[00:59.600 --> 01:03.520]  madsen investigative journalist that works for info wars dot com but out of
[01:03.520 --> 01:08.680]  big detailed report that i need instantly print that i saw an info wars dot
[01:08.680 --> 01:14.440]  com showing the massive persecution of christians in 2016 and 2015 with the
[01:14.440 --> 01:20.760]  current funding worldwide of george soros actually funding the persecution of
[01:20.760 --> 01:24.640]  christians by radical muslims all over the world it just shows the
[01:24.640 --> 01:28.400]  unprecedented war on christians and why they've opened up the borders to europe
[01:28.400 --> 01:33.920]  and more so we're focusing in on that obviously massive stock market thinking
[01:33.920 --> 01:39.400]  in the new year hundreds and hundreds of points per day since last friday we're
[01:39.400 --> 01:42.760]  going to be breaking that down several hundred points down on the dow jones
[01:42.760 --> 01:48.200]  industrial averages today we see the globalist openly trying to start a
[01:48.200 --> 01:53.520]  muslim civil war between shia and sunnis they've basically started a giant one
[01:53.520 --> 01:59.720]  but they want to start a huge world war out of this just huge situation saudi's
[01:59.720 --> 02:05.400]  cut ties to iran as christians intensifies federal raids quote round up
[02:05.400 --> 02:09.080]  immigrants this is a stunt they're bringing in tens of millions every few
[02:09.080 --> 02:13.960]  months every six months or so over a million total but if you look at the
[02:13.960 --> 02:18.360]  aggregate 40 million illegals or more in the country and they do a few of these
[02:18.360 --> 02:23.360]  stunts a few times a year to act like we've got some type of internal security
[02:23.360 --> 02:29.880]  we're going to be getting to that as well and then obviously what's been one
[02:29.880 --> 02:37.080]  of the biggest stories in the country and now in the world right on time feds
[02:37.080 --> 02:43.440]  tread lightly versus armed oregon grab and of course it's the feds that are
[02:43.440 --> 02:47.240]  really grabbing the property in oregon but this is the optics that we have
[02:47.240 --> 02:52.360]  basically in every major newspaper in the country today not that obama is
[02:52.360 --> 02:55.800]  currently speaking we can put him up on screen we're monitoring it but we have
[02:55.800 --> 03:00.600]  the press release this morning of what the executive order is the stories are
[03:00.600 --> 03:07.360]  on info wars dot com and drugs report dot com new obama gun rules require those
[03:07.360 --> 03:14.160]  selling even a single firearm to become licensed dealers that is a national
[03:14.160 --> 03:21.160]  national gun registry and we know what comes next in every single case we're
[03:21.160 --> 03:24.840]  gonna get Ted Nugent on the next few days we're gonna get Wayne LaPierre on
[03:24.840 --> 03:28.280]  the next few days we're going to get the head of gunners of America back on the
[03:28.280 --> 03:32.680]  next few days David 9 intervening last week warning us this was all coming but
[03:32.680 --> 03:36.840]  here it is and they're saying more is coming after this so I was thinking the
[03:36.840 --> 03:40.800]  draconian national registry would be in a few months after he tested the power
[03:40.800 --> 03:45.960]  grab of it being just an executive order outside of law we already have taxes
[03:45.960 --> 03:49.120]  outside of law we already have power plants being shut down outside of law
[03:49.120 --> 03:53.520]  we already have illegals being brought in outside of law the point is outside of
[03:53.520 --> 03:57.400]  law we all have al-qaeda and ISIS and al-Nusra being funded outside of law
[03:57.400 --> 04:02.600]  that's really the big enchilada here as this is outside of Congress and then
[04:02.600 --> 04:05.680]  you have the Supreme Court making laws after their blackmail that oh we can
[04:05.680 --> 04:10.120]  have a taxes for foreign insurance companies where you pay them it's a tax
[04:10.120 --> 04:16.720]  to insurance companies I mean the screw job is on the screw job is on it's here
[04:16.720 --> 04:22.960]  national registry that's what politico saying that's what world net daily is
[04:22.960 --> 04:28.360]  saying that's what the NRA is saying that's what Obama is saying and they're
[04:28.360 --> 04:33.160]  like reasonable you know within his power he can do it and then why am I here
[04:33.160 --> 04:39.280]  in Phoenix I had an over-the-top powerful two-hour interview with Lewis
[04:39.280 --> 04:43.240]  Farrakhan yesterday where he's on the same page believing they're trying to
[04:43.240 --> 04:47.440]  start a race war in America and I'm reaching out because he's so influential
[04:47.440 --> 04:50.680]  to try to make sure this doesn't happen and George Soros doesn't get what he
[04:50.680 --> 04:53.680]  wants stay with us
[04:59.000 --> 05:04.040]  while President Obama attempts to enact gun control via executive action a new
[05:04.040 --> 05:08.680]  Gallup poll shows that only 2% of Americans believe that guns or gun
[05:08.680 --> 05:13.720]  control are among the country's top problems Gallup asked about 1,000
[05:13.720 --> 05:17.680]  Americans in all 50 states what they thought the nation's top problems were
[05:17.680 --> 05:23.000]  in 2015 and out of 23 problems mentioned by Americans guns gun control
[05:23.000 --> 05:28.560]  ranked near the bottom at 19th in comparison 16% of Americans said that
[05:28.560 --> 05:34.080]  the government was the nation's biggest issue 13% said the economy 8% said
[05:34.080 --> 05:38.520]  unemployment and another eight said immigration but rather than working on
[05:38.520 --> 05:43.000]  these hot button issues both president Obama and the mainstream media would
[05:43.000 --> 05:47.440]  rather focus on gun control with a president even stating that he wants to
[05:47.440 --> 05:53.040]  quote make gun control part of his legacy end quote according to CNN you can

[08:53.400 --> 08:58.120]  the news center and will give us breaking news analysis and information
[08:58.120 --> 09:02.000]  throughout the day we also have Wayne Madsen investigative journalist info
[09:02.000 --> 09:07.080]  wars.com reporter wrote a very important article yesterday at info wars.com
[09:07.080 --> 09:13.680]  chronicling in the last year the massive funding that George Soros has given to
[09:13.680 --> 09:18.120]  radical Muslim leaders countries and others to persecute the living hell out
[09:18.120 --> 09:22.880]  of Christians you talk about serious crimes against humanity this Nazi war
[09:22.880 --> 09:28.640]  collaborator who runs the Obama White House is just unbelievably out of
[09:28.640 --> 09:33.680]  control and going out of his way to engage in massive persecution top 10
[09:33.680 --> 09:40.080]  Soros targets in 2016 and then it goes through Christians Soros will back the
[09:40.080 --> 09:44.520]  most anti-Christian pro-Muslim regimes and leaders worldwide in hellish
[09:44.520 --> 09:49.640]  persecution and hellish operations in Europe as well I mean we are up against
[09:49.640 --> 09:56.800]  just absolute evil here ladies and gentlemen it is incredible we're facing
[09:56.800 --> 10:02.640]  the class of civilizations we're facing the globalist trying to stage a huge
[10:02.640 --> 10:08.080]  Muslim civil war chiite against Sunni and vice versa that is in the news
[10:08.080 --> 10:11.680]  obviously today we've been telling you this is all coming because this is the
[10:11.680 --> 10:17.680]  season of orchestrated crisis this is the season of the stock market plunging
[10:17.680 --> 10:22.120]  as you see it doing hundreds of points a day since Friday this is the season of
[10:22.120 --> 10:26.880]  them coming for the guns this is the season of them provocaturing and trying
[10:26.880 --> 10:30.440]  to push federal initiatives that are unconstitutional so that people
[10:30.440 --> 10:35.520]  rightfully resist in their right but is it the smart thing to do at this point
[10:35.520 --> 10:41.040]  I say no unless you're defending yourself from an assault it's all coming up
[10:41.040 --> 10:47.480]  today Joe Biggs will also join us from the ground in Oregon where we have this
[10:47.480 --> 10:52.520]  empty federal barn or whatever that's been grabbed by folks that are mad about
[10:52.520 --> 10:56.600]  the federal land grabs and again you can look at both sides of this the feds
[10:56.600 --> 11:01.600]  are out of control they're grabbing land it's under agenda 21 but at the same
[11:01.600 --> 11:05.640]  time the Bundy's were on the right with grazing rights back to the 1870s we
[11:05.640 --> 11:11.120]  stood with them we supported them now that the sheriff says we don't want you a
[11:11.120 --> 11:17.040]  lot of the locals say that the Hammons have said for three days we you know
[11:17.040 --> 11:24.000]  please don't speak for us it just isn't as perfect an optics as we had in
[11:24.000 --> 11:28.200]  southern Nevada and the image of the feds putting their guns down and backing
[11:28.200 --> 11:30.800]  off or they threatened to shoot our reporter David Knight and others who
[11:30.800 --> 11:36.960]  were there with a thousand plus people now David Knight's son is on the ground
[11:36.960 --> 11:42.640]  there with Joe Biggs covering all of this now remember while we're all seeing
[11:42.640 --> 11:47.000]  every major newspaper in the country but in the Arizona Republic where I sit in
[11:47.000 --> 11:52.840]  Phoenix Arizona feds tread lightly versus armed Oregon grab it's the feds
[11:52.840 --> 11:58.000]  grabbing land it's the feds that have 90 percent of states like Nevada it's the
[11:58.000 --> 12:01.120]  feds that have more than half the country it's the feds they're trying to take it
[12:01.120 --> 12:04.920]  off use and acting like the people or the enemy it's the feds persecuting
[12:04.920 --> 12:09.400]  ranchers it's the feds wanting to get armored vehicles and local police
[12:09.400 --> 12:14.720]  departments and promoting this narrative that patriots land rights groups and
[12:14.720 --> 12:20.840]  others are about to come with guns and have a war right all of this kicking
[12:20.840 --> 12:26.240]  off Sunday into Monday when Obama announces yesterday and today national
[12:26.240 --> 12:31.240]  registry executive order outside of law that's a huge issue that's outside of
[12:31.240 --> 12:37.320]  law this is dictatorial the very textbook totalitarian dictatorship of the
[12:37.320 --> 12:44.120]  presidency Congress having its power stripped the lapdog Supreme Court
[12:44.120 --> 12:48.560]  signaling it's about to rule against guns this year already ruling last year
[12:48.560 --> 12:53.240]  that local cities can restrict guns down to the point of banning them backing up
[12:53.240 --> 12:58.680]  Chicago and others I mean it's on folks it's on it's on info wars.com
[12:58.680 --> 13:02.800]  worldnet daily drudge report.com we all have it broken down if I don't want to
[13:02.800 --> 13:06.280]  post the whole world that daily article info wars.com that's so important
[13:06.280 --> 13:12.280]  national registry we have to get that out to everyone Obama executive orders
[13:12.280 --> 13:16.400]  may require those selling even a single firearm to become licensed dealers
[13:16.400 --> 13:21.000]  boom this is what he just announced minutes ago and he keeps saying
[13:21.000 --> 13:24.560]  reasonable no big deal no big deal like it's reasonable to have forced
[13:24.560 --> 13:28.360]  inoculations it's reasonable to double and triple your insurance prices it's
[13:28.360 --> 13:32.720]  reasonable to teach five-year-olds how to have sex no it's not this is what
[13:32.720 --> 13:37.200]  they're doing just just running over us conditioning us so we'll go back to that
[13:37.200 --> 13:41.000]  Breitbart headline and we have the announcements Obama's gun control plan
[13:41.000 --> 13:46.960]  includes gun ban for some social security beneficiaries absolutely the FBI and
[13:46.960 --> 13:51.160]  I'm not lionizing the FBI but compared to the globalist in Obama I mean give me a
[13:51.160 --> 13:55.280]  break the FBI came out last year and said we've been told and we've been
[13:55.280 --> 14:01.440]  ready to the next center we're gonna be directed by experts quote at the VA with
[14:01.440 --> 14:09.120]  a algorithm that we are to apply with a computer with the data of the social
[14:09.120 --> 14:13.280]  security recipients how many millions are there sixty something million it's
[14:13.280 --> 14:17.720]  about to be a eighty something million as baby boomers retire I mean if that
[14:17.720 --> 14:21.520]  Google that how many social security recipients are there right now almost
[14:21.520 --> 14:26.120]  it's like 68 million 70 million but I'm going from memory here and if you do an
[14:26.120 --> 14:31.680]  automatic transfer this is the Washington Post this is the Washington Times with a
[14:31.680 --> 14:34.680]  straight face the New York Times last year just three or four months ago
[14:34.680 --> 14:40.240]  remember they said hey you take an automatic transfer your social security
[14:40.240 --> 14:44.160]  that means we declared you incompetent guess what they started this year
[14:44.160 --> 14:48.320]  they're trying to make it mandatory to take automatic transfers and if you
[14:48.320 --> 14:54.320]  don't they're gonna charge you a fee and now it's being reported by Politico it's
[14:54.320 --> 14:59.280]  being reported by Politico doctors can report some mentally ill patients to
[14:59.280 --> 15:05.040]  FBI under new gun rule you actually read what it says doctors can report you
[15:05.040 --> 15:08.400]  even though you're seeing a dentist you're seeing a clinic you're seeing
[15:08.400 --> 15:12.600]  whatever if they believe something might be going on and then no judge no jury
[15:12.600 --> 15:16.800]  you just lose your guns and they ask kids now pediatricians do your parents
[15:16.800 --> 15:21.800]  have guns if they say yes they've seen the guns the CPS is called Department of
[15:21.800 --> 15:25.200]  Health and Human Services he's gonna launch all these different agencies
[15:25.200 --> 15:32.000]  outside of law they've beta tested this in New York City Chicago and many areas
[15:32.000 --> 15:36.840]  of California like LA and they've beta tested it we know the attack we warned
[15:36.840 --> 15:42.400]  you with precision not because we're that smart the enemy runs a big country
[15:42.400 --> 15:47.280]  they've hijacked 330 million people 370 380 million you count the illegals they
[15:47.280 --> 15:53.040]  know how to implement there it is a federal mental health prohibitor that
[15:53.040 --> 15:57.040]  disqualifies them from shipping transporting possessing or receiving a
[15:57.040 --> 16:03.480]  firearm and they just decide a magic psychology list no judge no jury no
[16:03.480 --> 16:08.440]  adjudification that you're mentally ill it's hard you know since the 70s and the
[16:08.440 --> 16:11.520]  one who flew the cuckoo's nest and all those you know horrible things that
[16:11.520 --> 16:15.440]  happen locking people up for no reason to involuntarily commit people will
[16:15.440 --> 16:19.320]  forget all that we'll just put you on a no-gun buy list or a mentally ill list
[16:19.320 --> 16:23.800]  and of course they say that most gun owners are mentally ill Alan Dershowitz
[16:23.800 --> 16:27.960]  went on CNN and said Alex Jones is mentally ill he should have his guns
[16:27.960 --> 16:33.960]  taken it doesn't matter that I've never been convicted of even a misdemeanor
[16:33.960 --> 16:38.480]  other than pleading guilty to speeding which is one of the lowest classes of
[16:38.480 --> 16:45.200]  that I have never been convicted of anything above a $300 fine nothing
[16:45.200 --> 16:52.800]  I have never had a DWI I have never been a convicted of any crime I've never
[16:52.800 --> 16:56.640]  been audited by the IRS we've had to do some other probes and harassments but
[16:56.640 --> 17:02.680]  not a classic audit alleging something nothing I'm about as clean as you get
[17:02.680 --> 17:08.160]  I've even stopped speeding basically gosh it's hard to do but the point is a
[17:08.160 --> 17:12.920]  point even having a fast car anymore the whole point though is it doesn't matter
[17:12.920 --> 17:16.000]  that I'm Mr. Goodie tissues it doesn't matter I'm calling for peace in this
[17:16.000 --> 17:19.800]  country it doesn't matter I'm calling for reconciliation with the police and
[17:19.800 --> 17:23.800]  local communities it doesn't matter if I'm working for jobs in America it
[17:23.800 --> 17:28.400]  doesn't matter if I'm working for lower taxes we've got Obama and this gaggle
[17:28.400 --> 17:32.760]  of organized criminals that all have their own armed guards and security
[17:32.760 --> 17:38.120]  paid for by the taxpayers and he says we need a sense of urgency about gun
[17:38.120 --> 17:43.480]  violence when gun violence is down 60 something percent since 92 professor
[17:43.480 --> 17:47.880]  lot correct me it's not 52 percent like 61 percent and we can show you those
[17:47.880 --> 17:52.280]  statistics from the FBI.gov folks that we can show you the articles but they
[17:52.280 --> 17:57.720]  are coming with their jihad not about the economy imploding not about all the
[17:57.720 --> 18:01.640]  tyranny not about all the wars not about our government funding radical al-Qaeda
[18:01.640 --> 18:05.320]  and ISIS groups in the Civil War they kick off a civil war they kick off a war
[18:05.320 --> 18:09.400]  between Iran and Saudi Arabia none of that matters it's all about gun owners
[18:09.400 --> 18:13.320]  in America that's the big distraction even though in a national Gallup poll I
[18:13.320 --> 18:20.040]  saw yesterday 1% or was it 2% we'll pull it up of Americans believe that gun
[18:20.040 --> 18:23.880]  control is the number one issue that they're concerned with they can't even
[18:23.880 --> 18:31.080]  get 5% folks and by the way the number on Social Security 59 million Americans I
[18:31.080 --> 18:35.800]  know it was around 60 million but they're adding more all the time I think well
[18:35.800 --> 18:39.640]  then what two years will be 68 million and then upwards of 80 million and then
[18:39.640 --> 18:45.720]  by the end of the next decade so 59 million people and most of you get
[18:45.720 --> 18:49.560]  automatic money transfers they're coming for your guns and they'll go okay you
[18:49.560 --> 18:53.240]  can have them just go to a psychological just like you think it was fun to be a
[18:53.240 --> 18:56.840]  veteran and put their psychologicals to get your quote benefits that you earned
[18:56.840 --> 19:01.160]  now you're going to be harassed in the social services net they're coming
[19:01.160 --> 19:04.600]  they're coming with their agents they're coming with their operatives and
[19:04.600 --> 19:10.360]  bending over and groveling to it will only let them win gunband for some
[19:10.360 --> 19:17.480]  Social Security beneficiaries boom boom I mean it is on they are coming
[19:17.480 --> 19:22.120]  they've got their battle marks they're not backing down and info wars.com is

[19:33.000 --> 19:37.160]  Kit Daniels to hit every angle of this gun grab and put it all together I
[19:37.160 --> 19:42.600]  would take all these articles that cover one issue each and then just
[19:42.600 --> 19:47.080]  headline the you know the you know emergency alert total assaults on the
[19:47.080 --> 19:51.000]  Second Amendment launched and then just break down the seven different

[24:35.320 --> 24:39.160]  having social security recipients who get
[24:39.160 --> 24:43.160]  wire transfers of their money which they try to push you to do

[33:13.800 --> 33:20.840]  ladies and gentlemen we are back live we're going to be breaking down the
[33:20.840 --> 33:23.640]  big moves to destroy the second amendment that has been launched an
[33:23.640 --> 33:28.040]  incredibly treacherous moment of pure evil by the obama
[33:28.040 --> 33:32.040]  administration and the soros crime syndicate that is attempting to overthrow
[33:32.040 --> 33:36.680]  this country aamon bundy one of the bundy sons that is out in
[33:36.680 --> 33:41.000]  oregon is going to be interviewed this evening by joe big so we'll have that
[33:41.000 --> 33:45.480]  report for the nightly news this evening joe bigs will be popping in
[33:45.480 --> 33:51.080]  in the third hour from outside the compound the feds are calling it
[33:51.080 --> 33:54.440]  they're reporting that they're going to cut the quote power
[33:54.440 --> 33:58.200]  to it and again the controlled corporate press
[33:58.200 --> 34:02.040]  is calling them terrorist we have clips of cnn saying this
[34:02.040 --> 34:06.120]  and this goes back to harry reed calling the bundy's terrorist
[34:06.120 --> 34:09.320]  we were very supportive of the bundies and the folks that showed up out there
[34:09.320 --> 34:14.840]  and our reporters that covered it and still dealt with disinformation agents
[34:14.840 --> 34:18.760]  for whatever reason uh running around claiming that we hate the bundy's and
[34:18.760 --> 34:22.360]  you know hate everyone and think that land rights is horrible and
[34:22.360 --> 34:24.840]  and then of course the bundy's would go look it up we never said any of that
[34:24.840 --> 34:29.480]  about them in this case uh we have not said anything bad
[34:29.480 --> 34:32.680]  about the bundy's i think they have are in good faith as as david night said
[34:32.680 --> 34:36.040]  yesterday i concur with david night's analysis he was there with the feds
[34:36.040 --> 34:40.280]  threatening to shoot him last year we know that footage
[34:40.280 --> 34:43.960]  historic feds you know surrender to patriots is online with millions of
[34:43.960 --> 34:47.960]  youth but when you go out to a place and most
[34:47.960 --> 34:51.160]  the locals don't want you the sheriff doesn't want you
[34:51.160 --> 34:57.640]  uh and you've got uh the feds involved and you've got the
[34:57.640 --> 35:01.240]  hammons you know i first saturday you know heard the
[35:01.240 --> 35:04.920]  hammons didn't didn't didn't didn't want their help and i thought well that's
[35:04.920 --> 35:06.920]  certainly not true let me go look at that and then i wouldn't
[35:06.920 --> 35:12.200]  saw the hammons on tv saying it so all i'm saying is tactically
[35:12.200 --> 35:19.960]  and politically this does not look like uh the best situation to me
[35:19.960 --> 35:23.560]  and then the paranoia sets in or no one can come near the barn
[35:23.560 --> 35:26.440]  you know there are tactical positions and all this and then hardly anybody talks
[35:26.440 --> 35:30.120]  to the press and it just turns into what looks like
[35:30.120 --> 35:35.960]  a pretty bad situation to me with the simultaneous rollout
[35:35.960 --> 35:41.320]  of obama coming for the guns and saying they're for the patriots
[35:41.320 --> 35:45.320]  there's the obvious thing is when you see terror attacks in this country
[35:45.320 --> 35:48.360]  like we saw in san bernadino folks want to go out and get armed that's
[35:48.360 --> 35:52.200]  happening record gun sales so uh the timing of this
[35:52.200 --> 35:55.160]  thinks to high heaven and i'm saying there are individuals there are
[35:55.160 --> 35:58.440]  organizations there are groups there is media
[35:58.440 --> 36:02.440]  you know national media you name it in there stirring all this up
[36:02.440 --> 36:09.960]  cnn msnbc are having orgasms right now excuse my french of delight
[36:09.960 --> 36:14.440]  over this and sunday we're all blaming me for it alex jones followers are out
[36:14.440 --> 36:17.960]  there coming for a war hundreds of newspapers saying i want violence
[36:17.960 --> 36:22.440]  okay so i don't want violence i want to continue waking people up i want to
[36:22.440 --> 36:26.120]  see congress shoot down these executive orders
[36:26.120 --> 36:31.080]  i want to see lawsuits i want to see the nr a double in size gunners of america
[36:31.080 --> 36:34.040]  double in size i want to see governors like abit
[36:34.040 --> 36:37.240]  come and say come and take it and stand up that way
[36:37.240 --> 36:40.360]  with governors and state houses and legislatures and
[36:40.360 --> 36:44.840]  and you know men in suits professionally doing it when we can do it in a
[36:44.840 --> 36:49.160]  federally controlled area which is obviously wide open
[36:49.160 --> 36:53.800]  to be misrepresented i wouldn't choose to have a political battle
[36:53.800 --> 36:57.000]  i mean it's like you're down a swamp and they're up on a hill
[36:57.000 --> 37:02.120]  that's not good ground guys on horseback with american flags
[37:02.120 --> 37:06.040]  with men women and children riding up with the feds a men guns at them and
[37:06.040 --> 37:09.960]  the people right across the line onto their own grazing rights to get their
[37:09.960 --> 37:13.880]  cattle that have been stolen they had the moral right they had the
[37:13.880 --> 37:16.920]  right i mean i happen to know through sources that a lot of the tactical
[37:16.920 --> 37:20.120]  team military people that were in blm uniforms
[37:20.120 --> 37:25.480]  agreed with the bundes well now they've been able to bring in some teams that
[37:25.480 --> 37:27.960]  don't and i'll just tell you that we have a
[37:27.960 --> 37:32.120]  lot of sources and they don't hate the bundes but
[37:32.120 --> 37:38.360]  they're trying to not get the orders to have a shooting war and look i i admire
[37:38.360 --> 37:41.640]  the bundes but the media is calling them y'all
[37:41.640 --> 37:44.760]  kaida now the media the sorrow scripts are calling
[37:44.760 --> 37:48.040]  them white terrorists and doing banner hangs on highways they want to have a
[37:48.040 --> 37:51.640]  race war ladies and gentlemen and that's why i traveled
[37:51.640 --> 37:56.600]  this was set up a month ago that's why i traveled
[37:56.600 --> 38:00.120]  here sunday and i'm leaving today to phoenix arizona
[38:00.120 --> 38:05.320]  was to interview lewis farrakhan at alijah mohammad's original home
[38:05.320 --> 38:10.680]  and where lewis farrakhan stays much of the time
[38:10.680 --> 38:15.080]  and i came here to interview him on ways to not have
[38:15.080 --> 38:21.720]  extreme rhetoric on the government side the local side the police side the
[38:21.720 --> 38:25.720]  black muslim side the patriot side whatever the case is and
[38:25.720 --> 38:29.320]  it was a much better interview than i even thought two hours long
[38:29.320 --> 38:31.720]  uh we're going to be putting it out in the next few weeks they want to put it
[38:31.720 --> 38:33.240]  out i was going to take a month to put it out
[38:33.240 --> 38:35.560]  and really kind of make the documentary but they want to put it out quicker
[38:35.560 --> 38:39.320]  so we're going to race as fast as we can to put this out it's going to be
[38:39.320 --> 38:43.960]  a huge interview headlines are going to be all over the country about this
[38:43.960 --> 38:47.240]  i can tell you that lewis farrakhan said point blank
[38:47.240 --> 38:51.720]  at dinner last night very very gracious i was dinner with him for three hours
[38:51.720 --> 38:54.680]  with rob do and josh owens and then two hours two hours
[38:54.680 --> 38:57.720]  and ten minutes interviewing him before that
[38:57.720 --> 39:01.960]  that there is a grand jury that is open to indict him he's told they're coming
[39:01.960 --> 39:06.360]  to arresting very soon um and that he knows they're trying
[39:06.360 --> 39:08.920]  to cause a race war and a civil war in america
[39:08.920 --> 39:11.960]  and the things he said have been taken out of context when he said that the
[39:11.960 --> 39:15.160]  police shoot us in the back we go out and get them he said he meant the people
[39:15.160 --> 39:18.440]  that do it specifically but he said he understands that
[39:18.440 --> 39:22.520]  he said that in anger and that he agrees that
[39:22.520 --> 39:25.640]  all of god's children or all the tribes of israel
[39:25.640 --> 39:28.600]  need to come together against the new world order and the private fellow
[39:28.600 --> 39:32.040]  reserve and ladies and gentlemen
[39:32.040 --> 39:35.080]  i'm not going to tell you what else he said but because i'm going to coordinate
[39:35.080 --> 39:39.160]  with uh his people
[39:39.160 --> 39:42.600]  because he said some amazing things about
[39:42.600 --> 39:45.640]  donald trump you name it it's going to be a big interview
[39:45.640 --> 39:50.440]  so i was literally a month ago setting up this interview he invited me to his
[39:50.440 --> 39:52.600]  home in new york i couldn't go at that time
[39:52.600 --> 39:57.560]  because of family engagements so instead we we scheduled to interview him
[39:57.560 --> 40:01.960]  yesterday on the fourth we interviewed uh lewis fair con who is extremely charming
[40:01.960 --> 40:05.960]  and charismatic probably the most charismatic person
[40:05.960 --> 40:10.200]  i've been around people like rustle brand
[40:10.200 --> 40:14.200]  who you see on tv he's got some charisma but in person it's like whoa
[40:14.200 --> 40:18.120]  i mean it's like electric uh and you know there's all these women
[40:18.120 --> 40:20.840]  fawning on him he's like looks like six foot five and just
[40:20.840 --> 40:23.800]  built like swords today or once you're a random person he doesn't look as skinny
[40:23.800 --> 40:27.720]  and he just has this this presence lance armstrong has a big presence
[40:27.720 --> 40:32.360]  um janet reno has a really evil presence i've been right right up next to her
[40:32.360 --> 40:36.040]  clinton has an evil presence hillary clinton has is like a stinking presence
[40:36.040 --> 40:41.560]  um at drudge is like a smart presence um
[40:41.560 --> 40:47.000]  donald trump has a very energetic presence
[40:47.720 --> 40:52.200]  but i mean lewis fair con and i'm not doing a gushing thing here it's just that
[40:52.200 --> 40:55.720]  i want to have it's easy to get up here go do an interview
[40:55.720 --> 41:01.000]  attack lewis fair con put bad clips of him out of order and then just demonizing
[41:01.000 --> 41:04.520]  but i really do want to have peace i really do want to get the nation of
[41:04.520 --> 41:09.000]  islam talking about how they've aborted 51 of the blacks in this
[41:09.000 --> 41:12.600]  country since roe v wade and i said to him there's a thousand
[41:12.600 --> 41:16.440]  100 people shot by cops on average they admit over 90 of that
[41:16.440 --> 41:19.640]  is in good faith cops getting shot at bank robbers
[41:19.640 --> 41:23.400]  liquor store robberies whatever and i said to him
[41:23.400 --> 41:28.360]  i said you've got you've got what is it 20 million blacks or so aborted since
[41:28.360 --> 41:32.520]  roe v wade hundreds of thousands millions every couple years
[41:32.520 --> 41:37.720]  you got millions over here on this side of the way on the scales
[41:37.720 --> 41:42.120]  half the black people killed and then over here on this side
[41:42.120 --> 41:47.000]  you've got 150 people that are questionable a year by the police
[41:47.000 --> 41:50.200]  and and you know let's say
[41:50.360 --> 41:55.000]  that are black out of the thousand or so uh that um
[41:55.000 --> 41:58.280]  that probably shouldn't have been shot
[41:58.680 --> 42:03.160]  and i don't let's be technical there's 1100 or so police shootings
[42:03.160 --> 42:05.640]  and there's only a couple hundred that you could say were questionable
[42:05.640 --> 42:08.840]  conservatively so we're not even talking about i mean total the numbers are
[42:08.840 --> 42:10.840]  insane we've got to break this down it's like
[42:10.840 --> 42:14.360]  end of the world the police are coming to kill us
[42:14.360 --> 42:17.480]  what's coming to take over is your smart car taxing you by the mall what's
[42:17.480 --> 42:20.360]  coming to get you is the smart meter frying you in your house
[42:20.360 --> 42:24.360]  what's coming to get you is fluoride in the water what's coming to get you is
[42:24.360 --> 42:28.920]  cancer viruses and the vaccines what's coming to get us is the soft kill
[42:28.920 --> 42:33.000]  new world order but lewis ferrican said
[42:33.000 --> 42:36.920]  islam is a failed religion and needs to be reformed
[42:36.920 --> 42:41.240]  he said we need to block muslims coming into the us until we put controls on
[42:41.240 --> 42:44.680]  in fact i think the ferrican people are right they said the interview was so
[42:44.680 --> 42:48.840]  powerful they wanted out basically now and i was like well i want to add a
[42:48.840 --> 42:52.040]  bunch of clips and make it really uh you know what i'm gonna call them back
[42:52.040 --> 42:56.360]  today in fact do you come in here please
[42:56.360 --> 42:59.080]  i'll talk to you during the break about what tom or flight is i don't want to
[42:59.080 --> 43:01.160]  run back by there and talk to their video people
[43:01.160 --> 43:04.280]  you know that had us in their studio because the more i think about it the
[43:04.280 --> 43:07.960]  stuff he said it's like drudge came to us and just dumped his guts
[43:07.960 --> 43:11.800]  you know just all the data dump it was awesome and that's the thing i want to
[43:11.800 --> 43:14.280]  be the place where people can come and spill their
[43:14.280 --> 43:17.000]  guts i want to be the place where matt drudge comes
[43:17.000 --> 43:19.720]  and says i met with the supreme court justice and they're coming for the first
[43:19.720 --> 43:22.440]  amendment next year they're coming for the second
[43:22.440 --> 43:26.280]  and the supreme court signaled last friday or last thursday
[43:26.280 --> 43:29.640]  they signaled oh we're coming for the guns and free speech this year i mean
[43:29.640 --> 43:33.160]  folks this is an epic time and we don't want to be
[43:33.160 --> 43:37.320]  white black whatever hispanic killing each other right now
[43:37.320 --> 43:39.960]  as we defeat the new world order we want to be idiots and kill each other
[43:39.960 --> 43:43.160]  whatever go ahead and do it i don't want that to happen but i really do
[43:43.160 --> 43:47.240]  not want it on my soul in my conscience that my government is targeting all the
[43:47.240 --> 43:51.000]  children for abortion but they want to abort the whole human species
[43:51.000 --> 43:55.160]  now david knights with us here he's got a lot to cover but i tell you david
[43:55.160 --> 44:00.440]  this situation in oregon is going exactly like we said it would on sunday
[44:00.440 --> 44:04.840]  people go back to those facebook mentions and the youtube i shot
[44:04.840 --> 44:08.680]  and then the sunday show that you hosted and we're just stating the facts
[44:08.680 --> 44:12.280]  everybody knows we're 110 percent supporters of land rights we're 110
[44:12.280 --> 44:15.240]  percent supporters of the second amendment we're 110 percent supporters of the
[44:15.240 --> 44:18.280]  first amendment we're 110 percent supporters of states rights
[44:18.280 --> 44:22.360]  we're 110 percent supporters of good governors like greg abbott thank god for
[44:22.360 --> 44:25.080]  him in this critical time we've got him and not rick barry who was a fake
[44:25.080 --> 44:29.720]  conservative compared to him and think obviously better than obama
[44:29.720 --> 44:34.040]  thank god that you know that that we've been in a position to warn people but
[44:34.040 --> 44:38.760]  man i gotta say joe biggs told me he's gonna come on next
[44:38.760 --> 44:43.400]  middle of the third hour multiple times he's just out there to report cover the
[44:43.400 --> 44:46.520]  press conference uh see what's happening
[44:46.520 --> 44:49.640]  and he had some of the prominent militia people who i don't know their names i
[44:49.640 --> 44:52.600]  don't know who all these people are and i barely you know can remember all the
[44:52.600 --> 44:56.600]  bundy's names uh you know there's like four or five of them
[44:56.600 --> 45:01.400]  and they just march up and go thanks a lot for saying the bundy's are feds
[45:01.400 --> 45:04.280]  and then joe goes where was that said on alex's show
[45:04.280 --> 45:07.720]  really where was it said oh i guess you didn't say it but
[45:07.720 --> 45:10.920]  and then we know that that's what people do they come up and say
[45:10.920 --> 45:15.080]  alex jones says you're fed they go well help do you and then once they've
[45:15.080 --> 45:19.160]  already buddied up and you know said alex is saying we're feds
[45:19.160 --> 45:22.520]  everybody gets to be on this high horse see the great alex jones he's not
[45:22.520 --> 45:27.320]  as patriot as we are you know he says we're feds i said watch your butt
[45:27.320 --> 45:30.440]  because harry reid has said you're a domestic terrorist and wants to demonize
[45:30.440 --> 45:34.280]  all of us and you speak for us now and they're coming for our guns and all
[45:34.280 --> 45:38.040]  the people that are in the comment sections on info wars the minority of
[45:38.040 --> 45:41.240]  trolls that want to shoot and war you're the ones that always tell other people
[45:41.240 --> 45:44.040]  to go out and have a shooting war you're the ones that are always out there
[45:44.040 --> 45:47.640]  pushing somebody else do it let me tell you something big man
[45:47.640 --> 45:50.760]  you go ahead and go do it if you think it's so great no i say you shouldn't do
[45:50.760 --> 45:53.720]  it let me tell you want to shoot and war you're probably going to get one
[45:53.720 --> 45:56.600]  and it's when the globalists that have taken over this country blow up some
[45:56.600 --> 46:00.680]  more federal buildings or shoot up a you know a school and blame it on the
[46:00.680 --> 46:04.840]  patriot movement because let me tell you just as day follows
[46:04.840 --> 46:09.320]  night in sitcoms and dramas and cartoons and newspapers and tv and radio
[46:09.320 --> 46:13.000]  they've been demonizing the patriots for seven years saying we're getting ready
[46:13.000 --> 46:16.360]  to start killing everybody and taking over buildings and murdering everyone
[46:16.360 --> 46:19.160]  and then when they start pulling it or tricking people into it
[46:19.160 --> 46:23.000]  it's on folks we're winning politically right now
[46:23.000 --> 46:26.920]  we are winning in this wrestling match they don't want us to continue to win
[46:26.920 --> 46:29.160]  and they've got their operatives out in force
[46:29.160 --> 46:33.560]  hammering right now everywhere pushing to try to start a civil war
[46:33.560 --> 46:37.000]  but i'll tell you we don't just have to count on the grassroots patriots out
[46:37.000 --> 46:40.360]  there to be smart a lot of mar really smart and god bless them and they're
[46:40.360 --> 46:43.480]  angry and i could admire the fact they're ready to fight
[46:43.480 --> 46:47.480]  but let me tell you the art of war fight on your terms when you want to 90% of
[46:47.480 --> 46:51.160]  war is info war i'm going to tell you something right now
[46:51.160 --> 46:55.080]  there are people in the fbi in all these agencies that know
[46:55.080 --> 46:59.240]  that their bosses want to start a civil war and want to create a huge crisis
[46:59.240 --> 47:02.760]  where they can get draconian laws passed and smoke screen all these executive
[47:02.760 --> 47:06.840]  orders to take our guns and i can tell you that
[47:06.840 --> 47:12.040]  saturday i met with a prominent individual
[47:12.040 --> 47:14.760]  and i've met with other prominent individuals and i'm going to leave it at
[47:14.760 --> 47:18.200]  that and i have confirmed in triplicate that the reason the secret
[47:18.200 --> 47:21.640]  service is being persecuted of course in agency that big there's going to be a
[47:21.640 --> 47:25.320]  drunk driving incident or a hooker or something big i'm not saying that's okay
[47:25.320 --> 47:29.480]  but that's out there for a reason because they hate that agency because it
[47:29.480 --> 47:33.000]  gets to see what the president's doing and by the way those people are smart
[47:33.000 --> 47:36.920]  they don't tell me what they're seeing because i'd get killed if i knew
[47:36.920 --> 47:39.960]  but they say like bonjino said the former head of his foreign detail said
[47:39.960 --> 47:44.440]  here and i want him back on it's worse than you're saying alex
[47:44.440 --> 47:49.080]  well finally through two sources
[47:49.400 --> 47:53.720]  ladies and gentlemen they say that obama is not just a radical muslim
[47:53.720 --> 47:57.960]  sympathizer but he whether it's a psi op to leak
[47:57.960 --> 48:00.600]  back to saudi arabia or israel or whatever
[48:00.600 --> 48:05.000]  obama is hitting his knees he wears a radical ahabia's ring
[48:05.000 --> 48:08.840]  obama actually prays to mecca five times a day folks he grew up
[48:08.840 --> 48:12.680]  he went to madrasa's in indonesia he is a muslim
[48:12.680 --> 48:17.480]  he is a sunni muslim folks so i bow to the king of saudi arabia
[48:17.480 --> 48:21.560]  and every other i mean i mean folks we are screwed
[48:21.560 --> 48:25.240]  if if i was ever going to evacuate and get my family out of here it'd be i've
[48:25.240 --> 48:28.200]  pledged to stay here but i mean when you're facing
[48:28.200 --> 48:33.080]  a radical jihad president i mean when you're facing them coming for the guns
[48:33.080 --> 48:36.840]  god almighty i mean we they're trying to start war with
[48:36.840 --> 48:40.280]  russia they're attacking russia with radical muslims
[48:40.280 --> 48:43.320]  i can't even believe david night i cannot even
[48:43.320 --> 48:49.880]  believe and the feds are saying to to me and others look just don't let them
[48:49.880 --> 48:54.520]  start a civil war we don't want this we're not going to follow orders to come
[48:54.520 --> 48:56.760]  take the guns they're going to do it in a few cities
[48:56.760 --> 49:01.400]  we don't want a civil war we know it's true we know we the patriots are winning
[49:01.400 --> 49:04.920]  folks the generals are going public saying the
[49:04.920 --> 49:08.360]  government runs al-qaeda so i'm telling you they're in trouble
[49:08.360 --> 49:12.120]  folks we're that close to beating them politically
[49:12.120 --> 49:16.120]  they want to destroy this country and of course they got bad feds in there that
[49:16.120 --> 49:18.440]  hate patriots like laun horayuchi and others that's
[49:18.440 --> 49:22.360]  retired but most of them aren't stupid and they see the writing on the wall
[49:22.360 --> 49:27.320]  and if we get past this narrative of just having an idiotic shooting war
[49:27.320 --> 49:30.360]  we can save this country peacefully now the the globalists are going to do
[49:30.360 --> 49:33.400]  false flags my god we got a while hobbyist in the white house
[49:33.400 --> 49:36.840]  and you know i used to hear that say it wasn't true it's true
[49:36.840 --> 49:42.040]  it's true we are screwed folks unless we hit our knees before god
[49:42.040 --> 49:45.080]  david i'm gonna skip this break this is so important and i know more today but
[49:45.080 --> 49:50.920]  i mean i literally got physically nauseous saturday
[49:50.920 --> 49:54.520]  when i confirmed through another high level source
[49:54.520 --> 50:00.440]  in person in person and i'm not going to give out any
[50:00.440 --> 50:06.280]  details what agency uh let's just say armors
[50:06.280 --> 50:11.560]  with a major federal agency okay i mean it is on david they are scared
[50:11.560 --> 50:15.800]  well you know i was uh i remember when uh when obama began to run back in
[50:15.800 --> 50:20.600]  2000 for the 2008 election the new york times reported that he began one of
[50:20.600 --> 50:25.320]  the rallies with a perfect muslim call to prayer nobody recorded that supposedly
[50:25.320 --> 50:28.520]  and we never heard any more about that they took that off of the
[50:28.520 --> 50:32.120]  off of the narrative but that's been there from the very beginning of course
[50:32.120 --> 50:36.280]  there were a lot of questions as to uh after he spent most of his life growing
[50:36.280 --> 50:40.440]  up in indonesia uh the uh and the connections there to that
[50:40.440 --> 50:45.480]  brutal government that's being run by the cia his wife uh being his mother
[50:45.480 --> 50:50.840]  being connected to a family that was part of the uh the cia in the early
[50:50.840 --> 50:54.520]  years the foundational years and then he disappears and he goes to pakistan he
[50:54.520 --> 50:57.240]  comes back and his name is changed there's no records about that we have
[50:57.240 --> 51:00.120]  absolutely no background checks on this president
[51:00.120 --> 51:03.800]  who is demanding background checks on everybody and i was right there is a
[51:03.800 --> 51:08.840]  billion 200 million muslims a billion
[51:08.840 --> 51:13.480]  80 million plus are sooning about a third of those are radicals on record
[51:13.480 --> 51:16.600]  and of course the global is just one of the biggest population group
[51:16.600 --> 51:19.640]  set them all up they probably had it planned for 50 years with saudi arabian
[51:19.640 --> 51:22.520]  oil and all of it we've been double-crossed our shields are down
[51:22.520 --> 51:27.000]  we're screwed i mean if america doesn't understand how
[51:27.000 --> 51:32.280]  david david i've never been this shaken i've never it's all coming together we
[51:32.280 --> 51:35.560]  have been this is the this is the end of america
[51:35.560 --> 51:40.040]  yes yes if he if he gets the open water yeah i hope all you feds that have gone
[51:40.040 --> 51:43.400]  along with this are proud of yourselves and i and i and i hope all the people
[51:43.400 --> 51:46.680]  out there that have been lazy are proud of yourselves because look you try to
[51:46.680 --> 51:49.640]  say it the borders are wide open they ordered the border patrol to ship the
[51:49.640 --> 51:52.840]  illegals in i mean we're folks it's a joke it's all totally
[51:52.840 --> 51:55.080]  illegal sorry david go ahead make your point
[51:55.080 --> 51:58.680]  no actually alex there's a couple of articles up on info wars today
[51:58.680 --> 52:02.760]  one of them about the german police covering up massive assaults on new
[52:02.760 --> 52:06.680]  year's eve and cologne near the train station they had about 500 young arab
[52:06.680 --> 52:10.520]  and north american men flooded the square there they attacked
[52:10.520 --> 52:14.120]  at least 35 women were subjected to sexual assault one report of rape
[52:14.120 --> 52:17.800]  they expect that number to go up there's another report on info wars that come
[52:17.800 --> 52:22.200]  about uh norway and uh oslo the capital the
[52:22.200 --> 52:26.520]  police are saying we have lost the city and it is a quote we have lost the city
[52:26.520 --> 52:30.280]  we have lost the city mayday mayday it's true we're under attack we've been
[52:30.280 --> 52:33.480]  double crossed it's exactly what all the right wingers said i didn't believe
[52:33.480 --> 52:38.440]  them this is insane folks this is insane and it's worse than that
[52:38.440 --> 52:41.080]  they're now storming churches and ransacking
[52:41.080 --> 52:44.280]  and literally raping people in the pews mainstream news
[52:44.280 --> 52:48.040]  and the politically correct are taking it as a sacrament they love it
[52:48.040 --> 52:51.320]  what filth what do all these liberals think they're going to do when they're
[52:51.320 --> 52:53.880]  under sharia law well you know alex what they're
[52:53.880 --> 52:58.040]  saying is that uh gremlin which is this uh ghetto area that's an oslo
[52:58.040 --> 53:01.480]  just two strain train stops from the parliament they're saying that area is
[53:01.480 --> 53:05.000]  more muslim than morocco and of course that's in
[53:05.000 --> 53:08.520]  norway that's that's it there's nothing left of that
[53:08.520 --> 53:12.040]  area of europe they come in they create ghettos because they don't want
[53:12.040 --> 53:15.880]  to mix with the europeans that are there they don't want to learn their language
[53:15.880 --> 53:17.800]  they don't want to interact with them they want to be
[53:17.800 --> 53:22.920]  lewis fair con to my face said islam has failed and needs to be reformed
[53:22.920 --> 53:25.560]  well i i agree with him i certainly agree with him
[53:25.560 --> 53:28.840]  well part of the problem is over the top part of the problem is it is when
[53:28.840 --> 53:33.080]  these migrants come in they are self ghettoizing they they create their own
[53:33.080 --> 53:36.040]  ghetto uh not just because there's a cultural
[53:36.040 --> 53:39.240]  and a language difference that we would see as other immigrant groups would
[53:39.240 --> 53:41.480]  come in from europe in the early 20th century
[53:41.480 --> 53:44.840]  they want that they don't want to change that they want to be separate
[53:44.840 --> 53:49.640]  they just want to take control uh and and that is a recipe for disaster
[53:49.640 --> 53:52.280]  because the kids absolutely and i want to expand on this
[53:52.280 --> 53:56.440]  i want to expand on this my biggest concern is they're going to provocateur
[53:56.440 --> 54:01.160]  patriots into violence pushing stuff the feds the citizens everybody needs to
[54:01.160 --> 54:04.600]  decide they're americans right now and cooler heads prevail and realize
[54:04.600 --> 54:07.800]  the bigger picture of the globalist takeover the financial collapse it's
[54:07.800 --> 54:11.160]  already beginning all of it we got to come together come on folks
[54:11.160 --> 54:14.760]  choose the right side don't just hate each other over race or if somebody's
[54:14.760 --> 54:18.360]  a patriot or a fed or whatever let's really think about what side we're on
[54:18.360 --> 54:21.080]  here and just come together and i'm really worried that people are going to
[54:21.080 --> 54:25.480]  get fed up and attack mosques or attack muslims most muslims that
[54:25.480 --> 54:28.200]  had actually come here in the past were because i know and we're fleeing
[54:28.200 --> 54:31.560]  tyranny iraqis and others that wanted their daughters to go to college and
[54:31.560 --> 54:35.560]  are good people they're bringing in the radicals now to police those muslims
[54:35.560 --> 54:38.840]  that our government's allied with the bad muslims with the with the with the
[54:38.840 --> 54:41.400]  Saudis with the with the people that chopped off
[54:41.400 --> 54:46.520]  47 heads this weekend and do not attack muslims folks
[54:46.520 --> 54:49.960]  that will only allow this to intensify we have got
[54:49.960 --> 54:53.400]  to point out the borders are wide open and that this is treason
[54:53.400 --> 54:57.800]  politically obama is a lame duck and hated we need to make congress and the
[54:57.800 --> 55:02.040]  governors begin reversing this we need emergency legislative sessions
[55:02.040 --> 55:05.720]  in the state of texas and others to block the refugees to block the gun
[55:05.720 --> 55:08.760]  control that will be the bully pulpit the states coming
[55:08.760 --> 55:11.960]  together we need governors to say and don't you do any
[55:11.960 --> 55:15.560]  provocateur stuff globalist because the globalists are known
[55:15.560 --> 55:18.440]  and we're weaponizing the patriots in the info war
[55:18.440 --> 55:22.120]  the governors and others know the truth now and many congressmen and women
[55:22.120 --> 55:25.880]  and they're already like donald trump's doing they're ready to call bill
[55:25.880 --> 55:29.000]  clinton a rapist they're ready to to to hammer them
[55:29.000 --> 55:32.200]  with false flag terror that they've staged let me tell you the gloves are
[55:32.200 --> 55:34.680]  ready to come off with the real patriots in america
[55:34.680 --> 55:37.880]  but even as fast as the awakenings happening it's not
[55:37.880 --> 55:42.200]  hardcore enough they're coming for the guns we told you
[55:42.200 --> 55:45.880]  and frankly it's worse i thought this would be in round two salvo
[55:45.880 --> 55:48.840]  he said he's going to keep having them for months i thought the national
[55:48.840 --> 55:51.880]  registration and the psychological stuff and taking
[55:51.880 --> 55:55.240]  them from social security recipients that would come in phase two

[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:51.400]  persecution of christians worldwide by george soros
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:57.640]  we're tied into the big gun grab push the open borders the lawlessness
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:03.720]  and now the bundies with the sheriff most the locals and the hammons against
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:10.600]  them are there in a federal barn a little
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:18.040]  federal shed and asking armed people to come
[01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:20.600]  there to stand up against the federal land grab
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:24.920]  i'm not against the bundies as everybody knows i am allowed to have my view
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:28.440]  that i don't think this is the best time to be doing this
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:35.160]  um and i admire the courage but uh
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:37.880]  david not i tell you the biggest assault on the second amendment since they
[01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:42.040]  came for the guns at lexington concord and and right the day this all kicks off
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:44.120]  they get to have it all over the newspapers that
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:47.400]  armed patriots you know take over a building i mean that just
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:53.000]  my god yeah alex i i think uh what we've been saying and we were saying at
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.640]  uh sunday but even before that alex we had a hothead blogger who was there at
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:01.320]  the site attacking stewart rhodes because he was saying look
[01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:05.400]  the people there don't want your protection you can't as he's telling
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:08.600]  other oathkeepers he said go there and protest that's fine that's a legitimate
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:12.200]  thing to do but in terms of protection operation they haven't asked for your
[01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:15.160]  protection they did a cordon around the uh the uh
[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:19.720]  gold the gold mine out in oregon uh trying to make sure that the
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:23.880]  blm was not going to go in and raise that place to the ground
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:27.960]  before they had due process that's what the blm was threatening to do and so
[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:31.800]  they're protecting us to go exactly you supported that exactly and i i looked
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:35.320]  at what was happening with this and from the time they came back and and lost
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:38.440]  their appeal and it looked like they were going to be going to prison
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:41.960]  they kept pushing back through their lawyer saying we don't want
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:44.600]  anybody to stand in the gap here we're just going to go to prison so
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:48.280]  this was the wrong place it was the wrong time not only
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:51.480]  uh the fact that it's in the dead of winter but with what obama was pulling
[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:55.560]  with uh gun control and it was the wrong community to do this and most of these
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:58.440]  people have a reservation and holiday there in oregon
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:01.080]  we're going to review the hammers we're going to review uh one of the bundes
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:04.600]  today yeah it's a just it's a just cause but they're
[01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:07.560]  just doing it the wrong way i believe that's and that's what we've said from
[01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:10.040]  the beginning uh that's what steward roge was saying even
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:14.600]  before we started talking about it even before the takeover of that facility
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:17.480]  i'm probably related to these people hammon is just the hammon with the
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:22.600]  detaking off anglophile german name uh i'm probably related to these people
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:26.280]  but i tell you it you know the whole thing's just completely out of control
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:30.760]  and it's just looks so scripted i'm not saying the bundes are scripting it
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:34.280]  i'm saying you got to know when to hold them know when to fold them know when
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:36.920]  to walk away know when to run you marched with them you were one of the
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:40.200]  first to go across the line and reported the feds threatening to shoot you
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:42.360]  david yeah you were unarmed you did that you have
[01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:46.040]  incredible courage and then you know we've been there we're in the movement
[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:49.880]  and we help build the liberty movement well here's a difference elix and and
[01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:53.800]  that situation you had the entire community was upset about the fact that
[01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:57.080]  they were attacking people uh they had run all these ranchers out of business
[01:03:57.080 --> 01:04:00.680]  they had set up a first amendment area everything about that was just
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:03.720]  oppression and so the entire community came together
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:07.400]  along with people from the outside to protect them they had a very well-defined
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:11.400]  goal that could be achieved could de-escalate that situation
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:14.840]  they played that exactly right but the important thing was the entire community
[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:18.040]  was there together here in oregon over half of the people worked for the
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:20.920]  federal government over half of the land is owned by the federal government
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:23.720]  they have a reservation mentality even the people
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:28.440]  who are being so severely abused these hammons uh who are going to voluntarily
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:31.640]  go back to jail so they have a slave mentality
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:34.840]  yeah they have a slave mentality when you live out there around nothing but
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:39.320]  the feds controlling everything it is wrong and i admire the western spirit
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:42.440]  of the bundes uh but i'm allowed to sit here and say
[01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:45.800]  i think provocateurs are going to try to stir this up the media is going with
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:48.760]  this they're trying to demonize quote white terrorist and y'all
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:51.000]  kyda this goes right into the whole globalist
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.560]  narrative and that's a fact and no one can deny it
[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:57.400]  so we're just pointing out the full spectrum of this this is what we do
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:01.400]  stay there you're riding shotgun david while president obama attempts to enact
[01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:05.880]  gun control via executive action a new gallup poll shows that only two percent
[01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:09.240]  of americans believe that guns or gun control
[01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:14.520]  are among the country's top problems gallup asked about 1000 americans in all
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:18.760]  50 states what they thought the nation's top problems were in 2015
[01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:23.080]  and out of 23 problems mentioned by americans guns gun control
[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:26.600]  ranked near the bottom at 19th in comparison
[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:30.200]  16 percent of americans said that the government was the nation's biggest
[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:33.960]  issue 13 percent said the economy 8 percent said
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:38.360]  unemployment and another eight said immigration but rather than working on
[01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:41.240]  these hot button issues both president obama
[01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:44.920]  and the mainstream media would rather focus on gun control
[01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:47.960]  with a president even stating that he wants to quote
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:52.440]  make gun control part of his legacy end quote according to cnn

[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:28.760]  viewers think that gun control is the number one
[01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:33.000]  issue in america the vast majority of americans are against
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.160]  turning in their guns or restricting guns gallop only two percent say guns
[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:40.760]  gun control among nations most important problems
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:45.400]  well that's about right uh guns are if you look at the world almanac

[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:41.880]  out of two million cops i'm not defending the police
[01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:45.480]  they do unconstitutional stuff they're taking orders from a corrupt taken over
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:48.440]  government in many cases i'm the guy that made police state films
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:51.240]  i'm the guy that wrote books on it i'm the guy that exposed the biometrics
[01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:55.640]  coming the smart cars 20 years ago the everything
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:59.960]  but then george foros comes along and literally funds a leftist attempt to
[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:04.360]  overthrow local governments i'm against it
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:11.800]  and i found no one more awake than the military special ops
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:17.400]  it's like 98 percent it's unbelievable how awake they are
[01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:21.640]  it's incredible how patriotic they are
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:29.000]  army 90 away general army marines about the same i'm not bashing the navy
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.400]  they're great people but navy folks will tell you
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:34.920]  there's something about following going along the system i may be 60 or awake
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:38.520]  i've talked to the navy out of the marines are assigned to that but
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:42.440]  they're more awake i'm not bashing the navy it's just something i've noticed
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:45.800]  and you notice it's the army that just continues to resist all this
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:49.960]  the generals the leaks the info and that's because the army actually does all
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:55.240]  the really nasty stuff the army's the big muscle
[01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:01.400]  the army's like the 100 foot tall troll and then navy seals and the rest of her
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:04.840]  like a 20 foot troll but the big mean troll hides back in the dark
[01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:08.520]  big mean troll is going on all the bad missions doing all the nasty stuff
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:12.120]  big mean troll doesn't like what's going on
[01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:16.520]  and so they want to start a civil war in this country
[01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:20.920]  the military is the most awake local police are the next most awake and i'm
[01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:23.560]  the guy that used to literally go around screaming and
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:26.360]  police's face and bullying them everywhere because they were following
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:30.120]  unconstitutional orders i was upset i thought i could make them wake up and
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:36.840]  they'd say hey though change the laws we're trying to follow the constitution
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:41.960]  and it is true we should change the laws about the tsa we should change the
[01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:45.160]  laws about federalization of police and acid forward to seizure we should
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:48.920]  change the laws we need to get up off our butts
[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:52.520]  but i'm not going to sit here now while they're trying to start a civil war
[01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:55.720]  and do all this and now another grips awake
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:58.360]  few years ago they couldn't get the dallas police to attack us at the jfk
[01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:01.640]  memorial so they had the democrat operative sheriff order the sheriff's
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:04.680]  department in dallas loupe whatever her name is obama

[01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:07.080]  service on the air but i've talked to people off record
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:10.840]  where they are scared folks and they go look man

[01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:31.800]  but i heard from two different high-level people
[01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:37.960]  in the last month i get chills talking about this folks
[01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:43.240]  that obama is like a literal villain behind the scenes
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:47.320]  and that they talk to the secret service like they are the dogs
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:50.040]  and scream at them and tell them they're dumb idiots and
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:53.080]  and and they say they can't get it all the stuff that's going on but he's not
[01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:55.800]  just a muslim sympathizer with radical islam
[01:13:55.800 --> 01:14:03.240]  obama folks is hardcore wahhabist he is al-qaeda
[01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:07.320]  i mean you talk about the ultimate twist folks the government saudi arabia
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:11.160]  runs a terror attack on america takes out saddam who was fighting al-qaeda
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:13.800]  loots that country uses it a base to invade syria
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:17.640]  he stabilizes overthrows our allies in egypt over the kills everybody
[01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:22.440]  in libya and then they put and maybe that's a front to fool saudi arabian the

[01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:42.120]  and they gave his his cousin the prime minister ship
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:45.480]  and how did the radical muslims respond they started blowing up buildings
[01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:49.320]  shooting up shopping malls and now his little buddies are over here

[01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:32.920]  you're not some right winger i'd call you more of a overall patriotic
[01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:37.000]  libertarian progressive not in the george soro sense but is a real one
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.160]  uh classical liberal whatever i mean you know five years ago when you were
[01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:44.440]  saying obama you know work does have weird muslim ties i was
[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:49.400]  still pooping that i've got sources in the white house
[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:52.040]  i mean i don't know if it's a scythe or whatever but he's hitting his knees to
[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:55.080]  mecca uh he's trying to destroy the country i i'm
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:58.520]  going to get into soros funding attacks on christians all over the world i mean
[01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:05.560]  what's the grand plan here wane madson well i i think soros is the master of
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:12.440]  chaos uh i he he actually has figured out a way to make
[01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:19.400]  money through constant disruption and constant chaos whether it's financial
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:25.000]  chaos holly shorts national currencies or by uh funding these
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.560]  street demonstrations that eventually turn into full scale uh kuday
[01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:33.000]  ties like we saw happened in ukraine and georgia
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.920]  and in the so-called arab spring which he bankrolled also
[01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:42.840]  libya egypt tunisia uh the funding uh the the uprising in syria with all of
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:47.400]  its disastrous effects and now we've got soros telling europe
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:51.240]  yeah you've taken in a million of these muslim migrants
[01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:55.320]  mostly from the middle east north africa but you can take in a few million
[01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:57.880]  more and and now it's being reported it's not
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:01.720]  being reported here because of the political correctness issue and i think
[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:07.240]  trump is really on to something with his uh his tirade on political correctness
[01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:12.280]  but uh we just had reports on new year's eve out in germany
[01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:16.280]  thousands of these jihadi gang bangers
[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:19.880]  going around in wolf packs basically raping
[01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:23.080]  german women who are out celebrating new year's eve
[01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:25.960]  now we have video of it we're going to skip this network break this is so
[01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:28.920]  important let's let's show the articles at info wars dot com
[01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:33.240]  of mass gang rapes 35 women raped at once police standing down
[01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:37.000]  churches being raided i mean this is a foaming at the mouth jihadis
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.360]  that couldn't take over syria the russians kicked them out so now they
[01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:44.920]  went back to turkey and they dumped them in europe i mean this is over the top
[01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:49.000]  yeah and and i you know that and we have turkey you know this air to one the
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:54.440]  president becoming a neo ottoman emperor uh and who does obama
[01:18:54.440 --> 01:19:00.200]  use as his sounding board and his advisor for uh issues in the middle east
[01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:07.400]  he talks to air to one air to one who who's uh muslim cleric uh just said
[01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:11.240]  that it's it uh engage couples in turkey
[01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:15.000]  should not be walking around holding hands looks like turkey is going to go
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:18.440]  back to the ways of saudi arabia which just of course
[01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:21.960]  executed uh a major she had cleric and some
[01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:25.560]  minor she had clerics and that now we're supposed to
[01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:30.120]  be on the side of saudi arabia as they basically they they started this to get
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:34.120]  into a war with iran this is one case when the united states ought to just
[01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:38.280]  switch sides and say use saudi arabia you did it on
[01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:43.000]  9 11 with some of your friends and now you're trying to get us into a major
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:47.640]  shooting war with iran uh by the way uh we're retargeting our
[01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:50.360]  weapons they're not pointing it to ron anymore
[01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:54.920]  they're pointing at riyadh jeta and mecca
[01:19:54.920 --> 01:20:01.320]  well i tell you wane uh you can see operation chaos worldwide a specter
[01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:05.800]  doesn't exist in fantasy land but it exists in the real world
[01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:12.680]  with just all hades breaking loose and i got to say i supported the bundes and
[01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:16.920]  others and my reporters when they went when the feds had kicked all 35 other
[01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:19.880]  ranching families off they were the last family there
[01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:23.400]  harry reid was in a land swap for solar panels in one area
[01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:27.320]  this was going to be the environmental easement uh in the other
[01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:32.920]  and but now them going in when they're not wanted by the locals and taking over
[01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:38.040]  this area just the timing with obama and his gun control push
[01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:42.600]  and everything that's going on really really smells to me again i'm not
[01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:46.920]  saying they're bad i'm saying the whole thing with it now
[01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:50.200]  all over the news that oh my gosh white domestic terrorists are attacking
[01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:53.720]  you know all the quote black lives matter people saying you know go kill
[01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:57.880]  them send in the national guard i'm really concerned about them trying to
[01:20:57.880 --> 01:21:00.440]  kick off some type of civil unrest in this country
[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:04.840]  on the back of the gun control uh what's your take on that and do you have
[01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:08.600]  any ideas or strategies to try to uh navigate out of this then let's get
[01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:11.240]  into your article that we ran at info wars.com
[01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:16.680]  yesterday dealing with uh soros's top 10 hit list christians being number one
[01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:20.600]  well people can always be used by those who have agendas
[01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:26.680]  and remember occupy wall street soros of course did provide some money
[01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:31.400]  for occupy wall street but then we had as we started to see
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:36.280]  the occupy movement gel in new york and washington and la and other cities
[01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:40.040]  we had the fbi come out and they got caught uh
[01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:43.560]  because it was in their own documents that they were going to start
[01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:48.760]  using fbi snipers to pick off the leaders of the occupy movement who were
[01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:54.120]  speaking in these various uh city centers so there's a
[01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:59.480]  perfect example of how a guy like soros will cooperate with the government to
[01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:04.600]  basically surface the leadership uh for ulterior motives and uh
[01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:09.960]  and we saw look you can go back to the uh anti vietnam war protest when you
[01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:15.800]  you had like the sds occupying university offices rotc buildings on
[01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:19.560]  campuses and the later we found out a lot of these uh
[01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:24.680]  sds members were fbi informants so uh they were ratting out the
[01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:27.960]  the people who wanted to keep it nonviolent of course absolutely and
[01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:31.640]  then all i do all i do is i come out sunday and
[01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:35.640]  yesterday and i say i support the overall idea what the bunnies are doing
[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:37.960]  i know the feds are grabbing these mines and property
[01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:43.720]  as part of the deindustrialization shutdown program agenda 21 agenda 2030
[01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:47.400]  but the timing and where you're at please watch out for provocateurs
[01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:52.280]  watch out for infiltrators please and i told the feds please try to de-escalate
[01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:55.960]  don't play into the civil war plan that your foreign bosses want
[01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:59.640]  come on let's let's let's really come together here let's not be stupid
[01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:03.640]  i'm like a wartime broadcaster talking to both sides and not be idiots
[01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:07.720]  and then the response is people run from our reporters who are quote you know
[01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:09.960]  involved in all this and some of the prominent people
[01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:13.800]  well i don't even know their names and they go how dare alex jones say i'm a
[01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:17.640]  fed and and and aimin bundy's a fed and joe's like
[01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:20.920]  he never said that well it doesn't matter that's what we were told so you're bad
[01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:25.080]  i mean obviously who's telling him that i mean this is so textbook
[01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:29.080]  how they cut these people out how they manipulate them it's just so sad how
[01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:32.360]  they play him uh and it's just so i've i've been
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:37.000]  doing this for 20 plus years i told people that the hatari militia was
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:40.280]  being infiltrated and then six months later they busted them and
[01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:44.200]  brought them down and i worked to try to get the judge to drop the case and they
[01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:47.800]  did we blew that wide open and then i don't even get
[01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:51.480]  thanks because a lot of the folks involved in it aren't even smart enough
[01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:54.760]  i'm just being serious to get what happened to them i mean
[01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:58.360]  it's it's like nigerian emails i remember this has been going on for
[01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:02.600]  about 16 17 years where you get the email that you've you
[01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:05.800]  that prints ha boo boo or ha bb or whatever they say it is at the time
[01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:08.760]  literally has ten thousand dollars for you but
[01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:11.400]  he's reached out to you because he's heard you're a wonderful person
[01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:15.400]  these are the target women and that if you give them ten thousand dollars he
[01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:19.320]  will give you one million next week you give them the ten thousand dollars he
[01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:22.760]  goes oh the prince may be able to speak to you on the phone sorry
[01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:27.000]  he's been arrested by king agoo goo or whatever they make up i mean it's
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.200]  literally ridiculous you look it up if you don't even exist
[01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:34.280]  and then you're already in for ten grand con so you don't admit it
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:38.120]  and you just finally to talk to prince of booboo or a bb or whatever the name is
[01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:41.480]  you want to believe you've won the lottery well you start telling friends
[01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:44.120]  and family do not give them more money it's not
[01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:47.720]  real they go shut up you're just jealous i got that i'm about to get five
[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:52.680]  million now and i give them another 20 grand and you go no it's not real
[01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:56.760]  it's the scam and even when they give them the next round of money
[01:24:56.760 --> 01:25:01.160]  i've known three people that did this they will never talk to me again
[01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:05.640]  they will not admit they were wrong they will not admit they got conned
[01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:09.480]  just like obama voters or whatever on the free health care of obama care and
[01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:13.560]  they double triple prices and there was literally
[01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:18.120]  a talk show host i knew who i heard on air one day
[01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:21.240]  i thought it was a joke when i heard this is like 12 13 years ago i was about 14
[01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:24.360]  years ago announcing that he had been contacted by
[01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:28.520]  nigerian prince that wanted to fund his show and i called him and i said it's
[01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:31.880]  not real and he literally went on air and said i was
[01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:36.040]  jealous trying to stop it and then later said i jinxed the deal
[01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:40.200]  with the prince i mean it's the same thing i'm like look out for feds
[01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:43.880]  they'll say i'm bad they'll say you know violence is good whatever
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:48.760]  they'll try to escalate please watch out and then that means i said they're feds
[01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:54.280]  i mean it's it's just so hard to deal with this psychology and quite frankly
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:59.560]  went very very sad well yeah i mean this is a
[01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:02.840]  psychological warfare after all that's going on and
[01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:06.680]  unfortunately we see a lot of the the media
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:10.680]  is for example nbc news is not even reporting
[01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:16.200]  that these gangs of jihadi gangbangers are in fact from north african and
[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:19.160]  middle east primarily they're just saying they were
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:22.840]  young german men well first of all they're not german
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:26.600]  and second of all they don't just lie they don't just lie they scapegoat
[01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:29.160]  germans you know those germans they're really bad rapists
[01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:32.360]  let's repopulate europe with radical muslims they don't rape women
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:35.800]  yeah they're trying maybe they'll blame germans for beheading 47 people
[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:39.080]  in saudi arabia sunday i'm sorry because you hear about the germans what they
[01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:43.320]  did in saudi arabia right and the nbc and the soros
[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:47.000]  linked media is trying to say they're trying to see what happened in germany
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:50.760]  is just part of the war on women and has nothing to do with that these are
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:53.800]  jihadist gangbangers that the soros people
[01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:58.440]  basically welcomed into europe uh with all kinds of propaganda help and
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:01.320]  financial help exactly there's your headline
[01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:04.600]  feminist recycle radical muslim rapes to demonize men
[01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:08.760]  there's that's the sick what is the sick leftist
[01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:11.800]  alignment with radical islam because both of you and i were against the clash
[01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:14.680]  of civilizations we were against all these invasions you've been to libya
[01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:17.800]  you've been to syria you've been in daring you know coverage when you're
[01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:21.400]  getting i know shot at uh you know and bombs are going off i mean you're a
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:25.880]  real war correspondent and and you know you're not against muslims but my god
[01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:29.560]  we don't have to take all their 18 year old jihadists they got their butts kicked
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:33.720]  in syria to come rape our women and then have gloria steinham tell us we did it
[01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:37.400]  no you which we didn't do it western men treat women the best
[01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:42.760]  you which well it's it's funny in the city of cologne where some of these
[01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:46.600]  muslim gang rapes took place the mayor was attacked
[01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:49.560]  by a so-called right winger wielding a knife
[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:53.720]  they said that he got her in the neck and she's a basically a member of the
[01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:57.960]  social democratic green party alliance she was welcoming
[01:27:57.960 --> 01:28:02.600]  these migrants into germany and now she's bemoaning the fact that they were
[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:07.400]  raping uh german women on the streets of her city and in cologne or kuhn as it
[01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:11.320]  is exactly and we've showed the clips
[01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:15.720]  two of the green party leaders in germany have openly said it's good that
[01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:18.920]  whites are going to be gotten rid of germans or bad these are germans
[01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:22.680]  thank god we're herning into islam well why don't they move to saudi arabia then
[01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:27.320]  and these women can squat in a you know in a slave pit go ahead sorry
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:31.160]  well yeah so we had of course the soros gang
[01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:36.120]  which really runs the european union uh the european union is basically a
[01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:38.680]  contrivance for people like soros and his
[01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:42.680]  banker friends uh you know they put pressure on all these members of the
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:46.040]  u you got to take in so many of these refugees
[01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:49.320]  so-called refugees when we know that erdogan and turkey
[01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:54.520]  was pipelining uh these basically young men and then the sali said oh we'll
[01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:58.680]  help we'll help uh fund the building of 200 mosques
[01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:02.200]  in in germany of course he's a little unbelievable bobbas mosques
[01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:05.400]  uh they don't intend to go anywhere anytime soon because
[01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:09.320]  the salis want to build mosques for them and king salman who now wants to get in
[01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:13.160]  a war with iran uh he was the governor riyadh i exposed
[01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:18.280]  him he was one of the guys that paid money and paid for airplane tickets and
[01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:22.840]  hotel uh bills for these uh hijackers what came

[01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:30.600]  and then it came back to this country so he his fingerprints are all over the
[01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:33.960]  nine i agree stay there stay there let's talk about the huge
[01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:37.240]  sunni shia civil war that's now raging across africa

[01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:38.040]  jones
[01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:43.160]  we're brought up to believe that the last generation
[01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:46.680]  went through the incredible times that the last generation fought the big wars
[01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:49.640]  that the last generation somehow lives in a more exciting
[01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:53.480]  reality than we do i think that happens every generation in every
[01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:59.880]  culture throughout civilization's history but in the modern world
[01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:04.920]  people at a subconscious level almost believe entertainment and tv is real
[01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:09.480]  they believe reality tv is real it's some of the fakest television out there
[01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:13.720]  up until the time i was about four i thought that the world was black and
[01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:18.280]  white when movies were black and white
[01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:21.320]  and then finally i was sitting there watching gilligan's island one day
[01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:27.640]  and it was color my dad said no son it's film the world was always color
[01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:31.560]  but the first season of gilligan's island was shot in black and white
[01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:37.480]  a color film with technicolor got cheaper by the second season
[01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:40.920]  and then he explained to me about film cameras and he had film cameras and
[01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:44.600]  was in the photography then with my mother
[01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:48.440]  and he went and shot some fun home movies
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:52.360]  but i liken it to that people's perspective it's like
[01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:55.480]  back then the world was black and white back then the world was different
[01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:59.400]  now we're in a different world we are lined up to have wars
[01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:04.120]  much bigger than world war two the stock market i don't know when it's gonna die
[01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:07.800]  but it's all based on total fraud it can't go on forever and it's been plunged
[01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:11.160]  in 200 300 400 points friday monday and today i mean
[01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:14.040]  where is it right now we can put it on screen i hope it goes back up even though
[01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:19.000]  it's a fiat and pure garbage i'm not here cheerleading for it to fall
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:22.760]  i mean i got a family i just want good medicine
[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:26.920]  private property a right to be free a right to be a father
[01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:30.280]  the system's trying to undermine that
[01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:34.600]  we're being captured we're being enslaved we're going into a system of
[01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:38.280]  conquest and david night is riding shotgun with us back at the info wars
[01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:41.240]  news center i got an interview with louis
[01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:44.280]  ferrican and he doesn't do a lot of interviews folks
[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:48.600]  especially with outside media and i got there and what i thought was the case
[01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:53.080]  i mean they're all daily listeners louis ferrican listens to the show
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:56.840]  basically all the time you know every few days
[01:35:56.840 --> 01:36:00.200]  they had a computer just turn on and my show was playing
[01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:04.280]  i mean it was like it was it was over the top
[01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:07.640]  um people say well louis ferrican he says kill the police well
[01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:10.360]  he said if they shoot us in the back we should you know go after the officers
[01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:12.600]  did it and it's in senior area we talk about an interview
[01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:16.680]  doesn't mean i agree with everything he says but it's about opening a dialogue
[01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:20.520]  and if we get louis ferrican which he's already doing calling for cooler heads
[01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:25.080]  to prevail and not to buy this george soros civil war
[01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:29.160]  it's going to be a big big deal and the fact that
[01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:33.800]  a william benny's a listener a matt drudge is a listener
[01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:37.080]  donald trump's crew are listeners trumps familiar with the show for years
[01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:41.080]  wouldn't call him a listener um the fact that so many prominent people
[01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:44.920]  generals you name it it's not about alex jones
[01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:48.600]  it's about the fact that we've got a lot more things in common than we've got
[01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:52.600]  indifference in the new world order did a really good
[01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:56.120]  job in the 80s and 90s going in taking over militias
[01:36:56.120 --> 01:36:59.560]  leading a lot of them making them anti-government
[01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:04.120]  uh making them all paranoid and hiding out so they could be controlled
[01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:07.320]  to create a narrative like there's the militias creeping around to get you
[01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:11.000]  when they're as constitutional as george washington and should be out in the
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.880]  open doing open carries like we did with the texas land
[01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:19.080]  commissioner jerry paterson last year with 50 hundred people they hated that
[01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:22.600]  and they voted out those illegal laws after that
[01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:25.480]  and we go out and marshal guns you know openly when the police say they're
[01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:32.440]  going to arrest us i mean we do civil disobedience folks but
[01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:37.240]  we smile at the police while we do it and they smile back at us
[01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:40.280]  there's a few bad ones a few punks but i mean
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:43.640]  the globalists want to trick us to kill each other i don't want to hurt black
[01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:46.680]  people they don't want to hurt me on average if they can be wound up and
[01:37:46.680 --> 01:37:50.120]  tricked by george soros they are and they're going to be set up and i mean
[01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:53.800]  ferrican talked about how obama was sent to set black people up and
[01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:59.960]  about you know just the whole agenda it was unprecedented and i i want to put
[01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:03.000]  out the whole two hour interview but something this hot can't wait you know
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:06.520]  last night i was at dinner with ferrican they were wanting to put it out quicker
[01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:09.000]  so we're going to go meet with them today before i leave and i guess we're just
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:12.520]  going to i guess they're probably right well we'll talk to them at least take a
[01:38:12.520 --> 01:38:15.640]  week though to get all the clips really good coordinate and promote it with a
[01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:19.000]  few promo clips and things but we'll just put the whole thing out
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:22.520]  into end i wanted to do the interview where we
[01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:25.480]  you talk about things historical and play clips gonna make a documentary and
[01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:28.440]  we'll do that down the road but i want to be the guy
[01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:31.400]  that gets the big interview that nobody else can get
[01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:34.280]  with the donald trump but he does interviews with the mad rudge with the
[01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:37.880]  lewis ferrican uh with the day that i joined us tomorrow
[01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:41.880]  just to get people outside of the box going back to wane madston here in a
[01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:44.760]  moment rodent shotgun with us a little bit in the next hour
[01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:47.640]  lane's got some big reports he wants to go do here in the near future that i'm
[01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:49.720]  not going to mention on air but they're big
[01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:52.760]  i'm looking at funding to decide whether we can do it
[01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:56.520]  because he does do things on a shoestring budget but it still taxes us but i
[01:38:56.520 --> 01:38:59.320]  think i'm gonna probably send him on his next mission if we can
[01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:02.680]  really confirm he's gonna be able to do the things we're looking at doing
[01:39:02.680 --> 01:39:08.280]  in europe and in england but that's why it's more important than ever
[01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:12.520]  that you buy the books you buy the videos you buy the hillaryford prison t-shirts
[01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:15.800]  that are selling out in his limited edition when they're gone they're gone

[01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:15.240]  being in the middle of info wars for three plus years now david
[01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:19.560]  watching everything we've warned of unfolding we don't i know enjoy the
[01:42:19.560 --> 01:42:23.080]  fact we've been proven right i am horrified
[01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:27.480]  that we've been dead on except for it being worse than we thought i mean i am
[01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:32.040]  horrified i didn't get giddy when another high-level
[01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:35.560]  source told me that no obama is a radical wahhabist
[01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:38.680]  and prays to mecca in the white house and hates america
[01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:44.040]  and wants to bring america down uh i i didn't think oh i've got a big story oh
[01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:49.400]  this is great i got physically nauseous literally
[01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:54.680]  when i got in my car later shook some almost had to pull over and throw up
[01:42:54.680 --> 01:42:58.360]  because of the sadness of the deceptions the lies
[01:42:58.360 --> 01:43:03.400]  what's coming next i mean i i i just
[01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:08.200]  the danger of the position we're in the responsibility we have
[01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:11.880]  you know it's just good people've laid down so now
[01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:16.200]  every weirdo crazy's taken over because they have an appetite to dominate us
[01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:19.000]  uh david night then we're going to go back to wane madson
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:22.360]  yeah alex you know when you're what you're saying about uh lewis farrakhan i
[01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:25.240]  haven't seen that interview but when you're things that you're saying sounds
[01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:28.680]  very much like what we've heard from larry pinkney who used to be with the
[01:43:28.680 --> 01:43:31.080]  old black panthers he said they weren't a threat
[01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:34.600]  to the government as long as they stayed within the black community
[01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:37.960]  once they started reaching out and saying you know what this is a problem we
[01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:40.920]  all need to come together with that's when they came after them with agent
[01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:44.920]  provocateurs uh shut them down same thing the way farrakhan said
[01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:48.040]  because he's now doing that that's going to rub you spring up such good points
[01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:51.480]  he said at dinner for three hours he even let us record some of it he's looking
[01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:54.280]  for the whole thing but i forgot to record till i asked halfway through
[01:43:54.280 --> 01:43:57.400]  he said they're coming to kill me because i want to bring people together
[01:43:57.400 --> 01:44:01.720]  and i'm gonna you're absolutely right go ahead same thing with malcolm x
[01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:05.720]  that's what happened with malcolm x he stopped looking just within the black
[01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:09.640]  community he started to realize hey this is a much larger issue number one
[01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:12.840]  number two as we've pointed out many times
[01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:16.200]  everyone needs to come together to to solve this problem white people need
[01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:19.400]  to understand they're next on the list and it's already happening to white
[01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:22.920]  people in a large degree they don't have the kind of
[01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:26.520]  close community that the black people do or that awareness that hyper awareness
[01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:29.720]  of the oppression but yeah it's coming to everybody and the black people need
[01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:32.280]  to understand they're not going to be able to turn this back
[01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:36.440]  unless the white community in general understands that it's their problem too
[01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:40.120]  so that's the the part about black lives matter that george soros put in that
[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:43.640]  is so dangerous because it compartmentalizes people it breaks them
[01:44:43.640 --> 01:44:46.360]  into little groups that can't do anything that's why we need to have
[01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:51.800]  the new york city big city democrat mafia model the republicans play it too
[01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:55.480]  but i mean i i mean i literally grew up with christian
[01:44:55.480 --> 01:44:58.520]  somewhat conservative parents but they were very liberal when it came to civil
[01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:01.800]  rights my grandfather would come back from world war two whole family were
[01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:07.320]  democrats ran for county office one on an eisenhower ticket
[01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:12.200]  of uh ending you know uh jim crow and all the rest of it
[01:45:12.200 --> 01:45:17.320]  and and so you know i grew up never hearing racist comments never here in
[01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:21.640]  fact have a hearing white guilt that that we've been oppressive and bad need to
[01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:24.680]  build people up and and so that's why then here the
[01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:28.440]  leftist claim and i'm this racist makes me so angry but then it wasn't till i got
[01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:32.040]  around democrats and abortion people behind the scenes in new york and
[01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:36.360]  chicago that the upper class black people and whites
[01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:39.800]  literally get off on keeping black people down and
[01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:42.520]  feeding on them and watching them kill each other it's sick
[01:45:42.520 --> 01:45:46.440]  it's disgusting and they're filth they are filth
[01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:49.560]  it's just like a radical feminist blaming germans for all the raping
[01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:52.760]  once they're darling radical muslims they brought in sorry david go ahead oh
[01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:55.880]  yeah and we just had a quote that the crew put up there from malcolm x i'm
[01:45:55.880 --> 01:45:59.000]  paraphrasing and goes if you're not careful the media is going to have you
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:02.600]  hating the people who were oppressed and loving the oppressors and that's
[01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:08.280]  exactly right what happened in uh in in the german situation in cologne
[01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:12.680]  they had video footage of this and they knew that this wasn't germans
[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:15.720]  you could see very clearly who was doing this they withheld that information
[01:46:15.720 --> 01:46:17.960]  that's why people were saying wait a minute you're covering this up they
[01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:21.720]  withheld it for several days before it eventually made its way out the truth
[01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:26.360]  eventually does come out but they wanted to hide that because they've got
[01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:29.960]  an agenda they realize that they can bring new people in
[01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:34.040]  bring people in from areas that are our government the european government

[01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:03.800]  wane thank you for writing shotgun and giving commentary today let's get into
[01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:07.240]  the larger destabilization because it's they're not just attacking us
[01:47:07.240 --> 01:47:10.280]  they're using the crisis to attack muslims as well
[01:47:10.280 --> 01:47:13.880]  destabilizing them if we think we've got refugees now
[01:47:13.880 --> 01:47:18.680]  we already have a major civil war between shia suny kicked off by the cia
[01:47:18.680 --> 01:47:23.080]  on record quarterback by a Saudi arabia you're the expert on this but in the
[01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:26.920]  middle east scores of times what's happening right now wane madson
[01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:31.960]  well what's happening is that the turks and the Saudis are forming an alliance
[01:47:31.960 --> 01:47:35.640]  and the turks which were always known they were always known as
[01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:39.800]  secular since the days of kamal out of turk the founder of the turkish
[01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:43.640]  republic after the fall of the ottomans we're seeing this alliance of
[01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:48.760]  wahhabist muslim brotherhood alliance come into play here and
[01:47:48.760 --> 01:47:54.920]  and and right now you've got the the saucy soros was recently in
[01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:58.440]  istanbul where he met with erdogan a turkish president
[01:47:58.440 --> 01:48:05.480]  obama's middle east council mr erdogan the neo sultan
[01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:11.240]  of turkey and he he doesn't try to stage any demonstrations against erdogan
[01:48:11.240 --> 01:48:16.360]  even though erdogan is trying to institute sharia law in turkey
[01:48:16.360 --> 01:48:21.800]  it's it's little baby steps now and and what we saw what is so what is
[01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:25.800]  soros doing ukraine for example he overthrew a democratically elected
[01:48:25.800 --> 01:48:31.000]  president and now we've got neo-nazi battalions fighting alongside
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:35.560]  chechen muslim terrorists fresh from the battlefield in syria
[01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:39.640]  fighting a russian speaking people in eastern ukraine
[01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:44.840]  and and under the under the protective umbrella of the cia and nato
[01:48:44.840 --> 01:48:48.760]  unbelievable this is what soros does uh soros
[01:48:48.760 --> 01:48:53.640]  look the reason that there's a reason why the last james bond movie still
[01:48:53.640 --> 01:48:58.840]  has the it's it's not specter the the villain
[01:48:58.840 --> 01:49:02.440]  is working for a group called quantum it's no mistake
[01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:06.520]  that soros's hedge fund is called quantum the the villain
[01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:12.120]  uh blow felt in in the last bond movie is is is quantum
[01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:15.240]  basically bringing in all the past the last i guess
[01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:18.200]  this they're telling us it's soros they're rubbing our
[01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:21.960]  talking about soros yes because the british
[01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:26.760]  british establishment and mi6 which basically has approved every
[01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:31.800]  bond script since the first one they always remember what soros tried to do
[01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:36.040]  to the british pound in 1992 he tried to short it he tried to
[01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:39.720]  uh uh let me ask you this he's tried to drive down the pound he's tried to
[01:49:39.720 --> 01:49:43.480]  destroy the us why do our elites put up with him
[01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:46.760]  when he would butcher them if he could i mean this this guy's dangerous
[01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:51.960]  he's a multi he's a multinational octopus uh he's got so many people
[01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:55.560]  uh he looked he bought human rights watch he gave them
[01:49:55.560 --> 01:50:00.360]  uh a hundred million dollars he's given massive amounts of money to amnesty
[01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:03.240]  international so what he's done is he's bought up
[01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:07.960]  the NGO community the the the groups i used to work with these groups i won't
[01:50:07.960 --> 01:50:11.160]  have anything to do with them anymore because i see
[01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:15.080]  that they play into this propaganda uh they they help
[01:50:15.080 --> 01:50:19.080]  soros bring down governments Assad is the bad guy
[01:50:19.080 --> 01:50:23.000]  but the what the jihadists in syria they're okay when a

[01:54:14.040 --> 01:54:18.280]  ladies and gentlemen this system is used our open form of government
[01:54:18.280 --> 01:54:22.200]  to infiltrate with hungry wolves that want to dominate
[01:54:22.200 --> 01:54:26.040]  they are attacking every sovereign nation every sovereign institution that is not
[01:54:26.040 --> 01:54:29.720]  pure evil they are allied with the scum
[01:54:29.720 --> 01:54:33.560]  of the earth and quite frankly people have the right to do
[01:54:33.560 --> 01:54:37.160]  whatever they want against this system because it's so lawless
[01:54:37.160 --> 01:54:40.760]  declaration of independence is in place but just because you have the right to
[01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:44.120]  do something doesn't mean you should do it
[01:54:44.120 --> 01:54:48.120]  and people better think long and hard about George Soros and the globalist
[01:54:48.120 --> 01:54:51.640]  that are going to laugh while people have shootouts out in the middle of
[01:54:51.640 --> 01:54:56.280]  nowhere over land rights issues we need to be in the info war
[01:54:56.280 --> 01:54:59.400]  exposing they're coming for our guns they're flooding us with radical
[01:54:59.400 --> 01:55:04.040]  jihadists that's what trumps having success exposing
[01:55:04.040 --> 01:55:08.120]  to the point that i have loose fur con on video
[01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:11.160]  we're going to release it very soon i'm going to go meet with them again today
[01:55:11.160 --> 01:55:14.840]  because we were conferring on when we want to put this out saying stop all
[01:55:14.840 --> 01:55:18.280]  Muslims coming into the u.s right now
[01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:24.280]  it's just over the top and that's fair con scared i'm scared i mean i mean
[01:55:24.280 --> 01:55:27.160]  folks you do not i'm telling you this is so real
[01:55:27.160 --> 01:55:31.000]  this is so over the top this is a setup this is how america dies this is the
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:36.040]  takeover this is the big war they want to start
[01:55:37.080 --> 01:55:42.840]  now imagine you got cut off by the break looking at this situation
[01:55:42.840 --> 01:55:46.680]  obama i think really is clearly trying to get people angry to do something
[01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:49.320]  stupid do you think they'll get away with a false
[01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:52.200]  flag blaming the patriots like Oklahoma city this time or
[01:55:52.200 --> 01:55:55.080]  what are you most concerned about i mean you've proven
[01:55:55.080 --> 01:55:58.680]  and i'm not kissing your your butt here but it's true that you have
[01:55:58.680 --> 01:56:01.880]  piercing understanding of their tricks and how they operate
[01:56:01.880 --> 01:56:05.480]  i mean are they doing well right now or is this all desperate floundering
[01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:08.520]  because their poll numbers are all in the toilet but they don't care they're
[01:56:08.520 --> 01:56:11.240]  just moving forward with with with craziness and then
[01:56:11.240 --> 01:56:14.840]  you know i'm no lionizer of the feds but
[01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:19.080]  the feds we talk to and what we see leaking the federal government itself
[01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:21.480]  appears to be completely freaked out about what's going on
[01:56:21.480 --> 01:56:25.080]  it looks like self-preservation may be kicking in here am i wrong
[01:56:25.080 --> 01:56:29.080]  no and i think uh the wiser heads will prevail here
[01:56:29.080 --> 01:56:32.760]  you know the government had a lot of egg on its face with
[01:56:32.760 --> 01:56:37.640]  uh waco ruby ridge and of course that happened under whose administration and
[01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:41.880]  we have to remember that was mr clinton says wife's running for president
[01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:46.120]  she's a lot closer by the way to soros than even obama is
[01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:50.040]  uh so i think i think there's going to be an attempt to
[01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:54.280]  tamp this one down because if there's another situation where there's a lot
[01:56:54.280 --> 01:56:59.080]  of bloodshed uh you know it's it's katie bar the door all
[01:56:59.080 --> 01:57:02.440]  bets are off and this is why i you know i think the
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:05.640]  trump phenomenon here is very interesting and i think
[01:57:05.640 --> 01:57:09.880]  he the sleeper issue here is is one that generally
[01:57:09.880 --> 01:57:13.000]  what he's talking about there's too much political correctness
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:18.440]  which talks gets into a wider issue of people trying to control public discourse
[01:57:18.440 --> 01:57:24.600]  i i i recently noted that my mom's family going back generations
[01:57:24.600 --> 01:57:28.360]  self-start the annual new year's mummer's parade in philadelphia
[01:57:28.360 --> 01:57:31.640]  well a guy just got suspended because he had a sign
[01:57:31.640 --> 01:57:37.160]  in the comic uh division and they always made fun of everything i remember
[01:57:37.160 --> 01:57:40.360]  seeing that when i was a kid the mummer's parade would make fun of
[01:57:40.360 --> 01:57:43.800]  all kinds of things he had a picture of bruce Jenner
[01:57:43.800 --> 01:57:49.560]  from the old weedy's box when he was an olympic olympic uh star and then they
[01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:53.560]  they had a picture of katelin Jenner on a box of fruit loops
[01:57:53.560 --> 01:57:59.000]  well yeah so even having fun now is illegal i mean it's just exactly in
[01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:02.840]  free speech big deal yeah so now now this guy's been banned
[01:58:02.840 --> 01:58:07.800]  for life from the mummer's parade his family probably also probably helped
[01:58:07.800 --> 01:58:11.000]  start it going back generations and now the mummers
[01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:14.200]  all even the even these spring band divisions have to undergo
[01:58:14.200 --> 01:58:18.200]  lgbt vlt whatever it's called sensitivity training
[01:58:18.200 --> 01:58:21.960]  now you know you take that and there was a there was a liberal arts school in
[01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:25.320]  pennsylvania the hall was banning banning the linch
[01:58:25.320 --> 01:58:28.920]  stay there i'm gonna come back wait wait wait stay there back in 70 seconds

[01:58:32.040 --> 01:58:35.880]  obama's gun grab speech that happened hours ago we got five clips of that
[01:58:35.880 --> 01:58:44.120]  the third hour straight ahead thank you for listening to gcn visit gcn live
[01:58:44.120 --> 01:58:49.000]  dot com today
[01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:52.920]  every year millions of americans are unknowingly letting government
[01:58:52.920 --> 01:58:57.960]  institutions and mega corporations steal billions of dollars of their money

[02:00:21.800 --> 02:00:27.000]  and i hope that judge ain't blind way madston way madstoneport.com
[02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.720]  and forewords.com reporter i cut off by the break
[02:00:29.720 --> 02:00:33.320]  we're gonna come up in the next segment play five clips from obama's gun grab
[02:00:33.320 --> 02:00:38.440]  when you got cut off getting into hardcore control of speech in america
[02:00:38.440 --> 02:00:43.560]  but we've only really seen uh under pullpots kameroos and kambodia maybe the
[02:00:43.560 --> 02:00:47.400]  nazis the soviets the malice i mean this is
[02:00:47.400 --> 02:00:53.800]  flaming tyranny flaming beyond a cult the control of language
[02:00:53.800 --> 02:00:58.680]  and then they've got so many followers that actually get off on conforming
[02:00:58.680 --> 02:01:03.240]  yeah and and we had yet another case recently at overland which is a very
[02:01:03.240 --> 02:01:06.440]  liberal school in ohio where where some of the
[02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:12.600]  students again mostly affluenza self-entitled rich white kids were
[02:01:12.600 --> 02:01:16.440]  objecting to the fact that they were serving general so's chicken and it
[02:01:16.440 --> 02:01:20.440]  wasn't made according to the chinese way well general
[02:01:20.440 --> 02:01:25.000]  so's chicken never came from china it was a contrivance
[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:29.640]  made up by chinese restaurants in the united states so not only these people
[02:01:29.640 --> 02:01:33.320]  being fascist when it comes to free speech
[02:01:33.320 --> 02:01:37.000]  they're stupid as well these that what happened in in in
[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:42.040]  pennsylvania with the lynch hall named after a former president of that school
[02:01:42.040 --> 02:01:48.280]  named lynch uh it was a benefactor uh they saw that means like lynching these
[02:01:48.280 --> 02:01:52.200]  these are what rich is the attorney general gonna close
[02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:55.800]  change her name i mean is her irish name evil
[02:01:55.800 --> 02:02:00.360]  right right yeah exactly how about getting rid of the tv show the jefferson's
[02:02:00.360 --> 02:02:03.560]  a lot of people want to get jefferson's name because he was a slave owner they
[02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:06.840]  want to get it off of things and even though he was trying to end slavery
[02:02:06.840 --> 02:02:11.000]  yeah i know but they started with this civil war thing and i i had a real bad
[02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:15.800]  feeling that that was not going to stop with a couple of statues
[02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:19.160]  and a couple of confederate flags that it was going to continue
[02:02:19.160 --> 02:02:22.440]  and i and by the way i want to say this about jefferson
[02:02:22.440 --> 02:02:26.600]  jefferson inherited people that were part of his family
[02:02:26.600 --> 02:02:29.480]  i say slavery didn't even exist because they were still people to begin with i'm
[02:02:29.480 --> 02:02:32.840]  not a slave even if you say i am and he had children
[02:02:32.840 --> 02:02:37.000]  that they say he was raping these women they loved him he actually i'd say went
[02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.640]  native and became basically the first black president
[02:02:39.640 --> 02:02:43.080]  loved black people tried to end slavery and they wouldn't let him do it
[02:02:43.080 --> 02:02:47.160]  in the first declaration of independence and the constitution so they demonized
[02:02:47.160 --> 02:02:51.720]  the first guy that tried to really end it and he said slavery's a great evil and
[02:02:51.720 --> 02:02:55.160]  will come back on us and then they sit there a lot of people and say
[02:02:55.160 --> 02:02:59.480]  thomas jefferson hated black people right i think there is an
[02:02:59.480 --> 02:03:03.240]  an active measure and it's funded a lot by these
[02:03:03.240 --> 02:03:06.920]  not just soros there's a lot of people like soros he's got a lot of money he's
[02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:10.840]  got a lot of exposure but there there is an attempt to reinvent history
[02:03:10.840 --> 02:03:14.440]  and we saw that in the old soviet union we saw that nazi germany
[02:03:14.440 --> 02:03:18.760]  how they tried to reinvent their their own past and i see that happening now
[02:03:18.760 --> 02:03:21.960]  hillary for example a couple weeks ago actually attacked
[02:03:21.960 --> 02:03:25.800]  a comedy club because they were making fun of her
[02:03:25.800 --> 02:03:29.800]  okay is this what we're going to look forward to and then now you know
[02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:33.800]  that means that means we've had a couple of comedians already
[02:03:33.800 --> 02:03:39.160]  complain about this and and they start to sound a lot like
[02:03:39.160 --> 02:03:43.240]  a lot like a trump when it comes to this political
[02:03:43.240 --> 02:03:47.320]  correctness i think this isn't a sleeper issue because when people
[02:03:47.320 --> 02:03:50.360]  feel like they're not they don't have the right to say
[02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:54.120]  what they want to say i mean it started with workplace being
[02:03:54.120 --> 02:03:57.880]  politically correct and i agree people are pissed they're tired of it
[02:03:57.880 --> 02:04:00.600]  absolutely and i think it's gonna we're seeing
[02:04:00.600 --> 02:04:04.280]  uh where i think it's an issue that is giving
[02:04:04.280 --> 02:04:08.040]  trump this continued bounce in the democratic uh
[02:04:08.040 --> 02:04:11.720]  i want to talk trump when we come back and get and also get uh david night
[02:04:11.720 --> 02:04:13.880]  to pop it here and play these clips from obama
[02:04:13.880 --> 02:04:18.600]  but separately when i make the america's first black president comment
[02:04:18.600 --> 02:04:22.360]  uh clinton's are known to be racist clinton's have no connection to black
[02:04:22.360 --> 02:04:25.400]  people he puts them off as he goes through once a year in harlem
[02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:28.600]  they claim he's the first black president that thomas jefferson had
[02:04:28.600 --> 02:04:32.360]  children with black women and preferred black people's company to whites at his
[02:04:32.360 --> 02:04:35.160]  home that's well known on record he wrote about it
[02:04:35.160 --> 02:04:38.520]  so if you want to say a white guy's the first black president it's the third
[02:04:38.520 --> 02:04:41.720]  president of the united states it's not bill clinton i mean doesn't thomas
[02:04:41.720 --> 02:04:44.760]  jefferson have a better claim than bill clinton
[02:04:44.760 --> 02:04:49.800]  oh i think so i mean i mean is clinton having
[02:04:49.800 --> 02:04:54.440]  children with black women well there was a story about arkansas
[02:04:54.440 --> 02:04:58.040]  so maybe he what maybe is like thomas jefferson will be right back folks in
[02:04:58.040 --> 02:05:01.640]  full wars dot com way message while president obama attempts to enact gun
[02:05:01.640 --> 02:05:05.400]  control via executive action a new gallup poll shows that only
[02:05:05.400 --> 02:05:09.240]  two percent of americans believe that guns or gun control
[02:05:09.240 --> 02:05:14.120]  are among the country's top problems gallup asked about one thousand americans
[02:05:14.120 --> 02:05:18.760]  in all fifty states what they thought the nation's top problems were in 2015
[02:05:18.760 --> 02:05:23.640]  and out of 23 problems mentioned by americans guns gun control ranked near
[02:05:23.640 --> 02:05:28.520]  the bottom at 19th in comparison 16 percent of americans said that the
[02:05:28.520 --> 02:05:33.080]  government was the nation's biggest issue 13 percent said the economy
[02:05:33.080 --> 02:05:37.000]  eight percent said unemployment and another eight said immigration
[02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:41.240]  but rather than working on these hot button issues both president obama
[02:05:41.240 --> 02:05:44.920]  and the mainstream media would rather focus on gun control
[02:05:44.920 --> 02:05:47.960]  with a president even stating that he wants to quote
[02:05:47.960 --> 02:05:52.440]  make gun control part of his legacy end quote according to cnn

[02:09:19.240 --> 02:09:22.280]  riding shotgun as i'm here on the road david knight will be hosting
[02:09:22.280 --> 02:09:26.440]  himself the fourth hour today as i prepare to
[02:09:26.440 --> 02:09:30.600]  travel back to austin david knight is with us
[02:09:30.600 --> 02:09:33.880]  i wanted to briefly bring david knight and then give him a break until
[02:09:33.880 --> 02:09:36.600]  joe biggs comes up and you know i'm sure have some comments for that at the
[02:09:36.600 --> 02:09:39.960]  bottom of the hour then i want to get to these other clips but
[02:09:39.960 --> 02:09:46.280]  here is a clip from harry reid i want to get wane's take on this as well
[02:09:46.280 --> 02:09:51.640]  obviously after david knight and others marching up david wasn't armed the fed
[02:09:51.640 --> 02:09:54.200]  said we're going to shoot you if you cross the line to take the money's cattle
[02:09:54.200 --> 02:09:57.560]  back and it's incredible footage i think the
[02:09:57.560 --> 02:10:02.120]  headline is historic footage feds to rendered citizens
[02:10:02.120 --> 02:10:05.800]  and they lower their guns and don't do it because they're special ops people that
[02:10:05.800 --> 02:10:08.280]  feds actually brought in they're like i'm not going to shoot americans waving
[02:10:08.280 --> 02:10:12.760]  american flags with cowboy hats on over cattle we just stole from them i mean
[02:10:12.760 --> 02:10:16.040]  so they're not our enemies is my point if a shooting war starts that's the way it
[02:10:16.040 --> 02:10:19.480]  is but i i mean we're really losers if we let this
[02:10:19.480 --> 02:10:25.320]  happen um and then i just question
[02:10:26.280 --> 02:10:30.600]  the kind of black hole that is people just showing up claiming that they speak
[02:10:30.600 --> 02:10:33.480]  for everybody and running around claiming that i'm saying the bun these
[02:10:33.480 --> 02:10:37.320]  are feds when i'm not boy isn't that funny how that works
[02:10:37.320 --> 02:10:43.160]  people speak for you and msnbc says i'm deeply racist too you know they
[02:10:43.160 --> 02:10:46.920]  and that giant wasp was under the u n building it's not true folks
[02:10:46.920 --> 02:10:50.600]  this is the dis info going on but here's that clip we'll get david's take on
[02:10:50.600 --> 02:10:55.400]  that here it is i keep in mind what happened up there
[02:10:55.400 --> 02:11:01.160]  there were hundreds hundreds of people from around the country that came there
[02:11:01.160 --> 02:11:06.360]  they had sniper rifles on the freeway they had assault weapons they had
[02:11:06.360 --> 02:11:09.400]  automatic weapons and as the one of the former
[02:11:09.400 --> 02:11:12.920]  sheriffs from arizona said and we had children and women lined up because
[02:11:12.920 --> 02:11:16.600]  what if anybody got hurt we want to make sure they got hurt first
[02:11:16.600 --> 02:11:19.720]  because we want the federal government hurting women and children
[02:11:19.720 --> 02:11:23.480]  this is the deal and it's not a good one so these people
[02:11:23.480 --> 02:11:27.560]  who hold themselves out to be patriots are not
[02:11:27.560 --> 02:11:31.800]  they're nothing more than domestic terrorists and i think that we are a
[02:11:31.800 --> 02:11:34.280]  country that people should follow the law
[02:11:34.280 --> 02:11:38.040]  and what went up in mesquite is not very good i repeat
[02:11:38.040 --> 02:11:41.960]  all right and again i told david to take a break till he came back he's already
[02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:44.200]  out of the studio so we'll get his take on this later but
[02:11:44.200 --> 02:11:50.520]  here's cnn then yesterday calling the three bundy sons and the people
[02:11:50.520 --> 02:11:54.200]  they're in oregon it was just taken over this federal
[02:11:54.200 --> 02:11:57.560]  little warehouse little barn that nobody's in and are
[02:11:57.560 --> 02:12:01.560]  wanting to draw attention to what's happening on the cause
[02:12:01.560 --> 02:12:05.880]  and i know the bunnies prayed and folks were ready to die back at their ranch
[02:12:05.880 --> 02:12:09.160]  well now they're here i guess ready to do that and i'm just saying this is
[02:12:09.160 --> 02:12:13.080]  really bad timing and you know that's america i got my first amendment
[02:12:13.080 --> 02:12:16.200]  and i said watch out for feds the infiltrator pull something which is a
[02:12:16.200 --> 02:12:19.960]  no-brainer like the sun coming up and boy people said
[02:12:19.960 --> 02:12:24.600]  alex is saying the bunnies are fans i'll really produce that clip oh but don't
[02:12:24.600 --> 02:12:27.960]  suspect who makes stuff up don't suspect who does that
[02:12:27.960 --> 02:12:31.240]  tries to cut you off from the main patriot leader support oh don't
[02:12:31.240 --> 02:12:35.880]  and oh no don't don't don't question that of course oh no
[02:12:35.880 --> 02:12:39.240]  if we're this stupid we deserve what happens to us
[02:12:39.240 --> 02:12:42.840]  wane madson again getting back into this briefly they want civil unrest
[02:12:42.840 --> 02:12:46.120]  they're funding the black lives matter movement has a lot of legitimate beefs
[02:12:46.120 --> 02:12:49.880]  but their answers federalized police they're bringing in these new
[02:12:49.880 --> 02:12:54.520]  un nodes under a strong city initiative
[02:12:54.520 --> 02:12:58.440]  to basically federalize everything i mean boy i tell you this is quite a
[02:12:58.440 --> 02:13:01.240]  constellation of tyranny we're witnessing
[02:13:01.240 --> 02:13:04.360]  yeah it's always interesting to hear harry reid
[02:13:04.360 --> 02:13:07.880]  you know harry reid is a product that had lost vegas mob
[02:13:07.880 --> 02:13:12.280]  here here's a guy and if people think that he uh almost put his eye out because
[02:13:12.280 --> 02:13:16.680]  of a malfunctioning exercise machine you know i got a bridge in brooklyn
[02:13:16.680 --> 02:13:21.960]  and selam this guy got got like a 25 million dollar markup set
[02:13:21.960 --> 02:13:26.440]  aside to take the old federal post office building in vegas and
[02:13:26.440 --> 02:13:30.920]  turned it into a mob museum can you imagine a museum honoring
[02:13:30.920 --> 02:13:35.240]  the mafia buggy seagull and mayer lansky you know we know
[02:13:35.240 --> 02:13:39.080]  we know who's been buttering harry reid's
[02:13:39.080 --> 02:13:45.000]  bread for years and i mean it's nevada of course uh it's a wide
[02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:49.000]  open state but uh you know you get what you pay for people
[02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:52.040]  paid for harry reid and they got what they expected they got a
[02:13:52.040 --> 02:13:57.160]  they got a mobbed up senator to help run a mobbed up state
[02:13:57.160 --> 02:14:00.040]  and people finally said no to him which we admire
[02:14:00.040 --> 02:14:03.800]  uh what is the word from your investigative repertoire
[02:14:03.800 --> 02:14:09.400]  of what really happened to read well i i talked to people and you know of
[02:14:09.400 --> 02:14:12.760]  course this happened while he was uh out in nevada
[02:14:12.760 --> 02:14:16.920]  that he uh he may have gotten into a you know a big fist fight with
[02:14:16.920 --> 02:14:20.680]  somebody some of somebody sent him a message he he didn't have the right
[02:14:20.680 --> 02:14:23.720]  answer as we used to say uh somebody didn't have the right
[02:14:23.720 --> 02:14:27.480]  answer up in philadelphia you know they got they got a black guy
[02:14:27.480 --> 02:14:31.560]  uh and that's not i think that's probably what happened i think the guy's
[02:14:31.560 --> 02:14:35.960]  so mobbed up he got a little like donnie briscoe action going on
[02:14:35.960 --> 02:14:40.520]  there uh but uh uh you know what was the word on
[02:14:40.520 --> 02:14:43.560]  bush you know obviously he kept falling down and getting all beaten up
[02:14:43.560 --> 02:14:47.720]  claiming he choked on a pretzel well that that's interesting the pretzel thing
[02:14:47.720 --> 02:14:51.560]  and i i had that confirmed later by somebody pretty high up
[02:14:51.560 --> 02:14:55.240]  uh in in government uh he actually was drunk
[02:14:55.240 --> 02:14:58.360]  he was watching a football game he was drinking jim beam
[02:14:58.360 --> 02:15:02.360]  and chasing it with uh uh loan star beer
[02:15:02.360 --> 02:15:05.320]  now there's a guy that wasn't supposed to be drinking anymore we you know
[02:15:05.320 --> 02:15:08.520]  recovering out and why is he drinking crap beer and drinking crap whiskey
[02:15:08.520 --> 02:15:12.040]  that's i mean with all that money he ought to be drinking
[02:15:12.040 --> 02:15:15.880]  well he liked it it was i guess something he had been doing
[02:15:15.880 --> 02:15:20.040]  his whole life or you know his he and his buddies used to do it when they were
[02:15:20.040 --> 02:15:25.080]  in the fraternity but yeah he passed out he hit the coffee table
[02:15:25.080 --> 02:15:28.840]  and then in the residential quarters of the white house uh
[02:15:28.840 --> 02:15:32.600]  probably not the first time it's remember we had we had bill clinton used to
[02:15:32.600 --> 02:15:36.440]  walk out with marx on his forehead then at one time he said he walked into a
[02:15:36.440 --> 02:15:39.000]  door actually he walked into an ashtray that had been
[02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:42.840]  thrown at him by illy clinton i got that from secret service
[02:15:42.840 --> 02:15:46.680]  agents uh presidential security let me raise this
[02:15:46.680 --> 02:15:49.400]  obviously you've got a lot of secret service connections and stuff i think
[02:15:49.400 --> 02:15:52.040]  they're persecuting him because they know how close they are the president
[02:15:52.040 --> 02:15:56.840]  obviously no agency's perfect but one drunk driving deal some hookers i mean
[02:15:56.840 --> 02:16:00.520]  big deal compared to other agencies i i think get it from high level sources
[02:16:00.520 --> 02:16:03.800]  that obama is just whacked out beyond belief and is actually i mean we talk
[02:16:03.800 --> 02:16:07.240]  about earlier practicing muslim do you have any intel on that
[02:16:07.240 --> 02:16:11.240]  well i what i understand is and i think the biggest probably secret services
[02:16:11.240 --> 02:16:14.520]  when they put him part of made him part of homeland security they should have
[02:16:14.520 --> 02:16:18.360]  left them separate as part of the treasury department because it was always
[02:16:18.360 --> 02:16:22.280]  that is free to core now they're like part of that big
[02:16:22.280 --> 02:16:26.440]  you know american version of the kgb a huge bureaucracy
[02:16:26.440 --> 02:16:33.080]  but i i've what i've heard is that obama is incredibly disengaged from a lot of
[02:16:33.080 --> 02:16:40.040]  day to day events uh when he does uh get on the internet or uses his uh
[02:16:40.040 --> 02:16:45.160]  you know classified secure blackberry he's doing a lot of vanity searches to
[02:16:45.160 --> 02:16:50.280]  see what people are saying about him uh how the press is covering him but other
[02:16:50.280 --> 02:16:55.160]  than that i understand espn is found uh on tv more
[02:16:55.160 --> 02:16:59.560]  often in the private quarters of the white house than you know
[02:16:59.560 --> 02:17:04.440]  c as cnn or msnbc well he admits that and i mean what about him like being on
[02:17:04.440 --> 02:17:08.840]  reality tv shows and saying i'm going to watch star wars this weekend
[02:17:08.840 --> 02:17:11.960]  i mean while all these wars are going on i mean even liberals
[02:17:11.960 --> 02:17:14.840]  like david spader coming out and saying hey you need to be on reality tv a little
[02:17:14.840 --> 02:17:17.960]  bit less we got five clips here i want to start going to him i i didn't get the
[02:17:17.960 --> 02:17:21.320]  list guys so i'll just i'll just go to the first uh clip
[02:17:21.320 --> 02:17:24.520]  uh let's play this first clip from obama's press conference earlier
[02:17:24.520 --> 02:17:29.640]  where he fake cried i mean talk about going all out to get our guns
[02:17:29.640 --> 02:17:33.000]  that's trying to mobilize the hordes of his disenfranchised
[02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:37.960]  idiot supporters to help complete our journey to slavery here it is
[02:17:37.960 --> 02:17:43.080]  anybody in the business of selling firearms must get a license and conduct
[02:17:43.080 --> 02:17:57.880]  background checks or be subject to criminal prosecutions
[02:17:57.880 --> 02:18:00.200]  that means transferring guns to your family doesn't matter whether you're
[02:18:00.200 --> 02:18:04.680]  doing it over the internet or at a national registration
[02:18:04.680 --> 02:18:10.840]  it's not where you do it but what you do by where you do it what you do
[02:18:10.840 --> 02:18:14.600]  okay so that's a national registration database that's the next step to taking
[02:18:14.600 --> 02:18:17.000]  our guns they admit it we have the austin protein
[02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:20.040]  mayor saying once we register we confiscate and laugh
[02:18:20.040 --> 02:18:23.400]  so i mean they tell us they're coming period this is the godwood secret
[02:18:23.400 --> 02:18:26.120]  service guardian uh let's go ahead and go to the next
[02:18:26.120 --> 02:18:29.560]  clip this is uh expanding background checks that means putting
[02:18:29.560 --> 02:18:36.040]  psychologicals bs no fly list just made up crap no judge no jury here it is
[02:18:36.040 --> 02:18:39.480]  we're also expanding background checks to cover violent criminals
[02:18:39.480 --> 02:18:43.320]  who try to buy some of the most dangerous firearms by hiding behind trusts
[02:18:43.320 --> 02:18:47.240]  and corporations unless there's Syrian refugees
[02:18:47.240 --> 02:18:50.040]  you can't buy through it's a buy the gun then put it to trust you know we're
[02:18:50.040 --> 02:18:53.240]  also taking trust to make the background checks system
[02:18:53.240 --> 02:18:56.520]  more efficient like the thousands of Syrian refugees you just let go
[02:18:56.520 --> 02:19:00.920]  jim combi and the fbi or the airfly with 150 people from Mexico you just let go
[02:19:00.920 --> 02:19:04.360]  through customs brandon and uh afk
[02:19:04.360 --> 02:19:08.120]  a tf you drug addict we're gonna hire more folks to process applications

[02:24:15.160 --> 02:24:18.280]  anyone selling a firearm must get a license that means transferring that
[02:24:18.280 --> 02:24:22.440]  means giving of 22 to your grandson that's to track all guns
[02:24:22.440 --> 02:24:26.600]  make it felonies start investigations claiming guns were transferred wrong
[02:24:26.600 --> 02:24:29.560]  it's a license to harass the daylights out of the second amendment
[02:24:29.560 --> 02:24:33.480]  and register them nationally katie bar the door massive assault we thought
[02:24:33.480 --> 02:24:36.840]  would come months later is the biggest salts that its executive order is
[02:24:36.840 --> 02:24:40.600]  outside of law never forget that it's all completely illegal
[02:24:40.600 --> 02:24:44.280]  expound background checks that means put in more stuff not in the gun control
[02:24:44.280 --> 02:24:47.720]  act or not in the next brady bill that's even been
[02:24:47.720 --> 02:24:50.040]  overturned but they don't care they just keep doing it
[02:24:50.040 --> 02:24:53.880]  um they're just going to come after the guns by
[02:24:53.880 --> 02:24:58.040]  adding psychologicals you name it no fly list no one knows why you're on it
[02:24:58.040 --> 02:25:01.400]  members of congress are on it members of homeless security you just you just can't
[02:25:01.400 --> 02:25:05.240]  have a gun boost gun safety technology that's how
[02:25:05.240 --> 02:25:08.280]  smithin weston everybody else basically is leaving california
[02:25:08.280 --> 02:25:15.400]  with micro stamping on each cap uh when uh you fire it uh on
[02:25:15.400 --> 02:25:19.480]  20 foot drop test it's just all this stuff to ban guns with regulations
[02:25:19.480 --> 02:25:23.880]  outside of law more criminal activity uh and then of course we are
[02:25:23.880 --> 02:25:27.560]  only advanced country on earth with frequent violent gun crimes
[02:25:27.560 --> 02:25:31.720]  totally false total lie gun crime has dropped 60 plus percent in the last 20
[02:25:31.720 --> 02:25:34.360]  years and then we've got obama's cry moment let's
[02:25:34.360 --> 02:25:38.840]  go to boost gun safety that means sabotage and have outside of law
[02:25:38.840 --> 02:25:42.200]  regulations to shut down gun manufacturers and render your gun you
[02:25:42.200 --> 02:25:44.760]  own it home illegal first they make new ones have the
[02:25:44.760 --> 02:25:47.480]  micro stamp and all this other stuff then they ban the others that's been
[02:25:47.480 --> 02:25:51.160]  done in other countries they're following an enemy blueprint that's been
[02:25:51.160 --> 02:25:55.400]  successful but again we have the enemy blueprint here it is
[02:25:55.400 --> 02:26:00.040]  we're going to boost gun safety technology now today many gun injuries and
[02:26:00.040 --> 02:26:03.560]  deaths are the result of legal guns that were stolen or misused or
[02:26:03.560 --> 02:26:08.840]  discharged accidentally in 2013 alone more than 500 people lost
[02:26:08.840 --> 02:26:12.440]  their lives to gun accidents and that includes 30 children younger than five
[02:26:12.440 --> 02:26:15.080]  years so now they're going to be biometric and not work
[02:26:15.080 --> 02:26:18.680]  and the greatest most technologically advanced nation on earth
[02:26:18.680 --> 02:26:22.920]  there is no reason for this so this is smart grid where they
[02:26:22.920 --> 02:26:27.160]  technologies where they tend to bring in and in the gun culture set it up so you
[02:26:27.160 --> 02:26:30.520]  can't unlock your phone unless you got the right
[02:26:30.520 --> 02:26:34.360]  fingerprint to a smart grid your car your phone your gun everything
[02:26:34.360 --> 02:26:36.600]  control why can't we do the same thing for our guns
[02:26:36.600 --> 02:26:40.200]  smart guns which means third phone all right that's enough let's go to Wayne
[02:26:40.200 --> 02:26:44.280]  Madsen Wayne this is bold I mean just the executive
[02:26:44.280 --> 02:26:47.160]  action level outside of law what's your view on this
[02:26:47.160 --> 02:26:51.240]  well I just wonder if the this rule will apply to the CIA
[02:26:51.240 --> 02:26:55.160]  which takes advantage of the fact that the US is the largest manufacturer of
[02:26:55.160 --> 02:27:00.040]  small arms on the planet to export weapons to these jihadists for
[02:27:00.040 --> 02:27:03.800]  example fighting against Assad in Syria
[02:27:03.800 --> 02:27:06.840]  the jihadists fighting against the government in Baghdad
[02:27:06.840 --> 02:27:11.400]  which we supposedly supported so are all these jihadists
[02:27:11.400 --> 02:27:14.920]  these weapons exported to the jihadists uh
[02:27:14.920 --> 02:27:19.320]  john brennan's brigades over in all these countries are they going to have all
[02:27:19.320 --> 02:27:23.400]  this smart technology now you know I'd like to I'd like
[02:27:23.400 --> 02:27:27.720]  to see the the details of this proposal Wayne you're a genius I want to
[02:27:27.720 --> 02:27:31.720]  headline at info wars.com with this video tomorrow morning and other
[02:27:31.720 --> 02:27:34.440]  people can write the story too I don't care we're here to fight tyranny
[02:27:34.440 --> 02:27:39.720]  not get scoops headline expert put biometric controls on guns
[02:27:39.720 --> 02:27:43.160]  shipped to Middle East so Al Qaeda can't use them of course you know put
[02:27:43.160 --> 02:27:47.000]  biometric controls or smart controls on guns you're shipping to jihadists or
[02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.880]  how about he just not ship them to the jihadist Wayne exactly
[02:27:49.880 --> 02:27:54.120]  well that would be a better idea but let's see if this is a policy is it's
[02:27:54.120 --> 02:27:57.800]  going to be uniform across the board because certainly
[02:27:57.800 --> 02:28:01.400]  the ISIS boys the the Al Qaeda boys over there
[02:28:01.400 --> 02:28:05.320]  they don't really care about killing kids they killed kids women
[02:28:05.320 --> 02:28:09.560]  pregnant women let's see if they're going to have to have biometric controls
[02:28:09.560 --> 02:28:13.880]  that they can only that's right they've killed an estimated 300 000 people in
[02:28:13.880 --> 02:28:19.240]  Syria hundreds of thousands in Libya tens of thousands in Egypt
[02:28:19.240 --> 02:28:22.280]  though we've got a few thousand gun deaths here that are accidental or whatever
[02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:25.560]  a year i mean how about obama make a big deal about what is jihad forces did
[02:28:25.560 --> 02:28:28.280]  that's a great point right about that you ain't
[02:28:28.280 --> 02:28:32.280]  yeah how about smart knives because we have people running around Europe now
[02:28:32.280 --> 02:28:36.200]  you know stabbing people so i think yeah let's skip the one clip
[02:28:36.200 --> 02:28:40.360]  absolutely uh and let's play obama's cry moment as we go out to break here
[02:28:40.360 --> 02:28:44.920]  let's let's actually play with audio the cry moment wane here it is

[02:28:59.640 --> 02:29:03.160]  those rights were stripped from college kids

[02:34:24.840 --> 02:34:27.880]  and hey it's okay to cry sometimes with bainer he's obviously mentally ill he
[02:34:27.880 --> 02:34:29.480]  cries when he talks about the weather
[02:34:29.480 --> 02:34:33.160]  no not grandma mama dies you cry you know you're not with that
[02:34:33.160 --> 02:34:38.360]  but obama with the fake crying it's literally
[02:34:38.360 --> 02:34:40.600]  literally he keeps touching his eye obviously with pepper or something
[02:34:40.600 --> 02:34:45.160]  he'll just squeeze the tear out like trying to squeeze blood out of a

[02:35:33.400 --> 02:35:35.400]  i mean they're already linked to it yesterday i'm not saying drugs should
[02:35:35.400 --> 02:35:37.160]  link to this but i think this is pretty important
[02:35:37.160 --> 02:35:41.160]  to point out this is the angle what they say is mentally ill
[02:35:41.160 --> 02:35:44.600]  outside of law they're the new acolytes they're the new people there's some
[02:35:44.600 --> 02:35:47.640]  psychologists or psychiatrists that are you know medical doctors you're going
[02:35:47.640 --> 02:35:50.600]  to see you aren't bad people but a lot of them i mean they say it's
[02:35:50.600 --> 02:35:52.840]  mentally ill if you believe world government's being formed
[02:35:52.840 --> 02:35:56.520]  or if you think florida's bad that's their and that's what the soviet union
[02:35:56.520 --> 02:36:00.680]  used to oppress people so kit daniels is in the control room
[02:36:00.680 --> 02:36:04.440]  you talk about mental illness i mean a big black control room with big banners
[02:36:04.440 --> 02:36:09.240]  in gold of george washington and like actual media empire
[02:36:09.240 --> 02:36:13.160]  battling tyranny and reaching tens of millions of people a day now
[02:36:13.160 --> 02:36:17.800]  i mean this is insane what type of fruit cake
[02:36:17.800 --> 02:36:20.360]  he's he's wearing a he's wearing a purple shirt like me that's probably we're
[02:36:20.360 --> 02:36:23.400]  in a cult now i mean what is going on george
[02:36:23.400 --> 02:36:28.600]  washington behind you the terrorist but but i'm being sarcastic but i'm not
[02:36:28.600 --> 02:36:32.600]  i mean this is insane kit daniels yeah uh the whole
[02:36:32.600 --> 02:36:36.200]  angle with mental illness i've covered this for the past two years with very
[02:36:36.200 --> 02:36:39.320]  articles is that the mental illness angle when it
[02:36:39.320 --> 02:36:42.680]  comes to gun control that is the trojan horse back gun
[02:36:42.680 --> 02:36:47.080]  backdoor gun confiscation program remember it was in the 1950s where you
[02:36:47.080 --> 02:36:51.640]  had uh the uh soviet union the communist regime at the time
[02:36:51.640 --> 02:36:55.000]  was declaring don't be racist the loving liberal helpers
[02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:59.160]  yeah they declared anybody who was against Stalin or whoever
[02:36:59.160 --> 02:37:04.440]  was in power to be mentally ill and they came out with a rescue and torture you
[02:37:04.440 --> 02:37:07.720]  did as in many cases but that's liberal and trendy but if a few writers got
[02:37:07.720 --> 02:37:09.480]  banned that's horrible let's make movies about it
[02:37:09.480 --> 02:37:12.440]  sorry go ahead yeah and it's like this whole
[02:37:12.440 --> 02:37:16.680]  thing is that back in the soviet union they were
[02:37:16.680 --> 02:37:20.200]  declaring all these new types of mental illnesses they're saying
[02:37:20.200 --> 02:37:24.200]  you know they wanted someone politically repressed
[02:37:24.200 --> 02:37:27.880]  they came up with some new form of schizophrenia and this is exactly what
[02:37:27.880 --> 02:37:31.640]  you're seeing right now because since the 1950s when the first dsm was printed
[02:37:31.640 --> 02:37:36.200]  out by the apa for the psychologist here in america
[02:37:36.200 --> 02:37:41.960]  they uh increased the number of mental illnesses from about 130 to
[02:37:41.960 --> 02:37:44.920]  over 350 today and just think about how all the
[02:37:44.920 --> 02:37:48.520]  add cases this has been in the news for the past 10-15 years about how many so
[02:37:48.520 --> 02:37:53.240]  many kids that typically would have normal child-like behavior are now
[02:37:53.240 --> 02:37:55.800]  being put on ritalin for saying that they have add
[02:37:55.800 --> 02:37:59.880]  oh yeah oh yeah i mean i mean you go to a medical doctor now they just ask you do
[02:37:59.880 --> 02:38:04.760]  you want uh andy psychotics do you want uh
[02:38:04.760 --> 02:38:09.560]  antidepressants do you want speed yeah so i'm like no i don't want speed and
[02:38:09.560 --> 02:38:13.400]  they go but it's really good and i'm just like dude are you like a guy at a bus
[02:38:13.400 --> 02:38:16.760]  stop trying to sell me drugs here i mean i got coffee okay and i bounce off the
[02:38:16.760 --> 02:38:20.520]  walls on that i do i already i drink four glasses of tea at lubey i have heart
[02:38:20.520 --> 02:38:25.560]  palpitations i do not need speed yeah but exactly this is how crazy
[02:38:25.560 --> 02:38:29.560]  this is gotten and and and don't forget this is the big backdoor attack but
[02:38:29.560 --> 02:38:33.480]  also it's the trifecta the going at your social security recipients if
[02:38:33.480 --> 02:38:37.000]  they're getting automatic money transfers or have any type of homemade
[02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.720]  uh going through their database without law to persecute them with social
[02:38:39.720 --> 02:38:43.880]  workers i mean it's on uh and then also saying you can't transfer a gun to
[02:38:43.880 --> 02:38:48.200]  family members that's a national registration this is the trifecta
[02:38:48.200 --> 02:38:51.400]  brother this is hammerfall and we said last
[02:38:51.400 --> 02:38:54.280]  week it was coming and six months ago it was coming but
[02:38:54.280 --> 02:38:57.240]  i thought they'd do one of these today and a few more later
[02:38:57.240 --> 02:39:00.440]  because the trifecta is nothing compared
[02:39:00.440 --> 02:39:04.200]  to the larger fact this is executive outside of law
[02:39:04.200 --> 02:39:08.120]  that's not even being pointed out so great job kit daniels any other points
[02:39:08.120 --> 02:39:11.480]  yeah i think what's coming up next my prediction is they're going to try to
[02:39:11.480 --> 02:39:15.800]  enforce background checks to even use a gun so for example if i go on a hunting
[02:39:15.800 --> 02:39:19.080]  trip with my friend exactly or my father or whatever you'll have to check in at
[02:39:19.080 --> 02:39:22.600]  the range it's this whole smart thing yeah yeah i can't loan a gun out for
[02:39:22.600 --> 02:39:26.200]  someone to use in the deer stand without him and having a background check
[02:39:26.200 --> 02:39:29.640]  and this and go back to the whole mental illness thing uh it's a two-pronged
[02:39:29.640 --> 02:39:33.320]  attack they get people uh they use the dsm so broad to get people hooked on
[02:39:33.320 --> 02:39:36.920]  all these uh anti-depressants so big pharma can make
[02:39:36.920 --> 02:39:40.600]  money and then they use that to take the guns that's right they don't tell you
[02:39:40.600 --> 02:39:44.600]  when a lady has a car wrecker has a kid they go hey go on lou vox go on prozac
[02:39:44.600 --> 02:39:47.800]  go on paxil they don't tell you now you're designated to be mentally ill
[02:39:47.800 --> 02:39:50.440]  can't have a gun it's like oh i'll have your doctor take this
[02:39:50.440 --> 02:39:53.800]  record so much fun i like that yeah that's good you take it now your rights
[02:39:53.800 --> 02:39:57.960]  are gone outside of law because obama said so get daniels i want everybody to
[02:39:57.960 --> 02:40:01.080]  get your article info wars dot com linkedin red
[02:40:01.080 --> 02:40:06.280]  maximum push folks this is an info war or bend over and take it it's up to you
[02:40:06.280 --> 02:40:10.440]  yeah it's not just an end on uh the second amendment but also due process
[02:40:10.440 --> 02:40:15.080]  that's the real critical point everybody should take executive power grab due
[02:40:15.080 --> 02:40:19.080]  process into the courts i'm sorry go ahead
[02:40:19.080 --> 02:40:21.960]  yeah i mean it should outrage liberals that are
[02:40:21.960 --> 02:40:25.560]  even for gun control because this is a fight against due process
[02:40:25.560 --> 02:40:29.080]  they're on a power trip they think they're part of a cult is taking over
[02:40:29.080 --> 02:40:32.520]  they're making their move they're not liberals but i agree with you
[02:40:32.520 --> 02:40:37.880]  i bless you that story is up on info wars dot com folks it is worse than i
[02:40:37.880 --> 02:40:42.280]  thought it is over the top what's happening now let's go to
[02:40:42.280 --> 02:40:46.040]  our intrepid journalist we've got of course travis
[02:40:46.040 --> 02:40:53.320]  right uh travis night uh of the night clan out there doing a great job
[02:40:53.320 --> 02:40:59.560]  they're in oregon at the site of the militia and the bundes taking over a
[02:40:59.560 --> 02:41:03.800]  federal barn that was empty and it's being called the ultimate hijacking by
[02:41:03.800 --> 02:41:07.640]  the media terrorism y'all kaida is the hashtag all this
[02:41:07.640 --> 02:41:11.400]  bull evil white terrorists you know george soros has crushed them
[02:41:11.400 --> 02:41:14.680]  and i'm just saying hey probably not the best move with obama doing the big gun
[02:41:14.680 --> 02:41:18.040]  grab right now i get the fact the feds are stealing land and all this but
[02:41:18.040 --> 02:41:22.520]  they're stealing it and in prosecuting the hamans
[02:41:22.520 --> 02:41:26.680]  because everybody does fire breaks curtain a written article about it they
[02:41:26.680 --> 02:41:30.200]  did it it burned into some of the federal land that's what you do out there
[02:41:30.200 --> 02:41:34.200]  they have indicted them convicted them you know and it's just a kept group of
[02:41:34.200 --> 02:41:37.640]  slaves out there in oregon to a certain extent a lot of great people too but
[02:41:37.640 --> 02:41:41.480]  it's not southern nevada where they've run out all the ranchers and all this
[02:41:41.480 --> 02:41:45.560]  left the bundes and it's clear cut uh and i think it's got bad optics doesn't
[02:41:45.560 --> 02:41:48.120]  mean i'm judging anybody doesn't mean i'm saying the bundes are feds i don't
[02:41:48.120 --> 02:41:51.160]  think they are but i think the feds undoubtedly every newspaper in the
[02:41:51.160 --> 02:41:54.760]  country are using this there's supposedly the fb is going to cut the power
[02:41:54.760 --> 02:41:59.000]  bigs is about to talk about that uh this is just perfect timing i mean all i'm
[02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:03.400]  going to say is big present to obama nobody can deny that
[02:42:03.400 --> 02:42:06.440]  some will say justice be done by the heavens fall
[02:42:06.440 --> 02:42:09.720]  uh and you know maybe that's the case but joe bigs what are you witnessing out
[02:42:09.720 --> 02:42:13.640]  there in that blizzard joe bigs here with info wars.com now we're
[02:42:13.640 --> 02:42:17.800]  live from the mal here national wildlife refuse just outside of burns
[02:42:17.800 --> 02:42:21.080]  oregon now in burns is actually quite a blizzard going on and we're starting to
[02:42:21.080 --> 02:42:24.520]  get that snow over here now you can barely even see the road so today should
[02:42:24.520 --> 02:42:28.920]  be interesting seen as the fact that the guardian is reporting that the fbi
[02:42:28.920 --> 02:42:32.440]  came out federal agents said that they will be cutting off the power and they
[02:42:32.440 --> 02:42:36.520]  will also be cutting off cell phone reception and then setting up a blockade
[02:42:36.520 --> 02:42:41.640]  not letting any of them come in or out to resupply to contact the outside world
[02:42:41.640 --> 02:42:45.160]  and one of the quotes in the guardian from a federal agent in washington
[02:42:45.160 --> 02:42:48.280]  said they want to let them sit there for a long time and think about what it is
[02:42:48.280 --> 02:42:53.000]  they've done that's right and and what smart
[02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:59.000]  advisors there are that it maneuvered the bundes into this good friends
[02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:02.440]  yeah there's definitely a chance that there could be some opposition that's
[02:43:02.440 --> 02:43:07.400]  uh inside infiltrated that to kind of go against bundy you know i've had some
[02:43:07.400 --> 02:43:10.920]  people some friends who uh work in special ops
[02:43:10.920 --> 02:43:14.280]  some guys who in the military for a long time they actually have friends on the
[02:43:14.280 --> 02:43:17.160]  inside that said that there are snipers set up in positions
[02:43:17.160 --> 02:43:21.240]  we do know that there's drones flying over and uh one of the quotes that i was
[02:43:21.240 --> 02:43:24.200]  given was that they want to take out the bundy brothers
[02:43:24.200 --> 02:43:26.520]  they don't like what they're doing they don't like they're sparking up a
[02:43:26.520 --> 02:43:31.000]  revolution getting people uh a mast and ready to come out
[02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:35.240]  here and stand up against the government so they are at a point where they are
[02:43:35.240 --> 02:43:38.200]  done with the bundy brothers from what i've heard so it's going to be an
[02:43:38.200 --> 02:43:41.560]  interesting day to say the least especially if they cut off the power
[02:43:41.560 --> 02:43:46.920]  the cell phone reception and then set up a blockade to cut off the resupply route
[02:43:46.920 --> 02:43:50.040]  well all i know is the globalist and people involved better watch their
[02:43:50.040 --> 02:43:52.840]  butts because the feds always burn their informants and their minions
[02:43:52.840 --> 02:43:56.280]  afterwards and this is a big nasty coming down one of the one of the worst
[02:43:56.280 --> 02:43:59.480]  things that could happen though is if they actually were to try to do
[02:43:59.480 --> 02:44:03.160]  something now all that's going to do is make the bundy is a martyr
[02:44:03.160 --> 02:44:06.840]  and then you're going to see a large group of people across this country stand
[02:44:06.840 --> 02:44:09.960]  up rise up and you're going to see a lot more of these standoffs happen
[02:44:09.960 --> 02:44:14.600]  which is exactly here's my issue tell me if you agree or disagree
[02:44:14.600 --> 02:44:17.640]  the bundys are great people i get their point the feds are out of control it's
[02:44:17.640 --> 02:44:21.080]  wrong it's just 21 the locals don't want them the
[02:44:21.080 --> 02:44:25.080]  hammers don't want it and that's why this dog doesn't hunt this
[02:44:25.080 --> 02:44:29.080]  isn't their land their grazing rights it doesn't have the same optics
[02:44:29.080 --> 02:44:32.520]  and this is perfect timing for obama why have the bundy's been out there for
[02:44:32.520 --> 02:44:35.160]  months off and on and now all this breaks loose
[02:44:35.160 --> 02:44:38.520]  right when obama rolls out as offensive against the patriots i mean
[02:44:38.520 --> 02:44:42.040]  come on people this this is really smells
[02:44:42.040 --> 02:44:45.560]  yeah it's definitely interesting how this is all played out and it will be
[02:44:45.560 --> 02:44:49.800]  interesting to see how this unfolds over the next 24 hours especially
[02:44:49.800 --> 02:44:53.400]  when they're expecting more snow to fall temperatures to drop
[02:44:53.400 --> 02:44:58.920]  to see how this uh happened now today we went out and investigated uh reports
[02:44:58.920 --> 02:45:03.160]  that there were a fbi uh federal agents amassing at schools across the burns
[02:45:03.160 --> 02:45:06.440]  area we weren't able to find any but i have been noticing a lot of the
[02:45:06.440 --> 02:45:09.800]  militiamen with binoculars starting to look out across the
[02:45:09.800 --> 02:45:13.240]  land to different areas so maybe they've seen some movement out here in these
[02:45:13.240 --> 02:45:17.720]  hills maybe the fbi left early this morning and already have a
[02:45:17.720 --> 02:45:21.000]  certain spot set up and they've got their eyes on this area for when they do
[02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:25.800]  shut the power to see how the militia and the bundys react
[02:45:25.800 --> 02:45:30.360]  well this is just a giant extravaganza for the establishment with the wrong
[02:45:30.360 --> 02:45:35.160]  optics i mean i couldn't pick a worse place for this to be going down in a
[02:45:35.160 --> 02:45:38.200]  worse time but uh that's it's a free country
[02:45:38.200 --> 02:45:42.280]  folks can do what they want can't they uh and i'm just going to continue trying
[02:45:42.280 --> 02:45:45.640]  to warn folks that we have an executive branch
[02:45:45.640 --> 02:45:49.960]  power grab outside of law to register guns not let you transfer guns
[02:45:49.960 --> 02:45:52.680]  to let psychologists take guns whenever they want
[02:45:52.680 --> 02:45:56.760]  to uh to take social security recipients guns i mean this is in politico
[02:45:56.760 --> 02:45:59.880]  there are now and to now say if you criticize the government your guns can
[02:45:59.880 --> 02:46:03.320]  be taken i mean this is worse than i thought
[02:46:03.320 --> 02:46:06.680]  joe well the interesting thing is what happened in waco
[02:46:06.680 --> 02:46:10.120]  with the dividends when the fbi did roll in and they shut off the power
[02:46:10.120 --> 02:46:13.000]  is this going to happen again are they going to
[02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:17.960]  have another assault like that here at the refuge
[02:46:17.960 --> 02:46:21.240]  and by the way the rnc head has announced obama gun control executive
[02:46:21.240 --> 02:46:23.480]  actions is dangerous power grab so finally
[02:46:23.480 --> 02:46:26.920]  that narrative just the last few hours is getting out there that's bigger than
[02:46:26.920 --> 02:46:29.880]  the seven gun grabs they're announcing of the three big ones
[02:46:29.880 --> 02:46:33.640]  is that the president can't shut our power plants off because he felt like it
[02:46:33.640 --> 02:46:37.080]  when he was on his prayer rug in the morning uh the president can't just
[02:46:37.080 --> 02:46:40.680]  take our guns because he found it in the toilet you know and decided it was a
[02:46:40.680 --> 02:46:44.840]  royal scroll or something uh the president is not god
[02:46:44.840 --> 02:46:47.960]  and uh you know him and all his degenerate supporters think they're
[02:46:47.960 --> 02:46:52.360]  about to have some great war and i mean my god the george soros people
[02:46:52.360 --> 02:46:56.120]  saying these are white terrorists and y'all kaida and all this i mean they
[02:46:56.120 --> 02:47:01.320]  are really just spoiling i mean absolutely spoiling for a war
[02:47:01.320 --> 02:47:04.600]  last time i had an opportunity to actually go down here to where the uh
[02:47:04.600 --> 02:47:08.040]  the federal facilities are there's about seven or eight buildings down there
[02:47:08.040 --> 02:47:11.400]  and when i went down there this was after they had let certain media go
[02:47:11.400 --> 02:47:14.680]  through i got my own little private tour later on in the afternoon
[02:47:14.680 --> 02:47:18.120]  there was got there were guys and they're shoveling snow off the sidewalks
[02:47:18.120 --> 02:47:22.040]  none of the the federal truck serve vehicles had been broken into
[02:47:22.040 --> 02:47:25.080]  bothered none of the uh buildings that i could see from the outside
[02:47:25.080 --> 02:47:28.520]  looking in were damaged in any kind of way so they're not down there running a
[02:47:28.520 --> 02:47:32.440]  muck they really do have uh i believe bundy has a
[02:47:32.440 --> 02:47:35.880]  a pure intention that he does want to take care of the land but like you said
[02:47:35.880 --> 02:47:39.400]  there is a timing this is coming at a wrong time with obama coming out with
[02:47:39.400 --> 02:47:42.440]  this uh this gun grab initiative he wants all
[02:47:42.440 --> 02:47:46.040]  this to happen so it's definitely going to be an interesting and intense
[02:47:46.040 --> 02:47:50.840]  next 24 hours here in oregon well i agree with you you can see the daily
[02:47:50.840 --> 02:47:54.200]  mail and everybody else join the bunny militia group at the center of
[02:47:54.200 --> 02:47:57.960]  oregon land dispute is taken to task by twitter is there mocked by
[02:47:57.960 --> 02:48:05.240]  hashtags including y'all kaida and ye hottest meal team six
[02:48:05.240 --> 02:48:09.560]  and and look i get you that the bunnies are great people
[02:48:09.560 --> 02:48:12.520]  and the optics were right the cause was right in
[02:48:12.520 --> 02:48:16.840]  there and but i mean here's my deal it's like
[02:48:16.840 --> 02:48:20.360]  getting permission to go down by the federal buildings well i thought you're
[02:48:20.360 --> 02:48:23.960]  a citizen it's the people's land i'm told there's people with gates and
[02:48:23.960 --> 02:48:27.800]  controls into there i mean if it's just so open to the public can i just
[02:48:27.800 --> 02:48:32.840]  can i just wall sin or or am i evil uh joe begs
[02:48:32.840 --> 02:48:36.520]  yeah you're evil we're all evil we're the we're the uh
[02:48:36.520 --> 02:48:40.600]  the sheep that the the government want to run around and push around
[02:48:40.600 --> 02:48:43.800]  and that's why you see a lot of people changing now when you have people like
[02:48:43.800 --> 02:48:47.080]  donald trump standing up and saying what people are too scared to say and when
[02:48:47.080 --> 02:48:51.320]  you see patriots coming across and gathering and saying hey enough is
[02:48:51.320 --> 02:48:54.600]  enough we're tired this isn't great this is going to be a great year it's
[02:48:54.600 --> 02:48:58.200]  2000 2016 will be a year of a great awakening
[02:48:58.200 --> 02:49:01.640]  that's already been happening but this year will be a pivotal time in american
[02:49:01.640 --> 02:49:05.160]  history that's right and msnbc's
[02:49:05.160 --> 02:49:07.880]  harris parry that says your kids don't belong to you and then
[02:49:07.880 --> 02:49:11.560]  watch for the biggest problem in america says confiscate legal guns so men
[02:49:11.560 --> 02:49:15.720]  don't shoot their wives i mean they are going for i mean look at this
[02:49:15.720 --> 02:49:21.960]  look at this what's his name uh yeah montel williams last night he was
[02:49:21.960 --> 02:49:25.080]  tweeting in the night before said that white tear had struck
[02:49:25.080 --> 02:49:28.440]  oregon and i made a couple of videos on my own personal accounts
[02:49:28.440 --> 02:49:32.120]  and in fact as you can see white tear is falling from the sky
[02:49:32.120 --> 02:49:39.080]  and it's now laid itself across the ground white tear has
[02:49:39.080 --> 02:49:43.000]  right it's it's it's snowing pretty hard hold on joe for your skype to come back
[02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:47.400]  here's my question yesterday i was saying go in and interview the people
[02:49:47.400 --> 02:49:50.200]  and they're like well i have to wait till they let me in and go in there
[02:49:50.200 --> 02:49:53.960]  my point is is it because i get what they're doing but is it federal land
[02:49:53.960 --> 02:49:57.880]  people's land or is it their land now the folks inside i mean are they letting
[02:49:57.880 --> 02:50:00.920]  the general public or people they've called from all over the country to come
[02:50:00.920 --> 02:50:05.320]  there are are they letting them into the group of federal buildings
[02:50:05.320 --> 02:50:08.840]  we just lost pigs i mean that's what i'm getting at because you know
[02:50:08.840 --> 02:50:11.480]  it's kind of like the feds don't have any right to say you could be in here but
[02:50:11.480 --> 02:50:15.560]  you know i mean that's what this comes down to is i don't want a coup in this
[02:50:15.560 --> 02:50:17.800]  country because nine times out of ten you get
[02:50:17.800 --> 02:50:21.400]  something worse than what you just had and we're making major inroads with
[02:50:21.400 --> 02:50:24.440]  governors and other people who try to turn this country around
[02:50:24.440 --> 02:50:30.280]  and soros wants to war with police i'm against it
[02:50:30.280 --> 02:50:33.560]  government wants to take the guns i'm against it the point is joe i'm gonna
[02:50:33.560 --> 02:50:36.440]  come back and talk to you on the other side i want to ask you the question
[02:50:36.440 --> 02:50:40.200]  is it free to go into these federal buildings that they've taken over or
[02:50:40.200 --> 02:50:42.760]  is it is it theirs now no one else is allowed to
[02:50:42.760 --> 02:50:46.280]  get in i mean we're gonna be talking to one of the bundy sons later tonight for
[02:50:46.280 --> 02:50:48.760]  the nightly news so we can ask that question because remember you were
[02:50:48.760 --> 02:50:51.720]  yesterday talking about getting permission to go in i mean you to get
[02:50:51.720 --> 02:50:55.000]  that from the feds or the folks that are in there who's the boss i guess
[02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:59.240]  citizens aren't welcome in america we'll be back
[02:50:59.240 --> 02:51:02.680]  something just happened that is explained why survival food is literally
[02:51:02.680 --> 02:51:06.280]  flying off the shelves and has sold out in many areas of the country
[02:51:06.280 --> 02:51:09.640]  it caught me totally by surprise and it involves

[02:53:06.760 --> 02:53:10.200]  something shocking just happened in a coast guard unit in san diego
[02:53:10.200 --> 02:53:13.800]  the old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young

[02:53:27.960 --> 02:53:31.160]  that it's made their achy joints stiff muscles and lack of energy
[02:53:31.160 --> 02:53:34.760]  a thing of the past previously this drink was only available to elite

[02:54:18.600 --> 02:54:21.800]  feed me
[02:54:21.800 --> 02:54:24.600]  all right i'm going five minutes to the next hour then david nice taking over
[02:54:24.600 --> 02:54:28.760]  with all the latest breaking news more the obama gun grab clips
[02:54:28.760 --> 02:54:33.240]  we're at an advantage but also the negative on two different fronts
[02:54:33.240 --> 02:54:36.360]  we know what's coming before it comes we're informed but then when it actually
[02:54:36.360 --> 02:54:39.240]  comes we're almost kind of comfortable with it because we know it was coming
[02:54:39.240 --> 02:54:43.160]  forever but just look back at all the stuff
[02:54:43.160 --> 02:54:46.440]  we're putting up with and then just know it's going to get worse that we say no
[02:54:46.440 --> 02:54:49.800]  and no complying with this corrupt system doesn't help us
[02:54:49.800 --> 02:54:55.400]  but at the same time going too far you know with armed sit-ins in the middle
[02:54:55.400 --> 02:54:59.720]  of nowhere where the system can demonize you i don't think it's a good idea
[02:54:59.720 --> 02:55:02.120]  overall uh we're gonna go back to jail basically get
[02:55:02.120 --> 02:55:07.160]  his take on this and where this is going but before we do that
[02:55:07.160 --> 02:55:10.200]  if you're not spreading the word about this broadcast you're crazy
[02:55:10.200 --> 02:55:14.040]  i mean we reach 20 plus million people a week now we're growing exponentially
[02:55:14.040 --> 02:55:18.360]  we're under enemy attack we're clearly a flagship operation against tyranny
[02:55:18.360 --> 02:55:22.120]  we're committed we're craved we're unapologetic we're foaming at the mouth
[02:55:22.120 --> 02:55:25.640]  quite frankly that's what it takes to defeat the enemy as one of the top
[02:55:25.640 --> 02:55:31.720]  samurai said i forget his name one of the most famous as he said desperate
[02:55:31.720 --> 02:55:35.720]  desperateness is the way of the samurai
[02:55:35.720 --> 02:55:39.000]  a hundred men cannot stand against a man who's desperate
[02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:42.360]  and it just totally turns himself loose and that means not caring what your
[02:55:42.360 --> 02:55:45.320]  neighbors think not caring whatever happens just do the right thing
[02:55:45.320 --> 02:55:48.680]  and so i get the way of the samurai is being desperate in this what the
[02:55:48.680 --> 02:55:52.440]  bundies are doing but there's kind of a middle way in all of that
[02:55:52.440 --> 02:55:56.280]  and maybe i'll be proven wrong but i supported what they did at great risk
[02:55:56.280 --> 02:55:59.160]  the last go around i mean who knows what could have happened there but it all
[02:55:59.160 --> 02:56:03.480]  seemed and felt right my good old boy guts don't feel good maybe i'm wrong
[02:56:03.480 --> 02:56:06.840]  maybe we'll work this out and maybe us being concerned and you being concerned
[02:56:06.840 --> 02:56:11.480]  and wargaming this is gonna fix it but when we come out and say watch out for
[02:56:11.480 --> 02:56:15.240]  feds infiltrating and provocaturing shut up you said i'm a fed boy

[02:56:22.040 --> 02:56:25.000]  lightning strikes and thunderstorm people go that's crazy

[03:00:40.200 --> 03:00:43.880]  probably undoubtedly a major shot across the bow

[03:01:48.840 --> 03:01:53.080]  told we have this my audio's a bit muffled okay

[03:01:59.480 --> 03:02:02.120]  here you can actually kind of see down to the compound
[03:02:02.120 --> 03:02:05.640]  there are quite a few buildings over in that area um
[03:02:05.640 --> 03:02:08.520]  we still haven't seen any police show up yet we still haven't seen any agents we
[03:02:08.520 --> 03:02:11.640]  haven't heard anything yet so we're going to be standing by
[03:02:11.640 --> 03:02:15.720]  trying to uh get an interview with amon bundy later on this afternoon
[03:02:15.720 --> 03:02:19.160]  and uh we'll be bringing updates as soon as we can
[03:02:19.160 --> 03:02:21.800]  so we've got a couple videos already filed we're just trying to get those
[03:02:21.800 --> 03:02:25.400]  uploaded but the internet signal and the uh the cell phone signal here's not too
[03:02:25.400 --> 03:02:27.800]  good i understand we'll try to interview some of the
[03:02:27.800 --> 03:02:31.400]  Hammons as well some of the locals and then just continue to cover what's
[03:02:31.400 --> 03:02:34.680]  going on but i got a feeling that they're just going to leave them out there
[03:02:34.680 --> 03:02:37.400]  for weeks and then say look at the crazies that took over
[03:02:37.400 --> 03:02:40.760]  i'm not saying they're that i'm reading what the newspapers are saying
[03:02:40.760 --> 03:02:44.600]  we've got some of your reports and hd up on infowords.com
[03:02:44.600 --> 03:02:47.960]  and so we'll continue to break all this down joe what's the temperature out
[03:02:47.960 --> 03:02:52.280]  there oh it's about 20 degrees i think uh
[03:02:52.280 --> 03:02:56.680]  so i'm sure that'll drop again tonight as the the darkness starts to settle
[03:02:56.680 --> 03:03:00.200]  like last night i got down to about uh i believe like 15 or 14
[03:03:00.200 --> 03:03:03.160]  when the snow started coming in and as you can see it's kind of snow in here
[03:03:03.160 --> 03:03:07.000]  but it's not that bad like over and burns right over to my left uh or to my
[03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:10.920]  right actually to your left it is a blizzard going on i could barely even
[03:03:10.920 --> 03:03:14.280]  see you could barely even see the roads the cops had a lot of areas blocked off
[03:03:14.280 --> 03:03:18.040]  and due to bad traffic so we're gonna have to go through a lot of that later on
[03:03:18.040 --> 03:03:21.720]  all right joe continue to cover all that with Travis god bless we'll talk to
[03:03:21.720 --> 03:03:25.000]  you again tonight on the nightly news seven o'clock central
[03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:28.520]  thank you all right look at these drugs report headlines

[03:03:48.360 --> 03:03:52.120]  this is this is crazy this is out of control
[03:03:52.120 --> 03:03:56.280]  but again it's lawless it's only gonna wake people up faster
[03:03:56.280 --> 03:03:59.320]  congress is illegitimate the nine percent approval rating they want to
[03:03:59.320 --> 03:04:02.600]  start a race war with black lives matter it's on record
[03:04:02.600 --> 03:04:05.800]  they want to start civil unrest they want to start the patriots blowing

[03:04:25.240 --> 03:04:27.960]  didn't get elected hillary did it really be over then but no she'd be too
[03:04:27.960 --> 03:04:30.840]  dangerous i like trump the problems they may blame the
[03:04:30.840 --> 03:04:35.800]  imploding economy on him or rand paul or or or whoever

[03:04:59.160 --> 03:05:03.480]  while president obama attempts to enact gun control via executive action
[03:05:03.480 --> 03:05:06.680]  a new gallup poll shows that only two percent of americans
[03:05:06.680 --> 03:05:11.640]  believe that guns or gun control are among the country's top problems
[03:05:11.640 --> 03:05:15.320]  gallup asked about 1 000 americans in all 50 states
[03:05:15.320 --> 03:05:18.600]  what they thought the nation's top problems were in 2015
[03:05:18.600 --> 03:05:23.000]  and out of 23 problems mentioned by americans guns gun control
[03:05:23.000 --> 03:05:27.880]  ranked near the bottom at 19th in comparison 16 percent of americans
[03:05:27.880 --> 03:05:30.840]  said that the government was the nation's biggest issue
[03:05:30.840 --> 03:05:35.240]  13 percent said the economy eight percent said unemployment and another
[03:05:35.240 --> 03:05:38.760]  eight said immigration but rather than working on these hot
[03:05:38.760 --> 03:05:43.080]  button issues both president obama and the mainstream media would rather
[03:05:43.080 --> 03:05:46.760]  focus on gun control with a president even stating that he
[03:05:46.760 --> 03:05:49.960]  wants to quote make gun control part of his legacy

[03:08:45.880 --> 03:08:50.680]  in this fourth hour of the alex jones broadcast and i wanted to tell alex this
[03:08:50.680 --> 03:08:54.120]  i'm sure he'll hear this but he's been proven right
[03:08:54.120 --> 03:08:57.880]  yet again this is something that kello mcbrain who works here
[03:08:57.880 --> 03:09:03.480]  gave me and of course alex has said many times that the chemicals in the water
[03:09:03.480 --> 03:09:07.720]  are changing the sex of the fish and other things this he's been
[03:09:07.720 --> 03:09:12.840]  ridiculed about that by rachel madow chris haze others at msnbc and elsewhere
[03:09:12.840 --> 03:09:16.600]  uh distorting his comments well this is something that was put out by science
[03:09:16.600 --> 03:09:20.680]  magazine on january the fourth and it referenced back to an article from the
[03:09:20.680 --> 03:09:24.280]  washington post on december 30th and yes they have
[03:09:24.280 --> 03:09:30.360]  mass male basses are experiencing unwanted sex changes okay they say male
[03:09:30.360 --> 03:09:34.920]  bass are experiencing unwanted sex changes apparently due to chemical
[03:09:34.920 --> 03:09:38.920]  soups that pass for waterways in the northeast they say 85 percent
[03:09:38.920 --> 03:09:42.280]  of smallmouth bass surveyed in the region have characteristics of the
[03:09:42.280 --> 03:09:46.040]  opposite sex in other words they have eggs where their testes
[03:09:46.040 --> 03:09:49.960]  should be they say 27 percent of the large mass uh large
[03:09:49.960 --> 03:09:54.520]  mouth bass uh have that problem i'm having difficulty uh
[03:09:54.520 --> 03:09:58.680]  it's just so unbelievable yeah exactly okay so and of course what is it that
[03:09:58.680 --> 03:10:02.760]  that's causing this with them most the same stuff that we're exposed to right
[03:10:02.760 --> 03:10:06.440]  they says uh it is a they say it's a problem everywhere it's coming from
[03:10:06.440 --> 03:10:09.960]  birth control pills from pesticides from hormones and livestock manure other
[03:10:09.960 --> 03:10:15.000]  chemical heavy products and of course it's also the bpa uh the plastics that
[03:10:15.000 --> 03:10:17.960]  are in the water uh the washington post story
[03:10:17.960 --> 03:10:22.040]  breaks it down and says hey this isn't limited just to these urban areas it's
[03:10:22.040 --> 03:10:26.440]  not just the metrosexual bass i guess you could call them okay this is
[03:10:26.440 --> 03:10:29.320]  this is also happening in rural areas but it's also happening in
[03:10:29.320 --> 03:10:32.760]  japan and they say that studies have been done there on
[03:10:32.760 --> 03:10:36.760]  medaka fish if i'm pronouncing that correctly um they say that species
[03:10:36.760 --> 03:10:40.760]  reproduces very quickly so they like to use them uh in tests because they
[03:10:40.760 --> 03:10:45.080]  reproduce more quickly than the uh smallmouth bass do
[03:10:45.080 --> 03:10:49.000]  that's the issue though okay and so when rachel madow
[03:10:49.000 --> 03:10:52.440]  starts making fun of alex jones for that we need to have her check
[03:10:52.440 --> 03:10:56.440]  and see if chris haze is ovulating uh because
[03:10:56.440 --> 03:10:59.160]  you know that's that's essentially where this is all going all right enough of
[03:10:59.160 --> 03:11:03.000]  that let's go to what's happening with obama and the executive orders and
[03:11:03.000 --> 03:11:05.960]  we're going to play some clips we're going to show you some statistics uh
[03:11:05.960 --> 03:11:09.480]  we've got a uh chart that is uh set up here you you think that there's not any
[03:11:09.480 --> 03:11:12.520]  background checks yeah there's a lot of background checks being made but first
[03:11:12.520 --> 03:11:15.400]  of all let's talk about executive orders and i want to give you a little bit of
[03:11:15.400 --> 03:11:19.320]  a background about this we we hear people talking about um uh
[03:11:19.320 --> 03:11:23.160]  obama's executive orders he's not the first person to do this of course
[03:11:23.160 --> 03:11:27.160]  and he's not the person who has done the most of course fdr did over
[03:11:27.160 --> 03:11:31.800]  3500 executive orders and some of them were major executive orders he was
[03:11:31.800 --> 03:11:37.320]  really uh reconfiguring the country in a way that obama hopes to do as well
[03:11:37.320 --> 03:11:41.800]  things like gold prohibition fdr did that just by executive order he said
[03:11:41.800 --> 03:11:45.480]  i'm going to prohibit gold and i remember uh uh minkin who was a commentator
[03:11:45.480 --> 03:11:49.800]  hl minkin said well you know a year ago if i had a flask of whiskey in my
[03:11:49.800 --> 03:11:54.120]  pocket i was violating the law but the the uh gold coin that i had was okay
[03:11:54.120 --> 03:11:57.080]  now this year it's gone the other way around they they got rid of alcohol
[03:11:57.080 --> 03:12:01.400]  prohibition and then they prohibited gold he also did by executive order
[03:12:01.400 --> 03:12:05.560]  japanese and german concentration camps here in america that was an executive
[03:12:05.560 --> 03:12:09.000]  order he also created the export import bank that we're
[03:12:09.000 --> 03:12:13.080]  still suffering under we had uh minkin you know going back to that the
[03:12:13.080 --> 03:12:16.520]  emancipation proclamation for example was an executive order now you say
[03:12:16.520 --> 03:12:19.560]  may say that's a that's a good thing but we have to understand
[03:12:19.560 --> 03:12:23.960]  that was a gimmick that actually freed no one it listed the states that were
[03:12:23.960 --> 03:12:26.600]  still in rebellion and freed the slaves that were there
[03:12:26.600 --> 03:12:29.800]  even though there were some states border states and others that still had
[03:12:29.800 --> 03:12:33.880]  slavery uh general grant general ulysses grant kept his
[03:12:33.880 --> 03:12:37.880]  slaves until they were outlawed after the war
[03:12:37.880 --> 03:12:41.800]  with the 14th amendment with some states specifically outlawing it even
[03:12:41.800 --> 03:12:44.120]  before the 14th amendment but abraham lincoln
[03:12:44.120 --> 03:12:46.840]  didn't free a single slave but what he did do
[03:12:46.840 --> 03:12:51.160]  was he did repeal habeas corpus by executive order
[03:12:51.160 --> 03:12:54.520]  we have bill clinton he waged the kosovo war with executive order
[03:12:54.520 --> 03:13:00.520]  we have george w bush he called he stopped all public access to uh
[03:13:00.520 --> 03:13:05.720]  presidential information and that was overturned by obama when he took order
[03:13:05.720 --> 03:13:10.200]  but what is the what is the parameters where they can stop
[03:13:10.200 --> 03:13:14.040]  executive order truman hit the limit okay
[03:13:14.040 --> 03:13:18.520]  truman went to try to nationalize the steel mills now they were in the middle
[03:13:18.520 --> 03:13:22.520]  of a labor dispute it was a korean war and he was concerned about the source
[03:13:22.520 --> 03:13:26.600]  of steel being shut down so when he couldn't get them to work
[03:13:26.600 --> 03:13:30.600]  together the labor unions and the people who own the steel mills
[03:13:30.600 --> 03:13:33.320]  he said well we're just going to take over the steel mills
[03:13:33.320 --> 03:13:36.360]  and the steel mill owners immediately sued
[03:13:36.360 --> 03:13:40.520]  and that resulted in a supreme court case the youngstown decision
[03:13:40.520 --> 03:13:43.480]  and this is what one of the justices said he said
[03:13:43.480 --> 03:13:46.440]  well they overturned that decision because they said you don't really have
[03:13:46.440 --> 03:13:50.840]  the power to do that you don't have the power to just
[03:13:50.840 --> 03:13:53.480]  be a dictator and they said here's the three tests
[03:13:53.480 --> 03:13:56.920]  number one the president acts with most authority and this is written
[03:13:56.920 --> 03:14:01.800]  in the majority opinion by the supreme court justice robert h jackson he said
[03:14:01.800 --> 03:14:05.320]  the president acts with the most authority when he has the express
[03:14:05.320 --> 03:14:09.080]  or implied consent of congress is is that the case right here
[03:14:09.080 --> 03:14:12.680]  we're going to play a clip for you let's play this clip of obama's
[03:14:12.680 --> 03:14:16.760]  press secretary josh earnes talking about why
[03:14:16.760 --> 03:14:21.400]  obama did this executive order on guns i would anticipate that the president
[03:14:21.400 --> 03:14:27.400]  will have an announcement quite soon where he will discuss some steps that
[03:14:27.400 --> 03:14:31.000]  his administration has concluded and that he has concluded
[03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:34.600]  are within his executive authority that would keep guns out of the
[03:14:34.600 --> 03:14:38.680]  hands of people who shouldn't have them and there are common sense steps that
[03:14:38.680 --> 03:14:42.760]  he can take using his authority that do not undermine the
[03:14:42.760 --> 03:14:47.000]  constitutional rights of law-abiding americans but we have to do something in
[03:14:47.000 --> 03:14:53.800]  this country to address the consequences of congress's failure to act
[03:14:53.800 --> 03:14:59.400]  and look there are more than 30 000 americans
[03:14:59.400 --> 03:15:04.440]  who die every year as a result of a gun okay let's pull it right there
[03:15:04.440 --> 03:15:07.560]  that's the key thing you've heard this before we've all heard this before i
[03:15:07.560 --> 03:15:11.320]  think sorry the president has to do something because
[03:15:11.320 --> 03:15:15.480]  congress doesn't want to okay congress has blocked what he wants to have
[03:15:15.480 --> 03:15:19.000]  happened well the president the supreme court said
[03:15:19.000 --> 03:15:21.800]  back in the youngstown decision said the president has the most authority
[03:15:21.800 --> 03:15:25.560]  when he has the express or implied consent of congress
[03:15:25.560 --> 03:15:30.040]  he is clearly acting against their direct wishes they say he has uncertain
[03:15:30.040 --> 03:15:33.720]  authority if they've been silent in the course it was kind of interesting
[03:15:33.720 --> 03:15:37.320]  he called it a zone of twilight not the twilight zone because this is a 50s this
[03:15:37.320 --> 03:15:40.360]  is before the series but yeah we are entering the twilight
[03:15:40.360 --> 03:15:45.480]  zone because we've got a president who according to the supreme court decision
[03:15:45.480 --> 03:15:48.520]  says has the least authority when he's doing things that are
[03:15:48.520 --> 03:15:53.000]  incompatible with the express or implied will of congress such an act wrote
[03:15:53.000 --> 03:15:56.680]  justice jackson threatens the equilibrium established by our
[03:15:56.680 --> 03:16:01.000]  constitutional system yes he becomes a dictator doesn't he jacari jackson
[03:16:01.000 --> 03:16:05.160]  well you know we were watching these clips of the president and he's
[03:16:05.160 --> 03:16:07.880]  you know listing all the victims and all the shootings and all this he didn't
[03:16:07.880 --> 03:16:11.400]  mention border patrol agent brian terry he doesn't mention the people that are
[03:16:11.400 --> 03:16:14.200]  killed by the cartels being armed he doesn't mention the people who are
[03:16:14.200 --> 03:16:17.080]  being killed by ices and al-qaeda who were dropping grenades
[03:16:17.080 --> 03:16:20.040]  and giving funding to he doesn't mention the people who were killed when the
[03:16:20.040 --> 03:16:23.960]  drone strikes and jets blow up hospitals and wedding parties he doesn't
[03:16:23.960 --> 03:16:27.560]  mention anything about these people and even when he was mentioning
[03:16:27.560 --> 03:16:31.000]  chicago at the end of his speech he kind of glossed over throughout chicago
[03:16:31.000 --> 03:16:33.160]  he didn't mention that chicago was a gun for his own
[03:16:33.160 --> 03:16:37.240]  oh yeah the airport yes so yeah yeah and in the city of chicago now they're
[03:16:37.240 --> 03:16:40.680]  saying that the police officers at the airport are supposed to run away from
[03:16:40.680 --> 03:16:43.320]  the active shooter not actually engage the active shooter and these are not
[03:16:43.320 --> 03:16:48.680]  reticops these are not tsa these are sworn law officers okay they have police
[03:16:48.680 --> 03:16:51.560]  uniforms police badges i mean they're legitimate cops
[03:16:51.560 --> 03:16:54.760]  but they take away their guns because they want the airport
[03:16:54.760 --> 03:16:57.960]  to be a gun-free zone how's that going to work
[03:16:57.960 --> 03:17:02.680]  uh when you guys a couple of guys uh drive up with the ak-47s and hand
[03:17:02.680 --> 03:17:06.200]  grenades like they did at that church in south africa and just start
[03:17:06.200 --> 03:17:10.600]  uh spraying and uh hurling grenades i mean you had one guy in that church they
[03:17:10.600 --> 03:17:13.960]  knew it was a gun-free zone they knew it was a liberal church they knew it had
[03:17:13.960 --> 03:17:16.600]  over a thousand people on it so they were going to attack it
[03:17:16.600 --> 03:17:20.760]  and uh they they went into that church and they didn't realize it that day
[03:17:20.760 --> 03:17:24.680]  one guy was visiting with a concealed carry from and he wasn't even a member
[03:17:24.680 --> 03:17:28.040]  of that church and with a uh a small revolver with
[03:17:28.040 --> 03:17:32.600]  only five shots and he was all the way across the church
[03:17:32.600 --> 03:17:35.880]  open area there where they came in he got down and he took a couple of shots
[03:17:35.880 --> 03:17:39.160]  i'm never going to hit him from here went around the backside took another
[03:17:39.160 --> 03:17:42.120]  couple of shots they thought there were multiple shooters he had hit one of
[03:17:42.120 --> 03:17:45.720]  them with that shot all the way catty corner across the uh the sanctuary the
[03:17:45.720 --> 03:17:49.240]  auditorium whatever and uh they fled and they said
[03:17:49.240 --> 03:17:52.360]  after they had the truth and reconciliation uh after everything came
[03:17:52.360 --> 03:17:54.520]  together in south africa they said their intention
[03:17:54.520 --> 03:17:57.480]  was to kill everyone in that church so they killed quite a few people because
[03:17:57.480 --> 03:18:01.000]  they threw hand grenades in first and started spraying the crowd
[03:18:01.000 --> 03:18:03.800]  yes absolutely that's what's going to happen at the airport
[03:18:03.800 --> 03:18:07.320]  if somebody gets serious about this because even the police they're telling
[03:18:07.320 --> 03:18:10.280]  run and hide because we're not going to let you protect yourself or protect
[03:18:10.280 --> 03:18:13.880]  others and i mean all this uh quote reasonable you know
[03:18:13.880 --> 03:18:17.160]  regulations that he's pushing through you know the all the background checks
[03:18:17.160 --> 03:18:21.000]  can we have that that background check graphic guys we can show the people and
[03:18:21.000 --> 03:18:25.080]  well uh we'll read this for the people who are listening on the radio
[03:18:25.080 --> 03:18:28.600]  uh we heard consistently you know there's not enough background checks going on
[03:18:28.600 --> 03:18:31.640]  if you go to info wars.com forward slash show you can see the
[03:18:31.640 --> 03:18:37.320]  totals of background checks in 2014 to 2015 uh in just one state in 2014
[03:18:37.320 --> 03:18:41.720]  kentucky had 2.4 i guess 2.5 million background checks
[03:18:41.720 --> 03:18:46.520]  this year kentucky had 3.2 million with a grand total for the nation of
[03:18:46.520 --> 03:18:51.960]  23 million uh about 23 million background checks and that's all 50 states for
[03:18:51.960 --> 03:18:55.160]  the year of 2015 and of course we just had the
[03:18:55.160 --> 03:18:58.600]  attorney general in virginia say that they're not going to
[03:18:58.600 --> 03:19:02.200]  recognize concealed carry permits from all these different states kentucky was
[03:19:02.200 --> 03:19:04.840]  one of them and he said uh we're not going to recognize
[03:19:04.840 --> 03:19:08.520]  because we don't think that they do it stringently enough uh they do all the
[03:19:08.520 --> 03:19:12.440]  checks on their concealed carry people on a monthly basis they make sure that
[03:19:12.440 --> 03:19:15.880]  they still haven't committed a crime that they're not under indictment etc etc
[03:19:15.880 --> 03:19:19.720]  that they're uh you know not under uh protection orders for domestic violence
[03:19:19.720 --> 03:19:22.680]  all these different things that they look for all the stuff that virginia looks
[03:19:22.680 --> 03:19:27.000]  for but they do it on a monthly basis so this is something that is a full court

[03:26:02.680 --> 03:26:06.440]  all right jacari as we're looking at this one of the things that really
[03:26:06.440 --> 03:26:09.720]  i guess today as i'm looking at all the rhetoric that really
[03:26:09.720 --> 03:26:14.760]  stuck out to me is this continual mantra about the gun lobby this the gun lobby
[03:26:14.760 --> 03:26:18.680]  that the gun lobby is and i'm looking at that and i think you know what
[03:26:18.680 --> 03:26:23.320]  what is the gun lobby well the gun lobby is things like the nra or gun owners of
[03:26:23.320 --> 03:26:27.400]  america or individuals okay who are supporting them
[03:26:27.400 --> 03:26:32.360]  all right it's really democracy in action because we've got in the marketplace
[03:26:32.360 --> 03:26:35.080]  as you're just looking at all this explosion of background checks you know
[03:26:35.080 --> 03:26:37.640]  that obama has sold more guns than anybody else
[03:26:37.640 --> 03:26:42.120]  so yes the world's best guns salesman people are voting with their pocket book
[03:26:42.120 --> 03:26:46.120]  in the marketplace they say we want guns and that's the thing david because we
[03:26:46.120 --> 03:26:49.480]  always hear nine out of ten americans want you know fewer
[03:26:49.480 --> 03:26:52.680]  guns on the street they want more background checks that's not i don't see
[03:26:52.680 --> 03:26:56.200]  that because every time every year every year every black friday every
[03:26:56.200 --> 03:26:59.160]  christmas where every whatever people go out and buy guns it's record
[03:26:59.160 --> 03:27:02.120]  numbers you can see the fbi's own numbers for that and it's new gun owners
[03:27:02.120 --> 03:27:05.960]  yeah and we're seeing that as gun ownership expands and in the areas where
[03:27:05.960 --> 03:27:08.920]  we have it we've mentioned this so many times but i'll say it one more time
[03:27:08.920 --> 03:27:13.080]  when people have guns crime goes down and we've seen that many many times
[03:27:13.080 --> 03:27:16.120]  so people are speaking out in the marketplace and they're making their
[03:27:16.120 --> 03:27:20.200]  choices they're voting in the marketplace they're also voting with their
[03:27:20.200 --> 03:27:23.560]  dollars in the marketplace of ideas that's why you have an organization
[03:27:23.560 --> 03:27:26.600]  like the nri or an organization like gun owners of america
[03:27:26.600 --> 03:27:32.440]  it's because people are voting with their dollars to support them to go try to
[03:27:32.440 --> 03:27:36.200]  maintain their freedom and the opposite of that
[03:27:36.200 --> 03:27:39.800]  is instead of the people speaking you've got one guy at the top
[03:27:39.800 --> 03:27:44.440]  obama who wants to be a dictator okay so his dictates
[03:27:44.440 --> 03:27:48.200]  should override what our elected representatives want to do in congress
[03:27:48.200 --> 03:27:52.200]  it should override our wishes in the marketplace it should override our
[03:27:52.200 --> 03:27:55.880]  wishes in the marketplace of ideas when we support these organizations so when
[03:27:55.880 --> 03:27:58.680]  they say the gun lobby this the gun lobby that
[03:27:58.680 --> 03:28:02.600]  just understand they don't like the fact that you have a say in this they want
[03:28:02.600 --> 03:28:05.000]  obama to be the only one who has a say in this
[03:28:05.000 --> 03:28:08.040]  yes and one of the things that he's had to say about he's talking about the
[03:28:08.040 --> 03:28:10.920]  smart guns guys if we can ready clip number three
[03:28:10.920 --> 03:28:14.680]  and he wants to have fingerprint activation and also gps tracking now
[03:28:14.680 --> 03:28:17.960]  on the surface for this reasonable gun control people say
[03:28:17.960 --> 03:28:22.040]  well why don't you want to have a smart gun that has a fingerprint scanner
[03:28:22.040 --> 03:28:25.320]  a child won't be able to use it i did a story a couple years back called
[03:28:25.320 --> 03:28:29.640]  uh smart guns endanger children and this is it was all about children using
[03:28:29.640 --> 03:28:32.200]  guns when they're home alone you know a 12 year old girl in
[03:28:32.200 --> 03:28:34.920]  oklahoma back in 2012 some guy breaks it to the house you
[03:28:34.920 --> 03:28:38.120]  pulls out the gun that's in her mother's name but she knew how to use it
[03:28:38.120 --> 03:28:41.800]  open fire and shout the intruder a young boy in houston 15 years old
[03:28:41.800 --> 03:28:45.000]  pulled out his father's ar-15 shot the intruder daddy wasn't home
[03:28:45.000 --> 03:28:48.840]  the boy is able to protect himself and of course as you well know jacari
[03:28:48.840 --> 03:28:52.920]  uh the more safeties you got on a gun the more likely it is in a pressure
[03:28:52.920 --> 03:28:55.720]  situation where somebody's got to drop on you that you're not going to be able to
[03:28:55.720 --> 03:28:59.160]  use it to protect yourself oh yeah there's one more thing that can go wrong
[03:28:59.160 --> 03:29:01.560]  one more step that you have to take in a vital situation
[03:29:01.560 --> 03:29:05.000]  there was a recent uh just happened over the holidays
[03:29:05.000 --> 03:29:09.000]  uh an armed robber comes up behind a guy and says uh sticks a gun in his back
[03:29:09.000 --> 03:29:11.640]  and says uh turn around and empty your pockets
[03:29:11.640 --> 03:29:14.760]  well the guy had a gun in his pocket so he did empty his pockets it's kind of
[03:29:14.760 --> 03:29:19.640]  like it's kind of like uh uh the uh true grit you know where he says uh fill
[03:29:19.640 --> 03:29:23.720]  your hands you son i'm sorry so he turned around had a gun in his hand
[03:29:23.720 --> 03:29:27.640]  and he killed the guy yeah now that's going to be counted as a death
[03:29:27.640 --> 03:29:33.400]  by fire on is that a problem i mean this guy maybe he you know he wouldn't have
[03:29:33.400 --> 03:29:36.600]  killed this individual he was robbing maybe he would have robbed
[03:29:36.600 --> 03:29:39.800]  many many other people with an armed robbery and eventually somebody would
[03:29:39.800 --> 03:29:42.360]  have done something that didn't have a gun he probably would kill them stay
[03:29:42.360 --> 03:29:45.000]  with us we're going to be right back with jacari jackson talk about this uh
[03:29:45.000 --> 03:29:52.040]  gun control by executive fiat we're on the march the empires on the run

[03:33:16.280 --> 03:33:22.680]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night here with jacari jackson
[03:33:22.680 --> 03:33:27.640]  we're taking a look at obama's moves on gun control and quite frankly
[03:33:27.640 --> 03:33:30.760]  regardless of where you are on gun control i think you should be very
[03:33:30.760 --> 03:33:34.760]  concerned about the fact that we have a i would call it a
[03:33:34.760 --> 03:33:39.000]  rump congress because there's nothing but a little stump of what it should be
[03:33:39.000 --> 03:33:42.760]  they've abdicated all their power to both the president and to these
[03:33:42.760 --> 03:33:48.120]  bureaucracies which as we see every week we have another massive power grab by
[03:33:48.120 --> 03:33:51.560]  some bureaucracy whether it's the fAA telling people you got to register your
[03:33:51.560 --> 03:33:55.560]  half pound up drones or get paper airplane yeah exactly paper register
[03:33:55.560 --> 03:34:00.680]  your paper airplane or you're going to get fine $27,500 or
[03:34:00.680 --> 03:34:05.240]  you've got the epa saying we now control all water and they come after a guy in
[03:34:05.240 --> 03:34:09.000]  in montana with eight acres who builds this little pond inside of his property
[03:34:09.000 --> 03:34:11.240]  for his livestock and his and his kids and say
[03:34:11.240 --> 03:34:14.920]  $37,000 a day fine that's something that's still
[03:34:14.920 --> 03:34:18.280]  about to roll out so every day we see these kinds of outrageous these kind of
[03:34:18.280 --> 03:34:21.960]  power grabs over the top unconstitutional actions by these
[03:34:21.960 --> 03:34:26.360]  government bureaucracies and this happens because congress has abdicated
[03:34:26.360 --> 03:34:30.200]  its power to these bureaucracies they're all these little fiefdoms looking to
[03:34:30.200 --> 03:34:33.960]  expand their power base and there are no checks on them
[03:34:33.960 --> 03:34:37.560]  they have become legislatures they have become their own police
[03:34:37.560 --> 03:34:41.560]  and their own courts because in most cases they do these as civil
[03:34:41.560 --> 03:34:45.800]  actions so you don't have a day in court in many cases they just assess you the
[03:34:45.800 --> 03:34:49.080]  fine they take your money like that not registering your
[03:34:49.080 --> 03:34:54.120]  paper airplane okay they can find you $27,000 you don't get a day in court
[03:34:54.120 --> 03:34:57.640]  okay they don't charge you it's like civil asset forfeiture under the drug
[03:34:57.640 --> 03:34:59.560]  war they don't charge you with a crime they
[03:34:59.560 --> 03:35:02.280]  don't find you guilty they just take your property
[03:35:02.280 --> 03:35:05.080]  just take your money and so that's what we're seeing over and over again and
[03:35:05.080 --> 03:35:09.080]  that's a key part of this this is the tactic that Obama is using
[03:35:09.080 --> 03:35:12.280]  to say well these are just going to be rules okay
[03:35:12.280 --> 03:35:16.200]  this is legislation without representation let's understand it it's
[03:35:16.200 --> 03:35:19.640]  gotten to that point that we need to understand this is not only
[03:35:19.640 --> 03:35:23.080]  legislation without representation we're back to taxation without representation
[03:35:23.080 --> 03:35:27.320]  when they can assess these fines as civil penalties and you don't get
[03:35:27.320 --> 03:35:31.080]  a day in court so it's very very dangerous but let's go to
[03:35:31.080 --> 03:35:35.240]  this particular clip on smart guns jacar yes let's go ahead and roll the clip
[03:35:35.240 --> 03:35:38.440]  it's uh obama's talking about smart guns and how he wants to have fingerprint
[03:35:38.440 --> 03:35:44.120]  activation to use a firearm we're going to boost gun safety technology
[03:35:44.120 --> 03:35:47.880]  now today many gun injuries and deaths are the result of legal guns that were
[03:35:47.880 --> 03:35:51.800]  stolen or misused or discharged accidentally
[03:35:51.800 --> 03:35:56.120]  in 2013 alone more than 500 people lost their lives to gun accidents and that
[03:35:56.120 --> 03:36:01.880]  includes 30 children younger than five years old and the greatest most
[03:36:01.880 --> 03:36:05.800]  technologically advanced nation on earth there is
[03:36:05.800 --> 03:36:09.480]  no reason for this we need to develop new technologies
[03:36:09.480 --> 03:36:14.920]  that make guns safer if we can set it up so you can't unlock your phone
[03:36:14.920 --> 03:36:18.920]  unless you got the right fingerprint
[03:36:20.360 --> 03:36:23.880]  why can't we do the same thing for our guns
[03:36:23.880 --> 03:36:28.280]  yeah great let's do it let's treat everybody as if they're a
[03:36:28.280 --> 03:36:31.720]  convicted drunk driver and they've got to pass a breathalyzer test to turn on
[03:36:31.720 --> 03:36:35.240]  their car that can help us find a missing tablet
[03:36:35.240 --> 03:36:40.920]  which happens to me often the older i get
[03:36:45.480 --> 03:36:49.640]  if we can do it for your ipad there's no reason we can't do it
[03:36:49.640 --> 03:36:54.760]  with a stolen gun if a child can't open a bottle aspirin yeah let's go ahead and
[03:36:54.760 --> 03:36:57.320]  stop the clip there yeah when you're talking about gps tracking it's like
[03:36:57.320 --> 03:37:00.680]  hey sometimes i lose my ipad and i need gps tracking to find it
[03:37:00.680 --> 03:37:05.000]  it's like oh yeah we're gonna put that 38 i can't find it let me yeah yeah and
[03:37:05.000 --> 03:37:06.920]  that's one thing that's not what they're gonna use
[03:37:06.920 --> 03:37:09.000]  attorney general was talking about before he
[03:37:09.000 --> 03:37:12.120]  went out he said well let's have some type of bracelet or some other thing
[03:37:12.120 --> 03:37:15.640]  to where people can't use the gun unless they're right there and i mean
[03:37:15.640 --> 03:37:19.160]  it's going to happen you know if they make this nationwide it's going to i'm
[03:37:19.160 --> 03:37:21.640]  unfortunately it's going to happen an officer is going to reach for his gun
[03:37:21.640 --> 03:37:24.600]  he's going to have some gloves on or some other thing and he's not going to use
[03:37:24.600 --> 03:37:27.240]  this pistol oh technology never fails to car
[03:37:27.240 --> 03:37:30.840]  oh yeah just like a smart car never gets you a ticket or anything that's right
[03:37:30.840 --> 03:37:33.240]  look look we have we understand where this is going
[03:37:33.240 --> 03:37:38.040]  we know one of our big concerns about the government controlled robot cars let's
[03:37:38.040 --> 03:37:39.960]  just understand that it's going to be the government that's going to be
[03:37:39.960 --> 03:37:43.000]  controlling them they can shut down your transportation just like that
[03:37:43.000 --> 03:37:45.880]  with this they'll be able to track you anywhere they want they'll be able to
[03:37:45.880 --> 03:37:49.080]  turn off your guns remotely and not just the government hackers will be able to
[03:37:49.080 --> 03:37:52.040]  mess with your guns okay and turn them off and it
[03:37:52.040 --> 03:37:55.960]  is another level of safety but this is something they're really going to push
[03:37:55.960 --> 03:38:00.680]  listen to what he said in his uh this is the white house talking about what
[03:38:00.680 --> 03:38:03.320]  they're going to do he says they're going to review the availability of smart
[03:38:03.320 --> 03:38:08.040]  gun technology on a regular basis they're going to explore potential ways to
[03:38:08.040 --> 03:38:12.600]  further its use and development to more broadly improve gun safety well
[03:38:12.600 --> 03:38:15.960]  they're going to embark on a on a research program
[03:38:15.960 --> 03:38:20.040]  to come up with this stuff and then force you to use that
[03:38:20.040 --> 03:38:23.480]  they're also going to set up an internet investigation center to track
[03:38:23.480 --> 03:38:26.200]  illegal online firearms tracking and of course
[03:38:26.200 --> 03:38:30.120]  they're moving some of this power jacari from the fbi to the atf
[03:38:30.120 --> 03:38:33.400]  background checks they're moving some of that to the atf
[03:38:33.400 --> 03:38:37.960]  this internet investigation center another agency to spy on you on the
[03:38:37.960 --> 03:38:42.280]  internet okay without a search warrant they're going to be transferring that to
[03:38:42.280 --> 03:38:46.040]  the atf instead of the fbi i guess the fbi is a little bit
[03:38:46.040 --> 03:38:48.200]  too concerned for the about the constitution they don't have that
[03:38:48.200 --> 03:38:50.840]  problem with the b atf
[03:38:50.840 --> 03:38:54.280]  yeah i guess that's a good way to put it now there's another thing that he
[03:38:54.280 --> 03:38:56.840]  talked about in clip number two guys if we can get that ready
[03:38:56.840 --> 03:39:00.520]  uh when he's talking talking about gun trust you may recall david uh jill big
[03:39:00.520 --> 03:39:03.880]  so myself we did that report we went out to the silencer shop here
[03:39:03.880 --> 03:39:06.440]  in austin texas and one of the things that they were talking about you could
[03:39:06.440 --> 03:39:09.720]  use you could use a trust to have multiple people use a silent or
[03:39:09.720 --> 03:39:12.840]  suppressor you know they call silencer but it's really a suppressor
[03:39:12.840 --> 03:39:16.280]  it makes the gun hearing safe it can also help you know somebody with their
[03:39:16.280 --> 03:39:19.320]  accuracy and people complain about these suppressors i'm like
[03:39:19.320 --> 03:39:22.280]  all these people who complain about getting shot by somebody what don't you
[03:39:22.280 --> 03:39:25.880]  want the person to be more accurate and actually hit the bad guy hit the target
[03:39:25.880 --> 03:39:29.160]  and if a suppressor can help you do that what's the argument against that
[03:39:29.160 --> 03:39:32.200]  that's common sense to me yeah make the gun more accurate that that's common
[03:39:32.200 --> 03:39:35.160]  sense oh yeah yeah absolutely well you know this this
[03:39:35.160 --> 03:39:40.360]  ammunition law that was put in out in like they're trying to float this out in
[03:39:40.360 --> 03:39:43.800]  new york the two women who did this in the state
[03:39:43.800 --> 03:39:47.640]  house and the state senate they wanted to limit
[03:39:47.640 --> 03:39:51.160]  your ammunition purchases to twice the capacity of your firearm during a
[03:39:51.160 --> 03:39:53.800]  three-month period so if they do that if they were successful in doing that that
[03:39:53.800 --> 03:39:57.800]  would mean that you would not be able to practice with it so that you had real
[03:39:57.800 --> 03:40:01.560]  gun control okay so that you could really hit gun control is using both hands
[03:40:01.560 --> 03:40:04.280]  that's right that's right and of course they point out that this is already
[03:40:04.280 --> 03:40:07.240]  failed they had a provision for that in the safe
[03:40:07.240 --> 03:40:10.600]  act that was passed in new york state and they were
[03:40:10.600 --> 03:40:15.080]  very embarrassed when governor Cuomo realized that he didn't have any way to
[03:40:15.080 --> 03:40:19.080]  implement that and then it was also overturned in federal district court in
[03:40:19.080 --> 03:40:21.960]  new york they said it was unconstitutional to
[03:40:21.960 --> 03:40:24.360]  regulate how many rounds a person can have but
[03:40:24.360 --> 03:40:28.360]  that doesn't uh that doesn't faze uh roxanne and joanne the two
[03:40:28.360 --> 03:40:31.480]  legislators who are pushing this thing they're gonna still try to do that again
[03:40:31.480 --> 03:40:35.560]  and understand they are going to try to control ammunition he doesn't talk
[03:40:35.560 --> 03:40:38.360]  about that but that's one of the key things because if they can get a hold of
[03:40:38.360 --> 03:40:41.880]  your ammunition then your gun becomes a club
[03:40:41.880 --> 03:40:46.120]  absolutely let's go ahead and run that clip about targeting the gun trust
[03:40:46.120 --> 03:40:49.560]  we're also expanding background checks to cover violent criminals
[03:40:49.560 --> 03:40:53.400]  who try to buy some of the most dangerous firearms by hiding behind trusts
[03:40:53.400 --> 03:40:58.440]  and corporations and various cutouts
[03:40:58.440 --> 03:41:03.320]  that's also taking steps to make the background check system
[03:41:03.320 --> 03:41:09.000]  more efficient under the guidance of jim combi and the fbi
[03:41:09.000 --> 03:41:12.760]  and our deputy director and tom brandon at
[03:41:12.760 --> 03:41:19.080]  a f atf we're going to hire more folks to process applications faster and we're
[03:41:19.080 --> 03:41:24.680]  going to bring an outdated background check system into the 21st century
[03:41:24.680 --> 03:41:31.240]  so there we go let's get rid of gun trust and as you said david uh you know
[03:41:31.240 --> 03:41:34.280]  some violent felon isn't going to go through the process of trying to get
[03:41:34.280 --> 03:41:38.440]  into a trust in the first place that's right that's right it's a very
[03:41:38.440 --> 03:41:43.160]  you know i mean really is our the typical street criminals are they going
[03:41:43.160 --> 03:41:46.600]  to go through all the hassle of trying to set up a gun trust that's the
[03:41:46.600 --> 03:41:50.520]  absurdity of all of this stuff yes the fact that if you're going to be engaged
[03:41:50.520 --> 03:41:53.960]  in a criminal activity the last thing you're going to do
[03:41:53.960 --> 03:41:58.360]  is go buy a gun at a retail facility okay and if they're going to crack down on
[03:41:58.360 --> 03:42:03.000]  that i can just imagine that the the armed robbers and the armed terrorists
[03:42:03.000 --> 03:42:05.720]  are going to say you know well we're going to have to put off our
[03:42:05.720 --> 03:42:08.680]  our heist here we're going to put off the terrorist event because they were out
[03:42:08.680 --> 03:42:13.240]  of ammunition at walmart or you know they were out of ak-47s or whatever
[03:42:13.240 --> 03:42:17.160]  i mean they don't they don't use that uh they're going to go through the black
[03:42:17.160 --> 03:42:20.680]  market and the black market is going to be there if we haven't learned anything
[03:42:20.680 --> 03:42:24.840]  from the war on drugs can't we learn something from
[03:42:24.840 --> 03:42:28.520]  alcohol prohibition and that is when you prohibit something
[03:42:28.520 --> 03:42:34.360]  you have a vibrant black market okay we have more access to drugs because of
[03:42:34.360 --> 03:42:36.920]  prohibition i've talked to law enforcement against prohibition that
[03:42:36.920 --> 03:42:40.840]  organization leap they pointed that out it's like it's actually makes it
[03:42:40.840 --> 03:42:44.520]  more readily available it increases the virility of whatever it is that you're
[03:42:44.520 --> 03:42:48.120]  trying to outlaw so you're gonna have much more dangerous forms of guns
[03:42:48.120 --> 03:42:52.120]  that are going to be more widely available as you continue to crack
[03:42:52.120 --> 03:42:55.960]  down on this yeah and as far as we're talking about prohibition go talk to a
[03:42:55.960 --> 03:42:59.320]  high school senior it's easier for them to get some illegal drugs than is to get
[03:42:59.320 --> 03:43:03.000]  a can of beer that's right exactly exactly that's the whole point
[03:43:03.000 --> 03:43:06.120]  so if we can learn anything from this can't we learn that
[03:43:06.120 --> 03:43:09.720]  uh prohibition is going to backfire on us and that's what the
[03:43:09.720 --> 03:43:12.360]  the people who are pushing for gun control need to understand that they
[03:43:12.360 --> 03:43:16.440]  also need to understand that if you're going to support a process by which
[03:43:16.440 --> 03:43:20.040]  we have these agencies do whatever they wish where the president can do
[03:43:20.040 --> 03:43:24.200]  whatever he wishes as a dictator there's going to be somebody coming along
[03:43:24.200 --> 03:43:27.240]  eventually that you're not going to be happy with and unfortunately that's
[03:43:27.240 --> 03:43:31.160]  one of the reasons why the opposition party never shuts this down
[03:43:31.160 --> 03:43:35.480]  the democrats don't shut down a republican when he makes a bad executive
[03:43:35.480 --> 03:43:37.960]  orders and the republicans don't shut down obama
[03:43:37.960 --> 03:43:42.200]  because they want that power themselves and that ought to scare you
[03:43:42.200 --> 03:43:45.560]  more than the idea that your neighbor has a gun
[03:43:45.560 --> 03:43:48.680]  that really ought to scare you a lot more than that absolutely now let's play
[03:43:48.680 --> 03:43:51.080]  the the next clip let's go to clip number one guys
[03:43:51.080 --> 03:43:55.000]  and this is obama saying anyone in the business of selling firearms must get a
[03:43:55.000 --> 03:43:57.720]  license and perform a background check now this
[03:43:57.720 --> 03:44:01.160]  troubles me david because just as a kid was saying today when he's talking to
[03:44:01.160 --> 03:44:04.200]  alex that means if i sold you a firearm
[03:44:04.200 --> 03:44:08.040]  you know am i a licensed dealer no but i have the right as a united states
[03:44:08.040 --> 03:44:11.640]  citizen to sell you a firearm without any type of background check or having a
[03:44:11.640 --> 03:44:15.640]  license now obama referenced people selling firearms over the internet
[03:44:15.640 --> 03:44:18.680]  ffl dealers without any type of background checks in my understanding
[03:44:18.680 --> 03:44:22.840]  that's illegal activity for a ffl dealer to do that but as private
[03:44:22.840 --> 03:44:26.600]  individuals private citizens we can perform activity a transaction right
[03:44:26.600 --> 03:44:29.400]  now if we wanted to well if you're buying something over the internet
[03:44:29.400 --> 03:44:33.560]  yeah you can buy a gun over the internet it has to be shipped to an ffl dealer
[03:44:33.560 --> 03:44:37.800]  and he's going to do the same process on you as if you're buying it in his store
[03:44:37.800 --> 03:44:42.040]  he will charge you a flat fee most cases around here is like 25 bucks or whatever
[03:44:42.040 --> 03:44:45.720]  he'll charge you that 25 over the price of what you paid for
[03:44:45.720 --> 03:44:49.080]  the gun on the internet but it is coming through him
[03:44:49.080 --> 03:44:52.280]  he's doing all the process as if he was selling you a gun retail
[03:44:52.280 --> 03:44:55.640]  so when they talk about they're going to set up this internet
[03:44:55.640 --> 03:44:59.000]  snitching agency and run it underneath the atf i mean
[03:44:59.000 --> 03:45:02.680]  none of this stuff none of these measures are relevant to
[03:45:02.680 --> 03:45:06.520]  any of the so-called situations that they've had
[03:45:06.520 --> 03:45:10.120]  okay they say this is a reaction to this are going to stop this from happening
[03:45:10.120 --> 03:45:13.560]  it's not going to make any difference whatsoever not to any of these specific
[03:45:13.560 --> 03:45:16.680]  cases and he's doing this even though as kept
[03:45:16.680 --> 03:45:19.560]  daniels pointed out only two percent of the people
[03:45:19.560 --> 03:45:22.920]  support gun control is a top issue i mean just recently there was another
[03:45:22.920 --> 03:45:25.400]  poll i believe it was three percent of the people
[03:45:25.400 --> 03:45:29.640]  in america saw climate change as a problem so here's obama
[03:45:29.640 --> 03:45:34.040]  you know he's going to go against 97 or 98 percent of the people
[03:45:34.040 --> 03:45:37.480]  constantly and he's doing it according to cnn because
[03:45:37.480 --> 03:45:42.520]  he's gone through an emotional evolution on on one issue they say he gets into
[03:45:42.520 --> 03:45:45.160]  this deeply personally and that's the way
[03:45:45.160 --> 03:45:49.720]  they're selling this tearful uh when he starts crying about this
[03:45:49.720 --> 03:45:53.480]  let's cry for all the people in syria and yemen and make their lives because
[03:45:53.480 --> 03:45:55.800]  of your policies let's go ahead and run this clip from
[03:45:55.800 --> 03:46:00.760]  president obama anybody in the business of selling firearms
[03:46:00.760 --> 03:46:05.000]  must get a license and conduct background checks or be subject to criminal
[03:46:05.000 --> 03:46:07.800]  prosecutions
[03:46:18.760 --> 03:46:21.640]  it doesn't matter whether you're doing it over the internet
[03:46:21.640 --> 03:46:28.360]  or at a gun show it's not where you do it but what you do
[03:46:28.360 --> 03:46:32.040]  and once again they keep talking about this gun show loophole i've purchased
[03:46:32.040 --> 03:46:35.400]  firearms at gun shows every single time i've gone through a background check
[03:46:35.400 --> 03:46:38.600]  yeah yeah so there's a mass of people who don't
[03:46:38.600 --> 03:46:42.280]  understand that last year we had 23 million background checks performed
[03:46:42.280 --> 03:46:45.560]  they hear the speeches like this they think everybody who goes to a gun show
[03:46:45.560 --> 03:46:48.680]  or anyplace else just goes in their hands a guy you know a couple hundred bucks
[03:46:48.680 --> 03:46:52.280]  walks out with a firearm those people they know that they have you know atf and
[03:46:52.280 --> 03:46:55.400]  other guys who come into those facilities looking for those type of
[03:46:55.400 --> 03:46:59.000]  situations those guys at gun shows are very stringent they want to check your
[03:46:59.000 --> 03:47:01.800]  id they call the fbi the nick system whatever they
[03:47:01.800 --> 03:47:05.560]  have to do to verify your identity before they hand you that
[03:47:05.560 --> 03:47:09.320]  firearm yeah when i've been to gun shows they've actually been
[03:47:09.320 --> 03:47:12.520]  more concerned about that kind of stuff than the people in the gun stores
[03:47:12.520 --> 03:47:14.840]  because as you pointed out they know there are people
[03:47:14.840 --> 03:47:18.360]  going around and trying to set them up for something so that's
[03:47:18.360 --> 03:47:22.920]  that's clearly the case now you know it's just i don't know as we look at this
[03:47:22.920 --> 03:47:25.400]  one of the things that people were concerned about was that he was going
[03:47:25.400 --> 03:47:28.760]  to outlaw a private sale transaction although you and i
[03:47:28.760 --> 03:47:33.880]  uh you selling unto me or vice versa uh they're saying that this does not cover
[03:47:33.880 --> 03:47:36.440]  that that's what they're currently saying right now but of course he can
[03:47:36.440 --> 03:47:38.920]  easily change he's establishing the precedent
[03:47:38.920 --> 03:47:42.760]  that he can do whatever he wishes regardless of what our elected
[03:47:42.760 --> 03:47:46.040]  representatives say regardless of the will of the people
[03:47:46.040 --> 03:47:49.720]  regardless of the constitution that protects our individual rights he can
[03:47:49.720 --> 03:47:53.560]  override any of this so he's establishing a precedent establishing a
[03:47:53.560 --> 03:47:57.480]  principle on this particular issue that he can do whatever he wishes because
[03:47:57.480 --> 03:48:01.320]  he's not happy with the constitution or with congress or with our wishes as a
[03:48:01.320 --> 03:48:03.960]  people yeah even if that's not what the president
[03:48:03.960 --> 03:48:07.560]  is saying in this particular instance we've seen multiple politicians from
[03:48:07.560 --> 03:48:10.280]  around the country in various offices saying that
[03:48:10.280 --> 03:48:13.720]  they would have you have to go through a background check to sell
[03:48:13.720 --> 03:48:17.640]  a firearm to your son you know if you wanted to sell sell travis a gun
[03:48:17.640 --> 03:48:20.600]  yeah you'd have to go through some type of background check so even if that's
[03:48:20.600 --> 03:48:24.760]  not what obama's pushing right here we also see several politicians
[03:48:24.760 --> 03:48:27.960]  using me who are ready to jump on that train exactly and when we're looking at
[03:48:27.960 --> 03:48:32.200]  the gun trust issue again that is a complicated legal structure that
[03:48:32.200 --> 03:48:36.680]  people will go through so that you can have multiple people using this
[03:48:36.680 --> 03:48:41.000]  typically in a family that are using this particular firearms so they can't
[03:48:41.000 --> 03:48:44.760]  play this game of the gun is then this guy's hand
[03:48:44.760 --> 03:48:49.480]  as opposed to your hand so they're going through a very detail very complicated
[03:48:49.480 --> 03:48:52.600]  structure here that doesn't still doesn't change anything about the way the gun
[03:48:52.600 --> 03:48:56.360]  is bought you still have background checks regardless of whether it's going
[03:48:56.360 --> 03:49:00.120]  to be registered to one individual or whether it's being registered to a gun
[03:49:00.120 --> 03:49:03.480]  trust it is still going through those background checks
[03:49:03.480 --> 03:49:06.680]  yeah and that's the thing i don't think people understand you know that they
[03:49:06.680 --> 03:49:09.240]  hear the rhetoric but they just don't understand their
[03:49:09.240 --> 03:49:11.960]  they they are concerned i believe there are plenty of people out there
[03:49:11.960 --> 03:49:15.880]  who are legitimately concerned about the gun violence in this country and like
[03:49:15.880 --> 03:49:18.920]  so i don't like to see the gun violence either but people need to understand
[03:49:18.920 --> 03:49:22.840]  when you see these statistics of you know x number of people died in 2015
[03:49:22.840 --> 03:49:27.000]  those include suicides people commit suicide by jumping in front of trains
[03:49:27.000 --> 03:49:30.680]  jumping off buildings a guy died accidentally i believe in san diego
[03:49:30.680 --> 03:49:34.360]  taking a selfie are you going to outlaw a lot of people taking selfies absolutely
[03:49:34.360 --> 03:49:37.720]  not also people commit suicide they commit suicide they uh
[03:49:37.720 --> 03:49:42.040]  they get shot by police officers tell me officer shootings whether they be justified or
[03:49:42.040 --> 03:49:46.120]  unjustified uh fall into that category as well so when you see this all consuming
[03:49:46.120 --> 03:49:49.240]  number people just automatically assume they're all school shootings or they're
[03:49:49.240 --> 03:49:52.440]  all other things no sometimes it's a store clerk
[03:49:52.440 --> 03:49:55.960]  shooting a robber who comes into their into their establishment
[03:49:55.960 --> 03:50:00.040]  let's talk about this other aspect of this and of course that is the snitch
[03:50:00.040 --> 03:50:04.760]  society that we're creating here in the united states snitches of america
[03:50:04.760 --> 03:50:07.960]  we've seen this happen with syssa recently they tried
[03:50:07.960 --> 03:50:12.840]  several times to pass different acts they had acta pippa they had syspa
[03:50:12.840 --> 03:50:15.560]  several different times they went through they took off
[03:50:15.560 --> 03:50:21.240]  the p in syspa and now it is now syssa exactly the same thing the p was about
[03:50:21.240 --> 03:50:24.040]  protection and what were they doing with protection they haven't removed the
[03:50:24.040 --> 03:50:27.080]  protection the whole point of syspa and the whole
[03:50:27.080 --> 03:50:31.960]  point of syssa which is now passed is to remove legal liability
[03:50:31.960 --> 03:50:36.040]  from people who snitch on you co corporations who do that they want to
[03:50:36.040 --> 03:50:40.120]  actively encourage that now they want to actively encourage
[03:50:40.120 --> 03:50:45.160]  all medical professionals to snitch on you you have to look at this as not
[03:50:45.160 --> 03:50:48.680]  about gun confiscation this is about privacy confiscation
[03:50:48.680 --> 03:50:51.720]  confiscation is about confiscating your consent
[03:50:51.720 --> 03:50:55.000]  and they're also coming after the baby boomers this is gun control for baby
[03:50:55.000 --> 03:50:58.600]  boomers we'll be right back stay with us

[03:55:16.440 --> 03:55:20.280]  discount now jacquard as we were talking just before we went to break
[03:55:20.280 --> 03:55:24.120]  uh they're going to essentially come after our privacy
[03:55:24.120 --> 03:55:27.960]  they're going to come after our consent in the 1993 brady law
[03:55:27.960 --> 03:55:31.560]  uh it prohibited gun ownership by individuals who had been involuntarily
[03:55:31.560 --> 03:55:34.280]  committed who had been found incompetent to stand trial
[03:55:34.280 --> 03:55:38.120]  who were deemed by court to be dangerous to themselves or others that's a
[03:55:38.120 --> 03:55:42.600]  type of thing but it prohibited doctors and other healthcare providers
[03:55:42.600 --> 03:55:47.080]  from violating the confidentiality of doctor patient relationships but of
[03:55:47.080 --> 03:55:49.720]  course nothing is confidential anymore they have
[03:55:49.720 --> 03:55:52.920]  absolutely nothing but contempt for our consent
[03:55:52.920 --> 03:55:56.840]  contempt for our privacy and that's what we see now in this new law just like
[03:55:56.840 --> 03:55:59.080]  they did with the syspa act they encouraged

[03:56:27.960 --> 03:56:30.760]  rights due to executive order and this is exactly what you're talking about
[03:56:30.760 --> 03:56:33.960]  david if you go to see your healthcare professional and maybe you're just
[03:56:33.960 --> 03:56:36.840]  talking you maybe fell off your bike right you hurt your leg and they just
[03:56:36.840 --> 03:56:39.160]  ask you what do you think about the government you say well i don't like the
[03:56:39.160 --> 03:56:42.760]  nsa spying on me well that's the oppositional defiant disorder and by
[03:56:42.760 --> 03:56:46.920]  the dsm they say that that is a mental disorder and now you
[03:56:46.920 --> 03:56:49.880]  got that in spades i haven't been to a
[03:56:49.880 --> 03:56:53.480]  i haven't been to a psychologist and been officially diagnosed with
[03:56:53.480 --> 03:56:58.200]  odd and you know they they crafted that acronym to call us odd right okay but
[03:56:58.200 --> 03:57:01.960]  it's anybody who doesn't like uh out of control authority
[03:57:01.960 --> 03:57:06.360]  okay or or i guess you should say what i don't like are people who
[03:57:06.360 --> 03:57:09.400]  act as if they have authority when they don't have authority and that's what
[03:57:09.400 --> 03:57:13.000]  we're seeing here with these gun control edicts from obama
[03:57:13.000 --> 03:57:16.840]  he has uh he has gone beyond the authority that he has i mean the king of
[03:57:16.840 --> 03:57:19.320]  this country let's put it this way the king of this country
[03:57:19.320 --> 03:57:23.560]  is the constitution lex rex okay is a latin phrase for that
[03:57:23.560 --> 03:57:27.000]  these guys are nothing but temporary stewards but they're acting as if they're
[03:57:27.000 --> 03:57:29.800]  the kings they're acting as if they're dictators they can do anything that they
[03:57:29.800 --> 03:57:32.760]  want and they have completely subverted uh the
[03:57:32.760 --> 03:57:35.720]  constitutional republic that we have here but they're constitutional lawyers
[03:57:35.720 --> 03:57:38.920]  david they know how to interpret he knows exactly what he's doing right
[03:57:38.920 --> 03:57:42.680]  that's right he knows exactly now kit daniels put up an article uh just
[03:57:42.680 --> 03:57:46.280]  just now came in and gave this to us obama bans himself from buying guns
[03:57:46.280 --> 03:57:50.200]  question mark shrink had suggested that the president himself
[03:57:50.200 --> 03:57:55.720]  may be mentally ill so all he needs is just one individual to uh to flag him
[03:57:55.720 --> 03:57:58.520]  like that with an opinion then he couldn't get guns but he doesn't need guns
[03:57:58.520 --> 03:58:02.520]  jacari he's got an army of people he's got secret service yeah that's right
[03:58:02.520 --> 03:58:05.320]  it's kind of like you know the old mafia dons they don't carry the gun because
[03:58:05.320 --> 03:58:08.840]  they got you know 20 guys standing behind them that's right yeah so he doesn't
[03:58:08.840 --> 03:58:13.000]  need him and he's not going to let you protect yourself from criminals or from
[03:58:13.000 --> 03:58:16.600]  the government if need be so that's what this is all about thanks for joining us
