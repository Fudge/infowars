[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[00:05.000 --> 00:09.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:09.000 --> 00:31.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:31.000 --> 00:41.000]  Well, Bloomberg Financial reported yesterday that the bailout is now over $7 trillion.
[00:41.000 --> 00:49.000]  So, in the last week, an additional $2 trillion has been stolen by the private bankers.
[00:49.000 --> 00:56.000]  Now, understand, they're not just stealing the money, you're going to pay for it with taxes.
[00:56.000 --> 01:07.000]  And that's why they are handing out radar guns and firearms and just all sorts of new equipment to the general public to spy on the rest of the public.
[01:07.000 --> 01:19.000]  They are going to hire millions and millions of citizens to mug the rest of the population. It is going to be bad.
[01:19.000 --> 01:28.000]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen, we're live. It is the 25th day of November, 2008, on this Tuesday edition.
[01:28.000 --> 01:35.000]  No guest today, but I will be airing the audio of Ron Paul's speech at the end of the Fed rally Saturday in Houston.
[01:35.000 --> 01:48.000]  I'll be airing some clips of myself and others, including Ron Paul's brother, Wayne Paul, who was at the Dallas demonstration there at the real source of all of our major financial problems.
[01:48.000 --> 01:52.000]  The head of the snake of the New World Order. So, that is coming up.
[01:52.000 --> 02:00.000]  I'll give you a report as well on the 45th anniversary of the murder of JFK in Dealey Plaza and what we witnessed there.
[02:00.000 --> 02:10.000]  So, kind of a double header, killing two birds with one stone, pun intended, up there in Dallas, Texas this weekend and yesterday.
[02:10.000 --> 02:21.000]  Interviewing Robert Rodin, Jim Mars and others for the JFK film and the Barack Obama police state film that we are making right now.
[02:21.000 --> 02:36.000]  So, seven plus billion dollars, seven plus billion. We'll be reading that report for you here today.
[02:36.000 --> 02:43.000]  Seven billion, excuse me, seven trillion, my mind can't even get around it.
[02:43.000 --> 02:46.000]  I apologize, I was just saying billion over and over again.
[02:46.000 --> 03:01.000]  7.4 trillion, 7.4 trillion, 7.4 trillion, excuse me, 7.4 trillion.
[03:01.000 --> 03:06.000]  And now they're saying, oh, we are going to bail out the mortgage holders.
[03:06.000 --> 03:16.000]  But then when you read the fine print of what Paulson proposed and I have it here in front of me, it says mortgage backed securities.
[03:16.000 --> 03:20.000]  So, it's the derivatives held by the international banks.
[03:20.000 --> 03:28.000]  Look, let me just give the public something. You're not getting anything but taxes and regulation and a billy club upside the head, okay?
[03:28.000 --> 03:36.000]  The people running this country have attacked hundreds of other nations and killed tens of millions of people.
[03:36.000 --> 03:42.000]  Tens of millions. They've killed over a million and a half Iraqis in the last five and a half years, okay?
[03:42.000 --> 03:46.000]  I know I keep making that point. They don't care about you.
[03:46.000 --> 03:54.000]  All they want to do is smile at you and have their talking heads tell you that, you know, driving home from Dallas last night to Austin.
[03:54.000 --> 04:03.000]  Half the billboards were tattle on poachers, tattle on drug users, fund the CPS, be proud of public schools.
[04:03.000 --> 04:12.000]  You know, just all government PR, government propaganda, don't spank your child, report illegal guns.
[04:12.000 --> 04:18.000]  I mean, I'm living in 1984. That's what the billboards are now because everything is the government.
[04:18.000 --> 04:28.000]  No one can really afford to pay for billboards anymore. And so the government will take our tax money and put up propaganda.
[04:28.000 --> 04:33.000]  All right, my head's just spinning, ladies and gentlemen. There is just so much coming up today.
[04:33.000 --> 04:41.000]  They are now going to put cameras in new parents' homes, the CPS is, to make sure there's a presumption of guilt.
[04:41.000 --> 04:49.000]  You're guilty until proven innocent, no judge, no jury, no due process, just the eugenics arm. And so that's in the news.
[04:49.000 --> 05:12.000]  Yes, it's all here. It's all happening.
[05:19.000 --> 05:44.000]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[05:44.000 --> 05:53.000]  IONICZONE.com or toll-free 800-549-9535 IONICZONE.
[05:53.000 --> 06:00.000]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job.
[06:00.000 --> 06:03.000]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[06:03.000 --> 06:10.000]  I'll do the American people know that 9-11 was a state. It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the fallout or commission, the CAFR.
[06:10.000 --> 06:19.000]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of just criticism to grow at our own door.
[06:19.000 --> 06:25.000]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[06:25.000 --> 06:32.000]  An inside job? How dare you?
[06:32.000 --> 06:35.000]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[06:35.000 --> 06:40.000]  Well, Helen, it's breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[06:40.000 --> 06:44.000]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[06:44.000 --> 06:50.000]  Truth rise. Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[06:50.000 --> 06:55.000]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[06:55.000 --> 07:04.000]  We have a new president coming into office in January. His number one word of use is change. What if the change was not the change America expected?
[07:04.000 --> 07:09.000]  What if all natural products were handed over to the pharmaceutical companies to be eradicated?
[07:09.000 --> 07:14.000]  What if the only remedy for sickness and disease was to take drugs?
[07:14.000 --> 07:17.000]  This hasn't happened yet, I repeat, not yet.

[08:17.000 --> 08:28.000]  Big success all across the nation in 38 locations. Hands off to everybody involved as we identify the real enemy and even got some mainstream media coverage.
[08:28.000 --> 08:39.000]  But the key is all over YouTube, Google, and other video sites, there are just hundreds and hundreds of videos from all over the nation, scores of videos per demonstration.
[08:39.000 --> 08:48.000]  And that's the key. It's the activists going out, protesting, demonstrating, and then putting on the web to magnify it so people can see the action that's being taken
[08:48.000 --> 08:54.000]  and learn about the fact that the private Federal Reserve is the organization running this country.
[08:54.000 --> 09:06.000]  It is the regional governorship. It is the section office, the governorship, the viceroy office of the New World Order here in the United States.
[09:06.000 --> 09:16.000]  Let me just run through the headlines here. And what's so shocking, what I thought of this morning when I read this, when Curtin M. O. emailed it to me.
[09:16.000 --> 09:26.000]  He's on a story on it. It's uponinfowars.com, was, this doesn't even shock me now.
[09:26.000 --> 09:36.000]  I've known for so long they were secretly planning this, secretly preparing it, and then in the last 10 years or so, brainwashing the public to accept it,
[09:36.000 --> 09:42.000]  that when you finally see it openly being announced, it doesn't have the effect it should.
[09:42.000 --> 09:50.000]  And that's something we should be aware of, that we get fatigued, we get acclimated and prepared to accept this.
[09:50.000 --> 09:59.000]  This is a very big deal. CBS News. This is nationalcbsnews.cbsnews.com. Military examines role in domestic defense,
[09:59.000 --> 10:13.000]  and they come into this article and lie and say, oh, we just now got this idea because of a government report that we're not going to be safe unless the army is on the streets of America.
[10:13.000 --> 10:22.000]  Now, again, when this was completely illegal, and still illegal, they haven't fully overturned bossy commentatus, there were Marines and army in police uniforms,
[10:22.000 --> 10:38.000]  coast to coast doing raids on gun owners' homes, and on drug houses as well, in Norfolk, Virginia, in Dallas, Texas, in Tucson, Arizona, in Los Angeles, county,
[10:38.000 --> 10:45.000]  in New York City, in Detroit, Michigan, many other areas that, those are areas we documented and got documents and eyewitnesses,
[10:45.000 --> 10:50.000]  and I covered that in my film seven years ago, Road to Tyranny.
[10:50.000 --> 10:57.000]  I mean, everything we told you is happening. Do you understand? The rest is going to happen, unless we stop it.
[10:57.000 --> 11:01.000]  People say, well, why gloom and doom? Why not be positive, Alex?
[11:01.000 --> 11:08.000]  We are positively with courage here on the air telling you who runs the planet, who runs the country, that they're bad people,
[11:08.000 --> 11:17.000]  and the solution is saying this is an illegitimate criminal out of control government, and then you the people, we the people, myself, you, everybody listening,
[11:17.000 --> 11:26.000]  and others finally get serious and get focused and say no, because they're not going to stop until we say no.
[11:26.000 --> 11:36.000]  They are turning up the propaganda on radio, TV, newspapers, billboards, schools, it's just brainwashing everywhere, and the good news is it's not working,
[11:36.000 --> 11:42.000]  but they don't care. They're in control, so they just move forward.
[11:42.000 --> 11:49.000]  People say, well, what are solutions to this? The solution is to wake the people up, to explain to them.
[11:49.000 --> 11:53.000]  The solution is to know the enemy battle plan that is the enemy,
[11:53.000 --> 11:59.000]  whether you're in the military or the police or the FBI or the government as a bureaucrat, you can look at what's going on and say,
[11:59.000 --> 12:04.000]  should I be with the people or with this government? Is this government legitimate?
[12:04.000 --> 12:09.000]  Or is it just basically a receivership arm for foreign private banks?
[12:09.000 --> 12:22.000]  I mean, $7.4 trillion now stolen? Bloomberg? $7.4 trillion in six weeks? Do you know what this means?
[12:22.000 --> 12:32.000]  And you know, a lot of the public is worried about the future, but they don't have any idea how bad it is.
[12:32.000 --> 12:39.000]  I mean, I don't even know what to say anymore.
[12:39.000 --> 12:44.000]  I can't believe this is happening, even though I knew they were planning it and setting it up and saying they were going to do it.
[12:44.000 --> 12:52.000]  I mean, all we're doing is covering what they said in their own white papers and government documents they were going to do, and we provide them every day and link to the documents.
[12:52.000 --> 12:58.000]  And then people will come in on the comment sections of the stories and say, I want to see proof when it's right there for you.
[12:58.000 --> 13:05.000]  Proof? Everything we've said has happened.
[13:05.000 --> 13:09.000]  And I know most of those people are operatives doing that, and I don't know how those operatives do that.
[13:09.000 --> 13:19.000]  I mean, how do you do that just for a little bit of money, a paycheck, completely sell your country up to really bad people?
[13:19.000 --> 13:26.000]  I mean, I've got folks still denying that Northcom announced they were going to put not one, not two, not three, not four.
[13:26.000 --> 13:35.000]  If you read it, it's more than seven brigades and a whole bunch of different units from every branch of the armed services.
[13:35.000 --> 13:41.000]  On the streets, folks, do you know why they're doing that? Why they've been setting that up quietly for decades?
[13:41.000 --> 13:46.000]  All for what's coming in the next several years.
[13:46.000 --> 13:56.000]  People say, well, when is it coming? We're already in it, but we're going deeper down the pit.
[13:56.000 --> 14:06.000]  One of the IMF and World Bank documents that I wrote about in my book, 9-11, The Sentineterity, last chapter, that I've talked about over and over since we learned about them in early 2002,
[14:06.000 --> 14:12.000]  that I've been screaming bloody murder every week about, many, many weeks, every day.
[14:12.000 --> 14:19.000]  They state, the BBC were even reported on it, that they will bankrupt the nation,
[14:19.000 --> 14:31.000]  and then when the people riot from losing their homes and starving, they will turn the military and police loose on us and bring in open martial law.
[14:31.000 --> 14:35.000]  And let me tell you something, cops, when you don't have money to go to football games anymore,
[14:35.000 --> 14:40.000]  that's all a lot of Americans care about, or when you don't have money to go on that trip or money to have that bass boat,
[14:40.000 --> 14:44.000]  but at least you still got your uniform and can strut around and have folks bow down to you,
[14:44.000 --> 14:50.000]  just remember, your bosses are illegitimate and they destroyed this country, that there's no doubt the government's rogue and criminal,
[14:50.000 --> 14:56.000]  and I don't want to be your enemy.
[14:56.000 --> 15:03.000]  You know, the Dallas cops were friendly and waved at us and smiled at us, and they had a lieutenant out there,
[15:03.000 --> 15:08.000]  and I said, hey, you know, the fellow reserves private, he smiled at me, he goes, yeah, I know it's private, well, I know all about it.
[15:08.000 --> 15:14.000]  The cops were smiling at us, waving at us, all of them.
[15:14.000 --> 15:19.000]  They weren't being rude, weren't looking for trouble, weren't shoving people, weren't in our faces, you know why, because they know, they know.
[15:19.000 --> 15:23.000]  So that's good, that's what we want, we want to work with you.
[15:23.000 --> 15:29.000]  But you've got bad guys at the federal level through your local governments who are controlling your cities,
[15:29.000 --> 15:34.000]  who have taken the pension funds, the teacher funds, the police funds, the fire funds, all of it.
[15:34.000 --> 15:37.000]  On record, it's already out of the country, it's gone.
[15:37.000 --> 15:41.000]  And then they're going to need you to make sure we can't get our government back,
[15:41.000 --> 15:48.000]  because if we get the government back, then we can go and bring to justice the individuals that carried this out.
[15:48.000 --> 15:59.000]  And don't say you weren't warned, don't say you weren't told, don't say you weren't given a choice down the road.
[15:59.000 --> 16:01.000]  I mean, look at these headlines I've got.
[16:01.000 --> 16:05.000]  Military examines, role in domestic defense.
[16:05.000 --> 16:09.000]  Bush says more cash infusions may be needed to safeguard our financial system,
[16:09.000 --> 16:13.000]  while the financial system shuts off liquidity to Main Street in their own documents.
[16:13.000 --> 16:14.000]  They did it.
[16:14.000 --> 16:17.000]  They caused the problem and then grandstand is the solution.
[16:17.000 --> 16:20.000]  Small banks have set with city bailout.
[16:20.000 --> 16:22.000]  Now they don't get any money.
[16:22.000 --> 16:25.000]  Fed announces new U.S. mortgage support program.
[16:25.000 --> 16:28.000]  People are saying, oh, they're going to finally help us, folks.
[16:28.000 --> 16:32.000]  They state in the new plan Treasury put out yesterday with Bush in that press conference
[16:32.000 --> 16:36.000]  that you're not going to get one red cent of this money.
[16:36.000 --> 16:41.000]  This money is to buy up other banks and insurance companies and roads and infrastructure
[16:41.000 --> 16:45.000]  and to buy bad derivative securities.
[16:45.000 --> 16:48.000]  It has nothing to do with your mortgages.
[16:48.000 --> 16:50.000]  Here's the drudge report.
[16:50.000 --> 16:54.000]  Russian analysts, top Russian analysts predicts decline and break up of the U.S.
[16:54.000 --> 16:56.000]  Forget the Russian analyst.
[16:56.000 --> 16:58.000]  The Pentagon's predicting that.
[16:58.000 --> 17:00.000]  The British Ministry of Defense is predicting that.
[17:00.000 --> 17:02.000]  They're doing it by design.
[17:02.000 --> 17:05.000]  And this is going to be seen worldwide as the defeat of the American Empire,
[17:05.000 --> 17:11.000]  when really it's the U.S. imploding and being subdivided like China was 150 years ago
[17:11.000 --> 17:15.000]  to Europe and the United States and then breaking it up into sectors.
[17:15.000 --> 17:17.000]  This is the world government being born.
[17:17.000 --> 17:20.000]  All you guys have done horrible things in the name of the United States.
[17:20.000 --> 17:27.000]  You were working the entire time to actually destroy our name, bankrupt us and set us up.
[17:27.000 --> 17:29.000]  It's not too late to turn back.
[17:29.000 --> 17:31.000]  It's not too late to reprieve yourself.
[17:31.000 --> 17:34.000]  It's not too late to hit your knees and ask God for forgiveness
[17:34.000 --> 17:40.000]  and join humanity in the defense of liberty.
[17:40.000 --> 17:45.000]  Icelanders demand Prime Minister resigned during violent protest.
[17:45.000 --> 17:47.000]  Parliament besieged Iceland boiling.
[17:47.000 --> 17:52.000]  Mad at credit crunch.
[17:52.000 --> 17:55.000]  They're going to raise the income taxes in England to 61 percent.
[17:55.000 --> 17:57.000]  It's already 80 plus percent in France.
[17:57.000 --> 18:00.000]  London Telegraph took, quote, pay the bankers.
[18:00.000 --> 18:03.000]  You have to pay together this money, you understand?
[18:03.000 --> 18:07.000]  And it isn't going to be the rich. It's everybody.
[18:07.000 --> 18:09.000]  Cynthia McKinney prevented from leaving the United States.
[18:09.000 --> 18:11.000]  That's up on prisonplanet.com, all part of the new freedom.
[18:11.000 --> 18:13.000]  And then look at this headline.
[18:13.000 --> 18:16.000]  Social services set up CCTV cameras in couples' bedroom.
[18:16.000 --> 18:19.000]  I think you can't make this stuff up.
[18:19.000 --> 18:24.000]  What's next?
[18:24.000 --> 18:30.000]  Now, Iceland per capita is the second most wealthy country in the world.
[18:30.000 --> 18:32.000]  Number one is Switzerland.
[18:32.000 --> 18:36.000]  Okay.
[18:36.000 --> 18:41.000]  After that, what does it do by and then the United States?
[18:41.000 --> 18:43.000]  But these are very well ordered.
[18:43.000 --> 18:46.000]  They have one of the lowest crime rates in the world.
[18:46.000 --> 18:49.000]  One of the highest educational levels in the world.
[18:49.000 --> 18:51.000]  They have the strictest immigration rules there.
[18:51.000 --> 18:55.000]  I mean, it is a very nice place to live.
[18:55.000 --> 18:57.000]  Talk to folks that have visited there on vacation,
[18:57.000 --> 19:01.000]  people that have family there, and then work there on work visas.
[19:01.000 --> 19:04.000]  Overnight, there's no food on the shelves.
[19:04.000 --> 19:07.000]  Overnight, people can't get their money out of the bank.
[19:07.000 --> 19:10.000]  Overnight, they're going and taking people's homes,
[19:10.000 --> 19:12.000]  and the people are attacking the police stations.
[19:12.000 --> 19:14.000]  I mean, what do you think is going to happen
[19:14.000 --> 19:17.000]  when you don't give people any room to wiggle,
[19:17.000 --> 19:19.000]  when you corner us?
[19:19.000 --> 19:22.000]  You're going to drive guns and your sound cannons aren't going to help you.
[19:22.000 --> 19:26.000]  The police, by the way, were forced to basically back off in Iceland.
[19:26.000 --> 19:32.000]  Because, I mean, it's middle class, mainline people attacking the police stations on video.
[19:32.000 --> 19:34.000]  We're going to get into that later.
[19:34.000 --> 19:37.000]  This is going to happen here.
[19:37.000 --> 19:38.000]  Okay?
[19:38.000 --> 19:40.000]  And then the cops are going to gun a bunch of people down,
[19:40.000 --> 19:42.000]  and then the guns are going to come out,
[19:42.000 --> 19:46.000]  and then I really don't want to happen what's happening,
[19:46.000 --> 19:48.000]  because it's going to be bad.
[19:48.000 --> 19:50.000]  And believe me, let me just tell the police something.
[19:50.000 --> 20:19.000]  You're going to get your butt kicked.
[20:20.000 --> 20:46.000]  You're going to get your butt kicked.

[22:17.000 --> 22:23.000]  I believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[22:23.000 --> 22:27.000]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[22:27.000 --> 22:52.000]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[22:52.000 --> 22:58.000]  What will you do when the economy collapses, store shelves are empty, and your stored food is gone?

[23:52.000 --> 24:17.000]  In the Pentagon War Planning, the Rand Corporation War Planning, the British Ministry of Defense War Planning, they state they know the local police are meant to be smashed in the position they put the public.
[24:17.000 --> 24:25.000]  We're not an agrarian farming society where if the banks shut off the money, people can just live off their farms.
[24:25.000 --> 24:33.000]  We're in a technological society with two days of food on the store shelves.
[24:33.000 --> 24:48.000]  That's why they're moving MREs. I saw a report on this over the weekend. And weapons and things like that into key infrastructure positions like power plants.
[24:48.000 --> 24:57.000]  Now, I'm not saying that all of this has to unfold or happen. I'm telling you what the government's hearing up for and what they're saying on the open discussions of depression all over the news.
[24:57.000 --> 25:19.000]  Now, in Iceland, they have taken everything the people have. And in their capital city, the people are out demonstrating and going to the parliament and the police have been arresting people for no reason, basically.
[25:19.000 --> 25:28.000]  Which, I mean, it's destroying their country too. They have no future. But see, they've got to learn that peer pressure mode.
[25:28.000 --> 25:37.000]  And so the citizens then turned on the police station itself. And by the way, there are other reports in Iceland of this happening as well. It's happening in China.
[25:37.000 --> 25:53.000]  Humans are all the same. People are people. We want freedom. And the people understand they're educated in Iceland. They understand the banks imploded their credit by design, shut down the banks, and won't give them their money.
[25:53.000 --> 26:02.000]  And then the nation doesn't have credit. The companies in the nation don't have credit because it's been cut off to them to even ship food in.
[26:02.000 --> 26:14.000]  You understand? The IMF and World Bank documents state that they shut food and water off in essential services to cause rioting, which then makes the stock markets and property values and everything plunged to almost zero.
[26:14.000 --> 26:25.000]  Then they come in and buy it, then poses the saviors, and then turn the economy back on. Let's go ahead and play this clip.
[26:25.000 --> 26:32.000]  Hundreds gathered for peaceful protests in Iceland. Protests which ended with a police charge and pepper spray.
[26:32.000 --> 26:43.000]  Around 7,000 people gathered in downtown Rakjevic yesterday, a familiar scene since the country's recent banking crisis plunged the small nation into economic chaos.
[26:43.000 --> 26:52.000]  Several people gave heated speeches, their main demands that the government and chairman of the banks resign, and that elections be called as soon as possible.
[26:52.000 --> 27:02.000]  At the end of the meeting, the organizers reminded all present that one of their own had been arrested the previous day in what they claimed was unconstitutional police action.
[27:02.000 --> 27:14.000]  Several hundred protesters then made their way towards police headquarters where demonstrations continued and eventually escalated into a small riot where police refused to release the jailed protester.
[27:14.000 --> 27:25.000]  Rioters threw rocks and broke windows and used makeshift battering rams to break down the doors of the police headquarters with police barricaded inside still holding the arrested protester.
[27:25.000 --> 27:35.000]  The standoff ensued which only ended when an anonymous benefactor paid the protesters outstanding fine for disorderly conduct and emerged to a jubilant crowd.
[27:35.000 --> 27:40.000]  A police spokesman said several people were injured and taken to hospital.
[27:40.000 --> 27:47.000]  Now, there are other reports all over the western world of similar things happening.
[27:47.000 --> 27:56.000]  Now, the police could have rubber-bulleted, could have even shot with lead bullets the crowd, and then the crowd, the people would have burned down the city.
[27:56.000 --> 27:58.000]  See how that works?
[27:58.000 --> 28:07.000]  Nice-looking, middle-class people, the veneer of civilization is very, very thin and you steal their money.
[28:07.000 --> 28:15.000]  They don't have food, they're going to get angry and see this is just two weeks into Iceland collapsing.
[28:15.000 --> 28:19.000]  It's going to exponentially grow.
[28:19.000 --> 28:24.000]  And so, the people have been put in a position where they have to fight back.
[28:24.000 --> 28:36.000]  Now, what could happen is the government factions that support the public and are legitimate need to move for criminal investigations of the private banks.
[28:36.000 --> 28:39.000]  They need to go ahead and arrest before they can flee.
[28:39.000 --> 28:42.000]  The police need to join the people.
[28:42.000 --> 28:49.000]  They need to go arrest the head of their central bank and then they can fix their house very quickly or they can let the banks rape them.
[28:49.000 --> 28:51.000]  Would that be nice police to actually be with the people?
[28:51.000 --> 28:55.000]  Wouldn't it be nice to actually go after the real criminals?
[28:55.000 --> 28:57.000]  Same thing in Argentina.
[28:57.000 --> 28:59.000]  Same things being set up here.
[28:59.000 --> 29:00.000]  It's the same group.
[29:00.000 --> 29:01.000]  We have their documents.
[29:01.000 --> 29:04.000]  We've interviewed IMF and World Bank employees.
[29:04.000 --> 29:06.000]  It's been declassified.
[29:06.000 --> 29:09.000]  This is by design.
[29:09.000 --> 29:16.000]  They just cut the credit off to the country and said, you don't get your money out of the bank.
[29:16.000 --> 29:22.000]  Now, that's 7,000 plus protesting there.
[29:22.000 --> 29:30.000]  But if they would have attacked the couple hundred people that went to take over the police station, the whole 7,000 would have swarmed the police.
[29:30.000 --> 29:32.000]  You see?
[29:32.000 --> 29:35.000]  Now, we're peacefully demonstrating here in the United States.
[29:35.000 --> 29:38.000]  But how long will that hold?
[29:38.000 --> 29:43.000]  We'll ride back and play some of those clips from in the Fed here in the U.S.
[29:43.000 --> 29:47.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.

[33:21.000 --> 33:23.000]  All right.
[33:51.000 --> 33:58.000]  Today, talking about taking your pension fund to protect it.
[33:58.000 --> 34:15.000]  You see, the banks got the cities, counties, the different departments, the states, the fed, the different agencies to invest 60-plus percent of all the tax money of the last 50, almost 60 years, since 47, so more than 60, 61 years.
[34:15.000 --> 34:22.000]  And they use that, they fence that money into other institutions and buy real assets and infrastructure.
[34:22.000 --> 34:27.000]  Then when they're ready, they blow out the banks and brokerage firms and insurance companies.
[34:27.000 --> 34:30.000]  Enron was a dummy Ponzi scheme.
[34:30.000 --> 34:31.000]  It didn't fail.
[34:31.000 --> 34:34.000]  It was designed to implode.
[34:34.000 --> 34:37.000]  And hundreds of billions were stolen.
[34:37.000 --> 34:40.000]  Now tens of trillions are being stolen.
[34:40.000 --> 34:44.000]  7.4 trillion, according to Bloomberg, so far.
[34:44.000 --> 34:50.000]  That is, by the way, more than the entire GDP in 2007.
[34:50.000 --> 34:55.000]  We won't get GDP numbers until next year for 2008.
[34:55.000 --> 34:58.000]  Reports Bloomberg.
[34:58.000 --> 35:04.000]  So, 7.4 trillion.
[35:04.000 --> 35:10.000]  And none of it is going for what they claimed it was six weeks ago, back on October 3rd.
[35:10.000 --> 35:14.000]  None of it is going to the economy.
[35:14.000 --> 35:15.000]  And of course not.
[35:15.000 --> 35:17.000]  They don't want the economy jump-started.
[35:17.000 --> 35:19.000]  They don't want...
[35:19.000 --> 35:23.000]  Six weeks ago, when they got up on TV, the Treasury Secretary and the rest of them said,
[35:23.000 --> 35:24.000]  we're going to have a depression.
[35:24.000 --> 35:27.000]  If you don't do this, they destroyed confidence, folks.
[35:27.000 --> 35:29.000]  They precipitated it.
[35:29.000 --> 35:38.000]  Just at Bilderberg, two and a half years ago, they wanted to destroy confidence starting with the subprime mortgages so they can consolidate.
[35:38.000 --> 35:43.000]  And now in Iceland, the second-most wealthy nation in the world per capita.
[35:43.000 --> 35:51.000]  In two weeks' time, the majority of the banks will give their people none of their money.
[35:51.000 --> 35:53.000]  Most of the stores are completely bare.
[35:53.000 --> 35:58.000]  The people are there saying, fire the head of this private central bank.
[35:58.000 --> 36:00.000]  They engineered this.
[36:00.000 --> 36:02.000]  Mainstream news over there.
[36:02.000 --> 36:05.000]  The people understand.
[36:05.000 --> 36:11.000]  Tough times have a way of getting people focused to actually research and go, wow, these guys took over.
[36:11.000 --> 36:17.000]  And worldwide, folks are coming to infowars.com and prismplanet.com and infowars.net, and prismtimes.us,
[36:17.000 --> 36:21.000]  jonesreport.com, our sites, and finding out the truth, the documents, the videos.
[36:21.000 --> 36:29.000]  They're seeing us five, ten, plus years ago, predict and lay out what was happening.
[36:29.000 --> 36:31.000]  We weren't sure when the bankers were going to do it.
[36:31.000 --> 36:34.000]  We just knew in their own documents that they were planning to do it in the future
[36:34.000 --> 36:37.520]  and that they had it so leveraged in debt a decade ago they could have pulled the same thing.
[36:38.960 --> 36:45.040]  But then in 2002 we learned that they were planning it in 2008-2009. Then two and a half
[36:45.040 --> 36:50.240]  years ago with our moles inside Bilderberg we learned the specifics and laid out exactly what
[36:50.240 --> 36:57.200]  was happening. Last week I played those video clips from Canada that we shot with the sources
[36:57.200 --> 37:05.200]  saying exactly what happened precisely what would unfold. So if you're a new listener
[37:05.920 --> 37:15.360]  you better listen carefully because we know the patriot movement we read the documents about
[37:15.360 --> 37:20.320]  the new world order we found out about the plans who started the modern patriot movement
[37:20.320 --> 37:28.000]  in the last 20 years. They were all former military normally in intelligence officers
[37:29.040 --> 37:37.120]  they were police officers they were people in positions of power that found out about this
[37:37.120 --> 37:41.360]  and were told this was being set up who went public and said no to it.
[37:41.360 --> 37:50.800]  And now it's gone from being secret to being public just like we told you a year and a half
[37:50.800 --> 38:00.240]  before it was in the news that they'd hired 24,000 no 26,000 as of last year preachers
[38:03.280 --> 38:07.920]  to go tell their flocks martial law is good turning your guns in is good doing what the
[38:07.920 --> 38:14.000]  government says is good going to FEMA camps is good so of course we've been screaming bloody
[38:14.000 --> 38:18.480]  murder here on air of course we've been freaking out and warning you of course we've been upset
[38:19.120 --> 38:24.720]  of course we've been worried because we see the preparation we know it's being set up we know it's
[38:24.720 --> 38:34.880]  horrible and out of the crisis that is created by a financial collapse they then manage it
[38:34.880 --> 38:41.120]  and poses the savers and bring us into full tyranny let's play a mbc club out of chicago
[38:41.120 --> 38:47.440]  within the fed getting some coverage on the web at us home auction dot com the bidding resumes at
[38:47.440 --> 38:52.000]  9 30 tomorrow morning in rosemont that's a great for the people losing their homes of course in
[38:52.000 --> 38:56.480]  a related story major protests in cities across the nation today they rallied against the federal
[38:56.480 --> 39:07.440]  reserve here in chicago demonstrators are calling for a dismantling of the fed activists believe
[39:07.440 --> 39:12.000]  the federal reserve bank is responsible for the current financial crisis they claim government
[39:12.000 --> 39:16.960]  bailouts will further disrupt the economy and plunge the nation into a severe depression
[39:16.960 --> 39:21.840]  they support legislation introduced by representative ron paul to shut down the nearly
[39:21.840 --> 39:27.920]  century old federal reserve bank other news now all right i have probably just looking around this
[39:27.920 --> 39:32.320]  weekend at the hotel computers i didn't spend much time and then looking some last night
[39:32.320 --> 39:37.840]  this morning when i got back to austin i don't know probably seven eight news reports and and
[39:37.840 --> 39:44.800]  they're all local in texas and in illinois and few places like that so we got some coverage there
[39:44.800 --> 39:48.800]  doesn't matter the the alternative media is carrying the ball and getting the word out
[39:48.800 --> 39:56.480]  so they're not stopping us there here is a compilation put out by a video crew that was out there
[39:58.480 --> 40:02.240]  of some of my speeches and some of the things i had to say
[40:02.240 --> 40:06.800]  out there a short compilation and then we'll continue breaking down what's happening but
[40:06.800 --> 40:10.800]  the bottom line here is here are the american people doing just exactly what people are doing
[40:10.800 --> 40:15.680]  in argentina what they're doing in iceland what they're doing all over the world pointing out
[40:15.680 --> 40:19.680]  who the real enemy is pointing out of the real culprits are here it is
[40:36.400 --> 40:39.680]  hey i want to talk to the workers up there on the parapet
[40:39.680 --> 40:45.680]  i want smoking cigarettes and just jump back you're with the american people we know that but
[40:45.680 --> 40:52.160]  understand as the workers inside you're not in a federal government building you're in a private
[40:52.160 --> 40:57.760]  federal reserve that uses that name as a fraud i'm not a federal government i'm not a federal
[40:57.760 --> 41:04.160]  agency but if i said my name was federal reserve i could go out and pay off politicians and get them
[41:04.160 --> 41:09.200]  to allow me to get into power so i could issue the currency and quit it and then i could buy
[41:09.200 --> 41:15.120]  up the world that's what these criminals have done the federal reserve is totally private
[41:15.120 --> 41:21.920]  and ellen greenspan two weeks ago on pbs on lair news hour said ellen greenspan two weeks ago
[41:21.920 --> 41:29.200]  on lair news hour said on record that they are above the law the congress the president everyone
[41:30.320 --> 41:37.120]  the former federal reserve chairman on the lair news hour a few weeks ago came out and said
[41:37.120 --> 41:44.320]  we are above the law congress the president no court can do anything we want america think of
[41:44.320 --> 41:51.360]  the arrogance of private group of banks that have bankrupted the nation by design so they can repo the
[41:51.360 --> 41:57.840]  country a private group of banks that loaned us our own money back are telling us they're above the
[41:57.840 --> 42:03.440]  law you are not above the law criminal appreciate you guys too and this is gonna hurt all your
[42:03.440 --> 42:08.720]  families all the police officers here the camera people here everybody's who's here to cover this
[42:08.720 --> 42:12.400]  needs to know that that's why we're here so we're going to go ahead and let them know that we're
[42:12.400 --> 42:22.240]  not their slaves the federal reserve is a run-for-profit private organization this is everything
[42:22.240 --> 42:27.520]  instead of our economy being about goods and services and real products and manufacturing
[42:27.520 --> 42:31.920]  it's all about these guys the private federal reserve that masquerades as a government entity
[42:31.920 --> 42:36.800]  who controls the issuance of currency and credit they're the ones that have cut off
[42:37.520 --> 42:41.440]  the liquidity in the market they told us have a debt-based economy then they cut it off once
[42:41.440 --> 42:46.400]  they get us under their thumb and implode the economy so they can consolidate it that's what
[42:46.400 --> 42:49.200]  they're doing right now i mean it's it's in their own documents it's in their own statements
[42:50.160 --> 42:54.000]  they claim give us unlimited power give us trillions of dollars with a baker bailout bill
[42:54.000 --> 42:58.880]  that's already five trillion dollars not eight hundred fifty billion as they say and we'll get
[42:58.880 --> 43:02.560]  the economy going but they're hoarding the money and buying up other banks and our part of the
[43:02.560 --> 43:07.360]  federal reserve buying up insurance companies buying up roads infrastructures media empires
[43:07.360 --> 43:13.280]  defense contractors what the banks do is they implode an economy by cutting off uh credit and
[43:13.280 --> 43:18.240]  then once things really fall to a low and they know the low because then they buy everything up
[43:18.240 --> 43:22.480]  and start then putting more money back into the economy and then they build it back up so they
[43:22.480 --> 43:27.440]  build us up and then share us build us up and share us and they're getting ready all over the world
[43:27.440 --> 43:31.600]  they're always shearing some country imploding it comes out in their own IMF world bank documents
[43:31.600 --> 43:35.920]  that's just the foreign arm of the same cartel yeah what they do is that they make you think
[43:35.920 --> 43:41.440]  clinton's evil and running things then oh bush will save us and then oh bush was evil now we'll
[43:41.440 --> 43:47.280]  be saved by rock obama but he's just a puppet but as we get deeper into this phase uh when they
[43:47.280 --> 43:51.520]  implode the economy they have all the money and all the control and then but they also like to
[43:51.520 --> 43:57.520]  pose as the savior so obama is meant to be the savior during the depression and he'll save us
[43:57.520 --> 44:02.720]  with a million person he said is bigger bigger than our military domestic spy force a three
[44:02.720 --> 44:08.560]  million person environmental spy force so giving people these jobs to be government bureaucrats
[44:08.560 --> 44:13.360]  and spies to go out and manage the other uh you know two hundred and ninety something million
[44:13.360 --> 44:19.920]  americans and so this is classical fascism the communists also do it any vertically integrated
[44:19.920 --> 44:25.920]  command and control authoritarian system does this so they're openly following what the same group
[44:25.920 --> 44:31.200]  of banks did in germany russia you know it's in the communist manifesto to have a private central
[44:31.200 --> 44:35.760]  bank because the private central bankers actually wrote the ideas that they had marx and engels put
[44:35.760 --> 44:40.320]  out people go well why would the banks want communism it doesn't exist they rape us they
[44:40.320 --> 44:45.840]  consolidate us they put us into work brigades they make us slaves and they say it's a people's paradise
[44:45.840 --> 44:51.280]  look at it boy you're really doing good and then they transfer all the wealth of the nation offshore
[44:51.280 --> 44:55.120]  the globalists are outside all the nations that gives them safety and they play countries off
[44:55.120 --> 44:59.360]  against each other and so that's what we're facing and dealing with and so they're bringing in classical
[44:59.360 --> 45:04.880]  hardcore tyranny in the us but we have the internet we've grown our numbers the alternative media is
[45:04.880 --> 45:08.960]  exploded that's what they're trying to move in to shut down and regulate and tax the web but it's
[45:08.960 --> 45:14.800]  too late for them uh they're they're playing in the 19th century 20th century rules it's 21st
[45:14.800 --> 45:20.640]  century the century of resistance to tyranny and so it's going to be one hell of a fight everything
[45:20.640 --> 45:26.000]  depends on exposing these people everything depends on showing the people that this is the new old
[45:26.000 --> 45:30.800]  order this is the criminals we're dealing with the king rats here the people that are carrying out
[45:30.800 --> 45:36.880]  tyranny worldwide and either they fall or we fall either worldwide darkness and a new age of tyranny
[45:36.880 --> 45:42.400]  and oppression and with a scientific overlay or a new age of liberty and freedom and a new
[45:42.400 --> 45:47.280]  renaissance the choice the choice is the people's out there okay we can tell you what's going on
[45:47.280 --> 45:51.600]  you can check it out for yourself and find out it's true but don't wait investigate now get involved
[45:51.600 --> 45:56.160]  now go out there and reach out now we don't have time if you're looking for the solution
[45:56.800 --> 46:01.920]  look in the mirror look right into the mirror because you out there men women old young black
[46:01.920 --> 46:08.080]  white doesn't matter it's going to be up to you if they win or if liberty succeeds and the people
[46:08.080 --> 46:12.640]  have a chance of having any future these are cold-blooded eugenicists these are cold-blooded
[46:12.640 --> 46:16.480]  people who think they're god think that there are masters and think that we're animals these are
[46:16.480 --> 46:21.440]  the guys that funded linen and stalling and hitler and mal these are the guys it's all on record
[46:21.440 --> 46:28.160]  that bankroll this stuff they are hardcore vicious and they must be resistant all right i've got
[46:28.160 --> 46:33.840]  several other clips uh let's play the one that starts at 350 uh john i want to play the clip
[46:33.840 --> 46:42.080]  that's got just a little comment uh from ron paul's brother wane paul we've got a longer interview
[46:42.080 --> 46:44.960]  i'm just playing a youtube clip somebody else posted because we haven't had time to get ours
[46:44.960 --> 46:52.480]  up yet we appreciate folks um this is a uh short clip of him saying the answer in 1984 1776
[46:52.480 --> 46:56.160]  i'm gonna play a clip where i'm thanking the police at the end of the demonstration for
[46:56.720 --> 47:01.600]  you know not acting like they hate free speech and hate america why we appreciate that uh so
[47:01.600 --> 47:06.400]  uh when they act normal and act like they're with us and you know with the american people and
[47:07.040 --> 47:09.840]  um peace officers we're all for them let's go ahead and play that next clip
[47:19.200 --> 47:26.880]  my name is wane paul and the answer to 1984 is 1776
[47:26.880 --> 47:28.880]  yeah
[47:35.440 --> 47:43.200]  that's what we want back today we want the ability to use our brain and use the fruits of our labor
[47:44.160 --> 47:49.040]  to help mankind and we we're having an extractive from us on a daily basis
[47:50.240 --> 47:55.760]  so we got to pass that bill to abolish it got to do it you speak directly to abolishing that
[47:55.760 --> 48:03.840]  that the effect i i i think if if there's any one bill that you could tell every congressman in
[48:03.840 --> 48:11.840]  this country to do is to vote for that bill absolutely the most vital vote you could anybody
[48:11.840 --> 48:17.120]  up there to do it right far as the sponsorship up to now it's about 60 in it that's what i heard
[48:17.120 --> 48:29.200]  okay let's go on to the next clip now here we go by the next one of the next uh in the fed clip
[48:36.400 --> 48:42.000]  i'm gonna jump up here real fast real quick i just wanna say i'm out of june and we're sick of it
[48:42.000 --> 48:50.880]  you do it all right i'm not really mad right now i don't really you're gonna say i'm out of june
[48:50.880 --> 49:02.880]  and we're sick of it i'm out of june and we are sick of it we're sick of it sick of it speaking of that
[49:02.880 --> 49:09.840]  again this has been absolutely amazing absolutely amazing i want to say something else
[49:09.840 --> 49:15.840]  that's important about the first amendment after the government stays in 9-11 attacks
[49:17.040 --> 49:21.680]  they tried to claim that people couldn't protest and demonstrate without permits
[49:21.680 --> 49:25.760]  and then they would refuse the issue of the permits or they put people in three-speed zones
[49:25.760 --> 49:32.320]  and then arrest them but thousands of lawsuits later all over the country the first amendment
[49:32.320 --> 49:40.800]  is now being recognized and not trampled again and i want to say the Dallas police have not
[49:40.800 --> 49:45.440]  just done their job to protect the first amendment they've been pretty cheerful and friendly and
[49:49.200 --> 49:54.480]  yeah they've been pretty nice and they have actually acted friendly towards us and that's
[49:54.480 --> 50:02.800]  what we want because they're american people too and the Federal Reserve is going to destroy their future
[50:02.800 --> 50:09.520]  as well so we're all together whether we know it or not whether we consciously admit it we are all
[50:09.520 --> 50:18.400]  together free humanity against the new world order you know the Federal Reserve
[50:18.400 --> 50:25.520]  for 90 years has brainwashed public school children that they are a government bank
[50:27.360 --> 50:34.000]  and now they're intensifying their propaganda bringing in school teachers and college professors
[50:34.000 --> 50:39.760]  and administrators and they've got hundreds of them in there right now brainwashing them about
[50:39.760 --> 50:45.440]  how the Federal Reserve is government and how the Federal Reserve wants to fix the economy
[50:45.440 --> 50:50.800]  when the Federal Reserve is the enemy and we're here to tell them we're not going to stand by

[55:11.360 --> 55:17.680]  defense troops on the streets of america with the police cbs news been telling you that for 13 years
[55:19.520 --> 55:23.360]  when i witnessed marines training to confiscate our guns and admitting it was for america
[55:23.360 --> 55:28.160]  and i said man i'm against that and they said what you don't like our military there's some kind
[55:28.160 --> 55:34.160]  of call me uh if it's really our military they're not training to take our guns if it's our military
[55:34.160 --> 55:39.200]  they're not training to attack the american people and you know what it's not our military
[55:40.000 --> 55:45.600]  those individual men and women are good folks that's why the majority of them get campaign
[55:45.600 --> 55:50.960]  contributions are on paul more than any other candidate but the people directing them are pure
[55:50.960 --> 55:58.160]  evil so you got a decision to make a lot of you out there in government who do you stand with
[55:59.040 --> 56:04.160]  how far will you go how many criminal orders will you follow that's all coming up but again
[56:04.160 --> 56:08.640]  they're rioting in iceland because the police are falsely arresting people breaking down the doors
[56:08.640 --> 56:16.000]  of police stations it's it's it's all coming to a head i want to bring ted up for this segment
[56:16.000 --> 56:20.000]  the next and i'm gonna get into all the news and take your phone calls a lot of other audio clips
[56:20.000 --> 56:25.120]  from around the country in the world a bunch of other important news um and again the ron paul
[56:25.120 --> 56:31.600]  speech but um ted so much is happening i mean on a daily basis now they're going to quote bail out
[56:31.600 --> 56:39.360]  that means capitalize and fund city bank with hundreds of billions of dollars and they're using
[56:39.360 --> 56:43.920]  the the car bailout as a diversion whether you're forward or against it 25 billion is nothing compared
[56:43.920 --> 56:48.880]  to 7.4 trillion you heard me in the clip from saturday saying five plus trillion and then
[56:48.880 --> 56:52.720]  bloomberg came out the government admitted on sunday you know it already been two trillion more
[56:52.720 --> 56:59.600]  in a week do you have any idea what this means and interest on it ted i mean i know i'm ranting
[56:59.600 --> 57:04.800]  here i wanted to get you up it's just getting incredible ted it is who incredible is is a
[57:04.800 --> 57:10.400]  good word for it i mean it's it's uh it's amazing and now they're talking about coming in and just
[57:10.400 --> 57:15.520]  paying off credit cards and student loans and all these you know the printing press is not the
[57:15.520 --> 57:22.560]  solution here and this uh last protest we had over the fed that's the solution we need to get rid
[57:22.560 --> 57:28.320]  of that printing press stop the printing press the uh the uh economic power of the people will
[57:28.320 --> 57:33.040]  tend to be clear though with the home with that with these student loans with the credit cards
[57:33.040 --> 57:36.880]  the people aren't going to get them paid off the banks will still get to collect and get money
[57:37.440 --> 57:40.960]  that's exactly what where do you think the money is going to go off you pay off the credit card
[57:40.960 --> 57:44.560]  it goes right into the banking this is just a new bait and switch like they said oh we're going to
[57:44.560 --> 57:50.000]  get this money this uh 850 billion to help you with your mortgages and the next day they said
[57:50.000 --> 57:56.640]  you get none of it the thing about it is alex if you if you try to solve a problem i don't care
[57:56.640 --> 58:00.640]  if they're giving it to the two-year-olds out there with a printing press when you're putting
[58:00.640 --> 58:05.200]  money out in the system you're not creating value all you're doing is creating more currency
[58:05.200 --> 58:09.440]  yeah people understand this let me explain it let's say you collect dallas cowboy memorabilia
[58:09.440 --> 58:17.280]  now if there's one roger stallback nfl helmet uh superbowl helmet he won the thing's probably
[58:17.280 --> 58:24.720]  worth $50,000 but what if he took on and off 15 different helmets in that game you know the helmet
[58:24.720 --> 58:30.640]  would be worth a couple grand instead of $50,000 you got it it's devaluing gotta use sports analogies

[1:00:44.720 --> 1:00:49.840]  an example i'm just one person in this fight and i can go to england i can go to canada i can go
[1:00:49.840 --> 1:00:53.920]  california people in little towns all walking a little store and then people are hey we listen
[1:00:53.920 --> 1:00:58.640]  to your show it is growing exponentially and that means we've got a fighting chance now ted
[1:00:58.640 --> 1:01:05.600]  anderson i've got you up and we're here talking about 7.4 trillion so far given to the private
[1:01:05.600 --> 1:01:11.360]  banks of our tax money so that they cannot loan to people and hold it to buy up the currency and
[1:01:11.360 --> 1:01:16.720]  and and and and buy up the markets let me get more into that after you leave us but um you did a
[1:01:16.720 --> 1:01:22.000]  pitch here friday when we had john jones economic news you also told folks that you had bought in
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:28.960]  between a 701 and 710 because he did some different buys um you know when gold was at that level
[1:01:28.960 --> 1:01:34.560]  he bought gold coins and he's most people are sold out or can't even get them uh and uh ted was able
[1:01:34.560 --> 1:01:39.360]  because he's been in business 30 years to get really good buys out of europe in the us on maple
[1:01:39.360 --> 1:01:44.720]  leaves uh american eagles things nobody has very few people have their huge 30 40 premiums on
[1:01:44.720 --> 1:01:52.240]  he was able to offer those at below spot this was below spot because gold went up to you know 800
[1:01:52.240 --> 1:01:59.680]  bucks it's gone up another 12 bucks or so today it's 815 last time i checked the point is he bought
[1:01:59.680 --> 1:02:08.400]  gold at a little over 700 in that range because there was different buys summit 701 summit 706
[1:02:08.400 --> 1:02:14.320]  summit 7010 and so even with his tiny six percent markup in there to be able to you know get the
[1:02:14.320 --> 1:02:18.960]  gold in to pay his staff stuff like that and he's the reason the show is possible to his network
[1:02:21.280 --> 1:02:27.440]  he is able to then pass those savings on now he's sold out of the maple leaves he's almost sold out
[1:02:27.440 --> 1:02:34.000]  of the uh you are sold out of the american eagles uh he's got indians he's got francs and he's got
[1:02:35.840 --> 1:02:43.840]  sovereigns at that deal of 700 of of of last monday when he bought those
[1:02:45.200 --> 1:02:49.760]  and he held the deal through yesterday through the weekend this is probably the last time
[1:02:50.560 --> 1:02:54.640]  but he's guaranteeing even if he sells out of what he's got he will take the hit
[1:02:54.640 --> 1:02:58.160]  and and and bring it in and still you know at that level this is guaranteed
[1:02:58.160 --> 1:03:02.800]  to get this deal ted again as you said friday this is the best deal you've ever offered
[1:03:02.800 --> 1:03:06.560]  topping the one you did three months ago yeah and it got better because gold's up
[1:03:06.560 --> 1:03:12.000]  well it was up at 830 today last time i looked it was it was at 818 so what when we're talking
[1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:19.520]  about it on friday gold was at 799 same price on the british sovereign they're 228 the frank
[1:03:19.520 --> 1:03:26.800]  at 187 alex before i put out the memo i walked in the studio mona my buyer she comes in she says
[1:03:26.800 --> 1:03:31.680]  are you crazy we have to pay a lot more than that for these coins right now and i said yep i'm
[1:03:31.680 --> 1:03:36.560]  going to run them and uh that's because we picked up this bit of supply there's not much left
[1:03:36.560 --> 1:03:41.600]  but i'm going to hold it i'll hold it throughout the rest of today if you want to buy gold right
[1:03:41.600 --> 1:03:46.960]  now buy the francs or buy the sovereign or pick up the 10 you need the 10 liberty because you're
[1:03:46.960 --> 1:03:50.960]  going to be getting it for a lot less than what i have to go out in the marketplace and get it for
[1:03:50.960 --> 1:03:55.440]  as a matter of fact dealers are paying for more paying more for them now than i'm even just selling
[1:03:55.440 --> 1:04:00.640]  them to you so you can't be you're not just getting the fact that ted's a huge wholesaler so you're
[1:04:00.640 --> 1:04:06.400]  getting his discount he's giving you the deal he got last monday at seven hundred dollars and you
[1:04:06.400 --> 1:04:12.000]  know 701 706 710 the different buys he did now now how many eagles do you have left you said you're
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:16.480]  low on the no the eagles are gone i i can't offer another eagle it's going to take too long to get
[1:04:16.480 --> 1:04:19.840]  them to the people what's the $10 piece you were talking about the $10 piece that i'm talking about
[1:04:19.840 --> 1:04:25.280]  is a $10 liberty from back at the turn of the century or the $10 liberty and then you have the
[1:04:25.280 --> 1:04:33.040]  francs and you have the sovereigns 800 686 2237 ladies and gentlemen there's a good chance they're
[1:04:33.040 --> 1:04:36.080]  going to seize the money in the bank there's a good chance we are going to have a full board
[1:04:36.080 --> 1:04:41.680]  depression move now into gold and silver come back to tell them about the silver on the other side

[1:08:40.160 --> 1:08:46.720]  ted anderson i want to get some of your views on what's happening right now these new developments
[1:08:46.720 --> 1:08:53.280]  separately from pitching gold at people but i will tell listeners this that when ted takes a huge
[1:08:53.280 --> 1:08:58.880]  risk when gold that he predicted had bottomed at seven hundred dollars an ounce and he bought a ton
[1:08:58.880 --> 1:09:06.160]  of it um he is now passing it all on to you any other broker in the world would simply you know
[1:09:06.160 --> 1:09:10.880]  sell gold for whatever the price is today and they're adding huge premiums again google gold
[1:09:10.880 --> 1:09:17.360]  selling for premiums central banks can't keep up gold sold out hundreds of mainstream news articles
[1:09:17.360 --> 1:09:23.920]  most places are sold out go to their sites go to their look look at the prices you will find uh this
[1:09:23.920 --> 1:09:29.760]  is below spot ladies and gentlemen and this is in a a bull market in precious metals ted is doing
[1:09:29.760 --> 1:09:35.360]  this because he wants to pass it on to the listeners because he's a great guy he's a free market guy
[1:09:35.360 --> 1:09:39.680]  and he loves to smash all his competition i'll just be honest with you and uh you should take
[1:09:39.680 --> 1:09:45.360]  advantage of this he made such a big buy and he told me this morning 90 percent of it's out the door
[1:09:45.360 --> 1:09:51.040]  last monday that this is it this is the tail end of this deal who knows if it'll come back
[1:09:51.040 --> 1:09:55.680]  you know buy in the next even year or two to ever have a deal like this again this dwarfs the deal
[1:09:55.680 --> 1:10:00.560]  he offered three months ago when he did something similar uh so again ted explain to people the
[1:10:00.560 --> 1:10:05.360]  mathematics we're talking about here well i mean take the british sovereign for instance that 228
[1:10:05.360 --> 1:10:10.080]  multiply that by four i mean you're just sitting right in that right in that range if there's no
[1:10:10.080 --> 1:10:14.720]  way you're not going to be able to get it i you can call every single dealer across the united
[1:10:14.720 --> 1:10:21.280]  states you are not going to buy a british sovereign for 228 anywhere not here not in britain not in
[1:10:21.280 --> 1:10:26.960]  though europe not in south africa anywhere i have them i have them for the least the lowest price
[1:10:26.960 --> 1:10:32.720]  and i also have the frank's right now 187 fifth of an ounce of gold obviously you want small gold
[1:10:32.720 --> 1:10:39.120]  pieces again nowhere i mean i mona came in alex and she says look at these are you know it's
[1:10:39.120 --> 1:10:44.800]  over 200 bucks a piece and you're selling them for 187 i said i don't care we picked up the
[1:10:44.800 --> 1:10:48.560]  position it was actually i put up the numbers it was close to three million dollars worth of this
[1:10:48.560 --> 1:10:54.000]  stuff and uh and i and i and i gotta tell you it makes me happy makes me happy that i'm putting
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:58.960]  gold into people's hands i mean you don't know how much of a treat it is for me to go down to the
[1:10:58.960 --> 1:11:04.080]  federal reserve bank and have a whole crowd of people yelling and the fat and the people driving
[1:11:04.080 --> 1:11:09.920]  by and you know though though though just the the pleasure of of being able to see it happen in front
[1:11:09.920 --> 1:11:16.880]  of my very eyes and fighting this fight to try to get people convinced that this institution is
[1:11:18.160 --> 1:11:23.200]  no good for the united states no good for the people and and you know to have it to the point
[1:11:23.200 --> 1:11:29.840]  where you know these clips that you're playing i mean you don't know how how much satisfaction
[1:11:29.840 --> 1:11:35.120]  that that just brings me to see that at all these years we've been here telling them the feds the
[1:11:35.120 --> 1:11:39.760]  enemy back when nobody who ron paul was you know you were promoting him and and and airing his little
[1:11:39.760 --> 1:11:44.320]  five minute radio show once a week here on the network and you know when you were there bank
[1:11:44.320 --> 1:11:48.880]  rolling the network all those years they lost money uh you know having to mortgage your house
[1:11:48.880 --> 1:11:54.960]  five years ago uh so the network wouldn't go under everything you did and now we're here the future
[1:11:54.960 --> 1:11:59.440]  is here we were right about everything people are exponentially tuning in and waking up and getting
[1:11:59.440 --> 1:12:04.880]  involved and getting protected uh ten from what i hear the the the best deal is the franks or the
[1:12:04.880 --> 1:12:09.680]  sovereigns uh they're both a fabulous deal alex because the market's gone up more than a hundred
[1:12:09.680 --> 1:12:15.120]  bucks since i've since i put this deal together for people the market took care of it i still get
[1:12:15.120 --> 1:12:20.320]  my little margin in there and what if you know if we if we uh if we have to go back and buy a few
[1:12:20.320 --> 1:12:25.200]  at the very end big deal so i get some gold and the people's hand to get a good price uh the
[1:12:25.200 --> 1:12:29.440]  sovereigns are a great buy the franks are a good buy that's good because they're small pieces of gold
[1:12:29.440 --> 1:12:34.080]  explain how this is working ten twenty thirty forty usually it's about a thirty percent premium
[1:12:34.080 --> 1:12:40.160]  just to even get gold for wholesalers wholesalers are paying ten twenty thirty percent over what's
[1:12:40.160 --> 1:12:45.840]  supposed spot is because we're in a manipulated market if you're lucky enough to find a us eagle
[1:12:45.840 --> 1:12:50.720]  right now you're paying over nine hundred dollars an ounce for the silly thing i mean it's crazy what
[1:12:50.720 --> 1:12:55.920]  the market is done and they're just the physical supply is so tight right now because everybody
[1:12:55.920 --> 1:13:01.600]  wants to put it away and the when you see the spot price fluctuating that's the futures market
[1:13:01.600 --> 1:13:06.240]  okay ted i want to be careful about this though do you want to say this is going to midnight or
[1:13:06.240 --> 1:13:10.400]  do you want to say it'll go until people stop answering the phones tonight because i don't
[1:13:10.400 --> 1:13:14.720]  want you to get you know upside down in this of the phones you know blow off the wall no i i can
[1:13:14.720 --> 1:13:19.280]  tell you i'll take it and i and i'll stay committed to this till midnight but i would suggest if you
[1:13:19.280 --> 1:13:25.600]  want to get into something that is so close to mel i mean that is quite literally the deal i don't
[1:13:25.600 --> 1:13:29.840]  know once before there was a check in the real market it's below mel i mean they've got that
[1:13:29.840 --> 1:13:36.320]  that that fictional of uh... you know comics but i mean in reality nobody i mean everybody's
[1:13:36.320 --> 1:13:41.040]  the brokers are paying premiums to even get it right yeah well there's there's not a dealer
[1:13:41.040 --> 1:13:46.480]  in the world right now that's offering frank's even at the wholesale level to sell at these prices
[1:13:46.480 --> 1:13:51.200]  so that's that's it and the and the uh... and the british sovereigns the ten dollar liberties
[1:13:51.200 --> 1:13:56.400]  on the ten dollar real market this is way below what real spot is yep yep that's right and you
[1:13:56.400 --> 1:13:59.840]  know there's a lot of people that are concerned about the stuff because it's so close to melt
[1:13:59.840 --> 1:14:03.920]  and confiscation but if you're concerned about that go to the ten union of the ten liberty
[1:14:03.920 --> 1:14:09.840]  that stuff is so close to mel right now too i mean everything is so tight in supply uh... the you
[1:14:09.840 --> 1:14:16.000]  know the the walking liberty half silver coins i i can't say it enough i mean here we have christmas
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:20.960]  coming up and people are gonna be buying people you know you know
[1:14:20.960 --> 1:14:26.800]  you know radios and all this stuff from these these electronics gizmos and and whatever this
[1:14:26.800 --> 1:14:31.360]  is something you can actually give to somebody and you know darn well that we've got a train wreck
[1:14:31.360 --> 1:14:35.920]  of an economy right now how about giving them something that they can actually use this will
[1:14:35.920 --> 1:14:42.080]  be something that'll support and and take care of their children they'll take care of their grandchildren
[1:14:42.080 --> 1:14:46.000]  people need to get gold and silver in their hands and once they start getting gold and silver in their
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:51.520]  hands they start to realize how messed up the federal reserve system is and and and what this
[1:14:51.520 --> 1:14:57.520]  real monetary system is about it only takes a little bit of it takes a seed to grow a plant
[1:14:57.520 --> 1:15:02.080]  and that's the idea that needs to be placed in the minds of the people that don't understand
[1:15:02.800 --> 1:15:07.920]  how money comes into existence and why it's losing purchasing power and why we got
[1:15:07.920 --> 1:15:13.600]  Paulson and Bernanke doing what they're doing and they're just trying to they're trying to protect
[1:15:13.600 --> 1:15:19.040]  the system to get it if it totally falls apart and blows up then we're gonna win and they don't
[1:15:19.040 --> 1:15:24.800]  want us to win and we're gonna fight hard to win because you know what it's about liberty it's about
[1:15:24.800 --> 1:15:30.880]  freedom it's about the constitution of the united states it's about we the people we're the ones
[1:15:30.880 --> 1:15:36.400]  who go out and labor for this wealth that we create we should be able to keep it and they
[1:15:36.400 --> 1:15:43.120]  shouldn't be able to destroy it by by printing more money absolutely and and and Ted take
[1:15:43.840 --> 1:15:48.400]  Iceland the second most wealthy nation per capita for someone with the lowest crime rates in the
[1:15:48.400 --> 1:15:52.960]  world they are attacking and breaking down the doors of police stations and government facilities
[1:15:52.960 --> 1:15:58.560]  right now because there's literally no food almost the store shelves the banks aren't giving them
[1:15:58.560 --> 1:16:05.120]  their own money i mean you know that's the point this is engineered it's it's it's it's fractional
[1:16:05.120 --> 1:16:10.560]  reserve banking at its at its highest most ultimate point it is the worst thing that could have ever
[1:16:10.560 --> 1:16:16.400]  happened to a society and our forefathers knew this Alex look how they terrorize this into going

[1:16:52.560 --> 1:16:58.880]  insurrection and rebellion and rioting why because they're gonna eat our lunch they do it by design

[1:17:45.600 --> 1:17:50.240]  trillion i'm gonna cover that when i come back uh and then the local banks small town banks you know
[1:17:50.240 --> 1:17:55.760]  that really are a part of the economy and in many cases actually helping uh the the local economies
[1:17:55.760 --> 1:17:59.760]  they're freaking out because they're actually solvent many of them and then they're getting
[1:17:59.760 --> 1:18:05.360]  bought out government regulators are coming in and forcing them to sell out uh to the big banks
[1:18:05.360 --> 1:18:10.240]  and they know it's a fraud i talked to a bank president who came to the end the fed protest
[1:18:10.240 --> 1:18:16.160]  with his son uh of a small uh a bank there in in northeast texas and you know he was saying they
[1:18:16.160 --> 1:18:20.800]  all know exactly what's going on well that's it they're they're lacing the pockets of these big
[1:18:20.800 --> 1:18:25.920]  wall street banks and they're taking that money and they're buying up these smaller banks and
[1:18:25.920 --> 1:18:30.400]  creating monopolies that are bigger than what they were then we have even a bigger problem guess
[1:18:30.400 --> 1:18:36.240]  what they're too big to fail they've just become bigger you know is that good obviously that's not
[1:18:36.240 --> 1:18:41.840]  good these community banks are the ones that are actually creating wealth and helping something along
[1:18:41.840 --> 1:18:47.680]  this this whole derivative thing that's coming out of out of wall street you know it it it just
[1:18:47.680 --> 1:18:54.400]  boggles my mind they took the majority of the pension funds of the investments of the stock market
[1:18:54.400 --> 1:19:00.640]  uh you know investments made by governments county state local federal the agencies there's tens of
[1:19:00.640 --> 1:19:04.640]  thousands of these different groups and invested and they invested in derivatives and they're now
[1:19:04.640 --> 1:19:09.840]  telling them it's all gone well the folks there they've already destroyed your pension funds
[1:19:09.840 --> 1:19:14.480]  and what's left of it mainstream news they're getting ready to take it the federal reserve
[1:19:14.480 --> 1:19:19.680]  system was put together alex for this reason they didn't want the smaller banks taking control
[1:19:19.680 --> 1:19:25.120]  they wanted to have this unified central thing that would that would allow them to collect
[1:19:25.120 --> 1:19:29.760]  the taxes and the and the debts from the entire world yeah they set up the income tax the same

[1:24:29.120 --> 1:24:37.120]  creating they plan to manage and manage the people into the world government you know i read a uh
[1:24:37.120 --> 1:24:42.160]  new york times article last week on air and showed you a shot of it on prison planet dot tv
[1:24:42.160 --> 1:24:49.200]  we were doing the live feed and it was where parents are putting surveillance cameras with live
[1:24:49.200 --> 1:24:55.600]  internet feeds off a wireless card in the cars to watch and track their children see how that's
[1:24:55.600 --> 1:25:00.560]  the big brother society and how the police in the new york state and connecticut state and
[1:25:00.560 --> 1:25:08.400]  others are paying for studies to make everybody have these cameras in their cars and then out of
[1:25:08.400 --> 1:25:12.480]  england and similar things are being proposed here the huge and police chief number two years
[1:25:12.480 --> 1:25:16.800]  ago proposed making people have cameras in their homes don't believe me google that term will come
[1:25:16.800 --> 1:25:23.920]  up social services set up cctv camera and couples bedroom and it said because they had the school
[1:25:23.920 --> 1:25:32.320]  records on them that the mother and father were educationally disadvantaged and so because they
[1:25:32.320 --> 1:25:36.880]  didn't have good test scores then when they had their baby it says they make the parents they just
[1:25:36.880 --> 1:25:44.880]  calmly announced this have a camera watching them in their bedroom to make sure they're good parents
[1:25:44.880 --> 1:25:51.040]  guilty until proven innocent social services set up cctv camera and couples bedroom social
[1:25:51.040 --> 1:25:55.280]  workers set up cct camera in bedroom of couple and they said well we do this to everybody
[1:25:55.280 --> 1:26:01.120]  with learning difficulties in order to monitor their behavior a new report claims and then you
[1:26:01.120 --> 1:26:07.440]  read the article and they admit the social workers say yes they had bad test scores in school
[1:26:07.440 --> 1:26:13.440]  and now they've got a baby and so you have to have the government surveil you so they can look for
[1:26:13.440 --> 1:26:18.400]  anything you're doing wrong to then take your child when the government isn't fit to clean toilets
[1:26:18.400 --> 1:26:23.760]  statistically five times more likely at least in the united states i know it's bad over there as well
[1:26:23.760 --> 1:26:29.600]  to abuse children because they don't care council staff sees these cities running are said to have
[1:26:29.600 --> 1:26:35.280]  spot on young parents at night as part of a plan to see if they were fit to look after their baby
[1:26:37.520 --> 1:26:40.960]  and it goes on the mother and the father were forced to cite the human rights act
[1:26:40.960 --> 1:26:46.000]  which protects the right of life to private life before the social services team they said they
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:51.680]  weren't able to have sex it was because the camera was in the bedroom the social services team back
[1:26:51.680 --> 1:26:55.520]  down and agreed to switch off the surveillance camera while they were in bed together but the
[1:26:55.520 --> 1:27:02.080]  cameras stay on except when they're asleep so see the whole issue is why is there a camera
[1:27:02.080 --> 1:27:06.240]  watching them why do they have to live with cameras watching them this is big brother instead it's
[1:27:06.240 --> 1:27:11.840]  all right when you're sleeping the camera you'll once that you turn the lights out and it goes on
[1:27:11.840 --> 1:27:16.560]  to say that yes in young parents homes now in england as we told you this is the social insurance
[1:27:16.560 --> 1:27:19.840]  what they planned decades ago we read you the documents they're proposing it here
[1:27:21.840 --> 1:27:26.640]  oh well just new parents you know if you're at risk if you're poor uh you know any of these
[1:27:26.640 --> 1:27:31.440]  excuses they call that risk we will surveil you now in the u.s when you go to have a child
[1:27:33.280 --> 1:27:38.000]  they run your credit report it all goes through health department computers that are in the hospitals
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:43.440]  under regulations no law all over the country and they and they ask the wife you got money

[1:33:40.880 --> 1:33:45.760]  in the Fed protests around the country coming up and Ron Paul's speech. So stay with us today.
[1:33:47.280 --> 1:33:52.720]  Let's talk to Forest in the California. You're on the air. Welcome.
[1:33:53.920 --> 1:33:58.560]  Yes, sir, Ralph Jones. I'd like to wish you a happy Thanksgiving weekend.
[1:33:58.560 --> 1:34:06.160]  You too, my friend. Because you are bringing to light and everything I've been talking about
[1:34:06.160 --> 1:34:12.960]  for years now is happening. And regardless of like what we love in life and, you know,
[1:34:12.960 --> 1:34:17.200]  people are fanatical about sports, you know, and all these things they like, you know,
[1:34:17.200 --> 1:34:22.480]  going out and meeting women and, you know, having a family. But, you know, if it wasn't for American
[1:34:22.480 --> 1:34:29.920]  sovereignty and freedom that you all are working so diligently hard every day to save and preserve,
[1:34:29.920 --> 1:34:36.400]  you know, we wouldn't have all this great stuff. So if it wasn't for everybody that sacrificed
[1:34:36.400 --> 1:34:43.840]  before us, we would not even exist right now. Yes, sir. That is the truth. I mean, your guests and
[1:34:44.400 --> 1:34:51.200]  all the people of God are preaching that and teaching that the truth, all creation and it's
[1:34:51.200 --> 1:34:56.480]  going to save this nation and our souls are eternal. And it's like infinite love that you all
[1:34:56.480 --> 1:35:03.520]  have, man. It's amazing. It just makes a country boy like feel happy and all together, you know.
[1:35:04.320 --> 1:35:05.680]  Forest, anything else on your mind?
[1:35:07.440 --> 1:35:14.640]  Yeah, I've been driving a cab now since 1998 and 9-11 severely affected our business. And
[1:35:14.640 --> 1:35:24.080]  my father, an American hard-working man, put it together and, you know, with the money and
[1:35:24.080 --> 1:35:29.680]  everything. And people I've talked to in the cab over the years, a lot of intelligent people here
[1:35:29.680 --> 1:35:35.680]  in the Silicon Valley. And they're pretty much a lot of the things that they've talked about,
[1:35:35.680 --> 1:35:43.920]  is you all put it together and explain it in a good way and back it up with evidence. So, I mean,
[1:35:44.560 --> 1:35:48.240]  this infinite intelligence, man, it's awesome. And we...
[1:35:48.960 --> 1:35:52.720]  Yeah, well, if you hold together or working together is infinite intelligence, and I appreciate
[1:35:52.720 --> 1:35:56.720]  your call. I'm good to hear from you, Forest. I'm Mark in Texas here on the air.
[1:35:56.720 --> 1:36:06.720]  Hey, Mark, go ahead. Put him on hold. We'll go back to him. Let's talk to John and Georgia.
[1:36:06.720 --> 1:36:13.360]  John, go ahead. Hey, Alex, long-time listener. This may sound bizarre, but I've been listening
[1:36:13.360 --> 1:36:18.160]  to Neil Boertz and Rush Limbaugh a bit lately. And they're starting to sound like you these days,
[1:36:19.120 --> 1:36:24.160]  especially concerning the Bush, Obama, McCain bailout or the bomb, as Bob Boertz calls it,
[1:36:24.160 --> 1:36:28.320]  the BOMB. Well, they're being forced to, and I've tuned in some and heard of myself,
[1:36:28.320 --> 1:36:34.240]  because their listeners are all waking up. So, it's now mainstream that we have private banks
[1:36:34.240 --> 1:36:41.120]  raping us. Exactly. Listen, listen, the cops in Dallas were smiling and waving and being friendly
[1:36:41.840 --> 1:36:46.560]  and talking to us and acting like we were human beings. And then we treated them like human beings.
[1:36:47.440 --> 1:36:52.960]  And this smiley police lieutenant, he was about 50 years old, you know, in the suit,
[1:36:52.960 --> 1:36:57.360]  running things. And it wasn't an over-response, too. There's probably only 10 cops out there for
[1:36:57.360 --> 1:37:02.320]  you know, 250 of us. Normally it'd be like 500 cops for 200 of us or something like that.
[1:37:02.320 --> 1:37:07.360]  I'm exaggerating, like 100 cops for 250 of us. I was like, hey, do you know Federal Reserve's
[1:37:07.360 --> 1:37:12.400]  private? And he said, yeah, I sure do. And he goes, I know all about him. He was smiling at me.
[1:37:12.960 --> 1:37:17.600]  So, I mean, they know. And it's happening more and more. And that's what's exciting.
[1:37:17.600 --> 1:37:22.080]  I just think it's a good sign that the mainstream talk radio is now talking about the criminal
[1:37:22.080 --> 1:37:26.560]  bankers and the socialism. And I know how unlikely it would be, but I was just thinking,
[1:37:26.560 --> 1:37:31.600]  if you could get a major talk radio host on your show, that would have a big effect.
[1:37:33.040 --> 1:37:38.640]  Well, Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh and guys like that, sold out to the dark side. They're only,
[1:37:38.640 --> 1:37:42.240]  I mean, it's like Glenn Beck. They saw Glenn Beck at a Fox News show basically talking like
[1:37:42.240 --> 1:37:47.760]  myself or Ron Paul. But notice Beck, one day he'll say, use the military to arrest the 9-11
[1:37:47.760 --> 1:37:52.400]  truthers. They're a threat. And then a month later, he's saying, there's a new world order.
[1:37:52.400 --> 1:37:57.200]  The bankers are taking over. They want to set up a one-world currency. They engineered all this.
[1:37:57.920 --> 1:38:04.160]  But I do appreciate it that Beck gave Ron Paul several hours on his show to just basically
[1:38:04.160 --> 1:38:09.040]  have it say. But when it mattered, when Ron Paul had a chance of winning primaries,
[1:38:09.040 --> 1:38:15.600]  he attacked him and said he was dangerous. Yes, yes. See, we're winning. And I'm always telling
[1:38:15.600 --> 1:38:19.280]  the Liberty movement, the freedom movement, the reality movement, the people that just want to
[1:38:19.280 --> 1:38:26.000]  be free. And we're just normal people. We're not even a movement. I mean, a name is too constraining.
[1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:29.920]  I've always explained to people, we have to be ready to win. And we're a long way away from that.
[1:38:29.920 --> 1:38:34.640]  But the point is, we have the opportunity. We have the capability. We have the information.
[1:38:34.640 --> 1:38:39.760]  We have the truth on our side. 99% of people are going to be hurt by this new world order.
[1:38:39.760 --> 1:38:44.080]  So whether they're an FBI agent or a school teacher or an auto mechanic or a police officer or a
[1:38:44.080 --> 1:38:49.520]  firefighter, we're all in this together. And I'm not lying about any of this. So what do I have to
[1:38:49.520 --> 1:38:53.760]  worry about? I mean, when I say Dinecore runs child kidnapping rings, it was in hundreds of
[1:38:53.760 --> 1:38:59.280]  newspapers, including the Chicago Tribune. What I mean, big, big child kidnapping rings. I'm sorry
[1:38:59.280 --> 1:39:04.240]  if that sounds crazy on the AM and FM dial. I'm sorry if that sounds nuts. It's true. Somebody's
[1:39:04.240 --> 1:39:09.280]  got to stand up for those people because I understand that evil doesn't stop. If you allow evil to
[1:39:09.280 --> 1:39:15.440]  keep growing and you ignore it, it will take over. And so it has to be resisted. We can't have a
[1:39:15.440 --> 1:39:20.960]  culture of corruption. And now it's all coming to a head. And when we've got dire straits, we've
[1:39:20.960 --> 1:39:29.280]  got a very tough road to go down. But as bad as it gets, I am getting very excited. Listen, man,
[1:39:29.280 --> 1:39:34.560]  I'm walking down the street in Dallas. And because of the fried economy on Saturday and Sunday,
[1:39:34.560 --> 1:39:40.000]  in between the in the Fed protests downtown and the grassy Noel and our hotel, that's all in
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:45.200]  about a three square mile area. I guess more than about five, six square mile area. I mean,
[1:39:45.200 --> 1:39:51.120]  I had people all over walking up to me and who lived in Dallas or down there to eat dinner or
[1:39:51.120 --> 1:39:57.520]  down there to go to work who were aware of all this. I mean, just that alone, that amount of
[1:39:57.520 --> 1:40:03.760]  feedback, it's just having an incalculable effect because of you spreading the word out there.
[1:40:03.760 --> 1:40:08.800]  There's more people than ever waking up. I'm seeing it here in Atlanta, Georgia.
[1:40:09.440 --> 1:40:15.120]  What's happening in Atlanta? Well, I mean, we just have, you know, people supporting
[1:40:15.120 --> 1:40:18.320]  Bob Barra, former Georgia Congressman. We have, you know,
[1:40:19.840 --> 1:40:24.640]  there are people here with Ron Paul signs in their front yards and Chuck Baldwin signs
[1:40:24.640 --> 1:40:27.440]  for president in their front yards, even after the election is over.
[1:40:27.440 --> 1:40:34.320]  Well, good job, my friend. Good to hear from you. I appreciate that call. Is Mark back?
[1:40:37.280 --> 1:40:44.880]  Mark in Texas, go ahead. Okay, that's done. Let's go ahead and talk to Tony in Illinois. Tony,
[1:40:44.880 --> 1:40:51.760]  you're on the air. Hi, how are you, Alex? Good, sir. You know, I'm not sorry. What did you say?
[1:40:52.480 --> 1:40:57.120]  I said, go ahead, sir. Okay, thank you. No, I appreciate hearing you. You're very loud.
[1:40:57.120 --> 1:41:01.680]  You're what we used to call back in the 70s and alarmist, but we need alarmist these days.
[1:41:02.240 --> 1:41:07.200]  Well, let me hold on. 7.4 trillion in six weeks stolen by offshore foreign banks,
[1:41:07.200 --> 1:41:10.400]  hoping announcements that they're going to use the U.S. Army against the American people.
[1:41:11.200 --> 1:41:16.080]  Bank runs all over the world. Cancer virus is in the vaccine, fluoride in the water.
[1:41:16.080 --> 1:41:19.280]  I mean, what is there to, I mean, it is alarming, sir.
[1:41:19.280 --> 1:41:24.400]  Definitely, it's alarming. It's very troubling. I'm, of course, calling here from Chicago and
[1:41:24.400 --> 1:41:30.320]  basically what's going on, what's going on with the Chicago machine is somewhat like a
[1:41:30.320 --> 1:41:33.680]  microcosm of what you're speaking about, what's going on there. Well, actually, the Chicago
[1:41:33.680 --> 1:41:40.400]  machine was always a big part of Clinton's makeup in his cabinet and his White House
[1:41:40.960 --> 1:41:45.600]  in his West Wing. Now, it looks like the Chicago machine's going to make up the whole thing.
[1:41:45.600 --> 1:41:50.160]  Basically, very, very basically in control. In fact, I tried to run for public office.
[1:41:50.160 --> 1:41:55.120]  I do have to say, though, that when my uncle was housing secretary, I am Tony Cisneros.
[1:41:55.120 --> 1:42:00.880]  I'm Henry Cisneros's nephew here in Chicago. We have a large family. We go everywhere in the
[1:42:00.880 --> 1:42:05.040]  Hispanic world. But anyway, what I wanted to say is that when he was housing secretary,
[1:42:05.040 --> 1:42:09.280]  the mayor daily tried to put his hand in a pension fund and he federalized HUD,
[1:42:09.280 --> 1:42:13.840]  CHA with HUD, Chicago Housing, with federal housing, so that he could leave the pension
[1:42:13.840 --> 1:42:18.960]  funds back to the pensioners, those that deserved it. And, of course, daily has been in a disagreement.
[1:42:18.960 --> 1:42:23.280]  That's why I've never gotten anywhere politically here in Chicago. And I've tried to run for public
[1:42:23.280 --> 1:42:26.960]  office. I've ran it for Congress twice. But nevertheless, that's not why I called you.
[1:42:26.960 --> 1:42:33.120]  I called you to encourage you to keep on alarming the world. One question that I have to ask you
[1:42:33.120 --> 1:42:36.800]  is that when we do get rid of the Fed and we will eventually get rid of it, because I believe
[1:42:36.800 --> 1:42:43.040]  that when the people are angry enough to speak, that they will overthrow the oppressive government,
[1:42:43.040 --> 1:42:48.880]  as Thomas Jefferson said and a lot of our framers of the Constitution, our forefathers said,
[1:42:48.880 --> 1:42:53.440]  that when people band together, there's nothing in the world that can stop them, nothing.
[1:42:55.440 --> 1:43:01.120]  But my question is when we do get rid of the Fed, we do go back to the gold standard, the silver
[1:43:01.120 --> 1:43:08.000]  standard and sound monetary, which has been historically the standard of currency was
[1:43:08.000 --> 1:43:12.480]  gold and silver, and of course precious stones and so on and so forth. But my question is,
[1:43:12.480 --> 1:43:18.480]  when that happens, who basically, I believe whoever owns most of the gold is basically
[1:43:18.480 --> 1:43:24.240]  going to be in control. And I would like to ask you, who do you think that would be? Or
[1:43:24.240 --> 1:43:29.440]  I mean, do we still have enough gold in our reserves for Knox and in our reserves in our
[1:43:29.440 --> 1:43:33.040]  independent banks? I'm not talking about Federal Reserve. That's a great question.
[1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:40.080]  I have, the best thing to do is to Google or go to YouTube and Google Alex Jones,
[1:43:40.080 --> 1:43:44.400]  the moneymasters, and I had the makers, one of them is a banker, on,
[1:43:44.400 --> 1:43:50.160]  they made the film, the moneymasters, and they break down that they disagree with Ron Paul,
[1:43:50.800 --> 1:43:55.120]  and I see their points. I mean, we should have a public debate about this, that we shouldn't go
[1:43:55.120 --> 1:44:00.320]  to a totally gold-backed currency because the bankers, the private banking families,
[1:44:00.320 --> 1:44:07.360]  predominantly based in Europe, they have cornered the major supplies, the big stockpiles of gold.
[1:44:07.360 --> 1:44:11.680]  Going back to 1933 when they ordered our great grandparents and grandparents to hand their
[1:44:11.680 --> 1:44:17.360]  gold in for paper notes back, they printed up paper money the government did, gave it to us,
[1:44:17.360 --> 1:44:21.200]  and then we had to give them our gold. That was then shipped to Europe because it was illegal for
[1:44:21.200 --> 1:44:25.280]  Americans to own gold and they doubled the price of gold in just one year. That was a huge profit
[1:44:25.280 --> 1:44:31.280]  for the International Crime Syndicate. So, yes, a lot of monetary experts believe we can have a
[1:44:31.280 --> 1:44:37.280]  fiat currency controlled by the government, but educate the public about the money supply,
[1:44:37.280 --> 1:44:43.200]  use a money supply like Lincoln did to actually empower the people because all money really
[1:44:43.200 --> 1:44:49.840]  should be as a symbol of agreed upon exchange so that we can grease the skids and accelerate
[1:44:49.840 --> 1:44:57.040]  the ease of commerce. And so, whereas Ron Paul is an economist in his own right with the Austrian
[1:44:57.040 --> 1:45:03.440]  School, with the Von Mies Institute, and I see his points and understand his arguments,
[1:45:03.440 --> 1:45:09.120]  he himself has said we would have to phase that in. And I tend to lean towards the model,
[1:45:10.400 --> 1:45:16.560]  and the economic reform model, put out by Richard C. Cook, who's a monetary historian
[1:45:16.560 --> 1:45:24.560]  and economist, and that model is similar to the model put out by the makers of the Money Masters,
[1:45:24.560 --> 1:45:29.360]  which by the way we have for sale on infowars.com on DVD. It's three and a half hours long, but
[1:45:29.360 --> 1:45:33.440]  folks can also watch it for free floating around on the web. But that's an important three and a
[1:45:33.440 --> 1:45:37.360]  half hours to watch, and at the end they have the monetary plan, and people can say, well,
[1:45:37.360 --> 1:45:41.360]  that's boring monetary plans. Well, your whole life depends on it. Our whole future depends on it
[1:45:41.360 --> 1:45:47.360]  for the listeners. We better get control of this or it's over. But going back, you're saying Mr.
[1:45:47.360 --> 1:45:55.360]  Cisneros is your father? No, he's my third uncle. Okay, he's your uncle. My grandfather was a
[1:45:55.360 --> 1:46:02.880]  Mexican revolutionary, but he was under Venustiano Carranza. He's basically the author of the Mexican
[1:46:02.880 --> 1:46:09.120]  Revolutionary Constitution. That's an effect that Vicente Fox was basically subject to himself under.
[1:46:09.120 --> 1:46:13.440]  He was at least the last one. But yeah, but anyway, he was a revolutionary, which would call a
[1:46:13.440 --> 1:46:17.600]  land-owning conservative revolutionary, because when my grandparents came over, they did have
[1:46:17.600 --> 1:46:23.280]  gold pieces that were confiscated when Roosevelt passed the gold confiscation act.
[1:46:23.280 --> 1:46:27.520]  Absolutely. That happened, and people didn't know. Why do you think they targeted Cisneros?
[1:46:27.520 --> 1:46:33.040]  I'm not saying he's perfect, but it's kind of like the New York governor went after the bankers,
[1:46:33.040 --> 1:46:37.360]  and so they shut him down, and I had heard they went after Cisneros because he didn't go along
[1:46:37.360 --> 1:46:42.240]  with Daley. Is that what you heard inside the family? Basically, yes. He did not want to play
[1:46:42.240 --> 1:46:46.640]  ball with the machine, and he appealed to Bill Clinton, and Bill Clinton said, well, look,
[1:46:46.640 --> 1:46:51.760]  I appointed you housing secretary, not Daley. So that's when my uncle basically came in and
[1:46:51.760 --> 1:46:58.640]  federalized Chicago housing with HUD to protect the pension funds of the pensioners.
[1:46:58.640 --> 1:47:03.680]  When they're now in the media today, blaming Cisneros, and I'm not defending Cisneros because
[1:47:03.680 --> 1:47:09.360]  you're his nephew, I mean, I'm not saying he's perfect. The point is blaming him
[1:47:09.360 --> 1:47:16.000]  for what the central banks did, selling derivatives off of the loans, has nothing to do
[1:47:16.000 --> 1:47:21.600]  with HUD and with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. That's another red herring.
[1:47:22.160 --> 1:47:22.800]  That's correct.
[1:47:23.840 --> 1:47:31.600]  That's correct. My desire is to run again here in Chicago within the next major
[1:47:31.600 --> 1:47:36.480]  election for citywide office. I'm looking to run for city treasurer to get at least the city back
[1:47:36.480 --> 1:47:44.160]  on sound footing, financial footing. Of course, Miriam Santos, the last Hispanic treasurer,
[1:47:44.160 --> 1:47:49.360]  Daley had set her up where they eliminated her all because she had gotten more votes than him.
[1:47:49.360 --> 1:47:53.360]  That was basically the road of it. Daley hates competition. He hates anybody that's going to
[1:47:53.360 --> 1:47:57.360]  get more votes because that would be thrown into him. Nobody's going to argue with you.
[1:47:57.360 --> 1:48:03.040]  I mean, his dad was the mob boss of Chicago. Thank you. And although he would, yes, you're
[1:48:03.040 --> 1:48:06.960]  right. You're right. Very, very controlled with the mafia, very controlled with the,
[1:48:08.160 --> 1:48:11.680]  and of course, behind the mafia, I think you already should know who's behind the mafia.
[1:48:11.680 --> 1:48:18.320]  I mean, what would be the Sicilian mafia? I mean, come on. And it gets into the religious aspect
[1:48:18.320 --> 1:48:23.600]  of the religion. It gets into the P2 Lodge in the Vatican. Thank you. Amen. You just said it.
[1:48:23.600 --> 1:48:29.200]  Basically, that's it. All Sicilians or Italians, they're not Lutherans or Presbyterians or even
[1:48:29.200 --> 1:48:35.040]  Baptists. So that should give you, and that's why my concern is that if we do get back on the
[1:48:35.040 --> 1:48:40.800]  gold standard, come on. The Satanic Vatican has controlled gold for the last 18th century.
[1:48:40.800 --> 1:48:45.360]  They've been collecting it. Come on. 18th century's collecting gold. You know they're going to have
[1:48:45.360 --> 1:48:48.880]  some power, some saying what's going on when we do get back on the gold standard. That's
[1:48:48.880 --> 1:48:53.600]  why my concern is that the people have the gold, the people have the silver, the people have
[1:48:53.600 --> 1:48:59.200]  real estate, the people have basically hard assets. You know what I'm saying? Oh, I'm listening to
[1:48:59.200 --> 1:49:03.600]  you and I agree with you. And call back sometime, Tony. It's good to have you on board the show.
[1:49:03.600 --> 1:49:07.680]  Let's talk to Shawna in Florida. You're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[1:49:07.680 --> 1:49:13.760]  Hi. Thanks for taking my call, Alex. I love your show. Just discovered it recently. Listen,
[1:49:13.760 --> 1:49:21.920]  I wanted to discuss this martial law thing, that report that came out, suggesting that we don't
[1:49:21.920 --> 1:49:28.560]  have the proper defenses and all that. And I wanted to offer an alternative, if I might.
[1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:35.680]  I was in Iraq just recently, just a few months ago, and I was serving at St. Com.
[1:49:35.680 --> 1:49:41.840]  And while I was there, I watched a transformation happen where
[1:49:43.920 --> 1:49:47.760]  the guarding of the posts, the guarding of the dining facilities,
[1:49:48.720 --> 1:49:53.600]  local national escorts, things like that, that are normally handled by the US military with
[1:49:53.600 --> 1:50:00.560]  live rounds, were handed over to a private contracting firm called EODT. They employ a bunch
[1:50:00.560 --> 1:50:06.320]  of non-English speaking people, and it created a lot of havoc. And as far as I know, it has not
[1:50:06.320 --> 1:50:11.680]  changed. Yeah, they're bringing us into a mercenary force. Exactly. And here's the deal.
[1:50:12.240 --> 1:50:18.320]  While I was there, this is what forced me to leave. I went as an IT professional to handle
[1:50:19.280 --> 1:50:24.880]  some issues at St. Com that they were having with their network. What forced me to leave early
[1:50:24.880 --> 1:50:31.520]  was they started shooting people on the base, Alex. I'm not kidding. And here's the thing.
[1:50:31.520 --> 1:50:35.280]  No, no. I mean, you're saying contractors would get drunk and go out and just kill people for
[1:50:35.280 --> 1:50:39.200]  fun. No, no, they're not allowed to drink over there. I mean, it's... Well, stay there. Stay
[1:50:39.200 --> 1:50:42.640]  there. Stay there. Well, there's been reports in the press that come out of the green zone drunk
[1:50:42.640 --> 1:50:47.520]  and start blasting people. Don't hang up. Sean, I want to hear about this when we get back. Stay with us.

[1:52:16.960 --> 1:52:21.920]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[1:52:23.120 --> 1:52:26.640]  An inside job. How dare you?
[1:52:26.640 --> 1:52:33.360]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.

[1:54:01.680 --> 1:54:09.120]  Okay, Shawna in Florida. What are their 220,000 contractors? Last government number I saw
[1:54:09.120 --> 1:54:19.280]  in Iraq, 160,000 U.S. personnel. And that's just what we know about. Okay, continue your story,
[1:54:19.280 --> 1:54:27.360]  please. Okay, now here's the deal. The ELDT guys are a bunch of Ugandan mercenaries. Okay,
[1:54:27.360 --> 1:54:33.120]  that's who they brought in to protect our troops on the basis. The press is not allowed on the
[1:54:33.120 --> 1:54:38.320]  victory-based compound, which is where central command is located. It is where I was. I worked
[1:54:38.320 --> 1:54:44.880]  in St. Com, stepped from General Petraeus when he was there. And here's the deal. We just signed
[1:54:44.880 --> 1:54:52.080]  it over. They're ratifying the security pact over there that President Bush signed that allows
[1:54:52.880 --> 1:54:59.920]  cargo shipments and aid shipments and things like that to be searched and seized. And they're
[1:54:59.920 --> 1:55:04.880]  going to pull everybody back to the bases in June, making them sitting duck. And here's the
[1:55:04.880 --> 1:55:10.240]  problem that I see, Alex. Everybody that's over there. Now, the base that I was on supported a
[1:55:10.240 --> 1:55:17.040]  lot of people. They have their rifle or their sidearm, depending on what they were issued,
[1:55:17.040 --> 1:55:23.040]  and one clip. And they're not allowed to keep their clip inside of their weapon. And the only
[1:55:23.040 --> 1:55:30.480]  people that are carrying weapons that are locked and loaded are the contractors that are supposed
[1:55:30.480 --> 1:55:35.840]  to be protecting the base. What happens when we pull these guys in and they're sitting duck?
[1:55:36.880 --> 1:55:39.040]  Well, tell me about who's getting shot on the basis.
[1:55:40.560 --> 1:55:44.080]  The three that happened within a week of each other, by the way.
[1:55:45.280 --> 1:55:53.360]  One was a U.S. soldier, 19 years old, a private, coming out of the gym. And the official story
[1:55:53.360 --> 1:56:00.560]  was Shray Bullet from off base, which was impossible where the gym is located. Well,
[1:56:00.560 --> 1:56:04.800]  have you seen all these reports of a murdering Marine Corps and Army investigators
[1:56:04.800 --> 1:56:13.200]  of corruptions by the hundreds? I saw, I wore the blood of one of the people shot.
[1:56:13.200 --> 1:56:18.400]  That is why I left. They pulled me onto the Perfume Palace, which is where they do their
[1:56:18.400 --> 1:56:26.080]  intelligence. They debriefed me and told me what I saw. And it's not what I saw.
[1:56:26.080 --> 1:56:29.920]  What's really going on? There's arguments between the U.S. forces and the Ugandans?
[1:56:30.720 --> 1:56:35.120]  No. Ugandans aren't even forces. They're just mercenaries that EODT hired.
[1:56:35.120 --> 1:56:39.760]  Well, then who's shooting the troops and why? Who's killing troops on the base?
[1:56:40.560 --> 1:56:43.840]  EODT. EODT.
[1:56:45.200 --> 1:56:47.200]  You're saying the mercenary forces?
[1:56:47.200 --> 1:56:54.000]  Absolutely. And I'll tell you what, these Blackwater pigs, you know, I dealt with
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:57:00.080]  those guys firsthand. They would come on base. And I'm a 32-year-old Norwegian descent,
[1:57:00.080 --> 1:57:03.280]  you know, Native Minnesotans, you know, all American looking girl.
[1:57:03.280 --> 1:57:06.880]  These guys would come on base and I'm a professional. And they would treat me like
[1:57:06.880 --> 1:57:12.080]  I was the freaking entertainment. And two of them, two of them tried to force me.
[1:57:13.440 --> 1:57:15.280]  You know, and nobody did anything about it.
[1:57:15.280 --> 1:57:19.440]  No, it's total, we see these reports, it's total lawlessness, it's a force of evil.
[1:57:19.440 --> 1:57:27.600]  We had a serial rapist that attacked and raped 25 people on that, 25 women on that base in 32 days.
[1:57:30.080 --> 1:57:32.000]  What the hell is going on?
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:33.360]  Evil is going on.
[1:57:33.360 --> 1:57:36.240]  And they're gonna, you know what, I hate to be the alarmist here,
[1:57:37.360 --> 1:57:42.320]  but you know what, this martial law thing? Tell me, if they have all of our troops sitting over
[1:57:42.320 --> 1:57:48.400]  there, you know, in a position to probably be extinguished in a couple of bad places.
[1:57:48.400 --> 1:57:50.080]  That's what I was gonna say next.
[1:57:50.080 --> 1:57:51.520]  I mean, come on.
[1:57:51.520 --> 1:57:55.040]  No, no, no. It's in mainstream news. They're gonna use foreign,
[1:57:55.040 --> 1:58:00.400]  Czech Republic, Mexican, Canadian troops here. And the Canadian press reported last week that
[1:58:00.400 --> 1:58:03.760]  their people are being told US troops will be used against them.
[1:58:03.760 --> 1:58:06.080]  True. That's not even true. And I'll tell you why.
[1:58:07.360 --> 1:58:11.280]  They're gonna take these security firms because there's a hell of a lot more of them over there
[1:58:11.280 --> 1:58:18.080]  than you know. This stuff has been reported. I saw it first-hand, and press is not allowed on that base.
[1:58:19.440 --> 1:58:19.920]  It's over there.
[1:58:19.920 --> 1:58:22.560]  Well, stay there. Stay there. I want to hear more. We're back in one minute.
[1:58:22.560 --> 1:58:28.320]  What's happening is this is all a laboratory. Iraq's a laboratory to test taking over the United States.
[1:58:31.520 --> 1:58:33.280]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[1:58:36.240 --> 1:58:38.480]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:38.480 --> 1:58:47.600]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:58:47.600 --> 1:58:51.840]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:58:51.840 --> 1:58:53.680]  Bin Laden. This is his MO.
[1:58:53.680 --> 1:58:56.960]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:58:56.960 --> 1:59:01.840]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[1:59:01.840 --> 1:59:06.640]  networks inside the United States. Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis
[1:59:06.640 --> 1:59:10.400]  again very much engaged in spying in and on the US.
[1:59:10.960 --> 1:59:14.800]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:59:14.800 --> 1:59:18.560]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI,
[1:59:18.560 --> 1:59:21.680]  the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[1:59:21.680 --> 1:59:24.960]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[1:59:24.960 --> 1:59:30.400]  Fabled Enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com. Forsee it in super high quality,

[1:59:33.920 --> 1:59:37.360]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[2:00:03.920 --> 2:00:10.000]  G-C-N Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:11.920 --> 2:00:16.000]  General Barry McCaffrey, General Wesley Clark, and others on record,
[2:00:16.000 --> 2:00:19.600]  we've documented all the links. Up now, it's a men's cream nose.
[2:00:21.280 --> 2:00:25.680]  Have said they will use foreign troops. Now, they're using Latin American death squads.
[2:00:25.680 --> 2:00:30.320]  I've seen the press Pakistani troops, African troops in Iraq.
[2:00:30.320 --> 2:00:35.920]  They also have Blackwater and others recruiting all over the world.
[2:00:36.720 --> 2:00:39.840]  And they've said they plan to use them here domestically.
[2:00:39.840 --> 2:00:42.240]  So that's mainstream news. It's true.
[2:00:42.880 --> 2:00:46.400]  CBS News today, military examining using troops in the United States.
[2:00:46.400 --> 2:00:50.240]  It's already been announced. They're just now putting it on CBS News, whitewashing it.
[2:00:50.240 --> 2:00:54.080]  And we were talking, and are talking to Sean in Florida, who just got back from Iraq.
[2:00:54.800 --> 2:00:58.800]  And during the last one-minute break, I wanted to get down to brass tacks with her.
[2:00:58.800 --> 2:01:03.360]  And I basically said, so let me guess, these guys, she said, let me tell you,
[2:01:03.360 --> 2:01:04.880]  before I could even ask the question, I was going to say,
[2:01:05.600 --> 2:01:08.320]  what you're getting at is your prisoners on the base to them.
[2:01:08.320 --> 2:01:11.680]  I couldn't get the question out. She said exactly what I was about to ask,
[2:01:11.680 --> 2:01:15.600]  without me even posing it. Tell me, tell the listeners what you just told me during the
[2:01:15.600 --> 2:01:20.960]  break about how you've got to show your ID to them, but then their IDs are fake names.
[2:01:20.960 --> 2:01:27.040]  Explain that the troops and the contractors, the Americans are prisoners to the foreign troops.
[2:01:27.040 --> 2:01:31.520]  Explain that. Okay. Let's first of all declare that they are not foreign troops.
[2:01:32.160 --> 2:01:36.960]  Okay. They are foreign mercenaries. They are independent contractors. Okay.
[2:01:37.520 --> 2:01:40.960]  They're privately paid mercenaries. Okay. Let's call it what it is.
[2:01:41.760 --> 2:01:48.400]  But in order to enter any facility, whether it's the dining hall, the store,
[2:01:49.840 --> 2:01:52.080]  and in my case, the palace, because that's where I worked.
[2:01:52.080 --> 2:01:57.440]  And with the palace, I had to carry a second ID. Fortunately, in the palace,
[2:01:57.440 --> 2:02:02.080]  we had the Tonga Marines guarded the palace, but aside from that, the only people carrying
[2:02:02.080 --> 2:02:06.800]  live weapons or mercenaries. And they were there.
[2:02:06.800 --> 2:02:10.880]  I mean, before they used Delta Force and others to be above the military chain of command,
[2:02:10.880 --> 2:02:16.240]  now they just use foreigners. Explain what they do. Tell the listeners.
[2:02:16.240 --> 2:02:22.000]  Okay. What they do is they stand guard at any facility and they use the excuse that
[2:02:22.000 --> 2:02:27.120]  we could be sneaking into bomb the DFAC, the dining facility.
[2:02:27.920 --> 2:02:34.080]  So you have to stand in line, show them your ID, and they verify that your military ID matches
[2:02:34.800 --> 2:02:37.200]  your picture, your picture matches your face, so on and so forth.
[2:02:38.560 --> 2:02:42.000]  And then they let you in to eat or let you in to shop or whatever else.
[2:02:43.360 --> 2:02:48.320]  These guys don't have, they're called cat cards, common access cards.
[2:02:48.320 --> 2:02:54.480]  They don't have the cat card. I still have my cat card, but anyway, they don't have a cat card.
[2:02:54.480 --> 2:03:01.440]  What they have is a little strip across their shoulder that just defines their name.
[2:03:01.440 --> 2:03:04.960]  Now, if you look at any military soldier, it's got their last name.
[2:03:05.600 --> 2:03:07.680]  These guys, it has their first name and a number.
[2:03:08.480 --> 2:03:12.240]  Fred 475, Emmanuel 163, whatever the case may be.
[2:03:12.240 --> 2:03:19.120]  And we were told that it's because their names in whatever Swahili or whatever, we wouldn't recognize.
[2:03:19.120 --> 2:03:23.120]  Also, they claim, and this has been confirmed in the press,
[2:03:24.320 --> 2:03:29.760]  they claim immunity above all laws. Now, the troops are under the uniform, you know, military code.
[2:03:29.760 --> 2:03:34.800]  So are the contractors, exactly the contractor mercenaries are above the law.
[2:03:34.800 --> 2:03:38.880]  And that's why there's all these videos of them shooting children for fun and all of that.
[2:03:38.880 --> 2:03:42.400]  Oh, they're shooting right on the freaking base, and I just, I...
[2:03:42.400 --> 2:03:44.800]  So they're literally gods and just do whatever they want.
[2:03:44.800 --> 2:03:49.600]  Yeah, and here's the thing, when I was over there, I had to go through the Countess Replacement Center
[2:03:49.600 --> 2:03:54.800]  at Fort Benning, Georgia, go through some training, you know, about how to handle yourself in a combat zone.
[2:03:55.920 --> 2:04:01.520]  And it was very clearly explained to me that I was held to the same standard as a soldier,
[2:04:02.320 --> 2:04:07.440]  you know, under the uniform, you know, code, and these guys are not.
[2:04:07.440 --> 2:04:13.760]  And I went through CRC with some of the, some of the replacement security guys when they had that
[2:04:13.760 --> 2:04:17.920]  black water kind of backlash and everything. They brought in some additional guys.
[2:04:18.880 --> 2:04:26.400]  These guys are just the sickest people I have ever met. I spent a week with them in Fort Benning,
[2:04:26.400 --> 2:04:31.360]  and then I ended up, you go to Kuwait for staging. I spent a week with them in Kuwait,
[2:04:31.360 --> 2:04:38.480]  where it's just jealous. And on the base in Kuwait, these guys are so scary.
[2:04:39.120 --> 2:04:44.160]  And the whole government worldwide is collapsing and just criminality is flooding into all the
[2:04:44.160 --> 2:04:47.760]  departments of power. I want to hear a little bit more, stay with us. This is key information.

[2:07:50.400 --> 2:07:56.080]  Ease the T-rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:07:57.760 --> 2:08:05.120]  The global corporate controllers know what they're doing. Hitler to get power took the street thugs,
[2:08:05.120 --> 2:08:11.280]  the criminals, mercenaries, the veterans of World War I, and he formed the SA.
[2:08:12.640 --> 2:08:17.840]  And they stormed the power, beating people up, shooting people, attacking, intimidating,
[2:08:18.400 --> 2:08:24.640]  threatening phone calls, burning down shops. His domestic spy force. That's what Obama is
[2:08:24.640 --> 2:08:29.680]  announcing. And again, they set it up back under Clinton and Bush expanded it. They all work on
[2:08:29.680 --> 2:08:36.320]  the same team. It's all staged. Now, last time I checked, $60-plus billion. That was about a year
[2:08:36.320 --> 2:08:41.520]  ago. We shoot another report on that and pull it back up at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[2:08:41.520 --> 2:08:47.040]  But remember, every month, billions and billions of dollars and $100 bills on Giant C-130s,
[2:08:47.680 --> 2:08:51.280]  and they give a private to stay quiet and go along with all the corruption.
[2:08:51.280 --> 2:08:55.840]  About 30 grand a year. They give different grades of sergeants, hundreds of thousands.
[2:08:55.840 --> 2:09:02.960]  And they give the colonels, in some cases, millions. The generals, it's untold.
[2:09:04.000 --> 2:09:10.720]  So they want to pay off the troops. They want to pay off the officers to go along with the
[2:09:10.720 --> 2:09:15.600]  mercenaries and the killings of army investigators and the killings of Marine Corps investigators.
[2:09:15.600 --> 2:09:19.200]  I mean, I've seen reports where you'll have 20-something investigators killed in one year
[2:09:19.200 --> 2:09:24.560]  at one base. I mean, they blow their heads off in their rooms or in the dorm,
[2:09:24.560 --> 2:09:29.360]  and then say they killed themselves. And this is done by design, just like
[2:09:30.160 --> 2:09:34.800]  Delta Force and other clandestine groups all over the U.S. went into police chief
[2:09:34.800 --> 2:09:39.120]  sheriffs and others and said, look, we just want you to be our friend with what's coming in the
[2:09:39.120 --> 2:09:45.840]  future. We want to give you $100,000. And the people are like, is this a sting? Is this a setup?
[2:09:45.840 --> 2:09:50.400]  They go, no. Department of Defense, National Security, just work with us in some covert
[2:09:50.400 --> 2:09:55.200]  training with your police. Let us do domestic operations, secret operations in your town,
[2:09:56.000 --> 2:10:02.080]  and we want to give you briefcases of cash. And then police chiefs, we've interviewed,
[2:10:02.080 --> 2:10:08.640]  it's in some of my films, police state 2000, they say no. Then they find out fire chiefs,
[2:10:08.640 --> 2:10:13.680]  mayors, they are taking the money. See, we only hear about those people that say no.
[2:10:14.320 --> 2:10:19.840]  And once you've taken 50 grand, 100 grand, 200 grand, they're now, oh, you want an investigation
[2:10:19.840 --> 2:10:26.720]  about that money you took? We want you to shut down this drug investigation. We want you to go
[2:10:26.720 --> 2:10:32.560]  arrest this person. You see how this works? And a lot of these police chiefs and others,
[2:10:32.560 --> 2:10:39.360]  they don't know what to do. When there is a army colonel in their office, this is going back decades
[2:10:39.360 --> 2:10:44.640]  ago with a satchel of cash. And they'll give them numbers. They'll say, here's the cards,
[2:10:44.640 --> 2:10:49.760]  you can call the commanding general. Here's a presidential letter. Now, if you take this,
[2:10:49.760 --> 2:10:52.640]  I need you to sign a national security agreement, not to say anything about this.
[2:10:53.840 --> 2:10:56.720]  And a lot of them think, well, if it's the government, it must be okay. My wife would
[2:10:56.720 --> 2:11:03.360]  like 100 grand. So they're everywhere. They run it all. They're all around you.
[2:11:04.400 --> 2:11:08.160]  Okay. And now they're going to come out in the open with army brigades on the streets. And it's
[2:11:08.160 --> 2:11:16.320]  just, oh, why is the army down here? I mean, I remember in 1999, 98, people would bring me
[2:11:16.320 --> 2:11:20.560]  videos. You know, they'd just be down at Fiesta down in San Antonio, you know, downtown on the
[2:11:20.560 --> 2:11:25.520]  riverwalk. And there'd be army and Air Force MPs would just walk up and say, we want to check
[2:11:25.520 --> 2:11:29.920]  everybody's IDs. And they'd have police with them. They'd randomly do that. But they'd set up
[2:11:29.920 --> 2:11:34.960]  checkpoints. And then we got video of it. And then it was on the news. Oh, the army, the Air Force
[2:11:34.960 --> 2:11:39.200]  police are helping. Oh, they're helping at accidents. And so now you hear, oh, yeah, the army
[2:11:39.200 --> 2:11:42.960]  brigades, they're going to help with the jaws of life, get people out of crash cars. And
[2:11:43.920 --> 2:11:47.840]  they're going to keep you safe. And they're going to help the police. And but then overall,
[2:11:47.840 --> 2:11:53.200]  oh, they're going to fight terrorism. And they're going to take your ranchers, your farms, your
[2:11:53.200 --> 2:11:58.400]  car dealerships, your restaurants. I mean, this is just old fashioned hardcore criminality.
[2:11:58.400 --> 2:12:05.440]  And see, they want this devil doggish group of paid off mercs, even the military are mercs. Now,
[2:12:05.440 --> 2:12:09.200]  in the combat units, the ones getting paid off and supply units and people that are in key
[2:12:09.200 --> 2:12:13.040]  infrastructure. But anyways, finishing up is I want to get everybody else, Sean. You should
[2:12:13.040 --> 2:12:20.400]  anonymously write up an article with the basics and post it on prisonplanet.com forum. You should
[2:12:20.400 --> 2:12:24.960]  go there and or if you want to go totally public, do that. But this stuff's all been in the news.
[2:12:24.960 --> 2:12:28.800]  What you're telling me has been in the news in triplicate, and they just whitewash it. So the
[2:12:28.800 --> 2:12:35.360]  Iraq theater is about corrupting our troops, about training them to accept Bolivian and Paraguayan
[2:12:36.480 --> 2:12:42.800]  and Colombian mercenaries from the death squads in the 80s. It's about the acceptance of Ugandan
[2:12:42.800 --> 2:12:52.480]  troops and South African troops and Pakistani troops. And you mentioned Marines from other
[2:12:52.480 --> 2:12:58.320]  countries. It's all about just changing the culture. They are, they're moving everything to
[2:12:58.320 --> 2:13:04.800]  drones, pilotless aircraft, pilotless tanks. They are moving everything to what small groups can
[2:13:04.800 --> 2:13:10.000]  control. And yes, I am aware that Blackwater and a lot of other groups, they end up being above the
[2:13:10.000 --> 2:13:13.920]  rest of the troops, they end up running the security. The foreign merc groups now Blackwater
[2:13:13.920 --> 2:13:18.640]  worldwide, no longer US, but but it's even more over with the Pakistanis and the Africans.
[2:13:18.640 --> 2:13:26.640]  And it's like for at least 30 years, one Israeli company guards all the nukes at the United States
[2:13:26.640 --> 2:13:32.720]  in the Army and the Marines and the Air Force and the Navy. They guard the nukes. See, everything's
[2:13:32.720 --> 2:13:38.400]  being taken out of US hands. Panama Canal given to China. China, I saw reports last week taking
[2:13:38.400 --> 2:13:43.680]  over all the ports they didn't control. The Arabs taking over ports, you know, the,
[2:13:43.680 --> 2:13:50.000]  you know, the son of the Chinese president running a US port. That's how they globalist
[2:13:50.000 --> 2:13:55.040]  get control. They move their people in, in slow motion, creeping death. You understand?
[2:13:57.280 --> 2:14:02.880]  I want to bring Shauna back up. Shauna, you still there? I am. And thanks for continuing to listen
[2:14:02.880 --> 2:14:08.400]  because I've, I've been sitting on this without an, you know, with a lot of fear. You know, I,
[2:14:08.400 --> 2:14:16.080]  I did see several suicides and I, whatever, while I was there, you know, and I, I saw
[2:14:16.080 --> 2:14:21.520]  so many things and the day that I left, you know, I hate to admit this, but I, I had a,
[2:14:23.440 --> 2:14:28.880]  I had someone fake a Red Cross message to me so that I could get out under emergency circumstances
[2:14:30.080 --> 2:14:35.120]  because I was very fearful that something was going to happen to me after what I had seen.
[2:14:35.120 --> 2:14:42.480]  Now are, were these suicides suspicious? They were very suspicious. And I also want to mention
[2:14:42.480 --> 2:14:46.160]  one more thing that I think is really important to note now that we're going to, you know, have
[2:14:46.160 --> 2:14:52.800]  all of our guys combined to their bases or confined. While I was there, you know, there's a CRIM
[2:14:53.680 --> 2:14:57.280]  program going on over there where they try to intercept mortar shells and rockets that are
[2:14:57.280 --> 2:15:03.120]  incoming. I saw a lot of mortars and a lot of rockets. Now that's a radar system that triangulates.
[2:15:03.120 --> 2:15:08.720]  Right. And it, and it also fires, you know, a shoot down, you know, anti trajectory thing.
[2:15:08.720 --> 2:15:13.520]  But anyway, I'm not a weapons person, so I don't get it, but I did see it in action.
[2:15:14.560 --> 2:15:20.480]  Not very effective, but there was one day when the CRIM guys were there and they were there to
[2:15:21.120 --> 2:15:26.640]  shake hands with General Petraeus in the palace. That particular night, the CRIM that was close
[2:15:26.640 --> 2:15:36.160]  to my quarters was taken down for maintenance. And we received the largest number of incoming
[2:15:37.280 --> 2:15:47.360]  that we ever did on that base. Now, how is that possible that if these guys are there for maintenance
[2:15:47.360 --> 2:15:50.800]  that we're taking all this incoming? Let me, let me tell you what happened. Have you seen
[2:15:50.800 --> 2:15:55.520]  my film Terror Storm? Yes, I actually watched it last night. Thank you for making that available.
[2:15:55.520 --> 2:16:00.720]  Sure, sure. Did you, did you see how they keep catching Israeli and British and US
[2:16:00.720 --> 2:16:05.760]  mercenaries, but regular SAS as well, regular British troops dressed up with fake beards,
[2:16:05.760 --> 2:16:10.640]  attacking US troops? It would kill me. Well, no, listen, this is what they do.
[2:16:10.640 --> 2:16:16.240]  There was never really a real war. Okay. I mean, there's a few quote insurgents and people fighting,
[2:16:16.240 --> 2:16:20.160]  but that's how they do it. They say, oh, we can't leave because thousands are dying, you know,
[2:16:20.160 --> 2:16:25.680]  Iraq is a day, hundreds of US troops a month, we have to fix it. And then now they say, oh,
[2:16:25.680 --> 2:16:30.880]  see, we had the victory. We did fix it. No, they just cut back. And I mean, this is confirmed
[2:16:30.880 --> 2:16:35.840]  in mainstream news. No, they just have mercenaries. Most the kills have been our troops being killed
[2:16:35.840 --> 2:16:40.320]  by the mercs. I know. And you know what kills me is, you know, I volunteered some time with
[2:16:40.320 --> 2:16:44.640]  the mortuary chaplain. But see, that's the same thing. It's like they have bodies. I saw what
[2:16:44.640 --> 2:16:49.040]  the hell is going on over there. And while this is, you know, some of it's hitting the mainstream
[2:16:49.040 --> 2:16:57.280]  news, newspapers and any reporters are not allowed on this base. Because it's so evil. No one could
[2:16:57.280 --> 2:17:01.280]  ever believe that they're actually doing this. But I feel like a psycho when I see these things
[2:17:01.280 --> 2:17:06.240]  out loud because I think that this can't possibly be true. They've caught Israeli, they've caught
[2:17:06.240 --> 2:17:12.080]  Israeli troops, British troops and mercenaries attacking the Marines and the army over and over
[2:17:12.080 --> 2:17:18.560]  again. Listen, listen, they've caught them. It's admitted. Look, I know, I don't even get to this.
[2:17:18.560 --> 2:17:26.000]  I didn't even get to this. I didn't even get to this in Kosovo. Even the people the CIA brought in
[2:17:26.640 --> 2:17:32.400]  now want them out. So what did they do? They had the German troops, German intelligence dress up
[2:17:33.360 --> 2:17:38.240]  like Serbs. And they had them over the weekend. This is Reuters, by the way, this is caught.
[2:17:38.240 --> 2:17:44.320]  They were caught because see now people are learning about this. The other UN troops caught them
[2:17:44.320 --> 2:17:49.280]  attacking the UN base and they shot them up and wounded some and caught them.
[2:17:51.280 --> 2:17:59.760]  Rocket attacking, hang grenade bombing NATO and UN bases. Now, why are they doing that?
[2:18:00.400 --> 2:18:04.560]  It took a day or two for that to come out that the German intelligence had staged that for NATO.
[2:18:05.120 --> 2:18:08.400]  But see the NATO people on NATO base don't know they're being attacked by their own people.
[2:18:08.400 --> 2:18:15.040]  So they could beef up troops to have a new crackdown in Kosovo. See, that's how it works.
[2:18:15.040 --> 2:18:21.280]  Why did one in group of Denver cops dress up and attack other cops? And then we found out,
[2:18:21.280 --> 2:18:24.960]  because the cops blew the whistle. They said, I don't appreciate the fact that cops came in here
[2:18:24.960 --> 2:18:29.200]  dressed up and attacked us. They didn't tell the cops they were attacking. That was Denver post.
[2:18:29.200 --> 2:18:35.200]  See, everything is run like this. This is a, they're testing this. They're testing it,
[2:18:35.200 --> 2:18:39.040]  Shauna. And imagine knowing this all these years and people don't believe me.
[2:18:40.160 --> 2:18:46.160]  Imagine knowing the government isn't a government. It is a psycho group run by top
[2:18:46.160 --> 2:18:52.800]  psych warfare experts. They're, and they're so smart and they're so crazy and they're so wicked
[2:18:52.800 --> 2:18:58.000]  and they're so gung-ho. I mean, they are just, I mean, you talked about being around these
[2:18:58.000 --> 2:19:03.120]  mercs. You said they were so horrible. How were they? They were awful. They were the scariest
[2:19:03.120 --> 2:19:09.200]  people I have ever come in contact with. You know, and I didn't believe that human beings could behave
[2:19:09.200 --> 2:19:14.560]  that way outside of a Hollywood film. Well, as bad as what you saw, Halliburton and Dinecore,
[2:19:14.560 --> 2:19:19.040]  out of Iraq, out of Eastern Europe, hundreds of thousands of women and children a year. That's,
[2:19:19.040 --> 2:19:23.600]  that's, that's, that's mainstream headlines. Chicago Tribune, Boyders, all of it. You know what
[2:19:23.600 --> 2:19:27.120]  else needs to be pointed out here? And I think that this is something that other people just
[2:19:27.120 --> 2:19:35.600]  don't freaking know. Alex is that KDR, who I hate. Also, they have nothing but slave labor.
[2:19:35.600 --> 2:19:41.040]  They have Indians and Filipinos that they import for and pay them no money. Listen, listen, a lot
[2:19:41.040 --> 2:19:45.360]  of those people were kidnapped. No, that was in the news. Hold on. I know we've got other
[2:19:45.360 --> 2:19:52.640]  callers. This is important. You saw slaves. I want to hear about this. Santa, Christmas Eve and you

[2:20:52.800 --> 2:20:58.320]  a terrorist act of war against this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[2:20:58.880 --> 2:21:04.000]  But who is the enemy? Bin Laden. This is his MO. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to
[2:21:04.000 --> 2:21:09.360]  look to Osama Bin Laden. Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist
[2:21:09.360 --> 2:21:14.320]  ties to intelligence networks inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that
[2:21:14.320 --> 2:21:20.960]  there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some
[2:21:20.960 --> 2:21:26.320]  Israeli citizens have been detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to
[2:21:26.320 --> 2:21:31.360]  the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games,
[2:21:31.360 --> 2:21:37.120]  the shadow government and much, much more. Fabled Enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com,

[2:24:05.120 --> 2:24:15.520]  You know, they're proposing having military all over the streets of the United States
[2:24:15.520 --> 2:24:19.840]  to deal with terrorist and for domestic uprisings and they're saying, oh, it's a new report out.
[2:24:19.840 --> 2:24:25.040]  We've never prepared for this and we're not safe because of Katrina, which they quote, you know,
[2:24:25.040 --> 2:24:29.840]  stood down on purpose so they could then claim this. As I said they would, we need unlimited power,
[2:24:29.840 --> 2:24:34.640]  not just the trillion for the current defense budget, but another trillion for the domestic
[2:24:34.640 --> 2:24:39.280]  spy force and the rest of it. I mean, it's just unspeakable. I want to go to Janice and Matt and
[2:24:39.280 --> 2:24:44.960]  Joe and a few others here, but finishing up, Shauna, you were talking about slave labor.
[2:24:44.960 --> 2:24:47.760]  I don't know if you're talking about slave wages, but in the case of Halliburton,
[2:24:47.760 --> 2:24:53.280]  it's admitted they actually bring kidnapped people out of Iraq and other countries to other
[2:24:53.280 --> 2:24:59.680]  nations where they run things like brick smelting facilities, metal smelting, and it says they are
[2:24:59.680 --> 2:25:04.160]  prisoners, literally just grabbed up. See, slavery is all still legal folks. They just call it
[2:25:04.160 --> 2:25:08.400]  something else. Just like they catch you smoking marijuana, you become a slave for five years,
[2:25:08.960 --> 2:25:14.880]  you know, and in a prison camp working, building license plates or doing telemarketing. Go ahead
[2:25:14.880 --> 2:25:19.600]  and finish up, though. Okay, you have to hear this because you can't make this shit up. That's
[2:25:19.600 --> 2:25:23.120]  the thing that's crazy. Ma'am, I'm going to let you please watch the language. Oh, I'm so sorry.
[2:25:23.680 --> 2:25:30.560]  I'm just freaking out. What happens is the Indian and Filipino people are recruited by some third
[2:25:30.560 --> 2:25:38.160]  party out of their country for this great job opportunity. They are charged a $5,000 fee,
[2:25:39.120 --> 2:25:43.520]  okay, in order to, you know, process it and whatever and get the job basically as a bribe.
[2:25:44.160 --> 2:25:47.760]  Yeah, that's like the women in Russia. They say you're going to be a model and they kidnap them.
[2:25:47.760 --> 2:25:52.240]  Right. And what they do is they bring them over and they, they work from 16 hours a day in the
[2:25:52.240 --> 2:25:57.680]  laundry and the kitchen, you know, cleaning the portapies, whatever they're doing. And it's all
[2:25:57.680 --> 2:26:01.600]  happening right in front of the eyes of every American that's over there. And then meanwhile,
[2:26:01.600 --> 2:26:07.440]  there's hardened Ugandan troops swaggering around with machine guns, and then you're not
[2:26:07.440 --> 2:26:12.320]  allowed to be on. Now, how are they treating you? The Ugandan? Yes. The Ugandan, well,
[2:26:12.320 --> 2:26:17.200]  they treated me like the entertainment. I'm a blonde, blue-eyed woman. So, I mean, I was,
[2:26:17.200 --> 2:26:25.120]  I was exotic to them. They were very, they, they used to, they searched me even though I didn't
[2:26:25.120 --> 2:26:31.360]  profile, which I thought was very odd. They just used it as an opportunity to molest me. But, um,
[2:26:31.360 --> 2:26:38.320]  the, uh, the thing about the, the, uh, the Third Country Nationals, the Filipinos and the Indians
[2:26:38.960 --> 2:26:42.880]  is that they're paid a wage of about $400 a month. But then they're charged rent
[2:26:43.520 --> 2:26:47.360]  and they have to buy their own food. Yeah, sharecropping. And then they can never even afford
[2:26:47.360 --> 2:26:52.320]  to get out of the base or leave. Exactly. And they signed, like, you know, ridiculous
[2:26:52.320 --> 2:26:58.880]  length contracts for 12 years. You know, just, I mean, it's just unbelievable. And then these
[2:26:58.880 --> 2:27:02.560]  people don't have enough money for soap. And what I used to have to do was, because they put them
[2:27:02.560 --> 2:27:07.520]  in their own separate camps. They have an Indian camp. They have a Filipino camp. And, you know,
[2:27:07.520 --> 2:27:13.520]  we'd find, you know, Indians dead in the lake all the time. They'd get murdered. But, uh,
[2:27:14.240 --> 2:27:18.240]  the thing is, is what I would do is I would take all the, the excess soap and toothpaste and stuff
[2:27:18.240 --> 2:27:22.400]  from the care packages that nobody wanted and bring them up to these camps because these, these
[2:27:22.400 --> 2:27:29.520]  slaves are out there with nothing. And I mean, nothing. Working 16 hours a day. Cleaning porta
[2:27:29.520 --> 2:27:35.200]  potty. Well, that's only one level. They take the Iraqi men as slaves to other Third World nations.
[2:27:35.200 --> 2:27:40.640]  And they are physically slaves. No judge, no jury. And anyone who does an uprising,
[2:27:41.680 --> 2:27:44.320]  do you know how many mass graves were uncovered when I was there?
[2:27:44.320 --> 2:27:51.280]  I mean, in, in, I never saw it anywhere on the news. They filtered our access over there. You
[2:27:51.280 --> 2:27:56.240]  know, but, you know, we, you know, I had access to some other stuff, some other news sources
[2:27:56.240 --> 2:28:02.720]  within the military because of my clearance and, and these mass graves, you know, I mean,
[2:28:02.720 --> 2:28:08.160]  thousands of people found, I mean, come on. There's over a million and a half Iraqis
[2:28:08.720 --> 2:28:12.800]  dead since the liberation. Listen, I want you to call back again, but you should write down what
[2:28:12.800 --> 2:28:17.520]  you witnessed and what you saw in an article at prisonplanet.com. Will you promise to do that?
[2:28:17.520 --> 2:28:19.200]  I will. Thanks for the call.
[2:28:19.920 --> 2:28:23.840]  Thank you so much. And call back again. And then I would tell the great folks over at the
[2:28:23.840 --> 2:28:28.560]  prisonplanet.com forum, the great researchers, everything she's saying has independently been
[2:28:28.560 --> 2:28:35.920]  in the news leaked out here, leaked out there under her article post, we're going to create a section
[2:28:35.920 --> 2:28:40.320]  now, all the other articles with the videos of them shooting families for fun and laughing, playing
[2:28:40.320 --> 2:28:46.240]  Elvis music, the mercenaries or running over people's cars with tanks, the troops and laughing as the
[2:28:46.240 --> 2:28:51.200]  family cries and bombing the sheep. You know, put all those videos up, but also put up all
[2:28:51.200 --> 2:28:56.880]  the Chicago Tribune articles about physical slaves, sex slaves, post the articles about the
[2:28:56.880 --> 2:29:01.840]  mercenaries, the Latin American death squads, because that's an important section. And then
[2:29:01.840 --> 2:29:07.120]  we'll put a link to it on the main page of info wars.com or prisonplanet.com in the next few days.
[2:29:07.120 --> 2:29:15.200]  But don't, Sean, don't screw around on that. Get that done. Absolutely. All right, I'll come back
[2:29:15.200 --> 2:29:19.440]  to a few final calls and a few final news stories. I'm going to play part of this on Paul's speech
[2:29:19.440 --> 2:29:24.640]  and then Dr. Jerome Corsi is joining us. We are live, ladies and gentlemen, it is the 25th day of
[2:29:24.640 --> 2:29:30.720]  November 2008. People say, man, how do you handle this so calmly? Well, I don't. That's why I blow
[2:29:30.720 --> 2:29:35.200]  up and scream a lot. It freaks me out. But overall, I mean, I just have to commit to fighting.

[2:30:56.480 --> 2:31:01.760]  what to do, or at least we thought we did. Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film
[2:31:01.760 --> 2:31:10.400]  that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story. Whitman, EPA director on the 18
[2:31:10.400 --> 2:31:17.280]  made a statement that the air was safe to breathe. This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11
[2:31:17.280 --> 2:31:22.480]  truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters. He had his
[2:31:22.480 --> 2:31:26.560]  hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown. He takes his hand off and you hear
[2:31:26.560 --> 2:31:32.720]  three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. This is an emergency transmission

[2:33:16.240 --> 2:33:22.560]  to be a big issue. I mean, unbelievable stuff. You can't even imagine this would go on until
[2:33:22.560 --> 2:33:28.720]  you learn about it. It's so horrible and it is a culture of evil by design with the social
[2:33:28.720 --> 2:33:33.280]  engineers, the behavioral psychologists designing all of this and they're bringing these groups back.
[2:33:33.280 --> 2:33:40.320]  3, 4, 5 tours totally brain dead, totally psychopathic, or they break down and commit
[2:33:40.320 --> 2:33:44.800]  suicide, but some of them like it. They're going to be cops. They're going to use mercenaries in
[2:33:44.800 --> 2:33:50.400]  America, firing trips. There's no end. They're not joking around. They're going to take everything
[2:33:50.400 --> 2:33:54.560]  we've got, they're going to bankrupt the economy, and we've got to fight ahead of us.
[2:33:55.520 --> 2:33:58.560]  And you want to know who runs our government? Look at what they've done in Iraq and Serbia.
[2:33:59.280 --> 2:34:02.480]  Again, I should have talked about it all day long. It's up on prisonplanet.com,
[2:34:03.200 --> 2:34:08.640]  infowars.net, Steve Watson did an article on it today. It's very important. I should talk the
[2:34:08.640 --> 2:34:15.440]  whole show about that, but it's every day now. The Germans attacking NATO UN bases in Kosovo
[2:34:15.440 --> 2:34:19.200]  to blame it on the Serbs, on the Kosovans as an excuse to bring in more control.
[2:34:19.840 --> 2:34:26.080]  Oh, we're being bombed. We've got to need more troops. I mean, folks, it's so bankrupt. I hope

[2:35:01.920 --> 2:35:10.160]  800-686-2237. 800-686-2237. I won't be able to keep you on for 30 minutes, Janice. Like I did,
[2:35:10.160 --> 2:35:12.560]  Sean, I had to hear that story, but go ahead. You're on the air.
[2:35:14.000 --> 2:35:22.560]  Hi, Alex. Yeah, I've been researching all about the end game and the RFID,
[2:35:24.560 --> 2:35:29.520]  the conspiracy to implant people with the RFID chip.
[2:35:29.520 --> 2:35:34.240]  It's public, the government, and now Microsoft wants to microchip everybody. Yeah, it's really
[2:35:34.240 --> 2:35:43.760]  happening. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And so what I figured I would try to do as a 13th generation American who
[2:35:44.400 --> 2:35:51.200]  wants freedom on the streets of America is I figured that what I would try to do is I would try to
[2:35:51.200 --> 2:36:00.320]  fight the mandatory helmet law in North Carolina on an unconstitutional basis. And you wouldn't
[2:36:00.320 --> 2:36:07.760]  believe how difficult it is to just try to overturn... Well, it was beaten in Texas. And I'm not
[2:36:07.760 --> 2:36:12.400]  saying it's... I mean, people do deserve freedom, and I understand why people fought it and beat it.
[2:36:12.400 --> 2:36:16.640]  I just think there's things a lot more hardcore than that. But I understand the nanny state. I mean,
[2:36:16.640 --> 2:36:19.920]  once you agree, they can make you wear a helmet. Well, then, oh, we'll put a camera in your car
[2:36:19.920 --> 2:36:22.880]  to make sure you're behaving yourself. We're in your home. They're now proposing that,
[2:36:22.880 --> 2:36:28.000]  so there is no end. And standing up itself is victory. Resistance is victory, so I salute you.
[2:36:28.640 --> 2:36:37.440]  Exactly. So, I mean, it's taking me two years of solid work just to try to get the government to
[2:36:37.440 --> 2:36:45.840]  recognize that they should not be attaching a device to people's heads without their permission.
[2:36:45.840 --> 2:36:50.720]  I mean, that's what it's coming down to. And the same thing is going to happen with
[2:36:50.720 --> 2:36:55.280]  the implant of the RFID. Yeah, they're going to say it's for your safety so we know where you are
[2:36:55.280 --> 2:36:59.920]  when you're hurt. They're already trying to make it with old people or prisoners. I got to jump,
[2:36:59.920 --> 2:37:03.360]  but it's a great point you make, because I want to air as much of this Ron Paul as we can. Well,
[2:37:03.360 --> 2:37:09.120]  there are Ron Paul till the eight after. Most of the speech, the rest of it's up on infoawards.com,
[2:37:09.120 --> 2:37:14.080]  a prisonpunit.com. We want to go watch it from the in the Fed demonstration. It went on 38 cities.
[2:37:14.080 --> 2:37:17.680]  I was in Dallas with the great folks there. Ron Paul was in Houston, and I was there in
[2:37:17.680 --> 2:37:22.880]  Dallas with Ron Paul's younger brother, Wayne Paul, so that was wonderful. And it was great
[2:37:22.880 --> 2:37:26.400]  seeing all of you up there and just wonderful seeing you stand up against evil. And everybody
[2:37:27.040 --> 2:37:31.120]  out there, I mean, the evil's growing, folks. That's what happens historically. You don't stand up
[2:37:31.120 --> 2:37:35.280]  and fight it. You rationalize. You say the government's good. Everything's fine. Let the
[2:37:35.280 --> 2:37:40.000]  government grow. Give up our liberties. You end up absolute slaves. We have all this liberty
[2:37:40.000 --> 2:37:44.400]  and all this wealth because we had forefathers that wouldn't lay down and be slaves. That mean
[2:37:44.400 --> 2:37:50.080]  they were perfect. But the point is, it was better than the other nation. We're losing all our basic
[2:37:50.080 --> 2:37:55.200]  freedoms. And the people running things are just completely psychopathic. Here is Ron Paul in Houston
[2:37:55.200 --> 2:38:00.560]  on Saturday, and then Dr. Corsi is coming up. Please stay with us. We'll be back after the
[2:38:00.560 --> 2:38:07.840]  Ron Paul. But it is a great event. I understand that there are a lot of events like this throughout
[2:38:07.840 --> 2:38:14.880]  the country. And this should be very significant. We won't be on the evening news tonight. I'm quite
[2:38:14.880 --> 2:38:21.840]  sure of that around the country. But we are on the evening news every single night, every single
[2:38:21.840 --> 2:38:27.680]  day. And we're on the minds of the people every single day because there is a crisis in this
[2:38:27.680 --> 2:38:34.720]  country. One of, if not worse than the crisis of the depression of 30s, and that's on endlessly.
[2:38:34.720 --> 2:38:39.520]  And we know who caused it. It was the Federal Reserve that gave us all this trouble.
[2:38:46.080 --> 2:38:51.200]  Concern and interest about monetary policy comes and goes. When things are in the boom
[2:38:51.200 --> 2:38:55.440]  phase of a cycle, everybody loves it. And they ignore it and they don't care because they're
[2:38:55.440 --> 2:39:02.240]  getting a free ride. And we've had an especially free, good free ride for decades now because
[2:39:02.240 --> 2:39:06.960]  we've had a system that was devised where the dollar could act as if it were gold. This is
[2:39:06.960 --> 2:39:14.480]  because Kurt, since 1971, absolutely beneficial to us because we were printing the world gold
[2:39:14.480 --> 2:39:19.200]  in essence. So they were willing to take our dollars. We knew they were building this huge
[2:39:19.200 --> 2:39:26.720]  financial bubble and we knew it would come to an end. So now the economic crisis is the top
[2:39:26.720 --> 2:39:33.440]  agenda in a whole country. But our job is to make sure that people come to the full
[2:39:34.080 --> 2:39:40.320]  realization and understanding of the relationship of who controls the money and why we have the
[2:39:40.320 --> 2:39:45.760]  economic crisis. And that is what the job is of campaigns and organizations and rallies like
[2:39:45.760 --> 2:39:57.840]  this. So I compliment you for coming and joining in and understanding this issue.
[2:39:59.440 --> 2:40:05.280]  When the Brentwoods Agreement broke down on August 15, 1971, which was a Sunday,
[2:40:06.160 --> 2:40:12.800]  it brought about loud cheers in the marketplace. Stock market store mixed and closed the gold
[2:40:12.800 --> 2:40:19.360]  window, put on wage and price controls, and he raised taxes. The business community loved it
[2:40:20.160 --> 2:40:25.280]  until a few days later they realized it was a disaster and 1970s turned out to be terrible,
[2:40:25.280 --> 2:40:32.880]  inflation and recession. But it brought about a new economic system. And since that time,
[2:40:32.880 --> 2:40:39.600]  we have been able to spend beyond our means, live beyond our means, print money beyond our means,
[2:40:39.600 --> 2:40:47.600]  and all live much better than we really had earned. So we were living beyond our means. So
[2:40:47.600 --> 2:40:52.880]  the country benefited and we had on the surface had an appearance of great wealth.
[2:40:54.320 --> 2:40:59.440]  But it was doomed to fail. And that is what the announcement has been in this past year,
[2:40:59.440 --> 2:41:07.440]  is the failure of the dollar reserve standard that was set up in August of 1971. It has ended.
[2:41:07.440 --> 2:41:13.520]  The only question that is to be answered right now is, what is it going to be replaced with?
[2:41:13.520 --> 2:41:21.120]  And believe me, they're working very hard to devise a new system. And they're talking about
[2:41:21.120 --> 2:41:30.000]  an international fiat currency paper system with the loss of US sovereignty in total and total.
[2:41:30.000 --> 2:41:35.680]  And our goal has to be not only to restore the integrity of our money and our dollar and our
[2:41:35.680 --> 2:41:42.880]  constitution, we have to stop this move toward one world government and a one world currency.
[2:41:52.080 --> 2:41:58.160]  Periodically, the money issue soars to the forefront. It's there right now today. But there's a lot
[2:41:58.160 --> 2:42:02.720]  of work and a lot of danger because if we don't win, we lose our liberties and we further lose
[2:42:02.720 --> 2:42:07.440]  our constitution. But at the time of the Constitutional Convention, this was one of the key issues
[2:42:07.440 --> 2:42:12.800]  with the monetary issue. They had gone through runaway inflation with the continental dollar.
[2:42:12.800 --> 2:42:18.400]  So that is why the founders knew and understood that they had to put prohibitions in the Constitution.
[2:42:18.400 --> 2:42:25.600]  They said no emitting of bills and credit, no paper money, only gold and silver is legal tender
[2:42:25.600 --> 2:42:33.600]  and no authority for a central bank. And of course, this hard money people won that argument.
[2:42:33.600 --> 2:42:39.200]  The Constitution was written in such a way that we knew that gold and silver were to be legal tender
[2:42:39.200 --> 2:42:44.640]  and no central bank. But immediately after that, the Federalists changed it all, established a
[2:42:44.640 --> 2:42:49.280]  national bank. The big argument between the Jeffersonians and the Hamiltonians started
[2:42:49.280 --> 2:42:55.920]  right off the bat because historically throughout all history, there's always been a fight over
[2:42:55.920 --> 2:43:02.160]  who can control the money. So what we're facing today is not brand new. It is the power of government
[2:43:02.160 --> 2:43:08.080]  that wants to control the money because they can control the people. The freer the country,
[2:43:08.080 --> 2:43:14.400]  the more likely it is that you will have a high sound currency with no national control of the
[2:43:14.400 --> 2:43:20.080]  currency whatsoever. But that didn't last long. Of course, we do know that when Jefferson had
[2:43:20.080 --> 2:43:25.520]  the chance to deal with the first national bank, what did Jefferson do? He got rid of the national
[2:43:25.520 --> 2:43:35.200]  bank. Only for the second national bank to be established, then along came another hard money
[2:43:35.200 --> 2:43:41.040]  man who said that he didn't like the bankers and he didn't like government power designed and worked
[2:43:41.040 --> 2:43:45.600]  around the monetary issue. So who came along to get rid of the second national bank? That was
[2:43:45.600 --> 2:43:53.040]  Andrew Jackson. And he got rid of it. But lo and behold, in 1913, the American people
[2:43:53.040 --> 2:43:58.800]  complacent and the Congress complacent in it went along and said, oh, no, we have to have
[2:44:00.880 --> 2:44:06.160]  a national bank once again. So the Federal Reserve system was set up. And so we've been
[2:44:06.160 --> 2:44:11.920]  struggling. We've been struggling since 1913. There was a linkage to gold up until 1971.
[2:44:11.920 --> 2:44:18.560]  But the erosion continued. And now we're seeing the erosion of our prosperity that we have now
[2:44:18.560 --> 2:44:25.280]  seeing, which is our to our benefit. It is written on the wall. It is the end of this system that
[2:44:25.280 --> 2:44:32.000]  we have today. They cannot patch it up. They can't put it back together again. They know it. And we
[2:44:32.000 --> 2:44:36.640]  know it. The only argument is what is it going to be replaced with? The other day, Bernanke was
[2:44:36.640 --> 2:44:45.920]  before the banking committee. And I asked him explicitly, because he had just been in Europe,
[2:44:45.920 --> 2:44:51.040]  whether he had talked to the other central bankers and they any plan whatsoever for an international
[2:44:52.560 --> 2:44:58.000]  reserve currency, he said no. But you know, he's on the side of the law, not on the side of the
[2:44:58.000 --> 2:45:05.600]  Constitution. But the law is written that he has no obligation to tell us anything of what he does.
[2:45:05.600 --> 2:45:13.040]  Monetary policy, any kind of conversations with other central bankers, the law explicitly says
[2:45:13.040 --> 2:45:18.080]  he does not have to reveal anything that he does. So I pressed him a little bit further. I said,
[2:45:18.080 --> 2:45:26.000]  does the subject of gold ever come up? And he said no. And then he quickly corrected himself
[2:45:26.000 --> 2:45:32.080]  because he wouldn't, because he really wanted to destroy the idea, the concept that we might someday
[2:45:32.080 --> 2:45:38.320]  move in the direction of having a commodity standard. So he quickly said, oh yeah, it comes up
[2:45:38.320 --> 2:45:45.920]  when we talk about selling gold. But what he's saying there is very, very important. He admitted
[2:45:45.920 --> 2:45:51.600]  that the central banks do get together. They do talk and they do dump gold for a very precise
[2:45:51.600 --> 2:45:58.800]  reason. They do that to pretend that the dollar is still more valuable than it really is. In the
[2:45:58.800 --> 2:46:06.480]  1960s, up until 71, Nixon and Republican and Democrats alike, because the law said the dollar
[2:46:06.480 --> 2:46:13.360]  after Bretton Woods established in 44, the dollar was as good as gold at $35 an ounce. So the foreigners
[2:46:13.360 --> 2:46:18.080]  started coming in. They knew we had printed all this money and they got sending the dollars back.
[2:46:18.080 --> 2:46:26.720]  And we had given away the 500 ounces of gold at $35 an ounce. So we were running out of gold
[2:46:26.720 --> 2:46:32.000]  because we had abused the system. And that's why they had to come to an end. But in a way,
[2:46:32.000 --> 2:46:37.440]  they were giving away this gold at this artificially low price to try to prove the dollar was really
[2:46:37.440 --> 2:46:42.160]  strong. Well, that broke down and the dollar was devalued and we had all the inflation that came.
[2:46:42.160 --> 2:46:47.360]  But they've done this now in the last 10 or 15 years. I'm convinced because they do admit it.
[2:46:47.360 --> 2:46:52.480]  Central banks in the West especially have been dumping gold to artificially lower the price
[2:46:52.480 --> 2:46:57.520]  of gold in order to artificially pretend the dollar is of great value. And they're still doing it.
[2:46:57.520 --> 2:47:02.960]  But they're running out of time and they're running out of gold because the gold is getting
[2:47:02.960 --> 2:47:08.480]  into the hands of the economic powers who are stronger. And those are the ones who have been
[2:47:08.480 --> 2:47:14.240]  working hard, saving money, loaning the money back up and are ready to buy up America if we
[2:47:14.240 --> 2:47:20.320]  continue to do this. So the Asian banks are buying the gold. The Europeans and the Americans and
[2:47:20.320 --> 2:47:25.760]  others are dumping gold. So the other nations, including Muslim nations, even before the bank
[2:47:25.760 --> 2:47:33.520]  committee, I did point out to Bernanke that the Iranians have just bought $75 billion worth of
[2:47:33.520 --> 2:47:40.240]  gold and put it in reserves. So it is a contest. There's no doubt there is a contest between sound
[2:47:40.240 --> 2:47:45.840]  money and hard money. And that is such an important issue. To me, the money issue has been key. In
[2:47:45.840 --> 2:47:53.360]  1971, I first did politics and ran for office in the 1970s. The general issue, of course,
[2:47:53.360 --> 2:47:57.600]  was personal liberty and national sovereignty in our Constitution. But the specific issue was
[2:47:57.600 --> 2:48:03.360]  monetary policy, what they were doing to the money. Because those who love big government,
[2:48:03.360 --> 2:48:11.040]  they love and must control the money. Because if governments were ever required to pay the bills
[2:48:11.040 --> 2:48:18.720]  as they spent the money, the people would rise up and object. So it is the most deceitful tax
[2:48:18.720 --> 2:48:26.880]  that you can have. The income tax is horrible. But the tax on the tax through inflation is even
[2:48:26.880 --> 2:48:34.160]  more deceptive. But politicians and proponents of big government loved inflation because they
[2:48:34.160 --> 2:48:39.760]  have more control. They can delay the payment. They can hide the victims until finally the
[2:48:39.760 --> 2:48:47.840]  whole thing falls apart. And who does it serve? Who would want this? Well, people who like war.
[2:48:47.840 --> 2:48:52.800]  People who want to pay for war. If we had to pay every single day for all the money we spend
[2:48:52.800 --> 2:48:58.000]  on the wars that don't need to be fought, we would end it. So I would say if you're anti-war
[2:48:58.000 --> 2:49:02.800]  and pro-liberty, we have to get rid of the feds so they quit fighting these wars.
[2:49:12.800 --> 2:49:18.320]  And likewise, others like the monetary system where you inflate the currency when you can't
[2:49:18.320 --> 2:49:23.760]  tax anymore, you can't borrow anymore. What they do, of course, is print the money. So they love
[2:49:23.760 --> 2:49:29.840]  welfare. Everybody loves welfare. Who wants the welfare? So there's all these special interests
[2:49:29.840 --> 2:49:36.080]  in the politicians just to accommodate. And they don't have to be responsible and balance the budget
[2:49:36.080 --> 2:49:43.280]  at all. But eventually, though, of course, it causes all these great problems. But there's
[2:49:43.280 --> 2:49:51.120]  quite a few good reasons why we should oppose a monetary system like this. One, it's very clearly
[2:49:51.120 --> 2:49:56.800]  written in our Constitution. So if we believe in the rule of law, that should be enough. So if we
[2:49:56.800 --> 2:50:02.000]  had more men and women of integrity in our government that would just stand up and take their oath
[2:50:02.000 --> 2:50:14.720]  of office seriously, this whole mess would be ended. It wouldn't even happen. For moral reasons,
[2:50:14.720 --> 2:50:20.160]  and that's a pretty good reason, you know, there are even strong admonitions in the Bible about
[2:50:20.160 --> 2:50:25.760]  honesty and ways and measures that you're not supposed to cheat your fellow man by dishonest
[2:50:25.760 --> 2:50:32.320]  ways. And that's what the inflationary system is. In the old days, they clipped the coins or
[2:50:32.320 --> 2:50:38.480]  diluted the metals. Today, we just allow governments to print the money or create it in a computer.
[2:50:39.040 --> 2:50:45.360]  That is immoral. That is immoral and it's equivalent to counterfeit. If you or I counterfeit,
[2:50:45.360 --> 2:50:51.440]  we rightfully are taken to jail and prosecuted for it. With Christmas right around the corner

[2:51:55.040 --> 2:52:01.440]  against this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy? Bin Laden.
[2:52:01.440 --> 2:52:06.080]  This is his MO. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden. Fabled
[2:52:06.080 --> 2:52:10.560]  Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[2:52:10.560 --> 2:52:15.360]  networks inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis
[2:52:15.360 --> 2:52:22.720]  again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been
[2:52:22.720 --> 2:52:28.240]  detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian
[2:52:28.240 --> 2:52:32.480]  connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government,
[2:52:32.480 --> 2:52:39.120]  and much, much more. Fabled enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com. Forsee it in super high quality,

[2:54:18.560 --> 2:54:23.520]  Really is destructive to our personal liberties. If we allow big government to grow in this
[2:54:23.520 --> 2:54:30.320]  sinister way, then real threat, there's economic threats and there's war threats and there's all
[2:54:30.320 --> 2:54:37.840]  these problems. But the real threat is that the more power those individuals have to create money
[2:54:37.840 --> 2:54:42.880]  out of thin air and create big government. Big government is the office of individual liberty.
[2:54:42.880 --> 2:54:47.520]  So, the bigger the government gets, the more control they have on money, the less freedom we
[2:54:47.520 --> 2:54:52.640]  have and just look at what's happened, even in the last 10 or 15 years, what has been happening.
[2:54:52.640 --> 2:54:57.600]  Our personal liberties, our personal promises are being diminished. The right of habeas corpus
[2:54:57.600 --> 2:55:04.000]  has been undermined. The whole idea of the patriarch, these bills and laws should be repealed, not
[2:55:04.000 --> 2:55:17.600]  enhanced. But right now we're facing the economic consequences and this will get the attention
[2:55:17.600 --> 2:55:24.480]  of the people and like I said, the real task is relating the problems we have today to the powers
[2:55:25.360 --> 2:55:31.360]  of the Federal Reserve System and why we have to have the proper changes. When governments inflate
[2:55:31.360 --> 2:55:36.480]  a currency, there's always a boom. People do benefit, people do feel better and sometimes the
[2:55:36.480 --> 2:55:43.440]  boom can last longer than other times. The longer it lasts, the bigger the bust. And since 1971,
[2:55:43.440 --> 2:55:49.600]  we've had some various recessions and some have been more serious than others, but not tremendously
[2:55:49.600 --> 2:55:54.960]  so because they quickly came back in, inflated a currency, spent the money, run up the deficits,
[2:55:54.960 --> 2:55:59.440]  keep the wars going on and on the surface, it looked like it was doing pretty well.
[2:55:59.440 --> 2:56:04.960]  At the same time, the bubble was getting bigger and bigger and bigger and we were becoming more
[2:56:04.960 --> 2:56:12.800]  dependent on borrowing from overseas. And now we got to the point where that has all come to an end.
[2:56:12.800 --> 2:56:20.320]  This system is on its last legs. We will not go back to the old bubble in the stock market,
[2:56:20.320 --> 2:56:26.800]  the old bubble in the housing market. That has all ended and now we have to do something about it.
[2:56:26.800 --> 2:56:33.760]  So what are they doing in Washington? Everything they're doing so far is absolutely opposite
[2:56:33.760 --> 2:56:44.960]  of what they should be doing. Right now the attitude in Washington is everybody gets the
[2:56:44.960 --> 2:56:51.120]  bailout and then pretend that they're being cautious about it. But right now, we in the
[2:56:51.120 --> 2:56:58.240]  Congress and the people don't even know how much is being spent. You've heard about the lawsuit
[2:56:58.240 --> 2:57:06.480]  by Bloomberg. They have filed a lawsuit against the Federal Reserve under the Freedom of Information
[2:57:06.480 --> 2:57:13.120]  Act saying, look, we understand you've created $2 trillion and we want to know who got the money
[2:57:13.120 --> 2:57:17.680]  and who got the benefits. But they're not going to get the information because, like I said,
[2:57:17.680 --> 2:57:22.880]  the Federal Reserve is protected. They don't have to give that information. $2 trillion,
[2:57:22.880 --> 2:57:27.120]  and even I on the banking committee on domestic monetary policy subcommittee,
[2:57:27.120 --> 2:57:32.880]  I have no access to this information. I can't attend the open market committee meetings where
[2:57:32.880 --> 2:57:40.640]  all this policy is designed. And this is the problem that we have. It is so out of control.
[2:57:40.640 --> 2:57:48.400]  So Congress comes along and they appropriate $700 billion. They get the first half of it,
[2:57:48.400 --> 2:57:55.360]  $350, they give it to the Secretary of the Treasury. He starts buying up worthless assets.
[2:57:58.080 --> 2:58:02.960]  Then he wonders why nobody wants it. Nobody wants them other than the taxpayers getting
[2:58:02.960 --> 2:58:08.400]  stuck with them because they are worthless. So we take more money. We inflate the currency
[2:58:08.400 --> 2:58:14.800]  to buy up worthless assets that are worthless because of the monetary system. So all the things
[2:58:14.800 --> 2:58:19.600]  that we're doing were the cause of the problem. We spend too much. We inflate too much. We have
[2:58:19.600 --> 2:58:25.680]  too much debt. And now what are we doing to try to bail everybody out? We spend more. We inflate
[2:58:25.680 --> 2:58:32.880]  more and we borrow more and it goes on. He goes on endlessly. Thank you for listening to GCN.

[2:59:43.280 --> 3:00:00.720]  I already... Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones
[3:00:00.720 --> 3:00:08.560]  on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. So the confidence
[3:00:08.560 --> 3:00:15.200]  will finally be lost and we will be threatened because there are some who believe and I am
[3:00:15.200 --> 3:00:21.680]  greatly concerned that when the problems get bad, see, I don't think the problems are that bad,
[3:00:21.680 --> 3:00:26.800]  one thing it leads to is there's going to be a certain group of people that won't agree with
[3:00:26.800 --> 3:00:32.080]  you. You might agree that you have responsibility for yourselves and assume it. What you'd like to
[3:00:32.080 --> 3:00:36.800]  do is get the government out of the way, let you keep what you earn and let the government just
[3:00:36.800 --> 3:00:41.040]  forget about taxing and get rid of the income tax and all their owner's regulation.
[3:00:47.920 --> 3:00:53.200]  But there are a lot out there still and we just wonder where the numbers come down and
[3:00:54.480 --> 3:01:00.560]  believe that we owe them a living. The people who have something owe that something else to those
[3:01:00.560 --> 3:01:05.920]  who don't have something or don't work or can't work or whatever and that the government's role
[3:01:05.920 --> 3:01:14.240]  is to redistribute the wealth. Well, that worked too for a while because there was a lot of wealth
[3:01:14.240 --> 3:01:19.600]  or at least it looked like we had a lot of wealth. But now, can you think of how many
[3:01:19.600 --> 3:01:25.680]  trillions and trillions of dollars of this paper wealth has been wiped off the books in the last
[3:01:25.680 --> 3:01:32.800]  six months? Everybody is probably, it's been involved, they've wiped, they've lost wealth.
[3:01:32.800 --> 3:01:38.320]  So now, does that mean will they automatically look to us for the answers, not likely? Because
[3:01:38.320 --> 3:01:44.560]  they're going to do what they've been doing, saying, you owe it to us, we deserve it, we have a right
[3:01:44.560 --> 3:01:50.240]  to it. And their idea of rights are a lot different than ours. We believe, of course, that we have a
[3:01:50.240 --> 3:01:56.240]  right to our life, we have a right to our liberty and we have a right to keep that which we earn.
[3:01:56.240 --> 3:02:08.400]  Others believe they have a right to your wealth, they have a right to a job, they have a right to
[3:02:08.400 --> 3:02:14.160]  free medical care, and they have a right to education. Those aren't rights, those are demands.
[3:02:14.160 --> 3:02:23.920]  So as this evolves and the country keeps getting poorer and the demands grow, I can foresee a
[3:02:23.920 --> 3:02:29.440]  time where people aren't going to be satisfied and we would end up with some violence. This should
[3:02:29.440 --> 3:02:36.400]  be our goal is to avoid that. It is only through understanding that avoid that, it is only through
[3:02:36.400 --> 3:02:44.640]  understanding that we can avoid that and correct our problems. Before the 1930s, we had recessions
[3:02:44.640 --> 3:02:48.880]  because there was a lot of abuse. Even when we had gold, there was abuse of the gold standard,
[3:02:48.880 --> 3:02:55.600]  so we would have inflations and recessions and depressions, but the one rule was the government
[3:02:55.600 --> 3:03:02.320]  was to keep their hands out of the recovery phase. The last depression that we had before
[3:03:02.320 --> 3:03:08.160]  the Great Depression was 1921. It was one year, it hardly even makes the history books, but it was
[3:03:08.160 --> 3:03:14.640]  real sharp, very severe. It was a consequence of the inflation of 1917-1918 for World War I,
[3:03:14.640 --> 3:03:23.120]  but they kept their hands off. But as soon as the crash of 29, it hit Hoover and Roosevelt,
[3:03:23.120 --> 3:03:27.840]  just said, well, we have to do something, do something. So the mentality had changed and
[3:03:27.840 --> 3:03:34.800]  that is what gave the prolongation of the depression. So today, we're right there where we
[3:03:34.800 --> 3:03:41.360]  are again. Unfortunately, so far, we're making the same very bad mistakes that we made in the 1930s
[3:03:41.360 --> 3:03:48.880]  and this is going to be prolonged and very serious. Unless, unless we win the intellectual argument
[3:03:48.880 --> 3:03:55.840]  that we're talking about here today, individual liberty, morality and money, the constitution,
[3:03:56.800 --> 3:04:04.080]  responsibility for ourselves, what freedom really means. If we win that and we could eliminate all
[3:04:04.080 --> 3:04:12.080]  this pressure to perpetuate a deeply flawed system, if we win, this could be over in a year. The big
[3:04:12.080 --> 3:04:18.320]  problem is, is can you imagine how the people respond generally who want more stuff to say,
[3:04:18.320 --> 3:04:23.280]  oh, what is the answer to the recession and the problem we have today? For the government to do
[3:04:23.280 --> 3:04:35.680]  nothing, just get out of the way is what we need to do. Of course, doing nothing has a very positive
[3:04:35.680 --> 3:04:40.800]  spin to it. Doing nothing means we're not going to tax you and we're not going to regulate you.
[3:04:40.800 --> 3:04:44.800]  We're not going to tell you what to do with your life and we're not going to tell you.

[3:05:49.920 --> 3:05:55.440]  a terrorist act of war against this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th,
[3:05:56.000 --> 3:06:00.720]  but who is the enemy? Bin Laden. This is his MO. We have to look to the Middle East,
[3:06:00.720 --> 3:06:05.920]  we have to look to Osama Bin Laden. Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at
[3:06:05.920 --> 3:06:11.040]  the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators
[3:06:11.040 --> 3:06:16.080]  believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[3:06:16.640 --> 3:06:22.320]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA,
[3:06:22.320 --> 3:06:27.360]  the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[3:06:27.360 --> 3:06:32.640]  warnings and war games, the shadow government and much, much more. Fabled Enemies. Get the DVD

[3:08:05.760 --> 3:08:11.920]  the bailout is a private looting or a heist. The documents that cover all that former head of the
[3:08:11.920 --> 3:08:17.520]  Treasury had a policy. Dr. Roberts, former editor of the Wall Street Journal, talked about how it
[3:08:17.520 --> 3:08:23.440]  was a heist on Friday. But none of that matters now. The police state, none of it matters because
[3:08:23.440 --> 3:08:30.000]  Obama's in there and the whole agenda, the new voters continuing on. And I've never seen any
[3:08:30.000 --> 3:08:35.280]  American leader worship like this. The last person in the Western world I saw being called
[3:08:35.280 --> 3:08:41.680]  the one, the one to change the world, the leader. But by major publications was Adolf Hitler.
[3:08:43.280 --> 3:08:49.200]  Adolf Hitler was talked about in Europe and the US like this. Like he was some type of rock star.
[3:08:50.640 --> 3:08:54.560]  A lot of Americans don't know that. You've only heard the bad stuff about Hitler. But before the
[3:08:54.560 --> 3:09:03.760]  war, in the 1940, 39, when he went into Czechoslovakia and then into the Rhineland, Sudetenland,
[3:09:03.760 --> 3:09:09.680]  Danzig, places like that, he was the savior. He was the guy. He had all the answers. He had
[3:09:09.680 --> 3:09:16.000]  the Olympics in 36. He drew the designs for the Olympics, the torch, the rings. He was the one.
[3:09:17.200 --> 3:09:22.240]  Anytime you see that historically, that lets you know the system is planning some bad stuff with
[3:09:22.240 --> 3:09:28.320]  this person. They're going to bring in the police state, North American Union, carbon taxes, everything
[3:09:28.320 --> 3:09:33.360]  under him and police, military, FBI, all of you have a choice to make. Are you with the American
[3:09:33.360 --> 3:09:37.360]  people in liberty or with a new world order? A lot of you, through fear, are going to go along with
[3:09:37.360 --> 3:09:44.720]  this. In the end of this, when we fall like Germany or however it's going to happen, just remember
[3:09:44.720 --> 3:09:49.600]  you were warned, and we could have said no to this. Dr. Corsi, of course, wrote the book that
[3:09:49.600 --> 3:09:54.560]  helped defeat Kerry. And then he was no big fan of McCain. He wrote the book, Abomination,
[3:09:54.560 --> 3:09:58.560]  and I found it to be very accurate. They didn't attack him on that. They attacked him on interviews,
[3:09:58.560 --> 3:10:03.200]  he'd done, or things he'd said, or were coming on this radio show and saying, you know, that we
[3:10:03.200 --> 3:10:10.560]  needed to look at the collapse of the towers. He said, just look at it. So that became a big
[3:10:10.560 --> 3:10:16.320]  international issue this show. And we interviewed him out in Denver, but not since then. And so,
[3:10:16.320 --> 3:10:22.160]  of course, he's an expert on the NAU, on the carbon tax, on all of this and together with
[3:10:22.160 --> 3:10:26.000]  Barack Obama. So I wanted to get him on today to talk about what's happened during the campaign,
[3:10:26.000 --> 3:10:32.320]  what happened in Kenya. He's been pretty sick. He's got real ill in Kenya. He's still ill right
[3:10:32.320 --> 3:10:36.640]  now. I'm not going to spend too much time on that, but he's just now able to do interviews a lot
[3:10:36.640 --> 3:10:41.200]  again. Dr. Corsi, good to have you on with us. Oh, thanks, Alex. Great to be back with you.
[3:10:42.080 --> 3:10:49.760]  Yeah, I've had arthritis in my spine and a really kind of chronic arthritis. It just flared up in
[3:10:49.760 --> 3:10:55.920]  Kenya. I could barely walk. Then I went to Hawaii, did more research. I mean, I've been really
[3:10:55.920 --> 3:11:01.280]  struggling for the last month, but still researching and getting the stories out. So I'll be
[3:11:02.160 --> 3:11:07.280]  hopefully able to get the meds in me and take some rest now with the elections over, except the
[3:11:07.280 --> 3:11:14.080]  stories continue. At least I don't think there's going to be much rest for a while.
[3:11:14.080 --> 3:11:21.280]  Well, let's talk about briefly your experience in the campaign, the way the media handled it,
[3:11:21.840 --> 3:11:26.000]  the way they gave kid gloves for him, but then what even makes stuff. I'm not that I'm defending
[3:11:26.000 --> 3:11:30.160]  it, but make stuff up about Pailin and others. And then let's talk about now where we're going
[3:11:30.160 --> 3:11:36.560]  in the future. We exposed last week that on his website, last Thursday, change.gov, that he said
[3:11:36.560 --> 3:11:42.480]  compulsory national service for old people, young people, little kids, and they took that down over
[3:11:42.480 --> 3:11:49.600]  the weekend. And now big Neo, big Neo Lib websites are saying we're liars. That was never on his
[3:11:49.600 --> 3:11:55.680]  site. So Colt like devotion and denial. Well, I think, you know, certainly when I suffered,
[3:11:55.680 --> 3:12:03.840]  when I went through, if you criticized Obama, you're informed, you know, severe attacks from
[3:12:03.840 --> 3:12:11.840]  the Obama campaign. The Obama is not open to the type of normal criticism. The most
[3:12:11.840 --> 3:12:17.360]  political candidates expect, I mean, look at Sarah Pailin and the attacks as they went,
[3:12:17.360 --> 3:12:22.560]  all the attacks on Sarah Pailin are Joe the plumber. I mean, you know, being for writing a
[3:12:22.560 --> 3:12:29.200]  book, they wrote a 40 page unfit for publication. You know, saying my book was full of lies and
[3:12:29.200 --> 3:12:35.360]  inaccuracies. Actually, they were very, very minor issues. You know, easily corrected the
[3:12:35.360 --> 3:12:40.160]  second printing in my book. And then they use data mining with the government to pull up everything
[3:12:40.160 --> 3:12:44.560]  on Joe the plumber and then twist that. But that's okay. That's loving and sweet. And they also,
[3:12:44.560 --> 3:12:52.160]  you know, they did, I wrote a 60 page rebuttal rejoinder to all the, you know, this unfit
[3:12:52.160 --> 3:12:58.480]  for publication that I publish in world that daily. And of course, the Obama campaign totally
[3:12:58.480 --> 3:13:08.000]  ignored by responses. So it's entirely one way attack. And the Obama campaign seems to be totally,
[3:13:08.000 --> 3:13:15.840]  you know, totally unable to take criticism. It's going to be, if they continue this way,
[3:13:15.840 --> 3:13:22.640]  it's going to be worse than Nixon's enemies or, you know, the inability of a campaign or
[3:13:22.640 --> 3:13:30.160]  presidency to engage in what's normal of give and take of policy criticism.
[3:13:30.160 --> 3:13:36.880]  Well, that's like Rahm Emanuel, when he was Clinton's head guy in 96, screaming, die, die,
[3:13:36.880 --> 3:13:42.240]  as he said, the names stabbing the table at a dinner they were having foaming at the mouth.
[3:13:43.120 --> 3:13:46.320]  They're now saying Chuck E. Schumer and all of them are saying yes, they're coming after
[3:13:46.320 --> 3:13:51.440]  talk radio, everybody's free speech. And all these mainline liberals who were against George
[3:13:51.440 --> 3:13:57.200]  Bush and his police state, they're suddenly saying yes, yes, ban all the shows, ban them,
[3:13:57.200 --> 3:14:03.440]  get rid of free speech. It's good. Well, I think we're going to have certainly a first around here
[3:14:03.440 --> 3:14:09.440]  where free speech will have to be defended because if the fairness doctrine gets reinstituted
[3:14:09.440 --> 3:14:14.240]  and there's an attempt made, which I think there will be, to shut down talk radio,
[3:14:14.880 --> 3:14:19.760]  you're going to see that the American people again are denied an opportunity to get the truth.
[3:14:20.640 --> 3:14:26.960]  Certainly, I mean, now we've got the Washington Post openly saying that they were biased in favor
[3:14:26.960 --> 3:14:36.800]  of Obama. That was obvious. Certainly, the New York Times, ABC, NBC, MSNBC, they were all biased
[3:14:36.800 --> 3:14:44.000]  in favor of Obama. It was very hard for anybody, for any of us, to get research out there that was
[3:14:44.000 --> 3:14:50.720]  accurate, was well-defined and deserved comment and criticism. Certainly, now we're going to find
[3:14:50.720 --> 3:14:57.120]  that a lot of the stories we developed at the time were true. Reverend Wright, I'm sure, will write
[3:14:57.120 --> 3:15:04.640]  another book. You've got Resko in prison, Resko, I'm sure, to save himself. He's already turning
[3:15:04.640 --> 3:15:10.640]  state's evidence against the governor. I'm sure he'll also turn state's evidence against Obama,
[3:15:11.280 --> 3:15:17.920]  but it's only beginning and Obama's not able to handle the kind of criticism that most
[3:15:17.920 --> 3:15:26.320]  presidents expect as part of the job. Well, we saw that with Clinton that they really had an
[3:15:26.320 --> 3:15:31.520]  enemy's list and really would sick the IRS on people. I mean, I know people personally who
[3:15:31.520 --> 3:15:35.600]  were authors who would mildly criticize them and have the government come after them. We've seen
[3:15:35.600 --> 3:15:41.680]  that same inner group of the Clintonistas come in, but let's talk about Obama's policy because
[3:15:41.680 --> 3:15:47.360]  you're an economic guy. You've got a degree in that, and you've worked with some big firms.
[3:15:47.360 --> 3:15:53.040]  Obama was the big cheerleader when McCain said, hey, maybe we should look at this bailout. He
[3:15:53.040 --> 3:15:57.200]  came out and said, how dare you, McCain? We've got to give him unlimited power, and then the banks
[3:15:57.200 --> 3:16:02.800]  kept the money and said they're going to use it for bonuses and to acquire other healthy
[3:16:02.800 --> 3:16:08.880]  institutions. I mean, that's now even in the New York Times. We've got Obama for an NAU. We've got
[3:16:08.880 --> 3:16:14.880]  him now saying he's four more trade deals. We've got him openly saying youth brigades and
[3:16:15.440 --> 3:16:22.320]  million-man Stasi forces. I mean, you can't make this type of stuff up. And then there's literally
[3:16:22.320 --> 3:16:26.480]  hundreds of editorial cartoons out in the last week showing him putting the Constitution back
[3:16:26.480 --> 3:16:31.760]  together, taping it, gluing it back together, taking it back from George Bush that he's going
[3:16:31.760 --> 3:16:35.600]  to give us all our liberties back. And meanwhile, he's actually saying, take more.
[3:16:35.600 --> 3:16:40.960]  Well, what I'm saying here, and if you take a look, I'm writing now this red alert.
[3:16:41.760 --> 3:16:49.680]  If you go to redalert.wnd for World Net Daily, redalert.wnd.com. Every week,
[3:16:49.680 --> 3:16:54.880]  I've got an economics newsletter now that I'm publishing. And the current one, you'll see also
[3:16:54.880 --> 3:17:00.720]  the lead story on World Net Daily's front page. I'm saying that the stock market is headed now
[3:17:00.720 --> 3:17:09.520]  to the next low, which is 6,000. I mean, right now, we're trading and as we're talking,
[3:17:09.520 --> 3:17:18.720]  stock market's down about 77 points and it's trading at about 88, 86. On the day of the election,
[3:17:18.720 --> 3:17:26.320]  the stock market was over 9,500. There was enthusiasm at the time that McCain might be
[3:17:26.320 --> 3:17:33.360]  winning and the stock market was doing well. Stock markets dived about 1,000 points since
[3:17:33.360 --> 3:17:38.560]  Obama's been elected. And I'm saying, and people should listen to this very seriously,
[3:17:38.560 --> 3:17:47.600]  I'm saying that the next low in the stock market is 6,000, which means we're standing here to lose
[3:17:48.160 --> 3:17:54.480]  2,800 points on the stock market. It's a huge amount of money out of the economy.
[3:17:54.480 --> 3:18:01.520]  5 trillion out of 401Ks, out of people's ability to really earn a living. I mean,
[3:18:01.520 --> 3:18:07.840]  if the stock market hits 6,000, which I'm saying it will, this is going to be an economic crisis
[3:18:07.840 --> 3:18:13.440]  that will be equivalent to starting to enter the Great Depression. Well, Dr. Corsi, that's my
[3:18:13.440 --> 3:18:20.000]  point. You've got all these Kool-Aid drinkers who literally, I mean, they're on TV saying,
[3:18:20.000 --> 3:18:24.800]  the world has changed. I don't have to work anymore. I'll never have problems again. I mean,
[3:18:24.800 --> 3:18:29.920]  they actually believe this guy's the Messiah. I mean, even if he was a good guy, he couldn't
[3:18:29.920 --> 3:18:35.520]  change or fix any of this. What are they going to do as all he offers is giant million man
[3:18:35.520 --> 3:18:41.360]  domestic spy forces and compulsory drafts for our children? Well, I think first of all, the
[3:18:42.320 --> 3:18:47.440]  key issue with any new president, with any president at all, is they're going to be judged
[3:18:47.440 --> 3:18:54.640]  on results. So Obama can say whatever he wants. People can now cheer lead. They can say these are
[3:18:55.200 --> 3:19:00.720]  brilliant moves. These are, you know, if they love what Obama does, they can say how wonderful it is,
[3:19:01.280 --> 3:19:07.680]  but it's going to get judged on results. And the stock market, which today is now down 79 points,
[3:19:08.240 --> 3:19:13.920]  you know, the stock market heads towards another triple-digit loss. We'll have had,
[3:19:13.920 --> 3:19:20.080]  this will have been the third triple-digit loss since Obama was elected, you know,
[3:19:20.080 --> 3:19:27.920]  but he's now president-elect. Since last Tuesday, all the stock market has done is head itself.
[3:19:27.920 --> 3:19:33.440]  That's reality. You can cheer lead all we want, but the reality is what is going to be judged on.
[3:19:35.600 --> 3:19:39.440]  Dr. Cortsey, stay there. Quick break. We're going to come back and get it any fast that you want
[3:19:39.440 --> 3:19:44.320]  to cover dealing with Obama, but I mean, I got the news here. They're coming after the guns,
[3:19:44.320 --> 3:19:48.080]  everything. I mean, what do we do? How do we stop? Have you ever thought about what's in your
[3:19:48.080 --> 3:19:54.480]  shampoo, soap or detergent? How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfate, sodium, formaldehydes,
[3:19:54.480 --> 3:19:59.360]  and more? Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients,
[3:19:59.360 --> 3:20:03.920]  most of which are synthetic. Hi, this is Alex Jones. I was shocked when I discovered I could

[3:20:46.880 --> 3:20:53.600]  everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job.
[3:20:53.600 --> 3:20:56.400]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[3:20:56.400 --> 3:21:00.720]  I'll do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage. It was engineered by you,
[3:21:00.720 --> 3:21:04.640]  David Rockefeller, the pro-lateral commission to see it for.
[3:21:12.640 --> 3:21:17.520]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[3:21:18.720 --> 3:21:22.160]  An inside job. How dare you?
[3:21:25.360 --> 3:21:28.880]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[3:21:28.880 --> 3:21:31.600]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[3:21:31.600 --> 3:21:36.720]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary

[3:21:48.960 --> 3:21:53.600]  It's practically impossible for police to spot plates that have been treated with a reflective
[3:21:53.600 --> 3:21:56.400]  spray. The reflection blinded our camera.
[3:21:56.400 --> 3:22:00.720]  We are under the microscope. Red light cameras and speed cameras are in place to make money,
[3:22:00.720 --> 3:22:05.360]  not for your safety. But you don't have to be defenseless against these unconstitutional devices.

[3:22:46.320 --> 3:22:48.240]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[3:22:48.240 --> 3:22:53.040]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected
[3:22:53.040 --> 3:22:57.920]  by you, but the symptoms are there. Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes, and drops,
[3:22:57.920 --> 3:23:02.480]  poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that
[3:23:02.480 --> 3:23:07.520]  something is wrong. Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands
[3:23:07.520 --> 3:23:12.560]  of people's lives across America. My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has
[3:23:12.560 --> 3:23:16.800]  totally improved. Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone
[3:23:16.800 --> 3:23:20.240]  how much healthier I feel. I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.

[3:24:10.160 --> 3:24:13.680]  Came out and said, look, he's with the same policies as John McCain. He's for the corporate
[3:24:13.680 --> 3:24:19.600]  looting. He's for more wars. He's for warrantless spying on the American people,
[3:24:21.280 --> 3:24:24.320]  which is just completely widespread. The government's now had to admit that. I mean,
[3:24:24.320 --> 3:24:28.160]  they're totally bankrupt. And then the people just email me going,
[3:24:28.160 --> 3:24:35.760]  ha, ha, you lost. You're just mad. And I've never seen such cult like following or such
[3:24:35.760 --> 3:24:41.440]  mainstream media kneeling before a president. I mean, you heard my Hitler quote earlier,
[3:24:41.440 --> 3:24:48.800]  but I mean, I'm not joking. Dr. Corsi, this is getting worse than I even thought it originally
[3:24:48.800 --> 3:24:54.960]  would be. I think it's going to continue to get worse. Look, Alex, when I was in Kenya,
[3:24:54.960 --> 3:25:01.840]  I went to Kenya. I was there for a week. I was researching. I got called over saying that my
[3:25:01.840 --> 3:25:08.560]  chapter four and the Obama nation is all about how Obama has supported this radical
[3:25:08.560 --> 3:25:15.360]  politician, Odinga, Rila Odinga, who is a communist, basically extreme socialist or a
[3:25:15.360 --> 3:25:20.640]  communist. His father was now a right communist. And Odinga signed an agreement to expand
[3:25:21.200 --> 3:25:28.320]  Sharia law, Islamic law, if the Muslims voted for him in Kenya. Kenya's about 85% Christian right
[3:25:28.320 --> 3:25:35.360]  now. And also when Odinga lost the election in December, we're just talking about December 27th
[3:25:35.920 --> 3:25:42.800]  last year, just a few months ago, Odinga asked for his low tribesmen to go out and protest.
[3:25:43.360 --> 3:25:50.000]  They protested. They killed a thousand of the Kikuyu tribe. They destroyed about 800 churches,
[3:25:50.000 --> 3:25:55.520]  not a single mosque. You know, this little town, Elverette. And it turned out that Senator Obama's
[3:25:55.520 --> 3:26:00.240]  office had advised them to basically do that. Well, in fact, I came back with the document,
[3:26:00.240 --> 3:26:06.800]  which was the plan for Odinga's campaign. And the plan called, and I talked with top
[3:26:07.520 --> 3:26:13.520]  officials of Odinga's campaign with defected, because they were appalled by the violence
[3:26:13.520 --> 3:26:19.840]  after the election and by the agreement Odinga signed with radical Islam. So this is an accurate
[3:26:19.840 --> 3:26:26.240]  document. It called for that if Odinga lost the general election, he was going to use a round
[3:26:26.240 --> 3:26:33.600]  of tribal violence to gain power. And he had Obama working with Odinga on the cell phone
[3:26:34.160 --> 3:26:42.400]  through the entirely through the primary campaign in New Hampshire to advise Odinga as to how to
[3:26:42.400 --> 3:26:49.680]  use all of this power, all of this tribal violence. And that's exactly what Obama's saying now on his
[3:26:49.680 --> 3:26:57.600]  own website. They're saying youth brigades, old folks, compulsory military service, and...
[3:26:57.600 --> 3:27:06.160]  Well, the campaign that Odinga ran was identical to Obama's Odinga ran a campaign on hope and change.
[3:27:06.720 --> 3:27:12.480]  The themes were identical. You know, I brought back the documentary evidence. This is why
[3:27:12.480 --> 3:27:17.840]  I was detained in Kenya. I was there for a week, meeting with the government,
[3:27:17.840 --> 3:27:22.800]  but meeting with top party officials. I decided that they was going to leave. I would hold a press
[3:27:22.800 --> 3:27:29.520]  conference. And then at that press conference, I would reveal those findings, including that Obama
[3:27:29.520 --> 3:27:35.760]  had brought Odinga to the United States three times and raised a million dollars for Odinga in
[3:27:35.760 --> 3:27:43.200]  the United States to run for prime minister in Kenya. Also, Muammar Gaddafi had raised a million
[3:27:43.200 --> 3:27:50.080]  dollars for Obama. I mean, I'm sorry, for Odinga to run for, you know, prime minister for president
[3:27:50.080 --> 3:27:58.400]  then in Kenya. So you had Obama and Gaddafi working hand in hand with Odinga to expand
[3:27:58.400 --> 3:28:05.920]  Islam in Kenya. That's a tremendously important story. And it was not told in the American press.
[3:28:05.920 --> 3:28:09.760]  And you can't make this up that the whole family is basically communist. He's surrounded by
[3:28:09.760 --> 3:28:14.160]  communists and we raise it and they say, so what if everybody's communist and so what if he wants
[3:28:14.160 --> 3:28:21.440]  national compulsory service? That's freedom. And then meanwhile, what are his zombie followers
[3:28:21.440 --> 3:28:26.240]  going to do when the economy keeps falling apart when they don't get the change? Or are they going
[3:28:26.240 --> 3:28:31.520]  to blame people that don't support him? And then if we would have just gotten behind their savior,
[3:28:31.520 --> 3:28:34.960]  that everything would have been all right? Well, certainly they'll do that. But also,
[3:28:34.960 --> 3:28:41.280]  the Obama people will blame the current recession on Bush. This will be Bush's recession.
[3:28:41.280 --> 3:28:46.080]  No matter what, for the next two years, no matter what happens economically, you can bet
[3:28:46.080 --> 3:28:52.080]  that Obama will blame it on Bush. Obama tends to continue to run against Bush throughout his
[3:28:52.080 --> 3:28:59.120]  first term, hoping for a second term. What I'm saying is that the supporters, the Obama supporters
[3:28:59.120 --> 3:29:05.280]  in Kenya, the people that Obama has worked with will like this Odinga. Odinga Odinga, the father,
[3:29:05.280 --> 3:29:11.840]  was an outright communist. He worked with Obama's father. When Obama's father was a failed economist
[3:29:11.840 --> 3:29:19.920]  in the Kenyatta regime, Odinga himself was trained in Eastern Germany and named his first son,
[3:29:19.920 --> 3:29:24.640]  Fidel Castro. So I can show you both Obama's willingness to work with them.
[3:29:24.640 --> 3:29:27.840]  No, it's clear. I mean, Obama is a, hold on,
[3:29:27.840 --> 3:29:31.200]  doctor. We've got to break a long statement coming up. He comes from hardcore political
[3:29:31.200 --> 3:29:34.880]  communists, and that's why the big banks love him because they want to destroy the middle class
[3:29:34.880 --> 3:29:42.560]  and free market. Have a whirl. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN
[3:29:42.560 --> 3:29:51.840]  radio network. Hello, I'm Steve Shane. For the past several months, folks have constantly asked
[3:29:51.840 --> 3:29:57.200]  me to give them the date as to when they should be finished stocking up on food. We've been so beaten
[3:29:57.200 --> 3:30:02.240]  up by stock market banking, housing and unemployment crashes that we're desensitized and frozen and
[3:30:02.240 --> 3:30:07.120]  active like the frog being unknowingly cooked in gradually increasingly hot water. Well,
[3:30:07.120 --> 3:30:12.400]  snap out of it. We now have a deadline. Joe Biden said it's going to happen. Former Secretary of
[3:30:12.400 --> 3:30:18.400]  State Colin Powell went on CBS Meet the Press and pointed to about January 22nd as the time a major
[3:30:18.400 --> 3:30:23.920]  international incident would force the new president to make unpopular decisions. While I take the
[3:30:23.920 --> 3:30:29.440]  general at his word, my best advice is to have your food in your possession prior to the inauguration.
[3:30:29.440 --> 3:30:35.520]  Contact eFoodsDirect.com for your supplies prior to this deadline for disaster. Ask yourself,
[3:30:35.520 --> 3:30:42.080]  is it better to have too much too soon or too little too late? Call 800-409-5633 or on the
[3:30:42.080 --> 3:30:50.880]  web eFoodsDirect.com. Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist
[3:30:50.880 --> 3:30:57.600]  act of war against this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[3:30:57.600 --> 3:31:02.720]  bin Laden. This is his M.O. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[3:31:02.720 --> 3:31:06.960]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to
[3:31:06.960 --> 3:31:11.760]  intelligence networks inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that there are
[3:31:11.760 --> 3:31:18.640]  Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some Israeli
[3:31:18.640 --> 3:31:24.320]  citizens have been detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI,
[3:31:24.320 --> 3:31:28.560]  the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games,
[3:31:28.560 --> 3:31:34.240]  the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com,

[3:32:59.280 --> 3:33:05.280]  Barack Obama is openly anti-gun and believes in banning all different types of rifles, handguns,
[3:33:05.280 --> 3:33:12.720]  you name it, banning gun shows, private sales. I mean, I've got a list of it here. It's unbelievable.
[3:33:12.720 --> 3:33:17.680]  His chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, is the guy that got his soul up and spanned past. He was the spearhead
[3:33:17.680 --> 3:33:23.440]  of that, and NAFTA. So now if you're against NAFTA and GATT, if you're against the North American
[3:33:23.440 --> 3:33:30.480]  Union, if you're against Obama saying he's going to spearhead this new global currency and the
[3:33:30.480 --> 3:33:37.680]  private banks setting up a quote, New World Order, that is change. That's accelerating the tyranny.
[3:33:37.680 --> 3:33:45.280]  That is change. That is bringing in world government. Now, again, Dr. Corsi has been sick.
[3:33:46.000 --> 3:33:50.320]  He's was one of the first interviews he's done since the election. We appreciate him being here
[3:33:50.320 --> 3:33:53.760]  and he's going to be back on more of the near future. He gets some rest. I do want to take
[3:33:53.760 --> 3:33:59.040]  some calls, but let's look forward. You've studied Obama. You've studied his handlers.
[3:33:59.040 --> 3:34:03.760]  You've studied the people he's bringing in. You've written a bestselling book about the
[3:34:03.760 --> 3:34:09.040]  North American Union, about how they would implode the US currency. Try to bring in a new global
[3:34:09.040 --> 3:34:15.760]  basket of currencies. Exactly that is now happening. He helps spearhead the banker takeover.
[3:34:15.760 --> 3:34:19.760]  When Congress wouldn't pass it, Obama went on TV and said, you've got to do this,
[3:34:19.760 --> 3:34:25.840]  and had his zombies call Congress, and then they rammed it through. So break down, Dr. Corsi,
[3:34:25.840 --> 3:34:29.280]  from studying these people, where you see them going in the future.
[3:34:29.280 --> 3:34:33.200]  Well, everything I wrote about in the late great USA is happening. In fact,
[3:34:33.200 --> 3:34:36.960]  Simon and Schuster asked me to do a paperback version of the late great USA.
[3:34:37.520 --> 3:34:43.360]  And I'm right now doing the new epilogue. If you saw it today, right now Reuters is running an
[3:34:43.360 --> 3:34:51.120]  article where there's going to be a speech given next week where Britain's Prime Minister Gordon
[3:34:51.120 --> 3:34:56.560]  Brown, it's a keynote speech he's going to give to an international conference saying
[3:34:56.560 --> 3:35:02.560]  that we need to have a global society. So now Britain is out in the age of saying this is the
[3:35:02.560 --> 3:35:08.720]  global age. They're using the crisis just exactly like I said would happen when I wrote the late
[3:35:08.720 --> 3:35:14.720]  great USA. I predicted we would have a dollar crisis. We have it. Now we've got both France and
[3:35:14.720 --> 3:35:21.680]  Germany out there saying we need to look to a global economy. Very few people saw it. I reported
[3:35:21.680 --> 3:35:28.720]  it in my red alert newsletter. Even the international monetary fund has given away like half a trillion
[3:35:28.720 --> 3:35:35.280]  dollars to emerging countries who can't meet their debts. Once that money's given away,
[3:35:35.280 --> 3:35:41.760]  the IMF will again own the emerging economies. We're basically running a situation where the
[3:35:41.760 --> 3:35:47.520]  governments are nationalizing the banks around the world. And the next step after they nationalize
[3:35:47.520 --> 3:35:53.920]  the banks is they'll nationalize the currency. These are the bits of progression that we're in
[3:35:53.920 --> 3:36:00.640]  and the crisis, this whole subprime crisis, which if you recall when I wrote the late great USA,
[3:36:00.640 --> 3:36:06.160]  I was predicting the subprime crisis. And Alex, I was predicting that we would see the same kind
[3:36:06.160 --> 3:36:12.240]  of unemployment that we're seeing right now in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan, where the jobs
[3:36:12.240 --> 3:36:20.320]  would be continuously going overseas. Also, this talk about how a global economy would save the
[3:36:20.320 --> 3:36:27.520]  US economy is nonsense. All we've done is throw the entire global economy into a global recession.
[3:36:27.520 --> 3:36:34.320]  This is our first global recession caused by this new world order thinking. And it will be used to
[3:36:34.320 --> 3:36:41.840]  create a new world currency. The push towards a North American Union will never be stronger
[3:36:41.840 --> 3:36:52.400]  than it will be under an Obama administration. Now, to be specific, I have the London Telegraph
[3:36:52.400 --> 3:36:59.680]  today with the headline, Gordon Brown Calls for New World Order to Beat Recession. I mean,
[3:36:59.680 --> 3:37:06.800]  this is so over the top, asinine, the hootsbub. Because they're out there openly, they're blatant
[3:37:06.800 --> 3:37:11.680]  now. Well, they are the ones that engineered this banking consolidation. They've taken the
[3:37:11.680 --> 3:37:17.360]  over trillion bucks that's been pumped into their gullets, their craws. It's already happened. Once
[3:37:17.360 --> 3:37:22.560]  the banks are nationalized, once the United States and Great Britain nationalize the banks,
[3:37:23.200 --> 3:37:29.520]  we've already moved into a government controlled economy. The next step is to move into
[3:37:29.520 --> 3:37:36.480]  a government controlled regional currency like the Amaro. If they don't just bypass the Amaro
[3:37:36.480 --> 3:37:43.360]  and go directly to a North American European currency, which now they could do, it's on the
[3:37:43.360 --> 3:37:49.920]  agenda. As Gordon Brown, by giving this speech, when I do the epilogue to the late great USA,
[3:37:49.920 --> 3:37:57.120]  I'm going to be saying that we slowed the agenda down by publicizing it. The work you did, Alex,
[3:37:57.120 --> 3:38:02.800]  the work I did, the work others to get out there and publicize it. But given the magnitude of
[3:38:02.800 --> 3:38:09.360]  this worldwide depression that's been intentionally caused, I think it's all overwhelmed. So the
[3:38:09.360 --> 3:38:15.040]  people will very quickly, instead of saying, look, we're in the verge of losing our homes, losing our
[3:38:15.040 --> 3:38:20.640]  jobs. Just like I wrote in the late great USA, if you cause enough fear, people will be willing to
[3:38:20.640 --> 3:38:28.080]  abandon economic sovereignty and economic control into a new world order that will have a new world
[3:38:28.080 --> 3:38:34.080]  currency, which is exactly where the banks and the government's pushing for these regional
[3:38:34.080 --> 3:38:38.720]  governmental structures. And by the way, you weren't flying blind. The architects of it,
[3:38:38.720 --> 3:38:45.760]  like Robert Pasteur, at the CFR said they would use terrorism and economic crises
[3:38:45.760 --> 3:38:52.880]  to get this in place. And they're openly saying a basket of world currencies regulated through
[3:38:52.880 --> 3:38:57.040]  an international private banking agreement. And like you said, they're telling the public,
[3:38:57.040 --> 3:39:02.240]  this is your only hope when going down this path is what will destroy the economy.
[3:39:02.240 --> 3:39:08.400]  Exactly. And I said this again, going back to July of 2007, when I wrote the late great USA,
[3:39:08.400 --> 3:39:13.040]  you're going to start seeing the next set of things, the Council on Foreign Relations, Ben
[3:39:13.040 --> 3:39:19.440]  Steele, which has already written one article saying that regional currencies are a thing
[3:39:19.440 --> 3:39:27.040]  of the past. The next push will be for getting a world currency, not just forget national
[3:39:27.040 --> 3:39:32.960]  currencies. They're already beyond that. I just got back from Africa. The main push in Africa
[3:39:32.960 --> 3:39:41.280]  right now is for an African currency. The African Union is the main push right now in Africa.
[3:39:41.280 --> 3:39:45.680]  Just the same as it's going to be in Asia. It's the same as it's going to be in Europe,
[3:39:45.680 --> 3:39:49.680]  and the same as it's going to be in North America. And that destroys their local sovereignty and
[3:39:49.680 --> 3:39:54.640]  brings them under regional governments. Precisely. And the same idea is that, look,
[3:39:54.640 --> 3:39:59.600]  they're going to say these economies are under such bad conditions. They'll blame it on George
[3:39:59.600 --> 3:40:05.440]  Bush when, you know, there's, Obama doesn't have a single idea that he's expressed so far,
[3:40:05.440 --> 3:40:11.280]  except to give more money away. I mean, you know, it's almost ridiculous. Why doesn't
[3:40:11.280 --> 3:40:17.440]  Obama just simply buy everybody their homes and give them to them, buy our mortgages and give
[3:40:17.440 --> 3:40:23.200]  them to us? Of course, the problem is, if they did that, the currency would be, you know, more
[3:40:23.200 --> 3:40:29.440]  every worth than worth. Actually, McCain said, buy off the bad part of the mortgages and let the
[3:40:29.440 --> 3:40:34.640]  people then have that reduction instead of just letting the banks ride it off and keep the profit.
[3:40:34.640 --> 3:40:42.400]  Well, probably what Obama said, no, all of it goes to the bankers. So he's really a cold, hard thief.
[3:40:42.400 --> 3:40:46.960]  What they're going to do is they're going to bail the bankers out, and Obama will participate.
[3:40:46.960 --> 3:40:51.440]  It's been bailing the bankers out. What they'll do is they'll consolidate,
[3:40:51.440 --> 3:40:57.760]  they'll go down to about a dozen world banks, consolidate them, they'll go to probably initially
[3:40:57.760 --> 3:41:05.920]  four or five regional world currencies, all of the way to having the Bank of International
[3:41:05.920 --> 3:41:12.480]  Settlement, the International Monetary Fund, and the UN be the major agencies in control
[3:41:12.480 --> 3:41:17.760]  economically. So the central banks of the individual countries will be minor details.
[3:41:18.400 --> 3:41:24.400]  Basically, they're going to say that the Paulson Bernanke plan failed, and what's necessary now
[3:41:24.400 --> 3:41:30.320]  is to move up to the next level of regional and international control. I'm predicting that's
[3:41:30.320 --> 3:41:34.400]  going to be the next immediate pressure you're going to start to see. Well, they've said they're
[3:41:34.400 --> 3:41:43.200]  doing that. And by the time late great USA is published out as a reprint, as a paperback,
[3:41:43.200 --> 3:41:48.160]  it's going to be well along the way. Simon Schuster has also asked me to do a reprint
[3:41:48.160 --> 3:41:54.080]  of the abomination, because again, most of the questions I asked of the abomination
[3:41:54.080 --> 3:41:58.640]  have never been addressed, addressed at all. Yeah, why didn't they release the original
[3:41:58.640 --> 3:42:04.000]  birth certificate? Well, in fact, I've been asked today, we had discussions all weekend with Joseph
[3:42:04.000 --> 3:42:09.440]  Farron, WorldNet Daily. WorldNet Daily is going right back onto the theme of the birth certificate.
[3:42:09.440 --> 3:42:14.640]  I'd say as soon as I get a little bit of rest here, maybe a week, we're going to be designing
[3:42:14.640 --> 3:42:20.560]  a strategy to go after these birth certificate issues. I've got a variety of theories I intend to
[3:42:20.560 --> 3:42:26.400]  pursue very directly as to who Obama really is, what the parentage really is,
[3:42:26.960 --> 3:42:30.960]  and what the birth certificates are really going to look like. I mean, you've already got
[3:42:30.960 --> 3:42:36.640]  being put into place, the basic fear of a world government with the American people being totally
[3:42:37.760 --> 3:42:42.880]  misled and fooled as to what's happening, because the structure of everything I argued,
[3:42:42.880 --> 3:42:48.800]  the necessity for a crisis, the necessity for the fall of the dollar. When I wrote the late
[3:42:48.800 --> 3:42:56.160]  great USA, back even when I was writing Black Gold Stranglehold, which was a year before that,
[3:42:56.160 --> 3:43:02.800]  in 2005, and I said then that oil would go to $100 a barrel, I was being ridiculed.
[3:43:03.440 --> 3:43:09.600]  People said it would never happen. And now that we've gotten oil down to about $65 a barrel,
[3:43:09.600 --> 3:43:15.600]  everybody's saying, isn't this great? Look, we've solved the problem. No, that's just been a relaxation.
[3:43:15.600 --> 3:43:23.600]  Oil is going to be back up to $145 a barrel. As the economy, the Dow Jones has down to $6,000,
[3:43:23.600 --> 3:43:30.560]  which is where I'm predicting. And I'm saying oil will again, you'll see gold had back over to
[3:43:30.560 --> 3:43:37.440]  $1,000 about. All these movements are already in progress. And for those who don't know,
[3:43:37.440 --> 3:43:42.560]  I mean, you've got a degree in this from Harvard. Well, also, I've been predicting over 25 years,
[3:43:42.560 --> 3:43:47.760]  I worked in financial services, I worked with banks around the world. Part of my job was always
[3:43:47.760 --> 3:43:53.200]  to do predictions. What world debt daily asked me to start doing at the end of last year was to
[3:43:53.200 --> 3:44:01.680]  prepare this, red alert.wnd.com newsletter. I've got the newsletter now fully prepared and designed.
[3:44:02.320 --> 3:44:06.480]  I kept it going even through the election. If we take a look at world debt daily today,
[3:44:06.480 --> 3:44:12.080]  you'll see one of the major articles. I posted on there that the next bottom number we're headed
[3:44:12.080 --> 3:44:17.680]  to in the stock market is $6,000. And Alex, there are thousands of people listening today.
[3:44:18.240 --> 3:44:24.080]  And I'm telling people, selling your stocks, people are usually told, hold on, the market's
[3:44:24.080 --> 3:44:30.560]  going to come back. Don't worry, your 401k will be back if you just hold on. I'm saying that's
[3:44:30.560 --> 3:44:36.800]  nonsense. If you've got one in the stock market today, sell it, get out of the stock market,
[3:44:36.800 --> 3:44:41.280]  which you've got left, because it isn't coming back. And if it does come back,
[3:44:41.280 --> 3:44:44.480]  it's not coming back quick. Doc, I want to take some calls before you leave us.
[3:44:44.480 --> 3:44:50.960]  But other predictions for the future. But before you do that, I want you to address
[3:44:50.960 --> 3:44:57.920]  the million man domestic spy force as big as the armed forces, the youth brigades,
[3:44:58.640 --> 3:45:04.800]  and the fact that Obama lies so much. I mean, they removed that off their website,
[3:45:04.800 --> 3:45:08.800]  and they're now saying it was never there, despite the fact we have the screenshots.
[3:45:08.800 --> 3:45:12.400]  I mean, this guy is already putting Bill Clinton to shame.
[3:45:12.960 --> 3:45:16.560]  Lying is nothing for Obama. Lying said, you know, Obama said they knew
[3:45:17.120 --> 3:45:20.320]  Ayers, because they lived in their neighborhood, and their kids went to school.
[3:45:20.960 --> 3:45:24.880]  I like Dennis Miller once pointed out to me, Obama's kids are two little girls,
[3:45:24.880 --> 3:45:29.920]  and Ayers' kids are all grown up, and less Ayers' kids were very slow. They never went to school
[3:45:29.920 --> 3:45:36.240]  a single day together. They are together because Ayers and Obama agree politically on a radical
[3:45:36.240 --> 3:45:42.080]  leftist agenda. You're going to see the same thing happen with this national, whatever kind of
[3:45:42.080 --> 3:45:49.040]  core it's going to be. It's going to be like a brown shirt effort to equip the youth and have them
[3:45:49.040 --> 3:45:54.640]  be a thought control brigade. We're extremely concerned about it over the world in that day.
[3:45:54.640 --> 3:46:01.360]  Like we also have one of the first following what this brown shirt brigade means, and expect
[3:46:01.360 --> 3:46:07.440]  lying to be the norm for Obama. Obama's very, very hard to pin down on the facts, but it's
[3:46:07.440 --> 3:46:12.320]  going to be very difficult. I know Jeremiah Wright is going to write a new book. You're
[3:46:12.320 --> 3:46:18.160]  going to see Rezco. Rezco right now is already spilling the beans on the governor. Federal
[3:46:18.160 --> 3:46:25.120]  prison is not very much fun to be in. I suspect Rezco will try to start talking about Obama soon.
[3:46:25.120 --> 3:46:30.640]  He'll look for a pardon. Rezco's only real chance to get out, and Obama's going to be
[3:46:30.640 --> 3:46:34.640]  pressured to give him a pardon. What do you expect Obama to do when he first gets in?
[3:46:34.640 --> 3:46:40.560]  I mean, he's openly saying... There's going to be a series of executive orders. Obama's not even
[3:46:40.560 --> 3:46:46.400]  going to bother with Congress. He's going to take five or six of his top agendas, whether they be
[3:46:46.400 --> 3:46:52.880]  abortion, or they be global warming, or they be stem cells, or whatever. He's just going to issue
[3:46:52.880 --> 3:47:02.240]  direct executive orders saying, this is now a fact. As Obama gets into power, as he begins to
[3:47:03.040 --> 3:47:08.800]  settle in, I think you're going to see the economics, all the idea that 95% of people are
[3:47:08.800 --> 3:47:13.920]  going to get tax cuts, although that's lies. There's going to be people out there who are
[3:47:13.920 --> 3:47:20.000]  expecting that Obama is going to pay their rent and pay their mortgages. Forget that. I think
[3:47:20.000 --> 3:47:25.280]  Obama's going to do very, very little for the poor in the country. He hasn't even done very much
[3:47:25.280 --> 3:47:31.440]  for the poor in his own family. I'll look. You constantly show... New people are showing up who
[3:47:31.440 --> 3:47:38.000]  in Obama's family have suffered poverty. He's done nothing for them. Obama's out for Obama,
[3:47:38.000 --> 3:47:43.200]  and I think you'll see a series of lies. The next thing also I expect is I expect there to be some
[3:47:43.200 --> 3:47:50.320]  major, major tests in the Middle East. I expect there to be major revival of terrorism.
[3:47:50.320 --> 3:47:53.200]  Well, we keep hearing that. I mean, Doc, you know...
[3:47:53.200 --> 3:47:58.240]  Somalia is going to be the next major station for terrorists. I think Somalia is easier to
[3:47:58.240 --> 3:48:03.440]  get to than the Afghan. And Somalia is going to be the next major base where the terrorists
[3:48:03.440 --> 3:48:09.840]  look to organize their training camps. Well, I mean, it's clear that they're preparing a crisis.
[3:48:09.840 --> 3:48:17.600]  Colin Powell is saying the 21st or 22nd, and then Obama can go blow up some training camps
[3:48:17.600 --> 3:48:22.400]  that may not even exist, then flex his muscles, and get hawks behind him.
[3:48:23.760 --> 3:48:30.880]  All the issues of violence, all the issues of seeing political terrorism are going to be issues
[3:48:30.880 --> 3:48:37.040]  used by the Obama campaign. Now the Obama presidency to gain power. I think the Obama
[3:48:37.040 --> 3:48:42.800]  presidency gaining power is going to make the Bush administration, steps the Bush administration
[3:48:42.800 --> 3:48:49.600]  took with these various presidential orders grabbing power in the case of emergency. They're
[3:48:49.600 --> 3:48:54.240]  there for Obama to use. I think you're going to see... That's what I was going to say next.
[3:48:54.240 --> 3:48:59.200]  The media keeps implying he's going to restore the Bill of Rights, but the Obama campaign is
[3:48:59.200 --> 3:49:04.000]  actually accelerating all the powers that Bush accrued. I think you're going to see the Patriot
[3:49:04.000 --> 3:49:08.800]  Act number two being introduced. I think you're going to see very much more radical control.
[3:49:09.520 --> 3:49:16.640]  There'll be an effort to control by reinstituting some kind of a fairness doctrine to shut down
[3:49:16.640 --> 3:49:21.600]  any criticism of Obama in the press. It'll be very much more difficult. I mean, look how difficult
[3:49:21.600 --> 3:49:27.600]  it was for me. I went to Kenya, researching Kenya the one day I'm trying to do a press conference.
[3:49:27.600 --> 3:49:33.920]  I'm arrested. And by the way, today in Africa, Oddinga is already saying he deserves the
[3:49:33.920 --> 3:49:41.200]  payback for arresting me because that helped elect Obama. So just wait to see the extent to
[3:49:41.200 --> 3:49:47.040]  which the press is suppressed under an Obama regime that really doesn't want any criticism at all.
[3:49:48.960 --> 3:49:53.120]  Well, I don't know why folks think having a black face is going to change anything
[3:49:53.120 --> 3:49:56.480]  when Obama works for the very same big Wall Street international firms
[3:49:57.040 --> 3:49:59.680]  that are looting the economy right now and he's a big cheerleader for it.
[3:49:59.680 --> 3:50:06.400]  Well, Obama got as much or more of his campaign contributions from the major Wall Street firms
[3:50:06.400 --> 3:50:12.560]  that McCain ever did. Way more. Way more. And I think you're right now in line for a reorganization
[3:50:12.560 --> 3:50:18.400]  of Wall Street and the one firm which survived, and I don't think it's accidental, Goldman Sachs
[3:50:18.400 --> 3:50:24.480]  thrived. Goldman Sachs thrived on the downturn of the housing. You've got Paulson. You've got any
[3:50:24.480 --> 3:50:29.840]  number of people from Goldman Sachs that will come out of this or give this administration and Goldman
[3:50:29.840 --> 3:50:35.040]  Sachs under the Obama administration will be the main Wall Street firm under which a Wall
[3:50:35.040 --> 3:50:40.080]  Street pretty organization occurred. See a consolidation of Wall Street since like you'll
[3:50:40.080 --> 3:50:44.160]  see a consolidation of banking. Particle integration. Not of course you stay there. We'll take some
[3:50:44.160 --> 3:50:51.040]  calls and we'll get back. More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water. And did
[3:50:51.040 --> 3:50:55.200]  you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when
[3:50:55.200 --> 3:50:59.840]  drinking the water? That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are
[3:50:59.840 --> 3:51:05.440]  absorbed into the skin. The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water and
[3:51:05.440 --> 3:51:10.960]  it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria,
[3:51:10.960 --> 3:51:17.440]  mold, algae and fungus. The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year
[3:51:17.440 --> 3:51:22.000]  whichever comes first. Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to
[3:51:22.000 --> 3:51:27.440]  reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria. What about you? Order your KDF shower filter

[3:54:06.000 --> 3:54:13.280]  Briefly, Dr. Corsi, because you know you're into economics. Does it even make you stand back though
[3:54:13.280 --> 3:54:19.280]  in awe to see the level of corporate looting and to openly see them announcing world government
[3:54:19.280 --> 3:54:23.840]  of and by the banks and that they're literally just taking trillions that we're going to have
[3:54:23.840 --> 3:54:28.400]  to pay back in tax money? It was amazing because again, I predict it now because
[3:54:28.400 --> 3:54:34.240]  that's what I wrote on Lake Ray USA. By the way, it'll never be paid back. What they'll do is they'll
[3:54:34.240 --> 3:54:40.240]  create a new currency. The new currency will essentially be a devaluation and so they'll
[3:54:40.240 --> 3:54:46.720]  basically forgive all of these loans that they're paying back. Right now the loans will be translated
[3:54:46.720 --> 3:54:53.440]  into equity and you'll see the next round being government ownership and international ownership
[3:54:53.440 --> 3:54:59.120]  because you'll see immediately the petrodollar states. We're already holding meetings with
[3:54:59.120 --> 3:55:03.360]  the Treasury. People know very little about. The Treasury is already holding meetings with
[3:55:03.360 --> 3:55:09.200]  the petrodollar states as to how sharia law can be introduced into the economics of the United
[3:55:09.200 --> 3:55:16.480]  States to invite petrodollar and investments. China is very angry. China hates seeing the
[3:55:16.480 --> 3:55:23.520]  investments that they've made. A lot of these subprime loans were sold to China. China wants
[3:55:23.520 --> 3:55:27.600]  to return on their money. China's going to want to see direct investment in the United States.
[3:55:27.600 --> 3:55:31.680]  By the way, I want to go back there. People don't know that sharia law is just Islamic law. They
[3:55:31.680 --> 3:55:36.240]  think it's drowning your daughter in the pool. They don't understand it's only one small part of it.
[3:55:36.240 --> 3:55:45.280]  One small part. Sharia law is so that larger international institutions can do business
[3:55:45.280 --> 3:55:51.120]  with those countries. Most of sharia law is about economics. Sharia law has fundamental
[3:55:51.120 --> 3:55:57.360]  controls over economics. Sharia law, when it comes to economics, is completely different
[3:55:57.360 --> 3:56:02.720]  than U.S. law. The rules are different. Interest is different. The handling of money, the handling
[3:56:02.720 --> 3:56:07.920]  of control, what you can and cannot do in a corporation is different. If you think that
[3:56:08.400 --> 3:56:13.440]  women are not, I just can't wait to see what the feminists are going to do
[3:56:13.440 --> 3:56:18.960]  once sharia law is imposed upon economic activity and banks. Be lucky to see women
[3:56:18.960 --> 3:56:25.920]  advanced in banks at all, or women advanced in corporations that are owned by Arab investors
[3:56:25.920 --> 3:56:31.520]  who are not fond at all of seeing women advance. It's going to be a fundamentally different world.
[3:56:31.520 --> 3:56:35.440]  Oh man, let's take some calls. I'm Mark in Boston and I'm Mark in Oregon. Patrick and
[3:56:35.440 --> 3:56:37.360]  Scott, we're trying to get you all in here. Mark, go ahead.
[3:56:37.360 --> 3:56:43.760]  Hi Alex. Thanks for having me on. Thanks Jerome for being on Alex's show again.
[3:56:45.280 --> 3:56:54.080]  I thought I had a lead for you. I went to a lecture with Linda Bilms and apparently you've
[3:56:54.080 --> 3:57:02.080]  already had her or her co-author of the book The $3 trillion War on your show. I asked her
[3:57:02.080 --> 3:57:08.240]  whether or not she would like to appear on your show and she said that she would indeed like
[3:57:08.240 --> 3:57:12.960]  to show up on the show. I had Stiglitz on who's now calling for world governments. We're getting
[3:57:12.960 --> 3:57:19.520]  back on to asking about our new world government we'll be under. By the way, before I forget,
[3:57:19.520 --> 3:57:24.560]  Dr. Corsi, if Limbaugh and Hannity would come out and talk about all this, I mean it's in the
[3:57:24.560 --> 3:57:29.200]  Boston Globe. It's in the Associated Press. Can't they come out and admit, okay, we were right.
[3:57:29.200 --> 3:57:34.160]  That is myself and you and others. There really is a world government or are they just going to
[3:57:34.160 --> 3:57:39.200]  say it doesn't exist even as the dollar goes on? I think they're going to be forced to come out now
[3:57:39.200 --> 3:57:44.560]  and look at what happens with the world government. Alex, in the next six months, the United States
[3:57:44.560 --> 3:57:49.680]  is strapped for capital. You're going to see a search for capital that is unprecedented. We're
[3:57:49.680 --> 3:57:54.560]  going to be with the petrodollar countries. We're going to be with the Chinese, with our negative
[3:57:54.560 --> 3:57:59.440]  balance of trade. We're going to be all over the world saying we need to recapitalize the United
[3:57:59.440 --> 3:58:05.440]  States and when we do, the United States will be for sale. We will not be in control the way we
[3:58:05.440 --> 3:58:09.040]  are today. Shine on announced today 500-something billion, quote, an economics demo, you know,
[3:58:09.600 --> 3:58:13.840]  that means, by the way, buying up the U.S. So, yeah, that's it. They blow out our economy by
[3:58:13.840 --> 3:58:18.880]  design, then take our tax money to buy us up. You've got to love it. They blow out our economy,
[3:58:18.880 --> 3:58:22.480]  then the international banks take our money and the name of the bailout, then they use it to buy
[3:58:22.480 --> 3:58:33.920]  us up. Stay there. I'll let you finish up, Mark. You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[3:58:36.880 --> 3:58:42.640]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against
[3:58:42.640 --> 3:58:48.560]  this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy? Bin Laden.
[3:58:48.560 --> 3:58:53.360]  This is his ammo. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden. Fabled
[3:58:53.360 --> 3:58:58.400]  Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks
[3:58:58.400 --> 3:59:03.680]  inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much
[3:59:03.680 --> 3:59:10.720]  engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:59:10.720 --> 3:59:16.000]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[3:59:16.000 --> 3:59:20.240]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much,
[3:59:20.240 --> 3:59:26.320]  much more. Fabled Enemies, get the DVD at infowars.com, or see it in super high quality,
[3:59:26.320 --> 3:59:32.720]  along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv. Either you are with us or you are with the
[3:59:32.720 --> 3:59:50.960]  terrorists.
