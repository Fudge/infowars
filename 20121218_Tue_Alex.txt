[00:00.000 --> 00:11.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.560 --> 00:19.080]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.080 --> 00:38.440]  Texas Alex Jones
[00:38.440 --> 00:43.920]  hi this is Mike Adams of naturalnews.com asking the question do guns kill
[00:43.920 --> 00:49.960]  people now I love my liberal friends on issues like GMO labeling and support for
[00:49.960 --> 00:56.160]  organics and even things like decriminalizing marijuana but recently
[00:56.160 --> 01:00.360]  my liberal friends have been telling me guns kill people this is a very popular
[01:00.360 --> 01:04.880]  meme apparently across the internet guns kill people and I find that very
[01:04.880 --> 01:09.000]  interesting because I've been carrying a gun for years that's never killed
[01:09.000 --> 01:13.520]  anyone so I thought today we would take a look and put a gun on the ground and
[01:13.520 --> 01:18.840]  film it and see if we can answer the question can a gun kill someone this is
[01:18.840 --> 01:25.460]  by Glock and this Glock is never killed anyone God forbid it hopefully will never
[01:25.460 --> 01:41.880]  be engaged in such an action ready kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill I know what
[01:41.880 --> 01:47.640]  you're thinking it's not loaded. Alright, let's make sure it's actually loaded.
[01:47.640 --> 01:56.080]  Show you the magazine. There's the mag. Rack and tap again. Boom. It is loaded and
[01:56.080 --> 02:02.880]  amazingly it's still not killing anyone. Maybe it needs a magic wand. Let's try the
[02:02.880 --> 02:26.360]  magic wand. Shoot something, shoot, fire, kill. It's just not working. What a
[02:26.360 --> 02:36.320]  pathetic firearm. I know what you're thinking. It's not a real gun. Oh, you're
[02:36.320 --> 02:43.200]  wrong. It is a real gun. And guess what it took to actually make it shoot? It took
[02:43.200 --> 02:49.360]  a human being touching the trigger, making a decision to pull the trigger in a
[02:49.360 --> 02:54.640]  safe direction, by the way. There's a backstop over that way. And actually having
[02:54.640 --> 03:00.880]  a conscious being do that. The gun didn't kill anything all by itself. Now, I know
[03:00.880 --> 03:05.040]  what you're thinking. Maybe handguns don't automatically kill people, but
[03:05.040 --> 03:13.160]  maybe shotguns do. Take our Benelli M4 tactical shotgun, which is another
[03:13.160 --> 03:17.880]  essential piece of equipment on just about any ranch. It's also great for
[03:17.880 --> 03:27.840]  home defense anywhere. Let's see if we can make this shoot by itself. Shoot, shoot,
[03:27.840 --> 03:43.000]  shoot. What a pathetic shotgun. I know the safety's on. There we go. Now it should
[03:43.000 --> 03:51.720]  shoot, right? Now it'll kill something. Go! Go! Now, some of you might think it's
[03:51.720 --> 03:56.400]  not loaded because I haven't pumped it. That's because it's an M4. You don't
[03:56.400 --> 04:03.120]  pump these shotguns, folks. They're semi-auto. Oh, semi-auto, yeah. Obama says I
[04:03.120 --> 04:09.520]  don't need a semi-auto shotgun. Therefore, I shouldn't have the right to own one.
[04:09.520 --> 04:18.240]  OK. What a pathetic shotgun. Let's see if it's actually going to shoot. It's gonna
[04:18.240 --> 04:27.720]  kick a little bit. Oh, I guess it is actually. Well, look at that. When you pull
[04:27.720 --> 04:32.600]  the trigger. That's a person, Mike Adams, in that video firing that shotgun. The
[04:32.600 --> 04:37.200]  shotgun didn't do it on its own, but they're all over the news. Even Republicans
[04:37.200 --> 04:41.760]  saying, the time has come. We can never have another mass shooting again. Now it's
[04:41.760 --> 04:45.120]  time for you to turn your guns in. And you're guilty for what others have done,
[04:45.120 --> 04:50.440]  what the collectivist authoritarians always do. It's a huge broadcast today.
[04:50.440 --> 04:53.760]  The globalists are coming after not just the second of them, but all of our
[04:53.760 --> 04:57.440]  liberties. Larry Pratt is coming up. We've got some breaking news here in Austin as
[04:57.440 --> 05:07.360]  well. Sodium fluoride in the body reduces IQ and increases cancers. Unfortunately,
[05:07.360 --> 05:12.600]  fluoride and its derivatives are only one of hundreds of toxins being added to
[05:12.600 --> 05:16.960]  our drinking water. We're battling the globalist on so many fronts. Health is
[05:16.960 --> 05:21.080]  an area where we can all take control of our lives, and it all starts with that
[05:21.080 --> 05:26.360]  basic building block of water. It is time to purify our family's water. The

[07:59.800 --> 08:08.800]  There's a need for new world order, but it has different characteristics in
[08:08.800 --> 08:17.240]  different parts of the world. Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide,
[08:17.240 --> 08:31.160]  it's Alex Jones. Ladies and gentlemen, it is Tuesday the 18th day of December 2012
[08:31.160 --> 08:37.240]  and supposedly in just three days from now the world is going to end. Obviously
[08:37.240 --> 08:42.200]  that is a complete hoax and a fraud, but there are all sorts of different violent
[08:42.200 --> 08:46.200]  things happening around the world and mass arrest in China dealing with
[08:46.200 --> 08:52.880]  different cults that say that they believe the world is about to end. I'll
[08:52.880 --> 08:57.760]  tell you what is about to end our second amendment. All the power structure has to
[08:57.760 --> 09:03.440]  do is to create the illusion that the general population is behind giving in
[09:03.440 --> 09:08.160]  our guns and claiming that's what the democracy wants and they will physically
[09:08.160 --> 09:12.560]  take all our guns. This is how they've done it in every other country and they're
[09:12.560 --> 09:19.200]  creating a mass hysteria right now over mass shootings that the media has been
[09:19.200 --> 09:23.160]  saying are actually up. They are up some this year, but in the 20-year average
[09:23.160 --> 09:28.440]  it's flat or up by 0.5% and I'm going to pull up some of those numbers later. Now
[09:28.440 --> 09:33.640]  mass shootings are a lot higher than they were in the 50s and 60s because you
[09:33.640 --> 09:39.960]  didn't have 60 plus million people on psychotropic drugs that say on the
[09:39.960 --> 09:48.240]  insert they can make you have psychotic breaks, engage in mass murder, engage in
[09:48.240 --> 09:53.160]  murder suicide. Every time I hear about someone just shooting people for no
[09:53.160 --> 09:57.120]  reason at a Walmart or shooting a cop who walks into Walmart I go that guy will
[09:57.120 --> 10:01.480]  be on psychotropic comes out three days later on psychotropic. I mean it's not
[10:01.480 --> 10:06.280]  hard. See there's evil people out there and there's bad people but most of them
[10:06.280 --> 10:10.880]  aren't so crazy as to just shoot a cop and call blood for no reason. Knowing if
[10:10.880 --> 10:15.200]  the cops don't shoot you back you're going to end up getting life in prison or
[10:15.200 --> 10:24.560]  the death penalty. It is the Prozac type SSRIs and SRIs that that destroy
[10:24.560 --> 10:30.880]  inhibition and put you in a mesmerized state and the good news is I listen to
[10:30.880 --> 10:35.400]  not one, not two, not three, but four different talk radio stations early this
[10:35.400 --> 10:38.920]  morning and then driving into work today and guess what I heard them talking
[10:38.920 --> 10:45.400]  about on every single channel. How we have record suicides in this country and
[10:45.400 --> 10:53.920]  covering ABC news articles and how the drug that now 20% of the population
[10:53.920 --> 10:57.200]  roughly is on. I mean I say the drugs is basically the same thing just
[10:57.200 --> 11:02.880]  different patented variants of it different molecule breakdowns. How the
[11:02.880 --> 11:09.280]  SSRIs are what is really causing this so this is very good news. There are a lot
[11:09.280 --> 11:12.160]  of different factors a lot of different things that feed into this.
[11:12.160 --> 11:17.280]  Societal decline, Pentagon designed first shooter games that create instinctive
[11:17.280 --> 11:22.880]  shooting so these gamers who are also out of their minds are trained on
[11:22.880 --> 11:26.320]  something originally developed by the Pentagon to create instinctive shooting
[11:26.320 --> 11:29.400]  because about half the troops historically of any army won't kill
[11:29.400 --> 11:33.600]  somebody up close with these games it's almost a hundred percent so they're
[11:33.600 --> 11:38.080]  also trained on how to use firearms in firearms simulators. You know how you
[11:38.080 --> 11:43.080]  first learn how to fly a plane in a simulator especially the big ones? This
[11:43.080 --> 11:48.680]  is a killing simulator. You got people some people upwards of 8 to 10 hours a
[11:48.680 --> 11:54.280]  day in murder simulators in killing simulators and then you put them on a
[11:54.280 --> 11:59.160]  hallucinogenic psychotropic drug and you've got the culture of absolute
[11:59.160 --> 12:03.120]  violence and by the way Quentin Tarantino is saying he doesn't care he's sick of
[12:03.120 --> 12:10.480]  it he's not apologizing for Jango. That is in the words of Jamie Foxx I kill all
[12:10.480 --> 12:14.840]  the white people isn't that great on Saturday Night Live and see it's so
[12:14.840 --> 12:21.120]  fashionable to say kill white people right now that you've got Asian rappers
[12:21.120 --> 12:25.680]  saying kill you know destroy white people in America and all the stuff as if
[12:25.680 --> 12:29.840]  America is all white. Whites are about to be the minority we already are in
[12:29.840 --> 12:35.520]  people under about 18 and you've got all these rappers saying kill whiting and
[12:35.520 --> 12:40.560]  all this with Hollywood pushing this guess what's breaking in the news right
[12:40.560 --> 12:45.000]  now and our reporters are on the way down there right now if you want to go
[12:45.000 --> 12:48.480]  down there and join them and you want to go down there if that guys you pull up
[12:48.480 --> 12:53.200]  the Thai noodle house address I mean it's right there on Guadalupe, we
[12:53.200 --> 12:58.480]  Texans I guess call it Guadalupe but it's Guadalupe the main drag of
[12:58.480 --> 13:04.480]  University of Texas I have eaten at the Thai noodle house it's actually pretty
[13:04.480 --> 13:13.840]  good stuff one time I eaten there with Tinky Friedman of all people and now
[13:13.840 --> 13:19.960]  there it is 2602 Guadalupe Street Austin Texas 787-05 our guys will be down
[13:19.960 --> 13:24.160]  there in about 30 minutes I just told them right before we went live on air to
[13:24.160 --> 13:27.680]  get you know get their sports jackets on get their equipment and go down there
[13:27.680 --> 13:32.240]  and he has come out where's the Huffington Post Thai noodle house
[13:32.240 --> 13:36.400]  restaurant in hot water after racist Sandy Hook shootings comments and it was
[13:36.400 --> 13:44.120]  first broken by our local affiliate 590 a.m. that ran with the headline that he
[13:44.120 --> 13:52.160]  said so what you know so what these are white kids you know who cares and I'm
[13:52.160 --> 13:55.560]  gonna go over his full quotes later but that's not yeah there it is at news
[13:55.560 --> 14:00.320]  radio 590 Kelby J Thai noodle house owner post controversial remarks following
[14:00.320 --> 14:03.920]  Connecticut shootings at Austin restaurant owner has garnered national
[14:03.920 --> 14:07.800]  attention and threats after he post controversial remarks on his Facebook
[14:07.800 --> 14:14.400]  account Eddie Nima Bertur owner of the noodle house near the UT campus posted
[14:14.400 --> 14:20.280]  inflammatory remarks on his Facebook account just hours after the Sandy Hook
[14:20.280 --> 14:27.760]  massacre happened he said quote I'm failing to give a bleep about the
[14:27.760 --> 14:32.640]  Connecticut shooting I don't care much why kids get killed he goes on to tell
[14:32.640 --> 14:37.240]  readers to get back to their lavish Christmas shopping he deleted the post
[14:37.240 --> 14:41.560]  later but another rant saying he would not apologize was added yeah we were
[14:41.560 --> 14:47.880]  able to get actually the full full pages it is unbelievable the stuff he said and
[14:47.880 --> 14:52.240]  again it's this attitude because again you know I don't get into a bunch of
[14:52.240 --> 14:56.680]  race stuff I I care about everybody because we're the human race but I mean
[14:56.680 --> 15:05.360]  the left if you tune into MSNBC it is just race baiting world if you own guns
[15:05.360 --> 15:10.240]  you're a Ku Klux Klan member you know Fox Sports says that too if you don't
[15:10.240 --> 15:14.400]  want socialism you're a racist if you are white and live in the South you are
[15:14.400 --> 15:18.320]  a mentally retarded redneck I mean I hear him say it on radio you've seen it
[15:18.320 --> 15:22.560]  on TV you've seen the comments everywhere and also mean to mentally retarded
[15:22.560 --> 15:28.720]  people and their families mentally disabled and it's incredible I mean you
[15:28.720 --> 15:32.400]  got Alec Baldwin constantly saying kill this Republican kill that Republican and
[15:32.400 --> 15:35.920]  folks you know I can't stand the Republican leadership Boehner as I
[15:35.920 --> 15:41.680]  predicted is caving in on all the estate taxes massive even more increases than
[15:41.680 --> 15:45.680]  what they first talked about getting rid of all the exemptions taxing people down
[15:45.680 --> 15:50.240]  to 125,000 a year that is not rich folks that's who actually keeps the economy
[15:50.240 --> 15:57.120]  going and buy stuff but the my issue is the Democrats they're carrying the ball
[15:57.120 --> 16:01.040]  for the New World Order they're the ones moving it down the field and they can
[16:01.040 --> 16:06.640]  get away with anything I'll guarantee you folks if I got on air when there was
[16:06.640 --> 16:11.560]  say a gangland shooting in Chicago where a couple black kids got killed and if I
[16:11.560 --> 16:15.560]  said who cares they're just you know inner-city black kids you know paraphrase
[16:15.560 --> 16:20.320]  quote I don't think that I'm not saying it they'll cut it out of context I would
[16:20.320 --> 16:26.960]  be destroyed in a matter of weeks I would be off all my affiliates it would be
[16:26.960 --> 16:32.600]  over I mean Dr. Laura Slesinger just tried to say hey let's demystify the
[16:32.600 --> 16:36.880]  n-word and stop giving it so much power and the system knew the public was so
[16:36.880 --> 16:41.760]  dumbed down that they misconstrued what she said and basically ran her off the
[16:41.760 --> 16:45.440]  radio for being one of the biggest shows in the country at one time rivaling
[16:45.440 --> 16:51.440]  Rush Limbaugh this is how they do it and and it's all about annihilating the
[16:51.440 --> 16:55.920]  first amendment so this guy has a right to say hey they're just white kids so
[16:55.920 --> 17:04.240]  white I have a right though to say I think it's despicable and when you've
[17:04.240 --> 17:10.400]  got Jamie Foxx up repeatedly on television not just on not just on
[17:10.400 --> 17:12.800]  Saturday night while I've now discovered he was on some other shows saying the
[17:12.800 --> 17:19.440]  same thing to exploit people to make money it's called race baiting folks it's
[17:19.440 --> 17:24.600]  what people would do in the South to demonize blacks so they could take the
[17:24.600 --> 17:28.320]  general public's rights this is how this always works you know that's when
[17:28.320 --> 17:31.400]  people finally in the South turned against slavery because only about two
[17:31.400 --> 17:36.160]  percent of the population you can look this up had quote slaves most rich
[17:36.160 --> 17:39.880]  people had white slaves who'd come over here as indentured servants they don't
[17:39.880 --> 17:43.840]  teach that in school but that's the main line history of you dig most of you
[17:43.840 --> 17:47.600]  myself included have some sharecroppers some indentured servants you'd sign on
[17:47.600 --> 17:53.360]  for a seven or ten year trial of service you'd go to prison if you didn't
[17:53.360 --> 18:00.240]  follow it and you came over here on a boat as a slave but you see you never
[18:00.240 --> 18:04.520]  got out of it because you would get in debt for your shoes your shirt any
[18:04.520 --> 18:08.600]  medicine you might need any you know any food you needed above the allotment you
[18:08.600 --> 18:12.880]  were given and so there are sharecropping families all over the US who
[18:12.880 --> 18:20.720]  are mainly white who are who are 7th 8th 9th 10th 12th generation my dad grew up
[18:20.720 --> 18:25.600]  around some 6th generation sharecroppers in Texas white people now once
[18:25.600 --> 18:31.280]  blacks fought for their rights and whites fought with them they actually quote
[18:31.280 --> 18:35.560]  became free but just became sharecroppers and that's where the old
[18:35.560 --> 18:42.160]  blues song of I owe my soul to the company store and many historian pointed
[18:42.160 --> 18:48.560]  out that sharecropping was even worse than slavery because for whatever
[18:48.560 --> 18:52.120]  reason when when when the people didn't think they completely owns you they
[18:52.120 --> 18:55.160]  treated you even worse and they could compete with other sharecroppers
[18:55.160 --> 18:59.720]  anybody who's seen grapes of wrath the movie that's a small snapshot of
[18:59.720 --> 19:03.200]  sharecropping type stuff going on the 20th century but I digress I'm gonna get
[19:03.200 --> 19:08.200]  into the huge absolutely devastating gun knows that is exactly what I feared and
[19:08.200 --> 19:11.400]  saw coming but even worse than I thought they are creating an absolute
[19:11.400 --> 19:15.240]  hysteria but the main reason the abolitionists became popular for about
[19:15.240 --> 19:20.880]  1800 into 1860 from less than 2% being abolitionist to the majority in the
[19:20.880 --> 19:25.920]  north a large group in the south was whites finally figured out wait a minute
[19:25.920 --> 19:29.040]  I go along with slavery because it because I get to feel like I'm better
[19:29.040 --> 19:34.200]  than somebody and many editorials written about this but really we're even
[19:34.200 --> 19:40.680]  the lowest on the totem pole and these big plantations actually also run
[19:40.680 --> 19:45.800]  sharecropping operations were all slaves so it was that realization that
[19:45.800 --> 19:50.800]  actually began the end of slavery and similar things happened in the Caribbean
[19:50.800 --> 19:54.880]  as well there was even more slavery okay we'll be right back with the huge news

[25:22.920 --> 25:26.160]  you let's but we knew this was coming it's even worse than we thought now let's
[25:26.160 --> 25:31.800]  punch up drudgereport.com if you look there it's got Nancy Pelosi
[25:31.800 --> 25:36.080]  celebrating a baner he demands you calling baner I don't know why it's wrong
[25:36.080 --> 25:40.800]  to call him by his names really pronounced boner boner adopts Pelosi plan I
[25:40.800 --> 25:45.040]  don't mean that as a kid joke folks that's really his name so I'm not gonna
[25:45.040 --> 25:50.040]  follow his orders anymore that's like Brett Favre is really how do you really
[25:50.040 --> 25:54.640]  pronounce look at him it's a nice sound Favre yeah Favre is his real name not
[25:54.640 --> 26:00.440]  Brett Favre and your name is boner okay you got that speaker of the house
[26:00.440 --> 26:07.760]  boner adopts Pelosi plan and folks the Pelosi plan is to give the president the
[26:07.760 --> 26:12.960]  power to just raise the debt limit whatever he wants and basically meet the
[26:12.960 --> 26:18.440]  president halfway instead of 990 billion in new taxes and 600 billion of
[26:18.440 --> 26:24.440]  exemptions gone and accepting his 3.8 Obamacare and all this other stuff it's
[26:24.440 --> 26:28.640]  just give Obama whatever he wants I mean of course why do you think they put
[26:28.640 --> 26:35.080]  boner in there boner Favre or whatever his name is they they put him in there
[26:35.080 --> 26:42.800]  because he's a globalist stooge okay and we are in mucho grande trouble because
[26:42.800 --> 26:47.600]  just as I told you the Republicans would cave cave cave cave cave cave cave
[26:47.600 --> 26:54.280]  cave cave cave cave cave cave because the same megabanks finance the
[26:54.280 --> 26:58.000]  Republicans that finance Obama they're just frontmen this is what they want the
[26:58.000 --> 27:04.960]  mega rich want millionaires money and you know Boehner had said hey you know
[27:04.960 --> 27:10.760]  I'll just go for the million dollar plan people making a million and more a
[27:10.760 --> 27:15.320]  year and remember you pay overall about half of that in some form of tax or more
[27:15.320 --> 27:20.760]  so that's people making $450,000 a year that's the people that buy the boat and
[27:20.760 --> 27:24.960]  buy the nice house and go to your restaurant they're all gone oh oh by
[27:24.960 --> 27:27.280]  the way I'm gonna get into all the gun stuff after the break but let me cover
[27:27.280 --> 27:30.440]  this right now I always pronounce his name wrong but I've seen some of his
[27:30.440 --> 27:36.640]  movies he's pretty good actor Gerard Depardieu Depardieu my wife will kill me
[27:36.640 --> 27:42.800]  she's got a degree in French and grew up there the point is is that they have a
[27:42.800 --> 27:50.320]  75% income tax on top of any taxes over a million euros a year okay and
[27:50.320 --> 27:55.760]  and conservatively you add all the French taxes together it's over 80% but
[27:55.760 --> 28:09.120]  this is a federal of 70% and then a 75 on top of that and France warned him you
[28:09.120 --> 28:13.400]  know that he better not leave and insulted him and you know called him all
[28:13.400 --> 28:17.240]  sorts of names well now there's a huge exodus of their football players you
[28:17.240 --> 28:21.680]  know their soccer players they call the football over there and of their movie
[28:21.680 --> 28:26.720]  stars they're just all leaving they're leaving to other countries like Belgium
[28:26.720 --> 28:35.080]  that oh they only have a 50% tax rate oh my gosh so low that's one tax 50% can
[28:35.080 --> 28:40.560]  you imagine being Depardieu or however you pronounce it and this guy has made
[28:40.560 --> 28:47.160]  France just an icon in cinema and he's not he said he's not gonna be able to
[28:47.160 --> 28:55.840]  keep his house he can't afford it he's got to leave can you imagine what is if
[28:55.840 --> 28:59.680]  you already pay 70 plus percent or more in some form of tax and then they put
[28:59.680 --> 29:04.960]  another 75% on top of what you've got what does that let you keep what's 75
[29:04.960 --> 29:14.280]  percent on say 20% what's left it's like 5% or something of your money so in
[29:14.280 --> 29:18.160]  France if you make over a million dollars a year you get to keep five six
[29:18.160 --> 29:24.720]  seven percent what is it you got 20% you get to keep the 75% tax on that what's
[29:24.720 --> 29:29.600]  that come out to my brain just says 5% we'll come back from the break with that
[29:29.600 --> 29:34.720]  math and public school educator left use a calculator the point is France is the
[29:34.720 --> 29:38.760]  global model of taxes but guess who's exempt from taxes in France and in every
[29:38.760 --> 29:46.160]  other European country the 3.75 that's what he gets to keep 3.75 the the EU
[29:46.160 --> 29:54.280]  bureaucrats are exempt we're on the March the empires on the run Alex Jones

[33:28.080 --> 33:34.440]  okay again make specific on this whole Nancy Pelosi thing they're debating
[33:34.440 --> 33:40.040]  whether they're gonna tax people it 250,000 400,000 a million none of it
[33:40.040 --> 33:45.920]  even matters because massive taxes on upper middle class and wealthy people
[33:45.920 --> 33:51.320]  will only stall this economy the real power elite the real elites are the
[33:51.320 --> 33:56.000]  ones lobbying for this because they're able to exempt themselves from the
[33:56.000 --> 33:59.720]  increased taxes and if you're a new listener and you think I'm joking
[33:59.720 --> 34:06.640]  about what I was just covering the fact that EU bureaucrats are exempt from the
[34:06.640 --> 34:10.920]  EU wide taxes and many of the national taxes through what they gave themselves
[34:10.920 --> 34:14.280]  diplomatic immunity go look it up yourself and you've all heard about
[34:14.280 --> 34:18.800]  Google paying almost no taxes or General Electric paying zero or these megabanks
[34:18.800 --> 34:24.240]  paying almost zero it's the big ultra-rich that want government to shut
[34:24.240 --> 34:29.160]  down their competition here's the report Pelosi backed boners tax cut
[34:29.160 --> 34:34.600]  proposal so that's the media spinning and here out of Buzzfeed that she's
[34:34.600 --> 34:38.920]  backing his plan he's really going with her plan speaker of the house John
[34:38.920 --> 34:45.120]  boner plan B to avert the fiscal cliff would cut taxes for incomes under one
[34:45.120 --> 34:49.520]  million a higher threshold than the White House demands but one that had a
[34:49.520 --> 34:56.840]  powerful backer house minority leader Nancy Pelosi in May Pelosi sent boner a
[34:56.840 --> 35:02.640]  letter calling for the immediate passage of a middle-class tax cut up to that
[35:02.640 --> 35:06.920]  level while President Barack Obama was on the campaign trail or Barry Cetero
[35:06.920 --> 35:13.160]  calling for taxes to rise on incomes of over $250,000 that's the husband and the
[35:13.160 --> 35:18.040]  wife though by the way so that's 125,000 a piece the White House has since raised
[35:18.040 --> 35:25.600]  the target at 400,000 in ongoing negotiations with boner but has shown
[35:25.600 --> 35:29.880]  few signs it would accept the 1 million level Democrats believe the tax cuts
[35:29.880 --> 35:34.040]  for those earning over a million dollars a year should expire and that we should
[35:34.040 --> 35:39.880]  use the resulting revenues to pay down the deficit said Pelosi and it goes on a
[35:39.880 --> 35:43.600]  month earlier on the Charlie Rose show Pelosi went further noting Democratic
[35:43.600 --> 35:49.120]  opposition to the $250,000 mark in our caucus there is a school of thought that
[35:49.120 --> 35:53.440]  says let's get rid of all the tax cuts yeah that's why you've seen Howard
[35:53.440 --> 35:57.680]  Dean come out and say race taxes on poor people folks they're not stupid they
[35:57.680 --> 36:04.560]  know when you habitually raise taxes it does what it lowers tax receipts
[36:04.560 --> 36:10.760]  Kennedy cut the highest tax bracket by 35% he cut the next tax bracket and all
[36:10.760 --> 36:17.880]  the others by 50% what happened the next year in 1962 what happened to tax
[36:17.880 --> 36:24.000]  receipts you can pull up mainstream articles on this they doubled doubled
[36:24.000 --> 36:28.680]  doubled doubled but the real issue here is the different plans and they're
[36:28.680 --> 36:36.880]  changing all the time are between 1.6 trillion and 900 something billion over
[36:36.880 --> 36:42.800]  the next couple years in tax increases but they get rid of the tax exemptions
[36:42.800 --> 36:51.240]  like your tax exemption on interest on your home loan things like that that's
[36:51.240 --> 36:55.440]  going out the window they have their way and again I mean I hate to laugh at
[36:55.440 --> 36:58.040]  people that support big government and think it really wants to give you
[36:58.040 --> 37:01.880]  something free I mean they're only bringing the illegal aliens in and
[37:01.880 --> 37:05.200]  saying they're above the law and letting them you know vote and drunk drive and
[37:05.200 --> 37:07.600]  not have driver's license because they're going to drive down the wages and
[37:07.600 --> 37:10.760]  create a new voting block that's all that's for once they've been taken the
[37:10.760 --> 37:14.720]  country down they'll be just as enslaved or more and it's the same thing they
[37:14.720 --> 37:19.240]  only bring in these blocks and they only try to domesticate people and get them
[37:19.240 --> 37:23.560]  on welfare to have a dependency class but the globalist are totally ruthless
[37:23.560 --> 37:27.280]  and see you as dumb animals you don't get into the upper power structures of
[37:27.280 --> 37:32.440]  government now if you're not totally ruthless and have the right friends in
[37:32.440 --> 37:35.560]  high places and that's why they want to shut down the rest of the free market
[37:35.560 --> 37:38.800]  so that we can never threaten them down here in the grassroots that's why they
[37:38.800 --> 37:42.040]  want to consolidate the internet and the media and have everything basically be
[37:42.040 --> 37:49.360]  state run and how is NBC and ABC and CBS and all the rest of them state run they
[37:49.360 --> 37:54.760]  all are owned in part or in whole by megabanks Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Bank
[37:54.760 --> 37:58.480]  of America looking up there's six companies on the media now the so-called
[37:58.480 --> 38:02.440]  dinosaur media well the so-called a mainstream media which I call the
[38:02.440 --> 38:07.720]  dinosaur media six of them oh by the way that's in the entire Europe the
[38:07.720 --> 38:12.360]  United States England that's the West Australia is included in that six six
[38:12.360 --> 38:17.440]  companies all interlocking and it's megabanks that that basically control
[38:17.440 --> 38:20.640]  them all just like the insurance companies just like defense companies
[38:20.640 --> 38:26.880]  because they have unlimited fiat money and they don't want freedom in this
[38:26.880 --> 38:29.800]  country and that's why they're moving had to disarm us and I'm getting to our
[38:29.800 --> 38:36.160]  top stories here in a moment but what you need to understand about all of this
[38:36.160 --> 38:39.840]  media and why it's the same story every night in the same order and why
[38:39.840 --> 38:44.120]  suddenly Fox News is even saying hey maybe we should ban semi-autos assault
[38:44.120 --> 38:48.440]  weapons well it's because the owner is a globalist Rupert Murdoch who came out
[38:48.440 --> 38:53.160]  and said ban assault weapons over the weekend and he's so ignorant he said
[38:53.160 --> 39:00.760]  full autos they don't sell full autos in the gun shops you have to get a special
[39:00.760 --> 39:05.480]  ATF background check and sticker and get enrolled it takes months and plus the
[39:05.480 --> 39:10.680]  military doesn't even want full auto semi-autos much more dangerous but they
[39:10.680 --> 39:18.960]  use ignorance on the media's behalf not just in the general public's to sell
[39:18.960 --> 39:24.720]  this idea that it's so incredibly scary that people got what the military has
[39:24.720 --> 39:30.040]  oh my gosh and they've got these movies where whole houses get get blown up when
[39:30.040 --> 39:33.040]  somebody's got a machine gun or somebody's got an assault rifle the
[39:33.040 --> 39:38.720]  issue here though is and what I'm really trying to get at is that we really do
[39:38.720 --> 39:43.000]  have a state-run media because banker bailout money and the government giving
[39:43.000 --> 39:48.480]  us the six mega banks that control the six big media combines they are given
[39:48.480 --> 39:54.600]  unlimited fiat currency through derivatives government through the
[39:54.600 --> 39:58.800]  Federal Reserve licensure through the private Federal Reserve gave them the
[39:58.800 --> 40:04.120]  power to create out of thin air or an Aladdin's lamp or a magic wand whatever
[40:04.120 --> 40:13.480]  amount of wealth they want it is that simple and their religion is globalism
[40:13.480 --> 40:17.760]  and war and dehumanization and mind control and social engineering and
[40:17.760 --> 40:22.360]  brainwashing and propaganda that's what they're pushing that's what they're
[40:22.360 --> 40:29.960]  establishing that's what they're creating and we as a republic we as a
[40:29.960 --> 40:34.080]  country are in deep trouble because these banks that control our media are
[40:34.080 --> 40:38.000]  globalist and are diametrically opposed to all of our basic freedom so
[40:38.000 --> 40:43.240]  government licensure for unlimited fake capital derivatives and other fraudulent
[40:43.240 --> 40:54.400]  fractional reserve frauds are then connected in to the state-run media
[40:54.400 --> 40:58.320]  that's what it is and it's a combine between state-run because some of its
[40:58.320 --> 41:03.520]  direct taxpayer money in bailouts and stimulus money and behavior placement is
[41:03.520 --> 41:08.960]  what they call it paying for different themes and movies that is state-run
[41:08.960 --> 41:14.920]  media so I've noticed that when we talk about this the system gets very very
[41:14.920 --> 41:21.200]  upset very very scared and really starts to lash out because it's hitting at the
[41:21.200 --> 41:25.400]  core and the heart of who they really are and what they really stand for
[41:25.400 --> 41:29.560]  because once the public figures out folks it isn't a conservative bias on
[41:29.560 --> 41:35.800]  Fox it isn't a liberal bias on MSNBC it is psych warfare global corporate
[41:35.800 --> 41:40.840]  propaganda to overthrow our country and reduce us down to absolute slaves
[41:40.840 --> 41:45.800]  because the banksters who are wrecking our country and and and who are
[41:45.800 --> 41:50.880]  consolidating our industries and who are shipping our jobs overseas to third
[41:50.880 --> 41:55.640]  world dictatorships and authoritarian systems they control so they can make
[41:55.640 --> 42:00.000]  bigger profits shipping their products back in when the public figures out that
[42:00.000 --> 42:05.040]  we're really occupied by an occupational corporate power structure with
[42:05.040 --> 42:11.480]  the propaganda arms of state-run media it's game over for these people we still
[42:11.480 --> 42:14.920]  have independently owned AM and FM stations we just got three or four more
[42:14.920 --> 42:20.040]  affiliates this week I'm gonna plug them in a moment we still have the internet
[42:20.040 --> 42:26.160]  and citizen journalism we have four limited time they're moving to shut that
[42:26.160 --> 42:30.240]  down that's now on record yeah there's Business Insider these six corporations
[42:30.240 --> 42:35.080]  control 90% of the media in America that's right and then they have a whole
[42:35.080 --> 42:38.680]  breakdown map in that Business Insider report this excellent very accurate for
[42:38.680 --> 42:42.160]  my research but the point is we're putting that up on screen if you're a
[42:42.160 --> 42:48.720]  prison planet dot TV member what I'm getting at here is they've taken over
[42:48.720 --> 42:56.240]  through fraud and they can't let us ever wake up to that or it's game over and
[42:56.240 --> 43:02.880]  they know statistically we are going to wake up to this because it things are
[43:02.880 --> 43:09.720]  going to get so bad under their agenda 21 program of total control and so it's
[43:09.720 --> 43:14.800]  a life-and-death situation to get the word out on who these people are and
[43:14.800 --> 43:23.200]  what they really stand for it's that simple and if we don't have a
[43:23.200 --> 43:27.720]  realization of that and if we don't see the mainstream media in coordinated
[43:27.720 --> 43:34.480]  attacks openly saying it's time for the American people to just be reasonable
[43:34.480 --> 43:38.200]  we can't allow our children to die if you don't turn your guns in you're a
[43:38.200 --> 43:43.040]  child killer the idea because a psychopath under psychiatric care a
[43:43.040 --> 43:49.840]  video game undoubtedly on psychotropic drugs goes out and kills 20 people we've
[43:49.840 --> 43:55.520]  now got to lose our rights just like oh terrorists supposedly attack us and so
[43:55.520 --> 43:59.360]  now we've got to have the TSA stick their hands down our pants and give us
[43:59.360 --> 44:04.720]  prisoner training no this is a corrupt establishment that knows that they've
[44:04.720 --> 44:09.120]  committed all these crimes and they're going to go to jail they're either going
[44:09.120 --> 44:14.240]  to totally take over and set up authoritarian domination or they're all
[44:14.240 --> 44:19.080]  going to go to jail so they're going for authoritarianism and they're going for
[44:19.080 --> 44:24.680]  divide and conquer they're going for creating artificial division this is
[44:24.680 --> 44:30.680]  what they're pushing for and that's why they are just psychologically using
[44:30.680 --> 44:36.160]  these poor little kindergarten children to throttle the public into submission
[44:36.160 --> 44:43.920]  and creating an artificial mass exodus away from guns in the media that is
[44:43.920 --> 44:48.920]  actually 180 degrees the opposite from reality I'm gonna go over the news now
[44:48.920 --> 44:54.680]  but here's the point the globalist no ladies and gentlemen and they now
[44:54.680 --> 44:59.320]  admit this because when you watch Discovery or History Channel or A&E or
[44:59.320 --> 45:04.720]  any of these almost every show is about people going back to the land people
[45:04.720 --> 45:11.160]  butchering their own poultry and beef people shooting firearms people cleaning
[45:11.160 --> 45:17.720]  firearms people making firearms people in competitions and suddenly what I've been
[45:17.720 --> 45:23.400]  seeing for a decade is now coming out mainstream women everywhere are buying
[45:23.400 --> 45:29.040]  guns see it's who's buying guns minorities are buying guns groups so
[45:29.040 --> 45:32.000]  liberal thinking the media and the government was their friend that they
[45:32.000 --> 45:36.800]  were scared of guns their whole lives and just you on average and just let the
[45:36.800 --> 45:40.360]  gangbangers have guns they're going out and getting guns and I meant to print
[45:40.360 --> 45:45.040]  this guys we print the FBI's new crime statistics just came out overall violent
[45:45.040 --> 45:48.640]  crime has dropped petty crime when when they know you don't have a gun they
[45:48.640 --> 45:52.000]  knock out your window and steal something out of your car that's up but
[45:52.000 --> 45:58.520]  violent crime is actually down shootings are actually down these numbers came out
[45:58.520 --> 46:03.680]  last week we're gonna go through some of those later sure Larry Prattle want to
[46:03.680 --> 46:09.000]  talk about them but what is up in the last 30 years is mass shootings now it's
[46:09.000 --> 46:13.000]  flat in the last 20 roughly this last year has been particularly bad year but
[46:13.000 --> 46:18.480]  overall it's flat but it has increased in the last 30 you know we saw that
[46:18.480 --> 46:23.600]  increase in the 80s into the 90s and now it's planed off but it's still 88
[46:23.600 --> 46:29.520]  people on average a year automobile accidents close to 30,000 you know dear
[46:29.520 --> 46:33.960]  200 or more falling in your pool thousands and thousands number one
[46:33.960 --> 46:38.280]  cause of unnatural death suicide didn't even used to be in the top five why is
[46:38.280 --> 46:42.840]  it now as they put people on suicide bills 20% of the population roughly is
[46:42.840 --> 46:49.760]  on suicide bills so what they're doing is they're creating this mass hoax that
[46:49.760 --> 46:54.200]  hey you're in the Ku Klux Klan if you own a gun you're a bad parent if you own
[46:54.200 --> 47:01.920]  a gun you should have your children taken from you if you own a gun and
[47:01.920 --> 47:08.880]  they're canceling some of the highest rated shows Discovery Channel cancels
[47:08.880 --> 47:14.360]  American guns in response to the shooting when all it is is well I mean
[47:14.360 --> 47:16.880]  look at the cover of American guns right here if I'm gonna have a document
[47:16.880 --> 47:23.880]  cam shot it's women up there firing firearms right next to men and the
[47:23.880 --> 47:28.200]  groups complaining said they made it sexy they made it cool they made it fun
[47:28.200 --> 47:32.560]  they demystified it actually have the quotes here that's exactly what they're
[47:32.560 --> 47:36.880]  scared of they are so scared of that woman looking like Wonder Woman up there
[47:36.880 --> 47:42.400]  with a firearm a real empowered woman a real in-charge woman a woman who
[47:42.400 --> 47:46.800]  discovers she can protect herself and not be scared I get so sick of when I'm
[47:46.800 --> 47:50.120]  on the hiking bike trail sometimes you see women out there by themselves and
[47:50.120 --> 47:54.960]  he looks so scared because a man walks by him in the woods but then you can
[47:54.960 --> 47:58.160]  always see a woman who's got a fanny pack on you know who's got a gun she
[47:58.160 --> 48:01.640]  doesn't look scared at all and she's and they're a lot more friendly so they
[48:01.640 --> 48:10.320]  canceled this show it saw a 50% increase in its second season alone in top
[48:10.320 --> 48:20.000]  demographics and was the number two show on the Discovery Channel and here's our
[48:20.000 --> 48:23.480]  article breaking down it that said complaints about the show centered around
[48:23.480 --> 48:28.880]  the fact that it made buying owning guns seem fun glamourous even normal and not
[48:28.880 --> 48:34.480]  inappropriate you see oh my gosh it's inappropriate we're winning this is a
[48:34.480 --> 48:39.560]  desperate last-ditch panic they've got at the Treasury they've taken down
[48:39.560 --> 48:44.280]  America they've got 20% of the public on deadly suicide drugs still though a
[48:44.280 --> 48:48.520]  large portion is waking up not trusting the government getting back to common
[48:48.520 --> 48:53.000]  sense understanding you got to take care of yourself and it's a culture that's
[48:53.000 --> 49:02.880]  got black white Hispanic Asian Arab Jew German Chinese everybody is getting
[49:02.880 --> 49:06.160]  into guns the statistics show that the last decade just up and up and up and
[49:06.160 --> 49:10.120]  up and crime rates are now dropping everywhere with a gun saturate they're
[49:10.120 --> 49:17.040]  plunging it's a new chivalry culture of you're out there to defend it's what
[49:17.040 --> 49:22.040]  they fear not vigilanteism but that you are a silent guardian and the criminals
[49:22.040 --> 49:25.040]  know it so they're flocking to Chicago they're flocking to New York and
[49:25.040 --> 49:29.480]  bringing those cities down where the crime chiefs are in command so the crime
[49:29.480 --> 49:33.200]  chiefs are in their armored fortresses of New York and Chicago feeding on their
[49:33.200 --> 49:37.160]  people knowing that the courts are overturning their victim disarmament
[49:37.160 --> 49:42.560]  knowing we're awakening so now they've come out and canceled TV ads and
[49:42.560 --> 49:52.000]  marketing for the new Tom Cruise movie Jack Reacher they are canceling screenings
[49:52.000 --> 50:03.560]  of Django they are in they are canceling TV shows and Cerberus seek sale of

[50:13.160 --> 50:15.920]  ago for a bite of all the big gun companies and I said folks these people
[50:15.920 --> 50:20.320]  have unlimited money it's not about making money and it's top globalists that
[50:20.320 --> 50:25.240]  are involved former Treasury Secretary snow they are now organizing with the
[50:25.240 --> 50:29.720]  universities and police funds and the pension fund programs to pull out of the
[50:29.720 --> 50:35.480]  highly lucrative gun market see this is going to be a full economic attack folks
[50:35.480 --> 50:39.920]  they're gonna play dirty Obama will sign orders banning importation and you
[50:39.920 --> 50:44.200]  watch the gets away with that the sale and then physically having handguns and

[51:02.840 --> 51:07.160]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation
[51:07.160 --> 51:10.520]  could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new
[51:10.520 --> 51:14.440]  energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[51:14.440 --> 51:18.640]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[51:18.640 --> 51:23.080]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[51:23.080 --> 51:27.840]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[51:27.840 --> 51:31.640]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[51:31.640 --> 51:35.240]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[51:35.240 --> 51:39.560]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[51:39.560 --> 51:42.720]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power

[55:11.920 --> 55:16.560]  actually talked to big Discovery Channel execs and others and we're like five
[55:16.560 --> 55:20.600]  six years ago talking to them and they were watching how popular videos were
[55:20.600 --> 55:24.160]  on YouTube of guns being shot they were seeing videos getting millions and
[55:24.160 --> 55:27.680]  millions of views some of them like 50 million views with budgets of maybe a
[55:27.680 --> 55:31.760]  thousand dollars and they were saying yeah no we want to do gun shows we know
[55:31.760 --> 55:35.160]  they'd be big I mean I've been in the meetings with these people when they
[55:35.160 --> 55:38.800]  were pitching me shows and stuff but we don't know when get it by the execs the
[55:38.800 --> 55:43.440]  execs caved in mid-level got huge ratings they know what America wants they
[55:43.440 --> 55:47.600]  know where America went they know the gun culture took over we were born out
[55:47.600 --> 55:53.440]  of the gun culture and it sprung forth in the face of 9-11 in Katrina and and
[55:53.440 --> 55:57.920]  Sandy people know the government's predatory they the Congress has a nine
[55:57.920 --> 56:03.600]  percent approval rating and so they are the power structure is gonna come out
[56:03.600 --> 56:09.000]  and say everyone hates guns now everyone's running from them pediatricians the
[56:09.000 --> 56:13.680]  parents have them CPS them no law they're just saying it it's a hoax it's
[56:13.680 --> 56:17.200]  just like I hear people on talk radio going I wish we could spank our kids
[56:17.200 --> 56:20.680]  back when we could spank kids you know we had a lower crime rate it's not
[56:20.680 --> 56:25.720]  illegal to spank your kids people I wish it wasn't the law I have to take
[56:25.720 --> 56:30.640]  vaccines there's no law it's all a hoax so they're going no more gun shows you're
[56:30.640 --> 56:33.840]  right Hollywood's gonna stop showing gun violence of course they're not really
[56:33.840 --> 56:40.400]  gonna do that yeah it's time to turn them in and this weekend talking to
[56:40.400 --> 56:43.920]  McBrain he said one of our reporters he said you watch they're gonna have guys
[56:43.920 --> 56:48.480]  in John Deer hats on the news saying I'm a Vietnam vet it's time to turn my gun
[56:48.480 --> 56:53.720]  in and he did a report on that last night I don't know if it aired yet he was
[56:53.720 --> 56:56.520]  working on it last night I didn't watch the news last night I was too busy in
[56:56.520 --> 57:00.840]  fours nightliness seven o'clock central and and he had all these clips where
[57:00.840 --> 57:04.560]  they've got these guys going yeah I used to believe in guns but I'm turning them
[57:04.560 --> 57:08.880]  in for the kids and it's all staged folks and people are like I guess I got to
[57:08.880 --> 57:12.480]  turn my guns in Obama cried folks you got a better chance being struck by
[57:12.480 --> 57:16.200]  lightning dying in a mass shooting 88 have died so far this year in mass
[57:16.200 --> 57:22.920]  shootings over 150,000 died from bacteria in hospitals looking up number
[57:22.920 --> 57:26.280]  one cause of quote unnatural death they don't count bacteria is unnatural
[57:26.280 --> 57:30.520]  suicide it's upwards of 30,000 you don't hear people asking why that's
[57:30.520 --> 57:34.680]  happening or they say we need more mental health money it's mental health
[57:34.680 --> 57:41.080]  causing it putting people on these drugs they knew full well when they took
[57:41.080 --> 57:44.600]  spanking out of the public schools 25 30 years ago would make people unruly and
[57:44.600 --> 57:50.000]  out of control their answer then drug them they knew full well folks they know
[57:50.000 --> 57:54.240]  what they're doing so here's the announcement this is it just like I
[57:54.240 --> 57:56.880]  said in the December issue of the magazine that was published three weeks
[57:56.880 --> 58:01.560]  ago this man wants your guns they're coming for your guns they've got them
[58:01.560 --> 58:04.520]  everywhere else in the world but Switzerland they're trying to get them
[58:04.520 --> 58:09.640]  in Switzerland now they're coming for the guns and there's all these idiots
[58:09.640 --> 58:13.200]  that cinnamon have a sentimentality who are good people but they're manipulated
[58:13.200 --> 58:17.440]  going I just think Obama really is crying and he really cares and it's time
[58:17.440 --> 58:22.480]  to turn them in think of the idea that because crazy people are out there you
[58:22.480 --> 58:27.040]  should turn in your guns or I should turn in mine use your head folks that's
[58:27.040 --> 58:31.320]  collectivist if a guy robs the bank down the street from you do you go to jail
[58:31.320 --> 58:35.440]  if somebody runs over somebody with a car do you have to turn your car in folks
[58:35.440 --> 58:40.680]  they're coming for the guns this is the biggest push ever

[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:36.240]  also got popping in representative Walter Jones congressman Walter Jones on
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:41.080]  this issue of the Second Amendment a lot more on the fiscal cliff what's
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:45.240]  happening with the troops now they've sent 3,000 troops back to Iraq there's
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:49.200]  tens of thousands of contractors there US troops are staying in Afghanistan it's
[01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:55.520]  just awful the UN gun treaty has been leaked it does ban guns and ammo we're
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:01:00.880]  gonna be going over that again I saw these crime statistics last week and the
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:05.240]  guys just tried to search it during the break the new FBI unified crime
[01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:09.640]  statistics have been released I'm gonna dig those out overall violent crime I
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:14.840]  see one of the biggest drops the last two decades mass shootings are up a little
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:19.720]  bit but mainly flat over 20 years but again those are the big events kind of
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:25.560]  like jaws where for two years and I've shown the news articles on this subject
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:30.280]  we should show them again beaches not just in the US but around the world saw
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:36.280]  in some cases more than 70% of their patrons just not going to the beach or
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:39.840]  not getting in the water and they would ask them they said well jaws is out there
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:44.360]  it'll it'll eat me and it didn't matter if on average there's five great white
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:51.520]  deaths a year worldwide because of the movie people for several years would not
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:57.640]  get into the water and it's the same thing people really think people are
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:01.640]  gonna it has another effect though people are pulling their kids out of
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:06.960]  public schools everywhere thinking mass shooters are gonna come shoot them even
[01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:10.040]  though that statistically is where these guys go because they know no one's
[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:13.120]  gonna be there opposing them this is a victim disarmament zone still
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:17.440]  statistically even being in a government training camp what is there 20
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:20.560]  something million people in public schools last time it's more than that I
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:25.440]  mean the chances 88 dead and mass shootings half of those are more gang
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:29.320]  related it's gangs killing each other and they call it a mass shooting of the
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:33.800]  senseless stuff you know 40 or something or less I mean and I'm not
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:36.720]  encouraging you to go to government training camp it'll give you deadly GMO
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:41.200]  food and inoculate you with government brainwashing and force shots and they
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:45.360]  may take your 11-year-old to have an abortion without your consent I mean you
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:48.200]  know I wouldn't go to a government training camp because of that but the
[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:52.320]  fact that see they like some of the shootings to get the guns and also
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:56.240]  train everybody that the schools are prisons for prisoner training perp
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:03:00.120]  training for the children not discipline just learning how to be a
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:04.560]  prisoner kind of like the airports are a prisoner prisoner training for
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:13.280]  everybody so we've got all that unfolding and then at the same time though
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:17.160]  they don't want people to totally be scared of the public schools or then
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:20.400]  you won't put them in there so they can lower your test scores lowest in the
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:26.960]  world and have you know seven percent graduation rates and but 12% passing the
[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:31.760]  SAT rates so there's a real desire to wreck them and we've got the Department
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:35.760]  of Education documents on that from the most educated most informed most
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:41.200]  individualistic country in the world just 60 years ago to lowest IQ's lowest
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:44.880]  test scores the industrialized world highest cancer rates in the world you
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:50.760]  know the list goes on and on the globalist are absolutely wrecking our
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:57.400]  society at every single level we always seem to have trouble with Larry Pratt
[01:03:57.400 --> 01:04:02.560]  Skype he has Skype he has ISD in line and he has telephones let's just go
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:05.920]  telephone because it'll go into the next segment it seems to always do that
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:10.600]  with him for whatever reason I just my elephant memory I don't remember this

[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:25.440]  coming up but here's one of the articles the most recent decline in US violent
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:30.280]  crime is different from the last one and it breaks down some of that but this is
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:35.640]  from this is from yesterday so this is new but we're gonna get into more of
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:40.400]  those numbers coming up so so see violent crimes dropping and why is that
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:45.880]  happening oh we have the maps we know why gun ownerships going up and concealed
[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:49.840]  carries going up in the states where that's happening as the concealed carry
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:53.480]  goes up crime goes down because every citizen of the concealed carry is

[01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:57.040]  children these 20 dead children saying it's time to not just ban assault rifles

[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:23.840]  that blame the Second Amendment and you remember gunners of America from their
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:28.200]  congressional sources he was just on a month ago but to give credit the NRA as
[01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:34.000]  well said our intel is they're gonna try to physically ban guns in the next four
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:39.080]  years and now it's happening and they are milking it they have the biggest gun
[01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:45.640]  manufacturer in the country dumping freedom group a Cerberus group run by
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:50.600]  banksters run by the former Treasury Secretary snow but I want to show you
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:57.680]  the new FBI crime statistics that have come out they have a drill down from 93
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:03.120]  to 2010 and just last week they released the last two years numbers look at the
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:08.560]  giant drop in violent crime following gun ownership increasing and following
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:12.240]  concealed carry and they have it in a state-by-state this is the gun grabbing
[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:16.840]  Justice Department that ran fast and furious real violent crime is dropping
[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:21.160]  because of gun ownership and we're gonna be again if you're a radio listener
[01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:26.080]  I'm showing this on television now I want to get Larry Pratt on because I've
[01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:32.760]  never in all of my 17 years on air or decades of researching this and talking
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:35.720]  to people that have been there for a long time fighting for our liberties
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:41.720]  seem such an all-out hysterical total assault and now a lot of Republicans and
[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:46.880]  the owner of Fox News Murdoch saying it's time to turn in the guns and now
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:51.040]  they're saying we're members of the Klan if we own guns they're now death
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:54.880]  threatening the NRA and others they're death-threading info wars calm they
[01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:58.520]  tell me on my YouTube's we're gonna shoot you we're gonna kill you and I go to
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:03.560]  their sites these are real people so they believe that the second amendment
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:08.680]  something the Ku Klux Klan was the first to get restricted after the civil
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:14.120]  war they are now claiming we are the Ku Klux Klan because we want everybody to
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:17.840]  be able to protect themselves they're panicking the gun culture is taking over
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:22.200]  and winning they're admitting this liberals are buying guns so they know
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:29.560]  this is their last desperate push to restrict now Larry Pratt founder or head
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:34.280]  head chairman he has been executive director gun owners of America for over
[01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:41.920]  30 years gun owners got ORG he joins us now Larry am I wrong to say this is the
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:47.040]  greatest assault we've ever seen it seems to be shaping up that way you can
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:53.480]  never tell which murderous outrage will provoke this kind of a response but this
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:58.480]  one seems to be the one that they were looking for the crisis that they are not
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:05.320]  going to let go to waste and they apparently are so far they've been
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:10.480]  somewhat successful in getting people to not consider a very simple proposition
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:16.320]  if it's so bad to have guns in school then which room would you rather your
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:22.040]  child be in the classroom in which the teacher has no gun and an assailant with
[01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:26.920]  a gun is coming through the door or another classroom where the teacher
[01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:31.680]  does have a gun and another assailant with a gun is coming through the door
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:39.080]  and I think if you put it like that the question kind of answers itself so all
[01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:46.200]  of this chatter is simply intended as a distraction to keep the American people
[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:53.600]  off guard and and our guard down so that these politicians can come in and and do
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:59.120]  what they like to do which is to control and they're not even interested so much
[01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:06.920]  in guns per se as controlling us that's what gun controls all about and I
[01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:11.160]  surmise that the politicians have determined that this is the moment and
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:18.320]  when even somebody like Marco Rubio is starting the cave then the yellow
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:24.320]  streak running up a Republican spine is going pretty mainstream well what's
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:29.000]  happening is the power brokers the big mega banks that have bankrupted this
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:33.320]  country they want to disarm the American people so we can fully be brought
[01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:36.480]  into tyranny it's not just the second amendment under attack it's the first
[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:41.320]  it's the fourth it's the fifth it's the tenth on every front the globalist
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:45.520]  realize that America was really starting to awaken so this fraudulent
[01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:52.160]  election Obama this is a false mandate they're saying to carry out all of their
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:55.440]  different frauds and the power structure is rightfully scared of the
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:14:00.120]  American people now you're up there you know the best no compromise second
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:05.520]  biggest lobby or the second amendment we're seeing rhetoric well here it is
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:11.160]  out of the Atlantic here it is out of other you know publications going after
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:15.560]  the NRA saying they're a hate group they're bad well they're a hate group
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:19.960]  he must be Satan incarnate according to these victim disarmament people you know
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:25.960]  the thing that's I find so amusing is if they are willing to accuse the gun
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:34.840]  lobby as being part of KKK the easiest way to refute that is I haven't voted
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:41.880]  Democrat in quite some time and yet the KKK literally was the action arm of the
[01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:47.800]  Democrat Party when instead of bribing blacks with money they were
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:53.960]  intimidating blacks with guns this has been the Democrat Party all along and
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:15:00.400]  to try to cast this over onto the Republicans or anybody else just doesn't
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:06.520]  fly but that's the kind of use the word desperation that's I agree I think
[01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:11.720]  they're very desperate and even if what they say doesn't make sense they're
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:15.880]  just fluttering right now and let's expand on that though they they do have
[01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:22.080]  more people in the Senate Obama is not facing reelection we know that Bloomberg
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:25.360]  who thinks he's president of the United States or dictator he says take
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:30.080]  executive action what are you getting from the Hill what are the attacks that
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:33.640]  we're expecting to see we know Feinstein's reintroducing me the
[01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:40.360]  semi-auto ban well my concern has been and I may have expressed this on one of
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:45.200]  our earlier conversations Obama has shown that he doesn't care what the law
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:51.080]  is he doesn't care what the Constitution is in his opinion I want and
[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:58.160]  therefore in his lack of understanding of American government willfully I think
[01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:05.280]  is that I got 51% of the vote therefore I can do anything I want well I can see
[01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:11.480]  him issuing an executive order saying to gun stores who depend on him for their
[01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:17.960]  daily bread if he pulls their gun license their federal license they're
[01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:22.720]  finished that day they're out of business they can sell no more guns well if
[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:29.200]  he threatens to do that unless they not sell handguns over a certain caliber
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:35.840]  not sell rifles that can accept a high capacity magazine that's it by the way
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:40.560]  as you know last year the ATF put out a public comment period on banning most
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:43.840]  shotguns if they quote could be bottom-loaded they said they could be
[01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:49.040]  converted and and they're already banning importation of you know Russian
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:53.040]  shotguns and things so they're already doing things outside of law or quote
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:58.320]  under the radar that's right he gave us many signals both in the Second
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:02.800]  Amendment area you just pointed to a very good one how he illegally and
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:07.320]  unconstitutionally banned the importation of those shotguns he did the same
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:14.280]  thing with the re-importation of some rifles from Korea M1 Garands perfectly
[01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:20.480]  fine basically target gun kind of heavy to lug around but you know nice thing to
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:25.600]  have a collector's item if you will 50 year old 60 year old type of gun ban
[01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:31.480]  re-importation of those so now that he's got no concerns about re-election I'm
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:36.080]  very concerned that things like I was sketching out are likely to take place
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:44.080]  we have elected a communist dictator and he is rapidly exploring the limits of
[01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:49.720]  how far he can go before he gets any feedback and you've never talked like
[01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:54.520]  that but he says that the UN and NATO's of our military he signs an executive
[01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:58.240]  order to take over the internet and won't let Congress see it but lets the UN see
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:02.280]  it and they brag oh it gives us control shuts down power plants outside of law
[01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:09.040]  I mean he just does whatever he wants whatever he wants I'm very concerned and
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:13.360]  of course there's a there's a practical way that he can be dealt with but
[01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:20.680]  unfortunately it requires vert took brah it requires backbone and that's
[01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:26.200]  something that Republican leadership in the Congress seems to be very no
[01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:29.160]  instead they're getting in line and you're up on the hill every day what is
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:35.960]  happening on on tax increases on borders on guns the Republicans are saying hey
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:40.840]  we're with you destroy America converted they seem to think that their
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:46.520]  reelection based on a Republican platform which was pretty good it doesn't
[01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:51.000]  mean anything that really the American people are clamoring for what Obama's
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:56.320]  trying to do and as you say they're just putting up the white flag it's really
[01:18:56.320 --> 01:19:00.600]  very disgusting well that's how they get the Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Bank of
[01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:04.080]  America money I mean the same groups are paying for it all and they want the
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:07.840]  American people shut down and enslave so they can get unlimited banker bailouts
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:12.240]  we're going to break here with a final segment with you but I mean it's a full
[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:18.680]  on assault taking gun shows off TV you know saying we're murderers because of
[01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:23.080]  these kids when mean meanwhile the FBI's own numbers Larry shows that violent
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:27.040]  crimes going down it's going down there are fewer school shootings than ever
[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:32.280]  before it's the media tells you it's getting worse the truth is it's the
[01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:37.560]  opposite and Obama says we can never allow this to happen again and and let's
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:42.320]  be loving and does the fake crying Larry Pratt gun owners.org you can sign up

[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:18.800]  been a Judas go they supported the 68 gun control act they were created by the
[01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:22.480]  federal government after the Civil War not saying the NRA is bad they've got a
[01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:27.440]  better board now but big money once our guns it's not just the communists it's
[01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:30.960]  not just the liberals they just want a big government to feed off of the big
[01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:35.840]  mega banks they're the ones that want it Larry in closing all I can say is gun
[01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:41.280]  owners are being told you know oh you're guilty so you need to you know feel like
[01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:45.200]  you've murdered these children and so I guess if somebody runs over somebody
[01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:48.680]  with a Ford pickup truck I've got a Ford pickup truck you know do I need to feel
[01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:52.160]  guilty and go turn my Ford pickup truck in I'm saying all these headlines about
[01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:58.680]  police are looking at the bushmaster ar-15 it killed the kids I mean what do
[01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:03.440]  we do I say get back in their face like your article said the blood is on their
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:09.200]  hands what do we do sir I I'm glad you put it that way get back in their face
[01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:14.640]  these people are not superior they do not have superior knowledge they do not
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:20.320]  have the moral high ground we need to point out what is the fact they have
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:25.920]  the blood on their hands it is their constant yammering about how bad guns
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:29.920]  are and how we need to keep them away from everybody and out of schools and
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:34.400]  all of that that we've made it so that if a teacher has a gun at school they're
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:39.400]  breaking the law and the criminals the mass murderers go to their facilities to
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:46.800]  kill it year after year after year after year and we're still told the same
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:53.000]  thing that guns don't belong in schools well isn't that just wonderful how's
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:58.320]  that been working out for you I I'm just so glad that that chap in that mall out
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:03.960]  in Oregon had disregarded the no guns posting I imagine he was committing a
[01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:08.000]  trespass or something but he would not have been able to run to the sound of
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:12.920]  the shots when a couple of people were murdered had it not been for him having
[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:18.960]  that gun and when the killer saw him approach with his gun that's when the
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:24.560]  killer decided to check out game over and shot himself that should have been
[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:29.000]  the way it happened in the school there should have been some teacher there
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:35.720]  some janitor there saying you know what the idea of some penalty applying to
[01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:39.800]  self-defense I'm not I don't know that I'd really be worried about being
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:44.600]  prosecuted if the only time they knew that I had a gun was when I use it to
[01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:48.760]  save their sorry lives now if it falls out on the floor and there's no danger
[01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:54.640]  then yeah you be another issue but if the gun is successfully concealed then
[01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:59.360]  and there's no need for it there'll be no issue but if there is a need for it
[01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:04.320]  and we keep advertising to the to the nutjobs of our country come to school
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:09.280]  and shoot me then I think it's time that we have a few surprises waiting for them
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:13.560]  the next time mr. Pratt I have an idea and I know it's similar to what other
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:17.280]  people have said but you've got sheriff's departments who can deputize
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:22.080]  people and get around the federal law not letting guns in schools why not sit
[01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:27.000]  there and say hey retired sheriff's deputies they'll do it for free I
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:32.120]  guarantee you know how about half you know half a day a couple times a week you
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:35.600]  go in and then you'd have enough people to cover it all the time and you can
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:39.520]  basically pose as janitors or something just even tour has a similar idea and
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:45.200]  just be in there with your firearms and be deputized sheriff's deputies and the
[01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:50.000]  problem is solved and they don't have to use these these rare school shootings
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:54.880]  as a as a bloody shirt to wave to disarm the American people I think you have a
[01:27:54.880 --> 01:28:00.320]  great idea and in fact you could even deputize the teachers and they could be
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:06.440]  packing at the same time but as long as they're deputized they're good to go I
[01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:11.960]  love it I think we ought to I'm gonna look into that and if that's as good as
[01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:16.780]  I think it's it is we're gonna get the word out to some of our sheriffs well
[01:28:16.780 --> 01:28:20.640]  I earlier was showing us some crime statistics break broken down every
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:26.440]  demographic but here's the general crime statistics for 2011 from 2007 massive
[01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:30.480]  drop in violent crime this is the Justice Department's own numbers and
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:35.680]  it's been dropping Larry for 20 years as what goes up gun ownership as gun
[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:40.560]  ownership goes up as professor lot shows as gun ownership goes up crime goes
[01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:47.600]  down the criminals are evil they're not stupid and when they run into more and
[01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:53.000]  more victims who are armed word kind of gets around that you got to be more
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:57.760]  careful these days it's a not the same job environment it was under Jimmy
[01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:03.920]  Carter final question here what do you predicts gonna happen if he tries to
[01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:08.720]  physically say turn in these semi-autos well he's gonna have to do it by
[01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:13.080]  executive order because I don't see it going through the Congress I know we've
[01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:17.360]  had some defections but I still think that at the end of the day they're
[01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:21.520]  gonna hear from their constituents when they start waffling on this they're not
[01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:24.960]  gonna get the kudos the media was telling them they were going to get so
[01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:32.000]  that's one and I just think we continued doing what we're doing getting the word
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:37.280]  out making sure that people do know that even somebody like a Marco Rubio has
[01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:43.160]  cave okay folks you in Florida pick up the phone you got work to do that's the

[01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:19.680]  All right we only got about a minute or two left for Larry Pratt he's gonna do an interview with Reuters
[01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:24.640]  store locked down in Barton Creek Mall after report that somebody saw a gun
[01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:28.600]  there's all sorts of panicking everywhere people are seeing folks with
[01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:32.080]  paper bags they're calling the police just like people wouldn't go in the
[01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:37.920]  ocean for two years after Jaws came out in the 70s five great white deaths a year
[01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:41.480]  people wouldn't go swimming anywhere they knew Jaws was in there ready to kill
[01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:46.440]  them is this not mass mind control Larry Pratt in closing we're seeing where
[01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:50.640]  where the system is throwing everything it's got at the public to terrorize us
[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:55.680]  into turning in our guns I mean what's happening a huge amount of hysteria
[01:33:55.680 --> 01:34:01.920]  the it wasn't long ago I was in a store here in Virginia I was at the counter
[01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:07.160]  near the door being attended by the clerk a guy walked in through the door
[01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:12.840]  with a gun in his holster the clerk looked up saw that that's what was going
[01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:17.520]  on and went back to giving me my change no big deal it all depends on where the
[01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:22.720]  gun is and you'd like to find out about this mall sighting of a gun where was
[01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:27.400]  the gun was it in a holster or was it in a hand in a menacing position we're
[01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:30.640]  not told those little things those are kind of important and it's quite
[01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:36.560]  possible that there was an overreaction I hope that's all it was I know you've
[01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:41.440]  got to go it's just I've never seen them this big of a push trying to make guns
[01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:45.640]  taboo they know our culture of liberty is taking over what else can we do other
[01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:50.640]  than supporting gun owners well I think just in general raise the roof tell
[01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:54.240]  these members of Congress to hold tight that you didn't send them there to to
[01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:58.120]  take away our freedoms you sent them there to fight and if they don't want to
[01:34:58.120 --> 01:35:01.200]  fight we'll get somebody else that will and again they're panicking because we've
[01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:04.760]  been having all these federal and state court rulings overturning the Illinois
[01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:10.440]  handgun ban concealed ban all of it they're losing they are losing we are
[01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:17.120]  winning public opinion when this whole fight started for me decades ago three
[01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:21.320]  cores the American people was on the other side now less than half we're
[01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:27.320]  making progress and this is not the time to go soft this is not the time to put
[01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:32.160]  up the white flag this is the time to to do exactly what we've been doing because
[01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:36.320]  we are winning what do you make in closing of the gun
[01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:40.000]  manufacturer the biggest in the country apologizing and blaming the gun
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:43.800]  opening themselves up for liability and saying they're gonna dump all their
[01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:48.560]  gun holdings six giant made America factories well it just tells me who I'm
[01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:53.360]  not interested in patronizing at least the parent company I'm just not
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:57.760]  interested in in helping people that have that sort of an attitude they've

[01:36:58.620 --> 01:37:06.720]  linked on the right hand column you can go there and Facebook is is now
[01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:14.400]  banning you heard me right Facebook is now suspending or banning accounts that
[01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:20.320]  question official narrative on the shooting in fact since Watson wrote this
[01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:25.840]  article at about 6 a.m. Central this morning we've actually discovered
[01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:30.800]  they're deleting pro gun accounts now so that's another breaking news story that
[01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:34.120]  I've been so busy I discovered that at about 9 a.m. this morning and never even
[01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:38.040]  had time to call Paul to put him out of the story or to tell Kurt Nemo or our
[01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:40.960]  other writers about it it's just that that's just too much going on I mean
[01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:45.960]  it's just insane but an image posted the aftermath of the shootings that
[01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:49.760]  questioned whether a clumsy 20 year old autistic kid that had pulled off the
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:53.560]  murders of 26 people was deleted and the user's account hit with a three-day
[01:37:53.560 --> 01:38:01.200]  suspension yeah that was like we've had different pop folks announced they're
[01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:06.560]  gonna be on my show in their account gets suspended or completely shut down so
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:10.280]  that's the type of stuff that's going on I was informed the reason for this
[01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:14.480]  punishment was the result of a meme I had shared writes the editor of secrets
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:18.600]  of the Fed comm yeah Facebook a few months ago during the election that
[01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:24.440]  Navy SEAL group was putting out just an image it was a very conservative image
[01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:28.600]  and just showed the two dead Navy SEALs just their photos that had gone to help
[01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:32.680]  at the Benghazi attack with the ambassador even though Obama had ordered
[01:38:32.680 --> 01:38:36.040]  an eight-hour stand down so the al-Qaeda folks that ran security in the city
[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:40.600]  could carry out the killing and it said you know we help take out bin Laden
[01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:44.200]  going along with that story but then when we asked for help we didn't get any
[01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:50.440]  and they just deleted that and shut down their account they set up another one I
[01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:55.080]  mean this is run by a guy the owner that will the founder of Facebook who says
[01:38:55.080 --> 01:39:00.440]  that oh our users trust us they're dumb bleepers remember that and it's just
[01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:05.680]  sick Google and Facebook and and and Twitter's now censoring people more and
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:09.560]  more and yeah I'm on Twitter I'm on Facebook I kind of waited till late in
[01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:14.040]  the game to get on them so we've only got about a million likes on Facebook
[01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:18.600]  between our six or seven fan channels people gave us and we've got I don't
[01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:23.000]  know 130,000 or something on one of our Twitter accounts we got a couple other
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:27.080]  that again fans gave us I just started promoting them really the last year but
[01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:31.200]  almost when I'm promoting it I'm like okay I know I'm reaching some people
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:36.320]  through this but it can be taken away at any time but it doesn't matter we're
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:39.520]  still using it to get the word out but this is happening more and more yeah
[01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:45.960]  Facebook CEO admits to calling users dumb efforts Mark Zuckerberg admits the
[01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:50.160]  New Yorker profile that he mocked early Facebook users for trusting him with
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:54.320]  their personal information remember Google said don't be evil and smith
[01:39:54.320 --> 01:40:00.680]  promised you know the founder that I'll never spy on you I'll never have your
[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:04.600]  data now he says better not do something you don't want us knowing about yeah
[01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:09.800]  we're taking all the data and we had a video out of him at Bilderberg two years
[01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:13.160]  ago a year and a half ago in Switzerland they shut that down for a while so that
[01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:17.160]  was outrage and then YouTube that's owned by Google put it back up this is the
[01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:21.360]  type of stuff we're dealing with with state-run Internet and believe me
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:26.240]  Google is state-run Google was set up by the CIA in QTEL we broke that like eight
[01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:32.720]  years ago people went crazy when we had that CIA agent on steel it's the name
[01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:38.560]  David Steele and man he was like wow I've never had such heat off this sorry
[01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:43.480]  can't come back on your show we should ask that guy back on the show again the
[01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:46.680]  point is later that all came out that that was all true and now they're at
[01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:52.440]  NASA bases Google is and people ask well why do you use Google I mean we use it
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:56.400]  and admit it's a globalist combine that it's a globalist operation all right
[01:40:56.400 --> 01:41:00.320]  let's do this let's open the phones up I know you're chomping at the bit to talk
[01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:03.600]  about everything that's been discussed on the second amendment let you heard
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:07.160]  Larry Pratt he says yes this appears to be the greatest assault on guns we've
[01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:13.120]  ever seen folks I saw them energizing building up getting ready the
[01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:18.760]  preparations the test cases the White House didn't ship 20,000 guns to
[01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:23.280]  Mexico and illegal hanging aids because they wanted to play you know games they
[01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:28.200]  did that to blame the second amendment that came out they mean business and the
[01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:34.160]  Republicans are gonna cave on taxes and your guns and on open borders you know
[01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:39.560]  why because it's what the globalist point Obama is a puppet as much as I
[01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:44.200]  dislike him as unsavory as he is they're supposed to be the ones getting it all
[01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:48.480]  done for the globalist making collectivism and tyranny look cool he can
[01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:52.720]  smart bomb people all day and kill kids and it's sexy the liberals man he's a
[01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:59.480]  tough liberal he's a big murderer that you know they like that so so the
[01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:04.000]  Democrats are bad news they're the open tip of the spear but the Republicans
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:08.080]  let me give you the newsflash here Ron Paul's leave in Congress there's some
[01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:17.960]  people in there like Gohmert and people like Jones and people like Amash there
[01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:21.960]  are some good members maybe a couple dozen in the house there's a couple
[01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:27.760]  good senators who will not compromise on the second amendment but I mean look
[01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:31.800]  even Rand Paul is a smart guy I've known him for 14 years I made some phone
[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:34.880]  calls and found out he kind of got snookered on it they came out two weeks
[01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:41.600]  ago and said oh NDA just got shot down the indefinite detention provision but
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:48.680]  the bill as all the big you know groups went and analyzed it all the big
[01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:51.960]  foundations went and analyze it the law groups the constitutional lawyers all
[01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:57.120]  came out Lou Rockwell calm came out and it says clearly we can't indefinite
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:43:04.360]  detention you unless already in law well it's in law from NDA a December 31st 2011
[01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:10.680]  signed by Obama it's more lawyer tricks all day but Obama his people write the
[01:43:10.680 --> 01:43:14.120]  NDA but then he says he's against it and he wants it changed but then it turns
[01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:17.560]  out the letters behind the scenes are don't change this I'm just doing this
[01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:22.240]  so opposition dies and he says don't worry I won't sign it I know I tell the
[01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:26.640]  story every day it's just so diabolical don't worry I won't sign it so don't
[01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:30.920]  oppose it let it pass and I'm folks he's gonna sign it no he's not you right
[01:43:30.920 --> 01:43:36.280]  wing sons that are precious Obama wouldn't do that then he signs it they're
[01:43:36.280 --> 01:43:39.280]  like well I guess he needs to be able to arrest you and disappear you right
[01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:50.000]  wingers you know this is the type of stuff that we see happen over and over
[01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:59.680]  and over and over and over and over again and it's so frustrating to sit here
[01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:03.120]  because the media will put out a narrative a big hype narrative and it
[01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:07.600]  never lasts long like Coney 2012 then it comes out it's warmongering invasion
[01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:10.800]  propaganda we were confirmed right on that wasn't hard to confirm it it was
[01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:16.680]  all globalist funded anything Oprah Winfrey's involved in this globalist
[01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:21.000]  funded to I mean she's in I'm gonna cover this next hour in in meetings with
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:28.720]  top globalist on how to reduce population and it just makes me sick to sit
[01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:35.000]  here and watch all of this unfold toll free number to join us 800-259-9231
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:46.320]  800-259-9231 this is the all-out attack and all over the country again for two
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:49.480]  years and we've done special reports on this we ought to re-air it tonight on
[01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:54.360]  the Natalie news for two years after Jaws became the number one moving in
[01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:58.880]  history of that time worldwide from Australia to the United States from
[01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:06.160]  England to the south of France some beaches saw 70 plus percent reductions
[01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:10.040]  in people coming period they were so scared and most people a lifeguard said
[01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:13.240]  wouldn't go in the water because they thought the mechanical shark was in
[01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:18.400]  there waiting for them this is mind-controlled we have a childlike
[01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:25.080]  public where you know sometimes you know your three-year-old gets off and
[01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:27.920]  wanders off in a restaurant out and you know you go hey honey there's bad men
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:31.680]  that might get you they don't listen but if you tell it to him in a fairy tale
[01:45:31.680 --> 01:45:35.680]  that a witch might you know there's witches they mean you monsters of course
[01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:39.960]  I won't do that but some parents do it's what old wives tales fairy tales are
[01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:43.440]  about is so your kids listen you got to put that little bit of fear into them
[01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:47.400]  or the real bad people will get them well the globalist basically use fairy
[01:45:47.400 --> 01:45:50.720]  tales like there's a man waiting to kill everybody at your school today they're
[01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:55.200]  everywhere it's an epidemic it's flat in the last 20 years I just showed you FBI
[01:45:55.200 --> 01:46:01.800]  unified crime statistics that just came out last week showing massive violent
[01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:07.320]  crime reduction now petty crime stealing copper wiring get it going in an open
[01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:11.280]  garage stealing bikes knocking out your window at the park stealing your purse if
[01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:18.360]  you don't hide it that is off the chart criminals in this depression I've got
[01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:22.500]  the numbers right here they are I mean I think they said there's been like a
[01:46:22.500 --> 01:46:26.760]  five-fold increase last few years in Austin in in in petty crime I mean
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:30.880]  it's bad because the criminals they don't invade your house now they don't
[01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:34.160]  even try to carjack you now they don't mess with you on the police to have
[01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:37.320]  muggings down on the hike and bike trail back on the city had half the
[01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:41.260]  population it has today cities doubled the last 15 years those muggings all
[01:46:41.260 --> 01:46:50.200]  the time not anymore people are running with concealed carry 25s and 32s so
[01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:55.080]  criminals except if you're in big cities where they've taken the guns they are
[01:46:55.080 --> 01:47:01.320]  not I mean violent crime is way down because store owners are packing women
[01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:04.720]  are packing single women are packing I mean here are the crime statistics
[01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:12.640]  right here unified violent crime offense figure just total this is 2007 to 2011
[01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:15.960]  the numbers always come out a year late we've got trends for this year as well
[01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:21.400]  as continuing massive massive look at that look at that percentage what is
[01:47:21.400 --> 01:47:27.320]  that a that's over I wanted yes with the 20% reduction and if you look at it from
[01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:32.840]  1980 man I remember 1980 living in Dallas when they were having some days
[01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:37.280]  25 murders Dallas used to have more murders than Chicago and New York in
[01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:43.560]  mind but it was gangbangers it was a gang war but the gangbangers just killed
[01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:46.760]  all of each other and I think that's terrible but you know the point is is
[01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:54.640]  that is that crime is literally plunging violent crime now people stealing your
[01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:58.840]  credit card numbers off the chart people stealing your purse when you're at the
[01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:01.760]  restaurant when you go to the bathroom off the chart so you know that's why
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:05.600]  the police are out there saying rightfully show lock your stuff in the
[01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:10.640]  trunk take it in with you you drive in I drove into Barton Creek Mall where
[01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:13.680]  they're having the scare right now just last week because I wanted to get some
[01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:17.600]  legos for Christmas all my son's out there he's here when he's getting for
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:24.720]  Christmas and he comes to work with us at least once a week and they have big
[01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:27.800]  signs up saying take your belongings in because they're just knocking windows out
[01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:31.520]  and I don't need the police to tell me that if I pull up to a park and see
[01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:36.640]  broken glass in every slot I just I just don't go to that park if I'd pull up to
[01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:42.680]  the mall and I just see glass all over the ground which I'm seeing I know I
[01:48:42.680 --> 01:48:47.160]  don't need the police to tell me but see the general public is not in a police
[01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:53.600]  mindset and I think all of us should get into that mindset of looking around not
[01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:57.680]  just being chumps but side issue the criminals are scared to death folks they
[01:48:57.680 --> 01:49:02.060]  know you're buying guns and the collectivists are about to lose guncultures
[01:49:02.060 --> 01:49:05.880]  are all the top shows hunting is all the top shows women are out buying guns
[01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:09.880]  the guncultures taking over they're panicking throwing everything they've
[01:49:09.880 --> 01:49:13.440]  got at this they probably staged it I mean my gut is they staged it if they
[01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:18.160]  stage fast and furious if they stage all this other stuff they could have
[01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:22.720]  staged this I don't know they're certainly using it though let's go to Bob
[01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:30.960]  in Virginia you're on the air sir go ahead hey there Alex great job I have
[01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:37.560]  two points that I want to make but in the micro in the macro in the micro this
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:45.520]  this whole gun thing is absolutely and positively the result of these people
[01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:50.880]  being afraid of what will happen to them if the majority of the people in this
[01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:56.560]  country find out what they've done to us no no I I spent an hour first hour
[01:49:56.560 --> 01:50:00.880]  babbling and giving this factoid that factoid just trying to say that yeah
[01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:04.760]  real simple the criminal elite have committed millions of crimes they're
[01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:08.280]  bad people they know we're waking up they're desperate to put a police state
[01:50:08.280 --> 01:50:13.560]  in and take our guns yes that's it hammering that point because the big
[01:50:13.560 --> 01:50:19.360]  point and the thing that makes me pessimistic about us ever having a chance
[01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:24.280]  to take this country by it's a federal reserve the activist Federal Reserve we
[01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:28.400]  know they made those moves before the election to get Obama elected of course
[01:50:28.400 --> 01:50:33.200]  we know the the election was a fraud to begin with but the bottom line is they
[01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:38.880]  print the money it's fraudulent they steal our labor and what I the only thing
[01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:42.320]  the only hope that I have left I mean I have watched the Federal Reserve I have

[01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:25.280]  the fellow reserve yeah America has just got to wake up to the fact that we've
[01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:30.760]  been overtaken by social engineers that want to disarm us I mean when you sit
[01:54:30.760 --> 01:54:35.440]  here you know these are authoritarian liars who've killed the last few years
[01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:39.760]  tens of thousands of children alone in drone attacks on eight countries
[01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:45.200]  illegally and then he's up there fake crying saying we've got to do something
[01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:51.040]  and not let this happen again listen there's 315 million people 60 plus million
[01:54:51.040 --> 01:54:57.440]  of them on suicide murder pills called SSRIs it's on the insert it makes you do
[01:54:57.440 --> 01:55:04.360]  that statistically every time there's a senseless murder every time that's what
[01:55:04.360 --> 01:55:10.280]  did it never a discussion about that though it's that I've got guns and that
[01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:14.640]  I'm empowered and I'm strong and I'm not domesticated the nanny state wants our
[01:55:14.640 --> 01:55:18.360]  guns and if they get them they win so teach everybody you know how to use
[01:55:18.360 --> 01:55:25.760]  guns it is that empowerment that is going to destroy the globalist because
[01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:28.720]  see they can't totally smash and bring the country down and break up the
[01:55:28.720 --> 01:55:32.880]  families and force inoculate and have their forced labor camps and national
[01:55:32.880 --> 01:55:36.880]  compulsory service Rahm Emanuel's called for unless they've taken the guns
[01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:42.440]  it's so elementary and and a lot of the collectivist it's like a football game
[01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:44.880]  that they're with the government you're not and they're tough and you're weak
[01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:49.400]  just keep exposing these zombies keep getting in their face when they think
[01:55:49.400 --> 01:55:52.840]  they have the moral high ground they're calling you a murderer and a child
[01:55:52.840 --> 01:55:56.840]  killer and a clan member remember these are people living off government checks
[01:55:56.840 --> 01:56:02.280]  in every case who really have low self images and hate you as a productive
[01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:06.360]  person and they hate you because you know how to use a gun they hate you
[01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:10.640]  because you're a man or a woman who's strong and they they're threatened by
[01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:18.120]  that okay let's go to your calls let's talk to Rick listening on XM sir you're
[01:56:18.120 --> 01:56:21.800]  on the air from Virginia go ahead
[01:56:21.800 --> 01:56:27.200]  saying something there's some relationship between the killer in Aurora and
[01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:30.920]  the last killer in Connecticut their dad they worked in banks and they were
[01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:35.240]  gonna testify do you hear anything about that or both of them did both of them
[01:56:35.240 --> 01:56:43.160]  did work in in high finance and then there was another case with that
[01:56:43.160 --> 01:56:49.800]  executive NBC executive that ran the story and then the nanny within hours
[01:56:49.800 --> 01:56:53.880]  kills the kids I mean I don't know those are coincidences and I don't really go
[01:56:53.880 --> 01:57:00.440]  with those on the Aurora shooter I mean he was in a DARPA mind control program
[01:57:00.440 --> 01:57:05.600]  in a brain interface where machines take over the brain he was a child prodigy
[01:57:05.600 --> 01:57:09.680]  out of out of high school brought in you know years later a graduate student and
[01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:15.440]  had a psych warfare psychiatrist from the Air Force who was a high level
[01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:20.240]  commander of whole bases assigned to him and they knew what he was gonna do in
[01:57:20.240 --> 01:57:24.520]  his notebook and basically let him do it and then you've got all the other
[01:57:24.520 --> 01:57:29.160]  evidence that I believe was a mind control operation we don't have enough
[01:57:29.160 --> 01:57:33.080]  evidence on this other case so we don't know but we sure know they're going
[01:57:33.080 --> 01:57:38.400]  whole log with it did you know in the week leading up to this every show on
[01:57:38.400 --> 01:57:44.680]  the globalist media was doing anti-gun on CNN MSNBC no I didn't know that yeah
[01:57:44.680 --> 01:57:49.040]  they were well it's thought you know I was listening to one of the liberals

[01:57:53.960 --> 01:57:58.800]  got stacks of articles they say the NRA must be banned and gun owners must be
[01:57:58.800 --> 01:58:04.880]  arrested they're now on MSNBC and CNN saying let's just get rid of all guns
[01:58:04.880 --> 01:58:08.760]  of course they mean that the citizens have no no these are authoritarians who
[01:58:08.760 --> 01:58:14.080]  were scared I mean their state run no one hardly watches them they live off
[01:58:14.080 --> 01:58:17.200]  banker bailout money the big banks that own them and they get stimulus money
[01:58:17.200 --> 01:58:22.440]  these are horrible state run foreign banker representatives that's why most

[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:29.320]  others that are holding but if you're watching on TV I want to show you
[02:00:29.320 --> 02:00:33.280]  something here and I'll describe it for radio listeners you go to one of our
[02:00:33.280 --> 02:00:38.920]  YouTube channels with 255 million views there you can see one of the latest
[02:00:38.920 --> 02:00:45.400]  videos we did last Friday that drudgereport.com link to and I've really
[02:00:45.400 --> 02:00:48.600]  learned how YouTube works is one of our important outreaches to the general
[02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:54.320]  public and so notice I've noticed for a couple days it said 511,000 we can punch
[02:00:54.320 --> 02:01:00.880]  it up on screen it said 511,000 views now I've watched other videos of
[02:01:00.880 --> 02:01:07.240]  entertainment and stuff where once something gets up to 300 400 500,000
[02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:11.880]  views and I'm currently watching this it's not just like I'm saying YouTube is
[02:01:11.880 --> 02:01:19.880]  doing this but really it's system-wide that's I ran out of water I'm dying I'm
[02:01:19.880 --> 02:01:23.560]  gonna be able to continue my voice just went out thanks and that's why I was I
[02:01:23.560 --> 02:01:26.440]  was like grimacing and they thought I meant put the camera back on me no
[02:01:26.440 --> 02:01:29.240]  that's not what I meant thanks I gotta put a water cooler in here that's what's
[02:01:29.240 --> 02:01:33.800]  happening is around the water sometimes my voice just cracks especially when
[02:01:33.800 --> 02:01:37.080]  there's allergies this time of year okay trying to regroup get back to what I was
[02:01:37.080 --> 02:01:43.960]  saying here on screen I'm showing the YouTube channel with a particular video
[02:01:43.960 --> 02:01:50.240]  that says 511,000 views now currently I went and tracked other viral videos that
[02:01:50.240 --> 02:01:54.800]  have similar similar views that are updating every few hours with with the
[02:01:54.800 --> 02:01:59.960]  number of viewers this has said 511,000 views since yesterday morning other
[02:01:59.960 --> 02:02:05.760]  videos on YouTube are not stuck like this I've been monitoring them okay if I
[02:02:05.760 --> 02:02:10.080]  take but but let me show you something that will get past their cashing and
[02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:13.960]  show that this is something unique to my channel because you can go to other
[02:02:13.960 --> 02:02:18.920]  videos and see for yourself this is not happening okay they are updating I put in
[02:02:18.920 --> 02:02:24.120]  the headline into YouTube itself and search it and it will show you the real
[02:02:24.120 --> 02:02:34.280]  view count 631,705 but I've learned that when you go to their front page when
[02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:40.120]  the videos displaying they will hold us back they've got some program patch on
[02:02:40.120 --> 02:02:44.520]  there to where we don't get our views till later so that we won't go to the
[02:02:44.520 --> 02:02:51.000]  front page so it's real views are 631,000 and again I've talked to IT
[02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:55.840]  people this is not a cashing issue that this is showing you you know something
[02:02:55.840 --> 02:03:00.760]  that's clear just because it's it's it's deeper into their servers or an area
[02:03:00.760 --> 02:03:05.480]  updating more often other videos that are similarly viral are updating every
[02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:10.600]  few hours it's my channel that's why we've noticed that with this channel
[02:03:10.600 --> 02:03:15.320]  other people grab our videos that they don't even have hardly any subscribers
[02:03:15.320 --> 02:03:19.080]  you know we got 300 something thousand subscribers on the channel channels that
[02:03:19.080 --> 02:03:23.440]  have maybe 10,000 subscribers will get more views copying our videos than our
[02:03:23.440 --> 02:03:29.600]  site and will update quicker and that's because there's censorship going on and
[02:03:29.600 --> 02:03:33.920]  of course we've had them ban us and knocked down the Obama deception and you
[02:03:33.920 --> 02:03:40.240]  know the overtly censorous but but but now this is what they're doing they are
[02:03:40.240 --> 02:03:47.920]  holding back this video Obama caught fake crying we've also gone on separate
[02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:52.680]  computer networks and voted the video up and then hit refresh and it doesn't have
[02:03:52.680 --> 02:03:57.160]  the thumbs up go up but then we've gone another network and voted down and it
[02:03:57.160 --> 02:04:02.640]  instantly shows a down vote so they're also skewing viral videos that we have

[02:12:52.320 --> 02:12:58.240]  on the air watching via prisonplanet.tv go ahead sir hi Alex two quick things
[02:12:58.240 --> 02:13:03.640]  before Sandy Hook first of all I was an election judge and not even 15 minutes
[02:13:03.640 --> 02:13:07.720]  after I left the polling place to take my votes back they were already staying
[02:13:07.720 --> 02:13:17.160]  Illinois went to Obama and also I have a good reason to take dreams from my real
[02:13:17.160 --> 02:13:23.960]  father over to somebody I know tomorrow in another town and then I wanted to
[02:13:23.960 --> 02:13:30.280]  ask you about Sandy Hook it's just amazing to me that somebody's pointing
[02:13:30.280 --> 02:13:37.560]  to it in the very movie that also has the other the Dark Knight movie well you
[02:13:37.560 --> 02:13:41.560]  know we actually made a video I haven't tooted my horn but I believe the
[02:13:41.560 --> 02:13:46.280]  headline is secrets of the Dark Knight leaked we should have the nightly news
[02:13:46.280 --> 02:13:51.560]  tonight I point out that I believe it has subliminals in it by watching it that
[02:13:51.560 --> 02:13:56.640]  would program people to engage in mass shootings and that gets into the some of
[02:13:56.640 --> 02:14:00.240]  the science of subliminals that's actually taught at graduate level and
[02:14:00.240 --> 02:14:08.480]  PhD level and I actually forgot that well well I've said all three of the films
[02:14:08.480 --> 02:14:13.960]  have been programming both over and covert and they admit violent video
[02:14:13.960 --> 02:14:20.400]  games our first-person training aids so troops will kill people in an
[02:14:20.400 --> 02:14:23.120]  unfeeling way that's how doom and all these other games got invented it's
[02:14:23.120 --> 02:14:28.760]  just a fact so I mean we're living under mind control the entire culture is
[02:14:28.760 --> 02:14:34.160]  mind control look when jaws came out for two years people wouldn't go in the
[02:14:34.160 --> 02:14:38.760]  water and almost killed the beachside tourist industry just look it up folks
[02:14:38.760 --> 02:14:43.480]  the news articles are scanned online from the 70s when it come out like 76 or
[02:14:43.480 --> 02:14:50.240]  something the point is that's mind control people won't swim most my family
[02:14:50.240 --> 02:14:53.960]  won't go out in the ocean or in the Caribbean won't go a lot of people I
[02:14:53.960 --> 02:14:58.320]  know won't go swimming because they're scared of sharks I mean you've got a
[02:14:58.320 --> 02:15:04.640]  better chance of being bitten by a unicorn I mean it's incredible it is
[02:15:04.640 --> 02:15:08.760]  incredible how rare it is but they're scared same thing with these guns
[02:15:08.760 --> 02:15:13.320]  thousands get struck by lightning every year hundreds die guys you type in a
[02:15:13.320 --> 02:15:16.640]  number of lightning strike deaths a year in the US I want to pull up those
[02:15:16.640 --> 02:15:20.640]  actual numbers thanks my point is I've seen them before but I'm going off
[02:15:20.640 --> 02:15:25.000]  memory dear kill more than mass shootings they know this but it doesn't
[02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:30.120]  matter because now people dropping their kids off are like oh my gosh people are
[02:15:30.120 --> 02:15:33.960]  gonna come kill my kids here take America's guns when that's a zone where
[02:15:33.960 --> 02:15:38.000]  they've taken the guns anything else well you know before I started listening
[02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:44.960]  to you my wife had pointed out to me about Batman 2 and how they were going
[02:15:44.960 --> 02:15:49.680]  to get to us through the TV and now you talk about flicker eight and
[02:15:49.680 --> 02:15:54.400]  everything else it's just you know these things are more than coincidental I
[02:15:54.400 --> 02:16:00.280]  believe that whoever produced that Dark Knight movie ought to be questioned as
[02:16:00.280 --> 02:16:06.360]  to why Sandy Hooks getting pointed to you know what's crazy done yeah Aurora's
[02:16:06.360 --> 02:16:09.360]  in it too yeah they talk about Aurora you know what just blew me away and
[02:16:09.360 --> 02:16:15.880]  thanks for the call it just hit me that I talked about on the show about
[02:16:15.880 --> 02:16:20.360]  subliminals and mass shootings and bombings that's I think I did it some
[02:16:20.360 --> 02:16:24.480]  in the video but mainly on the show and I didn't even talk about how I predicted
[02:16:24.480 --> 02:16:32.600]  that when the shooting happened I just I just remembered I predicted it all see
[02:16:32.600 --> 02:16:41.600]  I can't even I can't even keep track of this this is reported lightning deaths per
[02:16:41.600 --> 02:16:55.880]  per state from 1998 to 2008 Florida 74 deaths Texas 28 Colorado 27 Georgia 23

[02:17:03.080 --> 02:17:05.880]  I'm sorry I was it's even worse than I was reading the wrong but it's a high
[02:17:05.880 --> 02:17:09.720]  number obviously let's go back to your calls rich in New York thanks for
[02:17:09.720 --> 02:17:15.000]  holding sir go ahead hey Alex God bless your brother hey real quick this is
[02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.880]  definitely a smoke screen for holder you probably will never hear another thing
[02:17:17.880 --> 02:17:21.760]  about the gun running operation as long as this thing is alive but more
[02:17:21.760 --> 02:17:25.000]  importantly what I wanted to bring to your attention the daily news today in
[02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:29.560]  New York has a 10 first 10 pages of the Daily News is a full-out assault on the
[02:17:29.560 --> 02:17:34.560]  MRA and on guns basically the front page has blood on your hands to Washington
[02:17:34.560 --> 02:17:39.680]  as burials begin it's time to DC to act and you got Joe Starborough in the first
[02:17:39.680 --> 02:17:43.680]  page my gun belief had died with all the kids and he basically goes off to say
[02:17:43.680 --> 02:17:46.840]  that the bill rights doesn't guarantee gun manufacturers the absolute right to
[02:17:46.840 --> 02:17:50.560]  sell military-style weapons to anybody oh yeah no no I saw the article I've
[02:17:50.560 --> 02:17:55.560]  actually got some of the sub articles here in my stack and yeah no no they're
[02:17:55.560 --> 02:18:00.800]  always gonna have that defector you know I was pro-gun but I'm not now I mean he
[02:18:00.800 --> 02:18:06.640]  works for MSNBC I mean that's state-run media go ahead right well the
[02:18:06.640 --> 02:18:09.600]  biggest thing that they have in here that that you know these see they're
[02:18:09.600 --> 02:18:14.920]  really going for the jugular they have a cutout petition and you can go online
[02:18:14.920 --> 02:18:19.760]  basically sign our assault weapons ban petition 34 Americans that killed every
[02:18:19.760 --> 02:18:23.680]  day by firearms the total killed in just six months is equal to all American
[02:18:23.680 --> 02:18:28.520]  combat deaths over the entire length of the Iraq and that can stand wars basically

[02:24:09.600 --> 02:24:13.320]  they want to start a civil war they know America is waking up to them that's
[02:24:13.320 --> 02:24:16.680]  why they've got staged elections with staged candidates it's why they're
[02:24:16.680 --> 02:24:20.960]  gutting everything they can that's why they're bankrupting the nation shipping
[02:24:20.960 --> 02:24:25.600]  the jobs overseas paying to ship General Motors to China they are just gutting
[02:24:25.600 --> 02:24:30.280]  this country it's what oligarchs do and they hate the fact you're armed and that
[02:24:30.280 --> 02:24:34.400]  people know there's been a takeover so everybody's out there getting guns and
[02:24:34.400 --> 02:24:40.080]  getting ready they hate preppers and they're trying to say the new Al Qaeda is
[02:24:40.080 --> 02:24:44.680]  libertarians and veterans and the people now found out about that the public now
[02:24:44.680 --> 02:24:49.200]  knows the government runs Al Qaeda everything's coming true for people and
[02:24:49.200 --> 02:24:52.000]  they're desperately trying to run around and dangle dead kids in front of us
[02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:55.480]  saying turn your guns in when the people running our government are a bunch of
[02:24:55.480 --> 02:24:59.600]  mass murdering control freaks running Al Qaeda worldwide to take over countries
[02:24:59.600 --> 02:25:04.960]  they could care less about those kids these are power freak ghouls Danny in
[02:25:04.960 --> 02:25:10.160]  California you're on the air go ahead yes hi Alex I'm a big fan been listening
[02:25:10.160 --> 02:25:14.560]  for about a year now and I wanted to get the guns to talk about guns but I
[02:25:14.560 --> 02:25:18.480]  wanted to ask you something before that do you know anything about this
[02:25:18.480 --> 02:25:24.120]  supposed Chinese submarine that was off the coast of Long Beach in like 2010
[02:25:24.120 --> 02:25:28.640]  that fired a missile and then they said that it might be a plane contrail but
[02:25:28.640 --> 02:25:32.400]  then there are other people who said yes yes a bunch of NASA and former
[02:25:32.400 --> 02:25:36.960]  engineers on ICBM said it was a submarine launch to even know the name of the
[02:25:36.960 --> 02:25:41.600]  missile and it was China basically menacing the west coast and a message
[02:25:41.600 --> 02:25:46.480]  to the west right I heard because we dropped them or they dropped us down in
[02:25:46.480 --> 02:25:49.560]  credit and we got angry we went over there they did the same thing to us they
[02:25:49.560 --> 02:25:54.920]  popped up over here yep no that's what happened they told the public they told
[02:25:54.920 --> 02:25:58.040]  the public it was nothing and so the public believed it was a condensation
[02:25:58.040 --> 02:26:01.240]  trail they could have told them it was a pixie elf or something and the public
[02:26:01.240 --> 02:26:04.040]  would have believed it and stuck their thumb in their mouth and began sucking
[02:26:04.040 --> 02:26:08.160]  on it they if the government handed out cyanide pills 30% of the public would
[02:26:08.160 --> 02:26:12.440]  take them and die with pleasure but again just cuz 30 40% or mined them the
[02:26:12.440 --> 02:26:17.360]  robots doesn't mean all of us get to be slaves go ahead right exactly no I
[02:26:17.360 --> 02:26:21.520]  totally agree but what I was gonna say was you're talking about gun control and
[02:26:21.520 --> 02:26:25.400]  all this and you're saying that NATO might have a UN arms treaty or something
[02:26:25.400 --> 02:26:29.680]  like that but also that Mayor Bloomberg was saying that he wants Obama to use
[02:26:29.680 --> 02:26:34.040]  executive power to take away our gun rights are sort of you know limit or
[02:26:34.040 --> 02:26:38.360]  strip away our second amendment I think it's you know preposterous I think it's
[02:26:38.360 --> 02:26:43.240]  it's really scary by the way monitoring talk radio even conservative shows this
[02:26:43.240 --> 02:26:48.360]  morning a couple national a couple local they were all going well I guess
[02:26:48.360 --> 02:26:53.840]  Obama may you know may take them from us yeah and and so the public doesn't
[02:26:53.840 --> 02:26:58.120]  even get when they're reporting that that's illegal you know the president
[02:26:58.120 --> 02:27:02.680]  isn't even over the states much less Congress and the courts he can't just
[02:27:02.680 --> 02:27:06.760]  say he's gonna ban our guns but you know what he's already been doing it
[02:27:06.760 --> 02:27:12.440]  banning importation banning manufacture banning this banning that and no
[02:27:12.440 --> 02:27:16.800]  president has signed more executive orders no president because it's the time
[02:27:16.800 --> 02:27:22.240]  it as much as it's fun to hate Obama it's that the globalist interest are
[02:27:22.240 --> 02:27:27.280]  making their move worldwide folks they've signed us on to impossible to pay
[02:27:27.280 --> 02:27:31.160]  derivatives they're going to bring us into a total collapse and they want to
[02:27:31.160 --> 02:27:35.880]  be able to go around and arrest whoever they want saying you have illegal guns
[02:27:35.880 --> 02:27:40.280]  and drag you off they're now saying the racist and the terrorist are the gun
[02:27:40.280 --> 02:27:45.600]  owners they're now demonizing us with rhetoric stronger than the Nazis used
[02:27:45.600 --> 02:27:52.880]  against the Jews stronger than the Soviets used against the white Russians and
[02:27:52.880 --> 02:27:56.960]  no folks all the Russians were white or most of them some were Asian in the
[02:27:56.960 --> 02:28:00.800]  east for people they're ignorant I say white slavery they go what about black
[02:28:00.800 --> 02:28:06.720]  slavery white slavery just means sex slavery for new listeners and to
[02:28:06.720 --> 02:28:09.800]  expand on that I always get into a history lesson what was the original
[02:28:09.800 --> 02:28:13.680]  point I was getting into oh oh oh white Russians were loyal to the czars and
[02:28:13.680 --> 02:28:16.840]  nothing to do with race thank you for the call sir great points let's talk to
[02:28:16.840 --> 02:28:31.920]  Rick in California as well go ahead sir well he's back to get on air you know

[02:28:42.200 --> 02:28:46.000]  whole thing with these teachers you know I love Jesse's idea about you know
[02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:52.560]  having the having deputized guys working for the janitors but I still think the
[02:28:52.560 --> 02:28:57.920]  teachers the way we should be doing this is to you know what the patients to get
[02:28:57.920 --> 02:29:02.800]  teachers to be able to carry and it's an opt-in program but see that six is the
[02:29:02.800 --> 02:29:06.840]  the the already very rare problem it's still a problem they don't want to fix
[02:29:06.840 --> 02:29:11.800]  it they want to take our guns and tell us we killed those kids they're saying
[02:29:11.800 --> 02:29:17.160]  gun owners you killed those kids gun manufacturers you killed those kids not
[02:29:17.160 --> 02:29:22.440]  the criminal article after article says police are now looking at ar-15s
[02:29:22.440 --> 02:29:28.480]  because the ar-15 killed the kids no it didn't if a crazy man in a crowd runs

[02:32:53.640 --> 02:33:09.280]  comm forward slash Alex the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex
[02:33:09.280 --> 02:33:25.360]  Jones show
[02:33:25.360 --> 02:33:37.760]  ladies and gentlemen we are joined our representative Walter B. Jones and he
[02:33:37.760 --> 02:33:46.160]  joins us from his seat there in the Carolinas and he is probably one of the
[02:33:46.160 --> 02:33:54.800]  best lawmakers we have in Congress and certainly the best out of North Carolina
[02:33:54.800 --> 02:34:02.000]  I wanted to get him on a few days ago about the letter that they have sent to
[02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:06.120]  President Obama that we're going to show you here in a moment and we're going to
[02:34:06.120 --> 02:34:11.480]  cover that dealing with the fact that now there's an unauthorized war in Syria
[02:34:11.480 --> 02:34:15.480]  that even the New York Times admitted to Sundays ago our government's funding
[02:34:15.480 --> 02:34:20.640]  al-Qaeda it's just amazing how to attack Syria so lawless so criminal so evil
[02:34:20.640 --> 02:34:23.760]  we're going to get to that because this is important news and there's been a
[02:34:23.760 --> 02:34:27.960]  blackout on it the system doesn't want the people to debate this or the drones
[02:34:27.960 --> 02:34:31.800]  Obama has blowing little kids up in eight different countries he doesn't cry
[02:34:31.800 --> 02:34:35.800]  about those or the thousands killed in Mexico hundreds of them children when
[02:34:35.800 --> 02:34:40.160]  they ship guns into Mexico but the congressman put out a letter saying
[02:34:40.160 --> 02:34:45.440]  Congress should not debate this and Congressmen should not get into this
[02:34:45.440 --> 02:34:50.760]  until the last child's been buried out of respect to the family unfortunately a
[02:34:50.760 --> 02:34:55.720]  lot of the Democrats are running around just saying ban guns period I've never
[02:34:55.720 --> 02:34:59.520]  seen such an assault on the Second Amendment because they know we've been
[02:34:59.520 --> 02:35:02.680]  winning court cases and the Second Amendment culture is growing so
[02:35:02.680 --> 02:35:05.520]  Congressman I understand your letter saying you don't want to get into this
[02:35:05.520 --> 02:35:10.480]  but the Democrats aren't listening what can you say about the Second Amendment
[02:35:10.480 --> 02:35:15.280]  and where it stands because they are saying the NRA murdered these children
[02:35:15.280 --> 02:35:20.360]  they're saying all gun owners are responsible and Fox Sports CNN they're
[02:35:20.360 --> 02:35:24.560]  now a new talking point they're saying that gun owners are secretly clan
[02:35:24.560 --> 02:35:28.680]  members I'm sure you've seen that it has no connection to reality it's like
[02:35:28.680 --> 02:35:33.840]  saying if you like green beans you are a child molester it just it is the most
[02:35:33.840 --> 02:35:37.920]  base of propaganda kind of like saying you know you're a bad man you know you're
[02:35:37.920 --> 02:35:43.080]  the devil but do you have any idea just separate from the children in the
[02:35:43.080 --> 02:35:47.640]  shooting because I know you said you're not gonna talk about that the why things
[02:35:47.640 --> 02:35:52.560]  are why the rhetoric is getting so bizarre that to someone who's tries to
[02:35:52.560 --> 02:35:58.360]  be informed it seems like an absurdist Kurt Vonnegut novel well Alex let me say
[02:35:58.360 --> 02:36:03.480]  thank you for this opportunity at first I would say that I have been and will be
[02:36:03.480 --> 02:36:07.760]  as long as I'm a member of the United States Congress a strong supporter of
[02:36:07.760 --> 02:36:13.480]  the rights of a law-abiding citizen to have his second amendment rights
[02:36:13.480 --> 02:36:19.440]  protected I do not agree with these extremists that want to say we need to
[02:36:19.440 --> 02:36:23.240]  debate this today we need to debate this tomorrow that's why I took the position
[02:36:23.240 --> 02:36:28.320]  that you just may reference to until the last child is buried I don't think
[02:36:28.320 --> 02:36:33.320]  the Congress left or right should be debating this in Washington and I don't
[02:36:33.320 --> 02:36:38.320]  think we will be I think the battle will start next year in 2013 and that's when
[02:36:38.320 --> 02:36:42.720]  we all need to roll up our sleeves and fight to protect the second amendment
[02:36:42.720 --> 02:36:47.480]  rights of people of this country who live by the law I have never seen such
[02:36:47.480 --> 02:36:55.920]  shameful universal exploitation of these dead little children yeah I mean this is
[02:36:55.920 --> 02:37:00.360]  a victim disarmament anti-gun anti-American cult I don't know if
[02:37:00.360 --> 02:37:05.000]  you've been following CNN and MSNBC but I mean they're just they are saying gun
[02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:10.400]  owners are the scum of the earth period well Alex I do not watch those shows
[02:37:10.400 --> 02:37:14.760]  that often but I will say obviously because of the tragedy I've watched the
[02:37:14.760 --> 02:37:19.200]  shows more than than I normally would but I would say this I think all those
[02:37:19.200 --> 02:37:23.840]  reporters have not done the families the service they deserve and that's to have
[02:37:23.840 --> 02:37:29.160]  privacy and time to cry and to love each other and remember that little child
[02:37:29.160 --> 02:37:33.920]  that's been called to heaven so I don't listen to the to the left wing or the
[02:37:33.920 --> 02:37:38.640]  right wing TV shows because I don't want to hear it I want to see respect for the
[02:37:38.640 --> 02:37:42.880]  families whose children have been killed let's debate this issue of the second
[02:37:42.880 --> 02:37:47.240]  amendment well I agree with you I agree with you but separately they're always
[02:37:47.240 --> 02:37:50.840]  you know they're now saying having fantasized up to age three and abortions
[02:37:50.840 --> 02:37:55.640]  is a great thing I mean these children are only five years out of the womb right
[02:37:55.640 --> 02:38:02.920]  I mean I wish they would show the same supposed you know care that MSNBC's
[02:38:02.920 --> 02:38:06.120]  you've been showing over these poor little darlings I have small children it
[02:38:06.120 --> 02:38:11.600]  it really tears me up but I mean I wish they'd be concerned about the unborn
[02:38:11.600 --> 02:38:16.320]  well I'm with you on that I'm like you I'm very much pro-life and believe that
[02:38:16.320 --> 02:38:21.760]  the little seed that becomes a baby is in the womb before it's born is just
[02:38:21.760 --> 02:38:26.480]  as important as whatever happens on earth to young children or adults it's
[02:38:26.480 --> 02:38:30.760]  equal okay well listen Congressman Jones I know you came on representing
[02:38:30.760 --> 02:38:36.280]  North Carolina in the United States to get into a big tragedy you're trying
[02:38:36.280 --> 02:38:40.320]  to stop being any worse now here's your letter December 12th hey folks in here
[02:38:40.320 --> 02:38:44.400]  about this in the news did you get this out to everybody to the president of
[02:38:44.400 --> 02:38:48.800]  the United States President Barack Obama and would you like to read this
[02:38:48.800 --> 02:38:51.120]  letter congressman or would you like me to read it or would you like to talk
[02:38:51.120 --> 02:38:55.320]  about it I will be glad to you read the first paragraph and I'll read the
[02:38:55.320 --> 02:39:00.400]  second paragraph has that okay we'll do that right now it says dear President
[02:39:00.400 --> 02:39:04.920]  Barack Obama the White House Washington DC dear Mr. President we are
[02:39:04.920 --> 02:39:09.800]  writing to strongly urge you not to once again lead our nation into war
[02:39:09.800 --> 02:39:13.800]  without authorization from Congress the recent threat of consequences should
[02:39:13.800 --> 02:39:18.400]  Syria use chemical weapons is eerily reminiscent of the calls for war with
[02:39:18.400 --> 02:39:24.680]  Iraq to deal with their weapons of mass destruction and that's in quotes we
[02:39:24.680 --> 02:39:29.040]  would like to remind you that the power to declare war remains vested in the
[02:39:29.040 --> 02:39:34.120]  Congress no resolution from the United Nations or NATO can supersede the power
[02:39:34.120 --> 02:39:39.360]  carefully entrusted with representatives of the American people and the second
[02:39:39.360 --> 02:39:43.200]  paragraph Alex is if your administration believes committing American
[02:39:43.200 --> 02:39:48.080]  troops to Syria is essential the case must be permitted to be presented to
[02:39:48.080 --> 02:39:52.880]  Congress outside of an actual imminent attack on America the only precursor to
[02:39:52.880 --> 02:39:57.440]  war can be the authorization of Congress we call on you to abide by our
[02:39:57.440 --> 02:40:02.680]  Constitution and rely on our country's representatives to decide when war is
[02:40:02.680 --> 02:40:07.360]  necessary there's no greater responsibility to spend to send our
[02:40:07.360 --> 02:40:11.760]  young sons and daughters to war that responsibility remains with the United
[02:40:11.760 --> 02:40:17.840]  States Congress Alex is signed by myself by Ron Paul by Mo Brooks by Mike
[02:40:17.840 --> 02:40:22.960]  Michaud Democrat from Maine by Justin Dimash from Michigan and also Charlie
[02:40:22.960 --> 02:40:27.360]  Rangel from New York has signed this letter and we will send that this letter
[02:40:27.360 --> 02:40:31.480]  to the president this afternoon and we will have a news conference tomorrow
[02:40:31.480 --> 02:40:35.840]  with several of those members I just named in addition Lieutenant Colonel
[02:40:35.840 --> 02:40:41.120]  Tony Schaefer and in addition Colonel Pat Lane defense and tells the office
[02:40:41.120 --> 02:40:46.200]  is now retired they will speak and say that we do not need to commit troops
[02:40:46.200 --> 02:40:50.720]  to Syria and if the president thinks it's necessary he must come to Congress
[02:40:50.720 --> 02:40:55.520]  which is about it for so long Alex you know that if we had never gone into
[02:40:55.520 --> 02:41:00.720]  Libya and I realized Gaddafi was an evil man but if we'd never gone into Libya
[02:41:00.720 --> 02:41:04.760]  which the president bypassed Congress I'll remind you listeners of that he
[02:41:04.760 --> 02:41:10.160]  bypassed Congress bomb Libya and look at the mess in Libya we've lost an
[02:41:10.160 --> 02:41:15.560]  ambassador we lost a couple of Navy SEALs and and the controversy going over
[02:41:15.560 --> 02:41:20.680]  now about what happened in Benghazi but we created that problem we went in there
[02:41:20.680 --> 02:41:26.680]  and bombed a dictator and so I just feel this way I'm a big Ron Paul support as
[02:41:26.680 --> 02:41:30.640]  you well know we talked about that before and I believe that this country if
[02:41:30.640 --> 02:41:36.800]  we determine it's necessary to go into war then let the Congress declare war
[02:41:36.800 --> 02:41:42.120]  that we have not done since World War two well said I mean it's in the
[02:41:42.120 --> 02:41:46.840]  Constitution that the Congress directs the war funds the war declares war
[02:41:46.840 --> 02:41:50.560]  military actions and Congress has gone along with more and more that being
[02:41:50.560 --> 02:41:55.520]  given up but we saw the spectacle that you've spoken out against you probably
[02:41:55.520 --> 02:42:00.800]  the chief person that's been trying to expose it that in three different
[02:42:00.800 --> 02:42:07.760]  congressional hearings we have seen the spectacle of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
[02:42:07.760 --> 02:42:14.160]  telling Congress that they get their orders from the NATO chieftains and the
[02:42:14.160 --> 02:42:17.400]  UN and that the president gets those orders and the president's put out a
[02:42:17.400 --> 02:42:23.360]  letter agreeing to that I mean this is unprecedented and now have you seen the
[02:42:23.360 --> 02:42:26.520]  articles even in the New York Times where the main force that the West is
[02:42:26.520 --> 02:42:30.560]  funding this is already military action without congressional approval yeah is
[02:42:30.560 --> 02:42:37.120]  Al Qaeda absolutely and that that again is why I'm hopeful that and I realized
[02:42:37.120 --> 02:42:40.600]  with the tragedy in Connecticut and all the other issues that are swirling
[02:42:40.600 --> 02:42:45.960]  around here but we do not want the American people to forget that we have
[02:42:45.960 --> 02:42:50.640]  troops on the border in Turkey it doesn't take but one or two Americans to be
[02:42:50.640 --> 02:42:55.200]  killed and all of a sudden a president comes to the American people and say
[02:42:55.200 --> 02:42:59.360]  they just shot and killed two of our military people and we're not gonna
[02:42:59.360 --> 02:43:03.320]  stand for it and this again is why Ron Paul and I agree so much and Dennis
[02:43:03.320 --> 02:43:08.560]  Cassinage by the way that too many times that we in Congress is our fault not the
[02:43:08.560 --> 02:43:13.320]  president's fault that's the purpose of this letter this this letter is trying
[02:43:13.320 --> 02:43:20.680]  to encourage Congress to start living by the Constitution and not allowing any
[02:43:20.680 --> 02:43:25.640]  president the Democratic Republic to bypass Congress to bomb another country
[02:43:25.640 --> 02:43:29.740]  that's not an imminent threat to America we cannot police the world any longer
[02:43:29.740 --> 02:43:34.840]  Alex we have financially broke our kids have worn out the military equipment is
[02:43:34.840 --> 02:43:41.200]  worn out it's time to rebuild America and rebuild America's military well I
[02:43:41.200 --> 02:43:49.480]  agree with you but it's so unprecedented that Obama is shutting down cold power
[02:43:49.480 --> 02:43:55.080]  plants without congressional approval outside of law he signed a cyber order
[02:43:55.080 --> 02:43:58.680]  and won't let Congress see it last time I check when Congress is where the laws
[02:43:58.680 --> 02:44:05.560]  come from he says we're under UN control and now separately from the shooting
[02:44:05.560 --> 02:44:11.160]  Bloomberg is saying we want executive action outside of Congress to restrict
[02:44:11.160 --> 02:44:16.000]  guns sir what do you predict as a senior member of the House representatives
[02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:19.960]  what is going to happen in a folks just tuning representative Walter B. Jones of
[02:44:19.960 --> 02:44:24.800]  North Carolina as our guest what is your response going to be give in the new
[02:44:24.800 --> 02:44:31.400]  year maybe even before Obama just says hey I'm gonna use executive order to take
[02:44:31.400 --> 02:44:36.480]  people semi-autos well I'm gonna say this Alex I think that the American
[02:44:36.480 --> 02:44:42.800]  people and the Congress will challenge in the federal courts because again in my
[02:44:42.800 --> 02:44:47.840]  humble opinion I think that this is an overreach by this administration and I
[02:44:47.840 --> 02:44:51.760]  would further say and remind the listeners that when he went in the
[02:44:51.760 --> 02:44:55.840]  Libya Jonathan Turley who is a constitutional law professor at George
[02:44:55.840 --> 02:45:00.520]  Washington University joined led the effort in the courts with Dennis
[02:45:00.520 --> 02:45:04.880]  Cassinage Ron Paul Walter Jones Tim Johnson a couple of Democrats I can't
[02:45:04.880 --> 02:45:09.880]  remember their name now to continue the challenge that this president has
[02:45:09.880 --> 02:45:14.640]  bypassed Congress and you cannot and I think it's going to take a major court
[02:45:14.640 --> 02:45:19.000]  fight and we've got to have you know major leaders of our country including
[02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:24.600]  people like you Alex Jones to say enough is enough because if not this
[02:45:24.600 --> 02:45:29.240]  president has just and I was upset with George Bush when we went into Iraq so I
[02:45:29.240 --> 02:45:34.520]  want to be somewhat partisan on this but I'm gonna tell you this that what Mr.
[02:45:34.520 --> 02:45:39.360]  Obama has done starting with a number of issues but particularly when he came
[02:45:39.360 --> 02:45:46.000]  didn't even come to Congress and bombed Libya if that that's that's that's an
[02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:52.080]  international war crime it is it is I mean we're doing what Germany started
[02:45:52.080 --> 02:45:56.320]  doing in the lead-up to World War two going into Danzig going into Poland
[02:45:56.320 --> 02:46:03.120]  going into Czechoslovakia going into Austria and again it's foreign interest
[02:46:03.120 --> 02:46:06.760]  bragging I don't know if you've seen the headlines the Financial Times of London
[02:46:06.760 --> 02:46:11.080]  and even Time Magazine bragging that foreign banks say they've captured
[02:46:11.080 --> 02:46:15.240]  America and and I've heard Bloomberg financial brag all Congress is
[02:46:15.240 --> 02:46:20.520]  ceremonial I mean the bankers in prospectus is to each other are bragging
[02:46:20.520 --> 02:46:24.600]  we're a conquered people and that we're a joke and that now they're gonna take
[02:46:24.600 --> 02:46:33.720]  our guns and it's just so crazy to watch our government funding al-Qaeda to
[02:46:33.720 --> 02:46:38.560]  incinerate Libya and now Syria and again Assad's not a good guy but compared to
[02:46:38.560 --> 02:46:43.360]  al-Qaeda he is and he doesn't attacking anybody and al-Qaeda is engaged in
[02:46:43.360 --> 02:46:48.720]  atrocities all over these countries and and is the main force I mean it's like
[02:46:48.720 --> 02:46:54.720]  I woke up in twilight zone land but because he's supposedly a liberal can
[02:46:54.720 --> 02:46:59.240]  you imagine Congressman if George Bush was doing stuff like this what the left
[02:46:59.240 --> 02:47:06.000]  would be saying oh absolutely obviously what has really frustrated me that this
[02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:11.520]  is before the tragedy in Connecticut what's really frustrated me is exactly
[02:47:11.520 --> 02:47:15.520]  that's why again and I want to mention this why do we still have our kids in
[02:47:15.520 --> 02:47:19.920]  Afghanistan spending ten billion dollars a month we don't have they still get
[02:47:19.920 --> 02:47:24.280]  shot killed and losing legs and arms and I've got a website if any of your
[02:47:24.280 --> 02:47:28.200]  listeners would like to join this effort because we're gonna be raising
[02:47:28.200 --> 02:47:34.720]  cane in a bipartisan way about Afghanistan it's www dot this is one
[02:47:34.720 --> 02:47:43.360]  word bring the R.I.N.G. them T.H.E.M. home H.O.M.E. 2013.com I don't know where
[02:47:43.360 --> 02:47:47.360]  the outrageous is on that Alex you might have seen about two months ago this
[02:47:47.360 --> 02:47:51.440]  lady named Lisa Freeman her son was Captain Matthew Freeman Marine shot
[02:47:51.440 --> 02:47:55.800]  killed in 2009 she was interviewed because at that point a couple months
[02:47:55.800 --> 02:48:00.520]  ago 2,000 Americans had died in Afghanistan and her her comment was
[02:48:00.520 --> 02:48:04.440]  where's the outrage we've been there 11 years where where's the voices of the
[02:48:04.440 --> 02:48:08.520]  American people well that's what's so sick about this is that 20 children you
[02:48:08.520 --> 02:48:13.120]  know Stalin said one man dies it's a tragedy 10,000 dice is statistic listen
[02:48:13.120 --> 02:48:16.320]  I've got a four-year-old daughter I've got an eight-year-old daughter it I've
[02:48:16.320 --> 02:48:21.000]  got a 10-year-old son it tears my guts out to see this but to have him throw it
[02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:26.360]  in my face clearly to exploit it makes me sick and it makes me angry but then
[02:48:26.360 --> 02:48:30.880]  they admit I've seen it national statistics and polls never before have
[02:48:30.880 --> 02:48:34.720]  people cared less about the troops oh they say they care about them they're in
[02:48:34.720 --> 02:48:38.000]  the football game and it's like this little knick-knack thing but the truth
[02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:42.800]  is they're committing suicide at the record numbers they're making them serve
[02:48:42.800 --> 02:48:48.400]  five six seven eight tours and yeah bring them home bring and did you see
[02:48:48.400 --> 02:48:53.120]  sir with it where Obama just secretly sent 3,000 more troops back to Iraq oh
[02:48:53.120 --> 02:48:57.840]  yeah Alex that's the product that's the that's the whole issue of this letter
[02:48:57.840 --> 02:49:04.040]  quite frankly this president has not had his hands slapped by Congress yet he has
[02:49:04.040 --> 02:49:08.680]  not I can't even get my own side I don't mind telling you very quickly two weeks
[02:49:08.680 --> 02:49:14.320]  ago in our Republican conference I've had five Marines and one soldier from the
[02:49:14.320 --> 02:49:18.400]  third district of North Carolina shot and killed by the Afghans they were
[02:49:18.400 --> 02:49:22.420]  training and I stood up in the conference and I said Mr. Speaker I want to
[02:49:22.420 --> 02:49:25.760]  tell you something we're talking about all these financial problems facing
[02:49:25.760 --> 02:49:29.520]  America and I agree with you but how about this remembering those overseas
[02:49:29.520 --> 02:49:33.520]  who are getting killed and losing their legs in a war that's never been declared
[02:49:33.520 --> 02:49:39.880]  popping up a crook named Karzai so his family can keep selling drugs I said
[02:49:39.880 --> 02:49:44.440]  well where does it make any sense well you just answered it sir the big megabanks
[02:49:44.440 --> 02:49:48.040]  that run both major parties now they have been caught they've been caught
[02:49:48.040 --> 02:49:52.880]  laundering in mainstream news that heroin money and that's why the trips
[02:49:52.880 --> 02:49:56.320]  will probably never leave and it's incredible and you're right the country's
[02:49:56.320 --> 02:50:02.360]  descending into civil war I mean it's incredible Alex that's why you are such
[02:50:02.360 --> 02:50:07.160]  a leader of the Constitution in this country and people like yourself I've
[02:50:07.160 --> 02:50:11.280]  been on several shows as you know but you are making a difference and and I
[02:50:11.280 --> 02:50:16.440]  believe sincerely that we saw the marches when Obamacare got to the floor but
[02:50:16.440 --> 02:50:19.800]  when this debate starts on the second amendment I think you're gonna see the
[02:50:19.800 --> 02:50:25.160]  marches I really do I agree with you sir and we've got to defend the Republic
[02:50:25.160 --> 02:50:28.120]  give out that website one more time congressman thank you
[02:50:28.120 --> 02:50:40.680]  www.bringbring.com and there's a petition there on that site right that's
[02:50:40.680 --> 02:50:45.720]  exactly right listen we're gonna be debating this next year also bring them
[02:50:45.720 --> 02:50:51.080]  home in 2013 let's not see them die for a crook let's not see a country that's
[02:50:51.080 --> 02:50:53.680]  financially broken I agree and everybody's got to go to your press
[02:50:53.680 --> 02:50:59.040]  conference tomorrow this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[02:50:59.040 --> 02:51:03.480]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[02:51:03.480 --> 02:51:07.520]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[02:51:07.520 --> 02:51:11.400]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[02:51:11.400 --> 02:51:15.440]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:51:15.440 --> 02:51:20.000]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:24.640]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[02:51:24.640 --> 02:51:28.400]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[02:51:28.400 --> 02:51:31.880]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[02:51:31.880 --> 02:51:35.800]  onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[02:51:35.800 --> 02:51:38.960]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power

[02:55:20.080 --> 02:55:25.160]  involved with the school I ran the Cub Scouts the third and fourth grade out of
