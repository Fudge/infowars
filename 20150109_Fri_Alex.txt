[00:00.000 --> 00:14.640]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.640 --> 00:21.440]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.440 --> 00:30.520]  Britain's security service the MI5 has warned that Al Qaeda terrorists in Syria are planning mass
[00:30.520 --> 00:37.160]  casualty attacks in Western countries the MI5 chief Andrew Parker says it is highly likely
[00:37.160 --> 00:42.440]  that Britain would be targeted Parker said likely attacks are plotted against transport
[00:42.440 --> 00:48.880]  systems or iconic targets to inflict large-scale loss of life the spy master also said three
[00:48.880 --> 00:53.840]  terror plots were foiled in Britain in recent months he described the level of terror threat
[00:53.840 --> 00:59.280]  to Britain as very serious Parker added that the threat is possibly posed by British nationals
[00:59.280 --> 01:04.680]  who have joined terrorists in Syria he made those comments in a rare address in the wake of the
[01:04.680 --> 01:11.000]  deadly attack on a magazine office in Paris all right that's press TV reporting from England
[01:11.000 --> 01:24.120]  Wow the head of MI5 said jihadis out of Syria might attack Europe that's like saying the
[01:24.120 --> 01:33.000]  wind might blow someday or that birds might tweet or that crickets or insects might hop
[01:33.000 --> 01:41.640]  I'm not even going to attempt though we probably should to go back and pull the not dozens not
[01:41.640 --> 01:49.400]  hundreds but multiple hundreds of times that we predicted all this in the last two years that the
[01:49.400 --> 01:55.200]  Al Qaeda forces trained and renamed ISIS reconstituted bigger and better than ever hundreds of
[01:55.200 --> 02:03.560]  thousands of them would start attacking soft targets and I said newspapers police stations
[02:03.560 --> 02:14.560]  colleges elementary schools primary schools and then of course we'll have to have martial law
[02:14.560 --> 02:21.360]  not just at the airports but everywhere to keep us safe randomly as if any amount of police
[02:21.360 --> 02:31.440]  staff could ever protect you whether this is a false flag or not we know this western
[02:31.440 --> 02:35.880]  governments help create this threat they're now admitting these two brothers trained outside
[02:35.880 --> 02:42.520]  the country they had Facebook sites with their Al Qaeda flags with the hand signs with the guns
[02:42.520 --> 02:50.240]  implying what they were going to do and they were able to get weapons inside France rocket
[02:50.240 --> 02:59.600]  propelled grenades RPGs and automatic rifles and go around and kill 13 people now reportedly
[02:59.600 --> 03:03.080]  they're dead now we're hearing we've heard this before we heard this the day it happened and
[03:03.080 --> 03:11.200]  there's been explosions in the woods and supposedly the six hostages at a grocery store have been
[03:11.200 --> 03:16.880]  released I mean I hope all that's true this is all breaking as we speak I got a call this morning
[03:16.880 --> 03:31.360]  from a very high-level source and I'll just leave it at that confirming that an RPG was used
[03:31.360 --> 03:46.040]  it's an interesting factoid inside of the newspaper that was attacked two and a half days ago Charlie
[03:46.040 --> 03:56.240]  Hebdo and this high-level source is in the US military I'll just leave it at that in Europe
[03:56.240 --> 04:04.200]  and that is directly from their counterparts in the French anti-terror police so a rocket
[04:04.200 --> 04:14.880]  propelled grenade was used now you see reports that they had RPGs but the report is we have
[04:14.880 --> 04:21.120]  one out of the Daily Mail teenage suspect arrested after handing himself into police over Paris
[04:21.120 --> 04:26.280]  magazine massacre that left 12 people dead his anti-terror unit raids building to hunt for two
[04:26.280 --> 04:31.160]  brothers trained in Yemen as assassins and they said we are Al Qaeda from Yemen that's what
[04:31.160 --> 04:38.640]  witnesses said day one as well as AK-47 assault rifles there were also reports of rocket propelled
[04:38.640 --> 04:44.280]  grenades being used in the attack but they don't source them well let me tell you that comes directly
[04:44.280 --> 04:54.600]  from the anti-terror French police directly from NATO directly from a high-level source to me on
[04:54.600 --> 05:02.160]  the telephone 40 minutes ago every year we make resolutions to lose weight and get in shape and
[05:02.160 --> 05:08.000]  the truth is it's hard even with diet and exercise because of toxic food in our environment that is
[05:08.000 --> 05:13.240]  stressing our bodies more than ever before working with experts in nutrition and biochemistry I found
[05:13.240 --> 05:18.320]  that super high-quality nutraceuticals in addition to my diet and exercise were the answers
[05:18.320 --> 05:22.880]  and synergistically worked I can see the drastic changes every day with the amount of weight I've
[05:22.880 --> 05:28.400]  lost my increased stamina and more of a twinkle in my eye that's why we are now so excited to launch

[08:36.840 --> 08:44.400]  we've got to be asking ourselves a big question right now while the world watches in fixed
[08:44.400 --> 08:55.800]  rapture enjoying the spectacle of fear going on the spectacle of panic going on as they
[08:55.800 --> 09:05.680]  pop their popcorn and pour their cold beer so many people are simply voyors of violence
[09:05.680 --> 09:16.800]  and carnage as the world watches what else is going on what else is unfolding what else
[09:16.800 --> 09:23.320]  is happening in politics in world news in us news in science and technology in the economy
[09:23.320 --> 09:32.400]  it's all coming up today ladies and gentlemen on this live hard to believe hard to believe
[09:32.400 --> 09:42.480]  already the ninth day of January 2015 worldwide edition now just 10 minutes ago they said
[09:42.480 --> 09:52.000]  that both of the supposed terrorist shooters al qaeda from Yemen they claim had been killed
[09:52.000 --> 10:02.520]  and that hostages taken including women and children had survived now Reuters is reporting
[10:02.520 --> 10:08.600]  four of the hostages are dead and that the shooters are dead I'm not going to sit here
[10:08.600 --> 10:16.200]  today in minute by minute go over this because there's going to be a lot of disinformation
[10:16.200 --> 10:23.120]  a lot of media jumping to report the latest info we don't know this is a false flag we
[10:23.120 --> 10:28.120]  don't know if it's provocateur we don't know they protected these guys we don't know if
[10:28.120 --> 10:34.440]  they let him into the country we don't know or it may have just been missed maybe a real
[10:34.440 --> 10:45.880]  terror attack but what we do know is that the giant worldwide spy grid the french
[10:45.880 --> 10:53.000]  per capita have more spy systems and electronic snooping and are more open about it than even
[10:53.000 --> 11:01.320]  the United States is one of the most surveilled societies in the world and for all the electronic
[11:01.320 --> 11:08.160]  surveillance all the unconstitutional spying that France has that violates their own constitution
[11:08.160 --> 11:17.320]  as well it did not stop this you could turn France into a giant prison people won't be
[11:17.320 --> 11:22.400]  safe they'll be less safe one of the most dangerous places to be is a prison you can
[11:22.400 --> 11:34.880]  get more drugs more contraband more child porn more violence more stabbings than in a prison
[11:34.880 --> 11:40.760]  then you're going to have in the worst areas of chicago or new york city so the surveillance
[11:40.760 --> 11:48.720]  state didn't keep the french safe and now we have the two brothers with their facebook
[11:48.720 --> 11:55.240]  with their al-qaeda jihadi flags showing them at the shooting range i guess in yemen getting
[11:55.240 --> 12:00.960]  training for the attack and they've got their trendy girlfriends that follow them because
[12:00.960 --> 12:08.880]  they were hip hop mac daddies it fits the mo of narcissists with their selfies that this
[12:08.880 --> 12:17.760]  could be a real terror attack if i had to give you the profile and i've done this many
[12:17.760 --> 12:24.640]  times on air in the last few years by giving the profile of a real modern jihadi they're
[12:24.640 --> 12:34.120]  about 23 years old they listened to gangster rap music they wear pluma sweatpants sweatshirts
[12:34.120 --> 12:41.680]  and shoes i'm sorry that's just who they are they take constant selfies and see themselves
[12:41.680 --> 12:50.760]  as basically movie stars are narcissists taking selfies hanging out with your daughter because
[12:50.760 --> 12:56.320]  the coolest thing to do is a day to jihadi i mean come on just watch mtv just hang out
[12:56.320 --> 13:03.120]  on the college campus there's nothing cooler the fusion of the worst of gangster rap and
[13:03.120 --> 13:09.840]  the worst of radical islam to give us the mutation what do you call a mac daddy homie
[13:09.840 --> 13:20.240]  g jihadi a jihadi gangster a gangster jihadi how do you how do you compound word that and
[13:20.240 --> 13:28.360]  i'm on record saying over and over again and i don't brag i'm on record saying when we're
[13:28.360 --> 13:35.080]  right which is pretty much continually i pointed out because we really have the combination
[13:35.080 --> 13:41.720]  we have the code we know how things work we understand the program the social poisoning
[13:41.720 --> 13:51.880]  i said get ready for real asymmetrical attacks across the west by aimless welfare head spoiled
[13:51.880 --> 13:57.600]  rotten immigrant kids their parents are hard working their parents don't like what they're
[13:57.600 --> 14:03.040]  doing but they go into the toxic american culture you take radical islam and you add
[14:03.040 --> 14:11.280]  it into the evil western culture you're going to get something really nasty and that's what
[14:11.280 --> 14:16.040]  we've got here is this mutation and i see it all over facebook all over twitter you
[14:16.040 --> 14:20.320]  see it at the anti police rallies around the country with the ford foundation and soros
[14:20.320 --> 14:27.440]  right behind radicalizing holding up the isis signs i knew months ago we started getting
[14:27.440 --> 14:33.040]  all sorts of isis threats by punks on facebook and twitter threatening us and the government
[14:33.040 --> 14:40.600]  of course did nothing about it that this was a real situation when i started criticizing
[14:40.600 --> 14:46.080]  al qaeda four years ago in syria now known as isis or isle last year as a brand change
[14:46.080 --> 14:51.880]  to confuse the military and the american people that oh we're not having to battle who our
[14:51.880 --> 14:57.040]  government put in charge of the rebels in syria we're battling a new group that we keep
[14:57.040 --> 15:05.920]  accidentally giving airdrops of weapons to and so now we have to give up all of our freedoms
[15:05.920 --> 15:14.320]  and liberties because the jihadis have come to town and it can be used to then take freedoms
[15:14.320 --> 15:20.760]  across the board create new islamophobia which will be used to set up a larger police state
[15:20.760 --> 15:26.080]  that will end up being actually pointed at and deployed against gun owners returning
[15:26.080 --> 15:31.560]  veterans conservatives libertarians christians pro-lifers land rights activists get us out
[15:31.560 --> 15:38.040]  of the u.n. activists you name it and we've seen this carried out on a smaller scale beta
[15:38.040 --> 15:46.520]  tested over and over again since 9-11 but now it's being rolled out writ large i've
[15:46.520 --> 15:52.240]  told you i expect attacks on soft targets probably in paris first i don't know how folks
[15:52.240 --> 15:57.440]  the clips there's got to be 50 of those or more where i said in the last two years until
[15:57.440 --> 16:02.400]  you were sick of hearing it that we have a journal every day where we were right now
[16:02.400 --> 16:07.680]  notes of my predictions so we should be able to search that and pull a few you know you
[16:07.680 --> 16:13.880]  know clips of that just to show new listeners and i'm not just making these claims i said
[16:13.880 --> 16:20.360]  i would expect paris to get hit first and then london and then new york and then some
[16:20.360 --> 16:25.920]  city like austin texas i think austin i'll probably get hit because i just don't have
[16:25.920 --> 16:30.560]  to look at the whole background of what's being deployed and they won't have to stage
[16:30.560 --> 16:37.120]  at this time because they have promoted it and hyped it and pushed it to certain extents
[16:37.120 --> 16:44.240]  throughout the media that when al qaeda and ices puts out a report a week ago a video
[16:44.240 --> 16:52.760]  saying attack the french well it was time for those trained in yemen who in a anti gun
[16:52.760 --> 17:06.200]  anti defense anti freedom society like france were able to have rpgs and automatic weapons
[17:06.200 --> 17:12.200]  and go kill at least 13 people three of police officers and now they're saying at least four
[17:12.200 --> 17:18.040]  hostages are dead but there's still explosions and fire and smoke in france in the woods who
[17:18.040 --> 17:24.280]  knows what's going on will try to figure it out at another point it doesn't really matter
[17:24.280 --> 17:32.160]  though that's just a soap opera the larger issue is we predicted it it wasn't hard to
[17:32.160 --> 17:37.040]  predict it's like if you douse yourself in gasoline and light yourself on fire you're
[17:37.040 --> 17:43.120]  going to probably get burned not a very hard prediction to make and again that's how stupid
[17:43.120 --> 17:49.920]  the social engineers think you are and i'm are that's not proper english you are and
[17:49.920 --> 17:56.040]  i'm are that's how dumb they think we collectively are is that they could arm for four plus years
[17:56.040 --> 18:01.720]  give tens of billions of dollars through nato through the u.s through turkey and a bunch
[18:01.720 --> 18:08.240]  of other countries a coalition to gang up on libya gang up on syria turn the countries
[18:08.240 --> 18:14.240]  over to al qaeda and isis jihadis out of saudi arabia under any name it's the same thing
[18:14.240 --> 18:20.560]  the same black flags the same symbols the same bin laden brigade garbage to blow up
[18:20.560 --> 18:28.160]  every mosque that isn't radical every seaite mosque every alawite mosque every synagogue
[18:28.160 --> 18:34.520]  every church and crucify christians and rape them and murder them and conscript their daughters
[18:34.520 --> 18:46.320]  into sex slavery and to eat hearts on tv just scum of the earth our government did this
[18:46.320 --> 18:50.960]  and now hundreds of thousands at least two hundred thousand of these people are running
[18:50.960 --> 18:59.360]  around iraq and syria and many of them come from the united states england and trance
[18:59.360 --> 19:04.040]  and remember last year and the year before when it was in the news that they were allowing
[19:04.040 --> 19:08.040]  people to recruit on facebook and twitter in the u.s and england and europe to go back
[19:08.040 --> 19:13.200]  and forth and that french and british and others were letting them fly back and forth
[19:13.200 --> 19:18.760]  in their muslim gear with the with the beards with the bin laden flags shaying on their
[19:18.760 --> 19:26.680]  facebook's we're going to afghanistan we're going to libya we're going to syria we're
[19:26.680 --> 19:32.440]  going to iraq to fight jihad and western governments who were funding it in the zone
[19:32.440 --> 19:39.000]  let them recruit online and let them go back and forth and now let them attack in paris
[19:39.000 --> 19:45.360]  so they have a justification to grab my genitals or put me a naked body scanner at the airport
[19:45.360 --> 19:51.880]  what a stinking giant disgusting fraud and now the head of the n i five says brace for
[19:51.880 --> 19:59.800]  al qaeda isis to attack the west will play that clip when we come back stay with us

[35:02.000 --> 35:07.840]  then encourages terrorists to attack you to take control of your civilization and make you give
[35:07.840 --> 35:13.920]  into their demands now if you have criminal elements in control of the civilization at the
[35:13.920 --> 35:20.880]  heights of corporate governance as well as governmental systems if they can take control
[35:20.880 --> 35:28.000]  and run your life and get trillions in no bid contracts over the last 15 years would the
[35:28.000 --> 35:35.520]  government at least allow terrorists to attack if as a society every time there's an attack
[35:35.520 --> 35:41.680]  we lose more freedom even though losing more freedom doesn't protect us from another attack
[35:43.280 --> 35:48.720]  the way the media dramatizes 13 people that are dead sure it's a tragedy we're sad
[35:48.720 --> 35:54.080]  we hope the hostages weren't killed some of them reportedly got it alive because they had children
[35:54.080 --> 36:00.320]  with them i've got one of those images on my screen of a father with a son and a woman
[36:01.360 --> 36:06.480]  being ushered out by the police they say the two terrorists are supposedly dead and
[36:07.120 --> 36:12.560]  that four of the hostages were killed but in the big picture as you know i say honeybees
[36:12.560 --> 36:17.120]  killed 200 and something people a year wasp 300 and something deer running out in front of your
[36:17.120 --> 36:22.640]  cars is over 500 deer with their antlers kill more than 10 people a year oh yeah look it up
[36:23.840 --> 36:29.440]  but see deer aren't scary honeybees aren't scary great white sharks kill about five people a year
[36:29.440 --> 36:35.680]  worldwide and most people are scared to swim in over their neck in the ocean most people i know
[36:35.680 --> 36:41.840]  because they think sharks will eat them you've got a better chance of a leprechaun changing your oil
[36:43.120 --> 36:46.720]  well maybe you got a better chance of a shark biting in the leprechaun changing your oil
[36:46.720 --> 36:53.680]  because leprechauns don't exist now i'm a conspiracy theorist i'm sorry maybe they do maybe i'm racist
[36:53.680 --> 36:58.160]  against irish people because i'm saying leprechauns don't exist you know that's the answer to any
[36:58.160 --> 37:03.120]  intellectual argument you can't win just say someone's a racist but i'm going far afield now aren't i
[37:05.120 --> 37:10.880]  it is so frustrating to see my freedom your freedom our freedom being flushed down a toilet
[37:10.880 --> 37:15.760]  while the borders are wide open i mean how transparent is this
[37:17.520 --> 37:23.360]  france is wide open to open immigration illegals pour in every day get put on welfare
[37:24.880 --> 37:29.360]  the country is on the verge of economic collapse by every metric just like spain
[37:29.360 --> 37:36.160]  portugal greece ireland and other areas the bankers are taking control of it
[37:36.160 --> 37:42.880]  the french government saying you can't say father and mother on documents because it
[37:42.880 --> 37:49.840]  hurts people that aren't male or female oh see being a father hurts someone that can't be a father
[37:52.320 --> 37:58.640]  see where this tyranny goes this is mind control oh but these jihadis which more and more i think
[37:59.200 --> 38:03.840]  evidence is leaning towards this being a real attack they get to go on facebook
[38:03.840 --> 38:10.800]  let's put up their facebook for tv viewers so we can a headline daily mail facebook of
[38:11.360 --> 38:16.000]  terror suspects found and they're on there with their rifles and with their spent cartridges
[38:16.000 --> 38:21.600]  giving their hand signs meaning they're gonna kill for a la and nothing was done but i've seen
[38:21.600 --> 38:31.680]  articles in the french press where vacationing americans will joke about you know we're gonna
[38:31.680 --> 38:38.320]  blow this place up partying and within two hours french police knock down their rich carlton door
[38:38.880 --> 38:44.880]  dragging them out because they said we're gonna blow this place up partying they could look and
[38:44.880 --> 38:50.720]  see they were party animals no criminal record that that it was in context of partying but they
[38:50.720 --> 38:56.640]  went ahead and swapped teams them same thing happened a few years ago where there was a text
[38:56.640 --> 39:02.080]  message in the united states of some visitors in la saying something similar they got a visit
[39:02.080 --> 39:08.000]  remember uh the folks searching for pressure cookers weren't even muslim in florida got swat
[39:08.000 --> 39:18.320]  teamed they wanted pressure cookers to cook some food i have a crock pot and a pressure cooker i
[39:18.320 --> 39:25.840]  have a big crock pot for putting turkeys and chickens in it i expect a swat team attack any
[39:25.840 --> 39:31.760]  minute i'm being sarcastic but might as well everybody knows i'm not a jihadi everybody knows
[39:31.760 --> 39:38.000]  i'm not planning a terror attack actually southern poverty law center adl msnbc came out and said that
[39:38.000 --> 39:45.280]  i'm quote connected to the boston bombers yes ladies and gentlemen it looks like they may have
[39:45.280 --> 39:51.600]  visited my website which gets millions of visitors a day it's like saying they visited cnn so
[39:51.600 --> 40:02.080]  cnn is guilty as well so this is the attempt that we see taking place are you upset about this
[40:02.800 --> 40:09.280]  our government creates a new islamic army under the name isis our military gets upset about it
[40:09.280 --> 40:13.680]  says we won't fall on the side of al-qaeda ted cruz and rand paul come out and say that a year
[40:13.680 --> 40:18.160]  and a half ago so they changed the name to isis it's the same group and now they're connected
[40:18.160 --> 40:26.320]  directly to these guys who reportedly traveled to yemen for training and then posted the jihad photos
[40:27.680 --> 40:34.160]  from yemen with them training at training camps with ak-47s and then they got back into france
[40:34.160 --> 40:43.040]  with rocket propelled grenades rpgs and full auto kalishtikovs and nothing was done about it
[40:43.040 --> 40:50.400]  but just like with the fbi cooking the bomb giving them the detonators and then a mod salem
[40:51.680 --> 40:55.840]  tries to stop it and he's pulled off the case and they send in another bomb maker to help
[40:55.840 --> 41:04.080]  them finish it and let them carry out the attack because then you get more funding and congress
[41:04.080 --> 41:11.520]  is calling for more anti-terror laws and the french are and the british are let's play the mi5
[41:11.520 --> 41:19.120]  head here's the roiders headline britain's mi5 chief warns al-qaeda and syria planning mass attacks
[41:19.120 --> 41:29.520]  on the west oh they've got more than 10 000 heat seeking shoulder fired impad surface to air misoos
[41:31.040 --> 41:38.800]  that aren't much bigger than an rpg if these guys could smuggle at least three rpgs they were seen
[41:38.800 --> 41:44.000]  with one they used inside the newspaper that's from info wars you're getting that
[41:45.520 --> 41:53.120]  can they get a chinese copy of a stinger in can they get a us modern stinger because the
[41:53.120 --> 42:01.440]  stuff they've got's mainly us oh i've even had by name the cia pilot tosh plumbly on to talk
[42:01.440 --> 42:09.680]  about is nato source and others flying the weapons into them the military gets so upset they land
[42:09.680 --> 42:15.120]  because they have military that offloads it they have contractor pilots and the jihadi shoot their
[42:15.120 --> 42:20.640]  mouths off and say we're going to kill you next in english that's how air imagine being a special
[42:20.640 --> 42:31.040]  forces nato soldier us soldier and you land in jordan or you land in iran or you land in turkey
[42:31.040 --> 42:37.520]  at these training camps and at the airport at the air base a truck pulls up and it's a 25-year-old
[42:37.520 --> 42:43.600]  jihadi from england with a 23-year-old jihadi from france with a 30-year-old jihadi handler from the
[42:43.600 --> 42:52.480]  us and they even smartmouth them when they're giving them the weapons i have that directly
[42:53.040 --> 42:59.200]  from people offloading the weapons you understand that's why you saw thousands of officers
[42:59.200 --> 43:03.120]  covering their faces holding up pieces of paper saying i won't fight for al-qaeda in syria
[43:03.120 --> 43:09.840]  because it's so sick the american people may buy it and may be in a coma and not know how big this
[43:09.840 --> 43:17.680]  is but the military does that's why dempsi went to obama two years ago at midnight on a friday and
[43:17.680 --> 43:24.000]  said the military is going to rebel if you try to launch a air bombardment against syrian targets
[43:24.000 --> 43:31.600]  and if you try to send in ground troops Assad's done nothing to anybody the military is finally
[43:31.600 --> 43:39.040]  waking up and dempsi didn't do that because he's an angel the military got it folks if we can
[43:39.040 --> 43:45.840]  duplicate that it's game over for this and we're an inch away from that right now the bold move
[43:45.840 --> 43:55.840]  the naked move i mean we had a former colonel in the egyptian military on who just loves america
[43:55.840 --> 44:02.720]  loves the us military hates radical islam worked for the fbi saying unfortunately it looks like
[44:02.720 --> 44:09.360]  our government's arming isis and is behind it and he was very upset and he said this is to
[44:09.360 --> 44:17.520]  scapegoat islam and create his class of civilizations he gets it he gets it and it's to turn the middle
[44:17.520 --> 44:25.920]  east over to a bunch of wahhabist cavemen well i stand against radical islam i'm sorry i'm a
[44:25.920 --> 44:31.840]  radical i stand against shooting police in the head i'm a bad person i stand against al-qaeda

[45:38.160 --> 45:48.480]  to this show how can i reach people it's like it's it's exactly what you say as soon as
[45:48.480 --> 45:54.640]  someone doesn't agree they say oh he's racist oh he you know that's their argument to everything
[45:54.640 --> 46:00.160]  plus because you got a dumb dumb population on all sides that just bleep out uh stereotypical
[46:00.160 --> 46:04.960]  words because they're not informed it just makes them feel smart and you know we have every race
[46:04.960 --> 46:09.680]  color and creed listening to this broadcast and that's why these types of shows are important
[46:09.680 --> 46:14.320]  so everybody can talk to each other so if you want to reach out to folks you can do it right
[46:14.320 --> 46:21.200]  here on the air go ahead right i just you know i just really don't even i just wanted to bring up
[46:21.200 --> 46:27.360]  that point i know other people may have you know problems reaching out to other people in their
[46:27.360 --> 46:33.280]  community um they just don't really understand what's going on and and like you said they just
[46:33.280 --> 46:39.040]  always call it racist i just wanted to bring up that point but um thanks for all that you know man
[46:39.040 --> 46:44.240]  please don't thank me like like limbaugh says just say ditto thank you so much your sweetheart
[46:44.240 --> 46:50.880]  please i want to thank you pete in michigan you're on the air welcome hi there alex uh long time
[46:50.880 --> 46:57.520]  listener i was just calling in about this whole terrorist attack in france um i i don't know if
[46:57.520 --> 47:02.080]  you really come to a solid conclusion of what they're going to try to get out of this um are
[47:02.080 --> 47:06.720]  they going to try to restrict our freedom of speech out of this absolutely they're going to try to
[47:06.720 --> 47:11.920]  bring in cyber security uh with new fake cyber pearl harbors they're getting ready and then with
[47:11.920 --> 47:16.720]  this they're going to try to bring in new political correctness i mean shopping carts all over won't
[47:16.720 --> 47:22.000]  let you sell uh stuff even mildly critical of islam uh google won't let us sell the obama
[47:22.000 --> 47:27.920]  deception saying it's racist uh that's what's coming out of this is we have to shut up we have to
[47:27.920 --> 47:35.440]  comply we have to go along with the system and the reason i said that i think this may be a real
[47:35.440 --> 47:42.640]  attack sure the door was open the training was allowed it was protected so it is a false flag
[47:42.640 --> 47:52.320]  light uh but i've seen the real sexiness the real avon guard foe it's foe avon guard it's fake
[47:53.760 --> 48:02.000]  promotion of g-hotting as some type of liberal socialist cutting-edge army uh in social media
[48:02.000 --> 48:08.960]  it's been allowed to operate and so they're just creating the clash of civilizations so that the
[48:08.960 --> 48:15.520]  west kills muslims and muslims kill us instead of us just promoting cooperation science technology
[48:15.520 --> 48:20.720]  and freedom just like the globalists just like the rothschilds helped get world war one going
[48:20.720 --> 48:25.840]  that killed six million germans three million french a million brettes couple hundred thousand
[48:25.840 --> 48:32.720]  americans world war two killed 21 million germans 22 million russians almost 400 000 americans about
[48:32.720 --> 48:38.160]  400 000 brettes i'm going from memory you can look these numbers up those were all basically staged
[48:38.160 --> 48:44.640]  they were real wars but the the banking cartels manipulated it on both sides now they want the
[48:44.640 --> 48:52.880]  third conflict but to be between the west and islam and out of that clash just like the west
[48:52.880 --> 48:58.800]  versus communism we both become more authoritarian in confronting each other because it's being
[48:58.800 --> 49:07.360]  manipulated by the central globalist committees what do you think's coming out of this pete well i
[49:07.360 --> 49:11.840]  think that you're right on spot with that and i have a kind of a question or recommendation
[49:11.840 --> 49:17.680]  an idea that might be groundbreaking for you um kind of goes along with what the last caller was
[49:17.680 --> 49:22.480]  talking about trying to get people together a couple weeks ago i tried calling him because you
[49:22.480 --> 49:30.320]  had mentioned something about us getting together and going together on things have you ever thought
[49:30.320 --> 49:34.640]  about i know you've done the the dating website thing a while back i don't know what sure we
[49:34.640 --> 49:39.120]  did a social network planet in full wars dot com it's primitive but it works good for people to
[49:39.120 --> 49:43.920]  meet each other and stuff and that's one subsection of it yes what i was wondering is could you come

[49:49.280 --> 49:56.560]  together by their area and uh maybe you know just pull together and pull our resources to prepare
[49:56.560 --> 50:01.040]  for what's coming down the tubes absolutely you know we have the prison planet um
[50:01.040 --> 50:03.040]  um
[50:04.480 --> 50:09.920]  area where people can go in there and talk we have we have planet info wars dot com

[54:13.360 --> 54:17.520]  the ongoing soap opera very closely today because so much disinformation comes out
[54:17.520 --> 54:24.000]  in the fog of this hysteria first they claim that both of the terrorist suspects have been killed
[54:26.560 --> 54:31.280]  now they're saying that one of them is on the loose first they said the hostages hadn't been
[54:31.280 --> 54:37.360]  killed now four have been killed it is just all over the map right now clearly these guys had
[54:37.360 --> 54:44.240]  accomplices to get rpgs and fully autos into france they say they're working with isis and
[54:44.240 --> 54:51.200]  al-qaeda they went to yemen for training this is all part of the saudi arabian crescent of radical
[54:51.200 --> 54:57.440]  islamification that they used to take over the middle east and most middle eastern countries
[54:57.440 --> 55:05.200]  hate these jihadis i want to be clear doesn't mean you have to even agree with islam i'm just
[55:05.200 --> 55:11.520]  being accurate here they hate it imagine you're living in iraq you can go to the movies your
[55:11.520 --> 55:16.320]  daughter can go to college you get overthrown now they're chopping your heads off or syria
[55:17.760 --> 55:20.240]  i mean you could go to syria folks and order a beer
[55:22.880 --> 55:29.360]  not anymore where the al-qaeda people are in charge i mean our government is putting the
[55:29.360 --> 55:34.080]  worst people in charge to destabilize those regions just like they're trying to destabilize
[55:34.080 --> 55:39.520]  us and take our freedom away just like they've caught the fed's arming street gangs going back
[55:39.520 --> 55:45.680]  to the 60s just like we caught the justice department arming drug cartels i mean it's
[55:45.680 --> 55:53.680]  bad people in government folks and corporations i'm going to go to a caller in france steven france
[55:54.560 --> 56:02.160]  what is your view on this go ahead uh good evening alex thank you for taking the call
[56:02.800 --> 56:08.560]  well it seems like uh i don't know if you hear me well but i do sir go ahead like
[56:08.560 --> 56:16.880]  you hear yes sir okay that it seems to me like uh everybody here is taking it the same as 2001 in
[56:16.880 --> 56:23.200]  america uh it's a big shock for everybody because there's no good for him and having to deal with
[56:23.200 --> 56:29.840]  measurements and get down to the cops and people like this work it's an outrage that i don't know
[56:29.840 --> 56:36.480]  now what is going to be happening but they are already talking about arming the cops and and
[56:36.480 --> 56:43.360]  making huge amount of security i think it was if it was a plot which i'm not going to say was uh
[56:44.000 --> 56:50.240]  but if it was a plot it would be perfectly targeted to motivate all french people to accept
[56:50.240 --> 56:58.800]  the same kind of law that are coming to america uh as lots of army police the same way as military
[56:58.800 --> 57:04.560]  and have them check everybody in the street and have a huge police say you said it right
[57:04.560 --> 57:10.000]  there succinctly uh just like the white house chief of staff rome manuel now chicago mayor said
[57:10.000 --> 57:14.960]  we never let a good crisis go to waste whether it was staged or not they're going to use it
[57:15.840 --> 57:23.040]  to basically intensify the totalitarian state just as france economically from what i've seen
[57:23.040 --> 57:29.200]  in the numbers is in deep trouble we know historically with economic trouble comes totalitarianism
[57:29.200 --> 57:35.520]  do you agree with uh an outsider's view that the EU and france is having economic trouble
[57:35.520 --> 57:41.360]  and that the government's trying to amass more power of course the EU is controlling the whole
[57:41.360 --> 57:47.920]  the whole europe and who control EU probably america so there's problem in france and everywhere
[57:47.920 --> 57:55.040]  um you know i can see also with this uh with this event uh the president of our land he's having
[57:55.040 --> 58:01.040]  a very low rating right now i wouldn't be surprised if they can catch those guys which right now i
[58:01.040 --> 58:06.560]  think there's two old state situation in france one important thing in part next to paris with
[58:06.560 --> 58:12.880]  one guy and two other guys somewhere on the on the west side of paris that's right all the
[58:12.880 --> 58:16.720]  north that's right well stay there sir don't hang up i want to come back to you in one minute

[58:22.160 --> 58:28.400]  france as well france lost three million people in world war one folks and then now france is saying
[58:28.400 --> 58:32.640]  we've got to give up all of our liberties because of 13 dead or 15 dead or whatever it is i want to
[58:32.640 --> 58:37.360]  ask him his view on giving up liberty for security well you never end up getting a liberty you get

[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:12.560]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:21.520]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:25.600]  we had a caller from massedownia that had some really interesting points to make
[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:33.520]  about radical islamists being brought in to all those countries and protected by the west but he
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:42.880]  hung up we're finishing up with steve charles de gaulle after world war two basically they started
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:46.800]  setting up the bilderberg group and other organizations you can say what you want about
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:52.000]  him but he was for sovereignty and the french people and he called all the major french leaders
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.640]  in a famous speech and said when he was elected president we're not going to tolerate any of
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:01.200]  you being sold out to foreigners we're going to have national sovereignty and i'm basically going
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:06.240]  to come after you if you engage in treason you can differ with what the government's saying you're
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:14.480]  not going to work with foreign outsiders the french basically ended up grabbing their nuclear
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:19.440]  weapons away from nato at an airport there was a big standoff that stuff's in the history books
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:24.960]  but most people don't know about it and then the west through british intelligence and the jackal
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:29.680]  tried to actually kill de gaulle you won't see that in the history books but that's in some of the
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:36.400]  deeper documents what you have is a bunch of financial interest in the the french president is a puppet
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:42.560]  totally trying to indent them get them into a socialist system you can make fun of france
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:47.120]  being so socialist folks we're only a few years away from them obama just came out and announced
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:52.320]  free community college as if it'll be free it'll be indoctrination it'll fully federalize community
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:02:00.000]  college so we look at france and where they've gone that's where we're going and just as they use
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:05.680]  9-11 to take our freedoms they're going to use this now to take french freedoms and france has
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:11.680]  been deeply involved the french government in funding these very jihadis uh other points you'd
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:17.600]  like to make as someone in france as you said dreading the militarization of police that'll
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:27.360]  obviously be used on you anything else steve you know i think we have no choice in french to go to
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:33.040]  militarize police nobody has gone nobody has armed we cannot defend ourselves against
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.400]  standoffs like this and it's never going to happen it's not in the mentality of french people to
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:45.200]  have weapons at home so it's never going to be happening so they have to come up to this solution
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:49.840]  of more police and i think we are going to be the ones following america with the with the
[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:55.440]  songs of police now america is following we got associations and down there down the road but
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:03:01.600]  we are the ones following america and about me the u.s. government has already proposed to help
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:10.400]  france to set up anti-terrorism action in france to set up isn't that just perfect the west creates
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:15.840]  a new giant al-qaeda ocean breaks the dam pours them into our countries and now they're going to
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:22.640]  take our freedoms and put us in a prison collectively a giant gulag a giant ghetto to protect us
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:27.600]  isn't that just sweet and and think about it this didn't stop the french having their guns
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:34.640]  taken the last 30 years didn't stop the jihadis from getting rpgs you can't buy those anywhere
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:41.920]  any other comments no i don't i don't i don't know how french people would get those kind of
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:48.320]  weapons it's impossible well i think they had helped clearly and i think we're going to find out
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:54.240]  that the french government knew and bare minimum quote dropped the ball and let this happen what
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:04:01.360]  do you think it could be i don't know it's like they have to have a lot in the in the deal because
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:06.240]  they knew exactly it was known that they were meeting every Wednesday but they had to know
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:14.080]  more detail i don't know it's just shocking for everybody and i but i think i think because of
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:19.200]  this action we're going to come up to the stand mutualized as america i hear you i appreciate
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:22.880]  your call and of course the final point and all of this will come back and take more calls and

[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:21.280]  that's all coming up with a bunch of economic news global warming weather news and what's
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:26.000]  happening with the oil economy it's all coming up after i go through all the callers that are
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:32.640]  currently holding we just took a call from france saying they fear a police state they're not allowed
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:38.400]  to be armed judge depolitano rightfully set on fox news it's like shooting fish in a barrel because
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:44.160]  no one is allowed to be armed what cowards to go around and shoot a bunch of unarmed people
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:49.360]  i will say this before i go to your calls no one i know is buying this
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:56.080]  almost none of our listeners are buying it and quite frankly they're a little ticked with me
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:10:03.440]  that i'm not saying out of hand it's a false flag it is a false flag the media has promote i'm
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:08.240]  going to explain it not a false flag that these aren't real terrorists they're synthetic the cultures
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:13.040]  promoted it they've been protected he was in prison he was trained under a jihadi they were
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:18.240]  allowed to go to yemen they had all these weapons they had facebook clearly planning this they were
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:25.280]  protected so it is a false flag in that respect just like they created the new al-qaeda forces
[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:33.520]  and gave them money in syria that's the whole point of this then when they attack us the government
[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:38.880]  has an excuse for an authoritarian takeover but i don't think it's a fake shooting i don't think
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:44.720]  it's a blue screen i don't think that the you know i i'm looking at it right now i may be wrong
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:51.280]  the west is funding radical jihad all over europe they're trying to overthrow russia with it
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:58.800]  putans called us out on it do you understand the cia funded the zarnab brothers to go to
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:03.760]  chechnya on record that was in mainstream news i don't know what happened with the boston bombing
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:11.040]  i just know that should be looked into every time these people have western intelligence
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:16.400]  shock puppeting them they're always narcissistic people that want to be movie stars
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:22.080]  who then get set up think they're agents double agents and get set up in drills i don't know
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:29.600]  i just know past cases mi6 was behind the seven seven bombings that came out let's go to alexander
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:34.880]  in massedonia that's where the real alexander the great came from massedonian world conquer
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:41.520]  who knows alexander might be related to him alexander what is your take uh there in the
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:48.880]  former greek province i guess now a u n zone u n occupied zone what is your view from massedonia
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:57.920]  on what's happening 200 percent we uh i'm a first-time caller uh i will release into your
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:06.480]  show for uh many years and uh what's my take uh i just want to tell you a few facts about the
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:13.120]  jihadist terror we're living under uh maybe we have this john statue of uh king alexander
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:21.760]  on the the main square in skopje but in fact we we we are under jihadist slavery uh we're
[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:28.800]  placed uh we are being uh limited to them in in forms of uh we're paying taxes utilities
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:35.120]  and everything our business are uh financially broke uh the the jihadis are not paying anything
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:41.840]  you know and and and just multiplying uh each year now let's explain the socialist plan to
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:47.920]  explain to people massedonia formerly part of greece what the u n did how they brought it down
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:53.040]  how they brought in all the foreigners they give them everything free and then they act as the group
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:57.360]  to blow stuff up if you get out of line and then the police because i mean i'm i'm familiar with
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:03.600]  the situation massedonia is under explain to people the model they'll use in london in paris
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:10.640]  and in new york yeah that's massedonia nowadays it's like consular 20 years ago or 11 on 30 years
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:19.440]  ago so the same situation it's like copy spaced uh you know agenda uh in on the in the whole of
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:25.120]  near nearest uh middle east and uh the balkan countries but i want to be effective i don't
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:30.960]  want to miss uh waste your time i just want to tell you about this uh the easter massacre
[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:37.440]  which happened in massedonia when the jihadis killed five of our kids 20 to 21 years old
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:42.960]  they were just fishing on the reservoir and none of these mainstream media has told the
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:48.160]  team about these massacre you know in a country of less than two million we're two million according
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:53.920]  to census but about half a million of the people flat you know because of the uh you know economic
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:14:01.040]  downturn uh to kill five kids uh you know that that's like that killing 750 kids in in in the
[01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:08.080]  states so nobody mentioned about it so i i you have a lot of admirers and listeners here in the
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:15.040]  in the balkans in massedonia all over the place so i would like to as you know uh san paul got

[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:39.200]  the problem is just as the colonel salem said yesterday the problem is the west and the un
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:49.520]  are funding this sickening fusion of socialist un kami gang bang mac daddy gangster rap arab jihadi
[01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:57.600]  and i don't care if they're chechen jihadis or they're mastodonian jihadis or they're
[01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:06.800]  kosovo jihadis or they're new york jihadis or london jihadis or syrian jihadis or iranian jihadis
[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:15.840]  they're all funded by saudi arabia and protected and the welfare system of the world has been told
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:20.320]  you green light and these people go to the head of the line they don't get searched at the airport
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:28.480]  that's come out in the news nothing they are god because they're the detonator to bring in the
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:37.760]  police state and they just just europe is being turned over and then they come in bully on the
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:45.440]  streets of new york london you name it the other muslims into doing what they're told
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:52.000]  it's basically mafia humans organize themselves into mafia whenever folks say you know it's the
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.320]  catholic church or it's the jews or it's the masons that run everything you know what it is
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:02.240]  it's criminal gangs that take over jewish organizations it's gangs that take over the
[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:09.360]  islamic organizations it's gangs that take over the catholic organizations you'll find it's gangs
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:17.280]  that use gang psychology russia's basically run by former kgb that set up a gang and made
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:22.880]  themselves oligarchs i don't want government by gang i want government by the republic by
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:28.160]  freedom by due process where the people are organized to defend basic freedoms so that no
[01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:35.360]  gang can get together and overthrow that that creates prosperity but yeah there's a worldwide
[01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:44.000]  jewish mafia involved in derivatives and all sorts of scams very powerful trying to erode free
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.840]  speech here in the united states in europe so that nobody can criticize what they're doing
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:53.120]  but the average jew doesn't even understand that or know that there is a catholic several
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:57.360]  catholic mafias actually several jewish mafias they kill each other constantly so that's another
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:01.600]  reason about just bashing israel mindlessly there's like five different groups two major power
[01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:06.480]  groups killing each other constantly indicting each other it's just the catholic church is
[01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:11.280]  probably seven or eight different groups the cia's seven or eight different groups the nsa's three
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:16.320]  different groups it just doesn't work like that the fbis at least three different groups
[01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:24.480]  and and and then now you got to add gay groups to it because gay groups seem to organize into
[01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:28.720]  gangs with their own neighborhoods in their own whatever i'm not against gay people but i'm not
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:34.480]  in your gang and and if i was gay i shouldn't be forced into your gang you know that's another thing

[01:18:55.920 --> 01:19:03.840]  that the police tend to turn into gangs and when a police department acts like a gang you got a
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:10.880]  problem when they don't you got a good police department gangs are our problem and you look
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:16.320]  at these jihadis worldwide they'll have their drawers hanging down over their butts they'll be

[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:55.600]  hostages were dead it just goes on and on so they're changing the story constantly man well your
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:25:01.200]  point on that yeah how you doing well basically i'm watching it right now and they're saying that
[01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:07.200]  olan is he has a team in the ministry and they're talking about negotiations with the terrorists
[01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:14.400]  i'm watching live footage from the north of france and they have a whole bunch of team police police
[01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:20.960]  uh response team units there surrounded the whole entire town the mayor has the town on lockdown
[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:25.520]  nobody could come out they're all locked in their houses everything is locked down in the
[01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:29.920]  man i'm not bragging but if there were terrorists across the street i'd grab my m4 grab the guys
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:34.000]  and go over and attack them i mean how many thousands of police and military does it take
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:39.760]  to kill two scumbags i mean i just i mean back at ut when the shooter started attacking citizens
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:44.240]  pulled their guns out started shooting and it was a citizen that climbed up with a local cop and
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:48.560]  took him out it was a citizen to pull the trigger and shot him first with a shotgun i mean that's a
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:54.800]  fact i'm not here shooting my mouth off i mean i just cannot believe all this groveling like
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:59.760]  shutting boston down for one teenager remember that i think it's so they can cover up what's
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:05.280]  really going on what do you think i'm pretty sure that there's something different going on
[01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:09.200]  that what the reporters are telling us you know i'm a first-time caller by the way i listen to
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:16.640]  your show every single day um i'm you're you're 100 accurate um but yeah in this situation right
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:22.560]  here definitely people should you know there's got to be gun didn't just say that in france
[01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:26.880]  there's no more gun ownership so you know there's probably no gun owners in the air they don't have
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:33.040]  weapons with them but yeah um you know i'm pretty sure that i don't know what how accurate their
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:38.160]  reporting is but like i said it's live it's live footage they have the police there surrounded the
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:44.720]  town well buckley my cousin speaks fluent spanish so he's on it in there watching the feed right now
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:48.480]  we'll uh confirm your report i believe it but we're going to check into it and we'll get some

[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:10.800]  lived in southeast michigan mess with the trade area uh i worked at the Ford Mustang plant i've been

[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:26.880]  are cutting out our power please no what i was going to say is uh with this parent situation
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:32.480]  i'm not really like a Wayne metton or uh uh Steve pacenic but um what i think about is that if we
[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:38.480]  already have a huge uh islam arabic population is there in the metro and toy city called gearborn
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:44.320]  in a lot of those recipes from iraq and uh can of stand and stuff like that and i think that this
[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:51.040]  parent the pac was basically a message from the elitist a reminder if you will like hey you know
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:55.440]  i'm still here we're still here still be afraid you know don't forget about it this guy's got

[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:06.960]  so well the thing about that it also sends a inspiration if you will like a message uh to

[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:17.760]  you know and i know that that's uh if you're sure it's true i actually make hip hop music about
[01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:22.960]  about waking up about well i'm not saying hip hop or rap itself is bad i'm saying the gangster type
[01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:28.880]  is being pushed by the system and tends to then meld with this certain criminal type it's like
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:34.000]  saying most mass shooters or shoot them up video game heads it's not saying mass shooting
[01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:40.960]  games themselves make you a killer it's that they help trigger with the right kind of emo
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:48.560]  psychology then they can be a problem with those type people i really appreciate your call it's like
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:52.560]  most folks can have a few drinks here and there and not become alcoholics but some people do

[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:03.280]  you know you turn the light on at midnight to get some water and there's a cockroach on the counter
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:08.080]  and it's eating a piece of bread you're like guy i know you just want to live and just want to have
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:15.280]  babies and everything and you know you didn't do anything to anybody but i'm picking up the dish rag
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:22.400]  and i'm going to pop you and i go pop and you know it's just don't want to pop them too bad so
[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:26.480]  their guts splatter everywhere because big roach has guts in them i've done that quite a few times
[01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:32.480]  pop just to disable them get a rag grab and throw them in the trash or throw them in the toilet uh
[01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:36.160]  you know it's the same thing i'm not looking for a civil war i'm not looking for trouble here
[01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:40.800]  but cockroaches have got to be stepped on cockroaches have got to be taken out
[01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:47.200]  and we're doing that politically with the info war and i only bring you things that we believe
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:51.600]  are the very best and that i've had dramatic results other people have had a dramatic results
[01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:56.160]  plus that's good business anyways where you get a great response i was blown away and then i'm
[01:38:56.160 --> 01:39:01.280]  going to go to your calls and shove about this but this is my philosophy when i was promoting
[01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:06.320]  high-quality nutraceuticals for a long time and i decided that i wanted to get into it myself
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:14.960]  and so i went and sought out major manufacturers major facilities and labs to produce
[01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:19.280]  and they were always blown away they said the highest quality companies out there
[01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:26.480]  if they sell something for 50 bucks it costs them 10 most people spend a dollar on the contents
[01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:31.760]  30 cents on the bottle and they sell it for 50 bucks it's all marketing and they hire the best
[01:39:31.760 --> 01:39:40.000]  looking models or have the best pitch people you're going to put 45 dollars of product in
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:44.320]  something you're going to sell for 130 well that's still like almost double markup yeah
[01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:51.200]  that's how we fund our operation you're going to sell something for 50 bucks that has 20
[01:39:51.200 --> 01:40:05.680]  dollars of product in it yeah this stuff is the lamborghini kuntosh of supplements at a
[01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:12.800]  Ford LTD price that's my guarantee to you just try it i want to warn you it took me a while to
[01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:19.040]  build up supermodality uh tolerance first i took half a dose now i take a full dose
[01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:24.880]  and i catch myself taking a little bit more than a full dose so this stuff isn't a joke it's not a
[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:33.600]  game info wars life.com or 888-253-3139 and then just phenomenal products when you purchase them

[01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:18.160]  plug last hour so i kind of double plugged there no matter how good these calls are i got a bunch
[01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:23.600]  of clips and a bunch of news i want to get to i'm going to go to kevin betsey benjamin
[01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:33.360]  jim john matt john adam joel and others and then i'm done with calls until i get to all the news
[01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:38.480]  we have a special guest joining us in studio kevin booth bill hicks is former producer but
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:45.360]  he's better known for producing award-winning documentaries on showtime hbo um you name it
[01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:49.200]  american drug war one and two and others he's here to interview me for a film he's making
[01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:54.480]  about oligarchs worldwide he's going to be over in europe and stuff but kill two birds with one
[01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:59.520]  stone he'll be here my former manager i am bill hicks i'm being sarcastic i'm actually a clone
[01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:07.600]  between um elvis pressley and john wane so if you really want to get into conspiracy theories
[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:16.480]  i'm a reptoid clone of john wane uh and elvis not of bill hicks okay let's just get that clear
[01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:22.000]  yes ladies you don't want even texas monthly asked am i bill hicks and i mean i might look
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:28.320]  like a third cousin or something i just don't get it but i know someone that produced some albums
[01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:36.000]  with him kind of like i live in austin texas so therefore i must be secretly working for the
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:43.920]  university of texas well i know it's about fake conspiracy theories is they never go after real
[01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:50.560]  stuff like i've said i had family that worked multiple family members that work for the cia
[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:57.120]  i thrown stuff out like my family would do stuff like help east german defectors and i don't know
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:43:05.200]  the full detail of that or uh you know i had family that did black hop missions in the army
[01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:10.960]  me no one ever goes up with that and says see he's cia he admitted it because then it's not fun
[01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:16.880]  you've got to make something up because then it's like your new creation it's like you you made a
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:23.360]  new world of bs want to make something clear here cast sunstein at the white house said six years ago
[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:30.480]  they would discredit real media by creating outlandish theories to discredit questioning the system
[01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:36.320]  and some can say i do that i mean i get wild sometimes but i think that's real people resonate
[01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:41.120]  with it and it gets people thinking you got to get folks out of their trance first all right let's
[01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:45.120]  go to these calls then i've got the mi6 chief saying prepare for terror attacks and all the rest of
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:53.360]  it uh kevin and nova scotia you're on the air we are going to these calls quick aren't we kevin go
[01:43:53.360 --> 01:44:01.680]  ahead hi alex um you're lucky you're in austin today because i'm in hella fax and it's as cold
[01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:08.560]  as david rocketfeller's heart up here wow that's cold that is cold um i had an interesting fact
[01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:12.640]  to share with you and your viewers and then i had a quick question for you if that's okay yes sir
[01:44:14.080 --> 01:44:22.000]  there was a ship wreck uh off the coast of texas somewhere in the gulf of mexico in 1685
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:29.680]  the ship was owned by louis the 14th the ship was called love bell and on board they had a lot of
[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:38.560]  treasures that belonged to the jesuit order in roam and in one of those boxes there was
[01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:49.120]  a whole bunch of gold rings and on the gold rings was the number 9 11 in roman numerals so
[01:44:49.120 --> 01:45:01.680]  i x x i which is pretty fascinating i think and my question to you is is it possible that david
[01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:09.040]  rocketfeller and the rough child and the bush family and all of the crazy things that are going
[01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:17.760]  on in the world could it all be that these guys are working for the jesuit order in roam i don't
[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:23.280]  think so i think the globalist through every major institution have a philosophy of world
[01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:28.720]  government a philosophy of socialism to condition and social engineer and that's all building towards
[01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:36.160]  a technocracy really today uh it is a eugenesis cult uh that rules all the major former secret
[01:45:36.160 --> 01:45:41.280]  societies but we did look up that ship that i guess they have part of it at the bob bullet museum
[01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:45.520]  here in austin i don't even know that i ought to take my kids down there that's fascinating thank
[01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:52.720]  you so much for the call um let's go to another caller here let's talk to benjamin in portland
[01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:59.840]  oregon he wants to comment on the connection of gangster rap and jihad i just continually see it
[01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:04.960]  pop up and nobody seems to tie it together uh go ahead your take on that how you doing brother
[01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:11.760]  alec this is benjamin uh i'm also a close friend of ricky rough the person friend of mine i also
[01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:18.480]  got locked up in the 80s with the crack epidemic in the 80s and uh i just see what you've been
[01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:25.040]  saying man i talked to rick periodically from time to time and uh i see what you're saying about the uh
[01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:35.360]  how they're tying the rap music to this jihadism and uh i was watching the uh
[01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:38.480]  news the other day and i've seen what they was talking about the people who did the shooting
[01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:43.360]  in paris and how they went to a club with these guys dancing in the streets doing like a little
[01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:50.640]  video or whatnot and then when you do turn on mtv you see all the uh gangster rap so it's a tie-in
[01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:55.600]  and uh i just want to you know i'm just happy man that we got men like you men and try to
[01:46:55.600 --> 01:46:59.600]  expose this thing i'm trying my best to educate people i'm standing up with rick
[01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:04.640]  just try to stay on point with what's going on man i love what you do well god bless you my
[01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:10.080]  brother and i tell you expanding on that that was a powerful video that uh the real rick ross did
[01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:14.800]  challenging the fake one where he called him out for it imagine what hip hop could do because the
[01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:21.520]  beats are great it's addictive i like a lot of the songs imagine what could be done if it was a
[01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:28.240]  force for good but mtv and others make sure that a lot of music that's a lot better but anti
[01:47:28.240 --> 01:47:33.920]  establishment never sees the light of day good to hear from you let's talk to uh john in texas
[01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:40.720]  texan texas just hung up john in texas you're on the year alex it's a pleasure to be on your show
[01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:45.440]  i want to say that first of all and i've been listening to you for a while and but i want to
[01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:50.160]  share a couple things with you and with you viewers uh if this may not believe that this
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:56.240]  stuff is really happening um i work i deliver to dollar general stores all over the state texas
[01:47:57.120 --> 01:48:01.840]  and the other day i was down at a store that literally right behind the store is the real
[01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:07.840]  grand river the border of the us of mexico and literally i'm seeing people running across the
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:12.560]  border and getting away with it i mean i'm seeing this this i i mean i heard about it on your show
[01:48:12.560 --> 01:48:17.440]  no here i've been down to the border i've shot video i was down at big bend a few years ago there
[01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:23.600]  was board patrol everywhere now it's just illegals just going right through getting in vans right there
[01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:29.040]  at the by the ranger station just driving into america mexico plates driving right through the
[01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:35.280]  border checkpoint 75 miles in and they wanted to search us and i was just like are you kidding
[01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:40.000]  and then the last time they just waved us through there is no border right now
[01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:48.960]  correct there's not um you know i know people that work with the border patrol and and stuff but um
[01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:54.720]  that's inside note but um i'm seeing it and i've seen them just walking across the border border
[01:48:54.720 --> 01:49:00.080]  patrol there not really doing anything about it and i'm just coming across the border now i drive
[01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:05.440]  truck and uh a few years ago i used to work for a company that used to take freight uh to canada
[01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:10.400]  and back quite a bit oh for me calling across the us border when you're a us citizen because i'm
[01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:16.880]  telling you they question you big time is a proctology exam when you're an american citizen you are
[01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:25.120]  treated like trash and it is incredible now i came through once this year into houston and the guy
[01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:29.680]  was a listener and he got so mad he said yeah i'm supposed to search you and do all this stuff to you
[01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:34.640]  and he goes man he goes it's harassment they do it to everybody they do it to congressman he he just
[01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:40.800]  said i'm not doing it and he stamped the thing and said you can go through uh but usually they go oh
[01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:46.160]  and they go uh we're directing you over here so yeah i mean it is it is such a joke because again
[01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:54.320]  the internal police state system is only for us it's sick isn't it yep and you know recently i
[01:49:54.320 --> 01:50:00.560]  i flew recently and i got pulled aside for the extra screening and i you know groping by the tsa it
[01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:05.840]  was just it was ridiculous i wasn't really happy about it uh you know it was crazy another thing
[01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:11.120]  i wanted to share with you uh today recently i i i was trying to get out of insurance quotes for
[01:50:11.120 --> 01:50:18.400]  my for my car and i called and was doing some quotes and you know they asked me for my name they

[02:03:22.240 --> 02:03:28.400]  yes about the adl the adl has had enough to be a communist Jewish organization they didn't support
[02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:32.160]  i like other just people like michael savage they totally ignored and they totally they
[02:03:32.160 --> 02:03:38.480]  be attack anyone you know also expected they they only support the far apart savage would be very
[02:03:38.480 --> 02:03:43.840]  critical of communist jewish organizations but i mean look look the adl is an organization
[02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:52.160]  meant to demonize anybody as a nazi who criticizes any democratic party operation basically and
[02:03:52.160 --> 02:03:56.560]  because it's effective to call somebody a nazi it's just they've done it so much to innocent
[02:03:56.560 --> 02:04:01.440]  people they've lost lawsuits they've been in court they've they've been caught breaking into police
[02:04:01.440 --> 02:04:06.400]  departments to get files the adl is in my opinion a jewish mafia organization

[02:08:25.600 --> 02:08:31.760]  we are back live transmitting worldwide on over a hundred and adaminathan affiliates global
[02:08:31.760 --> 02:08:41.200]  shortwave and the internet at info wars.com and prisonplanet.com all of you out there are vital
[02:08:41.200 --> 02:08:46.640]  components in the battle for human liberty the battle for freedom the battle for transparency
[02:08:46.640 --> 02:08:53.680]  the battle for family rights and values the battle for the right to self-defense all of those basic
[02:08:53.680 --> 02:09:01.600]  attacks are directed by the globalists to shut down human individual freedom it's all about
[02:09:01.600 --> 02:09:09.520]  collective forcing you into some gang or group that they can control well there are more of us
[02:09:09.520 --> 02:09:16.080]  that are nonconformist and basic classical humans that want to be free and want to associate in free
[02:09:16.080 --> 02:09:22.880]  society with other individuals but that don't want to be bullied by political correctness
[02:09:22.880 --> 02:09:29.520]  into their centralized systems and this broadcast is a declaration of information warfare
[02:09:30.320 --> 02:09:36.640]  the warheads we fire are truth our bias is telling the truth and standing for justice
[02:09:36.640 --> 02:09:43.840]  and not being cowards and telling to talitarians masquerading as the left that they can go straight
[02:09:43.840 --> 02:09:51.760]  to hades that the real enlightenment the real renaissance isn't about the left hand path or the
[02:09:51.760 --> 02:09:56.320]  right hand path left and right is very occultic ladies and gentlemen for those that don't know
[02:09:56.320 --> 02:10:03.280]  those terms have only been in use concerning masonry until about the last 150 years the left
[02:10:03.280 --> 02:10:09.680]  hand path the right hand path would masonry fall to satanism and the left hand path or following
[02:10:09.680 --> 02:10:16.800]  god and i'm that's a gestalt it's oversimplified but this is about the left hand rising above
[02:10:16.800 --> 02:10:25.840]  and for the left hand to rise above it has to overthrow the existing order well let me explain
[02:10:25.840 --> 02:10:30.240]  something i don't like kings and queens and the illuminati sold itself on claiming they would
[02:10:30.240 --> 02:10:37.840]  overthrow that and got good people to join them but not to make you kings not to create something
[02:10:37.840 --> 02:10:50.240]  new and even worse no no no anarchy is the road i'm on you can come along just be sure
[02:10:50.880 --> 02:10:59.840]  that it's what you want and you will be strong yes the left hand path is very sexy alluring
[02:10:59.840 --> 02:11:08.560]  quicker faster but not as fulfilling or powerful long term and it doesn't regenerate itself
[02:11:08.560 --> 02:11:17.600]  it doesn't live it doesn't empower masses it only empowers the very few to dominate in a kingdom of
[02:11:17.600 --> 02:11:29.680]  darkness if the brightest star we see is supposedly evil why does it produce such hell on earth
[02:11:32.800 --> 02:11:38.240]  the brightest star you see must always be thee
[02:11:38.240 --> 02:11:49.920]  again i'm using a little danzig poetry and an ode to the devil to illustrate that the devil
[02:11:51.360 --> 02:12:01.440]  is a control freak the devil claims he's there to empower there to free there to make you strong
[02:12:01.440 --> 02:12:07.440]  but into the scales i find the devil lacking
[02:12:10.720 --> 02:12:11.840]  and i know the devil
[02:12:16.160 --> 02:12:18.640]  we're gonna get into the news right now ladies and gentlemen
[02:12:22.080 --> 02:12:25.120]  let's cover it let's just start here
[02:12:25.120 --> 02:12:33.920]  here report drug cartel places 45 million dollar bounty on rick perry's head
[02:12:35.920 --> 02:12:41.760]  cartels previously set bounties on sheriff or pyro and border patrol agents really goes to
[02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:47.040]  i mean of course they got one on rick perry because he's the only governor that's actually
[02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:52.480]  tried to shut down a border and believe me folks perry's called me a big fat hog in public
[02:12:52.480 --> 02:12:58.000]  i guess i was a big fat hog and done a lot of other stuff i'm not going to get into but i mean
[02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:02.560]  when he's in when he's right he's right so i just i just go with the facts so that they really don't
[02:13:02.560 --> 02:13:10.720]  like him i was told something about this by state senator two years ago but then through some sources
[02:13:10.720 --> 02:13:17.840]  we then made some calls and this is indeed going on a mexican drug cartel reportedly placed a 45
[02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:23.440]  million dollar bounty on former texas governor rick perry but when he was governor prompting
[02:13:23.440 --> 02:13:28.720]  heavy security around the governor a political insider said the insider who is deep within
[02:13:28.720 --> 02:13:33.120]  republican politics shed an unusual number of black clad heavily armed state troopers are
[02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:37.520]  escorting perry to speeches and other public events such as the recent dinner in south carolina
[02:13:39.920 --> 02:13:42.640]  what's he gonna do when that security's off of him he's not governor anymore
[02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:48.320]  my state representative we just got this info on monday we've been working on since then was
[02:13:48.320 --> 02:13:53.600]  just at dinner with with rick perry and observing the usual amount of security so he asked around
[02:13:53.600 --> 02:13:58.720]  and found out that perry has a 45 million dollar bounty on his head from a mexican cartel you know
[02:13:58.720 --> 02:14:02.960]  that were told that by the state police he said they had been trying to keep it quiet for obvious
[02:14:02.960 --> 02:14:10.160]  reasons but the security is humongous when reached for comment perry's press secretary lucy nasher
[02:14:10.160 --> 02:14:14.800]  did confirm the dinner but referred security questions the texas department of public safety
[02:14:14.800 --> 02:14:20.320]  which then conducted contact refused to give specifics see they should have just denied it
[02:14:20.320 --> 02:14:27.120]  it's it's true folks as we made some other calls i made some little little ring of dingy's cartels
[02:14:27.120 --> 02:14:33.520]  place several multi-million dollar bounties on sheriff or pyos head over the past several years
[02:14:34.320 --> 02:14:39.440]  and the democrats criticized that he had two two two bodyguards you don't have like 15
[02:14:39.440 --> 02:14:44.320]  and they also routinely set bounties on board patrol agents ranging from 250 000 to 2 million
[02:14:44.320 --> 02:14:49.360]  and some of them have been killed perry previously called the cartels drug gangs narco terrorist
[02:14:50.720 --> 02:14:54.320]  what we were seeing on our board was nothing short of a war being waged by these narco terrorists
[02:14:54.320 --> 02:15:00.160]  perry told the audience they represent a clear and present danger in response he spearheaded a rapid
[02:15:00.160 --> 02:15:06.240]  deployment of state law enforcement see that's obama pulled them off so perry at least has them
[02:15:06.240 --> 02:15:10.480]  run through databases and then has to release them if they're not criminals the problem is the feds
[02:15:10.480 --> 02:15:17.040]  then just release them but for that they want him dead oh man the federal government is just sick
[02:15:17.040 --> 02:15:21.040]  i mean not the actual board patrol agents they're as horrified as we are they say quote we're
[02:15:21.040 --> 02:15:25.920]  completing the smuggling process in response he spearheaded a rapid deployment of state law
[02:15:25.920 --> 02:15:30.080]  enforcement agencies across the border which filled the gaps lit by board patrol after the
[02:15:30.080 --> 02:15:33.520]  white house ordered the agency to stand down from enforcing immigration and driving in loss
[02:15:33.520 --> 02:15:37.200]  and then it goes into how they're heavily outnumbered and they're getting shot and everything
[02:15:37.760 --> 02:15:45.840]  so there you go that's the country we live in ladies and gentlemen breaking an info wars.com
[02:15:46.960 --> 02:15:53.280]  let's just go through this stack right now 21 pages of obama care tax instructions irs demands
[02:15:53.280 --> 02:15:58.320]  shared responsibility for payment and says it's in their prerogative of course whether they're
[02:15:58.320 --> 02:16:03.680]  going to start garnishing wages grabbing bank accounts or holding back tax returns there's
[02:16:03.680 --> 02:16:08.800]  they promised you that wouldn't happen this is a government under obama that ships guns
[02:16:08.800 --> 02:16:12.320]  of the mexican drug cartels you think they're going to gang rape you oh yeah
[02:16:15.360 --> 02:16:21.440]  is treasurer island about pirates momentum builds in congress for raising the federal
[02:16:21.440 --> 02:16:26.000]  gas tax to the hill oh since the prices are down how about a federal gas tax increase
[02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:30.480]  and how about new carbon taxes that's being pushed everywhere told you that was coming
[02:16:30.480 --> 02:16:38.640]  because it's the season of raping everyone it's the time of the season to get raped because you'd
[02:16:38.640 --> 02:16:50.720]  like to lay down yay yay yay a nation of sheep will be ruled by what wolves oh woofies i thought
[02:16:50.720 --> 02:16:56.400]  groveling got me ahead in life no there's a reason lions eat gazelles and tigers eat little little
[02:16:56.400 --> 02:17:01.040]  deer because they don't have big teeth and fight back and if humans ever started rolling over and
[02:17:01.040 --> 02:17:07.600]  showing their bellies or running from lions or tigers they'd start eating us what do you think
[02:17:07.600 --> 02:17:14.640]  a lion does in africa when even two or three humans walk over a hill it hauls but and it did that
[02:17:14.640 --> 02:17:18.720]  before there were even guns on the continent recorded 500 years ago because humans when
[02:17:18.720 --> 02:17:24.400]  motivated are more deadly than a lion or a tiger but nowadays lions and tigers do eat people because
[02:17:24.400 --> 02:17:29.280]  africans have been domesticated just like we have here in america wolves now come up and
[02:17:29.280 --> 02:17:36.720]  grab people off their front porches because we are now prey animals trained by the upper class
[02:17:36.720 --> 02:17:43.840]  to be their food well i'm not your food and i still got my guns and i know the enemy is
[02:17:43.840 --> 02:17:50.400]  dumb you haven't chopped my wavos off yet
[02:17:52.640 --> 02:17:59.040]  it's kind of poignant i said that they got a hell of a paper cut bad omen experts warn of
[02:17:59.040 --> 02:18:04.800]  governments to plan for climate change of migrants we have to open the borders up the third world's
[02:18:04.800 --> 02:18:10.480]  collapsing because of climate change writers reports not because the imf and world bank arms of the
[02:18:10.480 --> 02:18:15.120]  fellow reserve are raping them signing them on to debts and aren't theirs
[02:18:17.680 --> 02:18:19.040]  see how we decipher the news
[02:18:21.440 --> 02:18:25.920]  hillary furis over bill's part in latest sex scandal oh with the pedophile
[02:18:28.320 --> 02:18:31.120]  sure glorial style will probably come out and defend that one she defended him with all the
[02:18:31.120 --> 02:18:37.120]  rape allegations that he's settled and i don't mean some chicks drunk and claim she got raped
[02:18:37.120 --> 02:18:44.160]  i mean i'm talking brutalizing women that's what's liberal though it makes it okay if you're liberal
[02:18:46.240 --> 02:18:49.760]  they're now hyping a new cyber pearl harbor you know be launched for the globalist where they'll
[02:18:49.760 --> 02:18:55.680]  open the door to outside attacks burn a few patsies obama proposed two free years of community
[02:18:55.680 --> 02:18:59.840]  college for students but they got a sign on degree to more which just means the debt so now they got
[02:18:59.840 --> 02:19:05.200]  to use money to induce people to go get degrees that'll be worth less than toilet paper because
[02:19:05.200 --> 02:19:09.680]  at least you can wipe your heiny with toilet paper you can line a bird cage you know with
[02:19:09.680 --> 02:19:15.600]  newspapers they've got some use if you got a cockatoo or african gray or maybe a maybe a macaw
[02:19:15.600 --> 02:19:22.000]  or something i don't know tweety birds canaries i don't know obama didn't have any canaries he

[02:35:14.560 --> 02:35:19.680]  frickin worn well that's why they got to get all those carbon taxes you know that will fit well

[02:35:48.720 --> 02:35:52.640]  i should be happy because the price of gas is so great but well that's why they're doing it now
[02:35:52.640 --> 02:35:57.760]  they're sneaking it all in when it's low exactly just in time for me to buy a prius how are you
[02:35:57.760 --> 02:36:03.120]  gonna like it then when they jack up prices later uh i don't want to get my battery car that runs on
[02:36:03.120 --> 02:36:07.280]  coal i'm just gonna fill the bag that actually uses more carbon than the other one i know the old
[02:36:07.280 --> 02:36:11.600]  people electric cars they look down on you then you and then the regular car that gets good gas
[02:36:11.600 --> 02:36:16.240]  mileage is better than their car yeah that's i think volts look great but i'm tired of like yuppies
[02:36:16.240 --> 02:36:20.720]  looking down at me that i have a truck when their volt uses more carbon than i do well it only goes
[02:36:20.720 --> 02:36:28.720]  30 miles for it runs on gas anyway they're good looking cars i would buy a volt if it had a v10
[02:36:28.720 --> 02:36:32.960]  under the hood teslas are cool just to say you know what to al gore a middle finger i'm thinking
[02:36:32.960 --> 02:36:41.520]  about getting a hellcat 707 horsepower how about a nice hummer a tank already got a big uh i already

[02:36:50.080 --> 02:36:54.960]  it like three and a half years ago nobody got them did you get rid of the dodge uh yes you're
[02:36:54.960 --> 02:36:59.200]  rid of the dodge i had it like seven years this is a great car but you know i sped too much in it
[02:36:59.920 --> 02:37:05.040]  the car went 200 i miss alex here i haven't been off this is my first time to be in austin in years
[02:37:05.680 --> 02:37:10.160]  this is nice being back out at your dad's old ranch yeah back at the old ranch in fredericksburg
[02:37:10.160 --> 02:37:15.040]  for bill hicks had so many good times yep we used to trip all the time and had all our experiences
[02:37:15.040 --> 02:37:20.800]  back during the day no it really is insulting to bill hicks for people to try to steal his identity
[02:37:20.800 --> 02:37:26.000]  and project it on to me it's strange you know my brother was schizophrenic he was nine years older
[02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:30.480]  and he had a thing where he would project people's personalities on other people in fact he thought he
[02:37:30.480 --> 02:37:35.200]  was this other guy for many many years and so after bill passed away and people used to say
[02:37:35.840 --> 02:37:40.160]  alex looks just like bill i would i would i don't think alex looks anything like bill
[02:37:40.160 --> 02:37:44.240]  and i think it was just talk from that that started some guy got a guy on my facebook page claiming
[02:37:44.240 --> 02:37:48.880]  he's the one that started the conspiracy and then then we joked about it a few times and took off from
[02:37:48.880 --> 02:37:54.160]  there well i mean he was from texas and he could look like a second cousin
[02:37:56.000 --> 02:38:01.280]  but it's just crazy i've had people three or four times supposed to be like in restaurants
[02:38:01.280 --> 02:38:05.040]  the three go bill bill and i don't respond they go oh it's just checking like i'm going to turn
[02:38:05.040 --> 02:38:08.720]  around when they say bill well i mean i get crazy people on the internet making these videos but
[02:38:08.720 --> 02:38:13.600]  when texas monthly then puts it out there and they they actually choose the craziest of all the videos
[02:38:13.600 --> 02:38:17.280]  to to promote and if you go i don't know if you've looked at some of the other videos that those people
[02:38:17.280 --> 02:38:22.160]  may but they they uh they can also speak to dead babies and they do they have a lot of other magical
[02:38:22.160 --> 02:38:30.800]  power i don't have time yeah i did a little research on the people that made the video
[02:38:33.040 --> 02:38:38.320]  so let's not show too much of it folks it's just ridiculous because they're so nuts they'll
[02:38:38.880 --> 02:38:42.640]  they'll they'll claim copyright on videos claiming i'm bill hicks i might even like to defend myself
[02:38:42.640 --> 02:38:49.680]  well seriously though i am the son of john wane yeah that'd be cool yeah no my dad's accent you're
[02:38:49.680 --> 02:38:55.120]  all into the whole texas thing right yeah not from ohio like john wane but you fought for the
[02:38:55.120 --> 02:39:01.600]  for the texas republic right i did have ancestors enough about me actually i am debbie crock had
[02:39:01.600 --> 02:39:06.960]  reincarnated yes now now we're the new york times play run with that i'm joking this is satire folks

[02:39:35.360 --> 02:39:38.880]  it's launched a lot i've seen a lot of other documentaries i used to get offended when people
[02:39:38.880 --> 02:39:43.600]  steal your ideas but i think just like music or anything else when you see other documentaries
[02:39:43.600 --> 02:39:47.600]  coming out and they're using the same exact ideas and everything like that's well i consulted on it
[02:39:47.600 --> 02:39:52.240]  and then i got too busy to come out to la to finish it with you i'm really bummed that i
[02:39:52.240 --> 02:39:58.320]  didn't come finish the film with you just like rusa wanted me in his uh freedom to fascism i was
[02:39:58.320 --> 02:40:02.400]  just too busy yeah i should have done that oh that's why i'm here today to be in your film you're
[02:40:02.400 --> 02:40:07.680]  here that's right your secret film yeah we're working on a new new top secret film uh it has
[02:40:07.680 --> 02:40:13.760]  to do with how the history of the world has been molded by rigged elections and staged elections
[02:40:14.320 --> 02:40:19.920]  but this time uh we're actually going to be going over to the former soviet union and spending some
[02:40:19.920 --> 02:40:26.240]  time over in a uh in bulgaria and some other places over there we have a new headquarters and some
[02:40:26.240 --> 02:40:31.680]  inside ways to get some some uh footage and interviews and stuff that i never would have
[02:40:31.680 --> 02:40:35.520]  been able to get before we got kind of a new stronghold over there and a whole situation
[02:40:35.520 --> 02:40:42.240]  when we've got security detail and a whole bit it's going to be pretty cool it sounds like you
[02:40:42.240 --> 02:40:47.600]  were doing vice tarts type stuff at ten years before they existed yeah going into dangerous
[02:40:47.600 --> 02:40:52.400]  third world countries going into skid row going into talking to the drug dealers and so i guess
[02:40:52.400 --> 02:40:57.440]  you're going back to your roots this is pretty exciting investigating dictatorships is not a
[02:40:57.440 --> 02:41:03.360]  very safe thing i know i know but i'm glad we're sending you to the front i'll stay here
[02:41:03.360 --> 02:41:12.880]  here in the rear with the gear i went to war is for like four hours got in and got out real fast
[02:41:12.880 --> 02:41:18.240]  no but you went in actually to the drug areas yeah you know much yeah yeah now it uh you know
[02:41:19.040 --> 02:41:22.880]  it's uh it's going to be it's going to be serious i mean this story has been told before obviously
[02:41:22.880 --> 02:41:26.880]  by you several times but hopefully it's good what's going to be different this time is that we're
[02:41:26.880 --> 02:41:32.400]  going to be able to to go into like i said former soviet union and tell it from that perspective
[02:41:32.400 --> 02:41:37.760]  so it's going to be an american perspective told from a russian story it's going to be but none
[02:41:37.760 --> 02:41:41.840]  of that matters the drug war doesn't matter what oligarchs are doing don't matter it's just
[02:41:42.720 --> 02:41:48.960]  you are actually jim orison i'm going to start that here today that you staged your death at
[02:41:48.960 --> 02:41:54.880]  28 in paris or was it 27 and you are jim orison jim how did you come out with those first few
[02:41:54.880 --> 02:41:59.280]  albums you're just a genius i've always been such a fan of you since i was a little kid listen to
[02:41:59.280 --> 02:42:05.520]  your music uh we were just looking to open the doors of perception now did you get that from
[02:42:05.520 --> 02:42:14.240]  huxley mr morrison uh that's a huxley statement yeah that one doors of perception uh i mean i know
[02:42:14.240 --> 02:42:17.920]  jim orison talked about the doors of perception yeah you know my brother actually got hit over the
[02:42:17.920 --> 02:42:22.560]  head with a coke bottle at a doors concert so i was actually in los angeles during that whole
[02:42:22.560 --> 02:42:28.000]  you knocked your brother over the head jim morrison's brother i got another funny story from that
[02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:32.400]  day i actually when i was a little kid i rode my bike to where the manson ranch was out on the side
[02:42:32.400 --> 02:42:37.680]  side of la when that was going on yeah when that was going on actually some crazy you know
[02:42:37.680 --> 02:42:44.320]  it's kind of like a maybe you're the son of charlie manson that that could be from uh from who
[02:42:44.320 --> 02:42:49.600]  was the guy from the beach boys trey and i we we had an idea for a restaurant in hollywood we
[02:42:49.600 --> 02:42:55.360]  want to call it the last supper where we we have all the the whole menu is uh all the famous last
[02:42:55.360 --> 02:42:59.600]  uppers from everybody we want to have like the sharing tape meal and and uh sharing tape was so
[02:42:59.600 --> 02:43:04.480]  gorgeous man yeah what a crime to gut her yeah we just went to that property the other day
[02:43:04.480 --> 02:43:09.360]  and they they changed the address they bulldozed down the house and they changed the address by one
[02:43:09.360 --> 02:43:13.600]  number i'm really against war because it chews up women yeah if you go back to shelver we just
[02:43:13.600 --> 02:43:23.600]  leave the women alone take care of them hey seriously um again my old buddy kevin booth
[02:43:23.600 --> 02:43:28.400]  i've known you since 1994 so when i was first getting around access 95 yeah bill had just died
[02:43:28.960 --> 02:43:33.920]  i had just staged my death yeah at the time bill was here in austin working on several projects
[02:43:33.920 --> 02:43:37.920]  we were actually working on a project that was called the virtual tonight show for australian
[02:43:37.920 --> 02:43:41.920]  tv where we were going to do the thing about branch to video and we had he was being offered
[02:43:41.920 --> 02:43:46.080]  national tv shows he'd done one in england all this stuff but he'd rather stage his death and
[02:43:46.080 --> 02:43:49.920]  become elixir well we had a we had a thing where he was we were doing a gag where you remember
[02:43:49.920 --> 02:43:53.520]  remember the cows that were around the branch to video compound yes we're going to do a gag where bill
[02:43:53.520 --> 02:43:57.120]  was going to be one of the cows that was out there by branch to video and and he was like
[02:43:57.120 --> 02:44:01.120]  using that to get close to the compound but during that whole time coming and going you
[02:44:01.120 --> 02:44:06.880]  were just starting on public access tv and you were this young guy that sat in front of the star map
[02:44:06.880 --> 02:44:11.840]  and yeah i couldn't really tell what you were rambling about but it was kind of magnetic and
[02:44:11.840 --> 02:44:17.360]  actually bill wrote a script about it was called public access where there was a main character
[02:44:17.360 --> 02:44:24.640]  kind of loosely based on you named on arturo that he was going to play so he actually wrote a script
[02:44:24.640 --> 02:44:29.120]  the main character there's the proof how i did it how i began all the shows yeah well you'll
[02:44:29.120 --> 02:44:33.920]  separately i got to know him become good friends with uh mike judge and i'd heard this from people
[02:44:33.920 --> 02:44:37.920]  that knew him rick linklater and stuff as he produced the first beavis and bud hedge and
[02:44:37.920 --> 02:44:43.280]  then some of the king of the hills out of the studios of rick linklater deter films it wasn't
[02:44:43.280 --> 02:44:48.560]  a deter deter films production he just did it there and i've been told by linklater and tell me
[02:44:48.560 --> 02:44:51.680]  pilota that oh yeah some of that was based on access well then i get to know him good but i've
[02:44:51.680 --> 02:44:56.240]  known him a few years he goes oh by the way when i was interviewing him so he goes by the way
[02:44:56.240 --> 02:45:00.960]  you're partially based on hank hill and gribble and we'd always sat around joe he said no i've
[02:45:00.960 --> 02:45:06.880]  got a tape around here that's got your show with two guests saying you know the the uh the uh the
[02:45:06.880 --> 02:45:10.640]  three dales right well you know it's funny about that i'm actually working with johnny hardwick
[02:45:10.640 --> 02:45:16.880]  right now oh really awesome yeah he's a character he's a classic yeah we're doing a uh that's another
[02:45:16.880 --> 02:45:22.000]  thing that's that's a comedic show as a unscripted by the way of a new listener tune in that sounds
[02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:26.320]  like crazy boasting can you guys play the bill the uh not the bill hicks the uh mike judge
[02:45:26.320 --> 02:45:29.360]  intro for the show here in a minute queue that up and just just play it whenever you're ready
[02:45:30.080 --> 02:45:34.720]  let hank hill introduce the show right the reason i'm talking about this is it shows the power of
[02:45:34.720 --> 02:45:40.400]  individuals i was on access tv a few years had no idea that all these hollywood people are already
[02:45:40.400 --> 02:45:46.000]  writing scripts doing movies coming up with tv shows and i was influencing now the influence
[02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:52.320]  we've confirmed captain america you name it from this show winter soldier so many other movies it's
[02:45:52.320 --> 02:45:57.440]  incredible video games this show is having such a huge effect it's not a testament to alex jones
[02:45:57.440 --> 02:46:01.840]  i think it's for the guest and now just just the open debate here kevin yeah no and it's your
[02:46:01.840 --> 02:46:06.480]  hard work i mean that's why when people hit on you and and i always get in situations especially
[02:46:06.480 --> 02:46:10.000]  you know in the marijuana field where i get around people all the time that are going oh when you're
[02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:13.760]  with alex you got to tell him he needs to do this and he's to stop doing that and he's to stop doing
[02:46:13.760 --> 02:46:18.080]  that and the one thing i always say about you when i'm sticking up for you and i have to stick up for
[02:46:18.080 --> 02:46:24.320]  you a lot don't know why i don't know why i'm constantly defending you is that uh i say well
[02:46:24.320 --> 02:46:27.920]  first of all if you don't like alex change a channel right it's called freedom of speech check
[02:46:27.920 --> 02:46:33.360]  it out everybody believed in it or i thought i thought you did too and alex is just being himself
[02:46:33.360 --> 02:46:37.680]  and you know maybe you just can't help the fact that he got there with hard work and i mean you
[02:46:37.680 --> 02:46:42.080]  have alex is a hard working guy you are a hard working guy a lot harder working than me
[02:46:42.080 --> 02:46:45.360]  no kevin well you're a lot more talented at filmmaking but enough about me i'm boring enough
[02:46:45.360 --> 02:46:49.040]  about bill hicks like is it kind of because at first i said hey let's talk about some of the
[02:46:49.040 --> 02:46:52.720]  bill hicks stuff and you've got some of the documents and clips and i said no kevin let's
[02:46:52.720 --> 02:46:57.040]  just get into what you're doing but i know it's top secret talk about sacred cow productions talk
[02:46:57.040 --> 02:47:01.280]  about what it's like out there working in that industry now because we heard the mayor announced
[02:47:01.280 --> 02:47:07.360]  that hollywood's collapsing right now uh are you seeing that uh not from my point of view i mean
[02:47:07.360 --> 02:47:10.800]  i'm i'm having because you're what's collapsing hollywood the new blood even though you've been
[02:47:10.800 --> 02:47:15.840]  doing this 30 years you're the new blood out there i hope so leaner meaner yeah i hope so i mean
[02:47:15.840 --> 02:47:19.760]  hopefully it's a new a new age coming out there you know we're also also working on another
[02:47:19.760 --> 02:47:23.680]  documentary that's going to be more of a fun thing about you know another pot doc i can't get
[02:47:23.680 --> 02:47:28.480]  away from the marijuana thing but uh i had another story i was going to tell you about i'm friends
[02:47:28.480 --> 02:47:34.320]  with a guy that bought a prison outside of denver you've heard of this guy he maybe this guy actually
[02:47:34.320 --> 02:47:39.120]  bought an entire prison and he's going to turn into a marijuana grow operation and that's pretty
[02:47:39.120 --> 02:47:44.400]  pretty amazing and talk about returning the favor yeah no and uh colorado's fighting against it i
[02:47:44.400 --> 02:47:49.280]  don't know if you've heard now about the the lawsuit that the oklahoma is launching on colorado
[02:47:49.280 --> 02:47:52.960]  because of everybody bringing pot over the border and that's like their new proof that marijuana is
[02:47:52.960 --> 02:47:58.640]  bad and well obviously it can be used to excess but they didn't control alcohol outlawing it
[02:47:58.640 --> 02:48:02.320]  it made it more plentiful and corrupted the police you've got to decriminalize well what's
[02:48:02.320 --> 02:48:08.720]  crazy though is that right now there's over 130 publicly traded marijuana companies and uh it's
[02:48:08.720 --> 02:48:13.920]  funny because you're seeing this new form of corruption coming into the marijuana industry
[02:48:13.920 --> 02:48:20.000]  using the marijuana industry to do kind of these wall street type trading deals it's a it's a whole
[02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:24.080]  new level of scam taking yeah there's a lot of pump and dumps all these penny stocks i'm actually
[02:48:24.080 --> 02:48:28.880]  in conversation with jordan belford too you know we talked to we talked to jordan he's a
[02:48:28.880 --> 02:48:32.800]  listener yeah did you tell you that i didn't know you talked to him well he said he'd come on
[02:48:32.800 --> 02:48:37.440]  months ago and never did but you know you know who that's the wolf of wall street you know who's
[02:48:37.440 --> 02:48:41.920]  in prison with right yeah yeah with tommy chung yeah so he was actually there when i interviewed
[02:48:41.920 --> 02:48:45.280]  tommy in prison so it's pretty well will you please get him on the show okay all right

[02:56:03.200 --> 02:56:08.880]  that the most interesting thing about what happened just with this new thing is uh how now we've got
[02:56:08.880 --> 02:56:13.200]  bill marr and john stewart basically jumping in there and it seems like this this new little
[02:56:13.200 --> 02:56:20.320]  round is really invigorated the the liberals to to jump into this deal to like the the fight well
[02:56:20.320 --> 02:56:24.640]  yeah obama is now acting like he defends free speech when he attacked these cartoonists two years

[02:57:05.360 --> 02:57:09.840]  doesn't she yeah a little bit yeah so she's a little older we cross her with feinstein

[02:57:17.840 --> 02:57:19.360]  this show's taking a new twist
[02:57:22.400 --> 02:57:27.920]  i always come on here thinking i know what i'm gonna talk about jeez oh my god mark cornkey
[02:57:27.920 --> 02:57:32.880]  used to describe jen and rino which he was attorney general anybody's worked on a farm has seen this
[02:57:32.880 --> 02:57:37.120]  a cow dies or a horse dies the night possums like to eat what's in their lower intestine
[02:57:37.120 --> 02:57:42.880]  so a possum will crawl in and when you catch him he said he said jen and rino always look
[02:57:42.880 --> 02:57:46.880]  like a possum with that look on its face when it comes out of an animal's very end
[02:57:47.920 --> 02:57:52.880]  so i was plagiarizing mark cornkey there but that's a sincere form of flattery
