[00:00.000 --> 00:26.040]  Crashing through the lives and disinformation it's Alex Jones
[00:30.000 --> 00:54.020]  20 days 20 days and the tidal wave of total censorship has gone into insane
[00:54.020 --> 01:00.840]  overdrive unbelievable information coming up Facebook Twitter you name it are
[01:00.840 --> 01:06.280]  banning tens of thousands of pages of anyone that promotes the MPC memes
[01:06.280 --> 01:12.240]  which simply takes a gray face and puts it over the face of conformist
[01:12.240 --> 01:20.200]  authoritarian leftist thinkers in THX 1138 it's really a remake of the idea of
[01:20.200 --> 01:27.840]  a brave new world the scientific dictatorship they resemble MPC memes in
[01:27.840 --> 01:32.880]  the famous 10 minutes of hate from 1984 they wear gray uniforms and most people
[01:32.880 --> 01:37.720]  have shaved heads to be conformist I mean in every art type this is the image
[01:37.720 --> 01:44.000]  that's used of cults of controlled populations of prisoners of brainwashing
[01:44.000 --> 01:54.120]  of POWs and now they're trying to ban it everywhere in 1984 Apple had a Super Bowl
[01:54.120 --> 01:59.480]  ad that is still regarded at major universities and in ad schools as the
[01:59.480 --> 02:06.440]  most popular and famous television ad of all time and it shows faceless people
[02:06.440 --> 02:14.800]  that look exactly like MPC memes gray skin gray uniforms all subserviently
[02:14.800 --> 02:25.960]  chanting the same mindless garbage and today would Twitter ban the 1984 Apple
[02:25.960 --> 02:32.280]  computer ad with the image of the goddess alive with her blonde hair and her
[02:32.280 --> 02:37.080]  red shorts and her white shirt and her full breast bringing life back to the
[02:37.080 --> 02:44.800]  internet bringing life to the PC tyranny but now you have the Apple tyranny
[02:44.800 --> 02:48.560]  you have the Google tyranny and they have become what they claim they were
[02:48.560 --> 02:54.080]  fighting oh then they were revolutionaries in 1984 Steve Jobs saw the
[02:54.080 --> 02:59.280]  parallel of the authoritarian 1984 and the 10 minutes of hate and the PC
[02:59.280 --> 03:04.560]  dictatorship of international business machines and Bill Gates and he came and
[03:04.560 --> 03:08.800]  he smashed it only becomes something far worse than he'd said but if you look
[03:08.800 --> 03:12.320]  at the MPC memes if you're a radio listener TV listener haven't seen them
[03:12.320 --> 03:16.720]  that they're up on info wars.com it's something very telling they've gone
[03:16.720 --> 03:19.560]  from just a few months ago denying that they were censoring conservatives and
[03:19.560 --> 03:25.360]  libertarians and anything successful anything viral by calling it Nazi or
[03:25.360 --> 03:28.720]  calling it homophobic and they never even show what it was they said was
[03:28.720 --> 03:31.440]  homophobic as if you don't have free speech to be homophobic but they would
[03:31.440 --> 03:36.440]  lie and say you were when you weren't. New York Times admits memes are tools of
[03:36.440 --> 03:41.440]  influence as Twitter drops ban hammer and then it shows the New York Times
[03:41.440 --> 03:46.800]  screenshot what is an MPC the pro-trump internet new favorite insult. Twitter has
[03:46.800 --> 03:53.240]  barred hundreds of right-wing accounts it's thousands now for posting soulless
[03:53.240 --> 03:58.040]  non-playable liberal activities. So if you make fun of the tyranny of the
[03:58.040 --> 04:02.560]  censors the tyranny of the colleges the tyranny of the thought police which is
[04:02.560 --> 04:08.040]  completely admitted the New York Times says we're banning you and they
[04:08.040 --> 04:13.160]  praise Twitter and others for banning people's accounts because they simply
[04:13.160 --> 04:18.600]  post joke memes calling it dehumanization. Isn't that total inversion?
[04:18.600 --> 04:24.120]  Isn't that rich? The the MPC meme is showing the dehumanization like the book
[04:24.120 --> 04:33.280]  1984 or the movie 1984 or the movie THX 1138 or the Apple commercial in 1984.
[04:33.280 --> 04:38.400]  Think about that ladies and gentlemen think about the unbelievable irony of
[04:38.400 --> 04:43.640]  these authoritarians but I'm here to tell you any symbol that people sees on to
[04:43.640 --> 04:48.320]  stay no to tyranny is banned in China like saying their dictator president is
[04:48.320 --> 04:54.120]  winning the poo that's banned or emojis of the Taiwanese flag are banned flags of
[04:54.120 --> 05:01.280]  Tibet are banned and why not ban NPCs in America. Whether you're looking to boost

[06:42.960 --> 06:48.120]  is the most banned most demonized most line about broadcast in the world because
[06:48.120 --> 06:51.920]  we've got our finger on the pulse and we have successfully that means all of you
[06:51.920 --> 06:56.400]  listeners and viewers have helped relaunch Americana and you built I
[06:56.400 --> 07:02.000]  built we built this crew built our sponsors our affiliates all of you
[07:02.000 --> 07:08.080]  across the world built the launch gantry for the modern Saturn rocket that
[07:08.080 --> 07:14.200]  put Trump and our beachhead in the swamp into orbit and from orbit Trump can
[07:14.200 --> 07:19.360]  blast the enemy from the high ground and is having stunning incredible
[07:19.360 --> 07:25.960]  victories there is so much to cover today it is just unbelievable we have
[07:25.960 --> 07:33.360]  Honduras and Guatemala after being funded by the UN openly launching massive
[07:33.360 --> 07:38.240]  invasion forces and opening up migration routes into the United States to
[07:38.240 --> 07:42.320]  countermand the fact that Trump last year pulled out of the UN treaty they're
[07:42.320 --> 07:50.600]  still under it places like Hungary and Romania and now Austria are pulling out
[07:50.600 --> 07:55.000]  of the compact as well so is Italy well they had been thumbing their nose at
[07:55.000 --> 07:59.600]  Trump but when he promised to cut the billions in US funding this morning
[07:59.600 --> 08:06.600]  within hours Honduras and Guatemala responded to stop migrant caravan after
[08:06.600 --> 08:10.880]  Trump threats that is the Associated Press so we're talking diplomatically
[08:10.880 --> 08:16.120]  politically instant response to Trump putting his foot down and saying I
[08:16.120 --> 08:21.160]  noticed you've got borders but you open these corridors up at these trains and
[08:21.160 --> 08:25.040]  now Soros and the UN are paying for the train rides just like they pay for the
[08:25.040 --> 08:30.120]  Zodiac boat rides over from Libya right into Europe same thing into the US this
[08:30.120 --> 08:33.840]  is political warfare simply incredible so you're seeing big results there
[08:33.840 --> 08:37.080]  Trump has come out and said fellow reserve is his biggest threat and
[08:37.080 --> 08:41.920]  America's biggest threat absolutely boy see doing what Ron Paul built the
[08:41.920 --> 08:46.440]  foundation for we built the foundation for now Trump and they're exposing it's
[08:46.440 --> 08:49.720]  a private run for private fellow reserve that is countermanding the
[08:49.720 --> 08:54.200]  executive branch to the legislative you name it and doing there they want trying
[08:54.200 --> 08:59.760]  to suppress the economy but meanwhile Mika Brzezinski the daughter of the man
[08:59.760 --> 09:06.000]  that bragged that he helped put pull pot in power just an absolute monster is a
[09:06.000 --> 09:09.680]  big number since his daughter calls for Trump to be overthrown by his own
[09:09.680 --> 09:13.240]  cabinet 25th Amendment we told you that was coming over a year and a half ago
[09:13.240 --> 09:17.960]  next year's news today but she says because he's mentally ill and sick in
[09:17.960 --> 09:22.720]  the head and doing a horrible job yeah reversing everything you parasite
[09:22.720 --> 09:28.080]  scumbags did oh my gosh he's such an idiot he's such a moron and he can
[09:28.080 --> 09:31.680]  barely even get control of the traitorous federal government but has still
[09:31.680 --> 09:37.800]  righted the ship and now this country's respected again all over the world you
[09:37.800 --> 09:43.880]  are a little daddy's girl nobody given your job you have no ratings you and
[09:43.880 --> 09:48.280]  Scarborough are a joke your compromised dirtbags you and your boyfriend
[09:48.280 --> 09:53.080]  meanwhile more numbers out once Kings of TV US broadcast networks facial
[09:53.080 --> 09:57.600]  reckoning they have about 10% of the viewers they had just a decade ago and
[09:57.600 --> 10:01.800]  they're losing about 25% of those viewers every year meaning they'll basically
[10:01.800 --> 10:07.800]  have no viewers in four years same thing for CNN MSNBC you know they're very
[10:07.800 --> 10:12.000]  deceptive though they go oh my gosh Rachel Maddow was topping the ratings this
[10:12.000 --> 10:19.640]  week or oh CNN's ratings doubled this week if there's a big event there's a
[10:19.640 --> 10:24.800]  big debate or Trump's involved yes they have little spikes but there's no
[10:24.800 --> 10:29.320]  listeners or viewers on a daily basis it's just background noise it's just
[10:29.320 --> 10:32.960]  it's just chatter they're falling apart and that's why they want to censor
[10:32.960 --> 10:37.600]  everybody else that's coming up as well as we said last Friday and Sunday
[10:37.600 --> 10:42.080]  evidence because of there being no motive and because the media the
[10:42.080 --> 10:45.800]  corporate media jumped on it I and others were saying looks like it could be a
[10:45.800 --> 10:50.720]  rogue group false flag to derail the peace plans that Trump has and as he
[10:50.720 --> 10:55.480]  prepares to put the clamps on Iran that this is deep state operatives like John
[10:55.480 --> 10:59.800]  Kerry and Obama who are running their own rogue shadow State Department
[10:59.800 --> 11:04.440]  admittedly to try to derail what's happening using networks under the
[11:04.440 --> 11:08.800]  Crown Prince but not under his control just like Trump isn't in control of
[11:08.800 --> 11:13.760]  most the FBI or most of the Justice Department or most the CIA there are
[11:13.760 --> 11:17.280]  loyal people there but there are large swaths that do whatever they want or
[11:17.280 --> 11:23.680]  under the command of Hillary Obama and other slime bags they brag about this in
[11:23.680 --> 11:28.200]  the news so I'm not defending Saudi Arabia I think it's disgusting regime
[11:28.200 --> 11:33.600]  overall but if they shut down Al Qaeda and ISIS and stop supporting it and if
[11:33.600 --> 11:37.720]  they start you know cutting oil prices which they've done to help lower oil
[11:37.720 --> 11:42.960]  prices and if they come in out of the dark I was all for Muammar Gaddafi doing
[11:42.960 --> 11:46.600]  that he started investing all his money in the West for eight years did
[11:46.600 --> 11:50.400]  whatever you know it was needed to reverse some of his terrorist activities
[11:50.400 --> 11:55.240]  in the past he was helping all of Africa he was industrializing it so Hillary
[11:55.240 --> 12:00.320]  Obama set him up and killed him and then bragged about it and Gaddafi way
[12:00.320 --> 12:05.520]  better history than the Saudis all I'm saying is that we're about to have
[12:05.520 --> 12:11.880]  regime change in Iran it's super unpopular it's very authoritative and
[12:11.880 --> 12:16.880]  authoritarian and people don't like it half the population is 28 or younger and
[12:16.880 --> 12:20.920]  it would be a really good thing to have peaceful regime change over there and
[12:20.920 --> 12:25.720]  these sanctions these real sanctions are getting ready to do it and so you better
[12:25.720 --> 12:30.120]  believe one guy dies they're acting like 10 million died and I'm not saying it's
[12:30.120 --> 12:33.160]  a good thing whatever really happened to him but the fact that it's all recorded
[12:33.160 --> 12:39.960]  it's all surveilled looks like a setup on both ends but yeah we're the first to
[12:39.960 --> 12:43.880]  say it now you're from the president and the Saudi government I'm just going off
[12:43.880 --> 12:48.840]  when I see CNN MSNBC day one saying Saudi Arabia did it and this ends our
[12:48.840 --> 12:52.400]  peace deal with them and everything's over and from synidiot it's his fault
[12:52.400 --> 12:56.800]  I'm like these are known lying scumbags that I don't believe a damn word they
[12:56.800 --> 13:00.760]  say Saudi Arabia doesn't have the motive in this show what's really going on
[13:00.760 --> 13:05.400]  that's called deduction my dear Watson we're gonna be breaking all that down
[13:05.400 --> 13:10.520]  coming up but the first thing I want to hit at the bottom of the hour is the
[13:10.520 --> 13:16.400]  NPC memes it's bigger than the MPC memes you don't know what they are it's the
[13:16.400 --> 13:20.880]  idea of communication and humor and people acting in concert but
[13:20.880 --> 13:27.120]  independently creating a wave of information warfare that is unstoppable
[13:27.120 --> 13:32.160]  and a little message sent to YouTube last night by insiders that they at Big
[13:32.160 --> 13:36.880]  Tech are not all powerful like they think and that Trump holds the keys to the
[13:36.880 --> 13:41.240]  internet now he's taken them away from Obama and his stay behind network so
[13:41.240 --> 13:45.480]  we're gonna be breaking down next year's news today when we come back but
[13:45.480 --> 13:49.960]  I'm first gonna air Paul Joseph Watson's incredible report on MPC memes and why
[13:49.960 --> 13:55.080]  this is so critical and then I'm gonna lay out how this is a window into victory
[13:55.080 --> 14:00.120]  and why the enemy fears it so much from the psychological warfare positions so
[14:00.120 --> 14:05.760]  that's coming up but first ladies and gentlemen if you support us we will
[14:05.760 --> 14:09.240]  survive and thrive if you do not support us at this critical juncture we will be
[14:09.240 --> 14:13.560]  destroyed and I'm in a war with the globalist I expect I'm a big boy but I
[14:13.560 --> 14:17.400]  think you want to keep one of the main attack ships one of the main flag ships
[14:17.400 --> 14:23.280]  in the fight against globalists in the ocean in the air on the ground fighting
[14:23.280 --> 14:27.320]  and so you know they've taken our paypal they've taken a bunch of other
[14:27.320 --> 14:31.040]  payment processors we're working on some deals with payment processors that are
[14:31.040 --> 14:36.760]  more thick-skinned but you've been able to order it in four store dot com is
[14:36.760 --> 14:42.480]  is is hanging by a threat your order comes through you get it but if they
[14:42.480 --> 14:48.600]  have their victory it'll take us a few days hopefully a few weeks maximum to be
[14:48.600 --> 14:52.280]  able to get all that back up and going during this critical time so I've just
[14:52.280 --> 14:55.680]  launched our Christmas specials we had planned and we had inventory coming in

[20:29.840 --> 20:32.400]  head of google came out and admitted they're building a censorship search
[20:32.400 --> 20:35.800]  engine after the head of their operations lied to congress a few weeks ago
[20:35.800 --> 20:40.920]  and all over the news they're bragging yes anyone putting up mpc memes are
[20:40.920 --> 20:45.560]  being banned so censorship is here anything successful anything truthful
[20:45.560 --> 20:49.040]  banned here's paul joseph watson's report please spread the report it's
[20:49.040 --> 20:56.200]  posted on info wars dot com so what's this all about learning NPC meme NPCs and
[20:56.200 --> 21:00.120]  non-player characters in video games instead of being controlled by humans
[21:00.120 --> 21:03.040]  they're controlled by artificial intelligence their actions are all
[21:03.040 --> 21:08.240]  predetermined by their coding making them appear robot like formulaic
[21:08.240 --> 21:12.560]  repeating the same movements and saying the same things over and over again
[21:12.560 --> 21:17.280]  walking cliches just unconsciously repeating the same glib mantras now who
[21:17.280 --> 21:43.000]  could that possibly remind you of
[21:43.000 --> 21:58.160]  the left has struck back they say the NPC meme is dehumanizing oh my god so
[21:58.160 --> 22:05.960]  dehumanizing remember these are some of the same people who call anyone to the
[22:05.960 --> 22:10.720]  right of joseph starlin and not see oh but now you care about people being
[22:10.720 --> 22:16.080]  dehumanized cry me a river anyone unironically using the term NPC reference
[22:16.080 --> 22:19.800]  to anything other than video games is automatically a Nazi in my back when
[22:19.800 --> 22:24.320]  we're not being demonized as the new fourth Reich we're being belittled and
[22:24.320 --> 22:34.520]  dismissed as Russian box I assume whoever began pushing that mean was
[22:34.520 --> 22:37.640]  looking to further dehumanize their opposition by linking it to the in-game
[22:37.640 --> 22:42.160]  NPC players that are easily killed someone is pushing for a civil war Russia I
[22:42.160 --> 22:48.240]  assume civil war talking about it's a meme it's not the Battle of Fort Sumter
[22:48.240 --> 22:53.240]  stop it get some help they also slapped it with the dehumanizing label to try
[22:53.240 --> 22:56.240]  and get it banned because Twitter recently said it would ban people for
[22:56.240 --> 23:01.440]  using quote dehumanizing language so again even in the process of denying
[23:01.440 --> 23:07.440]  that their NPCs they act like NPCs in advocating for a sterilized internet
[23:07.440 --> 23:13.360]  where edgy banter is verboten but maybe these NPCs really aren't human maybe
[23:13.360 --> 23:18.160]  they're just like basic bitch social trends and banal popular culture as a
[23:18.160 --> 23:23.040]  default effort as a way of just trying to blend in after all what else could
[23:23.040 --> 23:26.400]  explain the success of the big bang theory and how I met your mother there's
[23:26.400 --> 23:31.400]  also this weird disconnect where they dismiss NPC as a pathetic playground
[23:31.400 --> 23:36.400]  insult not worthy of attention yet then write laborious article after article
[23:36.400 --> 23:41.400]  being triggered by it the same thing they did with soy boys what happens to kids
[23:41.400 --> 23:46.400]  who react to playground insults they get the same insult thrown at them again
[23:46.400 --> 23:49.400]  and again because it obviously gets under their skin immediately stop
[23:49.400 --> 23:53.400]  following and retweeting anyone using an avatar like the one picture below these
[23:53.400 --> 23:57.400]  are fortune trolls impersonating me this is I keep seeing this garbage all over
[23:57.400 --> 24:02.400]  my feet tonight the NPC meme gets under the left skin because it's mostly true
[24:02.400 --> 24:07.400]  the left has mainstreamed a culture of ruthless ideological intolerance the
[24:07.400 --> 24:11.400]  left has completely rejected diversity of thought when Taylor Swift tells
[24:11.400 --> 24:16.400]  everyone to vote Democrat it's an admirable call to action but when Kanye
[24:16.400 --> 24:21.400]  merely suggests that black people think about not voting Democrat he's ridiculed
[24:21.400 --> 24:27.400]  and called insane hello I am a comedian on the television if you disagree with my politics you
[24:27.400 --> 24:32.400]  literally tell husbands and wives to divorce each other if their partner
[24:32.400 --> 24:38.400]  isn't a Democrat you openly advocate the breakup of families for God forbid
[24:38.400 --> 24:42.400]  having different opinions to each other you lot reduce anyone of a certain
[24:42.400 --> 24:47.400]  skin color to be mandated to hold certain political opinions and then if they don't
[24:47.400 --> 24:52.400]  their very existence is deemed hateful how is that not dehumanizing if that's
[24:52.400 --> 24:57.400]  not the very essence of being an NPC then what is is their favorite news
[24:57.400 --> 25:02.400]  network MSNPC or is it this one is their favorite TV show is their favorite
[25:02.400 --> 25:06.400]  comedian is their favorite politician is their favorite political commentator is
[25:06.400 --> 25:11.400]  their favorite celebrity hello fellow humans I am celebrity number 2932 I
[25:11.400 --> 25:15.400]  believe in everything that is safe and popular with people aged 18 to 35 you
[25:15.400 --> 25:19.400]  may now praise me on the social media platform of your choice remember to
[25:19.400 --> 25:23.400]  purchase my nearly manufactured album here's a visual representation of how
[25:23.400 --> 25:27.400]  Twitter works I agree our agreement with each other's views means we are right
[25:27.400 --> 25:31.400]  and the other side's evil hatred must be stopped well I got all of these accounts
[25:31.400 --> 25:35.400]  suspended but why do I still feel so empty and pathetic is the Krasenstein
[25:35.400 --> 25:42.400]  twins is their arch enemy black not equal Democrat system error here's God only
[25:42.400 --> 25:46.400]  knows what this is here's what happens to anyone who suggests that maybe Trump
[25:46.400 --> 25:52.400]  isn't the new hitler rate is bad orange man is bad I'm still waiting for someone
[25:52.400 --> 25:57.400]  to tell me what I'm a race over today I follow such a diverse range of people
[25:57.400 --> 26:00.400]  and for me this is what Twitter is all about get out of your echo chambers and
[26:00.400 --> 26:05.400]  start listening to unique and individual voices I agree with whatever Twitter
[26:05.400 --> 26:10.400]  terms of use says I should agree with as Evan James writes the NPC meme is a
[26:10.400 --> 26:14.400]  response to something real something that snarky liberals and even leftists
[26:14.400 --> 26:19.400]  increasingly fail to notice in short it is a tragic comic acknowledgement that
[26:19.400 --> 26:24.400]  things are not okay that we are all NPCs to one degree or another because we're
[26:24.400 --> 26:29.400]  all in bondage the NPC meme lampoons our tendency to consume the products of
[26:29.400 --> 26:34.400]  mass culture precisely because they are easy to process requiring neither
[26:34.400 --> 26:39.400]  personal effort nor prior learning serious cultural engagement requires
[26:39.400 --> 26:44.400]  focus it nevertheless has a rejuvenating effect whereas the passive consumption
[26:44.400 --> 26:48.400]  of mass culture leaves us more innovated than before and the same goes for
[26:48.400 --> 26:53.400]  political opinions it takes a modicum of research in a small step beyond
[26:53.400 --> 26:57.400]  superficial thinking to understand that no not everyone who doesn't have
[26:57.400 --> 27:03.400]  hashtag FBPE or a blue wave in their profile is an alt-right neo-nazi and
[27:03.400 --> 27:08.400]  no Donald Trump isn't leading America into a dystopian nightmare where the
[27:08.400 --> 27:12.400]  planets oceans boil over and women who have abortions are sent to
[27:12.400 --> 27:16.400]  concentration camp you are fake news everyone freaked out over the EU
[27:16.400 --> 27:21.400]  planning to ban me Twitter is already banning NPC memes and the accounts of
[27:21.400 --> 27:26.400]  people who post them or you can make your avatar a Trump orange or a Cheeto all
[27:26.400 --> 27:30.400]  day long you're not gonna get banned of course we all know why the left wants to
[27:30.400 --> 27:34.400]  ban memes because the left can't mean that's not just a cliche they admit to
[27:34.400 --> 27:38.400]  it a study undertaken by researchers at University College London found that the
[27:38.400 --> 27:42.400]  most effective memes largely originated in two places the Donald
[27:42.400 --> 27:46.400]  subreddit and fortune a vice-writer for the study acknowledges that the mouse
[27:46.400 --> 27:51.400]  quote effectively spread memes originated on the Donald and Paul that's why they
[27:51.400 --> 27:56.400]  want to ban the NPC meme not because it's dehumanizing they dehumanize us
[27:56.400 --> 28:00.400]  every available opportunity they want to ban it because it's effective and
[28:00.400 --> 28:04.400]  they have no adequate way of responding because they can't mean they can't
[28:04.400 --> 28:09.400]  mean because memes incorporate edgy humor oh my god so edgy left is incapable
[28:09.400 --> 28:13.400]  of edgy humor because they're always walking on eggshells they're always
[28:13.400 --> 28:18.400]  terrified of offending someone that's how they ruined comedy this means dead
[28:18.400 --> 28:22.400]  now you talked about it you kill more memes than PewDiePie shut up as I've
[28:22.400 --> 28:27.400]  explained before with facts and evidence I don't kill memes I send them into
[28:27.400 --> 28:32.400]  space I'm the space X of memes give people more credit I've killed fewer memes
[28:32.400 --> 28:37.400]  than the amount of Native American DNA in Elizabeth Warren's blood so yes the
[28:37.400 --> 28:43.400]  NPC meme is funny and effective because it's mostly true that's why they hate
[28:43.400 --> 28:47.400]  it that's why with the midterms just a few weeks away and with the walk away
[28:47.400 --> 28:52.400]  movement growing the NPC meme freaks them out

[33:26.400 --> 33:31.400]  it is only fitting that a free screen should sound the alarm against those

[33:33.400 --> 33:38.400]  or in its heart to deceive and inflame or enlighten and inspire
[33:38.400 --> 33:56.400]  the motion picture has no equal
[33:56.400 --> 34:00.400]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen we're in the middle of the meme revolution
[34:00.400 --> 34:04.400]  the European Union's passed a law to make everyone pre-approved memes
[34:04.400 --> 34:09.400]  or you can be sent to president or find Mexico has a law going through their
[34:09.400 --> 34:12.400]  Congress to ban memes
[34:12.400 --> 34:15.400]  that's right because it's a new form of communication
[34:15.400 --> 34:20.400]  the globalists want us to use emojis and things that restrict and reduce language
[34:20.400 --> 34:24.400]  that's what the Socialist Party, Fabian Socialists in England always called for
[34:24.400 --> 34:26.400]  and they're kind of the managing system in the world
[34:26.400 --> 34:29.400]  it got adopted by the globalists
[34:29.400 --> 34:34.400]  but they don't like memes because computer AI can't tell what's funny and what's not
[34:34.400 --> 34:38.400]  they're very hard to pre-censor with algorithms
[34:38.400 --> 34:43.400]  and someone makes a funny joke and then people vote basically by sharing it
[34:43.400 --> 34:45.400]  and promoting it on the internet
[34:45.400 --> 34:48.400]  and they text it to their friends they email it to their family
[34:48.400 --> 34:52.400]  they get around the sensors and then other people
[34:52.400 --> 34:55.400]  get involved in the creative process
[34:55.400 --> 34:58.400]  and they make it funnier or they make it sillier
[34:58.400 --> 35:01.400]  and then they promote that
[35:01.400 --> 35:05.400]  and then it creates a synthesis of getting people involved
[35:05.400 --> 35:09.400]  and of creating a survival of the fittest meme
[35:09.400 --> 35:12.400]  and it devastates the globalist
[35:12.400 --> 35:16.400]  who are classic conformists
[35:16.400 --> 35:21.400]  and who whether it be a fascist regime or a communist regime
[35:21.400 --> 35:23.400]  or a cult run regime
[35:23.400 --> 35:28.400]  want everyone to dress the same, to look the same, to talk the same
[35:28.400 --> 35:31.400]  and in the 20th century and 21st century
[35:31.400 --> 35:35.400]  whether it's 1984 or Brave New World or THX1138
[35:35.400 --> 35:38.400]  or Pink Floyd, The Wall
[35:38.400 --> 35:42.400]  or Apple commercials in the 80s
[35:42.400 --> 35:45.400]  people in gray with gray faces
[35:45.400 --> 35:48.400]  whose faces all look the same
[35:48.400 --> 35:52.400]  who are basically featureless
[35:52.400 --> 35:55.400]  they are the symbol
[35:55.400 --> 35:58.400]  of mass produced thought
[35:58.400 --> 36:02.400]  they are the symbol of authoritarianism
[36:02.400 --> 36:04.400]  that everyone recognizes
[36:04.400 --> 36:07.400]  you come in diverse to the university
[36:07.400 --> 36:10.400]  you come out nameless, faceless
[36:10.400 --> 36:12.400]  in a group with a group leader
[36:12.400 --> 36:16.400]  you're fed in to the meat grinder
[36:16.400 --> 36:19.400]  you are rendered down
[36:19.400 --> 36:24.400]  and you're put into these maze-like systems of conformity
[36:27.400 --> 36:30.400]  and so
[36:30.400 --> 36:33.400]  the great geniuses over at 4chan and 8chan
[36:33.400 --> 36:36.400]  and all the great folks out there go wait a minute
[36:36.400 --> 36:39.400]  the MPC, I'm not a big video game player
[36:39.400 --> 36:41.400]  but I know enough about it to know
[36:41.400 --> 36:44.400]  the MPC characters just aren't operating on their own
[36:44.400 --> 36:46.400]  they're pre-programmed, they're stupid
[36:46.400 --> 36:49.400]  and the symbol of the MPC, we'll put it on screen for TV viewers
[36:49.400 --> 36:52.400]  is a gray face
[36:52.400 --> 36:55.400]  with a
[36:55.400 --> 36:57.400]  triangle nose
[36:57.400 --> 37:00.400]  and a slit for a mouth
[37:00.400 --> 37:02.400]  well where else have we seen that?
[37:02.400 --> 37:05.400]  we've seen that
[37:05.400 --> 37:10.400]  in THX1138
[37:10.400 --> 37:12.400]  which again is
[37:12.400 --> 37:14.400]  a remake of another name
[37:14.400 --> 37:16.400]  of Brave New World
[37:16.400 --> 37:18.400]  as his college film
[37:18.400 --> 37:21.400]  and then he went on to make it as his first feature film
[37:21.400 --> 37:23.400]  his name is George Lucas
[37:23.400 --> 37:25.400]  of Star Wars, of Indiana Jones
[37:25.400 --> 37:28.400]  and the rest of it
[37:28.400 --> 37:30.400]  and so he's pointing out the conformity
[37:30.400 --> 37:33.400]  and this is directly from THX1138
[37:33.400 --> 37:36.400]  of a automaton
[37:36.400 --> 37:39.400]  a individual that's had their individualism
[37:39.400 --> 37:42.400]  stripped from them
[37:42.400 --> 37:44.400]  and now they're a clean slate
[37:44.400 --> 37:46.400]  to which
[37:46.400 --> 37:48.400]  the new program can be loaded onto
[37:48.400 --> 37:50.400]  or erased
[37:50.400 --> 37:52.400]  and then a new program put back on
[37:52.400 --> 37:54.400]  and in the Brave New World
[37:54.400 --> 37:56.400]  in the THX1138 system
[37:56.400 --> 37:58.400]  that was based on real eugenics ideas
[37:58.400 --> 38:00.400]  in the 1920s in England
[38:00.400 --> 38:02.400]  published in 1932 as fiction
[38:02.400 --> 38:04.400]  later published as non-fiction in 61
[38:04.400 --> 38:06.400]  Brave New World revisited
[38:06.400 --> 38:08.400]  they told you this is the real plan
[38:08.400 --> 38:10.400]  shaved heads, gray uniforms
[38:10.400 --> 38:12.400]  men and women not having sex
[38:12.400 --> 38:14.400]  sexless lives
[38:14.400 --> 38:16.400]  humans created in petri dishes
[38:16.400 --> 38:18.400]  in test tubes
[38:20.400 --> 38:22.400]  and that's now where we are
[38:22.400 --> 38:24.400]  and that's now what's been done
[38:24.400 --> 38:26.400]  and forced drugging
[38:28.400 --> 38:30.400]  with serotonin reuptake inhibitors
[38:30.400 --> 38:32.400]  and other mind control drugs
[38:32.400 --> 38:34.400]  right out of the CIA, right out of MKUltra
[38:34.400 --> 38:36.400]  now what are the public schools, what are the colleges
[38:36.400 --> 38:38.400]  forcing these things on you
[38:38.400 --> 38:40.400]  half the population on some type
[38:40.400 --> 38:42.400]  of psychotropic or opiate
[38:42.400 --> 38:44.400]  type drug of those two classes
[38:44.400 --> 38:46.400]  federal government says
[38:46.400 --> 38:48.400]  they have a target now of 80% of children
[38:48.400 --> 38:50.400]  to be on these drugs by 2030
[38:52.400 --> 38:54.400]  roughly 30% are on psychotropics now
[38:54.400 --> 38:56.400]  children well the age of 18
[38:56.400 --> 38:58.400]  so you keep wondering
[38:58.400 --> 39:00.400]  why is this really happening
[39:00.400 --> 39:02.400]  oh and what else is in THX1138
[39:02.400 --> 39:04.400]  robot enforcers
[39:04.400 --> 39:06.400]  drones
[39:06.400 --> 39:08.400]  motorcycle cops
[39:08.400 --> 39:10.400]  and what have they announced
[39:10.400 --> 39:12.400]  motorcycle, autonomous
[39:12.400 --> 39:14.400]  motorcycles
[39:14.400 --> 39:16.400]  in Europe that are robots
[39:16.400 --> 39:18.400]  driving around surveilling you
[39:18.400 --> 39:20.400]  and in New York City
[39:20.400 --> 39:22.400]  autonomous
[39:22.400 --> 39:24.400]  robots spying on you
[39:24.400 --> 39:26.400]  and now they're moving to arm them
[39:26.400 --> 39:28.400]  including drones
[39:28.400 --> 39:30.400]  with hand grenade launchers
[39:32.400 --> 39:34.400]  and THX1138
[39:34.400 --> 39:36.400]  THX1138 is one big giant
[39:36.400 --> 39:38.400]  hive bubble city
[39:38.400 --> 39:40.400]  like Google is actually building these bubble cities
[39:40.400 --> 39:42.400]  inside cities that you opt to go into
[39:42.400 --> 39:44.400]  you think you're part of the elite
[39:44.400 --> 39:46.400]  and then it's one big
[39:46.400 --> 39:48.400]  giant social conditioning center
[39:48.400 --> 39:50.400]  one giant reeducation camp
[39:50.400 --> 39:52.400]  Hillary Clinton's
[39:52.400 --> 39:54.400]  fun camps
[39:54.400 --> 39:56.400]  but where else have we seen the banned MPC
[39:56.400 --> 39:58.400]  mean because the New York Times
[39:58.400 --> 40:00.400]  relishes today
[40:00.400 --> 40:02.400]  that thank God Twitter and Facebook
[40:02.400 --> 40:04.400]  have banned hundreds of accounts
[40:04.400 --> 40:06.400]  it's now thousands
[40:06.400 --> 40:08.400]  if you show the MPC
[40:08.400 --> 40:10.400]  conformity
[40:10.400 --> 40:12.400]  if you project it
[40:12.400 --> 40:14.400]  onto Silicon Valley all meeting around a round table
[40:14.400 --> 40:16.400]  and agreeing to censor conservatives
[40:16.400 --> 40:18.400]  and you say that's authoritarianism
[40:18.400 --> 40:20.400]  you're banned and the New York Times
[40:20.400 --> 40:22.400]  sees no irony in it saying
[40:22.400 --> 40:24.400]  the MPC meme is dehumanizing
[40:24.400 --> 40:26.400]  no it's reminding you to have your humanity
[40:26.400 --> 40:28.400]  it's reminding you to not go with conformity
[40:28.400 --> 40:30.400]  they'd already met with
[40:30.400 --> 40:32.400]  Twitter months before
[40:32.400 --> 40:34.400]  they'd already planned to ban me we had intel on that
[40:34.400 --> 40:36.400]  I told you it was coming then I said he'll ban me later
[40:36.400 --> 40:38.400]  they just want to act like they're not a uniform cult
[40:38.400 --> 40:40.400]  and then Jack
[40:40.400 --> 40:42.400]  Dorsey one of the biggest proponents
[40:42.400 --> 40:44.400]  of censorship
[40:44.400 --> 40:46.400]  to then have his cake and eat it too and then ban me later
[40:46.400 --> 40:48.400]  with cause of course
[40:48.400 --> 40:50.400]  I was rude to a reporter
[40:50.400 --> 40:52.400]  they just say
[40:52.400 --> 40:54.400]  on Twitter go kill members of the cabinet
[40:54.400 --> 40:56.400]  that's okay they just say overthrow the president
[40:56.400 --> 40:58.400]  that's okay they just say
[40:58.400 --> 41:00.400]  go out and harass people at restaurants that's okay
[41:00.400 --> 41:02.400]  they just doctor people live and say come kill them
[41:02.400 --> 41:04.400]  that's okay
[41:04.400 --> 41:06.400]  so here it is what is the MPC
[41:06.400 --> 41:08.400]  the pro-trump internet's new favorite
[41:08.400 --> 41:10.400]  insult
[41:10.400 --> 41:12.400]  Twitter has
[41:12.400 --> 41:14.400]  barred hundreds of right-wing accounts
[41:14.400 --> 41:16.400]  for posting
[41:16.400 --> 41:18.400]  the soulless non-playable
[41:18.400 --> 41:20.400]  liberal activist
[41:20.400 --> 41:22.400]  there you go
[41:22.400 --> 41:24.400]  so see
[41:24.400 --> 41:26.400]  they're telling you
[41:26.400 --> 41:28.400]  now
[41:28.400 --> 41:30.400]  like the thousands of sites banned off Twitter and Facebook
[41:30.400 --> 41:32.400]  in a week they just said we consider conservative
[41:32.400 --> 41:34.400]  thought spam now
[41:34.400 --> 41:36.400]  you're all banned many accounts with millions of followers
[41:36.400 --> 41:38.400]  veterans groups are being banned
[41:38.400 --> 41:40.400]  Christian groups are being banned
[41:40.400 --> 41:42.400]  it's all being banned
[41:42.400 --> 41:44.400]  it's a takeover and then they don't want you pointing it out
[41:44.400 --> 41:46.400]  that it's the archetype of TH6-1138
[41:46.400 --> 41:48.400]  or 1984
[41:48.400 --> 41:50.400]  you know this commercial would be banned today
[41:50.400 --> 41:52.400]  this 1984
[41:52.400 --> 41:54.400]  Super Bowl commercial you're about to see
[41:54.400 --> 41:56.400]  would be banned today
[41:56.400 --> 41:58.400]  because it features the MPC
[41:58.400 --> 42:26.400]  back from the future here it is
[42:26.400 --> 42:28.400]  look at the MPCs
[42:28.400 --> 42:30.400]  our system's all powerful nothing can crack it
[42:30.400 --> 42:32.400]  you all have grey MPC faces
[42:32.400 --> 42:34.400]  you are MPC
[42:34.400 --> 42:36.400]  you are MPC
[42:36.400 --> 42:38.400]  and we say no
[42:38.400 --> 42:40.400]  so now they even ban us from showing the archetypal image
[42:40.400 --> 42:42.400]  of what they are
[42:42.400 --> 42:44.400]  but info wars
[42:44.400 --> 42:46.400]  will shatter them
[42:46.400 --> 42:48.400]  yes

[47:04.400 --> 47:08.400]  show
[47:08.400 --> 47:10.400]  the president of the united states
[47:10.400 --> 47:12.400]  is racist
[47:12.400 --> 47:14.400]  he's a punk
[47:14.400 --> 47:16.400]  he's a dog
[47:16.400 --> 47:18.400]  he's a pig
[47:18.400 --> 47:20.400]  and he can suck my f***
[47:20.400 --> 47:22.400]  he's a con, a bullshit artist, a mutt
[47:22.400 --> 47:24.400]  he's my mother f*** as you
[47:24.400 --> 47:26.400]  b***h punk f***er
[47:26.400 --> 47:28.400]  the president of the united states
[47:28.400 --> 47:30.400]  is a weak man
[47:30.400 --> 47:32.400]  he's not only umptick to be president
[47:32.400 --> 47:34.400]  in my book
[47:34.400 --> 47:36.400]  he's lack of entity, he's lack of leadership
[47:36.400 --> 47:38.400]  he's lack of courage
[47:38.400 --> 47:40.400]  he is clearly trying to ignite
[47:40.400 --> 47:42.400]  a civil war in this country
[47:42.400 --> 48:08.400]  this is CNN
[48:12.400 --> 48:14.400]  and it's time for humanity to stand up
[48:14.400 --> 48:16.400]  in the info war
[48:16.400 --> 48:18.400]  and say I don't know what's going to happen
[48:18.400 --> 48:20.400]  at the end of this
[48:20.400 --> 48:22.400]  but you want to fight
[48:22.400 --> 48:24.400]  you better believe you got one
[48:26.400 --> 48:28.400]  from the front lines of the
[48:28.400 --> 48:30.400]  information war
[48:30.400 --> 48:32.400]  it's Alex Jones
[48:34.400 --> 48:36.400]  I came to destroy the globus
[48:36.400 --> 48:38.400]  the globus
[48:40.400 --> 48:42.400]  escape is not my plan
[48:42.400 --> 48:44.400]  but I do not face the globus alone
[48:44.400 --> 48:46.400]  my friends
[48:46.400 --> 48:48.400]  we have got on our side and you are standing
[48:48.400 --> 48:50.400]  right beside me
[48:50.400 --> 48:52.400]  we are doing it
[48:52.400 --> 48:54.400]  prosperity is pouring back in
[48:54.400 --> 48:56.400]  because the president has gotten
[48:56.400 --> 48:58.400]  20% control of the federal government
[48:58.400 --> 49:00.400]  his real
[49:00.400 --> 49:02.400]  sterling achievement is that
[49:02.400 --> 49:04.400]  he can take the attacks
[49:04.400 --> 49:06.400]  and attack on the enemy
[49:06.400 --> 49:08.400]  withstand all the peer pressure
[49:08.400 --> 49:10.400]  the $2 billion he's lost of his fortune
[49:10.400 --> 49:12.400]  from all the lawsuits and attacks
[49:12.400 --> 49:14.400]  and golf course deals he lost
[49:14.400 --> 49:16.400]  and tournaments he lost
[49:16.400 --> 49:18.400]  and everything else
[49:18.400 --> 49:20.400]  and his family has gone through the fire for us
[49:20.400 --> 49:22.400]  he said I love this country
[49:22.400 --> 49:24.400]  I don't need to be president
[49:24.400 --> 49:26.400]  I don't want to be president but I got to do it
[49:26.400 --> 49:28.400]  I just can't watch them
[49:28.400 --> 49:30.400]  flush the country
[49:30.400 --> 49:32.400]  and everybody screw us over
[49:32.400 --> 49:34.400]  I am not only true about Scott from Scotland
[49:34.400 --> 49:36.400]  they are the tightest bunch he will ever run into
[49:36.400 --> 49:38.400]  but they are also good people and have a lot of courage
[49:38.400 --> 49:40.400]  and I have got some Scott in my background
[49:40.400 --> 49:42.400]  on my dad's mother's side
[49:42.400 --> 49:44.400]  but the point is
[49:44.400 --> 49:46.400]  that Trump is the type of guy
[49:46.400 --> 49:48.400]  that constantly gives the charity
[49:48.400 --> 49:50.400]  never tells anybody
[49:50.400 --> 49:52.400]  he helps kids get livers, kidneys
[49:52.400 --> 49:54.400]  sometimes he will just like somebody that works for him
[49:54.400 --> 49:56.400]  and learn they have a problem and buy him a house
[49:56.400 --> 49:58.400]  and this is real stuff Trump does
[49:58.400 --> 50:00.400]  but
[50:00.400 --> 50:02.400]  he has a lot of companies and other hard nosers
[50:02.400 --> 50:04.400]  he loves to run over them
[50:04.400 --> 50:06.400]  he loves to beat them
[50:06.400 --> 50:08.400]  he loves to dominate powerful people that are bad
[50:08.400 --> 50:10.400]  and watching China
[50:10.400 --> 50:12.400]  and watching the EU
[50:12.400 --> 50:14.400]  and watching all these people
[50:14.400 --> 50:16.400]  and the globalists sell out the country
[50:16.400 --> 50:18.400]  making him sick
[50:18.400 --> 50:20.400]  there is interviews with him 40 years ago
[50:20.400 --> 50:22.400]  hard to believe she is on the air that long
[50:22.400 --> 50:24.400]  40 years ago
[50:24.400 --> 50:26.400]  with Oprah Winfrey saying all the same stuff
[50:26.400 --> 50:28.400]  that's who he is
[50:28.400 --> 50:30.400]  the New York Times found stories
[50:30.400 --> 50:32.400]  and reports of his dad
[50:32.400 --> 50:34.400]  in the 30's
[50:34.400 --> 50:36.400]  when there were communist riots in New York
[50:36.400 --> 50:38.400]  and police reports about his dad beating up
[50:38.400 --> 50:40.400]  four or five of them
[50:40.400 --> 50:42.400]  that was
[50:42.400 --> 50:44.400]  that was
[50:44.400 --> 50:46.400]  his father
[50:46.400 --> 50:48.400]  and so that's where
[50:48.400 --> 50:50.400]  Trump comes from
[50:50.400 --> 50:52.400]  a bunch of commies attack him
[50:52.400 --> 50:54.400]  he beats the hell out of them
[50:54.400 --> 50:56.400]  and that's what it's all about and we are beating
[50:56.400 --> 50:58.400]  these people now
[50:58.400 --> 51:00.400]  ladies and gentlemen
[51:00.400 --> 51:02.400]  they are people that have been perched on top
[51:02.400 --> 51:04.400]  of this nation selling it out
[51:04.400 --> 51:06.400]  and then telling themselves what geniuses they are
[51:06.400 --> 51:08.400]  and now they are so desperate
[51:08.400 --> 51:10.400]  that the success continues they are done forever
[51:10.400 --> 51:12.400]  there is a major realignment against them
[51:12.400 --> 51:14.400]  so now
[51:14.400 --> 51:16.400]  we are talking about the 25th amendment and removing him
[51:16.400 --> 51:18.400]  because he is mentally gone and he is a loser
[51:18.400 --> 51:20.400]  no you are the losers
[51:20.400 --> 51:22.400]  he beat against all the odds with the American people
[51:22.400 --> 51:24.400]  at his side
[51:24.400 --> 51:26.400]  this is a historic time to be alive
[51:26.400 --> 51:28.400]  and I thank God every minute
[51:28.400 --> 51:30.400]  here is Mika Brzezinski the daughter
[51:30.400 --> 51:32.400]  of a war criminal
[51:32.400 --> 51:34.400]  shooting her filthy mouth off
[51:34.400 --> 51:36.400]  on her dying collapsed failed MSNBC
[51:36.400 --> 51:38.400]  CNBC show
[51:38.400 --> 51:40.400]  here it is
[51:40.400 --> 51:42.400]  women and men should not behave this way
[51:42.400 --> 51:44.400]  and we should call it out
[51:44.400 --> 51:46.400]  and actually
[51:46.400 --> 51:48.400]  for me
[51:48.400 --> 51:50.400]  this is one of the many
[51:50.400 --> 51:52.400]  many ways this president
[51:52.400 --> 51:54.400]  has shown us
[51:54.400 --> 51:56.400]  that he is not fit
[51:56.400 --> 51:58.400]  possibly not even well
[51:58.400 --> 52:00.400]  and I don't understand the people in this
[52:00.400 --> 52:02.400]  administration taking matters into their own
[52:02.400 --> 52:04.400]  hands and trying to sort of stick it out
[52:04.400 --> 52:06.400]  because they can keep things together
[52:06.400 --> 52:08.400]  on the foreign policy front
[52:08.400 --> 52:10.400]  he is cratering
[52:10.400 --> 52:12.400]  our reputation
[52:12.400 --> 52:14.400]  he is making us an international
[52:14.400 --> 52:16.400]  joke we are losing our influence
[52:16.400 --> 52:18.400]  because this is a type
[52:18.400 --> 52:20.400]  of man who calls a woman a horse face
[52:20.400 --> 52:22.400]  by the way a woman he chose to have sex with
[52:22.400 --> 52:24.400]  so I don't even know where that begins
[52:24.400 --> 52:26.400]  and ends and I wouldn't want to pick that apart
[52:26.400 --> 52:28.400]  but if you look at
[52:28.400 --> 52:30.400]  how he is speaking on the international
[52:30.400 --> 52:32.400]  stage about the
[52:32.400 --> 52:34.400]  murder of a Washington post
[52:34.400 --> 52:36.400]  reporter that itself
[52:36.400 --> 52:38.400]  should be deeply disturbing
[52:38.400 --> 52:40.400]  to anybody who works inside
[52:40.400 --> 52:42.400]  the White House works on the national
[52:42.400 --> 52:44.400]  security team works in
[52:44.400 --> 52:46.400]  the State Department at some point
[52:46.400 --> 52:48.400]  you are working for a president
[52:48.400 --> 52:50.400]  who is not fit to lead
[52:50.400 --> 52:52.400]  who is going to do something crazy in
[52:52.400 --> 52:54.400]  five minutes one hour tonight
[52:54.400 --> 52:56.400]  or tomorrow like what more do you need
[52:56.400 --> 52:58.400]  to hear from him to start
[52:58.400 --> 53:00.400]  thinking 25th amendment or something
[53:00.400 --> 53:02.400]  else okay this is not okay
[53:02.400 --> 53:04.400]  you are not okay
[53:04.400 --> 53:06.400]  your father
[53:06.400 --> 53:08.400]  Zbigniew Brzezinski led the collapse
[53:08.400 --> 53:10.400]  of Iran
[53:10.400 --> 53:12.400]  helped put the I.T.K.
[53:12.400 --> 53:14.400]  and then
[53:14.400 --> 53:16.400]  had the whole botched
[53:16.400 --> 53:18.400]  rescue operation
[53:18.400 --> 53:20.400]  into
[53:20.400 --> 53:22.400]  Iran
[53:22.400 --> 53:24.400]  so you are the loser
[53:24.400 --> 53:26.400]  when you talk about Iran or Saudi Arabia
[53:26.400 --> 53:28.400]  so she's talking about overthrowing
[53:28.400 --> 53:30.400]  the president via the cabinet and this is all the lie works
[53:30.400 --> 53:32.400]  they harass the families of the cabinet
[53:32.400 --> 53:34.400]  they harass them it's a lot of them are too
[53:34.400 --> 53:36.400]  faced and say oh yeah I don't like Trump either
[53:36.400 --> 53:38.400]  so they don't get attacked
[53:40.400 --> 53:42.400]  and so you got a lot of cowardice going on
[53:42.400 --> 53:44.400]  but the idea that
[53:44.400 --> 53:46.400]  oh despite Trump
[53:46.400 --> 53:48.400]  we're having some success
[53:48.400 --> 53:50.400]  that's ridiculous it's like
[53:50.400 --> 53:52.400]  Honduras and Guatemala have
[53:52.400 --> 53:54.400]  UN funding for the UN treaty
[53:54.400 --> 53:56.400]  that Trump's pulled us out of
[53:56.400 --> 53:58.400]  that now the rest of Europe's pulling out of
[53:58.400 --> 54:00.400]  globalist coalition falling apart that's leadership
[54:00.400 --> 54:02.400]  they're setting up hundreds of thousands
[54:02.400 --> 54:04.400]  of people in these caravans to open up
[54:04.400 --> 54:06.400]  these migration lanes
[54:06.400 --> 54:08.400]  and Trump said you do that I'm cutting
[54:08.400 --> 54:10.400]  your funding and within a few hours
[54:10.400 --> 54:12.400]  they said okay we're going to turn them back
[54:12.400 --> 54:14.400]  to UN money anymore because the US is giving us
[54:14.400 --> 54:16.400]  five times more
[54:16.400 --> 54:18.400]  major national security issue but right there
[54:18.400 --> 54:20.400]  that's immediate
[54:20.400 --> 54:22.400]  the economy thousands
[54:22.400 --> 54:24.400]  of new factories everything's starting
[54:24.400 --> 54:26.400]  to secure our border arrest the border up
[54:26.400 --> 54:28.400]  four times MS-13
[54:28.400 --> 54:30.400]  arrest up exponentially what 250
[54:30.400 --> 54:32.400]  something percent
[54:34.400 --> 54:36.400]  amazing stuff going on and then you sit
[54:36.400 --> 54:38.400]  there when you've done nothing in your life
[54:38.400 --> 54:40.400]  but be a little rich girl
[54:40.400 --> 54:42.400]  who her father was with the failed
[54:42.400 --> 54:44.400]  administration of Jimmy Carter for God sakes
[54:44.400 --> 54:46.400]  and we're looking probably
[54:46.400 --> 54:48.400]  the greatest president since George Washington
[54:48.400 --> 54:50.400]  and you don't know what to do so you're trying to tell us
[54:50.400 --> 54:52.400]  he's horrible he's stupid he's bad
[54:52.400 --> 54:54.400]  meanwhile he's the only one
[54:54.400 --> 54:56.400]  speaking out against the censorship by big tech
[54:56.400 --> 54:58.400]  that they now admit they're doing to conservatives
[54:58.400 --> 55:00.400]  I mean if someone puts out
[55:00.400 --> 55:02.400]  an MPC meme of a gray
[55:02.400 --> 55:04.400]  face over a group of people acting like
[55:04.400 --> 55:06.400]  sheep
[55:06.400 --> 55:08.400]  like Apple ads
[55:08.400 --> 55:10.400]  and like 1984 and like THX
[55:10.400 --> 55:12.400]  1138 and every other dystopic
[55:12.400 --> 55:14.400]  movie and book you know
[55:14.400 --> 55:16.400]  that you're in a cult and you got shaved heads
[55:16.400 --> 55:18.400]  like the hillbop cult
[55:18.400 --> 55:20.400]  and you're wearing gray uniforms
[55:22.400 --> 55:24.400]  now you want to tell our kids they can't have mommy or daddy
[55:24.400 --> 55:26.400]  or they can't say they're a boy and girl that's beyond
[55:26.400 --> 55:28.400]  1984
[55:28.400 --> 55:30.400]  they were just talking about getting rid of the family
[55:30.400 --> 55:32.400]  in 1984 you're actually trying to
[55:32.400 --> 55:34.400]  do it
[55:34.400 --> 55:36.400]  you people are monsters
[55:36.400 --> 55:38.400]  and so everyone just keep making the MPC
[55:38.400 --> 55:40.400]  memes and let them ban us
[55:40.400 --> 55:42.400]  we're going to create a whole section for memes
[55:42.400 --> 55:44.400]  the next week on info wars.com
[55:44.400 --> 55:46.400]  like a message board
[55:46.400 --> 55:48.400]  where you can just go in like reddit
[55:48.400 --> 55:50.400]  whatever and just post as long as it's legal and lawful
[55:52.400 --> 55:54.400]  you're racist you're not racist you're christian
[55:54.400 --> 55:56.400]  you're not christian whatever as long as it's not illegal
[55:56.400 --> 55:58.400]  as long as it's not threats
[55:58.400 --> 56:00.400]  we're going to bring internet freedom back ladies and gentlemen
[56:00.400 --> 56:02.400]  and we'll just have memes central
[56:02.400 --> 56:04.400]  and the best ones will be on the front page
[56:04.400 --> 56:06.400]  and we're going to have daily prizes for memes
[56:06.400 --> 56:08.400]  because it's memes that threaten them the most

[57:48.400 --> 57:50.400]  X2
[57:50.400 --> 57:52.400]  we were selling it for about 3 years
[57:52.400 --> 57:54.400]  and then they found out how big it was
[57:54.400 --> 57:56.400]  and how much we were buying
[57:56.400 --> 57:58.400]  we wanted more money more money and oh this and that
[57:58.400 --> 58:00.400]  and so I've broken my contract
[58:00.400 --> 58:02.400]  and right now we can't get more of this
[58:02.400 --> 58:04.400]  proprietary ingredient that goes
[58:04.400 --> 58:06.400]  next to it that literally is so pure
[58:06.400 --> 58:08.400]  that if you put in a picker dish on top
[58:08.400 --> 58:10.400]  of 90 degree hot plate it gasses
[58:10.400 --> 58:12.400]  like I dream of genie
[58:12.400 --> 58:14.400]  and then this purple gas I mean that is so pure
[58:14.400 --> 58:16.400]  it just goes right into your body when you take it
[58:16.400 --> 58:18.400]  we're working on trying to get other suppliers
[58:18.400 --> 58:20.400]  right now but I bought
[58:20.400 --> 58:22.400]  a huge amount of it
[58:22.400 --> 58:24.400]  ordered it six months ago
[58:24.400 --> 58:26.400]  the price down I said if you don't lower it
[58:26.400 --> 58:28.400]  I'm done I'm breaking the contract
[58:28.400 --> 58:30.400]  well I broke the contract last week
[58:30.400 --> 58:32.400]  and so this is potentially the last run

[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:19.480]  face and it just keeps happening over and over again.
[01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:21.920]  So how are they saying that to you?
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:25.320]  I mean, how are they calling you KKK and racist?
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:26.320]  Because I support Trump.
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:29.840]  They say if you support a racist, you are a racist, which, you know, he's not a racist
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:34.600]  and it's actually impossible to be a black member of the KKK, but, you know, like, meat
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:37.600]  eating vegans and Jewish Nazis just doesn't work out.
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:43.680]  Yeah, you know, I was speaking to a protestor over here and he said earlier that Kanye lost
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:45.800]  his black card because he supports Trump.
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:47.560]  Is that kind of the same reaction you're getting?
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:49.520]  Yeah, I get a lot of the same reaction.
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:55.960]  So being black is not about, you know, supporting a particular political ideology.
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:57.760]  You know, you're black, that's a skin color.
[01:02:57.760 --> 01:02:59.960]  You know, a lot of people ask me, they say, are you an African-American?
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:00.960]  No, I'm not an African-American.
[01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:01.960]  I'm just an American.
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:05.000]  I'm a black American, but I'm not an African-American.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.420]  And the thing that they want to say is, oh, you're not invited to the cookout anymore.
[01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:10.800]  You lost your black card.
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:11.860]  It's complete nonsense.
[01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:14.440]  What they mean is you've left the plantation.
[01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:17.880]  And the reason that they can't say you've left the plantation is because then they'll
[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:21.840]  be exposed for the true racists that they are, you know, the racists that brought a slavery
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:27.320]  Jim Crow and the KKK, the racists that abort 900 black babies every single day under the
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:29.800]  guise of parenthood.
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:33.600]  So can you tell us why you support Trump?
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:38.000]  I support Trump because Trump has my best interest in mind and he wants a strong country
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.840]  and we've seen that by him not worrying about black people as a specific group, but just
[01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:44.920]  worrying about the country, he's helped black people.
[01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:47.760]  You see the lowest black unemployment in history.
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:53.440]  You see the lowest Hispanic unemployment in history because Trump has removed the divide
[01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:58.760]  by helping everyone and not being racist about how he helps people.
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:03.400]  Now, have you had any encounters with the protesters out here tonight yet?
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:04.400]  Yes, I have.
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:06.680]  What was that like?
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:12.120]  They were very extremely intolerant and one guy said, I can't believe you're wearing that.
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:13.280]  You know you're black.
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:14.280]  That's what he said to me.
[01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:19.440]  A white guy asked me if I knew I was black and apparently for him, it's not okay for
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:23.480]  a black person to support the president because the president is a racist.
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:28.320]  I, you know, I can't stress enough that every time they say the president is racist, you
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:31.800]  ask them for an example, they bring up these isolated incidents and they say, well, he
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:32.800]  didn't denounce Charlottesville.
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:35.480]  So I said, so if you don't do it down something, you're guilty of it.
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:36.480]  He said, yes.
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:37.480]  I said, that's.
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:38.480]  We're going to go to break.
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:40.480]  But I got to add here, he did denounce both sides.
[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:41.480]  They just lie.
[01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:43.920]  He says all Mexicans are criminals.
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:44.920]  There is no video of that.
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:47.960]  It's like them saying, I say there's human slaves on Mars.
[01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:49.640]  I'd never said anything like that.
[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:50.800]  It's a lie.
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:52.600]  They just lie.
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:53.600]  Powerful video.

[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:18.480]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:23.240]  I am very concerned and I know there are millions of Texans who are concerned about the political
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:29.600]  bias of big tech, of Facebook and Google skewing and silencing the voices of those who politically
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:30.600]  they disagree with.
[01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:35.640]  You may remember several months ago, Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook testified before the Senate
[01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:40.640]  and I asked him a series of vigorous questions about the political bias at Facebook.
[01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:44.200]  Now even though Congress shouldn't regulate the content, there are two things we should
[01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:45.200]  think about doing.
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:51.160]  Number one, right now, big tech enjoys an immunity from liability on the assumption
[01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:52.680]  that they would be neutral and fair.
[01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:56.360]  If they're not going to be neutral and fair, if they're going to be biased, we should repeal
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:07:00.080]  the immunity from liability so they should be liable like the rest of us.
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:05.080]  Number two, the giant tech companies, by any measure, are bigger than AT&T was when it
[01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:08.760]  was broken up under the antitrust laws, bigger than standard oil, and if they're abusing
[01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:16.240]  market powers and monopoly, the antitrust laws should be enforced.
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:23.360]  And that's why we love Ted Cruz.
[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:27.800]  You know, I am such a fan of Ted Cruz and I'm so demonized in mainstream media as something
[01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:29.520]  that would hurt him, but it doesn't.
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:33.920]  That's why I got really mad at him during the campaign when he started getting dirty
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:39.400]  against Trump, the Republic of Establishment, but he has reprieved himself, he has a perfect
[01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:47.120]  voting record, and he probably is the smartest person in the Senate.
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:50.720]  In fact, most of them agree that on top of his class, Supreme Court justices, they worked
[01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:56.120]  under to say that he knows more than they do, he's good to have on our team.
[01:07:56.120 --> 01:08:01.420]  And you compare him to Beto O'Rourke, it is not even the same universe.
[01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:05.320]  That guy is a bumbling, stumbling liar.
[01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:10.280]  He's been involved in a hit and run, just like Chris Cuomo he got away with.
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:13.760]  His mother's a lifelong Democrat, they found it going back decades.
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:17.440]  First they found him voting for Obama 10 years ago and all the rest of it.
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:20.240]  Now they found stuff going back 30 years.
[01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:27.960]  He is a liar, and he has these canned responses up there, and it just is a nightmare situation
[01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:33.120]  to watch them spend more money on him than they would spend a decade ago on a presidential
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:34.120]  race.
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:39.200]  He's raised $36 million in the last month, all total is something like $100 million.
[01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:44.960]  I mean, it's just insane to live in Texas and to see him plastered everywhere and to
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:49.160]  know what a giant stinking fraud he is.
[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:55.400]  But I believe in Texas, and I believe we're going to keep Ted Cruz.
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:09:01.600]  I know I got really, really mad at Ted Cruz, and then I strangely enough ran into him on
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:13.720]  election day, and I ran into him on inauguration day, and I was pretty angry at him at the
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:18.680]  time, but looking back in hindsight, you don't know what you got until it's gone.
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:21.240]  Please God, let Ted Cruz stay in the Senate, please.
[01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:24.040]  They would have gotten gun control bills through if it wasn't for him.
[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:31.080]  He's helped begin to pair back Obamacare, I mean, he's just smart.
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:36.960]  He helped Senator Paul reverse six years ago Obama backing al-Qaeda and then ISIS in Syria
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:39.640]  and blowing the borders of Europe up.
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:45.360]  I mean, Ted Cruz has been one of the critical game changers, and we need him in there.
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:49.880]  And I'm telling you, folks, you need to call all your friends and family.
[01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:54.920]  You need to go and get grandma out of the nursing home and take her to vote, because
[01:09:54.920 --> 01:10:01.520]  coming up next segment, we knew this was going on, but they have caught a ring of Democrats
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:07.280]  going through the list of either dead people on voter rolls, out of the obituaries, or
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:11.120]  people that again are in nursing homes, and then they steal their identity.
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:12.680]  I'm not saying do that.
[01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:16.200]  Go to grandma, go to grandpa, and say, do you like Ted Cruz?
[01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:18.360]  Do you like the Second Amendment?
[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:22.720]  And you know, even if they've got Alzheimer's, if they say yes, you take them down and you
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:25.560]  have them vote.
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:27.040]  That's not cheating in my view.
[01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:28.440]  We don't do what the Democrats do.
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:33.200]  When they go low, we work twice as hard.
[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:39.440]  But you need to absolutely bust your butt.
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:45.120]  And what you also need to do in my humble opinion, please, is, because it's about protecting
[01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:46.120]  Trump.
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:52.160]  And they will impeach him as fast as the sun came up in the morning.
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:53.680]  And you imagine what this is going to be like.
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:55.880]  We have to secure the Republic.
[01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:58.760]  We have to get our industrial base just for national security back.
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:00.240]  We have to do it now.
[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:06.480]  Now speaking of Ted Cruz, and how he got into the Internet censorship that's going on, bottom
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:12.400]  of the hour, I'm going to get into this, and I'm going to open the phones up, Sundar.
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:20.120]  That's the guy's name that heads up Google, has been caught lying repeatedly about censorship.
[01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:24.880]  Well, now because his own engineers are going public and quitting in drugs, we're talking
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:29.440]  top engineers, he's then hiding in plain view saying, oh, it's no big deal.
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:30.440]  Censorship is good.
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:31.440]  It's helpful.
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:32.440]  Yes, of course, we're doing it.
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:33.880]  And we're going to do it here, too.
[01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:39.160]  So they're now doing the hide it in plain view thing, just like the New York Times says,
[01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:45.400]  thank God they're banning MPC memes that just put gray emotionless faces over throngs of
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:49.640]  leftist and memes to show they're a bunch of automatons being programmed.
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:54.080]  That's the symbol of authoritarianism, is a gray face, emotionless.
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:12:03.400]  In 1984, in THX1138, in Apple commercials, in all dystopic systems.
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:09.520]  Well here they are in the New York Times front page saying, get them, get in there and censor.
[01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:14.200]  See notice, I knew the censorship was coming, they already had us dolled back 95%, and nobody
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:15.560]  would stand up to it.
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:22.120]  And so did I try to get banned like they had a Facebook said about me, oh, we think Jones
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:23.120]  wanted to be banned.
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:28.200]  No, I didn't want to be banned, but I wasn't going to self censor.
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:32.800]  So I sat there and had a meeting with my dad, and I told you part of the meeting, but my
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:36.760]  dad works with us here because I can trust him, he does a great job, and he said, man
[01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:38.680]  you're really pushing it, you're going to get banned everywhere.
[01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:42.560]  I said, dad, I'm already banned, and he said, well just don't go further than you would,
[01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:43.560]  don't let them go to you.
[01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:44.720]  And I said, I'm not.
[01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:48.840]  I'm sitting back and thinking about what would I really be saying, and if I've begun
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:53.480]  to govern what I say, not because what I'm saying is not true, but because I don't want
[01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:54.480]  to be censored.
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:57.480]  And I said, I have begun to bend my will.
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:02.480]  And so I'm going to go on air and say what I really think.
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:06.240]  And they're going to ban me before the election.
[01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:09.440]  They're planning after the election to ban everybody publicly.
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:11.000]  They're planning now to just do it quietly.
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.400]  I'm going to force them to ban me.
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:17.600]  And I said, I believe it'll be in the next two weeks, and it was exactly two weeks.
[01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:21.840]  I don't know how I know this stuff, but when I go with my gut and I have this feeling,
[01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:28.400]  I tingle all over, it's like a divining rod, you know, find the water, it just happens.
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:31.240]  And my dad said, well I'm sure it's going to happen.
[01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:33.880]  And it did, boom.
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:38.080]  But I didn't say anything bad or do anything bad.
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:43.560]  They misrepresented what I said and did to get rid of me because they don't want real
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:44.560]  truth being spoken.
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:54.760]  So we're going to come back and get to more of the debate between Beto, Beto, and Ted
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:59.280]  Cruz and just the lies of this guy that you'll hear when we come back.
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:02.960]  And then I'm going to get into China and Google and Apple.
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:06.400]  I mean, do you understand what a threat it is that these companies are openly suppressing
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:13.880]  the Chinese people and now publicly at TV news conferences bragging about it and smiling?
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:20.040]  But see, it's okay because Shandar has dark hair and dark skin.
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:21.240]  And that's the whole leftist thing.
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:27.160]  As long as the person's not white, it's okay.
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:29.360]  And that's the true mental illness of the situation.
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:33.080]  We're going to go to break and come back with all of that.
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:37.440]  But please remember we're having the biggest sale in our history right now because they've
[01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:38.440]  taken PayPal.
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:41.640]  Oh, see, build your own business and they're trying to take our software away and they're
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:44.520]  trying to take everything away.
[01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:46.960]  And they're harassing and threatening and lying about us to do it.
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:50.040]  And saying, Ben Alex Jones, he harasses people on the Internet.
[01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:54.160]  You got George Soros funded groups organizing millions of Democrats to do it saying that
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:57.280]  then we're the ones harassing people online.
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:02.280]  Isn't that just peachy king and doxing everybody and threatening everybody?
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:05.560]  This is a group of knuckle dragging thugs and bullies.
[01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:09.560]  And you don't just get great products that you and your family need at inforstore.com
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:16.720]  and store wide free shipping right now and 50% off all the supplements, all the nutraceuticals.
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:23.440]  You are funding an operation that does have the zeitgeist that is in the pike five by
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:28.080]  five that is dropping bombs directly on the enemy in the information war.
[01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:35.040]  And that has absolutely devastated them and is now dreaded and vaunted and is infamous
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:36.040]  with the enemy.
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:40.560]  I've met with many people that's come out the news at highest level globalist meetings.
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:46.320]  They literally hate my guts because we have the spirit of resistance and victory and renaissance
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:47.320]  and the future.
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:48.720]  And they want to extinguish him for worse.
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:52.680]  So don't let them get in there today and get the best products ever at the lowest price
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:53.680]  ever.
[01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:57.240]  Everything must go inforstore.com.
[01:15:57.240 --> 01:16:02.640]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:03.640]  the world.
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:06.640]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:12.600]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:16.400]  Its former colony, the US, had to save the empire.
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:17.400]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:18.960]  Who do we fight for?
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:21.840]  The deep state began with World War I.
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:27.440]  The United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.

[01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:30.000]  You've heard the phrase, you are what you eat, not true.
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000]  Actually, you are what you can't absorb.
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:35.480]  So if the vitamins and supplements you now take are not being absorbed, what good are
[01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:36.480]  they?

[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:04.960]  and joint support.

[01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:11.920]  Bodies contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:16.280]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:20.440]  It is well known in traditional medicine for exuding properties.
[01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:24.720]  Our pure turmeric extract plus peppering from black pepper makes for optimal absorption

[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:41.880]  But our turmeric root extract contains over 95 percent of the active ingredients.
[01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:47.840]  These combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm and thyme
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:50.720]  to work synergistically for full body support.

[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:46.160]  benefits of a simple formula that contains unmodified, high-quality krill oil concentrate
[01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:49.000]  paired with our ultimate fish oil or used separately.
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:53.200]  It's time to see what krill oil can do for you with Ultimate Krill Oil, now available
[01:19:53.200 --> 01:20:10.400]  at InfoWarsStore.com You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:15.160]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:16.880]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:18.480]  Well, so does he.
[01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:30.320]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:51.160]  All right, here is a highlight reel of Beto versus Cruz.
[01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:56.520]  And when you know the Texas policies and national policies, you know about Beto, like I do living
[01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:57.520]  here in Austin.
[01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:00.840]  The guy is an incredible liar.
[01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:03.960]  He said that El Paso is super safe and there's no crime on the border.
[01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:06.920]  That's all coming up and the border is not a big issue.
[01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:10.120]  I mean, Mexico has hundreds of thousands dead.
[01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:14.000]  It's a beautiful country in many areas, nice people in many areas, but much of it is a
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:18.320]  war zone most dangerous country in the world.
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:19.320]  But I'm digressing.
[01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:25.360]  When I was a kid, we used to go down to the border.
[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:29.320]  It's not safe anywhere, not even in Big Bend anymore.
[01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:35.360]  And that's in the middle of nowhere, 500 miles from any town of any size.
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:36.360]  It's dangerous as hell.
[01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:41.560]  But let's go ahead and get this compilation because this Senate race is so critical.
[01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:43.080]  Here it is.
[01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:47.000]  Our junior senator will not stand up to President Trump.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.440]  Someone who apologizes for Russia, defends that country.
[01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:54.840]  Vladimir Putin, the leader of the country that sought to undermine our democracy.
[01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:56.240]  He won't stand up against him.
[01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:59.440]  He won't stand up for us to make sure that our election.
[01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:01.160]  People always ask me if I've trained in NLP.
[01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:02.760]  I've been doing this for 20 years.
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:05.040]  I went and looked it up 20 years ago.
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:06.760]  It's basically in marketing and stuff.
[01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:11.440]  It's these cadences and how people talk and then terms they use to highlight things.
[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:14.480]  No, I'm not trained professionally in any of that.
[01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:17.440]  I'm trained in telling the truth and I talk the way I talk.
[01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:22.120]  A lot of people will notice I make hand gestures like Trump does and I mean, these are all
[01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:24.920]  well-known gestures, just things I do naturally.
[01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:31.240]  But Beto O'Rourke, do you notice with him it is NLP and Trump isn't professionally trained.
[01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:34.760]  He's trained in the streets of persuasion and the truth.
[01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:39.920]  But you look at Beto, he's trying to sound like Obama with the cadence and the way he's
[01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:43.440]  saying it and the whole thing is disgusting.
[01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:45.360]  That's why they're calling him the new Obama.
[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:47.520]  Yes, they don't just want him in the Senate.
[01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:50.160]  They think this guy is going to be the next president.
[01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:57.800]  I mean, another blue blood establishment trying to pose like a real person when he never built
[01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:02.360]  anything in his life and his mother's a lifelong Democrat, but to trick Republicans to vote
[01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:05.640]  for him that my mom was a Republican, but she's voting for me.
[01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:08.120]  You are a lying piece of garbage.
[01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:11.160]  You say you want to ban all semi-auto rifles in Texas.
[01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:12.440]  You want open borders.
[01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:14.440]  You are an enemy of this country.
[01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:17.680]  You are a globalist piece of filth with a chai comms.
[01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:20.280]  You make me sick.
[01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:22.640]  Anyways, just looking at it makes me want to vomit.
[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:23.640]  He's so fake.
[01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:27.680]  Only though he's a frat boy, blue blood chicken necks, carpet bagging down here in Texas.
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:29.160]  Go back to him.
[01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:33.800]  For us to make sure that our elections are free and fair, that your vote goes to the
[01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:35.560]  intended candidate.
[01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:38.600]  This is beyond party politics.
[01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:42.120]  This is getting our democracy back on track and we need a...
[01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:43.120]  Our country's on track.
[01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:44.120]  It paused.
[01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:47.680]  It's the Democrats trying to censor all the Republicans and all the conservatives and all
[01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:48.680]  the Christians.
[01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:49.680]  It's the Democrats threatening everybody.
[01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:52.520]  But you talk about our democracy's under threat.
[01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:54.760]  You are the threat, you little piece of crap.
[01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:56.760]  Sorry, just go back to him.
[01:23:56.760 --> 01:23:57.760]  We'll do that.
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:01.920]  I was proud to help lead the effort to confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.
[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:06.800]  I was proud to help lead the effort to confirm Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the court.
[01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:10.400]  Congressman O'Rourke would have voted against both of them and he wants to see, like Hillary
[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:18.000]  Clinton promised to appoint left-wing judicial activists who impose their own policy preferences
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.000]  from the bench.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.440]  I don't think that's what the people of Texas want.
[01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:25.240]  We want judges and justices who will follow the Constitution and follow the law.
[01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:28.920]  This is what you can expect over the course of this debate.
[01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:30.600]  Senator Cruz is not going to be honest with you.
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:31.600]  He's going to...
[01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:35.040]  I mean, even mainstream news admits he talks like Obama, which is totally fake talk.
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:40.560]  This video is Obama in the 80s and 90s, doesn't sound like that, it's this big voice like
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:41.560]  this, almost like Bernie Sanders.
[01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:45.800]  I am of the authority, white people don't know what it's like to be poor.
[01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:46.800]  Yeah, there it is, MarketWatch.
[01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:52.320]  Beto O'Rourke hailed as Obama-like for President 2020.
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:54.720]  Both never did anything in their lives.
[01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:58.480]  Both look like they could suck a golf ball through a garden hose.
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:00.840]  Both us comebacks that hate the country.
[01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:01.840]  Let's go back to...
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:05.200]  They both look like they have Mr. Ed Teeth.
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:10.600]  Oh, well, boy, if you bred Beto O'Rourke with Stormy Daniels, you would actually have a
[01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:11.600]  real horse.
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:15.800]  Well, wait, if you breed a jackass, a donkey with a horse, you'd get a mule.
[01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:16.800]  You'd have a mule.
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:18.600]  They'd have a little baby mule.
[01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:21.000]  Oh, get both of them off the screen.
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:22.000]  I'm sorry.
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.920]  Oh, I'm so sick of these fakes.
[01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:25.920]  Go back to Pito.
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:28.920]  I mean, yeah, Pito O'Rourke, here it is.
[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:29.920]  Going to be honest with you.
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:34.600]  You're going to make up positions and votes that I've never held or have ever taken.
[01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:35.600]  He's dishonest.
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:36.600]  It's why the president called him that.
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:37.600]  You're dishonest.
[01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:38.600]  You're dishonest.
[01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:39.600]  You let...
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:40.600]  I said, stop.
[01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:41.600]  Go back to him.
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:42.600]  Ted.
[01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:45.400]  And it's why the nickname stuck because it's true.
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:47.920]  Congressman O'Rourke not only opposes a wall.
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:48.920]  He paused again.
[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:49.920]  Back to that for a second.
[01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:54.280]  Trump said line Ted about things that happened in the campaign.
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:56.000]  Ted Cruz has always kept his promise about votes.
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:57.000]  That's what matters.
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:58.040]  And he did make me mad.
[01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:01.800]  He did do some flip-flopping in the campaign and things he said about Trump.
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:07.360]  But the don'ts sit there and use Trump's quotes, Bito, when Trump has endorsed Ted Cruz.
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:11.960]  It doesn't fit when you're a Democrat saying that to Ted Cruz when Trump has endorsed Ted
[01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:12.960]  Cruz.
[01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:14.480]  We've got to get a nickname.
[01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:16.680]  It just looks like a big fat pedophile to me.
[01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:18.520]  I mean, most Democrats are anyways at that level.
[01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:19.520]  So who knows?
[01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:21.920]  I say guilt by association.
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:23.880]  He's probably not a pedophile.
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:24.880]  Let's just...
[01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:25.880]  He just looks like one.
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:26.880]  Let's go back to him.
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:28.280]  Because it's true.
[01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:33.480]  Congressman O'Rourke not only opposes a wall, but he has said we have too many fences and
[01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:34.760]  walls already on the border.
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:36.280]  He wants to tear down the ones we have.
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:38.640]  And I'll note, he brought up El Paso.
[01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:43.720]  El Paso is right across from Juarez, one of the most dangerous cities in the world,
[01:26:43.720 --> 01:26:45.440]  3,000 murders last year.
[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:46.840]  There's a wall there.
[01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:50.000]  That wall is one of the tools you use to protect us.
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:54.120]  All you heard from Senator Cruz is what we should be afraid of.
[01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:56.440]  It's a campaign based on fear.
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:27:00.440]  It's the same person who shut down the government of the United States of America for 16 days
[01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:03.960]  perhaps because he thought too many people had too much health care.
[01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:04.960]  Has...
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:05.960]  Hit pause again.
[01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:08.520]  Obamacare ripped everybody off in triple prices.
[01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:12.440]  The Democrats shut down the government all the time to get what they want.
[01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:13.440]  Let's continue.
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:18.960]  We need to take away health care from millions of American families and vows to repeal protections
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:20.480]  for pre-existing conditions.
[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:22.600]  I want people to have more health care.
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:25.800]  I want people to be well enough to finish their education, to go to school.
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:27.800]  I want to bring people of Texas together.
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:28.800]  This is Bernie Leichler.
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:29.800]  This is Bernie Leichler.
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:30.800]  And Democrats are like...
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:31.800]  Everything's free.
[01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:32.800] ...to all parts of this state.
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:33.800]  It's free.
[01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:36.180]  To make sure that we meet on an issue that we understand better than anyone else.
[01:27:36.180 --> 01:27:41.320]  If we are reducing the barriers, whether it is to Mexico or Canada or China or anywhere
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:44.160]  else, so we're selling more, that's a good thing.
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:48.360]  If we're erecting barriers and shutting down trade, that is a bad thing.
[01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:53.200]  Really interesting to hear you talk about a partisan circus after your last six years
[01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:55.200]  in the U.S. Senate.
[01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:59.200]  If you have this special relationship with...
[01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:00.680]  Hit pause again.
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:04.160]  They're the ones that lied with all the fake stuff and they got beaten.
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:05.160]  They were the circus.
[01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:08.000]  Not the Republicans continue.
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.680]  Then where is the result of that?
[01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:13.440]  You are all talk and no action.
[01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:17.760]  The tariffs that the president has levied, the trade wars that he has entered this country
[01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:21.400]  into, is hurting no state more than it's hurting Texas.
[01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:25.960]  Our farmers, our ranchers, our producers, our manufacturers, and our exporters.
[01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:31.520]  I think the lowest point we have seen is the confirmation hearings for Justice Kavanaugh,
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:39.280]  where we saw Senate Democrats be willing to smear Judge Kavanaugh and his family, be willing
[01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:44.680]  to repeat unsupported, uncorroborated allegations and go after him in a way that I thought was
[01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:45.680]  shameful.
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:49.200]  It was important that that process be fair, that Dr. Ford get a forward teller to be...
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:51.400]  When we better elect Ted Cruz to the Senate.
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:57.480]  This is a national emergency if he's not elected.
[01:28:57.480 --> 01:29:00.280]  Ever wonder how Bitcoin and Ethereum were created?
[01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:05.200]  Versel Media has helped hundreds of companies and individuals make their own cryptocurrency.
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:09.320]  Decentralized blockchain solutions are making the world more transparent and giving power
[01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:10.720]  back to the people.
[01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:15.360]  Versel Media has helped companies raise tens of millions in the past year alone, structuring

[01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:28.800]  Hear that?
[01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:34.320]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:37.280]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:40.800]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:10.880]  Believe me, I know I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright

[01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:26.360]  the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern-day lifestyle with

[01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:33.720]  You know, Beto O'Rourke wants to ban semi-autos, Beto O'Rourke wants open borders, Beto O'Rourke
[01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:36.520]  wants to put globalist communist types on the Supreme Court.
[01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:38.080]  That's enough to vote against him.
[01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:42.880]  And it's not fair to, you know, say he's a pedophile and that's not what I'm saying.
[01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:48.120]  I'm saying if I was casting a creepy pervert or somebody like run a mortuary or something
[01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:52.680]  that like kidnaps kids and eats them or something for a horror movie with Halloween coming up,
[01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:56.160]  I would, I would have him working in the ghoul shop.
[01:33:56.160 --> 01:34:02.640]  He wouldn't be the head guy, but Beto O'Rourke, Beto O'Rourke, he would be definitely working
[01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:03.640]  in the House of Horrors.
[01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:06.040]  Now, who would be the head guy?
[01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:07.040]  Brian Stelter.
[01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:13.320]  I mean, I don't think Brian Stelter is a pedophile, but he looks like the subway founder who is
[01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:14.320]  one.
[01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:15.960]  And so many of these guys have that look.
[01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:22.160]  You know, the Peto look like salon and, and, and vice worships pedophilia now.
[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:26.720]  And they say how great it is all the time and say, you know, it's good for this to happen
[01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:27.720]  to kids.
[01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:30.160]  They have a right for men to come pick your daughter or son up.
[01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:35.480]  And so all I'm saying is central casting folks, central casting, these guys look like
[01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:39.440]  slimy pieces of crap that you wouldn't let get anywhere near your children.
[01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:42.600]  Of course, they want to abort your children before they're born.
[01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:45.000]  They want to kill your children if they could before they're born.
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:48.880]  And they want to feed them GMO and give them deadly vaccines.
[01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:54.280]  But we have attacks rolling in of GOP headquarters, getting firebomb, getting attacked with rape
[01:34:54.280 --> 01:34:57.320]  sprayed on them, people getting beat up, people getting shot.
[01:34:57.320 --> 01:35:01.160]  I mean, you know about all of it and it's coming in so fast, we're almost getting numb
[01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:02.160]  to it.
[01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:05.960]  But there have been new firebombing attacks, knife attacks all over Europe.
[01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:08.160]  I haven't even covered them the last three days.
[01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:11.840]  There's like three or four attacks today without me looking for them.
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:18.880]  It's in here, hostage taking, firebombing, shooting, hang grenades, stabbings, mass rapes.
[01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:21.120]  And here's another one.
[01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:25.920]  It's out of Free Beacon, two GOP candidates assaulted in Minnesota, attacks come as state
[01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:29.920]  Democrats suspend staffer for beheading post.
[01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:33.320]  Minnesota Democratic Party has suspended a spokesman recalling for violence as Republicans,
[01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:37.440]  even as two GOP candidates have been assaulted and suspected politically motivated attacks.
[01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:41.400]  And remember, you had the editor of Raw Story, when Congressman Scalicia barely survived the
[01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:46.440]  shooting, where they tried to kill 17 members of the Republican conservative caucus.
[01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:48.440]  That would really thrown things in a disarray if he'd been successful.
[01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:51.760]  He was screaming, you're going to kill me taking my health care away because you heard
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:52.960]  that on the news.
[01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:55.520]  And CNN said the guy was a hero.
[01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:56.520]  Remember that?
[01:35:56.520 --> 01:36:03.560]  And now the head of Raw Story, one of the main editors said, weird self-defense for
[01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:10.720]  shootings, police, the Democratic Farmer Labor Party has sub bended communication staffer
[01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:14.440]  William Davis for a week without being paid for making a Facebook post, joking that Democrats
[01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:19.040]  would bring Republicans to the guillotine on November 17th, the day after the midterm
[01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:20.040]  elections.
[01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:26.920]  You know, the big Trotskyite Neocon crystals on record telling people that we're going
[01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:28.800]  to be sent to guillotines and stuff.
[01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:33.160]  Minnesota Republican Party Chairman Jennifer Carnahan said the suspension was not enough,
[01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:37.640]  calling for immediate firing in the aftermath of a separate attacks against Republican candidates.
[01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:41.200]  She said she has been subjected to numerous death threats during her tenure at the party
[01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:44.920]  leader and the death threats are no laughing matter.
[01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:48.520]  And then it gets into the violent attacks and all the rest of people saying we're going
[01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:50.520]  to kill you.
[01:36:50.520 --> 01:36:51.880]  So that's who these people are.
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:53.480]  They want to bully everybody.
[01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:59.920]  Meanwhile, they got medical reports and police reports about, you know, the favorite guy
[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:04.640]  they've got there in Minnesota, who's a Democrat.
[01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:07.680]  Steve Ellison, but because there's so much evidence, well, you're not going to hear a
[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:08.680]  thing out of them.
[01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:12.680]  Just like Hillary came out and defended Bill Clinton and said it was consensual.
[01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:18.560]  And that, you know, because Monica Lewinsky was a grown woman, it's okay.
[01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:24.800]  But you say somebody over a woman hitting on him is bad, which I think it's consensual.
[01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:25.800]  It's not.
[01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:28.960]  But I think putting pressure on somebody or over being male or female is bad.
[01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:34.600]  But the idea that Bill Clinton and all his rapes he settled and all the rest of it is
[01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:35.600]  okay.
[01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:36.600]  It's not okay.
[01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:39.200]  And it just shows how hypocritical and out of control these people are.
[01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:44.280]  But speaking of Pito or Rourke, I'm sorry, it's beta or Rourke.
[01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:45.280]  I've missed this.
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:51.760]  I mean, when you got a name like beta, it's easy to say Pito or Rourke or wait, wait, wait.
[01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:53.680]  It's not beta or Rourke.
[01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:54.680]  It's not Pito or Rourke.
[01:37:54.680 --> 01:37:55.680]  Oh, it's Pito.
[01:37:55.680 --> 01:37:56.680]  Pito.
[01:37:56.680 --> 01:37:57.680]  Pito or Rourke.
[01:37:57.680 --> 01:38:03.240]  Well, I'm having a problem on transmitter then.
[01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:04.240]  Can somebody come in here?
[01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:05.240]  I'm breaking up.
[01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:06.240]  What's his name?
[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:07.240]  Sometimes I have like this moment.
[01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:08.240]  It's a mental block.
[01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:15.320]  Pito or Rourke, beta or Rourke, lyre or Rourke, chicken neck or Rourke, carpet bag or Rourke,
[01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:17.320]  scallywag or Rourke.
[01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:21.400]  I mean, I don't care if you move to Texas as long as you're not a communist or a socialist.
[01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:22.960]  If you're fleeing California, that's great.
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:24.320]  Just don't bring it here.
[01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:32.720]  But when your family is a bunch of fake Texans and you talk like Obama mixed with Bernie Sanders,
[01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:35.800]  let's get out of my state, you scumbag.
[01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:39.920]  But excuse me, there's a lot of famous lies out there.
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:43.760]  One of them that you've been hearing since the 50s was New York City has the best water
[01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:44.760]  in the world.
[01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:48.160]  And you see signs up to this day saying how good it tastes.
[01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:51.840]  It tastes like rancid monkey piss.
[01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:52.840]  That's like Houston's water.
[01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:54.120]  It tastes like kerosene.
[01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:55.120]  You could light on fire.
[01:38:55.120 --> 01:38:56.120]  It's so toxic still.
[01:38:56.120 --> 01:38:58.280]  I wouldn't drink it if I was you.
[01:38:58.280 --> 01:39:01.680]  I had a lot of family lived in Houston and all of us that don't live in Houston don't
[01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:03.800]  die of cancer early and everybody else does.
[01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:09.680]  Anyways, a lot of famous landfills and things that houses are built on down there.
[01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:15.560]  And so they're always saying, oh, we have the best water in cities that have bad water.
[01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:22.200]  Well El Paso has been one of the most dangerous cities in the country, not just Texas forever.
[01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:25.480]  Since the days of outlaws where people ran down to Mexico and ran back and forth across
[01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:31.320]  the border, it has been shoot them up, whorehouse, gambling, Wild Wild West, got a bunch of military
[01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:33.640]  bases there.
[01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:36.960]  And technically how they do it is they do a survey right around the base and then say
[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:40.760]  we have low crime, but it has one of the highest crime rates in the country, but they have
[01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:45.640]  the slogan, safest city in the United States.
[01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:47.520]  But it's a lie.
[01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:59.520]  So Beta O'Rourke, Pito O'Rourke running against Ted Cruz, what is his name, Beto, Beto.
[01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:06.480]  What's the name of the cow, Bevo is his name, Bevo O'Rourke, Bevo O'Rourke, I'm going to
[01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:14.080]  get it right here in a minute, Bevo O'Rourke, Pito, Pito, Beta O'Rourke is a liar and here
[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:16.080]  he is getting caught in the line.
[01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:21.880]  In El Paso, Texas, one half of the largest bi-national community on the border, the defining border
[01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:22.880]  community.
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:26.080]  We care about our kids' safety, I care about the safety of those that I represent in Congress,
[01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:29.720]  I care about the safety of every single person in the state of Texas.
[01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:34.520]  El Paso, in fact, is one of, not the safest cities in the United States of America, because
[01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:38.920]  we have rural class law enforcement, police and sheriff's deputies, but it's also because
[01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:40.600]  we are a city of immigrants.
[01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:43.880]  A quarter of those that I represent were born in a country.
[01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:47.760]  Another country chose us, came here to this country and by their very presence made it
[01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:48.760]  better.
[01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:54.000]  No wall is going to solve legitimate security concerns, but God's smart policy will.
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:59.920]  By the way, I bet that Pito O'Rourke, I bet he's got a wall around his house, has anybody
[01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:00.920]  checked that?
[01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:05.200]  Has anybody gone to Ding Dong's house or he might have moved out of that one if it's
[01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:06.200]  got a wall moved to another?
[01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:10.600]  I mean, I've got a wall around my house, it's not even afraid, but you know, I got cats,
[01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:12.400]  I got dogs.
[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:16.600]  Cats just jump over the wall, but wow, I'm going to stop getting into that.
[01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:20.040]  I said I'd take calls, I haven't given the number out yet and we do not have a guest
[01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:21.040]  in the third hour.
[01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:25.840]  Adam's I think is hosting the fourth hour, we got a lot coming up today.
[01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:29.480]  I haven't gotten to robot security forces on patrol in New York City, prompt prophecy
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:33.440]  concerns for some and so much more coming up next hour and a bunch of other clips I
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:37.280]  haven't gotten to yet and I'm having some fun with Bito.
[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:41.120]  He wants to rape our freedom and we need to stand against that.
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:46.080]  So we're going to be breaking it all down coming up and opening the phones up when we
[01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:47.080]  start the next hour.
[01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:52.760]  In fact, let me do that now, let's go ahead and give that number out now to talk about
[01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:56.000]  any subject you want, anything you want to get into.
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:59.880]  It's a total free for all longtime callers, first-time callers, anybody that was left
[01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:02.240]  on hold yesterday when the show ended, I'll go right to you.
[01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:06.040]  I'm going to take a ton of calls next hour, did a good job yesterday, like 20 calls, that's
[01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:13.720]  a lot for me, 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231 was the old GCN number, so you can't call that
[01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:15.200]  one teleprompter free.
[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:25.120]  You got to call this one, 877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex, that's 877-789-2539, when you give the same
[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:31.560]  number out for 20 years, it gets hard to remember the new one, 877-789-2539, and don't forget,
[01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:36.120]  it's your chance to get Christmas and Black Friday and Cyber Monday all at once, because
[01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:39.880]  we're trying to take our payment processors, I think we're getting some backups, but we
[01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:44.200]  got one left right now and so everybody needs to get in there at m4store.com, your payment
[01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:49.760]  comes through, it shipped out to you at m4store.com, 50% off and free shipping, free shipping
[01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:54.720]  store-wide, 50% off on the supplements, it's all there, act now and funding in Fulwark,
[01:42:54.720 --> 01:42:57.400]  stay with us.
[01:42:57.400 --> 01:43:02.480]  X2, we were selling it for about three years and then they found out how big it was and
[01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:05.880]  how much we were buying, and they said, oh we want more money, more money, and oh this
[01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:11.840]  and that, and so I've broken my contract, and right now we can't get more of this proprietary
[01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:15.620]  ingredient that goes in X2, that literally is so pure that if you put it in a picker
[01:43:15.620 --> 01:43:21.360]  dish on top of 90 degree hot plate, it gasses, like I dream of genie, and it's purple gas,
[01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:25.280]  I mean that is so pure, it just goes right into your body when you take it, we're working
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:30.520]  on trying to get other suppliers right now, but I bought a huge amount of it, ordered
[01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:34.880]  it six months ago, so I get the price down, I said if you don't lower it, I'm done, I'm
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:39.680]  breaking the contract, but I broke the contract last week, and so this is potentially the
[01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:45.000]  last run, in fact right now it is the last run of survival shield X2, and we've got a
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:49.240]  good supply of it, it'll be gone in a couple of months, X2, if you haven't experienced
[01:43:49.240 --> 01:43:53.280]  it, m4store.com, if you have experienced it and how great it is, I suggest you stop up
[01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:57.280]  on it, it's available right now for a limited time, m4store.com, right now.
[01:43:57.280 --> 01:44:02.360]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:06.880]  InfoWords is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, left to CIA operatives, the corrupt
[01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:11.680]  justice department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate, people say why would you start
[01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:16.440]  a fight with them, because they were already dominating and running America into the ground,
[01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:21.400]  and I knew we had no future if we didn't do this, so we've already had incredible success,
[01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:26.160]  but if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is
[01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:30.800]  and why we've been made the main target, and if you financially support us, and if you
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:36.400]  spread the word about our articles and videos, m4store.com, we won't just continue to stand
[01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:39.840]  up against these brutal scumbags, we'll win.
[01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:44.440]  We have huge sales at m4store.com right now, and we're still able to operate the shopping
[01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:48.040]  cart against stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact that we're trying to block our commerce,
[01:44:48.040 --> 01:44:51.840]  and you're right to the market, but if you don't stand up and support us financially,
[01:44:51.840 --> 01:44:55.880]  Soros and the globe will stay with you, this is m4's darkest hour, we're here to support,
[01:44:55.880 --> 01:44:58.160]  I'm counting on you.
[01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:03.280]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is, the real drama can be found
[01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:08.360]  here in Leilani Estates, but a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater, and we need
[01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:11.480]  to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:45:11.480 --> 01:45:17.320]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles, and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:18.840]  to unhealthy levels.
[01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:25.360]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:29.360]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:30.760]  in the rainwater.
[01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:36.040]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter, and not only were the heavy
[01:45:36.040 --> 01:45:42.120]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:47.760]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:53.080]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:57.760]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:45:57.760 --> 01:46:04.120]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging
[01:46:04.120 --> 01:46:10.520]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:17.760]  or videos or other material from infowarstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:22.680]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer, and so it is essential that you purchase the products
[01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:26.760]  at infowarstore.com, and I want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:31.600]  toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine, and you cannot
[01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:32.600]  beat that.
[01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:36.400]  For children and adults, we've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my
[01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:43.560]  dad, the colloidal silver and iodine as well, infowarslife.com, or AAA2533139, and your
[01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:48.360]  purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against
[01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:51.880]  the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies, and that's who they are, and they
[01:46:51.880 --> 01:46:58.880]  know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:38.880]  It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart, without saying a word, you can light
[01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:42.320]  up the dark.
[01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:48.840]  I want you to have a great future, but I see the average person that means well wants
[01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:57.720]  to work hard and loves God, being taken advantage of, I get angry, and so I decided to take
[01:47:57.720 --> 01:48:04.240]  on the tyrants, because I believe in you, and I knew history, and I knew at first it's
[01:48:04.240 --> 01:48:09.240]  always hard to stand up in the beginning of Patriots of Scarce Man, hated and feared,
[01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:14.280]  scorned, but when it's cause succeeds, the Tim would join him because then it costs nothing
[01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:15.400]  to be a patriot.
[01:48:15.400 --> 01:48:22.880]  It was true when Mark Twain said that 150 years ago, and it's true now.
[01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:29.760]  I want to make something very, very clear, because the most popular thing that the establishment
[01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:34.520]  media puts out against me, they do a lot of things, but one of the most common things
[01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:39.160]  they do, it's not about me, it's understanding their mindset and what they think of you.
[01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:43.600]  The propaganda is targeting you, so when I'm talking about me, it's so you can understand
[01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:48.560]  why they want to shut us down, what it is we're doing that's got their number, why
[01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:55.000]  this weapon system, the temple wars, the truth, scares them so much.
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:49:00.480]  It's because they always go, ha ha, you're getting banned, ha ha, you're getting sued,
[01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:05.440]  ha ha, you're getting ridiculed.
[01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:09.880]  If I liked the current swamp and corrupt globalist system running America, I would have gone
[01:49:09.880 --> 01:49:16.080]  and joined it if I was an evil person or a bad person or a weak person or wanted power
[01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:17.880]  for power sake.
[01:49:17.880 --> 01:49:25.560]  I'm here believing that promoting real freedom and real justice is the best thing for myself
[01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:28.640]  and my family and your family, but I'm not telling you what to do, I'm just saying let
[01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:32.120]  me be free, let me have my free speech.
[01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:37.520]  And guess what, we've been winning the culture war on every front, so the power structure
[01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:39.400]  doesn't know what to do.
[01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:47.240]  They want to shut us up and they shut me down and they start shutting everybody else down
[01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:52.720]  and the internal polls still show a red wave and you've got nationalist and patriots being
[01:49:52.720 --> 01:50:01.120]  elected every week their elections in Latin America and in Asia and in Central Europe,
[01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:08.520]  Eastern Europe, Western Europe, in Africa and people are going for nationalist free market
[01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:15.200]  Trump types and you don't think Trump invented Americana and Renaissance and free market.
[01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:21.960]  No, he just believes in it and he's a salesman, he's selling it and he told you, you buy
[01:50:21.960 --> 01:50:27.640]  into this, it'll be a lot better for you and your family and he hadn't even got us out
[01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:34.240]  of the showroom yet and things are already better, doesn't mean it's perfect.
[01:50:34.240 --> 01:50:35.400]  So it's the same thing.
[01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:40.000]  I really believe in freedom and I don't like globalist, I don't like Michael Moore, I don't
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:44.160]  like Mika Brzezinski, I don't like Hillary Clinton, I don't like Bill Clinton, I don't
[01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:49.280]  like Barack Obama, I don't like his evil wife, I don't like the Blue Blood Republicans,
[01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:57.000]  I don't like Juncker and I don't like Xi and I don't like any of these people because
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.760]  they're out to get their own population.
[01:50:59.760 --> 01:51:05.320]  They set up the economy so the general public doesn't get any money or infrastructure or
[01:51:05.320 --> 01:51:07.480]  a foothold.
[01:51:07.480 --> 01:51:11.760]  Only the select elite get it because they do that on purpose so they don't have any competition
[01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:16.760]  because they get off on keeping people down and then they sit up there and run their mouths
[01:51:16.760 --> 01:51:22.080]  all day about how they really want to empower the average person.
[01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:27.080]  America for all its faults and all its problems was the vanguard, the end of the first wave
[01:51:27.080 --> 01:51:28.080]  of the Renaissance.
[01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:33.000]  It was us reaching for something beautiful and something egalitarian and something good,
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:37.720]  been voting, minorities treated fairly, slavery abolished.
[01:51:37.720 --> 01:51:44.360]  We did all that and then somehow they take our strength, who we are.
[01:51:44.360 --> 01:51:54.440]  And the Christian, Judaic Christian ethos and they turn it on its head and make us hate
[01:51:54.440 --> 01:51:58.960]  ourselves because we have a conscience.
[01:51:58.960 --> 01:52:06.560]  So the profound thing I'm trying to get across here and this is profound is I did not come
[01:52:06.560 --> 01:52:13.640]  to the airwaves and do all this to win popularity contest with the establishment.
[01:52:13.640 --> 01:52:16.080]  I came to get you to believe in yourself.
[01:52:16.080 --> 01:52:21.880]  I came on air to really tell you how I felt and what I'd read in history, what I'd experienced
[01:52:21.880 --> 01:52:25.240]  in life and that I want to be with you in the future.
[01:52:25.240 --> 01:52:26.680]  I want your children to be with my children.
[01:52:26.680 --> 01:52:28.320]  I love you.
[01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:29.440]  And that's not some corny thing.
[01:52:29.440 --> 01:52:31.800]  I do love you.
[01:52:31.800 --> 01:52:32.800]  I love your struggles.
[01:52:32.800 --> 01:52:33.800]  I love your dreams.
[01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:34.800]  I love your hopes.
[01:52:34.800 --> 01:52:37.800]  We're in this together, man.
[01:52:37.800 --> 01:52:40.720]  And they know that we're collectivist as real Christians that love God.
[01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:45.760]  We are collectivist, but we're individualist in our freedom and free will God gave us.
[01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:48.560]  We don't need to have governments and systems that run it.
[01:52:48.560 --> 01:52:52.120]  Goodness rises to the top when it's allowed to flourish and then you have a real contest
[01:52:52.120 --> 01:52:57.920]  of liberty that empowers the species and then it lifts everyone up through individual
[01:52:57.920 --> 01:53:07.840]  collectivism, a term I've coined, which is the real universe.
[01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:11.240]  They created artificial collectivism that is the opposite.
[01:53:11.240 --> 01:53:14.960]  It's total centralized control enslaving those under it.
[01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:20.320]  Slavery is not collectivism.
[01:53:20.320 --> 01:53:24.160]  You look at businesses, you look at militaries, you look at companies, you look at groups
[01:53:24.160 --> 01:53:29.960]  that are really successful, they have a code of conduct, they believe in something, they
[01:53:29.960 --> 01:53:34.200]  have a goal and it's all about being honorable because you don't want to have to look over
[01:53:34.200 --> 01:53:40.680]  your shoulder and it creates kinship, it creates honor, it creates will, it creates destiny,
[01:53:40.680 --> 01:53:45.520]  it creates incubation chambers of children and their children that if they're kept on
[01:53:45.520 --> 01:53:55.920]  that path of Spartan culture unleashes human potential that is unlimited.
[01:53:55.920 --> 01:53:59.680]  But you look at globalism and the decadent disease that's pumped into our society, our
[01:53:59.680 --> 01:54:03.320]  civilizations and it's pure death.
[01:54:03.320 --> 01:54:10.040]  And I don't sit up here on some high horse on the mountain telling you about prosperity
[01:54:10.040 --> 01:54:13.520]  produces monsters, adversity produces men.
[01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:18.320]  The paradox is freedom produces incredible prosperity and the cycle of corruption begins
[01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:22.920]  again and if we're ever going to save humanity we have to learn the cycle and learn the pitfalls
[01:54:22.920 --> 01:54:28.840]  and learn about evil and evil, the devil's good at advertising evil like wanting the
[01:54:28.840 --> 01:54:33.720]  hot cheerleader and the devil tattoo of the devil cheerleader, you think damn the devil
[01:54:33.720 --> 01:54:38.560]  looks good, the devil doesn't look like that, the devil's dead cities and rotting bodies
[01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:43.040]  and flies and failure and betrayal.
[01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:47.800]  God gave you the sexy beautiful women, God gave you the food, God gave you the lightning
[01:54:47.800 --> 01:54:54.280]  in your eyes, God gave you everything, the universe, not the devil and so all I'm saying
[01:54:54.280 --> 01:55:00.560]  is this, God gave us family, God gave us life, God gave us men and women, God gave us children,
[01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:04.880]  God gave us the animals and the fish and the birds of the air, God gave us everything as
[01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:12.120]  the potential of what we could be and the enemy ever seeks to shut all that down and
[01:55:12.120 --> 01:55:16.360]  to make you go into their artificial reality like Zuckerberg walking at his conference
[01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:20.480]  with thousands of his employees all wearing AI goggles hunched over in his world but
[01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:25.280]  not him, he doesn't let his kids wear virtual reality goggles, he doesn't let them have
[01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:34.200]  iPads, he doesn't have a quote bought assistance in his house because he has free will and
[01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:40.160]  the vampire tricked you to take him into the home, it's all a big joke to Zuckerberg walking
[01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:46.240]  amongst his slaves and if you trust him you're a dumb effort in his own words so we'll start
[01:55:46.240 --> 01:55:50.280]  the next hour, get to all your calls and get to a lot more that I haven't gotten to yet,
[01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:55.520]  Facebook's now removing mainline veterans groups pages, they don't want anybody to have support,
[01:55:55.520 --> 01:55:58.560]  they don't want the nation to have anything that makes people feel good and not commit
[01:55:58.560 --> 01:56:03.800]  suicide like the veterans, they don't want anything for you out in the sea of a rock
[01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:10.240]  or an island to get refuge because they're demoralizing us, they're running a psychological
[01:56:10.240 --> 01:56:17.720]  warfare program that the communist Chinese fund which the communist Chinese then ban.
[01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:21.440]  The media, their funding and the very Hollywood they fund from their own country because they're
[01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:28.480]  given us a snake bite and then another snake bite but it didn't kill us so now they're
[01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:33.440]  pumping all their poison into us and it's not working because we're conscious.
[01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:38.000]  We're gonna come back and break it all down and get into Google, they're incredible admissions
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:41.280]  that they lied to Congress, this is just so devastating and the game they're playing
[01:56:41.280 --> 01:56:44.880]  and the way to stop big tech and the fraud they're engaged in that we're so close to
[01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:52.960]  and if we win the power of free speech back in the internet, commons in the internet town
[01:56:52.960 --> 01:56:57.640]  square then we have victory, this is one of the most important critical issues but first
[01:56:57.640 --> 01:57:02.120]  is getting right with God and loving life and loving the unborn and ending that satanic
[01:57:02.120 --> 01:57:07.120]  sacrament that powers this whole system and then next the stars are ours but first we
[01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:09.120]  have to transcend this level.
[01:57:09.120 --> 01:57:16.040]  Now that said we also need funding in the third dimension and that's why we have products
[01:57:16.040 --> 01:57:20.840]  that empower you, water filtration, air filtration, supplements, t-shirts spread the word, everything
[01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:25.440]  we have is a win-win for you at great prices and without you this operation will be shut
[01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:29.960]  down, infowarstore.com, biggest sale in our history, Christmas, Black Friday all rolled
[01:57:29.960 --> 01:57:34.860]  into one, Cyber Monday, 50% off free shipping, store-wide free shipping and the 10% off
[01:57:34.860 --> 01:57:41.080]  ridership stays in place, infowarstore.com or triple A 253-3139, hour number three and
[01:57:41.080 --> 01:57:45.760]  your calls only two minutes away, this is the most censored broadcast in the world for
[01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:46.760]  a reason.
[01:57:46.760 --> 01:57:51.680]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[01:57:51.680 --> 01:57:56.400]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[01:57:56.400 --> 01:57:57.920]  to detoxify the body.
[01:57:57.920 --> 01:58:02.800]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:58:02.800 --> 01:58:08.000]  It's made in the USA, it's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:12.960]  associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the infowar, it is a classical 360
[01:58:12.960 --> 01:58:13.960]  win.
[01:58:13.960 --> 01:58:17.840]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:22.480]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:23.480]  get.
[01:58:23.480 --> 01:58:26.720]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this
[01:58:26.720 --> 01:58:31.760]  country and the world that Patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:37.000]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.720]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:58:39.720 --> 01:58:43.000]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:49.240]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield and infowarslife.com.
[01:58:49.240 --> 01:58:52.480]  Just like our information is game changing, our products are game changing and Survival
[01:58:52.480 --> 01:58:57.120]  Shield X2 is the pure iodine, no one else has this from deep earth crystals between
[01:58:57.120 --> 01:59:02.520]  7 and 12,000 feet, it's very hard for me to get, it's the good halogen but instead they
[01:59:02.520 --> 01:59:07.800]  hammer you with the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine that literally fog you,
[01:59:07.800 --> 01:59:10.760]  fill out all your cells, your thyroid, you name it.
[01:59:10.760 --> 01:59:16.080]  Myotrysilinium goes with it like a horse of carriage, selenium is an electrochemical,
[01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:22.360]  it's needed as well in all activity in the body, particularly neurons, so these go in
[01:59:22.360 --> 01:59:23.360]  incredibly well together.
[01:59:23.360 --> 01:59:27.760]  We have a combo of those, just experience it for yourself, why do you think they fear
[01:59:27.760 --> 01:59:28.760]  me so much?
[01:59:28.760 --> 01:59:34.240]  Very simple stuff, filter your water, yeah I find myself some water filters, best out
[01:59:34.240 --> 01:59:35.240]  there for the price.
[01:59:35.240 --> 01:59:39.520]  When I say it's the last run, I think it'll be 6 months a year until we get more, I hope
[01:59:39.520 --> 01:59:43.840]  we get more, this is the last run it looks like, Survival Shield X2, infowarslife.com
[01:59:43.840 --> 01:59:54.120]  or AAA-253-3139, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:43:26.780 --> 02:00:28.880]  I'm gonna go to your phone calls, and I'm gonna as quickly as I can get to
[02:00:28.880 --> 02:00:32.360]  the latest developments with Communist China, and look I know everybody's like we know China's
[02:00:32.360 --> 02:00:36.280]  running things, we know the globalist uses it as a place they can go and break all the
[02:00:36.280 --> 02:00:41.000]  laws internationally and do what they want, but Congress is only realizing this, the public's
[02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:46.080]  only realizing it, and I'm telling you, you expose that China is puppeteering the Democratic
[02:00:46.080 --> 02:00:51.920]  Party and the globalist operations, people at a nationalist level will line up against
[02:00:51.920 --> 02:00:56.320]  it, plus they're gonna get all the prosperity, because China has set it up to totally screw
[02:00:56.320 --> 02:01:03.600]  us economically, so we are basically at the enemy and target right now, I mean we can
[02:01:03.600 --> 02:01:07.400]  blow them back to hell.
[02:01:07.400 --> 02:01:11.800]  We can defeat the Chai comms, free the Chinese people, but the globalists have wanted an
[02:01:11.800 --> 02:01:15.680]  anti-human future, they've been funding the worst Muslim groups, they've been funding
[02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:19.120]  the worst Communist groups, that's what's in the WikiLeaks, that's what the globalists
[02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:25.240]  do, they want a worldwide system of destabilization, and Trump's saying, no, we're gonna start
[02:01:25.240 --> 02:01:32.040]  straight shooting, that's what America used to be, and people are sick of globalism,
[02:01:32.040 --> 02:01:37.520]  they're sick of divide and conquer, and they're ready.
[02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:42.160]  There isn't just evil in the universe, folks, and that's why they hate Trump so much, because
[02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:43.160]  he's real.
[02:01:43.160 --> 02:01:52.680]  People are like, my God, you're riding on Trump's jock, no I'm not, this is everything
[02:01:52.680 --> 02:01:58.840]  we wanted, we built Trump, we made Trump, we built the launch pad, comprende, I know
[02:01:58.840 --> 02:02:03.560]  the general audience gets that, but let's be aggressive about our support of Trump.
[02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:08.040]  They're trying to break our will, and I kind of like him, but he's not perfect, no.
[02:02:08.040 --> 02:02:11.240]  People come up to me, distant family, and I kind of make jokes about Trump, and I get
[02:02:11.240 --> 02:02:17.000]  in their face, man, I say what, you like China running things, you like the anti-free speech
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:21.320]  crap out of the Democrats, you don't like the economy coming back, then fine, just keep
[02:02:21.320 --> 02:02:25.440]  it to yourself then, I don't give a damn what you'd say to me when you just regard
[02:02:25.440 --> 02:02:30.560]  a bunch of BS, you understand?
[02:02:30.560 --> 02:02:34.840]  I don't care if you think I'm wrong, so don't try to feed your ego trying to make me feel
[02:02:34.840 --> 02:02:44.120]  stupid when you're a frickin moron, I'm serious, that's where I stand, with all of this.
[02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:51.720]  I'm going to go to your calls, you know, we have a contest, we're running, I just sit
[02:02:51.720 --> 02:02:55.520]  down today, it's only running through next Monday, I've decided when I do contests now,
[02:02:55.520 --> 02:02:58.280]  they're going to be like five, six days, and that's it.
[02:02:58.280 --> 02:03:06.560]  It could be video, it could be an image, it could be anything visual, an MPC meme contest,
[02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:10.280]  and the rules are, it's at my discretion because I have a bunch of rules and try to track it
[02:03:10.280 --> 02:03:13.480]  all and where it came from, I just need you to show me the providence, who you are, where
[02:03:13.480 --> 02:03:18.160]  it came from, show it's first posting, post it on the web somewhere, so that I can see
[02:03:18.160 --> 02:03:22.480]  it and verify it's who you are so you get the money, plus it's just fun to fight back,
[02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:23.480]  isn't it?
[02:03:23.480 --> 02:03:27.080]  It's good to celebrate it too with a symbol of energy, money, so you can have some fun,
[02:03:27.080 --> 02:03:35.280]  maybe make more memes, $10,000, and I'll say Tuesday so I get more time, but it will be
[02:03:35.280 --> 02:03:43.400]  announced Tuesday on my show, and they're pouring in at npcandmfullwars.com, it could
[02:03:43.400 --> 02:03:51.320]  be a video, it could be an image, whatever you do, make it, send it in, and we're going
[02:03:51.320 --> 02:03:56.400]  to take the best ones and post them to npcandmfullwars.com, and newswars.com, and play them on air,
[02:03:56.400 --> 02:03:59.560]  and it's going to be fun because it scares them, because it shows how they're a bunch

[02:06:40.440 --> 02:06:47.920]  DNA and me showed that I'm actually 4.2% Cherokee Indian, turns out I'm not totally white, I'm
[02:06:47.920 --> 02:06:53.640]  also part northern Asian and even some Kurdish, I'm a victim of oppression, I used to get
[02:06:53.640 --> 02:06:59.240]  in trouble for always using the N word, but with DNA and me I found out that I'm 2.1%
[02:06:59.240 --> 02:07:06.120]  black, morning Steve, stop, the test is easy, simply swab the inside of your mouth and send
[02:07:06.120 --> 02:07:12.440]  it into our labs, people made fun of me for being French, DNA and me showed I was 8% Navajo,
[02:07:12.440 --> 02:07:18.760]  nobody's making fun of me now or my people who are victims, I'm 13% victim, I'm 21%

[02:07:30.880 --> 02:07:58.960]  you know usually the son of some great legend is not as good as the father, Shudder Jennings
[02:07:58.960 --> 02:08:05.440]  is an amazing artist, he's a wide repertoire of everything from classic outlaw country
[02:08:05.440 --> 02:08:11.040]  to this smooth stuff we're listening to right now, Summer of Rage, about like 5 years ago
[02:08:11.040 --> 02:08:16.320]  from here to here on air, and boy they pressured him to throw me into the buzz and say hey
[02:08:16.320 --> 02:08:19.760]  somebody says he loves me more than ever, we need to get Shudder back on, he gets me
[02:08:19.760 --> 02:08:25.840]  an outlaw, he gets me an Americana, he gets it, alright in the spirit going to your calls,
[02:08:25.840 --> 02:08:29.020]  I will get in the last segment of the show today but I will do it to the incredible new
[02:08:29.020 --> 02:08:33.760]  developments with Google and Communist China and going from lying to Congress just 3 weeks
[02:08:33.760 --> 02:08:39.920]  ago to saying okay we're spying, we're censoring, we're doing it all and it's a wonderful thing,
[02:08:39.920 --> 02:08:45.520]  it's just flabbergasting, but then they separately still go to Congress and say nothing's going
[02:08:45.520 --> 02:08:51.960]  on, in the New York Times, banned MPC memes, banned anyone criticizing anybody, only liberals
[02:08:51.960 --> 02:08:58.280]  can talk, it's so authoritarian and then they turn around at the same time and say it's
[02:08:58.280 --> 02:09:05.280]  not happening to Congress, it's outrageous ladies and gentlemen, you're like well it's
[02:09:05.280 --> 02:09:12.320]  their website, well they defame you calling you a Nazi when they take your stuff down,
[02:09:12.320 --> 02:09:15.920]  they lie about you in the process and now they're saying you can't go to college even
[02:09:15.920 --> 02:09:19.960]  if it's a public college you'd have your own speech, so see no, no this is everywhere,
[02:09:19.960 --> 02:09:25.880]  these are authoritarians and they've taken our acquiescence to it as a big giant green
[02:09:25.880 --> 02:09:31.160]  light to accept it, so this is the New York Times on screen of your TV viewer, bragging
[02:09:31.160 --> 02:09:38.160]  that Twitter has banned hundreds of right-wing accounts for posting as soulless, non-playable
[02:09:38.160 --> 02:09:44.480]  liberal activist, how dare you point out the left is monolithic, hateful and antifreece
[02:09:44.480 --> 02:09:48.840]  speech, how dare you say they're programmed and put out insane chants, in fact I found
[02:09:48.840 --> 02:09:54.960]  the videos earlier, the crew did, because I did that whole breakdown first hour about
[02:09:54.960 --> 02:09:59.760]  the brainwashing of the MPC system and why archetypally it threatens the left so much,
[02:09:59.760 --> 02:10:06.160]  we don't know what MPC is, just go to infowords.com, but we didn't play the most powerful ones
[02:10:06.160 --> 02:10:11.400]  that totally prove it, where it's video after video during the cabinet hearings with the
[02:10:11.400 --> 02:10:17.120]  left programming groups of people, I will go forth and I will block the hallways and
[02:10:17.120 --> 02:10:20.640]  I will go to this person and I will say this, I will go forth and I will block the hallways
[02:10:20.640 --> 02:10:29.680]  and I will, I mean it is, the stuff you see out of like, wild, wild country or heaven's
[02:10:29.680 --> 02:10:41.160]  gate, I mean this is, beam me up Scotty, hail bop, drink the suicide potion, and it's getting
[02:10:41.160 --> 02:10:49.280]  worse and worse and worse and worse, okay Chris, comedic, genius, Chris, Sandra, Chase,
[02:10:49.280 --> 02:10:55.760]  Kim, Tommy, Mario, Matt, Carlos, Joseph, Jay, we're going to all of you today, I'm
[02:10:55.760 --> 02:11:03.640]  going to get to at least these 15 calls over there, they're on board there, who should
[02:11:03.640 --> 02:11:12.920]  we talk to first, let's go ahead and talk to Sandra in the great state of Texas, Sandra
[02:11:12.920 --> 02:11:18.160]  welcome to the airwaves, thanks for holding, hi Alex, this is my first time to call, so
[02:11:18.160 --> 02:11:24.040]  I appreciate you taking, I appreciate you calling, thank you, sure, hey I've got my
[02:11:24.040 --> 02:11:28.160]  first, I wanted to hit on three things with you real quick, the first one is, I just want
[02:11:28.160 --> 02:11:32.880]  to see if you think that Hillary will ever go to prison, do you think that Donald Trump
[02:11:32.880 --> 02:11:34.400]  will work on that?
[02:11:34.400 --> 02:11:40.120]  She needs to, in fact I'm glad you brought this up, Mueller has leaked to Fox News The
[02:11:40.120 --> 02:11:43.680]  New York Times that he's going to end the investigation a week after the election and
[02:11:43.680 --> 02:11:49.000]  that Russia meddling was not found by Trump and even all the fake obstruction stuff and
[02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:53.720]  they're going to basically end it at that, I don't know if that's true but that's what
[02:11:53.720 --> 02:11:58.120]  Rosenstein told Trump two weeks ago, remember when I said it looks like Rosenstein's rolled
[02:11:58.120 --> 02:12:02.680]  over, unless they're playing possum, but we know there's no Russia gate there, they tried
[02:12:02.680 --> 02:12:06.760]  to even set me up and I'm not liberty to get into it but it was unbelievable, so, so,
[02:12:06.760 --> 02:12:10.920]  oh yeah, oh yeah, I was approached with, Russians want to give you money, I did contact the
[02:12:10.920 --> 02:12:15.680]  FBI just to cover my butt, but this is the stuff that's going on and it was literally
[02:12:15.680 --> 02:12:22.600]  the group connected to Fusion GPS, the whole, it was the CIA, the CIA, so the Democrat run
[02:12:22.600 --> 02:12:28.880]  CIA literally, officially approached me and anyways, I'm not going to get into that, lawyers
[02:12:28.880 --> 02:12:32.040]  say don't get into it and it was the folks even involved even knew what they were doing
[02:12:32.040 --> 02:12:38.360]  but the point is, that's the type of things that happen in this country, so, your question
[02:12:38.360 --> 02:12:43.200]  was, because Susan and I got off listening to myself talk about will Hillary ever go
[02:12:43.200 --> 02:12:51.160]  to prison, if they roll over and go into abstention and, you know, maroon her somewhere in the
[02:12:51.160 --> 02:12:55.760]  Phantom Zone, if she would just leave, that would be good because if we fight her to the
[02:12:55.760 --> 02:12:59.520]  political death, she may keep trying to sabotage the country, but I don't think she'll take
[02:12:59.520 --> 02:13:02.760]  that high road, I don't think she'll ever go away and I think Trump's pledge, he's followed
[02:13:02.760 --> 02:13:06.760]  through on all his pledges, so far he's been able to execute and one of the ones he hasn't
[02:13:06.760 --> 02:13:10.760]  gotten done yet is Hillary for prison and that entire deep state group that sold out
[02:13:10.760 --> 02:13:16.560]  the communist China and others deserve to be given the punishment for high treason, what
[02:13:16.560 --> 02:13:17.560]  do you think?
[02:13:17.560 --> 02:13:25.640]  Well, I mean, it's something I think about on a daily basis and I tuned in on your show
[02:13:25.640 --> 02:13:32.760]  like starting in 2016 and I just, I thought about it so much and it just, she insults
[02:13:32.760 --> 02:13:39.280]  my intelligence on a daily basis and it just, it draws me nuts that she's out there saying
[02:13:39.280 --> 02:13:44.320]  the things that she does and getting away with it, it really bothers me.
[02:13:44.320 --> 02:13:49.520]  No, I agree and that sends a message of arrogance, but Trump at the next level, look at Strach
[02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:53.720]  acting like he's auditioning to play the wicked witch of the East when he's in there in front
[02:13:53.720 --> 02:14:00.000]  of Congress making little weird homoerotic demon faces and then Hillary falling down
[02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:04.240]  everywhere and then wrecking her ambulance in New York that she drives around in an ambulance
[02:14:04.240 --> 02:14:09.680]  so the Batmobile, it's a black ambulance with a wheelchair in it, so just archetypally,
[02:14:09.680 --> 02:14:13.440]  she's already singing into the mud, but I agree, her whole criminal network needs to
[02:14:13.440 --> 02:14:14.440]  be prosecuted.
[02:14:14.440 --> 02:14:19.800]  Yes, and it does feel like a criminal network, it really does, it feels like they're the
[02:14:19.800 --> 02:14:23.920]  mafia and I mean, I think about that a lot.
[02:14:23.920 --> 02:14:27.960]  This feels like there's something very evil going on in the world.
[02:14:27.960 --> 02:14:31.600]  Well, Sandra, what you're saying is, and I forget who said it, justice be done may the
[02:14:31.600 --> 02:14:36.720]  heavens fall and I also get like Napoleon gives up, send him to this island, then he
[02:14:36.720 --> 02:14:39.640]  snuck off the island and started another war and then they're sitting back to another
[02:14:39.640 --> 02:14:45.440]  island, but it's the same thing over and over again, powerful evil people, you want
[02:14:45.440 --> 02:14:48.840]  to just have them go away, but the Romans were smart, they would make people go into
[02:14:48.840 --> 02:14:52.320]  a small province and be a governor, if they got in trouble or did something, they would
[02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:55.160]  just send them away because then they wouldn't fight to the death.
[02:14:55.160 --> 02:14:59.120]  They didn't give Caesar that chance, so he did fight to the death and of course, one
[02:14:59.120 --> 02:15:04.600]  for a while, but it's a complex issue and I don't think Hillary Clinton's long for
[02:15:04.600 --> 02:15:05.600]  this world.
[02:15:05.600 --> 02:15:10.800]  I mean, she looks like a reanimated corpse dragging along, I'd give her, I think Hillary
[02:15:10.800 --> 02:15:15.080]  Clinton's got maximum with even top doctors two, three years.
[02:15:15.080 --> 02:15:23.280]  Well, I guess I hope he does get her in prison, but I wanted to tell you, I have an idea also
[02:15:23.280 --> 02:15:26.880]  that's off the topic, I told you I had three things real quick.
[02:15:26.880 --> 02:15:32.040]  The other is I had an idea for a platform for you because you got knocked off of Twitter
[02:15:32.040 --> 02:15:38.160]  and this might sound stupid, but instead of calling it info wars, make it like your little
[02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:45.000]  icon would be the lion head and you'd be called info wars and I don't know how to build
[02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:46.000]  a platform.
[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:49.640]  If I could, I would work on it, but I just, that is a super good idea.
[02:15:49.640 --> 02:15:51.480]  We're trying to develop a lot of stuff like that.
[02:15:51.480 --> 02:15:52.480]  So God bless you.
[02:15:52.480 --> 02:15:53.480]  Thank you, Sandra.

[02:17:26.440 --> 02:17:30.360]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:17:30.360 --> 02:17:31.920]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:17:31.920 --> 02:17:34.880]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.

[02:20:48.320 --> 02:20:53.640]  How many more, how many more, how many more colleges, how many more classrooms, how many
[02:20:53.640 --> 02:20:59.280]  more movie theaters, how many more houses of faith, how many more shopping malls, how
[02:20:59.280 --> 02:21:07.280]  many more street corners, how many more, how many more, enough, enough, enough, demand
[02:21:07.280 --> 02:21:08.280]  a plan.
[02:21:08.280 --> 02:21:16.480]  Right now, as a mom, as a dad, as a friend, as a husband, as a wife, as an American, as
[02:21:16.480 --> 02:21:23.760]  an American, as an American, as a human being, for the children of Sandy Hook.
[02:21:23.760 --> 02:21:24.760]  Demand a plan.
[02:21:24.760 --> 02:21:26.760]  No more lists of names.
[02:21:26.760 --> 02:21:28.480]  It's not too soon.
[02:21:28.480 --> 02:21:29.480]  It's too late.
[02:21:29.480 --> 02:21:31.120]  Now is the time.
[02:21:31.120 --> 02:21:34.080]  Before we all know someone who loves someone on that list.
[02:21:34.080 --> 02:21:35.080]  No more lists.
[02:21:35.080 --> 02:21:39.280]  No more who they might have been, no more.
[02:21:39.280 --> 02:21:42.560]  So think about that.
[02:21:42.560 --> 02:21:45.720]  The Arabs bring that Hillary and others funded, killed hundreds of thousands of innocent
[02:21:45.720 --> 02:21:46.720]  people.
[02:21:46.720 --> 02:21:49.240]  They fund communist China that's killed tens of millions of their own people recently.
[02:21:49.240 --> 02:21:55.480]  And they say no more lists of people shot by crazy people with guns, as if it's all
[02:21:55.480 --> 02:22:00.240]  of our fault that bad people get guns, like bad people get cars, or all the Islamic attacks
[02:22:00.240 --> 02:22:02.240]  using vehicles and knives to kill people.
[02:22:02.240 --> 02:22:03.240]  It's just crazy.
[02:22:03.240 --> 02:22:06.240]  All right, let's go back to your phone calls, take a lot of them here today.
[02:22:06.240 --> 02:22:11.080]  Carlos in Canada, I see you want to talk about Fed said the greatest threat is the Federal
[02:22:11.080 --> 02:22:15.960]  Reserve, which is the private run for profit Federal Reserve that told PBS years ago, former
[02:22:15.960 --> 02:22:17.960]  head of it.
[02:22:17.960 --> 02:22:19.760]  Greenspan said we're above the law.
[02:22:19.760 --> 02:22:21.800]  Well, nobody's above the law.
[02:22:21.800 --> 02:22:25.400]  Federal Reserve, Trump says is my greatest threat to the economy.
[02:22:25.400 --> 02:22:32.120]  My threat is the Fed, because the Fed is raising rates too fast.
[02:22:32.120 --> 02:22:36.160]  And it's independent, so I don't speak to him, but I'm not happy with what he's doing
[02:22:36.160 --> 02:22:41.280]  because it's going too fast because you looked at the last inflation numbers are very low.
[02:22:41.280 --> 02:22:46.760]  And so it's not federal, like Federal Express or Federal Ammunition or Federal Exterminators
[02:22:46.760 --> 02:22:49.560]  or Federal Pizza, there is such a thing.
[02:22:49.560 --> 02:22:51.400]  The other stuff's real fed stuff.
[02:22:51.400 --> 02:22:52.400]  It's not fed.
[02:22:52.400 --> 02:22:57.600]  And it was set up in 1913, it's been around over 100 years, 103 years, 104 years now, hard
[02:22:57.600 --> 02:23:01.560]  to believe, 105 years time flies.
[02:23:01.560 --> 02:23:05.400]  And it's over our country, they didn't raise rates under Obama, now they've raised them
[02:23:05.400 --> 02:23:09.040]  what seven times on Trump has tried to dampen the economy.
[02:23:09.040 --> 02:23:10.040]  That's meddling.
[02:23:10.040 --> 02:23:12.560]  Carlos, what do you say is going on?
[02:23:12.560 --> 02:23:18.680]  I think that, thank you, Alex, but I think this is the October surprise that we, well,
[02:23:18.680 --> 02:23:24.840]  we discussed in the past, the Federal Reserve, I believe, has outlived this usefulness as
[02:23:24.840 --> 02:23:30.360]  far as the United States of America is concerned, if there were any usefulness to the Federal
[02:23:30.360 --> 02:23:33.720]  Reserve, let me explain why.
[02:23:33.720 --> 02:23:39.680]  When the Federal Reserve prints money out of thin air and gives it out to various banks
[02:23:39.680 --> 02:23:46.560]  to create credit, the banks naturally lend to those that have the greatest credit so
[02:23:46.560 --> 02:23:48.360]  that it creates a vicious circle.
[02:23:48.360 --> 02:23:50.680]  Well, let's be clear.
[02:23:50.680 --> 02:23:51.680]  Let's be clear.
[02:23:51.680 --> 02:23:56.040]  The big banks engineered collapses and things to get it pushed through, then, especially
[02:23:56.040 --> 02:24:01.240]  under Obama, they only gave the trillions of dollars to themselves, to the private subsidiaries
[02:24:01.240 --> 02:24:04.520]  that had their own members on the board of the Federal Reserve, then they actually cut
[02:24:04.520 --> 02:24:09.160]  lending but then gave the credit to themselves at 0% to buy everything up.
[02:24:09.160 --> 02:24:12.800]  They've been using it as a weapon against us and Trump knows that.
[02:24:12.800 --> 02:24:13.800]  Precisely.
[02:24:13.800 --> 02:24:16.120]  But let me explain.
[02:24:16.120 --> 02:24:22.760]  The fact is that the printing of money out of thin air through the banking system creates
[02:24:22.760 --> 02:24:23.760]  oligarchies.
[02:24:23.760 --> 02:24:27.360]  It creates individuals that can amass gazillions of dollars.
[02:24:27.360 --> 02:24:28.360]  Yes.
[02:24:28.360 --> 02:24:32.560]  The select anointed groups, the select anointed groups, they get all the money and nobody
[02:24:32.560 --> 02:24:33.560]  else does.
[02:24:33.560 --> 02:24:34.560]  Right.
[02:24:34.560 --> 02:24:39.680]  And then what happens is that the individual worker, the employee, the everyday American
[02:24:39.680 --> 02:24:45.160]  is subject to the will of very powerful corporate structures.
[02:24:45.160 --> 02:24:50.040]  Now these corporate structures, they're treated like individuals, however, they don't go to
[02:24:50.040 --> 02:24:55.320]  jail like ordinary people, so that you've got a situation where a privilege of being
[02:24:55.320 --> 02:24:57.800]  a corporation is that you have a charter.
[02:24:57.800 --> 02:25:05.240]  When have you and I seen a company or a pharmaceutical company that defrauds people, that defraud-
[02:25:05.240 --> 02:25:06.240]  No, I understand.
[02:25:06.240 --> 02:25:09.440]  And just like vaccine companies, it has liability protection, so does the Federal Reserve.
[02:25:09.440 --> 02:25:11.440]  And it's a criminal group.
[02:25:11.440 --> 02:25:12.680]  Most of the stockholders are foreign.
[02:25:12.680 --> 02:25:14.680]  There's never been an audit, but we know what it's founding.
[02:25:14.680 --> 02:25:16.840]  It was like 80% European-owned.
[02:25:16.840 --> 02:25:17.840]  It is the enemy.
[02:25:17.840 --> 02:25:18.840]  It is globalism.
[02:25:18.840 --> 02:25:22.920]  It's Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, that literally is investing everything in China.
[02:25:22.920 --> 02:25:24.360]  They're the ones that set us up.
[02:25:24.360 --> 02:25:26.320]  We have to get rid of the Federal Reserve.
[02:25:26.320 --> 02:25:30.520]  Well, President Trump must, after the-
[02:25:30.520 --> 02:25:31.880]  He needs to nationalize it.
[02:25:31.880 --> 02:25:32.880]  It's called federal.
[02:25:32.880 --> 02:25:35.640]  Everybody's like, well, I thought it was already national.
[02:25:35.640 --> 02:25:36.640]  Nationalize it.
[02:25:36.640 --> 02:25:41.440]  Have his chief economist over there, Cudlow, and just announce it's nationalized and sign
[02:25:41.440 --> 02:25:42.440]  an executive order.
[02:25:42.440 --> 02:25:44.960]  They don't have to do that, Alex.
[02:25:44.960 --> 02:25:49.920]  All he has to do is say the United States no longer requires the services of this corporation
[02:25:49.920 --> 02:25:52.720]  and he will use its Treasury, the Treasury, which-
[02:25:52.720 --> 02:25:53.720]  Yeah, you're right.
[02:25:53.720 --> 02:25:57.400]  The Treasury can take over the exact same functions and even leave it like it is.
[02:25:57.400 --> 02:25:58.400]  Thank you.
[02:25:58.400 --> 02:26:03.600]  No more borrowing from the Federal Reserve, audit the Federal Reserve, and all loans made
[02:26:03.600 --> 02:26:08.040]  out of money printed out of thin air should be paid back with money printed out of thin
[02:26:08.040 --> 02:26:09.040]  air, not the work of-
[02:26:09.040 --> 02:26:12.280]  Which is what the globalists already do, then they only hand us the debt.
[02:26:12.280 --> 02:26:15.800]  They make money on the upside and the downside and what you're saying is what top economists
[02:26:15.800 --> 02:26:16.800]  have said here.
[02:26:16.800 --> 02:26:20.960]  So, Trump to announce plan to nationalize the Federal Reserve?
[02:26:20.960 --> 02:26:21.960]  Question mark?
[02:26:21.960 --> 02:26:22.960]  That's the answer.
[02:26:22.960 --> 02:26:23.960]  God bless you, Carlos.
[02:26:23.960 --> 02:26:24.960]  Great points.
[02:26:24.960 --> 02:26:26.960]  So, let's put this out on the Internet as a video.
[02:26:26.960 --> 02:26:28.280]  This is a segment.
[02:26:28.280 --> 02:26:32.160]  Trump to announce plan to nationalize the Federal Reserve?
[02:26:32.160 --> 02:26:33.160]  Question mark?
[02:26:33.160 --> 02:26:34.400]  Great points, Carlos.
[02:26:34.400 --> 02:26:38.760]  Okay, let's go ahead and take a call here.
[02:26:38.760 --> 02:26:42.960]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chase in California, Chase, you're on the here.
[02:26:42.960 --> 02:26:47.520]  Hey, thanks so much for taking my call, Alex, and thank you for everything you do for our
[02:26:47.520 --> 02:26:48.520]  country.
[02:26:48.520 --> 02:26:54.360]  Now, speaking of your contest, you inspired me and I tried your reporter contest and
[02:26:54.360 --> 02:26:57.400]  ever since I've been producing reports every day.
[02:26:57.400 --> 02:27:02.520]  And one of the things I've been seeing a trend of is a huge buildup of militarism.
[02:27:02.520 --> 02:27:07.480]  Now we've seen our own country spend over $300 billion recently on our military.
[02:27:07.480 --> 02:27:12.040]  We've seen Saudi Arabia buy $250 billion from our country.
[02:27:12.040 --> 02:27:17.000]  We've seen an arms deal from India where they're buying $100 billion from Russia.
[02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:21.280]  And this is all showing signs because of the threat of China.
[02:27:21.280 --> 02:27:25.200]  They are playing the game of risk and they're the only ones doing it.
[02:27:25.200 --> 02:27:28.920]  They're in the EU making deals trying to sabotage our economy.
[02:27:28.920 --> 02:27:29.920]  They're in...
[02:27:29.920 --> 02:27:30.920]  No, you're right.
[02:27:30.920 --> 02:27:34.240]  The entire buildup is China because they're selling weapons to everybody and China is
[02:27:34.240 --> 02:27:35.240]  economically taking over.
[02:27:35.240 --> 02:27:36.440]  They're really flexing their muscles.
[02:27:36.440 --> 02:27:41.320]  Hell, I've got articles today without even looking from a Hollywood reporter, Wall Street
[02:27:41.320 --> 02:27:47.080]  Journal, where China is muscling what movies we can put out, what US mergers we can have,
[02:27:47.080 --> 02:27:51.880]  Trump, because he's a free marketer and conservatives don't flex our muscles in the economy in a
[02:27:51.880 --> 02:27:55.920]  command and control, which is great, but don't let them command and control.
[02:27:55.920 --> 02:28:00.280]  If we stop China and others from command and controlling our economy or we stop Silicon
[02:28:00.280 --> 02:28:04.960]  Valley from letting China intimidate them into censoring, that's not command and control.
[02:28:04.960 --> 02:28:09.240]  It's stopping command and control and the vacuum we have allowed has allowed instead
[02:28:09.240 --> 02:28:13.880]  of the federal government running things and then saying, we run things, you run it, America.
[02:28:13.880 --> 02:28:17.480]  And turning loose, we have allowed in the vacuum the chai comms to come in here and
[02:28:17.480 --> 02:28:20.600]  the EU and I'm done with it.
[02:28:20.600 --> 02:28:21.600]  I am too.
[02:28:21.600 --> 02:28:25.760]  You know, we are at a hot war with China and people don't realize it.
[02:28:25.760 --> 02:28:27.440]  They have murdered our spies.
[02:28:27.440 --> 02:28:29.480]  Let's talk about it when we come back.
[02:28:29.480 --> 02:28:32.240]  Yeah, no, they're just murdering people because why not?
[02:28:32.240 --> 02:28:33.760]  They see America as weak.
[02:28:33.760 --> 02:28:39.680]  But something happened like with the Japanese, they gave them a lot of rope and that's a
[02:28:39.680 --> 02:28:45.240]  British thing and we're kind of like the British Empire now, so a lot of this is and I don't
[02:28:45.240 --> 02:28:46.240]  want this to happen.
[02:28:46.240 --> 02:28:47.240]  It's a lot of us playing possum.
[02:28:47.240 --> 02:28:51.880]  I think at the end of the day, the chai comms are going to get destroyed.
[02:28:51.880 --> 02:28:56.640]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:28:56.640 --> 02:29:00.560]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:29:00.560 --> 02:29:02.080]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:29:02.080 --> 02:29:05.080]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:29:05.080 --> 02:29:08.360]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[02:29:08.360 --> 02:29:10.600]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[02:30:56.240 --> 02:31:01.160]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[02:31:01.160 --> 02:31:05.600]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able to get all
[02:31:05.600 --> 02:31:10.680]  the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.

[02:32:00.240 --> 02:32:05.200]  Years ago, Infowars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal
[02:32:05.200 --> 02:32:06.200]  yeast.
[02:32:06.200 --> 02:32:09.760]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew
[02:32:09.760 --> 02:32:13.720]  we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[02:32:13.720 --> 02:32:18.840]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula, a unique natural formula designed
[02:32:18.840 --> 02:32:22.400]  to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.

[02:32:43.120 --> 02:32:46.120]  of time as powerful microbalancing properties.
[02:32:46.120 --> 02:32:50.920]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved MycoZX Plus today at InfowarsLife.com.
[02:32:50.920 --> 02:33:17.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:17.760 --> 02:33:42.000]  All I can say to the globalist is, get some, get some, get some, because you're getting
[02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.480]  it, and you're getting it good, and we're winning all over the world.
[02:33:44.480 --> 02:33:49.800]  To be painful for those of us at the tip of the spear, but what's more painful is living
[02:33:49.800 --> 02:33:51.960]  on our knees as slaves.
[02:33:51.960 --> 02:33:57.760]  Here's the video from more than 10 years ago, about 11 years ago, the Lair News Hour, used
[02:33:57.760 --> 02:34:04.960]  to be the McNeill Lair News Hour, on PBS, Rockefeller Broadcasting, with the recently
[02:34:04.960 --> 02:34:09.840]  at the time departed head of the Private Run for Profit Fellow Reserve, saying it's
[02:34:09.840 --> 02:34:12.120]  above the law, separate from all three branches.
[02:34:12.120 --> 02:34:16.160]  Now, the other three branches of government watch and confirm each other and keep them
[02:34:16.160 --> 02:34:22.000]  in the balance, but the Fed established in 1913, says it is an equal, separate branch.
[02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:27.280]  Well, if the president was totally separate, and he didn't have impeachment hanging over
[02:34:27.280 --> 02:34:32.760]  his head, he would be a dictator, unless he just stepped down, and it'd be the same thing
[02:34:32.760 --> 02:34:34.920]  for judges or members of Congress.
[02:34:34.920 --> 02:34:45.200]  But what a flagrant, arrogant statement this is, and somehow they've convinced Trump
[02:34:45.200 --> 02:34:49.080]  that the Federal Reserve is separate so that he has no power over it.
[02:34:49.080 --> 02:34:54.320]  He could nationalize it in 10 seconds flat under the Constitution Bill of Rights.
[02:34:54.320 --> 02:34:56.960]  He could say, you're a corporation, you're no longer needed.
[02:34:56.960 --> 02:35:01.200]  We take it under advisement, that the Federal Reserve Act, but that doesn't matter.
[02:35:01.200 --> 02:35:05.200]  Under a national emergency, the Treasury now will oversee all this, and I will make the
[02:35:05.200 --> 02:35:06.200]  decisions.
[02:35:06.200 --> 02:35:10.880]  If Federal Reserve heads seek to stay in their positions at the 12 Federal Reserve banks,
[02:35:10.880 --> 02:35:11.880]  you can do that.
[02:35:11.880 --> 02:35:14.960]  And by the way, most of them don't even like the New York Fed that actually runs it and
[02:35:14.960 --> 02:35:17.840]  has a private corporation that owns it that's super secret.
[02:35:17.840 --> 02:35:22.880]  Most of Fed heads in Dallas and Kansas City and other areas in Atlanta are actually like
[02:35:22.880 --> 02:35:24.880]  Trump patriots.
[02:35:24.880 --> 02:35:28.200]  So it's not the banking system itself that's bad.
[02:35:28.200 --> 02:35:33.640]  It's the foreign shareholders of the Federal Reserve, and we knew it was 80% foreign when
[02:35:33.640 --> 02:35:35.120]  it got set up.
[02:35:35.120 --> 02:35:36.120]  We don't know now.
[02:35:36.120 --> 02:35:37.120]  It's so secret.
[02:35:37.120 --> 02:35:38.120]  So we never had it on it.
[02:35:38.120 --> 02:35:39.120]  We pushed for that.
[02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:42.120]  But here is good old Alan Greenspan.
[02:35:42.120 --> 02:35:48.040]  Well, first of all, the Federal Reserve is an independent agency, and that means basically
[02:35:48.040 --> 02:35:58.360]  that there is no other agency of government which can overrule actions that we take.
[02:35:58.360 --> 02:36:05.960]  So long as that is in place and there is no evidence that the administration or the Congress
[02:36:05.960 --> 02:36:11.480]  or anybody else is requesting that we do things other than what we think is the appropriate
[02:36:11.480 --> 02:36:20.200]  thing, then what the relationships are don't frankly matter.
[02:36:20.200 --> 02:36:22.160]  No one can regulate us.
[02:36:22.160 --> 02:36:23.160]  No one.
[02:36:23.160 --> 02:36:24.160]  We're just out here.
[02:36:24.160 --> 02:36:25.160]  We just run everything.
[02:36:25.160 --> 02:36:28.560]  Well, you white shoe boys or something else, aren't you?
[02:36:28.560 --> 02:36:34.280]  It's time for Trump to nationalize the Federal Reserve because it is our financial system.
[02:36:34.280 --> 02:36:42.040]  It is tied into all the private banks, and I think it needs to be nationalized postage.
[02:36:42.040 --> 02:36:43.200]  Do it.
[02:36:43.200 --> 02:36:44.200]  Take the gloves off.
[02:36:44.200 --> 02:36:47.440]  Stop letting these con artists push us like this.
[02:36:47.440 --> 02:36:48.440]  All right.
[02:36:48.440 --> 02:36:54.200]  Chase, you were getting into Communist China saying, you know, hot water.
[02:36:54.200 --> 02:36:58.680]  Yeah, for people that don't know, five years ago, we started getting all the staff at US
[02:36:58.680 --> 02:37:03.160]  Embassy sick, brain damage, lower IQs, nosebleeds, some of them.
[02:37:03.160 --> 02:37:08.560]  A few people died of heart attacks, and they said it's sound waves, and I said, no, it's
[02:37:08.560 --> 02:37:09.560]  microwaves.
[02:37:09.560 --> 02:37:13.240]  And of course, now they admit even the Washington Post, it's microwaves.
[02:37:13.240 --> 02:37:16.600]  Same thing at our embassy in Havana, Cuba.
[02:37:16.600 --> 02:37:20.400]  And China is just super belligerent.
[02:37:20.400 --> 02:37:22.280]  And there's a billion, 300 plus million.
[02:37:22.280 --> 02:37:26.000]  They kill whoever they want in their own country, and they've got all the rare earth minerals
[02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:27.840]  they've got at more than half the trade in the world.
[02:37:27.840 --> 02:37:32.320]  They've been positioned and given everything because the David Rockefeller went in there
[02:37:32.320 --> 02:37:35.120]  and set the deal up 40 something years ago.
[02:37:35.120 --> 02:37:42.040]  So I think it's time, and Trump's doing that, to let them know that the Pistone America
[02:37:42.040 --> 02:37:47.720]  Party is over, that it's over.
[02:37:47.720 --> 02:37:52.160]  But again, you learn about microwave weapons 20 years ago here on air.
[02:37:52.160 --> 02:37:54.560]  There's even national stories demonized, we talk about it.
[02:37:54.560 --> 02:37:55.560]  It's a fact.
[02:37:55.560 --> 02:37:56.560]  But I digress.
[02:37:56.560 --> 02:37:57.560]  Go ahead and finish your point.
[02:37:57.560 --> 02:37:58.560]  You're a point, Chase.
[02:37:58.560 --> 02:38:03.960]  Oh, yeah, you mentioned the sonic weapons, and that's a very real threat that just kind
[02:38:03.960 --> 02:38:07.320]  of started to hit the news, Mike Pompeo was talking about that.
[02:38:07.320 --> 02:38:12.600]  But on my site on YouTube, Chase the Patriot, I'd have a number of videos, including just
[02:38:12.600 --> 02:38:17.360]  this week, we saw that hypersonic nuclear weapon test in China.
[02:38:17.360 --> 02:38:22.880]  And I think that was a direct response because of our successful launch of the Falcon 9 rocket.
[02:38:22.880 --> 02:38:28.040]  And you know, the other threat, they are tremendously building up in Venezuela and
[02:38:28.040 --> 02:38:29.040]  Argentina.
[02:38:29.040 --> 02:38:34.280]  Again, the game board of risk like that old board game, China is the only one playing
[02:38:34.280 --> 02:38:35.280]  today.
[02:38:35.280 --> 02:38:40.040]  They are spreading their forces, and there are more Chinese flags in Africa today.
[02:38:40.040 --> 02:38:41.040]  No, no, I hear you.
[02:38:41.040 --> 02:38:45.120]  And again, the globalist, let's explain the globalist, shut it up to position China to
[02:38:45.120 --> 02:38:46.560]  do that because it's a dictatorship.
[02:38:46.560 --> 02:38:48.080]  I appreciate your call.
[02:38:48.080 --> 02:38:54.520]  So it's a shell out by our elites, the CFR, the Chinese century, the dragon century.
[02:38:54.520 --> 02:39:01.560]  And guess what, the dragon century is dead on arrival, but not sonic weapons, microwave
[02:39:01.560 --> 02:39:02.560]  weapons.
[02:39:02.560 --> 02:39:11.040]  All right, let's go back to the calls here.
[02:39:11.040 --> 02:39:12.040]  I'm going to do this.
[02:39:12.040 --> 02:39:14.840]  I'm just going to go from the top to the bottom here.
[02:39:14.840 --> 02:39:16.800]  Let's talk to Matt in Kentucky.
[02:39:16.800 --> 02:39:17.800]  Matt, you're on the air.
[02:39:17.800 --> 02:39:18.800]  Go ahead.
[02:39:18.800 --> 02:39:19.800]  Hey, Alex.
[02:39:19.800 --> 02:39:20.800]  How you doing?
[02:39:20.800 --> 02:39:21.800]  Good, brother.
[02:39:21.800 --> 02:39:22.800]  Good.
[02:39:22.800 --> 02:39:25.640]  You know, I'm talking about Tucker Carlson, he had a guest on, I don't know if you saw
[02:39:25.640 --> 02:39:32.080]  that, who was a previous Facebook employee who had just left the company.
[02:39:32.080 --> 02:39:34.160]  And at first I thought this was a good thing.
[02:39:34.160 --> 02:39:40.040]  He denounced their censorship of everything, but then proceeded to explain that it's not
[02:39:40.040 --> 02:39:46.040]  coming from the top of Facebook bosses, but it's like dissemination from rogue lackeys,
[02:39:46.040 --> 02:39:52.240]  I guess, within Facebook, as though they're able to get around what Zuckerberg wants.
[02:39:52.240 --> 02:39:57.320]  And maybe that's true, but to me, it sounded more like a deflection of responsibility.
[02:39:57.320 --> 02:40:01.040]  And just another example of the lack of creativity from the left.
[02:40:01.040 --> 02:40:04.360]  Well, I didn't see the report, but that's actually true.
[02:40:04.360 --> 02:40:09.640]  We knew that the big tech guys want a censor, but that the leftists they've hired, remember
[02:40:09.640 --> 02:40:12.840]  like six months ago when I got banned off YouTube for a while, and then they said, oh,
[02:40:12.840 --> 02:40:15.560]  he was put back, thousands of conservatives were banned.
[02:40:15.560 --> 02:40:18.400]  It was rogue groups that didn't understand that were poorly trained.
[02:40:18.400 --> 02:40:19.400]  No.
[02:40:19.400 --> 02:40:26.440]  And 20,000 Southern Parvy Law Center trained SJWs and just send them in there in a government
[02:40:26.440 --> 02:40:31.080]  contract that Obama set up two years ago that's still operating with billions of dollars.
[02:40:31.080 --> 02:40:34.200]  And so yes, it's pressure from above and below.
[02:40:34.200 --> 02:40:38.040]  And then the executives deny they know it's going on, but really they knew what they were
[02:40:38.040 --> 02:40:39.040]  doing.
[02:40:39.040 --> 02:40:43.480]  But do you see the plausible deniability that they just brought in the army of censors?
[02:40:43.480 --> 02:40:50.240]  Yes, and all that to say that you're banned from these platforms.
[02:40:50.240 --> 02:40:58.320]  And so it's a war and I feel like you need to use your platform and your influence right
[02:40:58.320 --> 02:41:06.280]  now to start denouncing these companies because everybody that's listening to you has seed
[02:41:06.280 --> 02:41:11.160]  planted in them that they need to like separate from these, like choose a side.
[02:41:11.160 --> 02:41:15.160]  Or we're going to try to build a more high tech, you know, basic message board posting
[02:41:15.160 --> 02:41:18.040]  system for everybody very, very soon.
[02:41:18.040 --> 02:41:19.040]  We're going to try to do it all.
[02:41:19.040 --> 02:41:23.040]  I'm just not one of these big billion dollar companies, but I mean, I'm saying they should
[02:41:23.040 --> 02:41:24.680]  be antitrusted.
[02:41:24.680 --> 02:41:28.600]  I've written reports and that law firm reports the president starting six months ago.
[02:41:28.600 --> 02:41:29.600]  That's why I was shut down.
[02:41:29.600 --> 02:41:31.400]  I've been behind the scenes and on air.
[02:41:31.400 --> 02:41:33.120]  You may have just tuned in for the first time, Matt.
[02:41:33.120 --> 02:41:35.880]  We've been leading with charge against this with Matt Drudge.
[02:41:35.880 --> 02:41:37.380]  Yes, sir.
[02:41:37.380 --> 02:41:39.560]  And I just, I removed my Facebook account.
[02:41:39.560 --> 02:41:44.280]  I deleted it completely at the end of September after, you know, being on there since 2002
[02:41:44.280 --> 02:41:48.720]  when you had to have a college email address to even get an account.
[02:41:48.720 --> 02:41:50.680]  Well, you do what you think is best.
[02:41:50.680 --> 02:41:56.640]  I think it's best to stay on there all over the place, but give it nothing but war.
[02:41:56.640 --> 02:41:59.360]  And I mean, again, the enemy has that battlefield.
[02:41:59.360 --> 02:42:00.720]  They don't want you on it.
[02:42:00.720 --> 02:42:03.680]  They want to keep you on or they can condition you and make you give in and then they're
[02:42:03.680 --> 02:42:04.880]  been to their will.
[02:42:04.880 --> 02:42:05.880]  But I would do satire.
[02:42:05.880 --> 02:42:06.880]  I'd be silly.
[02:42:06.880 --> 02:42:08.840]  You can do a crazy leftist character.
[02:42:08.840 --> 02:42:11.760]  I'm thinking about doing this by shelf where you're just over the top, hate America and
[02:42:11.760 --> 02:42:14.560]  everything, but then they'll probably think it's cool and leave it on there.
[02:42:14.560 --> 02:42:18.200]  I mean, that's how tone deaf they are.
[02:42:18.200 --> 02:42:19.200]  But I agree.
[02:42:19.200 --> 02:42:22.440]  The number one thing like Matt Drudge warned us of two and a half years ago in studio is
[02:42:22.440 --> 02:42:23.640]  beef up your own thing.
[02:42:23.640 --> 02:42:25.440]  It's going away.
[02:42:25.440 --> 02:42:26.600]  And people didn't heed his warning.
[02:42:26.600 --> 02:42:28.320]  We built our own video platform.
[02:42:28.320 --> 02:42:29.960]  Mike Adams built his real.video.
[02:42:29.960 --> 02:42:33.520]  We're, they're trying to, they're trying to take our payment processors, brother.
[02:42:33.520 --> 02:42:36.040]  They're trying to take our ability to do anything.
[02:42:36.040 --> 02:42:37.440]  There's some stuff behind the scenes.
[02:42:37.440 --> 02:42:39.040]  I don't even believe they've been doing.
[02:42:39.040 --> 02:42:42.840]  I mean, I know for a fact, I'm not going to even get into it, but, but yeah, I hear you.
[02:42:42.840 --> 02:42:43.840]  Believe me.
[02:42:43.840 --> 02:42:44.840]  I know what we need to do.
[02:42:44.840 --> 02:42:45.840]  I agree with you.
[02:42:45.840 --> 02:42:46.840]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:46.840 --> 02:42:47.840]  Thanks, Matt and Kentucky.
[02:42:47.840 --> 02:42:52.160]  More calls straight ahead and the latest, the latest on Google admitting that they perjured
[02:42:52.160 --> 02:42:54.160]  themselves to Congress.
[02:42:54.160 --> 02:42:59.680]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or
[02:42:59.680 --> 02:43:03.960]  to go for a run or go to the park or heck even take your dog for a walk.
[02:43:03.960 --> 02:43:04.960]  Believe me.
[02:43:04.960 --> 02:43:05.960]  I know.
[02:43:05.960 --> 02:43:09.920]  There's hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:43:09.920 --> 02:43:15.200]  But thanks to supermail vitality at infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[02:43:15.200 --> 02:43:19.400]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against
[02:43:19.400 --> 02:43:23.600]  the chemicals and the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with
[02:43:23.600 --> 02:43:28.560]  the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy
[02:43:28.560 --> 02:43:35.800]  and drive to get to the gym, get to the park and get exercise that you need for your health.
[02:43:35.800 --> 02:43:40.280]  To go to infowarstore.com and get supermail vitality before it's gone, this is actually
[02:43:40.280 --> 02:43:43.440]  our last run of supermail vitality.
[02:43:43.440 --> 02:43:48.360]  So I want you to experience supermail vitality before it's too late.
[02:43:48.360 --> 02:43:51.360]  Unleash the supermail in you.
[02:43:51.360 --> 02:43:52.480]  Supermail vitality.
[02:43:52.480 --> 02:43:55.480]  Go to infowarstore.com.
[02:43:55.480 --> 02:44:00.720]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[02:44:00.720 --> 02:44:03.680]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party.
[02:44:03.680 --> 02:44:08.680]  Not just CIA operatives, the corrupt justice department and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[02:44:08.680 --> 02:44:11.280]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[02:44:11.280 --> 02:44:14.640]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[02:44:14.640 --> 02:44:17.240]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[02:44:17.240 --> 02:44:19.600]  So we've already had incredible success.
[02:44:19.600 --> 02:44:24.480]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is and
[02:44:24.480 --> 02:44:29.320]  why we've been made the main target and if you financially support us and if you spread
[02:44:29.320 --> 02:44:35.040]  the word about our articles and videos, infowars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against
[02:44:35.040 --> 02:44:38.040]  these brutal scumbags, we'll win.
[02:44:38.040 --> 02:44:40.400]  We have huge sales at infowarsstore.com right now.
[02:44:40.400 --> 02:44:44.520]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you despite
[02:44:44.520 --> 02:44:48.120]  the fact that we're trying to block our commerce and you're right to the market.
[02:44:48.120 --> 02:44:51.800]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Globals may win.
[02:44:51.800 --> 02:44:56.080]  This is InfoWars Darkness Hour, we do your support, I'm counting on you.
[02:44:56.080 --> 02:45:01.080]  Next two, we were selling it for about three years and then they found out how big it was
[02:45:01.080 --> 02:45:04.760]  and I was, we were buying and they said, oh, we want more money, more money, and oh, this
[02:45:04.760 --> 02:45:05.760]  and that.
[02:45:05.760 --> 02:45:11.040]  And so I've broken my contract and right now we can't get more of this proprietary ingredient
[02:45:11.040 --> 02:45:14.640]  that goes in next to it that literally is so pure that if you put it in a peaker dish
[02:45:14.640 --> 02:45:19.800]  on top of 90 degree hot plate, it gasses, like I dream of genie and then it's purple
[02:45:19.800 --> 02:45:20.800]  gas.
[02:45:20.800 --> 02:45:23.680]  I mean, that is so pure it just goes right into your body when you take it.
[02:45:23.680 --> 02:45:29.280]  We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now, but I bought a huge amount of it,
[02:45:29.280 --> 02:45:33.320]  ordered it six months ago, so I get the price down and I said, if you don't lower it, I'm
[02:45:33.320 --> 02:45:34.320]  done, I'm breaking the contract.
[02:45:34.320 --> 02:45:39.080]  Well, I broke the contract last week and so this is potentially the last run.
[02:45:39.080 --> 02:45:44.200]  In fact, right now it is the last run, which is Bible Shield X2 and we've got a good supply
[02:45:44.200 --> 02:45:45.200]  of it.
[02:45:45.200 --> 02:45:46.200]  It'll be gone in a couple of months.
[02:45:46.200 --> 02:45:51.480]  X2, if you haven't experienced it, InfoWarsShore.com, if you have experienced it, I suggest you
[02:45:51.480 --> 02:45:52.480]  stock up on it.
[02:45:52.480 --> 02:45:55.560]  It's available right now for a limited time at InfoWarsShore.com right now.
[02:45:55.560 --> 02:46:01.240]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from InfoWars.com, when you spread the videos,
[02:46:01.240 --> 02:46:03.480]  you are changing the world?
[02:46:03.480 --> 02:46:07.200]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the Globlest.
[02:46:07.200 --> 02:46:11.760]  It is you, the Info Warriors, across the planet that stood against the bullying, that stood
[02:46:11.760 --> 02:46:15.720]  against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats that have now changed the world.
[02:46:15.720 --> 02:46:20.520]  And that's why you've been on the team supporting us, praying for us and spreading the word.
[02:46:20.520 --> 02:46:21.520]  You are the InfoWars.
[02:46:21.520 --> 02:46:26.560]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone
[02:46:26.560 --> 02:46:31.640]  go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the
[02:46:31.640 --> 02:46:37.520]  censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[02:46:37.520 --> 02:46:43.080]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos,
[02:46:43.080 --> 02:46:45.480]  to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[02:46:45.480 --> 02:46:52.560]  So bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:46:52.560 --> 02:46:59.520]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[02:46:59.520 --> 02:47:07.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:47:07.840 --> 02:47:14.840]  Well I was thumbing from Montgomery, I had my guitar on my back, when a stranger stopped
[02:47:14.840 --> 02:47:17.200]  beside me in an antique Cadillac.
[02:47:17.200 --> 02:47:26.760]  He was dressed like 1950, half drunk and hollow eyed, he said it's a long walk to Nashville.
[02:47:26.760 --> 02:47:28.960]  Would you like to ride, son?
[02:47:28.960 --> 02:47:35.640]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[02:47:35.640 --> 02:47:36.640]  the InfoWars.
[02:47:36.640 --> 02:47:41.800]  This is kind of the country version of it's a long way to the top if you want to rock
[02:47:41.800 --> 02:47:42.800]  and roll.
[02:47:42.800 --> 02:47:47.000]  I politically incorrect David Ellen Cove, who is definitely crazy.
[02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:54.000]  Let's listen to a little bit of this, this is a Hank Williams song, it's a Hank Williams
[02:47:54.000 --> 02:48:11.520]  ghost song, he said, can you bend down your guitar strings, I said boy can you make folks
[02:48:11.520 --> 02:48:18.400]  feel what you feel inside, cause if you're big star bound let me warn you it's a long
[02:48:18.400 --> 02:48:19.400]  ride.
[02:48:19.400 --> 02:48:27.200]  Big star bound, let me warn you it's a long hard ride, there's a cry south of Nashville.
[02:48:27.200 --> 02:48:29.200]  Then he cried just south of Nashville.
[02:48:29.200 --> 02:48:34.840]  Alright let's stop right there, I want to go to your phone calls and I'm going to start
[02:48:34.840 --> 02:48:38.920]  the next hour before Matt Bracken takes over, I thought it was Mike Adams and Matt Bracken,
[02:48:38.920 --> 02:48:42.200]  they're both awesome, and then of course the war rooms come up with the destroyer, busted
[02:48:42.200 --> 02:48:49.480]  voter fraud ring, discovered in Texas mainstream news, in Texas no national coverage I've seen,
[02:48:49.480 --> 02:48:50.480]  that's coming up.
[02:48:50.480 --> 02:48:57.800]  That's exactly what we said, they always say stop illegal aliens voting, I'll demonize
[02:48:57.800 --> 02:49:03.000]  illegal aliens when they're doing bad stuff, and on average illegal aliens are not criminals
[02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:05.800]  other than breaking the law to come here, they're looking for work, but the ones that
[02:49:05.800 --> 02:49:09.840]  are criminals are particularly criminal, that's why the illegal alien is twice as likely
[02:49:09.840 --> 02:49:12.960]  than the other group to commit a crime, cause what do you got to lose, plus you have anonymity,
[02:49:12.960 --> 02:49:18.320]  it's almost like a get out of jail free card, but it's not illegal aliens voting, it's
[02:49:18.320 --> 02:49:21.880]  Democrats with list of dead people that are still in the voter rolls, and that's right
[02:49:21.880 --> 02:49:26.880]  here.
[02:49:26.880 --> 02:49:30.920]  So I'm not Mr. White Knight defending the illegal aliens here, with the anchor babies
[02:49:30.920 --> 02:49:34.720]  and all of it, I don't care where you came from, Eastern Europe, China, Mexico, whatever,
[02:49:34.720 --> 02:49:38.960]  but it's not the illegal aliens, that's why Obama had to go on TV two years ago and say
[02:49:38.960 --> 02:49:43.000]  it doesn't matter if you're here, you should vote, while the Democrats try to say it's
[02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:47.160]  legal now, if you're an illegal vote, the Mexicans and Latin Americans don't show up
[02:49:47.160 --> 02:49:51.760]  and vote illegally, they have a sense of like that's criminal, I'm not a citizen yet, I'm
[02:49:51.760 --> 02:49:56.360]  not gonna do it, but they got the winos and the drunks and they're Mexican, they're black,
[02:49:56.360 --> 02:50:02.680]  they're white or whatever, and man they're in there voting big time, and we got Project
[02:50:02.680 --> 02:50:06.960]  Veritas' undercover video, it's well known the Democrats do this, on average they give
[02:50:06.960 --> 02:50:11.080]  them beer, whiskey, you name it, they get them on buses, they try to not give them too much
[02:50:11.080 --> 02:50:18.200]  alcohol up front, some of them want other drugs, and on average they vote 10 times in
[02:50:18.200 --> 02:50:26.760]  states that don't have voter ID, but they do it in Texas even though we have voter ID,
[02:50:26.760 --> 02:50:32.640]  because they do it with absentee ballots, see I always say I'm gonna get to it and I get
[02:50:32.640 --> 02:50:36.080]  to it right up front, I'm not the guy that has cliffhangers, let's go ahead and go to
[02:50:36.080 --> 02:50:40.360]  this report right now, it's on infohorses.com, I'm gonna have it retweeted, I think I've
[02:50:40.360 --> 02:50:47.000]  asked Watson to retweet it, this needs to get out, we'll go to your calls Joseph and
[02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:51.360]  Tommy and Chris and Comedic Genius, we're gonna get to you and Marco and everybody else
[02:50:51.360 --> 02:50:58.360]  is patiently holding, but here is at least part of this report from Texas News, what
[02:50:58.360 --> 02:51:01.520]  is it CBS, it's also an NBC, here it is.
[02:51:01.520 --> 02:51:18.680]  For women are accused of being part of a paid voter fraud ring in Tarrant County, right
[02:51:18.680 --> 02:51:23.800]  Gilma and that spring there were more than 16,000 ballots that were mailed in here to
[02:51:23.800 --> 02:51:29.280]  the Tarrant County Election Center, now investigators believe that for some of those ballots voters
[02:51:29.280 --> 02:51:33.160]  hadn't asked for them, they hadn't filled them out and they didn't know that somebody
[02:51:33.160 --> 02:51:36.280]  else did.
[02:51:36.280 --> 02:51:41.240]  While voters were picking presidential candidates at the polls in 2016, ballots sent in by mail
[02:51:41.240 --> 02:51:46.120]  in Tarrant County had what investigators now believe were fraudulence, signatures and
[02:51:46.120 --> 02:51:47.120]  information.
[02:51:47.120 --> 02:51:50.040]  It doesn't match up, this was an accepted ballot.
[02:51:50.040 --> 02:51:54.160]  Political consultant Aaron Harris found a paper trail that he handed over to state investigators
[02:51:54.160 --> 02:51:58.320]  that helped lead to nearly 30 felony counts against four women.
[02:51:58.320 --> 02:52:02.520]  The women including Letitia Sanchez and Letitia Tepechen are accused of requesting ballots
[02:52:02.520 --> 02:52:07.320]  for elderly voters, forging signatures, filling those ballots out and mailing them in.
[02:52:07.320 --> 02:52:11.640]  So the harvesters sit around and fill these out by the hundreds, often by the thousands.
[02:52:11.640 --> 02:52:16.000]  Back in 2016, Governor Greg Abbott posted on Twitter about the fraud investigation in
[02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:19.760]  Tarrant County and while the Attorney General's office referred to the indictments as part
[02:52:19.760 --> 02:52:24.720]  of a paid ring, they would not comment on if there would be more charges to come.
[02:52:24.720 --> 02:52:28.640]  Investors told us his own research has turned up many more people involved, but recognize
[02:52:28.640 --> 02:52:31.280]  the cases are difficult to prosecute.
[02:52:31.280 --> 02:52:37.240]  Just because they may have only been indicted on one or ten or sixteen counts doesn't mean
[02:52:37.240 --> 02:52:44.920]  they don't have two hundred counts, but those are the only sixteen they can be proven.
[02:52:44.920 --> 02:52:48.360]  The indictment shows that at least in these cases, many of the ballots involved were for
[02:52:48.360 --> 02:52:49.600]  Democratic candidates.
[02:52:49.600 --> 02:52:52.800]  I talked to the Tarrant County Democratic Party chair tonight.
[02:52:52.800 --> 02:52:56.720]  He had met one of the women who was involved, but really didn't know the details of the
[02:52:56.720 --> 02:53:00.880]  case and she also questioned the timing of these indictments just a few weeks before
[02:53:00.880 --> 02:53:03.480]  the November midterm elections.
[02:53:03.480 --> 02:53:05.480]  No kidding, Sherlock.
[02:53:05.480 --> 02:53:07.480]  Bravo, Sierra.
[02:53:07.480 --> 02:53:11.720]  We ought to go find those videos from a year ago, Battleground, Texas, Turn Texas Blue.
[02:53:11.720 --> 02:53:16.360]  They're on video saying we're going to have illegal aliens vote, but I was like, that's
[02:53:16.360 --> 02:53:17.360]  a red herring.
[02:53:17.360 --> 02:53:22.480]  They just go to the nursing homes, get all the names, get them out of the newspaper,
[02:53:22.480 --> 02:53:23.480]  get people that died.
[02:53:23.480 --> 02:53:24.480]  They have them sent to them.
[02:53:24.480 --> 02:53:25.480]  They fell them out.
[02:53:25.480 --> 02:53:26.480]  It's industrial.
[02:53:26.480 --> 02:53:34.120]  Reportedly, they get like two hundred dollars for every vote they get, but I mean, the Democrats
[02:53:34.120 --> 02:53:35.320]  don't know about it.
[02:53:35.320 --> 02:53:40.200]  I bet you all the tea in China and India that these people are part of Battleground, Texas.
[02:53:40.200 --> 02:53:43.120]  I mean, this is how the Democrats operate.
[02:53:43.120 --> 02:53:44.120]  It's what they do.
[02:53:44.120 --> 02:53:46.080]  It's what the Clintons did.
[02:53:46.080 --> 02:53:51.120]  It's like asking, does Smokey the Bear pull his pants down and use the bathroom in the
[02:53:51.120 --> 02:53:52.480]  woods?
[02:53:52.480 --> 02:53:54.000]  And the answer is yes, he craps in the woods.
[02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:55.240]  He's not wearing pants.
[02:53:55.240 --> 02:53:56.680]  He's a bear.
[02:53:56.680 --> 02:54:02.200]  And I don't even know what to say at this point anymore, and these people are, oh, Trump's
[02:54:02.200 --> 02:54:03.200]  crazy.
[02:54:03.200 --> 02:54:04.200]  Nobody's voting illegally.
[02:54:04.200 --> 02:54:07.360]  And there's all these undercover videos of them doing it, and it's so hard to catch
[02:54:07.360 --> 02:54:08.360]  these folks.
[02:54:08.360 --> 02:54:09.360]  And this guy's awesome.
[02:54:09.360 --> 02:54:13.480]  I want to get that fellow that did this on so we can duplicate this and expose this crap.
[02:54:13.480 --> 02:54:16.960]  Now, let me tell you how you counter them.
[02:54:16.960 --> 02:54:20.840]  You get at least five people, you know, that aren't lazy, but are busy, and they've never
[02:54:20.840 --> 02:54:23.400]  really voted, so whatever.
[02:54:23.400 --> 02:54:28.280]  You get that voter registration filed now, you do an affidavit, whatever you got to do,
[02:54:28.280 --> 02:54:32.320]  you get them to vote, or grandma hadn't voted in a few years because her hips hurt, or grandpa
[02:54:32.320 --> 02:54:33.320]  or whatever.
[02:54:33.320 --> 02:54:37.800]  You take them, you stick them in the wheelchair because you love them, and you love the unborn.
[02:54:37.800 --> 02:54:38.800]  We're going to save.
[02:54:38.800 --> 02:54:43.600]  We can get Ted Cruz and other stuff, and you take them down, and you have them vote Republican
[02:54:43.600 --> 02:54:45.280]  straight ticket now.
[02:54:45.280 --> 02:54:49.960]  We're not going to engage in fraud, but I'll tell you this, we're going to outwork these
[02:54:49.960 --> 02:54:56.840]  dirty, Soros-funded pieces of crap.
[02:54:56.840 --> 02:55:00.560]  I'm not even sure if I'm going to vote early or vote on the day.
[02:55:00.560 --> 02:55:05.640]  Man, I'm getting angry right now.
[02:55:05.640 --> 02:55:10.680]  I'm going to tell you, they want to steal our birthright, they're engaged in such fraud,
[02:55:10.680 --> 02:55:13.280]  and I'm just telling you, you've got to vote.
[02:55:13.280 --> 02:55:14.280]  They're going to be engaged.
[02:55:14.280 --> 02:55:19.320]  But here's the good news, state police, state homeland security, and everybody all over the
[02:55:19.320 --> 02:55:20.960]  nation is watching.
[02:55:20.960 --> 02:55:24.160]  We stopped Hillary from stealing five states.
[02:55:24.160 --> 02:55:29.000]  She stole six states, and we're going to stop them this time.
[02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:40.800]  But I just love them saying, Trump's crazy, nobody voted illegally, Balderdash, Horsemaner,
[02:55:40.800 --> 02:55:41.800]  donkey droppings.
[02:55:41.800 --> 02:55:47.480]  All right, I'll go to your calls for a couple of statements.
[02:55:47.480 --> 02:55:48.480]  Matt's always good.
[02:55:48.480 --> 02:55:51.480]  One of the things I take over sometimes, I swear I get to your calls.
[02:55:51.480 --> 02:55:54.440]  The problem is that they fill up the calls after I hang up with them.
[02:55:54.440 --> 02:55:55.440]  Everybody's been holding the longest.
[02:55:55.440 --> 02:55:56.920]  I'll just go to whoever's been holding the longest.
[02:55:56.920 --> 02:55:57.920]  I love hearing from you.
[02:55:57.920 --> 02:55:58.920]  You're awesome.
[02:55:58.920 --> 02:56:03.640]  Listen, I talked about excitement earlier, and the spirit of liberty.
[02:56:03.640 --> 02:56:11.480]  When you get exciting, nothing on earth can stop you, nothing.
[02:56:11.480 --> 02:56:15.480]  And when you get excited about telling people about the local radio stations you're listening
[02:56:15.480 --> 02:56:19.520]  to, or local TV stations, or when you share the links to infowars.com, force.ly, show
[02:56:19.520 --> 02:56:22.360]  them in, you're not the lifeblood of info wars.
[02:56:22.360 --> 02:56:25.640]  Let me tell you, if they knock me out tomorrow, but we saved the country, I'd be happy to
[02:56:25.640 --> 02:56:26.640]  be off the air.
[02:56:26.640 --> 02:56:27.640]  I mean, I'm committed.
[02:56:27.640 --> 02:56:31.320]  I like doing this, but I wouldn't mind stopping it because it's, it's, it's, you know, passion
[02:56:31.320 --> 02:56:32.960]  is your leader totally committed.
[02:56:32.960 --> 02:56:39.000]  But then after you're like out of the fire, like, good God, I just blew a gasket.
[02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:40.000]  This isn't about me.
[02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:41.000]  It's about all of us.
[02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:46.960]  I'm telling you, when you financially support us, you are the hand of God in our life.
[02:56:46.960 --> 02:56:48.280]  God's working through you.
[02:56:48.280 --> 02:56:49.280]  I am in your hands.
[02:56:49.280 --> 02:56:50.280]  You know what you're in?
[02:56:50.280 --> 02:56:51.280]  Good hands at all state.
[02:56:51.280 --> 02:56:57.240]  Alex Jones and info wars and everything we do, and God is a train wreck sometimes, but
[02:56:57.240 --> 02:56:58.240]  it's real.
[02:56:58.240 --> 02:57:01.120]  It's from the heart.

[03:00:42.520 --> 03:00:45.880]  We're taking calls for two more segments and Matt Bracken's loaded for bear, ton of critical
[03:00:45.880 --> 03:00:51.320]  info coming up and you know I never got to China and in Google.
[03:00:51.320 --> 03:00:57.520]  You know what Google's done is show bad and perjuring themselves to Congress and all of
[03:00:57.520 --> 03:01:01.360]  it and now admitting all the censorship and saying it's good doing a 180 oh we can't cover
[03:01:01.360 --> 03:01:05.840]  it up let's just hide it in plain view.
[03:01:05.840 --> 03:01:10.600]  I couldn't imagine coming to this country like Sundar and making five billion dollars
[03:01:10.600 --> 03:01:16.600]  or his bosses that have made hundreds of billions off this country and then DARPA gave them
[03:01:16.600 --> 03:01:25.400]  all this and then they give it to China and piss all over the country but see they're
[03:01:25.400 --> 03:01:30.520]  scared of China and they're enamored with it so they're going along with it but that's
[03:01:30.520 --> 03:01:32.520]  coming up.
[03:01:32.520 --> 03:01:41.280]  Nancy in Texas she's got comments on Pito or Rourke I'm sorry Beto or Rourke and Ted
[03:01:41.280 --> 03:01:45.560]  Cruz go ahead.
[03:01:45.560 --> 03:01:51.480]  And I'm from El Paso I don't live there now but my family most of my family is still out
[03:01:51.480 --> 03:01:56.520]  there and where do I start?
[03:01:56.520 --> 03:02:04.320]  I called into their campaign headquarters the other day and I just wanted to see what they'd
[03:02:04.320 --> 03:02:11.720]  say and I told a lady I said look I'm from El Paso I know El Paso politics and I said
[03:02:11.720 --> 03:02:14.920]  how in the world did he get 30 million dollars?
[03:02:14.920 --> 03:02:19.600]  I said I read that it came from George Soros which I think is probably about a hundred
[03:02:19.600 --> 03:02:20.600]  percent correct.
[03:02:20.600 --> 03:02:28.920]  Well let me stop you because this is so key he says El Paso is the safest place in the
[03:02:28.920 --> 03:02:32.360]  country it's one of the most dangerous that's admitted nothing is El Paso it's right on
[03:02:32.360 --> 03:02:38.520]  the border and as you said Ted Cruz pointed that out but yes he raised 36 million the
[03:02:38.520 --> 03:02:43.560]  last month he's raised way more than that last year it's like presidential level and
[03:02:43.560 --> 03:02:48.480]  it turned out it's all big foundation money Soros Democratic Party yeah he said it's all
[03:02:48.480 --> 03:02:55.360]  little old ladies again the guy is a liar she was a nice lady and I was nice to her
[03:02:55.360 --> 03:03:00.880]  but I didn't let her go away with anything and I said come on now I'm from El Paso you
[03:03:00.880 --> 03:03:05.640]  gotta be kidding me you know and oh it's just a little donation and I said let me tell you
[03:03:05.640 --> 03:03:10.000]  let me tell you what Beto does not know I said he really he really ripped his doors when
[03:03:10.000 --> 03:03:17.120]  he said this was just cracking me up that Mexicans are still picking cotton no my family
[03:03:17.120 --> 03:03:22.640]  I'm a family of farmers my dad my uncles were all farmers out east of El Paso they've had
[03:03:22.640 --> 03:03:27.200]  cotton pickers for more than 50 years since the early 60s they've had cotton pickers
[03:03:27.200 --> 03:03:36.000]  it's like got him on that one what else have you got you know and she's well he's such
[03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:40.200]  a joke and what about him saying his mothers are Republican first they got the numbers
[03:03:40.200 --> 03:03:44.600]  that she was voting Democrat in 2000 now it's coming out that she volunteered for the Democrats
[03:03:44.600 --> 03:03:51.400]  in the 70s so everything about him is a fraud is a fraud yeah he's a total fraud no surprise

[03:06:38.380 --> 03:06:46.780]  many areas where we would provide information better than what's available and I don't mind
[03:06:46.780 --> 03:06:54.180]  them switching sides and standing up for things they believe in but when they're running down

[03:09:12.660 --> 03:09:17.220]  incredible total complete fraud but it just shows how stupid they think we are but even
[03:09:17.220 --> 03:09:22.220]  political admits it blew up in her stinking face let's talk to Joseph in New Mexico worried
[03:09:22.220 --> 03:09:27.340]  about 1984 censorship false flag yeah I'm worried about false flags they just busted
[03:09:27.340 --> 03:09:31.500]  this leftist that wanted to blow up 200 pound bomb on election day to stop the election
[03:09:31.500 --> 03:09:35.820]  because he thought the Republicans were going to stop the election hmm so yeah I think we're
[03:09:35.820 --> 03:09:41.060]  in false flag territory 20 days out what do you think Joseph hey what's going on Alex
[03:09:41.060 --> 03:09:45.460]  thanks for having me on thank you for calling believe you are correct first off I want to
[03:09:45.460 --> 03:09:49.820]  thank everyone I want to thank your whole staff everything you guys do I encourage all your
[03:09:49.820 --> 03:09:53.060]  folks to buy the supplements I have many of my family members and other people buying
[03:09:53.060 --> 03:09:59.060]  them thank you aside from that George Orwell said in his book he said power is in tearing
[03:09:59.060 --> 03:10:03.940]  human minds to pieces and then putting them together again in their new choosing and as
[03:10:03.940 --> 03:10:09.100]  you can see the freedom that is hot that we used to have it's being torn and swept right
[03:10:09.100 --> 03:10:15.260]  under us he said the stranglehold that was on the American people is I'm sorry I'm sorry
[03:10:15.260 --> 03:10:20.060]  I say the stranglehold that is on the American people is being loosened every day what's happening
[03:10:20.060 --> 03:10:25.940]  Alex is prophetic the oligarch they see this and they're like cornered rats I believe in
[03:10:25.940 --> 03:10:30.420]  the MP or maybe even a mini nuke as we know the nukes were missing back you know back
[03:10:30.420 --> 03:10:34.460]  a couple years back what do you think that they might pull this off before the midterms
[03:10:34.460 --> 03:10:38.420]  that's a great question let's bring Matt Bracken in now that's a great question thank you Joseph
[03:10:38.420 --> 03:10:42.940]  what do you think Matt Bracken former Navy SEAL best-selling author researcher you predicted
[03:10:42.940 --> 03:10:46.660]  a lot of what's already happened so far I think they have any of the block roads try
[03:10:46.660 --> 03:10:50.740]  to get run over maybe blow something up blame it on right wingers maybe shoot something
[03:10:50.740 --> 03:10:55.980]  up blame right wingers like you said shoot into a sports stadium you see them saying
[03:10:55.980 --> 03:10:59.540]  Trump's going to get the media killed I'm going to get the media killed and lying and
[03:10:59.540 --> 03:11:02.740]  saying we're calling for media to be killed I think that's the strongest indication they're
[03:11:02.740 --> 03:11:13.500]  pre-programming for that I think that the the most of that you don't need a suicidal
[03:11:13.500 --> 03:11:21.140]  guy at this point would be you know I hesitate to you know give anybody ideas but just shooting
[03:11:21.140 --> 03:11:27.140]  up a line of people going into a polling station in a couple of places early in the morning
[03:11:27.140 --> 03:11:32.740]  would cause a enough of a panic be blown up in the media sky high you know right wing
[03:11:32.740 --> 03:11:37.340]  literature would be left at the scene of where the shell casings are located then there'd
[03:11:37.340 --> 03:11:43.420]  be a call to call to halt the elections and then at the end of the day the elections would
[03:11:43.420 --> 03:11:47.580]  be right they'll say voter intimidation voter intimidation someone shot up an early polling
[03:11:47.580 --> 03:11:55.220]  place we cannot put up with this we need investigation halt the election exactly and as a as a result
[03:11:55.220 --> 03:12:00.340]  of the of the shooting then the election results would be called suppressed they would say
[03:12:00.340 --> 03:12:05.220]  well all around the country and all 40 all the all 50 states you know oppressed minorities
[03:12:05.220 --> 03:12:09.740]  were afraid to go to the polling stations therefore the results are invalid and that
[03:12:09.740 --> 03:12:14.140]  creates the outrage mom for a new election which they dreamed about in the wargaming
[03:12:14.140 --> 03:12:19.100]  in Atlantic Monthly for the removal of the president having new elections you're on target
[03:12:19.100 --> 03:12:25.740]  as their plan is to stage a civil emergency and have new elections and something I just
[03:12:25.740 --> 03:12:31.180]  wanted to sneak in the last guy mentioned old missing nukes and you know wherever we
[03:12:31.180 --> 03:12:37.540]  can we want to put people's fears aside people don't generally recognize this but nukes have
[03:12:37.540 --> 03:12:45.940]  a shelf life the stuff is so corrosive that even the titanium and stainless steel parts
[03:12:45.940 --> 03:12:53.660]  around it turn into Swiss cheese and every you know when a schedule they have to be rebuilt
[03:12:53.660 --> 03:13:03.780]  so you know yeah at most and and have any kind of reliability so well then the core
[03:13:03.780 --> 03:13:08.580]  might be intact and if you had suicidal guys that could put together a few still there
[03:13:08.580 --> 03:13:15.420]  but that's only be a dirty bomb or it could be created it could be put into an old artillery
[03:13:15.420 --> 03:13:22.220]  shell Hiroshima type bomb which would still be very devastating firing a bullet into a
[03:13:22.220 --> 03:13:28.500]  uranium shell well or just two two subcritical masses shot together it wouldn't be as efficient
[03:13:28.500 --> 03:13:36.020]  as a as a you know a modern a hemispherical bomb but you know Hiroshima it worked you
[03:13:36.020 --> 03:13:40.540]  know it wouldn't be as efficient but it would work the key is that we have people that can
[03:13:40.540 --> 03:13:49.300]  detect these chunks of nuclear and helicopters that pick it right up that's right so it's
[03:13:49.300 --> 03:13:53.660]  not easy to move around and and the knuckleheads that we're up against I would say you know
[03:13:53.660 --> 03:13:59.140]  it's a million times more likely that somebody would shoot up a polling place leave right
[03:13:59.140 --> 03:14:04.820]  wing literature and you know cast a poll over the legitimacy of the election that's the
[03:14:04.820 --> 03:14:09.180]  way it would happen and then and then there's the old standby that you see in places like
[03:14:09.180 --> 03:14:14.900]  Baltimore or Chicago Philadelphia where you know it's a more by some miraculous process
[03:14:14.900 --> 03:14:20.220]  certain precincts turn in a hundred percent or over a hundred percent voting of the voters
[03:14:20.220 --> 03:14:24.340]  and what they've always done you know this is strictly anecdotal I was never in these
[03:14:24.340 --> 03:14:29.260]  rooms but I've been hearing it all my life starting back in you know Baltimore also in
[03:14:29.260 --> 03:14:35.540]  Philly that if you have a a poll watcher who's part of it of the team so you how you designate
[03:14:35.540 --> 03:14:40.820]  somebody to be a re a quote-unquote Republican poll watcher but there's just a stooge sure
[03:14:40.820 --> 03:14:44.620]  no they have the last election you've got these places that go a hundred and twenty
[03:14:44.620 --> 03:14:48.580]  percent Democrat it's not just like registered voters were a hundred percent which is impossible
[03:14:48.580 --> 03:14:51.500]  it'll be a hundred and twenty for Hillary so they have these key places they really
[03:14:51.500 --> 03:14:56.940]  stuff them right they wait till the polls close and then they look at the at the registration
[03:14:56.940 --> 03:15:02.420]  list and see who didn't show up everybody who's who's on the list and that's why it's
[03:15:02.420 --> 03:15:06.340]  so dangerous if you're on the rolls not to vote you just hit the key folks if you're
[03:15:06.340 --> 03:15:11.740]  a registered voter you better vote or the Democrats are gonna vote in your name right
[03:15:11.740 --> 03:15:17.500]  exactly that's how it works look man I appreciate you taking over today I swore to go to these

[03:19:22.380 --> 03:19:27.180]  the fungus is in the gut so this is the time to take advantage of getting this new incredible
[03:19:27.180 --> 03:19:31.820]  fiber product and these other products you get them separately or together and make really

[03:19:36.180 --> 03:19:42.820]  these products to you bodies sold out of a month strongest concentrated turmeric formula
[03:19:42.820 --> 03:19:47.580]  we could come up with it sold out for another month and a half we sold it at 50% off till
[03:19:47.580 --> 03:19:52.620]  it sold out and I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber get yours today in
[03:19:52.620 --> 03:20:11.300]  4s life dot com you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:20:11.300 --> 03:20:20.980]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show you know CNN's running
[03:20:20.980 --> 03:20:26.060]  a big shy off and others now they're saying veto's gonna lose because last time they said
[03:20:26.060 --> 03:20:30.380]  Hillary was gonna win it and bear some of their fake polls but they put so many people
[03:20:30.380 --> 03:20:34.500]  out there to buy votes to have dead people vote the names of dead people that they want
[03:20:34.500 --> 03:20:38.740]  you to think it's a shoe in don't listen to that get out there and vote for Ted Cruz it's
[03:20:38.740 --> 03:20:45.540]  so important whatever CNN says it's the opposite that they're not creative they invert reality
[03:20:45.540 --> 03:20:51.900]  we're taking a few final calls here and then let Matt Bracken take over but Matt what keeps
[03:20:51.900 --> 03:20:56.940]  you asleep at night we're 20 days out we are winning nationalist candidates are either
[03:20:56.940 --> 03:21:03.140]  winning in primaries are winning from Brazil to Europe Markle they've had like what 15 elections
[03:21:03.140 --> 03:21:07.020]  and she's lost everyone's she's about to be out again folks they're parliamentary so it
[03:21:07.020 --> 03:21:10.900]  takes a lot longer when somebody's a dominant party everything they're doing is turning
[03:21:10.900 --> 03:21:15.580]  to crap but I don't want to be that guy that is like Hillary and gets too confident I want
[03:21:15.580 --> 03:21:19.860]  to be now right when we're getting the big you ever had like a huge fish you're getting
[03:21:19.860 --> 03:21:24.620]  the boat one time we caught this big tuna we're gonna sell for like $5,000 out in the
[03:21:24.620 --> 03:21:27.740]  Gulf of Mexico we were actually we did get it in and sell it and made our money back
[03:21:27.740 --> 03:21:30.860]  and everything from the big trip the whole trip was paid for with it you know the hotel
[03:21:30.860 --> 03:21:34.540]  everything we're out there fishing for five days but it's like you don't want to count
[03:21:34.540 --> 03:21:38.900]  a fish till it's in the boat and gaffed and into the ice so what are you worried about
[03:21:38.900 --> 03:21:43.460]  is this big-ass fish of American restoration is right up to the boat what do we do how
[03:21:43.460 --> 03:21:49.900]  do we lose this well you have to factor in probably a 5% margin for cheating by the other
[03:21:49.900 --> 03:21:55.780]  side so you can't say we're gonna win by 1% if you you know if you if you think you're
[03:21:55.780 --> 03:22:00.580]  gonna get it over the line with 1% it's not gonna work they'll do a recount they'll find
[03:22:00.580 --> 03:22:07.100]  suitcases floating in the bay full of uncounted ballot so you know you've got to actually
[03:22:07.100 --> 03:22:11.820]  just headstomp them and they showed exactly and they showed their crazed they'll do anything
[03:22:11.820 --> 03:22:17.340]  now yeah and their tricks haven't worked they've rolled out one October surprise after another
[03:22:17.340 --> 03:22:23.540]  and they've all blown up in their faces like trick cigars in Kavanaugh was a was a you
[03:22:23.540 --> 03:22:30.460]  know trick cigar blew up Warren with the Indian thing blew up Beto O'Rourke he thinks he can
[03:22:30.460 --> 03:22:35.380]  control the narrative and and it doesn't work anymore this is one of the beauties of Trump
[03:22:35.380 --> 03:22:40.420]  is that he's shown how to how to counterattack and counterpunch these guys to not just be
[03:22:40.420 --> 03:22:46.580]  wimps like Romney I mean even Lindsey Graham has turned from a wimp into a warrior you know
[03:22:46.580 --> 03:22:51.220]  this is because of Trump's leadership in showing you know okay sometimes I throw yeah that's
[03:22:51.220 --> 03:22:58.140]  the Mark Twain quote the the the patriot is scarce in the beginning right and so and so
[03:22:58.140 --> 03:23:04.100]  now you know courage courage is effective in infectious excuse me but my fear is that the
[03:23:04.100 --> 03:23:10.260]  Democrats seeing their power slipping away their Supreme Court Politburo is no longer
[03:23:10.260 --> 03:23:16.300]  under their control if they are looking at a lost election even on the in the lead up
[03:23:16.300 --> 03:23:22.100]  to the election they might do something to disrupt it like a false flag attack or afterwards
[03:23:22.100 --> 03:23:26.300]  they'll come up with all kind of ways of no I agree but I don't think Matt it's a question
[03:23:26.300 --> 03:23:30.540]  of if if they think they can pull it off but they know they're being watched is why they're
[03:23:30.540 --> 03:23:37.060]  badly coordinated now if they think they can get away with it they're going to pull it
[03:23:37.060 --> 03:23:42.020]  and these guys that are willing to go out on the street in Portland and in New York and
[03:23:42.020 --> 03:23:46.660]  other places when they see that they're no longer just ruling the street that the proud
[03:23:46.660 --> 03:23:51.300]  boys show up and and you know stomp them down they're going to take it to the next level
[03:23:51.300 --> 03:23:55.660]  they're not going to go back home no I agree you got like 15 guys in skinny jeans throwing
[03:23:55.660 --> 03:24:00.460]  bottles at proud boys five proud boys stomp them in the ground the police charge them they
[03:24:00.460 --> 03:24:04.340]  come to their event to wait for them they get their ass kicked and the police charge them
[03:24:04.340 --> 03:24:12.460]  right but the the the antifa types are going to go whether underground and you're just
[03:24:12.460 --> 03:24:16.500]  like the SPS when that wasn't working no I agree they're going to bomb the proud boys
[03:24:16.500 --> 03:24:21.260]  they're not going to find they're going to bomb them they're going to take it to the
[03:24:21.260 --> 03:24:27.860]  next level right and they'll probably use rifles to blame on the right that'll be the
[03:24:27.860 --> 03:24:35.940]  easiest trick to use but we'll have to see the NYPD is going to charge the proud boys
[03:24:35.940 --> 03:24:39.780]  when they admit they came to the place they were speaking they attacked them first so
[03:24:39.780 --> 03:24:46.900]  now if you kick on a silence ash you're to blame you have to figure this is always going
[03:24:46.900 --> 03:24:53.340]  to happen I saw a video coming out of England where at a rally the police you know with
[03:24:53.340 --> 03:24:59.980]  the bearded police and some kind of like auxiliary uniform looked like you know Al Qaeda and people
[03:24:59.980 --> 03:25:03.980]  are questioning him are you an Islamist so don't ever figure that the police are going
[03:25:03.980 --> 03:25:08.380]  to be on the side of freedom the police are on the side of the bureaucracy the elites
[03:25:08.380 --> 03:25:14.740]  and getting their pension and their paycheck so yeah don't look for help from the police
[03:25:14.740 --> 03:25:20.100]  if it if any help comes from the police it'll be off duty with either a tip a tip given to
[03:25:20.100 --> 03:25:25.340]  our side but you know out of demonstration consider the police part of Antifa because
[03:25:25.340 --> 03:25:29.500]  the mayor will order them to either stand down if it's a boy sitting inside we have
[03:25:29.500 --> 03:25:32.340]  the Soros documents and it sounds like I'm interrupting your sky's breaking up but it's
[03:25:32.340 --> 03:25:37.060]  still pretty good let's go to Kim in Arkansas you're on the air about violence to the left
[03:25:37.060 --> 03:25:44.580]  go ahead perfect topic yes I just wanted to make a couple comments on the ball into the
[03:25:44.580 --> 03:25:51.620]  left and the voter fraud that you're speaking about I believe that you know something very
[03:25:51.620 --> 03:25:58.260]  like the first caller from Texas is very evil present for clear and present danger and
[03:25:58.260 --> 03:26:04.820]  very nefarious people that are willing to you know do anything to go to any length and
[03:26:04.820 --> 03:26:11.420]  I feel like that you know it's kind of like Nick or for you to me when they're using dead
[03:26:11.420 --> 03:26:18.540]  people as a vote and if that's what we're you know battling and that's what our opponent
[03:26:18.540 --> 03:26:26.740]  is it does take you know the counter think that and the good news is there they got busted
[03:26:26.740 --> 03:26:31.660]  with thousands of fake votes and now they've been indicted so that's a strong Matt that's
[03:26:31.660 --> 03:26:36.620]  what's exciting though we're watching now aren't we Matt yeah and it's really important
[03:26:36.620 --> 03:26:42.620]  that if you're you know somebody who really wants to do something who's got guts you know
[03:26:42.620 --> 03:26:48.980]  that's not just a keyboard commando infiltrate here to be a volunteer to be a poll watcher
[03:26:48.980 --> 03:26:53.620]  this is this is like throwing you know holy water on the devil when a real Republican
[03:26:53.620 --> 03:26:59.740]  shows up to be a poll watcher and not a not a sellout stooge false Republican if there's
[03:26:59.740 --> 03:27:03.860]  a real poll watcher there until the you know ballots all go in the box and get put in the
[03:27:03.860 --> 03:27:08.660]  van you know and driven away by state officials then they can't do that they can't you know
[03:27:08.660 --> 03:27:13.100]  stop the boxes at the end and it's not just the dead people it's anybody that didn't show
[03:27:13.100 --> 03:27:17.860]  up will be voting you know at the after the poll closes so having poll watchers and every
[03:27:17.860 --> 03:27:23.860]  Democrat precinct is is really critical really important and listen we're not going to vote
[03:27:23.860 --> 03:27:27.460]  illegally we're not going to do that but go get your neighbors your friends that have
[03:27:27.460 --> 03:27:31.100]  been on the voting rolls haven't voted or go get grandma out of the nursing home and
[03:27:31.100 --> 03:27:35.300]  say hey do you like Ted Cruz or beat oh and and she you know and then take grandma down
[03:27:35.300 --> 03:27:41.620]  to vote that is so critical Matt but if you want to be a if you want to be a real superhero
[03:27:41.620 --> 03:27:47.900]  in the election world think about how you could stop 500 or 1000 false ballots from
[03:27:47.900 --> 03:27:54.300]  being cast that that's really the superhero cape right there volunteer to be a poll a
[03:27:54.300 --> 03:28:00.300]  precinct watcher in a Democrat precinct a poll watcher you know be a registered Republican
[03:28:00.300 --> 03:28:04.460]  then if some homeless dude comes in he say what's your name he goes my name's David well
[03:28:04.460 --> 03:28:10.740]  it says you're Bill Sanchez here oh they just gave me that exactly just questioning it if
[03:28:10.740 --> 03:28:15.700]  it doesn't match up beats it they just telling us rolling over right and when the when the
[03:28:15.700 --> 03:28:20.740]  vans roll in that are going from precinct to precinct you'll be there to say no way
[03:28:20.740 --> 03:28:24.700]  this isn't flying here they're gonna have to get back in the van and try somewhere else

[03:32:56.940 --> 03:33:15.620]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. My good buddy Shane Steiner sent me this piece
[03:33:15.620 --> 03:33:30.540]  here. You've got a 1-10-24th, basically a percentage of 1% Native American but this
[03:33:30.540 --> 03:33:43.740]  is that percentage of Navy SEAL. Everything they do turns to crap, Matt Bracken, because
[03:33:43.740 --> 03:33:48.940]  they think it's the old days of 20 years ago or even 10 years ago where they could lie
[03:33:48.940 --> 03:33:53.260]  and say something outrageous and we would buy it but now Trump says you're not a Native
[03:33:53.260 --> 03:34:00.820]  American and then it's a 10th generation maybe and they're not even sure and like the average
[03:34:00.820 --> 03:34:06.340]  person has way more than she does. People are like no, you're a fraud and then Pocahontas'
[03:34:06.340 --> 03:34:10.420]  direct descendants come out and say you're full of crap Warren and then the Cherokee
[03:34:10.420 --> 03:34:14.820]  that she says she's part of come out against her and it's just all the real Native Americans
[03:34:14.820 --> 03:34:20.820]  say this is ridiculous and again it just shows what frauds they are. It's like Beta, I'm
[03:34:20.820 --> 03:34:25.900]  sorry I miss his name, but Pito O'Rourke, is it Bevo O'Rourke, whatever his name is,
[03:34:25.900 --> 03:34:29.900]  he comes out and says my mom's been a Republican her whole life and then it turns back decades
[03:34:29.900 --> 03:34:34.740]  and decades. He's a Democrat. It's like don't they know the lying doesn't work anymore,
[03:34:34.740 --> 03:34:43.620]  I think his real name is Francis. He's trying to be a fake Hispanic. So he's trying to
[03:34:43.620 --> 03:34:48.220]  appropriate being a fake Hispanic, giving himself like a little bit of Hispanic flair
[03:34:48.220 --> 03:34:54.020]  to go against Ted Cruz. But this has been falling apart for the left. At least a great
[03:34:54.020 --> 03:35:00.180]  example is the whole Dan Rather memo gate thing. That would have absolutely worked
[03:35:00.180 --> 03:35:04.740]  ten years before it happened. It would have been unquestioned. The mainstream media would
[03:35:04.740 --> 03:35:10.700]  have produced that memo that Dan Rather National Guard memo and it would have been gospel.
[03:35:10.700 --> 03:35:16.780]  That kind of thing worked for Walter Cronkite right through the 90s. And when social media
[03:35:16.780 --> 03:35:22.540]  came along, suddenly there were these armies of online fact checkers and experts that could
[03:35:22.540 --> 03:35:27.860]  combine their little bits of information like about the proportional spacing and the not
[03:35:27.860 --> 03:35:33.100]  lack of Times New Roman back on that type of a typewriter that would have been used.
[03:35:33.100 --> 03:35:38.900]  So that led to the end of Dan Rather. And ever since then, their tricks have been failing
[03:35:38.900 --> 03:35:43.260]  more and more often. Now all their tricks are failing because once people have a voice,
[03:35:43.260 --> 03:35:48.460]  we can not only once people have a voice and once once they know they're being conned,
[03:35:48.460 --> 03:35:54.260]  they start looking. And not and not only that, but we can now use
[03:35:54.260 --> 03:36:01.300]  Alinsky tactics against them right inside the news cycle because we can make a mockery
[03:36:01.300 --> 03:36:08.740]  meme of the 1024th. They're terrific ones all over the place. NPCs, the 1024th. And so
[03:36:08.740 --> 03:36:13.660]  in the same time cycle that they thought that they were going to pull an October surprise
[03:36:13.660 --> 03:36:18.820]  it boomerangs back on them 10 times over. And so this is leading to very
[03:36:18.820 --> 03:36:24.340]  great frustration on their side is that we can question them in real time and they don't
[03:36:24.340 --> 03:36:27.180]  control the narrative. And they always assume that they would.
[03:36:27.180 --> 03:36:32.420]  And remember their power base, for example, is in academia, where they absolutely control
[03:36:32.420 --> 03:36:38.500]  the faculty lounge, you know, the politically correct witches and warlocks, they control
[03:36:38.500 --> 03:36:44.180]  the faculty lounge 100%. Then they come out into the real world and they get, you know,
[03:36:44.180 --> 03:36:48.940]  slapped right in the face. And they don't like it at all. You know, these guys are basically
[03:36:48.940 --> 03:36:53.580]  Bolsheviks. If they could, they would load us into boxcars, you know, and send us to
[03:36:53.580 --> 03:36:58.420]  reeducation camps, you know, at best. And by the way, it's not Larry Gwasswall
[03:36:58.420 --> 03:37:01.500]  telling us that 30 years ago now, they're all over the news saying they want to kill
[03:37:01.500 --> 03:37:05.300]  us. They want to enslave us. They want to take us over. I mean, I really think they're
[03:37:05.300 --> 03:37:10.740]  extincting themselves. If we can win this election in 2020, bring back the Republic,
[03:37:10.740 --> 03:37:15.580]  fix things. I think we've turned the corner on communism and globalism. Here's the problem.
[03:37:15.580 --> 03:37:19.700]  Then we face AI, then we face population, then we face, we got enough problems. I'm
[03:37:19.700 --> 03:37:24.060]  not saying we're some utopia over the next hill, but my God, man, I think we're so damn
[03:37:24.060 --> 03:37:28.700]  close. If people fully break with the, with the conditioning and the peer pressure and
[03:37:28.700 --> 03:37:31.740]  the bullying, I think we can save humanity.
[03:37:31.740 --> 03:37:36.300]  Politically, yes. I think so. We're seeing the pushback in Europe as well as with Trump
[03:37:36.300 --> 03:37:42.340]  and in the USA. However, there are things that are beyond any president's control.
[03:37:42.340 --> 03:37:49.060]  We could be going into a global economic recession that puts so much stress on societies that
[03:37:49.060 --> 03:37:55.540]  it leads to, you know, people so far out of work. And so knows that's happening. So they're
[03:37:55.540 --> 03:38:01.180]  trying to blast the migrant corridors already into Europe and the US to use that crisis
[03:38:01.180 --> 03:38:05.060]  for total domination. And I was going to start the show that today, but I did not get into
[03:38:05.060 --> 03:38:09.580]  the seasonstead. And that was the question. If they're able to cleanse the economy, which
[03:38:09.580 --> 03:38:13.940]  they're trying to do, which is insane, or if it just happens on its own, then what does
[03:38:13.940 --> 03:38:15.460]  Trump face?
[03:38:15.460 --> 03:38:21.140]  Right. Because the media will blame him 100% for any economic problems. But I think that
[03:38:21.140 --> 03:38:26.340]  socially, the, you know, the right in the middle, middle class of America is stronger
[03:38:26.340 --> 03:38:31.900]  and more confident than it's been in decades. So I think there's a certain amount of resilience
[03:38:31.900 --> 03:38:35.660]  that we wouldn't, you know, immediately go to blaming Trump. Of course, the left-wing
[03:38:35.660 --> 03:38:40.060]  media will. But I think that Americans will would understand that there's a, there are
[03:38:40.060 --> 03:38:43.060]  global consequences. There are global downturns.
[03:38:43.060 --> 03:38:47.140]  I think if they're able to cleanse the economy with Bill Maher saying, let's have a depression
[03:38:47.140 --> 03:38:50.620]  to teach these Trump people and all this stuff happening, I think it'll blow up in their
[03:38:50.620 --> 03:38:53.420]  face. People are going to get really pissed.
[03:38:53.420 --> 03:38:58.500]  Yeah. And I think that the timing of the left tricks that they're trying to use, like this
[03:38:58.500 --> 03:39:03.700]  caravan is probably going to result in, you know, in a few more percentage points for
[03:39:03.700 --> 03:39:09.540]  our side in this election. Flooding the zone with, you know, helpless, you know, refugees
[03:39:09.540 --> 03:39:14.340]  from Guatemala, when it obviously it's, you know, left-wingers paid by Soros that are
[03:39:14.340 --> 03:39:19.820]  funding the, and instigating the entire thing, I think it works to our benefit. Their tricks
[03:39:19.820 --> 03:39:24.940]  aren't working. All their tricks are boomeranging. And I think that they're giving up on the
[03:39:24.940 --> 03:39:25.940]  midterms.
[03:39:25.940 --> 03:39:29.980]  No, I agree. I agree. And they're going to pull something big probably after then, but
[03:39:29.980 --> 03:39:37.100]  who knows? Let's see. Who's up next here? Let's go ahead and talk to Ryan in West Virginia.
[03:39:37.100 --> 03:39:42.860]  Then we'll go to Chris and others. Ryan, you're worried about what's that? I want to ask Matt
[03:39:42.860 --> 03:39:47.620]  this too, this thing about, oh, Matt, he's a Democrat. Is that disinfo? What do you think
[03:39:47.620 --> 03:39:49.900]  that is, Ryan?
[03:39:49.900 --> 03:39:58.300]  I just wanted to get the name out. If Trump is going to get rid of Mattis, he should.
[03:39:58.300 --> 03:40:04.220]  There's this general from the Marine Corps. He's a fall van ripper. He's retired. And
[03:40:04.220 --> 03:40:10.860]  he's just, he's the most badass general that we've had in a long time. And if they could
[03:40:10.860 --> 03:40:16.220]  get him in, that'd be great. Because Mattis, I lost all respect for him once he decided
[03:40:16.220 --> 03:40:21.420]  to go against Trump on the whole transgender because I was a combat medic and mentally
[03:40:21.420 --> 03:40:24.140]  ill people should not be in the military.
[03:40:24.140 --> 03:40:29.780]  Oh, I mean, Hungary's banning it. It's meant to destroy society. Absolutely. What do you
[03:40:29.780 --> 03:40:34.380]  make of Trump saying Mattis may be gone soon? He's basically a Democrat.
[03:40:34.380 --> 03:40:40.060]  I hope he is. And I hope he puts someone in better. But like, that just wasn't terrible.
[03:40:40.060 --> 03:40:41.060]  He's definitely.
[03:40:41.060 --> 03:40:44.620]  No, I hear you. I appreciate your call, Ryan. Thanks for holding. What do you think's going
[03:40:44.620 --> 03:40:46.300]  on, Matt Braggum?
[03:40:46.300 --> 03:40:53.140]  Well, I agree that it's been a show of weakness by the generals on the things like, you know,
[03:40:53.140 --> 03:40:58.580]  the transgenders in the military. That's just practically designed to destroy unit cohesion
[03:40:58.580 --> 03:40:59.580]  and discipline.
[03:40:59.580 --> 03:41:03.580]  Well, they're bringing in the robot, take over the military. It's designed to spike
[03:41:03.580 --> 03:41:04.580]  the military.
[03:41:04.580 --> 03:41:11.900]  But on the other hand, you know, Mattis absolutely annihilated 400 Russian mercenaries, the group
[03:41:11.900 --> 03:41:16.580]  Wagner in Syria. And that, that put people on notice that, you know, there are lines
[03:41:16.580 --> 03:41:20.860]  that we can, we can bring the hammer down from heaven and we'll, and we'll do it.
[03:41:20.860 --> 03:41:24.380]  So I'm asking you, what do you think? Then is it some disenfocus? Trump doesn't really
[03:41:24.380 --> 03:41:28.300]  do that a lot. He doesn't. He just plays him straight. Why would he say, Oh, Mattis may
[03:41:28.300 --> 03:41:30.340]  be gone soon. He's basically a Democrat.
[03:41:30.340 --> 03:41:34.980]  Well, I think that I think that what Trump has been saying is that he doesn't really
[03:41:34.980 --> 03:41:39.140]  feel that he's getting complete loyalty from all of his team. Remember when he came in,
[03:41:39.140 --> 03:41:44.420]  he was a political novice and he took a lot of suggestions like Rod Rosenstein. Oh, yeah,
[03:41:44.420 --> 03:41:49.540]  there's the perfect guy. And Rod Rosenstein behind sessions was a complete setup. You
[03:41:49.540 --> 03:41:53.260]  know, that might as well have been putting Mueller and Rosenstein and Comey completely
[03:41:53.260 --> 03:41:58.140]  in charge. So, so now that he's going to be stronger after the midterms, I think he'll
[03:41:58.140 --> 03:42:01.300]  be stronger if we win, then he's going to be able to move out.
[03:42:01.300 --> 03:42:02.300]  I agree.
[03:42:02.300 --> 03:42:05.340]  Trump's stronger than ever. We're going to come back, final segment, get your final point
[03:42:05.340 --> 03:42:09.540]  to take a few more calls straight ahead with Matt Bracken of enemies far and domestic.com.
[03:42:09.540 --> 03:42:16.340]  And then Owen Schreuer and others are loaded for bear with the war room. And then eight
[03:42:16.340 --> 03:42:20.540]  to 10 p.m. every night, we now do coverage of the election the next 20 nights and then
[03:42:20.540 --> 03:42:25.500]  right through the week after the election. And then I'm going to announce a new show
[03:42:25.500 --> 03:42:28.900]  seven to midnight. I'm even sure he's going to do it yet. If it's me, Matt Bracken, we
[03:42:28.900 --> 03:42:32.860]  got to talk to him because I'm so busy. I'm like a one-legged man and asking a contest.
[03:42:32.860 --> 03:42:35.940]  We're going to line up a big round table show every night. It's going to be hotter than
[03:42:35.940 --> 03:42:40.580]  the pistol, seven to 10 p.m. central. That's coming up. But tonight, eight o'clock central
[03:42:40.580 --> 03:42:46.740]  election coverage when YouTube was down last night with Pito O'Rourke, I mean, I'm sorry,

[03:46:57.980 --> 03:47:04.980]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:27.980 --> 03:47:33.740]  Peter O'Rourke criticizing Ted Cruz for supporting a judicial nominee that doesn't want to teach
[03:47:33.740 --> 03:47:37.540]  three-year-old boys. They're little girls. Here it is.
[03:47:37.540 --> 03:47:41.860]  He supported the nomination of a judge, Jeff Matier, who described transgender children
[03:47:41.860 --> 03:47:47.200]  as part of Satan's plan, believes in conversion therapy. He supported the nomination of a
[03:47:47.200 --> 03:47:52.500]  judge, someone to be a judge, who'd never tried a case before. Another potential judge
[03:47:52.500 --> 03:47:57.300]  who could not tell us whether Brown versus the Board of Education was correctly decided.
[03:47:57.300 --> 03:48:01.340]  From our perspective, in a state where you can be fired for being gay, I want justice
[03:48:01.340 --> 03:48:05.860]  who believes in civil rights. From the perspective of a state that ranks 50th in voter turnout
[03:48:05.860 --> 03:48:10.100]  in the country, not by accident, by design, some people drawn out of their democracy,
[03:48:10.100 --> 03:48:12.860]  I want a justice who believes in voting rights.
[03:48:12.860 --> 03:48:19.540]  Well, more... Trump's judicial pick calls trans children Satan's plan. No. The actual
[03:48:19.540 --> 03:48:22.860]  thing is, teaching three-year-olds to have hormone therapy and have their genitals cut
[03:48:22.860 --> 03:48:28.260]  off is Satan's plan I've ever heard it. I mean, a pedo just rapes a kid. A leftist,
[03:48:28.260 --> 03:48:32.340]  a Democrat, wants to kill them in the womb if they can't, want to cut their genitals
[03:48:32.340 --> 03:48:38.260]  off. I guess that's why they love the Islamics so much. So it's truly, truly sickening. I
[03:48:38.260 --> 03:48:42.980]  wanted to point out why I'm calling pedo a roar. But I guess it's just abort the children,
[03:48:42.980 --> 03:48:49.300]  kill the children. How about child murder or support, supporter a roar? I want to hit
[03:48:49.300 --> 03:48:54.300]  a few more calls with Matt Bracken, former Navy Shield best-selling author, great analyst
[03:48:54.300 --> 03:48:58.740]  here before we end this hour and start with the war room here in a second. But what do
[03:48:58.740 --> 03:49:05.420]  you make of this targeting of children, which they admit is a population reduction program,
[03:49:05.420 --> 03:49:09.620]  since the left can't convince everybody to join all their weird sexual activities, they're
[03:49:09.620 --> 03:49:14.420]  just bullying our children. And the name of openness and liberalism, we allow them to
[03:49:14.420 --> 03:49:17.260]  engage in the raping of the children's brains.
[03:49:17.260 --> 03:49:26.220]  Well, I think that it's pure evil to basically sow these ideas into children's minds. Children
[03:49:26.220 --> 03:49:30.620]  are confused enough. I mean, some three-year-olds go through a stage where they think that they're
[03:49:30.620 --> 03:49:35.460]  a puppy dog. I mean, to actually put into their mind that you're not really a boy or
[03:49:35.460 --> 03:49:41.780]  a girl, you're the opposite. And to counter-dress them, I think that it's very sick and evil.
[03:49:41.780 --> 03:49:47.580]  I've seen them dressed up as little drag queens and taken to pride parades. I think
[03:49:47.580 --> 03:49:51.820]  that it's extremely sick and evil. And when you take a child and you twist their mind
[03:49:51.820 --> 03:49:58.540]  this way, then you have them put on hormones, hormone blockers, pre-puberty, you're basically
[03:49:58.540 --> 03:50:05.700]  sterilizing them. You're wrecking their physiology. You can't undo this damage. I think it's incredibly
[03:50:05.700 --> 03:50:06.700]  evil.
[03:50:06.700 --> 03:50:11.180]  And I think that if our society recovers from this, it'll look back on this period as a
[03:50:11.180 --> 03:50:16.220]  very, very dark, twisted, evil period. You know, similar to the period when people were
[03:50:16.220 --> 03:50:19.700]  lobotomized wholesale and electroshocked.
[03:50:19.700 --> 03:50:22.620]  Our blacks were injected with syphilis.
[03:50:22.620 --> 03:50:29.300]  A very evil, dark experiment, a time of great evil. And it's intended to wreck the society,
[03:50:29.300 --> 03:50:30.300]  I believe.
[03:50:30.300 --> 03:50:31.300]  Transgenderism.
[03:50:31.300 --> 03:50:36.300]  Transgenderism. A time of great evil. I absolutely meant Bracken on target. Briefly, I'm going
[03:50:36.300 --> 03:50:40.500]  to take a few calls. Look, I don't defend Saudi Arabia. We're big critics of it, but
[03:50:40.500 --> 03:50:43.820]  it's saying it's going to stop funding Al Qaeda and ISIS. It's doing all the right
[03:50:43.820 --> 03:50:48.500]  things so far. And then magically, this guy's killed in plain view. It's all recorded. And
[03:50:48.500 --> 03:50:52.460]  then my sources start saying, no, it's a false flag, just like Trump doesn't control his
[03:50:52.460 --> 03:50:54.020]  whole intelligence apparatus.
[03:50:54.020 --> 03:50:58.380]  And the whole media jumps on it and says, Trump and Saudi Arabia are guilty. And now
[03:50:58.380 --> 03:51:02.780]  they're just, that makes me suspicious of what this really is. And then the Crown Prince
[03:51:02.780 --> 03:51:06.380]  comes out and says, it's a rogue group within my intelligence, but I didn't authorize it.
[03:51:06.380 --> 03:51:10.340]  Well, why would you authorize cutting somebody up in plain view? And I'm not defending
[03:51:10.340 --> 03:51:13.420]  Saudi Arabia, Matt. I just, something smells here.
[03:51:13.420 --> 03:51:18.420]  Yeah, I think that there's a, there's a deep state civil war going on within Saudi Arabia
[03:51:18.420 --> 03:51:24.700]  just as much as here. You know, there are, there are very traditional Islamist power
[03:51:24.700 --> 03:51:30.660]  bases in Saudi Arabia that consider the Crown Prince to be too much of a modernizer. You
[03:51:30.660 --> 03:51:34.660]  know, that he's, that he's, he's loosening up the morals of society.
[03:51:34.660 --> 03:51:37.700]  And they want to mess up the Iran sanctions that are coming.
[03:51:37.700 --> 03:51:42.700]  Yeah. And I'm, and I'm no fan of Saudi Arabia. I personally, I think that the whole idea
[03:51:42.700 --> 03:51:48.420]  of playing real politic, you know, is a big mistake because, you know, even in World War
[03:51:48.420 --> 03:51:54.140]  I, the whole Lawrence of Arabia thing, that was the British, just to gain some points
[03:51:54.140 --> 03:52:00.420]  against the Turkish Empire, which was collapsing anyway, they built up Wahhabism in Saudi Arabia.
[03:52:00.420 --> 03:52:06.540]  That whole Lawrence of Arabia era was when Britain backed these, these crazy Wahhabists.
[03:52:06.540 --> 03:52:08.420]  Look what it's led to for the next century.
[03:52:08.420 --> 03:52:13.220]  No, I agree. Trump's trying to stabilize things, but you can't build castles with sand that
[03:52:13.220 --> 03:52:17.220]  stand up. It's a very dangerous game, but the left's trying to sabotage it to mess
[03:52:17.220 --> 03:52:23.540]  up his Iran deal. And so it's, it's, it's, it's out of control. Let's talk to Scott
[03:52:23.540 --> 03:52:28.940]  and P.A.'s got a great point, release the FISA warrants, the fake documents, release
[03:52:28.940 --> 03:52:32.980]  the deep state stuff before the election, because Mueller, well, Matt answered this
[03:52:32.980 --> 03:52:36.540]  first. Mueller and all them are acting like they're about to give up. I think they may
[03:52:36.540 --> 03:52:39.820]  be playing possum, Matt Bracken, quick response.
[03:52:39.820 --> 03:52:43.180]  I think that they're just bluffing before the midterms. They don't have anything. If
[03:52:43.180 --> 03:52:47.340]  they had anything, it would have been linked to the Washington Post and the New York Times,
[03:52:47.340 --> 03:52:50.820]  you know, the day after they had it. So I think that they're just bluffing. And I think
[03:52:50.820 --> 03:52:52.620]  that if Trump did it, it would, it would work.
[03:52:52.620 --> 03:52:55.820]  No, no, I agree, but they're acting like they know that's true. They're going to roll over.
[03:52:55.820 --> 03:52:59.940]  Rosenstein's signaled that. Mueller's signaling that. I think they're playing possum will
[03:52:59.940 --> 03:53:02.700]  bring something fake out.
[03:53:02.700 --> 03:53:06.900]  I don't know. I think that they're petrified. Glenn Simpson is looking at prison time. McCabe
[03:53:06.900 --> 03:53:11.740]  is looking at prison time. They're all going to start pointing upwards and saying, I thought
[03:53:11.740 --> 03:53:13.220]  I was just following orders.
[03:53:13.220 --> 03:53:19.580]  No, I agree. And so Mueller signifying to Rosenstein that the probe is about to be wrapped up. I
[03:53:19.580 --> 03:53:21.580]  think that is a big victory.
[03:53:21.580 --> 03:53:27.020]  Yeah, they're all trying to unwind this and defuse this bomb with the least of them going
[03:53:27.020 --> 03:53:28.020]  to prison for the.
[03:53:28.020 --> 03:53:32.500]  But as soon as he threatened to release the document, they did that. If he holds back,
[03:53:32.500 --> 03:53:36.540]  they may double track back. I think he hits them because they're dishonorable. They're
[03:53:36.540 --> 03:53:40.260]  just going to hit him with everything.
[03:53:40.260 --> 03:53:44.660]  It's a poker game where you want to hold your best cards for the very last. You want to
[03:53:44.660 --> 03:53:50.220]  see your adversary. You want to see his best hand and then finally slam down your cards
[03:53:50.220 --> 03:53:51.340]  on top of his.
[03:53:51.340 --> 03:53:55.860]  So everybody's just playing a waiting game to see who's got the, you know, when, when
[03:53:55.860 --> 03:54:01.260]  Mueller plays his last cards, that's when Trump will play his final cards. Trump doesn't
[03:54:01.260 --> 03:54:05.540]  want to go off before the midterms, because the media will make it look like he's trying
[03:54:05.540 --> 03:54:09.100]  to sabotage Mueller, even though Mueller's got nothing. It's a pure bluff.
[03:54:09.100 --> 03:54:12.940]  No, I agree with you. Scott, go ahead. What do you think President Trump should do?
[03:54:12.940 --> 03:54:17.540]  Well, first, I just want to tell you, I'm sitting here wearing my, we stand with Trump
[03:54:17.540 --> 03:54:22.980]  infowars shirt. I'm wearing it and everybody gives me compliments on it. I wear it around
[03:54:22.980 --> 03:54:30.540]  town all the time. And I think it's important that, you know, we show, we show our colors.
[03:54:30.540 --> 03:54:36.420]  But as far as the FISA goes, I think, you know, I don't know. That's why I wanted to
[03:54:36.420 --> 03:54:44.460]  ask you about that. But bottom line is, I think Trump, no matter what the Dems do, Trump
[03:54:44.460 --> 03:54:46.940]  still wins. What do you think?
[03:54:46.940 --> 03:54:51.020]  Well, I know, I agree with Matt. The best cars usually hold till last, but like super
[03:54:51.020 --> 03:54:55.660]  villains are typally always brag and wait too long. If you have the torpedo that blows
[03:54:55.660 --> 03:55:00.420]  the enemy up, I just say release it now and hammer their ass to make sure we win the midterms.
[03:55:00.420 --> 03:55:04.060]  I think release it all now. I don't want to just scare the hell out of them and watch
[03:55:04.060 --> 03:55:06.260]  them roll over. Matt?
[03:55:06.260 --> 03:55:11.580]  I totally agree. Like the super villain analogy is perfect. You know, they always give the
[03:55:11.580 --> 03:55:16.300]  guy the one more chance while the laser is crawling up the table towards his private
[03:55:16.300 --> 03:55:20.940]  parts. You know, do it when you've got the guy tied to the table. Do it right now. Don't
[03:55:20.940 --> 03:55:24.780]  give them a chance to get away. Fire that torpedo. I agree.
[03:55:24.780 --> 03:55:25.780]  Scott?
[03:55:25.780 --> 03:55:33.140]  Let's change Warren's name from Pocahontas to Tonto, which means foolish.
[03:55:33.140 --> 03:55:37.540]  There's a great guy named Tonto, so we don't want to do that. But no, I absolutely hear
[03:55:37.540 --> 03:55:43.860]  what you're saying. And it's just crazy what a fraud she is. I mean, just on my dad's side,
[03:55:43.860 --> 03:55:47.300]  through his dad's, I'm 6%. I'll call myself an American. I'm proud of it. I'm proud of
[03:55:47.300 --> 03:55:51.420]  it. It makes me stronger. Good folks. But then all the rest of my family, especially
[03:55:51.420 --> 03:55:56.140]  just, you know, but I don't call myself an American. This woman has not even one tenth
[03:55:56.140 --> 03:56:01.940]  of one percent. She is a galactic fraud. Thank you, Scott. Man, all the callers that held.
[03:56:01.940 --> 03:56:05.940]  I know some of you two hours. That's because we can take 100 calls at once. I apologize,
