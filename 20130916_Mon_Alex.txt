[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:31.760]  Texas Alex Jones four killed eight injured there were three shooters now
[00:31.760 --> 00:40.640]  we're told there's two at the big naval yard in Washington DC where no one is
[00:40.640 --> 00:45.600]  allowed to have firearms to protect themselves noticed almost all of these
[00:45.600 --> 00:51.000]  mass shootings happen in victim disarmament zones now my gut will tell
[00:51.000 --> 00:56.720]  me this will probably end up being a couple of quote jihadis but even if
[00:56.720 --> 01:01.000]  they are jihadis they will somehow go through their home computers and if they
[01:01.000 --> 01:08.600]  find them visiting ABC CBS NBC Fox News that won't be on the news if they get
[01:08.600 --> 01:12.120]  into their computers or their iPhones or whatever they're reportedly both been
[01:12.120 --> 01:19.680]  shot and killed but who knows the stories are changing by the minute today
[01:19.680 --> 01:24.240]  we'll be able to flesh a lot of this out but you better believe that even if
[01:24.240 --> 01:30.880]  they're just pure jihadis that did this even connected to al-qaeda groups out of
[01:30.880 --> 01:38.000]  the Middle East being commanded by the leader of al-qaeda last Friday to attack
[01:38.000 --> 01:42.360]  the United States remember that the very same group our government's arming even
[01:42.360 --> 01:48.680]  if that's the case you can believe like the last three or four cases they're
[01:48.680 --> 01:54.760]  going to try to connect it to info wars.com and yours truly part of that
[01:54.760 --> 02:00.480]  long-term demonization campaign if you want to wonder how big this radio show
[02:00.480 --> 02:05.440]  is even separate from the website it's the fact that they try to pin a
[02:05.440 --> 02:12.160]  little bit more on the news. I'd say about half the major crimes we get brought
[02:12.160 --> 02:16.880]  into it you had Poplowski shoot three cops in Pittsburgh a few years ago the
[02:16.880 --> 02:20.600]  Marine and they said he did it because he was one of my listeners turned out he
[02:20.600 --> 02:24.000]  hated me he was a white supremacist that didn't like the fact that I wasn't a
[02:24.000 --> 02:28.440]  racist within two hours of him being in custody his mother was trying to throw him
[02:28.440 --> 02:33.880]  out of the house is why he shot the cops he was drunk they were blaming me on the
[02:33.880 --> 02:40.800]  news for it nationally now why is that it's because we've got their number we
[02:40.800 --> 02:44.400]  know who the globalist are we know what their program is and they're very
[02:44.400 --> 02:49.120]  concerned that we be discredited so that people will not look at what we cover
[02:49.120 --> 02:54.320]  on the radio show the info wars nightly news and on the websites which by the
[02:54.320 --> 02:59.480]  way we're working on revamping to the latest easiest web design that's all
[02:59.480 --> 03:07.600]  ongoing right now so prison planet dot com info wars dot com four killed eight
[03:07.600 --> 03:14.520]  injured washed in post others were saying three shooters now to AP saying at
[03:14.520 --> 03:22.400]  least one shooter is dead and now CNN's reporting two suspects down one dead one
[03:22.400 --> 03:28.800]  down I would suspect that means dead or close to it in the naval yard shooting
[03:28.800 --> 03:34.080]  oh but don't worry the same team that responded to the Boston bombing because
[03:34.080 --> 03:38.080]  that undoubtedly was a false flag up one side and down the other they are there
[03:38.080 --> 03:43.280]  to make sure the truth comes out now the Russians have staged mass shootings
[03:43.280 --> 03:48.920]  before to take liberty clear evidence and pristine in other areas the Nazi
[03:48.920 --> 03:52.960]  stage mass shootings and Operation Himmler as a pretext to take liberties
[03:52.960 --> 03:57.920]  operation north woods put out by the Pentagon was how to stage mass shootings
[03:57.920 --> 04:04.280]  and frame it up on patsy's when you have multiple shooters like this it has
[04:04.280 --> 04:08.920]  patsy written all over it and how they tend to do it is in the modern age is
[04:08.920 --> 04:15.640]  have a drill have people that show up for the drill you then shoot them in the
[04:15.640 --> 04:21.400]  corridors or wherever you tell them to meet the the the the feds for the drill
[04:21.400 --> 04:27.120]  they shoot them then the feds go out with a mask or the contractors shoot some
[04:27.120 --> 04:33.120]  people folks said they were bad shots well that they were probably just told
[04:33.120 --> 04:37.440]  only kill a few people but great a big ruckus this is how you would stage a
[04:37.440 --> 04:41.560]  false flag and then you go back and are part of the FBI team they were said
[04:41.560 --> 04:45.520]  responded minutes after really but it took three hours for this to start
[04:45.520 --> 04:50.400]  winding down it started at what 720 Eastern it's just now starting to wind

[08:36.200 --> 08:41.880]  obviously we are going to be breaking down the navel yard shooting that's
[08:41.880 --> 08:49.560]  reportedly killed four injured eight including two police officers that are
[08:49.560 --> 08:57.960]  amongst the injured it looks like one of them is probably a fatality and both
[08:57.960 --> 09:03.280]  shooters are reportedly down one of them reportedly dead we don't know if that's
[09:03.280 --> 09:09.960]  part of the list of killed reportedly the shooters were firing from balconies
[09:09.960 --> 09:14.400]  down into a cafeteria area and we have one of the witnesses we're going to play
[09:14.400 --> 09:22.320]  a clip of in a moment saying that she was told by cafeteria staff to stay there
[09:22.320 --> 09:25.800]  you know you're supposed to get in a fetal position your children are trained
[09:25.800 --> 09:30.560]  anybody ever comes up into an area shooting people you don't run you get
[09:30.560 --> 09:35.160]  in a fetal position to get the maximum kill rate so that the government can
[09:35.160 --> 09:39.400]  then take everybody's guns you're trained to not fight back when a bully punches
[09:39.400 --> 09:45.520]  you you're trained to never resist you're trained by the criminal state to
[09:45.520 --> 09:51.840]  submit and be a victim and no one can doubt that that is the case
[09:51.840 --> 10:19.400]  back let's play a clip of that from one of the press conferences that's right
[10:19.400 --> 10:30.160]  and they told they told the 3,000 people there reportedly over loudspeakers to
[10:30.160 --> 10:37.400]  shelter in place and of course we're doing another article on what came out
[10:37.400 --> 10:40.640]  earlier in the year the Homeland Security training video where it tells
[10:40.640 --> 10:50.160]  you to shelter in place and fight back with scissors or your shoe but all over
[10:50.160 --> 10:54.960]  the country for at least 15 years as you know they have training in government
[10:54.960 --> 10:58.880]  facilities corporations but but mainly government training centers and
[10:58.880 --> 11:05.800]  government indoctrination centers public education centers that you you get
[11:05.800 --> 11:10.840]  down on your knees or in a fetal position so that I guess it's easier for
[11:10.840 --> 11:21.040]  the shooter to kill everybody that'd be like training someone that if you're
[11:22.040 --> 11:27.200]  walking down the street and somebody tells you to get in a car just go ahead
[11:27.200 --> 11:33.440]  and go get in the car with them because then everything is going to be all right
[11:33.440 --> 11:41.280]  totally disgusting to see all of this unfolding I just wanted to remind
[11:41.280 --> 11:45.480]  everybody here today that you have a better chance to die from a honeybee
[11:45.480 --> 11:54.440]  sting than to be killed in a terror attack period including mass shootings
[11:54.440 --> 12:00.480]  there's only about 64 of them a year and less than 25 of them are actual real
[12:00.480 --> 12:04.480]  mass shooting events that was the statistics from the Justice Department
[12:04.480 --> 12:11.120]  indexed over the last decade that we've covered at nauseam and since 1992 through
[12:11.120 --> 12:18.160]  2011 where we get the latest statistics here's the LA Times mirroring what we
[12:18.160 --> 12:22.920]  reported months before and my point is we forced these statistics out we
[12:22.920 --> 12:27.000]  actually broke them down here that overall mass shootings the last 20 years
[12:27.000 --> 12:33.680]  have dropped 49 percent total shootings have dropped 49 percent mass shootings
[12:33.680 --> 12:38.400]  it was 60 something percent and overall crime more than 50 percent and here's
[12:38.400 --> 12:43.840]  the LA Times this year breaking that down gun crime has plunged but Americans
[12:43.840 --> 12:50.200]  think it's up study says that is out of the Los Angeles Times and tonight on the
[12:50.200 --> 12:53.560]  nightly news I'm going to be co-hosting it we're going to go over all those
[12:53.560 --> 12:58.200]  statistics we'll cover some of them here today as well but don't take my word for
[12:58.200 --> 13:06.760]  it but the perception everywhere is that crime is absolutely exploding and why is
[13:06.760 --> 13:13.240]  that you had one 19 year old man hiding out in a boat in Boston and they shut
[13:13.240 --> 13:17.080]  more than half the city down and treated everyone as suspects who look
[13:17.080 --> 13:22.120]  nothing like him and went in people's houses and beat people up in a giant
[13:22.120 --> 13:30.080]  orgy of power-grabbing and it's the same thing here scores of helicopters
[13:30.080 --> 13:35.160]  dozens of armored vehicles it started at 7 20 in the morning and just started
[13:35.160 --> 13:46.840]  wrapping up about 15 minutes ago both shooters down at about 11 58 Eastern 10
[13:46.840 --> 13:54.400]  58 central just about 15 16 minutes ago they said okay this is kind of wrapping
[13:54.400 --> 13:59.040]  it up still people are told to shelter in place which means sit and wait and
[13:59.040 --> 14:01.600]  prepare to die
[14:01.840 --> 14:07.920]  unbelievable unbelievable that all of this is going on and and and and you see
[14:07.920 --> 14:13.520]  how good I guess security guards with guns are when there's just a few of them
[14:13.520 --> 14:17.480]  instead of everybody being armed one of the shooters reportedly walked up and
[14:17.480 --> 14:23.920]  shot a cop at point blank range was the first person shot now none of this is
[14:23.920 --> 14:27.720]  completely confirmed yet obviously it's all a fluid situation right now here's
[14:27.720 --> 14:34.360]  what I want to do there were reportedly 3,000 people in the Naval yard alone when
[14:34.360 --> 14:37.680]  they've had other mass shootings at universities that were ongoing we've been
[14:37.680 --> 14:41.640]  able to have callers in first to tell us what was happening but now that this
[14:41.640 --> 14:46.080]  situation is over or at least looks like it's ending I would like to hear from
[14:46.080 --> 14:52.520]  eyewitnesses to what you personally saw or heard at the Naval yard there in
[14:52.520 --> 15:00.320]  Washington DC in the victim disarmament zone crime capital twin crime capital of
[15:00.320 --> 15:08.280]  the world not just the United States DC and Chicago are well known to be the
[15:08.280 --> 15:15.320]  twin crime capitals of the planet worse than Mexico City per capita now now
[15:15.320 --> 15:19.560]  Mexico has the highest crime rate in the world overall and of course citizens
[15:19.560 --> 15:24.320]  aren't allowed to have guns periods only criminals in government same thing to
[15:24.320 --> 15:31.800]  peas in a pod have them but but but for cities Chicago the great city the
[15:31.800 --> 15:42.880]  wendy city and DC both have the twin twin peaks the the one has the record one
[15:42.880 --> 15:49.800]  year the other has the record the next year and that's it and so again a place
[15:49.800 --> 15:55.280]  where you've got all of these navy personnel and civilian personnel and
[15:55.280 --> 16:06.200]  and Longshoremen and the different you know civilian
[16:06.200 --> 16:13.400]  maritime groups merchant marine that make up so much of the military's transport
[16:13.400 --> 16:17.760]  fleet you've got them all there none of them allowed to have guns except a few
[16:17.760 --> 16:23.120]  federal security guards police officers they call them security guards in there
[16:23.120 --> 16:29.840]  to be shot when I guarantee you if you tried this let's say in a neighborhood
[16:29.840 --> 16:36.600]  in south Austin not even in particularly libertarian or conservative city if you
[16:36.600 --> 16:39.440]  had a mass shooter going on the street shooting people he would be dead in
[16:39.440 --> 16:43.960]  minutes and it happens all the time you've got somebody pulls a gun out for
[16:43.960 --> 16:49.280]  shooting people and folks kill them every month I see articles in Arizona or
[16:49.280 --> 16:53.720]  Texas or other states that have a lot of guns where people are shooting at cops
[16:53.720 --> 16:59.920]  in a standoff situation and citizens shoot the bad guys from behind you'll
[16:59.920 --> 17:03.720]  have a bad guy behind a tree or behind a truck shooting at cops you got cops over
[17:03.720 --> 17:08.600]  here shooting citizens just open their window boom on shot you're dead I mean
[17:08.600 --> 17:12.760]  it happens all the time it's in the local news and then you'll hear headlines
[17:12.760 --> 17:19.880]  like grand jury does not indict citizen hero and the police will have to go to
[17:19.880 --> 17:23.880]  the prosecutors and say oh don't no no no I know they were involved in the
[17:23.880 --> 17:28.080]  shooting but they they helped us please don't nowadays they would have arrested
[17:28.080 --> 17:36.840]  the citizen the janitor who went up the tower the UT tower with the Austin cop
[17:36.840 --> 17:40.800]  who I've interviewed and by the way the citizen got the first shot off with a
[17:40.800 --> 17:47.840]  shotgun charged him first and and and killed the Marine with the rifles
[17:47.840 --> 17:51.840]  nowadays they probably would have a I'm not kidding they would probably have
[17:51.840 --> 17:57.240]  arrested the the civilian as they call them or the cop wouldn't have let a
[17:57.240 --> 18:01.720]  civilian go up the tower with him because that's a that's an American that's
[18:01.720 --> 18:07.240]  an enemy that's a that's a fellow slave disarmed and and it's not that cops
[18:07.240 --> 18:11.720]  themselves are bad on average it's the training now is that a citizen with a
[18:11.720 --> 18:21.200]  gun is the ultimate evil when in truth ladies and gentlemen the truth is more
[18:21.200 --> 18:30.640]  guns means less crime and there is a 50 plus percent overall drop in shootings
[18:30.640 --> 18:36.280]  period 49% drop in other types of shootings and 60 plus percent overall
[18:36.280 --> 18:40.120]  drop in violent crime and and you can go look at those statistics one by one in
[18:40.120 --> 18:43.560]  the info wars dot com articles and videos we've done that I'm gonna have
[18:43.560 --> 18:48.880]  from earlier this year and last year with Sandy Hook reposted to an article
[18:48.880 --> 18:53.360]  at info wars dot com but you could just type in gun crime has plunged but
[18:53.360 --> 19:03.280]  Americans think it's up study says and they go in to say that actually some
[19:03.280 --> 19:10.680]  gun crime dropped 75% is what the LA Times says again it depends on how you
[19:10.680 --> 19:17.040]  look at it we try to be conservative okay but the whole point here is it's a
[19:17.040 --> 19:24.120]  75 right there but really it's it's 49 if you want to be most conservative it's
[19:24.120 --> 19:32.400]  49 sure some of it's as high as 75 so there you go now that's the big issue

[23:17.880 --> 23:22.480]  set my fake TV near a window and know the passing motors and pedestrians will

[24:17.880 --> 24:33.120]  I would like to hear from listeners that may have been inside of the giant
[24:33.120 --> 24:40.520]  complex and able guard yard that one building had as many as 3000 workers in
[24:40.520 --> 24:48.360]  it huge shipyard facility just a few miles away from the occupied capital
[24:48.360 --> 24:54.240]  there in DC they're reporting the the the main shooter suspect shot and being
[24:54.240 --> 25:00.960]  down being a reportedly a black man and then reportedly a Caucasian a white
[25:00.960 --> 25:05.960]  male in some type of khaki uniform with a khaki beret that sounds like some kind
[25:05.960 --> 25:11.160]  of US military uniform running around with a handgun but you can have a lot
[25:11.160 --> 25:15.560]  of false reports too because if any other citizen see someone with a gun
[25:15.560 --> 25:20.120]  you're not supposed to have a gun unless you're in a black uniform slaves aren't
[25:20.120 --> 25:25.800]  allowed to have guns so everyone's been Pavlovianly trained that you only see
[25:25.800 --> 25:30.200]  men in black uniforms black ski mask checkpoints that makes you feel safe
[25:30.200 --> 25:36.360]  like Nazi Germany that keeps you safe if somebody in the military happened to
[25:36.360 --> 25:39.920]  sneak a gun on the base which is not uncommon to be able to protect
[25:39.920 --> 25:45.920]  themselves then that would be accounting for the other shooters or it may be
[25:45.920 --> 25:50.680]  another shooter or it may have been somebody taking part in a drill and the
[25:50.680 --> 25:53.960]  way you'd run a false flag we don't know if this is a false flag the way you run
[25:53.960 --> 26:00.960]  a false flag one way you do it is to have shooters there who think they're part
[26:00.960 --> 26:05.040]  of a drill then you kill them and then have your real shooters just basically
[26:05.040 --> 26:10.880]  change out of whatever outfit they were in and then into another and then you
[26:10.880 --> 26:15.800]  divert everyone from the implosion of the narrative on Syria the implosion
[26:15.800 --> 26:20.120]  with the Benghazi report coming out the all the NSA news pouring out of the
[26:20.120 --> 26:25.200]  illegal spying and government lying the IRS caught lying about targeting tea
[26:25.200 --> 26:29.880]  party conservatives and others you've got all the other scandals so this is a
[26:29.880 --> 26:33.680]  great way to change the subject because any way you slice this ladies and
[26:33.680 --> 26:39.840]  gentlemen any way you look at this when you have one of these mass shootings
[26:39.840 --> 26:48.200]  it's like the world has ended we had six people burned up today in a trailer
[26:48.200 --> 26:55.320]  while the mom was at work associated press we have 1200 missing there could
[26:55.320 --> 27:00.040]  be hundreds of dead in Colorado you wouldn't even think that mattered maybe
[27:00.040 --> 27:04.920]  we should have a TSA checkpoint to stop the water or TSA could feel up the water
[27:04.920 --> 27:09.160]  to make sure bin Laden didn't hiding in it because bin Laden could be swimming
[27:09.160 --> 27:13.480]  with aqua tanks you know in the floods and we've got all give up our liberty
[27:13.480 --> 27:18.240]  because you know honey bees kill 200 plus people a year mass shootings 60 something
[27:18.240 --> 27:23.680]  but it doesn't matter and most of that gang related we've all got to give our
[27:23.680 --> 27:30.280]  rights up because it's so scary this is all an exercise in mind control LA
[27:30.280 --> 27:34.720]  Times broke down that the just department report of local crime statistics
[27:34.720 --> 27:41.720]  released this year and they said a 75% drop in shootings the way we broke it
[27:41.720 --> 27:47.160]  down is 49% there's different ways to look at it the point is more guns less
[27:47.160 --> 27:52.240]  crime areas that have high gun ownership almost no home invasions areas
[27:52.240 --> 27:57.200]  where there is no gun ownership it's how long earth ladies and gentlemen and
[27:57.200 --> 28:01.320]  they've got the DC police chief who's violated federal and state law and won't
[28:01.320 --> 28:06.240]  let citizens be armed and they arrest people that have toy bullets and give
[28:06.240 --> 28:12.000]  them felony charges you know disarmed empty shell casings and she's literally
[28:12.000 --> 28:17.040]  on TV giving a press conference right now in some type of beyond third world
[28:17.040 --> 28:21.640]  general outfit that looks like something from a judge dread cartoon in the
[28:21.640 --> 28:27.440]  1970s I mean she's got stars on her arm bigger than quarters on her shoulders
[28:27.440 --> 28:34.000]  absolutely clown like and they have hundreds and hundreds of deaths a year
[28:34.000 --> 28:39.680]  of disarmed slaves in DC but you'll never hear about that and it's just
[28:39.680 --> 28:44.480]  unbelievable grandstanding when they had the other police commander speaking
[28:44.480 --> 28:48.280]  that's behind her they're watching us on TV she was acting like she was crying
[28:48.280 --> 28:51.680]  I'm probably crying with glee that she'll be able to go out for the Second
[28:51.680 --> 28:56.740]  Amendment by the way Obama gave a speech last night this is up on info wars
[28:56.740 --> 29:04.680]  dot com Obama gave a speech last night a little aired on national television where
[29:04.680 --> 29:12.080]  he rolled out new gun control measures and he lied and said that 80 to 90% of
[29:12.080 --> 29:17.480]  Americans what new gun restrictions passed when all the polls showed the
[29:17.480 --> 29:23.920]  opposite just like he said no one believes the rebels may have used the
[29:23.920 --> 29:27.280]  chemical weapons he said no one on earth believes that in the same interview

[35:33.160 --> 35:37.960]  Federal Reserve because of the fact that he's really the main author if you've
[35:37.960 --> 35:41.040]  got to pick one person he's more guilty than anybody of getting rid of glass
[35:41.040 --> 35:47.560]  fecal and engineering the fraud that we've seen unfolding with the too big
[35:47.560 --> 35:53.240]  to fail and the derivatives that is all coming up as well today and some
[35:53.240 --> 35:58.880]  shootings you didn't hear about so much some shootings that didn't get a lot of
[35:58.880 --> 36:04.400]  attention remember last year when we heard a shooter shot nine people in
[36:04.400 --> 36:08.720]  New York City by the Empire State's building turned out one guy pulled a
[36:08.720 --> 36:15.600]  gun out and shot another hot dog vendor over fighting over space it was a
[36:15.600 --> 36:20.880]  business dispute going postal and then the police pulled their guns out and
[36:20.880 --> 36:25.600]  shot at least nine people was actually more than 15 that got small bullet
[36:25.600 --> 36:29.760]  fragments in them but nine people that they reported to have been shot then it
[36:29.760 --> 36:37.640]  came out a week later in the in the back of the paper here's Mike Adams article
[36:37.640 --> 36:43.240]  from naturalnews.com upon info wars.com NYPD cops accidentally use innocent
[36:43.240 --> 36:49.240]  bystanders for target practice again then I thought I would flashback there's ABC
[36:49.240 --> 36:56.920]  News reporting it to bystanders struck by NYPD cops opening fire on suspect near
[36:56.920 --> 37:02.840]  Times Square it was a man pulling out his key swipe his key swipe the guy got
[37:02.840 --> 37:06.120]  shot at locally in Austin for having a wallet in his hand a few weeks ago too I
[37:06.120 --> 37:12.280]  say execute everyone it's the only way the government can be safe NYPD nine shot
[37:12.280 --> 37:17.440]  nine bystanders again with police gunfire thought I'd have flashback to that to
[37:17.440 --> 37:21.200]  talk about you know just the fact that when the state's shooting people it's
[37:21.200 --> 37:25.200]  not a big deal but when they could say it's a citizen and oh they say he had an
[37:25.200 --> 37:33.240]  AR-15 an m16 an m4 type variant an assault rifle we've got to ban those well
[37:33.240 --> 37:35.920]  I have Kit Daniels doing an article right now that should be out in the next
[37:35.920 --> 37:41.920]  hour and info wars.com with the statistics that one of the least used
[37:41.920 --> 37:48.720]  guns in crime or in killing people in the United States is the m4 now the
[37:48.720 --> 37:53.520]  media is literally salivating over what type of gun it was like it did it so they
[37:53.520 --> 38:00.000]  can demonize that oh see it's the one copycats will then only start using that
[38:00.000 --> 38:03.760]  exclusively in mass shootings to create a self-fulfilling prophecy that's how
[38:03.760 --> 38:08.920]  advertisement works Gillette the best you know the best a man can get and the
[38:08.920 --> 38:11.840]  men all run out and get those because they believe that's the best a man can
[38:11.840 --> 38:17.000]  get that it becomes the most popular or they show you CURS commercials I saw one
[38:17.000 --> 38:22.880]  last night in a restaurant I was sitting in and if you drink CURS suddenly
[38:22.880 --> 38:27.880]  all of these beauty queen women run out the door to go home and have sex with
[38:27.880 --> 38:32.080]  you at your house immediately now that's not really what happens when you drink
[38:32.080 --> 38:37.360]  CURS you get a potbelly nothing against Adolf CURS and Anheuser-Busch and all
[38:37.360 --> 38:41.960]  the rest of them that's why dockies made the joke of the most interesting man in
[38:41.960 --> 38:45.960]  the world you know when that first came out years ago I thought it was real the
[38:45.960 --> 38:50.000]  first time I saw it because people are so cheesy and and acting cool is what
[38:50.000 --> 38:53.360]  people are into I thought my goodness they've gone over the top how
[38:53.360 --> 38:58.480]  ridiculously cheesy I want to stop drinking dockies that I've been drinking
[38:58.480 --> 39:02.800]  since I'd you know take some from my dad when I was 10 years old and go out and
[39:02.800 --> 39:07.400]  drink with my buddies on the golf course or whatever yeah I'm pretty horrible
[39:07.400 --> 39:11.200]  folks come on who didn't run off with a beer or two when you were 10 years old
[39:11.200 --> 39:16.160]  and and who didn't like steel grandpa cigarettes and go out and smoke them
[39:16.160 --> 39:22.000]  behind the barn and throw up all right I'm digressing the serious issue were
[39:22.000 --> 39:25.800]  you a witness are you are you in the area or have you worked there what's
[39:25.800 --> 39:30.360]  your take on it if you're in the DC area specifically though on the navel yard
[39:30.360 --> 39:41.240]  on the navel base we'd like to hear from you 800-259-9231 and we're going to
[39:41.240 --> 39:45.000]  continue to break all this down but before I go to your calls one final
[39:45.000 --> 39:48.760]  little tidbit and we'll play Obama's comments that we just taped he's wrapping
[39:48.760 --> 39:52.880]  the grandstanding up right now I wish he'd have a press conference for the
[39:52.880 --> 39:58.080]  tens of thousands of Christians killed by al Qaeda in Syria their heads chopped
[39:58.080 --> 40:01.880]  off their churches burned down oh I'm sorry he's funding them and who else is
[40:01.880 --> 40:07.520]  he funding remember the story from Friday September 13th leader of Syrian
[40:07.520 --> 40:13.000]  rebel group calls for attacks inside the US and he also just so happens to be the
[40:13.000 --> 40:20.480]  head of al Qaeda and then we link to Reuters al Qaeda's main leader al Zahari
[40:20.480 --> 40:24.040]  urged small-scale attacks inside the United States to bleed America
[40:24.040 --> 40:29.480]  economically adding he hoped eventually to see a more significant strike but he
[40:29.480 --> 40:33.080]  called for smaller mass shooting type events and what have I been saying the
[40:33.080 --> 40:37.120]  last three weeks I said I'm looking for false flags I'm looking for mass
[40:37.120 --> 40:41.000]  shootings we don't even have the crew to go back and pull me saying that
[40:41.000 --> 40:47.560]  probably let's be conservative 20 times the last three weeks maybe listeners can
[40:47.560 --> 40:51.880]  go back to the audio feed the podcast and find it put it on YouTube
[40:51.880 --> 40:55.960]  listeners called in and said that's what they thought would happen so they can
[40:55.960 --> 41:00.440]  also demonize the Second Amendment and get this even if these shooters because
[41:00.440 --> 41:04.080]  they're now saying I think there are one dead guy and two other suspects that's
[41:04.080 --> 41:08.240]  that's just now breaking we'll never hear of the truth because the very same
[41:08.240 --> 41:12.160]  group that ran the Boston bombing cover-up they admit the Boston bombing
[41:12.160 --> 41:17.400]  experts are there imagine if these guys these Patsy's or whoever they are would
[41:17.400 --> 41:22.160]  have gotten out of the Naval base the Naval yard they would have shut down all
[41:22.160 --> 41:27.640]  of DC in fact they've stopped air traffic at Reagan Airport out of fear
[41:27.640 --> 41:34.960]  that they've shut down and locked down all the DC schools this is absolutely
[41:34.960 --> 41:43.960]  ridiculous this is absolutely out of control that you can have four dead
[41:43.960 --> 41:50.080]  people you got thousands missing in in Colorado from the flood you got people
[41:50.080 --> 41:53.840]  dying and gas main explosions all over the country you got kids burning up six
[41:53.840 --> 41:58.600]  at a time inside their house you've got people dying today with deer jumping out
[41:58.600 --> 42:02.840]  in front of them wasp stinging them you've got all these series hundreds of
[42:02.840 --> 42:06.960]  thousands of deaths on the highways a year but you'd think the world had ended
[42:06.960 --> 42:11.240]  with the media and people in national studies I just covered it on the LA
[42:11.240 --> 42:18.240]  Times they believe that mass shootings are way up even though they're down the
[42:18.240 --> 42:27.520]  LA Times says 75% our numbers are overall shootings down 49% since 1992 and
[42:27.520 --> 42:31.600]  everybody who thinks about that knows that does your house get robbed less
[42:31.600 --> 42:34.920]  than it used to do you hear about less shootings in your area than you used to
[42:34.920 --> 42:43.160]  yeah if you don't live in LA New York DC Washington DC or a few other areas you
[42:43.160 --> 42:48.920]  have lower crime rates if you don't live in Laredo then you've got lower crime
[42:48.920 --> 42:53.160]  rates than you used to I mean I remember growing up in Dallas our house got robbed
[42:53.160 --> 42:56.920]  like once a year and we were in a good neighborhood you'd go out to the movies
[42:56.920 --> 43:00.560]  with your parents come home everything's stolen I remember growing up in rock
[43:00.560 --> 43:04.200]  wall our house got stolen quite a few times we lived in a nice lakeside golf
[43:04.200 --> 43:08.040]  course community I mean it was just but now criminals are afraid I remember
[43:08.040 --> 43:12.520]  carjackings almost every day growing up in the news as soon as concealed carry
[43:12.520 --> 43:17.800]  came in it all stopped because oh it's like Russian roulette if I try to car
[43:17.800 --> 43:22.680]  jack that car you don't hear about women getting grabbed when they're jogging
[43:22.680 --> 43:28.960]  anymore unless you're talking about Central Park and then the police are
[43:28.960 --> 43:33.360]  scared of it's a gang of 20 30 guys raping a woman in front of them it's so
[43:33.360 --> 43:38.000]  sick folks we've got a bunch of grandstanding cowards and government
[43:38.000 --> 43:42.840]  who stood down for hours while these shootings were going on and that's
[43:42.840 --> 43:46.920]  perfect that they make you stand down because the real cops can't discover
[43:46.920 --> 43:51.360]  whatever really happened while they make up the official story inside and we've
[43:51.360 --> 43:55.480]  got Anthony in Florida who worked at the Naval base for two years we've got
[43:55.480 --> 44:00.840]  Sean US Army Special Agent input on shooting we don't have anybody on the
[44:00.840 --> 44:05.200]  naval yard that has reportedly tens of thousands of people in it three thousand
[44:05.200 --> 44:12.840]  in that complex alone here's the number again 800 259 9231 I'd like to hear
[44:12.840 --> 44:18.200]  from you specifically about what you think happened my gut told me Islamic
[44:18.200 --> 44:22.600]  terrorists today just like the Fort Hood shooting when you get the head of Al
[44:22.600 --> 44:28.120]  Qaeda who's a known globalist double agent with his al-Nusra that he heads up
[44:28.120 --> 44:34.320]  running the main attacks in Syria he's got a debt to Obama to play the part of
[44:34.320 --> 44:38.600]  the bad guy to activate sleeper cells he's got again the sleeper cells don't
[44:38.600 --> 44:42.520]  know they work for the globalist just like the Fort Hood shooter for two years
[44:42.520 --> 44:49.600]  the psychiatrist on record was in communication with
[44:49.960 --> 44:56.520]  I'm an alzahari and of course other leaders of Al Qaeda in emails and phone
[44:56.520 --> 45:00.360]  calls and they've declared national security and will not release that and
[45:00.360 --> 45:04.400]  declared it non-terror related because they in that trial that was not a
[45:04.400 --> 45:09.240]  terrorism trial in Fort Hood was a 13 dead and then and of course that's
[45:09.240 --> 45:14.400]  terrorism because folks it was their guy they allowed that to happen to create
[45:14.400 --> 45:22.080]  the fear CIA on record was running that whole deal elements of it and so he says
[45:22.080 --> 45:26.600]  attack with low intensity attacks start going after Americans and we said last
[45:26.600 --> 45:31.080]  week hey I bet they'd start having mass shootings in America so they can then go
[45:31.080 --> 45:34.240]  after the guns at the same time and divert away from all this it's not hard
[45:34.240 --> 45:39.960]  to figure this stuff out all you do is put yourself in their mind and then
[45:39.960 --> 45:46.040]  later here's Al Jazeera Al Qaeda leader urges attacks on US soil bleed America
[45:46.040 --> 45:52.440]  boom now here's the problem the Boston bombing they tried to blame on
[45:52.440 --> 45:57.360]  patriot groups until we blew that wide open on record taken over their press
[45:57.360 --> 46:00.200]  conferences remember they said oh it's the announcement will be made later this
[46:00.200 --> 46:03.920]  afternoon it is a tea party type right-winger remember that and then all
[46:03.920 --> 46:07.880]  the sudden folks the photos got out there of all the Saudi Arabians and the
[46:07.880 --> 46:12.360]  other people so they shifted to plan B they always do that with people we know
[46:12.360 --> 46:17.560]  the older brother was on State Department CIA payroll with fake names as a
[46:17.560 --> 46:24.240]  double agent bare minimum and there was a drill and a standout they want to go
[46:24.240 --> 46:27.440]  with the mass shootings and bombings to really get everybody ready for the
[46:27.440 --> 46:31.680]  takeover just like the drill we got in Austin that they said was actually real
[46:31.680 --> 46:36.560]  for a terror attack last month we broke that that was later confirmed to be a
[46:36.560 --> 46:39.760]  real alert they put out but then they said oh don't worry it's not a real
[46:39.760 --> 46:45.520]  threat now but it is a real alert all of it's there ladies and gentlemen all of
[46:45.520 --> 46:49.760]  it's there and it's essential when these events happen this could be the first of
[46:49.760 --> 46:55.360]  many that you videotape and you get on record what happened because regardless
[46:55.360 --> 47:00.000]  of who's behind it who stands to gain who will use it and fear monger with it
[47:00.000 --> 47:05.040]  for their agenda to disarm the American people let's go to Anthony in Florida and
[47:05.040 --> 47:08.000]  then Sean and others you're on the air Anthony thank you for calling in today
[47:08.000 --> 47:11.640]  how's it going Alex first off I just want to thank you for everything you do
[47:11.640 --> 47:18.040]  I really appreciate down here appreciate you second off I was stationed at the
[47:18.040 --> 47:22.320]  Naval Yards for two years my girls in the service industry she knows a lot of
[47:22.320 --> 47:26.760]  troops down there and so we're looking through her Facebook and multiple
[47:26.760 --> 47:30.600]  people work there they have family members there and what's crazy it seems
[47:30.600 --> 47:35.600]  to be trending that a lot of people weren't at work today one in particular
[47:35.600 --> 47:40.160]  says thankful my wife mother-in-law and brother-in-law did not go to work today
[47:40.160 --> 47:44.640]  and then they say they're on stage but like I said a lot of people have
[47:44.640 --> 47:48.520]  multiple family members who work in the building and a lot of people weren't at
[47:48.520 --> 47:55.800]  work today do me a favor well we know in 9-11 the media called it a rumor but it
[47:55.800 --> 47:59.800]  turns out and then spun it into Israelis not being in the towers what was
[47:59.800 --> 48:05.360]  really said was Arab kids in New York Daily News you name it said those
[48:05.360 --> 48:09.080]  towers won't be there next week to their classes and there was even a police
[48:09.080 --> 48:14.480]  investigation so the media rather than focus on that spun it and said people
[48:14.480 --> 48:19.200]  say no Jews died when it was the media saying that themselves to change the
[48:19.200 --> 48:24.680]  subject and it turned out that the buildings were about half empty from
[48:24.680 --> 48:28.360]  what they would normally be at that building's occupancy the buildings were
[48:28.360 --> 48:32.120]  already about a third empty because of problems and asbestos but for the
[48:32.120 --> 48:35.760]  tenants that were there about half the people that day didn't go to work and it
[48:35.760 --> 48:43.520]  turned out people did get warnings not to go across the board and so retweet or
[48:43.520 --> 48:48.800]  or tweet at real Alex Jones examples and screenshots of what you're seeing on
[48:48.800 --> 48:53.120]  Facebook I'm gonna call Watson Paul Watson Steve Watson I'll tell my other
[48:53.120 --> 48:58.760]  crew we will look into the fact you're saying that it seems to be trending that
[48:58.760 --> 49:03.280]  people are saying there was a lot of folks not there today multiple members of
[49:03.280 --> 49:07.200]  the same family like not not inflicting them but I'm just saying it's pretty
[49:07.200 --> 49:11.960]  awkward that multiple people worked in the building that and were told to stay
[49:11.960 --> 49:14.680]  home I don't know if they were told to stay home for some reason they weren't
[49:14.680 --> 49:18.040]  about to say a facility that's got over 10,000 people at it you're gonna have a
[49:18.040 --> 49:20.600]  lot of people that are gonna end up not going to work today especially in
[49:20.600 --> 49:25.640]  government work but if they if anybody says those people need to be questioned
[49:25.640 --> 49:30.680]  immediately why didn't you go to work and if they say we were told don't come in
[49:30.680 --> 49:35.360]  there's gonna be a drill next week boy you know right there I mean that is and
[49:35.360 --> 49:42.200]  this is what we'll expect to see if it's a false flag it may be real crazies but
[49:42.200 --> 49:46.840]  look at the timing Obama rolling out a national campaign against guns yesterday
[49:46.840 --> 49:51.600]  and then this happens thank you so much Anthony let's go to Sean and Robert and
[49:51.600 --> 49:56.440]  John Sean's is US Army Special Agent input on shooting Sean what do you think
[49:56.440 --> 50:02.440]  about what's happening well the Department of Defense will be the
[50:02.440 --> 50:08.520]  president Bush 2004 signed the law enforcement officer safety act that
[50:08.520 --> 50:15.000]  authorized all retired or separated or active police officers to carry a firearm
[50:15.000 --> 50:20.560]  in all 50 states with reciprocity with every state the Department of Defense
[50:20.560 --> 50:27.520]  officer Inspector Kennell in 2007 rendered an opinion that only civilian
[50:27.520 --> 50:32.760]  special agents were covered by the law and that all military law enforcement
[50:32.760 --> 50:39.920]  officers and military federal agents were not covered in the law I tell you
[50:39.920 --> 50:44.480]  what this is key I remember this when this controversy happened again making
[50:44.480 --> 50:48.720]  the military bases sitting ducks just like the Fort Hood shooting which I
[50:48.720 --> 50:51.720]  remember correctly that's why they got that through stay there I'm gonna come
[50:51.720 --> 50:56.840]  back to you or that was one reason strided I want to hear about this this is

[55:28.000 --> 55:32.040]  get these articles and get these out now because obama just gave a speech and
[55:32.040 --> 55:36.560]  they're coming after the guns and obama went on television yesterday saying we
[55:36.560 --> 55:40.240]  got to go after the guns and that eighty plus percent of americans want to
[55:40.240 --> 55:47.480]  basically turn them in it's on and I mean come on this my gut tells me this is
[55:47.480 --> 55:51.600]  we're never gonna learn the truth of this okay and that they're getting ready
[55:51.600 --> 55:56.240]  to blame patriots now they may say it's a Muslim extremist that did it but then
[55:56.240 --> 56:00.880]  connect that to patriots even if it doesn't make sense MSNBC has no proof
[56:00.880 --> 56:05.760]  that the boston bombing patsy's are connected to me or the tea party but they
[56:05.760 --> 56:11.960]  said the tea party and alex jones made him do it I could totally sue him these
[56:11.960 --> 56:16.080]  are propagandas folks that tell you polar bears can't swim these are
[56:16.080 --> 56:19.480]  propagandas that say the earth's getting hotter when it's getting cooler these are
[56:19.480 --> 56:24.480]  propagandas who were known liars obama got on tv and said 80% of americans
[56:24.480 --> 56:29.440]  wanted his gun bills when all the polls showed almost 70% against it see he
[56:29.440 --> 56:31.880]  flips reality I said I'd go to your calls
[56:31.880 --> 56:38.920]  Sean I remember when this happened where they pass that law that any retired
[56:38.920 --> 56:45.080]  police officer or military person great idea could continue to have firearms
[56:45.080 --> 56:51.040]  when it's like your real national guard and then the military moved I think was
[56:51.040 --> 56:55.200]  the head of the army wasn't I forget give me notes on this so I can look it up
[56:55.200 --> 57:00.760]  and do a story on it that they then continue to make military bases these
[57:00.760 --> 57:06.640]  victim disarmament shooting spree zones repeat what you said before the break
[57:06.640 --> 57:14.080]  well in 2013 the senator lehi and senator webb attached a rider to the
[57:14.080 --> 57:19.040]  tents authorization act making it very clear that all retired military law
[57:19.040 --> 57:23.280]  enforcement officers and special agents worked out we're covered under the
[57:23.280 --> 57:28.560]  intent of the law and forced dod to accept that but today they have not
[57:28.560 --> 57:35.720]  issued any retired credentials to any former retired CID special agents in
[57:35.720 --> 57:43.640]  CIS CID agents and that's like DC DC has not fallen heller for five years so so
[57:43.640 --> 57:49.080]  give me the name of the act again that was signed under Bush so I can go look
[57:49.080 --> 57:54.720]  it up with the law enforcement officers safety act and the 2010 law
[57:54.720 --> 57:58.280]  enforcement officer safety act improvement act and then the defense
[57:58.280 --> 58:03.520]  authorization act of 2013 are the three acts that have have created that
[58:03.520 --> 58:08.280]  authority and amended that authority throughout the last decade essentially
[58:08.280 --> 58:12.120]  yeah that's right and again folks the NDA was massive that's just one part of it
[58:12.120 --> 58:17.080]  the bad parts the indefinite detention that's a good part right there so the
[58:17.080 --> 58:23.080]  law enforcement safety act of 2010 I thought that was under Bush that
[58:23.080 --> 58:31.600]  happened yeah that's right okay okay yeah okay exactly and so now watch they
[58:31.600 --> 58:35.520]  won't let you be armed when the answer is armed the people on the base anything

[1:00:19.840 --> 1:00:23.400]  Alex Jones
[1:00:31.680 --> 1:00:35.840]  we're getting some more information from our Justice Department and from our
[1:00:35.840 --> 1:00:39.880]  sources on the ground about what actually is transpiring inside the Navy
[1:00:39.880 --> 1:00:44.600]  Yard at this time and what we understand is that the same team that helped pull
[1:00:44.600 --> 1:00:49.160]  Johar Zarnaya from the boat in Boston when there was a great concern about
[1:00:49.160 --> 1:00:53.880]  additional explosives and what was actually going to transpire in the city
[1:00:53.880 --> 1:00:56.680]  of Boston that same team is on the ground in the Navy Yard and so they're
[1:00:56.680 --> 1:01:00.200]  really not taking anything off the table we may have this report that one
[1:01:00.200 --> 1:01:03.920]  shooter is dead but a question about whether or not there's still a risk to
[1:01:03.920 --> 1:01:07.880]  the area that's obviously something that law enforcement is not taking very
[1:01:07.880 --> 1:01:10.720]  lightly and continuing to you know folks this gives new meaning to the word
[1:01:10.720 --> 1:01:16.320]  drama queen when it comes out with a Fort Hood shooter they're not allowed to
[1:01:16.320 --> 1:01:21.040]  call a terrorism even though he was under the command of al-Qaeda and hundreds
[1:01:21.040 --> 1:01:25.640]  of emails and phone calls and who was the end of the command of he was under
[1:01:25.640 --> 1:01:34.000]  the command of the main Syrian rebel group I'm on al-Zawari who urged more
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:39.240]  small-scale attacks including mass shootings in the US last week and that's
[1:01:39.240 --> 1:01:43.960]  who our government's funding and arming going back to Sean whose US Army special
[1:01:43.960 --> 1:01:52.640]  agent that's like the guys you see that are leading private manning around what's
[1:01:52.640 --> 1:01:57.280]  his name now it's it's not Bradley Manning it's Chelsea Manning around it's
[1:01:57.280 --> 1:02:01.680]  what he wants to be called and yeah once they retire they're not allowed to
[1:02:01.680 --> 1:02:07.160]  carry guns outside of their home state anymore just like they disarmed the
[1:02:07.160 --> 1:02:11.120]  pilots most of them didn't do it because a red tape right before 9 11 you're
[1:02:11.120 --> 1:02:13.320]  gonna trust them to fly an airplane but you're not gonna trust them to have a
[1:02:13.320 --> 1:02:18.240]  gun and then airplanes like 100 that thousand a million times I mean what's
[1:02:18.240 --> 1:02:24.800]  the mass of an airplane going 600 miles an hour versus the grain of 50 caliber
[1:02:24.800 --> 1:02:30.360]  bullet I mean it's got to be a million times bigger or something I mean I don't
[1:02:30.360 --> 1:02:35.880]  know it's it is absolutely insane we can only trust TSA agents that go take a
[1:02:35.880 --> 1:02:40.360]  week-long course to stick their hands down our pants but finishing up Sean
[1:02:40.360 --> 1:02:42.840]  you're gonna make one other point about this I'm gonna go to Robert John and
[1:02:42.840 --> 1:02:48.400]  others okay the you know that what you're saying is absolutely correct that if we
[1:02:48.400 --> 1:02:53.400]  had the these folks carrying their weapons on post or on military bases
[1:02:53.400 --> 1:02:58.520]  they would be able to respond instantaneously to a threat but if the
[1:02:58.520 --> 1:03:03.720]  local installation commanders can make the installation a gun-free zone even
[1:03:03.720 --> 1:03:11.000]  to FBI CIA the NCIS or any other federal agent that would otherwise have
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:16.560]  authority to carry a firearm on that on that installation and then top it off
[1:03:16.560 --> 1:03:22.880]  the installation the local man authority decides whether or not military
[1:03:22.880 --> 1:03:29.000]  policemen perform their patrol duties with loaded guns or a weapon that has a
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:33.080]  magazine loaded but not that they chamber or if the magazine is in their
[1:03:33.080 --> 1:03:38.400]  pouch and these people are doing patrol duties and and responding to domestic
[1:03:38.400 --> 1:03:43.480]  assaults doing traffic stops with empty guns you're joking you're Joe hold on
[1:03:43.480 --> 1:03:47.240]  that is incredibly newsworthy I mean I believe you but I'm gonna I didn't know
[1:03:47.240 --> 1:03:51.720]  that you're telling me military police are patrolling in some cases with their
[1:03:51.720 --> 1:03:57.800]  firearms unloaded and stowed absolutely and in you know we had one extreme case
[1:03:57.800 --> 1:04:02.760]  where the provost Marshall was requiring his folks to do to get hit their
[1:04:02.760 --> 1:04:07.720]  magazines with ammunition he's healed in a bag and they had to check it out of
[1:04:07.720 --> 1:04:13.000]  the arms room and check it back in inside of this each ill bag and if it was
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:15.920]  open they did what's called a 15-6 investigation
[1:04:15.920 --> 1:04:22.480]  commander's inquiry as to why that police officer that military policemen open
[1:04:22.480 --> 1:04:27.120]  their heat shield bag man talk about control freaks I mean that's like where
[1:04:27.120 --> 1:04:31.080]  the Secretary of Defense Panetta member wouldn't be around armed troops so
[1:04:31.080 --> 1:04:38.960]  where would I find that policy because I've never heard of that their local
[1:04:38.960 --> 1:04:43.760]  policies at the installation level that each provost Marshall decides on their
[1:04:43.760 --> 1:04:50.600]  own and I would find that one in Pentagon based security policy manuals
[1:04:50.600 --> 1:04:59.240]  would you find that Pentagon based security policy manuals we're gonna

[1:08:41.280 --> 1:08:47.320]  say you now know the department of education is now running the water
[1:08:47.320 --> 1:08:53.720]  systems in louisiana a little attempt at sick humor but it's actually not sick
[1:08:53.720 --> 1:08:58.680]  humor they put sodium fluoride and hydrofluorosalic acid in the water that
[1:08:58.680 --> 1:09:05.440]  lowers the IQ on average 17 points for women 23 points for boys who drink it
[1:09:05.440 --> 1:09:10.280]  during the first 10 years of life that's a major Harvard study I just thought I'd
[1:09:10.280 --> 1:09:13.720]  throw that out there we're worried about brain-eating amoebas that might kill
[1:09:13.720 --> 1:09:19.000]  wait for it five to six people a year that's the number I know because they
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:22.760]  haven't been like Travis and so I'm up on that data because I don't go out there
[1:09:22.760 --> 1:09:25.920]  in August because that there are brain-eating amoebas and there's probably
[1:09:25.920 --> 1:09:29.440]  one chance out of a million that my children might get one when the lake's
[1:09:29.440 --> 1:09:34.960]  90 degrees I don't want to swim on its 90 degrees anyways but there you go
[1:09:34.960 --> 1:09:39.040]  folks we need to ban swimming because there might be an amoeba in it and the
[1:09:39.040 --> 1:09:43.200]  reason I mentioned that is it's the same idea of these mass shootings
[1:09:43.200 --> 1:09:49.200]  statistically there's 64 to 63 just departments own numbers people killed in
[1:09:49.200 --> 1:09:54.800]  mass shootings every year and less than 30 of those are real mass shootings where
[1:09:54.800 --> 1:09:58.760]  it's done to be a mass shooting they call gang related to gang shooting each
[1:09:58.760 --> 1:10:03.520]  other and then bystanders get shot up in a restaurant or in a college campus
[1:10:03.520 --> 1:10:09.280]  less than 70 people if you want to source on that the entire nightly news
[1:10:09.280 --> 1:10:13.000]  tonight 7 o'clock central we're gonna be covering that but here's the LA Times
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:18.600]  gun crime is plunged but Americans think it's up study says more than half of
[1:10:18.600 --> 1:10:22.000]  Americans think gun crime has jumped the Bureau of Justice statistics report
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  noted researchers aren't sure why there's the misrepresentation the rate of
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:35.600]  violent crimes fell more sharply 75% so some types of gun crime is 75% our
[1:10:35.600 --> 1:10:43.840]  number is 49% overall violent gun you know illegal gun crime 49% drop as high
[1:10:43.840 --> 1:10:47.880]  75 so that's the facts we've covered that at nauseam
[1:10:47.880 --> 1:10:52.480]  Obama comes out with snort anophilus snoof anophilus whatever his name is the
[1:10:52.480 --> 1:10:59.360]  former Clinton minion and George Stephanophilus folks I'm being sarcastic
[1:10:59.360 --> 1:11:03.080]  again and a said that no one in the world thinks the rebels might have
[1:11:03.080 --> 1:11:07.560]  launched a chemical attack what an alternate universe and that also we have
[1:11:07.560 --> 1:11:16.520]  the clip coming up that over 80% of Americans believe that they want to you
[1:11:16.520 --> 1:11:21.240]  know get the anti-gun bills passed support that now of course you know the
[1:11:21.240 --> 1:11:26.120]  polls were the pretty much the opposite upwards of 70% were against the gun
[1:11:26.120 --> 1:11:30.400]  grab and it blew up in their face and that came out but not an Obama universe
[1:11:30.400 --> 1:11:37.560]  I mean he is the most ball-faced liar I've ever seen and it gets worse their
[1:11:37.560 --> 1:11:42.880]  policy is not to tell the truth now that they've been caught lying it's now to
[1:11:42.880 --> 1:11:47.360]  double and triple and quadruple down with the deception now we trust but
[1:11:47.360 --> 1:11:53.160]  verify as Reagan said and we had a caller earlier who said that he was a army
[1:11:53.160 --> 1:11:57.280]  a special agent it's one of the armed kind of you know army investigator guys
[1:11:57.280 --> 1:12:04.040]  and he said look it up a lot of bases don't let the the police even a much
[1:12:04.040 --> 1:12:08.480]  less other military people carry guns we went and looked it up and found all the
[1:12:08.480 --> 1:12:16.040]  news about it we found regulatory quotes on it but but actually no news that's
[1:12:16.040 --> 1:12:21.720]  very newsworthy I gave it to Daniels one of our great writers amazing show we
[1:12:21.720 --> 1:12:26.640]  need to look at this base were they precluding all the special agents and
[1:12:26.640 --> 1:12:31.880]  everybody else from being armed another victim another victim disarmament
[1:12:31.880 --> 1:12:35.800]  zone just like Fort Hood nobody was allowed to have guns and they had to
[1:12:35.800 --> 1:12:40.280]  run and find their guns and wait five minutes for the cops to show up which
[1:12:40.280 --> 1:12:43.400]  was still a good response time but he wouldn't have been able to kill 13
[1:12:43.400 --> 1:12:48.480]  people if that was the case and then Al Qaeda's leader announced Friday he's
[1:12:48.480 --> 1:12:51.920]  also the leader of the main Syrian rebels that Obama's arming that he wanted
[1:12:51.920 --> 1:12:56.600]  mass shootings in America everybody forgets that we have it up on info wars
[1:12:56.600 --> 1:13:04.160]  dot com the headline Navy yard shooting related to
[1:13:04.160 --> 1:13:08.640]  Zawahari's call from attacks and that's a great headline but it really should be
[1:13:08.640 --> 1:13:14.560]  is the naval yard attack connected to Al Qaeda call for mass shootings or Al Qaeda
[1:13:14.560 --> 1:13:19.160]  call for mass shootings is it related I don't know but now they're saying two
[1:13:19.160 --> 1:13:23.440]  shooters one dead one injured three other shooters on the loose who knows
[1:13:23.440 --> 1:13:28.520]  what the truth is but remember it's all a good distraction from last week fewer
[1:13:28.520 --> 1:13:37.800]  Americans than ever trust government to handle problems in a new Gallup poll and
[1:13:37.800 --> 1:13:45.720]  Congress has a 10% approval rating and Obama has lost more than 25% in under
[1:13:45.720 --> 1:13:50.120]  30s it was 17% last month now it's 20 plus percent he is in free fall with all
[1:13:50.120 --> 1:13:54.200]  of his scandals but never mind there's a cryptic White House message that came
[1:13:54.200 --> 1:14:01.640]  out saying respect authority do what you're told during emergencies and
[1:14:01.640 --> 1:14:04.520]  again just thank God one of these shooters didn't get outside the base so
[1:14:04.520 --> 1:14:07.960]  they would have shut down all of DC and they did shut down Reagan International
[1:14:07.960 --> 1:14:13.000]  and they did shut down a bunch of the schools and they told everybody shelter
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:17.240]  in place in the cafeteria where they were being shot we played the clip from a
[1:14:17.240 --> 1:14:23.640]  press conference last hour they told everybody we want you to basically sit
[1:14:23.640 --> 1:14:29.760]  there and just let yourself be shot but first I want to play this clip of where
[1:14:29.760 --> 1:14:33.400]  they are announcing we're getting calls and saying did you hear that the same
[1:14:33.400 --> 1:14:38.440]  federal group that went in was involved in the Boston bombing cover-up that they
[1:14:38.440 --> 1:14:45.160]  were dispatched to this and yes indeed so you can know this if they covered up
[1:14:45.160 --> 1:14:52.520]  the Boston bombing and they clearly stage that can we can we believe can we
[1:14:52.520 --> 1:15:00.800]  believe the official story of what we were told with this so here's that clip
[1:15:00.800 --> 1:15:04.840]  we're getting some more information from our Justice Department and from our
[1:15:04.840 --> 1:15:08.880]  sources on the ground about what actually is transpiring inside the Navy
[1:15:08.880 --> 1:15:13.840]  Yard at this time and what we understand is that the same team that helped pull
[1:15:13.840 --> 1:15:18.080]  Johar Zarnaya from the boat in Boston when there was a great concern about
[1:15:18.080 --> 1:15:22.880]  additional explosives and what was actually going to transpire in the city
[1:15:22.880 --> 1:15:25.640]  of Boston that same team is on the ground in the Navy Yard and so they're
[1:15:25.640 --> 1:15:29.180]  really not taking anything off the table good we may have this report that one
[1:15:29.180 --> 1:15:34.000]  shooter is dead but a question about whether or not that's enough again
[1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:39.440]  ladies and gentlemen we're looking at the latest numbers of dead upon info
[1:15:39.440 --> 1:15:44.880]  wars dot-com prison planet dot-com our backup site not really a mirror has a
[1:15:44.880 --> 1:15:49.360]  lot of original news on it as well so prison planet dot-com info wars dot-com
[1:15:49.360 --> 1:15:56.360]  drugs report dot-com has great coverage as well at least six dead pin wounded AP
[1:15:56.360 --> 1:16:00.480]  reports at least one shooter dead DC police chief says two other shooters
[1:16:00.480 --> 1:16:08.200]  may be at large also wearing military style uniforms 3,000 workers told the
[1:16:08.200 --> 1:16:12.860]  shelter in place at least two cops among the victims in BC reports a war zone
[1:16:12.860 --> 1:16:18.560]  SWAT style teams deployed at Capitol and all over DC homeland says no connections
[1:16:18.560 --> 1:16:22.000]  to terrorism kind of like the Fort Hood shooting if it really is Alcada
[1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:26.560]  connected where our government's funding them then they'll say it wasn't terror
[1:16:26.560 --> 1:16:29.600]  and then that's good because they can then blame it on the American gun owner
[1:16:29.600 --> 1:16:36.680]  that that's their favorite thing and then a White House is telling citizens to
[1:16:36.680 --> 1:16:41.320]  listen to the authorities and we've also got shooting from the fourth floor
[1:16:41.320 --> 1:16:45.320]  overlook aiming at people in the cafeteria who again were told to just
[1:16:45.320 --> 1:16:50.000]  sit there and take it just ridiculous I shouldn't laugh it's so sick you got
[1:16:50.000 --> 1:16:54.040]  that training video we have up on the site where they tell you to to use
[1:16:54.040 --> 1:16:59.440]  shoes or scissors that's up on info wars dot-com a flashback to that Julie
[1:16:59.440 --> 1:17:05.120]  Wilson put that out and then a Russian official mocks a clear confirmation of
[1:17:05.120 --> 1:17:09.880]  American exceptionalism you know that's disgusting that the Russians are gloating
[1:17:09.880 --> 1:17:15.040]  over this but that's one idiot roll in this together trying to stop World War
[1:17:15.040 --> 1:17:18.800]  3 we've got some good news abortion clinics closing at record rates as
[1:17:18.800 --> 1:17:22.640]  abortion becomes unpopular despite them trying to force feed it on everybody
[1:17:22.640 --> 1:17:30.960]  good news Obama may meet Iran's leader at the UN draws a new red line so there's
[1:17:30.960 --> 1:17:34.000]  a lot of things happening I haven't gotten all the other news Obama care
[1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:39.800]  will question your sex life Congress gets sneaky exemption from law punishes
[1:17:39.800 --> 1:17:44.200]  senator who tries to stop it there are death panels in there the senators
[1:17:44.200 --> 1:17:49.440]  reporting and confusion is reigning polls show Americans are absolutely
[1:17:49.440 --> 1:17:53.720]  against it it is meant to shut the country down and bankrupt the average
[1:17:53.720 --> 1:17:58.080]  person folks it's written by offshore banks the good news is people are
[1:17:58.080 --> 1:18:03.040]  waking up to it but that's okay because Obama gave a speech and said the war has
[1:18:03.040 --> 1:18:08.400]  come home to our military you know many military die from all the deadly
[1:18:08.400 --> 1:18:12.840]  vaccines and drugs they're given you know many military die from the horrible
[1:18:12.840 --> 1:18:18.400]  care at the VA but again you never hear about that the the the sewer mainstream
[1:18:18.400 --> 1:18:24.400]  media that's dying is still during crisis able to set the agenda but not for
[1:18:24.400 --> 1:18:28.880]  long and more and more than new media the real media that Diane Feinstein and
[1:18:28.880 --> 1:18:33.120]  and others say that they want to shut down and and and regulate they're
[1:18:33.120 --> 1:18:37.120]  losing control let's go to a call here from John and Marilyn then we're gonna

[1:18:46.280 --> 1:18:51.560]  um you know considering the last couple of shootings that we've had this is like
[1:18:51.560 --> 1:18:56.880]  the first one where the US government is like the victim and the hero at the
[1:18:56.880 --> 1:19:03.320]  same time and um and the last attacks didn't go so well you know we we exposed
[1:19:03.320 --> 1:19:08.520]  the balsam bombing thing and you know that the the school shooting in Sandy
[1:19:08.520 --> 1:19:13.800]  Hook and the movie theater shooting you know it just it didn't work it kind of
[1:19:13.800 --> 1:19:17.400]  backfired on them yes so now they're doing it if it is a false flag on their
[1:19:17.400 --> 1:19:21.280]  own turf or they can control it why don't they just do this on a movie lot

[1:24:15.520 --> 1:24:18.640]  Guard he was telling us about drills they just had yeah they're having a
[1:24:18.640 --> 1:24:23.080]  terrorism drills and martial law drills and power-out drills all over the
[1:24:23.080 --> 1:24:28.720]  country right now that again blowing up things on the tarmac in Boston not
[1:24:28.720 --> 1:24:33.920]  telling people it's a drill it's all psychological operations and we have
[1:24:33.920 --> 1:24:38.640]  Pentagon documents where they plan mass shootings on military bases to be blamed
[1:24:38.640 --> 1:24:43.160]  on their political enemies it's operation Northwoods so anything is
[1:24:43.160 --> 1:24:47.320]  possible with this is perfect timing we know they staged the Boston bombing that
[1:24:47.320 --> 1:24:53.600]  evidence is overwhelming incontrovertible let's go to John in Maryland finish up
[1:24:53.600 --> 1:24:59.160]  your point so um yeah well it's drill as that's just what they call it we weren't
[1:24:59.160 --> 1:25:02.200]  actually doing any drills it was just it was just some regular training but
[1:25:02.200 --> 1:25:06.600]  sure sure yeah we're talking about your meetings call drill yeah yeah everybody's
[1:25:06.600 --> 1:25:11.040]  talking about 9-11 in Syria and all this stuff and um but you know after that
[1:25:11.040 --> 1:25:14.680]  they compile all these reports and then you know during the week the National
[1:25:14.680 --> 1:25:18.200]  Guard guys that are full-time they sit around and they talk about it and they
[1:25:18.200 --> 1:25:21.480]  break it down and you know the leadership and all that and guess I guess
[1:25:21.480 --> 1:25:23.680]  it's on their mind right now where they're talking about everything they
[1:25:23.680 --> 1:25:29.680]  went over I think that's interesting and then you were talking about two weeks
[1:25:29.680 --> 1:25:33.600]  ago you were asking for people what would they do if they were going to
[1:25:33.600 --> 1:25:39.120]  launch a false flag attack and most of color said a mass shooting at basis yes
[1:25:39.120 --> 1:25:43.680]  and and I'm thinking like next level right because you know obviously it's
[1:25:43.680 --> 1:25:48.000]  not gonna end after today so you know you got this you got this missing nuke and
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:50.840]  these power outage drills and all that stuff and you have this inherent
[1:25:50.840 --> 1:25:55.160]  characteristic of a nuclear weapon where there's this EMP blast that comes out of
[1:25:55.160 --> 1:26:00.080]  it and I'm thinking you know it's it's female region 3 where you know the
[1:26:00.080 --> 1:26:04.760]  major drill the major cross-agency drill is going to happen and if the power
[1:26:04.760 --> 1:26:12.280]  goes out for a little while within you know 3 or 400 miles of the DC area you
[1:26:12.280 --> 1:26:17.160]  can have a small purge of any counter-revolutionaries that they've
[1:26:17.160 --> 1:26:25.320]  blacklisted and create a buffer zone for the DC area you know it's funny you say
[1:26:25.320 --> 1:26:29.800]  that because the Pentagon came out last year this made national news and said
[1:26:29.800 --> 1:26:33.720]  they were training to fight the Tea Party on the east coast and when you say
[1:26:33.720 --> 1:26:38.600]  this the globalist are occupiers and they see America waking up they could be
[1:26:38.600 --> 1:26:42.920]  capable of shutting the power off nationwide to bring in martial law
[1:26:42.920 --> 1:26:47.200]  blaming it on their enemies as an excuse to finally take the country because we
[1:26:47.200 --> 1:26:51.440]  think of the government as as being part of the country no it's the takeover
[1:26:51.440 --> 1:26:57.080]  group they behave just like a foreign enemy because they are and anything is
[1:26:57.080 --> 1:27:01.840]  possible that is very well said yeah and they love beta testing everything they
[1:27:01.840 --> 1:27:09.320]  never go right right off the bat they have to initiate some people into the
[1:27:09.320 --> 1:27:12.440]  program that's because they're scientists that it's a scientific
[1:27:12.440 --> 1:27:17.080]  dictatorship and they always pre-test you're absolutely right without a doubt
[1:27:17.080 --> 1:27:22.280]  and if there's a couple isolated blackouts all over the country or just on
[1:27:22.280 --> 1:27:26.400]  the east coast and then that that infects other systems or something and we
[1:27:26.400 --> 1:27:29.960]  need better cybersecurity and then cybersecurity saves us you're a genius
[1:27:29.960 --> 1:27:34.880]  God bless you absolutely any of this is very possible maybe even probable unless
[1:27:34.880 --> 1:27:40.160]  we expose it Robert used to work at the Naval base Robert calling from DC what
[1:27:40.160 --> 1:27:45.320]  is your breakdown sir thank you for calling hi Alex well basically I used
[1:27:45.320 --> 1:27:49.360]  to work there they I know that they would periodically have the active
[1:27:49.360 --> 1:27:53.040]  denial system where they would actually have everything on speaker you know
[1:27:53.040 --> 1:27:58.040]  doing these this it's kind of like a fire drill so I mean of course they're
[1:27:58.040 --> 1:28:02.560]  prepared for events like this and they act like they're not me personally I
[1:28:02.560 --> 1:28:06.520]  joined freedom from covert harassment what they did to me was they implanted
[1:28:06.520 --> 1:28:10.200]  me with the RFID chip and I got an infection in my neck I'm still in the
[1:28:10.200 --> 1:28:13.760]  process of getting this out and funny enough my neighbor knows you who he's
[1:28:13.760 --> 1:28:17.360]  been asking me to call you but basically I joined freedom from covert
[1:28:17.360 --> 1:28:20.920]  harassment they really started targeting me bad they would actually chase me
[1:28:20.920 --> 1:28:26.840]  around DC and gangstalk me they as in these look like DOD officials and they
[1:28:26.840 --> 1:28:30.720]  know what's going on they're basically causing a lot of turmoil out there
[1:28:30.720 --> 1:28:34.800]  well you know what's crazy about this and I appreciate your call sir is that
[1:28:34.800 --> 1:28:38.880]  as wild as that sounds they haven't planted a lot of DOD people with chips
[1:28:38.880 --> 1:28:42.440]  that's been in the news you know the fact that the classified programs are
[1:28:42.440 --> 1:28:46.160]  there but there's also a lot of people then that are schizophrenic who also get
[1:28:46.160 --> 1:28:49.600]  freaked out by all this but they don't need to implant you your smartphone
[1:28:49.600 --> 1:28:55.160]  tracks everything you do your car tracks you now a new cars that your smart
[1:28:55.160 --> 1:29:00.040]  meter does it they're building this spy grid in everywhere Chris in Tennessee
[1:29:00.040 --> 1:29:04.320]  you say you can confirm we've now confirmed that they have disarmed many
[1:29:04.320 --> 1:29:08.880]  of the bases as well so even security personnel can't have loaded firearms

[1:33:49.400 --> 1:33:53.080]  you've got the scandal of our government running al-qaeda against the serians
[1:33:53.080 --> 1:33:57.640]  you've got all of Obama's scandals coming out the fact that the Republican
[1:33:57.640 --> 1:34:01.600]  leadership's working with Obama all these different corrupt operations the
[1:34:01.600 --> 1:34:05.840]  American people waking up across the political spectrum coming together
[1:34:05.840 --> 1:34:10.960]  against all the tyranny that's taking place the two big to fail banks and then
[1:34:10.960 --> 1:34:16.640]  magically you get a mass shooting at a military base a very controlled area and
[1:34:16.640 --> 1:34:21.640]  they are reporting first they said three shooters then they said to now they're
[1:34:21.640 --> 1:34:25.100]  saying three again two more possible suspects wearing military style
[1:34:25.100 --> 1:34:29.800]  uniforms at the Navy Yard we're going to continue after Ed Asner leaves us he's
[1:34:29.800 --> 1:34:35.120]  been very gracious to come on on short notice and just spend 10 minutes with us
[1:34:35.120 --> 1:34:40.400]  of course Ed Asner really doesn't need any introduction he's been the head of
[1:34:40.400 --> 1:34:45.040]  the screen actors Guild start and or the 50 major motion pictures and the top
[1:34:45.040 --> 1:34:51.960]  TVs show course Lou Grant as well and he joins us he's been in so many great
[1:34:51.960 --> 1:34:56.480]  films one of my favorites was up a good wholesome show that's a film of my
[1:34:56.480 --> 1:34:59.960]  children have watched I don't think four or five times I love it and he just
[1:34:59.960 --> 1:35:03.800]  joins us because he has a lot of courage that other people in Hollywood don't have
[1:35:03.800 --> 1:35:08.960]  obviously and last Friday it was big national news when he'd gone on the
[1:35:08.960 --> 1:35:14.400]  O'Reilly Factor and other shows because he'd given a statement to Hollywood
[1:35:14.400 --> 1:35:19.120]  reporter saying look most people in Hollywood won't criticize Obama because
[1:35:19.120 --> 1:35:23.680]  they don't want to be called racist and it doesn't matter what you criticize
[1:35:23.680 --> 1:35:29.560]  banker bailouts indie AA these wars you do it you get called a racist and I
[1:35:29.560 --> 1:35:34.200]  think that that takes away from when people really are racist and need to be
[1:35:34.200 --> 1:35:39.240]  called racist and I see this more and more MSNBC has said I'm deeply racist
[1:35:39.240 --> 1:35:43.520]  and then didn't say why I'm deeply racist just that I didn't support Obama
[1:35:43.520 --> 1:35:48.760]  well I didn't support George W. Bush either and expose 9-11 clearly as an
[1:35:48.760 --> 1:35:52.920]  inside job along with that asner and others I mean the truth is the truth is
[1:35:52.920 --> 1:35:58.560]  the truth so I wanted to get Ed on to elaborate on it's almost like a red
[1:35:58.560 --> 1:36:06.200]  scare but this time you can't criticize Obama or you get you get I better not
[1:36:06.200 --> 1:36:09.520]  say blackball that'll be racist you know they can't even use brown paper bags
[1:36:09.520 --> 1:36:15.040]  now in Washington state because they say that's racist I never heard of that
[1:36:15.040 --> 1:36:19.280]  being racist so so instead of going after real racism they're inverting the
[1:36:19.280 --> 1:36:23.680]  world now and saying you support the corrupt policies of the government or
[1:36:23.680 --> 1:36:28.320]  you're a racist I wanted to get Ed's take on that and also the 50th anniversary of
[1:36:28.320 --> 1:36:33.080]  the murder of JFK I know he's one of the best stars of one of my favorite films
[1:36:33.080 --> 1:36:38.120]  JFK that Oliver Stone produced but I wanted to get his take on 50 years later
[1:36:38.120 --> 1:36:45.120]  Ed Asner thanks for popping in sir hey I'm always happy to be a part buddy you
[1:36:45.120 --> 1:36:48.200]  bet well thank you for coming on short notice I just wanted you to briefly give
[1:36:48.200 --> 1:36:53.400]  us your take and elaborate on the Hollywood reporter story and and what
[1:36:53.400 --> 1:36:58.800]  other stars and and famous folks are telling you why they're scared to
[1:36:58.800 --> 1:37:04.640]  criticize Obama well nobody has said a thing to me and I'm not even sure what
[1:37:04.640 --> 1:37:09.360]  my actual quote was as to I said well there probably are people who don't
[1:37:09.360 --> 1:37:16.280]  want to indict or doll Obama because they don't want to criticize a black
[1:37:16.280 --> 1:37:23.080]  president but the interesting to me with the press is that everybody passes the
[1:37:23.080 --> 1:37:34.320]  question as O'Reilly did with me he said our people the question are people not
[1:37:34.320 --> 1:37:40.920]  that criticize because he's black they posit the question bring me on and then
[1:37:40.920 --> 1:37:51.640]  it becomes my my affirmative statement that blacks are are not challenged when
[1:37:51.640 --> 1:38:00.360]  they're the president so they made it my question and and it's amazing to me how
[1:38:00.360 --> 1:38:07.800]  convoluted and and untrustworthy the press can be when they follow that
[1:38:07.800 --> 1:38:14.080]  process so you're basically saying that maybe the reporter took you out of
[1:38:14.080 --> 1:38:19.440]  context and then O'Reilly obsessed on it but but undoubtedly I think there is
[1:38:19.440 --> 1:38:25.960]  some truth to the gist of what you said because because the maybe but I am I've
[1:38:25.960 --> 1:38:31.440]  not talked to anyone I don't ask anyone it's their business I'll let them feel
[1:38:31.440 --> 1:38:41.280]  whatever they need to feel I I am delighted that that what what's his
[1:38:41.280 --> 1:38:52.120]  name Cornell West and and a lot of other folks smiley have have taken his issue
[1:38:52.120 --> 1:38:56.800]  with the Obama and of course they get away with it because they're black but
[1:38:56.800 --> 1:39:01.400]  they'll probably pull the same thing on them as they do on Jews who criticize the
[1:39:01.400 --> 1:39:07.800]  Israel and call them self-hating Jews or self-hating blacks yeah that's what's
[1:39:07.800 --> 1:39:13.000]  sad about the Obama thing I mean I knew he was going to be cynical and be the
[1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:17.160]  same as the establishment had done before him but I did hope it would help
[1:39:17.160 --> 1:39:21.520]  with race relations and unfortunately they put statistics out that they're
[1:39:21.520 --> 1:39:26.200]  really lost a lot of that because the media has been playing the race card so
[1:39:26.200 --> 1:39:31.960]  much yeah yeah I think I think it's time that they stop it I think it's time they
[1:39:31.960 --> 1:39:37.760]  grow up certainly it's time for people to ignore the inferences that the media
[1:39:37.760 --> 1:39:47.440]  makes on this color business I said I tried to send a response to the Chicago
[1:39:47.440 --> 1:39:58.680]  defender who attacked me as a racist for my statements and I said my my my the
[1:39:58.680 --> 1:40:04.960]  Chicago defender selling its paper by accusing me of being a racist and of
[1:40:04.960 --> 1:40:09.400]  course that's a famous when pigs fly oh and pigs fly well I mean that's a famous
[1:40:09.400 --> 1:40:16.680]  black paper for those that don't know yeah yeah oh I've been doing pretty good
[1:40:16.680 --> 1:40:19.360]  just watching the whole world meltdown but I tell you there's been some good
[1:40:19.360 --> 1:40:24.520]  news the entire attempt to escalate the Syrian civil war and the fact that the
[1:40:24.520 --> 1:40:28.480]  Pentagon and others have been running al-Qaeda that really blew up an Obama's
[1:40:28.480 --> 1:40:33.840]  face and it's good to see some peace talks starting up what has been your
[1:40:33.840 --> 1:40:39.200]  take on the whole push to start and not just a bombardment but boots on the
[1:40:39.200 --> 1:40:49.680]  ground in Syria well I think it sucks naturally I mean that that that that
[1:40:49.680 --> 1:40:56.640]  creature that diabolical creature Vladimir Putin is in the catbird seat
[1:40:56.640 --> 1:41:04.280]  that's first time ever saw a bolster in the catbird seat the the ability to
[1:41:04.280 --> 1:41:12.680]  propose this idea which we find as a as a straw to clutch at our Obama does
[1:41:12.680 --> 1:41:21.600]  anyway and man or Putin if he wants to screw it up and make Obama look even
[1:41:21.600 --> 1:41:27.120]  worse can he ain't get away as well well you're right all people romanticize
[1:41:27.120 --> 1:41:34.440]  Putin but I mean he's really a scary guy yeah and certainly and the man who
[1:41:34.440 --> 1:41:40.160]  certainly the best at his homework and I'm sure still does it I mean I think his
[1:41:40.160 --> 1:41:49.320]  policies on homosexuals and and the girl banned are despicable but I think he's
[1:41:49.320 --> 1:41:55.000]  cottoning to the general flow of feeling of his people well I was about to say it's
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:41:58.520]  not just Putin the media has even gone oh look Russia's making America look bad
[1:41:58.520 --> 1:42:03.600]  how about Russia's made the warmongers look bad you've got 91% of Americans in
[1:42:03.600 --> 1:42:10.600]  a Reuters poll Ed Asner who are against this war I'm kind of proud of the
[1:42:10.600 --> 1:42:15.160]  American people left right center libertarian you name it really coming
[1:42:15.160 --> 1:42:18.720]  together against war I think there's a major sea change happening what does that
[1:42:18.720 --> 1:42:32.040]  Asner say well the problem is that you know anytime people try to actually help
[1:42:32.040 --> 1:42:36.480]  the poor big big special interest come in and scoop it up now yet I want to ask
[1:42:36.480 --> 1:42:40.720]  you about getting back to the whole race thing a little bit here talking to
[1:42:40.720 --> 1:42:45.800]  folks in Hollywood then why do you think some of the so-called left has not been
[1:42:45.800 --> 1:42:51.000]  critical of Obama more outside of the race issue I just don't think they felt
[1:42:51.000 --> 1:42:56.280]  the urgent nature also they expended themselves pretty well on the Iraq and
[1:42:56.280 --> 1:43:01.880]  of course that that went down the toilet million people in the streets didn't
[1:43:01.880 --> 1:43:14.360]  didn't bother George W. at all so I think they it was too early to react they
[1:43:14.360 --> 1:43:19.480]  don't feel like reacting at every time a whistle was blown so they probably were
[1:43:19.480 --> 1:43:25.600]  waiting to take action and now it's been taken out of their hands they also saw
[1:43:25.600 --> 1:43:32.840]  that a majority of the people were already against the action now Ed Asner
[1:43:32.840 --> 1:43:38.440]  in closing and we appreciate you popping into the broadcast today I wanted to talk
[1:43:38.440 --> 1:43:43.720]  about JFK and his assassination in Dallas 50 years ago coming up here in
[1:43:43.720 --> 1:43:49.160]  just a few months and I know of course you started a great job in the film and
[1:43:49.160 --> 1:43:57.760]  and that famous scene of you pistol whipping Mr. Lemon Jack Lemon give us
[1:43:57.760 --> 1:44:19.960]  your take 50 years later on what you really think happened with JFK we had to
[1:44:19.960 --> 1:44:30.360]  go ahead now but Jeff K. the movie showed one thing I've talked I've read
[1:44:30.360 --> 1:44:38.320]  red definitive pieces about the fact that it could have been Oswald the only
[1:44:38.320 --> 1:44:44.080]  thing that never been explained to me is did Oswald indeed in fact kill a
[1:44:44.080 --> 1:44:52.680]  policeman in the movie theater that that's something that I don't have
[1:44:52.680 --> 1:44:57.560]  any answers for well for the full radio audience that didn't hear you earlier
[1:44:57.560 --> 1:45:03.680]  restate it maybe using Bravo Sierra what is your gut level when it happened
[1:45:03.680 --> 1:45:08.960]  versus over the last 50 years and now we have 90 plus percent of Americans in
[1:45:08.960 --> 1:45:12.880]  polls saying they believe it was a government conspiracy I think that shows
[1:45:12.880 --> 1:45:16.720]  America is awake but Ed Azar for the full radio audience what is your take on
[1:45:16.720 --> 1:45:22.880]  JFK 50 years later well I think there were as always we have rogue elements in
[1:45:22.880 --> 1:45:28.880]  our government people have to realize that I feel that about 9-11 I feel rogue
[1:45:28.880 --> 1:45:33.520]  elements only did certain things there and maybe not just rogue elements maybe
[1:45:33.520 --> 1:45:38.720]  they were more official I think there was government complicity in 9-11 I
[1:45:38.720 --> 1:45:44.760]  think it was government complicity in JFK what is your favorite film that you've
[1:45:44.760 --> 1:45:49.600]  ever been in because I was just watching you on screen in JFK what a with
[1:45:49.600 --> 1:45:56.560]  another legend mr. Lemon what are your favorite three films you've ever been
[1:45:56.560 --> 1:46:02.760]  in and who is your favorite actor I love Daniel I love Daniel whether whether
[1:46:02.760 --> 1:46:08.280]  it was fix it or not it was a very interesting take on a little bit of the
[1:46:08.280 --> 1:46:12.900]  budget I loved I love the fact I was a piece of
[1:46:12.900 --> 1:46:20.480]  up and I love to help oh yeah help to me with it was the the bodyist and funniest
[1:46:20.480 --> 1:46:25.640]  and most charming Christmas movie I think and I think it gets really gets
[1:46:25.640 --> 1:46:32.440]  rid of the saccharine miracle on 34th Street well I agree with you that those
[1:46:32.440 --> 1:46:36.280]  are great movies but I got to say some of the serious films you've been in and
[1:46:36.280 --> 1:46:40.800]  some of the stuff you did back in the 40s and 50s and 60s so many times I'm
[1:46:40.800 --> 1:46:45.280]  watching Turner classic movies and I go wow I didn't know Ed Asner was in that
[1:46:45.280 --> 1:46:48.960]  and it's just always really hard to really hard not to watch your buddy and
[1:46:48.960 --> 1:46:53.440]  we appreciate you coming on and spending spending some time with us I
[1:46:53.440 --> 1:47:01.840]  have a lovely time every time but thank you so much Ed Asner thank you sir there
[1:47:01.840 --> 1:47:07.000]  goes Ed Asner what what a living legend what a character and he also has that
[1:47:07.000 --> 1:47:12.520]  great foundation for autistic kids to just search Ed Asner autism and find his
[1:47:12.520 --> 1:47:16.640]  sights on that and all he does for autistic children out there and
[1:47:16.640 --> 1:47:22.840]  exposing the vaccines definitely a real guy and notice how the media distorts who
[1:47:22.840 --> 1:47:28.800]  Ed Asner really is versus versus versus the real versus the real guy and I don't
[1:47:28.800 --> 1:47:32.840]  agree with that on everything but I certainly think he's a good human being
[1:47:32.840 --> 1:47:37.320]  and a really interesting funny living legend I mean who else is on video and
[1:47:37.320 --> 1:47:42.920]  film pistol whipping Jack Lemon I mean it's just awesome you know what we do you

[1:47:51.200 --> 1:47:55.360]  Lemon I mean who doesn't okay I'm now most young people are going to Jack
[1:47:55.360 --> 1:48:01.000]  Lemon who is that is that is is that some guy in the Fast and Furious or
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:05.240]  something okay that's enough you know we got really heavy stuff going on masses

[1:48:21.600 --> 1:48:27.760]  been unfolding with the naval shooting and now there's more dead now they're
[1:48:27.760 --> 1:48:32.240]  reporting six dead maybe more multiple shooters on the run well they lock down

[1:48:36.400 --> 1:48:41.920]  under martial law for three guys like Boston before we go any further we do
[1:48:41.920 --> 1:48:44.560]  want to pray for those that have been injured and for the families of those
[1:48:44.560 --> 1:48:49.160]  that have lost loved ones because it is a tragedy just like death by government's
[1:48:49.160 --> 1:48:52.480]  a tragedy government's the number one killer in history and that's why we're
[1:48:52.480 --> 1:48:56.280]  sick of people like Harry Reid saying government's only good and anybody that
[1:48:56.280 --> 1:49:01.400]  says government isn't inherently good like mommy's milk is a bad I'm sorry
[1:49:01.400 --> 1:49:06.920]  government is not mother's milk it's more like Satan's sting wolf blitzer it's
[1:49:06.920 --> 1:49:12.040]  like the name snake pliskin totally made up what's another fake name like like
[1:49:12.040 --> 1:49:21.120]  Rambo Johnson or Superman Jones I'm sorry PRI products.com ladies and

[1:54:44.440 --> 1:54:48.980]  were in last night on the Sunday show in the last 30 minutes but I wanted to
[1:54:48.980 --> 1:54:52.960]  get them for part of the next hour most the next hour to talk about the Second
[1:54:52.960 --> 1:54:57.720]  Amendment in general and the fact that the police in Texas are arresting people
[1:54:57.720 --> 1:55:03.360]  who have legal firearms on the street saying they feel threatened so we're
[1:55:03.360 --> 1:55:06.840]  going to be looking at this new attack on the Second Amendment that's coming and
[1:55:06.840 --> 1:55:11.840]  make no mistake Obama Sunday came out and said he was getting ready for a new
[1:55:11.840 --> 1:55:17.840]  push to try to get our guns and then magically this happened right now Chris
[1:55:17.840 --> 1:55:22.720]  in Tennessee you were making the point that most bases and most people are
[1:55:22.720 --> 1:55:26.960]  disarmed in fact some bases we've confirmed the MPs aren't allowed to be
[1:55:26.960 --> 1:55:33.320]  armed they have to go back to an armory to check firearms out go ahead yes um
[1:55:33.320 --> 1:55:38.160]  at Fort Campbell the base I'm on post that every day the MPs do have weapons
[1:55:38.160 --> 1:55:42.840]  but besides them the only two guys that I know of that have pistols on their side
[1:55:42.840 --> 1:55:47.360]  as my partner myself and these bases would just be so much safer for our
[1:55:47.360 --> 1:55:50.560]  soldiers if they let them have a sidearm they're trained they know how to use
[1:55:50.560 --> 1:55:54.520]  them and they could stop a wind-up toy if you know somebody says somebody in
[1:55:54.520 --> 1:56:00.880]  there to cut loose well that just shows the nanny state that that they do not
[1:56:00.880 --> 1:56:06.280]  want the soldiers armed because look at Homeland Security they openly say the
[1:56:06.280 --> 1:56:10.280]  number one threat is veterans so they hate you guys of course they don't want
[1:56:10.280 --> 1:56:15.200]  you being armed yeah it's ridiculous I mean the safest place I feel is when
[1:56:15.200 --> 1:56:19.480]  I'm on post when I'm carrying money out of a you know say a Walmart I feel much
[1:56:19.480 --> 1:56:23.120]  more unsafe than when I'm on post because I know it's good people and they
[1:56:23.120 --> 1:56:27.520]  need to be able to protect themselves you're absolutely right appreciate your
[1:56:27.520 --> 1:56:32.240]  call let's go to truth writer in Oregon truth writers on another subject so go
[1:56:32.240 --> 1:56:39.200]  ahead oh Alex this is your terrorist for freedom I've got a couple of subjects
[1:56:39.200 --> 1:56:46.080]  if you have time for it well the the Kim trail phenomenon that we've had for
[1:56:46.080 --> 1:56:50.960]  the past several years the past four weeks we haven't had any what's some
[1:56:50.960 --> 1:56:54.960]  information that you might have found out that what's going on concerning that
[1:56:54.960 --> 1:57:00.480]  and then there's a radio talk show host who when I called in and asked him
[1:57:00.480 --> 1:57:05.840]  about the vehicle code told me that I was a fruitcake and you probably have
[1:57:05.840 --> 1:57:09.880]  heard of him he has a nationally syndicated show called handle on the
[1:57:09.880 --> 1:57:15.120]  law well it is true that they've gotten everything where you don't have your
[1:57:15.120 --> 1:57:21.360]  home's deed your car's deed you get a receipt of title and that's how they've
[1:57:21.360 --> 1:57:26.600]  been able to take people's mortgages and cars and then sell holding that paper
[1:57:26.600 --> 1:57:32.920]  as derivatives and so the average lawyer doesn't even know that type of stuff the
[1:57:32.920 --> 1:57:38.400]  average lawyer specializes in one area one area only and probably doesn't even
[1:57:38.400 --> 1:57:43.600]  know all that sir I appreciate your call let's go ahead and take a another call

[2:00:00.720 --> 2:00:12.600]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[2:00:12.600 --> 2:00:20.120]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas
[2:00:20.120 --> 2:00:23.640]  Alex Jones
[2:00:24.160 --> 2:00:29.720]  well regardless whether this is a real attack or a staged event but who knows
[2:00:29.720 --> 2:00:34.640]  they've staged up before it could be it's a victim disarmament zone where it
[2:00:34.640 --> 2:00:43.280]  took place it gets all of the scandals of Obama including Syria out of the news
[2:00:43.280 --> 2:00:49.640]  and it's exactly what we were predicting would come and Kathy our country's been
[2:00:49.640 --> 2:00:55.360]  eased into martial law for a long time and it's getting more intense all the
[2:00:55.360 --> 2:00:59.840]  time and something big could come up in FEMA region three during these
[2:00:59.840 --> 2:01:05.680]  unprecedented riot police on the streets checkpoints in many areas shutting
[2:01:05.680 --> 2:01:11.920]  the power off seeing if they can turn it back on this is unprecedented but the
[2:01:11.920 --> 2:01:20.640]  I've also seen a lot of rumors flying around so be prepared as always spread
[2:01:20.640 --> 2:01:28.840]  the word but I wouldn't spread speculation and then from that point on if
[2:01:28.840 --> 2:01:35.920]  you just spread the word about the overall federalization of society then
[2:01:35.920 --> 2:01:40.800]  they may not be able to get away with staging something because most people in
[2:01:40.800 --> 2:01:44.760]  the government are not bad it's the centralized globalists that we know are
[2:01:44.760 --> 2:01:49.240]  bad because of their own policies and what they promote and what they what they
[2:01:49.240 --> 2:01:53.680]  demonize so does that answer your question yes it does but they're also
[2:01:53.680 --> 2:01:57.920]  going to be going into Austin Texas at the same time it's not weird you're not
[2:01:57.920 --> 2:02:02.920]  in FEMA region three and I wonder who wins and broadcast from there so I want
[2:02:02.920 --> 2:02:06.720]  to ma'am there are FEMA takeover drills going on basically in any big city all
[2:02:06.720 --> 2:02:13.840]  the time they are federalization drills and they are acclimation drills to then
[2:02:13.840 --> 2:02:20.040]  also announce the drill later after the public sees cars set on fire helicopters
[2:02:20.040 --> 2:02:25.880]  checkpoints later they say oh don't be alarmed that was just a drill so that you
[2:02:25.880 --> 2:02:38.960]  accept the militarization of our society okay there's one more thing to I can't
[2:02:38.960 --> 2:02:42.480]  think I'm sorry it's all right I understand God bless you I appreciate
[2:02:42.480 --> 2:02:47.280]  you calling in that that that FEMA region three and the missing nukes and all of
[2:02:47.280 --> 2:02:52.840]  it is just really really creepy and here's what we know the world is in a
[2:02:52.840 --> 2:02:58.800]  very weird place right now this is a historical time to be alive and a lot is
[2:02:58.800 --> 2:03:04.120]  happening let's go ahead speaking of drills Allen in Florida you're on the
[2:03:04.120 --> 2:03:11.000]  year hi Alex how you doing I want to introduce myself I'm an investigative
[2:03:11.000 --> 2:03:14.000]  journalist with communities at Washington Times and I want to thank the
[2:03:14.000 --> 2:03:18.280]  crew at info wars for breaking one of my stories about six months ago about the
[2:03:18.280 --> 2:03:23.760]  TSA training for a mass shooting scenario at a checkpoint I've also been
[2:03:23.760 --> 2:03:28.800]  covering the FBI shooting in Orlando on the ground I've got some breaking news
[2:03:28.800 --> 2:03:33.920]  on that but I want to bring to your attention that on September 4th the US
[2:03:33.920 --> 2:03:38.320]  Army trained alongside local law enforcement that was Orange County
[2:03:38.320 --> 2:03:44.440]  Sheriff's Department and other police at a University of Central Florida
[2:03:44.440 --> 2:03:49.640]  simulation and training Center and that's a Institute for training and
[2:03:49.640 --> 2:03:54.360]  simulation National Center for simulation they've got Army Marines
[2:03:54.360 --> 2:03:58.440]  DARPA contracts they do these high-tech simulations and they did one with
[2:03:58.440 --> 2:04:05.600]  shootings and explosions on the fourth what they're doing is even though
[2:04:05.600 --> 2:04:09.600]  statistically one of the rarest forms of death is mass shootings again less than
[2:04:09.600 --> 2:04:17.040]  30 a year from actual mass shootings at 60 something if you count gang related
[2:04:17.040 --> 2:04:22.600]  stuff I mean honeybees kill hundreds but our whole society is being changed and
[2:04:22.600 --> 2:04:28.000]  re-engineered into a tyranny in the name of keeping you safe so that no mass
[2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:33.320]  shooter can ever hurt anyone you're not gonna stop a crazy person from killing
[2:04:33.320 --> 2:04:38.480]  people all you can do is make sure other people who want to be armed or armed so
[2:04:38.480 --> 2:04:43.440]  that they can protect themselves their loved ones and those around them that is
[2:04:43.440 --> 2:04:47.240]  the answer more good guys with guns the counter bad guys with guns and it's
[2:04:47.240 --> 2:04:52.120]  elementary but we better get that news out now we've got all these points made

[2:08:59.520 --> 2:09:19.520]  in the U.S. Kurt Nemo asked that question we have a continually updated section on the six dead and mass shooting in Navy Yard to government still at large that Paul Watson story that he's continuing to update we've also got Navy Yard shooting right on time gun control advocates blame AR 15's
[2:09:19.520 --> 2:09:37.520]  this happens one day after Obama starts a new anti second amendment push also Navy Yard shelter in place order leaves victims sitting ducks Steve Watson asked the same question Navy Yard shooting did gun free zone enable the killer we're going to discuss that with some second amendment
[2:09:37.520 --> 2:09:59.520]  advocates and activist here in just a moment some of the other news that isn't as sensational as the establishment press pushing tyranny on the backs of the six dead there in DC rain slows rescue efforts among 1200 plus people missing and they fear that hundreds
[2:09:59.520 --> 2:10:13.520]  could be dead in Colorado all we need I guess is an ATF to restrict the rain my point is the establishment cannot protect you and historically won't protect you and any big government that's been set up in history
[2:10:13.520 --> 2:10:34.520]  ends up becoming oppressive because why wouldn't a big powerful group that's ruthless not make you a slave continuing ABC news reports typhoon man I hits man I hits Japan raising fears about Fukushima nuclear plant that's already in the process of having multiple continued meltdowns
[2:10:34.520 --> 2:10:54.520]  and is already flooded so it's the tsunami last time that caused this to happen to begin with so this is a big big big deal ladies and gentlemen RT also reports crippled Fukushima braces for typhoon man I to hit again very serious situation
[2:10:54.520 --> 2:11:09.520]  some good news hounded by criticism Larry Summers calls up for the Fed chairman job he's the man is Treasury Secretary under Clinton who helped engineer the current banking crisis were in and there are a lot of people are involved but he was in the catbird seat
[2:11:09.520 --> 2:11:29.520]  also amid slow economic recovery more Americans identified as lower class yes more Americans are either the working poor or going on welfare food stamps 101 a million Americans on some form of food assistance talk about domestication big government is doing a great job at the permanent peasant class
[2:11:29.520 --> 2:11:42.520]  now they just got a disarmus and our journey to slavery is complete they already control and run our kids in the public schools we also have a new video up on prison planet dot com some news is only on prison planet dot com on info wars dot com
[2:11:42.520 --> 2:11:51.520]  Obama supporters signed petition to ban gold coins a new mark dice video they say they should be confiscated and given to Obama.
[2:11:51.520 --> 2:12:05.520]  Again if you tell people we should take the guns we should kill the conservatives we should we should force abortions if it's for Obama people in LA where mark dice does the sign it they also do it in Austin in trendy areas.
[2:12:05.520 --> 2:12:13.520]  You could say we're gonna put your baby in a meat grinder for Obama they would sign it I'm not joking we're gonna ban water for Obama they do I talk about cult members.
[2:12:13.520 --> 2:12:23.520]  It's like false of doom and Conan the barbarian come to me come to me my child and she jumps off the jumps off the cliff right down to the ground and bounces.
[2:12:23.520 --> 2:12:27.520]  Steel isn't strong boy flesh is strong.
[2:12:27.520 --> 2:12:31.520]  We have to tell the state troopers that they don't need their guns anymore if you don't.
[2:12:31.520 --> 2:12:42.520]  Also I want to get to this later I may not I may shoot a special video on this I'm going to be doing the nightly news tonight in the commentary section so 25 facts about the Federal Reserve very important for Michael Schneider.
[2:12:42.520 --> 2:12:52.520]  Up on info wars dot com let's get that out to everybody top climate scientists admit global warming forecast we're wrong the earth is cooling a giant victory.
[2:12:52.520 --> 2:13:07.520]  I thought Al Gore said we were evil to say such things again abortion clinics closing at record rate Christian today that very that upsets the federal government that funds most of them because you know they're they're they're anti racist is why they want to abort all the black babies.
[2:13:07.520 --> 2:13:17.520]  And Israel commits to ending water fluoridation by 2014 citing major health concerns so they officially have voted to remove the fluoride by next year.
[2:13:17.520 --> 2:13:25.520]  But not us we're going to get it and your conspiracy theorists that that's the Knesset voted their their Congress their parliament.
[2:13:25.520 --> 2:13:38.520]  CVS pharmacies caught lying about risk of high dose flu vaccines pushed onto senior citizens with aggressive bribery schemes.
[2:13:38.520 --> 2:13:56.520]  Up on info wars dot com and kind of a weird piece of news NASA probe here's streak in space as it leaves solar system.
[2:13:56.520 --> 2:14:15.520]  It's like crickets out there and aluminum airship of the future has finally flown wild looking thing looks like science fiction I guess we are in 2013 it's aluminum hold and thank God it's not run by hydrogen
[2:14:15.520 --> 2:14:31.520]  but it's run by helium so won't go down like the Hennenberg but it doesn't matter that they had helium then it could have gone to it airships ended because of the fear just like it was very safe to go on airships even with hydrogen on average statistically extremely safe with helium
[2:14:31.520 --> 2:14:44.520]  people still won't get on them to this day worldwide because of the Hennenberg same thing with gun statistics statistically it's one of the rarest forms of death to be killed by a criminal with a gunner and a mass shooting look at the numbers.
[2:14:44.520 --> 2:14:56.520]  We covered the LA Times article admitting gun crime plunges but the public thinks it's up because of the media engaged in brainwashing they know that but they're hyping it.
[2:14:56.520 --> 2:15:04.520]  Now that's just some of the news we have huge news on Obamacare just imploding but still moving forward like a juggernaut.
[2:15:04.520 --> 2:15:17.520]  It's kind of like a bowling ball dropped off a building it's falling to its destruction but it may hit you in the head first and then we're going to get into Chinese broadcast confession of Chinese American blogger and Hayden the former head of the NSA is pleased.
[2:15:17.520 --> 2:15:22.520]  He says he wants Chinese style internet censorship here in the United States.
[2:15:22.520 --> 2:15:38.520]  That's an info wars dot com article up at drudge report dot com and the man in charge of the NSA currently modeled his bridge after the enterprise that shows what fruit loops these people are but Google's Eric Schmidt says the government spying is the nature of our society.
[2:15:38.520 --> 2:15:48.520]  But he pays with cash is very secretive and has girlfriends wear bags over their heads like Michael Jackson has his kids because he's so obsessed with his privacy.
[2:15:48.520 --> 2:15:53.520]  I mean what a piece of trash man I tell you these hypocrites are amazing.
[2:15:53.520 --> 2:16:05.520]  Now for the balance of the hour we are joined here by folks we had on for a couple segments last night I wanted to have them back on the second amendment.
[2:16:05.520 --> 2:16:23.520]  The gentleman we have in here with us Terry Holcomb was arrested Friday jacari Jackson shot the video went viral and was picked up even by national news because he had a black powder gun, which was absolutely not illegal to open carry but the police admitted they knew it was legal and said we are alarmed.
[2:16:23.520 --> 2:16:41.520]  Even though this was supposed to be part of the Texas Historical Society event. The police said we choose not to have him here with it, even though he's a board member of Texas open carry and Rachel Malone is a Farms freedom activist and as a legislative director of Texas freedoms.
[2:16:41.520 --> 2:16:53.520]  Texas Farms freedom.com a group dedicated to the preservation and protection of the second amendment rights and folks they've got we're going to tell you about this after we cover the shooting today.
[2:16:53.520 --> 2:16:57.520]  What happened to them over the weekend a veteran a wheelchair being arrested we have that video.
[2:16:57.520 --> 2:17:16.520]  We're going to go back to something historic the 19th of October, and I intend to be there or have a reporter there bare minimum. They're going to have reportedly it's estimated 1200 or more, maybe 2000 members of open carry groups are going to be open carrying in front of the Alamo.
[2:17:16.520 --> 2:17:32.520]  I had to claim that's illegal down in San Antonio but you guys have the Land Commissioner on your side who controls the jurisdiction of the Alamo to the daughters of the Republic of Texas, which my grandma's part of so it's good to have you guys here with us we're going to break in a few minutes.
[2:17:32.520 --> 2:17:47.520]  We're going to skip this network break to catch up on time because there's nothing more important than us not being disarmed slaves, talking to you first Terry and then Rachel who didn't get a lot of time to speak yesterday.
[2:17:47.520 --> 2:17:56.520]  What is your take on what happened today in that victim disarmament zone on that base where contrary to proper belief, the military wasn't allowed to be armed, because the bureaucrats can't trust them.
[2:17:56.520 --> 2:18:06.520]  It's a good thing people weren't armed so they had to get the police there. They said that wasn't terror related I think this will end up being terror related, but just like the Florida shooting they won't say it is.
[2:18:06.520 --> 2:18:20.520]  What is your take on that I mean this is the reason for open carry. Here is for listeners we can show them on document cam. Here is the Los Angeles Times gun crime is plunged, but Americans think it's up study says, at least 49%.
[2:18:20.520 --> 2:18:31.520]  That's on the low end criminals using guns since 1992, because gun ownership has gone up. That's admitted university studies University of Chicago and others.
[2:18:31.520 --> 2:18:35.520]  What is your take on what happened today and then I'm going to get Rachel's take on that.
[2:18:35.520 --> 2:18:45.520]  Well just today is just more example of what happens in gun free zones. If this was truly a gun gun free zone and I haven't gotten all the facts on it yet.
[2:18:45.520 --> 2:18:56.520]  Partially gun free only police can have guns and we know how that goes but I mean I believe that is the intent of our government is to create a gun free society so that only them and the criminals can have them.
[2:18:56.520 --> 2:19:03.520]  Facts aren't relevant to the left facts aren't relevant to this administration facts aren't relevant to anyone that wants to take our rights.
[2:19:03.520 --> 2:19:07.520]  They don't look at the facts and the fact is this is a gun free zone.
[2:19:07.520 --> 2:19:14.520]  And the only ones that allowed to happen in police and yet we still have six people that have been killed maybe more we don't know what all the facts are.
[2:19:14.520 --> 2:19:21.520]  Propaganda is very powerful and people need to quit paying attention to the mainstream media because all that is this false propaganda.
[2:19:21.520 --> 2:19:26.520]  Every national study people believe that there's an epidemic of mass shootings and an epidemic of gun crime.
[2:19:26.520 --> 2:19:28.520]  And that has to come from propaganda.
[2:19:28.520 --> 2:19:30.520]  It's the opposite.
[2:19:30.520 --> 2:19:31.520]  Absolutely.
[2:19:31.520 --> 2:19:35.520]  The facts the true facts the true data say a very different story.
[2:19:35.520 --> 2:19:42.520]  All the mass shootings in the last 60 years except for one is happening in a gun free zone but nobody likes to talk about that fact that's a fact.
[2:19:42.520 --> 2:19:55.520]  And people need to start paying attention to what's really happening and how it's really happening and go out there and get the right information and don't trust the mainstream media and quite frankly don't trust your government because they're not telling you the truth.
[2:19:55.520 --> 2:20:10.520]  Now that sounds like something the founder said and I'm sure you did you see three weeks ago two and a half weeks ago the Department of Defense put out their official training manual for even privates and it says the founding fathers including George Washington would not be welcome in today's army.
[2:20:10.520 --> 2:20:12.520]  Oh there's no question about that.
[2:20:12.520 --> 2:20:14.520]  No they would be considered terrorist.
[2:20:14.520 --> 2:20:18.520]  And I'm very sure many probably consider all freedom loving Americans.
[2:20:18.520 --> 2:20:22.520]  Terrorist as we've been labeled by this occur in administration.
[2:20:22.520 --> 2:20:30.520]  What is your what is your take on on this Rachel Malone legislative director for the pro-gun group here in Texas.
[2:20:30.520 --> 2:20:32.520]  I think we need to take away from the story.
[2:20:32.520 --> 2:20:36.520]  The fact that the government law enforcement is not their responsibility to protect us.
[2:20:36.520 --> 2:20:40.520]  In fact even if they truly wanted to and sincerely wanted to they couldn't.
[2:20:40.520 --> 2:20:42.520]  There is no way and it's not the responsibility.
[2:20:42.520 --> 2:20:48.520]  It is our responsibility as American citizens and our right to self defense.
[2:20:48.520 --> 2:20:50.520]  That's right for those that don't know under common law thousands of years.
[2:20:50.520 --> 2:20:58.520]  It's not the police's job or the magistrates job to go out and protect people unless they consciously know something's about to be committed.
[2:20:58.520 --> 2:21:02.520]  It's their job to bring you to trial to the people to the jury.
[2:21:02.520 --> 2:21:06.520]  It is not their job to sit there and keep you safe.
[2:21:06.520 --> 2:21:08.520]  That is the opposite of what they're supposed to do.
[2:21:08.520 --> 2:21:10.520]  They're supposed to keep your liberty safe.
[2:21:10.520 --> 2:21:14.520]  Yes I think that's a huge misunderstanding that Americans have today.
[2:21:14.520 --> 2:21:20.520]  It's part of the entitlement state where we believe that the government owes us everything and so we start counting on the government for that.
[2:21:20.520 --> 2:21:22.520]  It's not their responsibility.
[2:21:22.520 --> 2:21:26.520]  It's our responsibility and right to defend ourselves and our communities.
[2:21:26.520 --> 2:21:36.520]  There are some exceptions on my website on Texasfirearmsfreedom.com just listing out facts of not only the history of the Second Amendment and the right to keep and bear arms, the right to self defense, but also how guns work.
[2:21:36.520 --> 2:21:46.520]  Statistics on exactly showing on your screen right now on guns in America and how effective it is when citizens have the right and take the responsibility upon themselves of defending themselves.
[2:21:46.520 --> 2:21:48.520]  Go over some of those statistics.
[2:21:48.520 --> 2:21:54.520]  I mean because you show the graph but visualize how often guns are used to stop crime versus in crime.
[2:21:54.520 --> 2:21:56.520]  I mean it is simply amazing.
[2:21:56.520 --> 2:22:02.520]  Right well I think you can you can see on the screens of how guns are being used by citizens.
[2:22:02.520 --> 2:22:14.520]  It's very interesting to see graphically on that display there how many times guns are used in self defense versus the small amount of time that they're actually.
[2:22:14.520 --> 2:22:20.520]  I used to go off the Justice Department's number of like 24 times but now the new numbers are 80 times more often.
[2:22:20.520 --> 2:22:23.520]  It's used to stop crime than it's used in a crime.
[2:22:23.520 --> 2:22:29.520]  Right and if you look at the effectiveness of citizens defending themselves versus police officers, citizens have a much better track record.
[2:22:29.520 --> 2:22:38.520]  I think if you scroll a little farther down you can see the rate of hitting an innocent bystander much worse than the police record than on the citizens record.
[2:22:38.520 --> 2:22:45.520]  Well you know why the cops have more engagements so they're going to have a much lower statistic because they're constantly in and around things.
[2:22:45.520 --> 2:22:51.520]  But generally when a citizen goes ahead and pulls the trigger somebody's busted down their front door, somebody's trying to carjack them.
[2:22:51.520 --> 2:22:56.520]  You're right there. The guy's assaulting you. Boom. I mean that's why you're going to have better numbers.
[2:22:56.520 --> 2:23:01.520]  Right I mean it's amazing. I was very surprised when I first went and looked and took a look at the numbers.
[2:23:01.520 --> 2:23:06.520]  You might not believe this but about five years ago I would never have sat here and told you these things. I didn't know them.
[2:23:06.520 --> 2:23:14.520]  I was not anti-gun. I just didn't know any of this. Didn't really think it was effective for citizens to carry guns to defend themselves.
[2:23:14.520 --> 2:23:20.520]  Well that's another issue. It's not just the heritage or how America was founded or the fact that slaves are disarmed.
[2:23:20.520 --> 2:23:28.520]  Once you discover and once you find out that it's the opposite of what they're saying and that any time they take our guns a tyranny is set up
[2:23:28.520 --> 2:23:34.520]  and then once you learn that they know guns are making us safer and want us to live like D.C. and New York and Chicago
[2:23:34.520 --> 2:23:37.520]  it makes you mad and you want to tell people.
[2:23:37.520 --> 2:23:43.520]  Right and so when I went and looked at the facts with a very open mind actually almost trying to prove the other side
[2:23:43.520 --> 2:23:49.520]  I realized just how effective it is what a right and responsibility we have and how important it is for us to keep that liberty.
[2:23:49.520 --> 2:23:55.520]  And that's why I think stories like the stories come out today, the stories that happened in Texas this past weekend with Terry getting arrested
[2:23:55.520 --> 2:24:01.520]  it's important for us to see those and realize this liberty is being infringed and we must not sit back and watch it being infringed.
[2:24:01.520 --> 2:24:05.520]  We must not wait for anybody else to take action. We must step forward as citizens.
[2:24:05.520 --> 2:24:12.520]  Now I never aired the videos yesterday in the audio. Most of our audience's radio probably 95% of it.
[2:24:12.520 --> 2:24:20.520]  We send out video streams at prisonplanet.tv members and later it's put on YouTube. But for the main radio audience we should probably repost that article.
[2:24:20.520 --> 2:24:28.520]  You have the same article that's been up since yesterday to infowars.com to the top of the page so that everybody can go see these videos.
[2:24:28.520 --> 2:24:34.520]  And then I want to get into the whole Alamo situation coming up and then take phone calls for folks that are calling in about what's happening.
[2:24:34.520 --> 2:24:43.520]  Alex in Kentucky on shooting and ammo shortages. JD and California friend got caught up in ATF sweep. We're going to go to Burton, Texas.
[2:24:43.520 --> 2:24:50.520]  Dove Hunters near school. Arrested. Gary in Texas. Arrested at Capitol Friday. So is that the fellow who was in the wheelchair?
[2:24:50.520 --> 2:24:53.520]  And one other guy got arrested too. Do you know Gary up there?
[2:24:53.520 --> 2:24:54.520]  Yes, sir.
[2:24:54.520 --> 2:24:59.520]  So we're going to go to Gary actually first here in just a moment. Then we'll go to Alan and others.
[2:24:59.520 --> 2:25:05.520]  We've actually already talked to Alan. So thank you for the call Alan and your info there from Florida.
[2:25:05.520 --> 2:25:13.520]  But right now let's get into what happened to you for those that don't know on Friday and why this is such a big deal.
[2:25:13.520 --> 2:25:18.520]  I'll keep it as brief as I can so we can move this along to the Alamo event.
[2:25:18.520 --> 2:25:27.520]  We had set up with the Texas State Preservation Board and the leaders of the DPS State Capitol Police to have a very small event.
[2:25:27.520 --> 2:25:32.520]  We had originally wanted to go inside. They didn't want to let us inside.
[2:25:32.520 --> 2:25:35.520]  They don't believe that openly carry armed citizens are safe.
[2:25:35.520 --> 2:25:38.520]  So I think the Texas Capitol should be a big gun.
[2:25:38.520 --> 2:25:44.520]  It should be the place that is the most free to carry in. Absolutely.
[2:25:44.520 --> 2:25:48.520]  But we went ahead and agreed that we would have our event outside.
[2:25:48.520 --> 2:25:52.520]  They agreed with us to allow us to have it outside on Friday.
[2:25:52.520 --> 2:25:58.520]  So I showed up and we parked and I didn't get one block. Three DPS officers were waiting on me.
[2:25:58.520 --> 2:26:03.520]  They had 50, 60 DPS officers spread out everywhere. They set us up is what it amounts to.
[2:26:03.520 --> 2:26:08.520]  And they intentionally targeted me to arrest me. There's no question about it.
[2:26:08.520 --> 2:26:13.520]  Before I was ever able to get to the Capitol, I would stop three times by three different officers.
[2:26:13.520 --> 2:26:17.520]  Now had you telegraphed that you were planning to carry a black powder pistol?
[2:26:17.520 --> 2:26:18.520]  No.
[2:26:18.520 --> 2:26:23.520]  Well, you know they tap into the NSA. That's on record that local police even do that now.
[2:26:23.520 --> 2:26:26.520]  I think there's an NSA issue here. This is very illegal.
[2:26:26.520 --> 2:26:32.520]  According to the NSA, it may be. But according to the Constitution, Texas Constitution and the state laws, it's very legal.
[2:26:32.520 --> 2:26:36.520]  One of the biggest... No, no, no, no. I'm saying it's illegal that they were spying on you
[2:26:36.520 --> 2:26:39.520]  and knew that you were planning to bring a handgun, as they call it.
[2:26:39.520 --> 2:26:47.520]  Absolutely. I think one of the things that people really need to pay attention to is law enforcement is making up their own laws.
[2:26:47.520 --> 2:26:54.520]  We had given them the statute. They read it. They didn't care. The law did not matter.
[2:26:54.520 --> 2:26:59.520]  That's like the NSA. It's illegal. Torture is illegal. Secret arrest is illegal. They still do it.
[2:26:59.520 --> 2:27:08.520]  Absolutely. And I think people are not paying attention. I think unless it hits on their front door, they don't understand that it's real.
[2:27:08.520 --> 2:27:13.520]  I'm not quite sure. I understood just how real it was until I experienced what I just experienced.
[2:27:13.520 --> 2:27:18.520]  And if it's going to happen to me, it's going to happen to all of us at some point.
[2:27:18.520 --> 2:27:25.520]  Well, it's a monopoly of force. The government doesn't want its food armed. That's a lot harder to catch and feed on.
[2:27:25.520 --> 2:27:31.520]  And of course, you're a board member of Texas Open Carry, but you're also a pastor, a guy with no criminal record.
[2:27:31.520 --> 2:27:36.520]  How did you start now to go down this path where you're an evil, evil extremist?
[2:27:36.520 --> 2:27:43.520]  Well, with me being a pastor, the left of the liberal forces has tapped into them.
[2:27:43.520 --> 2:27:45.520]  They're not liberals. Authoritarians.
[2:27:45.520 --> 2:27:51.520]  Authoritarians definitely don't want their pastors believing in the First or Second or Fourth Amendments.
[2:27:51.520 --> 2:28:00.520]  They believe we should be sheep, that we should succumb to whatever they tell us to, in the name of peace, love, hope, and joy, and whether we like it or not.
[2:28:00.520 --> 2:28:06.520]  And, you know, I believe it's a pastor's responsibility to tell the truth.
[2:28:06.520 --> 2:28:09.520]  And the truth of the matter is, once they take our second, they take our first.
[2:28:09.520 --> 2:28:12.520]  And when they take our first, they take our freedom of religion.
[2:28:12.520 --> 2:28:16.520]  Once they take our first, they take the freedom of me being able to preach the true Word of God.
[2:28:16.520 --> 2:28:18.520]  They would want me to preach their version.
[2:28:18.520 --> 2:28:22.520]  And so it's a snowball effect. And as a pastor, I'm going to stand on the second.
[2:28:22.520 --> 2:28:29.520]  They want, it defends all the rest as you know, they want to make the state God.
[2:28:29.520 --> 2:28:33.520]  They say that everything else is evil, the family, men, women.
[2:28:33.520 --> 2:28:38.520]  Everything's got to be changed so that we're all homogenized and they can control us.
[2:28:38.520 --> 2:28:44.520]  And our current president was speaking directly to me when he says they cling to their guns and religions.
[2:28:44.520 --> 2:28:47.520]  He has no idea how much I cling to both.
[2:28:47.520 --> 2:28:50.520]  I can't imagine what it's like because I don't live in fear.
[2:28:50.520 --> 2:28:52.520]  People say, oh, why do you have guns? You must be fearful.
[2:28:52.520 --> 2:28:57.520]  It's the opposite. I love being in a neighborhood where everybody's armed and I can look at the crime maps.
[2:28:57.520 --> 2:29:00.520]  It's literally like no crime because the criminals are all scared to death.
[2:29:00.520 --> 2:29:02.520]  I live out in the countryside.
[2:29:02.520 --> 2:29:03.520]  Absolutely.
[2:29:03.520 --> 2:29:07.520]  I mean, it's so good that I'm red-blooded and you know what, even I didn't have a gun.
[2:29:07.520 --> 2:29:09.520]  My dad brought me up to not back down.
[2:29:09.520 --> 2:29:13.520]  I've been in quite a few fights. I'm not proud of getting in fights, but I'm proud that I can stand up for myself.
[2:29:13.520 --> 2:29:16.520]  I can't imagine what it must be like to be brought up to be a coward.
[2:29:16.520 --> 2:29:20.520]  And if somebody comes to attack you, you just get on the ground in a fetal position.
[2:29:20.520 --> 2:29:21.520]  And that's what they expect you to do.
[2:29:21.520 --> 2:29:26.520]  They expect you to either play dead or ask them nicely to leave and somehow they're going to adhere to that.
[2:29:26.520 --> 2:29:32.520]  I think it's also important to note that there's a very specific reason that they want to take our guns.
[2:29:32.520 --> 2:29:34.520]  And I don't think people understand that.
[2:29:34.520 --> 2:29:36.520]  Tell us the specific reason when we come back.
[2:29:36.520 --> 2:29:41.520]  Then we'll go to Gary, who got in, who you know, who was the fella in the wheelchair, correct?
[2:29:41.520 --> 2:29:44.520]  That's correct. He is the veteran in the wheelchair.
[2:29:44.520 --> 2:29:46.520]  Don't worry. He was arrested, though, folks.
[2:29:46.520 --> 2:29:49.520]  Don't worry. He's off the streets now.
[2:29:49.520 --> 2:29:53.520]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.

[2:33:00.520 --> 2:33:07.520]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[2:33:07.520 --> 2:33:14.520]  It's not about keeping guns out of the hands of law-abiding Americans, and I'm sick and tired of people lying to the American people.
[2:33:14.520 --> 2:33:18.520]  We can't have a totally armed society.
[2:33:18.520 --> 2:33:23.520]  We're not proposing a gun registration system. We're proposing background checks for criminals.
[2:33:23.520 --> 2:33:27.520]  In the spirit of gun control, will you disarm your entire security team?
[2:33:27.520 --> 2:33:30.520]  Uh, we'll get right back to you.
[2:33:30.520 --> 2:33:31.520]  You'll get back to me?
[2:33:31.520 --> 2:33:36.520]  Hitler took the guns, Stalin took the guns, Mao took the guns, and El Castro took the guns.
[2:33:36.520 --> 2:33:43.520]  Hugo Chavez took the guns, and I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[2:33:43.520 --> 2:33:47.520]  It doesn't matter how many lemmings you get out there on the street begging for them to have their guns taken.
[2:33:47.520 --> 2:33:50.520]  We will not relinquish them. Do you understand?
[2:33:50.520 --> 2:33:55.520]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[2:33:55.520 --> 2:33:59.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:33:59.520 --> 2:34:25.520]  Music plays.
[2:34:25.520 --> 2:34:30.520]  Read that in the L.A. Times.
[2:34:30.520 --> 2:34:34.520]  It's also been covered by Forbes, and we basically hammered it for months after the report came out earlier this year,
[2:34:34.520 --> 2:34:38.520]  until what you'd call mainstream media began to finally cover it.
[2:34:38.520 --> 2:34:43.520]  We the people are the media, and when we see things that are wrong, when we see things that are going on,
[2:34:43.520 --> 2:34:51.520]  it's up to us to point it out and not leave it to the, quote, experts and specialists who nine times out of ten have been bought and paid for.
[2:34:51.520 --> 2:34:58.520]  It is time for the real media, we the people, to take action and to get involved like my two guests have done.
[2:34:58.520 --> 2:35:05.520]  Now, we have on the line, we've confirmed it's him, we have Gary Hayes, who was also arrested this weekend,
[2:35:05.520 --> 2:35:12.520]  a wheelchair-bound veteran for having a black powder handgun, I'm told.
[2:35:12.520 --> 2:35:18.520]  But we'll get the specifics of that, and more and more people, thousands, are planning to show up at the Alamo,
[2:35:18.520 --> 2:35:21.520]  where the police have told them they're going to arrest them.
[2:35:21.520 --> 2:35:27.520]  So a showdown there, ladies and gentlemen, of historical and biblical proportions.
[2:35:27.520 --> 2:35:33.520]  But the good news is, the Land Commissioner is trying to block the police from violating the law.
[2:35:33.520 --> 2:35:38.520]  But what's creepy is that they were at a meeting with the state police last week before this happened,
[2:35:38.520 --> 2:35:42.520]  and they said, well, you'd be alarmed having teachers armed in schools.
[2:35:42.520 --> 2:35:45.520]  It's alarming to have anybody with a gun but us.
[2:35:45.520 --> 2:35:49.520]  And I tell you, the state troopers, I used to know a lot of them, and I still know some.
[2:35:49.520 --> 2:35:51.520]  Until about 10 years ago, they were completely different.
[2:35:51.520 --> 2:35:54.520]  It is like they're hiring them out of San Francisco or something.
[2:35:54.520 --> 2:35:58.520]  I mean, it is creepy, creepy.
[2:35:58.520 --> 2:36:00.520]  And they've said they're going to make Texas a blue state.
[2:36:00.520 --> 2:36:03.520]  And I'm not even for the Republicans either, because they're a bunch of rhinos.
[2:36:03.520 --> 2:36:08.520]  But man, I'm telling you folks, they're bragging on seeing in that they've got Texas.
[2:36:08.520 --> 2:36:15.520]  And I think they may, I think they may, because, I mean, this country isn't so much trouble.
[2:36:15.520 --> 2:36:18.520]  And they've imploded California, so they're all running here.
[2:36:18.520 --> 2:36:22.520]  I know a lot of good Californians, but a lot of Californians don't know why they lost their job.
[2:36:22.520 --> 2:36:24.520]  They don't know why they've been forced to come here.
[2:36:24.520 --> 2:36:28.520]  They still want to come here and tell my wife you shouldn't have three kids at the store.
[2:36:28.520 --> 2:36:30.520]  That happens very routinely.
[2:36:30.520 --> 2:36:33.520]  Tell my wife you shouldn't have paper bags, you know, when you leave the store.
[2:36:33.520 --> 2:36:35.520]  Tell us we shouldn't drive an SUV.
[2:36:35.520 --> 2:36:37.520]  What are we supposed to stick our kids in?
[2:36:37.520 --> 2:36:41.520]  You know, one of your little attend cans so they statistically get killed on the road.
[2:36:41.520 --> 2:36:43.520]  It's amazing what this country's turned into.
[2:36:43.520 --> 2:36:47.520]  So we're going to go back to them and your phone calls here in a moment and talk about the Alamo event.
[2:36:47.520 --> 2:36:53.520]  But first, some of our great sponsors, there's some real scum in the alarm industry.

[2:38:59.520 --> 2:39:06.520]  Now, going back into the bad news, and this is just like Sandy Hook,
[2:39:06.520 --> 2:39:12.520]  the number just gets bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger.
[2:39:12.520 --> 2:39:18.520]  And we've looked it up and found military personnel complaining on blogs
[2:39:18.520 --> 2:39:25.520]  about a very draconian anti-gun policy on the base that only MPs and private security
[2:39:25.520 --> 2:39:28.520]  could have firearms on this giant DC compound.
[2:39:28.520 --> 2:39:30.520]  I mean, no kidding, it's in DC.
[2:39:30.520 --> 2:39:34.520]  And we have confirmed, and I've got Kit Daniels working on it,
[2:39:34.520 --> 2:39:45.520]  and I didn't know about this with the Law Enforcement Safety Act of 2004 expanded in 010.
[2:39:45.520 --> 2:39:50.520]  I didn't know that base commanders had been outside of law nixing that,
[2:39:50.520 --> 2:39:55.520]  and that a new law passed last year, no, no, this year, 2013,
[2:39:55.520 --> 2:40:00.520]  a writer on the National Defense Authorization Act ordered the commanders to stop doing it
[2:40:00.520 --> 2:40:06.520]  and said anybody who is in army security or any other military security
[2:40:06.520 --> 2:40:12.520]  or any type of other specialist or any retired former specialist in security
[2:40:12.520 --> 2:40:14.520]  can be armed on bases.
[2:40:14.520 --> 2:40:15.520]  That's bare minimum.
[2:40:15.520 --> 2:40:19.520]  We trust our military to fight for our supposed country, but they can't be armed.
[2:40:19.520 --> 2:40:20.520]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[2:40:20.520 --> 2:40:23.520]  And for me, this is a big scandal.
[2:40:23.520 --> 2:40:26.520]  We're going to be covering on the nightly news tonight while the documentation.
[2:40:26.520 --> 2:40:29.520]  But I am seeing people saying that that was the policy on the base.
[2:40:29.520 --> 2:40:33.520]  We've got to confirm that and nail that down, but that's big news here,
[2:40:33.520 --> 2:40:38.520]  because every mass shooting but one in the last few decades has been on victim disarmament facilities.
[2:40:38.520 --> 2:40:42.520]  If you can't trust pilots to be armed, if you can't trust the army to be armed,
[2:40:42.520 --> 2:40:43.520]  who do you trust to be armed?
[2:40:43.520 --> 2:40:46.520]  I mean, this is really getting to be ridiculous.
[2:40:46.520 --> 2:40:49.520]  A pilot could fly that plane right into a building.
[2:40:49.520 --> 2:40:54.520]  Now, I've been ranting, breaking that down, but 12 dead in Navy Yard shootings,
[2:40:54.520 --> 2:41:01.520]  one suspect dead manhunt underway, will they find him in a nearby city and shut down maybe DC,
[2:41:01.520 --> 2:41:07.520]  maybe Baltimore, maybe shut the whole country down and search all our houses like Boston.
[2:41:07.520 --> 2:41:11.520]  And notice this keeps happening in disarmed big government areas.
[2:41:11.520 --> 2:41:17.520]  Now, going back to Terry Holcomb and Rachel Malone, who are here with TexasFarmsFreedom.com,
[2:41:17.520 --> 2:41:22.520]  and Terry is a board member with Texas Open Carry, who was arrested Friday.
[2:41:22.520 --> 2:41:25.520]  We're going to get into the big open carry coming up and go to calls,
[2:41:25.520 --> 2:41:28.520]  but I want to bring up right now, Gary Hayes,
[2:41:28.520 --> 2:41:30.520]  and we're going to show some of that video for TV viewers.
[2:41:30.520 --> 2:41:34.520]  If you're a radio listener, go to infowords.com forward slash show.
[2:41:34.520 --> 2:41:37.520]  You can see the free video feed right there on the site.
[2:41:37.520 --> 2:41:41.520]  And you can see the veteran right there before we go to him.
[2:41:41.520 --> 2:41:43.520]  Tell us about Gary Hayes.
[2:41:43.520 --> 2:41:51.520]  We know you got arrested outside the Capitol grounds with a black powder bowling cap handgun.
[2:41:51.520 --> 2:41:53.520]  And they admitted it was legal.
[2:41:53.520 --> 2:41:54.520]  They didn't care.
[2:41:54.520 --> 2:41:55.520]  They're God.
[2:41:55.520 --> 2:41:56.520]  Tell us what happened to him.
[2:41:56.520 --> 2:41:57.520]  And then we're going to go to him.
[2:41:57.520 --> 2:42:04.520]  Actually, he had gotten word that some of his fellow patrons myself and another gentleman had been arrested.
[2:42:04.520 --> 2:42:06.520]  And, you know, he, of course, he's a war veteran.
[2:42:06.520 --> 2:42:09.520]  And so he decided to come down and defend us.
[2:42:09.520 --> 2:42:12.520]  He come down and decided to take a stand.
[2:42:12.520 --> 2:42:15.520]  And he brought his black powder pistol down.
[2:42:15.520 --> 2:42:24.520]  And, of course, DPS continued to make up the law and decided to arrest a second war veteran and this one, a paraplegic.
[2:42:24.520 --> 2:42:30.520]  And they ended up releasing him oddly enough without any charges or anything like that.
[2:42:30.520 --> 2:42:34.520]  But we're just getting word today that it looks like they're going to go ahead and press charges on him.
[2:42:34.520 --> 2:42:37.520]  So he may be able to confirm that more than we can.
[2:42:37.520 --> 2:42:38.520]  That's right.
[2:42:38.520 --> 2:42:40.520]  They've got to do that because they know there's no law.
[2:42:40.520 --> 2:42:46.520]  So they've got to falsify it and I guess say that it's a firearm because people don't know.
[2:42:46.520 --> 2:42:47.520]  You think Texas is free.
[2:42:47.520 --> 2:42:50.520]  We're one of the only states where you can't open carry a handgun.
[2:42:50.520 --> 2:42:54.520]  And I think they're going to continue to press this issue.
[2:42:54.520 --> 2:42:56.520]  I don't believe they're going to back down and we welcome the fight.
[2:42:56.520 --> 2:42:59.520]  I encourage them to try and take our rights.
[2:42:59.520 --> 2:43:00.520]  I encourage them to try.
[2:43:00.520 --> 2:43:02.520]  Show us the tyrants you are.
[2:43:02.520 --> 2:43:09.520]  I mean, there's a reason that we're going to take the battle to the Alamo and there's a reason that we're going to bring the battle to the capital.
[2:43:09.520 --> 2:43:15.520]  There's four words and they're true words and every freedom loving Texan needs to listen to this very carefully.
[2:43:15.520 --> 2:43:16.520]  Our message is simple.
[2:43:16.520 --> 2:43:17.520]  Come and take it.
[2:43:17.520 --> 2:43:19.520]  And that's what's found in the state.
[2:43:19.520 --> 2:43:20.520]  So that's bad.
[2:43:20.520 --> 2:43:23.520]  We're not going to give them to you.
[2:43:23.520 --> 2:43:25.520]  You're going to have to take them.
[2:43:25.520 --> 2:43:30.520]  And you know, just because you say you're a police officer doesn't give you the right to make up laws.
[2:43:30.520 --> 2:43:37.520]  And we have a right according to God, according to the Constitution and according to Texas law to have these weapons and to open carry them.
[2:43:37.520 --> 2:43:39.520]  And whether they like it or not is irrelevant.
[2:43:39.520 --> 2:43:45.520]  And what's happening is police officers are being given way too much authority.
[2:43:45.520 --> 2:43:49.520]  I've heard the awesome police chief say even if a cop's wrong, their order is God.
[2:43:49.520 --> 2:43:50.520]  That's it.
[2:43:50.520 --> 2:43:53.520]  Common law, common sense says you don't have to follow an illegal order.
[2:43:53.520 --> 2:43:54.520]  That's correct.
[2:43:54.520 --> 2:44:03.520]  The DPS, we talked to the head guy at DPS and he said the buck stops here and I said we're going to order the arrest for open carrying of long guns.
[2:44:03.520 --> 2:44:06.520]  And that came straight out of his mouth and we were like, who came we talked to?
[2:44:06.520 --> 2:44:08.520]  And by the way, they really are delusional now.
[2:44:08.520 --> 2:44:13.520]  They're pulling not just the women in Dallas, the women in Houston over with no probable cause.
[2:44:13.520 --> 2:44:16.520]  They're doing it a lot now where they actually and we're such animals.
[2:44:16.520 --> 2:44:21.520]  They don't even change gloves, which is a serious issue obviously for women.
[2:44:21.520 --> 2:44:23.520]  And they're doing proctology exams.
[2:44:23.520 --> 2:44:24.520]  Yes.
[2:44:24.520 --> 2:44:26.520]  I mean, this is getting these people are crazy.
[2:44:26.520 --> 2:44:27.520]  It is getting scary.
[2:44:27.520 --> 2:44:33.520]  And again, people don't think it is happening to them because it's not on their front doorstep, but it's happening all over the place.
[2:44:33.520 --> 2:44:38.520]  And we just we've got to look and we've got to rise up and that and then people don't understand what that really means.
[2:44:38.520 --> 2:44:39.520]  That's right.
[2:44:39.520 --> 2:44:40.520]  We've got to rise up.
[2:44:40.520 --> 2:44:41.520]  We also have something else I'll bring out.
[2:44:41.520 --> 2:44:44.520]  We've got to look at the actions of people like Attorney General Greg Abbott.
[2:44:44.520 --> 2:44:51.520]  And we've spoken with his campaign with his office and we're looking for for action from him, not just a statement released on his position necessarily.
[2:44:51.520 --> 2:44:52.520]  Although that could be helpful.
[2:44:52.520 --> 2:45:00.520]  He needs to expose the lieutenant governor and the governor blocking bills that have overwhelming support to bring open carry to Texas.
[2:45:00.520 --> 2:45:04.520]  That would be good. Also, at this point, he's the highest ranking law enforcement official in Texas.
[2:45:04.520 --> 2:45:08.520]  He can file an injunction preventing these arrest.
[2:45:08.520 --> 2:45:12.520]  He can order the director of the DPS to stop it and to move to North Korea.
[2:45:12.520 --> 2:45:17.520]  There is absolutely a lot that he can do within his, maybe not quite that, but there's a lot he can do within his current.
[2:45:17.520 --> 2:45:18.520]  What do you mean?
[2:45:18.520 --> 2:45:21.520]  Listen, listen to the attorney general starts hauling in the head of the DPS.
[2:45:21.520 --> 2:45:22.520]  Oh, yeah.
[2:45:22.520 --> 2:45:24.520]  There is much that he can do.
[2:45:24.520 --> 2:45:25.520]  So we're looking for action.
[2:45:25.520 --> 2:45:28.520]  Where's Governor Perry with the head of the DPS?
[2:45:28.520 --> 2:45:34.520]  That is that, you know, out of all the people that we would have expected to hear from, we would have expected to hear from him.
[2:45:34.520 --> 2:45:36.520]  And we know that he's aware of it.
[2:45:36.520 --> 2:45:44.520]  I am personally extremely disappointed that he hasn't come out and spoke out on on my behalf and the veterans behalf that have fought for this country.
[2:45:44.520 --> 2:45:52.520]  I'm shocked even know that I know that he's not a true and blue second amendment, you know, freedom, love and support are all the way like we want him to be.
[2:45:52.520 --> 2:45:53.520]  Sure.
[2:45:53.520 --> 2:45:54.520]  I gave him more credit than I see today.
[2:45:54.520 --> 2:45:57.520]  Well, I mean, I've seen him in public waving handguns around.
[2:45:57.520 --> 2:45:58.520]  Absolutely.
[2:45:58.520 --> 2:46:00.520]  Arrest the governor.
[2:46:00.520 --> 2:46:01.520]  Right.
[2:46:01.520 --> 2:46:06.520]  It's really easy to put pictures out in Facebook of, you know, you, you, the candidate shooting or, or staying.
[2:46:06.520 --> 2:46:07.520]  They love the second amendment.
[2:46:07.520 --> 2:46:11.520]  But what really matters is well, here's the deal, folks, is not we're just obsessed with our guns.
[2:46:11.520 --> 2:46:13.520]  If they get those, everything else falls.
[2:46:13.520 --> 2:46:14.520]  That's a historical fact.
[2:46:14.520 --> 2:46:24.520]  But I want to go to Gary, but specifically for those that don't know, you cannot open carry a handgun in Texas when there's only a few other states that are like that.
[2:46:24.520 --> 2:46:30.520]  Yeah, five, very shameful and, but you can open carry ball and cap and they knew it was ball and cap.
[2:46:30.520 --> 2:46:33.520]  They knew it was black powder and they said, we don't care.
[2:46:33.520 --> 2:46:34.520]  We don't like it.
[2:46:34.520 --> 2:46:35.520]  That's exactly what they said.
[2:46:35.520 --> 2:46:37.520]  So they don't like how my hair is combed.
[2:46:37.520 --> 2:46:38.520]  I'm going to jail.
[2:46:38.520 --> 2:46:39.520]  It might be alarming.
[2:46:39.520 --> 2:46:40.520]  You never know.
[2:46:40.520 --> 2:46:42.520]  I find their behavior alarming.
[2:46:42.520 --> 2:46:43.520]  And that's why we're taking action.
[2:46:43.520 --> 2:46:44.520]  Very alarming.
[2:46:44.520 --> 2:46:47.520]  I was very alarmed myself.
[2:46:47.520 --> 2:46:51.520]  And honestly, I would, you, you can't see it on the video, but I was very afraid.
[2:46:51.520 --> 2:46:55.520]  Now, now let's go to, let's go to Gary Hayes.
[2:46:55.520 --> 2:46:57.520]  Gary was, they said arrested.
[2:46:57.520 --> 2:46:58.520]  It was in the news.
[2:46:58.520 --> 2:46:59.520]  They arrested one of their gentlemen.
[2:46:59.520 --> 2:47:00.520]  I'm going to talk about him.
[2:47:00.520 --> 2:47:03.520]  And then they were putting him in an ambulance last time our cameras left.
[2:47:03.520 --> 2:47:06.520]  And then now they released him, but now they want him arrested again.
[2:47:06.520 --> 2:47:16.520]  And sir, tell us, tell us exactly what happened to you and where this is going to tell us a little bit about yourself, Gary, as a fellow evil patriot.
[2:47:16.520 --> 2:47:17.520]  Hello, Alex.
[2:47:17.520 --> 2:47:18.520]  How are you doing today?
[2:47:18.520 --> 2:47:19.520]  Good, buddy.
[2:47:19.520 --> 2:47:30.520]  Well, you know, I'm, I'm, I think you're changing it from every minute, but I was arrested Friday for carrying my black powder.
[2:47:30.520 --> 2:47:33.520]  It's kind of, kind of strange how it all came about.
[2:47:33.520 --> 2:47:41.520]  I mean, I, I'd gone to the Capitol to try to gain information as to why my fellow patriots were, were arrested.
[2:47:41.520 --> 2:47:50.520]  And I had talked to several different troopers and over a course of maybe 30 minutes to an hour.
[2:47:50.520 --> 2:48:08.520]  And when I finally was able to get them to let me talk to a supervisor, I talked to him for a good 15 or 20 minutes until he noticed my black powder revolver that I had in on my seat next to me in my wheelchair.
[2:48:08.520 --> 2:48:11.520]  It was, I was very careful how I went up there.
[2:48:11.520 --> 2:48:20.520]  I mean, you know, it was definitely put toward, you know, it wasn't displayed, you know, where you could see it.
[2:48:20.520 --> 2:48:23.520]  Obviously, otherwise they would have already seen it.
[2:48:23.520 --> 2:48:28.520]  As soon as he saw that, though, he told me he was alarmed and.
[2:48:28.520 --> 2:48:29.520]  Okay.
[2:48:29.520 --> 2:48:33.520]  So now if you even conceal it and it's black powder and legal, they arrest you.
[2:48:33.520 --> 2:48:36.520]  I mean, what they're, it's a club that only they want to be in.
[2:48:36.520 --> 2:48:41.520]  And I think it's shameful they're trying to convert police over to these North Korean Gestapo types.
[2:48:41.520 --> 2:48:46.520]  Now, what about the new news that they may come out in a and a rearrest, you know?
[2:48:46.520 --> 2:48:51.520]  Well, yeah, they, they spent 24 hours in the Travis County jail.
[2:48:51.520 --> 2:48:53.520]  And of course, I am a quadruple.
[2:48:53.520 --> 2:48:54.520]  You come out of paraplegia.
[2:48:54.520 --> 2:48:59.520]  I do have paralysis and all four limbs.
[2:48:59.520 --> 2:49:02.520]  They had me in a regular jail cell.
[2:49:02.520 --> 2:49:08.520]  And I had problems all the time because of my disability.
[2:49:08.520 --> 2:49:11.520]  I wasn't able to get water.
[2:49:11.520 --> 2:49:13.520]  I wasn't able to.
[2:49:13.520 --> 2:49:18.520]  They basically just threw my chair and threw my food at the door like I'm supposed to get up and get it.
[2:49:18.520 --> 2:49:19.520]  So anyway.
[2:49:19.520 --> 2:49:21.520]  How did you become disabled?
[2:49:21.520 --> 2:49:23.520]  Well, there's been a car wreck 10 years ago.
[2:49:23.520 --> 2:49:26.520]  I broke my neck in three places.
[2:49:26.520 --> 2:49:31.520]  And so that that's how it became disabled.
[2:49:31.520 --> 2:49:34.520]  But anyway, they were well aware of my disability.
[2:49:34.520 --> 2:49:40.520]  And they, you know, when they arrested me Friday, they, you know, one of my concerns was,
[2:49:40.520 --> 2:49:43.520]  am I going to be, you know, going to jail?
[2:49:43.520 --> 2:49:44.520]  Obviously.
[2:49:44.520 --> 2:49:50.520]  But are they equipped to handle my, my, my, my me physically and my needs?
[2:49:50.520 --> 2:49:52.520]  And I was, I was, I was told they were.
[2:49:52.520 --> 2:50:00.520]  Well, I was put on the medical ward, but which was basically look like any other jail except they had a lady that came around and took you.
[2:50:00.520 --> 2:50:01.520]  Blood pressure.
[2:50:01.520 --> 2:50:03.520]  Yeah, it's absolutely disgusting.
[2:50:03.520 --> 2:50:05.520]  I mean, look, all the criminals are outside the jails.
[2:50:05.520 --> 2:50:08.520]  All the patriots are in the jails under this system.
[2:50:08.520 --> 2:50:13.520]  Are you going to be down there on the 19th and San Antonio at the Alamo?
[2:50:13.520 --> 2:50:16.520]  Yes, I plan on it.
[2:50:16.520 --> 2:50:18.520]  Yeah, I'm not going to miss that.
[2:50:18.520 --> 2:50:26.520]  You know, I, I, I'm limited as far as sometimes traveling, you know, I have to make arrangements.
[2:50:26.520 --> 2:50:33.520]  And, you know, because my, my, my disability, you know, it's, it's hard for me to get out on my own.
[2:50:33.520 --> 2:50:38.520]  But, you know, I definitely have, I have arrangements to go down there.
[2:50:38.520 --> 2:50:40.520]  I try to go to every event I can.
[2:50:40.520 --> 2:50:41.520]  Well, great job, brother.
[2:50:41.520 --> 2:50:43.520]  We're going to watch this as it unfolds.
[2:50:43.520 --> 2:50:48.520]  The video of you being kidnapped is up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[2:50:48.520 --> 2:50:50.520]  We'll retweet it out at realalexions.
[2:50:50.520 --> 2:50:51.520]  Thank you.
[2:50:51.520 --> 2:50:55.520]  We're going to come back and go to you guys and talk about what's coming up at the Alamo.
[2:50:55.520 --> 2:50:59.520]  Then to the phone calls and to overdrive for everybody that's patiently holding.
[2:50:59.520 --> 2:51:28.520]  Thank you, brother.
[2:51:29.520 --> 2:51:40.520]  We the people grow cotton, wheat fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit and carting to a private bank having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to serve as debt.
[2:51:40.520 --> 2:51:47.520]  This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing to public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[2:51:47.520 --> 2:52:01.520]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system. Call for your copy 800-686-2237. It's time to understand the system. Call 800-686-2237. That's 800-686-2237.
[2:52:01.520 --> 2:52:03.520]  Hi there. My name is Frank Bates.
[2:52:03.520 --> 2:52:07.520]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[2:52:07.520 --> 2:52:17.520]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[2:52:17.520 --> 2:52:23.520]  Incompetent line crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[2:52:23.520 --> 2:52:31.520]  Some have called this a conspiracy. Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[2:52:31.520 --> 2:52:39.520]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[2:52:39.520 --> 2:52:45.520]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patrons have already seen in the last three months.
[2:52:45.520 --> 2:52:51.520]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home.
[2:52:51.520 --> 2:53:00.520]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down. Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[2:53:00.520 --> 2:53:06.520]  For over five years, you've been hearing about the Berkey guy, so you may know a few things about him.
[2:53:06.520 --> 2:53:12.520]  For example, you are well aware of the superior quality and effectiveness of Berkey water filters and accessories.
[2:53:12.520 --> 2:53:18.520]  But did you know the Berkeys have had independent lab tests done to prove just how effective they are?
[2:53:18.520 --> 2:53:23.520]  It's true and he can email you the test results. Just visit goberkey.com.
[2:53:23.520 --> 2:53:28.520]  You may also know that the Berkey guy has helped tens of thousands of people get better prepared.

[2:53:55.520 --> 2:53:59.520]  Goberkey.com, home of a Berkey guy.
[2:54:11.520 --> 2:54:15.520]  You said you went to the Attorney General's office and they had info wars up on the screen.
[2:54:15.520 --> 2:54:18.520]  Now we're here with Terry Holcomb and Rachel Malone.
[2:54:18.520 --> 2:54:22.520]  I'm going to go into overdrive and take phone calls for people that are holding some stations.
[2:54:22.520 --> 2:54:30.520]  Carry it, some don't. You can go to infowars.com and listen to the audio feed or infowars.com forward slash show.
[2:54:30.520 --> 2:54:44.520]  And right there you can find, you can find all of the video and audio feeds, all of the free apps that are there.
[2:54:44.520 --> 2:54:50.520]  iPhone apps, droid apps, you name it infowars.com forward slash show.
[2:54:50.520 --> 2:54:56.520]  But finishing up the points that you're making about all this and what's coming up with the Alamo situation,
[2:54:56.520 --> 2:55:02.520]  there's only a matter of time until the police shoot people that are at an open carry.
[2:55:02.520 --> 2:55:10.520]  And now you're at Lexington, you're at Concord, and I know Homeland Security is spoiling for a fight with the American people.
[2:55:10.520 --> 2:55:16.520]  It's set up for that, but it's, I've looked at the numbers, they're going to lose, they're crazy.
[2:55:16.520 --> 2:55:21.520]  And I hope that they understand what's happening, but you were making the point there, Rachel, that this is bullying.
[2:55:21.520 --> 2:55:22.520]  Talk about that.
[2:55:22.520 --> 2:55:29.520]  Absolutely, this is bullying. Even if the charges don't necessarily stick, even if Terry fights us and wins the case,
[2:55:29.520 --> 2:55:33.520]  he's been bullied, he's been terrorized through official oppression.
[2:55:33.520 --> 2:55:39.520]  And I'm guessing their hope is that people will see this and back off and stop carrying their black powder pistols.
[2:55:39.520 --> 2:55:48.520]  And that's why you don't see rifles in racks anymore. The cops come after you, even though the rifle's legal.
[2:55:48.520 --> 2:55:56.520]  It's all intimidation and they know it. The answer is more people doing it and them getting sued so they get intimidated by liberty.
[2:55:56.520 --> 2:56:00.520]  Exactly. So don't be bullied into letting your rights be infringed.
[2:56:00.520 --> 2:56:02.520]  Look at them harassing the Tea Parties with the IRS.
[2:56:02.520 --> 2:56:03.520]  Oh, absolutely.
[2:56:03.520 --> 2:56:05.520]  It's all bullying. They're a bunch of bullies.
[2:56:05.520 --> 2:56:12.520]  And a lot of people don't understand what official oppression is. The Texas Penal Code has that under 3903, a public servant,
[2:56:12.520 --> 2:56:16.520]  acting under the color of his or her office of employment,
[2:56:16.520 --> 2:56:28.520]  commits an offense if they intentionally deny or impede another in the exercise or enjoyment of any right, privilege, power, or immunity,
[2:56:28.520 --> 2:56:33.520]  knowing his conduct is unlawful, or intentionally subjects another.
[2:56:33.520 --> 2:56:39.520]  If a cop showed up at a busy restaurant and said, get out of this table, I want to sit here, that'd be official oppression.
[2:56:39.520 --> 2:56:40.520]  Absolutely.
[2:56:40.520 --> 2:56:44.520]  But if they arrest you for your gun, that is felony-level official oppression.
[2:56:44.520 --> 2:56:48.520]  That is false imprisonment. That is enslavement. That is a civil rights violation.
[2:56:48.520 --> 2:56:52.520]  That is racketeering because they all agreed. That was a mafia.
[2:56:52.520 --> 2:56:53.520]  It was.
[2:56:53.520 --> 2:56:56.520]  And they're all sitting back laughing. They're going to laugh later when we take this country back.
[2:56:56.520 --> 2:56:58.520]  They are. And we are going to take this country back.
[2:56:58.520 --> 2:57:03.520]  The people are just now starting to wake up. They're coming out of their coma.
[2:57:03.520 --> 2:57:04.520]  Are you seeing that happen?
[2:57:04.520 --> 2:57:08.520]  Oh, no. We are definitely seeing that happen. We're getting more support. We're getting more people involved.
[2:57:08.520 --> 2:57:10.520]  We're having more questions being asked.
[2:57:10.520 --> 2:57:15.520]  You would be surprised at the people that have no clue that we can conceal Kerry, let alone open Kerry along the way.
[2:57:15.520 --> 2:57:20.520]  The average person that isn't from Texas or somebody comes to your house and they see a gun rack, they call the cops.
[2:57:20.520 --> 2:57:25.520]  We had a lady ask in Chick-fil-A just down the road here just a little while ago, do you have a gun in you?
[2:57:25.520 --> 2:57:27.520]  Yeah. You're allowed to carry that?
[2:57:27.520 --> 2:57:32.520]  People don't know. It's like they live in some bubble and they have no idea what's going on.
[2:57:32.520 --> 2:57:36.520]  Well, that's because the media thinks everything revolves around New York City.
[2:57:36.520 --> 2:57:39.520]  I mean, they actually, all the shows are based there basically.
[2:57:39.520 --> 2:57:42.520]  And every show, the cop pulls over, you got a gun, you're going to jail for that.
[2:57:42.520 --> 2:57:44.520]  Well, TV is their greatest weapon.
[2:57:44.520 --> 2:57:51.520]  Yeah. We need people waking up to realize the value of liberty, to realize what's being taken away from us,
[2:57:51.520 --> 2:57:56.520]  and to realize they can't just sit back anymore and watch and hope that somebody else fights for them.
[2:57:56.520 --> 2:58:00.520]  We need large numbers of people mobilized to turn out for rallies such as the one coming up.
[2:58:00.520 --> 2:58:10.520]  We also need large numbers of people mobilized to make phone calls to these offices, to email, to show up, to be involved in the legislative process.
[2:58:10.520 --> 2:58:13.520]  That's right. They're coming for your guns. They're coming for your First Amendment, everything.
[2:58:13.520 --> 2:58:19.520]  How big is this going to be on the 19th? Give people the time down at the Alamo, open Kerry,
[2:58:19.520 --> 2:58:24.520]  and the Land Commissioner is saying that he's going to stand for the Second Amendment, correct?
[2:58:24.520 --> 2:58:32.520]  Oh, absolutely. He is going to put out, you know, from his office a public notification that we are having that event, and he is approving it.
[2:58:32.520 --> 2:58:37.520]  Tell you what, I want to hear about this for five more minutes, then we're going to come back, and I promise go to the calls and then wrap it up.

[3:00:06.520 --> 3:00:23.520]  You want answers? Well so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[3:00:37.520 --> 3:00:47.520]  And that's the top voted up of tens of thousands. It's the top one. Take everybody's gun. I'm going to cover this in the next segment and go to your phone calls.
[3:00:47.520 --> 3:00:58.520]  You've been patiently holding. Thank you so much for doing that. A lot going on around here. Terry Hockam and Rachel Malone, closing comments in the four minutes we've got left in this short segment.
[3:00:58.520 --> 3:01:11.520]  This is so historical. And I just want to say, I salute what you and others are doing. You are the modern, real civil rights movement fighting for all of our future because if they can pull a keystone of the Second Amendment out, it all falls.
[3:01:11.520 --> 3:01:21.520]  It absolutely all falls. Everything hinges on the Second Amendment. The right of the people. And they are trying to take that right to further their own agenda. They absolutely want to...
[3:01:21.520 --> 3:01:30.520]  They're criminal. They're trying to rob us. Absolutely are. And in closing my comments and then I'll let Rachel finish us off. We can't emphasize this enough. Get off of Facebook.
[3:01:30.520 --> 3:01:39.520]  Get off of Facebook and get out there and go to work. If you want to take it back, you're going to have to physically go do that. And we're at a pivotal point in Texas.
[3:01:39.520 --> 3:01:48.520]  We're going to either lose it or we're going to take it back. And what people do matters. We can't be sheep. We can't be timid. We can't let them bully us.
[3:01:48.520 --> 3:01:56.520]  Even if we're afraid, we can't show fear. We have to go to the front line and we have to tell them we're not going to stand down. And we can't do this by ourselves.
[3:01:56.520 --> 3:02:01.520]  You know, I'm going to go and I'm going to fight my fight for my family and for my rights.
[3:02:01.520 --> 3:02:07.520]  Did you see how aggressive they were to my reporter who was being polite in his face, threatening him? I mean, that cops...
[3:02:07.520 --> 3:02:18.520]  He was extremely aggressive and the only reason they weren't that aggressive with me is because I wasn't doing anything. I was letting them arrest me so that the people could see what was going on.
[3:02:18.520 --> 3:02:28.520]  And then they didn't want us to tape it. No, they didn't want you to tape it. They didn't want no reporters on there. He wanted to get him. That was a very, very terroristic tactic. Rachel?
[3:02:28.520 --> 3:02:35.520]  Absolutely. You know, we need more sheepdogs. We need more guardians of liberty here. We need more people who understand it and study it and know how to stand up.
[3:02:35.520 --> 3:02:42.520]  One thing you can do for people who are in Texas, you can sign up at TexasFirearmsFreedom.com, join the alarm list.

[3:02:49.520 --> 3:02:51.520]  And there are folks fighting in all of these states right now.
[3:02:51.520 --> 3:02:52.520]  Absolutely.
[3:02:52.520 --> 3:02:54.520]  And the enemy knows we're getting the momentum. They're scared.
[3:02:54.520 --> 3:02:55.520]  Absolutely.
[3:02:55.520 --> 3:03:07.520]  And in closing, October the 19th, San Antonio at the Alamo, starting at 10 o'clock, we are having a draw line in the sand event. And then Jerry Patterson is going to be there.
[3:03:07.520 --> 3:03:11.520]  We're going to have 800 to 1200, possibly more people because it just continues to grow and grow.
[3:03:11.520 --> 3:03:16.520]  The San Antonio chief of police has stated he don't care what the law is. We're going to arrest him anyway.
[3:03:16.520 --> 3:03:19.520]  And we were drawn a line in the sand and saying, you're not going to bully up.
[3:03:19.520 --> 3:03:26.520]  And I think everybody should show up, say at about 9.45, so just everyone converges at once. It goes, what, 10 to 2, right?
[3:03:26.520 --> 3:03:27.520]  That's correct.
[3:03:27.520 --> 3:03:32.520]  Everybody converges at once so they can't stop everybody. I think we should have 10,000 people down there.
[3:03:32.520 --> 3:03:33.520]  I agree.
[3:03:33.520 --> 3:03:40.520]  I can't believe the police chief says, I don't care what the law is. I don't care if the land commissioner says this is state land. You can't stop them. There's not even a law against this.
[3:03:40.520 --> 3:03:43.520]  I can't believe that that police chief is so bad.
[3:03:43.520 --> 3:03:48.520]  Well, he's no different than what just happened in Austin. They're just being a little bit more sneaky about it, so I'm going to go ahead and...
[3:03:48.520 --> 3:03:50.520]  Really, all feds. They've been federalized.
[3:03:50.520 --> 3:03:53.520]  And I'm going to go ahead before we close and put Austin on notice.
[3:03:53.520 --> 3:03:58.520]  Expect us come November. Once we finish the October event, we're going to be planning one for Austin.
[3:03:58.520 --> 3:04:04.520]  So, Mr. Snead, Mr. Ortiz, Commander Ortiz of DPS, Governor Rick Perry, State Preservation Board.
[3:04:04.520 --> 3:04:08.520]  Just understand we're coming to the capital of Austin and we're coming with thousands of people.
[3:04:08.520 --> 3:04:16.520]  Wow. It's just amazing that Ardee Saveta, the police chief's dad, ran guns into Cuba for those enslaved people.
[3:04:16.520 --> 3:04:21.520]  Ardee Saveta is chilling the line with Obama saying, take our guns.
[3:04:21.520 --> 3:04:25.520]  And if we don't stand and fight back, that's exactly what's going to happen.
[3:04:25.520 --> 3:04:29.520]  I mean, I told him, I don't think you're a communist, but why don't you move back to Cuba, man?
[3:04:29.520 --> 3:04:31.520]  We're only the government has the guns.
[3:04:31.520 --> 3:04:36.520]  Or here's what I'm willing to do. I'm willing to give all those folks the northeast side of the country,
[3:04:36.520 --> 3:04:39.520]  and I'll even give them California if they want it and leave the rest...
[3:04:39.520 --> 3:04:43.520]  That's a great idea. How about if you're anti-gun, you move to California, or you move to New York?
[3:04:43.520 --> 3:04:47.520]  Let's just go ahead and split the country in half. I'll even give the libertarians a third of it.
[3:04:47.520 --> 3:04:51.520]  We'll split it in three, and that way we can all enjoy the freedoms that we so want.
[3:04:51.520 --> 3:04:56.520]  I'm going to live around the line with a conservative libertarian area.
[3:04:56.520 --> 3:05:00.520]  If I want to be bad, I can step right over.
[3:05:00.520 --> 3:05:05.520]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[3:05:05.520 --> 3:05:11.520]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet, the highest rates of diabetes, autism,
[3:05:11.520 --> 3:05:16.520]  and every other major disease? It all comes down to one thing.
[3:05:16.520 --> 3:05:22.520]  We are what we eat. Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[3:05:22.520 --> 3:05:26.520]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[3:05:26.520 --> 3:05:29.520]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[3:05:29.520 --> 3:05:35.520]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicists by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[3:07:56.520 --> 3:08:21.520]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[3:08:21.520 --> 3:08:31.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, I will be on the nightly news tonight in the analysis section with David Knight breaking down the latest at 7 o'clock Central, 8 o'clock Eastern.
[3:08:31.520 --> 3:08:47.520]  You've got 12 dead now at the navel yard and we are digging up news articles where it looks like it was one of the highly restricted government facilities at military bases where very few personnel were allowed to be armed.
[3:08:47.520 --> 3:09:08.520]  There has been a bunch of big battles over this in the last 10 years since 2004, so I guess nine years with the Law Enforcement Safety Act to where basically anybody that's ever been in any type of special operations or police, you name it,
[3:09:08.520 --> 3:09:19.520]  even when they're retired, when they're on military bases but also off of military bases, they have like an automatic concealed carry, which is absolutely what you need bare minimum.
[3:09:19.520 --> 3:09:26.520]  I'd rather just have everybody armed, putting felons. Felons are still going to do bad things whether they're allowed to or not.
[3:09:26.520 --> 3:09:42.520]  Law abiding citizens are going to fall the law. I just say no gun laws like we had pre 1960s and you will see the crime rate absolutely plunge in this nation. That is the answer.
[3:09:42.520 --> 3:09:47.520]  You know, Hollywood hypes up all this crime in the old West and all that. That's actually not even really true.
[3:09:47.520 --> 3:09:57.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, except in certain border regions with Mexico and in certain periods, usually the crime was being committed by the railroad or by big interest, pushing people out.
[3:09:57.520 --> 3:10:14.520]  This story just broke up on info wars dot com by Anthony Gucci Artie and it's chilling top comments on CNN Navy yard shooting top comments on CNN call for complete gunband.
[3:10:14.520 --> 3:10:25.520]  It's a pretty good headline, but it's been like CNN's top comment top voted comment on CNN or top voted comment CNN top voted comment confiscate all guns elect Hillary Clinton.
[3:10:25.520 --> 3:10:28.520]  That's actually what it says.
[3:10:28.520 --> 3:10:44.520]  This is what Hillary Clinton for 2016 says. This is exactly what we need to stop hedging our bets and just start our campaign to outlaw all guns.
[3:10:44.520 --> 3:10:57.520]  We need to take the House and the Senate vote for Hillary in 2016 in order for us to stand up and loudly declare that individuals have no reason.
[3:10:57.520 --> 3:10:59.520]  Yeah, I finally found the voice.
[3:10:59.520 --> 3:11:04.520]  No reason to earn a gun.
[3:11:04.520 --> 3:11:14.520]  People will give you examples all day long and facts to I added a preventing rape and murder.
[3:11:14.520 --> 3:11:17.520]  But how do we stop the government from raping you have your arms?
[3:11:17.520 --> 3:11:21.520]  Oops, I added that. I'm sorry. Let me read the whole thing on unedited by me on air.
[3:11:21.520 --> 3:11:29.520]  Okay, let me just read it. I'm going to read the whole thing from the start. Let me just let me get into character.
[3:11:29.520 --> 3:11:31.520]  Hold on. I'm almost there.
[3:11:31.520 --> 3:11:38.520]  Work with me, folks. It's embarrassing. Don't don't aim the camera at me when I do this. Just just go to go to the story on him for worse.
[3:11:38.520 --> 3:11:48.520]  It's too embarrassing. I have to do this in private.
[3:11:48.520 --> 3:11:53.520]  Citizen with a gun. Black scheme a strips.
[3:11:53.520 --> 3:11:57.520]  Okay, good checkpoints.
[3:11:57.520 --> 3:11:59.520]  North Korea. I like it.
[3:11:59.520 --> 3:12:01.520]  Okay, I'm getting out of the mindset.
[3:12:01.520 --> 3:12:13.520]  I'm becoming Hillary Clinton for 2016 on CNN top voted on an article with tens of thousands of comments. Here we go.
[3:12:13.520 --> 3:12:18.520]  Now I'm ready. I'm going to your calls. Excuse me. It's just hard to channel this.
[3:12:18.520 --> 3:12:23.520]  Look at that person. They've got money. I'm going to take all their money.
[3:12:23.520 --> 3:12:32.520]  I'm really an authoritarian sickening control freak. I'm going to have a position of power inside the power structure when we totally take over.
[3:12:32.520 --> 3:12:36.520]  See, I'm now flowing the person. Now I'm ready.
[3:12:36.520 --> 3:12:40.520]  They'll never figure out. I'm really a sickening control freak that hates everybody.
[3:12:40.520 --> 3:12:45.520]  This is the top comment on CNN. I'm ready. I prepared myself for four minutes.
[3:12:45.520 --> 3:12:50.520]  It's very painful to channel this person. They're so weak. But here we go.
[3:12:50.520 --> 3:13:07.520]  This is exactly what we need to stop hedging our bets and just start our campaign to outlaw all guns.
[3:13:07.520 --> 3:13:27.520]  We need to take the House and the Senate and vote for Hillary in 2016 in order for us to stand up and loudly, loudly declare that the individual has no reason to own a gun.
[3:13:27.520 --> 3:13:39.520]  People will give you examples all day long of preventing rape and murder with their guns. But statistically they do more harm than good. They'll never figure out that's a total lie.
[3:13:39.520 --> 3:13:53.520]  Oh, excuse me. Just because one father was able to stop his daughter from being raped does not mean we should not look at the bigger picture of guns doing more harm than good.
[3:13:53.520 --> 3:14:02.520]  I want to live in South Side Chicago. I want to live in DC with 14 locks on my door. I want to be under 10, 20, 30 times a crime rate.
[3:14:02.520 --> 3:14:06.520]  I'm Mexico. I want to die.
[3:14:06.520 --> 3:14:14.520]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, I have just successfully covered that on air. Was that not a stunning rendition?
[3:14:14.520 --> 3:14:27.520]  Huh? Ladies and gentlemen, absolutely. There you go. Of course, here's the actual Forbes article. To deter gun slaughters, the federal government must cease disarming the innocence.
[3:14:27.520 --> 3:14:38.520]  Forbes, go read the article with all the breakdown by Professor John Lott. I need to get him back on the transmission.
[3:14:38.520 --> 3:14:53.520]  There you go. They picked another area where the general public was disarmed. And now we get to see a big grandstanding helicopter's armored vehicles, the specialized cops come and wait hours and then go in for two guys.
[3:14:53.520 --> 3:15:01.520]  The old days they'd just gone up the tower and killed him. The old days they'd just run in, find the guy and kill him. But again, now it's all about the nanny state.
[3:15:01.520 --> 3:15:11.520]  Imagine the nanny states all wrestling with weapons and drones going, give us your weapons and we promise to be friendly, like we did in Soviet Russia, like we did in China.
[3:15:11.520 --> 3:15:18.520]  Never mind the weatherman plans to put you in a forced labor camp.
[3:15:18.520 --> 3:15:32.520]  The truth is we just want to have your wife in a forced labor camp. You'll be dead and you know what we're going to do. You thought the TSA was bad, huh? You think the Texas State Police doing proctology exams is bad? We're going to do a lot more, Buster.
[3:15:32.520 --> 3:15:42.520]  And when we say gun control, we just mean for you. And remember, the San Antonio police chief says he's going to arrest anybody with a rifle. It's illegal to have a load of rifle on the streets.
[3:15:42.520 --> 3:15:48.520]  He says, I don't care what the law is. You come to the Alamo, I'm going to arrest you. I am Santa Anna.
[3:15:48.520 --> 3:15:53.520]  Let's go ahead and talk to Alex in Kentucky. Thanks for holding her a trooper.
[3:15:53.520 --> 3:16:00.520]  Then we'll go to Bert and others. Go ahead, Alex. You're on the air. Would you like to hand in your firearms to a simpering person?
[3:16:00.520 --> 3:16:03.520]  Absolutely not, Alex. Thanks for taking my call.
[3:16:03.520 --> 3:16:13.520]  I want to talk a little bit about what I see going on here from my perspective. I'm glad you brought up the CNN thing because that ties a little more into what I'm going to talk about.
[3:16:13.520 --> 3:16:24.520]  Basically, what I see going on here is, let's face the facts, they are not going to ban the guns at all. They're not going to take the guns and they know that.
[3:16:24.520 --> 3:16:35.520]  They know that they're not going to be able to get our guns because, I mean, we're the American people. They've taken guns in other nations in history, throughout history, but we are the American people. We're exceptional.
[3:16:35.520 --> 3:16:39.520]  That is racist talk. Racist. Racist.
[3:16:39.520 --> 3:16:52.520]  Absolutely. I am a racist because I love freedom. But what I'm saying is, they're using all of these events, whether they're staged or not, whether they're propped up or not.
[3:16:52.520 --> 3:16:57.520]  They certainly use them and magnify them and act like a planet just hit us or something.
[3:16:57.520 --> 3:17:13.520]  What they're doing is, they're getting us as gun owners to turn on ourselves and cause these ammunition shortages because we saw after Sandy Hook happened, we saw everyone had to rush out and get a 223 and they had to stock up.
[3:17:13.520 --> 3:17:25.520]  But sir, I think that's a good problem because even though it costs more upfront than people up their production and later prices go down for new people getting in. Good. I don't know. They're trying to buy up all the guns because they don't want us to have them.
[3:17:25.520 --> 3:17:45.520]  And as we're still seeing the ammunition shortage, or at least I don't know how it is across the US, but here in Kentucky, I mean, we're still seeing the 22 long rifle. You can't get any 22 long rifle at all. And if you can find a box, it's hyped up by like, you know, three times what it used to be price wise.
[3:17:45.520 --> 3:17:56.520]  And what I'm saying is, you know, that these manufacturers can't keep up with the with the with the demand that they're getting. So they're the the elites, they're using this.
[3:17:56.520 --> 3:18:08.520]  They are using this the free market and the way, you know, the demand goes up to basically force us to not have anymore. You know, those of us, you know, I stock up on guns and ammunition.
[3:18:08.520 --> 3:18:14.520]  I'm sitting on pretty good, a pretty good collection myself, but I was doing it before these mass shootings even happened.
[3:18:14.520 --> 3:18:24.520]  No, listen, I understand that sir, but I mean, a lot of it is the government's buying billions of rounds of ammo and then doing contracts out five years. That's the big issue, but I appreciate your points.
[3:18:24.520 --> 3:18:35.520]  Let's talk to Burt in Texas. And I'm seeing this all the time. He says dove hunters near school arrested. I know people personally that live out in Hayes County, Travis County in the countryside.
[3:18:35.520 --> 3:18:47.520]  One guy owns over a hundred acres. He's plinking with his dear rifle, safe berm, whole nine yards, state police show up and they go, you alarmed your neighbor. I'm taking you to jail.
[3:18:47.520 --> 3:18:57.520]  And now if you if your California neighbor moves in, that's usually who it is. In fact, I've got neighbors that have had the neighbors call the cops on them and we go, oh, that's the neighbor from California.
[3:18:57.520 --> 3:19:06.520]  They move in. They think it's cheap home prices or whatever. You're a quarter mile from them. They hear guns. They call. And when you get the wrong state police, you're going to jail.
[3:19:06.520 --> 3:19:12.520]  So I don't know this story yet, but Burt, tell us about it. Maybe you deserve to be arrested, boy.
[3:19:12.520 --> 3:19:29.520]  Well, they had five hunt dove hunters that were out shooting in schools over. It was the site that was adjacent to a rural school out here. It is in the city limits, but the school has got a large piece of property and it's separated by railroad tracks and from
[3:19:29.520 --> 3:19:30.520]  Evergreen.
[3:19:30.520 --> 3:19:35.520]  Sure. And a shotgun isn't going to hit the school. So who cares? Any idiots should know they were bird hunters.
[3:19:35.520 --> 3:19:46.520]  Well, and they had a couple that mother was walking her kids home and her gunshot going off. And she said that she was sprayed by the pellets, which I'm not sure if that actually happened or not.
[3:19:46.520 --> 3:19:57.520]  But that was what they said. And she ran back to school. They called 911 and there was an incredible police response to the site.
[3:19:57.520 --> 3:20:10.520]  Well, by the way, I haven't told this story, but I live out in the country and I was shooting a 410 shotgun, not this summer, but last summer with my son at 10 cans at like 20 feet away.
[3:20:10.520 --> 3:20:21.520]  Okay. And I heard a woman shrieking and the property because there's like big pieces of property, but then small pieces and the woman two properties down who I later learned calls the cops and all the gun owners.
[3:20:21.520 --> 3:20:34.520]  And I heard her from the hilltop going firing. I hear it hitting. And then the police never showed up. But but but I've dealt with this myself. Go ahead.
[3:20:34.520 --> 3:20:43.520]  Well, and they had been out there shooting the day before and the same thing happened before. And the police said it's not a problem.
[3:20:43.520 --> 3:20:54.520]  Well, shooting out there. Well, the next day they had a lady that supposedly was hit by the shot and they did a complete lockdown on the school. They responded. They arrested the five men.
[3:20:54.520 --> 3:21:03.520]  They've released them, but they're going to, they're basically been being charged with deadly conduct because they were out doing does hunting.
[3:21:03.520 --> 3:21:12.520]  Well, meanwhile, where's the proof that the woman, I mean, I mean, if she was 100 yards away, it would like feel like he got slapped by the pellets. I mean, this sounds like pure bull.
[3:21:12.520 --> 3:21:29.520]  Well, and they had a local radio personality. They were going off this one woman. She just immediately responded just saying it's, you know, it's a tragedy and they need to, you know, they don't need to be doing this and they just went on and on for an hour or more.
[3:21:29.520 --> 3:21:43.520]  And, you know, it just, it made me so mad. The local Fox 34 news network had a reporter out there, you know, and she's carrying on and making everybody scared about shooting near a school and all of this.
[3:21:43.520 --> 3:21:52.520]  And they put on this poor little elementary kid and he says, please don't shoot at me school.
[3:21:52.520 --> 3:22:07.520]  Listen, the Pentagon is involved domestically in psyops. You think of the Pentagon as your friend. It's the globalist that run it. And you're going to see this everywhere where they're going to take any event and high put up in my gut tells me because of the timing and the history of all the things that have been happening.
[3:22:07.520 --> 3:22:17.520]  And I don't know how often you listen, Bert, but have you heard me no less than 10, 15 times the last few weeks say I'm looking for a mass shooting in a military base?
[3:22:17.520 --> 3:22:19.520]  I've listened to you every day.
[3:22:19.520 --> 3:22:21.520]  Have you heard me say that?
[3:22:21.520 --> 3:22:22.520]  Bill, yes.
[3:22:22.520 --> 3:22:33.520]  See, here's my problem. We don't have time to go back and show all the predictions how accurate they are. But I'm telling you, I think this, my gut tells me this is the start of a bunch of stuff.
[3:22:33.520 --> 3:22:40.520]  I mean, what does your gut tell you? I mean, you can just see, I can just see this. They may have led a group, but she hotties into the country.
[3:22:40.520 --> 3:22:46.520]  Now they've killed them. They may say, I mean, I've lived in about half the time they end up saying I'm behind it.
[3:22:46.520 --> 3:22:54.520]  In fact, I'm just waiting to hear these guys were listeners. I'm so sick of it. Well, God bless you, sir. Good to hear from you.
[3:22:54.520 --> 3:22:59.520]  And there you go. Where are you in Texas so we can look up that case? Oh, I guess he just hung up.
[3:22:59.520 --> 3:23:04.520]  Look up men arrested for dove hunting near school, Texas.
[3:23:04.520 --> 3:23:16.520]  I have had three different people the last two weeks come up to me one in the grocery store, one at a gas station and one at a bowling alley.
[3:23:16.520 --> 3:23:20.520]  And they got the bowling alley work there and I told him to do a YouTube and send it to me. He may have done it.
[3:23:20.520 --> 3:23:24.520]  And he said, no, I live on 100 acres family property.
[3:23:24.520 --> 3:23:27.520]  And we've been shooting out there since I was born.
[3:23:27.520 --> 3:23:31.520]  And we were just out there shooting and the police state police came and arrested me.
[3:23:31.520 --> 3:23:38.520]  They said you alarmed your neighbor and the neighbors have moved there from, I think he said Washington state in that case.
[3:23:38.520 --> 3:23:41.520]  So you get city people move in, you're shooting.
[3:23:41.520 --> 3:23:49.520]  Well, you see the articles all the time where you've got a gun and you're put in your car to go shooting and they the police come and they go ahead and take it.
[3:23:49.520 --> 3:23:57.520]  And should we start calling the police on cops and say I'm alarmed by a cop in a, you know, with a gun.
[3:23:57.520 --> 3:24:03.520]  I mean, that's kind of what this is coming down to. This is what they're doing is they're psychologically creating the idea that our guns are illegal.
[3:24:03.520 --> 3:24:10.520]  And that's what they're so mad about open carry because then that all the sheep will see that and go, you can have guns out in the open.
[3:24:10.520 --> 3:24:16.520]  It's absolutely scaring them.
[3:24:16.520 --> 3:24:24.520]  Meanwhile, drugs reports, drug resistant superbugs, urgent threat, 23,000 killed each year.
[3:24:24.520 --> 3:24:29.520]  Yeah, by the way, the numbers I've got is it's well over 100,000, but that's what the CDC says.
[3:24:29.520 --> 3:24:36.520]  It's over 390,000 killed in hospitals, one way or the other. That's NBC with the actual report.
[3:24:36.520 --> 3:24:48.520]  And again, we've got the new article up on info wars.com with top comments on CNN Navy yard shooting coverage already calling for complete gun ban.
[3:24:48.520 --> 3:24:59.520]  It's again, great headline by Anthony, but I'm going to pull editor here on air. The headline should be top voted comments on CNN call for total gun ban.
[3:24:59.520 --> 3:25:08.520]  Hillary 2016. That's the headline because that's a vote. That's them in there going, yeah, take the guns, baby. Let's do it.
[3:25:08.520 --> 3:25:15.520]  All right, let's go to another caller Solomon in New York. You're on the air. You ready to turn your guns in?
[3:25:15.520 --> 3:25:24.520]  Oh, no, no way. Mr. Alex Jones. Oh, listen, just before I talk about that, I, um, if you go to the Democratic Underground, which is a progressive.
[3:25:24.520 --> 3:25:33.520]  I know who they are in the website. It says they identified the shooter Alan Alexis 12 hours ago, 34. Now this is on the Google search.
[3:25:33.520 --> 3:25:43.520]  If you're researching types and right now, Aaron Alexis, 34, Texas, Democratic Underground, the time stands before you click the link in Google says 12 hours.
[3:25:43.520 --> 3:25:47.520]  Pull it up. Pull it up. So our word is Aaron Alexis.
[3:25:47.520 --> 3:25:54.520]  Yeah, R-O-N-A-L-E-X-I-S. So I have 34, Texas, Democratic Underground.
[3:25:54.520 --> 3:25:57.520]  There's 12 hours ago on the Google search.
[3:25:57.520 --> 3:26:03.520]  Amazing. In fact, we have it. You guys have it. Pull it up.
[3:26:03.520 --> 3:26:11.520]  There it is. Aaron Alexis 34 identified a shooter at Navy Yard 12 hours ago.
[3:26:11.520 --> 3:26:17.520]  Looks like somebody posted it during the AM instead of the PM on their schedule.
[3:26:17.520 --> 3:26:20.520]  So that to me was indicative of a false flag right there.
[3:26:20.520 --> 3:26:28.520]  And there's also another video here says YouTube shooting a Navy Yard, shooting witness false flags out at the stage.
[3:26:28.520 --> 3:26:33.520]  And you see these men laughing manically before they know they're on the air. Have you seen that yet?
[3:26:33.520 --> 3:26:37.520]  I'm getting a bunch of calls. Everybody thinks it's fake again.
[3:26:37.520 --> 3:26:44.520]  And let me tell you, when the Pentagon announced a month and a half ago, they're going to engage in domestic Psyops against us.
[3:26:44.520 --> 3:26:50.520]  This is a known Pentagon Psyop to commit mass shootings at military bases.
[3:26:50.520 --> 3:26:57.520]  And it said fake some of the shootings, but even have volunteers be wounded, but then kill civilians outside.
[3:26:57.520 --> 3:27:02.520]  This is all in Northwoods to then create the fear to take the liberty.
[3:27:02.520 --> 3:27:11.520]  Hitler dressed up Jewish concentration camp people in Polish uniforms and German uniforms and shot them for newsreels.
[3:27:11.520 --> 3:27:16.520]  That was Operation Hemler at Gliwitz in 1939.
[3:27:16.520 --> 3:27:20.520]  So yeah, this is a, I mean, the fact is this has been done over and over again.
[3:27:20.520 --> 3:27:23.520]  And you know, Paul Watson, I appreciate your call, sir.
[3:27:23.520 --> 3:27:28.520]  He tweets on real Alex Jones. And I think Paul's smarter than me in many ways. So I'm not knocking him.
[3:27:28.520 --> 3:27:33.520]  But I knew the criticism I would get as soon as I saw this. Here's twitchy.
[3:27:33.520 --> 3:27:41.520]  And it says, bring on the DERP conspiracy douche. Alex Jones doesn't know how breaking news works.
[3:27:41.520 --> 3:27:46.520]  And of course, yes, we do. Watson was asking the question because they have been changing it a lot.
[3:27:46.520 --> 3:27:52.520]  He said, why did the Washington Post originally report three shooters now only one?
[3:27:52.520 --> 3:27:55.520]  Well, yeah. And then they also said two. Now they're saying three again.
[3:27:55.520 --> 3:27:58.520]  And then they make fun of us going because news changes. Yeah.
[3:27:58.520 --> 3:28:02.520]  But you also got to watch it because they'll change it and try to cover it up like the drill.
[3:28:02.520 --> 3:28:10.520]  They admitted they were having on 7 7 in London and at the Boston bombing and other events, which they then denied.
[3:28:10.520 --> 3:28:16.520]  And we later confirmed they did have. See, sometimes it's not just because they're getting news reporting wrong.
[3:28:16.520 --> 3:28:19.520]  It's because key stuff is coming out early dummies.
[3:28:19.520 --> 3:28:23.520]  So maybe it's you that doesn't know about news reporting.
[3:28:23.520 --> 3:28:26.520]  You know about reporting on Twitter all day, which is fine.
[3:28:26.520 --> 3:28:32.520]  But, you know, no need, no need to get jealous of info wars dot com.
[3:28:32.520 --> 3:28:35.520]  Just wait till we re up and redesign the site, which is coming soon.
[3:28:35.520 --> 3:28:37.520]  You'll really hate us.
[3:28:37.520 --> 3:28:43.520]  So again, that's some of the news up on info wars dot com and present planet dot com real fast Jeffrey in Connecticut.
[3:28:43.520 --> 3:28:46.520]  You think it might be faked? A lot of folks are saying it.
[3:28:46.520 --> 3:28:55.520]  Yeah, I do because it's I don't know, like a lot of the news that I see right now is this it seems so fake.
[3:28:55.520 --> 3:28:59.520]  And then like, they'll change it like first with one shooter, then it was two, then it was three.
[3:28:59.520 --> 3:29:04.520]  Then they said four, then they like I did one person and said he wasn't the shooter.
[3:29:04.520 --> 3:29:06.520]  So it's like how this is like CNN.
[3:29:06.520 --> 3:29:10.520]  How can you mess up the news like that?
[3:29:10.520 --> 3:29:17.520]  Well, look, CNN has been caught doing fake newscasts from Atlanta that they said were in Iraq before under nerve gas attack.
[3:29:17.520 --> 3:29:25.520]  And they sent a live feed out, not on the TV, but a live feed that can be picked up by satellite dishes of them making jokes about it.
[3:29:25.520 --> 3:29:26.520]  I mean, it's confirmed.
[3:29:26.520 --> 3:29:29.520]  So yes, they've been caught lying before they do lie all the time.
[3:29:29.520 --> 3:29:31.520]  They distort reality.
[3:29:31.520 --> 3:29:32.520]  So the whole thing could be fake.
[3:29:32.520 --> 3:29:36.520]  But regardless, you're going to think these 12 dead is the end of the world.
[3:29:36.520 --> 3:29:40.520]  Who cares about thousands missing in Colorado by the time they're done with it?
[3:29:40.520 --> 3:29:46.520]  The mind control is the hyping something that's so incredibly rare, but they're coming after our guns.
[3:29:46.520 --> 3:30:10.520]  And Obama says 80% of you supported even though you don't.
