[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.080]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to break exclusive information on this Saturday afternoon.
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:34.280]  We have just shot more than three hours of interviews in this special emergency report.
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.880]  But during the shooting, I was contacted by a major investigative journalist who's broken
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:46.240]  hundreds of major stories, and he's going to be exclusively breaking tomorrow on my
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.740]  Sunday show, 4 to 6 p.m., the following information.
[00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.600]  He has the government documents, plus it's all backed up in UN statements and other
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.960]  health minister statements around the world.
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:04.460]  The UN is in control of the global health response and is directing Biden with these
[00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.400]  strike force teams to go into houses forcibly, particularly public housing where they can
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:17.360]  violate people's rights easier, and screen everyone forcibly with PCR tests with contact
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.040]  tracer strike teams.
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.520]  And if they don't agree to it, they're going to try to evict them, throw them out, or arrest
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.520]  them.
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.520]  It's been happening in Australia.
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.520]  It's been happening in Canada.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.540]  It's been happening all over the world, and it's all UN-directed.
[00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.200]  And so now they're bringing this here.
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.720]  It's the holy grail of the UN in charge of global health, global health response, setting
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.880]  the policy for worldwide lockdowns that have already starved more than 20 million people.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.680]  And it's just so diabolical.
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.840]  All over the world, major corporations that are part of the Davos Group are calling for
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.040]  a medical passport to be able to buy and sell.
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.160]  And Klaus Schwab, the head, says they want implantable microchips and force inoculations.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.140]  In fact, Biden's now talking about force inoculations.
[00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.140]  The UK is.
[00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.140]  The EU is.
[00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.140]  France.
[00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.140]  It's all here.
[00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.720]  And they admit these injections don't protect you from COVID.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.400]  It's the perfect takeover plan.
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.700]  It's all in operation lockstep.
[00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:17.080]  So tomorrow, 4 p.m., we're going to be breaking this information, 4 p.m. central, with the
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.080]  documents.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.800]  And I'm going to collate and get together all the other admissions and documents that
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.800]  are public from the U.N. and how this is being rolled out and what you can expect.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.120]  The good news is Senator Ted Cruz and others are backlashing and saying we're passing bills
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.420]  or introducing bills where you can't do contact tracers.
[00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.100]  You can't grab people out of their houses.
[00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.400]  But some states in the U.S. still have eugenics laws on the books.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.380]  Decker Carlson talked about it last week, where they can take you and sterilize you
[00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.980]  with no judge or jury.
[00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.440]  So eugenics laws are still there from 100 years ago, 120 years ago.
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.160]  Margaret Sanger got them on the books.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.240]  I had Michael Malice on the Friday show talking about that.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.160]  He came back on the day to talk more about it.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.160]  That's coming up.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.160]  But this is it.
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.800]  On a scale of 1 to 10, this is a 10.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.900]  It's so out of control.
[00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:00.900]  It's so evil.
[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:08.560]  So you're about to see the special 3-plus-hour transmission with Michael Malice, Nick Fuentes,
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.520]  Andrew Torba, and so much more.
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.140]  But please understand, this is making or breaking time.
[00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.480]  This is when they're making their move.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.560]  Oh, and finally, tomorrow I'll also cover what I predicted on Thursday when the, quote,
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.540]  gay choir in San Francisco broke.
[00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.920]  And it's 100 dudes or so saying, we're coming for your children.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.160]  We're going to corrupt them.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.160]  We're going to groom them.
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.600]  We're going to take them over.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.600]  Remember all that?
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.520]  I said, they need to run a background check on all these people and find out how many
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.320]  of them are convicted child molesters.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.140]  And it turns out a whole bunch of the names match specifically to that and aliases.
[00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.140]  So it needs to be investigated.
[00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.140]  It needs to be looked at.
[00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.140]  We've got a big article on Infowars.com showing that from the Western Journalism Center, and
[00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.480]  a lot of others are working on this as well.
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.540]  But this is really global tyranny wrapped in the rainbow flag, pedophilia wrapped in
[00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.060]  the rainbow flag, the destruction of our youth wrapped in the rainbow flag, the destruction
[00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.500]  of our health wrapped in this rainbow flag, and an unapproved genetic engineering therapy
[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.380]  being forced on us to just set the precedent for anything to go.
[00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.700]  Remember, a month ago, the Senate would not pass a bill banning human-animal cloning,
[00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.620]  splicing humans and animals, because it's already been going on.
[00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.220]  They wouldn't even pass it.
[00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.780]  That's how much trouble we're in.
[00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.920]  Evil's making its move on every front with the censorship and the control and everything.
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.900]  But thanks to you, Paul Revere's, black, white, old, young, I love you all.
[00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.000]  We're in this together.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.460]  The signal is still getting out.
[00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.540]  So take this special feed.
[00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.780]  Take this intro clip here and share it on Twitter, Facebook, everywhere.
[00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.420]  Share it on your email, your text message.
[00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.140]  Have your friends over and show them this.
[00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.840]  And have them tune in tomorrow at 4 p.m. central.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.620]  And then whatever you do, please realize we're only on air because of your word of mouth,
[00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.360]  your prayers, and your support.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.300]  We've got big sales that end this Sunday, tomorrow.
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.780]  Free shipping, double Patriot, 20 store wide, 10% off water filters, 10% off storeable food,
[00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.100]  a bunch of other big discounts on the supplements and products.
[00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.160]  Those sales are going to end on Sunday.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.740]  We'll still have X2 for 40% off and 60% off the spray bottle.
[00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.300]  It's amazing.
[00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.300]  That will be our new sale.
[00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.300]  That's going to be key.
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.380]  But everything else ends this Sunday.
[00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.940]  So please check out infowarestore.com.
[00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.340]  I want to thank you all who've been supporters.
[00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.340]  You're the reason we're here.
[00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.020]  You're the reason we're saving all these lives.
[00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.860]  You're the reason the whole world's quote becoming Alex Jones and quote Tucker Carlson's
[00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.660]  Alex Jones and Joe Rogan's Alex Jones.
[00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.180]  No, no, they're not Alex Jones.
[00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.180]  They heard my warnings.
[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.180]  They looked at the proof.
[00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.820]  And now they're awake, just as awake as I am, because Tucker Carlson's looking at real
[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.520]  eugenics documents.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.240]  He's looking at the same thing I looked at all those years ago.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.900]  And now he's waking up completely and it's a chain reaction.
[00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.120]  We're doing it together.
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.760]  So thank you and thank God.
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:39.920]  Here is the main transmission.
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.320]  Really appreciate the crew coming in on Saturday to get this together.
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.160]  And I appreciate all these guests as well.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.040]  The Nick Fuentes was taped a few days ago when he was still here in Austin.
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.480]  He's since been banned on Twitter.
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.480]  So that's a powerful interview as well.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.720]  So please stay with us.
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.720]  Here's the transmission.
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.280]  What are we going to do again?
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.840]  You're going to take this feed and you're going to take the archive of this spanned
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.440]  out video and you're going to share it.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.440]  This is the mission.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.440]  I know you're going to accept it.
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.440]  Thank you so much.
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:14.120]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.120]  going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight.
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:25.520]  You better believe you've got one from the front lines of the information war.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.560]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:36.400]  And you have put us on the front lines on this Saturday, July 10th worldwide transmission.
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:42.480]  I hope all of you watching we'll take the live feed and the archive that's posted a
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.160]  band out video and share it to the four winds.
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.420]  And I want to commend this amazing crew for the hard work they're doing seven days a week.
[00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:50.940]  We're trying to hire more people.
[00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:55.160]  We're trying to expand, but it's just you that keeps us on air listeners.
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.160]  We love you.
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.160]  Okay.
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.160]  Coming up.
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.420]  I taped an interview yesterday with Nick Fuentes before he left Houston.
[00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.560]  He just got banned off Twitter.
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.800]  So we're going to air that first.
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.880]  And then we've got here in town, he's moving here.
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.800]  We have Michael Malice, amazing, really smart guy, one of the smartest guys I know.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.800]  He's going to be here.
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.960]  And then Andrew Torba, the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center called out call for his
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.560]  banning and Nick Fuentes, they want his physical site taken offline.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.360]  Oh, go build your own thing.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.360]  Not anymore.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.000]  Nick Fuentes has just got banned on Twitter.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.520]  Andrew Torba is going to respond to that.
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:33.960]  And then we've got Thomas in Florida, who's a caller, but more and more I want to elevate
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:38.600]  callers because there's a smart, he brought up a lot of documents I knew were true dealing
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.140]  with the end game of the globalist.
[00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:42.920]  So you want next decade's news today.
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:48.560]  You're going to get it today because we had him on for two segments on Thursday.
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.320]  It was not enough time.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.360]  And so he'll be joining us at the end of this transmission.
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:57.440]  But first here is the thought criminal.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.040]  I mean, if Nick Fuentes was David Duke, I'd say he gets his free speech.
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.120]  I don't like David Duke.
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.360]  He doesn't like me.
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.680]  Nick Fuentes is just an America first guy.
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.100]  And if I disagree with him, he has his rights.
[00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:13.080]  But he got banned off of Twitter because the Southern Poverty Law Center and the ADL asked
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.140]  why the hell is he online?
[00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:20.720]  So we went to breakfast yesterday morning before he left to Houston.
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.260]  And here is that interview with Nick Fuentes.
[00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:31.560]  And then we will come back with Michael Malice, Andrew Torba and Thomas from Florida on this
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:36.460]  special Saturday global transmission, which is going to reach a million people.
[00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:40.160]  But if you decide to share it and tell everybody you know to share it, you'll get 10 million
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.800]  views and that'll really piss the globalists off.
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:47.020]  So here's Nick Fuentes and I having breakfast yesterday.
[00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:53.000]  As we speak in a little town in Idaho, all the big tech giants are meeting with current
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.840]  and former U.S. intelligence operatives, figuring out how to create a monopoly.
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.320]  In their own words, they admit they're creating a posthuman world.
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:06.320]  They're telling us that we're obsolete, that we're non-essential and only their big tech
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.560]  companies, only their big box stores are allowed to operate.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:13.720]  And all these companies have pushed virtual meetings and working from home because then
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:18.080]  they can surveil everything you're saying and doing over these apps.
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.080]  And that's all come out.
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:23.600]  So this is the next level of the surveillance state, raping us digitally, forcing itself
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.600]  on us.
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.780]  And then the real world, the third dimension, they can put you on no fly list.
[00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:30.040]  They can take your banking away.
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:34.680]  They even have Antifa then beat you up if you dare go out and protest your second amendment
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.760]  or family values, anything.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:43.120]  So we're going to be talking to a real victim of this.
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.720]  This individual has been put on a no fly list two and a half months ago and they won't take
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.720]  him off the no fly list.
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.720]  He has no criminal record.
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:53.360]  He's Nick Fuentes and we're meeting him here at this little diner because this is a microcosm
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.520]  of people want little diners.
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.760]  People want small stores.
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.380]  People want mom and pop.
[00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:59.600]  The quality is always better.
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:04.600]  The ratings are always better, but the system declared places like this, non-essential.
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.960]  It was closed for six months and almost went out of business.
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:13.720]  It's Shoyer and Co, a little Louisiana style diner that you'd find in the 1950s.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:17.320]  And it used to be totally packed, but since the pandemic happened, I come here all the
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.320]  time.
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.480]  You could come in basically and there's hardly ever even anybody here.
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.660]  And so I hope they don't go out of business.
[00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:27.560]  This is over on South Cesar Chavez, first street in Austin, Texas.
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.800]  And there's hundreds of thousands of these businesses that went out of business.
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.240]  In fact, about half the small businesses, I guess millions in America went out of business.
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.320]  So I actually see Nick right over there.
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.320]  He just just walked up.
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.320]  Let's go talk to him.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:46.320]  Well, well, well, if it isn't my fellow thought criminal, Nick Fuentes.
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.320]  Good morning.
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.320]  Good to see you.
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.520]  Good to see you, brother.
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.160]  I wanted to meet you here while you were in town because this is just a classic old fashioned
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.160]  diner, barely in business.
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:58.080]  It used to be lines, Monday through Friday, weekends, you name it.
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:01.400]  Now I can come here on a Saturday and there's hardly anybody here.
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.080]  Just an example of the economic warfare.
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.840]  How is this non-essential?
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.280]  But how is a big box store essential?
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.920]  I mean, this is this is the real discrimination, Nick.
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.960]  And you have been a trooper about it.
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.680]  But my God, you had to drive to Texas, you told me over the phone.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:15.680]  That's right.
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:16.680]  Yeah, I took a road trip.
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:22.480]  Took me, I think, 30 hours to get from Chicago to the West Coast and then back through Texas.
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.480]  That's exactly right.
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:27.400]  And this is the kind of economic warfare and political warfare, too, going on not just
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:32.600]  against dissidents like you and I, but even against regular people, small business owners.
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:37.720]  We're all in this together, liberal, conservative, gay, straight, black, white, old, young.
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.760]  Let's see if this little side door is open because I come here all the time because I'm
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:41.760]  letting the secret out.
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:45.440]  But I do want to see this place, you know, stay in business.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.440]  Here's a little side door.
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.440]  I mean, they'd rather you go in the front.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.440]  So let's go in the front.
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:52.120]  But they got a great Airstream trailer out here and there's all sorts of little places
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:55.120]  like this that are no longer open in Austin anymore.
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:12:00.120]  So it's really, really, really sad what this place has.
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:03.120]  This place has a great patio.
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:07.120]  It's got a great bar out here.
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.120]  You got a old fashioned diner.
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.120]  Some of my crew is already here.
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.120]  They're meeting us here.
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:20.120]  I took the liberty of already ordering some food over the phone.
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.120]  Hi, how you doing?
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.120]  Lovely.
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.120]  Good to see you.
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.120]  Always.
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.120]  Thanks for everything.
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.120]  Have a seat, my friend.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.120]  All right, thank you.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.120]  Again, some of my crew is already here.
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.120]  I'm a little bit late.
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:34.120]  They've already ordered some food, but a little piece of America right here, my friend.
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.120]  Yeah, it looks great.
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.120]  It's a pretty classic place here.
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.120]  And a little piece of America right here.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.120]  So what's front and center for you?
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:44.120]  I know that you were going to go to Arizona, but Cancel Culture attacked that as well.
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.120]  That's right.
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:49.120]  I was supposed to be in Phoenix for a fundraiser with Representative Paul Gosar, actually,
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:54.120]  who's a friend of ours and I think one of the best congressmen in America, by the way.
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:59.120]  He's been totaling on top of the Ashley Babbitt shooting and the Capitol riot and the persecution
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.120]  of patriots after that.
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.120]  So we were supposed to have a fundraiser in Phoenix with him.
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.120]  And this is normal political activism, you know.
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.120]  We're supposed to live in a democracy.
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.120]  We're supposed to live in a free society.
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:13.120]  We're engaging with the democratic institutions.
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:16.120]  We're engaging with an elected representative and doing a fundraiser.
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:21.120]  And so when word got out that I was doing a fundraiser with Representative Gosar, Jake Tapper,
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:28.120]  ADL, SPLC, all the usual suspects came out and called it anti-Semitic, white nationalist,
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.120]  racist, that kind of thing.
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:36.120]  And forced us into basically changing our plans with the fundraiser, postponing it until a later time.
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.120]  And we're going to have to change basically the entire way that we're going to do it.
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:44.120]  But, you know, it's kind of amazing because I don't know exactly what they expect patriots to do.
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.120]  We're part of this country.
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:48.120]  75 million people voted for Donald Trump.
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.120]  And they tell us, well, you can't talk online.
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:55.120]  You can't get elected to Congress or to any other political office.
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.120]  You can't fundraise for people that are already in political office.
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:02.120]  What exactly are we supposed to do to make the country the way that we want it to be?
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.120]  And let's expand on that.
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.120]  You're an America first guy.
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.120]  You're not even anti-Israel.
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.120]  I'm not anti-Israel.
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:12.120]  But the fact that we have Biden literally bowing to the Israeli prime minister now,
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.120]  I thought that was fake.
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.120]  Turns out it's true.
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:19.120]  I thought it was like a fake story where they said that they took Martin Luther King's bust out of the White House when Trump got in.
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.120]  That wasn't true.
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.120]  This was true.
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.120]  So it becomes a little bizarre when that's something you can't criticize.
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.120]  And I believe in free speech.
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.120]  But I know what you've said.
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:29.120]  I know what you've done.
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.120]  It's not white nationalism.
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.120]  It's not racist.
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.120]  But they even try to say Tucker Carlson's a white supremacist.
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.120]  They even try to say I'm a white supremacist.
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:40.120]  When I'm actually a classical liberal and love everybody, it's really, really dangerous.
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:50.120]  But now they're not just calling it the SPLC for the shutdown of Gab, which just lets everybody on, just like the Internet was just five years ago, three years ago.
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.120]  They now want to shut down Twitter.
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:58.120]  And the SPLC is writing letters to Congress, putting out big reports saying that somehow Twitter is this white supremacist thing.
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:03.120]  So really they want a total monopoly of where the public can gather and what we can say.
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:06.120]  And that's the real clear and present danger.
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:08.120]  That's the closest thing to Nazis I've seen in this country.
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.120]  Yeah, that's exactly it.
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:17.120]  And it started out, I think, years ago when they would say, well, hate speech is when you hate these protected groups, these people based on their immutable traits.
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:21.120]  And I think there was some consensus that, you know, that that's wrong or something.
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.120]  But you're exactly right.
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:29.120]  Now it's expanded that Donald Trump is a white supremacist who's dangerous and should be banned on Twitter and people like yourself and people like me.
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:33.120]  And it's even at this point, people that are not even white that they're calling white supremacist.
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.120]  You know, I'll give you a perfect example.
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:39.120]  I hosted the America First political action conference earlier this year.
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.120]  It had Michelle Malkin speaking there.
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.120]  Michelle Malkin is, I believe, Filipina.
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.120]  She's Asian.
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.120]  It had John Miller speaking there from Blaze TV.
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.120]  He's black.
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.120]  He's African-American.
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.120]  And so we have this conference where everybody is represented.
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:55.120]  There's all different kinds of groups speaking that are attending.
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.120]  And the message of the conference was this.
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:03.120]  I said about the conference that America is going to be a multiracial country, that just something that's happening.
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:06.120]  We're going to have to figure out how to get along together.
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:12.120]  But if that's going to work, people have got to treat everybody equally with rights, respect and dignity and all of that.
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:19.120]  They cut out a few sections of my speech and try to portray me then as some kind of a bigot, white supremacist, white nationalist.
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.120]  It's just dishonest.
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.120]  And we know what that's about.
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.120]  It's about shutting down patriots.
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:28.120]  It's about shutting down anybody that's an opponent of the American regime.
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.120]  Well, they say Candace Owens is a white supremacist.
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.120]  That's right.
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:35.120]  Candace Owens and Michelle Malkin and all kinds of other people.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.120]  It makes no sense.
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.120]  We know what it's really about.
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:40.120]  It's about shutting down American nationalism.
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.120]  That's what they oppose at the end of the day.
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:45.120]  Talk about what it's like to be on a no-fly list.
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:50.120]  Well, you know, at first I wasn't even sure if I was on the no-fly list.
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:58.120]  I actually, to go to my AFPAC conference in Florida earlier this year, I drove just out of an abundance of caution
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:02.120]  because I had heard from people that you can't check if you're on the no-fly list.
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.120]  There's no way.
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:07.120]  I mean, a lot of people think that you go to a certain website and you type your name in
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:12.120]  and you do some kind of a search engine and it tells you you're on the no-fly list.
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:13.120]  It doesn't work like that.
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:17.120]  The way that it works is you show up to the airport ready to travel.
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.120]  You've booked a flight.
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:20.120]  You've paid your money and all of that.
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:23.120]  And they will tell you at the gate you can't fly.
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:24.120]  They don't tell you why.
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:25.120]  They don't tell you you're on a list.
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:30.120]  They don't tell you any other information other than you're just not going to be able to fly.
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:33.120]  So I had suspected I was on the no-fly list.
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:39.120]  It wasn't until April when I tried to go to Florida for a press conference that I showed up to the airport
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:42.120]  thinking I could fly and found out that I wasn't going to be able to.
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:47.120]  And since then it's been, you know, to say the least, a massive inconvenience.
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.120]  You know, I've had to miss weddings.
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.120]  I've had to miss baby showers.
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:53.120]  I've had to miss all kinds of different things.
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:58.120]  And the big issue here is it's purely Orwellian where they don't even tell you how you're on it, how to get off.
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.120]  I know your food's getting cold.
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.120]  Let's have this breakfast.
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:06.120]  We've got some flies attacking and then we'll come back and finish this up with Nick Fuentes.
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:08.120]  Knowledge is power.
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:14.120]  And by simply clicking below and sharing this link, you override big tech and the global sensors.
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.120]  So please take action now.
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:24.120]  From the front lines of the information world, it's Alex Jones.
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.120]  Info Wars!
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:37.120]  And we are back with a real political dissident, the evil, the infamous Nick Fuentes.
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:41.120]  All right, we just ate our little breakfast here in southeast Austin
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:45.120]  in one of these evil, non-essential, small mom and pop places.
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:49.120]  So back to this incredible dehumanization.
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:53.120]  If this can happen to Nick Fuentes being banned from flying and not just the inconvenience,
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:59.120]  the unlawfulness of this, the fact that it's draconian, the fact you don't know how you get on it, how you get off of it.
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:07.120]  I mean, that's the definition of the book that inspired 1984 was, you know, the whole Kafkaesque situation where he's on trial.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:09.120]  They won't say what he's on trial for.
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.120]  I mean, that's what this is here.
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:20.120]  If there's one to a hundred in tyranny, putting you on a no-fly list that you can't get off of and won't tell you why you're on is a hundred.
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.120]  Yeah, and this is what they're doing in China.
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.120]  This is what they did in the Soviet Union.
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.120]  That's exactly right.
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:32.120]  And that's the nature of it, too, is this is political terrorism is what it is, the terrorism that comes from the state
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:33.120]  because they restrict your liberties.
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.120]  They restrict your rights.
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:39.120]  And in particular, in my case, freedom of movement, freedom of travel across the country.
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:41.120]  And they won't tell you that they're doing it.
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:43.120]  They won't tell you why they're doing it.
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.120]  They won't tell you the nature of it.
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:47.120]  And, you know, maybe the worst thing is that you can't fight it.
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:52.120]  And I think that's something really important for people to understand is that you can't fight the federal government,
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:59.120]  the federal government, which we've created over the past 20 years in particular since 9-11 and since the war on terror,
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:03.120]  the national security apparatus, the intelligence agencies, the Patriot Act.
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:04.120]  This stuff is unbeatable.
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:10.120]  Once the FBI, DHS, the various agencies set their sights on you, you're finished.
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.120]  You're crushed.
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.120]  You're sort of at their mercy.
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:19.120]  And so ever since I got put on the no-fly list, people have said, well, you must be able to file a lawsuit or do an application.
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.120]  And we're looking into that.
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.120]  We're going to file a lawsuit against the federal government.
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:26.120]  But this is something that hasn't even been adjudicated for 60 years.
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.120]  They just don't do cases on this.
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:31.120]  And you have very limited options for recourse.
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:35.120]  So people have to understand before it gets too late that we have to shut this down now,
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:39.120]  because if we get to the point where the federal government can do this to anybody and everybody,
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.120]  and once that becomes commonplace, there's no resisting it.
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:43.120]  There's no fighting back against it.
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.120]  So I'm the canary in the coal mine.
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.120]  It happened to me first.
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:48.120]  We have to fight it now.
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.120]  Well, that's right.
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:54.120]  And again, we've had six, seven big banks taken from us.
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.120]  One I had since I was in high school.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:58.120]  Perfect corporate credit.
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:01.120]  I mean, perfect, as good as it gets.
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.120]  We were paying like 1.7% on credit card transactions.
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:06.120]  Nobody gets that, because we just didn't do chargebacks.
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.120]  We would just eat them.
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.120]  Perfect credit, corporate credit.
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:14.120]  And they just said, you've been put on a hate listing by a thing called G2.
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:17.120]  It's basically part of Interpol and the CIA out of Boston.
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:21.120]  And we were sent by internal bankers the leaked information.
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:23.120]  And I had perfect credit.
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:26.120]  And then they say, hate group, no judge, no jury.
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:28.120]  This intelligence group says it.
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:31.120]  And then I go to the lowest credit there is.
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:38.120]  And so then I've got to go and literally find like offshore third world banks or whatever.
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:42.120]  To be able to operate and to take people's orders.
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:46.120]  Then, of course, I pay a higher percentage on the credit card transaction.
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:51.120]  So this is the digital gulag they put you in before they put you into the physical prison.
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:55.120]  So there's a process in tyranny under communists and under fascists.
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:56.120]  That's being followed.
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:58.120]  And this is really a fascist system.
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:01.120]  They use communism as the operating system for the general public.
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:05.120]  But the merger of corporate power and state power is fascism.
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.120]  And that's what's happened here.
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.120]  We're sitting here with Nick Fuentes and it's happened to.
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:13.120]  And even if Nick Fuentes was a white supremacist or a black supremacist or whatever.
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:16.120]  Or he was in Metro or La Raza, Hispanic radical groups.
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:18.120]  He has a right to exist and have a bank account and live.
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:23.120]  And not have secret lists put out that then ban him across the banking industry.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.120]  Because he's been listed as a terrorist.
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:28.120]  And that's what Biden has said is Operation Choke Point.
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:32.120]  They're going after members of Congress, like the great lady from Georgia.
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:37.120]  And they go, oh, my gosh, you know, she has a tab account.
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:39.120]  She's talking to people.
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.120]  Well, yeah, and she's in Congress.
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:43.120]  So Congress has to get together and say no to this.
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:47.120]  Because they're even censoring congressional hearings and Senate hearings.
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:52.120]  With medical experts about randesivir and hydroxychloroquine and things like that.
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:57.120]  Since when do the corporations say what medical doctors can testify about in Congress?
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.120]  There's no end to this.
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:01.120]  So the first domino is the KKK.
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:02.120]  And, you know, then it's some other group.
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:03.120]  But then it's Alex Jones.
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:04.120]  And then it's Nick Fuentes.
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:07.120]  And then it's members of Congress.
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:08.120]  I mean, this is here.
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.120]  It's not coming.
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.120]  It's here.
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:12.120]  Nick Fuentes, what do you expect your next moves to be?
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:15.120]  Well, I expect the next move to be ratcheting up all of this.
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:19.120]  It's everything that we've seen since the Capitol has happened in such a short window of time.
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:24.120]  It was just a year ago that I don't think anybody had heard of this level of legal persecution.
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:26.120]  A year ago, the worst that we saw was tech censorship.
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:33.120]  But what you're going to see in the future is total financial deplatforming, total financial blacklisting.
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.120]  It's going to be major banks shutting down people's bank accounts.
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:41.120]  It's going to be banks shutting down corporate business accounts, which is already happening, but is going to expand.
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:43.120]  You're going to see more legal persecution.
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:45.120]  And they're already talking about it.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.120]  DHS, FBI, Capitol Police.
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:53.120]  They're all going to be working together to surveil people that are even talking about the wrong things.
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:24:01.120]  And DHS said this year that they're going to start using private contractors to send in informants to spy on private groups,
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:08.120]  on Telegram, Facebook, social media companies to monitor, quote, emerging narratives that challenge the American regime.
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:13.120]  Well, they've already had the Pentagon doing that, and they put out this report saying gun owners and veterans,
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:17.120]  people that question elections, question lockdowns are the new terrorists.
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:20.120]  And so by that definition, they say all of our American rights are swept away.
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:25.120]  So this is a major corporate revolution against America because Trump scared them so much.
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:26.120]  You can say what you want about Trump.
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:27.120]  He scared them.
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.120]  He was a maverick.
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:29.120]  He got in.
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.120]  Even the Chinese state media has symposiums saying, oh, we got rid of Trump.
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:34.120]  He really worked for the American people.
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.120]  But ah, we now own the American elite.
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:37.120]  We're in control.
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:41.120]  I mean, it's such a paradox to know all of this.
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:47.120]  And it's not even debated at the CFR or Trilateral Commission level or Club of Rome or Davos Group.
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.120]  They write white papers.
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.120]  You can go read them on their websites bragging about world government.
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.120]  They're going to put microchips in us.
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.120]  They're going to break our families up.
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.120]  They're going to make us obsolete.
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.120]  They're going to take our businesses away.
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:57.120]  I mean, it's just a total declaration of war.
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:00.120]  But then the New York Times, if you talk about it, says you're racist and evil.
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.120]  They go, why is Alex Jones about globalism?
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:03.120]  That's that's racism.
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:05.120]  That's a code word for something.
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:10.120]  No, they call themselves globalists, meaning global corporate government ruling above the law.
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:11.120]  Exempt.
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:14.120]  So, Nick, let's talk about this.
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:18.120]  How do you see a coalition forming against this?
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.120]  I know you've talked about it.
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.120]  I've talked about it.
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:26.120]  Governors, legislatures, other corporations that see what's happening and say, hey, we're still American.
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:28.120]  We still believe in freedom.
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:33.120]  And really us all signaling who we are instead of the cowering and hiding who we are.
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.120]  We all signal who we are and come together.
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:37.120]  I like the fact that Bongino has come out.
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:42.120]  He said he had a sponsor a year ago that, oh, we've got a payment processor and all the systems for you.
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.120]  As long as you're not criminal, we want you.
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:46.120]  So I came to a sponsor and they said, no, we're not dealing with Alex Jones.
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.120]  And I said, oh, that's a fraud.
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:50.120]  But Bongino, that was just a sponsor.
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:51.120]  I didn't blame Bongino.
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.120]  Literally, we launched his career.
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:54.120]  He's a great guy, very articulate, very successful.
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:58.120]  You know, he won't give us the time of day now that he's, you know, the big Fox News guy, which is fine.
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.120]  But I like him.
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:06.120]  But if we put in our applications and things with them through the system and if they don't do it.
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:16.120]  I'm going to really take action because there's only one thing more able than big tech corporate media censoring people and blackballing people and putting us in digital ghettos and trying to destroy us.
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:24.120]  It's saying that you are America and that you are going to support freedom and you are going to back it and then not doing it, which I don't think he's going to do.
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:26.120]  But already with a sponsor, they wouldn't take us.
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.120]  He says this is his business partner.
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:29.120]  This is real.
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.120]  So we're the litmus test.
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:37.120]  I'm letting everybody know right here because the answer is that is we take gap just three, four years ago.
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:41.120]  They had the idiot white supremacist with all their stupid stuff on Facebook and Twitter.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.120]  Almost no one was listening to them.
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:45.120]  Most of the stuff they were saying wasn't even true.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.120]  They were making up and exaggerating things.
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:48.120]  They were lying about me.
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:49.120]  They were saying everybody was Jewish.
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:51.120]  That wasn't whatever.
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:55.120]  It's their right to say that, you know, dinosaurs didn't exist or whatever.
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:57.120]  It's their right to say the earth flat.
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:02.120]  But to then extrapolate out that if you criticize Israel or a war they launched that you're that.
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:04.120]  So you should be lose your bank account.
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:05.120]  That is a tyranny.
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:12.120]  And so that's that's that's the Jewish lobby and the left and Israel creating a real beef with people that I don't want.
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:19.120]  That is a fraud and very dangerous and being used by the big corporations to be kind of the icebreaker to get these draconian controls in place.
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:24.120]  So let's talk here about a strategic spend five minutes here.
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:30.120]  The liberals are close to others wearing their mask outside about strategically the battle line.
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:37.120]  People better choose a side because it's being corralled and intimidated and just, OK, I will promote the American flag.
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.120]  I will promote borders.
[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:44.120]  Don't you know, don't call me a name and just get over it like you've done to cross that I've done and say this is a fraud.
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:51.120]  I'm not going to be thought policed by your intimidation because the danger of my silence is that no one's going to know you're attacking me.
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:52.120]  Well, that's well said.
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:57.120]  And that is one of the biggest problems is not even just the people that are raping America and wrecking the country.
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:03.120]  It is the people that come out in defense purportedly of America and of the American people.
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:06.120]  But they act just the same as the enemies.
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.120]  They act as gatekeepers.
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:11.120]  They act as traitors, censors in the same way that the enemy does.
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:18.120]  And they will come to you waving the American flag in the name sometimes of America first, of patriotism, of things like that.
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:22.120]  And then they go and they do the same thing, the same tactics as the left.
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:30.120]  And so I think first and foremost, primarily what we as patriots have to do is have some clarity of purpose of who we are, what we're doing.
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:32.120]  A new declaration of independence.
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:38.120]  That's right. A new declaration of independence for America and define who's on our side and who's on the other side.
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.120]  The good thing is the issue is being forced.
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:45.120]  It's harder and harder now to obscure what you're really about.
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:54.120]  In other words, it's more difficult for people to hide if they're fake patriots because people are starting to see on these critical issues, things like, you know, Joe Biden bowing down to Israel.
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:56.120]  That's forcing the issue.
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:00.120]  If you're America first, you would say no matter what, there's something wrong with that.
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:05.120]  You know, you may not dislike Israel, you may like Israel, whatever, but there's something wrong with that.
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:11.120]  If you're not America first, you might defend something like that or say that people who have a problem with that are anti-Semitic.
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:19.120]  So the issues being forced, people are waking up, but that's primarily what has to happen is we have to identify who is a patriot, who's America first and who isn't.
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:25.120]  Once that's happened, we have to begin to mobilize and organize for our political interest.
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:31.120]  The biggest problem that we have right now is not a shortage of people that know what's going on in the country and know the relevant facts.
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:35.120]  Patriots are waking up. Alex Jones and Infowars are mainstream now.
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:37.120]  Tucker Carlson is mainstream.
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.120]  Donald Trump was the president of the United States.
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:42.120]  75 million plus people voted for him.
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:44.120]  America wants this.
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:47.120]  Absolutely. America wants change.
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:48.120]  You say it's inevitable.
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:50.120]  That's right. America first is inevitable.
[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:54.120]  And that's because people hate the system. The system doesn't work for us.
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:57.120]  And they try to act like it's only a conservative thing or a Christian thing.
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:03.120]  It's a common sense thing to want free market in America and sovereignty versus global corporate fascism?
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:06.120]  Well, that's the wellspring that creates all the fruits of what we see here.
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:10.120]  You know, people say, oh, it's a white nationalist thing to want to support America.
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:15.120]  America benefits everybody. That's why everybody wants to come here because America is a great place.
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:18.120]  This is Western civilization. This is the place that people want to be.
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:23.120]  Preserving that is not only in the interest of, like you said, conservatives or Christians or white people.
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:25.120]  It is in the interest of everybody.
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:29.120]  And that's why the big corporations, this is the key we just said, are demonizing Western civilization
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:35.120]  because they're exporting globalism, corporate rule, divide and conquer, eugenics, depopulation,
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:38.120]  forced inoculations, surveillance states.
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:43.120]  And an American system and people being upwardly mobile and free, and it's not about what color you are,
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.120]  it's about the character of your deeds and what you produce,
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:49.120]  that is totally opposed to their corporate global system.
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:54.120]  That's why it's got to be destroyed because they don't want Americana being exported, what I call 1776 worldwide.
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:59.120]  Instead, they want to demonize the idea of America and demonize anything that's associated with freedom
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:02.120]  to then outlaw freedom worldwide.
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:07.120]  We can't coexist. Western civilization cannot coexist with globalist technocratic rule.
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:13.120]  They know that. They know that having a strong middle class, having strong families, the Constitution,
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:17.120]  the right to bear arms can't coexist with the kind of slave state that they're trying to create.
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:24.120]  They want everyone to live in cities, renting everything, constantly under surveillance, no privacy, no rights.
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:28.120]  And they know that that can't coexist with the system where there's manufacturing,
[00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:30.120]  where people own the fruits of their labor.
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:35.120]  Where people know how to do things. It's not just that we can manufacture, it's that we know how to do it.
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:37.120]  You understand? That's what scares them.
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:40.120]  Absolutely. And that's why in China, they're stealing the know-how.
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:44.120]  They build the factories over there and then Chinese know how to manufacture and create everything.
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:48.120]  In America, we don't know how to use anything. We don't know how to make anything.
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:54.120]  They're creating a docile, stupid, low IQ population of people that are not going to hold the government accountable,
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:59.120]  that are not going to resist the whims of the globalist club at Davos or various other groups.
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:01.120]  And now we know what comes out of that.
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:05.120]  Before they butchered a sheep in the EU, they hit it with electricity to stun it.
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:10.120]  That's ethical, they call that moral, instead of just going right at them and killing them.
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:18.120]  And so that's the issue is, we're being drugged and anesthetized and stunned before they move in with the final kill.
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:20.120]  And that's why they attack men in general.
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:25.120]  Because it's been men that have risen and challenged other corrupt men throughout history that bring in these tyrannies.
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:31.120]  If we're unable to defeat them, what is the timetable right now with the forced inoculations, the contact?
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:34.120]  People ask all over the internet, I mean we trended again like yesterday on Twitter,
[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:37.120]  like how did Alex Jones predict they're coming to our houses next?
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:39.120]  Because they freaking said that was the plan.
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:44.120]  What is this thing about people where they don't want to look a year or two years ahead
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:46.120]  and then when somebody that tells them before, they think it's magic.
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:49.120]  When it's not magic, the whole globalist plan is public.
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:52.120]  It's conformity. It's all about social conformity.
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:56.120]  Because you're right, they're out there openly stating their agenda and they have been for years.
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:58.120]  They have been actually for decades.
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:01.120]  And if you look hard enough, it's really not that difficult to find.
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:04.120]  You'll see exactly what they're saying about their plans for us.
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:10.120]  The problem is that people watch TV and they watch NBC and they watch Fox and CBS and all of that.
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:15.120]  And if nobody else is saying that at their workplace or their school or on TV, they tune it out.
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:18.120]  They say, oh, that's a conspiracy. That's a disreputable source.
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:20.120]  If somebody's got speech, it ends the gaslighting.
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:25.120]  Did you see the Canadian health official over the whole province, Nova Scotia, say,
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:33.120]  oh, we can't even allow people to have free speech because we can't allow the lockdowns to end
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:36.120]  because they'll meet and they'll talk and challenge our narrative.
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:37.120]  We'll play that clip right now.
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:53.120]  So, I mean, I think it's still there.
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:58.120]  We still have, you know, bringing large numbers of people together.
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:01.120]  It can present some risk.
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:03.120]  We'll continue to look at that.
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:15.120]  But I think the other purpose of the injunction is to prevent groups that are deliberately spreading false information
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:18.120]  that can actually create risk.
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:22.120]  The information itself, if listened to, creates risk to the public as well.
[00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:28.120]  And that certainly is a need to manage that misinformation campaign as well.
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:29.120]  I mean, here's an example.
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:33.120]  This is a liberal area of Austin we came to.
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:34.120]  Those folks, two guys came in.
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.120]  They saw who I was.
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:36.120]  They're like 20 feet away.
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:40.120]  They got up and left because the left does not want to hear any outside ideas.
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:42.120]  It's like Fauci says, I am science.
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:45.120]  Don't question me even though all the science shows you're a fraud.
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:46.120]  Sorry to interrupt. Go ahead.
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:47.120]  No, you're absolutely right.
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:48.120]  And it's true.
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:49.120]  People don't want to hear these ideas.
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:50.120]  People don't want to hear.
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:51.120]  They don't want to trust their own eyes.
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:53.120]  They don't want to trust their own ears.
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:56.120]  People want to go about their lives, get pumped full of chemicals.
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:58.120]  That is people already in the trance.
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:34:59.120]  How do we get them out of the trance?
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:01.120]  Well, I think there are enough people that are out of it.
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:03.120]  But basically, we have to bring the message to them.
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:04.120]  We have to provoke them.
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:05.120]  We have to agitate them.
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:08.120]  Not in a way that's violent or illegal or anything like that.
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:10.120]  But we've got to make our voices heard.
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:11.120]  We've got to be vocal.
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:14.120]  For example, the Stop the Steal movement was working.
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:18.120]  That's why they came up with that Capitol false flag on January 6th.
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:21.120]  Because you had patriots coming out to the Capitol peacefully,
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:26.120]  assembling, protesting, streaming in every state capital for months
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:28.120]  after the November 3rd election.
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:30.120]  And I think that terrified them because people are coming out
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:34.120]  and they weren't saying, you know, rah, rah, rah, vote for Republicans
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:35.120]  and don't vote for Democrats.
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:38.120]  They were coming out and saying the whole system is rigged.
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:39.120]  The whole system is illegitimate.
[00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:40.120]  They stole the election.
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:44.120]  Not just the government, not just the party, but the corporations, too.
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:46.120]  And they came out and said that in Time Magazine about a month
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:47.120]  after the inauguration.
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:51.120]  They said this was the big global conspiracy to fix the election,
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:53.120]  to, quote, unquote, save democracy.
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:56.120]  Is that the great part, though, is the criminals love to brag?
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:57.120]  Oh, yeah.
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:00.120]  And, well, that makes it, I think, a little bit easier for us
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:03.120]  because, you know, I know you went on Joe Rogan recently
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:04.120]  and it was a little bit funny.
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:06.120]  He said, oh, you know, let's get a fact check on that.
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:07.120]  Let's get a fact check on that.
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:10.120]  And every single thing that Alex Jones says, fact check comes back
[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:12.120]  and says, oh, he's right about this, he's right about this,
[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:14.120]  he's right about that, he's right about that.
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:18.120]  And so if we have the level playing field, if we have basically the megaphone
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:22.120]  to get the message out there, anybody who listens and is reasonable
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:25.120]  and is willing to come out of the trance will be able to do that
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:28.120]  because the facts at this point are unambiguous, indisputable,
[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:30.120]  maybe more so than ever before.
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:31.120]  That's right.
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:35.120]  This is about trance breaking.
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:40.120]  And if you had to see this as a football game at halftime,
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:43.120]  where is free humanity versus the technocrats
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:47.120]  versus the psychotic big tech bankers that are admittedly eugenicists?
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:49.120]  I mean, because that's the crazy thing.
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:50.120]  They're the ultimate anti-humans.
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:51.120]  They're beyond just racist.
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:53.120]  They think the general public is all scum.
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:56.120]  They believe the social Darwinism, the fact that they're in power
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:57.120]  means they can rule everybody.
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:59.120]  They write books saying we need to get rid of everybody,
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:01.120]  but then, oh, they love us, please take the shot,
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:04.120]  which admittedly is hurting so many people.
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:08.120]  How would you describe the unipolar world?
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:11.120]  Because I don't just see it as China and the U.S. as a political unipolar world,
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:14.120]  but the real ideological, is it unipolar?
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:16.120]  Is it multi-tripolar, quad-polar?
[00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:19.120]  I mean, what are the dominant poles, good versus evil?
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:21.120]  Obviously, there's a way to see it,
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:25.120]  but through what lens do you look at it beyond America first?
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:26.120]  Because America is important.
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:28.120]  We're 5% of the world population,
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:30.120]  but how do we reach out to others,
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:33.120]  liberal, conservative, old, young, gay, straight?
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.120]  I love everybody.
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:38.120]  I want to not transcend Trump.
[00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:42.120]  I just want to let people know that this is bigger than all these labels
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:44.120]  that they can trick us just to fight with each other.
[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:45.120]  Over labels, they win.
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:49.120]  I get that they create their false unity and say they don't have labels,
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:50.120]  but then they reimpose labels.
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:53.120]  That's a false form of liberalism, but you would call it,
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:56.120]  I would call it founding fathers, classical liberals.
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:38:01.120]  And so what is a classical liberal versus a modern liberal?
[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:02.120]  That's a lot I just threw out there.
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:05.120]  Well, first on the question of sort of internationally,
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:07.120]  I think that nationalism is rising worldwide.
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:09.120]  This is indisputable.
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:11.120]  At the time of the 2016 election, of course,
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:13.120]  you've got Donald Trump in America,
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:15.120]  but at the same time you have Brexit in the UK.
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:18.120]  You've got Matteo Salvini in Italy over the past five years.
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:22.120]  You've got Poland and Hungary becoming far more conservative
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:25.120]  and specifically Orban in Hungary articulating a new vision
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:27.120]  of Christian nationalism in Europe,
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:30.120]  which is maybe the first time in the 21st century
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:31.120]  that we've heard something like that.
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:33.120]  You've got Bolsonaro in Brazil.
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:36.120]  And so it's in the Western hemisphere, it's in Europe.
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:38.120]  You could see that nationalism is gaining traction.
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:41.120]  And even with the COVID protests or the COVID lockdown,
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:45.120]  there were protests worldwide, maybe more so even than in America,
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:48.120]  protests in Quebec, protests in the Netherlands,
[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:49.120]  protests all across Europe.
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:50.120]  Germany, millions.
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:52.120]  Germany, yeah, millions and millions of people
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:54.120]  not covered by the mainstream media.
[00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:57.120]  And so, you know, and to get even to the question about,
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:59.120]  you know, if we're in the halftime, where are we?
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:01.120]  I think it's closer than a lot of people think.
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:05.120]  And it's definitely closer than the globalists would like to let on.
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:06.120]  Patriots are rising up.
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:09.120]  And if we could achieve something like the Donald Trump election,
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:11.120]  and when you look at what's going on in Europe,
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:12.120]  they'll never cover that in the media.
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:15.120]  They'll never write a big piece about that in The New Yorker
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:17.120]  about how, you know, globalists are on the ropes,
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:18.120]  but they really are.
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:20.120]  And that's why they're acting out so desperately.
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:23.120]  That's why they're making these dramatic and very visible moves.
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:25.120]  Well, before they made their draconian move
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:27.120]  four and a half years ago when he won,
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:29.120]  they said, globalism actually is in trouble.
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:30.120]  We're falling apart.
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:33.120]  We've got to organize and take speech and really move against everybody.
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:35.120]  So they did do a few articles, you're right.
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:37.120]  But since then, they put on the Confidence Act.
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:39.120]  But in the Financial Times of London, other places,
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:41.120]  they actually did hit the alarm button.
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:43.120]  Yeah, oh, yeah, and they called it the democracy deficit.
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:46.120]  And they talked about the European Union was failing as a project
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:47.120]  and things of that nature.
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:48.120]  So you're right.
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:50.120]  Years ago, they were saying, oh, well, you know,
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:51.120]  we might be in some trouble.
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:53.120]  And ever since Trump rose up, now they have to say,
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:55.120]  oh, well, that's terrorism.
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:58.120]  Now it's the pretext for total globalism.
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:00.120]  And doesn't that show they're losing, that now they're calling
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:02.120]  questioning election or questioning lockdown as terrorism
[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:04.120]  and the official government policy?
[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:06.120]  I mean, to me, that shows weakness, not strength.
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:07.120]  It does. It does.
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:09.120]  Because if they were truly strong,
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:11.120]  if they really had control over the narrative,
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:12.120]  they wouldn't have to worry about it.
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:15.120]  But ultimately, I think it was confluence of different factors,
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:17.120]  maybe social media being one of them.
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:19.120]  But their monopoly over information,
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:22.120]  their monopoly over the sort of dialectic of politics
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:24.120]  has been totally shattered and broken.
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:27.120]  And that's why it's revolutionary to take this interview
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:30.120]  and share it and tune into my show, tune into his nightly show
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:33.120]  and to realize that just that revolutionary act of
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:35.120]  on your email list, on your text message,
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:37.120]  that's where they're having trouble censoring,
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:39.120]  or on Facebook or on Twitter or on YouTube,
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:43.120]  taking these clips, using this, it's all free to air,
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:45.120]  getting it out on Instagram, getting it out on Twitter,
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:46.120]  I see you doing it.
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:50.120]  And really having a debate, that's how we're going to win.
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:53.120]  In closing, I want people to learn how they can find you.
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:55.120]  It's not just, oh, when you see a Nick Fuentes clip,
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:57.120]  you watch it, it's when you believe in something,
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:59.120]  you know it's important, you promote it.
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:00.120]  That's 90% of the power.
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:03.120]  10% of us, 10% is us taking action.
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:06.120]  90% is you deciding to pay it forward
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:08.120]  and your real power turning that loose.
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:10.120]  But we were talking about this,
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.120]  and I'm going to play a clip of this right now
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:13.120]  as we're taping this.
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:18.120]  The official orchestra of the symphony in San Francisco
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:20.120]  is now gay.
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:21.120]  It calls itself that.
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:23.120]  And they say, we're coming for your children.
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:24.120]  We're recruiting them.
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:25.120]  We're going to take them over.
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:26.120]  They will work for us.
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:27.120]  They will be our slaves.
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:28.120]  They actually say this.
[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:30.120]  Total declaration of war.
[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:35.120]  And all it is is a cult that controls the media,
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:38.120]  that the corporation uses the rainbow flag as their power,
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:40.120]  knowing that people are open and free and are like,
[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:41.120]  sure, I'm not against you.
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:42.120]  But it's not about that.
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:44.120]  It's about a globalist corporate agenda
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:45.120]  that's wrapped itself in it.
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:49.120]  And in this video, they are declaring, we're coming.
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:50.120]  The future is ours.
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:51.120]  Your children belong to us.
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:53.120]  This is a group of men saying,
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:55.120]  we are going to form sexual relationships
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:56.120]  with your children.
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.120]  This is pedophilic.
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:02.120]  We are grooming the new generation of Americans
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:05.120]  to be fully embracing of diversity and inclusivity.
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:07.120]  And for the children and the people that support it
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:09.120]  are going to realize that this is going to be
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:11.120]  the grooming of the next generation.
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:13.120]  That's the whole goal is to make kids
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:15.120]  that aren't used to seeing something like me
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:17.120]  more comfortable just seeing it.
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:21.120]  No one's there to push an agenda on anyone.
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:26.120]  No one's there to persuade people or to recruit people.
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:28.120]  Who wants to be a drag queen when they grow up?
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:30.120]  You could be a drag queen superhero.
[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:35.120]  Learn to love, learn to vogue, face your fate.
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:38.120]  We'll convert your children.
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:42.120]  Someone's got to teach them not to hate.
[00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:46.120]  We're coming for them.
[00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:51.120]  We're coming for your children.
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:54.120]  We're coming for them.
[00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:57.120]  We're coming for your children.
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:43:02.120]  We're coming for them.
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:05.120]  Your children will care about fairness
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:07.120]  and justice for others.
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:10.120]  Your children will work to convert
[00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:12.120]  all their sisters and brothers.
[00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:17.120]  Then soon we're almost certain
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:23.120]  your kids will start converting too.
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:28.120]  The gay agenda is coming home.
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:33.120]  The gay agenda is here.
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:35.120]  But you don't have to worry.
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:38.120]  Because there's nothing wrong with standing by our side.
[00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:40.120]  Get on board and never worry.
[00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:43.120]  Because the world always needs a bit more pride.
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:46.120]  No, you don't have to worry.
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:49.120]  Because there's nothing wrong with standing by your side.
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:51.120]  Get on board and never worry.
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:54.120]  Because the world always needs a bit more pride.
[00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:59.120]  Come on, try a little pride.
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:02.120]  We'll convert your children.
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:04.120]  Then we'll turn to you.
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:06.120]  Giving up the fear inside.
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:09.120]  It's freeing like you never knew.
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:12.120]  Go and see San Francisco.
[00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:15.120]  Go and turn up that disco.
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:19.120]  You'll forget you were ever upset.
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:23.120]  We'll convert your children.
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:28.120]  And make an ally of you yet.
[00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:33.120]  We'll make an ally of you yet.
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:40.120]  We'll make an ally of you yet.
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:42.120]  And we have to warn you, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:44.120]  if you've got young or impressionable children
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:49.120]  in your household, bring them to the screen right now.
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:51.120]  And we witnessed parents taking their children
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:54.120]  as young as two inside to take part.
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:56.120]  Talking, singing, and reading.
[00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:58.120]  We can both be grooms.
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:02.120]  To an audience of preschoolers, toddlers, and their caregivers.
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:04.120]  Family programming!
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:06.120]  Love it, yes!
[00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:09.120]  We have just confirmed that a registered child sex offender
[00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:12.120]  has been reading to children at a Houston Public Library
[00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:15.120]  as part of its Drag Queen Story Hour.
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:17.120]  A media spokesperson for the library confirms
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:20.120]  one of those drag queens, Tatiana Malanina,
[00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:24.120]  is really Alberto Garza, a child sex offender.
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:27.120]  In 2008, he was convicted of assaulting an 8-year-old boy.
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:30.120]  This is Tatiana Malanina, my sister from Queens of the Week.
[00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:32.120]  People seem to walk away having a good time.
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:35.120]  Start them young, right?
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:39.120]  Now, does anybody in this room know how to twerk?
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:43.120]  And that really is the driving engine of this system.
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:46.120]  I knew Ted Gunderson, former top FBI agent.
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:48.120]  They wanted him to be the FBI director.
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:50.120]  He was the head of the whole Southern California sector.
[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:52.120]  I knew General Benton K. Parton,
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:54.120]  head of Air Force Weapons Development.
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:58.120]  I had family that was in the Iran-Contra and stuff
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:00.120]  in Central and South America,
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:03.120]  and they all told me, my uncle and people, when I was a kid,
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:05.120]  but then these other guys, I was on air when I was 22,
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:07.120]  like this guy, and they would come through and speak,
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:09.120]  and they would not have dinner with him,
[00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:11.120]  and they'd say, listen, it's devil worshipers.
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:14.120]  They use it as a mind-control system to get people recruited,
[00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:16.120]  and then once they've had sex with somebody's wife
[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:18.120]  and they have it with an underage girl,
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:20.120]  then it's a little kid, then they got to kill a kid
[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:22.120]  because, you know, this kid's a troublemaker.
[00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:24.120]  So, you know, you're compromised.
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:26.120]  Well, all that's come out now,
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:28.120]  is really externalizing this whole method,
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:30.120]  and it really is a horrible, sick operating system
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:32.120]  that took over the Vatican, that took over Penn State,
[00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:34.120]  that took over basically everything,
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:36.120]  the FBI, you name it.
[00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:38.120]  And so that's why they're doing this,
[00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:40.120]  is because this is a cult of sickos
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:43.120]  that are literally high on sucking the energy off children.
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:45.120]  This is vampirism, folks.
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:47.120]  This is psychic vampire stuff.
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:49.120]  And so physical vampires aren't real.
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:51.120]  They're archetypes, Bram Stoker said that,
[00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:54.120]  of real people that were doing bad things.
[00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:56.120]  They've always been these type of folks.
[00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:58.120]  And that's why in the old Transylvanian legends
[00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:00.120]  they said, don't get near the castle,
[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:02.120]  they'll grab you and eat you.
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:04.120]  Well, because the elites turned out
[00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:06.120]  were grabbing kids and eating them.
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:08.120]  That's in the history books now.
[00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:10.120]  And so you've got these domesticated people
[00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:12.120]  that don't realize how much danger they're in,
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:14.120]  and that there's these super predators
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:16.120]  that are organizing these hierarchies
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:18.120]  of super predator control,
[00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:20.120]  and everybody else is just scared,
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:22.120]  wanting to conform, conform, conform.
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:24.120]  And when you speak to that,
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:26.120]  and why these criminals love to brag,
[00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:28.120]  they first put out that video,
[00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:30.120]  and after it got about a million views
[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:32.120]  and 99% downvotes, they removed it off YouTube,
[00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:34.120]  we saved it, it's a banned video.
[00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:36.120]  But again, that shows they're miscalculating.
[00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:38.120]  They can't help it. They're still pushing it.
[00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:40.120]  That's right. Well, across the country
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:42.120]  you've seen this gay agenda being pushed,
[00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:44.120]  and specifically over the past five years
[00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:46.120]  it's ratcheted up way beyond, I think,
[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:48.120]  what anybody even thought possible.
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:50.120]  Years ago it started with this push
[00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:52.120]  for tolerance or something like this,
[00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:54.120]  and quite literally now you've got them saying,
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:56.120]  we're going to convert your kids.
[00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:58.120]  We're going to come for your kids.
[00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:00.120]  And these people are, like you said,
[00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:02.120]  predator, pedophile, vampire types.
[00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:04.120]  It's not about tolerance. It's not about love.
[00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:06.120]  It's not about anything like that.
[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:08.120]  It's about destroying innocence.
[00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:10.120]  That's right. It's about psychic vampirism.
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:12.120]  It's about literal Satanism, which is what these elites are.
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:14.120]  They're evil people, and they're using the energy
[00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:16.120]  of the young and maybe the most evil thing
[00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:18.120]  that's happening in the world
[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:20.120]  to create this empire that they're trying to create.
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:22.120]  And it's all out there.
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:24.120]  Just take a look at Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:26.120]  This is something that's mainstream.
[00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:28.120]  What's incredible about Jeffrey Epstein is
[00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:30.120]  here's a case where it couldn't have been more obvious.
[00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:32.120]  This is something that everybody knew.
[00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:34.120]  It was basically like an open secret for 20 or 30 years.
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:36.120]  Finally they caught him. They threw him in jail.
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:38.120]  The government kills him because maybe
[00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:40.120]  he knows too much or something,
[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:42.120]  and they turn it into a big punchline.
[00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:44.120]  They turn it into a joke, and they say,
[00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:46.120]  Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself.
[00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:48.120]  And they say that on Reddit and everywhere else,
[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:50.120]  and it turns into a big punchline for a joke.
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:52.120]  It's not a punchline. It's not a joke.
[00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:54.120]  It's real. Take a look at who was on the flight logs.
[00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:56.120]  Take a look at Kevin Spacey.
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:58.120]  Take a look at his girlfriend,
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:00.120]  Delaine Maxwell, and who she was connected to.
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:02.120]  All the different global governments
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:04.120]  and Hollywood and things like that.
[00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:06.120]  It's not a joke. It's not a punchline. It's not a meme.
[00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:08.120]  These are the people that are running the world right now.
[00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:10.120]  That's the evil. That's the level that they're on.
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:12.120]  And folks that sign on to defending this
[00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:14.120]  or sign on to censoring us,
[00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:16.120]  you've now signed on to all this evil.
[00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:18.120]  The human animal cloning out in the open, all of it.
[00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:20.120]  You can find us at Banned.Video,
[00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:22.120]  but that URL is banned on Twitter and Facebook.
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:24.120]  Banned.Video. You can't share that URL.
[00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:26.120]  But we have a URL that is
[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:28.120]  FreeWorldNews.tv. It's on screen.
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:30.120]  FreeWorldNews.tv.
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:32.120]  FreeWorldNews.tv.
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:34.120]  And that has all the same URLs,
[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:36.120]  all the same videos, all the same links.
[00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:38.120]  He has a page, Nick Fuentes does, at Banned.Video
[00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:40.120]  or FreeWorldNews.tv.
[00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:42.120]  When they ban FreeWorldNews.tv, we'll come up with a new URL
[00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:44.120]  that does the same indexing system.
[00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:46.120]  You can find me weekdays 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:48.120]  and the other great shows, again, that we host
[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:50.120]  out of the Infowars News Center. I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:52.120]  Nick, you definitely are very
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:54.120]  embattled, as much as I am, maybe even
[00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:56.120]  more. And
[00:49:56.120 --> 00:49:58.120]  even if I disagree with you politically, which I
[00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:00.120]  don't, 99% of things,
[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:04.120]  if you were a terrible guy, I would support you because you're
[00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:06.120]  a symbol of free speech now, just like I am,
[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:08.120]  just like Trump is. And so people need to
[00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:10.120]  hold you up. It's like a Roman standard in a war.
[00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:12.120]  They want to get that standard. Or King of the Hill, they want to
[00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:14.120]  capture the flag. So you're a symbol of
[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:16.120]  free speech and liberty and
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:18.120]  pro-free speech and nationalism
[00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:20.120]  and a real stalwart.
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:22.120]  And so tell folks how they can support you, how they can
[00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:24.120]  follow you. You can find my show at
[00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:26.120]  AmericaFirst.live and that's Monday through
[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:28.120]  Friday at 8 o'clock central time and
[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:30.120]  also on NicholasJFuentes.com.
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:32.120]  But thanks so much for meeting me out here for
[00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:34.120]  breakfast. And likewise, you've become a symbol
[00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:36.120]  for freedom in the world and I think we're
[00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:38.120]  going to take it back in the next 5 to 10 years.
[00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:40.120]  That's right, they want to intimidate us. They want to take these
[00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:42.120]  icons of liberty and
[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:44.120]  destroy them and make it their symbol to
[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:46.120]  make everybody ashamed of freedom. But we can take the symbols
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:48.120]  back and celebrate those symbols.
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:50.120]  And so I personally am ready to go to prison or
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:52.120]  die because I believe
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:54.120]  that we're going to win this. And I know spiritually
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:56.120]  it's my job to fight this. Even in my lifetime, I don't see
[00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:58.120]  victory. But instead, we have a chance to see it very, very
[00:50:58.120 --> 00:51:00.120]  soon actually if good
[00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:02.120]  just rallies. And that's why evil is so desperate because
[00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:04.120]  it knows it's losing. And just to see people on
[00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:06.120]  Twitter and Instagram and Facebook
[00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:08.120]  defending me, defending
[00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:10.120]  Nick and rallying and using our names
[00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:12.120]  as an example saying, I don't buy your fraud.
[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:14.120]  That's something that really, really scares
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:16.120]  the system. And they're meeting in secret right
[00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:18.120]  now in Idaho, the big tech lords discussing
[00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:20.120]  how to try to silence us because if they
[00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:22.120]  can silence us, they're going to silence you.
[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:24.120]  So I thank you all for your activism and I love
[00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:26.120]  you no matter what color you are, no matter where you live.
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:28.120]  If you love freedom and you love justice,
[00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:30.120]  we are brothers and sisters together. I really appreciate
[00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:32.120]  you. Nick, thanks so much. Thank you.
[00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:34.120]  Thank you.
[00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:38.120]  I'm at war with tyranny,
[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:40.120]  but it doesn't mean that I have all the answers.
[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:42.120]  It doesn't mean that I figured out every
[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:44.120]  way to defeat them. But I know this.
[00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:46.120]  If we reduce our signature,
[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:48.120]  if we take the cell phones
[00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:50.120]  that have all these great attributes and all these great services,
[00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:52.120]  but also track, trace
[00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:54.120]  and spy on us. And if we lock
[00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:56.120]  them up in a little Faraday cage,
[00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:58.120]  like the little devils they are,
[00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:00.120]  they can't track us. They can't
[00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:02.120]  trace us. They can't use that data
[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:04.120]  against us for contact tracers,
[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:06.120]  the U.N., Joe Biden's
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:08.120]  people coming to your doors,
[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:10.120]  but also hackers and regular criminals.
[00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:12.120]  So what I do, and I've got a
[00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:14.120]  black one. I've got a red one. I also have it in blue.
[00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:16.120]  I put my little devilish
[00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:18.120]  cell phone in it. And it also reminds
[00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:20.120]  me of how powerful the phone is
[00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:22.120]  and how it's surveilling me. And it makes me
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:24.120]  reduce my phone time
[00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:26.120]  and spend more time with my family.
[00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:28.120]  So when I'm driving in a car
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:30.120]  or when I'm going to church
[00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:32.120]  or when I'm at the grocery store or when I'm not
[00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:34.120]  going to use this thing or I go to bed at night,
[00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:36.120]  I remind myself it's a
[00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:38.120]  2X sword and I put it right inside
[00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:40.120]  this container. Now, we've been
[00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:42.120]  sold out of these for months
[00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:44.120]  because of the supply chain breakdowns with the
[00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:46.120]  fake COVID lockdowns. But finally,
[00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:48.120]  we got in some big
[00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:50.120]  shipments of these babies.
[00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:52.120]  And so I want to encourage you to take action and get
[00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:54.120]  off the fence and get them. Normally, we sell
[00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:56.120]  them at $19.95, which is
[00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:58.120]  massively discounted from $29.95
[00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:00.120]  to this exact same high
[00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:02.120]  quality Faraday cage sells all
[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:04.120]  day long. We're selling it for the first time
[00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:06.120]  50% off
[00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:08.120]  $14.95 at
[00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:10.120]  info.warstore.com in four colors, black,
[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:12.120]  red, blue, and green. We've got
[00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:14.120]  a bunch of black, a bunch of red, a bunch of blue.
[00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:16.120]  The green is almost sold out. They're
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:18.120]  $14.95. They're a great gift
[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:20.120]  for friends and family.
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:22.120]  They're a great conversation piece. They're
[00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:24.120]  all available, massively discounted
[00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:26.120]  at info.warstore.com.
[00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:28.120]  Let's start taking back control of our
[00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:30.120]  lives by becoming conscious.
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:32.120]  Let's put these little devilish spy systems
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:34.120]  in a cage, except when we
[00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:36.120]  decide to use them.
[00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:38.120]  I never had a marketing plan for
[00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:40.120]  Infowars. I went out and found the best
[00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:42.120]  products I could find from the research
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:44.120]  to funder operation. I wanted you to get
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:46.120]  products that empowered you, that you loved,
[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:48.120]  so you'd want to come back and buy more. I
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:50.120]  treat you like I want to be treated. It's very, very
[00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:52.120]  simple. It's instinctive. It's spiritual.
[00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:54.120]  It's what I do. And that said, our
[00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:56.120]  iodine products have become our best sellers.
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:58.120]  And X2 right now is discounted because
[00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:00.120]  listeners and viewers are
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:02.120]  habituated to only buy
[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:04.120]  it when it's on sale. And so I'm
[00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:06.120]  going to catch 22. When I don't have it on sale,
[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:08.120]  I don't sell it. But we're selling out
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:10.120]  of all our other products because of supply chain
[00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:12.120]  breakdowns. And so I'm going to catch 22.
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:14.120]  I need to sell products at full price, but I can't.
[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:16.120]  I got to sell them at discount. And
[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:18.120]  so it's discounted 40% off
[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:20.120]  for the dropper bottle, 60% off
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:22.120]  for the spray bottle, even though it's about to sell
[00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:24.120]  out. It won't be available for months.
[00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:26.120]  So get it. X2 is selling
[00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:28.120]  out at InfoWorksStore.com
[00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:30.120]  for 40 and 60% off with
[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:32.120]  double Patreon points and free shipping. Because
[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:34.120]  why? That's when you buy it. We need
[00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:36.120]  your funds or we'll be off air. It's an amazing product.
[00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:56.120]  And
[00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:58.120]  it is Saturday, July 10th.
[00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:00.120]  The year is 2021 and
[00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:02.120]  I have a fellow Austinite formerly from
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:04.120]  New York, Michael Malice here with his
[00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:06.120]  amazing crew and his lovely girlfriend
[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:08.120]  had a chance to have dinner with him last night.
[00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:10.120]  That was great. And here he is in
[00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:12.120]  studio with us, ladies
[00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:14.120]  and gentlemen. Wow.
[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:16.120]  So much to talk about that hour
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:18.120]  and 15 minutes went by so quick yesterday.
[00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:20.120]  You wanted it. I wanted it. And first
[00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:22.120]  it's great to have you back. Thank you, sir.
[00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:24.120]  It seems like minutes ago we were here
[00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:26.120]  getting into growing
[00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:28.120]  up in the Soviet Union,
[00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:30.120]  coming here, the Russian
[00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:32.120]  perspective on
[00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:34.120]  what's happening in America. Yeah.
[00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:36.120]  One thing that I love
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:38.120]  to do is when you go on Twitter and
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:40.120]  social media and see some of the tactics
[00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:42.120]  that the corporate press or you
[00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:44.120]  would call the globalists I guess use like
[00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:46.120]  let's use an example is Greta Thunberg, right?
[00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:48.120]  The idea that any of us are
[00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:50.120]  whatever your opinions are in climate change,
[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:52.120]  the idea that you're going to take the word
[00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:54.120]  of some high school
[00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:56.120]  dropout who has opinions on the weather
[00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:58.120]  is something that I think most people
[00:55:58.120 --> 00:56:00.120]  in other contexts would regard
[00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:02.120]  as nonsensical. But the other
[00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:04.120]  at the same time, we would all say, look, if you've
[00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:06.120]  got a kid who has political opinions,
[00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:08.120]  you're not going to go up to this kid and shout
[00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:10.120]  them down and call them horrible names. It's a kid.
[00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:12.120]  You kind of feel nice. So
[00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:14.120]  they leverage children in a way
[00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:16.120]  that kind of is similar to Hamas, but
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:18.120]  at least Hamas expects you to do something
[00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:20.120]  about it. You see it with Greta Thunberg.
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:22.120]  You see it with David Hogg and some of these
[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:24.120]  other kids that came out of the Florida
[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:26.120]  shooting. And, you know,
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:28.120]  what they do is they take
[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:30.120]  these puppets. You and I remember
[00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:32.120]  I'm sure very well during the
[00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:34.120]  Iraq war, they had Cindy Sheehan.
[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:36.120]  Cindy Sheehan was a mom
[00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:38.120]  whose son died in the Iraq war.
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:40.120]  Horrible tragedy. This is something I would wish on
[00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:42.120]  absolutely no one almost.
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:44.120]  And she was on every show for every five
[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:46.120]  minutes as if she's the only
[00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:48.120]  mom who lost a son, as if she's
[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:50.120]  the only person who has a perspective.
[00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:52.120]  But she's useful to them because
[00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:54.120]  she's in a position to say what they can
[00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:56.120]  pretend to be objective and they're not going
[00:56:56.120 --> 00:56:58.120]  to be able to say. Now she's
[00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:00.120]  a trivia question because she served
[00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:02.120]  her purpose. The same thing you see with
[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:04.120]  these kids. And I think the thing is when you come from
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:06.120]  a Russian background, you know, I did come here
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:08.120]  when I was two, but we were certainly raised in a
[00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:10.120]  Russian household, is you see these
[00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:12.120]  tactics that face value
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:14.120]  and what they are. And it's kind of
[00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:16.120]  surprising when I see Americans
[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:18.120]  feel the need to
[00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:20.120]  engage with the views of a
[00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:22.120]  child. And
[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:24.120]  she was named Time Magazine's Person of the Year,
[00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:26.120]  I'm sure you remember last year. It's like
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:28.120]  so some girl from
[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:30.120]  overseas has an opinion on climate change
[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:32.120]  and now we're supposed to care about this?
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:34.120]  It's a very bizarre
[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:36.120]  situation where if you haven't
[00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:38.120]  been raised in this kind of media
[00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:40.120]  context, you're going to look at it
[00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:42.120]  like you're looking at another culture
[00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:44.120]  and be like, what is wrong with these people
[00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:46.120]  that they got to the point
[00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:48.120]  where this is something that needs to be engaged with
[00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:50.120]  seriously at all? If you're going to make the argument
[00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:52.120]  which is not at all unreasonable, that
[00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:54.120]  when it comes to climate, you should listen to people
[00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:56.120]  who are educated, informed
[00:57:56.120 --> 00:57:58.120]  scientists, so on and so forth. I can wrap
[00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:00.120]  my head around that very easily. But
[00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:02.120]  some kid? The only reason why
[00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:04.120]  someone like that is going to be leveraged
[00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:06.120]  is because most
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:08.120]  of us have the decency
[00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:10.120]  not to argue back with a child.
[00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:12.120]  And that is what I think Americans
[00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:14.120]  don't appreciate about how
[00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:16.120]  malevolent their enemies are. They
[00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:18.120]  have no shame when it comes to doing
[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:20.120]  things such as exploiting children
[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:22.120]  to further their political purposes.
[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:24.120]  And we saw the opposite.
[00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:26.120]  Everyone listening to this show knows
[00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:28.120]  to be respectful to older
[00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:30.120]  people. You see someone who's older,
[00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:32.120]  you call them sir or ma'am.
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:34.120]  You assume that they're a good person.
[00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:36.120]  You hold the door for them. This is something that's
[00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:38.120]  one-on-one type stuff. At the same time
[00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:40.120]  COVID hits, now instead of
[00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:42.120]  they're not saying, oh, you want obese
[00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:44.120]  people to die, which the comorbidity
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:46.120]  with morbid obesity and COVID is
[00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:48.120]  very high. They specifically say,
[00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:50.120]  oh, you want grandma to die
[00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:52.120]  because they know for most of
[00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:54.120]  all of us, the idea that you're going
[00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:56.120]  to harm an innocent elderly woman
[00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:58.120]  is something so unconscionable
[00:58:58.120 --> 00:59:00.120]  that you want to recoil in the opposite direction.
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:02.120]  It's the same tactic that they used
[00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:04.120]  in 2016 unsuccessfully
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:06.120]  when they were calling Trump and Trump supporters
[00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:08.120]  racists because people don't want
[00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:10.120]  to be racist. They recoil from that same
[00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:12.120]  thing here. It's like no one wants to say I'm against
[00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:14.120]  the elderly. I hate the elderly. I want
[00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:16.120]  harm on them. So by using these
[00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:18.120]  techniques, it's a very effective
[00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:20.120]  means of controlling the population
[00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:22.120]  with their shields, their human
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:24.120]  shields. Yes. And
[00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:26.120]  this is something I think people really need
[00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:28.120]  to wake up and focus less on
[00:59:28.120 --> 00:59:30.120]  what they are saying than the tactics
[00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:32.120]  that they use to further
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:34.120]  their BS.
[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:36.120]  I want to expand on
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:38.120]  a Russian perspective with your parents
[00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:40.120]  and coming here
[00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:42.120]  and what taught you to see how kind of
[00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:44.120]  cut and dry and glaring it is, whereas Americans
[00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:46.120]  have been slow simmering in this.
[00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:48.120]  It's really gotten bad now, but
[00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:50.120]  they seem naive to the fact that they
[00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:52.120]  are actually living in the middle of such
[00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:54.120]  propaganda. I mean, I think more and more the mask
[00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:56.120]  is coming away. But let's first look at
[00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:58.120]  this. Obviously
[00:59:58.120 --> 01:00:00.120]  Black Lives Matter has been given billions of dollars by
[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:02.120]  corporate America and international corporations.
[01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:04.120]  Let me interrupt you. They're tripping over themselves
[01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:06.120]  to show how much they support this movement.
[01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:08.120]  It's not some conspiracy or anything.
[01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:10.120]  They're front and center. And if you don't have
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:12.120]  it, you're fired. And so isn't
[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:14.120]  that what you're talking about? That
[01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:16.120]  corporate media
[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:18.120]  and the corporations themselves
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:20.120]  are hiring all these black
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:22.120]  spokespersons for almost every product. And I'm
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:24.120]  great. Give black folks jobs in TV
[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:26.120]  and radio. They're wonderful. My point is when
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:28.120]  almost every ad is a black person
[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:30.120]  and defense contractors are using a black
[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:32.120]  face, they literally are saying, hey,
[01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:34.120]  we're black folks. Don't disagree with us.
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:36.120]  You're racist. It's very simple
[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:38.120]  psychology. And then I hear some of these big black
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:40.120]  podcasters going, it's a black planet.
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:42.120]  We've taken over. Everything's us in the media.
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:44.120]  You know, we're in control now. No,
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:46.120]  they're starving Africans to death
[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:48.120]  with the lockdown that's ongoing in Africa
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:50.120]  and other places like India.
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:52.120]  This is exploitive.
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:54.120]  These are corporations that run slave camps in
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:56.120]  China like Apple.
[01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:58.120]  But it's okay because Tim Cook gave 100 million
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:00.120]  dollars in Black Lives Matter. It's almost like a
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:02.120]  Catholic indulgence or something
[01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:04.120]  where you pay the pope to get your family out of
[01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:06.120]  hell or out of purgatory.
[01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:08.120]  And it's so transparent that I remember
[01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:10.120]  I was in a deli in New
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:12.120]  York and I was buying gum and
[01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:14.120]  Trident had a picture
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:16.120]  of just like a black girl on it on the pack of gum.
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:18.120]  And it's like, wait a minute, I'm supposed
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:20.120]  to be against racism and I'm supposed to care about
[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:22.120]  this, which is true. So I'm going to buy
[01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:24.120]  gum that has a picture of a black
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:26.120]  lady on it for no reason. It's a complete
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:28.120]  non sequitur. It's nonsensical. You just
[01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:30.120]  brought up something which I think is extremely
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:32.120]  crucial. One of the things you always talk
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:34.120]  about the globalists and what globalism means
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:36.120]  is this concept that by
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:38.120]  its nature, whether you ford or against it,
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:40.120]  that there's one size fits all, that the entire
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:42.120]  globe should basically be governed under the same
[01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:44.120]  set of rules. All groups
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:46.120]  must give up their culture to unify
[01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:48.120]  under this. Well, who writes the codes like
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:50.120]  these leftists go, I want a big computer
[01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:52.120]  like the Zeitgeist movement that a lot of
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:54.120]  the resources who programs it. But what
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:56.120]  was that country now? There was a country in Africa.
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:58.120]  I'm sure you know what you're referring to.
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:00.120]  I would love you to edify it where they were trying
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:02.120]  to lock them down. They're saying if
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:04.120]  we don't leave our houses and farm
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:06.120]  Nigeria, Nigeria, we're going
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:08.120]  to die. We don't have bank accounts.
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:10.120]  We are very, very poor.
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:12.120]  And if we don't go tend these crops, we're
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:14.120]  literally going to die. Starvation is
[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:16.120]  a much bigger threat to us
[01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:18.120]  than any kind of illness. That's right. Nigeria
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:20.120]  It's about 56% last time I
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:22.120]  saw of the household incomes on food.
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:24.120]  Most people have to grow food or they die. Yeah.
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:26.120]  So the thing is, even if you're going
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:28.120]  to assume the most benevolent
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:30.120]  motivations to people that they're like, OK,
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:32.120]  we're trying to fight COVID. We have
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:34.120]  good motivations. When you
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:36.120]  have this kind of perspective that does not
[01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:38.120]  take individual circumstances into
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:40.120]  account, that individual is thrown
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:42.120]  into the garbage can. And what that ends
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:44.120]  up meaning in real terms is Matt's
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:46.120]  death and destruction. But
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:48.120]  they will never care because
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:50.120]  if they admit guilt and shame,
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:52.120]  that means you're not going to trust them the second
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:54.120]  time. And there goes a lot
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:56.120]  of the basis of their power and authority.
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:58.120]  Exactly. I mean, they all get together
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:00.120]  in a PR room. They look at different PR pushes.
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:02.120]  You've got meeting right now this
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:04.120]  weekend, the last day up in
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:06.120]  Idaho, all the big head tech
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:08.120]  people. And they say, Oh, we're
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:10.120]  talking about woke and fighting racism.
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:12.120]  And it's all a bunch of white dudes
[01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:14.120]  deciding how to go out and camouflage themselves
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:16.120]  as woke when they run some of those ruthless
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:18.120]  corporations on the planet. I mean, it's just it's
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:20.120]  preposterous. But it's also
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:22.120]  the fact that people are trained
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:24.120]  since their kids in
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:26.120]  government schools and in entertainment
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:28.120]  media as well.
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:30.120]  How important these issues are. And I
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:32.120]  do think it's really important. I think
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:34.120]  it is even still to this day.
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:36.120]  The history of American racism is
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.120]  poorly understood because it's not taught
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:40.120]  honestly and historically. Well, let's teach
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:42.120]  it honestly. I would call you a historian. You've written
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:44.120]  books on history. You've gone to North Korea.
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:46.120]  You know your history. I've studied a lot of history.
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:48.120]  People don't get it. It's not like boring. You get addicted
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:50.120]  to it and all sorts connecting
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:52.120]  different views on history. But I
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:54.120]  was brought up by parents that were kind of middle of the
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:56.120]  road politically patriotic.
[01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:58.120]  But they were like, you know, slavery is bad. And we've
[01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:00.120]  been we've done bad things to people. So
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:02.120]  you need to not be guilty, but you need to be above
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:04.120]  things and be honorable and try to help
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:06.120]  everybody. And that's how my grandparents
[01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:08.120]  were. And I'm not going to get into whole stories about it or whatever.
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:10.120]  But I mean,
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:12.120]  my dad's mom would literally go deliver
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:14.120]  food to all black ladies in the
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:16.120]  town and take them to the hospital and stuff. And it wasn't
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:18.120]  some it wasn't
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:20.120]  some act to be a virtue signaler. This is
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:22.120]  what you did. She also helped some of the old old
[01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:24.120]  white women in the area. That's what you did in those communities.
[01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:26.120]  It was mainly black people. And they would like
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:28.120]  on Christmas and stuff, bring pies to the house, everything else
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:30.120]  because they knew, you know, all the things that had gone
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:32.120]  on. And my grandfather was the tax assessor
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:34.120]  to all the poor people that he didn't get a tax
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:36.120]  bill. So it was stuff like that. But
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:38.120]  sitting there watching that and then I get to
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:40.120]  hear how I'm a racist and I'm inherently
[01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:42.120]  bad when I was always brought
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:44.120]  up to literally be a good person that helps
[01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:46.120]  everybody that stands up for who the person
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:48.120]  is that Martin Luther King talked about people.
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:50.120]  Martin Luther King didn't invent judge somebody
[01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:52.120]  off the character and off their deeds and what they
[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:54.120]  stand for. We all know that we go to a restaurant
[01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:56.120]  that has good food. Don't care what color you are.
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:58.120]  You buy a car, not because the name, but
[01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:00.120]  because, you know, you've driven it. You like it.
[01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:02.120]  You wear clothes. At least I did because I like
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:04.120]  how they fit, not because of the name.
[01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:06.120]  But see, that's the difference between corporatism and individualism
[01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:08.120]  is it's
[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:10.120]  it's all BS
[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:12.120]  over reality is basically what I'm saying. And so
[01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:14.120]  what about the backlash to have not
[01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:16.120]  being, quote, tribalist or racist
[01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:18.120]  really wanting to empower everybody, but being told
[01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:20.120]  because I'm white, I'm bad. That's
[01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:22.120]  the elite camouflaging themselves
[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:24.120]  in wokeness, but also knowing it's
[01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:26.120]  going to create a white backlash and
[01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:28.120]  whites I've known that have not been racist are
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:30.120]  starting to become resentful of
[01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:32.120]  black people because the new world order is using
[01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:34.120]  black people as their cover. And black folks better
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:36.120]  figure that out because it's dangerous. Yeah,
[01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:38.120]  I am opposed to any
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:40.120]  of that. And one thing I was just talking about earlier
[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:42.120]  in terms of what happens is a lot of people
[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:44.120]  on the right have given up entire
[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:46.120]  areas of sorry, entire areas
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:48.120]  of culture to left wing. They're going to say
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:50.120]  there's an earpiece in your ear or something and you're sorry.
[01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:52.120]  I'm just saying there's the camera. That's all I know.
[01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:54.120]  I'm getting my talking points from the KGB.
[01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:56.120]  A lot of
[01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:58.120]  people on the right have seeded in entire
[01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:00.120]  schools of thought to leftism, especially
[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:02.120]  at a university level. Let me give you that's key.
[01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:04.120]  I'm going to shut up. We just act like they're
[01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:06.120]  God. Whatever lexicon or map they give
[01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:08.120]  us of the mind, we just follow that. No, create
[01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:10.120]  your own maps, folks. Go with common sense.
[01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:12.120]  You do not have to have
[01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:14.120]  any kind of political persuasion whatsoever
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:16.120]  to ask yourself, what would
[01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:18.120]  it have been like to be an African-American
[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:20.120]  person in New York in 1790?
[01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:22.120]  This is something that is of interest to anyone.
[01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:24.120]  Are they going to be treated the same? How bad are they
[01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:26.120]  going to be treated? However, because
[01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:28.120]  people tend have bought into
[01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:30.120]  the idea that gay history or
[01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:32.120]  feminist history or black history are
[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:34.120]  inherently a left wing or Democrat
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:36.120]  issue, they recoil.
[01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:38.120]  And then those people get to be the ones
[01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:40.120]  to write the history and they use the when in truth,
[01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:42.120]  it's no one's endorsing the institution of slavery.
[01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:44.120]  But it was incredible how many blacks
[01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:46.120]  had slaves and how there were free men and not
[01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:48.120]  and how most of Europeans that came here were
[01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:50.120]  indentured servant slaves themselves.
[01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:52.120]  No one knows that stuff. But here's
[01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:54.120]  something that's even more recent. Like you could
[01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:56.120]  they use a technique called factual, not truthful.
[01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:58.120]  Let's suppose you and I were both I don't know
[01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:00.120]  whatever huge income tax
[01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:02.120]  sheets and someone keeps talking about Alex Jones
[01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:04.120]  Jones, Alex Jones, Alex Jones, the
[01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:06.120]  it was an income tax sheet. The implication is that
[01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:08.120]  I'm innocent. I'm not innocent, but you're
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:10.120]  focusing Alex Jones. And when you see here is
[01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:12.120]  there's a lot of focus on the South and
[01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:14.120]  Southern racism, both during the slavery period
[01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:16.120]  and the reconstruction. But they pretend
[01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:18.120]  that the North were these, you know,
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:20.120]  kind of in law. I mean, I love
[01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:22.120]  northerners, but I never heard people call black
[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:24.120]  people in words till I went up north.
[01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:26.120]  And I thought, is this a test to see if I'm racist?
[01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:28.120]  I never heard the N word till I got around northerners
[01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:30.120]  and it's a racist stuff. But it's also
[01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:32.120]  if you go back and so what is that
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:34.120]  then? What is what?
[01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:36.120]  Have you experienced in the North a lot of race type
[01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:38.120]  stuff? No, I mean, but my point
[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:40.120]  is back in which I'm talking about history.
[01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:42.120]  I'm saying I never even heard the N word till I was in
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:44.120]  like New York and stuff. Well, I mean, I'm
[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:46.120]  from Brooklyn. This is not something that
[01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:48.120]  is a thing. You know what I mean?
[01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:50.120]  But if you look at let's back to your thoughts, I'm gonna show
[01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:52.120]  you. That's a lie. If you look at back
[01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:54.120]  in the day, if you look
[01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:56.120]  at like the Harlem Renaissance, which was this great period
[01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:58.120]  in the 1920s where there was this kind of
[01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:00.120]  revolution in terms of black artistry.
[01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:02.120]  Langston Hughes was one of the great American poets
[01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:04.120]  of all time. He would talk about he was a student
[01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:06.120]  at Columbia, Columbia, and he couldn't
[01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:08.120]  get a job. So but
[01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:10.120]  this is the kind of stuff that because people
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:12.120]  on the right refuse to look
[01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:14.120]  at American history and let their opponents
[01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:16.120]  write for them, then they're
[01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:18.120]  reacting to a caricature
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:20.120]  of what ended up really happening.
[01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:22.120]  And this is a huge disservice. And I
[01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:24.120]  would encourage anyone because I am positive
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:26.120]  a lot of your viewers are huge history buffs.
[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:28.120]  Stop taking the New York Times
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:30.120]  version of history at face value.
[01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:32.120]  Well, give us a few gems then of
[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:34.120]  alternate history versus leftist
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:36.120]  bizarro history.
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:38.120]  Well, I mean, this is one great example. The claim
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:40.120]  that the South was uniquely racist
[01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:42.120]  in American culture. Let's look at the abolition period.
[01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:44.120]  One of my great heroes, William Lloyd Garrison,
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:46.120]  I have a signed autograph hanging
[01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:48.120]  above my desk in my office. He was
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:50.120]  advocating for abolition today
[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:52.120]  and full rights for black Americans
[01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:54.120]  today. He was almost lynched
[01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:56.120]  in Boston. You could still see
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:58.120]  the place where that they almost
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:00.120]  got him. This is in the 1840s.
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:02.120]  This was 1850s, I believe. But
[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:04.120]  this is the kind of thing that is kind of swept
[01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:06.120]  under the rug because it doesn't fit the
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:08.120]  narrative that the north of the good guys and
[01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:10.120]  the south of bad guys, they were both
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:12.120]  good guy, bad guys in different
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:14.120]  ways. If you want to honestly
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:16.120]  grapple with the history of American
[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:18.120]  racism, which they do not
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:20.120]  because their version suits their purpose.
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:22.120]  If you want to honestly look at the history,
[01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:24.120]  you have to look at the entire culture.
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:26.120]  Where was it worse? Where was it bad?
[01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:28.120]  Illinois, for example, had something called
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:30.120]  sundown towns. What sundown towns
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:32.120]  were was you could not be
[01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:34.120]  there as a black person when the
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:36.120]  sun went down or they would forcibly
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:38.120]  kick you out of that town. That's horrible.
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:40.120]  But we're taught Illinois,
[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:42.120]  Abe Lincoln's from there. They're the good guys
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:44.120]  and the south of the bad guys.
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:46.120]  Since this doesn't fit that cookie cutter story,
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:48.120]  this is the kind of thing that none of us
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:50.120]  know. But now in the 2021, we're taught
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:52.120]  none of us can be out at sundown with the lockdowns.
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:54.120]  They're just begging us all slaves.
[01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:56.120]  Sunrise to sunset. Yeah, we have to be
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:58.120]  trapped in our homes. This is just one of
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:00.120]  the examples where I think it
[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:02.120]  is. There's a lack.
[01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:04.120]  Maybe it's part of the psychology. I don't know.
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:06.120]  And I'm not trying to offend people.
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:08.120]  Just take a step back and don't emotional react to this.
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:10.120]  There's a lack in some sense of
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:12.120]  intellectual curiosity. A lot of a lot
[01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:14.120]  of among a lot of people
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:16.120]  on the right. And it's doing
[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:18.120]  a huge disservice because the 16 19
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:20.120]  project is another great example of New York Times.
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:22.120]  When you let your ideological foes
[01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:24.120]  rewrite history and your only reaction
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:26.120]  is, well, screw you. I'm going to do the opposite.
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:28.120]  You're playing on their terms.
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:30.120]  And you notice the left got so upset when
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:32.120]  Trump put out that report by a bunch of
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:34.120]  professors, a lot of black professors
[01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:36.120]  about being proud of America and how it was a
[01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:38.120]  trailblazer in the world. Now it helped other countries
[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:40.120]  stop the bad things they were doing.
[01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:42.120]  They got so upset. Look, it's plagiarized
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:44.120]  by different professors. But then
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:46.120]  there were professors whose names were
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:48.120]  on it who contributed.
[01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:50.120]  Again, they tried to call it plagiarized because
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:52.120]  the people's names on it had contributed
[01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:54.120]  from other reports. That's not plagiarized
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:56.120]  when it's their work put in the report.
[01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:58.120]  Yeah, there's just so much misinformation
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:00.120]  or it's not even misinformation.
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:02.120]  It's selective
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:04.120]  information designed to further a narrative.
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:06.120]  But that's at the expense of the
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:08.120]  whole picture. So we're hearing things out of
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:10.120]  two sides of the mouth in terms of
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:12.120]  corporate media. You hear that the history
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:14.120]  of American racism is complex
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:16.120]  nuance, something that bears a lot of discussion.
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:18.120]  True. But at the same time
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:20.120]  what they present the narrative is not complex
[01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:22.120]  at all. It's straightforward. These are the bad
[01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:24.120]  guys. These are the good guys. Which one are you going to
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:26.120]  be? Well, you know, it's not a hard choice
[01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:28.120]  between bad and good. Well, that's right.
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:30.120]  They dumbed down the information
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:32.120]  and so the medium is
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:34.120]  the message. Yeah. And this does an
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:36.120]  enormous disservice to racial
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:38.120]  relationships in America. It does enormous
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:40.120]  disservice to people who have a proud history
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:42.120]  to tell them that you should regard yourself
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:44.120]  as a victim. Whereas a lot of times the
[01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:46.120]  people that they came from were the ones who are
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:48.120]  heroic and the ones we should all admire.
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:50.120]  Well, exactly. And let's expand on that.
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:52.120]  We look
[01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:54.120]  at this one size
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:56.120]  fits all thing for America. But if you
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:58.120]  look at how slavery is going on, at least 10 countries
[01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:00.120]  right now. Is that right? Oh, absolutely.
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:02.120]  There's still slavery in some of the Middle Eastern countries
[01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:04.120]  or slavery in Africa going on. Yeah.
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:06.120]  And all that's happening
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:08.120]  and you've got slavery. I call it slavery in China
[01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:10.120]  under communism. Of course that's slavery.
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:12.120]  Yes. So my issue is
[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:14.120]  talking about America's issues
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:16.120]  becomes a distraction from
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:18.120]  everything else. And where was America
[01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:20.120]  245 years ago when it was born?
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:22.120]  They almost put banning slavery in the first
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:24.120]  Constitution, but they couldn't get it passed
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:26.120]  in the Bill of Rights, so they couldn't get it done. The point
[01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:28.120]  is there were people having those debates now, but it doesn't
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:30.120]  matter if my grandfather wasn't
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:32.120]  a criminal, but if he was a murderer,
[01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:34.120]  I don't owe you anything. Is my grandfather
[01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:36.120]  killed your daddy with an ax or
[01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:38.120]  you know, did whatever
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:40.120]  or my great great granddaddy was a child molester
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:42.120]  hypothetically. I'm not to blame this
[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:44.120]  this authoritarian idea
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:46.120]  of sins of the forefathers
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:48.120]  is so bizarre. I mean, who even knows
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:50.120]  what their great great great great grandfather did?
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:52.120]  How are they going to say more than
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:54.120]  half of the Europeans came here after the Civil
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:56.120]  War? Only what? Two percent
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:58.120]  of people in the US had slaves during
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:00.120]  the Civil War before it. So the idea
[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:02.120]  that we all have this sin
[01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:04.120]  when almost no white people here
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:06.120]  have any connection to it is just
[01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:08.120]  preposterous. Well, also the idea again
[01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:10.120]  there's something no historians can disagree with. Lincoln
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:12.120]  said repeatedly and explicitly
[01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:14.120]  if I could unify the union
[01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:16.120]  without freeing one black slave, I'd do it. Yeah.
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:18.120]  So and the claim that anyone
[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:20.120]  in 1860 with exceptions like
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:22.120]  William Lloyd Garrison and other
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:24.120]  who at the time complete fringe figures
[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:26.120]  did not have an element of racism
[01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:28.120]  to it is completely untrue
[01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:30.120]  and that's something that I think people who
[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:32.120]  study history all agree on. And it's something
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:34.120]  that bears this. Sure. And what about how
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:36.120]  it was Christians that led
[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:38.120]  the fight? England really banned slavery
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:40.120]  in most of the world. England went to war with dozens
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:42.120]  of countries. Hundreds of thousands died
[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:44.120]  in some cases per war to
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:46.120]  end slavery. And that was Christians that
[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:48.120]  was kind of like Cromwell Part Two taking
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:50.120]  over and demanding a gun pointed in.
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:52.120]  So how if white people ended slavery
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:54.120]  in most areas of the world, how are we to blame? That's all I'm saying.
[01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:56.120]  And the other thing that's swept in because if sins
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:58.120]  are passed on, aren't good deeds passed on?
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:00.120]  Actually, I don't think they really are.
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:02.120]  But the other thing that's swept on the rug is you have the
[01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:04.120]  story of the Civil War, which is kind of
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:06.120]  painted in a very simplistic terms as the victory
[01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:08.120]  of good over evil. But then you talk about
[01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:10.120]  reconstruction where all these supposed good guys
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:12.120]  did not give a crap about the formerly
[01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:14.120]  free slaves, that they were being completely
[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:16.120]  exploited and terrorized
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:18.120]  by the Southern governments.
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:20.120]  But since you have the narrative
[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:22.120]  of now the North abandoned them and didn't care
[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:24.120]  and they never cared about them to begin
[01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:26.120]  with, that somehow that doesn't fit into that
[01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:28.120]  cookie cutter Disney version. And that's
[01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:30.120]  something that also is ignored.
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:32.120]  I think that is enormous. Well, I'll tell you what's accurate.
[01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:34.120]  I mean, it's stylized like a play. But
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:36.120]  Martin Scorsese's Gangs of
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:38.120]  New York from reading history, that's
[01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:40.120]  pretty accurate. I mean, every group hated
[01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:42.120]  every other group. So I'm saying it's very tribal. Oh,
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:44.120]  oh, enormously so, especially. And
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:46.120]  that's one of the other beauties of having free markets
[01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:48.120]  when people are wealthier, they have an
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:50.120]  opportunity to be kinder,
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:52.120]  more benevolent. It's if if I have to
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:54.120]  choose between you and me and my family when it
[01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:56.120]  comes to food. Sorry, Alex, I like you. It's not
[01:14:56.120 --> 01:14:58.120]  going to be a choice. But if we both have enough
[01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:00.120]  food in our plate, hell, take as much
[01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:02.120]  as you want. Let's expand. There are a lot of studies
[01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:04.120]  that this is common sense that show
[01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:06.120]  private jets, luxury hotels,
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:08.120]  better doctors. The truth is that all
[01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:10.120]  trickles down. The people actually get all those services.
[01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:12.120]  Look how many better services there are than
[01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:14.120]  were 10 years ago, 100 years ago. I mean,
[01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:16.120]  you cannot deny that wealth
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:18.120]  in a general spectrum creates more
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:20.120]  wealth. Well, it's also just basic
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:22.120]  humanity. If you go back 100 years ago,
[01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:24.120]  we didn't have air conditioning. People
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:26.120]  are sleeping on their roofs. They're sleeping in public
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:28.120]  parks. And now this is something that we all take
[01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:30.120]  for given. When my dad would go
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:32.120]  visit his grandparents in the town next to them, he
[01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:34.120]  lived in the country. What state was this in? This is
[01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:36.120]  Texas. Okay. This is women here since
[01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:38.120]  that side of the family since the 1820s on both sides.
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:40.120]  Okay. We get into lineage and stuff, which I don't
[01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:42.120]  take credit for that. But I'm like founders of Texas
[01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:44.120]  on both sides. Colonel Travis
[01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:46.120]  like nobody's even related to those people. But I am
[01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:48.120]  the thing is, is that they would
[01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:50.120]  my dad would go sleep on his grandfather's roof
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:52.120]  in Texas. That's what you did for air conditioning.
[01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:54.120]  Yeah. And that also going to lead to crime
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:56.120]  and mugging because you're asleep and you're outside and
[01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:58.120]  all sorts of assaults. But this
[01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:00.120]  is something we all take for granted that now even the
[01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:02.120]  poorest people have access to air conditioning
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:04.120]  and having kind of that. Can you imagine how miserable
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:06.120]  it is to be 24 seven and never to have
[01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:08.120]  like cool and you have access to running water or
[01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:10.120]  shower. So we take for
[01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:12.120]  granted how much better things have gotten
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:14.120]  for even the poorest of the poor in America.
[01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:16.120]  And when you do have that wealth,
[01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:18.120]  it's much easier to be
[01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:20.120]  helpful and more benevolent to others because
[01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:22.120]  doesn't cost you anything. Well, when I read
[01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:24.120]  the WikiLeaks, you can pull these up.
[01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:26.120]  Hillary's talking to
[01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:28.120]  I want to say it's a Columbia psychology
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:30.120]  professor, but she
[01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:32.120]  says, what do we do? And he said, we accelerate
[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:34.120]  culture war. It's all we can do is divide
[01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:36.120]  them. So it's right there. They're dividing and
[01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:38.120]  conquering. So how do you counter something that
[01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:40.120]  cynical? Well, first of all,
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:42.120]  you have to acknowledge it for what it is that
[01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:44.120]  these people have no shame and they have no
[01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:46.120]  compunctions about doing whatever is necessary to
[01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:48.120]  maintain their hold on power.
[01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:50.120]  2020 is a great example. Let's
[01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:52.120]  suppose for the sake of argument, and this is not
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:54.120]  a hard argument to make, you needed to destroy
[01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:56.120]  all these businesses in order to
[01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:58.120]  otherwise billions of people
[01:16:58.120 --> 01:17:00.120]  are going to die. Fine. You would think
[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:02.120]  when it was all said and done, you'd be like,
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:04.120]  man, this was terrible that all these
[01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:06.120]  businesses were destroyed. What about
[01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:08.120]  horrible price we paid for this? There's
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:10.120]  none of that. There's no hand wringing about
[01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:12.120]  what have we done? What were the costs? It was
[01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:14.120]  like we did what had to be done. If you're out of
[01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:16.120]  business, too bad. And
[01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:18.120]  then you see the motivation really isn't
[01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:20.120]  helping people so much as maintaining power
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:22.120]  control and getting their agenda.
[01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:24.120]  When I did your show
[01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:26.120]  that just premiered a few days ago,
[01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:28.120]  it was great. You rapid-fired
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:30.120]  questions. You were very prepared. I'm not.
[01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:32.120]  I mean, I actually have hundreds of questions I can ask.
[01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:34.120]  You're not prepared. You've got phone books in front of you.
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:36.120]  This is from the show yesterday, but seriously,
[01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:38.120]  I agree with you
[01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:40.120]  that we're winning and that there's an awakening
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:42.120]  happening and these power grabs are a sign of desperation.
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:44.120]  But let's elaborate
[01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:46.120]  on that.
[01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:48.120]  Sure. I think that
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:50.120]  if you had your druthers,
[01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:52.120]  if you can tell someone, hey,
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:54.120]  if you do this,
[01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:56.120]  you do what I want, you just persuade them,
[01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:58.120]  that's going to be cheap. Doesn't take me much
[01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:00.120]  expense. I just tell you two sentences
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:02.120]  and I get what I want. If I have
[01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:04.120]  to persuade you, if I have
[01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:06.120]  to force you, that is more expensive
[01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:08.120]  in terms of my emotions, more expensive
[01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:10.120]  in terms of my time. And at a certain point,
[01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:12.120]  you, the target, are going to resent
[01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:14.120]  it because instead of doing what I believe
[01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:16.120]  I had been persuaded to do,
[01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:18.120]  now I'm being strong armed into it.
[01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:20.120]  And it is, you know, like if someone has a
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:22.120]  dog that's disobedient, at a certain point,
[01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:24.120]  you're like, I love this dog. I can't deal with it anymore
[01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:26.120]  because it's just driving me crazy.
[01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:28.120]  That quiet defiance,
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:30.120]  which all of us are in a position
[01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:32.120]  to impose and to make it
[01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:34.120]  expensive for them, that I
[01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:36.120]  think drives them crazy because it also
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:38.120]  takes away their veneer of what Thomas
[01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:40.120]  Sowell called the vision of the anointed.
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:42.120]  That's a great book.
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:44.120]  It's a superb book. I read that book like
[01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:46.120]  25 years ago. Yeah, he talks
[01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:48.120]  to the idea, which especially
[01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:50.120]  overeducated urban elites,
[01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:52.120]  that they genuinely feel, and they were taught
[01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:54.120]  this. They think they're saviors. They were taught
[01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:56.120]  this since the 1890s. Woodrow
[01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:58.120]  Wilson's vision was something
[01:18:58.120 --> 01:19:00.120]  called the social gospel. And what
[01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:02.120]  that meant, it's supposedly Christian, but I'm
[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:04.120]  not a Christian. It seems to be the opposite. But it's more
[01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:06.120]  white man's burden.
[01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:08.120]  But it's not, yeah.
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:10.120]  Yeah, yeah. My point is, the
[01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:12.120]  idea, which is I think in terms of
[01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:14.120]  regular Christianity is downright satanic. Instead
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:16.120]  of an individual having a soul, a nation
[01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:18.120]  has a soul. And you have to save
[01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:20.120]  that nation from
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:22.120]  falling into sin. Well, if your entire
[01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:24.120]  nation has a soul, what is
[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:26.120]  going to be outside your dominion? Nothing.
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:28.120]  You're going to be involved in the boardroom.
[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:30.120]  That is totally collectivist. It's
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:32.120]  totally collectivist. It's totally not Christian.
[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:34.120]  And it's totally deranged. But
[01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:36.120]  you see that in this day where
[01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:38.120]  nobody feels
[01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:40.120]  empowered to impose their view
[01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:42.120]  on those who are thinking or acting
[01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:44.120]  correctly. Exactly. Like you said, it's whatever the Democrats
[01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:46.120]  say, we then
[01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:48.120]  debate that instead of creating,
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:50.120]  earlier you were saying, the Democrats
[01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:52.120]  history-wise, the Left,
[01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:54.120]  they're the ones that are creating the main
[01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:56.120]  religious
[01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:58.120]  system we're supposed to follow. Yeah, but Teddy Roosevelt
[01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:00.120]  was part of this as well. No, you're right.
[01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:02.120]  This is what I wanted to ask you. In your
[01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:04.120]  green room, you have... You want to get into how Republicans have been
[01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:06.120]  co-opted. Yeah, yeah. Let's talk, we're not co-opted.
[01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:08.120]  One of the villains of my book that you write
[01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:10.120]  was William F. Buckley, who I think is really
[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:12.120]  the great villain of the American right of the 20th century.
[01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:14.120]  You have a poster of him from,
[01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:16.120]  I don't know if I'm telling tales out of school. No, no,
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:18.120]  grab it. We're bringing it in here. Will somebody grab that
[01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:20.120]  off the wall in the green room, please? It was the 1965 mayoral
[01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:22.120]  campaign, which was kind of a stunt. When
[01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:24.120]  Buckley was asked, what would you do if you won, he said
[01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:26.120]  ask for a recount. So he was kind of clever
[01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:28.120]  in his own way. I thought he was a very
[01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:30.120]  nefarious influence on the Right
[01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:32.120]  because he regarded himself as kind of that gatekeeper
[01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:34.120]  and anyone to... Yeah, he was definitely
[01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:36.120]  CIA. Okay, so yeah, that's true.
[01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:38.120]  Can you talk about that?
[01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:40.120]  Let me tell you how this
[01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:42.120]  stuff happens around here. Yeah, there it is.
[01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:44.120]  About half the things on the walls
[01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:46.120]  were
[01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:48.120]  mailed to us. Okay.
[01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:50.120]  And this was mailed to me. Okay.
[01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:52.120]  And I thought it was interesting and I stuck it up.
[01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:54.120]  It is interesting. It's most certainly...
[01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:56.120]  And guys, go back in the hallway
[01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:58.120]  right there. There's a Bible
[01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:00.120]  verse a listener sent to. That's hanging up, which I
[01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:02.120]  do agree with. So just grab the Bible verse off the wall
[01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:04.120]  right there. Here, here, here, here. Let's keep talking.
[01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:06.120]  Yeah, well, I want to know why what that
[01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:08.120]  means to you and why it's hanging and so on and so
[01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:10.120]  forth.
[01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:12.120]  Like, do you
[01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:14.120]  are you a fan of Buckley? Do you think what do you think of
[01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:16.120]  National Review? No, I've made fun of him quite a bit.
[01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:18.120]  Okay, so what do you view is the
[01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:20.120]  Buckley? What is your
[01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:22.120]  evaluation of William F. Buckley and
[01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:24.120]  his influence on this? I endorse
[01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:26.120]  and a listener sent us this too.
[01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:28.120]  Okay. If my people,
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:30.120]  which are called by my name, shall humble themselves
[01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:32.120]  and pray and seek my face and turn
[01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:34.120]  from their wicked ways, then I will have
[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:36.120]  from heaven and will forgive their sin
[01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:38.120]  and will heal the land.
[01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:40.120]  Yeah, and so more than half the stuff
[01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:42.120]  hanging in this office was mailed to me. Okay.
[01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:44.120]  There's some really great stuff.
[01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:46.120]  Charlie Sheen
[01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:48.120]  mailed me a
[01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:50.120]  the jacket he wore in
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:52.120]  in...
[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:54.120]  What's the name of that movie? Red Dawn. Okay.
[01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:56.120]  So it's on the wall. Oh, okay. And almost
[01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:58.120]  in fact, more than 60.
[01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:00.120]  I mean, I'd say 60, 70% of stuff hanging on the walls
[01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:02.120]  has been given to us. That was given to me.
[01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:04.120]  I thought it was weird. It was sent to me.
[01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:06.120]  I think by somebody like in Maine or something
[01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:08.120]  and actually sent to me
[01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:10.120]  in a old
[01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:12.120]  tube. So I actually had it
[01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:14.120]  framed. They sent it to me because I just kind of
[01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:16.120]  like listeners to put the
[01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:18.120]  art on the walls around here. Sure.
[01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:20.120]  And so that's basically where that came from. But no, William
[01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:22.120]  F. Buckley was there from the Eastern
[01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:24.120]  establishment to try to
[01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:26.120]  corral conservatives and basically
[01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:28.120]  be the leader of the movement. The Democrats
[01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:30.120]  still fought him, didn't like him. They were battling
[01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:32.120]  over power. But clearly
[01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:34.120]  they admit the CIA was involved. And
[01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:36.120]  that's why you saw the entire cover of
[01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:38.120]  National Review when Trump
[01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:40.120]  was about to win the nomination saying we do
[01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:42.120]  not want Trump. Yeah, never. Against Trump
[01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:44.120]  was the headline. Yeah, absolutely. And so
[01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:46.120]  and so, I mean, it's a piece of history
[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:48.120]  and so I hung it up on the wall.
[01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:50.120]  But there's no cryptic secret meeting.
[01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:52.120]  This I endorse
[01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:54.120]  wholeheartedly. This is something
[01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:56.120]  this was meld us in the frame, by the way. Very
[01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:58.120]  nice gift. I forget. We've had this for
[01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:00.120]  over 10 years. So that's where the William
[01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:02.120]  F. Buckley thing comes from. But I think it's a very good question.
[01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:04.120]  But what do you think about like National
[01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:06.120]  Review just historically and today?
[01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:08.120]  Do you think that they had done more harm than good?
[01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:10.120]  Do you think they're just globalists? Like, what's
[01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:12.120]  your perspective on them?
[01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:14.120]  Undoubtedly, National Review
[01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:16.120]  has presided over the destruction of America.
[01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:18.120]  Oh, there's an answer. Okay. Yeah.
[01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:20.120]  Yeah. And I think it's just full of terrible
[01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:22.120]  people. And I think William F.
[01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:24.120]  Buckley was a fop. I think
[01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:26.120]  he was a fraudulent intellectual
[01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:28.120]  who would sit
[01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:30.120]  there and
[01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:33.679]  pontificate with fancy words.
[01:23:33.679 --> 01:23:36.980]  He'd come up with strong together that at the time didn't even have any meaning.
[01:23:36.980 --> 01:23:40.780]  And he would he would have equally fraudulent conversations with other
[01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:43.580]  leftist fops and then they would all you know,
[01:23:43.580 --> 01:23:46.679]  snootily decide that they were the ruling class.
[01:23:46.679 --> 01:23:48.380]  And so that's where I see William Buckley.
[01:23:48.380 --> 01:23:50.880]  Now you raised somebody who I thought was really good.
[01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:54.080]  He loved the showgirls, you know, he owned his family was wealthy.
[01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:55.179]  He was a business guy.
[01:23:55.179 --> 01:23:56.780]  He already owned a bunch of malls.
[01:23:56.780 --> 01:23:58.780]  And of course that was Barry Goldwater.
[01:23:58.780 --> 01:24:01.679]  Who really wanted to end wars and was against the Trilateral Commission and
[01:24:01.679 --> 01:24:03.780]  thought we shouldn't have a latest run on America.
[01:24:03.780 --> 01:24:08.780]  He was really a great a good guy that Reagan then copy but never delivered on.
[01:24:08.780 --> 01:24:12.679]  So if you want to know what Reagan came out of he came out of Barry Goldwater.
[01:24:12.679 --> 01:24:16.380]  And so I think Barry Goldwater was the real deal not perfect but but real and
[01:24:16.380 --> 01:24:20.380]  then I think the opposite of a Barry Goldwater is William F Buckley.
[01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:23.380]  So it was really funny because in 19 Barry Goldwater for
[01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:25.080]  people who are on the right who don't know him.
[01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:27.480]  It might be one of the most interesting character running ads
[01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:30.179]  where you're going to get nuked if you vote for Goldwater.
[01:24:30.179 --> 01:24:35.080]  Well, they came out with a can of Goldwater as part of the campaign and
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:39.679]  he drank it once and he said this tastes like piss but his campaign was really
[01:24:39.679 --> 01:24:42.179]  when Reagan put his stamp on the map.
[01:24:42.179 --> 01:24:43.980]  I'm going to be talking about this in an upcoming book.
[01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:45.380]  I would encourage everyone.
[01:24:45.380 --> 01:24:47.980]  Oh, so you're an expert on what else but well, I'm not I don't want to say expert
[01:24:47.980 --> 01:24:52.580]  yet, but the people spend some time on trying but somewhat crazy person keeps
[01:24:52.580 --> 01:24:57.280]  talking over me despite promising otherwise yesterday and in text and in writing.
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:24:58.580]  I didn't really you'd love yesterday.
[01:24:58.679 --> 01:24:59.580]  I did love yesterday.
[01:24:59.580 --> 01:24:59.880]  I'm here.
[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:01.480]  Ain't I all in a row more of yesterday?
[01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:03.380]  Okay, go ahead in it.
[01:25:03.380 --> 01:25:05.280]  I want everyone who is a patriot.
[01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:06.179]  Everyone is American.
[01:25:06.179 --> 01:25:07.080]  I'm not using the word Patriot.
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:11.880]  Ironically look up Reagan's speech from 1964 when he came out for Goldwater,
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:14.880]  even though Goldwater had no chance at that point of winning and it was like
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:16.780]  the biggest electoral landslide in history.
[01:25:16.980 --> 01:25:21.679]  His speech is called a time for choosing and there's this great paragraph in it,
[01:25:21.679 --> 01:25:25.480]  which resonates strongly with me and with many other people where he talks
[01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:28.880]  about how two friends from Cuba and one of them they had escaped to the
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:33.679]  States and sorry Cuban and American and the guy tells the Cuban, you know,
[01:25:33.679 --> 01:25:38.880]  you're so lucky you had America to escape to and the Cuban says yeah,
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:40.780]  but you guys have nowhere to go.
[01:25:40.780 --> 01:25:41.780]  I had America.
[01:25:41.780 --> 01:25:43.280]  There's no America for you.
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:48.580]  If things go bad here and Reagan had the line he goes this is the last
[01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:51.780]  hope on Earth if freedom dies here.
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:53.679]  There's nowhere else to go.
[01:25:53.780 --> 01:25:57.880]  And I think even though I'm an anarchist and have enormous I hate the
[01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:03.179]  government because I love this country and I think it's very useful for a lot
[01:26:03.179 --> 01:26:05.580]  of people and I'm positive you would agree with me.
[01:26:05.679 --> 01:26:10.179]  They will exploit the concept of patriotism because people love America
[01:26:10.179 --> 01:26:11.980]  correctly in order to further.
[01:26:11.980 --> 01:26:15.280]  So we better define what real patriotism is in a limited sense.
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:17.179]  We're not going to go to zero government overnight.
[01:26:17.179 --> 01:26:19.179]  The communists have their plan anarchists have theirs.
[01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:22.980]  I agree that with an upright moral people, you know, maybe a hundred years
[01:26:22.980 --> 01:26:25.780]  now there will be no government and no corporation acting like government.
[01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:30.480]  Right, but but but how do we get to that Nirvana and and what do we do in
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:30.980]  the interim?
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:34.280]  What is the little government we use to guard us from other systems?
[01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:38.780]  Well, I think the certain things the free speech principles when you
[01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:43.980]  have trying to put forth a narrative that is in contradiction to reality
[01:26:44.580 --> 01:26:46.780]  I or you or well, I can't say this about you.
[01:26:46.780 --> 01:26:50.179]  I'm not trying to make a joke if the New York Times has a tweet I can go
[01:26:50.179 --> 01:26:53.480]  on Twitter or anyone else can and say this is misinformation.
[01:26:53.679 --> 01:26:57.880]  Here's the receipts to the contrary on these sites your you have equal
[01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:00.380]  footing with these giant Goliath with these Goliaths.
[01:27:00.580 --> 01:27:02.179]  That is why it is so important.
[01:27:02.179 --> 01:27:03.980]  They can't stand that they can't stand that.
[01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:06.580]  That's why you saw this with the lockdowns.
[01:27:06.580 --> 01:27:10.380]  They were being so heavy-handed with contradictory people just asking
[01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:13.380]  questions and these are just me or you who aren't doctors.
[01:27:13.580 --> 01:27:15.679]  These are people who are nobodies.
[01:27:15.780 --> 01:27:17.380]  These are prominent doctors.
[01:27:17.580 --> 01:27:20.780]  This is how science works when you have a pandemic which you don't
[01:27:20.780 --> 01:27:21.780]  understand what's going on.
[01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:24.080]  There's only going to be limited information limited data and it's
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:27.280]  something that's dynamic and moving you want the best minds that
[01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:31.679]  educate you want open debate the freedom and excellence and Innovation
[01:27:31.679 --> 01:27:35.280]  is about debate, but they just go science is not asking questions.
[01:27:35.580 --> 01:27:36.580]  You cannot question me.
[01:27:36.580 --> 01:27:41.679]  I am science when Fauci said that it was so archetypally fraudulent
[01:27:41.679 --> 01:27:42.980]  and in the face of science.
[01:27:42.980 --> 01:27:45.679]  Yeah, and now here's the other thing.
[01:27:45.679 --> 01:27:48.980]  Let's let's talk about the the lab leak hypothesis.
[01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:50.780]  Let's pretend for nuts pretend.
[01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:51.880]  Let's say for the sake of argument.
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:52.780]  There's nothing to it.
[01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:56.580]  It is still of enormous importance for people to discuss.
[01:27:56.880 --> 01:28:02.179]  Is there a possibility of viruses being man-made who has this capability?
[01:28:02.179 --> 01:28:04.380]  Should these labs be doing tests with things like this?
[01:28:04.380 --> 01:28:05.880]  Like what are the consequences?
[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:09.179]  These are bioethical questions that concern us all and this is
[01:28:09.179 --> 01:28:10.380]  one-on-one type stuff.
[01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:13.580]  We talked about nuclear weapons and is it a threat nuclear weapon
[01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:16.280]  proliferation, but as soon as people start talking about the
[01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:20.380]  possibility of this being done by China of all places, which experiments
[01:28:20.380 --> 01:28:23.480]  on human beings, which has concentration camps, which oppresses
[01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:25.880]  everyone that has to be put to an end.
[01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:28.880]  I don't think it's strictly a function of the Chinese government.
[01:28:28.980 --> 01:28:32.179]  I think it's a function of we are putting forth our corporate
[01:28:32.179 --> 01:28:35.280]  narrative and if you are questioning it, that's going to make us
[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:38.679]  look less certain and if we're not certain, why are you listening
[01:28:38.679 --> 01:28:39.179]  to us?
[01:28:39.179 --> 01:28:42.179]  But if people stop listening to them, that's when they lose the
[01:28:42.179 --> 01:28:44.480]  enormous lion's share of their power.
[01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:46.179]  Well, that's right.
[01:28:46.780 --> 01:28:47.580]  Getting back to William F.
[01:28:47.580 --> 01:28:49.880]  Buckley, he came out of the Eastern establishment that founded the
[01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:50.480]  CIA.
[01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:53.380]  Yeah, and it was really an anglophile British intelligence
[01:28:53.380 --> 01:28:57.179]  organization and I don't say the British run America, but they
[01:28:57.179 --> 01:28:59.780]  handed the baton off as their Empire fell at the end of World
[01:28:59.780 --> 01:29:04.380]  War II to us and then basically imprinted themselves on us and
[01:29:04.380 --> 01:29:04.880]  I think William F.
[01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:05.880]  Buckley was a British agent.
[01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:08.780]  But it's also kind of interesting his big book that made his name
[01:29:08.780 --> 01:29:11.880]  was called God and Man at Yale and him complaining about, you
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:13.280]  know, religion being taught at Yale.
[01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:16.679]  I think nowadays virtually all conservatives or at least ones
[01:29:16.679 --> 01:29:20.480]  who kind of would I would tend to agree with more realize Yale
[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:21.679]  is not salvageable.
[01:29:21.780 --> 01:29:24.780]  Like the I shouldn't be like, how are we going to make?
[01:29:24.780 --> 01:29:29.080]  By the way, I went to Yale a few months ago and they look like
[01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:29.880]  zombies.
[01:29:30.380 --> 01:29:31.480]  Don't care what color they were.
[01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:32.780]  It just looked like a joke.
[01:29:32.780 --> 01:29:35.679]  It looked like a mental institution had been let out or something.
[01:29:35.679 --> 01:29:38.980]  I spent a lot of time there and I was like, no one looked up
[01:29:38.980 --> 01:29:39.179]  right.
[01:29:39.179 --> 01:29:40.280]  No one looks strong.
[01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:43.179]  No one was no one had any light in their eyes.
[01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:47.679]  They were just like a bunch of shuffling people around in
[01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:51.080]  jogging suits and stuff and then and I went into some of the
[01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:53.480]  classes and I went into some of the areas and it just it looked
[01:29:53.480 --> 01:29:55.380]  like a tombstone of America.
[01:29:55.380 --> 01:29:56.780]  It didn't look like a powerful place.
[01:29:56.780 --> 01:29:57.280]  Wait, hold on.
[01:29:57.280 --> 01:29:59.980]  I think you're yada yada in the best part.
[01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:03.880]  What is the reaction of the Yale student body when Alex F.
[01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:05.780]  And Jones is walking around campus?
[01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:10.380]  Hissing and screaming and debating whether I'm allowed to
[01:30:10.380 --> 01:30:10.679]  be there.
[01:30:10.679 --> 01:30:11.679]  Then they call the police on me.
[01:30:11.679 --> 01:30:12.179]  Is that true?
[01:30:12.179 --> 01:30:14.480]  And they're going get out of here like, well, he's allowed
[01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:17.780]  to know and so they were having like hundreds showed up within
[01:30:17.780 --> 01:30:18.280]  minutes.
[01:30:18.380 --> 01:30:20.080]  What brought you to Yale?
[01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:24.380]  I was already up there doing some research in the area and
[01:30:24.380 --> 01:30:25.679]  I thought let's just go to skull and bones.
[01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:28.380]  And what was crazy is I showed up there on three to two.
[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:29.780]  What's three to two?
[01:30:30.179 --> 01:30:32.380]  Well three to two is like this is the name of the chapter.
[01:30:32.380 --> 01:30:32.679]  Oh, yeah.
[01:30:32.679 --> 01:30:33.679]  Yeah, they're okay.
[01:30:33.679 --> 01:30:34.080]  Yeah.
[01:30:34.980 --> 01:30:36.380]  March March 22nd.
[01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:38.179]  So that's the thing.
[01:30:38.179 --> 01:30:40.780]  Are you the kind of person who thinks Yale is something that
[01:30:40.780 --> 01:30:44.380]  can and should be fixed or do you regard it as basically an
[01:30:44.380 --> 01:30:46.480]  alien influence on this country?
[01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:48.480]  That's been steering us in the wrong direction for over a
[01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:49.080]  hundred years.
[01:30:49.179 --> 01:30:50.980]  I have my answer people are entitled.
[01:30:50.980 --> 01:30:51.980]  Well, you know your history.
[01:30:51.980 --> 01:30:57.080]  So Yale Yale since going bones got set up is just a competing
[01:30:57.080 --> 01:30:57.980]  group of cults.
[01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:01.480]  And it's really a group of criminals around around the
[01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:01.880]  country.
[01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:04.780]  I mean, I mean, I just think of Yale and I mean, what do you
[01:31:04.780 --> 01:31:05.080]  think?
[01:31:05.080 --> 01:31:06.880]  Well, no, I want to hear more about this because you know
[01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:09.179]  much more about this kind of like a secret society stuff
[01:31:09.179 --> 01:31:09.679]  than I do.
[01:31:09.679 --> 01:31:12.880]  Like, I mean the Hellfire Clubs Benjamin Franklin was a member
[01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:16.580]  of the Hellfire Clubs when he was in was a Jefferson Oxford.
[01:31:16.679 --> 01:31:19.179]  Yeah, and you know, I was invited to Hellfire Club.
[01:31:19.380 --> 01:31:20.380]  I did not know that.
[01:31:20.380 --> 01:31:21.380]  Please tell me more.
[01:31:21.580 --> 01:31:22.480]  They still around.
[01:31:23.679 --> 01:31:24.780]  Well, let me do this.
[01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:25.980]  Let me take a piss.
[01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:28.179]  Okay, let's take a quick two-minute break and I'll come
[01:31:28.179 --> 01:31:28.380]  back.
[01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:28.880]  I'll tell you about the hell.
[01:31:28.880 --> 01:31:29.780]  Yeah, please.
[01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:31.280]  Michael Malice is here.
[01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:32.280]  Stay with us.
[01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:45.480]  Britney Spears and several other big names were groomed to
[01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:48.880]  star in the new Mickey Mouse Club during a time.
[01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:52.679]  The company was rife with pedophiles dozens of Disney
[01:31:52.679 --> 01:31:56.580]  employees have been arrested for child sex crimes, including
[01:31:56.580 --> 01:32:00.880]  top executives and directors and in some cases rehired by
[01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:04.380]  Disney to work with children after doing extremely short
[01:32:04.380 --> 01:32:08.880]  jail time for raping a child actor former Disney chairman
[01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:12.580]  and Democrat Senator George Mitchell was identified as a
[01:32:12.580 --> 01:32:16.480]  pedophile who visited Epstein Island and before that Ghislaine
[01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:20.280]  Maxwell was doing photo ops for Disney's Save the Children
[01:32:20.679 --> 01:32:24.179]  several former child stars have claimed that the industry
[01:32:24.179 --> 01:32:25.780]  is crawling with pedophiles.
[01:32:26.179 --> 01:32:29.280]  We have already heard many of their stories if we can look
[01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:31.980]  at the evidence and overcome our emotions.
[01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:33.580]  We can see what this is.
[01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:39.480]  Trauma-based mind control programs such as MKUltra and
[01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:43.179]  Project Monarch were revealed to the public via declassified
[01:32:43.179 --> 01:32:47.780]  documents in the 70s and again in the 90s with several victims
[01:32:47.780 --> 01:32:49.679]  giving testimony before Congress.
[01:32:49.980 --> 01:32:53.380]  The basis of these programs is the routine infliction of
[01:32:53.380 --> 01:32:57.580]  severe trauma upon a child in order to force their mind into
[01:32:57.580 --> 01:33:00.880]  a dissociative state allowing them to be controlled without
[01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:05.080]  awareness up until the age of 7 children live mostly in a
[01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:08.580]  hypnotic state of mind when their sense of reality is being
[01:33:08.580 --> 01:33:12.580]  written which explains why they target children specifically
[01:33:12.679 --> 01:33:16.580]  those that come from abusive households Bryce Taylor and
[01:33:16.580 --> 01:33:19.780]  Kathy O'Brien have each described in their books how they
[01:33:19.780 --> 01:33:22.880]  were regularly brought to Disneyland and Disney World where
[01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:25.980]  they would be tortured and raped while being programmed with
[01:33:25.980 --> 01:33:29.980]  Disney stories as well as Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland.
[01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:33.080]  This has been verified in CIA documents.
[01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:37.280]  O'Brien says she was tortured in a room beneath Disney World
[01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:41.080]  which we know was designed by agents of the CIA who were
[01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:45.080]  running this program at that time victims of these programs
[01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:49.280]  were sold into them by their abusive parents a model we see
[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:52.980]  today with parents pimping their children out to the entertainment
[01:33:52.980 --> 01:33:57.080]  industry Britney's parents had her audition for Disney when
[01:33:57.080 --> 01:34:00.580]  she was 8 years old where she was then brought into the industry
[01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:03.780]  sent to New York City for training and brought on the show
[01:34:03.780 --> 01:34:07.580]  three years later at age 11 where she was dressed and directed
[01:34:07.580 --> 01:34:11.780]  to perform like an adult the art of mind control was known as
[01:34:11.780 --> 01:34:15.380]  far back as Plato's allegory of the cave where people's belief
[01:34:15.380 --> 01:34:19.080]  systems were being created by illusions force fed into their
[01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:23.679]  minds story our imagination has always been influenced by
[01:34:23.679 --> 01:34:27.480]  story and if you can control the stories told to the public
[01:34:27.980 --> 01:34:31.679]  you can control their imagination since the dawn of television
[01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:35.280]  visual storytelling has been the most fundamental form of mind
[01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:41.080]  control in the modern world television movies videos and
[01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:44.179]  since the beginning we have been subjected to a long-term
[01:34:44.179 --> 01:34:48.679]  agenda of sexual subversion as each generation is born the
[01:34:48.679 --> 01:34:52.880]  stimuli becomes slightly more perverse as the Mickey Mouse
[01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:56.679]  Club grew old their young impressionable audience grew to
[01:34:56.679 --> 01:35:00.480]  perceive them as highly successful while flaunting sexual
[01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:05.780]  promiscuity and sexual assault you can destroy a society by
[01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:07.880]  destroying its sexual morality.
[01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:12.580]  This is fundamental in any society based on the family when
[01:35:12.580 --> 01:35:15.580]  our children are naturally in this theta brainwave state of
[01:35:15.580 --> 01:35:16.480]  hypnotic learning.
[01:35:16.780 --> 01:35:20.380]  They should be protected within the family and learn from them
[01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:25.380]  organically, but the emerging global state now being forced
[01:35:25.380 --> 01:35:29.280]  on us by multinational corporations and big banks want to
[01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:30.880]  destroy this society.
[01:35:31.380 --> 01:35:35.580]  They want to mold our children exploit them and even castrate
[01:35:35.580 --> 01:35:35.880]  them.
[01:35:36.679 --> 01:35:39.780]  It is now being promoted in highly produced inspirational
[01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:43.880]  show tunes and they draft laws to help facilitate all of this
[01:35:43.980 --> 01:35:47.380]  a Republican senator who has produced such films as breeding
[01:35:47.380 --> 01:35:50.880]  farm about women being kidnapped and forcibly bred for babies
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:53.880]  to be sold on the black market before they are fed to cannibals
[01:35:54.380 --> 01:35:57.179]  is pushing a bill to fund film and television.
[01:35:57.679 --> 01:35:58.980]  This is the new normal.
[01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:03.380]  This is the inverted reality being programmed into our minds
[01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:07.980]  decades of traumatic abuse has demonstrably hurt Britney Spears
[01:36:08.280 --> 01:36:12.780]  the human mind can only handle so much for so long Britney
[01:36:12.780 --> 01:36:17.280]  is a tragic symptom of society's indifference because if enough
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:21.080]  of us really wanted to we could change all of this right now
[01:36:22.380 --> 01:36:23.580]  for infowars.com.
[01:36:23.679 --> 01:36:24.480]  This is Greg Reese.
[01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:26.179]  It's Britney.
[01:36:41.780 --> 01:36:44.880]  And we got about 1015 minutes left with Michael Malice.
[01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:47.480]  I really appreciate him being here in Austin.
[01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:47.980]  Very excited.
[01:36:47.980 --> 01:36:50.080]  He's moving here because I'm a big fan.
[01:36:51.679 --> 01:36:52.480]  What we talking about before break?
[01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:53.480]  Hellfire clubs.
[01:36:54.179 --> 01:36:57.580]  You got into some secret satanic group and you don't remember
[01:36:57.580 --> 01:36:58.380]  what we're talking about.
[01:36:58.380 --> 01:36:59.980]  Is this what it's like being Alex Jones?
[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:01.280]  I actually forgot about that.
[01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:04.280]  No, I mean, don't you think that if you are the Satanist you
[01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:05.580]  obviously want Alex to come to the party?
[01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:11.480]  I think Alex would be the one who sacrificed like Burning Man.
[01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:13.380]  Yeah, no, no, seriously.
[01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:16.880]  For whatever reason I've had the Satanist trying to recruit
[01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:18.179]  me since I was like a teenager.
[01:37:18.179 --> 01:37:21.080]  Okay, and I grew up in Dallas in a very rich area and there
[01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:22.080]  was some of that going on.
[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:24.780]  I'm like, why is this senior in high school and I'm a freshman
[01:37:24.780 --> 01:37:27.380]  taking me out in a Mercedes and it was like a little bit of
[01:37:27.380 --> 01:37:29.980]  weird stuff going on, but I never got into the satanic cult.
[01:37:29.980 --> 01:37:33.080]  So a few times they almost got me involved and one time I
[01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:35.179]  actually walked out of an event that was like eyes wide shut.
[01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:35.880]  I'm not kidding.
[01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:37.080]  Well, yeah, I'm sorry.
[01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:40.380]  You're not I lay out the story.
[01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:41.980]  How does one get an invite?
[01:37:41.980 --> 01:37:43.880]  What's the invite look like to an event like this?
[01:37:44.580 --> 01:37:46.380]  Well, I don't like it now that I was super good-looking when
[01:37:46.380 --> 01:37:49.080]  I was young and the whole nine yards and I was also, you know,
[01:37:49.179 --> 01:37:49.880]  a wild guy.
[01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:51.980]  So they started like, hey, super hot girls are like, hey,
[01:37:51.980 --> 01:37:52.480]  we want to hang out.
[01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:53.780]  I'll just say it's like a regular party.
[01:37:53.780 --> 01:37:55.679]  Now the woman has sex with you a few times.
[01:37:55.780 --> 01:37:56.380]  Okay, she goes.
[01:37:56.380 --> 01:37:57.480]  I want you to go to this event.
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:37:59.780]  Oh, and then all of a sudden you're in a mansion with
[01:37:59.780 --> 01:38:00.780]  helicopter pads.
[01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:02.880]  Okay, and people and it's Satanism.
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:04.980]  Okay, and both times I'm like, I'm leaving.
[01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:06.980]  How did you know it was Satanism up?
[01:38:09.380 --> 01:38:12.080]  Anyways, you see an eyes wide shut stuff like that.
[01:38:12.780 --> 01:38:18.580]  So then I Hollywood tried to get me involved and Linkletter
[01:38:18.580 --> 01:38:20.480]  wasn't involved in all this, but he put me in a few movies.
[01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:21.980]  Who's Link, Art Linger?
[01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:22.980]  Richard Linkletter.
[01:38:22.980 --> 01:38:23.679]  Okay, who's that?
[01:38:23.780 --> 01:38:25.380]  He's a movie producer.
[01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:26.980]  Okay, he was never involved in that.
[01:38:26.980 --> 01:38:27.580]  He's in Austin.
[01:38:27.580 --> 01:38:29.980]  He didn't like Hollywood, but because of him put me in a
[01:38:29.980 --> 01:38:30.480]  few of his films.
[01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:33.880]  He contacted me, Scandard, Arkley, Waking Life and I was a
[01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:35.980]  consultant on some others, you know, hanging out with Keanu
[01:38:35.980 --> 01:38:36.780]  Reeves, all those guys.
[01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:38.780]  They come to town, Woody Harrelson, Friends of the Mall
[01:38:39.179 --> 01:38:40.480]  and they weren't devil worshipers, by the way.
[01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:41.480]  They were like separate from Hollywood.
[01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:43.280]  They didn't want to be part of it, but then I got kind of
[01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:44.380]  sucked into Hollywood for a while.
[01:38:44.380 --> 01:38:46.179]  I was in some major parties with all the top people.
[01:38:46.179 --> 01:38:49.980]  I mean very small tight-knit deals and then I got an offer
[01:38:49.980 --> 01:38:51.679]  from Oxford and the letter was here.
[01:38:51.679 --> 01:38:53.780]  The producer saw it like eight years ago and they said,
[01:38:53.780 --> 01:38:54.280]  University?
[01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:56.679]  Yeah, they want me to come speak to their Commons.
[01:38:56.679 --> 01:38:58.580]  Okay, their famous speech.
[01:38:58.580 --> 01:38:58.980]  Yes.
[01:38:59.780 --> 01:39:02.980]  And then I got a call from this big Hollywood individual and
[01:39:02.980 --> 01:39:04.980]  they said, yeah, I heard you got that letter because I hadn't
[01:39:04.980 --> 01:39:05.679]  announced this yet.
[01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:07.880]  And I said, yeah, and they said, yeah, no, you know, I went
[01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:10.179]  there and that's what's going to be going on there is you're
[01:39:10.179 --> 01:39:13.280]  going to get invited to a club and some grottos down there
[01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:13.880]  and it's an orgy.
[01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:15.080]  It's fun to get to know everybody.
[01:39:15.679 --> 01:39:17.179]  But that's the one you in the club.
[01:39:17.380 --> 01:39:18.480]  I'm like, okay, this is a little bit crazy.
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:20.880]  Then I get another call from somebody in Hollywood saying,
[01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:23.280]  hey, you're getting invited to the Hellfire Club and I'm going
[01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:26.679]  to be there and I just I declined it and I didn't go because
[01:39:26.679 --> 01:39:28.480]  once you start doing that, I mean, you know, it's like super
[01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:30.679]  hot chicks and sex and everybody takes drugs.
[01:39:30.679 --> 01:39:33.080]  It's all whatever I know people have been involved that stuff
[01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:36.179]  and then, you know, the next time a hooker dies, you know,
[01:39:36.179 --> 01:39:37.380]  I mean, it's just like eyes wide shut.
[01:39:37.380 --> 01:39:39.580]  It's exactly what you see and you know, I know Stanley
[01:39:39.580 --> 01:39:42.880]  Kubrick's daughter very well Vivian who was his protege actually
[01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:45.080]  helped to kind of direct some of his last films and did
[01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:47.780]  the music for him and stuff like Full Metal Jacket and she
[01:39:47.780 --> 01:39:48.980]  told me a lot of stuff off record.
[01:39:48.980 --> 01:39:51.080]  So how they tried to get her dad to do this and he would
[01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:51.679]  be part of it.
[01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:54.980]  So how satanic are they on a scale of like satanic to like
[01:39:54.980 --> 01:39:55.780]  Marilyn Manson, right?
[01:39:55.780 --> 01:39:57.980]  Like Marilyn Manson plays this up, but he's the performer
[01:39:57.980 --> 01:40:00.480]  like he's not a good person fine, but he's not really,
[01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:01.780]  you know sacrifice.
[01:40:01.780 --> 01:40:04.179]  No, he's doing it for shock value for shock value, right?
[01:40:04.179 --> 01:40:06.380]  No, these people have billions of dollars.
[01:40:06.380 --> 01:40:10.380]  They have huge mansions and they like the you know, the
[01:40:10.380 --> 01:40:12.780]  craziness of all these rich people showing up in mask
[01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:14.179]  because you're rich and powerful.
[01:40:14.179 --> 01:40:18.179]  So if you just go out and swing with people, you know, because
[01:40:18.179 --> 01:40:20.380]  you're whatever, you know, you want to have fun.
[01:40:20.679 --> 01:40:21.980]  They're going to rat you out.
[01:40:22.580 --> 01:40:25.179]  But if you go to events and have sex with people and sometimes
[01:40:25.179 --> 01:40:28.780]  somebody dies, nobody rats anybody right and then next
[01:40:28.780 --> 01:40:29.580]  it's kids Jeffrey.
[01:40:29.580 --> 01:40:32.280]  I've seen all that but it's definitely definitely occultism.
[01:40:32.380 --> 01:40:34.580]  But I mean, it's not like I'm saying like I'm proud of this
[01:40:34.580 --> 01:40:35.080]  stuff.
[01:40:35.980 --> 01:40:39.280]  I literally you know, they tried to recruit me to that.
[01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:41.680]  I mean John Harmon is my oldest producer here.
[01:40:41.680 --> 01:40:42.879]  He does affiliate relations now.
[01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:46.879]  He's worked with me for 19 years 18 years and he was right
[01:40:46.879 --> 01:40:48.879]  there when Rothkop had the Kissinger Group tried to hire
[01:40:48.879 --> 01:40:51.080]  me and said come to New York, you know, we're going to hire
[01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:52.680]  you and I said this is not off-record.
[01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:55.480]  He's like no it was not it was so he said join the New World
[01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:56.280]  Order come here.
[01:40:56.280 --> 01:40:58.379]  We're the we're the elite you're going to lead the Liberty
[01:40:58.379 --> 01:40:59.379]  Movement all this stuff.
[01:40:59.379 --> 01:41:00.980]  So I got the William F Buckley speech.
[01:41:00.980 --> 01:41:04.780]  I know he got or he's probably put there up front from Yale.
[01:41:04.980 --> 01:41:07.980]  I mean, I've been I've been literally given the speech by
[01:41:07.980 --> 01:41:11.280]  by Rothkop and then three other times off-record up in the
[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:14.379]  top of a 50-story building, you know, and like I mean I had
[01:41:14.379 --> 01:41:16.879]  this major CEO of a major media company goes you like my
[01:41:16.879 --> 01:41:20.280]  wife because you can fuck my wife right now in front of me
[01:41:20.379 --> 01:41:21.680]  just sign this contract Alex.
[01:41:21.780 --> 01:41:24.379]  You're gonna be a star you the woman was incredibly hot
[01:41:24.680 --> 01:41:26.680]  and he like Elvira but in her prime.
[01:41:26.780 --> 01:41:28.379]  He goes you want to my wife right now.
[01:41:28.379 --> 01:41:29.980]  You can my wife get everything you want.
[01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:32.680]  I just want you to join us right now be a star and not be
[01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:33.680]  on this failed crusade.
[01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:35.080]  You're on Wow.
[01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:39.080]  I literally had a CIA former section chief get on his knees
[01:41:39.879 --> 01:41:42.280]  and asked me to join Obama and they would fix everything.
[01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:45.480]  I was crying and I'm not trying to tell you this stuff like,
[01:41:45.580 --> 01:41:49.180]  you know, like this is real this this really goes on.
[01:41:49.180 --> 01:41:51.980]  This is how they want you to sell your soul to them.
[01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:54.980]  You literally get the offers but isn't the concern that then
[01:41:54.980 --> 01:41:56.980]  you're going to out them or is that they're so powerful that
[01:41:56.980 --> 01:41:57.879]  no one's going to believe you.
[01:41:57.879 --> 01:41:59.480]  Oh, let me explain reason.
[01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:00.680]  I'm not been killed or put in prison.
[01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:03.680]  Yeah, please the minute you take anything from them.
[01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:05.379]  They will kill your ass in a second.
[01:42:05.379 --> 01:42:06.879]  Okay, it's a metaphysical deal.
[01:42:06.980 --> 01:42:09.379]  Okay, you don't it's like Little Mermaid signs the contract
[01:42:09.379 --> 01:42:11.980]  in her voice and Ursula goes I've got you the minute you
[01:42:11.980 --> 01:42:13.080]  sign a deal with them.
[01:42:13.180 --> 01:42:14.280]  You're there's they have these rules.
[01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:17.080]  I've never taken anything from okay, and that's why they just
[01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:19.480]  begged me just please and they don't do it anymore.
[01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:21.780]  They haven't they haven't tried to get me to join them and
[01:42:23.480 --> 01:42:24.680]  I don't know six seven years.
[01:42:24.780 --> 01:42:26.480]  Is it so no, no five years.
[01:42:26.580 --> 01:42:29.180]  I don't know if you're familiar with the historian that is
[01:42:29.180 --> 01:42:29.480]  Russell.
[01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:30.379]  I was on his show.
[01:42:30.379 --> 01:42:30.879]  He was on mine.
[01:42:30.879 --> 01:42:33.879]  I remember but by the way, that wasn't that wasn't fiction.
[01:42:33.879 --> 01:42:35.280]  I just told you that's all that's real.
[01:42:35.379 --> 01:42:39.180]  Okay, so that made the point that both of Obama's parents
[01:42:39.180 --> 01:42:40.080]  were at CIA.
[01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:42.680]  They were yeah, this is not Alex Jones making it, you know,
[01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:44.879]  whatever look at you could look it up and it's a fact.
[01:42:44.980 --> 01:42:47.080]  Yeah, so and the grandfather.
[01:42:47.180 --> 01:42:47.379]  Yeah.
[01:42:47.379 --> 01:42:49.080]  So can you can you talk a little about that?
[01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:51.379]  Because again, as soon as someone says the word CIA we're
[01:42:51.379 --> 01:42:53.379]  trained to think this person is crazy, right?
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:55.980]  Well, my dad got recruited by a group above the CIA.
[01:42:56.180 --> 01:42:58.680]  What's what's above this like the BIA it doesn't even have
[01:42:58.680 --> 01:42:59.080]  a name.
[01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:02.180]  Okay, because he was top of his class in the state and so
[01:43:02.180 --> 01:43:03.080]  in high school.
[01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:05.780]  He was at UT already and he thought he was son.
[01:43:05.780 --> 01:43:09.080]  His mom was like a principal and academic and you know had
[01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:12.080]  a degree in English and all this stuff and there was like
[01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:13.280]  a PhD in English or whatever.
[01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:14.879]  So she knows Shakespeare forwards and backwards.
[01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:15.780]  I was a little kid.
[01:43:15.780 --> 01:43:18.080]  I go there to be read me Shakespeare all day smart lady.
[01:43:18.780 --> 01:43:22.080]  She was like, well, I want to sign David up for NASA and
[01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:24.180]  he wasn't being signed up for NASA, but he got out of it
[01:43:24.180 --> 01:43:27.580]  by college and but it was like by the time he was 15.
[01:43:27.580 --> 01:43:29.879]  It's like we're sending you to MD Anderson for the for the
[01:43:29.879 --> 01:43:34.180]  summer, but it was like and it was like cancer research
[01:43:34.180 --> 01:43:37.480]  stuff like like like like like you'd think oh this CIA is
[01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:39.080]  all glamorous and the stuff's all fun.
[01:43:39.379 --> 01:43:42.379]  It was all seeing let's put kids in government research
[01:43:42.379 --> 01:43:45.680]  programs with lethal cancer drugs and see if they'll sit
[01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:48.680]  there while we're giving people lethal dosages and stuff
[01:43:48.879 --> 01:43:50.280]  just to see how they're affected by it.
[01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:53.379]  And so my dad later after I was already on the air told
[01:43:53.379 --> 01:43:54.980]  me all this when I knew about it for my grandmother.
[01:43:55.080 --> 01:43:58.180]  He was like in high school with his kid, you know, and
[01:43:58.180 --> 01:44:00.580]  doing all the stuff at UT and MD Anderson, but it wasn't
[01:44:00.580 --> 01:44:04.080]  until my film Endgame was about to come out 14 years ago
[01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:07.080]  and he watched it at my studio before it was released and
[01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:07.879]  my mother looks to him.
[01:44:07.879 --> 01:44:10.680]  She goes David, this isn't true and he just spilt his guts
[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:12.980]  about all that and it wasn't that he was even that special
[01:44:13.180 --> 01:44:17.180]  industrial level hiring of all the smartest brains to join
[01:44:17.180 --> 01:44:19.680]  this eugenics cult, but I'm interviewing you my friend.
[01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:22.180]  We're going no this sure you're interviewing me, but this
[01:44:22.180 --> 01:44:24.879]  something I do really want to know is it your belief that
[01:44:24.879 --> 01:44:27.879]  Obama and this I don't think this is at all absurd because
[01:44:27.879 --> 01:44:29.379]  like how else did this end up happening?
[01:44:29.580 --> 01:44:32.180]  Is it your belief that Obama had was groomed from a young
[01:44:32.180 --> 01:44:34.280]  age to be a kind of CIA operative?
[01:44:34.780 --> 01:44:37.480]  Yes, and I would love to come on your show again and
[01:44:37.480 --> 01:44:38.480]  actually cover all this.
[01:44:39.080 --> 01:44:43.080]  There's a guy named Gilbert who cracked the case on this.
[01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:46.480]  They set up the whole Kenya thing as a setup to make us
[01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:47.080]  look like idiots.
[01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:48.680]  Okay, he was born in Hawaii, right?
[01:44:48.680 --> 01:44:53.080]  He's American citizen and he put in the Harvard Law Review
[01:44:53.080 --> 01:44:56.680]  that he was the editor of for two years that I was born in
[01:44:56.680 --> 01:44:58.379]  Kenya. It says it in the front.
[01:44:58.379 --> 01:45:01.180]  His wife says in speeches Michelle.
[01:45:01.180 --> 01:45:03.580]  Oh my I mean my husband from like, you know before he got
[01:45:03.580 --> 01:45:04.879]  elected is from Kenya.
[01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:09.980]  So that that was not his dad that guy looked like a Central
[01:45:09.980 --> 01:45:12.480]  African, you know, very handsome guy, but very dark black
[01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:18.580]  guy. His dad is a famous communist pornographer and head
[01:45:18.580 --> 01:45:21.980]  of the Communist Party in Illinois then the Frank Marshall
[01:45:21.980 --> 01:45:24.680]  Davis and it's not just in the film.
[01:45:25.980 --> 01:45:27.180]  I was able when I saw this.
[01:45:27.180 --> 01:45:29.080]  I thought this was so unbelievable this came out like
[01:45:29.080 --> 01:45:31.879]  what was it eight years ago, whatever I was not a big
[01:45:31.879 --> 01:45:34.680]  porn aficionado, but I knew I could go online and look at
[01:45:34.680 --> 01:45:39.379]  famous 1950s 60s kind of Betty page stuff and there was
[01:45:39.379 --> 01:45:39.879]  his mom.
[01:45:39.879 --> 01:45:42.879]  These photos are online the ones that are private collection
[01:45:43.580 --> 01:45:44.780]  with Obama's mother.
[01:45:44.780 --> 01:45:50.379]  It was a sex operative of the CIA and it's admitted that
[01:45:50.780 --> 01:45:52.480]  he was basically given his degrees.
[01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:55.980]  He lived all over the world his grandfather around major
[01:45:55.980 --> 01:45:59.480]  banks and Frank Marshall Davis was a double agent FBI
[01:45:59.480 --> 01:45:59.879]  operative.
[01:45:59.879 --> 01:46:03.680]  His mom was a CIA sex operative and absolutely.
[01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:06.180]  So that's the whole truth.
[01:46:06.180 --> 01:46:07.180]  And so he was not from Kenya.
[01:46:07.180 --> 01:46:11.080]  He was an American citizen and they put that out day one.
[01:46:11.080 --> 01:46:13.180]  They're the ones that put that out to get us to chase after
[01:46:13.180 --> 01:46:15.780]  it so that they would distract away from Frank Marshall
[01:46:15.780 --> 01:46:17.480]  Davis very skilled.
[01:46:17.680 --> 01:46:20.180]  Yeah, that's I think a lot of times, you know, how people
[01:46:20.180 --> 01:46:22.879]  historically talk about the devil being very having a
[01:46:23.080 --> 01:46:26.480]  gilded tongue and being sophisticated the face this
[01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:28.879]  something else you think about when you're you know raised
[01:46:28.879 --> 01:46:32.080]  in a Russian household evil people are very sophisticated.
[01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:34.080]  They're not going to come in there with a shirt that says
[01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:35.180]  I'm the bad guy.
[01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:36.980]  They're not going to have horns and tails.
[01:46:36.980 --> 01:46:39.080]  They're going to look just like you and me or maybe more
[01:46:39.080 --> 01:46:42.180]  like you than like me because you know, but it's it's not
[01:46:42.180 --> 01:46:44.280]  something that's going to be obvious and they use these
[01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:47.980]  techniques to try to get people complete distracted because
[01:46:47.980 --> 01:46:48.879]  it's like misdirection.
[01:46:48.980 --> 01:46:51.180]  If you go to see Penn and Teller his hands doing this over
[01:46:51.180 --> 01:46:53.180]  here, but meanwhile, he's doing something in his pocket.
[01:46:53.180 --> 01:46:54.780]  Well, exactly and my dad was a good guy.
[01:46:54.980 --> 01:46:56.180]  He got out of it.
[01:46:56.580 --> 01:46:58.680]  He won't even ever tell me anything about this stuff.
[01:46:58.780 --> 01:46:59.580]  He just said yeah.
[01:46:59.580 --> 01:47:03.080]  No, it was you know going on and then I was digging around
[01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:03.980]  after my grandmother died.
[01:47:03.980 --> 01:47:05.780]  Some of the stuff at the house was like him getting, you
[01:47:05.780 --> 01:47:07.879]  know, accepted these things and being part of these things
[01:47:07.879 --> 01:47:10.180]  but there's those two tracks like everybody thinks you get
[01:47:10.180 --> 01:47:11.680]  the CIA being a Green Beret in the army.
[01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:12.879]  That's the best way in the old days.
[01:47:12.980 --> 01:47:15.379]  There's any guys that kill people but but really by the
[01:47:15.379 --> 01:47:20.680]  60s it segued into humet leftist operatives for the
[01:47:20.680 --> 01:47:23.280]  globalist agenda to pose as a black person, which you now
[01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:24.379]  see in a bigger manifestation.
[01:47:24.379 --> 01:47:27.080]  It was black lives matter and it was done in the medical
[01:47:27.080 --> 01:47:29.280]  Corps and you see the global takeover through the medical
[01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:32.780]  system. So the highest level of these controllers of the
[01:47:32.780 --> 01:47:36.280]  technocrats is medical and so my dad got fast-tracked right
[01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:39.980]  into the here's an example when he signed up for this when
[01:47:39.980 --> 01:47:40.980]  he was like 14.
[01:47:41.480 --> 01:47:45.379]  He won this Union Carbide Award for an essay.
[01:47:45.379 --> 01:47:48.080]  He wrote about physics or something and all of a sudden
[01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:50.879]  an 18-wheeler one day pulls up at our ranch in East Texas
[01:47:51.180 --> 01:47:54.680]  and says here are the parts to a ruby laser build it.
[01:47:54.680 --> 01:47:56.280]  Here's a camera take photos of it.
[01:47:56.280 --> 01:47:57.580]  Do it see what you do.
[01:47:57.780 --> 01:48:00.180]  My dad built the laser which wasn't fully explaining how
[01:48:00.180 --> 01:48:04.180]  to do it turned into a particle beam and fried his eyes was
[01:48:04.180 --> 01:48:06.480]  blind for a couple months and yeah, then they were like,
[01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:08.680]  oh God, we really want you now when he built the laser.
[01:48:08.980 --> 01:48:09.680]  So I'm just telling you man.
[01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:10.580]  These people are crazy.
[01:48:10.780 --> 01:48:13.280]  But back then they were all into let's test the humet and
[01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:16.080]  let's it wasn't just him but they're like sitting 18 wheelers
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:18.680]  with lasers of some dude in East Texas when he's 14 years
[01:48:18.680 --> 01:48:20.180]  old. This is what I'm talking about.
[01:48:20.180 --> 01:48:21.780]  This is really advanced.
[01:48:21.780 --> 01:48:23.580]  These people are smart and that's they would do how to
[01:48:23.580 --> 01:48:26.680]  entice and seduce somebody that the highest test scores in
[01:48:26.680 --> 01:48:28.980]  Texas. I think for most America, I'm sorry.
[01:48:28.980 --> 01:48:30.379]  I know you're supposed to be interviewing me but this one
[01:48:30.379 --> 01:48:32.180]  I really want to know if I think for most Americans they
[01:48:32.180 --> 01:48:34.180]  don't really understand the distinction between the CIA
[01:48:34.180 --> 01:48:36.280]  and the FBI and they view them as large interchangeables
[01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:39.379]  both kind of security apparatus of the federal government
[01:48:39.580 --> 01:48:42.080]  are is it like one of the good guys one of the bad guys
[01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:43.780]  are they basically the same what is same thing?
[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:47.580]  Okay, so that there's probably 10 factions of the CIA
[01:48:47.980 --> 01:48:49.980]  probably 20 factions of the FBI.
[01:48:49.980 --> 01:48:51.280]  It's all for everything's factions.
[01:48:51.480 --> 01:48:52.879]  Okay, this officers factions.
[01:48:53.180 --> 01:48:57.680]  I mean, it's just the way things work and the FBI is
[01:48:58.780 --> 01:49:02.680]  this through the legal system being counting cases covering
[01:49:02.680 --> 01:49:03.080]  their ass.
[01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:04.680]  They're all about how they look at what they do in the
[01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:08.080]  CIA is just balls the walls craziness, you know, just
[01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:10.879]  absolutely run everything control everything you control
[01:49:10.879 --> 01:49:13.680]  every Hollywood star you control every organization control
[01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:16.080]  influence run it all and really it's just a bunch of people
[01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:17.879]  getting rich and having sex.
[01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:21.580]  Why why haven't or maybe they haven't I mean the CIA is
[01:49:21.580 --> 01:49:24.280]  far more glamorous except that was the old CIA.
[01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:24.680]  Okay.
[01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:27.480]  Now every leftist wants the CIA credential to feel powerful.
[01:49:27.580 --> 01:49:31.080]  It's their little bean County academics that write up policy
[01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:32.180]  reports to control history.
[01:49:32.379 --> 01:49:34.879]  So there's two sides the CIA that creates fake history and
[01:49:34.879 --> 01:49:36.580]  then the CIA that actually runs around controlling things
[01:49:36.580 --> 01:49:37.180]  and killing people.
[01:49:37.379 --> 01:49:40.580]  But how does the FBI relate to those two positions?
[01:49:40.580 --> 01:49:45.379]  Like I said, the FBI is a Praetorian intimidation arm that
[01:49:45.379 --> 01:49:49.080]  is meant to bust low-level criminals and then put heat on
[01:49:49.080 --> 01:49:50.680]  people the political establishment wants.
[01:49:50.980 --> 01:49:53.080]  So it's like the GRU in Russia.
[01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:53.780]  It's internal.
[01:49:53.780 --> 01:49:57.580]  Yeah, and the KGB would be external like FSB is external
[01:49:57.879 --> 01:50:00.980]  and then and then you know same thing with the CIA supposedly
[01:50:00.980 --> 01:50:01.580]  external.
[01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:05.680]  I mean on paper the FBI is domestic and the CIA is international
[01:50:05.879 --> 01:50:09.080]  but it's just it's entered the CIA is British intelligence.
[01:50:09.080 --> 01:50:11.280]  Okay, the CIA was set up by British intelligence.
[01:50:11.280 --> 01:50:13.580]  It's not it again.
[01:50:13.580 --> 01:50:16.580]  It's not that the British runners we absorb the British.
[01:50:16.580 --> 01:50:17.879]  Yeah, and that's what it is.
[01:50:18.180 --> 01:50:19.080]  So this is the question.
[01:50:19.080 --> 01:50:21.379]  I can't believe I took me this long to ask even all the time
[01:50:21.379 --> 01:50:25.379]  we talked J Edgar Hoover was there since Woodrow Wilson.
[01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:27.280]  I think he I don't know when he died, but it was at least
[01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:29.280]  Nixon is he was around in the 20s.
[01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:31.480]  Yeah, is he as he invented library cards?
[01:50:31.780 --> 01:50:33.280]  It's a tell me like let's hear about yes.
[01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:36.480]  He is he is such an important figure that we don't discuss.
[01:50:36.980 --> 01:50:38.480]  Well, he's the father of the surveillance.
[01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:39.280]  Yes, he is.
[01:50:39.780 --> 01:50:42.680]  Yeah, that's what the FBI does is blackmail people right and
[01:50:42.680 --> 01:50:44.580]  then and then it's the group that's allowed to blackmail
[01:50:44.580 --> 01:50:46.879]  domestic because again, if you're going to set up an intelligence
[01:50:46.879 --> 01:50:49.480]  agency to blackmail and kill foreigners, you don't want to
[01:50:49.480 --> 01:50:51.680]  turn that big great white shark loose domestically.
[01:50:51.879 --> 01:50:54.580]  So then you have lawyers this domestic thing you supposedly
[01:50:54.580 --> 01:50:58.980]  keep controlled, but of course it doesn't we now the capital
[01:50:59.180 --> 01:51:01.180]  the Democrats passed 2 billion dollars to create a new
[01:51:01.180 --> 01:51:03.480]  Praetorian Guard where they're setting up offices of the
[01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:04.680]  Capitol Police around the country.
[01:51:04.879 --> 01:51:05.379]  Is that true?
[01:51:05.480 --> 01:51:08.780]  Oh, yeah, but is is J Edgar Hoover just got announced
[01:51:08.780 --> 01:51:11.980]  yesterday is J Edgar Hoover as malevolent a figure as many
[01:51:11.980 --> 01:51:12.980]  people receive him to be.
[01:51:14.780 --> 01:51:15.580]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:51:15.580 --> 01:51:16.879]  I mean, he definitely was black.
[01:51:16.879 --> 01:51:20.580]  I mean, I've I've seen the hearings and I read the transcripts
[01:51:20.580 --> 01:51:22.680]  in the early 50s where he would get up in Congress and say
[01:51:22.879 --> 01:51:24.580]  LaCosa Nostra does not exist.
[01:51:24.879 --> 01:51:28.379]  What yeah, the Mafia they would say the Mafia doesn't exist
[01:51:28.379 --> 01:51:31.879]  and it wasn't until they wiretapped and recorded that
[01:51:32.080 --> 01:51:34.180]  upstate New York meeting of the mobsters that they had to
[01:51:34.180 --> 01:51:36.280]  prove it because good FBI agents documented.
[01:51:36.280 --> 01:51:39.879]  So there's been a lot of great FBI agents, but I mean the old
[01:51:39.879 --> 01:51:43.080]  FBI was like anti-communist and they got the FBI to do illegal
[01:51:43.080 --> 01:51:45.980]  things the name of fighting communism, but then they lost
[01:51:45.980 --> 01:51:50.480]  their soul in that process and now the FBI is just I mean
[01:51:50.580 --> 01:51:52.879]  the average FBI agent that deals with bank robberies and
[01:51:52.879 --> 01:51:55.379]  kidnapped kids are good people, but they're that that's one
[01:51:55.379 --> 01:51:57.280]  FBI then you got the FBI at the top.
[01:51:57.280 --> 01:52:00.080]  It's totally political jacked into everything and just
[01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:00.580]  involved in it.
[01:52:00.879 --> 01:52:04.480]  So is it true that he basically had president after president
[01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:05.180]  under his thumb?
[01:52:05.780 --> 01:52:08.480]  Yes, and they finally I got sick of he was probably killed.
[01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:09.980]  Okay, huh?
[01:52:10.080 --> 01:52:12.680]  That's that's that's yeah, this is that's a name that I think
[01:52:12.680 --> 01:52:15.980]  is not commonly used in America anymore and his power right?
[01:52:15.980 --> 01:52:18.580]  He was much more powerful in many ways than Kennedy was but
[01:52:18.580 --> 01:52:21.180]  everyone knows who JFK is but J Edgar Hoover is not a household.
[01:52:21.180 --> 01:52:23.980]  Well, J Edgar Hoover is the great example of the deep state.
[01:52:23.980 --> 01:52:24.280]  Okay.
[01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:24.480]  Yeah.
[01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:24.879]  Yeah, right.
[01:52:24.879 --> 01:52:25.480]  He's the father.
[01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:26.480]  He's the deep state, right?
[01:52:26.480 --> 01:52:29.080]  That's the exact right the things they did with Martin was
[01:52:29.080 --> 01:52:31.379]  the king and I think every president knew he had a dossier
[01:52:31.379 --> 01:52:33.580]  on them and he would sit them down and tell them this is how
[01:52:33.580 --> 01:52:34.480]  it is and how it's going to be.
[01:52:34.580 --> 01:52:35.580]  Yeah, like take Putin.
[01:52:35.580 --> 01:52:39.780]  Putin was obviously KGB and was involved with all those
[01:52:39.780 --> 01:52:43.680]  things, but he was a power vacuum with Yeltsin and he saw
[01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:44.980]  Russia being exploited.
[01:52:45.180 --> 01:52:47.080]  So he said instead of foreign bankers running things.
[01:52:47.080 --> 01:52:51.080]  I'll just step in carve stuff up divide it up and create
[01:52:51.080 --> 01:52:53.480]  some nationalism, but obviously a strong man in that model.
[01:52:54.580 --> 01:52:58.280]  So with him, it's not like he was this long-term character
[01:52:58.280 --> 01:53:01.480]  like Hoover, but then at the end of the day, he is like the
[01:53:01.480 --> 01:53:04.080]  Russian deep state but but it's crazy to see a deep state
[01:53:04.080 --> 01:53:07.680]  where that's what they all want the globalist Envy Putin
[01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:09.780]  because he is actually in charge.
[01:53:09.879 --> 01:53:11.280]  He is actually the deep state.
[01:53:11.480 --> 01:53:13.780]  He actually came up through the system himself.
[01:53:13.879 --> 01:53:16.480]  And so he's what they all wish they were so you can say yeah,
[01:53:16.480 --> 01:53:17.180]  he kills people.
[01:53:17.180 --> 01:53:21.180]  Yeah, he he does all this but he is actually a guy that
[01:53:21.180 --> 01:53:23.780]  did it himself and that's that's what they really fear is
[01:53:23.780 --> 01:53:27.180]  the embodiment of somebody that's a leader who is actually
[01:53:27.180 --> 01:53:30.280]  in charge and who is actually running the deep state itself
[01:53:30.280 --> 01:53:30.879]  at the same time.
[01:53:31.080 --> 01:53:33.280]  So that's like the trifecta of all the things they fear.
[01:53:33.379 --> 01:53:35.879]  But isn't that kind of like George HW Bush who was head
[01:53:35.879 --> 01:53:37.080]  of the CIA before?
[01:53:37.680 --> 01:53:41.879]  Very Putin-esque but but didn't have the charisma charisma
[01:53:41.879 --> 01:53:43.180]  or gravitas or energy.
[01:53:43.480 --> 01:53:43.780]  Yeah.
[01:53:43.780 --> 01:53:43.980]  Yeah.
[01:53:43.980 --> 01:53:44.280]  Yeah.
[01:53:44.780 --> 01:53:47.080]  So there's Uncle Vlad.
[01:53:47.180 --> 01:53:49.780]  Yeah, quite a character right there and they can't stand it
[01:53:49.780 --> 01:53:53.280]  because he's all you know, he's beating them and he's not
[01:53:53.280 --> 01:53:55.180]  he's promoting having kids and not destroying.
[01:53:55.180 --> 01:53:58.379]  He's not perfect but they hate him because he's not anti-human.
[01:53:58.580 --> 01:53:58.980]  Yeah.
[01:53:59.080 --> 01:54:02.879]  Yeah, and also because he I think what Putin does which
[01:54:02.879 --> 01:54:06.280]  drives people crazy is when they try to there was an interview
[01:54:06.280 --> 01:54:08.680]  recently, which I'm sure you saw you probably covered where
[01:54:08.680 --> 01:54:11.080]  people trying to get him to denounce certain aspects of
[01:54:11.080 --> 01:54:13.379]  Russian culture goes what's the difference in America?
[01:54:13.379 --> 01:54:15.080]  You guys have that you pull the same shenanigans.
[01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:16.480]  So don't get on your high horse with me.
[01:54:17.680 --> 01:54:20.180]  Well, yeah, he said you've got 500 people.
[01:54:20.180 --> 01:54:22.980]  Most of them just walked in to the velvet ropes.
[01:54:22.980 --> 01:54:24.680]  You got them in solitary confinement.
[01:54:24.879 --> 01:54:25.879]  So I got so I've
[01:54:27.379 --> 01:54:29.580]  yeah, it's like make sure your house is clean before you're
[01:54:29.580 --> 01:54:30.180]  criticizing me.
[01:54:30.180 --> 01:54:32.480]  He said get the beam out of your eye.
[01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:32.680]  Yeah.
[01:54:32.680 --> 01:54:34.080]  Yeah before you get the speck out of mine.
[01:54:34.180 --> 01:54:38.379]  Yeah, he's not a good person to put it mildly but to claim
[01:54:38.379 --> 01:54:40.680]  that he's the villain and you know, everyone in Washington
[01:54:40.680 --> 01:54:43.680]  is well, he's not trying to convince Russian boys to chop
[01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:44.580]  their testicles off.
[01:54:45.879 --> 01:54:46.480]  That's true.
[01:54:47.180 --> 01:54:50.379]  No, I mean, seriously, I'm all for Russia.
[01:54:50.580 --> 01:54:51.480]  I'm all for China.
[01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:53.180]  I'm all for Venezuela.
[01:54:53.180 --> 01:54:53.879]  I don't care.
[01:54:54.080 --> 01:54:56.879]  I want leaders that want to empower their people empower
[01:54:56.879 --> 01:54:59.580]  families and empower free speech and I know Putin they'll
[01:54:59.580 --> 01:54:59.780]  go.
[01:54:59.780 --> 01:55:02.280]  Oh my God Putin arrested these people that are going in
[01:55:02.280 --> 01:55:05.980]  desecrating churches to create a riot CIA funded.
[01:55:06.080 --> 01:55:08.780]  Well, I don't want to put up with the Russians sinning agents
[01:55:08.780 --> 01:55:12.680]  to piss on Orthodox churches or whatever.
[01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:13.480]  I'd say arrest them.
[01:55:13.980 --> 01:55:16.280]  And these are foreign powers trying to bring down Russia.
[01:55:16.379 --> 01:55:17.580]  I'm not a Russophile.
[01:55:17.980 --> 01:55:20.980]  I've never even been to Russia, but I can see a country under
[01:55:20.980 --> 01:55:22.879]  leftist attack that is trying to reject it.
[01:55:23.080 --> 01:55:25.180]  So I think Russians should all have their free speech.
[01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:27.180]  But if you're not a Russian and you're there trying to cause
[01:55:27.180 --> 01:55:29.180]  a riot arrest you and throw your ass out of the country.
[01:55:29.180 --> 01:55:30.280]  Wait, you've never been to Russia?
[01:55:30.280 --> 01:55:30.680]  Nope.
[01:55:30.780 --> 01:55:33.379]  Oh, we definitely have to go then that is going to be amazing.
[01:55:33.680 --> 01:55:35.580]  Well, you know, I'm the one on Twitter before it got banned
[01:55:35.580 --> 01:55:36.780]  that like they sent me my visa.
[01:55:36.780 --> 01:55:39.280]  I was going to go and then so much was going on and I was
[01:55:39.280 --> 01:55:41.280]  at a custody battle max wife and I said, I'm not going to
[01:55:41.280 --> 01:55:41.580]  go.
[01:55:41.980 --> 01:55:43.680]  They go look the secret visa.
[01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:44.480]  He's a Russian.
[01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:45.580]  I put that out.
[01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:46.980]  Yeah.
[01:55:46.980 --> 01:55:48.780]  Yeah, it's going to be I want to go to Russia.
[01:55:48.879 --> 01:55:49.680]  Yeah, we'll do it.
[01:55:49.780 --> 01:55:51.080]  We'll do it as soon as it opens up.
[01:55:51.379 --> 01:55:52.780]  But see, I was talking to Roger Stone.
[01:55:52.780 --> 01:55:53.379]  I forgot about it.
[01:55:53.379 --> 01:55:54.379]  He goes this is not a joke.
[01:55:54.379 --> 01:55:56.580]  And I said stop saying you're getting indicted.
[01:55:56.580 --> 01:55:58.280]  This is ridiculous because I knew he wasn't involved in
[01:55:58.280 --> 01:56:00.180]  any of that because I was there trying to get WikiLeaks
[01:56:00.180 --> 01:56:01.680]  on I knew WikiLeaks wouldn't talk to us.
[01:56:01.879 --> 01:56:03.480]  So the idea that we were in control WikiLeaks was just
[01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:03.680]  insane.
[01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:07.080]  He worked here then and we're going to go to Andrew Tarba
[01:56:07.080 --> 01:56:07.379]  folks.
[01:56:07.379 --> 01:56:08.780]  We want to break I see him right there.
[01:56:09.180 --> 01:56:11.080]  Hey, listen, you've been asking me questions.
[01:56:11.080 --> 01:56:12.780]  So that was a joke when you said I'm interrupting.
[01:56:13.180 --> 01:56:15.280]  Well, no, I mean, I'm curious to hear your perspective.
[01:56:15.280 --> 01:56:17.480]  Anyone can you know, there's lots of things that you're
[01:56:17.480 --> 01:56:19.580]  the only one who kind of has been covering this stuff for
[01:56:19.580 --> 01:56:22.879]  decades and you always have an unorthodox point of view.
[01:56:23.379 --> 01:56:24.680]  Well, I want to go to Russia.
[01:56:24.780 --> 01:56:27.480]  Yeah, I want to go to Israel doesn't mean I work for the
[01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:29.879]  Jews either, you know, because when I said I was going to
[01:56:29.879 --> 01:56:32.879]  rush like oh my God, it's the proof think about what a red
[01:56:32.879 --> 01:56:35.680]  scare that is and now the left never really went through
[01:56:35.680 --> 01:56:37.780]  much of a red scare compared to what they've done now with
[01:56:37.780 --> 01:56:40.780]  deplatforming and talk about McCarthy the stuff they've
[01:56:40.780 --> 01:56:41.780]  done to Andrew Tarba.
[01:56:41.780 --> 01:56:43.379]  What about what about Mitch McConnell?
[01:56:43.379 --> 01:56:44.980]  They call him Moscow Mitch.
[01:56:44.980 --> 01:56:47.680]  I mean, they're accusing him basically of treason on a
[01:56:47.680 --> 01:56:48.379]  regular basis.
[01:56:48.379 --> 01:56:50.580]  And I bet it called him Beijing Mitch now that is that
[01:56:50.580 --> 01:56:50.980]  true?
[01:56:51.379 --> 01:56:51.780]  Oh, no.
[01:56:52.180 --> 01:56:54.280]  Well, no, but they should he's more connected to China
[01:56:54.280 --> 01:56:55.080]  than he is to the food.
[01:56:55.080 --> 01:56:56.879]  Yeah, I don't want to take up Andrew's time.
[01:56:56.879 --> 01:56:59.980]  So hey, listen, I appreciate you spending so much time with
[01:56:59.980 --> 01:57:00.780]  us on the Saturday.
[01:57:00.980 --> 01:57:02.980]  Andrew Torba is amazing.

[01:57:04.180 --> 01:57:05.780]  But first anything else you want to add?
[01:57:05.780 --> 01:57:08.480]  How do people find you just go to anarchist handbook.com

[01:57:27.180 --> 01:57:27.980]  That's politically correct.
[01:57:27.980 --> 01:57:32.680]  Anyways, she I would love her if she was a six, but she's
[01:57:32.680 --> 01:57:35.280]  a 11 in Spinal Tap 11.

[01:59:28.180 --> 01:59:31.379]  Few days ago, the Southern Poverty Law Center came out with
[01:59:31.379 --> 01:59:35.080]  a report demonizing Twitter and it used the same arguments
[01:59:35.080 --> 01:59:37.980]  it's used against our next guest.
[01:59:38.580 --> 01:59:38.780]  Mr.
[01:59:38.780 --> 01:59:40.879]  Torbo who?
[01:59:42.180 --> 01:59:44.780]  Is just operating with the internet operated three years ago
[01:59:44.780 --> 01:59:47.780]  where Facebook Twitter YouTube anybody let folks have their
[01:59:47.780 --> 01:59:50.680]  own sites on social media as long as they didn't call for
[01:59:50.680 --> 01:59:53.379]  violence or engage in criminal activity.
[01:59:53.680 --> 01:59:56.180]  So the founder of gab Andrew Torbo joins us.
[01:59:56.580 --> 01:59:58.780]  We really appreciate him taking time out of his busy schedule
[01:59:58.780 --> 01:59:59.680]  to talk about this.
[02:00:00.080 --> 02:00:04.480]  Well within two days of this happening Nick point as whether
[02:00:04.480 --> 02:00:05.379]  you love him or hate him.
[02:00:05.780 --> 02:00:08.480]  He has been banned as well.
[02:00:09.980 --> 02:00:10.980]  He's not just been suspended.
[02:00:10.980 --> 02:00:11.879]  He's been expelled.
[02:00:11.980 --> 02:00:15.379]  He's been permanently banned and we have the SPLC policing
[02:00:15.379 --> 02:00:19.379]  Twitter saying that they're they're not banning all these
[02:00:19.379 --> 02:00:19.980]  conservatives.
[02:00:19.980 --> 02:00:21.280]  Well, they already banned the president.
[02:00:21.680 --> 02:00:22.480]  So that's not enough.
[02:00:22.480 --> 02:00:25.180]  So this is a very very dangerous situation to send them
[02:00:25.180 --> 02:00:29.680]  they do to gab and Andrew Torbo and all their users saying
[02:00:29.980 --> 02:00:32.379]  hey, we need government to shut them down.
[02:00:32.379 --> 02:00:33.280]  We need lawsuits.
[02:00:33.280 --> 02:00:36.780]  We need the FBI to get involved because somebody might say
[02:00:36.780 --> 02:00:38.780]  something they're not supposed to will are going to say
[02:00:38.780 --> 02:00:39.680]  something over the telephone.
[02:00:39.680 --> 02:00:41.480]  You're not supposed to you know, say something over the
[02:00:41.480 --> 02:00:41.980]  radio.
[02:00:41.980 --> 02:00:43.180]  Can you call in the talk radio?
[02:00:43.280 --> 02:00:44.379]  We have to ban that too.
[02:00:44.480 --> 02:00:45.780]  This is so draconian.
[02:00:45.780 --> 02:00:47.379]  It's obviously the threat.
[02:00:47.680 --> 02:00:50.080]  Then you got the left calling anyone that promotes freedom
[02:00:50.080 --> 02:00:54.180]  on white supremacist and three weeks ago the new policy
[02:00:54.180 --> 02:00:56.980]  report put up with the president the puppet president saying
[02:00:57.780 --> 02:01:02.080]  questioning elections is terrorism questioning lockdowns
[02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:02.680]  is terrorism.
[02:01:02.680 --> 02:01:03.780]  This is so draconian.
[02:01:03.879 --> 02:01:05.980]  So Andrew Torbo, thanks for joining us.
[02:01:05.980 --> 02:01:08.280]  You're always a mild-mannered polite fellow, but I'm gonna
[02:01:08.280 --> 02:01:11.379]  try to give you the floor here in the next 20-30 minutes
[02:01:11.379 --> 02:01:14.280]  to just lay out what's happened what you've been through
[02:01:14.280 --> 02:01:16.780]  and where you see this going because we were just on the
[02:01:16.780 --> 02:01:19.480]  show three days ago and you said, you know, they're going
[02:01:19.480 --> 02:01:21.680]  after everybody now they're going after Twitter and Twitter
[02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:24.680]  is responding to this to this mob.
[02:01:24.680 --> 02:01:25.680]  It's it's so dangerous.
[02:01:26.980 --> 02:01:27.379]  Yeah, Alex.
[02:01:27.379 --> 02:01:28.879]  Well, thank you for having me as always.
[02:01:28.879 --> 02:01:30.180]  It's a pleasure to be here.
[02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:33.180]  Let's look through the flax with this Nick Fuentes man,
[02:01:33.180 --> 02:01:33.480]  right?
[02:01:33.480 --> 02:01:36.980]  So Nick is a Christian man who believes in putting America
[02:01:36.980 --> 02:01:38.980]  first and Americans first.
[02:01:38.980 --> 02:01:40.780]  That's you know, that's his ideology.
[02:01:41.080 --> 02:01:42.280]  Nothing more nothing less.
[02:01:42.780 --> 02:01:46.080]  We see the SPLC come out a few days ago and put a hit piece
[02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:49.780]  on Twitter as a whole with specifically targeting the fact
[02:01:49.780 --> 02:01:52.480]  that he was still on Twitter the very next day.
[02:01:52.480 --> 02:01:56.379]  We see the ADL come out and do a hit piece on Nick Fuentes
[02:01:56.379 --> 02:01:58.280]  as well the day after that.
[02:01:58.280 --> 02:01:59.980]  He was suspended by Twitter.
[02:01:59.980 --> 02:02:02.879]  So the question is does Twitter run its own company or do
[02:02:02.879 --> 02:02:06.080]  we have these special interest groups like the SPLC in the
[02:02:06.080 --> 02:02:09.980]  ADL that are, you know, strong arming these private companies
[02:02:09.980 --> 02:02:11.480]  into doing their bidding.
[02:02:11.980 --> 02:02:15.180]  This is really I don't think it's a coincidence that you
[02:02:15.180 --> 02:02:16.780]  know, Nick Fuentes is a Christian.
[02:02:16.780 --> 02:02:17.580]  You're a Christian.
[02:02:17.580 --> 02:02:18.480]  I'm a Christian.
[02:02:18.680 --> 02:02:20.780]  Who are the biggest targets of no platforming?
[02:02:20.780 --> 02:02:23.280]  Who are the people that the cabal is going after?
[02:02:23.480 --> 02:02:26.379]  It's Christians and there's a there's a very clear trend
[02:02:26.379 --> 02:02:29.879]  here. You know, you see the ADL calling for the Department
[02:02:29.879 --> 02:02:33.280]  of Justice to shut down my website because I allow free
[02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:35.680]  speech. Now, we don't allow threats of violence.
[02:02:35.680 --> 02:02:37.280]  We don't allow illegal activity.
[02:02:37.379 --> 02:02:39.879]  We actually have a really great relationship with law enforcement
[02:02:39.879 --> 02:02:43.080]  to keep criminals and criminal activity off of our website,
[02:02:43.280 --> 02:02:44.980]  but the ADL doesn't care about that.
[02:02:45.080 --> 02:02:48.080]  What they care about is controlling the narrative and controlling
[02:02:48.080 --> 02:02:52.080]  the flow of information and because I refuse to bend to their
[02:02:52.080 --> 02:02:56.080]  demands over banning certain people like yourself or others
[02:02:56.480 --> 02:02:57.580]  from our platform.
[02:02:58.080 --> 02:02:59.480]  They attack me personally.
[02:02:59.480 --> 02:03:00.879]  They come after my family.
[02:03:00.980 --> 02:03:04.480]  They want me locked up in jail Alex even the ADL what they
[02:03:04.480 --> 02:03:09.379]  said is that because I sign my emails with the quote Jesus
[02:03:09.379 --> 02:03:13.680]  is King that that is a thinly veiled version of anti-semitism.
[02:03:13.680 --> 02:03:16.680]  So they're saying that as a Christian me saying Jesus is
[02:03:16.680 --> 02:03:18.280]  King is anti-semitism.
[02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:20.980]  This should be a very big wake-up call to all the Christians
[02:03:20.980 --> 02:03:23.580]  who are watching and by the way to non-Christians as well.
[02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:27.180]  We are being targeted for simply allowing the free flow of
[02:03:27.180 --> 02:03:29.480]  information and for people to speak their minds.
[02:03:29.680 --> 02:03:31.080]  We don't allow legal activity.
[02:03:31.080 --> 02:03:32.580]  We don't allow threats of violence.
[02:03:32.980 --> 02:03:36.180]  We've always had a very clear line on that but you know,
[02:03:36.480 --> 02:03:38.080]  we're going to have to do something about this.
[02:03:38.080 --> 02:03:40.680]  We're going to have to build you know what they want to do
[02:03:40.680 --> 02:03:42.780]  Alex and I think you understand this quite well is they're
[02:03:42.780 --> 02:03:44.680]  trying to gaslight us into violence.
[02:03:44.680 --> 02:03:48.180]  They're trying to see how far can they push us before we
[02:03:48.180 --> 02:03:51.680]  start to get violent and I would strongly recommend not falling
[02:03:51.680 --> 02:03:55.280]  for that deception and manipulation and in a trap what
[02:03:55.280 --> 02:03:58.680]  we need to do, you know regimes come and go right Alex all
[02:03:58.680 --> 02:04:01.879]  throughout history powerful tyrannical regimes have come
[02:04:01.879 --> 02:04:05.180]  and gone and yet our people remain and yet the Patriots
[02:04:05.180 --> 02:04:09.480]  remain we will rebuild and we are rebuilding right now and
[02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:12.180]  that's what I would recommend to people is start to build
[02:04:12.180 --> 02:04:14.980]  right now, you know, that's why they hate you because you
[02:04:14.980 --> 02:04:18.080]  are a real Christian you love God and you're married you're
[02:04:18.080 --> 02:04:21.080]  having children you're betting on humanity and they're threatened
[02:04:21.080 --> 02:04:23.879]  by that and everybody knows you're on a white supremacist
[02:04:23.879 --> 02:04:26.780]  and it just flies in the face of them invoking that shows
[02:04:26.780 --> 02:04:27.580]  they're the race baiters.
[02:04:27.580 --> 02:04:28.280]  They're the racist.
[02:04:29.379 --> 02:04:29.980]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:04:29.980 --> 02:04:30.180]  Yeah.
[02:04:30.180 --> 02:04:33.080]  I'm a straight white Christian male with a family and I'm
[02:04:33.080 --> 02:04:36.780]  married and I have kids and I am enemy number one to this
[02:04:36.780 --> 02:04:38.180]  tyrannical regime, right?
[02:04:38.180 --> 02:04:40.280]  I am everything that they loathe and everything that they
[02:04:40.280 --> 02:04:43.480]  hate, you know, because I love Jesus Christ and I proclaim
[02:04:43.480 --> 02:04:46.780]  his name very openly as a public figure as the CEO of a
[02:04:46.780 --> 02:04:47.780]  social network.
[02:04:47.879 --> 02:04:51.680]  There are no other public social media CEOs that are proclaiming
[02:04:51.680 --> 02:04:54.480]  the name of Christ that I can tell you and that is one of
[02:04:54.480 --> 02:04:56.879]  the big reasons why I think that they're attacking me so much
[02:04:56.879 --> 02:05:00.680]  is because they know that Christ and the gospel is really the
[02:05:00.680 --> 02:05:01.480]  only way out of this.
[02:05:01.480 --> 02:05:03.680]  It's the only thing that's going to give people hope.
[02:05:03.780 --> 02:05:06.280]  It's the only thing that's going to give people salvation
[02:05:06.280 --> 02:05:08.680]  from all they fear it, which is why we know it's real and
[02:05:08.680 --> 02:05:10.580]  2,000 years ago, we were told what would happen.
[02:05:10.680 --> 02:05:12.379]  It's happening exactly right now.
[02:05:13.180 --> 02:05:15.480]  Oh, yeah, Christ warned us about this house Christ warned
[02:05:15.480 --> 02:05:17.680]  us that you know first they came for him and they're going
[02:05:17.680 --> 02:05:20.580]  to come for us that you know, we will be persecuted.
[02:05:20.580 --> 02:05:22.980]  We can expect this as Christians for 2,000 years.
[02:05:22.980 --> 02:05:25.980]  We've been persecuted, you know for loving Christ and for
[02:05:25.980 --> 02:05:28.180]  sharing the gospel and that doesn't mean that we should
[02:05:28.180 --> 02:05:28.879]  cower in fear.
[02:05:28.879 --> 02:05:32.080]  I think a lot of Christians, you know are afraid of their
[02:05:32.080 --> 02:05:32.480]  identity.
[02:05:32.480 --> 02:05:35.080]  They're afraid of proclaiming the name of Christ.
[02:05:35.180 --> 02:05:37.280]  They don't talk about Christ at work.
[02:05:37.280 --> 02:05:38.680]  They don't talk about Christ at school.
[02:05:38.680 --> 02:05:40.480]  They don't talk about Christ with their friends.
[02:05:40.879 --> 02:05:43.480]  So, you know, they basically are an in the closet Christian
[02:05:43.680 --> 02:05:45.580]  and that's not how we're commanded to live.
[02:05:45.580 --> 02:05:48.879]  We're commanded to speak the truth boldly and to make disciples
[02:05:48.879 --> 02:05:51.379]  out of all the nations and to share the Word of God with
[02:05:51.379 --> 02:05:54.879]  other people if you know, we're just living this private life
[02:05:54.879 --> 02:05:57.280]  where you know, we're only Christian when we walk in a church
[02:05:57.280 --> 02:05:57.780]  on Sunday.
[02:05:57.780 --> 02:06:01.580]  That's not very Christian life and as depressing as this is
[02:06:01.580 --> 02:06:04.780]  it actually makes me rejoice to see it all being fulfilled.
[02:06:04.780 --> 02:06:06.080]  It means my God's real.
[02:06:06.280 --> 02:06:07.680]  I've already had spiritual experiences.
[02:06:07.680 --> 02:06:08.680]  I already know it's real.
[02:06:08.879 --> 02:06:11.780]  I've already I won't get into it on air, but I prayed to God
[02:06:11.780 --> 02:06:13.680]  and things and I've just been shown amazing things.
[02:06:14.280 --> 02:06:17.280]  So as negative as it is God has sent me the Holy Spirit as
[02:06:17.280 --> 02:06:20.180]  a comforter that the Bible talks about I've now experienced
[02:06:20.180 --> 02:06:22.580]  that and it seems like I've known you for a long time since
[02:06:22.580 --> 02:06:23.980]  you launched this five six years ago.
[02:06:24.180 --> 02:06:26.780]  You're a Christian, but it seems like your faith has gotten
[02:06:26.780 --> 02:06:28.080]  stronger under persecution.
[02:06:28.980 --> 02:06:29.580]  Absolutely.
[02:06:29.580 --> 02:06:33.580]  No, I mean the Holy Spirit has radically transformed my heart
[02:06:33.580 --> 02:06:38.280]  my mind my body and my soul and you know by clinging to that
[02:06:38.280 --> 02:06:42.280]  cross and embracing my faith and embracing Christ, you know
[02:06:42.280 --> 02:06:43.480]  when I'm persecuted.
[02:06:43.780 --> 02:06:44.580]  That's what I do.
[02:06:45.180 --> 02:06:46.580]  I go I look to my Bible.
[02:06:46.580 --> 02:06:50.180]  I pray I ask for prayer from our community members of millions
[02:06:50.180 --> 02:06:53.180]  of Christians around the world and that's what we need to do
[02:06:53.180 --> 02:06:54.180]  right now as Christians.
[02:06:54.180 --> 02:06:55.680]  Well, we should not fear the world.
[02:06:55.680 --> 02:06:58.180]  We shouldn't we don't we really have nothing to fear except
[02:06:58.180 --> 02:06:58.680]  for God.
[02:06:58.680 --> 02:06:59.280]  That's it.
[02:06:59.879 --> 02:07:01.480]  We have the nuclear weapons.
[02:07:02.680 --> 02:07:02.980]  Yeah.
[02:07:02.980 --> 02:07:03.379]  Yeah.
[02:07:03.379 --> 02:07:06.680]  Absolutely Jesus is the we got we already got it all.
[02:07:07.680 --> 02:07:10.480]  We have the creator of the universe on our side.
[02:07:10.580 --> 02:07:13.480]  It doesn't matter how much money how much power how much
[02:07:13.580 --> 02:07:16.480]  resources that these people have these wicked and evil people
[02:07:16.480 --> 02:07:19.480]  and power have they do not have the creator of the universe
[02:07:19.480 --> 02:07:20.379]  on their side.
[02:07:20.480 --> 02:07:23.879]  We do and we need to remember that and we need to cling to
[02:07:23.879 --> 02:07:26.980]  the cross and we need to share the gospel and bring people
[02:07:26.980 --> 02:07:29.879]  to Christ and get back to Christ and get back in the church
[02:07:30.080 --> 02:07:32.580]  and get back to building our families building our local
[02:07:32.580 --> 02:07:34.980]  communities and building up ourselves as well.
[02:07:34.980 --> 02:07:38.080]  I think you know far too many people get sucked into the
[02:07:38.080 --> 02:07:41.379]  the negativity and all of the the horror horrific things
[02:07:41.379 --> 02:07:44.180]  that are going on, you know, we see them coming after our
[02:07:44.180 --> 02:07:46.580]  children now with this propaganda.
[02:07:46.580 --> 02:07:49.480]  We see them coming after our family members.
[02:07:49.780 --> 02:07:52.180]  We see them coming after our freedoms and our civil liberties,
[02:07:52.180 --> 02:07:55.379]  but you know what they can never come after is our faith.
[02:07:55.580 --> 02:07:56.980]  They can never take that away from us.
[02:07:56.980 --> 02:07:59.379]  And that's one thing that we really need to hold on to
[02:07:59.379 --> 02:08:00.780]  especially now more than ever.
[02:08:01.080 --> 02:08:02.680]  That's the only way that we're going to come out of this
[02:08:02.680 --> 02:08:06.180]  on the other side is by you know, relying on God and leaning
[02:08:06.180 --> 02:08:06.879]  in on God.
[02:08:06.980 --> 02:08:07.379]  That's right.
[02:08:07.379 --> 02:08:09.580]  Andrew since you raised this I want to play a three and a
[02:08:09.580 --> 02:08:15.680]  half minute clip of the quote gay choir government-funded
[02:08:15.680 --> 02:08:16.680]  in San Francisco.
[02:08:16.879 --> 02:08:19.280]  They attacked me this morning and a bunch of articles and
[02:08:19.280 --> 02:08:20.580]  said I called for violence.
[02:08:20.580 --> 02:08:23.379]  I did not so I love that make themselves the victims.
[02:08:23.379 --> 02:08:25.080]  They say we're going to corrupt your kids.
[02:08:25.480 --> 02:08:26.879]  We're coming for your children.
[02:08:27.180 --> 02:08:30.280]  We're going to take them from you and then we say no, we
[02:08:30.280 --> 02:08:34.080]  don't want that with all the recruiting we see and it's
[02:08:34.080 --> 02:08:35.980]  Satanic and you look at all these men.
[02:08:35.980 --> 02:08:36.879]  It's a cult.
[02:08:36.980 --> 02:08:41.080]  It's an army of men saying we're non-threatening we act
[02:08:41.080 --> 02:08:44.180]  effeminate, but we're going to get your children and then
[02:08:44.180 --> 02:08:45.580]  this is the Zeitgeist everybody.
[02:08:45.580 --> 02:08:48.180]  I know knows this you critica something let me tell you
[02:08:48.180 --> 02:08:48.580]  folks.
[02:08:49.780 --> 02:08:52.780]  I don't hate people guys because they like guys or girls
[02:08:52.780 --> 02:08:53.379]  to like girls.
[02:08:53.379 --> 02:08:56.580]  I'm not but I know that whatever is happening with what they've
[02:08:56.580 --> 02:08:59.780]  done spiritually that when you do that it opens you up to
[02:08:59.780 --> 02:09:02.580]  this anti-human spirit and the people that serve this then
[02:09:02.580 --> 02:09:06.780]  become these monsters that want to have my children and it's
[02:09:06.780 --> 02:09:09.780]  all I'm saying is, you know, leave me alone.
[02:09:09.780 --> 02:09:11.879]  They're like, no, we're not going to leave you alone and
[02:09:11.879 --> 02:09:14.680]  they've got the full power and Klaus Schwab the head of the
[02:09:14.680 --> 02:09:17.980]  Davos group says we need more gay TV characters.
[02:09:18.180 --> 02:09:22.480]  Well, we know why so no one has children and and so here's
[02:09:22.480 --> 02:09:27.480]  this pedophilic desk declaration of war against us and then
[02:09:27.480 --> 02:09:31.780]  all these articles gay men's chorus jokes about converting
[02:09:31.780 --> 02:09:35.180]  kids and Alex Jones pounces, but it's not a joke and they
[02:09:35.180 --> 02:09:36.780]  won't show the video on the article.
[02:09:36.879 --> 02:09:39.080]  They want to just say oh nothing happened Jones made this
[02:09:39.080 --> 02:09:41.480]  up, but we saved the video.
[02:09:41.580 --> 02:09:42.879]  Here's what they don't want you to see.
[02:09:44.780 --> 02:09:49.379]  We are grooming the new generation of Americans to be fully
[02:09:49.379 --> 02:09:52.980]  embracing of diversity and inclusivity and for the children
[02:09:52.980 --> 02:09:55.280]  and the people that supported are going to realize that this
[02:09:55.280 --> 02:09:57.780]  is going to be the grooming of the next generation.
[02:09:57.879 --> 02:10:00.680]  That's the whole goal is to make kids that aren't used to
[02:10:00.680 --> 02:10:03.379]  seeing something like me more comfortable to seeing it.
[02:10:03.379 --> 02:10:06.780]  No one's there to push an agenda on anyone.
[02:10:07.080 --> 02:10:11.879]  No one's there to persuade people or to recruit people
[02:10:11.980 --> 02:10:14.379]  who wants to be a drag queen when they grow up.
[02:10:14.379 --> 02:10:17.280]  You could be a drag queen superhero learn to love learn
[02:10:18.280 --> 02:10:24.180]  your children.
[02:10:24.580 --> 02:10:27.379]  Someone's got to teach them not to hate.
[02:10:48.180 --> 02:10:52.980]  Your children will care about fairness and justice for others.
[02:10:53.379 --> 02:10:57.280]  Your children will work to convert all the sisters and
[02:10:57.280 --> 02:10:59.580]  brothers then soon.
[02:10:59.580 --> 02:11:06.080]  They're almost certain your kids will start.
[02:11:17.280 --> 02:11:40.480]  It's almost over folks.
[02:11:40.480 --> 02:11:41.980]  I'm sorry we have to document this.
[02:11:48.280 --> 02:11:49.879]  Then we'll turn to you.
[02:11:58.180 --> 02:12:00.580]  Go and turn up that disco.
[02:12:00.780 --> 02:12:05.580]  You'll forget you were ever upset.
[02:12:18.280 --> 02:12:29.280]  And we have to warn you ladies and gentlemen, if you've got
[02:12:29.280 --> 02:12:32.580]  young or impressionable children in your household bring them
[02:12:32.580 --> 02:12:33.780]  to the screen right now.
[02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:38.379]  And we witnessed parents taking their children as young as
[02:12:38.379 --> 02:12:43.580]  two inside to take part talking singing and reading we can
[02:12:43.580 --> 02:12:47.080]  both be grooms to an audience of preschoolers toddlers and
[02:12:47.080 --> 02:12:48.080]  their caregivers.
[02:12:52.180 --> 02:12:55.080]  We have just confirmed that a registered child sex offender
[02:12:55.080 --> 02:12:58.580]  has been reading to children at a Houston Public Library as
[02:12:58.580 --> 02:13:01.180]  part of its drag queen story hour.
[02:13:01.180 --> 02:13:04.180]  My media spokesperson for the library confirms one of those
[02:13:04.180 --> 02:13:09.080]  drag queens Tatiana Malinina is really Alberto Garza a child
[02:13:09.080 --> 02:13:10.780]  sex offender in 2008.
[02:13:10.780 --> 02:13:13.480]  He was convicted of assaulting an eight-year-old boy.
[02:13:13.580 --> 02:13:16.379]  This is Tatiana Malinina my sister from Queens of the week.
[02:13:16.480 --> 02:13:18.879]  People seem to walk away having a good time.
[02:13:18.879 --> 02:13:20.080]  I start them young, right?
[02:13:22.780 --> 02:13:23.280]  All right.
[02:13:23.280 --> 02:13:25.780]  I appreciate Andrew Torba joining us on the Saturday.
[02:13:25.780 --> 02:13:26.379]  I got him on late.
[02:13:26.379 --> 02:13:27.180]  I apologize.
[02:13:27.379 --> 02:13:31.180]  No, he just had a great new addition to the family a son
[02:13:31.580 --> 02:13:34.080]  and to watch these people coming after our children.
[02:13:34.080 --> 02:13:36.780]  This is so Satanic and that's why Gabs there.
[02:13:36.780 --> 02:13:39.180]  So people have a place to say no to this.
[02:13:39.180 --> 02:13:43.680]  I mean the lines between good and evil are so clear now.
[02:13:43.780 --> 02:13:44.980]  What do you think is happening?
[02:13:44.980 --> 02:13:46.280]  And what's your response to that?
[02:13:47.379 --> 02:13:51.180]  Yeah, you know as a father of two children now this this is
[02:13:51.180 --> 02:13:52.580]  just horrific to me, right?
[02:13:52.580 --> 02:13:55.480]  It's demonic and this is what they're doing.
[02:13:55.480 --> 02:13:57.780]  They want to they're telling us this Alex, right?
[02:13:57.780 --> 02:13:59.879]  It's not even like they're trying to be subtle about it.
[02:13:59.980 --> 02:14:02.379]  They are telling us that they are coming for our children.
[02:14:02.379 --> 02:14:04.080]  And I'm so glad that you're documenting this.
[02:14:04.280 --> 02:14:05.280]  I know it's painful.
[02:14:05.280 --> 02:14:08.980]  It was painful for me to sit here and watch that but I think
[02:14:09.080 --> 02:14:10.780]  you know, these things are being scrubbed from the internet.
[02:14:10.780 --> 02:14:13.780]  They scrubbed that video from YouTube after it came out that
[02:14:13.780 --> 02:14:17.280]  many of the people in that video were registered sex offenders
[02:14:17.379 --> 02:14:20.379]  and this is every single time with these people they say
[02:14:20.379 --> 02:14:22.280]  openly that we're coming for your kids.
[02:14:22.379 --> 02:14:23.980]  They're already registered sex offenders.
[02:14:23.980 --> 02:14:26.379]  So they have a history of coming for kids and everybody
[02:14:26.379 --> 02:14:28.580]  sits around and just acts like this is normal.
[02:14:28.680 --> 02:14:31.980]  And meanwhile, if I say Jesus is king on Twitter, I get banned.
[02:14:32.080 --> 02:14:35.379]  This is madness and this is why we must cling to the cross
[02:14:35.379 --> 02:14:38.379]  now more than ever and we must bring people to the faith and
[02:14:38.379 --> 02:14:40.480]  that's that's the only way out of this Christ is the only
[02:14:40.480 --> 02:14:41.080]  way out of this.
[02:14:41.080 --> 02:14:43.379]  And by the way, we bow down to all these fake Protestant
[02:14:43.379 --> 02:14:44.680]  Catholic preachers everything.
[02:14:44.980 --> 02:14:47.480]  I was on the Orthodox Church endorsed vaccinations.
[02:14:48.080 --> 02:14:50.680]  We have to be leaders where we're humble people, but we have
[02:14:50.680 --> 02:14:54.780]  to be leaders men and women but men particularly as you're
[02:14:54.780 --> 02:14:58.180]  saying and just declared Jesus Christ the churches won't
[02:14:58.180 --> 02:14:58.379]  do it.
[02:14:58.379 --> 02:15:00.580]  The churches are not even opposing most of the stuff.
[02:15:00.780 --> 02:15:02.180]  We have to be the church now.
[02:15:03.080 --> 02:15:05.480]  The churches are not only not opposing it.
[02:15:05.480 --> 02:15:07.280]  They're endorsing it and you're right.
[02:15:07.280 --> 02:15:09.180]  It's it's at every level of the faith, right?
[02:15:09.180 --> 02:15:10.879]  It's it's Catholicism.
[02:15:10.879 --> 02:15:11.780]  It's Protestants.
[02:15:11.780 --> 02:15:15.680]  It's it's now the Orthodox Church is embracing the vaccines.
[02:15:15.879 --> 02:15:19.280]  So it's it's every level of the church hierarchy across every
[02:15:19.280 --> 02:15:21.879]  branch of the faith has been subverted by the enemy.
[02:15:22.080 --> 02:15:24.780]  But the enemy has not subverted our own hearts and the enemy
[02:15:24.780 --> 02:15:26.580]  has not subverted us as individuals.
[02:15:26.580 --> 02:15:28.879]  So we need to get strong in our faith.
[02:15:28.879 --> 02:15:31.879]  We need to get strong in our own local communities and resist
[02:15:31.879 --> 02:15:34.280]  this stuff and start building back.
[02:15:34.280 --> 02:15:38.180]  We need to build back and we need to build up we are not
[02:15:38.379 --> 02:15:41.879]  destroyers Alex, you know the these people on the left and
[02:15:41.879 --> 02:15:43.879]  these these demons that are in power.
[02:15:44.080 --> 02:15:44.980]  They're destroyers.
[02:15:45.080 --> 02:15:48.680]  They seek to imitate the gospel and subvert the gospel and
[02:15:48.680 --> 02:15:52.080]  subvert the words of Christ to subvert, you know hundreds of
[02:15:52.080 --> 02:15:53.980]  millions of Christians to do their bidding.
[02:15:54.379 --> 02:15:56.280]  But that is not what the gospel is about.
[02:15:56.280 --> 02:15:59.480]  That was not what the message of Christ was about and we need
[02:15:59.480 --> 02:16:03.180]  to hold fast to the truth that we know in our hearts and let
[02:16:03.180 --> 02:16:06.080]  the Holy Spirit guide us as leaders as individuals in our
[02:16:06.080 --> 02:16:07.280]  own local communities.
[02:16:07.480 --> 02:16:11.080]  And you know, God has blessed both you and I with these
[02:16:11.080 --> 02:16:13.980]  tremendous platforms in front of so many millions of people
[02:16:14.180 --> 02:16:17.180]  and we have to be great stewards of God's Word and great
[02:16:17.180 --> 02:16:20.480]  examples as Christians to to other Christians to give them
[02:16:20.480 --> 02:16:22.680]  hope because you know, they're going to their church and
[02:16:22.680 --> 02:16:26.080]  they're not finding any resistance to this demonic stuff.
[02:16:26.080 --> 02:16:28.580]  In fact, they're finding their pastors and their priests
[02:16:28.780 --> 02:16:30.980]  embracing this stuff which is madness.
[02:16:31.180 --> 02:16:33.680]  So, you know, we need to give people hope and we need to be
[02:16:33.680 --> 02:16:35.380]  positive and we need to embrace.
[02:16:35.480 --> 02:16:38.080]  I totally agree with you and and you know, we can sit here
[02:16:38.080 --> 02:16:39.380]  and we can pull back from this.
[02:16:40.820 --> 02:17:10.820]  It's so obviously demonic what they're doing just like you were just saying I mean it's so anti-human it's so obvious this should be rejected and that's why they don't want to gab it's why they don't even want to Twitter they don't want any place we can come together and agree that we're being gaslit that you know they hate that what two of us do on earth and what two of us agree upon on earth God agrees to in heaven and that means when we're right we know we're right
[02:17:10.820 --> 02:17:40.820]  we love God we make a decision as two humans together to do something about it God uses that as the pretext of free will to then do it we have to make the free will decision then God gives us the electrical charge and they they fear in their takeover with everything they do Christians coming together the lockdowns banning churches you know a year after Walmart's open they are so afraid of what's happening in these churches brother yeah and this is why I reject the term hate speech because you know if you look at our Bible we're
[02:17:40.820 --> 02:18:10.820]  commanded to hate that which is evil we don't hate people we hate the evil right and we're commanded to call it out and to speak the truth boldly you know we have no tolerance for evil and we should have no tolerance for evil but it seems many Christians are openly embracing evil and embracing wickedness because they've just been misled and brainwashed by the enemy for so many decades now and they're not reading their Bibles they're you know they're not you know actively discussing Christ or the gospel with their
[02:18:10.820 --> 02:18:40.820]  friends or their family or their co-workers they basically walk into church on Sunday for an hour and you know they call themselves a Christian and many of them aren't even doing that and still you know call themselves a Christian you know now is the time for a great revival and a great reformation in Christendom and in our own you know souls we need to start with ourselves look in the mirror first reform your own heart first and you know embrace Christ and the Holy Spirit will be indwelled in you and work through you to do good
[02:18:40.820 --> 02:19:10.820]  and to to take this country back and to take to take our freedoms back because they're being stripped away and you know I again I see the the common tread here the common trend is that they're coming after Christians you know I'm not allowed Alex to accept these are a MasterCard credit or debit cards for my business I've been banned from multiple banks I've been banned from multiple payment processors I've been banned from hosting providers from you name it you know have you reached out to bonzino's new thing no no I haven't
[02:19:10.820 --> 02:19:40.820]  tried that I did see that he started a payment processor well we reached out to him before he said a year ago oh my sponsors they said oh we don't do business with you so I'm not I'm not a guy that like starts fights with folks but we've reached out we've given them all our banking stuff we have perfect credit if if they don't do it for us I'm gonna go to war with bonzino it's not a threat but we put bonzino on the map we like bonzino he already though with his last sponsor said no to us so it's a big deal if he's running ads saying oh we'll take your payment processing then he better do it yeah maybe I should apply too
[02:19:40.820 --> 02:20:10.820]  and see what happens although I highly doubt that he'll he'll accept gab for payment processing but that'll be interesting on that note you know we're working on a solution to that ourselves called a minute you got it brother I think that's the future I'm not as technical as you exactly what is the future of us they're trying to put us in a gulag we're smart how do we because the whole future is how do we build something that is the conservatives Christians would flock to that across the world yeah I mean we're working on that right now so we're working on something called
[02:20:10.820 --> 02:20:40.820]  gab pay which is essentially going to be the free speech PayPal and we're going to allow people to sign up for a gab pay account hook up their bank account and then they can send money peer-to-peer between one another you know without financial censorship as long as you're not doing anything illegal or breaking the law you'll be allowed to use the service this is something that is a tremendous choke point in the free speech movement just a few years ago everyone agreed that was what America was about communism fascism is about
[02:20:40.820 --> 02:21:10.820]  imagine now that we're like hunted already shut down like hoping desperately we have some place to be able to do business I mean this is so sick I mean what they have done to me what they have done to you what they're doing to Nick Fuentes right now they're going to be doing to churches they're going to be doing to Christian organizations they're going to be doing to you know just people who refuse to toe the line of the American oligarch regime so we need to prepare for that right now and that's why you know I started gab five years ago
[02:21:10.820 --> 02:21:40.820]  I knew that this level of censorship that we're seeing would inevitably get here and that's why now I'm seeing you know over the next five years the financial part of this where you know people are getting banned from banks people are getting banned from payment processors they're not allowed to buy or sell you know that is where things are going next that's where they're escalating things to and not just for people like you or me but for average everyday normal American people so you know we need to build that infrastructure right now today which is what we're working on in preparation for that because that is where this is headed
[02:21:40.820 --> 02:22:10.699]  I agree well I really appreciate your time and the few minutes we have left here what else do you want to impart to people Mr. Torba about gab because I've seen this on Infowars.com and I've seen this in the comments listeners are like why don't you promote gab more why don't you on your show and your article say go to gab and I totally agree I've told my writers do it I've told my crew do it we do post you know embedded things from gab more but I
[02:22:10.699 --> 02:22:33.699]  really should that's why we're having you on the show make gab a bigger deal because parlor sold out all the others rolled over Trump can't even get a side what you're doing is so important and and you're their big target of hey let's shut down somebody that tried to build their own thing we should all rally behind gab we should empower you we should support you we should pray for you how do we do that because a lot of folks are watching
[02:22:33.699 --> 02:22:34.420]  yeah I mean the first thing you do is prayer is is definitely number one you know it's it's really difficult on my family and on myself and on my team what we do is not easy we have a lot of long grueling days it's been a long five years but you know that's the cross we carry to defend free speech online what people should know about gab.com is that we're the home of free speech if it's protected by the First Amendment it's protected on gab we don't allow any illegal activity we don't allow threats of violence and it's the internet as it always has been since the inception of the first
[02:23:03.699 --> 02:23:33.699]  it's the inception of the internet it's the free flow of information it's speak your mind if you don't like what someone's saying you don't have to associate with them you can block or mute them you don't have to follow them so it's free association with free speech and soon we're going to have a free market we are the leading alternative to Silicon Valley oligarchies and you know that's not going to change there's been a lot of people who've tried to intimidate or imitate what we're doing and intimidate me and try to buy me out and try to make threats on my family and
[02:23:33.699 --> 02:23:45.699]  threats on my business and threats on you know me personally in order to get us to stop building but you know again I cling to that cross and I cling to my faith and we're not going to stop building we're going to keep going
[02:23:45.699 --> 02:24:15.140]  Andrew I'm going to interrupt but let's talk about because we're not victims we're overcomers we have Christ but listeners should know that it's a sign of you're doing the right thing you're under attack I know a lot of this is stuff off records they have you signing on disclosure meet with a corporate group they want to give you an offer I've been through this probably 20 times I haven't had these conversations with you I'm just guessing what is it like though when they're offering you that 20 million dollars that 50 million dollars that 100 million dollars which I've been offered to sell out because for me it's so easy
[02:24:15.699 --> 02:24:38.699]  even entertaining the offer I feel God pulling away from me and that that is so scary that like fear of God is not fear that God's going to hurt you it's fear of separation so I'm sitting there anytime I'm not going to sell out but I'll look at their deal and I literally feel like God going so I'm not putting words in your mouth that's my experience what's your experience
[02:24:38.699 --> 02:25:04.699]  absolutely yeah you know I've had hedge fund managers and venture capitalists and you know big corporations we're purchased with all sorts of deals and offers and they always come with strings but you know I'm not doing this for money Alex I'm doing this so that my children have a place where they can speak freely on the internet so that they can have the same internet that I grew up with and so that the millions of people that depend on gab to get their access to information
[02:25:04.699 --> 02:25:20.699]  if you don't have a speech you have nothing but I know you don't have the enemy attention but people you know how real this is they come to you and they say oh yeah we want to fund you do whatever you want oh here's the contract just agree to these things right like they lie up front right they see oh there's no restriction till the contract comes up
[02:25:20.699 --> 02:25:49.699]  right or even even after a lot of cases they'll do that too they'll they'll get you the money they'll get you in the door and you know then they'll try to subvert you after that but the moment you give them an inch it's over it's over the moment that you sell your soul out for for capital or you know for power or for status down for all sorts of things and when that didn't work they tried that very early on with me in 2016 2017 when we first launched gab when that didn't work that's when the attacks begin that's when they started coming after me personally coming after my family
[02:25:49.699 --> 02:26:18.699]  coming after the business you know we started getting banned from app stores and and payment processors and you name it and each and every time we just got more and more resilient and more and more bold you know if you tell me I can't do something that means that I'm going to work twice as hard to make it a reality and that's what I've been doing for five years we have plans on selling out we're fully funded just like you are you know from the people the people that are watching the show the people that are using the platform are the people that are funding gab and making gab possible
[02:26:18.699 --> 02:26:40.699]  and then what is it like spiritually and psychically to feel all these brown people and white people and black people red-blooded people you can feel their love and their will and they support you not just financially their prayers sometimes I'm so exhausted and all of a sudden it's like just they just give me all that power I'm so thankful it's that communal power this is spiritual
[02:26:40.699 --> 02:27:09.699]  you know we get letters to our P.O. box every day handwritten letters and you know we get emails and I get comments on you know hundreds of thousands of comments a week on my post with people from all around the world from all different backgrounds all different races religions beliefs and creeds saying keep going and some days you know that are tough I just needed that letter I needed to read that letter and I feel like that's that's the Holy Spirit you know working through these folks to get to me to give me that that little bit of strength that I need to be able to do that and that's what I'm trying to do.
[02:27:10.699 --> 02:27:39.699]  That little boost that I need because this is hard Alex you know I don't have to tell you this is hard on the soul it's it's hard on a man especially when you have a young family and you know what these people are capable of but you know there's something in me that that the Holy Spirit just whispers in the back of my mind and says keep going keep building you can do this and that's that's what gets me going every day is the people around us that my family have a really solid support system and the great people in the many millions of people on gab that support us.
[02:27:40.699 --> 02:28:06.699]  And it's that it's that long arc of humanity and all our ancestors behind us it is so powerful and so amazing so tell us everybody watching all these great activists they need to go to gab they need to how do they promote what you're doing they get there they post they promote it they tell folks about it I mean I can't wait for your success which is already amazing but I want to just get behind everything you're doing Andrew.
[02:28:06.699 --> 02:28:35.699]  Yeah just go to gab.com sign up create an account tell your friends and family I mean the way that we grow 100% of our growth is through word of mouth so you know we're growing you know just through people telling their friends and family so that's the best ways is get on the site stop making money for these enemy platforms allowing them to track you all across the web and siphon your data off to you know the big corporations who hate you know that's the best way you can do it is tell people about us and get on there yourself and stop using these enemy platforms.
[02:28:36.699 --> 02:29:05.699]  Spend a moment and I'm gonna let you go back to your family on this Saturday what is it like or how old were you when you first felt the Holy Spirit and then as you've done the right thing how much more intense has it gotten like what is it like for you the Holy Spirit because for me the discernment I don't make a big deal about this or get metaphysical and people are not trying to impress folks but like I like know now like we were down at the border and we didn't know where Trump was going to show up or where we'd be it didn't really matter and I sat there.
[02:29:06.699 --> 02:29:24.699]  And I sat there in a truck 30 miles away and I said get in the car now drive here Trump will be there we drove in the middle of nowhere Trump showed up exactly as I said right on time and like the crew was kind of like okay that's that's something interesting but I did not have that power 10 years ago even five years ago and I don't say that to impress people folks this is powerful.
[02:29:25.699 --> 02:29:47.699]  I mean God is powerful the Satanists are looking for power when I am purely just trying to be good I don't even know how it works it's insane it is unbelievable what the Holy Spirit is the ether it's like God's consciousness and we're like jacking into God's internet I don't know how to describe it is that what you're saying you're feeling?
[02:29:47.699 --> 02:30:13.699]  Yeah oh absolutely that's a great way to describe it I mean I was very blessed to be saved at a young age but you know like many young Christians I drifted from God you know in my teenage years and in college but thankfully you know through Gab actually I ended up getting closer and closer to God the persecution that I faced the no platforming the defaming you know having you and they had my
[02:30:13.699 --> 02:30:39.699]  saying you're a murderer saying you murdered people yeah all that stuff you know drove me closer to Christ and into the arms of Christ and you know the more that I embraced Christ and started getting more involved with my church and you know opening up the Bible and praying and you know openly proclaiming my faith the more that you know that the Holy Spirit started to you know work in me and it's really daunting Alex.
[02:30:39.699 --> 02:31:08.699]  I say to my wife the other night I said you know I really do feel like when you feel the presence of God it's it's so terrifying and so glorifying at the same time it's like it's like a bittersweet thing right it's like this is incredible but this is also incredibly terrifying right so when you when you sense the the presence of God in you and working through you it's it's it's very humbling and it brings you back down to earth and thankfully you know I have my family I have the support system.
[02:31:09.699 --> 02:31:38.699]  That I have and I have my faith to keep me grounded and keep me humble because pride cometh before the fall and that's it's very easy to be prideful in our situation right like oh we have all these these fans and all these viewers and all these these people that are on my site very easy to get a big head but I know that in an instant if God wanted to he could take that all away and that would be fine if that's what he wanted if that's what his will is I have fully submitted my life to Christ and once you do that that is what true freedom is when you fully submit to the will of God.
[02:31:38.699 --> 02:31:42.699]  That is what true freedom is on in this life and I firmly believe that.
[02:31:42.699 --> 02:32:06.699]  Exactly submission to Satan is slavery submission to God is internal empowerment it is it is just you just gotta make that and that makes me sad for my enemies because as bad as they are much as I don't like them more and more I'm like I cannot believe they don't know what God is all about and I don't know how how they're not connected to this because the deeper you get into God it's incredible.
[02:32:06.699 --> 02:32:29.699]  I mean now I don't even know how to respond to this I mean the sermon I'm giving now is like like weaponized hieroglyphs like just like everything and it's like I know now like math instantly and like all sorts of things it's like it's crazy and I'm this pathetic vessel it's not me exactly it's a charge going through me Andrew and God is with you my friend.
[02:32:29.699 --> 02:32:38.699]  God bless you again everybody should go now set up an account support others promoted they are definitely afraid of you and we love you brother.
[02:32:38.699 --> 02:32:39.699]  God bless Alex.
[02:32:39.699 --> 02:32:41.699]  All right there goes Andrew Torba.
[02:32:41.699 --> 02:32:43.699]  Gab I apologize for getting him on late.
[02:32:43.699 --> 02:32:46.699]  We had a big interview with Malice that you just saw.
[02:32:46.699 --> 02:32:48.699]  Wow that is powerful.
[02:32:48.699 --> 02:32:51.699]  It's totally real to folks I have seen.
[02:32:51.699 --> 02:33:07.699]  I mean, I told you I, I got depressed and call it that like six eight months ago, and I before I went to bed at night I got on my knees and I said God, I know you're real, and you've done so much, but I hurt, and I said, I don't want to hurt anymore.
[02:33:07.699 --> 02:33:12.699]  I don't like seeing these people that do bad.
[02:33:12.699 --> 02:33:13.699]  I said please help me.
[02:33:15.500 --> 02:33:24.620]  I had a dream that night and it wasn't a dream it was literally the golden gates it was heaven it
[02:33:24.620 --> 02:33:30.220]  was everything you'd ever heard of and it was so incredible like every spark every image everything
[02:33:30.220 --> 02:33:39.740]  I saw was so beautiful and perfect and forever and it was total completion total victory at every
[02:33:39.740 --> 02:33:46.140]  level of my very soul it was like drowning in the ocean and finally getting tossed up on shore
[02:33:46.140 --> 02:33:53.020]  and you can just rest it was just he took just rest of these arms just come here forever.
[02:33:53.210 --> 02:34:03.970]  You have free will you made the right choice now we're together forever and all the sin
[02:34:03.970 --> 02:34:11.890]  was washed away as I came out of that ocean onto that beach and I looked at it and I said
[02:34:11.890 --> 02:34:17.369]  I want to see how this works go ahead and look at anything you want and I looked into
[02:34:17.369 --> 02:34:22.449]  all of the different civilizations and groups and species were destroyed and
[02:34:22.490 --> 02:34:31.250]  God said it doesn't matter that's their free will and that's true all that
[02:34:31.250 --> 02:34:36.050]  matters is your choice now because if there is a sentient all-powerful being
[02:34:36.050 --> 02:34:39.490]  that can give you unlimited consciousness what is the one pitfall
[02:34:39.490 --> 02:34:48.690]  it's free will you can be tricked like the gay satanic orchestra or choir in
[02:34:48.690 --> 02:34:52.970]  San Francisco and you look at those people and they're just there's I had
[02:34:52.970 --> 02:34:55.970]  Michael Malice on earlier he didn't even want to talk about that because they
[02:34:55.970 --> 02:35:02.490]  were so mentally ill and I get that let's go to break let's get the next
[02:35:02.490 --> 02:35:07.490]  guest on I had him on but Thomas in Florida about their endgame the hell
[02:35:07.490 --> 02:35:11.570]  they're building for us the prison they're building for us that they say is
[02:35:11.570 --> 02:35:16.690]  Valhalla but it's the opposite of that because you don't get into Valhalla
[02:35:16.690 --> 02:35:23.610]  without fighting fighting for what's right we'll be right back stay with us
[02:35:25.410 --> 02:35:30.050]  I'm at war with tyranny but it doesn't mean that I have all the answers it
[02:35:30.050 --> 02:35:34.369]  doesn't mean that I figured out every way to defeat them but I know this if we
[02:35:34.369 --> 02:35:38.490]  reduce our signature if we take these cell phones that have all these great
[02:35:38.490 --> 02:35:42.610]  attributes and all these great services but also track trace and spy on us and
[02:35:42.610 --> 02:35:47.330]  if we lock them up in a little Faraday cage like the little Devils they are
[02:35:47.330 --> 02:35:52.410]  they can't track us they can't trace us they can't use that data against us for
[02:35:52.410 --> 02:35:58.170]  contact tracers the UN Joe Biden's people come into your doors but also
[02:35:58.170 --> 02:36:02.570]  hackers and regular criminals so what I do and I've got a black one I've got a
[02:36:02.570 --> 02:36:07.170]  red one also have it in blue I put my little devilish cell phone in it and it
[02:36:07.170 --> 02:36:11.369]  also reminds me of how powerful the phone is and how it's surveilling me and
[02:36:11.369 --> 02:36:16.570]  it makes me reduce my phone time and spend more time with my family so when
[02:36:16.570 --> 02:36:20.890]  I'm driving in a car or when I'm going to church or when I'm at the grocery
[02:36:20.890 --> 02:36:24.890]  store or when I'm not gonna use this thing or I go to bed at night I remind
[02:36:24.890 --> 02:36:29.750]  myself it's a 2x sword and I put it right inside this container now we've
[02:36:29.750 --> 02:36:33.530]  been sold out of these for months because of the supply chain breakdowns
[02:36:33.530 --> 02:36:38.530]  with the fake covered lockdowns but finally we got in some big shipments of
[02:36:38.530 --> 02:36:42.170]  these babies and so I want to encourage you to take action and get off the fence

[02:37:26.730 --> 02:37:30.690]  marketing plan for info wars I went out and found the best products I could find
[02:37:30.690 --> 02:37:34.170]  from the research defender operation I wanted you to get products that
[02:37:34.170 --> 02:37:37.930]  empowered you that you loved so you'd want to come back and buy more I treat

[02:37:45.170 --> 02:37:49.210]  bestsellers and x2 right now is discounted because listeners and viewers

[02:38:27.289 --> 02:38:32.490]  that extremely powerful interview with Andrew Torba and listen I get tears in
[02:38:32.490 --> 02:38:36.090]  my eyes the liberals make jokes about it they think it's funny that when I'm
[02:38:36.090 --> 02:38:38.770]  talking to somebody who's been persecuted and I'm talking to somebody
[02:38:38.770 --> 02:38:42.690]  reaching millions of people every day who's standing up and been through the
[02:38:42.690 --> 02:38:46.690]  crucible I admire that person I don't give a damn about football stars I don't
[02:38:46.690 --> 02:38:50.410]  care about Hollywood people I don't care about any of it I care about people that
[02:38:50.410 --> 02:38:55.330]  stand up for humanity and I'm ready to go to war for them I have gone to war
[02:38:55.330 --> 02:38:59.810]  for them and I committed everything to this and I believe in you and my
[02:38:59.810 --> 02:39:05.330]  ancestors they believed in us and so I intend to be an example to my future
[02:39:05.330 --> 02:39:09.170]  progeny we're gonna win this damn thing we're gonna have some big problems to
[02:39:09.170 --> 02:39:15.970]  fix out in the future we're gonna look back on these fights like a cakewalk but
[02:39:15.970 --> 02:39:19.970]  let it be said I believe the integrity of our species and to follow the design
[02:39:19.970 --> 02:39:25.570]  that our maker gave us and I'm following those directives sin is going
[02:39:25.570 --> 02:39:28.890]  against the directive of the Creator we have the free will to do it I've
[02:39:28.890 --> 02:39:33.850]  dabbled in plenty of it and I can just tell you right now I'm born again hard
[02:39:33.850 --> 02:39:38.610]  in the name of Jesus Christ and you're not gonna find Jesus in the churches because
[02:39:38.610 --> 02:39:42.050]  the devil puts his people in all the positions they're gonna find Jesus at 2
[02:39:42.050 --> 02:39:49.410]  a.m. praying on your knees all right that said let's bring Thomas from Florida on
[02:39:49.410 --> 02:39:54.369]  who I had on Thursday who's a smart guy and he sent us this big old stack of
[02:39:54.369 --> 02:39:59.610]  stuff he's gonna talk about the plan to get you out of your body and it's funny
[02:39:59.610 --> 02:40:07.610]  Greg Reese miss missed him on Thursday Greg Reese the Huntsman is already on
[02:40:07.610 --> 02:40:13.010]  the same track as this so that's how the zeitgeist works we're all in the
[02:40:13.010 --> 02:40:17.369]  zeitgeist the enemy has their spirit we've got ours so we're gonna talk about
[02:40:17.369 --> 02:40:25.170]  this right now with him on this Saturday global transmission so start at the
[02:40:25.170 --> 02:40:29.090]  beginning boil it down I know you told the producer the guy right on the show
[02:40:29.090 --> 02:40:34.530]  oh my god if I start talking I'll never shut up brothers okay so so so so my
[02:40:34.530 --> 02:40:40.170]  friend start with the basic premise and then lay this out for us in the next 20
[02:40:40.170 --> 02:40:45.090]  30 minutes here you got the floor thanks for joining us thank you very much for
[02:40:45.530 --> 02:40:52.490]  Mr. Jones the the essential essence of the topic is the term human digital
[02:40:52.490 --> 02:40:58.890]  twins and whether or not they can actually be separated from their
[02:40:58.890 --> 02:41:05.010]  creators so it's quite an existential question and in these very very
[02:41:05.010 --> 02:41:10.770]  challenging times it seems to be relevant because we're looking
[02:41:10.770 --> 02:41:18.610]  increasingly at why ostensibly crazy or evil things happening and what will the
[02:41:18.610 --> 02:41:25.090]  next steps be so people can be forewarned and in this situation we've
[02:41:25.090 --> 02:41:32.410]  had several governmental bodies some of them think tanks and some of them
[02:41:32.410 --> 02:41:39.050]  executive organs of groups as large as the European Union starting to use this
[02:41:39.050 --> 02:41:44.090]  phrase in the last 18 months so basically since the beginning of covered
[02:41:44.090 --> 02:41:50.330]  which may be a coincidence or people might infer otherwise about the nature
[02:41:50.330 --> 02:41:57.650]  of human digital twins and in particular whether or not they can be valuable
[02:41:57.650 --> 02:42:05.610]  after their creation and whether or not they can be traded so if we were briefly
[02:42:05.730 --> 02:42:13.530]  to consider what is a digital twin in the context of how that industrial term
[02:42:13.530 --> 02:42:23.170]  came about initially about 12 years ago in 2009 NASA adopted that term when they
[02:42:23.170 --> 02:42:29.010]  were looking for ways to describe computer assisted spacecraft design
[02:42:29.010 --> 02:42:34.250]  where they wanted to be able to simulate it against all types of conditions
[02:42:34.250 --> 02:42:38.770]  without having the entire test crew in space which obviously makes a lot of
[02:42:38.770 --> 02:42:43.970]  sentences a lot cheaper it was then very very quickly extended to an organization
[02:42:43.970 --> 02:42:52.250]  called the digital twin consortium that is a member of a rather curious group
[02:42:52.250 --> 02:42:59.289]  called the object management group we finally enough have a conference about
[02:42:59.289 --> 02:43:06.690]  space occurring in about three weeks time and for them a digital twin is a
[02:43:06.690 --> 02:43:13.970]  dynamic up-to-date representation of a physical object or system with a
[02:43:13.970 --> 02:43:22.010]  complete collection of data in one place and a digital twin evolves with the flow
[02:43:22.010 --> 02:43:28.730]  of real-time data input from sensors and other monitoring devices and this
[02:43:28.730 --> 02:43:34.250]  connection between the digital and physical worlds offers enhanced life
[02:43:34.250 --> 02:43:41.930]  cycles informed decision-making and most importantly it offers predictive
[02:43:41.930 --> 02:43:47.050]  capabilities that's right they're using us to build the AI for autonomous drones
[02:43:47.050 --> 02:43:52.410]  and beyond well it's not just autonomous drones what what this is is it is
[02:43:52.410 --> 02:43:58.170]  essentially a copy of yourself in all regards so you've had all these digital
[02:43:58.170 --> 02:44:03.410]  catchphrases that have been thrown around by people such as Thierry Britain
[02:44:03.410 --> 02:44:12.490]  the European Union Commissioner for digital services and he said a new
[02:44:12.490 --> 02:44:19.970]  digital ID will give every European citizen the keys to their digital twin
[02:44:19.970 --> 02:44:25.890]  but it's my supposition and I think there's plenty of documentation to
[02:44:25.890 --> 02:44:31.650]  support this that unfortunately your or whatever citizen you may be is not
[02:44:31.650 --> 02:44:36.369]  going to be the only person in control of a set of keys so just as if you're
[02:44:36.369 --> 02:44:43.250]  renting a house maybe the realtor and the actual building owner also have sets
[02:44:43.250 --> 02:44:46.770]  of exactly they're gonna rent your thoughts they're gonna rent Brad Pitt
[02:44:46.770 --> 02:44:54.090]  yes indeed yes indeed and so we get to a situation of how are they actually going
[02:44:54.529 --> 02:44:59.369]  to go about doing this and whether or not you think that it's far smart dust
[02:44:59.369 --> 02:45:02.490]  or whether or not you think that there was an injectable chip with the
[02:45:02.490 --> 02:45:08.330]  vaccines or whether or not there might be in the future at some point we're
[02:45:08.330 --> 02:45:16.170]  looking at a addition of your internal bodily information combined with this is
[02:45:16.170 --> 02:45:22.369]  a digital DNA being instructed off of your actions well it's it's more than
[02:45:22.529 --> 02:45:28.090]  it's all of your past history as well so the idea of the digital wallet and you
[02:45:28.090 --> 02:45:32.890]  actually discovered the tip of this iceberg when you yourself were reporting
[02:45:32.890 --> 02:45:40.090]  on homeless people being offered $100 to be chipped in Austin at the end of 2018
[02:45:40.090 --> 02:45:45.570]  you may remember that this and that program was actually called the Austin
[02:45:45.570 --> 02:45:52.690]  my pulse and that was a pilot an official pilot program of the United
[02:45:52.690 --> 02:45:59.490]  Nations ID 2020 and start over that alone is a huge story never hit the news
[02:45:59.490 --> 02:46:03.570]  even though we confirm the documents confirmed it they'll never hit that big
[02:46:03.570 --> 02:46:07.170]  stuff because that would form opposition ahead of it instead they want to just
[02:46:07.170 --> 02:46:13.330]  beta test it until it's ubiquitous well it was quite extraordinary because I
[02:46:13.650 --> 02:46:19.410]  I ended up speaking with your son by chance when I did another call in with
[02:46:19.410 --> 02:46:26.210]  Harrison Smith and I thought about this and he said do you have any
[02:46:26.210 --> 02:46:31.490]  documentation for this because as he told the story when he was younger because
[02:46:31.490 --> 02:46:36.369]  it was three years ago and he was still in high school he got a lot of flack
[02:46:36.369 --> 02:46:42.529]  from his high school classmates about not being able to document your
[02:46:42.610 --> 02:46:49.810]  ostensibly quite fantastical story and so I sent Mr. Smith and your son all of
[02:46:49.810 --> 02:46:55.330]  the documents relating to the Austin my past program the official announcements
[02:46:55.330 --> 02:47:02.130]  from the UN that Austin City was going to be a partner which came out in May of 2018
[02:47:02.690 --> 02:47:09.010]  and also an interview that was conducted at the award ceremony for the Austin
[02:47:09.010 --> 02:47:14.930]  government employee who actually received a computing and information
[02:47:14.930 --> 02:47:18.050]  technology award amazing I never even did this happen wow this is incredible
[02:47:19.090 --> 02:47:24.529]  yeah so it's complete and it wasn't just them it appeared that they were trying to do
[02:47:24.529 --> 02:47:30.850]  something in San Francisco they definitely did something in Bangladesh and they also did
[02:47:30.850 --> 02:47:36.369]  something in a refugee center in Thailand all at the same time and there were different
[02:47:36.369 --> 02:47:42.210]  rationales in each country because and by the way Klaus Schwab is on French TV saying
[02:47:42.210 --> 02:47:48.690]  the UN is going to put a microchip in well he was saying in that interview in 2016
[02:47:49.490 --> 02:47:53.570]  that initially it would be in your clothes which is what we're seeing now
[02:47:54.130 --> 02:48:04.050]  with exactly with the Amazon halo project and also the Intel make it wearable challenge
[02:48:04.210 --> 02:48:12.930]  so for the first step that he was talking about in 2016 is being done or has been done over the
[02:48:12.930 --> 02:48:18.450]  last couple of years and we're seeing it commercialized right now and then in that
[02:48:18.450 --> 02:48:24.770]  interview he said the next step was then that whatever had previously been implanted in your
[02:48:24.770 --> 02:48:32.770]  clothes would be miniaturized then could be implanted and he said specifically in your hands
[02:48:33.330 --> 02:48:39.490]  in your hand or in your head and then you would be able to make international telephone calls
[02:48:39.490 --> 02:48:49.970]  with the power of your fault so he's literally announcing revelation so we see now we've we've
[02:48:49.970 --> 02:48:56.930]  got um the um the palm pay in stores they're starting to put the new systems in to get you
[02:48:57.010 --> 02:49:04.850]  used to swiping your palm to make payments it's just like the um the touch and go system with
[02:49:04.850 --> 02:49:10.369]  the credit cards now you don't have a credit card to hold on to they say that they're going to scan
[02:49:10.369 --> 02:49:16.050]  your palm print and they claim that that's a unique identifying feature which seems
[02:49:16.050 --> 02:49:19.810]  a bit strange because you could be you know wearing a glove or you might have burnt your
[02:49:19.810 --> 02:49:22.850]  hand or you could have a cut on your hand or something of that nature that would render the
[02:49:22.850 --> 02:49:30.529]  system um not very easy to um fulfill a transaction but of course it's getting you used
[02:49:30.529 --> 02:49:37.090]  to putting your palm face down in this code reading system that obviously could either be
[02:49:37.090 --> 02:49:41.010]  looking at your fingerprints or it could be looking at your palm prints sure they're admitting all
[02:49:41.010 --> 02:49:46.850]  this so so go to the end game and then walk us through us the holy grail is getting us out of
[02:49:46.850 --> 02:49:51.330]  our bodies claiming we're going to be uploaded to a computer but in my view they really kill us
[02:49:51.330 --> 02:49:55.810]  but then the computer can mimic who you were and so that's how the fraud works and they're saying
[02:49:55.810 --> 02:50:02.369]  get out of our bodies to create a carbon neutral system well what what you had discovered was them
[02:50:02.369 --> 02:50:09.490]  building essentially the skeleton so it was your um criminal record it was your educational record
[02:50:09.490 --> 02:50:15.170]  it was a library card it was all your financial history it was all your medical history it was
[02:50:15.170 --> 02:50:19.650]  your birth certificate it was your driver's license it was your social security records
[02:50:19.650 --> 02:50:27.570]  all of that was essentially what they called the digital wallet so and and the benefit and
[02:50:27.570 --> 02:50:34.450]  the reason they were piloting it in austin and san francisco which were two cities that had very large
[02:50:34.450 --> 02:50:43.170]  homeless populations and so not only were they susceptible to a cheap financial incentive but
[02:50:43.250 --> 02:50:50.130]  in that environment as opposed to the different reasons they had in bangladesh and in thailand
[02:50:50.130 --> 02:50:54.850]  was that oh if you're homeless particularly if you have mental health problems or addiction problems
[02:50:54.850 --> 02:51:01.250]  you might literally lose your wallet and therefore if everything is on a digital backup
[02:51:01.250 --> 02:51:08.210]  it will be really convenient for you and that was how they were marketing it officially in austin
[02:51:08.210 --> 02:51:13.170]  there was a different reason in thailand it was where in a refugee camp you've had to flee with
[02:51:13.170 --> 02:51:20.529]  the clothes on your back you've lost everything in various civil wars and so um this will be very
[02:51:20.529 --> 02:51:25.890]  helpful to you because if you ever have to cross borders under emergency circumstances there'll be
[02:51:25.890 --> 02:51:31.810]  a tap into this system and find your entire history so that'd be very good for identity
[02:51:31.810 --> 02:51:37.730]  verification potentially for even illegal migrants or and thomas you're doing right just back off
[02:51:37.730 --> 02:51:46.610]  your mic a little bit so the the third scenario for bangladesh which was then also um tested in
[02:51:46.610 --> 02:51:52.770]  india and in india has been rolled out very extensively in three key databases was many
[02:51:52.770 --> 02:52:00.450]  people in those largely rural countries were being born in villages not hospitals they would
[02:52:00.450 --> 02:52:06.289]  have home births and they wouldn't get a birth certificate and that then became very probably
[02:52:06.289 --> 02:52:10.690]  problematic for them to get a bank account or to apply for university or to get a passport
[02:52:11.410 --> 02:52:17.810]  so that they had a different excuse for different types of countries and different types of social
[02:52:17.810 --> 02:52:23.730]  situations but the idea was to make it applicable to everyone and that's why they had to have a
[02:52:23.730 --> 02:52:31.650]  variety of excuses so all of that information essentially forms the skeleton but by then
[02:52:31.650 --> 02:52:42.050]  having a what they call an m e m s which was the miniaturized electromagnetic sensors there's
[02:52:42.050 --> 02:52:48.610]  an industry term for it it's a mems m e m s and people can look that up there's lots and lots of
[02:52:48.610 --> 02:52:54.930]  scientific conversation about that and they had two twin programs one of which was receiving
[02:52:54.930 --> 02:53:01.090]  financial assistance initially from the national science foundation and also obama's brain
[02:53:01.650 --> 02:53:11.010]  initiative at the um uc berkeley um university and the other one was occurring at the jacobs
[02:53:11.650 --> 02:53:18.210]  school of engineering in san diego also in california and that was being funded by the
[02:53:18.210 --> 02:53:24.690]  national science foundation and the national institutes of health and these were both to make
[02:53:25.250 --> 02:53:36.289]  um miniaturized implantable sensors that would transmit a large category of biological information
[02:53:36.289 --> 02:53:41.890]  in real time and by the way thomas again i'm going to give you the floor for the next 20 minutes
[02:53:42.610 --> 02:53:46.289]  i want you to walk through this everything you're saying you sent us the articles i've done the
[02:53:46.289 --> 02:53:50.130]  research before even came on your what you're saying is true this is so incredible i want you
[02:53:50.130 --> 02:53:56.930]  to walk through what they're doing and the whole end game of this system so if people wish to um
[02:53:56.930 --> 02:54:03.810]  look at some of these articles and verify the story for themselves one journalist who's been
[02:54:03.810 --> 02:54:11.490]  following the development of the smart dust which when you talk to many liberals they think is an
[02:54:11.490 --> 02:54:22.369]  urban myth it's like the boogie man but mr bernard marr writing for forbes magazine at forbes.com
[02:54:22.369 --> 02:54:31.170]  has actually been covering the incredible technological process and um steps in
[02:54:31.170 --> 02:54:40.690]  miniaturization and broadcasting strength that this special team of researchers at uc berkeley
[02:54:40.690 --> 02:54:49.810]  have made over the last eight years he's written articles from 2013 all the way until 2021
[02:54:50.369 --> 02:54:59.090]  and interestingly enough they were looking for investors and uh they got about 15 million
[02:54:59.090 --> 02:55:06.210]  dollars and they decided actually to form their own company for commercializing the smart dust
[02:55:06.210 --> 02:55:19.890]  and it's now called iota i o t a but even in 2018 he was writing articles about the potential
[02:55:19.890 --> 02:55:29.410]  misuse of this technology because they had got these um biosensors so small that they could be
[02:55:29.410 --> 02:55:38.289]  put into your hand like a pile of dust out of your floor cleaner and they were so light that
[02:55:38.289 --> 02:55:45.570]  you could blow them off into the air column and they would just float around and then be inhaled
[02:55:45.570 --> 02:55:51.010]  and migrate to different parts of your body and as they reached a certain temperature or a certain
[02:55:51.010 --> 02:55:56.450]  acidity level or they translated your kinetic energy into the type of electrical energy that
[02:55:56.450 --> 02:56:02.930]  they needed to function they would start broadcasting whatever parameters of data
[02:56:02.930 --> 02:56:10.690]  had been programmed into them for whatever its creators were looking to monitor you for and so
[02:56:12.130 --> 02:56:16.210]  even three years ago long before covid was officially with us
[02:56:18.289 --> 02:56:24.850]  supportive journalists were saying this is pretty scary technology and what are the actual practical
[02:56:24.850 --> 02:56:32.770]  limits to its use at exactly the same time the jacob's school of engineering had supposedly
[02:56:32.770 --> 02:56:44.850]  developed a injectable chip that was finalized in the same year and um it was the size of two
[02:56:44.850 --> 02:56:54.610]  of the letters on the um lincoln uh one penny coin and ostensibly for the national science
[02:56:54.610 --> 02:57:02.850]  foundation and the national institute of health that had been done in order that um persistent
[02:57:02.850 --> 02:57:10.690]  drink drivers so alcoholics could be monitored without the use of an in-car system that they
[02:57:10.690 --> 02:57:16.930]  felt could be um defeated so they wanted to be able to inject this into people and it was
[02:57:16.930 --> 02:57:23.890]  originally for monitoring the alcohol level continuously in your bloodstream as a probation
[02:57:23.890 --> 02:57:30.529]  condition but they then announced that they had um expanded it to a whole wide range of additional
[02:57:30.529 --> 02:57:39.570]  categories of information and they had completed dog and um monkey and pig trials and they were
[02:57:39.570 --> 02:57:47.730]  ready at that point to go into into full human trials and this was three years ago in in 2018 so
[02:57:48.690 --> 02:57:56.690]  the the most common refrain from people is they can't make chips that small and um they would be
[02:57:56.690 --> 02:58:03.730]  vulnerable to the acidity in the human body or they would be vulnerable to um you know a 40
[02:58:03.730 --> 02:58:10.930]  centigrade temperature and therefore it's not practical and so even if the concept is conceivable
[02:58:10.930 --> 02:58:18.450]  there would be insurmountable practical hurdles so both of those two technologies appear to address
[02:58:19.090 --> 02:58:26.210]  that stumbling block we then have the information that um stew peters and the frequent info wars
[02:58:26.210 --> 02:58:33.570]  contributor dr jane ruby have been bringing into the public eye along with dr sherry tenpenny
[02:58:34.050 --> 02:58:45.090]  about the um presence of graphene oxide in um some of the inoculation materials and
[02:58:46.210 --> 02:58:54.529]  it was hard to see initially how exactly graphene oxide which has a variety of industrial uses
[02:58:55.090 --> 02:59:05.650]  would relate to gathering or transmitting biological information about the inoculation
[02:59:05.650 --> 02:59:17.410]  recipients but we've now seen that there are biosensors made with a combination of graphene
[02:59:17.410 --> 02:59:27.650]  oxide and bio macromolecules enzymes such as glucose the oxidase also radish peroxidase
[02:59:28.210 --> 02:59:37.090]  lacquers and nucleic acids such as dna and rna and if viewers and listeners would like to read
[02:59:37.090 --> 02:59:44.450]  the details of that they're all detailed in article number seven that the info wars production team
[02:59:44.450 --> 02:59:51.810]  will be able to list with this broadcast and there there's a great long explanation
[02:59:51.810 --> 02:59:58.770]  for how these materials are made how they can be magnetized and how they can act
[02:59:58.770 --> 03:00:08.610]  as exceptionally small but very very sensitive information gathering devices that can broadcast
[03:00:09.170 --> 03:00:18.529]  for weeks or months at a time and don't require any kind of external battery to to keep them
[03:00:19.170 --> 03:00:24.130]  powered then there's also been a lot of conversation about people having these kind
[03:00:24.130 --> 03:00:28.690]  of like knives and forks and cell phones and trays and all kinds of things sticking to their bodies
[03:00:29.250 --> 03:00:35.570]  and the discussion there was how could they in such a small injection be getting so much
[03:00:35.570 --> 03:00:41.890]  magnetic material into your body and interestingly enough there's been an article that's just come
[03:00:41.890 --> 03:00:50.130]  out in the last few weeks which is on american databases is on the basis of research that's
[03:00:50.130 --> 03:00:57.410]  been done over the last year or two in china and it's now a process called magneto thermodynamic
[03:00:57.410 --> 03:01:05.490]  therapy and that is originally intended for cancer treatment but it's been found that they
[03:01:05.490 --> 03:01:15.650]  could increase the magnetism of the graphene oxide by blending it with iron oxide compounds fe3
[03:01:16.210 --> 03:01:25.410]  04 and also a product that comes from shrimp shells called chitosan and it would actually
[03:01:25.410 --> 03:01:35.330]  increase the magnetism whilst reducing the mass and the volume and it would also respond very very
[03:01:35.330 --> 03:01:43.410]  strongly to external electromagnetic signals so something that might be broadcast using 5g or 6g
[03:01:44.050 --> 03:01:50.289]  or some other kind of transmitter to the human body and it was found to
[03:01:50.450 --> 03:01:57.170]  generate a very strong result and last for a very long time in a human body temperature of kind of
[03:01:57.170 --> 03:02:07.170]  like 35 to 40 centigrade so even in extreme hot or cold situations it would still function in all
[03:02:07.170 --> 03:02:19.010]  those environments whilst within the human body so another frequent guest of mr jones the
[03:02:19.730 --> 03:02:29.330]  the food seller mr mike adams he recently interviewed a doctor by the name of lee merit
[03:02:30.050 --> 03:02:39.490]  and in her interview she explained how the professor of biochemistry at harvard university
[03:02:39.490 --> 03:02:48.529]  dr charles leba who was arrested by the fbi had in fact and whilst he was working for harvard
[03:02:48.529 --> 03:02:57.170]  university and the american department of defense also been working for the chinese government
[03:02:57.890 --> 03:03:05.730]  thousand talents program and had been regularly flying to um where he'd been helping them set up
[03:03:05.730 --> 03:03:13.010]  some laboratory and production facilities so what it turns out that he was working on was
[03:03:13.010 --> 03:03:24.289]  how to use graphene oxide and wrap it around nerves so that it could actually read the impulse
[03:03:24.289 --> 03:03:33.410]  data as information was being sent say from the tips of your fingers or from your corneas down
[03:03:33.410 --> 03:03:44.130]  your nerves and it was reading the information even before it got to your brain so it literally
[03:03:44.130 --> 03:03:51.330]  knew what you were doing and what the circumstances that you physically were experiencing even before
[03:03:51.330 --> 03:03:59.250]  your own brain knew that and it was externally transmitting it so i think the the issue of
[03:03:59.810 --> 03:04:03.730]  how can this possibly be done and how can all this information be gathered
[03:04:03.730 --> 03:04:13.890]  um is is dealt with fourfold on on the basis of all of that information a german magazine
[03:04:14.450 --> 03:04:23.410]  looked into what human digital twins might be in the future and they said that standalone from
[03:04:23.410 --> 03:04:30.529]  their creators they could form a network of friends and probably more complex structures
[03:04:30.529 --> 03:04:39.490]  that would involve their masters or not and they could unfriend devices so they could disconnect
[03:04:39.490 --> 03:04:47.570]  from people on facebook or on twitter they could warn you about rumors being spread and it's
[03:04:47.570 --> 03:04:54.610]  interesting to think how exactly your twin would be programmed to warn you of what might be
[03:04:54.610 --> 03:05:03.490]  classified by various government powers as being disinformation and then they would prevent other
[03:05:03.490 --> 03:05:10.369]  devices from gathering and selling your personal information they would become powerful decision
[03:05:10.369 --> 03:05:17.490]  making tools and intellectual property and they would probably become conscious at some point
[03:05:18.210 --> 03:05:25.970]  and there is a singularity what ray kurtzweil and the singularity university say is the point
[03:05:26.529 --> 03:05:35.410]  where um artificial intelligence recognizes its own existence and attempts to determine
[03:05:35.410 --> 03:05:39.970]  its own development you have to remember that when we're dealing with some of these organizations
[03:05:39.970 --> 03:05:46.930]  that have a history or a lineage from the american and the british eugenics movement
[03:05:46.930 --> 03:05:57.490]  that was precisely the starting point these people wanted for eugenics to help humanity determine
[03:05:58.050 --> 03:06:05.010]  how humankind evolved going into the future and originally that was going to be done through
[03:06:05.010 --> 03:06:12.690]  selective breeding in much the same way as the nazi party would try and match up the beautiful
[03:06:12.690 --> 03:06:21.170]  women with the ss members in order that they would generate what were in their ideal offspring
[03:06:21.890 --> 03:06:26.450]  then obviously now we don't have to have that type of breeding program because they can do gene
[03:06:26.450 --> 03:06:33.490]  editing using the software called crisper so
[03:06:36.289 --> 03:06:42.529]  we still have to think how is this actually going to have practical applications and
[03:06:44.850 --> 03:06:51.010]  lots of people will say well okay so what there's a digital twin now if you've been duplicated
[03:06:51.810 --> 03:06:59.890]  in a digital ecosystem by yourself providing a vast amount of information
[03:07:00.529 --> 03:07:08.930]  in exactly the same way that if your boss decided to hire a um it engineer to replace you from the
[03:07:08.930 --> 03:07:13.410]  subcontinent and they said you were going to give you a very generous severance package
[03:07:13.410 --> 03:07:20.450]  but you have to train your replacement otherwise you're only going to get a one week severance
[03:07:20.450 --> 03:07:27.650]  package there you are you're actually training your own replacement in the physical realm and
[03:07:27.650 --> 03:07:36.050]  here you're training your replacement in the digital ecosystem but we then have to put it
[03:07:36.050 --> 03:07:45.810]  into into practical use and ask yourselves why would they want to do this if the means are so
[03:07:46.369 --> 03:07:56.529]  expensive of gathering and storing that amount of data now if you look at the possibility of having
[03:07:56.529 --> 03:08:07.330]  a self-aware digital reproduction of a skilled human being that computer version is not going
[03:08:07.330 --> 03:08:14.130]  to need to eat they're not going to need to travel to and from work using carbon-based fuels
[03:08:14.850 --> 03:08:19.330]  they are not going to want to go on vacation they're not going to sleep and they're not
[03:08:19.330 --> 03:08:27.410]  going to vote and they're not going to complain so if you're a globalist and your overall goal
[03:08:27.410 --> 03:08:35.090]  is to massively reduce the carbon footprint of mankind then that may actually be seen
[03:08:35.090 --> 03:08:47.890]  as a very attractive means of making a lot of hungry complaining human beings redundant and
[03:08:47.890 --> 03:08:56.610]  replacing them with their digital replicas that they themselves have provided all the data to run
[03:08:57.010 --> 03:09:04.689]  the southern danish university had an interesting phrase of this they called it hrc is human
[03:09:04.689 --> 03:09:13.410]  robot collaboration and that was at a beginning stage just looking at human beings perfecting
[03:09:13.410 --> 03:09:19.890]  their interoperability with robots in factories but when you looked at the information that was
[03:09:20.850 --> 03:09:28.850]  supposedly for avoiding workplace injuries by making sure that their sphere of motions
[03:09:29.410 --> 03:09:38.529]  did not overlap so you basically wouldn't walk into a swinging robot arm the end result of this
[03:09:38.529 --> 03:09:46.529]  was a lot of human workers finding out they were indeed being replaced even more than has already
[03:09:46.529 --> 03:09:54.210]  occurred in the car manufacturing industry by by robots and this is exactly what these
[03:09:55.330 --> 03:10:03.010]  canadian folks at policy horizons wrote about in their other report which was document number 13
[03:10:03.650 --> 03:10:12.610]  called the next digital economy where the ex-strategic director of policy at the world
[03:10:12.610 --> 03:10:22.050]  economic forum wrote that most of the service sector jobs in canada could be replaced by robots
[03:10:22.050 --> 03:10:31.650]  and a very large percentage of the skilled labor workers even in the agricultural sectors
[03:10:32.290 --> 03:10:40.610]  um and in mining could also be replaced by robots and in the transition period
[03:10:41.650 --> 03:10:49.010]  between them being unemployed and supposedly miraculously them all finding new high-tech jobs
[03:10:49.810 --> 03:10:58.130]  their anger would be placated by supplying them with universal basic income and already
[03:10:58.130 --> 03:11:04.610]  in many european countries and in certain cities in the united states we see them doing trial
[03:11:04.610 --> 03:11:12.450]  projects of providing people with 500 euros or a thousand dollars a month to provide a form of
[03:11:13.170 --> 03:11:23.330]  universal basic income there's another article from 2013 forbes about smart dusk
[03:11:23.890 --> 03:11:32.290]  details about it becoming iota then explanations of how all the funding was received from the
[03:11:32.290 --> 03:11:39.890]  obama administration and the national institute of health and then some excellent work done by
[03:11:39.890 --> 03:11:46.529]  a young female investigative journalist who was based in chile but has now moved to the united
[03:11:46.529 --> 03:11:53.890]  kingdom her name is whitney webb and she has written a very detailed article called
[03:11:53.890 --> 03:12:03.490]  a leap towards humanity's destruction and it's detailing how there has been a spin-off from
[03:12:03.490 --> 03:12:13.570]  the welcome trust spelt with two l's welcome trust and they have recruited the ex-director of darpa
[03:12:13.570 --> 03:12:23.410]  darpa to now run an organization that has got a vast amount of startup capital 300 million dollars
[03:12:24.210 --> 03:12:35.650]  to try and put some of the secret projects that had been worked on both at darpa and by microsoft
[03:12:35.650 --> 03:12:45.890]  and by google into the public domain but they have some quite scary ramifications so one of
[03:12:45.890 --> 03:12:56.290]  them is the first 1000 days project to basically wire up and monitor baby's early childhood
[03:12:56.290 --> 03:13:04.850]  development to have them under total video and sensor surveillance for the first three years
[03:13:04.850 --> 03:13:12.610]  of their life as a means of trying to improve machine learning so to make machines learn
[03:13:12.610 --> 03:13:20.529]  and develop key characteristics called executive functions as human children do in their first
[03:13:20.529 --> 03:13:28.130]  three years of life then another one called multi-channel psychology and these once again
[03:13:28.130 --> 03:13:39.730]  have been run by the ex-director of darpa which is looking at how people can be motivated to work
[03:13:39.730 --> 03:13:49.410]  harder for a brain computer interface so basically some computer somewhere centrally run sending you
[03:13:49.410 --> 03:13:59.730]  signals and work harder and be happy without actually costing the the overlords anything
[03:13:59.730 --> 03:14:08.770]  extra so all of these projects are designed to be implemented by completed by 2030 that
[03:14:08.770 --> 03:14:16.210]  ubiquitous date for the 2030 agenda and the development sustainability goals of the united
[03:14:16.210 --> 03:14:25.410]  nations so the united states is fully on board with this and even this week we see in nextgov
[03:14:25.410 --> 03:14:32.290]  magazine there's a house bill that's now proposed for the u.s government to drastically modernize
[03:14:32.290 --> 03:14:38.850]  digital identities so they're a little bit behind canada and behind india believe it or not and
[03:14:38.850 --> 03:14:45.410]  behind some of the european union member states so they want to catch up with modernizing people's
[03:14:45.490 --> 03:14:57.730]  digital identity um one of the other issues that many technological um naysayers would raise
[03:14:58.290 --> 03:15:05.330]  is okay so you've got these people who have willingly taken this um chip into them is
[03:15:05.330 --> 03:15:12.450]  broadcasting this enormous amount of information over 5g how are you actually going to process
[03:15:12.450 --> 03:15:20.610]  and store all of that data which is very very good question and once again the singularity hub
[03:15:20.610 --> 03:15:28.450]  and forbes and the register magazine online provide us going back for the last five years
[03:15:28.450 --> 03:15:37.730]  at least an enormous amount of information about dna data storage and it is suggested that as far
[03:15:37.730 --> 03:15:48.290]  back as 2016 that it was possible using dna not from a person but synthetically created dna using
[03:15:48.290 --> 03:16:01.810]  the individual coding letters to download and store the entire content of the global internet
[03:16:02.689 --> 03:16:12.210]  into a device the size of a shoe box so not hundreds of thousands of feet at some national
[03:16:12.210 --> 03:16:19.090]  security agency headquarters into something the size of the shoe box which makes one wonder what
[03:16:19.090 --> 03:16:23.810]  would happen if all the information were copied they were put onto rockets and 100 of them were
[03:16:23.810 --> 03:16:32.210]  sent to every corner of the universe but in practical terms within the human digital twin
[03:16:32.210 --> 03:16:40.210]  realm in the digital ecosystems that shows the way that that volume of information can be stored in
[03:16:40.210 --> 03:16:47.890]  relatively small volumes the next question was how long will that medium last and they found that at
[03:16:47.890 --> 03:16:54.290]  room temperature they could make it last for several years if they encapsulated it and refrigerated
[03:16:54.290 --> 03:17:02.130]  it down to about minus 18 centigrade so temperature that's not too hard to achieve then their computer
[03:17:02.130 --> 03:17:11.730]  projections were that they could preserve that data for around a million years so whole civilizations
[03:17:11.730 --> 03:17:20.689]  of cycles could be preserved in this in this format and ideally even future aliens who might
[03:17:20.689 --> 03:17:25.410]  arrive at earth in a million years would be able to interpret it because it was stored not in the
[03:17:25.410 --> 03:17:33.650]  form of a hard drive or a floppy disk or a thumb drive or a cassette or a betamax video recording
[03:17:33.650 --> 03:17:40.369]  but actually in terms of the components of life and assuming that anything that arrived was alive
[03:17:40.369 --> 03:17:45.970]  it would recognize that oh this information is stored in the form of the components of life
[03:17:47.330 --> 03:17:55.410]  and there's a very good series of small video clips and other magazine articles in items number
[03:17:55.410 --> 03:18:07.090]  20, 21, 22, and 23 to verify all of that information so this is where we end up folks
[03:18:07.090 --> 03:18:14.130]  we have found that the globalists have these schemes afoot they're entirely consistent with
[03:18:14.130 --> 03:18:22.689]  their sustainable development goals they provide mechanisms to reduce the carbon footprint of
[03:18:22.689 --> 03:18:32.770]  humanity all of the information can be detected can be transmitted can be received can be stored
[03:18:33.410 --> 03:18:41.330]  and then can be processed also by either quantum computers or by dna computers to read the dna
[03:18:41.330 --> 03:18:52.930]  storage so unfortunately it makes one realize that the inoculations may be part may be part
[03:18:52.930 --> 03:19:03.570]  of a much much larger long-term scheme and the outcome for a large percentage of humanity
[03:19:04.130 --> 03:19:10.689]  is very very bad indeed because you become completely unnecessary so one has to ask
[03:19:10.689 --> 03:19:15.810]  whether or not they're just going to keep paying you universal basic income so you can watch
[03:19:15.810 --> 03:19:23.170]  netflix and go to the beach and sit on the sofa and i would suggest that that's not an outcome
[03:19:23.170 --> 03:19:30.689]  the globalists are very keen on perpetuating so i hope that everyone will have the time and the
[03:19:30.689 --> 03:19:36.770]  inclination to look at some of the data links that the infowars team is going to provide with
[03:19:36.770 --> 03:19:43.090]  this broadcast so that you can read all these articles for yourself and verify that this is
[03:19:43.090 --> 03:19:48.770]  just not some crazy science fiction theory but something that's actually happening as we speak
[03:19:48.770 --> 03:19:56.369]  ladies and gentlemen this all makes perfect sense the globalists want immortality they're trying
[03:19:56.369 --> 03:20:00.290]  to figure out how to live forever they need to get sensors on all of us and see how we act and
[03:20:00.290 --> 03:20:07.170]  behave to see if computers can actually upload what we are innately and then copy it of course
[03:20:07.170 --> 03:20:11.490]  it won't work there's a spiritual nature there's a genetic nature there's interdimensional nature
[03:20:11.570 --> 03:20:16.290]  there's all of it but they are trying to guinea pig all of us
[03:20:18.290 --> 03:20:22.529]  to figure out how to create a digital avatar a digital company
[03:20:22.700 --> 03:20:29.900]  that can live forever that's why thomas in florida has done such a great job because what he's saying
