[00:00.000 --> 00:11.180]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well

[00:18.720 --> 00:30.800]  Texas Alex Jones it is Thursday the 6th day of October 2011 we're gonna be live
[00:30.800 --> 00:37.320]  here for the next three hours and I'll be back tonight 7 to 8 p.m. for infowars
[00:37.320 --> 00:42.240]  nightly news premiering at prisonplanet.tv and infowarsnews.com then I'm
[00:42.240 --> 00:49.680]  gonna get in our bus swing it north and drive up to Dallas to occupy the grounds
[00:49.680 --> 00:57.080]  around the private number 11 branch of the private fellow reserve Luke
[00:57.080 --> 01:01.380]  Radowski was involved in the March of more than 10,000 people in Occupy Wall
[01:01.380 --> 01:06.600]  Street last night reporting for infowars.com Rob Jacobson was there as
[01:06.600 --> 01:14.880]  well traveled from Austin up there and Luke decided to try to get the diverse
[01:14.880 --> 01:18.960]  crowd of demonstrators some of them with Democratic operatives inside others in
[01:18.960 --> 01:24.040]  the Fedders and Libertarians very diverse crowd to turn towards lower
[01:24.040 --> 01:27.800]  Manhattan in the area that has the private fellow reserve at it and
[01:27.800 --> 01:32.340]  thousands reportedly did follow Luke and Luke crossed the barriers because they
[01:32.340 --> 01:35.460]  wouldn't let him get anywhere near it and the police tackle team slammed his
[01:35.460 --> 01:38.240]  head in the ground we're told and arrested him we've been trying to get a
[01:38.240 --> 01:45.000]  hold of Luke since we learned of this last night had been unsuccessful Rob
[01:45.000 --> 01:47.720]  Jacobson's been trying to get all of them since last night in this morning
[01:47.720 --> 01:51.800]  Jaren's trying to get a hold of him right now and so we will definitely get
[01:51.800 --> 01:59.160]  him on as soon as we are able to get a report from him now I would say that's
[01:59.160 --> 02:03.040]  very daring of him and a good idea in fact I tried to call Luke last night
[02:03.040 --> 02:07.980]  and to tell him hey you ought to you want to try to get a bunch of those
[02:07.980 --> 02:14.960]  protesters to actually go after the real enemy and we had our Jacobson to talk
[02:14.960 --> 02:18.200]  to him that day and Luke was like well we'll just do it Friday like Alex is
[02:18.200 --> 02:22.520]  saying but then I the decision was made because it was such a big crowd there hey
[02:22.520 --> 02:26.800]  let's turn them at the Fed instead of just hey capitalism's evil you know and
[02:26.800 --> 02:30.440]  you know Michael Moore trying to lead them down that down that primrose path
[02:30.440 --> 02:33.320]  when it's the Federal Reserve it's actually against real free market
[02:33.320 --> 02:39.640]  capitalism and once monopoly insider crony capitalism so big difference there
[02:39.640 --> 02:45.160]  and we talked with G.O. Griffin last night on the enforce nightly news about
[02:45.160 --> 02:48.680]  that and if I have time today I'm gonna air that there's also a second part of
[02:48.680 --> 02:51.760]  the interview where we went into overdrive on the show and haven't aired
[02:51.760 --> 02:55.560]  that yet and that's gonna be airing Friday I'm gonna be here Friday via Skype
[02:55.560 --> 03:00.280]  on the ground in Dallas I may even get out with a rig and walk around live that
[03:00.280 --> 03:04.080]  way at the Federal Reserve ahead of the occupation of the Federal Reserve
[03:04.080 --> 03:09.200]  officially kicking off well I was gonna say six o'clock but now I'm going up
[03:09.200 --> 03:12.720]  there tonight so we can say five to eight but if you can't get there till
[03:12.720 --> 03:16.920]  six that's fine and I'm asking folks to stay there if you believe in exposing
[03:16.920 --> 03:22.680]  the the globalist tip of the pyramid the all-seeing eye the actual head of the
[03:22.680 --> 03:26.520]  snake and then I'm gonna turn that night Friday night and drive down to
[03:26.520 --> 03:30.040]  Houston high noon for a two-hour speech and event there with folks that are
[03:30.040 --> 03:33.240]  gonna be camping out staying there and then we're gonna turn towards San
[03:33.240 --> 03:37.040]  Antonio I'm gonna be there Sunday morning 10 to noon then I'm gonna turn
[03:37.040 --> 03:42.120]  north back to Austin and do the Sunday show live here in studio 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:42.120 --> 03:46.040]  and then I'm gonna gauge things and definitely send reporters out to people
[03:46.040 --> 03:53.320]  occupying the grounds around the Fed but also I'm looking at going up there and
[03:53.320 --> 03:57.120]  joining people in broadcasting at least for a few days with people on the ground
[03:57.120 --> 04:01.880]  there now listen in the past everywhere in the country when you protest the Fed
[04:01.880 --> 04:07.080]  they don't arrest you they actually treat with kit gloves because they don't
[04:07.080 --> 04:12.360]  want to get media attention drawn to it except in one place New York they won't
[04:12.360 --> 04:16.360]  let you get anywhere near it because that's the actual head of the head that
[04:16.360 --> 04:21.480]  is the central nervous system inside the head at the New York Fed the second
[04:21.480 --> 04:26.040]  most powerful branch is arguably Kansas City or Dallas but we're we're right up
[04:26.040 --> 04:32.720]  there at the neck area going to the Dallas Fed and we're gonna be there
[04:32.720 --> 04:37.120]  peaceful with our families men women children came out last time and we're
[04:37.120 --> 04:41.440]  gonna be around the sidewalk there on public land in Dallas and if the police
[04:41.440 --> 04:47.160]  try to violate our first amendment I mean I am gonna demonstrate so they
[04:47.160 --> 04:50.000]  violate my first amendment I'll have to go to jail but I don't think that's gonna
[04:50.000 --> 04:53.760]  happen but I don't care this is the start of the second American Revolution
[04:53.760 --> 04:59.280]  against the tyrants we identify the Fed we identify the real enemy

[11:35.160 --> 11:38.560]  she ran the Dallas in the Fed that was very successful few years ago and I
[11:38.560 --> 11:43.520]  was invited up so I've invited them to invite the Occupy Wall Street people
[11:43.520 --> 11:47.040]  everybody and they've said they're gonna be coming to the event I'm kicking off
[11:47.040 --> 11:52.360]  which again will be kicked off around five to eight o'clock at night just get
[11:52.360 --> 11:55.560]  there I'm gonna then go to the next location but this is the key place try
[11:55.560 --> 11:59.280]  to focus most the energy if you can you can travel or if you're in the DFW area
[11:59.280 --> 12:03.560]  to stay there at least overnight and then others will show up they can only
[12:03.560 --> 12:07.480]  make it there Saturday and Sunday and Monday and it will it will get massive
[12:07.480 --> 12:12.600]  news attention and you can make your own decision if the cops say go away you
[12:12.600 --> 12:15.600]  don't have a First Amendment I guess you can go across the street and then see
[12:15.600 --> 12:18.200]  if they do it there but they haven't done it the last few demonstrations there
[12:18.200 --> 12:22.320]  they've actually been quite nice because they've been told to and the Dallas PD
[12:22.320 --> 12:26.560]  has lost a lot of lawsuits for arresting demonstrators in the past that are on
[12:26.560 --> 12:30.720]  the sidewalk you only need a permit if you block roads for like a parade so they
[12:30.720 --> 12:33.800]  try the hoax that you have to have a permit to demonstrate not the case do
[12:33.800 --> 12:39.160]  we have a permit when we stormed the Texas Capitol twice over the TSA no no
[12:39.160 --> 12:43.440]  they do not want to make us martyrs but if they do make us political martyrs
[12:43.440 --> 12:48.320]  and arrested arrest us so be it I'm coming to Dallas tomorrow now let's go

[12:55.200 --> 13:00.520]  the revolution against the Federal Reserve starts now
[13:00.520 --> 13:10.840]  the Federal Reserve is the branch governorship management system of the
[13:10.840 --> 13:15.520]  New World Order it is the head of the snake these are the people that have
[13:15.520 --> 13:19.280]  stolen tens of trillions of taxpayer money this is the criminal group that
[13:19.280 --> 13:23.400]  got rid of the Glass-Steagall law and allowed the mega banks to issue trillions
[13:23.400 --> 13:29.200]  of dollars of Ponzi scheme fake paper these are the people worldwide that want
[13:29.200 --> 13:33.120]  your pension funds that you've paid into these are the people that want to
[13:33.120 --> 13:39.880]  create VAT taxes and sales taxes to pay off their black hole of debts break the
[13:39.880 --> 13:44.840]  conditioning occupy the Dallas Federal Reserve it will be a focal point across
[13:44.840 --> 13:49.720]  the nation and the world spread the word and tell everyone you know even if you
[13:49.720 --> 13:54.000]  can't be there or even if you don't live near Texas that they need to be part
[13:54.000 --> 13:58.480]  of the real movement against financial tyranny and the movement that can
[13:58.480 --> 14:05.520]  restore our republic we threw off the British in 1776 resistance is victory
[14:05.520 --> 14:12.240]  and we will throw off the banksters in 2011 this is the beginning of the second
[14:12.240 --> 14:17.240]  American Revolution but this time it's gonna spread worldwide against the
[14:17.240 --> 14:24.200]  banksters and their globalist system we are going to occupy the occupiers my
[14:24.200 --> 14:31.160]  friends a great choice lies before you revolution is in the air the spirit of
[14:31.160 --> 14:38.640]  1776 is being reborn in our republic but the collectivist George Soros the
[14:38.640 --> 14:46.000]  Obamanoids the neocons are attempting to steer and manage the Occupy Wall Street
[14:46.000 --> 14:50.840]  movement we've seen Michael Moore come out and say that capitalism and free
[14:50.840 --> 14:56.280]  market and private property is the threat no my friends it is the monopoly
[14:56.280 --> 15:01.960]  capitalist the organized crime syndicate the six big megabanks Goldman Sachs
[15:01.960 --> 15:07.440]  JP Morgan Bank of America Wells Fargo and others that own the private Federal
[15:07.440 --> 15:14.480]  Reserve that hijacked this country 98 years ago in 1913 that is the enemy and
[15:14.480 --> 15:21.320]  it's time for these masqueraders to be exposed just a decade ago most Americans
[15:21.320 --> 15:25.560]  did know the Federal Reserve was private now polls show the vast majority do and
[15:25.560 --> 15:31.880]  wanted audited and abolished we are marching on the illegitimate financial
[15:31.880 --> 15:36.960]  oligarchs that seized this country and are now attempting to fully bankrupt the
[15:36.960 --> 15:43.480]  United States and Europe and establish a open financial dictatorship worldwide
[15:43.480 --> 15:49.040]  that's why I'm calling for an Occupy the private Federal Reserve movement in all
[15:49.040 --> 15:54.360]  50 states at all 12 of their major locations one of the most influential
[15:54.360 --> 15:59.400]  branches in the country arguably the second or third most powerful next to
[15:59.400 --> 16:04.760]  New York Fed is the Federal Reserve branch bank in Dallas I will be there

[16:38.080 --> 16:43.720]  San Antonio branch of the Dallas Fed mothership system the controlled
[16:43.720 --> 16:48.840]  corporate media is attempting to paint the Occupy Wall Street group as a much
[16:48.840 --> 16:53.760]  of communist and socialist and Obama supporters and the media is giving
[16:53.760 --> 16:58.240]  attention to it but only so they can co-opt it the people on the ground are

[24:33.640 --> 24:37.800]  billion dollar and five hundred million dollar handoffs to Democratic Party
[24:37.800 --> 24:43.240]  operatives fast and furious has been completely confirmed now to be a
[24:43.240 --> 24:50.200]  basically a a Iran contra it's like a tongue twister basically to be a Iran
[24:50.200 --> 24:55.240]  contra situation where guns are being shipped into drug cartels to knock out
[24:55.240 --> 25:00.040]  their competition then those pet cartels ship their drugs back into the U.S.
[25:00.040 --> 25:04.120]  Issa has come out and said you need to change your testimony and explain that
[25:04.120 --> 25:08.160]  you didn't know about it but didn't know all the details because they've now
[25:08.160 --> 25:11.240]  caught him in complete perjury and they're trying to give him a way out
[25:11.240 --> 25:18.040]  we're gonna be going over that as well today I've got a bunch of economic news
[25:18.040 --> 25:23.520]  I want to get into as well of course later I will give you my take on Steve
[25:23.520 --> 25:29.680]  Jobs death just about a month ago I shot a video and I analyzed that photo that
[25:29.680 --> 25:36.320]  TMZ got and I said it's a real photo and I had our forensic people look at it
[25:36.320 --> 25:42.520]  I'm a photographer myself and there was a son hitting him from the side so it
[25:42.520 --> 25:45.680]  looked like it was cutting into his neck like his head had been glued on but
[25:45.680 --> 25:53.360]  that was a natural distortion of the intense sunlight on his neck and it I
[25:53.360 --> 25:57.600]  matched different parts of his body with previous photos it was Steve Jobs and
[25:57.600 --> 26:04.960]  I gave him a month to live when he died a few days over a month people always
[26:04.960 --> 26:09.760]  marvel when some rich and powerful person dies what 56 years old oh how the
[26:09.760 --> 26:13.320]  mighty have fallen but I'll give you my take on Steve Jobs a little bit later
[26:13.320 --> 26:19.320]  certainly help he does rest in peace and it made his peace or as Dave Mustaine
[26:19.320 --> 26:26.040]  would say rust in peace if I guess God judges him to be a wicked globalist
[26:26.040 --> 26:30.720]  eugenics supporting devil because that is what Apple supports with Al Gore on
[26:30.720 --> 26:35.320]  their board but who am I to judge Steve Jobs we don't have enough of his public
[26:35.320 --> 26:39.440]  actions to really know if he was consciously wicked but he was a
[26:39.440 --> 26:44.400]  globalist insider and chosen by them so I'll have some things to say about Apple
[26:44.400 --> 26:48.720]  being a DARPA NSA front I've told you that for years there was actually news on
[26:48.720 --> 26:52.280]  it documents released yesterday I mentioned so we'll get back into that a
[26:52.280 --> 26:57.560]  bit also we're trying to get a hold of Luke Radowski he he got the Wall Street
[26:57.560 --> 27:01.120]  Occupy Wall Street people to break off at the end of their main march that
[27:01.120 --> 27:04.680]  George Soros people are trying to take control of and he successfully led them
[27:04.680 --> 27:08.960]  at the Federal Reserve and so they tried to cut the head off and of the
[27:08.960 --> 27:14.560]  movement and brutalized him and arrested him so great job Luke Radowski and
[27:14.560 --> 27:24.960]  another feather in his cap we also are going to be getting in to a bunch of
[27:24.960 --> 27:30.120]  news on big developments in the Middle East now before I do that I just want to
[27:30.120 --> 27:34.600]  spend a few minutes here responding to some emails I've gotten and some
[27:34.600 --> 27:38.800]  comments I've seen on the YouTube videos because I'll you know quickly scan over a
[27:38.800 --> 27:42.600]  few of those to get the feel of people and there's a frequent commenter I see
[27:42.600 --> 27:49.160]  who has the handle tall Tommy something I forget the full handle he's a
[27:49.160 --> 27:55.520]  frequent commenter and I saw him saying Alex a lot of folks are are looking
[27:55.520 --> 27:59.080]  over their shoulders at you'll be a nice doll the socialist and I'm looking at
[27:59.080 --> 28:05.200]  you sideways buddy what's going on here and I didn't really understand that
[28:05.200 --> 28:08.480]  comment because it was a G Edward Griffin interview he was commenting on
[28:08.480 --> 28:13.920]  where we were explaining that the big global mega banks want socialism for
[28:13.920 --> 28:19.040]  the grassroots to make us dependent and the whole video was against socialism
[28:19.040 --> 28:24.360]  and collectivism and communism and all its permutations and I don't like
[28:24.360 --> 28:29.320]  collectivism but I I'm not going to get into a McCarthy I type deal where
[28:29.320 --> 28:34.400]  because I have Roseanne Barr on and she tells me she's a listener and then
[28:34.400 --> 28:39.080]  makes a lot of satirical comments about redistribution of wealth I think her
[28:39.080 --> 28:43.800]  comments stand on their own and even though it's a lot of it satire I mean I
[28:43.800 --> 28:47.960]  think it it's it's pretty ridiculous but she is a listener and I'm not going to
[28:47.960 --> 28:52.280]  sit there and scream at her Ed Asner you know exposes vaccinations likes Ron
[28:52.280 --> 28:56.680]  Paul but says he thinks socialism is a great system you're going to do more
[28:56.680 --> 29:01.240]  reaching out to these people well-meaning socialist than fighting with
[29:01.240 --> 29:06.080]  them now if you're a conscious George Soros or a big mega billionaire trying
[29:06.080 --> 29:10.880]  to shut down the middle class and tax people that actually hire folks like
[29:10.880 --> 29:17.960]  musicians and doctors and scientists and inventors and everybody else or
[29:17.960 --> 29:22.280]  business owners if your wealth was gotten through the free market that is
[29:22.280 --> 29:26.080]  laudable that is that is something honored in American tradition that's
[29:26.080 --> 29:31.960]  something good if you are stealing it like the megabanks then that is bad
[29:31.960 --> 29:36.080]  they're the ones trying to re-engineer the rebellion against them into a
[29:36.080 --> 29:43.800]  collectivist mode and so to be friendly and try to bring along socialists which
[29:43.800 --> 29:48.640]  we're doing we're waking up at Asner and Roseanne Barr and people if that makes
[29:48.640 --> 29:54.080]  me a socialist so what we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones

[35:04.120 --> 35:07.160]  minders finds out that info wars has gotten in they come over and say you're
[35:07.160 --> 35:12.720]  only allowed to take five minutes now and then get out and of course having a
[35:12.720 --> 35:17.800]  huge power trip but perfect but luckily right then the speech ended of the guy
[35:17.800 --> 35:22.200]  they came to get the former one of the former top managers at Goldman Sachs
[35:22.200 --> 35:25.360]  Goldman Sachs of course the second biggest shareholder in the private
[35:25.360 --> 35:31.920]  Federal Reserve after JP Morgan Chase and he's now the head of the Nature
[35:31.920 --> 35:35.920]  Conservancy which would government grabs all this property and you know runs
[35:35.920 --> 35:38.400]  all these different operations across the country nothing to do with
[35:38.400 --> 35:42.240]  environmentalism here's this Goldman Sachs guy heading it up and he agrees to
[35:42.240 --> 35:46.040]  an interview and then Darren McBrain our reporter we're going to show this
[35:46.040 --> 35:52.200]  tonight says okay we're gonna which I would have just started going to the
[35:52.200 --> 35:55.880]  questions but Darren did you know did a great job but I like to ask us softball
[35:55.880 --> 35:59.520]  linking into the hard ones McBrain goes ahead and prefaces well this is going to
[35:59.520 --> 36:03.720]  kind of be from the supporters of coal position or proponents and as a car and
[36:03.720 --> 36:07.920]  he goes President Obama said that he wanted to bankrupt the coal industry in
[36:07.920 --> 36:12.600]  the campaign and the guy goes whoa whoa whoa whoa turn your camera off and I
[36:12.600 --> 36:15.040]  guess I've done that before too when somebody says that it's kind of
[36:15.040 --> 36:19.240]  instinctive John kind of hit the button turned it off but then turn it back on
[36:19.240 --> 36:22.040]  a minute later and the guy's waving his arms you know you can't show this and
[36:22.040 --> 36:25.280]  all this stuff really we're let into an event you give a speech and you say
[36:25.280 --> 36:28.080]  I'll do an interview and you say you won't do it that's like 60 minutes people
[36:28.080 --> 36:32.400]  say I'm not doing this interview we're news we're not entertainment we go to an
[36:32.400 --> 36:36.880]  event you agree to speak we'll show it we're gonna show it tonight news first
[36:36.880 --> 36:40.480]  amendment pal it's not like we're asking to be in some Nickelodeon special and
[36:40.480 --> 36:46.080]  it's entertainment the news doesn't ask you to sign forms the point is is that
[36:46.080 --> 36:52.200]  he runs like a roach he gets all up there with his glad handing and McBrain
[36:52.200 --> 36:59.520]  goes okay first question Obama said he wants to bankrupt coal and then McBrain
[36:59.520 --> 37:05.120]  kind of chases him down the hall nicely saying to him hey what about General
[37:05.120 --> 37:07.520]  Electric getting waivers you know they're not getting shut down but the
[37:07.520 --> 37:12.400]  other plants are I mean there were two plants in Illinois shut down Tuesday
[37:12.400 --> 37:19.240]  there were more plants shut down in California and Tennessee yesterday I
[37:19.240 --> 37:22.640]  haven't searched today to see what's been shut down I mean they're shutting
[37:22.640 --> 37:30.000]  the power down the head of the energy department in February told the Wall
[37:30.000 --> 37:35.520]  Street Journal we showed yesterday he said we are going to shut down massive
[37:35.520 --> 37:39.360]  numbers and he talked about over a thousand plants see under the free
[37:39.360 --> 37:42.640]  market they built thousands and thousands of coal plants cities owned
[37:42.640 --> 37:46.200]  them counties little communities got together and built little coal fired
[37:46.200 --> 37:50.400]  plants for the community or hydroelectric whatever the case is that's
[37:50.400 --> 37:54.760]  all bought up they come in they buy off your city council they shut down your
[37:54.760 --> 37:58.800]  local power plants they've shut down a couple that Austin had great plants they
[37:58.800 --> 38:01.440]  use useful idiots to go out and you know demonstrate and so they want to shut
[38:01.440 --> 38:04.440]  down and I don't know depending on the numbers you look depending on where you
[38:04.440 --> 38:09.080]  are in Austin it's a 30 40% increase the last five six years in some areas of
[38:09.080 --> 38:14.920]  Dublin now Austin energy says 60% increase for some people but if you're
[38:14.920 --> 38:18.360]  not a peak user only you know moderate increases and I showed you that yesterday
[38:18.360 --> 38:22.960]  we're going to our guest but the point is it's Goldman Sachs it's JP Morgan Rick
[38:22.960 --> 38:27.480]  Perry went to Bilderberg in 2007 to discuss how to shut down Texas power
[38:27.480 --> 38:31.040]  plants with these guys and a big foreign company came in and is allowed to
[38:31.040 --> 38:37.440]  build them so they shut down other plants build new ones shut down basically
[38:37.440 --> 38:41.200]  other new ones put new regulations on other companies that aren't part of the
[38:41.200 --> 38:45.720]  inside group and your power bill goes up and I get emails from idiots saying you
[38:45.720 --> 38:51.600]  must work for coal no I work for the old lady in East Austin who's on social
[38:51.600 --> 38:56.880]  security with her with her cola frozen or cost of living expense frozen who's
[38:56.880 --> 39:03.600]  going bankrupt I work for my grandmother who lives in a working class area
[39:03.600 --> 39:10.640]  South Austin and who can't live on social security and is exhausted all over
[39:10.640 --> 39:17.280]  savings and who the family helps out who just can't believe her power bill goes
[39:17.280 --> 39:20.960]  up and up and up in the summer I go over there and it's 110 degrees inside the
[39:20.960 --> 39:24.840]  house with the windows open as it gets to 110 degrees here and I've got to give
[39:24.840 --> 39:30.120]  her money and say you will turn on the air conditioner you will turn it on you
[39:30.120 --> 39:36.160]  will turn on the heat you will hear some money because I've got to give again I
[39:36.160 --> 39:39.360]  love giving my grandmother money the point is it's being sucked out by these
[39:39.360 --> 39:43.240]  slime bags who come in here and I got to watch some Goldman Sachs guy literally
[39:43.240 --> 39:49.240]  literally strut up to the podium and sit there and go I know Goldman Sachs
[39:49.240 --> 39:54.600]  isn't very popular now but we got a plan to help the earth and shut down coal you
[39:54.600 --> 39:58.520]  know and with clean ones we've got an initiative with a world without coal you
[39:58.520 --> 40:01.800]  walk over to the vampire and you go see this holy cross here and the guy's like
[40:01.800 --> 40:07.960]  ah I mean literally running like a bat out of hell
[40:09.120 --> 40:13.120]  yeah the president said he wants to bankrupt coal oh no I'm not doing this
[40:13.120 --> 40:19.960]  I'm not talking about yeah turn the camera can't use this that's who we're
[40:19.960 --> 40:24.800]  talking about that's who runs the Federal Reserve okay and it's time for them to
[40:24.800 --> 40:28.480]  stop ten years ago five years ago they go to Congress everybody would bow down
[40:28.480 --> 40:35.440]  senators voices would shake mr. Greenspan oh so good I mean I I mean I used
[40:35.440 --> 40:44.280]  to play clubs of it on there I was like sir I mean it was like they were God like
[40:44.280 --> 40:48.480]  God like Zeus had been down into the chamber now they're yelling at them
[40:48.480 --> 40:52.800]  they're calling them liars where's the money that fruitcake Bernanke squirming
[40:52.800 --> 40:56.800]  around like the snake he is we are going to pull them down politically we are
[40:56.800 --> 41:00.840]  going to muddy them with their own a fluvial leaveings that they've dumped
[41:00.840 --> 41:05.480]  on us we are going to pillory them with their with their actions and we are
[41:05.480 --> 41:09.200]  going to encircle them and chant them and let everybody know that they are the
[41:09.200 --> 41:14.040]  enemy and the author of our ruin and you know it's very dangerous for me to do
[41:14.040 --> 41:18.040]  this individually but I don't care I'm like a kamikaze going straight into them
[41:18.040 --> 41:23.080]  they are the enemy of the Republic they're the ones that launch the wars
[41:23.080 --> 41:25.760]  they're the ones that are taking our liberties they're the ones that lobby
[41:25.760 --> 41:29.640]  for all the environmental land grabbing and we've got a lady on with us Debbie
[41:29.640 --> 41:33.520]  McKee who I appreciate holding while I pull that story that will air tonight
[41:33.520 --> 41:38.080]  Debbie McKee started I guess back in 2008 the in the Fed up in Dallas very
[41:38.080 --> 41:42.560]  successful we've got video in our press release of of that event and other
[41:42.560 --> 41:49.400]  events and you can find out more at endthefedusa.ning.com and Debbie
[41:49.400 --> 41:53.860]  McKee joins us and she's going to be bringing her great organization the
[41:53.860 --> 41:58.680]  Dallas in the Fed out to join us this Friday so good to have you on with us
[41:58.680 --> 42:04.680]  Debbie and there's a photo of you on screen with the wonderful Ron Paul so
[42:04.680 --> 42:08.160]  so tell us about yourself in the Fed why you're doing this and what do you think
[42:08.160 --> 42:12.200]  of my idea of instead of just letting Michael Moore tell us capitalism's the
[42:12.200 --> 42:17.200]  problem actually going to the real source I think that's what we have to do
[42:17.200 --> 42:22.720]  I got involved after Ron Paul's campaign last time and we're just we're just
[42:22.720 --> 42:27.320]  trying to reach anybody who will listen you know keep party people the
[42:27.320 --> 42:33.800]  Democrats whatever these people out today for Occupy Dallas we have flyers we
[42:33.800 --> 42:37.720]  just want to reach people who know that something's wrong and point them in the
[42:37.720 --> 42:42.600]  right direction as far as you know where the root cause of the problem is isn't
[42:42.600 --> 42:48.160]  it encouraging that the end the Fed people will the Occupy Wall Street
[42:48.160 --> 42:52.200]  people in Dallas the Occupy Dallas group is going to the Fed so people are
[42:52.200 --> 42:56.920]  starting to get it and then last night Occupy Wall Street group marched on the
[42:56.920 --> 43:01.280]  Fed and there were arrests so so finally I mean did you see Bernanke go I
[43:01.280 --> 43:05.560]  understand why people are mad at Wall Street and capitalism yesterday see he
[43:05.560 --> 43:10.400]  loves that nebulous thing and George Soros says he's with the Occupy Wall
[43:10.400 --> 43:14.520]  Street Soros would love to occupy the firms he doesn't control on Wall Street
[43:14.520 --> 43:22.200]  and take them over like they did Bear Stearns how many folks do you think the
[43:22.200 --> 43:26.040]  Dallas in the Fed folks that you had up are gonna be able to bring out to this
[43:26.040 --> 43:30.160]  rally that we're launching Friday evening I have no idea it was kind of
[43:30.160 --> 43:34.160]  short notice but I think with you're getting the word out on your show we
[43:34.160 --> 43:39.440]  could have a really good turnout today we didn't have very many but there were
[43:39.440 --> 43:44.760]  hundreds of those Occupy Dallas people here so it was kind of exciting okay so
[43:44.760 --> 43:49.080]  that that march is already going on what's what's happening in Dallas well
[43:49.080 --> 43:52.440]  they marched down we were at the Fed building before nine because I said
[43:52.440 --> 43:55.960]  they'll be there from like nine to twelve so we were there before nine and they
[43:55.960 --> 44:00.400]  met at a park several blocks away and they marched down towards us and the
[44:00.400 --> 44:05.760]  police said they had about 300 but I think they probably had maybe maybe 500
[44:05.760 --> 44:09.640]  and they stood around with us on the corner for a while and you could tell
[44:09.640 --> 44:12.520]  they were getting hot and bored in the sun and they wanted to go march on
[44:12.520 --> 44:16.320]  Chase Bank which is across the street so we could hear people saying let's go
[44:16.320 --> 44:20.120]  march on Chase and other people saying that's not in the plan route you
[44:20.120 --> 44:24.200]  know like they didn't want to deviate from the plan and they ended up when we
[44:24.200 --> 44:27.320]  were trying to leave to get back to my car and take this phone call they were
[44:27.320 --> 44:33.000]  marching past the Fed up a block and then across the street and down towards
[44:33.000 --> 44:39.480]  Chase so the Dallas police were you know flexing with the movement and allowing
[44:39.480 --> 44:44.280]  them more freedom and access hey I think that's a great idea perhaps I should
[44:44.280 --> 44:51.640]  drop by at four to five tomorrow and I'll bullhorn the Chase people which
[44:51.640 --> 44:56.840]  again are owners of shareholders of the evil Fed across the street
[44:56.840 --> 45:03.200]  they're they're they're they're fake quasi private organization over there and
[45:03.200 --> 45:09.120]  then I guess five to eight or so we'll try to get folks out there at the well
[45:09.120 --> 45:12.680]  we're gonna get a lot out there at the Dallas Federal Reserve now now now I'm
[45:12.680 --> 45:17.240]  asking people Debbie because I'm gonna go on to the Houston Fed and the San
[45:17.240 --> 45:21.000]  Antonio Fed but then I'll send reporters back or I'll come back myself I'm asking
[45:21.000 --> 45:24.040]  people to go ahead and camp out there because that's gonna get the real
[45:24.040 --> 45:27.080]  attention there on the sidewalk and that's encouraging you're saying the
[45:27.080 --> 45:30.320]  police didn't try to violate your first amendment today when you were out there
[45:30.320 --> 45:34.000]  you said with hundreds of people that showed up from occupied Alice no they
[45:34.000 --> 45:37.480]  really were being pretty good I think we have a really good relationship with
[45:37.480 --> 45:41.320]  them that's why I wanted to be here early to be like the first one there on
[45:41.320 --> 45:45.680]  the scene and the Dallas police has worked with us you know since 2008 or
[45:45.680 --> 45:49.720]  we've had rallies two or three times a year and they've been very good we have
[45:49.720 --> 45:55.400]  a good yeah there was a black detective he gave me his card I forgot his name
[45:55.400 --> 45:59.360]  he's on the videos but when no cameras were around last time he said listen I
[45:59.360 --> 46:03.120]  know about the Federal Reserve okay we're your friends I got it and he was
[46:03.120 --> 46:09.000]  like I appreciate you so the cops up there were very nice last time unlike the
[46:09.000 --> 46:14.000]  New York police but so it's a good place to encircle the Fed and get media
[46:14.000 --> 46:17.520]  attention people are like why do we do this we point out it's the Federal
[46:17.520 --> 46:20.760]  Reserve Debbie why do you think we should protest the Fed instead of just
[46:20.760 --> 46:25.160]  saying you know capitalism's evil well because they're really behind it and
[46:25.160 --> 46:30.400]  it's not capitalism it's fascism you know or corporatism yep so they're
[46:30.400 --> 46:33.840]  really the root but you know I pointed out to people today I talked to there
[46:33.840 --> 46:37.720]  they're just the root that we can see it's really the people behind them that
[46:37.720 --> 46:44.560]  we can't see so I had flyers with some good info and told everybody hey thanks
[46:44.560 --> 46:53.400]  for coming we've been here since 2008 we're glad you joined us what's your
[46:53.400 --> 46:56.960]  analysis just from having a chance to march with them and watch them of the
[46:56.960 --> 47:00.680]  400 500 or so you said the police at 300 but it was more they always try to
[47:00.680 --> 47:06.440]  underestimate just be on the safe side of the occupied Dallas folks I mean from
[47:06.440 --> 47:10.960]  when I've heard they're a pretty diverse group oh yeah Mary there was every
[47:10.960 --> 47:15.440]  everybody you could imagine was there from the older grandma who was just
[47:15.440 --> 47:21.200]  tired of you know the economy so that kids you don't have any job to most of
[47:21.200 --> 47:26.600]  a lot of students were there there were it was a wide range of nationalities and
[47:26.600 --> 47:32.800]  and colors and it was just it was a good diverse group lots of good signs there
[47:32.800 --> 47:39.400]  were lots of thought for those things fine well it's very exciting did you I
[47:39.400 --> 47:42.480]  mean obviously you were there to let them know hey tomorrow night's important
[47:42.480 --> 47:46.200]  believe me that's the one that's gonna get the media attention Dallas Morning
[47:46.200 --> 47:50.560]  News has covered it NBC News and Dallas has covered it D magazine has covered it
[47:50.560 --> 47:53.880]  this morning I couldn't even go through all the publications that are already
[47:53.880 --> 47:59.480]  covering it was there any media there today oh they were I mean very very
[47:59.480 --> 48:03.480]  thick there was a lot of media there today and and they're saying they're
[48:03.480 --> 48:11.640]  gonna be there tomorrow correct I don't know well I really have no idea well
[48:11.640 --> 48:14.640]  there's gonna be a huge there's gonna be a huge turnout tomorrow I would
[48:14.640 --> 48:17.520]  imagine will be a lot bigger than the occupied Dallas folks but they are
[48:17.520 --> 48:21.000]  certainly invited we're the occupied Dallas folks and they were gonna come
[48:21.000 --> 48:25.200]  out tomorrow night it sounds like they're planning to be here tomorrow too so I
[48:25.200 --> 48:31.320]  guess they will well that is that is extremely extremely exciting and I
[48:31.320 --> 48:35.560]  obviously will give a speech and indict the Fed myself but then I'll try to hand
[48:35.560 --> 48:39.440]  off the bullhorn or let you guys go on your own bullhorn so I don't destroy my
[48:39.440 --> 48:44.000]  voice my days of screaming at the top of my lungs in the bullhorn have
[48:44.000 --> 48:47.720]  got to end I haven't been to the doctor but I can tell you from years of
[48:47.720 --> 48:52.800]  screaming I've gotten this husky voice and that I've got to just now speak at
[48:52.800 --> 48:57.840]  rallies and not scream until I cough blood up so I will be there and speak
[48:57.840 --> 49:01.440]  for off and on for two hours I look forward to hearing you speak and other
[49:01.440 --> 49:05.960]  speak and just God bless you Debbie McKee any other points you'd like to make
[49:05.960 --> 49:11.920]  well I just like to encourage everybody to you know work together on this and
[49:11.920 --> 49:15.480]  reach out to people who they may not be exactly like minded but we need to work
[49:15.480 --> 49:23.360]  together against the power elite so that's my main point work together work
[49:23.360 --> 49:27.600]  together against the power elite absolutely what do you think of their
[49:27.600 --> 49:31.240]  attempt because I've got reporters all over the country their attempt to try to
[49:31.240 --> 49:35.400]  turn this into a democratic thing but we've been on the street these are not
[49:35.400 --> 49:39.440]  democratic operatives the media is trying to act like they speak for George
[49:39.440 --> 49:44.040]  Soros but they don't yeah well if you just look at the basic overall look you
[49:44.040 --> 49:48.600]  would probably get that idea and you know the media is kind of pinpoint who
[49:48.600 --> 49:52.280]  they want to they're going to interview who they want to so you know they can
[49:52.280 --> 49:58.160]  portray that but I think it was pretty diverse really well when we had that in
[49:58.160 --> 50:02.080]  the Fed rally one of many you've had that I was at 2008 and in November out
[50:02.080 --> 50:06.000]  there it was about as diverse as it gets white folks old folks young folks
[50:06.000 --> 50:10.280]  Hispanics Asians black folks it was great all burning with the light of
[50:10.280 --> 50:14.560]  liberty in their eyes all had the same spirit
[50:15.320 --> 50:19.800]  that appreciate everything you do well we appreciate you Debbie and I look

[50:33.880 --> 50:37.520]  any trouble which of that same detectives out there we should know and
[50:37.520 --> 50:41.760]  get him in trouble a lot of shut up but the point is we're going to be right

[54:25.800 --> 54:30.800]  video bookstore shopping cart at info wars.com.
[54:30.800 --> 54:32.800]  Things like this new flag.
[54:32.800 --> 54:37.800]  Now we're getting custom made info wars, made in America babies, but they're going to cost
[54:37.800 --> 54:39.800]  us like 10 bucks a piece or so.
[54:39.800 --> 54:42.800]  We'll have to charge like 20 bucks or 25 bucks on those.
[54:42.800 --> 54:47.800]  This baby we get really inexpensively so we can sell these for 10 bucks.
[54:47.800 --> 54:51.800]  And it is a don't tread on me Gadsden flag.
[54:51.800 --> 54:55.800]  It's great to fly at your house.
[54:55.800 --> 54:57.800]  Great to have in your house.
[54:57.800 --> 55:03.800]  It's a good conversation piece for people available at info wars.com.
[55:03.800 --> 55:06.800]  People keep requesting flags.
[55:06.800 --> 55:09.800]  You've heard them on air so we aim to please.
[55:09.800 --> 55:11.800]  There you go.
[55:11.800 --> 55:12.800]  There you go.
[55:12.800 --> 55:14.800]  You want Gadsden flags and more?
[55:14.800 --> 55:17.800]  We are developing them and getting them.
[55:17.800 --> 55:21.800]  Also we have the propure water filter.
[55:21.800 --> 55:26.800]  The next generation of gravity fed filters blows leading competition out of the water pun intended.
[55:26.800 --> 55:30.800]  You can go see a side by side comparison at info wars.com.
[55:30.800 --> 55:35.800]  Super high quality gravity fed filtration system stainless steel spickets.
[55:35.800 --> 55:37.800]  Not just the container.
[55:37.800 --> 55:40.800]  Check it all out at info wars.com.
[55:40.800 --> 55:44.800]  And your purchase also finances the burgeoning info war.
[55:44.800 --> 55:51.800]  We are trying to plow more and more of the capital that's coming in here.
[55:51.800 --> 55:57.800]  And exhausting many of our reserves in the attempt to really maximize the amount of people we're reaching.
[55:57.800 --> 56:04.800]  That when you buy a book or a DVD or a info wars.com t-shirt you support this transmission.
[56:04.800 --> 56:10.800]  Plus you get a tool whether it's the t-shirt or a video or book that will wake up others.
[56:10.800 --> 56:14.800]  And also in the case of a book or video inform you to a higher level.
[56:14.800 --> 56:18.800]  And all over the country now when I travel I see info wars.com stickers.
[56:18.800 --> 56:20.800]  Some of them that didn't come from us.
[56:20.800 --> 56:22.800]  People I guess are making them custom. That's great.
[56:22.800 --> 56:28.800]  Oh by the way I almost forgot we got some new bumper stickers in because you requested them.
[56:28.800 --> 56:36.800]  Most of the stuff we end up doing now in the flyer department is Listern requested fluoride.
[56:36.800 --> 56:40.800]  There is poison in the tap water info wars.com.
[56:40.800 --> 56:48.800]  It would be great to have these put up all over the place in legal lawful areas in public to make people talk.
[56:48.800 --> 56:55.800]  By the way one of the big counties of Pinellas County in Florida with 700,000 people just removed fluoride.
[56:55.800 --> 56:59.800]  Every day now I'm seeing big towns, major cities, major counties.
[56:59.800 --> 57:01.800]  I mean we're having victory here.
[57:01.800 --> 57:05.800]  And a lot of times it happens because people put up fluorides poison signs.
[57:05.800 --> 57:08.800]  When we had that flyer contest everybody put flyers up.
[57:08.800 --> 57:11.800]  Boy the government and water districts would get hopping mad.
[57:11.800 --> 57:18.800]  But in a bunch of cases it then spurred discussions that led to it being pulled out.
[57:18.800 --> 57:21.800]  Because under the name fluoride they put hundreds of deadly chemicals in.
[57:21.800 --> 57:24.800]  So these are thrown in all of the orders.
[57:24.800 --> 57:29.800]  When you order DVDs, books, you get a free citizen rulebook, Constitution Bill of Rights, all that great stuff.
[57:29.800 --> 57:32.800]  Famous founding father quotes during nullification.
[57:32.800 --> 57:35.800]  And then you also get a mix of different bumper stickers thrown in.
[57:35.800 --> 57:38.800]  Or you can buy these in bulk at info wars.com.
[57:38.800 --> 57:41.800]  Fluoride, there is poison in the tap water.
[57:41.800 --> 57:46.800]  By the way I mentioned this on Monday but I've spent really no time on it.
[57:46.800 --> 57:51.800]  Sometimes stuff such old news to us that finally when it becomes mainstream news I don't cover it.
[57:51.800 --> 57:53.800]  I have a lot of blind spots.
[57:53.800 --> 57:59.800]  And listeners have commented and said why aren't you covering Bank of America and the $5 fee?
[57:59.800 --> 58:04.800]  Well because they said a year ago they had a big bank consortium meeting and they said they're going to start raising prices.
[58:04.800 --> 58:07.800]  They're going to start charging you to keep money in the bank.
[58:07.800 --> 58:09.800]  Switzerland's already begun that.
[58:09.800 --> 58:11.800]  Because the money's that worthless.
[58:11.800 --> 58:13.800]  The banks have been given unlimited trillions.
[58:13.800 --> 58:15.800]  So they don't need your business anymore.
[58:15.800 --> 58:21.800]  They don't even need it to take $1 you deposit and loan out 10 under the old fractional reserve banking system.
[58:21.800 --> 58:25.800]  They've left that entirely to just pure total made up money.
[58:25.800 --> 58:27.800]  I'm going to explain that coming up.
[58:27.800 --> 58:29.800]  And we've got George Norrie coming up.
[58:29.800 --> 58:32.800]  Well we've got a jam packed broadcast here.
[58:32.800 --> 58:33.800]  Wow.
[58:33.800 --> 58:35.800]  Here's the number to call in.
[58:35.800 --> 58:38.800]  800-259-9231.
[58:42.800 --> 58:46.800]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:50.800 --> 58:54.800]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[58:54.800 --> 58:58.800]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[58:58.800 --> 59:03.800]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[59:03.800 --> 59:07.800]  We've turned a tremendous influence on our president and Congress.
[59:07.800 --> 59:09.800]  And they really are calling the shots.
[59:09.800 --> 59:14.800]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[59:14.800 --> 59:17.800]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[59:17.800 --> 59:22.800]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty.
[59:22.800 --> 59:24.800]  And on its ashes constructing world government.
[59:24.800 --> 59:27.800]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[59:27.800 --> 59:28.800]  They're asking for more matches.
[59:28.800 --> 59:31.800]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[59:31.800 --> 59:33.800]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[59:33.800 --> 59:38.800]  And right now in Washington DC, we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[59:38.800 --> 59:43.800]  Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[59:43.800 --> 59:52.800]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.

[59:55.800 --> 59:58.800]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:05.800]  Big Brother.
[01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:07.800]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:09.800]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:10.800]  You want answers?
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:12.800]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:16.800]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:22.800]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:27.800]  I'm really proud of infowars.com yet again.
[01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:30.800]  It was over the weekend that Curt Nemo wrote about it.
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.800]  And I saw other alternative media had it as well.
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:34.800]  Forget our headline.
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:37.800]  Perhaps I can run back there and ask Nemo.
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:39.800]  He's in the office right now.
[01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:47.800]  It was something like a secret group puts Americans on kill list.
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:48.800]  Here's Reuters today.
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:50.800]  This just broke today.
[01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:52.800]  They'll probably get the Pulitzer Prize for it.
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:56.800]  Secret panel can put Americans on kill list.
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:58.800]  And we're all a-locky.
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:00:59.800]  That's the stage death.
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:02.800]  They've killed a guy like five, six times.
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:05.800]  Well, I guess we reported on that last week too, the kill list.
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:06.800]  So there you have it.
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:08.800]  Reuters is now breaking it.
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:12.800]  Search infowars.com had it, I don't know, four or five days ago.
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:15.800]  But search infowars.
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:18.800]  Just type in infowars.com into the Google NSA system.
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:22.800]  And then type in secret panel.
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:24.800]  Secret government group puts Americans on kill list.
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:26.800]  Something like that, infowars.com.
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:30.800]  I just want to not even toot our horn and say, look, we scooped Reuters.
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:32.800]  I want to, and it was on some other sites too.
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:35.800]  It wasn't like, it's just incredible.
[01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:39.800]  Of course, came out there were these kill list panels years ago under Bush too.
[01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:41.800]  But here it is from Reuters.
[01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:44.800]  Secret panel can put Americans on kill list.
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:47.800]  I'm going to be talking more about that.
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:52.800]  We've got Danny Pan Zella joining us just for a few minutes coming up.
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:55.800]  But also want to get him on the TV show as well.
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:02:00.800]  Because he's an example of what one person can do, one man, one woman.
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:06.800]  What you can do by standing up, one man in the right can, you know, reverse the whole course of history.
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:08.800]  One woman in the right.
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:15.800]  What's the Texas Rangers saying by the founder of the Texas Rangers?
[01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:19.800]  A man in the wrong can't stand up against a man in the right.
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:24.800]  If the man in the right keeps on coming.
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:27.800]  A lot of people ask why they haven't killed me yet.
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:31.800]  And they've done some dirty tricks and things and I don't really like to think about it or make a big deal out of it.
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:33.800]  I see that as a sound of my success.
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:39.800]  And they try to kill my name and the media and demonize me and they've got whisper campaigns out against me.
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:46.800]  And they use the Cass Sunstein model of posing as patriots or conspiracy theorist alternative media and attack me 24 seven.
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:48.800]  I mean, these are people on the job.
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:50.800]  Every one of our YouTube videos.
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:57.800]  As they go live within seconds, there's five, six, seven, eight negative votes within seconds there.
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:03.800]  There are whole teams of people with dummy cut out accounts waiting, waiting.
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:09.800]  And as soon as it goes live, boom, the negatives go up and then they're always trying to skew it.
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:10.800]  It's but it fails.
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:14.800]  They're trying to create some psychological warfare thing where people look at how they voted.
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:18.800]  And I guess that works with some people's sites and then they'll vote against me.
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:22.800]  But we usually have about 97 98% positive.
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:28.800]  After a few minutes, the positive votes outweigh the negative and then it beats them from there.
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:35.800]  But Dave was the one that pointed this out to me about six months ago as he goes, Alex, within seconds of it going live.
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:39.800]  There are people in there voting it down and that doesn't continue.
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:44.800]  Then as people actually watch it, real people, he doesn't know that spam bots doing it.
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:46.800]  They admit they have the Pentagon doing it.
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:52.800]  But they're doing that to try to keep it off the front page of YouTube and they crawl through everything and file fake things.
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:58.800]  And we just file against it and keep the side up because that particular sites reached 146 million people the last few years.
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:01.800]  And you count the other YouTube's sites and auxiliary sites.
[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:02.800]  It's over 300 million.
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:03.800]  I haven't counted up in a while.
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:09.800]  300 million views in the last two and a half, three years or so just on YouTube alone.
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:12.800]  You think you think the system likes 300 million views?
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:17.800]  Think they like 30 something million Obama deception watched?
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:19.800]  No, no, no.
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:23.800]  The system doesn't like it at all.
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:27.800]  And you know what will happen if they kill me or set me up?
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:30.800]  They could make up anything in the world about yours truly.
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:34.800]  Nobody's going to believe it because they know what liars the system is.
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:36.800]  It's like when they attack Rand Paul, it didn't work.
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:37.800]  Or Ron Paul.
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:42.800]  They could kill me and all we'll do is empower all the messages I put out.
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:44.800]  I mean, I've said a lot of stuff.
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:45.800]  I've covered a lot of issues.
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:51.800]  And if they killed me, that would really, really turn me into a martyr.
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:55.800]  Now, I intend on doing a lot more damage as not being a martyr.
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:57.800]  Continue to move forward with the information.
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:58.800]  Either way, we win.
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:01.800]  Hi, folks.
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:02.800]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:07.800]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity and recognized risk.
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:09.800]  Saving means to make money.

[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:26.800]  perfumes, deodorants or antibacterials.
[01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:29.800]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents
[01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:34.800]  that give you rashes, itching sores and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:37.800]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before,
[01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:39.800]  you've had to do something you've never done before.

[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:24.800]  A solar power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:28.800]  and now a new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:31.800]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:35.800]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:40.800]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:44.800]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:45.800]  one of my old sponsors.

[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:11.800]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:20.800]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:28.800]  They so pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:33.800]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:38.800]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:45.800]  We turned jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:31.800]  Okay, coming up, George Norrie, syndicated overnight talk show host,
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:35.800]  second most listened to in the country on talk radio and radio period,
[01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:41.800]  will be joining us coming up in the third hour today.
[01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:46.800]  Danny Penzella, gonna just pop in for 10 minutes or so right now.
[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:49.800]  And then we'll go to your phone calls.
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:53.800]  He, of course, months ago went out with his baby in a baby stroller to protest the Fed.
[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:58.800]  And they called out 50-something cops and had security alerts in New York over it.
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:01.800]  Later came out in New York Daily News and other publications.
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:04.800]  That's how we discovered the system surveilling in the Fedders.
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:08.800]  Now the Federal Reserve says they're making a list of people that support them or don't.
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:10.800]  Ooh, scary, we're making a list of you too.
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:14.800]  You foreign, you surplus, you globalist offshore banks.
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:19.800]  And now he's gone out and interviewed Dylan Radigan on YouTube, got a bunch of attention.
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:23.800]  Been on Judge Andrew Napolitano's show. He's getting a lot of attention.
[01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:26.800]  And last night, we're still trying to get a hold of Luke Radowski.
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:32.800]  Luke got the big Occupy Wall Street group of thousands of the 10,000 that were marching
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:36.800]  to break off and go towards the private fellow reserve.
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:38.800]  That's, it looks like a giant fortress there.
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:42.800]  And they arrested him and slammed him around, brutalized him and hauled him off.
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:44.800]  We're trying to get a hold of him right now.
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:47.800]  I don't know what's going on with Luke, but we'll try to get him on either today
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:49.800]  or on the nightly news.
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:52.800]  This evening, Rob Jacobson is there in New York.
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:56.800]  I need to call him during the break and find out if they know what's going on with Luke.
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:59.800]  I've been trying to get a hold of him again since last night.
[01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:02.800]  So that's all coming up.
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:07.800]  Also, again, I haven't gotten into some of the Middle East and politics news.
[01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:11.800]  Soros loses a case against French insider trading conviction.
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:15.800]  He tried to get that overturned, but no, he's still a wanted man.
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:21.800]  He's the guy that says he feels for the in Wall Street people.
[01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:22.800]  He agrees with them.
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:23.800]  Well, he should.
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:24.800]  He tried to hijack the group.
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:25.800]  He failed.
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:30.800]  Obama says today that Americans have a right to be angry about what's happening in banking.
[01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:32.800]  Remember that clip he said in the State of the Union.
[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:35.800]  I know how it looks to be helping banks out right now.
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:36.800]  Believe me, I get it.
[01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:41.800]  We were financed not by banks, but by the inner Federal Reserve controllers.
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:47.800]  And then we've got our report, another report up at Drudge on the right hand side.
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:51.800]  Occupy Wall Street stands in solidarity with Obama front group.
[01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:57.800]  Above that college walkout plan anonymous releases threat against New York stock exchange.
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:04.800]  Wall Street protest expected to swell jobless claims rise above 400,000 again.
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:06.800]  Secret panel could put Americans on kill list.
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:08.800]  I'm going to be covering that later.
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:11.800]  Obama Americans frustrated with banks.
[01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:17.800]  They're frustrated with the six owners of the Federal Reserve that bankroll June are now bankrolling Mitt Romney.
[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:23.800]  And of course, Rick Perry while demonizing Ron Paul.
[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:28.800]  Obama Democrats plan to tie GOP to Wall Street.
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:30.800]  So I told you that was their reelection campaign.
[01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:37.800]  I could see it was Occupy Wall Street doesn't mean the people doing it are bad, but they get they had the there's always protest to Wall Street going on.
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:44.800]  So the media gave attention to it gave attention to spokespeople that were calling for collectivism and an end of capitalism and higher taxes.
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:49.800]  So the Democrats could say they represent them that now be sophisticated here.
[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:52.800]  It doesn't mean Occupy Wall Street people are bad.
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:58.800]  They're great, but the globalist are representing that it supports Obama continues.
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:03.800]  If Congress does something that I can't run against a do nothing Congress.
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:11.800]  So that's a quote there. They're trying to block any type of jobs bill right now and then openly blaming the Republicans for it.
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:12.800]  I'm not a Republican fan.
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:13.800]  I'm just telling you they're liars.
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:16.800]  Okay, continuing Biden to fifth graders.
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:17.800]  It's all Bush's fault.
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:19.800]  That's a quote.
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:24.800]  And then when Obama's out, they'll say it's all Obama's fault Bush Obama.
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:26.800]  They all work for the same group.
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:27.800]  That's the message.
[01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:28.800]  I'm trying to get out.
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:32.800]  That's why we're going to occupy the Federal Reserve nationwide tomorrow and over the weekend.
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:38.800]  That's why we need to camp out there to actually target the real culprits and not just nebulous Michael Moore out there.
[01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:40.800]  I'm worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:51.800]  Let's ban capitalism as if free market is what makes things bad free markets made us the wealthiest and greatest nation with the greatest choices in the world.
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:59.800]  And as the free market has been put out the window and and collectivism brought in and insider crony capitalism, we've lost it all.
[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:04.800]  But they're saying no, no, more socialism will fix it.
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:06.800]  So that's some of the news.
[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:11.800]  Some of the news on that front and I promise I'm going to get to Bank of America.
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:14.800]  They're having unprecedented problems with Bank of America website.
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:18.800]  Oh, they can't let you have your money right now.
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:19.800]  It's shut down.
[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:23.800]  Sorry, because all these people are trying to pull their money out.
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:27.800]  They've got actuaries where they know if they don't let you have it for a few days.
[01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:31.800]  You'll tend to not be angry anymore and let them keep your money.
[01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:35.800]  But I've told you for years, they're going to start charging you to keep your money in a bank.
[01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:38.800]  You won't just get one half of one percent interest.
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:40.800]  You will be charged.
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:41.800]  And why is that?
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:43.800]  I'll tell you why later.
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:48.800]  They don't want your money anymore like the Beverly Hillbillies where the bank, you know, which is actually fiction.
[01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:51.800]  But that's how banks used to be, especially local banks.
[01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:54.800]  They're like, we take you out to steak dinner free golf course membership.
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:14:01.800]  Keep your money here, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Clamford, because for every dollar you deposit, they can loan out 10.
[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:05.800]  Since 1999, that's been gone, folks, fractional reserve banking.
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:09.800]  That's what little local banks do.
[01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:10.800]  That's all gone.
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:13.800]  That corrupt system that's dangerous is gone.
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:17.800]  Now, if you're the big six mega banks, unlimited, you control the regulators.
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:21.800]  You can loan out 50 trillion with nothing back in it.
[01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:24.800]  So, of course, they don't want you to put your money in the bank.
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:27.800]  Of course, they're going to charge you to keep your money in there.
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:29.800]  They've got unlimited.
[01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:32.800]  I'll get more into it later.
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:38.800]  The rest of the story, they're layoffs of all the big banks of their customer service people and their branches,
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:40.800]  because they're not going to be there anymore for service.
[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:43.800]  They're there to send SWAT teams to your house and take it in a repossession.
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:46.800]  Okay, let's go to Danny Panzella.
[01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:53.800]  Danny, on the TV show, I want to get you on the TV show and Rob is getting a package together that shows you on the
[01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:57.800]  Palatino show and Fox shows you getting attention all over with Dylan Radigan interview.
[01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:02.800]  Here you are months ago with your baby down there in a stroller by yourself.
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:03.800]  Then you come on this show.
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:05.800]  We call for a demonstration the next day.
[01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:06.800]  Hundreds show up.
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:09.800]  And now here you are with millions seeing what you have to say.
[01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:13.800]  You're another testament of what taking action can do.
[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:16.800]  Yeah, absolutely. Thank you for your support.
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:21.800]  And I want to thank everybody else for all their support and for continuing to spread the message.
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:23.800]  But it's not about me.
[01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:26.800]  Xander was a good little gimmick that kind of got attention.
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:30.800]  But obviously the Federal Reserve is really what we want to draw attention to.
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:34.800]  I've been spending since day one down at Occupy Wall Street.
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:37.800]  I've been down there and I've been talking to people about the free market.
[01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:40.800]  And it's like you said earlier, you really broke it down.
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:42.800]  These are not bad people.
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:47.800]  When you break that, cut through all the rhetoric, really what they want is the same thing that we all want,
[01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:49.800]  which is freedom and equality.
[01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:54.800]  And they just have an idea of how to get there that doesn't work.
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:58.800]  So what I've been down there doing is just talking to them about the free market.
[01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:01.800]  And then they say, oh, well, we have a free market and that's what caused all these problems.
[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:06.800]  And then I can explain to them, well, no, we have a centrally planned economy
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:12.800]  that is run by a private Federal Reserve Bank that's owned by private corporations.
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:15.800]  So that really speaks to them.
[01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:19.800]  And I can see the light bulbs going off in a lot of people's eyes.
[01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:24.800]  And it's very disheartening to see Mike Moore and now the unions and these people coming in
[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:27.800]  and trying to co-opt what was really a grassroots movement.
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:31.800]  And what in the large part they've been able to do with the Tea Party
[01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:34.800]  is kind of get them behind the establishment agenda,
[01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:40.800]  put them in the left or the right box and basically inoculate those two movements.
[01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:44.800]  So what I've been down there trying to do is say, look, the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street
[01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:45.800]  have the same goals.
[01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:46.800]  We need to work together.
[01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:49.800]  We can do this together and the private Federal Reserve.
[01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:52.800]  And then you'll get your voice back.
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:57.800]  Well, beautifully said, but I try to say in 10 hours you say in about two minutes,
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:16:58.800]  you're absolutely right.
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:03.800]  I mean, I called this over a week ago and I really came out Sunday and said, look,
[01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:04.800]  this is being taken over.
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:07.800]  And the left then, the controlled professional left,
[01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:10.800]  tried to spin it that I was saying all the Wall Street people were bad.
[01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:13.800]  That's like when I say Building 7 was clearly blown up.
[01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:15.800]  They say, oh, you're saying the cops did it?
[01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:18.800]  No, I'm not saying the cops did it, but the cops are on video saying get back.
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:19.800]  They're about to bring it down.
[01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:21.800]  They were told get people back.
[01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:22.800]  It's compartmentalization.
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:24.800]  It's the same thing here.
[01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:28.800]  When Obama and move on and Soros admit they're trying to co-opt it,
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:30.800]  I've got to come out and say don't be co-opted.
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:33.800]  That's like three years ago when the Republicans tried to take over the Tea Party.
[01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:35.800]  I said, don't let them take it over.
[01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:37.800]  This is a Ron Paul, True Liberty movement.
[01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:40.800]  And I got the comments, oh, you just hate the Tea Party, Commie.
[01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:46.800]  No, I'm trying to show how the establishment, the left and right head of this monster,
[01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:49.800]  this ogre, is trying to take over our movement.
[01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:50.800]  What do you think of my idea?
[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:53.800]  Obviously, you're going to love it because you were already doing it months ago,
[01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:57.800]  to go and protest the Fed itself and identify the crony capitalist.
[01:17:57.800 --> 01:17:59.800]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:01.800]  I mean, we've actually been trying to do that.
[01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:04.800]  We started OccupyTheFed.net a few weeks ago.
[01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:06.800]  And we've been trying to gain steam.
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:08.800]  And I'm so happy that you've jumped on board with this as well.
[01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:13.800]  And now we've joined up with Stuart Rhodes and some of the other people in the movement
[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:18.800]  to kind of consolidate all our efforts to organize so we can get people in front of every single Fed.
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:22.800]  And you have been obviously invaluable in this fight.
[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:24.800]  You woke most of us up.
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:29.800]  So, you know, we just want to really get as many people as possible to show up.
[01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:31.800]  And we kind of, we're taking a two-pronged approach.
[01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:32.800]  Now, see, hold on.
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:35.800]  I didn't even know that you'd set up and OccupyTheFed.net.
[01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:37.800]  That's common sense when they start their group.
[01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:39.800]  You say, hey, the Federal Reserve's the real threat.
[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:41.800]  I have this epiphany Sunday.
[01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:45.800]  We've got to go after the Fed instead of just saying capitalism.
[01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:48.800]  That is just beautiful.
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:50.800]  Yeah, it's just the synchronicity.
[01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:57.800]  And it's really what we were trying to do was kind of glean off the momentum that the Occupy Wall Street movement has
[01:18:57.800 --> 01:19:03.800]  and just kind of funnel that back into the right direction towards the Fed rather than the strawman of capitalism.
[01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:06.800]  Because we really don't even have true free market capitalism.
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:11.800]  No, you've got six big megabanks that own the Fortune 100 and then some who are organizing the economy
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:14.800]  and everything into themselves and shutting down their competition
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:19.800]  and trying to get more people dependent on their fiat system so they control them.
[01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:21.800]  That's right, absolutely.
[01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:25.800]  And when you break that down for people, you'll see the light bulb go up in their head.
[01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:30.800]  So I want to encourage people, you know, I'm getting a lot of criticism from tea party type people
[01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:36.800]  and right wing type people saying, oh, why are you going down there with all those, you know, socialist and communists?
[01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:39.800]  And I said, well, you know, we've got to convert them to be our allies.
[01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:44.800]  Stay there. Exactly. The reason I get, I've tried to get Michael Moore on this show.
[01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:46.800]  David Rothschild on this show.
[01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:48.800]  Dennis Kucinich on this show.
[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:50.800]  Roseanne Barr yesterday.
[01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:54.800]  I mean, look at Jesse Ventura. I've really been talking to him probably for years.
[01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:57.800]  Look how far he's come since I first met him six years ago.
[01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:20.800]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:34.800]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:57.800 --> 01:21:04.800]  We'll be right back.
[01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:37.800]  We'll be right back.
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:04.800]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.

[01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:29.800]  George Norrie is going to join us for most of the next hour.
[01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:32.800]  Always interesting to get George on and I need some introduction.
[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:37.800]  Danny Penzella, who I didn't even know, they started an occupied fed thing weeks before I did.
[01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:41.800]  It's just common sense that, wow, look at this, they're saying capitalism is the problem.
[01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:43.800]  We don't have capitalism.
[01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:49.800]  We have a government where they say, okay, everybody else's power plant has to basically shut down the general electric.
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:51.800]  We're going to double or triple your power prices.
[01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:52.800]  How's that sound?
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:53.800]  That's freedom.
[01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:57.800]  If you didn't give money to Obama, we're going to shut down your General Motors dealership.
[01:24:57.800 --> 01:24:58.800]  How's that sound?
[01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:02.800]  Or if you're not part of the car law group, we're not going to give you defense contracts.
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:08.800]  I mean, it's, or if you're American small business, you can't get government contracts, even though it's the law you're supposed to.
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:12.800]  I mean, it's just a bunch of insiders raping us seven ways to Sunday.
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:14.800]  It's incredible.
[01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:18.800]  Danny, in closing, that's the same thing I've gone through.
[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:23.800]  The left attacks me saying, you're not fully embracing the end of capitalism.
[01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:24.800]  You're a right-wing fascist.
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:28.800]  You must worship everyone at the Occupy Wall Street worldwide.
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:34.800]  And then I get like conservative people going, you come here having Roseanne Barr on board.
[01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:36.800]  What is your problem?
[01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:39.800]  And the point is, you know, you heard Roseanne Barr.
[01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:40.800]  I've been listening to you a few years now.
[01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:42.800]  Now, you know, I'm second amendment.
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:43.800]  I'm starting to get it.
[01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:47.800]  You know, the point is just hating these people isn't ever going to fix it.
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:52.800]  Now, if you're an operative who's cold-bloodily manipulating like George Soros, yeah, I get it.
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:54.800]  I would not be trying to be friends with George Soros.
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:56.800]  He knows exactly what he's doing.
[01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:58.800]  But a Roseanne Barr, you've got to reach out to her.
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:01.800]  You're not going to get anywhere with her calling her a moron.
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:03.800]  You've got to try to reach out to her.
[01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:08.800]  And I'm not saying Ventura was ever stupid, but when, you know, I first met him six years ago.
[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:10.800]  I gave him 9-11 films.
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:13.800]  He goes, I know my son already gave me these Alex.
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:15.800]  I just don't know.
[01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:17.800]  And then a year later, it's like, I'll come down to Austin.
[01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:19.800]  I'm ready to come on your show.
[01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:20.800]  It's an inside job.
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:22.800]  And then now look where he is.
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:24.800]  See, it's that process.
[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:28.800]  I mean, if I had said Ventura, I don't totally agree with you on these things.
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:29.800]  You're an operative.
[01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:31.800]  Most people aren't operatives.
[01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:32.800]  They're ignorant.
[01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:35.800]  So, yes, I would just ignore people getting mad at you.
[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:40.800]  What's wrong with you going down to the hippies and people and saying, hey, it's the Federal Reserve?
[01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:43.800]  You're doing what the lazy mainline conservatives should be doing.
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:46.800]  They want to sit there and listen to Rush Limbaugh, who supported, you know,
[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:51.800]  and Glenn Beck, who supported the banker bailouts and who support new VAT taxes like O'Reilly
[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:56.800]  and suck their thumbs and judge everybody that's actually in the field.
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:57.800]  Well, you make a good point.
[01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:00.800]  And what I tell people is Jesus hung out with sinners.
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:01.800]  I hang out with socialists.
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:03.800]  So I want to be an influence.
[01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:07.800]  And, you know, they always make the point, the Tea Party, oh, well, that's funded by George Soros.
[01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:12.800]  I said, but yeah, but Fox News is funded by the Sharia-loving Saudi Royals.
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:16.800]  And Rupert Murdoch, who gives all that money that you spend on Fox News products,
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:20.800]  he gives that to Planned Parenthood and the Clintons and other liberal causes.
[01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:23.800]  So if you want to talk about funding, let's talk about funding.
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:29.800]  The bottom line is we have to reach out to these people and convert them into free market, freedom-loving people.
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:30.800]  Well, you're right.
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:31.800]  Oh, that's another thing.
[01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:34.800]  Years ago, I was taking out a context when I was showing that Fox News,
[01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:38.800]  if you added all the Saudis together, was now almost Saudi majority-owned
[01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:42.800]  that a bunch of other major outfits in Hollywood were.
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:46.800]  Obviously, you know, it's Jews, Italians, and others are, you know, dominant in the actual production.
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:49.800]  But Saudi Arabia, incredibly corrupt.
[01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:51.800]  More and more is buying up our media.
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:54.800]  The actual shares, they don't run it.
[01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:57.800]  They own large portions of it is a more accurate statement.
[01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:00.800]  And I'm not getting into a fight with Arabs or something.
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:04.800]  The point is Saudi Arabia, Fox News loves to bash Muslims all day.
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:10.800]  Well, no wonder they do because right under their nose, it's basically a Saudi Arabian outfit.
[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:12.800]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:15.800]  And that's the argument that I try to use with conservatives that say,
[01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:16.800]  oh, I don't want to get involved.
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:21.800]  And look, that's exactly why George Soros and the unions and Mike Moore jump on this thing,
[01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:23.800]  because they want to push the right away.
[01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:27.800]  It's like a reverse psychology operation.
[01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:31.800]  Their job is to get the right to say, I'm not getting involved with that.
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:34.800]  That's, you know, a Soros thing.
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:37.800]  Just like the left wouldn't get involved in the Tea Parties,
[01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:40.800]  because the media said they're racist, they're white, they're evil.
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:43.800]  Automatically, if you're not white now, you can't be for freedom.
[01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:45.800]  That's right. That's right.
[01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:50.800]  And what ends up happening is we focus all our attention on the punching bags in Congress and the president,
[01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:56.800]  and those are replaceable because the banks and the CEOs of the banks and the shareholders of those banks are constant.
[01:28:56.800 --> 01:28:57.800]  They never change.
[01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:01.800]  We can replace Barack Obama with the next puppet, but unless it's someone like Ron Paul,
[01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:07.800]  who's real grassroots, who has been loyal to the Constitution for his whole career,
[01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:10.800]  someone who has that kind of record, you're going to get more of the same,
[01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:13.800]  and those banks are just going to buy you off the next person,
[01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:15.800]  and it's going to be the same thing over and over again.
[01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:18.800]  Hey, Danny, we have set you up for the nightly news tonight, right?
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:19.800]  Yes, sir.
[01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:23.800]  Okay, good. I want to come back in two or three minutes with you on another quick subject,
[01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:28.800]  but I want to say something about Fox News when we come back as well on the other side.
[01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:30.800]  So stay with us.
[01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:33.800]  I'll get us some economic news, this banking news with Bank of America.
[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:34.800]  I'll give you mine.
[01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:35.800]  Well, the rest of the story.
[01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:41.800]  And then we'll go to your phone calls for those that are patiently holding right now.
[01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:44.800]  We're going to go to your calls as well after this break.

[01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:17.800]  The United States has now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:24.800]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:30.800]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.

[01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:51.800]  The police state isn't coming. It's here.
[01:30:51.800 --> 01:31:17.800]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.

[01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:09.280]  we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years. He says it will change
[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:13.840]  everything about our lives. The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even
[01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:17.760]  how you take care of your health and your own family. Now this man has made some outrageous
[01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:23.120]  predictions over the years. The crazy part is he's usually right. You see he predicted the collapse
[01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:27.680]  of GM, Danny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:33.360]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy. Recently he created a video which you can watch
[01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:37.920]  online for free detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet and it's a real eye
[01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:42.480]  opener. I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:46.720]  He explains everything you need to know including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:53.360]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com. That's End of America. The number three.

[01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:13.360]  All right, here's what I want to say about Fox News. Here is a message to Fox News and they know this.
[01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:21.360]  I am the opposite of hollow, arrogant people that live to read off a teleprompter and who want to
[01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:28.000]  live in New York City and who want to be part of that plastic world, okay? Let's get that straight.
[01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:36.000]  And when New York Magazine interviewed me, they were obsessed with asking if I wanted to work
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:43.440]  at Fox News and I said no, no, no, no. I do not want to work at Fox News. I do not want to work
[01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:50.800]  at Fox News. I want to do what I'm doing. And they ignored all that and put a quote in the magazine,
[01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:56.240]  in the article, talking to the president of programming or whatever at Fox Television,
[01:33:56.240 --> 01:34:00.640]  the guy running Fox News, the guy running Roger Ailes, who really is the programmer.
[01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:06.240]  And the guy said, Alex wants to be on Fox, but we don't want him.
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:12.160]  So again, this is all part of their illusion. All the mainstream media, who by the way are
[01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:18.000]  all losing viewers. Fox is losing viewers as well. They're just at the top of the sinking ship,
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:22.080]  so they're like at the top of the mast. The alternative media is taking over. Glenn Beck
[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:29.520]  is left happy, making more money and reaching more people online. And again, it's not that I care
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:33.680]  about Fox News's arrogant statement about me. I don't think I even talked about it at the time
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:44.880]  because it gets at me. It's done so that readers marvel at Fox like some Valhalla or some Mount
[01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:52.240]  Olympus where the gods live, that unknown country, the magic of it, the info babes looking at the
[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:57.600]  teleprompter like they sexually desire it. So men watch TV and feel like it's their girlfriend.
[01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:04.400]  And that's why the government buildings are so big, the bank buildings are so big,
[01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:07.440]  the big marble columns, it's about making you feel small.
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:13.040]  My show is bigger than anyone Fox News show.
[01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:20.720]  Conservatively, AMFM shortwave satellite, XM, shortwave. Let me go look at the numbers.
[01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:26.400]  Way bigger than anyone Fox News show. Legends in their own mind.
[01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:31.200]  See, I live in the real world and you have the, I'm not knocking old people,
[01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:37.600]  but if you look at the different numbers and actuaries, Fox News has an extremely elderly
[01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:42.960]  and dying audience. They have one of the oldest audiences in television. And that's great.
[01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:49.680]  That's great. That's great for your advertisers. That's wonderful. And you've got, you know,
[01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:54.560]  you can see it, drug ads on there, diaper ads, things like that. Those are wonderful people.
[01:35:54.560 --> 01:36:02.720]  And, and, and we care about them as well, but the truth is the future. And it's so insulting
[01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:09.760]  to have them play me as their set piece, the leftist Cass Sunstein lover, writer,
[01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:16.080]  and the Fox News people together in that article saying, Alex Jones wants to be at Fox News.
[01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:22.880]  To the point of, you know, years ago when they wanted me to go on Fox News, I wouldn't go.
[01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:26.320]  I sent one of my radio producers to be on there because they were begging.
[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:30.480]  Now, if they send a car to pick me up at my house and want me to go down there and do it on
[01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:37.200]  satellite, I'll do it. I've been on there a few times. No response. It's nothing.
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:45.920]  No hits on the website. No nothing. Paper, tiger, a joke. Go on some Christian station. Huge response.
[01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:56.320]  Go on the Drudge Report, just off the charts, millions of people. That's where the real audiences are.
[01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:02.960]  Not in fantasy land. I mean, whenever I'm on some national TV show, who you were on History Channel,
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:08.480]  who you were on, uh, true TV, who, I mean, I've told national TV most of the time,
[01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:14.000]  I don't even return their calls. It's not worth it for me. If you'll come interview me, I might talk
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:19.440]  to you. Let's get that straight. So this big national host, uh, who will go on names. He's a
[01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:24.240]  nice guy wanted me to come up there to be part of a Fox News TV show he's doing. And I'm like,
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:29.120]  I don't want to go. No, they don't want me. They're going to say no anyways. They're going to think I
[01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:34.000]  want to be there. And he's finally like, okay, I begged him. I think they may let you come up here.
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:40.240]  And I just got to tell him no because it just plays into the whole fantasy. I don't want to go
[01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:45.120]  up there with a bunch of plastic people. I want to go hang around at some boat dock with an old man
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:51.440]  and drink beer and fish. Or I want to go paddle around in a canoe with my kids and a river. I
[01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:58.080]  don't want to go hang around with a bunch of fake people. I'd rather go to some place like
[01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:03.200]  Monument Valley, Utah and go into some barbecue joint and talk to some old Indian for three hours.
[01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:07.680]  I do not want to hang around with fake people. I don't want your accolades,
[01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:14.480]  your glitz, your names, all of it. And you will not take my soul. You will not create a counterfeit
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:20.960]  and claim I've given up my soul and claim I want to be on your Fox News and I dream of it. No,
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:28.080]  it's a nightmare. A nightmare scenario would be for me if national TV offered me a position
[01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:34.880]  and let me say whatever I wanted because it'd be a lie once they got me there to manipulate.
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:41.520]  I would turn down a national TV show right now. I've been offered them over and over and over.
[01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:48.400]  Again, I've been offered not just discussions but deals on major networks for reality TV and
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:52.800]  that would be selling out because the way it was going to be done, I know is to make us look stupid.
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:39:02.240]  And I said no. I said no. You wouldn't believe who I've said no to. And then those idiots over at
[01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:10.080]  Fox, you know, I can call up basically any famous person randomly, almost all of them are listeners.
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:20.080]  That's affecting change. That's real. See, I'm into reality. I'm not into fancy teleprompters and
[01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:27.120]  what looks like glitz and what looks like reality. I'm into the real thing. I'm sorry,
[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:32.640]  our guest is holding. I got to get it to your calls. Curtis, Eric, Kerry, Tim, Tommy, at least
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:38.720]  get to those. I want to have our guest finish up. It's just that this talk show host wanted me to
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:43.040]  go up there. And I told him a month ago, I said, I probably won't, but you can ask him. And I said,
[01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:47.440]  they're going to say no and giggle and get off on it and all this stuff. And Alex wants to come
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:52.640]  up here. And that's exactly what was going on. And now they're saying we'll see. Well, I won't come
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:58.320]  up there to be on your stupid Fox show, even if you sent a private jet with a red carpet. Okay,
[01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:04.320]  get that through your head. I do not want to be on your toilet bowl TV show. I do not want to be
[01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:10.080]  on your, not the host, but your, your, your system. I don't want to be around a bunch of thin vampires.
[01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:16.640]  I want to be around people that are boiling with life, boiling with red blood, boiling with energy.
[01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:24.640]  I like sunlight. I like beauty. I like honor. I like truth. I like war against evil. I spill my
[01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:31.440]  blood and guts and soul out against you. You think I want you? I despise you. I want to vomit on you.
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:37.920]  You're a vapor. You're a fraud. You're a scam. I have everything I want. I'm fulfilled. My cup
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:48.160]  runneth over. You think I want your desiccated plastic wax museum garbage? You want me to be mean
[01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:55.280]  and really tell you what I think about all you people? Solace into how you look completely
[01:40:55.280 --> 01:41:02.560]  vain and empty. I stare into the cosmos. I stare into eternity. My mind explodes with fractal,
[01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:09.040]  geometric understanding. You have nothing. You are vassals, puppets of other men.
[01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:16.000]  You play to their tune. I play my own tune. Got it? All right. I apologize to our guest,
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:22.400]  but I held him over. Danny Panzilla up there fighting the Fed. What happened to Luke Radowski
[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:28.240]  last night? Do you know? Well, I'm guessing that he's probably resting from his ordeal last night.
[01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:33.520]  As far as I know, he didn't actually get arrested. He was manhandled a little bit, but he was okay.
[01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:38.720]  Last time I spoke to the group, which was probably around 11 o'clock or so. So I'm guessing
[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:42.480]  he's probably resting because I'm sure he ran right home to edit a video to get it out.
[01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:47.520]  Well, Luke is now IM-ing us right now. Speak of the, we've been trying to get a hold of him.
[01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:51.600]  I heard he was taken off, but I guess sometimes they just stick you in the police car for a while.
[01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:57.440]  Yeah, sometimes. Listen, I just want to give a quick shout out to Houston Free Thinkers.
[01:41:57.440 --> 01:42:02.720]  They're going to be down there with you tomorrow at the Fed, and they've been instrumental in
[01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:08.560]  helping getting this occupythefed.net set up. I just want to encourage everybody,
[01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:13.840]  if you're within the sound of my voice, come out, join one of these Fed protests wherever you are.
[01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:20.400]  If you can't get to a Fed or a Fed office, set up a protest in front of one of the major banks,
[01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:26.320]  the shareholders of the Fed, and email us at occupythefed.net, and we'll put that protest
[01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:31.360]  up on the website so that other people in your area can find it, and let's just all work together
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:37.280]  and redirect and take advantage of this momentum that Occupy Wall Street has created and redirected
[01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:41.840]  towards the real enemy, the private banking cartel, the Federal Reserve Bank. And sure,
[01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:47.200]  a caveat on my whole Fox News rant. I like Judge Napolitano. I like Lou Dobbs. And of course,
[01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:51.120]  they've been both told not to come on my show now. And I've been up there in New York and had Glenn
[01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:57.520]  Beck block me from going on Napolitano's show before he left. But again, I didn't care. It was
[01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:02.160]  like no big deal whenever I was told, oh, well, you were set up, but now you're not. I mean,
[01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:07.840]  my whole rant is we have our own media. And so they have to act like we need them,
[01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:12.880]  and that we're lacking when we're not. I mean, you know, my operation has got all the junk in
[01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:18.400]  the trunk 10 times what they got. Do you see what I'm saying? Yeah, absolutely. We are the media.
[01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:23.360]  We are the real media. And we're going to continue to do what we do. And no one can stop us. Like
[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:30.960]  Ron Paul says, you can't stop an idea whose time has come. Yep, Victor Hugo, thank you so much,
[01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:34.640]  brother. We look forward to talking to you soon. All right, thank you. By the way, are you guys
[01:43:34.640 --> 01:43:39.600]  going to go to the Fed tomorrow on the Occupy the Fed Day? Yes, we are going to be there tomorrow.
[01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:44.640]  What we're planning to do is have a contingent of people there every day until the culmination,
[01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:49.040]  the big event on November 22, which is the traditional and the Fed Day. All right, thank you
[01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:54.880]  so much, brother. We'll talk to you tonight on info wars nightly news. Okay, there goes our guest
[01:43:54.880 --> 01:44:00.480]  coming up George Norrie. That was Danny Penzella. I'm Alex Jones. I do want to get to a round of
[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:05.440]  calls or so. I've got to get into this unprecedented problems with Bank of America website, some other
[01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:10.880]  economy news. But for just three or four minutes, I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up who grabs and
[01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:15.920]  snatches in the market as much gold and silver as he can when they artificially drive it down
[01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:19.200]  as they've done over and over again the last 10 years. But overall, it only goes up because of
[01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:22.960]  currency devaluation. He's got a lot of gold and silver. He bought when they drove it down,
[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:28.080]  but gold and silver over the last few weeks have retraced some of their losses. And Ted is running
[01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:33.040]  out of some of the lowest price stuff. So I wanted to give people the opportunity now to get a hold
[01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:39.760]  of high quality silver gold coins at absolute wholesale drop, you know, dead, gorgeous prices.
[01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:41.920]  Ted Anderson, thank you for joining us.
[01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:57.200]  We don't have Ted live today. He was on TalkBack with us and our regular people aren't up there
[01:44:57.200 --> 01:45:01.920]  today. Hello. Can you hear me now? Yeah, Ted, go ahead and start back over. Yeah, sorry. Was that
[01:45:01.920 --> 01:45:06.400]  on our end or on Ted's end? No, no, I'm sure it's on our end. There was probably a button. No big
[01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:11.280]  deal. Just making sure it's not me. Go ahead, Ted. Yeah, no, $73 still. Alex, anybody that's
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:16.480]  picked up that American dream video knows by now have watched this knows why you should be standing
[01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:21.840]  at the Fed. If there's any other reason at all, that explains it right there. And then how about
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:27.520]  this? How about bringing those silver dollars to the Fed and show people what real money was?
[01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:33.360]  This is what the Constitution was written for. This is what Thomas Jefferson meant when he said,
[01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:38.480]  I want to have silver and gold as money and I don't want a central bank ruling this world.
[01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:43.600]  Those silver dollars were the exact ones that he designed, the ones that he wanted in there for us,
[01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:49.040]  and the ones that you're getting with this book and video. And believe me, silver dollars
[01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:57.040]  are going up in price. They have, I mean, quite a lot. Silver hit a peak today of $32.16,
[01:45:57.040 --> 01:46:03.760]  presently right now trading at just a minute, $31.97. I mean, you can't, I mean, the video,
[01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:08.320]  the book alone, is that you're not going to buy that. You get it for free and you're going to pay
[01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:13.840]  about 40 bucks for that. And here you, for $88, you get two silver dollars that video. I mean,
[01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:20.080]  people need to understand what it is that the Fed is doing to us, why the dollar is losing,
[01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:25.520]  purchasing power, why your politicians are bought out, and why it doesn't seem to make a difference,
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:30.480]  whether if you elect a Republican or a Democrat, it doesn't make a difference.
[01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:34.960]  Well, Ted, I can tell you don't even want to promote gold and silver today. You were just fired up
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:38.560]  that we're going head up against the Fed. And that means anywhere you are in the country,
[01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:42.720]  go demonstrate against them. And again, the media is showing up in mass. They already had one today
[01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:47.760]  in Dallas. Huge cover is going to be even bigger tomorrow. It's happening all over the country.
[01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:53.520]  We're identifying the Fed. What do you think of Bernanke? In fact, guys, pull up Bernanke
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:47:01.600]  agrees with or understands the anger of Occupy Wall Street. This shows how they're hoping George
[01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:07.040]  Soros and others to say that their friends with Occupy Wall Street in an attempt to take it over
[01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:12.080]  and we'll get those rich people, we'll raise taxes when they're offshore and get the tax money
[01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:17.680]  through banker bailouts and theft. I mean, they are so desperate right now to have Bernanke come
[01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:24.800]  out and say, oh, I feel the pain of the people on Occupy Wall Street. They are so scared that
[01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:28.800]  we're going to go out and actually identify them. Well, that's right, because it's all about diversion
[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:34.640]  and deception, Alex. The reason why Wall Street got bailed out is because of the fact that the
[01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:41.040]  Fed's appointed guy is sitting here as the Treasury Secretary and saying, hey, you got to bail out
[01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:45.680]  these guys because the buddies of the Fed, the shareholders of the Fed right now are in trouble.
[01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:50.400]  So we take all of these newly printed dollars, which is basically just stealing money from the
[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:56.080]  people and giving them to these elite people that have, you know, they've had the world handed to
[01:47:56.080 --> 01:48:00.400]  them. They have everything they need at their fingertips. Well, Ted, here's another point.
[01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:05.280]  This is a Steve Watson article out at infowars.com dealing with all of this very important to get
[01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:10.480]  out to people. Wall Street puppet Obama sympathizes with anti-Wall Street protesters. Again, we just
[01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:16.320]  put on screen Bernanke saying he sympathizes and understands them. In fact, put that back up so
[01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:21.760]  I can give folks the exact quote. Thank you. You know, Bernanke saying he understands when
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:26.960]  he was in a testimony. Bernanke on Occupy Wall Street protest. I can't blame them.
[01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:32.080]  And he went on to say he understands now Obama claims government has not gone after banksters
[01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:38.480]  because a lot of practices going on weren't against the law. And notice how Goldman Sachs,
[01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:45.200]  JP Morgan Bank of America Wells Fargo city group through Obama and also under Bush before he left
[01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:50.640]  basically ordered every major bank to take bailout money. So they'd be complicit in all of it. And
[01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:54.160]  some banks just refused. And then when they took the money, they found out they were going to use
[01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:59.680]  regulators selectively against them. So they gave it back your credit unions, your local banks.
[01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:05.680]  I mean, he is run by the very group Larry Summers and Robert Rubin that got rid of Glass-Steagall
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:12.640]  in 99 under Harry Clinton. I mean, this is incredible to watch Obama try this new bamboozlement,
[01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:16.800]  just like he did in the last election to claim he's fighting corrupt Wall Street interest
[01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:22.320]  when the guy he is the most Wall Street puppet ever seen. This is this would be like Hitler
[01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:28.400]  showing up in the Nuremberg trials and saying that he wanted to, you know, be the head judge
[01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:34.560]  against the Nazis. I mean, this is a sick joke. It's not even a sick joke. It's what we were
[01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:42.000]  warned against when the constitution was drafted by the forefathers of this country. We cannot have
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:47.360]  a central bank make the currency of the nation. Otherwise, we will become indebted to them.
[01:49:47.360 --> 01:49:52.880]  They will buy out and take away the nation. Our forefathers fought for just like they laid it out
[01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:59.040]  for us. It is absolutely there. If they just wake up to this, Ted, you got a head federal reserve
[01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:02.560]  up in your area. Are you going to be out there this weekend? Well, yep, we're going to be right
[01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:09.280]  over at the one right down to Minneapolis. But I got to tell you, it just it it boils my blood
[01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:14.160]  to watch this country go down the road that it's in. And like you said, man, if you can move those
[01:50:14.160 --> 01:50:18.880]  people out of Wall Street and march them right down to the Fed, you'll find the true enemy of
[01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:23.520]  this war of this country. It's there. They're the ones that are creating the money from nothing.
[01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:28.960]  They're lending it to us, charging us interest on it. And we have to have it for comment. I got
[01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:32.960]  to go to calls after this. We haven't even promoted the Golden Silver deals. Folks call it's a big

[01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:42.080]  the lost leaders. They got the two silver dollars, the book, the video for 70 something bucks. That's
[01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:51.680]  an incredible deal. Free shipping 80686237. What is that 73 bucks 806862237. They got a bunch of
[01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:58.080]  silver and gold specials asking for the Alex Jones list of specials 806862237

[01:52:26.640 --> 01:52:31.760]  and friends as they melt down under pressure, and only 1 out of 10 will take swift and decisive
[01:52:31.760 --> 01:52:36.240]  action when the going gets tough, dramatically increasing their chances of survival. That's

[01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:54.240]  All right, I want to go to Curtis and Eric and Kerry and Tim and Tommy. Who knows, you might just
[01:54:54.240 --> 01:54:57.360]  get to sit and hold and talk to George Norrie, but I'm going to get to you in a minute. At least
[01:54:57.360 --> 01:55:00.880]  some of you. I really want to hear from you. Ted, finish up. Tell folks about some of the
[01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:05.120]  Golden Silver specials you've got. We spent three or four minutes ranting about the Private
[01:55:05.120 --> 01:55:10.560]  Federal Reserve, and now we're going to occupy their surroundings all over the country, the center,
[01:55:10.560 --> 01:55:15.760]  epicenter being Dallas, tomorrow night. But Ted, tell us about some of the specials.
[01:55:15.760 --> 01:55:21.280]  Yeah, sure. I mean, Franks, right now you can pick them up at 358.70. It does get you a full year
[01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:26.640]  subscription to the International Forecaster. I mean, that's 159 bucks. It's like buying gold at
[01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:33.040]  $1,000 an ounce, even though we all know it's in the 1600s. Right now we have the Walking Liberty
[01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:39.040]  Haves at 1560. I think that's a great buy. I'm putting that campaign for Liberty Coin up. I only
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:45.520]  have about 200 of them left. That coin right now is 492. I can't think of a better person to support
[01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:50.560]  other than Ron Paul, but I'm not going to make them again. That particular die is going to be
[01:55:50.560 --> 01:55:55.440]  broken because the people that bottom understood, I made $1,000, and that's it, and there's about
[01:55:55.440 --> 01:56:01.840]  200 left. If you want a quarter ounce coin that's certified in a leatherette case, proof condition,
[01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:06.560]  and at a real good price, you can't even buy a silver, a gold eagle, you know, that's about the
[01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:11.760]  same price as those. You know, you can't beat it, plus also to support the campaign for Liberty,
[01:56:11.760 --> 01:56:17.840]  which is Ron Paul's organization, and that's all about ending the Fed. What else do I have here?
[01:56:17.840 --> 01:56:27.280]  Look, you know, the $20 double legal right now, $20, $2,053 is a good buy. Just, there's a whole
[01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:33.520]  one. You got it all. Here's the number 800-686-2237. Ted, shoot some video of your demonstration
[01:56:33.520 --> 01:56:38.880]  against the Fed this weekend. Now, what time is that, Ted? You know what, I'm not the organizer.
[01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:42.240]  I think they're going to be doing it at noon, but I got to find out. Yeah, but this is exciting.
[01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:46.400]  This is really spread all over the country. Very exciting. Great job, Ted. Yeah. All right,
[01:56:46.400 --> 01:56:49.200]  let's go to Curtis in Virginia. Curtis, you're on the air. Welcome.
[01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:58.240]  Hello. Yes, my friend. Welcome. Yes, Brother Alex. How are you today? I am broadcasting
[01:56:58.240 --> 01:57:02.640]  worldwide and very excited to hear about protesting the Fed going on all over the country.
[01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:08.160]  Outstanding. Outstanding. A couple things. Well, before I say anything, I got to say,
[01:57:08.160 --> 01:57:13.760]  I don't do hero worship, but I do respect the man, his team, and his work. You're doing a great
[01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:22.000]  job. Well, thank you, sir. I'm calling to sort of disagree with you, but then again,
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:29.440]  I don't really disagree with you. I want to open up a dialogue. It's all about the terms
[01:57:29.440 --> 01:57:37.040]  free market and capitalism. I totally agree that we need to abolish the Federal Reserve.
[01:57:37.040 --> 01:57:41.920]  The Federal Reserve got to go. All right. If we do anything, we definitely got to get rid of the
[01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:47.680]  Federal Reserve, where I think we slightly defer, and I would like to hear open dialogue,
[01:57:47.680 --> 01:57:56.480]  more dialogue across the board or is how we execute free market and how we execute the term
[01:57:56.480 --> 01:58:04.320]  capitalism. Now, prior to the Federal Reserve, free market capitalism was sort of based on
[01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:08.880]  slavery, indentured service. Tell you what, stay there. We got to go to break. I'm going to come
[01:58:08.880 --> 01:58:13.840]  back to you. This is a big question. Look, nothing's ever been perfect. You're right.
[01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:18.800]  And now if we get rid of the Federal Reserve, the elites have already stolen basically most of the
[01:58:18.800 --> 01:58:24.560]  property and companies through their power of issuing unlimited currency and credit to themselves.
[01:58:24.560 --> 01:58:30.400]  So what do we do? We audit the Fed, we get rid of the Fed, we send the money back to Congress,
[01:58:30.400 --> 01:58:36.240]  and we have a debate about what system we want to live under. The first thing we got to do is stop
[01:58:36.240 --> 01:58:46.880]  these bankers from setting up world government. You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:58:46.880 --> 01:58:56.560]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[01:58:56.560 --> 01:59:00.560]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my
[01:59:00.560 --> 01:59:06.640]  listeners to do three things right away. Number one, study the past. History really does repeat
[01:59:06.640 --> 01:59:14.480]  itself. Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends. Number three, take decisive
[01:59:14.480 --> 01:59:21.120]  action. A perfect storm is brewing or a global food crisis. That's why I'm telling everyone to
[01:59:21.120 --> 01:59:27.440]  read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves, warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines
[01:59:27.440 --> 01:59:33.520]  in history. Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits. This book is only available
[01:59:33.520 --> 01:59:38.960]  at risingpricesemptyshelves.com. You'll also get a free copy of supermarket survival,
[01:59:38.960 --> 01:59:45.920]  how to cut your grocery bills in half. Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:59:45.920 --> 02:00:09.920]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com. Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:09.920 --> 02:00:17.280]  You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.280 --> 02:00:21.440]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:31.520]  Okay, Curtis in Virginia. If you just join us, George Norris coming up, and I will get to these
[02:00:31.520 --> 02:00:35.280]  callers. I want to hear from you. That's why I gave the number up, but then time runs out.
[02:00:35.280 --> 02:00:43.040]  He was bringing up a concern about free market capitalism. Look, what we have now is a crony
[02:00:44.560 --> 02:00:50.480]  insider cartel mafia system. Okay, so that's what I'm talking about here.
[02:00:53.440 --> 02:01:00.880]  We're talking about a very corrupt system. And so I'm just trying to educate folks about
[02:01:00.880 --> 02:01:06.800]  the current system. And then I'd like to get back to a private property and state sovereignty
[02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:12.480]  and absolute liberty for everybody as long as you don't hurt anybody. And obviously,
[02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:15.760]  you can't just like get rid of the fellow reserve. The globalists are going to come back over and
[02:01:15.760 --> 02:01:21.280]  over again. They've got to be arrested. They've got to be tried. They've got to be punished
[02:01:21.280 --> 02:01:25.840]  because they've got to have their wealth taken away. Now, that's not socialism. I'm talking about
[02:01:25.840 --> 02:01:32.880]  criminals. The globalist have to be dealt with because they've stolen all this stuff. But the
[02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:37.040]  question is, then, if you gave all that stolen wealth to a government, it's going to set up a
[02:01:37.040 --> 02:01:43.520]  new tyranny. So we're in a pickle. I mean, what's your view on that, Curtis?
[02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:51.920]  I totally agree. I totally totally agree. I pulled back to some of your past videos where you
[02:01:51.920 --> 02:01:59.840]  interviewed an economic hitman, you know, and he talks about how they go into other countries
[02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:05.280]  and they steal the resources and all that in the name of capitalism and how they spread
[02:02:07.040 --> 02:02:11.440]  corporate agendas around the world. That's part of the problem as well.
[02:02:12.240 --> 02:02:19.600]  I see the Federal Reserve as a tool for a corrupt form of capitalism and free market.
[02:02:19.600 --> 02:02:26.080]  So what I'm saying is, we have to get rid of the Federal Reserve based on what you just said,
[02:02:26.080 --> 02:02:32.560]  but at the same time, we have to redefine what our economic system should be once we get rid of
[02:02:32.560 --> 02:02:36.880]  that. If not, we're going to still manipulate, we're still going to control, and we're still
[02:02:36.880 --> 02:02:41.440]  going to destroy other countries. Well, look, it's like Ron Paul says, it's like Ron Paul says,
[02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:45.520]  the globalist, the Anglo-American established from whatever you want to call it. And people
[02:02:45.520 --> 02:02:49.200]  always email saying, that means white people. No, it means England in the US. That's what
[02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:54.000]  the globalists call it, the Anglo-American establishment. That's what they call the big
[02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:59.920]  oil company. And I ran that England ran was Anglo oil. But the issue here is,
[02:03:00.880 --> 02:03:05.840]  they have an attitude of conquering, of dominating. They do that to us domestically. We pay for the
[02:03:05.840 --> 02:03:10.800]  empire. We don't benefit from it. And so we got to get past that idea as well. And we got to
[02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:16.000]  realize that Ron Paul says, be friends with people, trade with them. Most countries actually want to
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:21.840]  be friends and want to trade and want to have business. Now, the Soviets were this evil empire
[02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:26.160]  that we had to organize against. But it turns out the globalists, the banksters, were actually
[02:03:26.160 --> 02:03:31.120]  funding that to create this threat so they could build basically the same thing over here.
[02:03:31.120 --> 02:03:35.680]  The globalists know how to manipulate and finance both sides. And so I think more importantly
[02:03:35.680 --> 02:03:40.960]  than anything is an awareness of history and global systems being taught to the general public,
[02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:47.040]  real history being taught. It's exciting. It's addictive. That is a total shield. Thomas Jefferson
[02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:52.640]  said to paraphrase him, educate the general public in history and in basic liberties.
[02:03:53.520 --> 02:04:00.080]  And tyranny will, you know, vanish like phantoms at dawn. A guy searched Thomas Jefferson quote,
[02:04:00.080 --> 02:04:04.480]  phantoms at dawn. And then that'll bring the full quote up. Thank you. I want to give the exact
[02:04:04.480 --> 02:04:09.520]  quote because I kind of butchered it. So look, I'm just trying to move away from the globalists
[02:04:09.520 --> 02:04:14.480]  totally taking over and pointing out their systems bad and giving some general ideas of liberty.
[02:04:16.560 --> 02:04:20.240]  But yes, we need to have a debate about what we want to replace it with as well, sir.
[02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:29.840]  I totally agree. And my biggest concern is that we accomplish some of the things that we go after
[02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:34.960]  and then it's just metamorphosis into something else. That's what always happens. I mean, look,
[02:04:34.960 --> 02:04:38.800]  the fight against evil is always ongoing. People always think in history, well,
[02:04:38.800 --> 02:04:42.800]  we overthrew this tyranny, we overthrew the czars. Now we've got the Bolsheviks.
[02:04:43.680 --> 02:04:50.640]  So yeah, most the time a revolution makes it worse. The bankers admit that they use revolutions,
[02:04:50.640 --> 02:04:54.480]  let everybody tear everything up and then come in and take over afterwards. So yeah,
[02:04:54.480 --> 02:04:57.520]  we're walking a tightrope here, brother. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[02:05:01.920 --> 02:05:07.760]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to
[02:05:07.760 --> 02:05:13.200]  not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath
[02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:19.360]  Americans at home. I've turned memory's influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[02:05:19.360 --> 02:05:25.680]  calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:05:25.680 --> 02:05:31.440]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held
[02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:36.560]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner,
[02:05:36.560 --> 02:05:40.880]  Bernanke, their arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying,
[02:05:40.880 --> 02:05:45.520]  who do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington,
[02:05:45.520 --> 02:05:52.720]  D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at

[02:06:56.640 --> 02:07:06.480]  A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in
[02:07:06.480 --> 02:07:11.920]  America in more than 50 years. He says it will change everything about our lives. The way you shop,
[02:07:11.920 --> 02:07:16.000]  travel, invest, educate your children and even how you take care of your health and your own
[02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:20.720]  family. Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years. The crazy part is
[02:07:20.720 --> 02:07:25.920]  he's usually right. You see he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac and America's
[02:07:25.920 --> 02:07:31.520]  biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties. In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:07:31.520 --> 02:07:36.000]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most
[02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:41.200]  important prediction yet. And it's a real eye-opener. I can't stress this enough. You should at least
[02:07:41.200 --> 02:07:45.360]  watch this free video online today. He explains everything you need to know, including simple

[02:07:58.160 --> 02:08:21.680]  That's End of America 3.com. Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:21.680 --> 02:08:49.680]  Well, he is the second most listened to radio talk show host in the world. 16 million on terrestrial radio, couple million more on the internet and XM Sirius, all those other systems. And I've been reading the trade publications. If he continues to grow within six months to a year, he will be undisputed number one radio talk show host in the world, eclipsing the great one in talk radio, Rush Limbaugh.
[02:08:49.680 --> 02:09:03.680]  Now, we're joined by, of course, George Norrie. We only got him for about 35 minutes or so, because I guess we're keeping him up from his sleep right now, getting ready for his show tonight. I don't know when the guy sleeps. I actually talked to him in the morning sometimes, the afternoon.
[02:09:03.680 --> 02:09:27.680]  But George Norrie joins us and a subject, I don't get into some of the subjects George covers. He took the show seven, eight years ago in a new direction, covering more political stuff and hardcore issues. And we appreciate that. But he does get into some of the metaphysical. But one area I have covered, just because I've talked to family that's experienced it, to Colonel Craig Roberts and others that have experienced it, people who die do go over to the other side.
[02:09:27.680 --> 02:09:45.680]  People who are Aboriginal Indians have never read the Western culture Bible, have the same experience with angels, golden gates. Some people go to hell and come back. But George has gone further with talking to the dead coast to coast AM host George Norrie, a new book that's out available at Amazon.com.
[02:09:45.680 --> 02:09:56.680]  And I've actually ordered one and intend to read it because I'm fascinated with the other side who isn't. I want to get into the book, but then obviously in a limited time, George, pick your brain about a couple other issues.
[02:09:56.680 --> 02:09:58.680]  Sure thing. We'll do Alex. How have you been?
[02:09:58.680 --> 02:10:08.680]  Oh, I've been great. And I've worked late a lot. So sometimes when I'm up doing stuff, I listen to coast to coast AM a couple days a week and then don't get me sleep because I get addicted listening.
[02:10:08.680 --> 02:10:25.680]  Well, we get addicted every time you're on the program to buy. I can, I can see the skewing in our ratings. Alex, every time you're on coast to coast, people just love what you're doing. And I've got to tell you, the alternative world is no longer the alternative world.
[02:10:25.680 --> 02:10:39.680]  The things that you do and the things that we've been doing, I think are becoming regular, important issues worldwide. And everything we've talked about over the years, everything seems to be coming true.
[02:10:39.680 --> 02:10:48.680]  And I find that to be not only startling, but absolutely riveting. And, you know, and listeners are beginning to appreciate that.
[02:10:48.680 --> 02:11:01.680]  I know. I mean, you went out on a limb, I don't know, eight years ago when you took over coast to coast weeknights, a lot of people are, wow, this guy's really getting into 9 11 truth world government federal reserve.
[02:11:01.680 --> 02:11:14.680]  And now I don't want to say we become passé because we're, you know, we're always pioneering and more cutting edge. But now you've got Glenn Beck and all of them, you know, becoming incredibly popular covering a lot of the same subjects.
[02:11:14.680 --> 02:11:28.680]  Yeah, absolutely. And of course, I will give you credit where credit is due. You're the one who paved the way for everybody to do this. I mean, you know, when I came in, coast to coast was the paranormal show.
[02:11:28.680 --> 02:11:39.680]  You know, as a matter of fact, people would say, oh, that's that's the UFO show. And that is now a small portion of what we do, because this world has changed.
[02:11:39.680 --> 02:11:55.680]  You know, for the last 10 years, this world has gone into such a metamorphosis that if we as broadcasters did not keep pace with that, did not change, did not alter the things we did, we would have been gone.
[02:11:55.680 --> 02:12:12.680]  And we had to adjust. And I'm just glad that I was able to get convinced by people who called me about you years ago saying, you got to listen to this guy. Because as you know, originally, I said, man, what do I want to promote another talk show host guy for?
[02:12:12.680 --> 02:12:13.680]  Yeah.
[02:12:13.680 --> 02:12:21.680]  But then, you know, I said, you know what, he's not just a talk show host guy. He's a truth seeker. And we've got to do that on this planet.
[02:12:21.680 --> 02:12:34.680]  Well, you certainly do it on your show. And you know, you talk about the paranormal and stuff kind of taking a back seat or being a third of the show now. And I like that direction. But I got to admit, that some of those shows, as I'm always dealing with such, you know, in your face things.
[02:12:34.680 --> 02:12:47.680]  That's the show where I'm driving home at 1am, where I'm actually looking in the back seat behind me. That's the show. When I get into the house, I go ahead and grab some orange juice and fire up the computer and flick on the, you know, the AM Radio 590 here locally.
[02:12:47.680 --> 02:13:00.680]  And listen, so I think it's really a great mix. And you're a master talk show host and just amazing George. And folks, people know I don't kiss up to people. I mean, George really is a master at what he does.
[02:13:00.680 --> 02:13:16.680]  I mean, take Austin, Texas. You've got a 50 share I saw a month or so ago in the newspaper. And in some areas, you've got a 60 share. I mean, we're talking about, of all radio, period, you've got more than half the listeners in this country.
[02:13:16.680 --> 02:13:29.680]  Well, it's growing. It's a phenom. And I think what we've done is we've touched the pulse of Americans. And they are looking for information. They're looking for people to tell them the truth.
[02:13:29.680 --> 02:13:43.680]  And that's what we're doing. And then as you were talking about the latest book, Talking to the Dead, as I was leaving the studio last night in the wee hours the morning, I saw what I thought was a dead person outside of our studio door.
[02:13:43.680 --> 02:13:54.680]  I kid you not, some guy just flat on his face with his coat over his head, you know, in pitch black. He was dead. He looked dead.
[02:13:54.680 --> 02:14:02.680]  You know, security guard came out and kicked him and the guy started snoring. And he said, oh, my gosh, you better call the cops and get him away.
[02:14:02.680 --> 02:14:09.680]  This planet is going through so many weird things right now. I can't keep track of him. Can you?
[02:14:09.680 --> 02:14:16.680]  No, I can. In fact, I've reached total overload with the amount of craziness that's going on. Tell us about your book.
[02:14:16.680 --> 02:14:27.680]  Well, the book is called Talking to the Dead. And it is a book about the spirit world and what people are trying to do to communicate with the other side.
[02:14:27.680 --> 02:14:33.680]  And it is truly one of the most incredible stories I've ever, ever have done.
[02:14:33.680 --> 02:14:48.680]  I wrote the book, Alex, with Rosemary Ellen Giley, who's an expert in the paranormal. And she is a great researcher and the two of us started investigating the various ways that people are trying to communicate with the other side.
[02:14:48.680 --> 02:14:59.680]  And it's really uncanny. There are some hucksters out there and some frauds, but there are also some people out there who truly think that they can communicate with those on the other side.
[02:14:59.680 --> 02:15:05.680]  Maybe one day you're going to feel a phone call from someone who's passed on. Maybe Abe Lincoln will tell you.
[02:15:05.680 --> 02:15:10.680]  Well, I'm going to say this. Because of the political things I get into, I stay out of this because of how it would be used.
[02:15:10.680 --> 02:15:20.680]  But I've had some interesting experiences in my life. I'm going to leave it at that. And there is a lot going on on this planet out in space that we haven't figured everything out yet.
[02:15:20.680 --> 02:15:30.680]  And in fact, I don't think we've figured out one percent of what's happening. But what about this? I know there are hucksters out there claiming they communicate with the dead, but there's also people who do believe they are.
[02:15:30.680 --> 02:15:39.680]  And it surely may be happening. I know that the near-death experiences when people actually die, they're experiencing similar things.
[02:15:39.680 --> 02:15:45.680]  People I really respect or they come back with new knowledge. But what about hucksters on the other side?
[02:15:45.680 --> 02:15:54.680]  What about when a lot of Christians believe that these are actually demons masquerading as the dead with this whole necromancy situation?
[02:15:54.680 --> 02:16:02.680]  That's absolutely true. You just never know what's on the other side. You don't know what's coming across these various portals.
[02:16:02.680 --> 02:16:07.680]  I don't play with Ouija boards anymore because you never know what you're going to get.
[02:16:07.680 --> 02:16:20.680]  And a lot of people who are extremely spiritual of religious think that we're being tricked because of the work of the devil and that they will do anything they can to possess people to take over.
[02:16:20.680 --> 02:16:24.680]  I think most of our politicians, other than Ron Paul, I think they're all possessed.
[02:16:24.680 --> 02:16:25.680]  I do too.
[02:16:25.680 --> 02:16:34.680]  It is unbelievable. And we're just going through right now one of the most incredible times I have ever seen.
[02:16:34.680 --> 02:16:40.680]  In my years, I've never seen the world so toxic urban.
[02:16:40.680 --> 02:16:49.680]  And my theory is that the globalists are doing everything they can to do this as quickly as they can.
[02:16:49.680 --> 02:16:59.680]  And the reason why they're under so much stress and pressure to get this done now is because they know we finally know and that we've had enough.
[02:16:59.680 --> 02:17:00.680]  Yes.
[02:17:00.680 --> 02:17:05.680]  We're out to push and push and push. And we're not going to stop.
[02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:09.680]  Well, it's like the movie They Live, the sunglasses are now going on.
[02:17:09.680 --> 02:17:13.680]  George, I want to come back in the next little segment or two that we have with you.
[02:17:13.680 --> 02:17:16.680]  You've got to go at 40 after or so because I know you're busy.
[02:17:16.680 --> 02:17:25.680]  And get into Occupy Wall Street, The Globalist, what you think from your deep research and all the experts you've talked to, their master plan is.
[02:17:25.680 --> 02:17:30.680]  But first, spend a few minutes because I wanted to get you on because I saw the book had just come out.
[02:17:30.680 --> 02:17:34.680]  And you don't like to toot your own horn, but I've read your past books. They're excellent.
[02:17:34.680 --> 02:17:37.680]  Give us a snapshot of this new book.
[02:17:37.680 --> 02:17:48.680]  Talking to the Dead is a book that will help people understand what happens to all of us when it's time to check out and go to the other side.
[02:17:48.680 --> 02:17:55.680]  It will explain the various methods that are out there to communicate with the spirit world.
[02:17:55.680 --> 02:17:59.680]  And more importantly, it's affordable, Alex, to Amazon.com.
[02:17:59.680 --> 02:18:02.680]  I mean, this is going to be in bookstores Tuesday all over the country.
[02:18:02.680 --> 02:18:06.680]  But Amazon's selling it right now at like $14 and change.
[02:18:06.680 --> 02:18:13.680]  I don't know how they do it. I guess because they don't own real estate, they're able to discount these things tremendously.
[02:18:13.680 --> 02:18:21.680]  But it's going up in the charts in, you know, a very coast to coast listener and every listener to Alex Jones picked up a copy.
[02:18:21.680 --> 02:18:23.680]  We'd have a bestseller on our hands.
[02:18:23.680 --> 02:18:26.680]  Well, there's people that don't care about what they do to the world.
[02:18:26.680 --> 02:18:29.680]  And I've found they're never spiritual people.
[02:18:29.680 --> 02:18:33.680]  I've learned what you do comes back on you many fold.
[02:18:33.680 --> 02:18:35.680]  I guess that's what they mean by the term God fearing.
[02:18:35.680 --> 02:18:37.680]  You don't have to wait till you die to be punished.
[02:18:37.680 --> 02:18:41.680]  In my experience, you're punished while you're here and while you're alive.
[02:18:41.680 --> 02:18:44.680]  And I've talked to so many family members.
[02:18:44.680 --> 02:18:47.680]  My uncle died six times when he had a motorcycle accident.
[02:18:47.680 --> 02:18:53.680]  And he saw everything Colonel Craig Roberts saw when he died for 10 minutes during cancer surgery.
[02:18:53.680 --> 02:19:00.680]  And, you know, the guardian angel that's been there your whole life, that was your imaginary friend when you were a kid, all of that.
[02:19:00.680 --> 02:19:02.680]  I'm here to tell you, George, it's real.
[02:19:02.680 --> 02:19:05.680]  It is real. There's no question about it, Alex.
[02:19:05.680 --> 02:19:14.680]  And, you know, one day we will all see it on the other side. And, you know, while we're talking about it, condolences with the family of Steve Jobs.
[02:19:14.680 --> 02:19:18.680]  I mean, you talk about a new era, Thomas Edison.
[02:19:18.680 --> 02:19:21.680]  I mean, the guy was an absolute genius.
[02:19:21.680 --> 02:19:24.680]  And this planet needs more and more people like that.
[02:19:24.680 --> 02:19:28.680]  Steve Jobs, no doubt, was a major genius.
[02:19:28.680 --> 02:19:34.680]  And when we come back, we'll speak a little bit more about Steve Jobs and then get into where George Norrie thinks the global controllers are taking us.
[02:19:34.680 --> 02:19:41.680]  And who he thinks basically commands those heights and where he sees this collision of tyrants and those that love liberty.
[02:19:41.680 --> 02:19:44.680]  The new book, ladies and gentlemen, available on Amazon.com first.
[02:19:44.680 --> 02:19:49.680]  And that's what they do. They make you sell it to them at discount and then slice it down to nothing.
[02:19:49.680 --> 02:19:56.680]  So you can get this book that was $24.99 for $14.69 out of the cage, talking to the dead with George Norrie.
[02:19:56.680 --> 02:20:05.680]  Stay with us. We'll be back with more of George Norrie.
[02:20:27.680 --> 02:20:32.680]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[02:20:32.680 --> 02:20:35.680]  The globalists are scared. They've overreached.
[02:20:35.680 --> 02:20:39.680]  The future of the info war is in your hands.

[02:22:33.680 --> 02:22:38.680]  there has never been a better time to make the switch to high efficiency LEDs.

[02:23:57.680 --> 02:24:02.680]  Okay, we're going to take a few calls in the next long segment with George Norrie.
[02:24:02.680 --> 02:24:07.680]  But I wanted to, well, ask George the question.
[02:24:07.680 --> 02:24:12.680]  I'm going to ask George the question.
[02:24:12.680 --> 02:24:17.680]  I'm going to ask George the question.
[02:24:17.680 --> 02:24:22.680]  I'm going to ask George the question.
[02:24:22.680 --> 02:24:27.680]  I'm going to ask George Norrie next long segment with George Norrie.
[02:24:27.680 --> 02:24:30.680]  But I wanted to, well, ask George the question.
[02:24:30.680 --> 02:24:33.680]  Here he was starting to get into this whole new world order system.
[02:24:33.680 --> 02:24:37.680]  And I agree with you. In fact, Brazinski admits they know the world's waking up to him.
[02:24:37.680 --> 02:24:42.680]  Where do you see this collision going between the forces of tyranny and liberty?
[02:24:42.680 --> 02:24:46.680]  We're going to have a world Alex of the haves and the have nots.
[02:24:46.680 --> 02:24:51.680]  And as that gap gets wider and wider and wider, we're going to have an implosion.
[02:24:51.680 --> 02:24:56.280]  People will get to a point, and it's close now, but it's not quite there.
[02:24:56.280 --> 02:25:00.580]  People will get to a point where they will say, enough is enough.
[02:25:00.580 --> 02:25:03.180]  We're tired of being taken advantage of.
[02:25:03.180 --> 02:25:06.080]  We're tired of getting the short end of the stick.
[02:25:06.080 --> 02:25:08.580]  All we want is what's fair.
[02:25:08.580 --> 02:25:12.880]  And I think anyone who is running for political office today
[02:25:12.880 --> 02:25:17.280]  should be and must be aware of the needs of Middle America
[02:25:17.280 --> 02:25:20.880]  or are headed for disaster.
[02:25:20.880 --> 02:25:22.280]  And it's happening.
[02:25:22.280 --> 02:25:23.380]  People are upset.
[02:25:23.380 --> 02:25:24.380]  I mean, you can see it.
[02:25:24.380 --> 02:25:25.780]  You can feel it on people.
[02:25:25.780 --> 02:25:28.580]  I mean, wherever you go, you talk to them.
[02:25:28.580 --> 02:25:29.580]  They're not happy.
[02:25:29.580 --> 02:25:30.580]  Nobody's happy.
[02:25:30.580 --> 02:25:36.980]  I've never seen a time ever where so many people were just unhappy.
[02:25:36.980 --> 02:25:39.080]  Why restaurants are full on weekends?
[02:25:39.080 --> 02:25:42.080]  Because people are so depressed, they're going out to drink.
[02:25:42.080 --> 02:25:46.180]  I mean, it's just something I have never, ever seen before.
[02:25:46.180 --> 02:25:50.980]  You know, I've been through, I was 13 when John Kennedy was assassinated.
[02:25:50.980 --> 02:25:53.080]  I went through the Vietnam War era.
[02:25:53.080 --> 02:25:58.280]  I've seen it all in my lifetime, but I've never seen a time like right now
[02:25:58.280 --> 02:26:01.980]  where more people are so whacked out and upset
[02:26:01.980 --> 02:26:04.580]  over what's been going on in all my life.
[02:26:04.580 --> 02:26:07.080]  And you see it too, don't you?
[02:26:07.080 --> 02:26:07.980]  Oh, of course.
[02:26:07.980 --> 02:26:12.380]  And every year it gets exponentially crazier
[02:26:12.380 --> 02:26:14.980]  and Homeland Security and this whole police state grid
[02:26:14.980 --> 02:26:17.880]  that is now admittedly for the American people,
[02:26:17.880 --> 02:26:21.180]  if the establishment thinks that that's going to keep us in line,
[02:26:21.180 --> 02:26:23.380]  they got another thing coming.
[02:26:23.380 --> 02:26:24.180]  Well, they sure do.
[02:26:24.180 --> 02:26:26.580]  I mean, already, you know, cities are beginning to wonder,
[02:26:26.580 --> 02:26:29.280]  oh, what did we do with these red light cameras?
[02:26:29.280 --> 02:26:30.480]  Why did we put them up?
[02:26:30.480 --> 02:26:32.180]  I think they're going to start coming down.
[02:26:32.180 --> 02:26:34.580]  Los Angeles is doing away with them.
[02:26:34.580 --> 02:26:38.180]  There's a lawsuit in a city near St. Louis.
[02:26:38.180 --> 02:26:42.380]  Most of Arizona took them down because people kept bashing them out.
[02:26:42.380 --> 02:26:45.080]  Well, you know, not only that, you know, studies have shown
[02:26:45.080 --> 02:26:48.580]  that they cause more accidents, you know,
[02:26:48.580 --> 02:26:52.080]  because people are so petrified of going through a red light
[02:26:52.080 --> 02:26:55.680]  that they will stop immediately and they get rear-ended.
[02:26:55.680 --> 02:26:57.980]  Well, they also got caught, as you know, in San Diego,
[02:26:57.980 --> 02:27:00.180]  shortening the yellow light.
[02:27:00.180 --> 02:27:02.180]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:27:02.180 --> 02:27:04.480]  I mean, it's amazing.
[02:27:04.480 --> 02:27:07.480]  I just wonder, though, if they're taking down the cameras,
[02:27:07.480 --> 02:27:09.180]  they may stop the practice,
[02:27:09.180 --> 02:27:12.180]  but what are the cameras still doing up there?
[02:27:12.180 --> 02:27:15.480]  But I think you just hit on something really positive, George.
[02:27:15.480 --> 02:27:17.680]  I'm seeing a lot of things reverse.
[02:27:17.680 --> 02:27:20.580]  I'm seeing, when I go out to demonstrate or something,
[02:27:20.580 --> 02:27:22.780]  instead of police acting like they hate us,
[02:27:22.780 --> 02:27:24.380]  I've been at Federal Reserve demonstrations
[02:27:24.380 --> 02:27:26.280]  where I'm yelling at the police or whatever,
[02:27:26.280 --> 02:27:28.580]  and they go, hey, buddy, turn your camera off,
[02:27:28.580 --> 02:27:30.880]  and the head guy goes, we know it's bad, we know.
[02:27:30.880 --> 02:27:32.080]  Listen, we're not bad.
[02:27:32.080 --> 02:27:35.480]  So more and more, I'm seeing people wake up.
[02:27:35.480 --> 02:27:39.880]  Alex, 95% of the police officers in this country are good people.
[02:27:39.880 --> 02:27:43.580]  They're like us, they're hardworking men and women,
[02:27:43.580 --> 02:27:46.680]  and they're put in the middle of all these situations.
[02:27:46.680 --> 02:27:49.480]  And of course, you've got that bad basket of apples.
[02:27:49.480 --> 02:27:51.680]  You have that in everything.
[02:27:51.680 --> 02:27:56.280]  It's with doctors, it's with lawyers, it's with all of them.
[02:27:56.280 --> 02:27:58.980]  Those are the people who get the ball to the publicity,
[02:27:58.980 --> 02:28:02.180]  the cops that beat up people that do stupid things.
[02:28:02.180 --> 02:28:05.980]  But by and large, I think it push comes to shove,
[02:28:05.980 --> 02:28:09.680]  Americans are going to defend Americans
[02:28:09.680 --> 02:28:11.080]  when they have to.
[02:28:11.080 --> 02:28:15.180]  And I just think that this world will wake up one day
[02:28:15.180 --> 02:28:17.980]  and they will say, enough is enough.
[02:28:17.980 --> 02:28:20.780]  We've seen what happened with the Arab Spring.
[02:28:20.780 --> 02:28:23.480]  We see what's happening in Greece right now.
[02:28:23.480 --> 02:28:26.680]  And believe me, it could happen here.
[02:28:26.680 --> 02:28:30.780]  And the Wall Street protests, that's nothing.
[02:28:30.780 --> 02:28:33.480]  You know, some of that is contrived, it's created.
[02:28:33.480 --> 02:28:36.580]  I'm talking about real, poor Americans
[02:28:36.580 --> 02:28:39.480]  who are fed up with being pushed around
[02:28:39.480 --> 02:28:41.280]  and we need to do something about that.
[02:28:41.280 --> 02:28:45.180]  This country should do something dramatically different
[02:28:45.180 --> 02:28:48.880]  with the way we tax people, do away with the IRS,
[02:28:48.880 --> 02:28:51.080]  go to some kind of fair use tax
[02:28:51.080 --> 02:28:54.980]  or something and give Americans close to 100%
[02:28:54.980 --> 02:28:56.680]  of the money to go out and earn.
[02:28:56.680 --> 02:28:59.880]  They're just tired and tired of people taking money away.
[02:28:59.880 --> 02:29:02.880]  I was talking to a very famous musician today,
[02:29:02.880 --> 02:29:05.480]  a household name, and he was describing how
[02:29:05.480 --> 02:29:07.680]  he only keeps about 20% of what he makes now
[02:29:07.680 --> 02:29:10.680]  after he pays all the lawyers and the fees and the fines
[02:29:10.680 --> 02:29:14.280]  and the taxes and he said, if this continues, you know,
[02:29:14.280 --> 02:29:16.180]  he knows a lot of other famous musicians.
[02:29:16.180 --> 02:29:17.580]  They're not even going to be able to make a living
[02:29:17.580 --> 02:29:19.080]  and people are like, wow, these guys,
[02:29:19.080 --> 02:29:20.480]  no, they used to be rich,
[02:29:20.480 --> 02:29:22.680]  but the taxes just go up and up and up
[02:29:22.680 --> 02:29:24.180]  where there's not going to be institutions
[02:29:24.180 --> 02:29:25.980]  to even hire people anymore.
[02:29:25.980 --> 02:29:28.080]  It's that race to the bottom, it's globalism.
[02:29:28.080 --> 02:29:31.580]  I want to talk more about Occupy Wall Street
[02:29:31.580 --> 02:29:32.880]  with George Norrie straight ahead.
[02:29:32.880 --> 02:29:35.880]  We'll take a few phone calls before he's got to leave us.
[02:29:35.880 --> 02:29:40.880]  We'll go to Eric and Kerry, Tim, and Tommy at least
[02:29:40.880 --> 02:29:42.280]  or George Norrie straight ahead
[02:29:42.280 --> 02:29:44.680]  and tell you a little bit more about his new book
[02:29:44.680 --> 02:29:47.180]  on its way to being a bestseller.
[02:29:47.180 --> 02:29:49.080]  Talking to the dead, it's out this week.
[02:29:50.180 --> 02:29:53.980]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.980 --> 02:29:56.980]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.780 --> 02:30:02.780]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons
[02:30:02.780 --> 02:30:05.280]  you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:05.280 --> 02:30:07.480]  Number one, new climate legislation
[02:30:07.480 --> 02:30:09.680]  could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:09.680 --> 02:30:11.780]  Number two, our new energy czar
[02:30:11.780 --> 02:30:13.380]  wants to control how much power
[02:30:13.380 --> 02:30:15.380]  your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:15.380 --> 02:30:18.280]  It's true, total government control of electricity
[02:30:18.280 --> 02:30:20.980]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:20.980 --> 02:30:23.280]  Number three, in some areas of the country
[02:30:23.280 --> 02:30:25.380]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:30:25.380 --> 02:30:27.680]  and now new socialist legislation
[02:30:27.680 --> 02:30:29.280]  is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:29.280 --> 02:30:31.480]  Number four, dangerous weather is always
[02:30:31.480 --> 02:30:32.880]  a threat to local grids.
[02:30:32.880 --> 02:30:35.180]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power
[02:30:35.180 --> 02:30:36.580]  from weather-related onages.
[02:30:36.580 --> 02:30:38.580]  Number five, a solar power generator
[02:30:38.580 --> 02:30:41.480]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:30:41.480 --> 02:30:43.580]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[02:30:43.580 --> 02:30:45.180]  offered by Solutions from Science.
[02:30:45.180 --> 02:30:46.580]  One of my oldest sponsors.
[02:30:46.580 --> 02:30:50.780]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:50.780 --> 02:30:52.480]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:52.480 --> 02:30:54.780]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:30:54.780 --> 02:30:56.680]  So go to mysolarbackup.com
[02:30:56.680 --> 02:31:00.680]  or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:31:00.680 --> 02:31:03.680]  Steve Shank here with a special alert from eFoods Direct.
[02:31:03.680 --> 02:31:06.780]  The stock market continues to crash and re-crash daily.
[02:31:06.780 --> 02:31:09.080]  Since July, the market has dropped 15%
[02:31:09.080 --> 02:31:10.580]  with no signs of recovery.
[02:31:10.580 --> 02:31:11.680]  What does that mean to you?
[02:31:11.680 --> 02:31:13.780]  When stocks crash, jobs are lost
[02:31:13.780 --> 02:31:16.780]  and you can't buy the food that's already too expensive
[02:31:16.780 --> 02:31:18.480]  and continues to raise in cost.
[02:31:18.480 --> 02:31:20.680]  eFoods just got noticed that wholesale costs
[02:31:20.680 --> 02:31:24.180]  on pasta, rice, and beans will immediately jump 20%.
[02:31:24.180 --> 02:31:26.580]  The already high cost of sugar is tripling.
[02:31:26.580 --> 02:31:28.980]  If you invest in the stock market for security
[02:31:28.980 --> 02:31:30.280]  or save money in the bank,
[02:31:30.280 --> 02:31:32.680]  you continue to see the dollar drop in value
[02:31:32.680 --> 02:31:34.680]  while your weekly food bills increase.
[02:31:34.680 --> 02:31:35.880]  So what are you going to do?
[02:31:35.880 --> 02:31:37.780]  Get as much food now as you can.
[02:31:37.780 --> 02:31:39.380]  With these problems you're facing,
[02:31:39.380 --> 02:31:41.080]  eFoods Direct has no choice
[02:31:41.080 --> 02:31:44.280]  but to extend the free shipping another week to October 9th.
[02:31:44.280 --> 02:31:46.880]  Free shipping buys more food with shipping dollars.
[02:31:46.880 --> 02:31:49.880]  Call 800-409-5633
[02:31:49.880 --> 02:31:52.480]  or go to eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.
[02:31:52.480 --> 02:31:55.280]  Call 800-409-5633
[02:31:55.280 --> 02:31:57.780]  or eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.
[02:31:57.780 --> 02:32:00.280]  You can bet your life on eFoods Direct.
[02:32:00.280 --> 02:32:03.180]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones.
[02:32:03.180 --> 02:32:06.280]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings,
[02:32:06.280 --> 02:32:08.380]  opportunity, and recognized risk.
[02:32:08.380 --> 02:32:10.080]  Saving means to make money.
[02:32:10.080 --> 02:32:13.480]  The Calben Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars
[02:32:13.480 --> 02:32:15.780]  and give you good old-fashioned real soaps
[02:32:15.780 --> 02:32:17.180]  that are triple concentrated
[02:32:17.180 --> 02:32:19.480]  and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:32:19.480 --> 02:32:22.280]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils
[02:32:22.280 --> 02:32:24.480]  that contain no useless dyes,
[02:32:24.480 --> 02:32:27.080]  perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:32:27.080 --> 02:32:30.280]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents
[02:32:30.280 --> 02:32:32.780]  that give you rashes, itching sores,
[02:32:32.780 --> 02:32:35.080]  and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:32:35.080 --> 02:32:36.280]  If you want something better,
[02:32:36.280 --> 02:32:38.280]  if you want something you've never had before,
[02:32:38.280 --> 02:32:40.380]  you have to do something you've never done before.
[02:32:40.380 --> 02:32:42.080]  Getting a free catalog is easy
[02:32:42.080 --> 02:32:45.280]  by calling 800-340-7091
[02:32:45.280 --> 02:32:48.480]  or see Calben on the Web at 5starsoap.com.
[02:32:48.480 --> 02:32:50.280]  Take charge of your health now
[02:32:50.280 --> 02:32:53.480]  by calling 800-340-7091
[02:32:53.480 --> 02:32:57.480]  or see Calben on the Web at 5starsoap.com.
[02:33:01.480 --> 02:33:04.480]  I remember when, I remember, I remember,
[02:33:04.480 --> 02:33:07.480]  when I lost my mind.
[02:33:07.480 --> 02:33:10.980]  There was something so pleasant about that place.
[02:33:10.980 --> 02:33:15.480]  Even your emotions have an echo in so much space.
[02:33:18.480 --> 02:33:21.480]  And when you out there without care,
[02:33:21.480 --> 02:33:25.480]  in the beginning a patriot is a scarce man
[02:33:25.480 --> 02:33:27.480]  hated and feared and scorned.
[02:33:27.480 --> 02:33:29.480]  But in time when his cause succeeds,
[02:33:29.480 --> 02:33:31.480]  the timid join him because then it costs nothing
[02:33:31.480 --> 02:33:32.480]  to be a patriot.
[02:33:32.480 --> 02:33:34.480]  You can certainly say that about George Norrie.
[02:33:34.480 --> 02:33:37.480]  Here's another quote, Thomas Jefferson,
[02:33:37.480 --> 02:33:39.480]  enlighten the people generally,
[02:33:39.480 --> 02:33:41.480]  and tyranny and oppressions of body and mind
[02:33:41.480 --> 02:33:44.480]  will vanish like phantoms at dawn,
[02:33:44.480 --> 02:33:46.480]  coast to coast, a-m dot com,
[02:33:46.480 --> 02:33:49.480]  coast to coast, a-m dot com.
[02:33:49.480 --> 02:33:52.480]  Is that the best website, George, for people to visit?
[02:33:52.480 --> 02:33:54.480]  Yeah, it sure is.
[02:33:54.480 --> 02:33:56.480]  I've asked them to try to get other domains
[02:33:56.480 --> 02:33:59.480]  that tie us and link us straight into coast to coast.
[02:33:59.480 --> 02:34:01.480]  But you've got to put the TO
[02:34:01.480 --> 02:34:04.480]  in the middle of coast to coast a-m dot com.
[02:34:04.480 --> 02:34:06.480]  I've always told people, Alex,
[02:34:06.480 --> 02:34:09.480]  make it one of your favorites on your computer
[02:34:09.480 --> 02:34:12.480]  so you don't have to type it up all the time.
[02:34:12.480 --> 02:34:13.480]  Because, you know, that's growing too.
[02:34:13.480 --> 02:34:16.480]  But yeah, I mean, your websites, infowars.com
[02:34:16.480 --> 02:34:19.480]  and prisonplanet.com, they're huge.
[02:34:19.480 --> 02:34:21.480]  I mean, they're absolutely huge.
[02:34:21.480 --> 02:34:26.480]  I get calls every other day from people about you.
[02:34:26.480 --> 02:34:29.480]  I get emails about you.
[02:34:29.480 --> 02:34:30.480]  Enough about me, George.
[02:34:30.480 --> 02:34:31.480]  We got you on here.
[02:34:31.480 --> 02:34:34.480]  I want to talk to you, but speaking of that,
[02:34:34.480 --> 02:34:35.480]  I heard you just mentioning that.
[02:34:35.480 --> 02:34:38.480]  Obviously, the execs on the big network you're on
[02:34:38.480 --> 02:34:40.480]  know that you're talented,
[02:34:40.480 --> 02:34:43.480]  want Emmy Award-winning news producer from TV,
[02:34:43.480 --> 02:34:45.480]  all this stuff.
[02:34:45.480 --> 02:34:47.480]  But at the same time, all they've got to do
[02:34:47.480 --> 02:34:49.480]  is create a simpler domain
[02:34:49.480 --> 02:34:51.480]  that will also point at that one.
[02:34:51.480 --> 02:34:53.480]  And I would bet that would probably increase your traffic
[02:34:53.480 --> 02:34:55.480]  by 30%.
[02:34:55.480 --> 02:34:57.480]  That's conservative.
[02:34:57.480 --> 02:34:59.480]  And I heard you just kind of throw that out there.
[02:34:59.480 --> 02:35:02.480]  But you guys have got to create a simpler domain.
[02:35:02.480 --> 02:35:03.480]  Absolutely.
[02:35:03.480 --> 02:35:05.480]  I think, for example, try it out for me.
[02:35:05.480 --> 02:35:06.480]  I haven't.
[02:35:06.480 --> 02:35:08.480]  If you do George Norrie,
[02:35:08.480 --> 02:35:10.480]  n-o-o-r-y, GeorgeNorrie.com,
[02:35:10.480 --> 02:35:13.480]  I think it takes you straight to our website as well.
[02:35:13.480 --> 02:35:16.480]  Well, that's good then. I'm not getting off into Radio Land.
[02:35:16.480 --> 02:35:18.480]  I can learn a lot more from you than you can learn from me,
[02:35:18.480 --> 02:35:20.480]  but you obviously already know that.
[02:35:20.480 --> 02:35:23.480]  I want to go to a few calls here in the time we have for you.
[02:35:23.480 --> 02:35:25.480]  George, is there anything else before I go to calls?
[02:35:25.480 --> 02:35:28.480]  Because I know you've got to leave soon that you'd like to add.
[02:35:28.480 --> 02:35:30.480]  Well, I just want everybody to know, Alex,
[02:35:30.480 --> 02:35:33.480]  that even though it seems like
[02:35:33.480 --> 02:35:36.480]  we are in the middle of all this mess,
[02:35:36.480 --> 02:35:39.480]  I am still extremely positive
[02:35:39.480 --> 02:35:42.480]  about the long-term future of America
[02:35:42.480 --> 02:35:44.480]  and of its people.
[02:35:44.480 --> 02:35:46.480]  We're going to go through some incredible times.
[02:35:46.480 --> 02:35:49.480]  We may go through some world wars,
[02:35:49.480 --> 02:35:51.480]  but I still think in the end,
[02:35:51.480 --> 02:35:54.480]  humanity is going to make it in one day.
[02:35:54.480 --> 02:35:57.480]  One day, this will be a better place for everybody.
[02:35:57.480 --> 02:35:59.480]  Well, no doubt, things have to get bad
[02:35:59.480 --> 02:36:01.480]  before people start to appreciate true freedom again.
[02:36:01.480 --> 02:36:03.480]  Let's talk to Kerry and Georgia.
[02:36:03.480 --> 02:36:05.480]  You're on the air with George Norrie, Kerry.
[02:36:05.480 --> 02:36:07.480]  Hey, Alex. Hey, George.
[02:36:07.480 --> 02:36:11.480]  I wanted to tell you, thank you, George.
[02:36:11.480 --> 02:36:14.480]  I have been trying to get through my dad.
[02:36:14.480 --> 02:36:17.480]  He's 68 years old. I've been trying to wake him up.
[02:36:17.480 --> 02:36:20.480]  And I tell you the morning that he called me,
[02:36:20.480 --> 02:36:24.480]  he says, have you ever listened to this guy, George Norrie?
[02:36:24.480 --> 02:36:27.480]  And I said, I knew that I had gotten through to him,
[02:36:27.480 --> 02:36:30.480]  and it was because of your program.
[02:36:30.480 --> 02:36:32.480]  Well, thank you.
[02:36:32.480 --> 02:36:35.480]  So many family members, Kerry and Alex,
[02:36:35.480 --> 02:36:38.480]  have gotten together now as a group.
[02:36:38.480 --> 02:36:41.480]  That's a family, the son, the father,
[02:36:41.480 --> 02:36:43.480]  and they start listening to Coast to Coast.
[02:36:43.480 --> 02:36:46.480]  And it's something that allows them to talk
[02:36:46.480 --> 02:36:48.480]  and get closer to each other.
[02:36:48.480 --> 02:36:50.480]  It's a really great feeling for me
[02:36:50.480 --> 02:36:53.480]  to know that this program is touching so many lives,
[02:36:53.480 --> 02:36:57.480]  whether it's alternative medicine or conspiracy theories,
[02:36:57.480 --> 02:36:59.480]  or you name it.
[02:36:59.480 --> 02:37:02.480]  And really, I'm having a time of my life doing it.
[02:37:02.480 --> 02:37:04.480]  So thank you. I appreciate it.
[02:37:04.480 --> 02:37:08.480]  George, you know what Superman's uncle tells him,
[02:37:08.480 --> 02:37:10.480]  with great power comes great responsibility.
[02:37:10.480 --> 02:37:12.480]  I've learned the responsibility of having
[02:37:12.480 --> 02:37:14.480]  three million listeners a day.
[02:37:14.480 --> 02:37:16.480]  What's it like to have 16 million or more?
[02:37:16.480 --> 02:37:18.480]  I mean, that is quite a responsibility.
[02:37:18.480 --> 02:37:20.480]  Alex, I'll let you in on a little secret.
[02:37:20.480 --> 02:37:23.480]  I broadcast to one person every night.
[02:37:23.480 --> 02:37:26.480]  And when you do that, when you do that,
[02:37:26.480 --> 02:37:28.480]  you touch everybody.
[02:37:28.480 --> 02:37:30.480]  So I don't think how many people are listening.
[02:37:30.480 --> 02:37:33.480]  Because if I did, I'd probably lose it and go crazy.
[02:37:33.480 --> 02:37:37.480]  You've got to broadcast just the one person,
[02:37:37.480 --> 02:37:41.480]  touch that one person, and you'll see the difference.
[02:37:41.480 --> 02:37:43.480]  Imagine how many sports stadiums
[02:37:43.480 --> 02:37:47.480]  of 100,000 people is 16 million.
[02:37:47.480 --> 02:37:49.480]  I mean, that is incredible.
[02:37:49.480 --> 02:37:51.480]  I think about speaking to millions,
[02:37:51.480 --> 02:37:53.480]  and it's like, wow, we're making a film
[02:37:53.480 --> 02:37:55.480]  that's watched by 30 million people.
[02:37:55.480 --> 02:37:57.480]  It's incredible.
[02:37:57.480 --> 02:38:00.480]  Did you want to ask any questions, Carrie, before we jump?
[02:38:00.480 --> 02:38:04.480]  Well, I just had a couple of interesting things
[02:38:04.480 --> 02:38:06.480]  I wanted to ask you about.
[02:38:06.480 --> 02:38:11.480]  Mostly how you see Darrell Issa and Chuck Grassley.
[02:38:11.480 --> 02:38:14.480]  You'll hear them talking about Eric Holder
[02:38:14.480 --> 02:38:17.480]  and the five memos of July 2010.
[02:38:17.480 --> 02:38:19.480]  But you never hear anybody mention
[02:38:19.480 --> 02:38:23.480]  that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act
[02:38:23.480 --> 02:38:26.480]  had $10 million of funding for Gun Runner and is.
[02:38:26.480 --> 02:38:28.480]  And you never hear anybody talk about
[02:38:28.480 --> 02:38:30.480]  the Department of Homeland Security.
[02:38:30.480 --> 02:38:32.480]  But, see, you just dropped a bombshell.
[02:38:32.480 --> 02:38:33.480]  I knew that months ago,
[02:38:33.480 --> 02:38:35.480]  and had even forgotten to do a piece on it.
[02:38:35.480 --> 02:38:39.480]  The American Reinvestment Act had $10 million in it,
[02:38:39.480 --> 02:38:40.480]  and it's come out in testimony.
[02:38:40.480 --> 02:38:42.480]  The White House was running this.
[02:38:42.480 --> 02:38:44.480]  Holder's been caught lying.
[02:38:44.480 --> 02:38:47.480]  Now we learn it's cocaine into the U.S.
[02:38:47.480 --> 02:38:49.480]  for guns to send a loa.
[02:38:49.480 --> 02:38:51.480]  The big cartel, George Norris, that's a great question.
[02:38:51.480 --> 02:38:53.480]  What's your view on this fast and furious?
[02:38:53.480 --> 02:38:56.480]  Is this Obama's Waterloo?
[02:38:56.480 --> 02:38:59.480]  It may be if it continues to grow and fester.
[02:38:59.480 --> 02:39:01.480]  Bottom line, Alex, this has been going on
[02:39:01.480 --> 02:39:04.480]  for a long, long time.
[02:39:04.480 --> 02:39:07.480]  Years ago, I had Daniel Ellsberg on the program,
[02:39:07.480 --> 02:39:09.480]  Pentagon Papers.
[02:39:09.480 --> 02:39:12.480]  He was the one who pointed out and showed everybody
[02:39:12.480 --> 02:39:15.480]  how Lyndon Johnson lied about everything
[02:39:15.480 --> 02:39:17.480]  of the Vietnam War.
[02:39:17.480 --> 02:39:22.480]  Governments generally lie to its population.
[02:39:22.480 --> 02:39:24.480]  It's a sad fact.
[02:39:24.480 --> 02:39:27.480]  I don't know what happens to honest politicians
[02:39:27.480 --> 02:39:30.480]  when they get into office, but something happens to them,
[02:39:30.480 --> 02:39:35.480]  and they begin to do things that are just unbelievable.
[02:39:35.480 --> 02:39:40.480]  And in this particular case, if the media stays on it,
[02:39:40.480 --> 02:39:44.480]  Holder will probably get tossed out as the Attorney General,
[02:39:44.480 --> 02:39:46.480]  and who knows what it would do
[02:39:46.480 --> 02:39:48.480]  for President Obama's administration.
[02:39:48.480 --> 02:39:50.480]  Well, George, I've talked a lot of high-level people.
[02:39:50.480 --> 02:39:52.480]  What happens is, whatever your fancy is,
[02:39:52.480 --> 02:39:54.480]  it shows up with a bow on it,
[02:39:54.480 --> 02:39:57.480]  whether it's money, power, or a beautiful woman,
[02:39:57.480 --> 02:39:59.480]  and they just compromise these people.
[02:39:59.480 --> 02:40:01.480]  Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts, absolutely.
[02:40:01.480 --> 02:40:03.480]  George has got to go here in just a few minutes.
[02:40:03.480 --> 02:40:05.480]  Let's take another call.
[02:40:05.480 --> 02:40:07.480]  Tommy and Tennessee are on the air with George Norrie.
[02:40:07.480 --> 02:40:09.480]  Hey, George. Hey, Alex. How are you doing?
[02:40:09.480 --> 02:40:11.480]  Good. Good, Tommy.
[02:40:11.480 --> 02:40:14.480]  First of all, I'd like to say that the wife and I
[02:40:14.480 --> 02:40:16.480]  go into a prayer of agreement every night
[02:40:16.480 --> 02:40:19.480]  and every morning for the protection of the crew,
[02:40:19.480 --> 02:40:23.480]  you guys, and Ron Paul's family.
[02:40:23.480 --> 02:40:26.480]  And also, are you there?
[02:40:26.480 --> 02:40:28.480]  Yes, sir. I appreciate the prayer.
[02:40:28.480 --> 02:40:29.480]  Okay.
[02:40:29.480 --> 02:40:32.480]  And also, George, one of my favorite episodes of yours
[02:40:32.480 --> 02:40:37.480]  was Patrick Herron on May 4th on the third hour.
[02:40:37.480 --> 02:40:42.480]  And we keep hearing about the global government.
[02:40:42.480 --> 02:40:47.480]  We keep hearing about the global economy.
[02:40:47.480 --> 02:40:51.480]  Well, now Rick Warren is talking about the global religion
[02:40:51.480 --> 02:40:54.480]  that is made by Bill Clinton and Tony Blair.
[02:40:54.480 --> 02:40:56.480]  It's called Chris Warren.
[02:40:56.480 --> 02:40:59.480]  And I was wondering if one of you would do a segment.
[02:40:59.480 --> 02:41:01.480]  Yeah. Oprah Winfrey.
[02:41:01.480 --> 02:41:02.480]  I think she's a nice lady.
[02:41:02.480 --> 02:41:03.480]  I think she's deceived.
[02:41:03.480 --> 02:41:06.480]  She's funding some New Agey church system.
[02:41:06.480 --> 02:41:08.480]  The UN says they want a world religion.
[02:41:08.480 --> 02:41:09.480]  George?
[02:41:09.480 --> 02:41:13.480]  Well, I have not been a proponent of organized religion.
[02:41:13.480 --> 02:41:15.480]  Alex, you know, I'm a believer in God.
[02:41:15.480 --> 02:41:17.480]  Trust me there.
[02:41:17.480 --> 02:41:20.480]  And I think everybody has that God-given right
[02:41:20.480 --> 02:41:22.480]  to practice and worship the way they want.
[02:41:22.480 --> 02:41:25.480]  But I've just never been a fan of organized religion.
[02:41:25.480 --> 02:41:28.480]  I mean, I've seen what the churches have done.
[02:41:28.480 --> 02:41:31.480]  I've seen what they've tried to do for money.
[02:41:31.480 --> 02:41:37.480]  It's just something that I feel we don't need as individuals.
[02:41:37.480 --> 02:41:39.480]  Pray and practice within yourself.
[02:41:39.480 --> 02:41:41.480]  You can reach your God that way.
[02:41:41.480 --> 02:41:45.480]  And it's, you know what, less cost-effectively.
[02:41:45.480 --> 02:41:46.480]  Absolutely.
[02:41:46.480 --> 02:41:48.480]  Thank you so much, Tommy.
[02:41:48.480 --> 02:41:50.480]  Let's do one more and I'll continue with your calls
[02:41:50.480 --> 02:41:52.480]  if we're George's got to go though.
[02:41:52.480 --> 02:41:54.480]  When do you get shut out, George?
[02:41:54.480 --> 02:41:56.480]  Well, I'll take a little nap after this
[02:41:56.480 --> 02:41:59.480]  and then I'll be ready to go again for another 12-hour day
[02:41:59.480 --> 02:42:01.480]  on Coast to Coast A.M.
[02:42:01.480 --> 02:42:03.480]  Last call for George.
[02:42:03.480 --> 02:42:05.480]  Let's talk to Matt in Ohio.
[02:42:05.480 --> 02:42:07.480]  Matt, you're on the air.
[02:42:07.480 --> 02:42:09.480]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:42:09.480 --> 02:42:11.480]  I just had a quick comment
[02:42:11.480 --> 02:42:13.480]  and kind of wanted to get your take on it.
[02:42:13.480 --> 02:42:16.480]  I think we're really to a tipping point
[02:42:16.480 --> 02:42:19.480]  and to George's point earlier
[02:42:19.480 --> 02:42:23.480]  that people really seem kind of maybe depressed
[02:42:23.480 --> 02:42:26.480]  or just perhaps impotent.
[02:42:26.480 --> 02:42:29.480]  But I think we're right around the corner politically.
[02:42:29.480 --> 02:42:31.480]  Once people, because we're reaching a point
[02:42:31.480 --> 02:42:33.480]  where the vast majority of people want
[02:42:33.480 --> 02:42:36.480]  some of the same changes politically,
[02:42:36.480 --> 02:42:38.480]  the vast majority want to end the wars
[02:42:38.480 --> 02:42:41.480]  and draw down troops to some level or another
[02:42:41.480 --> 02:42:43.480]  to stop the violence on the border,
[02:42:43.480 --> 02:42:45.480]  the Southwestern border,
[02:42:45.480 --> 02:42:47.480]  and the domination of special interests
[02:42:47.480 --> 02:42:49.480]  over the government and forced criminal laws
[02:42:49.480 --> 02:42:51.480]  on government agents.
[02:42:51.480 --> 02:42:53.480]  And as we push back against the elite,
[02:42:53.480 --> 02:42:55.480]  they get more and more clownish
[02:42:55.480 --> 02:42:57.480]  in their attempt to dominate us.
[02:42:57.480 --> 02:42:59.480]  I see it backfiring.
[02:42:59.480 --> 02:43:02.480]  What's your specific question then for George?
[02:43:02.480 --> 02:43:06.480]  Do you think we're ready to start identifying
[02:43:06.480 --> 02:43:09.480]  where we agree and then just throwing our entire weight
[02:43:09.480 --> 02:43:12.480]  behind these, at least the areas where we agree
[02:43:12.480 --> 02:43:14.480]  so we can start getting, you know,
[02:43:14.480 --> 02:43:16.480]  political effectiveness back in the country?
[02:43:16.480 --> 02:43:18.480]  I think that's a good final question for George Noray.
[02:43:18.480 --> 02:43:19.480]  George?
[02:43:19.480 --> 02:43:21.480]  One of my favorite lines from the movie network
[02:43:21.480 --> 02:43:24.480]  from Howard Beale played by the late Peter French was
[02:43:24.480 --> 02:43:26.480]  just leave us alone.
[02:43:26.480 --> 02:43:28.480]  Leave us with our toasters and our radio tires
[02:43:28.480 --> 02:43:30.480]  and our televisions.
[02:43:30.480 --> 02:43:32.480]  Just leave us alone, please.
[02:43:32.480 --> 02:43:34.480]  But then he stopped and said,
[02:43:34.480 --> 02:43:37.480]  I'm as mad as hell, I'm not going to take it anymore.
[02:43:37.480 --> 02:43:39.480]  And I think that's what's happening to people
[02:43:39.480 --> 02:43:41.480]  around this planet.
[02:43:41.480 --> 02:43:44.480]  They're as mad as hell, they're not going to take it anymore.
[02:43:44.480 --> 02:43:48.480]  And governments worldwide should be very aware of that
[02:43:48.480 --> 02:43:51.480]  and start realizing that people come first.
[02:43:51.480 --> 02:43:53.480]  Well, the globalist, George,
[02:43:53.480 --> 02:43:55.480]  would love that if we just blew up
[02:43:55.480 --> 02:43:57.480]  and directed it at capitalism,
[02:43:57.480 --> 02:44:00.480]  like the guy worth $200 million
[02:44:00.480 --> 02:44:02.480]  wants us to do, Michael Moore,
[02:44:02.480 --> 02:44:04.480]  because the bankers want collectivism
[02:44:04.480 --> 02:44:06.480]  and knock out their competition, as you know.
[02:44:06.480 --> 02:44:08.480]  They don't want us to get focused and peacefully take
[02:44:08.480 --> 02:44:10.480]  our government's back or if it explodes,
[02:44:10.480 --> 02:44:12.480]  actually go after the power elite.
[02:44:12.480 --> 02:44:14.480]  I think they've miscalculated.
[02:44:14.480 --> 02:44:16.480]  And I don't see the arrogance in their eyes anymore.
[02:44:16.480 --> 02:44:19.480]  I see scrabbling rat-like fear.
[02:44:19.480 --> 02:44:21.480]  They don't want martial law.
[02:44:21.480 --> 02:44:25.480]  They don't want to have to pull out the police force.
[02:44:25.480 --> 02:44:27.480]  They don't want to have to do that
[02:44:27.480 --> 02:44:30.480]  because they know we will win if that happens.
[02:44:30.480 --> 02:44:33.480]  And they're petrified that this is all going to be done
[02:44:33.480 --> 02:44:37.480]  and there's nothing they can do to stop us once we get going.
[02:44:37.480 --> 02:44:39.480]  People are fed up, Alex.
[02:44:39.480 --> 02:44:42.480]  And, you know, I've been an advocate of peaceful protest
[02:44:42.480 --> 02:44:44.480]  all my life.
[02:44:44.480 --> 02:44:46.480]  I hope things continue.
[02:44:46.480 --> 02:44:48.480]  And maybe one day the globalists will say,
[02:44:48.480 --> 02:44:50.480]  you know what, enough is enough.
[02:44:50.480 --> 02:44:52.480]  We're going to go back to our little mansions
[02:44:52.480 --> 02:44:54.480]  and live our own peaceful little life.
[02:44:54.480 --> 02:44:56.480]  You people can have your own destiny.
[02:44:56.480 --> 02:44:59.480]  We're out of it.
[02:44:59.480 --> 02:45:04.480]  George, we're getting a little bit of feedback here at the end
[02:45:04.480 --> 02:45:05.480]  talking to you.
[02:45:05.480 --> 02:45:07.480]  We have some new folks running the show today.
[02:45:07.480 --> 02:45:09.480]  I'm not exactly sure what's going on.
[02:45:09.480 --> 02:45:12.480]  But in closing, what do you think of the idea
[02:45:12.480 --> 02:45:15.480]  I've got to go and protest the Federal Reserve itself
[02:45:15.480 --> 02:45:17.480]  instead of just capitalism?
[02:45:17.480 --> 02:45:20.480]  I think you can protest and you have to do it.
[02:45:20.480 --> 02:45:21.480]  You know what?
[02:45:21.480 --> 02:45:24.480]  Thomas Jefferson once said that when we lose control
[02:45:24.480 --> 02:45:26.480]  of our nation and our currency,
[02:45:26.480 --> 02:45:32.480]  we've lost it, we've got to be able to get that back.
[02:45:32.480 --> 02:45:34.480]  Well, George, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:45:34.480 --> 02:45:36.480]  I look forward to talking to you in the near future.
[02:45:36.480 --> 02:45:38.480]  OK, Alex, my friend, be well.
[02:45:38.480 --> 02:45:39.480]  Keep doing what you're doing.
[02:45:39.480 --> 02:45:40.480]  America loves you.
[02:45:40.480 --> 02:45:42.480]  Well, we love you too, George.
[02:45:42.480 --> 02:45:43.480]  Take care, my friend.
[02:45:43.480 --> 02:45:45.480]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:45:45.480 --> 02:45:47.480]  we're going to get Luke Radowski on here with us
[02:45:47.480 --> 02:45:50.480]  in just a moment to give us an update
[02:45:50.480 --> 02:45:53.480]  on exactly what happened to him.
[02:45:53.480 --> 02:45:56.480]  Just to let Genesis know, I'm told we're not going
[02:45:56.480 --> 02:45:57.480]  to the network right now.
[02:45:57.480 --> 02:45:59.480]  That has not happened in years.
[02:45:59.480 --> 02:46:01.480]  And of course, it happened today.
[02:46:01.480 --> 02:46:05.480]  So we will attempt to find out exactly what's going on
[02:46:05.480 --> 02:46:10.480]  up there on their end.
[02:46:10.480 --> 02:46:14.480]  OK, so we're here.
[02:46:14.480 --> 02:46:16.480]  That'll certainly add to conspiracy theories
[02:46:16.480 --> 02:46:21.480]  of what was going on there with George Norrie
[02:46:21.480 --> 02:46:25.480]  at the end of that interview.
[02:46:25.480 --> 02:46:28.480]  Oh, God.
[02:46:28.480 --> 02:46:29.480]  Let's go to Luke Radowski.
[02:46:29.480 --> 02:46:31.480]  Luke, we've been trying to get a hold of you
[02:46:31.480 --> 02:46:32.480]  since last night.
[02:46:32.480 --> 02:46:34.480]  Tell us what happened, because Rob Jacobson was there
[02:46:34.480 --> 02:46:35.480]  and the next he knew.
[02:46:35.480 --> 02:46:41.480]  You'd let a bunch of people down to the Federal Reserve,
[02:46:41.480 --> 02:46:42.480]  which was a great idea.
[02:46:42.480 --> 02:46:45.480]  And what happened to you?
[02:46:45.480 --> 02:46:46.480]  I was out there reporting everything
[02:46:46.480 --> 02:46:47.480]  that was happening last night.
[02:46:47.480 --> 02:46:49.480]  Last day was a crazy incredible day
[02:46:49.480 --> 02:46:51.480]  with thousands and thousands.
[02:46:51.480 --> 02:46:54.480]  I've never seen such a huge rally of people in New York City
[02:46:54.480 --> 02:46:56.480]  as I did yesterday.
[02:46:56.480 --> 02:46:58.480]  We were filming another march that took place
[02:46:58.480 --> 02:47:00.480]  after the major march just took place
[02:47:00.480 --> 02:47:02.480]  where people were trying to walk down peacefully,
[02:47:02.480 --> 02:47:04.480]  nonviolently down to Wall Street.
[02:47:04.480 --> 02:47:07.480]  The police, of course, overreacted as they always do
[02:47:07.480 --> 02:47:08.480]  instead of police barricades,
[02:47:08.480 --> 02:47:10.480]  instead of police horses, police scooters,
[02:47:10.480 --> 02:47:13.480]  running over people everywhere, blocking people off,
[02:47:13.480 --> 02:47:15.480]  because some people even estimate that there was
[02:47:15.480 --> 02:47:18.480]  over 20,000 people in New York City.
[02:47:18.480 --> 02:47:23.480]  So they allowed a small number of protesters to go through
[02:47:23.480 --> 02:47:24.480]  to try to get into Wall Street,
[02:47:24.480 --> 02:47:26.480]  and they blocked off the streets,
[02:47:26.480 --> 02:47:29.480]  and the remainder of the crowd was left in Liberty Park.
[02:47:29.480 --> 02:47:32.480]  Now, the small amount of protesters,
[02:47:32.480 --> 02:47:34.480]  which was still a large amount,
[02:47:34.480 --> 02:47:36.480]  but it compared to the other one,
[02:47:36.480 --> 02:47:40.480]  was brought in there, stopped immediately,
[02:47:40.480 --> 02:47:42.480]  and then some protesters decided
[02:47:42.480 --> 02:47:44.480]  that they just want to peacefully walk
[02:47:44.480 --> 02:47:47.480]  and that they were going to try to move across the barricades,
[02:47:47.480 --> 02:47:49.480]  and when that happened, all chaos broke loose,
[02:47:49.480 --> 02:47:53.480]  and you see the video from right there on our YouTube channel.
[02:47:56.480 --> 02:47:59.480]  So they were running mopeds into people.
[02:47:59.480 --> 02:48:03.480]  Last night was an incredible, insane day.
[02:48:03.480 --> 02:48:05.480]  Most of the action even took place
[02:48:05.480 --> 02:48:07.480]  after the major incident that I filmed
[02:48:07.480 --> 02:48:09.480]  where other protesters who walked around
[02:48:09.480 --> 02:48:12.480]  the original police barricades tried to come on
[02:48:12.480 --> 02:48:13.480]  and help people.
[02:48:13.480 --> 02:48:18.480]  There were horses that the NYPD was running at people.
[02:48:18.480 --> 02:48:20.480]  People had to run away from horses.
[02:48:20.480 --> 02:48:22.480]  NYPD were beating people
[02:48:22.480 --> 02:48:25.480]  if they would even step one foot on the street,
[02:48:25.480 --> 02:48:28.480]  and I heard people got run over with scooters,
[02:48:28.480 --> 02:48:31.480]  people got thrown, beat up violently,
[02:48:31.480 --> 02:48:33.480]  just for trying to peacefully demonstrate
[02:48:33.480 --> 02:48:35.480]  in the United States of America.
[02:48:35.480 --> 02:48:38.480]  And specifically, what happened to you?
[02:48:38.480 --> 02:48:41.480]  Well, I was out there filming the whole incident,
[02:48:41.480 --> 02:48:45.480]  and I clearly have two press badges, press identifications,
[02:48:45.480 --> 02:48:49.480]  one even from DCPD stating I'm a press,
[02:48:49.480 --> 02:48:52.480]  and I was there with the Fox News guys right next to me.
[02:48:52.480 --> 02:48:54.480]  We were filming exactly what was happening,
[02:48:54.480 --> 02:48:57.480]  and then tear gas gets sprayed at us,
[02:48:57.480 --> 02:48:59.480]  as soon as the tear gas gets sprayed at us,
[02:48:59.480 --> 02:49:02.480]  all chaos breaks loose, police officers are just swinging
[02:49:02.480 --> 02:49:05.480]  at the times like it was a baseball bat.
[02:49:05.480 --> 02:49:08.480]  It was just insane.
[02:49:08.480 --> 02:49:12.480]  And then one police officer comes, puts the side stick sideways,
[02:49:12.480 --> 02:49:14.480]  and just spears me in the middle of the gut.
[02:49:14.480 --> 02:49:17.480]  Now, what you don't see in that video is me grabbing my stomach,
[02:49:17.480 --> 02:49:20.480]  and as I grabbed my stomach, I had another police officer
[02:49:20.480 --> 02:49:24.480]  just forcefully throw me onto the floor,
[02:49:24.480 --> 02:49:28.480]  and me and the other Fox News crew landed on top of each other
[02:49:28.480 --> 02:49:33.480]  in utter chaos, where we got stepped on, I think, even kicked.
[02:49:33.480 --> 02:49:37.480]  As I got up to film again, another protestor was thrown,
[02:49:37.480 --> 02:49:39.480]  and more people were falling all over the place.
[02:49:39.480 --> 02:49:42.480]  We got the whole video live streaming on our phones,
[02:49:42.480 --> 02:49:45.480]  so you could see the live streaming on our YouTube,
[02:49:45.480 --> 02:49:47.480]  and then we were able to post up a high-run version
[02:49:47.480 --> 02:49:49.480]  of all the incidents on our YouTube channel
[02:49:49.480 --> 02:49:53.480]  on YouTube.com forward slash VRC.
[02:49:53.480 --> 02:49:56.480]  Now, so let me get this straight.
[02:49:56.480 --> 02:50:00.480]  It was your idea to try to get the general big main march
[02:50:00.480 --> 02:50:04.480]  that Soros was trying to co-opt with the unions and people
[02:50:04.480 --> 02:50:07.480]  to direct that down towards the actual enemy,
[02:50:07.480 --> 02:50:08.480]  the private Federal Reserve.
[02:50:08.480 --> 02:50:10.480]  That's what I basically got from Jacobson.
[02:50:10.480 --> 02:50:11.480]  Is that what happened?
[02:50:11.480 --> 02:50:16.480]  I mean, I came there mostly to document the proceedings.
[02:50:16.480 --> 02:50:20.480]  I know a lot of people there were demanding to go to the Fed.
[02:50:20.480 --> 02:50:24.480]  The only problem is some protesters got permits,
[02:50:24.480 --> 02:50:29.480]  and in order to not create any hazardous situations,
[02:50:29.480 --> 02:50:32.480]  those plans were avoided, but there were many protesters
[02:50:32.480 --> 02:50:34.480]  the day before at the General Assembly calling to
[02:50:34.480 --> 02:50:36.480]  end the private Federal Reserve,
[02:50:36.480 --> 02:50:40.480]  and many people were in approval here in New York City.
[02:50:40.480 --> 02:50:43.480]  But with this parade permit and with about,
[02:50:43.480 --> 02:50:46.480]  some people estimate 20,000 people,
[02:50:46.480 --> 02:50:48.480]  you have to keep a strict eye on it,
[02:50:48.480 --> 02:50:50.480]  and it's impossible to reach out for questions.
[02:50:50.480 --> 02:50:51.480]  I understand.
[02:50:51.480 --> 02:50:52.480]  Stay there.
[02:50:52.480 --> 02:50:53.480]  We'll talk to you on the other side.
[02:50:53.480 --> 02:50:54.480]  It's Luke Radowski.
[02:50:54.480 --> 02:50:55.480]  I'm Alex Jones,
[02:50:55.480 --> 02:50:58.480]  PrisonPlanet.TV and FallWars.com.
[02:50:58.480 --> 02:51:00.480]  Stay with us.
[02:51:00.480 --> 02:51:03.480]  With economic and job-based stress,
[02:51:03.480 --> 02:51:05.480]  now the leading cause of illness,
[02:51:05.480 --> 02:51:08.480]  is your body ready for the hard times ahead?
[02:51:12.480 --> 02:51:14.480]  This is Bill Hyde with a special report
[02:51:14.480 --> 02:51:16.480]  on staying healthy in hard times.
[02:51:16.480 --> 02:51:18.480]  According to a new article in the London Telegraph,
[02:51:18.480 --> 02:51:21.480]  job stress associated with the economic downturn
[02:51:21.480 --> 02:51:24.480]  has now replaced cancer, stroke, heart attack,
[02:51:24.480 --> 02:51:27.480]  and back problems as the number one reason people miss work.
[02:51:27.480 --> 02:51:30.480]  In fact, it's now being called the black death of our time.
[02:51:30.480 --> 02:51:32.480]  This means taking care of your body
[02:51:32.480 --> 02:51:35.480]  could be the single most important thing you do,
[02:51:35.480 --> 02:51:37.480]  especially in these hard economic times.
[02:51:37.480 --> 02:51:39.480]  Recently, we've created a video
[02:51:39.480 --> 02:51:41.480]  which you can watch online for free,
[02:51:41.480 --> 02:51:43.480]  detailing how to make sure your body is ready
[02:51:43.480 --> 02:51:45.480]  for the dangerous times we live in.
[02:51:45.480 --> 02:51:48.480]  You can find the video at longtermgreen.com.
[02:51:48.480 --> 02:51:50.480]  That's longtermgreen.com.
[02:51:50.480 --> 02:51:53.480]  Get your body ready for the hard times ahead

[02:51:56.480 --> 02:52:00.480]  The video's available at longtermgreen.com.
[02:52:00.480 --> 02:52:02.480]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:52:02.480 --> 02:52:04.480]  You all know I've worked for years with Steve Shank
[02:52:04.480 --> 02:52:05.480]  in eFood Direct.
[02:52:05.480 --> 02:52:08.480]  I have eFoods for my own emergency food supply.
[02:52:08.480 --> 02:52:11.480]  You know Steve, life is different now for all of us, isn't it?
[02:52:11.480 --> 02:52:12.480]  Very different.
[02:52:12.480 --> 02:52:14.480]  People are using this great food to survive
[02:52:14.480 --> 02:52:16.480]  the present hurricane season,
[02:52:16.480 --> 02:52:19.480]  and we've already had $40 billion worth of damage
[02:52:19.480 --> 02:52:22.480]  from floods, storms, quakes, and droughts.
[02:52:22.480 --> 02:52:24.480]  And that's just the first eight months of this year.
[02:52:24.480 --> 02:52:26.480]  Natural disasters are newsworthy,
[02:52:26.480 --> 02:52:28.480]  but only touch a few of us Americans.
[02:52:28.480 --> 02:52:30.480]  The huge issue of the greatest depression
[02:52:30.480 --> 02:52:32.480]  is on everyone's mind.
[02:52:32.480 --> 02:52:34.480]  The unemployment, the loss of homes,
[02:52:34.480 --> 02:52:36.480]  lost businesses, and skyrocketing food costs
[02:52:36.480 --> 02:52:38.480]  are hitting every American,
[02:52:38.480 --> 02:52:40.480]  so everyone needs food security.
[02:52:40.480 --> 02:52:42.480]  Folks, this month you will get free shipping

[02:54:00.040 --> 02:54:18.360]  Now, we've been airing this all week, it was Luke Radowski that talked to the self-propelled
[02:54:18.360 --> 02:54:23.520]  stomach, Mr. Kami Michael Moore, who says capitalism's the problem, exactly what the
[02:54:23.520 --> 02:54:28.480]  megabanks want is to knock out their competition, and I've told you, ran into Amy Goodman,
[02:54:28.480 --> 02:54:33.520]  the self-propelled stomach, Michael Moore, all of the banker minions out there masquerading
[02:54:33.520 --> 02:54:35.440]  as liberty seekers.
[02:54:35.440 --> 02:54:36.440]  What happened, Luke?
[02:54:36.440 --> 02:54:38.360]  Well, you're going to be able to see all the videos.
[02:54:38.360 --> 02:54:42.640]  I actually went up to Amy Goodman, and I asked her if the money she got from George
[02:54:42.640 --> 02:54:48.520]  Soros has affected her journalism, and she pretty much just ran away, just pretty much
[02:54:48.520 --> 02:54:51.720]  hid behind two people, and said she didn't want to talk to me, and just wanted to be
[02:54:51.720 --> 02:54:54.200]  a protest which shows so much.
[02:54:54.200 --> 02:54:57.760]  I met up with Michael Moore, and actually got a clarification, I was able to have a
[02:54:57.760 --> 02:55:02.640]  pretty long discussion with him about the Federal Reserve, and he seemed up to date
[02:55:02.640 --> 02:55:07.280]  about what's happening, and the major general consensus of that Michael Moore video is that
[02:55:07.280 --> 02:55:10.840]  we could have different opinions, different views, but we could be here in the park when
[02:55:10.840 --> 02:55:14.760]  we could talk to each other civilly, and be able to discuss these ideas.
[02:55:14.760 --> 02:55:20.520]  So, the Michael Moore video is pretty interesting, he did get into the Fed, he said it is just
[02:55:20.520 --> 02:55:24.960]  like a printing press, it shouldn't even be called the Fed, so that was very interesting,
[02:55:24.960 --> 02:55:29.160]  and one thing Michael Moore said when he was speaking to the General Assembly is that he
[02:55:29.160 --> 02:55:33.240]  is not the leader of this organization, he is not the spokesperson, he is here only to
[02:55:33.240 --> 02:55:39.200]  be in support, and he does not want his representation in this, he just wants to be a part of it,
[02:55:39.200 --> 02:55:43.240]  that's what he said, and I mean that's what's great about the Liberty Park, there's so many
[02:55:43.240 --> 02:55:47.280]  people from so many different perspectives who are just fed up coming together and yelling
[02:55:47.280 --> 02:55:50.080]  I'm mad at health, and I'm not going to take it anymore.
[02:55:50.080 --> 02:55:55.000]  Well, Luke, I have called, as you know, since last Sunday for people all over the United
[02:55:55.000 --> 02:56:00.080]  States to occupy fellow reserve locations, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, right into the next
[02:56:00.080 --> 02:56:04.760]  week, we need people to sleep on the street, you name it, and actually occupy the real
[02:56:04.760 --> 02:56:09.920]  enemy to draw media attention and shift this whole Occupy Wall Street thing over to the
[02:56:09.920 --> 02:56:14.360]  Fed, what's your take on that event?
[02:56:14.360 --> 02:56:20.040]  I mean, I think the more demonstrations, the more campouts, the more protests, the better,
[02:56:20.040 --> 02:56:25.040]  but I think altogether there's the mass movement that we have to all bring together and come
[02:56:25.040 --> 02:56:31.280]  to one, a lot of people are fed up, the people at Zucati Park, at Liberty Park, the Occupy
[02:56:31.280 --> 02:56:37.000]  Wall Street kids, this movement has, from my experience, from being there day one has
[02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:42.520]  not been co-opted, it's still grassroots, and yet, yes, I have to say that yes, it could
[02:56:42.520 --> 02:56:46.840]  be very possibly, very easily taken over, but this is all grassroots, everything's done
[02:56:46.840 --> 02:56:51.560]  democratically, I've been working, talking to the committees, talking to so many people,
[02:56:51.560 --> 02:56:56.880]  and the whole movement, it pretty much depends on the people who come there and work and
[02:56:56.880 --> 02:57:01.360]  put in effort to get things accomplished, so if good people show up there and make
[02:57:01.360 --> 02:57:05.800]  sure it's not co-opted, there's a chance that this thing may even go towards ending
[02:57:05.800 --> 02:57:06.800]  the private sector.
[02:57:06.800 --> 02:57:10.160]  Well, that's exactly what our reporters have found, that's what you've reported to us.
[02:57:10.160 --> 02:57:15.480]  The mainstream media is trying to act like, you know, these people want socialism and
[02:57:15.480 --> 02:57:19.040]  the rest of it, but actually, from what I've seen, they're really figuring out what's
[02:57:19.040 --> 02:57:23.000]  happening in the patriots, the end-the-fetters, like you were there educating them.
[02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:25.120]  Are you guys planning to march on the fellow reserve tomorrow?
[02:57:25.120 --> 02:57:29.120]  I'm going to be, I'm going to go down there tomorrow, I'm going to find out exactly what's
[02:57:29.120 --> 02:57:32.600]  happening, everything's still chaotic, but you're definitely right about that last point.
[02:57:32.600 --> 02:57:37.720]  I mean, Ed Schultz was down there last night trying to say that there's Obama supporters
[02:57:37.720 --> 02:57:41.560]  in the net that this was the left-wing tea party and people were behind him shutting
[02:57:41.560 --> 02:57:42.560]  him down.
[02:57:42.560 --> 02:57:47.160]  He was doing a live set right outside Dr. Pite Wall Street and people were just screaming
[02:57:47.160 --> 02:57:51.120]  for him just to go home and not to try to co-opt this movement and that's what the mainstream
[02:57:51.120 --> 02:57:52.120]  media is trying to do.
[02:57:52.120 --> 02:57:57.120]  It's trying to put us in that left-right paradigm, trying to divide and conquer us, but the people
[02:57:57.120 --> 02:57:59.640]  here know what's up and they won't let that happen.
[02:57:59.640 --> 02:58:03.280]  This is not a left and right movement, it's not the movement of the people, of the people
[02:58:03.280 --> 02:58:06.560]  and we're just, we're just mad at each other and we're trying to get something accomplished,
[02:58:06.560 --> 02:58:07.760]  we're trying to get something done.
[02:58:07.760 --> 02:58:12.360]  We got to unite forces, there is a possibility for great, significant change in this country
[02:58:12.360 --> 02:58:15.840]  and it all lies in the hands of people who come out there, who come out to the fed, who
[02:58:15.840 --> 02:58:18.240]  come out to work with us and take care of us.
[02:58:18.240 --> 02:58:22.360]  Look we're out of time here, we'll be back tomorrow 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.
[02:58:22.360 --> 02:58:25.680]  Obviously we want you to give us an update tomorrow.
[02:58:25.680 --> 02:58:31.000]  Tomorrow I'm going to be on the street, tomorrow I'm going to be on the street in Dallas.
[02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:38.480]  I'm going to be on the street in Dallas, join me there, I'll see you back tonight at 7 o'clock.
[02:58:38.480 --> 02:58:42.600]  Luke, stay there, I want to talk to you.
[02:58:42.600 --> 02:59:01.560]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
