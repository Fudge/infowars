[00:00.000 --> 00:19.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Thursday, March 11th, 2021.
[00:19.360 --> 00:26.440]  This is the Alex Jones show on the Infowars Broadcasting Network.
[00:26.440 --> 00:30.800]  Oh, and Troy are here sitting in studio for the Alex Jones show.
[00:30.800 --> 00:33.200]  Alex is going to be joining us momentarily.
[00:33.200 --> 00:36.880]  I want to lay out what we can expect coming up today
[00:36.880 --> 00:39.000]  on the broadcast, what I'll be covering,
[00:39.000 --> 00:44.320]  and of course, Alex as well, coming up in the next segment.
[00:44.320 --> 00:48.160]  It's been an interesting social experiment, if you will,
[00:48.160 --> 00:51.480]  not intentionally, but for my purposes.
[00:51.480 --> 00:56.800]  Watching how Austin, Texas is responding to the MASC mandate
[00:56.800 --> 01:01.760]  recall or removal, which was illegal to begin with,
[01:01.760 --> 01:05.200]  and then the Democrat scumbag mayor, Steve Adler,
[01:05.200 --> 01:10.360]  a true scumbag, a true lowlife, one of the worst mayors
[01:10.360 --> 01:13.280]  you could ever imagine, saying, no, we're not
[01:13.280 --> 01:14.200]  ending the MASC mandate.
[01:14.200 --> 01:17.400]  We're forcing businesses to MASC, in fact, in Austin.
[01:17.400 --> 01:18.960]  We're forcing citizens to MASC, and then
[01:18.960 --> 01:22.720]  seeing the response to that in the last 24 hours has been
[01:22.720 --> 01:25.000]  telling.
[01:25.000 --> 01:30.160]  And it makes me wonder, maybe I am the oddball.
[01:30.160 --> 01:34.320]  Maybe wanting to be free is not a good thing.
[01:34.320 --> 01:37.600]  Maybe I'm the problem, and all the liberals here in Austin
[01:37.600 --> 01:39.520]  that want to wear the MASC and want to take the vaccine
[01:39.520 --> 01:41.120]  and want to be slaves to the New World Order,
[01:41.120 --> 01:42.440]  maybe they got it right.
[01:42.440 --> 01:44.560]  Maybe I should be one of them.
[01:44.560 --> 01:46.160]  Maybe I should be a good little slave
[01:46.160 --> 01:47.600]  like the rest of the Austinites wearing
[01:47.600 --> 01:49.280]  their masks around town.
[01:49.280 --> 01:51.800]  By the way, I noticed that the MASC wearing was actually
[01:51.800 --> 01:53.560]  at an uptick.
[01:53.560 --> 01:56.800]  So it's 100% a political statement now,
[01:56.800 --> 01:59.000]  and the Attorney General Ken Paxson
[01:59.000 --> 02:05.040]  is threatening to sue Steve Adler for forcing
[02:05.040 --> 02:08.600]  Texans here in Austin to wear a mask.
[02:08.600 --> 02:11.480]  Oh, and they still can't reopen their business fully either.
[02:11.480 --> 02:13.080]  So you got that.
[02:13.080 --> 02:19.280]  So a true dirt bag, Steve Adler, a true low life,
[02:19.280 --> 02:21.000]  a cockroach of a human being.
[02:21.000 --> 02:23.640]  I shouldn't even say that a cockroach has more standing
[02:23.640 --> 02:25.880]  and integrity than Steve Adler.
[02:25.880 --> 02:31.560]  A cockroach turd has more dignity, more honesty,
[02:31.560 --> 02:34.960]  more trustworthiness than Steve Adler.
[02:34.960 --> 02:38.200]  So we're going to be talking about that.
[02:38.200 --> 02:40.600]  The Biden presidency, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:40.600 --> 02:44.080]  would you believe me if I told you that there are stories
[02:44.080 --> 02:46.080]  floating around talking about Biden
[02:46.080 --> 02:49.360]  holograms replacing him for public speeches?
[02:49.360 --> 02:50.120]  Would you believe me?
[02:50.120 --> 02:52.680]  Because now that's in the headlines.
[02:52.680 --> 02:54.520]  So are they going to soft-roll this out
[02:54.520 --> 02:56.120]  instead of kind of like surprising us
[02:56.120 --> 02:58.600]  with the holograms and stuff, catching us off guard?
[02:58.600 --> 03:00.360]  Maybe they just bring it in and implement it
[03:00.360 --> 03:02.120]  like, no, this is normal.
[03:02.120 --> 03:05.320]  It's normal for a Biden hologram to do a State of the Union.
[03:05.320 --> 03:07.760]  It's normal for the Biden hologram to take questions
[03:07.760 --> 03:09.840]  because Biden can't do it.
[03:09.840 --> 03:12.480]  He's almost dead.
[03:12.480 --> 03:14.520]  And for all intents and purposes, as a president,
[03:14.520 --> 03:16.800]  he might as well be.
[03:16.800 --> 03:19.800]  But he is going to sign the $2 trillion stimulus
[03:19.800 --> 03:23.240]  bill tomorrow, which is the biggest pork
[03:23.240 --> 03:26.960]  spending in United States history,
[03:26.960 --> 03:30.560]  bailing out Democrat states that have been running
[03:30.560 --> 03:36.440]  at crippling deficits, bailing out Democrat-run schools,
[03:36.440 --> 03:41.040]  funding all kinds of Democrat policy, less than 10%
[03:41.040 --> 03:46.160]  of this $2 trillion is actually going towards stimulus relief.
[03:46.160 --> 03:48.760]  And of course, they say, you may or may not
[03:48.760 --> 03:51.440]  get a $1,400 check, which of course is ironic.
[03:51.440 --> 03:57.760]  How can they know the number of monies
[03:57.760 --> 04:00.360]  if they don't even know who's getting the check for $1,400
[04:00.360 --> 04:01.440]  or who's not?
[04:01.440 --> 04:03.040]  They don't know.
[04:03.040 --> 04:04.280]  How can you do that math?
[04:04.280 --> 04:05.600]  How can you sign that bill?
[04:05.600 --> 04:07.040]  It's all a joke.
[04:07.040 --> 04:10.800]  You probably will never get that money.
[04:10.800 --> 04:12.160]  So that's coming up.
[04:12.160 --> 04:17.200]  Some news coming out of China as well that is eyebrow raising.
[04:17.200 --> 04:19.720]  The Democrats and the Republicans
[04:19.720 --> 04:20.840]  are fighting about abortion.
[04:20.840 --> 04:22.800]  A couple of states are banning abortion.
[04:22.800 --> 04:25.600]  And now New York is saying, you can't even protest abortion.
[04:25.600 --> 04:27.040]  I'm not even kidding you.
[04:27.040 --> 04:27.840]  I've warned you.
[04:27.840 --> 04:29.840]  We've told you about the New York Attorney General,
[04:29.840 --> 04:30.560]  Leticia James.
[04:30.560 --> 04:33.880]  Now she's saying, you cannot protest abortion in New York.
[04:33.880 --> 04:34.880]  I'm not kidding you.
[04:34.880 --> 04:38.160]  But look at this picture from a year ago, if you would with me.
[04:38.160 --> 04:39.720]  Put this on screen, guys.
[04:39.720 --> 04:42.520]  This is Donald Trump a year ago today.
[04:42.520 --> 04:45.920]  This is what America is supposed to look like.
[04:45.920 --> 04:48.480]  No masks, a president addressing the media.
[04:48.480 --> 04:50.120]  Everyone's attention on him.
[04:50.120 --> 04:51.160]  But what's happening now?
[04:51.160 --> 04:52.120]  Everyone wearing a mask.
[04:52.120 --> 04:52.840]  Everyone's a slave.
[04:52.840 --> 04:55.200]  Nobody pays attention because the president is fake
[04:55.200 --> 04:56.360]  and can't even think or talk.
[04:56.360 --> 04:58.800]  Alex Jones coming up.
[04:58.800 --> 05:02.840]  The general public has finally figured out why I'm upset.
[05:02.840 --> 05:05.000]  They figured out that the globalists are literally
[05:05.000 --> 05:05.880]  trying to kill us.
[05:05.880 --> 05:08.400]  They're trying to take over civilization and society.
[05:08.400 --> 05:11.480]  And they depend on the public being ignorant.
[05:11.480 --> 05:12.320]  That's what Jesus said.
[05:12.320 --> 05:15.000]  My people perish for lack of knowledge.
[05:15.000 --> 05:16.640]  Knowledge is power.
[05:16.640 --> 05:19.360]  Like our bodies are made up of all these tissues
[05:19.360 --> 05:23.320]  and all these systems that die without essential vitamins
[05:23.320 --> 05:24.080]  and minerals.
[05:24.080 --> 05:25.040]  And that's why they don't want you
[05:25.040 --> 05:27.400]  to know about essential vitamins and minerals.
[05:27.400 --> 05:28.520]  Because it's so simple.
[05:28.520 --> 05:30.480]  Because you won't be under their control anymore.
[05:30.480 --> 05:33.080]  Well, the vitamin mineral fusion, the highest quality
[05:33.080 --> 05:35.360]  vitamin mineral fusion system out there
[05:35.360 --> 05:38.040]  in a liquid vitamin form is now back in stock
[05:38.040 --> 05:39.360]  at infoworkstore.com.
[05:39.360 --> 05:41.640]  And it's not just an incredible formula at a great price.
[05:41.640 --> 05:44.680]  It funds the info war at the same time.
[05:44.680 --> 05:47.120]  No other product you can buy does that.
[05:47.120 --> 05:50.160]  So again, infoworkstore.com, it's back in stock,
[05:50.160 --> 05:52.200]  50% off, vitamin mineral fusion.
[05:52.200 --> 05:54.560]  I'm going to keep it at that until it sells out.
[05:54.560 --> 05:56.960]  So take action today and give it to your first family
[05:56.960 --> 06:01.440]  as a gift.
[06:01.440 --> 06:05.680]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[06:05.680 --> 06:07.920]  and the heart of the resistance.
[06:07.920 --> 06:34.760]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[06:34.760 --> 06:41.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Thursday, March 11, 2021.
[06:41.280 --> 06:43.480]  This is the Alex Jones Show, sitting in for Alex Jones
[06:43.480 --> 06:44.600]  in studio.
[06:44.600 --> 06:45.600]  I'm Owen Troyer.
[06:45.600 --> 06:49.520]  We're going to be hearing from Alex coming up momentarily.
[06:49.520 --> 06:53.000]  It is a loaded news day today.
[06:53.000 --> 06:54.880]  Absolutely loaded.
[06:54.880 --> 06:57.200]  I haven't even been able to get through all the news that's
[06:57.200 --> 07:00.520]  on my desk here to get it properly sorted out.
[07:00.520 --> 07:05.480]  But believe me, for the next four hours on the Alex Jones
[07:05.480 --> 07:06.800]  Show, there's going to be a lot of news.
[07:06.800 --> 07:08.600]  And then I'll be back hosting the war room.
[07:08.600 --> 07:09.720]  And there'll be even more news.
[07:09.720 --> 07:12.160]  I will need seven hours of live broadcasting today
[07:12.160 --> 07:13.080]  to cover all this news.
[07:15.960 --> 07:20.800]  Where to begin, though, the failing Biden administration
[07:20.800 --> 07:25.280]  that is now so inept and so out of control
[07:25.280 --> 07:28.680]  that there are headlines saying we need a Biden hologram
[07:28.680 --> 07:31.160]  to handle his public speeches because he can't do it.
[07:31.160 --> 07:34.000]  I'm not even kidding you.
[07:34.000 --> 07:37.800]  All of Biden's appointees to his administration
[07:37.800 --> 07:47.000]  are either corrupt, admitted racists, or even criminals.
[07:47.000 --> 07:51.720]  And this was all well known before they even got appointed.
[07:51.720 --> 07:53.880]  So you've got the Attorney General, Merrick Garland, who
[07:53.880 --> 07:56.240]  can't answer basic questions like,
[07:56.240 --> 07:57.720]  is it illegal to cross the border?
[07:57.720 --> 08:00.400]  He can't answer that question from Josh Halley.
[08:00.400 --> 08:03.640]  You've got the Secretary of Health, Rachel Levine,
[08:03.640 --> 08:07.400]  or whatever, the guy in drag, who
[08:07.400 --> 08:09.880]  wants to castrate your children, who
[08:09.880 --> 08:14.720]  wants to castrate, chop your boys' genitals off.
[08:14.720 --> 08:17.080]  And when Rand Paul asked that during the confirmation
[08:17.080 --> 08:21.320]  hearings, the Health Secretary doesn't deny it.
[08:21.320 --> 08:23.000]  He says, well, yeah, this is very nuanced.
[08:23.000 --> 08:25.720]  So yeah, we want to chop your boys' genitals off.
[08:25.720 --> 08:29.440]  And yeah, that's good.
[08:29.440 --> 08:34.240]  The border is out of control, ladies and gentlemen.
[08:34.240 --> 08:37.040]  And of course, you're not allowed to have an event
[08:37.040 --> 08:38.080]  according to the Democrats.
[08:38.080 --> 08:39.160]  You can't go to a bar.
[08:39.160 --> 08:40.120]  You can't have a party.
[08:40.120 --> 08:41.000]  You can't go to school.
[08:41.000 --> 08:41.840]  You can't go to church.
[08:41.840 --> 08:46.160]  But they are now overflow capacity
[08:46.160 --> 08:48.080]  in what they're now calling the reception centers.
[08:48.080 --> 08:49.720]  They were cages when Trump was in office,
[08:49.720 --> 08:50.920]  but their reception centers now.
[08:50.920 --> 08:52.920]  Either way, they're overflowing.
[08:52.920 --> 08:54.440]  Talk about a super spreader event.
[08:54.440 --> 08:58.000]  By the way, a lot of these illegal immigrants
[08:58.000 --> 09:01.480]  are testing positive for COVID and then being
[09:01.480 --> 09:02.920]  released into the community.
[09:02.920 --> 09:06.880]  So so much for that fear.
[09:06.880 --> 09:10.800]  So much for that fear mongering.
[09:10.800 --> 09:14.440]  And now you have Democrats not just out
[09:14.440 --> 09:17.960]  for your First Amendment on the internet.
[09:17.960 --> 09:22.840]  Now they are banning you from protesting abortion in New York.
[09:22.840 --> 09:24.880]  I am not kidding you.
[09:28.720 --> 09:30.720]  So all of that and more is coming up.
[09:30.720 --> 09:34.960]  Democrats are now raising their kids to be gay,
[09:34.960 --> 09:36.480]  celebrating it, proud of it.
[09:40.040 --> 09:42.440]  So it's really just incredible to witness all this.
[09:42.440 --> 09:44.560]  But I want to go back and I want to start it with this.
[09:44.560 --> 09:47.600]  Guys, put the picture that I have up there from Trump
[09:47.600 --> 09:49.680]  last year inside the White House,
[09:49.680 --> 09:54.480]  taking questions from the media.
[09:54.480 --> 09:55.880]  Notice what you have here.
[09:55.880 --> 09:57.240]  Now this is a year ago.
[09:57.240 --> 09:59.600]  So technically, this is when the pandemic was actually
[09:59.600 --> 10:01.040]  at its peak.
[10:01.040 --> 10:02.280]  This is when it was peaking.
[10:02.280 --> 10:03.480]  This is when it was the worst ever.
[10:03.480 --> 10:06.760]  This is when they were telling us 3 million were going to die.
[10:06.760 --> 10:09.280]  Trump's not wearing a mask.
[10:09.280 --> 10:11.560]  His officials up there with him are not wearing masks.
[10:11.560 --> 10:13.160]  Security's not wearing a mask.
[10:13.160 --> 10:14.880]  None of the media is wearing a mask.
[10:14.880 --> 10:16.440]  And they're all piled into this room.
[10:16.440 --> 10:20.360]  Guess what? It wasn't a super spreader event.
[10:20.360 --> 10:22.320]  Everybody was just fine.
[10:22.320 --> 10:24.160]  How is that possible a year ago today
[10:24.160 --> 10:26.880]  at the peak of the virus when 3 million of us
[10:26.880 --> 10:27.920]  were going to die?
[10:27.920 --> 10:30.960]  Said Fauci.
[10:30.960 --> 10:32.160]  So that's the one takeaway.
[10:32.160 --> 10:33.240]  This is just a year ago.
[10:33.240 --> 10:34.200]  This is just one year ago.
[10:34.200 --> 10:35.840]  My how things have changed.
[10:35.840 --> 10:36.640]  That's one takeaway.
[10:36.640 --> 10:37.880]  Here's the other takeaway.
[10:37.880 --> 10:39.400]  Notice what else you're seeing here.
[10:41.960 --> 10:43.640]  You're saying, well, what do you mean?
[10:43.640 --> 10:45.080]  Well, it's pretty obvious, isn't it?
[10:45.080 --> 10:46.720]  You have a president of the United States
[10:46.720 --> 10:49.880]  that can actually stand up on his own two feet
[10:49.880 --> 10:53.000]  and walk and talk to the media.
[10:53.000 --> 10:56.840]  We don't have that anymore.
[10:56.840 --> 11:01.880]  We have a dementia-ridden, maybe even Alzheimer's-ridden,
[11:01.880 --> 11:06.160]  failing Biden, who was never even elected,
[11:06.160 --> 11:07.520]  who can't hold a press conference,
[11:07.520 --> 11:09.560]  can't hold a state of the union address,
[11:09.560 --> 11:12.840]  can't do really any speech more than 10 minutes these days.
[11:12.840 --> 11:14.400]  Everything he does is digital.
[11:14.400 --> 11:17.680]  He has to ask Nancy Pelosi for permission
[11:17.680 --> 11:19.840]  to either end a press conference or take questions,
[11:19.840 --> 11:21.920]  and then they just cut the feet anyway.
[11:21.920 --> 11:23.440]  When it finishes, it's always awkward
[11:23.440 --> 11:25.120]  because he doesn't know where to walk, what he's doing,
[11:25.120 --> 11:27.760]  who he is.
[11:27.760 --> 11:28.880]  And this was just a year ago.
[11:28.880 --> 11:32.120]  But notice in that picture, all the attention is on Trump.
[11:32.120 --> 11:33.640]  All the focus is on Trump.
[11:33.640 --> 11:35.840]  Trump is in control of the room.
[11:35.840 --> 11:37.560]  He's in control of the situation.
[11:37.560 --> 11:39.160]  He's the president of the United States.
[11:39.160 --> 11:42.000]  He's the leader of the free world.
[11:42.000 --> 11:45.760]  You don't get that anymore under Biden.
[11:45.760 --> 11:46.960]  And you may never.
[11:46.960 --> 11:48.760]  That's what you get right there under Biden,
[11:48.760 --> 11:52.840]  a confused old codger who doesn't know where he is
[11:52.840 --> 11:57.960]  or what he's doing or what he's supposed to be doing.
[11:57.960 --> 12:02.120]  My, what a difference a year makes.
[12:02.120 --> 12:03.400]  What a difference a year makes indeed.
[12:03.400 --> 12:06.440]  Now, I have to say this, before we're
[12:06.440 --> 12:08.920]  going to be joined by Alex Jones coming up
[12:08.920 --> 12:16.920]  in the next segment, I have been extremely disappointed.
[12:16.920 --> 12:20.160]  And I'm not really sure if there's individuals to blame
[12:20.160 --> 12:21.400]  or if it's Adler or what.
[12:21.400 --> 12:24.680]  But I have to say, I am extremely disheartened
[12:24.680 --> 12:27.800]  and disappointed at the response here in Austin, Texas.
[12:27.800 --> 12:30.200]  This city is pathetic, man.
[12:30.200 --> 12:32.560]  And I feel bad because there's a lot of great people here.
[12:32.560 --> 12:33.880]  And it really is a beautiful city.
[12:33.880 --> 12:34.880]  It's a great city.
[12:34.880 --> 12:38.960]  Boy, oh boy, is it under the liberal mind control.
[12:38.960 --> 12:40.680]  I mean, wow.
[12:40.680 --> 12:44.000]  The mask mandate was lifted yesterday.
[12:44.000 --> 12:47.080]  More people are wearing masks in Austin today
[12:47.080 --> 12:49.320]  than they were before the mandate was lifted.
[12:49.320 --> 12:50.720]  I'm not kidding you.
[12:50.720 --> 12:52.960]  Now, granted, the people that aren't wearing the mask
[12:52.960 --> 12:54.960]  are now just not wearing the masks at all.
[12:54.960 --> 12:57.120]  So you do have that aspect of it.
[12:57.120 --> 13:00.040]  But it's few and far between.
[13:00.040 --> 13:04.400]  And now I'm seeing more people wearing masks in their car.
[13:04.400 --> 13:07.280]  Yeah, look at this communist on our city council.
[13:07.280 --> 13:09.560]  The city of Austin is still legally requiring masks.
[13:09.560 --> 13:11.640]  No, that's not legal at all.
[13:11.640 --> 13:14.040]  You cannot make me breathe.
[13:14.040 --> 13:16.560]  I'm telling you, man, I'm so sick of these liberals.
[13:19.240 --> 13:20.280]  I'm trying not to get mad here.
[13:20.280 --> 13:22.640]  It's before even 20 minutes into the broadcast.
[13:22.640 --> 13:26.600]  But man, these people are just sick.
[13:26.600 --> 13:28.400]  But I'm wondering, I mean, maybe I'm the sick one.
[13:28.400 --> 13:30.360]  Maybe me wanting to be free.
[13:30.360 --> 13:32.520]  Maybe me wanting to be in control of my body.
[13:32.520 --> 13:34.360]  Maybe me wanting to breathe air.
[13:34.360 --> 13:37.120]  Maybe me not wanting to take a trial vaccine that's deadly.
[13:37.120 --> 13:38.600]  Maybe I'm the crazy one.
[13:38.600 --> 13:39.920]  Maybe I'm the problem.
[13:39.920 --> 13:41.320]  You know, maybe that's me.
[13:41.320 --> 13:44.000]  Maybe humans wanting to be free is the problem.
[13:44.000 --> 13:47.360]  Well, yeah, if you ask Greg Cesar, a communist,
[13:47.360 --> 13:49.660]  on our city council, yeah, humans should not be free.
[13:49.660 --> 13:51.480]  If you ask Steve Adler, a Democrat,
[13:51.480 --> 13:54.800]  scumbag lowlife of a mayor, yeah, you know what?
[13:54.800 --> 13:55.680]  You shouldn't be free.
[13:55.680 --> 13:57.240]  You should be a slave.
[13:57.240 --> 13:59.160]  And so they say, they're celebrating it.
[13:59.160 --> 14:01.600]  We are still legally making you wear a mask.
[14:01.600 --> 14:03.400]  We are still in charge of you.
[14:03.400 --> 14:05.120]  We run your body.
[14:05.120 --> 14:08.000]  We are in control of your air intake.
[14:08.000 --> 14:09.400]  Fuck you, man.
[14:10.440 --> 14:12.600]  Seriously, I'm sick of this crap.
[14:14.080 --> 14:16.680]  And I'm sitting at the barber shop today.
[14:16.680 --> 14:18.800]  I'm so sick of you commie slave drivers.
[14:18.800 --> 14:20.400]  Wear a mask, wear a mask.
[14:20.400 --> 14:21.400]  Trust the science.
[14:21.400 --> 14:23.360]  There is no science behind your damn mask,
[14:23.360 --> 14:25.640]  except it spreads disease.
[14:25.640 --> 14:30.640]  You pigs, you animals, you demons, we're still legally
[14:33.080 --> 14:34.160]  making you wear a mask.
[14:34.160 --> 14:37.080]  So I'm going around, people wearing masks in their cars.
[14:37.080 --> 14:38.360]  It's all a political statement.
[14:38.360 --> 14:39.720]  I'm sitting at the barber shop today.
[14:39.720 --> 14:42.120]  My barber and I, only one's in there not wearing a mask.
[14:42.120 --> 14:43.320]  It's like six other people in there.
[14:43.320 --> 14:45.200]  They're all wearing masks.
[14:45.200 --> 14:47.280]  And we're having our normal conversation,
[14:47.280 --> 14:48.520]  making fun of the mask.
[14:48.520 --> 14:50.120]  And I'm talking about how the COVID vaccine
[14:50.120 --> 14:52.080]  is killing people and we're talking about,
[14:52.080 --> 14:53.440]  and everyone's kind of listening
[14:53.440 --> 14:58.440]  and their eyes are just like, oh, if 10% is true,
[14:59.360 --> 15:02.080]  if 10% of what that guy's saying is true, whoa.
[15:02.080 --> 15:04.320]  Like, oh my God, that's crazy.
[15:04.320 --> 15:07.040]  Yeah, 100% of what I was saying was true, Jack.
[15:07.040 --> 15:10.120]  The mask spreads disease because it's easy stuff.
[15:10.120 --> 15:10.960]  It's just common sense.
[15:10.960 --> 15:12.400]  Like, yeah, like we're joking.
[15:13.760 --> 15:15.840]  It's like, yeah, liberals say that carbon dioxide
[15:15.840 --> 15:17.680]  is killing the planet.
[15:17.680 --> 15:19.040]  And then it's like, yeah, that's right.
[15:19.040 --> 15:20.760]  Carbon dioxide is killing the planet.
[15:20.760 --> 15:22.840]  So it's funny how liberals want you to wear a mask
[15:22.840 --> 15:24.720]  and breathe in your own carbon dioxide.
[15:24.720 --> 15:27.160]  It's like, whoa, wait, what?
[15:27.160 --> 15:28.760]  Oh, that's true.
[15:28.760 --> 15:31.200]  How is that even, I don't know, should I wear the mask?
[15:31.200 --> 15:33.120]  I mean, the Democrats tell me to wear a mask,
[15:33.120 --> 15:35.120]  my slave masters, but they also tell me
[15:35.120 --> 15:36.760]  that carbon dioxide is killing me.
[15:36.760 --> 15:38.120]  So wait, what do I do?
[15:38.120 --> 15:39.640]  Is carbon dioxide killing us?
[15:39.640 --> 15:40.480]  Is it deadly?
[15:40.480 --> 15:42.240]  Or should I wear the mask and breathe it in all day?
[15:42.240 --> 15:44.800]  Or maybe this is just a suicidal death cult that I'm in
[15:44.800 --> 15:46.000]  and I don't even know it yet.
[15:46.000 --> 15:47.800]  And the mask is just a symbol of it.
[15:49.240 --> 15:52.360]  You Democrat communists are pathetic.
[15:52.360 --> 15:53.600]  Humans will be free.
[15:53.600 --> 15:55.160]  We will be free again.
[15:55.160 --> 15:56.680]  The people are awakening.
[15:56.680 --> 15:59.320]  They're taking control of their own environment.
[15:59.320 --> 16:01.440]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[16:01.440 --> 16:03.800]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[16:03.800 --> 16:06.320]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers,
[16:06.320 --> 16:07.920]  governments, foreign governments,
[16:07.920 --> 16:12.040]  the CHIComs especially, are using this to steal your data,
[16:12.040 --> 16:15.080]  to share your data, to be able to rig markets
[16:15.080 --> 16:17.600]  when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data
[16:17.600 --> 16:19.800]  that can actually predict on record
[16:19.800 --> 16:22.000]  what's gonna happen in mass movements.
[16:22.000 --> 16:25.400]  Cutting them out of that data stream
[16:25.400 --> 16:28.680]  absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[16:28.680 --> 16:30.080]  In their own words, they admit it.
[16:30.080 --> 16:32.360]  So I've been selling privacy pouches
[16:32.360 --> 16:33.800]  and blocket pockets and things like that
[16:33.800 --> 16:35.000]  for more than a decade.
[16:35.000 --> 16:37.000]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[16:37.000 --> 16:38.080]  They're Faraday cages.
[16:38.080 --> 16:39.800]  They just look like a cloth envelope.
[16:39.800 --> 16:41.760]  They work absolutely great.
[16:41.760 --> 16:43.320]  And it just gives you that security
[16:43.320 --> 16:45.160]  to have power over your data
[16:45.160 --> 16:48.160]  and power over your identity when you are traveling
[16:48.160 --> 16:49.880]  and don't want big brother to know what you're up to
[16:49.880 --> 16:50.880]  because it's not their business.
[16:50.880 --> 16:53.600]  Get yours at infostore.com today.
[16:54.560 --> 16:55.960]  Listers ask me all the time,
[16:55.960 --> 16:58.520]  why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[16:58.520 --> 17:01.120]  Why do you have multiple high quality iodine?
[17:01.120 --> 17:01.960]  Why do you do that?
[17:01.960 --> 17:04.800]  Because different strokes for different folks.
[17:04.800 --> 17:06.320]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists
[17:06.320 --> 17:08.640]  and they say, hey, a lot of people love
[17:08.640 --> 17:10.440]  deep earth pure crystal iodine,
[17:10.440 --> 17:12.760]  but you should put one out with deeper crystal iodine
[17:12.760 --> 17:13.640]  and the two other types
[17:13.640 --> 17:16.440]  because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[17:16.440 --> 17:17.280]  Boom, we did it.
[17:17.280 --> 17:18.320]  It's popular. It's X3.
[17:18.320 --> 17:19.560]  Is it better than X2?
[17:19.560 --> 17:21.720]  You decide it's different strokes for different folks.
[17:21.720 --> 17:24.000]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out
[17:24.000 --> 17:27.480]  our very popular powdered pill sleeping.
[17:27.480 --> 17:28.880]  And that is down and out.
[17:28.880 --> 17:32.080]  It's super strong, way stronger than knock out,
[17:32.080 --> 17:33.600]  but they don't compete with each other.
[17:33.600 --> 17:36.280]  Different strokes for different folks, different formulas.
[17:36.280 --> 17:38.720]  And it's 40% off out of the gates

[17:46.720 --> 17:49.720]  At infostore.com or 40% off and free shipping.
[17:57.880 --> 18:00.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:00.960 --> 18:20.960]  You know, it's really hard to come on here and concentrate
[18:20.960 --> 18:24.560]  and not get so upset because here's the problem.
[18:24.560 --> 18:27.120]  There's a common theme. There's a common thread.
[18:27.120 --> 18:29.600]  And this is actually very low level.
[18:29.600 --> 18:34.600]  But we can't even beat this level of intellectual reasoning.
[18:34.760 --> 18:35.720]  So it's very frustrating.
[18:35.720 --> 18:38.000]  It's like if you're playing a video game
[18:38.000 --> 18:40.280]  or you're playing like Mario, the old Mario video game
[18:40.280 --> 18:41.840]  and you can't beat the first level
[18:41.840 --> 18:44.080]  and you're just stuck on the first level.
[18:44.080 --> 18:45.840]  Like, yeah, I can be talking about all these other levels
[18:45.840 --> 18:47.680]  here, like dealing with the globalist,
[18:47.680 --> 18:49.600]  dealing with the new world order,
[18:49.600 --> 18:53.080]  dealing with the vaccine worldwide and all this stuff.
[18:53.080 --> 18:55.440]  We can't even get past level one.
[18:55.440 --> 18:56.800]  That's how pathetic we are.
[18:57.800 --> 18:59.520]  But what is level one?
[18:59.520 --> 19:04.520]  Level one is the base launch pad for any debate moving forward.
[19:07.000 --> 19:09.280]  Are you pro-government or pro-freedom?
[19:09.280 --> 19:11.680]  Are you pro-government or are you pro-freedom?
[19:12.720 --> 19:17.720]  Everything that is Democrat party policy is pro-government,
[19:17.720 --> 19:21.680]  more government, not pro-freedom, removing your freedoms.
[19:22.920 --> 19:25.480]  We can't even get past that basic understanding
[19:25.480 --> 19:28.880]  or appreciation of freedom versus tyranny.
[19:28.880 --> 19:30.320]  So of course the Democrats are coming
[19:30.320 --> 19:31.920]  to put two masks on your face.
[19:31.920 --> 19:34.320]  Of course they're gonna come with an anal swab.
[19:36.160 --> 19:37.640]  Of course they're shutting down your schools,
[19:37.640 --> 19:39.840]  your churches, your businesses.
[19:39.840 --> 19:41.040]  That's who these people are.
[19:41.040 --> 19:42.920]  That's their modus operandi.
[19:42.920 --> 19:43.760]  That's what they want.
[19:43.760 --> 19:46.520]  They wanna run your life.
[19:48.160 --> 19:50.760]  But that's just level one we can barely even deal with.
[19:54.480 --> 19:57.920]  And then when you realize that a Democrat
[19:57.920 --> 20:00.680]  who are liberal on television or in government
[20:00.680 --> 20:04.280]  is a 100% bold-faced liar,
[20:04.280 --> 20:05.800]  except for maybe Tulsi Gabbard.
[20:05.800 --> 20:06.640]  I don't know how she's still
[20:06.640 --> 20:08.920]  in the Democrat party quite frankly.
[20:08.920 --> 20:12.000]  She did a great interview with Trey Gowdy last night
[20:12.000 --> 20:14.480]  attacking the censorship of big tech
[20:14.480 --> 20:16.000]  and cancel culture of the left.
[20:17.640 --> 20:19.200]  But a Democrat in Congress,
[20:19.200 --> 20:20.760]  a liberal progressive Democrat on TV
[20:20.760 --> 20:23.640]  is 110% lying to you about everything they say.
[20:23.640 --> 20:25.960]  This is base level stuff.
[20:25.960 --> 20:28.240]  We should be able to beat that level
[20:28.240 --> 20:30.880]  and be done with it overnight.
[20:30.880 --> 20:32.840]  It should be done.
[20:32.840 --> 20:34.120]  We can't even do it.
[20:35.680 --> 20:37.000]  We can't even do it.
[20:41.680 --> 20:44.120]  Now is that because people wanna be slaves?
[20:44.120 --> 20:45.320]  I think there is an aspect of that.
[20:45.320 --> 20:47.440]  I do think people want to be slaves.
[20:47.440 --> 20:49.800]  I don't know why, it's totally foreign to me.
[20:49.800 --> 20:54.000]  I have not a centilla of desire to be a slave in my body,
[20:54.000 --> 20:55.360]  in my consciousness, in my being.
[20:55.360 --> 20:58.040]  But hey, the average liberal in Texas loves it.
[20:58.040 --> 20:59.520]  They wear two masks.
[20:59.520 --> 21:02.400]  They get mad at you for breathing clean air.
[21:02.400 --> 21:03.800]  They have pro-mask rallies.
[21:03.800 --> 21:06.480]  They say we have to vaccinate 70% of the state
[21:06.480 --> 21:07.960]  before it can open back up.
[21:07.960 --> 21:10.120]  Well, what if 50% of the state doesn't wanna get a vaccine?
[21:10.120 --> 21:11.080]  What are you gonna do then?
[21:11.080 --> 21:12.400]  Doesn't matter, these are tyrants.
[21:12.400 --> 21:14.400]  They will force you to take that vaccine.
[21:18.680 --> 21:21.880]  But again, I'm sitting here stuck on level one
[21:21.880 --> 21:24.160]  saying a man is a man and a woman is a woman.
[21:24.160 --> 21:25.320]  Not anymore.
[21:27.000 --> 21:29.840]  Nope, not to a Democrat, not to a Lib.
[21:30.880 --> 21:34.320]  Not in their backwards twisted ideology
[21:34.320 --> 21:39.120]  in their death cult that they want to suck you into.
[21:39.120 --> 21:40.960]  Yeah, I didn't see the mask episode.
[21:40.960 --> 21:43.760]  Apparently South Park did a mask special last night.
[21:44.920 --> 21:46.560]  So I can't really comment on that.
[21:51.160 --> 21:53.120]  Look at what the Dems are up to here.
[21:53.120 --> 21:56.160]  Michigan bill to require trans student athletes
[21:56.160 --> 21:59.160]  to compete under gender identified at birth
[21:59.160 --> 22:00.960]  as 20 states, most similar laws.
[22:00.960 --> 22:03.480]  So you now have to write laws
[22:03.480 --> 22:08.480]  because of the Democrat Party and liberal agenda.
[22:08.640 --> 22:10.800]  You now have to write laws that say men
[22:10.800 --> 22:12.920]  cannot compete in women's sports.
[22:12.920 --> 22:17.920]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[22:18.560 --> 22:19.480]  Woo!
[22:20.640 --> 22:22.440]  Hey, I've got an idea.
[22:22.440 --> 22:24.560]  Men shouldn't compete with women.
[22:24.560 --> 22:26.720]  Hmm, we'll have to think about that.
[22:28.120 --> 22:29.280]  We'll have to think about that one.
[22:29.280 --> 22:30.920]  But Democrats say that's bigoted.
[22:32.000 --> 22:36.720]  Even though a poll that Breitbart published shows
[22:36.720 --> 22:39.760]  broad support for banning transgender athletes, men,
[22:39.760 --> 22:42.400]  from women's sports, even amongst the Democrat Party.
[22:44.920 --> 22:47.840]  There should be such a mass exodus of the Democrat Party.
[22:47.840 --> 22:48.920]  And there already is.
[22:48.920 --> 22:51.440]  It's not being reflected because they cheat the system.
[22:51.440 --> 22:54.480]  They cheat by censoring all the media
[22:54.480 --> 22:55.920]  so that they can paint the picture they want.
[22:55.920 --> 22:57.600]  They cheat by rigging elections
[22:58.440 --> 23:01.440]  so they can get the candidates in that they own.
[23:03.320 --> 23:05.200]  So no, humans really want to be free.
[23:05.200 --> 23:06.640]  Humans don't want to wear the mask.
[23:06.640 --> 23:07.520]  They're being deceived.
[23:07.520 --> 23:08.840]  They're being tricked.
[23:08.840 --> 23:10.720]  They're being goose-stepped into slavery.
[23:12.480 --> 23:15.560]  But again, I can't even get past level one
[23:15.560 --> 23:19.200]  because I'm stuck here tied to these dumber-than-rock liberals
[23:19.200 --> 23:21.480]  who want men to compete in women's sports,
[23:22.880 --> 23:25.080]  who don't want to have a border,
[23:25.080 --> 23:26.880]  who have overflow facilities now
[23:26.880 --> 23:29.400]  of migrants testing positive for COVID-19,
[23:29.400 --> 23:30.800]  but they say you can't go to church,
[23:30.800 --> 23:31.880]  you can't go to a ballgame,
[23:31.880 --> 23:34.400]  and you have to mask up if you're in Austin, Texas.
[23:35.320 --> 23:36.360]  It's insanity.
[23:36.360 --> 23:39.000]  I don't know how much longer we can take this, folks.
[23:39.000 --> 23:41.400]  I'm at my wit's end.
[23:43.000 --> 23:45.400]  Stanford medical professor says lockdowns
[23:45.400 --> 23:48.720]  were the worst public health mistake in last 100 years.
[23:48.720 --> 23:53.720]  No kidding, except maybe for the mask,
[23:55.600 --> 23:58.320]  which all the science says spreads disease.
[23:58.320 --> 24:01.120]  Ohio School District will require students and teachers
[24:01.120 --> 24:02.680]  to wear double masks.
[24:02.680 --> 24:03.520]  That's nice.
[24:03.520 --> 24:05.360]  So really breathing in the carbon dioxide.
[24:05.360 --> 24:10.360]  Again, I don't want to be somebody that's a divider.
[24:10.880 --> 24:12.360]  I want to be a unifier,
[24:12.360 --> 24:15.320]  but I can only get people to unify behind truth and reality.
[24:15.320 --> 24:17.680]  I'm not gonna unify people on a lie,
[24:17.680 --> 24:19.080]  and I'm not going to,
[24:20.400 --> 24:23.600]  I'm not going to unify with a lie.
[24:23.600 --> 24:28.240]  I'm not going to attach myself to a lie.
[24:29.680 --> 24:33.600]  So I'm sorry if my language comes off as divisive,
[24:33.600 --> 24:34.640]  it's just true.
[24:34.640 --> 24:37.880]  Liberals are dumber than rocks.
[24:37.880 --> 24:39.520]  A rock is neutral at IQ.
[24:39.520 --> 24:40.880]  A liberal IQ is negative.
[24:40.880 --> 24:42.840]  A liberal answers questions wrong.
[24:42.840 --> 24:46.400]  A liberal actually has misinformation and disinformation.
[24:46.400 --> 24:47.840]  A rock is just neutral.
[24:47.840 --> 24:48.960]  You ask a rock,
[24:48.960 --> 24:50.680]  should men compete in women's sports?
[24:50.680 --> 24:51.600]  It has no answer.
[24:51.600 --> 24:53.720]  You ask a liberal, it says yes.
[24:54.880 --> 24:58.200]  You ask a rock, should humans wear a face mask
[24:58.200 --> 24:59.120]  to protect from COVID?
[24:59.120 --> 24:59.960]  It's neutral.
[24:59.960 --> 25:00.960]  You ask a liberal, I don't know.
[25:00.960 --> 25:03.160]  You should wear two, three masks even.
[25:03.160 --> 25:04.880]  See, that's negative IQ.
[25:08.760 --> 25:11.560]  Apparently, Star Wars has a rock as a character now.
[25:11.560 --> 25:12.720]  Smarter than a liberal.
[25:14.280 --> 25:15.760]  A rock is smarter than a liberal.
[25:15.760 --> 25:16.600]  Congratulations.
[25:16.600 --> 25:18.400]  Dumber than a rock is now a real thing.
[25:23.960 --> 25:27.560]  But seriously, how can you have
[25:27.560 --> 25:31.120]  such a twisted and contorted ideology
[25:32.080 --> 25:34.760]  that thinks carbon dioxide is killing the planet
[25:36.080 --> 25:39.880]  but then will tell humans to wear double masks
[25:39.880 --> 25:43.040]  that forces them to breathe in carbon dioxide all day long?
[25:43.040 --> 25:44.720]  And I'm not going to sit here and do it.
[25:44.720 --> 25:46.800]  I've done it three, four times on air
[25:46.800 --> 25:49.360]  where I sit here with the masks, two masks, three masks,
[25:49.360 --> 25:52.520]  and I have the carbon dioxide reader in my mask
[25:52.520 --> 25:54.080]  to tell me how much carbon dioxide.
[25:54.080 --> 25:55.200]  It's toxic levels, folks.
[25:55.200 --> 25:58.720]  I mean, you're breathing in toxic carbon dioxide,
[25:58.720 --> 26:03.480]  dangerous levels within minutes of wearing the double mask.
[26:03.480 --> 26:06.840]  So these people are doing permanent damage
[26:06.840 --> 26:08.200]  to their bodies
[26:08.200 --> 26:10.680]  when they're sitting there sucking CO2 all day.
[26:10.680 --> 26:13.200]  Now, who knows when it'll finally catch,
[26:13.200 --> 26:15.320]  it'll finally be a problem for them.
[26:15.320 --> 26:16.840]  Could be five years, could be 10 years.
[26:16.840 --> 26:20.160]  Maybe it's unnoticeable for the most part.
[26:20.160 --> 26:22.440]  The point is, by their logic,
[26:23.800 --> 26:26.680]  carbon dioxide is killing the planet
[26:26.680 --> 26:29.440]  and yet they want you to breathe in carbon dioxide
[26:29.440 --> 26:30.440]  all day long.
[26:30.440 --> 26:32.720]  So save the planet for humans,
[26:32.720 --> 26:34.640]  cut carbon dioxide emissions,
[26:34.640 --> 26:36.400]  even though the planet needs carbon
[26:36.400 --> 26:38.280]  in a carbon life cycle to exist.
[26:38.280 --> 26:39.920]  We now have new studies about that
[26:39.920 --> 26:42.240]  with volcanoes forming atmospheres.
[26:42.240 --> 26:43.080]  Go figure.
[26:44.280 --> 26:47.520]  But no, they wanna destroy the carbon life cycle,
[26:47.520 --> 26:49.560]  make you breathe in the deadly carbon dioxide
[26:49.560 --> 26:50.400]  all day long,
[26:50.400 --> 26:51.560]  and they think that's low.
[26:51.560 --> 26:52.440]  They think that's smart.
[26:52.440 --> 26:54.040]  No, you're dumber than a rock.
[26:54.040 --> 26:57.680]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[26:57.680 --> 26:59.840]  The population has been trained to submit
[26:59.840 --> 27:02.240]  to what you're told and it's all gonna pass.
[27:02.240 --> 27:04.160]  But if you study authoritarians,
[27:04.160 --> 27:05.000]  if you study the globalists,
[27:05.000 --> 27:06.600]  you understand that they reach a point
[27:06.600 --> 27:08.560]  where all the training is just beta
[27:08.560 --> 27:10.160]  and you go into the point of being cold,
[27:10.160 --> 27:11.440]  being totally enslaved.
[27:11.440 --> 27:13.200]  And because the globalists see us as weak
[27:13.200 --> 27:14.320]  and see us as stupid,
[27:14.320 --> 27:15.880]  they are now making that move.
[27:15.880 --> 27:17.800]  And they are collapsing the third world
[27:17.800 --> 27:19.120]  with their economic weapons
[27:19.120 --> 27:21.000]  to then flood us with the third world
[27:21.000 --> 27:23.600]  that the UN will use as a weapon
[27:23.600 --> 27:25.680]  to then have us under such a crisis,
[27:25.680 --> 27:26.760]  under such a load,
[27:26.760 --> 27:28.440]  capitulate to the UN,
[27:28.440 --> 27:30.200]  whatever agreements they want us to sign,
[27:30.200 --> 27:32.040]  hoping that they will stop the flood
[27:32.040 --> 27:33.960]  of tens of millions of refugees,
[27:33.960 --> 27:37.080]  not fleeing COVID or climate change
[27:37.080 --> 27:39.080]  as the UN and Klaus Schwab are saying,
[27:39.080 --> 27:40.120]  and Bill Gates is saying,
[27:40.120 --> 27:43.120]  but fleeing the year-long lockdowns
[27:43.120 --> 27:46.440]  that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute
[27:46.440 --> 27:49.800]  or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money.
[27:49.800 --> 27:52.560]  And that's why we have to really get educated
[27:52.560 --> 27:53.760]  about the globalists.
[27:53.760 --> 27:57.800]  The general public has finally figured out why I'm upset.
[27:57.800 --> 27:59.000]  They figured out that the globalists
[27:59.000 --> 28:00.800]  are literally trying to kill us.
[28:00.800 --> 28:03.320]  They're trying to take over civilization and society.
[28:03.320 --> 28:06.400]  And they depend on the public being ignorant.
[28:06.400 --> 28:07.240]  That's what Jesus said,
[28:07.240 --> 28:09.920]  my people perish for lack of knowledge.
[28:09.920 --> 28:11.560]  Knowledge is power.
[28:11.560 --> 28:14.280]  Like our bodies are made up of all these tissues
[28:14.280 --> 28:16.360]  and all these systems that die
[28:16.360 --> 28:19.160]  without essential vitamins and minerals.
[28:19.160 --> 28:20.400]  And that's why they don't want you to know
[28:20.400 --> 28:22.320]  about essential vitamins and minerals
[28:22.320 --> 28:23.480]  because it's so simple
[28:23.480 --> 28:25.400]  because you won't be under their control anymore.
[28:25.400 --> 28:27.120]  Well, the vitamin mineral fusion,
[28:27.120 --> 28:30.280]  the highest quality vitamin mineral fusion system out there
[28:30.280 --> 28:32.960]  in a liquid vitamin form is now back in stock
[28:32.960 --> 28:34.280]  at infowarstore.com.
[28:34.280 --> 28:36.520]  And it's not just an incredible formula at a great price.
[28:36.520 --> 28:39.600]  It funds the info war at the same time.
[28:39.600 --> 28:42.000]  No other product you can buy does that.
[28:42.000 --> 28:45.040]  So again, infowarstore.com, it's back in stock,
[28:45.040 --> 28:47.080]  50% off vitamin mineral fusion.
[28:47.080 --> 28:49.440]  I'm gonna keep it at that until it sells out.
[28:49.440 --> 28:50.600]  So take action today
[28:50.600 --> 28:53.560]  and give it to your friends and family as a gift.
[28:53.560 --> 28:55.960]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[28:55.960 --> 28:57.600]  It's very bittersweet.
[28:57.600 --> 28:59.040]  Everything we've talked about has happened
[28:59.040 --> 29:00.640]  just like we said it would.
[29:00.640 --> 29:01.920]  And now we have a lot of credibility,
[29:01.920 --> 29:02.840]  but I don't care about that.
[29:02.840 --> 29:04.880]  I care about beating the new world order.
[29:04.880 --> 29:06.680]  And it's because we have so much credibility,
[29:06.680 --> 29:09.560]  they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[29:09.560 --> 29:10.800]  And I don't have time to tell you
[29:10.800 --> 29:12.280]  all the stuff they're doing to us.
[29:12.280 --> 29:14.480]  For a lot of reasons, I can't tell you what's going on.
[29:14.480 --> 29:15.680]  But let's just say this,
[29:15.680 --> 29:17.400]  we're gonna see this through to the end.
[29:17.400 --> 29:20.040]  We're gonna stay on air as long as we can.
[29:20.040 --> 29:22.600]  So please pray for us and please buy the products.
[29:22.600 --> 29:24.760]  And then infowarstore.com, they're great products.
[29:24.760 --> 29:26.240]  Plus they fund the operation.
[29:26.240 --> 29:28.440]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy,
[29:28.440 --> 29:29.480]  they're still great.
[29:29.480 --> 29:30.320]  Do they fund freedom?
[29:30.320 --> 29:31.440]  No, a lot of them don't.
[29:31.440 --> 29:35.160]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice
[29:35.160 --> 29:37.880]  when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[29:37.880 --> 29:39.640]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[29:39.640 --> 29:41.240]  They can't bring in all this tyranny
[29:41.240 --> 29:43.040]  and leave people like us on the air.
[29:43.040 --> 29:43.880]  So while you're at it,
[29:43.880 --> 29:46.160]  don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[29:46.160 --> 29:47.640]  Download everything we've done.
[29:47.640 --> 29:48.960]  You can find and save it.
[29:48.960 --> 29:51.120]  Cause who knows how long we're gonna be on the air
[29:51.120 --> 29:53.920]  and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[29:56.880 --> 29:59.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[29:59.960 --> 30:04.960]  The Alex Jones Show
[30:04.960 --> 30:06.960]  The Alex Jones Show
[30:06.960 --> 30:08.960]  The Alex Jones Show
[30:08.960 --> 30:10.960]  The Alex Jones Show
[30:10.960 --> 30:12.960]  The Alex Jones Show
[30:12.960 --> 30:14.960]  The Alex Jones Show
[30:14.960 --> 30:16.960]  The Alex Jones Show
[30:16.960 --> 30:18.960]  All right, we're back here live on the Alex Jones show.
[30:18.960 --> 30:21.960]  We're gonna be here in Cromalix coming up in the next hour.
[30:21.960 --> 30:24.960]  I'm trying to remain calm here, but I just can't do it.
[30:24.960 --> 30:26.960]  I really can barely even focus and cover this news.
[30:26.960 --> 30:28.960]  I'm just so sick of the Democrat tyranny.
[30:28.960 --> 30:30.960]  I'm just so sick of the Democrat tyranny.
[30:30.960 --> 30:32.960]  And just all their lies.
[30:32.960 --> 30:36.960]  It's just everything that the Democrats base their policy off of is lies.
[30:36.960 --> 30:38.960]  Everything.
[30:38.960 --> 30:40.960]  Double standards and lies.
[30:40.960 --> 30:43.960]  And then just a complete denial of reality.
[30:43.960 --> 30:44.960]  Like for example,
[30:44.960 --> 30:46.960]  Mexican president says Biden border policies
[30:46.960 --> 30:49.960]  encouraging illegal immigration and enriching cartels.
[30:49.960 --> 30:50.960]  Well, everybody knew that.
[30:50.960 --> 30:53.960]  I mean, I shouldn't have to sit here and be like, wow, thank God.
[30:53.960 --> 30:56.960]  The Mexican president is telling the truth.
[30:56.960 --> 30:57.960]  But we already know that.
[30:57.960 --> 30:59.960]  It's just the Democrats lie.
[30:59.960 --> 31:00.960]  That's all they do.
[31:00.960 --> 31:01.960]  They lie about the border.
[31:01.960 --> 31:02.960]  They lie about COVID.
[31:02.960 --> 31:04.960]  They lie about everything, man.
[31:04.960 --> 31:10.960]  Every damn thing is a lie coming out of the Democrats' mouths.
[31:10.960 --> 31:14.960]  And it's just disgusting.
[31:14.960 --> 31:17.960]  What they're doing to our country, what they're doing to humanity,
[31:17.960 --> 31:19.960]  it's just disgusting.
[31:19.960 --> 31:21.960]  Again, oh, Trump's putting kids in cages.
[31:21.960 --> 31:25.960]  Actually, the cages that you said Trump was putting kids into,
[31:25.960 --> 31:27.960]  Trump shut down that facility.
[31:27.960 --> 31:29.960]  Biden just reopened it.
[31:29.960 --> 31:33.960]  But it's called a reception center now, don't you see?
[31:33.960 --> 31:36.960]  Because the Democrats lie.
[31:36.960 --> 31:41.960]  They lied about kids in cages and they're lying about the border now.
[31:41.960 --> 31:43.960]  Another big lie.
[31:43.960 --> 31:46.960]  Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd.
[31:46.960 --> 31:48.960]  That's a big lie.
[31:48.960 --> 31:56.960]  But see, I don't know why anybody, honestly, I mean, I know why,
[31:56.960 --> 31:58.960]  and it's sad this is the state of things,
[31:58.960 --> 32:01.960]  but why would anybody want to be a police officer now?
[32:01.960 --> 32:05.960]  If the media decides you're guilty as a police officer, you're dead.
[32:05.960 --> 32:10.960]  It doesn't matter if you had deadly amounts of fentanyl or methamphetamine
[32:10.960 --> 32:13.960]  in your system, you're dead by cop.
[32:13.960 --> 32:14.960]  Because the media decided.
[32:14.960 --> 32:16.960]  The Democrats decided.
[32:16.960 --> 32:18.960]  So Chauvin's fate has already been decided.
[32:18.960 --> 32:23.960]  It doesn't matter we have the autopsy, no life-threatening injuries on the autopsy,
[32:23.960 --> 32:28.960]  and three different drugs, two types of fentanyl and methamphetamine
[32:28.960 --> 32:35.960]  found in Floyd's system, a lethal dose, a lethal dose, a lethal dose.
[32:35.960 --> 32:40.960]  So Chauvin used the police tactics he was trained to use,
[32:40.960 --> 32:45.960]  whether you agree with that or not,
[32:45.960 --> 32:49.960]  George Floyd, who was doing drugs in the police vehicle, had drugs on him,
[32:49.960 --> 32:54.960]  asked to be taken out of the police vehicle because he was having an overdose event,
[32:54.960 --> 32:58.960]  and then died while he was on the ground, and now Chauvin is the murderer,
[32:58.960 --> 33:02.960]  and the media still says Floyd's killer, Floyd's killer, all the stories,
[33:02.960 --> 33:05.960]  Floyd's killer, Floyd's killer, Floyd's killer.
[33:05.960 --> 33:07.960]  What, fentanyl?
[33:07.960 --> 33:09.960]  No, Chauvin.
[33:09.960 --> 33:15.960]  And so that judge that you're looking at right there has reinstated third-degree murder chart.
[33:15.960 --> 33:19.960]  So the charges fell through for obvious reasons.
[33:19.960 --> 33:22.960]  Floyd was a criminal, and he overdosed on three different drugs.
[33:22.960 --> 33:27.960]  But no, that judge wants to reinstate third-degree murder because here's why.
[33:27.960 --> 33:34.960]  Just like all the jurors were saying, the judge feels the same way.
[33:34.960 --> 33:45.960]  If Derek Chauvin does not go to jail for his life, Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota will burn to the ground.
[33:45.960 --> 33:52.960]  Now tell me, why would you want to be a police officer knowing that the Democrat terrorist party
[33:52.960 --> 33:58.960]  is going to threaten to burn a city to the ground if a judge doesn't put you in jail,
[33:58.960 --> 34:00.960]  if jurors don't put you in jail?
[34:00.960 --> 34:04.960]  Why would anybody want to be a police officer knowing that as soon as the Democrats could,
[34:04.960 --> 34:10.960]  they'll put you in jail for nothing?
[34:10.960 --> 34:15.960]  So, well, it's not from nothing, George Floyd died.
[34:15.960 --> 34:16.960]  Yeah, he died that day.
[34:16.960 --> 34:18.960]  He overdosed on drugs.
[34:18.960 --> 34:19.960]  That's very sad.
[34:19.960 --> 34:20.960]  He wasn't cooperating with police.
[34:20.960 --> 34:21.960]  I wish he didn't die.
[34:21.960 --> 34:23.960]  I wish Chauvin didn't have his boot on his neck.
[34:23.960 --> 34:26.960]  I bet Chauvin feels the same way.
[34:26.960 --> 34:28.960]  But what are you supposed to do, Floyd's a criminal.
[34:28.960 --> 34:29.960]  He's overdosing on drugs.
[34:29.960 --> 34:31.960]  He has to be removed from the police vehicle.
[34:31.960 --> 34:32.960]  He's not cooperating.
[34:32.960 --> 34:34.960]  He just goes with his training.
[34:34.960 --> 34:35.960]  Floyd dies of a drug overdose.
[34:35.960 --> 34:38.960]  Now Chauvin's life is ruined.
[34:38.960 --> 34:39.960]  And he will go to jail for life.
[34:39.960 --> 34:40.960]  You watch.
[34:40.960 --> 34:41.960]  There isn't a jury.
[34:41.960 --> 34:47.960]  There is not a jury in America that you could find right now that would actually want to
[34:47.960 --> 34:50.960]  be on that case and actually say that Chauvin didn't kill Floyd.
[34:50.960 --> 34:54.960]  And as they said during the questioning, they said, yeah, I don't want to be a part of this.
[34:54.960 --> 34:58.960]  They're going to burn my house to the ground.
[34:58.960 --> 35:06.200]  And now you have a George Floyd Autonomous Zone in Minneapolis just waiting for the Floyd
[35:06.200 --> 35:08.960]  decision so that they can burn that city to the ground.
[35:08.960 --> 35:15.040]  And you watch, even if Chauvin is found guilty of third-degree murder and thrown in jail immediately
[35:15.040 --> 35:20.640]  without the key, they'll still burn that city to the ground.
[35:20.640 --> 35:22.960]  They will still burn Minneapolis to the ground.
[35:22.960 --> 35:23.960]  Why?
[35:23.960 --> 35:27.560]  Because these are terrorists that we're dealing with.
[35:27.560 --> 35:29.560]  So yeah, they've occupied Minneapolis.
[35:29.560 --> 35:32.320]  Yeah, they're holding the gun.
[35:32.320 --> 35:36.880]  They're holding a flamethrower to Minneapolis' head right now.
[35:36.880 --> 35:39.040]  Because what is the definition of terrorism?
[35:39.040 --> 35:43.600]  Using violence to accomplish your political agenda.
[35:43.600 --> 35:48.120]  That is the very definition of every Democrat Party tactic.
[35:48.120 --> 35:51.280]  The Democrat Party is the biggest terror group in the United States of America.
[35:51.280 --> 35:54.760]  A Democrat in Congress or on TV is lying to you.
[35:54.760 --> 36:00.920]  Those are two facts that need to be seared into our very consciousness.
[36:00.920 --> 36:05.960]  So now the entire city of Minneapolis is being held hostage by Democrat terrorists.
[36:05.960 --> 36:14.040]  And George Floyd, who died of a drug overdose, is the excuse that they're using.
[36:14.040 --> 36:18.200]  So why would anybody want to be a police officer knowing that the Democrat terrorist Party
[36:18.200 --> 36:22.880]  will threaten to burn cities to the ground if you're not put in jail for doing your job?
[36:22.880 --> 36:27.200]  Well, it's the same old why, because everybody needs a job.
[36:27.200 --> 36:29.560]  Everybody needs to get that paycheck.
[36:29.560 --> 36:32.920]  So it's sad that that's the case.
[36:32.920 --> 36:36.440]  But that is the case.
[36:36.440 --> 36:37.440]  And you know what?
[36:37.440 --> 36:40.280]  Most of these police officers are actually good people.
[36:40.280 --> 36:46.280]  Actually maybe want to help their communities, keep criminals off the streets.
[36:46.280 --> 36:50.120]  But boy, oh boy, I'll tell you, it is all falling apart.
[36:50.120 --> 36:58.800]  And I think that what happens with this Chauvin thing is going to crescendo into many police,
[36:58.800 --> 37:03.840]  perhaps quitting, walking away, and not wanting to use force.
[37:03.840 --> 37:07.480]  And it's funny because they say, oh, you know, police are racist against black people or
[37:07.480 --> 37:08.480]  whatever.
[37:08.480 --> 37:09.480]  Let me tell you something.
[37:09.480 --> 37:14.080]  A police officer probably wants to not do deal with black people at all right now.
[37:14.080 --> 37:16.760]  Not because they're racist, but because they know the media is going to come after them
[37:16.760 --> 37:20.760]  and call them racist, and that could result in their city being burnt to the ground by
[37:20.760 --> 37:22.400]  Democrats.
[37:22.400 --> 37:26.320]  So believe me, you're a police officer and you see a white guy, you're not as, you're
[37:26.320 --> 37:29.600]  more comfortable knowing that you could probably, you know, smash that guy's head on the ground
[37:29.600 --> 37:31.840]  and kill him and the media wouldn't even blink an eye.
[37:31.840 --> 37:36.000]  Whereas if it was a black guy, you know, you scrape him the wrong way and the media is going
[37:36.000 --> 37:39.600]  to make sure that you have, your life is miserable.
[37:39.600 --> 37:44.920]  So yeah, you really think cops are going around targeting black people?
[37:44.920 --> 37:45.920]  No.
[37:45.920 --> 37:47.960]  This is the exact opposite.
[37:47.960 --> 37:52.680]  Believe me, a white police officer does not want to deal with a black person right now
[37:52.680 --> 37:55.880]  because they know what could happen if things go wrong.
[37:55.880 --> 38:03.960]  Their life is over because Democrat terrorists will threaten to burn their city to the ground.
[38:03.960 --> 38:07.440]  And so this is where we're at in America.
[38:07.440 --> 38:14.520]  But oh, the Washington Post is complaining that Tucker Carlson's false accusations, which
[38:14.520 --> 38:19.960]  aren't false, by the way, they were true, but they say Tucker Carlson's false accusations
[38:19.960 --> 38:21.880]  put main journalists under siege.
[38:21.880 --> 38:26.280]  Oh, wait, you mean fake news can ruin people's lives?
[38:26.280 --> 38:27.840]  Wow.
[38:27.840 --> 38:30.880]  So the Washington Post admits that they've ruined people's lives.
[38:30.880 --> 38:33.680]  Yeah, fake news can ruin people's lives.
[38:33.680 --> 38:35.960]  Look at what happened in Minneapolis.
[38:35.960 --> 38:38.240]  Look at what happened in Kenosha.
[38:38.240 --> 38:39.640]  Jacob Blake wasn't armed.
[38:39.640 --> 38:40.840]  Yeah, he was.
[38:40.840 --> 38:41.840]  He admitted it.
[38:41.840 --> 38:43.880]  He said he'd regretted it.
[38:43.880 --> 38:44.880]  The big lie.
[38:44.880 --> 38:45.880]  Burnt Kenosha to the ground.
[38:45.880 --> 38:47.480]  Michael Brown, hands up, don't shoot.
[38:47.480 --> 38:48.480]  Never happened.
[38:48.480 --> 38:49.480]  The big lie.
[38:49.480 --> 38:50.480]  Ferguson, Missouri.
[38:50.480 --> 38:51.480]  Weeks on end.
[38:51.480 --> 38:53.880]  Burnt to the ground.
[38:53.880 --> 38:54.880]  Another Democrat.
[38:54.880 --> 38:55.880]  Big lie.
[38:55.880 --> 38:58.520]  So yeah, you're right, Washington Post.
[38:58.520 --> 39:02.720]  Fake news does have real world implications.
[39:02.720 --> 39:06.760]  And you are the leading sponsor.
[39:06.760 --> 39:09.800]  Look at all the Trump supporters that got harassed and attacked in the streets.
[39:09.800 --> 39:13.120]  Their hats ripped off their head, punched, bloodied.
[39:13.120 --> 39:14.120]  Why?
[39:14.120 --> 39:19.600]  Because your fake news said they were racist and Nazis.
[39:19.600 --> 39:20.600]  So where does it go from here?
[39:20.600 --> 39:22.200]  I'm going to try to, I'm going to try to focus.
[39:22.200 --> 39:24.000]  Alex is coming up in the next hour.
[39:24.000 --> 39:31.560]  I just, it's just this intellectual hurdle that I'm just struggling because until, until
[39:31.560 --> 39:36.720]  we as a nation can accept the reality of this, that the Democrat Party is the largest terror
[39:36.720 --> 39:38.720]  group and hate group in America.
[39:38.720 --> 39:44.560]  And that Democrats and liberals on TV are lying to you until we can understand that
[39:44.560 --> 39:45.640]  and move on from that.
[39:45.640 --> 39:46.960]  This is never going to get any better.
[39:46.960 --> 39:50.920]  And they're literally talking about a hologram Biden now to do press conferences because
[39:50.920 --> 39:52.920]  Biden can't even talk.
[39:52.920 --> 39:57.400]  As you know, we're always upping our game at M Full Wars and we brought you a new supplement,

[40:03.840 --> 40:06.880]  We mean down in your bed, sleeping hard throughout the night.

[41:00.600 --> 41:03.800]  But let me tell you, the new world orders breathe them down our neck.
[41:03.800 --> 41:06.880]  The big globalist publications are coming after us and they're doing everything they

[41:08.200 --> 41:12.520]  So please pray to keep info wars on the air and please support the local station you're

[41:26.000 --> 41:28.120]  I need your help more than ever now.
[41:28.120 --> 41:32.440]  I want to keep fighting the globalist, but I can't do it if you don't support us.

[42:06.640 --> 42:10.800]  Lizards get confused when they hear me talk about the fact that the supply chain's breaking
[42:10.800 --> 42:17.680]  down and its future orders, its product we're trying to reorder to get back in that we're
[42:17.680 --> 42:18.680]  having trouble with.
[42:18.680 --> 42:24.320]  I mean, I'm talking about double, triple, quadruple delivery times, and it's across.
[42:24.320 --> 42:27.680]  Not just the supplement, vitamin, mineral industry, it's across every industry.
[42:27.680 --> 42:32.480]  So the globalists have successfully devastated the economy.
[42:32.480 --> 42:36.800]  That's why I'm saying, you need to visit infowarstore.com today and get high quality supplements while
[42:36.800 --> 42:42.440]  you still can, and storeable food at infowarstore.com because we have it in stock, it's ready to
[42:42.440 --> 42:43.440]  ship.
[42:43.440 --> 42:47.960]  But with the supply chain breakdowns, prices are going up, availability is going down,
[42:47.960 --> 42:49.200]  and it's just crazy.
[42:49.200 --> 43:18.720]  So please get products while you still can and support the infowarstore.com.
[43:18.720 --> 43:26.280]  That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it, but Storos and Bill Gates
[43:26.280 --> 43:35.200]  and the globalists are on our tail, but the new website is theresistance.video, theresistance.video.
[43:35.200 --> 43:39.600]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can't compete with it.
[43:39.600 --> 43:44.840]  So the new URL that links right to banned.video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries
[43:44.840 --> 43:49.840]  and all the special reports and all the suppressed information is that theresistance.video.
[43:49.840 --> 43:57.080]  Share the link, theresistance.video, theresistance.video.
[43:57.080 --> 44:02.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:02.760 --> 44:15.680]  Alright, I'm ranting here, so I'm going to try to focus and lay out all this news in
[44:15.680 --> 44:20.680]  a more concise and clear and connected manner.
[44:20.680 --> 44:31.760]  But like I said, the foundation of most of this news that's so incredible is the same
[44:31.760 --> 44:38.000]  thing across the board, which is Democrat party policy is all based on lies.
[44:38.000 --> 44:41.000]  It's all based on lies, every damn thing.
[44:41.000 --> 44:46.960]  So you can make up your reason as to why Democrats and their media cohorts lie all the time.
[44:46.960 --> 44:48.480]  You can make up your own reason.
[44:48.480 --> 44:50.360]  Are they consciously in a death cult?
[44:50.360 --> 44:53.280]  Are they brainwashing into a death cult?
[44:53.280 --> 44:57.400]  I don't know what's going on with all of it.
[44:57.400 --> 45:00.080]  I do, but I don't.
[45:00.080 --> 45:05.040]  So I'm going to try to lay out the rest of this news here and stop ranting and raving
[45:05.040 --> 45:06.040]  about it.
[45:06.040 --> 45:10.960]  But it's just true and the Democrat party is in the process of destroying the United
[45:10.960 --> 45:13.800]  States of America right now.
[45:13.800 --> 45:17.200]  And if freedom dies in the West, if freedom dies in the United States of America, freedom
[45:17.200 --> 45:19.560]  dies worldwide.
[45:19.560 --> 45:21.720]  And so I just hope that the Democrats are proud of themselves.
[45:21.720 --> 45:23.840]  I hope everybody that voted for Biden is proud of themselves.
[45:23.840 --> 45:24.840]  Of course they're not.
[45:24.840 --> 45:28.880]  If you can even find anybody that did, I just hope all these liberals that promote men
[45:28.880 --> 45:32.400]  competing with women, hope all these liberals that want to take the guns, hope all these
[45:32.400 --> 45:35.680]  liberals cancelling free speech, hope all these liberals calling America racist and
[45:35.680 --> 45:36.680]  all this stuff.
[45:36.680 --> 45:40.320]  You know, I just hope you're going to be happy when you're a slave in a camp.
[45:40.320 --> 45:41.320]  All right?
[45:41.320 --> 45:44.280]  Just know you did this to yourself.
[45:44.280 --> 45:47.280]  You think you're miserable now in your pathetic existence.
[45:47.280 --> 45:50.920]  Wait till you are a complete slave.
[45:50.920 --> 45:52.960]  You love your little mask.
[45:52.960 --> 45:54.840]  You love having people shut down their business.
[45:54.840 --> 45:56.760]  You think it's all fun and games.
[45:56.760 --> 46:06.080]  So you are going to have a rude awakening indeed now.
[46:06.080 --> 46:10.680]  Nobody else will tell it like it is as Infowars does.
[46:10.680 --> 46:11.680]  You know that.
[46:11.680 --> 46:14.400]  That's why you're tuned in today.
[46:14.400 --> 46:20.720]  But as you know, the attacks against Infowars are stronger than ever.
[46:20.720 --> 46:22.960]  But that's also made us stronger than ever.
[46:22.960 --> 46:31.400]  That's made you stronger than ever in the resistance to the New World Order takeover.
[46:31.400 --> 46:36.480]  And none of it would be possible, like for example, see, I can't even, I can't even
[46:36.480 --> 46:41.080]  have the crew do this when I'm talking about InfowarsStore.com, but it's like, it's just
[46:41.080 --> 46:42.080]  going insane.
[46:42.080 --> 46:45.320]  Private school says phrases like mom and dad should be avoided.
[46:45.320 --> 46:46.320]  What?
[46:46.320 --> 46:48.640]  Oh, that's bigoted.
[46:48.640 --> 46:49.800]  You're insane.
[46:49.800 --> 46:54.480]  People are a mental patient if you believe that, but that's what Democrats are.
[46:54.480 --> 46:56.040]  Liberalism is a mental disorder.
[46:56.040 --> 47:01.160]  I mean, these are mental patients that are now, the mental patients are now running the
[47:01.160 --> 47:04.160]  funny farm.
[47:04.160 --> 47:05.160]  So excuse me.
[47:05.160 --> 47:06.520]  See, I'm telling you, I can't even concentrate, man.
[47:06.520 --> 47:08.600]  It's just so out of control.
[47:08.600 --> 47:13.400]  Got liberals running around masks in Austin, even though it's, you know, the mandates up.
[47:13.400 --> 47:14.400]  They love it.
[47:14.400 --> 47:15.400]  It's a political statement.
[47:15.400 --> 47:18.920]  They love their slavery because they want to make you a slave with them.
[47:18.920 --> 47:20.120]  That's what they really hate.
[47:20.120 --> 47:22.840]  They really hate the free American individual that doesn't want to be a slave.
[47:22.840 --> 47:24.880]  Yeah, I was going to cover this coming up.
[47:24.880 --> 47:28.040]  In fact, well, I'll cover that.
[47:28.040 --> 47:32.040]  Guys, put up infowarstore.com because if you keep putting these headlines on air, I'm
[47:32.040 --> 47:34.160]  not going to be able to concentrate.

[48:06.200 --> 48:07.720]  I like all three of the Sleep Aids.

[48:44.600 --> 48:46.560]  like DNA Force Plus and others.
[48:46.560 --> 48:47.560]  So that's back in stock.
[48:47.560 --> 48:55.640]  But two days left of free shipping, two days left of free shipping at infowarstore.com.
[48:55.640 --> 49:02.000]  All right, Alex is going to be joining us coming up in the next hour.
[49:02.000 --> 49:03.640]  What news do I want to get into?
[49:03.640 --> 49:06.760]  Let me just pick this stack up.
[49:06.760 --> 49:10.400]  And Trump drops a truth bomb on Joe Biden's outrageous attempt to take credit for Trump's
[49:10.400 --> 49:15.000]  Operation Warp Speed Vaccine, which I don't really understand why the president is putting
[49:15.000 --> 49:16.000]  this out there.
[49:16.000 --> 49:20.240]  I don't get the game wanting to claim this vaccine and all of it as his own when it's
[49:20.240 --> 49:23.880]  going to start killing people and then they'll use it against him.
[49:23.880 --> 49:26.720]  So we'll see how that turns out.
[49:26.720 --> 49:29.200]  But Biden had another live press conference.
[49:29.200 --> 49:35.760]  To his credit, this was his largest live audience since being installed into the White House
[49:35.760 --> 49:36.760]  for Biden.
[49:36.760 --> 49:39.400]  He had 1,000 people watching.
[49:39.400 --> 49:45.000]  This was Biden's biggest live audience for any live stream event he's done since being
[49:45.000 --> 49:47.040]  installed into the White House.
[49:47.040 --> 49:48.040]  Just over 1,000 people.
[49:48.040 --> 49:51.760]  Wow, very impressive from the guy that got 81 million votes.
[49:51.760 --> 49:56.040]  Yeah, I'm sure, I'm sure.
[49:56.040 --> 50:03.800]  Now funny enough, there's a stream from, I think it's Big Bear Valley is the name of
[50:03.800 --> 50:04.800]  it.
[50:04.800 --> 50:07.600]  I have a stream of a bald eagle's nest.
[50:07.600 --> 50:16.120]  Guys, if you pull this up, get this, the live stream of a bald eagle's nest on average
[50:16.120 --> 50:23.720]  gets at least double, most of times quadruple, the amount of live audience Joe Biden gets.
[50:23.720 --> 50:24.720]  Think about that.
[50:24.720 --> 50:27.080]  Now, I got to admit, that's pretty cool, right?
[50:27.080 --> 50:30.720]  I was watching this last night for longer than I'd like to admit.
[50:30.720 --> 50:36.000]  Bald eagle, you have shadow, the male, and then, what was the name of the female?
[50:36.000 --> 50:37.560]  I forget the name of the female.
[50:37.560 --> 50:44.280]  So you've got over 4,300 people tuned into the Big Bear bald eagle cam.
[50:44.280 --> 50:54.360]  So on average, a bald eagle nesting, a bald eagle nesting, gets four times the audience
[50:54.360 --> 50:59.080]  of the supposed president of the United States.
[50:59.080 --> 51:01.000]  Think about that.
[51:01.000 --> 51:03.800]  A bald eagle nesting.
[51:03.800 --> 51:07.200]  So this video right now that we're tuned into, which again, I mean, it's pretty badass.
[51:07.200 --> 51:08.720]  I mean, look at that thing.
[51:08.720 --> 51:12.600]  And you could see it last night, there was a really bad like wind storm.
[51:12.600 --> 51:16.240]  You see it like burying itself, nestling in with the eggs.
[51:16.240 --> 51:23.120]  So a bald eagle live stream gets more audience than Joe Biden addressing the nation during
[51:23.120 --> 51:27.280]  the deadliest pandemic in human history, supposedly.
[51:27.280 --> 51:29.480]  What does that tell you?
[51:29.480 --> 51:34.120]  I think it says a whole lot.
[51:34.120 --> 51:38.640]  And the fake president who doesn't even know where he is is going to sign the $2 trillion
[51:38.640 --> 51:39.640]  stimulus bill.
[51:39.640 --> 51:40.640]  Boy, that's not dangerous at all.
[51:40.640 --> 51:46.160]  The president who doesn't know where he is signing a $2 trillion stimulus bill, you'll
[51:46.160 --> 51:48.360]  probably never get your $1,400 paycheck.
[51:48.360 --> 51:50.560]  By the way, Biden said it would be $2,000 for every American.
[51:50.560 --> 51:53.360]  That was a lie.
[51:53.360 --> 51:57.680]  So we'll see if you even get your $1,400, which they say, apparently if you made less
[51:57.680 --> 52:03.680]  than $75,000 in 2019, you qualify for the $1,400 check.
[52:03.680 --> 52:07.200]  But tell me, did they actually run those numbers?
[52:07.200 --> 52:08.840]  No, they didn't.
[52:08.840 --> 52:12.600]  Because how would they know how much money they're going to be paying out?
[52:12.600 --> 52:13.840]  They don't.
[52:13.840 --> 52:15.160]  The whole thing's a farce.
[52:15.160 --> 52:20.160]  You probably will never see that $1,400.
[52:20.160 --> 52:21.600]  But Biden will sign it tomorrow.
[52:21.600 --> 52:31.000]  Oh, by the way, it turns out Bill Gates, his foundations are getting $3.5 billion in the
[52:31.000 --> 52:32.200]  new COVID stimulus bill.
[52:32.200 --> 52:34.360]  How do you like that?
[52:34.360 --> 52:40.840]  Bill Gates, worth hundreds of billions of dollars that we know of, and the largest farmland
[52:40.840 --> 52:50.520]  owner in America, he's going to get $3.5 bill for his causes for the stimulus bill.
[52:50.520 --> 52:57.560]  You won't get a dime, a Democrat pork bill like you couldn't imagine.
[52:57.560 --> 53:03.800]  Meanwhile, there are still more than 20 million Americans getting government jobless benefits.
[53:03.800 --> 53:06.240]  So we're already paying people, folks.
[53:06.240 --> 53:07.920]  You don't need the stimulus bill.
[53:07.920 --> 53:11.480]  People are already getting free money from the government.
[53:11.480 --> 53:14.200]  The stimulus bill isn't even going to do that.
[53:14.200 --> 53:21.320]  It's already happening with more than 20 million people getting free money from the government.
[53:21.320 --> 53:29.480]  Meanwhile, as the Democrats or the Democrat terrorists are occupying Portland, the Democrat
[53:29.480 --> 53:38.280]  terrorists are occupying Minnesota, and you have triple right now on a monthly basis,
[53:38.280 --> 53:45.120]  now triple from the prior year the illegal border crossings under Biden, triple from
[53:45.120 --> 53:46.120]  the prior year.
[53:46.120 --> 53:52.360]  So that means it could be quadruple, maybe even quintuple by June of illegal border crossings.
[53:52.360 --> 53:59.960]  And yet we have walls in D.C., thousands of troops in D.C. protecting them.
[53:59.960 --> 54:06.600]  You are not even allowed to go on D.C. Capitol Hill property or in the buildings, but nothing
[54:06.600 --> 54:11.360]  in response to the terrorists in Minnesota, nothing in response to the terrorists in Portland.
[54:11.360 --> 54:16.000]  They actually get released from jail and charges dropped, and nothing in response to the crisis
[54:16.000 --> 54:20.440]  at the borders, which now Biden, they openly admit they're putting kids in cages.
[54:20.440 --> 54:21.760]  They just don't know what else to do with them.
[54:21.760 --> 54:23.400]  They just call them reception centers.
[54:23.400 --> 54:27.680]  But the kids in cages narrative, Trump shut those facilities down.
[54:27.680 --> 54:32.400]  Biden's team has now reopened them and are putting thousands of kids in cages, many of
[54:32.400 --> 54:34.560]  which have tested positive for COVID.
[54:34.560 --> 54:38.760]  Now if you asked Biden any of this, he would be shocked and appalled because he doesn't
[54:38.760 --> 54:40.280]  know what the hell is going on.
[54:40.280 --> 54:43.000]  He doesn't even know where he is when he wakes up in the morning.
[54:43.000 --> 54:46.720]  Listers ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[54:46.720 --> 54:49.360]  Why do you have multiple high quality iodine?
[54:49.360 --> 54:50.360]  Why do you do that?
[54:50.360 --> 54:52.640]  Because different strokes for different folks.
[54:52.640 --> 54:56.960]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say, hey, a lot of people love deep
[54:56.960 --> 55:01.000]  earth pure crystal iodine, but you should put one out with deeper crystal iodine and
[55:01.000 --> 55:04.720]  the two other types because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[55:04.720 --> 55:05.720]  Boom, we did it.
[55:05.720 --> 55:06.720]  It's popular.
[55:06.720 --> 55:07.720]  It's X3.
[55:07.720 --> 55:08.720]  Is it better than X2?
[55:08.720 --> 55:09.720]  You decide.
[55:09.720 --> 55:10.720]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[55:10.720 --> 55:15.720]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular powdered pill sleeping.
[55:15.720 --> 55:17.120]  And that is down and out.
[55:17.120 --> 55:22.040]  It's super strong, way stronger than knock out, but they don't compete with each other.
[55:22.040 --> 55:26.800]  Different strokes for different folks, different formulas, and it's 40% off out of the gates
[55:26.800 --> 55:29.240]  at m4store.com and free shipping.
[55:29.240 --> 55:32.040]  Sure you're down and out today, and while you're sleeping, you know you're funding
[55:32.040 --> 55:33.520]  the m4 at the same time.
[55:33.520 --> 55:45.000]  Down and out exclusively available at m4store.com or 40% off and for shipping.
[55:45.000 --> 55:49.040]  Throughout history, there have been two basic forms of civilizations and different mixes
[55:49.040 --> 55:50.040]  of the two.
[55:50.040 --> 55:51.040]  One is born of remazons.
[55:51.040 --> 55:53.120]  The other is born of conquest.
[55:53.120 --> 55:58.560]  One bases its power on having a strong, enlightened, focused people with an ethos and a culture,
[55:58.560 --> 56:02.160]  and ingenuity, art, and skill, and strength.
[56:02.160 --> 56:07.400]  The other is based on the massive number of slaves it controls with a tiny elite above
[56:07.400 --> 56:08.400]  it.
[56:08.400 --> 56:13.680]  America is transferring out of a system based on the ethos of liberty and freedom into one
[56:13.680 --> 56:16.160]  of total mass high-tech slavery.
[56:16.160 --> 56:20.200]  That's why the globalists tell us America was founded on slavery when it wasn't.
[56:20.200 --> 56:24.000]  They point out one of our evils so they can invert the facts that they are truly the slave
[56:24.000 --> 56:25.000]  masters.
[56:25.000 --> 56:29.240]  A global permanent lockdown is here, it is already causing millions and millions to starve
[56:29.240 --> 56:30.240]  to death.
[56:30.240 --> 56:32.440]  When they're done, billions will starve to death.
[56:32.440 --> 56:36.080]  Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense in England and a top general have come out
[56:36.080 --> 56:40.320]  and said the coming lockdown is going to trigger a giant new world war.
[56:40.320 --> 56:41.320]  That's the facts.
[56:41.320 --> 56:46.520]  This is the Bill Gates New World Order weapon.
[56:46.520 --> 57:03.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[57:03.960 --> 57:30.480]  You might be familiar with it.
[57:30.480 --> 57:43.000]  We're in the second hour now of the Alex Jones show.
[57:43.000 --> 57:47.680]  Got Alex coming up here momentarily.
[57:47.680 --> 57:52.200]  Pretty amazing here in Texas what's happening.
[57:52.200 --> 57:54.680]  The governor lifts the mask mandate.
[57:54.680 --> 57:58.640]  Of course, I'm not liking what I'm seeing from governor at it.
[57:58.640 --> 58:02.200]  And I believe that in an hour, they're going to be voting on this.
[58:02.200 --> 58:03.200]  We'll have to see.
[58:03.200 --> 58:05.400]  In fact, I didn't even look up on this.
[58:05.400 --> 58:07.880]  Guys, see what you get.
[58:07.880 --> 58:12.480]  Go into a search engine there and plug in Texas HB3.
[58:12.480 --> 58:15.640]  Let's see if there's any news covering this.
[58:15.640 --> 58:22.360]  There hasn't been any news coverage of this, literally zero, zero, zero, zero news coverage
[58:22.360 --> 58:23.360]  of this.
[58:23.360 --> 58:24.360]  Texas HB3.
[58:24.360 --> 58:27.040]  Hey, we're all happy.
[58:27.040 --> 58:29.000]  Governor Abbott says no more mask mandate.
[58:29.000 --> 58:30.840]  Open Texas is 100%.
[58:30.840 --> 58:37.000]  The Attorney General Ken Paxson, who I like, is threatening to sue Steve Adler.
[58:37.000 --> 58:42.680]  Please do sue that guy out of existence, sue that guy out of office, sue Adler for making
[58:42.680 --> 58:48.840]  Austin wear masks and keeping Austin businesses closed.
[58:48.840 --> 58:50.800]  So there you go, though.
[58:50.800 --> 58:51.880]  Finally some news is covering it.
[58:51.880 --> 58:55.440]  Proposal in Texas House would give special committee oversight of governor's pandemic
[58:55.440 --> 58:56.440]  orders.
[58:56.440 --> 59:01.880]  So, and by the way, this is all based on a political group's judgment.
[59:01.880 --> 59:06.840]  They don't declare, oh, what is actually considered a pandemic or when do we consider
[59:06.840 --> 59:08.720]  ourselves to be in a pandemic?
[59:08.720 --> 59:11.600]  Because if they did the numbers, then it wouldn't work out.
[59:11.600 --> 59:15.320]  And if you did the numbers on COVID, you would never have been in a pandemic.
[59:15.320 --> 59:20.240]  So let's say you declare, I mean, let's be conservative here.
[59:20.240 --> 59:31.240]  Let's say that if in a two-month stretch, you had the death toll increase by more than
[59:31.240 --> 59:37.040]  1% consistently for a two-month or even one month, whatever.
[59:37.040 --> 59:40.240]  Just to say, all right, what are the parameters of what we consider a deadly pandemic?
[59:40.240 --> 59:43.720]  All right, the death toll just went up 1% in a month.
[59:43.720 --> 59:45.960]  We're in a pandemic or 2% or whatever it is.
[59:45.960 --> 59:47.720]  Well, they don't even have that.
[59:47.720 --> 59:54.520]  This is all judgment on political groups, oversight committees that just will just declare
[59:54.520 --> 59:57.280]  on their judgment, oh, we're in a pandemic now.
[59:57.280 --> 59:58.480]  So there's no measurement.
[59:58.480 --> 59:59.480]  There's no vote.
[59:59.480 --> 1:00:00.480]  They just decide.
[1:00:00.480 --> 1:00:04.480]  And then once they decide, it's all in here.
[1:00:04.480 --> 1:00:09.360]  They can make you wear a mask, take a vaccine, stay inside, all of it.
[1:00:09.360 --> 1:00:10.360]  All of it.
[1:00:10.360 --> 1:00:11.360]  Total tyranny.
[1:00:11.360 --> 1:00:14.720]  HB3, pandemic emergency provisions.
[1:00:14.720 --> 1:00:17.600]  And they just decide when there's a pandemic.
[1:00:17.600 --> 1:00:18.640]  There's no science.
[1:00:18.640 --> 1:00:20.240]  There's no statistics or data.
[1:00:20.240 --> 1:00:23.760]  It's just their judgment, like Fauci said yesterday on TV.
[1:00:23.760 --> 1:00:27.320]  Well, we don't really have the science or the data on the vaccine, so we're just making
[1:00:27.320 --> 1:00:31.240]  a judgment call.
[1:00:31.240 --> 1:00:33.200]  It's sick.
[1:00:33.200 --> 1:00:38.680]  And now Abbott, excuse me, yeah, Abbott, I mean, what the hell, man?
[1:00:38.680 --> 1:00:41.760]  He comes out and makes a statement.
[1:00:41.760 --> 1:00:46.040]  First of all, he says he's going to, so Abbott says he's going to attack free speech censorship
[1:00:46.040 --> 1:00:47.760]  and make it illegal in Texas.
[1:00:47.760 --> 1:00:49.600]  Meanwhile, we have Facebook headquartered here.
[1:00:49.600 --> 1:00:51.160]  We have Google headquartered here.
[1:00:51.160 --> 1:00:52.840]  We're bringing in Amazon.
[1:00:52.840 --> 1:00:57.920]  So we have three of the main people that censor people, Facebook, Google and Amazon.
[1:00:57.920 --> 1:00:59.840]  They're all headquartered in Texas.
[1:00:59.840 --> 1:01:01.040]  Abbott doesn't have a problem with that.
[1:01:01.040 --> 1:01:03.680]  I'm not even complaining about that.
[1:01:03.680 --> 1:01:07.320]  But he says, oh, he's going to stop internet censorship and he's going to make it illegal
[1:01:07.320 --> 1:01:09.480]  in Texas.
[1:01:09.480 --> 1:01:10.480]  All posturing.
[1:01:10.480 --> 1:01:11.480]  He'll do nothing.
[1:01:11.480 --> 1:01:13.440]  He'll never take that stand.
[1:01:13.440 --> 1:01:22.360]  And now, yesterday, Abbott comes out and says that he's banning Gab.
[1:01:22.360 --> 1:01:25.360]  And he says it's an anti-Semitic platform, a lie.
[1:01:25.360 --> 1:01:29.800]  So Abbott, you might as well be a Democrat with a big lie like this and the fraud.
[1:01:29.800 --> 1:01:31.040]  Hey, I'm Greg Abbott.
[1:01:31.040 --> 1:01:33.160]  I'm going to stop censorship in Texas.
[1:01:33.160 --> 1:01:35.960]  By the way, did I mention I'm censoring Gab?
[1:01:35.960 --> 1:01:36.960]  You fraud.
[1:01:36.960 --> 1:01:37.960]  You phony.
[1:01:37.960 --> 1:01:38.960]  Oh, I'm Governor Abbott.
[1:01:38.960 --> 1:01:41.800]  I'm going to allow you to breathe air again and take off the mask.
[1:01:41.800 --> 1:01:48.040]  Well, then why don't you stop a political group from getting HB3 pass, which will make
[1:01:48.040 --> 1:01:51.800]  us slaves when they decide there's a pandemic?
[1:01:51.800 --> 1:01:55.840]  The general public has finally figured out why I'm upset.
[1:01:55.840 --> 1:01:58.800]  They figured out that the globalists are literally trying to kill us.
[1:01:58.800 --> 1:02:01.520]  They're trying to take over civilization and society.
[1:02:01.520 --> 1:02:04.520]  And they depend on the public being ignorant.
[1:02:04.520 --> 1:02:08.400]  That's what Jesus said, my people perish for lack of knowledge.
[1:02:08.400 --> 1:02:09.680]  Knowledge is power.
[1:02:09.680 --> 1:02:15.440]  Like our bodies are made up of all these tissues and all these systems that die without essential
[1:02:15.440 --> 1:02:17.280]  vitamins and minerals.
[1:02:17.280 --> 1:02:20.520]  And that's why they don't want you to know about essential vitamins and minerals because
[1:02:20.520 --> 1:02:23.520]  it's so simple because you won't be under their control anymore.
[1:02:23.520 --> 1:02:28.000]  Well, the vitamin mineral fusion, the highest quality vitamin mineral fusion system out
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:32.000]  there in a liquid vitamin form is now back in stock at infoworkstore.com.
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:34.680]  And it's not just an incredible formula at a great price.
[1:02:34.680 --> 1:02:37.800]  It funds the info war at the same time.
[1:02:37.800 --> 1:02:40.200]  And no other product you can buy does that.
[1:02:40.200 --> 1:02:45.160]  So again, infowarstore.com, it's back in stock, 50% off vitamin mineral fusion.
[1:02:45.160 --> 1:02:47.680]  I'm going to keep it at that until it sells out.
[1:02:47.680 --> 1:03:17.240]  So take action today and give it to your friends and family as a gift.
[1:03:17.240 --> 1:03:20.840]  And I'll be back in Austin very, very soon.
[1:03:20.840 --> 1:03:21.840]  I'll just leave it at that.
[1:03:21.840 --> 1:03:25.200]  We're getting a lot of important work done while we're here in Florida.
[1:03:25.200 --> 1:03:26.800]  Spring break is coming in today.
[1:03:26.800 --> 1:03:31.400]  So the roads are backed up, but most people are not wearing masks or see if they're all
[1:03:31.400 --> 1:03:32.400]  the propaganda.
[1:03:32.400 --> 1:03:35.520]  Here's the big announcement.
[1:03:35.520 --> 1:03:37.000]  The big announcement is this.
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:40.600]  Everything we talked about a year ago with this pandemic, this pandemic has turned out
[1:03:40.600 --> 1:03:44.880]  to be absolutely on except overkill.
[1:03:44.880 --> 1:03:49.640]  Even worse than we thought they would actually push.
[1:03:49.640 --> 1:03:55.040]  I've read a book about the tactics that the enemy engages in and I've read a lot of wide
[1:03:55.040 --> 1:04:02.480]  spectrum of propaganda books and a lot of political and real politic doctrines.
[1:04:02.480 --> 1:04:06.640]  And I've of course read Machiavelli and I'm just here to tell you, nobody's codified the
[1:04:06.640 --> 1:04:13.320]  systems they're using in the textbooks of tyranny because this is a modern fusion of
[1:04:13.320 --> 1:04:20.080]  a bunch of different forms of oppression, it's extremely organized and extremely drawn
[1:04:20.080 --> 1:04:21.080]  out.
[1:04:21.080 --> 1:04:25.160]  And when I say drawn out, I mean, it's been battle planned all of it.
[1:04:25.160 --> 1:04:28.280]  And so here's the big news.
[1:04:28.280 --> 1:04:33.880]  They're never going to get away with this synthetic virus and the vaccines that are designed
[1:04:33.880 --> 1:04:37.640]  to test how many people they can kill and get away with it.
[1:04:37.640 --> 1:04:38.640]  And so that's the big news.
[1:04:38.640 --> 1:04:44.600]  This is all a big test and looking at how we've basically gone along so far with the
[1:04:44.600 --> 1:04:51.200]  test, I'd give us about a C minus with the globals.
[1:04:51.200 --> 1:04:54.560]  If we got an A plus, they would probably go ahead in the next six months and release
[1:04:54.560 --> 1:04:56.360]  a real bio weapon that would kill billions.
[1:04:56.360 --> 1:04:58.160]  So that's the real end game.
[1:04:58.160 --> 1:05:00.520]  Right now, we've got about a C minus.
[1:05:00.520 --> 1:05:01.520]  They're not sure.
[1:05:01.520 --> 1:05:08.000]  They're having some internal battles, a lot of their own companies have pulled back and
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:12.240]  we're seeing massive pullback by major governments and we're seeing massive pushback by good
[1:05:12.240 --> 1:05:13.840]  people in the medical system.
[1:05:13.840 --> 1:05:16.040]  But this is life and death.
[1:05:16.040 --> 1:05:18.680]  People now know when you two are on the show, I don't tell you these things just to get
[1:05:18.680 --> 1:05:20.280]  ratings and be shocking.
[1:05:20.280 --> 1:05:25.080]  This is a serious heart attack and you and your whole family are in extreme danger of
[1:05:25.080 --> 1:05:27.520]  being murdered, extreme danger.
[1:05:27.520 --> 1:05:31.320]  And it's not just from the virus they're going to release.
[1:05:31.320 --> 1:05:34.880]  It's from the collapse of civilization that's going to ensue that they're then going to
[1:05:34.880 --> 1:05:38.080]  organize to consolidate power.
[1:05:38.080 --> 1:05:39.080]  And so here's the lesson.
[1:05:39.080 --> 1:05:41.080]  So there's thousands of data points here, so I'm just going to give you some of the
[1:05:41.080 --> 1:05:42.080]  key ones.
[1:05:42.080 --> 1:05:45.640]  This is also people that think they're part of the establishment and know you're going
[1:05:45.640 --> 1:05:49.920]  along with this and think this is just a financial consolidation and a power grab and to bring
[1:05:49.920 --> 1:05:54.640]  in a world ID and do a drill for a bio release so we can save people in the future if there's
[1:05:54.640 --> 1:05:55.640]  a real one.
[1:05:55.640 --> 1:05:58.880]  I mean, in mainline literature from the UN, they admit this is all a drill and they're
[1:05:58.880 --> 1:06:02.600]  doing this as a world health drill to see if governments get in line to have global
[1:06:02.600 --> 1:06:06.480]  governance and good family planning robot and yes, we need to reduce population.
[1:06:06.480 --> 1:06:09.760]  Yes, there's some steroids in the vaccines, you know, there's 20 people.
[1:06:09.760 --> 1:06:12.920]  That's the cover story for the managerial class.
[1:06:12.920 --> 1:06:21.560]  The real story here is the betrayal of that managerial class and everybody else, okay?
[1:06:21.560 --> 1:06:27.880]  So if we fail this test and we're right on the edge of it, submitting gets our grade
[1:06:27.880 --> 1:06:31.000]  up and the way you fail the test is getting an A plus.
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:40.720]  A plus is death, you want to fail the test, you want to get a zero, but that would mean
[1:06:40.720 --> 1:06:44.960]  waking up to the whole system, rejecting the whole system, but the only way they're going
[1:06:44.960 --> 1:06:49.080]  to get away with the mass death they've already created and the huge paper trail of how they
[1:06:49.080 --> 1:06:57.760]  did it in Wuhan and Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab is to release the next phase even though
[1:06:57.760 --> 1:07:06.280]  we are close to failing the test because they come into kind of a paradox here where if
[1:07:06.280 --> 1:07:10.040]  they go ahead with the attack, too many people know and they're going to get big problems,
[1:07:10.040 --> 1:07:12.920]  but if they don't go ahead with the attack, they're going to end up going to prison for
[1:07:12.920 --> 1:07:14.400]  what they've already done.
[1:07:14.400 --> 1:07:19.280]  So I just told you you want to fail the test, but you've got to completely fail, that's
[1:07:19.280 --> 1:07:20.280]  what I'm saying.
[1:07:20.280 --> 1:07:25.080]  You've got to absolutely wake up to these criminals, absolutely reject them and then
[1:07:25.080 --> 1:07:31.960]  the establishment has to go ahead and send up some signals to the public and the world
[1:07:31.960 --> 1:07:37.400]  that they're not going to be part of this because you have this medical eugenics cartel
[1:07:37.400 --> 1:07:41.960]  at the heart of this whole thing that is basically manipulating all the other elite sectors of
[1:07:41.960 --> 1:07:46.840]  the planet towards destruction and again towards the collapse of the nation state and all will
[1:07:46.840 --> 1:07:51.280]  be left to city states that then control all the other feudal sectors of the planet.
[1:07:51.280 --> 1:07:56.720]  And this is the club of Rome's lovelest plan being carried out now under the auspices of
[1:07:56.720 --> 1:07:57.720]  the great reset.
[1:07:57.720 --> 1:08:01.600]  So that's really the big overview.
[1:08:01.600 --> 1:08:06.320]  Here's some of the latest news at m4wars.com, dozens and dozens of articles I've seen since
[1:08:06.320 --> 1:08:11.680]  last night of this major medical group and this prestigious scientist and this particular
[1:08:11.680 --> 1:08:16.040]  scientist that heads up a whole virology department and I mean just cream of the cream, crème
[1:08:16.040 --> 1:08:23.400]  dollar, crème saying they know of whole nursing homes where almost everybody gets super sick
[1:08:23.400 --> 1:08:29.200]  and a bunch of people die, that they know of convents where three, four nuns out of 50
[1:08:29.200 --> 1:08:30.200]  died.
[1:08:30.200 --> 1:08:35.760]  I mean we're talking massive death ricks here and they're dying after the vaccine, the mRNA,
[1:08:35.760 --> 1:08:39.800]  the Pfizer and the Moderna are the worst but the Johnson's and Johnson's are super bad
[1:08:39.800 --> 1:08:45.360]  as well and so is the AstraZeneca and that's why again India and Switzerland and South
[1:08:45.360 --> 1:08:50.640]  Africa and Australia and all these other countries now it's like 20 countries or more have pulled
[1:08:50.640 --> 1:08:54.680]  out of it saying it doesn't help you, you still get COVID later and it's causing all
[1:08:54.680 --> 1:08:57.560]  sorts of problems like we knew it would do.
[1:08:57.560 --> 1:09:01.200]  So again you got to ask yourself why would they want something that's deadly and again
[1:09:01.200 --> 1:09:04.640]  it's a test to see how you're going to respond and remember the beta test is always much
[1:09:04.640 --> 1:09:06.840]  smaller than the real attack.
[1:09:06.840 --> 1:09:13.600]  So that's it, there's not much more time to turn this around, if they think they can
[1:09:13.600 --> 1:09:16.480]  launch an organized bio attack and you're going to stay in your house, do as you're
[1:09:16.480 --> 1:09:20.480]  told, only keep their companies open to vertically integrate the economy, fully bankrupt small
[1:09:20.480 --> 1:09:24.640]  businesses so the globalists can dictate the terms of the planet's surrender, they
[1:09:24.640 --> 1:09:29.200]  will go ahead with the next attack, if you don't submit they will back off, so this
[1:09:29.200 --> 1:09:35.080]  is truly if you're weak and submit you're dead and I mean I'll predict in five years
[1:09:35.080 --> 1:09:40.720]  half the people watching this are going to be dead if they go forward with this, okay?
[1:09:40.720 --> 1:09:46.320]  So it's deadly serious, it's a heart attack and all the smart thinking people out there
[1:09:46.320 --> 1:09:50.080]  that know this, that have done this their whole lives agree with my analysis, I mean
[1:09:50.080 --> 1:09:55.000]  just yesterday I met with the former head of a major US intelligence agency, well actually
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:59.160]  he's run two big departments and he totally agrees with my analysis, he's just one of
[1:09:59.160 --> 1:10:04.120]  the best analyses out there and it's a real analysis and also knows about all my predictions
[1:10:04.120 --> 1:10:05.120]  about this.
[1:10:05.120 --> 1:10:08.280]  We don't have time to pat each other on the back anymore and he wasn't patting me on
[1:10:08.280 --> 1:10:12.360]  the back, we're just talking about how serious the situation is and he thinks we've got
[1:10:12.360 --> 1:10:15.880]  about a year until they go into the next phase and I agree with him, so I'm just going to
[1:10:15.880 --> 1:10:20.800]  tell you again ladies and gentlemen this is deadly serious for you and your family, there's
[1:10:20.800 --> 1:10:23.600]  a reason they don't want you to go to infowars.com, there's a reason they don't want you to share
[1:10:23.600 --> 1:10:27.640]  my film in game, there's a reason they don't, because it's the truth and we can beat them
[1:10:27.640 --> 1:10:29.800]  if people discover this information.
[1:10:29.800 --> 1:10:36.640]  So I'm sure as we take it over in the next segment I was on a great international program
[1:10:36.640 --> 1:10:39.640]  a few days ago and I'll tell you about that coming up in the third hour, we're going to
[1:10:39.640 --> 1:10:44.440]  hear some large excerpts of that interview that people really liked coming up with a
[1:10:44.440 --> 1:10:48.640]  former CBC national broadcaster who broke away from that so you can tell the truth,
[1:10:48.640 --> 1:10:52.520]  it was a big international program, had a lot of big guests, dealt big tree and David
[1:10:52.520 --> 1:10:56.400]  Ike and others on it and so that's coming up later in the transmission.
[1:10:56.400 --> 1:11:01.160]  Please remember we can't do this without money and so I've never really spent my time going
[1:11:01.160 --> 1:11:07.640]  around trying to get money but I have to do it because we have to sell products, we have
[1:11:07.640 --> 1:11:11.360]  to really expand in the face of this or just roll over to die.
[1:11:11.360 --> 1:11:15.680]  Other people aren't going to do it, infowars has to do it and I've got all these organizations
[1:11:15.680 --> 1:11:19.320]  and all these prominent groups that actually need our help and need our expertise and I'll
[1:11:19.320 --> 1:11:22.720]  be quite frank with you, I don't want to be the big leader in this, not even because I'm
[1:11:22.720 --> 1:11:27.960]  scared they're going to kill me even though that ups the chances of that, it's a big responsibility,
[1:11:27.960 --> 1:11:33.920]  it's frustrating and I want to do a good job but it also goes to all of you, I know you
[1:11:33.920 --> 1:11:37.600]  don't want this to be real, I know you don't want to have to be engaged in all this but
[1:11:37.600 --> 1:11:41.440]  you are, you're here because you care so again thank you for your support, spread the word

[1:12:03.880 --> 1:12:08.160]  Alright so we'll be hearing again from Alex coming up on the broadcast but you just heard
[1:12:08.160 --> 1:12:15.200]  it and you know, remember, remember folks because it doesn't get talked about nearly
[1:12:15.200 --> 1:12:18.640]  enough, in fact it doesn't get talked about at all, in fact I don't know anyone else that
[1:12:18.640 --> 1:12:24.160]  talks about it besides me, it's not that the democrats and the liberals are going to come
[1:12:24.160 --> 1:12:29.200]  and put us in gulag, folks they already are, okay, just remember, every day there's dozens
[1:12:29.200 --> 1:12:33.400]  if not hundreds of Trump supporters sitting in a jail cell rotting right now and the judge
[1:12:33.400 --> 1:12:37.880]  says you can't get out until your court date and they're delaying court dates for years
[1:12:37.880 --> 1:12:42.240]  because of the fake pandemic, so they've already rounded up their political distance, there's
[1:12:42.240 --> 1:12:46.840]  already dozens if not hundreds of Trump supporters, innocent people rotting in a jail cell right
[1:12:46.840 --> 1:12:49.880]  now, political prisoners, so don't forget about that.
[1:12:49.880 --> 1:12:54.800]  I actually bought this, it blocks the U.H.F. frequency, Snowden and others taught us how

[1:14:53.880 --> 1:15:11.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:15:11.400 --> 1:15:27.900]  The
[1:15:27.900 --> 1:15:31.900]  His peak number is 1,049, that was his record high.
[1:15:31.900 --> 1:15:34.900]  But the bald eagle right now, what's the bald eagle at?
[1:15:34.900 --> 1:15:36.900]  4,100, so that's down from earlier.
[1:15:36.900 --> 1:15:37.900]  Is it 4,300?
[1:15:37.900 --> 1:15:44.900]  Anyway, the bald eagle four times as popular as Joe Biden on the webcam when it's just nesting.
[1:15:44.900 --> 1:15:45.900]  So that's nice.
[1:15:45.900 --> 1:15:49.900]  I'm talking to some of the crew here during the break, and I was going to cover this later
[1:15:49.900 --> 1:15:55.900]  on the War Room because sometimes I do a little more sports stuff there, the political side of it.
[1:15:55.900 --> 1:15:58.900]  But here on The Jones Show, I was going to just pass on that, but I'll cover it later.
[1:15:58.900 --> 1:16:01.900]  But the crew prints this to me, and it's funny, I'm talking during the break.
[1:16:01.900 --> 1:16:06.900]  So the Texas Rangers, let me give you a little bit of a backstory here.
[1:16:06.900 --> 1:16:15.900]  The MLB team, Texas Rangers, they just opened a new stadium.
[1:16:15.900 --> 1:16:21.900]  And I guess the Rangers haven't played in it, but I guess they were using it last year.
[1:16:21.900 --> 1:16:23.900]  Basically, they were using it last year.
[1:16:23.900 --> 1:16:27.900]  It was open, it was built, but it wasn't open because you couldn't go to games last year.
[1:16:27.900 --> 1:16:31.900]  But they were using it last year for some of the games, and I think the playoff games,
[1:16:31.900 --> 1:16:36.900]  because Texas likes freedom, don't remind some of the crew about that.
[1:16:36.900 --> 1:16:39.900]  They may cry when the Cardinals beat the Rangers.
[1:16:39.900 --> 1:16:40.900]  Don't play this.
[1:16:40.900 --> 1:16:43.900]  There may be a tear in that studio and on the air.
[1:16:43.900 --> 1:16:47.900]  But anyway, with my friend David Fries, by the way, from St. Louis.
[1:16:47.900 --> 1:16:50.900]  Anyway, getting back to the story.
[1:16:50.900 --> 1:16:58.900]  So the Texas Rangers, though, have said they will open up at 100% capacity for opening day.
[1:16:58.900 --> 1:17:02.900]  And so I'm reading the story, and I'm trying to figure out exactly what this means,
[1:17:02.900 --> 1:17:06.900]  because I'm a little confused, because apparently there's some final games
[1:17:06.900 --> 1:17:09.900]  that they're going to be playing their exhibition games at their stadium.
[1:17:09.900 --> 1:17:12.900]  Normally you do that at your spring training facilities.
[1:17:12.900 --> 1:17:17.900]  But I'm a little confused, because I guess they're going to do their last spring training games
[1:17:17.900 --> 1:17:20.900]  at the stadium for full capacity.
[1:17:20.900 --> 1:17:23.900]  And then for opening day, they're going to do full capacity.
[1:17:23.900 --> 1:17:28.900]  Now, again, if you're familiar with me, you know, I came out of sports media
[1:17:28.900 --> 1:17:32.900]  before I joined InfoWars, and as a kid growing up, for whatever reason,
[1:17:32.900 --> 1:17:35.900]  I just love the Americana, all of American Skylines.
[1:17:35.900 --> 1:17:37.900]  I always love baseball stadiums.
[1:17:37.900 --> 1:17:39.900]  I used to go on road trips with my dad.
[1:17:39.900 --> 1:17:40.900]  We'd go to baseball stadiums.
[1:17:40.900 --> 1:17:42.900]  So I love baseball stadiums.
[1:17:42.900 --> 1:17:43.900]  I love sports.
[1:17:43.900 --> 1:17:45.900]  I love the crowd.
[1:17:45.900 --> 1:17:47.900]  I love a cold beer.
[1:17:47.900 --> 1:17:48.900]  It's fun.
[1:17:48.900 --> 1:17:49.900]  I like peanuts and cracker jacks.
[1:17:49.900 --> 1:17:50.900]  Like, it's fun.
[1:17:50.900 --> 1:17:51.900]  It's America.
[1:17:51.900 --> 1:17:53.900]  We don't get to experience that anymore in their Communist Democrat Party rule.
[1:17:53.900 --> 1:17:59.900]  But so they're saying, though, it's going to be full capacity for opening day.
[1:17:59.900 --> 1:18:05.900]  But then after opening day, they're going to go to distanced capacity.
[1:18:05.900 --> 1:18:09.900]  And I was saying this to the crew, and they're like, man, this is just, I hate this.
[1:18:09.900 --> 1:18:13.900]  And it is ridiculous.
[1:18:13.900 --> 1:18:17.900]  And so apparently they had, I guess, a couple of thousand people that were allowed to attend
[1:18:17.900 --> 1:18:20.900]  inside Globe Live Park, which is a brand new stadium.
[1:18:20.900 --> 1:18:21.900]  Very nice.
[1:18:21.900 --> 1:18:24.900]  You want to talk about spoiled.
[1:18:24.900 --> 1:18:28.900]  The Texas Rangers already had one of the nicest stadiums in baseball, in my opinion.
[1:18:28.900 --> 1:18:30.900]  I love their old stadium, but they won't be using it anymore.
[1:18:30.900 --> 1:18:33.900]  They got a brand new stadium, which is also very, very nice.
[1:18:33.900 --> 1:18:35.900]  I was in it over the winter.
[1:18:35.900 --> 1:18:37.900]  A very, very nice facility that they have there.
[1:18:37.900 --> 1:18:38.900]  They should be proud of that.
[1:18:38.900 --> 1:18:39.900]  I love their old facility, too.
[1:18:39.900 --> 1:18:45.900]  You may remember I attended a Rangers game set front row behind home plate with Rob Dew in the Trump mask.
[1:18:45.900 --> 1:18:49.900]  And we inspired a home run from Joey Gallo.
[1:18:49.900 --> 1:18:50.900]  Do you guys remember that?
[1:18:50.900 --> 1:18:53.900]  See if you can pull up that archival footage.
[1:18:53.900 --> 1:18:57.900]  But it's total nonsense.
[1:18:57.900 --> 1:19:02.900]  And I guess they don't know what full capacity is yet, because technically they haven't had a full capacity crowd.
[1:19:02.900 --> 1:19:05.900]  So they're estimating 40,000 people.
[1:19:05.900 --> 1:19:10.900]  That's amongst the smaller stadiums for attendance.
[1:19:10.900 --> 1:19:11.900]  But we'll see.
[1:19:11.900 --> 1:19:13.900]  It'll probably end up being more than that.
[1:19:13.900 --> 1:19:15.900]  But why?
[1:19:15.900 --> 1:19:17.900]  It just shows the insanity.
[1:19:17.900 --> 1:19:27.900]  Why would you open up for full capacity for spring training finale exhibition games and then opening day, but then not the rest of the season?
[1:19:27.900 --> 1:19:32.900]  That makes absolutely zero sense to any thinking rational person.
[1:19:32.900 --> 1:19:35.900]  It is a retractable roof. Will the roof be on or off?
[1:19:35.900 --> 1:19:36.900]  I'm not sure.
[1:19:36.900 --> 1:19:41.900]  They don't mention anything about the masks in here other than that the state has lifted the mask mandate.
[1:19:41.900 --> 1:19:46.900]  Now, when I was there in the winter, there were people wearing masks, but it was like a 50-50 split.
[1:19:46.900 --> 1:19:48.900]  And there were a bunch of people in there.
[1:19:48.900 --> 1:19:54.900]  I mean, there were thousands of people during this big winter Christmas thing that they had there up in DFW.
[1:19:54.900 --> 1:19:56.900]  And I did not wear a mask.
[1:19:56.900 --> 1:19:57.900]  Nobody said anything to me.
[1:19:57.900 --> 1:19:58.900]  I was in the stadium without a mask.
[1:19:58.900 --> 1:20:00.900]  Nobody said anything to me.
[1:20:00.900 --> 1:20:02.900]  I was not the only one not wearing a mask.
[1:20:02.900 --> 1:20:06.900]  So I don't think they'll be enforcing the mask at this game.
[1:20:06.900 --> 1:20:10.900]  I don't even think they were enforcing the mask at the MLE playoff games that were played there.
[1:20:10.900 --> 1:20:11.900]  I don't know. I didn't watch them.
[1:20:11.900 --> 1:20:15.900]  So I'm not up on that information.
[1:20:15.900 --> 1:20:17.900]  But doesn't it just show you the insanity?
[1:20:17.900 --> 1:20:23.900]  And they say, well, we want to be able for the Rangers fans to be able to see opening day.
[1:20:23.900 --> 1:20:25.900]  But after that, we don't care.
[1:20:25.900 --> 1:20:27.900]  What?
[1:20:27.900 --> 1:20:31.900]  And anybody knows opening day is a big ticket for baseball.
[1:20:31.900 --> 1:20:35.900]  It's probably two, three times the normal ticket price.
[1:20:35.900 --> 1:20:37.900]  So some people can't afford to go to opening day.
[1:20:37.900 --> 1:20:39.900]  So they wait till the second game, the third game.
[1:20:39.900 --> 1:20:41.900]  Well, it won't be the same experience for them now.
[1:20:41.900 --> 1:20:43.900]  Oh, here we go.
[1:20:43.900 --> 1:20:45.900]  OK, the crew has the intel.
[1:20:45.900 --> 1:20:48.900]  The masks will be required for all fans.
[1:20:48.900 --> 1:20:51.900]  This is hilarious, dude.
[1:20:51.900 --> 1:20:55.900]  Except when they're eating or drinking at their seats.
[1:20:55.900 --> 1:20:58.900]  That includes all concourse areas when entering globe live field.
[1:20:58.900 --> 1:21:02.900]  You know, I was thinking about trying to go just to be a part of this.
[1:21:02.900 --> 1:21:06.900]  And just to have that fun experience of being a free American again.
[1:21:06.900 --> 1:21:07.900]  It's so rare.
[1:21:07.900 --> 1:21:09.900]  We haven't had it in years.
[1:21:09.900 --> 1:21:14.900]  But boy, if they're going to be doing that, I think I'm out.
[1:21:14.900 --> 1:21:24.900]  I think I'm not going to be wearing a mask to get into an open stadium because that's retarded.
[1:21:24.900 --> 1:21:28.900]  Hey, we're going to open up the stadium for exhibition games and opening day full capacity.
[1:21:28.900 --> 1:21:30.900]  But after that, only 11,000.
[1:21:30.900 --> 1:21:34.900]  That's idiotic.
[1:21:34.900 --> 1:21:35.900]  Don't worry.
[1:21:35.900 --> 1:21:38.900]  There's going to be plenty of hands-initizer to go around.
[1:21:38.900 --> 1:21:41.900]  Disgusting.
[1:21:41.900 --> 1:21:45.900]  What a joke.
[1:21:45.900 --> 1:21:47.900]  What a pathetic joke.
[1:21:47.900 --> 1:21:50.900]  Meanwhile, the NFL has to be pissed.
[1:21:50.900 --> 1:21:58.900]  If you're Stan Cronkey, the owner of the Los Angeles Rams, you moved your franchise to Los Angeles.
[1:21:58.900 --> 1:22:01.900]  You spent billions of dollars on a stadium.
[1:22:01.900 --> 1:22:04.900]  And he had to finance a lot of that on his own.
[1:22:04.900 --> 1:22:05.900]  That's why he left St. Louis.
[1:22:05.900 --> 1:22:07.900]  He couldn't get the financing he wanted, but he didn't care.
[1:22:07.900 --> 1:22:12.900]  He figured I'd rather pay for a stadium in LA than pay for a stadium in St. Louis.
[1:22:12.900 --> 1:22:17.900]  So he moves the team and builds a stadium in Los Angeles for two franchises, by the way.
[1:22:17.900 --> 1:22:19.900]  It's supposed to be the Charters and the Rams.
[1:22:19.900 --> 1:22:22.900]  And they can't even open the stadium for business.
[1:22:22.900 --> 1:22:30.900]  So you've got this like 100,000 seat, probably the most state-of-the-art facility in the world in Los Angeles.
[1:22:30.900 --> 1:22:34.900]  And you can't even put an ass in a seat because it's in California.
[1:22:34.900 --> 1:22:40.900]  But they're about to open up the Rangers games to 100% capacity for at least a game or two.
[1:22:40.900 --> 1:22:46.900]  You have to be ripping your hair, whatever you have left out of your head,
[1:22:46.900 --> 1:22:50.900]  if you're staying conky in Los Angeles right now.
[1:22:50.900 --> 1:22:52.900]  Wow.
[1:22:52.900 --> 1:22:54.900]  This is just such a joke.
[1:22:54.900 --> 1:22:55.900]  I mean, winner, winner.
[1:22:55.900 --> 1:22:57.900]  Seriously, general question.
[1:22:57.900 --> 1:23:00.900]  I wish the media would ask this.
[1:23:00.900 --> 1:23:02.900]  But the media loves being slaves, I guess.
[1:23:02.900 --> 1:23:05.900]  Or they won't let real media in to ask Democrats these questions.
[1:23:05.900 --> 1:23:07.900]  Or they get banned on the Internet.
[1:23:07.900 --> 1:23:09.900]  When are we allowed to be free again?
[1:23:09.900 --> 1:23:10.900]  Just curious.
[1:23:10.900 --> 1:23:12.900]  I mean, we're not really discussing it.
[1:23:12.900 --> 1:23:15.900]  So I'm just curious, when is America allowed to be free again?
[1:23:15.900 --> 1:23:16.900]  Whatever.
[1:23:16.900 --> 1:23:17.900]  Are we done?
[1:23:17.900 --> 1:23:18.900]  Is freedom done?
[1:23:18.900 --> 1:23:19.900]  Is it over?
[1:23:19.900 --> 1:23:20.900]  I mean, are they going to announce it?
[1:23:20.900 --> 1:23:21.900]  Are they going to let us know?
[1:23:21.900 --> 1:23:24.900]  Are they just going to keep teasing us?
[1:23:24.900 --> 1:23:26.900]  Should we just declare America dead?
[1:23:26.900 --> 1:23:28.900]  I mean, seriously, should we declare freedom dead?
[1:23:28.900 --> 1:23:29.900]  Should we declare America dead?
[1:23:29.900 --> 1:23:30.900]  Is this it?
[1:23:30.900 --> 1:23:31.900]  The pandemic forever?
[1:23:31.900 --> 1:23:32.900]  Masked forever?
[1:23:32.900 --> 1:23:33.900]  Social distancing?
[1:23:33.900 --> 1:23:35.900]  All the other nonsense forever?
[1:23:35.900 --> 1:23:36.900]  Is this it?
[1:23:36.900 --> 1:23:37.900]  I mean, is America dead?
[1:23:37.900 --> 1:23:38.900]  Seriously, let's ask Biden.
[1:23:38.900 --> 1:23:39.900]  Let's ask Harris.
[1:23:39.900 --> 1:23:40.900]  Let's ask Pelosi.
[1:23:40.900 --> 1:23:41.900]  Let's ask Adler.
[1:23:41.900 --> 1:23:42.900]  Let's ask Fauci.
[1:23:42.900 --> 1:23:43.900]  Let's ask Gates.
[1:23:43.900 --> 1:23:45.900]  Is America dead?
[1:23:45.900 --> 1:23:46.900]  Is freedom dead?
[1:23:46.900 --> 1:23:47.900]  Just be honest with us.
[1:23:47.900 --> 1:23:48.900]  If it's dead, just tell us.
[1:23:48.900 --> 1:23:49.900]  We'd like to know.
[1:23:49.900 --> 1:23:53.900]  The Pope came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate alliance to redistribute
[1:23:53.900 --> 1:23:58.900]  wealth and create a planetary universal income, which of course the United Nations and global
[1:23:58.900 --> 1:24:02.900]  corporations will control through the apps on your phone and finally a chip under your
[1:24:02.900 --> 1:24:03.900]  skin.
[1:24:03.900 --> 1:24:04.900]  It's all now completely official.
[1:24:04.900 --> 1:24:11.340]  Part of the UN Great Reset of the Davos Group and Klaus Schwab, all officially written about
[1:24:11.340 --> 1:24:16.340]  in hundreds of books by Schwab and Rockefeller Foundation, all the rest of them, Agenda 21,
[1:24:16.340 --> 1:24:21.100]  Agenda 2030, it's here and only gets worse like being fed into a wood chipper or a meat
[1:24:21.100 --> 1:24:27.980]  grinder until you reject it all and the rejection starts with realizing it's a spiritual battle
[1:24:27.980 --> 1:24:31.260]  to burst evil and stopping abortion.
[1:24:31.260 --> 1:24:33.420]  We must start valuing human life again.
[1:24:33.420 --> 1:24:40.500]  We must start saying that we are not expendable, that we are not disposable, that we are essential.
[1:24:40.500 --> 1:24:43.100]  Until we do that, we are all slaves.
[1:24:43.100 --> 1:24:50.860]  We must stand up and declare our basic God-given human rights now.
[1:24:50.860 --> 1:24:53.940]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[1:24:53.940 --> 1:24:57.820]  The population has been trained to submit to what you're told and it's all going to
[1:24:57.820 --> 1:24:58.820]  pass.
[1:24:58.820 --> 1:25:02.340]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach
[1:25:02.340 --> 1:25:06.540]  a point where all the training is just beta and you go into the point of being cold, being
[1:25:06.540 --> 1:25:07.540]  total enslaved.
[1:25:07.540 --> 1:25:11.340]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making
[1:25:11.340 --> 1:25:12.340]  that move.
[1:25:12.340 --> 1:25:16.340]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with
[1:25:16.340 --> 1:25:22.020]  the third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis,
[1:25:22.020 --> 1:25:26.940]  under such a load, capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that
[1:25:26.940 --> 1:25:32.620]  they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees, not fleeing COVID or climate
[1:25:32.620 --> 1:25:38.100]  change, as the UN and Klaus Schwabber and Bill Gates are saying, but fleeing the year-long
[1:25:38.100 --> 1:25:44.060]  lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't get more
[1:25:44.060 --> 1:25:46.180]  IMF and World Bank money.
[1:25:46.180 --> 1:25:50.140]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[1:25:50.140 --> 1:25:55.140]  It's so hard for me when I'm cutting ads to not get overly excited.
[1:25:55.140 --> 1:25:58.140]  People ask me all the time, they go, Joe, you want cocaine or you want meth?
[1:25:58.140 --> 1:25:59.140]  How are you so excited?
[1:25:59.140 --> 1:26:02.500]  How do I not get excited about world government?
[1:26:02.500 --> 1:26:03.500]  It's so hard.
[1:26:03.500 --> 1:26:04.500]  It's so hard.
[1:26:04.500 --> 1:26:05.500]  It's so hard.
[1:26:05.500 --> 1:26:06.500]  It's so hard.
[1:26:06.500 --> 1:26:07.500]  It's so hard.
[1:26:07.500 --> 1:26:08.500]  It's so hard.
[1:26:08.500 --> 1:26:09.500]  It's so hard.
[1:26:09.500 --> 1:26:10.500]  It's so hard.
[1:26:10.500 --> 1:26:11.500]  It's so hard.
[1:26:11.500 --> 1:26:12.500]  It's so hard.
[1:26:12.500 --> 1:26:13.500]  It's so hard.
[1:26:13.500 --> 1:26:14.500]  It's so hard.
[1:26:14.500 --> 1:26:15.500]  It's so hard.
[1:26:15.500 --> 1:26:16.500]  It's so hard.
[1:26:16.500 --> 1:26:17.500]  I'm sorry.
[1:26:17.500 --> 1:26:18.500]  I'm a fighter.
[1:26:18.500 --> 1:26:20.500]  And I know many of you out there are watching and listening are fighters as well.
[1:26:20.500 --> 1:26:21.500]  And so I'll just say this.
[1:26:21.500 --> 1:26:22.500]  I try to be calm.
[1:26:22.500 --> 1:26:23.500]  I try to be focused.
[1:26:23.500 --> 1:26:24.500]  I don't know what I'd do if I wasn't still on air right now.
[1:26:24.500 --> 1:26:25.500]  But I just really want to thank you for keeping us on air.
[1:26:25.500 --> 1:26:29.500]  Because you have to realize when I tell you that you're the infomer, that's not me,
[1:26:29.500 --> 1:26:32.500]  that's not Matt on the head.
[1:26:32.500 --> 1:26:35.500]  You are 99% of the equation.
[1:26:35.500 --> 1:26:39.500]  So when you decide to spread the word, when you decide to buy the products,
[1:26:39.500 --> 1:26:41.500]  info-warst树.com, when you decide to share the articles of videos we've produced,
[1:26:41.500 --> 1:26:42.500]  it changes the world.
[1:26:42.500 --> 1:26:43.500]  So you are the InfoWAR.
[1:26:43.500 --> 1:26:45.500]  Thank you so much for the fight.
[1:26:45.500 --> 1:26:47.500]  Thank you for all you've done.
[1:26:47.500 --> 1:26:51.500]  Now let's take action together and take down the globalists.
[1:26:51.500 --> 1:26:58.200]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[1:26:58.200 --> 1:27:16.320]  Infowars has been banned, arrested, attacked, and threatened.
[1:27:16.320 --> 1:27:21.080]  Because we are effective, the Great Awakening is here.
[1:27:21.080 --> 1:27:27.800]  Go to banned.video, download the videos, and share.
[1:27:27.800 --> 1:27:45.800]  Visit theinformationwar at infowarstore.com, and never give up the fight.
[1:27:45.800 --> 1:27:52.800]  Infowars.com
[1:27:52.800 --> 1:28:00.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:28:00.800 --> 1:28:24.800]  Defending the Republic from enemies born and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[1:28:24.800 --> 1:28:31.800]  Welcome back to the live Alex Jones Show. I'm Alex Jones, your host. This is again Infowars and News Wars.
[1:28:31.800 --> 1:28:37.800]  In banned.video, those are the places you can find this information that the globalists don't want you and your family to have.
[1:28:37.800 --> 1:28:42.800]  There is a planetary plan to reduce world population and bring in a new silicon-based civilization.
[1:28:42.800 --> 1:28:49.800]  It is an extremely bold plan. It makes Hitler's wild megalomania look sane.
[1:28:49.800 --> 1:28:58.800]  It makes the Communist horrible behavior look sane. This is absolute total scientific dictatorship.
[1:28:58.800 --> 1:29:09.800]  And what Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab were doing is so bold in their own words to take over the human DNA to capture control of the life processes of all life forms on this planet.
[1:29:09.800 --> 1:29:17.800]  These are the stated goals of the Great Reset and the Davos Group, which is really just the Club of Rome, Bilderberg 2.0.
[1:29:17.800 --> 1:29:23.800]  But again, the good news. I have thousands of pieces of information I can give you, but the big ones to understand and I'm going to keep hammering is,
[1:29:23.800 --> 1:29:35.800]  all these large countries have said no, like India and others, to the mRNA vaccines because it's causing so many deaths, so much illness, so many neurological disorders.
[1:29:35.800 --> 1:29:42.800]  That's just one example of Bill Gates had all this tested on animals. When they say, oh, we skipped animal trials, that's not true.
[1:29:42.800 --> 1:29:52.800]  Under different names, the very same type coronavirus, Camero vaccines in the last decade plus, have been heavily tested in China, the U.S. and other countries.
[1:29:52.800 --> 1:29:59.800]  And a year ago, we showed you all those documents. They tested them in every basic animal you can imagine, a mammal.
[1:29:59.800 --> 1:30:10.800]  Everything from guinea pigs to lab rats, and they knew that it was sterilizing them and causing autoimmune disorders and cytokine storms and total organ failure and the rest of it.
[1:30:10.800 --> 1:30:18.800]  That's why we're like, hey, we're not going to do animal testing. We're going to warp speed. And Trump got suckered into that because he thought it was a regular vaccine.
[1:30:18.800 --> 1:30:23.800]  And he thought, oh, that we can reopen because he knew it was an economic attack. You know, well, let's just reopen it.
[1:30:23.800 --> 1:30:28.800]  He said, oh, the old people need it, which turned out not to be true. Nobody needs it. And you don't have to take it.
[1:30:28.800 --> 1:30:34.800]  I'm not an apologist for Trump. We've already passed that point. Now you talk about warp speed. You can see that was all Fauci's operation.
[1:30:34.800 --> 1:30:40.800]  And Biden has taken it up. He's really emblematic of the collapsing establishment, trying to collapse our country.
[1:30:40.800 --> 1:30:48.800]  He's a fitting tombstone to our republic born July 4, 1776 died, January 20, 2021.
[1:30:48.800 --> 1:30:53.800]  But again, you can resurrect the country. You can't resurrect a person. So I say, America's dead.
[1:30:53.800 --> 1:31:00.800]  We have to be really honest about we're in the process of being lowered into the ground, I guess, 666 feet right now.
[1:31:00.800 --> 1:31:10.800]  We might want to wake up to that. But the fact that Bill Gates is doing this giant, aggressive, bold move and the group behind him,
[1:31:10.800 --> 1:31:13.800]  we knew was coming because they've been planning this to bring in world government forever.
[1:31:13.800 --> 1:31:17.800]  That's how people see the videos I shot 20 years ago, 10 years ago, five years ago.
[1:31:17.800 --> 1:31:23.800]  And they go, this bounds a profit because people don't go off documents. They hear me saying, I came up with this.
[1:31:23.800 --> 1:31:27.800]  I did not come up with this. This is all in the documents. Now there are a lot of documents.
[1:31:27.800 --> 1:31:31.800]  I know which ones are the most important Rockefeller Foundation, Carnegie Endowment,
[1:31:31.800 --> 1:31:36.800]  UN Biological Diversity summits. And I know who the main players are.
[1:31:36.800 --> 1:31:42.800]  And when they do make their statements because it's metaphysical, they have to make their statements like it's fine print.
[1:31:42.800 --> 1:31:46.800]  And they'll make it somewhere and it'll be publicly available, but in the very obscure place.
[1:31:46.800 --> 1:31:53.800]  And then it's up to you to say no to it because they metaphysically, karmically know that if they just outright kill you,
[1:31:53.800 --> 1:31:58.800]  it comes back on them or you have a right to kill them. They want to trick you into accepting it.
[1:31:58.800 --> 1:32:04.800]  Now they crossed the Rubicon last week when Biden said, we're going to vaccinate newborn foster children.
[1:32:04.800 --> 1:32:09.800]  That's literally the most innocent, the most unprotected, the most isolated.
[1:32:09.800 --> 1:32:15.800]  The left goes, oh, don't use it on lab rats or monkeys, but use it on newborn babies.
[1:32:15.800 --> 1:32:23.800]  And even the mainline eugenics groups went, oh, American Medical Association went, what?
[1:32:23.800 --> 1:32:29.800]  You're going to give an experimental vaccine to a newborn baby that the disease doesn't even target
[1:32:29.800 --> 1:32:33.800]  and they can only have problems and they don't have consent and it's going to be orphaned kids.
[1:32:33.800 --> 1:32:37.800]  So it's the state is going to be their mommy, their daddy decided to experiment on them.
[1:32:37.800 --> 1:32:40.800]  This is Joseph Mengele level stuff, folks. This is Mengele death stuff.
[1:32:40.800 --> 1:32:45.800]  So yeah, we crossed the Rubicon now and I just wanted to make this point.
[1:32:45.800 --> 1:32:50.800]  I had lunch with a smart person there today and they said, Alex, one area we think you really ought to get into
[1:32:50.800 --> 1:32:55.800]  and they're absolutely right and I saw an illustration of it last night at Alfie Oaks,
[1:32:55.800 --> 1:33:02.800]  great seat-to-table grocery store in Naples. Hundreds of people came out to see us
[1:33:02.800 --> 1:33:06.800]  and I'd say about half of them were immigrants to this country who are now U.S. citizens.
[1:33:06.800 --> 1:33:10.800]  They were from Eastern Europe. They were from Latin America. They were from Africa.
[1:33:10.800 --> 1:33:14.800]  They were from all over the world and they had tears in their eyes because they ran away from tyranny.
[1:33:14.800 --> 1:33:17.800]  They know what it looks like. They love America and they see it being taken.
[1:33:17.800 --> 1:33:23.800]  Then they see the third world being collapsed and people coming here and just being given everything
[1:33:23.800 --> 1:33:27.800]  because they're being put on the globalist communist bandwagon to also be exploited.
[1:33:27.800 --> 1:33:33.800]  So they understand the dangers of what they left and that if you don't take that and filter that out
[1:33:33.800 --> 1:33:38.800]  and Americanize people and Westernize people, it is destructive and they are the most informed
[1:33:38.800 --> 1:33:42.800]  and that's the real group, probably 20 million up in this country that we need to reach out to
[1:33:42.800 --> 1:33:48.800]  to be ambassadors to their communities that are here and the communities that are going to be brought here
[1:33:48.800 --> 1:33:53.800]  from where they came from, not going through the citizenship process but from the brainwashing process of the left.
[1:33:53.800 --> 1:33:58.800]  They're now even getting rid of regular citizenship training. It's going to pure SJW communists.
[1:33:58.800 --> 1:34:04.800]  So now immigrants that have been something good for our country when controlled and filtered for quality
[1:34:04.800 --> 1:34:07.800]  he is now going to be pure cobra poison in our veins.
[1:34:07.800 --> 1:34:12.800]  So we've got to really reach out to that group and I saw that hours after I had lunch with this person
[1:34:12.800 --> 1:34:18.800]  that gave me this great advice, Sage advice, that it was about half folks that had come here and become citizens
[1:34:18.800 --> 1:34:23.800]  because I talked to them and they were the most energized, just absolutely informed folks
[1:34:23.800 --> 1:34:29.800]  and it was beautiful and they were every shape, color and size and it was very, very powerful evening
[1:34:29.800 --> 1:34:34.800]  and just a wonderful time and it's so exciting to have us have community.
[1:34:34.800 --> 1:34:38.800]  The globalists want to get rid of community. They want to isolate us. They want to make us depressed.
[1:34:38.800 --> 1:34:44.800]  That's all their own big tech documents that they want you alone with avatar bots that aren't even people
[1:34:44.800 --> 1:34:50.800]  that you talk to or people that so align themselves with avatars and bots that they basically regurgitate
[1:34:50.800 --> 1:34:54.800]  what other avatars and bots said, they call them megaphones or sock puppets
[1:34:54.800 --> 1:35:00.800]  to where now you're just a ring of robots talking to humans who themselves are becoming robots
[1:35:00.800 --> 1:35:03.800]  and that's really the end game of Klaus Schwab and the enemy.
[1:35:03.800 --> 1:35:07.800]  So that's a few of the points I wanted to make there.
[1:35:07.800 --> 1:35:14.800]  They want us to get numb to hearing about this lady died, this guy died, this baby died, this whole woman died, this whole man died.
[1:35:14.800 --> 1:35:20.800]  Yeah, they shot 100 people in nursing homes, 7 of them died. I mean, these are the real reports
[1:35:20.800 --> 1:35:23.800]  and people are like, what the hell is going on here?
[1:35:23.800 --> 1:35:27.800]  That pregnant women are having miscarriages when they take these things, of course they do.
[1:35:27.800 --> 1:35:32.800]  So the system's answer is, we'll get it to babies, we'll give it to pregnant women.
[1:35:32.800 --> 1:35:34.800]  Well, the way it's killing them, well, we're going to do it.
[1:35:34.800 --> 1:35:37.800]  So it's, again, they're throwing at your face, trying to break your will,
[1:35:37.800 --> 1:35:42.800]  they're trying to condition you to normalize that they just come give us shots and large numbers of us die
[1:35:42.800 --> 1:35:47.800]  or large numbers of us have convulsions and then are away on the society until the society's so weighed down
[1:35:47.800 --> 1:35:54.800]  we accept mass public eugenics to get rid of all the dead and dying that are around us and a huge project.
[1:35:54.800 --> 1:35:58.800]  And that's their master plan. I've seen the whole dystopia, I've studied it.
[1:35:58.800 --> 1:36:00.800]  It's not even connecting dots at this point.
[1:36:00.800 --> 1:36:04.800]  The whole thing is like a Rembrandt of evil, a Sistine Chapel of hell,
[1:36:04.800 --> 1:36:08.800]  a Hieronymus boss, a vision of Satan's heaven.
[1:36:08.800 --> 1:36:12.800]  And it's all there and you'll just look at it and realize it and understand it.
[1:36:12.800 --> 1:36:18.800]  They put out thousands of spectrums of BS and false paradigms and false ideologies to manipulate and keep you confused.
[1:36:18.800 --> 1:36:24.800]  We have the ideology, we have the system, we know what's going on and we're not telling you to go through us
[1:36:24.800 --> 1:36:28.800]  or even buy a book to learn it or go through some rings of control.
[1:36:28.800 --> 1:36:32.800]  You can go out and interface it, look at it now, learn about the globalist
[1:36:32.800 --> 1:36:34.800]  and then make your own decisions how you're going to fight it.
[1:36:34.800 --> 1:36:38.800]  But they are aggressively coming to kill you with a soft-kill weapon so they have plausible liability.
[1:36:38.800 --> 1:36:41.800]  We also need funding, more funding than ever because I want to expand.
[1:36:41.800 --> 1:36:44.800]  There's a lot of people that need my help and it's going to take money to do it.
[1:36:44.800 --> 1:36:49.800]  And if I have to sit there and penny pinch and play games during this war, then we're going to lose.
[1:36:49.800 --> 1:36:51.800]  So buy the products, you need them anyways.
[1:36:51.800 --> 1:36:56.800]  Vital mineral fusion back in stock, 50% off, free shipping still, alpha power sold out.
[1:36:56.800 --> 1:36:58.800]  Great for men and women's libido and stamina.
[1:36:58.800 --> 1:37:03.800]  I can't even take it, it makes me so aggressive and barrel and it's just ridiculous.
[1:37:03.800 --> 1:37:06.800]  But it helps a lot of folks.
[1:37:06.800 --> 1:37:09.800]  It's not even a pinch of product but I can't even take it.
[1:37:09.800 --> 1:37:14.800]  We also have the liquid form of rocket rest, very strong, amazing.
[1:37:14.800 --> 1:37:17.800]  And I'm not knocking knockout, it's just not as strong and it's great.
[1:37:17.800 --> 1:37:21.800]  But this is down and out, super amazing for deep clean sleep.
[1:37:21.800 --> 1:37:24.800]  Something I do need to take, I should have took it on this trip with me
[1:37:24.800 --> 1:37:26.800]  because you get such restful good deep sleep when you do it.
[1:37:26.800 --> 1:37:28.800]  Please buy products whenever you can.
[1:37:28.800 --> 1:37:32.800]  Get coffee from us, ours is really high quality, you'll like it at a great price.
[1:37:32.800 --> 1:37:36.800]  Buy books, buy films and tell folks on the broadcast that's how we win this war.
[1:37:36.800 --> 1:37:38.800]  All right, back to Owen with the live transmission in Austin.
[1:37:38.800 --> 1:37:42.800]  And I'll do one more short video coming up to introduce this interview I did.
[1:37:48.800 --> 1:37:52.800]  Listers ask me all the time why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[1:37:52.800 --> 1:37:54.800]  Why do you have multiple high quality iodine?
[1:37:54.800 --> 1:37:55.800]  Why do you do that?
[1:37:55.800 --> 1:37:58.800]  Because different strokes for different folks.
[1:37:58.800 --> 1:38:00.800]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say,
[1:38:00.800 --> 1:38:05.480]  say, hey, a lot of people love deep earth pure crystal iodine, but you should put one
[1:38:05.480 --> 1:38:09.640]  out with deeper crystal iodine and the two other types because some people can't absorb
[1:38:09.640 --> 1:38:10.640]  pure iodine.
[1:38:10.640 --> 1:38:11.640]  Boom, we did it.
[1:38:11.640 --> 1:38:12.640]  It's popular.
[1:38:12.640 --> 1:38:13.640]  It's X3.
[1:38:13.640 --> 1:38:14.640]  Is it better than X2?
[1:38:14.640 --> 1:38:15.640]  You decide.
[1:38:15.640 --> 1:38:16.640]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[1:38:16.640 --> 1:38:22.000]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular powdered pill sleeping,
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:23.400]  and that is down and out.
[1:38:23.400 --> 1:38:28.320]  It's super strong, way stronger than knocked out, but they don't compete with each other.
[1:38:28.320 --> 1:38:33.120]  It's strokes for different folks, different formulas, and it's 40% off out of the gates
[1:38:33.120 --> 1:38:35.560]  at mforestore.com and free shipping.
[1:38:35.560 --> 1:38:38.360]  Secure your down and out today, and while you're sleeping, you know you're funding the

[1:38:39.760 --> 1:38:49.280]  Down and out, exclusively available at mforestore.com or 40% off and free shipping.
[1:38:49.280 --> 1:38:52.720]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[1:38:52.720 --> 1:38:56.920]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that, but
[1:38:56.920 --> 1:39:00.080]  let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck.
[1:39:00.080 --> 1:39:03.160]  The big globalist publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they
[1:39:03.160 --> 1:39:04.480]  can to shut us down.
[1:39:04.480 --> 1:39:09.120]  So please pray to keep M4s on the air, and please support the local states you're listening
[1:39:09.120 --> 1:39:10.120]  to as well.
[1:39:10.120 --> 1:39:15.920]  At the same time, go to mforestore.com while you still can, and get a book, get a film,
[1:39:15.920 --> 1:39:20.800]  get a t-shirt, get some supplements, because it's that money that helps us stay on air
[1:39:20.800 --> 1:39:22.280]  in the face of this thing.
[1:39:22.280 --> 1:39:24.400]  I need your help more than ever now.
[1:39:24.400 --> 1:39:28.760]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[1:39:28.760 --> 1:39:34.120]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy great
[1:39:34.120 --> 1:39:39.360]  products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at mforestore.com.
[1:39:39.360 --> 1:39:44.120]  Whether it's high quality coffee, or supplements, or books or films, all of it nurtures the
[1:39:44.120 --> 1:39:48.920]  soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[1:39:48.920 --> 1:39:51.280]  Thank you so much.
[1:39:51.280 --> 1:39:55.320]  The general public has finally figured out why I'm upset.
[1:39:55.320 --> 1:39:58.320]  They figured out that the globalists are literally trying to kill us.
[1:39:58.320 --> 1:40:02.960]  They're trying to take over civilization and society, and they depend on the public being
[1:40:02.960 --> 1:40:03.960]  ignorant.
[1:40:03.960 --> 1:40:07.880]  That's what Jesus said, my people perish for lack of knowledge.
[1:40:07.880 --> 1:40:09.160]  Knowledge is power.
[1:40:09.160 --> 1:40:14.960]  Like our bodies are made up of all these tissues and all these systems that die without essential
[1:40:14.960 --> 1:40:16.760]  vitamins and minerals.
[1:40:16.760 --> 1:40:20.040]  And that's why they don't want you to know about essential vitamins and minerals, because
[1:40:20.040 --> 1:40:22.840]  it's so simple, because you won't be under their control anymore.
[1:40:22.840 --> 1:40:26.840]  Well, the vitamin and mineral fusion, the highest quality vitamin and mineral fusion
[1:40:26.840 --> 1:40:31.320]  system out there in a liquid vitamin form is now back in stock at mforestore.com.
[1:40:31.320 --> 1:40:36.320]  And it's not just an incredible formula at a great price, it funds the info war at the
[1:40:36.320 --> 1:40:37.320]  same time.
[1:40:37.320 --> 1:40:39.640]  No other product you can buy does that.
[1:40:39.640 --> 1:40:43.920]  So again, mforestore.com, it's back in stock, 50% off.
[1:40:43.920 --> 1:40:47.120]  Vitamin and mineral fusion, I'm going to keep it at that until it sells out.
[1:40:47.120 --> 1:40:51.480]  Now take action today and give it to your first family as a gift.
[1:40:51.480 --> 1:40:53.040]  The people are awakening.
[1:40:53.040 --> 1:40:55.800]  They're taking control of their own environment.
[1:40:55.800 --> 1:40:57.440]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[1:40:57.440 --> 1:41:00.240]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[1:41:00.240 --> 1:41:04.400]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the Chai
[1:41:04.400 --> 1:41:10.040]  Comps especially, are using this to steal your data, to share your data, to be able
[1:41:10.040 --> 1:41:14.560]  to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data that can actually
[1:41:14.560 --> 1:41:18.280]  predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[1:41:18.280 --> 1:41:25.080]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[1:41:25.080 --> 1:41:26.480]  In their own words, they admit it.
[1:41:26.480 --> 1:41:30.280]  So I've been selling privacy pouches and pocket pockets and things like that for more
[1:41:30.280 --> 1:41:31.280]  than a decade.
[1:41:31.280 --> 1:41:33.400]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[1:41:33.400 --> 1:41:34.400]  They're Faraday cages.
[1:41:34.400 --> 1:41:36.160]  They just look like a cloth envelope.
[1:41:36.160 --> 1:41:38.160]  They work absolutely great.
[1:41:38.160 --> 1:41:43.160]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity
[1:41:43.160 --> 1:41:46.240]  when you are traveling and don't want a big brother to know what you're up to because
[1:41:46.240 --> 1:41:47.240]  it's other business.
[1:41:47.240 --> 1:41:53.360]  Get yours at m4store.com today.
[1:41:53.360 --> 1:42:08.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:42:08.240 --> 1:42:13.040]  We're back here on the Alex Jones Show, Owen Schreuer in studio.
[1:42:13.040 --> 1:42:18.440]  We're going to be hearing in the next hour from Alex Jones at the Awakening World Truth
[1:42:18.440 --> 1:42:19.440]  Summit.
[1:42:19.440 --> 1:42:20.440]  And that will be taking up the entire next hour.
[1:42:20.440 --> 1:42:23.080]  So this is going to be the last hour for me doing news.
[1:42:23.080 --> 1:42:24.480]  And then Jay Dyer has the fourth hour.
[1:42:24.480 --> 1:42:27.080]  And then I'll be back hosting the war room for three hours while I'll be covering the
[1:42:27.080 --> 1:42:29.920]  latest breaking news and taking phone calls.
[1:42:29.920 --> 1:42:37.360]  But you know, here's what this comes down to right now.
[1:42:37.360 --> 1:42:39.720]  I don't want to be treated like a child.
[1:42:39.720 --> 1:42:42.160]  I don't want to be treated like a mental patient.
[1:42:42.160 --> 1:42:44.440]  I don't want to be treated like a physically ill person.
[1:42:44.440 --> 1:42:49.960]  And we're now being indoctrinated into a world where every individual is treated like a mentally
[1:42:49.960 --> 1:42:53.760]  retarded person or a physically sick person.
[1:42:53.760 --> 1:42:56.640]  And it's all liberal Democrat policy.
[1:42:56.640 --> 1:42:57.640]  Because they're mentally ill.
[1:42:57.640 --> 1:43:01.960]  They have the liberal brain bug, the liberal pathogen that makes them mentally ill.
[1:43:01.960 --> 1:43:04.200]  And so they want to infect the rest of us with it.
[1:43:04.200 --> 1:43:06.240]  And they want to force us into it.
[1:43:06.240 --> 1:43:10.080]  Well, I'm sick of being treated like a mentally retarded person.
[1:43:10.080 --> 1:43:16.240]  I'm sick of being treated like somebody who is sick all the time.
[1:43:16.240 --> 1:43:20.480]  And I think everybody is getting sick of this too.
[1:43:20.480 --> 1:43:23.400]  Oh, wear the mask.
[1:43:23.400 --> 1:43:25.400]  Oh, you can't go to church.
[1:43:25.400 --> 1:43:26.400]  You can't go to school.
[1:43:26.400 --> 1:43:28.360]  No, you can't open your business.
[1:43:28.360 --> 1:43:30.800]  No, no.
[1:43:30.800 --> 1:43:33.800]  All for a fake pandemic.
[1:43:33.800 --> 1:43:48.880]  It's just so frustrating, the gears turning in my head, but that's what it is.
[1:43:48.880 --> 1:43:52.640]  It's the nanny state.
[1:43:52.640 --> 1:44:02.200]  And it's not popular, but because the liberal Democrat pathogen has infected the media,
[1:44:02.200 --> 1:44:11.280]  it's infected Hollywood, we're now all facing this.
[1:44:11.280 --> 1:44:13.480]  All of us.
[1:44:13.480 --> 1:44:18.080]  All of us yearning to be free, staring at the Democrat tyranny, staring the New World
[1:44:18.080 --> 1:44:20.720]  Order medical tyranny in the face.
[1:44:20.720 --> 1:44:28.280]  Oh, oh, and then yesterday, oh my gosh, I'm telling you, man, I'm just, Democrats are
[1:44:28.280 --> 1:44:30.720]  such liars.
[1:44:30.720 --> 1:44:33.080]  It's stunning.
[1:44:33.080 --> 1:44:39.680]  Steve Adler yesterday, guys, see if you can find the tweet from Steve Adler where he said,
[1:44:39.680 --> 1:44:43.640]  it's the same people that are telling you not to wear a mask that were responsible for
[1:44:43.640 --> 1:44:48.560]  the power outages and the water being shut off in Texas.
[1:44:48.560 --> 1:44:50.120]  What a liar.
[1:44:50.120 --> 1:44:56.360]  It's like, do I really have to go back on that?
[1:44:56.360 --> 1:45:02.320]  Steve Adler, the corrupt mayor here, the scumbag, from the people who brought you no water and
[1:45:02.320 --> 1:45:10.800]  no electricity, no masks, what a liar, liar, liar, liar, liar, liar, like, do I really
[1:45:10.800 --> 1:45:12.080]  have to explain what happened?
[1:45:12.080 --> 1:45:14.560]  No, it was Democrat policy that shut the water off.
[1:45:14.560 --> 1:45:19.640]  It was Democrat policy that shut the electricity off and everybody knows it and you lie because
[1:45:19.640 --> 1:45:21.600]  you're a liar.
[1:45:21.600 --> 1:45:24.440]  Steve Adler is a liar.
[1:45:24.440 --> 1:45:28.440]  Democrats are liars.
[1:45:28.440 --> 1:45:31.120]  What happened to freedom?
[1:45:31.120 --> 1:45:32.840]  What happened to my body, my choice?
[1:45:32.840 --> 1:45:35.880]  What happened to personal responsibility?
[1:45:35.880 --> 1:45:38.600]  What happened to the greatest thing to fear is fear itself.
[1:45:38.600 --> 1:45:41.400]  You liars.
[1:45:41.400 --> 1:45:44.680]  You Democrat liars.
[1:45:44.680 --> 1:45:45.920]  We are sick of you.
[1:45:45.920 --> 1:45:48.440]  You are ruining everything that is good.
[1:45:48.440 --> 1:45:51.640]  You are ruining everything that is prosperous.
[1:45:51.640 --> 1:45:58.320]  You are turning the world into a slave planet and you're lying about it.
[1:45:58.320 --> 1:46:05.560]  No, we all know why the power got shut off, Democrat policy and the Paris Climate Accord.
[1:46:05.560 --> 1:46:09.360]  But Steve Adler lies and said, oh, the same people that don't want you to wear a mask,
[1:46:09.360 --> 1:46:13.880]  they don't want you to have power, liar.
[1:46:13.880 --> 1:46:16.720]  The Democrats shut the power off.
[1:46:16.720 --> 1:46:19.280]  The Democrats are making you wear a mask.
[1:46:19.280 --> 1:46:24.720]  The Democrats are slave drivers to their constituents.
[1:46:24.720 --> 1:46:27.240]  I can't believe this, man.
[1:46:27.240 --> 1:46:29.920]  I'm just sickened.
[1:46:29.920 --> 1:46:33.720]  I'm sick of being ruled by liars and frauds.
[1:46:33.720 --> 1:46:38.600]  I'm sick of being treated like a mental patient or like a sick patient in a hospital.
[1:46:38.600 --> 1:46:44.160]  I'm sick of it, man.
[1:46:44.160 --> 1:46:49.240]  I can't even concentrate and do this news because it's just so ridiculous.
[1:46:49.240 --> 1:46:53.320]  It's just unbelievable.
[1:46:53.320 --> 1:46:55.240]  So let me just try, though.
[1:46:55.240 --> 1:47:00.640]  Michigan bill to require trans student athletes to compete under gender identified at birth
[1:47:00.640 --> 1:47:05.240]  as 20 states of all similar laws and polls show mass support for that.
[1:47:05.240 --> 1:47:09.560]  Yeah, most people aren't stupid.
[1:47:09.560 --> 1:47:13.840]  Most people aren't liberal morons.
[1:47:13.840 --> 1:47:15.120]  We still have common sense.
[1:47:15.120 --> 1:47:18.080]  We know that men shouldn't compete with women.
[1:47:18.080 --> 1:47:19.080]  Women's rights.
[1:47:19.080 --> 1:47:20.080]  It's pro-women.
[1:47:20.080 --> 1:47:21.480]  It's women's history month.
[1:47:21.480 --> 1:47:25.040]  What good is a women's history month or women's rights if men can be women?
[1:47:25.040 --> 1:47:26.040]  You fools.
[1:47:26.040 --> 1:47:29.240]  But again, it's not about consistency.
[1:47:29.240 --> 1:47:30.720]  It's not about intellectual accuracy.
[1:47:30.720 --> 1:47:33.240]  It's about your agenda.
[1:47:33.240 --> 1:47:34.400]  So yeah, you're for women.
[1:47:34.400 --> 1:47:35.400]  You're for trans men.
[1:47:35.400 --> 1:47:36.400]  You're for anything.
[1:47:36.400 --> 1:47:40.640]  Whatever the flavor of the day is, whatever the flavor of the moment is, whatever the
[1:47:40.640 --> 1:47:43.200]  latest virtue signal is, wear three masks.
[1:47:43.200 --> 1:47:44.600]  Men can beat women up in boxing.
[1:47:44.600 --> 1:47:45.600]  You know, whatever.
[1:47:45.600 --> 1:47:46.600]  Whatever.
[1:47:46.600 --> 1:47:47.600]  I'm a good liberal.
[1:47:47.600 --> 1:47:52.760]  Yeah, men should be able to rake women in a bathroom if they claim they're a woman.
[1:47:52.760 --> 1:47:56.040]  Yeah, men should be able to compete with women if they claim they're a woman.
[1:47:56.040 --> 1:47:57.040]  But I'm also a pro-women.
[1:47:57.040 --> 1:48:01.680]  So I celebrate women even though men can be women and destroy women.
[1:48:01.680 --> 1:48:02.840]  It's great.
[1:48:02.840 --> 1:48:05.720]  It's great being a liberal idiot.
[1:48:05.720 --> 1:48:10.240]  Meanwhile, liberals love killing babies, too.
[1:48:10.240 --> 1:48:12.000]  Don't let them forget that.
[1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:16.840]  Another Texas GOP lawmaker is attempting to make abortion punishable by the death penalty.
[1:48:16.840 --> 1:48:22.440]  Well, Brian Slayton suggests that.
[1:48:22.440 --> 1:48:25.120]  I think abortions would probably stop.
[1:48:25.120 --> 1:48:27.960]  Of course, the irony is what?
[1:48:27.960 --> 1:48:31.680]  The irony is liberal Democrats will say, you can't do that.
[1:48:31.680 --> 1:48:32.960]  But wait a second.
[1:48:32.960 --> 1:48:35.320]  Abortion is the death penalty for a baby.
[1:48:35.320 --> 1:48:38.600]  So you see the irony there?
[1:48:38.600 --> 1:48:44.600]  So liberals love the death penalty if you want to kill your kid, but no capital punishment
[1:48:44.600 --> 1:48:47.680]  just when they want to kill their kid.
[1:48:47.680 --> 1:48:52.120]  So liberals, against the death penalty, except they want to kill their kid.
[1:48:52.120 --> 1:48:59.040]  Liberals, my body, my choice, except when they want to kill their kid.
[1:48:59.040 --> 1:49:02.800]  Arkansas's new abortion ban is a direct message to Amy Coney Barrett.
[1:49:02.800 --> 1:49:05.440]  This is from Slate, which is just BS.
[1:49:05.440 --> 1:49:09.760]  Coney Barrett's a total fraud anyway.
[1:49:09.760 --> 1:49:16.400]  And she's not a conservative on the Supreme Court as far as I can tell.
[1:49:16.400 --> 1:49:21.840]  But so finally, people are standing up against baby murder and trying to legislate baby murder
[1:49:21.840 --> 1:49:23.000]  out of their states.
[1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:25.160]  How dare they?
[1:49:25.160 --> 1:49:26.160]  Democrats are pissed about that.
[1:49:26.160 --> 1:49:27.160]  They love murdering babies.
[1:49:27.160 --> 1:49:30.160]  It's one of their favorite pastime activities.
[1:49:30.160 --> 1:49:36.440]  And so because Americans are sick of babies being murdered, well, the Democrats don't
[1:49:36.440 --> 1:49:37.640]  like this.
[1:49:37.640 --> 1:49:39.040]  They love their baby murder.
[1:49:39.040 --> 1:49:40.480]  They love their human sacrifice.
[1:49:40.480 --> 1:49:41.840]  They love their organ harvesting.
[1:49:41.840 --> 1:49:42.840]  This is what the Democrats are into.
[1:49:42.840 --> 1:49:47.600]  This is an evil group of terrorists that we're talking about here, the Democrat Party.
[1:49:47.600 --> 1:49:54.960]  And so now in New York, a court has ruled in favor of New York Attorney General Leticia
[1:49:54.960 --> 1:49:55.960]  James.
[1:49:55.960 --> 1:49:58.560]  I've warned you about this woman.
[1:49:58.560 --> 1:50:05.640]  And now anti-abortion protests are basically banned in New York.
[1:50:05.640 --> 1:50:10.280]  A divided federal appeals court on Wednesday ruled against anti-abortion protesters who
[1:50:10.280 --> 1:50:13.840]  have tried to discourage women from entering a reproductive health clinic in the New York
[1:50:13.840 --> 1:50:16.600]  City Bureau of Queens.
[1:50:16.600 --> 1:50:17.960]  So they stand out there.
[1:50:17.960 --> 1:50:24.880]  They tell people, First Amendment right, they're on a public sidewalk.
[1:50:24.880 --> 1:50:28.760]  And they hold signs, and they pray, and they read the Bible.
[1:50:28.760 --> 1:50:32.440]  And the New York Attorney General Leticia James, Democrat, who thinks she's king of
[1:50:32.440 --> 1:50:33.440]  the world.
[1:50:33.440 --> 1:50:38.280]  I mean, I wish I could tell you everything I knew about her, but I just can't right now.
[1:50:38.280 --> 1:50:40.280]  But let me just tell you, folks, this is bad.
[1:50:40.280 --> 1:50:41.520]  She's bad, isn't it?
[1:50:41.520 --> 1:50:43.600]  She's more than just working out of New York.
[1:50:43.600 --> 1:50:47.720]  Let me just say her reach extends to Texas somehow, where we happen to be located.
[1:50:47.720 --> 1:50:48.720]  I don't know.
[1:50:48.720 --> 1:50:49.720]  Wink, wink.
[1:50:49.720 --> 1:50:55.680]  But so she has now made it illegal for people to stand on a public sidewalk and protest
[1:50:55.680 --> 1:51:01.120]  against baby murder.
[1:51:01.120 --> 1:51:04.240]  Democrats love free speech, don't they?
[1:51:04.240 --> 1:51:05.400]  Not.
[1:51:05.400 --> 1:51:08.480]  Democrats love life, don't they?
[1:51:08.480 --> 1:51:09.480]  Not.
[1:51:09.480 --> 1:51:16.520]  Seriously, man, this party needs, we need to rid ourselves of everything that the Democrat
[1:51:16.520 --> 1:51:21.240]  Party ever stood for, including slavery and racism, the party of the KKK.
[1:51:21.240 --> 1:51:22.240]  So think about it.
[1:51:22.240 --> 1:51:26.480]  The Democrat Party, the party of the KKK, the party of murdering babies, the party of
[1:51:26.480 --> 1:51:29.880]  making you wear a mask so you can't even breathe clean air.
[1:51:29.880 --> 1:51:33.120]  This party must be eradicated from our political system.
[1:51:33.120 --> 1:51:38.040]  It is the greatest threat to America since probably anything.
[1:51:38.040 --> 1:51:41.440]  The Democrat Party is the, in fact, the Democrat Party is probably the biggest threat in America's
[1:51:41.440 --> 1:51:43.320]  history to our way of life.
[1:51:43.320 --> 1:51:47.320]  Yes, the Democrat Party was the party of the KKK and slavery.
[1:51:47.320 --> 1:51:50.440]  Yes, the Democrat Party openly promotes baby murder.
[1:51:50.440 --> 1:51:54.920]  Yes, the Democrat Party forces you to wear a mask over your face, while also wanting
[1:51:54.920 --> 1:52:00.320]  to tax you for carbon dioxide emissions, which they're now forcing you to breathe in 24-7,
[1:52:00.320 --> 1:52:03.600]  even though they claim it's deadly.
[1:52:03.600 --> 1:52:06.480]  Should we go on with why the Democrat Party is so dangerous?
[1:52:06.480 --> 1:52:11.160]  The censorship on the Internet, the ending of free speech, how they have dozens, if not
[1:52:11.160 --> 1:52:15.920]  hundreds, we don't know the number of Trump supporters being held in jail right now for
[1:52:15.920 --> 1:52:20.560]  being in D.C. on January 6th, and then they just say, we can't have any court cases because
[1:52:20.560 --> 1:52:24.360]  of COVID, but you have to stay in jail until your court case because you're a threat to
[1:52:24.360 --> 1:52:25.360]  society.
[1:52:25.360 --> 1:52:26.360]  You're an insurrectionist.
[1:52:26.360 --> 1:52:28.760]  Yeah, that's the Democrat Party.
[1:52:28.760 --> 1:52:30.200]  They're coming after your guns.
[1:52:30.200 --> 1:52:31.920]  They're coming after your kids.
[1:52:31.920 --> 1:52:35.200]  They want to force, inoculate you.
[1:52:35.200 --> 1:52:36.600]  These are demonic people.
[1:52:36.600 --> 1:52:39.160]  This is a direct threat to your family.
[1:52:39.160 --> 1:52:43.600]  As you know, we're always upping our game at M4 Wars, and we brought you a new supplement,
[1:52:43.600 --> 1:52:47.200]  a new product that we know you're going to love, especially if you have trouble sleeping.
[1:52:47.200 --> 1:52:48.280]  It is down and out.
[1:52:48.280 --> 1:52:50.080]  We don't mean bankrupt under a bridge.
[1:52:50.080 --> 1:52:53.120]  We mean down your bed, sleeping hard throughout the night.
[1:52:53.120 --> 1:52:56.160]  It's got four milligrams of high-quality melatonin.
[1:52:56.160 --> 1:52:58.720]  It's got 25 milligrams of passion flower.
[1:52:58.720 --> 1:53:02.360]  It's got 50 milligrams of Valerian root extract concentrate.
[1:53:02.360 --> 1:53:07.400]  It's got 100 milligrams of lemon balm and 150 milligrams of German chamomile.
[1:53:07.400 --> 1:53:09.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very strong formula.
[1:53:09.880 --> 1:53:13.040]  I recommend you only take a quarter or a half the first time.
[1:53:13.040 --> 1:53:15.000]  It's liquid, so it goes right to your body fast.
[1:53:15.000 --> 1:53:19.200]  If you take it sublingually under the tongue, oh, how about blasting off to sleep?
[1:53:19.200 --> 1:53:20.200]  It's incredible.
[1:53:20.200 --> 1:53:24.920]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest, and so popular, we can't keep it in stock.

[1:53:34.240 --> 1:53:49.440]  In the early 1990s, there was a really funny movie that came out called Wayne's World.
[1:53:49.440 --> 1:53:54.160]  Before I had access to your show in the mid-1990s, I went and saw that movie and thought, man,
[1:53:54.160 --> 1:53:55.160]  that was fun.
[1:53:55.160 --> 1:53:59.800]  In fact, you speak out and have your own ideas, and even if you're a nerd, you're still entertaining
[1:53:59.800 --> 1:54:00.800]  because you're real.
[1:54:00.800 --> 1:54:02.840]  Well, what do they say in Wayne's World?
[1:54:02.840 --> 1:54:03.840]  We're not worthy.
[1:54:03.840 --> 1:54:04.840]  We're not worthy.
[1:54:04.840 --> 1:54:10.800]  Every day when I cover these huge topics, I don't feel worthy to talk to you, because
[1:54:10.800 --> 1:54:13.920]  these topics are so huge, they're so real, but I'm trying to tell you the truth.
[1:54:13.920 --> 1:54:16.080]  I'm trying to get it right, and most of the time we do.
[1:54:16.080 --> 1:54:17.760]  The globalists love lying to you.
[1:54:17.760 --> 1:54:19.080]  They love manipulating you.
[1:54:19.080 --> 1:54:21.720]  They enjoy destroying humanity.
[1:54:21.720 --> 1:54:26.240]  They enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them.
[1:54:26.240 --> 1:54:29.080]  That, for me, is really fantastic and disgusting.
[1:54:29.080 --> 1:54:35.120]  So you've got to pledge for myself and the whole InfoWars crew that we will never join
[1:54:35.120 --> 1:54:36.120]  the globalists.
[1:54:36.120 --> 1:55:05.960]  They will never manipulate you, because we know we're all in this together.
[1:55:05.960 --> 1:55:23.320]  We're back here in the third hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[1:55:23.320 --> 1:55:24.760]  What we have coming up is very interesting.
[1:55:24.760 --> 1:55:27.000]  Now, it's the best of both worlds.
[1:55:27.000 --> 1:55:30.320]  I'm frustrated because I'm up here reading all the news all the time and giving you the
[1:55:30.320 --> 1:55:35.280]  bad side of things, but it's very serious.
[1:55:35.280 --> 1:55:37.600]  There is a global awakening happening, though.
[1:55:37.600 --> 1:55:38.600]  People are waking up.
[1:55:38.600 --> 1:55:42.920]  People are realizing the tyranny that is being brought down on them right now.
[1:55:42.920 --> 1:55:46.800]  They do know that it's the Democratic Party responsible for most of it.
[1:55:46.800 --> 1:55:51.560]  They do know about Bill Gates and the Eugenics programs that are being run against them right
[1:55:51.560 --> 1:55:52.560]  now.
[1:55:52.560 --> 1:55:56.040]  They do know about the Georgia Guidestones that is their operating policy.
[1:55:56.040 --> 1:55:58.640]  Only 500 million humans allowed on Earth.
[1:55:58.640 --> 1:56:00.520]  Well, that boy, that means they have to kill billions.
[1:56:00.520 --> 1:56:01.520]  You don't say.
[1:56:01.520 --> 1:56:05.400]  Bill Gates talks about it during TED Talks.
[1:56:05.400 --> 1:56:06.400]  He says, yeah, we're going to kill all humans.
[1:56:06.400 --> 1:56:07.400]  It's great.
[1:56:07.400 --> 1:56:08.400]  Then the crowd cheers.
[1:56:08.400 --> 1:56:14.800]  Then he releases a mosquito into the crowd, which is supposedly called all the birth effects
[1:56:14.800 --> 1:56:15.800]  there in Brazil.
[1:56:15.800 --> 1:56:16.800]  Nobody wants to talk about that.
[1:56:16.800 --> 1:56:21.840]  Bill Gates releases his mosquitoes into Brazil, and then you have a bunch of birth effects.
[1:56:21.840 --> 1:56:26.680]  There is an awakening to this tyranny, and there is a resistance to this tyranny.
[1:56:26.680 --> 1:56:30.040]  While the globalists and the Democrats are trying to enslave you harder than ever and
[1:56:30.040 --> 1:56:35.720]  kill you more than ever, the resistance is growing.
[1:56:35.720 --> 1:56:46.280]  You have the Awakening World Truth Summit that was launched last week, and Alex Jones
[1:56:46.280 --> 1:56:53.200]  was one of the speakers there during the live event.
[1:56:53.200 --> 1:56:57.200]  You also had David Icke and Del Bigtree and a bunch of other great people that were speaking
[1:56:57.200 --> 1:56:58.600]  there.
[1:56:58.600 --> 1:57:03.840]  But when we come back here after the short segment, we're going to be airing the Alex
[1:57:03.840 --> 1:57:07.480]  Jones speech in its entirety.
[1:57:07.480 --> 1:57:11.400]  Again, so this is the Awakening World Truth Summit.
[1:57:11.400 --> 1:57:17.520]  Researchers, reporters, authors alike were discredited and labeled conspiracy theorists.
[1:57:17.520 --> 1:57:20.920]  Now in the midst of a global pandemic, we see many of these very theories being openly
[1:57:20.920 --> 1:57:23.920]  discussed by world leaders.
[1:57:23.920 --> 1:57:27.840]  Terminologies like the Great Reset, Build Back Better, Agenda 2030, World Vaccinations,
[1:57:27.840 --> 1:57:33.760]  developing our terms being referenced in the media and by governments around the world.
[1:57:33.760 --> 1:57:38.640]  Business closures, lockdowns, tyrannical restrictions are being replicated around the world.
[1:57:38.640 --> 1:57:44.560]  And we all have a front row seat to one of the biggest societal breakdowns of our time.
[1:57:44.560 --> 1:57:45.720]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:57:45.720 --> 1:57:49.160]  Where can you go to be free from the globalist takeover?
[1:57:49.160 --> 1:57:55.040]  Where can you go to actually be free and breathe clean air and not be indoctrinated into the
[1:57:55.040 --> 1:57:56.040]  One World Government?
[1:57:56.040 --> 1:58:00.600]  We were joking in the break, is Tanzania, I mean, is it Tanzania, is Tanzania the one
[1:58:00.600 --> 1:58:03.680]  place to go where they call out the fake pandemic?
[1:58:03.680 --> 1:58:06.320]  There's other world leaders that call out the fake pandemic, but they get destroyed
[1:58:06.320 --> 1:58:11.600]  from within like Bolsonaro or Donald Trump, and then they get intimidated to go along
[1:58:11.600 --> 1:58:14.240]  with it.
[1:58:14.240 --> 1:58:20.400]  So when we come back, we're going to be airing this the entire third hour, Alex Jones at
[1:58:20.400 --> 1:58:24.120]  the Awakening World Truth Summit, and then of course, Jay Dyer in the fourth hour.
[1:58:24.120 --> 1:58:35.680]  But the question now is, how do we roll out this momentum into world freedom?
[1:58:35.680 --> 1:58:36.880]  We know how the globalists operate.
[1:58:36.880 --> 1:58:41.680]  They fake crises, they manufacture crises, they put people in fear, and then they use
[1:58:41.680 --> 1:58:50.480]  that momentum to enrich themselves and entrench themselves in the bureaucracies, in governments,
[1:58:50.480 --> 1:58:54.320]  corporate governments, local governments, media, all of it, corporate governments,
[1:58:54.320 --> 1:58:59.440]  and then just seize more power, seize, seize, more power, more power, more restrictions
[1:58:59.440 --> 1:59:02.940]  on you, more restrictions on your freedoms, more restrictions on your movements, more
[1:59:02.940 --> 1:59:08.860]  restrictions on your finances, more restrictions on your business, more restrictions on you.
[1:59:08.860 --> 1:59:15.260]  So the globalist manufacture crisis, they fake crises, and then they use that to seize
[1:59:15.260 --> 1:59:16.260]  power over you.
[1:59:16.260 --> 1:59:22.220]  How do we use knowledge and truth and information to seize our power back?
[1:59:22.220 --> 1:59:28.500]  How do we use knowledge and information and the momentum in the resistance against the
[1:59:28.500 --> 1:59:31.340]  New World Order takeover to free humanity?
[1:59:31.340 --> 1:59:33.180]  Because that's what this is all about.
[1:59:33.180 --> 1:59:34.940]  You want to know what Info Wars is really all about?
[1:59:34.940 --> 1:59:36.500]  It's all about freeing humanity.
[1:59:36.500 --> 1:59:41.220]  You want to know why politicians and media and Bill Gates and the like all hate us?
[1:59:41.220 --> 1:59:42.700]  Because we want you to be free.
[1:59:42.700 --> 1:59:44.020]  We want you to be prosperous.
[1:59:44.020 --> 1:59:48.260]  They want you to die.
[1:59:48.260 --> 1:59:51.380]  This is Greg Rees from Infowars.com.
[1:59:51.380 --> 1:59:55.540]  I have many reasons to be grateful for working at Infowars.
[1:59:55.540 --> 2:00:00.340]  One of them is that we support ourselves with great products that promote physical health
[2:00:00.340 --> 2:00:02.340]  and vitality.
[2:00:02.340 --> 2:00:08.500]  I've been using health supplements for years and I have found our products at InfowarsStore.com
[2:00:08.500 --> 2:00:13.700]  to be the best, especially our vitamin mineral fusion.
[2:00:13.700 --> 2:00:18.780]  Before trying vitamin mineral fusion, I always questioned if vitamin supplements ever actually
[2:00:18.780 --> 2:00:19.780]  did anything.
[2:00:19.780 --> 2:00:23.700]  I never felt much of an effect from other products.
[2:00:23.700 --> 2:00:28.540]  But I felt vitamin mineral fusion the first time I took it, immediately.
[2:00:28.540 --> 2:00:30.580]  I love how it dissolves in water.
[2:00:30.580 --> 2:00:32.500]  I take it every day with my supper.
[2:00:32.500 --> 2:00:37.900]  It tastes great, feels great, and right now it's 50% off.
[2:00:37.900 --> 2:00:44.780]  It sells out fast, so stock up now at 50% off at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:00:44.780 --> 2:01:09.540]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, you're listening to the Alex Jones show and now your host,
[2:01:09.540 --> 2:01:10.540]  Owen Troyer.
[2:01:10.540 --> 2:01:16.540]  Alex Jones at the Awakening World Truth Summit, very powerful, the world is awakening the
[2:01:16.540 --> 2:01:17.540]  tyranny.
[2:01:17.540 --> 2:01:22.700]  But how can we manifest that into human freedom versus the enemies of humanity who want us
[2:01:22.700 --> 2:01:24.780]  enslaved and destroyed?
[2:01:24.780 --> 2:01:26.380]  Here is Alex Jones' speech.
[2:01:26.380 --> 2:01:33.740]  I've been waiting to have this trailblazer on the program.
[2:01:33.740 --> 2:01:41.260]  He's, of course, no stranger to censorship, which is our theme for today's summit, talking
[2:01:41.260 --> 2:01:49.460]  about these censorship systems, perhaps the most censored individual in the Western Hemisphere,
[2:01:49.460 --> 2:01:51.580]  maybe the world.
[2:01:51.580 --> 2:01:56.540]  Right now I'm kind of feeling like maybe the history of the world, of course, the founder
[2:01:56.540 --> 2:02:01.020]  and host of Infowars.com.
[2:02:01.020 --> 2:02:11.220]  We're talking about Mr. Alex Jones, a pleasure, certainly very humbling to have you here,
[2:02:11.220 --> 2:02:14.180]  sir, with us, broadcasting live from Toronto, Canada.
[2:02:14.180 --> 2:02:19.340]  Well, sir, it's a real humbling to be here with you and all these other great speakers,
[2:02:19.340 --> 2:02:23.900]  everything you're saying is so on target, we have this anti-human agenda.
[2:02:23.900 --> 2:02:26.580]  Whatever you want to call it, we can all see it's anti-human.
[2:02:26.580 --> 2:02:27.580]  It's anti-family.
[2:02:27.580 --> 2:02:28.580]  It's anti-God.
[2:02:28.580 --> 2:02:29.580]  It's anti-prosperity.
[2:02:29.580 --> 2:02:30.580]  It's anti-health.
[2:02:30.580 --> 2:02:36.540]  And it is now seeking to silence all of us and doing open criminal testing of these deadly
[2:02:36.540 --> 2:02:37.540]  mRNA vaccines.
[2:02:37.540 --> 2:02:41.900]  When I was talking to Dr. Sherry Tenpinning, medical doctor, she was explaining that Johnson's
[2:02:41.900 --> 2:02:50.620]  and Johnson's is even worse because it takes a live virus carrying this RNA and it actually
[2:02:50.620 --> 2:02:53.820]  does change the DNA.
[2:02:53.820 --> 2:02:58.700]  The mRNA goes and programs the outside of the cell to then go program the cell itself.
[2:02:58.700 --> 2:03:03.500]  It's the same thing, but this is just so diabolical, so dangerous, doesn't protect people, and
[2:03:03.500 --> 2:03:07.220]  it's just causing massive amounts of death and carnage.
[2:03:07.220 --> 2:03:11.580]  And top scientists have come out, including Wolfgang Woodard, one of the head of the large
[2:03:11.580 --> 2:03:16.420]  EU advisory commissions, saying that this is population control.
[2:03:16.420 --> 2:03:18.420]  This is population reduction.
[2:03:18.420 --> 2:03:23.540]  But Hitler did it with guns and bullets and gas, and so people understood he was bad and
[2:03:23.540 --> 2:03:24.540]  stood up to him.
[2:03:24.540 --> 2:03:27.740]  They're doing it through covert medicine, and a lot of the doctors and nurses don't
[2:03:27.740 --> 2:03:28.980]  even know they're part of it.
[2:03:28.980 --> 2:03:33.180]  That's how compartmentalized it is, so what you're doing is absolutely trailblazing, and
[2:03:33.180 --> 2:03:37.460]  as I get censored, you get censored, others that can stand up, create their own platforms
[2:03:37.460 --> 2:03:40.740]  whether they be small or large like yours, and together we're going to win, but this
[2:03:40.740 --> 2:03:43.100]  really is humanity's greatest crisis.
[2:03:43.100 --> 2:03:47.140]  Well, I would say that the key word in that is together.
[2:03:47.140 --> 2:03:51.140]  And I think that it is so important why we do summits like this today is to connect with
[2:03:51.140 --> 2:03:57.720]  our brothers and sisters from all over the world, because this agenda is a global agenda.
[2:03:57.720 --> 2:04:03.140]  This initiative is something we know, obviously, that's been planned over an exceedingly long
[2:04:03.140 --> 2:04:04.140]  period of time.
[2:04:04.140 --> 2:04:12.700]  It's succession, and certainly as you bring these issues to life, it begs so many questions.
[2:04:12.700 --> 2:04:17.260]  I have like four or three or four thousand questions to ask you.
[2:04:17.260 --> 2:04:22.700]  Thankfully, I will cut it down because I know that we are at church for time, but share
[2:04:22.700 --> 2:04:25.220]  with the viewers.
[2:04:25.220 --> 2:04:31.060]  You talked about the impact of this, how would you characterize it?
[2:04:31.060 --> 2:04:36.980]  Gene therapy, is it literally a reprogramming of the human species?
[2:04:36.980 --> 2:04:42.180]  Well, absolutely, and they have real gene therapies that are very, very promising, but
[2:04:42.180 --> 2:04:47.700]  the FDA want to prove things like colon cancer, they have an almost 100% cure of the Texas
[2:04:47.700 --> 2:04:53.020]  company Nexigen, but they won't authorize that, and surely it will probably have side
[2:04:53.020 --> 2:04:54.500]  effects down the road.
[2:04:54.500 --> 2:04:58.420]  A lot of this hasn't had long-term tests, and so we don't know, but what they're doing
[2:04:58.420 --> 2:05:06.500]  with the Moderna, the AstraZeneca, the Pfizer, especially mRNA vaccines, is literally going
[2:05:06.500 --> 2:05:12.980]  and programming the cell to then program its mitochondrial DNA to produce this spike protein
[2:05:12.980 --> 2:05:17.300]  so that your body will then have an autoimmune response to that spike protein that is in
[2:05:17.300 --> 2:05:21.860]  the entire Corona family of viruses, but then one of the big things it can do is anytime
[2:05:21.860 --> 2:05:25.820]  you come in contact with the coronavirus, one of the most common viruses out there,
[2:05:25.820 --> 2:05:29.340]  now you'll have an autoimmune response that's probably being stung by a beer or whatever.
[2:05:29.340 --> 2:05:34.060]  There's a lot of different ways to look at it, but your body then attacks itself, kind
[2:05:34.060 --> 2:05:38.900]  of like organ rejection, but it's your organs, and so that's why we've already seen so many
[2:05:38.900 --> 2:05:44.780]  people die, and the way Dr. Sherry Timpinney described it is there's an ingredient that's
[2:05:44.780 --> 2:05:50.300]  in antifreeze that's in a lot of thousands of products, and if you have taken any of
[2:05:50.300 --> 2:05:55.540]  those products, well, now that this is in some of the mRNA vaccines, you will then have
[2:05:55.540 --> 2:06:00.620]  an autoimmune response to the particular chemical, and people need to see that full video.
[2:06:00.620 --> 2:06:09.100]  It's free at band.video, and the headline is Dr. exposes the dangers of these so-called
[2:06:09.100 --> 2:06:13.180]  vaccines, because, as she said, these are not vaccines, and that's what's crazy is
[2:06:13.180 --> 2:06:20.180]  this is a revolution by these mad scientists, by these eugenicists, who want to be able
[2:06:20.180 --> 2:06:24.540]  to just test things on us that have not been approved in animals or humans, and where they
[2:06:24.540 --> 2:06:28.900]  could just get away with liability protection of actually killing, naming, and sterilizing
[2:06:28.900 --> 2:06:29.900]  people en masse.
[2:06:29.900 --> 2:06:36.340]  And we know from the Pfizer vaccine and others that in the literature, the covering of the
[2:06:36.340 --> 2:06:41.660]  virus just so happens to be similar or the exact same protein in the placenta, so just
[2:06:41.660 --> 2:06:46.700]  like a virus is fast growing, the placenta that the baby attaches to in the uterus, it
[2:06:46.700 --> 2:06:52.420]  will actually destroy that, so that's why they put in the fine print, above 75 shouldn't
[2:06:52.420 --> 2:06:57.780]  take it, pregnant women shouldn't take it, and below 16, but that's just an advisory.
[2:06:57.780 --> 2:07:01.180]  They still go forward and do it, and so if you talk about eugenics, and stop me a dime,
[2:07:01.180 --> 2:07:04.380]  it's not going to just be Andrew here, but he goes back to play-dove.
[2:07:04.380 --> 2:07:15.460]  No, but so true, right, I'm sorry, but so true and compelling, and so it begs the question,
[2:07:15.460 --> 2:07:21.060]  but you've been talking about this, and this is just part of the process, it is not the
[2:07:21.060 --> 2:07:28.540]  end stage, it's an evolutionary step, right, that is part of the overall, they talk about
[2:07:28.540 --> 2:07:32.580]  lockstep, the great reset, whatever you want to call it.
[2:07:32.580 --> 2:07:37.540]  What does it feel like for you, someone who's been doing this as long as you have been,
[2:07:37.540 --> 2:07:44.940]  watched a video that you did in 2008 detailing, almost verbatim, step by step, what has happened
[2:07:44.940 --> 2:07:54.100]  in 2020, right up until today, how does that feel for you, and of course, speak to why
[2:07:54.100 --> 2:07:58.100]  they are censoring you, why they've de-platformed you, and etc.
[2:07:58.100 --> 2:08:03.460]  Well, sir, when you talked about how this has been a long-term plan just now being launched,
[2:08:03.460 --> 2:08:06.580]  I got chills earlier, because that's so true, and that's really what we have to understand
[2:08:06.580 --> 2:08:11.140]  is, they treat us like we're dumb animals, and these globalists, these crazy eugenics
[2:08:11.140 --> 2:08:14.820]  scientists that believe they're God, and believe that they're going to basically become gods
[2:08:14.820 --> 2:08:20.380]  by harnessing the secrets of our DNA in the universe, they admit that they're just using
[2:08:20.380 --> 2:08:24.820]  the virus as the pretext, Klaus Schwab said this year at Davos, he goes, we're not going
[2:08:24.820 --> 2:08:30.340]  to change the world, we're going to change you at the biological level, so this is a
[2:08:30.340 --> 2:08:37.260]  corporate takeover, not just of Monsanto, of soybeans or corn genes, but our genes,
[2:08:37.260 --> 2:08:42.380]  and so when you said this has been a long-term plan, they're just now going operational,
[2:08:42.380 --> 2:08:47.420]  I got chills because it is a long-term plan, and now, a lot of people go, man, Alex, you've
[2:08:47.420 --> 2:08:52.220]  been vindicated, what does it feel like, and I don't feel vindicated, I feel completely
[2:08:52.220 --> 2:08:57.540]  nauseous, I feel freaked out, I read all their documents, I saw them beta testing this on
[2:08:57.540 --> 2:09:01.420]  disadvantaged populations, they don't care if you're poor black or white, if they can
[2:09:01.420 --> 2:09:05.460]  get away with it, they're going to do it to anybody, but they hate everybody, and I watched
[2:09:05.460 --> 2:09:10.500]  them do it in beta and saw the thousands of declassifications of injecting people with
[2:09:10.500 --> 2:09:15.100]  syphilis and letting them die, Tuskegee, and radiating little pork, Appalachian kids to
[2:09:15.100 --> 2:09:21.100]  death in studies, and killing our own military and testing anthrax vaccines, over 20,000
[2:09:21.100 --> 2:09:25.780]  of our troops, they admit died of the anthrax vaccine that was experimentally illegal, and
[2:09:25.780 --> 2:09:30.820]  so when I see somebody like Klaus Schwab, it's a feeling beyond hatred, he literally
[2:09:30.820 --> 2:09:37.580]  has us enslaved, he has a technocracy over us, he thinks he's God, his grandfather helped
[2:09:37.580 --> 2:09:42.540]  run the Nazi atomic weapons program, light water reactors, and I've just done the research,
[2:09:42.540 --> 2:09:47.900]  and it's just horrifying to know all this and to know now, okay, this was beta and it
[2:09:47.900 --> 2:09:51.980]  was bad enough, and I knew that they were going to launch it, then they launched it,
[2:09:51.980 --> 2:09:55.620]  and now I know what comes next, and that's when I really get chills, and then feel like
[2:09:55.620 --> 2:09:58.900]  actually like a coward that I'm not physically organizing people to go after them, and I'm
[2:09:58.900 --> 2:10:04.140]  not calling for that, they want that, that's part of their plan, but the next plan is,
[2:10:04.140 --> 2:10:08.020]  and I said this before, Gates even said it last year, this is just to train us to get
[2:10:08.020 --> 2:10:12.300]  locked down, and accept that we're dirty and we're bad and we're evil, once they launch
[2:10:12.300 --> 2:10:15.420]  the next phase, they'll be a much stronger bio weapon that will kill hundreds of millions
[2:10:15.420 --> 2:10:19.140]  or billions, then they'll do the real lockdown, then once they know they've got us, they'll
[2:10:19.140 --> 2:10:22.540]  be combat robots on the street, everything you see will be fully rolled out, then they're
[2:10:22.540 --> 2:10:26.720]  going to go ahead and just release a super weapon, they're just practicing to make continued
[2:10:26.720 --> 2:10:32.420]  coverage here of Alex Jones at the Awakening World Truth Summit, and you see the videos
[2:10:32.420 --> 2:10:36.060]  of Alex from ten years ago going viral, where he predicted everything we're seeing now,
[2:10:36.060 --> 2:10:39.340]  this is going to be another one of those videos, you're going to see that video in ten years
[2:10:39.340 --> 2:10:44.340]  at this current trend, folks, and that's going to be like prophet gospel, sadly, I hope we
[2:10:44.340 --> 2:10:46.540]  can turn it around though, I don't want that to happen.
[2:10:46.540 --> 2:10:51.260]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point, it's very bittersweet, everything we've talked
[2:10:51.260 --> 2:10:54.940]  about has happened just like we said it would, and now we have a lot of credibility, but
[2:10:54.940 --> 2:10:58.460]  I don't care about that, I care about beating the new world border, and it's because we
[2:10:58.460 --> 2:11:02.900]  have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer, and I don't
[2:11:02.900 --> 2:11:06.180]  have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us, for a lot of reasons I can't
[2:11:06.180 --> 2:11:09.580]  tell you what's going on, but let's just say this, we're going to see this through to the
[2:11:09.580 --> 2:11:14.540]  end, we're going to stay on air as long as we can, so please pray for us and please buy
[2:11:14.540 --> 2:11:19.260]  the products, and then forwardstore.com, they're great products, plus they fund the operation,
[2:11:19.260 --> 2:11:23.220]  so you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great, do they fund freedom,
[2:11:23.220 --> 2:11:28.220]  no a lot of them don't, these are great products that fund freedom and fund justice, when the
[2:11:28.220 --> 2:11:32.700]  whole world's waking up and looking for truth, that's why the globalists are censoring, they
[2:11:32.700 --> 2:11:36.420]  can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air, so while you're
[2:11:36.420 --> 2:11:40.140]  at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word, download everything we've
[2:11:40.140 --> 2:11:43.780]  done you can find and save it, because who knows how long we're going to be on the air,
[2:11:43.780 --> 2:11:46.780]  and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[2:11:46.780 --> 2:11:51.900]  Listers ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins, why do you have multiple
[2:11:51.900 --> 2:11:54.140]  high quality iodines, why do you do that?
[2:11:54.140 --> 2:11:58.220]  Because different strokes for different folks, if we're talking to researchers and scientists
[2:11:58.220 --> 2:12:02.700]  and they say, hey, a lot of people love deep earth pure crystal iodine, but you should
[2:12:02.700 --> 2:12:06.500]  put one out with deeper crystal iodine and the two other types, because some people can't
[2:12:06.500 --> 2:12:11.620]  absorb pure iodine, boom, we did it, it's popular, it's X3, is it better than X2?
[2:12:11.620 --> 2:12:15.860]  You decide, it's different strokes for different folks, well now we have a compliment to knockout
[2:12:15.860 --> 2:12:22.180]  our very popular powdered pill sleeping, and that is down and out, it's super strong, way
[2:12:22.180 --> 2:12:26.860]  stronger than knockout, but they don't compete with each other, different strokes for different

[2:12:49.260 --> 2:12:55.260]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:12:55.260 --> 2:13:04.700]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're gonna go back to Alex, couple breaking news stories
[2:13:04.700 --> 2:13:14.420]  here though, Bill de Blasio announced he's running for governor of New York, imagine,
[2:13:14.420 --> 2:13:19.620]  so I guess Cuomo is pretty much considered dead meat to the democrat party, but de Blasio,
[2:13:19.620 --> 2:13:25.380]  who's just a dead meat thinks he's gonna run, that's a joke, and Biden is, apparently there's
[2:13:25.380 --> 2:13:30.860]  a live stream going on right now about to sign the $2 trillion, what they're now calling
[2:13:30.860 --> 2:13:36.260]  rescue plan, that's a total lie, we'll have more of that exposure coming up, just more
[2:13:36.260 --> 2:13:40.500]  lies from the democrat party, that's all they do, if a democrat's talking, he's lying or
[2:13:40.500 --> 2:13:45.300]  she's lying, don't trust anything these people say, they want you dead, believe me.
[2:13:45.300 --> 2:13:51.220]  Back to Alex Jones exposing all of this though, on the awakening world truth summit.
[2:13:51.220 --> 2:13:54.780]  They're just practicing to make sure that there won't be a big panic when they wipe us
[2:13:54.780 --> 2:14:00.940]  out with a real bio weapon that kills, they've got a weaponized mouse pox that kills about
[2:14:00.940 --> 2:14:06.340]  98%, it's not race specific like a lot of the other ones that actually kills, it kills
[2:14:06.340 --> 2:14:11.260]  every human group with about 98% efficiency, even if you have vitamins and minerals, and
[2:14:11.260 --> 2:14:16.740]  so we're being prepared and drilled, like Jim Jones and Ghana, he had them drink strawberry
[2:14:16.740 --> 2:14:23.260]  and grape and cherry Kool-Aid, but without cyanide, three or four times a day for a year,
[2:14:23.260 --> 2:14:27.380]  and finally when they went to drink the real Kool-Aid with the cyanide, they all died,
[2:14:27.380 --> 2:14:30.740]  and so we're getting ready to drink the Kool-Aid, and so I'm telling everybody watching, folks
[2:14:30.740 --> 2:14:34.580]  they plan on killing you and your family, you better get the word out, you better stop
[2:14:34.580 --> 2:14:39.940]  wearing the mask, you better speak up everywhere you go, I'm on a short workcation with my family
[2:14:39.940 --> 2:14:44.660]  and crew and here in Florida, and I just walk around a hotel without it, people say something,
[2:14:44.660 --> 2:14:48.180]  I give them a whole, I go lock step, they're going to kill you, the mask never come out,
[2:14:48.180 --> 2:14:52.180]  they go, I know, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I go then stop virtue signaling and leave me alone,
[2:14:52.180 --> 2:14:54.260]  because I care about you, and this is all a sigh of.
[2:14:54.260 --> 2:15:00.980]  Right, it's all a sigh of, and when you talk about the technocracy, speak to the fact that
[2:15:00.980 --> 2:15:07.700]  how, just briefly, how you qualify your information, the extent of detail that you go to, because
[2:15:07.700 --> 2:15:12.380]  again, we know how the media's been, they're mainstream news media, we know how the mass
[2:15:12.380 --> 2:15:17.060]  propagations of, I call it the weapons of mass misrepresentation, but talk about your
[2:15:17.060 --> 2:15:23.500]  qualification process, the attention to detail that you pay before you go public with your
[2:15:23.500 --> 2:15:25.420]  details, your documents, with your information.
[2:15:25.420 --> 2:15:29.820]  Well, I mean, here's my problem, I've been on there 27 years, and I'm a regular guy like
[2:15:29.820 --> 2:15:34.340]  that, 27 years, I like to have fun sometimes on a live three, four hour, five hour show,
[2:15:34.340 --> 2:15:39.180]  depending on how long I do, usually it's about three hours, and so I'll have a comic on once
[2:15:39.180 --> 2:15:43.580]  or twice a month, we'll joke around, make jokes, they go, oh, Joan says this, but he
[2:15:43.580 --> 2:15:47.860]  also says this, so I've gotten to where I really can't do the joking around sometimes,
[2:15:47.860 --> 2:15:53.020]  because in the media, twist that, edits it, takes it out of context, most of the time
[2:15:53.020 --> 2:15:57.340]  I'm very, absolutely, they saw that with, well, that was in a documentary film, and
[2:15:57.340 --> 2:16:02.100]  I said, if I only cared about myself, I would hate Donald Trump, he's ruined my life, and
[2:16:02.100 --> 2:16:05.620]  so they met Roger Stone, but Roger Stone called me that night and he goes, yeah, I've seen
[2:16:05.620 --> 2:16:08.660]  that film, you explain it in the film, they just edited that off the front and off the
[2:16:08.660 --> 2:16:13.100]  end to try to divide and conquer, so I've really got to be careful, and this stuff stresses
[2:16:13.100 --> 2:16:17.820]  me out, you know, sometimes I get bummed out, I drink too much or get upset, and I have
[2:16:17.820 --> 2:16:21.860]  an anger problem, because when you know that you're literally being prepared for annihilation
[2:16:21.860 --> 2:16:25.140]  along with everybody else, and people won't do anything about it, you tend to get mad,
[2:16:25.140 --> 2:16:29.220]  but you ask my vetting process, I'd read a lot of historical books, I'd read a lot
[2:16:29.220 --> 2:16:33.620]  of books by the globalists by the time I went on air when I was 21, and so I already know
[2:16:33.620 --> 2:16:37.340]  their plan, and so I already know they're going in a certain direction, and so they
[2:16:37.340 --> 2:16:42.140]  may throw a curveball here, they may do this play there, but I've got their playbook, I
[2:16:42.140 --> 2:16:45.620]  don't know exactly what play they're going to call when, but when I see their formation
[2:16:45.620 --> 2:16:50.060]  set up like a football analogy, I've got a good idea, and so when you read a Rockefeller
[2:16:50.060 --> 2:16:54.580]  document, or you read a Carnegie document, or you read a Bill Gates document, and then
[2:16:54.580 --> 2:17:00.100]  you notice that the UN that adopts it and calls it disease X drill the next year, they'll
[2:17:00.100 --> 2:17:04.380]  have operation lockstep, seven years ago by the Rockefellers, then they'll have a whole
[2:17:04.380 --> 2:17:11.180]  bunch of other drills by all these other governments, and dark winter and crimson contagion, and
[2:17:11.180 --> 2:17:14.900]  all these operations that are all basically the same, and then right before they launch
[2:17:14.900 --> 2:17:20.020]  the real operation, after five years, 10 years, 20 years, they will have an exact drill of
[2:17:20.020 --> 2:17:25.180]  the exact weapon in the exact places release, they'll even show the exact maps in crimson
[2:17:25.180 --> 2:17:30.460]  contagion, I'm going to cover this next week, it's so big, I've been unable to even get
[2:17:30.460 --> 2:17:35.220]  into it because I have like thousands of pages of documents, and it's all exactly how they
[2:17:35.220 --> 2:17:40.100]  then rolled it out six months later, so it's all mapped out, but they know there's intelligence
[2:17:40.100 --> 2:17:44.580]  agencies and private groups that aren't in on it who are compartmentalized, so they're
[2:17:44.580 --> 2:17:49.140]  on the phone, they're on emails, preparing all this with hundreds of thousands of folks
[2:17:49.140 --> 2:17:53.780]  that are involved, and that way it's a cover in the eugenics cult, what it is is a eugenics
[2:17:53.780 --> 2:17:57.900]  cult, to call them Nazis is too kind, this is a group that created the Nazis as a beta
[2:17:57.900 --> 2:18:02.980]  test, and then set them up, and that's a whole other area, so that's what some bone shilling
[2:18:02.980 --> 2:18:08.180]  about all of this is, is that they beta tested it, to test it out, but also in case they
[2:18:08.180 --> 2:18:12.140]  get caught, they go, oh that's just a drill, but they work them out, they war game them
[2:18:12.140 --> 2:18:16.980]  for years, and then right before they go operational, the exact plan under another name is launched,
[2:18:16.980 --> 2:18:22.340]  and that is a crimson contagion, right, and so it's interesting when you talk about the
[2:18:22.340 --> 2:18:27.540]  passion and the fact that you substantiate, it's not whimsical, you don't wake up like
[2:18:27.540 --> 2:18:32.280]  you had a dream and say, hey you know what I dreamt last night, you have mountains of
[2:18:32.280 --> 2:18:39.180]  evidentiary support, substantiated fact on record, and yet you are characterized, even
[2:18:39.180 --> 2:18:46.460]  up to yesterday, our producer Grant, we flipped over an article that was talking about that,
[2:18:46.460 --> 2:18:51.940]  you know, you were appearing on The Awakening today, and just, again, the weapons of mass
[2:18:51.940 --> 2:18:57.500]  misrepresentation, specifically, they did mention that very same excerpt about the
[2:18:57.500 --> 2:19:01.980]  Roger Stone, and President Trump, and you wishing that he never mentioned it.
[2:19:01.980 --> 2:19:05.060]  And they say, oh, Alex doesn't mean what he really, Alex doesn't mean what he really
[2:19:05.060 --> 2:19:09.900]  says because he attacked Trump, you know, that was a hypothetical, and the Judge of
[2:19:09.900 --> 2:19:14.380]  Tree by its fruits, I supported Trump, what I was saying is, I didn't do it for money,
[2:19:14.380 --> 2:19:19.580]  I lost almost all the money I've had supporting Trump, and as a fleshly person, my flesh
[2:19:19.580 --> 2:19:23.260]  does not like Donald Trump because I got hurt, but my spirit loves him.
[2:19:23.260 --> 2:19:26.500]  That's what I said in the full clip, it's in a film I'm selling, but again, that's
[2:19:26.500 --> 2:19:30.740]  how they deceive, they edit it out of context, and put out the clip where I was cussing.
[2:19:30.740 --> 2:19:36.260]  And again, the truth is, I get angry about this, and I work too much, some days I work
[2:19:36.260 --> 2:19:41.620]  18 hours, that film crew was smart, turned out they work basically with the ADL and George
[2:19:41.620 --> 2:19:45.340]  Soros, they admit it now, and they waited until like night at night to interview me,
[2:19:45.340 --> 2:19:49.900]  they had tequila over there, everything, I got tired, and so it was Vino Veritas, but
[2:19:49.900 --> 2:19:54.460]  I've already said that on Joe Rogan and my show too, that Donald Trump has destroyed
[2:19:54.460 --> 2:19:55.460]  my life.
[2:19:55.460 --> 2:19:58.460]  They'll probably put this out and say, oh look, we found a leaked clip off the Great
[2:19:58.460 --> 2:19:59.460]  Awakening.
[2:19:59.460 --> 2:20:03.580]  No, I'm saying, it's hurt a lot of people, but tell them the truth hurt me, so they
[2:20:03.580 --> 2:20:07.580]  want to change the subject, check it out folks, is Operation Lockstep real?
[2:20:07.580 --> 2:20:10.580]  Did they do Event 201 right as they actually launched the attack?
[2:20:10.580 --> 2:20:13.580]  Because it actually crimson contagion.
[2:20:13.580 --> 2:20:18.620]  Don't believe me, again, people think from that clip, 11 years ago you talked about where
[2:20:18.620 --> 2:20:23.900]  I'm like, you'll be wearing masks, you'll be locked in your house, no more ball games,
[2:20:23.900 --> 2:20:26.300]  and then I'm talking about the actual document.
[2:20:26.300 --> 2:20:31.740]  People thought that I psychically just knew this, no, it's a document, the issue is they're
[2:20:31.740 --> 2:20:38.540]  going to carry it out, and they say 90% of us must be exterminated, and so again, right
[2:20:38.540 --> 2:20:43.740]  now they're just practicing to collapse the third world because when they shut down the
[2:20:43.740 --> 2:20:48.940]  first world, the third world dies, then the third world will rush the borders, can't blame
[2:20:48.940 --> 2:20:53.780]  them, they will have the UN refugee centers brainwashing them to be anti-western, to be
[2:20:53.780 --> 2:20:55.740]  pro-UN, and then they've got us.
[2:20:55.740 --> 2:20:58.940]  They've got the west is down, the third world's down, then they're going to put in a police
[2:20:58.940 --> 2:21:03.420]  state lockdown to control the borders because we'll call for it, but the walls are going
[2:21:03.420 --> 2:21:07.260]  to be there to keep us in, like Israel has those big walls down, notice they can't get
[2:21:07.260 --> 2:21:11.860]  out, they're having to wear freedom bracelets, I said when they started a year ago, I said
[2:21:11.860 --> 2:21:17.860]  within one year, they're going to have us beta testing in Israel, in Australia, in Spain,
[2:21:17.860 --> 2:21:22.540]  and in France, bracelets, we already knew because they were already proposing in the
[2:21:22.540 --> 2:21:27.620]  Bill Gates documents, and then now, year later, boom, they're rolling it up.
[2:21:27.620 --> 2:21:33.060]  And we're hearing really scary stories coming out of Israel specifically about mass arrests,
[2:21:33.060 --> 2:21:37.780]  and of course, those who show any sign of opposition, and how they've been targeted.
[2:21:37.780 --> 2:21:45.540]  Zuticson, here in Canada, we call it dirty tricks, also known, of course, as disruption.
[2:21:45.540 --> 2:21:51.180]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes and
[2:21:51.180 --> 2:21:56.540]  full-worses that if you're paying attention, you know we've done together, but I'll tell
[2:21:56.540 --> 2:22:03.340]  you this, the technocrats are really upping their game, and they are trying to destroy
[2:22:03.340 --> 2:22:08.620]  all independent forms of media, and they're trying to shudder and silence the human resistance,
[2:22:08.620 --> 2:22:13.980]  so now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate,
[2:22:13.980 --> 2:22:17.380]  everything you warned your friends and family about is about to be true.
[2:22:17.380 --> 2:22:22.420]  So it's now that your credibility is way up, the power structures are to silence those
[2:22:22.420 --> 2:22:29.140]  of us that they can't, but it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us.
[2:22:29.140 --> 2:22:35.180]  We have the power, but the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[2:22:35.180 --> 2:22:39.500]  We have to make sure that we find hard right now to make sure that long, dark night doesn't
[2:22:39.500 --> 2:22:47.020]  come, so be the polar bears you are.
[2:22:47.020 --> 2:22:50.100]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[2:22:50.100 --> 2:22:54.140]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all going to
[2:22:54.140 --> 2:22:55.140]  pass.
[2:22:55.140 --> 2:22:58.500]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach
[2:22:58.500 --> 2:23:02.700]  a point where all the training is just beta, and you go into the point of being cold, being
[2:23:02.700 --> 2:23:06.820]  totally enslaved, and because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they
[2:23:06.820 --> 2:23:11.500]  are now making that move, and they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons
[2:23:11.500 --> 2:23:16.860]  to then flood us with the third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us
[2:23:16.860 --> 2:23:21.940]  under such a crisis, under such a load, capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us
[2:23:21.940 --> 2:23:27.220]  to sign, hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees, not fleeing
[2:23:27.220 --> 2:23:32.620]  COVID or climate change, as the UN and Klaus Schwab are saying, and Bill Gates are saying,
[2:23:32.620 --> 2:23:38.820]  but fleeing the year-long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute
[2:23:38.820 --> 2:23:44.420]  or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money, and that's why we have to really get
[2:23:44.420 --> 2:23:49.660]  educated about the globalists.
[2:23:49.660 --> 2:23:54.620]  Look, I've proven that IMF World War's information is some of the best in the world.
[2:23:54.620 --> 2:23:57.060]  It's just absolutely on target.
[2:23:57.060 --> 2:24:00.540]  The globalists can't stand us because we've studied how they operate, they want to keep
[2:24:00.540 --> 2:24:01.540]  you in the dark.
[2:24:01.540 --> 2:24:05.580]  I believe in humanity, and I want to see you empowered, because I know that John F. Kennedy
[2:24:05.580 --> 2:24:06.580]  was right.
[2:24:06.580 --> 2:24:09.420]  Our raising tide raises all ships.

[2:25:49.940 --> 2:26:07.140]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:26:07.140 --> 2:26:15.460]  We go back now to Alex Jones speaking at the Awakening World Truth Summit.
[2:26:15.460 --> 2:26:22.060]  These processes that they impose against those dissidents or those whose views or interests
[2:26:22.060 --> 2:26:28.900]  oppose their own, obviously the more powerful you are, the more powerful your voice is the
[2:26:28.900 --> 2:26:31.020]  big, great threat you pose.
[2:26:31.020 --> 2:26:38.100]  I would love to, we talk about it all the time, the misconstruction, media spins, the
[2:26:38.100 --> 2:26:43.980]  manipulation, degradation, how they go after you personally.
[2:26:43.980 --> 2:26:55.820]  Talk about how taxing that is and what you do to move through to deal with, to be able
[2:26:55.820 --> 2:27:01.860]  to still stay on target, on topic, and on task in respects to what you're called to
[2:27:01.860 --> 2:27:02.860]  do.
[2:27:02.860 --> 2:27:09.020]  Well, imagine we're in a house and we've got our children, our human community, all
[2:27:09.020 --> 2:27:10.020]  of our children are our children.
[2:27:10.020 --> 2:27:14.380]  It's true, we're all just, what David Ike says, consciousness, experience, and existence.
[2:27:14.380 --> 2:27:17.300]  That's what the enemy tries to divide us from, doesn't want to snow like Martin Luther King
[2:27:17.300 --> 2:27:18.300]  said.
[2:27:18.300 --> 2:27:20.820]  It's not the color of someone's skin, it's the kind of their character and their deed.
[2:27:20.820 --> 2:27:23.220]  It's their spirit that matters.
[2:27:23.220 --> 2:27:27.180]  Everything they do is to divide that and destroy that in the name of protecting it.
[2:27:27.180 --> 2:27:29.820]  Everything they do is inversion.
[2:27:29.820 --> 2:27:34.020]  I knew when I made my film Endgame 14 years ago from doing deep research that they were
[2:27:34.020 --> 2:27:38.060]  going to carry this plan out and they said they would be launching it by 2020 in Agenda
[2:27:38.060 --> 2:27:43.380]  21 and that by 2030 there would basically be no more hunger and poverty because they
[2:27:43.380 --> 2:27:45.540]  would have killed most of the population.
[2:27:45.540 --> 2:27:49.220]  And I knew these people had done everything they said before when they said they would
[2:27:49.220 --> 2:27:50.220]  do it.
[2:27:50.220 --> 2:27:56.620]  And so really being attacked, being sued, being lied about doesn't get to me because
[2:27:56.620 --> 2:27:58.580]  I expect this is going to happen.
[2:27:58.580 --> 2:27:59.900]  I'm not some hero.
[2:27:59.900 --> 2:28:04.180]  I would have to have blind, crazy courage to just know all this and do nothing and just
[2:28:04.180 --> 2:28:08.220]  pretend that everything's okay and I'm sure not going to join them, they've tried to get
[2:28:08.220 --> 2:28:09.220]  me to join them.
[2:28:09.220 --> 2:28:12.340]  Listen, they tried to get my dad to join them and my dad didn't tell me this.
[2:28:12.340 --> 2:28:13.660]  He's a doctor, now retired.
[2:28:13.660 --> 2:28:18.860]  He didn't tell me this until I was showing Endgame at my studios.
[2:28:18.860 --> 2:28:23.940]  My mom and dad came by to pick me up to go to my oldest daughter's ballet recital.
[2:28:23.940 --> 2:28:27.780]  She was like three years old then, she's like 17 now.
[2:28:27.780 --> 2:28:31.780]  And my mom watched the end of Endgame and she said, David, that's not true.
[2:28:31.780 --> 2:28:36.100]  Well, Garbut to exterminate everybody, he goes, well, Carol, I was in plan two, University
[2:28:36.100 --> 2:28:40.860]  of Texas when he was in high school, because he had some of the highest scores in Texas
[2:28:40.860 --> 2:28:45.340]  and he volunteered for this NASA program and it really wasn't a NASA program, I mean, just
[2:28:45.340 --> 2:28:47.900]  whiz, get stuff that Eisenhower was doing.
[2:28:47.900 --> 2:28:53.660]  And my dad wasn't getting recruited into NASA, he was getting recruited into above the CIA,
[2:28:53.660 --> 2:28:56.460]  the scientific establishment.
[2:28:56.460 --> 2:29:00.660]  And so by the time he got into college, he got out of it because he realized what it
[2:29:00.660 --> 2:29:01.660]  was.
[2:29:01.660 --> 2:29:06.260]  When he was a freshman at UT, the head of the botany department that had run the recruiting
[2:29:06.260 --> 2:29:11.140]  in plan two, where they got all these high school kids in college, my dad was in MD Anderson
[2:29:11.140 --> 2:29:16.980]  Cancer Research Facility when he was 15 in the secret areas where they had people missing
[2:29:16.980 --> 2:29:21.620]  lower mandibles, giving them all sorts of experimental stuff, people signed off to try
[2:29:21.620 --> 2:29:23.580]  to live, but they were killing people.
[2:29:23.580 --> 2:29:27.900]  And remember my dad went ahead and spilt his guts to me and he said, listen, these mad
[2:29:27.900 --> 2:29:31.660]  scientists would inject people with stuff and get off when they were like killing these
[2:29:31.660 --> 2:29:35.740]  people, give them this stuff and he said, it's basically mad scientist.
[2:29:35.740 --> 2:29:40.060]  The head of the botany department had my dad and five others that said, you're the best
[2:29:40.060 --> 2:29:41.820]  in the state we've got.
[2:29:41.820 --> 2:29:45.220]  This is eugenics, but we're not like Hitler, because this guy was Jewish.
[2:29:45.220 --> 2:29:51.420]  He said, we're going to go after everybody that isn't the elite and we're going to set
[2:29:51.420 --> 2:29:54.220]  up a world government and we're going to basically have to exterminate people to save
[2:29:54.220 --> 2:29:55.220]  the earth.
[2:29:55.220 --> 2:29:59.260]  And my dad got out of it at that point and that was that.
[2:29:59.260 --> 2:30:02.540]  But because he showed so many folks, that's how real this was.
[2:30:02.540 --> 2:30:06.980]  And it wasn't until 14 years ago that my dad saw Endgame and then the car driving over
[2:30:06.980 --> 2:30:12.340]  to the ballet spilt his guts and my mom was completely freaked out.
[2:30:12.340 --> 2:30:13.460]  I love history.
[2:30:13.460 --> 2:30:14.460]  You prefaced it.
[2:30:14.460 --> 2:30:19.660]  You talked about it in respects to your father's understanding and even the heavy.
[2:30:19.660 --> 2:30:27.180]  They certainly were seeking their suitors to utilizing or bringing them into that practice,
[2:30:27.180 --> 2:30:29.060]  that process.
[2:30:29.060 --> 2:30:38.940]  The similarities between the Gestapo, Hitler's, the Third Reich, just that overall initiative
[2:30:38.940 --> 2:30:47.820]  and it's almost, I call it like the evolution, almost like 5.0, that a lot of those same practices,
[2:30:47.820 --> 2:30:53.980]  mind control, we talk about the origins of monarch, mind control and these things.
[2:30:53.980 --> 2:30:54.980]  MKUltra.
[2:30:54.980 --> 2:30:55.980]  MKUltra.
[2:30:55.980 --> 2:30:56.980]  Right.
[2:30:56.980 --> 2:31:03.580]  And so speak to that a little bit in respects to similarities or things that you find to
[2:31:03.580 --> 2:31:04.980]  be compelling.
[2:31:04.980 --> 2:31:10.260]  That Hitler initiatives undertook ideology versus what we are seeing today, obviously
[2:31:10.260 --> 2:31:11.260]  mass surveillance.
[2:31:11.260 --> 2:31:14.620]  I would love to get into that because understanding is the key part of history.
[2:31:14.620 --> 2:31:19.300]  Just be clear, my dad was not even that super special.
[2:31:19.300 --> 2:31:25.900]  They were recruiting all the best and brightest people into this cult and they were just finding
[2:31:25.900 --> 2:31:29.900]  parents that thought, okay, yeah, great, take our son and put him in the cancer research
[2:31:29.900 --> 2:31:32.220]  deal, working with these people.
[2:31:32.220 --> 2:31:36.220]  Oh, put him in and they were taking my dad and showing him basically all the secret
[2:31:36.220 --> 2:31:39.780]  stuff just to see how he'd respond because he'd worked 20 hours a day to whatever they
[2:31:39.780 --> 2:31:40.780]  said.
[2:31:40.780 --> 2:31:45.300]  But it was just that last straw when they told him, by the way, we're going to go after
[2:31:45.300 --> 2:31:46.300]  everybody.
[2:31:46.300 --> 2:31:48.740]  And then he just quietly said, no, thank you.
[2:31:48.740 --> 2:31:50.380]  And they still came around again.
[2:31:50.380 --> 2:31:51.380]  But that's how this works.
[2:31:51.380 --> 2:31:56.260]  But going back to what you were just saying, and this is all on record, and I'll tell this
[2:31:56.260 --> 2:31:57.260]  way.
[2:31:57.260 --> 2:31:58.260]  There's a thousand ways to tell it.
[2:31:58.260 --> 2:32:01.220]  It's not different verses of the truth, it's different angles, like different chapters
[2:32:01.220 --> 2:32:02.220]  of a book.
[2:32:02.220 --> 2:32:06.220]  But Edward VIII was basically Transylvania, not even German.
[2:32:06.220 --> 2:32:10.580]  The entire British royal house of Windsor is not British and they're not even German.
[2:32:10.580 --> 2:32:11.580]  They're Transylvanian.
[2:32:11.580 --> 2:32:12.580]  Anybody can type in.
[2:32:12.580 --> 2:32:15.860]  House of Windsor is actually the house of Dracula or the Red Dragon.
[2:32:15.860 --> 2:32:18.500]  Prince Charles is the main heir to the house of Dracula.
[2:32:18.500 --> 2:32:20.660]  This is not Bram Stoker's Dracula.
[2:32:20.660 --> 2:32:27.020]  Bram Stoker was making an analogy of how evil these people are in his book.
[2:32:27.020 --> 2:32:31.780]  They don't really live forever, but the spirit that's in them lives forever and is Satan,
[2:32:31.780 --> 2:32:32.780]  basically.
[2:32:32.780 --> 2:32:33.780]  It's like the house of Satan.
[2:32:33.780 --> 2:32:39.780]  And so David Ike exposes that they interbreed because they believe somehow it helps them
[2:32:39.780 --> 2:32:44.220]  resonate with this frequency like Avatar and basically be able to take us on.
[2:32:44.220 --> 2:32:47.340]  Now that's something I don't get into because it can't be proven, but it is proven that
[2:32:47.340 --> 2:32:48.340]  they believe it.
[2:32:48.340 --> 2:32:49.340]  So I'll just move on from there.
[2:32:49.340 --> 2:32:52.300]  But you can type in Edward VIII.
[2:32:52.300 --> 2:32:56.180]  You can type in Edward VIII Hitler and it's all the photos with him with Hitler.
[2:32:56.180 --> 2:32:59.100]  And so he was going to be the head of the EU under Hitler.
[2:32:59.100 --> 2:33:04.020]  The Germans, the Nazis had an agreement with the British that he would be the head of the
[2:33:04.020 --> 2:33:05.020]  new British Empire.
[2:33:05.020 --> 2:33:09.500]  They had a peace deal with Neville Chamberlain, but then they got rid of Neville Chamberlain,
[2:33:09.500 --> 2:33:10.780]  broke that deal.
[2:33:10.780 --> 2:33:14.780]  That's why the deputy here, Albert Speer, flew over, jumped out over the royal palace
[2:33:14.780 --> 2:33:18.980]  in his parachute and was locked up in the tower one of the rest of his life, the longest
[2:33:18.980 --> 2:33:23.140]  serving person there because he had the peace treaty that was later declassified.
[2:33:23.140 --> 2:33:26.100]  And so Churchill came in and said, well, that's not our treaty.
[2:33:26.100 --> 2:33:27.100]  We're not doing it.
[2:33:27.100 --> 2:33:32.300]  And so you have to understand Hitler was set up by the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, the Kaiser
[2:33:32.300 --> 2:33:35.740]  Wilhelm Institute in Prussia.
[2:33:35.740 --> 2:33:40.340]  It was set up by Cold Springs Harbor in New York that was funded by Thomas Watson that
[2:33:40.340 --> 2:33:42.460]  created IBM.
[2:33:42.460 --> 2:33:50.020]  So IBM created computers to do race mixing studies and then to prove that minorities
[2:33:50.020 --> 2:33:52.020]  or black people around people were inferior.
[2:33:52.020 --> 2:33:53.300]  This is his mainline history.
[2:33:53.300 --> 2:33:55.780]  IBM, the Holocaust, anybody can look it up.
[2:33:55.780 --> 2:33:58.780]  So Thomas Watson goes with the British.
[2:33:58.780 --> 2:34:02.100]  He's an American, sets up Hitler, puts Hitler in power.
[2:34:02.100 --> 2:34:06.020]  They set up an EU plan, a world domination plan, how they poisoned food and water at
[2:34:06.020 --> 2:34:09.660]  first to dumb down third world populations before they killed them, how they would then
[2:34:09.660 --> 2:34:14.100]  also call off, somebody had 1% Native American, I'd be killed because I'm like, you know,
[2:34:14.100 --> 2:34:16.220]  less than 10% of us will be killed.
[2:34:16.220 --> 2:34:17.260]  And all of this happened.
[2:34:17.260 --> 2:34:21.900]  But then you can say British intelligence double cross Hitler took down that operation
[2:34:21.900 --> 2:34:25.380]  and then they still set up the operation, but it wasn't just going to be against certain
[2:34:25.380 --> 2:34:26.380]  groups.
[2:34:26.380 --> 2:34:28.380]  It was going to be against everybody.
[2:34:28.380 --> 2:34:33.580]  And then Thomas Watson's protege was Bill Gates' mother.
[2:34:33.580 --> 2:34:37.340]  She was the head of the IBM board that carried out all the eugenics operation.
[2:34:37.340 --> 2:34:42.260]  He bequeathed all of his fortune into that eugenics board that her mother then handed
[2:34:42.260 --> 2:34:43.620]  over to Bill Gates.
[2:34:43.620 --> 2:34:48.260]  And then all the other big foundations put their money into the eugenics holdings.
[2:34:48.260 --> 2:34:53.660]  All the robber barons were basically eugenicists from Henry Ford to all of them, Carnegie,
[2:34:53.660 --> 2:34:56.980]  all of them, they all put billions in their day.
[2:34:56.980 --> 2:34:58.500]  Now trillions into this.
[2:34:58.500 --> 2:35:01.940]  And so the whole world government, that's why they run the UN, it's why they run all
[2:35:01.940 --> 2:35:04.900]  the health departments, it's why they run the National Institutes of Health, it's why
[2:35:04.900 --> 2:35:08.300]  they run the National Health Service, the CDC, it's why Bill Gates has been kicked
[2:35:08.300 --> 2:35:13.220]  out of 30 certain countries for killing people with vaccines because literally they're not
[2:35:13.220 --> 2:35:14.860]  babies of Hitler.
[2:35:14.860 --> 2:35:17.220]  Hitler was just a test operation they did.
[2:35:17.220 --> 2:35:19.700]  So the people that created Hitler created this.
[2:35:19.700 --> 2:35:25.960]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we will come back with more from the full Alex Jones interview
[2:35:25.960 --> 2:35:30.380]  there on the World Awakening World Truth Summit.
[2:35:30.380 --> 2:35:36.900]  And of course, more developing the barbarian terror, terroristic lying Democrat party just
[2:35:36.900 --> 2:35:38.460]  signed a $2 trillion stimulus bill.
[2:35:38.460 --> 2:35:39.460]  They're calling it the rescue plan.
[2:35:39.460 --> 2:35:41.380]  They're saying it's going to end American poverty.
[2:35:41.380 --> 2:35:45.100]  These people cannot stop lying and cheating and stealing.
[2:35:45.100 --> 2:35:49.540]  As you know, we're always upping our game at InfoWars and we brought you a new supplement,
[2:35:49.540 --> 2:35:53.100]  a new product that we know you're going to love, especially if you have trouble sleeping.

[2:35:59.060 --> 2:36:02.100]  It's got four milligrams of high quality melatonin.
[2:36:02.100 --> 2:36:04.660]  It's got 25 milligrams of passion flower.

[2:36:13.420 --> 2:36:15.820]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very strong formula.

[2:36:18.980 --> 2:36:19.980]  It's liquid.
[2:36:19.980 --> 2:36:20.980]  So it goes right into your body fast.
[2:36:20.980 --> 2:36:25.100]  If you take it sublingually under the tongue, oh, how about blasting off of sleep?
[2:36:25.100 --> 2:36:26.100]  It's incredible.
[2:36:26.100 --> 2:36:28.380]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest.
[2:36:28.380 --> 2:36:30.900]  It's so popular we can't keep it in stock.

[2:36:45.100 --> 2:36:48.540]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[2:36:48.540 --> 2:36:52.740]  I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that.
[2:36:52.740 --> 2:36:55.940]  But let me tell you, the new world order is breathing down our neck.
[2:36:55.940 --> 2:36:59.020]  The big globalist publications are coming after us and they're doing everything they
[2:36:59.020 --> 2:37:00.340]  can to shut us down.
[2:37:00.340 --> 2:37:04.660]  So please pray to keep info wars on the air and please support the local states you're
[2:37:04.660 --> 2:37:05.660]  listening to as well.
[2:37:05.660 --> 2:37:11.780]  At the same time, go to infowarstore.com while you still can and get a book, get a film,
[2:37:11.780 --> 2:37:16.660]  get a t-shirt, get some supplements because it's that money that helps us stay on air
[2:37:16.660 --> 2:37:18.140]  in the face of this thing.
[2:37:18.140 --> 2:37:20.260]  I need your help more than ever now.
[2:37:20.260 --> 2:37:24.580]  I want to keep fighting the globalist, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[2:37:24.580 --> 2:37:29.580]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can and buy
[2:37:29.580 --> 2:37:35.220]  great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at infowarstore.com.
[2:37:35.220 --> 2:37:39.740]  Whether it's high quality coffee or supplements or books or films, all of it nurtures the
[2:37:39.740 --> 2:37:40.740]  soul.
[2:37:40.740 --> 2:37:42.260]  All of it empowers humanity.
[2:37:42.260 --> 2:37:44.780]  All of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[2:37:44.780 --> 2:37:47.060]  Thank you so much.
[2:37:47.060 --> 2:37:51.100]  The general public has finally figured out why I'm upset.
[2:37:51.100 --> 2:37:54.100]  They figured out that the globalists are literally trying to kill us.
[2:37:54.100 --> 2:37:58.700]  They're trying to take over civilization and society and they depend on the public being
[2:37:58.700 --> 2:37:59.700]  ignorant.
[2:37:59.700 --> 2:38:03.660]  That's what Jesus said, my people perish for lack of knowledge.
[2:38:03.660 --> 2:38:04.940]  Knowledge is power.
[2:38:04.940 --> 2:38:10.740]  Like our bodies are made up of all these tissues and all these systems that die without essential
[2:38:10.740 --> 2:38:12.540]  vitamins and minerals.
[2:38:12.540 --> 2:38:15.820]  And that's why they don't want you to know about essential vitamins and minerals because
[2:38:15.820 --> 2:38:18.620]  it's so simple because you won't be under their control anymore.
[2:38:18.620 --> 2:38:23.300]  Well, the vitamin mineral fusion, the highest quality vitamin mineral fusion system out
[2:38:23.300 --> 2:38:27.980]  there in a liquid vitamin form is now back in stock at infowarstore.com and it's not
[2:38:27.980 --> 2:38:33.100]  just an incredible formula at a great price, it funds the info war at the same time.
[2:38:33.100 --> 2:38:35.420]  No other product you can buy does that.
[2:38:35.420 --> 2:38:40.260]  So again, infowarstore.com, it's back in stock, 50% off, vitamin mineral fusion.
[2:38:40.260 --> 2:38:42.860]  I'm going to keep it at that until it sells out.
[2:38:42.860 --> 2:38:48.260]  So take action today and give it to your friends and family as a gift.
[2:38:48.260 --> 2:38:53.260]  The entire new world order system is about making you feel pathetic, making you feel
[2:38:53.260 --> 2:38:57.940]  weak, making you play the part of a victim so you don't take your birthright as being
[2:38:57.940 --> 2:39:03.780]  made the image of God and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will.
[2:39:03.780 --> 2:39:09.860]  Being given free will, being given consciousness is literally the seed of an entire universe,
[2:39:09.860 --> 2:39:14.540]  an entire system and the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact you're
[2:39:14.540 --> 2:39:19.020]  able to see the beauty of the sunset or the beauty of the waves in the ocean or the beauty
[2:39:19.020 --> 2:39:23.380]  of your life, your husband or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty
[2:39:23.380 --> 2:39:24.380]  of music.
[2:39:24.380 --> 2:39:29.180]  The fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic and that itself
[2:39:29.180 --> 2:39:32.540]  is what God teaches us is worship.
[2:39:32.540 --> 2:39:36.620]  So don't worship the globalist, don't worship the NFL, don't worship all the things of
[2:39:36.620 --> 2:39:42.500]  the system but worship the things of God because we're made by God and appreciate your consciousness
[2:39:42.500 --> 2:39:49.220]  and appreciate free speech while you still have it, while you still have it.
[2:39:49.220 --> 2:40:00.180]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:40:00.180 --> 2:40:06.740]  Very powerful, the Awaking World Truths Summit, Alex Jones speaking, we are going to air
[2:40:06.740 --> 2:40:11.860]  more of that but you know, it's incredible, you're talking about the New World Order takeover,
[2:40:11.860 --> 2:40:17.900]  planetary government, basically all the stuff that you've seen from COVID will be permanent.
[2:40:17.900 --> 2:40:20.420]  The world government will decide when you can leave your house, if you can leave your
[2:40:20.420 --> 2:40:23.820]  house, if you can go to work, if you can go to church, they'll cancel church actually,
[2:40:23.820 --> 2:40:27.460]  there won't be any churches, right, if you can go to school which will just be indoctrination
[2:40:27.460 --> 2:40:28.460]  centers.
[2:40:28.460 --> 2:40:31.140]  If you can take off a face mask, you'll be forced to take vaccines.
[2:40:31.140 --> 2:40:34.660]  So this is all coming, this is a global plan, this is how the New World Order is going to
[2:40:34.660 --> 2:40:39.060]  bring in the global government, that's their ultimate goal here.
[2:40:39.060 --> 2:40:44.780]  And the Democrat Party is the front lines and many Republicans too, I mean you saw Greg
[2:40:44.780 --> 2:40:50.700]  Abbott, flies an Israeli flag in his office, says he's going to cancel Gab in Texas but
[2:40:50.700 --> 2:40:57.300]  he's against censorship as he's censoring people so he's a total fraud and he'll cave
[2:40:57.300 --> 2:41:00.660]  on the mass mandate, he'll probably bring the mass mandate back and if they pass Texas
[2:41:00.660 --> 2:41:04.060]  bill HB3, we're done.
[2:41:04.060 --> 2:41:09.900]  And so you know, I would just have this to say to the Democrats, is there any way, seriously
[2:41:09.900 --> 2:41:14.860]  this is just what I would say to the Democrats and the liberals right now, let's say we'll
[2:41:14.860 --> 2:41:19.660]  wave the white flag, we'll give you guys America, you conquered us, you're enslaving us, you
[2:41:19.660 --> 2:41:22.700]  killed our economy, you're taking away our freedoms, all right, it's fine, we wave the
[2:41:22.700 --> 2:41:28.340]  white flag, we give up, you win, America's bad, everyone in America will be a racist
[2:41:28.340 --> 2:41:32.980]  bigot, slave and you can take all the guns and censor all the free speech and burn all
[2:41:32.980 --> 2:41:37.140]  the books you don't like and so fine, you did it, you won, you ended freedom, congratulations.
[2:41:37.140 --> 2:41:39.300]  Is there anywhere we can go and be free?
[2:41:39.300 --> 2:41:41.580]  Will you give us any place to go be free?
[2:41:41.580 --> 2:41:45.880]  Will you give us any place to have a last bastion of freedom, a last holdout to live
[2:41:45.880 --> 2:41:48.980]  our lives, how we see fit without you trying to dominate us?
[2:41:48.980 --> 2:41:59.220]  Is there anywhere, no, because you're totalitarians and you're hell bent on forcing your way of
[2:41:59.220 --> 2:42:06.740]  life on the rest of us and it's sick, it's demonic and Joe Biden just signed the $2 trillion
[2:42:06.740 --> 2:42:12.980]  stimulus bill, they're claiming it's a rescue plan and it's going to end America's poverty,
[2:42:12.980 --> 2:42:18.940]  what a lie, you'll never see, most people will never see their stimulus check, 1.5 trillion
[2:42:18.940 --> 2:42:23.260]  of this won't have anything to do with COVID, we'll even be going to foreign nations and
[2:42:23.260 --> 2:42:29.660]  by the way, after Biden signed it, he invited the media in to watch him sign it, after he
[2:42:29.660 --> 2:42:33.340]  signed it, they kicked the media out, no questions asked.
[2:42:33.340 --> 2:42:39.180]  This is an evil demonic takeover of the entire planet and the Democrats will give us no quarter
[2:42:39.180 --> 2:42:47.860]  for human freedom, zero, recognize this, approach the world with this understanding if you want
[2:42:47.860 --> 2:42:50.500]  to ever live free on this planet or in this country again.
[2:42:50.500 --> 2:42:55.140]  Now back to Alex Jones at the Awakening World True Summit.
[2:42:55.140 --> 2:43:02.380]  Talk about the founding fabrics of what now we've seen, the evolution and how these processes
[2:43:02.380 --> 2:43:10.900]  have been contemporized, it's very, very dippinous in that late 90s, we had in Canada something
[2:43:10.900 --> 2:43:18.380]  similar to what has been in US media over the last couple of years and that was China,
[2:43:18.380 --> 2:43:24.220]  1,000 talents and when we talk about the 1,000 talents, we talk about the recruitment of
[2:43:24.220 --> 2:43:32.100]  the brightest and the best minds, science, throughout education, I know that the Department
[2:43:32.100 --> 2:43:36.780]  of Justice, there was an article I want to think that came out in November that they
[2:43:36.780 --> 2:43:45.300]  found over a billion dollars that were funneled through and contributed to educational institutions.
[2:43:45.300 --> 2:43:49.020]  That's the Confucius Institutes, Confucius Institutes, exactly.
[2:43:49.020 --> 2:43:54.220]  China taking over British, German, Australian, Canadian, US, Mexican, they're the biggest
[2:43:54.220 --> 2:43:58.780]  and globalist through China, just like the globalist created Hitler, the globalist created
[2:43:58.780 --> 2:43:59.780]  communist China.
[2:43:59.780 --> 2:44:04.220]  So it's not the Germans, it's not the Chinese people, they get a good powerful group of smart,
[2:44:04.220 --> 2:44:08.140]  they enslave them, they hype them up and then they use them and I believe China will actually
[2:44:08.140 --> 2:44:11.100]  get destroyed in the end in the setup.
[2:44:11.100 --> 2:44:15.700]  But I didn't interrupt you where you were going, sir, you're 100% on target.
[2:44:15.700 --> 2:44:20.700]  Yeah, no, but it's really curious because again, I said that when we spoke, when we
[2:44:20.700 --> 2:44:26.500]  get the opportunity to speak with you, that your vantage point, that your support, your
[2:44:26.500 --> 2:44:33.620]  support, just your understanding, your knowledge base is tremendous and so for our viewers,
[2:44:33.620 --> 2:44:39.700]  the first that they have and the reason why part one of the Awakening had 1.1 million
[2:44:39.700 --> 2:44:45.140]  views is because people aren't getting what they need.
[2:44:45.140 --> 2:44:52.780]  We talk about the sustenance from the news, the mainstream news media, a lot of questions
[2:44:52.780 --> 2:44:53.780]  still to be answered.
[2:44:53.780 --> 2:45:00.820]  We know that the purple elephant with pink polka dots in the room is COVID, but COVID
[2:45:00.820 --> 2:45:01.820]  is the byproduct.
[2:45:01.820 --> 2:45:07.780]  So it is very curious and the dialogue that we like to foster is, okay, we know what it
[2:45:07.780 --> 2:45:08.780]  is.
[2:45:08.780 --> 2:45:09.780]  We know what's happening.
[2:45:09.780 --> 2:45:15.260]  We have exhibited and expressed our concerns, but how did we get here?
[2:45:15.260 --> 2:45:20.460]  If these are the leaves or this is the branch of the present day circumstance, the detrunk
[2:45:20.460 --> 2:45:24.740]  in the root of the issue comes from where?
[2:45:24.740 --> 2:45:29.240]  And again, with the belief system that if we have a broader understanding, a more extensive
[2:45:29.240 --> 2:45:35.420]  understanding, then we'll know collectively how to move forward to addressing it.
[2:45:35.420 --> 2:45:41.300]  And so obviously, I've been doing that for 27 years.
[2:45:41.300 --> 2:45:45.580]  And again, for me, it was just a learning process from studying history and a lot of
[2:45:45.580 --> 2:45:48.580]  books around the house that my parents were reading, they never pushed any of this on
[2:45:48.580 --> 2:45:49.580]  me.
[2:45:49.580 --> 2:45:50.580]  They never even really told me any of this.
[2:45:50.580 --> 2:45:55.100]  I just kind of discovered it on my own and then found out that my dad had gotten sucked
[2:45:55.100 --> 2:46:00.820]  into it because it's on such an industrialized scale, and what people need to know is this.
[2:46:00.820 --> 2:46:07.780]  The history of this goes back to Plato 2,300 years ago in Greece, and Greece had over a
[2:46:07.780 --> 2:46:08.780]  dozen city-states.
[2:46:08.780 --> 2:46:14.540]  So one was a democracy, one was Spartan, one was this, one was that, Alexander the Great
[2:46:14.540 --> 2:46:17.820]  and people came from up north of there, from Macedonia.
[2:46:17.820 --> 2:46:23.500]  So it was all these different forms of government, but the system that Plato came up with was
[2:46:23.500 --> 2:46:28.580]  a republic, but not the republic, we even kind of think about it, was a republic run
[2:46:28.580 --> 2:46:29.580]  by an elite.
[2:46:29.580 --> 2:46:34.460]  And he looked at his fellow Greeks and said, we should just get rid of poor people.
[2:46:34.460 --> 2:46:38.860]  And he said they're crushing the breast of Mother Earth and all this.
[2:46:38.860 --> 2:46:44.580]  And so you follow him, a lot of kings, a lot of royalty, every culture, it doesn't matter
[2:46:44.580 --> 2:46:47.740]  where you are in the world, elites have an idea that they're the elite, and the general
[2:46:47.740 --> 2:46:49.900]  public can be expendable.
[2:46:49.900 --> 2:46:55.300]  But by Malthus 300 years ago in England, he was the guy, Malthusianism, says let's just
[2:46:55.300 --> 2:47:01.020]  herd poor people into compact cities and then give them diseased blankets and things to
[2:47:01.020 --> 2:47:02.020]  kill them.
[2:47:02.020 --> 2:47:06.020]  He wanted to kill the Brits, the Irish, the Scots, I mean, the royalty saw these big cities
[2:47:06.020 --> 2:47:09.700]  and saw these big populations as a threat.
[2:47:09.700 --> 2:47:15.020]  And they were worried about a peasant uprising, okay, and so if they couldn't kill them all,
[2:47:15.020 --> 2:47:19.300]  they would ship them to Australia or ship them to the United States on slave ships.
[2:47:19.300 --> 2:47:21.500]  And so, you know, penal colonies.
[2:47:21.500 --> 2:47:22.980]  And so that's where this comes from.
[2:47:22.980 --> 2:47:30.300]  And then the robber barons about 160 years ago in the UK and in the United States, J.P.
[2:47:30.300 --> 2:47:35.060]  Morgan, all of them literally were called social Darwinists, and they said survival
[2:47:35.060 --> 2:47:38.460]  of the fittest, we have a right to kill and murder whoever we want because we're the
[2:47:38.460 --> 2:47:39.460]  elites.
[2:47:39.460 --> 2:47:44.460]  So the theory of evolution from Charles Darwin was picked up by them, and then they called
[2:47:44.460 --> 2:47:45.660]  it social Darwinism.
[2:47:45.660 --> 2:47:53.220]  And so by 1860, they launched the social Darwin system and picked up modern eugenics.
[2:47:53.220 --> 2:47:59.780]  The term eugenics got coined by Francis Galton, who again, they did a breeding program with
[2:47:59.780 --> 2:48:03.260]  the Wedgewoods, Huxleys, the Galton's, and others.
[2:48:03.260 --> 2:48:07.300]  The Blair's were involved, and they were trying to create supermen to prove this theory.
[2:48:07.300 --> 2:48:10.540]  They actually created psychos and mentally retarded people.
[2:48:10.540 --> 2:48:11.540]  It was very, very sad.
[2:48:11.540 --> 2:48:16.580]  But it did produce Aldous Huxley and Julian Huxley, who then one went on to write Brave
[2:48:16.580 --> 2:48:20.940]  New World, the other went on to basically create transhumanism in the UN.
[2:48:20.940 --> 2:48:24.660]  And they wrote nonfiction books about everything we're now living under, and how they would
[2:48:24.660 --> 2:48:28.420]  make biological sex impossible, like we'll be French bulldogs, won't be able to have
[2:48:28.420 --> 2:48:29.420]  children.
[2:48:29.420 --> 2:48:31.780]  We'll have to go have it genetically engineered.
[2:48:31.780 --> 2:48:35.740]  And now even the New York Times had the headline last week, the problem with the sperm, and
[2:48:35.740 --> 2:48:41.100]  they admit the chemicals that are purposely put in the water are actually sterilizing mainly
[2:48:41.100 --> 2:48:42.620]  the male population.
[2:48:42.620 --> 2:48:46.260]  And so again, there's just thousands of data points in all of this, but here's why they're
[2:48:46.260 --> 2:48:47.260]  doing it.
[2:48:47.260 --> 2:48:49.260]  They have a will to nominate.
[2:48:49.260 --> 2:48:54.700]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, the full video, of course, the Awakening World Truth
[2:48:54.700 --> 2:48:57.420]  Summit, TCN video, the host there.
[2:48:57.420 --> 2:49:00.140]  We have it at band.video as well.
[2:49:00.140 --> 2:49:04.500]  The entire Alex Jones portion is available at band.video.
[2:49:04.500 --> 2:49:06.100]  You can download that, share that there.
[2:49:06.100 --> 2:49:09.900]  And of course, these are the platforms we have to build because we're the most censored
[2:49:09.900 --> 2:49:14.500]  name in news because we're the most hardcore name in news and I mean, imagine if you're
[2:49:14.500 --> 2:49:21.540]  in a war and your enemy has your battle plans and your enemy is publishing the battle plans
[2:49:21.540 --> 2:49:22.540]  to the public.
[2:49:22.540 --> 2:49:23.540]  Well, what are you going to do?
[2:49:23.540 --> 2:49:24.860]  You're going to make sure that they don't have publishing power.
[2:49:24.860 --> 2:49:27.820]  You're going to try to shut them down to keep their battle plans from being exposed.
[2:49:27.820 --> 2:49:29.340]  Well, that's info wars.
[2:49:29.340 --> 2:49:35.420]  We're exposing the enemy battle plans from the low level Democrats operating it to the
[2:49:35.420 --> 2:49:40.420]  high levels of the Bill Gates and the Klaus Schwab's and the UN.
[2:49:40.420 --> 2:49:43.140]  We're telling you their battle plan.
[2:49:43.140 --> 2:49:46.740]  That's why we're bonafide now as next year's news today.
[2:49:46.740 --> 2:49:52.780]  Nobody else holds a candle to what info wars does and everybody knows it.
[2:49:52.780 --> 2:49:56.540]  So it's only possible though, when you shop at infowarstore.com, the good news is we make
[2:49:56.540 --> 2:50:01.860]  it easy on you with very popular products like vitamin mineral fusion, which is now

[2:50:14.900 --> 2:50:18.540]  So take advantage of that before that deal is all said and done.
[2:50:18.540 --> 2:50:22.180]  And of course, all the other great supplements, the hats, the t-shirts, the books, the DVDs,

[2:50:23.180 --> 2:50:24.180]  All right.
[2:50:24.180 --> 2:50:27.300]  I'm signing off the Alex Jones show, Jay Dyer hosting the fourth hour.
[2:50:27.300 --> 2:50:32.100]  I'll be back hosting a war room, taking your calls, breaking news from three to six p.m.
[2:50:32.100 --> 2:50:35.020]  on the war room, Jay Dyer, up now.
[2:50:35.020 --> 2:50:38.740]  Listers ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[2:50:38.740 --> 2:50:41.380]  Why do you have multiple high quality iodine?
[2:50:41.380 --> 2:50:42.380]  Why do you do that?
[2:50:42.380 --> 2:50:44.660]  Because different strokes for different folks.
[2:50:44.660 --> 2:50:48.980]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say, hey, a lot of people love deep
[2:50:48.980 --> 2:50:53.020]  earth pure crystal iodine, but you should put one out with deeper crystal iodine and
[2:50:53.020 --> 2:50:56.220]  the two other types because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[2:50:56.220 --> 2:50:57.220]  Boom.
[2:50:57.220 --> 2:50:58.220]  We did it.
[2:50:58.220 --> 2:50:59.220]  It's popular.
[2:50:59.220 --> 2:51:00.220]  It's X3.
[2:51:00.220 --> 2:51:01.220]  Is it better than X2?
[2:51:01.220 --> 2:51:02.220]  You decide.
[2:51:02.220 --> 2:51:03.220]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[2:51:03.220 --> 2:51:07.740]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular powdered pill sleeping.
[2:51:07.740 --> 2:51:09.140]  And that is down and out.
[2:51:09.140 --> 2:51:14.060]  It's super strong, way stronger than knock out, but they don't compete with each other.
[2:51:14.060 --> 2:51:16.540]  Different strokes for different folks, different formulas.
[2:51:16.540 --> 2:51:21.260]  And it's 40% off out of the gates at infowarstore.com and free shipping.
[2:51:21.260 --> 2:51:22.260]  Secure your down and out today.
[2:51:22.260 --> 2:51:25.500]  And while you're sleeping, you know you're funding the info at the same time.
[2:51:25.500 --> 2:51:36.380]  Down and out exclusively available at infowarstore.com or 40% off and for shipping.
[2:51:36.380 --> 2:51:39.740]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[2:51:39.740 --> 2:51:44.060]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[2:51:44.060 --> 2:51:48.780]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them
[2:51:48.780 --> 2:51:53.300]  a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarstore.com.
[2:51:53.300 --> 2:51:58.100]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower
[2:51:58.100 --> 2:52:03.820]  blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide
[2:52:03.820 --> 2:52:09.820]  a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[2:52:09.820 --> 2:52:16.460]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[2:52:16.460 --> 2:52:21.060]  by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[2:52:21.060 --> 2:52:26.940]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual
[2:52:26.940 --> 2:52:29.620]  facts that pertain to reality.
[2:52:29.620 --> 2:52:39.100]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at infowarstore.com.
[2:52:39.100 --> 2:52:57.860]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:52:57.860 --> 2:53:00.860]  Welcome back to the College of Noguko.
[2:53:00.860 --> 2:53:08.660]  I'm your guest, Glenn Hose, today I want to talk about the history of organized crime
[2:53:08.660 --> 2:53:14.900]  in the United States and everybody knows from pop culture the countless gangster films,
[2:53:14.900 --> 2:53:21.780]  the countless godfathers, sopranos, good fellows, all of which are great works of art,
[2:53:21.780 --> 2:53:27.380]  but the interesting thing here is that the history of organized crime in the U.S. actually
[2:53:27.380 --> 2:53:35.220]  gives us a perfect window into the elite criminality of the global power structure.
[2:53:35.220 --> 2:53:42.020]  The New World Order pretty much has the same structure, the same modus operandi as the
[2:53:42.020 --> 2:53:45.420]  Sicilian mafia had in the 20th century in the United States.
[2:53:45.420 --> 2:53:49.660]  Now I'm not saying that the Sicilian mafia runs the New World Order, I'm not saying that
[2:53:49.660 --> 2:53:50.660]  at all.
[2:53:50.660 --> 2:53:56.500]  I'm just saying that the history of organized crime is a fascinating intricate tie-in between
[2:53:56.500 --> 2:54:03.940]  intelligence agencies, criminal elements, the government senators, right, and it even touches
[2:54:03.940 --> 2:54:04.940]  on JFK.
[2:54:04.940 --> 2:54:12.020]  Now I'm not a big JFK historian kind of guy, I obviously don't believe the true, the mainstream
[2:54:12.020 --> 2:54:18.700]  narrative of JFK, but not intending to get into JFK stuff by researching the history
[2:54:18.700 --> 2:54:24.020]  of the five families, the mafia in the U.S. It actually did bring me right into the domain
[2:54:24.020 --> 2:54:29.820]  of potentially one of the key angles in deciphering what happened with JFK.
[2:54:29.820 --> 2:54:33.660]  So we'll get to that in a moment, but one thing that a lot of people don't know is that
[2:54:33.660 --> 2:54:40.900]  if you look at the history of the mafia or the Kosanostra to be specific, they had a
[2:54:40.900 --> 2:54:47.540]  specific oath, a ritual, right, and this oath ritual that I'm sure people have seen in movies
[2:54:47.540 --> 2:54:53.180]  like Goodfellows or in movies or shows like The Sopranos, right, it involves this death
[2:54:53.180 --> 2:54:59.260]  oath where you take a ritual oath to die if you divulge any of the secrets, right, this
[2:54:59.260 --> 2:55:01.260]  is known as the omerta.
[2:55:01.260 --> 2:55:06.420]  And what's fascinating is that the history of the omerta itself has similarities to freemasonic
[2:55:06.420 --> 2:55:08.540]  initiation ritual oaths.
[2:55:08.540 --> 2:55:13.540]  And the reason for that I discovered was that if you go back to the history of the mafia
[2:55:13.540 --> 2:55:18.180]  in Sicily, they at one time were actually patriots.
[2:55:18.180 --> 2:55:22.940]  So if you go back maybe even to the middle ages, the maviosi were the sort of libertarian
[2:55:22.940 --> 2:55:28.940]  local militia, the patriots who would protect, right, any kind of legitimate protection racket,
[2:55:28.940 --> 2:55:35.780]  so to speak, the local citizens in Sicily from outside invaders, Sicily was constantly
[2:55:35.780 --> 2:55:39.540]  invaded by all kinds of different outside forces.
[2:55:39.540 --> 2:55:42.380]  So we can see the logic of why they did what they did.
[2:55:42.380 --> 2:55:47.380]  But the problem with this is that over time, the local chieftains got to be pretty corrupt.
[2:55:47.380 --> 2:55:55.020]  The bosses, so to speak, became more like brigands and thieves, common hooligans, purveyors
[2:55:55.020 --> 2:55:58.140]  of ladies of the evening, lucies, et cetera.
[2:55:58.140 --> 2:55:59.820]  And so things got bad, right?
[2:55:59.820 --> 2:56:06.340]  And so what happens then is in the Italian Revolution or the attempt to reunite Italy
[2:56:06.340 --> 2:56:13.340]  under Garibaldi, Garibaldi just happened to be supremely influenced by a certain guy
[2:56:13.340 --> 2:56:17.700]  that you may or may not know named Giuseppe Mazzini.
[2:56:17.700 --> 2:56:23.300]  And if you know history, Giuseppe Mazzini is kind of the Albert Pike of his time, right?
[2:56:23.300 --> 2:56:26.860]  He's the, or the, you could say the Albert Pike of Italy, right?
[2:56:26.860 --> 2:56:30.460]  He was the chief illuminist of that time period.
[2:56:30.460 --> 2:56:35.460]  And so his Masonic philosophy influenced Garibaldi tremendously.
[2:56:35.460 --> 2:56:41.700]  And so this is where we get the tendency of the maviosi who were recruited by Garibaldi
[2:56:41.700 --> 2:56:46.660]  as his soldiers, right, to have these oaths, right, these Masonic blood oaths.
[2:56:46.660 --> 2:56:49.940]  So that's the origin of why there's this omerta.
[2:56:49.940 --> 2:56:53.580]  And then when we get to the U.S., right, we have the immigrants coming over in different
[2:56:53.580 --> 2:56:59.100]  waves and in different time periods, who then, as you could imagine, naturally have to set
[2:56:59.100 --> 2:57:01.780]  up their own operations to make money.
[2:57:01.780 --> 2:57:06.300]  If you're a poor immigrant, obviously, organized crime is one of the easiest pathways into
[2:57:06.300 --> 2:57:07.940]  trying to make a living.
[2:57:07.940 --> 2:57:12.500]  And this will lead us into a lot of really fascinating connections to the intelligence
[2:57:12.500 --> 2:57:16.700]  agencies, to corrupt members of the state.
[2:57:16.700 --> 2:57:22.820]  And ultimately, as I said, to JFK, and that will tell us the deep state power structure,
[2:57:22.820 --> 2:57:28.060]  the shadow government, the same model that the mafia has, is the same model that the
[2:57:28.060 --> 2:57:32.460]  intelligence agencies and our shadow government have, even still to this day, many of the
[2:57:32.460 --> 2:57:35.700]  same players and power structure being involved.
[2:57:35.700 --> 2:57:39.300]  So when we come back from break, I will get deeper into that and see how it's going to
[2:57:39.300 --> 2:57:40.300]  change.
[2:57:40.300 --> 2:57:49.180]  I've been thinking a lot lately about playing devil's advocate on there, about looking at
[2:57:49.180 --> 2:57:53.220]  the world from the perspective of the globalists, that the public's so dumbed down that they
[2:57:53.220 --> 2:57:56.420]  don't care that we're stealing their future from them, that we're poisoning them, that
[2:57:56.420 --> 2:57:59.620]  we're sterilizing them, that they deserve to be killed.
[2:57:59.620 --> 2:58:02.100]  Yes, that's the position of the globalists.
[2:58:02.100 --> 2:58:03.100]  They play God.
[2:58:03.100 --> 2:58:07.060]  And they think because we don't stand up, they have a right to do this to us.
[2:58:07.060 --> 2:58:10.580]  And I've told you that the globalists have tried to harm me.
[2:58:10.580 --> 2:58:12.100]  They've tried to get me to join them.
[2:58:12.100 --> 2:58:16.300]  But metaphysically, at a spiritual level, I have the Holy Spirit.
[2:58:16.300 --> 2:58:17.300]  I'm finishing God's.
[2:58:17.300 --> 2:58:21.500]  And I know that God does not like to expect me to not join the enemy.
[2:58:21.500 --> 2:58:25.980]  But I'll tell you, at a selfish level, I get very, very mad at people that go along with
[2:58:25.980 --> 2:58:30.380]  the system, believing you're part of it or believing you're getting power out of it.
[2:58:30.380 --> 2:58:36.180]  Whether you're just a steelworker or a schoolteacher or a Henry Kissinger, you're not God.
[2:58:36.180 --> 2:58:40.740]  And treating other people like they're animals and you're God is something that the real
[2:58:40.740 --> 2:58:54.700]  God of the universe doesn't like, and that's a fact.
[2:58:54.700 --> 2:58:59.540]  Welcome back.
[2:58:59.540 --> 2:59:06.540]  As you know, I publish field politics, philosophy, film, religion, all kinds of wild intricate
[2:59:06.540 --> 2:59:08.980]  topics and how they all interrelate at a meta level.
[2:59:08.980 --> 2:59:13.260]  And today, we're looking at the history of organized crime in the U.S., particularly
[2:59:13.260 --> 2:59:19.260]  the five families and the Sicilian mafia, to get an insight, a window into how the global
[2:59:19.260 --> 2:59:21.620]  power structure itself works.
[2:59:21.620 --> 2:59:26.420]  Again, the same model, as I was saying, is out of the Sicilian mafia.
[2:59:26.420 --> 2:59:31.340]  And if you know history, you know that the Sicilian mafia structured itself on the Roman
[2:59:31.340 --> 2:59:32.340]  model.
[2:59:32.340 --> 2:59:33.340]  Right?
[2:59:33.340 --> 2:59:38.700]  So the way that the Roman squadrons had the company commander and they had the soldiers,
[2:59:38.700 --> 2:59:39.700]  right?
[2:59:39.700 --> 2:59:43.740]  Sicilian mafia has the same structure where they borrowed this and they put, right, the
[2:59:43.740 --> 2:59:48.820]  soldiers, the foot soldiers, then they have a layer above them, right, which are the bosses,
[2:59:48.820 --> 2:59:51.620]  and then you have the dawn, which is the head of that family.
[2:59:51.620 --> 2:59:56.780]  And then Lucky Luciano, right, in the middle of the 20th century, organizes the commission,
[2:59:56.780 --> 3:00:01.220]  as it's called, which is the structure of all the heads of the families coming to meet,
[3:00:01.220 --> 3:00:04.140]  right, at different times and make decisions.
[3:00:04.140 --> 3:00:07.940]  And this commission would then be the kind of the dominant power structure for several
[3:00:07.940 --> 3:00:14.020]  decades and would allow the Sicilian mafia, at least in some cases, in the case of Carlo
[3:00:14.020 --> 3:00:20.580]  Gambino, to become the wealthiest, most powerful man in New York back in the 50s and 60s.
[3:00:20.580 --> 3:00:24.740]  So I'm not saying, again, the point is not that the Sicilian mafia runs the world.
[3:00:24.740 --> 3:00:30.100]  It's rather that this structure, right, the cells and the way that the mob is structured
[3:00:30.100 --> 3:00:36.980]  and the way that they form a parallel government within society is exactly the way the elite
[3:00:36.980 --> 3:00:40.740]  structure, the New World Order, right, the shadow government, the parallel government
[3:00:40.740 --> 3:00:45.020]  that runs counter to and within our own government.
[3:00:45.020 --> 3:00:52.100]  And what we want to look at next is the rise of how these groups got into black markets.
[3:00:52.100 --> 3:00:56.100]  So the mob event, initially, you might not know this, but you might think, oh, they
[3:00:56.100 --> 3:00:57.100]  came to New York.
[3:00:57.100 --> 3:01:03.580]  Now, actually, the mafia originally set up in New Orleans, and the first boss that
[3:01:03.580 --> 3:01:08.260]  became really famous in the 20th century in New Orleans, the governor of Carlos Marcello.
[3:01:08.260 --> 3:01:10.700]  So keep Marcello in mind because he's going to be very important.
[3:01:10.700 --> 3:01:15.460]  In fact, believe it or not, at one time, Bill O'Reilly used to cover this material.
[3:01:15.460 --> 3:01:19.940]  He was like a almost Alex Jones kind of figure at one time back in the 90s, and he actually
[3:01:19.940 --> 3:01:27.100]  did a whole expose on the JFK trial and on the character of Carlos Marcello Santos Traficante,
[3:01:27.100 --> 3:01:33.100]  right, these different figures that had a direct connection to the JFK assassination.
[3:01:33.100 --> 3:01:36.500]  Before we get to that, what we want to point out is that so black markets become a key
[3:01:36.500 --> 3:01:42.460]  means of the elite, excuse me, of organized crime and controlling cities.
[3:01:42.460 --> 3:01:47.940]  So controlling unions would allow the organized crime networks to control the harbors, right,
[3:01:47.940 --> 3:01:49.820]  it would control logistics throughout the city.
[3:01:49.820 --> 3:01:52.060]  That becomes very important for trafficking drugs.
[3:01:52.060 --> 3:01:59.700]  And I think by the 50s, if I'm correct, Sicilian mafia was responsible for 90% of heroin importation.
[3:01:59.700 --> 3:02:04.900]  And they had a really elaborate network set up from bringing people from Sicily over to
[3:02:04.900 --> 3:02:10.340]  run the heroin trade here and sending people from here, born here, over to Sicily to run
[3:02:10.340 --> 3:02:11.340]  it there.
[3:02:11.340 --> 3:02:13.780]  That way the cops didn't have any records of anybody, which was kind of an ingenious
[3:02:13.780 --> 3:02:14.780]  plot, right.
[3:02:14.780 --> 3:02:21.580]  And that was all organized by Lucky Luciano, he set all that up, Don Vito Genovesi as well.
[3:02:21.580 --> 3:02:27.940]  By the way, both of those characters had intimate relationships with the Navy in the case of
[3:02:27.940 --> 3:02:34.700]  Don Vito Genovesi, and in the case of Lucky Luciano, there are as well as Santos Traficante,
[3:02:34.700 --> 3:02:41.860]  as well as Sam Giancana, the head of the Chicago mafia, as well as Hitman John Rosselli, all
[3:02:41.860 --> 3:02:45.260]  with intelligence connections, connections to the CIA.
[3:02:45.260 --> 3:02:52.700]  In fact, it's believed that CIA operative Robert Mayhew is who paid Santos Traficante
[3:02:52.700 --> 3:02:57.900]  $150,000 to try to organize the assassination of the Del Castro.
[3:02:57.900 --> 3:03:02.220]  That is one of eight different incidents where the CIA was involved in trying to arrange
[3:03:02.220 --> 3:03:03.700]  foreign assassinations.
[3:03:03.700 --> 3:03:09.260]  Now, the point is not so much to focus on Castro there, but to point out that, well,
[3:03:09.260 --> 3:03:13.500]  if they can arrange that kind of a thing, maybe we can see a commonality of interest
[3:03:13.500 --> 3:03:16.460]  in wanting to get rid of JFK and RFK.
[3:03:16.460 --> 3:03:18.940]  I'm not a big, huge fan of JFK, per se.
[3:03:18.940 --> 3:03:19.940]  I'm not a Democrat.
[3:03:19.940 --> 3:03:24.460]  I'm not a champion of anything relating to his policies, per se.
[3:03:24.460 --> 3:03:27.340]  I'm just looking at where the information leads, right.
[3:03:27.340 --> 3:03:32.540]  I'm not interested in trying to defend him as some sort of hero, per se, because if you
[3:03:32.540 --> 3:03:38.780]  look at it in the case of, say, Marilyn Monroe, there's some really bizarre love trists and
[3:03:38.780 --> 3:03:45.300]  perhaps even mind control going on with Frank Sinatra, Sam Giancana, and JFK all sleeping
[3:03:45.300 --> 3:03:46.380]  with the same girl.
[3:03:46.380 --> 3:03:49.300]  She ends up dead under suspicious circumstances.
[3:03:49.300 --> 3:03:55.620]  She herself has a Department of Defense identification badge, so she was probably doing intelligence
[3:03:55.620 --> 3:03:57.540]  operative work as well.
[3:03:57.540 --> 3:04:04.180]  We know that from her ability to enter into the Laurel Canyon Air Force studios without
[3:04:04.180 --> 3:04:07.980]  any problem, as well as a lot of the other Hollywood elite.
[3:04:07.980 --> 3:04:09.100]  And this is not unheard of, right.
[3:04:09.100 --> 3:04:14.620]  At that time, a lot of the power structure could do multiple things, right.
[3:04:14.620 --> 3:04:19.780]  You could be an A-list actor and you could be an informant for the FBI, like Jimmy Stewart,
[3:04:19.780 --> 3:04:25.540]  or you could be a spy for the OSS, like I believe Kerry Grant was for some time.
[3:04:25.540 --> 3:04:27.540]  So this is not unheard of, right.
[3:04:27.540 --> 3:04:32.020]  And obviously then this mob angle is very important, especially during these decades
[3:04:32.020 --> 3:04:34.780]  of the 40s, 50s, 60s, and 70s.
[3:04:34.780 --> 3:04:38.940]  After that, of course, the civilian mafia seems to wane in a lot of their power and
[3:04:38.940 --> 3:04:44.260]  that's due to a lot of the media attention that the different hearings would give as
[3:04:44.260 --> 3:04:50.060]  well as figures like John Gotti who wanted to have a lot of media attention.
[3:04:50.060 --> 3:04:53.780]  This began to be very detrimental to their businesses.
[3:04:53.780 --> 3:04:58.540]  But before we get to that, let's talk about the figure of Sam Giancana, who is the head
[3:04:58.540 --> 3:05:02.780]  of the Chicago Mafia, the Chicago Mafia known as the Outfit.
[3:05:02.780 --> 3:05:06.780]  After Al Capone's period, who actually wasn't that powerful of a character, although he
[3:05:06.780 --> 3:05:11.620]  did bootleg with Joseph Kennedy Sr.
[3:05:11.620 --> 3:05:15.700]  So there's an interesting parallel between Al Capone and Joe Kennedy Sr.
[3:05:15.700 --> 3:05:19.580]  If you go take the gangster tour down in Hot Springs, Arkansas, they'll tell you all these
[3:05:19.580 --> 3:05:20.580]  details.
[3:05:20.580 --> 3:05:28.580]  Anyway, by the way, JFK Sr. would call upon the mafia and Sam Giancana to help get Joe
[3:05:28.580 --> 3:05:29.780]  Kennedy elected.
[3:05:29.780 --> 3:05:36.700]  And so this becomes a partnership that will most likely be a big factor in why JFK and
[3:05:36.700 --> 3:05:39.940]  RFK end up meeting their demise, right?
[3:05:39.940 --> 3:05:46.260]  So the assumption was that if we help get you elected, maybe you'll go easy on us, right?
[3:05:46.260 --> 3:05:52.220]  And so Sam Giancana was one of the most powerful figures in the U.S., especially in terms of
[3:05:52.220 --> 3:05:56.260]  the criminal syndicates at that time.
[3:05:56.260 --> 3:06:04.340]  He does, through the Democratic machine, vote fixing ballot stuffing.
[3:06:04.340 --> 3:06:09.820]  Maybe we've heard of this before, the Democratic machine in the big cities is able to help
[3:06:09.820 --> 3:06:10.820]  certain people get elected.
[3:06:10.820 --> 3:06:15.580]  I think you may have heard of this before, perhaps recently, I don't know.
[3:06:15.580 --> 3:06:19.620]  When they get JFK installed, especially in that razor thin election, right, if you recall
[3:06:19.620 --> 3:06:24.500]  that famous incident, well, so JFK comes in and does he go easy on organized crime?
[3:06:24.500 --> 3:06:25.500]  No, he doesn't.
[3:06:25.500 --> 3:06:31.460]  In fact, he appoints his brother, RFK, to prosecute the mafia.
[3:06:31.460 --> 3:06:36.300]  So you can easily see that, right, this sort of double cross here will get you elected
[3:06:36.300 --> 3:06:40.980]  and they know he starts shining all of this light on, right, the mob figures.
[3:06:40.980 --> 3:06:48.900]  In fact, they call in even some of the big bosses, right, to do these televised investigations.
[3:06:48.900 --> 3:06:54.180]  Carlos Marcello is called in eventually to testify about the JFK assassination.
[3:06:54.180 --> 3:06:57.860]  And this is one of many series of big televised events.
[3:06:57.860 --> 3:07:02.180]  Previous to that, there was Thomas Dewey and there was Estes Kefauber, who put a lot of
[3:07:02.180 --> 3:07:05.220]  media spotlight on the mafia and the dons, famously.
[3:07:05.220 --> 3:07:10.940]  And this, the media attention is actually what would be a big factor in the mafia losing
[3:07:10.940 --> 3:07:13.060]  a lot of their power.
[3:07:13.060 --> 3:07:18.660]  Now it stands to reason that you can see very clearly why these figures who had a lot of
[3:07:18.660 --> 3:07:24.100]  rackets, a lot of operations going, right, everything from casinos to prostitution to
[3:07:24.100 --> 3:07:27.820]  drug running, to legitimate businesses as well, right.
[3:07:27.820 --> 3:07:33.340]  So these are billion-dollar businesses, right, in the 40s, 50s and 60s.
[3:07:33.340 --> 3:07:38.340]  And again, I'm not saying that they run everything, but this is a significant power base, right,
[3:07:38.340 --> 3:07:40.860]  taking billions of dollars on all these different operations.
[3:07:40.860 --> 3:07:46.780]  And to go after these entities, like RFK did, who, again, himself was connected to all these
[3:07:46.780 --> 3:07:52.100]  entities, just was asked, he was just asking for it, right.
[3:07:52.100 --> 3:07:57.460]  And so we have then a clear motivation on the part of figures like Sam Jankana, Carlos
[3:07:57.460 --> 3:08:00.180]  Marcello, to get rid of JFK.
[3:08:00.180 --> 3:08:06.620]  And in fact, there was a series of tapes that Hoover had, he had hours and hours and hours
[3:08:06.620 --> 3:08:11.340]  of these tapes of illegal surveillance that he had done on many of the mob members that
[3:08:11.340 --> 3:08:17.140]  he was trying to, holding a sort of blackmail power, that he withheld from the Warren Commission.
[3:08:17.140 --> 3:08:23.300]  And the entire reason that RFK and others called that later in 1970, I think, 79 Commission
[3:08:23.300 --> 3:08:28.180]  to reinvestigate the Warren Commission is because of all this information that Hoover
[3:08:28.180 --> 3:08:34.420]  had withheld about mob guys on tapes saying, we got to get rid of that JFK family, they
[3:08:34.420 --> 3:08:38.300]  got to F and die, somebody needs to kill those FUCKs, right.
[3:08:38.300 --> 3:08:41.300]  So this is on tape, but it's withheld.
[3:08:41.300 --> 3:08:45.620]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point, it's very bittersweet.
[3:08:45.620 --> 3:08:48.420]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[3:08:48.420 --> 3:08:51.220]  And now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that, I care about beating
[3:08:51.220 --> 3:08:52.220]  the new world border.
[3:08:52.220 --> 3:08:57.340]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[3:08:57.340 --> 3:09:00.580]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us, for a lot of reasons,
[3:09:00.580 --> 3:09:04.220]  I can't tell you what's going on, but let's just say this, we're going to see this through
[3:09:04.220 --> 3:09:05.220]  the end.
[3:09:05.220 --> 3:09:07.820]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.

[3:09:11.460 --> 3:09:14.020]  great products, plus they fund the operation.

[3:09:17.900 --> 3:09:19.220]  No, a lot of them don't.
[3:09:19.220 --> 3:09:23.860]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking
[3:09:23.860 --> 3:09:25.700]  up and looking for truth.
[3:09:25.700 --> 3:09:27.340]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[3:09:27.340 --> 3:09:30.740]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us from the air.
[3:09:30.740 --> 3:09:34.660]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word, download everything

[3:10:44.660 --> 3:11:05.220]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:11:05.220 --> 3:11:10.660]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show and your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[3:11:10.660 --> 3:11:16.500]  We're talking about the mob.
[3:11:16.500 --> 3:11:19.220]  We're talking about the history of the five families.
[3:11:19.220 --> 3:11:24.020]  We're talking about the structure of the shadow government being modeled in a very similar
[3:11:24.020 --> 3:11:28.060]  way to the to the mafia.
[3:11:28.060 --> 3:11:34.780]  And in the U.S., this was deeply connected to all of the different organized crime rackets.
[3:11:34.780 --> 3:11:40.140]  And what I was getting into was the situation with Sam Jankana and the outfit right was
[3:11:40.140 --> 3:11:45.620]  very closely connected to Hollywood.
[3:11:45.620 --> 3:11:50.860]  So you're going to get a bugsy seagull going west to represent the mafia out in Hollywood.
[3:11:50.860 --> 3:11:52.500]  He controls the studio unions.
[3:11:52.500 --> 3:11:59.820]  He controls a lot of the rackets out there and then decides even at some point who gets
[3:11:59.820 --> 3:12:01.740]  what role and what picture.
[3:12:01.740 --> 3:12:04.300]  This is actually the origin of Las Vegas.
[3:12:04.300 --> 3:12:10.180]  Meyer Lansky consults with bugsy seagull on behalf of the five families to come up with
[3:12:10.180 --> 3:12:16.140]  this utopia oasis in the desert to just have a legal area right of gambling.
[3:12:16.140 --> 3:12:20.940]  That's the entire origin of Las Vegas is the figure of bugsy seagull and the flamenco which
[3:12:20.940 --> 3:12:24.020]  originally is a failure.
[3:12:24.020 --> 3:12:28.820]  Bugsy asked for about $3 million from his fellow mafia partners.
[3:12:28.820 --> 3:12:34.020]  The outfit and the family send him, I think, $3 million, many of much of which is the
[3:12:34.020 --> 3:12:42.380]  people's pensions, so the pensions that are stored in these funds because the mob controls
[3:12:42.380 --> 3:12:43.380]  the unions.
[3:12:43.380 --> 3:12:47.340]  They have access to everybody's pensions and they invest it in these casinos.
[3:12:47.340 --> 3:12:52.900]  And of course, bugsy and his girlfriend end up not really producing any returns.
[3:12:52.900 --> 3:12:58.020]  And this ends famously in bugsy being offed in a shooting at his house, you know, I think
[3:12:58.020 --> 3:13:01.020]  a 50 room estate in LA, Hollywood.
[3:13:01.020 --> 3:13:08.300]  And his girlfriend, I think Virginia Wool, she disappears with several million dollars
[3:13:08.300 --> 3:13:09.300]  as well.
[3:13:09.300 --> 3:13:13.340]  And if bugsy had just waited around a little bit longer, he could have seen a tremendous
[3:13:13.340 --> 3:13:17.540]  return on his investment because eventually in a few decades, the flamenco and the other
[3:13:17.540 --> 3:13:20.980]  casinos end up bringing in billions and billions of billions of dollars.
[3:13:20.980 --> 3:13:25.580]  Now the point is just to say that there's a clear connection then you see between both
[3:13:25.580 --> 3:13:32.020]  Hollywood and the entire city of Las Vegas and the five families, this gives you a window
[3:13:32.020 --> 3:13:37.620]  into the power structure and all of this is detailed in a very excellent way in Martin
[3:13:37.620 --> 3:13:43.660]  Scorsese's movie Casino, which upon reflection, after looking into this really deeply, I actually
[3:13:43.660 --> 3:13:48.300]  have a much greater appreciation for Casino than I did when I was a teenager watching
[3:13:48.300 --> 3:13:53.580]  mafia movies and even some of the others that are highly acclaimed, I think Casino has been
[3:13:53.580 --> 3:13:54.580]  overlooked.
[3:13:54.580 --> 3:13:58.660]  It's a really good window into what we're talking about as well as the obvious choices
[3:13:58.660 --> 3:14:05.940]  like the Godfather, especially Godfather 2, where we see how Las Vegas is set up.
[3:14:05.940 --> 3:14:09.300]  Now all of that to say that this is raking in billions and billions and billions of
[3:14:09.300 --> 3:14:13.940]  dollars for the five families.
[3:14:13.940 --> 3:14:21.180]  And this power structure, this black market control obviously attracts the attention of
[3:14:21.180 --> 3:14:29.260]  entities like the CIA and the CIA finds so much partnership with the mafia going back
[3:14:29.260 --> 3:14:33.940]  to the wartime partnerships, as I said, that they had had with people like Vito Genovesi,
[3:14:33.940 --> 3:14:39.460]  right, who eventually, originally was pro Mussolini and then switched sides and kind
[3:14:39.460 --> 3:14:47.820]  of played both sides of the Axis and Allied powers during the war, excuse me.
[3:14:47.820 --> 3:14:52.420]  But regardless of what this leads to is the special relationship, right, between underworld
[3:14:52.420 --> 3:14:56.500]  figures, particularly in the case of hits, right.
[3:14:56.500 --> 3:15:01.340]  So if you have the CIA, one of the easiest ways to maybe pull off the assassination of
[3:15:01.340 --> 3:15:09.420]  someone and to appear to have no direct connection is to utilize mob hitmen or contract killers.
[3:15:09.420 --> 3:15:14.140]  And this is well known, there was a whole ring, right, of contract killers.
[3:15:14.140 --> 3:15:18.660]  Now I'm saying this because people think, well, there really couldn't be a big kind
[3:15:18.660 --> 3:15:24.980]  of conspiracy going on, right, I mean, Epstein, those are isolated instances of this kind.
[3:15:24.980 --> 3:15:25.980]  No, no, no.
[3:15:25.980 --> 3:15:30.620]  Do you understand that Albert Anastasia, right, the head of, was known as Murder Ain't
[3:15:30.620 --> 3:15:37.860]  Very Famous Thing, at one time he had underneath him a contract guild of killers, 250 killers
[3:15:37.860 --> 3:15:43.580]  that he could call upon, right, at any point, I think in the 50s, right, so 40s and 50s.
[3:15:43.580 --> 3:15:49.060]  So Murder Ain't Cause A Very Famous Example of the extent, right, of this ability to call
[3:15:49.060 --> 3:15:51.180]  upon contract killers.
[3:15:51.180 --> 3:15:58.820]  And if Albert Anastasia had a stable of 250 contract killers, do you think Uncle Sam has
[3:15:58.820 --> 3:16:02.540]  a stable, maybe better than that, that he could call upon, well, yes.
[3:16:02.540 --> 3:16:09.380]  And that's where we get this intimate connection between Uncle Sam and his contract killers.
[3:16:09.380 --> 3:16:13.660]  Now, if you follow my work, you know, I'm also doing a separate series where I'm covering
[3:16:13.660 --> 3:16:19.500]  serial killers, because these guys are serial killers, even though they're designated as
[3:16:19.500 --> 3:16:24.380]  just contract killers, and we're going to notice a lot of parallels between the Phoenix
[3:16:24.380 --> 3:16:29.780]  Program, Vietnam, and serial killers, right, so there's a lot of evidence to suggest, according
[3:16:29.780 --> 3:16:36.020]  to Dave McGowan's excellent book, Program to Kill, that perhaps there's an overlap between
[3:16:36.020 --> 3:16:42.460]  the contract-killing mafia government assassin world, Vietnam, Phoenix Program, and why we
[3:16:42.460 --> 3:16:47.660]  have so many serial killers, particularly in the 70s and 80s.
[3:16:47.660 --> 3:16:51.180]  Why is that just, where are all the serial killers, by the way, do they retire, are they
[3:16:51.180 --> 3:16:55.860]  being nice because of COVID, they're not going to, they don't want to get sick, right?
[3:16:55.860 --> 3:17:01.500]  No, it's because there was a specific event going on, particularly Vietnam War, which
[3:17:01.500 --> 3:17:06.140]  are crucial, I think, to understanding why there were so many serial killers who come
[3:17:06.140 --> 3:17:11.740]  back during that time period from their military service, right, anyway, but that's a separate
[3:17:11.740 --> 3:17:18.500]  issue from this world of the crime syndicates, but you see the parallels again here, right,
[3:17:18.500 --> 3:17:22.580]  you see the patterns that are evident, so we mentioned the figure of Sam Jankana, who
[3:17:22.580 --> 3:17:28.460]  again had a motivation to get rid of JFK and RFK because of helping get them elected,
[3:17:28.460 --> 3:17:34.460]  and then the spotlight being turned upon the mafia by both JFK and RFK.
[3:17:34.460 --> 3:17:39.940]  Now when it comes to the figure of Carlos Marcello, he's one of the chief pieces of
[3:17:39.940 --> 3:17:45.900]  the puzzle, right, in regard to JFK because while running the New Orleans outfit, right,
[3:17:45.900 --> 3:17:51.620]  in the New Orleans arm of the mafia, he was raking in billions and billions of dollars,
[3:17:51.620 --> 3:17:56.220]  and there's this funny incident where RFK goes after him.
[3:17:56.220 --> 3:18:00.300]  They can't pin him on anything as significant, this always comes up right with the mafia,
[3:18:00.300 --> 3:18:04.700]  you can never get them on anything except tax evasion, so they don't have anything hard
[3:18:04.700 --> 3:18:12.420]  to get Carlos Marcello, so RFK has secret service agents pick him up at his parole hearing
[3:18:12.420 --> 3:18:17.220]  at his, like, probation office, they secret him away to Guatemala, and they just drop
[3:18:17.220 --> 3:18:24.220]  him off in Guatemala, right, so he gets exiled from the country, Carlos Marcello has to basically
[3:18:24.220 --> 3:18:30.900]  wander his way walking back from Guatemala up and taking presumably his own shrimp boats
[3:18:30.900 --> 3:18:36.380]  eventually back to New Orleans, which his shrimp boats were a cover for heroin running,
[3:18:36.380 --> 3:18:40.860]  and then when he finally gets back into New Orleans, he famously says that effort is
[3:18:40.860 --> 3:18:44.780]  going to die or, you know, something like this, right, so again, clear motivations on
[3:18:44.780 --> 3:18:49.380]  the part of Carlos Marcello, and then we even have informants who were flipped, right, who
[3:18:49.380 --> 3:18:55.660]  made these claims, said that there was, you know, evidence of motivation, right, motive
[3:18:55.660 --> 3:19:00.140]  for why they wanted to get rid of RFK and JFK, and again, these are the very guys connected
[3:19:00.140 --> 3:19:07.140]  to the CIA, right, this comes up again with the figure of Santos Traficante, who was the
[3:19:07.140 --> 3:19:14.500]  mob boss of Florida, and Traficante was responsible for working with the CIA's usage of the Cuban
[3:19:14.500 --> 3:19:20.380]  expatriate exiles, right, so the Cuban expatriates come over, really, these are a lot of criminals,
[3:19:20.380 --> 3:19:25.540]  right, if you watch Scarface Castro, right, sends over basically, he opens up the prisons
[3:19:25.540 --> 3:19:31.500]  and sends all the criminals to the U.S., right, that's who Tony Montana is, right, and so
[3:19:31.500 --> 3:19:35.620]  that's who we're dealing with here, right, is the CIA directly using and trying to co-opt
[3:19:35.620 --> 3:19:40.980]  criminal elements for my cooperation, this is, you know, I'm sure it's going to go anywhere.
[3:19:40.980 --> 3:19:46.020]  You know, listeners call into the show and they thank me, and it makes me feel pathetic
[3:19:46.020 --> 3:19:51.660]  because I sit there and I beg you for support, constantly, for prayer, for financial support,
[3:19:51.660 --> 3:19:56.340]  and for word of mouth, and then we're all in this together, and you know, it gets old
[3:19:56.340 --> 3:19:59.340]  having to come to you and say, hey, I got great products, please bomb or we won't be
[3:19:59.340 --> 3:20:02.980]  here on air, but it's true, we're the only media organization in the United States that
[3:20:02.980 --> 3:20:07.620]  promotes liberty at this level that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors, and they
[3:20:07.620 --> 3:20:11.060]  have harassed and almost shut down everybody else, they crippled all the other groups,
[3:20:11.060 --> 3:20:16.060]  and we're still here, and as this whole new world order comes out in the open, our credibility
[3:20:16.060 --> 3:20:19.700]  is going up, that's why we've got to be taken off air, that's why America, we've got to
[3:20:19.700 --> 3:20:24.100]  be taken down, you can't have all these other nations enslaved, and America is still quasi-free,
[3:20:24.100 --> 3:20:28.540]  and you can't have info wars has been proven right, being on air, with all the craziness
[3:20:28.540 --> 3:20:32.340]  that's about to unfold, because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready, so thank
[3:20:32.340 --> 3:20:37.180]  you all, and get an infowarstore.com, get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements and
[3:20:37.180 --> 3:20:42.260]  so much more, they're wonderful products, and they support the infowar, thank you.
[3:20:42.260 --> 3:20:47.460]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large, the population has been trained to submit,
[3:20:47.460 --> 3:20:51.820]  do what you're told, and it's all going to pass, but if you study authoritarians, if
[3:20:51.820 --> 3:20:55.060]  you study the globalists, you understand that they reach a point where all the training
[3:20:55.060 --> 3:20:59.460]  is just beta, and you go into the point of being cold, being totally enslaved, and because
[3:20:59.460 --> 3:21:03.660]  the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move, and
[3:21:03.660 --> 3:21:07.780]  they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons, to then flood us with the
[3:21:07.780 --> 3:21:13.460]  third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis, under
[3:21:13.460 --> 3:21:18.380]  such a load, capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that
[3:21:18.380 --> 3:21:24.020]  they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees, not fleeing COVID or climate
[3:21:24.020 --> 3:21:28.620]  change, as the UN and Klaus Schwabber saying, and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the
[3:21:28.620 --> 3:21:34.660]  year-long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute, or they wouldn't
[3:21:34.660 --> 3:21:40.500]  get more IMF and World Bank money, and that's why we have to really get educated about the
[3:21:40.500 --> 3:21:41.500]  globalists.
[3:21:41.500 --> 3:21:45.500]  The general public has finally figured out why I'm upset.
[3:21:45.500 --> 3:21:48.740]  They figured out that the globalists are literally trying to kill us, they're trying
[3:21:48.740 --> 3:21:54.180]  to take over civilization and society, and they depend on the public being ignorant.
[3:21:54.180 --> 3:21:58.100]  That's what Jesus said, my people perish for lack of knowledge.
[3:21:58.100 --> 3:22:03.180]  Knowledge is power, like our bodies are made up of all these tissues and all these systems
[3:22:03.180 --> 3:22:07.900]  that die without essential vitamins and minerals, and that's why they don't want you to know
[3:22:07.900 --> 3:22:11.660]  about essential vitamins and minerals, because it's so simple, because you won't be under
[3:22:11.660 --> 3:22:13.060]  their control anymore.
[3:22:13.060 --> 3:22:17.700]  Well, the vitamin mineral fusion, the highest quality vitamin mineral fusion system out
[3:22:17.700 --> 3:22:22.340]  there in a liquid vitamin form is now back in stock at infowarstore.com, and it's not
[3:22:22.340 --> 3:22:27.500]  just an incredible formula at a great price, it funds the info war at the same time.

[3:22:32.660 --> 3:22:37.300]  50% off vitamin mineral fusion, I'm going to keep it at that until it sells out, so

[3:22:41.660 --> 3:22:46.580]  The people are awakening, they're taking control of their own environment, cell phones are
[3:22:46.580 --> 3:22:52.380]  an amazing tool, really they're a super computer that's handheld, but big tech, large corporations,
[3:22:52.380 --> 3:22:57.660]  makers, governments, foreign governments, the CHICOMS especially, are using this to steal
[3:22:57.660 --> 3:23:02.340]  your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop
[3:23:02.340 --> 3:23:07.220]  up billions of people's data, they can actually predict on record what's going to happen in
[3:23:07.220 --> 3:23:08.220]  mass movements.
[3:23:08.220 --> 3:23:15.620]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover, in their own
[3:23:15.620 --> 3:23:16.620]  words they admit it.
[3:23:16.620 --> 3:23:20.620]  So, I've been selling privacy pouches and blocket pockets and things like that for more
[3:23:20.620 --> 3:23:21.620]  than a decade.
[3:23:21.620 --> 3:23:25.100]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight, they're faraday cages, they just look like
[3:23:25.100 --> 3:23:30.060]  a cloth envelope, they work absolutely great and it just gives you that security to have
[3:23:30.060 --> 3:23:35.140]  power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want big
[3:23:35.140 --> 3:23:37.340]  brother to know what you're up to because it's another business.
[3:23:37.340 --> 3:24:06.820]  Get yours at infowarstored.com today.
[3:24:06.820 --> 3:24:10.900]  Welcome back to the Outdoor Jones Show and your guest is J. Dyer, Payton Alsis.
[3:24:10.900 --> 3:24:17.300]  I am the author of two absolutely necessary books, Esoteric Hollywood One and Esoteric
[3:24:17.300 --> 3:24:18.300]  Hollywood Two.
[3:24:18.300 --> 3:24:21.860]  If you want signed copies of these books, which actually do get into some of the material
[3:24:21.860 --> 3:24:26.420]  we're talking about today, in fact in part two, I have about a 30 or 40 page section
[3:24:26.420 --> 3:24:30.140]  on the relationship of the mafia to Hollywood.
[3:24:30.140 --> 3:24:34.380]  So you definitely want to get that great, excellent, excellent breakdown of the Godfather
[3:24:34.380 --> 3:24:35.380]  in that book.
[3:24:35.380 --> 3:24:40.300]  So go to jsonalsis.com and get in that shop and get those signed copies.
[3:24:40.300 --> 3:24:44.900]  Now we were talking about the figure of Carlos Marcello and why there was such a strong motivation
[3:24:44.900 --> 3:24:51.820]  on the part of the Kennedys to prosecute him and then in turn why he would then have an
[3:24:51.820 --> 3:24:59.380]  intense motive to go after the Kennedys, obviously, as well as the entire five families and their
[3:24:59.380 --> 3:25:00.380]  syndicates.
[3:25:00.380 --> 3:25:06.380]  Hoover is a curious figure in all this because, of course, Hoover was himself blackmailed
[3:25:06.380 --> 3:25:08.580]  probably by the mob.
[3:25:08.580 --> 3:25:15.380]  It would appear that the early phases of the investigations into criminal syndicates, there's
[3:25:15.380 --> 3:25:20.540]  this famous clip of Hoover saying, there is no such thing as the mafia.
[3:25:20.540 --> 3:25:24.580]  So here we have the government openly lying when for decades it actually known that there
[3:25:24.580 --> 3:25:30.580]  was through the character of Anslinger, who was himself the head of the Federal Bureau
[3:25:30.580 --> 3:25:35.420]  of Narcotics, Anslinger had detailed troves of information about criminal syndicates running
[3:25:35.420 --> 3:25:37.500]  the drugs and that they were all connected.
[3:25:37.500 --> 3:25:42.020]  And Hoover ignored all this and said, there is no criminal connection, it's just loose
[3:25:42.020 --> 3:25:46.580]  bands, it's just random chance stuff.
[3:25:46.580 --> 3:25:49.020]  Exactly the same lies the government continues to use.
[3:25:49.020 --> 3:25:54.540]  There's no organized crime, there's no international conspiracies of a new world order, it's just
[3:25:54.540 --> 3:25:57.620]  random power of people doing corrupt things.
[3:25:57.620 --> 3:25:59.980]  No, it's an organized criminal structure.
[3:25:59.980 --> 3:26:00.980]  Right?
[3:26:00.980 --> 3:26:07.180]  Again, how many years did the government itself lie about the existence of this and in fact,
[3:26:07.180 --> 3:26:11.620]  if you look at Sel and Rob's book, he goes into detail about how ignorant the FBI agents
[3:26:11.620 --> 3:26:12.620]  were.
[3:26:12.620 --> 3:26:18.500]  In fact, the FBI agents had to go learn Sicilian and had to go learn about power structures
[3:26:18.500 --> 3:26:22.300]  and criminal structures because they didn't even know how to approach this question.
[3:26:22.300 --> 3:26:23.300]  They didn't know what to look for.
[3:26:23.300 --> 3:26:27.500]  They didn't know how to decode, I'm not kidding, the slang.
[3:26:27.500 --> 3:26:31.220]  They had to learn Goomba or Goomba because they didn't know what they were listening
[3:26:31.220 --> 3:26:32.820]  to when they heard these tapes.
[3:26:32.820 --> 3:26:33.820]  Right?
[3:26:33.820 --> 3:26:38.500]  Anyway, so here you have Hoover being blackmail and that's why he keeps lying and saying there
[3:26:38.500 --> 3:26:44.140]  is no such thing as this, again, what are we told still?
[3:26:44.140 --> 3:26:48.020]  There's no such thing as conspiracy, it doesn't exist, what are you talking about?
[3:26:48.020 --> 3:26:52.020]  Here we have a real conspiracy on a national and international level.
[3:26:52.020 --> 3:26:56.060]  This is not just U.S., this stretches to other countries, right?
[3:26:56.060 --> 3:27:00.980]  And if you know about the CIA's connection to the drug trade, many, many books have been
[3:27:00.980 --> 3:27:05.300]  written about this, John Cloy's famous book, Politics of Heroin.
[3:27:05.300 --> 3:27:06.300]  You can see why.
[3:27:06.300 --> 3:27:10.980]  Well, who imports the heroine, the mafia, for who, right, for the black operations that
[3:27:10.980 --> 3:27:15.780]  the CIA is running in other countries, right, Afghanistan, right, et cetera, et cetera.
[3:27:15.780 --> 3:27:21.580]  So we know Golden Triangle, all these different hotspots for the trafficking of heroine relate
[3:27:21.580 --> 3:27:26.540]  directly to the intelligence agencies and relate directly to organized crime.
[3:27:26.540 --> 3:27:32.420]  Now this figure, as we said, of Marcello gets hauled in by RFK, right?
[3:27:32.420 --> 3:27:38.220]  And this is because Hoover had all these tapes that were secret that had all this really
[3:27:38.220 --> 3:27:42.100]  damaging information, but it couldn't be admitted to court, right?
[3:27:42.100 --> 3:27:46.760]  So it was basically just illegal wiretapping intel that they would use to get information
[3:27:46.760 --> 3:27:50.660]  on people, but they couldn't admit any of that in court, but it would give them the
[3:27:50.660 --> 3:27:56.500]  upper hand in terms of, you know, trying to make a bust or something, the FBI that is.
[3:27:56.500 --> 3:28:01.060]  So when the Warren Commission was formed to investigate JFK, of course it had Alan Dulles
[3:28:01.060 --> 3:28:06.220]  and all these, you know, dubious figures who were probably coloring up for what happened.
[3:28:06.220 --> 3:28:11.220]  Involved in the commission, yes, it was a cover-up, but they also didn't have this information
[3:28:11.220 --> 3:28:14.020]  that Hoover had withheld.
[3:28:14.020 --> 3:28:20.620]  So when this eventually became known, right, so after RFK and JFK tell Hoover, you know,
[3:28:20.620 --> 3:28:26.140]  that he'd better go after organized crime just as much as he went after all the commies,
[3:28:26.140 --> 3:28:30.860]  Hoover then switches the story and says, yes, I've been here from the get-go going after
[3:28:30.860 --> 3:28:34.420]  organized crime, and acts like he never said that there was no such thing as organized
[3:28:34.420 --> 3:28:36.940]  crime, right, or Kosinostrum.
[3:28:36.940 --> 3:28:38.060]  So then the story flips.
[3:28:38.060 --> 3:28:43.580]  He takes credit for all the stuff that actually, Ann Slinger and people before him had actually
[3:28:43.580 --> 3:28:51.180]  done, and then the government gets a hold, at least the later commission headed by RFK
[3:28:51.180 --> 3:28:55.700]  gets a hold of these tapes that have all the information about Carlos Marcello and these
[3:28:55.700 --> 3:28:59.740]  different monsters saying that they wanted to get rid of JFK and toasting his death and
[3:28:59.740 --> 3:29:02.820]  cheering when JFK is dead.
[3:29:02.820 --> 3:29:08.500]  Well this is what leads to this, I think, 1979 commission, right, and then when they
[3:29:08.500 --> 3:29:19.620]  haul in Marcello, right, this again just agitates, right, the anger at the mob for going after
[3:29:19.620 --> 3:29:27.140]  having JFK assassinated, right, so one month after the flipped informant Joe Bellaci gives
[3:29:27.140 --> 3:29:31.100]  his testimony, JFK is assassinated, right.
[3:29:31.100 --> 3:29:37.300]  Now the real crucial weird detail that pops up here is that the figure of Jack Ruby, who
[3:29:37.300 --> 3:29:43.740]  everybody knows, right, is who kills Oswald, the Warren commission and others just ignored
[3:29:43.740 --> 3:29:44.740]  these connections.
[3:29:44.740 --> 3:29:52.620]  They literally just ignore the fact that Jack Ruby kills Oswald while Oswald had lived for
[3:29:52.620 --> 3:29:59.780]  I think a year at least with Carlos Marcello's bookie, so Carlos Marcello, the head of New
[3:29:59.780 --> 3:30:00.780]  Orleans.
[3:30:00.780 --> 3:30:05.540]  Lee Harvey Oswald lives with this guy's bookie for a year and not only that, Jack Ruby has
[3:30:05.540 --> 3:30:11.140]  a bar strip club in Dallas that he co-shares and runs with Carlos Marcello.
[3:30:11.140 --> 3:30:15.300]  Well, apparently the Warren commission just decided that none of that was relevant.
[3:30:15.300 --> 3:30:24.180]  So shocker, right, government commission appointed to investigate mob involvement in JFK and
[3:30:24.180 --> 3:30:28.900]  government corruption involvement, right, oh, so basically the government, the bad guys
[3:30:28.900 --> 3:30:33.220]  say we didn't do it, right, the bad guys appointed commission to say we didn't do it, right,
[3:30:33.220 --> 3:30:37.780]  I mean, it's just ludicrous, because you can't trust these commissions, right, the Warren
[3:30:37.780 --> 3:30:41.980]  commission is kind of stuff, just like the 9-11 report, right, anybody who is familiar
[3:30:41.980 --> 3:30:47.460]  with the absurdities of the Warren commission, right, would have automatically been skeptical
[3:30:47.460 --> 3:30:51.500]  of the whole 9-11 commission report, right, because it's the same model of how things
[3:30:51.500 --> 3:30:57.300]  are covered up, right, just put a few powerful people involved in the thing on the commission,
[3:30:57.300 --> 3:31:02.460]  the same thing here, same thing 9-11 report.
[3:31:02.460 --> 3:31:07.580]  So that's what we get with this figure, and by the way, a couple other figures who were
[3:31:07.580 --> 3:31:13.780]  notorious Hitman who were scheduled to testify, right, in fact, two very important prominent
[3:31:13.780 --> 3:31:20.180]  mobsters scheduled to testify, namely most famously Sam Jankana, Momo himself was going
[3:31:20.180 --> 3:31:29.300]  to testify, he ends up killed a day before his testimony, and along with Momo, Hitman
[3:31:29.300 --> 3:31:36.660]  and John Roselli, right, so two famous Chicago outfit characters who were known to be recruited
[3:31:36.660 --> 3:31:43.700]  by the CIA for different operations, black ops, right, so John Roselli recruited to be
[3:31:43.700 --> 3:31:50.500]  involved in the getting rid of Fido Castro, he's also believed to be, right, in this investigation
[3:31:50.500 --> 3:31:55.500]  involved in the JFK assassination, oh, he ends up dead, shocked, right, so here we have people
[3:31:55.500 --> 3:32:00.380]  being offed, now, doesn't this sound familiar to, right, Epstein, I'm not saying this is
[3:32:00.380 --> 3:32:04.340]  civilian mafia, it's Epstein, I'm saying that the patterns emerge here, right, where
[3:32:04.340 --> 3:32:11.180]  Epstein just dies, it's all accidental, yes, he hung himself, don't question that at all.
[3:32:11.180 --> 3:32:15.140]  Anybody who reads the history of this kind of stuff, criminal syndicates, elite criminality,
[3:32:15.140 --> 3:32:21.580]  right, the history of corruption at elite levels knows that this is everywhere, right,
[3:32:21.580 --> 3:32:27.220]  corruption is everywhere, people being offed is everywhere, it shouldn't even be considered
[3:32:27.220 --> 3:32:31.740]  a conspiracy theory, it's ludicrous, but people are ignorant, they just don't know, in fact,
[3:32:31.740 --> 3:32:37.300]  entire New York Times best-selling books like Mafia Spies by Thomas Meyer, right, it's all
[3:32:37.300 --> 3:32:45.140]  about Sam Jankana, right, and the CIA, the CIA mafia link, and again, why would there
[3:32:45.140 --> 3:32:51.420]  be such a close connection between these entities, well, when we think back to the networks
[3:32:51.420 --> 3:32:55.740]  of the drugs, right, how they were run 100 years ago, right, the British Empire, French
[3:32:55.740 --> 3:32:59.460]  intelligence, right, they controlled these networks, right, everybody knows about the
[3:32:59.460 --> 3:33:04.180]  British Empire and opium in China, right, so they would control those drug lanes via
[3:33:04.180 --> 3:33:09.220]  their intelligence networks, and what do intelligence networks in this sense do, the same thing
[3:33:09.220 --> 3:33:15.900]  that criminal networks do, you say, so the CIA, the OSS, they just take over these drug
[3:33:15.900 --> 3:33:23.620]  lanes that were previously run by older imperial networks and control structures in black
[3:33:23.620 --> 3:33:29.940]  markets, right, and it's not just those things, it's also the trafficking of people, right,
[3:33:29.940 --> 3:33:33.980]  Finder's case, everybody knows about the Finder's case, the McMartin case, right, that kind of
[3:33:33.980 --> 3:33:41.380]  stuff is now the last year of the ID classified stuff, the conspiracy theorists on those events.
[3:33:41.380 --> 3:33:50.900]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness,

[3:34:49.060 --> 3:34:53.100]  the new world order is breathing down our neck, the big globalist publications are
[3:34:53.100 --> 3:34:56.940]  coming after us, and they're doing everything they can to shut us down, so please pray to

[3:35:12.340 --> 3:35:13.820]  in the face of this thing.
[3:35:13.820 --> 3:35:18.700]  I need your help more than ever now, I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't

[3:35:40.420 --> 3:35:43.260]  thank you so much.
[3:35:43.260 --> 3:35:49.340]  I knew Trump was embattled, I knew he was surrounded by cowards and by double talking
[3:35:49.340 --> 3:35:55.740]  agents of the enemy, and a lot of people just couldn't believe it, they're like oh no, it's
[3:35:55.740 --> 3:36:00.220]  just 3G chess, 5G chess, he's invincible, and I understand how people learn to believe
[3:36:00.220 --> 3:36:03.740]  that, because this is scary what's going on, the global government, the New World Order,
[3:36:03.740 --> 3:36:06.900]  and now that people woke up to the fact that that's real, they want somebody to come save
[3:36:06.900 --> 3:36:12.060]  them from, well Trump sure has held track, my gosh look it out, prescription drug prices
[3:36:12.060 --> 3:36:15.740]  just tripled for quadruple, depending on the drug, once you buy it and sign that executive
[3:36:15.740 --> 3:36:20.860]  order, we pay the most of anybody in the world, that's just one case of hundreds of things,
[3:36:20.860 --> 3:36:25.060]  that Trump had reversed, and now people are gonna feel the sting and the pain, the energy
[3:36:25.060 --> 3:36:30.180]  cost, everything else, but what's really illustrated this is the trial in the Senate, where Trump's
[3:36:30.180 --> 3:36:34.380]  own lawyers are attacking him and putting him down and saying he lost the election,
[3:36:34.380 --> 3:36:40.780]  and just engage all sorts of criminal activity, because the fix is in folks, the swamp is deep,
[3:36:40.780 --> 3:36:42.780]  Trump fought it, but it's up to us to win it.
[3:36:42.780 --> 3:36:47.500]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point, it's very bittersweet, everything we've talked
[3:36:47.500 --> 3:36:51.180]  about has happened just like we said it would, and now we have a lot of credibility, but
[3:36:51.180 --> 3:36:54.700]  I don't care about that, I care about beating the New World Order, and it's because we
[3:36:54.700 --> 3:36:59.140]  have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer, and I don't
[3:36:59.140 --> 3:37:02.420]  have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us, for a lot of reasons I can't
[3:37:02.420 --> 3:37:05.820]  tell you what's going on, but let's just say this, we're gonna see this through to the
[3:37:05.820 --> 3:37:10.780]  end, we're gonna stay on air as long as we can, so please pray for us and please buy
[3:37:10.780 --> 3:37:15.500]  the products, and then forwardstore.com, they're great products, plus they fund the operation,

[3:37:19.500 --> 3:37:24.460]  No, a lot of them don't, these are great products that fund freedom and fund justice, when the
[3:37:24.460 --> 3:37:28.820]  whole world's waking up and looking for truth, that's why the globalists are censoring, they
[3:37:28.820 --> 3:37:32.660]  can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air, so while you're
[3:37:32.660 --> 3:37:36.380]  at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word, download everything we've

[3:37:40.100 --> 3:37:45.100]  and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever...
[3:37:45.100 --> 3:38:02.500]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:38:02.500 --> 3:38:06.260]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show, I'm your guest host, JaydiarBusiness.com, you can find
[3:38:06.260 --> 3:38:12.100]  me on YouTube at Jaydiar, Twitter, just type in my name, Instagram, all those different
[3:38:12.100 --> 3:38:15.180]  sites to follow my work.
[3:38:15.180 --> 3:38:21.780]  Now we were talking about that 1979 select committee of a two-year reevaluation of the
[3:38:21.780 --> 3:38:26.980]  Warren Commission and the new information that had emerged about the admitted relationship
[3:38:26.980 --> 3:38:29.340]  between the CIA and the mafia.
[3:38:29.340 --> 3:38:36.300]  Now these admitted connections are the basis why a lot of people would posit that there
[3:38:36.300 --> 3:38:42.740]  was a common motivation for elements of the CIA and elements of the Sicilian and other
[3:38:42.740 --> 3:38:46.740]  mafias to want to get rid of JFK and RFK.
[3:38:46.740 --> 3:38:53.900]  And so that was because new tapes had emerged that Hoover had suppressed information about
[3:38:53.900 --> 3:38:59.820]  recordings of different bosses basically saying they wanted him dead, cheering it on, being
[3:38:59.820 --> 3:39:07.260]  loud after it happened, et cetera, in fact in 1963, even back to that point, Buffalo,
[3:39:07.260 --> 3:39:12.060]  the boss of the Buffalo family said that the feds had known it all due to all of the extensive
[3:39:12.060 --> 3:39:13.060]  wiretapping.
[3:39:13.060 --> 3:39:17.460]  And this is what's amazing is that Hoover just had these troves and troves and troves
[3:39:17.460 --> 3:39:27.420]  of illegal wiretaps and even flipped informants, right, basically had come out and vindicated
[3:39:27.420 --> 3:39:32.660]  a lot of the suspicions, and I say this because the first famous informant, Joe Vellacci basically
[3:39:32.660 --> 3:39:37.540]  said that, and now he was not some high-ranking figure, he was a lower level kind of just
[3:39:37.540 --> 3:39:45.380]  hitman, but he claims to have known of 20 murders that were done, that he was involved,
[3:39:45.380 --> 3:39:55.980]  excuse me, and as he, when he was flipped, he claimed that the, that there were in fact
[3:39:55.980 --> 3:40:01.340]  five families and five dons, the heads of those families, the name that they used secretly
[3:40:01.340 --> 3:40:06.580]  amongst them was, because the no-ster hour thing, all of the suspicions that many, quote,
[3:40:06.580 --> 3:40:11.420]  conspiracy theorists had were true, including that there was a quasi-Masonic ritual of
[3:40:11.420 --> 3:40:17.580]  a menta, the oath, and so the problem with Vellacci's testimony wasn't that the information
[3:40:17.580 --> 3:40:22.780]  was wrong, but that they couldn't go after the guys that were really doing the bad stuff,
[3:40:22.780 --> 3:40:23.780]  right?
[3:40:23.780 --> 3:40:28.340]  It was always this problem of finding the hard evidence because the way that the system
[3:40:28.340 --> 3:40:33.860]  was structured in this decentralized structure, anytime people busted the soldiers or the
[3:40:33.860 --> 3:40:38.580]  low-level criminals, right, they didn't even know the, through the cell compartmentalized
[3:40:38.580 --> 3:40:41.060]  structure who was running the operation, right?
[3:40:41.060 --> 3:40:46.260]  So the don, the boss was usually shielded by these layers and levels from actually
[3:40:46.260 --> 3:40:47.260]  getting caught.
[3:40:47.260 --> 3:40:48.260]  And guess what?
[3:40:48.260 --> 3:40:51.980]  That's how intelligence operations work, that's how shadow government works, and that's
[3:40:51.980 --> 3:40:57.060]  why it's so difficult to ever go after the real power structure, right?
[3:40:57.060 --> 3:41:01.100]  The real deep state, the real corrupt elements of the government is that they're shielded
[3:41:01.100 --> 3:41:06.620]  and they operate kind of in the shadows, hence shadow government, hence cryptocracy, right,
[3:41:06.620 --> 3:41:10.060]  hence secret government, deep state, blah, blah, blah.
[3:41:10.060 --> 3:41:15.060]  It's that same model where the people that get busted are the ones that are the patsies,
[3:41:15.060 --> 3:41:17.380]  the lower-level crooks, right?
[3:41:17.380 --> 3:41:19.340]  They might burn somebody like an Epstein, right?
[3:41:19.340 --> 3:41:23.540]  If you know about the Dutrou case, the Dutrou affair of the women being caught in the dungeons
[3:41:23.540 --> 3:41:28.140]  and all the Belgian elite, right, and even the royalty being involved in these parties,
[3:41:28.140 --> 3:41:32.900]  these basically eyes-wide shut sacrifice rituals, the only guy who gets busted and takes the
[3:41:32.900 --> 3:41:39.260]  fall is the guy who's the procure, right, Mark Dutrou, in the case of Savile, right?
[3:41:39.260 --> 3:41:42.580]  None of the really high-level people get busted or in trouble, oh, it's Jimmy Savile
[3:41:42.580 --> 3:41:45.580]  who's doing all this, right?
[3:41:45.580 --> 3:41:46.820]  That's the pattern here, right?
[3:41:46.820 --> 3:41:52.140]  It's that the contract killers, right, the wacko, psycho-serial killer types that they
[3:41:52.140 --> 3:41:57.260]  use are the ones that get busted, meanwhile, the people at the top, right?
[3:41:57.260 --> 3:41:59.980]  Same model, right, as like intelligence operations, right?
[3:41:59.980 --> 3:42:04.860]  The guys in Washington, D.C., they're the ones that call the shots and they have the
[3:42:04.860 --> 3:42:09.940]  people out, you know, fighting the battles, meanwhile, they don't ever see the battlefield.
[3:42:09.940 --> 3:42:13.100]  They don't ever do anything themselves.
[3:42:13.100 --> 3:42:20.340]  And as we said, another important figure is the head of the Florida family, Traficante.
[3:42:20.340 --> 3:42:25.460]  Traficante was tied to the anti-Castro Cuban exiles that were recruited by the CIA to try
[3:42:25.460 --> 3:42:27.380]  to do the Bay of Pigs, right?
[3:42:27.380 --> 3:42:31.060]  So we have a direct connection that nobody denies existed.
[3:42:31.060 --> 3:42:36.820]  We can't forget the figure of Hoffa because, in fact, the coordinate sense of Traficante,
[3:42:36.820 --> 3:42:43.420]  Jimmy Hoffa was targeted by the Genovese family precisely because he was put in this position
[3:42:43.420 --> 3:42:48.900]  between RFK barking orders at Jimmy Hoffa telling him what to do and also the mafia
[3:42:48.900 --> 3:42:51.060]  telling Jimmy Hoffa what to do as the head of the union.
[3:42:51.060 --> 3:42:57.060]  So he was put in a rob between a hard place and, of course, this ended up him being off.
[3:42:57.060 --> 3:43:01.140]  And that's the claim of Santa Traficante, is that no one will ever find Jimmy Hoffa's
[3:43:01.140 --> 3:43:06.100]  body because it was disposed of, in other words, right, it was melted, right?
[3:43:06.100 --> 3:43:12.060]  Carlos Marcello had the pattern of he would send his men to grab your body and put you
[3:43:12.060 --> 3:43:15.060]  in a lie and then they would dump you in the bogs, right?
[3:43:15.060 --> 3:43:20.420]  So you got bogged in the literal sense, right, in the case of Carlos Marcello.
[3:43:20.420 --> 3:43:27.580]  But the reason, again, that Traficante is so important is that he was a direct connect
[3:43:27.580 --> 3:43:35.020]  of CIA operator Robert Mayhew who was the point man for trying to co-op mobsters like
[3:43:35.020 --> 3:43:40.300]  John Rosselli and like Momo, Sam Giancona and Santa Traficante.
[3:43:40.300 --> 3:43:44.860]  And so reportedly when they had this investigation, the select committee, they tried to figure
[3:43:44.860 --> 3:43:53.260]  out what happened to the $150,000 that Robert Mayhew had sent to some of these mobsters
[3:43:53.260 --> 3:43:54.260]  for this hit.
[3:43:54.260 --> 3:43:57.140]  It could never be figured out, never be tracked down.
[3:43:57.140 --> 3:44:01.500]  And the night before, as we said, Sam Giancona was going to be brought in to testify, he's
[3:44:01.500 --> 3:44:04.340]  killed, John Rosselli is also killed.
[3:44:04.340 --> 3:44:08.100]  So two of the key figures in this operation are gone.
[3:44:08.100 --> 3:44:11.380]  Santa Traficante himself says, oh, I don't know anything, right?
[3:44:11.380 --> 3:44:14.220]  Although he was close buddies with Jack Ruby.
[3:44:14.220 --> 3:44:21.020]  So again, this whole world is very intimately connected, but magically nobody knows anybody.
[3:44:21.020 --> 3:44:27.300]  And then we find out, of course, as we said, that Oswald ends up in New Orleans during
[3:44:27.300 --> 3:44:34.500]  this phase before the operation, directly living with Carlos Marcelo's bookie.
[3:44:34.500 --> 3:44:40.740]  Now all of that is, again, just to kind of demonstrate that these worlds closely interact.
[3:44:40.740 --> 3:44:50.500]  As we said, the importation of heroin into the U.S. in the 1950s was 90% Sicilian mafia.
[3:44:50.500 --> 3:44:54.860]  The five families were responsible for 90% of that heroin.
[3:44:54.860 --> 3:45:01.740]  And in order to maintain this power structure, they had, as we said, a guild of 250 plus
[3:45:01.740 --> 3:45:06.220]  hitmen in the days of Albert Anastasia in the 50s.
[3:45:06.220 --> 3:45:12.260]  So one of the important points that we want to talk about that leads to the demise, right?
[3:45:12.260 --> 3:45:16.700]  And obviously, those hearings were important, but the media attention, right, as this key
[3:45:16.700 --> 3:45:21.260]  file we're going after the mafia, all of the media attention is what leads to the demise
[3:45:21.260 --> 3:45:24.180]  of the Sicilian mafia's power and influence and wealth.
[3:45:24.180 --> 3:45:27.660]  I mean, I don't know to what degree they still have power and wealth.
[3:45:27.660 --> 3:45:28.660]  That's anybody's guess.
[3:45:28.660 --> 3:45:37.940]  But in terms of the known history of the decades previous, the intense media attention is what
[3:45:37.940 --> 3:45:43.940]  draws them into the spotlight and then makes these operations more and more difficult,
[3:45:43.940 --> 3:45:44.940]  right?
[3:45:44.940 --> 3:45:49.900]  Once you have the dons on TV, right, this becomes more and more problematic.
[3:45:49.900 --> 3:45:57.460]  And so another incident that happens in 1956, 1957, that begins this domino fall, downfall
[3:45:57.460 --> 3:45:59.380]  is the Appalachia meeting, right?
[3:45:59.380 --> 3:46:04.780]  So in Appalachia, New York, they have this famous meeting of all the mobsters there in
[3:46:04.780 --> 3:46:05.780]  New York.
[3:46:05.780 --> 3:46:10.700]  And the local police in this small town realize something's up because you have like 100 Cadillacs
[3:46:10.700 --> 3:46:13.500]  all lined up at some house in the middle of nowhere.
[3:46:13.500 --> 3:46:17.420]  So they bust this meeting and a bunch of the guys go running off into the woods, which
[3:46:17.420 --> 3:46:21.780]  if you watch the Sopranos, this is kind of hinted at in one of the episodes of the Sopranos
[3:46:21.780 --> 3:46:27.940]  where the FBI stormed this meeting that Tony's having with Johnny Sacks and Tony ends up
[3:46:27.940 --> 3:46:33.220]  running off into the snow, right, in his suit and he has to run for several miles.
[3:46:33.220 --> 3:46:38.220]  That's hinting at the famous Appalachia meeting, which begins the downfall, right?
[3:46:38.220 --> 3:46:43.780]  So more and more media spotlight, more and more Senate hearings, more and more government
[3:46:43.780 --> 3:46:55.860]  hearings by the time of the head of the Gambino family, Frank Costello.
[3:46:55.860 --> 3:47:00.660]  Frank Costello also seems to be a very Tony Soprano-esque character.
[3:47:00.660 --> 3:47:03.500]  I think Tony is a composite of many different mobsters.
[3:47:03.500 --> 3:47:10.140]  But with Frank Costello, you have a guy who basically lives this outlandish, garish lifestyle.
[3:47:10.140 --> 3:47:17.980]  He builds a huge multi-million-dollar mansion and operates like a CEO.
[3:47:17.980 --> 3:47:22.140]  And you'll notice that a lot of these mob power structures are very similar to CEO as
[3:47:22.140 --> 3:47:23.660]  well.
[3:47:23.660 --> 3:47:27.500]  And then he ends up getting busted in much of a similar way to Tony Soprano, where the
[3:47:27.500 --> 3:47:34.100]  FBI bugs his kitchen, in the case of Tony, it's the basement.
[3:47:34.100 --> 3:47:38.500]  And they record him saying all these things that he plans to do and so forth.
[3:47:38.500 --> 3:47:42.780]  So Frank Costello, and then it passes on, the Gambino passes on to John Gotti.
[3:47:42.780 --> 3:47:47.460]  John Gotti has the same problem where he loves the media attention, loves the spotlight constantly
[3:47:47.460 --> 3:47:50.540]  on TV, constantly in these interviews.
[3:47:50.540 --> 3:47:54.460]  And just all this attention just ends up being a huge problem.
[3:47:54.460 --> 3:47:59.380]  And so my point here is not again to say that it's the Sicilian mafia that runs the world,
[3:47:59.380 --> 3:48:06.540]  but the way that power structure is set up in that pyramidal decentralized structure,
[3:48:06.540 --> 3:48:11.220]  it insulates the higher levels from prosecution and getting in trouble, and really the only
[3:48:11.220 --> 3:48:16.060]  way to go against this kind of a thing, in the case of the New World Order, the Fortune
[3:48:16.060 --> 3:48:19.940]  100, the elite, is to shine the light on it.
[3:48:19.940 --> 3:48:23.620]  That makes it more and more difficult for them to do what they're doing.
[3:48:23.620 --> 3:48:39.780]  So it's just a window into how global conspiracy acts.
