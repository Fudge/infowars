[00:38.000 --> 00:44.000]  welcome my friends welcome another very important transmission lined up for
[00:44.000 --> 00:52.000]  you today it is Thursday the 7th day of April 2011 Lyndon LaRouche via video
[00:52.000 --> 00:56.000]  connection for the prison planet TV viewers audio for all the great radio
[00:56.000 --> 01:01.000]  listeners will be joining us for an hour coming up in the second hour today and
[01:01.000 --> 01:05.000]  then a man who needs no introduction as well David Ike will be joining us with
[01:05.000 --> 01:10.000]  his take on Bretton Woods to the open announcements of world government to be
[01:10.000 --> 01:14.000]  our political and financial savior via the crisis the banksters created
[01:14.000 --> 01:20.000]  themselves and we'll also get into Libya so Lyndon LaRouche and David Ike joining
[01:20.000 --> 01:27.000]  us today there has been a another big earthquake in Japan first they reported
[01:27.000 --> 01:34.000]  it was 7.4 now they're reducing it down to 7.1 a small tsunami only about a
[01:34.000 --> 01:39.000]  meter high did go into the east coast of Japan but Fukushima is reporting that
[01:39.000 --> 01:43.000]  it didn't cause any problems with their history of lying we don't know if
[01:43.000 --> 01:47.000]  that's true or not but in incredible developments earthquake shakes wide
[01:47.000 --> 01:53.000]  area of southern Mexico a 6.5 earthquake shook a wide area of southern and
[01:53.000 --> 01:56.000]  central Mexico today sending people flaying into the streets but there
[01:56.000 --> 02:01.000]  were no initial reports of damage or death certainly good news there magnitude
[02:01.000 --> 02:09.000]  6.5 in Veracruz Mexico originally 7.4 near the east coast of Japan now down
[02:09.000 --> 02:14.000]  graded down to 7.1 this is the big development though Japan considers
[02:14.000 --> 02:21.000]  wider nuclear evacuation zone AFP is reporting of course our government
[02:21.000 --> 02:24.000]  saying no problem don't worry about the radiation blowing over directly towards
[02:24.000 --> 02:29.000]  us but in the opposite direction of the fallout MSNBC reports South Korea
[02:29.000 --> 02:36.000]  shut schools amid Japan radiation fears we are geographically closer to Japan
[02:36.000 --> 02:41.000]  than the US or Europe people are bound to be more worried the president says so
[02:41.000 --> 02:45.000]  most the schools have shut down are gone to partial days tell people to stay
[02:45.000 --> 02:50.000]  indoors because of rain blowing in that reportedly has some of the backwash of
[02:50.000 --> 02:56.000]  the radiation from Japan get a lot of emails saying where's Paul Watson the
[02:56.000 --> 03:00.000]  last week where's Paul Watson well his wife is Chinese once a year they visit
[03:00.000 --> 03:04.000]  her family in China for a week and a half he'll be back in a few days but I
[03:04.000 --> 03:08.000]  couldn't dissuade Paul from going to China which is a directly in the
[03:08.000 --> 03:11.000]  backwash of the radiation not just the stuff blowing around the world but the
[03:11.000 --> 03:18.000]  winds sometimes change south and then it blows it over towards China and South
[03:18.000 --> 03:23.000]  Korea and then blows back up into the higher trade winds and out east again
[03:23.000 --> 03:26.000]  towards the United States but they are picking up higher levels of radiation
[03:26.000 --> 03:31.000]  in South Korea and in China so big news there they're taking it serious but
[03:31.000 --> 03:36.000]  not here New York City restaurants using radiation detectors on fish from the
[03:36.000 --> 03:43.000]  Pacific we're going to be going over all of this after the first break also it's
[03:43.000 --> 03:47.000]  now coming out we reported on over a month ago Gaddafi paid millions to US
[03:47.000 --> 03:52.000]  firms to polish his global image and CNN is scapegoating lobbying firms
[03:52.000 --> 03:59.000]  who I'm not a fan of but for trying to polish his PR image with the lobbying
[03:59.000 --> 04:04.000]  firms made the point that they interview in this piece that we have linked up on
[04:04.000 --> 04:10.000]  infowars.com that Bush did a deal with him and said that he was now a good guy
[04:10.000 --> 04:14.000]  and so we were directed to basically polish his image and so why are you
[04:14.000 --> 04:19.000]  scapegoating us the actual I'm surprised CNN even let them respond that way I
[04:19.000 --> 04:23.000]  mean they're like low-level street thugs do you go after them or Don Corleone
[04:23.000 --> 04:27.000]  their boss you know why did the federal government do this what was to lure him
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.000]  in so they could get spies and agents and systems in place to then take his
[04:31.000 --> 04:37.000]  country down rebels are shoring up their status with diplomacy and oil money
[04:37.000 --> 04:42.000]  also I see these reports every few months going back for 15 years there's a
[04:42.000 --> 04:47.000]  new one in the Associated Press when a police dog jumps at you or tries to bite
[04:47.000 --> 04:50.000]  you or you're walking through a parking lot and the windows open and the squad
[04:50.000 --> 04:54.000]  car and it barks at you if you yell at it you get arrested and that's now
[04:54.000 --> 04:58.000]  happened again we'll break that down as well

[08:48.000 --> 08:53.000]  listeners are the tip of the spear integrating with this radio show against
[08:53.000 --> 08:59.000]  the globalist I want to salute and thank you all as the truth rises as the
[08:59.000 --> 09:03.000]  tyranny comes in like a flood the spirit of the Lord is lifting up a standard
[09:03.000 --> 09:06.000]  against it now we have Lyndon LaRouche who's never been a guest on this show
[09:06.000 --> 09:11.000]  joining us via video an audio connection coming up from his studios in the
[09:11.000 --> 09:14.000]  second hour David Ike's going to be joining us on the economy Bretton Woods
[09:14.000 --> 09:18.000]  to with George Soros and the crises they've instigated to bring in their
[09:18.000 --> 09:22.000]  solution open world government will also get into Libya with him obviously
[09:22.000 --> 09:30.000]  a 7.1 downgraded from a 7.4 hit the east coast of Japan again today a meter
[09:30.000 --> 09:36.000]  tall so that's not very big thank God the tsunami did come in another 6.4
[09:36.000 --> 09:41.000]  earthquake hit central and southern Mexico today didn't cause a lot of
[09:41.000 --> 09:45.000]  damage and didn't cause any deaths but it shows that tectonic activity is
[09:45.000 --> 09:51.000]  certainly intensifying we're going to be going over that information we're
[09:51.000 --> 09:55.000]  also going to be breaking down the economic news US going same route as
[09:55.000 --> 10:02.000]  Greece Portugal says top economist CNBC but before I get into all of that news
[10:02.000 --> 10:06.000]  and then run out of time with the two guests we've got coming up I want to
[10:06.000 --> 10:11.000]  spend just a few minutes on Glenn Beck not because we're even talking so much
[10:11.000 --> 10:15.000]  about Glenn Beck that we're discussing what's happening to the mainstream
[10:15.000 --> 10:23.000]  media and the alternative media Glenn Beck obviously yesterday announced that
[10:23.000 --> 10:27.000]  he's going to be phased out of Fox he doesn't know how soon that will happen
[10:27.000 --> 10:30.000]  but his contracts up in December and that as soon as they ask him to leave he
[10:30.000 --> 10:33.000]  will leave it could be a week it could be a month it could be three months it
[10:33.000 --> 10:37.000]  could be six months we don't know when Glenn Beck is going to leave now that
[10:37.000 --> 10:42.000]  end of itself is not that important of an issue I did talk to Fox insiders in
[10:42.000 --> 10:46.000]  the last two months and was told the word was that Glenn Beck was going to be
[10:46.000 --> 10:51.000]  forced out so if anyone is wondering whether Glenn Beck quit Roger Ailes
[10:51.000 --> 10:55.000]  talked to the AP yesterday and he said half the media says we fired him the
[10:55.000 --> 10:58.000]  other half the media says he quit we're happy with that I'm not going to say
[10:58.000 --> 11:03.000]  well I can tell you the word is that they could see his numbers dropping by
[11:03.000 --> 11:09.000]  about a third a year on average and that he was the lowest demo they had in
[11:09.000 --> 11:14.000]  young audiences during their prime time shows and that that was the big kicker
[11:14.000 --> 11:18.000]  and then he didn't fit in with their model and the George Soros groups
[11:18.000 --> 11:24.000]  knocking out 400 of his advertisers that that was also basically the straw
[11:24.000 --> 11:30.000]  that broke the camel's back now listening to Glenn Beck yesterday listening
[11:30.000 --> 11:33.000]  to him this morning monitoring it he basically said what we've been saying
[11:33.000 --> 11:37.000]  for years that the mainstream media is imploding that's the main reason his
[11:37.000 --> 11:42.000]  ratings went down along with the rest of Fox CNN MSNBC they're all in
[11:42.000 --> 11:47.000]  free fall because people don't like mainstream news anymore once you've
[11:47.000 --> 11:51.000]  heard alternative news and the wide spectrum of alternative ideas doesn't
[11:51.000 --> 11:55.000]  mean it's all accurate or even correct it's still just a wider spectrum
[11:55.000 --> 11:59.000]  for people to basically sample from once you're given more choices there's
[11:59.000 --> 12:05.000]  no going back to broadcast TV to cable TV it's falling apart it's fine to
[12:05.000 --> 12:09.000]  have cable TV or broadcast TV is a supplement but Glenn Beck this morning
[12:09.000 --> 12:13.000]  I was listening to him driving in said that the old media is basically dead
[12:13.000 --> 12:18.000]  and he said those of you celebrating my leaving Fox your fools you ain't seen
[12:18.000 --> 12:23.000]  nothing yet and he said he's going to target a younger audience well Glenn
[12:23.000 --> 12:27.000]  Beck younger audiences don't like you and I've seen the demographics your
[12:27.000 --> 12:32.000]  average person that watches you is about 65 70 I'm not saying that's a bad thing
[12:32.000 --> 12:37.000]  those are great people but Fox News is audience is alternative media for old
[12:37.000 --> 12:42.000]  people and people that don't understand the spectrum shift but the larger
[12:42.000 --> 12:48.000]  issue is what does Glenn Beck's meteoric rise and now a bit of a fall
[12:48.000 --> 12:53.000]  signify just three years ago when he joined Fox two and a half years ago
[12:53.000 --> 12:57.000]  Fox said there's no such thing as a world government no such thing as a
[12:57.000 --> 13:01.000]  council on foreign relations no such thing as the Bilderberg group they
[13:01.000 --> 13:07.000]  did not speak its name since then it's all over their channels and you see
[13:07.000 --> 13:12.000]  Hannity you see all of them moving more towards what Beck was doing so
[13:12.000 --> 13:17.000]  basically they're getting rid of back so they can just basically take my
[13:17.000 --> 13:22.000]  information hence his information and spin it in a Republicanoid way but on
[13:22.000 --> 13:27.000]  a larger front hanging over this of the statements of Senator J. Rockefeller
[13:27.000 --> 13:32.000]  Lieberman and others openly saying they'd be happy to not have MSNBC or
[13:32.000 --> 13:36.000]  Fox even being on the air that's a J. Rockefeller quote from three months ago
[13:36.000 --> 13:41.000]  because to get market share they've got to be more radical more honest more
[13:41.000 --> 13:45.000]  hardcore to compete with the internet well we're not controlled or restricted
[13:45.000 --> 13:52.000]  by anyone but our own ideas and our own conscience and so they allowed MSNBC
[13:52.000 --> 13:57.000]  with Oberman they allowed Fox in the establishment to try to try to corner
[13:57.000 --> 14:02.000]  the market of alternative views and awakening through MSNBC CNN and Fox
[14:02.000 --> 14:07.000]  but that basically the systems discovered just pushes more people to the real
[14:07.000 --> 14:13.000]  McCoy once they've had the facsimile the twisted doppelganger the fraudulent
[14:13.000 --> 14:19.000]  establishment version of real news that simply became a gateway a doorway that
[14:19.000 --> 14:23.000]  swung both ways sure we send listeners to them but they send even more listeners
[14:23.000 --> 14:28.000]  and viewers to us and they look at my YouTube channels 300 million views the
[14:28.000 --> 14:32.000]  last two years alone they look at my films together over 100 million views
[14:32.000 --> 14:38.000]  separately they look at the number one numbers meteorically rising info wars
[14:38.000 --> 14:43.000]  dwarfing both of Glenbeck's websites combined limb boss site combined and
[14:43.000 --> 14:48.000]  they see the growth curve they see drudge growing they can't compete drudge
[14:48.000 --> 14:52.000]  recognize this five years ago began reporting on Bilderberg group began
[14:52.000 --> 14:57.000]  reporting on the new world order began linking to our stories you can see it
[14:57.000 --> 15:01.000]  whether he began to awaken or whether he understood which way the wind was
[15:01.000 --> 15:05.000]  blowing I haven't talked to drudge so I don't know but you notice he was run out
[15:05.000 --> 15:10.000]  of Fox for refusing to not be you know pro-death he was run out for being pro-life
[15:10.000 --> 15:16.000]  and being an activist and what was that a decade ago and so what's happening
[15:16.000 --> 15:20.000]  here is the establishment in older communicators saying stop the rhetoric
[15:20.000 --> 15:24.000]  stop the anger the people are too dangerous they could rebel against the
[15:24.000 --> 15:28.000]  government we've got a real revolution on our hands politically and perhaps
[15:28.000 --> 15:34.000]  physically show the messages at Fox CNN MSNBC lower the rhetoric lower the tone
[15:34.000 --> 15:39.000]  that's what George Soros parrots like media matters and a gaggle of other
[15:39.000 --> 15:45.000]  cruisers he's got in the in their war of lies they're saying a great victory that
[15:45.000 --> 15:49.000]  becks going off now we can lower the rhetoric on both sides we can put
[15:49.000 --> 15:53.000]  everybody back to sleep we can continue the globalist agenda George Soros
[15:53.000 --> 15:57.000]  can have his Bretton Woods to openly calling for an end of the dollar and
[15:57.000 --> 16:01.000]  world government and Beck won't be there to criticizing but we're going to be
[16:01.000 --> 16:05.000]  here on the Internet and on AM and FM stations and the genies out of the
[16:05.000 --> 16:10.000]  bottle show they're going to move with the EAS alert system over radio TV and
[16:10.000 --> 16:15.000]  internet and that's in the news today with government break-ins on your smart
[16:15.000 --> 16:22.000]  phones on your AM and FM dial on your cable dial on your UHF VHF high def
[16:22.000 --> 16:27.000]  system here's associated press US to use Facebook Twitter to issue terror
[16:27.000 --> 16:32.000]  alerts and it will break in over the transmissions a month and a half ago
[16:32.000 --> 16:37.000]  federal news radio did an interview with the head of the EAS system and they
[16:37.000 --> 16:41.000]  said yes we're going to start breaking in when you go to Walmart or Mall of
[16:41.000 --> 16:46.000]  America or thousands of other 9000 locations total big telescreens now
[16:46.000 --> 16:51.000]  going in already in many areas of the country saying spy on your neighbors
[16:51.000 --> 16:55.000]  don't trust anyone with government to create this artificial atmosphere of
[16:55.000 --> 17:00.000]  fear that terrorists are hiding under every table the globalists know they've
[17:00.000 --> 17:05.000]  robbed us they know they own both parties they know Ron Paul's rising they
[17:05.000 --> 17:09.000]  know alternative media is rising so they will launch false flags on the
[17:09.000 --> 17:13.000]  internet as a pretext of crackdown on it they will come out with internet ID
[17:13.000 --> 17:17.000]  tracking systems you've got to log in to get online they will try to force the
[17:17.000 --> 17:22.000]  architecture over to cloud systems where you put all of your data on remote
[17:22.000 --> 17:25.000]  servers and don't control it yourself they will move in with internet
[17:25.000 --> 17:29.000]  taxation regulation that's already begun all over the country in the world
[17:29.000 --> 17:36.000]  they will move in with FCC financed taxpayer funded broadband so they can
[17:36.000 --> 17:39.000]  then say now we have a right to censor it and control it and put announcements
[17:39.000 --> 17:45.000]  over it that's begun in Europe now beginning here also it's in a whole
[17:45.000 --> 17:49.000]  bunch of mainstream news articles today but but but just like six seven years
[17:49.000 --> 17:53.000]  ago they only they're cherry picking a few like oh Armstrong Williams got a
[17:53.000 --> 17:57.000]  quarter million to push no child left behind and say it was conservative or
[17:57.000 --> 18:01.000]  oh this reporter got a million bucks over a year instead of looking at the
[18:01.000 --> 18:05.000]  tens of billions that the congressional reports admit in fake news that
[18:05.000 --> 18:10.000]  started decades ago but intensify every administration it's in the news today
[18:10.000 --> 18:14.000]  that hundreds of billions of dollars of your taxpayer money that the fellow
[18:14.000 --> 18:19.000]  reserve didn't want you in the last three years two and a half years October
[18:19.000 --> 18:24.000]  2008 they wouldn't tell Congress where the money went now we know why a few
[18:24.000 --> 18:28.000]  months ago they got some of the documents hundreds of billions into foreign
[18:28.000 --> 18:34.000]  banks billions and billions to MSNBC newspapers reporters buying them off
[18:34.000 --> 18:39.000]  now we've gotten a fresh batch of documents and Kurt Nemo has a report on
[18:39.000 --> 18:46.000]  that today at info wars dot com that again just scratches the surface Obama
[18:46.000 --> 18:50.000]  doles out taxpayer cash to corporate media show not only are they going to
[18:50.000 --> 18:54.000]  attack the alternative media not only they're going to try to use copyright
[18:54.000 --> 18:58.000]  laws they can't even link to things not only are they going to try taxes
[18:58.000 --> 19:04.000]  regulations their own sensor hubs being put in all the ISPs through the
[19:04.000 --> 19:09.000]  internet kill switch run by the Pentagon through the cyber security command of
[19:09.000 --> 19:15.000]  all four branches of the military but they're going to intensify publicly
[19:15.000 --> 19:22.000]  financing with your tax money MSNBC CNN Fox CNBC they all get money
[19:22.000 --> 19:27.000]  there's listings today in these reports of scores of local newspapers
[19:27.000 --> 19:34.000]  reporters you name it who are getting secret supplemental money from the
[19:34.000 --> 19:39.000]  Federal Reserve private Federal Reserve you know we say the government's
[19:39.000 --> 19:43.000]  financing this they're doing some of it but a lot of the money is direct
[19:43.000 --> 19:48.000]  corporate payments by the private Federal Reserve to the dominant media so
[19:48.000 --> 19:52.000]  they know they're in a war against the truth and they're declaring war on us
[19:52.000 --> 19:56.000]  so alternative media needs your support they're also going to use fake grassroots

[21:07.000 --> 21:10.000]  relies on the treasury continuously selling large amounts of government
[21:10.000 --> 21:16.000]  bonds to foreign central banks with Japan about to become a seller of US bonds
[21:16.000 --> 21:21.000]  in order to rebuild its own nation and the US antagonizing China by calling them
[21:21.000 --> 21:25.000]  currency manipulators the Federal Reserve which is already buying about 70%
[21:25.000 --> 21:29.000]  of US treasuries will soon be the only buyer left of US treasuries our friends
[21:29.000 --> 21:33.000]  at the National Inflation Association believe that the US dollar will soon
[21:33.000 --> 21:37.000]  become worthless and Americans will see the purchasing power of their incomes
[21:37.000 --> 21:42.000]  and savings destroyed I strongly urge my fellow Americans to sign up for the

[22:14.000 --> 22:18.000]  social security would be there for you that's not what's happening you might
[22:18.000 --> 22:23.000]  even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation or that the
[22:23.000 --> 22:27.000]  dollar wouldn't lose value or that your retirement would be secure if all looks

[24:18.000 --> 24:24.000]  news in the next segment when I say this I don't want to mince words and I
[24:24.000 --> 24:29.000]  want it to telegraph out to everyone and I want you to really consciously hear
[24:29.000 --> 24:34.000]  what I'm saying to you right now the globalist from Cass Sunstein at the
[24:34.000 --> 24:39.000]  White House to the Pentagon to cybersecurity to J. Rockefeller and
[24:39.000 --> 24:46.000]  their counterparts in Europe Asia Australia have all announced that they
[24:46.000 --> 24:53.000]  are declaring absolute open total war against the once free internet and
[24:53.000 --> 24:59.000]  alternative media quote J. Rockefeller I'd be glad if we shut down MSNBC and
[24:59.000 --> 25:06.000]  Fox close quote Cass Sunstein we need to arrest people that criticize the
[25:06.000 --> 25:10.000]  government people that don't agree with anthropogenic global warming man may
[25:10.000 --> 25:15.000]  global warming we need to at least find them or tax them or feed them and we
[25:15.000 --> 25:19.000]  need to infiltrate their grips and try to discredit them we need to pose as
[25:19.000 --> 25:25.000]  conspiracy theorists this is a quote because the establishment has no
[25:25.000 --> 25:29.000]  credibility and we need to then pose as the alternative media to cause in
[25:29.000 --> 25:34.000]  fighting and what do you see we post a Ron Paul article we can go check the IP
[25:34.000 --> 25:38.000]  addresses instantly you'll have 20 commenters that are three people with the
[25:38.000 --> 25:42.000]  same IP address spamming everybody hates Ron Paul everybody knows he's a sell
[25:42.000 --> 25:45.000]  out everybody knows he's never done anything good when he has a perfect
[25:45.000 --> 25:49.000]  voting record and as a man of pure honor ran Paul delivering on trying to cut
[25:49.000 --> 25:53.000]  taxes cut the size of government criticizing and trying to stop these
[25:53.000 --> 25:59.000]  new wars total attacks info wars dot com total attacks these are government
[25:59.000 --> 26:04.000]  and corporation financed and funded the it's all over the news the Pentagon has
[26:04.000 --> 26:09.000]  robots and tens of thousands of employees and private groups and in
[26:09.000 --> 26:14.000]  George Soros's groups all just attacking the alternative media trying to create
[26:14.000 --> 26:21.000]  infighting trying to create bedlam and Glenn Beck to be clear from multiple
[26:21.000 --> 26:25.000]  Fox News sources over a month ago the word was he would be gone by the end
[26:25.000 --> 26:30.000]  of the year and we laid hints out here and said that when you saw the New
[26:30.000 --> 26:33.000]  York Times article saying there were rumors we said yes it's going to happen
[26:33.000 --> 26:39.000]  he'll have his own network and Beck overall financially will do better
[26:39.000 --> 26:45.000]  running his own system I don't think overall he will garner the same
[26:45.000 --> 26:51.000]  audiences because when he's actually Internet only or predominantly Internet
[26:51.000 --> 26:57.000]  in his other ventures outside radio he says he's going to target a young
[26:57.000 --> 27:02.000]  audience ladies and gentlemen Glenn Beck does not sell to young audiences
[27:02.000 --> 27:07.000]  young audiences want things that are real young audiences will watch an 80 year
[27:07.000 --> 27:11.000]  old man if he's got real information young audiences will watch a 12 year old
[27:11.000 --> 27:15.000]  if they've got good information and they'll talk about 9-11 being an inside
[27:15.000 --> 27:19.000]  job they'll talk about government sponsored media they'll talk about real
[27:19.000 --> 27:23.000]  issues will talk about the real issues that's where it's all that and Glenn
[27:23.000 --> 27:28.000]  Beck might have been shocking to the Fox News audience predominantly in a coma
[27:28.000 --> 27:34.000]  but it's not going to be something new it's going to be quite old and tired to
[27:34.000 --> 27:38.000]  the audiences he's going to try to target and unless he gets really hardcore
[27:38.000 --> 27:42.000]  and really starts telling it like it is he's going to just kind of fade off
[27:42.000 --> 27:48.000]  but if he does come out and tell the truth if Fox News was suppressing him
[27:48.000 --> 27:52.000]  and there's some reports of that then he will explode and they will come after
[27:52.000 --> 27:56.000]  him even more like they're coming after us but interestingly enough you notice
[27:56.000 --> 27:59.000]  when I was on the view Bill O'Reilly played the clip and said well it's a
[27:59.000 --> 28:02.000]  talk show host but nobody knows who he is wouldn't say my name and they all
[28:02.000 --> 28:06.000]  laughed at the table all knowing full well who I am
[28:06.000 --> 28:09.000]  you notice the New York Times when they write articles about our reports will
[28:09.000 --> 28:13.000]  not say they'll just say a radio talk show host well yesterday Fox News ran a
[28:13.000 --> 28:22.000]  report about as CNN did as MSNBC Politico literally dozens and dozens of
[28:22.000 --> 28:27.000]  major reports linking to InfoWars.com and Ron Paul's announcement that he'd be
[28:27.000 --> 28:31.000]  announcing in the next month for president Fox News took whole quotes out of
[28:31.000 --> 28:38.000]  the interview and said on the radio show Ron Paul said now why does Fox have a
[28:38.000 --> 28:44.000]  rule to never say my name because they're scared we could damage Fox News if
[28:44.000 --> 28:48.000]  we wanted to a lot more than media matters us because media matters as
[28:48.000 --> 28:52.000]  Cass Sunstein admitted is seen as establishment and has no credibility
[28:52.000 --> 28:56.000]  with the general public who've woken up the left-right paradigm but when we
[28:56.000 --> 29:00.000]  point out that for a decade Fox News said there was no world government
[29:00.000 --> 29:05.000]  no move to set this up and now it's all happening we forced them to tell some
[29:05.000 --> 29:09.000]  of the truth just to have any credibility and to stay in the game at any level
[29:09.000 --> 29:15.000]  and so Fox is scared to death of InfoWars.com they're scared to death
[29:15.000 --> 29:23.000]  of PrisonPlanet.com because as the top radio consultants were quoted in the
[29:23.000 --> 29:29.000]  cover story and talkers magazine last month Alex Jones when the history books
[29:29.000 --> 29:34.000]  are written will be known as the independent media trailblazer of the
[29:34.000 --> 29:39.000]  21st century that's why talkers in front of the heads of clear channel the heads of
[29:39.000 --> 29:43.000]  all the major networks I'm the keynote speaker in June that's why they're
[29:43.000 --> 29:47.000]  summoning me there because they want to fully understand this you understand
[29:47.000 --> 29:51.000]  what we've done together is shaking the foundations of the system we're on the

[33:55.000 --> 34:00.000]  alternative approaches to issue talk programming on terrestrial radio outside
[34:00.000 --> 34:10.000]  rigid partisan formats story and MMS agenda highlights on page one now I'll
[34:10.000 --> 34:14.000]  be quite frank with you there are no consultants here there are no advisors
[34:14.000 --> 34:19.000]  to Alex Jones I'm a guy who literally a lot of the times takes out the trash
[34:19.000 --> 34:24.000]  around here I have a great grassroots crew that I've trained I normally hire
[34:24.000 --> 34:28.000]  people just out of Craigslist ads who don't even know who I am so they can see
[34:28.000 --> 34:32.000]  the information for themselves this is not a group of acolytes that are here
[34:32.000 --> 34:38.000]  just agreeing with me with one one hundredth of the money that Fox News has
[34:38.000 --> 34:44.000]  we have produced an outlet that is beating their pants off absolutely
[34:44.000 --> 34:50.000]  destroying them and other mainstream media on the internet and now blasting
[34:50.000 --> 34:54.000]  into the AM and FM dial gaining upwards of three to four new affiliates on big
[34:54.000 --> 35:00.000]  stations a week and getting high ratings we get high ratings for little stations
[35:00.000 --> 35:04.000]  that don't even show up we get even bigger ratings for big stations and it's
[35:04.000 --> 35:09.000]  so much of what we've talked about for 16 years has now come true has now
[35:09.000 --> 35:16.000]  happened has now basically unfolded that the system is beginning to panic
[35:16.000 --> 35:21.000]  they're scared and so they're moving in with a constellation of attacks a
[35:21.000 --> 35:26.000]  a cornucopia of attacks to try to sabotage the alternative media now
[35:26.000 --> 35:32.000]  George Soros in media matters that he funds sees Fox News as alternative to
[35:32.000 --> 35:35.000]  what to their globalist liberal agenda when it's just a different flavor of
[35:35.000 --> 35:39.000]  globalism and what did they say in internal memos that came out two weeks
[35:39.000 --> 35:44.000]  we're gonna sabotage them we're gonna destroy them we're going into a new
[35:44.000 --> 35:48.000]  phase what's always been their face posing as a nonpartisan watchdog a
[35:48.000 --> 35:53.000]  savage group funded by a man who openly has imploded currencies worldwide
[35:53.000 --> 35:58.000]  been convicted a man who admitted to 60 minutes he helped the Nazis round
[35:58.000 --> 36:02.000]  people up and take their wealth and then if you criticize that he has
[36:02.000 --> 36:06.000]  financed Jewish groups that he runs come out and say basically that you're
[36:06.000 --> 36:11.000]  some type of Nazi because you don't like Nazi supporters this is the
[36:11.000 --> 36:18.000]  Bizarro world of George Soros just one power minion of the New World Order one
[36:18.000 --> 36:23.000]  Bilderberg group Davos Confab globalist and here's the headline of American
[36:23.000 --> 36:27.000]  Free Press Soros convenes Britain Woods to we're gonna be breaking that down
[36:27.000 --> 36:32.000]  but again the alternative media the Internet itself is being chopped up
[36:32.000 --> 36:36.000]  right now is being attacked because on the level playing field we are
[36:36.000 --> 36:41.000]  defeating the globalist in the realm of ideas we are gaining ground on them
[36:41.000 --> 36:46.000]  every day and they can feel the strength draining out of them they're not
[36:46.000 --> 36:51.000]  gonna give up power easily they are coming after all of us from below with
[36:51.000 --> 36:56.000]  the Cointel Pro from above with the national media with the think tanks
[36:56.000 --> 37:00.000]  with the government funded media government funded media is now hiding
[37:00.000 --> 37:06.000]  in plain view you think MPR is the only one getting government money most of
[37:06.000 --> 37:10.000]  the mainstream media is getting government money and private Federal Reserve
[37:10.000 --> 37:18.000]  taxpayer money they take from us under the table now public that is the
[37:18.000 --> 37:28.000]  tale tale logo of a real tyranny so all of this is happening and no matter
[37:28.000 --> 37:32.000]  what political party is in power the federalization of police the spy
[37:32.000 --> 37:38.000]  grids the tattletail squads it only intensifies because they know as the
[37:38.000 --> 37:44.000]  economy melts down as the standard of living slides into the great abyss
[37:44.000 --> 37:48.000]  people are gonna wake up they're gonna start looking for answers and the
[37:48.000 --> 37:52.000]  globalist can't have a strong alternative media or even Glenn Beck telling
[37:52.000 --> 37:56.000]  part of the truth on Fox News while that's happening and the deal is the
[37:56.000 --> 38:00.000]  Soros crowd gets rid of Oberman Fox gets rid of Beck because they're going
[38:00.000 --> 38:05.000]  to try to lower the rhetoric just as Chuck E. Schumer is on record saying
[38:05.000 --> 38:10.000]  that well he could get Boehner to make deals and keep expanding the size of
[38:10.000 --> 38:16.000]  it if it wasn't for that Tea Party basically forcing him to cut government
[38:16.000 --> 38:20.000]  they want to get in there they want to share power they want to make deals
[38:20.000 --> 38:25.000]  the Republicans want to get back in the central banks have a policy of wanting
[38:25.000 --> 38:29.000]  to implode economies so that they can take them over for pennies on the
[38:29.000 --> 38:34.000]  dollar this is all happening we're deep into this right now and those of us
[38:34.000 --> 38:39.000]  that saw it coming a long time ago made preparations to resist it made
[38:39.000 --> 38:44.000]  preparations to get on every radio interview we could every TV interview
[38:44.000 --> 38:48.000]  we could to be ridiculed knowing that as we laid out the truth and as it
[38:48.000 --> 38:55.000]  happened our credibility would rise and so billions of people around the
[38:55.000 --> 38:59.000]  world have heard my shelf and countless other patriots calling into
[38:59.000 --> 39:03.000]  shows being guessed on shows I quit counting more than six seven years
[39:03.000 --> 39:07.000]  ago it was over 3000 radio interviews I've done then many of them giant
[39:07.000 --> 39:11.000]  broadcast I've done thousands and thousands and thousands of radio
[39:11.000 --> 39:16.000]  interviews hundreds and hundreds of TV interviews thousands and thousands
[39:16.000 --> 39:22.000]  of my own broadcast 26 plus documentaries all of that is evergreen you see
[39:22.000 --> 39:26.000]  something I did 10 years ago people think it was taped last week people see
[39:26.000 --> 39:30.000]  my films I release more than a decade ago they're getting more popular not less
[39:30.000 --> 39:35.000]  popular because it's evergreen you watch a bill O'Reilly from 10 years ago
[39:35.000 --> 39:40.000]  watchable it's whatever fluff and fake political infighting was going on
[39:40.000 --> 39:47.000]  from that day see they fire a salvo of lies it only goes out once when we
[39:47.000 --> 39:51.000]  put out the truth it bounces around ricocheting forever and I'm just
[39:51.000 --> 39:55.000]  sitting here at a giant 50 cal machine gun aimed at the new world order and
[39:55.000 --> 40:01.000]  it and every bullet I fire bounces around inside of them forever and that's
[40:01.000 --> 40:05.000]  the good news we've already put out so much info we've already discredited
[40:05.000 --> 40:09.000]  these criminals so hardcore we've already told the truth and exposed their
[40:09.000 --> 40:13.000]  paradigm and their tricks and their blueprint and their playbooks and their
[40:13.000 --> 40:17.000]  program of societal disintegration to build on its ashes a planetary
[40:17.000 --> 40:22.000]  dictatorship of the bankers that even if they shut me down tomorrow even if
[40:22.000 --> 40:25.000]  they shut Glenn Beck down tomorrow even if they shut G. Eber Griffin down
[40:25.000 --> 40:31.000]  tomorrow even if they shut down Bob Chapman tomorrow they have all already
[40:31.000 --> 40:35.000]  failed the question is are we going to have to go through a lot more pain
[40:35.000 --> 40:42.000]  before we reverse this the mere act of them trying to move in with EAS federal
[40:42.000 --> 40:46.000]  takeover of media the expansion of behind the scenes private Federal Reserve
[40:46.000 --> 40:52.000]  payoffs in media shows their desperation so this shows under attack media
[40:52.000 --> 40:55.000]  matters said two weeks ago we can have a go they said we're going after Fox
[40:55.000 --> 40:59.000]  News and a list of conservative and libertarian sites and then you they
[40:59.000 --> 41:02.000]  didn't list those sites but you go to their site you see who they're attacking
[41:02.000 --> 41:07.000]  on an almost daily basis they attacked me twice yesterday it's yours truly they
[41:07.000 --> 41:11.000]  put out reports six months ago saying Alex Jones and Glenn Beck are going to
[41:11.000 --> 41:16.000]  cause a new Oklahoma City Beck finally took my warning saw the White House
[41:16.000 --> 41:22.000]  advisors saying boy a new terror attack would sure help us and he went on air
[41:22.000 --> 41:26.000]  and said they're preparing a new Oklahoma City to blame me he left Alex Jones
[41:26.000 --> 41:31.000]  out of it no Glenn in those reports they were saying you and I cause that
[41:31.000 --> 41:37.000]  attempted shooter in San Francisco that you and I along with Ron Paul cause the
[41:37.000 --> 41:41.000]  Gifford shooting that you and I were going to cause the new Oklahoma City
[41:41.000 --> 41:46.000]  because even though you've proven yourself to be a thespian Shakespearean
[41:46.000 --> 41:50.000]  actor of great skill even though you are like a chameleon and I don't trust you
[41:50.000 --> 41:55.000]  the fact that you understood the market share out there in telling the truth
[41:55.000 --> 42:01.000]  about the New World Order and went 50% of the way made you a superstar because
[42:01.000 --> 42:05.000]  the globalist thought they could control this movement but now it's backfired on
[42:05.000 --> 42:11.000]  them you just added credibility to people like me with the mainstream dumb
[42:11.000 --> 42:15.000]  down crowd now we don't really even need them because they're a bunch of couch
[42:15.000 --> 42:20.000]  potatoes who don't act we want the young people we want the military we want
[42:20.000 --> 42:25.000]  the police we want people in government to wake up we want people that are out
[42:25.000 --> 42:31.000]  there in the system and we're reaching them and we're going to win this war
[42:31.000 --> 42:37.000]  agents of liberty sons and daughters of liberty don't have to follow orders from
[42:37.000 --> 42:40.000]  headquarters they've rediscovered what it is to be free they've rediscovered
[42:40.000 --> 42:44.000]  history they've rediscovered the foundations of what make a nation of
[42:44.000 --> 42:52.000]  people great and ideas are bulletproof to use a line from V for vendetta you
[42:52.000 --> 42:57.000]  think you can stop flesh and blood you can but you can't stop an idea and at
[42:57.000 --> 43:02.000]  the globalist physically kill me or imprison me or set me up that will only
[43:02.000 --> 43:07.000]  intensify our credibility so instead they're trying to assassinate my
[43:07.000 --> 43:12.000]  character assassinate who I am misconstrue things out of context to make me
[43:12.000 --> 43:17.000]  look like a cook whether it's media matters or glenbeck it's the same tactic
[43:17.000 --> 43:23.000]  but media matters and the New York magazine and Rolling Stone and
[43:23.000 --> 43:27.000]  Nightline and MSNBC and all the and and and discovery channel and history
[43:27.000 --> 43:33.000]  channel and all their attack pieces in BBC you still are blind to what's
[43:33.000 --> 43:39.000]  hiding in plain view you have lost all of your credibility with anyone who can
[43:39.000 --> 43:43.000]  think for themselves as Cass Sunstein admitted two and a half years ago in
[43:43.000 --> 43:51.000]  those internal memos that are public and his public papers as I told Politico
[43:51.000 --> 43:56.000]  as I told Salon last year during the Republican primary in Kentucky they
[43:56.000 --> 44:00.000]  said every time he's attacked his ratings go up Rand Paul and I said that's
[44:00.000 --> 44:03.000]  right the only way for you to defeat Rand Paul but you can't because you're
[44:03.000 --> 44:10.000]  too arrogant is to endorse him if you endorse him he will lose credibility
[44:10.000 --> 44:14.000]  but that still won't defeat him because he'll only lose credibility with
[44:14.000 --> 44:18.000]  weak-minded who know enough to not trust you so because they don't trust you
[44:18.000 --> 44:22.000]  they won't trust Rand the thinkers even if you did that sophisticated attack
[44:22.000 --> 44:27.000]  would understand Rand's real record and so Bill Clinton went to campaign
[44:27.000 --> 44:33.000]  against him he got about eight points in the polls on top of his lead of
[44:33.000 --> 44:40.000]  six percent see you kill me it underlines and highlights everything I've said
[44:40.000 --> 44:46.000]  and done you try to assassinate my character I'm a pretty boring guy there
[44:46.000 --> 44:54.000]  are no skeletons you invent them it won't work it's the seal of approval when
[44:54.000 --> 44:59.000]  you attack someone what do you got left in your kitty what do you got left in
[44:59.000 --> 45:04.000]  that hole that ace stage terror false flags on the internet fear mongering
[45:04.000 --> 45:10.000]  about 160 buried Al Qaeda nukes in the US more fake anthrax attacks new wars
[45:10.000 --> 45:15.000]  financial implosion posing as the savior but you could have done that a
[45:15.000 --> 45:19.000]  decade ago but now people know about the Federal Reserve now people know about
[45:19.000 --> 45:24.000]  the new world order now people are looking past the Republican and Democratic
[45:24.000 --> 45:28.000]  figureheads that are only fighting over who gets the levers of control to the
[45:28.000 --> 45:32.000]  private Federal Reserve financing the corporate media on both the left and
[45:32.000 --> 45:38.000]  right under the table of taxpayer money it's coming out in the London Guardian
[45:38.000 --> 45:43.000]  Bloomberg AP doesn't become a big news cycle issue but it comes out oh yeah
[45:43.000 --> 45:50.000]  370 plus billion laundered by Wacovia and Wells Fargo of cocaine and heroin
[45:50.000 --> 45:55.000]  money out of Mexico they even were running the aircraft credibility lost
[45:55.000 --> 46:08.000]  credibility destroyed you understand what's happening
[46:08.000 --> 46:12.000]  you understand people know that the government 12 years ago signed a deal to
[46:12.000 --> 46:16.000]  all the military veterans death benefits when they died and cheat their
[46:16.000 --> 46:19.000]  widows and widowers out of it you understand it's now in Texas
[46:19.000 --> 46:23.000]  newspapers that the government is covering up radioactive isotopes in the
[46:23.000 --> 46:29.000]  water that by the way are added to the water you understand that yes the
[46:29.000 --> 46:34.000]  things I talk about sound completely nuts and crazy so does Hitler murdering
[46:34.000 --> 46:38.000]  people in mass but it happened so does Stalin murdering people in mass or
[46:38.000 --> 46:43.000]  killing more than 60 million history is crazy history is wild history is
[46:43.000 --> 46:51.000]  unbelievably strange truth is stranger than fiction but you have failed you
[46:51.000 --> 46:57.000]  have failed big time because once people admit that there's corruption and
[46:57.000 --> 47:01.000]  evil in their government and in the big mega corporations becoming fat off
[47:01.000 --> 47:05.000]  that government as Thomas Jefferson said if we ever allow private central
[47:05.000 --> 47:08.000]  banks to control the issuance of currency and credit a group of
[47:08.000 --> 47:13.000]  corporations will grow up around them that will turn our future progeny into
[47:13.000 --> 47:19.000]  nothing but slaves another quote central banks are more dangerous than
[47:19.000 --> 47:29.000]  standing armies if you allow them to be established our ancestors what's the
[47:29.000 --> 47:33.000]  exact quote guys we pull the exact Thomas Jefferson quote up about banks are
[47:33.000 --> 47:36.000]  more dangerous than standing armies if you ever allow them to grow up in the
[47:36.000 --> 47:40.000]  country our children will wake up homeless on the continent their forefathers
[47:40.000 --> 47:44.000]  conquered there you go and there's countless variants of that quote from
[47:44.000 --> 47:49.000]  Jefferson and Washington and Franklin and Patrick Henry and Thomas Payne
[47:49.000 --> 47:58.000]  that we're fighting the same fight that they fought 200 plus years ago we're
[47:58.000 --> 48:02.000]  fighting the same fight that Andrew Jackson fought we're fighting the same
[48:02.000 --> 48:07.000]  fight and the system tried with Glenn Beck to come out and pose as a true
[48:07.000 --> 48:11.000]  anti-New World Order person to then gain the credibility of the giant movement
[48:11.000 --> 48:17.000]  they see growing and it didn't work it only got more out of hand and so now
[48:17.000 --> 48:23.000]  they've chopped his head off at Fox and now they're going to try to move against
[48:23.000 --> 48:26.000]  the alternative media now they're going to unleash media matters to try to
[48:26.000 --> 48:30.000]  savage yours truly are you going to stand with us do you realize what a war
[48:30.000 --> 48:34.000]  this is do you realize what a fight this is do you realize that you this
[48:34.000 --> 48:39.000]  alternative media and the internet is your media your internet your voice
[48:39.000 --> 48:44.000]  your megaphone your future as bad as talk radio is with neocon fear mongering
[48:44.000 --> 48:48.000]  about Muslims and how great torture is all day it still has a lot of local
[48:48.000 --> 48:52.000]  programs that are popular and tell the truth about the New World Order and our
[48:52.000 --> 48:58.000]  ideas are gaining ground and getting on more and more stations the system knows
[48:58.000 --> 49:02.000]  that they're in trouble the system knows this is happening they know you can
[49:02.000 --> 49:06.000]  call into talk radio they know that local news stories of corruption can get
[49:06.000 --> 49:12.000]  out on talk radio local TV is almost completely controlled talk radio is
[49:12.000 --> 49:16.000]  mainly people that grew up into media on their own and weren't trained how to be
[49:16.000 --> 49:20.000]  brainwashed repeaters who just regurgitate whatever the corporate and
[49:20.000 --> 49:23.000]  government systems put out as press releases so they want to shut that down
[49:23.000 --> 49:26.000]  that's why they're openly announcing we want a new fairness doctrine not just
[49:26.000 --> 49:31.000]  over talk radio but the internet we all hang together or we will surely hang
[49:31.000 --> 49:34.000]  separate they did find the Thomas Jefferson quote please put it back on
[49:34.000 --> 49:40.000]  the telescreen there I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous
[49:40.000 --> 49:43.000]  to our liberties than standing armies of the American people ever allow private
[49:43.000 --> 49:47.000]  banks to control the issuance of their currency first by inflation then by
[49:47.000 --> 49:50.000]  deflation the banks of corporations that will grow up around the banks will
[49:50.000 --> 49:54.000]  deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the
[49:54.000 --> 49:58.000]  continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the
[49:58.000 --> 50:05.000]  banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs and he said that
[50:05.000 --> 50:09.000]  during the revolutionary war that war was about getting rid of the bank of
[50:09.000 --> 50:13.000]  England that war was about getting rid of the money changers that war was about
[50:13.000 --> 50:18.000]  getting rid of that tiny ultra rich class that used government to shut down all
[50:18.000 --> 50:21.000]  their competition under the Queen of England or King George the third at the

[52:08.000 --> 52:12.000]  could be caused by hyperinflation that will soon hit the United States and
[52:12.000 --> 52:16.000]  could lead to millions of Americans becoming homeless all caused by the

[54:19.000 --> 54:24.000]  by the Anglo-American banking cartel is now in full swing they plan to build
[54:24.000 --> 54:29.000]  a open tyranny privately run by the banks openly they will come from
[54:29.000 --> 54:32.000]  behind the throne to the front of the throne and be given the crown and the
[54:32.000 --> 54:38.000]  scepter of world tyranny it's on it's now happening we're going to be talking
[54:38.000 --> 54:41.000]  a little arousia about that coming up for a full hour and for prison planet dot
[54:41.000 --> 54:46.000]  tv viewers are able to see him there from their media center for radio

[54:58.000 --> 55:02.000]  XM info wars dot com prison planet dot com obviously I covered this at the
[55:02.000 --> 55:06.000]  start of the show we'll get more into it with Linda LaRouge after we get into
[55:06.000 --> 55:10.000]  the financial collapse that's happening strong earthquake first it was a
[55:10.000 --> 55:15.000]  7.4 downgrade to a 7.1 happened a few hours ago off the east coast of Japan
[55:15.000 --> 55:19.000]  it sent in a meter tall tsunami but didn't cause any serious damage they're
[55:19.000 --> 55:24.000]  saying so that's being reported on right now another earthquake a shook
[55:24.000 --> 55:29.000]  southern and central Mexico a 6.5 so a lot of tectonic activity certainly
[55:29.000 --> 55:37.000]  increasing right now also the more serious news for me out of the stacks
[55:37.000 --> 55:42.000]  of news we have that are also up on the websites Japan considers wider nuclear
[55:42.000 --> 55:50.000]  evacuation zone and they're talking about pushing it far past the two
[55:50.000 --> 55:54.000]  prefectures that surround Fukushima because they're picking up even higher
[55:54.000 --> 56:00.000]  levels of milly sieverts further away than they previously were and our
[56:00.000 --> 56:04.000]  government is openly saying the FDA has announced they're going to raise the
[56:04.000 --> 56:09.000]  level of what they say safe radiation is because of radioactive iodine and
[56:09.000 --> 56:14.000]  other isotopes being picked up in milk and other food products on the west
[56:14.000 --> 56:20.000]  coast directly in line the prevailing winds from Mexico Korea is taking it
[56:20.000 --> 56:24.000]  very serious South Korea shuts down schools amid Japan radiation fears
[56:24.000 --> 56:30.000]  that's out of MSNBC New York restaurants are using radiation detectors on
[56:30.000 --> 56:34.000]  fish from the Pacific that's just some of the news we have on that front will
[56:34.000 --> 56:41.000]  continue to cover it also we're going to get into the CNBC report with
[56:41.000 --> 56:46.000]  lonely Rose coming up US going same route as Greece Portugal says top
[56:46.000 --> 56:52.000]  economist also we're going to get into Ron Paul openly two days ago saying
[56:52.000 --> 56:55.000]  that he'll probably announce these running for president in the next month
[56:55.000 --> 57:01.000]  of that here on this broadcast getting a lot of media coverage and the
[57:01.000 --> 57:05.000]  support for Ron Paul is meteoric compared to the massive support he saw
[57:05.000 --> 57:10.000]  on record fundraising two and a half three years ago so that is coming up
[57:10.000 --> 57:14.000]  as well today and then after Mr. LaRouge leaves us I'm going to get into
[57:14.000 --> 57:19.000]  this AP article because I've seen this curious development the last decade
[57:19.000 --> 57:23.000]  especially in Ohio I've seen multiple reports out of Ohio that they'll have
[57:23.000 --> 57:28.000]  police dogs in a police car dog or dogs they'll leave the window down the dog
[57:28.000 --> 57:33.000]  will jump out try to attack bark at you growl if you yell back at it you go
[57:33.000 --> 57:38.000]  to jail because the dog is better than you a lowly surf piece of trash just
[57:38.000 --> 57:41.000]  like TSA sticking their hands down your pants putting you in radiation
[57:41.000 --> 57:48.000]  bakers the naked body scanners it's about training you that you have no rights
[57:48.000 --> 57:52.000]  and it says police say an Ohio man has been charged with a misdemeanor for
[57:52.000 --> 57:58.000]  barking at a police dog the 25-year-old Ryan James Stevens was charged with
[57:58.000 --> 58:03.000]  teasing a police dog in Cincinnati suburb the man says the dog barked and
[58:03.000 --> 58:08.000]  growled at him first officer Bradley Walker wrote that he heard a canine dog
[58:08.000 --> 58:11.000]  barking uncontrollably inside his patrol car while he was investigating a car
[58:11.000 --> 58:16.000]  crash at a bar early Sunday morning Walker says Stevens was making barking
[58:16.000 --> 58:19.000]  noises and hissing at the animal Walker reported that Stevens said the dog
[58:19.000 --> 58:27.000]  started it by barking at him so there you go you don't talk not just to a police
[58:27.000 --> 58:33.000]  officer an enforcer of the Imperium but to their holy dogs remember that scum
[58:33.000 --> 58:37.000]  remember that slaves you're here to pay money the private federal reserve so they
[58:37.000 --> 58:41.000]  can buy off the media you're here to lick boots
[58:41.000 --> 58:51.000]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network this is Alex Jones with
[58:51.000 --> 58:55.000]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[58:55.000 --> 58:59.000]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[58:59.000 --> 59:03.000]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[59:03.000 --> 59:07.000]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[59:07.000 --> 59:12.000]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of
[59:12.000 --> 59:15.000]  the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[59:15.000 --> 59:19.000]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[59:19.000 --> 59:23.000]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[59:23.000 --> 59:27.000]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar
[59:27.000 --> 59:31.000]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[59:31.000 --> 59:34.000]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[59:34.000 --> 59:40.000]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[59:40.000 --> 59:45.000]  that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to

[59:50.000 --> 01:00:01.000]  Waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:11.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:18.000]  well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.000]  Austin Texas Alex Jones
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:35.000]  well we're now joined for his maiden visit with us by Lemon LaRouche it
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:41.000]  doesn't really need any introduction he's been involved for decades since the
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  1960s in political movements here in the United States known as the LaRouche
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:54.000]  movement and he's also run for president seeking the Democratic Party
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  nomination LaRouche PAC.com he's with us for the next hour I believe and we're
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:09.000]  going to cover the field here first his analysis of 30 plus years ago of the
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:14.000]  banking cartel leading towards hyperinflation now in full collapse and
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.000]  then we're going to get into the fact that there was forecasting of these
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000]  earthquakes but the government shut down those satellite programs to be able to
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:26.000]  forecast when earthquakes are coming what he sees happening with these wars in
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  the Middle East being orchestrated by the Anglo-American establishment as part
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  of a destabilization program the government shut down all of it this is a
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:39.000]  short segment long segment coming up in the next break but Lemon LaRouche it's
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:43.000]  great to have you on with us today just giving us a preview of some of what you
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  you want to discuss today I've got my question certainly but in the three
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  minutes we've got left in this segment give us a little preview of what you
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  want to get into well first of all we have a right now we have the shutting
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  down of the government is taking a crate and this is an operation it's a dirty
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  operation is complex that we have more and more we were now in a period of
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  increasing numbers of earthquakes and intensity of earthquakes which will
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.000]  probably be going on for the next few years it's only all the coastal areas
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  of relevance as some other areas but largely in the ocean areas or on the
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:27.000]  bridges of oceans at the same time the entire US system and the world system
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:32.000]  at least in the transatlantic region is in a process of current breakdown this
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  is not something eventual this is something which is already ongoing
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:40.000]  and the shutting down of the government of the United States at least that's
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  what's threatened to be carried out right now is part of the operation
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  well it looks like shock therapy where they don't blame the big central
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  banks for the thousand plus trillion derivatives they make it all about
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:00.000]  welfare programs and things which people could debate you know make people
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.000]  dependent but regardless that's just rearranging chairs on the Titanic isn't
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  it was worse than that that we most of this bailout money which was bailout
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  since 2008 was a complete fraud this is gambling debts and we are the US
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  government is being asked to pay gambling debts and shutting down the
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:26.000]  economy essentially and shutting down our people essentially in order to pay
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:33.000]  gambling debts now a Glass-Steagall law of the 1933 law re-enacted would
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  change that we would then have some trillions of dollars of credit available
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:44.000]  freed up from this garbage in which to get the economy functioning again
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  in Europe Europe is in a process of breakdown right now the entire Euro
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  system we have two bad bank systems you have the Euro system is a bad bank
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  you take all the assets you want to get rid of you dump them into a bad bank
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  you take the bad bank get rid of the problem the brick system in which the
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  Russia is involved also a bad bank by shutting putting all the assets you want
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  to get rid of in a bad bank because there are any gambling assets you
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:18.000]  therefore get rid of those what comes out of that well Jacob Rothschild's
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:23.000]  interoffer bank hopes to take over the world so simple and our politics in
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  the United States in the Western Hemisphere and mostly a transit like
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:31.000]  region it's controlled by these people let him a ruch is our guest long
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:35.000]  segment coming up I want you to start back over and recap what you just said
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  go over some of the history of this what their goals are the technicals of it
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:43.000]  and your forecast for what we're going to see coming up here in the next few
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:48.000]  months and years and how the establishment is going to try to take us through
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  this crisis and gain total power and how we can reverse that and grab victory
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.000]  from the jaws of defeat Lenin LaRouche is our guest LaRouche pack dot com

[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.000]  I'm not here to scare you but when disaster strikes you won't have time to
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.000]  think you must act automatically what does the pilot do when the helicopter
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:25.000]  engine fails in flight no time to think just act automatically when the alert

[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:20.000]  connection from their headquarters with linden larouche of larouche pack dot
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:27.000]  com linden i want to get into your forty years or so of diagnosing the global
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:32.000]  banking cartel the rockefeller's the Rothschild's their plan their stated
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:38.000]  plan to get the world basically into debt to get the planet to sign on to these
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:43.000]  fraudulent debts and then on the ashes of that to basically bring the world into
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:47.000]  debt slavery their own statements from the u n the head of the goddard space
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:52.000]  center the white house science are john p holdren to have a quote post
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:57.000]  industrial world now when i woke up eighteen nineteen years ago doing my
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  own research into the globalist i discovered the same documents the same
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.000]  statements then i found later your work that have been going on for decades
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:10.000]  before accurately breaking down just exactly what their plan was a
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:16.000]  malthusian new dark age to shut down development to shut down any competition
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:21.000]  to their hegemonic rules so briefly sir for those that don't know who you are
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:25.000]  or who have heard the media describe who you are in your own words what is
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:30.000]  larouche a pack who is linden larouche and then let's get into our foe the
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:35.000]  globalist the program where we are now what their plan is and how we can
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.000]  counter them because everything you talked about thirty forty years ago
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:44.000]  we're now at that point we're now entering that prime zone all the other great
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:49.000]  staged events of the past were only preludes to it linden larouche
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:54.000]  well i was forced a frank and roosevelt man from the time of military service
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:10:00.000]  during world war two and i came back to the united states said from overseas
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.000]  that you find that the everything had changed under truman as compared to
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:10.000]  roosevelt now truman was a stooge actually for wisdom churchhood company
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:15.000]  and during this period there's been a seesaw battle between the american
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:22.000]  patriot and those who prefer the british system the british system is not
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:27.000]  what most people think it is it actually is a continuation of a roman empire
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:32.000]  based on the concept of monetarism in other words it's not the really
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:38.000]  colonies it's monetarism whereas we in our system establish a credit system
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  not a monetarist system our credit system which in which our dollar as
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:50.000]  offered was used to finance projects which were worthwhile for us and for
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:56.000]  other purposes of our nation whereas in europe has still been under the same
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:01.000]  old system of monetarist rule which has actually been a heritage of europe
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:06.000]  since the roman empire so the problem struggle has been and we came over
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:13.000]  here to establish a nation here during the beginning of the 17th century on
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:18.000]  the on the assumption that we had to have a separate place to bring the best of
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:23.000]  european civilization into a new territory the americas and to build up
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:29.000]  here a form of nation state which was opposite to the british empire and
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:35.000]  similar kinds of imperial ideas that we have been in a continuous war since
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  that time since our revolution and even before that since 1763 we've been in a
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  continuous war against this imperialism and we unfortunately when you talk about
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:52.000]  Wall Street or the Boston banks you're talking about really a branch of the
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:57.000]  british empire and right now you see we're being destroyed through the
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:03.000]  federal reserve system which is now a creature of the british empire we are
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:08.000]  with tens of trillions of dollars of worthless debt these are gambling debts
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:13.000]  this is a legitimate debt isn't it isn't it really i mean to boil it down in
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  layman's terms a form of neo feudalistic serfdom their entire stated goal if you
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  read what the founder said if you read what other presidents this was always
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:30.000]  the fight it was about this monetarism where they use debt in a debt black hole
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:35.000]  system that's impossible to ever pay back that they create out of nothing to
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  make us basically sharecroppers or debt slaves well that's it says it's true
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:46.000]  i would have an explanation of what this is a little more complicated but
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:51.000]  that's essentially true okay continuing we're getting into derivatives and what
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:56.000]  happened in 99 the end of glass steagle i mean i had many economists on at the
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  time that said this is going to create hundreds of trillions in debt it's going
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:04.000]  to allow this inner coterie to take over them and they implode it they're going
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.000]  to roll out their new global currency exactly that is now happening well
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.000]  what you what you have to look at is look at the assassination of john of
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:17.000]  kennedy kennedy together with douglas mcconnthor and others were opposed to
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:22.000]  the united states being engaged in a war in indochina the thing was we are not
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:27.000]  going to fight a land war in asia a protracted land war in asia now the
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  kennedy stuck stuck to this guns on this and the guns came after him they
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:38.000]  killed him now what his his successor was not bad a bad person but he was
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:43.000]  scared is the devil johnson and therefore johnson went along with the war
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:48.000]  which kennedy would have opposed had he lived then you had the kennedy's
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:54.000]  brother robert was about to be nominated as president of our democratic ticket
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:00.000]  and he was killed and then we got a new process in which these british system
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  took over we had 1968 the change in the financial system we had 1971 the
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  british empire replaces the dollar and we've been looted ever since then we
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  had the 68ers who were actually an anarchist fascist movement and i saw
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:23.000]  these guys first hand they were a fascist movement and that tendency
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:28.000]  typified by mark rodin got put in columbia and elsewhere has taken over
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:33.000]  more and more of the control of the baby boomer generation and has shaped the
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:38.000]  destiny of our country so we have been corrupted in by these unrelated
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:44.000]  methods at the same time that in 1971 at the same time we shut down the
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:49.000]  fix exchange rate system the british empire came back in with the inter
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:53.000]  alpha group on a jake of ross health this inter alpha group is what is
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:59.000]  controlling the international monetary financial system of the world today
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:05.000]  what is their in game goal what are we currently witnessing you're looking at
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:10.000]  the face of pure evil you might call it the british empire but you have to say
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  what's wrong about the british empire you say well we know some people from
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:18.000]  britain they're not like that their system is not doesn't have to be like
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:23.000]  that but we find that the monetarist element which is what he was called the
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:27.000]  new venetian party with william of orange and precarious the thing in the
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  britain the black nobility the city of london in london that's part of it
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:38.000]  that's that's part of it continue so this the problem we have is the
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:43.000]  nation part of the world is not in bad shape politically as we are but the
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:47.000]  transatlantic part of the world is in terrible shape now what take the case
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:52.000]  of this shutting down of the government of the united states think of the
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:57.000]  implications of shutting down the government in a fit of peak what should
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:02.000]  be done is putting through the glass steel law immediately that will get
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:08.000]  rid of the trash the tens of trillions of trash money of gambling debts with
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:14.000]  that money released we could restore the functioning of our states now and
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:20.000]  obviously the intention is is to destroy the united states by a europe
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.000]  centered organization which is essentially what we call the british
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:29.000]  emperor and that's what's happening we're being destroyed by an enemy which
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:35.000]  is a london centered financial imperium well linden larouche again joining
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:39.000]  us right now i concur with your analysis of the historical facts i mean when
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:46.000]  you talk about the british coming in and taking over nineteen twenty two
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:52.000]  council on foreign relations openly infiltrating the media setting up this
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.000]  system it's more of a system than you know so much the british themselves
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.000]  but that's where a lot of the powers you were saying is centered but also in
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:05.000]  the continent of europe and i want to go to a quote from thomas jefferson that
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:09.000]  i read the last hour i want to get your take on this quote we can put that up
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:13.000]  on screen i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:17.000]  hard liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:21.000]  banks to control the issuance of their currency first by inflation then by
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.000]  deflation the banks and the corporations that will grow up around the
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.000]  banks will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.000]  homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.000]  taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:41.000]  thomas jefferson so this is the same old fight we were always fighting you
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:45.000]  look at how the same interest take over third world countries it's the exact
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:50.000]  same playbook what you're talking about is public information and the bankers
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:54.000]  now have a problem because more and more people are looking past the puppet
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:58.000]  republican and democrats that are bought and paid for and actually identifying
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:03.000]  the banking cartel and the system is scared
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:07.000]  well actually the original system of the united states which is is the
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:13.000]  constitution the preamble the west constitution contains this conception
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:20.000]  under our system of law the banking system of the gun of the united states is
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:25.000]  a credit system it is not a monetary system now wall street represents and
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:32.000]  what it's like this represents the enemy what has happened in in 1999 you
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:38.000]  had with this influence and federal reserve system we destroyed the
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:44.000]  separation of british controlled banks which is the wall street gang and
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:52.000]  eliminated the the actual banks of our banking system if if we return to our
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:59.000]  banking system we would immediately wipe out wall street because wall street's
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:06.000]  debt is worthless london's debt is worthless but immediately under our
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:12.000]  constitution with the glass teagle act we would restore our control of our
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:17.000]  banks the banks that operated under our laws not wall street in london was
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:22.000]  little aroush is our guest needs no introduction la ruche pack dot com
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:26.000]  i'm alex jones the info wars dot com are going to break when we come back i
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:31.000]  want to look closer at this government shutdown and you give my take on it
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:35.000]  briefly and then see if little aroush concurs but it's really very simple you
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:39.000]  can debate the unions and corruption you can debate welfare and people being
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:43.000]  dependent but if you look at the real so-called debts that is a very small
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:47.000]  part of it so that's being scapegoated as the solution which really just
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:52.000]  becomes austerity the taxes go up the bankers get more the burning made off
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:57.000]  can lay types run away to lord roth child making trillions of dollars when
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:03.000]  they're the problem will be right back gold isn't for you ted anderson
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:06.000]  president of mitis resources one of the world's premier gold and precious
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:10.000]  metal investing firms i get it you wouldn't buy gold if you believed that
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:14.000]  the government is doing a great job that the fed will stop handing out trillions
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:18.000]  dollars like bailout candy that social security would be there for you that's
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:22.000]  not what's happening you might even pass on gold if the stimulus package
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:26.000]  wouldn't fuel inflation or that the dollar wouldn't lose value or that your
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:30.000]  retirement would be secure if all looks rosy to you then i was not the time to
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:34.000]  buy gold for the realist there have never been more sobering reasons to
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:39.000]  diversify with gold since 2001 the u.s. dollar index has tanked 30% while
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:44.000]  gold has risen 300% right now savvy investors are adding gold to their
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:48.000]  portfolios you should too find out what they know call us and i'll send you
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:52.000]  10 reasons why gold will do very well free eight hundred six eight six two

[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:06.000]  hi this is alex jones the real u.s. unemployment rate is now 22% and not
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:10.000]  nine like what we are told by the mainstream media the primary instinct

[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:27.000]  the head of the roof pack dot com is our guest joining us via video skype from
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:34.000]  his studios island and this is a short segment long segment coming up but the
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:39.000]  corporate media now publicly admittedly funded by the federal reserve with our
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:44.000]  tax money under the table almost all these newspapers mainline TV it's now
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:48.000]  coming out our finance under the table their complete operatives they create
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:53.000]  this fake left-right paradigm to have us fighting with each other and then they
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:25:00.000]  scapegoat capitalism and free market as this British system that you described
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:06.000]  that turns us into debt slaves and their their scapegoating the unions and
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:13.000]  people but then ignoring the banksters how many how many trillions to some
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:19.000]  of us the Washington Post says 650 trillion others say over 1,000 trillion
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:24.000]  some as high as 1,500 trillion of made-up derivatives that they've gotten our
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:28.000]  governments to sign on to and now they're convincing us that it's welfare
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.000]  mom's fault and they're holding everybody hostage with their pensions saying
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:37.000]  too big to fail give us whatever we want or we'll destroy the world markets as
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:41.000]  they destroy the world markets imagine a few people playing the game of
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:48.000]  monopoly and they're playing into infinity with debt they're printing
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:53.000]  this paper money of a monopoly game but then when they close down their
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:58.000]  operation and go home to get drunk what they do is they take all the play
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:04.000]  money which they've created and put it in terms of U.S. dollars and call it
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:11.000]  your debt that's the short answer and they admit they're doing that I saw
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:15.000]  a report a few months ago with the central bank head in Ireland and he said
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:19.000]  it's great to have foreign banks run Ireland sure we don't owe this but
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:23.000]  it's good to be controlled by these people I mean they're just throwing it
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:28.000]  in our face now you're sure of course of course but the eating with the
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:34.000]  crack the crash we're at a point which is a breakdown point we're on the
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:39.000]  urge of two breakdown points one the international at least the transatlantic
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:44.000]  side of the international financial monetary economic system is about the
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:50.000]  crash now not some distant time not in the future it is already crashing when
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:56.000]  the U.S. government is being shut down by a bunch of clowns in the Congress
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.000]  who are going to be the scapegoats for this but who's really shutting it down
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:06.000]  is the Wall Street gang they shut down our government how are we as a nation
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:10.000]  going to function with all the dependencies on government functions if
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:14.000]  we shut down the government you're setting up the government for
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:19.000]  dictatorship at the same time that our whole system is now going bankrupt
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:25.000]  unless we put through Glass Stegel immediately but to get Stegel immediately
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:31.000]  through you must get rid of this president this president is expandable
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:39.000]  under the 25th amendment section four he's insane but he is a British agent
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:44.000]  he is not going to let any necessary legislation get through he's going to use
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:49.000]  his sabotage capability as president to prevent that we're on the edge of the
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:56.000]  crisis right now well sir you know in 2002 when sticklets left the World Bank
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:01.000]  thousands of pages of documents got leaked to Greg Paulist at BBC and in
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  that was the internal reports for the IMF and World Bank do this in third world
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:10.000]  countries they go in get them in false debt implode the economy then shut down
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:14.000]  the government through their agents to further destroy confidence and then they
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:20.000]  come in with a program of austerity posing as the saviors and that's the way
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  the bed bad banking system works you create fake values you put the fake
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:30.000]  values in a bad bank then you collapse the bad bank system and get rid of the
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:35.000]  debt therefore the survivor who does that is supposed to survive the trick here
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:39.000]  is the British are crazy and some people have written or getting wise to this
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:44.000]  that by you try to cut down shut down the world for the sake of the British
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:48.000]  Empire you're going to destroy the British Empire too so the British are going
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:55.000]  to have to learn to do it our way not their way for change well that's what
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:58.000]  the founding of this country was all about for those that have read the
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:03.000]  ethnosium quotes of the founders and if you look at what's happening when we
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:07.000]  come back I want to briefly get into Libya the Middle East the Saudis have
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:10.000]  now run to the Russians and Chinese that's in the Associated Press
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:14.000]  shing the west is double crossing is Gates is meeting with the king of Saudi
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:19.000]  Arabia and the inside baseball is the globalist are implementing all these
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:23.000]  overthrows backing up the rebels and they plan to even bring down Saudi Arabia
[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:28.000]  and other allies then they'll put radical Muslims in and then have another war
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.000]  with them we'll see if you concur with that or your expanded analysis

[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:37.000]  brazinski-esque model from my research through the British divide and
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:43.000]  conquer system what is going on in the Middle East we've got intel that
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:46.000]  they're planning to overthrow the monarchs as well though they are corrupt
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:50.000]  what's part of that larger plan or do you not agree and what do we expect to
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:55.000]  see as the ace in the hole moves by these people as they attempt to
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:00.000]  maneuver rush into this one world government the born again expanded
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:06.000]  British Empire model what you're looking at is the famous mythical story
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:15.000]  about the case of the Zeus and Prometheus that the policy of the empire
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:20.000]  the imperial system in the Mediterranean and spreading out for the
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:26.000]  Mediterranean was always based on this aspect of policy that generated it
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:32.000]  the idea was is to keep the majority of people stupid don't educate them
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:37.000]  keep them as slave and don't let the people become too numerous now as
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:41.000]  you know the world wildlife fund which is an extension of this which is
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:46.000]  of course a British operation says that we will reduce the world's population
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:52.000]  from the order of seven billions of people to less than two what we're
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:57.000]  seeing now is the implementation or attempted implementation of that
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:02.000]  policy to reduce the world population including that proportionately of the
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:07.000]  United States to that level and to create such a state of chaos in the
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:13.000]  world that the empire can continue to rule over us that's really what is in
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:17.000]  the mind and when you look at the World Wildlife Fund and similar kinds of
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:22.000]  institutions which are the British monarchy then you see explicitly that
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:28.000]  is the bottom line intention and by the way everything you say is so backed up
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:34.000]  with history it was Prince Philip and his cousin Prince Bernhard who set it
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:38.000]  up it's openly eugenics arm they conservatively want to get rid of 60
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:43.000]  others say 80% and in all these UN biological diversity assessments and
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:49.000]  in the Henry Kissinger State Department memorandum 200 their criminal Nazi
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:53.000]  like and we know the Nazis were just a spinoff of their eugenics ideas started
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:57.000]  again in England with the Galtons again it's all history they are openly
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:04.000]  declaring war on civilization war on humanity war on true information this
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:10.000]  this is a scorched earth policy and it's stated by them publicly they are
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:15.000]  openly admitting their treason against humanity what it was specifically
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:18.000]  though from your research what's happening in North Africa in the Middle
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:22.000]  East what you're seeing there is a phenomenon which is actually quite a
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:26.000]  lawful phenomenon it's called a mass strike in which you have a spontaneous
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:30.000]  eruption among people we've seen this particularly in the generation between
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:36.000]  say 25 and 45 where the usual concentration is now it was that case in
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:41.000]  Egypt was that in Tunisia it was that which is going on in Libya is being
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:45.000]  made a mess up now but it's what's going on in Madison Wisconsin it's what's
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:49.000]  going on in other parts of the United States you're getting a reflection of
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:56.000]  this which we saw in one form in August of 2009 now we're seeing the same
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:02.000]  thing extended as a more or less globally spreading mass strike movement
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:06.000]  this is spontaneous movement not an organized one they're what they're
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:12.000]  organized elements but it's spontaneous as we see for example the in the
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:17.000]  United States look at teachers now the characteristic of teachers is they
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:22.000]  believe in children they believe in building the future for children so you
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:28.000]  find the leadership of opposition to the Republican Party of clowns as well as
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:32.000]  the Democratic clowns you see the opposition that was being led by
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:38.000]  teachers together with some of their students from the high school age and
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:45.000]  this is a spontaneous revolt against evil by people who do not fully
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:50.000]  understand what the problem is but they know that they have to stand up and
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:56.000]  fight against it mr. LaRouge looking at this though the dominoes were set up
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:00.000]  because of dollar devaluation food prices increasing in these terrible
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:04.000]  countries where on average roughly half the population makes about two
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:08.000]  dollars a day or less clearly the ingredients were there through IMF and
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:12.000]  World Bank policy so they knew what they were doing but then they send in
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:16.000]  Western agitators to try to tip the dominoes themselves so they can control
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:22.000]  the outcome with Mubarak with Gaddafi with all of these people I mean clearly
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:26.000]  the people have a reason to be angry and to be standing up but I see the
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:31.000]  establishment trying to basically herd these movements towards an outcome that
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:35.000]  they want which is further destabilization of the Middle East do you not see
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:39.000]  that there from your research not the same way I the point is you had the
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:45.000]  case of the French Revolution 1782 the French King made a mistake
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:51.000]  and his mistake was oppressive for the people of France when the French
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:57.000]  monarchy refused to admit that it was being manipulated by the British with a
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:03.000]  wrong policy the the French people became angrier and angrier and angrier
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:10.000]  and they then exploded when Lafayette lost his nerve in declaring the action
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:16.000]  which he should have done you had the unleashing of madness the danger now is
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:22.000]  that if we do not get great order in society by restoring justice which is
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:27.000]  what the situation is always in these situations if we do not act to restore
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:33.000]  justice you'll get chaos that's what we're headed to but the social engineers
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:37.000]  going back to the Rand Corporation 15 years ago openly said that we were
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:40.000]  going to be an undemocratic society that they were going to vertically
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:43.000]  integrate and they were going to put federalized police standardized
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:49.000]  training worldwide threat fusion spying centers in place that terror attacks
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:54.000]  would be used as the pretext to smoke screen this police state suppressive
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:58.000]  rollout so they know their policies are going to generate this then they
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:03.000]  plan to use the rebellion as a pretext to then openly bring out their
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:09.000]  martial law grid your take on that we can beat them but we have to be smart
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:15.000]  we could beat them it's just the idea of fighting a war of fighting any kind
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:21.000]  of battle can be a mistake you've got to have a good strategy and I think now
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:27.000]  we're what I read as the situation we're on the verge of a crisis beyond
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:33.000]  belief you have two crises together on the one hand you have this financial
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:41.000]  monetary economic crisis on the other hand you have a wave of crises in
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:47.000]  terms of what happened in Japan what happened in South New Zealand in Christ
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:51.000]  Church what is going to happen on the coast of all the Pacific of the United
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:56.000]  States what is happening around the world you're going to see a pattern of
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:02.000]  earthquakes over the coming two years or so which beats anything in human
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:08.000]  experience today why I say that is we're in a cycle and the cycle is determined
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:15.000]  by our galaxy not the solar system as such we're in a 62 billion year cycle
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:20.000]  which is well known to people starting these matters this is a period in
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:29.000]  which the greatest rate of perturbation is likely so we're on the verge of a
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:35.000]  crisis of humanity beyond belief unless we take the proper action and this
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:42.000]  president is shutting down the means of detection by which we can be organized
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:47.000]  to defend ourselves against what's coming down with these earthquakes and it is
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:54.000]  beyond belief level nine earthquakes they are predictable but then you have
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:58.000]  the president of the United States says they are not predictable that lying
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:02.000]  president of the United States should be out of there Mr. LaRouge I want to
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:05.000]  expand on that because I did notice months ago you were writing about a
[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:10.000]  increase in earthquakes and tectonic events even before what we saw unfold
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:16.000]  on the eastern coast of Japan and I did notice two weeks before the March 11th
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:22.000]  event even ABC News said well the giant moon the moon closer than it had been
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:27.000]  in 20 years doesn't just manipulate the tides of the oceans of the planet but
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:34.000]  also the magma that these floating continents are on top of and I am
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:38.000]  seeing a lot of mainline astrophysicists like Pierce Corbin very highly
[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:42.000]  respected out of England he said no doubt that the solar cycle that when that
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:49.000]  earthquake happened that the 9.1 they now upgraded it that a solar flares ionizing
[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:54.000]  radiation hit the earth two hours before coinciding with the quote giant moon
[01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:58.000]  the moon being closer than it had been in 20 years and that that's what triggered
[01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:02.000]  it and I have read some of the astrophysicists with this larger galactic
[01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:06.000]  plane that we're passing through that's a little too technical in my research
[01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:10.000]  but undoubtedly the moon manipulates and some manipulates climate and tectonic
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:17.000]  magnetic fields and I know that Obama's canceled some satellites that can
[01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:21.000]  you know measure all over the world the rising and falling of tectonic events
[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:26.000]  so so go through the technicals on that then I want to shift gears into if we
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:30.000]  don't avert things and some of your ideas for solutions what the what the
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:36.000]  globalist are going to bring us through and what we're going to see in your forecast
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:41.000]  well I just take the top of the back end of it first what we're looking at is the
[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:46.000]  threat if we do not get rid of this president I mean that's correct that's
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:52.000]  crucial under this president as long as he has the authority of president he is
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:57.000]  going to prevent everything from happening that should happen we must
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:02.000]  remove him from office the 25th amendment section for provides for his
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:07.000]  removal for office on the basis of his mental condition and the mental
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:12.000]  condition is specifically that which is his now if we get rid of him as president
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:19.000]  in that way then we meet and get the glass teagle through we can begin to
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:23.000]  unleash the measures of protection which could avert this now nobody can
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:27.000]  guarantee we're going to come out of this alive not what's coming out but we
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:33.000]  don't have a chance of living this planet does not have a chance of living
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:38.000]  unless we get this president out of office very soon but serve them in the
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:42.000]  republicans have a call to bring back glass teagle there the republicans and
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:46.000]  democrats are all financed by the same financial oligarchy what do we get
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:52.000]  biden hillary i mean these people are just just just i know bomb is a
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:56.000]  teleprompter reading a minion well you've got to look at one other thing
[01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:01.000]  about our system in the background of how our system works our system of
[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:07.000]  government has many different aspects now while i've been his president of
[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:11.000]  the united states and still has respect and while the majority of the
[01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:17.000]  congress is in authority we behave well and put up with a lot of things a
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:22.000]  lot of terrible things and abuses we sometimes go for several generations
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:26.000]  of suffering from those conditions because we know the importance of
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:32.000]  stability of government therefore we will not recklessly disturb the system
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:38.000]  of government but when the point comes as of now that the very existence of
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:42.000]  the united states in particular is just is jeopardized and a threat to the
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:48.000]  world as well in terms of this wave of earthquakes and this is oncoming there
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:55.000]  are people in the united states who in a proper way will join to act to
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:48:01.000]  eliminate this problem and my function is and i've been in this thing for a
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:07.000]  long time on the sdi for example is one of our efforts in that direction we're
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:12.000]  going to have to mobilize not just to fight we're going to mobilize in a way
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:17.000]  which understands our system of government and how to use it without
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:21.000]  violating oh yeah let's quantify let's quantify that
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:24.000]  specifically from the research and clearly the earth going into a more
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:29.000]  tectonic you know active period we know their cycles we know there was a big
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:33.000]  earthquake in mexico today and other earthquakes another one off japan
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:37.000]  specifically what i mean what are you predicting is going to happen
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:43.000]  we're going to have right now an increase during the coming two years
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:48.000]  of an increase now we're operating on the basis of up to a nine level
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:51.000]  where i'm afraid we're headed toward a twelve
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:56.000]  i can't guarantee it i can't assure it but though we also remember this president
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:02.000]  is shutting down all the detectors we have which enable us to for forecast
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:06.000]  the president says we cannot forecast the president is a liar
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:12.000]  the people who are backing the president putting al gore is a liar on this question
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:17.000]  you've got to get those liars out of office because if we do that
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:22.000]  we look what we're faced with practical now we're looking at the
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:27.000]  san francisco area we're looking at the state of washington we're looking at
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:32.000]  some other points in the united states which are right to go
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:38.000]  with up to a level nine earthquake we are much inferior in our ability
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:42.000]  to defend against that level of earthquake than japan was
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:47.000]  japan was well organized to defend itself we are not
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:51.000]  and because of the recent presidencies we are not
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:55.000]  therefore we we've got to get this guy out of there
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:50:00.000]  because as long as he remains in there you will not be able to solve any of these
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:04.000]  problems and so therefore we have to get him out
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:09.000]  and if we don't get him out I don't know who's going to save the planet
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:13.000]  because this this thing is now hitting in the southeast asia
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:19.000]  all the entire world area we call the rim of fire in the middle of the oceans
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:25.000]  on the coast of a planet of continents you have a rim of fire
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:31.000]  when one of these things like a solar movement of this type with a galactic factor in it
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:36.000]  comes into play you have an essentially uncontrollable expansion
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:40.000]  of earthquakes beyond anyone's belief today
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:43.000]  well more and more scientists you know they thought we only got hit by big asteroids
[01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:46.000]  every million years now they admit it's probably over a hundred thousand
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:49.000]  we look at ancient civilizations destroyed by this stuff
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:52.000]  meanwhile the federal government's turning off the radiation detectors
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:56.000]  and raising the level they say is safe so that shows there's this policy
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000]  of just telling us to muddle through it
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:01.000]  two more segments with Lyndon LaRouche straight ahead
[01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:05.000]  hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:08.000]  in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:13.000]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:16.000]  it's true seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000]  and it's possible that could even happen again
[01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:23.000]  so our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:29.000]  they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food
[01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000]  for you and your family and here's the best part
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:34.000]  these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way
[01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:38.000]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden
[01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:41.000]  so visit them today at survivalseedbank.com
[01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000]  that's survivalseedbank.com
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:48.000]  or give them a call at 877-327-0365
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:52.000]  that's 877-327-0365
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:57.000]  remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:00.000]  this is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com
[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:07.000]  Dr. David Berry has provided excellent advice for all those interested in practical economics and sound money
[01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000]  it's certainly worth reading
[01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:12.000]  that's what Congressman Ron Paul said about chaching wisdom
[01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:15.000]  123 practical universal truths about money
[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000]  the new book by Dr. David Berry
[01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000]  the cool part of this book certainly it'll speak to you personally
[01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:22.000]  your life, your lifestyle, your money, your investments
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:25.000]  but it also can be generalized into the nation
[01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:26.000]  what's going on as a nation
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000]  we do these same things personally that we do as a nation
[01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:34.000]  Dr. Berry's book, chaching wisdom, presents many facets of your relationship with the once almighty dollar
[01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:38.000]  and how current national and international politics affect your daily life
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000]  some of the other things are about that
[01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:43.000]  they're not just economic, they're philosophical
[01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:46.000]  there's psychology involved in this book, there's philosophy involved in this book
[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:52.000]  read chaching wisdom by Dr. David Berry, only $9.95 available at chachingwisdom.com

[01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:18.000]  chachingwisdom.com
[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:30.000]  just one of 11 great songs from the Ralpham Under the Sun
[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000]  Spring and a new growing season are here
[01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:36.000]  plan a healthy garden easy and fast with organica seed.com
[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:44.000]  easy because organica seed.com offers one of the largest online selections of organic, heirloom, non-hybrid and untreated seeds
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:47.000]  as well as tobacco and cotton seeds at low prices
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000]  go to organica seed.com
[01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:54.000]  spelled O-R-G-A-N-I-C-A seed.com
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000]  organica seed.com
[01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:01.000]  remember, organica seed is healthy seed
[01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:06.000]  no one knows what it's like to be the bad one
[01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:10.000]  we've only got this five minute segment, then a one minute break, then five more minutes with Lyndon LaRouche
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:13.000]  I look forward to having him back up in the future, we appreciate him joining us
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:17.000]  LaRouchePAC.com, I agree with their historical breakdown
[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:21.000]  it's very accurate from my research separately and looking at their research
[01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:25.000]  I don't 100% agree with some of the political ideas and outcomes
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:28.000]  we'll have Mr. LaRouche back in the near future if he'll do it
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000]  to get more into that debate and discussion
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:35.000]  but I see Bloomberg admitting $376 billion in Wacovia
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:39.000]  and Wells Fargo have laundered drug money running the drug aircraft Wacovia
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:44.000]  I see AP and others reporting that all the veterans a secret deal was signed
[01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:48.000]  11 years ago after Glass-Steagall to steal all their death benefits
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000]  that they pay in to out of their paychecks
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:53.000]  the way they commit these crimes out in the open
[01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:56.000]  it says if they don't think there'll be a civilization here
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:01.000]  or as if they are going to release some type of humanized mouse pox to wipe us all out
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000]  you know, they talk about this
[01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:06.000]  these people, it's just unlimited what they could do
[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:09.000]  but Mr. LaRouche, in the few minutes we've got left here
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:13.000]  specifically getting into their end game again
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:16.000]  what they're trying to do, what they're trying to do to the dollar
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:19.000]  how George Soros plays in with the Rothschild
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:22.000]  Queen of England, Rockefeller Constellation
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:26.000]  this move towards Bretton Woods too, this attack on the dollar
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:30.000]  can you tell us what they're trying to do and what the time frame is right now
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:33.000]  and as this collapse accelerates they're telling us the economy is great
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:36.000]  everybody more and more knows they're being lied to
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:40.000]  well there are two things to this, first of all what they're doing is obvious to me
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:43.000]  it's no mystery
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:48.000]  but the one thing is don't overestimate their competence
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:51.000]  that's where the weakness lies
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:54.000]  they are not competent
[01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:58.000]  because their program depends upon denying
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:03.000]  fundamental principles of nature and the human being both
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:06.000]  and their system does not work
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:10.000]  and when they're trying to crush the system
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:13.000]  for their chosen ends
[01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:17.000]  they're meddling with something way beyond their command
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:21.000]  so we should not exaggerate their power
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:25.000]  we should rather understand our own weakness
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:28.000]  and correct our own weaknesses
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:33.000]  because they are not intelligent people, this president is not an intelligent person
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:37.000]  the Queen of England I don't think is a particularly intelligent person
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:40.000]  so these people are not all knowing
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000]  they have schemes
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:45.000]  and we're discussing the kind of schemes they have
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000]  but they're not that smart
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000]  they are also stupid
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:53.000]  and one of the dangers they represent is they're so stupid
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:56.000]  they don't understand what they're going to do to themselves
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:00.000]  in what they're trying to do to others and us
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000]  well I tend to agree with you
[01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:06.000]  I mean they're intelligent and cunning like a fox or a snake
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000]  like a rattlesnake
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:11.000]  and they've got the will and they're bold
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:14.000]  and they are dominating but they're not in full control
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:18.000]  they're able to wreck, have it, can consolidate it, they're able to destroy
[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000]  but not to build
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:23.000]  and Paul has said the key now is to expose them
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:27.000]  as the authors of the pain and destruction we're seeing
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:30.000]  so that we can then as humanity have a debate about
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000]  what to replace it with
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:36.000]  but where do you see George Soros in this group?
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:40.000]  George Soros was as a young man, as an adolescent
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000]  was working for the Nazis
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:45.000]  he was a Jew working for the Nazis in Hungary
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:48.000]  he became an agent
[01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:51.000]  and giving people their tickets to Auschwitz
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:54.000]  when the tickets were assigned
[01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:57.000]  he then went on, he's always admitted that
[01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000]  he's never denied it
[01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:02.000]  but he said it was one of the best experiences of his life, it made him
[01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:06.000]  he then went on and the British intelligence services
[01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000]  picked him up
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000]  he's a British agent
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:13.000]  and he was a key part of the financing
[01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:16.000]  which brought the current President Barack Obama
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000]  into the presidency
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:21.000]  he is now running an operation based on the same program
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000]  and the same intention
[01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:26.000]  he's now trying to find a bunch of susceptible idiots
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:30.000]  who would believe that he really intends to do some good for somebody
[01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000]  stay there, absolutely, that's his cover
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000]  how he's this humanitarian philanthropist
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000]  who said if I didn't help round up Jews
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000]  somebody else would have, so it was okay
[01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:47.000]  that's a quote from 60 Minutes
[01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000]  the crazy part is
[01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:12.000]  he's usually right
[01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000]  you see, he predicted the collapse of GM
[01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:17.000]  Danny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner
[01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:18.000]  General Growth Properties
[01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:21.000]  in fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy
[01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000]  recently, he created a video
[01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000]  which you can watch online for free
[01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000]  detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet
[01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000]  and it's a real eye-opener
[01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:30.000]  I can't stress this enough
[01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:33.000]  you should at least watch this free video online today
[01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000]  he explains everything you need to know
[01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000]  including simple steps you can take to protect yourself
[01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:42.000]  you can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com
[01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000]  that's End of America, the number 3.com

[02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000]  live from Austin, Texas
[02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:23.000]  Alex Jones
[02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:26.000]  well, he's agreed to come back in the next month or so
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000]  one hour is not enough at Lennon & LaRouche
[02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:29.000]  LaRouchePack.com
[02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000]  they have a lot of books and materials
[02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:32.000]  and things that are available there
[02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000]  their executive intelligence review
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:35.000]  a lot of key information
[02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:36.000]  check it out at LaRouchePack.com
[02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000]  and Alex Jones with InfoWars.com
[02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:39.000]  but getting into George Soros
[02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000]  he's definitely a front line
[02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000]  general for the Anglo-American
[02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:46.000]  Dutch New World Order system
[02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000]  should I be concerned that memos were leaked
[02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000]  two weeks ago to Politico
[02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000]  that he's coming after not just Fox News
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000]  and Glenn Beck with some in-fighting there
[02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000]  but myself included
[02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000]  they're attacking me almost on a daily basis
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000]  through his house organs like media matters
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000]  and they've sworn in the internal memos
[02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000]  to destroy and sabotage
[02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:07.000]  any media that opposes this death of the dollar
[02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:10.000]  and they've had their reporters
[02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:13.000]  writing hit pieces in major publications
[02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000]  why do you think they're coming after InfoWars
[02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000]  Mr. LaRouche
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:20.000]  this is certainly a cover operation
[02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000]  that's all it is
[02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:25.000]  the point is the thing on George Soros is
[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:28.000]  the people are afraid to attack him
[02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000]  for what he is
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:33.000]  this guy is a guy
[02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000]  who will knowingly
[02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:39.000]  assisted in the execution of Jews
[02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000]  particularly Jews from Hungary
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000]  who were being shipped to the camps
[02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:46.000]  now his role was a minor one
[02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000]  but he was working under Incognito
[02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000]  I don't blame him for that
[02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:53.000]  but he said he liked that
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:56.000]  that there was the most heroic period of his life
[02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000]  and the man of this character
[02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:01.000]  being promoted by British intelligence
[02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000]  on us
[02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000]  you know
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:08.000]  the problem is people are not attacking him
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:11.000]  publicly enough for what he really is
[02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000]  well who are these quote liberal mercenaries
[02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000]  that enthrongs worship him
[02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:18.000]  and decry anyone who doesn't fall down and worship him
[02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000]  as Nazis
[02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:23.000]  the British protect him, the British use him
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000]  the British own him
[02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000]  he's a British agent
[02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:30.000]  why do you think they're so scared of alternative media
[02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:34.000]  they are because they know that they are vulnerable
[02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:37.000]  they're afraid that we get smart
[02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:40.000]  and that we normally oppose them
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:44.000]  but that we develop the effective means for destroying them
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000]  well it is us or them
[02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:49.000]  I mean they're coming down with a neo feudalistic
[02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:52.000]  Malthusian system
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:55.000]  and you said something in closing
[02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:58.000]  at the last segment about how they're delusional
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:01.000]  and I remember Carl Rowe to the New York Times saying
[02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000]  you guys can be reality based
[02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:06.000]  we're in control so we're going to make up
[02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000]  whatever reality we want
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:11.000]  they're going to sell us on their own delusion
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000]  but if we don't go along with the emperor's new clothes
[02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000]  it's game over
[02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:18.000]  the question is you have to have leadership with guts
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000]  I mean you have to have
[02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000]  the problem with our baby boomer generation
[02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000]  was subjected to 60 years
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:27.000]  was subjected to a kind of brainwashing operation
[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000]  which many of them are still good people
[02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:32.000]  but the stuffing would taken out of them
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:35.000]  and they don't fight as my generation would have fought
[02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:38.000]  those of us unfortunately most of my generation are dead
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000]  we were in World War II
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:43.000]  and we had a different temperament and a different idea
[02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000]  about how to fight
[02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000]  you know I always respected
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000]  what was done by MacArthur for example
[02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:52.000]  what was done by Kennedy with MacArthur
[02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:55.000]  in opposing getting into this wasting war
[02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000]  in southwest Asia
[02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000]  which resulted, in Southeast Asia
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:02.000]  which resulted in our destroying ourselves
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:05.000]  and that gave birth to the 68th phenomenon
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:08.000]  we have to get smart
[02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000]  we have to think strategically
[02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000]  not just emotionally
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000]  well you're absolutely right about that
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000]  this has been a very thought provoking interview
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000]  and as things begin to unfold
[02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000]  we'll continue to get your perspective
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000]  and we really appreciate you and your crew
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000]  having you join us today
[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000]  Lyndon LaRouche, LaRouchePak.com
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000]  Alex Jones with infowars.com
[02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000]  and we'll be in touch and have you back
[02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000]  in the near future and also
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000]  some of your other researchers
[02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000]  to break down the technicals of what's happening
[02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000]  thank you Mr. LaRouche
[02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000]  alright ladies and gentlemen
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000]  we'll be right back with our next guest
[02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000]  and a ton of other news and information
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000]  we'll look more at the economy
[02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000]  Libya and a lot more straight ahead
[02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000]  right here on the GCN Radio Network
[02:04:50.000 --> 02:05:02.000]  LaRouchePak.com
[02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000]  Hi folks this is Alex Jones
[02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000]  and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator
[02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000]  now you can produce pure
[02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000]  and endless colloidal silver
[02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000]  and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream
[02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000]  by breathing the solution
[02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000]  through the lungs
[02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000]  the respiratory system is the first line
[02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000]  to form pathogens and viruses
[02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000]  the Silver Lungs Generator
[02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000]  infuses the respiratory system
[02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000]  with your self produced nano silver solutions
[02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000]  and also delivers
[02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000]  the silver nano particles
[02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000]  instantly into the bloodstream
[02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000]  with continued legislation threatening the sale
[02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000]  of nano silver products
[02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000]  you can now produce pure
[02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000]  and endless colloidal silver
[02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000]  with the Silver Lungs Generator
[02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000]  very easy to follow step by step instructions
[02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000]  are provided making production fast and simple
[02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:50.000]  go to www.silverlungs.com today
[02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000]  and learn more about the breakthrough technology
[02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000]  of the Silver Lungs Generator
[02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000]  that's www.silverlungs.com
[02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny
[02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000]  in the last century alone
[02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:09.000]  this is our last chance to not relive history
[02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000]  as we're finishing off this agenda
[02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:14.000]  we'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000]  and have tremendous influence
[02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000]  on our President and Congress
[02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000]  and they really are calling the shots
[02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:23.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000]  as American citizens to pay attention
[02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000]  full of the republic identifies
[02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000]  the enemies of our nation
[02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000]  the criminal offshore cartel
[02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000]  held bent on destroying sovereignty
[02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000]  and on its ashes constructing world government
[02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:38.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists
[02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000]  they're asking for more matches
[02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000]  and the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to
[02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000]  today seems like nobody does care
[02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000]  and right now in Washington DC
[02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:49.000]  we have seen a fall of the republic
[02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000]  get your copy of fall of the republic
[02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:54.000]  on DVD at infowars.com
[02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000]  we're watching online right now
[02:06:56.000 --> 02:07:00.000]  in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv
[02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons
[02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:05.000]  you should consider buying a solar power generator
[02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000]  number one, new climate legislation
[02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000]  could easily double or triple your electric bill
[02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:12.000]  number two, our new energy czar wants to control
[02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:15.000]  how much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:18.000]  it's true, total government control of electricity
[02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:23.000]  number three, in some areas of the country
[02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000]  and now new socialist legislation
[02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000]  is only compounding the problem
[02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:32.000]  number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000]  every year thousands of families
[02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000]  lose their power from weather related onages
[02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:40.000]  number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance
[02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:41.000]  and peace of mind
[02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000]  folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000]  offered by solutions from science
[02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:46.000]  one of my oldest sponsors
[02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:50.000]  you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000]  that's mysolarbackup.com
[02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000]  remember, the government doesn't own the sun
[02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000]  so go to mysolarbackup.com
[02:07:56.000 --> 02:08:00.000]  or call 1-877-327-0365
[02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000]  Big Brother
[02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000]  mainstream media
[02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000]  government cover-ups
[02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000]  you want answers?
[02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:09.000]  well, so does he
[02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000]  he's Alex Jones
[02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000]  on the GCN radio network
[02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:16.000]  and now, live from Austin, Texas
[02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000]  Alex Jones
[02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000]  we are now in two hour number three
[02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:24.000]  eight minutes in
[02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:27.000]  David Ike is our guest for the rest of the day
[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:30.000]  maybe a little bit in the next hour if you can do it
[02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000]  David Ike, a former professional soccer player
[02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000]  journalist, network anchor for the BBC
[02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:37.000]  spokesman in the 80s for the British Green Party
[02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:38.000]  he was the head of it
[02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000]  and since 1990, full-time investigator
[02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000]  into what is really controlling the world
[02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:45.000]  many have dubbed Ike the most controversial speaker on the planet
[02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000]  his newest book, Human Race Get Off Your Knees
[02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:50.000]  The Lion Sleeps No More is available at www.DavidIke.com
[02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000]  I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com
[02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:55.000]  so, George Soros is openly convening
[02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:58.000]  Bretton Woods 2 to move away from the dollar
[02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000]  open world government is all over
[02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:03.000]  every major publication as the solution
[02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:06.000]  a new idea they just got five minutes ago
[02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000]  and it's exactly what we broke down from their documents
[02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000]  decades ago they were planning
[02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000]  they're now in the Associated Press saying
[02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:13.000]  yeah, we're chemtrailing you
[02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000]  it's to save the earth from global warming
[02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000]  they're just throwing so much in our face
[02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000]  they're starting all these new wars
[02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000]  in the Middle East
[02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:22.000]  financing the rebels
[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000]  openly moving to try to overthrow
[02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:27.000]  their former dictators and oligarchs
[02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000]  and royalty
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000]  the monarchs
[02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000]  CNBC is reporting that the U.S. is going to go
[02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000]  the same route as Greece, Portugal
[02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000]  we're being imploded by design
[02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000]  just as the big banks have done to the third world
[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000]  they're doing a government shutdown right now
[02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:44.000]  to scapegoat the unions and the welfare moms
[02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000]  and I'm not saying they're perfect
[02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000]  the point is that's rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic
[02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000]  compared to the 1.5 quadrillion
[02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:53.000]  in fake fiat debt made up by the bankers
[02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000]  that they've gotten us to sign on to
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:58.000]  we're now entering the next phase of the New World Order
[02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:01.000]  and after that comes biological weapons releases
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:04.000]  to wipe out most of the population the globalists have stated
[02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000]  I mean we're following their own blueprints here
[02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:07.000]  we're not making this stuff up
[02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000]  truth is stranger than fiction
[02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000]  and my film Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslaved
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000]  covers that population reduction program
[02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000]  and how the globalists are delusional and on power trips
[02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:16.000]  and think they're God
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000]  and they're going to merge with machines
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:19.000]  after they get rid of us
[02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:20.000]  whether that's going to happen or not
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:23.000]  or whether that's theoretical
[02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:24.000]  it can actually be done
[02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:25.000]  that can be debated
[02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000]  the point is these people are nuts
[02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:28.000]  as Karl Rove said
[02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:29.000]  they control reality
[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000]  doesn't matter what reality is
[02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:32.000]  a fool goes before the fall
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:35.000]  they are filled with delusions of grandeur
[02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:38.000]  on serious power trips as most psychopaths are
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000]  and psychopaths get more and more arrogant
[02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:41.000]  more and more out of control
[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:42.000]  they enjoy hardship
[02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000]  they enjoy mutating societies
[02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000]  culturally, spiritually, intellectually
[02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000]  so they can manipulate us better
[02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000]  and I say no to this
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:51.000]  I'm not their slave
[02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:52.000]  I don't want to be their slave
[02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000]  as David Ike says human race
[02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:55.000]  get off your knees
[02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000]  so here to discuss a host of issues
[02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000]  from what's happening in Japan, Libya
[02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000]  the new earthquakes
[02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000]  all of it is David Ike
[02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000]  David Ike, good to have you back with us
[02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:06.000]  cheers Alex
[02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:07.000]  so much is going on
[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000]  now you heard me throw out a plethora of things
[02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:10.000]  we can get into first
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000]  or if you want to go somewhere else first
[02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:13.000]  you've got the floor
[02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000]  well I think that what we're seeing now
[02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000]  is absolutely the next stage
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000]  of what we've been talking about
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000]  for a long, long time
[02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:24.000]  what's been predicted
[02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000]  what people have said is just
[02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000]  conspiracy supposition
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:29.000]  and all that stuff
[02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000]  is now increasingly in our faces
[02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000]  I mean what we're seeing
[02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000]  for instance with what's going on
[02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000]  in the Middle East is
[02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:40.000]  they're talking about the international community
[02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000]  this is being said
[02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000]  all over a range of things
[02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:45.000]  all over the world
[02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000]  in different situations
[02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000]  the international community
[02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:52.000]  that's just code for world government of course
[02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000]  and one of the crucial things in
[02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000]  the Middle East
[02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000]  is that they've handed over
[02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000]  at least officially
[02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000]  the operation in Libya
[02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:03.000]  to NATO
[02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:06.000]  and I wrote in a book in 1994
[02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000]  that the world army
[02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000]  was going to be in part
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:14.000]  kind of stepping stone into existence
[02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:15.000]  by NATO
[02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:16.000]  and NATO countries
[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000]  operating more and more and more
[02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000]  out of the North Atlantic region
[02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000]  they're in Afghanistan
[02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000]  we've actually got a world army
[02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:25.000]  in Afghanistan
[02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000]  they're now taking over this stuff
[02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:28.000]  in Libya
[02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:29.000]  this nonsense
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000]  this completely engineered situation
[02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:32.000]  and as you said
[02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:33.000]  we've got Soros now
[02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000]  wanting to put his
[02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000]  economic
[02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000]  I'm sure the World Central Bank
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:40.000]  will be in there somewhere
[02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000]  so all these things that we've been talking about
[02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000]  and people have either
[02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:47.000]  looked at it or said that's nonsense
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:48.000]  I'm sorry
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:49.000]  it's in your face
[02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000]  it's on the TV news now
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000]  and this is just the start of this phase
[02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000]  if we don't wake up
[02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:56.000]  as a human race
[02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000]  in vast numbers
[02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:01.000]  and stop cooperating with this system
[02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000]  then all we're going to do
[02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:06.000]  is watch our own prison being built
[02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000]  because you can be in ignorance
[02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:09.000]  that the prison is being built
[02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:10.000]  and it's being built
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000]  or you can become a bit more informed
[02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:13.000]  about what's going on
[02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000]  and then you can consciously watch
[02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:16.000]  your prison being built
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:19.000]  there is an alternative to that
[02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000]  which is we put down the
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000]  divide and rule lines of religion
[02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000]  and race and the income bracket
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:26.000]  and country and culture
[02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000]  and come together
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:31.000]  realizing that we're all the targets
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000]  no matter what our religion, color or culture
[02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:34.000]  we're all the targets
[02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:37.000]  and we're reaching of course
[02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:41.000]  another level of this situation
[02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:44.000]  which I've been looking at for a while Alex
[02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:45.000]  and ticking them off
[02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000]  and that's radiation
[02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000]  we've seen this of course
[02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:52.000]  a terrible radiation outbreak
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:55.000]  and release as a result of the Japan earthquake
[02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000]  but I've been ticking them off for years
[02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:01.000]  there is definitely a clear agenda
[02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:04.000]  to make humans receive
[02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000]  more and more sources of radiation
[02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000]  the cell phones, the body scanners
[02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:12.000]  I had Dr. Busby, top chemical physicist on
[02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000]  and he said many of my colleagues believe
[02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:15.000]  this is being done on purpose
[02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:18.000]  because sperm counts down by over 85%
[02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000]  now they're saying in the US
[02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000]  they're going to raise the safe level of radiation
[02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000]  to 25,000 times what it was
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:25.000]  they're saying don't worry
[02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000]  that it's in the milk and the food
[02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:28.000]  it's good for you
[02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:31.000]  Fukushima is still blowing up and smoking
[02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000]  and they're telling us it's no problem
[02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:36.000]  and now Ann Coulter comes out
[02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:37.000]  and says radiation is good
[02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000]  Mom Biot who wants world government
[02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:42.000]  he's saying he's now for nuclear power
[02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000]  many people believe they're putting him
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000]  in population centers to reduce fertility
[02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000]  and other things you see
[02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:51.000]  because at the end of everything
[02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:54.000]  beyond the physical body that we see
[02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:57.000]  we are an electromagnetic field
[02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000]  people call it the auric field
[02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:00.000]  it can be measured
[02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:01.000]  it's electromagnetic
[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:04.000]  just as the earth has a magnetosphere
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:05.000]  so do humans
[02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:08.000]  and when you introduce
[02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:11.000]  sources of radiation
[02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:15.000]  that are going to disharmonize
[02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000]  and disrupt and disturb
[02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000]  distort that energy field
[02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000]  then you're throwing forward
[02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000]  into health
[02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:24.000]  into the way we think
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:25.000]  and all these things
[02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000]  the way our brains work
[02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:30.000]  a whole lot of potential consequences
[02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000]  because you're distorting
[02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000]  the harmony of the human energy field
[02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:37.000]  and it's definitely
[02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000]  a cold calculated policy
[02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000]  like I said I've been ticking them off
[02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:44.000]  the increasing sources of radiation
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:45.000]  and there's another one
[02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:46.000]  that a lot of people miss
[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000]  and that's HAAP
[02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000]  because what HAAP is doing
[02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000]  in Alaska is it's bouncing
[02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:55.000]  fantastic amount of power
[02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:58.000]  of radio waves into the ionosphere
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000]  the upper atmosphere of the planet
[02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:03.000]  which has among other things
[02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:06.000]  the role of protecting the earth
[02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:09.000]  from incoming cosmic radiation
[02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000]  that wouldn't be terribly good for us
[02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:14.000]  and you look at the document
[02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:17.000]  that came out around 1999
[02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000]  out of the European Parliament
[02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000]  the report on HAAP
[02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.000]  that people can see on the internet
[02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000]  where it's actually talking about fact
[02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:29.000]  and then that HAAP was shooting holes
[02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000]  in the ionosphere
[02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000]  and opening up the earth
[02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:36.000]  therefore us to cosmic radiation
[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000]  that should be deflected away
[02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000]  now all this stuff
[02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000]  is not happening by accident
[02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000]  it's a coordinated attempt
[02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:48.000]  to change the sea
[02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:49.000]  that we live in
[02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:52.000]  if you want to affect all this fish
[02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:53.000]  at the same time what you do
[02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000]  you affect the sea
[02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000]  and we live in a sea of
[02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000]  energy fields
[02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000]  and if you manipulate that
[02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.000]  you therefore affect all the people
[02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000]  who are operating in that field
[02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:06.000]  and that's what's going on
[02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000]  well look at how they approve
[02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000]  the cell phones which thousands of studies now admit
[02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000]  manipulates the mind
[02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000]  I think we can just search the term right now
[02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:18.000]  cell phones affect brain waves
[02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000]  cancers
[02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000]  the cell towers
[02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000]  RF and all their studies
[02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000]  from even before they legalized it
[02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:27.000]  showed it would do this
[02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:28.000]  but they still roll it out
[02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:31.000]  even though it hurts the elite's own children
[02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000]  why do the globalists love to hurt themselves
[02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000]  not just us
[02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:38.000]  well maybe they're not quite the same as us
[02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000]  maybe that's the answer
[02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000]  therefore they're not affected in the same way
[02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000]  I mean you know Alex
[02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000]  the rabbit hole of all this
[02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000]  goes so deep
[02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000]  deeper than any of us have got so far
[02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000]  but we will
[02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000]  and we're going to have to open our minds
[02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000]  in the end to the fact that
[02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:59.000]  the situation we're facing
[02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000]  is much greater
[02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000]  and operates over multiple
[02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000]  different levels beyond the ones that we see
[02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000]  touch and taste
[02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000]  and they clearly
[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000]  are not going to irradiate
[02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:14.000]  the planet if it's going to have a fundamental effect
[02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000]  on them too
[02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000]  so there's something different about them
[02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000]  don't we talk about
[02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000]  these bloodlines and all the rest of it
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:25.000]  the bloodlines are genetics
[02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:28.000]  the genetics are the physical level of it all
[02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:31.000]  but they are an expression of a vibrational field
[02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000]  and maybe their vibrational field
[02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000]  is not affected in this way
[02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:39.000]  the way that the rest of the human vibrational field is
[02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000]  because these are the hybrids
[02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000]  they're not the same as humans
[02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000]  this is a much bigger story
[02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000]  than people realize
[02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:50.000]  even those that have woken to great amounts of it
[02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000]  well I only go with what I can prove
[02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:55.000]  but there's no doubt that they
[02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:58.000]  love killing humans
[02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000]  the globalists love disease
[02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000]  and permanently wrecking the DNA
[02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:05.000]  with the poisons, the chemicals, the radiation
[02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000]  that's admitted our IQs are dropping
[02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000]  the sperm counts are plummeting
[02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000]  we're falling apart
[02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000]  and they're saying they're raising the safe radiation levels
[02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000]  to 25,000 times
[02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:18.000]  and they say look 25,000 times is good for you
[02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:21.000]  and baby formula over half
[02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000]  corn syrup good for you
[02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000]  the kids getting diabetes when they're five
[02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:26.000]  good for you
[02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:29.000]  turned out the federal government is knowingly covering up
[02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:32.000]  that they're mining radioactive isotopes with a fluoride
[02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:35.000]  putting it in the water supplies comes out in local Texas news
[02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000]  nobody gets in trouble
[02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:40.000]  and they're shooting kids up worldwide with syphilis
[02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000]  I mean there's no doubt
[02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:45.000]  that they want to wreck the DNA of humanity
[02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000]  and they're waging war against us
[02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000]  so they might as well be from Planet Pop-Tart
[02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000]  well the thing is Alex
[02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000]  you just reeled off all those different things
[02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:54.000]  well stay there got a break David
[02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:55.000]  we're going to give you the floor
[02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.000]  when we come back I want to get more into Libya
[02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:58.000]  more on the economy

[02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:01.000]  I'm Alex Jones
[02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:04.000]  do you want to learn more about preparing for the hard times ahead
[02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:07.000]  have you ever thought about actually getting off the grid
[02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000]  and becoming truly self-reliant
[02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.000]  introducing off the grid news
[02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000]  weekly newsletter for independent Americans
[02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:15.000]  who want practical advice on how to survive
[02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:19.000]  and even prosper in an increasingly dangerous world
[02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000]  it's the best way to get a black belt
[02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000]  in emergency preparedness, survival skills
[02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:25.000]  and off the grid living
[02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000]  packed with hard hitting information on gardening
[02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.000]  food preparation, alternative energy
[02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.000]  and home security
[02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.000]  there's simply nothing like it

[02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000]  Alex Jones here with key information
[02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000]  the US government is a Ponzi scheme
[02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000]  that relies on the Treasury
[02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:12.000]  continuously selling large amounts of government bonds
[02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000]  to foreign central banks
[02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:17.000]  with Japan about to become a seller of US bonds
[02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000]  in order to rebuild its own nation
[02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000]  and the US antagonizing China
[02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000]  by calling them currency manipulators
[02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000]  the Federal Reserve, which is already buying
[02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.000]  about 70% of US Treasuries
[02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:30.000]  will soon be the only buyer left of US Treasuries
[02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:33.000]  our friends at the National Inflation Association believe
[02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000]  that the US dollar will soon become worthless
[02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000]  and Americans will see the purchasing power
[02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000]  incomes and savings destroyed
[02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000]  I strongly urge my fellow Americans
[02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:44.000]  to sign up for the free NIA newsletter
[02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:47.000]  at www.inflation.us
[02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:50.000]  if you are sick and tired of the economic propaganda
[02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000]  and the mainstream media, sign up for free
[02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000]  at inflation.us
[02:21:54.000 --> 02:22:19.000]  to learn the economic truth that the mainstream media ignores
[02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000]  your foreign oil dependency when you go green
[02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:56.000]  with 1-2-3-cheapseller.com
[02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:01.000]  the largest part of gaining radiant health
[02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000]  is detoxification
[02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000]  you can drink ionized water, cleanse your intestines
[02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:08.000]  eat a perfect diet and even take lots of quality supplements
[02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:11.000]  and in many instances only make minimal progress
[02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000]  what is the key to detoxifying your body
[02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000]  of mercury, heavy metals, chemicals and drugs
[02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000]  it is glutathione
[02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000]  glutathione is the master antioxidant used
[02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000]  to detoxify your entire body
[02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000]  it stops free radicals, keeps sales young
[02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.000]  and reduces inflammation
[02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000]  1-world-way protein powder may be able to
[02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000]  raise your glutathione production by 64%
[02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:31.000]  or more
[02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:33.000]  1-world-way is more effective than any other
[02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000]  whey protein powder on the market
[02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000]  because it is unheated and from grass-fed cows
[02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:40.000]  all other quote cold processed whey protein powders
[02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000]  have been heated and damaged by 15%
[02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000]  or more
[02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000]  1-world-way comes in three delicious flavors
[02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:49.000]  call 888-988-3325
[02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:52.000]  that's 888-988-3325
[02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:55.000]  or visit 1-world-way.com
[02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:58.000]  that's 1-world-way.com
[02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000]  so we live on a planet
[02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:08.000]  run by a ruling elite
[02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:11.000]  who hates humanity and is doing everything they can
[02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000]  to destroy our DNA, give us cancer
[02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:16.000]  and make us basically mentally retarded
[02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000]  you've got a public that's conditioned now
[02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000]  where it comes out in Texas
[02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000]  and the government is putting radioactive isotopes
[02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000]  in the water mined at the phosphate mines
[02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000]  all over the country
[02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000]  and no one gets in trouble, nothing happens
[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:31.000]  and I'm the weirdo for reporting on it
[02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000]  now David, I rattled off a bunch of examples
[02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000]  of just psychopathic behavior
[02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000]  institutionalized with the general public
[02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000]  trained to accept it and be thankful
[02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000]  for the mass murder
[02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000]  and you were about to make a comment
[02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000]  before we hit that break
[02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000]  yeah and it's this, you know
[02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000]  all those things are reeled off
[02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:52.000]  and with more time you could have reeled off a lot more
[02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:55.000]  they're different aspects of attacks on human health
[02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:58.000]  the human mind, all these other areas
[02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000]  of human society
[02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000]  they're from a multitude
[02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000]  a mass of different directions
[02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000]  different subjects, different areas
[02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000]  and they're coming in in a coordinated way
[02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:11.000]  now does anyone still believe
[02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:14.000]  that that is being orchestrated
[02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000]  by people sitting around the table
[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000]  deciding their next move
[02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000]  it's much bigger than that
[02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000]  these players that we can name
[02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000]  are players
[02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000]  they are players out of something
[02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:29.000]  they are not actually the originators of it
[02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000]  it's much bigger than that
[02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:34.000]  and in the next few years we're going to have to open our minds to that
[02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:37.000]  and a lot of this technology that they're using
[02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:40.000]  which is way beyond anything they're admitting to
[02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:43.000]  is not necessarily only coming from human
[02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000]  sources you know
[02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000]  because they've been doing things for a long long time
[02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000]  that have been high tech
[02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000]  in the areas we're talking about
[02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000]  manipulating the Earth's energy field
[02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000]  and therefore everyone within it for a long time
[02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000]  this is some European Parliament
[02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000]  report on HAAP
[02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000]  from about 1990
[02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000]  it says at one point here
[02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000]  this is from the European Parliament
[02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000]  from the 1950s
[02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000]  the USA conducted explosions
[02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000]  of nuclear material in the Val Allen belts
[02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000]  to investigate the effects
[02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000]  of the electromagnetic pulse generated
[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000]  by nuclear weapons explosions
[02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000]  at these heights on radio communications
[02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000]  and the operation of radar
[02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000]  this created
[02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000]  new magnetic radiation belts
[02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000]  which covered nearly the whole Earth
[02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000]  the electrons traveled along
[02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000]  magnetic lines of force
[02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000]  and created an artificial aurora
[02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000]  baryalis above the North Pole
[02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000]  these military tests are liable
[02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000]  to disrupt the Val Allen belt for a long period
[02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000]  the Earth's magnetic field
[02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000]  could be disrupted over large areas
[02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000]  which would obstruct radio communications
[02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000]  according to US scientists
[02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000]  it could take hundreds of years
[02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000]  for the Val Allen belt to return to normal
[02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000]  HAAP could result in changes
[02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000]  in weather patterns
[02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000]  it could also influence whole ecosystems
[02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000]  especially in sensitive
[02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000]  Antarctic regions that it's talking about
[02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000]  here
[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000]  the way that it shoots holes in the ionosphere
[02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000]  and allows incoming cosmic radiation
[02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000]  etc.
[02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000]  they did those experiments Alex
[02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000]  in the 1950s
[02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000]  well let me stop you
[02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000]  in the film Trinity narrated by
[02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000]  Captain Kirk
[02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000]  by William Shatner
[02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000]  that's aired on Discovery Channel
[02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000]  now 15 years ago
[02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000]  they showed the government footage of it
[02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000]  in one night firing 10 high powered nukes
[02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000]  into the Val Allen radiation belt
[02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000]  and then exploding in space as big white balls
[02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.000]  and they said that many of the scientists
[02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000]  thought it would probably destroy the atmosphere
[02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000]  on the Earth but they still did it
[02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000]  now they claim that the Hadron Collider
[02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000]  has created a new form of matter
[02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000]  in fact I forgot to cover that guys
[02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000]  just saying a new form of matter found
[02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000]  at superconducting supercollider
[02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000]  that was out two days ago
[02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000]  and then they go on to say when they first detonated
[02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000]  the first A-bomb around half the scientists
[02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000]  thought it was going to ignite the atmosphere
[02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000]  and kill everybody on Earth
[02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000]  but they still did it
[02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000]  and then I read this dark poetry
[02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000]  out of transhumanist top people
[02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000]  saying yes we may destroy the Earth
[02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000]  but they're going to go on willing
[02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000]  yeah well of course
[02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000]  a lot of these people
[02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000]  in fact the vast majority of these people
[02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000]  are utterly insane
[02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000]  they're just absolutely crazy
[02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000]  which makes it far more
[02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000]  difficult to reason
[02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000]  with them because they have no sense
[02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000]  of reason
[02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000]  it's something
[02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000]  that the massive humanity
[02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000]  will not be able to really understand
[02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000]  how these people can look
[02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000]  through their eyes
[02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000]  and look at the same thing we look at
[02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000]  and see a completely different picture
[02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000]  they don't see the world the way we see it
[02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000]  they don't see life the way we see it
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000]  they don't see anything the way we see it
[02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000]  and by the way that supercollider
[02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000]  in France
[02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000]  and across Switzerland
[02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000]  on the French border there
[02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000]  that's also about
[02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000]  manipulating the Earth's energy field
[02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000]  and other things
[02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000]  because of what it would
[02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000]  the effect that it would have
[02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000]  upon the Earth's magnetic field
[02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000]  and its energy field in general
[02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000]  there's a war going on Alex
[02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000]  on the Earth's magnetic field
[02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000]  and the energy field that humans live in
[02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000]  and it's a war that's been building up
[02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000]  for a long time
[02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000]  and we're now starting to put the pieces together
[02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000]  and see it
[02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000]  incredible and we've read all these patents on air
[02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000]  where the light bulbs they're mandating go in
[02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000]  will be used for data to go over them
[02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000]  through the power lines flickering
[02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000]  programming your computers
[02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000]  accessing them and programming you
[02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000]  through your eyes
[02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000]  and the first places they're testing them
[02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000]  in Texas and Minnesota are police departments
[02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000]  and these are literally
[02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000]  mesmerizing mind control systems
[02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.000]  in the news and the cops
[02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.000]  are in there right now
[02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000]  it's Buck Rogers folks
[02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000]  we're on the march
[02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.000]  the Empire's on the run
[02:29:55.000 --> 02:30:01.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000]  in fact
[02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000]  Barron's called his work
[02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000]  a dire prophecy
[02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:33.000]  recently he created a video
[02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.000]  which you can watch online for free
[02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.000]  detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet
[02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.000]  and it's a real eye-opener
[02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000]  I can't stress this enough
[02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.000]  you should at least watch this free video online today
[02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:45.000]  he explains everything you need to know

[02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.000]  have experienced emergencies and disasters

[02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:21.000]  you must act automatically
[02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000]  after engine fails in flight
[02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000]  no time to think, just act automatically
[02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000]  when the alert is broadcast

[02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000]  the United States has now recognized globally
[02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000]  as one of the most oppressive police states

[02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:21.000]  and so much of what he wrote about
[02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:23.000]  15, 16, 17 years ago has unfortunately come true
[02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000]  and you know
[02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000]  what do christians say? they say there's an evil
[02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000]  force, the fallen one
[02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:31.000]  lucifer with his angels
[02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:33.000]  and you read
[02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.000]  what's in genesis and ezekiel
[02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000]  and they're saying they manipulated
[02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000]  humans genetics
[02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000]  i don't go there

[02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:53.000]  it comes out the government's doing it and covering it up
[02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000]  but the news calmly reports it
[02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000]  there have been caught since the 50s
[02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.000]  adding cancer viruses to vaccines

[02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.000]  putting the same systems
[02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:13.000]  in waging war against everybody
[02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000]  dumbing everybody down
[02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000]  and now david they've entered a phase of
[02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000]  flaunting it
[02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000]  more and more they come out and make absurdist statements about
[02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000]  george soros is a humanitarian
[02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.000]  he helped nazis round people up
[02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000]  and if you don't like it you're a nazi
[02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.000]  let me just expand bravely, you're staying with us 20 minutes to the next hour
[02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000]  so we can continue
[02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.000]  they come out and mom biot says now that these reactors blew up
[02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:35.000]  i think we need more
[02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:37.000]  of radiation
[02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000]  and colter says the people of japan should be thankful
[02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.000]  for their radiation
[02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000]  it's good for you
[02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.000]  it seems like they're trying to sell us on insanity
[02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000]  and getting us ready for even crazier
[02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.000]  things to happen where they just giggle
[02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000]  and snicker and run around
[02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000]  and al-qaeda is now
[02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000]  our friend in libyan if you don't like al-qaeda
[02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:57.000]  you're un-american
[02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:59.000]  they're just throwing it all and all
[02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:01.000]  yeah the banks launder the drugs
[02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000]  and if we catch you with them we're putting you in prison
[02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:05.000]  it's not a complete flaunting
[02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:07.000]  as they're almost trying to sell
[02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.000]  delusion where everything's so confusing
[02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000]  people just go into a catatonic state
[02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000]  well that's the word
[02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000]  confusion
[02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000]  the idea is to create
[02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000]  so much upheaval in people's lives
[02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000]  so many shocks
[02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:23.000]  so many things to fear
[02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000]  and to keep pumping them out
[02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000]  and we're in that phase now my goodness me
[02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000]  look at it and we're going further into it
[02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.000]  before we turn this around
[02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000]  so that people are so
[02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:35.000]  shocked are so
[02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000]  in fear and so
[02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000]  overwhelmed
[02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000]  almost a fear version
[02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:43.000]  of information overload
[02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000]  that they just switch off and enter
[02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000]  a state of acquiescence
[02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000]  like a mouse
[02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:51.000]  in a laboratory maze
[02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:53.000]  that has so many shocks
[02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.000]  going down certain channels
[02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000]  in the maze it suddenly stops
[02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000]  and its behavior is
[02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000]  rewired and you can take the shock
[02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000]  equipment away it ain't going to go down those
[02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.000]  channels again you have
[02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000]  rewired its
[02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.000]  perception its behavior
[02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000]  and this is what it's about it's about
[02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.000]  as many shocks as possible
[02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.000]  and that's why we have to stay calm
[02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000]  and we have to stay
[02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000]  strong and not fall
[02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.000]  for this not fall into
[02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:23.000]  this shock
[02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000]  created acquiescence because
[02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000]  when people are in fear
[02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000]  they invariably
[02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000]  if they're not strong within themselves
[02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:33.000]  they'll look for someone
[02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.000]  to protect them
[02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:37.000]  from what they've been manipulated to fear
[02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000]  and therefore they'll give their power
[02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000]  to that someone or that something
[02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.000]  as almost like
[02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000]  an exchange for protection
[02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000]  now what we're looking at now
[02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.000]  is humanity as a whole being
[02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000]  collectively hit
[02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:53.000]  by these multi-shocks and multi-reasons
[02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000]  to fear and the idea is to get
[02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000]  a collective version of that
[02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000]  which is you give
[02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.000]  your power away to who you think
[02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:03.000]  can sort the mess out or protect you from
[02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.000]  what you're fear and it's
[02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000]  no accident that it's in this period where
[02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.000]  they're playing this collective mind game
[02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:11.000]  this collective behavior
[02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:13.000]  acquiescence
[02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000]  mind operation
[02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.000]  that they're coming out with all these
[02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.000]  key areas like you said
[02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:21.000]  George Soros is going to be pushing
[02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000]  the global long-plan
[02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000]  global economic structure
[02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000]  and what we're seeing now in the Middle East
[02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000]  is the world army
[02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.000]  being more and more
[02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000]  into the fold
[02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:35.000]  and the perfect pretext I want to stop you
[02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.000]  I want you to go back into Soros because he is announcing
[02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000]  a global banking regulatory system
[02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000]  run by the very bankers that have engineered the crisis
[02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000]  now being our saviors
[02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.000]  you also send us a map you want us to put on screen
[02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000]  for viewers not just listeners
[02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:49.000]  to talk about that world army
[02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000]  so let's go over Soros first then into this world map
[02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000]  okay well
[02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000]  what
[02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000]  I've been talking about and I've been talking about
[02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000]  for a long time
[02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000]  and it's even in their own document
[02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:03.000]  the plan is to
[02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000]  I think we talked about this at some point
[02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.000]  the last time Alex
[02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000]  the plan is to
[02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000]  make governments
[02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000]  irrelevant to
[02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:15.000]  sorting out economic situations
[02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000]  created by this
[02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000]  cabal of bankers
[02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000]  and therefore the bankers
[02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000]  I mean crikey I mean it's like
[02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.000]  it's like deja vu
[02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:27.000]  what we're seeing now
[02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.000]  because what we've been pointing out
[02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000]  was coming is now
[02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000]  happening on the news
[02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000]  the idea was I said in 2008
[02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000]  there's a three point plan here one is to crash the economy
[02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.000]  2008 September
[02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000]  so people know there's a problem
[02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:43.000]  secondly manipulating governments
[02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.000]  to throw vast
[02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000]  amounts of money
[02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000]  they borrowed money at the banks
[02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000]  to
[02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000]  make the governments reach a point
[02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000]  where they can no longer
[02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000]  even
[02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000]  ludicrously in throwing money at the banks
[02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000]  they can no longer react
[02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:03.000]  we're now in that point because
[02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000]  now governments all over the world are introducing
[02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000]  my goodness me in this country
[02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000]  Britain
[02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000]  austerity programs which are taking away
[02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000]  the basic
[02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000]  basic benefits from the most
[02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000]  vulnerable of people who have been made
[02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000]  more vulnerable by
[02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000]  the economic crash caused by the banks
[02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000]  and so the governments
[02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000]  are in that stage two
[02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.000]  I was talking about now where they
[02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000]  they cannot react
[02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000]  and the idea stage three
[02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:33.000]  is to create
[02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000]  another massive economic crash
[02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000]  governments have no
[02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:39.000]  response
[02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000]  ability at all so the bankers
[02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:43.000]  people like Soros
[02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000]  frontman for the Rothschilds
[02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000]  come forward and say
[02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000]  this is how we must sort it out
[02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000]  and he's now openly making
[02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000]  those overtures as you mentioned
[02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000]  earlier so we're
[02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000]  seeing this reaching another level
[02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000]  of playing out where
[02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000]  the predictions
[02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000]  the some time over the rainbow
[02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000]  is now in our face
[02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000]  and we're seeing it and what's happening
[02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:09.000]  in the
[02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.000]  the Middle East Alex I'll put the
[02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000]  picture up on the screen
[02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000]  that picture
[02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000]  is of countries that are
[02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000]  and there are more
[02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000]  that are targeted to be taken over
[02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000]  by the NATO
[02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000]  European Union
[02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000]  North American
[02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000]  and when I say that
[02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000]  it's not the British doing this
[02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000]  or the Americans doing this
[02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000]  it's being done through
[02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:37.000]  those countries
[02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000]  using those countries
[02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000]  the American government
[02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000]  and the British government and the French government
[02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000]  with also Cozy and stuff
[02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000]  they're just satellites of this global cabal
[02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.000]  they're not representatives of the people of those countries
[02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000]  they were captured by the banking cartel
[02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000]  many centuries ago many of them
[02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000]  yes they were
[02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:57.000]  they're vehicles and the
[02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.000]  governments of the world
[02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.000]  are the vast majority
[02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000]  of them anyway and they want to make it all of them
[02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:05.000]  are actually like transnational
[02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000]  corporations, subsidiary companies
[02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000]  of the global
[02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000]  you know company
[02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:13.000]  and they carry out the orders
[02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.000]  of the centrally dictated
[02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000]  headquarters of this network
[02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000]  and that's why as you pointed out earlier
[02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000]  we're seeing the same things
[02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:23.000]  being introduced in countries all over the world
[02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.000]  at the same time this is how it's done
[02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:27.000]  and if we look at that map
[02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.000]  first of all it's worth looking to the right
[02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000]  where Somalia and Ethiopia
[02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000]  and a place called Djibouti
[02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000]  just across the sea from Yemen
[02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.000]  that is the
[02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.000]  African base
[02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:41.000]  of AFRICOM
[02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:43.000]  what the American military
[02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.000]  and the American military too
[02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.000]  is just a satellite military of the global cabal
[02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:49.000]  they call it the American military but it's not
[02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:51.000]  it has all that money
[02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000]  spent on it
[02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.000]  fantastic amounts of money
[02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000]  so it basically spends more money on the military
[02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000]  America than the rest of the world
[02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000]  well notice the French have now invaded
[02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000]  via NATO
[02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.000]  most that are backing the rebels slaughtering people
[02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000]  this is AFRICOM moving into Africa
[02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000]  exactly but the reason
[02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:11.000]  so much fantastic
[02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:13.000]  amounts of money are spent
[02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:15.000]  on the American military
[02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000]  is not for the benefit of the American people
[02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000]  it's because that is
[02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000]  the moment the main
[02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000]  point of
[02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000]  military
[02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.000]  imposition for the cabal
[02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000]  and of course Britain being one of the great
[02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.000]  centers of the cabal not the British government
[02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000]  but the city of London etc
[02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000]  it's always in the
[02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000]  slipstream of America when it goes
[02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000]  into a country
[02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000]  so from AFRICOM
[02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.000]  it was created
[02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.000]  during the Boyd Bush administration
[02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.000]  and the question is
[02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.000]  why has America got
[02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000]  an African command
[02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000]  well it's Africa
[02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000]  well the idea is to pick these countries off
[02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.000]  and speaking of Brzezinski
[02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:59.000]  in his book Grand Chess Board in 1998
[02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:01.000]  he said
[02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000]  that the key area
[02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000]  to control the world is
[02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000]  what he calls Eurasia
[02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.000]  Eurasia is basically Europe
[02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000]  across to China and then down into
[02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:13.000]  the Middle East and what we've seen Alex
[02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:15.000]  over the last many many years
[02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:17.000]  is that process
[02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:19.000]  of picking off
[02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.000]  key areas of Eurasia
[02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:23.000]  and now they're moving into Africa
[02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:25.000]  what they want for a start
[02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:27.000]  is to take the whole of those North African countries
[02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:29.000]  like Morocco, Algeria, Libya
[02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:31.000]  Egypt where of course they've had
[02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:33.000]  the trouble
[02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:35.000]  there's now protests in Jordan
[02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:37.000]  and Syria they're the target countries too
[02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:39.000]  they've got Iraq
[02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:41.000]  they're in there and then Bingo
[02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000]  there's the big one to the right of Iraq
[02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:45.000]  Iran
[02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.000]  they're already in Afghanistan
[02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:49.000]  they're totally
[02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.000]  coldly destabilizing
[02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.000]  Pakistan and then just off that map
[02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:55.000]  you're hitting the Chinese border
[02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:57.000]  and these countries
[02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.000]  are being systematically targeted
[02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:01.000]  and what they're doing in the Muslim world
[02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.000]  is playing off
[02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.000]  the divisions going back goodness
[02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:07.000]  me tell me it's not true
[02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.000]  to the 7th century between the
[02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:11.000]  Shia Muslims and the Sunni Muslims
[02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:13.000]  and the reason that Saudi Arabia
[02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:15.000]  and people like the United Arab Emirates
[02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:17.000]  are being allowed
[02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:19.000]  to go into Bahrain and
[02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:21.000]  commit terrible atrocities
[02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000]  to suppress the people's
[02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:25.000]  rebellion in Bahrain
[02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:27.000]  and being allowed to do it with no reaction
[02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:29.000]  and no condemnation
[02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:31.000]  what everything's targeted on Libya
[02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:33.000]  is because they want to
[02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:35.000]  Saudi Arabia that is overwhelmingly
[02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:37.000]  a Sunni Muslim country
[02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:39.000]  and others around it
[02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.000]  they want to use them in their targeting
[02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.000]  of Iran which is really the center
[02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:45.000]  of the Shiite Muslim world
[02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:47.000]  it's dominated the Iran
[02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:49.000]  by Shiite Muslims and so
[02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.000]  once they get Iran
[02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:53.000]  and this is the irony
[02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:55.000]  if they get Iran by using Saudi Arabia
[02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.000]  and these others to support that
[02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:59.000]  then Saudi Arabia will be the next one to go
[02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:01.000]  because there won't be any use
[02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.000]  to the Qabbal and the agenda anymore
[02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:05.000]  and at the moment we've got this
[02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000]  extraordinary situation really
[02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:09.000]  where the United Arab Emirates
[02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:11.000]  has sent planes
[02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:13.000]  to join the NATO
[02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000]  force to protect civilians
[02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:17.000]  it says in Libya
[02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:19.000]  while at the same time they've sent their troops
[02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:21.000]  to stop
[02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:23.000]  civilians with violence
[02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:25.000]  it's incredible
[02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:27.000]  I want to stop you just briefly and remind folks
[02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:29.000]  that at the Obama deception that came out two years ago
[02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.000]  all the republic that came out
[02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:33.000]  a year ago
[02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:35.000]  we predict with our experts in both these
[02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:37.000]  films that Afrikan
[02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.000]  would launch wars
[02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:41.000]  all over Africa starting in North Africa
[02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.000]  Webster terribly predicted that
[02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000]  with precision off followings
[02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.000]  and other people's statements
[02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:49.000]  you can show people these two DVDs
[02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:51.000]  and explain to them look at the date of it
[02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:53.000]  and that's what really gets people's attention
[02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:55.000]  is that we understand the globalist program
[02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.000]  David I watch CNN
[02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:59.000]  Fox you name it now
[02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:01.000]  it is so dumb down
[02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:03.000]  but what's scary is you have J. Rockefeller
[02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:05.000]  all these other globalists saying they want to shut down the alternative media now
[02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:07.000]  they are scared
[02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:09.000]  because we're not dumb down
[02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:11.000]  we're watching what they're actually doing
[02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:13.000]  and they're beginning to panic
[02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:15.000]  yes absolutely but you know
[02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:17.000]  in Libya what's happening there now
[02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:19.000]  Alex is a classic
[02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:21.000]  kind of
[02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:23.000]  accumulation of so many things
[02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:25.000]  that pull this together
[02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:27.000]  first of all Libya
[02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.000]  I've got no brief for Colonel Gaddafi
[02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:31.000]  I want all dictators to disappear
[02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:33.000]  but if we're going to be street wise
[02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:35.000]  we have to see the shades of grey
[02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000]  within the black and white that is
[02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.000]  given to us on the television news
[02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:41.000]  and they have a central bank which issues the currency
[02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:43.000]  and
[02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:45.000]  when you do business with Libya
[02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:47.000]  you go through the central bank
[02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:49.000]  that's the last thing this cabal of global bankers want
[02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:51.000]  and it is no
[02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.000]  accident that
[02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:55.000]  these rebels
[02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000]  who kind of appeared out of nowhere
[02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:59.000]  and there will be genuine people among them
[02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:01.000]  who want to end that
[02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:03.000]  Gaddafi oppression
[02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:05.000]  but they're just walking into another oppression
[02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.000]  if they're not street wise or if they're not
[02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.000]  but within those rebels
[02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:11.000]  there's no way that
[02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.000]  is adding up when you've got
[02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:15.000]  people apparently being bombed from the sky
[02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:17.000]  and there's a no fly zone
[02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:19.000]  to help them and all that stuff
[02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:21.000]  and yet at the same time
[02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:23.000]  this rebel group have managed to
[02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:25.000]  create a new Libyan central bank
[02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:29.000]  and also
[02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:31.000]  a new Libyan oil company
[02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:33.000]  they've already signed an oil deal
[02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:35.000]  with Qatar
[02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:37.000]  and the European Union has said
[02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:39.000]  to Egypt after this so called
[02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:41.000]  revolution that wasn't
[02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:43.000]  but of course if you make the necessary
[02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:45.000]  economic reforms
[02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:47.000]  then we'll give you loans
[02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:49.000]  which will put you massively in debt to us
[02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:51.000]  and that's the idea
[02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:53.000]  so the idea is to
[02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:55.000]  take over these countries and any that are
[02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:57.000]  not totally
[02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000]  kind of sucked in and absorbed
[02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:01.000]  by the global banking system
[02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.000]  well they will be that's the idea
[02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.000]  and that's why Libya
[02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:07.000]  is being targeted and not the other countries
[02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000]  but they will be in the end
[02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.000]  they won't belittle the whole of Africa
[02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:13.000]  absolutely and expanding on that
[02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:15.000]  this sets an incredible precedent
[02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:17.000]  where the UN puts out a resolution
[02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:19.000]  within 48 hours or less
[02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.000]  a new war is launched
[02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.000]  and the rebels were publicly backed
[02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:25.000]  the core of them by British intelligence
[02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:27.000]  SAS, US CIA
[02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.000]  that's now all been admitted
[02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:31.000]  and so what a precedent the globalist
[02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000]  financed some rebels
[02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:35.000]  and now it sets the precedent where NATO
[02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:37.000]  and the US come in and bomb them
[02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:39.000]  and then overtake the country
[02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:41.000]  this is an incredible precedent
[02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:43.000]  and a big move forward toward the global government
[02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:45.000]  when you start absorbing these things
[02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:47.000]  like NATO and
[02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:49.000]  the United Nations
[02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:51.000]  I said years and years ago
[02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:53.000]  basically the United Nations peacekeeping operation
[02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:55.000]  often the opposite
[02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:57.000]  and the NATO operation were going to be
[02:48:57.000 --> 02:48:59.000]  absorbed into one eventually
[02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:01.000]  and we'd call it
[02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:03.000]  the world army
[02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:05.000]  there are other elements to it too
[02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:07.000]  but certainly the absorption of that
[02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:09.000]  and you've just described what's just happened
[02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:11.000]  the UN have a decision
[02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:13.000]  and then the NATO
[02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:15.000]  are now carrying out that decision in effect
[02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:17.000]  we're already into world
[02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.000]  we're already into world government
[02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:21.000]  it's implementing it through the nation states
[02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:23.000]  they control through the IMF World Bank UN
[02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:25.000]  we're already in the world government
[02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:27.000]  they're picking off the last countries they didn't control
[02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:29.000]  yes
[02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:31.000]  and the key one they want
[02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:33.000]  is Iran
[02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:35.000]  because that's vital
[02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:37.000]  not just to control of the region
[02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:39.000]  but also it's in that area
[02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:41.000]  around the Caspian Sea
[02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:43.000]  going up to you know Georgia
[02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:45.000]  another George Soros
[02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:47.000]  Brazilian revolution
[02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:49.000]  put that guy Sharkas Bali in
[02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:51.000]  who's just a frontman for him
[02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:53.000]  and all these other countries around the Caspian Sea
[02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:55.000]  where there are fantastic reserves of oil
[02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:57.000]  and gas
[02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000]  so if this map
[02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:01.000]  you can carry around with them
[02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:03.000]  or keep it with them
[02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.000]  unless something intervenes here
[02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:07.000]  they can start ticking these countries off
[02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:09.000]  because it's not
[02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:11.000]  that's not a real map to them
[02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:13.000]  it's a wish list
[02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:15.000]  that's what it is
[02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:17.000]  David I want to shift gears into some other issues
[02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:19.000]  when we come back but you're absolutely spot on here
[02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.000]  but what about Obama
[02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:23.000]  the peace prize winner
[02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:25.000]  now they're talking about another peace prize
[02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:27.000]  so now war is peace
[02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:29.000]  well this is the
[02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:31.000]  the mind game that's going on Alex
[02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:33.000]  that we've been talking about
[02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.000]  the idea is
[02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.000]  to manipulate
[02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:39.000]  people's sense of perception
[02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:41.000]  so they do actually see
[02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:43.000]  that opposites are
[02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:45.000]  not opposites
[02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:47.000]  but actually are the same like war is peace
[02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:49.000]  oh it's
[02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:51.000]  it's amazing to watch it
[02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:53.000]  and liberals praising Soros
[02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:55.000]  because he helped round people up to the Nazis
[02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:57.000]  say if you're not for that you're a Nazi
[02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:59.000]  I mean this is total mind control
[02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:01.000]  we'll be right back
[02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:05.000]  are you still a traditional smoker

[02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:03.000]  the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster
[02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:05.000]  that killed thousands of Japanese citizens
[02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:07.000]  is nothing compared to the devastation
[02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:09.000]  that could be caused by hyperinflation
[02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:11.000]  that will soon hit the United States
[02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:13.000]  and could lead to millions of Americans
[02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:15.000]  becoming homeless
[02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:17.000]  all caused by the devalued US dollar
[02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:19.000]  while the mainstream media continues to ignore inflation
[02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:21.000]  our friends at the National Inflation Association

[02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:35.000]  but prosper during the upcoming hyperinflation crisis
[02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:37.000]  silver has more than doubled
[02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:39.000]  since the NIA declared silver the best investment
[02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:41.000]  for the next decade
[02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:43.000]  on inflation.us

[02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:21.000]  because over 60% of municipal water
[02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:23.000]  is fluoridated and it less than 2 cents per gallon
[02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:25.000]  Berkey water filters purify both treated
[02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:27.000]  and untreated water
[02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:29.000]  removing dangerous chlorine, fluoride
[02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:31.000]  and other contaminants. Big Berkey water filters
[02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:33.000]  are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water
[02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:35.000]  so they're perfect for rainwater
[02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:37.000]  collection systems and emergency preparedness
[02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:39.000]  remember Big Berkey includes

[02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:09.000]  we were just talking about the Orwellian way
[02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:11.000]  by design they're training you
[02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:13.000]  to be a slave
[02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:15.000]  when they go before the city council
[02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:17.000]  and point out with medical doctors a 7-fold increase
[02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:19.000]  in bone cancer from fluoride
[02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:21.000]  in the water they laugh
[02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:23.000]  when you go with CBS news about them putting
[02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:25.000]  uranium in Texas water knowingly
[02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:27.000]  they laugh they know full well
[02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:29.000]  they enjoy it it's all part of the fun
[02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:31.000]  now remember they've got trip ships
[02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:33.000]  off the coast a marine corps general
[02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:35.000]  two weeks ago said they are preparing to invade
[02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:37.000]  the UN resolution they say
[02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:39.000]  well it's going to be a ground force of peace
[02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:41.000]  they will never ground invade
[02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:43.000]  we will invade but the military bombing
[02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:45.000]  is a kinetic action not a bombing
[02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:47.000]  and we're going to invade
[02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:49.000]  but we're not going to invade
[02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:51.000]  and you go but you're using double speak there
[02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:53.000]  and they go no I'm not conspiracy theorist
[02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:55.000]  being able to breathe
[02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:57.000]  is a conspiracy theory being able to tie your shoelaces
[02:54:57.000 --> 02:54:59.000]  is a conspiracy theory being able to go
[02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:01.000]  raising safe radiation levels
[02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:03.000]  25,000 times EPA
[02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:05.000]  because the levels are going up on the west coast
[02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:07.000]  that doesn't still make it safe
[02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:09.000]  and the old level was dangerous
[02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:11.000]  and they go no you're a conspiracy theorist
[02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:13.000]  I'm George Monbiott I now love radiation
[02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:15.000]  ha ha ha I'm encultured
[02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:17.000]  ha ha ha and they're just counting on you to go
[02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:19.000]  okay here is CBS news
[02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:21.000]  just out going up on info wars dot com
[02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:23.000]  general
[02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:25.000]  US may consider troops in Libya
[02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:27.000]  our troops were there six weeks ago
[02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:29.000]  when this started the British troops
[02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:31.000]  the CIA they admittedly have al-Qaeda
[02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:33.000]  as the vanguard army general
[02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:35.000]  Carter Ham says ground forces
[02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:37.000]  wouldn't be ideal
[02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:39.000]  oh see first it would never do it to
[02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:41.000]  but may be possible with the aid of Webels
[02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:43.000]  says current operation largely
[02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:45.000]  stalemated oh so
[02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:47.000]  there's always been ground trips now the trip ships
[02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:49.000]  have arrived and and but they'll never
[02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:51.000]  be a ground invasion but there will be a
[02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:53.000]  ground invasion David
[02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:55.000]  I was looking at this the
[02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:57.000]  the other day in Britain they were
[02:55:57.000 --> 02:55:59.000]  making statements earlier on in this
[02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:01.000]  Libyan operation saying
[02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:03.000]  they wouldn't arm the rebels and then
[02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:05.000]  suddenly when the rebels started getting
[02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:07.000]  pushed back it was like
[02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:09.000]  oh well we can't rule it out
[02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:11.000]  we can't take it off the table
[02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:13.000]  and of course the question they'd already armed
[02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:15.000]  them before that no I know and
[02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:17.000]  but the thing is
[02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:19.000]  if this
[02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:21.000]  rebel army or what do you want to call it
[02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:23.000]  does not take the country
[02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:25.000]  and they're clearly not going to take the country
[02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:27.000]  the way things are going or anything like
[02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:29.000]  then they'll just up the ante and up the ante
[02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:31.000]  and up the ante and go back on assurances
[02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:33.000]  that they had before because the idea
[02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:35.000]  is to take the country and and
[02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:37.000]  that's what the whole thing
[02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:39.000]  is about and it's got so ludicrous
[02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:41.000]  I mean the thing is so ludicrous
[02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:43.000]  that the
[02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:45.000]  commander of the NATO operation
[02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:47.000]  speaking in Europe I think it was
[02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:49.000]  a few days ago he said that
[02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:51.000]  they were there
[02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:53.000]  to protect civilians and so
[02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:55.000]  they would also attack
[02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:57.000]  the rebels if they were
[02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:59.000]  killing civilians well it's now
[02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:01.000]  been shown very clearly there's another story
[02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:03.000]  today about
[02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:05.000]  this and another example
[02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:07.000]  that NATO bothers
[02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:09.000]  being killing civilians so
[02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:11.000]  NATO bombed themselves now in retaliation
[02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:13.000]  I mean the whole thing's insane
[02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:15.000]  but what we're seeing
[02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:17.000]  you were mentioned earlier about the mind game
[02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:19.000]  over the years
[02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:21.000]  you see where they'll say
[02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:23.000]  sugar's bad for you
[02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:25.000]  and that old sugar's bad for you
[02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:27.000]  and then they'll come out and say well no sugar's not bad for you
[02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:29.000]  and all that stuff and I remember my mother
[02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:31.000]  going years back where she's
[02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:33.000]  say oh they tell you this and then they tell you
[02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:35.000]  that I can't be doing with it
[02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:37.000]  people switch off because they're given this
[02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:39.000]  constantly
[02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:41.000]  reversed information
[02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:43.000]  it's good, it's bad, it's good, it's bad
[02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:45.000]  and eventually they're looking
[02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:47.000]  for a switch off point and that's what's going on
[02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:49.000]  with all this mind game this is why
[02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:51.000]  they're saying ludicrous things like radiation
[02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:53.000]  of fantastic levels is good
[02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:55.000]  for you and
[02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:57.000]  then it's bad for you and then it's good for you
[02:57:57.000 --> 02:57:59.000]  and eventually people switch off and think
[02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:01.000]  I can't be doing with it and what's that
[02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:03.000]  it's a form of acquiescence
[02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:05.000]  they've
[02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:07.000]  stopped taking part in the
[02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:09.000]  game, stopped taking part in the situation
[02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:11.000]  and become acquiescent to it
[02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:13.000]  well that's exactly what they're doing
[02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:15.000]  but they're doing it out of desperation
[02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:17.000]  because you've got one group of people
[02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:19.000]  getting more dumbed down, more
[02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:21.000]  servile, more prepared to accept
[02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:23.000]  up as down as up, black as white
[02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:25.000]  as black, war as peace, death as life
[02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:27.000]  but then you've got an even larger group
[02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:29.000]  beginning to form
[02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:31.000]  who's becoming more and more enlightened and astute
[02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:33.000]  and aware, 20 more minutes with David Ike

[02:58:49.000 --> 02:58:51.000]  when you're out on the road
[02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:53.000]  the last place you want to be
[02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:55.000]  is on the road
[02:58:57.000 --> 02:58:59.000]  but if the unfortunate happens
[02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:01.000]  you'll be glad you were wearing
[02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:03.000]  diamond gussets
[02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:05.000]  there's a place down in Tennessee
[02:59:07.000 --> 02:59:09.000]  where they make blue diamond gusset jeans
[02:59:11.000 --> 02:59:13.000]  they so pride in every stitch

[02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:23.000]  they put a diamond gusset in the crotch

[02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:27.000]  blue diamond gussets
[02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:29.000]  got it
[02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:31.000]  other stone
[02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:33.000]  we turned jeans inside out
[02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:35.000]  diamond gusset jeans
[02:59:35.000 --> 02:59:37.000]  made in the USA with unparalleled quality

[02:59:49.000 --> 02:59:51.000]  others don't
[02:59:51.000 --> 02:59:53.000]  coast to coast
[02:59:53.000 --> 02:59:55.000]  direct from Austin
[02:59:55.000 --> 02:59:59.000]  you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[02:59:59.000 --> 03:00:15.000]  we now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:17.000]  and the heart of the resistance
[03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:19.000]  rallying Patriots Worldwide
[03:00:19.000 --> 03:00:23.000]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:43.000]  we are back live
[03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:45.000]  now into our number four
[03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:47.000]  David Iksart Gas
[03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:49.000]  we were just talking during the break
[03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:53.000]  about the fact that the globalists are horrified
[03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:55.000]  one level is afraid of the next level
[03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:57.000]  and the next level in this pyramid
[03:00:57.000 --> 03:00:59.000]  in this psychopathic system
[03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:01.000]  David break that down
[03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:03.000]  the psychology of psychopaths
[03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:05.000]  and the sociopaths and sadists
[03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:07.000]  that work for them
[03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:09.000]  well it's a pyramid
[03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:11.000]  of terror really
[03:01:11.000 --> 03:01:13.000]  because one level
[03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:15.000]  has control over the next level
[03:01:15.000 --> 03:01:17.000]  and so that level is frightened of it
[03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:19.000]  but it's frightened of the level above it
[03:01:19.000 --> 03:01:21.000]  and it's frightened of the level above it
[03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:23.000]  and ultimately
[03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:25.000]  there is a spider in the center of the web
[03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:27.000]  we can discuss and have different views
[03:01:27.000 --> 03:01:29.000]  about what that spider is
[03:01:29.000 --> 03:01:31.000]  from which everything is coming out from
[03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:33.000]  but they are all
[03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:35.000]  absolutely terrified
[03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:37.000]  of that spider
[03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:39.000]  and the Rothschilds and families like that
[03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:41.000]  are very close to the spider
[03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:43.000]  which is one of the key reasons why
[03:01:43.000 --> 03:01:45.000]  within the structure
[03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:47.000]  it's terrified of the Rothschilds
[03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:49.000]  and do whatever they say
[03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:51.000]  so you look at these people
[03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:53.000]  like Soros
[03:01:53.000 --> 03:01:55.000]  on one level he will have power
[03:01:55.000 --> 03:01:57.000]  but he's carrying out
[03:01:57.000 --> 03:01:59.000]  an agenda
[03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:01.000]  for those much more powerful than him
[03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:03.000]  and woe be tied if he doesn't do it
[03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:05.000]  and doesn't do it the way he's told to do it
[03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:07.000]  and isn't successful
[03:02:07.000 --> 03:02:09.000]  in what he's told to do
[03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:11.000]  so they seem kind of arrogant
[03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:13.000]  on one level and I'm sure they are
[03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:15.000]  but there is this constant pyramid of fear
[03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:17.000]  and what they've done
[03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:19.000]  is transfer that
[03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:21.000]  structure if you like
[03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:23.000]  into human society if you look at it
[03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:25.000]  which is a society overwhelmingly based on fear
[03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:27.000]  fear of tomorrow
[03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:29.000]  fear of what's going to happen next week
[03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:31.000]  fear of this, fear of that
[03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:33.000]  the whole of human society is based on fear
[03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:35.000]  and it's a reflection
[03:02:35.000 --> 03:02:37.000]  of the structure
[03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:39.000]  that is controlling human society
[03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:41.000]  that is completely based on fear
[03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:43.000]  and like I say
[03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:45.000]  they're terrified of the Rothschilds
[03:02:45.000 --> 03:02:47.000]  when they come to call
[03:02:47.000 --> 03:02:49.000]  because the Rothschilds are so close to this spider
[03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:51.000]  whatever we choose to believe it is
[03:02:51.000 --> 03:02:53.000]  continuing
[03:02:53.000 --> 03:02:55.000]  what do you expect to see them doing
[03:02:55.000 --> 03:02:57.000]  now as they come more and more out in the open
[03:02:57.000 --> 03:02:59.000]  because we've already revealed them
[03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:01.000]  so now they've got to reveal themselves in their own way
[03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:03.000]  well I said this years ago
[03:03:03.000 --> 03:03:05.000]  there was always a time
[03:03:05.000 --> 03:03:07.000]  when they had no choice but to
[03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:09.000]  put it on public display
[03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:11.000]  because when you're
[03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:13.000]  manipulating over a long period of time
[03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:15.000]  behind the scenes
[03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:17.000]  in the shadows
[03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:19.000]  to turn the world into a certain
[03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:21.000]  structure into a certain way of operation
[03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:23.000]  a certain way of control
[03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:25.000]  and enforcement
[03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:27.000]  then there comes a time
[03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:29.000]  when that society
[03:03:29.000 --> 03:03:31.000]  has to start becoming
[03:03:31.000 --> 03:03:33.000]  obvious to people because
[03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:35.000]  if it doesn't then you're not going to introduce it
[03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:37.000]  and I said years ago
[03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:39.000]  there's going to come a window of time
[03:03:39.000 --> 03:03:41.000]  when we're going to see this
[03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:43.000]  come into public display
[03:03:43.000 --> 03:03:45.000]  and it's going to be undeniable
[03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:47.000]  where it's going and we're entering that
[03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:49.000]  period now very very quickly
[03:03:49.000 --> 03:03:51.000]  and the idea is
[03:03:51.000 --> 03:03:53.000]  to throw everything at us
[03:03:53.000 --> 03:03:55.000]  we must be strong
[03:03:55.000 --> 03:03:57.000]  we must be calm
[03:03:57.000 --> 03:03:59.000]  and not panic
[03:03:59.000 --> 03:04:01.000]  and not get caught in the whole wave
[03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:03.000]  of fear and all the rest of it
[03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:05.000]  there are in the period
[03:04:05.000 --> 03:04:07.000]  where they're going to throw everything
[03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:09.000]  at humanity
[03:04:09.000 --> 03:04:11.000]  to put us in a state of
[03:04:11.000 --> 03:04:13.000]  acquiescence
[03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:15.000]  that they can come along and say
[03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:17.000]  we are the people that can sort it out
[03:04:17.000 --> 03:04:19.000]  but to sort it out
[03:04:19.000 --> 03:04:21.000]  this is what's got to happen
[03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:23.000]  and also through these
[03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:25.000]  dumbing down constant
[03:04:25.000 --> 03:04:27.000]  shocks constant sources for fear
[03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:29.000]  and worry and terror
[03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:31.000]  to put people in the
[03:04:31.000 --> 03:04:33.000]  mental and emotional state
[03:04:33.000 --> 03:04:35.000]  of the mouse in the laboratory maze
[03:04:35.000 --> 03:04:37.000]  where we basically go into
[03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:39.000]  almost a zombie like state of
[03:04:39.000 --> 03:04:41.000]  acquiescence where we
[03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:43.000]  don't almost need controlling anymore
[03:04:43.000 --> 03:04:45.000]  because we've just basically
[03:04:45.000 --> 03:04:47.000]  gone into a zombie state
[03:04:47.000 --> 03:04:49.000]  and we will do whatever we're told to do
[03:04:49.000 --> 03:04:51.000]  and if people say
[03:04:51.000 --> 03:04:53.000]  that's not possible well it's happening
[03:04:53.000 --> 03:04:55.000]  in China I mean obviously people
[03:04:55.000 --> 03:04:57.000]  lining up in factories in China
[03:04:57.000 --> 03:04:59.000]  before going to war
[03:04:59.000 --> 03:05:01.000]  let's talk about when we come back

[03:05:07.000 --> 03:05:09.000]  communist movement is not dead
[03:05:09.000 --> 03:05:11.000]  as we've been told by the mass media
[03:05:11.000 --> 03:05:13.000]  they just feigned weakness back
[03:05:13.000 --> 03:05:15.000]  in 1989
[03:05:15.000 --> 03:05:17.000]  sent Gorbachev to America
[03:05:17.000 --> 03:05:19.000]  to continue his communist activities
[03:05:19.000 --> 03:05:21.000]  through infiltration in the

[03:05:49.000 --> 03:05:51.000]  these events are all
[03:05:51.000 --> 03:05:53.000]  happening right before our eyes
[03:05:53.000 --> 03:05:55.000]  you need to know
[03:05:55.000 --> 03:05:57.000]  Bible prophecy and how

[03:05:59.000 --> 03:06:01.000]  and yours

[03:06:05.000 --> 03:06:07.000]  century alone this is our last
[03:06:07.000 --> 03:06:09.000]  chance to not relive history
[03:06:09.000 --> 03:06:11.000]  as we're finishing off this agenda
[03:06:11.000 --> 03:06:13.000]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[03:06:13.000 --> 03:06:15.000]  Americans at home
[03:06:15.000 --> 03:06:17.000]  I've determined the most influence
[03:06:17.000 --> 03:06:19.000]  on our president in Congress
[03:06:19.000 --> 03:06:21.000]  and they really are calling the shots
[03:06:21.000 --> 03:06:23.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[03:06:23.000 --> 03:06:25.000]  as American citizens to pay attention
[03:06:25.000 --> 03:06:27.000]  fall of the republic identifies
[03:06:27.000 --> 03:06:29.000]  the enemies of our nation
[03:06:29.000 --> 03:06:31.000]  the criminal off-short cartel
[03:06:31.000 --> 03:06:33.000]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty
[03:06:33.000 --> 03:06:35.000]  and on its ashes constructing world
[03:06:35.000 --> 03:06:37.000]  government Tim Geithner, Bernanke
[03:06:37.000 --> 03:06:39.000]  they're arsonists, they're asking for more
[03:06:39.000 --> 03:06:41.000]  matches and the congress is saying
[03:06:41.000 --> 03:06:43.000]  who do we make the check out to?
[03:06:43.000 --> 03:06:45.000]  today seems like nobody does care
[03:06:45.000 --> 03:06:47.000]  and right now in Washington DC
[03:06:47.000 --> 03:06:49.000]  we have seen a fall of the republic

[03:08:00.000 --> 03:08:16.000]  music
[03:08:16.000 --> 03:08:18.000]  we've called it cognitive dissonance
[03:08:18.000 --> 03:08:20.000]  people being conditioned
[03:08:20.000 --> 03:08:22.000]  in their comfort zones to just parent
[03:08:22.000 --> 03:08:24.000]  and repeat what they've been told
[03:08:24.000 --> 03:08:26.000]  and as the corruption gets worse and worse
[03:08:26.000 --> 03:08:28.000]  people don't want to admit they've been conned
[03:08:28.000 --> 03:08:33.960]  So they burrow deeper into denial some people wake up the media calls this conspiracy terrorist
[03:08:34.160 --> 03:08:37.520]  Day one the West launched the attacks in Libya with the rebels. It's al-Qaeda
[03:08:37.640 --> 03:08:43.620]  They're getting ground troops ready the whole time the Marines admitted it two weeks ago now CBS news. They're getting ready to invade
[03:08:44.280 --> 03:08:46.280]  With ground troops have needed
[03:08:46.320 --> 03:08:48.320]  they've been there the whole time and
[03:08:48.560 --> 03:08:54.040]  Glenn Beck in his last show on Fox when he said he was being kicked off and then that's the inside things being kicked off
[03:08:54.040 --> 03:08:56.040]  He says they've decided he's gonna leave
[03:08:56.040 --> 03:09:00.360]  Because even that much truth was scaring the system. They tried to co-opt us. It didn't work
[03:09:00.800 --> 03:09:07.440]  Beck's now obsessing on the normalcy bias that we've talked about over the years the normalcy bias refers to mental state people
[03:09:07.440 --> 03:09:14.440]  Enter when facing a disaster it causes people to underestimate both the possibility of the disaster occurring and its possible effects
[03:09:14.440 --> 03:09:21.000]  And the famous cases are people as the buildings are smoking going back up 20 flights of stairs to turn their computer off their light off
[03:09:21.000 --> 03:09:26.120]  People on the Titanic saying it's sinking. It's listing things are falling off the deck
[03:09:26.760 --> 03:09:30.080]  Especially the rich people they were the worst the poor folks
[03:09:30.080 --> 03:09:36.600]  They were all abandoning ship if they could they would go back in their suits and smoke a cigar saying everything would be fine
[03:09:36.600 --> 03:09:38.600]  the authorities will fix it and
[03:09:39.000 --> 03:09:42.980]  So that's what's going on here. And so as things get crazier and crazier
[03:09:43.000 --> 03:09:48.360]  That's what David Ike's been talking about a lot of people are deciding to buy into anything
[03:09:48.360 --> 03:09:50.360]  into anything and
[03:09:51.840 --> 03:09:53.840]  Go ahead David
[03:09:55.600 --> 03:10:02.580]  The mental process is is simply I wish this wasn't happening so I'll convince myself that it's not
[03:10:02.600 --> 03:10:09.480]  That's the mental state and that's the worst thing we can do what we need to do is stand up and face it
[03:10:09.480 --> 03:10:16.680]  It is what it is until we recognize something as it is we can do nothing about it
[03:10:16.680 --> 03:10:20.640]  And and there are lots and lots of people no question
[03:10:20.640 --> 03:10:27.120]  You know, it's the lots of people are going to go into massive states of cognitive dissonance and denial
[03:10:27.120 --> 03:10:33.920]  They already are because they don't want to face the truth of what's happening. So they I'm gonna convince myself
[03:10:33.920 --> 03:10:36.520]  It's not true. And that's why a lot of people
[03:10:37.360 --> 03:10:44.600]  Like like I was get attacked because it's it's the equivalent of I don't want to hear it change the subject
[03:10:44.600 --> 03:10:49.480]  Okay, don't want to hear it and when people don't want to hear you saying something to them because
[03:10:50.000 --> 03:10:54.960]  They don't want to be reminded actually of what's going on and so some deep level they know is going on
[03:10:54.960 --> 03:10:58.720]  But they don't want to face it. This is the time when we're gonna see the wheat and the chaff
[03:10:58.720 --> 03:11:05.040]  This is the time when we're gonna see those that have the courage to stand up and those who just want to run away and hide
[03:11:05.680 --> 03:11:09.120]  Because we're now at the point that it's a fork in the road
[03:11:09.120 --> 03:11:11.960]  I've been talking about this for so many years the fork in the road
[03:11:11.960 --> 03:11:15.560]  We're gonna go that way or that way and it's choice time and that fork in the road
[03:11:15.920 --> 03:11:23.520]  In so many ways is are we gonna face this be strong calm and keep control of our own mind and perceptions?
[03:11:23.520 --> 03:11:28.720]  Or are we gonna go down that road and give it all away in the in the fake
[03:11:29.040 --> 03:11:34.920]  False idea and the false interest that somehow those that have created them are gonna protect us from it
[03:11:34.920 --> 03:11:38.280]  Well, David, I mean in closing here with about three four minutes left with you
[03:11:38.280 --> 03:11:42.840]  Look not just the lies about the wars or the WMDs or the banking system
[03:11:43.080 --> 03:11:48.280]  But we know that for at least four years. We've been in a global depression. We know the dollars being devalued
[03:11:49.080 --> 03:11:51.160]  We know gold and silver are going up
[03:11:51.160 --> 03:11:55.880]  But yuppies who didn't buy gold that was $300 an ounce or 600 or 800
[03:11:55.920 --> 03:12:01.040]  They will still get angry and make fun. I see them laughing at people that
[03:12:01.920 --> 03:12:03.840]  quadrupled their wealth
[03:12:03.840 --> 03:12:09.600]  Because they can't admit that they were wrong and it's the same thing with them saying the recession's been over since June of
[03:12:09.800 --> 03:12:12.000]  2009 almost two years ago
[03:12:12.640 --> 03:12:15.120]  Once they again buy into the lie
[03:12:15.360 --> 03:12:21.280]  They don't want to admit they're wrong as the economy falls apart and now the controlled corporate media more than ever
[03:12:21.760 --> 03:12:26.640]  It's telling us the economy is wonderful when the economy is not wonderful
[03:12:26.640 --> 03:12:31.720]  And when they are reorganizing it to make us totally controlled where they're cutting off the resources
[03:12:31.720 --> 03:12:37.920]  So we have to follow their orders, but what one of the reasons of course and there are many why they want people to think
[03:12:37.920 --> 03:12:42.680]  The economy is wonderful because they want to people to buy into the economy as they did
[03:12:43.280 --> 03:12:50.120]  Before and they run up to 2008 because they know if they're gonna crash it big time again or 29 or 29 gone
[03:12:50.560 --> 03:12:56.880]  Or 29. Yeah, they're drawing them in. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, they draw them in and that's what's happening now
[03:12:56.880 --> 03:13:00.120]  Everything's fine. Oh, we just in this in that what was that? What is it?
[03:13:00.120 --> 03:13:05.560]  Obama said we invest invest in the stock market, you know, this is the best time to do it and all that stuff
[03:13:05.560 --> 03:13:07.560]  And it was the worst time to really do it
[03:13:08.040 --> 03:13:11.120]  And certainly will be now because they they're gonna crash it again
[03:13:11.120 --> 03:13:17.480]  And this thing with Soros is is really bringing to the fore this point where they come forward
[03:13:17.480 --> 03:13:22.560]  Those have created the problem and say we're the one the only ones because governments can't look look
[03:13:22.920 --> 03:13:29.000]  We only ones that can solve it and and and you know people need to get wise to this and and and and stop
[03:13:29.000 --> 03:13:34.720]  Observing the prison being built and start to organize start to get organized in
[03:13:35.600 --> 03:13:42.360]  networks of non-cooperations so people don't cooperate together so people don't leave foreclosed houses when they're
[03:13:42.760 --> 03:13:47.480]  Foreclosed because they can't pay their rent because of what the banks did that they lost their jobs
[03:13:47.480 --> 03:13:53.800]  What kind of cycle if we'll if we'll accept that cycle and pack up and leave will accept anything and and
[03:13:54.440 --> 03:13:58.200]  these things for this mass non-cooperation needs to be
[03:13:58.200 --> 03:14:02.120]  Organized that that's the level but it will change it not mass marches
[03:14:02.120 --> 03:14:06.720]  I mean how many million people marches have marched against things and the things have happened anyway
[03:14:06.800 --> 03:14:12.920]  It's non-cooperation. They can't stand exactly David the media the controlled mind control media plays up
[03:14:12.960 --> 03:14:18.680]  That a march is the only way to do something. No, it's individually waking your friends up. It's buying organic food
[03:14:18.680 --> 03:14:23.360]  It's supporting alternative media. It's speaking out. It's calling in to talk radio
[03:14:23.360 --> 03:14:28.240]  It's going and speaking at your city council people all over the west are going to city councils
[03:14:28.520 --> 03:14:35.840]  Speaking out week after week month after month and in a few years. They're removing fluoride everywhere. This is done when we resist
[03:14:35.880 --> 03:14:41.840]  We have victory and that's the big secret how special and how powerful we are David Ike calm
[03:14:42.240 --> 03:14:45.040]  David, thank you for spending time with us and I really love them Alex
[03:14:45.040 --> 03:14:50.160]  I really look forward to speaking to you again in the future a 30-second closing comment. Well, I just
[03:14:50.160 --> 03:14:56.320]  Say about Obama. He's he's looking darker and more well kind of
[03:14:57.560 --> 03:15:02.280]  Zombie-like the more that I see him something something's clearly happening to him
[03:15:02.280 --> 03:15:05.560]  I see he's just said he wants four more years
[03:15:05.560 --> 03:15:08.920]  I'm not saying this will happen and I'm not making any predictions
[03:15:08.920 --> 03:15:12.760]  But I tell you what it wouldn't surprise me if at some port they took him out
[03:15:13.080 --> 03:15:18.320]  Because of what that would do to America and what they'd be able to justify in terms of homeland security in America
[03:15:18.320 --> 03:15:23.800]  Because he's on the way very very clearly to being a liability for them because he's been such big time
[03:15:23.800 --> 03:15:28.080]  So you're saying Obama could be the false flag. We'll talk to you again soon. Thank you David. Cheers, mate. Bye
[03:15:28.080 --> 03:15:31.280]  All right, there goes David Ike shifting gears for the balance of the five minutes

[03:15:36.640 --> 03:15:40.600]  By design into the banker receivership when they're the ones that owe the money
[03:15:40.600 --> 03:15:45.400]  And so they get to take over our country because they owe the money they created it
[03:15:45.400 --> 03:15:48.240]  They owe it, but they don't care gold
[03:15:49.240 --> 03:15:52.520]  Sencha's third record high in a row in the last three days
[03:15:53.480 --> 03:15:55.480]  absolutely power surging

[03:16:02.800 --> 03:16:05.160]  The European Central Bank interest rate hike
[03:16:06.040 --> 03:16:09.680]  All that that was thought that would lower gold our experts that would boost it
[03:16:09.680 --> 03:16:15.040]  Bringing up our resident expert and the owner of the Genesis Network and the owner of Midas Resources Ted Anderson
[03:16:15.560 --> 03:16:16.920]  Ted
[03:16:16.920 --> 03:16:23.080]  Every time they correct gold it only goes back up even more afterwards because the laws of mathematics the laws of the economy
[03:16:23.680 --> 03:16:31.840]  For three days you've been saying you're gonna pull this special of three silver dollar coins. That's a hundred and twenty-something dollar value
[03:16:32.600 --> 03:16:36.920]  Three of my best films sixty dollar value and ten dollars free shipping and handling
[03:16:36.920 --> 03:16:40.240]  That's a hundred and eighty dollar value for a hundred and ten dollars
[03:16:40.680 --> 03:16:43.320]  So seventy dollars off and you told me today

[03:17:05.080 --> 03:17:10.440]  Yeah, well, I guess you know, I just appreciate the fact that people want to read about the Fed and do something about well
[03:17:10.440 --> 03:17:15.960]  The point is that went up a little bit. You're about to go up on the three silver dollars three of my films and free shipping
[03:17:16.480 --> 03:17:22.160]  Tell folks where silver is right now. Yeah, currently silver right now is at three thirty nine fifty nine

[03:17:28.080 --> 03:17:32.640]  Alex one thing that I am going to raise the prices on is the walking Liberty half

[03:17:38.600 --> 03:17:42.960]  If you want to take advantage of something right now, that's going to be increasing in price
[03:17:42.960 --> 03:17:47.880]  That is a good coin to be getting into the other thing too is that DVD thing that we're talking about
[03:17:47.880 --> 03:17:49.880]  I mean, I'm just
[03:17:50.640 --> 03:17:53.640]  Impassioned with getting especially your movie end game

[03:18:16.200 --> 03:18:19.120]  I dare you and then on top of it three films and free shipping
[03:18:19.760 --> 03:18:22.160]  800 686 to 237
[03:18:22.160 --> 03:18:29.480]  1 800 686 to 3 7 there's a whole other list when you call since the Alex Jones radio special to get the older prices
[03:18:29.480 --> 03:18:35.440]  Their internet prices have gone up, but they're still incredibly good deals the Cree's from Jekyll Island silver dollars gone up
[03:18:35.440 --> 03:18:40.080]  Some still a smoking deal take action on these quickly Ted
[03:18:40.080 --> 03:18:44.640]  What are some of the other specials you've got a folks call? Well right now Frank said 311
[03:18:44.640 --> 03:18:46.120]  I they're much higher than that now
[03:18:46.120 --> 03:18:52.280]  They're about 315 pretty close now British sovereigns are 390 you're gonna pay well over that for those at this moment
[03:18:52.280 --> 03:18:55.040]  If you're like the older coins $20 liberties at
[03:18:55.040 --> 03:18:58.920]  1747 those have gone up closer to 1800
[03:18:58.920 --> 03:19:05.600]  I mean for the bags of survival bags of dimes currently right now are at 2940 and Ted
[03:19:05.600 --> 03:19:09.800]  Here's the difference you bought all this when it was lower knowing it's gonna go up
[03:19:09.800 --> 03:19:11.800]  You still sell at a low price when it goes up
[03:19:12.040 --> 03:19:17.440]  You've got this stuff on hand most brokers out there are taking people's orders and then trying to get it later
[03:19:17.600 --> 03:19:22.240]  You want to get this stuff right now Ted? You're shipping this stuff out quickly. Yeah shipping it out quickly
[03:19:22.240 --> 03:19:25.680]  The only thing we're getting hung up right now on is Silver Eagles, which is a problem
[03:19:25.680 --> 03:19:30.600]  But I tell you those walking Liberty haves if you're doing fast and you want to take advantage of something
[03:19:30.600 --> 03:19:32.600]  That's gonna go up. That's the coin right there
[03:19:33.040 --> 03:19:39.840]  Absolutely 800 six eight six two two three seven eight hundred six eight six two two three seven
[03:19:39.840 --> 03:19:41.440]  You're not gonna find a better deal anywhere
[03:19:41.440 --> 03:19:45.120]  I'd say buy them from us and support us support the alternative media that's under attack
[03:19:45.120 --> 03:19:49.240]  But at this price you're not really supporting us. These are Ted's lost leaders
[03:19:49.240 --> 03:19:54.880]  He wants to get you into silver and gold eight hundred six eight six two two three seven coming up linen LaRouche
[03:19:54.880 --> 03:20:20.880]  And then of course David Ike in the retransmission right after this break. Thank you so much Ted. See you back live everybody tomorrow.
