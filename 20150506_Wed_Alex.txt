[00:00.000 --> 00:13.180]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-offs you want answers well so does he
[00:13.180 --> 00:21.960]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.960 --> 00:34.480]  welcome to the Alex Jones show on this Thursday May 6 2015 I'm David Knight your
[00:34.480 --> 00:39.920]  host we have a very busy show today we're going to be joined by freeway
[00:39.920 --> 00:44.320]  Ricky Ross in the third hour he's gonna be here live in the studio we're gonna
[00:44.320 --> 00:47.640]  talk to him about the war on drugs and I think it'd be very interesting to talk
[00:47.640 --> 00:54.160]  to him about perspective of what's going on in Baltimore he's someone who came
[00:54.160 --> 00:59.600]  from a very poor family he got caught up in the war of drugs as I put it because
[00:59.600 --> 01:03.800]  we need to understand and freeway Ricky Ross is a great person to understand
[01:03.800 --> 01:09.360]  this that it is a war of drugs it's not a war on drugs it's a war of drugs our
[01:09.360 --> 01:14.640]  government as we can see when we talk to him is involved in creating and
[01:14.640 --> 01:20.160]  supplying the drugs as well as creating and supplying a police state a
[01:20.160 --> 01:24.600]  prison industrial state to take advantage of it most of our freedoms
[01:24.600 --> 01:28.760]  that have been lost the presidents for that were set in the war on drugs and
[01:28.760 --> 01:33.880]  so we need to pay very close attention to what prohibition has brought to us of
[01:33.880 --> 01:37.720]  course there's a big story up on info wars.com right now Facebook our Facebook
[01:37.720 --> 01:43.120]  account the Alex Jones Facebook account has been blocked for posting a picture go
[01:43.120 --> 01:47.800]  to the go to the site and take a look at it you can see at the top of info wars.com
[01:47.800 --> 01:51.240]  I'll try to describe this to the people who are listening on the radio it's a
[01:51.240 --> 01:55.400]  pretty amazing picture all it is is a Islamic flag in the background a guy
[01:55.400 --> 01:59.200]  with a hood over his head wearing some camo and a quote from Stalin there's no
[01:59.200 --> 02:02.120]  blood there's no violence there's nothing that anybody should be offended
[02:02.120 --> 02:06.720]  about unless perhaps maybe you are cultural Marxist and you don't like
[02:06.720 --> 02:10.960]  somebody talking about your hero Joseph Stalin the easiest way to gain control of
[02:10.960 --> 02:14.920]  a population is to carry out acts of terror it's also very easy to gain
[02:14.920 --> 02:18.440]  control the population when you censor free speech so we're gonna be talking
[02:18.440 --> 02:21.960]  about free speech there's a lot of free speech issues today in the news of course
[02:21.960 --> 02:26.600]  we've been talking about it all week because of the attack that happened in
[02:26.600 --> 02:31.080]  garland presumably against the freedom to mock and put out hateful speech I do
[02:31.080 --> 02:34.640]  think the speech was hateful but it's interesting to see how people are
[02:34.640 --> 02:38.720]  lining up on this of course the press came out and said you should have known
[02:38.720 --> 02:41.560]  you should not have provoked these people you should have known that drawing
[02:41.560 --> 02:46.800]  a cartoon that offended them would cause them to try to commit mass murder and
[02:46.800 --> 02:52.000]  she said well that was actually the point I was trying to make now we have an
[02:52.000 --> 02:56.040]  article we're gonna talk about later today there were actually Muslim leaders
[02:56.040 --> 02:59.080]  and the community and elsewhere that said that they supported her right to
[02:59.080 --> 03:04.160]  have that they did not disagree with the convention that they had drawing
[03:04.160 --> 03:08.240]  cartoons they said that's her right under the law nevertheless we now see that
[03:08.240 --> 03:13.080]  people like Franklin Graham Christian is coming out and saying they shouldn't be
[03:13.080 --> 03:15.640]  doing that kind of stuff now I don't think he's calling for the government to
[03:15.640 --> 03:19.840]  actually shut that down and censor it I understand where he's coming from I don't
[03:19.840 --> 03:25.160]  like to see Jesus mocked I'm a Christian I don't like it when Fox family guy
[03:25.160 --> 03:32.400]  mocks Jesus you can go to the Fox family guy wiki and you can see pages of the
[03:32.400 --> 03:38.720]  ways that they have mocked Jesus so they make a pretty much a career out of
[03:38.720 --> 03:42.680]  mocking Christianity in that particular cartoon I don't like it but I don't want
[03:42.680 --> 03:45.880]  the government to shut him down and of course nobody expects any Christians to
[03:45.880 --> 03:52.520]  come and murder the cartoonist at Fox not even the cartoonist at Fox News almost
[03:52.520 --> 03:57.000]  said Fox News but yeah there's a lot of cartoon reporters at Fox News we're gonna
[03:57.000 --> 04:02.640]  talk about what's happening with vaccines of course our bills in Vermont that
[04:02.640 --> 04:06.040]  they're pushing ahead other places like California that they're trying to take
[04:06.040 --> 04:10.920]  away our informed consent and I have to say that just like the Trans-Pacific
[04:10.920 --> 04:14.840]  Partnership if they're going to do things like the Trans-Pacific Partnership
[04:14.840 --> 04:19.040]  an absolute and total secrecy and of course we now see that Mitch McConnell is
[04:19.040 --> 04:22.760]  going to join with Obama that if they're going to do that an absolute total
[04:22.760 --> 04:27.920]  secrecy the answer ought to be an automatic no if they're telling us if
[04:27.920 --> 04:30.200]  they're telling our elected representatives as well that we're
[04:30.200 --> 04:33.800]  not stakeholders that ought to be an automatic no and when it comes to
[04:33.800 --> 04:36.840]  vaccines or any kind of medical treatment if they're going to give
[04:36.840 --> 04:40.960]  themselves legal immunity as they got in 1986 under Ronald Reagan and they're
[04:40.960 --> 04:44.320]  going to hold a gun to our head and force us to take vaccines the answer
[04:44.320 --> 04:59.600]  ought to be an automatic no stay with us we'll be right back
[04:59.600 --> 05:04.200]  the big problem with renewable energy like solar and wind is that it varies
[05:04.200 --> 05:07.920]  widely in output and there's no effective way to store the energy for
[05:07.920 --> 05:12.400]  ready availability that's why Elon Musk's Tesla has generated so much buzz
[05:12.400 --> 05:16.600]  about their powerwall battery system while the total cost of powerwall is
[05:16.600 --> 05:20.200]  still about three times the cost of power from the grid if it can achieve an
[05:20.200 --> 05:24.640]  economy of scale with large commercial users it could radically change power
[05:24.640 --> 05:29.000]  and allow people to get off the grid but another technology from Audi may be
[05:29.000 --> 05:33.400]  even far more disruptive Audi has refined a process from the 1920s that
[05:33.400 --> 05:37.600]  allows them to use renewable energy like solar to create a clean synthetic
[05:37.600 --> 05:43.520]  diesel fuel from water and CO2 they say it has no sulfur and burns cleanly but
[05:43.520 --> 05:48.040]  what I like most about it is that it consumes CO2 the boogeyman of the
[05:48.040 --> 05:53.640]  climate alarmists and it short circuits the schemes of carbon pimps like Al Gore
[05:53.640 --> 05:59.320]  I'm David Knight for Info Wars Nightly News and Prison Planet TV

[08:40.800 --> 08:47.080]  ladies and gentlemen it's already Wednesday May 6th 2015 Alex Jones here
[08:47.080 --> 08:52.520]  calling into my own show things have developed so serious with the stealth
[08:52.520 --> 08:57.400]  takeover the internet and free speech not just here but all the world that I'm
[08:57.400 --> 09:02.480]  being forced today to actually not do the radio show to legally do some
[09:02.480 --> 09:07.120]  research and contact a different legal counsel on so the actions that we need
[09:07.120 --> 09:11.880]  to take first let me give you some basic background you've heard many
[09:11.880 --> 09:16.680]  political analysts from Ron Paul to Max Kaiser to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts to
[09:16.680 --> 09:20.640]  Jesse Ventura to countless others say that I'm seen as a canary in the coal
[09:20.640 --> 09:25.400]  mine that if they ever come after info wars calm and prison planet calm
[09:25.400 --> 09:31.440]  overtly that everyone knows that that means it's the beginning of a major
[09:31.440 --> 09:37.200]  crackdown drudge report is also seen as the same and you notice that one of the
[09:37.200 --> 09:42.040]  FCC commissioners two days ago came out on Monday and said that there's
[09:42.040 --> 09:45.440]  discussions about going after drudge with the federal elections Commission
[09:45.440 --> 09:49.520]  same people that had deductions to put in prison for getting five of his
[09:49.520 --> 09:53.600]  friends to donate money to a Senate campaign the Clintons can have hundreds
[09:53.600 --> 09:57.280]  of millions and far any legal donations but you get a crooked toenail you're
[09:57.280 --> 10:02.520]  going to jail well they're claiming that all political speech is not first
[10:02.520 --> 10:07.360]  amendment that it's regulated underneath the federal elections Commission and
[10:07.360 --> 10:12.920]  they're saying that they are now in discussions again to shut down the
[10:12.920 --> 10:18.640]  drudge report when it comes to political speech now remember we have
[10:18.640 --> 10:23.320]  federal courts that rule Obamacare is constitutional we have federal courts
[10:23.320 --> 10:27.240]  starting to rule that they can forcibly inoculate you the courts have
[10:27.240 --> 10:33.080]  completely fallen to tyranny and from Australia to the United States forced
[10:33.080 --> 10:38.640]  inoculations are beginning and they're trying to ram through legislation so
[10:38.640 --> 10:43.040]  there's an overall atmosphere of tyranny we've seen the greatest oppression of
[10:43.040 --> 10:47.360]  American media and the press in history according to Jonathan Turley a top
[10:47.360 --> 10:53.360]  liberal constitutional law professor we've seen massive amounts of reporters
[10:53.360 --> 10:58.400]  indicted in prison for reporting on corruption we have seen the Tea Party
[10:58.400 --> 11:03.480]  gun owners Christian groups veterans groups audited harassed indicted arrested
[11:03.480 --> 11:08.880]  on political orders of the White House making Nixon's crimes look tame and no
[11:08.880 --> 11:13.040]  one gets in trouble we see a president operating as a dictator we're opening the
[11:13.040 --> 11:17.760]  border shutting down our power plants and having the FCC power grab the Internet
[11:17.760 --> 11:23.440]  we have the Trans-Pacific Partnership being rammed through right now in
[11:23.440 --> 11:28.600]  secret the only provision we have out of 30 plus was leaked a year ago by Wiki
[11:28.600 --> 11:33.440]  leaks and it deals with the Internet and it basically says corporations above
[11:33.440 --> 11:37.880]  government will have governing power to shut down anybody's website anybody's
[11:37.880 --> 11:42.560]  company or anyone's identity on the web with global Internet taxation and
[11:42.560 --> 11:47.440]  global Internet ID where they claim you've engaged in copyright violation
[11:47.440 --> 11:52.720]  they're the judge they're the jury in mega city like Judge Dredd and you're
[11:52.720 --> 11:57.800]  shut off kill switches are in all the devices the phones the the the smart
[11:57.800 --> 12:01.640]  refrigerators the washers the dryers the government admits the license plate
[12:01.640 --> 12:04.960]  readers are tracking everywhere you go and stingray systems are stealing your
[12:04.960 --> 12:11.600]  cell phone data all of this is happening and now in the last month outside third
[12:11.600 --> 12:15.560]  parties on our YouTube channel have almost taken it down three times we have
[12:15.560 --> 12:20.800]  had Facebook suspend us on one of all on all of our accounts that are over 3
[12:20.800 --> 12:26.240]  million people the largest one 800,000 that was just today it shut down right
[12:26.240 --> 12:32.960]  now we can't post to it or use it right now all of this is intensifying Alexa
[12:32.960 --> 12:40.480]  has delisted us drudge Fox News anybody not seen as pro Obama October 1st when
[12:40.480 --> 12:44.360]  it launched it's now completely clear from last year that October 1st is the
[12:44.360 --> 12:50.240]  nexus point we have those graphs so what they do is they incrementally attack you
[12:50.240 --> 12:53.080]  so that you don't realize what's happening so I don't realize what's
[12:53.080 --> 12:57.920]  happening as it intensifies but all of this is happening now Congress can't
[12:57.920 --> 13:03.520]  even see the Transpacific Partnership and but Boehner and Obama say you don't
[13:03.520 --> 13:07.120]  need to see it you need to just support it and Hillary's but acting like she's
[13:07.120 --> 13:10.360]  against it for the grassroots when she of course is one of the main people
[13:10.360 --> 13:15.400]  behind it so we have been overtaken in a new level of power grabbing is
[13:15.400 --> 13:19.440]  happening with Zuckerberg two months ago met with the Chinese Communist
[13:19.440 --> 13:24.080]  Sensors we've seen massive intensification of censorship there we're
[13:24.080 --> 13:29.160]  seeing just all sorts of dirty tricks behind the scenes they legalized
[13:29.160 --> 13:33.760]  domestic propaganda last year with the Pentagon that's what you see with Jade
[13:33.760 --> 13:37.840]  Helms seeing an attack does not want for twice last night David not a play one
[13:37.840 --> 13:42.120]  of those clips cut what I said down to three seconds where it sounds like I'm
[13:42.120 --> 13:46.320]  saying they're going to invade Texas when in the full video I say this is part
[13:46.320 --> 13:50.560]  of preparations down the road for federalization of police and law
[13:50.560 --> 13:56.840]  enforcement and state houses as the White House operative Al Sharpton said two
[13:56.840 --> 14:02.880]  days ago so it's on the rise the dirty tricks the deception the censorship the
[14:02.880 --> 14:08.640]  audits the harassment the tyranny a iron curtain of oppression is now
[14:08.640 --> 14:15.160]  descending down over this constitutional Republic and I need everyone out there
[14:15.160 --> 14:19.720]  to realize that if they can take down drudge and if they can take down info
[14:19.720 --> 14:24.240]  wars and if they can say that we don't have political speech and if Facebook
[14:24.240 --> 14:30.560]  can ban us because we put up a image with no blood no gore of an ISIS fighter
[14:30.560 --> 14:36.880]  and had a quote about terrorism on it as a alternative or mainline news entity
[14:36.880 --> 14:41.560]  were a private citizen you should be able to post that they let ISIS operate on
[14:41.560 --> 14:44.800]  there but they use that to shut us down the last time they did this is because
[14:44.800 --> 14:51.160]  we were posting memes by a Navy SEAL group exposing Benghazi that just said
[14:51.160 --> 14:55.800]  that Hillary stood down and let our people die no blood no gore no nothing
[14:55.800 --> 14:59.920]  censoring us well now they're saying they may just completely suspend our
[14:59.920 --> 15:04.880]  account for good and that means all of the three million people that get our
[15:04.880 --> 15:08.440]  information every day over Facebook and people say well Facebook owns its own
[15:08.440 --> 15:11.880]  thing don't use it listen it's been given media promotion it's been given
[15:11.880 --> 15:15.520]  dominance on the market it was allowed to do any legal pump and dump with its
[15:15.520 --> 15:20.320]  stock he's been to Bilderberg they are the advertisers and open comments our
[15:20.320 --> 15:26.240]  content gives them value then they selectively don't let us operate but
[15:26.240 --> 15:30.640]  let the White House and media matters and CNN MSNBC and the Young Turks
[15:30.640 --> 15:37.240]  operate that's an unfair playing field that is torturous interference it is
[15:37.240 --> 15:42.440]  true discrimination and as our credibility rises you're going to see
[15:42.440 --> 15:46.000]  the system more and more come in and try to shut down free speech so here's the
[15:46.000 --> 15:50.160]  bottom line the canary is being strangled right now in the coal mine the
[15:50.160 --> 15:55.400]  gas is in the mine we are the Paul Revere's warning people and if they can
[15:55.400 --> 15:59.600]  shut us down they can take everybody down the plan is implode the world
[15:59.600 --> 16:05.240]  currencies nationalize the private and public pension funds tax some regulate
[16:05.240 --> 16:09.720]  them raise taxes by executive order they're now blaming the people up in
[16:09.720 --> 16:14.640]  garland by Dallas they've got shot at by the jihadis saying it's their fault
[16:14.640 --> 16:18.320]  menus the free speech be restricted because it causes violence you see
[16:18.320 --> 16:24.000]  where this is all going they're coming after everybody but up front is drug
[16:24.000 --> 16:31.080]  report.com and info wars.com if they can get away with harassing us and shutting
[16:31.080 --> 16:36.240]  us down lying about us manipulating doing all this and curtailing it will be
[16:36.240 --> 16:42.440]  everybody else as well in fact that's already started the system years of
[16:42.440 --> 16:46.720]  foreign corporate takeover we have been hijacked we're going under TPP right
[16:46.720 --> 16:51.920]  now merging with the NAU and the EU it is the trilateralist plan and I hope
[16:51.920 --> 16:56.160]  coming up that I never got to a yesterday that David Knight will read the
[16:56.160 --> 17:01.280]  quotes by Barry Goldwater on this summer Goldwater it's here everything we talked
[17:01.280 --> 17:07.080]  about we're now coming in to the final major phase of agenda 21 of Cloward
[17:07.080 --> 17:13.160]  Piven of the total implosion of our society but the good news is historically
[17:13.160 --> 17:17.440]  this can backfire you the people have the real power you truly are the
[17:17.440 --> 17:21.880]  resistance and if you see this for what it is and tell your friends your family
[17:21.880 --> 17:26.640]  your neighbors info wars.com is under attack listen to this local AMR FM
[17:26.640 --> 17:30.360]  affiliate this is one of the shows on or have you become a sponsor of a local
[17:30.360 --> 17:33.920]  affiliate or have you support those sponsors and tell them why more
[17:33.920 --> 17:37.720]  stations will pick us up as they're doing so we're being attacked because
[17:37.720 --> 17:41.240]  we're growing we're being attacked because we're able to set the news
[17:41.240 --> 17:46.640]  agenda we're under attack because we're able to break out and get real stories
[17:46.640 --> 17:51.640]  out there and the dinosaur media is so weak now they were arrogant before now
[17:51.640 --> 17:55.240]  they realize they're on their last legs they're dying and so they're coming in
[17:55.240 --> 17:59.440]  right now trying to shut down free speech and overturn the chessboard because
[17:59.440 --> 18:04.120]  they can't win with their tyranny fair and square up against liberty so use
[18:04.120 --> 18:09.440]  Facebook use Twitter use YouTube use Pinterest use Craigslist use every
[18:09.440 --> 18:14.320]  internet system there is out there but also go low-tech write info wars.com
[18:14.320 --> 18:22.720]  on things that are passed back and forth to people in legal and lawful areas to
[18:22.720 --> 18:28.200]  post it on cards put it in the in letters to the editor calling to talk
[18:28.200 --> 18:34.000]  radio talk about it get aggressive and let them see a major flood response back
[18:34.000 --> 18:39.160]  in their face for what they're doing because they've legalized propaganda
[18:39.160 --> 18:43.520]  domestically they're putting out lies they're coming after everybody this is
[18:43.520 --> 18:48.640]  so incredibly serious and on a Richter scale used to censorship dirty tricks
[18:48.640 --> 18:52.160]  were two or three now they're like a seven array and we can see them ramping
[18:52.160 --> 18:58.440]  straight up into the stratosphere I also shot a video today on the road but
[18:58.440 --> 19:03.280]  it was unable to upload it we're able to get it up later in the broadcast I do
[19:03.280 --> 19:07.880]  want that 10-minute emergency alert aired and I need all of you when it goes on
[19:07.880 --> 19:12.040]  info wars.com and prisonpana.com to send that on to people because here's the
[19:12.040 --> 19:15.960]  bottom line there is a stealth internet free speech takeover that's
[19:15.960 --> 19:19.760]  accelerating and it's not even really stealth but it's stealth the public
[19:19.760 --> 19:23.840]  don't pay attention that FCC's grabbed the web they're coming in saying they're
[19:23.840 --> 19:26.920]  gonna apply election rules to the web they're saying what's being discussed is
[19:26.920 --> 19:31.600]  going after drudge that means everybody it's here we're barely able to stay on

[19:46.080 --> 19:54.200]  nexonian administration on LSD and steroids they mean business it's here so
[19:54.200 --> 19:59.120]  you need to support the info war or lose it the globalist are moving into their
[19:59.120 --> 20:02.040]  next phase and they could not have that position. Silver is only the nature's very own

[20:42.040 --> 20:44.720]  issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the

[24:15.400 --> 24:21.960]  I'm gonna do about Facebook about Alexa about companies online manipulating
[24:21.960 --> 24:27.200]  stuff that's going on I know according to current law stuff that's going on it
[24:27.200 --> 24:34.240]  gonna fly in court and again the the level of intensification of tyranny is
[24:34.240 --> 24:40.200]  off the chart I want to explain something the TPP being negotiated in
[24:40.200 --> 24:44.520]  secret I can't believe I'm saying that the Congress can't even see the one
[24:44.520 --> 24:47.640]  section we got and David I'll talk about this coming up as I know he's an
[24:47.640 --> 24:54.000]  expert on it is worse than Sopa and Sysma and so they're basically already
[24:54.000 --> 24:58.480]  operating like Sopa and Sysma are in place and that's what EFF another
[24:58.480 --> 25:02.000]  foundation said is that these corporations will just claim you violate
[25:02.000 --> 25:07.080]  in terms of use because they're so wide open they can discriminate against you
[25:07.080 --> 25:10.760]  it's the same thing of like saying you won't sell a house to a black person or
[25:10.760 --> 25:16.440]  something well folks know that that's an unfair trade practice and so there's
[25:16.440 --> 25:19.760]  laws on the books but what about if you're a conservative or a libertarian
[25:19.760 --> 25:24.360]  and then people advertise a Craigslist or a Facebook or a Twitter and they say
[25:24.360 --> 25:29.000]  sorry you can't be on there already all over the country they're saying on
[25:29.000 --> 25:33.280]  Craigslist or on other platforms or on newspapers you can't have a sporting
[25:33.280 --> 25:37.600]  good shop advertised that sells guns and now banks are saying to establish
[25:37.600 --> 25:41.280]  sporting good stores remember it came out last year they were doing to Cabela's
[25:41.280 --> 25:47.960]  and others oh you can't be with Bank of America anymore because you sell guns
[25:47.960 --> 25:52.840]  this is happening and this is what the Nazis did was first turn off the
[25:52.840 --> 25:58.040]  economic system of their enemies first they don't want us to build our own
[25:58.040 --> 26:03.840]  media system as the Clinton library papers came out last year showed they
[26:03.840 --> 26:07.800]  said label is conspiracy theory shut down new media we can't allow this to start
[26:07.800 --> 26:11.320]  growing and let people think on their own these are White House memos well
[26:11.320 --> 26:15.120]  guess what we did get on the web the Western Journalism Center in world that
[26:15.120 --> 26:19.840]  daily did get there drudge did get there info wars got there and now we're
[26:19.840 --> 26:24.680]  there and the question is will the people value this information or will you
[26:24.680 --> 26:28.800]  let them shut down talk radio which they're openly talking about doing with
[26:28.800 --> 26:32.760]  the fairness doctrine bringing it back under a new name will you let them come
[26:32.760 --> 26:36.520]  in and federalize the police will you let them come in and shut down our
[26:36.520 --> 26:41.040]  industry will you let them put us under these new treaties it's up to you the
[26:41.040 --> 26:45.920]  answer is use it while we've still got it to make it so big and so strong they
[26:45.920 --> 26:50.800]  can't shut it down let them see that you respond to this let them see that it
[26:50.800 --> 26:59.440]  upset you that in coordinated action across the board from Facebook to Alexa
[26:59.440 --> 27:06.640]  we're seeing intensified censorship and open calls at the FCC to censor
[27:06.640 --> 27:10.600]  political speech claiming that it's all basically a form of money and so that
[27:10.600 --> 27:14.600]  when I say I'm against Bloomberg or I'm against somebody that I'm basically
[27:14.600 --> 27:19.040]  that's political speech that counts as money and so I only have $4,000 of
[27:19.040 --> 27:23.080]  speech a year which I would use up in five seconds that's basically the
[27:23.080 --> 27:28.000]  metrics they have but Bloomberg can get hundreds of millions of dollars to local
[27:28.000 --> 27:33.480]  candidates to take your guns he's left alone so so understand this is here and
[27:33.480 --> 27:36.560]  don't say it won't happen yeah just like torture wouldn't happen or open
[27:36.560 --> 27:41.120]  borders wouldn't happen or Obamacare wouldn't happen it's all happening the
[27:41.120 --> 27:45.040]  good news is people are upset they're awake they know what's going on they
[27:45.040 --> 27:47.800]  know about militarization of police they know about the military training to take
[27:47.800 --> 27:52.600]  guns they know about Katrina they know about the it's out there and so the
[27:52.600 --> 27:58.880]  battle is joined the battle is now spread the word at the end of every email
[27:58.880 --> 28:02.320]  you send have a link to info wars.com forward slash show would say this is
[28:02.320 --> 28:05.520]  forbidden information free audio video feeds to find out about what's really
[28:05.520 --> 28:09.600]  happening put that on Facebook right now put that on Twitter right now we're
[28:09.600 --> 28:13.680]  gonna put an article out about this get it out to everybody you know and let the
[28:13.680 --> 28:18.160]  system know they may try to suppress us spreading freedom it's popular on these
[28:18.160 --> 28:22.320]  globalist platforms but we're gonna do it at info wars.com and prison planet
[28:22.320 --> 28:27.280]  dot com but they're coming after those as well with sensors and with hackers
[28:27.280 --> 28:31.680]  black cat hackers again with the establishment and with everything else
[28:31.680 --> 28:34.920]  they're coming after it that's why I've got a whole bunch of different websites
[28:34.920 --> 28:38.360]  so they can't take them all down as easy so we'll still have an ace in the hole
[28:38.360 --> 28:43.920]  we're designed and built to take attacks but I'm telling you as a sensor as a
[28:43.920 --> 28:50.000]  bellwether as a weather vane we are here telling you the storm is here as you
[28:50.000 --> 28:53.360]  already know we don't know what it's going to be global war dollar
[28:53.360 --> 28:58.560]  devaluation soft martial law race riots this summer the point is they're
[28:58.560 --> 29:02.640]  intensifying the crises everywhere and out of that they want to bring in the
[29:02.640 --> 29:07.280]  planetary regime out of that they want to bring in the planetary tyranny the
[29:07.280 --> 29:11.160]  most important thing to do is to also spread the word and financially support

[30:21.280 --> 30:25.360]  scientific report titled why children absorb more microwave radiation than
[30:25.360 --> 30:30.240]  adults argued that children in fetuses absorb more microwave radiation because
[30:30.240 --> 30:34.320]  their bodies are relatively smaller their skulls are thinner and their brain
[30:34.320 --> 30:38.120]  tissue is more absorbent another study published by the British Medical
[30:38.120 --> 30:42.800]  Journal determined that exposure to cell phone towers alters brain function in

[31:03.360 --> 31:08.040]  that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true

[33:32.440 --> 33:34.600]  outside of the studio
[33:34.600 --> 33:38.200]  as he pointed out he's looking for ways that we can respond to the recent
[33:38.200 --> 33:40.080]  attacks on info wars of course
[33:40.080 --> 33:43.160]  uh... we had a report yesterday alex went over that in great detail there's an
[33:43.160 --> 33:46.240]  article by paul joseph what's about how our metrics are being
[33:46.240 --> 33:48.320]  uh... manipulate not only just ours but
[33:48.320 --> 33:51.920]  uh... the conservative press the libertarian presses metrics are being
[33:51.920 --> 33:53.840]  manipulated by alexa
[33:53.840 --> 33:55.000]  owned by
[33:55.000 --> 33:55.800]  amazon
[33:55.800 --> 33:59.600]  which does significant business with the government and of course uh...
[33:59.600 --> 34:02.320]  jeff bezos who owns amazon is a very interested
[34:02.320 --> 34:05.520]  in politics uh... he paid two hundred fifty million dollars for the
[34:05.520 --> 34:09.360]  washington post that that shows you how interested in politics he is not his
[34:09.360 --> 34:10.680]  core business
[34:10.680 --> 34:14.080]  unless you're looking to get permission for doing drone delivery or anything
[34:14.080 --> 34:16.720]  else that you want you want that green lighted it's very helpful
[34:16.720 --> 34:18.520]  to have
[34:18.520 --> 34:21.360]  biggest paper one of the biggest papers in the country but certainly the biggest
[34:21.360 --> 34:23.680]  paper in washington
[34:23.680 --> 34:26.720]  today we had a story and we talked about this and we've got a special report
[34:26.720 --> 34:30.960]  coming up from alex the bottom of the next hour about face book uh... blocking
[34:30.960 --> 34:33.880]  us for a very benign picture
[34:33.880 --> 34:37.840]  and you can see that picture if you go to our website we also uh... tweeted the
[34:37.840 --> 34:39.080]  picture out
[34:39.080 --> 34:40.200]  uh... i'm
[34:40.200 --> 34:44.200]  informed by kit daniels came and said that they have found a workaround for
[34:44.200 --> 34:47.680]  being able to post by using a different admin account
[34:47.680 --> 34:51.400]  uh... so that's something as a warning for any of you people who are doing
[34:51.400 --> 34:53.440]  things that you think you might get that censored
[34:53.440 --> 34:56.720]  uh... on face book uh... for and and who knows we would never thought this would
[34:56.720 --> 34:59.160]  be something that would censor us but as you can see in the article
[34:59.160 --> 35:00.800]  because screenshot of when they
[35:00.800 --> 35:04.480]  blocked us from posting for three days for that admin account and you can see
[35:04.480 --> 35:07.040]  what the picture is all describe it for the people who are listening on the
[35:07.040 --> 35:08.240]  radio
[35:08.240 --> 35:12.440]  basically in the foreground we have a quote from joseph stalin
[35:12.440 --> 35:15.920]  then there's a man there that is wearing like a ski mask over his head i
[35:15.920 --> 35:19.120]  forget what they call this specific term for those types of masks
[35:19.120 --> 35:22.240]  uh... and he's wearing camo and behind a lot of
[35:22.240 --> 35:23.640]  balaclava yes thank you
[35:23.640 --> 35:24.800]  story about a lot of
[35:24.800 --> 35:26.320]  he's wearing camo
[35:26.320 --> 35:27.760]  you don't see any gun
[35:27.760 --> 35:28.960]  you don't see any knife
[35:28.960 --> 35:30.360]  you don't see any blood
[35:30.360 --> 35:33.840]  there's nothing that is violent whatsoever about it he's just standing and
[35:33.840 --> 35:36.280]  looking with a flag in the background
[35:36.280 --> 35:37.720]  now that was enough
[35:37.720 --> 35:38.760]  for them to
[35:38.760 --> 35:41.600]  band the account from posting for three days
[35:41.600 --> 35:42.560]  and here's the quote
[35:42.560 --> 35:46.280]  the easiest way to gain control of a population is to carry out acts of terror
[35:46.280 --> 35:47.760]  joseph stalin
[35:47.760 --> 35:49.760]  or as i point out the beginning of the hour
[35:49.760 --> 35:51.560]  maybe an even easier way
[35:51.560 --> 35:56.360]  is to put in corporate censorship because that's what we're going to get
[35:56.360 --> 35:59.080]  with the trans-pacific partnership that is coming through
[35:59.080 --> 36:01.000]  it is about far more than free trade
[36:01.000 --> 36:04.600]  if it was simply about economics it would be bad enough
[36:04.600 --> 36:07.640]  and we can talk about that and we will talk about that later in the program if
[36:07.640 --> 36:09.880]  we look at what's happened with trade deficits
[36:09.880 --> 36:13.920]  uh... there's been a lot of opposition within the democrats there has been no
[36:13.920 --> 36:15.040]  opposition
[36:15.040 --> 36:17.560]  within the republicans i'm sad to say
[36:17.560 --> 36:19.480]  not even from the people who are running
[36:19.480 --> 36:21.480]  uh... for president people who should know better
[36:21.480 --> 36:23.640]  ted cruise ran paul people who
[36:23.640 --> 36:26.960]  typically will stand up for uh... the constitution there
[36:26.960 --> 36:28.960]  very silent or they are supportive
[36:28.960 --> 36:31.800]  it appears that ran paul is going to support this it look like he's going to
[36:31.800 --> 36:32.640]  support it
[36:32.640 --> 36:35.960]  right after the election he started talking about free trade
[36:35.960 --> 36:38.800]  very disturbing if he does he should know better
[36:38.800 --> 36:41.240]  as uh... alex jones pointed out
[36:41.240 --> 36:45.400]  even very goldwater knew how this is going to break down decades ago here's a
[36:45.400 --> 36:48.040]  quote from very goldwater he said let's let's read this quote and let's go
[36:48.040 --> 36:49.680]  through this quote the trilateral
[36:49.680 --> 36:51.520]  trilateralist commission
[36:51.520 --> 36:53.520]  is international says very goldwater
[36:53.520 --> 36:57.640]  and is intended to be the vehicle for multinational consolidation
[36:57.640 --> 36:59.920]  of the commercial and banking interests
[36:59.920 --> 37:04.040]  by seizing control of the political government of the united states see
[37:04.040 --> 37:05.320]  it's not a trade agreement
[37:05.320 --> 37:08.280]  it is a sovereignty agreement there's politics involved in it
[37:08.280 --> 37:11.240]  and very goldwater goes on to say the trilateralist commission
[37:11.240 --> 37:13.960]  represents a skillful coordinated effort
[37:13.960 --> 37:15.320]  to seize control
[37:15.320 --> 37:18.680]  and consolidate the four centers of power
[37:18.680 --> 37:20.200]  pilot political
[37:20.200 --> 37:21.360]  monetary
[37:21.360 --> 37:22.280]  intellectual
[37:22.280 --> 37:24.880]  and ecclesiastical
[37:24.880 --> 37:27.600]  so certainly you can understand the political and monetary we look at the
[37:27.600 --> 37:32.040]  intellectual and the ecclesiastical i would say that the way that that shows up
[37:32.040 --> 37:33.200]  is in the
[37:33.200 --> 37:35.480]  political correctness we have that seeks to
[37:35.480 --> 37:36.640]  censor people
[37:36.640 --> 37:37.760]  to destroy
[37:37.760 --> 37:38.720]  both
[37:38.720 --> 37:42.680]  uh... sections of the first amendment both free speech and freedom of religion and
[37:42.680 --> 37:44.280]  certainly we have seen that
[37:44.280 --> 37:47.120]  and understand that the trilateralist commission
[37:47.120 --> 37:48.360]  was
[37:48.360 --> 37:52.880]  set up to you for the same trading blocks that we currently now see
[37:52.880 --> 37:54.280]  courses north america
[37:54.280 --> 37:55.560]  and we've had uh...
[37:55.560 --> 37:58.680]  uh... general portray say that of course what comes after america remember that
[37:58.680 --> 37:59.840]  about a year ago
[37:59.840 --> 38:02.600]  is that what comes after america that's easy north america were twenty years
[38:02.600 --> 38:05.800]  into nafta said general portrays
[38:05.800 --> 38:08.880]  we understand that is a consolidation
[38:08.880 --> 38:11.960]  and of course we have seen that the uh...
[38:11.960 --> 38:14.800]  uh... the different groups the council on foreign relations
[38:14.800 --> 38:18.040]  for example and there's all these groups the trilateralist commission the
[38:18.040 --> 38:19.720]  council on foreign relations
[38:19.720 --> 38:22.080]  all of these different groups
[38:22.080 --> 38:24.120]  pretty much interlocking directories
[38:24.120 --> 38:27.440]  there's so many of these groups these guys can basically go to whatever
[38:27.440 --> 38:30.720]  meeting they choose to go to whether it's a belterberg group or whether it's the
[38:30.720 --> 38:31.880]  uh... cfr
[38:31.880 --> 38:34.240]  uh... meeting on a particular topic
[38:34.240 --> 38:37.680]  and they can catch each other up on what's going on
[38:37.680 --> 38:39.120]  and we understand
[38:39.120 --> 38:42.880]  that this is a globalist agenda that they are creating in the name of free
[38:42.880 --> 38:45.440]  trade in the name of trading blocks they're creating
[38:45.440 --> 38:46.520]  different areas
[38:46.520 --> 38:49.800]  and i started talking about the council on foreign relations that was a uh...
[38:49.800 --> 38:53.800]  uh... a special report that they did about ten years ago
[38:53.800 --> 38:57.040]  involved ed cruz's wife and they were talking about
[38:57.040 --> 38:57.960]  they should
[38:57.960 --> 39:01.440]  make one border that went around the perimeter of the three nations that
[39:01.440 --> 39:05.440]  ran nafta mexico the united states in canada
[39:05.440 --> 39:07.800]  physical border that would be patrolled by
[39:07.800 --> 39:09.040]  our police state
[39:09.040 --> 39:12.240]  by the u.s. police state because you know we are the policeman of the world
[39:12.240 --> 39:15.640]  and uh... that's how they're going to use it to make you safer they're going to
[39:15.640 --> 39:16.640]  create a
[39:16.640 --> 39:20.680]  uh... jail essentially for you uh... seal you and
[39:20.680 --> 39:24.720]  but of course we also see that in europe now especially with the problems with
[39:24.720 --> 39:27.240]  grease we've had uh...
[39:27.240 --> 39:31.040]  alan greenspan as well as the head of the largest bond fund in the world pimko
[39:31.040 --> 39:32.200]  both say
[39:32.200 --> 39:36.480]  that grease will probably leave that the e you will break up unless the state's
[39:36.480 --> 39:39.800]  seed sovereignty to the e you
[39:39.800 --> 39:43.240]  so that is the direction that this is all headed that's why uh... they're
[39:43.240 --> 39:47.360]  putting these trade agreements together that's why we should be very concerned
[39:47.360 --> 39:49.760]  just the secret nature of the trade agreement
[39:49.760 --> 39:53.200]  ought to be enough to stop it
[39:53.200 --> 39:56.280]  i want to go to that right now before i go into any more this free speech if i
[39:56.280 --> 39:59.520]  have a lot of information about free speech because that's been on the news
[39:59.520 --> 40:01.000]  this week but
[40:01.000 --> 40:05.080]  just understand that mitch mcconnell is fully on board with president obama
[40:05.080 --> 40:08.640]  listen to the wonderful things that he has to say about obama when it comes to
[40:08.640 --> 40:10.960]  this trade project he said
[40:10.960 --> 40:15.000]  it's been almost an out-of-body experiences mitch mcconnell
[40:15.000 --> 40:19.000]  but we've been working closely with the white house we're working together
[40:19.000 --> 40:23.080]  to get this across the finish line at the risk of having some of you literally
[40:23.080 --> 40:27.720]  faint i want to compliment president obama for the way he is handling the trade
[40:27.720 --> 40:32.360]  issue says republican senate leader mitch mcconnell you understand
[40:32.360 --> 40:36.440]  they're just two sides
[40:36.440 --> 40:39.080]  same puppet controlling both of them and of course we see a lot of
[40:39.080 --> 40:41.680]  democrats who are caving in on this as well
[40:41.680 --> 40:44.320]  they report that a number of democrats are saying they're willing to vote for
[40:44.320 --> 40:45.600]  the legislation
[40:45.600 --> 40:49.160]  just over the past few days now there's sixteen who have publicly said that they
[40:49.160 --> 40:50.240]  will support it
[40:50.240 --> 40:54.680]  uh... the latest two are a democrat representatives amy bearer of california
[40:54.680 --> 40:59.040]  and john delaney of maryland have both said that they will vote yes and a
[40:59.040 --> 41:00.720]  representative from or again
[41:00.720 --> 41:04.000]  is also coming out in favor of it so
[41:04.000 --> 41:07.480]  you need to get on the phone with your democrat or republican you need to hold
[41:07.480 --> 41:11.800]  these people's feet to the fire because we should never have a situation
[41:11.800 --> 41:15.520]  where we have a trade agreement that our senators are not allowed to see they're
[41:15.520 --> 41:18.480]  not allowed to talk about this is the story that was up on drudge report
[41:18.480 --> 41:23.000]  yesterday on politico extreme secrecy is eroding support for obama's trade pack
[41:23.000 --> 41:26.880]  except that what's happening is that political partisan pressure by
[41:26.880 --> 41:29.720]  democrat leaders who were into this every bit
[41:29.720 --> 41:32.880]  as much as the republican leadership
[41:32.880 --> 41:35.960]  they are turning the uh... democrat members
[41:35.960 --> 41:40.000]  towards voting for this now listen to what happens if you try to go in here
[41:40.000 --> 41:42.960]  and look at this uh... trade agreement
[41:42.960 --> 41:44.840]  they say if you want to read the details
[41:44.840 --> 41:48.360]  you have to go to a classified briefing you have to leave your staff you have to
[41:48.360 --> 41:50.320]  leave your cell phone at the door
[41:50.320 --> 41:51.920]  can't take any pictures
[41:51.920 --> 41:53.840]  if you're a member of congress
[41:53.840 --> 41:57.080]  who wants to read the text you've got to go into a room
[41:57.080 --> 42:01.600]  in the basement of the capital visitor center you'll be handed it one section
[42:01.600 --> 42:04.640]  at a time and of course there's many different sections
[42:04.640 --> 42:08.600]  their sections about open borders their sections about copyright their sections
[42:08.600 --> 42:12.840]  about the internet this is not simply a trade agreement that's one of the reasons
[42:12.840 --> 42:16.640]  why the democrats are going to fail is because they're not focusing on the
[42:16.640 --> 42:20.280]  broad scope of this there's so many different aspects and of course
[42:20.280 --> 42:24.480]  i don't expect them to talk about the bigger picture of regional consolidation
[42:24.480 --> 42:26.320]  being a stepping stone to
[42:26.320 --> 42:28.480]  a world one world government
[42:28.480 --> 42:32.120]  being run by multinational corporations course they will talk about how the
[42:32.120 --> 42:36.400]  corporations are going to be elevated to the level of nation states or higher
[42:36.400 --> 42:39.120]  but they won't draw that conclusion nevertheless this is what you have to do
[42:39.120 --> 42:42.320]  you have to get rid of all the stuff in your hand at one section at a time
[42:42.320 --> 42:44.560]  they watch you if you're a congressman
[42:44.560 --> 42:46.560]  as you read the bill
[42:46.560 --> 42:53.000]  and they force you to hand over any notes that you've made before you leave
[42:53.000 --> 42:54.400]  when you look at this
[42:54.400 --> 42:56.960]  ask yourself
[42:56.960 --> 42:58.000]  is the real
[42:58.000 --> 42:59.520]  government here
[42:59.520 --> 43:01.720]  is that our congressman who are
[43:01.720 --> 43:05.360]  uh... watched like school children
[43:05.360 --> 43:08.280]  they're giving them one section at a time you can't take anything in you can't take
[43:08.280 --> 43:12.760]  any notes out with you gotta leave your cell phone you gotta leave your staff
[43:12.760 --> 43:16.720]  are those leaders are those people with any real power
[43:16.720 --> 43:18.080]  i don't think so
[43:18.080 --> 43:20.520]  i think the real people with power
[43:20.520 --> 43:24.160]  are the corporate lobbyist and the corporations that they work for who are
[43:24.160 --> 43:27.480]  making these rules for our congressman
[43:27.480 --> 43:30.560]  you understand now how the facade has come off
[43:30.560 --> 43:33.920]  of this fascist corporate state
[43:33.920 --> 43:35.760]  just read this
[43:35.760 --> 43:40.480]  this politico article and you understand who has the power who has the control
[43:40.480 --> 43:43.760]  and they're going to consolidate it to the point where they own and control
[43:43.760 --> 43:45.080]  everything
[43:45.080 --> 43:48.400]  now we've been talking about how
[43:48.400 --> 43:50.880]  facebook can just
[43:50.880 --> 43:55.400]  shut down our postings because of an innocuous picture they claim
[43:55.400 --> 43:57.160]  i think there's more to it than that
[43:57.160 --> 44:00.080]  alex thinks there's more to it than that as well i mean look at that picture
[44:00.080 --> 44:04.440]  there's no way that they could justify under the most politically correct
[44:04.440 --> 44:08.440]  agenda you can imagine that that would be offensive to anyone there's no
[44:08.440 --> 44:11.760]  offense about that it is purely directed at us
[44:11.760 --> 44:13.960]  and let me tell you how this is going to work
[44:13.960 --> 44:15.080]  they have tried this
[44:15.080 --> 44:17.480]  with soba acta pipa syspa
[44:17.480 --> 44:21.120]  one syspa two now they're coming back with sysa they took the p out although
[44:21.120 --> 44:24.640]  the protection is still in and the protection is not to protect you
[44:24.640 --> 44:28.360]  the protection is there for the corporations to protect them from
[44:28.360 --> 44:32.040]  turning over third party to protect them from civil liability when they turn
[44:32.040 --> 44:33.560]  over your data
[44:33.560 --> 44:36.120]  that they call third party data
[44:36.120 --> 44:39.920]  they also want through these copyright uh... assertions
[44:39.920 --> 44:43.400]  okay it works for the corporate state because they want to own everything
[44:43.400 --> 44:46.680]  i mean we talked about this before how john deere and general motors
[44:46.680 --> 44:48.680]  are saying openly now
[44:48.680 --> 44:52.360]  because of the digital millennium copyright act they say that you don't
[44:52.360 --> 44:54.120]  uh... you don't own your car
[44:54.120 --> 44:57.000]  you have an implied license to use that car because
[44:57.000 --> 44:59.320]  the software is now what's controlling that car
[44:59.320 --> 45:02.480]  you're not allowed to work on your own car because you are your
[45:02.480 --> 45:05.960]  john deere tractor because you would be working with their software
[45:05.960 --> 45:10.120]  see they want you to be a surf a slave
[45:10.120 --> 45:12.280]  sharecropper if you will
[45:12.280 --> 45:15.640]  who doesn't own a single thing and that's what's behind
[45:15.640 --> 45:18.440]  a lot of this trans-specific partnership what's going on with the
[45:18.440 --> 45:20.600]  copyright stuff
[45:20.600 --> 45:23.840]  but the way that they're going to censor the internet is also through the
[45:23.840 --> 45:25.000]  copyright stuff so
[45:25.000 --> 45:26.200]  it works either
[45:26.200 --> 45:29.080]  the government and the corporations both get something out of it the
[45:29.080 --> 45:34.480]  corporations get to own everything and the government gets to control everything
[45:34.480 --> 45:37.920]  so they'll take a look at your website and if they don't like you
[45:37.920 --> 45:42.000]  they'll make some bogus claim about copyright infringement just like
[45:42.000 --> 45:46.400]  facebook just made a bogus claim about something being offensive
[45:46.400 --> 45:48.520]  and then they will shut you down
[45:48.520 --> 45:51.160]  without any due process without any delay they will just
[45:51.160 --> 45:53.960]  flip the switch and your website goes down
[45:53.960 --> 45:56.800]  you see we've put up with civil asset forfeiture
[45:56.800 --> 46:00.600]  in the name of the war on drugs where the police can just pull you over because
[46:00.600 --> 46:03.240]  they don't like the way you looked at them or because they think that you look
[46:03.240 --> 46:06.880]  like somebody they might be able to shake down and steal something from
[46:06.880 --> 46:08.000]  and then they just
[46:08.000 --> 46:08.920]  take it
[46:08.920 --> 46:10.120]  they charge your
[46:10.120 --> 46:11.000]  cash
[46:11.000 --> 46:13.000]  with committing a crime
[46:13.000 --> 46:15.240]  they do it civilly so they say well
[46:15.240 --> 46:17.040]  it's a civil matter so
[46:17.040 --> 46:19.480]  the constitution doesn't apply
[46:19.480 --> 46:22.760]  so that's only for criminal charges we call this civil charges
[46:22.760 --> 46:26.680]  and by the way you know we don't have any constitutional rights for property so
[46:26.680 --> 46:30.720]  if the property is committing a crime we can seize the property
[46:30.720 --> 46:32.920]  that's the kind of legal fictions that they use
[46:32.920 --> 46:33.840]  but they can just
[46:33.840 --> 46:37.600]  without trial without due process they can just take your stuff
[46:37.600 --> 46:39.080]  wherever they want to
[46:39.080 --> 46:42.160]  that is the same thing you're going to see with the trans specific partnership
[46:42.160 --> 46:43.640]  you're going to see civil
[46:43.640 --> 46:45.680]  website forfeiture
[46:45.680 --> 46:47.840]  where they just take your website
[46:47.840 --> 46:51.160]  they do it as a civil action or they do it through a corporation the corporation says
[46:51.160 --> 46:51.640]  well
[46:51.640 --> 46:52.800]  you know you violated
[46:52.800 --> 46:56.560]  our rules of service or whatever you know that that
[46:56.560 --> 46:58.120]  fine print that you see all the time
[46:58.120 --> 47:01.120]  you violated our rules of service so we're just going to take it down
[47:01.120 --> 47:03.360]  and it just goes away
[47:03.360 --> 47:07.240]  now there are economic reasons to oppose a trans specific partnership
[47:07.240 --> 47:08.440]  alan grason
[47:08.440 --> 47:12.960]  a democrat who is opposing obama and the democrat leadership on this
[47:12.960 --> 47:14.720]  has pointed out that basically
[47:14.720 --> 47:18.080]  this has not worked very well for us with nafta
[47:18.080 --> 47:22.000]  he says it's not free trade it's fake trade
[47:22.000 --> 47:22.880]  it is
[47:22.880 --> 47:28.400]  crony capitalism it is the bank or bailout in advance this is exactly what
[47:28.400 --> 47:29.120]  this is
[47:29.120 --> 47:30.840]  laying the foundation for
[47:30.840 --> 47:33.840]  he says before nafta was enacted and went into effect this country never had a
[47:33.840 --> 47:37.920]  trade deficit as much as a hundred forty billion dollars a year
[47:37.920 --> 47:42.560]  however since then for twenty years we've never had a trade deficit less than
[47:42.560 --> 47:45.360]  a hundred and forty billion dollars a year
[47:45.360 --> 47:48.360]  i think it was clinton who uh... was selling it said we're going to have an
[47:48.360 --> 47:51.200]  immediate trade surplus of two hundred million dollars no
[47:51.200 --> 47:53.480]  uh... it's it's uh...
[47:53.480 --> 47:56.240]  i'm sorry it was two hundred thousand jobs is what he said we're going to get
[47:56.240 --> 47:58.800]  we've lost almost seven hundred thousand jobs
[47:58.800 --> 48:02.520]  uh... but nevertheless we had immediately the biggest trade deficit we
[48:02.520 --> 48:06.120]  ever had a hundred billion forty billion dollars and we've never had a
[48:06.120 --> 48:07.840]  smaller trade deficit than that
[48:07.840 --> 48:11.760]  he points out that we have had an average of half a billion dollars now
[48:11.760 --> 48:15.240]  for the last fourteen years a trade deficit
[48:15.240 --> 48:17.480]  it is increasing rapidly
[48:17.480 --> 48:22.040]  uh... we just had a one-month deficit of fifty one billion dollars
[48:22.040 --> 48:25.680]  which is a forty percent forty some odd percent increase over the previous
[48:25.680 --> 48:29.200]  month now the way they're selling this and they're telling us that
[48:29.200 --> 48:30.560]  it is so secret
[48:30.560 --> 48:33.840]  and we have to have a secret because you know national security
[48:33.840 --> 48:37.040]  that's always the excuse they use for the secret
[48:37.040 --> 48:38.800]  state we have a secret
[48:38.800 --> 48:42.400]  court the faiza court we have secret court decisions that are made by the
[48:42.400 --> 48:45.480]  faiza court that you're never allowed to see but they maintain
[48:45.480 --> 48:48.360]  that they alter the constitution
[48:48.360 --> 48:52.200]  we have a secret trade agreement that's being developed now and
[48:52.200 --> 48:56.000]  this article that's on info wars dot com ultra secrecy surrounds barack obama's
[48:56.000 --> 48:58.360]  new global economic treaty
[48:58.360 --> 49:02.600]  when they go through this when they try to justify this just as they did in
[49:02.600 --> 49:04.040]  politico they said well
[49:04.040 --> 49:06.200]  you know this is basically uh...
[49:06.200 --> 49:09.480]  a national security issue it may not seem like a national security issue but
[49:09.480 --> 49:11.800]  it is because you know
[49:11.800 --> 49:13.560]  china's involved
[49:13.560 --> 49:16.240]  this is a threat to our national security
[49:16.240 --> 49:18.080]  not true
[49:18.080 --> 49:21.520]  listen to the way that they have manipulated this story it's all broken
[49:21.520 --> 49:23.920]  down an article on the new american
[49:23.920 --> 49:27.200]  and this is a confession from a chinese diplomat they've tried to portray the
[49:27.200 --> 49:29.400]  tpp as the good trade agreement
[49:29.400 --> 49:31.640]  which is going to be an opposition to the
[49:31.640 --> 49:34.440]  bad trade agreement that china is putting together they call that the
[49:34.440 --> 49:36.200]  f t a a p
[49:36.200 --> 49:39.040]  i'm really getting sick and tired of these acronyms because i'm getting sick
[49:39.040 --> 49:40.480]  and tired of the government that creates them
[49:40.480 --> 49:43.760]  anyway what they say is there's been many videos in the u.s.
[49:43.760 --> 49:46.080]  that have been described that have described the tpp
[49:46.080 --> 49:47.320]  and the free trade
[49:47.320 --> 49:50.600]  area of the asian pacific that's the f t a a p
[49:50.600 --> 49:53.920]  as two competing trade initiatives
[49:53.920 --> 49:58.760]  and labeled the competition as a china u.s. tug-of-war in the asia pacific
[49:58.760 --> 50:00.560]  region so you see they
[50:00.560 --> 50:03.640]  they create this false dichotomy which they always do
[50:03.640 --> 50:08.440]  to scare us into doing what they wanted us to do all along
[50:08.440 --> 50:11.800]  the false dichotomy here their bifurcation is that we've got
[50:11.800 --> 50:15.680]  a bad trade agreement that's being created by china so we've got to create
[50:15.680 --> 50:16.440]  ours
[50:16.440 --> 50:19.120]  in opposition to them that's the tpp
[50:19.120 --> 50:22.240]  now they're not making that argument with the european agreement
[50:22.240 --> 50:23.600]  they're just doing it
[50:23.600 --> 50:24.360]  okay
[50:24.360 --> 50:27.640]  uh... but uh... that's what they're telling everybody and that's why they say
[50:27.640 --> 50:31.360]  it has to be secret because you know this is national security
[50:31.360 --> 50:35.400]  an absolute lie and listen to what a chinese diplomat said
[50:35.400 --> 50:38.640]  this is what a former council of the foreign ministry of china said
[50:38.640 --> 50:39.840]  he said uh...
[50:39.840 --> 50:40.960]  that although
[50:40.960 --> 50:46.040]  they appear to be rival the rivalry doesn't exist the hype is overblown
[50:46.040 --> 50:48.240]  and they are compatible with each other
[50:48.240 --> 50:51.320]  and it was pete sessions republican who pointed out
[50:51.320 --> 50:54.360]  they can add any nation they want and they can change the terms because it's
[50:54.360 --> 50:55.480]  a living document

[55:21.800 --> 55:27.200]  course david do Hearst worked with the tsa to shut this down he sabotaged this
[55:27.200 --> 55:33.200]  after it passed unanimously in the texas house he shut it down in the senate at
[55:33.200 --> 55:39.880]  the same time the tsa was threatening to turn texas into a no fly zone now he's
[55:39.880 --> 55:44.720]  out telling people don't worry the government doesn't have any malice
[55:44.720 --> 55:49.920]  towards you they respect your liberty they respect your rights I don't think
[55:49.920 --> 55:53.200]  he's a very credible spokesperson for that and we're going to talk about his
[55:53.200 --> 55:57.080]  CIA background as well as the thing that things that he's been saying when we
[55:57.080 --> 55:59.840]  talked to Joe in the next hour at the bottom of the hour we're going to have
[55:59.840 --> 56:04.600]  Alex Jones reply to what happened a special report from him about what
[56:04.600 --> 56:08.400]  happened with Facebook and of course we've been talking about the article
[56:08.400 --> 56:13.920]  where they suspended our admin privileges for our main admin account
[56:13.920 --> 56:18.320]  because of an innocuous picture that was put up picture that was not violent
[56:18.320 --> 56:23.200]  showed no blood no weapons nothing merely a man in a balaclava and a camo
[56:23.200 --> 56:29.280]  with a flag behind him and a quote from Stalin any excuse to shut things down
[56:29.280 --> 56:34.280]  that's where we're headed now if you want to support us we have a special we
[56:34.280 --> 56:39.360]  have a water 20 promo code 20% off of all proprio water filtration supplies
[56:39.360 --> 56:43.080]  through the weekend that's a special you'll find right now at info or store
[56:43.080 --> 56:48.840]  dot com also now is the time to prepare for storable food you can get it at great
[56:48.840 --> 56:52.680]  prices at info wars store dot com but again one of our biggest specials ever
[56:52.680 --> 56:59.560]  on proprio water filters water 20 for 20% off of all of the proprio water filters
[56:59.560 --> 57:04.680]  of any size you know when I look at the fluoridation of water and we look at the
[57:04.680 --> 57:10.200]  fact that they're trying to mandate vaccines for people I as I look at the
[57:10.200 --> 57:13.040]  removal of informed consent I say you know they removed that a long time ago
[57:13.040 --> 57:17.840]  when they started fluoridating our water if you can dump stuff into people's
[57:17.840 --> 57:23.280]  water supply if you can mass medicate the public without their consent they
[57:23.280 --> 57:27.480]  can do anything and now they are doing that to people because we have tried and
[57:27.480 --> 57:31.960]  been unable in most jurisdictions to get the fluoridation process reversed so
[57:31.960 --> 57:36.360]  they basically pay large amounts of money for corporate waste which they then
[57:36.360 --> 57:42.120]  dump into the water and even if even if you believe that this is safe or
[57:42.120 --> 57:45.360]  effective and it is neither and we're not going to go into all the details of
[57:45.360 --> 57:48.600]  fluoridation we've talked about that many times but even if you think that it's a
[57:48.600 --> 57:53.400]  healthy thing let me ask you how you control the dosage when you just dump
[57:53.400 --> 57:57.440]  it into the water supply and of course the federal government has just admitted
[57:57.440 --> 58:00.960]  that they're allowed dosages were far too high and they have just lowered that
[58:00.960 --> 58:06.680]  and those allowed dosages are twice what we have seen in other countries
[58:06.680 --> 58:10.520]  producing deleterious effects on people's health but they're giving you
[58:10.520 --> 58:15.440]  the same dosage whether you're a child or a full-grown adult now stay with us
[58:15.440 --> 58:17.720]  right after the break for those of you who are listening we're going to talk
[58:17.720 --> 58:22.040]  about what's going on with the vaccine bills that are mandating this that are
[58:22.040 --> 58:25.920]  taking away our freedom and then we're going to have in the next hour Joe Bigs

[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:33.560]  Knight your host joining us in the next segment will be Joe Biggs we're going to
[01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:38.800]  talk about the latest developments in Jade Helm right now it is a propaganda
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:42.440]  war it's a Psyop war and that's a large part of what it's going to be as well
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:45.800]  we're going to talk about what's going on the latest developments in it of course
[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:50.560]  one Texas congressman has come out bravely and said yeah we need to be
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:53.840]  concerned about what the government is doing we need to watch what the
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:57.840]  government's doing Louis Gomert and of course he knows that he's going to be
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:01.960]  vilified he knows that they are going to ridicule him that they are going to
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:07.760]  come after him personally make strawman arguments about how he's irrationally
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:12.800]  paranoid I would say if there's any party on the earth that is irrationally
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:17.360]  paranoid it has to be the federal government they criticize people who are
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:20.880]  preppers they criticize people who want to understand what our government is
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:25.920]  doing yet they are the ones who are doing the most extreme things everywhere
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:30.920]  and then demanding that we not pay any attention to it is all at all this for
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:34.000]  example this story that's up on the dredge report right now from info wars
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:40.400]  com DHS funded spy tag knows when you visit the bathroom and when I saw this
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:43.440]  I thought about the dredge report story that's been up for the last couple days
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:48.800]  about the mayor here just north of Austin a place called Georgetown Texas passed
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:53.560]  the torch over to the mayor pro tem and went to the restroom and had a lav mic on
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:58.400]  remember they had that guy the that had killed several people they caught him in
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:02.720]  a documentary when he went to the restroom and he says I'll kill him all
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:09.040]  now he's under arrest he had beaten the rap for decades but he got nailed by a
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:14.560]  lav mic that was still turned on well the same thing happened in Georgetown the
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:20.040]  guy walks off and that that video is very funny especially when he flushes the
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:23.680]  toilet everybody breaks down laughing that at the time I saw it a couple days
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:30.600]  ago it had 2.8 million views so that is everywhere but this stuff is serious we
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:36.400]  have a paranoid dangerous government that wants to know everything about us
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:43.320]  they want to track everywhere we go when they negotiate trade deals in secret
[01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:46.680]  when they passed laws and secret when our congressmen our elected
[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:50.680]  representatives are told get out of here you can't see this when they talk
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:55.840]  about stakeholders are going to put this together then you understand that we the
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:59.640]  people don't have a stake in this our elected representatives don't have a
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:03.560]  stake in it we are not stakeholders it's the stakeholders who are putting
[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:07.560]  together the Trans-Pacific Partnership in secret and we need to just shut up and
[01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:12.920]  now we got Mitch McConnell just giddy just giddy about how he and Obama are
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:17.120]  now buds you know they just you won't believe this but you know we just get
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:21.560]  along great on this trade agreement it's like no I believe it I believe it I
[01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:26.120]  know where this is going Alex Jones has been talking about it for decades we all
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:30.280]  know where this is going Barry Goldwater knew where this is going decades ago as
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:33.360]  well we just read that quote earlier in the show we know exactly where this is
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:37.440]  going Mitch I have no problem at all believing that you and Obama are just
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:41.440]  laughing it up over what you're doing to the American people but this is a
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:45.600]  government that wants to know everywhere we go including the bathroom as Paul
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:50.200]  Joseph Watson points out a new RFID tag designed to track objects or people in a
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:54.080]  closed environment unquote which is being funded by the Department of Homeland
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:57.720]  Security even has the ability to know when you visit the bathroom and as one
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:00.200]  person says how long before they incorporate this technology into
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:05.600]  driver's licenses that's a privacy blog mass private eye can you say real ID
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:09.560]  DHS is National Driver's License Tracking Program when they're installed in
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:13.760]  your driver's license they'll know where which vehicle you're driving well yeah
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:17.880]  you know what they've already got black boxes we've talked about this over and
[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:22.320]  over again they've already got the black boxes in your car they just need the
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:28.960]  Wi-Fi capability and they have mandated that I believe that the v2v technology
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:32.840]  which the Department of Transportation out of Washington laughingly calls
[01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:38.720]  talking cars that's going to be here within I think it's either 2016 or 2017
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:41.360]  they're gonna start mandating that in cars and the new cars then they will
[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:45.200]  retrofit it to the older cars and guess what they're going to be talking about
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:49.880]  you who will they be talking to you about the government tracking
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:53.200]  everything you do stay with us we'll be right back with Joe Biggs talking about
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:05:03.960]  Jade Howell new claims made by ISIS the terror group says they have 71 soldiers
[01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:08.040]  trained in 15 different states ready to attack any target they desire the post
[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:12.040]  also claims 23 soldiers have signed up for missions like Sunday a reference to
[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:15.160]  the attack in Garland Texas that resulted in the wounding of a security
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:18.040]  guard and the killing of the two attackers by a single police officer
[01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:21.920]  with a sidearm ISIS claims their target and Sunday's attack was Pamela Geller
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:25.680]  Abu Abreem said in the post we don't care what land she hides in or what
[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:29.600]  sky shields her we will send all of our lines to achieve her slaughter Geller
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:33.160]  heads the group responsible for the draw Muhammad event in Garland Texas which
[01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:36.760]  is part of a larger network of neocon organizations working behind the scenes
[01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:40.920]  to stoke tensions between Muslims Christians and Jews she responded this
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:44.480]  threat illustrates the savagery and barbarism of the Islamic State they
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:48.480]  want me dead for violating Sharia blasphemy laws what remains to be seen is
[01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:52.160]  whether the free world will wake up and stand for the freedom of speech or instead

[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:19.580]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight on this Wednesday May 6
[01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:24.880]  2015 joining me now in the studio is Joe Biggs we've had I guess we've been
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:29.200]  featured in the news we've got former lieutenant governor David Dewhurst is
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:33.040]  going around making the talk show circuit see immediately jumped on this as
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:37.360]  soon as governor Abbott sympathize with concerns of citizens because you know
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:41.440]  somebody with a CIA background Joe like David Dewhurst you know citizens don't
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:44.240]  need to know what's going on number one number two you don't need to be
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:47.080]  concerned if they have concerns just ignore them they're just peons and
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:50.640]  peasants they're not stakeholders right so just just ignore them so he
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:54.040]  criticized of course making some political points and now he's going on
[01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:57.800]  CNN we're gonna play a clip of that in a moment but it goes on to say that you
[01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:01.040]  know a lot of people go on you know and say Texas one of the greatest states this
[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:05.160]  kind of proves the fact we have a good governor as well who's willing to help
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:09.920]  kind of calm everyone down a bit yeah he heard his constituents he's heard what
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:14.120]  people are worried about and he's gonna actually do something about it I think
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:17.400]  that's that's amazing and I don't know why they want to attack him over that the
[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:22.120]  people that's his job yes he's doing his job I would like it to have some
[01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:28.440]  politicians who are aware of what our concerns are and exactly in Bastrop we've
[01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:33.040]  got the the judge there who basically he's not really like a legal judge a
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:37.040]  judicial judge he's actually the chief administrator County basically he's he
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:40.520]  had that dog and pony show there of the lieutenant colonel that was involved in
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:43.960]  the operation and he said we're not here to change people's minds and it's like
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:49.240]  well what are you here for care less what we think it was a televised
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:53.440]  scythe it all was because what they did is they were doing damage control from
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:57.760]  when Thomas meet a metrics global originally posted that video where they
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:00.840]  were talking about Jade home and they he really told the truth about what was
[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:05.080]  going on that there would be interaction in civilian attire in the public and
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:09.240]  that cops see someone to pull them over things like that this time it was
[01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:15.400]  Lieutenant Colonel Mark Lestoria as the puppet for this you know contract
[01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:19.760]  company for this guy and then you know I think jacar is actually working on a
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:23.800]  video we're going to show how many times Mark Lestoria looks back at Thomas me
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:26.960]  to see like is it okay like checking with his puppet master like oh am I
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:29.360]  doing the right thing because that's all they were they were just trying to
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:33.000]  damage exactly just like we see with the Trans Pacific Partnership you can't
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:36.040]  read that agreement you can't take any pictures of it you can't talk to
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:39.720]  anybody about it and when we tell you what it says exactly but I mean we see
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:43.360]  that even our congressmen don't have any power right and so you got this guy
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:47.560]  who's a lieutenant colonel he's looking at this guy in the suit company for
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:50.680]  authorization for everything he's got to do everybody that attended that meeting
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:53.800]  had that comment they couldn't believe how he kept referring that guy and it
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:57.000]  was actually a guy who stood up and said well you've introduced yourself but
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:00.400]  who is this guy in the suit yeah keep talking to looking at and talking to
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:04.120]  because he will be the one running the operation Lieutenant Mark Lestoria is
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:08.680]  just a puppet yeah he is just a face for so calm to go up there and stand and
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:13.000]  to help calm some people with his little sigh op that he was running out there it
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.320]  was complete and total BS the people there did not buy what he was saying I
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:20.280]  didn't buy it you know I jacari would I mean me and him would look at each other
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:23.640]  and be like what is this guy talking about it completely contradicted the
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:28.400]  original thing they came out to do yes I mean it's well of course the spend wise
[01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:31.600]  that they were going to do this on private property okay they already had
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:34.520]  permission so you got a problem with private property just shut up it's none
[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:38.240]  of your business what's done on private property making it sound as if private
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:42.160]  property owners had initiated this whole training up for you like they put out
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:45.240]  some Craigslist ad or something like that hey we're so calm do you mind giving up
[01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:49.120]  your hundreds of acres so we can come out here and then these people called it
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:52.800]  implied no and what I talked to I've got a guy that I'm gonna go on his property
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:57.760]  when the when the training starts he's next to he's lined up with another
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:02.560]  property who gave up a hundred something acres for this and he said that the
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:06.280]  government came knocked on the door to people's properties saying hey can we
[01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:10.600]  come do this so they lied in the entire well the whole slide show that was up
[01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:13.880]  there the very beginning of it they didn't as a purpose that we're here the
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:16.680]  purpose we're here to give you this slideshow and they went to all these
[01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:19.720]  different local governments all over Texas you taught everywhere that they're
[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:25.200]  going and they said the purpose is to get a written invitation from local city
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:31.120]  council from the the county government why would they need to have written
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:35.120]  permission from the local governments if it's all about private property exactly
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:39.760]  yeah he keeps spinning this one way after the other and it was interesting when
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:43.560]  I got the call from the local ABC affiliate asking me you know why are you
[01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:48.840]  guys so afraid and she had gone to the Bastrop meeting and she had even written
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:52.240]  an article on it the day after on Tuesday the Bastrop meeting was on Monday
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:56.080]  she wrote an article on on Tuesday I talked to her on Wednesday and when I
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:59.480]  mentioned that I said well look at the very purpose here she says are they not
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:01.920]  telling you the truth about something so yeah they said they're looking for
[01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:05.440]  written permission from the local governments and then they say this is
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:08.640]  all about private property so just shut up I said and she said would you read
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:12.720]  that from I said that's in the slideshow they put out the document that
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:15.960]  there's a basis for this whole report to start with this but of course you know
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:19.440]  we've been doing reports on the militarization of the police for a very
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:24.600]  long time but the point is is that the milk that the press is not really
[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:28.940]  doing any investigation on this we see nothing but just using the term
[01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:33.920]  conspiracy theory dismissing it that way becoming a mockingbird press and
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:37.560]  that's what the same it's the same cookie cutter answer every time from CNN from
[01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:40.320]  Fox and all these places yeah they say the same thing they push out the same
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:44.080]  narrative none of them have done any actual investigation I mean just like
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:48.320]  when they say there's no ISIS in in Mexico or in Texas okay now we know yeah
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:52.080]  you know we actually went and looked they don't do it they just read off a
[01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:55.760]  teleprompter and that's what's ridiculous I don't know how people can Google as a
[01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:58.880]  reporter I mean they don't even go in and Google this to look up what's going
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:01.480]  on they don't know anything about what unconventional warfare is they haven't
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:04.880]  looked at the documents they don't know the history of the training you and I
[01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:09.320]  were in Fort A.P. Hill which is an asymmetric warfare center a year ago we
[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:13.440]  were walking through it Alex was broadcasting it live they spent 96
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:19.080]  million dollars to create a replica of an American city that was very different
[01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:22.480]  from the kinds of urban warfare that you've seen in practice with bombed out
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:25.720]  buildings and that sort of thing going building to building spent 96 million
[01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:28.560]  dollars and of course it was supposed to be somewhere in the 60 million dollar
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:32.040]  there's some clips of it right now of where we were last year it was originally
[01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:36.760]  budgeted for a 60-some-odd million dollars so that's 50% over budget just
[01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:40.160]  like the Pentagon always does but that's not good enough for them they've got to
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:43.840]  come into America so that looks just like Iraq right there yeah yeah there's a
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:49.520]  school bus the roads don't have potholes from I.D.'s there's a mosque over there I
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:53.960]  mean that there you know we have Muslims in America yeah but there's traffic
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:57.720]  lights oh there's a church yeah man this looks just like Afghanistan my mind's
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:02.560]  blown I mean but it was very creepy when we were there because you know there
[01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:06.600]  underground tunnels that connected subway stations something that looked
[01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:10.080]  like these just said a torture facility but also the fact that they've got
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:14.720]  working traffic lights they've got the underground subway you and I stood at
[01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:17.640]  the corner of first in Maine I took your picture at the corner of first in
[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:21.280]  Maine I mean that is not a foreign country when you look at this they're
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:26.000]  training for domestic operations you know that there's a lot of things that
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:29.880]  could cause that they could use as an excuse for martial law that's what
[01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:32.760]  they're training for over and over again that's why we're concerned about the
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:37.400]  scope the frequency and the scale of these things continuing to increase every
[01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:40.320]  year well what people don't understand and they have to go back and look at
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:45.280]  some of these original hit pieces against us when we posted those slides when
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:51.480]  we showed that initial SOCOM report SOCOM came out and said they didn't know
[01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:54.880]  where those slides came from yes exactly people have to go back and look and look
[01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:58.720]  at the underlying things that are going on they're continuously lying to the
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:02.360]  American people every day and then the Pentagon goes oh we don't know anything
[01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:05.320]  about this we deny this well the Pentagon denies everything the Pentagon
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:10.320]  doesn't know where they are half the time I mean it is mind-blown to see how
[01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:14.880]  they try to hit us on every angle and if it was nothing at all they wouldn't
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:17.720]  even talk about it they know it's true that's why these Pentagon puppets are
[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:20.840]  going hey Foxy and you got to discredit these guys you got to discredit these
[01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:23.760]  guys they're trying to they're finding out what's going on yes I told that to
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:27.840]  the reporter I said from the very beginning they denied that I have no
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:30.400]  knowledge of that I don't even know what you're talking about I can't post it
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:36.000]  on your page but of course Drudge linked the actual document unscribed they
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:40.520]  could go to scribe yeah take a look at it but that was their response I have no
[01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:43.800]  idea what you're talking about when it got big that's when they came out and
[01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:46.200]  then they started changing their story and they keep changing their story
[01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:51.160]  because fundamentally fundamentally this is a psychological operation if you
[01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:54.200]  look at what unconventional yeah if you look at what unconventional warfare is
[01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:59.680]  it is a psychological operation it is a means and and quite frankly what Obama
[01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:03.040]  has been doing to this country what George Bush was doing to this country
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:08.080]  was unconventional warfare is basically destroying our a country's economics
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:12.480]  destroying their civil liberties taking away people's ability and their will to
[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:16.600]  resist okay and that's the way you do it that's in the military documents you
[01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:19.880]  destroy them economically you destroy their civil liberties you take their
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:23.800]  rights away you treat them like slaves and and make them realize they don't
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:27.280]  have a future and then they just give up in hopelessness and as this and as this
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:31.360]  and as this entire saw is going on what else is going on the militarization of
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:35.640]  the police the dropping off of these huge M-Ranks M-Raps and tanks in different
[01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:39.560]  cities across America they are strategically placing all this heavy
[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:44.040]  armored equipment all over the country while people are concerned now with the
[01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:47.960]  the conspiracy theories and all this they're putting all their chess pieces
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:51.680]  in play yes and they do it one at a time yes okay it was a couple of years ago
[01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:57.040]  that Watson found the Fed biz ops procurements for billions of rounds
[01:17:57.040 --> 01:18:00.200]  of ammunition as we did the math at the time if you added up what Homeland
[01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:03.160]  Security was buying and these are hollow point bullets this is not allowed
[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:07.360]  under Geneva Convention to be used by the military it was being purchased by
[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:11.200]  Homeland Security it was hollow point bullets which governments are only allowed
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:14.680]  to use against their citizens okay and they got billions of them and as we
[01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:20.040]  pointed out that's equivalent to 30 years worth of the weight rate that they
[01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:23.320]  were going through it and Conrock war yes exactly in combat these way they're
[01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:27.440]  stockpiling enough to fight a decades-long war then the next year comes
[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:30.360]  around a while they do on their stockpiling M-Raps another military
[01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:34.720]  equipment prepositioning it in local communities putting it on the dime of
[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:37.840]  the local communities to pay for the maintenance of these things while they
[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:41.960]  retain ownership of it so that they can then come in and take it over whenever
[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:45.400]  they wish now we see this training which has been going on at the same time
[01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:48.800]  simultaneously over and over again and two years ago I was talking about all
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:52.160]  the military drills that were going on in all the different cities then a year
[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:55.360]  ago we were at Fort AP Hill we walked through the asymmetric warfare center
[01:18:55.360 --> 01:19:00.360]  now they're doing a massive massive training exercise across the United
[01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:03.120]  States they're buying up all the ammo they're buying up all the guns meanwhile
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:06.440]  places like in Baltimore at a Walmart outside of like 30 minutes outside of
[01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:13.600]  there are going whoa we're gonna need to pull the the ammo yeah we can have
[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:16.440]  this I mean there's a civil unrest going on oh that's when you kind of need to
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:20.560]  be able to protect yourself that's the entire point of having that right to be
[01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:24.160]  able to protect yourself and your property your family if something happens
[01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:28.360]  yes when this arm is what happens when people are disarmed ISIS attacks yeah
[01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:31.760]  yeah look what happened when ISIS came to Texas we carry guns don't mess with
[01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:35.000]  Texas I guess that's something ISIS never heard about we got guns all right
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.600]  that's right and it isn't just the hired security guards they paid $10,000 to get
[01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:42.200]  a lot of off-duty cops and these guys know how to shoot but of course there's
[01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:44.880]  a lot of Texans who know how to shoot and are carrying as well we'll be right
[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:47.920]  back with Joe Biggs and we're gonna play you what Lieutenant gun former
[01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:53.360]  Lieutenant Governor David Hearst former CIA agent is saying about us stay with
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:56.000]  us we'll be right back
[01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:04.680]  it's very easy to be a criminal all you need to burglarize a home is one simple
[01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:08.680]  household tool a pair of scissors if your home security system can be
[01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:12.680]  compromised by a criminal using scissors then you're making it easy for them
[01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:17.080]  almost every home security system even those sold by big-name companies has a
[01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:21.960]  weakness the phone line you shell out 1500 bucks get locked into a long-term

[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:21.200]  Biggs and we're gonna be talking about Jade Helm in this segment we're going to
[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:25.280]  talk specifically about the former lieutenant governor of Texas David
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:30.240]  Dohurst who's going around talking about Jade Helm telling people hey there's
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:33.600]  nothing to be concerned about move along I mean if you're a patriot what
[01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:37.960]  problem do you have with the government training to take people out in the
[01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:40.720]  middle of the night and putting them in white vans and driving them off I mean
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:43.760]  you shouldn't have anything at all to say about that that's an American to not
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:46.580]  like that absolutely so we're gonna play the clip from him it's about a one
[01:24:46.580 --> 01:24:51.320]  minute clip on CNN before we do I want to let you know that we've got a special
[01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:55.640]  right now for Pro Pure the biggest discount we've had water 20 is a promo

[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:15.720]  Joe let's go to this clip from David Dohurst on CNN where he's talking
[01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:20.080]  essentially about us let's let's play that clip former state representative
[01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:25.600]  Todd Smith again a fellow Republican sent a staving letter to Abbott he
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:31.600]  accused him of quote pandering to idiots is Governor Abbott pandering to
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:36.040]  idiots so we're saying people who are scared. I think Governor Abbott was listening to his
[01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:42.280]  constituents I think this was fueled by talk show hosts talk show hosts that are
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:47.920]  more interested in their ratings than telling the truth and so all I tried to
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:53.480]  do with my editorial and talking every day to people is to remind them that we've
[01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:58.480]  had training exercises going through Texas since we were first formed as a
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:04.760]  Republican now as a state and that Texans love the military we support the
[01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:09.720]  military and if I've got any message is to all of our active duty is unpatriotic
[01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:14.560]  to question the mission of the military that we already have this we got your
[01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:18.760]  back huge doubt over the Obama administration no one trusts them that's
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:24.800]  what Ted Cruz said and you know I quite frankly I I don't know what to say
[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:31.120]  except that it is our right and it is our duty as citizens to ask what our
[01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:35.720]  military is doing exactly they tell you to just shut up because I'm wearing a
[01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:39.400]  uniform I'm sorry I don't live in that country I'm never gonna live in that
[01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:43.320]  country I don't honor that kind of response look at the way they've got the
[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:47.240]  map there you're either permissive or your hostile mm-hmm okay that's their
[01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:51.360]  bifurcated world okay that's their two choices you're either permit them to do
[01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:54.800]  whatever they want without them telling you anything about it without them
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:59.080]  answering any of your questions and how dare you even talk about what the
[01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:03.520]  rightful mission of our military ought to be okay because then your anti military
[01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:06.800]  there's a big difference about that and we need to understand that we've had
[01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:09.920]  that discussion before we've talked about whether or not our government should
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:14.720]  be involved in wars I don't want to get back to this thing just shut up we're
[01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:17.840]  going to invade this country going to invade that country and you don't have
[01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:22.040]  any say so on and if you do you're an American that's essentially what he's
[01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:24.920]  telling people I mean people have to look at the fact look at all these lies
[01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:28.640]  that are building up time after time they keep saying these training exercises
[01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:33.280]  are other dirty bomb drills or this is to help further our National Guard or
[01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:38.720]  this is to help hone our skills against a foreign enemy okay so why is your dirty
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:42.520]  bomb drill have nothing to do with a dirty bomb and have to do with the
[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:47.040]  soldiers taking on sovereign citizens constitutionalist patriots crowd control
[01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:50.520]  that doesn't sound anything like a dirty bomb to me you know and they're saying
[01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:54.800]  oh Jade Helm it's just so we can hone our skills for overseas negative and we
[01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:58.240]  just had the Pentagon come out and defense officials said on Monday that
[01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:04.240]  this is all just wild speculation internet-fueled claims okay well why do
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:09.400]  they not say that it's wild speculation when they do these scenarios as Forbes
[01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:13.040]  reprinted it how the military would take out the Tea Party isn't that wild
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:16.600]  speculation maybe that's just wild speculation why don't they take that
[01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:20.760]  back why don't they explain to us these repeated training scenarios where they
[01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:24.400]  come after people who are conservatives libertarians tea partiers people who
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:28.280]  voted for Ron Paul and of course Louis Gohmert had the courage to come out
[01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:33.520]  today even after all this mud has been slung and I would say a lot of this you
[01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:37.480]  can understand the politics behind it okay David Dewhurst is not simply
[01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:41.360]  speaking for the CIA he's speaking for David Dewhurst politician and so is Todd
[01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:46.000]  Smith they mentioned Todd Smith this is an obscure Texas legislator who lost in
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:52.520]  the primary in 2012 65 to 35 because his big issue that he championed was no
[01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:57.560]  voter ID he was Republican he was a rhino same as David Dewhurst but you've
[01:28:57.560 --> 01:29:01.480]  got Louis Gohmert coming out and saying yeah I understand why they would be
[01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:04.720]  concerned about this he said when leaders within the current administration
[01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:07.720]  believe that major threats to the country include those who support the
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:12.960]  Constitution who are military veterans or who cling to guns and religion
[01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:16.480]  patriotic Americans have reason to be concerned that's what Louis Gohmert
[01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:21.080]  security has targets so like pregnant women and children yes they're saying
[01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:26.040]  the veterans are number one target and yet we're crazy yes to question this
[01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:31.240]  exercise it's going on I walked through the live target AP Hill the asymmetric
[01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:35.760]  warfare center which was an American city it had the same effect as those no
[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:38.680]  hesitation targets stay with us we're going to be right back with a special
[01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:42.800]  report from Alex Jones about this Facebook attack on info wars stay with
[01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:45.360]  us we'll be right back
[01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:57.520]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:29:57.520 --> 01:30:04.520]  you've probably heard a lot in the news recently about Jade Helm the army says
[01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:08.720]  it's a harmless drill that uses states like Texas to simulate rugged foreign
[01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:13.040]  terrain fine let's take that at face value they're training in an area that
[01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:17.360]  simulates the locale where they plan to fight got it with that said if they
[01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:21.520]  train where they plan to fight then why do we see military drills in downtown
[01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:26.120]  Miami Florida what cave in Afghanistan does that resemble why did we see the
[01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:30.600]  military team up with the Halo Corps to run a drill in San Diego California what
[01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:34.480]  desert in Iraq does that city look like I'm willing to hear these guys out when
[01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:38.560]  they say let's train now so we don't bleed later but that opens up a whole new
[01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:42.960]  can of worms when they train in facilities like Fort AP Hill a facility
[01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:47.080]  that looks like any American city complete with soccer fields churches and
[01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:51.200]  street signs in English presenting even more questions that have yet to be

[01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:32.680]  going to go back to Jade Helm but Alex cut a special report today about this
[01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:38.240]  Facebook blocking our account on Facebook they put up a notice that we were
[01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:41.760]  blocked for three days from posting we have now found a workaround for that
[01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:45.720]  nevertheless if you look at this image it is totally innocuous there's
[01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:50.560]  absolutely nothing controversial about it there's no blood guns knives nothing
[01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:55.800]  simply a guy in a bella clava with a camo suit and a flag in the background and
[01:33:55.800 --> 01:33:59.880]  a Stalin quote and for that they were going to block our Facebook account for
[01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:05.000]  three days here's what Alex Jones has to report in Nazi Germany and in many other
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:10.280]  nations that have fallen to tyranny throughout history generally the takeover
[01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:18.040]  is done incrementally that's the surest way long term to take a free society and
[01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:25.800]  to be able to convert it into a despotic system the United States according to
[01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:32.480]  rafts of university studies around the world is trending into a total fascist
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:37.120]  system controlled by foreign offshore corporate interests that are above the
[01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:41.880]  law Bilderberg Davos they're transferring all the nation-state powers and do
[01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:48.320]  process into things like the TPP the Transpacific Partnership and other
[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:54.680]  systems the WTO they're militarizing our police they are surveilling us without
[01:34:54.680 --> 01:35:00.440]  warrants from Australia to the United States from Germany to England from
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:05.640]  South Africa to Mexico the same systems of tyranny are being globally
[01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:14.000]  standardized and deployed info wars is in trouble info wars is under massive
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:19.160]  attack and a lot of pundits a lot of analysts have always pointed out that
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:26.120]  info wars.com is seen as a canary in the coal mine that when the system really
[01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:32.520]  starts to come after us in the info war that Hillary admits we're winning you're
[01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:37.080]  winning you are the info war we're just one focal point of that that the
[01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:40.160]  hammers dropping and it's not just us and I'm gonna break down what's happening
[01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:46.320]  in a moment it's the internet power grab by the FCC it's the TPP provision the
[01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:49.520]  one part that got leaked where it gives total internet control over the private
[01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:53.800]  corporations under copyright or under terms of use violation where you're
[01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:58.720]  banned from the web internet taxes internet IDs to track you Zuckerberg
[01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:05.040]  from Facebook meeting with the Chinese censors two months ago it's on and we've
[01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:09.560]  seen a seismic increase of persecution of the press not just here but all the
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:17.200]  western world a seismic increase exponential in censorship but in the
[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:23.840]  last month whether it's been YouTube or whether it's been Facebook or whether
[01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:29.040]  it's been Alexa owned by Amazon and dirty tricks behind the scenes you wouldn't
[01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:34.400]  believe the system is intensifying massive attacks against us right now and
[01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:41.520]  if they can shut us down or cripple us they can shut you down info wars is
[01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:45.800]  breaking national news every day we're generating top news stories that affect
[01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:49.840]  change every week or so that become the biggest stories in the country like Jade
[01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:56.720]  Helm the TSA you name it one of the committee members of the FCC one of
[01:36:56.720 --> 01:37:00.520]  the commissioners came out three days ago and said they've been in meetings and
[01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:06.080]  they're looking at trying to take down drudge they can take down drudge under
[01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:09.960]  federal elections commission claiming his free speech is electioneering it's
[01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:14.520]  over folks you understand we've been basically delisted by Alexa saying we
[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:19.160]  have no visitors even our ratings are up and every pro-globalist organization has
[01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:23.400]  gone up as we go down every libertarian or conservative group Fox News was
[01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:27.480]  delisted and lost 80% of their traffic the same day we did but the traffic's
[01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:32.200]  still there that's where ad agencies go to make purchasing decisions Fox News
[01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:35.640]  won't even stand up for itself because I guess it's basically part of it they're
[01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:39.960]  attacking us as well I was attacked by CNN last night saying that we believe the
[01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:43.000]  military's gonna take over this summer when we said it's all part of
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:46.920]  conditioning they literally edited the tape down to three seconds to make it
[01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:49.960]  sound like I said that we're gonna play that coming up here with David Knight
[01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:54.880]  today I'm taking off the radio show this is so big today to get with lawyers
[01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:59.560]  talk to some lawyers in New York and to decide what I'm gonna do because I have
[01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:03.680]  to try to talk to the electronic frontier foundation the EFF and others
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:07.440]  they've helped us out before we've had issues I've had to sue people before I
[01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:11.800]  don't make a big deal about it some of the lawyers involved have lost their
[01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:16.600]  licenses you know that have gone after us there's a lot of stuff I gotta deal
[01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:23.960]  with I have to come to a decision today and start pulling some triggers but most
[01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:28.960]  importantly just know this the canary sick the canary is under attack there's
[01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:33.440]  gas in the mine this is affecting everybody they're coming after your
[01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:37.400]  internet freedom their power grabbing on every level they've got the IRS
[01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:41.480]  persecuting second amendment groups Christian groups veterans groups they
[01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:46.120]  got veterans on don't treat death list and a year's gone by and nothing's
[01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:50.720]  happened they've been admitted last week in the news oh nothing's changed I mean
[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:54.880]  stuff's getting crazy folks and why are they allowing censorship they're
[01:38:54.880 --> 01:38:59.320]  testing it he's another bird analogy like a parent or bird will test a perch to
[01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:03.080]  make sure it's stable with its beak before it gets on it they're testing to
[01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:06.600]  see what happens they're probing they're pushing Obama to solve the borders
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:09.480]  didn't get in trouble Obama put our military NATO command didn't get in
[01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:13.160]  trouble funded ISIS and al Qaeda didn't get in trouble over through our allies
[01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:17.360]  in Egypt put Muslim Brotherhood in didn't get in trouble and he's just a
[01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:21.200]  front man for this agenda but the police are very bold right now starting a war
[01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:26.280]  with Russia destabilizing countries destabilizing our nation shutting down
[01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:31.160]  half our power plants the last seven years we're under attack and that's why
[01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:34.320]  the population's lost trust in the government because it's illegitimate and
[01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:41.000]  now the system knows people are listing the info wars.com as a conduit so
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:44.480]  they're coming in on us and just to understand that ladies and gentlemen
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:48.640]  that you need to pray for us even if you're not a Christian just try to
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:52.960]  support us tell your friends and family about the broadcast send them links to
[01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:57.440]  the podcast to the info wars.com forward slash show page tell them about local
[01:39:57.440 --> 01:40:02.360]  affiliate method in your area get aggressive about this because nothing
[01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:05.840]  can stop human intelligence and human action in word of mouth you're the
[01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:08.880]  reason we're exploding you're the reason citizens are putting up billboards for
[01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:13.120]  info wars.com across the country you're the reason we're gaining affiliates but
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:17.600]  if they can de-list us as they did today and kick us off Facebook we have 3
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:21.960]  million likes our biggest we have like 14 different Facebooks our biggest one
[01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:25.480]  has 800 plus thousand we noticed it was going towards a million suddenly sort of
[01:40:25.480 --> 01:40:30.720]  getting reversed about a month ago sort of losing them now they used us putting
[01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:36.400]  up an image no violence in a news article of ISIS and they banned us for
[01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:39.760]  three days they say they may permanently ban us you go to CNN's Facebook there's
[01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:44.520]  images of ISIS all over it people say well they own that they can do that no
[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:47.640]  they advertise that you come there and put your content on and as long as you
[01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:50.840]  follow their rules they won't take you down but then they selectively violate
[01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:55.560]  that no one's safe if they can take your website down because you put an image up
[01:40:55.560 --> 01:40:59.880]  of an ISIS fighter and we basically say they're terrorist and I guess it's
[01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:03.240]  because we call them terrorists and the Obama administration won't under new
[01:41:03.240 --> 01:41:08.600]  political correctness and they've told us you cannot call them terrorist so
[01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:12.680]  under new political correctness you cannot call radicalism terrorist I mean a
[01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:16.560]  federal judge ruled kids can't wear American flags at school because they're
[01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:24.000]  offensive I mean if we lose our speech we lose everything and it's all
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:27.920]  intensifying it's coming down and look at the economy look at the zero point two
[01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:30.920]  percent growth probably like three percent two percent negative it's what
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:34.720]  most economists say we're in trouble something big is coming is it the
[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:40.360]  dollar devaluation is it a bigger war governments are gearing up there's a
[01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:44.360]  lot of preparation Soros is trying to start riots with the police this
[01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:49.720]  country's being destabilized and info wars is under attack like you've never
[01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:55.440]  done before in their face we need to promote info wars promote the radio
[01:41:55.440 --> 01:41:58.920]  show promote the video feeds promote these articles you see on info wars
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:02.600]  dot com principle on it dot com nothing can stop you from posting on on
[01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:06.720]  Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and on your own message boards and Pinterest
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:10.620]  and Craigslist and everywhere else and at the end of your emails a link to our
[01:42:10.620 --> 01:42:14.480]  video feeds or audio feeds get out there and show them the power you've got
[01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:19.160]  let's have a people bomb against tyranny let's have a anti-tyranny bomb
[01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:25.840]  today on this Wednesday what the sixth day of May 2015 to let the system know
[01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:28.840]  we're fighting back because the good news is this is the Empire striking back
[01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:33.640]  we're beginning to win that's why they're launching this operation but I've
[01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:36.600]  got to take action to defend the First Amendment they're trying to ram through
[01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:40.720]  the TPP right now that's secret the one provision that was released because
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:46.160]  WikiLeaks got it they admit internet freedom and allows corporations to
[01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:50.200]  kick you off the web not just their sites because they say so no judge no
[01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:56.320]  jury corporate global governance and whether it's Zuckerberg or the head of
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:43:02.920]  Amazon they're all working with Obama to shut down free speech my god where is
[01:43:02.920 --> 01:43:06.520]  the so-called left on this I attack Bush for his tyranny it was nothing
[01:43:06.520 --> 01:43:10.600]  compared to this this has gone into overdrive are you really gonna let them
[01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:14.520]  arrest people in the Tea Party and shut down Christian churches and tell the
[01:43:14.520 --> 01:43:18.240]  troops they can't be Christians and the founding fathers were bad people I mean
[01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:21.600]  this is this is like a giant reeducation camp this country's being
[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:27.400]  turned into and just support our local affiliates we support them we get the
[01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:31.280]  ratings we get the advertisers for folks locally but it isn't enough because the
[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:34.080]  establishment is targeting our affiliates as well in dirty trick
[01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:37.920]  campaigns they're lying and saying that we said things we didn't say if you
[01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:44.040]  don't hear it out of my mouth we didn't say it when MSNBC says I'm a racist or
[01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:48.760]  I influenced the bombers of the Boston bombing and then they don't show a clip
[01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:52.320]  they wouldn't be getting that outrageous in their propaganda if they weren't
[01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:56.280]  desperate I'm Alex Jones I'm gonna pass the baton to David Knight I'll be
[01:43:56.280 --> 01:44:00.080]  calling in later with some updates on this but this is a big deal and if
[01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:03.640]  tyranny came would we notice if tyranny came would we do something if tyranny
[01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:08.120]  came would we wake up and say no you're being tested right now they're not just
[01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:11.760]  coming out for us the censorship is intensifying across the board but we're
[01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:16.720]  being hammered by name in over a hundred publications a day CNN and Fox News
[01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:21.320]  last night it was ABC News the night before last week every channel lying
[01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:25.360]  about what we say that we said that David Dewhurst the CIA operative former
[01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:30.880]  lieutenant governor came out in ABC News and said that the groups criticizing and
[01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:36.120]  my name was in there Jade Helm want to spit on the troops like Vietnam what the
[01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:39.240]  hell the troops don't want to be part of Jade Helm they know it's part of a
[01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:44.760]  conditioning operation you see how they're operating folks and they got the
[01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:49.480]  Republicans working with them on these globalist operations on TPP on all of
[01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:53.240]  it it's here we're being conquered we're being usurped and they don't want to have
[01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:56.920]  a debate about it they want to shut down people who are engaged in legitimate
[01:44:56.920 --> 01:45:03.360]  journalism modern Paul Revere's all of you ride now get the word out and send
[01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:06.840]  people to info wars.com because it's the information they don't want you to be
[01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:11.440]  aware of I'm Alex Jones from the front lines of the info war we now go live to
[01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:16.080]  David Knight from the info wars.com news center in Austin the house that the
[01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:22.320]  people built the house where patriotism and the resistance lives absolutely and
[01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:25.800]  you know when I look at that editorial that David Dewhurst wrote that went into
[01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:31.520]  the Dallas Morning Herald it was absolutely obnoxious the thing started
[01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:35.280]  out with a bunch of pictures of metals and essentially came back and said give
[01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:38.720]  the military the you know carte blanche don't question anything that they have
[01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:43.560]  to say if you do you're not a you hate the military let's talk about who hates
[01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:47.640]  the military it's the VA that has confiscated the guys when you look at
[01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:52.040]  the national background check database 99.3% of the people who've had their
[01:45:52.040 --> 01:45:56.160]  firearms confiscated have been veterans who were turned in by the VA and of
[01:45:56.160 --> 01:45:59.920]  course the veterans are prominently figuring in all of their training
[01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:03.840]  scenarios for domestic operations as veterans people who want constitutional
[01:46:03.840 --> 01:46:07.200]  government people who want limited government not people like lieutenant
[01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:10.760]  governor Dewhurst well they're attacking soldiers in other ways too though while
[01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:13.480]  you're still in the military when you're so active duty whether it be army
[01:46:13.480 --> 01:46:18.840]  Marines or whatever they push all these opiates on you yeah where you pump yeah
[01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:22.920]  but come where you come become addicted to it and then when they kick you out or
[01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:26.800]  you get out and they suggest you get out then when they send you to the VA they
[01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:30.920]  like oh you have a drug problem yeah and then and then next thing you know these
[01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:35.800]  guys end up shooting themselves they go you know it's crazy about the war on
[01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:39.440]  drugs that we're gonna be talking to freeway Ricky Ross is gonna be joining
[01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:42.960]  us live in studio in the next hour and you want to talk about you know we talk
[01:46:42.960 --> 01:46:47.000]  about the war of drugs and the war of terrorism because both of these things
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:50.880]  are being run by our government they're training terrorists they are growing the
[01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:56.360]  poppies in Afghanistan they were running the drugs into LA with the crack cocaine
[01:46:56.360 --> 01:47:01.040]  trade that he was a part of as part of the Iran Contra scandal with Ronald Reagan
[01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:04.520]  when you look at that just think about that who we supposed to be afraid of the
[01:47:04.520 --> 01:47:11.040]  most today supposed to be Iran what did Ronald Reagan do he secretly armed Iran
[01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:14.960]  okay they had a lot of planes they needed parts because we had installed a
[01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:18.280]  puppet there for decades well the battleships that they have now or the
[01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:21.680]  old ones that we gave them yeah yeah we had a ruthless dictatorship that was
[01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:26.920]  set up and trained by the CIA the Savak now in order to get leverage with his
[01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:30.600]  war in South America Reagan sold those people who are supposed to be our
[01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:37.600]  enemies sold them parts and then sold drugs into into California and the rest
[01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:41.240]  of the country at the same time they were telling everybody just say no here's
[01:47:41.240 --> 01:47:44.400]  the drugs but just say no yeah you know we're from the government we're here to
[01:47:44.400 --> 01:47:47.640]  help you we're gonna keep you off of drugs and we're gonna help you get drugs
[01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:51.200]  at the same time so you look at that you look at the Iran Contra there is the
[01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:54.520]  war on terror there's a war on drugs right there in a nutshell and it is a
[01:47:54.520 --> 01:48:00.000]  war of drugs and of terror against the American people by your snatching up
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.640]  Americans left and right throwing them in jail for these little petty crimes
[01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:06.160]  having like an ounce or a little bit I don't even know all the measurements but
[01:48:06.160 --> 01:48:09.640]  like a little bit of marijuana and we're just our prison systems are all
[01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:14.320]  overflowed you know are full because of this war on drugs that they created in
[01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:19.320]  the first place open production went up at 900 times what it was in 2001 when
[01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:22.760]  the Taliban was at its peak of control in Afghanistan there's like 10% of the
[01:48:22.760 --> 01:48:26.720]  world's supply now it's over 90% exactly I mean bigger all the time let's we've
[01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:29.280]  got a clip from Jade Helm and I want to get back to that and I want to get back
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:34.480]  to David Dewhurst and basically look at where this attack is coming from but
[01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:39.600]  let's play this Jade Helm clip from CNN then we'll respond to it by directing
[01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:43.760]  the state guard to monitor the operations will allow don't mess with Texas is
[01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:48.520]  Republican Governor Greg Abbott's message to the Pentagon Abbott called out his
[01:48:48.520 --> 01:48:53.720]  state guard to keep an eye on US special operations forces the governor says he
[01:48:53.720 --> 01:48:58.240]  wants to make sure Texans constitutional rights private property rights and
[01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:03.400]  civil liberties will not be infringed during an upcoming military war game
[01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:11.160]  called Jade Helm 15 1200 personnel Army Green Berets Navy Seals and Air Force
[01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:16.840]  troops will train across seven states this summer do Texans really have to
[01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:22.440]  worry their own freedom is at risk the site infowars has led the internet buzz
[01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:28.560]  insisting it's all a plan for the army to wage war on Americans publishing a
[01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:34.560]  military PowerPoint slide showing Texas as red enemy territory I've hardly ever
[01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:37.520]  heard of something joint like this unless they're actually planning an
[01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:42.000]  invasion Republican presidential candidate Senator Ted Cruz says he
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:47.680]  understands Texans worries I think part of the reason is we have seen for six
[01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:52.640]  years a federal government disrespecting the liberty of the citizens and that
[01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:59.040]  produces fear Chuck Norris one-time Walker Texas Ranger TV actor that kind of
[01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:04.280]  space like that website WorldNet Daily what's under question are those who are
[01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:09.960]  pulling the strings at the top of Jade Helm 15 back in Washington Governor
[01:50:09.960 --> 01:50:14.720]  Abbott now says all he meant to do was have his state militia coordinate with
[01:50:14.720 --> 01:50:20.680]  the Pentagon we have been provided assurances by the special operations
[01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:26.600]  forces that there is nothing for the public to worry about but now
[01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:31.400]  Democrats are calling on Abbott to apologize to the military a former
[01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:38.120]  Texas Republican state lawmaker says the governor went too far and I just as a
[01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:45.080]  patriotic American do not believe that it is appropriate or necessary to use
[01:50:45.080 --> 01:50:49.760]  state resources to spread America didn't want to have any voter ID by the way
[01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:55.440]  in military the White House try to stay out of the governor's fray I have no

[01:54:11.200 --> 01:54:14.920]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight joining me in the studio is
[01:54:14.920 --> 01:54:20.520]  Joe Biggs and we've been talking about Jade Helm we heard the report from CNN
[01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:23.640]  that you just listened to just before the break and of course they took Alex
[01:54:23.640 --> 01:54:27.800]  Jones's comments very brief took them out of context to make it sound like we
[01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:32.200]  thought this is an all-out invasion it was the beginning of martial law that's
[01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:35.320]  not what we said we were concerned about the fact that this is constantly
[01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:41.200]  building that we have these training exercises being conducted in
[01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:46.000]  cities outside of military bases outside of federal land that this is part of
[01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:50.880]  conditioning the American public to living with the military on the streets
[01:54:50.880 --> 01:54:54.200]  like we're some kind of a banana Republic with nuclear weapons when I
[01:54:54.200 --> 01:54:59.560]  talked to the reporter here at K view the ABC affiliate she came back she said
[01:54:59.560 --> 01:55:02.400]  well you know they might have some real legitimate uses for having the military
[01:55:02.400 --> 01:55:06.000]  in the United States maybe they need to protect us from ISIS or from drug dealers
[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:11.280]  I said well maybe then they could put the troops at the border and we've got
[01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:15.920]  this report just came out at the end of yesterday this is something that happened
[01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:20.000]  back in June 26th of last year you said you'd heard of it at the time that it
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:25.600]  happened now judicial watch used a FOIA request to actually get the documents
[01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:31.600]  from DHS and their records detail how Mexican government helicopters cross
[01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:36.840]  the border and fired on border patrol positions there that's the Mexican
[01:55:36.840 --> 01:55:41.080]  government coming across the border in military helicopters and firing up you
[01:55:41.080 --> 01:55:45.760]  but of course we have to have the military to protect us with these drills
[01:55:45.760 --> 01:55:48.020]  they're not going to put them at the border that's the last thing but if
[01:55:48.020 --> 01:55:51.440]  you're Andrew Timorese and you drive over the border they'll tell you in jail
[01:55:51.440 --> 01:55:55.640]  that's right you know that's right yeah yeah that Marine that was picked up for
[01:55:55.640 --> 01:55:58.120]  a long time he got funneled in and I've had this happen to me before with
[01:55:58.120 --> 01:56:01.160]  toll roads get funneled into something they won't let you turn around yeah I
[01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:03.800]  just need to come I need to turn around no you can't you got to come through oh
[01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:08.440]  now you're in you're under arrest yes you're not leaving yeah exactly so we
[01:56:08.440 --> 01:56:11.560]  were talking about what's going on of course there's a full-court press it's
[01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:16.120]  very interesting that it seems like the lead apologist for Jade Helm is a
[01:56:16.120 --> 01:56:19.840]  former lieutenant governor David Dewhurst who ran unsuccessfully against
[01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:23.760]  the current sitting governor so there's a lot of politics involved in this he
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:27.880]  took some swipes at Info Wars but it's not the first time that we've had a
[01:56:27.880 --> 01:56:32.960]  back-and-forth with David Dewhurst if you go back to 2011 Paul Joseph Watson
[01:56:32.960 --> 01:56:36.820]  reported about then lieutenant governor Republican lieutenant governor
[01:56:36.820 --> 01:56:40.960]  killing a TSA bill and again what happened was this is a bill that's put
[01:56:40.960 --> 01:56:46.640]  forth by David Simpson a great libertarian legislator here in Texas it
[01:56:46.640 --> 01:56:53.120]  would have stopped the the manhandling of men women and children by the TSA the
[01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:57.640]  violations of our fourth amendment the violations of just common decency his
[01:56:57.640 --> 01:57:01.480]  bill passed unanimously in the house and then it looked like it was going to
[01:57:01.480 --> 01:57:05.160]  pass in the Senate so people like David Dewhurst got busy with the TSA and
[01:57:05.160 --> 01:57:11.840]  scuttled it that's precisely what Senator Patrick said Dan Patrick he said
[01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:15.760]  Dewhurst came up with this elaborate political play to kill the bill without
[01:57:15.760 --> 01:57:19.200]  his fingerprints but his fingerprints are all over this and Patrick went on to
[01:57:19.200 --> 01:57:22.960]  say someone who will undermine his members someone who will not stand up
[01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:26.880]  to the federal government you have to ask yourself is that the kind of person
[01:57:26.880 --> 01:57:31.440]  we need in the US Senate said Patrick about Dewhurst adding that he had
[01:57:31.440 --> 01:57:36.040]  sideswiped him on Tuesday night by turning members against the bill he says
[01:57:36.040 --> 01:57:38.520]  I hear he's thinking about running for governor I hear he's thinking about
[01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:42.120]  running for senator in the last 24 hours he's given me some things to think
[01:57:42.120 --> 01:57:49.320]  about this is a guy who worked for he's he's portrays himself as a Vietnam vet
[01:57:49.320 --> 01:57:54.240]  and in that disgusting op-ed piece that he put in the Dallas Morning News as
[01:57:54.240 --> 01:57:58.560]  Alex Jones pointed out his report at the bottom of the hour he said that he was
[01:57:58.560 --> 01:58:01.800]  mistreated as a Vietnam vet he doesn't want to see that happening to people
[01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:04.680]  well you know we're concerned about the way the vets are treated and they're
[01:58:04.680 --> 01:58:07.760]  being mistreated by the VA we've talked about that over and over again that's
[01:58:07.760 --> 01:58:11.640]  where the biggest mistreatment of American vets are we're not talking
[01:58:11.640 --> 01:58:15.160]  about mistreating vets we're not talking about mistreating servicemen we're
[01:58:15.160 --> 01:58:20.040]  talking about what is the mission of the United States what is the legitimate
[01:58:20.040 --> 01:58:24.040]  mission of the United States is there not being transparent absolutely well

[02:00:58.760 --> 02:01:04.360]  who has turned his life around and did it under very difficult circumstances and
[02:01:04.360 --> 02:01:08.000]  looking forward to talking to him again we have a story that's up on info
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:13.320]  wars dot com and linked on the drudge report dhs funded spy tag knows when
[02:01:13.320 --> 02:01:16.960]  you visit the bathroom they know everything about you and you know what
[02:01:16.960 --> 02:01:20.520]  these guys like to pretend that they're santa claws they know when you're
[02:01:20.520 --> 02:01:23.240]  sleeping they know when you're awake but and they've got all these wonderful
[02:01:23.240 --> 02:01:28.120]  gifts for us but you know I just don't think it's going to work out that way
[02:01:28.120 --> 02:01:33.080]  I've got my suspicions I guess that just makes me a conspiracy theorist no
[02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:37.640]  actually I'm a skeptic of a government that demands to know everything about you
[02:01:37.640 --> 02:01:41.400]  that wants to track you even when you go to the bathroom but will not tell you
[02:01:41.400 --> 02:01:46.760]  anything about itself passes laws and secret passes trade agreements in secret
[02:01:46.760 --> 02:01:53.600]  has court trials in secret and openly violates all of our guaranteed rights
[02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:58.040]  under the Constitution are God-given rights that are recognized on the
[02:01:58.040 --> 02:02:04.360]  Constitution and now this tyranny that we have seen on display in America that
[02:02:04.360 --> 02:02:08.720]  has paraded itself now openly without anything happening to it even after the
[02:02:08.720 --> 02:02:13.800]  Snowden leaks far after the leaks by William Benny another NSA whistleblowers
[02:02:13.800 --> 02:02:18.760]  now this is metastasizing to other countries yesterday we learned the
[02:02:18.760 --> 02:02:22.760]  French parliament approved new surveillance rules they say the law on
[02:02:22.760 --> 02:02:28.200]  intelligence gathering this is a BBC reporting adopted by 438 votes to 86 was
[02:02:28.200 --> 02:02:32.320]  drafted after three days of attacks in Paris now what are they giving them the
[02:02:32.320 --> 02:02:37.120]  rights to do this sounds very familiar if you're if you know about the American
[02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:40.160]  police state the surveillance state they're going to define purposes for
[02:02:40.160 --> 02:02:43.720]  which secret intelligence gathering may be used they're going to set up a
[02:02:43.720 --> 02:02:47.360]  supervisory body the National Commission for control of intelligence
[02:02:47.360 --> 02:02:51.640]  techniques with wider rules of operations does that sound all familiar you
[02:02:51.640 --> 02:02:54.840]  know they did all of that they called it the foreign intelligence surveillance
[02:02:54.840 --> 02:02:58.920]  act they did that after Frank Church's committee pointed out how our government
[02:02:58.920 --> 02:03:04.600]  was spying on American citizens getting dangerously outside of their mission
[02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:07.800]  turning themselves against the American they were going to protect us against
[02:03:07.800 --> 02:03:13.360]  foreign dangers remember remember what Madison said those things that we do to
[02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:18.000]  protect us from foreign dangers become instruments of tyranny at home like the
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:24.280]  CIA like a standing army this is what eventually happens and so we've seen
[02:03:24.280 --> 02:03:28.200]  this all before we've been there as a matter of fact earlier this week they
[02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:35.760]  had statues of Snowden Assange and Manning unveiled in East Berlin Alexander
[02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:42.240]  plots it's the biggest square in East Berlin it's very famous in East Germany
[02:03:42.240 --> 02:03:47.920]  the home of the Stasi the home of the police state that everybody refers to
[02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:52.560]  the police state that William Benny watched for decades and now William
[02:03:52.560 --> 02:03:58.520]  Benny says we're not this close to a police state it's already here see America
[02:03:58.520 --> 02:04:03.920]  has become the poster child now not East Germany but now it has become America
[02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:09.920]  we have taken on the mantle of the police state the surveillance state so now
[02:04:09.920 --> 02:04:13.080]  you've got people that the American government is after for being whistle
[02:04:13.080 --> 02:04:18.440]  blowers people like Manning Assange Snowden the people who exposed criminal
[02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:23.360]  actions who exposed wrongdoings they're the ones who go to jail we just saw
[02:04:23.360 --> 02:04:28.280]  this this week and the UN went after a man who was part of a human rights
[02:04:28.280 --> 02:04:33.080]  commission talking about how UN troops were molesting children interestingly
[02:04:33.080 --> 02:04:38.640]  enough his name was compass I guess they don't have a moral compass and neither
[02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:44.760]  does America as I said they're erecting statues to remind people of the heroes
[02:04:44.760 --> 02:04:48.720]  that the American government has prosecuted but don't worry Jade Helm
[02:04:48.720 --> 02:04:53.240]  is nothing to worry about that military exercise in your backyard don't worry
[02:04:53.240 --> 02:04:57.320]  about it we'll be right back with freeway Ricky Ross
[02:04:59.080 --> 02:05:05.680]  did you know that only six corporations control 90% of what millions of
[02:05:05.680 --> 02:05:12.000]  Americans see here and read every single day it's the illusion of choice think
[02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:17.000]  about it the mainstream media is owned by only a handful of mega corporations
[02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:21.840]  with vested interests but on the other hand the internet is an interconnected
[02:05:21.840 --> 02:05:27.680]  network of billions of sources so you can research information for yourself from
[02:05:27.680 --> 02:05:32.920]  multiple sources or you can blindly accept what you hear or read in the
[02:05:32.920 --> 02:05:37.320]  mainstream media never questioning what you are being told this gives you a
[02:05:37.320 --> 02:05:42.280]  false sense of reality I mean do you actually know what you think you know or
[02:05:42.280 --> 02:05:47.400]  have you been programmed to accept someone else's version of events think

[02:08:34.600 --> 02:08:40.640]  the movie shoot the messenger and of course Rick Ross features prominently
[02:08:40.640 --> 02:08:46.640]  in that he's recognized by many people as being a pawn in the CIA drug wars and
[02:08:46.640 --> 02:08:51.600]  of course if you look at the Iran Contra scandal as we pointed out it involves
[02:08:51.600 --> 02:08:57.640]  elements of both the war on terror being supposedly helping Iran for money to go
[02:08:57.640 --> 02:09:02.040]  after other gorillas and other parts of the world as well as the war on drugs
[02:09:02.040 --> 02:09:06.720]  they're running both sides of this they're running the war on terror they're
[02:09:06.720 --> 02:09:10.720]  funding the terrorists they're funding the drug organizations the the growing of
[02:09:10.720 --> 02:09:16.440]  the poppies in Afghanistan and of course the cocaine that's coming from South and
[02:09:16.440 --> 02:09:22.320]  Central America and with us today is exhibit a and this is freeway Rick Ross
[02:09:22.320 --> 02:09:26.800]  of course we sell his book here at info wars store.com it is a bestseller on

[02:09:37.800 --> 02:09:43.320]  Amazon it's a top seller welcome thank you for having me now we've seen a lot of
[02:09:43.320 --> 02:09:47.680]  back and forth on the last couple of weeks of course about Baltimore we've
[02:09:47.680 --> 02:09:52.680]  seen Al Sharpton come in and say well you know we need to federalize the police
[02:09:52.680 --> 02:09:59.160]  it's like the police what do you think of that I think that's crazy we have
[02:09:59.160 --> 02:10:04.120]  enough police in already yeah yeah and of course Al Sharpton was an FBI informant
[02:10:04.120 --> 02:10:08.440]  but what he is saying is essentially I would think many of us believe that it
[02:10:08.440 --> 02:10:12.560]  is the federalization of the police and the way the Federals have taught them to
[02:10:12.560 --> 02:10:16.800]  shoot first that is at the heart of this issue I totally agree yeah I think it was
[02:10:16.800 --> 02:10:21.280]  about you grew up in in poor circumstances of course in LA right
[02:10:21.280 --> 02:10:26.920]  absolutely so so talk to us about people's responses to this I mean what
[02:10:26.920 --> 02:10:29.480]  do you think about the looting that's going on there is that appropriate if
[02:10:29.480 --> 02:10:32.320]  not if that's not appropriate what do we do to change it's definitely not
[02:10:32.320 --> 02:10:39.360]  appropriate but you know when when you smash somebody up you know and you
[02:10:39.360 --> 02:10:44.440]  back them in a corner they're gonna come out with the only way that they know
[02:10:44.440 --> 02:10:48.880]  how you know and some of these people that not well educated you know our
[02:10:48.880 --> 02:10:52.840]  education system is is in in the black community is down you know we don't get
[02:10:52.840 --> 02:10:58.600]  the best teachers I feel I mean you know when I go out to these schools and I
[02:10:58.600 --> 02:11:04.760]  speak to a lot of these inner city kids let me tell you this they want to read
[02:11:04.760 --> 02:11:10.440]  my book mm-hmm but do you know the schools won't buy it for them really yeah
[02:11:10.440 --> 02:11:15.000]  something as simple as a as a book that they could get for ten seven dollars well
[02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:19.160]  they got their own agenda okay they have their own agenda it's filled up and
[02:11:19.160 --> 02:11:22.920]  they don't want you going outside of that agenda exactly they don't want the
[02:11:22.920 --> 02:11:27.400]  kids to get the information that the kids wonder oh this is what you get this
[02:11:27.400 --> 02:11:31.400]  is where you stay it's almost like keeping you in your place mm-hmm it's
[02:11:31.400 --> 02:11:34.760]  like another form of slavery all over again where you got to stand your place
[02:11:34.760 --> 02:11:38.240]  and if you step out of your place then you're on your own and we're gonna have
[02:11:38.240 --> 02:11:42.480]  our police force to deal with it and your story is something that people should
[02:11:42.480 --> 02:11:46.080]  hear because just looking at that your biography on Wikipedia in terms of some
[02:11:46.080 --> 02:11:51.560]  of the dollars how big this operation was in an LA look 1980 dollars they say
[02:11:51.560 --> 02:11:56.040]  that you had 900 million dollars with a profit of nearly 300 million and today's
[02:11:56.040 --> 02:11:59.400]  dollars would be two and a half billion dollar gross of that 850 million dollar
[02:11:59.400 --> 02:12:03.320]  profit so I mean it sounds like you were living the life and success right
[02:12:03.320 --> 02:12:07.880]  that everybody is looking for and you talk about a kid mm-hmm that they said
[02:12:07.880 --> 02:12:14.600]  in school was a dummy mm-hmm they had me feeling as if I wasn't gonna make it in
[02:12:14.600 --> 02:12:20.520]  life I had they this the system gave me low self-esteem mm-hmm because I wasn't
[02:12:20.520 --> 02:12:26.520]  functioning in the way that they felt that I should be functioning and and that
[02:12:26.520 --> 02:12:31.840]  made me lash out that made me look for ways that I could be successful it made
[02:12:31.840 --> 02:12:36.600]  me go and start hanging out with with gangsters and and and and people that
[02:12:36.600 --> 02:12:41.760]  that would accept me because if if the mainstream society don't accept you you
[02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:46.520]  want to be accepted by somebody and so your story is something really that
[02:12:46.520 --> 02:12:51.000]  inner-city kids ought to look at because here you are offered what they would all
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:55.400]  dream of a pinnacle of success and yet it was a Faustian bargain with the devil
[02:12:55.400 --> 02:12:59.640]  the government absolutely okay the government you didn't know it at the
[02:12:59.640 --> 02:13:03.880]  time but you had made a deal with the the devil himself absolutely and after a
[02:13:03.880 --> 02:13:08.120]  few years of this success it came back to bite you with a life
[02:13:08.120 --> 02:13:12.960]  prisonment okay imprisonment without the possibility parole yeah yeah so I mean
[02:13:12.960 --> 02:13:16.480]  that that is amazing and then you turned your life or what turns your life and
[02:13:16.480 --> 02:13:20.920]  that's not even the most amazing part of it after I got the life sentence I was
[02:13:20.920 --> 02:13:27.680]  totally illiterate this dumb kid that couldn't succeed in school wind up
[02:13:27.680 --> 02:13:34.040]  being smarter in the courtroom than a Harvard graduate a Yale graduate and the
[02:13:34.040 --> 02:13:40.880]  top judge because once I taught myself to read or write in prison I explained
[02:13:40.880 --> 02:13:44.240]  to them why they couldn't give me a life sentence and why them giving me a
[02:13:44.240 --> 02:13:49.000]  life sentence was illegal was against their own books and and and they didn't
[02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:54.160]  understand that it reminds me of the New Jersey weed man who had like a pound of
[02:13:54.160 --> 02:13:58.960]  marijuana and he was a medical marijuana advocate and they picked him up and
[02:13:58.960 --> 02:14:01.840]  because the quantity they were going to put him in jail for trafficking and he
[02:14:01.840 --> 02:14:04.520]  said well you know I don't really think I'm gonna get much defense from a
[02:14:04.520 --> 02:14:08.320]  legit you know a regular lawyer so he looked at he said you know most of the
[02:14:08.320 --> 02:14:12.720]  people don't agree with our laws on marijuana they think they're draconian
[02:14:12.720 --> 02:14:17.080]  and out of the line so he goes all I have to do is get one person out of 12
[02:14:17.080 --> 02:14:21.880]  it's like 8% right and he knows that like 50 to 60% of the people some cases
[02:14:21.880 --> 02:14:25.760]  higher disagreed with the laws of that time about two years ago so he defended
[02:14:25.760 --> 02:14:29.640]  himself and he used jury nullification well the first judge says you can't
[02:14:29.640 --> 02:14:33.880]  tell them about the law you know and that's exactly exactly and contempt but
[02:14:33.880 --> 02:14:36.720]  he still got seven people to vote for acquittal they came after him a second
[02:14:36.720 --> 02:14:42.440]  time that judge let him put up the the law right out of New Jersey okay with
[02:14:42.440 --> 02:14:46.520]  that show that they have juries have the right to judge the facts of the case not
[02:14:46.520 --> 02:14:50.320]  just the law rather and not just the facts I'll tell you you've got to just
[02:14:50.320 --> 02:14:53.200]  judge the facts don't don't consider whether you agree with the law or whatever
[02:14:53.200 --> 02:14:56.800]  no that's your that's your duty and you're right as a juror so when they left
[02:14:56.800 --> 02:15:00.120]  that up he got completely quitted 12 they want to take that away from us yes
[02:15:00.120 --> 02:15:03.360]  that's why it's so important you know that that that you guys here at info
[02:15:03.360 --> 02:15:07.480]  war continue to do your work because we have to wake the people up and let the
[02:15:07.480 --> 02:15:13.280]  people know that you are in charge you know Obama's not in charge none of these
[02:15:13.280 --> 02:15:17.280]  politicians are really in charge unless and we give them their power we give them
[02:15:17.280 --> 02:15:21.720]  all the power that they have and they're supposed to be doing exactly what we
[02:15:21.720 --> 02:15:27.760]  tell them to do not the agenda that some big corporation who's lacing their
[02:15:27.760 --> 02:15:30.800]  pocketbooks are telling them what to do you know what would you tell the people
[02:15:30.800 --> 02:15:34.640]  and in Baltimore the young guys in Baltimore you know obviously they're
[02:15:34.640 --> 02:15:38.280]  frustrated I'm frustrated I mean it's not just black people you know I'm hoping
[02:15:38.280 --> 02:15:42.760]  that I'll be going there pretty soon to give a lecture to them and and just
[02:15:42.760 --> 02:15:46.920]  right off the top I would tell them that violence is not the way you can't beat
[02:15:46.920 --> 02:15:50.440]  these people with guns because they've taken away all the guns from from the
[02:15:50.440 --> 02:15:54.960]  citizens yes they have the most powerful weapons in the world and they have no
[02:15:54.960 --> 02:15:59.160]  problem with shooting you mm-hmm and as we see and it's going to be justified you
[02:15:59.160 --> 02:16:02.280]  know we see over and over again for have to say that they were afraid for their
[02:16:02.280 --> 02:16:08.040]  life even myself you know I was shot at running from the scene why I had
[02:16:08.040 --> 02:16:11.880]  committed no crime that day you know I had been selling drugs before but that
[02:16:11.880 --> 02:16:15.360]  particular day I absolutely had no guns they shot at me three times still
[02:16:15.360 --> 02:16:19.920]  unless you are actually a threat to the life of the officer the safety of the
[02:16:19.920 --> 02:16:23.680]  officer unless you're running at him or unless you're pointing a gun at him if
[02:16:23.680 --> 02:16:28.000]  you're running away from him unarmed they should not be allowed to shoot you in
[02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:31.080]  the back I've taken concealed carry classes and I understand what the law is
[02:16:31.080 --> 02:16:34.360]  for me as a citizen when no one is threatening me if somebody breaks into
[02:16:34.360 --> 02:16:37.760]  my house I say I've got a gun and they turn around they start running away and
[02:16:37.760 --> 02:16:41.960]  I shoot him on my front lawn I'm gonna go to jail for manslaughter at the very
[02:16:41.960 --> 02:16:45.960]  least I agree I agree I totally agree but I'm telling you out of from experience
[02:16:45.960 --> 02:16:50.880]  mm-hmm you've been there I've been shot at from running away from a scene and
[02:16:50.880 --> 02:16:54.840]  not because I committed a crime only because I've been threatened by the
[02:16:54.840 --> 02:16:58.240]  police that they had told my friends that they were gonna kill me I've also
[02:16:58.240 --> 02:17:04.080]  been handcuffed after I surrendered got on all my knees put my hands on top of
[02:17:04.080 --> 02:17:10.160]  my head like this here they cuffed me and went to assault me these scars in my
[02:17:10.160 --> 02:17:14.520]  head is from police brutality while I was handcuffed and I hadn't put up any
[02:17:14.520 --> 02:17:18.480]  any struggle until after you know once they started hitting you so much you
[02:17:18.480 --> 02:17:24.000]  that the pain gets so what's the word for it it gets so well you can't tolerate
[02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:28.920]  anymore that you start to to fight in and move to so you don't get hit here
[02:17:28.920 --> 02:17:32.120]  again you brother get hit back here it's just natural so you try to protect
[02:17:32.120 --> 02:17:35.600]  yourself right you're flinching and then they say you're struggling exactly yeah
[02:17:35.600 --> 02:17:40.880]  yeah exactly so what would you tell them to do what you would advise that they
[02:17:40.880 --> 02:17:45.840]  that they act as a Martin Luther King told them in a demonstration rather
[02:17:45.840 --> 02:17:49.360]  than a riot we've got that clip that Darren McBrain put together this is a
[02:17:49.360 --> 02:17:53.280]  demonstration this is a riot if you can't tell the difference no no we got
[02:17:53.280 --> 02:17:57.160]  to do is we got to become educated you know we got to start getting the
[02:17:57.160 --> 02:18:01.240]  information just like what you guys hear them for war doing and I'm so glad
[02:18:01.240 --> 02:18:05.720]  that that I became exposed in for wars at the time that I did and got educated
[02:18:05.720 --> 02:18:09.560]  you know and start to learn that if we think for ourselves then we can do
[02:18:09.560 --> 02:18:15.080]  better but when you don't know a lot of times you think you're fighting and you
[02:18:15.080 --> 02:18:18.720]  really plan right into the system's hands you know you go out and you shoot
[02:18:18.720 --> 02:18:23.040]  a police officer to sit in a car who who had did nothing to nobody then that
[02:18:23.040 --> 02:18:29.080]  feeds into this brutal dangerous justifies it justifies it exactly in
[02:18:29.080 --> 02:18:33.240]  their mind that yeah we're doing the right things so that's definitely not
[02:18:33.240 --> 02:18:37.800]  the right things to do and and burning up buildings is not gonna fix anything
[02:18:37.800 --> 02:18:40.720]  is just gonna tear up our neighborhoods what we have to do is we have to sit
[02:18:40.720 --> 02:18:47.200]  down and come up with strategies and techniques to educate ourselves and and
[02:18:47.200 --> 02:18:52.920]  put the people in power that's gonna help us let me ask you this because the
[02:18:52.920 --> 02:18:56.360]  thing that concerns me when I see Al Sharpton get involved in others is they
[02:18:56.360 --> 02:19:00.880]  always turn this into something that is simply racial I say this is simply
[02:19:00.880 --> 02:19:04.640]  against the black people and of course it is much higher in the black communities
[02:19:04.640 --> 02:19:09.360]  no doubt about it but when I look at this what I see is a beta test for all
[02:19:09.360 --> 02:19:13.800]  of us because the the violence that is going on now even though it is higher we
[02:19:13.800 --> 02:19:19.200]  see increased levels of violence against all people white people pregnant women
[02:19:19.200 --> 02:19:23.600]  white pregnant women whatever I mean it that what has changed is the way the
[02:19:23.600 --> 02:19:28.320]  police react and are justified by the system in reacting to the public and
[02:19:28.320 --> 02:19:31.520]  that's what really needs and we need to come together instead of saying well
[02:19:31.520 --> 02:19:35.680]  this is a black problem when they say that that basically pushes the white
[02:19:35.680 --> 02:19:38.200]  people off the side we got to come up with a break I want to get your answer
[02:19:38.200 --> 02:19:41.520]  to that when we come back how do we unify together get everybody to
[02:19:41.520 --> 02:19:44.440]  understand that this is all of our problems we have a problem with the
[02:19:44.440 --> 02:19:47.720]  police state we have a problem with the surveillance state we all need to come
[02:19:47.720 --> 02:19:52.720]  together regardless of color and fight this common tyranny we'll be right back

[02:24:15.360 --> 02:24:20.440]  Ricky Ross he is on a book tour promoting his book freeway Rick Ross the
[02:24:20.440 --> 02:24:25.480]  untold autobiography we saw here at info wars.com and it is a top seller at
[02:24:25.480 --> 02:24:30.440]  Amazon as well it's a an interesting read it's something that we're pointing
[02:24:30.440 --> 02:24:36.160]  out really ought to be read by a lot of a lot of kids in school absolutely who are
[02:24:36.160 --> 02:24:39.760]  very poor and think that maybe the way they can get out of this is with the
[02:24:39.760 --> 02:24:44.920]  war on drugs but it is a trap that has been set up by the government and we're
[02:24:44.920 --> 02:24:49.920]  going to talk about the government's involvement in the crack cocaine business
[02:24:49.920 --> 02:24:53.320]  as well as the Iran Contra here because that was all part of it that
[02:24:53.320 --> 02:24:57.720]  essentially brings these two justifications for our police state
[02:24:57.720 --> 02:25:01.680]  for our surveillance state the war on drugs the war against terrorism they
[02:25:01.680 --> 02:25:05.840]  say brings that into perspective because you can see in the Iran Contra
[02:25:05.840 --> 02:25:09.640]  scandals that the government was running both sides of both of those wars as
[02:25:09.640 --> 02:25:13.400]  they continue to do today Rick before we go back to this I want to let you know

[02:25:50.800 --> 02:25:55.480]  got what is defyventures.org well it was it was funny this company
[02:25:55.480 --> 02:26:00.920]  contacted me about about three months ago and they told me that they were
[02:26:00.920 --> 02:26:07.000]  interested in helping guys who had went to prison and got out help them get on
[02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:12.520]  their feet by giving them training and helping them get loans to start
[02:26:12.520 --> 02:26:16.680]  businesses and they said that they had pretty good luck because one of the
[02:26:16.680 --> 02:26:21.200]  things they find out with drug dealers is that they had a Tennessee to stay with
[02:26:21.200 --> 02:26:25.720]  their business they didn't start something and quit so they're the company
[02:26:25.720 --> 02:26:30.360]  it's a big kind of entrepreneurs to start with right yeah so as a company
[02:26:30.360 --> 02:26:33.680]  that came up with the idea that if we start to help these guys start
[02:26:33.680 --> 02:26:37.920]  businesses they won't go back to prison that's great so that's one of the
[02:26:37.920 --> 02:26:41.920]  companies that that contacted me and I'm working with them now and of course
[02:26:41.920 --> 02:26:47.920]  your other websites are freewayrick.com and I am the realrickross.com yeah
[02:26:47.920 --> 02:26:50.960]  alright so you can go there you can find out about both of those that's very
[02:26:50.960 --> 02:26:53.480]  important too somebody coming out of prison they want to get their life back
[02:26:53.480 --> 02:26:57.520]  together they'd like to go straight they probably have got some organizational
[02:26:57.520 --> 02:27:01.440]  skills if they were successful what they were doing and that's one of the
[02:27:01.440 --> 02:27:05.200]  biggest things they need just need a hand yeah you know day you get out of
[02:27:05.200 --> 02:27:11.280]  prison and I'm fortunate that I had a few people to help me beside my family
[02:27:11.280 --> 02:27:16.880]  was my family was was in real bad shape when I got home you know themselves you
[02:27:16.880 --> 02:27:20.160]  know if you see the documentary you'll see a couple months after I was out of
[02:27:20.160 --> 02:27:25.200]  prison my mom got kicked out of her house behind remember the markets the
[02:27:25.200 --> 02:27:29.520]  market scandal that went on where they was going out my mom is 85 years old and
[02:27:29.520 --> 02:27:33.880]  they came to her about a loan and loan her $400,000 and she was like I never
[02:27:33.880 --> 02:27:39.560]  got $400,000 but anyway yeah the banker scams that's that's part of
[02:27:39.560 --> 02:27:42.840]  course they're running an even bigger scam right now that's this trade
[02:27:42.840 --> 02:27:45.160]  partnership where they're basically going to take everything from everybody
[02:27:45.160 --> 02:27:48.240]  across the world but we've been talking about how they're negotiating that is
[02:27:48.240 --> 02:27:52.840]  secret when you look at this and you look at the impact of the war on drugs
[02:27:52.840 --> 02:27:56.000]  and of course one of the biggest things about that is breaking up families
[02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:59.440]  destroying families with these mandatory minimums for people who are
[02:27:59.440 --> 02:28:03.960]  nonviolent offenders I mean the presence full of us exactly you were a big
[02:28:03.960 --> 02:28:06.880]  time dealer and as we point out before you know you had in today's dollars
[02:28:06.880 --> 02:28:11.360]  maybe no violence not not an ounce of violence in my am I the only violence I
[02:28:11.360 --> 02:28:15.480]  had that they say I had was when the police had beat me up and handcuffed me
[02:28:15.480 --> 02:28:21.040]  and shot at me and then they said well he did all this and that's why we did
[02:28:21.040 --> 02:28:24.720]  what we did to him yeah yeah but other than that if you look at my arrest record
[02:28:24.720 --> 02:28:30.640]  there's absolutely no violence in my in my jacket at all the rest of my suspected
[02:28:30.640 --> 02:28:35.240]  crimes or all drugs yes and one of the things that I have a problem with is at
[02:28:35.240 --> 02:28:38.760]  the same time that they created the civil asset forfeiture laws which said
[02:28:38.760 --> 02:28:42.080]  that they which now they're using to just steal property from people left and
[02:28:42.080 --> 02:28:45.640]  right at the same time they did that they did the mandatory minimums taking
[02:28:45.640 --> 02:28:49.000]  away somebody could have been a first-time offender maybe they were
[02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:53.120]  growing marijuana in their closet for just small marijuana yeah and and because
[02:28:53.120 --> 02:28:57.080]  the quantity okay it was a federal mandate about how long they would have
[02:28:57.080 --> 02:29:00.520]  to go to prison and they were locking people who are nonviolent up in prison
[02:29:00.520 --> 02:29:04.080]  for such long periods of time we had said so much prison overcrowding that
[02:29:04.080 --> 02:29:07.120]  they were letting violent people out that was the thing that really concerned
[02:29:07.120 --> 02:29:10.320]  me 20 years ago you know I wasn't in the drug trade I wasn't using drugs but I
[02:29:10.320 --> 02:29:13.640]  was like you're letting violent people out well you know I saw a documentary on
[02:29:13.640 --> 02:29:16.720]  life now that you mentioned I saw a documentary on it where this guy was a
[02:29:16.720 --> 02:29:22.640]  homicide detective mm-hmm right smart guy but he said he stopped doing
[02:29:22.640 --> 02:29:27.760]  homicide because he could get better raises and higher promotions by going
[02:29:27.760 --> 02:29:32.240]  out looking for drug dealers absolutely that's where the focus was that's they
[02:29:32.240 --> 02:29:35.200]  focused everything on that because that was what was going to give them power
[02:29:35.200 --> 02:29:38.360]  stay with us we're going to be right back with freeway Rick Ross we're going to
[02:29:38.360 --> 02:29:41.600]  talk about his experiences in prison something that's going on right now in
[02:29:41.600 --> 02:29:44.920]  the corporate prisons you won't believe but we're also going to talk about the
[02:29:44.920 --> 02:29:50.680]  Iran Contra situation stay with us we'll be right back we're on the march the
[02:29:50.680 --> 02:29:57.800]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[02:29:57.800 --> 02:30:04.200]  the big problem with renewable energy like solar and wind is that it varies
[02:30:04.200 --> 02:30:07.920]  widely in output and there's no effective way to store the energy for
[02:30:07.920 --> 02:30:12.400]  ready availability that's why Elon Musk's Tesla has generated so much buzz
[02:30:12.400 --> 02:30:16.640]  about their powerwall battery system while the total cost of powerwall is
[02:30:16.640 --> 02:30:20.240]  still about three times the cost of power from the grid if it can achieve an
[02:30:20.240 --> 02:30:25.000]  economy of scale with large commercial users it could radically change power and
[02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:29.040]  allow people to get off the grid but another technology from Audi may be
[02:30:29.040 --> 02:30:33.400]  even far more disruptive Audi has refined a process from the 1920s that
[02:30:33.400 --> 02:30:37.640]  allows them to use renewable energy like solar to create a clean synthetic
[02:30:37.640 --> 02:30:43.520]  diesel fuel from water and co2 they say it has no sulfur and burns cleanly but
[02:30:43.520 --> 02:30:48.040]  what I like most about it is that it consumes co2 the boogeyman of the
[02:30:48.040 --> 02:30:53.640]  climate alarmists and at short circuits the schemes of carbon pimps like Al Gore

[02:33:23.560 --> 02:33:28.320]  freeway Ricky Ross he's on a book tour promoting his book freeway Rick Ross the

[02:33:38.240 --> 02:33:41.560]  because this is an important book for people to read as we mentioned before
[02:33:41.560 --> 02:33:46.120]  the government came to you one of the things that is that is very important
[02:33:46.120 --> 02:33:48.880]  about your story we're gonna talk about that in this segment of course is the
[02:33:48.880 --> 02:33:53.520]  involvement of the American government in setting up the crack cocaine trade
[02:33:53.520 --> 02:33:56.800]  there that you were part of you didn't know that you're working not for the
[02:33:56.800 --> 02:34:01.400]  CIA and even when it came out you know when Gary first broke the story I still
[02:34:01.400 --> 02:34:06.280]  didn't believe it yeah yeah me or scary web and if you've seen the movie with
[02:34:06.280 --> 02:34:09.960]  Jeremy Renner killed the messenger I think I said it was shoot the message
[02:34:09.960 --> 02:34:15.000]  earlier it's kill the messenger a very very good movie they kind of leave it a
[02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:18.240]  little bit open there at the end they imply that he committed suicide we don't
[02:34:18.240 --> 02:34:21.360]  believe that he committed suicide we can talk to you about that but I want to
[02:34:21.360 --> 02:34:25.160]  before we go to that I want to talk a little bit about prison some of the
[02:34:25.160 --> 02:34:29.760]  things that are going on in prison there's this article from the electronic
[02:34:29.760 --> 02:34:33.160]  frontier Foundation course they get involved in defending digital rights
[02:34:33.160 --> 02:34:36.920]  and they're talking about talking about the corporations that run the prisons
[02:34:36.920 --> 02:34:40.040]  and that's a lot of what's driving this war on drugs absolutely okay there's a
[02:34:40.040 --> 02:34:43.520]  lot of profit and locking everybody up and keeping them in with the mandatory
[02:34:43.520 --> 02:34:48.600]  minimums it's absolutely that is a real crime what they're doing no question
[02:34:48.600 --> 02:34:52.280]  about it that is a real criminal operation there you're taking advantage of
[02:34:52.280 --> 02:34:59.080]  the people who who are less capable of having anything you know you take a guy
[02:34:59.080 --> 02:35:04.080]  you put him in prison and then his phone call is 25 cent a minute to talk on the
[02:35:04.080 --> 02:35:08.680]  telephone to talk to his family who are saving instance me I was in Texas
[02:35:08.680 --> 02:35:12.960]  Canada my family was in California 25 cents a minute and they charge me 25
[02:35:12.960 --> 02:35:15.960]  cents a minute to talk on the phone to my kids and I you know when I went to
[02:35:15.960 --> 02:35:21.120]  prison I had five kids wow wow that's amazing well it's getting worse because
[02:35:21.120 --> 02:35:25.840]  now they've got this company called I called JP they say they want to be the
[02:35:25.840 --> 02:35:29.960]  apple of the prison system okay that's the way they're gonna make when you are
[02:35:29.960 --> 02:35:34.480]  yeah they're gonna give you they say there's an extra charge it's not gonna
[02:35:34.480 --> 02:35:38.160]  show up on your credit card but it's the fact that you're surrendering to them
[02:35:38.160 --> 02:35:42.680]  your rights to letters to pictures to video to any form of creative expression
[02:35:42.680 --> 02:35:47.160]  that's the user terms of contracts that you have to sign with these people who
[02:35:47.160 --> 02:35:51.280]  are going to be running the prison email and phone systems there they say you
[02:35:51.280 --> 02:35:55.560]  acknowledge that J pay owns all the content including any text data
[02:35:55.560 --> 02:36:00.400]  information images or other material that you transmit through the service so
[02:36:00.400 --> 02:36:04.560]  for instance if you wrote a poem and you send it to your mom okay they own that
[02:36:04.560 --> 02:36:08.200]  so you can publish wow but listen to the way that they applied this right they
[02:36:08.200 --> 02:36:12.760]  had person Valerie Buford was running an internet campaign to get her brother
[02:36:12.760 --> 02:36:16.840]  Leon Benson's murder conviction overturned in August of last year she
[02:36:16.840 --> 02:36:21.640]  used J pay to record a 30 second video gram thinking his supporters asking them
[02:36:21.640 --> 02:36:25.520]  to attend an upcoming hearing in his appeal he posted it to Facebook when
[02:36:25.520 --> 02:36:29.800]  the prison staff saw it his access was suspended and according to the Indian
[02:36:29.800 --> 02:36:35.440]  Indianapolis star he was disciplined sent to solitary confinement and stripped
[02:36:35.440 --> 02:36:40.080]  of good time days why because his sister had put a video up asking people to
[02:36:40.080 --> 02:36:44.080]  support his hearing to justify the discipline they said it was because they
[02:36:44.080 --> 02:36:48.520]  were enforcing J pays intellectual property rights yeah so they put him in
[02:36:48.520 --> 02:36:51.960]  solitary confinement to support I've been through that too before while I was
[02:36:51.960 --> 02:36:57.360]  there and not not on the internet but over the telephone if you say some over
[02:36:57.360 --> 02:37:01.240]  the telephone or do some over the telephone that they don't approve you
[02:37:01.240 --> 02:37:04.360]  know we used to have what they had what they call freedom to talk to the press
[02:37:04.360 --> 02:37:10.200]  yeah well they've taken that after 9 11 they took away our freedom to speech
[02:37:10.200 --> 02:37:15.400]  where the news can't come down a lesson award no case it so I know exactly what
[02:37:15.400 --> 02:37:19.160]  they're talking about we did interviews about brown who is a political prisoner
[02:37:19.160 --> 02:37:23.600]  in my opinion up in Dallas we did a phone interview with him we were in
[02:37:23.600 --> 02:37:27.920]  correspondence with him with email and they subsequently took down his email
[02:37:27.920 --> 02:37:31.400]  took down several the other political prisoners that were there as well we
[02:37:31.400 --> 02:37:35.080]  know Alex tried to come and see me and text our camera and they said no way hmm
[02:37:35.080 --> 02:37:41.200]  when let him in so I'm totally familiar with with that system I mean it's
[02:37:41.200 --> 02:37:44.920]  it's really crazy you know that that you would strip I mean it's one thing the
[02:37:44.920 --> 02:37:51.000]  judge sentenced you to prison to do time but it's a whole another thing when
[02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:55.400]  they strip you from your family strip you from the ability to correspond with
[02:37:55.400 --> 02:37:59.840]  the world I mean everybody should have the right to go on Facebook and plead
[02:37:59.840 --> 02:38:03.880]  their innocence even if you guilty maybe that's right even if you guilty you
[02:38:03.880 --> 02:38:09.400]  still should have a right to to to say your side of the story you know and I
[02:38:09.400 --> 02:38:15.360]  don't think that it was ever meant our forefathers when they gave us the freedom
[02:38:15.360 --> 02:38:20.240]  of speech that somebody should strip your rights even if a jury say you are
[02:38:20.240 --> 02:38:24.200]  guilty mm-hmm but if you still send cuz you know we have plenty of people now
[02:38:24.200 --> 02:38:29.600]  that's been we still have a right to appeal right and DNA has proved that
[02:38:29.600 --> 02:38:33.560]  we've had people wrong that was on death row oh absolutely so just because 12
[02:38:33.560 --> 02:38:36.960]  people said that he's guilty doesn't mean that he is guilty you know somebody
[02:38:36.960 --> 02:38:40.960]  may see something on his Facebook or whatever it is and say you know what I
[02:38:40.960 --> 02:38:45.160]  don't believe that he's guilty and I want to help this guy absolutely and we
[02:38:45.160 --> 02:38:48.800]  talked about the fact that that the business that the CIA set you up and
[02:38:48.800 --> 02:38:51.280]  of course you didn't know that you were dealing with a CIA at the time that was
[02:38:51.280 --> 02:38:55.240]  discovered by what I believe it yeah Jerry put it out Jerry Webb the
[02:38:55.240 --> 02:39:00.200]  journalist at a series Dark Alliance it was in the Mercury San Jose press if I
[02:39:00.200 --> 02:39:05.560]  remember the paper correctly correct and and first everybody celebrated until
[02:39:05.560 --> 02:39:08.720]  the government came in I was one of those guys be like I don't believe in
[02:39:08.720 --> 02:39:15.920]  conspiracies yeah yeah you are at the heart of it and you didn't know I mean
[02:39:15.920 --> 02:39:20.280]  how could I believe that I was involved with the CIA yeah I'm the guy that they
[02:39:20.280 --> 02:39:23.600]  hunt that they supposed to be putting in prison so now you're telling me that I've
[02:39:23.600 --> 02:39:27.600]  been selling their drugs I mean even see this is why when we talk about
[02:39:27.600 --> 02:39:30.800]  false flag attacks or whatever people who are first responders people who are
[02:39:30.800 --> 02:39:36.480]  there at the scene they don't have the full picture they've been compartmentalized
[02:39:36.480 --> 02:39:41.000]  so here you are you're running this massive retail organization for the
[02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:45.320]  hotel wholesale supplies coming from the CIA so they can then turn around and
[02:39:45.320 --> 02:39:50.760]  fund their Contra war against the Sandinistas and Nicaragua and you don't
[02:39:50.760 --> 02:39:53.040]  know about it because you're compartmentalized yeah and you don't
[02:39:53.040 --> 02:39:55.880]  believe that it's going to just think it's a conspiracy you know when I started
[02:39:55.880 --> 02:40:00.640]  to believe it well the CIA headed the CIA come down to my cell they interviewed
[02:40:00.640 --> 02:40:06.680]  me and then about six months later they do they report and they say Gary was
[02:40:06.680 --> 02:40:14.560]  right you mean to tell me I mean that's when it really hit me that cuz even the
[02:40:14.560 --> 02:40:18.600]  CIA is compartmentalized there's that you know not everybody and even every
[02:40:18.600 --> 02:40:22.120]  organization knows what's going on yeah some people know what there's good guys
[02:40:22.120 --> 02:40:25.200]  in each organization and there's bad guys in each organization and when they
[02:40:25.200 --> 02:40:29.440]  keep everything secretive in the name of national security that's when they can
[02:40:29.440 --> 02:40:32.800]  get as easy to do stuff you know I think it's interesting you know Ronald Reagan
[02:40:32.800 --> 02:40:35.680]  said you know the nine most terrifying words in English language arm from the
[02:40:35.680 --> 02:40:38.720]  government I'm here to help you throughout the 80s we heard the
[02:40:38.720 --> 02:40:42.720]  government say we're gonna keep you off of drugs just say no but at the same
[02:40:42.720 --> 02:40:47.720]  time Ronald Reagan and Ollie North and they're helping you to sell the drugs
[02:40:47.720 --> 02:40:50.920]  okay hi I'm from the government I'm here to help you set up a crack cocaine
[02:40:50.920 --> 02:40:55.240]  operation right it's what they're doing it's really weird and scary yeah at the
[02:40:55.240 --> 02:41:01.400]  same time you know the thing that all these years I thought that I was
[02:41:01.400 --> 02:41:06.160]  anti-government and doing something against the system and then I was
[02:41:06.160 --> 02:41:11.000]  actually helping the system and you know and now that you see so many young
[02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:16.360]  black men in prison and just Americans in prison you know we have 600,000 black
[02:41:16.360 --> 02:41:21.600]  men in prison for nonviolent offenses and then we have another probably five or
[02:41:21.600 --> 02:41:26.280]  600,000 just citizens of this country that are in jail for nonviolent drug
[02:41:26.280 --> 02:41:30.080]  offenses you're talking about some billions that that we have just sitting
[02:41:30.080 --> 02:41:33.920]  near what they're just warehousing people a lot of money and all these
[02:41:33.920 --> 02:41:38.720]  Republicans who say the government people off of drugs by force you know
[02:41:38.720 --> 02:41:42.520]  get realized that you people are the ones who are getting the bill but they
[02:41:42.520 --> 02:41:46.320]  rebelled they rebelled in prison when you put when you put somebody in jail for
[02:41:46.320 --> 02:41:50.640]  using drugs most I want to rebelle you know because they felt that they had
[02:41:50.640 --> 02:41:54.720]  the right to use drugs if they want to you know people feel like you know if I
[02:41:54.720 --> 02:41:57.400]  want to get drunk if I want to drink alcohol on a smoke cigarettes I had a
[02:41:57.400 --> 02:42:01.320]  right to do that to myself if I'm not hurting anybody else and and it's hard
[02:42:01.320 --> 02:42:06.640]  for anybody to argue with I feel that it should be hard for anybody to argue
[02:42:06.640 --> 02:42:11.020]  with somebody who uses drugs and don't hurt anybody else yeah it's the
[02:42:11.020 --> 02:42:15.280]  difference between a vice and a crime exactly something as Lysander Spooner
[02:42:15.280 --> 02:42:19.240]  pointed out in the 1800s he said vice is something you do that harms yourself a
[02:42:19.240 --> 02:42:22.720]  crime is something that you do that harms other people and if we but of
[02:42:22.720 --> 02:42:27.200]  course we understand that this is to push the government's agendas they have
[02:42:27.200 --> 02:42:30.640]  every one of the things that we're seeing now come to fruition all the
[02:42:30.640 --> 02:42:34.800]  internet surveillance all the collection of your information all the loss of your
[02:42:34.800 --> 02:42:38.600]  due process the government just being able to steal property without even
[02:42:38.600 --> 02:42:42.520]  charging people to crime all of this stuff started with the war on drugs it's
[02:42:42.520 --> 02:42:46.520]  getting worse with the war on terror but it all starts and you know what a neat
[02:42:46.520 --> 02:42:49.200]  search wants to search you you know what they could just go through your bags
[02:42:49.200 --> 02:42:52.240]  and go through your car you know they could just pull you over now on the
[02:42:52.240 --> 02:42:55.800]  highway and just go through your car you know back in old days they couldn't do
[02:42:55.800 --> 02:42:59.400]  that and you know none of this is changing because we look at Afghanistan
[02:42:59.400 --> 02:43:03.920]  and as we were talking during the break they had under the Taliban before the
[02:43:03.920 --> 02:43:07.120]  US government went in there they were only supplying about 10% of the world's
[02:43:07.120 --> 02:43:12.840]  population of opium okay and opium products now it's well over 90% and
[02:43:12.840 --> 02:43:16.040]  every year they've got a bumper crop listen to this article that just came
[02:43:16.040 --> 02:43:20.800]  out from AP says this is an Afghanistan they say the crack cash crop of the
[02:43:20.800 --> 02:43:26.400]  Taliban in the scourge of Afghanistan is the country's intractable opium
[02:43:26.400 --> 02:43:31.040]  cultivation this year many Afghan poppy farmers are expecting a windfall as they
[02:43:31.040 --> 02:43:35.840]  get ready to harvest opium from a new variety of poppy seeds huh okay now
[02:43:35.840 --> 02:43:39.560]  here's how they describe it the plants grow bigger faster use less water than
[02:43:39.560 --> 02:43:44.120]  seeds they've used before and they give double the yield of opium and here's
[02:43:44.120 --> 02:43:51.320]  the kicker right they say no one seems to know where the seeds come from a big
[02:43:51.320 --> 02:43:56.720]  ag lab or something they got a lab over in Afghanistan right that's right I mean
[02:43:56.720 --> 02:43:59.600]  here we are you know this looks like something that's being refined of course
[02:43:59.600 --> 02:44:03.320]  it could be done by some body that's not connected with the American government
[02:44:03.320 --> 02:44:07.360]  but nevertheless we've seen troops guarding the fields we've had Geraldo
[02:44:07.360 --> 02:44:11.400]  Rivera point that out we've played that clip over and over again and we know
[02:44:11.400 --> 02:44:16.920]  what's happened there they have gone from a very small portion of opium to
[02:44:16.920 --> 02:44:22.120]  virtually all and heroin is growing in inner cities again yeah you got a
[02:44:22.120 --> 02:44:26.280]  heroin epidemic just like young kids are using heroin again I mean you know
[02:44:26.280 --> 02:44:30.840]  back in the days nobody would use heroin because they all was educated on it
[02:44:30.840 --> 02:44:34.600]  but people stop educating them on heroin and start educating them on crack and
[02:44:34.600 --> 02:44:38.160]  our crack is down and heroin is climbing yeah they're gonna come up with
[02:44:38.160 --> 02:44:43.000]  something but that's a clear sign that education over incarceration
[02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:48.560]  education over incarceration and medical treatment and addressing
[02:44:48.560 --> 02:44:54.120]  people's needs spiritually economically or whatever as opposed to thinking that
[02:44:54.120 --> 02:44:57.960]  you can stop this with the iron fist of government with prohibition that's the
[02:44:57.960 --> 02:45:02.760]  thing that really bothers me so much to see how many Christians want to rely on
[02:45:02.760 --> 02:45:06.120]  the government to change people's hearts to change their lives and to do it with
[02:45:06.120 --> 02:45:09.680]  the iron fist of government rather than to do it with a helping hand okay oh
[02:45:09.680 --> 02:45:13.320]  wow with understanding and with saying look this is a medical problem this is a
[02:45:13.320 --> 02:45:16.360]  spiritual problem instead they just turn over and say no we're gonna make it a
[02:45:16.360 --> 02:45:19.120]  law enforcement problem and I've talked many times to law enforcement
[02:45:19.120 --> 02:45:24.400]  law enforcement officers against prohibition leap that CC is retired for
[02:45:24.400 --> 02:45:27.200]  the most part some of them are active but for the most part retired
[02:45:27.200 --> 02:45:31.560]  prosecutors police who have seen this side of it men of integrity who say
[02:45:31.560 --> 02:45:35.680]  this isn't working it's only making things worse wow and it's hard to get
[02:45:35.680 --> 02:45:39.080]  somebody that sits on the other side to say that so if you get somebody to say
[02:45:39.080 --> 02:45:43.600]  that you know you have an honest man because they get paid very well for that
[02:45:43.600 --> 02:45:46.840]  now the guy that was at the heart of this and and for people who don't know
[02:45:46.840 --> 02:45:52.920]  the history I mean I know Iran Contra really well it happened a couple of
[02:45:52.920 --> 02:45:57.400]  decades ago so there's a lot of people who don't really know it of course Iran
[02:45:57.400 --> 02:46:02.200]  was the big boogeyman then as they are now yeah and they had a lot of weapons
[02:46:02.200 --> 02:46:06.720]  that we had given them because we had installed a dictator the Shah of Iran
[02:46:06.720 --> 02:46:10.760]  we overthrew their democratically elected government and then we trained a
[02:46:10.760 --> 02:46:15.480]  ruthless police state organization called the Savak they were trained by the CIA
[02:46:15.480 --> 02:46:21.360]  now when they were overthrown that's when most Americans history of Iran
[02:46:21.360 --> 02:46:24.400]  begins when the embassy was overthrown they forget about all that stuff that
[02:46:24.400 --> 02:46:28.000]  happened they don't know it or care anything about the CIA is Savak they
[02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:31.760]  don't know about the overthrow of the government so when all that happened and
[02:46:31.760 --> 02:46:36.320]  they took the embassy hostage that's that's when Americans started paying
[02:46:36.320 --> 02:46:40.320]  attention they never paid any attention to it before that now as Ronald Reagan
[02:46:40.320 --> 02:46:45.680]  came in really kind of on the cusp of people's discussed with Carter Carter's
[02:46:45.680 --> 02:46:50.400]  inability to do anything to get the house the hostages out
[02:46:50.400 --> 02:46:54.640]  Reagan was going to be very tough with Iran and yet he was making these deals
[02:46:54.640 --> 02:46:58.980]  to give them spare parts for the planes that we had already sold them and what
[02:46:58.980 --> 02:47:03.520]  he was doing to fund that he was he was taking the secret money giving them
[02:47:03.520 --> 02:47:08.320]  parts and funding his other war in South America he said that he didn't have
[02:47:08.320 --> 02:47:13.400]  any problem taking the Shah's money Iran's money and then he would
[02:47:13.400 --> 02:47:18.040]  continually do it remember he said that at the hearings that's right at the
[02:47:18.040 --> 02:47:21.200]  congress hearings and then you got all over north running the iran contrast
[02:47:21.200 --> 02:47:26.520]  right okay so so they're funneling money selling selling weapons to our
[02:47:26.520 --> 02:47:32.320]  terrorist enemies okay and then creating a war of terrorism in Nicaragua at the
[02:47:32.320 --> 02:47:37.280]  same time then taking that using the drug trade they created with the crack
[02:47:37.280 --> 02:47:40.680]  cocaine industry to also fund their terrorist because yes what you know they
[02:47:40.680 --> 02:47:44.480]  needed money that they didn't have to show because Congress had told them not
[02:47:44.480 --> 02:47:48.320]  to bother the Contras at all they had that was against the law yeah to do
[02:47:48.320 --> 02:47:53.320]  anything with the Contras yes so they did it anyway so much for the law so
[02:47:53.320 --> 02:47:55.920]  much for the respect for the Constitution I mean they didn't respect the
[02:47:55.920 --> 02:48:00.960]  Constitution they didn't respect the law but it's amazing to me as things
[02:48:00.960 --> 02:48:05.760]  change we see how little they change you know in this particular case as as Gary
[02:48:05.760 --> 02:48:11.360]  Webb investigated it he found at the source a guy Oscar Danilo Blandone who
[02:48:11.360 --> 02:48:15.280]  had close ties with the Contras he interviewed him several times he put
[02:48:15.280 --> 02:48:18.640]  all this stuff together this is all the part of your story okay yes and as you
[02:48:18.640 --> 02:48:24.880]  mentioned this guy Blandone went to jail for only 24 months but you got life in
[02:48:24.880 --> 02:48:28.800]  prison and you didn't even say how much drugs he had yeah tell us how many
[02:48:28.800 --> 02:48:34.320]  thousand keys well well and he got 24 months in jail yeah when what about that
[02:48:34.320 --> 02:48:40.240]  when though we had the mandatory yeah my first cell he was 18 years old they
[02:48:40.240 --> 02:48:45.920]  arrested him on his 18th birthday he got 20 years in prison for two ounces of
[02:48:45.920 --> 02:48:52.880]  crack cocaine wow first offense wow and this guy had 10,000 keys but it was
[02:48:52.880 --> 02:49:00.720]  powder it was a crack right yeah so then he gets out after his little of course
[02:49:00.720 --> 02:49:05.240]  it's like we see this all the time I mean you know HSBCs is involved in money
[02:49:05.240 --> 02:49:08.560]  laundering for drug cartels and funding terrorists and everything and they get a
[02:49:08.560 --> 02:49:13.960]  very very small fine and nobody goes to jail okay but if you have a small
[02:49:13.960 --> 02:49:17.800]  business and they don't like the way that you did your cash reporting when you
[02:49:17.800 --> 02:49:21.300]  put that money in the bank you can go you can have that money confiscated they
[02:49:21.300 --> 02:49:24.520]  can even send you to jail for structuring okay so the the little guys
[02:49:24.520 --> 02:49:28.040]  are going to jail the big guys are going free this particular guy Blandone
[02:49:28.040 --> 02:49:32.240]  after his 24 months sentence he gets out and he gets a job with the DEA go
[02:49:32.240 --> 02:49:36.760]  straight from the CIA to the DEA as you mentioned wow without a green card yeah
[02:49:36.760 --> 02:49:41.160]  oh that's right yeah they made him up to yeah you know they made him up one he
[02:49:41.160 --> 02:49:45.520]  didn't have a real green card the DEA got him you know a fake so he was an
[02:49:45.520 --> 02:49:53.720]  undocumented CIA CIA worker he was became a documented DEA worker well talk
[02:49:53.720 --> 02:49:58.440]  to us about what what turned you around well when I was in prison and and all
[02:49:58.440 --> 02:50:02.920]  of this stuff started to come to me and then I started to feel like maybe I'd
[02:50:02.920 --> 02:50:09.040]  been duped maybe I wasn't dumb but I've been taught to be dumb mm-hmm so I
[02:50:09.040 --> 02:50:12.400]  started to just test myself you know I taught myself to read or write while I
[02:50:12.400 --> 02:50:17.400]  was there I eventually found the issue they got myself out of prison mm-hmm I
[02:50:17.400 --> 02:50:22.680]  started to write this book while I was still in prison this book was gonna be
[02:50:22.680 --> 02:50:28.840]  my way if I never got out to give back to all the kids in this country to to
[02:50:28.840 --> 02:50:33.400]  educate them on what I went through how I became a drug dealer because I didn't
[02:50:33.400 --> 02:50:38.920]  want to be a drug dealer it was not my plan when I was 18 years off somebody
[02:50:38.920 --> 02:50:42.440]  would have told me when I was 18 years old six months before I started selling
[02:50:42.440 --> 02:50:46.560]  some part of that that I was gonna be a drug dealer out of that right hang on we

[02:54:21.800 --> 02:54:25.000]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and I'm joined here in
[02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:30.360]  the studio with freeway Rick Ross we've been talking for the last hour to him
[02:54:30.360 --> 02:54:35.160]  about his amazing lifetime he's had a situation start out very poor in the
[02:54:35.160 --> 02:54:39.640]  inner city went into the drug trade big time became one of the biggest drug
[02:54:39.640 --> 02:54:46.800]  dealers ever then went to jail educated himself found a way to get out of jail
[02:54:46.800 --> 02:54:50.760]  and now he is explaining all of this and of course one of the reasons that we
[02:54:50.760 --> 02:54:55.920]  have him here is because he realized eventually that he was being used by the
[02:54:55.920 --> 02:55:01.200]  CIA as to fund the contrast that's the those are the people that basically
[02:55:01.200 --> 02:55:05.040]  created the crack cocaine epidemic in LA and of course there's a very good
[02:55:05.040 --> 02:55:11.080]  fictional movie kill the messenger about Gary Webb who exposed all this and his
[02:55:11.080 --> 02:55:15.640]  series of investigative journalism dark alliance he was eventually I believe
[02:55:15.640 --> 02:55:19.880]  killed by the government because he was not about to shut up they did
[02:55:19.880 --> 02:55:24.560]  everything they could discredit him they did yeah they did job yeah that's the
[02:55:24.560 --> 02:55:27.440]  first thing they did was took his job told me couldn't write anymore for no
[02:55:27.440 --> 02:55:32.400]  no newspapers would hire possibly one of the best writers of that time it was
[02:55:32.400 --> 02:55:36.960]  very well documented he won awards the LA Times covered all this and then all
[02:55:36.960 --> 02:55:41.080]  of a sudden everybody went against him and they all came after him then the LA
[02:55:41.080 --> 02:55:45.640]  Times had like a large group and I forget the exact numbers like 10 or 12
[02:55:45.640 --> 02:55:50.600]  reports set up to just to discredit him Jesse Katz was the main one a reporter
[02:55:50.600 --> 02:55:56.360]  that I had a relationship with while I was in prison and after I was out of
[02:55:56.360 --> 02:56:00.360]  prison and matter of fact Jesse's on the documentary my documentary cracking the
[02:56:00.360 --> 02:56:05.840]  system and he explains that him going after being a hired gun basically yes
[02:56:05.840 --> 02:56:10.640]  it was a hired gun and went after a character assassination yeah and as I
[02:56:10.640 --> 02:56:12.720]  always say you know first they assassinate your character then they
[02:56:12.720 --> 02:56:15.720]  assassinate you it was initially reported that he'd shot himself they've
[02:56:15.720 --> 02:56:19.920]  been shot once you you know assassinate his character now everybody thinks that
[02:56:19.920 --> 02:56:26.240]  he's mud and mm-hmm whatever you do to mud you know is okay yeah yeah just get
[02:56:26.240 --> 02:56:29.640]  rid of it they reported that he'd been shot twice in the head then they said
[02:56:29.640 --> 02:56:32.880]  no it's suicide and I said oh no we never said he was shot twice in the head
[02:56:32.880 --> 02:56:37.760]  and yet he had been on Alex Jones multiple times just before he died he
[02:56:37.760 --> 02:56:42.640]  was coming back with another book and he was very much still a fighter just
[02:56:42.640 --> 02:56:45.240]  as Aaron Schwartz was I don't believe Aaron Schwartz was driven to suicide

[02:58:15.400 --> 02:58:18.600]  rights as part of the civil rights movie you think that that's the way to
[02:58:18.600 --> 02:58:22.720]  approach this by federalizing the police and making all of them come from one
[02:58:22.720 --> 02:58:26.960]  location no I don't think so I think that this is a citizen's issue this is a
[02:58:26.960 --> 02:58:31.960]  thing where the citizens need to take control of their communities we're about
[02:58:31.960 --> 02:58:35.160]  at a time I tell you what I want people know where to find you freeway Ricky on

[03:00:07.600 --> 03:00:17.800]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[03:00:17.800 --> 03:00:21.360]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and I have with me freeway
[03:00:21.360 --> 03:00:25.040]  Rick Ross and I wanted to go in to overdrive because I wanted to give him a
[03:00:25.040 --> 03:00:29.920]  little bit more time to respond to Al Sharpton and also one let you know where
[03:00:29.920 --> 03:00:34.400]  he's going to be on this particular book tour now we played that clip from
[03:00:34.400 --> 03:00:40.720]  Al Sharpton in the last segment he was saying that we need to fight to have the
[03:00:40.720 --> 03:00:45.320]  police control by the federal government how do you feel about that I don't
[03:00:45.320 --> 03:00:51.200]  think that that's the case I believe that police should come from us as a
[03:00:51.200 --> 03:00:57.780]  people not from some one body or one person determining how our police
[03:00:57.780 --> 03:01:02.560]  police are our communities I believe that the police should come from that
[03:01:02.560 --> 03:01:08.720]  community yes you know more so than then from outside what I'm finding is a
[03:01:08.720 --> 03:01:12.080]  problem with most of these areas is that the police are not from that particular
[03:01:12.080 --> 03:01:17.480]  area they don't know the people in that area they don't get out and mingle with
[03:01:17.480 --> 03:01:21.680]  the people and you know a lot of the police that they hide right now are
[03:01:21.680 --> 03:01:25.760]  people that are coming from Iraq and in from these wars who are former
[03:01:25.760 --> 03:01:30.440]  military and are easy to put in these positions and the way that they're
[03:01:30.440 --> 03:01:34.800]  training them with the shoot first no hesitation targets we see targets coming
[03:01:34.800 --> 03:01:38.120]  up and of course they're not black people necessarily on these targets they
[03:01:38.120 --> 03:01:42.520]  had pictures of a white kid a white pregnant lady a white elderly person I
[03:01:42.520 --> 03:01:46.600]  mean this is not about the racism paradigm that Al Sharpton was to make it
[03:01:46.600 --> 03:01:49.640]  about it's really about respecting people as individuals I think you hit the
[03:01:49.640 --> 03:01:53.120]  nail on the head when you said it has to be part of the community absolutely
[03:01:53.120 --> 03:01:56.880]  make back about our history you know we we always talk about the dangers of a
[03:01:56.880 --> 03:02:01.920]  standing army and of course the founders had talked about that they saw our
[03:02:01.920 --> 03:02:05.280]  country that the right way to protect our country would be something like they
[03:02:05.280 --> 03:02:09.840]  have in Switzerland where the people take responsibility the people have you've
[03:02:09.840 --> 03:02:13.040]  got a militia is essentially is what they called it what the founders called it
[03:02:13.040 --> 03:02:16.680]  where they're trained to defend the country Switzerland doesn't get involved
[03:02:16.680 --> 03:02:19.880]  in foreign wars like America does we get involved in foreign wars because we
[03:02:19.880 --> 03:02:24.160]  have a standing army but now we have a standing army of policemen because we
[03:02:24.160 --> 03:02:28.480]  have said we're going to give people uniforms and badges to stand over us
[03:02:28.480 --> 03:02:32.040]  and the community is not going to be involved with its own security yeah yeah
[03:02:32.040 --> 03:02:35.600]  that's trouble and yeah I mean even to the point where they say you can't talk
[03:02:35.600 --> 03:02:41.320]  back to the police you know now I was at a former in Houston just the other day
[03:02:41.320 --> 03:02:45.560]  and they're teaching the kids not to talk back to the police you know and in
[03:02:45.560 --> 03:02:50.000]  in a lot of ways they're teaching them to save the kids' lives because you know
[03:02:50.000 --> 03:02:53.120]  if you talk back you can get killed yeah but it shouldn't be like that it
[03:02:53.120 --> 03:02:55.800]  shouldn't be like that you should be that if you give a if you look sideways
[03:02:55.800 --> 03:02:59.240]  at somebody and they're that they're just gonna shoot you or they're gonna beat
[03:02:59.240 --> 03:03:02.880]  you to death and we see that happening in reality in America in the streets of
[03:03:02.880 --> 03:03:06.440]  America absolutely absolutely and we used to have a situation where there
[03:03:06.440 --> 03:03:09.320]  would be one sheriff and a couple of deputies and if something big happened
[03:03:09.320 --> 03:03:12.320]  in the community if the bank was robbed you know I'm talking about a Western we've
[03:03:12.320 --> 03:03:15.960]  all seen the westerns right they'd get the posse together okay posse comma
[03:03:15.960 --> 03:03:20.040]  taught us was the power of the community absolutely okay you saw the same sort of
[03:03:20.040 --> 03:03:24.800]  thing with the black Panthers in the early days the old black Panthers where
[03:03:24.800 --> 03:03:28.520]  they would patrol that particular area we saw the same thing with some police in
[03:03:28.520 --> 03:03:33.360]  New York there was a whistleblower Adrian Schoolcraft when he was blowing the
[03:03:33.360 --> 03:03:36.400]  whistle and the police's punishment they would put him walking a beat and he said
[03:03:36.400 --> 03:03:39.920]  that's what I want to do I get to know the people in the community you can start
[03:03:39.920 --> 03:03:44.680]  just a standard and think that this standard is gonna work for every place
[03:03:44.680 --> 03:03:48.880]  in this country because it's so this country so diverse yes from city to
[03:03:48.880 --> 03:03:52.440]  city it's different I mean I'm having the privilege now just traveling from
[03:03:52.440 --> 03:03:56.160]  city to city something I didn't even do back in the days and I'm just seeing how
[03:03:56.160 --> 03:03:59.640]  people are the same but they are different yes you know they look at
[03:03:59.640 --> 03:04:03.840]  things different they they act different they speak different so when we try to
[03:04:03.840 --> 03:04:07.360]  solve everything outside of in Washington what we do is we remove
[03:04:07.360 --> 03:04:11.160]  government very distant from the community so if we were to follow Al
[03:04:11.160 --> 03:04:14.400]  Sharpton's recommendations you wouldn't have more community involvement you
[03:04:14.400 --> 03:04:17.920]  would have less it would be dictated to you by people that are thousands of miles
[03:04:17.920 --> 03:04:20.880]  away as you point out very different as you travel the country with your book
[03:04:20.880 --> 03:04:25.560]  tour and let's talk about that but but just to say that when you centralize
[03:04:25.560 --> 03:04:29.520]  everything you also centralize the opportunity for corruption you can have
[03:04:29.520 --> 03:04:33.680]  corrupt individual governments but not have that your book tour you're going
[03:04:33.680 --> 03:04:39.200]  out to Kaleen Texas where you're gonna be out being Kaleen Texas the 8th I'm
