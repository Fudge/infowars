[00:00.000 --> 00:16.780]  Waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones
[00:16.780 --> 00:36.460]  Bill Clinton is a rapist! Bill Clinton raped Juanita Broderick!
[00:36.460 --> 00:48.940]  Bass Concert Hall, Austin, Texas, last night.
[00:48.940 --> 01:18.100]  Inside Bass Concert Hall, where Bill Clinton took his book tour, outside protestors'
[01:18.100 --> 01:19.100]  get-up.
[01:19.100 --> 01:29.620]  Bill Clinton is a rapist, so we need to go ahead and protest and hopefully we've got
[01:29.620 --> 01:57.420]  some info warriors inside who can ask him some tough questions because that would be awesome.
[01:57.420 --> 02:01.980]  Don't take me out of my comfort zone here. I'm in a Bill Clinton book tour. I paid $100
[02:01.980 --> 02:05.340]  to be here. I don't want to hear about the Lolita Express.
[02:05.340 --> 02:11.100]  So the full video is on the Alex Jones YouTube channel. Welcome to the Alex Jones show. This
[02:11.100 --> 02:16.140]  is Owens Royer Alex Jones joining us here momentarily. Last night we had a protest outside
[02:16.140 --> 02:20.820]  Bass Concert Hall. There were at least five people inside Bass Concert Hall that shouted
[02:20.820 --> 02:24.260]  at Bill Clinton, called him out for the Lolita Express and the rape. We're going to be joined
[02:24.260 --> 02:29.460]  by two of them in studio, but first Alex Jones joins us on the phone. Alex, amazing times
[02:29.460 --> 02:34.340]  we're living in here. Patriots are finally standing up to the treasonous tyrants that
[02:34.340 --> 02:36.020]  have been running our government for decades.
[02:36.020 --> 02:40.020]  That's right. I'm here on a work occasion with family, but I tell you, I wish I could
[02:40.020 --> 02:44.460]  be there in Austin with you. It was Mike Sernovich about a week ago, sent me a text message
[02:44.460 --> 02:48.460]  and said, hey, you know, Bill Clinton's going to be in Austin. So I told you guys about
[02:48.460 --> 02:52.860]  it, and that's just why it's great that everybody always stay in contact with each other because
[02:52.860 --> 02:58.460]  now this just happened. We had the one individual on a few days ago who started the ball rolling
[02:58.460 --> 03:03.860]  in Pennsylvania. I did a great job. They got millions of views online, and now you had
[03:03.860 --> 03:09.820]  at least five people inside, dozens outside demonstrating with really powerful signs and
[03:09.820 --> 03:15.820]  making the leftist zombies who have this fake moral high ground and are openly trying to
[03:15.820 --> 03:19.740]  bring up our families, openly trying to destroy our borders, openly trying to basically bring
[03:19.740 --> 03:24.300]  down civilization because they're social engineers and their own admissions. They want to end
[03:24.300 --> 03:29.780]  the family and take full control. That's top academics in the U.S. and England now admit
[03:29.780 --> 03:33.180]  their whole plan. And so they have to come in all these government workers, all these
[03:33.180 --> 03:37.740]  bureaucrats, all these people and know that they don't have the moral high ground and
[03:37.740 --> 03:42.980]  that they're God, William Jefferson Clinton, who sold us out to the Communist Chinese, who
[03:42.980 --> 03:49.340]  came after our guns, who helped cripple Maroncha as this whole evil Clinton cabal and what
[03:49.340 --> 03:55.820]  it represents, circles, the vortex of hell, or the toilet bowl of hell. As all of this
[03:55.820 --> 04:00.940]  happens now, you can guarantee, ladies and gentlemen, that just like during the campaign
[04:00.940 --> 04:04.220]  everywhere he went, he got called a rapist, which he said of all those rape cases. He's
[04:04.220 --> 04:08.220]  famous for it, but they expressed by the fall plane, Hillary Clinton in the Arab Spring
[04:08.220 --> 04:12.180]  killing hundreds of thousands, well, almost a million people, hundreds of thousands of
[04:12.180 --> 04:17.380]  women and children put into slavery. I mean, it's incredible. These people are monsters.
[04:17.380 --> 04:23.660]  They're absolute, total, complete monsters that then every time there's a mass shooting
[04:23.660 --> 04:29.100]  at the media, hikes up and pushes and promotes a phenomenon totally manufactured by the media
[04:29.100 --> 04:33.620]  with these mental patients, you know, devil worshipers that are always on Prozac. The
[04:33.620 --> 04:37.420]  same story always happens. They then pointed all gun owners and said that we're immoral
[04:37.420 --> 04:42.860]  and we're bad and we're evil. No, you're immoral. You're bad. You're evil. And all of this
[04:42.860 --> 04:50.220]  on the heels of Trump devastating the globalists at the G7, calling them all out. All of them
[04:50.220 --> 04:54.780]  in that photo that I tweeted out on Saturday and Sunday, we can put up for real Alex Jones
[04:54.780 --> 05:00.860]  that was everywhere. They're all gathered around him, him sitting there. Nothing to
[05:00.860 --> 05:06.060]  see here, folks, just Iran admitting to helping with the 9-11 terror attacks. Free Beacon
[05:06.060 --> 05:10.900]  reports that Iranian officials have admitted to facilitating the 9-11 terrorist attacks
[05:10.900 --> 05:15.740]  in the U.S. by secretly aiding the free travel of al-Qaeda operatives, who eventually went
[05:15.740 --> 05:18.700]  on to fly commercial airliners into the Twin Towers.
[05:18.700 --> 05:23.500]  Speaking on Iran's state-controlled television, an international affairs assistant in Iran's
[05:23.500 --> 05:28.740]  judiciary, Mohammad Javed Larjani, said that Iranian intelligence officials did not stamp
[05:28.740 --> 05:33.220]  the passports of the al-Qaeda militants in order to conceal their movements and prevent
[05:33.220 --> 05:37.700]  detection by foreign governments. Al-Qaeda operatives were also given safe refuge in
[05:37.700 --> 05:42.300]  Iran. The U.S. government has long accused Iran of playing a role in the attacks, and
[05:42.300 --> 05:47.340]  the U.S. 9-11 commission concluded that Iran played a role in facilitating the al-Qaeda
[05:47.340 --> 05:51.860]  terrorist. But these remarks represent the very first time that senior Iranian officials
[05:51.860 --> 05:56.700]  have publicly admitted to aiding al-Qaeda and playing a direct role in facilitating
[05:56.700 --> 06:16.700]  the 9-11 attacks.

[01:47:00.700 --> 01:47:09.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:09.700 --> 01:47:27.700]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show and now your host, Owen Shroyer.
[01:47:27.700 --> 01:47:39.700]  You know, I would be remiss if I went any further and I didn't give a huge shout out to all of the Info-Warriors that came out last night and protested the Bill Clinton book tour with us.
[01:47:39.700 --> 01:47:45.700]  But you heard Alex earlier talking about how he's been more recognized than ever, he gets sworn more than ever.
[01:47:45.700 --> 01:48:01.700]  I mean, the average Info-Warrior out there that I've met is just such a good person. These are the people that make America great. These are the people that raise great families.
[01:48:01.700 --> 01:48:18.700]  I'm out last night, standing on the street, waiting for a ride. I can't believe I forgot the gentleman's name. Family man, family immigrated here, just a total champion, a patriot, a veteran, and he just pulls over and he's like,
[01:48:18.700 --> 01:48:34.700]  Hey, has anyone ever told you you look like Owen Shroyer? And I'm like, oh no, you got the wrong guy. He's like, no, no, Shroyer. And he gives me a ride home. I try to pay him money. He refuses payment. I mean, it's just, honestly, you people that support us, that I meet, and that shake our hands.
[01:48:34.700 --> 01:48:52.700]  I mean, seriously, I love you guys. You guys make everything we do here worthwhile, and it's us together getting active, getting engaged, that's changing the world. And you might not be able to see it if you just have a flash and you just look at the world.
[01:48:52.700 --> 01:49:07.700]  You still see all the scum. You still see all the degradation. You still see, you know, all the depression and everything. But we're getting active now and we're pushing back. And the momentum is truly going the other way for America now.
[01:49:07.700 --> 01:49:16.700]  This is not going to be a simple, quick process. This is going to take years to do. But we've got the momentum on our side now and we're going in the right direction.
[01:49:16.700 --> 01:49:29.700]  So I just want to salute everybody that was there, everybody I meet, everybody that shakes my hand. You guys, you make it all possible, and you just keep us driving to be even better.
[01:49:29.700 --> 01:49:37.700]  All right, where do I want to go here? So first, let's just go with this madness. We've got a lot of madness here, actually.
[01:49:37.700 --> 01:49:50.700]  Inside Obama's secret meetings with 2020 contenders. So it's now clear that Barack Obama is now the cult thought leader of the left. It is now clear he's the one telling Jay-Z.
[01:49:50.700 --> 01:50:00.700]  He's the one dictating the entire hip hop rap industry can't meet with Trump. So there's the cult leader Obama telling you who you can and can't speak to with his operative Jay-Z.
[01:50:00.700 --> 01:50:09.700]  The spirit cookers. Oh, and by the way, this Robert Neneiro, which we'll just go to now here, but just real quick.
[01:50:09.700 --> 01:50:18.700]  First of all, the story says they're considering Bernie Sanders. That's not going to work. Bernie Sanders isn't a registered Democrat.
[01:50:18.700 --> 01:50:24.700]  The Democrat said only a registered Democrat can run this year. So if Bernie runs and is independent, that'll kill the Democrat Party. Wouldn't that be beautiful?
[01:50:24.700 --> 01:50:33.700]  But they're honestly considering Elizabeth Warren. Oh, my God. Elizabeth Warren.
[01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:43.700]  Oh, a moldy ham sandwich from the year 2008 is more viable than Elizabeth Warren. I mean, my goodness.
[01:50:43.700 --> 01:50:49.700]  I'm hoping to be joined by Shiva Ayaduray on Wednesday. We have to get Shiva Ayaduray in.
[01:50:49.700 --> 01:50:55.700]  We have to get Dr. Shiva Ayaduray in to defeat Elizabeth Warren. It is a necessity.
[01:50:55.700 --> 01:51:02.700]  And you know, I'm just afraid they just rigged these elections with these electronic voter machines, man, especially with these local deals.
[01:51:02.700 --> 01:51:10.700]  How does Elizabeth Warren being considered for president? A total fop. A known liar.
[01:51:10.700 --> 01:51:16.700]  Oh, you know, you know, here's what would be beautiful.
[01:51:16.700 --> 01:51:23.700]  This is to show you how desperate they are. If Dr. Shiva Ayaduray defeats Elizabeth Warren in the midterms, which, oh, my God.
[01:51:23.700 --> 01:51:30.700]  I mean, just get on your knees and pray that that happens. And then they try to resurrect Elizabeth Warren with a presidential election.
[01:51:30.700 --> 01:51:39.700]  Or imagine they put her as the front runner and then she lose her Senate seat. Oh, oh, my gosh.
[01:51:39.700 --> 01:51:49.700]  Sorry, I'm getting, I'm getting all giddy here. I'm getting little butterflies inside. Elizabeth Warren as a Democrat Party candidate for president.
[01:51:49.700 --> 01:52:00.700]  She's like, she's like Mo from the Three Stooges Ugly Cousin. Oh, my gosh.
[01:52:00.700 --> 01:52:05.700]  I'm sorry. These people are so pathetic, man. I'm telling you, that's the most amazing thing.
[01:52:05.700 --> 01:52:13.700]  People like Nancy Pelosi, Elizabeth Warren, Maxine Waters, Joe Biden, these people are pathetic, man. You are better than this stum.
[01:52:13.700 --> 01:52:24.700]  I just wish people realized these are people just like you, but they're worse than you. Just because they somehow made it into office doesn't mean they're above you.
[01:52:24.700 --> 01:52:31.700]  They are beneath you. You are the real people. You have the power.
[01:52:31.700 --> 01:52:37.700]  Anyway, Robert De Niro, first of all, let's just a little more ridiculousness here.
[01:52:37.700 --> 01:52:42.700]  Twitter CEO says he was wrong to eat at Chick-fil-A.
[01:52:42.700 --> 01:52:52.700]  Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey on Sunday expressed regret over eating at Chick-fil-A because of the chicken company's CEO's personal views on gay marriage.
[01:52:52.700 --> 01:52:57.700]  Mark Dorsey says, I'm sorry for eating a chicken sandwich.
[01:52:57.700 --> 01:53:03.700]  That's right. I'm sorry for eating a chicken sandwich. I'm Jack Dorsey.
[01:53:03.700 --> 01:53:09.700]  Now let's go to clip for Robert De Niro at the Tony Awards last night. Nobody was watching.
[01:53:09.700 --> 01:53:16.700]  Listen to Robert De Niro's unhinged rant, who's also friends with Marina Abramovich, the spirit cooker.
[01:53:16.700 --> 01:53:24.700]  Maybe De Niro gets in on some of that. Listen to Robert De Niro's unhinged rant against President Trump last night at the Tony Awards.
[01:53:24.700 --> 01:53:35.700]  Oh, the whole thing just bleeped?
[01:53:35.700 --> 01:53:39.700]  He can't even play it. It's just bleep. The whole thing is bleeped.
[01:53:39.700 --> 01:53:45.700]  They love it, though. They're all cheering. He just goes, F Trump, and now they're all cheering and smiling.
[01:53:45.700 --> 01:53:53.700]  I'm the big strong man. I said F Trump. I'm Robert De Niro, a Hollywood fox.
[01:53:53.700 --> 01:53:57.700]  I'm a spirit cooker.
[01:53:57.700 --> 01:54:06.700]  These people are so unhinged. He's getting a standing ovation for saying F Trump.
[01:54:06.700 --> 01:54:13.700]  Oh, the intellectualism of Robert De Niro.
[01:54:13.700 --> 01:54:16.700]  Mr. De Niro, pull him down. Get him out of here.
[01:54:16.700 --> 01:54:20.700]  Mr. De Niro, this crowd here at the Tony's has gathered.
[01:54:20.700 --> 01:54:24.700]  They want you to say something striking. They want you to say something moving.
[01:54:24.700 --> 01:54:26.700]  They want you to say something intellectual.
[01:54:26.700 --> 01:54:29.700]  Mr. De Niro, do you think you could deliver?
[01:54:29.700 --> 01:54:33.700]  Well, I think it's going to be hard, but I think I got something for him.
[01:54:33.700 --> 01:54:42.700]  F Donald Trump.
[01:54:42.700 --> 01:54:44.700]  I'm Robert De Niro. I said F Trump.
[01:54:44.700 --> 01:54:51.700]  Yes, look at me. I had a victory. I had a victory. I said F Trump at the Tony's victory for me.
[01:54:51.700 --> 01:54:58.700]  You know what's sad about these people? They are so delusional now.
[01:54:58.700 --> 01:55:07.700]  They are so delusional now that this is how they get off because the rest of society has left them behind.
[01:55:07.700 --> 01:55:17.700]  You see, movie ratings are tanking. Hollywood is being exposed and they're being left behind by civilization.
[01:55:17.700 --> 01:55:27.700]  See, we're done with you. You're scum. You're frauds. You are the biggest phonies in this country.
[01:55:27.700 --> 01:55:33.700]  And so America's moving past Hollywood. We don't care. We don't bow down. We don't suck at the tee.
[01:55:33.700 --> 01:55:40.700]  Okay, we're done with you. And so now that they've realized that they've been left behind,
[01:55:40.700 --> 01:55:47.700]  now that they've realized they don't have control, their hubris is cracking and they're breaking down.
[01:55:47.700 --> 01:55:53.700]  See, they thought they controlled you. They thought if they said F Trump, you would never go to the polls and vote Trump.
[01:55:53.700 --> 01:56:00.700]  Oh, but the opposite happened. So now they're having their own reckoning and you're seeing them break down.
[01:56:00.700 --> 01:56:08.700]  And then there's an added element to this with the sex cults being exposed, the Weinstein rapes being exposed.
[01:56:08.700 --> 01:56:17.700]  All of this coming out. And there you go. Robert De Niro is friends with Weinstein. Robert De Niro is friends with Abramovich.
[01:56:17.700 --> 01:56:24.700]  Ah, and now you see how the world turns.
[01:56:24.700 --> 01:56:35.700]  You know, I wish I had time to play this other madness. But we're going to be joined by Dan Lyman on the other side.
[01:56:35.700 --> 01:56:46.700]  But maybe I'll go to the editor of the Atlantic saying that this is Trump's punishment for not being good enough citizens.
[01:56:46.700 --> 01:56:55.700]  About Vanity Fair reporters saying that the Trump family women are dead inside. No, no, no, it's Vanity Fair that's dead inside.
[01:56:55.700 --> 01:57:05.700]  It's Hollywood that's dead inside. Okay, it's the radical left wing of the Democrat Party and the liberal street activists that are dead inside.
[01:57:05.700 --> 01:57:15.700]  It's Bill and Hillary Clinton that are dead inside. It's the hundreds of people that pay hundreds of dollars to go see Bill Clinton speak that are dead inside.
[01:57:15.700 --> 01:57:27.700]  They are the ones that are dead inside. They are the ones that have nothing. All they had was their phony corrupt power structure establishment.
[01:57:27.700 --> 01:57:34.700]  That's corrupting and falling down all around them. That's all they had. And now they have nothing. And you're seeing them freak out.
[01:57:34.700 --> 01:57:46.700]  Oh, I'm at the Tony's. F Trump. F Trump. Yeah. Nobody's watching you, Robert De Niro. You have destroyed your name, Robert De Niro. You did.
[01:57:46.700 --> 01:57:52.700]  Patrick in the great nation of Australia. You're on the air worldwide. Thanks for holding.
[01:57:52.700 --> 01:58:05.700]  Hey, I've been following you since I was 14. I'm 32 now. I remember back when info wars and prison planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and it had to load down the page on my dial up into that.
[01:58:05.700 --> 01:58:14.700]  And I thought it was pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests. And I've been using your products since the first iteration of survival shield.
[01:58:14.700 --> 01:58:23.700]  And since then, I'm on the X2, the super male vitality, the caveman, the real red pill, micro ZX body. It's all amazing. Thank you, brother.
[01:58:23.700 --> 01:58:31.700]  Yeah. And I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[01:58:31.700 --> 01:58:43.700]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God. And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[01:58:43.700 --> 01:58:57.700]  We can extend this free shipping sale much longer with our best selling items at m4store.com. In fact, we can only run it a few more days.
[01:58:57.700 --> 01:59:06.700]  We're also running out of some of our best selling items like our amazing Neutropic Rainforest. It's 1995. Leading competitors are $60 and aren't even as good.
[01:59:06.700 --> 01:59:15.700]  It's a great deal normally at $39.95. Rainforest, you've never tried it. This is a great opportunity. $19.95. Also, alpha power is 50% off.
[01:59:15.700 --> 01:59:21.700]  If you don't know what it's done for me and so many others for stamina, focus, libido, it does so many things.
[01:59:21.700 --> 01:59:34.700]  X2, even though we're having trouble sourcing the deep earth crystals of the good halogen iodine, I am blowing out the stockpile that we have at least for another few days at 50% off.
[01:59:34.700 --> 01:59:37.700]  And after that, it's going to go back to full price until we secure more of it.
[01:59:37.700 --> 01:59:43.700]  M4s, live.com, m4store.com, or triple-A-253-3139.
[01:59:43.700 --> 02:00:05.700]  Thank you all for helping fund the Second American Global Revolution.
[02:00:14.700 --> 02:00:30.700]  You know, watching Hollywood and the Robert De Niro's have this collapse and then in the break watching one of our history unleashed videos of the Rodney King riots, I realized something.
[02:00:30.700 --> 02:00:43.700]  I realized that we're not just living in 1984, we're not just living in Fahrenheit 451, we're also living in Lord of the Flies.
[02:00:43.700 --> 02:00:49.700]  And just like in Lord of the Flies, I need to go back and read that book now.
[02:00:49.700 --> 02:01:03.700]  When the situation got so desperate, the true self showed itself. The true ugliness reared its head and showed itself.
[02:01:03.700 --> 02:01:10.700]  And that's what the Lord of the Flies story is all about. That's what we're seeing now. That's Hollywood.
[02:01:10.700 --> 02:01:20.700]  Hollywood is now in the desperate dire straits and doing everything they can and freaking out and acting like, you know, cannibals.
[02:01:20.700 --> 02:01:30.700]  The same thing with the Rodney King riots, you can see it. People that walk around masquerading, like people on a moral high ground or whatever, then what happens?
[02:01:30.700 --> 02:01:37.700]  The Rodney King riots kick up and then what do they do? They go into their true state.
[02:01:37.700 --> 02:01:43.700]  Same thing happens with these protests. Look at what happens when we go to one of the women's marches.
[02:01:43.700 --> 02:01:50.700]  Do you see how they respond, folks? This is the Lord of the Flies moment. They're going crazy. They're going insane.
[02:01:50.700 --> 02:02:01.700]  They're going into their deep, deep, deep roots of hatred and disgust. This is their Lord of the Flies moment.
[02:02:01.700 --> 02:02:08.700]  And that's why you see Robert De Niro and the like masquerading around and making asses of themselves.
[02:02:08.700 --> 02:02:18.700]  But it doesn't stop there. Let's now go to the Atlantic editor. Listen to this absolute madness.
[02:02:18.700 --> 02:02:25.700]  Every thug, every dictator around the planet. You know, to your very first question about news fatigue, if your child is feverishly ill,
[02:02:25.700 --> 02:02:31.700]  it can be very fatiguing to sit by her bedside and take care of her. But it's what you do because that's your duty.
[02:02:31.700 --> 02:02:40.700]  I think your responsibility is also a source of satisfaction to you. If your country is ill, you have the same responsibility.
[02:02:40.700 --> 02:02:47.700]  There may be things that newsrooms can do differently or better to help people keep better track of the stories.
[02:02:47.700 --> 02:02:52.700]  But it's also your responsibility as a citizen. You can't put your responsibilities on the press and say,
[02:02:52.700 --> 02:02:58.700]  why didn't you make this easier for me or more entertaining? Why didn't you make the news less frightening than it really is?
[02:02:58.700 --> 02:03:06.700]  I would like a different truth, please. The job of the press is to tell you the truth as it is, whether it's good news or not.
[02:03:06.700 --> 02:03:12.700]  And then it's your responsibility as a patriot and as a citizen to accept it and to internalize it and to act on it.
[02:03:12.700 --> 02:03:18.700]  In many ways, we got Donald Trump in the first place as a punishment for not being good enough citizens.
[02:03:18.700 --> 02:03:24.700]  And our abilities mitigate the harm he's going to do to institutions, to alliances, to security of the world.
[02:03:24.700 --> 02:03:28.700]  Good! That's what we want! That's what I'm saying! These people don't get it! Get them out of here!
[02:03:28.700 --> 02:03:36.700]  David Frum is so removed from reality. This is like, okay.
[02:03:36.700 --> 02:03:46.700]  Sorry, ma'am, but we've just discovered that you have cancer and unfortunately we're going to have to remove it from you.
[02:03:46.700 --> 02:03:51.700]  So we're going to get rid of that cancer in your colon and we're going to get rid of that tumor in your brain.
[02:03:51.700 --> 02:03:56.700]  And I know, I know. That's just, that's just what we have to do. I know it's bad.
[02:03:56.700 --> 02:04:02.700]  The doctor's going to remove the cancer from you, but everybody wants the cancer to stay according to David Frum.
[02:04:02.700 --> 02:04:10.700]  And it's just like, what? They don't get it. We're sick of big government. We're sick of all these bureaucracies.
[02:04:10.700 --> 02:04:19.700]  I'm telling you, I can't even imagine. How do these people wake up every day and look themselves in the mirror?
[02:04:19.700 --> 02:04:24.700]  They're so lost. They are totally clueless. They're totally removed from society.
[02:04:24.700 --> 02:04:34.700]  Their arrogance has literally taken over their reality. It's put a veil over their eyes. They can't even see what's in front of them.
[02:04:34.700 --> 02:04:42.700]  And then listen to the faux intellectualism. Just, just, just total faux intellectualism. Just total fake.
[02:04:42.700 --> 02:04:47.700]  He sits there on a little two minute segment like, and he says nothing.
[02:04:47.700 --> 02:05:05.700]  CNN is fake news. Brian Seltzer is Pennywise. We'll be right back with Dan Lyman.
[02:05:17.700 --> 02:05:23.700]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[02:05:23.700 --> 02:05:29.700]  What we learned was that there was, in fact, unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[02:05:29.700 --> 02:05:36.700]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter, and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure,
[02:05:36.700 --> 02:05:40.700]  but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[02:05:40.700 --> 02:05:45.700]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water.
[02:05:45.700 --> 02:05:50.700]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[02:05:50.700 --> 02:05:55.700]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[02:06:04.700 --> 02:06:13.700]  You found it, the tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[02:06:13.700 --> 02:06:20.700]  Alright, there was so much news in the last week that we kind of, we didn't forget about Bilderberg,
[02:06:20.700 --> 02:06:26.700]  but it kind of just passed by without getting the coverage that it deserves.
[02:06:26.700 --> 02:06:32.700]  Of course, they used to deny that it even existed, but the big thing that they met about this year,
[02:06:32.700 --> 02:06:36.700]  just like last year, what to do about Trump, what to do about nationalism,
[02:06:36.700 --> 02:06:43.700]  and how can they save the New World Order One World Government, which they can't.
[02:06:43.700 --> 02:06:51.700]  The people are awakened now all over the world, so their plan is pretty much done.
[02:06:51.700 --> 02:06:54.700]  And so now they have to figure out some other way to bring it about,
[02:06:54.700 --> 02:06:59.700]  which would probably be even more torturous and deadly than their original plans.
[02:06:59.700 --> 02:07:02.700]  But Dan Lyman, he was covering the events.
[02:07:02.700 --> 02:07:07.700]  He is our Info Wars Europe writer out there, spearheading that movement.
[02:07:07.700 --> 02:07:10.700]  So Dan, what was the big developments? What was the big news?
[02:07:10.700 --> 02:07:18.700]  What would you say, just kind of as a overall consensus of the conclusion of Bilderberg 2018?
[02:07:18.700 --> 02:07:21.700]  I think it remains to be seen what they're taking out of this meeting,
[02:07:21.700 --> 02:07:24.700]  since we don't know exactly what went on there.
[02:07:24.700 --> 02:07:29.700]  But we did get a chance to confront a good, healthy dose of them on the second,
[02:07:29.700 --> 02:07:33.700]  or the third and fourth days, and they were very quiet.
[02:07:33.700 --> 02:07:35.700]  They didn't answer any questions.
[02:07:35.700 --> 02:07:40.700]  Beyond, there was one guy who said that the most interesting topic for him was populism in Europe.
[02:07:40.700 --> 02:07:45.700]  But in general, they were either totally radio silent when we tried to speak to them,
[02:07:45.700 --> 02:07:47.700]  or they would just tell us to go away.
[02:07:47.700 --> 02:07:50.700]  It was an interesting experience to say the least.
[02:07:50.700 --> 02:07:55.700]  Now, it seemed like there were less people out there, protesters or whatever,
[02:07:55.700 --> 02:07:56.700]  than in the past.
[02:07:56.700 --> 02:07:58.700]  Do you think that's why there were more people coming out and actually willing to talk to you?
[02:07:58.700 --> 02:08:02.700]  Because last year in Virginia, you couldn't even get a word in with any of these people.
[02:08:02.700 --> 02:08:04.700]  Yeah, I don't know.
[02:08:04.700 --> 02:08:09.700]  What worked well in our favor is that it's kind of in a semi-remote area of Italy,
[02:08:09.700 --> 02:08:12.700]  so there's just one little airport that services that area.
[02:08:12.700 --> 02:08:15.700]  And so we were able to camp out at the airport yesterday on the last day,
[02:08:15.700 --> 02:08:18.700]  and really catch a lot of them on their way into the airport.
[02:08:18.700 --> 02:08:21.700]  And then on the previous day, which is a Saturday,
[02:08:21.700 --> 02:08:25.700]  it was known as their day for excursions and activities.
[02:08:25.700 --> 02:08:29.700]  And that's when the joggers and the shoppers, let's say, go out.
[02:08:29.700 --> 02:08:32.700]  So we encountered a couple of them out on jogs.
[02:08:32.700 --> 02:08:36.700]  And one woman, a professor, Donica Kragic, that was out.
[02:08:36.700 --> 02:08:43.700]  She looked like she was about to start shopping at a nearby kind of a fine Italian goods food store.
[02:08:43.700 --> 02:08:47.700]  And then we caught up with her, and she had to rush back to the main entrance.
[02:08:47.700 --> 02:08:50.700]  But we got about five minutes with her, but she wasn't having it.
[02:08:50.700 --> 02:08:52.700]  Nobody was answering any questions.
[02:08:52.700 --> 02:08:53.700]  Yes.
[02:08:53.700 --> 02:08:57.700]  Avoid the journalist. Avoid that man.
[02:08:57.700 --> 02:08:59.700]  That man, that man is a journalist.
[02:08:59.700 --> 02:09:02.700]  Don't you know that's a terrorist around here?
[02:09:02.700 --> 02:09:04.700]  Yeah, there was some of that, too.
[02:09:04.700 --> 02:09:08.700]  A couple journalists were treated as terrorists,
[02:09:08.700 --> 02:09:13.700]  whether intentionally or to throw them off a bit,
[02:09:13.700 --> 02:09:15.700]  or mistakenly, we're not sure.
[02:09:15.700 --> 02:09:21.700]  So a couple of them, one guy was actually woken up at gunpoint in the middle of the night at his apartment.
[02:09:21.700 --> 02:09:24.700]  We're actually going to be talking to him later on the war room.
[02:09:24.700 --> 02:09:26.700]  He had a pretty terrifying experience.
[02:09:26.700 --> 02:09:30.700]  And then they later told him that they were searching for a terrorist in his building,
[02:09:30.700 --> 02:09:31.700]  and they apologized.
[02:09:31.700 --> 02:09:35.700]  But then they came back with his landlord and asked him more questions as to why he was there.
[02:09:35.700 --> 02:09:39.700]  So it's up to anyone's speculation as to what was going on there.
[02:09:39.700 --> 02:09:41.700]  Well, so a lot of weird activity with that going on.
[02:09:41.700 --> 02:09:44.700]  And again, the war room runs at infowars.com.
[02:09:44.700 --> 02:09:47.700]  So I show from three to six p.m. central here weekdays.
[02:09:47.700 --> 02:09:51.700]  Dan will be on there with the journalist he was speaking about.
[02:09:51.700 --> 02:09:57.700]  But it's funny because the whole notion that they try to pull a veil over the public's face is that,
[02:09:57.700 --> 02:10:01.700]  oh, the Bilderberg meeting is for the good of the people, right?
[02:10:01.700 --> 02:10:04.700]  These elites, these world elites, they're meeting for the good of the people.
[02:10:04.700 --> 02:10:06.700]  They want to make the world a better place.
[02:10:06.700 --> 02:10:09.700]  Oh, but then why don't you talk to the media?
[02:10:09.700 --> 02:10:12.700]  Why don't you actually just do a broadcast of all your meetings?
[02:10:12.700 --> 02:10:14.700]  Why all the secrecy?
[02:10:14.700 --> 02:10:20.700]  I mean, isn't that the ultimate display of how there are a bunch of phonies and liars
[02:10:20.700 --> 02:10:22.700]  that they try to act like they're doing this for the betterment of mankind,
[02:10:22.700 --> 02:10:24.700]  but they do it all in secrecy?
[02:10:24.700 --> 02:10:28.700]  Well, if you're trying to help us, why are you doing it in secret?
[02:10:28.700 --> 02:10:30.700]  Right. And they had a lot of journalists in there.
[02:10:30.700 --> 02:10:32.700]  I think we might have spoken about this last week,
[02:10:32.700 --> 02:10:37.700]  but there was like at least 12 people who were directly affiliated with media organizations.
[02:10:37.700 --> 02:10:43.700]  And then, of course, many of these industrialists are also indirectly or directly linked to them
[02:10:43.700 --> 02:10:45.700]  behind the scenes as well.
[02:10:45.700 --> 02:10:49.700]  And what was funny is a lot of these folks, they won't even answer a question.
[02:10:49.700 --> 02:10:51.700]  Some of them will say they don't know what we're talking about,
[02:10:51.700 --> 02:10:53.700]  but then there was the occasional one we'd say,
[02:10:53.700 --> 02:10:55.700]  were you at the Bilderberg conference?
[02:10:55.700 --> 02:10:57.700]  So you'd Bilderberg attendee and they'd say, yes, I was.
[02:10:57.700 --> 02:10:59.700]  And then that was it.
[02:10:59.700 --> 02:11:05.700]  So it's like the secrecy cracks slightly just enough so that we know it's not a conspiracy theory.
[02:11:05.700 --> 02:11:08.700]  It has an official name, an official agenda, an official website,
[02:11:08.700 --> 02:11:11.700]  and they were all there for the same reason.
[02:11:11.700 --> 02:11:17.700]  And again, I just don't understand why they wouldn't be broadcasting this stuff, talking to media.
[02:11:17.700 --> 02:11:18.700]  But you know what they're doing.
[02:11:18.700 --> 02:11:21.700]  The reason why they invite this media in there now is to say, oh, we did, though.
[02:11:21.700 --> 02:11:22.700]  Oh, we had media here.
[02:11:22.700 --> 02:11:26.700]  You know, like, oh, like that's how they do the whole website and the whole unveil of the Bilderberg group.
[02:11:26.700 --> 02:11:28.700]  Like, oh, we're not trying to hide.
[02:11:28.700 --> 02:11:30.700]  Oh, wait, you were for secret for 50 years.
[02:11:30.700 --> 02:11:31.700]  The media said you didn't exist.
[02:11:31.700 --> 02:11:33.700]  Oh, but you're not trying to hide.
[02:11:33.700 --> 02:11:34.700]  Oh, we're not trying to avoid the media.
[02:11:34.700 --> 02:11:35.700]  We invited people from the media.
[02:11:35.700 --> 02:11:37.700]  Come on.
[02:11:37.700 --> 02:11:44.700]  Yeah, select chosen few, of course, and it's funny, one of the agenda items that they released as one of their talking points
[02:11:44.700 --> 02:11:47.700]  was that they're addressing the post-truth world.
[02:11:47.700 --> 02:11:54.700]  And I asked a couple of them, how does it benefit combating the post-truth world if you're all having this secret meeting
[02:11:54.700 --> 02:11:59.700]  that you won't tell us about what goes on in the inside, but they would not answer that question.
[02:11:59.700 --> 02:12:00.700]  Shocking.
[02:12:00.700 --> 02:12:05.700]  Actually, I said that we're in the post-post-truth world.
[02:12:05.700 --> 02:12:07.700]  I mean, that's really what we're dealing with now.
[02:12:07.700 --> 02:12:13.700]  We've been in the post-truth world, now we're in the post-post-truth world, and they're freaking out.
[02:12:13.700 --> 02:12:15.700]  That's why they're having secret meetings.
[02:12:15.700 --> 02:12:21.700]  That's why they're pretending to let journalists in there, like some veil of transparency.
[02:12:21.700 --> 02:12:25.700]  What about the Vatican coming and having the meeting with the Bilderbergers?
[02:12:25.700 --> 02:12:27.700]  What did you learn about that?
[02:12:27.700 --> 02:12:29.700]  Anything new?
[02:12:29.700 --> 02:12:33.700]  We weren't able to learn anything about what was discussed inside,
[02:12:33.700 --> 02:12:35.700]  but that was a big development.
[02:12:35.700 --> 02:12:37.700]  That was something a lot of people had their eye on.
[02:12:37.700 --> 02:12:41.700]  And I was speaking to a local journalist there, and he made such a great point.
[02:12:41.700 --> 02:12:43.700]  He said, I'm not even a Catholic.
[02:12:43.700 --> 02:12:50.700]  He said, but I would be really concerned as a Catholic if the Vatican felt that it was part of their responsibility
[02:12:50.700 --> 02:12:54.700]  to be sending someone to this confab full of elitists.
[02:12:54.700 --> 02:13:01.700]  A lot of them are definitely not Christians, and many of them would be opposed to Christianity in general.
[02:13:01.700 --> 02:13:07.700]  So why would the Vatican feel the need to be in on this very secret meeting with these very powerful people?
[02:13:07.700 --> 02:13:09.700]  And I thought that was a great point.
[02:13:09.700 --> 02:13:13.700]  If I was a Catholic, I would be concerned what my church was getting involved in
[02:13:13.700 --> 02:13:19.700]  if they weren't already aware that the church has, of course, been involved in these types of things for centuries.
[02:13:19.700 --> 02:13:26.700]  I think truth be told, you've got two of the big groups that have been pulling the strings on this planet
[02:13:26.700 --> 02:13:32.700]  as far as social developments, what have you, with the Bilderberg group and with the Vatican.
[02:13:32.700 --> 02:13:39.700]  So I would imagine that they're meeting to try to figure out how to wrangle back into power the narrative,
[02:13:39.700 --> 02:13:43.700]  wrangle back into power their control where it's depleting now, nationalism is rising,
[02:13:43.700 --> 02:13:49.700]  Trump getting elected, other people like Trump are starting to rise, the ranks in other countries.
[02:13:49.700 --> 02:13:57.700]  Or is this about all the pedophilia and the sex cults that are being exposed, not just in Hollywood,
[02:13:57.700 --> 02:13:58.700]  but also in the Vatican.
[02:13:58.700 --> 02:14:03.700]  So there may be some of that and trying to stitch all that together.
[02:14:03.700 --> 02:14:08.700]  But here's the thing to me, why is it such a big deal?
[02:14:08.700 --> 02:14:10.700]  Why do they freak out?
[02:14:10.700 --> 02:14:15.700]  It's like this, the left will protest Donald Trump every day, all day.
[02:14:15.700 --> 02:14:20.700]  Okay, fine, all right, fine, he's the president, you don't like him, you think it's bad, perfectly fine.
[02:14:20.700 --> 02:14:22.700]  Where are you at the Bilderberg group?
[02:14:22.700 --> 02:14:23.700]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:14:23.700 --> 02:14:31.700]  It's like this is the power structure that has caused you to be in this tizzy and they don't even understand it.
[02:14:31.700 --> 02:14:35.700]  It's like they deny it exists or they just don't even want to cross that bridge
[02:14:35.700 --> 02:14:38.700]  because it might be too hard to figure out what's going on there.
[02:14:38.700 --> 02:14:40.700]  But what are other journalists saying?
[02:14:40.700 --> 02:14:44.700]  Are they wondering why the media doesn't make a bigger deal of this, why more people aren't protesting?
[02:14:44.700 --> 02:14:47.700]  That was an interesting aspect to all of this.
[02:14:47.700 --> 02:14:52.700]  This was my first time covering Bilderberg, but I was with other folks who have done 10, 12 of these
[02:14:52.700 --> 02:14:58.700]  and they're quite accustomed to major protests at some of them, especially the ones in Europe.
[02:14:58.700 --> 02:15:01.700]  The DC ones seem to, they get some protests as well.
[02:15:01.700 --> 02:15:06.700]  But anyways, these guys were shocked that there was not even a single protester this year.
[02:15:06.700 --> 02:15:12.700]  Not one in all four days we didn't encounter any and there would have been an opportunity if they wanted to protest.
[02:15:12.700 --> 02:15:15.700]  They could have assembled, of course, not even one.
[02:15:15.700 --> 02:15:24.700]  So I think I don't even know what to make of that yet, but a lot of the vets said that this was the strangest, quietest year that they've been a part of.
[02:15:24.700 --> 02:15:30.700]  I mean, it's almost in a way a symbol of them losing power.
[02:15:30.700 --> 02:15:37.700]  It's kind of like what we were talking about before where it's like we've almost kind of won the battle of exposing the Bilderberg group.
[02:15:37.700 --> 02:15:39.700]  So we've kind of just left it.
[02:15:39.700 --> 02:15:45.700]  We kind of just left that steaming pile of ash and we've moved on, but they're still operating.
[02:15:45.700 --> 02:15:49.700]  They're still trying to get their power structure back in order.
[02:15:49.700 --> 02:15:54.700]  So the battle's not over yet, but we did expose them and that's the key. We'll be right back.
[02:15:54.700 --> 02:15:58.700]  We call it the crapper, water closet, outhouse or bathroom.
[02:15:58.700 --> 02:16:01.700]  But where do you go when there's nowhere to go?
[02:16:01.700 --> 02:16:03.700]  The answer is the Biffy Bag.

[02:20:22.700 --> 02:20:26.700]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:20:37.700 --> 02:20:48.700]  Dan Lyman is my guest here for one more segment and we're talking Bilderberg Group. It was held in Italy this year which is interesting considering the nationalism that is sweeping over Italy right now
[02:20:48.700 --> 02:20:57.700]  and a new crop of politicians that are willing to stand up for Italy, willing to fight for its borders, willing to fight for its sovereignty.
[02:20:57.700 --> 02:21:06.700]  And I'm just curious, Dan, how much did you see evidence of this when you were in Turin? I mean, what was the energy like?
[02:21:06.700 --> 02:21:16.700]  I mean, I know that you're not an expert in Italian, but I'm sure you were able to have some conversations, get some feeling of the sentiment right now in Italy.
[02:21:16.700 --> 02:21:23.700]  I mean, are people aware of this nationalist uprising right now? Is this something that's sweeping Italy?
[02:21:23.700 --> 02:21:34.700]  As soon as I got on the ground there, I quickly vived immediately and was witness to the two things that is driving populism in Europe and especially in Italy.
[02:21:34.700 --> 02:21:51.700]  That would be immigration and the migrant situation and also the economy. The economy in Italy is definitely not doing well. If I'm not mistaken, the true unemployment rate is somewhere in the ballpark of 20% overall and then with the youth unemployment closer to 40.
[02:21:51.700 --> 02:22:04.700]  So when I got there, I got off at the train station, walked to the hotel and I couldn't believe how just rundown things look at least in the part of town that I was in and the amount of migrants that I encountered as well.
[02:22:04.700 --> 02:22:17.700]  They were just everywhere. So the next day I did some more walking around and went to some other parts of town. They're a little bit better, but there are just like a lot of clothes storefronts and just businesses that are not operating anymore.
[02:22:17.700 --> 02:22:30.700]  Some of the most graffiti I've ever seen, which some people might not care about that sort of thing, but to me it's an indicator that there are a lot of youth in the area with nothing better to do than to tag up businesses, cars even.
[02:22:30.700 --> 02:22:40.700]  They were tagging on cars. So I could see the two things that are driving populism and people who are just totally sick of the status quo and why they would vote for something different.
[02:22:40.700 --> 02:22:55.700]  And I just did an article today. One of the things that I found out, one of the reasons why I saw so many migrants in such a rundown area right off the bat was that I had walked by what was formerly the Olympic athletes village when Turin hosted the 2006 Winter Games.
[02:22:55.700 --> 02:23:10.700]  And the buildings there that formerly housed the athletes, they went vacant and then migrants just moved in and now it's one of the largest migrant encampments in the region. There's over a thousand mostly African migrants living in these four high rises.
[02:23:10.700 --> 02:23:24.700]  And everything in the area like around it is just run down. I didn't really feel too safe walking through there. I wanted to get some footage inside like the courtyard of this complex and it just looked too seedy for me to even enter.
[02:23:24.700 --> 02:23:34.700]  So I just did some shots on the outside. But that was what I encountered. And I encountered tons of migrants in a really nice park where there was like other people there like, you know, eating from food trucks and stuff.
[02:23:34.700 --> 02:23:44.700]  And there's just like young migrant men sitting around kind of leering at the women and pass that on benches and stuff. So I could see how the immigration thing is really grating on people.
[02:23:44.700 --> 02:23:55.700]  And I did have a chance to talk to some local Turin folk, including like a cab driver who I didn't identify myself to. He lived there his whole life. And he said, since the 1980s, the place has just been changing radically.
[02:23:55.700 --> 02:24:05.700]  And he said very specifically, there's some very dangerous people in town now. And I got that same feedback from a couple of other folks from Turin, including a guy who now lives in Russia.
[02:24:05.700 --> 02:24:22.700]  He moved to Moscow to get away from Turin. He said he feels much safer in Moscow. He happened to be back in Turin over the weekend visiting family. So I can see why people want a huge change because things are not going well, at least in that part of Italy, from my understanding.
[02:24:22.700 --> 02:24:37.700]  Well, I'm so glad you said that because, you know, you look at the situation. And I know people that traveled to Europe regularly since the 80s, you know, Italy, England, Spain, France, they love touring in Europe.
[02:24:37.700 --> 02:24:46.700]  But in the last 10 years, things have gotten so bad in some of these countries, they don't go anymore. They won't go to France anymore. They won't go to Italy anymore.
[02:24:46.700 --> 02:24:57.700]  And it's because exactly of what you just described, where, I mean, it's a situation that nobody wants to, you know, really talk about because you feel bad for people living in desperate situations.
[02:24:57.700 --> 02:25:06.700]  But at the same time, you know, Italy, this is a beautiful nation. This is a nation with a lot of history. This is a nation that's famous for its architecture.
[02:25:06.700 --> 02:25:16.700]  You know, you have an Olympic village that gets built and it's such a sad situation that they can't even do anything with it afterwards. It's like, oh, we just built this probably multimillion dollar facility.
[02:25:16.700 --> 02:25:24.700]  And now that, you know, everything's gone. Well, we really don't have the means or the wherewithal to do anything with it. So it just gets overrun by these migrants.
[02:25:24.700 --> 02:25:39.700]  And it was amazing. I saw your story on the no-go zones. So you're telling me that it's very similar to the no-go zones in Sweden and in England where, you know, you can't even go into those areas without, you know, facing a threat of violence.
[02:25:39.700 --> 02:25:50.700]  I wasn't about to risk it. It looked unsafe. And to be honest, I'm on my own. Maybe if I had a few folks with me or perhaps something to defend myself with, I might have taken a pass through.
[02:25:50.700 --> 02:25:58.700]  But I mean, it was just, it did not look like the kind of place you'd want to walk through. I was talking to a local journalist there, a young guy by the name of Luca Donadalli.
[02:25:58.700 --> 02:26:11.700]  He's done some great videos exposing the migrant crisis, especially as how it pertains to Italy. And he said that this specific enclave, there have been girls that are walking by unaware and then they've been pulled in and raped.
[02:26:11.700 --> 02:26:21.700]  And the cops can't do anything or won't do anything because it's just, it's very risky. They don't want to rock the boat too much with these folks because they do tend to riot.
[02:26:21.700 --> 02:26:34.700]  And also they just, they have no grasp on who is in there. There's like, you know, old rooms and apartments in there that just have like tons of folks sleeping on mattresses and people that kind of pass through town and stay for a little while.
[02:26:34.700 --> 02:26:43.700]  And then some folks that are there for longer. And it's just like, it's really depressing. And it's just one of other migrant encampments around town, my understanding.
[02:26:43.700 --> 02:26:54.700]  Well, yeah, Turin is actually, you know, Turin is actually more inland. It's actually a lot worse if you go down and like to the tip of Italy and, you know, the islands and, you know, southern Italy is actually a lot worse.
[02:26:54.700 --> 02:27:03.700]  I would imagine, you know, that's where they're coming in. But there's this weird element, Dan, where it's like, oh, you know, I don't really want to go visit Italy anymore.
[02:27:03.700 --> 02:27:08.700]  It's been run down, you know, there's these migrants everywhere. There's these ghettos everywhere. I don't want to go tour there anymore. It's not fun.
[02:27:08.700 --> 02:27:15.700]  And so they'll say, oh my gosh, you're so insensitive. You're so intolerant. Well, how dare you say something like that? It's like, what?
[02:27:15.700 --> 02:27:24.700]  If I want to go on vacation, I want to go somewhere beautiful. I don't want to deal with all the degradation. I don't want to deal with all the, you know, sadness and depression in society.
[02:27:24.700 --> 02:27:33.700]  That doesn't mean I'm intolerant. That doesn't mean I'm insensitive. It's like, they want to beat. It's like, just accept it. Just accept the filth. Just accept the degradation.
[02:27:33.700 --> 02:27:40.700]  Accept the collapse of society. Embrace it. And you're just like, no. It's like, well, really, do you go hang out in the ghettos or the inner cities for fun?
[02:27:40.700 --> 02:27:48.700]  I mean, that's what they want you to do. Just accept everything collapsing around you. Otherwise, you're intolerant and insensitive.
[02:27:48.700 --> 02:28:02.700]  Yeah, I have friends who ask, you know, where do I, where should I visit or I'm going to come out and visit? Where should I go? And I say, look, if you feel the need to see the London, Rome, Paris, you know, circuit, by all means, do that, you know, they are, they have been magnificent cities.
[02:28:02.700 --> 02:28:14.700]  There's still plenty to see. Say, however, if you want a better time and you want a little safer and just see something different, I say, go to Eastern Europe, try something else, go to Krakow, you know, go to Tallinn and Estonia.
[02:28:14.700 --> 02:28:26.700]  But personally, I don't spend, I don't spend any time even in these countries. It's just not appealing to me. I know there's plenty of great places in the countryside, but frankly, you know, it's, it's not the same as it used to be.
[02:28:26.700 --> 02:28:38.700]  And we know this is all part of the agenda of population control, civilization control and the destruction of great nations like Italy, like Spain, like France, like England, like America.
[02:28:38.700 --> 02:28:48.700]  They bring these great historical nations to its knees, bring so much degradation to these areas that you beg for the New World Order to come save you. That's Dan Lyman.
[02:28:48.700 --> 02:29:12.700]  He departs now. We'll be right back with more of the AJ Show. Don't go anywhere.

[02:35:44.700 --> 02:35:55.700]  Now, of course, that comes with great risk. We know that the radical left and its minions are getting more violent and more vile and hate-filled by the day, by the hour.
[02:35:55.700 --> 02:36:07.700]  But people are telling me that they're wearing their shirts out and actually getting more positive responses, like 10 to 1 even, positive responses versus the negativity of the brainwashed minions.
[02:36:07.700 --> 02:36:15.700]  And there's all kinds of t-shirts available at InfoWarsStore.com. Some of the classics are still available. The tyranny response team, that's a classic.
[02:36:15.700 --> 02:36:24.700]  Of course, the anti-fascist shirt really triggers the left. They thought that they were the anti-fascist. They actually are the foot soldiers of the fascist.
[02:36:24.700 --> 02:36:31.700]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Is that a Bill Clinton rape t-shirt? Hold on a second. Go to the Bill Clinton rape t-shirt.
[02:36:31.700 --> 02:36:37.700]  Yeah, yeah, okay. It's on the waiting list. I was going to say, I thought we were sold out of that. Yeah, you have to get on the waiting list for the Bill Clinton rape t-shirt.
[02:36:37.700 --> 02:36:49.700]  It's a top seller. It's a top seller. It'll be in the Smithsonian, to quote Roger Stone, the Bill Clinton classic Bill Clinton rape t-shirt.

[02:37:18.700 --> 02:37:30.700]  Now, we're going to be joined by Alex Jones in the next segment. I'm not sure where I want to go here. Let me just, let me just get through some of this news here.
[02:37:30.700 --> 02:37:41.700]  Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. I found the Russian collusion. I've got the Russian collusion right here. This is breaking.
[02:37:41.700 --> 02:37:50.700]  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner pose with Alex Ovechkin after Stanley Cup win.
[02:37:50.700 --> 02:38:01.700]  Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Alex Ovechkin. Oh my gosh. He's a Russian hockey player. Can we pull up the image of Jared and Ivanka with Alex Ovechkin?
[02:38:01.700 --> 02:38:20.700]  Has someone told Eric Swalwell about this? Has someone told Adam Schiff about this? Oh my gosh. Oh my. Is that Ivanka Trump wearing red lipstick?
[02:38:20.700 --> 02:38:32.700]  Oh, there it is. I didn't believe it till I saw this. I didn't believe it. I thought it was a made up fake news story Russian collusion, but there it is right there.
[02:38:32.700 --> 02:38:47.700]  What more do you need to see? Alex Ovechkin, the Ruski, and Ivanka and Jared Trump or Jared Kushner. Folks, this is breaking. This is breaking.
[02:38:47.700 --> 02:38:52.700]  This is the Russian collusion we've been waiting for. This is the Russian collusion.
[02:38:52.700 --> 02:39:01.700]  Didn't you see Alex Ovechkin, the Russian hockey player, the capital of the Stanley Cup champions posing with Jared and Ivanka?
[02:39:01.700 --> 02:39:11.700]  Of course, the irony of this joke is there's more proof of Russian collusion in that photo than anything the Democrat Party or the media has presented to us.
[02:39:11.700 --> 02:39:17.700]  So how do you like them apples?
[02:39:17.700 --> 02:39:29.700]  But Ivanka's wearing red lipstick. She's obviously signaling to all the Russian comrades out there. That's right. We're colluding with the Russians.
[02:39:29.700 --> 02:39:39.700]  In fact, we rigged the Stanley Cup to make sure the Russian won. Didn't you know the Russians control everything?
[02:39:39.700 --> 02:39:44.700]  They don't just control the election. They control the NHL.
[02:39:44.700 --> 02:39:54.700]  There it is, Alex Ovechkin. He's actually running the whole show. Yeah, he's only got like three teeth. That's all you need to run the show here as a Russian agent.
[02:39:54.700 --> 02:39:57.700]  So there it is, folks.
[02:39:57.700 --> 02:40:07.700]  More evidence than the entire Democrat Party has provided for Russian collusion in one picture with Jared Ivanka and Alex Ovechkin.
[02:40:07.700 --> 02:40:18.700]  Unbelievable. We need to let Eric Swalwell know about this. Can you pull up Eric Swalwell's Twitter? He asked me blowing up today.
[02:40:18.700 --> 02:40:29.700]  Eric Swalwell, he knew it. Eric Swalwell told me he knew that Trump was colluding with Russia. I should have known it was Alex Ovechkin.
[02:40:29.700 --> 02:40:35.700]  Oh my gosh. Eric Swalwell hasn't tweeted in 19 hours.
[02:40:35.700 --> 02:40:39.700]  Oh, he doesn't even know yet.
[02:40:39.700 --> 02:40:45.700]  Okay, we need to contact Eric Swalwell's office and let him know we finally found the Russian collusion. I thought Swalwell was nuts.
[02:40:45.700 --> 02:40:53.700]  I thought he was nuts, but we found it. Jared Ivanka and the Stanley Cup champion, Alex Ovechkin. Okay. So there it is, Russian collusion proved.
[02:40:53.700 --> 02:40:59.700]  All right, let's get into something real here. YouTube terminates channel of firearms parts retailer.
[02:40:59.700 --> 02:41:05.700]  We don't talk about it enough, but the censorship on Twitter and YouTube just continues to manifest itself.
[02:41:05.700 --> 02:41:13.700]  In fact, I was wondering why I don't tweet from my Twitter anymore. I don't get on there. All I do is own.
[02:41:13.700 --> 02:41:20.700]  But I had like 66,000 followers or something and I get new followers every day.
[02:41:20.700 --> 02:41:28.700]  I get new followers every day. Oh, CJ Pearson has now been deleted from Twitter. Of course, a conservative, a young conservative. How dare he?
[02:41:28.700 --> 02:41:32.700]  I am now losing followers every day on Twitter, even though I'm gaining followers.
[02:41:32.700 --> 02:41:42.700]  In fact, I set something out and so when a few people responded, they were like, hey, I followed you a couple years ago and I went and looked at your account and I was not following you anymore.
[02:41:42.700 --> 02:41:51.700]  So now Twitter is unfollowing people. I mean, this is crazy. YouTube is erasing channels out of nowhere.
[02:41:51.700 --> 02:41:57.700]  Yeah, you're not allowed to sell firearms parts on YouTube anymore. Didn't you know? It's free speech.
[02:41:57.700 --> 02:42:03.700]  You're not allowed to support Trump on Twitter anymore. Didn't you know? It's free speech.
[02:42:03.700 --> 02:42:13.700]  Remember the scandal-free Obama? Not so much. Over 600 gigabytes of highly sensitive U.S. Navy data compromise and Chinese hack.
[02:42:13.700 --> 02:42:20.700]  Do you remember how you had multiple Navy vessels crash?
[02:42:20.700 --> 02:42:28.700]  I believe it may have even been in the Asia Seas and it was like, what's going on? These naval vessels are crashing. They're losing control.
[02:42:28.700 --> 02:42:32.700]  They've got all this radar and all these teams. Why are they crashing?
[02:42:32.700 --> 02:42:43.700]  Ah, Obama put in weak leaders of the Navy. Obama put in Fox to lead the Navy and then it got hacked by China.
[02:42:43.700 --> 02:42:50.700]  Oh, but Russia is the enemy though. Russia is the big problem. No, China is. They're hacking our data.

[02:46:52.700 --> 02:47:07.700]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[02:47:07.700 --> 02:47:27.700]  Well, I've got to tell you here, as we're about to be joined by Alex Jones, that everything that we've been fighting for, the truth, the justice, the liberty, the independence, is finally starting to manifest itself.
[02:47:27.700 --> 02:47:37.700]  But that doesn't mean we take our foot off the gas. That means we ram the gas pedal even harder through the floor of the car and ram it down the globalist throats.
[02:47:37.700 --> 02:47:52.700]  Alex Jones joins me now. Alex, what is it like, though, you've been fighting this battle for 20 years to finally see it manifesting itself, to finally see the fruits of all the effort, the sweat, the blood and tears that you have put in to changing this world?
[02:47:52.700 --> 02:48:06.700]  Well, I always had a private joke around the office some and also the family that even though beards have been in style for about 10 years, I've never grown one, even though I grew one back when I was at 20 for a while, only the time I had a beard.
[02:48:06.700 --> 02:48:15.700]  I said, until we turn the tide, I'm not going to grow a beard. But yes, ladies and gentlemen, we've now turned the tide. The war has just started, but we're beginning to win.
[02:48:15.700 --> 02:48:23.700]  The globalists are on their heels. So at least for the next month or so, I'm going to go ahead and fulfill that promise and grow a beard. So that's that's the type of stuff we're talking about.
[02:48:23.700 --> 02:48:35.700]  I've also said that if we continue to be reversed on our heels, and I might just shave my head as a symbol of it, but instead, ladies and gentlemen, I am growing a beard for now, just to symbolize the fact that liberty is in full bloom.
[02:48:35.700 --> 02:48:55.700]  And the ghost of Christmas present is here in big time ways. But to get serious, what Trump's doing where they have 200%, 270% tariffs, 100% tariffs, 30% tariffs, 50% tariffs on just everything you can imagine from automobiles to dairy products.
[02:48:55.700 --> 02:49:08.700]  It's a big screw America over Joe. That's how at the end of World War Two, we had half the world's wealth or that half the world's industry. And the globalist openly wrote books on this and said, we will parlay that into a total world government.
[02:49:08.700 --> 02:49:20.700]  And then we will transfer the power to these multinational corporations in the UN. They will be tax exempt. I say this every segment because it's critical that we will be tax exempt. The globalist said, we will have diplomatic immunity.
[02:49:20.700 --> 02:49:32.700]  We will be above the law. And then we will come in with draconian collectivist regulations and controls in the U.S. particularly to put us into submission so that then we quote be a service economy.
[02:49:32.700 --> 02:49:41.700]  And then if you weren't a good little globalist, you wouldn't get that job either in government universities or the so-called service economy because they don't want yeoman independent farmers.
[02:49:41.700 --> 02:49:53.700]  They don't want independent machine shops. They don't want independent artisans and craftsmen and women. They don't want independent hotel chains, independent businesses, independent grocery stores.
[02:49:53.700 --> 02:50:01.700]  They want everything totally big box store absolutely centralized. And again, there's nothing wrong with big box if it's standalone.
[02:50:01.700 --> 02:50:13.700]  But this is being done on record to vertically integrate economies and consolidate control. And Trump's just, yeah, you know what? I'm not out to get America. And these one sided trade deals are jokes.
[02:50:13.700 --> 02:50:20.700]  You know, that's what I said during the campaign. I said, Trump's for real. The lie that he doesn't want to win is a lie. The lie that he won't run again is a lie.
[02:50:20.700 --> 02:50:31.700]  The lie that, you know, he wouldn't get out in campaign for the midterm elections. He was really some type of Hillary shell. All of that is a fraud. Trump's name has been poured into this.
[02:50:31.700 --> 02:50:44.700]  His family, his entire system, he gave up hundreds and hundreds of millions losing all the big golf tour championships and losing the big women's, you know, you know, Miss America type pageants.
[02:50:44.700 --> 02:50:58.700]  Billions reportedly lost total for Trump, 500 million, mainly his own money he spent in the campaign with Hillary five to one, six to one, spending against him.
[02:50:58.700 --> 02:51:08.700]  Total commitment. And so if he's the turnaround guy for America, if he's the turnaround guy for Western civilization, if he's the turnaround guy when America was in the jaws of the globalist,
[02:51:08.700 --> 02:51:18.700]  that just from a cynical sociopathic view, if you really wanted to be, you know, George Washington 2.0 is would be what you did. But see, it's not cynical.
[02:51:18.700 --> 02:51:28.700]  Trump, the globalist are cynical. And for them, if they could destroy America because of its symbol of freedom and then parlay that into global control, that is having the cake and eating it too.
[02:51:28.700 --> 02:51:41.700]  But now the fact that they were so arrogant as David Rockefeller Bragg setting up 30 globalist organizations like the UN, that they could suppress the free market, create a crony capitalist system, sell us on that,
[02:51:41.700 --> 02:51:51.700]  and then have this group of multinationals above the law with all of us as debt slaves to them. The idea of that is just insane. They would ever get away with it.
[02:51:51.700 --> 02:51:58.700]  But they basically almost got away with it, and they still haven't been completely defeated. They've still got their trillions of stolen money.
[02:51:58.700 --> 02:52:07.700]  All of it based on tax exempt operations, all of it based on tax-free foundations, all of it based on $1.50 per package now for every visa package he ships.
[02:52:07.700 --> 02:52:11.700]  But you or I don't get that. M4 doesn't get that when we ship packages.
[02:52:11.700 --> 02:52:22.700]  All of this is about one-sided insider deals. Behind Apple are the worst slave factories on the planet. Behind Apple are the tax exemptions and the fact that their state run now by the Communist Chinese.
[02:52:22.700 --> 02:52:27.700]  These are real statements. And so, yes, we have the surveillance state. Yes, we have all these serious problems.
[02:52:27.700 --> 02:52:36.700]  But now we're having a real reconciling of it and a real out in the open discussion of it, and the stonewalling of the Democrats and the globalists isn't working anymore.
[02:52:36.700 --> 02:52:45.700]  So this is a very, very historic time. That's why I'll be back Thursday, and we're going to have a 34-hour global transmission from David night at 8 a.m.
[02:52:45.700 --> 02:52:57.700]  Right through to the next day when Owen goes off with the War Room, with Roger Stone and others at 6 o'clock central, looking at the Inspector General Report and the cornered rat that is the deep state.
[02:52:57.700 --> 02:53:08.700]  And what will its collapse look like? Because it will still reorganize and still keep striking back at us until we've broken the corrupt, unelected, dictatorial, New Soviet Union, E.U.
[02:53:08.700 --> 02:53:19.700]  Until we've broken the criminal activity of the IMF World Bank and Proud of Fellow Reserve. Until we've broken Google and its monopoly of 93% of search functions and many other operations.
[02:53:19.700 --> 02:53:32.700]  And it's spy grid that's totally illegal. Until we've broken all of these corrupt systems like Facebook and Twitter and Amazon that, again, is working against gun owners, working against Americans.
[02:53:32.700 --> 02:53:40.700]  When they could still be a big successful company, just don't be monopolistic, don't shut down local businesses, and don't get tax exemption and don't get taxpayer money.
[02:53:40.700 --> 02:53:49.700]  But no, Tim Cook and Apple and all these groups are wanted to fight. They sowed the wind. They're going to reap the whirlwind.
[02:53:49.700 --> 02:54:01.700]  And the fact is, you can see the exponential winning that's happening when we had people in charge that were suppressing us in their own admissions by design in hundreds of textbooks saying we're going to destroy your families.
[02:54:01.700 --> 02:54:08.700]  We're going to bankrupt you. We're going to bring America to heel. There's lots of quotes about bringing over 100 years ago, the Big Banking Association, said,
[02:54:08.700 --> 02:54:17.700]  we're going to bring the American people and these farmers and these folks that won't turn their guns in, these people that, you know, all these independent newspapers that don't like the robber barons, the big railroads,
[02:54:17.700 --> 02:54:25.700]  Rockefellers and others said, Standard Oil, JP Morgan, they said, we're going to teach these Americans to come to heel. We're going to break their will. These are quotes.
[02:54:25.700 --> 02:54:32.700]  Just like Hillary said, we're going to teach these blacks to come to heel. It's the same crap. They talk about us all the same. We're the common scum. We're the filth.
[02:54:32.700 --> 02:54:38.700]  Because they're sociopaths and psychopaths, so they have this innate hate for everybody. It's really a hate for themselves.
[02:54:38.700 --> 02:54:48.700]  So once you're in the perspective that they don't like seeing you with a nice car or good medicine or healthcare or having a good life, or, you know, I mean, globalists at Bilderberg always leaks go,
[02:54:48.700 --> 02:54:55.700]  how can these people have money for transportation or to protest us? How can they even get here? We want them poor so they can't do this.
[02:54:55.700 --> 02:55:04.700]  Just like Latin America and Africa uses that to control their people. It's called serfdom, and the Renaissance has been fighting serfdom for 550 years.
[02:55:04.700 --> 02:55:15.700]  We just haven't realized it yet, but we're about to go into the real third act, the real delivery of the Renaissance, if the globalists can be stopped and we still face a lot.
[02:55:15.700 --> 02:55:25.700]  Now, that said, we're going to break. You're going to continue in with Ali Alexander, super smart guy, with viceandvictory.com, big political insider, smart guy with the Trump Revolution.
[02:55:25.700 --> 02:55:32.700]  Just starting to go public the last year because the fight is so intense. He's going to be joining us.
[02:55:32.700 --> 02:55:39.700]  Owen's going to be riding a shotgun with him some into the next hour, then the war room gets saddled up with the folks that are hosting that today.
[02:55:39.700 --> 02:55:46.700]  They've been doing a great job, Rob do. Of course, all the rest of the people that I've seen hosting that have been doing a fabulous job.
[02:55:46.700 --> 02:55:54.700]  Harrison, of course, Mr. Lloyd and everybody else. So there's a whole crew there at M4s. I salute you. I salute the listeners.
[02:55:54.700 --> 02:56:00.700]  But I always said thousands of times, globalism is unelected. Globalism is tyrannical. Globalism is out of control.
[02:56:00.700 --> 02:56:11.700]  Globalism is exempt. Globalist is the new royalty. And if we just expose it, it'll be dead on arrival. There's no way people won't go along with being free instead of going along with being slaves.
[02:56:11.700 --> 02:56:17.700]  There's no way people will go along with lying to their children and giving them no future once they know the truth.
[02:56:17.700 --> 02:56:24.700]  There's no way people are going to put up with globalism once they understand it's real. So all the stonewalling about this stuff is over.
[02:56:24.700 --> 02:56:32.700]  We push globalists into the light. This audience did and you deserve to know what you've done, not to all pat each other on the back,
[02:56:32.700 --> 02:56:38.700]  but to realize we have the ball now and nothing can stop us as long as we take action. So please pray for M4s.
[02:56:38.700 --> 02:56:46.700]  Please spread the live videos, the articles, overpower their AI, overpower their sensors, or take on the comment sections out of all the big establishment sites
[02:56:46.700 --> 02:56:51.700]  because they're dying, their traffic's cratering. They don't want you to have a voice. They don't want you to have a say.
[02:56:51.700 --> 02:56:58.700]  They want you to shut up and go along with them and be their little minions. So whatever you do, hit them, hit them, hit them, hit them, hit them hard.
[02:56:58.700 --> 02:57:03.700]  That's why they're bullying. That's why there's all the peer pressure. That's why they're trying to shut you up, make you feel alone
[02:57:03.700 --> 02:57:08.700]  so that you go away so they can dominate and get back in control. They're losing. It's a war.
[02:57:08.700 --> 02:57:15.700]  You know, we weren't popular with King George III back during the Civil War with the Brits that created our country.
[02:57:15.700 --> 02:57:21.700]  We weren't popular with Hitler. We were kicking his ass for the Soviet Union. We are going to win.
[02:57:21.700 --> 02:57:26.700]  We're not trying to be popular with the globalists. We're overturning the corrupt fraudulent system and returning the Republic.
[02:57:26.700 --> 02:57:30.700]  Please don't forget, we're going to end it this week, free shipping the last week, storewide.
[02:57:30.700 --> 02:57:34.700]  M4store.com and huge deals like 50% on X2, even though it's running out.
[02:57:34.700 --> 02:57:40.700]  We hope to get another deeper source. Whatever you do, be part of the Second American Revolution, 1776 worldwide.
[02:57:40.700 --> 02:57:45.700]  Hour number four with Ali Alexander and Owen Shroyer. Only minutes away. Spread those lengths.
[02:57:45.700 --> 02:57:50.700]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide. Thanks for holding.
[02:57:50.700 --> 02:57:55.700]  Hey, Alex, mate. I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[02:57:55.700 --> 02:58:00.700]  I remember back when Info Wars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen
[02:58:00.700 --> 02:58:05.700]  and I had to load down the page on my dial-up into there and I thought it was pretty cool
[02:58:05.700 --> 02:58:10.700]  and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests and I've been using your products
[02:58:10.700 --> 02:58:17.700]  since the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the X2, the SuperMail Vitality, the Caveman,
[02:58:17.700 --> 02:58:21.700]  the Real Red Pill, micro-ZX body, it's all amazing. Thank you, brother.
[02:58:21.700 --> 02:58:28.700]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body,
[02:58:28.700 --> 02:58:34.700]  you're detoxing the spirit and it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God
[02:58:34.700 --> 02:58:38.700]  and I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew,
[02:58:38.700 --> 02:58:42.700]  and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[02:58:46.700 --> 02:58:51.700]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products, we have it Info Wars live.
[02:58:51.700 --> 02:58:56.700]  It'd take hours. Michael's the X-plus now has a lower price, it's stronger,
[02:58:56.700 --> 02:59:02.700]  it's the other equation in probiotics, it knocks out the yeast, the mold, the Candida, it's back in stock.
[02:59:02.700 --> 02:59:05.700]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[02:59:05.700 --> 02:59:09.700]  It's got the preguinone, that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body,
[02:59:09.700 --> 02:59:13.700]  then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins, the amino acids, so you can upload it.
[02:59:13.700 --> 02:59:19.700]  Our latest product that goes great with the SuperBlue Colloidal Silver and iodine fortified toothpaste
[02:59:19.700 --> 02:59:24.700]  is SuperBlue Silver Immune Gargle, that's a spray you do, you can also swallow it.
[02:59:24.700 --> 02:59:30.700]  It's a supplement with iodine, super high quality silver and a lot more.
[02:59:30.700 --> 02:59:35.700]  Without you, we couldn't do it, so thank you all for remembering InfoWarsTore.com
[02:59:35.700 --> 02:59:39.700]  and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake
[02:59:39.700 --> 03:00:07.700]  and it's so essential to spread the word. Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[03:00:07.700 --> 03:00:19.700]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:19.700 --> 03:00:23.700]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[03:00:23.700 --> 03:00:25.700]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[03:00:25.700 --> 03:00:29.700]  You have got Ali Alexander taking over in the next segment with Alan Shroyer,
[03:00:29.700 --> 03:00:36.700]  but I wanted to spend some time here talking about an actor, talking about a modern deadbeat,
[03:00:36.700 --> 03:00:44.700]  talking about someone that is a puppet that basically just reads the words that someone else feeds to them.
[03:00:44.700 --> 03:00:50.700]  And that's Robert DeNiro, a has been actor for at least a decade,
[03:00:50.700 --> 03:00:56.700]  who has spent every waking hour attacking President Trump
[03:00:56.700 --> 03:01:00.700]  and talking about how he wants to punch him in the nose, talking about how he's a piece of crap,
[03:01:00.700 --> 03:01:07.700]  talking about how he's a racist, how he's a piece of garbage when Trump is trying to get rid of minimum sentencing
[03:01:07.700 --> 03:01:11.700]  where they give black people three times the time in prison for the same amount of cocaine as a white person.
[03:01:11.700 --> 03:01:13.700]  Trump is trying to get rid of that.
[03:01:13.700 --> 03:01:18.700]  Trump is telling the states to, you know, they can decriminalize marijuana and tell them the feds to stop enforcing it.
[03:01:18.700 --> 03:01:20.700]  Boom, Obama promised to do that and never did it.
[03:01:20.700 --> 03:01:23.700]  Trump is taking care of the veterans, securing the borders.
[03:01:23.700 --> 03:01:24.700]  The economy has come back.
[03:01:24.700 --> 03:01:26.700]  4% growth rate is about to be announced.
[03:01:26.700 --> 03:01:29.700]  He's getting peace deals with North Korea.
[03:01:29.700 --> 03:01:31.700]  I could go on for hours and hours.
[03:01:31.700 --> 03:01:38.700]  We've got all these tariffs deals with our 250, 300%, 100%, 200%, some percent on cars, milk, you name it.
[03:01:38.700 --> 03:01:40.700]  And Trump says, no, this is stopping.
[03:01:40.700 --> 03:01:47.700]  China is not going to have a $900 billion trade deficit with us, you know, where they get $900 billion a year and we don't.
[03:01:47.700 --> 03:01:50.700]  The days of selling America out are over.
[03:01:50.700 --> 03:01:54.700]  But the coastal elites, for some reason, hate the rest of the country.
[03:01:54.700 --> 03:01:55.700]  They hate their own nation.
[03:01:55.700 --> 03:01:57.700]  They've been trained to do it in the universities.
[03:01:57.700 --> 03:01:59.700]  They've been trained to hate families. They've been trained to hate God.
[03:01:59.700 --> 03:02:06.700]  This is the sickness that the Robert Barons of finance tried to bring America down 100 years ago and they almost did it.
[03:02:06.700 --> 03:02:12.700]  But then Robert De Niro comes out here in the Tony Awards that have record low ratings like the NFL, like Hollywood.
[03:02:12.700 --> 03:02:15.700]  And they've got all these articles out there.
[03:02:15.700 --> 03:02:16.700]  I heard Owen talking about it earlier.
[03:02:16.700 --> 03:02:22.700]  You know, they've got Atlantic Monthly and Esquire saying that, you know, Trump's family is dead inside.
[03:02:22.700 --> 03:02:23.700]  He's dead inside.
[03:02:23.700 --> 03:02:25.700]  No, Trump's alive.
[03:02:25.700 --> 03:02:27.700]  He's electric and he's delivering.
[03:02:27.700 --> 03:02:31.700]  And the age of betrayal, it looks like might be in trouble right now.
[03:02:31.700 --> 03:02:35.700]  And the age of straight shooting looks like starting to dawn here, doesn't it?
[03:02:35.700 --> 03:02:38.700]  And the prosperity is coming back the instant we do it.
[03:02:38.700 --> 03:02:40.700]  So they don't know what to do.
[03:02:40.700 --> 03:02:48.700]  Robert De Niro says, F Trump at Tony Awards to virtue signal in his own weird bubble, his own sick collapsing bubble.
[03:02:48.700 --> 03:02:50.700]  This is Weinstein's best buddy.
[03:02:50.700 --> 03:02:58.700]  This is, you know, best buddies with this whole decaying edifice with the Jeffrey Epstein's the world that's collapsing.
[03:02:58.700 --> 03:03:09.700]  And then all he can do now is sit there and say, F Trump, F this American, F this real guy, real guy from Brooklyn, real guy from Queens,
[03:03:09.700 --> 03:03:16.700]  this real American tough guy who doesn't act like he's tough, but he is tough and he delivers on being tough.
[03:03:16.700 --> 03:03:21.700]  So this is the virtues signaling when he's on hanging around with the high priestess of Alistair Crowley.
[03:03:21.700 --> 03:03:24.700]  These people are a joke.
[03:03:24.700 --> 03:03:29.700]  And look, I'm not against Robert De Niro because his dad was gay or the word is that, you know, De Niro, whatever.
[03:03:29.700 --> 03:03:35.700]  I know they're blackmailing De Niro over stuff, even tried to do a good thing exposing vaccines and then got scared and backed off.
[03:03:35.700 --> 03:03:41.700]  The truth is he's just a scared little man running around, you know, there's Alistair Crowley events and, you know, all the rest of it.
[03:03:41.700 --> 03:03:43.700]  And, you know, and I think, you know, he should be proud of his dad.
[03:03:43.700 --> 03:03:45.700]  He should be proud of his own sexuality, right, Robert?
[03:03:45.700 --> 03:03:49.700]  So we understand he's been blackmailed and it's okay to come out, Robert.
[03:03:49.700 --> 03:03:54.700]  So let's go ahead now, ladies and gentlemen, and play him saying F the president.
[03:03:54.700 --> 03:03:57.700]  Here's the little scared actor reading off a teleprompter.
[03:03:57.700 --> 03:04:02.700]  Oh, God, what a virtue signal.
[03:04:02.700 --> 03:04:06.700]  Oh, man.
[03:04:06.700 --> 03:04:10.700]  Oh, man.
[03:04:10.700 --> 03:04:11.700]  Oh, yeah.
[03:04:11.700 --> 03:04:15.700]  Oh, God, what a virtue signal.
[03:04:15.700 --> 03:04:18.700]  Oh, oh, man.
[03:04:18.700 --> 03:04:20.700]  Oh, man.
[03:04:20.700 --> 03:04:21.700]  Oh, yeah.
[03:04:21.700 --> 03:04:22.700]  Oh, yeah.
[03:04:22.700 --> 03:04:23.700]  Oh, yeah.
[03:04:23.700 --> 03:04:28.700]  Oh, yeah, we'll tell you FM Hollywood, we're dying, we're collapsing.

[03:06:18.700 --> 03:06:27.700]  The next level of this war is the economic fight.
[03:06:27.700 --> 03:06:35.700]  You need to make sure that you're spending your dollars with the right people.
[03:06:35.700 --> 03:06:36.700]  What am I talking about?
[03:06:36.700 --> 03:06:39.700]  Don't go see the big Hollywood films.
[03:06:39.700 --> 03:06:41.700]  Don't go see the Robert De Niro films.
[03:06:41.700 --> 03:06:44.700]  Don't spend your money on Amazon.
[03:06:44.700 --> 03:06:48.700]  Don't spend your money on CNN sponsors.
[03:06:48.700 --> 03:06:51.700]  This is how we win.
[03:06:51.700 --> 03:06:53.700]  This is how we break their backs.
[03:06:53.700 --> 03:06:57.700]  We've already got the cultural victories happening and the momentum going there,
[03:06:57.700 --> 03:07:02.700]  but now we need to realize the next level of this, which is the economic victories,
[03:07:02.700 --> 03:07:06.700]  break their backs economically, force them to change their public policy,
[03:07:06.700 --> 03:07:14.700]  or drive them out of existence by not spending your dollars with the anti-American people out there like Robert De Niro.
[03:07:14.700 --> 03:07:18.700]  So the next time Robert De Niro has a film come out, you don't go see it.
[03:07:18.700 --> 03:07:22.700]  That's how you send the next message to these people.
[03:07:22.700 --> 03:07:29.700]  Now, Ali Alexander joins me from AmericanPriority.com, a new website that he's just launched as well.
[03:07:29.700 --> 03:07:33.700]  Now, Ali, the last time you were on with Alex, I thought that you were doing...
[03:07:33.700 --> 03:07:38.700]  I just really liked the topic of discussion and it's about...
[03:07:38.700 --> 03:07:43.700]  I don't know how to say it. People say cuck servatives or whatever it is,
[03:07:43.700 --> 03:07:49.700]  but to me it's just about understanding the difference between somebody who just wants to be in the media
[03:07:49.700 --> 03:07:53.700]  because that's what they like to do and see their face on TV and take the selfies
[03:07:53.700 --> 03:07:58.700]  and get a bunch of social media following versus the people that are actually in this to change the world.
[03:07:58.700 --> 03:08:03.700]  And I think that for me, this is something I don't engage in infighting.
[03:08:03.700 --> 03:08:07.700]  I don't like pointing the fingers. That's not something I've never really been into that.
[03:08:07.700 --> 03:08:13.700]  But I'm kind of seeing it happen now where it's like people need to understand we have to push to the next level.
[03:08:13.700 --> 03:08:16.700]  We can't get satisfied. We can't be satisfied.
[03:08:16.700 --> 03:08:19.700]  Now, we need to get more driven. We need to get more hungry.
[03:08:19.700 --> 03:08:23.700]  And I don't like seeing certain members of, we'll say the MAGA movement,
[03:08:23.700 --> 03:08:26.700]  kind of sitting back on their heels now, just kind of getting into a comfort zone.
[03:08:26.700 --> 03:08:30.700]  I think it's now time to get out of the comfort zone, get even more uncomfortable
[03:08:30.700 --> 03:08:32.700]  and push these people back even further.
[03:08:32.700 --> 03:08:35.700]  But Ali Alexander, what's your take on that?
[03:08:35.700 --> 03:08:38.700]  We have to lean in. You're absolutely right.
[03:08:38.700 --> 03:08:41.700]  When I started calling some of these people, we need to stop calling them never Trumpers
[03:08:41.700 --> 03:08:46.700]  because these people haven't just positioned themselves against the president,
[03:08:46.700 --> 03:08:48.700]  the duly elected president of the United States.
[03:08:48.700 --> 03:08:51.700]  They've positioned themselves against people like you and me.
[03:08:51.700 --> 03:08:55.700]  They've positioned themselves against the millions of viewers in Infowars.
[03:08:55.700 --> 03:08:57.700]  They've partnered with people on the left.
[03:08:57.700 --> 03:09:01.700]  They're cheering on a war with North Korea.
[03:09:01.700 --> 03:09:04.700]  They're cheering on treaties that hurt American workers.
[03:09:04.700 --> 03:09:07.700]  I mean, these people are, now I started calling them the orthodoxers
[03:09:07.700 --> 03:09:11.700]  because they go around doxing people and they're these legalist people
[03:09:11.700 --> 03:09:14.700]  who want to push, you know, they're not even conservative policies.
[03:09:14.700 --> 03:09:17.700]  I don't know what they're doing, but I think you hit the nail on the head.
[03:09:17.700 --> 03:09:19.700]  You know, fame is poison.
[03:09:19.700 --> 03:09:21.700]  Jesus said the love of money.
[03:09:21.700 --> 03:09:24.700]  He didn't say money, but the love of money is the root of all evil.
[03:09:24.700 --> 03:09:28.700]  And these people, their priorities, my principles are all out of whack.
[03:09:28.700 --> 03:09:31.700]  Well, and let's be clear too, when we play the clip of Robert De Niro,
[03:09:31.700 --> 03:09:35.700]  Robert De Niro, F Trump, F Trump, ooh, I'm the big tough guy, F Trump.
[03:09:35.700 --> 03:09:37.700]  And then all of Hollywood stands up.
[03:09:37.700 --> 03:09:38.700]  Yeah.
[03:09:38.700 --> 03:09:41.700]  They're not, I mean, okay, they're saying F Trump and they do hate Trump,
[03:09:41.700 --> 03:09:42.700]  but really what are they saying?
[03:09:42.700 --> 03:09:43.700]  They're saying F you.
[03:09:43.700 --> 03:09:47.700]  They're saying F America and they now have this hatred, I think,
[03:09:47.700 --> 03:09:50.700]  because they've been so in control of the narrative.
[03:09:50.700 --> 03:09:54.700]  These people have been so idolized and so worshiped where anything they say
[03:09:54.700 --> 03:09:56.700]  becomes gold and truth and reported.
[03:09:56.700 --> 03:10:01.700]  They had this huge hubris of this control factor and now it's slipping out of their hands.
[03:10:01.700 --> 03:10:05.700]  And the minions, the Americans that they used to control at their beck and call
[03:10:05.700 --> 03:10:08.700]  are kind of turning the other way and ignoring them now.
[03:10:08.700 --> 03:10:11.700]  And you're seeing their hatred and they're like, I hate these Americans.
[03:10:11.700 --> 03:10:12.700]  Why aren't they listening to us?
[03:10:12.700 --> 03:10:13.700]  F Trump.
[03:10:13.700 --> 03:10:18.700]  Ah, and then they all stand up in their, but they're in a little bubble though.
[03:10:18.700 --> 03:10:19.700]  This is not America.
[03:10:19.700 --> 03:10:20.700]  Nobody feels that way.
[03:10:20.700 --> 03:10:21.700]  Yeah.
[03:10:21.700 --> 03:10:22.700]  Yeah.
[03:10:22.700 --> 03:10:23.700]  It's totally feral.
[03:10:23.700 --> 03:10:30.700]  They're like this wild possum or raccoon that cannot help but exert themselves
[03:10:30.700 --> 03:10:33.700]  physically when we're trying to have a debate or discussion.
[03:10:33.700 --> 03:10:37.700]  And it's actually worse than you mentioned, Owen.
[03:10:37.700 --> 03:10:39.700]  It wasn't just F the American people.
[03:10:39.700 --> 03:10:43.700]  It wasn't just F the millions of people who are going to watch this segment across
[03:10:43.700 --> 03:10:47.700]  several different platforms, the platforms that are censoring us, by the way.
[03:10:47.700 --> 03:10:50.700]  But it's also that he was doing a mentalist trick.
[03:10:50.700 --> 03:10:53.700]  So did you notice that De Niro did this twice?
[03:10:53.700 --> 03:10:56.700]  And he was silent until they gave him a standing ovation.
[03:10:56.700 --> 03:11:00.700]  What they wanted to do was identify anyone who was neutral in Hollywood.
[03:11:00.700 --> 03:11:05.700]  They want to kick people out of Hollywood who have no political position.
[03:11:05.700 --> 03:11:06.700]  It was a trick.
[03:11:06.700 --> 03:11:07.700]  Robert De Niro knows this.
[03:11:07.700 --> 03:11:09.700]  He's been in the business for, for decades.
[03:11:09.700 --> 03:11:13.700]  It was a mentalist trick into forcing people to give him a standing ovation.
[03:11:13.700 --> 03:11:16.700]  It was a dirty, dirty, nasty trick.
[03:11:16.700 --> 03:11:20.700]  And I like to tell my viewers on Periscope, there is a they.
[03:11:20.700 --> 03:11:21.700]  There is a they.
[03:11:21.700 --> 03:11:24.700]  We do have oligarchs just like Russia has oligarchs.
[03:11:24.700 --> 03:11:29.700]  It just so happens to be the corporatist inside of America who want us to buy their products,
[03:11:29.700 --> 03:11:32.700]  buy their pills and watch their narrative.
[03:11:32.700 --> 03:11:38.700]  To me, this is like watching the modern day KKK after the slaves refreed.
[03:11:38.700 --> 03:11:43.700]  The KKK started doing more rallies, getting louder, getting angrier, doing more events
[03:11:43.700 --> 03:11:47.700]  in their anger and disgust that the black man was freed.
[03:11:47.700 --> 03:11:49.700]  And so the KKK started doing more public displays.
[03:11:49.700 --> 03:11:51.700]  That's Hollywood right now.
[03:11:51.700 --> 03:11:56.700]  There's slaves, the American people, their minions are free now from their thought control.
[03:11:56.700 --> 03:11:59.700]  And so they're all rioted and raging.
[03:11:59.700 --> 03:12:01.700]  But you know, you just said something incredible.
[03:12:01.700 --> 03:12:03.700]  This is why you're so key in this movement.
[03:12:03.700 --> 03:12:04.700]  I never thought of that.
[03:12:04.700 --> 03:12:09.700]  They're identifying the people in Hollywood that won't go along with their propaganda.
[03:12:09.700 --> 03:12:12.700]  And I actually want the crew to replay this because there's actually a clip.
[03:12:12.700 --> 03:12:13.700]  And you said that.
[03:12:13.700 --> 03:12:14.700]  And then I saw it.
[03:12:14.700 --> 03:12:15.700]  Yeah.
[03:12:15.700 --> 03:12:16.700]  Start this clip over.
[03:12:16.700 --> 03:12:20.700]  There's a moment in this clip where you can see there's a couple people.
[03:12:20.700 --> 03:12:24.700]  There's a couple people, though, in the crowd that are like, they're like, oh my gosh.
[03:12:24.700 --> 03:12:26.700]  Like, really, we're doing this again.
[03:12:26.700 --> 03:12:27.700]  And now they're here.
[03:12:27.700 --> 03:12:30.700]  Wait, I'm going to see if we can pause this at the right frame here, guys,
[03:12:30.700 --> 03:12:35.700]  because there is a actual amazing frame here that you can see exactly what Ally is talking about.
[03:12:35.700 --> 03:12:36.700]  This is incredible right here.
[03:12:36.700 --> 03:12:37.700]  Silence.
[03:12:37.700 --> 03:12:38.700]  Notice the silence for a second.
[03:12:38.700 --> 03:12:39.700]  Okay, he's going to force it.
[03:12:39.700 --> 03:12:40.700]  He's going to force it.
[03:12:40.700 --> 03:12:41.700]  He didn't get what he wanted.
[03:12:41.700 --> 03:12:42.700]  Pause it right there.
[03:12:42.700 --> 03:12:43.700]  Pause it right there.
[03:12:43.700 --> 03:12:44.700]  All right, now look at this.
[03:12:44.700 --> 03:12:46.700]  See that lady in the background?
[03:12:46.700 --> 03:12:48.700]  She's going to get kicked out of Hollywood.
[03:12:48.700 --> 03:12:51.700]  See that other guy that's looking up like he's tired of this crap?
[03:12:51.700 --> 03:12:53.700]  He's going to get kicked out of Hollywood.
[03:12:53.700 --> 03:12:55.700]  You are, this is incredible.
[03:12:55.700 --> 03:13:00.700]  They are identifying the people that they want a black ball from Hollywood with this crap.
[03:13:00.700 --> 03:13:01.700]  Yeah.
[03:13:01.700 --> 03:13:03.700]  It's really bad, Owen.
[03:13:03.700 --> 03:13:06.700]  And now I go out to LA about once every month and a half.
[03:13:06.700 --> 03:13:10.700]  And I want to tell you there are voices inside of the recording industry.
[03:13:10.700 --> 03:13:13.700]  There are voices inside of Hollywood who are tired of this.
[03:13:13.700 --> 03:13:18.700]  And unfortunately, you know, we can't talk about them too much, but there are famous
[03:13:18.700 --> 03:13:23.700]  people in Silicon Valley, there are famous people in Hollywood who want to be free from
[03:13:23.700 --> 03:13:26.700]  this mental prison that Kanye talked about.
[03:13:26.700 --> 03:13:31.700]  And many reached out to, many have been talking to me for over a year, but after Kanye West,
[03:13:31.700 --> 03:13:33.700]  I was his first two retweets.
[03:13:33.700 --> 03:13:37.700]  They reached out even more and it's really dirty what they're doing.
[03:13:37.700 --> 03:13:39.700]  And my mom has a background in psychology.
[03:13:39.700 --> 03:13:41.700]  I was always going to class with her.
[03:13:41.700 --> 03:13:46.700]  And this is one of those tricks that I learned is you can use silence to force an applause
[03:13:46.700 --> 03:13:48.700]  on a bad line.
[03:13:48.700 --> 03:13:52.700]  And Robert De Niro just did a classic mentalist trick in forcing that.
[03:13:52.700 --> 03:13:55.700]  But you're so keen that you caught that because I wasn't even going to bring that up.
[03:13:55.700 --> 03:13:58.700]  But I caught that last night that that woman was horrified.
[03:13:58.700 --> 03:14:00.700]  And I can't believe that you actually noticed that.
[03:14:00.700 --> 03:14:03.700]  But there's a chilling effect going on on Hollywood.
[03:14:03.700 --> 03:14:05.700]  And here's the math of it, Owen.
[03:14:05.700 --> 03:14:13.700]  If the media isn't happy with 90%, why does the media need 99.9% control?
[03:14:13.700 --> 03:14:15.700]  Why isn't 90% control good enough?
[03:14:15.700 --> 03:14:17.700]  Why isn't 80% control good enough?
[03:14:17.700 --> 03:14:23.700]  And that tells you there's not a constituency for their blank.
[03:14:23.700 --> 03:14:26.700]  I'll leave it at that blank since we're broadcasting all over America.
[03:14:26.700 --> 03:14:29.700]  Well, and it's a totalitarian thing is what it is.
[03:14:29.700 --> 03:14:31.700]  It has to be a totalitarian thing.
[03:14:31.700 --> 03:14:38.700]  But there's a veil or a facade of Hollywood that these are the happiest people on Earth.
[03:14:38.700 --> 03:14:41.700]  These are the freest people on Earth, the rich, the famous, all great.
[03:14:41.700 --> 03:14:46.700]  No, a lot of these people are probably very unhappy, but more than anything, they're controlled.
[03:14:46.700 --> 03:14:50.700]  And that's what I think a lot of people don't understand how controlled Hollywood actors are.
[03:14:50.700 --> 03:14:54.700]  They just assume because they're rich and famous that they live the most happy, free lives.
[03:14:54.700 --> 03:14:55.700]  That's a facade.
[03:14:55.700 --> 03:14:56.700]  That's fake.
[03:14:56.700 --> 03:14:57.700]  A lot of these people are controlled.
[03:14:57.700 --> 03:14:58.700]  They got bills.
[03:14:58.700 --> 03:15:00.700]  They got mortgages.
[03:15:00.700 --> 03:15:02.700]  I mean, so they got to work for a living.
[03:15:02.700 --> 03:15:06.700]  And I think a lot of these people are so scared to lose their job because they have to pay for whatever big homes they have.
[03:15:06.700 --> 03:15:08.700]  And that's why they don't step out.
[03:15:08.700 --> 03:15:12.700]  But I think more so, people are realizing that you do step out.
[03:15:12.700 --> 03:15:14.700]  You actually gain popularity.
[03:15:14.700 --> 03:15:16.700]  Yeah, that's the truth.
[03:15:16.700 --> 03:15:18.700]  And you're watching a lot of people go independent.
[03:15:18.700 --> 03:15:22.700]  This was supposed to be the promise of YouTube and other platforms.
[03:15:22.700 --> 03:15:28.700]  And this is why YouTube is moving to YouTube red because the industry people, when they got into these startups,
[03:15:28.700 --> 03:15:34.700]  wanted to be more like the intellectual ghettos that they had built on terrestrial stations.
[03:15:34.700 --> 03:15:37.700]  And so, you know, this is entirely predictable what they're doing.
[03:15:37.700 --> 03:15:40.700]  The totalitarianism that you're talking about is a natural symptom.
[03:15:40.700 --> 03:15:41.700]  I guess we're about to go to break.
[03:15:41.700 --> 03:15:43.700]  But I can't wait to continue for the next 45 minutes.
[03:15:43.700 --> 03:15:45.700]  Have Trump. Have Trump.
[03:15:45.700 --> 03:15:47.700]  He's not standing in a boarding.
[03:15:47.700 --> 03:15:48.700]  Kick him out.
[03:15:48.700 --> 03:15:50.700]  She's not standing in a boarding.
[03:15:50.700 --> 03:15:51.700]  Kick them out.
[03:15:51.700 --> 03:15:52.700]  They don't hate Trump.
[03:15:52.700 --> 03:15:58.700]  Health care reform is confusing, but whether it's finding an affordable insurance plan, keeping your doctor,
[03:15:58.700 --> 03:16:03.700]  or being able to afford needed prescriptions, navigating the health care system has become a challenge.

[03:20:28.700 --> 03:20:35.700]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[03:20:35.700 --> 03:20:38.700]  You know, I think Johnny Cash.
[03:20:38.700 --> 03:20:40.700]  Johnny Cash is actually my favorite artist.
[03:20:40.700 --> 03:20:49.700]  I think Johnny Cash did a rendition of that song to get with the staff and see who that artist was and whether that was a rendition or the original.
[03:20:49.700 --> 03:20:53.700]  You're back listening to the Alex Jones show here on Info Wars.
[03:20:53.700 --> 03:20:56.700]  I'm the guest host for this bottom hour.
[03:20:56.700 --> 03:20:57.700]  My name is Ali Alexander.
[03:20:57.700 --> 03:21:00.700]  You can find me at twitter, twitter.com, slash Ali.
[03:21:00.700 --> 03:21:08.700]  You know, we just got through talking with Owen about Mr. Robert De Niro with a lot of secrets in his closet.
[03:21:08.700 --> 03:21:12.700]  But you see, Hollywood and the media are a part of the same beast.
[03:21:12.700 --> 03:21:14.700]  This is a hydra that we're facing.
[03:21:14.700 --> 03:21:18.700]  I was on Periscope last night and I made this list for you all.
[03:21:18.700 --> 03:21:21.700]  I made this list of just the past 72 hours.
[03:21:21.700 --> 03:21:23.700]  Let's think about what the media has done.
[03:21:23.700 --> 03:21:30.700]  Remember, the president called the media, the fake news media, the enemies of the people.
[03:21:30.700 --> 03:21:37.700]  And I have a lot of friends in the press and I started thinking about this and I said, you know, do we really want to use that type of language?
[03:21:37.700 --> 03:21:39.700]  And I visited the Constitution.
[03:21:39.700 --> 03:21:41.700]  I remember there being a free press.
[03:21:41.700 --> 03:21:44.700]  Free press in the first amendment.
[03:21:44.700 --> 03:21:50.700]  And I did this thought exercise where I said, okay, well, is corporate media a free press?
[03:21:50.700 --> 03:21:51.700]  And I don't think it is.
[03:21:51.700 --> 03:21:55.700]  So let's go through a couple of examples of what's happened and we're going to take calls.
[03:21:55.700 --> 03:21:57.700]  So I'm going to give the number here in a little bit.
[03:21:57.700 --> 03:21:58.700]  You grab a number.
[03:21:58.700 --> 03:21:59.700]  You grab a pen.
[03:21:59.700 --> 03:22:01.700]  We're going to give the number out in a little bit.
[03:22:01.700 --> 03:22:02.700]  But let's go through these examples.
[03:22:02.700 --> 03:22:14.700]  One, BuzzFeed's editor-in-chief has admitted that he knew that his reporter was sleeping with someone on the select Senate committee of intelligence.
[03:22:14.700 --> 03:22:15.700]  Okay.
[03:22:15.700 --> 03:22:25.700]  So there was a BuzzFeed reporter who now works at the New York Times who was sleeping with her source in exchange for information, classified information, highly illegal.
[03:22:25.700 --> 03:22:29.700]  Thank goodness the Department of Justice has charged this man.
[03:22:29.700 --> 03:22:32.700]  But BuzzFeed then says, that's okay.
[03:22:32.700 --> 03:22:34.700]  We don't need journalistic standards.
[03:22:34.700 --> 03:22:36.700]  So there's a new standard.
[03:22:36.700 --> 03:22:39.700]  Second on our list is the G7 meeting.
[03:22:39.700 --> 03:22:41.700]  How about that G7 meeting?
[03:22:41.700 --> 03:22:46.700]  So Donald Trump goes in the G7 meeting and he says, you know, I want fairer deals.
[03:22:46.700 --> 03:22:49.700]  If you're going to have tariffs, we're going to have tariffs.
[03:22:49.700 --> 03:22:57.700]  He says America first, you know, you guys can still run the run the game on us, but it needs to be a little more fair.
[03:22:57.700 --> 03:22:59.700]  Media freaks out.
[03:22:59.700 --> 03:23:02.700]  Donald Trump comes out the next hour and he says, you know what?
[03:23:02.700 --> 03:23:06.700]  If we all got rid of our tariffs, then we could have total free trade.
[03:23:06.700 --> 03:23:13.700]  So the president demonstrated using a technique in the art of the war that the other side doesn't actually want a deal.
[03:23:13.700 --> 03:23:15.700]  They don't want a deal.
[03:23:15.700 --> 03:23:19.700]  The media is quite literally not pushing an agenda, not a partisan agenda.
[03:23:19.700 --> 03:23:23.700]  They're not pushing for fair trade and they're not pushing for free trade.
[03:23:23.700 --> 03:23:31.700]  They're pushing for our opponents, our adversaries, our allies to eat our lunch.
[03:23:31.700 --> 03:23:32.700]  And I'll tell you why.
[03:23:32.700 --> 03:23:33.700]  You want to know the secret why?
[03:23:33.700 --> 03:23:36.700]  The secret why is they don't want votes in Ohio.
[03:23:36.700 --> 03:23:38.700]  They don't want votes in Pennsylvania.
[03:23:38.700 --> 03:23:40.700]  They don't want votes in West Virginia.
[03:23:40.700 --> 03:23:49.700]  They want to see the Rust Belt continue its migration to the South so that they can make those swing states.
[03:23:49.700 --> 03:23:52.700]  They don't want Donald Trump to ever win Pennsylvania again.
[03:23:52.700 --> 03:23:57.700]  They don't want a Republican to have a chance at getting Ohio.
[03:23:57.700 --> 03:24:00.700]  They don't want West Virginia solidly in the red column.
[03:24:00.700 --> 03:24:02.700]  This is a game of math.
[03:24:02.700 --> 03:24:05.700]  Third, they're rooting for war with North Korea.
[03:24:05.700 --> 03:24:07.700]  You can't make this up.
[03:24:07.700 --> 03:24:09.700]  You cannot make this up.
[03:24:09.700 --> 03:24:14.700]  The press's coverage is about Kim Jong-un's toilet.
[03:24:14.700 --> 03:24:22.700]  And the first question when President Trump was meeting with Prime Minister Lee of Singapore was,
[03:24:22.700 --> 03:24:25.700]  didn't you say this was a topsy-turvy world?
[03:24:25.700 --> 03:24:27.700]  You cannot make this up.
[03:24:27.700 --> 03:24:32.700]  They don't want peace with North Korea because that would be a political victory for the president.
[03:24:32.700 --> 03:24:34.700]  You cannot make this up.
[03:24:34.700 --> 03:24:44.700]  The anti-war press, the supposedly so-called anti-war press, is pushing for war with North Korea.
[03:24:44.700 --> 03:24:47.700]  They do not want a unified peninsula.
[03:24:47.700 --> 03:24:52.700]  They want Guam and Japan under constant threat and stress.
[03:24:52.700 --> 03:24:55.700]  And this one's my favorite.
[03:24:55.700 --> 03:25:00.700]  The press has spent the better part of three decades making fun of Donald Trump's hair.
[03:25:00.700 --> 03:25:04.700]  They stepped this into overdrive when he started running as a Republican,
[03:25:04.700 --> 03:25:07.700]  super overdrive when he became president,
[03:25:07.700 --> 03:25:13.700]  but nary a mention when the Canadian Prime Minister glues on,
[03:25:13.700 --> 03:25:15.700]  gorilla glues on his eyebrows.
[03:25:15.700 --> 03:25:17.700]  You cannot make this up.
[03:25:17.700 --> 03:25:21.700]  I was complaining on my periscope last night that I must be living in La La Land.
[03:25:21.700 --> 03:25:25.700]  The press is entirely acting like enemies of the people.
[03:25:25.700 --> 03:25:26.700]  They want war.
[03:25:26.700 --> 03:25:30.700]  They don't want a trade deal, not a fair trade one, not a free trade one,
[03:25:30.700 --> 03:25:32.700]  nothing that had Donald Trump's name on it.
[03:25:32.700 --> 03:25:34.700]  They're yelling F Trump.
[03:25:34.700 --> 03:25:37.700]  They can't name a single thing they hate about Trump.
[03:25:37.700 --> 03:25:43.700]  They're sleeping with their sources in exchange for classified information.
[03:25:43.700 --> 03:25:49.700]  Let's not forget that they outed Israel when Israel had subverted and got into ISIS.
[03:25:49.700 --> 03:25:52.700]  They had chilled relations with the UK.
[03:25:52.700 --> 03:25:53.700]  This was all last year.
[03:25:53.700 --> 03:25:56.700]  I mean, literally, we're living in La La Land.
[03:25:56.700 --> 03:25:58.700]  We're living in La La Land.
[03:25:58.700 --> 03:26:03.700]  This guy is copy and pasting on his eyebrows.
[03:26:03.700 --> 03:26:04.700]  You can't make this up.
[03:26:04.700 --> 03:26:08.700]  Let me give you guys the number so we can start getting you guys in the queue.
[03:26:08.700 --> 03:26:13.700]  This number is going to be 877-789-2539.
[03:26:13.700 --> 03:26:17.700]  That number is 877-789-Alex.
[03:26:17.700 --> 03:26:20.700]  If you want to talk to me, we're going to talk about media.
[03:26:20.700 --> 03:26:22.700]  I want to talk about media reform.
[03:26:22.700 --> 03:26:26.700]  I want to go through the past year and a half of media craziness.
[03:26:26.700 --> 03:26:33.700]  I want you guys to ask, because we're definitely going to talk about this after this next segment of how do we step it up?
[03:26:33.700 --> 03:26:35.700]  Owen really touched on this.
[03:26:35.700 --> 03:26:39.700]  We can't afford to just complain on Twitter and Facebook anymore.
[03:26:39.700 --> 03:26:41.700]  We got to have skin in the game.
[03:26:41.700 --> 03:26:44.700]  We have to understand that commerce is speech.
[03:26:44.700 --> 03:26:48.700]  We can't be frequenting those people who want us.
[03:26:48.700 --> 03:26:50.700]  They don't want us to bake the cake.
[03:26:50.700 --> 03:26:56.700]  They want us to decorate the cake, but not their allies, not their other religious allies on the left.
[03:26:56.700 --> 03:26:57.700]  No, no, no, no.
[03:26:57.700 --> 03:27:06.700]  This is entirely a plan to keep us from breeding, to keep us out of the marketplace of ideas, to keep us out of commerce.
[03:27:06.700 --> 03:27:12.700]  And then, as you're seeing with this deep state plot, this Russia hoax, to keep us from serving our government,
[03:27:12.700 --> 03:27:22.700]  there is nothing short of a plan to minimize half of the United States views in the marketplace, in any part of the marketplace.
[03:27:22.700 --> 03:27:26.700]  So 877-789-2539, you're going to be on hold.
[03:27:26.700 --> 03:27:30.700]  The producers are going to do a great job of getting me those names.
[03:27:30.700 --> 03:27:31.700]  And I want to talk to you guys.
[03:27:31.700 --> 03:27:33.700]  I want to talk to you guys about what's going on.
[03:27:33.700 --> 03:27:35.700]  But I just, I honestly can't believe this.
[03:27:35.700 --> 03:27:41.700]  I honestly cannot believe that we're living in an age where usually this is what happens.
[03:27:41.700 --> 03:27:43.700]  You know, you don't want to be a shill, right?
[03:27:43.700 --> 03:27:47.700]  You don't want to say, well, Donald Trump is right about everything.
[03:27:47.700 --> 03:27:56.700]  But it's getting really, really difficult when not only the press is doing evil things, bad things, anti-American things,
[03:27:56.700 --> 03:28:02.700]  promoting the Steve Scalise shooter, promoting BAM, by any means necessary, promoting Antifa.
[03:28:02.700 --> 03:28:04.700]  They're not just radicalizing the left.
[03:28:04.700 --> 03:28:10.700]  They're not just running coups on us, but they're refusing to speak out against their colleagues
[03:28:10.700 --> 03:28:13.700]  when they violate journalistic principles.
[03:28:13.700 --> 03:28:16.700]  You cannot make this up.
[03:28:16.700 --> 03:28:18.700]  We are living in a Cold Civil War.
[03:28:18.700 --> 03:28:23.700]  We are living in a hashtag, Cold Civil War.
[03:28:23.700 --> 03:28:25.700]  And I pray that it doesn't warm.
[03:28:25.700 --> 03:28:26.700]  That's what we're trying to do here.
[03:28:26.700 --> 03:28:28.700]  That's why I'm here on InfoWars.
[03:28:28.700 --> 03:28:30.700]  We have to warn people.
[03:28:30.700 --> 03:28:31.700]  We're going to be back after the breaks.
[03:28:31.700 --> 03:28:36.700]  We're going to take your calls, 877-789-ALEX.
[03:28:36.700 --> 03:28:39.700]  And I'm really excited to take this war to the media.
[03:28:39.700 --> 03:28:43.700]  We really, truly, truly, truly are the Resistance.
[03:28:43.700 --> 03:28:45.700]  Stay tuned, click share.
[03:28:45.700 --> 03:29:14.700]  We appreciate you.

[03:30:20.700 --> 03:30:22.700]  Now, because of their intensifying censorship,
[03:30:22.700 --> 03:30:24.700]  it's more important than ever
[03:30:24.700 --> 03:30:27.700]  that everyone go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter
[03:30:27.700 --> 03:30:29.700]  and sign up via email
[03:30:29.700 --> 03:30:31.700]  so there's no way the censors can get between us
[03:30:31.700 --> 03:30:35.700]  with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[03:30:35.700 --> 03:30:37.700]  And so now I ask you more than ever
[03:30:37.700 --> 03:30:41.700]  to share the infowars.com articles, to share the videos,
[03:30:41.700 --> 03:30:43.700]  to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[03:30:43.700 --> 03:30:45.700]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up
[03:30:45.700 --> 03:30:50.700]  for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[03:30:50.700 --> 03:30:53.700]  We are the Renaissance, and we are winning.
[03:30:53.700 --> 03:30:57.700]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia,
[03:30:57.700 --> 03:30:59.700]  you're on the air worldwide. Thanks for holding.
[03:30:59.700 --> 03:31:00.700]  Hey, Alex, mate.
[03:31:00.700 --> 03:31:04.700]  I've been following you since I was 14, and I'm 32 now.
[03:31:04.700 --> 03:31:07.700]  I remember back when info wars and prison planet,
[03:31:07.700 --> 03:31:09.700]  it was just blue text on a white screen
[03:31:09.700 --> 03:31:12.700]  and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet
[03:31:12.700 --> 03:31:15.700]  and I thought it was pretty cool and read all the books
[03:31:15.700 --> 03:31:17.700]  and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests.
[03:31:17.700 --> 03:31:20.700]  And I've been using your products since the first iteration
[03:31:20.700 --> 03:31:23.700]  of Survival Shield, and since then I'm on the X2,
[03:31:23.700 --> 03:31:27.700]  the Super Male Vitality, the caveman, the real red pill,
[03:31:27.700 --> 03:31:29.700]  micro-ZX body, it's all amazing.
[03:31:29.700 --> 03:31:30.700]  Thank you, brother.
[03:31:30.700 --> 03:31:33.700]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much,
[03:31:33.700 --> 03:31:37.700]  it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body,
[03:31:37.700 --> 03:31:40.700]  you're detoxing the spirit, and it's just the more you know God,
[03:31:40.700 --> 03:31:43.700]  the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[03:31:43.700 --> 03:31:46.700]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side-by-side
[03:31:46.700 --> 03:31:48.700]  with you, the crew, and the listeners out there,
[03:31:48.700 --> 03:31:50.700]  1776 worldwide.
[03:31:53.700 --> 03:31:57.700]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:31:57.700 --> 03:32:00.700]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates,
[03:32:00.700 --> 03:32:03.700]  but a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater
[03:32:03.700 --> 03:32:06.700]  and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:32:06.700 --> 03:32:10.700]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles,
[03:32:10.700 --> 03:32:14.700]  and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:32:14.700 --> 03:32:18.700]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals,
[03:32:18.700 --> 03:32:20.700]  alkalinity, and pH.
[03:32:20.700 --> 03:32:23.700]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels
[03:32:23.700 --> 03:32:26.700]  of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:32:26.700 --> 03:32:30.700]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure Gravity Filter,
[03:32:30.700 --> 03:32:33.700]  and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure,
[03:32:33.700 --> 03:32:37.700]  but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:32:37.700 --> 03:32:42.700]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:32:42.700 --> 03:32:46.700]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain
[03:32:46.700 --> 03:32:48.700]  can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:32:48.700 --> 03:33:04.700]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:33:19.700 --> 03:33:25.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:25.700 --> 03:33:27.700]  We're coming in live.
[03:33:27.700 --> 03:33:30.700]  Thank you for tuning into the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:30.700 --> 03:33:35.700]  I am Ollie Alexander, a GOP operative, turned philosopher,
[03:33:35.700 --> 03:33:37.700]  and I want to talk to everyone.
[03:33:37.700 --> 03:33:40.700]  I want to talk to everyone, and I'm so glad to be with you guys.
[03:33:40.700 --> 03:33:44.700]  You know, I'm told that there's free shipping at the Infowars Store.
[03:33:44.700 --> 03:33:47.700]  You know, I have never myself shopped at the Infowars Store,
[03:33:47.700 --> 03:33:49.700]  but maybe I'll have them send me something.
[03:33:49.700 --> 03:33:54.700]  They are about to end their super summer sale, free shipping, 50% off.
[03:33:54.700 --> 03:33:56.700]  If you want to buy something, this is what I told them.
[03:33:56.700 --> 03:33:59.700]  They said, you know, Ollie, do you want to talk about our products or not?
[03:33:59.700 --> 03:34:05.700]  And I said, absolutely, I believe that we should support those who support us.
[03:34:05.700 --> 03:34:08.700]  We have to start building our own marketplaces,
[03:34:08.700 --> 03:34:11.700]  and this is going to include supplements, vitamins.
[03:34:11.700 --> 03:34:13.700]  This is going to include water filters.
[03:34:13.700 --> 03:34:16.700]  This is going to eventually include clothes, and it's going to be everyone.
[03:34:16.700 --> 03:34:18.700]  It's going to be a federated future.
[03:34:18.700 --> 03:34:19.700]  I talk about this a lot.
[03:34:19.700 --> 03:34:23.700]  In fact, I talk about this in a philosophical speech that I recently published.
[03:34:23.700 --> 03:34:30.700]  It's called Entering the Based Era, and it talks about how we can all live peacefully, liberals,
[03:34:30.700 --> 03:34:35.700]  progressives, conservatives, libertarians, whatever, Infowars viewers, democracy now viewers.
[03:34:35.700 --> 03:34:41.700]  We can live peacefully if we're willing to say, okay, well, not everything needs to be political.
[03:34:41.700 --> 03:34:44.700]  You know, we don't need a bowel before our oligarchs.
[03:34:44.700 --> 03:34:47.700]  So they're showing right now there's the text of the speech.
[03:34:47.700 --> 03:34:48.700]  It's an 11-minute video.
[03:34:48.700 --> 03:34:52.700]  It will change your life, but support those who support you.
[03:34:52.700 --> 03:34:58.700]  You can go to the Infowars store and, you know, you only have a little bit of time to get that free shipping.
[03:34:58.700 --> 03:35:02.700]  So there's a plug for my friends, and I appreciate having this platform.
[03:35:02.700 --> 03:35:04.700]  You know, we're talking about media.
[03:35:04.700 --> 03:35:12.700]  We're talking about how they are actually our oligarchs, that this is, see, if you control speech, you control thought.
[03:35:12.700 --> 03:35:19.700]  And I'm going to be coming back on Infowars to introduce some new stuff that they've never done on Infowars.
[03:35:19.700 --> 03:35:23.700]  So we're going to be doing thought experiments live in the future.
[03:35:23.700 --> 03:35:26.700]  They don't know this yet, but I'm going to pitch this to them.
[03:35:26.700 --> 03:35:33.700]  We're going to do thought experiments live, and I'm going to teach you guys to discover how you're actually being programmed for them.
[03:35:33.700 --> 03:35:39.700]  When they use the word in a headline, controversial, what actually happens in your brain?
[03:35:39.700 --> 03:35:42.700]  Okay, we're going to show you how quotation marks.
[03:35:42.700 --> 03:35:48.700]  If I said, I love you, well, that's a lot different than if I said, I love you with quotations, right?
[03:35:48.700 --> 03:35:54.700]  So I'm going to teach you some of the tricks that I've learned from these nefarious people inside the media.
[03:35:54.700 --> 03:36:01.700]  But first, let's go to Alex in Michigan, a really good call about the Democrats divide and conquer strategy.
[03:36:01.700 --> 03:36:04.700]  Let's talk to Alex in Michigan. How are you, Alex?
[03:36:04.700 --> 03:36:06.700]  Hey, Ali, how's it going, man?
[03:36:06.700 --> 03:36:10.700]  You know, I'm lively. I'm having fun. It's summer.
[03:36:10.700 --> 03:36:14.700]  And, you know, I'm enjoying talking to all of you.
[03:36:14.700 --> 03:36:17.700]  That's great. I just started following you on Periscope.
[03:36:17.700 --> 03:36:18.700]  Thank you.
[03:36:18.700 --> 03:36:21.700]  I'm Ninja Alex 420 on Twitter or whatever.
[03:36:21.700 --> 03:36:25.700]  But yeah, I'd just like to give a plug for the products to you.
[03:36:25.700 --> 03:36:29.700]  The iodine is great. 50% off at the Infowars store.
[03:36:29.700 --> 03:36:32.700]  And I just got the real red pill in the mail.
[03:36:32.700 --> 03:36:36.700]  It's looking forward to feeling the effects of that.
[03:36:36.700 --> 03:36:41.700]  I was going to call in to say that we got it all just come together right now.
[03:36:41.700 --> 03:36:50.700]  And it's all part of the plan is even the WikiLeaks saying that they're trying to divide us by race, gender, all these things.
[03:36:50.700 --> 03:36:56.700]  So we don't come together just as Americans and develop a better country.
[03:36:56.700 --> 03:36:57.700]  Yeah.
[03:36:57.700 --> 03:37:01.700]  Yeah, Alex, I think that you're right. And that's what Kanye is touching on, right?
[03:37:01.700 --> 03:37:03.700]  That's what Roseanne Barr is touching on.
[03:37:03.700 --> 03:37:05.700]  That's what Scott Adams is touching on.
[03:37:05.700 --> 03:37:08.700]  These people are not a part of the traditional right.
[03:37:08.700 --> 03:37:10.700]  Heck, they're not even part of the modern right.
[03:37:10.700 --> 03:37:15.700]  But if we can come together and say, OK, well, we should be able to sell and buy products with each other.
[03:37:15.700 --> 03:37:18.700]  We should be able to come together with Americans.
[03:37:18.700 --> 03:37:21.700]  You and I know, Alex, that most black and white people get along.
[03:37:21.700 --> 03:37:27.700]  So then why is 90% of the media coverage showing us not getting along?
[03:37:27.700 --> 03:37:34.700]  Why do they choose the worst police officers and then the worst black offenders and say this is reflective of the whole?
[03:37:34.700 --> 03:37:37.700]  It's not true. It is a divide and conquer strategy.
[03:37:37.700 --> 03:37:39.700]  It's bigger than the Democrats.
[03:37:39.700 --> 03:37:47.700]  The Democrats just happen to be aligned with these corporate oligarchs on Wall Street, Hollywood, some now in Silicon Valley,
[03:37:47.700 --> 03:37:49.700]  and in parts of the deep state.
[03:37:49.700 --> 03:37:57.700]  I regret that they're once patriots who have turned into these oligarch sith lords.
[03:37:57.700 --> 03:37:59.700]  That's essentially what they've done.
[03:37:59.700 --> 03:38:01.700]  Good call out. Thanks for calling.
[03:38:01.700 --> 03:38:03.700]  Yeah, it's totally true.
[03:38:03.700 --> 03:38:05.700]  Let's go to Steve in Montana.
[03:38:05.700 --> 03:38:07.700]  Let's go to Steve in Montana.
[03:38:07.700 --> 03:38:10.700]  Steve in Montana wants to talk about social media activism.
[03:38:10.700 --> 03:38:13.700]  Today on Twitter, they banned CJ Pearson.
[03:38:13.700 --> 03:38:21.700]  CJ Pearson is like my little brother. He's a 15-year-old, young, educated, black boy out of Augusta, Georgia.
[03:38:21.700 --> 03:38:25.700]  We are fighting really hard, back channeling with Twitter to make sure he gets his account back.
[03:38:25.700 --> 03:38:29.700]  Social media activism is absolutely something we need to talk about.
[03:38:29.700 --> 03:38:31.700]  How are you, Steve?
[03:38:31.700 --> 03:38:33.700]  Hey, Ali. It's great to be talking to you.
[03:38:33.700 --> 03:38:35.700]  First time in for a war.
[03:38:35.700 --> 03:38:37.700]  I saw that you were on this platform.
[03:38:37.700 --> 03:38:39.700]  I had to get in touch, get on the show.
[03:38:39.700 --> 03:38:41.700]  I'm so excited you're on in for a war.
[03:38:41.700 --> 03:38:44.700]  And I just had a brief question.
[03:38:44.700 --> 03:38:48.700]  You mentioned earlier you alluded to common folk,
[03:38:48.700 --> 03:38:52.700]  not just taking it as social media to complain about journalists.
[03:38:52.700 --> 03:38:54.700]  And now we're hearing CJ Pearson from you.
[03:38:54.700 --> 03:38:59.700]  As then banned from Twitter, what practical steps do we have,
[03:38:59.700 --> 03:39:01.700]  aside from belly aching on Twitter?
[03:39:01.700 --> 03:39:03.700]  I mean, what do we actually do?
[03:39:03.700 --> 03:39:09.700]  What sort of game plan would you give to a group of people as to handle this situation?
[03:39:09.700 --> 03:39:13.700]  Something that we can do to really counteract people being de-platformed
[03:39:13.700 --> 03:39:16.700]  and journalists spreading fake news?
[03:39:16.700 --> 03:39:19.700]  You know, that's a great question, and it could be an hour-long segment.
[03:39:19.700 --> 03:39:21.700]  But I'll tell you this.
[03:39:21.700 --> 03:39:27.700]  I'm a big believer that God embedded rules inside of our DNA.
[03:39:27.700 --> 03:39:33.700]  The reason why the universe and our chemistry and biology are observable
[03:39:33.700 --> 03:39:35.700]  is because they're predictable.
[03:39:35.700 --> 03:39:40.700]  And one of the things that we do know that works, and the media employees'
[03:39:40.700 --> 03:39:43.700]  disgusting version of this, is shame.
[03:39:43.700 --> 03:39:45.700]  So we need to keep shaming reporters.
[03:39:45.700 --> 03:39:50.700]  We can never stop shaming them, because one day they might correct.
[03:39:50.700 --> 03:39:52.700]  One day they might repent.
[03:39:52.700 --> 03:39:54.700]  And so we have to use shame.
[03:39:54.700 --> 03:39:57.700]  I don't think that people should be targeted for harassment or bullied or doxxed
[03:39:57.700 --> 03:39:59.700]  or any of that other stuff.
[03:39:59.700 --> 03:40:02.700]  But if we screencap them instead of linking them,
[03:40:02.700 --> 03:40:06.700]  if we point to their nefarious deeds and their falsified information,
[03:40:06.700 --> 03:40:08.700]  then that is going to wake people up.
[03:40:08.700 --> 03:40:11.700]  You and I, Steve, have seen people become,
[03:40:11.700 --> 03:40:15.700]  we've seen Democrats come over to Trump's party in droves,
[03:40:15.700 --> 03:40:17.700]  simply because people don't want to be lied to.
[03:40:17.700 --> 03:40:22.700]  So I think that those are first, great steps, correct, rebuke.
[03:40:22.700 --> 03:40:25.700]  It's biblical, so it kind of doubles up as that one.
[03:40:25.700 --> 03:40:29.700]  But we'll talk about that again.
[03:40:29.700 --> 03:40:34.700]  I want to tie in one more caller who wants to talk about,
[03:40:34.700 --> 03:40:36.700]  I think, the tail end of this subject.
[03:40:36.700 --> 03:40:37.700]  I think it's Chase.
[03:40:37.700 --> 03:40:39.700]  Let's talk to Chase out of California,
[03:40:39.700 --> 03:40:43.700]  because I think that this will allow me to finish and expand upon Steve's question.
[03:40:43.700 --> 03:40:45.700]  Chase, how are you?
[03:40:45.700 --> 03:40:47.700]  I'm doing great.
[03:40:47.700 --> 03:40:48.700]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:40:48.700 --> 03:40:52.700]  This is Chase the Patriot in the front lines of California here.
[03:40:52.700 --> 03:40:54.700]  And I got some points for you.
[03:40:54.700 --> 03:40:58.700]  The first thing about the media, it's this reporter challenge I'm fired up for.
[03:40:58.700 --> 03:41:02.700]  I got my YouTube page fired up and I got some articles posted, Chase the Patriot.
[03:41:02.700 --> 03:41:05.700]  And if enough of us can get out there and do our own thing,
[03:41:05.700 --> 03:41:06.700]  What's the challenge?
[03:41:06.700 --> 03:41:07.700]  There's a narrative out there.
[03:41:07.700 --> 03:41:08.700]  What's that?
[03:41:08.700 --> 03:41:09.700]  What's the challenge, Chase?
[03:41:09.700 --> 03:41:11.700]  There's a reporter challenge for Info Wars right now going on.
[03:41:11.700 --> 03:41:12.700]  Okay.
[03:41:12.700 --> 03:41:14.700]  And I have my own.
[03:41:14.700 --> 03:41:15.700]  I just started.
[03:41:15.700 --> 03:41:16.700]  I'm fired up.
[03:41:16.700 --> 03:41:17.700]  I'm pretty excited about it.
[03:41:17.700 --> 03:41:21.700]  And one of the things that I've been talking about is these new California gun laws
[03:41:21.700 --> 03:41:24.700]  that are set to take effect on July 1st.
[03:41:24.700 --> 03:41:27.700]  There's nine million gun owners in California.
[03:41:27.700 --> 03:41:30.700]  And if they are held accountable to these new laws,
[03:41:30.700 --> 03:41:33.700]  these laws tend to spread across the rest of the country.
[03:41:33.700 --> 03:41:35.700]  And that's something we have to prevent.
[03:41:35.700 --> 03:41:39.700]  And if we can all get out there, take over the media.
[03:41:39.700 --> 03:41:43.700]  Before that's a story, if we can put the narrative out there first
[03:41:43.700 --> 03:41:47.700]  by putting our own report overriding their system,
[03:41:47.700 --> 03:41:52.700]  then we can put our own narrative and counteract what they're trying to do.
[03:41:52.700 --> 03:41:54.700]  Well, thank you, Chase, for your activism.
[03:41:54.700 --> 03:41:56.700]  I'm sure a lot of people are going to check out your reporter challenge.
[03:41:56.700 --> 03:41:59.700]  I want to encourage everyone to participate in this.
[03:41:59.700 --> 03:42:02.700]  With this last nearly minute we have before the break,
[03:42:02.700 --> 03:42:04.700]  we're going to take calls after the break.
[03:42:04.700 --> 03:42:05.700]  But I want to point this out.
[03:42:05.700 --> 03:42:07.700]  Andrew Breitbart was a friend of mine.
[03:42:07.700 --> 03:42:09.700]  And I love what he used to do at rallies.
[03:42:09.700 --> 03:42:12.700]  He used to say, hold up your phones.
[03:42:12.700 --> 03:42:14.700]  People would hold up their phones.
[03:42:14.700 --> 03:42:17.700]  And he would say, okay, you're now a reporter.
[03:42:17.700 --> 03:42:19.700]  And I want to be your editor.
[03:42:19.700 --> 03:42:21.700]  And that was such a powerful move.
[03:42:21.700 --> 03:42:22.700]  We are the press.
[03:42:22.700 --> 03:42:26.700]  The First Amendment does not create a class or an industry.
[03:42:26.700 --> 03:42:30.700]  It protects a duty and an obligation entitled to any citizen.
[03:42:30.700 --> 03:42:33.700]  You are guaranteed the same constitutional rights.
[03:42:33.700 --> 03:42:36.700]  You don't have to give up your sources just like these reporters
[03:42:36.700 --> 03:42:40.700]  who are paid the big bucks by Big Pharma and the other nefarious people.
[03:42:40.700 --> 03:42:42.700]  We're going to be back after the break.
[03:42:42.700 --> 03:42:44.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:42:44.700 --> 03:42:46.700]  I am Ali Alexander.
[03:42:46.700 --> 03:42:52.700]  We're so excited to be debunking the media and preventing a civil war.
[03:43:16.700 --> 03:43:20.700]  The U.S. military's military official, Mohammad Javed Larjani,
[03:43:20.700 --> 03:43:23.700]  said that Iranian intelligence officials did not stamp the passports
[03:43:23.700 --> 03:43:26.700]  of the al-Qaeda militants in order to conceal their movements
[03:43:26.700 --> 03:43:28.700]  and prevent detection by foreign governments.
[03:43:28.700 --> 03:43:31.700]  Al-Qaeda operatives were also given safe refuge in Iran.
[03:43:31.700 --> 03:43:35.700]  The U.S. government has long accused Iran of playing a role in the attacks.
[03:43:35.700 --> 03:43:39.700]  And the U.S. 9-11 Commission concluded that Iran played a role
[03:43:39.700 --> 03:43:41.700]  in facilitating the al-Qaeda terrorists.
[03:43:41.700 --> 03:43:44.700]  But these remarks represent the very first time
[03:43:44.700 --> 03:43:47.700]  Iran has publicly admitted to aiding al-Qaeda
[03:43:47.700 --> 03:43:50.700]  and playing a direct role in facilitating the 9-11 attacks.
[03:43:50.700 --> 03:44:15.700]  We're going to be back after the break.
[03:44:15.700 --> 03:44:41.700]  Thank you very much.
[03:44:41.700 --> 03:44:51.700]  Thank you very much.
[03:45:11.700 --> 03:45:21.700]  Thank you very much.
[03:45:41.700 --> 03:45:51.700]  Thank you very much.
[03:46:11.700 --> 03:46:21.700]  Thank you very much.
[03:46:41.700 --> 03:47:01.700]  Thank you very much.
[03:47:12.700 --> 03:47:20.700]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:47:20.700 --> 03:47:25.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:25.700 --> 03:47:29.700]  You know, if we're going to avoid 1776,
[03:47:29.700 --> 03:47:33.700]  it's going to take all of us speaking with one another.
[03:47:33.700 --> 03:47:35.700]  Civil debate, civil discussion.
[03:47:35.700 --> 03:47:38.700]  Instead of this cold civil war that the media is pushing,
[03:47:38.700 --> 03:47:41.700]  you know what I'm doing? Beep, beep, beep on my phone right now.
[03:47:41.700 --> 03:47:42.700]  I'm sharing.
[03:47:42.700 --> 03:47:44.700]  So if you're on Facebook, if you're on Periscope,
[03:47:44.700 --> 03:47:46.700]  I want you guys to click Share right now.
[03:47:46.700 --> 03:47:49.700]  It's so important that the last 15 minutes of this show,
[03:47:49.700 --> 03:47:51.700]  we touch the entire world.
[03:47:51.700 --> 03:47:53.700]  We touch the entire world and we let them know we love them.
[03:47:53.700 --> 03:47:54.700]  We want a debate.
[03:47:54.700 --> 03:47:56.700]  We want a conversation.
[03:47:56.700 --> 03:47:57.700]  We want to love our neighbor.
[03:47:57.700 --> 03:47:59.700]  And we'll make it.
[03:47:59.700 --> 03:48:02.700]  But I want to take a call from Johnny in California.
[03:48:02.700 --> 03:48:04.700]  He's got a great topic that they screened.
[03:48:04.700 --> 03:48:06.700]  So I want to talk to Johnny in California,
[03:48:06.700 --> 03:48:10.700]  and then we'll try finding Trevor after that.
[03:48:10.700 --> 03:48:12.700]  How are you, Johnny?
[03:48:12.700 --> 03:48:14.700]  Good. How are you?
[03:48:14.700 --> 03:48:15.700]  I'm doing well.
[03:48:15.700 --> 03:48:19.700]  Tell the listeners your question or topic.
[03:48:19.700 --> 03:48:23.700]  My question is, is there any movement going on behind the scenes
[03:48:23.700 --> 03:48:27.700]  to create like a new network, you know,
[03:48:27.700 --> 03:48:30.700]  in the news that kind of challenges, you know,
[03:48:30.700 --> 03:48:34.700]  the conventional media like MSNBC and even Fox.
[03:48:34.700 --> 03:48:37.700]  Because I think that might be a great help for our movement.
[03:48:37.700 --> 03:48:40.700]  Do you know of any investors, you know,
[03:48:40.700 --> 03:48:44.700]  like to try to call talent together and get something moving?
[03:48:44.700 --> 03:48:48.700]  Because I think that, you know, just having info wars is not enough.
[03:48:48.700 --> 03:48:50.700]  I mean, there are other outlets,
[03:48:50.700 --> 03:48:54.700]  but I think having something on television table every night
[03:48:54.700 --> 03:48:57.700]  that conservative screen watch would be great.
[03:48:57.700 --> 03:48:59.700]  Yeah. Thanks for calling, Johnny.
[03:48:59.700 --> 03:49:02.700]  I'll answer your, I'll let them let you go and I'll answer your question.
[03:49:02.700 --> 03:49:05.700]  Again, Andrew Breitbart said more voices, not less.
[03:49:05.700 --> 03:49:08.700]  And that's the great thing about what they're doing on info wars is they've had on
[03:49:08.700 --> 03:49:12.700]  Candacellens, myself, CJ Pearson, Mike Cernovich,
[03:49:12.700 --> 03:49:16.700]  they've had on people who, you know, aren't on the payroll here
[03:49:16.700 --> 03:49:19.700]  because we have important topics that need to get out.
[03:49:19.700 --> 03:49:22.700]  What I will tell you, what you can be encouraged by
[03:49:22.700 --> 03:49:25.700]  is I know of at least two billionaires that are working on,
[03:49:25.700 --> 03:49:28.700]  you know, this is something you got to do in media.
[03:49:28.700 --> 03:49:30.700]  You got to be polite. You don't mention the competition.
[03:49:30.700 --> 03:49:32.700]  So it's all a friendly competition,
[03:49:32.700 --> 03:49:35.700]  but there are voices on the right.
[03:49:35.700 --> 03:49:39.700]  There are other channels that you can supplement with.
[03:49:39.700 --> 03:49:42.700]  So, you know, use Periscope, follow a lot of people,
[03:49:42.700 --> 03:49:46.700]  and you'll see these other platforms that are created or expand,
[03:49:46.700 --> 03:49:49.700]  and, you know, info wars is expanding all the time.
[03:49:49.700 --> 03:49:53.700]  And so it's very exciting what's happening inside of new media,
[03:49:53.700 --> 03:49:55.700]  but this is what I do want to encourage people.
[03:49:55.700 --> 03:49:58.700]  I don't like Fox News. I don't watch Fox News.
[03:49:58.700 --> 03:50:01.700]  But what I do want to say is you can't leave Twitter.
[03:50:01.700 --> 03:50:04.700]  That's where the debate is happening. That's where the narrative is determined.
[03:50:04.700 --> 03:50:09.700]  You can't leave Facebook yet. We're close, but we can't leave Facebook yet.
[03:50:09.700 --> 03:50:12.700]  You know, unfortunately, you can use ad blockers.
[03:50:12.700 --> 03:50:15.700]  You can use all kinds of things to mitigate the money that they make after you,
[03:50:15.700 --> 03:50:18.700]  but we have to be in the arena. We have to fight.
[03:50:18.700 --> 03:50:23.700]  We cannot afford to seed platforms where the narrative is being constructed.
[03:50:23.700 --> 03:50:27.700]  Now, we don't have to shop at Starbucks. We don't have to shop at Target,
[03:50:27.700 --> 03:50:30.700]  but there are certain places you have to make a very mature
[03:50:30.700 --> 03:50:33.700]  and intellectual reason decision of, okay, I hate this platform,
[03:50:33.700 --> 03:50:35.700]  but I'm going to stay in the fight here.
[03:50:35.700 --> 03:50:38.700]  So I always tell people, yes, we need alternatives,
[03:50:38.700 --> 03:50:42.700]  but if we all flee, then all we've done is created a ghetto,
[03:50:42.700 --> 03:50:46.700]  and it's easier to off us. Let's talk to Trevor at Michigan.
[03:50:46.700 --> 03:50:50.700]  Trevor is actually a friend of mine, so I'm glad that Trevor called in.
[03:50:50.700 --> 03:50:53.700]  Trevor, what's up? What's up? What's up, my buddy?
[03:50:53.700 --> 03:50:58.700]  Holly, good to talk to you. I just wanted to bring up this subject that...
[03:50:58.700 --> 03:51:02.700]  Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, let's tell people this.
[03:51:02.700 --> 03:51:07.700]  You have been championing Info Wars longer than I've ever watched it,
[03:51:07.700 --> 03:51:11.700]  and you called me the other day. You said, this is just funny.
[03:51:11.700 --> 03:51:15.700]  This is just surreal, isn't it? Isn't that true?
[03:51:15.700 --> 03:51:18.700]  Yeah, it's what a time to be alive.
[03:51:18.700 --> 03:51:20.700]  All right, so what's your question again?
[03:51:20.700 --> 03:51:24.700]  My question is why the mainstream media,
[03:51:24.700 --> 03:51:28.700]  virtue signals and claims to be in the right,
[03:51:28.700 --> 03:51:31.700]  why do they protect and defend an ideology
[03:51:31.700 --> 03:51:35.700]  that is the anti-opposite of what they advocate for?
[03:51:35.700 --> 03:51:37.700]  And I'm talking about Islam,
[03:51:37.700 --> 03:51:42.700]  and I would like to know what your opinion is on why the media chooses to defend that.
[03:51:42.700 --> 03:51:46.700]  I'll be quite honest. It's a game of math, I think, Trevor.
[03:51:46.700 --> 03:51:53.700]  They don't actually like Islam. They don't like the alleged prophet Muhammad.
[03:51:53.700 --> 03:51:57.700]  What they're trying to do is they're trying to radicalize people.
[03:51:57.700 --> 03:52:02.700]  I hear this all the time, is the Hispanics, if we just appeal to them,
[03:52:02.700 --> 03:52:05.700]  they're very Catholic, they'll be GOP.
[03:52:05.700 --> 03:52:07.700]  Well, no, that's not what works for Texas,
[03:52:07.700 --> 03:52:11.700]  where we have focused on economic growth and entrepreneurship,
[03:52:11.700 --> 03:52:14.700]  seeing someone as a person instead of their color.
[03:52:14.700 --> 03:52:20.700]  And so what they try to do is they try to assign grievances to different groups,
[03:52:20.700 --> 03:52:23.700]  ethnic, religious, or gender, or whatever,
[03:52:23.700 --> 03:52:28.700]  that that person's grievance becomes higher than their economic interest
[03:52:28.700 --> 03:52:30.700]  or their spiritual interest.
[03:52:30.700 --> 03:52:33.700]  And I talked about this a lot in private trainings.
[03:52:33.700 --> 03:52:35.700]  In fact, I want them to bring this up.
[03:52:35.700 --> 03:52:38.700]  AmericanPriority.com, I have a training on this very topic.
[03:52:38.700 --> 03:52:40.700]  So I want you guys to all come there.
[03:52:40.700 --> 03:52:43.700]  We're going to have info wars there. They're going to be on media row.
[03:52:43.700 --> 03:52:45.700]  AmericanPriority.com.
[03:52:45.700 --> 03:52:46.700]  You guys can sign up.
[03:52:46.700 --> 03:52:48.700]  If you go down to the bottom of that page,
[03:52:48.700 --> 03:52:51.700]  you can click the attend button and you can buy your tickets while they're still cheap.
[03:52:51.700 --> 03:52:54.700]  But we're going to have trainings on all of this.
[03:52:54.700 --> 03:52:55.700]  We're going to talk about this stuff.
[03:52:55.700 --> 03:52:56.700]  We're going to equip you.
[03:52:56.700 --> 03:52:58.700]  But that's what's happening is it's a math game.
[03:52:58.700 --> 03:53:00.700]  It's a math game going on.
[03:53:00.700 --> 03:53:04.700]  They don't actually like monotheistic religions.
[03:53:04.700 --> 03:53:08.700]  They just know that there's a minority of Muslims that they can empower
[03:53:08.700 --> 03:53:11.700]  to have grievances and hate Republicans.
[03:53:11.700 --> 03:53:13.700]  They don't care about women.
[03:53:13.700 --> 03:53:15.700]  They don't care about gay people.
[03:53:15.700 --> 03:53:17.700]  They don't care about Muslims.
[03:53:17.700 --> 03:53:19.700]  They sure as heck don't care about black people.
[03:53:19.700 --> 03:53:23.700]  And we've seen that time and time again when a black voice stands up.
[03:53:23.700 --> 03:53:25.700]  They got to shut them down.
[03:53:25.700 --> 03:53:27.700]  They do the same.
[03:53:27.700 --> 03:53:29.700]  They do the same with Islam.
[03:53:29.700 --> 03:53:31.700]  They do the same with Mormons.
[03:53:31.700 --> 03:53:33.700]  They do the same with all kinds of other people.
[03:53:33.700 --> 03:53:39.700]  Let's talk to Frank in Virginia if we can.
[03:53:39.700 --> 03:53:41.700]  Mr. Alexander, can you hear me?
[03:53:41.700 --> 03:53:44.700]  I can hear you loud and clear.
[03:53:44.700 --> 03:53:45.700]  It's nice to talk to you.
[03:53:45.700 --> 03:53:49.700]  I think we have to recognize that free speech, natural speech,
[03:53:49.700 --> 03:53:53.700]  and electronic or broadcast speech are not the same thing.
[03:53:53.700 --> 03:53:57.700]  Broadcast speech or amplified speech requires a certain amount of responsibility
[03:53:57.700 --> 03:54:00.700]  to be exercised to get the facts straight.
[03:54:00.700 --> 03:54:03.700]  And you should be able to challenge people when they get the facts wrong
[03:54:03.700 --> 03:54:08.700]  if they're broadcasting a false narrative.
[03:54:08.700 --> 03:54:15.700]  It sounds like you're talking a little bit about regulation.
[03:54:15.700 --> 03:54:19.700]  The regulation rules on broadcasts versus cable or internet.
[03:54:19.700 --> 03:54:22.700]  The cable and internet have become broadcasts.
[03:54:22.700 --> 03:54:24.700]  They're the same thing now, essentially.
[03:54:24.700 --> 03:54:27.700]  Wi-Fi is certainly broadcast everywhere.
[03:54:27.700 --> 03:54:33.700]  A lot of free market conservatives like myself,
[03:54:33.700 --> 03:54:37.700]  we find ourselves, I think Alex has even talked about the struggle with this,
[03:54:37.700 --> 03:54:39.700]  do we regulate or don't we regulate?
[03:54:39.700 --> 03:54:41.700]  The argument for regulating is that, well,
[03:54:41.700 --> 03:54:45.700]  it's impacting the same number of people that broadcast.
[03:54:45.700 --> 03:54:49.700]  But the argument against regulating is that the United States government
[03:54:49.700 --> 03:54:52.700]  and the people and the taxpayers built broadcast.
[03:54:52.700 --> 03:54:58.700]  And so we literally own that stream that ABC, NBC, CBS is tapping into,
[03:54:58.700 --> 03:55:05.700]  whereas the other stuff has been a private public partnership.
[03:55:05.700 --> 03:55:10.700]  So I'll tell you, this issue is very near and dear to my heart,
[03:55:10.700 --> 03:55:15.700]  and I'm trying to tiptoe into the water of regulation,
[03:55:15.700 --> 03:55:20.700]  but I do agree with you, Frank, that there needs to be something more than we have.
[03:55:20.700 --> 03:55:22.700]  There needs to be something more than we have.
[03:55:22.700 --> 03:55:27.700]  And in some states like New York, it's illegal to fire someone for political reasons.
[03:55:27.700 --> 03:55:31.700]  So even a liberal state like New York has a law on the books
[03:55:31.700 --> 03:55:33.700]  that I think should be a law everywhere,
[03:55:33.700 --> 03:55:36.700]  but that's not a law that you can find anywhere in the South.
[03:55:36.700 --> 03:55:39.700]  So it's really interesting. We do need to do a gut check.
[03:55:39.700 --> 03:55:42.700]  And I want to encourage people, I'm glad Frank brought this up.
[03:55:42.700 --> 03:55:48.700]  You know, I'm glad Frank brought this up because we need to respect the founders
[03:55:48.700 --> 03:55:52.700]  and we need to learn from their principles, but we can't be afraid to be new founders.
[03:55:52.700 --> 03:55:57.700]  We can't be afraid to find the new frontier and establish new rules
[03:55:57.700 --> 03:56:00.700]  based off those old principles.
[03:56:00.700 --> 03:56:05.700]  That's why I'm here on InfoWars. That's why I'm plugging AmericanPriority.com,
[03:56:05.700 --> 03:56:09.700]  a conference that's happening in Washington, D.C., September 6th through 8th,
[03:56:09.700 --> 03:56:11.700]  and I'm bringing the whole movement together.
[03:56:11.700 --> 03:56:14.700]  If you go to that About page, I say, okay, you know,
[03:56:14.700 --> 03:56:18.700]  we're going to have about a thousand people and government, libertarians, conservatorians,
[03:56:18.700 --> 03:56:21.700]  MAGA populists, we're going to have a bunch of people there
[03:56:21.700 --> 03:56:24.700]  because it's time that the movement come together.
[03:56:24.700 --> 03:56:29.700]  We'd be about free thinkers, free association, free speech, free thought,
[03:56:29.700 --> 03:56:32.700]  and we debate this stuff out because we are the people who are living.
[03:56:32.700 --> 03:56:38.700]  Thomas Jefferson talked about this, you know, that we need to govern ourselves as a republic.
[03:56:38.700 --> 03:56:41.700]  We don't need to be accountable to the dead. They're dead.
[03:56:41.700 --> 03:56:45.700]  They're good guiding lights and rules, and I'm certainly an originalist,
[03:56:45.700 --> 03:56:49.700]  but, you know, we can't be dependent on them and we can't just stay in that box.
[03:56:49.700 --> 03:56:51.700]  So, you know, Frank brings up a very complicated issue,
[03:56:51.700 --> 03:56:56.700]  but it's one that we're all vastly becoming aware of and having to plug.
