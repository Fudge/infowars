[00:00.000 --> 00:16.600]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:16.600 --> 00:24.480]  so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones well everything
[00:24.480 --> 00:28.080]  has come clearly into view we have a crystal-clear image of exactly what
[00:28.080 --> 00:32.120]  the globalists are up to and yes it's overwhelming at many levels and quite
[00:32.120 --> 00:38.760]  frightening but we have a chance to stop it if we take action now and we've
[00:38.760 --> 00:42.240]  not been caught flat-footed by the world government if you're a radio
[00:42.240 --> 00:45.600]  listener well you're not having to look at me right now but I am wearing the
[00:45.600 --> 00:52.480]  Bill Gates uniform that now Mark Zuckerberg wears it is a pink cashmere
[00:52.480 --> 01:00.400]  sweater with a white collared shirt to look like mr. Rogers or to look
[01:00.400 --> 01:04.880]  non-threatening I've said it many times that if Hitler wore a pink uniform he
[01:04.880 --> 01:09.280]  would have won the war because he would have looked non-threatening this is all
[01:09.280 --> 01:14.120]  done by image consultants and now you can notice that again Bill Gates is a
[01:14.120 --> 01:18.000]  front for the globalist so is Mark Zuckerberg now the two even appear on
[01:18.000 --> 01:23.920]  stage together wearing the pink uniform and I think a week and a half ago when
[01:23.920 --> 01:27.880]  they had that record online stream at London real with David I over a million
[01:27.880 --> 01:36.320]  300,000 viewers outside of the YouTube Twitter Facebook combine David I wore
[01:36.320 --> 01:40.840]  the Bill Gates uniform I think to throw it back in their face maybe it was just a
[01:40.840 --> 01:46.840]  coincidence but he is joining us in the third hour today maybe a little bit in
[01:46.840 --> 01:50.440]  the fourth hour than Gerald Salante takes over Paul Joseph Watson joins us with
[01:50.440 --> 01:59.600]  big developments from the UK coming up at the bottom of the hour okay that said
[01:59.600 --> 02:04.480]  you notice these stacks of articles and documents and things here in front of
[02:04.480 --> 02:10.040]  me maybe with an overhead panning shot this is not a prop I have read over and
[02:10.040 --> 02:15.760]  looked at all of these this is enough to do 20 hours straight not ever going back
[02:15.760 --> 02:19.760]  over one piece of information again but I'm gonna do my best to condense all of
[02:19.760 --> 02:25.480]  this down today but the quickening is certainly here in many many ways out of
[02:25.480 --> 02:33.520]  everything we have to cover the most important is the big picture COVID-19 is
[02:33.520 --> 02:37.760]  a hysteria it is designed to usher in total surveillance total control
[02:37.760 --> 02:42.640]  medical tyranny forced inoculation and the tracking systems to make sure you've
[02:42.640 --> 02:46.240]  submitted to inoculation that is going to be used as the basis of a global
[02:46.240 --> 02:50.680]  social credit score and the casualist society with all the nightmare
[02:50.680 --> 02:56.480]  authoritarian ramifications because of course many say well what do I have to
[02:56.480 --> 03:04.360]  hide many people will say I'm going to go along with the system but when you go
[03:04.360 --> 03:08.600]  along with the system and its predatory that doesn't get you ahead if you were a
[03:08.600 --> 03:12.080]  sheep and there was a slaughter going on you were conscious and knew that there
[03:12.080 --> 03:18.280]  was a slaughter complying with going into the slaughterhouse he is not brave it's
[03:18.280 --> 03:25.480]  not altruistic it's not stunning it's not cool it's it's it's stupid and so
[03:25.480 --> 03:30.680]  that's exactly what's going on here now the big takeaway while everybody's
[03:30.680 --> 03:34.520]  obsessed with general Flynn being exonerated and obsessed with oh a couple
[03:34.520 --> 03:39.120]  people might have coronavirus in the White House oh it's so scary oh the
[03:39.120 --> 03:45.200]  coronavirus is making a comeback funny it never reached one tenth of what they
[03:45.200 --> 03:49.840]  said it would 120th but now they add all death statistics into the column they
[03:49.840 --> 03:55.520]  can go look it came back a hundred dead or a thousand dead it came back almost
[03:55.520 --> 04:01.640]  everyone's had two three surgeries heart failure cancer over 80 years old but
[04:01.640 --> 04:06.840]  none of those facts none of those realities matter because it's so fun to
[04:06.840 --> 04:12.760]  get into the hysteria while the real fact is the third world is completely in
[04:12.760 --> 04:18.440]  cardiac arrest financially going into total starvation and we are going into
[04:18.440 --> 04:24.120]  collapse here as well and so just like I told you 13 weeks ago back in mid
[04:24.120 --> 04:28.280]  January that this COVID thing was the big globalist move to lockdown society
[04:28.280 --> 04:34.240]  and get ready and it took five six weeks to see that happen I'm telling you a lot
[04:34.240 --> 04:38.520]  of folks are like hey a lot of folks are waking up the COVID hysteria hey this
[04:38.520 --> 04:43.000]  thing might dissipate oh no they have already triggered the global depression
[04:43.000 --> 04:46.520]  and unless they get the blame for it the globalist they're gonna continue to
[04:46.520 --> 04:50.400]  press the global depression while posing as saviors giving us all the
[04:50.400 --> 04:54.560]  reasons we need to take force inoculations and national ID cards to be
[04:54.560 --> 05:00.000]  able to go outside again it's called being held hostage the panic that has
[05:00.000 --> 05:04.400]  been orchestrated by the global corporates media and the chai comms is
[05:04.400 --> 05:09.480]  going to now trigger a worldwide depression fact we're already into the
[05:09.480 --> 05:13.080]  worldwide depression in the death sentence for the third world but it's
[05:13.080 --> 05:18.160]  critical to understand that the longer the shutdown persists the worse it's
[05:18.160 --> 05:23.400]  going to be a month of shutdown will destroy decades of wealth that's been
[05:23.400 --> 05:26.920]  built up in a complex economy that's what we've always said it's important to be a
[05:26.920 --> 05:30.400]  prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient because the globalists
[05:30.400 --> 05:34.840]  want to make us all dependent so that we're under their control they've
[05:34.840 --> 05:40.120]  admitted all of this so remember how does info wars continue years and
[05:40.120 --> 05:43.720]  decades in many cases to be able to predict things before they happen
[05:43.720 --> 05:48.680]  because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan and yes
[05:48.680 --> 05:52.760]  it's dystopic and yes it's scary but denying it and letting them carry it out
[05:52.760 --> 05:57.440]  is a thousand times more scary it's time to stop the denial and realize what's
[05:57.440 --> 06:00.160]  really happening
[06:03.960 --> 06:11.480]  from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[06:12.680 --> 06:17.200]  oh my gosh we're told that Tim Downing Street had to quarantine people in the
[06:17.200 --> 06:23.160]  last few months and have locked down and we're also told that up to eight secret
[06:23.160 --> 06:28.000]  service agents have tested positive for COVID in the president is refusing to
[06:28.000 --> 06:34.240]  quarantine and so is the vice president what incredible trade it's meanwhile
[06:34.240 --> 06:39.480]  flights still bringing 15,000 people a day into the UK without virus testing
[06:39.480 --> 06:44.080]  including travelers from China Italy and the US but you've got to stay in your
[06:44.080 --> 06:51.400]  home and they've got a national poll out showing that nine out of ten in the UK
[06:51.400 --> 06:59.600]  want to lock down to carry on because they are such incredible heroes saving
[06:59.600 --> 07:08.280]  lives stay home wear a mask don't go outside and save lives it's like you're
[07:08.280 --> 07:15.960]  in World War two said Tom Hanks in a video yesterday you all the heroes
[07:15.960 --> 07:24.160]  incredibly devastating and as I've always said if Hitler or a pink uniform
[07:24.160 --> 07:27.440]  he would have won World War two because people would have bowed down and said
[07:27.440 --> 07:33.720]  somebody wearing pink is nothing but good that's why Bellarmel and the gates
[07:33.720 --> 07:37.640]  always wear pink in public it's why Mark Zuckerberg's gotten rid of his
[07:37.640 --> 07:43.480]  characteristic gray or black t-shirt and he now wears pink sweaters under his
[07:43.480 --> 07:49.640]  mentor Bill Gates and see I'm wearing a pink sweater of your TV viewer I'm
[07:49.640 --> 07:54.920]  wearing the Bill Gates uniform so it doesn't matter I get up on TV and say I
[07:54.920 --> 07:59.680]  want to reduce the world population doesn't matter if I say I want death
[07:59.680 --> 08:04.440]  panels doesn't matter if I say I want more childhood death doesn't matter if I
[08:04.440 --> 08:09.400]  run Planned Parenthood doesn't matter if I've been caught sterilizing people all
[08:09.400 --> 08:16.440]  the world he's wearing a pink shirt and after all we know anyone wearing a pink
[08:16.440 --> 08:21.040]  shirts gotta be good Warren Buffett more and more wears pink shirts and almost
[08:21.040 --> 08:28.400]  always poses with an ice cream cone look ice cream cone it's like oh ice cream
[08:28.400 --> 08:33.560]  he's like a little boy he's like a little child he doesn't launder hundreds of
[08:33.560 --> 08:42.000]  billions in drug money not caught doing it in 2010 no Warren Buffett wears pink
[08:42.000 --> 08:49.120]  and he has an ice cream cone David Ike is gonna be joining us in the third hour
[08:49.120 --> 08:53.680]  he got massively censored banned off the internet for questioning COVID-19 and
[08:53.680 --> 08:57.240]  pointing out they're putting deaths from a bunch of other diseases in the same
[08:57.240 --> 09:02.280]  column in Europe the US and Canada in Australia it's all globally run by the
[09:02.280 --> 09:11.480]  standards of the WHO and when San Antonio passed a law last Thursday saying
[09:11.480 --> 09:17.600]  you'll be arrested if you say Chinese virus they said because the WHO says it
[09:17.600 --> 09:23.400]  doesn't come from China and I guess the WHO could say the moon is made of cheese
[09:23.400 --> 09:28.440]  so David Ike had his little nod to Bill Gates with his little pink shirt well
[09:28.440 --> 09:35.040]  now I am wearing the pink shirt just to all show that he can be trusted look I'm
[09:35.040 --> 09:42.920]  wearing pink let's get serious if you go back to the middle of January and we
[09:42.920 --> 09:46.040]  saw the buildings being locked down people being well into their homes the
[09:46.040 --> 09:50.320]  drones women being shot at checkpoints and I came on there and I said folks the
[09:50.320 --> 09:54.960]  UN's running this they're gonna hype this here domestically when Trump doesn't
[09:54.960 --> 09:58.800]  respond and tries to say it's a hoax they're gonna blame him and say every
[09:58.800 --> 10:04.160]  death is his fault so Trump has to at least come out and take control of it
[10:04.160 --> 10:08.960]  or the NIH will be in complete control the states and counties and blue cities
[10:08.960 --> 10:13.680]  will be in control they'll create the precedent for total complete lockdown
[10:13.680 --> 10:18.120]  outside of the federal government's control so Trump's got to jump in take
[10:18.120 --> 10:22.400]  control of it to ride the tiger and then in a proper time come out and expose
[10:22.400 --> 10:28.680]  the fake numbers and try to turn the economy back on because the public
[10:28.680 --> 10:33.240]  wanted to buy into the hoax they saw the science fiction dystopic images out of
[10:33.240 --> 10:38.480]  China all choreographed and now we know exactly what happened we'll be breaking
[10:38.480 --> 10:45.160]  it all down today but what's the real agenda behind COVID-19 global cashless
[10:45.160 --> 10:48.840]  society surveilling everything you do tied to the fact that you have been
[10:48.840 --> 10:54.200]  inoculated with a digital ink tattoo the bill among the gates have patented
[10:54.200 --> 10:58.520]  under the skin now they've officially put out those patents but the media will
[10:58.520 --> 11:03.560]  look at another patent they have for a bracelet a watch or a chip to track you
[11:03.560 --> 11:10.440]  in live time using wireless patent 2020 060606 and they'll go oh that's not a
[11:10.440 --> 11:15.880]  chip necessarily it's fake news even though they have the other MIT push
[11:15.880 --> 11:21.960]  patent the bill among the gates saying it's under the skin well that all got
[11:21.960 --> 11:27.160]  put to bed yesterday Benjamin Netanyahu came out and said he has shin bet the
[11:27.160 --> 11:32.600]  internals Israeli security force looking at making every child in Israel take an
[11:32.600 --> 11:39.320]  implantable chip for COVID-19 of course to make sure you stay separated that by
[11:39.320 --> 11:44.640]  the way is the Jerusalem host Benjamin Netanyahu suggests microchipping kids
[11:44.640 --> 11:53.040]  slammed by experts hell you on must says put them in your brain so that's where
[11:53.040 --> 11:58.680]  we are any excuse for COVID-19 and now you're locked down you're a hero for not
[11:58.680 --> 12:04.160]  leaving your house in the UK but 15,000 people a day flying in totally untested
[12:04.160 --> 12:09.320]  it's all complete theater training you that you are obsolete and that you are
[12:09.320 --> 12:13.680]  non-essential for the robot takeover the end of the carbon-based light form the
[12:13.680 --> 12:17.600]  rise of the silicon life form as all the top globalists say they believe it's
[12:17.600 --> 12:22.960]  about to happen but the big news when we come back it's much worse than you're
[12:22.960 --> 12:30.320]  being told very powerful article on info wars dot com laying all of what's
[12:30.320 --> 12:35.360]  really going on out with the economy
[12:35.520 --> 12:42.800]  US risking a second wave and depression mark Zandy says that's right the wave
[12:42.800 --> 12:46.400]  was tiny compared to what they said it would be but now because they count all
[12:46.400 --> 12:51.480]  deaths as COVID-19 they're gonna hype it up again at the end of the summer and
[12:51.480 --> 12:55.040]  say the lockdown can never stop or all of you not locking down our murderers
[12:55.040 --> 12:59.520]  and then the hospitals will all have the testing kits now that test positive
[12:59.520 --> 13:04.000]  if ever had the flu or the coronavirus in the last decade coronavirus was
[13:04.000 --> 13:09.920]  common cold virus there is and so there'll be even more hysteria and more
[13:09.920 --> 13:14.720]  finger-pointing and more mask-wearing ensuring a long dark depression they
[13:14.720 --> 13:18.760]  believe will remove president trump bankrupt the western world and put us
[13:18.760 --> 13:23.000]  fully under servitude like the third world that's why Bill Gates gets so
[13:23.000 --> 13:26.480]  excited when he was on a ferrite Zarkaria they talk about total economic
[13:26.480 --> 13:31.440]  collapse because this means with all their stolen wealth when things collapse
[13:31.440 --> 13:36.680]  they can buy everything up for pennies on the dollar and then exercise total
[13:36.680 --> 13:43.280]  control over the population that's why now it's so essential for all of us to
[13:43.280 --> 13:47.120]  become self-sufficient and the first thing you can do is learn how to use a
[13:47.120 --> 13:52.160]  firearm to protect yourself in a defensive way and to learn some basic
[13:52.160 --> 13:57.280]  defense moves and to have water filtration air filtration and high
[13:57.280 --> 14:01.480]  quality storeable foods all available highest quality ready to ship to you at

[14:10.560 --> 14:14.440]  operation which is as you can see so important now that everybody else is
[14:14.440 --> 14:18.080]  getting censored and shut down unless they've been to need a Bill Gates and
[14:18.080 --> 14:23.280]  say he's Lord and Savior like Jack Pysovic's done unless you bow the New

[16:04.920 --> 16:10.800]  position it with economic tariffs taxes and controls to our family farms and
[16:10.800 --> 16:15.360]  industry that's based the United States has to shut down or be part of a large
[16:15.360 --> 16:21.600]  corporate conglomerate that's part of making us obsolete so that as the human
[16:21.600 --> 16:26.560]  world is phased out they can simply look at us and say because again you are
[16:26.560 --> 16:32.080]  non-essential that's what the robots and all of this is about it's about setting
[16:32.080 --> 16:36.000]  it up where we're no longer in charge of our lives we can be told to stay on our
[16:36.000 --> 16:41.000]  houses natural shut up this world doesn't belong to people anyways it belongs to
[16:41.000 --> 16:45.640]  the new AI gods the rich elitist that emerged with machines yeah that sounds
[16:45.640 --> 16:49.880]  completely insane doesn't it that's actually the public plan they're
[16:49.880 --> 16:54.600]  pushing these people are completely psychotic and make Hitler look like a
[16:54.600 --> 16:57.120]  choir boy

[18:00.000 --> 18:07.960]  White House officials buried CDC report but depending on the graph they're 50
[18:07.960 --> 18:14.080]  to 10 times lower COVID-19 death rates than they predicted in the very same
[18:14.080 --> 18:18.200]  groups now put out all these new fake numbers and Trump's like no I'm not
[18:18.200 --> 18:22.160]  putting these numbers out predicting giant deaths and millions more cases
[18:22.160 --> 18:28.560]  because he goes I don't trust your testing because he knows biologist in
[18:28.560 --> 18:33.840]  Australia and Africa and other areas have tested people and found that these
[18:33.840 --> 18:39.240]  tests are all wrong weather design that's why quote Fauci at the NIH remember
[18:39.240 --> 18:46.200]  three months ago approved unapproved test from China because they want
[18:46.200 --> 18:51.920]  everyone to be positive so they can test everyone dying look up the number that
[18:51.920 --> 18:56.480]  the average number of people that died daily on planet Earth the estimate
[18:56.480 --> 19:00.720]  versus the average number that died every day in the United States and they
[19:00.720 --> 19:06.160]  got the graphs again I keep harping on this they move the dead that died of
[19:06.160 --> 19:10.320]  heart attacks and car wrecks and cancer and pneumonia over into the COVID column
[19:10.320 --> 19:16.920]  and Burks admitted two months ago and again a month ago on the stand on the
[19:16.920 --> 19:24.160]  stage that they do that this is inclusive
[19:24.160 --> 19:36.440]  it's simply amazing so the average number of deaths by world region
[19:37.160 --> 19:47.640]  wow 50 million deaths every year and so I guess if they just this is more than 50
[19:47.640 --> 19:54.720]  million going up towards 60 million I guess if they just count everybody dying
[19:54.720 --> 20:01.600]  let's say 56 million people are gonna die this year from COVID that's fraction
[20:01.600 --> 20:06.240]  magic that's statistic magic but oh I wouldn't pull this article up from
[20:06.240 --> 20:13.160]  California Globe on April 14th experts significantly lower coronavirus death
[20:13.160 --> 20:18.280]  projections in California so then they lower them down to nothing and then now
[20:18.280 --> 20:21.960]  that it's oh going up a little higher than they thought once they lowered it
[20:21.960 --> 20:27.400]  down now they say it's exploding so first they say it's gonna be a hundred
[20:27.400 --> 20:30.280]  feet tall and they go oh actually it's gonna be a centimeter high they go oh
[20:30.280 --> 20:36.640]  actually it's two centimeters high they play those games with you and I every
[20:36.640 --> 20:44.560]  single day but there are reports coming out the Dr. Fauci's National Institute of
[20:44.560 --> 20:51.400]  Allergy and Infectious Disease NIAID funded the communist Chinese government
[20:51.400 --> 20:55.920]  and was the main funder of the Wuhan virus laboratory we reported that of
[20:55.920 --> 21:01.240]  course three months ago but now it's NAP it's in Reuters it's in Newsweek but
[21:01.240 --> 21:07.160]  does it matter when you turn into CNN or MSNBC they say it's fake news so the
[21:07.160 --> 21:11.320]  very people that stand to make all this money off of it the very people that
[21:11.320 --> 21:17.600]  stand to control our lives that admit they want to be populate us are the
[21:17.600 --> 21:21.360]  ones now want to put these things in our bodies people go oh no Bill Gates is a
[21:21.360 --> 21:26.000]  philanthropist yeah 20 something years ago he put his hundred plus billion
[21:26.000 --> 21:30.040]  dollars into a tax-free foundation with Warren and Buffett so his companies all
[21:30.040 --> 21:39.120]  run profits he keeps the profits and then only gives maybe 1% a year of the
[21:39.120 --> 21:44.880]  money into quote charity which is sterilizing people and controlling the
[21:44.880 --> 21:52.960]  population here's a few clips of Bill Gates talking about childhood death and
[21:52.960 --> 21:56.240]  depopulation and of course we have clips of him talking about death panels get
[21:56.240 --> 22:00.720]  rid of all people but here's some of the things he said recently chance for us to
[22:00.720 --> 22:07.640]  share things like producing childhood death and improving the nutrition so
[22:07.640 --> 22:13.000]  it's a chance of Africa meet with scientists we see a lot of things that
[22:13.000 --> 22:18.480]  are going very well things like producing childhood death and improving
[22:18.480 --> 22:24.120]  the nutrition so of Africa meet with scientists we see a lot of things that
[22:24.120 --> 22:28.560]  are going very well things like producing childhood death and improving the
[22:28.560 --> 22:33.320]  nutrition so it's a chance of Africa meet with scientists we see a lot of
[22:33.320 --> 22:38.600]  things that are going very well things like producing childhood death and things
[22:38.600 --> 22:43.120]  like producing childhood death and the economy is not going to be anything like
[22:43.120 --> 22:47.280]  it was this and to take a long time to recover it's going to be you know people
[22:47.280 --> 22:51.800]  are going to be surprised at how slow and how fitful this is let's watch that
[22:51.800 --> 22:59.720]  video one more time where Bill Gates becomes visibly joyful excited almost
[22:59.720 --> 23:04.200]  having an orgasm when Fareed Zarkaria the other fellow globalist the
[23:04.200 --> 23:08.640]  Bilderberg group on CNN talks about how horrible the economy is and how we
[23:08.640 --> 23:13.720]  better get used to it was this going to take a long time to recover it's going
[23:13.720 --> 23:18.920]  to be you know people are going to be surprised at how slow and how fitful
[23:18.920 --> 23:26.920]  this is in the video Gates gets more here we clearly need a vaccine that works
[23:26.920 --> 23:33.920]  in the upper age range because they're most at risk of that and doing that so
[23:33.920 --> 23:38.440]  that you amp it up so it works in older people and yet you don't have side
[23:38.440 --> 23:44.840]  effects you know if we have you know one in ten thousand side effects that's you
[23:44.840 --> 23:51.040]  know way more seven hundred thousand you know people who will suffer from that so
[23:51.040 --> 23:56.560]  really understanding the safety at gigantic scale across all age-ranked
[23:56.560 --> 24:03.160]  ranges you know pregnant male female undernourished existing comorbidities
[24:03.160 --> 24:07.720]  it's very very hard and that actual decision of okay let's go and give this
[24:07.720 --> 24:13.440]  vaccine to the entire world governments will have to be involved because there
[24:13.440 --> 24:19.560]  will be some risk and indemnification needed before that can be decided on
[24:19.560 --> 24:27.800]  well Bill since you try to warn us about this pandemic and we didn't listen
[24:27.800 --> 24:32.040]  what's the next thing you're warning us about that's going to happen five years
[24:32.040 --> 24:38.480]  from now that we're not listening to at the present well I I didn't want to be
[24:38.480 --> 24:44.000]  right what I wanted to do is I understand I'm not saying you won everybody loses
[24:44.000 --> 24:46.960]  nobody wins with us and I'm not saying that you're that you're this is not an
[24:46.960 --> 24:52.000]  end zone dance I'm just saying what else are we not listening to that we need to
[24:52.000 --> 24:59.960]  take action on now well the the idea of a a bioterrorist attack is kind of the
[24:59.960 --> 25:04.000]  nightmare scenario because they're a pathogen with a high death rate would be
[25:04.000 --> 25:10.720]  now the good news is okay the pressure is up too late now most the work we're
[25:10.720 --> 25:16.960]  gonna do to be ready for pandemic to I call this pandemic one most the work
[25:16.960 --> 25:22.160]  will do to be ready for that are also the things we need to do to minimize the
[25:22.160 --> 25:27.480]  threat of there folks it's all in of it 201 it's all in lockstep the Rockefeller
[25:27.480 --> 25:31.360]  Foundation this is just putting the handcuffs on you and locking you down
[25:31.360 --> 25:35.200]  and getting you ready for the national ID the global ID the implantable chip then
[25:35.200 --> 25:39.520]  the terror strike but thank God Bill Gates is there to make sure you take the
[25:39.520 --> 25:43.320]  next shot that lowers your immunity even more so that the next binary whether
[25:43.320 --> 25:47.040]  they release does kill you and your family and that is his plan and they'll
[25:47.040 --> 25:49.920]  probably kill me or put me in prison for doing this but I'm telling the truth so
[25:49.920 --> 25:52.840]  you know who killed you at least once once you're dying just remember who did
[25:52.840 --> 25:56.720]  it to you okay all right thanks I don't have to tell you that we are in the most
[25:56.720 --> 26:00.640]  important point in human history the globalists have taken the gloves off and
[26:00.640 --> 26:04.560]  they've taken the mask off and they're like yeah you're taking implantable chips
[26:04.560 --> 26:09.120]  yeah we're into pedophilia yeah we're into world government yeah you're
[26:09.120 --> 26:15.280]  obsolete you are not essential we are shutting your ass down yeah we told you
[26:15.280 --> 26:18.920]  don't be farmers and don't be ranchers and don't work at industry anymore
[26:18.920 --> 26:23.080]  you're gonna be the service economy and now the globalists are telling you that
[26:23.080 --> 26:27.280]  there's no more service economy and you're obsolete so you better bow down to
[26:27.280 --> 26:31.240]  them and get your universal pittance income so they can dictate your life
[26:31.240 --> 26:36.440]  the handcuffs are going on right now we have to resist and say no to the new
[26:36.440 --> 26:40.000]  world order and that takes you understanding you were right and
[26:40.000 --> 26:43.680]  understanding I was right and getting in people's faces and raising the alarm

[29:21.440 --> 29:39.640]  well there's a new article that just went live at news wars dot com and info
[29:39.640 --> 29:46.160]  wars dot com by Ron Paul Ron Paul authoritarians using coronavirus fear to
[29:46.160 --> 29:51.360]  destroy America his next article will be the sky is blue at high noon in
[29:51.360 --> 29:58.640]  Arizona yes it's all true another key report President Trump's betting on you
[29:58.640 --> 30:02.840]  needs to be seen needs to be shared only way the dog hunts is you take action
[30:02.840 --> 30:08.120]  Paul Joseph Watson joins us for the rest of the hour with summit dot news wanted
[30:08.120 --> 30:16.320]  to get Paul on because we see the UK flying in 15,000 people a day with no
[30:16.320 --> 30:20.120]  virus testing including travelers from China Italy in the US three of the
[30:20.120 --> 30:26.120]  supposedly hardest hit areas but then you're not supposed to leave your
[30:26.120 --> 30:30.200]  houses he wrote another article for info wars dot com thousands of people are
[30:30.200 --> 30:36.320]  dying at home due to the lockdown meanwhile Paul finds that nine out of ten
[30:36.320 --> 30:43.920]  in the UK want lockdown to carry on we'll be looking at those reports with
[30:43.920 --> 30:48.440]  Paul Joseph Watson and ask where he thinks this is going because we see
[30:48.440 --> 30:53.240]  numbers out of the UK at least 20 times 30 times depending on the study lower
[30:53.240 --> 30:57.640]  than what they said the death rate would be same thing in Canada same thing in
[30:57.640 --> 31:01.000]  the US same thing in Australia same thing in Germany but they call it
[31:01.000 --> 31:09.600]  explosions in cases five new coronavirus cases in Wuhan the most deadly
[31:09.600 --> 31:15.120]  in months it's the end of the world coronavirus spreads in Germany it
[31:15.120 --> 31:20.440]  accelerates no the truth is they're counting all the deaths from other
[31:20.440 --> 31:24.180]  things as COVID-19 they admit the test are fake a major biologist the
[31:24.180 --> 31:28.000]  president Tanzania sent off a papaya and a goat to the national testing lab
[31:28.000 --> 31:32.760]  run by the UN and they found it had coronavirus so now we know it's about
[31:32.760 --> 31:36.480]  shutting down the last it's about making sure we lose that trade war it's about
[31:36.480 --> 31:40.560]  bringing in the national global IDs it's about the force inoculations net and
[31:40.560 --> 31:44.520]  Yahoo proposes implantable chips for all the Israeli children this is the
[31:44.520 --> 31:48.920]  downbreaking this is the globalist takeover Paul Joseph Watson from London
[31:48.920 --> 31:54.800]  to describe what it's like to be in the month number two of the lockdown and the
[31:54.800 --> 31:58.440]  Tom Hanks and others are describing it like winning World War two everyone's
[31:58.440 --> 32:03.480]  heroes for staying in their houses is this true that nine out of ten folks in
[32:03.480 --> 32:10.120]  the UK want to want to stay locked in their houses buried alive yes it's true
[32:10.120 --> 32:14.720]  according to the polls Alec vast support for the lockdown to continue even
[32:14.720 --> 32:18.880]  beyond due line I bet if you ask a lot of these people they probably just want
[32:18.880 --> 32:23.800]  it to continue permanently Alex mainly because they're getting paid by the
[32:23.800 --> 32:27.600]  government this is like an insight into what universal basic income might be
[32:27.600 --> 32:32.920]  they're happy to take 80% of their check of their payment from the government to
[32:32.920 --> 32:37.480]  stay at home to sit on their backsides and do nothing even though this probably
[32:37.480 --> 32:40.760]  not going to be much of an economy to come back to and even though this whole
[32:40.760 --> 32:46.420]  thing is costing more lives than it is saving we were told that we had to
[32:46.420 --> 32:50.360]  endure this lockdown Alex which by the way I support at the start I could see
[32:50.360 --> 32:54.280]  the sense in limited lockdown for a short period of time we were told we
[32:54.280 --> 33:00.120]  needed to do it to stay at home save lives and protect the NHS okay the NHS
[33:00.120 --> 33:04.680]  National Health Service the over spill hospitals they built to deal with the
[33:04.680 --> 33:09.120]  coronavirus because they thought they told us the hospitals would be
[33:09.120 --> 33:14.160]  completely overwhelmed like they were in Italy half of them didn't even open
[33:14.160 --> 33:18.320]  they're closing down the remaining ones the cute hospital beds across the United
[33:18.320 --> 33:23.840]  Kingdom are four times emptier than normal and why is that because many of
[33:23.840 --> 33:29.120]  the people who are staying at home are cancer victims heart attack victims and
[33:29.120 --> 33:34.280]  stroke victims and you mentioned the article which we put out today at least
[33:34.280 --> 33:39.920]  10,000 excess deaths already due to people staying at home and not going into
[33:39.920 --> 33:43.680]  hospital for treatment either because the treatment is not available or because
[33:43.680 --> 33:48.560]  they're scared of the coronavirus you have cancer experts the professor of
[33:48.560 --> 33:53.200]  cancer at Kings College University Richard Sullivan saying there will be more
[33:53.200 --> 33:58.800]  excess cancer deaths than total coronavirus deaths across the United
[33:58.800 --> 34:04.640]  Kingdom and in fact an NHS consultant professor Carol Sakura has said that
[34:04.640 --> 34:10.160]  there will be 50,000 excess deaths from cancer as a result of screenings being
[34:10.160 --> 34:15.280]  suspended in the UK let's bear in mind Alex around I think it's the latest
[34:15.280 --> 34:21.400]  numbers about 32,000 COVID deaths in the UK but as you said we know the vast
[34:21.400 --> 34:26.920]  majority of those deaths are people with severe debilitating diseases illnesses
[34:26.920 --> 34:32.840]  who tragically enough would have died anyway but they're all counted as COVID
[34:32.840 --> 34:37.280]  deaths because it's a similar situation in America where the doctors actually
[34:37.280 --> 34:42.200]  get increased promises of funding if they count the death as a COVID death so
[34:42.200 --> 34:48.560]  you've got 50,000 excess cancer deaths you've already got 10,000 deaths so far
[34:48.560 --> 34:52.880]  just in the past six weeks alone because people who have strokes and heart
[34:52.880 --> 34:57.640]  attacks when they do call an ambulance they're waiting an hour two hours even
[34:57.640 --> 35:02.280]  three hours sometimes because of the supposed focus on coronavirus even though
[35:02.280 --> 35:07.720]  hospitals are half empty then you have the TB and we wrote about this last week
[35:07.720 --> 35:14.760]  1.4 million people Alex this is globally are going to die according to TB
[35:14.760 --> 35:20.800]  experts from tuberculosis 1.4 million because they couldn't get hospital
[35:20.800 --> 35:26.280]  treatment so the current global coronavirus death figure is the official
[35:26.280 --> 35:30.360]  figure anyway and again this is people many of them died with debilitating
[35:30.360 --> 35:35.640]  diseases that were more of a factor than coronavirus is 280,000 so even if that
[35:35.640 --> 35:39.880]  were to double total global coronavirus deaths that would still only
[35:39.880 --> 35:47.360]  represent one third of total TB deaths caused by these lockdowns we were told
[35:47.360 --> 35:53.400]  to lock down to save lives yet the very process of doing that is going to cause
[35:53.400 --> 36:01.160]  the loss of significantly more lives so what was the point Alex well Paul I'm
[36:01.160 --> 36:04.320]  not putting you on the spot because a lot of times you've been right and I've
[36:04.320 --> 36:09.360]  been wrong on let's say four or five big subjects so I really respect you but you
[36:09.360 --> 36:13.520]  remember two and a half months ago you're like Alex come on the hospitals
[36:13.520 --> 36:16.280]  aren't empty you better watch running these stories and I said no these are
[36:16.280 --> 36:19.680]  real people going out there I know it was hard to believe now they admit that's
[36:19.680 --> 36:24.840]  true Project Veritas has caught them staging actors going in caught them
[36:24.840 --> 36:28.960]  staging lines of cars I know that's hard to believe but they now admit they did
[36:28.960 --> 36:33.240]  it they got caught and so this whole thing had to be premeditated through the
[36:33.240 --> 36:36.880]  WHO as the authority through the National Health Service through the NIH
[36:36.880 --> 36:42.040]  through all the national health boards and it's all been concerted to hype it
[36:42.040 --> 36:45.920]  up to not open the economy to tell us only two weeks so the hospitals don't
[36:45.920 --> 36:50.800]  get overwhelmed then we're told oh actually two months two years it never
[36:50.800 --> 36:56.320]  ends and and so the handcuffs were put on us we were set up I wasn't sure three
[36:56.320 --> 37:00.640]  months ago how deadly it really was and so I was saying hey we better get ready
[37:00.640 --> 37:03.560]  because it looks really bad but it looks like they may use it as a way to lock
[37:03.560 --> 37:07.040]  down and then blame Trump and then try to throw him out of office well now the
[37:07.040 --> 37:10.720]  Democrats admit that's their whole way of running now you can say well it's
[37:10.720 --> 37:14.480]  don't let a good crisis go to waste like Hillary said about COVID-19 regardless
[37:14.480 --> 37:17.840]  they're using it to keep things locked down they're using it for a total
[37:17.840 --> 37:22.480]  takeover what do you think's really behind this whole thing I think it's
[37:22.480 --> 37:26.520]  creating the the precedent to have these powers become permanent where the
[37:26.520 --> 37:31.200]  government says jump and you say how high which is why yesterday during Boris
[37:31.200 --> 37:35.680]  Johnson's announcement he's introduced this kind of George W. Bush style
[37:35.680 --> 37:41.200]  color-coded alert level system and they say if it's you know if it ticks above
[37:41.200 --> 37:45.200]  two then we have to reimpose these measures so of course that makes it
[37:45.200 --> 37:49.920]  that color-coded alert is now going to become permanent so they can lower it
[37:49.920 --> 37:53.920]  they can raise it whenever they want people to start obeying and think of
[37:53.920 --> 37:57.920]  the perfect plan this is martial law click of a button flip of a switch
[37:57.920 --> 38:00.960]  you just whenever you want you just say oh there's a deadly virus or there's a
[38:00.960 --> 38:05.040]  problem stay in your homes and all the sudden out of a black mirror episode
[38:05.040 --> 38:10.480]  here are the robots enforcing it yeah which of course gives the government
[38:10.480 --> 38:16.320]  de facto permission to criminalize any protest whatsoever by declaring a
[38:16.320 --> 38:20.240]  coronavirus alert in the few days before and even if the current government
[38:20.240 --> 38:24.160]  is not going to abuse that power an infinite number of future governments
[38:24.160 --> 38:26.560]  could meanwhile you have people Alex literally
[38:26.560 --> 38:31.120]  overlapping obeying worshiping the NHS every Thursday at 8 p.m.
[38:31.120 --> 38:35.680]  then they all go out and cram the parks and violate social distancing it's
[38:35.680 --> 38:39.760]  complete hypocrisy they're doing it for social media cloud just with the
[38:39.760 --> 38:43.600]  like the dancing tiktok nurses we're going to show all that video when we
[38:43.600 --> 38:47.040]  come back and your robot enforcers and babies being ripped out of women's
[38:47.040 --> 38:50.240]  arms from germany to australia when they dare leave their houses without
[38:50.240 --> 38:53.360]  authorization but all the bureaucrats they do whatever they want
[38:53.360 --> 38:56.800]  i'm always excited about info wars life products they're amazing they're cutting
[38:56.800 --> 39:00.000]  edge you love them i love them and they fund the info war in the face of the
[39:00.000 --> 39:03.360]  globalist onslaught but we have come up with a new
[39:03.360 --> 39:08.480]  product over a year in development that is amazing
[39:08.480 --> 39:12.720]  the only organic hand sanitizer on the market
[39:12.720 --> 39:17.200]  with organic essential oils on top of it and there's another
[39:17.200 --> 39:22.960]  innovation it's the spray cap it doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick
[39:22.960 --> 39:27.280]  gross goo but it's high quality it aerosolizes it
[39:27.280 --> 39:31.280]  in a really great way i like to put on my hands rub a little bit on my face
[39:31.280 --> 39:34.960]  it's got organic alcohol in it so spray it right in your eyes but i just
[39:34.960 --> 39:38.480]  love it personally has something that's a moisturizer as well
[39:38.480 --> 39:41.920]  show this is a real innovation i don't know why others didn't think of coming
[39:41.920 --> 39:45.760]  out with a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it so it
[39:45.760 --> 39:50.000]  doesn't dry you out smells great it's so refreshing
[39:50.000 --> 39:55.120]  this is a big winner i was talking to my wife tonight and i was
[39:55.120 --> 39:58.640]  saying our economy slowing down and shutting down is like
[39:58.640 --> 40:01.920]  shooting a deer and it runs a hundred yards before it
[40:01.920 --> 40:05.280]  knows it's been shot and then it finally dies she said well yeah
[40:05.280 --> 40:09.520]  when i grew up in Omaha Nebraska one time there was an argument in the street
[40:09.520 --> 40:13.280]  and another man shot another man in the head and the man that got shot in the
[40:13.280 --> 40:17.520]  head had blood pouring out a huge hole he was holding it he walked around
[40:17.520 --> 40:20.720]  gibbering talking nonsense for about 60 seconds
[40:20.720 --> 40:25.040]  and then just fell over dead well that's what's gonna happen with our economy
[40:25.040 --> 40:28.880]  it is in cardiac arrest this has been done by design
[40:28.880 --> 40:32.720]  and the un the chai comms the mainstream media orchestrated it
[40:32.720 --> 40:36.560]  hyped it and tried to keep the economy closed so remember
[40:36.560 --> 40:39.920]  the depression that's coming and the third world collapse is all on
[40:39.920 --> 40:44.400]  the un on billa melinda gates on obama on hillary
[40:44.400 --> 40:48.400]  on biden on the democrats we tried to stop it we tried to fight it but you
[40:48.400 --> 40:52.240]  guys said you wanted to wreck america and the world and now you've done it
[40:52.240 --> 40:55.840]  congratulations i don't like coming to you every day
[40:55.840 --> 40:59.120]  on the radio and tv stations that you watch and listen to a song and telling
[40:59.120 --> 41:02.400]  you all these horrible things but you notice almost everything we've
[41:02.400 --> 41:06.480]  talked about horrible has come true we were warning everybody
[41:06.480 --> 41:10.000]  to try to stop it it's like telling somebody if you
[41:10.000 --> 41:13.280]  got a pool put a fence around it if you have little kids
[41:13.280 --> 41:16.080]  because even if they're good swimmers they can hit their head and drown
[41:16.080 --> 41:19.040]  people don't listen they go out and their kids dead in the pool
[41:19.040 --> 41:21.760]  well ladies and gentlemen this is the death of the third world and the
[41:21.760 --> 41:24.960]  collapse of the first world and this is 21st century
[41:24.960 --> 41:28.480]  warfare carried out by the globalist and they admit
[41:28.480 --> 41:32.240]  they've orchestrated it they admit it's quote good to save the earth
[41:32.240 --> 41:35.600]  and they're teaching us to be more frugal and they want to make us poor so
[41:35.600 --> 41:38.560]  they can dictate our surrender to this post-human
[41:38.560 --> 41:42.000]  technocracy i know all this sounds insane when i was
[41:42.000 --> 41:45.760]  talking about it 25 years ago but now it's public because it's their
[41:45.760 --> 41:48.880]  operations manual i wish this wasn't the case
[41:48.880 --> 41:52.640]  but they're really our evil psychopaths in control of most major institutions
[41:52.640 --> 41:56.560]  that we've got to stop them it took hundreds and hundreds of years of
[41:56.560 --> 41:59.680]  human civilization to build up the world economy
[41:59.680 --> 42:03.120]  to where it is every economist is on record saying
[42:03.120 --> 42:06.880]  that as this economy has been shut down for two months
[42:06.880 --> 42:09.280]  it is going to be a death sentence to the third world
[42:09.280 --> 42:12.960]  and a horrible nightmarish collapse for the first world
[42:12.960 --> 42:16.960]  and that the general public is going to go into deep deep debt to the mega banks
[42:16.960 --> 42:20.960]  they're not going to have medical ID cards forced inoculations we are
[42:20.960 --> 42:26.320]  now in a giant dystopia but a lot of people are waking up
[42:26.320 --> 42:30.640]  and there is a major backlash taking place against this tyranny
[42:30.640 --> 42:34.960]  and we must all rediscover our bill of rights rediscover our constitution and
[42:34.960 --> 42:38.080]  our backbone and start saying no to people who
[42:38.080 --> 42:41.840]  take this moral high ground and say shut your business down shut your life
[42:41.840 --> 42:45.200]  down it'll save lives no it's caused millions to
[42:45.200 --> 42:48.640]  already starve to death tens of millions more so the cowards who went
[42:48.640 --> 42:51.840]  along with this with your virtues signaling you have destroyed your lives
[42:51.840 --> 42:55.520]  and our lives congratulations
[42:57.200 --> 43:01.920]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[43:01.920 --> 43:04.960]  you
[43:15.520 --> 43:18.720]  welcome back i'm alex jones your host paul joseph wants to know some of that news
[43:18.720 --> 43:23.360]  is our guest here today and i'm sure you've seen the countless videos of
[43:23.360 --> 43:27.360]  police officers beating up innocent citizens around the streets of
[43:27.360 --> 43:31.680]  germany or new york city in the united states or
[43:31.680 --> 43:36.080]  sydney australia meanwhile ph sheriffs refused to enforce business
[43:36.080 --> 43:39.920]  shut down they say all businesses are essential
[43:39.920 --> 43:44.320]  how can only big box stores stay open but let's go ahead and roll footage with
[43:44.320 --> 43:49.120]  the audio australian police ripped terrified child from mother
[43:49.120 --> 43:53.120]  for protesting lockdown i guess australia a lot of great people
[43:53.120 --> 43:59.360]  but it always was a prisoner colony kind of like uh
[43:59.360 --> 44:02.640]  hawaii's a beautiful state but it's still under martial law
[44:02.640 --> 44:06.960]  that's why they're totally locked down this is totally sick or it's the police
[44:06.960 --> 44:10.080]  aren't wearing masks they all know it's a fraud but they follow
[44:10.080 --> 44:14.160]  their illegal orders here's that video
[44:14.160 --> 44:18.160]  i was going to say that
[44:21.760 --> 44:26.160]  obviously police aren't wearing masks either but they're god
[44:34.560 --> 44:39.520]  screaming mother with her child being on the streets disappearing
[44:39.520 --> 44:44.960]  with the child getting used to these images
[44:46.320 --> 44:52.640]  this was all premeditated rock and fellers foundation the ford
[44:52.640 --> 44:55.600]  foundation the bill millen gates foundation they all said they'd use
[44:55.600 --> 44:59.040]  a global pandemic to bring in the castle society the surveillance
[44:59.040 --> 45:03.440]  the force inoculations and it's here so it is on purpose it is by design
[45:03.440 --> 45:07.200]  and you know i'm not attacking jack pasoba he's a smart guy and i
[45:07.200 --> 45:11.680]  i like jack but he put out this tweet he's put out a
[45:11.680 --> 45:14.480]  bunch of these and and so i make a film about this which we're making very
[45:14.480 --> 45:17.040]  very quickly this is going to be part of the film
[45:17.040 --> 45:21.760]  to be clear COVID-19 is not a deep state soros bill gates population control
[45:21.760 --> 45:24.960]  conspiracy oh the cia term conspiracy theory
[45:24.960 --> 45:31.120]  there is no evidence of this whatsoever it is a virus a terrible global virus
[45:31.120 --> 45:36.400]  that g's china tried to cover up well i mean they admit it came out of wuhan i
[45:36.400 --> 45:39.840]  reported that three months ago i i broke it all but but
[45:39.840 --> 45:43.120]  we're being told that there just is no proof authoritatively
[45:43.120 --> 45:47.600]  just stated like the great and powerful laws well
[45:47.600 --> 45:51.200]  this is going to be what we just proved in the film right here
[45:51.200 --> 45:54.480]  and all the other mainstream media beautifully telling us that he's not
[45:54.480 --> 45:57.840]  even connected to wuhan either is Fauci it's all a conspiracy
[45:57.840 --> 46:01.760]  don't look into that don't look into Fauci don't look into Fauci
[46:01.760 --> 46:05.040]  don't look into Fauci we're going to put your ass in prison jones
[46:05.040 --> 46:07.600]  go ahead
[46:08.240 --> 46:13.360]  because i'm worried about god not you paul joseph watson
[46:13.360 --> 46:16.880]  i have the article here u.s risking a second wave
[46:16.880 --> 46:20.640]  and a depression mark zandy says of moody's
[46:20.640 --> 46:25.840]  and he says if we don't stay locked down there'll be mass death and then the
[46:25.840 --> 46:29.040]  economy will have a depression but these very same people continue that are
[46:29.040 --> 46:31.280]  telling us stay locked down we're all dead
[46:31.280 --> 46:34.560]  are the ones that we keep learning are betting against the stock market paul
[46:34.560 --> 46:38.160]  joseph watson it's simple math you stay locked down
[46:38.160 --> 46:41.840]  we have a global depression you open up we don't have a depression paul joseph
[46:41.840 --> 46:45.680]  watson yeah this this whole second wave
[46:45.680 --> 46:50.240]  beamongering is based on the r-rate which is the rate of reinfection the
[46:50.240 --> 46:54.960]  rate of infection for coronavirus no government knows the r-rate
[46:54.960 --> 46:58.960]  because nobody knows how many people in any given country are infected with
[46:58.960 --> 47:03.200]  coronavirus so the uk's entire model which is when they
[47:03.200 --> 47:07.360]  say oh when the r-rate gets above one then we can
[47:07.360 --> 47:11.360]  reimpose lockdown they don't know what the r-rate is
[47:11.360 --> 47:15.120]  it's speculative it's complete speculation because they don't know how
[47:15.120 --> 47:18.560]  many people are infected with the virus so their entire
[47:18.560 --> 47:23.440]  strategy of oh if there's a second wave if the r-number goes back above one we
[47:23.440 --> 47:27.360]  have to reimpose these measures nobody knows what that figure is
[47:27.360 --> 47:30.480]  so again it's complete bs and then you look at sweden alex
[47:30.480 --> 47:34.880]  you look at japan you look at belarus countries which did not impose
[47:34.880 --> 47:39.040]  lockdowns sweden now has largely
[47:39.040 --> 47:41.920]  herd immunity without having to destroy their economy
[47:41.920 --> 47:45.680]  without tens of thousands of potential cancer victims not getting treatment
[47:45.680 --> 47:49.120]  without stroke heart attack victims not getting treatment
[47:49.120 --> 47:53.440]  they did not impose a lockdown they have a lower death rate per capita
[47:53.440 --> 47:58.560]  than the uk they have a lower r-rate infection rate compared to the uk
[47:58.560 --> 48:02.960]  you can look at japan population 126 million
[48:02.960 --> 48:06.080]  compared to the uk's population which is 66 million
[48:06.080 --> 48:12.480]  we've had 32 000 covid deaths they've had 624 they had international air
[48:12.480 --> 48:16.800]  traffic coming in at just as we did they didn't lock down
[48:16.800 --> 48:21.520]  so again new studies now coming out alex show that this social distancing
[48:21.520 --> 48:26.000]  that you have to be in extremely close proximity with somebody for an extended
[48:26.000 --> 48:29.760]  period of time to have the virus be transmitted
[48:29.760 --> 48:32.960]  studies showing that social distancing had no
[48:32.960 --> 48:36.800]  impact on the rates of deaths the rates of infections yet
[48:36.800 --> 48:40.800]  they haven't updated the science our entire model in the uk
[48:40.800 --> 48:45.200]  was based on this prediction by professor neil ferguson imperial college
[48:45.200 --> 48:50.080]  that half a million people would die this same guy's predictions
[48:50.080 --> 48:53.840]  for foot and mouth disease for SARS for all these other epidemics
[48:53.840 --> 48:57.280]  were used by uk governments going back 10 15 years
[48:57.280 --> 49:01.440]  they were all spectacularly wrong yet this is the guy
[49:01.440 --> 49:05.040]  the authority that has been used for the model not only for the uk
[49:05.040 --> 49:09.040]  but for countries like south africa we had the article last week
[49:09.040 --> 49:14.400]  experts now say the lockdown will cause 29 times more deaths
[49:14.400 --> 49:18.160]  than coronavirus in south africa based on this
[49:18.160 --> 49:22.480]  debunked ridiculous model from a guy who's been spectacularly wrong
[49:22.480 --> 49:27.520]  time and time again the same guy by the way who violated his own lockdown to
[49:27.520 --> 49:31.280]  have his married mistress mother of two come visit him
[49:31.280 --> 49:36.000]  for some hanky panky so he took it that seriously that he broke it himself at
[49:36.000 --> 49:40.560]  the first opportunity absolutely incredible
[49:41.200 --> 49:46.560]  paul again i've got all the graphs here california had
[49:46.560 --> 49:51.520]  120th or less the number of deaths they projected
[49:51.520 --> 49:55.520]  but they have headlines out california worse than expected
[49:55.520 --> 50:01.040]  california level spike and it's just totally made up
[50:01.040 --> 50:04.480]  the graph was way up here now it's way down here because there's a tiny little
[50:04.480 --> 50:09.520]  bump they go oh look it'd be like if you had a weatherman
[50:09.520 --> 50:14.560]  out in the mojave desert and there's no clouds in the sky and he's on the news
[50:14.560 --> 50:17.440]  saying tomorrow we're gonna have 20 inches of
[50:17.440 --> 50:21.040]  rain and giant thunderstorms for a month and you have a month of no
[50:21.040 --> 50:26.640]  precipitation totally blue skies and still the weatherman's on
[50:26.640 --> 50:29.840]  but the weatherman tells you don't leave your house because of the floods
[50:29.840 --> 50:33.200]  so everybody's staying in their houses you look outside it's sunny
[50:33.200 --> 50:36.400]  but nobody goes out because the weatherman says there's tornadoes
[50:36.400 --> 50:40.640]  and floods and Noah's Ark that's the level of this hoax and now the
[50:40.640 --> 50:45.200]  weatherman says to leave your house you gotta have a microchip in your body
[50:45.200 --> 50:49.920]  i mean this is getting crazy Benjamin yet in yahoo
[50:49.920 --> 50:53.440]  is saying you know put microchips in kids and we're showing sweden right now
[50:53.440 --> 50:56.880]  you can show california you can show the uk you can show canada
[50:56.880 --> 50:59.840]  you can show the us it's all the same the graph looks the same
[50:59.840 --> 51:03.520]  they're way up here prediction we're way down here
[51:03.520 --> 51:09.040]  but then they call ills and valleys of supposed covid
[51:09.040 --> 51:13.040]  they call that the ups they report on the ups of that when all it is is them
[51:13.040 --> 51:16.480]  reporting normal people that died of pre-existing
[51:16.480 --> 51:20.720]  conditions paul this is the biggest hoax on the planet's ever seen
[51:20.720 --> 51:24.560]  my god where do you think this is going how do we stop this
[51:24.560 --> 51:28.240]  i mean it's it's going to having mandatory government apps on your phone
[51:28.240 --> 51:31.520]  that listen to your conversations we know we've already got the
[51:31.520 --> 51:34.000]  technology for that and the microchip which is what they've
[51:34.000 --> 51:38.880]  what they've proposed the fact is there's somebody did a study
[51:38.880 --> 51:43.360]  eight people under the age of 19 die in the uk every year
[51:43.360 --> 51:47.120]  from putting their trousers on that's the same number of
[51:47.120 --> 51:50.960]  people under the age of 19 who have died from covid in the uk
[51:50.960 --> 51:55.760]  you had the director the department of public of health dr isiki
[51:55.760 --> 51:59.520]  come out and say quote it means technically even if you died of a
[51:59.520 --> 52:02.880]  clear alternate cause but you had covid at the same time
[52:02.880 --> 52:07.600]  it's still listed as a covid death she admitted to it
[52:07.600 --> 52:12.480]  there's a meme man killed by shark dies of coronavirus that's literally what it
[52:12.480 --> 52:16.320]  is the vast majority of these people would tragically have died anyway
[52:16.320 --> 52:20.240]  they're all being counted as covid deaths there needs to be a separation
[52:20.240 --> 52:24.960]  in the data of those deaths but no they're not doing it because it's the
[52:24.960 --> 52:29.520]  same big pharma that funds the nih and funds the national health service and
[52:29.520 --> 52:32.800]  funds the un that has the giant power grab do five more
[52:32.800 --> 52:36.000]  minutes with us paul joseph watson i want to cover another subject

[54:06.400 --> 54:09.600]  because we're not putting a filter in front of three minds
[54:09.600 --> 54:13.280]  we're having an open discussion about the real state of the world
[54:13.280 --> 54:16.640]  not the establishment of talking points that are put out by the council on

[54:19.520 --> 54:24.960]  and other club we're pushing for a pro human future where we build a planet
[54:24.960 --> 54:28.960]  and beyond based on humans or humans by humans
[54:28.960 --> 54:32.320]  not a world where the establishment hate themselves

[55:47.200 --> 55:52.080]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[55:52.080 --> 56:00.160]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[56:00.160 --> 56:06.800]  so now mainline reporters that just do stories covering the different
[56:06.800 --> 56:09.520]  ideas and theories about where covet 19 came from
[56:09.520 --> 56:12.960]  because the evidence amounts it was made in the lab and released on purpose
[56:12.960 --> 56:16.800]  are being blocked by youtube facebook and twitter now twitter announced last
[56:16.800 --> 56:19.920]  week that they're going to be blocking tweets in live time with ai
[56:19.920 --> 56:23.280]  before you can even send them out and a bunch of people i've talked to
[56:23.280 --> 56:26.320]  like millie weaver katelyn Bennett and others
[56:26.320 --> 56:31.360]  are trying to just put out reports and if they say hydroxychloroquine
[56:31.360 --> 56:34.240]  anywhere in there just covering what trump says
[56:34.240 --> 56:37.760]  they're not allowed to upload it so this is the total
[56:37.760 --> 56:42.160]  censorship but in the uk paul watson's written for summit.news
[56:42.160 --> 56:46.800]  they are now sending people to your house including nizal forage
[56:46.800 --> 56:51.920]  the shadow prime minister the man behind boris johnson
[56:51.920 --> 56:56.160]  because he dared as a journalist go show where the muslims are still invading
[56:56.160 --> 57:01.680]  at the coastline this is total tyranny this is the power grab
[57:01.680 --> 57:05.120]  this is the great leap forward of the post-human era
[57:05.120 --> 57:07.760]  paul watson tell us about the latest developments in the uk that we know is a
[57:07.760 --> 57:11.200]  beta test well of course over the past few
[57:11.200 --> 57:14.720]  weeks we've had numerous stories about police using surveillance drones to
[57:14.720 --> 57:19.360]  harass and publicly shame people for walking their dogs in remote areas of
[57:19.360 --> 57:21.680]  the countryside they were very proud about that
[57:21.680 --> 57:26.720]  we had numerous reports of people having their shopping bags inspected
[57:26.720 --> 57:31.040]  and in one case in fact several cases if you'd purchased wine
[57:31.040 --> 57:35.520]  or snacks crisps chips stuff like that they said they claimed that was an
[57:35.520 --> 57:39.680]  inessential purchase completely in a complete
[57:39.680 --> 57:43.760]  misunderstanding of the law any shop that's open is selling
[57:43.760 --> 57:46.640]  essential goods so anything and that's because the police are
[57:46.640 --> 57:50.960]  rabid communist globalist enforcers yeah and now
[57:50.960 --> 57:55.600]  i put up this article on saturday they're investigating people who make
[57:55.600 --> 57:59.280]  tweets dissenting against social distancing and lockdown
[57:59.280 --> 58:01.920]  somebody who was quite vehement in doing so
[58:01.920 --> 58:06.400]  notice that after he had tweeted critical messages against the police the
[58:06.400 --> 58:09.280]  law he went on to his linkedin profile and it
[58:09.280 --> 58:13.360]  said he had nine visits from the metropolitan police
[58:13.360 --> 58:17.840]  so we've literally got a hundred thousand people from foreign countries
[58:17.840 --> 58:21.280]  still landing at uk airports with no health checks
[58:21.280 --> 58:25.280]  no quarantine they only just changed that law now coming straight into the
[58:25.280 --> 58:28.800]  country dispersing amongst the transport system
[58:28.800 --> 58:33.600]  no checks whatsoever we've got record numbers of boat migrants
[58:33.600 --> 58:37.760]  coming in from france from calais into dover into the south coast
[58:37.760 --> 58:41.040]  with the government again acting as a taxi service
[58:41.040 --> 58:44.080]  to rescue them and bring them into the country
[58:44.080 --> 58:48.560]  meanwhile we're under house arrest meanwhile nijal forage goes and reports
[58:48.560 --> 58:52.560]  on it takes a cameraman talked as a two minute piece to camera
[58:52.560 --> 58:55.280]  the day after he gets a visit from the police
[58:55.280 --> 58:59.840]  even though he's part of the media he's got a national newspaper column
[58:59.840 --> 59:03.600]  he's a national syndicator radio host with lbc
[59:03.600 --> 59:06.960]  that is under the government's own law an essential
[59:06.960 --> 59:11.760]  key worker he's in the media yet he still gets a visit from the police warning
[59:11.760 --> 59:14.560]  him not to do that he said he's going to ignore that warning
[59:14.560 --> 59:18.880]  and again that's because of people tackling on him you also have alex
[59:18.880 --> 59:23.200]  this kind of new high priest class of the people who are wearing the masks
[59:23.200 --> 59:26.320]  and it's become this kind of status symbol of them being better than you
[59:26.320 --> 59:29.920]  because they're obeying the law better than you and they get to preach
[59:29.920 --> 59:34.000]  that you're not obeying social distancing funny thing is
[59:34.000 --> 59:39.040]  over the entire uk people are noticing these ppe these masks are being just
[59:39.040 --> 59:43.040]  thrown on the floor as litter across the entire country
[59:43.040 --> 59:47.600]  potentially infecting anyone who picks them up so the people who are so
[59:47.600 --> 59:51.120]  you know uptight about not spreading the disease
[59:51.120 --> 59:56.160]  once they've done with the mass are just discarding it's all virtue signaling
[59:56.160 --> 1:00:00.000]  it's all virtue signaling crap isn't the key though the unzoned admission that
[1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:03.600]  100 million or second star 30 million right now and pointing out to their
[1:00:03.600 --> 1:00:06.080]  face you're causing mass collapse worldwide
[1:00:06.080 --> 1:00:10.800]  while you sit her on welfare and we've got to get back to work paul
[1:00:10.800 --> 1:00:15.120]  yeah but there is that the lockdown is causing mass death it's going to cause
[1:00:15.120 --> 1:00:19.040]  1.4 million tv deaths across the whole world
[1:00:19.040 --> 1:00:23.360]  because people can't get treatment the lockdown is the mass killer
[1:00:23.360 --> 1:00:27.280]  way more than coronavirus right all the experts who are not getting much media
[1:00:27.280 --> 1:00:30.880]  play but they're saying this or desperately trying to warn people of
[1:00:30.880 --> 1:00:34.320]  not fact well that's right the media goes covet 19 causing global starvation
[1:00:34.320 --> 1:00:38.480]  no the lockdown is summit dot news all joseph watson thank you so much for
[1:00:38.480 --> 1:00:42.400]  joining us thanks ellis stay with us your phone
[1:00:42.400 --> 1:00:46.480]  calls a ton of news and then david ike on the most censored broadcast in the
[1:00:46.480 --> 1:00:49.360]  world whatever you do don't spread the word
[1:00:49.360 --> 1:00:55.600]  lay down and die i've hunted a lot of big game at long distances with high
[1:00:55.600 --> 1:00:59.200]  caliber rifles and when you shoot an l could say
[1:00:59.200 --> 1:01:02.240]  600 yards even if you hit them right in the heart
[1:01:02.240 --> 1:01:08.720]  they'll still run 50 60 70 maybe 100 yards they've got that adrenaline
[1:01:08.720 --> 1:01:12.160]  pumping through their arteries and through their veins but all the sudden
[1:01:12.160 --> 1:01:15.120]  they slow down they realize what's happened
[1:01:15.120 --> 1:01:18.960]  they fall over and they die then you go bag them and
[1:01:18.960 --> 1:01:24.000]  haul them back in well that's what's going to happen to the entire world now
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:28.400]  and that's what the economic numbers show is that we've been shot
[1:01:28.400 --> 1:01:32.240]  right in the heart and for the first world it's going to mean a long
[1:01:32.240 --> 1:01:36.240]  horrible depression and a lot of death well for the third world it's going to
[1:01:36.240 --> 1:01:38.960]  mean probably over 100 million dead according to you and i believe their
[1:01:38.960 --> 1:01:42.960]  numbers because it's the very un that's orchestrated this to
[1:01:42.960 --> 1:01:46.160]  depopulate the third world so that all the leftists that thought it was their
[1:01:46.160 --> 1:01:49.440]  revolution to get rid of trump you're a bunch of suckers and you bought into
[1:01:49.440 --> 1:02:04.560]  something better than what hitler did
[1:02:04.560 --> 1:02:09.280]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide
[1:02:09.280 --> 1:02:14.560]  it's alex jones
[1:02:14.560 --> 1:02:19.600]  well you know bill melinda gates's patent to track you by microchip or arm bracelet
[1:02:19.600 --> 1:02:22.480]  to buy and sell under covet 19 they have another patent
[1:02:22.480 --> 1:02:27.280]  to put an implantable chip in your skin that's ink inside the vaccine
[1:02:27.280 --> 1:02:31.280]  well now a bill has been introduced for 100 billion dollars by the democrats
[1:02:31.280 --> 1:02:34.720]  to have contract tracers that track and trace and enforce
[1:02:34.720 --> 1:02:38.640]  the next wave of the lockdowns that are coming and the big bio attack
[1:02:38.640 --> 1:02:41.760]  that is phase two that bill gates says is coming
[1:02:41.760 --> 1:02:45.280]  and believe me he should know this is just a drill
[1:02:45.280 --> 1:02:48.720]  to make sure you shelter in place and die inside your home
[1:02:48.720 --> 1:02:52.800]  when they launch the real bio attack all the evidence shows but this powerful
[1:02:52.800 --> 1:02:56.800]  report is on band out video there's a new bill that has 666
[1:02:56.800 --> 1:03:03.120]  in the title they seem to always do this that's hr 6666 the bill of the beast
[1:03:03.120 --> 1:03:06.960]  here it is the world health organization recommended
[1:03:06.960 --> 1:03:10.240]  forcibly removing family members from their homes
[1:03:10.240 --> 1:03:14.160]  and putting them in quarantine now we need to go
[1:03:14.160 --> 1:03:17.840]  and look in families to find those people who may be sick
[1:03:17.840 --> 1:03:22.720]  and remove them and isolate them in a in a safe and dignified manner
[1:03:22.720 --> 1:03:26.560]  queen elizabeth seemed to be echoing this idea to the uk
[1:03:26.560 --> 1:03:29.840]  it reminds me of the very first broadcast i made
[1:03:29.840 --> 1:03:36.400]  in 1940 helped by my sister we as children spoke from here at
[1:03:36.400 --> 1:03:40.640]  winsor the children who had been evacuated from their homes
[1:03:40.640 --> 1:03:48.160]  and sent away for their own safety today once again many will feel a painful
[1:03:48.160 --> 1:03:52.080]  sense of separation from their loved ones
[1:03:52.080 --> 1:03:57.680]  but now as then we know deep down that it is the right thing to do
[1:03:57.680 --> 1:04:02.800]  bill gates has been pushing the idea of tracking people with digital tattoos
[1:04:02.800 --> 1:04:08.960]  and microsoft was recently granted patent number 0600606
[1:04:08.960 --> 1:04:14.720]  for a cryptocurrency surveillance system connected to the human body
[1:04:14.720 --> 1:04:23.360]  now enter hr 6666 to authorize the secretary of health and human services
[1:04:23.360 --> 1:04:27.200]  to award grants to eligible entities to conduct
[1:04:27.200 --> 1:04:31.680]  diagnostic testing for covid 19 and related activities
[1:04:31.680 --> 1:04:36.000]  such as contact tracing through mobile health units

[1:04:39.760 --> 1:04:44.240]  and for other purposes on may 1st of 2020
[1:04:44.240 --> 1:04:51.200]  Illinois congressman bobby rush introduced hr 6666 this act is
[1:04:51.200 --> 1:04:54.640]  essentially setting up a nationwide contact tracing and
[1:04:54.640 --> 1:04:58.400]  quarantine program run by big pharma
[1:04:58.400 --> 1:05:02.480]  section 2 covid 19 testing and contact tracing
[1:05:02.480 --> 1:05:06.320]  using mobile health units will allow bill gates loyalist
[1:05:06.320 --> 1:05:13.200]  alex azar and the cdc to fund eligible entities to conduct tests

[1:05:17.040 --> 1:05:20.640]  and to support the quarantine of these contacts
[1:05:20.640 --> 1:05:26.240]  via mobile health units who are the eligible entities qualified to receive
[1:05:26.240 --> 1:05:30.480]  this funding health centers nonprofit organizations
[1:05:30.480 --> 1:05:35.600]  high schools and anyone else that alex azar deems eligible
[1:05:35.600 --> 1:05:39.840]  the amount of taxpayer dollars being asked for to trace the public and force
[1:05:39.840 --> 1:05:44.400]  quarantines is 100 billion dollars for 2020 alone
[1:05:44.400 --> 1:05:50.080]  and whatever may be necessary as long as the emergency period continues
[1:05:50.080 --> 1:05:54.560]  for info wars dot com this is greg reese
[1:05:54.560 --> 1:05:58.160]  by the way if you want to see his amazing reports
[1:05:58.160 --> 1:06:01.840]  you simply go to band on video click on the left hand corner
[1:06:01.840 --> 1:06:06.880]  go to the greg reese section and you can see all of those reports there the
[1:06:06.880 --> 1:06:12.480]  average report has about 170 000 views which is a real shame
[1:06:12.480 --> 1:06:16.720]  they need to be seen by millions and millions and millions of people
[1:06:16.720 --> 1:06:20.160]  they're absolutely critical he's got a big one he's getting ready
[1:06:20.160 --> 1:06:25.600]  that we're going to air in the second segment of the fourth hour today and
[1:06:25.600 --> 1:06:28.880]  then Gerald Salente will take over into the
[1:06:28.880 --> 1:06:33.360]  war room with Owen shroyer this is causing a worldwide meltdown
[1:06:33.360 --> 1:06:36.240]  now hollywood and the globalists admit oh it's for the earth
[1:06:36.240 --> 1:06:39.760]  it's good to have the lockdown you're never going to have your job again
[1:06:39.760 --> 1:06:43.280]  first they told you that industry and farming was bad that you would be a
[1:06:43.280 --> 1:06:46.960]  service person that would be the new economy now that they got you
[1:06:46.960 --> 1:06:50.800]  to be obsolete they're replacing you with robots
[1:06:50.800 --> 1:06:54.320]  and saying don't worry you'll get a universal income
[1:06:54.320 --> 1:06:58.080]  that's a pittance but you got to take the vaccines you got to do what we say
[1:06:58.080 --> 1:07:03.440]  now the new dna vaccines go into your cells and reprogram them
[1:07:03.440 --> 1:07:11.760]  at the cellular level that's called cancer and it's so incredibly dangerous
[1:07:11.760 --> 1:07:18.080]  meanwhile 1.4 million people to die from untreated tb due to coronavirus
[1:07:18.080 --> 1:07:21.920]  lockdown scientists in brazil have found that countries most affected by the
[1:07:21.920 --> 1:07:25.120]  coronavirus spread are the ones continue to allow unrestricted travel
[1:07:25.120 --> 1:07:28.160]  across their borders prompting further arguments that the most effective
[1:07:28.160 --> 1:07:31.760]  method of preventing was spread is tighter frontier controls the research
[1:07:31.760 --> 1:07:36.800]  carried out by the federal university of salvador suggests that screening and
[1:07:36.800 --> 1:07:39.280]  quarantining those coming into countries from the outside
[1:07:39.280 --> 1:07:43.280]  could be the best way but that goes into break down the fact that
[1:07:43.280 --> 1:07:47.200]  tb now is exploding and because of people not getting
[1:07:47.200 --> 1:07:50.320]  treatment from it they estimate 1.4 million additional
[1:07:50.320 --> 1:07:55.120]  will die in fact even the one in guardian has reported that as well
[1:07:55.120 --> 1:07:59.440]  so let's go ahead and look at the facts why are 15 000 people a day flying into
[1:07:59.440 --> 1:08:03.440]  the uk unrestricted untested because it's all a hoax
[1:08:03.440 --> 1:08:10.000]  they count all normal deaths from cancer or heart attacks or other diseases
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:15.280]  in the column that's all admitted i keep harping on that because
[1:08:15.280 --> 1:08:21.040]  this is designed to bring down our economy
[1:08:21.040 --> 1:08:25.040]  now what i want to do is open the phones up and i want to discuss this with
[1:08:25.040 --> 1:08:28.240]  everybody in the next segment i'm going to get into this
[1:08:28.240 --> 1:08:31.520]  really important piece because we've seen these
[1:08:31.520 --> 1:08:36.560]  moodies and barons and all the people that rate the stock market
[1:08:36.560 --> 1:08:40.640]  talk about insiders come out and say oh if we open things it'll cause a
[1:08:40.640 --> 1:08:43.440]  depression because we'll never get rid of covid
[1:08:43.440 --> 1:08:47.280]  they chose the common cold that they patented and own
[1:08:47.280 --> 1:08:50.720]  so that it never goes away so everyone suspect
[1:08:50.720 --> 1:08:56.320]  and so they can attribute it to every death that's how the scam works
[1:08:56.320 --> 1:08:59.760]  us risking a second wave and a depression
[1:08:59.760 --> 1:09:03.200]  mark zandy warns we're going to cover this and then go to your calls
[1:09:03.200 --> 1:09:08.400]  start of the next segment i want to give first-time callers a chance to call in

[1:10:16.480 --> 1:10:23.680]  in the next hour and then of course we've got the situation coming out
[1:10:23.680 --> 1:10:29.360]  with general flinn and some of the articles dealing with that
[1:10:29.360 --> 1:10:35.120]  on info wars dot com how now even the doj is slamming nbc's chuck todd over
[1:10:35.120 --> 1:10:41.200]  deceptive editing of ag bar interview yeah how's that feel bar
[1:10:41.200 --> 1:10:45.360]  when the media lies about what you say
[1:10:45.920 --> 1:10:49.200]  and then comes after you
[1:10:50.240 --> 1:10:53.200]  i've had the attorney general in new york who were considering legal action
[1:10:53.200 --> 1:10:56.720]  against right now say that i claim i have a cure to
[1:10:56.720 --> 1:11:00.640]  covid-19 or a treatment i never said any such thing
[1:11:00.640 --> 1:11:04.320]  and then she used the claims that i was committing crimes
[1:11:04.320 --> 1:11:07.280]  to try to get my operations shut down and i'll be talking about it soon but
[1:11:07.280 --> 1:11:12.000]  folks these people are monsters and they've gotten away with all this
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:13.920]  crime and they think they're invincible it's
[1:11:13.920 --> 1:11:20.960]  unbelievable and now they've been caught editing with jump cuts over him
[1:11:20.960 --> 1:11:24.640]  that's what megan kelly did to me i told megan kelly i thought
[1:11:24.640 --> 1:11:28.320]  that sandy hook happened she edited it probably have to sue nbc
[1:11:28.320 --> 1:11:31.600]  that's coming up i mean these people are just crooks man
[1:11:31.600 --> 1:11:37.360]  everybody knows it and i'm so tired of it i'm so sick of it cbs just got caught
[1:11:37.360 --> 1:11:41.040]  staging people going into hospitals and fake lines of cars
[1:11:41.040 --> 1:11:45.120]  as we first reported there's no depth to which these criminals
[1:11:45.120 --> 1:11:50.080]  will not sink and now they're telling us we're locked under martial law forever
[1:11:50.080 --> 1:11:53.680]  ten weeks ago i began to tell listeners they needed to get high-quality
[1:11:53.680 --> 1:11:56.880]  storeable food not because of the virus but because of the
[1:11:56.880 --> 1:12:00.720]  crises and the economic shutdown it would cause because the
[1:12:00.720 --> 1:12:04.480]  globalists were planning to hold america hostage and run a blockade
[1:12:04.480 --> 1:12:08.640]  through the blue cities and blue states now that prediction has come true
[1:12:08.640 --> 1:12:12.160]  because the globalists are running an operation it's not
[1:12:12.160 --> 1:12:16.560]  predictions we have their battle plans so
[1:12:16.560 --> 1:12:19.600]  going back more than eight weeks ago all major storeable food companies were
[1:12:19.600 --> 1:12:22.720]  sold out except my patreon supply because they're the biggest more
[1:12:22.720 --> 1:12:27.040]  preposition when it got to the point they had so many orders coming in
[1:12:27.040 --> 1:12:30.000]  that they wouldn't be able to fulfill them in a timely manner they stopped
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:33.600]  taking orders till they got caught back up well now they're caught back up they
[1:12:33.600 --> 1:12:37.680]  got high-quality storeable food in stock ready to be packaged and shipped to you

[1:13:02.880 --> 1:13:06.800]  isn't enough for us people to get enough profit to operate this operation

[1:14:00.080 --> 1:14:08.640]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[1:14:08.640 --> 1:14:16.160]  you want to stop tyranny well so does he live from the info wars.com studios
[1:14:16.160 --> 1:14:20.960]  it's alex jones
[1:14:20.960 --> 1:14:24.160]  what are we doing today
[1:14:24.720 --> 1:14:28.720]  doing the same thing we do every day pinky taking over the world
[1:14:28.720 --> 1:14:33.280]  that's pinky in the brain there are always people that want to dominate and
[1:14:33.280 --> 1:14:35.280]  take control of everything it's their nature
[1:14:35.280 --> 1:14:40.320]  and globalism is a corporate takeover of the nation state
[1:14:40.320 --> 1:14:47.760]  globalism is total domination for domination's sake
[1:14:47.760 --> 1:14:51.440]  anti god anti family because people that have god and family
[1:14:51.440 --> 1:14:54.640]  are self-sufficient and strong and they're not easily
[1:14:54.640 --> 1:15:00.240]  malleable like clay to the potter
[1:15:00.720 --> 1:15:05.360]  and so we watched going back three months ago four months ago all these
[1:15:05.360 --> 1:15:11.840]  financial experts all these billionaires going on cnbc going on msnbc
[1:15:11.840 --> 1:15:16.240]  going on cnn saying if trump doesn't lock the economy down we're going to
[1:15:16.240 --> 1:15:19.760]  have a total depression we're like really if you lock it down it'll cause
[1:15:19.760 --> 1:15:24.560]  depression then it turned out those individuals
[1:15:24.560 --> 1:15:29.360]  had done giant put options against the stock market and when it plunged they
[1:15:29.360 --> 1:15:34.160]  made millions of dollars one guy made two million dollars in one day
[1:15:34.160 --> 1:15:37.200]  oh but mark the steward went to jail for selling a million dollars or whatever
[1:15:37.200 --> 1:15:40.880]  over stock 800 000 oh but when they do it it's okay
[1:15:40.880 --> 1:15:46.320]  it's good well moody's that tells you what everything's valued
[1:15:46.320 --> 1:15:52.320]  mark zandy has come out and said oh the states are opening too soon
[1:15:52.320 --> 1:15:56.000]  and if that happens why it's going to cause another wave which they're
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:15:59.040]  always planning to say is another wave again
[1:15:59.040 --> 1:16:03.120]  all their numbers were 40 50 times off they adjusted them
[1:16:03.120 --> 1:16:07.120]  and now they zoom way down to the little tiny number and make it huge why
[1:16:07.120 --> 1:16:14.560]  why we've got an emergency five new cases in wuhan everybody run for the hills
[1:16:14.560 --> 1:16:18.800]  my germany's got 50 new cases we're all dead
[1:16:18.800 --> 1:16:25.520]  for seven and a half billion people up to 60 million die a year
[1:16:25.600 --> 1:16:28.720]  millions are dying from tb that can't get treatment and heart attacks and
[1:16:28.720 --> 1:16:33.680]  cancer and suicide but that's okay let's put up the world map here can we have
[1:16:33.680 --> 1:16:38.240]  the supposed dead worldwide not even near a million
[1:16:38.240 --> 1:16:41.680]  and that's with them appropriating every death but i predict
[1:16:41.680 --> 1:16:44.960]  by the end of this year they'll say 20 million worldwide because they
[1:16:44.960 --> 1:16:52.400]  incentivize money by global standardization to the wHO
[1:16:52.400 --> 1:16:55.920]  where everyone's going to say it's a coveted debt to get that money
[1:16:55.920 --> 1:16:59.360]  because we have a global government we have private corporate groups dictating
[1:16:59.360 --> 1:17:05.680]  so let's put it back on screen 283 000 deaths globally
[1:17:05.680 --> 1:17:12.800]  79 000 in the u.s 32 000 the uk 30 000 in Italy 26 000 spain
[1:17:12.800 --> 1:17:17.040]  france brazil brazil was going to be a million dead because
[1:17:17.040 --> 1:17:23.200]  balasaro didn't lock it down now it's 11 207
[1:17:23.280 --> 1:17:27.280]  let's look at sweden they didn't do anything they've got one of the lowest
[1:17:27.280 --> 1:17:31.680]  deaths that's because they're not doing fraudulent testing
[1:17:32.960 --> 1:17:36.720]  it's all a giant scam
[1:17:37.680 --> 1:17:40.160]  and they're going to have the blue cities the blue states first and the big
[1:17:40.160 --> 1:17:43.520]  corporations not let you leave your house not let you have a job unless
[1:17:43.520 --> 1:17:48.000]  you've got that i d card or that digital app on your phone saying you're
[1:17:48.000 --> 1:17:51.840]  kosher and morons that opt into this like they're the
[1:17:51.840 --> 1:17:55.760]  good people they're the heroes they need to be confronted with the fact that
[1:17:55.760 --> 1:17:59.120]  they're schmucks engineering a global financial collapse
[1:17:59.120 --> 1:18:03.760]  and mass death in the third world of tens of millions
[1:18:03.760 --> 1:18:07.520]  who can't get basic medicine and who are starving to death
[1:18:07.520 --> 1:18:11.680]  that's the real world you delicate geniuses

[1:18:50.720 --> 1:18:53.200]  of course there's no deaths now in the u.s from flu because they're all
[1:18:53.200 --> 1:18:57.840]  attributed to covet covet covet covet
[1:18:57.840 --> 1:19:01.280]  now to have that as the new european siren on police car instead of

[1:19:06.720 --> 1:19:09.600]  inner civilization oh a panic over a virus
[1:19:09.600 --> 1:19:12.960]  run by bill mullin the gates psychotics that said they want a global reset
[1:19:12.960 --> 1:19:16.160]  and to shut the economy down and now hollywood's celebrating it saying we
[1:19:16.160 --> 1:19:20.880]  all deserve a star of the death but it's okay here's mark
[1:19:20.880 --> 1:19:26.480]  zandy on cnbc telling you he doesn't want a depression
[1:19:26.480 --> 1:19:30.080]  so just keep the economy shut down it's like saying i don't want you to die
[1:19:30.080 --> 1:19:33.040]  so let me shoot you in the head with a 12-gauge shotgun
[1:19:33.040 --> 1:19:37.680]  that point blank rage you're like that'll kill me no it won't
[1:19:37.680 --> 1:19:42.720]  he's like i love your thumb let me smash it with a hammer
[1:19:42.720 --> 1:19:50.560]  oh but he's a hero here's the you mr hero here's the you mark zandy here he is
[1:19:50.560 --> 1:19:54.240]  the prospect of a depression given the data we have today mark your thoughts
[1:19:54.240 --> 1:19:58.800]  there well i think if
[1:19:58.800 --> 1:20:03.520]  we reopen too quickly and we see infections rise get a second wave
[1:20:03.520 --> 1:20:07.200]  uh in that causes more business disruption we may not shut down again
[1:20:07.200 --> 1:20:09.840]  but certainly it will scare people spook people and
[1:20:09.840 --> 1:20:13.840]  weigh on the economy that would be the fodder for a depression in my
[1:20:13.840 --> 1:20:16.960]  nomenclature depression would be double-digit unemployment for more than
[1:20:16.960 --> 1:20:19.760]  a year we already have that you know if we get
[1:20:19.760 --> 1:20:23.600]  through this period without another wave then this will end up being a really
[1:20:23.600 --> 1:20:26.640]  bad recession but if we get a second wave it'll be a
[1:20:26.640 --> 1:20:30.000]  depression and of course they're going to call it
[1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:33.360]  a second wave and a third and a fourth and a fifth bill gates said last week i
[1:20:33.360 --> 1:20:39.520]  played the clip last hour he said talking to steven cobert the
[1:20:39.520 --> 1:20:43.200]  comic that poses a newsman that now poses as our doctor
[1:20:43.200 --> 1:20:47.840]  he said oh this is just wave one the next wave is a bio attack
[1:20:47.840 --> 1:20:51.840]  as i've told you for years a real bio attack this is just making sure you
[1:20:51.840 --> 1:20:54.800]  behave yourself because they don't want things to get out of hand
[1:20:54.800 --> 1:20:59.520]  when they really take an axe to your ass and so that's what i've been telling
[1:20:59.520 --> 1:21:02.400]  listeners i'm actually now moving to the country
[1:21:02.400 --> 1:21:06.560]  i'm actually building the armored fortress
[1:21:06.560 --> 1:21:09.600]  look like a farmhouse but it's gonna have steel walls
[1:21:09.600 --> 1:21:13.760]  i'm actually giving up on folks i mean spiritually we got to get people right
[1:21:13.760 --> 1:21:17.920]  with god we're gonna try to fix things but we failed to stop the globalist
[1:21:17.920 --> 1:21:21.600]  takeover at this level we knew it'd be a biological weapon attack we first said
[1:21:21.600 --> 1:21:25.680]  it'd be a simulant to lock you down and tell you that since in game
[1:21:25.680 --> 1:21:30.000]  2007 and then the real bio attacks come after this
[1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:34.240]  word for word what i've told you in fact do get that archive as we've got that's
[1:21:34.240 --> 1:21:38.880]  so good at finding things get him to go back for the bill gates film we're
[1:21:38.880 --> 1:21:42.560]  making right now this is his main job and find all the times i said the first
[1:21:42.560 --> 1:21:46.240]  bio attack will only kill maybe a couple hundred thousand worldwide
[1:21:46.240 --> 1:21:49.920]  that'll be the simulant to lock everybody down they will have ids and
[1:21:49.920 --> 1:21:54.240]  tracker chips and and and apps and drones and robots controlling us
[1:21:54.240 --> 1:21:58.080]  and then the next wave will kill a couple hundred million
[1:21:58.080 --> 1:22:01.200]  and we'll really get locked down under that it'll legitimize the lockdown and
[1:22:01.200 --> 1:22:05.040]  you wear your damn mask and you take your inoculation we lost millions
[1:22:05.040 --> 1:22:09.280]  i lost my mom i lost my brother you you do it you'll have the the contact
[1:22:09.280 --> 1:22:14.480]  tracers ready the you know the mallest enforcer brigades
[1:22:14.480 --> 1:22:17.680]  and then after we're all locked down and behaving ourselves
[1:22:17.680 --> 1:22:21.440]  they won't wait long like five years after it's all locked down
[1:22:21.440 --> 1:22:25.840]  and they've purged the anti-vaxxers they're gonna release
[1:22:25.840 --> 1:22:29.760]  a chemical weapon that they're gonna sage biological but they'll have to cure
[1:22:29.760 --> 1:22:33.120]  for themselves and they're just gonna kill i think they'll just go for it all
[1:22:33.120 --> 1:22:37.360]  it'll kill six billion then you're all dead i just remember you won't listen
[1:22:37.360 --> 1:22:40.800]  now but when you're dying flopping around like a
[1:22:40.800 --> 1:22:43.840]  fish vomiting your guts out with blood coming out of your eyes
[1:22:43.840 --> 1:22:48.240]  remember the devil did this to you and that jesus is real
[1:22:48.240 --> 1:22:51.680]  the america that we've known and loved the america that was the land of the free
[1:22:51.680 --> 1:22:56.000]  home of the brave is dying right now and everything our enemies
[1:22:56.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  are doing is about domesticating us shutting us down and making us dependent
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:03.760]  on them the food shortages have begun the depression is
[1:23:03.760 --> 1:23:07.360]  going to be long and very very serious in fact it's probably too late now to
[1:23:07.360 --> 1:23:10.960]  even turn back trump tried to stop it but the mainstream media working with the
[1:23:10.960 --> 1:23:14.560]  tricombs blocked it that's why you and myself everybody else
[1:23:14.560 --> 1:23:19.040]  has to get prepared now do not wait it's not about the virus it's about the
[1:23:19.040 --> 1:23:22.400]  economic chaos that's going to be unleashed in the next six months to a
[1:23:22.400 --> 1:23:24.960]  year get your high quality storeable foods and

[1:23:32.160 --> 1:23:35.520]  this is a globalist siege a globalist lockdown
[1:23:35.520 --> 1:23:40.160]  globalist terrorism but we the people the patriots have to be prepared
[1:23:40.160 --> 1:23:42.880]  we've already been proven right about prepping so far we'll get ready to be
[1:23:42.880 --> 1:23:47.600]  really proven right get your storeable foods now at m4warstore.com
[1:23:47.600 --> 1:23:53.040]  the lockdown is permanent dictatorship the lockdown is designed to have the
[1:23:53.040 --> 1:23:58.240]  public accept their basic rights being suspended and a global
[1:23:58.240 --> 1:24:03.680]  medical tyranny led by the WHO and the middle indigates foundation
[1:24:03.680 --> 1:24:07.520]  in full control many will submit through fear
[1:24:07.520 --> 1:24:12.480]  others will be bought off but in the end the globalists admit they're building a
[1:24:12.480 --> 1:24:16.800]  post-human world and now that we're inside the cage
[1:24:16.800 --> 1:24:21.360]  it's going to move very very quickly into its end game
[1:24:21.360 --> 1:24:24.960]  submission to this is a form of living death
[1:24:24.960 --> 1:24:28.720]  and committing the next generation and our own generation
[1:24:28.720 --> 1:24:33.280]  to a living hell that cannot be imagined until you're actually

[1:28:24.560 --> 1:28:32.320]  because again COVID-19's hyped up and we now understand the takeover plan
[1:28:32.320 --> 1:28:36.800]  they they chose a patented cold virus so they could say everybody was suspect
[1:28:36.800 --> 1:28:40.240]  and so they can always say all deaths are being caused by it it's built in so
[1:28:40.240 --> 1:28:43.520]  they can use the statistics and ramp them up with the normal death rates
[1:28:43.520 --> 1:28:47.040]  or ramp them down not counting the death rates so this is all
[1:28:47.040 --> 1:28:50.640]  absolutely a scam we've cracked the code the president understands it that's in
[1:28:50.640 --> 1:28:53.040]  the news now but we got to go further than just
[1:28:53.040 --> 1:28:56.160]  sidelining the fraudulent fouchy NIH crime syndicate
[1:28:56.160 --> 1:29:00.400]  they've got to be prosecuted ap exclusive doc show that white house
[1:29:00.400 --> 1:29:05.360]  officials buried cdc report no he sidelined him he was thinking
[1:29:05.360 --> 1:29:08.080]  about getting rid of it completely but instead of making him victims he just
[1:29:08.080 --> 1:29:11.200]  sidelined these lying monsters so fouchy to get headlines again goes
[1:29:11.200 --> 1:29:16.240]  i'm self quarantining because eight people in the white house tested positive
[1:29:16.240 --> 1:29:20.080]  for coronavirus which again a papaya or a goat will test
[1:29:20.080 --> 1:29:23.840]  positive this is part of him grabbing headlines again when it comes out that he
[1:29:23.840 --> 1:29:29.200]  jailed a top scientist that exposed him profiting off hiv drugs
[1:29:29.200 --> 1:29:32.080]  but their attempt to silence her has only failed as well
[1:29:32.080 --> 1:29:35.600]  word is she's going to be testifying in congress so the globalists are in a lot
[1:29:35.600 --> 1:29:38.800]  of trouble the problem is they're going to launch even bigger attacks now
[1:29:38.800 --> 1:29:43.760]  what's coming next after the covet hoax depression and then more covet hoax
[1:29:43.760 --> 1:29:48.000]  because it's built in because it's the cold virus

[1:30:54.400 --> 1:30:58.000]  tyranny we're all in grave danger it says you're a medical worker what's
[1:30:58.000 --> 1:31:01.360]  your view on the lockdown i'm i just check in patients at an
[1:31:01.360 --> 1:31:04.000]  mri office
[1:31:04.800 --> 1:31:10.880]  what is your view on all this my view is it's over exaggerated
[1:31:10.880 --> 1:31:13.440]  what do the doctors and other medical workers around you think what's the
[1:31:13.440 --> 1:31:17.040]  consensus they're just taking extreme precautions
[1:31:17.040 --> 1:31:22.080]  i feel like it's half and half some of them are buying into it some aren't
[1:31:22.080 --> 1:31:26.960]  well i appreciate you calling today anything else on your mind
[1:31:26.960 --> 1:31:31.600]  no thank you for taking my call i i appreciate you calling
[1:31:31.600 --> 1:31:34.320]  and again i said i'm not going to say thanks for calling but then i do still
[1:31:34.320 --> 1:31:37.440]  say it it burns up times let's just go to the callers i love you all
[1:31:37.440 --> 1:31:41.600]  angela or no that's angel uh in florida you're on the air go ahead
[1:31:41.600 --> 1:31:45.120]  hey Alex how are you welcome sir says you're an immigrant on the venezuela
[1:31:45.120 --> 1:31:48.640]  situation go ahead yeah man uh i've been hearing you for for
[1:31:48.640 --> 1:31:52.480]  some time and i really admire you and what you're doing
[1:31:52.480 --> 1:31:56.480]  i came to this country i'm an immigrant and i'm from venezuela
[1:31:56.480 --> 1:32:00.720]  and what i'm looking in my country is pretty much a pilot program for global
[1:32:00.720 --> 1:32:04.800]  control and what happened is the chinese took over our
[1:32:04.800 --> 1:32:09.040]  resources over there like the government the corrupt government they sold
[1:32:09.040 --> 1:32:13.520]  like 10 20 years of oil without taking it out
[1:32:13.520 --> 1:32:16.400]  so the the chinese government they give the money
[1:32:16.400 --> 1:32:20.960]  so they own the land and the extraction so the problem is that
[1:32:20.960 --> 1:32:24.560]  the united states very hard for the u.s to get in the in the country and help us
[1:32:24.560 --> 1:32:28.640]  because the chinese are there and they don't allow anyone to come in because
[1:32:28.640 --> 1:32:32.960]  they have investments in the country so what happened is the government is
[1:32:32.960 --> 1:32:37.280]  having the chinese as a shield protection because now they know no one
[1:32:37.280 --> 1:32:39.680]  can touch them and that's pretty much what is
[1:32:39.680 --> 1:32:43.920]  happening in in the country uh there's a lot of starvation
[1:32:43.920 --> 1:32:48.560]  i have my family over there and uh i'm being sending food over there and the
[1:32:48.560 --> 1:32:53.440]  situation there covet 19 for them is nothing against what is going on
[1:32:53.440 --> 1:32:57.120]  the level of starvation and people dying because they don't have uh
[1:32:57.120 --> 1:33:02.240]  access to the hospitals or anything else no no access at all i mean what is
[1:33:02.240 --> 1:33:05.760]  happening over there is amazing it's amazing people are dying every day
[1:33:05.760 --> 1:33:08.800]  thousands of people are dying and by the way what you're saying is accurate i
[1:33:08.800 --> 1:33:12.080]  remember five years ago they were saying two thousand die a week of starvation
[1:33:12.080 --> 1:33:16.240]  i'm hearing those numbers are way up uh the zoo animals were eating many years
[1:33:16.240 --> 1:33:21.840]  ago communist china has praised uh your dictator maduro
[1:33:21.840 --> 1:33:25.280]  he's traveled to beijing and been praised by ji ji ping
[1:33:25.280 --> 1:33:28.560]  and i know you're one of the richest countries resources wise in the in the
[1:33:28.560 --> 1:33:32.400]  world but under communism you've been stripped down to nothing
[1:33:32.400 --> 1:33:35.840]  uh and now they're just praying on you it's so sad
[1:33:35.840 --> 1:33:41.120]  no it's uh what i mean we didn't have the the the need to immigrate to any
[1:33:41.120 --> 1:33:44.480]  country which our country was so rich that we didn't have the need to immigrate
[1:33:44.480 --> 1:33:48.880]  anywhere so we're the biggest uh jasper right now in the whole world
[1:33:48.880 --> 1:33:52.320]  we have more than five million people uh out of the country
[1:33:52.320 --> 1:33:58.000]  so what i'm saying is that there's a big uh global elite behind this with like
[1:33:58.000 --> 1:34:03.280]  the global economic forum and the imf the imf is getting so much
[1:34:03.280 --> 1:34:07.600]  profiting about all this what is happening and and i remember that they
[1:34:07.600 --> 1:34:12.640]  had the ones that give the money or or give the depth to our countries and
[1:34:12.640 --> 1:34:16.480]  and now we're like a slave for them behind everything that is happening in the
[1:34:16.480 --> 1:34:20.320]  u.s the imf and the global economic forum is behind
[1:34:20.320 --> 1:34:24.160]  this it's very hard to get out of this because it's a huge
[1:34:24.160 --> 1:34:27.760]  well that's right and then people like shan pin go and praise yugo shavez and
[1:34:27.760 --> 1:34:31.040]  maduro when they literally live in palaces and
[1:34:31.040 --> 1:34:34.080]  have enslaved the people and destroyed the middle class
[1:34:34.080 --> 1:34:38.000]  and then it's the communists that work with the imf and world bank
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:42.160]  to actually exploit them so it's it's crony capitalist
[1:34:42.160 --> 1:34:46.160]  working with communists to oppress their people it's absolutely sick
[1:34:46.160 --> 1:34:50.000]  hey alex and you know what happened when you go to europe and you ask for uh
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:53.680]  what is going on in venezuela for the whole european mind
[1:34:53.680 --> 1:34:56.960]  everything that is happening in venezuela is correct we have the best
[1:34:56.960 --> 1:35:00.960]  uh health system we have the best uh leadership
[1:35:00.960 --> 1:35:05.200]  but these people are all socials and communists and all that leadership in
[1:35:05.200 --> 1:35:08.640]  europe and asia they praise what what is happening in
[1:35:08.640 --> 1:35:14.000]  venezuela but what happened is that they that we are the model we're a pilot
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:17.120]  model for them because that's exactly how they want to control the whole
[1:35:17.120 --> 1:35:21.200]  population by telling them what to eat and what not to eat and the government
[1:35:21.200 --> 1:35:25.120]  is the one that gives the food so no one has in fact they make people pray to
[1:35:25.120 --> 1:35:28.160]  yugo shavez to get their school lunches god bless you angel
[1:35:28.160 --> 1:35:33.440]  all right powerful call david kasey side jordan brett
[1:35:33.440 --> 1:35:37.120]  bregg tyler your calls are all straight ahead
[1:35:37.120 --> 1:35:39.680]  brett wants to make the point that all the big shops are closed and all the
[1:35:39.680 --> 1:35:43.840]  small ones are locked down how obvious is this it's a total global corporate
[1:35:43.840 --> 1:35:48.800]  takeover we'll be right back it took hundreds and hundreds of years of
[1:35:48.800 --> 1:35:51.920]  human civilization to build up the world economy
[1:35:51.920 --> 1:35:56.080]  to where it is every economist is on record saying that
[1:35:56.080 --> 1:35:59.120]  as this economy has been shut down for two months
[1:35:59.120 --> 1:36:01.520]  it is going to be a death sentence to the third world
[1:36:01.520 --> 1:36:05.200]  and a horrible nightmarish collapse for the first world
[1:36:05.200 --> 1:36:09.200]  and that the general public is going to go into deep deep debt to the mega banks
[1:36:09.200 --> 1:36:13.920]  they're not going to have medical ID cards forced inoculations we are now
[1:36:13.920 --> 1:36:18.560]  in a giant dystopia but a lot of people are waking up
[1:36:18.560 --> 1:36:22.880]  and there is a major backlash taking place against this tyranny
[1:36:22.880 --> 1:36:27.200]  and we must all rediscover our bill of rights rediscover our constitution and
[1:36:27.200 --> 1:36:31.680]  our backbone and start saying no to people who take this moral high ground
[1:36:31.680 --> 1:36:35.360]  and say shut your business down shut your life down it'll save lives
[1:36:35.360 --> 1:36:39.840]  no it's caused millions to already starve to death tens of millions more
[1:36:39.840 --> 1:36:42.960]  so the cowards who went along with us with your virtues signaling you have
[1:36:42.960 --> 1:36:48.000]  destroyed your lives and our lives congratulations

[1:40:06.400 --> 1:40:17.280]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[1:40:17.680 --> 1:40:23.360]  all right david ike has now been unpersoned like i was two years ago
[1:40:23.360 --> 1:40:26.800]  and i've invited him to do a show here on the weekend or whenever he wants
[1:40:26.800 --> 1:40:30.080]  because that's what we want on air is who's been de-platformed by band
[1:40:30.080 --> 1:40:33.040]  on video so incredible we've got the press conferences that medical
[1:40:33.040 --> 1:40:38.000]  doctors have exposing covet 19 as a hoax we've got the videos from
[1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:41.600]  cedar sinai that have been banned up there we've got the
[1:40:41.600 --> 1:40:45.760]  documentary that's been banned off dozens of platforms
[1:40:45.760 --> 1:40:49.600]  doctors in black up at band on video that's what we're doing in fact we should
[1:40:49.600 --> 1:40:53.440]  create a section that's banned films because
[1:40:53.440 --> 1:40:56.080]  all the films that are kind of scattered around we should put them all
[1:40:56.080 --> 1:41:01.200]  in one place there's so much on the site every day and the site's free
[1:41:01.200 --> 1:41:04.480]  that's why you buy the products finances all of this and our bandwidth
[1:41:04.480 --> 1:41:08.800]  costs are just off the charts right now because
[1:41:08.800 --> 1:41:12.720]  as censorship explodes people are driven to info wars now
[1:41:12.720 --> 1:41:15.760]  which is not what i wanted to happen but i knew it would happen
[1:41:15.760 --> 1:41:18.880]  two years ago people said how are you handling this i said we're going to get
[1:41:18.880 --> 1:41:21.600]  in place and have our own independent system of folks support us
[1:41:21.600 --> 1:41:24.480]  because when it gets really bad they make their big power move
[1:41:24.480 --> 1:41:27.600]  probably with a controlled bioweapon release to bring in world government
[1:41:27.600 --> 1:41:30.400]  world id we've got to stay on air to fight it
[1:41:30.400 --> 1:41:35.920]  and now here we are inside the dystopia it's not theoretical now world
[1:41:35.920 --> 1:41:40.000]  government forced inoculation forced microchipping being announced
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:45.120]  in israel in sweden it's all going down
[1:41:45.120 --> 1:41:50.320]  cy in florida than tyler than brett cy thanks for holding her on the air
[1:41:50.320 --> 1:41:54.000]  hey alex thanks for having me on well listen i just wanted to
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:57.200]  basically go over the falsifying of the numbers by the cdc and then obviously
[1:41:57.200 --> 1:42:00.320]  the world health organization and then you've got all of america and house
[1:42:00.320 --> 1:42:04.080]  arrest it's not even a quarantine you know quarantine is for sick people i
[1:42:04.080 --> 1:42:06.960]  wish people would get that through their head exactly you usually quarantine
[1:42:06.960 --> 1:42:10.400]  who's sick and confirmed instead we're all locked down
[1:42:10.400 --> 1:42:14.160]  this has never been done before that's right and then also you've got i mean
[1:42:14.160 --> 1:42:17.040]  this is all the part of the lockstep like you said you always preach it you know
[1:42:17.040 --> 1:42:20.320]  all about the rockfeller foundation and then you've got the bill de berg meetings
[1:42:20.320 --> 1:42:23.520]  listen this is also the same people that are pushing for lockdown are the same
[1:42:23.520 --> 1:42:28.080]  ones pushing for everybody on a fixed income you got socialism mass inoculation
[1:42:28.080 --> 1:42:31.680]  of the people the open borders mass abortions child sacrifice i mean the
[1:42:31.680 --> 1:42:34.400]  pet of it the list goes on now if you already know
[1:42:34.400 --> 1:42:38.160]  but you know it's so funny before this whole thing happened you had the trump
[1:42:38.160 --> 1:42:41.360]  rally's packed out and now you now you've got people
[1:42:41.360 --> 1:42:44.720]  you know buying for everything they'll just shoot it over to zoom and have
[1:42:44.720 --> 1:42:48.880]  everybody speak online i just think it's very funny
[1:42:48.880 --> 1:42:54.560]  it's a whole agenda switching the train from one train to the other teaching you
[1:42:54.560 --> 1:42:58.720]  don't go out and get a job you don't go out and start a business you work for us
[1:42:58.720 --> 1:43:02.480]  but you're obsolete people need to understand this is an admitted trap
[1:43:02.480 --> 1:43:07.920]  and the democrats and the hollywood scum have jumped the gun they're
[1:43:07.920 --> 1:43:12.080]  admitting oh this is good for the earth it's good that the old economy is going
[1:43:12.080 --> 1:43:14.720]  away well how obvious is that my friend
[1:43:14.720 --> 1:43:18.960]  how do you think it's going for them sigh yeah and now you can see everybody's
[1:43:18.960 --> 1:43:20.960]  two colors each state a little bit different you know
[1:43:20.960 --> 1:43:24.320]  they put in a certain governor and now you see who side their own but it's
[1:43:24.320 --> 1:43:26.800]  really actually in a lot of this is about a lot of good things to
[1:43:26.800 --> 1:43:30.320]  like but you've got you know people like even the FBI and the CIA they're all
[1:43:30.320 --> 1:43:33.520]  militarized you know operations so i mean
[1:43:33.520 --> 1:43:36.640]  just to see it's really it's really not even about a republican and the
[1:43:36.640 --> 1:43:39.520]  democrat anymore it's a fight between light and darkness
[1:43:39.520 --> 1:43:42.560]  well that's right and everybody in the agencies and the corporations have to

[1:44:34.240 --> 1:44:37.120]  because they weren't having the income rate because the hospitals are
[1:44:37.120 --> 1:44:39.920]  slow and empty

[1:44:47.840 --> 1:44:51.360]  fake hazmat gear crews and it turns out those very hospitals were

[1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:05.280]  so i mean it's not a surprise but it still is a surprise because
[1:47:05.280 --> 1:47:09.120]  i can't believe they're really that evil brother oh they are that evil think
[1:47:09.120 --> 1:47:12.240]  about it so i guess two things i want to get across

[1:47:15.520 --> 1:47:18.640]  walmart there's no social distancing at all going on there
[1:47:18.640 --> 1:47:21.680]  they're letting people in by the herd you know what i'm saying
[1:47:21.680 --> 1:47:24.640]  it's insane you know and then you got the local

[1:47:44.480 --> 1:47:49.760]  you can fly from wuhan to london and all it's in the news that the british

[1:50:07.520 --> 1:50:13.120]  ahead of david ike and again if you're a tv viewer i'm wearing

[1:50:24.880 --> 1:50:28.400]  and bill gates can't argue with either bill gates you're a eugenicist you're a
[1:50:28.400 --> 1:50:31.840]  criminal you can't argue i'm not threatening wearing a pink shirt
[1:50:31.840 --> 1:50:36.880]  you see only one thing trumps gates that's a pink shirt
[1:50:36.880 --> 1:50:40.640]  feudalism in the ancient world from asia to europe from africa to
[1:50:40.640 --> 1:50:45.360]  latin america was the most common form of government you had a ruling class
[1:50:45.360 --> 1:50:48.480]  the nobility the king and queen sitting on top of it
[1:50:48.480 --> 1:50:53.120]  and the rest of the public were kept to this assistance starving level
[1:50:53.120 --> 1:50:58.000]  for control in fact in most cultures they call the peasants the little people
[1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:02.720]  because they were usually a foot or more shorter than the lords and ladies
[1:51:02.720 --> 1:51:07.360]  because they kept them again at a starving level they were so busy trying
[1:51:07.360 --> 1:51:10.160]  to survive they would never try to challenge the
[1:51:10.160 --> 1:51:13.200]  entrenched elite well now all the big google owners and the
[1:51:13.200 --> 1:51:17.280]  rockefellers and the roth child the jeff bezos is the world they're sitting
[1:51:17.280 --> 1:51:22.000]  back on their giant estates with their jet helicopters and private jets
[1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:25.600]  living the life laughing at you shut down
[1:51:25.600 --> 1:51:29.920]  going bankrupt in the third world starving to death their religion is power
[1:51:29.920 --> 1:51:34.240]  and control and they are pressing that advantage against us we
[1:51:34.240 --> 1:51:37.680]  must break free from these monsters
[1:51:37.680 --> 1:51:42.880]  info wars has become a symbol an emblem of not just american freedom
[1:51:42.880 --> 1:51:48.000]  but worldwide maverick spirit it's not just myself or the host of info wars
[1:51:48.000 --> 1:51:51.840]  or the researchers or the journalists it's you the listeners
[1:51:51.840 --> 1:51:56.080]  the activists the people on the front lines in the arena and it's the amazing
[1:51:56.080 --> 1:52:00.480]  guests and individuals that we interviewed that make info wars so
[1:52:00.480 --> 1:52:04.080]  special because we're not putting a filter in front of free minds
[1:52:04.080 --> 1:52:07.760]  we're having an open discussion about the real state of the world
[1:52:07.760 --> 1:52:11.120]  not the establishment and talking points that are put out by the council in
[1:52:11.120 --> 1:52:13.040]  front of relations the builder burden group
[1:52:13.040 --> 1:52:18.320]  davos group and other globalists we're pushing for a pro human future where we
[1:52:18.320 --> 1:52:23.760]  build a planet and beyond based on humans poor humans by humans not a
[1:52:23.760 --> 1:52:26.800]  world where the establishment hate themselves
[1:52:26.800 --> 1:52:30.800]  project their hate onto us and decide we're gonna have a post human world
[1:52:30.800 --> 1:52:34.320]  i'm really excited to know that info wars has your support and i want to thank
[1:52:34.320 --> 1:52:38.800]  you all for being pro human and pro god

[1:55:52.080 --> 1:55:55.680]  yes and then if they have so many that depend on size the hospital they get
[1:55:55.680 --> 1:55:58.160]  millions of dollars hundreds of thousands to millions
[1:55:58.160 --> 1:56:01.120]  depending if they shut their hospital down and just make it about covid
[1:56:01.120 --> 1:56:04.240]  that's why they're all empty because there's not that many covid patients so
[1:56:04.240 --> 1:56:07.360]  then they incentivize to say everyone coming in has covid
[1:56:07.360 --> 1:56:10.240]  which the main test they've done in about 90 percent of the cases
[1:56:10.240 --> 1:56:13.360]  just test for genetic material that almost everyone has in it that's what
[1:56:13.360 --> 1:56:16.800]  the tanzanine president who's a famed biologist in his own
[1:56:16.800 --> 1:56:19.280]  right had a feeling they were buying off the national
[1:56:19.280 --> 1:56:22.640]  lab so he ordered them to test a goat and a papaya
[1:56:22.640 --> 1:56:25.600]  and the chinese made tests said both the goat and the papaya
[1:56:25.600 --> 1:56:31.200]  were dying of covid 19 well my question is where is that money coming
[1:56:31.200 --> 1:56:34.400]  from who's coughing up that money oh we know us
[1:56:34.400 --> 1:56:38.800]  taxpayers pay about 40 of the WHO the chai comms fund about another 30 percent
[1:56:38.800 --> 1:56:42.480]  but doesn't that make the hospitals complicit in the cover-up
[1:56:42.480 --> 1:56:46.720]  sir it is a massive criminal conspiracy and i gotta say red states are corrupt
[1:56:46.720 --> 1:56:49.600]  another compared to blue you notice almost all the deaths are like in
[1:56:49.600 --> 1:56:52.480]  new york but that's because new york is just so
[1:56:52.480 --> 1:56:56.000]  corrupt it'll make your head spin no one denies that it is a cesspit of evil
[1:56:56.000 --> 1:56:58.560]  a lot of good folks live there but the people in charge are evil
[1:56:58.560 --> 1:57:02.560]  they are listing everyone that dies as covid and project veritas
[1:57:02.560 --> 1:57:06.800]  has funeral homeowners and others confirming it and nurses
[1:57:06.800 --> 1:57:10.640]  and cbs just got caught staging people coming in
[1:57:10.640 --> 1:57:13.920]  and staging vehicles we reported that two
[1:57:13.920 --> 1:57:17.040]  months ago and i got a threatening phone call
[1:57:17.040 --> 1:57:21.200]  from some folks saying we're gonna sue you you claim our hospitals doing that
[1:57:21.200 --> 1:57:25.680]  turns out it was fake at that hospital so it's just because people be out front
[1:57:25.680 --> 1:57:29.440]  they notice no one be there for days all sudden 20 people in hazmat suits
[1:57:29.440 --> 1:57:33.440]  and a line of cars for the media and the same people were going in and out in
[1:57:33.440 --> 1:57:38.880]  circles david ike who is now reached that epic level
[1:57:38.880 --> 1:57:41.520]  with only few have been totally banned on the internet
[1:57:41.520 --> 1:57:46.320]  joins us straight ahead stay with us in 60 seconds
[1:57:46.320 --> 1:57:51.040]  make a friend with death it's the same so old that no one knows who first
[1:57:51.040 --> 1:57:54.880]  said it every culture has their own way of
[1:57:54.880 --> 1:58:00.000]  memorializing that simple statement but you don't want to make a friend of the
[1:58:00.000 --> 1:58:03.680]  death of civilization and the death of the human species
[1:58:03.680 --> 1:58:08.640]  the moment of truth is now here we are facing the post human era
[1:58:08.640 --> 1:58:13.040]  and i've been warning you for many years they would use a global viral crisis
[1:58:13.040 --> 1:58:16.720]  to click put us in the cage and then roll out the robot
[1:58:16.720 --> 1:58:22.640]  takeover this is just the beta test china is moving out of beta
[1:58:22.640 --> 1:58:26.400]  and into operational control in just a few years
[1:58:26.400 --> 1:58:31.840]  we will be under full globalist control force inoculations total surveillance
[1:58:31.840 --> 1:58:36.240]  we're all being taught that we are obsolete the term they use is
[1:58:36.240 --> 1:58:40.160]  non essential this is not some dystopian novel
[1:58:40.160 --> 1:58:43.760]  this is reality this is the new world order
[1:58:43.760 --> 1:58:54.720]  this is satanism
[1:59:08.480 --> 1:59:12.400]  let's hear from boris johnson last night that's the first thing that david
[1:59:12.400 --> 1:59:17.680]  ike wants to get into announcing a national tracking code system for
[1:59:17.680 --> 1:59:20.720]  covid-19 other diseases into the future and when
[1:59:20.720 --> 1:59:24.320]  you're allowed to leave your home and a national poll says 90 percent of
[1:59:24.320 --> 1:59:28.640]  written don't ever want to leave their houses again here it is
[1:59:28.640 --> 1:59:32.160]  it is now almost two months since the people of this country
[1:59:32.160 --> 1:59:35.520]  began to put up with restrictions on their freedom
[1:59:35.520 --> 1:59:39.440]  your freedom of a kind that we have never seen before
[1:59:39.440 --> 1:59:44.640]  in peace or war and you have shown the good sense to support those rules
[1:59:44.640 --> 1:59:47.760]  overwhelmingly you've put up with all the hardships
[1:59:47.760 --> 1:59:51.760]  of that program of social distancing because you understand
[1:59:51.760 --> 1:59:56.000]  that as things stand and as the experience of every other country has
[1:59:56.000 --> 2:00:00.080]  shown it's the only way to defeat the coronavirus
[2:00:00.080 --> 2:00:03.840]  the most vicious threat this country has faced in my lifetime
[2:00:03.840 --> 2:00:08.000]  and though the death toll has been tragic and the suffering
[2:00:08.000 --> 2:00:11.760]  immense and though we grieve for all those
[2:00:11.760 --> 2:00:15.920]  we have lost it is a fact that by adopting those
[2:00:15.920 --> 2:00:18.800]  measures we prevented this country from being engulfed
[2:00:18.800 --> 2:00:22.880]  by what so they took everybody's rights away
[2:00:22.880 --> 2:00:26.000]  and kept us all from being engulfed by mass death so
[2:00:26.000 --> 2:00:29.360]  doesn't matter the projections were 50 times 30 times 20 times off
[2:00:29.360 --> 2:00:32.160]  doesn't matter it was all fraud they're counting all the regular deaths
[2:00:32.160 --> 2:00:36.720]  has come at 19 oh no no them taking all your rights is the reason they weren't
[2:00:36.720 --> 2:00:40.240]  completely engulfed but now it's a permanent emergency
[2:00:40.240 --> 2:00:43.520]  and there's this the big tech companies already have the apps
[2:00:43.520 --> 2:00:46.480]  that are going to track you in real time and right where david
[2:00:46.480 --> 2:00:50.480]  ike lives in the uk is where they first are pilot testing it so david
[2:00:50.480 --> 2:00:53.600]  you've been a very busy man after being banned off facebook
[2:00:53.600 --> 2:00:58.320]  being banned off of youtube for refusing to stay silent but you were saying this
[2:00:58.320 --> 2:01:01.280]  months ago you've been vindicated by all the doctors and
[2:01:01.280 --> 2:01:05.680]  scientists and epidemiologists and coroners coming out and saying
[2:01:05.680 --> 2:01:09.760]  you're absolutely right no one's dying of covet they just are infected with
[2:01:09.760 --> 2:01:13.600]  something like covet a corona virus and so they're attributing basically anybody
[2:01:13.600 --> 2:01:17.920]  that's ever had a cold to corona virus when they die
[2:01:17.920 --> 2:01:22.320]  yeah i mean that um statement last night from
[2:01:22.320 --> 2:01:27.120]  borris johnson unfortunately i i missed the last part because i was throwing up
[2:01:27.120 --> 2:01:32.080]  at the time i mean talk about a live fest it was
[2:01:32.080 --> 2:01:38.000]  absolutely sickening and cynical beyond belief
[2:01:38.000 --> 2:01:42.880]  he's locked down britain as other countries like america have been locked
[2:01:42.880 --> 2:01:47.920]  down on the basis of totally fraudulent uh computer
[2:01:47.920 --> 2:01:52.320]  models by a guy called neil ferguson at imperial
[2:01:52.320 --> 2:01:55.440]  college in london and no one's going to tell me
[2:01:55.440 --> 2:02:00.640]  alex that given that his pay master
[2:02:00.640 --> 2:02:06.480]  bill gates wanted lockdowns as part of this whole strategy of vaccination and
[2:02:06.480 --> 2:02:10.800]  destroying people's livelihoods and making them dependent on the
[2:02:10.800 --> 2:02:18.880]  state there's no way that he produced the
[2:02:18.880 --> 2:02:23.520]  catastrophic if they were true projections which
[2:02:23.520 --> 2:02:27.440]  caused lockdown half a million people will die in britain if there's no
[2:02:27.440 --> 2:02:32.000]  lockdown two million in america there's no way he did that
[2:02:32.000 --> 2:02:37.600]  by chance or by accident he was producing what was necessary
[2:02:37.600 --> 2:02:41.840]  to make that happen and what is sickening after all these weeks of
[2:02:41.840 --> 2:02:47.680]  lockdown and destroyed lives um is that last night and still
[2:02:47.680 --> 2:02:51.360]  today in the houses of parliament johnson was still
[2:02:51.360 --> 2:02:55.920]  saying that without the lockdown up to half a million people in britain could
[2:02:55.920 --> 2:03:00.320]  have died it's absolutely sickening and that guy
[2:03:00.320 --> 2:03:06.800]  has to go because he's overseen the destruction of this country and goodness
[2:03:06.800 --> 2:03:11.760]  knows how vast numbers of people are are going to recover from this
[2:03:11.760 --> 2:03:15.840]  because he's he's doing what i've been saying he would
[2:03:15.840 --> 2:03:21.120]  do for weeks and that is roll it back a little bit because the pressure is
[2:03:21.120 --> 2:03:26.960]  starting to push the other way but as little as he can get away with and
[2:03:26.960 --> 2:03:31.440]  that's what's happening and this um slight easing
[2:03:31.440 --> 2:03:35.680]  that he's announced has the rider which he keeps emphasizing
[2:03:35.680 --> 2:03:39.680]  that if the numbers go up again and of course they're fixing the bloody figures
[2:03:39.680 --> 2:03:43.200]  so they can make him go up as much as they like and down when they like
[2:03:43.200 --> 2:03:48.880]  um if it goes up again then he'll have to go back into the lockdown as it was
[2:03:48.880 --> 2:03:53.520]  before so how can businesses even as they're trying to recover from this
[2:03:53.520 --> 2:03:58.720]  catastrophe make any plans and commit any money any
[2:03:58.720 --> 2:04:02.240]  investment when they don't know if they're going to put the
[2:04:02.240 --> 2:04:05.680]  tele on tomorrow and see it's it's gone back to lockdown and
[2:04:05.680 --> 2:04:09.280]  david i want to go over that but but you said it three months ago i said it
[2:04:09.280 --> 2:04:11.760]  three months ago i'm not bragging but you and i were the ones that were dead on
[2:04:11.760 --> 2:04:15.680]  about this this is clearly the post human takeover hollywood
[2:04:15.680 --> 2:04:20.000]  now admits that we want to save the earth that the whole green agenda
[2:04:20.000 --> 2:04:23.840]  they're now admitting that this is a way to devastate the average public
[2:04:23.840 --> 2:04:27.200]  get us dependent get us on the dole so they can dictate
[2:04:27.200 --> 2:04:31.680]  the forced inoculations the dna vaccine that goes into ourselves
[2:04:31.680 --> 2:04:33.920]  we're going to go to break in a few minutes we'll go over all the great
[2:04:33.920 --> 2:04:38.960]  points you want to break down but 35 000 foot view we've now been proven dead
[2:04:38.960 --> 2:04:43.680]  on so what's coming next what's the bigger agenda
[2:04:43.680 --> 2:04:50.800]  well the idea is to roll it back but as little as they can get away with
[2:04:50.800 --> 2:04:54.240]  and having set the precedent of the lockdown
[2:04:54.240 --> 2:04:58.000]  when the second wave comes which because they're fixing the figures they can
[2:04:58.000 --> 2:05:02.320]  make happen when they like or appear to then they'll go straight back into
[2:05:02.320 --> 2:05:06.080]  lockdown and the big thing is the other you
[2:05:06.080 --> 2:05:12.080]  you covered it on on your show as well the big thing that they want in
[2:05:12.080 --> 2:05:16.640]  this next phase is control of food control of
[2:05:16.640 --> 2:05:20.000]  people's incomes well they've got that the vast numbers of people
[2:05:20.000 --> 2:05:25.440]  but control of food as well controlling all the necessities of life
[2:05:25.440 --> 2:05:30.080]  which if you want them we'll dangle you a bit
[2:05:30.080 --> 2:05:33.680]  but you have to do exactly what we say and this is what it's
[2:05:33.680 --> 2:05:40.800]  it's it's all about and johnson is just fronting up for the dark suits
[2:05:40.800 --> 2:05:45.520]  because democracy in britain as in other countries around the world has been
[2:05:45.520 --> 2:05:48.960]  suspended the dark suits they've never seen a ballot
[2:05:48.960 --> 2:05:51.600]  box in their life they're the ones who are driving it
[2:05:51.600 --> 2:05:55.040]  the medical technocrats the science technocrats
[2:05:55.040 --> 2:06:02.960]  and they are advancing agenda in in cohorts with them with bill gates who
[2:06:02.960 --> 2:06:07.440]  owns most of them financially and by the way it's so obvious now bill gates has
[2:06:07.440 --> 2:06:11.760]  been destroyed online every tweet every article that attempts to prop him up is
[2:06:11.760 --> 2:06:15.680]  just flamed with the truth so there does seem to be
[2:06:15.680 --> 2:06:19.360]  the inverse here way beyond a silver lining here that there's a
[2:06:19.360 --> 2:06:24.000]  humongous awakening well that's that's why i've been
[2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:28.080]  every time i've had an opportunity i've been focusing it on gates
[2:06:28.080 --> 2:06:32.880]  because gates is is the key if you can discredit gates and my god how easy is
[2:06:32.880 --> 2:06:35.760]  that then you you can discredit the vaccination
[2:06:35.760 --> 2:06:40.320]  which gates is pushing and you know you've mentioned i've just been
[2:06:40.320 --> 2:06:43.600]  deleted from facebook and deleted from youtube
[2:06:43.600 --> 2:06:47.520]  and and this is how it's working real simple
[2:06:47.520 --> 2:06:50.800]  gates controls the world health organization
[2:06:50.800 --> 2:06:55.360]  ted ross the director general is a former gates employee
[2:06:55.360 --> 2:06:59.920]  ted ross was on the board of gavi the vaccine alliance funded into existence
[2:06:59.920 --> 2:07:04.400]  by a gates that's very much involved in all this so what they do is they say
[2:07:04.400 --> 2:07:07.600]  okay the world health organization created by the rocker
[2:07:07.600 --> 2:07:13.920]  fellas originally of course is the the center of knowledge
[2:07:13.920 --> 2:07:20.800]  and the center of all statements and truth about this
[2:07:20.800 --> 2:07:25.680]  alleged virus and is alleged and then what happens on the other side of the
[2:07:25.680 --> 2:07:29.600]  world or on the other side of america in
[2:07:29.600 --> 2:07:34.960]  silicon valley is these um internet giants controlled
[2:07:34.960 --> 2:07:38.720]  by the same people that can and the forces that control the world health
[2:07:38.720 --> 2:07:45.120]  organization people like um uh susan wajiski at youtube
[2:07:45.120 --> 2:07:49.040]  and zuckerberg at facebook they then say we're going to
[2:07:49.040 --> 2:07:54.640]  censor anyone who is challenging questioning or exposing
[2:07:54.640 --> 2:07:58.640]  including prestigious medical doctors major hospital heads
[2:07:58.640 --> 2:08:04.400]  and what's crazy is now zuckerberg works directly under gates and admits he
[2:08:04.400 --> 2:08:07.920]  takes orders from him and wears the same pink sweater that's why i wore this
[2:08:07.920 --> 2:08:10.560]  pink sweater today did you wear your pink sweater in the
[2:08:10.560 --> 2:08:15.280]  last london reel as an ode to bill gates a little non-threatening pink sweater
[2:08:15.280 --> 2:08:22.560]  well i i know but um this connection between silicon valley and the world
[2:08:22.560 --> 2:08:27.600]  health organization it can never be more blatant to actually come out as
[2:08:27.600 --> 2:08:31.200]  wajiski has at youtube and say we are going to
[2:08:31.200 --> 2:08:35.600]  censor um that which challenges the world health organization what what it
[2:08:35.600 --> 2:08:38.560]  means is the united nations is in control of what
[2:08:38.560 --> 2:08:40.800]  we can say already we're already under you in control
[2:08:40.800 --> 2:08:44.160]  david ike stay right there in fact queue up that clip of wajowski folks i don't
[2:08:44.160 --> 2:08:48.400]  have to tell you that we are in the most important point in human history
[2:08:48.400 --> 2:08:51.680]  the globalists have taken the gloves off and they've taken the mask off and
[2:08:51.680 --> 2:08:54.640]  they're like yeah you're taking implantable chips
[2:08:54.640 --> 2:08:58.240]  yeah we're into pedophilia yeah we're into world government
[2:08:58.240 --> 2:09:02.080]  yeah you're obsolete you are non-essential
[2:09:02.080 --> 2:09:06.240]  we are shutting your ass down yeah we told you don't be farmers
[2:09:06.240 --> 2:09:09.280]  and don't be ranchers and don't work in industry anymore you're going to be the
[2:09:09.280 --> 2:09:12.560]  service economy and now all the globalists are telling you
[2:09:12.560 --> 2:09:15.760]  that there's no more service economy and you're obsolete
[2:09:15.760 --> 2:09:18.560]  so you better bow down to them and get your universal
[2:09:18.560 --> 2:09:21.520]  pittance income so they can dictate your life

[2:11:04.080 --> 2:11:09.280]  luchitsky whose sister heads up 23 and me the dna testing company that's been
[2:11:09.280 --> 2:11:12.960]  caught taking and using your dna
[2:11:12.960 --> 2:11:16.720]  also is on the board of black so smith climb
[2:11:16.720 --> 2:11:20.080]  and so it's sort of happening about 10 years ago is big tech began to merge
[2:11:20.080 --> 2:11:23.520]  with big pharma and now they don't let you do consumer reviews they don't let
[2:11:23.520 --> 2:11:26.160]  people challenge it mothers are talking about their kids getting
[2:11:26.160 --> 2:11:29.520]  damaged by vaccines they're just deleted off facebook
[2:11:29.520 --> 2:11:32.800]  off twitter off youtube it is a total
[2:11:32.800 --> 2:11:36.560]  takeover and there's the article you can see the full video there youtube
[2:11:36.560 --> 2:11:41.040]  ceo anything that goes against the wh o is a violation of youtube's
[2:11:41.040 --> 2:11:45.360]  policies that is the quote so literally david ike of david ike dot com
[2:11:45.360 --> 2:11:52.560]  and ike conic dot com now we're being told we wake up one day and the wh o
[2:11:52.560 --> 2:11:56.240]  san antonio just passed the law that if you say chinese virus you're arrested
[2:11:56.240 --> 2:12:01.840]  and they said because the wh o says it's not chinese so now we've learned the
[2:12:01.840 --> 2:12:07.200]  wh o run by billum lindigates is king of earth david ike
[2:12:07.200 --> 2:12:11.200]  well that's what it was created to do
[2:12:11.200 --> 2:12:16.240]  was the idea is to have everything globally centrally controlled
[2:12:16.240 --> 2:12:20.080]  and so what they want under their world government
[2:12:20.080 --> 2:12:25.200]  is all the major subject areas of human life
[2:12:25.200 --> 2:12:29.120]  controlled under one roof that's why we have the world trade organization
[2:12:29.120 --> 2:12:33.120]  that's why we have the world health organization what's happening now is
[2:12:33.120 --> 2:12:35.680]  what it was originally created to do and they've gone
[2:12:35.680 --> 2:12:40.080]  stepping stones what i call the totalitarian tiptoe to where it's
[2:12:40.080 --> 2:12:45.760]  become the the arbiter of health policy and health
[2:12:45.760 --> 2:12:51.600]  truth the world over and if you can first of all
[2:12:51.600 --> 2:12:59.520]  dominate the the narrative and then censor all challenges to that narrative
[2:12:59.520 --> 2:13:03.680]  then basically all most people here are what you want them to hear and
[2:13:03.680 --> 2:13:08.320]  want them to believe and you know we we um
[2:13:08.320 --> 2:13:12.560]  we have to not let these people like susan wachiski
[2:13:12.560 --> 2:13:16.160]  and zuckerberg get away with what they're doing
[2:13:16.160 --> 2:13:21.280]  because what they are it's not beat about the bush they are facilitators of
[2:13:21.280 --> 2:13:29.360]  fascism if you look at any situation in history
[2:13:29.360 --> 2:13:36.720]  are equivalent to medical doctors being deleted
[2:13:36.720 --> 2:13:41.120]  because not what they're saying is wrong but because
[2:13:41.120 --> 2:13:45.840]  it's not in sync with the official narrative through the
[2:13:45.840 --> 2:13:50.560]  world health organization the only time you see that happen
[2:13:50.560 --> 2:13:55.200]  is in fascist and communist regimes they're basically the same anyway
[2:13:55.200 --> 2:14:00.560]  that's the only time you see it so what susan wachiski
[2:14:00.560 --> 2:14:04.800]  and zuckerberg are doing is they're facilitating
[2:14:04.800 --> 2:14:11.840]  and advancing and making possible fascism and what does that make them
[2:14:11.840 --> 2:14:16.800]  gates is absolutely fascistic in what he's doing
[2:14:16.800 --> 2:14:22.160]  who is this guy he's a bloke that's come through selling software
[2:14:22.160 --> 2:14:26.720]  and now suddenly he's dictating global health policy
[2:14:26.720 --> 2:14:31.120]  it's ridiculous it's it's crazy it's alice in wonderland
[2:14:31.120 --> 2:14:37.680]  these people are creating a fascist global state and they need to be called
[2:14:37.680 --> 2:14:42.720]  out on that not you know beating about the bush and
[2:14:42.720 --> 2:14:47.520]  you know watching your language they are fascists in what they're doing and
[2:14:47.520 --> 2:14:52.400]  they need to be called out on it and eventually
[2:14:52.400 --> 2:14:55.920]  brought to book about it because they have
[2:14:55.920 --> 2:15:02.240]  in the last two months or so together a handful of people destroyed
[2:15:02.240 --> 2:15:08.080]  the livelihoods and the lives of vast numbers of people worldwide
[2:15:08.080 --> 2:15:11.600]  and and they all have to go to jail
[2:15:11.600 --> 2:15:18.080]  for crimes against humanity when we get back power from this
[2:15:18.080 --> 2:15:23.920]  fascistic network and we will eventually if people stiffen their backbone
[2:15:23.920 --> 2:15:28.000]  and start sitting there hoping that something will come up
[2:15:28.000 --> 2:15:31.920]  it's not going to come up unless you make it come up
[2:15:31.920 --> 2:15:35.520]  because this is not where it's meant to end this is
[2:15:35.520 --> 2:15:40.080]  just the stepping stone towards something far more extreme
[2:15:40.080 --> 2:15:44.960]  if we sit here and do nothing now
[2:15:45.200 --> 2:15:49.200]  extremely powerful and looking into wuchitski's sister
[2:15:49.200 --> 2:15:52.960]  with 23andMe that's on record being caught taking people's DNA tests for
[2:15:52.960 --> 2:15:56.000]  secret operations selling them doing weird things
[2:15:56.000 --> 2:15:59.920]  she got 300 million dollars from laxosmithcline and
[2:15:59.920 --> 2:16:04.320]  when you look into google facebook all of them they are literally merging with
[2:16:04.320 --> 2:16:07.360]  big pharma and now all these studies all this
[2:16:07.360 --> 2:16:10.960]  research showing vaccine damage even videos of the world health organization
[2:16:10.960 --> 2:16:14.400]  chief scientist last year saying vaccines are hurting people
[2:16:14.400 --> 2:16:18.160]  and that the cover-up needs to end they will delete that off youtube so they've
[2:16:18.160 --> 2:16:21.120]  gone full fascist we hear about
[2:16:21.120 --> 2:16:23.280]  chinese doctors getting in trouble for talking about
[2:16:23.280 --> 2:16:27.760]  covid-19 and and getting arrested that's big news here but
[2:16:27.760 --> 2:16:31.280]  they're already doing that here they're already shutting everybody down
[2:16:31.280 --> 2:16:35.280]  there's this there's this emergence this this leap into evil you talked
[2:16:35.280 --> 2:16:38.720]  about it 30 years ago then when you first went public you said
[2:16:38.720 --> 2:16:42.400]  this will build underneath the water for a while but when it
[2:16:42.400 --> 2:16:46.240]  finally explodes out there's a point where it must emerge and is this not
[2:16:46.240 --> 2:16:49.040]  the great emergence of the new world order
[2:16:49.040 --> 2:16:52.560]  well it is it's walked into the room but the doors
[2:16:52.560 --> 2:16:56.400]  click behind it it's come out of the shadows at least we can see it now and
[2:16:56.400 --> 2:17:00.160]  vast numbers of people who couldn't see it before have
[2:17:00.160 --> 2:17:04.880]  no choice but to acknowledge the world is not like they thought it was
[2:17:04.880 --> 2:17:09.120]  and the forces in control are not what they thought those forces were
[2:17:09.120 --> 2:17:15.760]  but the thing about black so smith kline is that has enormous fundamental
[2:17:15.760 --> 2:17:20.560]  connections to bill gates and bill gates of course has fundamental connections
[2:17:20.560 --> 2:17:24.400]  to all these dark suits who are pushing the
[2:17:24.400 --> 2:17:28.000]  the quote virus policy in all the different countries
[2:17:28.000 --> 2:17:31.680]  we have a the science advisor to johnson
[2:17:31.680 --> 2:17:35.040]  in other words he's buddy handler guy called valence
[2:17:35.040 --> 2:17:42.000]  who was a long long time executive of black so smith kline we have the chief
[2:17:42.000 --> 2:17:47.920]  medical officer guy called witty who received 40 million dollars
[2:17:47.920 --> 2:17:52.720]  for a project from bill gates and you of course know all about
[2:17:52.720 --> 2:17:56.720]  fauci and berks and all the rest of them this is just a web
[2:17:56.720 --> 2:18:02.720]  and the politicians are basically bystanders they're just looking on
[2:18:02.720 --> 2:18:06.080]  or they might make the statements but it's it's it's the
[2:18:06.080 --> 2:18:09.920]  the technocrats answering to the same and i totally agree with you and i know
[2:18:09.920 --> 2:18:12.960]  you've got problems with trump so do i but he's come out and said he thinks
[2:18:12.960 --> 2:18:16.560]  the numbers are overblown he thinks it's meant to kill the economy he's trying
[2:18:16.560 --> 2:18:20.000]  to get the public not to go along what do you make of trump not going along with
[2:18:20.000 --> 2:18:24.960]  it partially what i think that um any um
[2:18:24.960 --> 2:18:31.040]  politician whatever they may be who looks upon the situation that
[2:18:31.040 --> 2:18:37.680]  that we face um we'll we'll see that we're facing an absolute catastrophe
[2:18:37.680 --> 2:18:41.680]  um you know johnson came to power just before
[2:18:41.680 --> 2:18:46.800]  a christmas with a massive majority big you know honeymoon period in front of
[2:18:46.800 --> 2:18:51.280]  him um and now the economy um as in america
[2:18:51.280 --> 2:18:55.120]  has been devastated and the politicians are going to be stuck
[2:18:55.120 --> 2:18:58.880]  with trying to pick up the pieces as best they can and when the economy goes
[2:18:58.880 --> 2:19:02.160]  down it's going to be trump and johnson and balasaro that get blamed
[2:19:02.160 --> 2:19:05.360]  by the very same medical tyranny that engineered it that's why the politicians
[2:19:05.360 --> 2:19:09.840]  need to stop being politicians and be statesmen and expose these bastards
[2:19:09.840 --> 2:19:14.720]  exactly that's the idea that the politicians get get the blame
[2:19:14.720 --> 2:19:18.480]  but you know when it comes down to it people like johnson
[2:19:18.480 --> 2:19:22.720]  and he's like around the world well you know don't start complaining when you
[2:19:22.720 --> 2:19:25.280]  get blamed for it because in the end
[2:19:25.280 --> 2:19:28.640]  you have to sign the papers officially legally
[2:19:28.640 --> 2:19:33.040]  you are the prime minister so therefore you could have stood up to this
[2:19:33.040 --> 2:19:37.360]  you could have said to ferguson hold on a minute half a million people
[2:19:37.360 --> 2:19:40.800]  david ike stay there because i want to ask what's coming next and how we can
[2:19:40.800 --> 2:19:47.520]  stop this if there's still time as men age they often experience a slowdown

[2:20:35.280 --> 2:20:38.880]  never been a better time than right now super
[2:20:38.880 --> 2:20:45.920]  pale vitality at infostore.com i've hunted a lot of big game at long distances with
[2:20:45.920 --> 2:20:49.680]  high caliber rifles and when you shoot an elk at say
[2:20:49.680 --> 2:20:54.480]  600 yards even if you hit them right in the heart they'll still run
[2:20:54.480 --> 2:20:59.200]  50 60 70 maybe 100 yards they've got that adrenaline
[2:20:59.200 --> 2:21:02.640]  pumping through their arteries and through their veins but all of a sudden
[2:21:02.640 --> 2:21:06.560]  they slow down they realize what's happened they fall over
[2:21:06.560 --> 2:21:10.960]  and they die then you go bag them and haul them back in
[2:21:10.960 --> 2:21:14.480]  well that's what's going to happen to the entire world now
[2:21:14.480 --> 2:21:18.800]  and that's what the economic numbers show is that we've been shot
[2:21:18.800 --> 2:21:22.720]  right in the heart and for the first world it's going to mean a long
[2:21:22.720 --> 2:21:26.720]  horrible depression and a lot of death well for the third world it's going to
[2:21:26.720 --> 2:21:29.440]  mean probably over 100 million dead according to the UN and I believe their
[2:21:29.440 --> 2:21:33.440]  numbers because it's the very UN that's orchestrated this to
[2:21:33.440 --> 2:21:36.640]  depopulate the third world so that all the leftists had thought it was their
[2:21:36.640 --> 2:21:39.440]  revolution to get rid of Trump you're a bunch of suckers and you've
[2:21:39.440 --> 2:21:42.240]  bought into something better than what Hitler did
[2:21:42.240 --> 2:21:46.480]  ladies and gentlemen info wars can now offer high quality storeable food
[2:21:46.480 --> 2:21:49.760]  again other manufacturers were sold out
[2:21:49.760 --> 2:21:53.200]  eight weeks ago and they told people they had food
[2:21:53.200 --> 2:21:56.480]  most folks never were delivered their food well when
[2:21:56.480 --> 2:22:00.480]  our sponsors food began to run short they just
[2:22:00.480 --> 2:22:03.840]  then it sales till they open more factories and secured
[2:22:03.840 --> 2:22:06.800]  more food so if you eat your orders in right now
[2:22:06.800 --> 2:22:10.720]  they can take new orders and get it to you quickly they'll probably have to
[2:22:10.720 --> 2:22:15.120]  suspend orders very very soon again because the lockdown of the economy
[2:22:15.120 --> 2:22:19.760]  is killing food distribution farming you name it and now it's mainstream news
[2:22:19.760 --> 2:22:23.760]  the food shortages and delivery are already starting to happen
[2:22:23.760 --> 2:22:28.560]  if Trump can turn the economy back on and rest control of our system away from
[2:22:28.560 --> 2:22:31.600]  the globalist things may be okay but it looks like
[2:22:31.600 --> 2:22:34.640]  it's going to get very very rough so again ladies and gentlemen now is the
[2:22:34.640 --> 2:22:38.000]  time to secure the number one thing you need high quality storeable food
[2:22:38.000 --> 2:22:40.640]  ready to get to you and your family now if you get your orders in
[2:22:40.640 --> 2:23:02.880]  the forestore.com you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:23:02.880 --> 2:23:10.160]  alex jones the cure to fake news coming to you live from austin
[2:23:10.160 --> 2:23:12.960]  texas
[2:23:12.960 --> 2:23:17.520]  well i knew that the mass of draconia censorship was coming
[2:23:17.520 --> 2:23:19.840]  and i knew they were going to launch the medical tyranny because i could read
[2:23:19.840 --> 2:23:23.120]  what the rocker feller foundation the billamona gates foundation were saying
[2:23:23.120 --> 2:23:26.800]  i made a film about bill gates he's a big part of an end game
[2:23:26.800 --> 2:23:31.680]  in 2007 and it predicts a worldwide medical tyranny
[2:23:31.680 --> 2:23:34.880]  and i know about bill gates his dad ran plant parenthood
[2:23:34.880 --> 2:23:41.040]  his mom's on the ibm board ibm was set up to carry out depopulation
[2:23:41.040 --> 2:23:44.080]  this is all on record there's bullet surprise winning books on him
[2:23:44.080 --> 2:23:48.160]  and so gates is a front man for this larger network
[2:23:48.160 --> 2:23:52.000]  and david ike really scared them and hit the zeitgeist
[2:23:52.000 --> 2:23:56.000]  and was reaching i don't know extra 10 million people a week conservatively
[2:23:56.000 --> 2:23:58.960]  they've tried to ban him now it's backfiring people are going to david
[2:23:58.960 --> 2:24:05.680]  ike dot com they're going to ic k o n ic dot com iconic dot com
[2:24:05.680 --> 2:24:08.800]  and that's what i love seeing he's working with london real
[2:24:08.800 --> 2:24:11.840]  he's doing more shows i noticed as they tried to oppress david
[2:24:11.840 --> 2:24:16.160]  and suppress david i've never seen david look so happy and so sparkly eyed
[2:24:16.160 --> 2:24:20.480]  i'm the same way because we've been proven right and we see the fear of the
[2:24:20.480 --> 2:24:24.480]  globalist if they were so powerful they would just ignore us like they used to
[2:24:24.480 --> 2:24:28.480]  but now they can't ignore us because as david said a few weeks ago
[2:24:28.480 --> 2:24:32.560]  i am more powerful than these new world order people and you the listeners
[2:24:32.560 --> 2:24:36.560]  are more powerful and they know that that's why they want to make you dependent
[2:24:36.560 --> 2:24:40.080]  that's why they want to poison you that's why they want to shutter the doors of
[2:24:40.080 --> 2:24:42.960]  perception so david i want to get into solutions and
[2:24:42.960 --> 2:24:45.600]  what's technically happening in the world the limited time we have with you
[2:24:45.600 --> 2:24:49.920]  today we're very appreciative but but but speak to you are more powerful we are
[2:24:49.920 --> 2:24:53.360]  more powerful than they are in that unconditional love
[2:24:53.360 --> 2:24:56.480]  instead of being scared opening up to the universe
[2:24:56.480 --> 2:25:00.240]  and and why they're so afraid of that
[2:25:00.240 --> 2:25:05.600]  well you know um when you look at any situation it can look a certain way if
[2:25:05.600 --> 2:25:09.440]  you look at it from a particular angle and you look at what's happening with
[2:25:09.440 --> 2:25:13.040]  the censorship and you can say oh look how powerful they
[2:25:13.040 --> 2:25:16.640]  are they can censor people but you look at it from another
[2:25:16.640 --> 2:25:20.000]  angle and it's saying something very different
[2:25:20.000 --> 2:25:24.160]  you know just take me i'm a guy i'm living in a little flat on the island
[2:25:24.160 --> 2:25:28.640]  white just off the south coast of england by the way where they've
[2:25:28.640 --> 2:25:32.800]  chosen the island white where i live to run the
[2:25:32.800 --> 2:25:36.640]  the tracking trial for the for the quote virus
[2:25:36.640 --> 2:25:42.160]  um you know which of course i i'm having nothing to do with it but
[2:25:42.160 --> 2:25:45.120]  i'm on this little island in this little flat
[2:25:45.120 --> 2:25:49.600]  um and i put out information and um i put out videos
[2:25:49.600 --> 2:25:57.280]  and write books but they powerful so powerful control silicon valley
[2:25:57.280 --> 2:26:00.560]  they control governments they control the banking system
[2:26:00.560 --> 2:26:08.480]  they control the big pharma um cartel uh they um control the whole
[2:26:08.480 --> 2:26:16.800]  institutions of uh of controlling society and yet with all that control
[2:26:16.800 --> 2:26:21.280]  they um have to run around like someone shouted fire
[2:26:21.280 --> 2:26:26.080]  to stop um someone being heard in a little flat on the island white
[2:26:26.080 --> 2:26:29.520]  now that tells you where the real power is and the real power
[2:26:29.520 --> 2:26:34.720]  is with the truth which has a much more powerful frequency than lies and
[2:26:34.720 --> 2:26:38.000]  mendacity and what what we're looking at here
[2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:41.200]  while it may seem all we're imposing our power
[2:26:41.200 --> 2:26:45.520]  actually what we're looking at is desperation for this reason
[2:26:45.520 --> 2:26:50.320]  um they have played their hand now they've walked in the room the doors
[2:26:50.320 --> 2:26:53.280]  clicked behind them they've played their hand
[2:26:53.280 --> 2:26:56.960]  and now they're running for home uh and um
[2:26:56.960 --> 2:27:02.000]  they're hoping they get to the line complete uh control through AI
[2:27:02.000 --> 2:27:06.160]  before enough people have woken up um to stop them
[2:27:06.160 --> 2:27:10.400]  um but what they are building this on
[2:27:10.400 --> 2:27:17.840]  their run for home is a a narrative about this virus
[2:27:17.840 --> 2:27:23.760]  that is absolutely insane it's built on sand
[2:27:23.760 --> 2:27:30.320]  oh it's built it's built on an absolute air all you have to do
[2:27:30.320 --> 2:27:34.960]  is is just pull a few little threads and the whole thing collapses
[2:27:34.960 --> 2:27:40.000]  because the story is insane they're selling a deadly virus
[2:27:40.000 --> 2:27:42.960]  that doesn't freaking exist and they're only
[2:27:42.960 --> 2:27:47.360]  managing to make it appear exist uh to exist with a test
[2:27:47.360 --> 2:27:50.480]  that doesn't test by the way just briefly david when you were saying that
[2:27:50.480 --> 2:27:54.800]  already three months ago i thought okay there's real weaponized viruses they
[2:27:54.800 --> 2:27:57.920]  want to own it they want to control it but now it's coming out they admit
[2:27:57.920 --> 2:28:03.680]  they authorized totally fake test that say everybody is uh
[2:28:03.680 --> 2:28:08.720]  infected and i'm sure you know tanzania sent it off and said papayas and goats
[2:28:08.720 --> 2:28:11.600]  came up positive it's totally fake
[2:28:11.600 --> 2:28:18.320]  yeah they they they sent off a sample from pawpaw and it came back
[2:28:18.320 --> 2:28:26.480]  positive for covid 19 it's insane so all this testing is merely to try to make
[2:28:26.480 --> 2:28:30.800]  it look as if it's everywhere when actually it's nowhere
[2:28:30.800 --> 2:28:35.280]  so when you look at that alex the the whole foundation
[2:28:35.280 --> 2:28:43.120]  is is is is air and wind how can they defend that without censoring
[2:28:43.120 --> 2:28:48.320]  uh people exposing that they have to it's not that they all will
[2:28:48.320 --> 2:28:52.080]  will impose our power well there's another one all these meat packing plants
[2:28:52.080 --> 2:28:55.280]  no one's gotten sick they test thousands hundreds have it
[2:28:55.280 --> 2:29:00.240]  everyone's asymptomatic nobody's sick well a couple of things alex right
[2:29:00.240 --> 2:29:03.840]  first of all they have no symptoms because there is no virus
[2:29:03.840 --> 2:29:07.200]  and here's another thing which might lead us into another area because they're
[2:29:07.200 --> 2:29:10.880]  they're using this to kill vast numbers of old people in this country it's
[2:29:10.880 --> 2:29:14.800]  absolutely unbelievable but why do old people
[2:29:14.800 --> 2:29:22.560]  uh die from this virus and young people don't um oh well it's this no no
[2:29:22.560 --> 2:29:26.320]  i'll tell you why it is because young people
[2:29:26.320 --> 2:29:33.120]  overwhelmingly do not have other conditions that threaten their
[2:29:33.120 --> 2:29:37.440]  life which really kills them they they don't have them
[2:29:37.440 --> 2:29:41.200]  so because young people don't have other morbidities
[2:29:41.200 --> 2:29:46.480]  those other reasons why they die don't exist overwhelmingly
[2:29:46.480 --> 2:29:51.680]  to be labeled COVID-19 deaths but older people and the older you get
[2:29:51.680 --> 2:29:55.440]  the more of these other conditions and morbidities you have that
[2:29:55.440 --> 2:30:01.440]  that are going to end your life so they have endless potential with old people
[2:30:01.440 --> 2:30:06.400]  to um uh say it's a COVID-19 and by the way now the president agrees with you
[2:30:06.400 --> 2:30:09.040]  and that's been proven right but those of us that know this
[2:30:09.040 --> 2:30:12.800]  must get this out to everyone else that doesn't know or this fraud is going to
[2:30:12.800 --> 2:30:15.280]  succeed
[2:30:15.760 --> 2:30:22.000]  but the other thing is um i hear them saying what it seems as if uh people
[2:30:22.000 --> 2:30:25.280]  aren't getting immunity even people that have had it they're not getting
[2:30:25.280 --> 2:30:28.480]  immunity well why are they getting immunity because they've never had
[2:30:28.480 --> 2:30:32.800]  anything to get immunity from so what they that's why it doesn't
[2:30:32.800 --> 2:30:36.080]  act like any virus that ever acted before because you're right it's just
[2:30:36.080 --> 2:30:40.080]  completely made up they're testing people for a genetic
[2:30:40.080 --> 2:30:44.080]  material not a virus provable fact and then um
[2:30:44.080 --> 2:30:48.080]  they're testing positive oh isolate for 14 days
[2:30:48.080 --> 2:30:52.240]  then they test them again for the genetic material that's in their body not
[2:30:52.240 --> 2:30:55.280]  the virus oh they've tested positive again there's
[2:30:55.280 --> 2:30:58.960]  no immunity but of course they've tested positive twice
[2:30:58.960 --> 2:31:02.640]  they've tested positive for the same genetic material they had then and they
[2:31:02.640 --> 2:31:06.160]  still got it's it's crazy and so would a papaya
[2:31:06.160 --> 2:31:10.320]  and so would a turtle out of the yard that's crazy
[2:31:10.320 --> 2:31:17.600]  but this is why they have to censor on the um extraordinary scale that they
[2:31:17.600 --> 2:31:23.360]  are because their um their narrative is so
[2:31:23.360 --> 2:31:26.800]  shock full of holes why would they go with such a shoddy narrative because
[2:31:26.800 --> 2:31:28.880]  you've been proven right it is a giant hoax
[2:31:28.880 --> 2:31:31.600]  why would they go with something so ridiculous i guess because you can't
[2:31:31.600 --> 2:31:35.360]  ever prove it so it just becomes a war of propaganda
[2:31:35.360 --> 2:31:38.640]  well i you know i i mentioned this the last time we
[2:31:38.640 --> 2:31:44.080]  we uh spoke um if you release um a and i'm not saying these bio weapons don't
[2:31:44.080 --> 2:31:47.520]  exist my god they exist but if you release one of them you lose
[2:31:47.520 --> 2:31:51.200]  you lose control of it if you if you have a fake virus which you're
[2:31:51.200 --> 2:31:57.280]  which you're actually manipulating um the public perception of via a fake
[2:31:57.280 --> 2:32:00.640]  test it's like a a german doctor actually at it
[2:32:00.640 --> 2:32:04.240]  dead right weeks ago he said there's not a new virus
[2:32:04.240 --> 2:32:07.360]  there's a new test and if there wasn't a new test none of this will be
[2:32:07.360 --> 2:32:10.400]  happening um and and you also fix the death
[2:32:10.400 --> 2:32:14.400]  certificate so by that means you are controlling
[2:32:14.400 --> 2:32:18.240]  a virus that doesn't exist you're making it appear to exist so you have control
[2:32:18.240 --> 2:32:22.240]  you can make the numbers go up you can make it flat line or second wave you
[2:32:22.240 --> 2:32:25.680]  can make it go again uh so you have control of it
[2:32:25.680 --> 2:32:30.480]  but in doing that it means you're very very vulnerable to the fact that you're
[2:32:30.480 --> 2:32:35.680]  lying uh and and the you know when you've got final
[2:32:35.680 --> 2:32:38.320]  segment david ike you're on fire as usual we'll come back and talk about
[2:32:38.320 --> 2:32:41.840]  solutions when we come back with david ike
[2:32:41.840 --> 2:32:46.720]  globalism is all about making the nation state and the population itself
[2:32:46.720 --> 2:32:51.440]  obsolete non-essential that's why they position it
[2:32:51.440 --> 2:32:56.240]  with economic tariffs taxes and controls to our family farms and
[2:32:56.240 --> 2:33:00.800]  industry that's based in united states has to shut down or be part of a large
[2:33:00.800 --> 2:33:03.840]  corporate conglomerate that's part of making us
[2:33:03.840 --> 2:33:09.840]  obsolete so that as the human world is phased out they can simply look at us
[2:33:09.840 --> 2:33:13.040]  and say because again you are not essential
[2:33:13.040 --> 2:33:17.040]  that's what the robots and all of this is about it's about
[2:33:17.040 --> 2:33:20.240]  setting it up where we're no longer in charge of our lives
[2:33:20.240 --> 2:33:24.000]  we can be told to stay on our houses natural shut up
[2:33:24.000 --> 2:33:27.760]  this world doesn't belong to people anyways it belongs to the new ai gods
[2:33:27.760 --> 2:33:31.360]  the rich elitists that have merged with machines yeah that sounds completely
[2:33:31.360 --> 2:33:34.960]  insane doesn't it that's actually the public plan
[2:33:34.960 --> 2:33:38.800]  they're pushing these people are completely psychotic
[2:33:38.800 --> 2:33:44.560]  and made hitler look like a choir boy i'm cutting this ad on may 10th 2020 and

[2:33:55.280 --> 2:33:58.960]  enough for us people to get enough profit to operate this operation

[2:34:50.000 --> 2:34:52.560]  long run it'll end up being better for myself
[2:34:52.560 --> 2:34:55.920]  everybody else in this world we live together in i understand what comes
[2:34:55.920 --> 2:34:59.360]  around goes around you pretty quick you show and i live that and i fundamentally
[2:34:59.360 --> 2:35:02.720]  to cellular level understand it now if i would have
[2:35:02.720 --> 2:35:05.840]  hyped up the virus was going to kill three four five million people like the
[2:35:05.840 --> 2:35:09.280]  un did i was told five times more supplements
[2:35:09.280 --> 2:35:13.760]  but you know what i didn't do that but i said on a routine basis regardless
[2:35:13.760 --> 2:35:17.440]  people are vitamin d deficient people are deficient i had
[2:35:17.440 --> 2:35:20.320]  i had so many other issues you need those products
[2:35:20.320 --> 2:35:24.240]  regardless so we started selling out of vital mineral fusion all the other
[2:35:24.240 --> 2:35:27.520]  products i cut the prices from 30 percent off
[2:35:27.520 --> 2:35:31.280]  to 60 percent off because i knew it was the right thing to do
[2:35:31.280 --> 2:35:34.160]  during a crisis to make sure people were incentivized
[2:35:34.160 --> 2:35:37.760]  to up their bodies defenses but now i'm telling you
[2:35:37.760 --> 2:35:42.480]  with the economic crisis going on get your storeable food now
[2:35:42.480 --> 2:35:47.920]  the lockdown is permanent dictatorship the lockdown is designed to have the
[2:35:47.920 --> 2:35:52.160]  public accept their basic rights being suspended
[2:35:52.160 --> 2:35:56.320]  and a global medical tyranny led by the who
[2:35:56.320 --> 2:36:01.920]  and the bill millen gates foundation in full control many will submit through
[2:36:01.920 --> 2:36:05.520]  fear others will be bought off but in the end
[2:36:05.520 --> 2:36:09.520]  the globalists admit they're building a post human world
[2:36:09.520 --> 2:36:14.240]  and now that we're inside the cage it's going to move very very quickly
[2:36:14.240 --> 2:36:19.840]  into its end game submission to this is a form of living death
[2:36:19.840 --> 2:36:23.600]  and committing the next generation and our own generation
[2:36:23.600 --> 2:36:28.880]  to a living hell that cannot be imagined until you're actually experiencing
[2:36:28.880 --> 2:36:32.800]  this this is your dignity your soul your future being
[2:36:32.800 --> 2:36:36.960]  poured inside out this is a scientific dictatorship
[2:36:36.960 --> 2:36:43.360]  taking full control of humanity for its own selfless disgusting power trip
[2:36:43.360 --> 2:36:59.280]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:37:00.960 --> 2:37:04.880]  final segment with david ike we need your introduction i'm alex jones your
[2:37:04.880 --> 2:37:08.640]  host please remember we knew the censorship was coming
[2:37:08.640 --> 2:37:12.720]  we built this infrastructure we built the satellite uplinks the giant
[2:37:12.720 --> 2:37:17.200]  streaming systems all of it knowing mass censorship was coming and we need to
[2:37:17.200 --> 2:37:21.520]  have our own system google's worth 700 billion dollars
[2:37:21.520 --> 2:37:24.880]  apple's worth a trillion and they've got all their big fancy systems we've done
[2:37:24.880 --> 2:37:28.160]  this with millions of dollars and it cost millions and millions and
[2:37:28.160 --> 2:37:31.280]  millions in bandwidth to do what we're doing in fact i had the crew come in
[2:37:31.280 --> 2:37:34.080]  last week and they said even though we got better deals on bandwidth they said
[2:37:34.080 --> 2:37:38.480]  look at what this is costing just some david ike interviews we mirrored have
[2:37:38.480 --> 2:37:43.680]  like five million views on band on video the doctors press conference that got
[2:37:43.680 --> 2:37:46.320]  censored that's got almost two million views
[2:37:46.320 --> 2:37:49.920]  all these other things that have been taken down now have a place to go
[2:37:49.920 --> 2:37:53.360]  now it's making me a major target and i'm not going to get into that yet i may
[2:37:53.360 --> 2:37:55.520]  have to though but they're coming after me folks
[2:37:55.520 --> 2:37:59.040]  you saw they put this woman in jail that worked for fauci this virologist
[2:37:59.040 --> 2:38:03.280]  that's been exposing him for putting cancer viruses and vaccines
[2:38:03.280 --> 2:38:06.640]  this is a very dangerous place to be but we're all in danger
[2:38:06.640 --> 2:38:10.960]  and so getting on our knees is not the way to go so info or store
[2:38:10.960 --> 2:38:13.600]  dot com we've got the biggest sales that we've run
[2:38:13.600 --> 2:38:17.680]  since last christmas uh we want to sell this big until christmas again

[2:38:34.080 --> 2:38:37.600]  off vaso beats 40 percent off these are really all high quality products we have
[2:38:37.600 --> 2:38:41.920]  the new 5g kills t-shirts where they're trying to
[2:38:41.920 --> 2:38:45.360]  censor you if you expose 5g everywhere well
[2:38:45.360 --> 2:38:48.640]  typically wear the shirt and it's got info worse dot com in the back and don't
[2:38:48.640 --> 2:38:51.840]  forget you can also go to davidike.com and find all of his censored books
[2:38:51.840 --> 2:38:55.280]  and information as well okay in the nine minutes we have left david you
[2:38:55.280 --> 2:38:59.520]  you wanted to get into the evil of bill gates uh we're gonna play a few clips of
[2:38:59.520 --> 2:39:02.480]  him and you wanted to get into their targeting old people which bill gates
[2:39:02.480 --> 2:39:06.000]  admits they're doing but here's bill gates last week on cnn
[2:39:06.000 --> 2:39:10.160]  radio listeners can't see it read zarkaria the billderberg group member
[2:39:10.160 --> 2:39:12.960]  he says oh things are coming back to normal this is gonna be horrible and
[2:39:12.960 --> 2:39:16.800]  long and bill gates looks like he has this
[2:39:16.800 --> 2:39:22.160]  murderous psychotic smile on his face here it is economy is not going to be
[2:39:22.160 --> 2:39:26.480]  anything like it was this going to take a long time to recover it's going to be
[2:39:26.480 --> 2:39:29.360]  you know people are going to be surprised at how slow and how
[2:39:29.360 --> 2:39:33.600]  how fitful this is why is this going to take a long time to recover it's going
[2:39:33.600 --> 2:39:37.920]  to be you know people are going to be surprised at how slow and how
[2:39:37.920 --> 2:39:42.560]  how fitful this is that's a tradeoff society is making because
[2:39:42.560 --> 2:39:47.680]  of very very high medical costs and a lack of willingness to say
[2:39:47.680 --> 2:39:51.120]  you know is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for
[2:39:51.120 --> 2:39:55.040]  that patient would it be better not to lay off
[2:39:55.040 --> 2:40:00.000]  the those ten teachers and to make that tradeoff in medical costs but that's
[2:40:00.000 --> 2:40:02.960]  called the death panel uh and you're not supposed to have
[2:40:02.960 --> 2:40:06.240]  that discussion teaching people that if we kill old
[2:40:06.240 --> 2:40:09.600]  people that will have more money i mean he's
[2:40:09.600 --> 2:40:14.000]  literally up there selling death did you see how excited he got in his face
[2:40:14.000 --> 2:40:17.200]  but you're right the eyes look like plastic beads
[2:40:17.200 --> 2:40:20.640]  they he looks like a mannequin he looks like a ventriloquist all
[2:40:20.640 --> 2:40:24.880]  he he looks like an automaton like a chuckie cheese
[2:40:24.880 --> 2:40:31.360]  animatronic puppet well i've been writing my books for
[2:40:31.360 --> 2:40:38.160]  well decades now that this network is not human as we perceive human and
[2:40:38.160 --> 2:40:42.960]  what i i say they are and i explain why in the books
[2:40:42.960 --> 2:40:48.240]  is biological ai see where they're pushing the human race you know all
[2:40:48.240 --> 2:40:52.000]  this synthetic biology and all that um
[2:40:52.000 --> 2:40:57.280]  the human form the human body is being pushed in the same direction of where
[2:40:57.280 --> 2:41:00.720]  they're already are so when you look at
[2:41:00.720 --> 2:41:04.640]  these psychopaths you look at look at zuckerberg
[2:41:04.640 --> 2:41:09.360]  and and and look at tony blare even and even though he's way down the pecking
[2:41:09.360 --> 2:41:14.400]  order he is and and you see their mouth
[2:41:14.400 --> 2:41:21.440]  smile in terms of gaits bloody rarely um but their eyes don't smile
[2:41:21.440 --> 2:41:26.320]  with their mouth and when your eyes and your mouth are not speaking the same
[2:41:26.320 --> 2:41:29.440]  language then you're dealing with with some level of
[2:41:29.440 --> 2:41:33.360]  of of fraud and in terms of gaits it's
[2:41:33.360 --> 2:41:37.360]  absolutely fantastic now if you think of this
[2:41:37.360 --> 2:41:44.560]  biological ai concept um what do these people not have
[2:41:44.560 --> 2:41:48.960]  they don't have any um what we would call humanity they have no
[2:41:48.960 --> 2:41:53.040]  empathy they have no compassion what am i describing
[2:41:53.040 --> 2:41:57.120]  i'm describing basically a computer program you know when you
[2:41:57.120 --> 2:42:00.240]  put a computer program into into a computer
[2:42:00.240 --> 2:42:04.160]  that um has the effect of doing horrendous things
[2:42:04.160 --> 2:42:08.640]  the computer doesn't have any emotional
[2:42:08.640 --> 2:42:13.040]  filter or or consequence it just does it it's like press enter does it
[2:42:13.040 --> 2:42:16.400]  and that's what these people are like this is why they have no
[2:42:16.400 --> 2:42:22.000]  compassion they have no empathy so you've got gaits this man with the dead
[2:42:22.000 --> 2:42:25.920]  eyes there's no life there's no soul there um
[2:42:25.920 --> 2:42:31.200]  is um quite happy in fact you'll be getting an off on it
[2:42:31.200 --> 2:42:36.400]  to see literally billions of people in terrible straits
[2:42:36.400 --> 2:42:39.840]  just so we can get a vaccine inside them for the next stage
[2:42:39.840 --> 2:42:43.600]  and he admits oh 700 000 will get sick which we know is a way under us but
[2:42:43.600 --> 2:42:45.920]  but i agree with you but there's a subtle to here
[2:42:45.920 --> 2:42:49.200]  they don't have a motion about hurting us in fact they actually do have a motion
[2:42:49.200 --> 2:42:54.400]  they enjoy hurting people yeah that's what they that's what their program
[2:42:54.400 --> 2:42:59.120]  to do that's what psychopaths do you look at the uh the hair test of um
[2:42:59.120 --> 2:43:02.400]  psychopathic traits named after the guy who came up with it
[2:43:02.400 --> 2:43:06.160]  and um you take off all the psychopathic traits
[2:43:06.160 --> 2:43:10.320]  no empathy is right at the top and you are looking at the character traits of
[2:43:10.320 --> 2:43:13.760]  these people you know i mean someone like
[2:43:13.760 --> 2:43:17.440]  wachiski and and and zuckerberg what level
[2:43:17.440 --> 2:43:21.680]  of psychopathy and lack of empathy do you need
[2:43:21.680 --> 2:43:28.880]  to have to just delete vast numbers of people's um right to a free opinion
[2:43:28.880 --> 2:43:35.120]  just to wipe away medical doctors um from your platform for this only reason
[2:43:35.120 --> 2:43:39.680]  that they are saying the wrong things uh by the agenda that you are by the way
[2:43:39.680 --> 2:43:41.680]  has been proven true in the limited time we have left
[2:43:41.680 --> 2:43:45.120]  get into killing old people recapping that because
[2:43:45.120 --> 2:43:49.360]  they admit that's really the agenda this is this is really important and that
[2:43:49.360 --> 2:43:53.120]  that clip was very appropriate there of uh Bill Gates
[2:43:53.120 --> 2:43:58.400]  talking about this i um have quoted a man in my books
[2:43:58.400 --> 2:44:03.760]  over the years who um his name was uh was Dr Richard Day
[2:44:03.760 --> 2:44:07.200]  and he was an executive of Planned Parenthood the same as
[2:44:07.200 --> 2:44:10.560]  Gates's father was involved in as you mentioned earlier
[2:44:10.560 --> 2:44:15.120]  and uh Richard Day um stood up in front of a
[2:44:15.120 --> 2:44:18.000]  meeting of pediatricians in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania
[2:44:18.000 --> 2:44:23.360]  in 1969 and no one knows why he did this but i'm glad he did
[2:44:23.360 --> 2:44:26.880]  he asked him to turn off recording equipment and not take notes because he
[2:44:26.880 --> 2:44:29.600]  was going to tell him how the world was going to change because basically what
[2:44:29.600 --> 2:44:32.880]  he represented as a gopher was going to change it
[2:44:32.880 --> 2:44:36.880]  and what he said that night and in a book i i wrote called phantom self i
[2:44:36.880 --> 2:44:41.440]  i detail at length what he said it's unbelievable
[2:44:41.440 --> 2:44:46.800]  when you look at current events um and uh he he talked he described the internet
[2:44:46.800 --> 2:44:49.840]  in 1969 they're supposed to have been invented in the
[2:44:49.840 --> 2:44:56.320]  what 1980s um and um he uh set a stream of things in detail that have
[2:44:56.320 --> 2:44:59.920]  actually happened and one of the things he talked about
[2:44:59.920 --> 2:45:05.440]  was what he called the demise pill where the plan was eventually
[2:45:05.440 --> 2:45:08.560]  that you'll only be allowed to live a certain amount of time
[2:45:08.560 --> 2:45:11.680]  and when you reach that point you take a demise pill
[2:45:11.680 --> 2:45:16.000]  and he even described it this is the level of psychopathy
[2:45:16.000 --> 2:45:20.400]  of all you know the what would happen is mom and dad they would
[2:45:20.400 --> 2:45:24.400]  they would they'd have a party with their kids and oh mom and dad have
[2:45:24.400 --> 2:45:28.240]  done very well what's in what's a good life and then at the end of the party
[2:45:28.240 --> 2:45:31.600]  they take the demise pill when you reach a certain age
[2:45:31.600 --> 2:45:35.200]  so what they are they've had this targeting of old people for a long
[2:45:35.200 --> 2:45:39.520]  time and this the fake virus has given them the chance to do it
[2:45:39.520 --> 2:45:43.760]  so we at david i got comma have been approached by
[2:45:43.760 --> 2:45:48.000]  nurses and working care homes who are saying that basically
[2:45:48.000 --> 2:45:51.680]  it's murder that's the word they use and that's why they suddenly have higher
[2:45:51.680 --> 2:45:55.360]  numbers they kick the families out and they kill them
[2:45:55.360 --> 2:45:59.520]  exactly what they're doing according to these nurses
[2:45:59.520 --> 2:46:05.280]  is they're designating people with COVID-19 old people in nursing homes and
[2:46:05.280 --> 2:46:07.920]  care homes with no test even though the test is
[2:46:07.920 --> 2:46:11.440]  nonsense they don't even go through that you know facade
[2:46:11.440 --> 2:46:16.720]  just say they've got it and if one has it or says to have had it then by
[2:46:16.720 --> 2:46:19.760]  definition they to take it they've all got it
[2:46:19.760 --> 2:46:23.120]  and when that happens doctors stop coming in
[2:46:23.120 --> 2:46:28.240]  and and you know this one nurse was saying we're begging for antibiotics for
[2:46:28.240 --> 2:46:31.440]  our old people but that they what we can't get them
[2:46:31.440 --> 2:46:34.720]  and then they die and when they die they designate them
[2:46:34.720 --> 2:46:38.800]  COVID-19 but one of the other things that's happening and this is
[2:46:38.800 --> 2:46:41.360]  and now even hit the mainstream media in this country
[2:46:41.360 --> 2:46:48.400]  hallelujah is the pressure on old people from doctors their family doctors
[2:46:48.400 --> 2:46:52.240]  and from hospital doctors and medical staff
[2:46:52.240 --> 2:46:58.960]  for old people to um sign do not resuscitate forms
[2:46:58.960 --> 2:47:03.520]  so um when when they uh they need to be uh you know
[2:47:03.520 --> 2:47:07.280]  that's right be a hero die so there's room in the hospitals that are actually
[2:47:07.280 --> 2:47:09.440]  empty i know you said you can only an hour you got to go
[2:47:09.440 --> 2:47:12.640]  two minute break finish finish this point on the other side you'll be gone at
[2:47:12.640 --> 2:47:16.080]  five after david ike sir gas and we have a very special report

[2:47:40.000 --> 2:47:44.880]  at the subsistence starvation level on top of all the millions already starving
[2:47:44.880 --> 2:47:48.960]  because the global lockdown that is hundreds of times worse than all the
[2:47:48.960 --> 2:47:53.040]  deaths in the world caused by covet 19 and the very people that cooked it up
[2:47:53.040 --> 2:47:56.080]  and gave it to the chai comms at the world health organization
[2:47:56.080 --> 2:47:59.680]  with bill gates involved are now the ones running the operation
[2:47:59.680 --> 2:48:03.600]  to shut down society created depression and forcibly inoculate everybody this
[2:48:03.600 --> 2:48:07.120]  is insane ladies and gentlemen they succeed it's over

[2:48:37.120 --> 2:48:40.480]  the globalists have taken the gloves off and they've taken the mask off and
[2:48:40.480 --> 2:48:43.440]  they're like yeah you're taking implantable chips

[2:50:13.920 --> 2:50:18.960]  yeah well it's um it's essentially dictated i mean you know it's like a
[2:50:18.960 --> 2:50:23.600]  transnational corporation you know you have a headquarters in the shadows in
[2:50:23.600 --> 2:50:26.480]  this case and then you have the the difference of
[2:50:26.480 --> 2:50:32.160]  subsidiary networks in each country that impose the will of the central
[2:50:32.160 --> 2:50:36.400]  if you like headquarters of this cult in their particular area that's why the
[2:50:36.400 --> 2:50:40.400]  same things are happening in all the different countries and
[2:50:40.400 --> 2:50:43.840]  the old people are absolutely being targeted and
[2:50:43.840 --> 2:50:51.440]  you know when you look at the goals of the climate
[2:50:51.440 --> 2:50:55.200]  hopes the human cause climate hoax and you look at the goals and the
[2:50:55.200 --> 2:50:58.640]  happenings of this virus scam they are the same
[2:50:58.640 --> 2:51:02.560]  and one of the things of course that the climate cult has been doing
[2:51:02.560 --> 2:51:07.840]  is demonizing old people it's those old people they've destroyed our world this
[2:51:07.840 --> 2:51:10.000]  is what Greta Thunberg's always talking about
[2:51:10.000 --> 2:51:12.880]  the old people they're the one that you know that they're the ones that
[2:51:12.880 --> 2:51:17.040]  destroyed our world how dare you and and the
[2:51:17.040 --> 2:51:21.280]  all the um all the pressure all the propaganda
[2:51:21.280 --> 2:51:25.600]  is to demonize old people and you know what do we need old people for
[2:51:25.600 --> 2:51:28.240]  you know they're no use anymore this is the whole
[2:51:28.240 --> 2:51:33.280]  propaganda narrative and and now they've got their opportunity
[2:51:33.280 --> 2:51:39.280]  and i'd say this to any younger people that think old people don't matter
[2:51:39.280 --> 2:51:43.920]  um they had a decades and decades and decades and decades and decades of
[2:51:43.920 --> 2:51:48.240]  experience they've been there done it got the t-shirt
[2:51:48.240 --> 2:51:52.640]  and the jacket and um maybe there's something you might be
[2:51:52.640 --> 2:51:56.400]  able to learn from them instead of demonizing them
[2:51:56.400 --> 2:52:00.160]  because um if you listen to the older people
[2:52:00.160 --> 2:52:04.720]  you might not be scammed in the way you are being scammed currently
[2:52:04.720 --> 2:52:08.640]  to um push for the very happenings the very
[2:52:08.640 --> 2:52:13.600]  policy changes the very society that is going to take another reason they want
[2:52:13.600 --> 2:52:16.400]  to get rid of the old people is they didn't grow up under this
[2:52:16.400 --> 2:52:19.760]  and they want to be able just to erase the past and now with all the ai
[2:52:19.760 --> 2:52:24.320]  censorship they can actually go in and digitally erase the past
[2:52:24.320 --> 2:52:28.080]  yeah they don't want young people and old people
[2:52:28.080 --> 2:52:34.160]  interacting because of the experience uh that older people have
[2:52:34.160 --> 2:52:38.720]  older people knew the world before it became what it is
[2:52:38.720 --> 2:52:42.800]  younger people now being born into it this is all they've ever known this is
[2:52:42.800 --> 2:52:46.640]  their real this is their normal whereas to older people it's not
[2:52:46.640 --> 2:52:50.960]  we have the we have the um the radar to see
[2:52:50.960 --> 2:52:54.720]  what a phenomenal transformation has taken place
[2:52:54.720 --> 2:52:58.720]  and what freedom what there was before and isn't now
[2:52:58.720 --> 2:53:03.520]  people need to listen to old people and um and they might learn something
[2:53:03.520 --> 2:53:07.920]  that's right old people need to get very vocal and very active of all of us
[2:53:07.920 --> 2:53:11.760]  yes exactly just speaking out there's this
[2:53:11.760 --> 2:53:16.000]  this is phrase there's no fool like an old fool and that is true
[2:53:16.000 --> 2:53:19.200]  you know if you've lived 70 80 years and learn nothing
[2:53:19.200 --> 2:53:23.360]  that's true but there's vast numbers of people of that age
[2:53:23.360 --> 2:53:28.480]  who have learned something and have experience that that needs to be uh
[2:53:28.480 --> 2:53:34.880]  listened to and not just waved away with an arrogant wave of the hand
[2:53:34.880 --> 2:53:39.120]  which is what's happening to so many old people now and my grandparents were all
[2:53:39.120 --> 2:53:42.880]  so incredibly smart let's go ahead by matters
[2:53:42.880 --> 2:53:46.400]  all life matters no matter what its color is
[2:53:46.400 --> 2:53:50.560]  and no matter what its age is that's something that's um
[2:53:50.560 --> 2:53:55.200]  maybe we could learn and realize we're all part of one family no matter what our
[2:53:55.200 --> 2:53:58.400]  age no matter what our color no matter what our background
[2:53:58.400 --> 2:54:01.680]  and if we did that then we could come together in unity
[2:54:01.680 --> 2:54:05.680]  instead of being divided and ruled so the few can control the many
[2:54:05.680 --> 2:54:09.840]  because the many are at war with each other everyone take action
[2:54:09.840 --> 2:54:15.040]  info wars.com davidike.com iconic.com you're the only way this gets out and
[2:54:15.040 --> 2:54:17.520]  you're doing a great job get announced we salute you and thank you

[2:54:46.960 --> 2:54:51.280]  globalist onslaught but we have come up with a new product
[2:54:51.280 --> 2:54:55.440]  over a year in development that is amazing
[2:54:55.440 --> 2:54:59.680]  the only organic hand sanitizer on the market
[2:54:59.680 --> 2:55:05.360]  with organic essential oils on top of it and there's another innovation
[2:55:05.360 --> 2:55:09.920]  it's the spray cap it doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick
[2:55:09.920 --> 2:55:14.240]  gross goo but it's high quality it aerosolizes it
[2:55:14.240 --> 2:55:18.240]  in a really great way i like to put it on my hands rub a little bit on my face
[2:55:18.240 --> 2:55:21.920]  it's got organic alcohol in it so spray it around your eyes but i just
[2:55:21.920 --> 2:55:25.520]  love it personally it's something that's a moisturizer as well
[2:55:25.520 --> 2:55:28.880]  show this is a real innovation i don't know why others didn't think of coming
[2:55:28.880 --> 2:55:32.720]  out with a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it so it
[2:55:32.720 --> 2:55:36.960]  doesn't dry you out smells great it's so refreshing
[2:55:36.960 --> 2:55:39.840]  this is a big winner
[2:55:45.520 --> 2:55:50.800]  there's a new twilight zone episode that's premiering here in about 20 seconds

[2:56:08.720 --> 2:56:13.600]  dot com say chinese virus dot com exercise the first amendment or lose it
[2:56:13.600 --> 2:56:16.640]  i'll see you in san antonio in about an hour and a half here is the new special
[2:56:16.640 --> 2:56:29.440]  report
[2:56:29.440 --> 2:56:33.680]  imagine you live on a planet
[2:56:33.680 --> 2:56:38.560]  where the governments of the world are openly telling you that you are
[2:56:38.560 --> 2:56:43.760]  non-essential obsolete imagine living on that planet
[2:56:43.760 --> 2:56:48.000]  in the year 2020 that major world leaders
[2:56:48.000 --> 2:56:52.720]  in places like israel and sweden are proposing
[2:56:52.720 --> 2:56:57.920]  everyone being planted with a microchip and be tracked by the state
[2:56:57.920 --> 2:57:04.400]  imagine living in a world where the third world population is already
[2:57:04.400 --> 2:57:08.240]  starving to death and where the general public has been locked in their homes
[2:57:08.240 --> 2:57:11.840]  for at least two months and the people are being told
[2:57:11.840 --> 2:57:17.440]  that now robot drones and robot dogs are going to be enforcers
[2:57:17.440 --> 2:57:20.800]  and make sure they follow the new rules and that
[2:57:20.800 --> 2:57:24.720]  things are never going back to the way they were
[2:57:24.720 --> 2:57:30.480]  imagine that at first you were told it's only two weeks to cut the curve of
[2:57:30.480 --> 2:57:34.560]  two million projected dead in america and then it turns out that that was all
[2:57:34.560 --> 2:57:38.560]  completely exaggerated at least 30 times
[2:57:38.560 --> 2:57:43.200]  and then imagined that it turns out it's on a twilight zone episode
[2:57:43.200 --> 2:57:48.960]  but it's the real world in 2020 and that the man leading the initiative for the
[2:57:48.960 --> 2:57:53.680]  united nations bill gates is openly obsessed with
[2:57:53.680 --> 2:57:59.040]  population reduction and these openly said that vaccines will
[2:57:59.040 --> 2:58:03.280]  contribute to depopulating the world we see a lot of things
[2:58:03.280 --> 2:58:06.960]  that are going very well things like producing childhood death
[2:58:06.960 --> 2:58:11.440]  and things like producing childhood death and he even admits
[2:58:11.440 --> 2:58:15.360]  in 2020 that there are going to be 700,000 people that get sick
[2:58:15.360 --> 2:58:20.720]  or who die from the vaccine we have you know one in 10,000
[2:58:20.720 --> 2:58:26.560]  side effects that's you know way more 700,000
[2:58:26.560 --> 2:58:30.800]  you know people who will suffer from that but nevertheless life won't
[2:58:30.800 --> 2:58:34.640]  ever return to normal but if you want to be able to go outside
[2:58:34.640 --> 2:58:38.960]  you're going to be forced to take this shot and then of course now they're
[2:58:38.960 --> 2:58:42.480]  announcing it's going to be hundreds of shots and
[2:58:42.480 --> 2:58:46.720]  it's worse than just the ship now being openly pushed
[2:58:46.720 --> 2:58:49.840]  no now they're saying they have a special vaccine for you called a
[2:58:49.840 --> 2:58:54.800]  dna vaccine that goes into the nucleus of your cell
[2:58:54.800 --> 2:58:59.680]  and reprograms it and in the rat studies and other studies
[2:58:59.680 --> 2:59:04.000]  it causes all sorts of mutations and cancer
[2:59:04.000 --> 2:59:08.080]  but you don't have to imagine it it's the real world in 2020
[2:59:08.080 --> 2:59:13.920]  and it's what you and I and all of us face a nightmare dystopia that's been
[2:59:13.920 --> 2:59:18.240]  prepared and tested on third world populations and on
[2:59:18.240 --> 2:59:21.600]  the victims of the communist chinese regime that's now
[2:59:21.600 --> 2:59:25.920]  leaving beta and going into full operations
[2:59:25.920 --> 2:59:30.000]  you see the chip is meant to track you and control you and keep you
[2:59:30.000 --> 2:59:35.120]  locked down that's just the beginning the scientific
[2:59:35.120 --> 2:59:39.040]  dictatorship wants the president to be able to put in your body
[2:59:39.040 --> 2:59:45.040]  whatever they want whenever they want and have you not be able to challenge it
[2:59:45.040 --> 2:59:48.640]  and speak out against it and in bill gates his own words
[2:59:48.640 --> 2:59:51.920]  they want liability protection for these new
[2:59:51.920 --> 2:59:56.960]  so-called vaccines be introduced in the body for more than 20 years they've
[2:59:56.960 --> 3:00:02.320]  developed and tested vaccines that actually go into parts of the brain
[3:00:02.320 --> 3:00:07.200]  and carry out a high-tech lobotomy to eat certain nerve-ending receptor sites
[3:00:07.200 --> 3:00:11.600]  associated with spiritual experiences and high brainwaves
[3:00:11.600 --> 3:00:14.960]  those are the same receptor sites that your body naturally produces
[3:00:14.960 --> 3:00:20.080]  endorphins when you do a good job or when that promotion at work or
[3:00:20.080 --> 3:00:23.680]  end up finding the woman or man of your dreams
[3:00:23.680 --> 3:00:27.120]  these are literally behavioral vaccines that reprogram
[3:00:27.120 --> 3:00:31.280]  the way our brains work by destroying parts of our mind
[3:00:31.280 --> 3:00:35.840]  and they're being pushed as anti-stress and anti-drug addiction vaccines
[3:00:35.840 --> 3:00:39.760]  yes you won't want alcohol or heroin or nicotine ever again
[3:00:39.760 --> 3:00:43.360]  because those receptor sites would have been destroyed but those receptor sites
[3:00:43.360 --> 3:00:46.560]  were there for a reason they were picking up natural chemicals
[3:00:46.560 --> 3:00:50.880]  endorphins that your body produces when it sees you doing
[3:00:50.880 --> 3:00:55.200]  the right thing but you see the globalists know that
[3:00:55.200 --> 3:00:59.200]  when we have a conscience and we feel good and the universe that
[3:00:59.200 --> 3:01:05.520]  god created that programmed us rewards us with those spiritual experiences that
[3:01:05.520 --> 3:01:09.040]  we don't want the new world order we don't want their fault system we don't
[3:01:09.040 --> 3:01:13.040]  want their materialistic control grid and so that's why they want to literally
[3:01:13.040 --> 3:01:16.240]  burn that out of our brains so we will become
[3:01:16.240 --> 3:01:21.200]  psychotic automatons like they are. Benjamin Netanyahu the Israeli prime
[3:01:21.200 --> 3:01:25.120]  minister is proposing microchips for all the children in Israel
[3:01:25.120 --> 3:01:28.080]  because after all all your cars in Israel are already
[3:01:28.080 --> 3:01:31.600]  tracked by the Israeli intelligence agencies for your safety
[3:01:31.600 --> 3:01:35.600]  so why shouldn't the people all be tracked as well
[3:01:35.600 --> 3:01:39.200]  Netanyahu is doing that because this is part of a larger globalist agenda
[3:01:39.200 --> 3:01:42.720]  and Netanyahu is on the verge of being removed from office because of
[3:01:42.720 --> 3:01:46.480]  corruption charges he is a compromised blackmailed
[3:01:46.480 --> 3:01:50.480]  lame duck but regardless of the reasons he's personally doing it
[3:01:50.480 --> 3:01:55.840]  we all know at a common sense level that this is beyond a science fiction
[3:01:55.840 --> 3:01:59.600]  nightmare novel and must absolutely be opposed
[3:01:59.600 --> 3:02:02.640]  it's not that we have something to hide or that we've done something wrong
[3:02:02.640 --> 3:02:05.920]  we know that powerful corporations and governments from the beginning of the
[3:02:05.920 --> 3:02:09.600]  internet age have been spying on the public have been manipulating the
[3:02:09.600 --> 3:02:13.360]  public and have been twisting information and choices
[3:02:13.360 --> 3:02:17.840]  so the public is not informed we see massive censorship taking place
[3:02:17.840 --> 3:02:21.840]  not just of info wars now but of major journalists and doctors
[3:02:21.840 --> 3:02:25.440]  and famous virologists that are coming out and pointing out
[3:02:25.440 --> 3:02:30.080]  that COVID-19 is not even that deadly and that all the regular deaths
[3:02:30.080 --> 3:02:33.840]  from flues and the cold and heart attacks and cancers
[3:02:33.840 --> 3:02:39.440]  are being put in the COVID-19 column even
[3:02:39.440 --> 3:02:42.720]  Fauci's own team admits that that's the case
[3:02:42.720 --> 3:02:46.960]  but if you pointed out you get banned so we're not just seeing the rollout of
[3:02:46.960 --> 3:02:50.560]  implantable microchips and forced high-tech deadly
[3:02:50.560 --> 3:02:54.560]  inoculations that reprogram our bodies that's what cancer does
[3:02:54.560 --> 3:02:57.840]  we're now seeing a total control grid of AI
[3:02:57.840 --> 3:03:00.960]  going and even censoring what people can send on their own
[3:03:00.960 --> 3:03:05.680]  private text messages the globalists know that their whole program has been
[3:03:05.680 --> 3:03:07.920]  exposed they know that they're in trouble
[3:03:07.920 --> 3:03:11.760]  they know the UN's own World Health Organization group
[3:03:11.760 --> 3:03:16.080]  last December met for a two-day conference and admitted
[3:03:16.080 --> 3:03:19.360]  that vaccines are hurting people and they're not being properly tested
[3:03:19.360 --> 3:03:22.800]  and that there's a cover-up and that the doctors who are the front line
[3:03:22.800 --> 3:03:26.400]  have become quote wobbly and don't believe in them
[3:03:26.400 --> 3:03:31.360]  so instead of backing off and admitting to decades and decades of abuse and
[3:03:31.360 --> 3:03:36.080]  secret payout organizations that indemnify
[3:03:36.080 --> 3:03:40.560]  the vaccine makers in big pharma they're doubling and quadrupling down
[3:03:40.560 --> 3:03:44.480]  and announcing you don't leave your house you don't have a job
[3:03:44.480 --> 3:03:50.080]  you don't travel you don't live until you accept in your body
[3:03:50.080 --> 3:03:54.080]  whatever we want to put in it oh and by the way there's liability protection
[3:03:54.080 --> 3:03:57.200]  for those companies so they can hurt you and get away with it
[3:03:57.200 --> 3:04:00.720]  and then if you try to complain about it online we will ban your internet
[3:04:00.720 --> 3:04:03.520]  identity and not even let you communicate with other humans
[3:04:03.520 --> 3:04:06.720]  so just like that we're inside the new world order just like that
[3:04:06.720 --> 3:04:10.000]  we're inside revelations just like that we're inside of dystopia
[3:04:10.000 --> 3:04:13.680]  and they are testing and tracking and seeing how much we will put up with
[3:04:13.680 --> 3:04:17.040]  that's why they sycophantically set up there on the news and say you're a hero
[3:04:17.040 --> 3:04:20.080]  when you wear the mask you're a hero when you don't go out
[3:04:20.080 --> 3:04:24.080]  you're a hero in this new paradigm and you're the leaders you've done such a
[3:04:24.080 --> 3:04:27.760]  good job and hollywood says it's permanent now to save the earth
[3:04:27.760 --> 3:04:31.600]  to lower our carbon footprint and this is the new green deal the post
[3:04:31.600 --> 3:04:36.800]  human era is here by a bunch of selfish rich billionaires with huge estates
[3:04:36.800 --> 3:04:41.040]  and private jets telling you you can't have a car go on vacation
[3:04:41.040 --> 3:04:44.800]  this is a giant authoritarian power grab by you genesis
[3:04:44.800 --> 3:04:48.400]  i've been aware of their operation for decades i've made films i've written
[3:04:48.400 --> 3:04:52.720]  books i've exposed them in their own words but now it's not all beta test it's
[3:04:52.720 --> 3:04:56.160]  not all theoretical now they're going operation
[3:04:56.160 --> 3:04:59.600]  when it's you and your family and you can decide to have stock home syndrome
[3:04:59.600 --> 3:05:03.840]  and love your abusers and lie to yourself or you can decide to have the power
[3:05:03.840 --> 3:05:08.080]  that god gave you to start speaking out to start saying no and to start
[3:05:08.080 --> 3:05:11.520]  researching all this information and educating others
[3:05:11.520 --> 3:05:15.040]  the choice is now out in the open
[3:05:15.120 --> 3:05:18.560]  decide whether you want to have a pro-human future
[3:05:18.560 --> 3:05:22.240]  or whether you're going to allow these anti-human monsters to take control of
[3:05:22.240 --> 3:05:25.840]  human destiny and the future of all our lives
[3:05:25.840 --> 3:05:29.040]  the good news is for those of you in denial you're not going to have to
[3:05:29.040 --> 3:05:32.640]  wait for the dystopia anymore it's going to come very very quickly
[3:05:32.640 --> 3:05:37.840]  and you're going to find the compliance with this
[3:05:37.840 --> 3:05:58.640]  what are champions made of here's a man who can show you
[3:05:58.640 --> 3:06:08.720]  i
[3:06:17.120 --> 3:06:14.720]  il
[3:06:18.160 --> 3:06:20.000]  calm is simply the best
[3:06:20.000 --> 3:06:41.640]  I don't like coming to you every day on the radio and TV stations that you watch and listen
[3:06:41.640 --> 3:06:45.800]  to a song and telling you all these horrible things, but you notice almost everything we've
[3:06:45.800 --> 3:06:52.400]  talked about horrible has come true. We were warning everybody to try to stop it. It's like
[3:06:52.400 --> 3:06:56.160]  telling somebody if you've got a pool, put a fence around it, if you have little kids,
[3:06:56.160 --> 3:07:00.360]  because even if they're good swimmers, they can hit their head and drown. People don't listen,
[3:07:00.360 --> 3:07:04.200]  they go out and their kids dead in the pool. Well, ladies and gentlemen, this is the death
[3:07:04.200 --> 3:07:09.600]  of the third world and the collapse of the first world. And this is 21st century warfare carried
[3:07:09.600 --> 3:07:14.960]  out by the globalist and they admit they've orchestrated it. They admit it's good to save
[3:07:14.960 --> 3:07:19.280]  the earth and they're teaching us to be more frugal and they want to make us poor so they can
[3:07:19.280 --> 3:07:25.400]  dictate our surrender to this post-human technocracy. I know all this sounds insane when I was
[3:07:25.400 --> 3:07:31.240]  talking about it 25 years ago, but now it's public because it's their operations manual. I wish this
[3:07:31.240 --> 3:07:36.080]  wasn't the case, but there really are evil psychopaths in control of most major institutions
[3:07:36.080 --> 3:08:01.560]  that we've got to stop them. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. You're listening to the Alex
[3:08:01.560 --> 3:08:13.800]  Jones show. And now your host, Gerald Salante. Hello, hello, great to be on the Alex Jones show.
[3:08:13.800 --> 3:08:29.080]  Here we are. So sad what's going on. To think, in just a few months, they've sapped joy out of
[3:08:29.080 --> 3:08:37.880]  life. I shouldn't be smiling. I might get arrested. They sapped joy out of life and they've come up
[3:08:37.880 --> 3:08:47.640]  with their new abnormal. We're supposed to behave like these freaks that are freaks. That's their
[3:08:47.640 --> 3:08:54.960]  normal is to be a freak. The politicians, polytics, many ticks suck in the life out of us right in
[3:08:54.960 --> 3:09:06.840]  front of our eyes. And most people believe it. It's so dark. And what's going on? They just, again,
[3:09:06.840 --> 3:09:12.840]  they've sapped the joy out of life. You can't make this up. Because that's all they're doing is
[3:09:12.840 --> 3:09:19.000]  they're making it up. You know, we have the Trends Journal. It's a weekly magazine. And we're
[3:09:19.000 --> 3:09:25.600]  finishing this issue. It goes out tomorrow. And I'm writing about all the lockdowns that are going
[3:09:25.600 --> 3:09:36.160]  on. And now they're opening them up. And they're making it up. There's no scientific data for
[3:09:36.160 --> 3:09:44.920]  what they're doing. It's a science fiction movie. Right in front of our eyes. Oh, in this state,
[3:09:44.920 --> 3:09:55.520]  we're going to say 50% occupancy. Well, no, we're going to say 25% occupancy. We're going to call
[3:09:55.520 --> 3:10:03.160]  like that little gruesome Newsom over there and the other Daddy's Boy Cuomo over here. We're going
[3:10:03.160 --> 3:10:11.240]  to tell you what businesses are essential and who isn't. So now in California, they opened up some
[3:10:11.240 --> 3:10:18.880]  businesses, but only curbside service. And among them, florists. Oh, florists, they're essential
[3:10:18.880 --> 3:10:27.880]  businesses. What is Newsom's family in the flower business? And in a lot of states, New York
[3:10:27.880 --> 3:10:34.800]  included, can't go to bars, can't go to restaurants and have a good time. But you could buy all the
[3:10:34.800 --> 3:10:41.920]  bourgeois from the stores. That's an essential business. These are the same light low life pieces
[3:10:41.920 --> 3:10:53.240]  of garbage crap from that political family that gave us prohibition in the 1920s, roaring 20s to
[3:10:53.240 --> 3:10:59.760]  be prohibition. Then the depression happens. Let's get rid of prohibition. You know, we'll do with
[3:10:59.760 --> 3:11:07.120]  politicians. Poly ticks will suck the life out of you will suck taxes from you. We have a great
[3:11:07.120 --> 3:11:13.760]  depression, but now we're going to lift prohibition. And we're going to make it okay to drink. Great.
[3:11:15.160 --> 3:11:23.960]  And we're going to tax the hell out of you. We'll cost you $10. She cost you $2. But we got all
[3:11:23.960 --> 3:11:31.400]  these different taxes on there. So we're poly ticks. We suck it out of you. So we don't have to work.
[3:11:32.120 --> 3:11:37.720]  We don't have to worry about losing our jobs, paying for our health care, rent our mortgages. Oh,
[3:11:37.720 --> 3:11:44.120]  our retirement. We got the best. We're poly ticks. So we steal your money in the name of taxes. And
[3:11:44.120 --> 3:11:51.680]  that's what they've done over here in New York and other states. So buying booze is an essential
[3:11:51.680 --> 3:12:00.840]  business. I'm mentioning this because they're opening up bit by bit and piece by piece. As I
[3:12:00.840 --> 3:12:11.960]  well said on David's night show on Info Wars over a year ago, March, a year ago, this last March,
[3:12:11.960 --> 3:12:21.880]  we're going into the greatest depression. There's a slowdown going on globally. I only put out the
[3:12:21.880 --> 3:12:28.240]  numbers and the facts. There was a recession down there in Mexico. Oh, and how about that place
[3:12:28.240 --> 3:12:33.280]  over there called Germany? Oh, yeah, one of the biggest industrial centers in the world,
[3:12:33.280 --> 3:12:37.960]  the highest quality product of industrialization. Oh, they were going into recession, too,
[3:12:37.960 --> 3:12:47.000]  as was the Eurozone. Now, opening up businesses bit by bit and piece by piece, and having these
[3:12:47.000 --> 3:12:53.760]  political freaks make up these laws. Like you got this jerk over here in Ocean City, New Jersey.
[3:12:53.760 --> 3:13:02.760]  I could go surfing and this and that. But you can't lie on the beach. Other places you can't
[3:13:02.760 --> 3:13:14.520]  walk on the boardwalk. Hey, stupid moron imbecile jerk. Low life piece of garbage. Governor this,
[3:13:14.520 --> 3:13:36.080]  mayor that. Controller, you know, who or whatever. Did you ever hear of vitamin D? Don't be. Jerk. One
[3:13:36.080 --> 3:13:46.520]  study coming out after another. This is not a conspiracy theory. Have vitamin D helps prevent
[3:13:46.520 --> 3:14:00.600]  diseases, including COVID-19. Hey, how about that place called Haiti? Oh, yeah, one of the
[3:14:00.600 --> 3:14:07.680]  highest living standards in the world, huh? Yeah, I'm saying that facetiously. Do they have a COVID
[3:14:07.680 --> 3:14:22.600]  epidemic? How about Cambodia? No, hardly anybody dead over there, either. Couldn't like being out
[3:14:22.600 --> 3:14:28.760]  there in the sunlight is good for you, huh? Now, we're going to be morons. We're imbecile,
[3:14:28.760 --> 3:14:37.960]  arrogant jerks. Poly ticks. I tell people Google up the definition of politician, someone who's
[3:14:37.960 --> 3:14:43.360]  manipulated and deviates typically to gain advancement in an organization. Morons imbeciles,
[3:14:43.360 --> 3:14:49.280]  the people you ate in high school and college that wanted to be class president. The way
[3:14:49.280 --> 3:14:56.120]  they're opening up this economy is only going to drag it down. The equity markets have nothing to
[3:14:56.120 --> 3:15:03.840]  do with the real world. You saw the numbers coming out last week on unemployment, and then the
[3:15:03.840 --> 3:15:10.160]  Labor Department admitted, the Labor Department admitted that that number of 14.5% unemployment
[3:15:10.160 --> 3:15:22.520]  is off. It's more like 20%. Hey, what was it during the Great Depression? 25%. The greatest
[3:15:22.520 --> 3:15:31.400]  oppression has just begun. It's time to prepare for the future. They're leading us into hell,
[3:15:31.400 --> 3:15:44.120]  right in front of our eyes. You better start getting in the best shape you can, physically,
[3:15:44.120 --> 3:15:51.080]  spiritually, emotionally. And on the physical end, of course, Info Wars stores have some great
[3:15:51.080 --> 3:16:01.440]  products. And on preparing for the future, Trends Journal brings you their history before it
[3:16:01.440 --> 3:16:11.880]  happens. So, Info Wars, Trends Journal, be prepared. We're going into a crisis beyond the
[3:16:11.880 --> 3:16:21.800]  imagination of the wildest dream. And if you don't believe in a wildest dream, let's go back three
[3:16:21.800 --> 3:16:29.480]  months ago, and the COVID crisis began. The first thing people did was go out and buy toilet paper.
[3:16:29.480 --> 3:16:37.520]  That's how bad it is. You'd be back in just a few. I was talking to my wife tonight, and I was
[3:16:37.520 --> 3:16:43.680]  saying, our economy slowing down and shutting down is like shooting a deer, and it runs 100
[3:16:43.680 --> 3:16:48.800]  yards before it knows it's been shot, and then it finally dies. She said, well, yeah, when I grew
[3:16:48.800 --> 3:16:53.520]  in Omaha, Nebraska, one time there was an argument in the street, and another man shot another man
[3:16:53.520 --> 3:16:58.880]  in the head, and the man that got shot in the head had blood pouring out a huge hole. He was
[3:16:58.880 --> 3:17:03.640]  holding it. He walked around gibbering, talking nonsense for about 60 seconds, and then just
[3:17:03.640 --> 3:17:09.480]  fell over dead. Well, that's what's going to happen with our economy. It is in cardiac arrest.
[3:17:09.480 --> 3:17:15.160]  This has been done by design, and the UN, the Chi Coms, the mainstream media orchestrated it,
[3:17:15.160 --> 3:17:20.360]  hyped it, and tried to keep the economy closed. So, remember, the depression that's coming and the
[3:17:20.360 --> 3:17:27.400]  third world collapse is all on the UN, on Bill and Melinda Gates, on Obama, on Hillary, on Biden,
[3:17:27.400 --> 3:17:32.360]  on the Democrats. We tried to stop it. We tried to fight it, but you guys said you wanted to wreck
[3:17:32.360 --> 3:17:37.720]  America and the world, and now you've done it. Congratulations. Feudalism in the ancient world
[3:17:37.720 --> 3:17:43.240]  from Asia to Europe, from Africa to Latin America, was the most common form of government. You had
[3:17:43.240 --> 3:17:48.680]  a ruling class, the nobility, the king and queen sitting on top of it, and the rest of the public
[3:17:48.680 --> 3:17:55.560]  were kept at a subsistence, starving level for control. In fact, in most cultures, they called
[3:17:55.560 --> 3:18:01.000]  the peasants the little people because they were usually a foot or more shorter than the lords
[3:18:01.000 --> 3:18:07.480]  and ladies because they kept them again at a starving level. They were so busy trying to survive,
[3:18:07.480 --> 3:18:12.200]  they would never try to challenge the entrenched elite. Well, now all the big Google owners and
[3:18:12.200 --> 3:18:17.000]  the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds, the Jeff Bezos is the world. They're sitting back on their
[3:18:17.000 --> 3:18:23.640]  giant estates with their jet helicopters and private jets living the life, laughing at you,
[3:18:23.640 --> 3:18:29.320]  shut down, going bankrupt in the third world, starving to death. Their religion is power and
[3:18:29.320 --> 3:18:35.000]  control, and they are pressing that advantage against us. We must break free from these monsters.
[3:18:38.920 --> 3:18:41.880]  Please remember that we have a lot of great products that have been out of stock, back in
[3:18:41.880 --> 3:18:45.480]  stock, like krill oil. We have the ultimate krill oil. If you don't know the benefits of krill oil,

[3:19:17.240 --> 3:19:21.080]  And we're already talking to our suppliers and some of them are saying we may not take orders
[3:19:21.080 --> 3:19:25.560]  in a few months. I may not ever be able to get products again. Things are collapsing so bad,
[3:19:25.560 --> 3:19:30.520]  folks. This is total depression. The infrastructure is going down. Get the products while you still can.
[3:19:30.520 --> 3:19:44.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:19:44.040 --> 3:20:09.480]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show with Gerald Salente.
[3:20:14.360 --> 3:20:25.240]  Alex Jones show. I was talking about the freaks in charge. And then there's the media
[3:20:27.080 --> 3:20:35.160]  who really started hyping this COVID-19. We did a story back on January 28th in the
[3:20:35.160 --> 3:20:43.640]  Trends Journal. The cover read coronavirus. 106 dead in China. And we put 1.4 billion still alive.
[3:20:45.240 --> 3:20:52.600]  So it was the media that hyped this and we showed how Jeff Zucker with the CNN, the guy that runs
[3:20:52.600 --> 3:20:58.200]  the show, told his staff to keep promoting it, keep pumping it. And then there's the toilet paper
[3:20:58.200 --> 3:21:03.400]  record, the New York Times. You see all these marks on the paper? That's how I read. I mark up
[3:21:03.400 --> 3:21:10.600]  important points and stories. This story last week, virus batters some areas.
[3:21:11.960 --> 3:21:19.320]  Why does it spare others? Research is hunting for patterns to explain wide variations in infection
[3:21:19.320 --> 3:21:27.960]  rate. The Dominican Republic has reported nearly 7,600 cases of the virus. Just across the border,
[3:21:27.960 --> 3:21:42.280]  Haiti has about 85. Okay. Haiti has about 85. 15 dead as we speak. You can't get poorer than Haiti,
[3:21:42.280 --> 3:21:47.000]  right? And again, they're making this point because they're locking us down.
[3:21:47.000 --> 3:21:58.600]  And sun is good for you. The vitamin D facts are there. But here's how also the toilet paper
[3:21:58.600 --> 3:22:03.320]  record, they call themselves the paper record, but this thing's only good for one thing. It may
[3:22:03.320 --> 3:22:09.960]  be the next crisis. People will run out and get the New York Times rather than those other toilet
[3:22:09.960 --> 3:22:18.920]  papers. Many developing nations with hot climates and young populations have escaped the worst,
[3:22:20.200 --> 3:22:27.880]  suggesting that the temperatures and demographics could be factors. But countries like Peru,
[3:22:27.880 --> 3:22:42.360]  Indonesia, and Brazil, tropical countries in the throes of growing epidemics throw cold water
[3:22:42.360 --> 3:22:56.680]  on that idea. Throw cold water on that idea. Brazil. Let's see. Brazil has about 212 million
[3:22:56.680 --> 3:23:11.400]  people, 212 million people. They have the grand total of 11,207 deaths as of now.
[3:23:12.920 --> 3:23:19.320]  That's no percentage at all. How many people got killed in those Brazilian slums yesterday or for
[3:23:19.320 --> 3:23:30.200]  the year so far? How about the other poverty issues and other illnesses affecting probably tens
[3:23:30.200 --> 3:23:38.920]  of millions of Brazilians? We won't say that, Solenti, because we're the toilet paper of record,
[3:23:38.920 --> 3:23:51.880]  the New York slime. Oh, and what other did they mention? Peru. Peru. 33 million people,
[3:23:54.440 --> 3:24:04.680]  7,887 deaths out of 30 million people with 33 million.
[3:24:04.680 --> 3:24:13.080]  And how about the poverty issues over there in Peru? How about the other things that are bringing
[3:24:13.080 --> 3:24:18.600]  people down? And like maybe they're doing what they're doing in the United States,
[3:24:20.040 --> 3:24:29.080]  and I'm not making this up. Matter of fact, they tried to make fun of it and call it a conspiracy
[3:24:29.080 --> 3:24:35.480]  theory as this clown that America loves so much, the guy that plays the greatest health expert
[3:24:35.480 --> 3:24:42.360]  in the world, this guy Fauci. Fauci means jaw in Italian. And all this little boy is doing is jaw
[3:24:42.360 --> 3:24:55.000]  boning that Fauci jaw. Yeah. He made fun of this Dr. Jensen from Michigan, who's noted that the
[3:24:55.000 --> 3:25:04.920]  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have added, quote, presumed cause of death,
[3:25:05.800 --> 3:25:09.720]  even if the diagnosis is not confirmed by a test.
[3:25:17.000 --> 3:25:21.880]  Isn't that something? Presumed, we don't have to test you.
[3:25:21.880 --> 3:25:30.600]  Yeah. So going back to the numbers in Columbia, even at 11,000, how many had been tested?
[3:25:36.600 --> 3:25:41.480]  Then we go to Indonesia, they mentioned. Oh, Indonesia.
[3:25:41.480 --> 3:26:04.920]  Yeah. Indonesia. You ready? 273,526,000 deaths. They have the grand total of 911 deaths.
[3:26:04.920 --> 3:26:20.840]  That's right. 911 deaths in a country of 200 and basically 74 million people.
[3:26:20.840 --> 3:26:35.000]  Yet the toilet paper pumps this up as though it's a mystery of who's dying.
[3:26:35.000 --> 3:26:48.840]  The facts are in the numbers. The Kaiser Health Foundation came out and said between a half
[3:26:52.280 --> 3:27:00.920]  to 30% of the deaths in America are from chronically ill people from nursing homes.
[3:27:00.920 --> 3:27:09.000]  The other facts, documented facts in your trends journal, and I'm sure they've said it on
[3:27:12.200 --> 3:27:15.480]  info wars, obesity,
[3:27:18.600 --> 3:27:27.160]  diabetics, people suffering from lung disease, heart ailments, respiratory problems,
[3:27:27.160 --> 3:27:35.480]  people that are chronically ill are the ones that are going. These are facts.
[3:27:36.680 --> 3:27:42.120]  The obesity numbers are real, as are the other ones, diabetics, lung disease.
[3:27:42.680 --> 3:27:44.840]  Healthy people are in dying of this.
[3:27:44.840 --> 3:27:58.200]  In the reporting from Associated Press, they keep mentioning over and over
[3:27:59.960 --> 3:28:05.800]  that quote in their articles after they report something in the middle of it.
[3:28:07.000 --> 3:28:13.480]  For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or modest symptoms such as fever and cough
[3:28:13.480 --> 3:28:19.480]  that clear up in two or three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people
[3:28:19.480 --> 3:28:24.520]  with existing health problems, it can cause more severe life-threatening illnesses,
[3:28:25.560 --> 3:28:35.080]  including pneumonia and death. All right, that's who's dying. However,
[3:28:35.080 --> 3:28:45.720]  the economic devastation brought to the United States of America with a K in there,
[3:28:45.720 --> 3:28:55.080]  take out the C because we become the Nazi Stasi state and a combination of the Soviet Union and China
[3:28:55.080 --> 3:29:05.000]  with the loss of our freedoms, our Bill of Rights, our Constitution robbed from us.
[3:29:08.360 --> 3:29:14.120]  All the facts are there, but all they do is keep selling fear and hype,
[3:29:14.120 --> 3:29:23.800]  just like they did after 9-11, coronavirus 9-11. That was one of our other transjournal covers.
[3:29:25.720 --> 3:29:31.720]  Selling terror, and they've terrorized the people, but we're born to be free,
[3:29:32.520 --> 3:29:34.120]  and that's why we're in infowars.
[3:29:35.320 --> 3:29:40.440]  The panic that has been orchestrated by the global corporatist media and the chai comms
[3:29:40.440 --> 3:29:46.520]  is going to now trigger a worldwide depression. In fact, we're already into the worldwide
[3:29:46.520 --> 3:29:51.000]  depression and the death sentence for the third world, but it's critical to understand
[3:29:51.000 --> 3:29:57.960]  that the longer the shutdown persists, the worse it's going to be. A month of shutdown will destroy
[3:29:57.960 --> 3:30:02.600]  decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex economy. That's why we've always said it's
[3:30:02.600 --> 3:30:07.080]  important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient because the globalists want to
[3:30:07.080 --> 3:30:13.800]  make us all dependent so that we're under their control. They've admitted all of this. So remember,
[3:30:13.800 --> 3:30:19.480]  how does infowars continue years and decades in many cases to be able to predict things before
[3:30:19.480 --> 3:30:25.160]  they happen? Because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan, and yes, it's
[3:30:25.160 --> 3:30:30.280]  dystopic, and yes, it's scary, but denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times
[3:30:30.280 --> 3:30:34.760]  more scary. It's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening.
[3:30:34.760 --> 3:30:39.320]  I don't have to tell you that we are in the most important point in human history.
[3:30:39.320 --> 3:30:43.160]  The globalists have taken the gloves off and they've taken the mask off and they're like,
[3:30:43.160 --> 3:30:48.520]  yeah, you're taking implantable chips. Yeah, we're into pedophilia. Yeah, we're into world
[3:30:48.520 --> 3:30:55.160]  government. Yeah, you're obsolete. You are non-essential. We are shutting your ass down. Yeah,
[3:30:55.160 --> 3:30:59.640]  we told you don't be farmers and don't be ranchers and don't work in industry anymore.
[3:30:59.640 --> 3:31:04.200]  You're going to be the service economy. And now the globalists are telling you that there's no
[3:31:04.200 --> 3:31:09.480]  more service economy and you're obsolete. So you better bow down to them and get your universal
[3:31:09.480 --> 3:31:15.000]  pittance income so they can dictate your life. The handcuffs are going on right now.
[3:31:15.000 --> 3:31:19.800]  We have to resist and say no to the new world order. And that takes you understanding you were
[3:31:19.800 --> 3:31:25.000]  right and understanding I was right and getting in people's faces and raising the alarm now
[3:31:25.000 --> 3:31:30.920]  while you still can. Now is the time for action. Now is the time for you to shine and be the Paul

[3:32:38.120 --> 3:32:44.680]  human civilization to build up the world economy to where it is. Every economist is on record saying
[3:32:44.680 --> 3:32:49.800]  that as this economy has been shut down for two months, it is going to be a death sentence to
[3:32:49.800 --> 3:32:55.720]  the third world and a horrible nightmarish collapse for the first world and that the general public
[3:32:55.720 --> 3:33:00.680]  is going to go into deep, deep debt to the mega banks. They're not going to have medical ID cards,
[3:33:00.680 --> 3:33:07.880]  force inoculations. We are now in a giant dystopia. But a lot of people are waking up
[3:33:07.880 --> 3:33:13.880]  and there is a major backlash taking place against this tyranny. And we must all rediscover our
[3:33:13.880 --> 3:33:19.640]  bill of rights, rediscover our constitution and our backbone, and start saying no to people who
[3:33:19.640 --> 3:33:24.040]  take this moral high ground and say, shut your business down, shut your life down, it'll save
[3:33:24.040 --> 3:33:29.960]  lives. No, it's caused millions to already starve to death, tens of millions more. So the cowards
[3:33:29.960 --> 3:33:34.120]  who went along with us with your virtues signaling, you have destroyed your lives and our lives.
[3:33:34.120 --> 3:33:35.080]  Congratulations.
[3:33:35.080 --> 3:33:59.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Waging war on corruption. It's Gerald Salente.

[3:35:58.440 --> 3:36:04.680]  put your money where your heart is because you can see how they're trying to censor us.
[3:36:05.880 --> 3:36:11.640]  Again, I read to you the New York Times how they go after people make statements without facts.
[3:36:11.640 --> 3:36:24.760]  It went after that Dr. Jensen from him saying that what they were doing is putting suspected
[3:36:24.760 --> 3:36:36.600]  deaths in as COVID deaths without testing. And also they did that because when somebody dies
[3:36:36.600 --> 3:36:42.840]  of COVID in the hospital, they get more money. That's right. And I'm not making that up.
[3:36:43.400 --> 3:36:51.720]  And in fact, even USA Today did a story on that one. So we're looking here at what's going on,
[3:36:51.720 --> 3:37:00.760]  what's real and what they're telling us. And when you look at the facts, you can see how easy it is
[3:37:00.760 --> 3:37:07.960]  to send people to war based on lies because that's all they're doing again is selling us
[3:37:08.760 --> 3:37:19.240]  more and more lies. Alex Jones was saying on that piece of intro, some of the products that are
[3:37:19.240 --> 3:37:25.880]  being sold about how this economy is going down so badly. As I said, we're going into the greatest
[3:37:25.880 --> 3:37:35.400]  depression. This is going to be worse than the Great Depression. Neiman Marcus seeks bankruptcy
[3:37:35.400 --> 3:37:45.400]  protection as last week. Virus spurs bankruptcy for Canadian chain. Aldo group. That was last
[3:37:45.400 --> 3:37:55.800]  Thursday. Up to 15% of Rolls Royce jobs face acts in planned shakeup. Virgin Atlantic to slash
[3:37:55.800 --> 3:38:03.480]  a third of staff and leave Gatwick. They've been there for some 35 years. Glass door.
[3:38:05.800 --> 3:38:15.560]  Crash. They laying off 30% of their staff. Raytheon to cut costs $2 billion furlough staff.
[3:38:15.560 --> 3:38:28.120]  E.U. forecasts a sharp slide into recession. Euro weakens after Germans. Oh, that's a different
[3:38:28.120 --> 3:38:34.360]  one. I'll talk about that. German challenge on ECB stimulus. Euro zone stability falters
[3:38:35.000 --> 3:38:43.880]  under pandemic impact. One's Brussels. It's not the pandemic impact. It's the impact brought to
[3:38:43.880 --> 3:38:55.240]  us by demented politicians. By psychopaths, sociopaths and pathological liars. It's not the
[3:38:55.240 --> 3:39:05.320]  coronavirus that did this. It's the sick people in charge. Again, going back to the United States
[3:39:05.320 --> 3:39:11.320]  and going back to the other countries I was talking about, like a place like Haiti, where poverty
[3:39:11.320 --> 3:39:21.480]  is rampant and they only have 35 or 19, 19 deaths. America's suffering from obesity.
[3:39:23.480 --> 3:39:28.360]  And that's one of the major causes of death other than the elderly in nursing homes.
[3:39:29.480 --> 3:39:35.240]  42% of Americans are obese. 70% are overweight.
[3:39:35.240 --> 3:39:46.440]  And then there's smoking related diseases that are adding up to this. Again, quarantine the ill,
[3:39:47.400 --> 3:39:59.480]  free the healthy. Eurozone recovery will take three years, warns European Central Bank economists.
[3:39:59.480 --> 3:40:10.200]  Mortgage back debt under pressure as hotel owners fail to make payments. Look at the stupid freaks
[3:40:10.200 --> 3:40:15.400]  that are making up these things. Now when you get on an airplane, you have to wear a mask.
[3:40:16.200 --> 3:40:21.640]  Isn't it fun to fly already get felt up when you go to the airport and they pack you in like
[3:40:21.640 --> 3:40:30.360]  and they pack you in like sardines? Because I go back to the days of flying was fun.
[3:40:31.000 --> 3:40:40.600]  Yeah. Anyway, now you got to wear masks. Won't it be fun to eat and drink with masks and to
[3:40:40.600 --> 3:40:50.840]  socially distance? The tourism business is it's hit hard. I got to tell you, man, Trump is really
[3:40:50.840 --> 3:40:59.960]  taking a hit on this too. All them hotels that more logo and one down in DC that was doing boom
[3:40:59.960 --> 3:41:08.680]  in business. So this is hurting a lot of people up and down the line. This isn't going to come back.
[3:41:08.680 --> 3:41:21.320]  What else do we have here? Virus threats. 10 billion Euro hit to footballers value.
[3:41:21.880 --> 3:41:26.760]  These are the teams out there just like the ones in the United States. People aren't going to want
[3:41:26.760 --> 3:41:34.360]  to go to stadiums. Music industry. I musicians are struggling even in the best of time.
[3:41:34.360 --> 3:41:41.800]  And now they're out of work. And now these moron jerk imbecile low life pieces of garbage
[3:41:41.800 --> 3:41:48.680]  crap. Politicians poly ticks sucking the blood out of us make up stuff. This is from the Wall
[3:41:48.680 --> 3:41:56.040]  Street Journal. Berlin moves to re-open nations economy. And then some restaurants will be
[3:41:56.040 --> 3:42:04.520]  permitted to open by end of May. If they keep tables six and a half feet apart. Oh, yeah, great.
[3:42:04.520 --> 3:42:15.880]  Who's making up six? I say six feet. 12 inches. No, no, six and a half feet. No, no, no. All right.
[3:42:15.880 --> 3:42:27.480]  And making this crap up. You ready? Many restrictions will remain. Only people from no more than two
[3:42:27.480 --> 3:42:33.880]  separate households will be allowed to meet outside their home between now and June 5th.
[3:42:34.840 --> 3:42:42.040]  People will have to keep about six feet apart when outside. Hey, wait a minute. In America,
[3:42:42.040 --> 3:42:51.560]  in America, six feet apart. Why five feet apart? Belgium. Families and friends would be allowed
[3:42:51.560 --> 3:43:00.600]  to meet again under one roof, but only under a maximum of four guests for each home and always
[3:43:00.600 --> 3:43:13.960]  with the same people. They're making this crap up. You can't. This is a grade B movie. This is,
[3:43:14.520 --> 3:43:18.280]  yeah, they got a farmer's market out here now. And they used to be on the street. They put it
[3:43:18.280 --> 3:43:23.240]  in the parking lot across the street, the county office building. You got to give your name before
[3:43:23.240 --> 3:43:32.120]  you go there. You got to wear a mask. And you have to be six foot apart. The wind is blowing
[3:43:32.120 --> 3:43:39.160]  everywhere. Oh, you don't wear a mask mask. You can wear a bandana. You can wear
[3:43:40.760 --> 3:43:47.000]  they're making this stuff up. The wind is blowing. These masks aren't. Oh, and what some
[3:43:47.000 --> 3:43:52.440]  organizations are saying, you shouldn't be wearing masks. No, your conspiracy theorists
[3:43:52.440 --> 3:43:59.320]  will say that. They don't know what they're doing. They have destroyed our lives, destroyed joy, beauty,
[3:43:59.320 --> 3:44:06.040]  love and liberty, and they destroyed the global economy. The greatest depression has begun.
[3:44:06.600 --> 3:44:13.000]  You better prepare now. Stock up with info wards. Be prepared for the future.
[3:44:15.560 --> 3:44:21.000]  Remember, they used to make fun of Preppers and prepare for the future by subscribing to the
[3:44:21.000 --> 3:44:23.240]  Trends Journal.
