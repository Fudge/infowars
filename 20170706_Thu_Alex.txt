[00:00.000 --> 00:29.300]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:29.300 --> 00:33.200]  Today through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. We're here live. I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:33.200 --> 00:37.720]  Thank you so much for joining us. Look at the Drugs Report headline, Trump, the West
[00:37.720 --> 00:42.760]  will never be broken. And then I look at Atlantic Monthly yesterday saying white people are
[00:42.760 --> 00:50.080]  the problem and must be done away with and that the West will fall. No, we're not quoting
[00:50.080 --> 00:57.800]  Mordor or Sauron out of Lord of the Rings. We are quoting the globalists. We're quoting
[00:57.800 --> 01:04.360]  the Democratic Party. These are white people, folks, but they want to have a racial collision
[01:04.360 --> 01:10.360]  globally. They want global division. They are unbelievable. They can do the math and
[01:10.360 --> 01:17.560]  know that seven billion people aren't are not what you'd call Caucasian and say if we
[01:17.560 --> 01:23.080]  fill them full of racism and hate of the West, we can exploit them and use them as reverse
[01:23.080 --> 01:29.740]  colonization, reverse colonialism to bring down the West. That is what globalism is in
[01:29.740 --> 01:35.120]  essence with a bunch of tax exempt mega banks ruling over everybody and using internal country
[01:35.120 --> 01:40.200]  controls to have high taxes that actually destroy their competition. But Trump goes
[01:40.200 --> 01:45.440]  to Poland who's had no terror attacks, very nationalistic, very liberal generally, but
[01:45.440 --> 01:51.840]  they love Trump because they understand the message of prosperity. They love Ronald Reagan.
[01:51.840 --> 01:56.720]  They want free market and they understand that America is back. Here is Trump arriving
[01:56.720 --> 02:22.720]  in Poland last night to rock star fanfare. Here it is.
[02:22.720 --> 02:35.360]  Is the story of a people who have never lost hope, who have never been broken and who have
[02:35.360 --> 02:56.960]  never, ever forgotten who they are. You see, it's such a breath of fresh air to people
[02:56.960 --> 03:01.320]  that have been under totalitarianism that you think that the United States is actually
[03:01.320 --> 03:09.520]  being taken back from the globalist. I've also got footage of his motorcade last night
[03:09.520 --> 03:13.840]  being blocked by cheering crowds. It's even more powerful. That's coming up. Now some
[03:13.840 --> 03:20.120]  of the media saying Trump's finally turned against Russia. Now what Trump's doing going
[03:20.120 --> 03:26.240]  into a meeting tomorrow with Putin is saying a lot of strong things up front for negotiating
[03:26.240 --> 03:30.440]  strength tomorrow. Of course, Putin knows that. Just like he said, a lot of real serious
[03:30.440 --> 03:35.080]  stuff to the Chinese president before going into a meeting with him. And it is true that
[03:35.080 --> 03:39.780]  Russia is, again, on the border of Poland, on the border of Ukraine, but it's been the
[03:39.780 --> 03:44.640]  West stirring up the trouble, violating the deal that was set at the end of the Cold War
[03:44.640 --> 03:50.120]  in 1991 that we would not expand to the old Warsaw Pact and into the East, former Soviet
[03:50.120 --> 03:56.160]  satellites that they would not expand to the West. And it has been Bill Clinton to a certain
[03:56.160 --> 04:01.240]  extent, George W. Bush and Obama big time that violated those agreements. That's just
[04:01.240 --> 04:06.800]  facts. Those are agreements that were made and now they've been violated because the
[04:06.800 --> 04:11.560]  globalists don't want Russia rebuilding. Just like the globalists don't want us rebuilding.
[04:11.560 --> 04:15.880]  And Trump understands that, but he needs to get the globalists at least politically off
[04:15.880 --> 04:20.720]  his back on the surface with the public. So some saber rattling against Russia, I think
[04:20.720 --> 04:25.680]  is just that. I think Russia will know that that Trump actually wants in to Russia for
[04:25.680 --> 04:31.360]  all those resources. It'd be a match made in heaven economically. Russia has more resources
[04:31.360 --> 04:36.880]  than any geographic area. It's huge, but more than Africa, ladies and gentlemen, and a lot
[04:36.880 --> 04:41.160]  more than the United States. My time I checked, I think Russia has about four times general
[04:41.160 --> 04:47.040]  resources than the United States. So that is a big issue right there. We need economic
[04:47.040 --> 04:55.080]  development, not continued stalemates and military confrontation that only empowers
[04:55.080 --> 05:00.800]  the globalist. Big transmission straight ahead. Stay with us. President Trump's tweets have
[05:00.800 --> 05:05.720]  sent the Democrats into a tizzy again. After President Trump ripped psycho Joe and no IQ
[05:05.720 --> 05:10.560]  Mika last week, Trump got back on Twitter yesterday and posted a short video of himself
[05:10.560 --> 05:15.760]  beating up another man depicted as a CNN logo, a total classic. But the Democrats didn't
[05:15.760 --> 05:20.120]  appreciate Trump's animosity towards the fake news network CNN and are now drumming up the
[05:20.120 --> 05:24.600]  bill for impeachment based on the 25th Amendment, citing grounds that the president is mentally
[05:24.600 --> 05:29.640]  unfit to serve. Now this would require a medical examination, which may come back to bite the
[05:29.640 --> 05:33.880]  Democrats that are calling for it. You see, given a fair examination of the president's
[05:33.880 --> 05:38.320]  health, Trump will pass with flying colors. But imagine if the tables were turned and
[05:38.320 --> 05:43.600]  Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Maxine Waters, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders were
[05:43.600 --> 05:48.200]  asked to pass the same test, given the importance of their jobs. I wonder if they would still
[05:48.200 --> 05:53.720]  be pushing this bill. Something tells me they wouldn't be. For Infowars.com, this is Owen
[05:53.720 --> 05:54.720]  Schreuer.

[08:47.960 --> 08:53.160]  be live here for the next four hours as we are every weekday 11am to 3pm central. Thank
[08:53.160 --> 08:58.880]  you so much for joining us. Infowars.com is the very sort of truth, the tip of the spear
[08:58.880 --> 09:04.360]  in the fight to restore our republic and to promote western civilization values. That's
[09:04.360 --> 09:11.920]  something the media demonizes and calls racist. It just simply means free market, renaissance,
[09:11.920 --> 09:19.560]  very tolerant societies, truly egalitarian. But modern leftist systems are authoritarian
[09:19.560 --> 09:25.640]  and very, very oppressive and big corporations have weaponized social distortion, weaponized
[09:25.640 --> 09:32.160]  racial, cultural, religious and ethnic divisions to control populations. That's public. That's
[09:32.160 --> 09:39.600]  declassified. That's in the WikiLeaks. That is not debatable. And all across the world,
[09:39.600 --> 09:46.840]  people are rejecting it. Look at these headlines. Trump praises populist Poland, says West must
[09:46.840 --> 09:54.560]  defend civilization and faith. Newsweek responds by calling it racist. Bash is Trump for vowing
[09:54.560 --> 10:03.360]  to defend the West. You cannot make that up. That's a Paul Joseph Watson report quoting
[10:03.360 --> 10:09.920]  Newsweek. Now, who's really being racist here? Well, it's beyond racism. It's cultural divide.
[10:09.920 --> 10:19.600]  It's cultural manipulation. The truth is, it's Atlantic monthly just yesterday that said
[10:19.600 --> 10:26.240]  Trump can't reverse the decline of white Christian America. And they go on to say Christianity's
[10:26.240 --> 10:34.560]  going down and so are white people. And this is from an elite mainly white readership East
[10:34.560 --> 10:40.000]  Coast publication, because the elite want control. They don't want to free open society.
[10:40.000 --> 10:44.800]  So they think they can bring in massive third world minority groups, make them the majority
[10:44.800 --> 10:52.160]  and then fill them full of racial hatred using Hollywood systems of control that go and open
[10:52.160 --> 10:57.040]  old wounds and magnify it and amplify it and build the pressure and the pressure and the
[10:57.040 --> 11:04.640]  pressure so that they can get people to not want free market, not want freedom, but to
[11:04.640 --> 11:14.000]  just be racially based and then racially controlled. Amazing that they are that sickening when
[11:14.000 --> 11:20.480]  they engage in this type of behavior. Meanwhile, Sweden has had so many mass rapes and anti
[11:20.480 --> 11:27.200]  racism events put on for the Muslims that they're now banning men at them. That's right.
[11:27.200 --> 11:31.040]  Bring in the Islamists that are 99% of the rapes in Europe, according to their own numbers.
[11:31.040 --> 11:35.200]  Make Sweden the rape capital of the world. Something happened last night in Sweden.
[11:35.200 --> 11:40.000]  Boy, Trump was right. There's all these countless videos online of them gang raping women,
[11:40.000 --> 11:44.720]  men lined up 10 deep holding them down or raping them and the police do nothing because that's
[11:44.720 --> 11:48.640]  politically incorrect. Just like in England, they won't stop the kidnapping and raping
[11:48.640 --> 11:52.160]  of little girls predominantly by Muslims because that's just their culture.
[11:53.760 --> 11:59.840]  Sweden hold man free festival following spat of rapes and sex attacks that led to one event
[11:59.840 --> 12:08.240]  being canceled. That's the New York Daily News, Daily Mail. They're all reporting on it.
[12:08.240 --> 12:12.160]  Of course, they were really pointing out that it's the Muslims. You don't dare do that.
[12:12.160 --> 12:20.320]  And then Trump, he has to be dealt with. He's so racist. He's so evil. Newsweek bashed Trump
[12:20.320 --> 12:26.800]  for vowing to defend the West as they bring in weaponized Muslims. Newsweek reacted to Donald
[12:26.800 --> 12:32.800]  Trump's speech in Poland during which the president vowed to defeat Western, to defend Western
[12:32.800 --> 12:37.760]  civilization. We're going to play a clip of this in a moment. Newsweek reacted to Donald Trump's
[12:37.760 --> 12:42.880]  speech in Poland during which the president vowed to defend Western civilization by
[12:44.720 --> 12:49.200]  writing a triggering hit piece that claimed Trump didn't know what he was talking about.
[12:49.760 --> 12:54.240]  President Donald Trump just delivered a long speech in Warsaw, part Polish history lesson,
[12:54.240 --> 12:58.960]  part foreign policy address, part full-throated call to defend the West, whatever that might mean.
[13:00.080 --> 13:06.960]  You'd be forgiven for finding it a little confusing. No, Trump knows exactly what Atlantic
[13:06.960 --> 13:11.040]  Monthly and the elites have been writing for years. Trump can't reverse the decline of white
[13:11.040 --> 13:15.520]  Christian America. But see, that's for the elites to read. Because once they've got Christians out
[13:15.520 --> 13:19.840]  of the way and Western civilization out of the way, it's nothing but third world total enslavement.
[13:20.640 --> 13:24.880]  But see, the Newsweek wants to play dumb and say they don't know what that really means.
[13:25.440 --> 13:31.040]  Let's hear from the president specifically on what he said yesterday, and then let's expand on
[13:31.040 --> 13:40.480]  that. Because listen carefully, Poland, other than Serbia and Hungary and Romania, but Poland
[13:40.480 --> 13:48.240]  more than probably any other nation in Eastern Europe, has stopped the Islamic invasion over
[13:48.240 --> 13:56.080]  a hundred times. The reason Polish women have those pretty cat eyes, a lot of them, and people like
[13:56.080 --> 14:00.480]  Melania, Eastern European, is because they've got a little Asian dashed in there because that's what
[14:00.480 --> 14:10.720]  Arabs are. This is a mix between Caucasian, Black, and Asian. That's what Arabic is. That's what
[14:10.720 --> 14:18.880]  that group is. That's the crossroads of the world. And so Poland held off, Turkey didn't,
[14:20.000 --> 14:24.720]  became the seat of the Ottoman Empire. Istanbul was previously Constantinople. Everyone goes and
[14:24.720 --> 14:28.400]  looks at the beautiful churches that are mosque now and says, oh, look at the incredible Islamic
[14:28.400 --> 14:34.320]  architecture. It's Christian architecture. It's Byzantine Empire, Holy Roman Empire architecture.
[14:34.320 --> 14:41.040]  Long after Rome fell in 410 to Visigoth, Chieftain, Alaric, they moved it to the east.
[14:42.000 --> 14:47.840]  And then it fell to the Muslim invasion. The men were put to the sword. The women were sold into
[14:47.840 --> 14:56.960]  slavery. And now Erdogan is announcing a jihad to take down Europe for Islamification and has
[14:56.960 --> 15:03.360]  pledged allegiance to ISIS and al-Qaeda basically. He's no longer the loving Muslim. He's no longer
[15:03.360 --> 15:07.200]  the friendly Muslim. Suddenly they're not just having little mustaches. Suddenly everybody's
[15:07.200 --> 15:11.680]  growing beards because it's time to uncloke. They've doubled their population the last 20 years.
[15:11.680 --> 15:19.040]  It's time for jihad. We have Democratic Party operatives at Hamas meetings in the U.S. openly
[15:19.040 --> 15:26.000]  saying it's jihad on Donald Trump. It's the west that ended slavery in the west. It's the west that
[15:26.000 --> 15:30.400]  was opened to all groups. It's the west. And the hospitality of the west, our greatest strength,
[15:30.400 --> 15:36.160]  was used against us by Hollywood to focus in an exacerbate and open wounds and demonize
[15:36.160 --> 15:41.920]  problems that Christians tried to fix. When we are the best at open free societies, the average
[15:41.920 --> 15:46.880]  American thinks we're the worst. They actually think North Korea is better. Many liberals do,
[15:46.880 --> 15:50.320]  or Cuba, you know, for healthcare. They're idiots.
[15:50.320 --> 15:57.040]  So this is the takeover. If you're a cold-blooded globalist, on average, if you don't even have
[15:57.040 --> 16:01.280]  children, don't care about a future, you make a short-term deal with the giant third-world
[16:01.280 --> 16:05.840]  populations that you've already exploited and used. Now that's collapsing. Flood the west,
[16:06.480 --> 16:11.920]  drive down wages, and then fill them full of militant class envy with a nice icing of racism.
[16:11.920 --> 16:16.160]  And then when people finally see it and say, let's not do this, you jump on them and say they're
[16:16.160 --> 16:24.080]  racist. Here is President Trump to a hero's welcome in Poland. Now among the most committed members
[16:24.800 --> 16:32.400]  of the NATO Alliance, Poland has resumed its place as a leading nation of a Europe that is strong,
[16:32.960 --> 16:40.560]  whole and free. A strong Poland is a blessing to the nations of Europe, and they know that.
[16:40.560 --> 16:49.200]  A strong Europe is a blessing to the West and to the world.
[16:51.200 --> 16:58.400]  100 years after the entry of American forces into World War I, the transatlantic bond between
[16:58.400 --> 17:05.360]  the United States and Europe is as strong as ever, and maybe in many ways even stronger.
[17:05.360 --> 17:13.920]  This continent no longer confronts the specter of communism, but today we're in the West,
[17:14.640 --> 17:22.880]  and we have to say there are dire threats to our security and to our way of life.
[17:22.880 --> 17:29.840]  You see what's happening out there? They are threats. We will confront them. We will win.
[17:29.840 --> 17:37.760]  But they are threats. We will have victory. It's a spirit,
[17:37.760 --> 17:39.840]  and we have the will, the history, and the capacity.
[17:44.880 --> 17:48.160]  This seems radical to Hollywood because all it is is sanity returning.
[17:48.160 --> 17:59.280]  We urge Russia to cease its destabilizing activities in Ukraine and elsewhere,
[17:59.280 --> 18:07.280]  and in support for hostile regimes, including Syria and Iran, and to instead join the community
[18:07.280 --> 18:18.880]  of responsible nations in our fight against common enemies and in defense of civilization itself.
[18:18.880 --> 18:22.960]  That is one of the only things I've ever heard Donald Trump say that is patently not true.
[18:25.200 --> 18:30.320]  That last little part. It's been Russia on the front lines, just like Poland,
[18:30.320 --> 18:36.160]  for over 1400 years fighting Islam and holding a line. Serbia, Russia, Poland, Hungary,
[18:36.160 --> 18:40.080]  Romania, countries. That's the front line. That's where the invasion stopped,
[18:41.360 --> 18:45.440]  and then the globalists running America, as Trump knows, have been financing the Islamic
[18:45.440 --> 18:50.720]  invasion all over the world. The EU has opened up its borders, is flooding in 80% military age
[18:50.720 --> 18:57.440]  men to engage in cultural and physical jihad, and then Soros goes and overthrows Ukraine,
[18:58.560 --> 19:04.320]  starts a war with Russia, and Trump comes out and basically reverses what he said in the campaign
[19:04.320 --> 19:10.480]  and says that, you know, Russia needs to join the community and help us fight for civilization.
[19:11.360 --> 19:15.600]  That's like if Russia just won the Super Bowl of fighting Muslims and radical Muslims in
[19:15.600 --> 19:19.280]  Syrian places, and then you tell them they need to learn how to play football. And I'm not here
[19:19.280 --> 19:24.320]  to defend Russia. I'm here to defend reality. This is very cut and dry. Now, I understand he's doing
[19:24.320 --> 19:29.040]  this as a negotiation, going in with Putin tomorrow. So at a Machiavelli level, I get what
[19:29.040 --> 19:34.080]  Trump's doing. At a chess level, I get it. But Trump's strength is not playing Machiavelli.
[19:36.000 --> 19:40.480]  And it also gets his detractors, and then he's a Russian agent, folks, off his back. So he
[19:40.480 --> 19:45.200]  knows what he's doing. In fact, it's a stroke of genius politically. It's just that his real
[19:45.200 --> 19:50.080]  strength has been telling it like it is right out in the open. Now to see him engage in this
[19:50.080 --> 19:56.080]  Machiavellian left hook, it's one of the first times we've seen little BLZ bub.

[22:02.080 --> 22:06.880]  Those times may be near. Think about it, our country faces multiple terrorist threats and
[22:06.880 --> 22:11.920]  aggressions from Russia and North Korea. Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to
[22:11.920 --> 22:16.560]  looting of stores and city shutdowns. And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid
[22:16.560 --> 22:21.360]  vulnerable to long-term allergies from a single cyber attack. When the chaos from any one of
[22:21.360 --> 22:26.720]  these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.

[24:12.320 --> 24:16.000]  You know, there's all these folks that want to merge us with the Middle East.
[24:16.000 --> 24:22.880]  And they want to merge us with North Africa. But everybody's trying to get out of the Middle
[24:22.880 --> 24:27.680]  East and get out of North Africa and the populations are doubling every 20 years. Now,
[24:27.680 --> 24:32.960]  I don't want to go in there and Bill Gates them with a bunch of poison vaccines. But at the same
[24:32.960 --> 24:39.520]  time, the globalists are using those populations to absolutely create degradation. I mean, you go
[24:39.520 --> 24:45.040]  to France, you go to Italy, you go to Greece. It looks like a war zone in every town, every city.
[24:45.040 --> 24:49.760]  It is, it is a nightmare. In fact, I've shown some of this, but I really want to get the crew to
[24:49.760 --> 24:55.840]  put together a reel of videos just from lately of folks driving through the forest in France.
[24:55.840 --> 25:00.960]  And you see people suddenly like climbing like out of some movie out of the woods and dropping
[25:00.960 --> 25:05.760]  trees in front of the car and then robbing everybody. And then just pulling over whole
[25:05.760 --> 25:10.400]  groups of trucks and beating everybody up and just robbing the vehicles and driving off in them.
[25:10.400 --> 25:15.600]  And nothing's being done. I mean, why would, why would Europe do that?
[25:17.520 --> 25:24.640]  There's new video of Austria panicking and deploying armored vehicles and tens of thousands of
[25:24.640 --> 25:30.720]  troops to their border with Italy, where Muslims are marching across 6,000 a day. It's being reported
[25:30.720 --> 25:37.280]  by Austria, just at one crossing. And the Italians won't stop them. So they've put troops on the
[25:37.280 --> 25:44.720]  border and Italy is saying you need to remove them. You need to let this happen. I mean,
[25:44.720 --> 26:01.760]  a year ago, France declared a civil emergency. And the roads are under martial law. And now
[26:01.760 --> 26:08.160]  Macron is declaring martial law. He's declared martial law powers, not since the end of World
[26:08.160 --> 26:15.040]  War II of those that in power and has declared himself the God Jupiter. His presidential office
[26:15.040 --> 26:23.600]  said, I will rule like the God Jupiter. Talk about insanity, just bringing in millions,
[26:23.600 --> 26:31.040]  10 million Muslims in Europe, 10 million. I thought it was five million the last
[26:31.040 --> 26:37.840]  years. It's 10 million, according to the UN, 10 million just running around insanely.
[26:40.880 --> 26:45.680]  They're having to close outdoor events because of the mass raping. They poop in the public pools
[26:45.680 --> 26:50.080]  and no one's trying to rehabilitate them or wake them up with their saying you must adopt their
[26:50.080 --> 26:58.240]  culture. Well, why doesn't Linda Sarsour, big Democrat, big SJW, a big Soros funded lady,
[26:58.240 --> 27:03.200]  at a Hamas fundraiser, so she's fighting Trump as Jihad. Lady, why don't you go to a Muslim
[27:03.200 --> 27:07.280]  country where they don't even let women speak in public? Why don't you go put a beekeeper outfit
[27:07.280 --> 27:12.160]  on and go get your genitals cut off? You know, overseas, if you love it so much, the globalist
[27:12.160 --> 27:17.040]  headline will be, Jones wants Linda Sarsour's genitals cut off. Now, I didn't say that. I said
[27:17.040 --> 27:21.600]  they're having 5,000 plus women a year illegally having their genitals cut off in England alone,
[27:21.600 --> 27:25.600]  they've discovered. It's spreading all over the place. I'm saying if you love it so much,
[27:25.600 --> 27:34.080]  go there. Don't come here and then run around in your Halloween costumes and tell the rest of us
[27:34.080 --> 27:40.240]  that just want to be prosperous that we're the problem. You're the problem, not us. It's a culture
[27:40.240 --> 27:48.160]  issue. Let's go ahead and roll that clip of Linda Sarsour. Sisters and brothers, it's been 16, almost
[27:48.160 --> 27:56.880]  17 years since the horrific attacks of 9-11 and we still as a community find ourselves unprepared
[27:56.880 --> 28:01.760]  in so many moments. Why, sisters and brothers, why are we so unprepared? Why are we so afraid of
[28:01.760 --> 28:07.360]  this administration and the potential chaos that they will ensue in our community? And we already
[28:07.360 --> 28:12.880]  saw their potential when they come out every few weeks. Muslim ban one, Muslim ban two, Muslim ban
[28:12.880 --> 28:18.080]  three. They are relentless. They are persistent and consistent and want to see how much we as a
[28:18.080 --> 28:23.280]  community can endure and want to see who our friends are and how hard we're going to fight back
[28:23.280 --> 28:29.840]  against this administration. And I hope that we, when we stand up to those who oppress our communities,
[28:29.840 --> 28:36.160]  that Allah accepts from us that as a form of jihad, that we are struggling against tyrants and rulers
[28:36.160 --> 28:40.960]  not only abroad in the Middle East or in the other side of the world, but here in these United States
[28:40.960 --> 28:45.360]  of America where you have fascists and white supremacists and Islamophobes reigning in the
[28:45.360 --> 28:50.320]  White House. Oh, white supremacists. Well, I mean, how many are those out there? Who are they killing?
[28:50.320 --> 28:54.880]  Who are they murdering? Are those guys off buildings? That we as a Muslim community in these United
[28:54.880 --> 28:59.680]  States of America have to be perpetually outraged every single day. When I wake up in the morning
[28:59.680 --> 29:04.960]  and I remember who's sitting in the White House, I am outraged. Yeah, Linda Sarsour is totally
[29:04.960 --> 29:11.920]  fun about Zoras. She ran the Women's March in D.C. This country is not normal. So do not ever be
[29:12.800 --> 29:18.480]  those citizens that normalize this administration because when the day comes that something horrific
[29:18.480 --> 29:23.040]  happens to us or to another community. I'll shut her up. I can't listen anymore to that liar.
[29:23.600 --> 29:27.680]  She won't condemn the acid attacks. Women have their genitals cut off,
[29:27.680 --> 29:34.080]  the gays being thrown off buildings. Any of it. Any of it. Pro-life feminists aren't allowed to
[29:34.080 --> 29:38.800]  march in those deals, but the Muslim women are. I mean, it's just the most sickening evil group
[29:38.800 --> 29:42.800]  using the fact that we're so tolerant to run all over us. Well, guess what? We're awake now,
[29:42.800 --> 29:50.160]  witch. So enjoy your little Hamas meeting, witch. We see you, witch. We're on the march. The empire's
[29:50.160 --> 30:01.360]  on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network. The New York Times ran the headline, Central
[30:01.360 --> 30:05.920]  Americans Scared of What's Happening in U.S. Staying Put. This has been a popular talking
[30:05.920 --> 30:10.320]  point of the left aimed at demonizing President Trump's strong border policy. But think about the
[30:10.320 --> 30:14.640]  paradigm here, implying that somehow it is a bad thing that people aren't rushing to our country
[30:14.640 --> 30:19.520]  in droves because it's not easy to get in and reside here illegally anymore. The same people
[30:19.520 --> 30:24.720]  implying this also stress the hardship of poor people, specifically citing health care. Well,
[30:24.720 --> 30:29.280]  then how is more people here that are in need going to help that problem? So the Democrats
[30:29.280 --> 30:33.600]  complain all day about how we don't have enough welfare for Americans, yet they want to take more
[30:33.600 --> 30:38.000]  people in here that need welfare. But really, all President Trump is doing is enforcing border
[30:38.000 --> 30:42.800]  security and law. But since when is it just free for anyone to come here? Since when is America
[30:42.800 --> 30:47.200]  supposed to have open doors for anyone? I don't see anyone from North America rushing to get into
[30:47.200 --> 30:52.160]  Central America. You know why? Because you couldn't, and it's better here. This all equates to one
[30:52.160 --> 30:59.040]  thing. More Democrats losing in upcoming elections. For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer. It's not
[30:59.040 --> 31:03.280]  just our water we need to filter. It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned. It's the air
[31:03.280 --> 31:08.320]  we're breathing, especially for our children. The artificial particulates of the chemicals
[31:08.320 --> 31:14.080]  is absolutely weighing down our immune systems. The same team based right here in America that
[31:14.080 --> 31:20.000]  brought you the Alexa pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa pure
[31:20.000 --> 31:25.200]  breeze. Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your
[31:25.200 --> 31:30.320]  children, to the best job you can to purify your air. The elite are masters at poisoning our
[31:30.320 --> 31:36.240]  environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[31:36.240 --> 31:42.880]  The general public doesn't. The Alexa pure breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500. One of these
[31:42.880 --> 31:47.760]  systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean. This is a system I'm personally putting in
[31:47.760 --> 31:52.640]  throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[31:52.640 --> 31:56.960]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at infowarsstore.com.
[31:58.960 --> 32:02.720]  Today, I'm excited to announce the new limited shipment of DNA forces finally arrived at the
[32:02.720 --> 32:07.200]  infowars warehouse in Austin, Texas. We have thousands of listeners on the waiting list who've
[32:07.200 --> 32:11.680]  signed up for auto ship to receive out of stock products at DNA force. And we are now once again
[32:11.680 --> 32:15.840]  expected to sell out very, very soon. When it comes to a formula that is such a game changer,
[32:15.840 --> 32:20.560]  like DNA force, we never know when we will be able to secure an additional supply of the key
[32:20.560 --> 32:25.840]  ingredients. The secret behind DNA force is its powerful lineup of patented ingredients like CoQ
[32:25.840 --> 32:32.800]  10, systematic enzymes, NAR, lipoic acid, BioPQQ and many others. BioPQQ alone is backed by an
[32:32.800 --> 32:38.480]  unprecedented 175 clinical studies. And just one batch of this stuff costs us more than $30,000.
[32:39.120 --> 32:44.480]  Visit infowarslife.com and read the reviews for yourself. Over 700 reviews have given DNA force
[32:44.480 --> 32:50.000]  an unheard of 4.8 out of 5 stars through our third party certified review agency, Power Review.
[32:50.000 --> 32:54.560]  Take advantage of this new limited shipment and get DNA force today at infowarslife.com
[32:54.560 --> 32:57.120]  before it sells out again. That's infowarslife.com.
[33:04.800 --> 33:09.360]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the infowar and say, I don't know what's going to
[33:09.360 --> 33:15.200]  happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe you've got one.
[33:16.080 --> 33:21.200]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[33:21.200 --> 33:35.040]  Let the great meme war of 2017 begin and let the fall of MSM become complete.
[33:52.160 --> 34:09.600]  Thank you, President Trump. CNN is fake news.
[34:11.680 --> 34:17.280]  I tell you, Walker and McBreen and the rest of the great crew are making some great memes.
[34:17.280 --> 34:24.400]  If you've just joined us, obviously memes are little short videos, graphics, images that in,
[34:24.400 --> 34:31.440]  I'd say, less than 10 to 15 words or images tell a story. Like Trump is Luke Skywalker,
[34:31.440 --> 34:37.680]  his face superimposed over Luke Skywalker in Episode 4, Flying the Trench, firing the torpedoes
[34:37.680 --> 34:43.760]  down the actor shaft and destroying the Death Star, which is replaced by the symbol of CNN.
[34:43.760 --> 34:48.000]  It doesn't literally mean we want to blow up CNN. We don't want any violence against them.
[34:48.000 --> 34:52.240]  We're not calling for active rioting like Newsweek or Time. We're not calling for killing
[34:52.240 --> 34:56.720]  the president or killing members of Congress or hashtag Hunt Republicans. We're simply saying,
[34:56.720 --> 35:02.800]  we have free speech to show the president metaphorically in battle, in hand-to-hand combat,
[35:02.800 --> 35:08.800]  defeating you. And we don't like you and we don't appreciate you. And we know you're a pack of liars
[35:08.800 --> 35:14.480]  who were down almost 95 percent in your ratings in the last decade. They've had a small dead cat
[35:14.480 --> 35:20.240]  bounce, but even that's going down right now. Before I go any further into all the big news,
[35:21.360 --> 35:25.920]  I started a $200,000 contest about a month ago that Mike Cernovich had the eye to do to say,
[35:25.920 --> 35:30.400]  basically, CNN is terrorist when Kathy Griffin put out the severed head bloody image of Trump
[35:30.400 --> 35:35.920]  to push that whole meme. And we've paid out, I guess, like 20 grand of folks who've done a great
[35:35.920 --> 35:41.520]  job, but CNN and other live TV, they've been really sequestering themselves in a fortress mentality
[35:42.880 --> 35:47.120]  behind closed doors. Because you have to legally and lawfully get live on TV.
[35:47.120 --> 35:52.080]  They've got to be outside to do it and say infowars.com, CNN's fake news. Get the $2,500,
[35:52.080 --> 35:59.360]  just show CNN is fake news or CNN is ISIS to hit the thousand. And we just do it to
[35:59.360 --> 36:08.080]  have some fun. But that whole CNN is ISIS meme that Cernovich thought of. But CNN promotes ISIS
[36:08.080 --> 36:13.920]  and Arab Spring and division and open borders. So, you know, the shoe certainly fits. And the
[36:13.920 --> 36:17.760]  general public had pushed that fact that they're ISIS and supporting ISIS. But Cernovich had the
[36:17.760 --> 36:22.800]  idea for the contest. And then I thought, let's expand it to CNN is very fake news.
[36:23.600 --> 36:27.840]  Let's expand it to just showing CNN doing any fake newscast, which they've been caught
[36:27.840 --> 36:35.040]  several times doing, basically rewarding people for being in the info war and just focusing on
[36:35.040 --> 36:42.160]  CNN, MSNBC, NBC, ABC, CBS, and really consciously recognizing what frauds they are. And also to
[36:42.160 --> 36:47.360]  finance that $200,000 contest, we've come up with like 10 different t-shirts. Now they're all limited
[36:47.360 --> 36:53.920]  edition. We're only doing one run of each. This one is on really nice soft fabric. CNN is fake news.
[36:53.920 --> 36:59.840]  Pretty much everybody agrees on that like 90% on the right hand shoulder info wars.com.
[37:00.480 --> 37:07.440]  And on the back info wars is real news. You will meet like minded people. You will spread the word.
[37:07.440 --> 37:11.520]  These aren't as insidious as Trump shirts. Probably get your dinner bought for you in
[37:11.520 --> 37:15.360]  conservative or libertarian areas might get attacked in Berkeley or downtown Austin.
[37:16.480 --> 37:23.040]  But this is a limited edition CNN is fake news shirt info wars is real news. This personally
[37:23.040 --> 37:28.480]  is my favorite shirt of the 10 or so different ones that we've put out, but they're all limited
[37:28.480 --> 37:36.560]  edition available at infowarstore.com. Now out of the $200,000, there's a lot of money for us,
[37:36.560 --> 37:40.400]  but it's worth it to get the word out and create a meme that can bring down the globalist. I mean,
[37:40.400 --> 37:45.600]  just Bill Clinton's a rapist operation was on national TV hundreds of times.
[37:46.320 --> 37:51.520]  Trump and others believe it was probably one of the deciding factors that didn't let them claim
[37:51.520 --> 37:56.240]  Trump was a predator with no evidence when there's Bill Clinton in plain view. Bill Clinton and
[37:56.240 --> 38:00.320]  Hillary are sexual predators. She covers up for predators. He is a known predator.
[38:01.840 --> 38:06.400]  They wanted to project their weakness onto Trump. We projected reality back on him.
[38:07.440 --> 38:12.160]  So a shield for Trump. They want to say he's a Russian agent because they're on the Russian payroll.
[38:13.680 --> 38:17.520]  That's collapsing. Whatever they do, they blame us. Okay.
[38:17.520 --> 38:24.720]  And so now if we really push this CNN is terrorist, CNN is fake news in the info war,
[38:24.720 --> 38:30.240]  it's over. And quite frankly, you see it manifesting through memes. You see it happening through memes.
[38:30.240 --> 38:35.680]  A lot of folks are calling an ISIS and calling them fake news and all the rest of it without even
[38:35.680 --> 38:41.120]  knowing where all of that basically came from. This is such an exciting time to be alive, ladies
[38:41.120 --> 38:48.960]  and gentlemen. So we're announcing a $20,000 chunk that'll be paid next Wednesday. Paul
[38:48.960 --> 38:53.360]  Watson's running it. He's in the email, our great info wars editor. He's in the email
[38:54.160 --> 38:59.200]  contest at info wars.com. And there's a lot of different ways to win the prize. If I think,
[38:59.200 --> 39:04.000]  you know, you, you win, you win. If I don't think you do, you don't, but I want to pay out.
[39:04.800 --> 39:10.400]  I want to do this. I want to see victory. I want to see success. Well now $20,000
[39:10.400 --> 39:20.720]  chunk out of that is going to one winner that makes the best Trump CNN meme that has info wars.com
[39:20.720 --> 39:24.640]  myself, Paul Watson. I don't care, promote info wars, promote freedom,
[39:24.640 --> 39:29.520]  promote the true independent press. Let folks know that your free speech doesn't end when they're
[39:29.520 --> 39:34.240]  offended. Practice the first amendment, just like the second amendment. So they can eradicate it
[39:34.240 --> 39:42.000]  and shun it and demonize it. And you will win $20,000. Paul Watson is going to be tweeting these.
[39:42.000 --> 39:47.440]  He's going to be writing about these, these memes that come in. Unfortunately, our own crew, I think
[39:47.440 --> 39:54.640]  is not eligible to be in this contest. They've already made some amazing ones, but I may have
[39:54.640 --> 39:58.720]  some private awards for some of the folks here in the office. But, but bottom line, be part of
[39:58.720 --> 40:03.280]  this. It could be a 30 second meme. It could be a five minute mini film. It could be, you know,
[40:03.280 --> 40:08.560]  just an image. Whatever that iconic thing is, Paul Watson is the judge. The judge alone,
[40:08.560 --> 40:19.280]  $20,000 and the contest has really got people excited right now. So they want to try to target
[40:19.280 --> 40:23.840]  some guy, have him come out and say he's racist and bad. Turns out that was a fake person probably
[40:23.840 --> 40:30.240]  made up by CNN. It was a Hispanic guy reportedly now. It was 16 years old in Mexico that made the
[40:30.240 --> 40:35.760]  funny meme. Mexico loves boxing, loves wrestling, loves memes, loves comedy, just like anybody else
[40:35.760 --> 40:39.440]  does. They're trying to make it racist, make it evil, make it hurtful. The whole thing was fake.
[40:39.440 --> 40:46.640]  They intimidated an imaginary person to show them buckling to CNN bullying and psychological
[40:46.640 --> 40:52.240]  extortion and terrorism and racketeering. That blew up in their face. And of course we learned
[40:52.240 --> 40:57.680]  as I predicted that it again was completely fake. But whatever you do, get the limited edition
[40:57.680 --> 41:02.160]  shirts. There's been like 10 or 11 designs, two or three of them are already sold out.
[41:02.160 --> 41:07.040]  This is the best design I believe. CNN is fake news, designed by yours truly. On the back,
[41:07.040 --> 41:14.880]  M4s is real news. And we've got one run of these that just got in on the 18-wheeler today. And
[41:14.880 --> 41:21.360]  when it's gone, it's gone. Limited edition shirt available. By the way, it's on expensive fabric.
[41:21.360 --> 41:27.600]  It cost us $10 to make this shirt. So that gives you, most shirts are like two, three dollars,
[41:27.600 --> 41:31.600]  you know, and then they sell them for $9.95. This is like $10 to print this really nice fabric.
[41:32.800 --> 41:37.680]  M4store.com, your purchase helps fund this meme contest. And you see what we're doing.
[41:37.680 --> 41:42.320]  You see how you're changing the world, taking action. And then we're creating the talking
[41:42.320 --> 41:48.240]  point based on common sense Americana that is being picked up by the entire world.
[41:48.240 --> 41:53.280]  I talked to folks that go overseas and they come back and they say, Alex,
[41:53.280 --> 41:56.800]  there's info or stickers everywhere. People are wearing info or shirts that are homemade.
[41:57.920 --> 42:04.240]  Roger Stone said he got mobbed off record. He told me some interesting stuff, but on record,
[42:04.240 --> 42:08.880]  he got mobbed, ladies and gentlemen. And he was meeting with the heads of state and foreign
[42:08.880 --> 42:13.520]  governments, major leadership, and they were, you know, say hi to Alex Jones. And again,
[42:13.520 --> 42:20.640]  it's not a power trip to say that it's, it's, it's the reality. So you know the fact that Americana
[42:21.440 --> 42:27.360]  and the basic vanguard of liberty that we are promoting is spreading across the world.
[42:28.000 --> 42:34.800]  Now, here's what President Trump had to say on North Korea. It comes to the end of the club,
[42:34.800 --> 42:39.840]  but, but at the first of the club, he talks about the meme and he talks about what CNN did
[42:39.840 --> 42:45.920]  Sunday, threatening to release the identity of someone if they didn't promise to ever not
[42:45.920 --> 42:50.560]  criticize CNN again, if they didn't promise to politically never be involved again.
[42:50.560 --> 42:56.160]  That's called terrorism. That's called racketeering. That's called violating federal and state law
[42:56.160 --> 43:03.840]  by the sniveling third string, drooling, Humpty Dumpty morons, these teleprompter reading
[43:03.840 --> 43:11.440]  followers at what is the Clinton news network, the communist news network, the Corleone news
[43:11.440 --> 43:21.920]  network, the coward news network, the Corleone news network. Let's go ahead and play the clip
[43:21.920 --> 43:25.760]  from the president about this. Since you started the whole wrestling video thing,
[43:26.720 --> 43:31.760]  what are your thoughts about what has happened since then? I mean, CNN went after you and has
[43:31.760 --> 43:35.200]  threatened to expose the identity of a person they said was responsible for it. I'd like your
[43:35.200 --> 43:41.040]  thoughts on that. Yeah, I think what CNN did was unfortunate for them. As you know, now they have
[43:41.040 --> 43:47.760]  some pretty serious problems. They have been fake news for a long time. They've been covering me in
[43:47.760 --> 43:57.360]  a very, very dishonest way. Do you have that also, by the way, Mr. President? With CNN and others,
[43:57.360 --> 44:02.880]  I mean, I know there's NBC as equally as bad, despite the fact that I made them a fortune
[44:02.880 --> 44:10.640]  with the apprentice, but they forgot that. But I will say that CNN has really taken it too seriously,
[44:10.640 --> 44:16.400]  and I think they've hurt themselves very badly, very, very badly. And what we want to see in
[44:16.400 --> 44:22.880]  the United States is honest, beautiful, free, but honest press. We want to see fair press. I think
[44:22.880 --> 44:28.000]  it's a very important thing. We don't want fake news. And by the way, not everybody is fake news,
[44:28.640 --> 44:32.320]  but we don't want fake news. Bad thing, very bad for our country.
[44:34.480 --> 44:35.920]  How could I be so stupid?
[44:38.960 --> 44:44.800]  You've played me. You've, you've played me. You, wait a minute.
[44:44.800 --> 44:54.560]  All of this is a orchestrated plan. You've got to love it, ladies and gentlemen.
[44:56.400 --> 45:00.080]  And already he's trying to turn the economy around. Fox comms announcing it wants to move
[45:00.080 --> 45:05.360]  factories back to the United States. That's the Apple Slave factories. The robots haven't turned
[45:05.360 --> 45:10.480]  out so good for him. They tried to replace the poor Chinese workers with. But the economy is
[45:10.480 --> 45:15.360]  slowing in new jobs in some places like Ron Paul said months ago here. He said Trump's doing a great
[45:15.360 --> 45:22.160]  job on the economy. Starting to see Ron Paul more and more cheerleading for Trump. But he said,
[45:22.160 --> 45:26.000]  I think it's too little, too late. The globalist want to kill the economy to stop Trump. And they
[45:26.000 --> 45:30.320]  admit they're doing that. I mean, they're in Atlantic monthly, the most elite, globalist
[45:30.320 --> 45:35.200]  publication in America. I mean, that's the talking points, how they want to COG overthrow Trump,
[45:35.200 --> 45:39.040]  how they want to suspend the last election, how they want to have the Democrats permanently with
[45:39.040 --> 45:45.040]  Homeland Security over elections like Venezuela or Cuba. I mean, this is so over the top, I can't
[45:45.040 --> 45:56.720]  even believe it. And now they're coming out saying the West will fall. Christianity will fall.
[45:57.280 --> 46:04.480]  White people are evil. It's like, what super ultra racism crud is this? And it's meant to divide
[46:04.480 --> 46:09.200]  everybody into groups. How do you control a prison? You have the Hispanic area, the white area,
[46:09.200 --> 46:12.880]  the black area, and if it's on the east coast or west coast in a big city with a lot of Asians,
[46:12.880 --> 46:16.960]  an Asian area, they'll break it in three to four groups. That's how you manage people.
[46:18.480 --> 46:23.120]  And that's a fact. And I don't want to be in a big prison. I don't want to be in my gated
[46:23.120 --> 46:29.120]  neighborhood scared of everybody. I want to see upwardly mobile people in the middle class and
[46:29.120 --> 46:33.440]  wealthy neighborhoods of every race, color and creed. And by the way, you see that all over the
[46:33.440 --> 46:38.720]  country now and people get along and they have fun and their sons and daughters love each other.
[46:39.600 --> 46:44.400]  That's another thing. You see, they push multiculturalism, but it was actually working.
[46:44.400 --> 46:47.440]  People are getting along. So now they've come in and just invoked all this division.
[46:48.320 --> 46:53.360]  Then they claim Trump. They claim Trump is the one creating all this division when they're the
[46:53.360 --> 46:59.360]  ones pushing and calling for all the over the top garbage. I mean, I cannot get over earlier.
[46:59.360 --> 47:05.360]  Linda Sarsour, the big Soros funded Islamists, and you've got the owner at Shabani Yogurt,
[47:05.360 --> 47:11.600]  who's on the Federal Reserve Board of New York City, that one that runs the whole country,
[47:11.600 --> 47:17.760]  just all these foreigners running our country. It's just absolutely sick. But see in Muslim countries,
[47:19.760 --> 47:24.960]  3,000 years ago, the Sahara was maybe 10% of the size it is. Okay, North Africa, it was,
[47:24.960 --> 47:28.880]  there were crocodiles, you know, in the middle of the Sahara Desert, where the Sahara Desert is
[47:28.880 --> 47:35.680]  today. There were horses, there were zebras, there were, it was it was jungly in many areas.
[47:35.680 --> 47:43.040]  And then the desertification began. I'm going to some history here. And there were all these
[47:43.040 --> 47:48.400]  populations and peoples. There were Africans, and there were Asians, and there were Caucasians,
[47:48.400 --> 47:55.360]  all these tribes, warring and fighting over the green fields of the Promised Land that was
[47:55.360 --> 48:00.400]  North Africa and Eastern Africa and the Middle East. There were some desert areas, but not a lot.
[48:00.400 --> 48:06.400]  But just like Texas, when the German and Polish and Czech and Irish and Scottish, mainly Scottish,
[48:06.400 --> 48:10.640]  immigrants came in, there was six foot grass everywhere, except in far West Texas.
[48:11.840 --> 48:16.880]  There was only about two inches of black soil. The cows ate it down and eroded, goats came in,
[48:16.880 --> 48:21.920]  ate it down. And then now it's desert in about a third of the Texas that wasn't
[48:21.920 --> 48:28.320]  an arid desert before. And the state's turning desert. And the desert's marching towards the East.
[48:29.040 --> 48:36.720]  That just happened in 160, 170 years. Same thing. So all these populations from Asia and Africa,
[48:37.360 --> 48:44.400]  and what's Europe today, were just in there, interbreeding, warring, slaving, killing. I mean,
[48:44.400 --> 48:49.920]  they've dug up Caucasian skeletons in China, you know, from 10,000 years ago, they've dug
[48:49.920 --> 48:56.640]  them up in Africa. It was just a free-for-all. And so that created the Arabs. That's what
[48:56.640 --> 49:03.120]  they are. They test their DNA. They are African, they are Asian, and they are Caucasian.
[49:04.320 --> 49:10.720]  But for the last 3,000 years or so, it's been desert. And so then it wasn't about economy
[49:10.720 --> 49:16.080]  anymore. It was all about murdering, slaving, killing, politically taking over and inbreeding.
[49:16.080 --> 49:24.560]  And so you've got a third war, a third world war zone, a stone age cultures and populations that
[49:24.560 --> 49:31.200]  come out of slavery, war, caravans, kidnapping, mass murder, thuggies, all the way, we get the
[49:31.200 --> 49:35.840]  word thug, all the way from India right into North Africa, just murdering and killing.
[49:37.280 --> 49:42.640]  That's where you get the word thug, folks, the thuggy. Child kidnapping, devil worship,
[49:42.640 --> 49:50.880]  just every whacked out thing you could imagine. And now it got taken over by Islam 1400 years ago,
[49:50.880 --> 49:55.120]  but it all has that in its genetics and its roots, and now it's being brought in,
[49:55.120 --> 49:59.760]  and it's not about working, it's not about having a job, it's about politically taking over.
[49:59.760 --> 50:04.960]  And that's what the Muslims do. And I'm sorry, they think I'm stupid, I'm not. A lot of Muslims
[50:04.960 --> 50:09.120]  want to be Americans, they want to be heretics, they want to be free, I get it, I'm all for that.
[50:09.120 --> 50:14.160]  But the first waves were the doctors and the scientists and the refugees from Islam,
[50:14.160 --> 50:20.240]  they were great people. We're not getting that now. We're getting folks that don't know what
[50:20.240 --> 50:28.480]  planet they're on and it is dangerous. And they've declared Jihad Ergun, the dictator of Turkey,
[50:28.480 --> 50:34.080]  bordering Europe, has declared Jihad and has threatened to burn every city in Europe down
[50:34.080 --> 50:39.040]  and is now activating his Islamic forces and told Germany, I'm going to fly in during the G20,
[50:39.040 --> 50:45.760]  and I'm going to speak to the Muslims, and they said no. I mean, again, even the Muslims are now
[50:45.760 --> 50:50.480]  double crossing the EU that sold Europe out early. They're like Ergun, you were supposed to sell us
[50:50.480 --> 50:55.840]  out in your son's time and then kill all the men and take the women. And Ergun goes, we will take
[50:55.840 --> 51:01.360]  them now. His top imams are saying that. If food became scarce, would you be able to feed yourself

[54:49.440 --> 54:56.720]  that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States. Waging war on corruption and
[54:56.720 --> 55:16.400]  winnings. Alex Jones. Victory. The Trump Hulk powered by info wars. Powered by America. You are one of you beneath me. I am a god, you dull creature, and I will not be bullied by that.
[55:16.400 --> 55:39.120]  You've got Macron saying he is the god Jupiter. That's Roman for Zeus in Greek.
[55:40.720 --> 55:45.760]  And they questioned about it and he said and now your children will all have 11 mandatory vaccines
[55:45.760 --> 55:49.600]  and he called the government together at the palace of Versailles, the sun god,
[55:49.600 --> 55:57.680]  more delusional garbage, Louie the whatever he was, and said I am a god and you will do what I say.
[55:59.680 --> 56:05.920]  I mean they've taken the child sex toy of the elite, they admit that, and put him on a gold throne
[56:05.920 --> 56:13.840]  and are all worshiping him. I mean France is truly off its rocker, man, completely off its
[56:13.840 --> 56:20.240]  rocker. And they had him do his acceptance speech in front of a giant pyramid with an all-seeing eye.
[56:20.240 --> 56:24.880]  That's a real photo if you're watching us on TV, by the way folks keep spreading the word about the broadcast.
[56:24.880 --> 56:27.520]  They're trying to censor, they're trying to block, they're trying to block memes,
[56:27.520 --> 56:31.520]  they're trying to stop info wars, but they can't stop you spreading the link by hand,
[56:31.520 --> 56:37.840]  putting it on business cards, calling it to talk radio, c-span, with CNN is fake news, info wars.com.
[56:38.560 --> 56:43.600]  This is the tip of the spear. They're trying to crush us as an example to others to intimidate others.
[56:43.600 --> 56:49.280]  And they want to give simulated mentally ill victories to liberals who kind of buy into the system
[56:49.280 --> 56:55.920]  and live through extension vicariously through the mainstream media. They believe they're the
[56:55.920 --> 57:01.520]  cultural elites. They believe that, you know, establishment fashion in Hollywood is still
[57:01.520 --> 57:08.560]  avant-garde. There's nothing more uncool than to be modern avant-garde. It's not avant-garde.
[57:08.560 --> 57:14.320]  Nationalism, freedom, the renaissance, strength, men being men, women being women. You can be
[57:14.320 --> 57:18.960]  whatever you want. I don't care if you're a train here. Well, I literally don't, but you want to
[57:18.960 --> 57:25.280]  act like I do and then make me accept teaching my children about it. Uh-uh, that's called perfect
[57:25.280 --> 57:30.880]  behavior. That's called mainline and pedophilia. We're going to go to break. We have huge breaking
[57:30.880 --> 57:36.080]  news coming up. Pop scientists are worried about the real Andromeda strain. I haven't gotten to this
[57:36.080 --> 57:40.720]  yet. New Kamiro news. I'm really going to focus in on actual documents. I forgot mother folder.
[57:40.720 --> 57:46.320]  Can I have my Kamiro folder? We've got more on the Vatican sex scandal that we broke on Monday
[57:46.320 --> 57:50.880]  with total precision, total precision. And then three days later, two days later, it all broke
[57:50.880 --> 57:56.000]  exactly as we said, the mass gay orgy and exactly who he told you was involved because Leo Zagami
[57:56.000 --> 58:00.480]  lives, lives by there. He meets with the Vatican police. I'm going to leave it at that. I have
[58:00.480 --> 58:04.640]  been with him when he met with them and then went off and had a closed door meeting with him.
[58:04.640 --> 58:09.280]  So I don't just believe Zagami. I went there to see it for myself and I'll leave it at that for
[58:09.280 --> 58:14.720]  you. Uh, but that is all coming up briefly. Three shipping throughout the month of July. I've

[59:44.400 --> 1:00:00.320]  It's a win win info wars life.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:00.320 --> 1:00:18.240]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex
[1:00:18.240 --> 1:00:27.680]  Jones. Well, growth is slowing as the globalist try to drive down the stock market and kill
[1:00:27.680 --> 1:00:32.640]  investment, but still Trump's trying to pull us out of the storm and your exuberance is helping
[1:00:32.640 --> 1:00:38.000]  do that as well. Boom times for recruiters, iPhone maker, Fox considering bringing jobs in
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:44.960]  Wisconsin, Silicon Valley, new vision of for pizzeria robots. That's right, less jobs for folks. So
[1:00:44.960 --> 1:00:50.320]  let's get rid of more jobs in the globalist know that humans build their own environment.
[1:00:50.320 --> 1:00:58.720]  But look at drudge drug fueled gay orgy at Vatican church rocked Pope fury. His answer
[1:00:58.720 --> 1:01:03.680]  is to remove all the conservative leaders who are criticizing it. Now, where did you hear
[1:01:03.680 --> 1:01:11.200]  about this because this broke mainstream news on Wednesday night or Wednesday. And then now
[1:01:13.680 --> 1:01:19.360]  we've got this. Now, now, now, where did we all originally hear about that? That's right. Let's
[1:01:19.360 --> 1:01:26.240]  play this clip from Leo Zagami on the broadcast Monday from Rome, who broke it on his website
[1:01:27.520 --> 1:01:35.360]  over the weekend. Here it is. A conflict a few days before George Pell got booted out of the Vatican.
[1:01:35.360 --> 1:01:41.920]  We had basically the police breaking inside the palace of the Holy office, the ex inquisition
[1:01:41.920 --> 1:01:47.920]  now known as the congregation for the matters of faith. Basically, the headquarters of the most
[1:01:47.920 --> 1:01:55.040]  holy office in the Vatican, the police broke in and found a gay orgy. And they were using cocaine
[1:01:55.040 --> 1:02:01.760]  and they basically had to arrest the secretary of a very prominent cardinal who himself was
[1:02:01.760 --> 1:02:07.840]  waging war against cardinal Pell. So there is also an internal war here. And of course,
[1:02:08.480 --> 1:02:15.920]  nobody wanted to show the face of this priest. But I wanted to show it to your viewers.
[1:02:15.920 --> 1:02:23.760]  This is called Monsignor Luigi Capozzi and only very few media think only RT probably
[1:02:23.760 --> 1:02:29.040]  just mentioned the name of Capozzi's boss. So there you go. And he had reported it
[1:02:29.840 --> 1:02:33.120]  days before and then RT had just barely mentioned there was some swat rate, but
[1:02:33.760 --> 1:02:38.080]  a bit nice in the full deal. Now, now let's expand on that. You've got the deputy pope
[1:02:39.120 --> 1:02:44.880]  being busted days before reportedly recruiting and then raping and grabbing and procuring hundreds
[1:02:44.880 --> 1:02:50.800]  of children. What does Hillary Clinton stay up late at night? What does John Podesta stay up late
[1:02:50.800 --> 1:02:57.200]  at night worried about? They worry about us, ladies and gentlemen. And that's why I'm so proud
[1:02:57.200 --> 1:03:01.680]  of the work we've all been doing together. But that's why we're targeted. That's why we're under
[1:03:01.680 --> 1:03:05.680]  attack. That's why they make things up about us that we never said or did or that they edit together
[1:03:05.680 --> 1:03:10.960]  to twist is because they want to inoculate the public not to believe us when we tell them things
[1:03:10.960 --> 1:03:15.120]  that are true because without drugs report, without info wars, without a few other outlets,
[1:03:16.640 --> 1:03:20.800]  none of this information would ever come out. We're able because of our audience
[1:03:22.800 --> 1:03:27.360]  to punch through. Let's put that Ben Garrison graphic back up from during the campaign.
[1:03:27.360 --> 1:03:30.800]  What keeps Hillary up at night? What keeps the globalist up at night?
[1:03:31.520 --> 1:03:36.320]  The make America great again movement. Alex shows the info wars. You know, folks like
[1:03:36.320 --> 1:03:42.160]  the UKip movement and Nigel Farage. That's the reality. But more important than ever,
[1:03:42.160 --> 1:03:48.160]  it's to make America great movement. You're imagining things. Hillary go back to sleep.
[1:03:48.160 --> 1:03:50.400]  Uma, the racist boogeymen are here.
[1:03:52.320 --> 1:03:56.240]  They get the little pickle jar there and all her pills where she couldn't open the pickle jar.
[1:03:56.240 --> 1:04:01.840]  And then it turned out she didn't open the pickle jar. She'd, she'd already had it open for and
[1:04:01.840 --> 1:04:06.720]  then Jimmy Kimmel had admit Alex Jones is right. Alex Jones is right.
[1:04:09.040 --> 1:04:12.960]  Hillary Clinton is sick. Hillary Clinton fell down. Hillary Clinton a month after we told you
[1:04:12.960 --> 1:04:17.520]  the secret service told us saving seizures every 45 minutes as a special black ambulance.
[1:04:17.520 --> 1:04:22.800]  You saw it all. We told you Trump was going to win. We told you the polls were fake. We told
[1:04:22.800 --> 1:04:26.240]  you she tried to steal the states. We told you they were given the questions about the debates
[1:04:26.240 --> 1:04:30.880]  beforehand. We told you your toaster and your new microwave ovens got microphones in it.
[1:04:30.880 --> 1:04:36.160]  We told the dishwashers watching you. All of it true. All of it's come out. So what do they do?
[1:04:36.160 --> 1:04:41.760]  They go, he's fake news. But instead the wreath of fake news is hung around their neck
[1:04:43.200 --> 1:04:46.240]  and then they send in their little henchwoman, their little witchy poo.
[1:04:47.520 --> 1:04:52.160]  They send her on a fool's errand. They send Megan Telly here. Just like Piers Morgan,
[1:04:52.160 --> 1:04:56.480]  they come to the info ward to politically die. And now she's sinking like a stone.
[1:04:56.480 --> 1:05:04.000]  President Trump's tweets have sent the Democrats into a tizzy again. After President Trump ripped
[1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:09.040]  Psycho Joe and no IQ Mika last week, Trump got back on Twitter yesterday and posted a
[1:05:09.040 --> 1:05:14.640]  short video of himself beating up another man depicted as a CNN logo, a total classic.
[1:05:14.640 --> 1:05:18.960]  But the Democrats didn't appreciate Trump's animosity towards the fake news network CNN
[1:05:18.960 --> 1:05:22.480]  and are now drumming up the bill for impeachment based on the 25th amendment,
[1:05:22.480 --> 1:05:27.200]  citing grounds that the president is mentally unfit to serve. Now this would require a medical
[1:05:27.200 --> 1:05:31.840]  examination, which may come back to bite the Democrats that are calling for it. You see,
[1:05:31.840 --> 1:05:36.160]  given a fair examination of the president's health, Trump will pass with flying colors.
[1:05:36.160 --> 1:05:41.120]  But imagine if the tables were turned and Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Maxine Waters,
[1:05:41.120 --> 1:05:45.120]  Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders were asked to pass the same test,
[1:05:45.120 --> 1:05:49.520]  given the importance of their jobs. I wonder if they would still be pushing this bill.
[1:05:49.520 --> 1:05:54.080]  Something tells me they wouldn't be. For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[1:05:59.920 --> 1:06:05.200]  Michael ZX is back in after five plus months sold out. Talk about next level probiotic,

[1:06:10.240 --> 1:06:14.000]  months, big waiting list, limited amount because it's so hard to get the compounds and

[1:06:45.840 --> 1:06:48.560]  epidemic, but I'm getting ready to have a bunch of folks go ahead and come on here and tell you
[1:06:48.560 --> 1:06:53.120]  what it did for them because regardless, you can't lose your fun in the operation. Infowarslife.com,

[1:07:58.080 --> 1:08:10.480]  Avorted babies incinerated to eat UK hospitals.
[1:08:11.680 --> 1:08:18.000]  Silent green, ladies and gentlemen, is made out of people. But now children are literally being
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:23.840]  passed through the furnace in order to fuel hospitals in the UK. They're being sacrificed
[1:08:23.840 --> 1:08:33.200]  on the altar of efficiency and prosperity. It is the secret of Silent Green. The powdered flesh
[1:08:33.200 --> 1:08:39.520]  from dead babies. Some people believe they can cure disease. Because of its enormous popularity,
[1:08:39.520 --> 1:08:46.160]  Silent Green is in short supply. Remember, Tuesday is Silent Green Day. The supply of
[1:08:46.160 --> 1:08:54.800]  soil in green has been exhausted. You must evacuate the area. Is that the rule that the
[1:08:54.800 --> 1:09:00.160]  shareholders of PepsiCo, Big Builder Bird Group company, are not allowed to know
[1:09:01.520 --> 1:09:04.880]  what they're using the baby parts for and the flavoring, but we already know.
[1:09:05.520 --> 1:09:10.160]  So enjoy the flavor. We're going to get the real solution, which is going to be a combination
[1:09:10.160 --> 1:09:15.920]  of death panels and sales taxes. I'm consistently pro-death. I'm for assisted suicide.
[1:09:15.920 --> 1:09:19.120]  I'm for regulars, though. I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving.
[1:09:19.120 --> 1:09:22.880]  Is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient,
[1:09:23.440 --> 1:09:30.240]  would it be better not to lay off those 10 teachers and to make that trade up in medical
[1:09:30.240 --> 1:09:34.880]  costs? But that's called the death panel. And you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[1:09:34.880 --> 1:09:49.280]  They told me to say that they were sorry, but that you had become unreliable.
[1:09:49.280 --> 1:09:53.760]  Is this the kind of society that you want to live in? Any kind of society that would do this to
[1:09:53.760 --> 1:09:59.840]  its children will do it to its senior citizens. It will do it to its dissidents. That kind of
[1:09:59.840 --> 1:10:05.840]  society will also eventually turn on its police, on its army, on its prison guards, on the quizlings
[1:10:05.840 --> 1:10:12.880]  and the collaborators who make that possible. This is nothing but a suicide cult. The scoops are on
[1:10:12.880 --> 1:10:20.880]  their way. The scoops are on their way. I repeat, the scoops are on their way. You will find out
[1:10:20.880 --> 1:10:27.600]  why Soylent Green means life. You will find out why Soylent Green means death. We got to stop them.
[1:10:27.600 --> 1:10:36.320]  Soylent Green is people. Soylent Green is people.
[1:10:36.320 --> 1:10:40.800]  You've got to stop them. Soon they'll be breeding us like cats. Soon they'll be breeding us like
[1:10:40.800 --> 1:10:48.640]  cattle for food. You've got to tell them. You know, I hate Hollywood. I'm almost embarrassed
[1:10:48.640 --> 1:10:53.920]  other than a few big Hollywood films. It's just so anathema. I just, I still get giddy over the
[1:10:53.920 --> 1:10:58.560]  fact that I interviewed Charlton Heston a few times and had some lengthy phone conversations with
[1:10:58.560 --> 1:11:06.240]  him because he was so real and so cool and spent, I mean, the word, it was like $50 million. Most
[1:11:06.240 --> 1:11:12.640]  of his money, funding the NRA, his own private jet, flying around the country, meeting and talking
[1:11:12.640 --> 1:11:17.200]  with school kids. Other talk show hosts I know said that he would encourage them and have phone
[1:11:17.200 --> 1:11:21.360]  conversations with them and pray with them on the phone and stuff. I had a few conversations with him.
[1:11:21.360 --> 1:11:27.680]  And I mean, just such a cool guy, the opposite of an ego maniac. He was in the civil rights movement
[1:11:28.320 --> 1:11:34.560]  in the 50s and got attacked and roughed up and stuff. I mean, we're talking about marching in
[1:11:34.560 --> 1:11:39.200]  Oklahoma and marching in Alabama when you got killed doing it. He was somebody that came around
[1:11:39.200 --> 1:11:43.200]  later in the late 60s and acted like he was part of it. Just such a cool guy, Charlton Heston.
[1:11:43.200 --> 1:11:48.000]  A true civil rights activist for all of our rights. I just, every time I see Charlton Heston or
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:54.720]  think about it, he's just so cool compared to these purely selfless, selfish, worldly people
[1:11:54.720 --> 1:12:00.640]  that want power. But the real power is being honorable and night like, like a Charlton Heston,
[1:12:00.640 --> 1:12:04.800]  Dr. Group. No, I totally agree. I mean, I think Lindsay Lohan or something just came out. I saw
[1:12:04.800 --> 1:12:09.600]  something on Drudge to where she was supporting President Trump. What gets me is the fact that
[1:12:09.600 --> 1:12:14.480]  there's just so much negativity going on right now. I mean, you have so many different things.
[1:12:14.480 --> 1:12:19.760]  I mean, I have a lot of respect for President Trump because he's got so many things on his
[1:12:19.760 --> 1:12:25.920]  plate right now and so much opposition coming at him as well from every different direction.
[1:12:26.560 --> 1:12:31.280]  I just feel like I owe him a debt for being so real. Just like Heston or Barry Goldwater or Ron
[1:12:31.280 --> 1:12:36.720]  Paul. I see these elder statesmen and people that have done so much. And as a man, I just
[1:12:36.720 --> 1:12:42.720]  feel such fealty and support for them, kinship. It's very spiritual. I don't think people,
[1:12:42.720 --> 1:12:46.880]  the globalists spend all their time, Dr. Group, never wanting men to get to that level in their
[1:12:46.880 --> 1:12:50.640]  lives. Sorry, go ahead. Well, the reason why is because they're trying to sterilize all the men.
[1:12:50.640 --> 1:12:54.160]  I mean, there's a big huge, it's been going on for years and years and years. I mean,
[1:12:54.160 --> 1:12:58.720]  the population control and all the stuff that we've been exposing about the chemicals in the food
[1:12:58.720 --> 1:13:03.840]  and the glyphosate and the engineering that's going on and the chimeras and all of the things
[1:13:03.840 --> 1:13:08.560]  that we're dealing with right now as far as controlling the population. One of the shocking
[1:13:08.560 --> 1:13:14.400]  things that really has gotten me is how the far left and how the Democrats have handled this
[1:13:14.400 --> 1:13:23.120]  election. I mean, the robotic culture, the violence, the attacks, all of this stuff. And,
[1:13:23.120 --> 1:13:27.440]  you know, we're talking about healthcare. It's publicly, you said this 20 years ago,
[1:13:27.440 --> 1:13:31.520]  but it's publicly aimed at our consciousness. I don't mean that as metaphysical, our real brain
[1:13:31.520 --> 1:13:35.840]  waves. Look at the WikiLeaks. It says we must keep them in the dark. We must keep them desperate.
[1:13:35.840 --> 1:13:40.720]  We must keep them grasping. We can't let them have hope. I mean, these, the Democrats and Soros
[1:13:40.720 --> 1:13:47.760]  are pure evil. Talking about healthcare, the new healthcare reform, I'm wondering, I mean, every
[1:13:47.760 --> 1:13:54.400]  single person that I know that is far left. And I try to talk to them and say, listen,
[1:13:54.400 --> 1:13:58.800]  you don't have to believe me. Why don't you just go do your own research about genetically modified
[1:13:58.800 --> 1:14:03.920]  foods? Now we have GMOs 2.0s with the CRISPR technology and the genetic engineering. It's
[1:14:03.920 --> 1:14:09.920]  the new way that Monsanto and Sinjenta and Dow Agri Sciences and everybody else can get away from
[1:14:09.920 --> 1:14:14.000]  having to label their stuff. It is light years. It is light years worse. And we're going to,
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:16.560]  you're going to be with us a little bit in the next hour. We have another guest joining us.
[1:14:16.560 --> 1:14:20.080]  We're going to get into all that, Dr. Group, but you were also just a special operations stuff,
[1:14:20.080 --> 1:14:25.360]  special task forces with the military in Korea. I want to get your take on that escalating situation
[1:14:25.360 --> 1:14:30.640]  with the top military commander for the U.S. says we're prepared for war with North Korea.
[1:14:30.640 --> 1:14:35.920]  So does the commander of the Korean forces. So we've got the biggest preparations ever for war.
[1:14:35.920 --> 1:14:40.560]  You were telling me off air. Is it a trap for Trump? We'll discuss that. But before we go any
[1:14:40.560 --> 1:14:47.760]  further, what do you make of Trump and millions on the streets of Warsaw to see Trump? Trump saying
[1:14:47.760 --> 1:14:52.880]  we will defend the West. Newsweek saying that's racist. Atlantic Monthly saying, no, the West
[1:14:52.880 --> 1:14:59.120]  will fall. Muslims will take over Christianity. I mean, these are quotes. How could these globalists
[1:14:59.120 --> 1:15:04.240]  be any more racist, any more traitor? And then they're white people doing it, trying to get
[1:15:04.240 --> 1:15:08.880]  everybody fighting with each other to divide and conquer against free market. They're trying to sell
[1:15:09.920 --> 1:15:15.360]  the minorities, the majority times seven globally on not wanting free market,
[1:15:16.480 --> 1:15:21.520]  trying to Trump free market and prosperity with some weird racism brainwashing.
[1:15:21.520 --> 1:15:28.000]  Well, because the shadow governments for years have controlled the world. And when you look at
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:31.920]  all these other countries, that's why you're starting to see the people because it's we,
[1:15:31.920 --> 1:15:35.120]  the people that make a difference in the world. They're starting to stand up and they're starting
[1:15:35.120 --> 1:15:40.880]  to say, if they can do it in the United States, if they can turn around and get these globalists
[1:15:40.880 --> 1:15:46.640]  out of the office, it didn't matter if they were Republican or Democrat. I mean, if you just study
[1:15:46.640 --> 1:15:52.240]  how it all works and who really runs the whole system, those are just puppets. But for once,
[1:15:52.240 --> 1:15:58.720]  the first time, just independence day here. I mean, all the people, I've never experienced
[1:15:58.720 --> 1:16:05.520]  so much joy on the 4th of July in the last 20 years. I've never seen as many flags flying in
[1:16:05.520 --> 1:16:12.000]  yards. I've never seen so many people coming together as one. Have you? No, I mean, I was
[1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:15.760]  watching Fox News earlier and I guess we didn't have the DVR on. It showed from the top of a
[1:16:15.760 --> 1:16:21.280]  building and it was like 10 streets filled over a million people out to see Trump. It was just
[1:16:21.280 --> 1:16:27.040]  huge giant crowds saying Trump, Trump, Trump, USA. Because again, Poland's been the front line of
[1:16:27.040 --> 1:16:32.320]  hundreds of Islamic invasions. They know the truth and they understand that this is an existential
[1:16:32.320 --> 1:16:37.280]  threat just like the Nazis were to Poland. Now the new threat, it was the Soviet Union. Now the
[1:16:37.280 --> 1:16:42.160]  new threat is Islam. They're starting to see that people can make a difference. I mean, that people
[1:16:42.160 --> 1:16:47.840]  came together. No one in the world thought that Trump was going to win. All of a sudden, Trump
[1:16:47.840 --> 1:16:54.160]  wins. It gives hope to the world. I said he was going to win. Well, we said he was going to win.
[1:16:54.160 --> 1:16:57.840]  That's why they were panicking. We had the internal Google numbers. That was even coming out in
[1:16:57.840 --> 1:17:01.840]  trade publications. The Bloomberg interfaces, they're tied into everything. It's like its own
[1:17:01.840 --> 1:17:06.320]  private NSA, as you know. That's how he's made hundreds of billions. They all knew Trump was
[1:17:06.320 --> 1:17:10.320]  like 15, 20 points ahead. That's why they kept oversampling, try to create the illusion that
[1:17:10.320 --> 1:17:14.400]  he was going to lose. Then they tried to steal the election, but the state authorities were there
[1:17:14.400 --> 1:17:19.600]  blocking Obama and Homeland Security from breaking in. They caught him and they blocked the hacks.
[1:17:19.600 --> 1:17:25.440]  In six states, we failed in five. Trump almost lost, but I mean, because again, imagine if
[1:17:25.440 --> 1:17:30.320]  you would have had the real victory, a 15, 20 point win in the popular vote. Instead of Hillary
[1:17:30.320 --> 1:17:35.360]  stealing so much, it looked like she won by two million. Oh, I know. And now California's refusing
[1:17:35.360 --> 1:17:40.720]  to release their voter data because Trump's put together that. And Harvard confirms 5.7 million
[1:17:40.720 --> 1:17:47.280]  did vote illegally. Not 3.3, 5.7. No. So I mean, get to get back to your point. I mean, I think
[1:17:47.280 --> 1:17:53.600]  with Poland and all Poland has been run over by the Russians, run over by the Nazis, but run over
[1:17:53.600 --> 1:17:59.600]  hundreds of times by the Muslims. And you know, that's the fact. Think about all the good. Imagine
[1:17:59.600 --> 1:18:04.880]  if you lived in a country where you had been overrun hundreds of times every generation
[1:18:04.880 --> 1:18:11.680]  by Muslims mass murdering you. Would you then let them in? No, I wouldn't. But when you have people
[1:18:11.680 --> 1:18:16.720]  like Soros and you have people that are funding these revolutions for the negative side and trying
[1:18:16.720 --> 1:18:22.000]  to create socialism in different countries and even in America where we're only, you know, we were
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:30.000]  so close to having our guns taken away and they're still creating that persona to develop or put us
[1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:34.960]  in a socialist republic with healthcare and they wanting the one payer system and all this. When
[1:18:34.960 --> 1:18:39.440]  will they realize that everything that they've done has failed miserably? They know, but it's
[1:18:39.440 --> 1:18:43.760]  about power. They came out and said it was about bankrupting healthcare. So a big bank could have
[1:18:43.760 --> 1:18:48.160]  single payer and controllers and take over one seventh of the economy and expand the cost. Now,
[1:18:48.880 --> 1:18:53.440]  Pocahontas has come out and said, yes, we want to wreck it. That's the plan. We always told you
[1:18:53.440 --> 1:18:57.600]  that because they said that was the plan. Let me ask you this. We're going to break. I played
[1:18:57.600 --> 1:19:01.520]  the Soylent Green intro because we're going to get into some of these runaway technologies
[1:19:01.520 --> 1:19:06.320]  that even mainline scientists say are already destabilizing the earth, the true environmental
[1:19:06.320 --> 1:19:12.320]  threats to our own lives, the planet, the real Andromeda strain, all of it coming up the next
[1:19:12.320 --> 1:19:16.480]  segment. But you've got a bunch of other topics you want to get into. Well, I mean, we could talk
[1:19:16.480 --> 1:19:20.320]  about all different kinds of things. What we're seeing right now, again, is just a world that's
[1:19:20.320 --> 1:19:24.480]  stressed out, but it's starting to be good. I mean, it's starting, we're starting to see people that
[1:19:24.480 --> 1:19:28.960]  are actually have hope again, that have joy in their lives again, people that are going online,
[1:19:28.960 --> 1:19:34.480]  you get all these memes. I mean, everything is backfiring. Like all the positive is starting
[1:19:34.480 --> 1:19:38.480]  to take over. The pendulum is swinging hard. The negative is starting to go down and you're
[1:19:38.480 --> 1:19:43.040]  starting to see that. And you're starting to see all of the people that are coming together and the
[1:19:44.080 --> 1:19:48.240]  joy. And the elites are panicking, some are admitting they're losing, but others are going,
[1:19:48.240 --> 1:19:52.960]  I'm God like Macron. He declared himself God emperor. Yeah, look what happened to CNN,
[1:19:52.960 --> 1:19:57.200]  which is that one meme. I mean, now you have thousands of memes coming out. Absolutely.

[1:24:15.520 --> 1:24:19.520]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:24:19.520 --> 1:24:25.760]  Live from the InfoWars.com Studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:24:31.440 --> 1:24:38.800]  Not only scared, I'm a doctor. A special laboratory in Nevada. We brought you here.
[1:24:39.600 --> 1:24:44.800]  You're sick. In a true biological crisis, which our exploration of space could bring about,
[1:24:44.800 --> 1:24:50.320]  the present lunar receiving laboratory might prove inadequate. I therefore urge the establishment
[1:24:50.320 --> 1:24:54.720]  of a facility to deal specifically with an extraterrestrial form of life. It seems to me
[1:24:54.720 --> 1:24:59.440]  general, Dr. Stone put one over on you. In fact, you may as well think his wildfire lab could handle
[1:24:59.440 --> 1:25:09.360]  any contamination from outer space. Isolate and identify him. Good God. It's no accident. I suspect
[1:25:09.360 --> 1:25:18.400]  they were looking for the ultimate biological weapon. You could change everything. From the novel
[1:25:18.400 --> 1:25:22.720]  by Michael Crichton. It's crazy. I didn't know buzzards fly at night. Buzzards only come when
[1:25:22.720 --> 1:25:28.160]  something's dead. Bands are not going to keep a one. What's that? We see bodies. Most of them.
[1:25:28.800 --> 1:25:33.760]  These people are cut down in mid-stride. Everybody's dead. No, no, no.
[1:25:33.760 --> 1:25:39.840]  I recommend calling a wildfire alert. All members of your team have been cleared and are now being
[1:25:39.840 --> 1:25:45.760]  crawled in. If things get out of control, even you can't work miracles. Grandpa, there's a car
[1:25:45.760 --> 1:25:50.480]  and they got guns. What's going on? This communication is being monitored.
[1:25:50.480 --> 1:26:02.560]  Never believe this could really happen. You knew, Stone. You knew it.
[1:26:08.720 --> 1:26:12.720]  I can't think of the possibility. I wish I could believe you. What you do or not,
[1:26:12.720 --> 1:26:16.080]  the only important thing now is to find me. I don't know. Even with a Michael's left
[1:26:16.080 --> 1:26:22.080]  of life. I'm turning off the oxygen. Experiment with your own life. Damn it. I'm scared.
[1:26:27.120 --> 1:26:30.800]  Now, the reason I wanted to play that, we're going to get into this a lot more in the next
[1:26:30.800 --> 1:26:38.800]  longer segment with Dr. Group, is there are thousands and thousands of new animal, human,
[1:26:38.800 --> 1:26:45.280]  clones, chimeras, not just embryonic. They're then putting those genetics into corn that grows
[1:26:45.280 --> 1:26:50.480]  pharmacological stem cells. This is the stuff that's admitted for decades. They have created
[1:26:51.600 --> 1:26:55.200]  tens of thousands of animal, animal, animal, insect, animal, plant,
[1:26:56.080 --> 1:27:01.520]  chimeras from Greek mythology, but it's real. Now, for 20-something years, I've been talking
[1:27:01.520 --> 1:27:05.680]  about it. The media would always say it didn't exist, but it was in medical and scientific
[1:27:05.680 --> 1:27:13.200]  literature. Now, top scientists are in pop science, eco watch, Smithsonian, evaluation of
[1:27:13.200 --> 1:27:19.680]  phenotype stability and ecological risk of a genetically engineered algae in open pond production.
[1:27:19.680 --> 1:27:24.880]  They're putting stuff that's totally alien. It's not real algae. It's not real bacteria.
[1:27:24.880 --> 1:27:30.080]  It's not real mold. It's not real yeast. It's not real algae. It's a mix of all these. You
[1:27:30.080 --> 1:27:35.520]  basically can't kill it. It grows 100 times faster or more. I'm not saying this will be
[1:27:35.520 --> 1:27:39.600]  the Andromeda strain. I'm saying with tens of thousands of experiments going on every month
[1:27:39.600 --> 1:27:44.320]  now, this acceleration, something much bigger than Manhattan Project, how long until it triggers
[1:27:44.320 --> 1:27:48.880]  something disastrous? We've already seen disasters, but this makes nuclear plants melting down
[1:27:48.880 --> 1:27:54.000]  lipteam. Dr. Group, are we approaching the Atlantean moment and why are the elite doing this?
[1:27:54.720 --> 1:27:59.920]  It's been going on for a long time when DARPA started messing around with transgenics,
[1:28:00.800 --> 1:28:07.360]  taking animal DNA or genes and merging them with humans and cross species, basically,
[1:28:07.360 --> 1:28:12.800]  whatever you want to say. It morphed into genetically modified organisms for our food.
[1:28:12.800 --> 1:28:19.040]  DARPA was doing the research with the spider goats back in the day to create high tensile
[1:28:19.040 --> 1:28:24.000]  strength ropes and all kinds of gear for the military. One thing that people don't realize
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:31.520]  is how deep this goes. And the unfortunate thing is they're using taxpayer dollars to fund all of
[1:28:31.520 --> 1:28:36.480]  this transgenic research. And there is a fight. It's like the nuclear fight that went on years
[1:28:36.480 --> 1:28:42.800]  ago between the USA and Russia. This is going on under the table, and there's a fight in a race
[1:28:43.360 --> 1:28:49.760]  from China, India, United States, and Russia to be able to create these organisms, whether it's
[1:28:49.760 --> 1:28:54.000]  a transgenic fish, whether it's a food, all of these different technologies.
[1:28:54.000 --> 1:29:01.200]  Are cross carbon versus silicon? So it used to be a genetically modified organism,
[1:29:01.200 --> 1:29:07.200]  and what we have now is we have GMO 2.0, and this is not in the mainstream.
[1:29:07.760 --> 1:29:11.200]  And they admit they're now splicing silicon with biological.
[1:29:11.200 --> 1:29:16.880]  What they're doing is called gene silencing or gene editing. And the scary thing about gene
[1:29:16.880 --> 1:29:24.000]  silencing and gene editing is the fact that it doesn't necessarily have to be labeled by the
[1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:29.280]  USDA or the FDA. So let's explain. The general public's told by mainstream pop culture this
[1:29:29.280 --> 1:29:34.480]  doesn't exist. But in all main literature, it's everywhere. Just the stuff they admit is beyond
[1:29:34.480 --> 1:29:37.840]  any science fiction movie you ever heard. I mean, this is like we're in the year 20,
[1:29:38.480 --> 1:29:44.160]  you know, 900 or something. I mean, we're already in the future, folks. We'll be back. Stay with us.
[1:29:47.760 --> 1:29:54.480]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:29:54.480 --> 1:30:02.960]  Hi, I'm the Democratic National Committee. I got hacked by the Russians,
[1:30:02.960 --> 1:30:07.280]  and all my emails got out to the public. I had undercover journalists exposed that I
[1:30:07.280 --> 1:30:13.360]  staged protests and will use violence and cheating to win. I had to fire the head of my committee
[1:30:13.360 --> 1:30:17.520]  because she was incompetent. My presidential candidate had an illegal private server with
[1:30:17.520 --> 1:30:22.000]  classified documents. But when the FBI and the DHS requested access to the materials,
[1:30:22.000 --> 1:30:26.240]  we would not give it to them. That same presidential candidate was married to an
[1:30:26.240 --> 1:30:31.120]  impeached former president who is also a rapist. My last president is also involved as he has
[1:30:31.120 --> 1:30:35.840]  absconded in his hiding documents involved in an investigation into classified information
[1:30:35.840 --> 1:30:40.800]  leaking to the public. I had a tech staffer, processing server, and a federal prosecutor
[1:30:40.800 --> 1:30:45.600]  involved with me all die mysteriously in less than a year. I had multiple members of my party
[1:30:45.600 --> 1:30:53.520]  arrested for pedophilic activity this year. Have I mentioned Trump Russia yet? For infowars.com,
[1:30:53.520 --> 1:31:01.360]  that's the DNC. This is Owen Schreuer. Enjoy all natural bath and beauty products with

[1:31:58.160 --> 1:32:02.000]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in
[1:32:02.000 --> 1:32:06.720]  stock at infowarsstore.com. The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week. I thought it
[1:32:06.720 --> 1:32:10.960]  would be a six-month supply for listeners. And since then, people are beating down our doors,
[1:32:10.960 --> 1:32:15.920]  wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue. Research across the board is clear. In fact,
[1:32:15.920 --> 1:32:20.480]  it's certified. When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute
[1:32:20.480 --> 1:32:25.440]  to blood clots and heart attacks. That's why the Last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns
[1:32:25.440 --> 1:32:30.000]  that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body. Super Blue fluoride-free
[1:32:30.000 --> 1:32:33.840]  toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula. It's loaded with good halogen iodine,
[1:32:33.840 --> 1:32:38.320]  so the bad halogen fluoride. Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used
[1:32:38.320 --> 1:32:43.040]  since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath. Just some of the
[1:32:43.040 --> 1:32:48.480]  ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine,

[1:33:09.120 --> 1:33:19.520]  The Alex Jones Show. Because there is a war on, or your mind.
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:49.520]  Remember in Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark folks where he's running through
[1:33:49.520 --> 1:33:56.160]  the Egyptian town, I guess it's the Tunisian town, looking for the Lost Ark and a big swordsman
[1:33:56.160 --> 1:33:59.120]  comes out and swings the sword around and your radio listener and I'll describe it for you,
[1:33:59.120 --> 1:34:04.720]  but we put Trump's face on Harrison Ford's there. We'll see how singing in likes that.
[1:34:04.720 --> 1:34:09.520]  Now I want to make a statement here and then try to let the group roll for a few minutes.
[1:34:11.040 --> 1:34:19.200]  I have four children. I love them and I talk about things on air that I believe will make
[1:34:19.200 --> 1:34:25.680]  the world a better place. I don't do it from some heroic perspective. I do it from a perspective
[1:34:25.680 --> 1:34:29.280]  of wanting to live in a free society and not wanting to die of cancer.
[1:34:29.280 --> 1:34:37.040]  Dr. Grubs is going to break down how they're having this genetic engineering revolution
[1:34:38.240 --> 1:34:41.840]  and this nanotech revolution without having big debates about it.
[1:34:43.600 --> 1:34:48.880]  And we have a breakaway civilization. So much of it is because the public has been indoctrinated
[1:34:48.880 --> 1:34:56.960]  into sitcoms and drama and sports and people are experts on that. They are not experts on the real
[1:34:56.960 --> 1:35:02.960]  world outside of fantasy land. They kind of go to work, go to church, maybe go to the gym,
[1:35:02.960 --> 1:35:09.760]  maybe go for a hike, go home, watch TV. While you're on a planet, fantastical in deep space,
[1:35:09.760 --> 1:35:14.080]  orbiting a sun, there's meteor showers, there's birds outside your window, you know,
[1:35:14.080 --> 1:35:17.840]  you have your children, you have your neighbors, you have your family, you have this, you know,
[1:35:17.840 --> 1:35:25.360]  the mysteries of consciousness and the globalist want to discover all that. So they've taken
[1:35:25.360 --> 1:35:30.320]  since the days of Eisenhower about 90% of the research money and put it into giant secret
[1:35:30.320 --> 1:35:36.720]  programs. And so all the technology we're given is Trojan Horst and controlled to plug us into
[1:35:36.720 --> 1:35:42.000]  this larger AI synthetic system that is a group consciousness brain that can predict the future
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:46.560]  and control populations. That's Google's own admissions. But that's the silicon system.
[1:35:47.360 --> 1:35:51.920]  You got the carbon based and they are, I mean, I've learned about this 15 years ago,
[1:35:51.920 --> 1:35:55.760]  it's in the news two years ago, they're putting brain shifts in PTSD soldiers now.
[1:35:56.320 --> 1:35:59.280]  They're doing all sorts of secret experimentation, but they're rolling more of it out.
[1:36:00.320 --> 1:36:07.200]  And so again, the animals have rights. The animal rights movements are out there.
[1:36:07.200 --> 1:36:12.000]  Most of them globalist controlled eugenics based systems openly founded by Peter Singer and others.
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:16.160]  That's the godfather of PETA. And then you've got the human rights movements.
[1:36:16.160 --> 1:36:21.760]  But what about all the research labs and the proliferation and something 50 times bigger
[1:36:21.760 --> 1:36:26.880]  than the Manhattan Project going on all around the world, not even in remote areas,
[1:36:27.600 --> 1:36:34.400]  very, very recklessly with gene guns and the CRISPR systems and all these randomly splicing
[1:36:34.400 --> 1:36:40.720]  genes, randomly editing them in real time and then mutagenically injecting them into apes
[1:36:40.720 --> 1:36:46.720]  into human test subjects that sign on for it into gerbils into rats.
[1:36:47.520 --> 1:36:52.800]  So GMO 2.0 genetically modified foods with added health benefits is how the guardian
[1:36:52.800 --> 1:36:57.920]  sells it. We already know the old GMOs, massive cancer increases, stacking genetics,
[1:36:57.920 --> 1:37:02.080]  having them grow their own pesticides, they eat your liver, all of this. I mean,
[1:37:02.080 --> 1:37:04.640]  remember Congress couldn't even regulate the internet because they didn't even know how
[1:37:04.640 --> 1:37:09.040]  it worked 10 years ago. The head senator from Alaska said it was a bunch of tubes
[1:37:09.040 --> 1:37:15.040]  so you've got all these old people like Pelosi and folks that don't understand it.
[1:37:15.040 --> 1:37:18.800]  I just read the literature on the science. It's hard to even understand.
[1:37:19.360 --> 1:37:23.760]  The scientists say most new stuff's being designed by computers with computers, not even humans.
[1:37:23.760 --> 1:37:26.640]  So this is so theoretical now, but it's actually happening.
[1:37:27.440 --> 1:37:32.720]  And so there's this giant no man's land that is the number one threat to humanity.
[1:37:34.240 --> 1:37:38.960]  And the globalists admit this, but they're in this power race for life extension.
[1:37:38.960 --> 1:37:42.480]  They're in this power race with other countries. So whoever gets it first,
[1:37:42.480 --> 1:37:46.000]  they believe will be totally dominant. So a lot of good things are happening in America.
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:50.160]  A lot of good things are happening in the world. A lot of good things are happening and awakening
[1:37:50.160 --> 1:37:57.200]  to globalism and basic facts like that, but not to the nanotech, the cross species and the rest
[1:37:57.200 --> 1:38:02.560]  of it. So we must force a debate about this. Now, Dr. Group, let's run through this. Let's talk
[1:38:02.560 --> 1:38:07.360]  about this. Let's deal with this because when I say we've produced aliens here on earth,
[1:38:07.360 --> 1:38:11.840]  they make jokes about it. But if you cross a human with a pig, if you cross asparagus with
[1:38:11.840 --> 1:38:16.880]  an insect and then put it into a salmon to make it four times larger and they admit is
[1:38:16.880 --> 1:38:22.240]  extinct in regular salmon, and it's just vicious like a piranha. If you do all of this, they can
[1:38:22.240 --> 1:38:28.400]  control it first gen, then it mutates. Every further gen gives rise to viruses, to bacteria
[1:38:28.400 --> 1:38:33.200]  that can now jump species. Notice that allergies are off the charts. All these new gut diseases
[1:38:33.200 --> 1:38:37.440]  are off the charts. Cancer's off the chart. I mean, we're being killed by this right now.
[1:38:37.440 --> 1:38:41.520]  They're already making it where almost everybody's sterile, so you've got to go in and have genetic
[1:38:41.520 --> 1:38:46.480]  engineering so you can even have a child, but they admit it's not really a human. It's going to be
[1:38:46.480 --> 1:38:52.320]  designed by the techs. So if you think your smartphone is a Trojan horse, that's 50-year-old
[1:38:52.320 --> 1:38:57.360]  technology that was deployed to you the slaves. They're now ready to start deploying the next gen,
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:02.240]  but first they've got to confuse you and say it's the right to be a woman if you think you're a man,
[1:39:02.240 --> 1:39:06.720]  or it's the right to be a dog if you want, or it's the right to get you all confused with hundreds
[1:39:06.720 --> 1:39:12.720]  of genders, getting you ready for the true trans humans. That is their plan, and if you want to do
[1:39:12.720 --> 1:39:17.360]  it, that's your issue. But what about the ethics and what about how it affects the rest of us?
[1:39:17.360 --> 1:39:21.520]  The new diseases this will give rise to, but they're only giving a step they've already had for
[1:39:21.520 --> 1:39:26.960]  decades. They've already got cures to global crises. This is going to create, but you'll have to give
[1:39:26.960 --> 1:39:32.880]  up more humanity for each new patch for the genetic nightmares they create. This is their
[1:39:32.880 --> 1:39:37.040]  master plan. Dr. Grip, please give a presentation. Well, Columbia University actually did a study
[1:39:37.040 --> 1:39:44.480]  on CRISPR and gene splicing technology, and they said that there can be hundreds of mutations formed,
[1:39:44.480 --> 1:39:48.400]  and the only reason we present all this information out here, Alex, is just to try to
[1:39:48.400 --> 1:39:56.240]  give people the information so they can be aware. Please try not to eat genetically modified
[1:39:56.240 --> 1:40:01.920]  organisms and do your own research. We've been genetically modified, believe it or not,
[1:40:01.920 --> 1:40:06.800]  for the last hundred years. When you look at the genetics and epigenetics and how fluoride
[1:40:06.800 --> 1:40:12.320]  affects our genes and how stress affects our genes, and I mean, they're using viral DNA and
[1:40:12.320 --> 1:40:20.240]  flu shots and in vaccinations. So we're already being slowly introduced and changed. See, the way
[1:40:20.240 --> 1:40:27.120]  that this whole shadow government or this shadow transgenics program works is they can't just do
[1:40:27.120 --> 1:40:30.800]  it all at once. I mean, they can't say, oh, come on, come in and line up, and we're just going to
[1:40:30.800 --> 1:40:36.400]  give you an injection and slowly change you. They're slowly changing this over a long period of time.
[1:40:36.400 --> 1:40:41.120]  First of all, they're going to start with using animal DNA to make soldiers strong. Then they're
[1:40:41.120 --> 1:40:47.120]  going to start changing and altering the plants that we eat. So it's agricultural, big agricultural
[1:40:47.120 --> 1:40:58.400]  genetic processes. Then it's big pharmaceutical crops. Then it's humans. And nobody is addressing
[1:40:58.400 --> 1:41:05.120]  the root cause of the problem out there, which is all of these individual things that are causing
[1:41:05.120 --> 1:41:08.240]  all of our diseases and causing all of our symptoms. And the globalists admit, though,
[1:41:08.240 --> 1:41:12.640]  they're going to make being human ugly and impossible to fully take control of the entire
[1:41:12.640 --> 1:41:18.800]  genome of the planet. What they're trying to do is control all life. That means plant life.
[1:41:18.800 --> 1:41:25.200]  So they own the patents for every single plant. They own all of the patents for this gene technology.
[1:41:25.200 --> 1:41:28.960]  Like you said, the future, and this is, you could bring this up. This sounds like a very
[1:41:28.960 --> 1:41:34.000]  sophisticated alien takeover. And I'm not saying it is, but the globalists are breakaway psychotics.
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:39.200]  This is what they're building. But the good news is there's easy ways to avoid it and
[1:41:39.200 --> 1:41:44.320]  Monsanto cut the deal with CRISPR. Tell folks about that. So Monsanto, yeah, Monsanto just signed
[1:41:44.320 --> 1:41:48.480]  a deal for CRISPR technology, which was developed by the Broad Institute in Boston. And that,
[1:41:48.480 --> 1:41:54.000]  that's a whole nother story with who funds all that. Cold Springs Harbor. So, uh, so the CRISPR
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:58.640]  technology is a gene editing tool where you can go in and edit the genes for, you know, and they're,
[1:41:58.640 --> 1:42:04.880]  they're saying that it's going to be used for autism, Alzheimer's disease, cancer. If you can go
[1:42:04.880 --> 1:42:09.920]  in and edit those, the P 53 gene, then you can get rid of disease. And again, they give you the
[1:42:09.920 --> 1:42:13.920]  mercury, they give you the adjuvants. Yes, you're predisposed genetically, if you're male, if you
[1:42:13.920 --> 1:42:18.400]  have those genetics for it to cause an autoimmune response in the brain and the gut. So they claim
[1:42:18.400 --> 1:42:23.360]  they're going to just turn off the gene so that now the vaccine itself doesn't hurt. They want,
[1:42:23.360 --> 1:42:30.960]  and this is happening, they want sterility. And it's really what it is, is it's a mass attack
[1:42:30.960 --> 1:42:37.280]  on males especially. We're just getting neutered, basically, with all the, the endocrine disrupting
[1:42:37.280 --> 1:42:41.840]  chemicals in the water supply, all the contraceptives in the water supply. And they admit they're
[1:42:41.840 --> 1:42:45.920]  doing it just like they admit they're killing the west of Christianity. All of this stuff is
[1:42:45.920 --> 1:42:49.600]  available. What gets me is I tell people, you know, they argue with me all the time to say,
[1:42:49.600 --> 1:42:55.440]  what about all this? Do you understand? It's an admitted battle plan to end Christianity and
[1:42:55.440 --> 1:43:01.120]  wipe white people out Atlantic monthly. So the secret societies, and if you want to say the
[1:43:01.120 --> 1:43:06.160]  Illuminati's or if you want to say the globalists, the top few that are in to,
[1:43:07.920 --> 1:43:16.160]  that are the ones behind all of these toxic genetic disease causing methods that are introduced,
[1:43:16.160 --> 1:43:20.240]  whether it's from the air, whether it's from the water, whether it's from the food supply,
[1:43:20.240 --> 1:43:25.120]  they actually design it to where they want you to go out and eat in restaurants and not
[1:43:25.120 --> 1:43:28.400]  grow your own food and not cook your own food. And they want to get rid of all that.
[1:43:28.400 --> 1:43:32.480]  They're taking control of the normal human paradigm of being on top of your food,
[1:43:32.480 --> 1:43:36.720]  killing your own food, living there. They're training you to be totally domesticated.
[1:43:36.720 --> 1:43:42.640]  The seed vaults is the third heavily, most heavily guarded structure in the world.
[1:43:42.640 --> 1:43:44.960]  And who funds that, the UN and the Rockefellers?
[1:43:44.960 --> 1:43:50.640]  And the Bill Gates Foundation and Monsanto's part of it in Singenta. And as a matter of fact,
[1:43:50.640 --> 1:43:55.440]  Singenta was just bought by a Chinese company. Now, that's a scary thought.
[1:43:55.440 --> 1:44:02.000]  Singenta is the agricultural big producer of atrazine and also genetically modified crops who
[1:44:02.000 --> 1:44:06.400]  makes billions upon billions of billions of dollars every single year, just like Monsanto is.
[1:44:06.400 --> 1:44:09.920]  And China has been signed on to the eugenics program with the globalist.
[1:44:10.800 --> 1:44:16.080]  That's right. Now, let me tell you how easy it is to fix your genes because we know that
[1:44:16.080 --> 1:44:22.320]  all of these things are gene altering substances, but the body is smart and you still do have stem
[1:44:22.320 --> 1:44:26.720]  cells. And that's why I explain it to them. This is the big secret the elites are doing.
[1:44:26.720 --> 1:44:30.560]  This is the big breakthrough. Tell them. Well, the big thing is not really big.
[1:44:30.560 --> 1:44:35.840]  It's been used for thousands of years and it's fasting. It's why individuals dating back in
[1:44:35.840 --> 1:44:41.840]  the Bible, they would fast for 40 days and you can regenerate yourselves. USC just came out with
[1:44:41.840 --> 1:44:49.280]  the with groundbreaking research that a 72 hour water fast, you actually start producing stem
[1:44:49.280 --> 1:44:54.960]  cells and you regenerate your immune system in 72 hours. That's why children, when they're sick,
[1:44:54.960 --> 1:44:58.400]  explain it. That's why you're not supposed to eat. It's when a baby's first born,
[1:44:58.400 --> 1:45:02.560]  they're not supposed to get real milk. Only cost from a few days is to activate even more of
[1:45:02.560 --> 1:45:07.920]  their cells. Exactly. So we have the solution inside our own bodies and it's going to be with
[1:45:07.920 --> 1:45:12.080]  fasting. I'm coming out with a whole new book on fasting. You can see intermittent fasting,
[1:45:12.080 --> 1:45:16.240]  how it's just doing tremendous things for people all over the world right now.
[1:45:17.120 --> 1:45:19.600]  But explain what you were saying to me before the show because I mean, I know it's in the
[1:45:19.600 --> 1:45:23.360]  medical literature, but just hearing it. I mean, you look five years younger and you look great.
[1:45:23.360 --> 1:45:26.800]  You've been fasting intermittent fasting. You're about to do an 18 day fast.
[1:45:26.800 --> 1:45:28.800]  Explain what happens when you start fasting?
[1:45:29.520 --> 1:45:33.840]  Well, it's a little bit hard, but what happens is eventually after about day four,
[1:45:33.840 --> 1:45:38.160]  and this is medical research. I'm not just making this up. It's called autophagy.
[1:45:38.160 --> 1:45:40.960]  We're showing even mainline science publications off screen. Let's put it back up.
[1:45:40.960 --> 1:45:44.800]  So autophagy means where your body actually goes into a phase.
[1:45:44.800 --> 1:45:48.720]  There it is. USC news. Fasting like diet turns the immune system against cancer.
[1:45:48.720 --> 1:45:52.320]  That's right. You were saying it literally doesn't just eat tumors. It eats old scars
[1:45:52.320 --> 1:45:58.080]  internally. So I've done so much research and interviewed people that have been fasting and
[1:45:58.080 --> 1:46:03.600]  looked back at the books and actually found out that the majority of doctors that were using
[1:46:03.600 --> 1:46:09.120]  fasting programs from the late 1800s all the way through the 1950s, their books were banned,
[1:46:09.120 --> 1:46:12.400]  their books were burned. It's extremely hard to find.
[1:46:12.400 --> 1:46:15.440]  Well, look at the old testament. I mean, the people are ordered to fast.
[1:46:15.440 --> 1:46:20.480]  Right. Thousands upon thousands of cases of every single disease take cancer for existence.
[1:46:20.480 --> 1:46:23.840]  And by the way, I'm not making any medical claims and saying fasts for everybody to run
[1:46:23.840 --> 1:46:28.800]  out and start fasting, but cancer feeds on glucose. Now, what happens when you start
[1:46:28.800 --> 1:46:33.040]  fasting is after about four days on water, your digestive system shuts down.
[1:46:33.040 --> 1:46:37.680]  Now, do you know, Alex, that one of the biggest, we've talked about this all the time is, is
[1:46:37.680 --> 1:46:45.200]  digestive issues, digestive issues. Do you know that one meal a day can take up to 24 to 72 hours
[1:46:45.200 --> 1:46:50.880]  to break down? That's one meal a day. How many meals are people eating right now cooked meals,
[1:46:50.880 --> 1:46:56.320]  bad meals, three, four or five meals a day? So basically your body's energy stores are having
[1:46:56.320 --> 1:47:02.400]  to work nonstop to take and digest the food. So when you take food completely out of the system
[1:47:02.400 --> 1:47:07.680]  and you start going on water by itself, the digestive system shuts down in about two or
[1:47:07.680 --> 1:47:12.800]  three days, depending on how, you know, everybody's different. And then the focus of your body is to
[1:47:12.800 --> 1:47:18.080]  start healing itself and your body will start using your fat stores for energy. That's kind of
[1:47:18.080 --> 1:47:22.800]  like the ketogenic diets that people are doing right now. So your body goes into ketosis. It
[1:47:22.800 --> 1:47:27.920]  starts chewing up, rapidly chewing up fat stores. A lot of the chemicals and toxins are stored in
[1:47:27.920 --> 1:47:33.040]  the fat tissue. Stem cells are stored in the fat tissue. There's a clinic in Thailand right now,
[1:47:33.040 --> 1:47:40.000]  Dr. Richard DeAndrea, who's making great success using your own stem cells that he's getting from
[1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:46.560]  the umbilical. So you can start producing these stem cells that will heal and regenerate your
[1:47:46.560 --> 1:47:52.320]  tissues. And so autophagy, the body will start chewing up abnormal tissue. People that have scars
[1:47:52.320 --> 1:47:57.040]  all the way down their arms or their legs gone completely when the body starts chewing all that
[1:47:57.040 --> 1:48:02.400]  up. Organ problems. The body starts regenerating the organ, starts producing all these stem cells
[1:48:02.400 --> 1:48:09.040]  again. Amazing that all we need, when you look at medicine out there and all of the natural
[1:48:09.040 --> 1:48:14.160]  medicine out there, that's why we've been such a big fan of cleansing the body, avoiding all the
[1:48:14.160 --> 1:48:18.480]  chemicals that are going to cause epigenetic changes in the system that are going to cause disease.
[1:48:19.360 --> 1:48:23.200]  Well, you're involved with the TV production and you're going to have a book soon. I know this is
[1:48:23.200 --> 1:48:27.120]  in the main line of literature. It doesn't mean I've actually acted on much of this. I am more
[1:48:27.120 --> 1:48:32.160]  and more acting on it because it's the only way, just like you go into a fever or you fast to get
[1:48:32.160 --> 1:48:37.840]  rid of a virus or bacteria, you do the intermittent fasting or you, you know, don't eat anytime but
[1:48:37.840 --> 1:48:44.800]  say noon until six at night. As you know, the studies show absolutely makes your body work so
[1:48:44.800 --> 1:48:49.520]  much better. It's a fact as long as you're getting high nutrient dense meals. Now I plugged like one
[1:48:49.520 --> 1:48:54.800]  minute last hour and I've got to plug some this hour. This is a separate issue. The media loves
[1:48:54.800 --> 1:48:59.200]  to attack probiotics when we sell it. They're even attacking me selling coffee saying coffee's a scam.
[1:48:59.200 --> 1:49:03.920]  The coffee doesn't actually make you wake up or, I'm not kidding, D Magazine and others said that
[1:49:03.920 --> 1:49:07.760]  I'm a scammer for selling coffee, high quality coffee. Okay, cooks, we're not allowed to sell
[1:49:07.760 --> 1:49:14.240]  anything. Only big corporate media. But Myco ZX is back in stock. It's hard ingredients to get.
[1:49:14.240 --> 1:49:17.120]  I'm going to skip this break so we have more time. It's been sold out for,
[1:49:17.120 --> 1:49:22.560]  I don't know, four or five months. It comes with a biome defense probiotic. Tell us about both these
[1:49:22.560 --> 1:49:30.080]  products you develop exclusively for infowarslife.com and again, not some panacea but what probiotics do,
[1:49:30.080 --> 1:49:36.240]  why they're needed and then why Myco ZX is the anti-fungal, anti-yeast probiotic and why that
[1:49:36.240 --> 1:49:40.880]  gets into the whole missing link that normal probiotics aren't covering because this is,
[1:49:40.880 --> 1:49:43.840]  I mean, I've got so many people that I know personally that have irritable bowel,
[1:49:43.840 --> 1:49:48.960]  Crohn's type stuff and they finally start taking probiotics and it made it a lot better or
[1:49:48.960 --> 1:49:54.240]  completely better. Some, though, not completely better. They took Myco ZX and we'll go read the
[1:49:54.240 --> 1:49:59.600]  third party reviews at infowarslife.com. This is life changing for many people. Just experience
[1:49:59.600 --> 1:50:06.240]  it yourself. The toxins, the GMO, the pesticides, the herbicides, the runoff, it gets into your
[1:50:06.240 --> 1:50:11.280]  gut, it's the front line and it kills the good bacteria basically and then all these really
[1:50:11.280 --> 1:50:17.360]  toxic invaders move in. Those spaces, the fungus creates the slime walls, spend some time on this
[1:50:17.360 --> 1:50:23.760]  Dr. Group. Well, first of all, only about one out of every 50 of those reviews that come in,
[1:50:23.760 --> 1:50:30.000]  we can actually post online because of the claims that people are making and the incredible
[1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  differences. Even though it's their free speech, the free speech has been hurt so bad in America,
[1:50:34.800 --> 1:50:39.760]  most of these we can't even show you. So it all starts in the gut and hopefully all your listeners
[1:50:39.760 --> 1:50:44.080]  know that by now. We've been talking. Bill Gates is obsessed with it. We've been saying it for 20
[1:50:44.080 --> 1:50:49.760]  years when we were originally on a research team trying to develop and find and present the root
[1:50:49.760 --> 1:50:55.840]  cause of all disease, which we did. And it all, health begins in the gut as well as disease begins
[1:50:55.840 --> 1:51:03.280]  in the gut. And when your gut is unhealthy, every system in your body becomes depressed.
[1:51:03.280 --> 1:51:09.280]  Your cardiovascular system, your mental acuity, the way that you think, the way that your immune
[1:51:09.280 --> 1:51:14.240]  system works, everything is linked to the gut. So when we started developing these products,
[1:51:14.240 --> 1:51:20.880]  we started looking at what is the, what is coming in? And we found that the standard American diet,
[1:51:20.880 --> 1:51:26.400]  the gluten, the genetically modified foods, all the chemicals, heavy metals were destroying
[1:51:26.400 --> 1:51:33.680]  the natural probiotics. And pretty much everybody out there had very little of the good probiotics.
[1:51:33.680 --> 1:51:40.720]  What they had was they had overgrowth of the bad organisms in their bow, which is the candida
[1:51:40.720 --> 1:51:44.800]  and different types of bacteria. And this has gone from being a conspiracy theory. 20 years ago,
[1:51:44.800 --> 1:51:51.680]  to mainline science, people even get fecal bacteria transfusions now because their guts are so dead.
[1:51:51.680 --> 1:51:58.880]  Right. And one of the, talking about transhumanism and being able to manipulate the genes is
[1:51:58.880 --> 1:52:03.920]  they're doing it through the gut. They're doing it because that's how you get into the bloodstream.
[1:52:03.920 --> 1:52:10.720]  You can literally tag things now with organisms and genetically modified in the BT toxin, for example,
[1:52:10.720 --> 1:52:15.680]  and they can alter the genetic code. Again, for those that don't know, BT toxin, the plant grows
[1:52:15.680 --> 1:52:20.640]  its own pesticide, then you eat it. No wonder your liver's dying. But you know, the good thing is,
[1:52:20.640 --> 1:52:25.120]  there's always a positive and a negative, but the positive is the body heals extremely fast.
[1:52:25.120 --> 1:52:29.600]  When you just avoid all these things and you have to take a good probiotic,
[1:52:29.600 --> 1:52:33.840]  when we were, it took us like seven to 10 years to develop the biome defense because
[1:52:33.840 --> 1:52:37.600]  we looked at every single pro... For five years, I was saying, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up. This is
[1:52:37.600 --> 1:52:43.680]  the... Exactly. This isn't hype. What we're explaining here is most people have no real gut
[1:52:43.680 --> 1:52:48.240]  flora left because of all the toxins. You have to continually replace it now. And it has made my
[1:52:48.240 --> 1:52:52.720]  life and everybody else in my life, people roll their eyes who have irritable bowel. You know,
[1:52:52.720 --> 1:52:57.920]  I go, I go, hey, take this in two weeks or like, it's all over. I mean, it's incredible.
[1:52:58.560 --> 1:53:05.840]  Namely, one person that's got any benefit or their any gut disorder that they've had has gone away
[1:53:05.840 --> 1:53:12.240]  by going the allopathic route. Zero. They're put on medications, their bowel condition worsens,
[1:53:12.240 --> 1:53:18.640]  the medical profession doesn't tell them... But your gut operates off bacteria in every species.
[1:53:18.640 --> 1:53:22.560]  It's the bacteria in cows and humans and cats and everything, no matter what type of stomach
[1:53:22.560 --> 1:53:27.280]  you've got, our intestines, it's always bacteria. That's a fact. But they call it a conspiracy.
[1:53:27.280 --> 1:53:30.800]  There doesn't matter. You've got degrees from MIT and everywhere else and a bunch of other
[1:53:30.800 --> 1:53:34.800]  degrees. The media makes fun of you and says that you're an idiot. That's right. I mean,
[1:53:34.800 --> 1:53:39.440]  literally, they say we cannot sell coffee. It's a fraud. That's right. That's right. I've been a
[1:53:39.440 --> 1:53:45.440]  research scientist for a long time. I do have... I am MIT alumni and I can tell you that I do
[1:53:45.440 --> 1:53:51.040]  research all the time and I want the best. And Alex, anybody, any of your listeners or anybody
[1:53:51.040 --> 1:53:56.480]  in the mainstream media that's watching this, you can go to any other probiotic company right now
[1:53:56.480 --> 1:54:02.400]  and you can ask them if their probiotics have maltodextrin, silicon dioxide, and all those toxic
[1:54:02.400 --> 1:54:08.400]  fillers and excipients that they're not required to list on the label because they're under 1%.
[1:54:10.080 --> 1:54:14.640]  We did that and I did that. I wanted to develop a probiotic and I found out that all of these
[1:54:14.640 --> 1:54:18.320]  things are cultured on genetically modified maltodextrin and all these other fillers and
[1:54:18.320 --> 1:54:22.880]  excipients and everything. I went to the... There's only like five or six main huge...
[1:54:22.880 --> 1:54:27.360]  You went to Europe because we knew it'd be a best seller. I mean, when I met you five years ago,
[1:54:27.360 --> 1:54:30.320]  you were trying to develop this. Yeah, and they didn't want to work with me. They laughed in my
[1:54:30.320 --> 1:54:34.880]  face and they said, oh, yeah, we're not going to... Oh, no, you can buy our probiotics individually by
[1:54:34.880 --> 1:54:38.880]  the ton or you can buy them by the kilos, but they're going to come with the silicon dioxide.
[1:54:38.880 --> 1:54:42.560]  They're going to come with the magnetic... But now the new hot thing in Europe has the...
[1:54:42.560 --> 1:54:44.880]  They're starting to have these at clinics, though, that are the way you want them.
[1:54:44.880 --> 1:54:50.400]  Well, that's right. I mean, we're the first company in the United States to produce a
[1:54:50.400 --> 1:54:54.160]  probiotic formula with none of those fillers. And see, we don't even hype how good this is.
[1:54:54.160 --> 1:54:57.280]  So people know biome defense is the very best way lower than stuff. You even get
[1:54:57.280 --> 1:55:02.320]  at expensive clinics. It's 30% off when you get it with MycoZX. Now tell folks about the MycoZX
[1:55:02.320 --> 1:55:06.960]  because the probiotic just goes in and displaces what the bad bacteria and has the healthy flora,
[1:55:06.960 --> 1:55:13.360]  but what does the MycoZX do? Vision problems, running rampant, skin problems, running rampant
[1:55:13.360 --> 1:55:20.400]  right now. Children, every single child below 10 is suffering from something. I personally have not
[1:55:20.400 --> 1:55:26.160]  had someone tell me, except maybe an organic child, that they're not suffering from allergies or some
[1:55:26.160 --> 1:55:30.960]  sort of toxins right now. That's exploding. Have you had fungus? Just search engine, man dies from
[1:55:30.960 --> 1:55:35.680]  fungus. Woman dies of fungus. Brain tumors were... I know a bunch of people who suddenly have family
[1:55:35.680 --> 1:55:40.800]  with brain tumors that's fungus in the brain. Right now, people are dying from fungus. Because
[1:55:40.800 --> 1:55:46.160]  of Candida auris right now. Fungus, yeast. Why is it exploding? Why is it suddenly just
[1:55:46.160 --> 1:55:53.840]  growing everywhere? I have a couple theories. Number one is our biological terrain has changed.
[1:55:53.840 --> 1:55:58.800]  We've become acidic. The foods are changing. The soil is changing. That's why you're seeing,
[1:55:59.360 --> 1:56:03.760]  you know, when you look at organisms like Louis Pasteur said on his deathbed, he said the germ
[1:56:03.760 --> 1:56:08.800]  is nothing. The terrain is everything, right? Because we had the germ theory a long time ago
[1:56:08.800 --> 1:56:13.600]  and we used to think that germs cause disease. Well, that's wrong. It's not the germ, the environment,
[1:56:13.600 --> 1:56:18.480]  the rain and the environment in which the germ can live. If you look at the poisoning of the air
[1:56:18.480 --> 1:56:22.560]  that's happened, the poisoning of the water that's happened, the poisoning of the food supply that's
[1:56:22.560 --> 1:56:27.440]  happened, it's a chain reaction plus all these artificial buildings to grow in. These fungus and
[1:56:27.440 --> 1:56:34.560]  mold and yeast and bacteria, they thrive in these very acidic toxic environments. Look, just don't
[1:56:34.560 --> 1:56:38.480]  wash your dishes in your kitchen for a week and just let them sit there and see what grows on.
[1:56:38.480 --> 1:56:44.000]  It's mold. It's not even the bacteria. It's the fungus and again, folks, Myco ZX, the latest level
[1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:48.800]  of probiotic. It's got all these key herbs and compounds that are absolutely changing people's
[1:56:48.800 --> 1:56:52.800]  lives and it supports the broadcast. It's a win-win-win. Don't let the media tell you the gut
[1:56:52.800 --> 1:56:56.080]  isn't important. Don't let them tell you that probiotics aren't important. I guarantee you,
[1:56:56.080 --> 1:57:00.560]  most of those CNN and Washington Post people attacking us, they're taking our products. We know
[1:57:00.560 --> 1:57:05.760]  and let's expand on that. Bezos owns whole foods that sell stuff that isn't even as good as this.
[1:57:05.760 --> 1:57:10.640]  They don't want us to be able to fund ourselves. Infowarslife.com or triple eight, two, five,
[1:57:10.640 --> 1:57:15.040]  three, three, one, three, nine free shipping. A lot of other specials. Infowarslife.com or
[1:57:15.040 --> 1:57:19.600]  triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. Briefly, tell folks what's in Myco ZX.
[1:57:19.600 --> 1:57:25.520]  Myco ZX has a unique blend of herbs that have been proven effective for a long period of time
[1:57:26.080 --> 1:57:34.240]  to target the external lining of multifaceted different types of fungus and mold and not
[1:57:34.240 --> 1:57:38.800]  because they take your gut over and create a slime oil. So it's called a biofilm and they
[1:57:38.800 --> 1:57:43.760]  create a biofilm and you have to actually break that biofilm down. They start farming in there
[1:57:43.760 --> 1:57:47.200]  and they start farming and a lot of that also depends on what you're, you know, when you,
[1:57:47.200 --> 1:57:51.840]  when you take in a lot of high fructose corn syrup and you change the, you take it. Everybody's
[1:57:51.840 --> 1:57:55.840]  seen mold growing in the attic or growing under the, or cold dark places or warm places.
[1:57:55.840 --> 1:58:01.520]  That's what's growing in the guts. That's, you know, you've got to knock it out. If you, if people
[1:58:01.520 --> 1:58:06.000]  had a microscope that they could just turn on of what's going on in their gut right now, they would
[1:58:06.000 --> 1:58:11.280]  be sick and most of the people out there, because when you put high fructose corn syrup, then you
[1:58:11.280 --> 1:58:14.960]  put gluten, then you put genetically modified foods and then you look at all the yeast over
[1:58:14.960 --> 1:58:19.280]  growth and the mold and all of the different compounds. No wonder your immune systems whacked
[1:58:19.280 --> 1:58:23.600]  out. That's why you're getting, you're sick. That's why you're low in energy. That's why
[1:58:24.560 --> 1:58:30.240]  you need to take. Because your engine is, your engine's being fed crap. Exactly. So this is like
[1:58:30.240 --> 1:58:36.080]  STP fuel additive, basically. InfowarsLive.com helps support the broadcast second hour, third hour,
[1:58:36.080 --> 1:58:40.320]  tons of news coming up with Dr. Group, another special guest. Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.

[1:59:42.320 --> 1:59:53.760]  so please take advantage of it today, support your own health, and support the infowar.
[2:00:12.720 --> 2:00:17.680]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[2:00:19.280 --> 2:00:24.560]  And Dr. Groot, you know, let's play one more of these memes. Here's one again that Rob
[2:00:24.560 --> 2:00:48.160]  do just put out brand new, bored into the world. Here it is. We've got some good compilation
[2:00:48.160 --> 2:00:52.480]  ones. I know Darren put one together that will come out of the next segment and play two of them
[2:00:52.480 --> 2:00:58.960]  together, one that Ian Harrison put together. We have a $20,000 prize going out of the CNN's
[2:00:58.960 --> 2:01:04.080]  terror, CNN's fake news pool. It wasn't going to be $2,500 prizes, but I'm now having a $20,000
[2:01:04.080 --> 2:01:08.640]  prize for the best meme that promotes infowars and what we're doing here, but obviously Trump
[2:01:08.640 --> 2:01:15.840]  destroying CNN or other MSM. You know what? Let's widen the field. How bad of a backlash was that?
[2:01:15.840 --> 2:01:19.600]  I mean, how bad? They don't know the season they're in. And that's what's incredible about humans.
[2:01:19.600 --> 2:01:26.720]  People ask me, why are you so crazy? Why do you get so upset? My new daughter is the most beautiful
[2:01:26.720 --> 2:01:33.920]  creature I've ever seen in my life. I'm in love with her and she's an angel. And I mean, I'm sitting
[2:01:33.920 --> 2:01:37.440]  there looking at her and I'm like, I'm going to fight harder. I'm going to be stronger. I'm going
[2:01:37.440 --> 2:01:41.920]  to get healthier. I'm going to be even more focused to build a better world for her and the people
[2:01:41.920 --> 2:01:45.760]  she's going to live with in the future. Because if I love her, I love you and everybody else.
[2:01:45.760 --> 2:01:50.320]  And they know Gardasil's the Sterilent. They're giving it to all the Hispanics in Mexico. Where's
[2:01:50.320 --> 2:01:54.560]  Laraza and Mecha? Oh, well, they're overpopulated. Kill them. No, I don't want them coming here
[2:01:54.560 --> 2:01:59.360]  to be illegals and be my enemy. I want them to be free and prosperous and Mexico will be so nice.
[2:01:59.360 --> 2:02:04.640]  They move here, I move there. But again, I am in a death battle. People ask how I have this much
[2:02:04.640 --> 2:02:09.120]  energy. Megan Kelly asked me what drugs I was on. And I said, I don't use drugs. She was kind of like,
[2:02:09.120 --> 2:02:11.760]  really, you don't. I don't know what that meant, but I thought she was trying to like get me into
[2:02:11.760 --> 2:02:17.840]  saying I was on drugs. Folks, I have hundreds of articles I see every week about human animal
[2:02:17.840 --> 2:02:22.160]  chimeras with no rights. You talked about people you know in research labs. I've talked to them too.
[2:02:22.160 --> 2:02:28.400]  You see humanoids, they're like 80% gorilla, 80% pig, and they're talking. And this is highly,
[2:02:28.400 --> 2:02:38.000]  go ahead. Case law school in 2006 was hired to develop law for the future of transgenic
[2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:43.600]  organisms. And they're already here and we're saying we want to force a debate. What rights are
[2:02:43.600 --> 2:02:49.200]  they going to, like, do you get rights as a human if you have 50% DNA? Like, what are the rights that
[2:02:49.200 --> 2:02:53.760]  are going to be? We need to make this illegal. This needs to be illegal. It needs to be. They're
[2:02:53.760 --> 2:03:01.120]  talking about making it illegal to make child pedophile robots. Okay. Okay. You know, make
[2:03:01.120 --> 2:03:07.120]  that illegal. But what about the human splice with animals? I mean, this is beyond pedophilia.
[2:03:07.120 --> 2:03:14.960]  Why is this illegal? Why is glyphosate legal? Why grows cancer? Undebated that glyphosate grows
[2:03:14.960 --> 2:03:20.320]  cancer. You want to make the big miracle grow for cancer. Exactly. To health, the healthcare system,
[2:03:20.320 --> 2:03:24.880]  you want to like, look, this is ridiculous. The healthcare system, all this stuff, it's a bailout.
[2:03:24.880 --> 2:03:29.280]  They're giving the insurance companies billions of dollars address the root cause of the problem.
[2:03:29.280 --> 2:03:36.400]  Executive order ban glyphosate, executive order ban GMOs, executive order ban artificial sweeteners,
[2:03:36.400 --> 2:03:41.600]  manmade chemicals and products, phthalates. You know what? You know the root cause of why we're
[2:03:41.600 --> 2:03:46.000]  getting all this disease. I love my, I love my children. We've got to stop this group. We've
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:50.160]  got to do it. But again, they want to make jokes about it. I mean, it's like the gay frog thing.
[2:03:50.160 --> 2:03:53.600]  20 something years, it's they've admitted that they've got that most of the frogs and amphibians
[2:03:53.600 --> 2:03:58.320]  and fish are dying. They've got they're terribly deformed. And then it's just a big joke to Colbert.
[2:03:58.320 --> 2:04:02.400]  I notice all his attacks make fun of us and how our genetics are being manipulated. They want to
[2:04:02.400 --> 2:04:07.520]  make a joke about that with the public so no one cares. There was an article that came out either
[2:04:07.520 --> 2:04:14.400]  today or yesterday that I saw one fifth of all fish are showing transgenic traits right now.
[2:04:14.400 --> 2:04:19.600]  You have male fish. It's actually 80, 84% of smallmouth bass. Yeah, across the board,
[2:04:19.600 --> 2:04:25.120]  the one fifth. You're right. Because there's that much of the contraceptives being being flushed
[2:04:25.120 --> 2:04:29.600]  down the toilet. And that's just one thing. That's just one thing. I mean, you know, but let's expand
[2:04:29.600 --> 2:04:34.880]  on that then. Again, it grows all these cancers. It's doing all this is causing us to be infertile.
[2:04:36.400 --> 2:04:40.400]  And then they can come on the back end with their gene splicing technology and get rid of it until
[2:04:40.400 --> 2:04:44.080]  you get the next disease. And then you're going to have to pay for the gene splicing technology to
[2:04:44.080 --> 2:04:48.320]  get here. It's crazy. And then you're going to have a thousand mutations from each gene splicing
[2:04:48.320 --> 2:04:53.440]  thing. So Monsanto 1000 new opportunities admits their plans to take over. My God, see,
[2:04:53.440 --> 2:05:00.240]  it we're not even theorizing what a nightmare. We've got to stop it. Hi, I'm the Democratic
[2:05:00.240 --> 2:05:05.680]  National Committee. I got hacked by the Russians and all my emails got out to the public. I had
[2:05:05.680 --> 2:05:10.480]  undercover journalists exposed that I staged protests and will use violence and cheating to win.
[2:05:11.360 --> 2:05:16.000]  I had to fire the head of my committee because she was incompetent. My presidential candidate
[2:05:16.000 --> 2:05:20.720]  had an illegal private server with classified documents. But when the FBI and the DHS requested
[2:05:20.720 --> 2:05:25.840]  access to the materials, we would not give it to them. That same presidential candidate was married
[2:05:25.840 --> 2:05:30.480]  to an impeached former president who is also a rapist. My last president is also involved,
[2:05:30.480 --> 2:05:35.120]  as he has absconded in his hiding documents involved in an investigation into classified
[2:05:35.120 --> 2:05:40.640]  information leaking to the public. I had a tech staffer, processing server, and a federal prosecutor
[2:05:40.640 --> 2:05:45.520]  involved with me all die mysteriously in less than a year. I had multiple members of my party
[2:05:45.520 --> 2:05:50.720]  arrested for pedophilic activity this year. Have I mentioned Trump Russia yet?
[2:05:51.760 --> 2:05:55.680]  For infowars.com, that's the DNC. This is Owen Schreuer.
[2:05:59.680 --> 2:06:05.280]  MycoZX is back in after five plus months sold out. Talk about next level probiotic. It's the
[2:06:05.280 --> 2:06:10.880]  antifungus, anti yeast, latest technology of 4.8 stars. It's been sold out for months, big waiting
[2:06:10.880 --> 2:06:15.120]  list, limited amount because it's so hard to get the compounds and have any California standards.

[2:06:40.080 --> 2:06:44.000]  embarrassing to get family and crew members on that, you know, have herbal bow and Crohn's type
[2:06:44.000 --> 2:06:47.280]  stuff didn't exist years ago. Now it's epidemic, but I'm getting ready to have a bunch of folks
[2:06:47.280 --> 2:06:50.320]  go ahead and come on here and tell you what it did for them because regardless, you can't lose

[2:07:53.120 --> 2:08:07.120]  to learn more. Let's infowarsstore.com. I'd like to share a revelation that I've had during my time
[2:08:07.120 --> 2:08:16.000]  here. It came to me when I tried to classify your species and I realized that you're not actually
[2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:25.040]  mammals. Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding
[2:08:25.040 --> 2:08:33.840]  environment but you humans do not. You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every
[2:08:33.840 --> 2:08:48.000]  natural resource is consumed. The only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is
[2:08:48.000 --> 2:08:56.320]  another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus.
[2:08:56.320 --> 2:09:08.880]  Human beings are a disease. A cancer of this planet. Your plague. We are the cure.
[2:09:14.240 --> 2:09:20.080]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[2:09:20.080 --> 2:09:27.120]  The truth is humans can build our new environments and are actually improving things in many areas
[2:09:27.120 --> 2:09:31.360]  but when we slovenly do it, we toxically do it, we are bad but instead the globalists have
[2:09:31.360 --> 2:09:36.080]  everybody focused on carbon dioxide that we know is the lowest ever recorded the last 100 years in
[2:09:36.080 --> 2:09:40.720]  planetary history. The plants are dying. There's not enough carbon dioxide, not enough oxygen,
[2:09:40.720 --> 2:09:46.080]  deserts are spreading because when plants don't get enough carbon dioxide, they die. They need
[2:09:46.080 --> 2:09:52.800]  that as much as water or more. This is mainline science and it's crazy how we found the oil,
[2:09:52.800 --> 2:09:58.000]  which is toxic as well, right in time to start terraforming or geoengineering the planet back
[2:09:58.000 --> 2:10:04.560]  to where we need. A lot of evidence shows Mars lost its atmosphere so they're focusing on something
[2:10:04.560 --> 2:10:10.480]  we need, a trace gas, to tax it while rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet and
[2:10:10.480 --> 2:10:15.120]  admittedly in their own words endangering everything. With mainline scientists saying we're
[2:10:15.120 --> 2:10:21.120]  already creating alien life forms here, similar to the Andromeda strain, why are the elites doing
[2:10:21.120 --> 2:10:25.760]  it? But as you said, the power trip of wanting to find these technologies first, Dr. Group.
[2:10:26.400 --> 2:10:32.320]  It's called playing God. That's what it boils down to. It's playing God. They know that if
[2:10:32.320 --> 2:10:36.720]  they can create a sterile society, which by the way they are doing, you can type in Google,
[2:10:36.720 --> 2:10:41.840]  you can look anywhere online and you will see sterility in males, low sperm count in males,
[2:10:41.840 --> 2:10:46.080]  one out of, you know, five males now can't can see. They don't have, they're not sterile
[2:10:46.080 --> 2:10:50.320]  and the generations, each generation, it gets worse and worse and worse. You know,
[2:10:50.320 --> 2:10:56.560]  if you can create a sterile world, then everybody is going to have, it just all makes sense. Alex,
[2:10:56.560 --> 2:11:00.080]  when you look at the- Because the corporation is mother now, you go to it and it makes a
[2:11:00.080 --> 2:11:05.040]  trojan- They want the patented on the gene. They want to be able to control life. They want to be
[2:11:05.040 --> 2:11:10.400]  able to control agriculture. They want to be able to control everything. It's in their hands.
[2:11:10.400 --> 2:11:14.800]  And people go see something like Blade Runner, the new one, and lick their lips like it's cool
[2:11:14.800 --> 2:11:20.560]  and cutting edge. We already have replicants. We're already replicants. They knew 50 years ago,
[2:11:20.560 --> 2:11:25.440]  Cold Springs Harbor Eugenics, that if they gave you GMO and added certain chemicals that they
[2:11:25.440 --> 2:11:31.360]  could manipulate in rats and change the generations two, three, four out to any trait they wanted.
[2:11:31.360 --> 2:11:39.600]  So the GMO is a genetically engineered nanotech viral GMO system to already manipulate. We're
[2:11:39.600 --> 2:11:45.680]  already manipulated. We're already programmed. And we already have sperm counts down 90% in
[2:11:45.680 --> 2:11:50.720]  the West. Brazil, its sperm count wasn't down 30 years ago. Now when glyphosates came in,
[2:11:50.720 --> 2:11:55.840]  their sperm counts down 70-something percent. Their cancer rates are approaching ours. It's a plan.
[2:11:56.400 --> 2:12:04.000]  That's a plan. That's been planned for a long period of time to create dependency. If you want
[2:12:04.000 --> 2:12:10.000]  to have a baby, you have to go to them. You can pick the traits. They'll do it in a test.
[2:12:10.000 --> 2:12:14.640]  And notice Bill Gates is saying, don't let all the Muslims in. Give me money. I'll take care of them
[2:12:14.640 --> 2:12:21.600]  with vaccines. So he goes, hey, you don't want the Muslims? Let me roll then. In fact, I've had
[2:12:21.600 --> 2:12:27.600]  little messages sent to me like, just get out of the way, Jones. Anything that has genes in DNA,
[2:12:27.600 --> 2:12:33.520]  they want full control. The plants, the bacteria, the fungus, they're using a lot of the bacteria
[2:12:33.520 --> 2:12:39.040]  and the fungus and the viruses and everything to get and to use. They use them as carriers.
[2:12:39.040 --> 2:12:42.880]  They use them as carriers to go in and actually replace or to cut or to support.
[2:12:42.880 --> 2:12:47.840]  Oh, no, that's 30-year-old technology where they have engineered viruses that are really nanotech
[2:12:47.840 --> 2:12:51.680]  that go in a quote, anti-stress vaccine and then eat the areas of the brain
[2:12:51.680 --> 2:12:55.360]  associated with higher brain waves. So now you're not depressed. You're also not at higher
[2:12:55.360 --> 2:12:58.720]  levels. You're not angry anymore. And I know folks that have had military people who are given
[2:12:58.720 --> 2:13:04.880]  these shots, they're gone. But we can stop it. I mean, the thing is, we can make a difference.
[2:13:04.880 --> 2:13:09.840]  We are making a difference. We're not trying to be negative. We have to admit how bad it is, though.
[2:13:09.840 --> 2:13:15.440]  You have to know what's going on out there to know what the solution is. So you have a situation.
[2:13:15.440 --> 2:13:19.520]  It could be a bad situation, a good situation. And then you have a solution. It can be a good
[2:13:19.520 --> 2:13:25.040]  situation or a bad situation. We know what's going on. This is out there for anybody to
[2:13:25.040 --> 2:13:29.920]  find. You know, it's not like I'm coming on and making this stuff up. It's a warning, though.
[2:13:29.920 --> 2:13:34.960]  It's a warning. This is the direction. This is what's going on. This is what they want.
[2:13:34.960 --> 2:13:40.400]  They want that full control. And let's expand. Let's expand on this. About a month ago,
[2:13:40.400 --> 2:13:45.200]  one of the experimental secret NASA aircraft, Small Shuttle, landed back on Earth. We could
[2:13:45.200 --> 2:13:50.400]  put it on screen. And they had men out there in space suits all around it in case a microorganism
[2:13:50.400 --> 2:13:55.360]  from space was on it. Give me a break, folks. They do that, but they've got thousands of labs
[2:13:55.360 --> 2:14:00.240]  we know of. China, as you know, is the leader. India as well. Russia, the US. Randomly splicing
[2:14:00.240 --> 2:14:05.920]  everything just to see what will happen. And then open air planting corn, wheat, and other stuff
[2:14:05.920 --> 2:14:12.320]  that has genetically engineered viruses in it. Open air and super fungus and super bacteria
[2:14:12.320 --> 2:14:19.200]  and super, look at this article right here, super algae that they admit is totally changing the
[2:14:19.200 --> 2:14:24.320]  environment. What is going on here? It's like the island of Dr. Moreau or X-Men. They do all
[2:14:24.320 --> 2:14:30.080]  the X-Men, but that is transhumanism. You're literally creating... But you don't turn into
[2:14:30.080 --> 2:14:36.000]  Superman. You grow giant tumor and die. Right, right, right. So the good news is, like I was
[2:14:36.000 --> 2:14:40.720]  saying, cleansing the body, detoxification, repairing your bowel, not eating the genetically
[2:14:40.720 --> 2:14:47.200]  modified foods, not taking in all the phthalates, purifying your water, drinking pure clean water.
[2:14:47.200 --> 2:14:52.480]  It all comes back to simplicity in the things God created. Okay, you look at all this stuff that man
[2:14:52.480 --> 2:14:58.160]  is creating to control the population and control your genes and control the food that you eat.
[2:14:58.160 --> 2:15:03.360]  Well, just the solution is going back to God's things. You know, God, clean the air in your
[2:15:03.360 --> 2:15:07.840]  house where you sleep. You know, clean the water, drink pure water, and let's expand the minutes
[2:15:07.840 --> 2:15:10.800]  we have left for the next guest joins us. This is amazing. Dr. Rupert, we're going to be back on
[2:15:10.800 --> 2:15:14.560]  the NLN News tonight. I'm going to tap an emergency report for us on the genetic
[2:15:14.560 --> 2:15:18.880]  armageddon they're trying to set up. We can stop it. Just like we exposed sorrows and globalism
[2:15:18.880 --> 2:15:23.680]  in the New World Order, now we're starting to win because we were super negative and truthful.
[2:15:23.680 --> 2:15:27.360]  A lot of people say, oh, I don't want any stress. Kind of this new, agey thing of just a believer
[2:15:27.360 --> 2:15:33.120]  thing's going to be okay. No, work towards peace and justice and open freedom and fight the evil.
[2:15:33.120 --> 2:15:37.760]  And then, as Thomas Jefferson said, tyranny will vanish. But it's only when good men do nothing
[2:15:37.760 --> 2:15:42.560]  and women do nothing that evil grows. So that's why support the broadcast. Support yourself.
[2:15:42.560 --> 2:15:48.080]  You may be dug in a hole like I was at 280 pounds. And I'm still not perfect, but at 235 a lot better.
[2:15:48.080 --> 2:15:53.680]  Just start that journey of getting healthier, getting better, moving forward, you know, praying
[2:15:53.680 --> 2:15:58.240]  to God for guidance and getting products like Biome Defense is really probably the best
[2:15:58.240 --> 2:16:02.960]  probiotic you can get out there. I mean, a massive research, the Myco ZX, a new cutting-edge probiotic
[2:16:02.960 --> 2:16:06.800]  that goes after all the other garbage that the Biome Defense doesn't have. Spend a few minutes
[2:16:06.800 --> 2:16:12.640]  telling folks again about Myco ZX and Biome Defense. I'm discounting it 30% off, even though it's been
[2:16:12.640 --> 2:16:17.600]  sold out for almost five plus months because the ingredients are so hard to get and so hard to source
[2:16:17.600 --> 2:16:23.120]  because they're so organic and so well-crafted and pure. Why is Myco ZX important? What does it do
[2:16:23.120 --> 2:16:28.560]  in the gut that normal probiotics don't do? Well, you know, using the oxy powder to clean out your
[2:16:28.560 --> 2:16:34.880]  gut really good and get rid of that biofilm and then using the Myco ZX because over the last 15
[2:16:34.880 --> 2:16:40.800]  years, we are really seeing an overgrowth, an epidemic of yeast. First, get the oxy powder
[2:16:40.800 --> 2:16:44.560]  that's your best seller for a decade, higher level oxygen, flushes out the intestines. First,
[2:16:44.560 --> 2:16:48.400]  flushes much out of the way, then bomb it with this. It's almost like you have to take two steps back
[2:16:48.400 --> 2:16:52.800]  before you take two steps forward and you want to really clean out the intestines. Of course,
[2:16:52.800 --> 2:16:56.640]  you want to look at what you're putting in your mouth and you want to avoid any of the alcohol
[2:16:56.640 --> 2:17:01.680]  as much as possible and all that. But, you know, people, they want to live their life too and be
[2:17:01.680 --> 2:17:08.720]  social. Sure. So, tell folks what's in the Myco ZX. The Myco ZX has a specific blend of herbs that
[2:17:08.720 --> 2:17:17.040]  will address multifaceted strains of different types of fungus, mole, mycoplasms. Now, you have
[2:17:17.040 --> 2:17:21.840]  more gallons disease. You have all of these fungal things. Medical profession, by the way, is still
[2:17:21.840 --> 2:17:25.440]  not even testing for this, which I feel sorry for most people that walk. But there are mainline
[2:17:25.440 --> 2:17:29.840]  doctors saying maybe it's real. It's like... There are mainline doctors, but they're still not in
[2:17:29.840 --> 2:17:34.000]  the diagnostic process. Is it a nanotech fungus? Because I'm another trying to splice fungus with
[2:17:34.000 --> 2:17:38.880]  the machine. Well, they found fungus in chemtrails. They found it. They're finding all these new types
[2:17:38.880 --> 2:17:44.000]  of fungus that are everywhere. Fungus now, they just came out a couple weeks ago and said fungus
[2:17:44.000 --> 2:17:50.400]  is now airborne. They used to... And notice how they're telling us in the movie... What's the
[2:17:50.400 --> 2:17:56.240]  movie about a deep space travel? Interstellar. Notice it's a fungus in the air that kills everything.
[2:17:56.240 --> 2:18:00.880]  And they're telling you what's coming. I can't... I'm sorry. They always tell you what's coming.
[2:18:00.880 --> 2:18:07.040]  I mean, you know, that's... It's always the little things that you can't see that what is what you
[2:18:07.040 --> 2:18:12.320]  really need to look at. Just like andromus. For example, the X2, which is one of the things that
[2:18:12.320 --> 2:18:20.560]  I always say everybody needs, that will help wake you up and detoxify and decalcify your pineal
[2:18:20.560 --> 2:18:29.040]  gland and open up your reality again to understanding things. Look at... Look at these... The far left.
[2:18:29.040 --> 2:18:33.760]  They're going crazy right now. I mean, talk about, oh, they have solutions for everything. They're
[2:18:33.760 --> 2:18:38.560]  the ones that really like Monsanto and they're the ones that are, you know... Yeah, a lot of the
[2:18:38.560 --> 2:18:42.960]  original left, they're smart on things like that, but they're totally crazed now. They're totally crazed.
[2:18:42.960 --> 2:18:49.200]  I mean, look, there's a solution. Clean your body. Take good products. And the best part of it is
[2:18:49.200 --> 2:18:53.280]  you're supporting the mission. You're supporting the info. Let me expand on that. You're supporting the
[2:18:53.280 --> 2:18:58.000]  revolution. It just hit me. They're upset about globalism, the new order, a big time of changes
[2:18:58.000 --> 2:19:02.240]  here. They're all afraid. Everybody's concerned. You should be. And the media gets them to project
[2:19:02.240 --> 2:19:08.240]  their subconscious real concerns. They're six cents on to Trump. So the world's changing. People are
[2:19:08.240 --> 2:19:13.360]  freaked out. And so they're training them to project it on to us when we're people actually trying to
[2:19:13.360 --> 2:19:19.840]  fix things. Yeah. We have the solution. That's our job. We spent 20 years. Alex has been out there
[2:19:19.840 --> 2:19:24.800]  promoting all this stuff, telling you what the truth is. And you know what? You should actually
[2:19:24.800 --> 2:19:29.520]  have a section on your site where people can go and say the truth about Sandy Hook, the truth about
[2:19:29.520 --> 2:19:35.280]  9-11, when how are... We broke on Monday the gay sexual orgies of the Vatican and forced them to
[2:19:35.280 --> 2:19:39.760]  cover it. This is like everybody's, oh, you're such a conspiracy theorist talking about all this.
[2:19:39.760 --> 2:19:45.680]  No. Here's all the facts right here. This is true. Just go do your research and find out for
[2:19:45.680 --> 2:19:49.120]  yourself what's going on. It's amazing how much they lie to us. Dr. Rube, thank you so much.

[2:24:28.640 --> 2:24:33.680]  anti-cumia hosting. If I go over his bio, it'll take this whole segment, but I saw this article
[2:24:34.320 --> 2:24:38.640]  in the London Guardian, Your Place or Mine, Texas Liberals and California Conservatives,
[2:24:38.640 --> 2:24:44.400]  Swap States. He ran for Congress last year there in Los Angeles area. Didn't win. He thought we
[2:24:44.400 --> 2:24:49.680]  better move to Texas. Well, that's a lot better than all the trendies that are in failed Hollywood
[2:24:49.680 --> 2:24:54.160]  coming here and then trying to replicate the same thing. He's a pro-life, pro-family, pro-Christian,
[2:24:54.160 --> 2:25:01.840]  conservative Republican. He's 42, and he heads up the shabo strategies, LLC, securities international.
[2:25:01.840 --> 2:25:05.440]  He's also his adjunct professor, teaching American government, California Baptist University,
[2:25:05.440 --> 2:25:10.080]  Iraq War veteran, serving for the first Office of Naval Intelligence. Later he worked with the
[2:25:10.080 --> 2:25:14.400]  Defense Intelligence Agency. He's a fully qualified information dominance war for officer,
[2:25:14.400 --> 2:25:17.600]  top security clearance, all that stuff. And I go over the rest of his bio. It'll take too long.
[2:25:17.600 --> 2:25:21.760]  They came to commissioner of the California State Parole Board while working at the White House
[2:25:21.760 --> 2:25:26.080]  Office of National Drug Control Policy. He served as the Clinton and Bush administrations where he
[2:25:26.080 --> 2:25:30.640]  was eventually promoted to a White House senior advisor for law enforcement, justice and drug
[2:25:30.640 --> 2:25:35.440]  control operations. He's the founder of several organizations that promote American values, youth,
[2:25:35.440 --> 2:25:39.600]  membership and deterrence. He's also the author of the counterterrorism book,
[2:25:39.600 --> 2:25:45.920]  a ethereal battle against evil or eternal battle against evil and the author of a number of books
[2:25:45.920 --> 2:25:54.320]  including this, the cartel organizational resiliency against all odds, conservativesmove.com.
[2:25:54.320 --> 2:25:58.880]  And let me tell you, we're having major groups of Californians move here. Most of them are just
[2:25:58.880 --> 2:26:04.160]  economic refugees, but a lot of people are conservatives or libertarians. I know my friend
[2:26:04.160 --> 2:26:08.720]  Dave Mustaine didn't do that on purpose. He stayed in my house many times, great patriot.
[2:26:08.720 --> 2:26:13.840]  He looked at Texas, but he moved to Tennessee instead to get out of California. So this is going
[2:26:13.840 --> 2:26:20.880]  on. This is big and a lot of folks are fleeing. So looking at this from a geopolitical information
[2:26:20.880 --> 2:26:26.080]  warfare position, I want to get his take on it, but also they're trying to get liberals to leave
[2:26:26.080 --> 2:26:31.680]  Texas to go to California, which is just amazing. So we make jokes about California breaking off.
[2:26:31.680 --> 2:26:37.120]  I think it already has. So Paul, thanks for coming on with us. Alex, thanks so much for having me.
[2:26:37.120 --> 2:26:40.400]  It's great to be with you and your audience. We got a few minutes here before we go to break
[2:26:40.400 --> 2:26:44.160]  them along segment, but just break down what brought you to this epiphany.
[2:26:45.280 --> 2:26:49.920]  Sure. Well, I'm a father with four kids. I was born and raised in California 43 years.
[2:26:49.920 --> 2:26:55.040]  My wife and I are Christian conservatives. We watched our state turn from what was once
[2:26:55.040 --> 2:26:59.440]  a red state, the state of Reagan, the state of Nixon, some of the best schools a generation
[2:26:59.440 --> 2:27:05.200]  ago, some of the safest streets, best jobs to now many parts looking like a third world country.
[2:27:05.200 --> 2:27:11.360]  Crime is out of control. Good jobs are hard to find. It's just it has become a cesspool in many
[2:27:11.360 --> 2:27:18.320]  areas. We tried to stay and fight, but the area is overrun by liberals from top down. Very difficult
[2:27:18.320 --> 2:27:24.080]  to make an impact. And the liberals seem to be angry. They can't pull the rest of country down
[2:27:24.080 --> 2:27:29.440]  with them. Well, they're going to try. And I think if anything, we as conservatives,
[2:27:29.440 --> 2:27:34.880]  Republicans around this country should look at California as the canary in the coal mine.
[2:27:34.880 --> 2:27:40.560]  When you look and you dig down into these inner cities, whether it's Los Angeles or San Bernardino
[2:27:40.560 --> 2:27:46.160]  or other areas, they are just devastated. And it's not only the outskirts. We're talking the
[2:27:46.160 --> 2:27:52.000]  inner cities, which are just basically war zones. And these are because of liberal policies in
[2:27:52.000 --> 2:27:58.400]  California. They let out so many people out of prison for these so called nonviolent offenses.
[2:27:58.400 --> 2:28:02.640]  And they're only looking at their last commitment offense, not, you know, forget the fact they got
[2:28:02.640 --> 2:28:08.560]  a home invasion, robbery and assaults and all those things on their record. The state has just
[2:28:08.560 --> 2:28:14.560]  got a different ideology than those of us with a conservative mindset. So when you live in California,
[2:28:14.560 --> 2:28:20.960]  you either got to take it or you got to say, look, time, time to move. We fought, we tried to fight,
[2:28:20.960 --> 2:28:26.000]  but I'll tell you what, we learned a lesson. And that is you can't help people who don't want to
[2:28:26.000 --> 2:28:30.560]  help themselves. And that's my next question. Long seven coming up. But as Illinois collapses,
[2:28:30.560 --> 2:28:33.920]  even though it has a lot of great people, as California collapses, or do you think it will
[2:28:33.920 --> 2:28:40.000]  collapse, will it ever dawn on them? Or do we have to almost build up defenses and not let
[2:28:40.000 --> 2:28:43.920]  people immigrate from California and Illinois? I mean, you can't do that constitutionally. But
[2:28:43.920 --> 2:28:48.640]  I mean, where is this going? Because as the as the disease of like Venezuela and North Korea,
[2:28:48.640 --> 2:28:53.440]  as communism grows, they never learn. They just try to attack everything like cancer.
[2:28:54.240 --> 2:28:59.920]  You know, it is very odd as a professor of government and political science. When you
[2:28:59.920 --> 2:29:04.960]  look historically, for example, whenever there's a rise in crime, and it's happened in American
[2:29:04.960 --> 2:29:10.000]  history, you'll see a change in political parties. But you don't see that happening in these ultra
[2:29:10.000 --> 2:29:15.680]  liberal states. Everything can go down the tubes. And the people still elect the exact same party
[2:29:15.680 --> 2:29:21.760]  over and over again. So I think we're in uncharted waters. However, I do think through our website,
[2:29:21.760 --> 2:29:26.080]  conservative movement, what we're doing, we're advocating to help people have a much better
[2:29:26.080 --> 2:29:30.720]  life. And we think that'll resonate back in California for a good positive revolution down
[2:29:30.720 --> 2:29:34.560]  the road. Fingers crossed. Wow. All right, by the way, they just told me Anthony Coombs is on
[2:29:34.560 --> 2:29:39.040]  vacation. It's Owen Shroyer, always been a great job doing the fourth hour. Wow. We're going to be
[2:29:39.040 --> 2:29:44.880]  talking more with our guest, Paul Shabo, on the other side of this break and talk about this
[2:29:44.880 --> 2:29:50.480]  conservative move.com. It just gets everybody discussing a larger issue. The Empire's on the
[2:29:50.480 --> 2:30:01.520]  run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network. Hi, I'm the Democratic National Committee. I got
[2:30:01.520 --> 2:30:06.640]  hacked by the Russians and all my emails got out to the public. I had undercover journalists
[2:30:06.640 --> 2:30:12.240]  exposed that I staged protests and will use violence and cheating to win. I had to fire the
[2:30:12.240 --> 2:30:17.040]  head of my committee because she was incompetent. My presidential candidate had an illegal private
[2:30:17.040 --> 2:30:21.920]  server with classified documents. But when the FBI and the DHS requested access to the materials,
[2:30:21.920 --> 2:30:26.960]  we would not give it to them. That same presidential candidate was married to an impeached former
[2:30:26.960 --> 2:30:31.840]  president who is also a rapist. My last president is also involved, as he has absconded in his
[2:30:31.840 --> 2:30:37.040]  hiding documents involved in an investigation into classified information leaking to the public.
[2:30:37.040 --> 2:30:41.600]  I had a tech staffer, processing server, and a federal prosecutor involved with me,
[2:30:41.600 --> 2:30:46.080]  all die mysteriously in less than a year. I had multiple members of my party arrested for
[2:30:46.080 --> 2:30:50.720]  pedophilic activity this year. Have I mentioned Trump Russia yet?
[2:30:51.840 --> 2:30:55.680]  For infowars.com, that's the DNC. This is Owen Schreuer.
[2:30:58.320 --> 2:31:02.400]  It's not just our water we need to filter. It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned. It's
[2:31:02.400 --> 2:31:07.280]  the air we're breathing, especially for our children. The artificial particulates of the
[2:31:07.280 --> 2:31:13.600]  chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems. The same team based right here in America
[2:31:13.600 --> 2:31:18.720]  that brought you the Alexa pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed
[2:31:18.720 --> 2:31:24.000]  Alexa pure breeze. Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers,
[2:31:24.000 --> 2:31:29.280]  your family, your children, to the best job you can to purify your air. The elite are masters
[2:31:29.280 --> 2:31:34.720]  at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic
[2:31:34.720 --> 2:31:39.760]  effects for themselves. The general public doesn't. The Alexa pure breeze would be a
[2:31:39.760 --> 2:31:45.920]  steal at $300, $400, $500. One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean. This
[2:31:45.920 --> 2:31:50.400]  is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older, more expensive filters
[2:31:50.400 --> 2:31:56.640]  that didn't do as good a job. Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at infowars.com.
[2:31:59.680 --> 2:32:03.760]  The reason infowars.com has five star ratings on major third party sites is because I want
[2:32:03.760 --> 2:32:07.840]  products I'm going to use for my family. I take this. My family takes this and then it funds
[2:32:07.840 --> 2:32:11.600]  the operation. But the most hardcore, truthful information you're going to find anywhere. So
[2:32:11.600 --> 2:32:16.560]  what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at infowars.com. If I ever
[2:32:16.560 --> 2:32:22.960]  forget to take them, like I'm having noticeable difference. I don't feel good. The nascent iodine
[2:32:22.960 --> 2:32:27.280]  is one of the ones that was life changing for me. Yeah, I've actually have just run out of
[2:32:27.280 --> 2:32:32.880]  my super female. I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym
[2:32:32.880 --> 2:32:39.920]  once again. Very exciting, feeling great, looking good. So and I know my hair is a little luxurious
[2:32:39.920 --> 2:32:46.000]  once again. So obviously a super female is amazing. I love it. Nascent iodine is essential.
[2:32:46.000 --> 2:32:50.160]  Survival Shield X2. If there's one product that I would say is life changing that I would suggest
[2:32:50.160 --> 2:32:56.240]  it's nascent iodine survival shield X2. It's got a five star rating. It's a win-win in
[2:32:56.240 --> 2:33:04.240]  infowarslife.com.
[2:33:09.360 --> 2:33:17.680]  You found it. The front lines of the human awakening. It's the info war. And now, Alex Jones.
[2:33:19.600 --> 2:33:24.480]  Look, it's simple. Western civilization has produced so much wealth and so much freedom.
[2:33:24.480 --> 2:33:30.080]  People become spoiled brats and then you give people the one to manage domesticated populations
[2:33:30.080 --> 2:33:34.880]  as political tools and skim money off the top. That's happened in Chicago. It's happened in LA.
[2:33:34.880 --> 2:33:38.560]  It's happened in hundreds of other towns and cities and the people know what they're doing.
[2:33:38.560 --> 2:33:42.240]  You have to realize that the Democrats knowingly engage in election fraud.
[2:33:43.120 --> 2:33:49.520]  They want to declare the last election null and void. They want to say Russians ran it all and
[2:33:49.520 --> 2:33:54.240]  then have Homeland Security under Obama's last executive order come in and have new elections
[2:33:54.240 --> 2:33:59.280]  that they oversee. We'll never have a real election again like Venezuela, folks. And I know that
[2:33:59.280 --> 2:34:04.720]  sounds dastardly. That's Atlantic Monthly's plan. And that's one of the elite publications.
[2:34:05.840 --> 2:34:10.880]  Elite cockroaches. But this is what they really mean to do. So we're in dire straits. If we can
[2:34:10.880 --> 2:34:16.400]  just teach basic prosperity and go, you came here from Venezuela, you don't want to live under
[2:34:16.400 --> 2:34:21.120]  communism, right? But instead, folks coming here from all over, they're not even taught,
[2:34:21.120 --> 2:34:26.720]  they're not even taught that. They're taught racial division, cultural division, cultural envy,
[2:34:27.920 --> 2:34:34.080]  exponential envy. It's designed, but again, we've contained the colleges. We've contained the
[2:34:34.080 --> 2:34:39.120]  globalists. We've contained the social engineering. So now it's incinerating itself. Our guest is a
[2:34:39.120 --> 2:34:44.240]  professor. I can get his take on what's happening on the colleges that are just supposed to bring
[2:34:44.240 --> 2:34:48.160]  down society. Instead, they're bringing themselves down, but really talk about the move to help
[2:34:48.160 --> 2:34:53.360]  Californians evacuate and where he thinks that state's going. A big London Guardian article
[2:34:53.360 --> 2:34:58.400]  about it. Your place, your mind, Texas Liberals and California Conservatives swapped states.
[2:34:58.400 --> 2:35:04.960]  So going back to our guest, Paul Shabo. Paul, you've got the floor for a few minutes here. Tell us
[2:35:04.960 --> 2:35:08.880]  about the movement where it's going. What's happening to universities? You're a smart guy.
[2:35:08.880 --> 2:35:12.880]  You've been involved highest levels at the White House, multiple White Houses. Where you see this
[2:35:12.880 --> 2:35:18.240]  trajectory going? Well, obviously, I'm greatly concerned for our country, the direction we're
[2:35:18.240 --> 2:35:24.400]  going. I think we see a lot of apathy. And we started conservative move almost as an accident.
[2:35:24.400 --> 2:35:31.040]  When my wife and I made the decision in November, December to move here to North Texas,
[2:35:31.040 --> 2:35:35.920]  we had a going away party and we invited a lot of our friends and family. And so many of them said
[2:35:35.920 --> 2:35:40.880]  to us, Hey, we're envious. We wish we could go with you. We thought about doing the same thing.
[2:35:40.880 --> 2:35:46.240]  We'd like to get out. And when we got here, we realized so many people had already left
[2:35:46.240 --> 2:35:50.960]  California and were living around here for the same reasons we were. And so we then decided
[2:35:50.960 --> 2:35:55.600]  to create a business model. We wanted to help conservative families, not just in California,
[2:35:55.600 --> 2:36:01.040]  but liberal bastions all across America from New York to San Francisco and say, look,
[2:36:01.760 --> 2:36:06.880]  you can live a better life and conservative move will help you. And so what we do is we look at the
[2:36:06.880 --> 2:36:11.760]  families who contact us through our website at conservative move.com. And we link them up with
[2:36:11.760 --> 2:36:16.240]  a conservative realtor. And we have other realtors around the country who can help them sell their
[2:36:16.240 --> 2:36:21.520]  home. And then on our end, we help them find their home. And we provide a lot of information about
[2:36:22.480 --> 2:36:28.320]  jobs, economy, schools, all those things that are critical public safety here in North Texas,
[2:36:28.320 --> 2:36:33.760]  where we are, I have four young kids ages nine, eight, seven and four, the public schools out here
[2:36:33.760 --> 2:36:41.040]  have a 98.2% graduation rate, which is pretty remarkable. Booming jobs, Toyota closed their
[2:36:41.040 --> 2:36:46.320]  North American headquarters in California. They've moved it out here to Plano. So you're seeing a
[2:36:46.320 --> 2:36:53.680]  major rush leaving California, but those are either a businesses that can and to be families that can.
[2:36:53.680 --> 2:37:01.600]  And we have seen for a long time, Texas doing a good job at marketing towards businesses to move.
[2:37:01.600 --> 2:37:06.240]  What we did is we said, why don't we now market towards families and simply tell them the story?
[2:37:06.240 --> 2:37:11.200]  Look, if we can do it, so can you. We've only been around as a conservative move now for about
[2:37:11.200 --> 2:37:17.760]  three weeks, over 1000 families have signed up the 40 different states. And I would just say
[2:37:17.760 --> 2:37:21.760]  your site, what you're doing is a bellwether. That's why it's important sample of what's happening.
[2:37:22.880 --> 2:37:28.480]  Keep going, but then I have a few other questions. Sure. No, absolutely. So we're excited. But I'll
[2:37:28.480 --> 2:37:33.040]  tell you, when you, when you hear the personal stories on our website, people fill out a contact
[2:37:33.040 --> 2:37:40.320]  form and many will leave a personal story about their reasons why and almost to an individual
[2:37:40.320 --> 2:37:45.600]  or a family, they feel the same. It's that where they were born and raised, they don't recognize
[2:37:45.600 --> 2:37:50.800]  it anymore. They look at their community. It's not the same. Many are locked down in their homes,
[2:37:50.800 --> 2:37:54.960]  afraid to go out on their streets. Well, listen, I'll be honest, I've been going to California my
[2:37:54.960 --> 2:37:59.520]  whole life and parts of it like Santa Cruz are ultra beautiful in Northern California too. But
[2:37:59.520 --> 2:38:04.640]  being in LA, being in other areas, it is like zombie land. There's something different about
[2:38:04.640 --> 2:38:08.960]  the people, no matter what color they are, they look like their souls have been sucked out.
[2:38:08.960 --> 2:38:13.440]  Last time I was at the big LA airport and just in and around town. What is going on there?
[2:38:14.320 --> 2:38:18.480]  Well, in California, you got to remember cost of living is ridiculous. The ultra liberal
[2:38:18.480 --> 2:38:22.960]  legislators there, they have a super majority in California. They just raised the gas tax,
[2:38:22.960 --> 2:38:28.160]  I think 12 to 14 cents going to kick in in October. So they continue to harm the working class.
[2:38:29.120 --> 2:38:34.560]  And don't they get there's a mass exodus out? No, they don't care. They honestly and Governor
[2:38:34.560 --> 2:38:38.720]  Jerry Brown, these folks, they don't get it. They don't care. They're beholden to the unions
[2:38:38.720 --> 2:38:43.360]  and special interests. So here's who they're harming. They're not harming the ultra left
[2:38:43.360 --> 2:38:47.280]  liberal that lives along the coast and breeze the good air. They're harming the majority of
[2:38:47.280 --> 2:38:51.840]  Americans who live in the. So it's pure conscious elitism. They're all tax exempt. They all run
[2:38:51.840 --> 2:38:56.080]  their scams. They know they've got third world people pouring in. They don't care. They're going
[2:38:56.080 --> 2:39:01.280]  to squeeze and squeeze and squeeze like McCron won't get rid of some of the 100% tax rates on
[2:39:01.280 --> 2:39:05.680]  middle class. You heard me right. And then has declared himself a God from a golden throne.
[2:39:06.960 --> 2:39:11.360]  And that's a scary place to go. I think here in America, at least we're giving people an
[2:39:11.360 --> 2:39:16.480]  opportunity to leave. They can be, it might be a joke in a sense, but refugees from California.
[2:39:16.480 --> 2:39:22.000]  Look, it's, it's, it's so backwards. Alex in California, the legislature will give tax breaks
[2:39:22.000 --> 2:39:28.240]  and free college to illegal aliens. Yet you have American citizens who can't get the same service
[2:39:28.240 --> 2:39:33.840]  if they're out of state. You have sanctuary cities that are exploding across not just,
[2:39:33.840 --> 2:39:37.920]  you know, California, but we know it's a race to bankrupt the country. Let me ask you this then.
[2:39:37.920 --> 2:39:42.320]  What about though the refugees that are just economic and are so stupid?
[2:39:42.320 --> 2:39:46.640]  They don't know why they've come here. I mean, let me tell you something. I love everybody, but
[2:39:46.640 --> 2:39:52.320]  the, but predominantly it's Californians in Austin. They don't know what, now I run a lot of
[2:39:52.320 --> 2:39:56.480]  conservative libertarian Californians that are the coolest people ever. Hell, as you know, 100 years
[2:39:56.480 --> 2:40:01.120]  ago, 50 years ago, I mean, my great, great grandmother and grandfather almost moved to LA,
[2:40:01.120 --> 2:40:05.920]  you know, back in the, you know, back in the 20s and 30s and stuff. And we're almost Californians,
[2:40:05.920 --> 2:40:09.520]  but they wanted to come back to Texas. California was more rugged for folks who don't know that
[2:40:09.520 --> 2:40:14.640]  even Texas, I mean, it was the real 49ers. It's had this horrible transformation. How do we keep
[2:40:14.640 --> 2:40:20.480]  Texas not with folks like you coming in, but from the contagion, they don't know why they left.
[2:40:20.480 --> 2:40:25.920]  They bring the exact same crap here once they get here. And that is a very legitimate concern that
[2:40:25.920 --> 2:40:29.840]  we hear from a lot of different people that people might be leaving for whatever reason,
[2:40:29.840 --> 2:40:33.360]  they can't find a job, but then they come to Texas and they're going to vote for the same
[2:40:33.360 --> 2:40:38.320]  crazy Democrat policies. And so we absolutely have a concern about that. My message to the
[2:40:38.320 --> 2:40:44.960]  Republican party is don't become complacent here or anywhere. Look at what happened in California.
[2:40:44.960 --> 2:40:46.720]  We basically lost it.
[2:40:46.720 --> 2:40:50.640]  Oh, they got the battlefield Texas blue state on video. Veritas got him saying,
[2:40:50.640 --> 2:40:52.640]  we're going to have illegals vote. Number throw Texas.
[2:40:53.440 --> 2:40:57.360]  Well, I wouldn't be surprised. We saw a lot of that happening in California. We saw that happening
[2:40:57.360 --> 2:41:03.040]  in our election as well. I honestly don't even think we should label the Democrats, Democrats.
[2:41:03.040 --> 2:41:08.240]  These are ultra left progressives. The old school blue dog Kennedy Democrats are gone.
[2:41:08.240 --> 2:41:11.840]  They don't control the Democrat party today. It's their conscious parasites.
[2:41:13.120 --> 2:41:18.240]  So again, where do you, what do you expect to happen to California though? Because even on
[2:41:18.240 --> 2:41:22.400]  the coast with the rich elites, they realize how dangerous it is. Is there any point that
[2:41:22.400 --> 2:41:28.160]  California might wake up? You know, it may very well wake up. I just don't see it happening in
[2:41:28.160 --> 2:41:32.480]  my generation. I think the voters there are stuck and locked. I think it's going to be the next
[2:41:32.480 --> 2:41:38.080]  generation coming up if anybody there that is still left to fight. But you know, when you go
[2:41:38.080 --> 2:41:44.080]  around LA, California, you see that the free phone booths everywhere, you have more imports of people
[2:41:44.080 --> 2:41:50.240]  from welfare than any other state. So there is a growing segment of the population that is very
[2:41:50.240 --> 2:41:55.760]  dependent on the government. But it looks like day of the dead. I mean, like no, no matter where
[2:41:55.760 --> 2:42:01.760]  you go, there's just giant mobs of zombie like homeless people completely locked out of their
[2:42:01.760 --> 2:42:07.440]  brains just shuffling around. It's hellish. Well, they have homeless encampments. Look,
[2:42:07.440 --> 2:42:13.680]  I served in Iraq and I've seen 10 cities. I was shocked to see 10 cities now sprout up in California.
[2:42:13.680 --> 2:42:18.240]  You have them in San Francisco. You have them in LA. You have them in San Bernardino. They're
[2:42:18.240 --> 2:42:23.600]  the little shanty towns along these riverways. And it shocks me to see that it is un-American.
[2:42:23.600 --> 2:42:28.400]  And yet these are happening in the most liberal cities in America. Why is it the liberal cities
[2:42:28.400 --> 2:42:33.040]  that are like stinking feted rat holes? I mean, they can turn a great town in a decade into a
[2:42:33.040 --> 2:42:38.480]  hellhole. What is it about? I don't know, but they continue that trend across America. And I think,
[2:42:38.480 --> 2:42:44.320]  you know, where we always have the right footing is in the debate and asking the simple question,
[2:42:44.320 --> 2:42:49.040]  what kind of communities do we want to see children raised in? I was a patrol deputy in
[2:42:49.040 --> 2:42:53.040]  San Bernardino. I worked in Los Angeles when you talk to the minority communities that are hard
[2:42:53.040 --> 2:42:57.120]  hit and devastated that have been there for such a long time. They can't put their kids on the
[2:42:57.120 --> 2:43:02.480]  street to play anymore. They would love to have school choice where they think California wants
[2:43:02.480 --> 2:43:08.880]  to bring in more refugees, 80 percent male. I have stacks of articles here in Sweden.
[2:43:09.680 --> 2:43:13.760]  They can't even have outdoor concerts anymore because the Muslims are raping everybody. I mean,
[2:43:13.760 --> 2:43:20.800]  what is that? I just don't think California right now understands what it means to be America.
[2:43:20.800 --> 2:43:25.280]  They are looking at third world countries as examples of what to become and what to be.
[2:43:25.280 --> 2:43:31.280]  I think they aspire to become Calcutta. I didn't imagine so. And many of these cities,
[2:43:31.280 --> 2:43:36.080]  if you look at them, you'll see more foreign flags flying than you do American flags, which
[2:43:36.080 --> 2:43:42.720]  absolutely floored me. If you have a Mexico versus USA soccer game in Southern California,
[2:43:42.720 --> 2:43:49.120]  guess what? The Mexico team has about 10 to one supporters on the street than your hometown Americans.
[2:43:49.120 --> 2:43:53.920]  So there's a lack of pride. I think that for who we are, many are not assimilating or carrying
[2:43:53.920 --> 2:43:58.560]  the torch for our colleagues. Hollywood's done a job on us. I mean, I got Atlantic Monthly right
[2:43:58.560 --> 2:44:02.880]  here saying Christianity's going down. America's going down. Trump, they said, Trump, you'll never
[2:44:02.880 --> 2:44:07.120]  stop us. We're going to kill America. I mean, they even admit they want to kill the country.
[2:44:07.120 --> 2:44:12.080]  It's not like, and it's not like they want to replace it with something better. They want to
[2:44:12.080 --> 2:44:18.080]  turn it into something like Venezuela or Cuba or North Korea. But I guess that's what the ruling
[2:44:18.080 --> 2:44:23.440]  ruling elites want. I want to play you a clip here because the good news is it's not radicalization.
[2:44:23.440 --> 2:44:27.520]  Conservatives, libertarians, patriots of every race, color, creed are waking up to the fact that
[2:44:27.520 --> 2:44:32.960]  we're in a existential war with globalists and their giant cohorts, radical Islam, third world,
[2:44:32.960 --> 2:44:38.480]  you name it. This aired last week. They called it terrorist in the news. A chilling National
[2:44:38.480 --> 2:44:42.880]  Rifle Association ad gaining traction online appears to be an open call for violence, but you
[2:44:42.880 --> 2:44:48.640]  watch it. It admits that we know they're coming for violence and that we're preparing in the info
[2:44:48.640 --> 2:44:53.840]  war to stand up and speak out, but that the Second Amendment is the ultimate backup so that we won't
[2:44:53.840 --> 2:45:00.720]  be transported into pure slavery like Venezuela. So Dana Loche does a great job voicing this and
[2:45:00.720 --> 2:45:05.680]  it just shows how the info war is radicalizing the entire conservative sphere, which we need to be
[2:45:05.680 --> 2:45:10.080]  radicalized to counter this radical threat. As Barry Goldwater said, extremism, the defense of
[2:45:10.080 --> 2:45:14.880]  liberty is no vice. This isn't a call to violence. It's a call that we know they're violent saying
[2:45:14.880 --> 2:45:21.920]  hashtag hunt Republicans. Here it is. They use their media to assassinate real news. They use
[2:45:21.920 --> 2:45:26.800]  their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler. They use their movie
[2:45:26.800 --> 2:45:32.560]  stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[2:45:33.120 --> 2:45:39.040]  And then they use their ex president to endorse the resistance all to make them march, make them
[2:45:39.040 --> 2:45:46.000]  protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia to smash windows, burn
[2:45:46.000 --> 2:45:52.480]  cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law abiding until the only option
[2:45:52.480 --> 2:45:58.880]  left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness. And when that happens, they'll use
[2:45:58.880 --> 2:46:05.760]  it as an excuse for their outrage. The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country
[2:46:05.760 --> 2:46:12.880]  and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth. I'm the
[2:46:12.880 --> 2:46:19.360]  National Rifle Association of America and I'm freedom's safest place. The clenched
[2:46:19.360 --> 2:46:24.880]  fist of freedom, the clenched fist of truth. That's the info war. That's the weapon. And
[2:46:24.880 --> 2:46:31.600]  you're an expert in the truth and taking actual info war. Paul, expanding on this,
[2:46:32.560 --> 2:46:39.680]  what would you say about what Dana Loesch was just saying? 100% on mark. And I wish we could find
[2:46:39.680 --> 2:46:47.440]  a way to broadcast that across America 24 7365 to awaken our own base. The problem with our side,
[2:46:47.440 --> 2:46:53.200]  Alex, is that we're too damn nice. We watch the other side roll over a steam roll as time and time
[2:46:53.200 --> 2:46:58.560]  and time again. And look, we're dealing with a bully on the other side and we've got to stand up
[2:46:58.560 --> 2:47:05.040]  and we've got to fight that. That piece right there by Dana is absolutely critical and on mark.
[2:47:05.040 --> 2:47:09.760]  You look at our first responders are law enforcement. They're damned if they do, damned if they don't.
[2:47:09.760 --> 2:47:15.600]  To think the Democrat party of today, the ultra left liberal is largely against law enforcement
[2:47:15.600 --> 2:47:19.680]  when just a generation ago was the complete opposite. We were all standing side by side,
[2:47:19.680 --> 2:47:25.040]  tough on crime. If you're tough on crime today, you are not a liberal. You're not a Republican.
[2:47:25.760 --> 2:47:30.080]  You just have a different way of looking at life. And again, you can look at California as that
[2:47:30.080 --> 2:47:35.600]  example. The soft on crime mentality has made you and I the victims violent crime is skyrocketing
[2:47:35.600 --> 2:47:41.200]  across that state and the Democrats. Well, let's just say it. Civilization is unraveling right
[2:47:41.200 --> 2:47:47.520]  now. And I just wonder how far it can go down before people wake up, Paul. And I mean, I see
[2:47:47.520 --> 2:47:52.080]  them fighting Trump so hard, trying to kill a recovery, trying to spew all this garbage,
[2:47:52.080 --> 2:47:58.240]  trying to hope we fail. It just seems like sepicoot. It seems like the left wants to
[2:47:58.240 --> 2:48:02.320]  suicide the whole country because they're threatened by prosperity. They want clowered and
[2:48:02.320 --> 2:48:06.720]  piven. They admit they want to wreck it all so they can rebuild it. But when communists and
[2:48:06.720 --> 2:48:12.480]  socialists and collectivists wreck something, it never comes back. No, it won't. And remember,
[2:48:12.480 --> 2:48:16.800]  America is still a grand experiment and the best experiment on the face of this planet. And one
[2:48:16.800 --> 2:48:22.160]  of the youngest democracies and consistently challenged the major difference between how
[2:48:22.160 --> 2:48:27.040]  we look at the Constitution from Republicans, the Democrats is the Democrats look at the
[2:48:27.040 --> 2:48:31.760]  Constitution as something that can evolve and change over time. Where those of us on the other
[2:48:31.760 --> 2:48:38.160]  side, we look at this as the foundational document of who we are. And when we lose that of who we
[2:48:38.160 --> 2:48:45.840]  are, then we become this open society, Merkel view of European mentality, which is not American.
[2:48:45.840 --> 2:48:49.840]  If people want that, they should move to Europe. But Americans need to stand up here and stand
[2:48:49.840 --> 2:48:54.080]  on who we are and not allow the left any more destruction of our principles and values.
[2:48:54.080 --> 2:49:00.080]  All right, my friend, I look forward to tracking and watching the success of the organization
[2:49:00.080 --> 2:49:04.640]  that you've launched, conservativemove.com. And I love the idea of us creating our own economies
[2:49:04.640 --> 2:49:10.240]  as libertarians, conservatives, constitutionalists, common sense, traditionalist, non suicidalist,
[2:49:11.120 --> 2:49:17.520]  non nihilist of a support and broadcast supporting organizations, pooling our resources together
[2:49:17.520 --> 2:49:21.840]  and not just giving our money and energy. And I found with say liberal IT companies,
[2:49:21.840 --> 2:49:26.160]  and most of them are, they will on purpose not do a good job for you because you're
[2:49:26.160 --> 2:49:30.320]  conservative or a lot of big companies say, oh, you're Alex Jones. And of course,
[2:49:30.320 --> 2:49:34.640]  if I was a gay couple wanting a cake, I could sue them. And they violate civil rights act,
[2:49:34.640 --> 2:49:38.320]  you know, and say, we're not going to let you, you know, work with our big credit card company
[2:49:38.320 --> 2:49:41.360]  because of what you do. They even tell us that emails and my lawyers go, yeah, you have a total
[2:49:41.360 --> 2:49:45.680]  lawsuit, you win. But it's just like, what am I going to do? It's just they're trying to strangle
[2:49:45.680 --> 2:49:50.160]  us. They're trying to shut us down. They're trying to destroy us. So more and more conservatives,
[2:49:50.160 --> 2:49:55.200]  libertarians, Christians need to really seek out people and build our own economy and break away
[2:49:55.200 --> 2:50:00.080]  from the parasites because they need us. We don't need them. And the parasites are finally
[2:50:00.080 --> 2:50:04.080]  figuring that out. So they're trying to bully us into submission. And just like the great
[2:50:04.080 --> 2:50:09.680]  meme war going on with CNN, it's only backfiring. I mean, everything they do is turning to crap,
[2:50:09.680 --> 2:50:13.680]  but it doesn't mean we can be complacent because the war has just begun. I want to thank you so
[2:50:13.680 --> 2:50:18.800]  much, Paul, for joining us. Thank you, sir. Appreciate it. Very, very exciting. Paul Chabot,
[2:50:18.800 --> 2:50:23.040]  just down joining us. Great guy. Find out more on his website, conservativemove.com. Okay,
[2:50:23.040 --> 2:50:26.880]  I got a little segment coming up and then Owen Schreuer is coming in. I want to hit some other
[2:50:26.880 --> 2:50:33.120]  breaking news that is coming up. Millions of people hit the streets to say hi to Trump in Poland.
[2:50:33.120 --> 2:50:37.520]  They got a few thousand, 10,000 or so out, get a bunch of attention in Germany.
[2:50:37.520 --> 2:50:41.840]  All Soros funded literally a bunch of jihadis running around saying they want to get Trump.
[2:50:41.840 --> 2:50:46.480]  Yeah, how dare that evil guy want to have free market? We like Kim Jong-un. He's much better.
[2:50:46.480 --> 2:50:51.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the InfoWar. InfoWars.com forward slash show.

[2:50:59.920 --> 2:51:04.560]  former congressman and Republican presidential candidate. I love these summer months because
[2:51:04.560 --> 2:51:09.520]  this is when I get to enjoy the fresh fruits and vegetables that are being harvested on small farms
[2:51:09.520 --> 2:51:14.080]  and in our backyards. We all look forward to garden tomatoes and corn on the cob.
[2:51:14.080 --> 2:51:18.000]  Don't you wish there was a better way to preserve their true taste and flavors?
[2:51:18.000 --> 2:51:23.200]  I'm here to tell you that there is a better way. It's by using the amazing home freeze
[2:51:23.200 --> 2:51:27.920]  dryer from Harvest Right. I have a Harvest Right freeze dryer and use it to preserve

[2:53:06.560 --> 2:53:11.200]  and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds, and antidepressants. And no,
[2:53:11.200 --> 2:53:15.040]  water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.

[2:54:29.520 --> 2:54:32.960]  All right, I've got some final stories I want to hit that Owen Shroyer is coming in. He has
[2:54:32.960 --> 2:54:38.080]  locked him loaded and wound up with a bunch of clips and news and ready to go. The meme war
[2:54:38.080 --> 2:54:46.400]  has turned CNN from a dead organization to just an absolutely destroyed crater in the ground
[2:54:47.520 --> 2:54:53.280]  less than zero. And I am so excited about that. A lot of amazing memes at Real Alex Jones on

[2:56:47.040 --> 2:56:50.480]  you. Let me just play this one more time. I'm going to go to break and come back and hit some other
[2:56:50.480 --> 2:56:58.400]  breaking news. Vatican police break up drug fuel Gay Orgy at home of Secretary of the Pope Francis
[2:56:58.400 --> 2:57:03.920]  Key Advisors. We broke this on Monday and then by Wednesday it broke in the international news.
[2:57:03.920 --> 2:57:08.560]  AP Reuters Daily Mail. But notice it then goes out of the news the next day like the deputy
[2:57:08.560 --> 2:57:14.080]  Pope caught running child kidnapping rings. Child rape rings. So how's the media counter? They just
[2:57:14.080 --> 2:57:18.960]  make it up that I said there's Mars basis. Never said it. They just they just lie and tell everybody
[2:57:18.960 --> 2:57:24.800]  that because they want to cover up. I mean, I'm sorry they want to cover up the real stuff. So
[2:57:24.800 --> 2:57:27.600]  here's the investigative journalist who lives in Rome who broke it on Monday.
[2:57:28.160 --> 2:57:35.920]  Conflict a few days before George Pell got booted out of the Vatican. We had basically the police
[2:57:35.920 --> 2:57:42.400]  breaking inside the Palace of the Holy Office, the ex inquisition now known as the congregation
[2:57:42.400 --> 2:57:48.320]  for the matters of faith. Basically the headquarters of the most holy office in the Vatican. The
[2:57:48.320 --> 2:57:55.920]  police broke in and found a gay orgy and they were using cocaine and they basically had to arrest
[2:57:55.920 --> 2:58:03.120]  the secretary of a very prominent cardinal who himself was waging war against Cardinal Pell.
[2:58:03.120 --> 2:58:10.640]  So there is also an internal war here. And of course, nobody wanted to show the face of this
[2:58:10.640 --> 2:58:18.720]  priest, but I wanted to show it to your viewers. It's called Monsignor Luigi Capozzi and only
[2:58:19.440 --> 2:58:24.560]  very few media think only RT probably just mentioned the name of Capozzi's boss.
[2:58:26.640 --> 2:58:29.680]  All right, and then it goes on because that simultaneously broke. He was covering it first
[2:58:29.680 --> 2:58:33.360]  and RT mentioned a little bit of it, but that's showing forcing this news out.
[2:58:33.360 --> 2:58:36.640]  Fourth hour straight ahead. Please spread the word and support our local affiliates.
[2:58:36.640 --> 2:58:40.160]  We're going to come right back. Five more minutes to know. Instroyer is coming in. But
[2:58:40.160 --> 2:58:46.160]  think about this. It's all confirmed. The Vatican is run by pedophiles and Satanists and they take
[2:58:46.160 --> 2:58:52.560]  your money and snort cocaine. More than two years ago, Info Wars first told you about our research
[2:58:52.560 --> 2:58:57.040]  into what has been called the iodine conspiracy. I've told you about how scientists have known
[2:58:57.040 --> 2:59:02.960]  for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started taking
[2:59:02.960 --> 2:59:08.080]  iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family into the water.
[2:59:08.080 --> 2:59:13.840]  They took the good halogen and put the deadly halogen in. And when the Fukushima crisis worsened,
[2:59:13.840 --> 2:59:18.800]  as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[2:59:18.800 --> 2:59:25.120]  Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine
[2:59:25.120 --> 2:59:31.040]  and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning
[2:59:31.040 --> 2:59:35.600]  iodine. You can pull these studies up for yourself. This is the real deal, folks. And the truth is
[2:59:35.600 --> 2:59:41.920]  that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen. Stock up on Survival Shield X2

[3:00:07.040 --> 3:00:17.280]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well,
[3:00:17.280 --> 3:00:23.200]  so does he. Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[3:00:26.320 --> 3:00:31.200]  We've got Owen Schreuer coming in. In the next segment, we'll cover a bunch of news,
[3:00:31.200 --> 3:00:35.120]  take your phone calls, you name it. Got a bunch of big guests tomorrow. I'm just going to leave
[3:00:35.120 --> 3:00:40.480]  it at that, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central, nightly news tonight, 7 o'clock. You know, I was on
[3:00:40.480 --> 3:00:44.160]  drudgereport.com, I was on infowars.com just now looking at the different headlines that are
[3:00:44.160 --> 3:00:52.960]  breaking. And everywhere Trump goes, they're chanting USA, USA, and they get so incredibly angry and so
[3:00:52.960 --> 3:00:57.200]  incredibly upset because the media wants to create the illusion that everyone hates Trump
[3:00:57.200 --> 3:01:00.880]  all over the world. But the Indian president loves him. Folks love him in India. That's a
[3:01:00.880 --> 3:01:05.680]  billion, one hundred million people. He's super popular. Folks in non-radical Muslim countries
[3:01:05.680 --> 3:01:10.800]  love him. People all over love Trump because they want prosperity. They know America's better
[3:01:11.600 --> 3:01:15.600]  than North Korea. But a new breaking video that I should probably stay to the next segment and
[3:01:15.600 --> 3:01:19.440]  cover. The crew's great, but you guys got to print me these as they come in because
[3:01:19.440 --> 3:01:25.200]  so much stuff's breaking on infowars.com. Arrogant Chris Como confronted about CNN
[3:01:25.200 --> 3:01:32.480]  threatens and threats the Trump mean maker. New Day host doubles down. Thinks he's so tough
[3:01:33.040 --> 3:01:38.160]  because his brother's a governor. How shameful that he has his job as his own producer said because
[3:01:38.160 --> 3:01:43.520]  his brother is the mob boss of New York. CNN host Chris Como was confronted today over
[3:01:43.520 --> 3:01:48.000]  why he deleted a tweet that asked whether the identity of the individual who created the infamous
[3:01:48.000 --> 3:01:52.800]  Trump wrestling meme should have been revealed. The New Day host was caught up in the CNN Black
[3:01:52.800 --> 3:01:57.600]  Bill Controversy when he tweeted CNN should reveal the name of Reddit user who made Trump wrestling
[3:01:57.600 --> 3:02:02.800]  video had a lot of bigot and hateful material on his page and website. Como was asked by the
[3:02:02.800 --> 3:02:06.320]  Rebels, Laura Loomer. I'll get Laura Loomer back on tomorrow. Let's get her on the start of the
[3:02:06.320 --> 3:02:12.640]  show tomorrow. Why he deleted a tweet that encouraged the extortion of Reddit user who posted a meme
[3:02:12.640 --> 3:02:17.840]  about CNN. Look at that billionaire strut he's got. What a thug. These people are all mentally
[3:02:17.840 --> 3:02:23.680]  ill. They are so cool. You're uncool, Como. You're a thug and a piece of crap. You're a filthy brother.
[3:02:23.680 --> 3:02:28.800]  There was no encouraging any extortion. He wasn't a teenager. The reason I took the tweet was because
[3:02:28.800 --> 3:02:33.440]  the decision had been made. I thought it was more conditional about whether or not his name was
[3:02:33.440 --> 3:02:39.520]  going to be released. Oh, so you admit you're a thug who reveals how CNN host thought it was
[3:02:39.520 --> 3:02:43.040]  responsible for the network to essentially be threatening the individual with a revelation
[3:02:43.040 --> 3:02:49.040]  that didn't stop anti-CNN memes. You know, they're just so used to a lot of the folks that have come
[3:02:49.040 --> 3:02:54.000]  into New York the last 100 years are from really authoritarian regimes. There was more history
[3:02:54.000 --> 3:02:57.680]  of rebellion in Europe against tyranny. Not that it was perfect, but a lot of folks that are used
[3:02:57.680 --> 3:03:03.840]  to bowing down to thugs and they just bow down to Como. So the video is up on infowars.com.
[3:03:03.840 --> 3:03:08.560]  I'm going to get Owen Schroer when he comes in to play that video. Got some other videos we
[3:03:08.560 --> 3:03:13.760]  haven't gotten to, but it's powerful. Should CNN reveal the name of the Reddit user who made
[3:03:13.760 --> 3:03:18.160]  Trump wrestling video? Had a lot of bigoted and hateful material on the page, said Cuomo.
[3:03:19.360 --> 3:03:22.880]  Probably totally made, probably not even a real person. We have the ultimate Trump
[3:03:22.880 --> 3:03:27.200]  meme compilation. That's a new compilation of a lot of the videos and some of the new ones,
[3:03:27.200 --> 3:03:35.120]  very, very powerful. When it gets into our $20,000 contest, we also had that Watson is running,
[3:03:35.120 --> 3:03:41.920]  that Watson is a quarterbacking right now. So a lot of breaking news at infowars.com.
[3:03:43.520 --> 3:03:47.680]  Trump, a new video, Poland's Christianity, key to defeating globalism and jihad.
[3:03:48.400 --> 3:03:54.480]  Why did Trump, White House aide, lie about how she got her job and why is she working for Soros?
[3:03:54.480 --> 3:04:01.200]  Very important article by Roger Stone. All this needs to get out. Germany banned soldiers from
[3:04:01.200 --> 3:04:07.280]  wearing uniforms at G20 summit for their own protection from the loving jihadis. Trump
[3:04:07.280 --> 3:04:13.120]  donates presidential salary to restoring civil war battlefield. CNN comments, he says they have
[3:04:13.120 --> 3:04:18.880]  some very serious problems. In fact, we'll play his clip on that. We haven't gotten to that either
[3:04:18.880 --> 3:04:24.720]  on the other side of this break. Drew is doing a great job. Nightly news again, as I said tonight,
[3:04:24.720 --> 3:04:29.440]  seven o'clock central. A lot of big things coming here to info wars, but we've got to do it because
[3:04:29.440 --> 3:04:33.760]  look at Macron, who announced himself to be God Emperor. He says all children will take 11 new
[3:04:33.760 --> 3:04:42.320]  vaccines and that anyone that gets in his way, he's declared martial law. Very, very liberal.
[3:04:42.320 --> 3:04:48.880]  Even Politico is reporting when he is the Jupiterian Lordship, because I guess he was a
[3:04:50.960 --> 3:04:56.960]  child, you know, diblet that the globalists enjoy. So now he's there. He's there. He's there. He's
[3:04:56.960 --> 3:05:03.600]  their God. Hi, I'm the Democratic National Committee. I got hacked by the Russians and all my emails
[3:05:03.600 --> 3:05:08.800]  got out to the public. I had undercover journalists exposed that I staged protests and will use
[3:05:08.800 --> 3:05:14.720]  violence and cheating to win. I had to fire the head of my committee because she was incompetent.
[3:05:14.720 --> 3:05:18.320]  My presidential candidate had an illegal private server with classified documents,
[3:05:18.320 --> 3:05:23.040]  but when the FBI and the DHS requested access to the materials, we would not give it to them.
[3:05:23.040 --> 3:05:28.000]  That same presidential candidate was married to an impeached former president who is also a
[3:05:28.000 --> 3:05:32.880]  rapist. My last president is also involved as he has absconded in his hiding documents involved
[3:05:32.880 --> 3:05:38.160]  in an investigation into classified information leaking to the public. I had a tech staffer,
[3:05:38.160 --> 3:05:42.960]  processing server, and a federal prosecutor involved with me, all died mysteriously in less
[3:05:42.960 --> 3:05:47.440]  than a year. I had multiple members of my party arrested for pedophilic activity this year.
[3:05:47.440 --> 3:05:55.520]  Have I mentioned Trump Russia yet? RingForWars.com. That's the DNC. This is Owen Schreuer.
[3:05:59.520 --> 3:06:05.200]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry. Our ancestors would hear the drums
[3:06:05.200 --> 3:06:12.400]  of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense. 60 years ago,
[3:06:12.400 --> 3:06:18.240]  when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own,
[3:06:18.240 --> 3:06:24.000]  air raid sirens. But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[3:06:24.000 --> 3:06:28.800]  Pathogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy our
[3:06:28.800 --> 3:06:34.960]  vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death. I personally counter
[3:06:34.960 --> 3:06:42.480]  this onslaught with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs
[3:06:42.480 --> 3:06:48.400]  to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[3:06:48.400 --> 3:06:52.640]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today. It's time for us to take our
[3:06:52.640 --> 3:06:57.840]  bodies back into our own hands, and it starts at infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.

[3:08:03.920 --> 3:08:10.800]  You are listening to an infowars.com frontline report. If you are receiving this transmission,
[3:08:10.800 --> 3:08:16.000]  you are the resistance. And now your host, Owen Schreuer.
[3:08:16.000 --> 3:08:24.560]  Well, CNN has completely failed. And it's not even a news organization anymore.
[3:08:25.120 --> 3:08:34.800]  CNN is now a meme. So when you hear CNN, or you see the CNN logo, it used to be at one time
[3:08:34.800 --> 3:08:41.680]  associated with news. Then it was associated with fake news. Now it's just a meme. Now CNN
[3:08:41.680 --> 3:08:49.920]  is a complete meme. And I don't know if it all started with the retweeted meme of Donald Trump
[3:08:49.920 --> 3:08:56.240]  beating up the CNN logo at a WrestleMania match. Infowars was putting out memes,
[3:08:56.240 --> 3:09:01.920]  Trump memes with the CNN head on it, months before Trump retweeted that meme. But that was
[3:09:01.920 --> 3:09:08.240]  the meme that really kicked off the great meme war and has transformed CNN from a news organization
[3:09:08.240 --> 3:09:15.520]  into now a meme. Just a complete meme, as Alex is still cleaning up. Hey, look at this shirt,
[3:09:15.520 --> 3:09:19.280]  Alex. How does it feel? I'm just getting my phones and just getting my guns. Sorry.
[3:09:21.440 --> 3:09:26.400]  CNN is fake news. This is the t-shirt at infowars.com. Once again, ahead of the curve,
[3:09:26.400 --> 3:09:31.600]  as usual, we knew that CNN was fake news. We were telling that for years. And now the president
[3:09:31.600 --> 3:09:37.760]  has forced it to go mainstream. And we've actually got a new video. CNN can't win anymore, folks.
[3:09:37.760 --> 3:09:44.720]  I was actually amazed when I saw this video because Chris Cuomo has a security detail.
[3:09:44.720 --> 3:09:50.720]  He gets into some Cadillac Escalade blacked out windows. And we're about to have this new video
[3:09:50.720 --> 3:09:56.320]  that just went up on the internet today. Infowars.com. You can see the story from Paul Joseph Watson,
[3:09:56.320 --> 3:10:03.760]  arrogant Chris Cuomo confronted about CNN threats to Trump meme maker. So let me know when we have
[3:10:03.760 --> 3:10:10.880]  that video ready to go, guys. So Chris Cuomo comes out of the CNN studio. Laura Loomer confronts him
[3:10:10.880 --> 3:10:15.440]  saying, hey, how do you feel being a total bully saying Trump's a bully, being a total hypocrite?
[3:10:15.440 --> 3:10:19.040]  And he says, well, you know, that's not what happened. I'm not a bully. You know, I wasn't a
[3:10:19.040 --> 3:10:24.720]  15-year-old kid. That's the other thing. And then had to address the tweet he deleted.
[3:10:25.920 --> 3:10:33.600]  So nonetheless, if you work at CNN now, I guess they've always had the security detail that waits
[3:10:33.600 --> 3:10:39.760]  outside. But I would imagine they are worried about violence is why they have that security detail.
[3:10:39.760 --> 3:10:44.880]  Well, there's no violence being done against the CNN host. There is violence being done against
[3:10:44.880 --> 3:10:48.240]  Republicans. We'll get to that in a second. We've actually got new news on that, if you can believe
[3:10:48.240 --> 3:10:56.320]  that or not. But so now CNN is getting confronted by citizen journalists on the street, outside of
[3:10:56.320 --> 3:11:01.520]  their studios, and they're being forced to answer questions. And it's only continuing to make them
[3:11:01.520 --> 3:11:08.080]  look worse because they have to defend themselves. So now all of these CNN anchors who go on air
[3:11:08.080 --> 3:11:13.680]  in the offensive position, who go on air on the offensive against Trump, who arrogantly go on air,
[3:11:13.680 --> 3:11:18.800]  even though nobody takes them seriously anymore, they then have to go out into the real elements
[3:11:18.800 --> 3:11:23.040]  of the real world and be confronted with the real people who know who they really are.
[3:11:23.040 --> 3:11:31.040]  And they look like complete jackasses. Here is Chris Cuomo being addressed on the streets.
[3:11:33.040 --> 3:11:38.320]  On July 4th, CNN and Chris Cuomo were accused of extorting a Reddit user who allegedly created
[3:11:38.320 --> 3:11:44.560]  the Trump vs. CNN Wrestling GIF. Chris Cuomo tweeted, should CNN reveal the name of the Reddit user
[3:11:44.560 --> 3:11:48.480]  who made the Trump Wrestling video? A lot of bigoted and hateful tweets coming at me.
[3:11:48.480 --> 3:11:55.360]  And then Cuomo had to delete that tweet. Then Laura Loomer caught Cuomo on the streets.
[3:11:55.360 --> 3:11:59.520]  A quick question for you. Why did you delete a tweet in which we're encouraging the extortion
[3:11:59.520 --> 3:12:06.960]  of a Reddit user who posted a meme about CNN? There was no encouraging any extortion. It wasn't
[3:12:06.960 --> 3:12:11.600]  a teenager. And the reason I took the tweet down was because the decision had already been made.
[3:12:11.600 --> 3:12:15.520]  I thought it was more conditional about whether or not his name was going to be released than it
[3:12:15.520 --> 3:12:21.040]  wasn't. His name was already going to be... So CNN is admitting they were debating Doxin.
[3:12:23.520 --> 3:12:28.400]  This is Chris Cuomo admitting, well we thought about Doxin. Do you think that it's appropriate
[3:12:28.400 --> 3:12:33.760]  for CNN to be targeting private citizens over memes that CNN doesn't like? I don't think that's
[3:12:33.760 --> 3:12:37.360]  what happened and I think you should look at the other contacts on that site and think about who
[3:12:37.360 --> 3:12:42.880]  you're defending. What site? He doesn't even mention the site. But you guys accused Trump of bullying.
[3:12:42.880 --> 3:12:51.680]  And there's the key. There's the key. And then CNN security approached Laura telling her she
[3:12:51.680 --> 3:13:01.120]  couldn't film on the streets. I love this. This is one of the best... I'll tell you. These people
[3:13:01.120 --> 3:13:06.800]  are so out of touch with reality. This is honestly their reality. Okay. I've had to deal with this
[3:13:06.800 --> 3:13:11.920]  before. I dealt with this when I spoke to Van Jones. I dealt with this when I confronted Don
[3:13:11.920 --> 3:13:17.200]  Lemon on the street. I dealt with this when I confronted Jake Tapper on the street. There is
[3:13:17.200 --> 3:13:23.440]  this... I don't know what it is. It's an arrogance but it's beyond an arrogance. They really think
[3:13:23.440 --> 3:13:29.920]  that they can tell you not to film them. They really think they are above you. They really
[3:13:29.920 --> 3:13:35.920]  think they are above reproach. Now I'll give credit to Chris Cuomo. I'll give credit to Van Jones
[3:13:35.920 --> 3:13:41.120]  when I stopped Van Jones and talked to him. He gave me 30 minutes. Chris Cuomo gave Laura
[3:13:41.120 --> 3:13:47.120]  Loomer a minute to talk there. I'll give him a credit. Now Don Lemonade and Fake Fapper,
[3:13:47.120 --> 3:13:50.560]  they didn't want to have any time of day with me. I can't blame them. They're complete nothings.
[3:13:51.440 --> 3:13:55.360]  But they always have a little handler or a little security detail that's there.
[3:13:56.000 --> 3:14:03.440]  If you dare film them... Did you just dare film Chris Cuomo, the Almighty? Did you just
[3:14:03.440 --> 3:14:08.160]  dare film the Almighty, Chris Cuomo? And so then the CNN security detail runs over there.
[3:14:08.160 --> 3:14:13.840]  Do you have any footage of Chris Cuomo? You're not allowed to have that. You can't have that
[3:14:13.840 --> 3:14:19.920]  footage. You're literally on the streets of New York, dude. Okay? This is America. You have the
[3:14:19.920 --> 3:14:25.120]  right to film someone in public. Absolutely. And then Cuomo even volunteered a minute of his time.
[3:14:25.120 --> 3:14:28.640]  But there's always... There's little minions, little security minions telling you,
[3:14:28.640 --> 3:14:34.960]  you can't film. You can't take pictures. That's illegal. No. Let me tell you something. If you're
[3:14:34.960 --> 3:14:40.240]  out there and you happen to run into a CNN talking head or an MSNBC talking head or whoever,
[3:14:40.240 --> 3:14:44.960]  and you want to film them or take a picture, you have every right to do that. And the minute
[3:14:44.960 --> 3:14:48.880]  someone tries to intimidate you from CNN or from one of these networks to say,
[3:14:48.880 --> 3:14:53.280]  you can't take that picture. You can't record that interview. You can't talk to this person.
[3:14:53.280 --> 3:14:58.560]  Stand up for yourself. That is complete bull. You have every right to film in public.
[3:14:59.280 --> 3:15:03.200]  And only the most arrogant people in the world would think that they're above reproach.
[3:15:03.200 --> 3:15:08.480]  And those are the people at CNN. Now, Ted Cruz has come out. Now, remember,
[3:15:10.880 --> 3:15:17.440]  Chris Cuomo, just not only did he probably admit it in the tweet, he just admitted it on film.
[3:15:18.320 --> 3:15:25.040]  CNN did whatever research they had to do, whatever investigation they had to do to find out or
[3:15:26.160 --> 3:15:30.080]  they're saying they did, who really knows, I guess, they are the fake news network.
[3:15:30.080 --> 3:15:35.120]  They know who made the meme, they found out who it was, and they got his personal information,
[3:15:35.120 --> 3:15:42.240]  and then they got in touch with him and essentially intimidated him or hashtag CNN blackmail,
[3:15:42.880 --> 3:15:49.120]  blackmailed him into making a public apology. They then ran with the public apology on air
[3:15:49.120 --> 3:15:54.640]  to puff up their own chest, pretend they had a victory, pretend we were successful. We got
[3:15:54.640 --> 3:16:02.320]  the mad guy to apologize. We had the final laugh. We're CNN. And then, of course, they become a meme
[3:16:02.880 --> 3:16:08.080]  overnight. But look at this. They admitted, so they did all the research. They got his private
[3:16:08.080 --> 3:16:12.400]  information. They had the conversation with him. Chris Cuomo says, well, we know it's not a 15-year-old
[3:16:12.400 --> 3:16:16.400]  boy, so I guess they know who it is. Of course, they did. They tried to intimidate him. They forced
[3:16:16.400 --> 3:16:23.200]  him to apology. But they are admitting, they are admitting that they were going to release his
[3:16:23.200 --> 3:16:29.920]  private information if he didn't apologize. That's essentially what CNN has admitted.
[3:16:29.920 --> 3:16:38.640]  So now Ted Cruz comes out today, or excuse me, he actually said, I guess he said this yesterday,
[3:16:38.640 --> 3:16:46.560]  CNN may have broken the law. According to Senator Cruz, CNN threats to dox the Reddit user who
[3:16:46.560 --> 3:16:53.200]  created the Trump wrestling CNN video could be a violation of Georgia law. So how do you like that?
[3:16:53.200 --> 3:16:59.280]  CNN, of course, is headquartered in Atlanta. And Ted Cruz say, well, CNN, you may have actually
[3:16:59.280 --> 3:17:10.640]  broken the law. I'm telling you, it's incredible to see CNN not just getting beaten to a bloody pulp
[3:17:10.640 --> 3:17:15.120]  politically by President Trump and by we the people and by the info warriors out there.
[3:17:15.120 --> 3:17:24.080]  But they're also doing it to themselves. They're not only absorbing all of the blows from
[3:17:24.080 --> 3:17:29.600]  free citizens, from President Trump, from real media. They're also shooting themselves in the
[3:17:29.600 --> 3:17:39.120]  foot left and right. And they don't get it. They really don't get it. So CNN is already dead as
[3:17:39.120 --> 3:17:45.840]  a news organization. CNN is now a meme. The question is what is the future of CNN? Are they
[3:17:45.840 --> 3:17:52.080]  going to continue to do their broadcasts and go on air and pretend that people care what they think,
[3:17:52.080 --> 3:17:58.880]  pretend their real news, pretend that anybody takes them seriously, anybody trusts them?
[3:17:58.880 --> 3:18:07.280]  You know, it's been rumored that President Trump's FDA is considering banning
[3:18:09.600 --> 3:18:16.960]  big pharmaceutical ads from television. And there was a list put out of the CNN advertisers.
[3:18:16.960 --> 3:18:23.040]  These are the advertisers to boycott. But it didn't include the big farm advertisers that go on
[3:18:23.040 --> 3:18:31.440]  there regularly. And I'm just thinking, if the FDA made it illegal for big pharmaceutical
[3:18:31.440 --> 3:18:36.880]  companies to pedal their pharmaceutical drugs, you know the ads I'm talking about, side effects
[3:18:36.880 --> 3:18:42.880]  include blindness, death, paralyzation, cancer, nervousness, brain explosion, lung collapse,
[3:18:42.880 --> 3:18:50.320]  foot, leg falls off. If the FDA bans those ads from television, how much longer can a CNN
[3:18:50.320 --> 3:18:55.680]  really last? I think CNN is the only one that I think that would be a death blow to because
[3:18:55.680 --> 3:18:59.280]  I think people are so sick of CNN, even advertisers at this point are going to start
[3:18:59.280 --> 3:19:04.640]  dropping off when their next round of contracts come up. MSNBC at least has some ratings that they
[3:19:04.640 --> 3:19:09.680]  can at least provide to advertisers. But I don't think CNN is going to be there much longer. So
[3:19:10.320 --> 3:19:15.760]  did CNN break the law? What is the future for CNN? Are they going to continue to shoot themselves
[3:19:15.760 --> 3:19:20.560]  in the foot? Are the memes ever going to stop? I mean, my gosh, the memes don't stop. I couldn't
[3:19:20.560 --> 3:19:24.800]  believe it. I thought I saw all the memes in the world yesterday, hundreds of these things. And
[3:19:24.800 --> 3:19:32.560]  then there's hundreds of new ones today. So CNN is now officially a meme. Of course, infowars.com is
[3:19:32.560 --> 3:19:38.400]  having the competition who can make the best CNN meme. I don't know how Paul Joseph Watson is going
[3:19:38.400 --> 3:19:45.040]  to judge this. There's CNN putting themselves in a trash can. There's Trump Hulk smashing CNN
[3:19:45.040 --> 3:19:52.400]  into the ground. CNN is beyond fake news. CNN is ISIS. CNN is now a meme. And it is because we,
[3:19:52.400 --> 3:19:56.640]  the people, have decided that it's time for CNN to be looked at as the joke that it is.
[3:19:58.400 --> 3:20:04.480]  It's been said any society is only three missed meals away from chaos. Those times may be near.
[3:20:04.480 --> 3:20:08.880]  Think about it. Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia
[3:20:08.880 --> 3:20:14.080]  and North Korea. Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city
[3:20:14.080 --> 3:20:19.040]  shutdowns. And a crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages
[3:20:19.040 --> 3:20:23.920]  from a single cyber attack. When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government
[3:20:23.920 --> 3:20:28.560]  knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency. That's why you need your

[3:25:38.320 --> 3:25:43.600]  find like-minded people and you know maybe you're walking behind a CNN set or a fake news set.
[3:25:43.600 --> 3:25:49.840]  You know here was one I was actually thinking about where your CNN is fake news shirt where your
[3:25:49.840 --> 3:25:55.520]  CNN is terrorist shirt where your Trump is my president shirt where these shirts with these
[3:25:55.520 --> 3:26:00.480]  powerful messages on them and I was thinking we're always trying to get behind a news broadcast
[3:26:00.480 --> 3:26:05.120]  so we're always trying to get in a news broadcast and they're kind of getting wise to this they're
[3:26:05.120 --> 3:26:09.200]  going through tactics they're making bigger stages putting them higher putting them on roofs
[3:26:09.760 --> 3:26:14.560]  creating like a 30 foot space you can't even reach them you know security detail that rushes
[3:26:14.560 --> 3:26:19.360]  them out of the studio and then into a blacked out car they drive away in. Here's another thing
[3:26:19.360 --> 3:26:25.200]  that you could do put your CNN is fake news t-shirt on put your Trump is my president shirt on and
[3:26:25.200 --> 3:26:30.160]  then go sit in the front row at a sporting event. I can't believe this is something that we haven't
[3:26:30.160 --> 3:26:34.240]  thought of or discussed. You sit in the front row behind a baseball game there's like 20 people
[3:26:34.240 --> 3:26:38.720]  that are on camera for the entire nine innings you go everybody's seeing the wrestling memes that
[3:26:38.720 --> 3:26:42.800]  they're putting out you sit in the front row at a wrestling match you wear your make America free
[3:26:42.800 --> 3:26:46.480]  again hat from info wars.com that product unfortunately is gone now a great hat where your
[3:26:46.480 --> 3:26:52.640]  Trump hat where your CNN is fake news t-shirt on under it you'll be in the the entire video the
[3:26:52.640 --> 3:26:58.160]  entire time and for entire history so you can literally get that message in there for entire
[3:26:58.160 --> 3:27:01.760]  years you go to a basketball game football game whatever it is where your CNN is a terrorist
[3:27:01.760 --> 3:27:06.640]  t-shirt where you're seeing in his fake news t-shirt if you got on a broadcast for nine innings of a
[3:27:06.640 --> 3:27:11.680]  baseball game sitting in the front row I have a feeling that I'm not speaking for Alex I just
[3:27:11.680 --> 3:27:16.640]  have a feeling that that would count all right so take advantage of the fourth of July mega
[3:27:16.640 --> 3:27:22.000]  specials take advantage of the meme contest going on at info wars.com right now take advantage of
[3:27:22.000 --> 3:27:28.720]  the CNN is fake news contest going in at going on an info wars store and info wars.com right now as

[3:27:36.080 --> 3:27:40.880]  from Linda Sarsour you know I interviewed somebody that's we're going to air the interview tonight
[3:27:40.880 --> 3:27:46.480]  on the nightly news that infiltrated care here in America pretty incredible stuff that he talked
[3:27:46.480 --> 3:27:52.320]  about now here's one of the leading agents of care Linda Sarsour sisters and brothers it's been 16
[3:27:52.320 --> 3:27:59.840]  almost 17 years since the horrific attacks of 9-11 this is really amazing community find ourselves
[3:27:59.840 --> 3:28:04.880]  unprepared so we're led to believe that 9-11 was done by radical Islamic terrorists but listen to
[3:28:04.880 --> 3:28:10.640]  how she spins it afraid of this administration and the potential chaos that they will ensue on our
[3:28:10.640 --> 3:28:16.080]  community and we already saw their potential it's the Trump administration that's waging chaos against
[3:28:16.080 --> 3:28:21.760]  Muslims now Muslim ban three they are relentless to travel ban not a Muslim ban and want to see how
[3:28:21.760 --> 3:28:27.200]  much we as a community can endure and want to see who our friends are and how hard we're going to
[3:28:27.200 --> 3:28:32.880]  fight back against this administration and I hope that we when we stand this is an agent of Hamas
[3:28:32.880 --> 3:28:39.680]  folks that a lot accepts from I was alleging it for a long time it we know it now against tyrants
[3:28:39.680 --> 3:28:45.360]  and rulers not only abroad or in the other side of the world speaking for Sharia law United States
[3:28:45.360 --> 3:28:50.880]  of America where you have fascists and white supremacists and Islam there it is Islamophobes
[3:28:50.880 --> 3:28:55.600]  in the White House white supremacists in the White House you know what I'm done with this girl
[3:28:56.400 --> 3:29:02.640]  look this woman is an enemy of the free world okay and by the way for a white supremacist
[3:29:03.680 --> 3:29:07.840]  I believe he just appointed a black man to be the surgeon general so not a very good white
[3:29:07.840 --> 3:29:17.600]  supremacist as president Trump but look care is a wing of Hamas okay linda sarsour is an agent of
[3:29:17.600 --> 3:29:25.120]  Hamas sent to America to trick easily brainwashed people to believing the false narrative that
[3:29:25.120 --> 3:29:29.840]  Sharia law is not here to dominate them do you really want your women to look like linda sarsour
[3:29:29.840 --> 3:29:33.440]  do you really want American women to look like linda sarsour they can't even show their face
[3:29:33.440 --> 3:29:40.880]  they can't even show their hair no this is America this isn't sharia law it's time for people to
[3:29:40.880 --> 3:29:48.960]  realize that care is Hamas a terrorist organization infiltrating this country we're on the march

[3:33:07.280 --> 3:33:15.440]  live from the info wars dot com studios you're listening to the alex joneshow and now your
[3:33:15.440 --> 3:33:24.320]  host owin treuer we're going to cover the g20 protests going on in hamburg right now in germany
[3:33:25.040 --> 3:33:29.680]  they're absolutely out of control pretty unbelievable imagery we're going to be showing you but
[3:33:30.880 --> 3:33:36.400]  and i'm sitting here and i'm always i'm always watching the news folks i've always got every
[3:33:36.400 --> 3:33:41.120]  news broadcast i've got my finger on the pulse of what's going on and i it's just amazing because
[3:33:41.120 --> 3:33:46.160]  i'm sitting here thinking about how we're going to cover the g20 protests going on which they're
[3:33:46.160 --> 3:33:52.800]  showing live behind me right now you can see these monster police trucks being drove onto the scene
[3:33:52.800 --> 3:33:58.160]  firing water cannons at people the streets literally packed with protesters and all different
[3:33:58.160 --> 3:34:01.920]  kind of outfits and this that and the other thing and i'm sitting here thinking about how we're
[3:34:01.920 --> 3:34:09.760]  going to cover this when all of a sudden one of the mainstream news networks flips over to cover
[3:34:09.760 --> 3:34:16.000]  venezuela for a second and it's like oh yeah that's right there's massive protests and writing going
[3:34:16.000 --> 3:34:22.960]  on in venezuela right now oh how can we forget about that venezuela is absolutely absolutely
[3:34:22.960 --> 3:34:29.680]  falling apart right now and it's just amazing because you see all this going on you see the
[3:34:29.680 --> 3:34:36.560]  things that nikki haley is saying and she continues to just to have war rhetoric again today today
[3:34:36.560 --> 3:34:45.520]  talking about how we will defend ourselves folks when we elected donald trump we changed
[3:34:45.520 --> 3:34:51.680]  the status quo we took the status quo back from the establishment and now we are in control of
[3:34:51.680 --> 3:35:00.480]  the status quo and that is why cnn is now fake news and a meme the globalists the establishment
[3:35:00.480 --> 3:35:09.120]  are going to do something drastic in an attempt to retake the status quo and i can just really
[3:35:09.120 --> 3:35:16.960]  see all of it being laid out in front of us right now you've got syria you've got north korea
[3:35:16.960 --> 3:35:22.080]  those are going to be the tipping points they'll probably stage a false flag revolving around
[3:35:22.080 --> 3:35:26.800]  one of those countries or russia blame it on the enemy and then send us into another war
[3:35:26.800 --> 3:35:31.360]  that they are eventually hoping will engulf the entire world and then they can just bring in
[3:35:31.360 --> 3:35:36.880]  the new world over world order one world government to end any and all sovereignty
[3:35:39.840 --> 3:35:44.400]  but it's just amazing i'll try to focus on the g20 right now because it's it's going on right now
[3:35:45.600 --> 3:35:50.560]  you've got protesters in the streets and i'm looking at these protesters and i'm just saying
[3:35:50.560 --> 3:35:57.120]  okay who are these people what are they protesting why are they out on the streets so
[3:35:57.680 --> 3:36:03.200]  voraciously why do the police need to have thousands of armored police out there with
[3:36:03.200 --> 3:36:08.560]  riot shields why do they need to have police tanks essentially okay you can call them a truck
[3:36:09.520 --> 3:36:15.040]  why do they need to have police trucks with water cannons police fully armed riot shields riot
[3:36:15.040 --> 3:36:21.520]  helmets all of this going on why is all of this going on what is going on why is the g20 such a
[3:36:21.520 --> 3:36:30.480]  tipping point why hasn't it been such a powder keg in the past and it's all the same pattern it's
[3:36:30.480 --> 3:36:38.480]  all the same story george soros funded groups are trying to destabilize these countries
[3:36:39.440 --> 3:36:43.760]  which can go in so many different angles you can destabilize and bring in martial law bring in the
[3:36:43.760 --> 3:36:49.600]  police state you can destabilize and fund an overall bigger war you can destabilize and then
[3:36:49.600 --> 3:36:54.560]  have regime change so there's all different angles that they can use this destabilization tactic
[3:36:55.440 --> 3:37:02.240]  in order to reach an end but i'm just sitting here i'm just thinking what do these people think is
[3:37:02.240 --> 3:37:09.040]  going on why are they so animate about this protest because i've done this dozens of times
[3:37:09.040 --> 3:37:11.840]  are not the only one there's other people that have gone out on the streets we talked to the
[3:37:11.840 --> 3:37:16.400]  protesters here they all they have different reasons for their protest immigration you know
[3:37:16.400 --> 3:37:21.120]  travel ban muslim ban white supremacy nazis you know they throw all these little virtue
[3:37:21.120 --> 3:37:25.840]  signaling words in there but it's all the same thing it's anti-trump we hate trump we don't
[3:37:25.840 --> 3:37:31.600]  want trump to be president we are sore losers we are immature we don't have a life of our own
[3:37:31.600 --> 3:37:36.960]  so we're going to go out and protest so is that the same thing that's going on with these g20
[3:37:36.960 --> 3:37:42.960]  protesters in hamburg that can only be the assumption and then you look at some of these
[3:37:42.960 --> 3:37:49.920]  pictures you see that they've got people i mean folks you are looking at footage i mean again
[3:37:51.360 --> 3:37:55.840]  police trucks water cannoning people riot police out in full force
[3:37:57.600 --> 3:38:03.440]  i don't even know what they're protesting there's no message there's no unification
[3:38:03.440 --> 3:38:07.920]  none of the signs even make sense half of look at this woman she's got a bunny mask on
[3:38:09.200 --> 3:38:14.160]  nice bunny mask so again what am i supposed to think about these people why are they protesting
[3:38:16.160 --> 3:38:22.400]  but there's that there's that lingering thought there's that lingering common denominator that
[3:38:22.400 --> 3:38:28.560]  is president trump and so these are all the liberals and keep in mind that merkel is in
[3:38:28.560 --> 3:38:35.040]  an election year she's trying to do anything she can to try to save her position including
[3:38:35.040 --> 3:38:40.000]  sending out swat teams essentially raiding people's homes for posts on social media so now
[3:38:40.720 --> 3:38:46.160]  if you post something that is probably you know anti-immigration anti-merkel
[3:38:46.800 --> 3:38:54.480]  anti-european union union well you might get raided police officer might be at your door
[3:38:54.480 --> 3:38:59.840]  oh wow all of a sudden you don't want to tweet something or post something negative about
[3:38:59.840 --> 3:39:07.360]  merkel huh but you've got protests on the streets in full force so again the whole thing to me
[3:39:07.360 --> 3:39:13.440]  just doesn't make any sense pretty typical of these protesters they don't have a clue their head
[3:39:13.440 --> 3:39:19.280]  isn't even screwed onto their shoulders and if you were actually to go ask these people hey why are
[3:39:19.280 --> 3:39:26.080]  you out here protesting my guess is they wouldn't have an answer i mean look at this one this is on
[3:39:26.080 --> 3:39:33.360]  a cnn story a video on the story zombies descend on hamburg for g20 protests you have people that
[3:39:33.360 --> 3:39:40.560]  have literally spent hours to dress themselves up as zombies i don't know what it looks like they
[3:39:40.560 --> 3:39:45.840]  just covered themselves in gray paint or something so they spend all this time to dress themselves
[3:39:45.840 --> 3:39:54.000]  up as zombies and walk the streets in protest at the g20 summit there's the video why what have you
[3:39:54.000 --> 3:40:04.320]  accomplished what is your message what is this art uh okay so a thousand people dressed as zombies
[3:40:04.320 --> 3:40:11.760]  and marched at the g20 summit again why it doesn't make any sense to me to me that just looks like
[3:40:11.760 --> 3:40:19.920]  the brainwashed masses that have nothing better to do are willing to go out and spend their time
[3:40:19.920 --> 3:40:24.960]  in the streets protesting because they have nothing else they have nothing else that brings them
[3:40:24.960 --> 3:40:29.360]  together they have nothing else that they can say they've accomplished so this to them is their
[3:40:29.360 --> 3:40:35.520]  moment this to them is their compliment accomplishment this is their group these are their people
[3:40:35.520 --> 3:40:46.480]  and this is how they are impacting the world okay so that's going on at g20 we'll keep our fingers
[3:40:46.480 --> 3:40:50.720]  to the pulse of that meanwhile donald trump was in poland today we've already talked about this but
[3:40:50.720 --> 3:40:58.240]  it needs to be mentioned donald trump shows up poland prepares a great welcome for him you've
[3:40:58.240 --> 3:41:07.120]  got more people that show up to see and hear donald trump in poland for today's event than you had for
[3:41:07.120 --> 3:41:14.080]  the entire 2016 campaign people showing up for hillary clinton in america so you've got more
[3:41:14.080 --> 3:41:18.720]  people willing to show up for donald trump in poland than you had people that were willing to show
[3:41:18.720 --> 3:41:23.520]  up for hillary clinton in america that's just the numbers that's just the optics you can see that for
[3:41:23.520 --> 3:41:28.800]  yourself then they're chanting donald trump they're loving donald trump they're waving american flags
[3:41:28.800 --> 3:41:35.600]  they're dawning american flags at restaurants in poland but cnn couldn't handle it could they
[3:41:36.160 --> 3:41:43.120]  the meme the the meme known as cnn couldn't handle it and i'm telling you they are outing
[3:41:43.120 --> 3:41:48.720]  themselves they are showing their hands everything that they're accusing of trump everything that
[3:41:48.720 --> 3:41:54.000]  they're accusing of conservatives alt right whatever they want to say they're guilty of
[3:41:54.800 --> 3:42:00.240]  they are the ones that did it the russia collusions that was the democrats that was hillary clinton
[3:42:00.240 --> 3:42:06.640]  the violence the violence after the election they said that that was going to be trump supporters
[3:42:06.640 --> 3:42:09.520]  nope ended up being bernie supporters ended up being trump haters
[3:42:09.520 --> 3:42:18.880]  so it just goes on and on now oh yeah and oh the trump voters won't accept the results of the
[3:42:18.880 --> 3:42:22.960]  election meanwhile here seven months later the democrats still haven't accepted the results
[3:42:22.960 --> 3:42:27.440]  of the election so again they take what they're guilty of and then they point the finger at you
[3:42:27.440 --> 3:42:32.320]  for what they're guilty of this is another example of it this is how we know who they really are
[3:42:32.320 --> 3:42:40.160]  are this is from cnn conservative polish politicians bust people in for trump's speech
[3:42:40.160 --> 3:42:46.560]  okay now they don't have any proof they don't really have any hard evidence they don't really
[3:42:46.560 --> 3:42:55.600]  know this they just assume that that's the case they just assume that this is what's going on now
[3:42:55.600 --> 3:43:00.320]  i'm not denying that this may have happened maybe some people got busted maybe they didn't maybe
[3:43:00.320 --> 3:43:04.880]  was paid for from conservatives but they don't actually offer any evidence they don't show you
[3:43:04.880 --> 3:43:10.720]  the buses they don't really tell you how it all went down oh but what they did do was they exposed
[3:43:10.720 --> 3:43:17.760]  their own hand didn't they you see we've been reporting on george soros groups and similar groups
[3:43:18.560 --> 3:43:24.880]  paying for trump protesters to get bused in they get a lunch they go on the same bus they show up
[3:43:24.880 --> 3:43:29.680]  they protest trump for a couple hours they get lunch they get on the bus and then they all go home
[3:43:29.680 --> 3:43:36.400]  this has been documented this has been admitted this is well known so this is what the democrats do
[3:43:37.040 --> 3:43:43.680]  in order to win this is their version of win paying people to go out and have their message heard
[3:43:44.560 --> 3:43:50.880]  so they just assume that that's the explanation for why trump is so popular in poland you see
[3:43:51.600 --> 3:43:55.920]  this is how out of touch with reality they are but this is how they think see they're letting
[3:43:55.920 --> 3:44:02.080]  you in on how they think so hillary clinton obviously a piece of trash candidate obviously
[3:44:02.080 --> 3:44:07.120]  not popular nobody likes hillary clinton can't get anyone to show up for events the only time they
[3:44:07.120 --> 3:44:12.240]  can even hope to have anybody show up is if they bring lebron james out or bring jz out or have
[3:44:12.240 --> 3:44:16.160]  madonna up on the stage saying how she wants to blow up the white house if you have hillary clinton
[3:44:16.160 --> 3:44:21.280]  shows up nobody cares nobody goes nobody wants to see bill clinton unless they're protesting him
[3:44:21.280 --> 3:44:26.160]  nobody wants to see tim cane literally nobody so nobody nothing these people are not popular nobody
[3:44:26.160 --> 3:44:30.240]  cares about them so the democrats know this i mean they know hillary wasn't really popular i mean
[3:44:30.240 --> 3:44:37.040]  they saw hillary speeches nobody showed up so they're sitting here saying wow nobody shows up for
[3:44:37.040 --> 3:44:41.920]  hillary events nobody shows up and chance how great hillary is we have to pay people to come to these
[3:44:41.920 --> 3:44:47.120]  events we have to bring in celebrities pay celebrities to come be at these events in order to get
[3:44:47.120 --> 3:44:54.320]  people to show out so we have to use tactics in order to get support because we don't have support
[3:44:54.320 --> 3:45:00.960]  we don't really have policy we just have identity politics so we have to use our money and our
[3:45:00.960 --> 3:45:06.080]  influence in order to gain support even though it's not real support it's bought and paid for
[3:45:06.080 --> 3:45:10.560]  support so that's how hillary clinton gets support that's how george soros movements get support
[3:45:10.560 --> 3:45:17.440]  so donald trump is grassroots organic support people actually like donald trump people actually
[3:45:17.440 --> 3:45:21.920]  resonate with donald trump it goes all the way around the world so people in poland here trump
[3:45:21.920 --> 3:45:26.160]  is going to poland they want to show up in force they want to show president trump that they
[3:45:26.160 --> 3:45:30.160]  resonate with his message they want to show their support for president trump they're
[3:45:30.160 --> 3:45:34.160]  chanting trump in the streets chanting president trump making a huge welcome party
[3:45:34.160 --> 3:45:41.280]  so what do the democrats do they say well this can't be what does cnn say cnn says no way this
[3:45:41.280 --> 3:45:47.440]  can't be possible how is it that donald trump could be popular in poland after all the fake news
[3:45:47.440 --> 3:45:52.720]  that we have spread about president trump after all of the lies and the slander and the libel
[3:45:52.720 --> 3:45:58.640]  that we have waged on donald trump and his family and his administration how can this be how can he
[3:45:58.640 --> 3:46:04.400]  be so popular how can president trump go to poland and get thousands and thousands of people to
[3:46:04.400 --> 3:46:10.000]  show up and chant and march and wave american flags we can't even get that at a hillary event
[3:46:10.000 --> 3:46:19.200]  what is going on here oh ah they must be busing them in they must be paying for them this can't be
[3:46:19.200 --> 3:46:26.800]  real that's right this is the this is how the left thinks folks so so they can't they really don't
[3:46:26.800 --> 3:46:30.320]  get it it's like the same thing they can't admit they're wrong so they really don't get it they can't
[3:46:30.320 --> 3:46:35.200]  accept the fact that trump is popular they can't accept the fact that president trump is beloved
[3:46:35.200 --> 3:46:40.160]  around the world they can't accept the fact that organically and and of the grassroots
[3:46:40.160 --> 3:46:45.040]  president trump has worldwide support they can't accept it because there's only one reality in
[3:46:45.040 --> 3:46:49.760]  their mind and that's their reality so if there's anything else that goes against their reality it
[3:46:49.760 --> 3:46:56.240]  can't be real so they can't wrap their heads around it so what do they do they assume that the tactics
[3:46:56.240 --> 3:47:01.680]  that they used to make hillary clinton appear popular to make their anti-trump protests appear
[3:47:01.680 --> 3:47:07.200]  popular they're assuming that those same tactics are now being used to make donald trump look popular
[3:47:07.200 --> 3:47:13.600]  they don't get it that president trump is actually popular people actually love and support president
[3:47:13.600 --> 3:47:20.080]  trump not fake paid for bought support george soro style that they had for hillary clinton
[3:47:20.080 --> 3:47:28.400]  and that's why when i saw this story on cnn trying to make up the excuse that all this support for
[3:47:28.400 --> 3:47:33.440]  president trump and poland can't be real they're busting them in they're using the george soros
[3:47:33.440 --> 3:47:37.600]  tactic of course they won't admit to that they won't admit that that's actually how they're
[3:47:37.600 --> 3:47:46.880]  thinking but that's what they're doing and it all makes sense folks president trump has i don't
[3:47:46.880 --> 3:47:52.240]  even he's trumped them he's literally trumped them there is no other word there is no other phrase
[3:47:52.240 --> 3:47:58.560]  there is no other word in the dictionary to explain it president trump has trumped the liberal media
[3:47:58.560 --> 3:48:05.440]  president trump has trumped the democrats because they don't know what to do when they try to explain
[3:48:05.440 --> 3:48:10.000]  how all this is happening they show you the blueprint how do they how they got to where they were
[3:48:10.560 --> 3:48:16.320]  and then on the back end it only makes trump more popular and then less popular i mean this is the
[3:48:16.320 --> 3:48:23.200]  360 win this is how you trump the establishment with president trump so it's unbelievable that
[3:48:23.200 --> 3:48:28.560]  president trump goes to poland it's more support more patriotism more americana in poland for
[3:48:28.560 --> 3:48:34.240]  president trump then you had the entire 2016 camp campaign combined for hillary clinton
[3:48:35.840 --> 3:48:40.640]  and the left they don't know what to do they don't know how to explain it they must be
[3:48:40.640 --> 3:48:46.480]  busing people in that has to be it there's no way president trump is popular didn't you hear me
[3:48:47.120 --> 3:48:53.920]  i said trump was a racist did you not hear what i said president trump is racist why do you still
[3:48:53.920 --> 3:48:58.480]  like him i said president trump is racist oh my gosh they still like him what is going on they must
[3:48:58.480 --> 3:49:06.480]  be busing them in that's it they must be using our tactic now no folks president trump is the
[3:49:06.480 --> 3:49:12.320]  real deal president trump is really popular around the world we finally have a president of the united
[3:49:12.320 --> 3:49:19.840]  states and by the way jason sheffitz comes out the other day and gives congress a hard time
[3:49:20.400 --> 3:49:26.880]  says congress has nothing to point at to say we're victorious uh they have nothing to point at to
[3:49:26.880 --> 3:49:31.200]  say this is what we've done this is what we've accomplished and so then what happens today
[3:49:31.200 --> 3:49:39.600]  today congress joins trump war on regulations cuts a year's worth of obama regulations
[3:49:39.600 --> 3:49:46.640]  in one week congressional lawmakers have gone all in on president trump's bid to slash obama
[3:49:46.640 --> 3:49:54.640]  and regulations targeting 19 billion dollars in rules and the elimination of enough red tape
[3:49:54.640 --> 3:50:02.640]  to free up 5200 federal workers the cuts proposed by the house appropriations committee this week
[3:50:02.640 --> 3:50:06.720]  amount to a year's worth of regulations under the obama administration so how do you like that
[3:50:07.600 --> 3:50:13.680]  the obama cuts are real they're coming in full force president trump is kicking ass i mean it
[3:50:13.680 --> 3:50:18.160]  honestly you know sometimes you just it's like how do you even come up here and report on how
[3:50:18.160 --> 3:50:22.800]  victorious we've been of course we haven't had the ultimate victory yet of course we're still in
[3:50:22.800 --> 3:50:28.400]  the matrix of course we're still in the controlled paradigm yes this is all going on but we're slowly
[3:50:28.400 --> 3:50:32.720]  breaking the shackles we're slowly breaking the chains we're slowly freeing more minds we're
[3:50:32.720 --> 3:50:40.240]  slowly lighting brush fires of liberty everywhere around the world so but don't you worry oh don't

[3:55:10.480 --> 3:55:26.560]  like cnn you the people so you know this is really a remarkable story protester arrested at senator
[3:55:26.560 --> 3:55:33.440]  flakes tusan office a protester was arrested at senator jeff flakes tusan office thursday morning
[3:55:33.440 --> 3:55:46.560]  that's this morning and listen to what the protester said after he was arrested he said this to one
[3:55:46.560 --> 3:55:53.200]  of the campaign staffers or one of senator flakes staffers he said you know how liberals
[3:55:53.200 --> 3:55:58.720]  are going to solve the republican problem the staffer said no the protester went on to say
[3:55:58.720 --> 3:56:05.840]  they are going to get better aim the last guy that tried but he needed a better aim we will get
[3:56:05.840 --> 3:56:18.160]  better aim okay now if president trump has a crooked toenail or meets with someone that
[3:56:18.160 --> 3:56:23.440]  has a crooked toenail or had a salad and at the same table there was a russian dressing
[3:56:23.440 --> 3:56:30.640]  at the salad on the salad he has to explain it he has to disavow he needs to be asked all day
[3:56:30.640 --> 3:56:38.720]  long 24 7 why what why won't you disavow why are you a russian agent on the other side you've got
[3:56:38.720 --> 3:56:45.360]  somebody that goes to a republican baseball practice you know this isn't set enough folks but
[3:56:46.240 --> 3:56:51.280]  think about it like this perhaps the grace of god allowed nobody to get killed that day but think
[3:56:51.280 --> 3:56:57.200]  about it like this you could have easily had three four five members of the republican party murdered
[3:56:57.200 --> 3:57:03.200]  that day i mean honestly by the grace of god that didn't happen i mean honestly we should be
[3:57:03.200 --> 3:57:11.440]  thanking god by the grace of god nobody died that day honestly folks that is the this person could
[3:57:11.440 --> 3:57:17.200]  have killed up to five or more people that day and think about how different their story would be
[3:57:17.200 --> 3:57:22.320]  think about how different america would be if that guy actually as the new protester said had
[3:57:22.320 --> 3:57:27.520]  better aim he would have killed multiple people luckily for the democrats i guess at this point
[3:57:29.040 --> 3:57:35.600]  unless you're an average democrat constituent apparently nobody did die so they get to continue
[3:57:35.600 --> 3:57:40.720]  their extreme rhetoric they did get to continue to push violence but so now they arrest another
[3:57:40.720 --> 3:57:46.160]  protester who says well we failed at trying to assassinate republicans last time so we're just
[3:57:46.160 --> 3:57:51.120]  going to get better aim and then we're going to be victorious so i can only assume that this guy
[3:57:53.200 --> 3:58:02.080]  was going to i guess plan well he was planning a sit-in at the uh at the office to demand
[3:58:03.120 --> 3:58:10.160]  a better care reconciliation act so folks oh by the way steve scolese has just been
[3:58:10.160 --> 3:58:16.480]  readmitted to the hospital because of an infection so i'm just curious when is maxine waters when is
[3:58:16.480 --> 3:58:23.920]  cnn when is msnbc when is uh rachel mad cow when is van jones when is don levin when are the
[3:58:23.920 --> 3:58:28.080]  qualmo brothers when are all these people that have been calling for violence against trump the
[3:58:28.080 --> 3:58:32.880]  new york public theater when are they going to disavow the violence being called for by the left
[3:58:32.880 --> 3:58:37.360]  when are they going to admit that they're lucky multiple republicans weren't murdered you say
[3:58:37.360 --> 3:58:46.960]  classical this is gcn the genesis communications radio network
