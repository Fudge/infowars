[00:00.000 --> 00:09.000]  media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN
[00:09.000 --> 00:37.840]  Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome and thank you for joining us today, the 15th
[00:37.840 --> 00:56.520]  day of July 2008. We're going to be live here for the next four hours. I had him on Sunday, I had him on Monday, and he's back on today coming up in one hour to continue to break down and analyze and track chronicle what we're seeing in the meltdown of the world financial
[00:56.520 --> 01:21.880]  system by design. Bob Chapman today. Dr. Stan Monteef to talk about the New World Order depopulation agenda will be with us in the fourth hour today. And yes, we will have open phones throughout the broadcast. But I first today want to put the phone number out only for
[01:21.880 --> 01:47.880]  peace officers, police, I guess you call yourselves law enforcement, because I need to know something. When we get back, I will tell you what that is. And I would hope you would call in and confirm something for me. So that is coming up. I'll put that question out coming up after the first break here in just a few minutes.
[01:47.880 --> 02:05.880]  Things are worsening faster than I had even thought they would. And that's unfortunate. It's unfortunate. Any of this is happening. But I wish we had more time. US stocks are in retreat as crude oil tumbles by more than $9.
[02:05.880 --> 02:25.880]  Dollar falls to record versus euro credit woes may dampen and growth. What type of headline is that they're still talking about a growing economy feeding people the cyanide lace Kool-Aid wholesale inflation is worse in 27 years.
[02:25.880 --> 02:43.880]  Banks hit by fallout from crisis at Indie Mac. Other banks are having runs, especially on the West Coast. We'll go over some of that. Fed chief details problems in markets, housing and jobs. He's doing that right now, still testifying right now.
[02:43.880 --> 02:59.880]  Another report by ABC News. Who's next? A list of troubled banks, worries, Wall Street and DC. We'll go over some of those. They're saying Wachovia could go under any minute.
[02:59.880 --> 03:11.880]  Paramount is forced to spend $450 million in financing. And there's scores of stories like this today where financing is falling through for some of the biggest corporations out there.
[03:11.880 --> 03:26.880]  Meanwhile, the Arabs fear fallout of nuclear conflict. Well, how dare them? I mean, our hijacked government says they're going to hit them with nukes if they fight back when they're hit with conventional weapons and just be like the American people.
[03:26.880 --> 03:35.880]  Just decide that radiation is good for you and die of cancer. That's what our troops have been told. I mean, that's what we've been told here. It's good for you. It's not bad.
[03:35.880 --> 03:41.880]  Sodium fluoride's good in your water. Mercury's good for you. Radiation's good for you. It was good for the kids around Chernobyl.
[03:41.880 --> 03:47.880]  And what's wrong with you? Conspiracy theorist. Not wanting hundreds of nukes to rain down in your country.
[03:47.880 --> 03:58.880]  Nearby countries don't want to breathe all of that. What? You're some kind of crazy person. Conspiracy theorist. Everybody knows fallout's good for you.
[03:58.880 --> 04:07.880]  Man, you people are crazy. Man, you're as crazy as those people say in the dollars dropping in value. There's no inflation. Everything's fine.
[04:07.880 --> 04:12.880]  Sick of all these crazy conspiracy theorists. Just getting crazier and crazier.
[04:12.880 --> 04:32.880]  Florida water now reaches nearly 70% of U.S. population. This put out by the CDC. Your forced medication. Also, Salt Lake City Tribune, worse than adult prisoners, U.S. tortures and murder of children in Iraqi jails.
[04:32.880 --> 04:39.880]  Well, what's wrong with that? That's Christian. Conyers, the Democrat whore, is saying no impeachment of Lord Bush.
[04:39.880 --> 04:51.880]  Well, sure, it's all part of the same operation. Police to inject you on the side of the road now. NBC reporting with amnesia drugs. I'm not kidding. It's all coming up.

[05:54.880 --> 06:01.880]  Even terrible gas prices don't come close to the disaster of food costs from shortages already destroying millions of American families.
[06:01.880 --> 06:09.880]  Wheat for flour is already four times more expensive than it was about a year ago. Food costs continue to double because there's no food worldwide.

[07:10.880 --> 07:18.880]  Our founding fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered. The protein powder, seeds and oil are available through hempusa.org.

[07:52.880 --> 08:18.880]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[08:26.880 --> 08:34.880]  We are back live now into the second segment. Bob Chapman with Continuing Economic Analysis coming up in the next hour.
[08:34.880 --> 08:42.880]  Open phones throughout the day and of course in the fourth hour today Dr. Stan Monteev on the Globalist Depopulation Program.
[08:42.880 --> 09:09.880]  Now, I just wanted to, in the first 30 minutes while I cover news, I want to throw out this toll free number only for police officers or people inside the state police who are in the clerical areas of the data areas who know whether this is the case or not.
[09:09.880 --> 09:19.880]  Yeah, I know it was two legislative sessions ago, but they've had so many special sessions, I mean two main sessions. So it was about four years ago, we have them every two years in Texas.
[09:19.880 --> 09:34.880]  And I got a call from a listener saying the DPS is proposing having a database on anyone who's criticized local or state police so that when they pull you over, they know your political views.
[09:34.880 --> 09:46.880]  Now, I went and looked it up and sure enough that was a bill introduced. It did not pass that session. I know it was reintroduced and I lost track of it in other sessions.
[09:46.880 --> 10:13.880]  Now, I tried to Google it, only spent about 30, 40 minutes on it last night, couldn't find it. It was four years ago, I couldn't remember the exact headlines or the name of the bill. So I don't know if it passed. And in the mid and late 70s, it turned out that several hundred thousand people in Texas, pastors, mainline people, anyone who had any pull with the community.
[10:13.880 --> 10:26.880]  We're talking Nazi slash Stasi slash Soviet Union database. The state police criminally in Texas had one of the worst databases in the world. I mean, it made the Russians look like good guys.
[10:26.880 --> 10:46.880]  And it was on everybody, basically of any import, pastors, community leaders, people that groveled to them, people that didn't. And that was in the DPS intelligence bureau's database, just absolutely criminal, absolutely un-American.
[10:46.880 --> 10:58.880]  Now they got sued, there were federal lawsuits, and they supposedly quit having it. What they tried to get passed into law four years ago would have codified the criminal activities we know they continue.
[10:58.880 --> 11:13.880]  But I will be stunned and amazed if, by the way, it was ruled to be criminal. I will be stunned and amazed if they were actually able to pass it. But I can't keep track of everything.
[11:13.880 --> 11:27.880]  My father, my dad has a compulsion against buying anything. And he had this old car about 10 years old that was breaking down with time. So I basically sold him for nothing.
[11:27.880 --> 11:35.880]  My dad's not rich, but he has money. He just won't buy anything. It isn't that he's even a spin thrift. He just doesn't buy things. He doesn't like buying things.
[11:35.880 --> 11:44.880]  I've seen him with holes in his shoes before and bought him shoes. And again, he grew up on a farm where they bought stuff out of a catalog and he doesn't like going to the store.
[11:44.880 --> 11:53.880]  And unless it's guns or fishing poles, that's about all they'll buy or tools. You know, just classic hillbilly. But I mean, he's not a hillbilly. He's a dentist.
[11:53.880 --> 12:00.880]  But the point is, he's from hillbilly stock. He won't buy anything. So make a long story short. I don't know why I told that part of the story.
[12:00.880 --> 12:12.880]  I sold him a five year old car that we had and got my wife a new one, a little sedan, a Passat.
[12:12.880 --> 12:19.880]  I basically made him buy it from me because his car was broken down most of the time in the shop all the time. He was walking to work.
[12:19.880 --> 12:25.880]  I'm not joking. He was walking to work. He only lives about a half mile away from work.
[12:25.880 --> 12:35.880]  And so, long story short, my dad is driving my car and I sold him about two months ago. He hasn't changed the registration over yet.
[12:35.880 --> 12:44.880]  He's driving through a small town and in my dad's such a nice guy, he doesn't want me to mention the town. He doesn't want any heat on the police officer that pulled him over.
[12:44.880 --> 12:53.880]  No doubt the town has plate scanning systems. That's what it sounds like most towns do. A lot of towns themselves are now accessing it.
[12:53.880 --> 13:01.880]  And so my dad's driving 65 coming back from our ranch in East Texas, Family Land on some business.
[13:01.880 --> 13:08.880]  He's coming back Sunday night about 10 o'clock at night in Franklin.
[13:08.880 --> 13:14.880]  And I'm not going to get into the officer's name and everything because he just gave him a warning ticket and my dad was supposedly speeding.
[13:14.880 --> 13:19.880]  It's where the highway goes through a town and it goes from 65 to 45. Didn't give him a ticket. They wait 10 minutes.
[13:19.880 --> 13:25.880]  They come up to the car all scared and they say, well, you're not Alex Jones.
[13:25.880 --> 13:31.880]  And my dad says, no, no, this is his car. I just bought it.
[13:31.880 --> 13:38.880]  And they said, well, our database shows that you're a handle with care. In fact, I wrote a note yesterday when he was here in the office.
[13:38.880 --> 13:41.880]  I'm going to get the exact term.
[13:41.880 --> 13:50.880]  Flagged for special handling. That's what he was told flagged for special handling.
[13:50.880 --> 13:56.880]  And my dad's like, well, what does that mean? And they just said, well, oh, by the way, I'm a fan of your son's radio show.
[13:56.880 --> 14:04.880]  And it was an older police officer with a younger police officer there in the town.
[14:04.880 --> 14:11.880]  And so, I mean, are we in such a secret police system that I don't even know the databases are active now?
[14:11.880 --> 14:18.880]  I mean, I know I'm in the DPS intelligence files. I know I've asked the FBI repeatedly for my FBI file.
[14:18.880 --> 14:24.880]  They will not give it to me. They're supposed to by federal law, but this is a criminal government. They're not giving it to me.
[14:24.880 --> 14:28.880]  I've got to go through some procedure to try to force them to give it to me. I'm sure it's so big.
[14:28.880 --> 14:36.880]  I don't want to have to excise and block it all out. I mean, I want to make a news piece out of it.
[14:36.880 --> 14:45.880]  But see, I've been pulled over.
[14:45.880 --> 14:51.880]  And when the police pulled me over, they act like I'm some 14 headed monster when they come up to the car.
[14:51.880 --> 15:00.880]  And when I do get pulled over now, and it's the state police that have pulled me over a couple of times in the last year or so.
[15:00.880 --> 15:06.880]  Now, I know that the cities tie into the state police database. It's also tied into the federal's.
[15:06.880 --> 15:11.880]  Can someone call in here and tell me, or you're not allowed to talk about that.
[15:11.880 --> 15:15.880]  Is it such a secret police America that you're not supposed to tell us?
[15:15.880 --> 15:25.880]  I mean, you're not supposed to run our place without probable cause, but we know the license plate reading systems that do go into a database of, quote, warrants.
[15:25.880 --> 15:33.880]  You know, we know that's been federally up for 10 years, and now they're telling the police about it in the last two years, upgrading and letting them know.
[15:33.880 --> 15:44.880]  In the fusion centers, the emergency management centers, the threat integration centers, the local federalization command bases that have national guards, state police, local police, sheriff department in them.
[15:44.880 --> 15:53.880]  Now that state police call in and go, I thought you were crazy, but they are telling us that we're federal now and we got to follow the orders of the president and not the governor.
[15:53.880 --> 16:00.880]  Well, and I know you got slack training and all this other training and FEMA comes in and tells you the founding fathers were terrorist.
[16:00.880 --> 16:09.880]  I mean, I have it on video in Kansas City, the police and state police and local police and firemen all being taught the founding fathers are evil and Christians are evil.
[16:09.880 --> 16:19.880]  I mean, you can't make this up. And I have state police pulling people over in their own squad car videos at checkpoints and they find a pocket constitution and they freak out and start breathing heavy.
[16:19.880 --> 16:28.880]  It's in road to tyranny. They start, look, she's got the paraphernalia and the guy's going, oh my God, oh my God, is she allowed to have this?
[16:28.880 --> 16:35.880]  And the other commander comes over and goes, I think she may be allowed to have that.
[16:35.880 --> 16:45.880]  It's like satire. It's like some type of Kurt Vonnegut book about a future police state where the police are heavy breathing over finding a pocket constitution.
[16:45.880 --> 16:52.880]  Then they found one of my videos, police state 2000 and folks, it was all over. She was going to jail.
[16:52.880 --> 17:07.880]  So, so I just want to make sure and confirm that, that I am flagged as some type of dangerous miscreant.
[17:07.880 --> 17:14.880]  I've been arrested a few protests and they've always dropped the charges because they knew it was violation of civil rights. They don't want me to sue them.
[17:14.880 --> 17:32.880]  Long time the state police did arrest me in a thumb scanning protest in 97. The guy apologized, pulled over, said he was a Christian, took my handcuffs off and took me into the Austin jail where I got roughed up by the five foot one redheaded guy who enjoyed shoving my head in the wall a couple times.
[17:32.880 --> 17:42.880]  But that was my experience there for nothing. It was just get up against the wall and then a little extra dribble my head off the wall a couple times.
[17:42.880 --> 17:54.880]  It would only let me know you were a pile of dog, you know what on the ground boy. You think it hurt me that you pushed my head in the wall and made me feel sorry for you, what it missed me like to be a coward.
[17:54.880 --> 18:05.880]  And then nobody who makes all the other, I guess jailers, police, whatever you want to call them look bad, but I'm already digressing. I forgive you for that.
[18:05.880 --> 18:11.880]  You're the one taking mercury shots drinking fluoride and loving your government and having your dollar devalued.
[18:11.880 --> 18:23.880]  The point is that I need you to call in and tell me about this little database or was this town subscribing to some federal database.
[18:23.880 --> 18:28.880]  I know some of them do and some of them don't. There's a lot of stuff going on.
[18:28.880 --> 18:38.880]  1-800-259-9231. I don't care if you're the state police in Maine, the state police in Kansas or Missouri or Oklahoma or Texas or the local police.
[18:38.880 --> 18:45.880]  I want to know. I mean, I know they proposed it in Texas and last time I checked it didn't pass.
[18:45.880 --> 18:54.880]  Or listeners, if you can dig in and find it in the state code by any state, call in and let me know.
[18:54.880 --> 19:01.880]  Needless to say, my dad is hurrying to get that registration officially changed out of my name.
[19:01.880 --> 19:09.880]  They walked over and looked at him and said, is this your car? You're not Alex Jones.
[19:09.880 --> 19:19.880]  Oh, man. Oh, it's amazing. Absolutely amazing.
[19:19.880 --> 19:25.880]  So we will come back and I'll get into the bankers pulling the plug on all of us.
[19:25.880 --> 19:40.880]  Doesn't matter if you're a black man, an Hispanic, white, purple, green. Doesn't matter if you're a cop, a school teacher, an auto mechanic, a farmer, a rancher, an insurance salesman, a dentist, a nurse, a jail guard.
[19:40.880 --> 19:44.880]  You're getting right by the New World Order and it's going to get a lot worse.
[19:44.880 --> 19:52.880]  There's a way out of this. If you'll wake up and smell the coffee, if you don't, we're done. It's up to you.
[19:52.880 --> 19:58.880]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources, July 14, 2008. Gold opened at 962.40.
[19:58.880 --> 20:05.880]  One ounce gold coins can be purchased for $989.81, $487.40 for half ounce and $243.70 for quarter ounce.
[20:05.880 --> 20:08.880]  That's $989.81, $487.40, $243.70.
[20:08.880 --> 20:15.880]  70% of China's one trillion reserves are in dollar, now purchasing 250,000 barrels of oil per day from Iran in Euro.
[20:15.880 --> 20:20.880]  Japanese refiners buy 550,000 barrels, switching dollar to yen. Bad news for U.S. currency.
[20:20.880 --> 20:24.880]  China and Japan hold large positions in dollar. Trading equals permanent loss.
[20:24.880 --> 20:27.880]  Dollars fall into 65% of Euro. Erosion accelerates.
[20:27.880 --> 20:32.880]  Countries despise imperialistic policy of U.S. loss of confidence causing more selling.
[20:32.880 --> 20:35.880]  GAO is warning about the debt spiraling out of control.
[20:35.880 --> 20:40.880]  Why attack Iran? Jerome O'Corsies. Iran leads attack against the U.S. dollar document spells it out.
[20:40.880 --> 20:46.880]  Call 800-686-2237. The value of your hard-earned money is being destroyed in a global game of chess.
[20:46.880 --> 20:53.880]  Call 800-686-2237 for Corsies Report today. That's 800-686-2237.
[20:53.880 --> 20:57.880]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[20:57.880 --> 21:02.880]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor, even though we're paying record prices at the pump.
[21:02.880 --> 21:07.880]  I have run across a company called SFR who has developed two products that improve gas mileage.
[21:07.880 --> 21:11.880]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system,
[21:11.880 --> 21:18.880]  protect a complete fuel system treatment, cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage, and only one tank full.
[21:18.880 --> 21:23.880]  Protect an engine treatment not only reduces friction, but it extends the life of your engine.
[21:23.880 --> 21:27.880]  Let's face it, with the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action.
[21:27.880 --> 21:35.880]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment, which is a $12.95 value free.
[21:35.880 --> 21:44.880]  Call 0888, use SFR-1. That number again is 0888, use SFR-1, or check them out online at oilcompanysecret.com.
[21:44.880 --> 21:53.880]  That's oilcompanysecret.com. Satisfaction is guaranteed, or your money back, and it's safe for all cars. Act now.
[21:53.880 --> 22:00.880]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job.
[22:00.880 --> 22:03.880]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[22:03.880 --> 22:10.880]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state? It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CFR.
[22:10.880 --> 22:12.880]  Release the eyeshadow.
[22:12.880 --> 22:19.880]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[22:19.880 --> 22:25.880]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[22:25.880 --> 22:29.880]  An inside job? How dare you?
[22:29.880 --> 22:35.880]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[22:35.880 --> 22:38.880]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[22:38.880 --> 22:44.880]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[22:53.880 --> 22:56.880]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[22:56.880 --> 23:02.880]  First, I get the best parking space at work. Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[23:02.880 --> 23:05.880]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney.
[23:05.880 --> 23:09.880]  Finalized a contract in London and demoed our new product in Boston.
[23:09.880 --> 23:15.880]  Online from my desk with WebEx. WebEx lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[23:15.880 --> 23:20.880]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[23:20.880 --> 23:24.880]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.

[23:58.880 --> 24:02.880]  Let me give you the toll free number out to police officers or anybody that works in state
[24:02.880 --> 24:06.880]  or local government around the country that knows about these databases.
[24:06.880 --> 24:09.880]  I know the feds have put millions of Americans in them.
[24:09.880 --> 24:15.880]  Some of the senior air marshals went public a year and a half ago in the Denver Post
[24:15.880 --> 24:20.880]  saying they're ordered every month to put innocent people, children, women for no reason.
[24:20.880 --> 24:23.880]  They just have to put people in the terrorism database.
[24:23.880 --> 24:28.880]  There's also a crime database that's got millions into people who aren't even convicted criminals.
[24:28.880 --> 24:33.880]  And we know the state police in Texas wanted to put you in there, watch what you say and what you do,
[24:33.880 --> 24:39.880]  and then create a stasi political file that all their officers access.
[24:39.880 --> 24:45.880]  And that's just classic tyranny. So I'm trying to find out what this officer was talking about.
[24:45.880 --> 24:54.880]  Flagged for special handling when my dad got pulled over driving a car he bought from me in Texas Sunday night.
[24:54.880 --> 25:02.880]  1-800-259-9231. And there's no caller ID on the Genesis phones.
[25:02.880 --> 25:06.880]  There is no, we're not going to know where you're calling from, who you are.
[25:06.880 --> 25:09.880]  And I'll just track what you say off the info you give me.
[25:09.880 --> 25:17.880]  I'll try to Google those key terms and confirm it that way. 1-800-259-9231. Here it is.
[25:17.880 --> 25:22.880]  You're driving along your squad car or you're off work and you need to write that number down to call me.
[25:22.880 --> 25:28.880]  1-800-259-9231. We'll cover financial news and all that key stuff after this.
[25:28.880 --> 25:35.880]  This is important to look at. Jim says he's a former officer calling in from Texas. Jim, what do you know about this?
[25:35.880 --> 25:40.880]  Well, Alex, if you want to put Google to work, try Google and NCIC.
[25:40.880 --> 25:46.880]  Well, I know about the NCIC, but that's supposedly, you know, that federal grid tied into all the states and locals
[25:46.880 --> 25:56.880]  supposed to only have, you know, the criminal records there or who's got warrants or traffic records, correct?
[25:56.880 --> 26:00.880]  Yeah, I'm not going to go too in depth, you know, just to protect myself and my family.
[26:00.880 --> 26:07.880]  But let me just give you a little preface of what I did. I was a police officer down post-Katrina in an area that I'm not going to mention.
[26:07.880 --> 26:13.880]  And let me tell you right now, they've got all the new towers they came in for communication for the police departments.
[26:13.880 --> 26:18.880]  All the new towers they installed were unscanable.
[26:18.880 --> 26:23.880]  Basically, we communicate with free talk. We didn't have to speak in code.
[26:23.880 --> 26:29.880]  We communicated free talk and it was unscanable to the civilian populace.
[26:29.880 --> 26:33.880]  I understand that, but you're saying this is a free country.
[26:33.880 --> 26:38.880]  The people are supposed to know what these computers are doing. No one's going to come, you know, get you for talking about this.
[26:38.880 --> 26:44.880]  If we do have this attitude, and I appreciate you calling, having the courage to call, then we're already in an atmosphere of tyranny.
[26:44.880 --> 26:49.880]  I mean, I'm asking, do you know about databases? You know, you say you're in Louisiana.
[26:49.880 --> 26:56.880]  Do you know about, or in Texas now, do you know about databases where it says handle with care?
[26:56.880 --> 27:03.880]  I didn't have any experience with it myself, but a good friend of mine who in the department was U.S. Marshall, an adjutant for them.
[27:03.880 --> 27:10.880]  He could basically get all that kind of information, special care instructions, like you were speaking of earlier.
[27:10.880 --> 27:16.880]  And it was 15 seconds of wait time for him when he was on the phone with dispatch.
[27:16.880 --> 27:22.880]  I mean, 15, but Alex Jones has no criminal record.
[27:22.880 --> 27:29.880]  I mean, that's my point here is this is despicable. You know, you're dealing with somebody who's dangerous, handle with care.
[27:29.880 --> 27:36.880]  I mean, and now my wife and children are driving around in cars and the cops flip out on them.
[27:36.880 --> 27:40.880]  I mean, my point is, is that this is not a free country when this stuff's going on.
[27:40.880 --> 27:45.880]  Well, I also called today to point out one thing I thought you might find interesting.
[27:45.880 --> 27:50.880]  I'm currently in the military now. I was reading the Army Times the other day, and they pointed out that they need,
[27:50.880 --> 27:54.880]  in mass numbers, patriot missile operators.
[27:54.880 --> 27:58.880]  I don't know what good that is for you, but that was, I believe it was the May issue.
[27:58.880 --> 28:02.880]  So they're running up the numbers of these patriot missile operators.
[28:02.880 --> 28:06.880]  So they can protect Israel for a strike. And I did see that. That's a good point.
[28:06.880 --> 28:10.880]  Okay. I just want to bring it up to you. And I want to thank you for everything that you do.
[28:10.880 --> 28:13.880]  You know, God bless you and keep up the good work.
[28:13.880 --> 28:15.880]  Well, thank you, Jim.
[28:15.880 --> 28:20.880]  So, so did, I mean, did you go out of the military into policing and then back in the military?
[28:20.880 --> 28:25.880]  Yeah, that's, that's what happened to me. I was caught. I was wiped out by the hurricane myself.
[28:25.880 --> 28:29.880]  And I just got out of the military, decided to become a police officer.
[28:29.880 --> 28:35.880]  And then after, after that had transpired, I saw some things that I didn't want to deal with for the rest of my life.
[28:35.880 --> 28:42.880]  So the military offered a pretty safe security blank for me to just fall right back into.
[28:42.880 --> 28:47.880]  So I'm here now and, you know, just, just trying to hang in there, I guess.
[28:47.880 --> 28:50.880]  Are you going to be sent back to Iraq?
[28:50.880 --> 28:55.880]  Well, I pray that, that I won't be, but you know, you never know what's going to happen.
[28:55.880 --> 28:58.880]  So what's the word? Are they saying there's going to be a hit on Iran?
[28:58.880 --> 29:03.880]  I mean, the president just said three days ago, he said, I, I authorized Israel.
[29:03.880 --> 29:05.880]  Israel has my support.
[29:05.880 --> 29:08.880]  Yeah, I can't really go into semantics about that.
[29:08.880 --> 29:18.880]  But, uh, I mean, just, uh, whatever you're reading, like I shared that Army Times bit with you and, uh, you know, all the other information you presented past couple weeks.
[29:18.880 --> 29:23.880]  Uh, yeah, my educator guess would be yes, my non-professional opinion. Yeah.
[29:23.880 --> 29:26.880]  Yeah. All right. Thank you so much for the call.
[29:26.880 --> 29:32.880]  I'm going to come back with financial news and other info, but 1-800-25-992-31.
[29:32.880 --> 29:39.880]  I mean, so the database is in effect or where your political views are on the computer screen.
[29:39.880 --> 29:43.880]  We know they have the Army spying on peacecribs.
[29:43.880 --> 29:47.880]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[29:47.880 --> 29:53.880]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[29:53.880 --> 29:55.880]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[29:55.880 --> 30:01.880]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide, but in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[30:01.880 --> 30:04.880]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[30:04.880 --> 30:10.880]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[30:10.880 --> 30:14.880]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[31:57.880 --> 32:02.880]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[32:02.880 --> 32:07.880]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.

[48:21.880 --> 48:28.880]  And I do want to hear from others on this subject.
[48:28.880 --> 48:37.880]  It's very, very painful to see all of this happening and understand under this new system things that haven't been crimes will be crimes.
[48:37.880 --> 48:49.880]  That's why they have to now say there's no Fourth Amendment and set that precedent so all this info and disinfo and a lot of the stuff in the databases they admit is wrong can be used against you.
[48:49.880 --> 49:00.880]  But the key here is to put a lot of disinfo into the databases because there's already a lot of disinfo to further discredit them.
[49:00.880 --> 49:11.880]  Speaking of data, I wrongly predicted yesterday I said I think Jesse Ventura, he has a lot of courage.
[49:11.880 --> 49:23.880]  He went on air and said 9-11 is an inside job basically on this show. I think Jesse Ventura will announce tomorrow or tonight and I was wrong.
[49:23.880 --> 49:34.880]  And I begged him, I pushed him, he said well you're convincing but he does have a sick daughter who doesn't with all the chemical weapon attacks going on.
[49:34.880 --> 49:41.880]  And his wife doesn't want him to run and you can hear he's cynical, he thinks the country is completely gone.
[49:41.880 --> 49:47.880]  And at the end of the interview, as soon as the interview ended and I came back and talked about it, we talked about it here in the office.
[49:47.880 --> 49:53.880]  I said okay I guess I'm wrong, he's not going to run for Senate.
[49:53.880 --> 50:00.880]  Because at the end he said alright Alex I'll come back on your show before I go back to Mexico because I talked to him behind the scenes and said hey I want to get you back on.
[50:00.880 --> 50:04.880]  Hey did you get the films I sent you, yeah, truth rising.
[50:04.880 --> 50:12.880]  I said will you come back on before you either run for this during the race or before you go back to Mexico and he said yeah, I'll come on before I go to Mexico.
[50:12.880 --> 50:16.880]  And then he said it right as he left, the last thing he said was, we ought to queue that up and play it later.
[50:16.880 --> 50:26.880]  He said yeah, I'll come back on your show before I go to Mexico.
[50:26.880 --> 50:37.880]  And you know Jesse Ventura wasn't going to save the world but the point is having him run for the Senate, he'd have been in the media talking about the police state or how they're destroying the dollar by design like he did on Larry King Live last night.
[50:37.880 --> 50:42.880]  By the way there's no doubt he picked up a lot of the stuff we've been teaching him.
[50:42.880 --> 50:48.880]  He was a different guy last night talking about the elites engineering the dollar collapse and a lot more.
[50:48.880 --> 50:52.880]  We definitely got our info on Larry King Live last night through Ventura.
[50:52.880 --> 50:59.880]  Hey Bonnie, no more pickpocketing for us. I have an easier way we can steal people's credit cards without even knowing they've been robbed.
[50:59.880 --> 51:01.880]  How so Clyde?
[51:01.880 --> 51:05.880]  I have this RFID reader I picked up on the internet just by waving it near you.
[51:05.880 --> 51:09.880]  I can skim your credit card information while your cards are still in your purse. Just watch.
[51:09.880 --> 51:13.880]  Hey look, that's my info on the screen. You gotta be kidding me.
[51:13.880 --> 51:20.880]  Nope, with 50 million credit cards with hidden RFID chips, I figure we'll make a fortune as long as people don't hear about identity stronghold.
[51:20.880 --> 51:23.880]  Why? What's identity stronghold?
[51:23.880 --> 51:28.880]  They make the secure sleeve. When people keep their credit cards in the shielded secure sleeve, I can't read them.
[51:28.880 --> 51:31.880]  Do a lot of people already know about the secure sleeve?
[51:31.880 --> 51:35.880]  No way. Most people don't realize they even have chips in their credit cards and passports.
[51:35.880 --> 51:38.880]  Clyde, we should get some of those secure sleeves.
[51:38.880 --> 51:41.880]  I already got some. I also got some to fit our passports.
[51:41.880 --> 51:46.880]  Identity stronghold has secure sleeves for sale right on the internet at idstronghold.com.
[51:46.880 --> 51:48.880]  idstronghold.com?
[51:48.880 --> 51:53.880]  Right, or you can call them at 1-800-610-2770.
[51:53.880 --> 51:58.880]  Question, is the world getting better or vastly worse?
[51:58.880 --> 52:03.880]  The world economic collapse could come any day.
[52:03.880 --> 52:08.880]  Question, are you prepared or are you ignoring the signs?
[52:08.880 --> 52:14.880]  Question, do you have seven years of healthy food for your family?

[52:48.880 --> 52:53.880]  Do it now or become property of the New World Order.
[52:53.880 --> 52:58.880]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops,
[52:58.880 --> 53:01.880]  I went to Ground Zero and we knew what to do.
[53:01.880 --> 53:03.880]  Or at least we thought we did.
[53:03.880 --> 53:09.880]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[53:09.880 --> 53:18.880]  Whitman, EPA director on the AT, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[53:18.880 --> 53:25.880]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[53:25.880 --> 53:29.880]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[53:29.880 --> 53:34.880]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[53:34.880 --> 53:41.880]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide. Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv
[53:41.880 --> 53:46.880]  and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[53:46.880 --> 53:52.880]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[53:52.880 --> 53:57.880]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now.
[53:57.880 --> 54:07.880]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now.
[54:07.880 --> 54:16.880]  Folks, the evil, the scale of the surveillance, the criminality is over the top.
[54:16.880 --> 54:19.880]  They're going for broke.
[54:19.880 --> 54:25.880]  They plan to stage more terror attacks to get you hurt into compact cities.
[54:25.880 --> 54:29.880]  And then they're going to nerve gas you and your family.
[54:29.880 --> 54:33.880]  Everything I've told you has come true so far.
[54:33.880 --> 54:38.880]  Don't be sitting there 5, 10, 15 years from now.
[54:38.880 --> 54:42.880]  When they execute their main plan that they've said they're going to execute,
[54:42.880 --> 54:47.880]  when you've got 30 seconds till you're dead thinking, oh my God, Alex Jones was right.
[54:47.880 --> 54:51.880]  As you see aircraft and helicopters flying over, flown by foreign operatives,
[54:51.880 --> 54:54.880]  and you're grabbing your throat going, Alex Jones was right.
[54:54.880 --> 54:57.880]  I mean, it's not a joke, ladies and gentlemen.
[54:57.880 --> 55:00.880]  They are going to murder you and your family.
[55:00.880 --> 55:03.880]  This is not your government.
[55:03.880 --> 55:07.880]  The only reason I'm still alive is because they don't want to kill me
[55:07.880 --> 55:11.880]  because that will put a punctuation mark, a highlight,
[55:11.880 --> 55:16.880]  an underlining through everything I have to say.
[55:16.880 --> 55:20.880]  It will light it up like neon.
[55:20.880 --> 55:24.880]  You see, I can't enjoy things anymore, ladies and gentlemen,
[55:24.880 --> 55:27.880]  because I can't take off, I can't read a book, watch a movie.
[55:27.880 --> 55:29.880]  All I think about is this.
[55:29.880 --> 55:30.880]  How could you not?
[55:30.880 --> 55:34.880]  How could you go back when you know the truth?
[55:34.880 --> 55:39.880]  And then I get mad at my shelf because I haven't done a very good job at reaching out to people.
[55:39.880 --> 55:43.880]  I am human, I am flawed, I am so angry.
[55:43.880 --> 55:46.880]  I look at my children every day so innocent and good,
[55:46.880 --> 55:52.880]  and I think about the black-hearted bastards destroying our society, and I go into a rage.
[55:52.880 --> 55:54.880]  And I see our fellow people in the, quote,
[55:54.880 --> 55:57.880]  patriot movement, a lot of them have no idea how bad it is,
[55:57.880 --> 56:01.880]  or their slack job, or their own power trips, or they're into their own egos,
[56:01.880 --> 56:06.880]  their own little operations, and it upsets me because we need every able-bodied person focused
[56:06.880 --> 56:07.880]  on what's really going on.
[56:07.880 --> 56:11.880]  See, people hear my anger and my focus and my roar, and they think it's an ego.
[56:11.880 --> 56:12.880]  It's the opposite of ego, folks.
[56:12.880 --> 56:14.880]  It is total resistance.
[56:14.880 --> 56:16.880]  Does that mean I resist things properly?
[56:16.880 --> 56:20.880]  Does that mean I do a good job? No.
[56:20.880 --> 56:25.880]  I turn off most of the police instead of reaching out to them properly and showing them how they've been manipulated
[56:25.880 --> 56:28.880]  because I had a primitive level of threaten by them,
[56:28.880 --> 56:31.880]  because I understand they're brainwashed zombies of the New World Order.
[56:31.880 --> 56:36.880]  So instead of unlocking the zombies, I tend to just enrage the zombies.
[56:36.880 --> 56:38.880]  It's the same thing with the illegal aliens.
[56:38.880 --> 56:39.880]  I don't personally dislike them.
[56:39.880 --> 56:43.880]  I know they're being used as a tool to destroy my country and destroy themselves,
[56:43.880 --> 56:47.880]  and so I get at a primitive level threatened by it and start hopping up and down.
[56:47.880 --> 56:48.880]  But I can't help it.
[56:48.880 --> 56:52.880]  That's who I am.
[56:52.880 --> 56:54.880]  And I just hear that guy saying everything I already knew,
[56:54.880 --> 56:58.880]  but that I'd never even consciously put into my own understanding.
[56:58.880 --> 56:59.880]  You understand, folks?
[56:59.880 --> 57:00.880]  That's why I freak out.
[57:00.880 --> 57:06.880]  If I could describe to you how bad it is, how sick it is, how they are killing you with the vaccines,
[57:06.880 --> 57:09.880]  do you understand me, government people?
[57:09.880 --> 57:16.880]  There is no doubt that when your child is dying at 15 years of age from diabetes
[57:16.880 --> 57:21.880]  or dying from bizarre onset of some autoimmune disease or leukemia,
[57:21.880 --> 57:26.880]  that black ops killed your child.
[57:26.880 --> 57:30.880]  When your son comes back 23 years old from Iraq from three tours
[57:30.880 --> 57:35.880]  and his muscles dissolve and his guts liquefy and come out as high and dead,
[57:35.880 --> 57:38.880]  he was killed by the New World Order.
[57:38.880 --> 57:40.880]  And it's going on all around us.
[57:40.880 --> 57:43.880]  And I, for one, have had enough of it.
[57:43.880 --> 57:45.880]  This doesn't have to happen.
[57:45.880 --> 57:50.880]  This electronic cage built by these psycho-engineers doesn't have to succeed
[57:50.880 --> 57:52.880]  if you'll just wake up to it and get motivated.
[57:52.880 --> 57:57.880]  But the horror is so bad, a lot of you can't handle it.
[57:57.880 --> 57:59.880]  I'm going to hold him over and we're going to get Chapman on.
[57:59.880 --> 58:02.880]  Zane and Tennessee's in the military knows about databases.
[58:02.880 --> 58:04.880]  Go ahead, Zane.
[58:04.880 --> 58:06.880]  Yes, Alex.
[58:06.880 --> 58:07.880]  I don't actually work on databases.
[58:07.880 --> 58:10.880]  I was just going to comment that when I was over there,
[58:10.880 --> 58:13.880]  we got pulled over because they got actual police officers patrolling
[58:13.880 --> 58:16.880]  to make sure you're not speeding in Iraq.
[58:16.880 --> 58:23.880]  And one of my soldiers got pulled over and they ran his license back to the states.
[58:23.880 --> 58:27.880]  I didn't even know that was possible for my rack.
[58:27.880 --> 58:28.880]  Of course it is.
[58:28.880 --> 58:29.880]  Everything.
[58:29.880 --> 58:32.880]  Every pizza he eats, every pack of cigarettes he buys, stay there.

[58:43.880 --> 58:45.880]  It is a big idea.
[58:45.880 --> 58:47.880]  A new world order.
[58:47.880 --> 58:52.880]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[58:52.880 --> 58:55.880]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[58:55.880 --> 58:58.880]  Could their objective be world domination?
[58:58.880 --> 59:01.880]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[59:01.880 --> 59:04.880]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[59:04.880 --> 59:09.880]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[59:12.880 --> 59:17.880]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[59:17.880 --> 59:21.880]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[59:21.880 --> 59:24.880]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[59:24.880 --> 59:25.880]  Most people have no idea.
[59:25.880 --> 59:26.880]  They're not after money.
[59:26.880 --> 59:27.880]  They have all the money they need.
[59:27.880 --> 59:28.880]  They're after power.
[59:28.880 --> 59:29.880]  Yes, they're after easy.

[59:41.880 --> 59:43.880]  You have been warned.
[59:46.880 --> 59:48.880]  Waging war on corruption.
[59:48.880 --> 59:52.880]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[59:52.880 --> 59:54.880]  Government cover-ups.
[59:54.880 --> 59:55.880]  You want answers?
[59:55.880 --> 59:57.880]  Well, so does he.
[59:57.880 --> 1:00:01.880]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:01.880 --> 1:00:06.880]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:09.880 --> 1:00:11.880]  The new world order is succeeding
[1:00:11.880 --> 1:00:15.880]  because you can't face the full magnitude of their evil.
[1:00:15.880 --> 1:00:17.880]  You are so frightened.
[1:00:17.880 --> 1:00:22.880]  By the facts and the reality that you go back in your shell,
[1:00:22.880 --> 1:00:25.880]  you stick your head in the sand.
[1:00:25.880 --> 1:00:27.880]  Well, I want to know the truth, the whole truth,
[1:00:27.880 --> 1:00:28.880]  and about the truth,
[1:00:28.880 --> 1:00:30.880]  and I want to make preparations for it.
[1:00:30.880 --> 1:00:31.880]  And I'm doing that here.
[1:00:31.880 --> 1:00:33.880]  Going back to Zane.
[1:00:33.880 --> 1:00:35.880]  Yeah, they've got the military police out,
[1:00:35.880 --> 1:00:37.880]  you know, running the city there in Baghdad.
[1:00:37.880 --> 1:00:38.880]  That's well-documented.
[1:00:38.880 --> 1:00:40.880]  And so they pull you over for speeding
[1:00:40.880 --> 1:00:42.880]  and they run him back to the city.
[1:00:42.880 --> 1:00:44.880]  And so they pull you over for speeding
[1:00:44.880 --> 1:00:47.880]  and they run him back to the states.
[1:00:47.880 --> 1:00:48.880]  Absolutely, sir.
[1:00:48.880 --> 1:00:50.880]  It is a global grid.
[1:00:50.880 --> 1:00:51.880]  Go ahead.
[1:00:51.880 --> 1:00:55.880]  Yeah, I went with my buddy yesterday, this past weekend,
[1:00:55.880 --> 1:00:57.880]  to this Ron Paul rally.
[1:00:57.880 --> 1:01:00.880]  And from what I see of what's going on in the world,
[1:01:00.880 --> 1:01:03.880]  even though they had about 15,000 people there,
[1:01:03.880 --> 1:01:06.880]  which they say is a very big success,
[1:01:06.880 --> 1:01:07.880]  with everything going on,
[1:01:07.880 --> 1:01:10.880]  I was surprised to see not see a million people there.
[1:01:10.880 --> 1:01:13.880]  I just don't understand where everyone's thinking of logic
[1:01:13.880 --> 1:01:14.880]  anymore.
[1:01:14.880 --> 1:01:15.880]  It's so frustrating.
[1:01:15.880 --> 1:01:17.880]  You've got soldiers calling in left and right,
[1:01:17.880 --> 1:01:20.880]  Marines saying, we're calling in saying,
[1:01:20.880 --> 1:01:22.880]  man, we're in trouble.
[1:01:22.880 --> 1:01:25.880]  You know, and I don't understand what people are doing.
[1:01:25.880 --> 1:01:27.880]  They're just, they make inspirational videos.
[1:01:27.880 --> 1:01:29.880]  Hey, the time for making those are over.
[1:01:29.880 --> 1:01:31.880]  It's time to step up.
[1:01:31.880 --> 1:01:33.880]  I don't, I guess they just want to lay there and die.
[1:01:33.880 --> 1:01:36.880]  I don't understand it.
[1:01:36.880 --> 1:01:38.880]  Well, the enemy takes the flag
[1:01:38.880 --> 1:01:40.880]  and the images of our brave soldiers.
[1:01:40.880 --> 1:01:42.880]  And regardless of how you cut it,
[1:01:42.880 --> 1:01:44.880]  people are brave and have to be admired for that,
[1:01:44.880 --> 1:01:46.880]  even though they're misdirected and enslaved.
[1:01:46.880 --> 1:01:50.880]  And they, they put that image up and the people want to believe
[1:01:50.880 --> 1:01:51.880]  the lie.
[1:01:51.880 --> 1:01:53.880]  And that's why they're going to get hurt real, real bad.
[1:01:53.880 --> 1:01:57.880]  Because scientific eugenicists are in control.
[1:01:57.880 --> 1:02:00.880]  They are scientifically drugging and manipulating and brainwashing
[1:02:00.880 --> 1:02:03.880]  the public towards our orderly extermination.
[1:02:03.880 --> 1:02:06.880]  And that is the majority view in all the biology and psychology
[1:02:06.880 --> 1:02:10.880]  departments and engineering departments at every major university.
[1:02:10.880 --> 1:02:13.880]  I mean, I go back to Dr. Bianca and others.
[1:02:13.880 --> 1:02:15.880]  They give speeches saying kill 90% of us
[1:02:15.880 --> 1:02:19.880]  and they get 95% standing ovations sustained
[1:02:19.880 --> 1:02:23.880]  while they project giant power points of skulls
[1:02:23.880 --> 1:02:25.880]  with a red filter on it.
[1:02:25.880 --> 1:02:27.880]  And then Bianca starts saying,
[1:02:27.880 --> 1:02:29.880]  me and my family will die too.
[1:02:29.880 --> 1:02:31.880]  And they just start, you know, tears in their eyes,
[1:02:31.880 --> 1:02:34.880]  clapping, yes, we're going to die, die, you know,
[1:02:34.880 --> 1:02:35.880]  we're going to die.
[1:02:35.880 --> 1:02:37.880]  It is, it is the 13 monkeys.
[1:02:37.880 --> 1:02:39.880]  Police, you better go rent that movie
[1:02:39.880 --> 1:02:41.880]  and find out what they're telling you in that film.
[1:02:41.880 --> 1:02:43.880]  Okay, I'm telling you, get ready, get ready.
[1:02:43.880 --> 1:02:44.880]  Okay?
[1:02:44.880 --> 1:02:47.880]  I mean, you think this is about your personal power trip.
[1:02:47.880 --> 1:02:49.880]  You're going to find out this is so much darker
[1:02:49.880 --> 1:02:51.880]  and so much more evil.
[1:02:51.880 --> 1:02:53.880]  The intelligentsia is everywhere.
[1:02:53.880 --> 1:02:55.880]  This is their death cult religion.
[1:02:55.880 --> 1:02:58.880]  Hell itself is being, this is just the beginning.
[1:02:58.880 --> 1:03:00.880]  Hell is going to be released on the earth.
[1:03:00.880 --> 1:03:02.880]  And your preachers are going to tell you,
[1:03:02.880 --> 1:03:04.880]  praise God, it's Jesus.
[1:03:04.880 --> 1:03:06.880]  Anything else?
[1:03:06.880 --> 1:03:09.880]  I just, I'm really concerned about my country.
[1:03:09.880 --> 1:03:11.880]  I love it.
[1:03:11.880 --> 1:03:14.880]  And I hope that people will find the courage
[1:03:14.880 --> 1:03:16.880]  it takes to do what you do, do what soldiers do
[1:03:16.880 --> 1:03:18.880]  when they call in to tell you
[1:03:18.880 --> 1:03:20.880]  things are not going very good right now.
[1:03:20.880 --> 1:03:22.880]  And I hope they'll find their courage
[1:03:22.880 --> 1:03:25.880]  to do something about it.
[1:03:25.880 --> 1:03:28.880]  Well, that is a spooky door chime.
[1:03:28.880 --> 1:03:30.880]  Or is that a clock?
[1:03:30.880 --> 1:03:31.880]  That's a clock, sorry.
[1:03:31.880 --> 1:03:33.880]  Oh, what a beautiful sound.
[1:03:33.880 --> 1:03:35.880]  What a mysterious sound.
[1:03:35.880 --> 1:03:37.880]  I like that sound.
[1:03:37.880 --> 1:03:39.880]  That's why I don't want to get killed by the New World Order.
[1:03:39.880 --> 1:03:41.880]  I want to go on seeing seashores
[1:03:41.880 --> 1:03:43.880]  and the clouds and hearing clocks
[1:03:43.880 --> 1:03:45.880]  go off in the middle of the night.
[1:03:45.880 --> 1:03:47.880]  I just love life.
[1:03:47.880 --> 1:03:49.880]  All right, my friend, I appreciate you calling in.
[1:03:49.880 --> 1:03:51.880]  Good to hear from you.
[1:03:51.880 --> 1:03:53.880]  That's the thing, I just eat up life.
[1:03:53.880 --> 1:03:55.880]  I eat up experiences.
[1:03:55.880 --> 1:03:57.880]  And again, I'm talking about myself
[1:03:57.880 --> 1:03:59.880]  because this is what I'm personally experiencing.
[1:03:59.880 --> 1:04:01.880]  I know you're experiencing the same thing.
[1:04:01.880 --> 1:04:03.880]  And I want the police and the people
[1:04:03.880 --> 1:04:05.880]  working for the system to know this.
[1:04:05.880 --> 1:04:07.880]  I care about you.
[1:04:07.880 --> 1:04:09.880]  I'm very angry with you, but I'm angry with myself.
[1:04:09.880 --> 1:04:11.880]  Because I can't articulate properly
[1:04:11.880 --> 1:04:13.880]  what we're facing and what we're dealing with
[1:04:13.880 --> 1:04:15.880]  and how they manipulate us and how they control us
[1:04:15.880 --> 1:04:17.880]  and how they do it.
[1:04:17.880 --> 1:04:19.880]  I'm just so sad that
[1:04:19.880 --> 1:04:21.880]  you know, every time I research,
[1:04:21.880 --> 1:04:23.880]  every time I find out more,
[1:04:23.880 --> 1:04:25.880]  it's always worse than I even imagined.
[1:04:25.880 --> 1:04:27.880]  It's always,
[1:04:27.880 --> 1:04:29.880]  the pieces of it in front of me,
[1:04:29.880 --> 1:04:31.880]  it's so horrible.
[1:04:31.880 --> 1:04:33.880]  I can't even believe it, consciously.
[1:04:33.880 --> 1:04:35.880]  I intellectually know it's real,
[1:04:35.880 --> 1:04:37.880]  but in my gut I know it's real.
[1:04:37.880 --> 1:04:39.880]  It's still part of me just can't believe it
[1:04:39.880 --> 1:04:41.880]  and turns away from it.
[1:04:41.880 --> 1:04:43.880]  It's so horrible.
[1:04:43.880 --> 1:04:45.880]  So I understand why you're in denial.
[1:04:45.880 --> 1:04:47.880]  I understand.
[1:04:47.880 --> 1:04:49.880]  But we've got to get past that together.
[1:04:49.880 --> 1:04:51.880]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[1:04:51.880 --> 1:04:53.880]  I've come with a message of information.
[1:04:53.880 --> 1:04:55.880]  9-11 was an inside job.
[1:04:55.880 --> 1:04:57.880]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[1:04:57.880 --> 1:04:59.880]  Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[1:04:59.880 --> 1:05:01.880]  How do the American people know
[1:05:01.880 --> 1:05:03.880]  that 9-11 was a stage?
[1:05:03.880 --> 1:05:05.880]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller,
[1:05:05.880 --> 1:05:07.880]  the Thrallateral Commission, the CAF?
[1:05:07.880 --> 1:05:09.880]  The day that we stop asking questions
[1:05:09.880 --> 1:05:11.880]  is the day that we have allowed
[1:05:11.880 --> 1:05:13.880]  the seeds of despotism to grow
[1:05:13.880 --> 1:05:15.880]  at our own door.
[1:05:15.880 --> 1:05:17.880]  Seven years after the attacks
[1:05:17.880 --> 1:05:19.880]  of September 11,
[1:05:19.880 --> 1:05:21.880]  a global awakening has taken place.
[1:05:21.880 --> 1:05:23.880]  An inside job?
[1:05:23.880 --> 1:05:25.880]  How dare you?
[1:05:25.880 --> 1:05:27.880]  I always think about the comments
[1:05:27.880 --> 1:05:29.880]  just in the show in 9-11.
[1:05:29.880 --> 1:05:31.880]  If you know that there's treason going on,
[1:05:31.880 --> 1:05:33.880]  you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:05:33.880 --> 1:05:35.880]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:05:35.880 --> 1:05:37.880]  And if the government has not told the truth
[1:05:37.880 --> 1:05:39.880]  in five years, we will be here
[1:05:39.880 --> 1:05:59.880]  at 10th Anniversary of Life.
[1:06:13.880 --> 1:06:15.880]  We offer a real solution
[1:06:15.880 --> 1:06:17.880]  using real science.
[1:06:17.880 --> 1:06:19.880]  Our unique approach to cancer treatment
[1:06:19.880 --> 1:06:21.880]  is what everyone has been waiting for.
[1:06:21.880 --> 1:06:23.880]  A simple, easy way
[1:06:23.880 --> 1:06:25.880]  to eliminate the threat of cancer.
[1:06:25.880 --> 1:06:27.880]  Laser technology at its best.
[1:06:27.880 --> 1:06:29.880]  To receive an information packet,
[1:06:29.880 --> 1:06:31.880]  call our treatment center

[1:06:49.880 --> 1:06:51.880]  Have you ever suffered
[1:06:51.880 --> 1:06:53.880]  from giardia, food poisoning,
[1:06:53.880 --> 1:06:55.880]  heavy metal poisoning,
[1:06:55.880 --> 1:06:57.880]  arthritis, fatigue, or high cholesterol?
[1:06:57.880 --> 1:06:59.880]  Maybe you're one of the 75 million Americans
[1:06:59.880 --> 1:07:01.880]  at the Center for Disease Control reports
[1:07:01.880 --> 1:07:03.880]  of suffering from internal parasites.
[1:07:03.880 --> 1:07:05.880]  If so, freshwater organics
[1:07:05.880 --> 1:07:07.880]  are proud to introduce you
[1:07:07.880 --> 1:07:09.880]  to a million-year-old miracle
[1:07:09.880 --> 1:07:11.880]  that has been used all over the world
[1:07:11.880 --> 1:07:13.880]  by health-conscious individuals
[1:07:13.880 --> 1:07:15.880]  seeking alternatives to chemicals and drugs.
[1:07:15.880 --> 1:07:17.880]  FPP, or fossilized phytoplankin powder,
[1:07:17.880 --> 1:07:19.880]  is a 100% natural, organic product
[1:07:19.880 --> 1:07:21.880]  with absolutely no additives.

[1:07:23.880 --> 1:07:25.880]  of natural plant-based silica
[1:07:25.880 --> 1:07:27.880]  with 14 trace minerals.
[1:07:27.880 --> 1:07:29.880]  Many believe it is a key to a healthy
[1:07:29.880 --> 1:07:31.880]  digestive tract.
[1:07:31.880 --> 1:07:33.880]  To find an FPP distributor near you
[1:07:33.880 --> 1:07:39.880]  go to www.freshwaterorganics.com

[1:07:41.880 --> 1:07:45.880]  at 888-949-3570.
[1:07:45.880 --> 1:08:07.880]  You know, our ancestors made it through a lot of tough times,
[1:08:07.880 --> 1:08:09.880]  but it was always a physical adversity
[1:08:09.880 --> 1:08:11.880]  that they had to deal with,
[1:08:11.880 --> 1:08:13.880]  but obviously mentally is how they overcame it.
[1:08:13.880 --> 1:08:15.880]  It was 100 years ago
[1:08:15.880 --> 1:08:17.880]  to write best-selling books
[1:08:17.880 --> 1:08:19.880]  how they've been hired by the elite
[1:08:19.880 --> 1:08:21.880]  to create a scientific dictatorship
[1:08:21.880 --> 1:08:23.880]  that no one could escape.
[1:08:23.880 --> 1:08:25.880]  And they're nearing completing that
[1:08:25.880 --> 1:08:27.880]  and they say they're going to kill us
[1:08:27.880 --> 1:08:29.880]  and they're very pious.
[1:08:29.880 --> 1:08:31.880]  They think it's beautiful and wonderful
[1:08:31.880 --> 1:08:33.880]  what they're doing.
[1:08:33.880 --> 1:08:35.880]  They are focused. They work tirelessly.
[1:08:35.880 --> 1:08:37.880]  They are smarter than a lot of us,
[1:08:37.880 --> 1:08:39.880]  but they're also very twisted.
[1:08:39.880 --> 1:08:41.880]  But intellectually,
[1:08:41.880 --> 1:08:43.880]  you know, when it comes to math
[1:08:43.880 --> 1:08:45.880]  and algorithms and science,
[1:08:45.880 --> 1:08:47.880]  and I know we've got a lot of good people
[1:08:47.880 --> 1:08:49.880]  that are scientists too
[1:08:49.880 --> 1:08:51.880]  who have been able to understand what's happening,
[1:08:51.880 --> 1:08:53.880]  my God, we're just in a lot of trouble.
[1:08:53.880 --> 1:08:55.880]  I mean, I remember Poindexter
[1:08:55.880 --> 1:08:57.880]  the felon writing an editorial
[1:08:57.880 --> 1:08:59.880]  for the New York Times.
[1:08:59.880 --> 1:09:01.880]  You ought to pull it up.
[1:09:01.880 --> 1:09:03.880]  Just say Poindexter Total Information Awareness Network
[1:09:03.880 --> 1:09:05.880]  and then hit Web.
[1:09:05.880 --> 1:09:07.880]  Do a web search
[1:09:07.880 --> 1:09:09.880]  and it'll be the number one thing.
[1:09:09.880 --> 1:09:11.880]  Everything you do is tracked and, yeah,
[1:09:11.880 --> 1:09:13.880]  the police can dial in
[1:09:13.880 --> 1:09:15.880]  in departments where they pay for it
[1:09:15.880 --> 1:09:17.880]  instantly and get everything about Alex Jones.
[1:09:17.880 --> 1:09:19.880]  Forget just Googling somebody
[1:09:19.880 --> 1:09:21.880]  in their police car, which I watched
[1:09:21.880 --> 1:09:23.880]  Canadian police do two years ago.
[1:09:23.880 --> 1:09:25.880]  I remember
[1:09:25.880 --> 1:09:27.880]  the state police four years ago
[1:09:27.880 --> 1:09:29.880]  in Texas saying we want to,
[1:09:29.880 --> 1:09:31.880]  if you've ever said anything about police,
[1:09:31.880 --> 1:09:33.880]  we want to have that flag off of scanning cameras
[1:09:33.880 --> 1:09:35.880]  in our cars, you know,
[1:09:35.880 --> 1:09:37.880]  reading your plates, guilty and to prove innocent.
[1:09:37.880 --> 1:09:39.880]  I mean, this is hellish, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:09:39.880 --> 1:09:41.880]  And
[1:09:41.880 --> 1:09:43.880]  everything you do in your bank accounts
[1:09:43.880 --> 1:09:45.880]  is instantly uploaded to the feds.
[1:09:45.880 --> 1:09:47.880]  Every prescription you get is.
[1:09:47.880 --> 1:09:49.880]  And then they go out and they pay
[1:09:49.880 --> 1:09:51.880]  all the pizza places, all the major pizza chains
[1:09:51.880 --> 1:09:53.880]  instantly upload what you're getting,
[1:09:53.880 --> 1:09:55.880]  where you are, what your address is,
[1:09:55.880 --> 1:09:57.880]  just to check and see if you're wanted.
[1:09:57.880 --> 1:09:59.880]  Guilty and to prove innocent.
[1:09:59.880 --> 1:10:01.880]  I mean, this is criminal.
[1:10:01.880 --> 1:10:03.880]  And then they talk to you like your five-year-old children
[1:10:03.880 --> 1:10:05.880]  and say, oh, it's only
[1:10:05.880 --> 1:10:07.880]  for al-Qaeda.
[1:10:07.880 --> 1:10:09.880]  We're only seeing about if bin Laden
[1:10:09.880 --> 1:10:11.880]  is calling America.
[1:10:11.880 --> 1:10:13.880]  And they say there's no Fourth Amendment, but only for al-Qaeda.
[1:10:13.880 --> 1:10:15.880]  And they talk to you like your morons.
[1:10:17.880 --> 1:10:19.880]  It totally freaks me out to watch
[1:10:19.880 --> 1:10:21.880]  the United States fund al-Qaeda
[1:10:21.880 --> 1:10:23.880]  publicly against the Serbs and the Russians
[1:10:23.880 --> 1:10:25.880]  and then to be funding them
[1:10:25.880 --> 1:10:27.880]  now to attack Iran. Iran's
[1:10:27.880 --> 1:10:29.880]  videotaping, the mosque blown up,
[1:10:29.880 --> 1:10:31.880]  the power plants, the school buses,
[1:10:31.880 --> 1:10:33.880]  trying to get the Iranians to respond.
[1:10:33.880 --> 1:10:35.880]  Their people are rioting,
[1:10:35.880 --> 1:10:37.880]  demanding that
[1:10:37.880 --> 1:10:39.880]  their government fight back.
[1:10:39.880 --> 1:10:41.880]  Iran is suing the U.S. saying,
[1:10:41.880 --> 1:10:43.880]  please stop blowing up our churches.
[1:10:43.880 --> 1:10:45.880]  And the U.S. says, yeah, we're blowing them up,
[1:10:45.880 --> 1:10:47.880]  we're going to keep doing it. And then they laugh
[1:10:47.880 --> 1:10:49.880]  and say, because you're al-Qaeda,
[1:10:49.880 --> 1:10:51.880]  snickering as al-Qaeda does it.
[1:10:53.880 --> 1:10:55.880]  The White House puts out press releases
[1:10:55.880 --> 1:10:57.880]  that they're in control of al-Qaeda
[1:10:57.880 --> 1:10:59.880]  because they know you are ignorant.
[1:10:59.880 --> 1:11:01.880]  Bob Chapman
[1:11:01.880 --> 1:11:03.880]  worked in covert intelligence.
[1:11:03.880 --> 1:11:05.880]  We can't get into that. Then he had the
[1:11:05.880 --> 1:11:07.880]  largest gold and silver broker in the world.
[1:11:07.880 --> 1:11:09.880]  He had the largest newsletter
[1:11:09.880 --> 1:11:11.880]  in the world. He helped put out
[1:11:11.880 --> 1:11:13.880]  the newsletter that Gary Allen
[1:11:13.880 --> 1:11:15.880]  reported in the book, of course, an undare
[1:11:15.880 --> 1:11:17.880]  call of conspiracy. He is one of the four
[1:11:17.880 --> 1:11:19.880]  major icons, one of the three living
[1:11:19.880 --> 1:11:21.880]  out there who really
[1:11:21.880 --> 1:11:23.880]  got the ball rolling. He was, you know, even
[1:11:23.880 --> 1:11:25.880]  around before
[1:11:25.880 --> 1:11:27.880]  G. Edward Griffin. And
[1:11:27.880 --> 1:11:29.880]  he's 70 plus years of age.
[1:11:29.880 --> 1:11:31.880]  And he joins us
[1:11:31.880 --> 1:11:33.880]  now three days in a row. I want to hold
[1:11:33.880 --> 1:11:35.880]  him a little bit past the bottom of the hour, Bob,
[1:11:35.880 --> 1:11:37.880]  if you can, because I'm getting you on late.
[1:11:37.880 --> 1:11:39.880]  I want to run through all the huge developments
[1:11:39.880 --> 1:11:41.880]  since yesterday
[1:11:41.880 --> 1:11:43.880]  with more bank runs on the west coast,
[1:11:43.880 --> 1:11:45.880]  people freaking out. We're getting reports
[1:11:45.880 --> 1:11:47.880]  that hundreds of banks have people with lines
[1:11:47.880 --> 1:11:49.880]  out the door that are running out of cash.
[1:11:49.880 --> 1:11:51.880]  That's in the L.A.
[1:11:51.880 --> 1:11:53.880]  Times.
[1:11:53.880 --> 1:11:55.880]  We have all sorts of loans for
[1:11:55.880 --> 1:11:57.880]  condos, for paramount pitchers,
[1:11:57.880 --> 1:11:59.880]  for building
[1:11:59.880 --> 1:12:01.880]  some of the most expensive real estate in
[1:12:01.880 --> 1:12:03.880]  Austin's on Lake Austin in the Steiner
[1:12:03.880 --> 1:12:05.880]  Ranch. Scores of homes
[1:12:05.880 --> 1:12:07.880]  are going to be not be finished as things
[1:12:07.880 --> 1:12:09.880]  go into bankruptcy with builders.
[1:12:13.880 --> 1:12:15.880]  And he's got a Skype phone from the country
[1:12:15.880 --> 1:12:17.880]  he's calling us from. It just cut out. He'll call back.
[1:12:17.880 --> 1:12:19.880]  We'll continue to take calls. That's good
[1:12:19.880 --> 1:12:21.880]  because I can cover the financial news right
[1:12:21.880 --> 1:12:23.880]  now.
[1:12:23.880 --> 1:12:25.880]  First, all of this
[1:12:25.880 --> 1:12:27.880]  bedlam
[1:12:27.880 --> 1:12:29.880]  is taking place.
[1:12:29.880 --> 1:12:31.880]  We're going to get into that with Bob Chapman
[1:12:31.880 --> 1:12:33.880]  as soon as we're getting back on the line.
[1:12:33.880 --> 1:12:35.880]  He is not in the U.S., ladies and gentlemen.
[1:12:35.880 --> 1:12:37.880]  Everybody with a brain has left a long time ago,
[1:12:37.880 --> 1:12:39.880]  including Jesse Ventura.
[1:12:39.880 --> 1:12:41.880]  I was really pushing him and he just said,
[1:12:41.880 --> 1:12:43.880]  oh, you think I'm going to run? You think I will?
[1:12:43.880 --> 1:12:45.880]  He goes, I don't think the people want it.
[1:12:45.880 --> 1:12:47.880]  I don't think they saw it. There we started going
[1:12:47.880 --> 1:12:49.880]  during the breaks going. I don't think he's going to run.
[1:12:49.880 --> 1:12:51.880]  Then at the end, he said, well, Alex, I'll come on
[1:12:51.880 --> 1:12:53.880]  and then I came back and said, okay,
[1:12:53.880 --> 1:12:55.880]  I guess he isn't going to run.
[1:12:55.880 --> 1:12:57.880]  Big news, though.
[1:12:57.880 --> 1:12:59.880]  Jesse Ventura is respected by a lot of people.
[1:12:59.880 --> 1:13:01.880]  We need to force this into the mainstream media.
[1:13:01.880 --> 1:13:03.880]  Former Governor
[1:13:03.880 --> 1:13:05.880]  Absolute
[1:13:05.880 --> 1:13:07.880]  Governor Ventura, absolutely
[1:13:07.880 --> 1:13:09.880]  danger of false flag
[1:13:09.880 --> 1:13:11.880]  as pretext to attack Iran.
[1:13:11.880 --> 1:13:13.880]  That's the headline. Former
[1:13:13.880 --> 1:13:15.880]  Governor of Minnesota, Jesse Ventura, warns
[1:13:15.880 --> 1:13:17.880]  that neocons are so desperate to maintain a grip
[1:13:17.880 --> 1:13:19.880]  on power, but let's get it straight.
[1:13:19.880 --> 1:13:21.880]  They're going to pass their power on to the Democrats
[1:13:21.880 --> 1:13:23.880]  and other management team. There's going to be
[1:13:23.880 --> 1:13:25.880]  I mean, in this baton race,
[1:13:25.880 --> 1:13:27.880]  in this marathon, in this relay race,
[1:13:27.880 --> 1:13:29.880]  there will not even be
[1:13:29.880 --> 1:13:31.880]  a step missed, okay?
[1:13:31.880 --> 1:13:33.880]  Former Governor of Minnesota, Jesse Ventura,
[1:13:33.880 --> 1:13:35.880]  warns that neocons are so desperate
[1:13:35.880 --> 1:13:37.880]  to maintain a grip on power that they could stage a terror
[1:13:37.880 --> 1:13:39.880]  event in order to create a pretext for attacking Iran.
[1:13:39.880 --> 1:13:41.880]  Speaking on the Alex Jones radio show
[1:13:41.880 --> 1:13:43.880]  before last night's announcement
[1:13:43.880 --> 1:13:45.880]  that he would not be running for U.S. Senate.
[1:13:45.880 --> 1:13:47.880]  Ventura said a conflict with Iran was all but inevitable.
[1:13:47.880 --> 1:13:49.880]  I don't see any way
[1:13:49.880 --> 1:13:51.880]  of avoiding it because I think
[1:13:51.880 --> 1:13:53.880]  it's going to be Bush's last straw.
[1:13:53.880 --> 1:13:55.880]  Ventura adding that another war front
[1:13:55.880 --> 1:13:57.880]  would only help Republican
[1:13:59.880 --> 1:14:01.880]  candidates and John McCain
[1:14:01.880 --> 1:14:03.880]  went on. We are now
[1:14:03.880 --> 1:14:05.880]  a first strike nation
[1:14:05.880 --> 1:14:07.880]  9-11
[1:14:07.880 --> 1:14:09.880]  changed our entire
[1:14:09.880 --> 1:14:11.880]  foreign policy. We will now
[1:14:11.880 --> 1:14:13.880]  attack another country before they attack us,
[1:14:13.880 --> 1:14:15.880]  which we proved that Iraq he added
[1:14:15.880 --> 1:14:17.880]  asked if we were in danger of seeing
[1:14:17.880 --> 1:14:19.880]  the neocons stage some kind of Gulf of Tonkin
[1:14:19.880 --> 1:14:21.880]  false flag or other terror event as a pretext
[1:14:21.880 --> 1:14:23.880]  for attacking Iran, that's quote from me.
[1:14:23.880 --> 1:14:25.880]  Ventura responded absolutely
[1:14:25.880 --> 1:14:27.880]  read the last epilogue in my book
[1:14:27.880 --> 1:14:29.880]  I wrote that a year ago.
[1:14:31.880 --> 1:14:33.880]  Remember
[1:14:33.880 --> 1:14:35.880]  these two political parties are in
[1:14:35.880 --> 1:14:37.880]  a bad shape right now.
[1:14:37.880 --> 1:14:39.880]  McCain's trailing Republicans look like
[1:14:39.880 --> 1:14:41.880]  they'll be slaughtered in the congressional races
[1:14:41.880 --> 1:14:43.880]  and they're going to lose
[1:14:43.880 --> 1:14:45.880]  all their power.
[1:14:45.880 --> 1:14:47.880]  So rest assured that some type of decision
[1:14:47.880 --> 1:14:49.880]  they will have to come up
[1:14:49.880 --> 1:14:51.880]  with in an attempt to continue to keep
[1:14:51.880 --> 1:14:53.880]  themselves in power. That's their objective
[1:14:53.880 --> 1:14:55.880]  that's their objective stated
[1:14:55.880 --> 1:14:57.880]  Ventura.
[1:14:59.880 --> 1:15:01.880]  How much more stupid can we be
[1:15:01.880 --> 1:15:03.880]  if we buy into this
[1:15:03.880 --> 1:15:05.880]  concluded the governor.
[1:15:05.880 --> 1:15:07.880]  Ventura said that
[1:15:07.880 --> 1:15:09.880]  the war in Iraq is now taking its toll
[1:15:09.880 --> 1:15:11.880]  on the US economy that Americans
[1:15:11.880 --> 1:15:13.880]  need to feel the pain in order to understand
[1:15:13.880 --> 1:15:15.880]  that war is not profitable
[1:15:15.880 --> 1:15:17.880]  for the middle class and in fact
[1:15:17.880 --> 1:15:19.880]  has the opposite effect. I always
[1:15:19.880 --> 1:15:21.880]  believe what goes around comes around
[1:15:21.880 --> 1:15:23.880]  and we're going to get our comeuppance
[1:15:23.880 --> 1:15:25.880]  I think pretty quick here
[1:15:25.880 --> 1:15:27.880]  if we don't change the path around and start
[1:15:27.880 --> 1:15:29.880]  leading with diplomacy.
[1:15:29.880 --> 1:15:31.880]  Ventura said
[1:15:31.880 --> 1:15:33.880]  and so please
[1:15:33.880 --> 1:15:35.880]  this article is so important
[1:15:35.880 --> 1:15:37.880]  we need to add to this Paul wrote two stories
[1:15:37.880 --> 1:15:39.880]  days doing a great job. We need to add
[1:15:39.880 --> 1:15:41.880]  to this Ventura story Paul
[1:15:41.880 --> 1:15:43.880]  the former German defense minister
[1:15:43.880 --> 1:15:45.880]  the former Italian president
[1:15:45.880 --> 1:15:47.880]  Ray McGovern CIA section chief
[1:15:51.880 --> 1:15:53.880]  who also came out
[1:15:53.880 --> 1:15:55.880]  public Bill Christiansen saying total
[1:15:55.880 --> 1:15:57.880]  inside job
[1:15:57.880 --> 1:15:59.880]  all the other info so people when they read this
[1:15:59.880 --> 1:16:01.880]  realize it is thousands of prominent people
[1:16:01.880 --> 1:16:03.880]  not just best actress
[1:16:03.880 --> 1:16:05.880]  or Hollywood people or governors
[1:16:05.880 --> 1:16:07.880]  I mean we know you bastards
[1:16:07.880 --> 1:16:09.880]  we know you killed us we know you attacked us
[1:16:09.880 --> 1:16:11.880]  let's go to Bob Chapman
[1:16:11.880 --> 1:16:13.880]  Bob having some phone troubles there with you
[1:16:13.880 --> 1:16:15.880]  thanks for coming on with us to break down
[1:16:15.880 --> 1:16:17.880]  the huge developments that happened
[1:16:17.880 --> 1:16:19.880]  in the last 24 hours since you last joined us
[1:16:19.880 --> 1:16:21.880]  well first of all
[1:16:21.880 --> 1:16:23.880]  I've seen a lot of manipulations
[1:16:23.880 --> 1:16:25.880]  of the stock market since 1988
[1:16:25.880 --> 1:16:27.880]  but today was a classic
[1:16:27.880 --> 1:16:29.880]  the Dow was down 277
[1:16:29.880 --> 1:16:31.880]  points and
[1:16:31.880 --> 1:16:33.880]  these jerks started talking
[1:16:33.880 --> 1:16:35.880]  which are Bernanke
[1:16:35.880 --> 1:16:37.880]  Paulson
[1:16:37.880 --> 1:16:39.880]  and Cox who's the head of the SEC
[1:16:39.880 --> 1:16:41.880]  and
[1:16:41.880 --> 1:16:43.880]  they took the market back up to plus territory
[1:16:43.880 --> 1:16:45.880]  and
[1:16:45.880 --> 1:16:47.880]  they took oil down
[1:16:47.880 --> 1:16:49.880]  eight bucks and
[1:16:49.880 --> 1:16:51.880]  this was the work of Goldman Sachs
[1:16:51.880 --> 1:16:53.880]  because they were long oil bull time
[1:16:53.880 --> 1:16:55.880]  big time and people told me
[1:16:55.880 --> 1:16:57.880]  that they were the sellers in the pits
[1:16:57.880 --> 1:16:59.880]  and the gold
[1:16:59.880 --> 1:17:01.880]  early this morning at 3.30
[1:17:01.880 --> 1:17:03.880]  was up $12.30
[1:17:03.880 --> 1:17:05.880]  and
[1:17:05.880 --> 1:17:07.880]  and silver was up
[1:17:07.880 --> 1:17:09.880]  21 cents
[1:17:09.880 --> 1:17:11.880]  and they knocked it all the way back down again
[1:17:11.880 --> 1:17:13.880]  they have it off right now
[1:17:13.880 --> 1:17:15.880]  but I think it's going to close up for the day
[1:17:15.880 --> 1:17:17.880]  but the point is this
[1:17:17.880 --> 1:17:19.880]  this is classic
[1:17:19.880 --> 1:17:21.880]  criminality and they're all
[1:17:21.880 --> 1:17:23.880]  in on it
[1:17:25.880 --> 1:17:27.880]  to explain to people
[1:17:27.880 --> 1:17:29.880]  we are going to have to pay
[1:17:29.880 --> 1:17:31.880]  not only in tax money for all the money
[1:17:31.880 --> 1:17:33.880]  they injected the tens of billions in the stock market
[1:17:33.880 --> 1:17:35.880]  we are also going to have to pay the interest
[1:17:35.880 --> 1:17:37.880]  on that for everybody out there
[1:17:37.880 --> 1:17:39.880]  and we're going to have to play for the losses
[1:17:39.880 --> 1:17:41.880]  now they got the gold up to
[1:17:41.880 --> 1:17:43.880]  10 silver's up
[1:17:43.880 --> 1:17:45.880]  22 cents but the point is
[1:17:45.880 --> 1:17:47.880]  they lose money more often
[1:17:47.880 --> 1:17:49.880]  than not when they do this
[1:17:49.880 --> 1:17:51.880]  no matter what market it's in
[1:17:51.880 --> 1:17:53.880]  and
[1:17:53.880 --> 1:17:55.880]  we just get to pay for it
[1:17:55.880 --> 1:17:57.880]  it's incredible what's going on
[1:17:57.880 --> 1:17:59.880]  these people should be taken up
[1:17:59.880 --> 1:18:01.880]  and tried
[1:18:01.880 --> 1:18:03.880]  and they should be convicted
[1:18:03.880 --> 1:18:05.880]  and all of their assets should be taken away from them
[1:18:05.880 --> 1:18:07.880]  and
[1:18:07.880 --> 1:18:09.880]  they should be put on probation
[1:18:09.880 --> 1:18:11.880]  for the rest of their life
[1:18:11.880 --> 1:18:13.880]  having to report once a month
[1:18:13.880 --> 1:18:15.880]  for all of the evil deeds that they've
[1:18:15.880 --> 1:18:17.880]  done and all of their assets
[1:18:17.880 --> 1:18:19.880]  should be given to the government
[1:18:19.880 --> 1:18:21.880]  which is the people from whom they
[1:18:21.880 --> 1:18:23.880]  stole from
[1:18:23.880 --> 1:18:25.880]  now bob are you still
[1:18:25.880 --> 1:18:27.880]  saying it's going to take two and a half years
[1:18:27.880 --> 1:18:29.880]  under the total depression
[1:18:29.880 --> 1:18:31.880]  yes i think so
[1:18:31.880 --> 1:18:33.880]  because even though
[1:18:33.880 --> 1:18:35.880]  the stock market will go down
[1:18:35.880 --> 1:18:37.880]  it's still going to be an evolutionary
[1:18:37.880 --> 1:18:39.880]  process
[1:18:39.880 --> 1:18:41.880]  and you see right now
[1:18:41.880 --> 1:18:43.880]  half the financial institutions
[1:18:43.880 --> 1:18:45.880]  in the united states of bankrupt
[1:18:45.880 --> 1:18:47.880]  we see indy mac here
[1:18:47.880 --> 1:18:49.880]  and country wide there
[1:18:49.880 --> 1:18:51.880]  and there will be about 300 of them
[1:18:51.880 --> 1:18:53.880]  over the next year
[1:18:53.880 --> 1:18:55.880]  it's time for it to happen
[1:18:55.880 --> 1:18:57.880]  absolutely so it's just
[1:18:57.880 --> 1:18:59.880]  i mean falling this far it takes a while to get there
[1:18:59.880 --> 1:19:01.880]  it does
[1:19:01.880 --> 1:19:03.880]  and you know they have the ability to run it back
[1:19:03.880 --> 1:19:05.880]  up again and we're going to knock it back down again
[1:19:05.880 --> 1:19:07.880]  or they knock it down again
[1:19:07.880 --> 1:19:09.880]  and we run it back up again depending upon what you're looking at
[1:19:09.880 --> 1:19:11.880]  but you know i'm looking at christopher cox
[1:19:11.880 --> 1:19:13.880]  here the guy is a criminal
[1:19:13.880 --> 1:19:15.880]  he's allowing
[1:19:15.880 --> 1:19:17.880]  to make it shorting to be going on what does that mean
[1:19:17.880 --> 1:19:19.880]  it means that you can sell a stock
[1:19:19.880 --> 1:19:21.880]  without borrowing it
[1:19:21.880 --> 1:19:23.880]  to make a market
[1:19:23.880 --> 1:19:25.880]  go down
[1:19:25.880 --> 1:19:27.880]  and they've known that the big brokerage houses
[1:19:27.880 --> 1:19:29.880]  have been doing this for many many years
[1:19:29.880 --> 1:19:31.880]  i started
[1:19:31.880 --> 1:19:33.880]  attacking the sec on it in 1980
[1:19:33.880 --> 1:19:35.880]  and you can understand
[1:19:35.880 --> 1:19:37.880]  why they hate me
[1:19:37.880 --> 1:19:39.880]  bob chappan stay there we'll be back after the break
[1:19:39.880 --> 1:19:41.880]  to go over what's happening
[1:19:41.880 --> 1:19:43.880]  as the stock market
[1:19:43.880 --> 1:19:45.880]  plunges as banks fail
[1:19:45.880 --> 1:19:47.880]  as all sorts of badlums sets in

[1:22:45.880 --> 1:22:49.880]  the voice of the second American Revolution
[1:22:49.880 --> 1:22:51.880]  have you ever felt like the United States government
[1:22:51.880 --> 1:22:53.880]  knows way too much about your financial affairs
[1:22:53.880 --> 1:22:55.880]  I continue to hear stories about property
[1:22:55.880 --> 1:22:57.880]  seizures frozen bank accounts
[1:22:57.880 --> 1:22:59.880]  confiscation of stocks and bonds
[1:22:59.880 --> 1:23:01.880]  it makes me wonder if the US citizen
[1:23:01.880 --> 1:23:03.880]  will ever again have the right to life
[1:23:03.880 --> 1:23:05.880]  liberty and the pursuit of happiness

[1:23:53.880 --> 1:23:55.880]  the dollar plunged further
[1:23:55.880 --> 1:23:57.880]  to all time record lows today
[1:23:57.880 --> 1:23:59.880]  gold exploded upward along with
[1:23:59.880 --> 1:24:01.880]  silver
[1:24:04.880 --> 1:24:06.880]  they're now admitting that wholesale inflation
[1:24:06.880 --> 1:24:08.880]  is the worst in 27 years
[1:24:08.880 --> 1:24:10.880]  that's with whitewash numbers
[1:24:10.880 --> 1:24:12.880]  Los Angeles Times
[1:24:12.880 --> 1:24:14.880]  banks hit by fallout from the crisis in Indie Mac
[1:24:14.880 --> 1:24:16.880]  they're not only lined up in Indie Mac
[1:24:16.880 --> 1:24:18.880]  they're now lining up outside other banks
[1:24:18.880 --> 1:24:20.880]  how long can they keep giving them the cash
[1:24:20.880 --> 1:24:22.880]  especially on the west coast
[1:24:22.880 --> 1:24:24.880]  Bob
[1:24:24.880 --> 1:24:26.880]  we are sitting on top of Powder Keg
[1:24:26.880 --> 1:24:28.880]  in layman's terms explain what happens
[1:24:28.880 --> 1:24:30.880]  since you were with us yesterday afternoon
[1:24:30.880 --> 1:24:32.880]  through today
[1:24:32.880 --> 1:24:34.880]  well they're making an effort
[1:24:34.880 --> 1:24:36.880]  to hold Franny May
[1:24:36.880 --> 1:24:38.880]  and Franny Mac together
[1:24:38.880 --> 1:24:40.880]  in spite of that
[1:24:40.880 --> 1:24:42.880]  both stocks are down again
[1:24:42.880 --> 1:24:44.880]  incidentally for those of you
[1:24:44.880 --> 1:24:46.880]  who want to know about the international forecaster
[1:24:46.880 --> 1:24:48.880]  we went short
[1:24:48.880 --> 1:24:50.880]  that means you're betting that a stock's going to go down
[1:24:50.880 --> 1:24:52.880]  Franny May at about $60
[1:24:52.880 --> 1:24:54.880]  I just seen a pass at 8.5 here
[1:24:54.880 --> 1:24:56.880]  so the people who went short at 60
[1:24:56.880 --> 1:24:58.880]  are making buku money at 8.5
[1:24:58.880 --> 1:25:00.880]  and I think
[1:25:00.880 --> 1:25:02.880]  eventually what's going to happen
[1:25:02.880 --> 1:25:04.880]  they got it down to $8 now
[1:25:04.880 --> 1:25:06.880]  what's going to happen is that
[1:25:06.880 --> 1:25:08.880]  they're going to be absorbed by the United States government
[1:25:08.880 --> 1:25:10.880]  and all those shareholders
[1:25:10.880 --> 1:25:12.880]  will lose their position
[1:25:12.880 --> 1:25:14.880]  in the company as will the bondholders
[1:25:14.880 --> 1:25:16.880]  one of the reasons
[1:25:16.880 --> 1:25:18.880]  that they're so frantic
[1:25:18.880 --> 1:25:20.880]  to bail out Franny and Freddie
[1:25:20.880 --> 1:25:22.880]  is the Chinese are holding
[1:25:22.880 --> 1:25:24.880]  I think it's $376 billion
[1:25:24.880 --> 1:25:26.880]  worth of that paper
[1:25:26.880 --> 1:25:28.880]  and bonds if you may
[1:25:28.880 --> 1:25:30.880]  and
[1:25:30.880 --> 1:25:32.880]  I would think that they'd be very disturbed
[1:25:32.880 --> 1:25:34.880]  Franny and Freddie went under
[1:25:34.880 --> 1:25:36.880]  but I don't see any other way around it
[1:25:36.880 --> 1:25:38.880]  and they can't
[1:25:38.880 --> 1:25:40.880]  pay the bondholders out
[1:25:40.880 --> 1:25:42.880]  because they're talking over a trillion dollars
[1:25:42.880 --> 1:25:44.880]  they just don't have the money to do it
[1:25:44.880 --> 1:25:46.880]  and so
[1:25:46.880 --> 1:25:48.880]  they're at a tight spot and what they're talking about
[1:25:48.880 --> 1:25:50.880]  what they're doing
[1:25:50.880 --> 1:25:52.880]  is not going to work
[1:25:52.880 --> 1:25:54.880]  they're both bankrupt
[1:25:54.880 --> 1:25:56.880]  they've been bankrupt for about 3.5 to 4 years
[1:25:56.880 --> 1:25:58.880]  and
[1:25:58.880 --> 1:26:00.880]  all they're doing is
[1:26:00.880 --> 1:26:02.880]  getting the problem out into the future
[1:26:02.880 --> 1:26:04.880]  so that
[1:26:04.880 --> 1:26:06.880]  they can gain more time to whatever they're going to do
[1:26:06.880 --> 1:26:08.880]  hide their assets
[1:26:08.880 --> 1:26:10.880]  stay in office
[1:26:10.880 --> 1:26:12.880]  and all those things that are hooked up
[1:26:12.880 --> 1:26:14.880]  with people like Paulson
[1:26:14.880 --> 1:26:16.880]  and Bernanke
[1:26:16.880 --> 1:26:18.880]  and Cox and Rotten Congress
[1:26:18.880 --> 1:26:20.880]  and
[1:26:20.880 --> 1:26:22.880]  there is no answer for that
[1:26:22.880 --> 1:26:24.880]  also what they did today
[1:26:24.880 --> 1:26:26.880]  is they took down oil more than $8
[1:26:26.880 --> 1:26:28.880]  and that was
[1:26:28.880 --> 1:26:30.880]  Goldman Sachs selling into the market
[1:26:30.880 --> 1:26:32.880]  this stuff doesn't happen by chance
[1:26:32.880 --> 1:26:34.880]  this is coordinated
[1:26:34.880 --> 1:26:36.880]  by our government
[1:26:36.880 --> 1:26:38.880]  they are the ones who are doing this
[1:26:38.880 --> 1:26:40.880]  now with the case of gold
[1:26:40.880 --> 1:26:42.880]  they drove it down $12
[1:26:42.880 --> 1:26:44.880]  then he drove it down
[1:26:44.880 --> 1:26:46.880]  3 or 4 more dollars
[1:26:46.880 --> 1:26:48.880]  and now it's up $5
[1:26:48.880 --> 1:26:50.880]  they can't keep it down
[1:26:50.880 --> 1:26:52.880]  why is that?
[1:26:52.880 --> 1:26:54.880]  because in times of trouble
[1:26:54.880 --> 1:26:56.880]  the only real money is gold
[1:26:56.880 --> 1:26:58.880]  and silver
[1:26:58.880 --> 1:27:00.880]  particularly in a hyperinflationary environment
[1:27:00.880 --> 1:27:02.880]  like we have today
[1:27:02.880 --> 1:27:04.880]  all of you people
[1:27:04.880 --> 1:27:06.880]  who are in banks
[1:27:06.880 --> 1:27:08.880]  and have money sitting there
[1:27:08.880 --> 1:27:10.880]  at these very small interest rates
[1:27:10.880 --> 1:27:12.880]  you want to go out and buy
[1:27:12.880 --> 1:27:14.880]  gold and silver related assets
[1:27:14.880 --> 1:27:16.880]  and if you don't want all your money in there
[1:27:16.880 --> 1:27:18.880]  by Swiss rank
[1:27:18.880 --> 1:27:20.880]  government bonds you're a heck of a lot safer
[1:27:20.880 --> 1:27:22.880]  than you are sitting
[1:27:22.880 --> 1:27:24.880]  in a savings account with a bank
[1:27:24.880 --> 1:27:26.880]  or another kind of financial institution
[1:27:28.880 --> 1:27:30.880]  I just wanted you to elaborate Bob
[1:27:30.880 --> 1:27:32.880]  on the fact that in the past
[1:27:32.880 --> 1:27:34.880]  the Federal Reserve could keep oil down
[1:27:34.880 --> 1:27:36.880]  they could keep gold down
[1:27:36.880 --> 1:27:38.880]  now they're failing
[1:27:38.880 --> 1:27:40.880]  and that's the scariest thing of all
[1:27:40.880 --> 1:27:42.880]  is that they wanted their cake
[1:27:42.880 --> 1:27:44.880]  and ate it too they wanted to pay off all these debts
[1:27:44.880 --> 1:27:46.880]  with fiat currency
[1:27:46.880 --> 1:27:48.880]  but now everybody's running from the dollar
[1:27:48.880 --> 1:27:50.880]  and they're unable
[1:27:50.880 --> 1:27:52.880]  to control the slide
[1:27:52.880 --> 1:27:54.880]  or they want to implode the middle class
[1:27:54.880 --> 1:27:56.880]  they just wanted to be more orderly
[1:27:56.880 --> 1:27:58.880]  this is not orderly
[1:27:58.880 --> 1:28:00.880]  and they know that then it could be blamed on them
[1:28:00.880 --> 1:28:02.880]  who deserve
[1:28:02.880 --> 1:28:04.880]  who actually did it
[1:28:04.880 --> 1:28:06.880]  well you know Alex yesterday
[1:28:06.880 --> 1:28:08.880]  you said
[1:28:08.880 --> 1:28:10.880]  that the people behind the scenes
[1:28:10.880 --> 1:28:12.880]  the Illuminati, the elitists
[1:28:12.880 --> 1:28:14.880]  didn't expect
[1:28:14.880 --> 1:28:16.880]  that this
[1:28:16.880 --> 1:28:18.880]  downturn was going to be as vicious
[1:28:18.880 --> 1:28:20.880]  as it is
[1:28:20.880 --> 1:28:22.880]  to understand to lose everything
[1:28:22.880 --> 1:28:24.880]  and that's what they're terrified about
[1:28:26.880 --> 1:28:28.880]  this thing is out of hand
[1:28:28.880 --> 1:28:30.880]  out of their hands
[1:28:30.880 --> 1:28:32.880]  they are terrified
[1:28:32.880 --> 1:28:34.880]  and your program and programs like it
[1:28:34.880 --> 1:28:36.880]  and my publications and other publications like it
[1:28:36.880 --> 1:28:38.880]  are driving them up a tree
[1:28:38.880 --> 1:28:40.880]  they don't know what to do
[1:28:40.880 --> 1:28:42.880]  and we have got them on the run
[1:28:42.880 --> 1:28:44.880]  and we've got to capitalize on this
[1:28:46.880 --> 1:28:48.880]  all of you people out there
[1:28:48.880 --> 1:28:50.880]  all of your friends this is what's really going on
[1:28:50.880 --> 1:28:52.880]  and it's live
[1:28:52.880 --> 1:28:54.880]  you can turn on CNBC
[1:28:54.880 --> 1:28:56.880]  and watch
[1:28:56.880 --> 1:28:58.880]  what's going on
[1:28:58.880 --> 1:29:00.880]  do you agree with what I keep saying
[1:29:00.880 --> 1:29:02.880]  that we have got to expose
[1:29:02.880 --> 1:29:04.880]  that they are behind all of this
[1:29:04.880 --> 1:29:06.880]  or they'll be able to pose as the saviors
[1:29:06.880 --> 1:29:08.880]  yet again but if we
[1:29:08.880 --> 1:29:10.880]  blame it on who actually did it
[1:29:10.880 --> 1:29:12.880]  we can use this against them and this could bring them down
[1:29:12.880 --> 1:29:14.880]  you're absolutely right Alex
[1:29:14.880 --> 1:29:16.880]  in spades
[1:29:16.880 --> 1:29:18.880]  this is the chance of a lifetime
[1:29:18.880 --> 1:29:20.880]  for people
[1:29:20.880 --> 1:29:22.880]  who want to bring down the Illuminati
[1:29:22.880 --> 1:29:24.880]  the people who have been
[1:29:24.880 --> 1:29:26.880]  destroying civilization for a thousand years
[1:29:26.880 --> 1:29:28.880]  stay there Bob Chapman when we come back

[1:32:26.880 --> 1:32:28.880]  he takes his hand off and you hear it 3, 2, 1

[1:32:52.880 --> 1:32:54.880]  Big John
[1:32:56.880 --> 1:32:58.880]  every morning at the mine
[1:32:58.880 --> 1:33:00.880]  you could see him arrive
[1:33:00.880 --> 1:33:02.880]  he stood six foot six and waited 245
[1:33:02.880 --> 1:33:04.880]  at the shoulder
[1:33:04.880 --> 1:33:06.880]  and there at the hip
[1:33:06.880 --> 1:33:08.880]  and everybody knew you didn't give no left to Big John
[1:33:10.880 --> 1:33:12.880]  Big John
[1:33:12.880 --> 1:33:14.880]  Big John
[1:33:14.880 --> 1:33:16.880]  Big Bad John
[1:33:18.880 --> 1:33:20.880]  Big John
[1:33:20.880 --> 1:33:22.880]  nobody seemed to know
[1:33:22.880 --> 1:33:24.880]  where John called home
[1:33:24.880 --> 1:33:26.880]  he just drifted into town and stayed all alone
[1:33:26.880 --> 1:33:28.880]  didn't say much
[1:33:28.880 --> 1:33:30.880]  kind of quiet and shy
[1:33:30.880 --> 1:33:32.880]  he spoke it all
[1:33:32.880 --> 1:33:34.880]  and he just said hi to Big John
[1:33:36.880 --> 1:33:38.880]  somebody said he came from New Orleans
[1:33:38.880 --> 1:33:40.880]  where he got in a fight
[1:33:40.880 --> 1:33:42.880]  or a Cajun Queen
[1:33:42.880 --> 1:33:44.880]  and I crashed and blowed from a huge right hand
[1:33:44.880 --> 1:33:46.880]  sent a Louisiana fellow
[1:33:46.880 --> 1:33:48.880]  to the promised land
[1:33:48.880 --> 1:33:50.880]  Big John
[1:33:50.880 --> 1:33:52.880]  Big John
[1:33:52.880 --> 1:33:54.880]  Big John
[1:33:54.880 --> 1:33:56.880]  Big Bad John
[1:33:56.880 --> 1:33:58.880]  Big John
[1:34:00.880 --> 1:34:02.880]  then came the day at the bottom of the mine
[1:34:02.880 --> 1:34:04.880]  when a timber cracked
[1:34:04.880 --> 1:34:06.880]  and men started crying
[1:34:06.880 --> 1:34:08.880]  miners were praying and hearts beat fast
[1:34:08.880 --> 1:34:10.880]  everybody thought it did breathe
[1:34:10.880 --> 1:34:12.880]  the last step John
[1:34:14.880 --> 1:34:16.880]  through the dust and the smoke
[1:34:16.880 --> 1:34:18.880]  this man made hell off the giant of a man
[1:34:18.880 --> 1:34:20.880]  the miners knew well
[1:34:20.880 --> 1:34:22.880]  grabbed a sagging timber, gave out with a groan
[1:34:22.880 --> 1:34:24.880]  and like a giant old tree
[1:34:24.880 --> 1:34:26.880]  Big John
[1:34:26.880 --> 1:34:28.880]  we're back live Bob Chapman
[1:34:28.880 --> 1:34:30.880]  only got him about 10 more minutes
[1:34:30.880 --> 1:34:32.880]  I want to give him to pop in with us each day this week
[1:34:32.880 --> 1:34:34.880]  we also got Dr. Paul Craig Roberts lined up
[1:34:34.880 --> 1:34:36.880]  Richard C. Cook
[1:34:36.880 --> 1:34:38.880]  we're going to get Joseph Sticklet
[1:34:38.880 --> 1:34:40.880]  Nobel Prize winner on as well
[1:34:44.880 --> 1:34:46.880]  Bob Chapman
[1:34:46.880 --> 1:34:48.880]  in the 10 minutes or so we've got left with you
[1:34:48.880 --> 1:34:50.880]  here my friend
[1:34:50.880 --> 1:34:52.880]  they are now putting out reports
[1:34:52.880 --> 1:34:54.880]  in ABC news saying
[1:34:54.880 --> 1:34:56.880]  what banks are safe
[1:34:56.880 --> 1:34:58.880]  headline whose next list of troubled banks
[1:34:58.880 --> 1:35:00.880]  worries Wall Street
[1:35:00.880 --> 1:35:02.880]  I'm going to read this later in the next hour
[1:35:02.880 --> 1:35:04.880]  when we're taking calls folks I want to go through some details
[1:35:04.880 --> 1:35:06.880]  for you
[1:35:06.880 --> 1:35:08.880]  but if you
[1:35:08.880 --> 1:35:10.880]  don't
[1:35:10.880 --> 1:35:12.880]  if you don't research this just leave your money
[1:35:12.880 --> 1:35:14.880]  in a bank you're crazy
[1:35:14.880 --> 1:35:16.880]  I mean I would suggest diversifying
[1:35:16.880 --> 1:35:18.880]  and Bob's right
[1:35:18.880 --> 1:35:20.880]  real estate's going down even though we have inflation
[1:35:20.880 --> 1:35:22.880]  meanwhile
[1:35:22.880 --> 1:35:24.880]  every type of investment is
[1:35:24.880 --> 1:35:26.880]  going down or unsafe
[1:35:26.880 --> 1:35:28.880]  precious metals are the place to be but
[1:35:28.880 --> 1:35:30.880]  you say 300
[1:35:30.880 --> 1:35:32.880]  banks will fail those are good size banks
[1:35:32.880 --> 1:35:34.880]  give us your
[1:35:34.880 --> 1:35:36.880]  forecast then conservatively
[1:35:36.880 --> 1:35:38.880]  how do you see this unfolding in the next
[1:35:38.880 --> 1:35:40.880]  weeks to come
[1:35:40.880 --> 1:35:42.880]  well the 300 figure is from the United States
[1:35:42.880 --> 1:35:44.880]  government and I have to agree with it
[1:35:44.880 --> 1:35:46.880]  so it's official
[1:35:46.880 --> 1:35:48.880]  so it's probably very
[1:35:48.880 --> 1:35:50.880]  conservative
[1:35:50.880 --> 1:35:52.880]  and you know this fanny freddy bailout
[1:35:52.880 --> 1:35:54.880]  was in the works weeks ago
[1:35:54.880 --> 1:35:56.880]  they've been working on this thing
[1:35:56.880 --> 1:35:58.880]  they know what they were facing
[1:35:58.880 --> 1:36:00.880]  and again on the
[1:36:00.880 --> 1:36:02.880]  on these banks people
[1:36:02.880 --> 1:36:04.880]  should have faiths in their homes
[1:36:04.880 --> 1:36:06.880]  they should have 5
[1:36:06.880 --> 1:36:08.880]  or 10 thousand dollars in small bills
[1:36:08.880 --> 1:36:10.880]  for emergencies
[1:36:10.880 --> 1:36:12.880]  and money they could lie in on the banks
[1:36:12.880 --> 1:36:14.880]  I told you what to do with it
[1:36:14.880 --> 1:36:16.880]  and incidentally people who
[1:36:16.880 --> 1:36:18.880]  check on their bank
[1:36:18.880 --> 1:36:20.880]  we have a service we can email
[1:36:20.880 --> 1:36:22.880]  to you if you want that
[1:36:22.880 --> 1:36:24.880]  and we're happy to do it for you
[1:36:24.880 --> 1:36:26.880]  and we'll send you a free copy of the
[1:36:26.880 --> 1:36:28.880]  international forecaster as well
[1:36:28.880 --> 1:36:30.880]  all you have to do is email
[1:36:30.880 --> 1:36:32.880]  international underscore
[1:36:32.880 --> 1:36:34.880]  forecaster at yahoo.com
[1:36:34.880 --> 1:36:36.880]  international
[1:36:36.880 --> 1:36:38.880]  underscore f o r e
[1:36:38.880 --> 1:36:40.880]  c a s t e r
[1:36:40.880 --> 1:36:42.880]  at y a h o o dot com
[1:36:42.880 --> 1:36:44.880]  and you'll be able to
[1:36:44.880 --> 1:36:46.880]  charge a small fee
[1:36:46.880 --> 1:36:48.880]  you'll be able to find out the bank
[1:36:48.880 --> 1:36:50.880]  that you're at what the reading is
[1:36:50.880 --> 1:36:52.880]  well the only reason I know about
[1:36:52.880 --> 1:36:54.880]  Wacovia is we had a family member
[1:36:54.880 --> 1:36:56.880]  give a couple thousand dollars years ago
[1:36:56.880 --> 1:36:58.880]  when my daughter was born my first daughter
[1:36:58.880 --> 1:37:00.880]  and so we have that little account sitting there
[1:37:00.880 --> 1:37:02.880]  and it was world savings
[1:37:02.880 --> 1:37:04.880]  then Wacovia got it
[1:37:04.880 --> 1:37:06.880]  then washington mutual got it
[1:37:06.880 --> 1:37:08.880]  and we got a report
[1:37:08.880 --> 1:37:10.880]  you know six months ago that washington mutual
[1:37:10.880 --> 1:37:12.880]  had bought it out when it was troubled
[1:37:12.880 --> 1:37:14.880]  we were hearing Wacovia may be going under
[1:37:14.880 --> 1:37:16.880]  and then I'm trying to research this morning
[1:37:16.880 --> 1:37:18.880]  there's only a couple thousand in there
[1:37:18.880 --> 1:37:20.880]  but you know as a savings account
[1:37:20.880 --> 1:37:22.880]  but the point is
[1:37:22.880 --> 1:37:24.880]  they're telling us Wacovia does that really mean
[1:37:24.880 --> 1:37:26.880]  Washington mutual just as one little example
[1:37:26.880 --> 1:37:28.880]  yes
[1:37:28.880 --> 1:37:30.880]  and you know if that money's in it
[1:37:30.880 --> 1:37:32.880]  get it out and buy some gold coins with it
[1:37:32.880 --> 1:37:34.880]  I mean why would anybody
[1:37:34.880 --> 1:37:36.880]  keep money in the bank for the
[1:37:36.880 --> 1:37:38.880]  crummy two percent that they're paying you
[1:37:38.880 --> 1:37:40.880]  well I agree Bob I just don't
[1:37:40.880 --> 1:37:42.880]  most of us are so busy fighting the new order
[1:37:42.880 --> 1:37:44.880]  now that you've got to get on your horse
[1:37:44.880 --> 1:37:46.880]  I'm too busy trying to warn people
[1:37:46.880 --> 1:37:48.880]  they make money and they work hard at it
[1:37:48.880 --> 1:37:50.880]  and they learn their profession
[1:37:50.880 --> 1:37:52.880]  and then they turn
[1:37:52.880 --> 1:37:54.880]  the money over to someone else who loses it
[1:37:54.880 --> 1:37:56.880]  and you can't let that happen
[1:37:56.880 --> 1:37:58.880]  I know
[1:37:58.880 --> 1:38:00.880]  I know but I'm just like my dad
[1:38:00.880 --> 1:38:02.880]  I don't buy things
[1:38:02.880 --> 1:38:04.880]  I don't like buying things things are always annoying to me
[1:38:04.880 --> 1:38:06.880]  and I've got to do the same thing
[1:38:06.880 --> 1:38:08.880]  I know
[1:38:08.880 --> 1:38:10.880]  you know you just wish you could put your money in a bank
[1:38:10.880 --> 1:38:12.880]  but yeah there's a savings account
[1:38:12.880 --> 1:38:14.880]  for college but I guess you just can't do that
[1:38:14.880 --> 1:38:16.880]  now at least
[1:38:16.880 --> 1:38:18.880]  not at this point in time there may come a time
[1:38:18.880 --> 1:38:20.880]  that you will be able to do that
[1:38:20.880 --> 1:38:22.880]  but if you buy
[1:38:22.880 --> 1:38:24.880]  gold coins and gold goes to three thousand
[1:38:24.880 --> 1:38:26.880]  you'll triple your money
[1:38:26.880 --> 1:38:28.880]  and then if the bank is
[1:38:28.880 --> 1:38:30.880]  then again solvent then you can put
[1:38:30.880 --> 1:38:32.880]  your money back in there again well sure Bob
[1:38:32.880 --> 1:38:34.880]  I mean I bought gold and silver I bought silver one
[1:38:34.880 --> 1:38:36.880]  was six seven bucks I bought gold
[1:38:36.880 --> 1:38:38.880]  and it was two hundred and eighty bucks
[1:38:38.880 --> 1:38:40.880]  and now it's you know
[1:38:40.880 --> 1:38:42.880]  nine hundred and seventy something
[1:38:42.880 --> 1:38:44.880]  and it's been over a thousand so certainly I know that
[1:38:44.880 --> 1:38:46.880]  I just even the money
[1:38:46.880 --> 1:38:48.880]  I have in the business to pay for the
[1:38:48.880 --> 1:38:50.880]  servers and pay the employees
[1:38:50.880 --> 1:38:52.880]  and keep operating I start worrying about
[1:38:52.880 --> 1:38:54.880]  that little bit of seed money we have to
[1:38:54.880 --> 1:38:56.880]  try to start the TV show I mean it's just all going
[1:38:56.880 --> 1:38:58.880]  to hell in a handbasket
[1:38:58.880 --> 1:39:00.880]  and now that we're seeing confidence
[1:39:00.880 --> 1:39:02.880]  to be lost I just don't know
[1:39:02.880 --> 1:39:04.880]  why you and Dr. Roberts and everybody else
[1:39:04.880 --> 1:39:06.880]  have three years but you guys are the experts
[1:39:06.880 --> 1:39:08.880]  and you know you're the one that said
[1:39:08.880 --> 1:39:10.880]  short the market and you were right again
[1:39:10.880 --> 1:39:12.880]  you're almost always right Bob so thank God
[1:39:12.880 --> 1:39:14.880]  you're I hope you're right and we got
[1:39:14.880 --> 1:39:16.880]  two and a half years but but but in that
[1:39:16.880 --> 1:39:18.880]  gradual two and a half years kind of in
[1:39:18.880 --> 1:39:20.880]  the last three or four minutes we've got run through
[1:39:20.880 --> 1:39:22.880]  what it'll look like
[1:39:26.880 --> 1:39:28.880]  a degenerative process is what it is
[1:39:28.880 --> 1:39:30.880]  it'll just get steadily worse
[1:39:30.880 --> 1:39:32.880]  you'll see the Dow Jones
[1:39:32.880 --> 1:39:34.880]  industrial average
[1:39:34.880 --> 1:39:36.880]  dropped to 10,200
[1:39:36.880 --> 1:39:38.880]  9300
[1:39:38.880 --> 1:39:40.880]  8800
[1:39:40.880 --> 1:39:42.880]  7268
[1:39:42.880 --> 1:39:44.880]  and then the final break will come
[1:39:44.880 --> 1:39:46.880]  when it drops down to 4,000
[1:39:46.880 --> 1:39:48.880]  it is going to happen but that's down the line
[1:39:48.880 --> 1:39:50.880]  everything just doesn't happen overnight
[1:39:50.880 --> 1:39:52.880]  this is not 1929
[1:39:52.880 --> 1:39:54.880]  we've got government in there
[1:39:54.880 --> 1:39:56.880]  corporate fascism
[1:39:56.880 --> 1:39:58.880]  and then massaging the whole thing
[1:39:58.880 --> 1:40:00.880]  they're trying to bring it down quote
[1:40:00.880 --> 1:40:02.880]  they think as a soft landing
[1:40:02.880 --> 1:40:04.880]  forget it
[1:40:04.880 --> 1:40:06.880]  it isn't going to happen but when is it going to break
[1:40:06.880 --> 1:40:08.880]  I don't know
[1:40:08.880 --> 1:40:10.880]  and Paul Craig Roberts doesn't know
[1:40:10.880 --> 1:40:12.880]  all we know is that it is
[1:40:12.880 --> 1:40:14.880]  and there's no way to fix it
[1:40:18.880 --> 1:40:20.880]  so you said Sunday on the Sunday
[1:40:20.880 --> 1:40:22.880]  show that a depression is assured
[1:40:22.880 --> 1:40:24.880]  what type of depression is
[1:40:24.880 --> 1:40:26.880]  assured when it arrives
[1:40:26.880 --> 1:40:28.880]  hyperinflationary and we will reach
[1:40:28.880 --> 1:40:30.880]  a point where that hyperinflation
[1:40:30.880 --> 1:40:32.880]  will end
[1:40:32.880 --> 1:40:34.880]  and everything will plunge
[1:40:34.880 --> 1:40:36.880]  and that's when you have the losses of
[1:40:36.880 --> 1:40:38.880]  60, 70, 80, 90%
[1:40:38.880 --> 1:40:40.880]  on the assets that you have
[1:40:40.880 --> 1:40:42.880]  and the only thing that's going to hold is value
[1:40:42.880 --> 1:40:44.880]  because hyperinflation
[1:40:44.880 --> 1:40:46.880]  is good for gold and silver
[1:40:46.880 --> 1:40:48.880]  but deflation
[1:40:48.880 --> 1:40:50.880]  is not good for silver
[1:40:50.880 --> 1:40:52.880]  and so you would be a seller of silver
[1:40:52.880 --> 1:40:54.880]  at the top of the market
[1:40:54.880 --> 1:40:56.880]  but you would remain in bullion coin
[1:40:56.880 --> 1:40:58.880]  as the final
[1:40:58.880 --> 1:41:00.880]  safety asset
[1:41:00.880 --> 1:41:02.880]  and let's say
[1:41:02.880 --> 1:41:04.880]  gold was $6,000 an ounce
[1:41:04.880 --> 1:41:06.880]  and maybe gold would fall to 4,000
[1:41:06.880 --> 1:41:08.880]  who cares
[1:41:08.880 --> 1:41:10.880]  it beats having
[1:41:10.880 --> 1:41:12.880]  a commercial building
[1:41:12.880 --> 1:41:14.880]  that just dropped from 10 million
[1:41:14.880 --> 1:41:16.880]  to 3 million
[1:41:16.880 --> 1:41:18.880]  it beats having a house that just went from
[1:41:18.880 --> 1:41:20.880]  500,000 to 150
[1:41:20.880 --> 1:41:22.880]  and on and on and on
[1:41:22.880 --> 1:41:24.880]  it's the gold
[1:41:24.880 --> 1:41:26.880]  is the only safe place
[1:41:26.880 --> 1:41:28.880]  in the world to be
[1:41:28.880 --> 1:41:30.880]  Bob, when is the start of what you'd call
[1:41:30.880 --> 1:41:32.880]  with current trends
[1:41:32.880 --> 1:41:34.880]  projecting, connecting the lines
[1:41:34.880 --> 1:41:36.880]  out there on the horizon
[1:41:36.880 --> 1:41:38.880]  when will you herald
[1:41:38.880 --> 1:41:40.880]  what will the climate be like
[1:41:40.880 --> 1:41:42.880]  financially when we are in the depression
[1:41:42.880 --> 1:41:44.880]  and then how long will it run
[1:41:44.880 --> 1:41:46.880]  until you have the total implosion
[1:41:48.880 --> 1:41:50.880]  Well, total implosion
[1:41:50.880 --> 1:41:52.880]  could take 5 to 10 years
[1:41:52.880 --> 1:41:54.880]  maybe 15 or 20
[1:41:54.880 --> 1:41:56.880]  I mean, this is not a normal
[1:41:56.880 --> 1:41:58.880]  depression that we're going to have
[1:41:58.880 --> 1:42:00.880]  it's not like the 1930s, it's far worse
[1:42:00.880 --> 1:42:02.880]  and so, you know, it'll last
[1:42:02.880 --> 1:42:04.880]  a long time
[1:42:04.880 --> 1:42:06.880]  and it's going to be worldwide
[1:42:06.880 --> 1:42:08.880]  all those people out there in Europe and South America
[1:42:08.880 --> 1:42:10.880]  or wherever who think they're going to escape this
[1:42:10.880 --> 1:42:12.880]  they're crazy
[1:42:12.880 --> 1:42:14.880]  Yeah, I see a lot of
[1:42:14.880 --> 1:42:16.880]  the PM in Ireland came out
[1:42:16.880 --> 1:42:18.880]  two days ago and said, oh, things are going to get down
[1:42:18.880 --> 1:42:20.880]  but we're going to be alright
[1:42:20.880 --> 1:42:22.880]  Well, I've seen a lot of foreigners laughing at us
[1:42:22.880 --> 1:42:24.880]  going, ha, ha, look at you warmongers
[1:42:24.880 --> 1:42:26.880]  now, don't they understand
[1:42:26.880 --> 1:42:28.880]  this is a black hole that's going to suck them down to
[1:42:28.880 --> 1:42:30.880]  No, they don't
[1:42:30.880 --> 1:42:32.880]  and it's always the mighty of the
[1:42:32.880 --> 1:42:34.880]  Vowel syndrome
[1:42:34.880 --> 1:42:36.880]  it as much as they are
[1:42:36.880 --> 1:42:38.880]  right
[1:42:38.880 --> 1:42:40.880]  they're correct
[1:42:40.880 --> 1:42:42.880]  but the only thing is that
[1:42:42.880 --> 1:42:44.880]  they don't really understand how bad it's going to get
[1:42:44.880 --> 1:42:46.880]  so we'll be
[1:42:46.880 --> 1:42:48.880]  when the market breaks
[1:42:48.880 --> 1:42:50.880]  in hyperinflation
[1:42:50.880 --> 1:42:52.880]  it'll be identified
[1:42:52.880 --> 1:42:54.880]  by
[1:42:54.880 --> 1:42:56.880]  plenty of liquidity but
[1:42:56.880 --> 1:42:58.880]  nobody willing to borrow
[1:42:58.880 --> 1:43:00.880]  and when that happens it's the beginning
[1:43:00.880 --> 1:43:02.880]  of the end
[1:43:02.880 --> 1:43:04.880]  and that is the signpost that you look for
[1:43:04.880 --> 1:43:06.880]  and Paul Craig
[1:43:06.880 --> 1:43:08.880]  Robbis would tell you the same thing
[1:43:08.880 --> 1:43:10.880]  we went to the same
[1:43:10.880 --> 1:43:12.880]  general school of knowledge
[1:43:12.880 --> 1:43:14.880]  and we saw it differently
[1:43:14.880 --> 1:43:16.880]  than the mainstream
[1:43:16.880 --> 1:43:18.880]  economists and why did we
[1:43:18.880 --> 1:43:20.880]  because we're different kind of people
[1:43:20.880 --> 1:43:22.880]  and we don't believe the crap that they told us
[1:43:22.880 --> 1:43:24.880]  in college, in fact
[1:43:24.880 --> 1:43:26.880]  Mr. Robbis taught in college
[1:43:26.880 --> 1:43:28.880]  which I didn't
[1:43:28.880 --> 1:43:30.880]  I had two uncles that did but I didn't
[1:43:30.880 --> 1:43:32.880]  and they
[1:43:32.880 --> 1:43:34.880]  people just
[1:43:34.880 --> 1:43:36.880]  in the economics profession
[1:43:36.880 --> 1:43:38.880]  can't say
[1:43:38.880 --> 1:43:40.880]  the truth because they lose their jobs
[1:43:40.880 --> 1:43:42.880]  who do they work for
[1:43:42.880 --> 1:43:44.880]  a university
[1:43:44.880 --> 1:43:46.880]  international corporation
[1:43:46.880 --> 1:43:48.880]  a wall street firm
[1:43:48.880 --> 1:43:50.880]  or a bank or the united states government
[1:43:50.880 --> 1:43:52.880]  do you think for one second
[1:43:52.880 --> 1:43:54.880]  they're going to come out and say well all this is going to happen
[1:43:54.880 --> 1:43:56.880]  they'll lose their job
[1:43:56.880 --> 1:43:58.880]  and that's why economists are wrong
[1:43:58.880 --> 1:44:00.880]  two thirds of the time
[1:44:00.880 --> 1:44:02.880]  now Bob
[1:44:02.880 --> 1:44:04.880]  in closing here
[1:44:04.880 --> 1:44:06.880]  if we were to raise tariffs
[1:44:06.880 --> 1:44:08.880]  raise interest rates
[1:44:08.880 --> 1:44:10.880]  announce
[1:44:10.880 --> 1:44:12.880]  that we were going to be a strong nation again
[1:44:12.880 --> 1:44:14.880]  and pay our debts
[1:44:14.880 --> 1:44:16.880]  you and others have said
[1:44:16.880 --> 1:44:18.880]  that would just cause us to have a hard landing
[1:44:18.880 --> 1:44:20.880]  instead of a prolonged
[1:44:20.880 --> 1:44:22.880]  total wreck
[1:44:22.880 --> 1:44:24.880]  destroying the financial future
[1:44:24.880 --> 1:44:26.880]  and killing the golden goose
[1:44:26.880 --> 1:44:28.880]  obviously the elites are not planning
[1:44:28.880 --> 1:44:30.880]  to try to reverse things
[1:44:30.880 --> 1:44:32.880]  but what would things look like
[1:44:32.880 --> 1:44:34.880]  in the softer crash landing
[1:44:34.880 --> 1:44:36.880]  versus the meat grinder
[1:44:38.880 --> 1:44:40.880]  well there is no softer
[1:44:40.880 --> 1:44:42.880]  if we did it right now
[1:44:42.880 --> 1:44:44.880]  the way we're supposed to be doing it
[1:44:44.880 --> 1:44:46.880]  it would be nasty
[1:44:46.880 --> 1:44:48.880]  but what we got down the road
[1:44:48.880 --> 1:44:50.880]  the meat grinder you talk about
[1:44:50.880 --> 1:44:52.880]  is three times nastier
[1:44:52.880 --> 1:44:54.880]  so if they bit the bulletin here
[1:44:54.880 --> 1:44:56.880]  and did what they're supposed to do
[1:44:56.880 --> 1:44:58.880]  it would be quick and bloody
[1:44:58.880 --> 1:45:00.880]  from a financial and economic viewpoint
[1:45:00.880 --> 1:45:02.880]  but they don't want that
[1:45:02.880 --> 1:45:04.880]  they think maybe
[1:45:04.880 --> 1:45:06.880]  they might be able to survive the system
[1:45:06.880 --> 1:45:08.880]  maybe they could worm their way out of it
[1:45:08.880 --> 1:45:10.880]  like they have everything else
[1:45:10.880 --> 1:45:12.880]  but they are being disturbed
[1:45:12.880 --> 1:45:14.880]  because when you see all those people
[1:45:14.880 --> 1:45:16.880]  on television today at the senate
[1:45:16.880 --> 1:45:18.880]  finance committee
[1:45:18.880 --> 1:45:20.880]  and you see fanny and freddy plunging
[1:45:20.880 --> 1:45:22.880]  you know that the market
[1:45:22.880 --> 1:45:24.880]  the street is telling you
[1:45:24.880 --> 1:45:26.880]  we don't care what those guys say
[1:45:26.880 --> 1:45:28.880]  we know fanny and freddy
[1:45:28.880 --> 1:45:30.880]  are going down the government is going to take them over
[1:45:30.880 --> 1:45:32.880]  they have the banks
[1:45:32.880 --> 1:45:34.880]  and the country are going down
[1:45:34.880 --> 1:45:36.880]  that's what the market is telling you
[1:45:36.880 --> 1:45:38.880]  the news says their current obligations
[1:45:38.880 --> 1:45:40.880]  and debts is 55.5
[1:45:40.880 --> 1:45:42.880]  trillion
[1:45:42.880 --> 1:45:44.880]  but then we know they're leveraged
[1:45:44.880 --> 1:45:46.880]  but that's secret
[1:45:46.880 --> 1:45:48.880]  what are their real exposures with all the crap
[1:45:48.880 --> 1:45:50.880]  they've triple A rated and all the
[1:45:50.880 --> 1:45:52.880]  side scams and money laundering
[1:45:52.880 --> 1:45:54.880]  and drug dealing
[1:45:54.880 --> 1:45:56.880]  it just came out that city banks
[1:45:56.880 --> 1:45:58.880]  got all these secret assets that looks like
[1:45:58.880 --> 1:46:00.880]  drugs
[1:46:00.880 --> 1:46:02.880]  brilliant dollars
[1:46:02.880 --> 1:46:04.880]  and they've all got them
[1:46:04.880 --> 1:46:06.880]  the whole
[1:46:06.880 --> 1:46:08.880]  the accounting system
[1:46:08.880 --> 1:46:10.880]  doesn't work because they won't allow it to
[1:46:10.880 --> 1:46:12.880]  so that's what I'm saying
[1:46:12.880 --> 1:46:14.880]  they've got all this other crap someplace else
[1:46:14.880 --> 1:46:16.880]  so that's what I'm saying
[1:46:16.880 --> 1:46:18.880]  they are criminals but that's what I'm saying
[1:46:18.880 --> 1:46:20.880]  bob
[1:46:20.880 --> 1:46:22.880]  do you have any gauge on
[1:46:22.880 --> 1:46:24.880]  the chain reaction that freddy
[1:46:24.880 --> 1:46:26.880]  and fanny are going to cause
[1:46:26.880 --> 1:46:28.880]  they're saying it's 55 trillion
[1:46:28.880 --> 1:46:30.880]  what is it really
[1:46:30.880 --> 1:46:32.880]  well I think they could easily
[1:46:32.880 --> 1:46:34.880]  lose 5 to 10 trillion dollars
[1:46:34.880 --> 1:46:36.880]  and that would mean the American
[1:46:36.880 --> 1:46:38.880]  taxpayer would pay that
[1:46:38.880 --> 1:46:40.880]  but it would mean the whole system's coming down
[1:46:40.880 --> 1:46:42.880]  and it will come down
[1:46:42.880 --> 1:46:44.880]  it's just a question of how long
[1:46:44.880 --> 1:46:46.880]  and I don't know what those numbers are
[1:46:46.880 --> 1:46:48.880]  because they won't tell anybody
[1:46:48.880 --> 1:46:50.880]  either that they were counting on fanny and fanny
[1:46:50.880 --> 1:46:52.880]  freddy is a year and a half behind
[1:46:52.880 --> 1:46:54.880]  they haven't
[1:46:54.880 --> 1:46:56.880]  issued financial statements for a long time
[1:46:56.880 --> 1:46:58.880]  and can you imagine
[1:46:58.880 --> 1:47:00.880]  now this is where the FCC comes in
[1:47:00.880 --> 1:47:02.880]  if you imagine
[1:47:02.880 --> 1:47:04.880]  institutions and moneymen
[1:47:04.880 --> 1:47:06.880]  is recommending
[1:47:06.880 --> 1:47:08.880]  those stocks at $50
[1:47:08.880 --> 1:47:10.880]  and $60 without a financial statement
[1:47:10.880 --> 1:47:12.880]  come on give me a break
[1:47:12.880 --> 1:47:14.880]  I've been doing this for 50 years
[1:47:14.880 --> 1:47:16.880]  they should all be in jail
[1:47:16.880 --> 1:47:18.880]  that's right they can't even
[1:47:18.880 --> 1:47:20.880]  dummy up a fake statement now
[1:47:20.880 --> 1:47:22.880]  that just means that
[1:47:22.880 --> 1:47:24.880]  well all the elites I know
[1:47:24.880 --> 1:47:26.880]  moved out years ago they fled the country
[1:47:26.880 --> 1:47:28.880]  and their words are this country
[1:47:28.880 --> 1:47:30.880]  quote won't be here and I say
[1:47:30.880 --> 1:47:32.880]  what does that mean and they say you'll see
[1:47:32.880 --> 1:47:34.880]  what does that mean Bob
[1:47:34.880 --> 1:47:36.880]  it means in its current economic
[1:47:36.880 --> 1:47:38.880]  and financial form
[1:47:38.880 --> 1:47:40.880]  it won't be there but I'll go one step further
[1:47:40.880 --> 1:47:42.880]  neither will any other country
[1:47:42.880 --> 1:47:44.880]  in the world because we're all going to get zapped
[1:47:46.880 --> 1:47:48.880]  bastards now they think they're going to be able
[1:47:48.880 --> 1:47:50.880]  to hide with their money they're sadly mistaken
[1:47:50.880 --> 1:47:52.880]  because we're going to root them out
[1:47:52.880 --> 1:47:54.880]  and try them
[1:47:54.880 --> 1:47:56.880]  and some of them are going to get hung
[1:47:56.880 --> 1:47:58.880]  and I hope they're listening to the program
[1:47:58.880 --> 1:48:00.880]  because we intend to do that
[1:48:00.880 --> 1:48:02.880]  to them and they're not going to get away with it
[1:48:02.880 --> 1:48:04.880]  well I tell you you look at Bernanke
[1:48:04.880 --> 1:48:06.880]  and the rest of those criminals they look scared
[1:48:06.880 --> 1:48:08.880]  when they're up there and you're right in the past
[1:48:08.880 --> 1:48:10.880]  they would come out with some bull
[1:48:10.880 --> 1:48:12.880]  and the markets would shoot up now they come out
[1:48:12.880 --> 1:48:14.880]  with bull the markets plunge
[1:48:14.880 --> 1:48:16.880]  I mean oh man Bob this doesn't look good
[1:48:16.880 --> 1:48:18.880]  it isn't good
[1:48:18.880 --> 1:48:20.880]  and you know we've told you all out there
[1:48:20.880 --> 1:48:22.880]  what to do do it
[1:48:22.880 --> 1:48:24.880]  please do it
[1:48:24.880 --> 1:48:26.880]  for the sake of your country
[1:48:26.880 --> 1:48:28.880]  for the survival of your family
[1:48:28.880 --> 1:48:30.880]  and everybody within the United States of America
[1:48:30.880 --> 1:48:32.880]  because when we can survive
[1:48:32.880 --> 1:48:34.880]  maybe we can help the rest of the world survive
[1:48:34.880 --> 1:48:36.880]  yeah that's the key because when the world
[1:48:36.880 --> 1:48:38.880]  figures out we're going into a depression
[1:48:38.880 --> 1:48:40.880]  which could happen anytime or two years
[1:48:40.880 --> 1:48:42.880]  three years from now as the experts keep saying
[1:48:42.880 --> 1:48:44.880]  when they figure it out they're going to grab up
[1:48:44.880 --> 1:48:46.880]  the proven reserves of gold
[1:48:46.880 --> 1:48:48.880]  and we've got what
[1:48:48.880 --> 1:48:50.880]  two three percent of the world population in gold
[1:48:50.880 --> 1:48:52.880]  if five percent get in from the numbers
[1:48:52.880 --> 1:48:54.880]  I've seen it'll dry up supplies
[1:48:54.880 --> 1:48:56.880]  and that's what will drive it to
[1:48:56.880 --> 1:48:58.880]  5,000 as Bloomberg saying
[1:48:58.880 --> 1:49:00.880]  is that an accurate statement Bob Chapman
[1:49:00.880 --> 1:49:02.880]  it is an accurate statement
[1:49:02.880 --> 1:49:04.880]  I mean UBS came out yesterday and said
[1:49:04.880 --> 1:49:06.880]  well it's not going to go to 850 next month
[1:49:06.880 --> 1:49:08.880]  it's going to go to 1,000
[1:49:08.880 --> 1:49:10.880]  well you know turn on the light UBS
[1:49:10.880 --> 1:49:12.880]  I mean where were you
[1:49:12.880 --> 1:49:14.880]  when gold was 252
[1:49:14.880 --> 1:49:16.880]  we had people buying
[1:49:16.880 --> 1:49:18.880]  numismatic coins
[1:49:18.880 --> 1:49:20.880]  US 20s
[1:49:20.880 --> 1:49:22.880]  for $275
[1:49:22.880 --> 1:49:24.880]  an hour about 1,300
[1:49:24.880 --> 1:49:26.880]  we had them buying Agnico Eagle at 4 bucks
[1:49:26.880 --> 1:49:28.880]  it just traded at
[1:49:28.880 --> 1:49:30.880]  83 and a half
[1:49:30.880 --> 1:49:32.880]  come on guys where have you been
[1:49:32.880 --> 1:49:34.880]  it's insane Bob how accurate your newsletter is
[1:49:34.880 --> 1:49:36.880]  theinternationalforecaster.com
[1:49:36.880 --> 1:49:38.880]  Bob we'll talk to you again tomorrow
[1:49:38.880 --> 1:49:40.880]  in fact let me have
[1:49:40.880 --> 1:49:42.880]  if you would call Trey
[1:49:42.880 --> 1:49:44.880]  so that he can set you up for
[1:49:44.880 --> 1:49:46.880]  maybe the third or fourth hour whatever time you'd like

[1:49:56.880 --> 1:49:58.880]  ok bye
[1:49:58.880 --> 1:50:00.880]  oh man folks you know you'd think I'd be happy
[1:50:00.880 --> 1:50:02.880]  that I told you to invest in gold
[1:50:02.880 --> 1:50:04.880]  when it was 260 something bucks an ounce
[1:50:04.880 --> 1:50:06.880]  and it's at 1,000 right now basically
[1:50:06.880 --> 1:50:08.880]  I'm not happy
[1:50:08.880 --> 1:50:10.880]  I just I can't believe it
[1:50:10.880 --> 1:50:12.880]  I look at my children and I get mad
[1:50:12.880 --> 1:50:14.880]  I looked at my children this morning
[1:50:14.880 --> 1:50:16.880]  and I literally got angry
[1:50:16.880 --> 1:50:18.880]  I don't deserve this
[1:50:18.880 --> 1:50:20.880]  what the dirt bags of this country have done
[1:50:22.880 --> 1:50:24.880]  all you
[1:50:24.880 --> 1:50:26.880]  slack-jawed know-it-all
[1:50:26.880 --> 1:50:28.880]  yuppies that thought it was cute and thought corruption
[1:50:28.880 --> 1:50:30.880]  was cute
[1:50:30.880 --> 1:50:32.880]  and thought all this police state was cute
[1:50:32.880 --> 1:50:34.880]  you have let us be completely looted
[1:50:34.880 --> 1:50:36.880]  by a pack of criminals
[1:50:36.880 --> 1:50:38.880]  but while they were robbing us
[1:50:38.880 --> 1:50:40.880]  they left the stove on and now they're burning down the house
[1:50:42.880 --> 1:50:44.880]  and of course those jackasses have now found out
[1:50:44.880 --> 1:50:46.880]  this is locked they can't get out either
[1:50:46.880 --> 1:50:48.880]  and

[1:55:04.880 --> 1:55:06.880]  I've got some of those
[1:55:06.880 --> 1:55:08.880]  and
[1:55:08.880 --> 1:55:10.880]  you are completely out of your minds

[1:55:30.880 --> 1:55:32.880]  because I thought it would take another month for it to happen
[1:55:32.880 --> 1:55:34.880]  but it's not it's happening right now

[1:56:06.880 --> 1:56:08.880]  above spot
[1:56:08.880 --> 1:56:10.880]  we try to keep it real close to
[1:56:10.880 --> 1:56:12.880]  spot because people need to get into the price
[1:56:12.880 --> 1:56:14.880]  but I mean Ted no you can't get silver dollars
[1:56:14.880 --> 1:56:16.880]  anywhere for that I know
[1:56:16.880 --> 1:56:18.880]  the silver dollars at first of all there's
[1:56:18.880 --> 1:56:20.880]  they were unavailable completely just three months
[1:56:20.880 --> 1:56:22.880]  ago right now they're so okay

[1:56:30.880 --> 1:56:32.880]  same special as yesterday
[1:56:32.880 --> 1:56:34.880]  and yes indeed it was when gold was at
[1:56:34.880 --> 1:56:36.880]  960 when I locked the stuff
[1:56:36.880 --> 1:56:38.880]  in now we're looking at 990
[1:56:38.880 --> 1:56:40.880]  instead silver
[1:56:40.880 --> 1:56:42.880]  was down at $17
[1:56:42.880 --> 1:56:44.880]  and 50 cents and now it's
[1:56:44.880 --> 1:56:46.880]  at $19 and 50 cents
[1:56:46.880 --> 1:56:48.880]  and anybody
[1:56:48.880 --> 1:56:50.880]  especially anybody that's listening to this show here today
[1:56:50.880 --> 1:56:52.880]  should know I mean
[1:56:52.880 --> 1:56:54.880]  come on I mean they're having a run on
[1:56:54.880 --> 1:56:56.880]  the banks it's going all the way into
[1:56:56.880 --> 1:56:58.880]  Australia because our California banks
[1:56:58.880 --> 1:57:00.880]  are having problems this the whole
[1:57:00.880 --> 1:57:02.880]  market's coming unglued right now oh god
[1:57:02.880 --> 1:57:04.880]  you know I don't want to argue
[1:57:04.880 --> 1:57:06.880]  with Chapman and Roberts and sticklets and
[1:57:06.880 --> 1:57:08.880]  all these experts because they're almost always
[1:57:08.880 --> 1:57:10.880]  right but my gut tells me
[1:57:10.880 --> 1:57:12.880]  but
[1:57:12.880 --> 1:57:14.880]  I'm probably wrong they're saying we still got
[1:57:14.880 --> 1:57:16.880]  two and a half years till till
[1:57:16.880 --> 1:57:18.880]  Road Warrior and I don't see
[1:57:18.880 --> 1:57:20.880]  that tip. Well you know I don't know
[1:57:20.880 --> 1:57:22.880]  and Road Warrior is a good example of that
[1:57:22.880 --> 1:57:24.880]  where you have complete anarchy but
[1:57:24.880 --> 1:57:26.880]  it's happening right now
[1:57:26.880 --> 1:57:28.880]  I was surprised that we're hitting close to
[1:57:28.880 --> 1:57:30.880]  $1,000 dollars before August
[1:57:30.880 --> 1:57:32.880]  I mean really quite frankly I had
[1:57:32.880 --> 1:57:34.880]  no expectation of any bank
[1:57:34.880 --> 1:57:36.880]  failing in the month of July
[1:57:36.880 --> 1:57:38.880]  I thought yeah we're going to have this happen
[1:57:38.880 --> 1:57:40.880]  always happens in October. Yeah exactly
[1:57:40.880 --> 1:57:42.880]  obviously the
[1:57:42.880 --> 1:57:44.880]  controlling arms that be out there
[1:57:44.880 --> 1:57:46.880]  they've lost control they can't keep it running
[1:57:46.880 --> 1:57:48.880]  and you also got to think about the fact
[1:57:48.880 --> 1:57:50.880]  when they're bailing out these banks
[1:57:50.880 --> 1:57:52.880]  Fannie Mac and Freddie Mac and all these different
[1:57:52.880 --> 1:57:54.880]  things they're out there printing money to do it
[1:57:54.880 --> 1:57:56.880]  Bob is saying the tax payer is going to cover the
[1:57:56.880 --> 1:57:58.880]  bill well they don't do it by paying taxes
[1:57:58.880 --> 1:58:00.880]  they do it by printing money and that just
[1:58:00.880 --> 1:58:02.880]  means. Jed let me give them the number for
[1:58:02.880 --> 1:58:04.880]  those three coins silver coins
[1:58:04.880 --> 1:58:06.880]  and two different gold coins
[1:58:06.880 --> 1:58:08.880]  you're offering you cannot beat this deal
[1:58:08.880 --> 1:58:10.880]  one eight hundred six eight six
[1:58:10.880 --> 1:58:12.880]  two two three seven eight hundred
[1:58:12.880 --> 1:58:14.880]  six eight six two two three seven
[1:58:14.880 --> 1:58:16.880]  Ted how long can you hold those
[1:58:16.880 --> 1:58:18.880]  I will hold them all throughout the day
[1:58:18.880 --> 1:58:20.880]  and I'll do it tomorrow and hopefully I can keep it through the weekend
[1:58:20.880 --> 1:58:22.880]  but we'll have to watch the market I'll be up
[1:58:22.880 --> 1:58:24.880]  tomorrow and we'll talk about that. Well hold on Ted
[1:58:24.880 --> 1:58:26.880]  I want to hear more what you think the markets are going to get back

[1:59:10.880 --> 1:59:12.880]  awakening has taken place
[1:59:12.880 --> 1:59:14.880]  an inside job
[1:59:14.880 --> 1:59:16.880]  how dare you
[1:59:18.880 --> 1:59:20.880]  if you know that there's
[1:59:20.880 --> 1:59:22.880]  treason going on you can be held accountable for treason yourself
[1:59:22.880 --> 1:59:24.880]  all hell is breaking loose on
[1:59:24.880 --> 1:59:26.880]  6th Avenue
[1:59:26.880 --> 1:59:28.880]  and if the government has not told the truth
[1:59:28.880 --> 1:59:30.880]  in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary
[1:59:30.880 --> 1:59:32.880]  of 9-11
[1:59:32.880 --> 1:59:34.880]  download the film at prisonplanet.tv

[1:59:36.880 --> 1:59:38.880]  it's now time to take the
[1:59:38.880 --> 2:00:06.880]  revolution at the next level
[2:00:12.880 --> 2:00:14.880]  man you look at the stock market it's shooting up and down
[2:00:14.880 --> 2:00:16.880]  down overall gold
[2:00:16.880 --> 2:00:18.880]  shooting up and down wildly
[2:00:20.880 --> 2:00:22.880]  we study 1929
[2:00:22.880 --> 2:00:24.880]  for 6-8 months it went up and down just like this
[2:00:26.880 --> 2:00:28.880]  but the market fundamentals are far worse
[2:00:28.880 --> 2:00:30.880]  now than they were then I mean the level
[2:00:30.880 --> 2:00:32.880]  of just fraud
[2:00:32.880 --> 2:00:34.880]  all these reports are coming out that banks won't release their
[2:00:34.880 --> 2:00:36.880]  financials and when they do like city group
[2:00:36.880 --> 2:00:38.880]  it's trillions
[2:00:38.880 --> 2:00:40.880]  in stuff
[2:00:40.880 --> 2:00:42.880]  they're claiming triple A rate but they won't say what it is
[2:00:42.880 --> 2:00:44.880]  and then they look closer it's narcotics
[2:00:44.880 --> 2:00:46.880]  they've all been caught many times
[2:00:46.880 --> 2:00:48.880]  that's your government folks
[2:00:48.880 --> 2:00:50.880]  the people who own and run our country
[2:00:50.880 --> 2:00:52.880]  they run the drugs, the white slavery
[2:00:52.880 --> 2:00:54.880]  I mean
[2:00:54.880 --> 2:00:56.880]  Dincorn Halliburton publicly run child kidnapping operations
[2:00:56.880 --> 2:00:58.880]  don't laugh at me police
[2:00:58.880 --> 2:01:00.880]  you google that
[2:01:00.880 --> 2:01:02.880]  oh but you know you're in such a tyranny you're afraid to google it
[2:01:02.880 --> 2:01:04.880]  knowing they're tracking all that
[2:01:04.880 --> 2:01:06.880]  you don't want your bosses knowing you know
[2:01:06.880 --> 2:01:08.880]  gotta play dumb so they can win
[2:01:08.880 --> 2:01:10.880]  no you don't want them to win
[2:01:10.880 --> 2:01:12.880]  you want to go check out
[2:01:12.880 --> 2:01:14.880]  if Chicago Tribune reported that Dincorn Halliburton
[2:01:14.880 --> 2:01:16.880]  run child kidnapping
[2:01:16.880 --> 2:01:18.880]  I've had the guts to get up here
[2:01:18.880 --> 2:01:20.880]  and talk about these bastards
[2:01:20.880 --> 2:01:22.880]  because I know we don't have any hope
[2:01:22.880 --> 2:01:24.880]  unless we stand up
[2:01:24.880 --> 2:01:26.880]  do you compute that
[2:01:26.880 --> 2:01:28.880]  stop your denial
[2:01:30.880 --> 2:01:32.880]  Ted Anderson
[2:01:32.880 --> 2:01:34.880]  we got a few minutes left I'm going to come back and take calls
[2:01:38.880 --> 2:01:40.880]  again you've been in the brokerage business
[2:01:40.880 --> 2:01:42.880]  for I don't know 28 almost 30 years
[2:01:42.880 --> 2:01:44.880]  have you ever seen anything like this
[2:01:44.880 --> 2:01:46.880]  no it's never been like this
[2:01:46.880 --> 2:01:48.880]  I started when Jimmy Carter was in office
[2:01:48.880 --> 2:01:50.880]  and we had runaway inflation
[2:01:50.880 --> 2:01:52.880]  and the gold and silver prices
[2:01:52.880 --> 2:01:54.880]  silver ran up to 50 and gold
[2:01:54.880 --> 2:01:56.880]  ran up to 800
[2:01:56.880 --> 2:01:58.880]  and I looked at it at that point in time
[2:01:58.880 --> 2:02:00.880]  I thought that was nuts now we have short supply
[2:02:00.880 --> 2:02:02.880]  we can't get enough of it
[2:02:02.880 --> 2:02:04.880]  there's twice as much demand
[2:02:04.880 --> 2:02:06.880]  the value of the currency is falling through the floor
[2:02:06.880 --> 2:02:08.880]  the banks are being shut down
[2:02:08.880 --> 2:02:10.880]  the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
[2:02:10.880 --> 2:02:12.880]  I mean come on that's FHA
[2:02:12.880 --> 2:02:14.880]  mortgages
[2:02:14.880 --> 2:02:16.880]  these are the things that everybody talked about
[2:02:16.880 --> 2:02:18.880]  happening and speculated that could possibly
[2:02:18.880 --> 2:02:20.880]  be a problem and now all of a sudden
[2:02:20.880 --> 2:02:22.880]  here they are sitting right here
[2:02:22.880 --> 2:02:24.880]  burning in front of us it's happening
[2:02:24.880 --> 2:02:26.880]  Alex
[2:02:26.880 --> 2:02:28.880]  I shouldn't be amazed
[2:02:28.880 --> 2:02:30.880]  by this because of all the study that I've done
[2:02:30.880 --> 2:02:32.880]  and I've always known it was going to happen
[2:02:32.880 --> 2:02:34.880]  but it still is baffling
[2:02:34.880 --> 2:02:36.880]  to me when I see it
[2:02:36.880 --> 2:02:38.880]  and like you
[2:02:38.880 --> 2:02:40.880]  I've got a daughter
[2:02:40.880 --> 2:02:42.880]  and two boys and I'm thinking about their future
[2:02:42.880 --> 2:02:44.880]  and just
[2:02:44.880 --> 2:02:46.880]  hope to God that the people of the United States
[2:02:46.880 --> 2:02:48.880]  can smarten up
[2:02:48.880 --> 2:02:50.880]  and insist upon
[2:02:50.880 --> 2:02:52.880]  a solid sound currency
[2:02:52.880 --> 2:02:54.880]  so this kind of thing won't happen again in the future
[2:02:54.880 --> 2:02:56.880]  but
[2:02:56.880 --> 2:02:58.880]  you know here we are sitting here
[2:02:58.880 --> 2:03:00.880]  and they're going to say oh the next thing
[2:03:00.880 --> 2:03:02.880]  we need to do to solve this problem
[2:03:02.880 --> 2:03:04.880]  is to have the government bail this out
[2:03:04.880 --> 2:03:06.880]  and then have the government bail that out
[2:03:06.880 --> 2:03:08.880]  the government bailing out our problems
[2:03:08.880 --> 2:03:10.880]  is our problem in the start
[2:03:10.880 --> 2:03:12.880]  and every ad I was watching CNN last night
[2:03:12.880 --> 2:03:14.880]  and Fox and it was almost every ad
[2:03:14.880 --> 2:03:16.880]  probably half of them or more
[2:03:16.880 --> 2:03:18.880]  was global greenhouse gases that
[2:03:18.880 --> 2:03:20.880]  global tax this, global tax that
[2:03:20.880 --> 2:03:22.880]  and now the central banks say
[2:03:22.880 --> 2:03:24.880]  they have all this hype about solar panels
[2:03:24.880 --> 2:03:26.880]  and this and that that all is good
[2:03:26.880 --> 2:03:28.880]  and then that sells the people
[2:03:28.880 --> 2:03:30.880]  and they tag on to it oh by the way
[2:03:30.880 --> 2:03:32.880]  we're going to have a global tax
[2:03:32.880 --> 2:03:34.880]  so that's how they sell people
[2:03:34.880 --> 2:03:36.880]  is by connecting the global tax on to some other things
[2:03:36.880 --> 2:03:38.880]  that are reasonable you know it's kind of like
[2:03:38.880 --> 2:03:40.880]  coding a cyanide pill
[2:03:40.880 --> 2:03:42.880]  inside of a jelly bean so you'll go ahead
[2:03:42.880 --> 2:03:44.880]  and swallow it but there's cyanide inside
[2:03:44.880 --> 2:03:46.880]  there and
[2:03:46.880 --> 2:03:48.880]  then I think about the fact that
[2:03:48.880 --> 2:03:50.880]  the elites from
[2:03:50.880 --> 2:03:52.880]  the president to the vice president to all
[2:03:52.880 --> 2:03:54.880]  the money people Carl Rove just
[2:03:54.880 --> 2:03:56.880]  ran out of the country under indictment
[2:03:56.880 --> 2:03:58.880]  they're all moving to the
[2:03:58.880 --> 2:04:00.880]  Cook Islands and and and to Spain
[2:04:00.880 --> 2:04:02.880]  and to Portugal and
[2:04:02.880 --> 2:04:04.880]  Switzerland and to
[2:04:04.880 --> 2:04:06.880]  Dubai and and and the companies
[2:04:06.880 --> 2:04:08.880]  are all moving out of the US
[2:04:08.880 --> 2:04:10.880]  I mean
[2:04:10.880 --> 2:04:12.880]  they've never evacuated like this what
[2:04:12.880 --> 2:04:14.880]  are they going to do well that's just
[2:04:14.880 --> 2:04:16.880]  it Alex I mean the handwriting is on the wall
[2:04:16.880 --> 2:04:18.880]  we hear the citizens of the United
[2:04:18.880 --> 2:04:20.880]  States should know better we have to do
[2:04:20.880 --> 2:04:22.880]  something to protect ourselves call us at
[2:04:22.880 --> 2:04:24.880]  1-800-686-2237
[2:04:24.880 --> 2:04:26.880]  ask for the golden silver deals
[2:04:26.880 --> 2:04:28.880]  if you have over a hundred thousand dollars
[2:04:28.880 --> 2:04:30.880]  in a bank account there's no excuse for you
[2:04:30.880 --> 2:04:32.880]  you should be getting that out and get it out
[2:04:32.880 --> 2:04:34.880]  now well we'll just
[2:04:34.880 --> 2:04:36.880]  say we told them so again some people
[2:04:36.880 --> 2:04:38.880]  will listen 800-686-2237
[2:04:38.880 --> 2:04:40.880]  you cannot
[2:04:40.880 --> 2:04:42.880]  beat those deals that were just offered
[2:04:42.880 --> 2:04:44.880]  you cannot beat them Ted thanks for talking to us
[2:04:44.880 --> 2:04:46.880]  thanks for having me up Alex
[2:04:46.880 --> 2:04:48.880]  our beloved Republic
[2:04:48.880 --> 2:04:50.880]  is on her knees the forces of globalism
[2:04:50.880 --> 2:04:52.880]  are destroying national sovereignty
[2:04:52.880 --> 2:04:54.880]  worldwide but in Liberty's darkest hour
[2:04:54.880 --> 2:04:56.880]  there is hope the first time in modern
[2:04:56.880 --> 2:04:58.880]  history the people are beginning to wake up
[2:04:58.880 --> 2:05:00.880]  it is essential that patriots worldwide
[2:05:00.880 --> 2:05:02.880]  accelerate their fellow man's understanding
[2:05:02.880 --> 2:05:04.880]  of the new world order master plan

[2:06:48.880 --> 2:06:50.880]  pH balance is one of the most important factors
[2:06:50.880 --> 2:06:52.880]  in maintaining high energy
[2:06:52.880 --> 2:06:54.880]  and vibrant health most experts agree
[2:06:54.880 --> 2:06:56.880]  that the water you drink should be at a pH level
[2:06:56.880 --> 2:06:58.880]  of 9 or higher
[2:06:58.880 --> 2:07:00.880]  plasma pH drops combine
[2:07:00.880 --> 2:07:02.880]  a unique formula of the most alkaline
[2:07:02.880 --> 2:07:04.880]  minerals and elements this product
[2:07:04.880 --> 2:07:06.880]  is a one of a kind in its strength
[2:07:06.880 --> 2:07:08.880]  and effectiveness using plasma
[2:07:08.880 --> 2:07:10.880]  pH drops is one of the best ways

[2:09:32.880 --> 2:09:34.880]  hi
[2:09:34.880 --> 2:09:36.880]  hello
[2:09:36.880 --> 2:09:38.880]  yeah bro we're talking right now
[2:09:38.880 --> 2:09:40.880]  hey alex good afternoon
[2:09:40.880 --> 2:09:42.880]  I'm just going to drop a couple info bombs
[2:09:42.880 --> 2:09:44.880]  first my brother works in New York DMV
[2:09:44.880 --> 2:09:46.880]  the real ID scanners are there
[2:09:46.880 --> 2:09:48.880]  they are very real
[2:09:48.880 --> 2:09:50.880]  I also work in the automotive industry
[2:09:50.880 --> 2:09:52.880]  and OBD-3
[2:09:52.880 --> 2:09:54.880]  essentially they're going to tattle on
[2:09:54.880 --> 2:09:56.880]  whether your car is polluting too much
[2:09:56.880 --> 2:09:58.880]  they could tax you
[2:09:58.880 --> 2:10:00.880]  that's coming 2009-2010
[2:10:00.880 --> 2:10:02.880]  well so let me stop you
[2:10:02.880 --> 2:10:04.880]  let me stop you
[2:10:04.880 --> 2:10:06.880]  that's the whole future of the world
[2:10:06.880 --> 2:10:08.880]  since you bring that up people don't know these technical terms
[2:10:08.880 --> 2:10:10.880]  sir we have to tell them
[2:10:10.880 --> 2:10:12.880]  the minute your insurance is out
[2:10:12.880 --> 2:10:14.880]  you're going to be pulled over by police
[2:10:14.880 --> 2:10:16.880]  unless you're an illegal alien they've been ordered to leave them alone
[2:10:16.880 --> 2:10:18.880]  the minute you speed
[2:10:18.880 --> 2:10:20.880]  you're going to be taxed
[2:10:20.880 --> 2:10:22.880]  the minute your car gets some bad gas
[2:10:22.880 --> 2:10:24.880]  you're going to get bills
[2:10:24.880 --> 2:10:26.880]  so on top of the economy and polluting
[2:10:26.880 --> 2:10:28.880]  just like in the Great Depression
[2:10:28.880 --> 2:10:30.880]  bulldozers running over your houses
[2:10:30.880 --> 2:10:32.880]  pickered in security with shotguns and Tommy guns
[2:10:32.880 --> 2:10:34.880]  mowing you down
[2:10:34.880 --> 2:10:36.880]  Rockefeller hired thugs
[2:10:36.880 --> 2:10:38.880]  riding people in towns down by the hundreds
[2:10:38.880 --> 2:10:40.880]  on a weekly basis
[2:10:40.880 --> 2:10:42.880]  they are gearing up for just a massive
[2:10:42.880 --> 2:10:44.880]  route of the scum slaves
[2:10:44.880 --> 2:10:46.880]  you go ahead and finish up
[2:10:46.880 --> 2:10:48.880]  okay I just wanted to add that
[2:10:48.880 --> 2:10:50.880]  I believe Ventura did not live up
[2:10:50.880 --> 2:10:52.880]  to the title of his book
[2:10:52.880 --> 2:10:54.880]  even if he wasn't going to win
[2:10:54.880 --> 2:10:56.880]  whether he's going to win we need people to speak up
[2:10:56.880 --> 2:10:58.880]  if we don't have enough people like Ron Paul
[2:10:58.880 --> 2:11:00.880]  Dennis Kucinich
[2:11:00.880 --> 2:11:02.880]  it's pretty much going to be all over
[2:11:02.880 --> 2:11:04.880]  we all need to be in on this
[2:11:04.880 --> 2:11:06.880]  and also because I teach
[2:11:06.880 --> 2:11:08.880]  when it's not during the summer
[2:11:08.880 --> 2:11:10.880]  did you ever talk about the victory in Texas concerning
[2:11:10.880 --> 2:11:12.880]  the trans-sexist corridor stopping it
[2:11:12.880 --> 2:11:14.880]  well I know the John Burt society said that
[2:11:14.880 --> 2:11:16.880]  but they've announced three times
[2:11:16.880 --> 2:11:18.880]  that they've cancelled it
[2:11:18.880 --> 2:11:20.880]  only to re-upload again
[2:11:20.880 --> 2:11:22.880]  remember the governor
[2:11:22.880 --> 2:11:24.880]  the legislature passed a law
[2:11:24.880 --> 2:11:26.880]  a year and a half ago shooting it down
[2:11:26.880 --> 2:11:28.880]  but now two years ago
[2:11:28.880 --> 2:11:30.880]  but Perry went ahead with it
[2:11:30.880 --> 2:11:32.880]  and so that is not really true
[2:11:32.880 --> 2:11:34.880]  so it's not
[2:11:34.880 --> 2:11:36.880]  then what stage is it at
[2:11:36.880 --> 2:11:38.880]  well sir I mean they're putting
[2:11:38.880 --> 2:11:40.880]  toll roads in on existing roads
[2:11:40.880 --> 2:11:42.880]  all over the state right now
[2:11:42.880 --> 2:11:44.880]  they're also to get around federal law
[2:11:44.880 --> 2:11:46.880]  about putting a toll road on existing roads
[2:11:46.880 --> 2:11:48.880]  they're adding lanes to
[2:11:48.880 --> 2:11:50.880]  roads they are blocking the highway
[2:11:50.880 --> 2:11:52.880]  so you can't exit and get off
[2:11:52.880 --> 2:11:54.880]  just like it is in other areas
[2:11:54.880 --> 2:11:56.880]  the toll road of 35 going into Kansas
[2:11:56.880 --> 2:11:58.880]  in Oklahoma
[2:11:58.880 --> 2:12:00.880]  Northern Oklahoma into Kansas same thing here
[2:12:00.880 --> 2:12:02.880]  it's going to be happening
[2:12:02.880 --> 2:12:04.880]  well they can only get away with it if they RFID chip
[2:12:04.880 --> 2:12:06.880]  inspection stickers
[2:12:06.880 --> 2:12:08.880]  and your IDs so it's the best thing
[2:12:08.880 --> 2:12:10.880]  we could do right now is to mark away
[2:12:10.880 --> 2:12:12.880]  I'm sorry bud
[2:12:12.880 --> 2:12:14.880]  but that's why the Texas law makes it a criminal offense
[2:12:14.880 --> 2:12:16.880]  to change those and yes they use
[2:12:16.880 --> 2:12:18.880]  tags and text tags and all the names
[2:12:18.880 --> 2:12:20.880]  to track everywhere you go
[2:12:20.880 --> 2:12:22.880]  the Pentagon at least eight years ago put up
[2:12:22.880 --> 2:12:24.880]  readers that can read
[2:12:24.880 --> 2:12:26.880]  multi types of those RFID chips
[2:12:26.880 --> 2:12:28.880]  and are scanning you and using that as
[2:12:28.880 --> 2:12:30.880]  another way to track you they also use cell
[2:12:30.880 --> 2:12:32.880]  phones to track you and of course
[2:12:32.880 --> 2:12:34.880]  license plate scanners to track you
[2:12:34.880 --> 2:12:36.880]  and then now they have face scanners
[2:12:36.880 --> 2:12:38.880]  that track you and
[2:12:38.880 --> 2:12:40.880]  absolutely it is just total hell grid
[2:12:40.880 --> 2:12:42.880]  all Pentagon run
[2:12:42.880 --> 2:12:44.880]  well you know the Panopticon state
[2:12:44.880 --> 2:12:46.880]  really coming up
[2:12:46.880 --> 2:12:48.880]  but people are waking up I mean even Howard Stern
[2:12:48.880 --> 2:12:50.880]  talked about Lindsay Williams today and started playing
[2:12:50.880 --> 2:12:52.880]  how um there's no oil crisis
[2:12:52.880 --> 2:12:54.880]  um Lindsay Williams I mean the man's a genius
[2:12:54.880 --> 2:12:56.880]  he predicted four or five dollar barrel
[2:12:56.880 --> 2:12:58.880]  oil right after the war in Iraq
[2:12:58.880 --> 2:13:00.880]  I mean no one had the uh coley owns to say
[2:13:00.880 --> 2:13:02.880]  something like that so it's unbelievable
[2:13:02.880 --> 2:13:04.880]  um I hear you and I appreciate your call
[2:13:04.880 --> 2:13:06.880]  I gotta jump let me let me just say this Lindsay's a great guy
[2:13:06.880 --> 2:13:08.880]  but uh we
[2:13:08.880 --> 2:13:10.880]  hang so much of what we say on him
[2:13:10.880 --> 2:13:12.880]  everybody well Lindsay Williams said
[2:13:12.880 --> 2:13:14.880]  you know he was a pastor
[2:13:14.880 --> 2:13:16.880]  and he worked for Atlantic Richfield
[2:13:18.880 --> 2:13:20.880]  and he was up there on the north slope
[2:13:20.880 --> 2:13:22.880]  and he saw him cap him
[2:13:22.880 --> 2:13:24.880]  but then we have the oil companies
[2:13:24.880 --> 2:13:26.880]  we have lawsuits we have congressional reports
[2:13:26.880 --> 2:13:28.880]  uh we have the fact that they
[2:13:28.880 --> 2:13:30.880]  capped wells all over the U.S.
[2:13:30.880 --> 2:13:32.880]  we have the fact that there's as much oil
[2:13:32.880 --> 2:13:34.880]  in one area of the Gulf of Mexico as there is
[2:13:34.880 --> 2:13:36.880]  there and they're not letting us have that
[2:13:36.880 --> 2:13:38.880]  you know Bush knew Congress would block it
[2:13:38.880 --> 2:13:40.880]  and he said oh I'm taking my
[2:13:40.880 --> 2:13:42.880]  control off of it in some areas
[2:13:42.880 --> 2:13:44.880]  okay
[2:13:44.880 --> 2:13:46.880]  and so yes Lindsay Williams did see it
[2:13:46.880 --> 2:13:48.880]  Lindsay Williams is right Lindsay Williams is a great guy
[2:13:48.880 --> 2:13:50.880]  but just going off what he says
[2:13:50.880 --> 2:13:52.880]  isn't enough
[2:13:52.880 --> 2:13:54.880]  we have all this other proof and no
[2:13:54.880 --> 2:13:56.880]  we said we would be paying
[2:13:56.880 --> 2:13:58.880]  four dollars a gallon
[2:13:58.880 --> 2:14:00.880]  uh by 2008
[2:14:00.880 --> 2:14:02.880]  because we got that from the
[2:14:02.880 --> 2:14:04.880]  Bilderberg group
[2:14:04.880 --> 2:14:06.880]  and we said we'd be paying three dollars a gallon
[2:14:06.880 --> 2:14:08.880]  right because we had Bilderberg
[2:14:08.880 --> 2:14:10.880]  group leaks that's where all
[2:14:10.880 --> 2:14:12.880]  that came from it came from Jim Tucker
[2:14:12.880 --> 2:14:14.880]  okay
[2:14:14.880 --> 2:14:16.880]  and that's my point
[2:14:16.880 --> 2:14:18.880]  is we have the documents here's the deal
[2:14:18.880 --> 2:14:20.880]  how did I know they were going to plunge the
[2:14:20.880 --> 2:14:22.880]  dollar how did I know
[2:14:22.880 --> 2:14:24.880]  they were going to
[2:14:24.880 --> 2:14:26.880]  uh
[2:14:26.880 --> 2:14:28.880]  engineer a collapse of our economy because
[2:14:28.880 --> 2:14:30.880]  Joseph Sticklets left
[2:14:30.880 --> 2:14:32.880]  the World Bank
[2:14:32.880 --> 2:14:34.880]  in
[2:14:34.880 --> 2:14:36.880]  February of 2002
[2:14:36.880 --> 2:14:38.880]  and then the day he left
[2:14:38.880 --> 2:14:40.880]  2000 plus pages
[2:14:42.880 --> 2:14:44.880]  of secret IMF World Bank
[2:14:44.880 --> 2:14:46.880]  conferences and
[2:14:46.880 --> 2:14:48.880]  battle plans
[2:14:48.880 --> 2:14:50.880]  were facts
[2:14:50.880 --> 2:14:52.880]  to ABC, CBS
[2:14:52.880 --> 2:14:54.880]  NBC, BBC
[2:14:54.880 --> 2:14:56.880]  Fox and others
[2:14:56.880 --> 2:14:58.880]  and none of them reported on it
[2:14:58.880 --> 2:15:00.880]  but Gregg
[2:15:00.880 --> 2:15:02.880]  Palast and so we got
[2:15:02.880 --> 2:15:04.880]  some of the documents we had him on
[2:15:04.880 --> 2:15:06.880]  and he said the documents said they're going to bring
[2:15:06.880 --> 2:15:08.880]  Venice try to kidnap
[2:15:08.880 --> 2:15:10.880]  and kill Hugo Chavez next month and it happened
[2:15:10.880 --> 2:15:12.880]  and then it shows down the road
[2:15:12.880 --> 2:15:14.880]  five six seven years they plan
[2:15:14.880 --> 2:15:16.880]  to implode the U.S. like they've done in Latin America
[2:15:16.880 --> 2:15:18.880]  and totally devalue
[2:15:18.880 --> 2:15:20.880]  the currency and rob everybody
[2:15:20.880 --> 2:15:22.880]  well guess what
[2:15:22.880 --> 2:15:24.880]  they're now doing I mean
[2:15:26.880 --> 2:15:28.880]  people have
[2:15:28.880 --> 2:15:30.880]  debates
[2:15:30.880 --> 2:15:32.880]  about
[2:15:34.880 --> 2:15:36.880]  whether or not there
[2:15:36.880 --> 2:15:38.880]  the new world order is going to do this or that
[2:15:38.880 --> 2:15:40.880]  or why oil prices are high
[2:15:40.880 --> 2:15:42.880]  they have debates about what's making oil go up
[2:15:42.880 --> 2:15:44.880]  we know the dollar
[2:15:44.880 --> 2:15:46.880]  has been devalued and then
[2:15:46.880 --> 2:15:48.880]  threats of attacking Iran have accelerated
[2:15:48.880 --> 2:15:50.880]  speculation and dumping
[2:15:50.880 --> 2:15:52.880]  of the dollar and that's what's done it
[2:15:52.880 --> 2:15:54.880]  and then of course
[2:15:54.880 --> 2:15:56.880]  if we had a true free market
[2:15:56.880 --> 2:15:58.880]  that wouldn't have happened because people would just
[2:15:58.880 --> 2:16:00.880]  start pumping more
[2:16:00.880 --> 2:16:02.880]  but because our government's corrupt
[2:16:02.880 --> 2:16:04.880]  and laid off the oil fields in Utah
[2:16:04.880 --> 2:16:06.880]  and Oklahoma and Texas
[2:16:06.880 --> 2:16:08.880]  and the Dakotas and
[2:16:08.880 --> 2:16:10.880]  and out of Oregon all these places that are
[2:16:10.880 --> 2:16:12.880]  50 60 70 80
[2:16:12.880 --> 2:16:14.880]  90% government owned
[2:16:14.880 --> 2:16:16.880]  they won't let you have the clean burning coal
[2:16:16.880 --> 2:16:18.880]  they won't let you have the natural gas

[2:16:46.880 --> 2:16:48.880]  totally manipulating you
[2:16:48.880 --> 2:16:50.880]  all of them picked by behavioral psychologists
[2:16:50.880 --> 2:16:52.880]  and top admin

[2:17:14.880 --> 2:17:16.880]  she's reading off a teleprompter
[2:17:16.880 --> 2:17:18.880]  even the giggles and the fake smirks
[2:17:18.880 --> 2:17:20.880]  and the batting of the eyes
[2:17:20.880 --> 2:17:22.880]  and the coached on how to do that
[2:17:22.880 --> 2:17:24.880]  to sell you that everything's alright
[2:17:24.880 --> 2:17:26.880]  while they put you up there in the slaughter shoot
[2:17:28.880 --> 2:17:30.880]  you know what a slaughter shoot is

[2:17:46.880 --> 2:17:48.880]  and blaming it on the oil companies
[2:17:48.880 --> 2:17:50.880]  and the oil companies are to blame
[2:17:50.880 --> 2:17:52.880]  but only into blocking
[2:17:54.880 --> 2:17:56.880]  the refining of gas
[2:17:56.880 --> 2:17:58.880]  and trying to use environmental

[2:23:56.880 --> 2:23:58.880]  hello Alex how are you? Good sir
[2:23:58.880 --> 2:24:00.880]  I just wanted to report on the
[2:24:00.880 --> 2:24:02.880]  fact that the
[2:24:02.880 --> 2:24:04.880]  March in DC on July 12th was
[2:24:04.880 --> 2:24:06.880]  absolutely amazing and that kind of
[2:24:06.880 --> 2:24:08.880]  energy is just resonating among the people
[2:24:08.880 --> 2:24:10.880]  people are starting to find out
[2:24:10.880 --> 2:24:12.880]  I'm very excited about it
[2:24:12.880 --> 2:24:14.880]  and me and Jackie Smith
[2:24:14.880 --> 2:24:16.880]  are actually going to put together something
[2:24:16.880 --> 2:24:18.880]  in Baton Rouge Louisiana
[2:24:18.880 --> 2:24:20.880]  a march
[2:24:20.880 --> 2:24:22.880]  hopefully the same caliber
[2:24:22.880 --> 2:24:24.880]  and because this is the only way that we can get it out
[2:24:24.880 --> 2:24:26.880]  to the people
[2:24:26.880 --> 2:24:28.880]  what do you think about it?
[2:24:28.880 --> 2:24:30.880]  I think all action resistance
[2:24:30.880 --> 2:24:32.880]  is victory tell us how
[2:24:32.880 --> 2:24:34.880]  the Ron Paul rally went
[2:24:34.880 --> 2:24:36.880]  in how many people you think
[2:24:36.880 --> 2:24:38.880]  were there on Saturday in DC?
[2:24:38.880 --> 2:24:40.880]  Oh let's say around
[2:24:40.880 --> 2:24:42.880]  between 10 and 15,000
[2:24:42.880 --> 2:24:44.880]  for sure
[2:24:44.880 --> 2:24:46.880]  I also heard that there were about
[2:24:46.880 --> 2:24:48.880]  70,000 to 100,000 people who watched it live
[2:24:48.880 --> 2:24:50.880]  via the net
[2:24:50.880 --> 2:24:52.880]  and uh
[2:24:52.880 --> 2:24:54.880]  I mean that's just another victory in my opinion
[2:24:54.880 --> 2:24:56.880]  I
[2:24:56.880 --> 2:24:58.880]  I'm so
[2:24:58.880 --> 2:25:00.880]  like from this rally
[2:25:00.880 --> 2:25:02.880]  I'm still inspired like this kind of energy
[2:25:02.880 --> 2:25:04.880]  it's just people are finding out without
[2:25:04.880 --> 2:25:06.880]  you even
[2:25:06.880 --> 2:25:08.880]  that mainstream media doesn't have to report it
[2:25:08.880 --> 2:25:10.880]  people are just finding out because of the energy
[2:25:10.880 --> 2:25:12.880]  of the movement's resonating
[2:25:12.880 --> 2:25:14.880]  and it just
[2:25:14.880 --> 2:25:16.880]  it pumped me up
[2:25:16.880 --> 2:25:18.880]  I hear you I saw videos of it
[2:25:18.880 --> 2:25:20.880]  and it looked like about 15,000 people
[2:25:20.880 --> 2:25:22.880]  I appreciate your call that's what the
[2:25:22.880 --> 2:25:24.880]  uh that's what the
[2:25:24.880 --> 2:25:26.880]  mall police
[2:25:26.880 --> 2:25:28.880]  estimated 10 to 15,000
[2:25:28.880 --> 2:25:30.880]  they're pretty good at estimating crowds
[2:25:30.880 --> 2:25:32.880]  told they were enjoying snapping shots
[2:25:32.880 --> 2:25:34.880]  of the people
[2:25:34.880 --> 2:25:36.880]  got to take photos of citizens that want to come out
[2:25:36.880 --> 2:25:38.880]  and call for change that's bad
[2:25:38.880 --> 2:25:40.880]  got to watch them they're evil
[2:25:40.880 --> 2:25:42.880]  got to
[2:25:42.880 --> 2:25:44.880]  boss the citizens around in DC
[2:25:44.880 --> 2:25:46.880]  I've never seen anything like it except in New York
[2:25:46.880 --> 2:25:48.880]  I mean they just walk up
[2:25:48.880 --> 2:25:50.880]  and boss and talk down to everybody letting them know
[2:25:50.880 --> 2:25:52.880]  we own you cattle
[2:25:52.880 --> 2:25:54.880]  well that's true but the bankers
[2:25:54.880 --> 2:25:56.880]  own you too and they're going to hurt you just as bad
[2:25:56.880 --> 2:25:58.880]  so get ready for your for your mommy
[2:25:58.880 --> 2:26:00.880]  the government to hurt you Dan in New Jersey

[2:26:02.880 --> 2:26:04.880]  hey Alex what's going on
[2:26:04.880 --> 2:26:06.880]  worldwide transmission against
[2:26:06.880 --> 2:26:08.880]  tyranny all right
[2:26:08.880 --> 2:26:10.880]  I'm a huge fan
[2:26:10.880 --> 2:26:12.880]  listen I really like to see you like
[2:26:12.880 --> 2:26:14.880]  do a phone interview with like the Howard Stern show
[2:26:14.880 --> 2:26:16.880]  because I'm tired of these guys
[2:26:16.880 --> 2:26:18.880]  just treating you and and the others like it
[2:26:18.880 --> 2:26:20.880]  it's a joke
[2:26:20.880 --> 2:26:22.880]  and I know you said before that they
[2:26:22.880 --> 2:26:24.880]  contacted you and said you know hey come on
[2:26:24.880 --> 2:26:26.880]  and uh you know be goofy for us
[2:26:26.880 --> 2:26:28.880]  but honestly I've heard them before
[2:26:28.880 --> 2:26:30.880]  and they really just don't get it
[2:26:30.880 --> 2:26:32.880]  like if you go on there and
[2:26:32.880 --> 2:26:34.880]  and just you know tell them about
[2:26:34.880 --> 2:26:36.880]  the physics of 9-11 and what really happened
[2:26:36.880 --> 2:26:38.880]  I think he would also
[2:26:38.880 --> 2:26:40.880]  Howard Stern is real smart
[2:26:40.880 --> 2:26:42.880]  and
[2:26:42.880 --> 2:26:44.880]  he plays down to low grade morons
[2:26:44.880 --> 2:26:46.880]  and
[2:26:46.880 --> 2:26:48.880]  and tries to fool people
[2:26:48.880 --> 2:26:50.880]  that he doesn't know that he knows all about it
[2:26:50.880 --> 2:26:52.880]  I've been called by their producers before
[2:26:52.880 --> 2:26:54.880]  and
[2:26:54.880 --> 2:26:56.880]  they think their hundreds of millions
[2:26:56.880 --> 2:26:58.880]  is going to keep them safe and so good luck
[2:26:58.880 --> 2:27:00.880]  good luck to them
[2:27:00.880 --> 2:27:02.880]  I mean Howard Stern
[2:27:02.880 --> 2:27:04.880]  is going to wake up when people are jumping out of buildings
[2:27:04.880 --> 2:27:06.880]  like 1929
[2:27:06.880 --> 2:27:08.880]  and then it's going to be too late for him
[2:27:08.880 --> 2:27:10.880]  and so this is what they want this is what they get
[2:27:10.880 --> 2:27:12.880]  this is what you want folks you're going to get it
[2:27:12.880 --> 2:27:14.880]  okay you want hardcore Nazi
[2:27:14.880 --> 2:27:16.880]  Germany you're going to get it
[2:27:16.880 --> 2:27:18.880]  Alex I just
[2:27:18.880 --> 2:27:20.880]  I love everything you're doing keep fighting the good fight
[2:27:20.880 --> 2:27:22.880]  and you know death in the world
[2:27:22.880 --> 2:27:24.880]  order thanks man I hear you my friend
[2:27:24.880 --> 2:27:26.880]  we got two calls in a row mentioning Howard Stern
[2:27:26.880 --> 2:27:28.880]  I've heard he's been talking about 9-11
[2:27:28.880 --> 2:27:30.880]  might be an inside job I heard he's been
[2:27:30.880 --> 2:27:32.880]  talking about how they're staging
[2:27:32.880 --> 2:27:34.880]  everything now and that's good
[2:27:34.880 --> 2:27:36.880]  but
[2:27:36.880 --> 2:27:40.880]  it's a little
[2:27:40.880 --> 2:27:42.880]  late for that with Howard Stern
[2:27:42.880 --> 2:27:44.880]  I mean he's just credited himself so bad
[2:27:44.880 --> 2:27:46.880]  that you know who knows
[2:27:46.880 --> 2:27:48.880]  here's the deal
[2:27:48.880 --> 2:27:50.880]  Howard Stern
[2:27:50.880 --> 2:27:54.880]  paying attention to us doesn't make or break us
[2:27:54.880 --> 2:27:56.880]  you make or break this movement
[2:27:56.880 --> 2:27:58.880]  against tyranny look in the mirror
[2:27:58.880 --> 2:28:00.880]  that's the only thing standing between
[2:28:00.880 --> 2:28:02.880]  the new world order and
[2:28:02.880 --> 2:28:06.880]  our freedoms our liberties our future
[2:28:06.880 --> 2:28:08.880]  okay look in the mirror
[2:28:08.880 --> 2:28:10.880]  and that's the sum of it
[2:28:10.880 --> 2:28:12.880]  take a good look at it
[2:28:12.880 --> 2:28:14.880]  that's it it's you that's all we got
[2:28:14.880 --> 2:28:16.880]  okay

[2:28:18.880 --> 2:28:20.880]  people up and people are listening now
[2:28:20.880 --> 2:28:22.880]  like they never had before now is the time
[2:28:22.880 --> 2:28:24.880]  to tell people about the new world order
[2:28:24.880 --> 2:28:26.880]  now is the time to give them a copy of
[2:28:26.880 --> 2:28:28.880]  truth rising or in-game or terror storm
[2:28:28.880 --> 2:28:30.880]  couple weeks ago I was watching terror storm
[2:28:30.880 --> 2:28:32.880]  again especially the second edition
[2:28:32.880 --> 2:28:34.880]  and I was just like this is so good

[2:28:48.880 --> 2:28:50.880]  we could have Burmese on air
[2:28:50.880 --> 2:28:52.880]  but he comes in here and does voiceovers
[2:28:52.880 --> 2:28:54.880]  and runs off of my microphone
[2:28:54.880 --> 2:28:56.880]  and then a week later it's not hooked up
[2:28:56.880 --> 2:28:58.880]  so we can have guests in here
[2:28:58.880 --> 2:29:00.880]  he's a big fan of American dictator so

[2:32:50.880 --> 2:32:52.880]  proudly presents
[2:32:52.880 --> 2:32:54.880]  the Alex Jones show

[2:33:14.880 --> 2:33:16.880]  back to your calls in a moment
[2:33:16.880 --> 2:33:18.880]  I want to just make a point about how the globalists
[2:33:18.880 --> 2:33:20.880]  manipulate people
[2:33:20.880 --> 2:33:22.880]  they've got hundreds of tricks
[2:33:22.880 --> 2:33:24.880]  they know you want to save your tribe
[2:33:24.880 --> 2:33:26.880]  they know you want to defend your people
[2:33:26.880 --> 2:33:28.880]  they know you want to give your children
[2:33:28.880 --> 2:33:36.880]  clean water to drink and clean food
[2:33:36.880 --> 2:33:40.880]  and so what they will do is
[2:33:40.880 --> 2:33:42.880]  they come out and they say
[2:33:42.880 --> 2:33:44.880]  you're an elite member of the police
[2:33:44.880 --> 2:33:46.880]  and the rest of the public are a bunch of idiots
[2:33:46.880 --> 2:33:48.880]  which tends to be true
[2:33:48.880 --> 2:33:50.880]  and you know best and you're being let in on something
[2:33:50.880 --> 2:33:52.880]  secret and this is a brother of
[2:33:52.880 --> 2:33:54.880]  that's going to take care of you
[2:33:54.880 --> 2:33:56.880]  and you go through these rites of passage
[2:33:56.880 --> 2:33:58.880]  and then you get hazed
[2:33:58.880 --> 2:34:00.880]  and then you're a member of the brotherhood
[2:34:00.880 --> 2:34:02.880]  and they've got it for the military
[2:34:02.880 --> 2:34:04.880]  they've got it for the police
[2:34:04.880 --> 2:34:06.880]  they've got it for lawyers
[2:34:06.880 --> 2:34:08.880]  they've got it for doctors
[2:34:08.880 --> 2:34:10.880]  they've got it for every system
[2:34:10.880 --> 2:34:12.880]  that's part of natural human activity
[2:34:12.880 --> 2:34:14.880]  but the globalists manipulate that
[2:34:14.880 --> 2:34:16.880]  and then they tell the environmentalist
[2:34:16.880 --> 2:34:18.880]  you're part of a guild of special brotherhood
[2:34:18.880 --> 2:34:20.880]  that has all these major problems
[2:34:20.880 --> 2:34:22.880]  and then a lot of the info you get fed is true
[2:34:22.880 --> 2:34:24.880]  and a lot of the solutions you're given
[2:34:24.880 --> 2:34:26.880]  like hey let's not throw so much stuff away
[2:34:26.880 --> 2:34:28.880]  let's not be wasteful
[2:34:28.880 --> 2:34:30.880]  let's not overeat
[2:34:30.880 --> 2:34:32.880]  let's have better windows
[2:34:32.880 --> 2:34:34.880]  let's have solar power
[2:34:34.880 --> 2:34:36.880]  let's have better gas mileage
[2:34:36.880 --> 2:34:38.880]  let's get away from oil
[2:34:38.880 --> 2:34:40.880]  a lot of reasonable things
[2:34:40.880 --> 2:34:42.880]  and then you're part of the guardians of the world
[2:34:42.880 --> 2:34:44.880]  and then you see a George Bush
[2:34:44.880 --> 2:34:46.880]  involved in lying, torture, evil, corruption
[2:34:46.880 --> 2:34:48.880]  and you're told that's conservatism
[2:34:48.880 --> 2:34:50.880]  and so now you're against conservatism
[2:34:50.880 --> 2:34:52.880]  and George Bush is against environmentalism
[2:34:52.880 --> 2:34:54.880]  so my gosh it must be great
[2:34:54.880 --> 2:34:56.880]  so Europe sees that
[2:34:56.880 --> 2:34:58.880]  and totally says okay we support
[2:34:58.880 --> 2:35:00.880]  banning outside space eaters
[2:35:00.880 --> 2:35:02.880]  and banning barbecues
[2:35:02.880 --> 2:35:04.880]  and banning fireplaces
[2:35:04.880 --> 2:35:06.880]  and banning cutting down trees on our backyards
[2:35:06.880 --> 2:35:08.880]  or building a barn
[2:35:08.880 --> 2:35:10.880]  and we support banning
[2:35:10.880 --> 2:35:12.880]  you know and cutting back
[2:35:12.880 --> 2:35:14.880]  on carbon dioxide
[2:35:14.880 --> 2:35:16.880]  and we want to be taxed
[2:35:16.880 --> 2:35:18.880]  because George Bush that evil devil is against it
[2:35:18.880 --> 2:35:20.880]  that's basic
[2:35:20.880 --> 2:35:22.880]  please don't throw me in the briar patch
[2:35:22.880 --> 2:35:24.880]  you know the story of Briar Rabbit
[2:35:24.880 --> 2:35:26.880]  you ought to go look it up
[2:35:26.880 --> 2:35:28.880]  they don't teach him in school anymore
[2:35:28.880 --> 2:35:30.880]  because they're seen as being old racist
[2:35:30.880 --> 2:35:32.880]  because it's an old fashioned story
[2:35:32.880 --> 2:35:34.880]  but the point is you got the rabbit
[2:35:34.880 --> 2:35:36.880]  and he gets grabbed by the local guy
[2:35:36.880 --> 2:35:38.880]  I forget his name
[2:35:38.880 --> 2:35:40.880]  and he tells him
[2:35:40.880 --> 2:35:42.880]  I don't want to be thrown in the briar patch
[2:35:42.880 --> 2:35:44.880]  I think it's a black slave
[2:35:44.880 --> 2:35:46.880]  I can't remember I remember reading when I was a kid
[2:35:46.880 --> 2:35:48.880]  and so he tells the black guy
[2:35:48.880 --> 2:35:50.880]  don't please don't throw me in the briar patch
[2:35:50.880 --> 2:35:52.880]  and then ha ha ha
[2:35:52.880 --> 2:35:54.880]  look at the you know dumb black guy
[2:35:54.880 --> 2:35:56.880]  he throws him in the briar patch I think that's why they don't
[2:35:56.880 --> 2:35:58.880]  but I mean not the part about the black guy
[2:35:58.880 --> 2:36:00.880]  that's the reason they don't
[2:36:00.880 --> 2:36:02.880]  ever teach those series
[2:36:02.880 --> 2:36:04.880]  of hundred plus year old stories anymore
[2:36:04.880 --> 2:36:06.880]  because it does that kind of like they banned a lot of
[2:36:06.880 --> 2:36:08.880]  Tom and Jerry cartoons
[2:36:08.880 --> 2:36:10.880]  and stuff but I'm already digressing
[2:36:10.880 --> 2:36:12.880]  and that part doesn't matter
[2:36:12.880 --> 2:36:14.880]  the point is is that
[2:36:14.880 --> 2:36:16.880]  the rabbit says please don't throw me in the briar patch
[2:36:16.880 --> 2:36:18.880]  when that's exactly where he wants to be thrown
[2:36:18.880 --> 2:36:20.880]  and so they have Bush come out
[2:36:20.880 --> 2:36:22.880]  and say it's all a bunch of bull and I'm not going to do it
[2:36:22.880 --> 2:36:24.880]  meanwhile he was funding it
[2:36:24.880 --> 2:36:26.880]  getting it ready funding federal programs
[2:36:26.880 --> 2:36:28.880]  preparing the public
[2:36:28.880 --> 2:36:30.880]  meanwhile he was covertly signed back on to UNESCO
[2:36:30.880 --> 2:36:32.880]  signed treaties to do it
[2:36:32.880 --> 2:36:34.880]  five years ago
[2:36:34.880 --> 2:36:36.880]  and we told you he's going to come out
[2:36:36.880 --> 2:36:38.880]  and endorse it which he did
[2:36:38.880 --> 2:36:40.880]  while they still say he's against it
[2:36:40.880 --> 2:36:42.880]  that way people that know
[2:36:42.880 --> 2:36:44.880]  George Bush is bad think oh my god
[2:36:44.880 --> 2:36:46.880]  this must be good
[2:36:46.880 --> 2:36:48.880]  I better get behind the global carbon tax
[2:36:48.880 --> 2:36:50.880]  and carbon trading
[2:36:50.880 --> 2:36:52.880]  and that's just one of many tricks
[2:36:52.880 --> 2:36:54.880]  they play on you one of the things
[2:36:54.880 --> 2:36:56.880]  they do
[2:36:56.880 --> 2:36:58.880]  and then same thing with
[2:36:58.880 --> 2:37:00.880]  you know they have Gary Aldrich
[2:37:00.880 --> 2:37:02.880]  come out and cover how
[2:37:04.880 --> 2:37:06.880]  George
[2:37:06.880 --> 2:37:08.880]  Bush is involving
[2:37:08.880 --> 2:37:10.880]  all this stuff today but that's okay
[2:37:10.880 --> 2:37:12.880]  because we saw what Bill Clinton did
[2:37:12.880 --> 2:37:14.880]  and
[2:37:14.880 --> 2:37:16.880]  Bill Clinton
[2:37:16.880 --> 2:37:18.880]  they did have crack pipes
[2:37:18.880 --> 2:37:20.880]  and dildos and
[2:37:20.880 --> 2:37:22.880]  linen pins in the White House
[2:37:22.880 --> 2:37:24.880]  on the first day but that was a sigh up
[2:37:26.880 --> 2:37:28.880]  Clinton and Hillary
[2:37:28.880 --> 2:37:30.880]  Bill and Hillary
[2:37:30.880 --> 2:37:32.880]  had been under
[2:37:32.880 --> 2:37:34.880]  cord mire
[2:37:34.880 --> 2:37:36.880]  the CIA section chief in London
[2:37:36.880 --> 2:37:38.880]  and had been sent to the Soviet Union
[2:37:38.880 --> 2:37:40.880]  and all these places in northern Italy
[2:37:40.880 --> 2:37:42.880]  to meet with the communists to infiltrate them
[2:37:42.880 --> 2:37:44.880]  and then to come back to England
[2:37:44.880 --> 2:37:46.880]  and give data that's why they were allowed back in
[2:37:46.880 --> 2:37:48.880]  and never got in trouble
[2:37:48.880 --> 2:37:50.880]  just like Lee Harvey Oswald and it's a fact
[2:37:50.880 --> 2:37:52.880]  Bill Clinton and Hillary were CIA
[2:37:52.880 --> 2:37:54.880]  from the time they met that's how they met
[2:37:54.880 --> 2:37:56.880]  but I'm digressing
[2:37:56.880 --> 2:37:58.880]  they did that as a sigh up to freak everybody out
[2:37:58.880 --> 2:38:00.880]  to play that communist angle
[2:38:00.880 --> 2:38:02.880]  I mean why would you wear
[2:38:02.880 --> 2:38:04.880]  VI linen pins
[2:38:04.880 --> 2:38:06.880]  into the White House on the first day of work
[2:38:06.880 --> 2:38:08.880]  which multiple witnesses on record
[2:38:08.880 --> 2:38:10.880]  they did why would you hang crack
[2:38:10.880 --> 2:38:12.880]  pipes from the Christmas tree
[2:38:14.880 --> 2:38:16.880]  it's meant to
[2:38:16.880 --> 2:38:18.880]  get out it's meant to freak people out
[2:38:18.880 --> 2:38:20.880]  it's a cover kind of like Eric
[2:38:20.880 --> 2:38:22.880]  Prince is supposedly a Calvinist
[2:38:22.880 --> 2:38:24.880]  and but now he's a Catholic and
[2:38:24.880 --> 2:38:26.880]  always this great man of the Lord runs
[2:38:26.880 --> 2:38:28.880]  blackwater that guy is as Christian
[2:38:28.880 --> 2:38:30.880]  as Satan
[2:38:30.880 --> 2:38:32.880]  it's all a cover
[2:38:32.880 --> 2:38:34.880]  and then you hear their Christians
[2:38:34.880 --> 2:38:36.880]  and then you think man Christians are evil
[2:38:36.880 --> 2:38:38.880]  look at Eric Prince look at George Bush
[2:38:38.880 --> 2:38:40.880]  he's born again
[2:38:40.880 --> 2:38:42.880]  meanwhile George Bush
[2:38:42.880 --> 2:38:44.880]  is involved in every type of organization
[2:38:44.880 --> 2:38:46.880]  known for their homosexual orgies
[2:38:46.880 --> 2:38:48.880]  Skull and Bones in Middle
[2:38:48.880 --> 2:38:50.880]  Bohemian Grove in Middle
[2:38:50.880 --> 2:38:52.880]  I mean I was inside there and was hit on
[2:38:52.880 --> 2:38:58.880]  within five minutes
[2:38:58.880 --> 2:39:00.880]  okay
[2:39:00.880 --> 2:39:02.880]  I had the workers in there
[2:39:02.880 --> 2:39:04.880]  laughing at me when nobody was around
[2:39:04.880 --> 2:39:06.880]  when I was trying to hide out in the woods
[2:39:10.880 --> 2:39:12.880]  the news admits they
[2:39:12.880 --> 2:39:14.880]  ship in gay prostitutes
[2:39:14.880 --> 2:39:16.880]  for them that's where George Bush
[2:39:16.880 --> 2:39:18.880]  and all them are by the way it kicked off today
[2:39:18.880 --> 2:39:20.880]  Barack Obama
[2:39:20.880 --> 2:39:22.880]  is scheduled to be there in the next two weeks
[2:39:22.880 --> 2:39:24.880]  with McCain it's all a big
[2:39:24.880 --> 2:39:26.880]  joke it's all completely
[2:39:26.880 --> 2:39:28.880]  and totally staged
[2:39:28.880 --> 2:39:30.880]  love him or hating
[2:39:30.880 --> 2:39:32.880]  the last guy that thought he was president
[2:39:32.880 --> 2:39:34.880]  got his head blown off then his brother
[2:39:34.880 --> 2:39:36.880]  thought he'd really gotten the nomination got his head blown off
[2:39:36.880 --> 2:39:38.880]  shot in the back of the head
[2:39:38.880 --> 2:39:40.880]  and four times in the back Bobby
[2:39:44.880 --> 2:39:46.880]  I want to explain something
[2:39:46.880 --> 2:39:48.880]  again to the police and military you think
[2:39:48.880 --> 2:39:50.880]  part of the establishment now most of you
[2:39:50.880 --> 2:39:52.880]  who were in the military who made fun of me
[2:39:52.880 --> 2:39:54.880]  six seven years ago you've now been to Iraq
[2:39:54.880 --> 2:39:56.880]  and Afghanistan they all come back
[2:39:56.880 --> 2:39:58.880]  and apologize they all
[2:39:58.880 --> 2:40:00.880]  who listen to this show come back and tune in
[2:40:00.880 --> 2:40:02.880]  and write me and call me and say my god
[2:40:02.880 --> 2:40:04.880]  you were right everything you said's true
[2:40:04.880 --> 2:40:06.880]  we're shipping in the opium they're kidnapping
[2:40:06.880 --> 2:40:08.880]  children of course I told
[2:40:08.880 --> 2:40:10.880]  you the truth we don't lie
[2:40:10.880 --> 2:40:12.880]  here folks
[2:40:12.880 --> 2:40:14.880]  and every day I realize
[2:40:14.880 --> 2:40:16.880]  I risked my life every day
[2:40:16.880 --> 2:40:18.880]  I go through all sorts of crap
[2:40:18.880 --> 2:40:20.880]  that I'll never even tell you about
[2:40:22.880 --> 2:40:24.880]  I put my family in danger because
[2:40:24.880 --> 2:40:26.880]  we can't let these people win
[2:40:26.880 --> 2:40:28.880]  it's more important what happens
[2:40:28.880 --> 2:40:30.880]  to our entire country and our entire civilization
[2:40:30.880 --> 2:40:32.880]  people made big sacrifices
[2:40:32.880 --> 2:40:34.880]  so we can have the liberty we've enjoyed
[2:40:34.880 --> 2:40:36.880]  and I'm not going to stand by
[2:40:36.880 --> 2:40:38.880]  and watch it all go to hell in a handbasket
[2:40:38.880 --> 2:40:40.880]  and I'm telling you out there listening
[2:40:40.880 --> 2:40:42.880]  you know in your gut
[2:40:42.880 --> 2:40:44.880]  and you've seen enough come true
[2:40:44.880 --> 2:40:46.880]  of what we've told you to know this stuff's real
[2:40:46.880 --> 2:40:48.880]  you think I exaggerate
[2:40:48.880 --> 2:40:50.880]  you think I embellish
[2:40:50.880 --> 2:40:52.880]  every day I get emails
[2:40:52.880 --> 2:40:54.880]  and message board comments
[2:40:54.880 --> 2:40:56.880]  because I scan through them an hour or so a day
[2:40:56.880 --> 2:40:58.880]  maybe longer a day Aaron's in there reading them right now
[2:40:58.880 --> 2:41:02.880]  you know that say things like
[2:41:02.880 --> 2:41:04.880]  England's not proposing
[2:41:04.880 --> 2:41:06.880]  to put microchips in all their prisoners
[2:41:06.880 --> 2:41:08.880]  and parolees
[2:41:08.880 --> 2:41:10.880]  doesn't matter if I've got BBC
[2:41:10.880 --> 2:41:12.880]  they just say it's not true
[2:41:12.880 --> 2:41:14.880]  or I can tell you 10 years ago
[2:41:14.880 --> 2:41:16.880]  that everybody at birth
[2:41:16.880 --> 2:41:18.880]  has their blood put in a database
[2:41:18.880 --> 2:41:20.880]  for 30 plus years
[2:41:20.880 --> 2:41:22.880]  now it's mainstream news
[2:41:22.880 --> 2:41:24.880]  people still don't believe it
[2:41:24.880 --> 2:41:26.880]  I can tell you there's cross species
[2:41:26.880 --> 2:41:28.880]  human animal hybrids
[2:41:28.880 --> 2:41:30.880]  hundreds of types
[2:41:30.880 --> 2:41:32.880]  people just don't believe it
[2:41:32.880 --> 2:41:34.880]  when it's a National Geographic
[2:41:34.880 --> 2:41:36.880]  Associated Press Reuters
[2:41:36.880 --> 2:41:38.880]  Times of London doesn't matter
[2:41:38.880 --> 2:41:40.880]  MIT doesn't matter
[2:41:42.880 --> 2:41:44.880]  I can tell you that auxiliary police
[2:41:44.880 --> 2:41:46.880]  in England have commended
[2:41:46.880 --> 2:41:48.880]  for watching people drown
[2:41:48.880 --> 2:41:50.880]  in rivers and not saving them
[2:41:50.880 --> 2:41:52.880]  saying that's not their job
[2:41:52.880 --> 2:41:54.880]  and I post the mainstream article
[2:41:54.880 --> 2:41:56.880]  and I say I'm lying and it's not true
[2:41:58.880 --> 2:42:00.880]  I mean look at these articles
[2:42:00.880 --> 2:42:02.880]  new law expands newborn screening
[2:42:02.880 --> 2:42:04.880]  a new law signed this month
[2:42:04.880 --> 2:42:06.880]  by Governor Edward G. Rendell
[2:42:06.880 --> 2:42:08.880]  will help to improve health
[2:42:08.880 --> 2:42:10.880]  of newborns in Pennsylvania
[2:42:10.880 --> 2:42:12.880]  according to state health department
[2:42:12.880 --> 2:42:14.880]  by amending the newborn child testing
[2:42:14.880 --> 2:42:16.880]  in act of 65 the new law enables
[2:42:16.880 --> 2:42:18.880]  the Department of Health to continue to provide for screening
[2:42:18.880 --> 2:42:20.880]  and follow up services for six mandated
[2:42:20.880 --> 2:42:22.880]  genetic and metabolic conditions
[2:42:22.880 --> 2:42:24.880]  babies born in Pennsylvania
[2:42:24.880 --> 2:42:26.880]  and it adds up to 22 services
[2:42:28.880 --> 2:42:30.880]  for genetic and metabolic conditions
[2:42:30.880 --> 2:42:32.880]  now they call it a service like the IRS is a service
[2:42:32.880 --> 2:42:34.880]  now we've had guests on
[2:42:34.880 --> 2:42:36.880]  we've covered the state laws on this
[2:42:36.880 --> 2:42:38.880]  the federal law now they take your blood
[2:42:38.880 --> 2:42:40.880]  and create a federal DNA database
[2:42:40.880 --> 2:42:42.880]  you're all in the DNA database now
[2:42:42.880 --> 2:42:44.880]  no judge, no jury, no indictment
[2:42:44.880 --> 2:42:46.880]  and then they also use it to patent
[2:42:46.880 --> 2:42:48.880]  your DNA to say that you don't own it
[2:42:48.880 --> 2:42:50.880]  so down the road when you want to get genetic
[2:42:50.880 --> 2:42:52.880]  cures and things
[2:42:52.880 --> 2:42:54.880]  they're going to say no
[2:42:54.880 --> 2:42:56.880]  and you've got to buy it from the companies
[2:42:56.880 --> 2:42:58.880]  that are purchasing it from the government
[2:42:58.880 --> 2:43:00.880]  that's all documented in this article basically
[2:43:00.880 --> 2:43:02.880]  it just introduces it to you
[2:43:02.880 --> 2:43:04.880]  it is out of the
[2:43:04.880 --> 2:43:06.880]  Gannett daily
[2:43:06.880 --> 2:43:08.880]  by amending the newborn child testing act
[2:43:08.880 --> 2:43:10.880]  this law helps further ensure
[2:43:10.880 --> 2:43:12.880]  see they were already doing this
[2:43:12.880 --> 2:43:14.880]  but now they're getting sued so they're passing laws
[2:43:14.880 --> 2:43:16.880]  kind of like they violate the Fourth Amendment so they pass a law
[2:43:16.880 --> 2:43:18.880]  retroactively saying they can commit felonies
[2:43:18.880 --> 2:43:20.880]  the law helps further ensure
[2:43:20.880 --> 2:43:22.880]  that newborns receive
[2:43:22.880 --> 2:43:24.880]  necessary follow-up services
[2:43:24.880 --> 2:43:26.880]  that means they're going to come take more blood
[2:43:26.880 --> 2:43:28.880]  so they can lead happy, healthy lives
[2:43:28.880 --> 2:43:30.880]  you can't
[2:43:30.880 --> 2:43:32.880]  secretary of health Dr. Calvin B. Johnson said
[2:43:32.880 --> 2:43:34.880]  early intervention
[2:43:34.880 --> 2:43:36.880]  and treatment is vital to a baby's health
[2:43:36.880 --> 2:43:38.880]  and provides peace of mind
[2:43:38.880 --> 2:43:40.880]  for parents that means they're going to
[2:43:40.880 --> 2:43:42.880]  force genetic quote treatments on you
[2:43:42.880 --> 2:43:44.880]  even though quote diseases they claim
[2:43:44.880 --> 2:43:46.880]  they found haven't manifest
[2:43:46.880 --> 2:43:48.880]  the department of
[2:43:48.880 --> 2:43:50.880]  health refers newborns
[2:43:50.880 --> 2:43:52.880]  screen positive for metabolic and genetic disorders
[2:43:52.880 --> 2:43:54.880]  and specialized treatment centers
[2:43:54.880 --> 2:43:56.880]  just like they can kill you with drugs
[2:43:56.880 --> 2:43:58.880]  for confirming testing
[2:43:58.880 --> 2:44:00.880]  see confirming testing because
[2:44:00.880 --> 2:44:02.880]  one of the things they test for is a false positive
[2:44:02.880 --> 2:44:04.880]  one third of the time
[2:44:04.880 --> 2:44:06.880]  doesn't matter you don't treat your kid under that
[2:44:06.880 --> 2:44:08.880]  they swat team you so fast it makes your head spin
[2:44:08.880 --> 2:44:10.880]  and the cops will take their kids to be killed too
[2:44:10.880 --> 2:44:12.880]  to be tested on and drugged out
[2:44:12.880 --> 2:44:14.880]  just like the cops in New Orleans sat there while their mothers
[2:44:14.880 --> 2:44:16.880]  and fathers and family died waiting
[2:44:16.880 --> 2:44:18.880]  five days following federal orders
[2:44:18.880 --> 2:44:20.880]  they follow their orders under death with pleasure
[2:44:20.880 --> 2:44:22.880]  and you better believe it
[2:44:22.880 --> 2:44:24.880]  hell force
[2:44:24.880 --> 2:44:26.880]  trained to let their own families die
[2:44:26.880 --> 2:44:28.880]  diagnosis treatment
[2:44:28.880 --> 2:44:30.880]  and parental education
[2:44:30.880 --> 2:44:32.880]  all the 28 metabolic genetic disorders are uncommon
[2:44:32.880 --> 2:44:34.880]  their presence may lead to mental retardation
[2:44:34.880 --> 2:44:36.880]  even death of not properly diagnosed
[2:44:36.880 --> 2:44:38.880]  so we're exposing the fact that it's a big
[2:44:38.880 --> 2:44:40.880]  DNA database you don't believe me
[2:44:40.880 --> 2:44:42.880]  just go google the newborn
[2:44:42.880 --> 2:44:44.880]  child testing act
[2:44:44.880 --> 2:44:46.880]  and then just look at all the universities and government
[2:44:46.880 --> 2:44:48.880]  agencies where they admit they own your blood
[2:44:48.880 --> 2:44:50.880]  they're creating DNA databases
[2:44:50.880 --> 2:44:52.880]  with homeland security all of it
[2:44:52.880 --> 2:44:54.880]  and then read this stupid article written for the cattle
[2:44:56.880 --> 2:44:58.880]  more of your calls come up in a minute
[2:44:58.880 --> 2:45:00.880]  but I want to
[2:45:00.880 --> 2:45:02.880]  I wanted to get through the financial news
[2:45:02.880 --> 2:45:04.880]  and cover something that wasn't the financial news
[2:45:06.880 --> 2:45:08.880]  where is it here
[2:45:08.880 --> 2:45:10.880]  I know that's torturing children
[2:45:10.880 --> 2:45:12.880]  Salt Lake City Tribune
[2:45:12.880 --> 2:45:14.880]  and
[2:45:14.880 --> 2:45:16.880]  no where's my story
[2:45:16.880 --> 2:45:18.880]  oh here it is this is out of NBC WSMV
[2:45:18.880 --> 2:45:20.880]  Memphis police
[2:45:20.880 --> 2:45:22.880]  to use amnesia like injection of
[2:45:22.880 --> 2:45:24.880]  lieu of taser
[2:45:24.880 --> 2:45:26.880]  and the new thing they do
[2:45:26.880 --> 2:45:28.880]  at airports
[2:45:28.880 --> 2:45:30.880]  is they're injecting people and they're doing this all over
[2:45:30.880 --> 2:45:32.880]  meanwhile the metro police
[2:45:32.880 --> 2:45:34.880]  while the metro police have
[2:45:34.880 --> 2:45:36.880]  banned the use of tasers for a time
[2:45:36.880 --> 2:45:38.880]  they had a bunch of people die
[2:45:38.880 --> 2:45:40.880]  in Nashville
[2:45:40.880 --> 2:45:42.880]  all was it two in one day one time
[2:45:42.880 --> 2:45:44.880]  used a controversial method to subdue an early people
[2:45:44.880 --> 2:45:46.880]  according to an I team report
[2:45:46.880 --> 2:45:48.880]  related links contact the I team
[2:45:48.880 --> 2:45:50.880]  it says that the city's policy to use the method
[2:45:50.880 --> 2:45:52.880]  which calls for the injection of a drug into the person
[2:45:52.880 --> 2:45:54.880]  came as a total surprise to people
[2:45:54.880 --> 2:45:56.880]  who would expect
[2:45:56.880 --> 2:45:58.880]  to know all about it
[2:45:58.880 --> 2:46:00.880]  for almost two years metro police
[2:46:00.880 --> 2:46:02.880]  had the option of calling for a needle loaded
[2:46:02.880 --> 2:46:04.880]  with a strong sedative to control the most
[2:46:04.880 --> 2:46:06.880]  people they encounter on the street
[2:46:06.880 --> 2:46:08.880]  one of the doctors who came up with the protocol said
[2:46:08.880 --> 2:46:10.880]  it's the safest option out of
[2:46:10.880 --> 2:46:12.880]  out there
[2:46:12.880 --> 2:46:14.880]  and that it is used all over the country
[2:46:16.880 --> 2:46:18.880]  and it's an amnesia drug
[2:46:18.880 --> 2:46:20.880]  using mind control
[2:46:20.880 --> 2:46:22.880]  the drug has an amnesia effect and we use
[2:46:22.880 --> 2:46:24.880]  the
[2:46:24.880 --> 2:46:26.880]  because one of the nice ways
[2:46:26.880 --> 2:46:28.880]  to take care of the discomfort is to
[2:46:28.880 --> 2:46:30.880]  make people forget that they've had it
[2:46:30.880 --> 2:46:32.880]  and biomedical ethics
[2:46:32.880 --> 2:46:34.880]  and law enforcement
[2:46:34.880 --> 2:46:36.880]  expert Steven Mills so that's what's dangerous
[2:46:36.880 --> 2:46:38.880]  is that it
[2:46:38.880 --> 2:46:40.880]  is an amnesia
[2:46:40.880 --> 2:46:42.880]  now they give this to troops too now
[2:46:42.880 --> 2:46:44.880]  and the troops of course don't know about it because they don't remember it
[2:46:44.880 --> 2:46:46.880]  this sounds reasonable
[2:46:46.880 --> 2:46:48.880]  it's better than having your head beat in with a billy club
[2:46:48.880 --> 2:46:50.880]  and that's why they tell the cops they say look
[2:46:50.880 --> 2:46:52.880]  tasers are killing people we don't know about them now
[2:46:52.880 --> 2:46:54.880]  we want you to start using these
[2:46:54.880 --> 2:46:56.880]  injectors they even got guns that shoot them
[2:46:56.880 --> 2:46:58.880]  like you're an elephant or something
[2:46:58.880 --> 2:47:00.880]  and
[2:47:00.880 --> 2:47:02.880]  if it goes in an artery it can kill you it's been to go into the muscle
[2:47:02.880 --> 2:47:04.880]  and
[2:47:04.880 --> 2:47:06.880]  they're saying
[2:47:06.880 --> 2:47:08.880]  you know we gotta do this
[2:47:08.880 --> 2:47:10.880]  and it would be reasonable if the system wasn't so corrupt
[2:47:10.880 --> 2:47:12.880]  the problem is it sets the precedent
[2:47:12.880 --> 2:47:14.880]  all over the country for at least a decade
[2:47:14.880 --> 2:47:16.880]  thousands of people
[2:47:16.880 --> 2:47:18.880]  have never seen a judge a jury anything
[2:47:18.880 --> 2:47:20.880]  a lot of them are prominent
[2:47:20.880 --> 2:47:22.880]  Charles T. Sell the famous case of the dentist
[2:47:22.880 --> 2:47:24.880]  now ten years in solitary confinement awaiting trial
[2:47:24.880 --> 2:47:26.880]  he's a zombie
[2:47:26.880 --> 2:47:28.880]  giving him anti-psychotic drugs just because
[2:47:28.880 --> 2:47:30.880]  he was selling the government
[2:47:30.880 --> 2:47:32.880]  so that's why it's dangerous to have them doing this
[2:47:32.880 --> 2:47:34.880]  but you're gonna see more of that
[2:47:34.880 --> 2:47:36.880]  and they're gonna sell it and make it sound reasonable
[2:47:36.880 --> 2:47:38.880]  okay who's next here
[2:47:38.880 --> 2:47:40.880]  Lynn and Chicago
[2:47:40.880 --> 2:47:42.880]  Lynn and Chicago you're on the air
[2:47:42.880 --> 2:47:44.880]  hi Alex I love you thank you
[2:47:44.880 --> 2:47:46.880]  for all your hard work got a couple comments
[2:47:46.880 --> 2:47:48.880]  and then a solution
[2:47:48.880 --> 2:47:50.880]  I think
[2:47:50.880 --> 2:47:52.880]  first of all
[2:47:52.880 --> 2:47:54.880]  the revolutionary army that fought against the British
[2:47:54.880 --> 2:47:56.880]  I mean these men fought
[2:47:56.880 --> 2:47:58.880]  the snow they fought in the cold
[2:47:58.880 --> 2:48:00.880]  they fought in the rain they fought in the heat
[2:48:00.880 --> 2:48:02.880]  they fought when they were hungry they died for us
[2:48:02.880 --> 2:48:04.880]  I mean
[2:48:04.880 --> 2:48:06.880]  our founding fathers left us
[2:48:06.880 --> 2:48:08.880]  the
[2:48:08.880 --> 2:48:10.880]  privilege of overturning
[2:48:10.880 --> 2:48:12.880]  a rogue government
[2:48:12.880 --> 2:48:14.880]  and here's my solution
[2:48:14.880 --> 2:48:16.880]  you know
[2:48:16.880 --> 2:48:18.880]  the gentleman below
[2:48:18.880 --> 2:48:20.880]  sorry I forgot his name
[2:48:20.880 --> 2:48:22.880]  the gentleman that wrote the book of the prosecution of Bush
[2:48:22.880 --> 2:48:24.880]  you know it seems to me
[2:48:24.880 --> 2:48:26.880]  Boogliosi
[2:48:26.880 --> 2:48:28.880]  yeah Boogliosi thank you very much
[2:48:28.880 --> 2:48:30.880]  I couldn't remember his name
[2:48:30.880 --> 2:48:32.880]  it seems like we need an army of prosecutors
[2:48:32.880 --> 2:48:34.880]  I mean it seems like we need
[2:48:34.880 --> 2:48:36.880]  those are the people that really need to fight this battle
[2:48:36.880 --> 2:48:38.880]  for us in the courtrooms
[2:48:38.880 --> 2:48:40.880]  and if we can get grand juries to
[2:48:40.880 --> 2:48:42.880]  indict
[2:48:42.880 --> 2:48:44.880]  the Clintons, the Bushes, the Chenees, the Rockefellers
[2:48:44.880 --> 2:48:46.880]  the Minions and go into Congress
[2:48:46.880 --> 2:48:48.880]  with handcuffs
[2:48:48.880 --> 2:48:50.880]  with police officers
[2:48:50.880 --> 2:48:52.880]  and start arresting these people
[2:48:52.880 --> 2:48:54.880]  what are they doing
[2:48:54.880 --> 2:48:56.880]  I think the whole
[2:48:56.880 --> 2:48:58.880]  house of cards would fall apart
[2:48:58.880 --> 2:49:00.880]  can you imagine
[2:49:00.880 --> 2:49:02.880]  if we got all the documents of how they carried the attacks out
[2:49:02.880 --> 2:49:04.880]  if you can imagine getting all the total information
[2:49:04.880 --> 2:49:06.880]  awareness documents about how they're surveilling
[2:49:06.880 --> 2:49:08.880]  everything I mean they admit they are
[2:49:08.880 --> 2:49:10.880]  but imagine having all the battle planning
[2:49:10.880 --> 2:49:12.880]  imagine the world seeing that
[2:49:12.880 --> 2:49:14.880]  an outlawing it forever
[2:49:14.880 --> 2:49:16.880]  but can't we like have grand juries
[2:49:16.880 --> 2:49:18.880]  all over the nation
[2:49:18.880 --> 2:49:20.880]  can't we have prosecutors going in
[2:49:20.880 --> 2:49:22.880]  grand juries to have indictments
[2:49:22.880 --> 2:49:24.880]  yes I didn't know that
[2:49:24.880 --> 2:49:26.880]  Red Beckman was still giving speeches
[2:49:26.880 --> 2:49:28.880]  but I found out he gave a speech last week
[2:49:28.880 --> 2:49:30.880]  I know he's been very ill
[2:49:30.880 --> 2:49:32.880]  last time I heard his wife was in really bad shape
[2:49:32.880 --> 2:49:34.880]  but I'm going to get Red Beckman
[2:49:34.880 --> 2:49:36.880]  who founded the fully informed jury association
[2:49:36.880 --> 2:49:38.880]  expert on grand juries
[2:49:38.880 --> 2:49:40.880]  and how to do this on
[2:49:40.880 --> 2:49:42.880]  we're going to get Red Beckman on for you
[2:49:42.880 --> 2:49:44.880]  yeah because you know what
[2:49:44.880 --> 2:49:46.880]  honestly at times running out
[2:49:46.880 --> 2:49:48.880]  I don't know if you're going to be able to get that cable show on
[2:49:48.880 --> 2:49:50.880]  and I'm not it's like two minutes
[2:49:50.880 --> 2:49:52.880]  to midnight they're going to I believe
[2:49:52.880 --> 2:49:54.880]  they're going to cut the cords on you as soon as you get it
[2:49:54.880 --> 2:49:56.880]  up and I'm just thinking
[2:49:56.880 --> 2:49:58.880]  that maybe we should
[2:49:58.880 --> 2:50:00.880]  we should be you know maybe you should be
[2:50:00.880 --> 2:50:02.880]  putting together some kind of
[2:50:02.880 --> 2:50:04.880]  bringing
[2:50:04.880 --> 2:50:06.880]  an interns from
[2:50:06.880 --> 2:50:08.880]  from a university
[2:50:08.880 --> 2:50:10.880]  that study law that study the constitution
[2:50:10.880 --> 2:50:12.880]  and there should be a fight out there
[2:50:12.880 --> 2:50:14.880]  well ma'am we could have a thousand
[2:50:14.880 --> 2:50:16.880]  and I appreciate your call we could have
[2:50:16.880 --> 2:50:18.880]  a thousand people and we couldn't scratch the surface
[2:50:18.880 --> 2:50:20.880]  it's you taking action
[2:50:20.880 --> 2:50:22.880]  not me okay look in
[2:50:22.880 --> 2:50:24.880]  the mirror that's the only solution
[2:50:24.880 --> 2:50:26.880]  as for raising two hundred two thousand
[2:50:26.880 --> 2:50:28.880]  dollars that's our operating
[2:50:28.880 --> 2:50:30.880]  expense in three months you know how much
[2:50:30.880 --> 2:50:32.880]  we spend around here for everything
[2:50:32.880 --> 2:50:34.880]  and I'm going to do the TV
[2:50:34.880 --> 2:50:36.880]  thing because I said I was going to do it and when that's
[2:50:36.880 --> 2:50:38.880]  moving along nicely
[2:50:38.880 --> 2:50:40.880]  but it doesn't mean it's the end all be all
[2:50:40.880 --> 2:50:42.880]  silver bullet we all do what we
[2:50:42.880 --> 2:50:46.880]  can okay
[2:50:46.880 --> 2:50:48.880]  may I have everybody's attention please

[2:51:04.880 --> 2:51:06.880]  for
[2:51:06.880 --> 2:51:08.880]  the day that we stop asking questions
[2:51:08.880 --> 2:51:10.880]  is the day that we have
[2:51:10.880 --> 2:51:12.880]  allowed the seeds of despotism to grow
[2:51:12.880 --> 2:51:14.880]  at our own door seven years
[2:51:14.880 --> 2:51:16.880]  after the attacks of September 11
[2:51:16.880 --> 2:51:18.880]  a global awakening has taken place
[2:51:18.880 --> 2:51:20.880]  an inside job

[2:53:44.880 --> 2:53:46.880]  www.OrderFreeTV.com
[2:54:33.880 --> 2:54:41.880]  Yeah, the Department of Defense has released a declassified document
[2:54:41.880 --> 2:54:47.880]  admitting that the heads of the House of Senate Intelligence Committee, the White House,
[2:54:47.880 --> 2:54:54.880]  all met with al-Qaeda chiefs the week of 9-11 through the week after.
[2:54:54.880 --> 2:54:57.880]  That's up on Info Wars and Prison Planet.
[2:54:57.880 --> 2:55:00.880]  We always told you General Mutamed and the rest of them met
[2:55:00.880 --> 2:55:04.880]  whether they were funding Muhammadat and the rest of them in a U.S. black op.
[2:55:04.880 --> 2:55:09.880]  But that's all out now for you and, you know, it's just how it is.
[2:55:09.880 --> 2:55:13.880]  Okay, well, let's take another call here.
[2:55:13.880 --> 2:55:17.880]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ben in North Carolina, then to Moss, Scott, and others.
[2:55:17.880 --> 2:55:18.880]  Go ahead, Ben.
[2:55:18.880 --> 2:55:20.880]  Hey, Alex. Thanks for taking my call.
[2:55:20.880 --> 2:55:24.880]  I just wanted to let you know that I'm currently a college student,
[2:55:24.880 --> 2:55:30.880]  so everything that you talk about in regards to disinformation regarding the left-right paradigm
[2:55:30.880 --> 2:55:37.880]  and even economics is just absolutely out of control in the university environment today.
[2:55:37.880 --> 2:55:41.880]  Yeah, going to university is paying hundreds of thousands of dollars
[2:55:41.880 --> 2:55:48.880]  to be fed a complete line of propaganda and lies and disinfo just to get to the engineering.
[2:55:48.880 --> 2:55:51.880]  But only if you're in the sciences do you need any college.
[2:55:51.880 --> 2:55:54.880]  It is totally and completely a worthless joke.
[2:55:54.880 --> 2:55:58.880]  Well, I've experienced, I mean, several economics classes.
[2:55:58.880 --> 2:56:03.880]  I consider myself to be somewhat of an amateur scholar of the Austrian School of Economics,
[2:56:03.880 --> 2:56:09.880]  and, you know, I'll routinely go in there quoting books by Murray Rothbard on the gold standard
[2:56:09.880 --> 2:56:12.880]  and hard money mentioning Ron Paul, things like that.
[2:56:12.880 --> 2:56:16.880]  And I'm literally laughed at by the professors.
[2:56:16.880 --> 2:56:21.880]  The classroom have even been told, you know, that's an archaic system.
[2:56:21.880 --> 2:56:26.880]  Hey, listen, listen, listen, those professors barely know how to deposit their paycheck.
[2:56:26.880 --> 2:56:29.880]  They're losers that don't know anything.
[2:56:29.880 --> 2:56:31.880]  They're low-grade morons.
[2:56:31.880 --> 2:56:36.880]  They don't understand that the fiat currency has destroyed our growth, destroyed our future,
[2:56:36.880 --> 2:56:39.880]  and you're not going to help them.
[2:56:39.880 --> 2:56:41.880]  They're there because they're losers.
[2:56:41.880 --> 2:56:43.880]  One question for you, and I'll let you go out.
[2:56:43.880 --> 2:56:48.880]  If you could elaborate a little bit about the UCC, the Uniform Commercial Code.
[2:56:48.880 --> 2:56:53.880]  I've heard it mentioned in movies like Esoteric Agenda, and I've done some research.
[2:56:53.880 --> 2:56:59.880]  FDRF.org has some information on it, but I'm not too privy about it.
[2:56:59.880 --> 2:57:03.880]  So if you could just talk a little bit about that, that'd be great.
[2:57:03.880 --> 2:57:07.880]  You know, I'd rather get somebody like Ralph Winterwood up about that
[2:57:07.880 --> 2:57:11.880]  because there's a lot of disinfo surrounding the U.S. Code,
[2:57:11.880 --> 2:57:16.880]  but that's the rules for the private mercenary agencies or letters of mark
[2:57:16.880 --> 2:57:18.880]  as they're seen in mercantile commerce.
[2:57:18.880 --> 2:57:22.880]  And then there's a lot of disinfo attached to a lot of dangerous disinfo.
[2:57:22.880 --> 2:57:25.880]  You just better watch out a lot of the Patriot groups out there.
[2:57:25.880 --> 2:57:27.880]  I'm not singling out who you mentioned.
[2:57:27.880 --> 2:57:29.880]  That's very dangerous stuff.
[2:57:29.880 --> 2:57:31.880]  Look, the government is lawless.
[2:57:31.880 --> 2:57:33.880]  It is force majeure, forced majeure.
[2:57:33.880 --> 2:57:36.880]  It is the law of the gun shoved in your mouth.
[2:57:36.880 --> 2:57:37.880]  Okay.
[2:57:37.880 --> 2:57:40.880]  I mean, the stock market openly launders drug money.
[2:57:40.880 --> 2:57:44.880]  They openly send Richard Grasso to deal, you know, drugs.
[2:57:44.880 --> 2:57:46.880]  They openly have drug money.
[2:57:46.880 --> 2:57:48.880]  They openly scam.
[2:57:48.880 --> 2:57:53.880]  McCain openly goes to Columbia and England and takes illegal campaign contributions
[2:57:53.880 --> 2:57:55.880]  from foreigners and just laughs.
[2:57:55.880 --> 2:57:57.880]  Lawless, evilness everywhere.
[2:57:57.880 --> 2:57:59.880]  Laughing.
[2:57:59.880 --> 2:58:03.880]  You know, politicians sitting there getting, you know,
[2:58:03.880 --> 2:58:06.880]  with their minions soliciting hundreds of thousands of dollars
[2:58:06.880 --> 2:58:10.880]  to even meet with Connolly Saris and CNN says it's not illegal.
[2:58:10.880 --> 2:58:14.880]  Just wanton criminality everywhere for foaming at the mouth.
[2:58:14.880 --> 2:58:16.880]  Just, just, the criminals know it's all going down.
[2:58:16.880 --> 2:58:20.880]  So they're just grabbing and snatching and greedily buying islands offshore
[2:58:20.880 --> 2:58:25.880]  and fleeing as fast as they can while the public runs around foaming at the mouth.

[2:59:34.880 --> 3:00:02.880]  Join the info war today.
[3:00:02.880 --> 3:00:08.880]  Jesse Ventura decided to not run for the Senate.
[3:00:08.880 --> 3:00:12.880]  Out of Minnesota we had begged him to do so many others had asked him to
[3:00:12.880 --> 3:00:16.880]  but he has a handicapped daughter.
[3:00:16.880 --> 3:00:22.880]  So he told Larry King live he doesn't really believe the American people want somebody to fight.
[3:00:22.880 --> 3:00:24.880]  He thinks we want slavery.
[3:00:24.880 --> 3:00:26.880]  That's what he described yesterday.
[3:00:26.880 --> 3:00:30.880]  And he did say that he believes the government staged the attacks.
[3:00:30.880 --> 3:00:34.880]  He went further yesterday saying he thinks they may stage more attacks
[3:00:34.880 --> 3:00:38.880]  and we have to commend his bravery.
[3:00:38.880 --> 3:00:40.880]  He's already run. He's already been a governor.
[3:00:40.880 --> 3:00:46.880]  He already has had them attack his children and he has now decided to evacuate the United States.
[3:00:46.880 --> 3:00:50.880]  So he is evacuated. He is evacuating the next few months.
[3:00:50.880 --> 3:00:54.880]  He's basically going to leave and mainly stay in Mexico
[3:00:54.880 --> 3:00:58.880]  and I guess watch our collapse from there as then Mexico is drugging to the black hole
[3:00:58.880 --> 3:01:02.880]  but he lives an hour away from electricity in the jungle.
[3:01:02.880 --> 3:01:06.880]  Sounds like absolute heaven. I can barely control myself not evacuating immediately.
[3:01:06.880 --> 3:01:12.880]  But you know what? I am committed ladies and gentlemen and I am sworn to stay here.
[3:01:12.880 --> 3:01:18.880]  That doesn't mean I won't evacuate my family though.
[3:01:18.880 --> 3:01:22.880]  I mean if I see him do the preparations for mass roundups because he'll condition you first
[3:01:22.880 --> 3:01:27.880]  I'll probably evacuate my family and I'll announce I've evacuated him so others can evacuate.
[3:01:27.880 --> 3:01:31.880]  You know I think you deserve that advice if you
[3:01:31.880 --> 3:01:35.880]  at least the opportunity to have my advice because
[3:01:35.880 --> 3:01:39.880]  the people of America are demonic pig monsters
[3:01:39.880 --> 3:01:43.880]  on average and if there's a mass of depression they will turn into
[3:01:43.880 --> 3:01:47.880]  demons. They will do whatever they're told
[3:01:47.880 --> 3:01:51.880]  by the establishment for cheeseburgers and liquor and to be told they're powerful and cool
[3:01:51.880 --> 3:01:55.880]  and to be given shiny baubles like any bird
[3:01:55.880 --> 3:01:59.880]  you know any bird brain would want to put in their nest.
[3:01:59.880 --> 3:02:03.880]  So that basically is what's happening
[3:02:03.880 --> 3:02:07.880]  and the new old order wants to fully rape everyone
[3:02:07.880 --> 3:02:11.880]  and I don't blame him for evacuating. He says he'd be alone
[3:02:11.880 --> 3:02:15.880]  up there and he also knows they kill senators. They blow up their planes all the time
[3:02:15.880 --> 3:02:19.880]  they kill them all the time. I've seen the statistics are thousands
[3:02:19.880 --> 3:02:23.880]  of times more likely to be killed in an aircraft if you're a senator
[3:02:23.880 --> 3:02:27.880]  or a congressman than if you are just a citizen. Even citizens
[3:02:27.880 --> 3:02:31.880]  that fly as much. They're thousands of times. So people are criticizing
[3:02:31.880 --> 3:02:35.880]  Ventura right now. Have you done as much as Ventura has done?
[3:02:35.880 --> 3:02:39.880]  I mean you know he told us at the end. I was thinking he'd
[3:02:39.880 --> 3:02:43.880]  run. I was trying to push him. At the end of the interview he said
[3:02:43.880 --> 3:02:47.880]  alright Alex I'll come back on your show before I go back down to Mexico. And I walked out during
[3:02:47.880 --> 3:02:51.880]  the break and I said oh you hear that Burmese? And he said absolutely
[3:02:51.880 --> 3:02:55.880]  he's going to Mexico. He's going to announce he's not running tonight. I came back on air.
[3:02:55.880 --> 3:02:59.880]  In fact let's cue that up. He left us at 105.
[3:02:59.880 --> 3:03:03.880]  I want to play that at the end of the show just the last minute with Ventura.
[3:03:03.880 --> 3:03:07.880]  Oh you're ready with it right now? Let's go ahead and play that right now.
[3:03:07.880 --> 3:03:11.880]  Here it is. Thank you Alex. It's always my pleasure and I look forward to
[3:03:11.880 --> 3:03:15.880]  doing it again before I head to Mexico. Thank you. We'll talk to you soon sir.
[3:03:15.880 --> 3:03:19.880]  Very good. Bye bye.
[3:03:19.880 --> 3:03:25.880]  Oh that's too bad isn't it? I mean he told you right there.
[3:03:25.880 --> 3:03:29.880]  You heard it here first before Larry King live.
[3:03:29.880 --> 3:03:33.880]  And you know I've just got admired Jesse Ventura and Charlie Sheen and the German
[3:03:33.880 --> 3:03:37.880]  Defense Minister and the Italian President and one of the leaders of the diet
[3:03:37.880 --> 3:03:41.880]  one of the leaders of his party in Japan. And Bill Christensen
[3:03:41.880 --> 3:03:45.880]  former CIA section chief in Berlin coming out on my show saying it is
[3:03:45.880 --> 3:03:49.880]  an inside job and Ray McGovern, White House Breaker, Ronald Reagan, George Bush
[3:03:49.880 --> 3:03:53.880]  Senior and the thousands of others. Kevin Ryan lost
[3:03:53.880 --> 3:03:57.880]  his hundred and something thousand dollar year in
[3:03:57.880 --> 3:04:01.880]  engineer job at underwriting laboratories. He saw their secret
[3:04:01.880 --> 3:04:05.880]  report that the building had to be blown up the towers and he said my god you did
[3:04:05.880 --> 3:04:09.880]  internal tests and you know this was blown up and they said shut up
[3:04:09.880 --> 3:04:13.880]  we're not going to tell people and he came out and released the report and said they blew it up
[3:04:13.880 --> 3:04:17.880]  and now they've narrowed it into who did it.
[3:04:17.880 --> 3:04:21.880]  God Almighty, God's giving us a chance to see
[3:04:21.880 --> 3:04:25.880]  the truth and fight against this. I mean it's now been declassified
[3:04:25.880 --> 3:04:29.880]  at top al-Qaeda leaders meeting with the White House and the
[3:04:29.880 --> 3:04:33.880]  Congress and the week before and the week of 9-11 you got Bush meeting with the head of the
[3:04:33.880 --> 3:04:37.880]  Carlisle group with the head of the bin Laden family in al-Qaeda meetings as well.
[3:04:37.880 --> 3:04:41.880]  God Almighty, these people are sick.
[3:04:41.880 --> 3:04:45.880]  Sick. Sick.
[3:04:45.880 --> 3:04:49.880]  Gas prices are out of control. Fight back by doing what thousands of
[3:04:49.880 --> 3:04:53.880]  listeners to the Alex Jones show have done. Developed by a major oil company,
[3:04:53.880 --> 3:04:57.880]  a product that really works. Introducing SFR's Protecta Complete Fuel System
[3:04:57.880 --> 3:05:01.880]  and Engine Treatment. Just one bottle increases mileage for up to six months.
[3:05:01.880 --> 3:05:05.880]  Fleet tested by major oil company showing improvements in every car tested.
[3:05:05.880 --> 3:05:09.880]  Stop paying mechanics your hard earned money to have your injection system cleaned.
[3:05:09.880 --> 3:05:13.880]  It's up to 95% of new injector condition in just one tank full and it's
[3:05:13.880 --> 3:05:17.880]  safe for all cars. Test conducted by General Motors conclude fuel injectors
[3:05:17.880 --> 3:05:21.880]  can partially plug in as little as 5,000 miles due to poor gasoline quality.
[3:05:21.880 --> 3:05:25.880]  Fight high fuel prices by purchasing a Protecta Fuel System treatment
[3:05:25.880 --> 3:05:29.880]  for only $9.95 and receive an engine treatment free a $12.95
[3:05:29.880 --> 3:05:33.880]  value. Satisfaction guaranteed or your money back go to oilcompanysecret.com

[3:05:41.880 --> 3:05:45.880]  Once America was led by real politicians
[3:05:45.880 --> 3:05:49.880]  now politicians in the US, city, county, state and federal
[3:05:49.880 --> 3:05:53.880]  are owned and controlled by corporations. We have corporate representatives
[3:05:53.880 --> 3:05:57.880]  instead of politicians. Criminal corporate manipulation has caused
[3:05:57.880 --> 3:06:01.880]  grain prices to soar to the highest levels in history. Shortages of rice, corn
[3:06:01.880 --> 3:06:05.880]  and wheat now exist in most countries. Natural disasters have put millions
[3:06:05.880 --> 3:06:09.880]  worldwide at risk of starvation. Food riots and bread lines occurred
[3:06:09.880 --> 3:06:13.880]  daily in 30 nations and not only is that list growing but it's headed this way.
[3:06:13.880 --> 3:06:17.880]  Survival enterprises are massive distributors of the highest quality long term storage foods.
[3:06:17.880 --> 3:06:21.880]  Mountain house freeze dried foods, canned beef, chicken, turkey, butter, bacon, spices, cheese,
[3:06:21.880 --> 3:06:25.880]  fruit and more. We have tons of food in stock now. Call 1-800-753-1981

[3:06:41.880 --> 3:06:45.880]  On September 11th,
[3:06:45.880 --> 3:06:49.880]  2001 along with hundreds of my fellow troops I went
[3:06:49.880 --> 3:06:53.880]  to grounds here and we knew what to do or at least we thought we did.
[3:06:53.880 --> 3:06:57.880]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives
[3:06:57.880 --> 3:07:01.880]  first responders a platform to tell their story.
[3:07:01.880 --> 3:07:05.880]  EPA director on the 18th made
[3:07:05.880 --> 3:07:09.880]  a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[3:07:09.880 --> 3:07:13.880]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls
[3:07:13.880 --> 3:07:17.880]  throughout the world take action against their global masters. He had his
[3:07:17.880 --> 3:07:21.880]  hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown. He takes his hand off and you hear
[3:07:21.880 --> 3:07:25.880]  3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[3:07:25.880 --> 3:07:29.880]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide. Download
[3:07:29.880 --> 3:07:33.880]  Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively
[3:07:33.880 --> 3:07:37.880]  spread it worldwide or order the dvd at infowars.com
[3:07:37.880 --> 3:07:41.880]  If we don't expose the government sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts
[3:07:41.880 --> 3:07:45.880]  and bring in martial law.
[3:07:45.880 --> 3:07:49.880]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines
[3:07:49.880 --> 3:07:53.880]  the information war continues. It's Alex Jones
[3:07:53.880 --> 3:07:57.880]  and the GCN radio network.
[3:07:57.880 --> 3:08:01.880]  I know that we have a lot of phone calls in the wings at the bottom of
[3:08:01.880 --> 3:08:05.880]  the hour. I promise we'll get to your phone calls.
[3:08:05.880 --> 3:08:09.880]  Dr. Stan Montee Ford decade upon decade upon decade
[3:08:09.880 --> 3:08:13.880]  has been exposing
[3:08:13.880 --> 3:08:17.880]  how they've engineered the AIDS virus, how they carry out chemical biological attacks.
[3:08:17.880 --> 3:08:21.880]  He is a medical doctor, MD
[3:08:21.880 --> 3:08:25.880]  also a surgeon, orthopedic surgeon and he's written quite a few books
[3:08:25.880 --> 3:08:29.880]  The Brotherhood of Darkness. He has all the source documents. He's very
[3:08:29.880 --> 3:08:33.880]  neurotic and that's good about having all his documentation in a row.
[3:08:33.880 --> 3:08:37.880]  And I wanted to have him on about the global population reduction agenda
[3:08:37.880 --> 3:08:41.880]  go over some of the facts, how they're doing it, what the mercury
[3:08:41.880 --> 3:08:45.880]  and the vaccines, what the rest of the cancer viruses found in hundreds of vaccines are doing
[3:08:45.880 --> 3:08:49.880]  why we've gone from 1 in 33 with cancer to 1 in 3
[3:08:49.880 --> 3:08:53.880]  while this is happening and what the globalist master plan says.
[3:08:53.880 --> 3:08:57.880]  I remember the official United Nations biological diversity assessments
[3:08:57.880 --> 3:09:01.880]  that are in my film, I wrote a tyranny, that you can get at any library say
[3:09:01.880 --> 3:09:05.880]  they plan to re-institute human sacrifice
[3:09:05.880 --> 3:09:09.880]  at giant temples to reduce our numbers. Now look, I can't
[3:09:09.880 --> 3:09:13.880]  make this up. That sounds insane. Believe me
[3:09:13.880 --> 3:09:17.880]  when I first heard about it 10 years ago and went and looked it up at UT and got
[3:09:17.880 --> 3:09:21.880]  the UN reports and then videotaped it to put it in the film, I couldn't believe it.
[3:09:21.880 --> 3:09:25.880]  They are out of their minds lunatics
[3:09:25.880 --> 3:09:29.880]  but Collegula married his horse, Nero would
[3:09:29.880 --> 3:09:33.880]  go in and murder people dressed up like a werewolf at their dinner parties
[3:09:33.880 --> 3:09:37.880]  children chained down, these are mainline histories
[3:09:37.880 --> 3:09:41.880]  look at what Hitler did, they're always go crazy.
[3:09:41.880 --> 3:09:45.880]  Kim Jong-il has a seven story pleasure palace and has Asian
[3:09:45.880 --> 3:09:49.880]  starlets kidnapped that he rapes and kills. I mean I'm sorry
[3:09:49.880 --> 3:09:53.880]  that they're saying and doing this but
[3:09:53.880 --> 3:09:57.880]  I know it sounds insane but they say they're going to re-institute human sacrifice
[3:09:57.880 --> 3:10:01.880]  to control population as they did in Aztec temples
[3:10:01.880 --> 3:10:05.880]  and now they've built one, Tex Mars covers that in his new book.
[3:10:05.880 --> 3:10:09.880]  I mean this is Looney Tune Land, I'm not saying that
[3:10:09.880 --> 3:10:13.880]  any of this is even real, the point is they believe it, they believe
[3:10:13.880 --> 3:10:17.880]  that they are manifesting it. Let's go to Dr. Stan
[3:10:17.880 --> 3:10:21.880]  Monteef Radio Liberty syndicated radio talk show host, I now own
[3:10:21.880 --> 3:10:25.880]  more than 50 affiliates across the land last time I checked.
[3:10:25.880 --> 3:10:29.880]  Dr. Monteef thank you and your busy schedule doing five hours of radio a day for joining us sir.
[3:10:29.880 --> 3:10:33.880]  It's always a pleasure to be with you Alex.
[3:10:33.880 --> 3:10:37.880]  Dr. I'm going to try my best, you know I'm the king of interrupting because so much goes through my mind
[3:10:37.880 --> 3:10:41.880]  and I burn with a passion to inform people, walk through the
[3:10:41.880 --> 3:10:45.880]  history of population reduction, what we're facing and what
[3:10:45.880 --> 3:10:49.880]  the master plan is and then the Luciferian religion that drives it.
[3:10:49.880 --> 3:10:53.880]  Well basically of course these ideas really began back with
[3:10:53.880 --> 3:10:57.880]  Malthus who was an Anglican minister if you can believe it but
[3:10:57.880 --> 3:11:01.880]  he was writing a series of essays on
[3:11:01.880 --> 3:11:05.880]  population control in the late 1700s, early 1800s
[3:11:05.880 --> 3:11:09.880]  and he even talked about how we just couldn't let new children be born
[3:11:09.880 --> 3:11:13.880]  unless somebody had died off and talked about
[3:11:13.880 --> 3:11:17.880]  we didn't bring things out of control, we were going to have to begin building our cities next to stagnant
[3:11:17.880 --> 3:11:21.880]  ponds and discourage cleanliness and certainly
[3:11:21.880 --> 3:11:25.880]  oppose anybody who wanted to stop the spread of disease.
[3:11:25.880 --> 3:11:29.880]  Now we refer to these concepts as Malthusian, of course they were
[3:11:29.880 --> 3:11:33.880]  picked up by a fellow named Galton who followed him, was related to
[3:11:33.880 --> 3:11:37.880]  Darwin and then of course really came to America
[3:11:37.880 --> 3:11:41.880]  with Margaret Sanger in the early 1900s, all
[3:11:41.880 --> 3:11:45.880]  financed by the Rockefellers, Margaret Sanger really believed in population control
[3:11:45.880 --> 3:11:49.880]  but she believed in eugenics, that was what it was really about
[3:11:49.880 --> 3:11:53.880]  breathing the perfect people and doing away with the unworthy
[3:11:53.880 --> 3:11:57.880]  human wheezes to be referred to but what most people don't understand is that
[3:11:57.880 --> 3:12:01.880]  the ideas that Adolf Hitler brought in Germany
[3:12:01.880 --> 3:12:05.880]  but actually came from the United States, we actually had
[3:12:05.880 --> 3:12:09.880]  poor sterilization, they sterilized tens of thousands of people
[3:12:09.880 --> 3:12:13.880]  in the United States in the early 1920s and of course after
[3:12:13.880 --> 3:12:17.880]  the Second World War with the whore of the Holocaust
[3:12:17.880 --> 3:12:21.880]  and if you understand that from the Nazi point of view
[3:12:21.880 --> 3:12:25.880]  that this was simply applied science, they were doing
[3:12:25.880 --> 3:12:29.880]  away with the unworthy people, the Jews, the Gypsies, the
[3:12:29.880 --> 3:12:33.880]  mentally defective, those with physical handicaps, those who were genetically
[3:12:33.880 --> 3:12:37.880]  defective, they were purifying the gene pool, that's what it was about
[3:12:37.880 --> 3:12:41.880]  well of course eugenics got a bad name
[3:12:41.880 --> 3:12:45.880]  after the Second World War and after of course
[3:12:45.880 --> 3:12:49.880]  the people in the United States were totally in favor of this, they couldn't let the
[3:12:49.880 --> 3:12:53.880]  American people know that anymore, they could let them know that it was American
[3:12:53.880 --> 3:12:57.880]  corporations, GM, Ford, International, Telephone and Telegraph
[3:12:57.880 --> 3:13:01.880]  that were actually during the Second World War, were actually
[3:13:01.880 --> 3:13:05.880]  of course preparing the weapons of war, the tanks, the dive bombers,
[3:13:05.880 --> 3:13:09.880]  trucks, the military equipment that they'd often use, it was all
[3:13:09.880 --> 3:13:13.880]  financed largely from here in the United States, creating the best
[3:13:13.880 --> 3:13:17.880]  enemy money could buy and that of course at the end of the Second World War, why many of the
[3:13:17.880 --> 3:13:21.880]  scientists, the Nazi scientists, who were involved with
[3:13:21.880 --> 3:13:25.880]  of course creating new diseases, who were involved
[3:13:25.880 --> 3:13:29.880]  with mind control and of course with the space program, were brought to the United
[3:13:29.880 --> 3:13:33.880]  States under operation paperclip and of course
[3:13:33.880 --> 3:13:37.880]  we have a poor tape set on that, you can check that out on the internet
[3:13:37.880 --> 3:13:41.880]  wonderful book by Linda Hunt called The Secret Agenda
[3:13:41.880 --> 3:13:45.880]  on Operation Paperclip and then of course we helped
[3:13:45.880 --> 3:13:49.880]  10,000 of the most vicious of the Nazi criminals
[3:13:49.880 --> 3:13:53.880]  escape to South America, the CIA, MI6, had a
[3:13:53.880 --> 3:13:57.880]  cell within the Vatican, helped 10,000 Nazis escape to South America
[3:13:57.880 --> 3:14:01.880]  Martin Borman should be Dr. Mengele, Klaus Barbee
[3:14:01.880 --> 3:14:05.880]  made off Eichmann, the Jews tracked down
[3:14:05.880 --> 3:14:09.880]  a couple of them, Eichmann and Barbee, but of course the CIA
[3:14:09.880 --> 3:14:13.880]  protected the rest of them, people find it difficult
[3:14:13.880 --> 3:14:17.880]  to believe and yet these were the people who carried out the Holocaust because they
[3:14:17.880 --> 3:14:21.880]  had friends in the United States. Now Dr. I want to just add
[3:14:21.880 --> 3:14:25.880]  Eugenics with sterilization 500,000 plus continued
[3:14:25.880 --> 3:14:29.880]  until 1987, publicly through health departments and
[3:14:29.880 --> 3:14:33.880]  the blood-taking and birth of babies, all of that is about the Eugenics program
[3:14:33.880 --> 3:14:37.880]  and also public Eugenics was about purifying the elite,
[3:14:37.880 --> 3:14:41.880]  exterminating the sub-Humans, but the real Eugenics
[3:14:41.880 --> 3:14:45.880]  at the higher level as they wrote and as my film in-game covers and as you know
[3:14:45.880 --> 3:14:49.880]  is really about dumbing us down and having a servant class
[3:14:49.880 --> 3:14:53.880]  for the elite, is it not? Well those who are allowed to live but they intend
[3:14:53.880 --> 3:14:57.880]  to kill off most of the people in the world. Now certainly anybody
[3:14:57.880 --> 3:15:01.880]  who questions that is only to read the writings of Jacques Cousteau and we
[3:15:01.880 --> 3:15:05.880]  actually provide this to our ministry in an article
[3:15:05.880 --> 3:15:09.880]  that is published in the UNESCO Courier in November of 1991
[3:15:09.880 --> 3:15:13.880]  by Jacques Cousteau, who everybody knows, oh my goodness
[3:15:13.880 --> 3:15:17.880]  he invented the scuba gear and he swam with the
[3:15:17.880 --> 3:15:21.880]  dolphin. Jacques Cousteau discussed the need to bring
[3:15:21.880 --> 3:15:25.880]  the world back into balance and said you know it's a terrible thing
[3:15:25.880 --> 3:15:29.880]  and they have to eliminate 350,000
[3:15:29.880 --> 3:15:33.880]  people a day. 350,000 people a day
[3:15:33.880 --> 3:15:37.880]  is a terrible thing to say but even worse not to say it.
[3:15:37.880 --> 3:15:41.880]  And of course you talk, you read the writings of Bertrand Russell in his book
[3:15:41.880 --> 3:15:45.880]  The Impact of Science on Society. We talked about
[3:15:45.880 --> 3:15:49.880]  we really don't kill off enough with abortion and with war, but we needed
[3:15:49.880 --> 3:15:53.880]  the black plague to sweep the world once in every generation.
[3:15:53.880 --> 3:15:57.880]  Of course now Jacques Cousteau's son has all these TV shows and it's always
[3:15:57.880 --> 3:16:01.880]  Humans Are Bad, All These Nature Shows, Humans Are Bad
[3:16:01.880 --> 3:16:05.880]  and Dr. Pionka gives speeches saying kill 90% of us and he gets a standing
[3:16:05.880 --> 3:16:09.880]  ovation. They are the majority. They're in place now.
[3:16:09.880 --> 3:16:13.880]  Well they're in positions of power and as incredible as it may seem
[3:16:13.880 --> 3:16:17.880]  they're actually carrying out these programs on the American
[3:16:17.880 --> 3:16:21.880]  people today. I got involved in this with the AIDS epidemic and
[3:16:21.880 --> 3:16:25.880]  it didn't make any sense if we weren't doing the logical things to try to stop this
[3:16:25.880 --> 3:16:29.880]  epidemic. Basically you stop a sexually transmitted
[3:16:29.880 --> 3:16:33.880]  disease by identifying who has it, find out who they got it from
[3:16:33.880 --> 3:16:37.880]  and who they spread it to and force these people to stop
[3:16:37.880 --> 3:16:41.880]  spreading a deadly disease. Every effort was paid to stop
[3:16:41.880 --> 3:16:45.880]  trying to identify the people who were infected or we couldn't do
[3:16:45.880 --> 3:16:49.880]  routine testing. Oh my goodness we'd drive the disease underground
[3:16:49.880 --> 3:16:53.880]  nobody would go to the doctor if they knew they're going to be tested for AIDS.
[3:16:53.880 --> 3:16:57.880]  We couldn't do premarital testing. This is a sexually transmitted disease.
[3:16:57.880 --> 3:17:01.880]  What's wrong with premarital testing? Oh my goodness people wouldn't
[3:17:01.880 --> 3:17:05.880]  go to the doctor if they were going to be tested. We do
[3:17:05.880 --> 3:17:09.880]  prenatal testing, pregnant women to prevent the mother who has the disease
[3:17:09.880 --> 3:17:13.880]  from spreading it. Terrenborn child and it's preventable. We do not do
[3:17:13.880 --> 3:17:17.880]  neonatal testing. We do not do any of the things. There are a few states
[3:17:17.880 --> 3:17:21.880]  where they do neonatal testing. Finally after about 15 years
[3:17:21.880 --> 3:17:25.880]  the Centers for Disease Control did come out and say well maybe we ought to do
[3:17:25.880 --> 3:17:29.880]  routine testing but of course we blocked this in other countries
[3:17:29.880 --> 3:17:33.880]  in Africa today. This is being used for population control.
[3:17:33.880 --> 3:17:37.880]  If you go into Botswana and we have the reports
[3:17:37.880 --> 3:17:41.880]  anybody wants to verify them we'll be glad to provide them.
[3:17:41.880 --> 3:17:45.880]  In Botswana where the U.S. Commerce Department is monitoring
[3:17:45.880 --> 3:17:49.880]  the AIDS epidemic. Why are we spending money to monitor
[3:17:49.880 --> 3:17:53.880]  the AIDS epidemic in Botswana? Why? Because we want to see what a great
[3:17:53.880 --> 3:17:57.880]  job we're doing. 46% of the pregnant
[3:17:57.880 --> 3:18:01.880]  women there, they test every pregnant woman for HIV disease.
[3:18:01.880 --> 3:18:05.880]  46% are infected and they're all going to die.
[3:18:05.880 --> 3:18:09.880]  This disease is simply wiping out the populations of many African
[3:18:09.880 --> 3:18:13.880]  countries. The average age for instance in a place like Zimbabwe
[3:18:13.880 --> 3:18:17.880]  has dropped from about 64 down to about 38.
[3:18:17.880 --> 3:18:21.880]  Well even doctors as you know, even the BBCs had to admit that
[3:18:21.880 --> 3:18:25.880]  they find young girls who've never been sexually active, virgins
[3:18:25.880 --> 3:18:29.880]  and their family doesn't even have HIV and then they say
[3:18:29.880 --> 3:18:33.880]  they must have got it from dirty needles when they were vaccinated but then
[3:18:33.880 --> 3:18:37.880]  we found all sorts of sterilization compounds and other carrier viruses
[3:18:37.880 --> 3:18:41.880]  and things in shots and we have all these Nobel Prize winners coming out
[3:18:41.880 --> 3:18:45.880]  saying HIV and AIDS is engineered. Well there's no question it was
[3:18:45.880 --> 3:18:49.880]  engineered. We actually have the reports that the CIA tried to actually
[3:18:49.880 --> 3:18:53.880]  destroy. They're called the special virus cancer project or about
[3:18:53.880 --> 3:18:57.880]  two inches thick. They put out one every year for a number of years as they
[3:18:57.880 --> 3:19:01.880]  were engineering the new diseases. We know that they didn't tend to
[3:19:01.880 --> 3:19:05.880]  engineer new diseases because you can actually, we have the testimony
[3:19:05.880 --> 3:19:09.880]  of Dr. David McCarthy before the House
[3:19:09.880 --> 3:19:13.880]  continues. Stay there, stay there. I want to talk about this when we get back from break. I'm also going to talk to you
[3:19:13.880 --> 3:19:17.880]  in this four minute break behind the scenes. Dr. Montee for prisonplanet.tv
[3:19:17.880 --> 3:19:21.880]  viewers and folks who are on the internet. I want to come back to that to the full audience
[3:19:21.880 --> 3:19:25.880]  in four minutes. I want to ask you behind the scenes.
[3:19:25.880 --> 3:19:29.880]  You've got to go to thestreamsandinfowars.com folks. Whether or not
[3:19:29.880 --> 3:19:33.880]  you've seen the new Dr. Sock video that just got released
[3:19:33.880 --> 3:19:37.880]  in the last year, our guest is Dr. Stan Montee
[3:19:37.880 --> 3:19:41.880]  from DrLiberty.com is the website. He's an amazing treasure trove of information.
[3:19:41.880 --> 3:19:45.880]  We're going to be having him on a lot in the near future.
[3:19:45.880 --> 3:19:49.880]  When I learned that the accumulation of acidic waste was the likely cause of my painful joints,
[3:19:49.880 --> 3:19:53.880]  lack of energy and weight gain, I knew I would have to change to a more alkaline
[3:19:53.880 --> 3:19:57.880]  diet, but it just seems so difficult. Then a friend suggested I try
[3:19:57.880 --> 3:20:01.880]  a Jupiter water ionizer from SnyderHealth.com and detox my body
[3:20:01.880 --> 3:20:05.880]  even before I changed my diet by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[3:20:05.880 --> 3:20:09.880]  Drinking water? Now that's something I can handle. The guys at SnyderHealth
[3:20:09.880 --> 3:20:13.880]  took the time to explain all of the different options and helped me choose the ionizer that
[3:20:13.880 --> 3:20:17.880]  was right for me. I used my new Jupiter ionizer for everything, for drinking, for
[3:20:17.880 --> 3:20:21.880]  cooking, and since I've been drinking the water, I have more energy, my joint pains
[3:20:21.880 --> 3:20:25.880]  are gone, and I already lost seven pounds, and my skin
[3:20:25.880 --> 3:20:31.880]  looks great. Give them a call today at 877-356-2508
[3:20:31.880 --> 3:20:35.880]  to find out which ionizer is right for you. They offer a full 30-day money back guarantee

[3:20:43.880 --> 3:20:47.880]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon
[3:20:47.880 --> 3:20:51.880]  took us off the gold standard, the US dollar has been evaluating. What people don't
[3:20:51.880 --> 3:20:55.880]  know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances. Is there a way to
[3:20:55.880 --> 3:20:59.880]  prevent your portfolios from losing value? The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[3:20:59.880 --> 3:21:03.880]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years. If you
[3:21:03.880 --> 3:21:07.880]  had had $100,000 in cash, and $100,000 in gold and silver
[3:21:07.880 --> 3:21:11.880]  back in 1913, and kept them both until now, your cash
[3:21:11.880 --> 3:21:15.880]  would actually have the buying power of only $4,800, but
[3:21:15.880 --> 3:21:19.880]  your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3 million. The answer to

[3:23:53.880 --> 3:23:57.880]  Yeah, Planned Parenthood to Bill Gates' father runs
[3:23:57.880 --> 3:24:01.880]  is the premier eugenics organization set up by the Rockefeller Brothers Foundation.
[3:24:01.880 --> 3:24:05.880]  They started all the major cancer research 100 years ago
[3:24:05.880 --> 3:24:09.880]  and they'll roll your sleeves up, take that
[3:24:09.880 --> 3:24:13.880]  cancer injection, and then they're going to give you a false treatment that's meant
[3:24:13.880 --> 3:24:17.880]  to take all your wealth so you don't pass it on.
[3:24:17.880 --> 3:24:21.880]  Carousel, carousel, right out of the Logan's Run, getting rid of the
[3:24:21.880 --> 3:24:25.880]  slaves. Going back to Dr. Stan Monte finishing up
[3:24:25.880 --> 3:24:29.880]  with the CIA's virus cancer weapon program which is known as
[3:24:29.880 --> 3:24:33.880]  HIV, which is a cover virus for a bunch of black ops.
[3:24:33.880 --> 3:24:37.880]  And then let's get into suppressed cancer treatments. He is a medical doctor
[3:24:37.880 --> 3:24:41.880]  and surgeon. By the way, quite an acclaimed one. Dr. Monte, please
[3:24:41.880 --> 3:24:45.880]  continue. Well, basically all the evidence
[3:24:45.880 --> 3:24:49.880]  shows that they actually created new diseases. Now if we knew that
[3:24:49.880 --> 3:24:53.880]  they were going to do this, first of all because Dr. David
[3:24:53.880 --> 3:24:57.880]  MacArthur and we actually have the complete text of his testimony
[3:24:57.880 --> 3:25:01.880]  testifying before the House Appropriations Committee back in 1969
[3:25:01.880 --> 3:25:05.880]  said that they wanted to be able to create two things. One
[3:25:05.880 --> 3:25:09.880]  would be a new disease for which there would be no immune response
[3:25:09.880 --> 3:25:13.880]  and the other would be new chronic diseases. And he said
[3:25:13.880 --> 3:25:17.880]  some people say we shouldn't do this because it would be another means of mass killing
[3:25:17.880 --> 3:25:21.880]  but we want ten million dollars and within ten years we can come up
[3:25:21.880 --> 3:25:25.880]  with this new disease. Well now of course we know that the CIA
[3:25:25.880 --> 3:25:29.880]  works with the military. We know that the CIA was actually
[3:25:29.880 --> 3:25:33.880]  creating new diseases. How do we know that? Well, a couple of things.
[3:25:33.880 --> 3:25:37.880]  First of all, Gary Glum came out with a book called Full Disclosure
[3:25:37.880 --> 3:25:41.880]  and one of the people who had been involved in this had actually
[3:25:41.880 --> 3:25:45.880]  come to him. He was dying of cancer of the pancreas
[3:25:45.880 --> 3:25:49.880]  and he told him the whole story. It was an interesting
[3:25:49.880 --> 3:25:53.880]  experience and thought control to try to get a copy of Gary Glum's
[3:25:53.880 --> 3:25:57.880]  book Full Disclosure up on the internet. Once in a while one comes up with a
[3:25:57.880 --> 3:26:01.880]  fantastic profit price and then of course Dr. Garth Nicholson who we've
[3:26:01.880 --> 3:26:05.880]  interviewed has talked to at least one person who was
[3:26:05.880 --> 3:26:09.880]  involved with the actual production of the AIDS epidemic.
[3:26:09.880 --> 3:26:13.880]  So certainly a few people have come forward
[3:26:13.880 --> 3:26:17.880]  risking their lives to tell the truth. And let's be clear, hundreds of top bioweapon
[3:26:17.880 --> 3:26:21.880]  scientists in the creation and identification have all
[3:26:21.880 --> 3:26:25.880]  been brutally murdered. I'm sure they have. So we've had
[3:26:25.880 --> 3:26:29.880]  all these microbiologists killings. Go ahead. But basically we
[3:26:29.880 --> 3:26:33.880]  have the reports. I have part 8 and part 9 and I think Boyd Graves
[3:26:33.880 --> 3:26:37.880]  has all of 8 on. They destroyed all of the early reports
[3:26:37.880 --> 3:26:41.880]  but we have 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. They
[3:26:41.880 --> 3:26:45.880]  put them out every year. Orders were given. They were to be destroyed
[3:26:45.880 --> 3:26:49.880]  and well the CIA didn't do a very good job or maybe somebody wanted to have them for history
[3:26:49.880 --> 3:26:53.880]  but it tells how they created these new diseases. Of course
[3:26:53.880 --> 3:26:57.880]  what most people don't understand is that AIDS is not simply HIV infection.
[3:26:57.880 --> 3:27:01.880]  It is combined with mycoplasm infection of mycoplasm
[3:27:01.880 --> 3:27:05.880]  permanent and it is a genetically altered mycoplasm
[3:27:05.880 --> 3:27:09.880]  that and of course who owns the patent on it
[3:27:09.880 --> 3:27:13.880]  while the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. And so
[3:27:13.880 --> 3:27:17.880]  basically what people do not understand is how they got this out initially.
[3:27:17.880 --> 3:27:21.880]  And of course the way that they were able to disseminate
[3:27:21.880 --> 3:27:25.880]  HIV virus in the United States was that the Hepatitis B
[3:27:25.880 --> 3:27:29.880]  vaccine that was given to homosexuals in San Francisco,
[3:27:29.880 --> 3:27:33.880]  Los Angeles, New York City and those are the three cities where the epidemic
[3:27:33.880 --> 3:27:37.880]  began. We have a report from the San Francisco
[3:27:37.880 --> 3:27:41.880]  Department of Public Health and the articles will tell you that 75%
[3:27:41.880 --> 3:27:45.880]  of the foolish young homosexuals who volunteered for this
[3:27:45.880 --> 3:27:49.880]  study, 75% of the people who received the Hepatitis B vaccine
[3:27:49.880 --> 3:27:53.880]  contracted AIDS and most of them have long since
[3:27:53.880 --> 3:27:57.880]  dead. Same thing happened of course to the other cities but we have the report on San Francisco.
[3:27:57.880 --> 3:28:01.880]  It was in the areas in Africa where they used this same Hepatitis B
[3:28:01.880 --> 3:28:05.880]  vaccine. Of course you'll find the disease center, you'll find
[3:28:05.880 --> 3:28:09.880]  the islands of it. There are lots of parts of Africa where this disease is very rare
[3:28:09.880 --> 3:28:13.880]  that they just don't have it. And that's where they happen to not have
[3:28:13.880 --> 3:28:17.880]  the UN there doing, well I mean take Libya where they caught the doctors
[3:28:17.880 --> 3:28:21.880]  giving the children the HIV shots. I mean they were caught red handed.
[3:28:21.880 --> 3:28:25.880]  Now listen, for those that don't know, for police, military, those that serve,
[3:28:25.880 --> 3:28:29.880]  why does the military get this so much more often? They give this to the military getting out
[3:28:29.880 --> 3:28:33.880]  because they don't want Rambo types to go rogue on them.
[3:28:33.880 --> 3:28:37.880]  You've served your usefulness, you're given a soft kill weapon. Doctor,
[3:28:37.880 --> 3:28:41.880]  Medical Doctor Stan Monteev, we have all the documents on this, explain to them what a soft kill
[3:28:41.880 --> 3:28:45.880]  weapon is. Well you're going to have to tell me because I'm not acquainted with that term.
[3:28:45.880 --> 3:28:49.880]  Well you know a soft kill is a biological weapon that kills you slowly.
[3:28:49.880 --> 3:28:53.880]  Oh yeah, they've introduced these. I mean we have
[3:28:53.880 --> 3:28:57.880]  millions of Americans who have these chronic diseases, and of course
[3:28:57.880 --> 3:29:01.880]  everything is done to stop the truth from coming out. We actually
[3:29:01.880 --> 3:29:05.880]  if your listeners don't believe that they intended to create
[3:29:05.880 --> 3:29:09.880]  these chronic diseases, has only to get a copy of a zig-zoop
[3:29:09.880 --> 3:29:15.880]  between two ages, published in 1970. You can buy them on the internet now for about
[3:29:15.880 --> 3:29:19.880]  $100. But this is a little paperback, so I got $6 back in the early
[3:29:19.880 --> 3:29:23.880]  70s. Stay there, I want to hear about this. Hundreds of books how they're killing you, laughing.
[3:29:23.880 --> 3:29:27.880]  Remember officers, your mama shouldn't be dying at
[3:29:27.880 --> 3:29:31.880]  55 of cancer. Your government is murdering her with pleasure.
[3:29:33.880 --> 3:29:37.880]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.

[3:31:51.880 --> 3:31:55.880]  job. You like being a puppet, sir? You like being a puppet from the New World Order? How do the
[3:31:55.880 --> 3:31:59.880]  American people know that 9-11 was a stage? Was it engineered by you, David
[3:31:59.880 --> 3:32:03.880]  Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CFR?
[3:32:03.880 --> 3:32:07.880]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have

[3:32:47.880 --> 3:32:51.880]  Song says it all.
[3:32:51.880 --> 3:32:55.880]  It was I who shot the sheriff
[3:32:55.880 --> 3:32:59.880]  But I didn't shoot no deputy
[3:32:59.880 --> 3:33:03.880]  It was I who shot the sheriff
[3:33:03.880 --> 3:33:07.880]  It was I who shot the sheriff
[3:33:07.880 --> 3:33:11.880]  But I didn't shoot no deputy
[3:33:11.880 --> 3:33:15.880]  John Brown
[3:33:15.880 --> 3:33:19.880]  All around in my hometown
[3:33:19.880 --> 3:33:23.880]  They are trying to track me down
[3:33:23.880 --> 3:33:27.880]  They say they want to bring
[3:33:27.880 --> 3:33:31.880]  I if guilty
[3:33:31.880 --> 3:33:35.880]  For the life of a deputy
[3:33:35.880 --> 3:33:39.880]  For the life of a deputy
[3:33:39.880 --> 3:33:43.880]  But I say
[3:33:43.880 --> 3:33:47.880]  If I am guilty
[3:33:47.880 --> 3:33:51.880]  I shot the sheriff
[3:33:51.880 --> 3:33:55.880]  But I swear it wasn't self defense
[3:33:55.880 --> 3:33:59.880]  It was I who shot the sheriff
[3:33:59.880 --> 3:34:03.880]  But I didn't shoot no deputy
[3:34:03.880 --> 3:34:07.880]  They say it is a cop without a pen
[3:34:07.880 --> 3:34:11.880]  I say
[3:34:11.880 --> 3:34:15.880]  Sheriff John Brown always a guy
[3:34:15.880 --> 3:34:19.880]  For what
[3:34:19.880 --> 3:34:23.880]  I don't know now
[3:34:23.880 --> 3:34:27.880]  Every time I play a scene
[3:34:27.880 --> 3:34:31.880]  He say kill them before they grow
[3:34:31.880 --> 3:34:35.880]  He say kill them
[3:34:35.880 --> 3:34:39.880]  before they grow now
[3:34:39.880 --> 3:34:43.880]  And so yeah
[3:34:43.880 --> 3:34:47.880]  Bye bye bye I shot the sheriff
[3:34:47.880 --> 3:34:51.880]  But I didn't shoot no deputy
[3:34:55.880 --> 3:34:59.880]  I shot the sheriff
[3:34:59.880 --> 3:35:03.880]  But I didn't shoot no deputy
[3:35:07.880 --> 3:35:11.880]  Freedom came my way one day now
[3:35:11.880 --> 3:35:15.880]  And I started all around
[3:35:15.880 --> 3:35:19.880]  Yeah
[3:35:19.880 --> 3:35:23.880]  Then all of a sudden I saw sheriff John Brown
[3:35:23.880 --> 3:35:27.880]  He was in me to shoot I down
[3:35:27.880 --> 3:35:31.880]  So I, oh yes I
[3:35:31.880 --> 3:35:35.880]  I shot him down
[3:35:35.880 --> 3:35:39.880]  And I said
[3:35:39.880 --> 3:35:43.880]  I shot the sheriff
[3:35:43.880 --> 3:35:47.880]  That's Bob Marley live ladies and gentlemen
[3:35:47.880 --> 3:35:51.880]  Sheriff John Brown said you gotta kill them when they're little seeds
[3:35:51.880 --> 3:35:55.880]  Before they grow
[3:35:55.880 --> 3:35:59.880]  99% of our military has no idea
[3:35:59.880 --> 3:36:03.880]  What's going on 99% of our police
[3:36:03.880 --> 3:36:07.880]  You know the horror of knowing
[3:36:07.880 --> 3:36:11.880]  And I know the stories of the victims
[3:36:11.880 --> 3:36:15.880]  That Dr. Montee has going the library of congress
[3:36:15.880 --> 3:36:18.880]  And having the other scientists on
[3:36:18.880 --> 3:36:21.880]  Having the government documents knowing
[3:36:21.880 --> 3:36:25.880]  That they're putting cancer viruses and everybody's vaccines
[3:36:25.880 --> 3:36:27.880]  Knowing they're murdering us all
[3:36:27.880 --> 3:36:29.880]  Knowing they're hurting us
[3:36:29.880 --> 3:36:31.880]  Knowing they're doing and they're gunna keep
[3:36:31.880 --> 3:36:33.880]  And the elite says well look you know it
[3:36:33.880 --> 3:36:35.880]  And the public doesn't wake up so they deserve to die
[3:36:35.880 --> 3:36:39.600]  the future and they are carrying it out against all of us.
[3:36:39.600 --> 3:36:41.360]  A lot of you say, so what about them Africans?
[3:36:41.360 --> 3:36:42.600]  We do need to kill them.
[3:36:42.600 --> 3:36:44.040]  I run into environmentalists, they're like,
[3:36:44.040 --> 3:36:47.560]  it's very sad, but the earth is dying, we must do it.
[3:36:47.560 --> 3:36:48.400]  But you tell them, oh, you know,
[3:36:48.400 --> 3:36:50.400]  the soft kills being done to you and they say,
[3:36:50.400 --> 3:36:54.280]  what am I gonna, not me, I have to make sure
[3:36:54.280 --> 3:36:55.880]  all this is carried out.
[3:36:57.240 --> 3:36:59.560]  Dr. Monteef, let's get into more about
[3:36:59.560 --> 3:37:01.360]  their biological weapons program against us
[3:37:01.360 --> 3:37:03.480]  and how they're suppressing cancer cures
[3:37:03.480 --> 3:37:06.360]  in their own documents and then take some calls.
[3:37:06.360 --> 3:37:08.120]  Well, I mean, there's just so much to cover,
[3:37:08.120 --> 3:37:10.080]  but basically, of course, we were just talking
[3:37:10.080 --> 3:37:13.560]  about Zygna Prisinski in his book, Between Two Ages,
[3:37:13.560 --> 3:37:17.680]  and of course, somewhere between pages 55 and 65,
[3:37:17.680 --> 3:37:18.920]  I don't have the exact page,
[3:37:18.920 --> 3:37:20.160]  although if anybody wants to get,
[3:37:20.160 --> 3:37:23.000]  that's what it, we'll get them copies of the page.
[3:37:23.000 --> 3:37:25.360]  At the bottom of the page, Zygna Prisinski,
[3:37:25.360 --> 3:37:27.280]  who was the man, foreign policy,
[3:37:27.280 --> 3:37:29.760]  national security advisor to Clinton,
[3:37:29.760 --> 3:37:31.440]  pardon me too, I'm Jimmy Carter,
[3:37:31.440 --> 3:37:35.680]  actually, I was there when Saddam Hussein came to power,
[3:37:35.680 --> 3:37:38.320]  he was instrumental in topping the Shah of Iran,
[3:37:38.320 --> 3:37:41.200]  he was instrumental in precipitating the war
[3:37:41.200 --> 3:37:43.000]  in Afghanistan, and of course,
[3:37:43.000 --> 3:37:45.400]  he was instrumental in bringing the Ayatollah,
[3:37:45.400 --> 3:37:49.560]  the radical to power in Afghanistan,
[3:37:49.560 --> 3:37:52.160]  the ones that we're talking about going to war with today,
[3:37:52.160 --> 3:37:55.840]  but Zygna Prisinski, writing back in 1970 in a book,
[3:37:55.840 --> 3:37:59.360]  Between Two Ages, talked about how in the future,
[3:37:59.360 --> 3:38:02.000]  we were going to be able to create storms,
[3:38:02.000 --> 3:38:05.200]  and droughts, and new chronic diseases
[3:38:05.200 --> 3:38:08.840]  to disabled the enemy, because we are the enemy.
[3:38:08.840 --> 3:38:10.440]  Today, Zygna Prisinski, of course,
[3:38:10.440 --> 3:38:14.520]  is the foreign policy advisor to a man named Barack Obama,
[3:38:14.520 --> 3:38:15.760]  Barack Hussein Obama.
[3:38:15.760 --> 3:38:17.880]  So he's been around for a long time,
[3:38:17.880 --> 3:38:19.560]  that was 38 years ago,
[3:38:19.560 --> 3:38:22.720]  but he was writing at that time about these chronic diseases
[3:38:22.720 --> 3:38:25.600]  they were gonna be able to create.
[3:38:25.600 --> 3:38:29.480]  And Pris, about 10 years after David MacArthur
[3:38:29.480 --> 3:38:31.440]  asked for the $10 million,
[3:38:31.440 --> 3:38:34.800]  why we suddenly saw a whole flock of new diseases occurring.
[3:38:34.800 --> 3:38:36.440]  One, we call AIDS,
[3:38:36.440 --> 3:38:39.200]  but Pris is not simply HIV infection,
[3:38:39.200 --> 3:38:42.400]  it's associated with chronic mycoplasm infection,
[3:38:42.400 --> 3:38:45.600]  that does the damage that genetically modified
[3:38:45.600 --> 3:38:47.040]  mycoplasm fermentants,
[3:38:47.040 --> 3:38:48.600]  that this is covered in a wonderful book
[3:38:48.600 --> 3:38:50.520]  by one of the world's leading scientists,
[3:38:50.520 --> 3:38:52.560]  although it's done in fiction form,
[3:38:52.560 --> 3:38:56.960]  it's called Project Day Lily, and we actually carry the book,
[3:38:56.960 --> 3:39:01.040]  Project Day Lily by Dr. Gartham and Nancy Nicholson.
[3:39:01.040 --> 3:39:04.560]  But anyway, of course, about 10 years after
[3:39:04.560 --> 3:39:07.080]  Zygna Prisinski and David MacArthur,
[3:39:07.080 --> 3:39:09.440]  we're talking about creating new diseases,
[3:39:09.440 --> 3:39:12.720]  why suddenly appears chronic fatigue syndrome,
[3:39:12.720 --> 3:39:16.080]  fibro, myalgia, Lyme disease,
[3:39:16.080 --> 3:39:19.760]  and we're talking about about four million Americans
[3:39:19.760 --> 3:39:21.400]  having these terrible diseases.
[3:39:21.400 --> 3:39:23.400]  And as you know, doctor, they now admit
[3:39:23.400 --> 3:39:25.800]  that Lyme's weaponized came from Plum Island,
[3:39:25.800 --> 3:39:30.800]  they now admit that the bird flu came from there,
[3:39:30.800 --> 3:39:33.000]  not the bird flu, the West Nile,
[3:39:33.000 --> 3:39:34.200]  but they say it's an accident,
[3:39:34.200 --> 3:39:35.560]  but they're gonna move it from that island
[3:39:35.560 --> 3:39:38.160]  in the Atlantic Ocean to San Antonio, Texas.
[3:39:38.160 --> 3:39:41.920]  What is this 36 level four bioweapons labs
[3:39:41.920 --> 3:39:45.600]  in the middle of populated areas in level two security?
[3:39:45.600 --> 3:39:46.440]  What's that about?
[3:39:46.440 --> 3:39:48.440]  Plausible deniability when they release it?
[3:39:48.440 --> 3:39:50.040]  Well, when something happens, they'll say,
[3:39:50.040 --> 3:39:52.200]  oh, shucks, we just made another mistake,
[3:39:52.200 --> 3:39:53.640]  nobody's responsible.
[3:39:53.640 --> 3:39:55.240]  Just like Porton Down keeps releasing
[3:39:55.240 --> 3:39:57.320]  all this stuff on accident in England.
[3:39:57.320 --> 3:40:00.160]  And it's the end, of course, at Fort Yedrick
[3:40:00.160 --> 3:40:01.120]  and Maryland, of course,
[3:40:01.120 --> 3:40:03.480]  where they work on all these biological warfare agents.
[3:40:03.480 --> 3:40:05.000]  And that's where the anthrax came from,
[3:40:05.000 --> 3:40:07.360]  they just love us so much, that's good people.
[3:40:07.360 --> 3:40:09.720]  Oh, you know, Chris, the story about the anthrax,
[3:40:09.720 --> 3:40:12.240]  you know, the anthrax attack on America,
[3:40:12.240 --> 3:40:15.200]  isn't it interesting that it was only Democratic senators
[3:40:15.200 --> 3:40:18.760]  that received the anthrax-laden envelopes,
[3:40:18.760 --> 3:40:22.400]  and isn't it interesting that on the very day
[3:40:22.400 --> 3:40:24.760]  of the 9-1-1 attack, Dick Cheney,
[3:40:24.760 --> 3:40:26.640]  the White House staff and the president,
[3:40:26.640 --> 3:40:29.040]  started on Cipro, and the only reason you take that
[3:40:29.040 --> 3:40:31.120]  is if you were expecting an anthrax attack,
[3:40:31.120 --> 3:40:33.840]  why would they start on the evening of September 11th?
[3:40:33.840 --> 3:40:35.880]  And it was the New York head of emergency management
[3:40:35.880 --> 3:40:38.000]  who's a control demolition expert,
[3:40:38.000 --> 3:40:39.480]  and tied into control demolition,
[3:40:39.480 --> 3:40:42.120]  the rest of them who recommended they go on it.
[3:40:42.120 --> 3:40:42.960]  Right.
[3:40:42.960 --> 3:40:44.760]  What a nice man.
[3:40:44.760 --> 3:40:47.440]  The only reason you would take Cipro,
[3:40:47.440 --> 3:40:49.760]  because it's potentially dangerous to antibiotic,
[3:40:49.760 --> 3:40:52.640]  is if you knew an anthrax attack was coming,
[3:40:52.640 --> 3:40:55.880]  and if they knew an anthrax attack was coming,
[3:40:55.880 --> 3:40:57.800]  why did they warn the rest of it?
[3:40:57.800 --> 3:40:59.960]  And some idiots say, well, why would they go on it?
[3:40:59.960 --> 3:41:01.040]  It means they had a tip.
[3:41:01.040 --> 3:41:02.560]  I mean, if they knew right where it was going,
[3:41:02.560 --> 3:41:03.400]  why would they go?
[3:41:03.400 --> 3:41:04.920]  If they knew it was going to the Capitol,
[3:41:04.920 --> 3:41:06.080]  why would they do it in the White House?
[3:41:06.080 --> 3:41:07.760]  Because they knew it was going through
[3:41:07.760 --> 3:41:09.880]  the Maine Washington mail office
[3:41:09.880 --> 3:41:11.720]  where the two workers died.
[3:41:11.720 --> 3:41:13.240]  They knew they had to,
[3:41:13.240 --> 3:41:15.800]  even though they were launching the attack.
[3:41:15.800 --> 3:41:18.880]  Dr. Monteev, get into suppressed cancer cures,
[3:41:18.880 --> 3:41:21.120]  how the Rockefellers have the core of the market,
[3:41:21.120 --> 3:41:23.920]  the documents and eyewitnesses you have to that.
[3:41:23.920 --> 3:41:26.560]  Well, basically, they have been suppressing,
[3:41:26.560 --> 3:41:28.600]  actively suppressing cancer treatment.
[3:41:28.600 --> 3:41:31.200]  This is covered in a four tapes that we have
[3:41:31.200 --> 3:41:32.840]  called the New Order of the Barbarians,
[3:41:32.840 --> 3:41:37.000]  where Dr. Richard Day told a group of doctors
[3:41:37.000 --> 3:41:40.440]  in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1969
[3:41:40.440 --> 3:41:43.720]  that their treatments for cancer were being suppressed.
[3:41:43.720 --> 3:41:46.120]  And of course, there actually was a report.
[3:41:46.120 --> 3:41:48.200]  It was called the Fitzgerald report.
[3:41:48.200 --> 3:41:51.480]  It was actually put in the congressional record back
[3:41:51.480 --> 3:41:55.680]  in 1955 about all the suppressed cancer treatments.
[3:41:55.680 --> 3:41:58.200]  And it was interesting recently,
[3:41:58.200 --> 3:42:00.000]  somebody sent me $50 and said,
[3:42:00.000 --> 3:42:02.080]  give me a copy of the Fitzgerald report.
[3:42:02.080 --> 3:42:03.560]  I can't get it anyplace.
[3:42:03.560 --> 3:42:05.520]  It was in the congressional record.
[3:42:05.520 --> 3:42:07.840]  Well, I called everybody I knew,
[3:42:07.840 --> 3:42:10.040]  the National Health Association,
[3:42:10.040 --> 3:42:12.240]  you know, the various researchers.
[3:42:12.240 --> 3:42:14.120]  Everybody's heard the Fitzgerald report.
[3:42:14.120 --> 3:42:16.120]  You can read about it on the internet,
[3:42:16.120 --> 3:42:17.960]  but nobody had a report.
[3:42:17.960 --> 3:42:19.840]  Eventually, we were able to track it down
[3:42:19.840 --> 3:42:21.400]  in the congressional record.
[3:42:21.400 --> 3:42:23.200]  It's in one of our newsletters.
[3:42:23.200 --> 3:42:26.320]  But basically, and people go to radio-liberty.com
[3:42:26.320 --> 3:42:30.240]  and just scroll down on the newsletters
[3:42:30.240 --> 3:42:31.440]  for the Fitzgerald report.
[3:42:31.440 --> 3:42:34.080]  But in 1955, they were talking about
[3:42:34.080 --> 3:42:37.360]  leitrella, an effective treatment for cancer.
[3:42:37.360 --> 3:42:39.560]  They were talking about the hoxie treatment.
[3:42:39.560 --> 3:42:41.920]  They were talking about several other treatments
[3:42:41.920 --> 3:42:42.760]  that were available.
[3:42:42.760 --> 3:42:45.240]  Isn't leitrella the stuff out of cherries?
[3:42:45.240 --> 3:42:47.640]  No, it's out of apricot pits.
[3:42:47.640 --> 3:42:50.880]  But it's basically a specific vitamin.
[3:42:50.880 --> 3:42:54.720]  Actually, I talked to a man named Dean Burke.
[3:42:54.720 --> 3:42:59.360]  And Dean Burke was in charge of chemotherapy research
[3:42:59.360 --> 3:43:01.000]  at the National Cancer Institute,
[3:43:01.000 --> 3:43:03.440]  which is a subdivision of the NIH.
[3:43:03.440 --> 3:43:06.520]  And of course, I talked to Burke before he died.
[3:43:06.520 --> 3:43:08.800]  He told me that leitrella did work.
[3:43:08.800 --> 3:43:10.880]  They knew it worked.
[3:43:10.880 --> 3:43:13.640]  And that it wouldn't cure everybody.
[3:43:13.640 --> 3:43:15.360]  Sometimes people were too far gone,
[3:43:15.360 --> 3:43:18.280]  but he said it's far better than anything in chemotherapy.
[3:43:18.280 --> 3:43:22.440]  He said, I've been in chemotherapy research for 25 years.
[3:43:22.440 --> 3:43:25.960]  I have three filing cabinets full of information
[3:43:25.960 --> 3:43:26.800]  on leitrella.
[3:43:26.800 --> 3:43:29.520]  And I said, but what about the Smith?
[3:43:29.520 --> 3:43:33.520]  The, I forgot what it was.
[3:43:33.520 --> 3:43:36.480]  A Sloan Kettering evaluation of leitrella,
[3:43:36.480 --> 3:43:37.920]  where they said it didn't work.
[3:43:37.920 --> 3:43:40.280]  He said they actually fudged that.
[3:43:40.280 --> 3:43:41.240]  They knew it worked.
[3:43:41.240 --> 3:43:42.400]  And so they designed it.
[3:43:42.400 --> 3:43:43.720]  This is why I say cherry pits.
[3:43:43.720 --> 3:43:45.320]  I know it came out of apricots too,
[3:43:45.320 --> 3:43:48.160]  but I had a cancer doctor a few months ago
[3:43:48.160 --> 3:43:51.440]  I was talking to tell me that they found the,
[3:43:51.440 --> 3:43:54.760]  I don't know all the biology or all the chemical reactions,
[3:43:54.760 --> 3:43:56.200]  but explain me what leitrella is.
[3:43:56.200 --> 3:44:00.640]  But basically it's a safe cyanide base
[3:44:00.640 --> 3:44:04.040]  that is covered with some type of molecular structure
[3:44:04.040 --> 3:44:07.400]  in the plant so that the body passes it,
[3:44:07.400 --> 3:44:10.720]  but that it still terminates cancer cells.
[3:44:10.720 --> 3:44:12.440]  Somehow they absorb it,
[3:44:12.440 --> 3:44:13.800]  but the rest of the tissues don't.
[3:44:13.800 --> 3:44:16.360]  He said it was out of cherry pits and apricots.
[3:44:16.360 --> 3:44:18.000]  You're saying it's just out of apricots.
[3:44:18.000 --> 3:44:19.080]  Oh, no, I'm sure it is.
[3:44:19.080 --> 3:44:19.920]  Probably it is.
[3:44:19.920 --> 3:44:21.320]  And maybe in several things,
[3:44:21.320 --> 3:44:24.360]  but characteristically it comes out of apricot pits,
[3:44:24.360 --> 3:44:25.640]  but you're not going to get the mean.
[3:44:25.640 --> 3:44:27.640]  Don't go out and buy a lot of apricot pits
[3:44:27.640 --> 3:44:28.480]  and start eating them.
[3:44:28.480 --> 3:44:29.320]  No, it's very poisonous.
[3:44:29.320 --> 3:44:31.080]  It has to be especially prepared.
[3:44:31.080 --> 3:44:32.720]  You can get it in Mexico.
[3:44:32.720 --> 3:44:34.120]  You can get it in Germany.
[3:44:34.120 --> 3:44:36.600]  You can't get it in Mexico and America
[3:44:36.600 --> 3:44:38.840]  as they've targeted the American people.
[3:44:38.840 --> 3:44:42.560]  And any doctor who advocates this or uses this in America,
[3:44:42.560 --> 3:44:44.840]  they will come after and destroy it.
[3:44:44.840 --> 3:44:47.120]  They are actively suppressing treatment.
[3:44:47.120 --> 3:44:49.240]  Now there are lots of even better treatments.
[3:44:49.240 --> 3:44:50.440]  That was 50 years ago,
[3:44:50.440 --> 3:44:52.160]  but they're all being suppressed.
[3:44:52.160 --> 3:44:55.640]  Dr. Przensky down in Texas, in Houston, Texas,
[3:44:55.640 --> 3:44:57.960]  has the treatment that they know will, of course,
[3:44:57.960 --> 3:45:00.440]  take care of brain cancers in children
[3:45:00.440 --> 3:45:02.920]  and they will not allow it to be widely used.
[3:45:02.920 --> 3:45:05.000]  In fact, they tried to put Przensky in prison.
[3:45:05.000 --> 3:45:08.520]  Why? Because he was saving the lives of children.
[3:45:08.520 --> 3:45:12.000]  We actually have a poor tape set on Przensky's material
[3:45:12.000 --> 3:45:14.200]  with interviews with Przensky in the book
[3:45:14.200 --> 3:45:16.160]  of the Przensky Breakthrough Without a Print,
[3:45:16.160 --> 3:45:20.240]  but people have to understand effective cancer treatments
[3:45:20.240 --> 3:45:22.840]  will be suppressed because people are going to have to die
[3:45:22.840 --> 3:45:24.800]  of something and they want them to take care of it.
[3:45:24.800 --> 3:45:26.360]  And I want you to know this.
[3:45:26.360 --> 3:45:27.880]  People who serve the government,
[3:45:29.400 --> 3:45:30.680]  we've seen a change in the elite.
[3:45:30.680 --> 3:45:32.000]  We're about to go to calls.
[3:45:32.960 --> 3:45:34.760]  I mean, they were evil 20 years ago,
[3:45:34.760 --> 3:45:36.720]  but they wouldn't let the troops be around DU.
[3:45:36.720 --> 3:45:37.840]  Now they are.
[3:45:37.840 --> 3:45:40.760]  And the troops are coming back and dying in mass.
[3:45:40.760 --> 3:45:44.240]  They particularly shoot up the troops with this stuff.
[3:45:44.240 --> 3:45:45.920]  There are thousands of examples of them
[3:45:45.920 --> 3:45:47.520]  nerve-gassing our own troops.
[3:45:47.520 --> 3:45:49.120]  That came out in the news again last week,
[3:45:49.120 --> 3:45:51.800]  mainstream news, I mean, murdering them,
[3:45:51.800 --> 3:45:54.640]  radiating small children to death.
[3:45:54.640 --> 3:45:56.440]  I mean, there's thousands of cases
[3:45:56.440 --> 3:46:00.000]  and they did that to create the cadres of doctors
[3:46:00.000 --> 3:46:02.720]  in government who would carry out other ops.
[3:46:02.720 --> 3:46:05.520]  And I'm gonna have to have you back, Dr. Montee,
[3:46:05.520 --> 3:46:07.640]  for a full two hours in the near future.
[3:46:07.640 --> 3:46:09.000]  Let's take some phone calls.
[3:46:09.000 --> 3:46:10.360]  They'll be all over the map,
[3:46:10.360 --> 3:46:13.880]  but let's go ahead and so we can get to some of these.
[3:46:13.880 --> 3:46:16.560]  Go ahead and take a call from Lynn in Chicago.
[3:46:16.560 --> 3:46:17.480]  You're on the air.
[3:46:20.160 --> 3:46:22.120]  Go ahead, Lynn, are you there?
[3:46:22.120 --> 3:46:26.240]  Okay, we're gonna go to Chris in Minnesota.
[3:46:26.240 --> 3:46:28.200]  Go ahead, Chris in Minnesota.
[3:46:28.200 --> 3:46:29.440]  Yes, good afternoon, Alex.
[3:46:29.440 --> 3:46:30.640]  I'm sure that you're aware of
[3:46:30.640 --> 3:46:33.520]  and I'm sure that your guest, the doctor there,
[3:46:33.520 --> 3:46:35.720]  is aware of the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota here
[3:46:35.720 --> 3:46:39.160]  is one of the largest and most cutting-edge
[3:46:39.160 --> 3:46:41.480]  medical facilities in the United States.
[3:46:41.480 --> 3:46:43.560]  Kings and Queens come here for treatment.
[3:46:43.560 --> 3:46:45.480]  And a friend of mine works for a company
[3:46:45.480 --> 3:46:49.320]  who subcontracts to the Mayo Clinic
[3:46:49.320 --> 3:46:51.520]  for delivering, making deliveries.
[3:46:51.520 --> 3:46:53.320]  And he had to take a delivery the other day
[3:46:53.320 --> 3:46:56.840]  to this secluded place just on the outskirts of town.
[3:46:56.840 --> 3:47:00.880]  And he told me that it was covered with armed guard security
[3:47:00.880 --> 3:47:05.040]  and the rumor, I guess, is that it's a pig farm
[3:47:05.040 --> 3:47:08.600]  that they harvest organs in the pigs.
[3:47:08.600 --> 3:47:12.640]  They're growing organs for organ transplants for humans.
[3:47:12.640 --> 3:47:13.480]  Pigs and hogs.
[3:47:13.480 --> 3:47:18.080]  Well, sir, there's no rumor in utero and pigs and cows.
[3:47:18.080 --> 3:47:20.960]  They grow humanoids.
[3:47:20.960 --> 3:47:22.040]  You can't really call them that.
[3:47:22.040 --> 3:47:25.720]  It's ganglia from the doctors we've talked to.
[3:47:25.720 --> 3:47:27.120]  There's different processes.
[3:47:27.120 --> 3:47:29.800]  A lot of them, it's just, a lot of them, it is humanoids
[3:47:29.800 --> 3:47:32.000]  and they harvest the organs out of them in utero.
[3:47:32.000 --> 3:47:33.480]  Babies, basically.
[3:47:33.480 --> 3:47:34.840]  And that's actually in the news.
[3:47:34.840 --> 3:47:38.000]  Or sometimes it's just groups of organs
[3:47:38.000 --> 3:47:40.320]  within the pigs and cows.
[3:47:40.320 --> 3:47:42.640]  Dr. Montee, would you like to speak to that?
[3:47:42.640 --> 3:47:45.520]  Well, certainly we know that they're injecting human genes
[3:47:45.520 --> 3:47:49.080]  into the brains of an animal, of mice,
[3:47:49.080 --> 3:47:52.200]  so that they will actually have a human brain.
[3:47:52.200 --> 3:47:53.920]  The things that they're doing today
[3:47:53.920 --> 3:47:57.320]  are just totally a violation of God's plan for humanity.
[3:47:57.320 --> 3:47:59.080]  We have a book called The Eremont Cape.
[3:47:59.080 --> 3:48:03.280]  It's a fictionalized story of how they actually are cloning
[3:48:03.280 --> 3:48:08.200]  a human animal, cloned, that they're actually doing this.
[3:48:08.200 --> 3:48:12.200]  But those hybrids, I mean, if you Google human animal hybrid,
[3:48:12.200 --> 3:48:15.360]  it's pigs, it's goats, it's horses, it's pigs.
[3:48:15.360 --> 3:48:19.240]  They're growing, quote, human embryos and cows.
[3:48:19.240 --> 3:48:20.720]  I mean, that was 10 years ago.
[3:48:20.720 --> 3:48:24.360]  And what we're doing, of course, is we're violating
[3:48:24.360 --> 3:48:25.600]  all the laws of nature.
[3:48:25.600 --> 3:48:27.760]  And of course, we're going to be creating
[3:48:27.760 --> 3:48:29.760]  new Frankenstein type things.
[3:48:29.760 --> 3:48:31.280]  But on top of that, the general public
[3:48:31.280 --> 3:48:32.560]  isn't going to get access to this.
[3:48:32.560 --> 3:48:34.360]  And they also harvest our baby's blood.
[3:48:34.360 --> 3:48:36.440]  Then if they need it, they'll kidnap your kid
[3:48:36.440 --> 3:48:37.160]  for their organs.
[3:48:37.160 --> 3:48:38.320]  We know that's going on.
[3:48:38.320 --> 3:48:40.080]  That's why they want the blood samples at birth.
[3:48:40.080 --> 3:48:43.280]  The idiot doctors locally are compartmentalized and don't know.
[3:48:43.280 --> 3:48:47.520]  Did your friends say anything else about this facility?
[3:48:47.520 --> 3:48:49.440]  OK, let's go to Warren in Michigan.
[3:48:49.440 --> 3:48:52.000]  Warren in Michigan, you're on the air, then Jack Elliott,
[3:48:52.000 --> 3:48:52.760]  Ollie, and Mark.
[3:48:52.760 --> 3:48:55.200]  Go ahead, Warren, you're on the air with Dr. Monteef.
[3:48:55.200 --> 3:48:55.720]  Hey, Alex.
[3:48:55.720 --> 3:48:57.640]  Thanks for taking my call.
[3:48:57.640 --> 3:48:59.800]  I'm sorry, I'm not more prepared for your guest.
[3:48:59.800 --> 3:49:01.960]  I listen to the podcast on a day by day.
[3:49:01.960 --> 3:49:04.320]  So it's very interesting stuff.
[3:49:04.320 --> 3:49:05.400]  Go ahead and make a point.
[3:49:05.400 --> 3:49:08.440]  Make a comment that I lost an ant of mine
[3:49:08.440 --> 3:49:10.000]  to ovarian cancer.
[3:49:10.000 --> 3:49:13.880]  It's just amazing to me being woken up very recently
[3:49:13.880 --> 3:49:18.600]  that she was battling the cancer and then
[3:49:18.600 --> 3:49:21.520]  was obviously more heavily battling the treatment.
[3:49:21.520 --> 3:49:23.800]  And that's what our life was lost.
[3:49:23.800 --> 3:49:27.360]  So it's a lot of work there.
[3:49:27.360 --> 3:49:29.840]  I have to understand that many times the treatments
[3:49:29.840 --> 3:49:31.720]  do far more harm than good.
[3:49:31.720 --> 3:49:34.640]  Because the chemotherapy suppresses the immune system
[3:49:34.640 --> 3:49:36.640]  and can produce cancer itself.
[3:49:36.640 --> 3:49:39.120]  Irradiation can suppress the immune system
[3:49:39.120 --> 3:49:41.560]  and create cancer itself.
[3:49:41.560 --> 3:49:43.640]  And of course, there are natural treatments
[3:49:43.640 --> 3:49:45.120]  for a lot of these things.
[3:49:45.120 --> 3:49:46.840]  But people are going to have to get it
[3:49:46.840 --> 3:49:48.920]  without the United States. You're not going to get it
[3:49:48.920 --> 3:49:51.440]  in this country because they want our people to die.
[3:49:51.440 --> 3:49:55.160]  They are using us as guinea pigs for so many things.
[3:49:55.160 --> 3:49:57.560]  The average American has no grasp of what's going on.
[3:49:57.560 --> 3:49:58.920]  Well, doctor, take HPV.
[3:49:58.920 --> 3:50:00.800]  I know you can speak to that, but their own insert
[3:50:00.800 --> 3:50:03.160]  with the live cancer virus drug.
[3:50:03.160 --> 3:50:04.240]  It's a live virus.
[3:50:04.240 --> 3:50:07.200]  It says this actually gives you an increase in cancer.
[3:50:07.200 --> 3:50:09.960]  And it doesn't even protect you from the HPV.
[3:50:09.960 --> 3:50:12.200]  But they run out and take it.
[3:50:12.200 --> 3:50:16.800]  And how foolish people are to be taking this so-called
[3:50:16.800 --> 3:50:21.680]  cancer vaccine so that they can go out and be promiscuous.
[3:50:21.680 --> 3:50:24.440]  And of course, we're going to destroy the lives
[3:50:24.440 --> 3:50:28.800]  of literally millions of our young people by doing this.
[3:50:28.800 --> 3:50:30.480]  We're going to talk behind the scenes
[3:50:30.480 --> 3:50:34.200]  for Prison Planet and InfoWars.com stream listeners.
[3:50:34.200 --> 3:50:35.960]  We're going to be right back for everybody else.
[3:50:35.960 --> 3:50:38.160]  We're going to talk to Warren, Elliott, Ollie, and Mark
[3:50:38.160 --> 3:50:40.680]  before Dr. Monteev leaves us.
[3:50:40.680 --> 3:50:41.960]  I'm Alex Jones.
[3:50:41.960 --> 3:50:50.640]  Imagine walking down the street and hearing footsteps
[3:50:50.640 --> 3:50:51.640]  behind you.
[3:50:51.640 --> 3:50:53.240]  They get closer and closer.
[3:50:53.240 --> 3:50:55.000]  And suddenly, you have a sense something bad
[3:50:55.000 --> 3:50:56.440]  is going to happen.
[3:50:56.440 --> 3:50:58.920]  What are you going to do to defend yourself?
[3:50:58.920 --> 3:51:02.080]  Tebow Tech specializes in non-lethal self-defense products

[3:51:16.080 --> 3:51:17.680]  or to share with your family.

[3:51:26.580 --> 3:51:29.080]  with pepper spray all at a low price.
[3:51:29.080 --> 3:51:31.520]  With these or any of Tebow Tech's products,

[3:51:34.000 --> 3:51:35.800]  and get yourself to safety.

[3:51:38.240 --> 3:51:41.000]  Stuck up now, TebowTech.com.
[3:51:41.000 --> 3:51:45.360]  That's T-B-O-T-E-C-H.com.
[3:51:45.360 --> 3:51:47.360]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[3:51:47.360 --> 3:51:49.120]  The forces of globalism are destroying
[3:51:49.120 --> 3:51:51.000]  national sovereignty worldwide.
[3:51:51.000 --> 3:51:53.400]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[3:51:53.400 --> 3:51:54.840]  The first time in modern history,
[3:51:54.840 --> 3:51:56.440]  the people are beginning to wake up.
[3:51:56.440 --> 3:51:59.200]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate
[3:51:59.200 --> 3:52:01.280]  their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order
[3:52:01.280 --> 3:52:02.200]  master plan.
[3:52:02.200 --> 3:52:04.840]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize
[3:52:04.840 --> 3:52:06.400]  the people to meet this threat.
[3:52:06.400 --> 3:52:09.680]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon
[3:52:09.680 --> 3:52:11.640]  in the battle to regain our freedom.
[3:52:11.640 --> 3:52:14.600]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.
[3:52:14.600 --> 3:52:17.760]  All 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded or streamed

[3:52:24.760 --> 3:52:27.880]  to martial law can be found in this online video library.
[3:52:27.880 --> 3:52:29.680]  By weekly news, television broadcast,
[3:52:29.680 --> 3:52:32.720]  thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.
[3:52:32.720 --> 3:52:35.520]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.
[3:52:35.520 --> 3:52:37.600]  Join PrisonPlanet.tv.
[3:52:37.600 --> 3:52:39.600]  Burn the Info Bombs to disc.
[3:52:39.600 --> 3:52:41.720]  Put them on the file sharing networks.
[3:52:41.720 --> 3:52:43.520]  Bring down the New World Order.
[3:52:43.520 --> 3:52:45.360]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[3:52:45.360 --> 3:52:47.840]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants
[3:52:47.840 --> 3:52:49.640]  in our body and want them out.
[3:52:49.640 --> 3:52:53.200]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time tested.
[3:52:53.200 --> 3:52:55.720]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's
[3:52:55.720 --> 3:52:56.920]  thoughts on Cardivite.
[3:52:56.920 --> 3:52:59.240]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery
[3:52:59.240 --> 3:53:00.360]  to disease anymore.
[3:53:00.360 --> 3:53:02.880]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver
[3:53:02.880 --> 3:53:05.720]  covers at least 70%, 80% of the disease that we see.
[3:53:05.720 --> 3:53:07.040]  When we do our program, you know,
[3:53:07.040 --> 3:53:08.560]  in herpal formulas like Cardivite,
[3:53:08.560 --> 3:53:11.120]  and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill,
[3:53:11.120 --> 3:53:13.960]  now going for a regular job a few months later,
[3:53:13.960 --> 3:53:15.440]  we know we're doing something right.
[3:53:15.440 --> 3:53:16.800]  It's a well thought out formula.
[3:53:16.800 --> 3:53:19.920]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both
[3:53:19.920 --> 3:53:22.560]  at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[3:53:22.560 --> 3:53:25.000]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just
[3:53:25.000 --> 3:53:27.240]  on heart problems and circulation problems.
[3:53:27.240 --> 3:53:28.760]  It'll work on other problems as well.

[3:53:46.160 --> 3:53:48.240]  No, to the last of the world.

[3:53:49.240 --> 3:53:51.760]  No, to the last of the world.
[3:53:51.760 --> 3:53:53.120]  No, to the last of the world.
[3:53:53.120 --> 3:53:55.680]  For those behind the scenes, the information was so important.
[3:53:55.680 --> 3:53:58.360]  He was getting into how they had hormones to the tetanus
[3:53:58.360 --> 3:54:00.000]  shots to sterilize you women.
[3:54:00.000 --> 3:54:01.880]  Absolutely documented and caught red-handed
[3:54:01.880 --> 3:54:05.080]  by medical research facilities all over the world.
[3:54:05.080 --> 3:54:06.880]  We're going to try to cram in a few final calls.
[3:54:06.880 --> 3:54:08.560]  Ollie in Canada.
[3:54:08.560 --> 3:54:11.520]  Ollie, you're on the air with Dr. Stan Monteef.
[3:54:11.520 --> 3:54:12.520]  Yeah, hi.
[3:54:12.520 --> 3:54:17.320]  Alex, I have a question first off for Doc.
[3:54:17.320 --> 3:54:21.640]  Doc, do you have a website where you have, huh?
[3:54:21.640 --> 3:54:22.880]  Radio Liberty dot com.
[3:54:22.880 --> 3:54:24.120]  Radio Liberty dot com.
[3:54:24.120 --> 3:54:24.880]  Radio Liberty dot com.
[3:54:24.880 --> 3:54:26.000]  It's been saying it over and over again.
[3:54:26.000 --> 3:54:27.200]  Radio Liberty dot com.
[3:54:27.200 --> 3:54:30.760]  Sorry, maybe I'm not mad at you, sir.
[3:54:30.760 --> 3:54:31.640]  We're just under attack here.
[3:54:31.640 --> 3:54:32.960]  This is an emergency situation.
[3:54:32.960 --> 3:54:33.720]  Right, right.
[3:54:33.720 --> 3:54:37.480]  OK, another thing, Doc, I want to ask you.
[3:54:37.480 --> 3:54:43.000]  In the, when you were in the university or anything,
[3:54:43.000 --> 3:54:46.600]  in your textbooks, did they ever mention
[3:54:46.600 --> 3:54:53.200]  that the best way to beat cancer is to aid the immune system?
[3:54:53.200 --> 3:54:54.840]  Did they ever mention that?
[3:54:54.840 --> 3:54:55.320]  No.
[3:54:55.320 --> 3:54:57.720]  No, we were taught, of course, you do surgery,
[3:54:57.720 --> 3:55:01.200]  you do chemotherapy, you do radiation.
[3:55:01.200 --> 3:55:02.120]  That's what they call it.
[3:55:02.120 --> 3:55:03.320]  Burn it, cut it, poison it.
[3:55:03.320 --> 3:55:06.880]  It's always to treat the final equation,
[3:55:06.880 --> 3:55:09.560]  never prevent or never use the body to heal anything.
[3:55:09.560 --> 3:55:11.440]  That's the school of medicine.
[3:55:11.440 --> 3:55:15.520]  Doc, you know, I'm so surprised that you actually said that
[3:55:15.520 --> 3:55:20.480]  because I have so many doctors in my own family.
[3:55:20.480 --> 3:55:23.360]  Like, I have my aunts, my uncles, they're all doctors,
[3:55:23.360 --> 3:55:25.160]  but they're not in the United States.
[3:55:25.160 --> 3:55:26.920]  They're elsewhere.
[3:55:26.920 --> 3:55:31.320]  And I've had enough of my relatives die from cancer.
[3:55:31.320 --> 3:55:36.320]  And one of them has happened to be the first life of my uncle.
[3:55:36.320 --> 3:55:37.080]  All right, I got a job.
[3:55:37.080 --> 3:55:37.960]  The show's over.
[3:55:37.960 --> 3:55:38.440]  Thank you, sir.
[3:55:38.440 --> 3:55:39.480]  I got to let you go.
[3:55:39.480 --> 3:55:42.160]  Dr. Montee, I want to thank you for spending time with us.
[3:55:42.160 --> 3:55:44.960]  I want to have you back up for two hours in the near future.
[3:55:44.960 --> 3:55:46.440]  Thank you for spending time with us.
[3:55:46.440 --> 3:55:47.600]  Yeah, I always enjoy it.
[3:55:47.600 --> 3:55:48.240]  God bless.
[3:55:48.240 --> 3:55:48.560]  Bye-bye.
[3:55:48.560 --> 3:55:49.000]  Take care.
[3:55:49.000 --> 3:55:50.720]  We'll have him up for two hours in the near future.
[3:55:50.720 --> 3:55:52.560]  Great guy, RadioLiberty.com.
[3:55:52.560 --> 3:55:54.160]  It's all documented with him.
[3:55:54.160 --> 3:55:55.360]  All documented.
[3:55:55.360 --> 3:55:56.360]  All documented.
[3:55:56.360 --> 3:55:57.400]  Do you understand women?
[3:55:57.400 --> 3:55:58.560]  That's why you can't have babies.
[3:55:58.560 --> 3:56:00.760]  You've been hit hard with sterilization compounds.
[3:56:00.760 --> 3:56:02.800]  Your daughters are out taking this HPV.
[3:56:02.800 --> 3:56:04.120]  It's hurting them bad.
[3:56:04.120 --> 3:56:08.040]  That you're under attack now, period.
[3:56:08.040 --> 3:56:09.760]  People say, oh, don't get so upset.
[3:56:09.760 --> 3:56:10.800]  We need to get upset.
[3:56:10.800 --> 3:56:12.320]  We need to shake out of it.
[3:56:12.320 --> 3:56:14.320]  Shake out of the days and realize.
[3:56:14.320 --> 3:56:16.560]  I mean, I looked at Eric Prince, the head of Blackwater.
[3:56:16.560 --> 3:56:18.840]  His 30-year-old wife died of cancer.
[3:56:18.840 --> 3:56:20.520]  I mean, just everybody's dying of this stuff.
[3:56:20.520 --> 3:56:22.960]  It's like the flu now.
[3:56:22.960 --> 3:56:25.000]  1 in 33 used to die of it now, 1 in 3.
[3:56:25.000 --> 3:56:26.640]  They're saying 1 in 2.
[3:56:26.640 --> 3:56:29.400]  We're all going to die while these bastards soft kill us,
[3:56:29.400 --> 3:56:32.400]  while they're all living to be 103.
[3:56:32.400 --> 3:56:33.800]  Probably staged in their own death.
[3:56:33.800 --> 3:56:34.840]  These pieces of filth.
[3:56:38.800 --> 3:56:40.560]  I had a lot of key guests gone today.
[3:56:40.560 --> 3:56:42.440]  Retransmission starts here in a few minutes.
[3:56:42.440 --> 3:56:43.560]  I hope you get Truth Rising.
[3:56:43.560 --> 3:56:45.520]  It won't be a big film without you.
[3:56:45.520 --> 3:56:48.080]  Truth Rising, my new film about 9-Eleven
[3:56:48.080 --> 3:56:50.200]  and how they're demonizing 9-Eleven Truth
[3:56:50.200 --> 3:56:52.320]  and how we're countering them and all the celebrities
[3:56:52.320 --> 3:56:54.480]  we interview and all the globalists that are confronted.
[3:56:54.480 --> 3:57:03.040]  It is the must-see film, infowars.com or 888-253-3139.
[3:57:03.040 --> 3:57:06.480]  And if you have the film, I want you to make copies of it.
[3:57:06.480 --> 3:57:08.800]  Another sponsor that makes the show possible
[3:57:08.800 --> 3:57:12.200]  is a great water filter system.
[3:57:12.200 --> 3:57:14.360]  But all you need is electricity, and it grabs gallons
[3:57:14.360 --> 3:57:16.560]  and gallons and gallons and gallons even in the desert
[3:57:16.560 --> 3:57:20.000]  of water out of the air every single day.
[3:57:20.000 --> 3:57:23.920]  It is a cola blue. Website is E-C-O-L-O blue.com,
[3:57:23.920 --> 3:57:27.000]  big fat banner in the middle of infowars.com.
[3:57:27.000 --> 3:57:31.200]  E-Colo blue.com, E-C-O-L-O blue.com.
[3:57:31.200 --> 3:57:35.880]  Tell them, Alex Jones, since you 1-866-585-4044
[3:57:35.880 --> 3:57:39.440]  and atmospheric water generator for the home
[3:57:39.440 --> 3:57:42.000]  pays for itself within one year if you buy
[3:57:42.000 --> 3:57:44.280]  from your water at the store, pure clean water
[3:57:44.280 --> 3:57:46.520]  without the fluoride, five filters in it.
[3:57:46.520 --> 3:57:48.040]  You do do got to clean it out once a month.
[3:57:48.040 --> 3:57:50.280]  It's limited water from humidity in the air.
[3:57:50.280 --> 3:57:54.560]  1-866-585-4044, we got one in the office.
[3:57:54.560 --> 3:57:57.680]  Great tasting, pure H2O, exactly the way nature makes it.
[3:57:57.680 --> 3:58:00.440]  No chemicals, pollutants or toxins, natural pH.
[3:58:00.440 --> 3:58:03.680]  866-585-4044.
[3:58:03.680 --> 3:58:06.400]  Like I said, this isn't a game, it's not a joke.
[3:58:07.600 --> 3:58:08.880]  I need everybody to spread the word
[3:58:08.880 --> 3:58:10.920]  about the internet streams at infowars.com
[3:58:10.920 --> 3:58:12.560]  and the free podcast.
[3:58:12.560 --> 3:58:14.800]  The AM and FM stations were on the short wave.
[3:58:14.800 --> 3:58:16.760]  We are the most important show out there
[3:58:16.760 --> 3:58:18.480]  because we tell it like it is and we know
[3:58:18.480 --> 3:58:20.600]  what the key issues are.
[3:58:20.600 --> 3:58:23.200]  Okay, not repeating groups' names over and over again,
[3:58:23.200 --> 3:58:25.600]  but exposing what they're doing and warning people.
[3:58:26.680 --> 3:58:28.640]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[3:58:29.960 --> 3:58:32.400]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[3:58:35.680 --> 3:58:39.400]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds
[3:58:39.400 --> 3:58:41.480]  of my fellow troops, I went to grounds here
[3:58:41.480 --> 3:58:44.800]  and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[3:58:44.800 --> 3:58:47.640]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film
[3:58:47.640 --> 3:58:50.280]  that finally gives first responders a platform
[3:58:50.280 --> 3:58:51.840]  to tell their story.
[3:58:51.840 --> 3:58:56.840]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement
[3:58:58.000 --> 3:59:00.720]  that the air was safe to breathe.
[3:59:00.720 --> 3:59:03.600]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth
[3:59:03.600 --> 3:59:05.640]  as brave souls throughout the world
[3:59:05.640 --> 3:59:07.840]  take action against their global masters.
[3:59:07.840 --> 3:59:09.560]  He had his hand over the radio
[3:59:09.560 --> 3:59:11.040]  while he was getting a countdown.
[3:59:11.040 --> 3:59:13.800]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one,
[3:59:13.800 --> 3:59:16.800]  and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[3:59:16.800 --> 3:59:19.840]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[3:59:28.800 --> 3:59:31.240]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror,
[3:59:31.240 --> 3:59:34.160]  they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[3:59:38.400 --> 3:59:40.120]  You are listening to GCN,
[3:59:40.120 --> 3:59:43.920]  the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
