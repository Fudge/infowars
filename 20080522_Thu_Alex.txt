[00:00.000 --> 00:09.000]  media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN
[00:09.000 --> 00:33.000]  Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:33.000 --> 00:44.000]  Well, we've got a big broadcast lined up for you today. It is the 22nd day of May, 2008.
[00:44.000 --> 00:50.000]  We're going to be live for the next four hours. Eric Nordstrom is joining us in 30 minutes.
[00:50.000 --> 00:56.000]  He came up with the idea for the Info Wars, moneybomb.com idea. He'll be popping in for
[00:56.000 --> 01:01.000]  about 10 minutes with us to track what's happening there, coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:01.000 --> 01:06.000]  Tommy Chong will spend a full hour with us when I took a couple of day vacation with the family
[01:06.000 --> 01:13.000]  a few weeks ago. He got rated the documentary filmmaker of the film Tommy Chong, aka Tommy Chong,
[01:13.000 --> 01:19.000]  got rated for their evil political speech. He's going to be joining us to talk about the aftermath of that.
[01:19.000 --> 01:23.000]  Smoking marijuana with Governor Schwarzenegger. He'll be here to talk about the phony drug war
[01:23.000 --> 01:28.000]  and a lot more. 30 minutes into the interview, Kevin Booth, maker of the film that I consulted on,
[01:28.000 --> 01:36.000]  American Drug War, will be popping in with us. And then Jeffrey Jensen, and he is the head of
[01:36.000 --> 01:46.000]  the National Forensic Organization. He is the head of the group that is basically involved
[01:46.000 --> 01:51.000]  of all of the different coroners, and they've come out and they've said it is amazing.
[01:51.000 --> 01:56.000]  The head of the National Medical Examiner's Association. There you go. Got it out of my brain.
[01:56.000 --> 02:03.000]  They're in the deep file because they're saying, look, the taser can't sue medical examiners
[02:03.000 --> 02:08.000]  and doctors for saying tasers kill people. I mean, now it's thousands worldwide.
[02:08.000 --> 02:14.000]  Somebody every day in the US, it's accelerating as they serve out more tasers globally here
[02:14.000 --> 02:21.000]  in the US. There's a death every day, it seems. It was over 300 last year and they taser you
[02:21.000 --> 02:28.000]  and you die. You're 25, 30 years old and you die right after the taser and they say it's not related.
[02:28.000 --> 02:34.000]  I mean, pretty soon they're going to sue medical examiners if they say that police guns, you know,
[02:34.000 --> 02:39.000]  when they shoot some guy in handcuffs 14 times in the back or in some cases like the LAPD have
[02:39.000 --> 02:43.000]  shot people with over 100 times the pieces that are unarmed, maybe they'll say they didn't die
[02:43.000 --> 02:52.000]  from gunshots. That's a conspiracy theory. So this is the otherworldly craziness that's happening.
[02:52.000 --> 02:58.000]  The truth is there are individuals who can get 25,000 volts through them. They're a smaller
[02:58.000 --> 03:03.000]  powered appliance and they'll have a heart attack and die when they're young. There are people who can
[03:03.000 --> 03:11.000]  take 100,000, 200,000, 300,000, 400,000 watts. There have been people that have been hit by 500,000 watts
[03:11.000 --> 03:17.000]  and lived. There are people that are struck by lightning, estimated to be at a million watts.
[03:17.000 --> 03:24.000]  But some people, and it's a goodly percentage, they've got studies on it, die when they get hit by
[03:24.000 --> 03:32.000]  20,000 watts. Well, tasers 50 to 60 have got a new model out with 70. And so, of course, it's killing
[03:32.000 --> 03:38.000]  people. Most of those that died are hit right in the chest where they're told to aim at people and the
[03:38.000 --> 03:44.000]  heart has a ganglia of complex nerves that control it. That's why a lot of people get pacemakers when
[03:44.000 --> 03:53.000]  they're older to control that ganglia, that nerve ganglia. And a nice jolt of that electricity runs
[03:53.000 --> 03:59.000]  through those and it turns off, just like the paddles, the defibrillators. They shock your heart
[03:59.000 --> 04:05.000]  back on. Well, you can shock someone's heart off with them. You shock someone with defibrillators
[04:05.000 --> 04:10.000]  whose heart is already going. You're either going to get a crazy, and I've seen the medical literature on
[04:10.000 --> 04:18.000]  this, a crazy heartbeat, or just as often the heart's going to stop. Then you got to shock it back on.
[04:18.000 --> 04:25.000]  Oh, my gosh, this is incredible. So now you're not supposed to, because they will sue you if you say it's
[04:25.000 --> 04:32.000]  killing people. Oh, no, they just taser somebody and they die. It's no relation. I guess next time a
[04:32.000 --> 04:36.000]  cop beats somebody and they have at the billy club and they die from the billy club, they'll say now,
[04:36.000 --> 04:43.000]  billy clubs don't beat brains out. Yeah, well, I'm here to tell you they do. All right, big news,
[04:43.000 --> 04:48.000]  tons of news, huge news, bullets on the dollar, what's happening with oil, it's all coming up right now.
[04:48.000 --> 04:49.000]  Stay with me.
[04:49.000 --> 05:03.000]  It is a big idea, a new world order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[05:03.000 --> 05:09.000]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group. Could their objective be world domination?
[05:09.000 --> 05:15.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[05:15.000 --> 05:24.000]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand. For the first time in history, the elite's
[05:24.000 --> 05:30.000]  plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire
[05:30.000 --> 05:32.000]  new world order agenda.
[05:32.000 --> 05:36.000]  Bilderberg is making great progress for the world government. Most people have no idea. They're not after money.
[05:36.000 --> 05:40.000]  They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their after these years.
[05:40.000 --> 05:48.000]  You're in-game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[05:48.000 --> 06:12.000]  We all know that knowledge is power. We've tried to give you knowledge to help you prepare for rough times.
[06:12.000 --> 06:21.000]  You know they're turning food into fuel with corn ethanol plants.
[06:21.000 --> 06:25.000]  If we do not control our food, food will be used to control us.
[06:25.000 --> 06:31.000]  Food control has been the plan historically in every enslaved population and is the plan for America.
[06:31.000 --> 06:37.000]  The only value of the knowledge you have to take control of your food is if you choose to get a supply
[06:37.000 --> 06:46.000]  while you still have the freedom to choose. Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[06:46.000 --> 06:53.000]  Call 800-409-5633.
[06:53.000 --> 06:57.000]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap or detergent?
[06:57.000 --> 07:02.000]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfate, sodium, formaldehydes and more?
[07:02.000 --> 07:08.000]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[07:08.000 --> 07:12.000]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives
[07:12.000 --> 07:19.000]  that can lead to coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin and mucous membranes.
[07:19.000 --> 07:25.000]  Now compare a cow bin pure soap, all natural, earth-friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[07:48.000 --> 08:01.000]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[08:18.000 --> 08:25.000]  This is the only country I've been in other than England where we all have the same corrupt systems
[08:25.000 --> 08:30.000]  where the police march up to you as you're peacefully videotaping at a park or in front of a government building
[08:30.000 --> 08:33.000]  and just say, turn your camera off. You're not allowed to videotape.
[08:33.000 --> 08:40.000]  I don't care who you are, what press, I'm putting you in a terror database and they push you in a terrorist database.
[08:40.000 --> 08:45.000]  And it doesn't matter where you are, police, just in this country march up and say, turn cameras off.
[08:45.000 --> 08:49.000]  Don't talk to people on the street. You don't talk, slave. You're under martial law.
[08:49.000 --> 08:52.000]  So I'm really looking forward to going to Virginia.
[08:52.000 --> 09:00.000]  And if the police come up to me and tell me, turn my cameras off on a sidewalk in Chantilly right outside D.C. in Virginia,
[09:00.000 --> 09:03.000]  covering Bilderberg, I'm not turning my cameras off.
[09:03.000 --> 09:14.000]  And I'll just give you a heads up. We're going to have a live web streaming over the cell phone system hooked into
[09:14.000 --> 09:21.000]  a wireless broadband system. We may have to go just to sell archiving to a remote scene.
[09:21.000 --> 09:26.000]  But that's land of the cowards home of the slaves. I mean, that's how far we've come.
[09:26.000 --> 09:31.000]  That I am guessing the police are going to march up and say, all right, you're not allowed to be on the sidewalk.
[09:31.000 --> 09:36.000]  You're not allowed to have cameras. You're not allowed to cover the secret elite of the world meeting in a hotel.
[09:36.000 --> 09:45.000]  125 presidents, prime ministers, Rothschild, Rockefellers, Queen of the Netherlands, U.S. government officials,
[09:45.000 --> 09:50.000]  violating federal law. You watch. They're going to say, because that's why our intel is telling us they're having it in the U.S.
[09:50.000 --> 09:56.000]  They used to only have it four years in a row in Europe than one year in North America.
[09:56.000 --> 10:02.000]  Now they had it in Canada. Then they had it in Istanbul, Turkey. Then they're having it back in the United States.
[10:02.000 --> 10:08.000]  And that's because, quote, there's a better media blackout in the U.S. Our press is so controlled that there will be no coverage.
[10:08.000 --> 10:14.000]  He doesn't exist. And our police are so third world.
[10:14.000 --> 10:20.000]  I mean, you can be in Nicaragua. You can be in El Salvador. And I've been there.
[10:20.000 --> 10:25.000]  You can have video cameras out filming whatever you want. You can be in Russia. You can be in Germany.
[10:25.000 --> 10:32.000]  You can be in communist China, to a great extent, only in the United States and England.
[10:32.000 --> 10:36.000]  Do they march up and say, there is no freedom. You are a slave.
[10:36.000 --> 10:42.000]  And they will immediately freak out, flip out and attack you with a deadly weapon, with a taser, if you don't submit.
[10:42.000 --> 10:45.000]  And that's fine. I've had enough of it.
[10:45.000 --> 10:53.000]  We're going to have cameras pre-placed, of course, 100 yards away or so to capture any of this in any attempted setups.
[10:53.000 --> 11:00.000]  Now, they make it, and I'm doing this as an attempt to let them do the right thing, to not give me a scene, to not give us an info war victory.
[11:00.000 --> 11:05.000]  It's a sting when you violate us, when you violate, when you try to decapitate the First Amendment,
[11:05.000 --> 11:09.000]  when you savagely attack the founding fathers with a double-edged dagger at their heart.
[11:09.000 --> 11:17.000]  And that's what this is, when you viciously attack what our veterans have fought and died for, when you viciously attack freedom with hatred and avarice.
[11:17.000 --> 11:26.000]  We hope you don't do that. But I am going to Virginia, and I am going to cover the Bilderberg group, the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th.
[11:26.000 --> 11:30.000]  And I want to see everybody out there. It really kicks out on the, kicks off on the 6th.
[11:30.000 --> 11:38.000]  We need to see big crowds there. And, you know, they may back off, they may leave us alone, they may try to set up a free speech zone.
[11:38.000 --> 11:45.000]  But if it's 10 or 15 of us, especially in Virginia and D.C. surrounding area, there in the District of Criminals,
[11:45.000 --> 11:49.000]  they will attack us. They are some of the worst police in the country.
[11:49.000 --> 11:55.000]  Are in Chantilly, there's been events there before, we know. Some of the worst in the country are in D.C.
[11:55.000 --> 12:03.000]  And it doesn't matter. You're not going to attack my country. You're not going to turn this into a third-world death squad run scum-filled system.
[12:03.000 --> 12:06.000]  And so we're going there to defend the First Amendment more than anything.
[12:06.000 --> 12:09.000]  You can go to Istanbul, Turkey, and videotape the Bilderberg meeting.
[12:09.000 --> 12:15.000]  And the cops leave you alone and are respectful and polite. Supposedly an incredible police state.
[12:15.000 --> 12:19.000]  You can go to Japan and do it. You can go anywhere because they know the press.
[12:19.000 --> 12:24.000]  People with cameras have a right to cover events. But only in America is it so incredible.
[12:24.000 --> 12:31.000]  You want to come with a global elite meeting and you want a videotape. How dare you, criminal?
[12:31.000 --> 12:35.000]  Right here in Austin, you can be out videotaping an event with the governor at it on the sidewalk.
[12:35.000 --> 12:40.000]  And they'll walk up and say, leave. And you'll say, no. And they'll say, okay, we're going to arrest you.
[12:40.000 --> 12:51.000]  And you have to say, you know, I'm going to have to sue you personally. You're trying to violate my freedom, my bill of rights, my Constitution. How dare you?
[12:51.000 --> 12:57.000]  I had to do that. It's all on video. It's on the web.
[12:57.000 --> 13:13.000]  I don't want to get off into Iran. I was just thinking last night how I've got a face down and I've got to deal with almost certain harassment, a paramilitary third world enforcing goons who are stabbing my country in the heart with full power.
[13:13.000 --> 13:21.000]  I mean, that's what it is. They are assaulting the republic. And I'm disgusted. I don't want to go be around you.
[13:21.000 --> 13:33.000]  I don't want to go have to face you down. I don't enjoy it. I don't enjoy the fact I have to put my body in the way of your fist.
[13:33.000 --> 13:38.000]  I don't like it. But I have to do it in the battle for the republic.
[13:38.000 --> 13:43.000]  Alright, I've already died grass, ladies and gentlemen.
[13:43.000 --> 13:52.000]  Let me give you the news we've got here today. Oil climbs the record above 135. That's right. It was all-time record yesterday at 130. Now, 135.
[13:52.000 --> 14:05.000]  Now, watch. It's going to drop now back to about 125. I'm predicting. Then it'll surge back to 140. Then it'll drop to 130. Always a psychology of, hey, at least it's not 140 a barrel. It's only 125.
[14:05.000 --> 14:16.000]  And it'll probably peak out at 145, 150 by July, middle of July, end of July. It'll settle back down to 125 a barrel.
[14:16.000 --> 14:23.000]  But then, by the next summer, I predict $200 a barrel of oil. Of course, we've been telling you this for over two years with our inside sources.
[14:23.000 --> 14:33.000]  They are training you. They are indoctrinating you. They are enslaving you. Your journey towards despotic enslavement is now very close to being complete.
[14:33.000 --> 14:45.000]  Oil climbs the record above 135. No one will say in our controlled whore press so hoared out that globalists come here to meet now because Europe has to to free a press.
[14:45.000 --> 14:55.000]  And you will hear nowhere that it is 90% of it's the dollar. You'll have grandstanding by Congress blaming oil companies, which are subsidiaries of the New World Order,
[14:55.000 --> 15:03.000]  and are making their seven to 9% a year and are making record profits, but that's their set profit.
[15:03.000 --> 15:13.000]  They are intermediaries. OPEC is an intermediary. This is all dollar devaluation. People now want it to be undenominated.
[15:13.000 --> 15:25.000]  Oh, try $300 a barrel. $400, $500, $600, $700, $800, $900. You know about pesos being devalued. You know about roubles being devalued.
[15:25.000 --> 15:31.000]  You better find out about dollars being devalued. A lot of you out there think you're richy rich because you're worth a million bucks.
[15:31.000 --> 15:37.000]  This isn't a millionaire 100 years ago or 50 years ago or 30 years ago or five years ago.
[15:37.000 --> 15:43.000]  I mean, having a million bucks five years ago is like having $100,000 30 years ago.
[15:43.000 --> 15:47.000]  But now having a million bucks is like having 50,000 bucks 20 years ago.
[15:47.000 --> 15:54.000]  I mean, it's all allusion. But you want allusion? You want allusion? Fine, enjoy it.
[15:54.000 --> 16:03.000]  Oil climbs the record above 135. Squawkbock, a top analyst says, $12 to $15 a gallon gas. Well, why stop there?
[16:03.000 --> 16:10.000]  It's not $200 a gallon gas. I mean, you know, it's so sick.
[16:10.000 --> 16:18.000]  And the average yuppie, the average know it all there. I hear them on talk radio and calling you and they have no idea it's the dollar.
[16:18.000 --> 16:26.000]  Big oil defends profit before irate senators. These whore senators know exactly what they're doing.
[16:26.000 --> 16:30.000]  They have a lot more to do with this and I'm not defending the oil companies.
[16:30.000 --> 16:35.000]  But they're like a big toe, whereas the central banks of the brain.
[16:35.000 --> 16:42.000]  Big oil defends profit before irate senators. Oil smashes 135 Asia trade on supply concerns.
[16:42.000 --> 16:49.000]  That's why gold has shot up over $100, dropped down $56, now shooting back up.
[16:49.000 --> 16:58.000]  I mean, they've dumped hundreds of billions this year in the last four months openly of IMF World Bank gold market and they can't suppress it.
[16:58.000 --> 17:07.000]  Gold was 300 bucks five years ago.
[17:07.000 --> 17:12.000]  So I am not going to sit here and belabor this all day with everybody.
[17:12.000 --> 17:20.000]  It's just that we are in the middle of a full scale, absolute economic implosion.
[17:20.000 --> 17:28.000]  And it is going to be five years in the scale of human development is a twinkling of an eye, not even a blink of an eye.
[17:28.000 --> 17:39.000]  It is a millisecond parsec. I mean, it is just a tiny piece of a millisecond and it is a fraction of a millisecond.
[17:39.000 --> 17:51.000]  And in the next three years, we are just going to see riots in the streets, sound cannons, microwave guns, mindless idiots that only want to feel powerful.
[17:51.000 --> 17:53.000]  And it's like they're hunters.
[17:53.000 --> 18:12.000]  So instead of going out and hunting a bear with a spear like real hunters used to do, they hunt men and they hunt domesticated, cowardly, dumbed down, poisoned, poor, pathetic, radiated slaves running, looking from side to side in an absolutely emasculated fashion.
[18:12.000 --> 18:21.000]  Just just going, I mean, that's real manly, pulling families over, snatching people's kids, social workers.
[18:21.000 --> 18:27.000]  I know it was a social worker yesterday. I was driving through Westlake Hills on business and I was like stuck in traffic.
[18:27.000 --> 18:35.000]  And then right next to me in the other lane, killing the other way for about a minute was this, was this the ninning chicken necked.
[18:35.000 --> 18:43.000]  Well, Jackson, giant jowl. He was just looking at me with pure hatred and with the car he was driving and what he looked like, guaranteed it was CPS.
[18:43.000 --> 18:46.000]  And the guy was just looking at me, trying to intimidate me.
[18:46.000 --> 18:54.000]  And I just went and I turned away not because I couldn't look at your gaze, but I don't like go around staring at like my dog vomits on the back porch.
[18:54.000 --> 18:57.000]  I don't like really looking at it. I just cleaned it up or spray off the water hose.
[18:57.000 --> 19:02.000]  I mean, I don't think I turned away because I couldn't handle your big intimidating demon look.
[19:02.000 --> 19:11.000]  It was that I just, it's like a, I see a, you know, if I got to drag a dead horse out with a tractor and it's been dead for a week with maggots and bloated guts and animals have been eating on it.
[19:11.000 --> 19:15.000]  I don't stare at it. I just go up, tie a chain to its legs and pull it into a ditch.
[19:15.000 --> 19:17.000]  Out of the road.
[19:17.000 --> 19:21.000]  And so just, you know, but I saw you, I saw you. It was very demonic.
[19:21.000 --> 19:31.000]  Oh, you're going to pay in the end. Don't you worry, you trash, you disgusting, weak filth that just enjoys abusing innocent people.
[19:31.000 --> 19:34.000]  Everything you got is going to be taken scumbag.
[19:34.000 --> 19:37.000]  So enjoy your holiday of evil.
[19:37.000 --> 19:39.000]  You're the ones that are going to pay in the end.
[19:39.000 --> 19:41.000]  You're going to be hit the hardest.
[19:41.000 --> 19:55.000]  And we're going to take this country back in this world back and those of you who survive what's coming are going to swing high on the end of a rope after you've been given full due process, full due process.

[21:54.000 --> 21:58.000]  Hello, I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 15 books on health and natural healing.
[21:58.000 --> 22:02.000]  Vaccines included, medicines kill more people every year than any illness.
[22:02.000 --> 22:06.000]  The cost of drug side effects in America is more than $200 billion annually,
[22:06.000 --> 22:09.000]  with the worst toll taken by antibiotics.
[22:09.000 --> 22:12.000]  But there is a cure for this medical madness that has remained secret.
[22:12.000 --> 22:16.000]  Oxysilver, developed by NASA scientists to keep astronauts healthy,
[22:16.000 --> 22:21.000]  is an evolutionary new dietary supplement making deadly vaccinations and antibiotics obsolete.
[22:21.000 --> 22:26.000]  Taking one to two teaspoons daily boosts natural immunity without drug toxicity.
[22:26.000 --> 22:29.000]  Oxysilver combines oxygen and silver in a new way.
[22:29.000 --> 22:34.000]  The oxygen becomes a supercharged germ killer freeing your immune system to fight colds,
[22:34.000 --> 22:36.000]  flus, cancers, and more.

[23:49.000 --> 24:07.000]  Call now while operators are standing by to receive your call.
[24:07.000 --> 24:27.000]  A lot of thugs think the tyranny's cute and fun.
[24:27.000 --> 24:35.000]  They're going to all find out just how fun it is.
[24:35.000 --> 24:40.000]  They have your once free nation destroyed, overrun by third-world populations.
[24:40.000 --> 24:45.000]  But I guess we're a nation of trash and cowards is what we deserve.
[24:45.000 --> 24:52.000]  Yeah, we're the biggest Tattletale nation in the world, grandparents turning in their grandchildren from marijuana for 500 bucks.
[24:52.000 --> 24:55.000]  New York Times, a nation of snitches. Does that mean we're all scum? No.
[24:55.000 --> 25:00.000]  But we have come from the greatest country into the most decadent, wicked country.
[25:00.000 --> 25:05.000]  If you read the Bible and history, that always happened to upright nations. They always became spoiled and evil.
[25:05.000 --> 25:09.000]  And I'm sad this is happening. Oil climbs above 135. That's a commodity.
[25:09.000 --> 25:11.000]  That's why gold is exploding right now.
[25:11.000 --> 25:17.000]  Ted has gold prices locked in at last week's prices and silver, which are both up massively.
[25:17.000 --> 25:20.000]  Gold up over 100. Silver up over $2.
[25:20.000 --> 25:27.000]  And I would use this as a buying opportunity because it's only going to go up in the midterm by that the next six months to a year.
[25:27.000 --> 25:32.000]  I mean, how could it not? Every commodity is exploding. The dollar is devaluing.
[25:32.000 --> 25:38.000]  I want to bring Ted Anderson up for a few minutes. I'm going to play some clips coming up about what's happening on the economy afterwards.
[25:38.000 --> 25:41.000]  Ted, just real fast. Tell me about the offer you've got.
[25:41.000 --> 25:50.000]  Well, real quick, we have the Walking Liberty Half Rolls. That's one of my favorites right now because of the fact that silver just broke through $18 an ounce.
[25:50.000 --> 26:00.000]  So yesterday it was just poking towards $18. Now it's seen $18.10. Those silver dollars, or I'm sorry, the Walking Liberty Halfs were trading for $205.
[26:00.000 --> 26:10.000]  Last time I was at this level, right now I have them at $182. And the reason why they're at $182 is because I locked them in back when silver was at $1650.
[26:10.000 --> 26:12.000]  Now I also have the...
[26:12.000 --> 26:14.000]  So that's $182 for how many?
[26:14.000 --> 26:17.000]  $182. Roll of $20. Sorry about that. It's a roll of $20.
[26:17.000 --> 26:19.000]  So Ted, are you selling this at below spot?
[26:19.000 --> 26:26.000]  Well, the spot is just approaching right where the price... If you put two of them together, $1 face value...
[26:26.000 --> 26:33.000]  Okay, so basically you're getting high quality silver that's really hard to get a hold of right at spot and tell them about the gold.
[26:33.000 --> 26:38.000]  Well, not as really hard to get a hold of, Alex. I couldn't sell these three weeks ago. I'm sorry, three months ago.
[26:38.000 --> 26:44.000]  Gold right now, the best thing I have in gold right now with hands down is the Frank coin. It's at $199.
[26:44.000 --> 26:51.000]  Gold, again, is trading in the $900s now. It's seen a high today of $928.50.
[26:51.000 --> 26:57.000]  And we're just approaching that $1,000 mark again. There's no way you're going to be able to buy a coin like this at that price.
[26:57.000 --> 27:07.000]  Bottom line, I don't know when it's going to happen, but you can have $135 barrel oil. Analysts conservatively talking about $6 a gallon gas on average.
[27:07.000 --> 27:12.000]  Some are talking about $14. The dollar is imploding, but you'll never hear it on the news
[27:12.000 --> 27:17.000]  when it's absolute headlines all over the world with everyone panicking, dumping dollars.
[27:17.000 --> 27:25.000]  And we are such a dumbed down population that literally, I hear financial shows nationally, locally, they won't tell people, Ted, and they know.
[27:25.000 --> 27:31.000]  Yeah, they won't tell people because they're afraid of what will happen. They're afraid of losing their customers.
[27:31.000 --> 27:34.000]  They don't want to talk about what's really going on.
[27:34.000 --> 27:42.000]  The stock market is an absolute fraud, folks. The top 30 winners are at $12,000, and that's what the dollar devalued by 60% or more.
[27:42.000 --> 27:48.000]  I mean, that suckers down at $5,000 now. I mean, this is red level. Ted, given the number, they can't beat that deal.
[27:48.000 --> 27:56.000]  Yeah, 1-800-686-2237. Again, the number is 1-800-686-2237.
[27:56.000 --> 28:05.000]  Secure your position. If you have money in the stocks, if you're sitting in the bank, if you have your money denominated in U.S. dollar, folks, you've got to do something.
[28:05.000 --> 28:11.000]  You really need to do something about your portfolio. It is going to go down.
[28:11.000 --> 28:26.000]  1-800-686-2237. Ted, mainline analysts are talking about $12 to $14 a gallon gas. That means that they think the dollar is going to go down to like 5% of its value 5, 6 years ago.
[28:26.000 --> 28:33.000]  I mean, that's what Ron Paul says. He says once it starts racing down, that's what all these other analysts say.
[28:33.000 --> 28:36.000]  We need to get Bob Chapman on it. Keep forgetting to get him on this week.
[28:36.000 --> 28:43.000]  Alex, every time the United States has a problem, they start printing money. They just turn on the printing presses, and that's what's causing the problem.
[28:43.000 --> 28:50.000]  So it's compounding. It'll be like trying to drink from a fire hose by the time they get done printing.
[28:50.000 --> 28:56.000]  By the way, ladies and gentlemen, I've got a little bit of money in the bank savings. I want to start this TV network, which I'm just going to dump it on.
[28:56.000 --> 29:07.000]  And why have I decided to just spend a little bit of capital I've got as an emergency backup? Because it won't be worth anything in a year or two anyways. It's a massively devaluing asset right now.
[29:07.000 --> 29:12.000]  And so if you're not putting it into a business, because again, this isn't even a business, because our model isn't a business.
[29:12.000 --> 29:19.000]  It's fight the new world order. But why have I decided to blow our emergency fuel? Because it's being dissipated anyways.
[29:19.000 --> 29:26.000]  My fuel tanks have holes in it, so I might as well go ahead and burn it in my engines to get to my destination before it runs out the fuel tanks.
[29:26.000 --> 29:35.000]  So I'm throttling the engines up to full blowout capacity. 1-800-686-2237. Mayday, the United States is completely financially imploding.
[29:35.000 --> 29:41.000]  1-800-686-2237. Carl, get the gold. Get the silver right now. You can't beat those deals. Ted, thanks for coming on.
[29:41.000 --> 29:43.000]  Yeah, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[29:43.000 --> 29:45.000]  You bet. We'll be right back.
[29:45.000 --> 29:52.000]  In the March, the Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:15.000 --> 30:21.000]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die. With laced med inks, patented methodology.
[30:21.000 --> 30:32.000]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.

[30:54.000 --> 30:58.000]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[30:58.000 --> 31:03.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[31:03.000 --> 31:06.000]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[31:06.000 --> 31:09.000]  Could their objective be world domination?
[31:09.000 --> 31:12.000]  For thousands of years, their Dark Order grew.
[31:12.000 --> 31:22.000]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[31:22.000 --> 31:28.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[31:28.000 --> 31:32.000]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[31:32.000 --> 31:35.000]  Build America is making great progress for the world government.
[31:35.000 --> 31:38.000]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need.
[31:38.000 --> 31:40.000]  They're after power. That's their affidavit.

[33:11.000 --> 33:14.000]  We've been talking all morning long about energy prices.
[33:14.000 --> 33:18.000]  Watching crude oil prices touch above $127 for the first time overnight
[33:18.000 --> 33:22.000]  leads a lot of people to start wondering about peak oil and the peak oil theory.
[33:22.000 --> 33:26.000]  You've been writing about peak oil for some time, so did you see this coming?
[33:26.000 --> 33:34.000]  Yes, we did. Not quite the way it's turned out, but this is not a surprise.
[33:34.000 --> 33:36.000]  You say it's not quite the way it's turned out.
[33:36.000 --> 33:39.000]  What's happened that's different than you were predicting?
[33:39.000 --> 33:41.000]  Well, I wasn't particularly predicting.
[33:41.000 --> 33:47.000]  I'm a student of this and have focused on what we do about the problem after it really hits.
[33:47.000 --> 33:55.000]  Peak oil has a, the idea is that it would hit a sharp peak,
[33:55.000 --> 33:59.000]  and then production in the world would hit a sharp peak, and then drop off.
[33:59.000 --> 34:03.000]  And what's happened is that we've hit a plateau in world oil production,
[34:03.000 --> 34:09.000]  and that plateau has been ongoing since about the middle of 2004.
[34:09.000 --> 34:12.000]  Dr. Herster, a lot of people, when we talk about peak oil,
[34:12.000 --> 34:16.000]  who say there are going to be new technologies that are always developed,
[34:16.000 --> 34:21.000]  there will be new ways to get oil, whether it's from coal, whether it's from the oil shales,
[34:21.000 --> 34:24.000]  and they say that that means we will never actually hit peak oil.
[34:24.000 --> 34:26.000]  What do you say to those people?
[34:26.000 --> 34:34.000]  They're incorrect, and the reason that they're incorrect is that they don't understand the magnitude of the problem
[34:34.000 --> 34:38.000]  and how long it's going to take to bring substitute liquid fuels on
[34:38.000 --> 34:43.000]  and to introduce energy efficiency on a massive scale.
[34:43.000 --> 34:46.000]  That's something that we analyzed, and it takes decades,
[34:46.000 --> 34:51.000]  and the reason simply is that the magnitude of the problem is enormous.
[34:51.000 --> 34:56.000]  Bob, I know you are not an oil expert, so I'm not going to try and pin you down on peak oil theory,
[34:56.000 --> 34:59.000]  but clearly inflation is something that consumers are struggling with.
[34:59.000 --> 35:04.000]  As we watch these higher prices at the pump, you said yourself you paid almost $4 a gallon
[35:04.000 --> 35:06.000]  for filling up your car yesterday.
[35:06.000 --> 35:08.000]  Do you think inflation like this continues?
[35:08.000 --> 35:12.000]  If we have hit some sort of limits, does oil continue to climb?
[35:12.000 --> 35:17.000]  I think the oil price has a good bit of bubble in it.
[35:17.000 --> 35:21.000]  I can't imagine it staying at this level permanently.
[35:21.000 --> 35:24.000]  I think it'll go down a little and eventually go back up.
[35:24.000 --> 35:28.000]  On what to do about it, I think I'm going to go to the office after this,
[35:28.000 --> 35:31.000]  and I'm going to write a forward blog posting.
[35:31.000 --> 35:35.000]  It's going to say, drill more, pay less.
[35:35.000 --> 35:39.000]  While we're waiting on alternative fuels,
[35:39.000 --> 35:44.000]  it's silly for us to put so many places off limits to drilling
[35:44.000 --> 35:50.000]  while countries like Brazil can go out there and just do it and hit it big.
[35:50.000 --> 35:52.000]  We ought to be drilling more.
[35:52.000 --> 35:54.000]  Dr. Hirsch, what do you say to that?
[35:54.000 --> 35:57.000]  The idea that we should be drilling in places like Anwar and drilling offshore,
[35:57.000 --> 36:01.000]  would that solve this problem of a plateau in oil production?
[36:01.000 --> 36:04.000]  There's no single thing that's going to solve this problem
[36:04.000 --> 36:08.000]  because it's as massive as one can possibly imagine.
[36:08.000 --> 36:11.000]  The prices that we're paying at the pump today,
[36:11.000 --> 36:13.000]  I think, are going to be the good old days
[36:13.000 --> 36:18.000]  because others who watch this very closely forecast
[36:18.000 --> 36:21.000]  that we're going to be hitting $12 and $15 per gallon.
[36:21.000 --> 36:22.000]  All right.
[36:22.000 --> 36:25.000]  And then after that, when oil, world oil production.
[36:25.000 --> 36:28.000]  That is the biggest bunch of bull you're ever going to hear in your life.
[36:28.000 --> 36:32.000]  Now, the host let out the little dirty secret that you never hear on these shows.
[36:32.000 --> 36:33.000]  That was quite an interview.
[36:33.000 --> 36:34.000]  It goes on.
[36:34.000 --> 36:37.000]  It's up on infowars.com and prisonpond.com right now.
[36:37.000 --> 36:39.000]  The rest of it.
[36:39.000 --> 36:42.000]  Inflation.
[36:42.000 --> 36:45.000]  They are paying for adjusted US dollars.
[36:45.000 --> 36:48.000]  That's even with the value dollars.
[36:48.000 --> 36:53.000]  15 to 16 cents in Venezuela, 22 cents in Brazil.
[36:53.000 --> 36:57.000]  They are paying about 45 cents a gallon in Mexico,
[36:57.000 --> 37:01.000]  just like they get prescription drugs for five times cheaper.
[37:01.000 --> 37:03.000]  We're the schmucks.
[37:03.000 --> 37:05.000]  We're known as being idiots.
[37:05.000 --> 37:08.000]  We're known as thinking we know it all.
[37:08.000 --> 37:11.000]  We're known as the international sucker,
[37:11.000 --> 37:15.000]  just like whalers 150 years ago, 200 years ago,
[37:15.000 --> 37:17.000]  called the right whale, the right whale,
[37:17.000 --> 37:20.000]  because they were sweet, friendly whales
[37:20.000 --> 37:21.000]  that even though you'd be killing them,
[37:21.000 --> 37:23.000]  they'd come up friendly to your boat.
[37:23.000 --> 37:26.000]  Whereas a sperm whale would attack your smaller boats
[37:26.000 --> 37:27.000]  and would kill people.
[37:27.000 --> 37:30.000]  And other whales would froth and resist.
[37:30.000 --> 37:32.000]  So it was known as the right whale.
[37:32.000 --> 37:35.000]  The right one because it's the one to attack.
[37:35.000 --> 37:37.000]  It's the good one.
[37:37.000 --> 37:40.000]  That was the term for being right means doing the right thing.
[37:40.000 --> 37:43.000]  Being the one you want, the right woman for me,
[37:43.000 --> 37:46.000]  the right house, the right car, the right whale.
[37:46.000 --> 37:49.000]  We are the right whale, ladies and gentlemen.
[37:49.000 --> 37:51.000]  Make no mistake.
[37:51.000 --> 37:55.000]  We are the most imprisoned, stupidest, most unhealthy,
[37:55.000 --> 37:58.000]  most arrogant, know-it-all group ever.
[37:58.000 --> 38:01.000]  And that's why you're not going to escape corrupt government people.
[38:01.000 --> 38:03.000]  You're going to pay all that money for gas,
[38:03.000 --> 38:05.000]  and you're going to lose your standard of living too.
[38:05.000 --> 38:06.000]  It doesn't matter though.
[38:06.000 --> 38:08.000]  You'll still get to put black masks on.
[38:08.000 --> 38:10.000]  That's all that matters.
[38:10.000 --> 38:12.000]  And so you hear that guy.
[38:12.000 --> 38:14.000]  Now, I told you four or five years ago,
[38:14.000 --> 38:16.000]  Paul Watson wrote articles four or five years ago,
[38:16.000 --> 38:17.000]  two years ago, three years ago,
[38:17.000 --> 38:20.000]  about how they would tell you you were going to pay more,
[38:20.000 --> 38:23.000]  not because of inflation, but just, oh, it's peak oil.
[38:23.000 --> 38:24.000]  How do we know that?
[38:24.000 --> 38:26.000]  Because the big oil companies,
[38:26.000 --> 38:28.000]  let's talk about what they have done.
[38:28.000 --> 38:36.000]  They bought up over 100 of the over 200 plus refineries,
[38:36.000 --> 38:39.000]  Associated Press, 2,000, got all the documents,
[38:39.000 --> 38:41.000]  and where they was the top 10 oil companies,
[38:41.000 --> 38:43.000]  bought up the refineries and shut them down,
[38:43.000 --> 38:46.000]  created an artificial bottleneck.
[38:46.000 --> 38:49.000]  But the main reason is because the dollar's been devalued.
[38:49.000 --> 38:51.000]  There is no shortage of oil.
[38:51.000 --> 38:53.000]  The dollar has been devalued.
[38:53.000 --> 38:57.000]  Every time the dollar goes down, oil goes up.
[38:57.000 --> 39:00.000]  It has nothing to do with peak oil.
[39:00.000 --> 39:02.000]  You can drill almost anywhere in East Texas
[39:02.000 --> 39:03.000]  or West Texas and hit oil.
[39:03.000 --> 39:05.000]  The old oil wells have filled back up.
[39:05.000 --> 39:10.000]  One field in Anwar has more than half of Saudi Arabia.
[39:10.000 --> 39:14.000]  They estimate that all of Alaska has many times more than Saudi Arabia.
[39:14.000 --> 39:16.000]  Discoverable, usable, deliverable.
[39:16.000 --> 39:21.000]  Now, 90 plus percent of the Gulf of Mexico is off limits.
[39:21.000 --> 39:25.000]  You drill anywhere you hit natural gas and oil.
[39:25.000 --> 39:28.000]  Most of my family works at every level of oil
[39:28.000 --> 39:30.000]  or has worked at every level of oil.
[39:30.000 --> 39:33.000]  It is a fraud and a sick joke.
[39:33.000 --> 39:35.000]  But you tell the idiot public that,
[39:35.000 --> 39:37.000]  oh, it's because there's no more oil.
[39:37.000 --> 39:38.000]  They'll believe it.
[39:38.000 --> 39:39.000]  Oh, there's no more oil.
[39:39.000 --> 39:41.000]  That's why they're paying 15 cents in Venezuela,
[39:41.000 --> 39:44.000]  20-something cents in Brazil.
[39:44.000 --> 39:47.000]  That's why they're paying 40 cents in Russia,
[39:47.000 --> 39:50.000]  44, 45 cents in Mexico.
[39:50.000 --> 39:53.000]  No, it's because we are the idiots.
[39:53.000 --> 39:57.000]  That's why. Okay, period.
[39:57.000 --> 39:59.000]  Now, I'm not going to spend long on this.
[39:59.000 --> 40:01.000]  I'm going to have him back up for like 30, 40 minutes next week
[40:01.000 --> 40:03.000]  and then on Friday for an hour.
[40:03.000 --> 40:07.000]  Because one of the staff at Genesis,
[40:07.000 --> 40:13.000]  Kristen Davies, great lady, great webmaster for GCNLive.com,
[40:13.000 --> 40:16.000]  will tell you about her own police state adventure
[40:16.000 --> 40:18.000]  before Tommy Chung joins us.
[40:18.000 --> 40:22.000]  And just so you know what the public schools are,
[40:22.000 --> 40:24.000]  she's standing by in the next five, six minutes.
[40:24.000 --> 40:28.000]  But I want to go to Eric Nordstrom.
[40:28.000 --> 40:30.000]  He's the fellow that originally came up with the idea
[40:30.000 --> 40:32.000]  to put it on the web to do a money bomb.
[40:32.000 --> 40:36.000]  The idea itself was developed by a jazz musician in New York.
[40:36.000 --> 40:38.000]  Then it got picked up by others.
[40:38.000 --> 40:40.000]  But he put up a money bomb a few weeks ago.
[40:40.000 --> 40:46.000]  It's at $57,000. People have pledged to donate.
[40:46.000 --> 40:51.000]  We're going to have a 1-800 line that's posted in a couple days.
[40:51.000 --> 40:52.000]  We're going to have my PayPal.
[40:52.000 --> 40:53.000]  Yes, it's going to be my PayPal.
[40:53.000 --> 40:54.000]  People keep asking, is this you?
[40:54.000 --> 40:56.000]  Well, I didn't come up with the idea,
[40:56.000 --> 40:58.000]  but yes, it's going to be a link from their site to a page
[40:58.000 --> 41:01.000]  on my site that has our PayPal.
[41:01.000 --> 41:03.000]  We'll donate there or call the credit card.
[41:03.000 --> 41:06.000]  Or you can mail now and we'll add it to the money bomb
[41:06.000 --> 41:08.000]  for next Friday and next Saturday.
[41:08.000 --> 41:10.000]  I think we ought to start the money bomb in the afternoon on Friday.
[41:10.000 --> 41:11.000]  Have it go for a day and a half.
[41:11.000 --> 41:12.000]  That's my opinion.
[41:12.000 --> 41:15.000]  And really try to see how much we can get in there.
[41:15.000 --> 41:18.000]  Not my idea, but frankly, I need to spend capital on better cameras,
[41:18.000 --> 41:20.000]  better equipment, bigger office.
[41:20.000 --> 41:23.000]  And I mean, we were here working until one o'clock last night
[41:23.000 --> 41:28.000]  and Burma's and Aaron and everybody else got here about 30 minutes ago.
[41:28.000 --> 41:29.000]  And I left at one.
[41:29.000 --> 41:30.000]  I don't know how late they were here.
[41:30.000 --> 41:32.000]  Hey, how late were you guys here?
[41:32.000 --> 41:33.000]  Two.
[41:33.000 --> 41:37.000]  Everybody left at two and Rob was back here 30 minutes ago.
[41:37.000 --> 41:39.000]  And so, I mean, I need to hire people.
[41:39.000 --> 41:43.000]  I mean, we are literally like horses in the Pony Express
[41:43.000 --> 41:47.000]  that don't change horses after a 40 mile run.
[41:47.000 --> 41:49.000]  I mean, it's just totally maxed out to the edge.
[41:49.000 --> 41:51.000]  I don't have money to hire more employees.
[41:51.000 --> 41:52.000]  I'm just so dedicated.
[41:52.000 --> 41:54.000]  I just keep fighting and fighting.
[41:54.000 --> 41:56.000]  And we need personnel.
[41:56.000 --> 41:59.000]  You know, when three of us leave and go to Virginia,
[41:59.000 --> 42:02.000]  there are many people left in the areas they're in, in this office.
[42:02.000 --> 42:05.000]  Because my camera men are also my editors.
[42:05.000 --> 42:07.000]  And please don't flood me with 100 things to come work for us.
[42:07.000 --> 42:08.000]  We don't have the money to pay you yet.
[42:08.000 --> 42:11.000]  We don't have the office to put volunteers in yet.
[42:11.000 --> 42:15.000]  So going to Eric Nordstrom, Eric started to have you holding this whole oil,
[42:15.000 --> 42:19.000]  fraud thing exactly as we predicted is now unfolding and the dollars
[42:19.000 --> 42:23.000]  plunging and oils exploding and total insanity is going on.
[42:23.000 --> 42:27.000]  But the money bomb, I mean, I want to see hundreds of thousands come in.
[42:27.000 --> 42:29.000]  Also, I had a question for you.
[42:29.000 --> 42:33.000]  You had up there, we want to get thousands of people to pledge $100.
[42:33.000 --> 42:36.000]  How many of those pledges, a lot of those are pledging to get 5, 10,
[42:36.000 --> 42:38.000]  20, 50, not 100.
[42:38.000 --> 42:42.000]  So it's probably really less than 50,000 or what does that graph there
[42:42.000 --> 42:44.000]  at the bottom represent?
[42:44.000 --> 42:48.000]  Well, originally when we started doing the money bomb for Ron Paul,
[42:48.000 --> 42:51.000]  we had set certain goals that we would like to reach.
[42:51.000 --> 42:56.000]  And our basic theory was if we aim for the stars and hit the moon, we're golden.
[42:56.000 --> 42:59.000]  So you got to have something to start the ball out with.
[42:59.000 --> 43:00.000]  We put it up.
[43:00.000 --> 43:04.000]  I've taken it down now because we've got some momentum on it.
[43:04.000 --> 43:09.000]  But as far as the little graph thing goes, as people pledge and put their email in,
[43:09.000 --> 43:13.000]  all I'm using that for is a head count and also to remind people
[43:13.000 --> 43:16.000]  that the money bomb is going on, say, a couple of days before
[43:16.000 --> 43:18.000]  and distribute certain information.
[43:18.000 --> 43:21.000]  But it's kind of a general head count to how many people have shown interest.
[43:21.000 --> 43:24.000]  They may or may not be putting in $100.
[43:24.000 --> 43:30.000]  The estimate right now is about 51,000 dollars based on that 100.
[43:30.000 --> 43:35.000]  But in all of these things, you have about probably a good 30% of the people
[43:35.000 --> 43:38.000]  who will wind up donating don't put in their email address.
[43:38.000 --> 43:41.000]  They don't show up on the head count.
[43:41.000 --> 43:45.000]  And I'm also getting a lot of people who are wanting to pledge
[43:45.000 --> 43:47.000]  that I'm just getting pure emails from.
[43:47.000 --> 43:49.000]  Let's say that they want to send a check-in.
[43:49.000 --> 43:53.000]  I've probably had a good 150 people email me asking me what's the address
[43:53.000 --> 43:56.000]  to send a check-in because they didn't want to use a credit card.
[43:56.000 --> 44:00.000]  So it's just basically kind of a roundabout estimate
[44:00.000 --> 44:02.000]  for how much interest has been put into it.
[44:02.000 --> 44:06.000]  And I'm trying to be conservative with it.
[44:06.000 --> 44:09.000]  I don't want to give you any hopes up, but I'm 99% sure
[44:09.000 --> 44:13.000]  that it's going to be well over 51,000 dollars just today.
[44:13.000 --> 44:18.000]  Basically, I've got a head count of about 517 people that have put their information
[44:18.000 --> 44:20.000]  in the email little widget there.
[44:20.000 --> 44:25.000]  But there's probably a whole lot more out there that just don't want to deal
[44:25.000 --> 44:26.000]  with the credit card.
[44:26.000 --> 44:30.000]  They don't want to put their email address in my website because they just...
[44:30.000 --> 44:31.000]  Well, that's very exciting.
[44:31.000 --> 44:34.000]  I haven't given you much guidance in the few things I've told you.
[44:34.000 --> 44:35.000]  You've done.
[44:35.000 --> 44:36.000]  The site looks great.
[44:36.000 --> 44:38.000]  I can only commend you, Mr. Nordstrom.
[44:38.000 --> 44:42.000]  But yeah, maybe we should just go ahead and put my 3001 South Lamar address up
[44:42.000 --> 44:47.000]  and say, if you want to mail it here, we will account for it Saturday live
[44:47.000 --> 44:48.000]  and put it up.
[44:48.000 --> 44:52.000]  I'm planning to come in Saturday during the money bomb
[44:52.000 --> 44:55.000]  and I'm planning to do a Saturday show.
[44:55.000 --> 44:58.000]  If the network wants to carry it, that's fine.
[44:58.000 --> 45:00.000]  But I'm going to do a Saturday show.
[45:00.000 --> 45:07.000]  I think the best time to do it would probably be in the evening.
[45:07.000 --> 45:20.000]  So maybe like five to eight or something to do a Saturday evening money bomb show.
[45:20.000 --> 45:26.000]  Burmese is in here playing with the studio equipment and that's going over here, Burmese.
[45:26.000 --> 45:28.000]  Here's something else, man.
[45:28.000 --> 45:29.000]  Did you hear that?
[45:29.000 --> 45:30.000]  Yeah.
[45:30.000 --> 45:32.000]  That is a great new video.
[45:32.000 --> 45:33.000]  Hey, Burmese, come in here.
[45:33.000 --> 45:34.000]  What's the name of that?
[45:34.000 --> 45:36.000]  I got Tommy Chung coming on.
[45:36.000 --> 45:42.000]  I have to move the Genesis employee under attack to a later date.
[45:42.000 --> 45:44.000]  That new handlebars of video.
[45:44.000 --> 45:46.000]  That's what I was just setting up for you right there, Alex.
[45:46.000 --> 45:49.000]  So you can play it in the fourth hour and people can get video off the DVD player.
[45:49.000 --> 45:51.000]  So it's ready to go.
[45:51.000 --> 45:52.000]  No good D goes unpunished.
[45:52.000 --> 45:54.000]  I'm griping at you for help.
[45:54.000 --> 45:57.000]  Yeah, it's handlebars by the Flowbots and the lead track.
[45:57.000 --> 45:58.000]  I believe it's the...
[45:58.000 --> 45:59.000]  There's a war on for your mind.
[45:59.000 --> 46:00.000]  There's a war going on for your mind.
[46:00.000 --> 46:01.000]  No doubt they're listeners.
[46:01.000 --> 46:02.000]  I want them on.
[46:02.000 --> 46:03.000]  It's a good...
[46:03.000 --> 46:05.000]  By the way, go tell Eddie Bear about that.
[46:05.000 --> 46:07.000]  Because all of the enemy programs are going to scramble again before we do.
[46:07.000 --> 46:08.000]  We have to defeat them.
[46:08.000 --> 46:09.000]  All right.
[46:09.000 --> 46:10.000]  I will let him know.
[46:10.000 --> 46:11.000]  Hey, good job.
[46:11.000 --> 46:12.000]  That's a joke, folks.
[46:12.000 --> 46:13.000]  We are competitive here, but only in a fun way.
[46:13.000 --> 46:15.000]  Okay, I'm going to shut up.
[46:15.000 --> 46:16.000]  I'm sorry.
[46:16.000 --> 46:20.000]  I just wanted to describe what we were hearing just now with Burmese in there.
[46:20.000 --> 46:21.000]  Let me just...
[46:21.000 --> 46:22.000]  I've got the computer turned down.
[46:22.000 --> 46:23.000]  I don't know why that was playing.
[46:23.000 --> 46:24.000]  You know what?
[46:24.000 --> 46:25.000]  Just say whatever you want, Eric.
[46:25.000 --> 46:27.000]  I'm going to shut up for a minute.
[46:27.000 --> 46:30.000]  The only thing I can think of is I've put a new picture up.
[46:30.000 --> 46:32.000]  The revolution will be televised.
[46:32.000 --> 46:38.000]  And I only say that because I know the Alex Jones supporters will get up and show our
[46:38.000 --> 46:40.000]  forces on the 31st of May.
[46:40.000 --> 46:44.500]  But I also want to make sure that the people out there who are supporting Ron Paul, people
[46:44.500 --> 46:49.520]  out there who are supporting the Constitution Party, Libertarian Party, if we want to manifesto
[46:49.520 --> 46:54.760]  to actually come to fruition, if we want to affect the general election and boost up our
[46:54.760 --> 47:00.000]  numbers during the general election, the best way to do it is to...
[47:00.000 --> 47:02.000]  Only put it this way.
[47:02.000 --> 47:04.000]  Sometimes you can't bring a horse to water.
[47:04.000 --> 47:07.000]  Sometimes you've got to put the trough in front of them.
[47:07.000 --> 47:10.840]  And most of the bulk of the people out there to include people in my family, et cetera,
[47:10.840 --> 47:13.760]  they don't go on the internet, they watch television.
[47:13.760 --> 47:18.040]  You know, if we can get something going with a dish network or something or other and actually
[47:18.040 --> 47:22.840]  put this information in front of their faces to where they have no option but just to kind
[47:22.840 --> 47:26.920]  of stare at the boob tube, which is what they're used to anyway, we can bring the water to
[47:26.920 --> 47:31.200]  the horse and we can, you know, bring the information to them, which will get them thinking.
[47:31.200 --> 47:33.200]  So the revolution will be televised.
[47:33.200 --> 47:37.080]  The Ron Paul folks out there, I know a lot of them think that the money bomb kind of
[47:37.080 --> 47:41.000]  belongs to the Ron Paul thing, but you got to think of it this way.
[47:41.000 --> 47:46.280]  Alex Jones, the Info Wars, I mean, you've got David Icke, you've got Republic Magazine,
[47:46.280 --> 47:49.360]  Restore the Republic, you've got We The People Foundation.
[47:49.360 --> 47:54.720]  These are not different factions that need to be protecting their own houses.
[47:54.720 --> 48:01.040]  These are all part of one large, massive awakening that is happening in this country.
[48:01.040 --> 48:02.040]  And so if you're-
[48:02.040 --> 48:03.040]  Eric, I didn't know that.
[48:03.040 --> 48:04.040]  I mean, I didn't know that.
[48:04.040 --> 48:08.680]  You're saying when Ron Paul sat on this show, you ought to go find that interview from last
[48:08.680 --> 48:12.680]  year where he said half his support had come from this show and half the people that came
[48:12.680 --> 48:14.160]  up to him were from this show.
[48:14.160 --> 48:19.560]  I mean, obviously our listeners, even if he, you know, for political reasons doesn't go
[48:19.560 --> 48:23.040]  along with 9-11 Truth, that energizes his core.
[48:23.040 --> 48:28.720]  I mean, there's always going to be some ninnies that are like, no, only Ron Paul, don't get
[48:28.720 --> 48:29.720]  to Alex.
[48:29.720 --> 48:31.200]  I mean, look, it isn't about that.
[48:31.200 --> 48:36.640]  I'm one of the few people who will actually spend 100% of this, and my word is gold.
[48:36.640 --> 48:41.080]  I'm going to spend 100% of the money putting it into infrastructure.
[48:41.080 --> 48:45.880]  And we're going to do the TV show regardless, but I'll immediately do a daily TV show with
[48:45.880 --> 48:50.400]  video with a new set that'll be on YouTube, be on Google, that already all get hundreds
[48:50.400 --> 48:52.000]  of thousands of views per video.
[48:52.000 --> 48:55.160]  So we're going to immediately, immediately engage the enemy.
[48:55.160 --> 48:56.440]  I look at it this way.
[48:56.440 --> 49:02.160]  If we had a network of this kind, you know, broadcasting on televisions across the nation,
[49:02.160 --> 49:08.400]  in fact, across the world, at the beginning of 2007, I can bet with full assurity that
[49:08.400 --> 49:14.200]  the outcome of this current election would have turned out vastly different than it has.
[49:14.200 --> 49:20.600]  Can you imagine if I would have had like a democracy now, but a patriot, you know, constitutionalist,
[49:20.600 --> 49:27.840]  libertarian TV channel, even done bare bones like democracy now did at first, very inexpensive,
[49:27.840 --> 49:32.120]  you know, compared to big networks, it would have energized and blown sky high.
[49:32.120 --> 49:37.840]  I'm looking forward to the day when I see the likes of McCain and Obama and et cetera
[49:37.840 --> 49:43.760]  during a general election on the Alex Jones network television show, as far as a presidential
[49:43.760 --> 49:49.000]  election, what do you call it, debate, where Alex Jones is hosting the debate and asks
[49:49.000 --> 49:50.000]  the questions.
[49:50.000 --> 49:55.040]  Can you imagine Alex Jones asking Senator McCain certain questions?
[49:55.040 --> 49:58.320]  Oh my God, it would be such a party favor.
[49:58.320 --> 50:00.840]  Just to even watch it, the entertainment value alone.
[50:00.840 --> 50:01.840]  Well, you're right, Eric.
[50:01.840 --> 50:02.840]  You're right, Eric.
[50:02.840 --> 50:06.600]  We have to shoot for the stars, and I commend what you're doing.
[50:06.600 --> 50:10.920]  We're going to have 1-800 people, one or two people here at my office, we'll have a 1-800
[50:10.920 --> 50:11.920]  number up in the next few days.
[50:11.920 --> 50:16.800]  The PayPal will be up today, so people are wanting to see it, wanting to go back to my
[50:16.800 --> 50:22.080]  site somehow, but don't give until that Saturday that is coming up.
[50:22.080 --> 50:25.520]  And ladies and gentlemen, we'll be posting and announcing the numbers every few hours.
[50:25.520 --> 50:33.640]  I'll be giving them to Eric Nordstrom as that develops, infowarsmoneybomb.com, infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[50:33.640 --> 50:40.160]  We're going to talk to one of the Genesis employees who's being harassed by the police
[50:40.160 --> 50:43.320]  and her daughter being harassed on the other side of this quick break.
[50:43.320 --> 50:46.680]  Eric, let me get you to pop back in with another update tomorrow, okay?
[50:46.680 --> 50:47.680]  Yes, sir.
[50:47.680 --> 50:48.680]  Thank you so much, infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[50:48.680 --> 50:54.520]  Yeah, I mean, we supported Ron Paul, I mean, will you support us?
[50:54.520 --> 50:56.480]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[50:56.480 --> 51:00.960]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide, but in Liberty's darkest
[51:00.960 --> 51:02.520]  hour there is hope.
[51:02.520 --> 51:05.400]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[51:05.400 --> 51:09.800]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New
[51:09.800 --> 51:11.320]  World Order master plan.
[51:11.320 --> 51:15.560]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[51:15.560 --> 51:20.920]  In the Info War, prisonplanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[51:20.920 --> 51:23.800]  Prisonplanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.
[51:23.800 --> 51:28.360]  All 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded or streamed in super high quality directly
[51:28.360 --> 51:31.360]  to your computer or iPhone and shared with others.
[51:31.360 --> 51:35.560]  Thousands of special video reports from tainted vaccines to martial law can be found in this
[51:35.560 --> 51:37.000]  online video library.
[51:37.000 --> 51:41.800]  By weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews and so much more.
[51:41.800 --> 51:44.640]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.
[51:44.640 --> 51:50.880]  Join prisonplanet.tv, burn the Info bombs to disk, put them on the file sharing networks,
[51:50.880 --> 52:20.080]  bring down the New World Order, prisonplanet.tv.
[52:20.080 --> 52:23.640]  For example, a sliced carrot looks like the human eye.
[52:23.640 --> 52:28.400]  The pupil iris and radiating lines look just like the human eye and science now shows that
[52:28.400 --> 52:32.360]  carrots greatly enhance blood flow to and function of the eyes.
[52:32.360 --> 52:35.040]  A tomato has four chambers and is red.
[52:35.040 --> 52:37.640]  The heart is red and has four chambers.
[52:37.640 --> 52:41.800]  Research now shows tomatoes are indeed pure blood and heart food.
[52:41.800 --> 52:45.360]  A walnut looks like a little brain, a left and right hemisphere.
[52:45.360 --> 52:52.280]  We now know that walnuts help develop over three dozen neuron transmitters for brain function.
[52:52.280 --> 52:57.080]  Kidney beans actually heal and help maintain kidney function and they look just like human
[52:57.080 --> 52:58.080]  kidneys.
[52:58.080 --> 53:00.720]  Salary and rhubarb look like bones.
[53:00.720 --> 53:03.680]  These foods specifically target bone strength.
[53:03.680 --> 53:06.080]  Bones are 23% sodium.
[53:06.080 --> 53:09.080]  These foods are 23% sodium.
[53:09.080 --> 53:14.920]  Sweet potatoes look like the pancreas and actually balance the glycemic index of diabetics.
[53:14.920 --> 53:19.880]  There's more on the food list, but there is a miracle food that most have never heard
[53:19.880 --> 53:20.880]  of.
[53:20.880 --> 53:26.920]  A soul food and drink, you might say, that will miraculously help every part of the body.
[53:26.920 --> 53:51.720]  No one is being told about it, but we tell about these foods and about it at www.anotheruntoldstory.com.
[54:21.880 --> 54:26.440]  falls off the picnic table, police are watching month in jail.
[54:26.440 --> 54:30.640]  These are articles I have in front of me.
[54:30.640 --> 54:32.440]  Don't use your turn signal, arrest it.
[54:32.440 --> 54:35.960]  Don't have a seatbelt on even if you get out of your mailbox and drive 50 yards of
[54:35.960 --> 54:37.240]  your house, arrest it.
[54:37.240 --> 54:39.800]  That's right here outside Austin.
[54:39.800 --> 54:41.360]  Just maximum enforcement.
[54:41.360 --> 54:45.160]  There's not even laws that three absences you go to jail, but they still arrest you
[54:45.160 --> 54:46.160]  in Austin.
[54:46.160 --> 54:50.160]  I have all the video of that and county commissioners admitting it with the ASAP program.
[54:50.160 --> 54:51.240]  Look, they're building presents.
[54:51.240 --> 54:52.240]  They need people.
[54:52.240 --> 54:53.240]  The schools are training camps.
[54:53.240 --> 54:57.360]  I know with the economy, it's hard to not have your child in a government death camp.
[54:57.360 --> 55:03.480]  Prozac, Ritalin, sex, drugs, use program where they teach them how to feel inadequate and
[55:03.480 --> 55:06.120]  teach them how to be Madison Avenue slaves.
[55:06.120 --> 55:10.480]  I went to a government training camp for school and even most of the private schools
[55:10.480 --> 55:13.360]  are now under government training camp regulation and control.
[55:13.360 --> 55:15.400]  I'm not joking about that.
[55:15.400 --> 55:24.000]  Now, Kristen Davies, well, I talked to her a few times, she's real nice, the webmaster
[55:24.000 --> 55:28.240]  for GCNLive.com, but I'm told she's a really professional, nice person.
[55:28.240 --> 55:30.440]  Her mom sometimes picks up her daughter.
[55:30.440 --> 55:32.240]  She didn't pick her up yesterday.
[55:32.240 --> 55:33.240]  Doesn't matter.
[55:33.240 --> 55:34.880]  The police call her and say, we know your mother ran into cars.
[55:34.880 --> 55:36.320]  He said, well, you got video?
[55:36.320 --> 55:37.320]  No.
[55:37.320 --> 55:38.320]  Well, we know she picked them up here.
[55:38.320 --> 55:39.320]  She's like, she didn't pick them up.
[55:39.320 --> 55:40.600]  I'm going to pick my daughter up.
[55:40.600 --> 55:42.800]  So they said, well, we're going to question your daughter tomorrow at school.
[55:42.800 --> 55:45.360]  And she said, you can't do that without a lawyer without my consent.
[55:45.360 --> 55:46.360]  Without due process.
[55:46.360 --> 55:47.800]  They said, yeah, we will.
[55:47.800 --> 55:51.000]  She still put her daughter in school today.
[55:51.000 --> 55:55.720]  I'm not saying she's bad, but you know, the point is, is that we don't know what's going
[55:55.720 --> 55:56.720]  on.
[55:56.720 --> 55:59.720]  It's a violation of the fourth, fifth, and seventh amendment, but they still do it all
[55:59.720 --> 56:00.720]  the time.
[56:00.720 --> 56:03.240]  And she told her daughter not to talk to him.
[56:03.240 --> 56:06.000]  But the point is she didn't quote Boppa teacher's car.
[56:06.000 --> 56:12.080]  This is just, just these, these, these, these, I mean, this is what these facilities are.
[56:12.080 --> 56:14.600]  Miss Davies or Mrs. Davies, tell me what's going on.
[56:14.600 --> 56:22.520]  Well, I just got a phone call yesterday from a police officer and he didn't tell me anything.
[56:22.520 --> 56:23.520]  He didn't really say anything.
[56:23.520 --> 56:27.760]  All he just started out with was, will you tell me what happened today?
[56:27.760 --> 56:32.320]  And he said it very cruel and mean and harsh like I had done something wrong.
[56:32.320 --> 56:35.880]  And I told him I had didn't know what he was talking about.
[56:35.880 --> 56:41.240]  And then he said that something had happened in my daughter's school and he still wasn't
[56:41.240 --> 56:42.400]  telling me what was going on.
[56:42.400 --> 56:45.320]  Well, see, that's a violation of your due process.
[56:45.320 --> 56:47.440]  They never let you know it's an investigation.
[56:47.440 --> 56:51.520]  It's a trick and, and, and, and so you didn't even know what he was talking about.
[56:51.520 --> 56:53.040]  You mean when he called, you had no idea.
[56:53.040 --> 56:57.160]  No, no, because nothing, imagine how easy it is parents don't know these are hunting
[56:57.160 --> 57:00.040]  grounds and they can just feed at leisure.
[57:00.040 --> 57:01.040]  They've got quotas.
[57:01.040 --> 57:02.520]  Whoever's in there might want to close the door.
[57:02.520 --> 57:07.640]  I'm getting a radio feedback.
[57:07.640 --> 57:11.120]  Kristen can, Kristen, continue for me.
[57:11.120 --> 57:15.960]  Well, when he finally told me there was a hit and run accident, he said that my mom
[57:15.960 --> 57:19.880]  had picked my daughter up from school and I witnessed told him that when she picked
[57:19.880 --> 57:26.320]  her up, she maliciously rammed into two teachers vehicles and then tore off.
[57:26.320 --> 57:29.760]  And my mother was nowhere near the school yesterday and my mother did not pick up my
[57:29.760 --> 57:31.520]  children from school yesterday.
[57:31.520 --> 57:35.520]  It doesn't matter if you were to go talk to them, they might taser you, beat you, claim
[57:35.520 --> 57:36.520]  you attacked them.
[57:36.520 --> 57:37.680]  They're just looking for somebody.
[57:37.680 --> 57:38.680]  Yeah.
[57:38.680 --> 57:40.680]  I'm not joking, by the way, folks.
[57:40.680 --> 57:42.600]  You never know when you're dealing with a criminal department.
[57:42.600 --> 57:44.440]  What department is this?
[57:44.440 --> 57:45.440]  I don't know.
[57:45.440 --> 57:46.440]  I really don't know.
[57:46.440 --> 57:47.440]  You need to follow me.
[57:47.440 --> 57:48.440]  Where's your daughter?
[57:48.440 --> 57:49.440]  What area of the city?
[57:49.440 --> 57:50.440]  I mean, Minneapolis, St. Paul.
[57:50.440 --> 57:52.440]  Oh, Minneapolis Suburb, St. Louis Park.
[57:52.440 --> 57:54.440]  Oh, St. Louis Park Police?
[57:54.440 --> 57:55.440]  Yeah.
[57:55.440 --> 57:58.040]  Is this school, Gestapo?
[57:58.040 --> 58:01.600]  When I talked to the school, the principal actually was on my side and said that they
[58:01.600 --> 58:04.960]  weren't going to be talking to my daughter without informing her so that she could inform
[58:04.960 --> 58:05.960]  me first.
[58:05.960 --> 58:10.200]  Well, they'll usually black off and tell you that, but it might be a nice principal.
[58:10.200 --> 58:11.640]  That's all part of deception and wickedness.
[58:11.640 --> 58:14.600]  I mean, they lie and say your daughter's got to take shots when there's no law.
[58:14.600 --> 58:16.680]  Have they lied and told you that?
[58:16.680 --> 58:17.680]  No.
[58:17.680 --> 58:18.680]  Okay, that's good.

[58:22.680 --> 58:23.920]  I want to hold you over, Kristen.
[58:23.920 --> 58:24.920]  This is important.
[58:24.920 --> 58:27.600]  And I'm not joking, by the way.
[58:27.600 --> 58:28.760]  Don't get in their clutches.
[58:28.760 --> 58:35.840]  It's all about feeding on the slaves, we'll be right back.

[59:46.880 --> 59:57.480]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[59:57.480 --> 1:00:11.880]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:11.880 --> 1:00:21.080]  We're talking to GCN employee, Kristen Davies, really classy, nice young lady.
[1:00:21.080 --> 1:00:31.280]  Her daughter goes to government training camp, and who did pick your daughter up yesterday?
[1:00:31.280 --> 1:00:36.560]  They're calling you up saying your mother, who picked her up as a psychopathic, mad dog,
[1:00:36.560 --> 1:00:39.520]  Christine driver, but like you said, your mother didn't pick her up.
[1:00:39.520 --> 1:00:42.560]  How did your daughter get out of the government training camp?
[1:00:42.560 --> 1:00:44.320]  She was picked up by a friend yesterday.
[1:00:44.320 --> 1:00:47.640]  Okay, so she was picked up by a friend?
[1:00:47.640 --> 1:00:48.640]  Yeah.
[1:00:48.640 --> 1:00:50.480]  Was the friend driving or was it a friend's parents?
[1:00:50.480 --> 1:00:53.480]  No, it was a friend of mine, I'm sorry.
[1:00:53.480 --> 1:00:57.440]  Okay, but it doesn't matter, they're just saying your mother did it.
[1:00:57.440 --> 1:00:58.440]  Yeah.
[1:00:58.440 --> 1:01:00.680]  And the cop told you, I'm going to question your daughter?
[1:01:00.680 --> 1:01:06.720]  Yeah, he said that we're going to be interviewing your daughter to get her side of things.
[1:01:06.720 --> 1:01:12.320]  And I said that I didn't want anybody talking to my daughter without me being present, and
[1:01:12.320 --> 1:01:15.200]  he yelled at me, told me to shut up, not to tell him how to do his job.
[1:01:15.200 --> 1:01:17.320]  I mean, they kept treating me like I was a criminal.
[1:01:17.320 --> 1:01:21.240]  Everybody's got to buy recorders and hook them up to their phones, everybody needs to
[1:01:21.240 --> 1:01:24.960]  buy a cheap video camera or at least a digital recorder.
[1:01:24.960 --> 1:01:26.280]  So he told you to shut up.
[1:01:26.280 --> 1:01:28.680]  Yeah, he told me to shut up, not tell him how to do his job.
[1:01:28.680 --> 1:01:29.680]  What's his name?
[1:01:29.680 --> 1:01:33.400]  I want his name.
[1:01:33.400 --> 1:01:37.680]  I talked to so many people yesterday, I haven't written down on a piece of paper at home.
[1:01:37.680 --> 1:01:40.280]  Well, I want you to get that for us tomorrow.
[1:01:40.280 --> 1:01:42.360]  I want you to file a complaint on him.
[1:01:42.360 --> 1:01:45.120]  Yeah, I called and talked to his superior yesterday too.
[1:01:45.120 --> 1:01:47.960]  He'll probably get promoted for that, so you just need to go ahead and write it up on the
[1:01:47.960 --> 1:01:52.800]  web, post it on the Genesis site, so the rest of his life, people Google his name, they'll
[1:01:52.800 --> 1:01:53.800]  know who he is.
[1:01:53.800 --> 1:01:54.800]  So he told you to shut up.
[1:01:54.800 --> 1:01:57.240]  How were you talking to this demigod when he told you to shut up?
[1:01:57.240 --> 1:02:01.640]  I was actually being really nice and I was trying to maintain control and I told him
[1:02:01.640 --> 1:02:05.080]  the reason I didn't want to talk to him or didn't want my daughter to talk to him without
[1:02:05.080 --> 1:02:06.080]  my being there.
[1:02:06.080 --> 1:02:08.960]  As I said that, you know, she's a very sensitive child and I was worried that this was going
[1:02:08.960 --> 1:02:11.080]  to scare her.
[1:02:11.080 --> 1:02:12.080]  And he said shut up.
[1:02:12.080 --> 1:02:13.080]  Yeah, he said shut up.
[1:02:13.080 --> 1:02:14.760]  I don't tell me how to do my job.
[1:02:14.760 --> 1:02:18.840]  I can talk to your daughter if I want to, and we talk to children all the time without
[1:02:18.840 --> 1:02:20.160]  their parents being present.
[1:02:20.160 --> 1:02:21.160]  Shut up!
[1:02:21.160 --> 1:02:23.440]  Shut up and pay my paycheck slave!
[1:02:23.440 --> 1:02:27.200]  Man, I'm tired of these people.
[1:02:27.200 --> 1:02:29.680]  So what else did this piece of filth say?
[1:02:29.680 --> 1:02:34.720]  He just kept treating me like I had done something wrong and he kept saying that, you know, I
[1:02:34.720 --> 1:02:39.280]  needed to give up information and I said I don't know what information he could give
[1:02:39.280 --> 1:02:40.280]  you.
[1:02:40.280 --> 1:02:41.280]  So he was bullying you without counsel?
[1:02:41.280 --> 1:02:42.280]  Yeah.
[1:02:42.280 --> 1:02:44.880]  And then I talked to his superior and told him what happened.
[1:02:44.880 --> 1:02:49.280]  His superior was saying that, well, we use tactics to get criminals to be forthcoming
[1:02:49.280 --> 1:02:52.000]  because they don't normally, you know, spill their guts.
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:53.400]  So we have to use special tactics.
[1:02:53.400 --> 1:02:57.800]  Oh yeah, they can't stop the Los Zetas CIA train, hit teams, murdering cops everywhere.
[1:02:57.800 --> 1:02:59.680]  They can always slap around some woman.
[1:02:59.680 --> 1:03:00.680]  Yeah.
[1:03:00.680 --> 1:03:02.080]  It's an absolute filth.
[1:03:02.080 --> 1:03:03.080]  Yeah.
[1:03:03.080 --> 1:03:04.080]  Oh, I can't handle it anymore.
[1:03:04.080 --> 1:03:05.080]  Yeah.
[1:03:05.080 --> 1:03:06.080]  So now you got me scared.
[1:03:06.080 --> 1:03:07.080]  I want to go get my daughter out of school.
[1:03:07.080 --> 1:03:09.880]  Yeah, I tell you what, go ahead, yeah, don't make a scene or they'll try to swatch you
[1:03:09.880 --> 1:03:10.880]  right there.
[1:03:10.880 --> 1:03:11.880]  Yeah.
[1:03:11.880 --> 1:03:13.320]  And then you have to just say, oh, family issue.
[1:03:13.320 --> 1:03:14.320]  Thank you.
[1:03:14.320 --> 1:03:15.320]  Yeah.
[1:03:15.320 --> 1:03:16.320]  And just get her out.
[1:03:16.320 --> 1:03:17.320]  Because I was thinking you're schooled in this week or next.
[1:03:17.320 --> 1:03:18.320]  You're telling me the government camps.
[1:03:18.320 --> 1:03:19.640]  I know they're phasing it in.
[1:03:19.640 --> 1:03:22.880]  She won't be out of school for a month up in Socialist Minnesota.
[1:03:22.880 --> 1:03:23.880]  Yeah.
[1:03:23.880 --> 1:03:24.880]  Yeah.
[1:03:24.880 --> 1:03:26.880]  We go to the middle of June.
[1:03:26.880 --> 1:03:31.520]  Well, I know you work hard, Kristen, we ought to hit Ted up for a race and put her
[1:03:31.520 --> 1:03:33.200]  in a private school.
[1:03:33.200 --> 1:03:35.400]  At least they're not like total prison facilities.
[1:03:35.400 --> 1:03:40.280]  But I just feel sorry for so many Americans who can't quote the free schooling and actually
[1:03:40.280 --> 1:03:44.280]  is our property tax, unbelievable amounts of money.
[1:03:44.280 --> 1:03:48.280]  And it's just, it's just, it's so far gone.
[1:03:48.280 --> 1:03:52.320]  And again, folks, my whole life, I've had cops threaten to frame me, cops dealing drugs
[1:03:52.320 --> 1:03:56.040]  around me, total corruption, total evil.
[1:03:56.040 --> 1:03:59.360]  And then that's why, I mean, I'm not going to play the game of saying they're a bunch
[1:03:59.360 --> 1:04:01.440]  of little angel cakes.
[1:04:01.440 --> 1:04:03.680]  And Kristen, I'm sorry, I treated you like filth.
[1:04:03.680 --> 1:04:05.880]  We don't respect him either.
[1:04:05.880 --> 1:04:07.160]  And I want his name tomorrow.
[1:04:07.160 --> 1:04:08.160]  Okay.
[1:04:08.160 --> 1:04:09.160]  Okay.
[1:04:09.160 --> 1:04:13.680]  I'm going to go to the department and get your daughter out of there because how old's
[1:04:13.680 --> 1:04:15.680]  your daughter?
[1:04:15.680 --> 1:04:16.680]  12.
[1:04:16.680 --> 1:04:17.680]  She's 12.
[1:04:17.680 --> 1:04:18.680]  Oh man.
[1:04:18.680 --> 1:04:19.680]  Yeah.
[1:04:19.680 --> 1:04:23.240]  When I was in high school, they were doing drug searches and I shot my mouth off and said,
[1:04:23.240 --> 1:04:26.960]  these cops are drug dealers because I happened to have friends that I'd seen cops deliver
[1:04:26.960 --> 1:04:34.120]  drugs to and, and I was even in the drug scene, by the way, I was just around it was everywhere.
[1:04:34.120 --> 1:04:38.440]  And they took me in, slammed my head on the desk and said, I will kill you if you talk
[1:04:38.440 --> 1:04:39.440]  about this.
[1:04:39.440 --> 1:04:40.440]  So that was kind of my wake up.
[1:04:40.440 --> 1:04:41.440]  Okay.
[1:04:41.440 --> 1:04:44.000]  Well, thank you so much, Christine.
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  Thank you.
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  Thank you.
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  There goes the evil criminal.

[1:09:01.120 --> 1:09:06.680]  smoke marijuana and pipes are legal but the government selectively went in and arrested
[1:09:06.680 --> 1:09:10.560]  them, sent him to prison, he went their all manner of things, they tried to set him up
[1:09:10.560 --> 1:09:11.560]  there.
[1:09:11.560 --> 1:09:13.960]  I wanted to tell that whole story today as much as he can.
[1:09:13.960 --> 1:09:19.080]  Now they made a film called Tommy Chong or AKA Tommy Chong and they were going to play
[1:09:19.080 --> 1:09:20.080]  part of a newscast.
[1:09:20.080 --> 1:09:25.120]  They raided the business, stole 10,000 of the DVDs, took everything and they're trying
[1:09:25.120 --> 1:09:26.120]  to punish him.
[1:09:26.120 --> 1:09:31.160]  Now, they also raided Celica Stillo, the high level DEA agent, highly decorated by Ronald
[1:09:31.160 --> 1:09:35.720]  Reagan and George Bush Sr. who found out about government drug dealing, Oliver North, Alapango
[1:09:35.720 --> 1:09:43.000]  Airport, Nicaragua, they raided him and said you better shut up, I saw you on TV, you're
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:45.040]  going to pay for that TV show.
[1:09:45.040 --> 1:09:49.080]  So they're really upset about American Drug War because it's aired 50 plus times now
[1:09:49.080 --> 1:09:54.680]  on Showtime the last three months, it's really hot and there's a big buzz out for it and
[1:09:54.680 --> 1:09:59.920]  it really destroys the whole fraud and so we are honored to have Tommy Chong with us
[1:09:59.920 --> 1:10:04.600]  five minutes into the next hour and we're also going to have Kevin Booth joining us
[1:10:04.600 --> 1:10:08.560]  in about 20 minutes on air than the maker of American Drug War.
[1:10:08.560 --> 1:10:10.680]  Mr. Chong, thank you for coming on with us.
[1:10:10.680 --> 1:10:11.680]  My pleasure, man.
[1:10:11.680 --> 1:10:14.080]  It's always fun to be on the Alex Jones show.
[1:10:14.080 --> 1:10:15.480]  Well, thank you.
[1:10:15.480 --> 1:10:16.680]  Where should we start?
[1:10:16.680 --> 1:10:21.400]  Should we go to the latest stuff that's happened, start at the end or start at the beginning?
[1:10:21.400 --> 1:10:31.560]  Well, the beginning of it all, let's start at the beginning because what happened to
[1:10:31.560 --> 1:10:40.040]  me really was a micro look at what happened to America because I was taken by surprise
[1:10:40.040 --> 1:10:52.320]  as was everybody, I was just doing my comedy and selling my water pipes and next thing
[1:10:52.320 --> 1:11:01.440]  I know I'm in jail for nine months for some little obscure booby trap law that they put
[1:11:01.440 --> 1:11:07.160]  in there that made it illegal to send drug paraphernalia across the state line using the
[1:11:07.160 --> 1:11:14.880]  government mail and that was the technicality that they really busted me on and then they
[1:11:14.880 --> 1:11:21.480]  threatened my wife and my son with incarceration if I were to fight it.
[1:11:21.480 --> 1:11:28.800]  They didn't want this to go to court because I would have been able to show the jury of
[1:11:28.800 --> 1:11:34.360]  my peers how evil and how ridiculous these people are.
[1:11:34.360 --> 1:11:38.960]  And by the way, 100 years ago, 200 years ago, 50 years ago, you didn't threaten people's
[1:11:38.960 --> 1:11:39.960]  family.
[1:11:39.960 --> 1:11:40.960]  That is a terroristic threat.
[1:11:40.960 --> 1:11:41.960]  That is terrorism.
[1:11:41.960 --> 1:11:43.460]  Don't fight this.
[1:11:43.460 --> 1:11:46.360]  Give up your rights or we're going to get your wife and your children.
[1:11:46.360 --> 1:11:56.480]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, and then the way they even got us to break the law was total entrapment.
[1:11:56.480 --> 1:12:04.640]  They just went out and, you know, fake like they had a head shop and then when we wouldn't
[1:12:04.640 --> 1:12:10.920]  send them, when we wouldn't break the law, they put people in my company or in my son's
[1:12:10.920 --> 1:12:15.120]  company and they broke the law basically.
[1:12:15.120 --> 1:12:16.120]  Let's walk through that.
[1:12:16.120 --> 1:12:18.400]  This is a double sting.
[1:12:18.400 --> 1:12:23.040]  This has been big in the Seattle papers where the cops now own in more than half the bars
[1:12:23.040 --> 1:12:27.560]  and restaurants because they seize them and then illegally own the original things they
[1:12:27.560 --> 1:12:29.120]  seized.
[1:12:29.120 --> 1:12:34.520]  And what has happened there is a cop will sell a cop drugs in your bathroom and then
[1:12:34.520 --> 1:12:38.520]  seize your business in Seattle, one of the most corrupt cities for that in the country,
[1:12:38.520 --> 1:12:40.840]  totally lawless by the system.
[1:12:40.840 --> 1:12:42.360]  And that's the same thing.
[1:12:42.360 --> 1:12:47.040]  They set up a business, put somebody in your business to mail and commit the crime.
[1:12:47.040 --> 1:12:48.040]  They should all go to prison.
[1:12:48.040 --> 1:12:49.040]  Go ahead.
[1:12:49.040 --> 1:12:53.040]  Yeah, well, that's what they did, you know, and in mind, because we even documented it's
[1:12:53.040 --> 1:12:58.320]  in the documentary, AKA Tommy Chong, where, you know, we have the film that the undercover
[1:12:58.320 --> 1:13:05.280]  people used, you know, where, you know, where they're filming or they're recording us saying
[1:13:05.280 --> 1:13:10.280]  no to their request to send them a, you know, bongs across the state line.
[1:13:10.280 --> 1:13:18.680]  And then we see them come into head shops and, you know, undercover and so they really
[1:13:18.680 --> 1:13:23.760]  had, you know, it was a total set up and they told me that they were under the gun.
[1:13:23.760 --> 1:13:29.760]  They had to do it that way because I wasn't breaking any law and so they had the raid
[1:13:29.760 --> 1:13:36.800]  all set up to go, you know, coordinated to do a, you know, worldwide raid on all the
[1:13:36.800 --> 1:13:45.680]  bong shops and because they wanted me, I was their trophy, they had to do what they did.
[1:13:45.680 --> 1:13:52.240]  They even told me that, you know, they told me, you know, that I forced them to do what
[1:13:52.240 --> 1:13:56.840]  they did because I wouldn't break the law, you know, and the thing was I never broke
[1:13:56.840 --> 1:13:57.840]  the law.
[1:13:57.840 --> 1:14:02.040]  Anyway, you know, it wasn't my company, it was my son's company that did it.
[1:14:02.040 --> 1:14:07.360]  And so, you know, when they threatened me and, you know, when I seen how desperate these
[1:14:07.360 --> 1:14:12.800]  guys were, I realized, you know, I never had a chance, you know, and what I did, what
[1:14:12.800 --> 1:14:17.640]  I wanted to do anyway is I wanted to take a look, you know, I really didn't want to
[1:14:17.640 --> 1:14:24.960]  go to jail, of course no one does, but once I, you know, accepted the fact that it was
[1:14:24.960 --> 1:14:29.560]  going to happen, then I turned around and then I became like a reporter, you know, where
[1:14:29.560 --> 1:14:35.600]  I kept my eyes and, you know, years open and my mouth shut and I just documented what
[1:14:35.600 --> 1:14:36.600]  went on.
[1:14:36.600 --> 1:14:39.240]  Yeah, that's what exceptional people always do.
[1:14:39.240 --> 1:14:43.480]  You didn't want to go through that persecution and hardship, but you turned it into something
[1:14:43.480 --> 1:14:47.360]  good and that's a real mark of an amazing person, Mr. Chong.
[1:14:47.360 --> 1:14:53.680]  Yeah, well, you know, it was that, the thing is, you know, when you go to jail and you
[1:14:53.680 --> 1:14:58.880]  never, you know, and you're not a criminal, you know, most criminals, you know, when they
[1:14:58.880 --> 1:15:03.880]  get caught, it's almost a relief for them, you know, and I met a lot of people in jail
[1:15:03.880 --> 1:15:10.480]  that they almost get caught on purpose so they can, you know, you get rid of that drama
[1:15:10.480 --> 1:15:13.640]  in their life and go on with it with, you know, the incarceration part.
[1:15:13.640 --> 1:15:18.680]  And a lot of them lived in foster care or in the government system, they want to be back
[1:15:18.680 --> 1:15:19.680]  in there, yeah.
[1:15:19.680 --> 1:15:20.680]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1:15:20.680 --> 1:15:25.440]  I mean, it's very comforting to them, you know, because once you're in jail, you know,
[1:15:25.440 --> 1:15:31.200]  you don't have to think for yourself, you know, you're like a caged chicken, you know,
[1:15:31.200 --> 1:15:37.200]  they just take you out, feed you, and exercise you, and then put you back in your cage.
[1:15:37.200 --> 1:15:42.120]  And there's a lot of people, you know, in the system that really like that, you know,
[1:15:42.120 --> 1:15:48.360]  as opposed to them living on the streets or, you know, in some dead-end job, you know,
[1:15:48.360 --> 1:15:49.840]  where they really have to work.
[1:15:49.840 --> 1:15:54.640]  In prison, you don't work, you know, basically, you work a few hours a day, maybe, you know,
[1:15:54.640 --> 1:15:57.120]  but it's not difficult at all.
[1:15:57.120 --> 1:16:05.360]  And what you do mostly in jail is read, that's what I did, I read, and you eat.
[1:16:05.360 --> 1:16:15.640]  And so what's happening with America is that these greedy corporate, you know, entities
[1:16:15.640 --> 1:16:25.480]  have gotten the population to where it becomes a way of life with them, with these people.
[1:16:25.480 --> 1:16:29.960]  You know, like the prison guard union is the biggest in California.
[1:16:29.960 --> 1:16:33.200]  And that means really the biggest in America.
[1:16:33.200 --> 1:16:39.200]  And this, their job is to incarcerate American citizens, or, you know, anybody.
[1:16:39.200 --> 1:16:44.360]  Well, they just had a frontline special where they had, or it showed in Texas and other
[1:16:44.360 --> 1:16:49.480]  states, the private prison industry comes in lobbies for stronger laws to put people
[1:16:49.480 --> 1:16:50.480]  in jail.
[1:16:50.480 --> 1:16:53.600]  Now, Florida, if you speed, you get 10 years in prison.
[1:16:53.600 --> 1:16:57.920]  Now, if a child had the article in Texas, fell asleep at his desk because his mom had
[1:16:57.920 --> 1:17:02.640]  gone to the hospital the night before he was an A student, they arrested him, charged him,
[1:17:02.640 --> 1:17:07.920]  put handcuffs on him, he's now in probation for falling asleep as disorderly conduct.
[1:17:07.920 --> 1:17:11.440]  And they are just going mad dog crazy on us.
[1:17:11.440 --> 1:17:14.320]  Oh, absolutely, absolutely.
[1:17:14.320 --> 1:17:19.640]  And because there's no checks and balances, you know, like when I was incarcerated, they
[1:17:19.640 --> 1:17:25.040]  used to lock us down around Christmas time.
[1:17:25.040 --> 1:17:28.440]  You know, they would just say, okay, lock down.
[1:17:28.440 --> 1:17:33.480]  And that's what you do when there's a riot or when there's any kind of trouble in the
[1:17:33.480 --> 1:17:38.960]  yard or, you know, they lock everybody down.
[1:17:38.960 --> 1:17:45.120]  And then when they lock everybody down, everybody's in their cell, everybody's locked in.
[1:17:45.120 --> 1:17:50.720]  And then they do the search, you know, the sort of the obligatory search, and they're
[1:17:50.720 --> 1:17:55.680]  always going to find something, you know, because you're not allowed to have anything
[1:17:55.680 --> 1:17:58.320]  in, you know, in your cell or anything like that there.
[1:17:58.320 --> 1:18:03.000]  So, and the reason they do that is so they can collect double overtime.
[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:11.520]  You see, so what they do, they supplement their Christmas income by these phony lockdowns.
[1:18:11.520 --> 1:18:17.440]  And there's all sorts of scams going on in the prison system that people aren't aware
[1:18:17.440 --> 1:18:18.600]  of, you know.
[1:18:18.600 --> 1:18:24.680]  There's a one called diesel therapy where they just take wake prisoners up for no reason.
[1:18:24.680 --> 1:18:30.480]  You know, they're being held, you know, for a trial or being held in between, you know,
[1:18:30.480 --> 1:18:31.480]  prisons.
[1:18:31.480 --> 1:18:37.440]  And then they'll put them on a bus, a prison bus, and they'll ship them across the country
[1:18:37.440 --> 1:18:41.480]  or even put them on a plane and ship them across the country.
[1:18:41.480 --> 1:18:46.840]  And there again, when they do that, they get paid extra money for doing that.
[1:18:46.840 --> 1:18:49.960]  And we pay, we pay the taxes up, sorry, go ahead.
[1:18:49.960 --> 1:18:54.360]  Oh yeah, no, it's all out of the go, it's all out of the taxpayers' money, it's all
[1:18:54.360 --> 1:18:56.480]  on the taxpayers' dollar.
[1:18:56.480 --> 1:19:01.720]  And they just do this, you know, they do it as a form of punishment for, like if they
[1:19:01.720 --> 1:19:04.440]  don't like a prisoner, they'll tag them.
[1:19:04.440 --> 1:19:07.880]  And they'll say, okay, this guy's going to go on diesel therapy.
[1:19:07.880 --> 1:19:13.280]  And they'll wake them up like midnight or two in the morning and then shackle them and
[1:19:13.280 --> 1:19:16.960]  put them in with other prisoners and then they'll take them on a bus and away they go.
[1:19:16.960 --> 1:19:17.960]  And they don't go away.
[1:19:17.960 --> 1:19:21.400]  And that is, that is the form of torture.
[1:19:21.400 --> 1:19:25.880]  Congressman Hanson exposed the IRS, so they drove him around for months till all his feet
[1:19:25.880 --> 1:19:26.880]  exploded.
[1:19:26.880 --> 1:19:31.680]  The toes all popped out, they knocked his teeth out, this is a U.S. congressman.
[1:19:31.680 --> 1:19:33.960]  And it was done with extreme pleasure and enjoyment.
[1:19:33.960 --> 1:19:39.920]  A nation of torturing thugs and killers, the biggest part of the economy growing, growing,
[1:19:39.920 --> 1:19:51.240]  spreading like a staff infection, flesh-eating bacteria, the country dying as they celebrate.

[1:20:01.960 --> 1:20:04.400]  destroys the official fable forever.

[1:20:42.200 --> 1:20:44.960]  We're in a no-holds-far information war.
[1:20:44.960 --> 1:20:49.560]  Truth is our weapon, and prisonplanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back
[1:20:49.560 --> 1:20:50.560]  to Big Brother.
[1:20:50.560 --> 1:20:52.480]  Why should we fire Congress?
[1:20:52.480 --> 1:20:55.880]  Because they use the Constitution of the United States as a scrap of paper.
[1:20:55.880 --> 1:20:58.380]  They swear an oath to follow it, and then they reject it.
[1:20:58.380 --> 1:21:01.000]  That was their employment document.
[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:02.000]  They haven't followed it.
[1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:04.000]  Congressman, Senators, you're fired.
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:05.720]  Washington, you're fired!
[1:21:05.720 --> 1:21:07.840]  I think it's the next freedom to fascism.
[1:21:07.840 --> 1:21:11.280]  Washington, you're fired was born out of sheer frustration with abuses in our current
[1:21:11.280 --> 1:21:14.760]  political system, and it gives a voice to Americans across the country.
[1:21:14.760 --> 1:21:19.240]  Washington, you're fired examines constitutional issues as they relate to the Katrina disaster,
[1:21:19.240 --> 1:21:23.920]  the president's illegal spy program, NSA data mining, FISA secret court, the illegal
[1:21:23.920 --> 1:21:27.800]  wiretapping of millions of Americans, and the last seven years of terror-related spy
[1:21:27.800 --> 1:21:31.160]  bills, how they affect you, and what you can do about it.
[1:21:31.160 --> 1:21:35.200]  Washington, you're fired, captures the spirit and zest of an old-fashioned Boston Tea Party.
[1:21:35.200 --> 1:21:39.080]  Ken Williams describes the film as a rabble-rousing call to arms.
[1:21:39.080 --> 1:21:41.000]  We invite you to make the change with us.
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:42.520]  Help take back our government now.

[1:22:10.120 --> 1:22:14.960]  responsibility for reigning the men and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate
[1:22:14.960 --> 1:22:17.160]  since they reside the world over.

[1:22:21.560 --> 1:22:24.360]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[1:22:24.360 --> 1:22:28.840]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago, everything they have built
[1:22:28.840 --> 1:22:33.520]  over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning
[1:22:33.520 --> 1:22:38.520]  of the masses, the destruction of the earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority

[1:24:30.940 --> 1:24:36.200]  with the raid on the makers of the film, aka Tommy Chong.
[1:24:36.200 --> 1:24:40.340]  The prisons, the whole culture, the police military culture has gone completely criminal
[1:24:40.340 --> 1:24:47.440]  and now hiring felons, illegal aliens, it's a total shift into bedlam and they are the
[1:24:47.440 --> 1:24:51.720]  criminalities taking over and they're not going to stop, it's just going to grow and
[1:24:51.720 --> 1:24:56.040]  grow like a staff infection, like a flesh shooting bacteria, racing through the body
[1:24:56.040 --> 1:24:57.040]  politic.
[1:24:57.040 --> 1:25:00.680]  Tommy, you talked about how they kept trying to set you up in prison too.
[1:25:00.680 --> 1:25:11.560]  Yeah, I was offered a pot almost daily and I was in there, I guess I was in there for
[1:25:11.560 --> 1:25:20.760]  about two weeks and then a guy came up that I made friends with and he showed me a joint.
[1:25:20.760 --> 1:25:28.200]  But luckily I was with this old convict that had been down many times and he was sort of
[1:25:28.200 --> 1:25:34.120]  like my mentor, he was kind of hanging with me and making sure that I didn't get into
[1:25:34.120 --> 1:25:35.520]  trouble.
[1:25:35.520 --> 1:25:42.920]  And when he saw that, he told the guy to take off in so many words and then right after
[1:25:42.920 --> 1:25:52.240]  I got offered, they brought me up to the control area and they drug tested me because they
[1:25:52.240 --> 1:26:00.160]  really wanted, they really were hoping or expecting me to violate the prison rules by
[1:26:00.160 --> 1:26:06.800]  smoking up, they think, I guess they thought I was some kind of drug addict or something.
[1:26:06.800 --> 1:26:12.440]  Tommy Chung, I've got to tell you, I'm surprised that they didn't just plant somebody else's
[1:26:12.440 --> 1:26:17.320]  urine and say it was yours because I use the examples of Houston, Dallas, Chicago, but
[1:26:17.320 --> 1:26:18.320]  I use the Dallas one a lot.
[1:26:18.320 --> 1:26:21.680]  Did you hear about a few years ago, they'd pulled over thousands of nice cars, they'd
[1:26:21.680 --> 1:26:24.680]  throw chalk in the back and just take the car, I mean that's criminal.
[1:26:24.680 --> 1:26:29.920]  And then the whole department was involved, I mean this is scary and they would certify
[1:26:29.920 --> 1:26:31.920]  the choccus cocaine.
[1:26:31.920 --> 1:26:32.920]  Yeah.
[1:26:32.920 --> 1:26:35.200]  I mean that is ruthless, hardcore crime.
[1:26:35.200 --> 1:26:39.920]  What would you want to, let me tell you, let me tell you, probably the worst I've ever
[1:26:39.920 --> 1:26:47.280]  heard, it was in the prison that I was in was in Taft, California and the main prison,
[1:26:47.280 --> 1:26:51.000]  what they had, they had a couple of illegal aliens in there and they had them in there
[1:26:51.000 --> 1:26:56.440]  for a couple of years until the legal aliens learned how to speak enough English to tell
[1:26:56.440 --> 1:27:02.280]  their story and their story was this, they were outside a home depot looking for casual
[1:27:02.280 --> 1:27:10.520]  work and day work and the federal DEA guys came down and grabbed a couple of guys and
[1:27:10.520 --> 1:27:18.040]  said, you know, took them to an area, had them change into suit clothes, nice clothes
[1:27:18.040 --> 1:27:25.720]  and then they give them a bag of cocaine deposed with, with a pitcher and then they arrested
[1:27:25.720 --> 1:27:26.720]  them.
[1:27:26.720 --> 1:27:33.160]  Then they arrested them and charged them with, yeah and charged them with, you know, dealing
[1:27:33.160 --> 1:27:34.160]  cocaine.
[1:27:34.160 --> 1:27:35.160]  Yeah.
[1:27:35.160 --> 1:27:38.000]  In fact, Dallas, it started, they said, 10 years ago with the illegals and they moved
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:40.560]  on to everybody else because they know they can't defend themselves.
[1:27:40.560 --> 1:27:41.560]  You're absolutely right.
[1:27:41.560 --> 1:27:44.320]  And it's because they can't bust the real drug dealers because the government ships
[1:27:44.320 --> 1:27:45.720]  it in and gets a guide.
[1:27:45.720 --> 1:27:47.520]  So they've got to go bust innocent people.
[1:27:47.520 --> 1:27:48.520]  Yeah.
[1:27:48.520 --> 1:27:49.520]  Yeah.
[1:27:49.520 --> 1:27:50.520]  And that's exactly what they did.
[1:27:50.520 --> 1:27:52.080]  And that's the dangerous part.
[1:27:52.080 --> 1:27:56.440]  And the other, the other thing I heard, you know, when I was in jail, I had made friends
[1:27:56.440 --> 1:28:04.920]  with another lawyer from, from down south, you know, down Mexico way, even further down,
[1:28:04.920 --> 1:28:10.800]  I forget exactly which country he was in, Columbia, Columbia, he was from Columbia.
[1:28:10.800 --> 1:28:18.160]  And he's telling me about this, this plane, the DEA flies in and out of Columbia every
[1:28:18.160 --> 1:28:20.960]  day and it never gets searched.
[1:28:20.960 --> 1:28:26.040]  It's like, you know, I mean, who's going to search a DEA plane and, and they pick up
[1:28:26.040 --> 1:28:33.280]  loads of cocaine and drop it from Columbia, drive it, fly it right into, into America.
[1:28:33.280 --> 1:28:40.720]  Well they just had a few months ago, 4,000 tons of pure cocaine and a CIA owned aircraft
[1:28:40.720 --> 1:28:45.600]  that was doing rendition, torture flights, crash in Mexico filled with cocaine.
[1:28:45.600 --> 1:28:46.600]  Oh yeah.
[1:28:46.600 --> 1:28:47.600]  It went into scrap.
[1:28:47.600 --> 1:28:48.600]  Yeah.
[1:28:48.600 --> 1:28:49.600]  Well then that, that's the plane.
[1:28:49.600 --> 1:28:54.480]  I don't know the DEA CIA or who it is, but the guy, he, he's seen it.
[1:28:54.480 --> 1:28:56.440]  Well there's a whole bunch of them.
[1:28:56.440 --> 1:28:58.440]  I mean, it's like major deliveries.
[1:28:58.440 --> 1:28:59.440]  Yeah.
[1:28:59.440 --> 1:29:00.440]  Yeah.
[1:29:00.440 --> 1:29:05.480]  I mean, how do the police feel good taking kids to jail for a joint when they know the
[1:29:05.480 --> 1:29:07.400]  government brings the smack and cocaine?
[1:29:07.400 --> 1:29:10.200]  Well, they, they, that, that's the whole point.
[1:29:10.200 --> 1:29:13.440]  That's the whole point of, of a criminal mind.
[1:29:13.440 --> 1:29:18.320]  You see, that's, that's one thing you have to be very careful with, like if you tell
[1:29:18.320 --> 1:29:23.840]  one lie or you steal, you know, shop that's one little item, you, you, you enter a world
[1:29:23.840 --> 1:29:29.640]  of criminality that, that all, all it is is, is a matter of, of a scope.
[1:29:29.640 --> 1:29:31.160]  You know, how big is it going to be?
[1:29:31.160 --> 1:29:36.160]  You're going to steal, you know, like Rob, Rob Candy from a baby or you're going to
[1:29:36.160 --> 1:29:37.560]  rob a bank.
[1:29:37.560 --> 1:29:38.560]  Stay there Tommy Chong.
[1:29:38.560 --> 1:29:41.640]  Stay with us.

[1:29:51.200 --> 1:29:55.400]  The federal trade commission estimates that nine million Americans are victims of identity
[1:29:55.400 --> 1:29:56.560]  theft each year.
[1:29:56.560 --> 1:30:01.240]  The crime of identity theft occurs every 3.5 seconds costing the victims an average of

[1:31:06.440 --> 1:31:09.600]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:31:09.600 --> 1:31:15.520]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[1:31:15.520 --> 1:31:19.960]  of humanity is at hand.

[1:31:35.120 --> 1:31:36.120]  They're after power.

[1:33:01.040 --> 1:33:05.480]  Same government pushes Rital and Prozac just as serious, just as poisonous or more so on
[1:33:05.480 --> 1:33:06.480]  the kids.
[1:33:06.480 --> 1:33:12.360]  And when you see a real drug war, that is the US government and others waging war on
[1:33:12.360 --> 1:33:15.000]  the smaller drug cartels that they don't control.
[1:33:15.000 --> 1:33:20.920]  And that's what you're seeing on the Mexican border with the United States right now.
[1:33:20.920 --> 1:33:27.640]  And we've had CIA, DEA, FBI retired on, they've all been caught, it's all admitted.
[1:33:27.640 --> 1:33:31.040]  Tommy Chong is our gas, we'll fire out some websites.
[1:33:31.040 --> 1:33:35.600]  I've consulted on the film AmericanDrugWard.com, it's not available in stores for another three
[1:33:35.600 --> 1:33:39.640]  days, we've had it for a month because I'm a consultant on it in the extras.
[1:33:39.640 --> 1:33:43.760]  Three hours of extras in the film, two hour film, it's a big blockbuster on Showtime.
[1:33:43.760 --> 1:33:55.640]  The DVD is available at infowars.com by calling toll 388825331398882533139.
[1:33:55.640 --> 1:33:58.320]  Kevin Booth's gonna be riding shotgun when it's coming up in about 10, 15 minutes, it'll
[1:33:58.320 --> 1:34:00.040]  be with us into the next hour.
[1:34:00.040 --> 1:34:04.320]  Tommy Chong will be with us coming up until about five after next hour.
[1:34:04.320 --> 1:34:10.880]  We'll fire out AKA Tommy Chong, tell folks about the film that's being suppressed, tell
[1:34:10.880 --> 1:34:15.640]  folks about your different websites, your different groups, what people should visit
[1:34:15.640 --> 1:34:20.360]  and then let's get into the latest saga in the big brother Jack Booth's.
[1:34:20.360 --> 1:34:30.520]  Well, the AKA Tommy Chong is available on that website akatommychong.com and he grabbed
[1:34:30.520 --> 1:34:36.480]  the Spectrum Labs, they busted Spectrum Labs, a drug testing company and they grabbed, you
[1:34:36.480 --> 1:34:41.080]  know, I don't know how many DVDs, you know, thousands, I'm not sure because they won't,
[1:34:41.080 --> 1:34:47.120]  the feds won't even tell us why they're busting the labs, you know, there's a sealed indictment,
[1:34:47.120 --> 1:34:52.000]  whatever that means and but you can get it at akatommychong.com.
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:57.720]  We were on Amazon, I don't know, I think the feds took it off Amazon or whatever.
[1:34:57.720 --> 1:35:03.640]  I'm not sure but the reason, one of the reasons they don't want you to see it is the Attorney
[1:35:03.640 --> 1:35:11.320]  General or the prosecuting attorney that went after me, Mary Beth Buchanan, she's featured
[1:35:11.320 --> 1:35:16.680]  prominently in the film and she probably has the funniest line in the film.
[1:35:16.680 --> 1:35:23.080]  She gets the biggest laugh, you know, when she starts explaining to the press how a
[1:35:23.080 --> 1:35:32.680]  bong works, I mean, it's pretty ludicrous, pretty funny, yeah, it's great and but, you
[1:35:32.680 --> 1:35:39.280]  know, they, I was told, you know, when they sentenced me, you know, that I'm not to profit
[1:35:39.280 --> 1:35:44.200]  from my crime in any way, you know, don't make any movies, don't do anything, anything,
[1:35:44.200 --> 1:35:48.320]  you know, and you know, my lawyer said, well, you know, they can't tell you not to make
[1:35:48.320 --> 1:35:55.440]  a living, you know, and you make a living doing movies, you know, but still in all,
[1:35:55.440 --> 1:36:00.860]  I still don't trust these people, so I don't have any interest in the film, you know, monetary
[1:36:00.860 --> 1:36:02.360]  interest at all.
[1:36:02.360 --> 1:36:05.880]  I'm just, you know, I just want my story to get up.
[1:36:05.880 --> 1:36:07.800]  Well, Tommy, that's your first amendment, right?
[1:36:07.800 --> 1:36:11.880]  Let's, and I love that line you said on local news, when they raided the place and grabbed,
[1:36:11.880 --> 1:36:16.400]  they reported 10,000 DVDs, most of the ones you guys had had printed or that separate
[1:36:16.400 --> 1:36:21.240]  company had, and then they had you say, oh no, I'm not profiting from my first amendment
[1:36:21.240 --> 1:36:22.240]  being suppressed.
[1:36:22.240 --> 1:36:24.240]  That's exactly it.
[1:36:24.240 --> 1:36:27.400]  No, I'm not profiting at all in that one.
[1:36:27.400 --> 1:36:29.080]  Well, talk about a conflict of interest.
[1:36:29.080 --> 1:36:32.920]  Talk about Jack booted, right out of Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia.
[1:36:32.920 --> 1:36:39.520]  She has had them raid the very film, She's the Villain in, I mean, this is unbelievable.
[1:36:39.520 --> 1:36:41.520]  Isn't that something?
[1:36:41.520 --> 1:36:42.520]  Yeah.
[1:36:42.520 --> 1:36:49.440]  Yeah, she's quite a loose cannon, you know, Mary Beth loose cannon, but, you know, she's
[1:36:49.440 --> 1:36:56.160]  on the, you know, she's just, you know, the talking head for, for the Bush administration
[1:36:56.160 --> 1:37:02.960]  and the guns, all of Europe and the Ashcroft, you know, all these guys, even they even made
[1:37:02.960 --> 1:37:08.280]  Ashcroft back off, you know, or, or quit because they, they got so ridiculous.
[1:37:08.280 --> 1:37:09.280]  So far.
[1:37:09.280 --> 1:37:11.560]  I was talking to a well-known rock star, that's all I'm going to say.
[1:37:11.560 --> 1:37:13.400]  I've been around, even tell a story.
[1:37:13.400 --> 1:37:14.400]  It doesn't even matter.
[1:37:14.400 --> 1:37:17.520]  Let's just say this, I can't tell a story.
[1:37:17.520 --> 1:37:20.240]  I mean, Gonzalez is just unbelievable.
[1:37:20.240 --> 1:37:21.400]  That's all I'm going to say.
[1:37:21.400 --> 1:37:23.280]  These people are such hypocrites.
[1:37:23.280 --> 1:37:24.280]  Yeah.
[1:37:24.280 --> 1:37:25.280]  Yeah.
[1:37:25.280 --> 1:37:28.160]  That's, that's the best, the working work.
[1:37:28.160 --> 1:37:29.160]  It goes beyond that.
[1:37:29.160 --> 1:37:30.160]  They're evil.
[1:37:30.160 --> 1:37:35.000]  I mean, they're, they're into the, you, you, you have to start believing that these people
[1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:36.080]  are the enemy.
[1:37:36.080 --> 1:37:41.280]  You know, they are the people that they're supposed to, we're fighting against, you
[1:37:41.280 --> 1:37:43.000]  know, because you have to think about this.
[1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:47.600]  Why don't they have a, a, a bin Laden?
[1:37:47.600 --> 1:37:49.000]  You know, why haven't they captured him?
[1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:53.400]  You know, this most powerful nation on earth and, and we, we don't have the people to go
[1:37:53.400 --> 1:37:56.120]  in and find this guy and take him out.
[1:37:56.120 --> 1:38:00.880]  I mean, there's, it seems that, that he's being protected and how come every time, you
[1:38:00.880 --> 1:38:05.960]  know, the, the, the Democrats start surging ahead and, and, and the Bush boys, you know,
[1:38:05.960 --> 1:38:10.640]  they need a, a boogeyman, all of a sudden bin Laden comes up with another tape.
[1:38:10.640 --> 1:38:15.920]  You know, Austin, he's addressing the American people again, you know, it's as if, it's
[1:38:15.920 --> 1:38:22.960]  as if that, that bin Laden needs the Bush people and the Bush people need in order for
[1:38:22.960 --> 1:38:24.360]  both of them to exist.
[1:38:24.360 --> 1:38:28.320]  Well, well, Tommy, I've got quite a few video guys here in my office, a couple of them have
[1:38:28.320 --> 1:38:29.800]  degrees in it.
[1:38:29.800 --> 1:38:35.160]  And we had blown up from the news, the original source videos, uh, the, the different bin
[1:38:35.160 --> 1:38:40.880]  Laden tapes, and we, we had noticed, because you can see in the pixelation when you blow
[1:38:40.880 --> 1:38:44.160]  them up, I didn't blow up as big as you want down to per pixel, uh, fill up the screen
[1:38:44.160 --> 1:38:51.000]  that they had, we're laying in the Al Qaeda, uh, supposed watermarks, uh, in at the same
[1:38:51.000 --> 1:38:54.720]  time as the Intel center, uh, and others.
[1:38:54.720 --> 1:38:58.440]  And then later a top video analyst told Wired Magazine, he, he put it out and showed it
[1:38:58.440 --> 1:39:03.440]  with his program that indeed it was the same, he got pressured to say, well, it's inconclusive,
[1:39:03.440 --> 1:39:08.320]  but we already had caught them from government servers uploading the original Al Qaeda videos.
[1:39:08.320 --> 1:39:14.600]  And then, uh, right when, uh, we saw on, on the eve of the war, when Colin Powell, Secretary
[1:39:14.600 --> 1:39:19.080]  of State, before the UN and then before Congress, he says, yeah, bin Laden works with Saddam
[1:39:19.080 --> 1:39:20.480]  Hussein, which has admitted fraud.
[1:39:20.480 --> 1:39:24.200]  And he said, yeah, bin Laden has put out a new tape agreeing to that.
[1:39:24.200 --> 1:39:27.280]  And they, the media all ran out and came back and said, it hadn't been released yet.
[1:39:27.280 --> 1:39:29.560]  And he said, Oh, it'll be in a few hours.
[1:39:29.560 --> 1:39:31.520]  They even got their time zones wrong.
[1:39:31.520 --> 1:39:37.400]  Just like they were announcing Lee Harvey Oswald had, uh, killed, uh, JFK before he'd
[1:39:37.400 --> 1:39:39.360]  even been arrested and his name was out.
[1:39:39.360 --> 1:39:44.680]  That was in the New Zealand and Australian and, and, and, uh, you know, foreign papers.
[1:39:44.680 --> 1:39:47.320]  I mean, it's, it's, it's unbelievable.
[1:39:47.320 --> 1:39:48.320]  It's all orchestrated.
[1:39:48.320 --> 1:39:49.320]  Yeah.
[1:39:49.320 --> 1:39:50.320]  Yeah.
[1:39:50.320 --> 1:39:54.560]  And, and, and that's why, uh, you know, that's why that was probably the main reason that
[1:39:54.560 --> 1:40:01.680]  they, uh, railroaded me into, into prison, you know, be, made me become a, become a,
[1:40:01.680 --> 1:40:06.800]  uh, a Fallon, you know, uh, because, because I realized, you know, I was on talk radio
[1:40:06.800 --> 1:40:12.040]  like I'm on now and I was just speaking my mind and, and I, and I, and I was, happened
[1:40:12.040 --> 1:40:16.920]  to be in St. Louis where, you know, Ashcroft and the boys are, are at and, and they love
[1:40:16.920 --> 1:40:22.400]  me on, on this talk radio, you know, it was a very right wing talk show and, and I happened
[1:40:22.400 --> 1:40:28.800]  to be on that show speaking my mind and the thing is, man, it's so orchestrated, such
[1:40:28.800 --> 1:40:34.040]  a dance that even, even the right wing people, you know, that's spout all this crap.
[1:40:34.040 --> 1:40:35.040]  They don't believe it.
[1:40:35.040 --> 1:40:38.880]  You know, they're just, they're just following the, the party line, you know, just what
[1:40:38.880 --> 1:40:43.240]  they're going to, you know, they're just going in saying what they're told to say.
[1:40:43.240 --> 1:40:48.880]  Well, and you're right, the phony right wing likes to have a snack or, or something to
[1:40:48.880 --> 1:40:52.040]  show the public, oh look, we even got Tommy John.
[1:40:52.040 --> 1:40:56.080]  They love that because it creates fear and you've got what, 20-something states that
[1:40:56.080 --> 1:40:58.280]  have passed laws legalizing marijuana.
[1:40:58.280 --> 1:41:02.760]  So the feds come in and say, no, you can't do that and, and what Kevin Booth always brings
[1:41:02.760 --> 1:41:07.920]  up the number and I've seen it in the government's own numbers, 87% of drug users only smoke
[1:41:07.920 --> 1:41:09.000]  marijuana.
[1:41:09.000 --> 1:41:13.160]  Their drug war, their fraud is over if they don't have marijuana to persecute.
[1:41:13.160 --> 1:41:14.160]  Oh yeah.
[1:41:14.160 --> 1:41:15.160]  Yeah.
[1:41:15.160 --> 1:41:21.680]  Well, the marijuana is just the, it's just a thinly disguised racist law that, that
[1:41:21.680 --> 1:41:26.920]  the government is just every, and everybody in government, including, you know, the black,
[1:41:26.920 --> 1:41:32.560]  uh, you know, Republicans, all of them, they, they have no idea what, what a Jim Crow, what
[1:41:32.560 --> 1:41:38.440]  a racist law that they're, they're, they're supporting because they're so ignorant about
[1:41:38.440 --> 1:41:39.440]  it.
[1:41:39.440 --> 1:41:45.400]  Well, what about how a 15 year old black kid that has a 10th of a gram will get 5, 10 years
[1:41:45.400 --> 1:41:50.000]  in prison for cocaine, but a lawyer can have, uh, you know, 50 times that amount.
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:52.960]  The laws are even written to go after minorities.
[1:41:52.960 --> 1:41:55.120]  Oh, totally, totally, totally.
[1:41:55.120 --> 1:42:01.840]  I just read, uh, just recently the, um, they busted a methamphetamine, uh, a lab and what
[1:42:01.840 --> 1:42:06.640]  they did, they, they found chemicals, you know, uh, and, and what they did, the government
[1:42:06.640 --> 1:42:12.160]  broke down the chemicals into hits and so they come up with some, some ridiculous number,
[1:42:12.160 --> 1:42:18.120]  like 25 million hits of methamphetamine and you get your, your sentence depends on how
[1:42:18.120 --> 1:42:19.920]  much drugs that you're dealing.
[1:42:19.920 --> 1:42:21.560]  So now it's not just drugs.
[1:42:21.560 --> 1:42:26.640]  It's the precursor, uh, chemicals are trying to claim that you get prison time for it.
[1:42:26.640 --> 1:42:27.640]  Yeah.
[1:42:27.640 --> 1:42:28.640]  Yeah.
[1:42:28.640 --> 1:42:29.640]  That, that's exactly what it is.
[1:42:29.640 --> 1:42:33.680]  And they got the time they got these people who got, you know, I'm not a meth fan at all.
[1:42:33.680 --> 1:42:36.640]  You know, and I, I, you know, I, it's horrible.
[1:42:36.640 --> 1:42:37.640]  Speed kills.
[1:42:37.640 --> 1:42:38.640]  Uh, yeah.
[1:42:38.640 --> 1:42:39.640]  It's, it's terrible.
[1:42:39.640 --> 1:42:43.400]  I've seen it in, you know, the, in prison, a lot of them in there, you know, recuperating
[1:42:43.400 --> 1:42:45.160]  from the effects of it.
[1:42:45.160 --> 1:42:52.640]  But the kind of time that these guys get it, it's mind boggling because, uh, you know,
[1:42:52.640 --> 1:42:58.640]  compared to the, the crimes that you are committed by the, by the, uh, you know, so-called right
[1:42:58.640 --> 1:43:04.360]  wing, uh, uh, you know, where they're, well, you, you look at what Bush has done and all
[1:43:04.360 --> 1:43:10.160]  these guys, they violated the very, you know, the Bible, they, they swore to uphold the
[1:43:10.160 --> 1:43:11.160]  Constitution.
[1:43:11.160 --> 1:43:16.480]  They put their hand on the Bible and the hand on their heart and they swore to uphold the
[1:43:16.480 --> 1:43:23.840]  Constitution of the United States and then they went out and systematically violated
[1:43:23.840 --> 1:43:29.440]  that Constitution that they did and, and, and by, you know, and that's what they did.
[1:43:29.440 --> 1:43:33.520]  That's the only oath that you have to, you know, that if they wanted to impeach or imprison
[1:43:33.520 --> 1:43:36.160]  any of these guys, that's all you have to show.
[1:43:36.160 --> 1:43:40.040]  You just have to show them, you know, swear and being sworn into office because that's
[1:43:40.040 --> 1:43:42.120]  why they swear these people into office.
[1:43:42.120 --> 1:43:43.120]  Well, you're right.
[1:43:43.120 --> 1:43:44.120]  Yeah.
[1:43:44.120 --> 1:43:48.680]  That's why law enforcement, you know, they have to swear to uphold the laws and when
[1:43:48.680 --> 1:43:51.240]  they get caught, they do serious time.
[1:43:51.240 --> 1:43:53.800]  So it's a matter of time before these guys are going to get caught.
[1:43:53.800 --> 1:43:58.840]  Well, Tommy Chong, if we just step back and look at a Taser death every day and then Taser
[1:43:58.840 --> 1:44:03.560]  sues the medical examiners and, and, and doctors and says, you can't say that our Taser is
[1:44:03.560 --> 1:44:05.840]  killing people even though they die right after they're shocked.
[1:44:05.840 --> 1:44:12.560]  Yeah, I mean, if we look at, at, at, at how they're putting people in jail for now falling
[1:44:12.560 --> 1:44:17.320]  asleep at their desk, first offense in school, I mean, if we look at how that they treat
[1:44:17.320 --> 1:44:23.000]  us and yell at us now, I mean, I remember 10 years ago, if there was a wreck on the
[1:44:23.000 --> 1:44:26.720]  road, the cops would wave you around and wouldn't smile at you, but now they'll just scream
[1:44:26.720 --> 1:44:27.960]  at you like you're scum.
[1:44:27.960 --> 1:44:31.480]  I mean, it's like governments turned into mad dog maniacs.
[1:44:31.480 --> 1:44:32.480]  Oh, it's terrible.
[1:44:32.480 --> 1:44:35.800]  Well, you know, when I was incarcerated, they had, they had a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,
[1:44:35.800 --> 1:44:38.640]  a, what it was called, Valley fever warning.
[1:44:38.640 --> 1:44:43.560]  I don't know if I talked about this last time, but anyway, what it is, it's, it's a,
[1:44:43.560 --> 1:44:49.080]  it, when the wind picks up in the desert, you know, the jail is in the desert something
[1:44:49.080 --> 1:44:50.080]  happens.
[1:44:50.080 --> 1:44:55.480]  I think it, because they built the jail over some toxic waste dumps and, and this, the
[1:44:55.480 --> 1:45:02.280]  air is toxic and people that have been incarcerated, they, they developed some of the, the, the,
[1:45:02.280 --> 1:45:10.280]  It's a wasting disease where you start off with like 180 pounds and you're down to 130.
[1:45:10.280 --> 1:45:17.640]  Like a skeleton, there's people that look like they're in Auschwitz, death camps.
[1:45:17.640 --> 1:45:24.160]  And when I was in there, this one victim of this valley fever was dying in his bunk and
[1:45:24.160 --> 1:45:25.440]  no one would help him.
[1:45:25.440 --> 1:45:27.040]  The guards wouldn't help him.
[1:45:27.040 --> 1:45:31.360]  Nobody would come to his aid and the prisoners can't.
[1:45:31.360 --> 1:45:33.040]  And finally, he was going to die.
[1:45:33.040 --> 1:45:35.840]  He knew he was going to die, so he staggered up himself.
[1:45:35.840 --> 1:45:36.840]  He stood up.
[1:45:36.840 --> 1:45:45.640]  He was on the second floor and he staggered to the stairs and then they put him in a little
[1:45:45.640 --> 1:45:50.320]  jeep and they took him over to the main hospital and he died the next morning.
[1:45:50.320 --> 1:45:54.440]  And then they cremated his body immediately.
[1:45:54.440 --> 1:45:59.720]  No autopsy, no notifying Mexican nothing.
[1:45:59.720 --> 1:46:00.720]  They just...
[1:46:00.720 --> 1:46:03.800]  Yeah, we're living in a giant death camp.
[1:46:03.800 --> 1:46:07.880]  I have all the government documents where they just take and poison and kill and sterilize
[1:46:07.880 --> 1:46:10.800]  all the natives on reservations, still ongoing.
[1:46:10.800 --> 1:46:11.800]  It's all eugenics.
[1:46:11.800 --> 1:46:16.160]  I mean, the public thinks that I'm like sometimes exaggerating.
[1:46:16.160 --> 1:46:17.160]  I'm not.
[1:46:17.160 --> 1:46:20.680]  It's so bad you can't even explain it to people.
[1:46:20.680 --> 1:46:23.120]  It is so monstrous, Tommy.
[1:46:23.120 --> 1:46:24.120]  I know.
[1:46:24.120 --> 1:46:25.120]  I know.
[1:46:25.120 --> 1:46:26.120]  I saw it firsthand.
[1:46:26.120 --> 1:46:27.120]  That's why.
[1:46:27.120 --> 1:46:32.360]  You know, the inmates in there, they had a Christmas show and they wanted me to perform
[1:46:32.360 --> 1:46:34.440]  at it and I was going to.
[1:46:34.440 --> 1:46:36.160]  And then I started thinking about it.
[1:46:36.160 --> 1:46:37.440]  You know, I'm in jail.
[1:46:37.440 --> 1:46:40.520]  You know, I don't have any rights at all.
[1:46:40.520 --> 1:46:44.880]  And if I were to get up and just say the wrong anything, or even the fact...
[1:46:44.880 --> 1:46:45.880]  They'll kill you.
[1:46:45.880 --> 1:46:46.880]  They'll kill you.
[1:46:46.880 --> 1:46:47.880]  They'll kill you.
[1:46:47.880 --> 1:46:48.880]  Yeah, I got up.
[1:46:48.880 --> 1:46:49.880]  They...
[1:46:49.880 --> 1:46:54.800]  I'm at risk, you know, because they can even expose you to that belly fever thing.
[1:46:54.800 --> 1:46:55.800]  You know, they can leave you.
[1:46:55.800 --> 1:46:59.080]  Tommy, let me tell you, it's not at Huntsville.
[1:46:59.080 --> 1:47:00.080]  It's all admitted.
[1:47:00.080 --> 1:47:01.080]  And it's all...
[1:47:01.080 --> 1:47:04.160]  They do biological chemical weapons test at thousands of the prisons.
[1:47:04.160 --> 1:47:06.240]  The guards even get sick and die from it.
[1:47:06.240 --> 1:47:07.240]  And they...
[1:47:07.240 --> 1:47:08.240]  Believe me, sir.
[1:47:08.240 --> 1:47:12.280]  And in fact, if you want to continue some news articles on it, it's probably something
[1:47:12.280 --> 1:47:16.840]  else going on there at the facility, what you just described, a lot of government weapons
[1:47:16.840 --> 1:47:17.840]  testing going on.
[1:47:17.840 --> 1:47:18.840]  I mean...
[1:47:18.840 --> 1:47:19.840]  Yep.
[1:47:19.840 --> 1:47:22.000]  Now, I want to go to Kevin Booth and then we only...
[1:47:22.000 --> 1:47:23.560]  The time flies so fast now.
[1:47:23.560 --> 1:47:26.000]  He really been gracious to give us all this time, Tommy.
[1:47:26.000 --> 1:47:31.200]  But getting back into 9-11, not just all the evidence of how criminal elements of the government
[1:47:31.200 --> 1:47:35.680]  did it, but the way they've profited, the way they've had trillions of no-bid contracts,
[1:47:35.680 --> 1:47:40.000]  trillions, three trillion now, and I mean, the way they've taken our freedom, the way
[1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:44.120]  they've shifted our economy over into police state.
[1:47:44.120 --> 1:47:45.120]  Can you speak to that?
[1:47:45.120 --> 1:47:47.640]  Well, you think about it.
[1:47:47.640 --> 1:47:54.320]  They...who owns Bush in the Saudis?
[1:47:54.320 --> 1:48:06.960]  So it goes right into the international field and people...and they throw John McCain in
[1:48:06.960 --> 1:48:15.040]  front of your face, just to...almost as if they're flaunting it.
[1:48:15.040 --> 1:48:16.360]  They've got that.
[1:48:16.360 --> 1:48:20.720]  But here, you know, we talk about the horrors of these people.
[1:48:20.720 --> 1:48:26.920]  You know, like Hitler...it took Hitler a lot more years than just the war years.
[1:48:26.920 --> 1:48:33.960]  You know, Hitler was a...he came up through the ranks and he was very innovative as far
[1:48:33.960 --> 1:48:45.440]  as knowing how to have people get afraid and then finding a boogeyman for these people.
[1:48:45.440 --> 1:48:48.040]  And that's what it is, you know.
[1:48:48.040 --> 1:48:52.240]  You have to find the hippies, you have to find the...at one time it was the blacks and
[1:48:52.240 --> 1:48:57.200]  now it's the Hispanics, you know, these people sneaking into their own country, you know,
[1:48:57.200 --> 1:49:00.520]  they're going to do us harm, you know.
[1:49:00.520 --> 1:49:09.680]  It's all this fear tactic, but it's education and the thing that saved me was my knowledge
[1:49:09.680 --> 1:49:21.440]  of the goodness of the universe because this universe, you can live in it and you can be
[1:49:21.440 --> 1:49:28.760]  as evil as you want and all you're going to do is create an opposite force that is the
[1:49:28.760 --> 1:49:30.000]  real force.
[1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:31.880]  It's not really an opposite force.
[1:49:31.880 --> 1:49:33.280]  There's no duality.
[1:49:33.280 --> 1:49:37.680]  There's only one truth and that one truth will ring through.
[1:49:37.680 --> 1:49:47.000]  That one truth saved me, it took me through that whole labor of deception and fraud and
[1:49:47.000 --> 1:49:52.640]  evilness and brought me to this point and that's the way this universe works.
[1:49:52.640 --> 1:50:00.160]  And so no matter how much we see the evilness, we can't...it's nothing.
[1:50:00.160 --> 1:50:04.680]  It's an illusion, just like wealth is an illusion, you know.
[1:50:04.680 --> 1:50:06.360]  Like Ted Kennedy will tell you that.
[1:50:06.360 --> 1:50:15.400]  No matter how rich he is and how wealthy and how many boats he has, he's only got one body
[1:50:15.400 --> 1:50:19.760]  and when that body is ready to go, it goes.
[1:50:19.760 --> 1:50:23.560]  And there's nothing...no one can...your wealth can't save you there, you know.
[1:50:23.560 --> 1:50:28.160]  And that's what all these people are going to find out and they're going to find out,
[1:50:28.160 --> 1:50:35.160]  you know, in the worst possible manner and rather than to be afraid of these people,
[1:50:35.160 --> 1:50:41.560]  we have to really, you know, find in our heart to love them and to feel sorry for them.
[1:50:41.560 --> 1:50:43.080]  Tommy Chong, amazing.
[1:50:43.080 --> 1:50:44.080]  Let's come back with Kevin Booth.
[1:50:44.080 --> 1:50:45.600]  This is unbelievable.
[1:50:45.600 --> 1:50:46.600]  This is really powerful.
[1:50:46.600 --> 1:50:47.600]  Stop.
[1:50:47.600 --> 1:50:48.600]  Stay with us.
[1:50:48.600 --> 1:50:56.360]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause
[1:50:56.360 --> 1:50:59.040]  of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[1:50:59.040 --> 1:51:03.080]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment and
[1:51:03.080 --> 1:51:04.800]  our high stress lifestyles.
[1:51:04.800 --> 1:51:08.920]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain and eventually disease.
[1:51:08.920 --> 1:51:13.400]  The easiest way to reduce disease causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized
[1:51:13.400 --> 1:51:14.400]  water.
[1:51:14.400 --> 1:51:18.880]  At SnyderHealth.com we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science,

[1:51:51.280 --> 1:51:53.240]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[1:51:53.240 --> 1:51:57.760]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide, but in Liberty's darkest
[1:51:57.760 --> 1:51:59.320]  hour there is hope.
[1:51:59.320 --> 1:52:02.960]  The first time in modern history the people are beginning to wake up, it is essential
[1:52:02.960 --> 1:52:07.080]  that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order
[1:52:07.080 --> 1:52:08.080]  Master Plan.
[1:52:08.080 --> 1:52:12.360]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[1:52:12.360 --> 1:52:17.720]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[1:52:17.720 --> 1:52:20.600]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.
[1:52:20.600 --> 1:52:25.160]  All 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded or streamed in super high quality directly

[1:52:37.360 --> 1:52:38.360]  and so much more.

[1:52:51.360 --> 1:52:55.880]  According to the EPA, our indoor air is many times more polluted than outdoor air.
[1:52:55.880 --> 1:52:59.640]  One child in 10 suffers from asthma, how can we improve the air we breathe?
[1:52:59.640 --> 1:53:03.520]  The answer is clear, Himalayan crystal salt lamps from Ionic salts.
[1:53:03.520 --> 1:53:07.560]  These lamps naturally improve indoor air quality without adding toxic ozone.
[1:53:07.560 --> 1:53:11.280]  Lighted Himalayan crystal salt lamps neutralize allergens and irritants in the air including
[1:53:11.280 --> 1:53:16.600]  dander, pollen, mold and fungi and are effective in reducing symptoms of asthma, allergies,
[1:53:16.600 --> 1:53:19.680]  headaches and airborne vapors from paint, furniture and carpeting.
[1:53:19.680 --> 1:53:24.400]  Ionic salts provides premium quality lamps, handcrafted from salt which has been in solid
[1:53:24.400 --> 1:53:27.200]  form for 215 million years.

[1:53:53.040 --> 1:53:58.200]  The police were never involved in your business 50, 60, 100 years ago unless it was a murder
[1:53:58.200 --> 1:53:59.960]  or a crime.
[1:53:59.960 --> 1:54:00.960]  Now they've got an excuse.
[1:54:00.960 --> 1:54:07.000]  They're looking for drugs, something that's addictive, something people want and of course
[1:54:07.000 --> 1:54:09.800]  they're going to also be in control of that business because they're the only ones that
[1:54:09.800 --> 1:54:10.800]  can be.
[1:54:10.800 --> 1:54:16.480]  And a low level poor cop on the ground getting shot by some crackhead, he's not.
[1:54:16.480 --> 1:54:17.480]  It's a trap.
[1:54:17.480 --> 1:54:19.680]  They put it out for you and you take the bait, they get you.
[1:54:19.680 --> 1:54:22.960]  Now we're about to go to Kevin Booth for this segment and the next holding him over with
[1:54:22.960 --> 1:54:25.560]  us when we've got another guest coming on about the tasers.
[1:54:25.560 --> 1:54:29.240]  But Tommy Chong is our guest, aka TommyChung.com is the film.
[1:54:29.240 --> 1:54:32.720]  Mr. Chong, fire out some of your websites, your comedian website.
[1:54:32.720 --> 1:54:34.160]  You've also got a book coming out in August.
[1:54:34.160 --> 1:54:35.160]  Tell us about that.
[1:54:35.160 --> 1:54:42.440]  Well, yeah, I wrote an unauthorized autobiography of Cheech and Chong because Cheech and I
[1:54:42.440 --> 1:54:46.480]  were on the outs for so many years and I just wrote a book about it.
[1:54:46.480 --> 1:54:53.080]  And now the funny thing is we're going back on tour in the fall and in fact I'm meeting
[1:54:53.080 --> 1:54:55.360]  him later on in a couple of hours.
[1:54:55.360 --> 1:55:01.600]  We're going to talk about a grill called Up in Smoke, something like the George Foreman
[1:55:01.600 --> 1:55:02.600]  Grill.
[1:55:02.600 --> 1:55:06.200]  It's going to be Cheech and Chong's Up in Smoke Grill.
[1:55:06.200 --> 1:55:08.840]  I wonder if the government will raid that.
[1:55:08.840 --> 1:55:09.840]  Probably.
[1:55:09.840 --> 1:55:13.840]  You'll see the smoke, you'll think, well when there's smoke and there's Chong, there's
[1:55:13.840 --> 1:55:15.360]  something else being burned.
[1:55:15.360 --> 1:55:18.680]  Well, so you guys are just about to have your reunion today?
[1:55:18.680 --> 1:55:23.240]  Yeah, we're going to meet today actually in a couple of hours.
[1:55:23.240 --> 1:55:29.080]  I want to give you guys some time to get back to being pals, but please let me get you and
[1:55:29.080 --> 1:55:31.800]  Cheech for your first big radio interview here.
[1:55:31.800 --> 1:55:34.600]  A couple million listeners will, oh please come on here.
[1:55:34.600 --> 1:55:36.960]  Yeah, well, we'll give you the scoop.
[1:55:36.960 --> 1:55:38.960]  You'll be the first to get it.
[1:55:38.960 --> 1:55:39.960]  Man, you are the best.
[1:55:39.960 --> 1:55:44.480]  Now, fire out your own personal website, not just aka TommyChung.com.
[1:55:44.480 --> 1:55:50.680]  Well, the one I'm on, or I'm going to be on, live video.
[1:55:50.680 --> 1:55:58.120]  It's the TommyChung.com on live video, so that's when I'm working on now.
[1:55:58.120 --> 1:56:05.080]  It's going to be an interactive, you know, where we talk to the people and we put programs
[1:56:05.080 --> 1:56:06.080]  on.
[1:56:06.080 --> 1:56:11.040]  I'm going to have programs like Funny Skits that we do, like I did on YouTube for a while.
[1:56:11.040 --> 1:56:14.640]  I had one looking for a Mexican.
[1:56:14.640 --> 1:56:20.360]  Well, I mean, all you do is Google TommyChung and there's just millions of things pop up.
[1:56:20.360 --> 1:56:21.360]  Absolutely amazing.
[1:56:21.360 --> 1:56:24.560]  Now, I'm going to go to Kevin Booth here for just a moment while you're on.
[1:56:24.560 --> 1:56:28.840]  I appreciate him holding the maker of americadrugwar.com that you're in.
[1:56:28.840 --> 1:56:34.720]  But just in closing, we want to be clear, they've seized the DVD aka TommyChung.com,
[1:56:34.720 --> 1:56:38.240]  but some are still available at aka TommyChung.com.
[1:56:38.240 --> 1:56:39.440]  They do not want you to see this.
[1:56:39.440 --> 1:56:44.480]  The woman who had it seized is the woman that's the villain in it and it's a sealed
[1:56:44.480 --> 1:56:45.480]  indictment.
[1:56:45.480 --> 1:56:46.480]  It's like Kafka.
[1:56:46.480 --> 1:56:48.200]  They won't let you know what the secret crime is.
[1:56:48.200 --> 1:56:49.200]  Yeah, that's it.
[1:56:49.200 --> 1:56:50.200]  That's it.
[1:56:50.200 --> 1:56:55.960]  And it's under investigation and they said the investigation could take as long as 15
[1:56:55.960 --> 1:56:56.960]  years.
[1:56:56.960 --> 1:56:57.960]  Amazing.
[1:56:57.960 --> 1:57:02.320]  When does the Cheech and Chong reunion term start?
[1:57:02.320 --> 1:57:03.320]  In the fall sometime.
[1:57:03.320 --> 1:57:06.080]  I don't have an exact date, but it's going to be huge.
[1:57:06.080 --> 1:57:07.080]  That's going to be huge.
[1:57:07.080 --> 1:57:11.320]  I mean, you guys have always, you guys have always been huge, but it's like retro so big
[1:57:11.320 --> 1:57:12.320]  again.
[1:57:12.320 --> 1:57:13.320]  I'm sure you know that.
[1:57:13.320 --> 1:57:14.320]  Yeah.
[1:57:14.320 --> 1:57:15.320]  Yeah.
[1:57:15.320 --> 1:57:16.320]  That's one of the reasons we're back.
[1:57:16.320 --> 1:57:22.040]  You know, we had a, you know, barrier differences and suck it up and light up and toke up and
[1:57:22.040 --> 1:57:23.040]  do it again.
[1:57:23.040 --> 1:57:26.320]  Hey, Kevin Booth, this is a, this is amazing stuff.
[1:57:26.320 --> 1:57:29.440]  Few guests have me actually speechless, but Tommy Chung's amazing.
[1:57:29.440 --> 1:57:31.800]  I appreciate you hooking me up with him, Kevin.
[1:57:31.800 --> 1:57:32.800]  Anytime.
[1:57:32.800 --> 1:57:35.440]  And you know, with Tommy, I'll say, hey, Tommy, how's it going?
[1:57:35.440 --> 1:57:36.960]  Hey, how are you doing, Kevin?
[1:57:36.960 --> 1:57:37.960]  Good.
[1:57:37.960 --> 1:57:38.960]  Good to talk to you again.
[1:57:38.960 --> 1:57:42.280]  You know, I just, I wanted to talk while Tommy was on there just about what I had to go
[1:57:42.280 --> 1:57:46.040]  through to be able to get into a prison while Tommy was in there.
[1:57:46.040 --> 1:57:51.440]  I mean, it took four months and I actually had to have Alex's help there giving me,
[1:57:51.440 --> 1:57:53.040]  you know, FCC licenses.
[1:57:53.040 --> 1:57:57.520]  Every time the prison and Taft would get back with me and tell me that I, you know, had
[1:57:57.520 --> 1:58:01.040]  been okayed and we would actually book our flights and book hotels.
[1:58:01.040 --> 1:58:04.040]  I'd have to call, I'd have to send them corporate documents.
[1:58:04.040 --> 1:58:06.960]  Ted Anderson would have to call to prove it was media.
[1:58:06.960 --> 1:58:07.960]  Stay there, Kevin.
[1:58:07.960 --> 1:58:12.000]  Back in 60 seconds, final five minutes with Tommy Chung, ladies and gentlemen, then Kevin
[1:58:12.000 --> 1:58:14.320]  Booth's going to ride shotgun for the rest of the hour with us.
[1:58:14.320 --> 1:58:18.920]  We've got the head of the medical examiner association coming on who has outraged it.
[1:58:18.920 --> 1:58:21.840]  They're saying doctors and medical examiners can't say tasers kill you.
[1:58:21.840 --> 1:58:23.480]  A judge is gagging them.
[1:58:23.480 --> 1:58:25.120]  I mean, this is insane.
[1:58:25.120 --> 1:58:32.680]  Tommy Chung, our amazing guest, stay with us.
[1:58:32.680 --> 1:58:41.680]  If you are listening to GCN, visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:41.680 --> 1:58:45.920]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[1:58:45.920 --> 1:58:50.360]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:58:50.360 --> 1:58:56.480]  It's known as the Builder Bird, but their objective being world domination.
[1:58:56.480 --> 1:58:59.640]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:58:59.640 --> 1:59:04.640]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating
[1:59:04.640 --> 1:59:10.040]  80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:59:10.040 --> 1:59:15.440]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[1:59:15.440 --> 1:59:19.280]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[1:59:19.280 --> 1:59:22.000]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[1:59:22.000 --> 1:59:23.000]  Most people have no idea.
[1:59:23.000 --> 1:59:24.000]  They're not after money.
[1:59:24.000 --> 1:59:25.000]  They have all the money they need.
[1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:26.000]  They're after power.
[1:59:26.000 --> 1:59:27.360]  That's their after-easy.

[2:20:48.360 --> 2:20:52.360]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[2:20:52.360 --> 2:20:58.360]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[2:20:58.360 --> 2:21:04.360]  It makes me wonder if the U.S. citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
[2:21:04.360 --> 2:21:10.360]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue ruling 6045 of 1984,
[2:21:10.360 --> 2:21:14.360]  and the Trading with the Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's executive order of 1933,
[2:21:14.360 --> 2:21:18.360]  some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[2:21:18.360 --> 2:21:23.360]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[2:21:23.360 --> 2:21:30.360]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[2:22:19.360 --> 2:22:23.360]  Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[2:22:39.360 --> 2:22:42.360]  We're in a no-holds-far information war.
[2:22:42.360 --> 2:22:48.360]  Truth is our weapon, and prisonplanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[2:22:48.360 --> 2:22:52.360]  Hello, I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 15 books on health and natural healing.
[2:22:52.360 --> 2:22:56.360]  Vaccines included, medicines kill more people every year than any illness.
[2:22:56.360 --> 2:23:00.360]  The cost of drug side effects in America is more than $200 billion annually,
[2:23:00.360 --> 2:23:03.360]  with the worst toll taken by antibiotics.
[2:23:03.360 --> 2:23:06.360]  But there is a cure for this medical madness that has remained secret.
[2:23:06.360 --> 2:23:10.360]  Oxysilver, developed by NASA scientists to keep astronauts healthy,
[2:23:10.360 --> 2:23:15.360]  is an evolutionary new dietary supplement making deadly vaccinations and antibiotics obsolete.
[2:23:15.360 --> 2:23:20.360]  Taking one to two teaspoons daily boosts natural immunity without drug toxicity.
[2:23:20.360 --> 2:23:23.360]  Oxysilver combines oxygen and silver in a new way.
[2:23:23.360 --> 2:23:28.360]  The oxygen becomes a supercharged germ killer freeing your immune system to fight colds,
[2:23:28.360 --> 2:23:30.360]  flus, cancers and more.
[2:23:30.360 --> 2:23:36.360]  This disease defenses naturally, painlessly, powerfully, safely and inexpensively with oxysilver.
[2:23:36.360 --> 2:23:42.360]  Order your supply now by calling toll-free 1-877-817-9829.
[2:23:42.360 --> 2:23:47.360]  That's 1-877-817-9829. Do it now.
[2:23:47.360 --> 2:24:05.360]  Okay, let's go right back to the head of a very prestigious medical organization,
[2:24:05.360 --> 2:24:08.360]  National Association of Medical Examiners.
[2:24:08.360 --> 2:24:11.360]  And that's Jeffrey Jensen.
[2:24:11.360 --> 2:24:13.360]  We've got five minutes left, sir. Just run the gamut,
[2:24:13.360 --> 2:24:20.360]  because I don't think some listeners may not realize just how incredible and amazing what's happening really is.
[2:24:20.360 --> 2:24:28.360]  Well, the involvement, the increasing involvement of tasers in related to sudden and unexpected deaths
[2:24:28.360 --> 2:24:35.360]  and the individuals are being taken under custody by law enforcement is becoming very alarming.
[2:24:35.360 --> 2:24:48.360]  And there have been studies in Canada and California that have suggested that these products are not as safe as we once thought,
[2:24:48.360 --> 2:24:57.360]  and they're calling for independent research on these to determine how safe they are before we release them to law enforcement.
[2:24:57.360 --> 2:25:05.360]  Our organization is especially concerned about the judge's court activity,
[2:25:05.360 --> 2:25:12.360]  in which he ordered the medical examiner to remove any mention of the taser use within the autopsy protocol,
[2:25:12.360 --> 2:25:17.360]  which we feel is an infringement upon our constitutional right of freedom of speech
[2:25:17.360 --> 2:25:22.360]  and our professional duties to determine the cause and manner of death.
[2:25:22.360 --> 2:25:27.360]  We are, as an organization, considering appealing this decision,
[2:25:27.360 --> 2:25:34.360]  and we're waiting for the prosecutor in the area to make a decision in that case before we would proceed.
[2:25:34.360 --> 2:25:41.360]  Well, look, it's one county, three deaths from taser, just with this case, and the company's being so aggressive.
[2:25:41.360 --> 2:25:46.360]  I don't see how this could stand. I mean, this is just crazy.
[2:25:46.360 --> 2:25:52.360]  And now police in Canada are using it. They catch you on the train without paying. They say it's a form of punishment.
[2:25:52.360 --> 2:25:58.360]  Or if you don't give a urine test in jail, they taser you. I mean, this is like cattle prods.
[2:25:58.360 --> 2:26:07.360]  Well, as I mentioned, our organization is concerned that they're being used indiscriminately and by individuals that aren't trained to use them.
[2:26:07.360 --> 2:26:22.360]  You know, we are very willing to assist in the research into these products and to alert law enforcement about the use and the misuse of these.
[2:26:22.360 --> 2:26:29.360]  But we really feel that we have a right to make an objective determination to cause a manner of death.
[2:26:29.360 --> 2:26:41.360]  We also understand that there may be differences of opinion, and we're willing to take those into effect and whether those carry the day in the court.
[2:26:41.360 --> 2:26:49.360]  That's not our objection. Our objection is to be ordered to remove all mention of the device.
[2:26:49.360 --> 2:26:56.360]  Well, I've heard of police chiefs and mayors getting indicted for ordering medical examiners to change reports.
[2:26:56.360 --> 2:27:12.360]  Well, we are legal and have our own authority, and when that authority is invaded by individuals and other agencies, it disrupts the balance of power.
[2:27:12.360 --> 2:27:28.360]  Me thinks they protest too much. Taser is acting very aggressive, very suspiciously. You have in the over 500 now in the western world known deaths right after you get tased, and it seems like they're trying to deny reality.
[2:27:28.360 --> 2:27:31.360]  And I don't see this as a fight they're going to win.
[2:27:31.360 --> 2:27:48.360]  Well, as I mentioned, this research comes out and we have more and more experience with these. Hopefully the Taser company will come alongside and continue the research on these products.
[2:27:48.360 --> 2:28:02.360]  Well, for those that don't know, headline, Taser went in court, puts chill on doctors. That's crazy. Doctors condemn threatening Taser ruling. Physicians speak out on bullying tactics of Taser International over its less than lethal weapons.
[2:28:02.360 --> 2:28:14.360]  And I think it goes to police threat continuum. I mean, you know, they shouldn't use this because somebody talks back to them. This is like right before they've got to use their gun with somebody, I guess, that's swinging at them.
[2:28:14.360 --> 2:28:17.360]  I mean, what are they really supposed to use these?
[2:28:17.360 --> 2:28:43.360]  These are an advanced method of taking an individual into custody. And as you mentioned, it should be used. I'm not a law enforcement expert, but it should be used only when other non-dangerous methods have gone over.
[2:28:43.360 --> 2:28:56.360]  Have you seen the footage of people in the drunk tank and they're telling them walk on the line, do their hands do that? You don't have to under the Fifth Amendment. And the guys being polite and the cops choking him and then he tasers him as for punishment for not doing it?
[2:28:56.360 --> 2:28:59.360]  No, I haven't seen those.
[2:28:59.360 --> 2:29:04.360]  Well, it's just incredible. How long until we get some word on whether you guys are going to appeal this?
[2:29:04.360 --> 2:29:09.360]  We should know within the next 30 days where this court case is going.
[2:29:09.360 --> 2:29:20.360]  Okay, thename.org, T-H-E, name.org, National Association of Medical Examiners, and we've had their director, their head guy, on Jeffrey Jensen.
[2:29:20.360 --> 2:29:27.360]  Sir, thank you so much for coming on with us and please pop back in as things develop as we follow this.
[2:29:27.360 --> 2:29:28.360]  You're welcome. Thank you.
[2:29:28.360 --> 2:29:30.360]  Thank you so much, doctor.
[2:29:30.360 --> 2:29:38.360]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, there goes Dr. Jensen. We'll be right back with Kevin Booth's Taser story.
[2:29:38.360 --> 2:29:42.360]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[2:29:42.360 --> 2:29:46.360]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:29:49.360 --> 2:29:55.360]  Imagine a firefly, simple and innocent. The ability to light the night sky.

[2:30:36.360 --> 2:30:47.360]  Hi, I'm Isabella, founder of Soleil Wellness. Visit us or call 866-497-0274.
[2:30:48.360 --> 2:30:52.360]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[2:30:52.360 --> 2:30:57.360]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:30:57.360 --> 2:31:03.360]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group. Could their objective be world domination?
[2:31:03.360 --> 2:31:09.360]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[2:31:09.360 --> 2:31:14.360]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:31:16.360 --> 2:31:22.360]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[2:31:22.360 --> 2:31:26.360]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[2:31:26.360 --> 2:31:29.360]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[2:31:29.360 --> 2:31:32.360]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power.
[2:31:32.360 --> 2:31:34.360]  Yes, they're after music.
[2:31:48.360 --> 2:31:51.360]  Can a magnet relieve pain? Can a magnet kill bacteria?
[2:31:51.360 --> 2:31:53.360]  Can a magnet address your health concerns?
[2:31:53.360 --> 2:31:55.360]  Lion Legacy has the answer.
[2:31:55.360 --> 2:31:59.360]  Lion Legacy has been around for 17 years and has coined the phrase,
[2:31:59.360 --> 2:32:03.360]  properly designed therapeutic magnets. Lion Legacy offers therapeutic magnets
[2:32:03.360 --> 2:32:06.360]  that are used by people all around the world with great success.
[2:32:06.360 --> 2:32:10.360]  These are not everyday magnets that are designed to hold a report card on the refrigerator.
[2:32:10.360 --> 2:32:13.360]  No, these magnets are nothing like you've ever seen.
[2:32:13.360 --> 2:32:16.360]  What makes them different? What makes them unique?
[2:32:16.360 --> 2:32:20.360]  Well, the poles are separated to deliver the healing energy of the North Pole
[2:32:20.360 --> 2:32:23.360]  and are large enough to deliver an effective force field.
[2:32:23.360 --> 2:32:26.360]  They're so durable that if you happen to drop them, they won't lose their strength.
[2:32:26.360 --> 2:32:29.360]  There is nothing more natural and safe than magnetic therapy.
[2:32:29.360 --> 2:32:34.360]  Lion Legacy has developed a line of supplements that improve the effectiveness of the magnets even more.
[2:32:34.360 --> 2:32:40.360]  For more information, visit lionlegacy.com or call 800-778-5731.
[2:32:40.360 --> 2:33:01.360]  That's 800-778-5731 or go to lyonlegacy.com today.
[2:33:01.360 --> 2:33:19.360]  We're going to play the FlowBots video at the end of this hour starting the fourth hour.
[2:33:19.360 --> 2:33:24.360]  President Planet.tv viewers will be able to see it over the live video feed.
[2:33:24.360 --> 2:33:29.360]  We do it every day in the fourth hour, but many times we end up doing three or four hours of the show.
[2:33:29.360 --> 2:33:35.360]  Some days we're about to go back to Kevin Booth, the maker of American drug war to talk more about that film.
[2:33:35.360 --> 2:33:40.360]  And yes, take your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[2:33:40.360 --> 2:33:45.360]  We're going to have Tommy Chung and Cheech on for at least an hour coming up in the next month or so.
[2:33:45.360 --> 2:33:49.360]  We'll open the phones up then as well. 1-800-2599-231.
[2:33:49.360 --> 2:33:53.360]  I mean, how transparent does this drug war have to get? How fraudulent? How obvious?
[2:33:53.360 --> 2:33:56.360]  We'll go to Kevin Booth in one moment.
[2:33:56.360 --> 2:33:59.360]  Before I do that, don't forget we're trying to capitalize around here.
[2:33:59.360 --> 2:34:04.360]  We're trying to build up our capital so I can get a bigger office, bigger studio, better cameras, better computers,
[2:34:04.360 --> 2:34:11.360]  and launch a network TV show and then a network itself.
[2:34:11.360 --> 2:34:15.360]  And we're looking into all of it. It's doable. We know we can do it. It just takes the capital.
[2:34:15.360 --> 2:34:23.360]  And I think, unless the economy totally implodes the next year, if we get this launched the next six months, which is a big job,
[2:34:23.360 --> 2:34:28.360]  we could have a network up in the next year. We've got a show launched and then a network.
[2:34:28.360 --> 2:34:33.360]  But that's why people heard us talk about that and other issues and launched the InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[2:34:33.360 --> 2:34:37.360]  Now, I'm not running this, but later today, there'll be a PayPal up there with a link.
[2:34:37.360 --> 2:34:41.360]  It'll be next Saturday. Now, this Saturday, next Saturday, it will be the InfoWars MoneyBomb.
[2:34:41.360 --> 2:34:47.360]  $50,000 plus pledged right now. Frankly, what we can do with a million dollars is unbelievable.
[2:34:47.360 --> 2:34:52.360]  It'll probably be more like $100,000, I guess, will come in. And that sounds like a lot. It's not in TV.
[2:34:52.360 --> 2:34:58.360]  We don't have the New World Order funding us. We need your help. Go subscribe to PrismPlanet.tv to help with what we're doing.

[2:36:01.360 --> 2:36:07.360]  But their green food is amazing. They've been supporting the Patriot radio movement for years.

[2:37:02.360 --> 2:37:07.360]  They don't have magical pyramid beams that, you know, destroy the chemtrails and other fruit cake-ness.
[2:37:07.360 --> 2:37:14.360]  I know they just go, hey, we got well-known concentrated aloe vera that flushes your guts out with a bunch of other herbs that are well-known and documented for centuries.

[2:37:28.360 --> 2:37:30.360]  Sometimes they're not number one, so they're going to be technical.
[2:37:30.360 --> 2:37:38.360]  They're in the top two or three prostate formulas out there, well-known herbs that shrink the prostate and make it healthier.
[2:37:38.360 --> 2:37:43.360]  1-800-569-4056 or newvitality.com.
[2:37:43.360 --> 2:37:48.360]  That said, that's how we operate and fund ourselves here and I only bring you products I believe in.
[2:37:48.360 --> 2:37:55.360]  That's the products you hear me endorsing, not necessarily ones you hear being advertised, not saying the other stuff isn't bad or isn't good.
[2:37:55.360 --> 2:37:57.360]  I'm just saying I'm not vouching for it.
[2:37:57.360 --> 2:38:00.360]  I'll be clear about that because I just cringe sometimes.
[2:38:00.360 --> 2:38:06.360]  I just got to say that morally, but the stuff I push, I believe in, ladies and gentlemen, I use it.
[2:38:06.360 --> 2:38:14.360]  But I was fighting over the alloys a few days ago with Rob. He thought it would be for him. I said, get your own free bottle. Mine!
[2:38:14.360 --> 2:38:16.360]  It actually happened.
[2:38:16.360 --> 2:38:20.360]  Anyways, I'm just, oh, it's an insane life.
[2:38:20.360 --> 2:38:24.360]  By the way, good old Rob Jacobson. I met him through Kevin Booth.
[2:38:24.360 --> 2:38:26.360]  He worked a little bit on American drug war at the first.
[2:38:26.360 --> 2:38:29.360]  Kevin, tell your Taser story.
[2:38:29.360 --> 2:38:40.360]  I got to go out on a ride along with the LAPD and we went to the most definitely most infamous neighborhood in Los Angeles through the Skid Row area,
[2:38:40.360 --> 2:38:44.360]  which is now by far more dangerous than even South Central is.
[2:38:44.360 --> 2:38:47.360]  That's where the term Skid Row comes from.
[2:38:47.360 --> 2:38:59.360]  Yeah, I mean, it's a place where they purposely kind of dump all the homeless people. Now their stories now are hospitals are dumping old patients that can't pay their bills.
[2:38:59.360 --> 2:39:04.360]  By the way, that's been confirmed in the personal bag and they'll punch them in the face.
[2:39:04.360 --> 2:39:12.360]  Yeah, they've got it on camera, hospitals just dumping old women with no shoes on and bad like your old grandmother in a bathrobe.
[2:39:12.360 --> 2:39:16.360]  It's like we're in India or Mexico or Guatemala. This country is gone.
[2:39:16.360 --> 2:39:21.360]  It's unbelievable. So it was right. Chinatown is right in the border there, very close.
[2:39:21.360 --> 2:39:27.360]  And they got a call and there was a black guy on PCP had taken off all of his clothes.
[2:39:27.360 --> 2:39:29.360]  He had run into this Chinese restaurant.
[2:39:29.360 --> 2:39:31.360]  Don't say what he's doing. It's in the film.
[2:39:31.360 --> 2:39:33.360]  And yeah, he just went crazy.
[2:39:33.360 --> 2:39:40.360]  And basically what was interesting that I've never spoke about before was, you know, after they shot him with the tasers, he had all these darts in his back.
[2:39:40.360 --> 2:39:48.360]  And it was the way that the policemen and even the EMS guys were handling it that was just has always stuck in my mind.
[2:39:48.360 --> 2:39:57.360]  It was almost like a medical procedure. The way they had their gloves on and they were sitting there like constantly making sure that the darts were all like secure and in place.
[2:39:57.360 --> 2:40:02.360]  And they treated him with such gentle care while they tasered him.
[2:40:02.360 --> 2:40:07.360]  Well, that's part of the sick mental illness. The death camps in Germany made it a procedure.
[2:40:07.360 --> 2:40:09.360]  How many taser darts do you have in his back?
[2:40:09.360 --> 2:40:11.360]  About seven.
[2:40:11.360 --> 2:40:14.360]  Now, that's why people are dying. It's the repeated tasering the study show.
[2:40:14.360 --> 2:40:17.360]  Did they need to taser him seven times?
[2:40:17.360 --> 2:40:21.360]  No, I mean, he was already, you know, subdued at that point. He was sitting there still.
[2:40:21.360 --> 2:40:26.360]  Well, yeah, he's peaceful. I mean, he was peacefully in the restaurant sticking ice cubes somewhere. That's all we're going to say.
[2:40:26.360 --> 2:40:27.360]  Yeah.
[2:40:27.360 --> 2:40:31.360]  And sorry, this film's so graphic. We're not into this. It's what's really going on.
[2:40:31.360 --> 2:40:38.360]  Right. I mean, I had to just show this thing and I didn't even show it as a way to really, I'm not trying to make the police look bad by this.
[2:40:38.360 --> 2:40:42.360]  This was just them. I mean, at least they didn't kill the guy, right?
[2:40:42.360 --> 2:40:45.360]  But then it's what I had to go through. I mean, after this.
[2:40:45.360 --> 2:40:49.360]  But why seven tasers? They just all had to get in on it because they surrounded him?
[2:40:49.360 --> 2:40:52.360]  Well, there were so many darts. I'm not sure how many guns were shot at him.
[2:40:52.360 --> 2:41:03.360]  But it was just the way that they kept it going and the way they carefully placed them on a gurney and carried them into an ambulance while the guy kept all the taser darts in his back.
[2:41:03.360 --> 2:41:09.360]  So the guy was like long. He was completely restrained, you know, head to toe restrained with a hood over his head, everything.
[2:41:09.360 --> 2:41:17.360]  And yet they left all the darts in his back. They carefully placed them on the gurney and the guy like holding the gun that was, you know, popping the juice on.
[2:41:17.360 --> 2:41:19.360]  I'm like, you know, escorted them into the ambulance.
[2:41:19.360 --> 2:41:21.360]  How many times did they juicing?
[2:41:21.360 --> 2:41:23.360]  I'm not sure. I'm not sure.
[2:41:23.360 --> 2:41:26.360]  I mean, did you hear the ticking repeatedly?
[2:41:26.360 --> 2:41:31.360]  No, not that many times. They done most of it before I got there with the camera.
[2:41:31.360 --> 2:41:33.360]  You know, I was like seeing the aftermath.
[2:41:33.360 --> 2:41:37.360]  It was, you know, I'm not sure how much ticking there is when the wires are in.
[2:41:37.360 --> 2:41:41.360]  I think the ticking is when there's like a gap.
[2:41:41.360 --> 2:41:45.360]  And it is like different types of tasers, how they work differently.
[2:41:45.360 --> 2:41:59.360]  But what I wanted to talk about was just about how the LAPD tried to censor me from being able to use the footage in the film and how they basically, you know, I had to sign this contract in order to go on the ride along.
[2:41:59.360 --> 2:42:04.360]  And then they told me that if, you know, after watching the footage that I would have to remove the footage.
[2:42:04.360 --> 2:42:14.360]  And they said, well, you know, they had this woman who was like this Emmy award winning news anchor woman who had been now the head of public relations for LAPD called me up.
[2:42:14.360 --> 2:42:18.360]  And she's like, kid, and I can understand why you want to have that footage in your film.
[2:42:18.360 --> 2:42:20.360]  It's powerful. It's powerful.
[2:42:20.360 --> 2:42:28.360]  I understand why you want it, but we just can't allow you to do that because it gives away our police procedures.
[2:42:28.360 --> 2:42:30.360]  And that was their reasoning.
[2:42:30.360 --> 2:42:33.360]  And then she told me that if I left it in the film that I would be sorry.
[2:42:33.360 --> 2:42:35.360]  And that's how she left it with me.
[2:42:35.360 --> 2:42:37.360]  And now you've been getting helicopter visits.
[2:42:37.360 --> 2:42:38.360]  Tell folks about it.
[2:42:38.360 --> 2:42:40.360]  Right after I got producer tax.
[2:42:40.360 --> 2:42:44.360]  I got a thing in the mail saying, you owe three years of back producer tax.
[2:42:44.360 --> 2:42:50.360]  And it was this producer tax I called everybody I know that's lived in Los Angeles or whole lives.
[2:42:50.360 --> 2:42:52.360]  Nobody's ever heard of a thing called producer tax.
[2:42:52.360 --> 2:42:54.360]  And yet now I got it.
[2:42:54.360 --> 2:42:59.360]  And they basically said, if you don't pay this producer tax, we could take your home away.
[2:42:59.360 --> 2:43:02.360]  You need to incorporate back in Texas or Alaska.
[2:43:02.360 --> 2:43:04.360]  I'm incorporated in Nevada.
[2:43:04.360 --> 2:43:06.360]  They can't do that.
[2:43:06.360 --> 2:43:09.360]  And you're not under a union. That's a load of bull.
[2:43:09.360 --> 2:43:11.360]  It's crazy.
[2:43:11.360 --> 2:43:13.360]  My lawyer looked into it.
[2:43:13.360 --> 2:43:15.360]  It came from the mayor's office.
[2:43:15.360 --> 2:43:17.360]  There's just one of many things.
[2:43:17.360 --> 2:43:19.360]  And then I suddenly start getting jury duty.
[2:43:19.360 --> 2:43:27.360]  And it's just like all of a sudden I'm like the target of all these little things I have to constantly tell me about the guys on the white pole every other day in the helicopter.
[2:43:27.360 --> 2:43:33.360]  Oh, I mean, we, you know, here in the Hollywood Hills, I mean, there's, there's always helicopters buzzing around.
[2:43:33.360 --> 2:43:38.360]  But I've constantly having helicopters that will just, you know, the guy, you know, I'm on the very top of a mountain.
[2:43:38.360 --> 2:43:40.360]  And the guy will just be like practically face to face with me.
[2:43:40.360 --> 2:43:41.360]  I've got pictures.
[2:43:41.360 --> 2:43:42.360]  I could email you a picture.
[2:43:42.360 --> 2:43:43.360]  You got to put those on the web.
[2:43:43.360 --> 2:43:44.360]  Yeah.
[2:43:44.360 --> 2:43:45.360]  They just sit there and buzz.
[2:43:45.360 --> 2:43:52.360]  And hey, get this, they were going to buy like these 13 or 12 million, I forget, dollar German helicopters.
[2:43:52.360 --> 2:43:56.360]  And I noticed that they were over, over paying for them.
[2:43:56.360 --> 2:43:59.360]  And I went down and complained and I said, stop saying it's star flight.
[2:43:59.360 --> 2:44:03.360]  You're mainly going to use this to harass people and the pilots all got real mad.
[2:44:03.360 --> 2:44:05.360]  And guess what they did a few days later, this was admitted.
[2:44:05.360 --> 2:44:11.360]  They flew over my parents house who live on three acres in the middle of town and the guy hung out and flipped my mother off.
[2:44:11.360 --> 2:44:14.360]  I mean, at tree top level.
[2:44:14.360 --> 2:44:15.360]  Yeah.
[2:44:15.360 --> 2:44:18.360]  I mean, yeah, these people are amazing.
[2:44:18.360 --> 2:44:19.360]  Yeah.
[2:44:19.360 --> 2:44:21.360]  I just wonder like how much fuel they actually waste.
[2:44:21.360 --> 2:44:23.360]  So are they like buzz around from times up there?
[2:44:23.360 --> 2:44:24.360]  It's incredible.
[2:44:24.360 --> 2:44:27.360]  I mean, you, you got to just go, what are you guys doing?
[2:44:27.360 --> 2:44:29.360]  I mean, that's like the last address.
[2:44:29.360 --> 2:44:32.360]  I guess they don't know where my address was at the time because I had, you know, I had lit.
[2:44:32.360 --> 2:44:34.360]  I mean, I was like 23 when that happened.
[2:44:34.360 --> 2:44:37.360]  And then I'd been, I moved out of home for like five, six years then.
[2:44:37.360 --> 2:44:43.360]  But no, I mean, it was right there and she walks out and he kept going for minutes and he was like, right over the trees.
[2:44:43.360 --> 2:44:44.360]  I mean, dangerous.
[2:44:44.360 --> 2:44:49.360]  And then she comes out and she's looking at the guy hangs out the side and just flips her off.
[2:44:49.360 --> 2:44:50.360]  Yeah.
[2:44:50.360 --> 2:44:51.360]  I mean, you got to love America.
[2:44:51.360 --> 2:44:52.360]  Don't you Kevin?
[2:44:52.360 --> 2:44:53.360]  That's classic.
[2:44:53.360 --> 2:44:54.360]  That's classic.
[2:44:54.360 --> 2:44:59.360]  You know, to back to Tommy, you know, a little bit to wrap up on the Tommy Chong thing.
[2:44:59.360 --> 2:45:07.360]  And you know, for any of your listeners out there that think of him as like an old stoner hippie or something like that or a bad influence.
[2:45:07.360 --> 2:45:14.360]  Tommy has become an American icon and that's why it was so important for them to take him down.
[2:45:14.360 --> 2:45:18.360]  But I, you know, why the drug war is so important and it's hard.
[2:45:18.360 --> 2:45:29.360]  You know, I try to go to college campuses and a lot of the young kids out there, they don't really understand it because they equate it with like, well, the only reason anybody would want to stop the drug wars because they want to do drugs.
[2:45:29.360 --> 2:45:38.360]  And it's, you know, when Richard Nixon put marijuana in schedule one back in 71, that was definitely a defining, a defining moment.
[2:45:38.360 --> 2:45:44.360]  And anybody out there, it doesn't matter whether you smoke pot or not, whether you smoke cigarettes or not, whatever.
[2:45:44.360 --> 2:45:57.360]  When our government tells you that you can go to prison and will go to prison for growing a plant or you can go to prison because you want to smoke green herbs instead of brown tobacco, then you're not living in a free country.
[2:45:57.360 --> 2:46:02.360]  Well, now if you have any of the chemicals used in making amphetamines, they all put you in jail.
[2:46:02.360 --> 2:46:05.360]  Now the chemicals you go to prison for.
[2:46:05.360 --> 2:46:07.360]  And in this latest story we've been watching too.
[2:46:07.360 --> 2:46:10.360]  I just made a little video clip called Operation Sudden Fall.
[2:46:10.360 --> 2:46:13.360]  I think you had a link to it on Info Wars.
[2:46:13.360 --> 2:46:17.360]  You can also go to YouTube and just type in Operation Sudden Fall.
[2:46:17.360 --> 2:46:31.360]  They just had this arrest, and so because of the death of one or two kids, obviously, you know, a 19-year-old white girl from overdose of cocaine on the San Diego University campus, they arrested over 75 students.
[2:46:31.360 --> 2:46:35.360]  And as a result, almost 100 students now aren't going to be graduating.
[2:46:35.360 --> 2:46:36.360]  And of course, who was dealing the drugs?
[2:46:36.360 --> 2:46:38.360]  It was all the guys going to school to be cops.
[2:46:38.360 --> 2:46:39.360]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:46:39.360 --> 2:46:41.360]  They were all, well, that's good officers.
[2:46:41.360 --> 2:46:43.360]  I don't know why they did that.
[2:46:43.360 --> 2:46:52.360]  Yeah, exactly, Homeland Security guys, frat boys and all that, but the point is, is that once again, what they do is they bleed it all together.
[2:46:52.360 --> 2:46:59.360]  So, you know, it's one thing if you want to arrest the top dog and he was sitting on four pounds of cocaine and all that.
[2:46:59.360 --> 2:47:06.360]  I understand that, but what they did was they arrested anybody that they could give to sell even a joint to an undercover officer.
[2:47:06.360 --> 2:47:08.360]  They went in there and they planted.
[2:47:08.360 --> 2:47:13.360]  Yeah, most of your arrests were for marijuana and not cocaine and heroin that the government shipping in.
[2:47:13.360 --> 2:47:14.360]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:47:14.360 --> 2:47:21.360]  But when you watch the news stories about it, they skew all the lines and all of a sudden they draw these charts like the classic, like, uh,
[2:47:21.360 --> 2:47:29.360]  Costa Nostra, like those, you know, like the big Godfather charts where it's like, here's the top guys and, you know, like that, the big flow chart of all the faces.
[2:47:29.360 --> 2:47:31.360]  And it's all these goofy college students.
[2:47:31.360 --> 2:47:36.360]  And you're realizing like some of these faces of people, like you're, you know, as a kid that had a quarter ounce of pot.
[2:47:36.360 --> 2:47:39.360]  And I also wanted to tell one other story really quick.
[2:47:39.360 --> 2:47:49.360]  And that is, uh, we know a young boy who's a friend of the family who, um, he had to go to a 60 day court ordered, uh, drug rehab there in, uh, Texas.
[2:47:49.360 --> 2:47:56.360]  And while he was in the, uh, drug rehab, and by the way, he had to go there because they caught him with a bowl of marijuana.
[2:47:56.360 --> 2:48:05.360]  Uh, they get cable TV in there and they were told that if they watched the American drug war or the show Breaking Bad that they would be sent to lock up.
[2:48:05.360 --> 2:48:07.360]  Amazing.
[2:48:07.360 --> 2:48:13.360]  So he was sent to jail for a bowl, a tiny, uh, basically the amount that's in a cigarette.
[2:48:13.360 --> 2:48:14.360]  Right.
[2:48:14.360 --> 2:48:15.360]  Exactly.
[2:48:15.360 --> 2:48:16.360]  Right.
[2:48:16.360 --> 2:48:18.360]  He had had a DWI charge in all fairness.
[2:48:18.360 --> 2:48:19.360]  And so he was under probation.
[2:48:19.360 --> 2:48:20.360]  Yeah.
[2:48:20.360 --> 2:48:22.360]  But the point is, is that we have more people in prison.
[2:48:22.360 --> 2:48:23.360]  What's a greater danger?
[2:48:23.360 --> 2:48:32.360]  Somebody's smoking marijuana or even a few drunk drivers when they're not even allowed to arrest the illegal aliens that's admitted or millions of goons running around, shaking us down.
[2:48:32.360 --> 2:48:34.360]  I mean, you know, that's the greater danger.
[2:48:34.360 --> 2:48:40.360]  Well, no, yeah, but now they've taken a young boy who has never been exposed to hard criminals or hard drug use.
[2:48:40.360 --> 2:48:46.360]  And now he spent 60 days, uh, side by side with hardcore heroin users, the PCP users.
[2:48:46.360 --> 2:48:47.360]  And those are new friends.
[2:48:47.360 --> 2:48:49.360]  Those are contacts he's going to make.
[2:48:49.360 --> 2:48:51.360]  And they're called colleges of prison.
[2:48:51.360 --> 2:48:52.360]  And everybody knows this.
[2:48:52.360 --> 2:48:54.360]  And don't give it to me cops.
[2:48:54.360 --> 2:48:58.360]  You don't, the drugs aren't brought in by your bosses and that, oh, I'm making stuff up.
[2:48:58.360 --> 2:49:02.360]  We all know there's triple the heroin, double the cocaine there was 15 years ago.
[2:49:02.360 --> 2:49:07.360]  We all know we've gone from 300,000 in prison to 7 million in the system, 4 million behind bars.
[2:49:07.360 --> 2:49:11.360]  They're building even more prisons from 300,000 cops to 2 million cops.
[2:49:11.360 --> 2:49:13.360]  We all know it's a joke.
[2:49:13.360 --> 2:49:17.360]  We all know that by criminalizing it, it makes the drugs be very expensive.
[2:49:17.360 --> 2:49:19.360]  Now we have huge drug gangs taking over.
[2:49:19.360 --> 2:49:21.360]  Thanks a lot, dirtbag government.
[2:49:21.360 --> 2:49:28.360]  And thanks a lot, ignorant mainline conservatives who went along with Nixon, whose whole administration was run by narcotics traffickers.
[2:49:28.360 --> 2:49:30.360]  They were bringing in drugs.
[2:49:30.360 --> 2:49:32.360]  They wanted higher prices.
[2:49:32.360 --> 2:49:33.360]  Yeah.
[2:49:33.360 --> 2:49:40.360]  Drug war is reportedly now just, just in the upfront tax cost is now cost the taxpayers over $1 trillion.
[2:49:40.360 --> 2:49:44.360]  That's, that's just the reported like to fund their, their normal budget.
[2:49:44.360 --> 2:49:45.360]  That's not all.
[2:49:45.360 --> 2:49:46.360]  And here's the deal.
[2:49:46.360 --> 2:49:47.360]  Here's the deal.
[2:49:47.360 --> 2:49:50.360]  They got 3 trillion with the phony war so far over a trillion with this.
[2:49:50.360 --> 2:49:55.360]  They militarized their business and now they're coming for speeding, not using a turn signal.
[2:49:55.360 --> 2:49:57.360]  You're going to get hard prison time now.
[2:49:57.360 --> 2:50:01.360]  Have you heard about Florida 10 years in jail for speeding?
[2:50:01.360 --> 2:50:03.360]  No, I haven't heard that one.
[2:50:03.360 --> 2:50:04.360]  Oh yeah.
[2:50:04.360 --> 2:50:05.360]  In England, I got stories here.
[2:50:05.360 --> 2:50:07.360]  You take your trash out, they arrest you.
[2:50:07.360 --> 2:50:11.360]  You take your trash out before midnight, before the day they arrest you.
[2:50:11.360 --> 2:50:12.360]  You drop a banana peel.
[2:50:12.360 --> 2:50:14.360]  It's now happening here.
[2:50:14.360 --> 2:50:18.360]  Cops are being arrested because fellow cops spy on them and see them smoke a cigar on their bass boat.
[2:50:18.360 --> 2:50:19.360]  It's over.
[2:50:19.360 --> 2:50:20.360]  They're fired.
[2:50:20.360 --> 2:50:21.360]  I mean, just tattletales everywhere.
[2:50:21.360 --> 2:50:23.360]  Did you see the New York Times, Kevin?
[2:50:23.360 --> 2:50:29.360]  Where 44% up in tipster lines, grandmothers turning in grandchildren?
[2:50:29.360 --> 2:50:30.360]  No, I didn't see that.
[2:50:30.360 --> 2:50:33.360]  I mean, that is land of the coward, home of the slaves.
[2:50:33.360 --> 2:50:35.360]  I mean, that is land of scum and filth.
[2:50:35.360 --> 2:50:37.360]  Let's admit what we are, folks.
[2:50:37.360 --> 2:50:45.360]  We are bloated, disgusting, evil, retarded, petulant, greedy, backstabbing rats.
[2:50:45.360 --> 2:50:48.360]  Maybe we can turn it around, but who knows?
[2:50:48.360 --> 2:50:53.360]  It is a big idea, a New World Order.
[2:50:53.360 --> 2:50:58.360]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:50:58.360 --> 2:51:00.360]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[2:51:00.360 --> 2:51:03.360]  Could their objective be world domination?
[2:51:03.360 --> 2:51:06.360]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[2:51:06.360 --> 2:51:17.360]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:51:17.360 --> 2:51:22.360]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[2:51:22.360 --> 2:51:26.360]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[2:51:26.360 --> 2:51:29.360]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[2:51:29.360 --> 2:51:30.360]  Most people have no idea.
[2:51:30.360 --> 2:51:31.360]  They're not after money.
[2:51:31.360 --> 2:51:32.360]  They have all the money they need.
[2:51:32.360 --> 2:51:33.360]  They're after power.
[2:51:33.360 --> 2:51:34.360]  That's their after-easy.

[2:54:00.360 --> 2:54:03.360]  Folks, I don't care how you dress, how you look.
[2:54:03.360 --> 2:54:06.360]  That doesn't mean anything to me.
[2:54:06.360 --> 2:54:11.360]  But the police have been trained that long hair is an enemy uniform.
[2:54:11.360 --> 2:54:17.360]  They have been trained that hippie style clothes, trendy, any of it.
[2:54:17.360 --> 2:54:28.360]  And my whole deal is, I mean, do you want a trained paramilitary force that needs to throw you into a meat grinder to feed the drug cartels that own the prisons?
[2:54:28.360 --> 2:54:30.360]  Do you want them to alert on you?
[2:54:30.360 --> 2:54:34.360]  It's kind of like if a bull attacks somebody in red, why are you wearing red?
[2:54:34.360 --> 2:54:36.360]  You're like, because I'm allowed to wear what I want.
[2:54:36.360 --> 2:54:38.360]  I know, but you're in an enemy camp.
[2:54:38.360 --> 2:54:40.360]  We are occupied.
[2:54:40.360 --> 2:54:41.360]  MIT admits it.
[2:54:41.360 --> 2:54:45.360]  We are under a scientific pentagon slave grid.
[2:54:45.360 --> 2:54:47.360]  They're locking it down.
[2:54:47.360 --> 2:54:50.360]  They're building camps and they want to alert on you young people.
[2:54:50.360 --> 2:54:54.360]  You defeat them by never using their drugs.
[2:54:54.360 --> 2:54:56.360]  You defeat them by waking others up.
[2:54:56.360 --> 2:54:59.360]  You defeat them by exposing them.
[2:54:59.360 --> 2:55:03.360]  You defeat them by living better than them and not being degenerate scum.
[2:55:03.360 --> 2:55:07.360]  I mean, it's so sick, so dishonorable.
[2:55:07.360 --> 2:55:14.360]  Kevin, does it ever just blow you away mentally that reality is so crazy that the government ships the drugs in and then puts us in prison for using it?
[2:55:14.360 --> 2:55:17.360]  I mean, the diabolical criminal mind there.
[2:55:17.360 --> 2:55:38.360]  Well, I mean, what blows me away is what they're allowed to sell as prescription drugs compared to that, where the drugs that I can go out and get legal prescriptions for from a doctor are so much more powerful and so much more dangerous on so many different levels with side effects and just making you crazy.
[2:55:38.360 --> 2:55:42.360]  I mean, when I was younger experimenting with drugs, one time I took a diet pill.
[2:55:42.360 --> 2:55:48.360]  And I mean, I had a full on psychotic episode, nothing compared to any of the illegal drugs.
[2:55:48.360 --> 2:55:54.360]  I've had much more bizarre, horrifying experiences from legal prescription drugs.
[2:55:54.360 --> 2:55:58.360]  Oh, I've had girlfriends that were on Prozac and they were complete in lunatics.
[2:55:58.360 --> 2:56:03.360]  Yeah, no, and that's just at the center core of this whole drug war.
[2:56:03.360 --> 2:56:11.360]  And that is, it's really, you know, to me, it's like the pharmaceutical cartels and the oil cartels are really kind of like behind this whole...
[2:56:11.360 --> 2:56:12.360]  And they launder the drug money.
[2:56:12.360 --> 2:56:14.360]  They've been caught hundreds of times.
[2:56:14.360 --> 2:56:17.360]  A fellow reserve's been caught with hundreds of billions of drug money before.
[2:56:17.360 --> 2:56:18.360]  I mean, why not?
[2:56:18.360 --> 2:56:22.360]  Because they got to keep the drugs illegal to keep the price up.
[2:56:22.360 --> 2:56:24.360]  And then you put us in jail, you bastards.
[2:56:24.360 --> 2:56:27.360]  Maybe I'm going to build a car that runs off of cocaine.
[2:56:27.360 --> 2:56:29.360]  It'll be cheaper.
[2:56:29.360 --> 2:56:30.360]  Oh my God.
[2:56:30.360 --> 2:56:35.360]  Can you believe that they're talking about $200 a barrel or 10, $12, $14 gas?
[2:56:35.360 --> 2:56:36.360]  I know exactly.
[2:56:36.360 --> 2:56:37.360]  That's all.
[2:56:37.360 --> 2:56:39.360]  I'm going to build a car that'll run off cocaine.
[2:56:39.360 --> 2:56:40.360]  It'll be cheaper.
[2:56:40.360 --> 2:56:45.360]  You probably have Richard Grasso head of the New York Stock Exchange visit you.
[2:56:45.360 --> 2:56:48.360]  These people make me sick, man.
[2:56:48.360 --> 2:56:49.360]  It's incredible.
[2:56:49.360 --> 2:56:58.360]  I just, you know, I just want to make sure that everybody stays focused on the drug war with all these issues that are coming down right now.
[2:56:58.360 --> 2:57:01.360]  Election fraud and all of these things.
[2:57:01.360 --> 2:57:07.360]  It's important to keep your eyes on the drug war because the drug war is at the nucleus of this whole thing.
[2:57:07.360 --> 2:57:10.360]  I mean, it's been an incredible tool.
[2:57:10.360 --> 2:57:12.360]  Without the drug war, they would not be where they are today.
[2:57:12.360 --> 2:57:13.360]  Yeah.
[2:57:13.360 --> 2:57:16.360]  That was their cover to militarize the police, build their camps, build their prison complex.
[2:57:16.360 --> 2:57:18.360]  Now is the next move.
[2:57:18.360 --> 2:57:21.360]  You know, they've only eaten part of the, now they're going to fully digest the country.
[2:57:21.360 --> 2:57:22.360]  Right.
[2:57:22.360 --> 2:57:23.360]  I mean, drugs and terror.
[2:57:23.360 --> 2:57:30.360]  I mean, those are the two things that will never be defeated and that we're going to like go down trying to fight.
[2:57:30.360 --> 2:57:32.360]  Look at what a hoax it is, Kevin.
[2:57:32.360 --> 2:57:36.360]  Look at what a hoax it is that the war on, I mean, they're training local police how to quote,
[2:57:36.360 --> 2:57:40.360]  look to have a detect roadside bombs in Austin.
[2:57:40.360 --> 2:57:42.360]  I mean, this is insane.
[2:57:42.360 --> 2:57:43.360]  Yeah.
[2:57:43.360 --> 2:57:45.360]  When it hasn't even happened once, right?
[2:57:45.360 --> 2:57:46.360]  I mean, you know what I mean?
[2:57:46.360 --> 2:57:48.360]  Well, it's an excuse to go under military control.

[3:02:01.360 --> 3:02:03.360]  In such a small world.
[3:02:03.360 --> 3:02:05.360]  I'm all curled up with the book to read.

[3:04:49.360 --> 3:04:54.360]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government
[3:04:54.360 --> 3:04:57.360]  It's known as the Bilderberg
[3:04:57.360 --> 3:05:00.360]  Could their objective be world domination?
[3:05:00.360 --> 3:05:03.360]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew
[3:05:03.360 --> 3:05:06.360]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order

[3:05:48.360 --> 3:05:53.360]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[3:05:53.360 --> 3:05:58.360]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin

[3:06:50.360 --> 3:06:55.360]  But as you know most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet and lack of exercise
[3:06:55.360 --> 3:07:00.360]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health as well as prevention of disease
[3:07:00.360 --> 3:07:06.360]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity and loss of weight
[3:07:06.360 --> 3:07:09.360]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water
[3:07:09.360 --> 3:07:13.360]  But due to modern way of life most people are overly acidic
[3:07:13.360 --> 3:07:16.360]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment
[3:07:16.360 --> 3:07:21.360]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it
[3:07:21.360 --> 3:07:25.360]  Do your part, alkalize and supercharge your body now

[3:08:47.360 --> 3:08:52.360]  Human beings are amazing and I'm just so blessed to be alive and to be fighting back against this evil
[3:08:52.360 --> 3:08:55.360]  And if it sounds like I'm screaming and yelling at the government
[3:08:55.360 --> 3:08:58.360]  What's the mind trick to where we wouldn't be sick of it?
[3:08:58.360 --> 3:09:00.360]  They bring the majority of the drugs in
[3:09:00.360 --> 3:09:04.360]  They only raid at the source level, their competition, which is small
[3:09:04.360 --> 3:09:09.360]  They're enslaving us, they're taking over, there's no debating it, we're in deep trouble
[3:09:09.360 --> 3:09:15.360]  We have to take the moral authority back from them and say get off my back, get out of my life
[3:09:15.360 --> 3:09:19.360]  Leave my second amendment alone, let me protect myself
[3:09:19.360 --> 3:09:23.360]  We got loaded phones on both phone systems Kevin, I want to take a bunch of calls for the rest of the hour
[3:09:23.360 --> 3:09:27.360]  Whether you'll stay with us and play one more music video from Flowbot
[3:09:27.360 --> 3:09:31.360]  Coming up called War on Fear Mind, I wonder where they got that
[3:09:31.360 --> 3:09:37.360]  But just for five, ten minutes, anything you want to talk about Kevin concerning what you're saying about Al
[3:09:37.360 --> 3:09:41.360]  The drug war, the war on terror, it's the key boogeyman
[3:09:41.360 --> 3:09:46.360]  And we have to understand they are creating it, they are provocaturing it, they are behind it
[3:09:46.360 --> 3:09:51.360]  This is their business of making us think that we need them, Kevin
[3:09:51.360 --> 3:09:58.360]  You know, and back to the marijuana argument and the statistic that you told earlier about
[3:09:58.360 --> 3:10:02.360]  85% of all illegal drug users only smoke marijuana
[3:10:02.360 --> 3:10:06.360]  And so when you go and you can go to the DEA's website
[3:10:06.360 --> 3:10:14.360]  And it's almost like a shell game how they've slipped marijuana in with all these really dangerous weird substances
[3:10:14.360 --> 3:10:17.360]  I mean, go to the DEA website, look for yourself at the drug scheduling
[3:10:17.360 --> 3:10:22.360]  And you're going to see all these dangerous, huge long dangerous list of substances
[3:10:22.360 --> 3:10:25.360]  And then marijuana is just mixed in there like it's no different
[3:10:25.360 --> 3:10:31.360]  And you know, the drugs are, and other people will argue this by saying
[3:10:31.360 --> 3:10:38.360]  Oh well, we tried to legalize this one seed for the treatment of cancer a while back
[3:10:38.360 --> 3:10:45.360]  And it turned out that it had cyanide in it and they have all these bizarre and ridiculous arguments
[3:10:45.360 --> 3:10:50.360]  But the funny thing is is that what other substance on earth has there ever been
[3:10:50.360 --> 3:10:54.360]  Where you're going to see people have like these giant parades and rallies
[3:10:54.360 --> 3:10:58.360]  You know what I mean, you're never going to see a Prozac rally or a Prozac parade
[3:10:58.360 --> 3:11:02.360]  You're never going to see a crack parade or a crystal meth rally
[3:11:02.360 --> 3:11:10.360]  You know, marijuana is a freedom and a right that should be guaranteed to everybody
[3:11:10.360 --> 3:11:13.360]  And them taking that away is really at the nexus
[3:11:13.360 --> 3:11:18.360]  You know, it's a canary in the coal mine type of thing
[3:11:18.360 --> 3:11:22.360]  Just like Robert Steele in the film talks about that marijuana is right at the nexus
[3:11:22.360 --> 3:11:28.360]  Of good versus evil, of corporatism versus freedom and sovereignty
[3:11:28.360 --> 3:11:34.360]  And I just can't get that across enough that it doesn't matter to the people listening to this
[3:11:34.360 --> 3:11:40.360]  Whether you're completely sober or whether you're a teetotaler or whether you sip on whiskey
[3:11:40.360 --> 3:11:45.360]  Yeah, I'm a teetotaler. I mean, Kevin, you've known me for like 15 years
[3:11:45.360 --> 3:11:47.360]  You ever seen me smoke marijuana?
[3:11:47.360 --> 3:11:49.360]  No, never. It's just not part of your personality
[3:11:49.360 --> 3:11:55.360]  And I've been at parties and been Joe Rogan there and all these other people and I just do not like it
[3:11:55.360 --> 3:11:56.360]  And back to like what...
[3:11:56.360 --> 3:12:00.360]  I mean, my point is is that I am one total decriminalization
[3:12:00.360 --> 3:12:04.360]  Because I know marijuana is far less as bad and probably, and we know scientifically
[3:12:04.360 --> 3:12:07.360]  It's like a wonder drug like aloe vera or even better
[3:12:07.360 --> 3:12:12.360]  All of these are glaucoma and cancer. I mean, the admissions, the hundreds of drugs they've made out of it
[3:12:12.360 --> 3:12:16.360]  And it's not my opinion. George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin
[3:12:16.360 --> 3:12:20.360]  They all grew because hemp was their shirts. It was their...
[3:12:20.360 --> 3:12:26.360]  The rigging on the ships, the sails. It was the cotton of the day because it would grow in many more places than cotton
[3:12:26.360 --> 3:12:29.360]  I mean, in every climate basically except Antarctic or Arctic
[3:12:29.360 --> 3:12:33.360]  And just so amazing and they all wrote books about it and how wonderful it was
[3:12:33.360 --> 3:12:37.360]  But they also grew the one variety that would relax you
[3:12:37.360 --> 3:12:42.360]  And it was listed by medical doctors. You would go to the apothecary local drugstore
[3:12:42.360 --> 3:12:46.360]  And they would say smoke this in your pipe, but they'd mix it in with tobacco and inhale it
[3:12:46.360 --> 3:12:48.360]  And they would smoke...
[3:12:48.360 --> 3:12:54.360]  And I've read the old apothecary, you know, smoke the sexual buds of the plant
[3:12:54.360 --> 3:12:59.360]  You know, when it's going to seed, it would explain what types to smoke
[3:12:59.360 --> 3:13:04.360]  George Washington raised it on several thousand of his hundreds of thousands of acres
[3:13:04.360 --> 3:13:10.360]  I mean, this is a fact. This is a fraud. George Washington would have been swat teamed
[3:13:10.360 --> 3:13:16.360]  Yeah, no, exactly. And by the way that they've demonized it by mixing it all together
[3:13:16.360 --> 3:13:19.360]  In the same category with these horrible chemicals
[3:13:19.360 --> 3:13:23.360]  And the other thing that the DEA does too, and the drugs are does
[3:13:23.360 --> 3:13:27.360]  One of the ways they skew the lines is that they always tell you, well
[3:13:27.360 --> 3:13:32.360]  If you go and you look at the statistics of children being sent to rehabs and drug arrests
[3:13:32.360 --> 3:13:35.360]  Well, marijuana is the highest thing. Marijuana is just...
[3:13:35.360 --> 3:13:38.360]  Well, because you have to understand the way that they come up with those numbers
[3:13:38.360 --> 3:13:42.360]  Is that if you take a guy that does heroin, show me a guy that does heroin
[3:13:42.360 --> 3:13:47.360]  And he probably will also be a beer drinker, a cigarette smoker, and a pot smoker
[3:13:47.360 --> 3:13:50.360]  Show me a guy that does crystal meth. He's probably a beer drinker, a pot smoker
[3:13:50.360 --> 3:13:56.360]  You know what I mean? So anybody that does the harder drugs probably also does smoke marijuana
[3:13:56.360 --> 3:13:59.360]  And then they will use that as this big phony gateway
[3:13:59.360 --> 3:14:03.360]  Well, they also claim it's a gateway when really what it is, they tell you all drugs are bad
[3:14:03.360 --> 3:14:06.360]  Then you smoke marijuana and you're like, oh, well the other stuff must not be bad
[3:14:06.360 --> 3:14:11.360]  They say reefer madness, makes you run around murdering people as they taught in the 50s and 40s
[3:14:11.360 --> 3:14:14.360]  People then smoked it and felt like laying around on a couch giggling
[3:14:14.360 --> 3:14:19.360]  Or, you know, raiding the refrigerator, so they go, it must be lies, but here's the deal
[3:14:19.360 --> 3:14:22.360]  It's a very small percentage that tries a hard drug and likes it
[3:14:22.360 --> 3:14:27.360]  And I was among the majority that didn't. I mean, I tried cocaine and absolutely hated it
[3:14:27.360 --> 3:14:31.360]  And thought, this felt like when I'd been in a car wreck and, you know, adrenaline was up
[3:14:31.360 --> 3:14:34.360]  And I'd seen somebody killed, you know, in a car wreck
[3:14:34.360 --> 3:14:37.360]  I mean, it was like being freaked out in my heart beating
[3:14:37.360 --> 3:14:38.360]  I'm like, my God, I hate this
[3:14:38.360 --> 3:14:41.360]  And I tried speed once and threw up for two days
[3:14:41.360 --> 3:14:45.360]  And I'm like, my God, this is like getting the flu, paying to get the flu
[3:14:45.360 --> 3:14:49.360]  You know, you're at a party, you're 14, they go, here try this and you're throwing up for two days
[3:14:49.360 --> 3:14:55.360]  You know, thank God, I tried a few hard drugs, they were so horrible that I never did them again
[3:14:55.360 --> 3:15:01.360]  Some people like that stuff, but by being illegal, they then brew it all up with these toxic chemicals
[3:15:01.360 --> 3:15:06.360]  So it's 10 times more poisonous, instead of the old stuff Elvis did that, you know, gets you speedy
[3:15:06.360 --> 3:15:08.360]  But, you know, isn't as toxic waste
[3:15:08.360 --> 3:15:14.360]  But then luckily, I smoked marijuana some and just always hated it, every time I tried it
[3:15:14.360 --> 3:15:18.360]  And folks, don't get mad at me, you worship marijuana out there, I'm trying to get it recriminalized for you
[3:15:18.360 --> 3:15:21.360]  But at the same time, don't tell me I have to like it
[3:15:21.360 --> 3:15:24.360]  You know, Tommy Schoen called it an original thought
[3:15:24.360 --> 3:15:29.360]  I just didn't like being like, ugh, and you know, maybe that's me
[3:15:29.360 --> 3:15:33.360]  But the point is, different strokes for different folks, I have a different metabolism
[3:15:33.360 --> 3:15:37.360]  Than most people, I can drink Starbucks coffee and go to sleep, other people can't
[3:15:37.360 --> 3:15:42.360]  So I've got a different brain than some people, you know, I mean, but you get the point I'm making, Kevin
[3:15:42.360 --> 3:15:46.360]  Right, but let me tell you about two other things that this prohibition also causes
[3:15:46.360 --> 3:15:50.360]  Like, let's take that girl, that OD, in San Diego, okay, it's tragic
[3:15:50.360 --> 3:15:58.360]  But what is the reason, one of the reasons that she did OD is that because when people buy illegal drugs off the street
[3:15:58.360 --> 3:16:01.360]  There is absolutely no control over the strength
[3:16:01.360 --> 3:16:07.360]  And so these prohibitionary tactics create a situation where people that are out there doing heroin
[3:16:07.360 --> 3:16:10.360]  You don't know if you're getting 1% pure or 100% pure
[3:16:10.360 --> 3:16:16.360]  And there's just no way to tell when you're buying a powdered substance off of some gang member on the street
[3:16:16.360 --> 3:16:26.360]  And this prohibition is also causing your average old pot dealers in college to now have to sell cocaine and heroin and crystal meth
[3:16:26.360 --> 3:16:31.360]  In order to make a living because it's easier and more profitable to sell the harder drugs
[3:16:31.360 --> 3:16:35.360]  And that's what this prohibition has created
[3:16:35.360 --> 3:16:40.360]  It's a much easier to get caught smoking marijuana because of the bulk and the smell
[3:16:40.360 --> 3:16:46.360]  And it stays in your urine for 60 days versus whether you, if you do cocaine, it only stays in your urine for 72 hours
[3:16:46.360 --> 3:16:50.360]  Cocaine is much easier to conceal, cocaine, you can do it much quicker
[3:16:50.360 --> 3:16:55.360]  You can get away with it, you can sit there and do cocaine right in front of a bunch of people just by slipping off in the bathroom
[3:16:55.360 --> 3:16:58.360]  No one would ever know about it, but you can't do that with marijuana
[3:16:58.360 --> 3:17:02.360]  Exactly, for PrisonPlanet.TV, we just put up an image of Celica Stillo
[3:17:02.360 --> 3:17:08.360]  Poses with 600 kilos of cocaine seized and here he is on record with everybody else and the government brings the drugs in
[3:17:08.360 --> 3:17:11.360]  Yeah, absolutely, absolutely
[3:17:11.360 --> 3:17:21.360]  And it's just, you know, I just, you know, what I want people to do with my film, you know, I know a lot of it is preaching to the choir
[3:17:21.360 --> 3:17:26.360]  In these kind of situations and that a lot of people listening to this have probably already seen it or agree with it
[3:17:26.360 --> 3:17:33.360]  But what I want is for people to get a copy of American Drug War and to force the person that you know in your life
[3:17:33.360 --> 3:17:37.360]  The conservative person that does think that someone belongs in jail for some reason
[3:17:37.360 --> 3:17:40.360]  Well, let's be clear, they're not real conservatives, drugs weren't illegal in this country
[3:17:40.360 --> 3:17:44.360]  You can go in the drugstore and buy anything you wanted 80 years ago and there was less use
[3:17:44.360 --> 3:17:50.360]  So they're not real conservatives, they're chicken-necked, cowardly, control freak, nanny state lovers, go ahead
[3:17:50.360 --> 3:17:54.360]  No, absolutely, right, right, the so-called conservatives, whatever you want to label them
[3:17:54.360 --> 3:17:59.360]  But to get them to watch the film, that's what I'm, that's what I targeted
[3:17:59.360 --> 3:18:08.360]  I created this film and edited this film as a way to try to pry loose like some pretty hardcore beliefs
[3:18:08.360 --> 3:18:12.360]  And it was five years in the making and let me add, I've got a picture of the DEA with a marijuana drug bust
[3:18:12.360 --> 3:18:17.360]  They put money and a gun next to it to make it associate guns with drugs
[3:18:17.360 --> 3:18:20.360]  So now they're using the huge mechanism of anti-drug war they've got
[3:18:20.360 --> 3:18:23.360]  They're shifting that into the attack on the Second Amendment
[3:18:23.360 --> 3:18:28.360]  So all you good old boys out there, they're coming after your guns now with all these cops they've got
[3:18:28.360 --> 3:18:33.360]  Yeah, that's all they have to do is they, if they put a picture of like a pistol next to a bag of marijuana
[3:18:33.360 --> 3:18:39.360]  And a little stack of cash, then all of a sudden it's like, oh my god, oh my god, look, look at these horrible people
[3:18:39.360 --> 3:18:41.360]  Yeah, it's a vice versa demonization, yeah
[3:18:41.360 --> 3:18:45.360]  Yeah, no, it's the same old thing, it's the same, same old story
[3:18:45.360 --> 3:18:50.360]  People should check out this organization called LEAP, it's law enforcement against prohibition
[3:18:50.360 --> 3:18:53.360]  It's a LEAP.CC, I think
[3:18:53.360 --> 3:18:59.360]  And these are thousands of retired narcotics officers that now are almost like repenting for what they did
[3:18:59.360 --> 3:19:03.360]  Because they realize that they have destroyed hundreds of thousands of decent lives
[3:19:03.360 --> 3:19:08.360]  You know, there's drug war, we've got a situation now going on with the drug war where
[3:19:08.360 --> 3:19:13.360]  A 15-year-old kid in high school gets caught with a single joint
[3:19:13.360 --> 3:19:17.360]  And as a result of that, he can't get student loans, he's not going to go to college now
[3:19:17.360 --> 3:19:20.360]  And so instead of going to college, he's going to go to prison
[3:19:20.360 --> 3:19:24.360]  Now, can you tell me like how that helps our society at all on any level?
[3:19:24.360 --> 3:19:29.360]  Well, they also glorify the DEA, I'm looking at Pamela Anderson dressed up like one
[3:19:29.360 --> 3:19:33.360]  I mean, I'm just sick of all their propaganda, they're a bunch of drug dealing thugs
[3:19:33.360 --> 3:19:35.360]  Who are too cowardly to be regular thugs
[3:19:35.360 --> 3:19:39.360]  They've got to run around like they're good guys, and I've just had enough of it
[3:19:39.360 --> 3:19:45.360]  We're going to take infowars.com calls during the break and then come back to everybody with Genesis calls
[3:19:45.360 --> 3:19:50.360]  The Federal Trade Commission estimates that 9 million Americans are victims of identity theft each year
[3:19:50.360 --> 3:19:56.360]  The crime of identity theft occurs every 3.5 seconds, costing the victims an average of $8,000
[3:19:56.360 --> 3:19:59.360]  If you own a PC, passwords are a common form of authentication
[3:19:59.360 --> 3:20:03.360]  And often the only protection between a hacker and your personal information

[3:22:21.360 --> 3:22:25.360]  This union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation
[3:22:25.360 --> 3:22:28.360]  America and Papal Rome are uniting in this agenda

[3:23:54.360 --> 3:23:58.360]  Oh yeah, we're taking calls during the break for people listening at infoawards.com
[3:23:58.360 --> 3:24:00.360]  Some behind the scenes stuff and prisonplanner.tv
[3:24:00.360 --> 3:24:04.360]  When I call us a nation of cowardly scum, a nation of idiots
[3:24:04.360 --> 3:24:07.360]  It's so you'll wake up and not be a nation of idiots
[3:24:07.360 --> 3:24:10.360]  I love this country, this has been the greatest country in history
[3:24:10.360 --> 3:24:15.360]  The most inventions, the most wealth, the hardest fighting, I mean we have been it
[3:24:15.360 --> 3:24:19.360]  But we sat on our laurels and have become degenerate scum
[3:24:19.360 --> 3:24:23.360]  Again, they paid 14, 15 cents in Venezuela for a gallon of gas
[3:24:23.360 --> 3:24:26.360]  In US dollars, we pay $4
[3:24:26.360 --> 3:24:32.360]  They paid about three times, four times, paying on the drug less in Mexico than we pay
[3:24:32.360 --> 3:24:36.360]  We pay more for gas, more for legal drugs, more for everything here
[3:24:36.360 --> 3:24:39.360]  We're idiots, we're idiots
[3:24:39.360 --> 3:24:44.360]  I mean they're passing global warming fake environment taxes all over
[3:24:44.360 --> 3:24:48.360]  It's all scams, they treat us like morons, the left and the right
[3:24:48.360 --> 3:24:53.360]  And so when I call everybody idiots, I'm saying stop being con
[3:24:53.360 --> 3:24:56.360]  I mean we are a pathetic country and it's getting dangerous
[3:24:56.360 --> 3:25:00.360]  The cops and the corrupt drug dealing government have decided to just take everything over
[3:25:00.360 --> 3:25:05.360]  That's what Homeland Security is, I mean they're saying no more free market, no more nothing, we own you
[3:25:05.360 --> 3:25:09.360]  And Kevin was just making the point, caller called in and said, well why is Hopp still allowed to be grown?
[3:25:09.360 --> 3:25:14.360]  It's in the hemp family, yeah they banned like something, what is it, 25 different forms of hemp
[3:25:14.360 --> 3:25:20.360]  There's like more than a hundred, but all of those don't have a THC except one variety
[3:25:20.360 --> 3:25:22.360]  And then only one sex of the species
[3:25:22.360 --> 3:25:27.360]  But in the 30s, they paid the federal government to go around to public schools and teach and show them
[3:25:27.360 --> 3:25:31.360]  Film clips of people murdering and killing and killing babies
[3:25:31.360 --> 3:25:36.360]  And like the sheriff smokes some and then murders everybody
[3:25:36.360 --> 3:25:39.360]  I mean just totally man, they said my god we gotta ban it
[3:25:39.360 --> 3:25:48.360]  So they banned all of these types used for oils, used for cotton, hemp cotton, fabric, ropes
[3:25:48.360 --> 3:25:54.360]  And it could be grown anywhere and Kevin made the point that they're doing this because they want to ban it everywhere
[3:25:54.360 --> 3:26:00.360]  They have to ban something that can be done at the family farm level that is so such an amazing
[3:26:00.360 --> 3:26:02.360]  Amazing plant, Kevin?
[3:26:02.360 --> 3:26:08.360]  Because if people were allowed, say everybody with a little bit of land could grow enough of this stuff
[3:26:08.360 --> 3:26:17.360]  You know I could list thousands of pharmaceutical drugs that would probably just go out of business immediately
[3:26:17.360 --> 3:26:24.360]  Anything for depression, anxiety, sleeplessness, nausea, heartburn, indigestion
[3:26:24.360 --> 3:26:31.360]  Just goes on and on and on and not to mention the fact that you can make all the fuels from it, the oil fuels
[3:26:31.360 --> 3:26:33.360]  We could probably have hand powered cars
[3:26:33.360 --> 3:26:39.360]  And it's literally a weed, it isn't like corn, you need lots of water and fertilizer for it, it grows everywhere
[3:26:39.360 --> 3:26:45.360]  Yeah, just the idea that they've made something that grows naturally everywhere
[3:26:45.360 --> 3:26:51.360]  And they've made it so you can go to jail for growing a plant that already grows everywhere naturally
[3:26:51.360 --> 3:26:56.360]  Should just tell everybody it doesn't matter, it says nothing to do with wanting to get stoned
[3:26:56.360 --> 3:27:01.360]  Now let's be clear, they banned in the 30s, DuPont and Alchemical
[3:27:01.360 --> 3:27:07.360]  They banned varieties that have no THC
[3:27:09.360 --> 3:27:13.360]  I guess Kelly's gone, Kelly and Iowa, you just hung up?
[3:27:13.360 --> 3:27:17.360]  Yes, anything else Kelly?
[3:27:17.360 --> 3:27:24.360]  I was reading like a 1903 study, I think it was from the Rockefeller Foundation
[3:27:24.360 --> 3:27:34.360]  Where basically when Henry Ford was starting out his car company, a lot of it he was making out of hemp
[3:27:34.360 --> 3:27:43.360]  And they basically, from what they could tell, is that hemp could pretty much take away 70% of DuPont business
[3:27:43.360 --> 3:27:50.360]  And the British were in Vietnam and Thailand with the rubber for the tires and hemp makes better tires
[3:27:50.360 --> 3:27:54.360]  And he was already making composite that was going to be plastic cars like we have now
[3:27:54.360 --> 3:27:57.360]  And they just said, you want a SWAT team to drop by?
[3:27:57.360 --> 3:28:03.360]  Shut up slave, you're trash, we're banning a plant that helps America but has no drugs in it
[3:28:03.360 --> 3:28:06.360]  Shut up your slaves and that's the end of it, anything else?
[3:28:06.360 --> 3:28:07.360]  Exactly
[3:28:07.360 --> 3:28:12.360]  No man, it's just a nation of idiots, anything else?
[3:28:12.360 --> 3:28:14.360]  Nope, that's it, thanks for your talking guys
[3:28:14.360 --> 3:28:17.360]  It makes me sick, doesn't it make you sick Kevin?
[3:28:17.360 --> 3:28:22.360]  Yeah, no, it's just sad, it's just sad of how
[3:28:22.360 --> 3:28:23.360]  A nation of idiots
[3:28:23.360 --> 3:28:29.360]  It makes me sad of how they were able to sell my parents on it and how my parents both went to their grave
[3:28:29.360 --> 3:28:35.360]  As heavy alcohol drinkers thinking that all this was true, it just makes me sad
[3:28:35.360 --> 3:28:40.360]  The government admits what alcohol kills over 300 thou a year, marijuana not one person
[3:28:40.360 --> 3:28:47.360]  Exactly, but they will still on their website just say marijuana is a dangerous thing
[3:28:47.360 --> 3:28:53.360]  They've done national polls, over 70% want to decriminalize marijuana, 80% want out of the war
[3:28:53.360 --> 3:28:56.360]  90% want to control the borders, ain't none of it happening
[3:28:56.360 --> 3:29:04.360]  Because we have an armed camp of criminals that work for foreign banks that own and rule this nation of cowardly scumbag idiots
[3:29:04.360 --> 3:29:11.360]  It's just sad, it's sad, but I have to agree with Tommy a little bit
[3:29:11.360 --> 3:29:17.360]  And I hope that in the end this could kind of be a renaissance
[3:29:17.360 --> 3:29:23.360]  And that in order for a revolution or change to take place, you've got to hit a bottom
[3:29:23.360 --> 3:29:26.360]  And hopefully this is our bottom that we're hitting now
[3:29:26.360 --> 3:29:28.360]  It's death camps, mass graves, total control
[3:29:28.360 --> 3:29:33.360]  Zach, Chris, Richard and Scotland, Steve, Will, your calls are straight ahead on the other side
[3:29:33.360 --> 3:29:35.360]  Well, they're talking behind the scenes right now
[3:29:35.360 --> 3:29:38.360]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run
[3:29:38.360 --> 3:29:42.360]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[3:29:45.360 --> 3:29:49.360]  It is a big idea, a new world order
[3:29:49.360 --> 3:29:54.360]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful ruling government
[3:29:54.360 --> 3:30:00.360]  It's known as the Bilderberg, but their objective being world domination
[3:30:00.360 --> 3:30:03.360]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew
[3:30:03.360 --> 3:30:11.360]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand
[3:30:14.360 --> 3:30:19.360]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open
[3:30:19.360 --> 3:30:23.360]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda
[3:30:23.360 --> 3:30:26.360]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government
[3:30:26.360 --> 3:30:29.360]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need
[3:30:29.360 --> 3:30:31.360]  They're after power, yes they're after nature

[3:30:44.360 --> 3:30:47.360]  Hi, this is Dave from Ready Reserve Foods
[3:30:47.360 --> 3:30:54.360]  I have been waiting patiently for the government and mainstream media to inform you of what is turning out to be the biggest problem facing the world in the last 50 years
[3:30:54.360 --> 3:31:00.360]  For the last three years, the earth has consumed more food than it has been able to produce, and it has now finally caught up with this
[3:31:00.360 --> 3:31:07.360]  In the U.S. commodities such as flour and rice are already being rationed and the next rice crop won't be available for another four to five months
[3:31:07.360 --> 3:31:14.360]  It's fall in the southern hemisphere, and many countries are short the food necessary to make it through the winter and have stopped exporting certain commodities altogether
[3:31:14.360 --> 3:31:16.360]  Remember our trade deficit?
[3:31:16.360 --> 3:31:22.360]  Trillions of dollars have stacked up outside the country and are now rushing in to buy our food production at any price
[3:31:22.360 --> 3:31:28.360]  Late summer, if not early fall, it is likely our government will step in and control food and food exports under martial law

[3:31:45.360 --> 3:31:50.360]  We're already under a scientific dictatorship
[3:31:50.360 --> 3:31:53.360]  Martial law is coming, but it's not going to arrive overnight
[3:31:53.360 --> 3:31:55.360]  It's going to be incremental
[3:31:55.360 --> 3:31:57.360]  This country is already teetering on the edge
[3:31:57.360 --> 3:32:00.360]  Any incidents small or large could trigger a total takeover
[3:32:00.360 --> 3:32:02.360]  Anything could be the final push

[3:32:11.360 --> 3:32:16.360]  Learn how to act around controlling troops and how to use their own psychology against them through social engineering
[3:32:16.360 --> 3:32:19.360]  When martial law is officially announced, checkpoints will be enforced
[3:32:19.360 --> 3:32:23.360]  Confiscations will occur for registered gun owners and cities will be on lockdown
[3:32:23.360 --> 3:32:27.360]  You will be dealing with a force that has been in training for years preparing for this takeover

[3:32:55.360 --> 3:32:58.360]  By the way, that new band I like out of Denver, Flo Botte
[3:32:58.360 --> 3:33:01.360]  Set up for the show next Wednesday
[3:33:01.360 --> 3:33:04.360]  They got some other really big guest next week
[3:33:04.360 --> 3:33:09.560]  big guess this week. Maybe Tommy Chung. We're going to have an exclusive of Cheech with him soon.
[3:33:10.360 --> 3:33:14.120]  They just got back together. National tour starting the next few months. And
[3:33:16.680 --> 3:33:22.280]  we're also, of course, have Jesse Ventura back on. Big guess tomorrow, not tomorrow, excuse me,
[3:33:22.280 --> 3:33:28.680]  next week. I think of weeks this day. So tomorrow, the next week, time goes by so fast.
[3:33:28.680 --> 3:33:35.240]  I wonder who's coming on. Hint, hint.
[3:33:41.000 --> 3:33:43.480]  All right, let's cut all these calls on the main network line.
[3:33:45.000 --> 3:33:48.920]  Richard in Scotland, you are on the air, sir.
[3:33:50.360 --> 3:33:53.480]  All right, Alex, how's it going, man? Good, sir. How's things in Texas?
[3:33:54.440 --> 3:33:57.800]  It's all right. It's already 100 degrees last week one day, so we're heating up.
[3:33:57.800 --> 3:34:02.120]  Burmese is from New York, and he's already thinking it's the hottest thing he's ever seen,
[3:34:02.120 --> 3:34:07.400]  and we're explaining to him that 110. So he's going to feel like he's living in a bread oven.
[3:34:08.920 --> 3:34:12.920]  It's about 90 degrees over here, and it's pretty warm. Can't wait to torture Burmese with the
[3:34:12.920 --> 3:34:17.640]  heat. I'm looking at him right now. I like having Burmese around. He's a smiley face creature.
[3:34:17.640 --> 3:34:20.920]  Anyways, I'm sorry, sir, from Scotland. You're on the air with Lord Booth.
[3:34:20.920 --> 3:34:26.200]  All right, Kevin, how's it going, man? Hey, good. How's it going? Not bad. Not bad. That's why
[3:34:26.200 --> 3:34:30.040]  they thanks for all your work as well, man, because I've got some of your stuff about your
[3:34:30.040 --> 3:34:33.800]  book on Bill Hicks and stuff, and I didn't realize you were the same. Kevin,
[3:34:33.800 --> 3:34:37.720]  that Alex speaks about until he started talking about you and Bill going to the Brash Davidians.
[3:34:38.360 --> 3:34:43.480]  Oh, yeah. The penny dropped, if you know what I mean. I just wondered if you'd read
[3:34:43.480 --> 3:34:50.040]  the Alfred McCoy's book on the politics on heroin. Yes, I have. It's been a while,
[3:34:50.040 --> 3:34:57.160]  but yeah, definitely it's a very complicated, lengthy book, and I came very close to interviewing
[3:34:57.160 --> 3:35:02.280]  him. It just didn't work out. Yeah, I've actually interviewed him a couple times.
[3:35:02.280 --> 3:35:06.760]  Yeah, it's definitely a very, very powerful book. I recommend that. I recommend reading
[3:35:06.760 --> 3:35:11.640]  Dark Alliance. Those are probably two of the big bibles, you know, besides selling custodians.
[3:35:11.640 --> 3:35:15.400]  By the way, there's no doubt. There's no doubt they killed Gary Webb. You don't shoot yourself
[3:35:15.400 --> 3:35:21.160]  twice in the head. I know one of your sources in the film is a very nice guy, but he's wrong
[3:35:21.160 --> 3:35:25.880]  about that. Right. No, I know. I was just having to go with, like, once again, just so I wouldn't
[3:35:25.880 --> 3:35:30.680]  be blamed. I was just saying this was what the party line was. This is what they told us. That
[3:35:30.680 --> 3:35:33.640]  was kind of the point. Well, just to see if they shoot me twice in the head, I didn't commit
[3:35:33.640 --> 3:35:38.200]  suicide. I believe it. Please, for God's sakes. I mean, they just killed the DC madam. She was
[3:35:38.200 --> 3:35:41.720]  on my show saying, I'll never commit suicide. They're after me. She told friends they're planning
[3:35:41.720 --> 3:35:47.480]  to kill me. Oh, no. That's what I was talking about. We should start an anti-suicide league
[3:35:47.480 --> 3:35:52.920]  where everybody, you know, that wants to sign a thing saying if I suddenly end up shot, I did
[3:35:52.920 --> 3:35:56.680]  not commit suicide and we could be a, yeah, because then they'll have government spooks or
[3:35:56.680 --> 3:36:01.640]  well-known operatives pop up and say, Oh, she called me magically and said she was. Yeah.
[3:36:02.600 --> 3:36:05.880]  Any sons of bitches, excuse me. Anybody does that. It's a lie with me.
[3:36:05.880 --> 3:36:11.480]  Yeah. And the tricky thing with Gary was that, you know, you have like the whole thing with his
[3:36:11.480 --> 3:36:16.840]  wife being involved and then owning the rights to his book and the film rights. And, you know,
[3:36:16.840 --> 3:36:21.880]  it just, it just became like all these other situations where it's like, Oh, it's, you know,
[3:36:21.880 --> 3:36:25.880]  saying that it was a suicide is too upsetting to the family. So just, you know, everybody go
[3:36:25.880 --> 3:36:30.440]  along with the story and please be quiet. Yeah. Cause, cause they don't want to get killed.
[3:36:30.440 --> 3:36:36.680]  Yeah. Anything else? Richard in Scotland. And yeah, I just wonder what your thoughts on the
[3:36:36.680 --> 3:36:43.080]  UK reclassifying cannabis back to a class B and substance because Tony Blair put it down to a
[3:36:43.080 --> 3:36:49.320]  class C about four or five years ago. Yeah. They always do a stunt to make you think they're liberal
[3:36:49.320 --> 3:36:54.440]  or reasonable, but of course, I mean, sir, they now arrest you in the UK for dropping a banana
[3:36:54.440 --> 3:37:00.360]  peel or, or, or, you know, as you know, it's the same thing here now. It's maximum enforcement. It's,
[3:37:00.360 --> 3:37:05.400]  we are the slaves. We have to realize that to become human again and then not be slaves anymore.
[3:37:05.400 --> 3:37:10.440]  Our government's gone bad. It's gone rogue. Our governments are exactly the same and it's disgusting.
[3:37:10.440 --> 3:37:13.560]  Yeah. They're trying to ratchet the laws back up. Kevin, you got a comment on that?
[3:37:13.560 --> 3:37:17.560]  Yeah. I mean, it's kind of remember how Tommy was talking about how, how they bust people
[3:37:17.560 --> 3:37:21.480]  with crystal meth and all of a sudden they'll say there's, you know, is this many things with
[3:37:21.480 --> 3:37:26.520]  the word that they use, the DEA uses a dosage unit. Like if somebody gets arrested with,
[3:37:26.520 --> 3:37:32.360]  with mushrooms, they'll, they'll say like, oh, those two caps of mushrooms were like, you know,
[3:37:32.360 --> 3:37:36.680]  10,000 dosage units and you can get X amount of years for each dose of units.
[3:37:36.680 --> 3:37:43.240]  Now to be clear though, and I've seen these cases, the, the, the mushroom head might get one person
[3:37:43.240 --> 3:37:48.200]  hallucinating a little bit, but they'll say, no, that's, that's dealing 10,000. See, we've
[3:37:48.200 --> 3:37:53.720]  re, I mean, we've come into a corruption level now where it's just La La Land. Got a, Kevin,
[3:37:53.720 --> 3:37:57.160]  did you see the front line there a few weeks ago and they've got a, where, where they had
[3:37:57.160 --> 3:38:02.600]  show Texas where the private, present corporations lobby to put people in jail for, for, for
[3:38:02.600 --> 3:38:06.840]  speeding and stuff. No, I haven't seen that. I mean, there's a new reign of terror, Kevin,
[3:38:06.840 --> 3:38:09.320]  where it's just like you speed and you never see your wife again.
[3:38:10.120 --> 3:38:14.680]  Incredible. Incredible. But back to what he said about the, the scheduling and that is,
[3:38:14.680 --> 3:38:20.520]  you know, it sounds good on paper and it looks, and it makes a good story and it makes everybody
[3:38:20.520 --> 3:38:26.280]  go, oh, okay, you know, everything's cool again. But even if they moved to marijuana to say schedule
[3:38:26.280 --> 3:38:31.160]  two or schedule three here in the United States, it's, it's still people, it's not going to stop
[3:38:31.160 --> 3:38:35.880]  them, you know, it's, it's just like a front for how dangerous it is to say it's like schedule one.
[3:38:35.880 --> 3:38:39.800]  So they'll, they'll still, they'll still arrest you for whatever schedule it is.
[3:38:39.800 --> 3:38:46.520]  Yeah. But we need to decriminalize now, not next week. And of course, the drug dealers,
[3:38:46.520 --> 3:38:51.320]  I guarantee you the drug dealers would kill anybody who really was trying to repeal stuff
[3:38:51.320 --> 3:38:55.160]  because that's where they make all their money. Folks, anybody who does the government controls
[3:38:55.160 --> 3:39:00.120]  and deals and wanders the drug money, bottom line, that's why there's so much money because
[3:39:00.120 --> 3:39:05.640]  it's illegal. It's two plus two. And that's why I say our country is so stupid. But really,
[3:39:05.640 --> 3:39:09.080]  it's not the majority of us don't want the drug war, but it doesn't end because the
[3:39:09.080 --> 3:39:14.920]  government is rogue and criminal. I appreciate your call, Richard.
[3:39:15.480 --> 3:39:20.200]  Hey, yeah, real quick, check out American, the movie. It's going to be a new documentary
[3:39:20.200 --> 3:39:26.520]  about Bill Hicks coming out made by my friends there in London, Matt Harlock and Paul Thomas.
[3:39:26.520 --> 3:39:32.680]  So go to americanthemovie.com. Awesome. Let's go ahead and talk to Zach in Canada.
[3:39:32.680 --> 3:39:35.160]  Zach, you're on the air with Kevin Booth, American Drug War.
[3:39:35.160 --> 3:39:41.080]  Hey, guys. Hey. Hey, here's some more scary stuff. Have you guys heard of Bill C-51?
[3:39:41.800 --> 3:39:46.280]  It's going through in Canada up here. No, I mean, what's it do? Just throw
[3:39:46.280 --> 3:39:48.760]  five-year-olds in prison for looking at marijuana on Arizona?
[3:39:49.400 --> 3:39:54.200]  Oh, no, not that bad yet. Basically, well, basically, they'll be throwing you in prison
[3:39:54.200 --> 3:39:59.320]  out for having vitamins and stuff. Oh, yeah, I did see that. Yeah, they're going to ban all the
[3:39:59.320 --> 3:40:03.640]  vitamins and make you pay 500 bucks for fish oil. I'm not kidding. I know what I mean. It's
[3:40:03.640 --> 3:40:13.720]  just lawless criminals running everything. It says that under the SPP, it'll also affect America and
[3:40:13.720 --> 3:40:20.360]  Mexico. It'll become law there. Yeah, no, that's part of the Codex Alimentarius. Here's the deal.
[3:40:20.360 --> 3:40:23.800]  They're very mad that people are self-medicating. I'm sure there's some bull out there, but there's
[3:40:23.800 --> 3:40:28.600]  more bull and you don't hear about vitamins killing 300,000 people a year like prescription drugs.
[3:40:28.600 --> 3:40:32.600]  And so they're just going to make everything prescription and they're going to shut everything
[3:40:32.600 --> 3:40:38.600]  down incrementally. And they're talking about, they've already SWAT team-rated aloe vera facilities.
[3:40:38.600 --> 3:40:41.800]  Kevin, did you hear about that last year when they SWAT teamed an aloe vera facility?
[3:40:41.800 --> 3:40:42.920]  No, I didn't hear that one either.
[3:40:43.560 --> 3:40:47.160]  Yeah, they're now claiming that if you drink a bunch of aloe vera, it gets you high,
[3:40:47.160 --> 3:40:51.800]  which is pure bull. And they've raided a bunch of other herb places now. I mean,
[3:40:51.800 --> 3:40:54.120]  there's no end. There's no end to these criminals.
[3:40:54.120 --> 3:40:57.960]  That's crazy. Rutteger is on aloe vera. It really helps the stiffness, but I'm pretty
[3:40:57.960 --> 3:41:02.440]  sure they'll start arresting us if you lick a toad or if you drink some fish oil.
[3:41:02.440 --> 3:41:07.160]  No, no, they do arrest people for licking toads. No, I mean, they had a raid and they caught
[3:41:07.160 --> 3:41:11.240]  them with the toads. Well, you know, there's that toad that's got poison on his back.
[3:41:11.240 --> 3:41:14.760]  Right. I know. I know. Yeah, you lick its eye and you're supposed to hallucinate.
[3:41:14.760 --> 3:41:19.880]  Oh my God. I tried that this morning, actually. I do that every morning when I set a coffee.
[3:41:20.760 --> 3:41:27.160]  That's a joke. That'll be the New York Times. It's a joke. It's a joke. Okay. Anything else, Zach?
[3:41:27.160 --> 3:41:30.120]  Oh, yeah. Another thing I noticed how in the army, I noticed the
[3:41:30.840 --> 3:41:37.400]  the rapes were at like around 3000 of like officers in the army. And I see how they're
[3:41:37.400 --> 3:41:43.000]  letting more and more, uh, I guess criminals in, except they're not letting any, any people who
[3:41:43.000 --> 3:41:47.960]  use pod into the army. Yeah, I've got to be one of the drug users that like the marijuana users.
[3:41:47.960 --> 3:41:51.080]  Guess where the largest? Well, that's because the military hands out
[3:41:51.080 --> 3:41:57.720]  military grade in fedamins to everybody. Thanks for the call. They call Mickey's. What do they call
[3:41:57.720 --> 3:42:03.320]  those? It's what Elvis, his commander, he was so patriotic when he was in the military and 20
[3:42:03.320 --> 3:42:07.400]  something in Germany. This is admitted. His commander was making him do four or five events
[3:42:07.400 --> 3:42:12.120]  every Saturday and Sunday. He said, I'm too tired, boss. And he said, look, take these and they
[3:42:12.120 --> 3:42:16.680]  ordered Elvis to take the in fedamins. Yeah, I think a Mickey is something that knocks you out.
[3:42:16.680 --> 3:42:22.280]  I know what you're talking about. Oh, what's the one that they take that's the pure in fedamins?
[3:42:22.840 --> 3:42:27.400]  Send them to give the school kids. It's different than, uh, than, uh, like Benny's or what is it?
[3:42:27.400 --> 3:42:31.240]  Benny's, Ben's and Ian's, Ben's, Ian's or whatever the drug. Yeah.
[3:42:31.960 --> 3:42:36.120]  But, uh, I don't know, just back to that last call or, uh, I don't know if you're aware of the,
[3:42:36.120 --> 3:42:42.840]  the new bill that's up right now with Barney Frank and, and, uh, Ron Paul, that's one of the things
[3:42:42.840 --> 3:42:46.840]  that's called a make room for serious criminals. And the other one is about medical marijuana,
[3:42:46.840 --> 3:42:51.960]  but it's, uh, we've got a deal right now where we're, we'll send a free copy of American drug
[3:42:51.960 --> 3:42:56.760]  war to your senator or your congressman or your state representative. Uh, if you go to American
[3:42:56.760 --> 3:43:02.920]  drug war.com. All right, let's go ahead and take another call here. Chris in Idaho, you're on the
[3:43:02.920 --> 3:43:13.560]  air worldwide. Go ahead. You're on the air, Chris. Chris? Yeah, Deloitte. Yeah, I'm here. Okay,
[3:43:13.560 --> 3:43:15.800]  buddy, you're on the air. We're going to have to let you go in a minute if you don't talk.
[3:43:17.000 --> 3:43:22.840]  My name is Deloitte Scott. I was, uh, attacked by, uh, two police officers here in court
[3:43:22.840 --> 3:43:28.360]  of lane last week. No, you are. I didn't have a headlight on my bicycle. Well, I was tased
[3:43:28.360 --> 3:43:35.400]  into compliance. They tried to tase me into compliance. Did it make your head? They actually
[3:43:35.400 --> 3:43:41.720]  helped me down. Hey, that's a good idea. They're going to get on the bike and then put your tongue
[3:43:41.720 --> 3:43:47.160]  on the wires, put the wire in your mouth and then, and then they'll ride behind you tasing you
[3:43:47.160 --> 3:43:52.680]  down the street to light the light. That's good, Kevin. I don't mean to laugh at you.
[3:43:52.680 --> 3:44:00.040]  Tell me the story, slave of what your God did. Tell me. I was writing down the, I was writing
[3:44:00.040 --> 3:44:06.280]  down the street. An officer said what I believe to be high and I said high back and waved and
[3:44:06.840 --> 3:44:13.000]  he asked me if I had an identification. I said I don't need it. You waved at it. Hold on. Oh,
[3:44:13.000 --> 3:44:18.200]  stop right there. See, acting like you're on the same level as a fellow human. You're, you're,
[3:44:18.200 --> 3:44:24.200]  you're, you're whale scum. You're whale poop. Okay. You're lower than that. You don't wave.
[3:44:24.200 --> 3:44:31.720]  You should have bowed like it was the Pope. Boy, now you tell me what you did. You shut
[3:44:31.720 --> 3:44:37.560]  your mouth, slave. This country's run musk. Tell me what happened. Tell me how that officer
[3:44:37.560 --> 3:44:42.200]  puts you in your place. Tell me how you put you in your place, slave. Tell me what happened.
[3:44:42.200 --> 3:44:52.120]  He asked for identification. I told him, I asked him if I was under investigation for a crime.
[3:44:52.120 --> 3:44:57.080]  He said, yes, you are. And I said, I need my assistance to counsel. So at that point in time,
[3:44:57.080 --> 3:45:02.600]  I shouldn't have had to say anything more. And they decided they would threaten me with going
[3:45:02.600 --> 3:45:12.600]  to jail. And when I demanded I see the warrant and the affidavits, they tased me. And one of the
[3:45:12.600 --> 3:45:17.160]  officers come around to grab me thinking that I was still hooked up. I had pulled the taser out of me.
[3:45:17.880 --> 3:45:24.680]  And he spun around after realizing I was still up and capable. And he lost his flashlight.
[3:45:25.320 --> 3:45:29.880]  And I grabbed his flashlight and I said, you little MF, you tased me. I couldn't believe
[3:45:29.880 --> 3:45:33.320]  that he had done that. And what was he doing? Crap in his pants? See if I bet he pulled a gun on
[3:45:33.320 --> 3:45:41.000]  you. Little coward. Oh, he run. He run. Cowardly scum. Absolute filth assaulting you with a deadly
[3:45:41.000 --> 3:45:47.560]  weapon out on a dark road. He's been in Iraq, probably running off. What? Then they tased me
[3:45:47.560 --> 3:45:56.040]  again. And so wait a minute. Tell me about the coward running. So he tased you to get his pleasure.
[3:45:56.040 --> 3:46:02.360]  You pulled it out. What happened next? He tased you for sexual pleasure. He grabbed me.
[3:46:03.560 --> 3:46:08.840]  And when he realized I was still capable of moving and defending myself, then he turned
[3:46:08.840 --> 3:46:13.560]  around and ran. And when he turned, he spun around real quick and he dropped his flashlight.
[3:46:14.600 --> 3:46:20.680]  And I decided, hey, I need that. And that's what kept them off me for a period of time. There was
[3:46:20.680 --> 3:46:26.360]  people videotaping. There was close to two dozen witnesses out here. Oh my God, I've got to have the video.
[3:46:27.160 --> 3:46:30.520]  You'd have been dead. You'd have been dead if it wasn't video. What else happened? Tell me what else.
[3:46:32.040 --> 3:46:37.480]  Well, here's supervisor came. I said, I want these guys arrested. They assaulted me. And
[3:46:38.840 --> 3:46:42.680]  I said, I want the sheriff out here. You guys don't have jurisdiction over me. Your employees
[3:46:42.680 --> 3:46:47.960]  are the corporation. And they tased you again. They turned around and said, you're under arrest
[3:46:47.960 --> 3:46:53.720]  and shot me with a taser again. I took the flashlight. See, stop, stop, stop, stop. See,
[3:46:53.720 --> 3:46:58.760]  that was your punishment. That was your punishment. My punishment is yet to come.
[3:46:59.320 --> 3:47:06.920]  My punishment is yet to come. Oh, you're on the run. So then as I went after him and hit him in
[3:47:06.920 --> 3:47:12.680]  the head, I was attacked. I was jumped on from behind by two guys. I hope they know that down
[3:47:12.680 --> 3:47:18.600]  on the ground and they tasered me again. And I mean, this time the tasers went in my back really
[3:47:18.600 --> 3:47:23.720]  well, really close to my heart. Those guys attempted to murder me. Were they having orgasms
[3:47:23.720 --> 3:47:28.040]  while they were doing it? I've seen cops and they do it go, oh, God, I hate America. Oh,
[3:47:28.040 --> 3:47:33.000]  it feels so good. Oh, yes. Oh God, I'm just throwing freedom. I've got the power. I've got the power
[3:47:33.000 --> 3:47:39.080]  on the boss. Oh God, I hate freedom. Oh, I love it. I mean, what were they doing? Well, my face
[3:47:39.080 --> 3:47:43.800]  was pushed into the sidewalk, so I couldn't tell whether they were having an orgasm or not. Oh,
[3:47:43.800 --> 3:47:53.160]  God, I hate freedom. Oh, yes. It's an officer orgasm. And I was denied a phone call. I was
[3:47:53.160 --> 3:47:57.880]  denied assistance account. Okay, so what's happening now? What's happening now? Give them my name until
[3:47:57.880 --> 3:48:03.720]  I was being a rain. They still knew me as John Doe. That made them so mad. But you've got video. Do
[3:48:03.720 --> 3:48:10.120]  you have video of the assault with the deadly weapons? I do have. God, you got to get that on
[3:48:10.120 --> 3:48:17.000]  YouTube immediately. Well, why did these mad dogs attack you? Because I didn't have a flashlight
[3:48:17.000 --> 3:48:22.360]  or a headlight on my bike. No, I understand that part. Well, they got nothing to do. They're just
[3:48:22.360 --> 3:48:29.320]  hiring more of these felons. Are these guys felons? Well, one of them is up on steroids. I mean,
[3:48:29.320 --> 3:48:36.520]  he's got 18 inch biceps. Oh, I know. He doesn't have any neck. But he's the guy who approached me.
[3:48:37.160 --> 3:48:40.920]  But no doubt, he can't say that he can't have sex with a woman because he's
[3:48:40.920 --> 3:48:45.480]  destroyed his real manhood. These guys definitely, they either got beat up in high school or they
[3:48:45.480 --> 3:48:50.040]  were like the high school bully who then couldn't get a real job. And they can't get real women
[3:48:50.040 --> 3:48:55.080]  either. They're real mad. Yeah. Yeah, I think his testicles are about the size of a green pea.
[3:48:55.080 --> 3:48:59.160]  Oh, let's stop. This is getting out of control. We have a lot of people listening.
[3:49:01.720 --> 3:49:06.600]  You're a slave. Now, what's your criminal name? Slave scum. And where do you live?
[3:49:09.320 --> 3:49:16.360]  The court of Lane, Idaho. You're an Alcada criminal. My name is Deloitte Scott. And I was,
[3:49:16.360 --> 3:49:20.360]  they knew after I was in there 12 hours, they knew that they had a problem and they started
[3:49:20.360 --> 3:49:26.520]  using up on me. But there's still a little Nazi down there on the night shift that thinks he's
[3:49:26.520 --> 3:49:31.080]  got down there. Well, don't worry, he's scum. He doesn't realize what's about to happen to him.
[3:49:31.080 --> 3:49:33.960]  Well, they don't know what's going to happen when we take this country back. They're going to be
[3:49:33.960 --> 3:49:41.000]  some serious problems for redcoats. Now, let's go back here. What ended up happening when you
[3:49:41.000 --> 3:49:47.960]  were brought before the corrupt little, little Mason in the black robe? Well, actually, he didn't
[3:49:47.960 --> 3:49:57.000]  have a robot. So there was a bath on that worshiper out. Okay, so what happened? He gave me a $150,000
[3:49:57.000 --> 3:50:03.240]  bail. And I told him this was BS and a whole bunch of things. I raised my hand, I'll hit
[3:50:03.240 --> 3:50:10.600]  there and said paper stays. And this is on the the arraignment court tape. I guarantee you.
[3:50:10.600 --> 3:50:13.560]  Well, listen, we're going to see this on YouTube. You're not upload that.
[3:50:13.560 --> 3:50:18.840]  Uh, I'm working on that. I've got I've got people working. We've made copies. There's
[3:50:18.840 --> 3:50:24.680]  other people in the copy. I want to see this. I mean, imagine just roving bands of roid heads
[3:50:24.680 --> 3:50:29.480]  ready to taze if you don't submit. I guess the new greeting for cops is to get down and start
[3:50:29.480 --> 3:50:37.640]  licking their boots and going, Oh, Lord, Lord, King of Earth, what do you my God? Oh, my whole
[3:50:37.640 --> 3:50:42.040]  existence is to worship you. We'll take calls during the break and in the final segment with
[3:50:42.040 --> 3:50:49.640]  Kevin Booth. Get American drug war.com expose the terrorist. It is a big idea. A new world order
[3:50:50.280 --> 3:50:56.680]  in the near future. Earth is dominated by powerful government is known as the builder
[3:50:56.680 --> 3:51:03.320]  bird. Could their objective be world domination or thousands of years their dark order grew.
[3:51:03.960 --> 3:51:09.960]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[3:51:09.960 --> 3:51:18.200]  of humanity is at hand. For the first time in history, the elites plan for world government
[3:51:18.200 --> 3:51:23.560]  is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[3:51:23.560 --> 3:51:27.480]  Builders make great progress toward a world government. Most people have no idea. They're
[3:51:27.480 --> 3:51:30.840]  not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their app.

[3:51:50.440 --> 3:51:54.600]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for the American empire instead of what's fair for the
[3:51:54.600 --> 3:51:59.240]  American people. The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism, which is why you

[3:52:45.480 --> 3:52:49.240]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[3:52:49.240 --> 3:52:53.960]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor, even though we're paying record prices at the pump.
[3:52:53.960 --> 3:52:59.320]  I have run across a company called SFR, who has developed two products that improve gas mileage.
[3:52:59.320 --> 3:53:04.200]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system, protect a complete
[3:53:04.200 --> 3:53:09.960]  fuel system treatment, cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage and only one
[3:53:09.960 --> 3:53:14.840]  tank full. Protect an engine treatment not only reduces friction, but it extends the life of your
[3:53:14.840 --> 3:53:19.560]  engine. Let's face it, with the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action. Purchase a
[3:53:19.560 --> 3:53:24.520]  protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment,
[3:53:24.520 --> 3:53:31.240]  which is a $12.95 value free. Call triple-8, use SFR-1. That number again is triple-8,
[3:53:31.240 --> 3:53:38.760]  use SFR-1, or check them out online at OilCompanySecret.com. That's OilCompanySecret.com.

[3:53:52.520 --> 3:53:57.960]  And whoever's juggling the phone around, stop it. Okay, Kevin Booth, final segment. We're talking
[3:53:57.960 --> 3:54:03.000]  to David in Austin, Texas, Winkershire Lane. He pulls into his apartments. He's out there with
[3:54:03.000 --> 3:54:07.160]  his wife, and these black guys get out of a car. They block him in. He's peacefully standing there.
[3:54:07.160 --> 3:54:12.440]  They beat the daylights out of him. Probably didn't pay us cut or something. What did you
[3:54:12.440 --> 3:54:16.120]  see? We're at the end of the show. Tell me in an abbreviated fashion what happened.
[3:54:16.920 --> 3:54:21.880]  Well, another third cop showed up, African-American, and then they just all were beaten on this guy.
[3:54:21.880 --> 3:54:26.120]  They didn't ever say a word to him about what they were doing, why they were doing it, nothing.
[3:54:26.120 --> 3:54:30.040]  And then I bet they charged him with a salt. He didn't resist. He took a beating,
[3:54:30.040 --> 3:54:33.880]  and I bet he's charged with a salt. Oh, yeah. I mean, the guy, they didn't say nothing to him.
[3:54:33.880 --> 3:54:38.200]  They just approached him with their clubs, and they started nailing him. And this lady came out
[3:54:38.200 --> 3:54:43.640]  of her apartment with her video camera, and she got actually one of the cops walked up to her
[3:54:43.640 --> 3:54:50.440]  and forcefully put her back in her apartment. And then- Did he steal the camera? I don't think he
[3:54:50.440 --> 3:54:53.720]  did. Oh, you've got to go over there and get that video. See, when you see this stuff,
[3:54:53.720 --> 3:54:57.240]  you've got to get that on YouTube. Yeah, I've been trying to contact her because-
[3:54:57.800 --> 3:55:00.920]  They're getting ready for martial law, and they've told the cops to whatever you want,
[3:55:00.920 --> 3:55:05.400]  act however you want. The nation's your enemy, but either we're protecting America by getting
[3:55:05.400 --> 3:55:09.640]  tough with them, and yeah, they don't know about the real terror threat, and they're all spoiled,
[3:55:09.640 --> 3:55:16.520]  and they deserve it. And so how long did they beat this guy? It went off like 10, 15 minutes.
[3:55:16.520 --> 3:55:19.960]  I mean, just beating them. I mean, he was on the ground. He wasn't doing nothing,
[3:55:19.960 --> 3:55:23.560]  and they cuffed him. They continued to beat him. They eventually put him in the car.
[3:55:24.920 --> 3:55:29.000]  I attempted to walk over there and ask them- Well, I want to be clear about something.
[3:55:29.000 --> 3:55:33.080]  I don't want to really get off into this, but I mean, I'm not even a tough guy, and I've put
[3:55:33.720 --> 3:55:38.680]  three people in comas that started fights with me, and thank God there were always witnesses.
[3:55:38.680 --> 3:55:41.880]  A couple of times, I went to jail because when somebody's in a coma, they take you to jail,
[3:55:41.880 --> 3:55:47.000]  but I wasn't trying to crack somebody's head open and mess their brain up,
[3:55:47.000 --> 3:55:50.120]  but I mean, they kill people all the time with this, and I'm tired of it.
[3:55:50.840 --> 3:55:54.040]  Oh, yeah, definitely. I mean, this guy's definitely- I mean, the reason I probably got
[3:55:54.040 --> 3:55:57.960]  a second cop there was this guy was huge. I mean, easily this guy could probably have taken
[3:55:57.960 --> 3:56:01.080]  that one cop to jail. Well, there's something about cops when they see a big black guy. They
[3:56:01.080 --> 3:56:06.040]  just flip. It's like a little dog with a bear, and a little dog will always attack the bear.
[3:56:07.000 --> 3:56:10.840]  I actually do that. When a big guy's in front of me, I get charged up and want to open a can
[3:56:10.840 --> 3:56:16.360]  up if they're attacking me, but it's one thing to just flip out and want to go out and beat up
[3:56:16.360 --> 3:56:21.240]  people. I mean, so this just went on and on? Yeah, I mean, definitely. And like I said,
[3:56:21.240 --> 3:56:25.800]  after everything had kind of settled down, I attempted to ask the officer what had happened
[3:56:25.800 --> 3:56:29.400]  just because I felt like it's my neighborhood. I said, shut up, slave!
[3:56:30.040 --> 3:56:33.880]  Ain't got no business being down there. I had no right to know, and I need to get back in my
[3:56:33.880 --> 3:56:39.880]  apartment or go wherever I need to be and get away from there. And I mean, all of that started
[3:56:39.880 --> 3:56:43.320]  with a big fuss. I had my kids there, and I'm not about to get whooped in front of my kids.
[3:56:43.320 --> 3:56:47.480]  Oh, you kidding? They'll kill you these days. And by the way, Austin cops aren't even the worst,
[3:56:47.480 --> 3:56:51.000]  but they kill people every few weeks over there. It's kind of like the hunting ground.
[3:56:51.000 --> 3:56:56.920]  Well, you ought to write that up and post it on Craigslist. Everybody can see it. I'm going to
[3:56:56.920 --> 3:57:03.000]  actually have the guy's girlfriend call you as soon as she gets the understanding of the
[3:57:03.000 --> 3:57:06.600]  charges and stuff. I've been talking to her and I told her that she needs to get it.
[3:57:06.600 --> 3:57:10.920]  Does she have any idea why they did this or was it just like a pleasure thing?
[3:57:10.920 --> 3:57:15.000]  Like right now, as far as trying to get any information on what's going on and how to
[3:57:15.000 --> 3:57:19.160]  get them out and all that, she can't get any information. You know, she tried to get a lawyer
[3:57:19.160 --> 3:57:23.720]  and I don't know what's going on with her lawyer. This country is so gone. Okay. Hey, thank you.
[3:57:23.720 --> 3:57:28.440]  Send me info. Kevin, I could take hundreds of calls and then I could get hundreds of videos
[3:57:28.440 --> 3:57:32.440]  every day on YouTube. I mean, where people are tied down being tasered and the cops are going,
[3:57:33.880 --> 3:57:37.160]  I mean, I don't understand how we got all these psychos running things.
[3:57:37.160 --> 3:57:41.240]  Yeah. I mean, and I just found out another, another person that was in the drug war film
[3:57:41.240 --> 3:57:46.120]  at Joe Moore, the big black hog farmer that, that they accused of being the big,
[3:57:46.120 --> 3:57:51.160]  the big drug King 10. He spent four years in jail. He was in talking about Kevin,
[3:57:51.160 --> 3:57:54.840]  let's go into overdrive. I got to go to a meeting, but we'll do, we'll do 10 minutes
[3:57:54.840 --> 3:57:58.920]  of overdrive. Can you stay with us, Kevin? Okay. Okay. Genesis listeners, Steve and Will,
