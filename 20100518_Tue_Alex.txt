[00:00.000 --> 00:11.400]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.400 --> 00:18.960]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.960 --> 00:37.520]  Texas Alex Jones it is Tuesday the 18th day of May 2010 we're gonna be live
[00:37.520 --> 00:45.880]  here for the next four hours Dr. Edwin Vieira is joining us coming up in the
[00:45.880 --> 00:51.720]  last hour of the broadcast today to discuss the massive states rights
[00:51.720 --> 01:00.200]  movement against tyranny and how we take this nation back we have Margaret
[01:00.200 --> 01:04.800]  Roberts joining us for about 20 minutes in the second half of the third hour
[01:04.800 --> 01:11.560]  key Oklahoma bombing witness denied access to attorneys we received this
[01:11.560 --> 01:16.720]  email from the prison yesterday right before they cut off his contact from
[01:16.720 --> 01:20.800]  David Hammer the death row inmate who authored two books in the Oklahoma City
[01:20.800 --> 01:25.320]  bombing was locked down by prison officials following his interview with
[01:25.320 --> 01:30.920]  this radio broadcast last week I don't see the problem he did one two weeks
[01:30.920 --> 01:38.480]  before that but they are very upset about that and he does say that he fears
[01:38.480 --> 01:42.440]  for his life they came to his jail cell Sunday night and said we're taking you
[01:42.440 --> 01:47.440]  for a medical exam the middle of the night and he declined that because it
[01:47.440 --> 01:52.240]  wasn't part of his scheduled medical exam it's one of the few things people
[01:52.240 --> 01:56.000]  actually have power over ends some of the prison systems that actually follow
[01:56.000 --> 02:01.160]  federal laws they're able to control what type of health care they get because
[02:01.160 --> 02:05.360]  that is a decision you make over your body but we'll break that down coming
[02:05.360 --> 02:09.140]  up in about two and a half hours we're gonna get into what's happening in the
[02:09.140 --> 02:14.360]  markets worldwide we're gonna break down the election primaries going on
[02:14.360 --> 02:19.080]  around the country staggered in different states we've seen neocon
[02:19.080 --> 02:24.440]  Republicans in Utah falling we've seen Democrat incumbents in deep trouble
[02:24.440 --> 02:30.960]  specters in deep trouble and the headline up on prisonplanet.com
[02:30.960 --> 02:41.840]  written by Curt Nemo will neocons steal Senate primary from Rand Paul Paul's
[02:41.840 --> 02:46.400]  opponent who is Kentucky's chief elections official that's illegal all
[02:46.400 --> 02:49.800]  over the country but the election commission run by him said it was okay
[02:49.800 --> 02:55.640]  suspiciously confident despite 18-point deficit he says he's gonna win even
[02:55.640 --> 03:01.480]  though the polls show between 22 and 18 percent the lowest polls show Rand Paul
[03:01.480 --> 03:05.680]  with a 15-point lead and this is gonna be a major bellwether because he was
[03:05.680 --> 03:13.000]  anti-Iraq war anti-patriot act 100% pro-second amendment and this shows that
[03:13.000 --> 03:18.680]  the Tea Parties really are libertarian and constitutionalist not Republican
[03:18.680 --> 03:24.760]  hacks and from and Dick Cheney and all the big neocons have lined up against
[03:24.760 --> 03:28.640]  Rand Paul I've ignored it in the last week because I don't want to give any
[03:28.640 --> 03:32.680]  attention to it but it's too late for them now they've been running TV ads
[03:32.680 --> 03:39.520]  attacking Rand Paul in Kentucky for coming on this radio show and they take
[03:39.520 --> 03:45.960]  selective cuts of me you know when I'm illustrating something I was watching
[03:45.960 --> 03:49.360]  YouTube clips of Rush Limbaugh last night you know he he acts goofy sometimes
[03:49.360 --> 03:53.440]  too I mean we're radio host where we illustrate things and they took clips of
[03:53.440 --> 03:58.760]  that and cut it in to Rand Paul on this radio show but that's gonna fail but the
[03:58.760 --> 04:05.440]  larger issue here is if he wins and we're seeing Republican incumbents being
[04:05.440 --> 04:09.680]  thrown out everywhere not just Democrats but if he wins that signs the
[04:09.680 --> 04:17.440]  death knell for the neocons coming up in the next few elections so not only are
[04:17.440 --> 04:22.200]  the Obamanoids gonna be thrown out but the Republican hacks that launch illegal
[04:22.200 --> 04:26.200]  wars destroy the bill of rights beef up homeland security against the American
[04:26.200 --> 04:31.320]  people that was going on under Bush not just Obama they're in deep trouble you
[04:31.320 --> 04:35.720]  know the same Republicans that tripled the size of government I know Obama even
[04:35.720 --> 04:40.440]  went further in one year I didn't think it was possible yes he's bad the worst
[04:40.440 --> 04:45.040]  ever but Bush was the worst ever then Obama was the worst ever and you can be
[04:45.040 --> 04:49.000]  assured of a neocon Republican gets in in three years he'll be the worst ever
[04:49.000 --> 04:53.320]  she'll be the worst ever it's all bait and switches so a major political
[04:53.320 --> 04:57.640]  realignment going on towards the Constitution towards Liberty this is
[04:57.640 --> 05:01.160]  exciting we'll break that down as well stay with us
[05:03.800 --> 05:09.880]  tyranny is here the grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality it really

[07:58.560 --> 08:08.600]  today ease the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the GCN radio network
[08:08.720 --> 08:12.320]  all right here's what I want to do today we've got some guests coming up the
[08:12.320 --> 08:17.000]  last hour and a half of transmission but in the meantime I want to open the
[08:17.000 --> 08:25.440]  phones up on some specific issues yesterday we posted a video in an
[08:25.440 --> 08:33.200]  article by Stuart Rhodes the founder of Oathkeepers of a army sergeant who was
[08:33.200 --> 08:41.920]  in Louisiana for Katrina and we have ABC news we have CBS news we have the
[08:41.920 --> 08:51.040]  local news there's more than 20 newscast out there where the mayor and the
[08:51.040 --> 08:54.480]  police chief said and the Fed said no one will be armed everyone will be
[08:54.480 --> 08:58.920]  disarmed and they went into New Orleans and surrounding areas mainly the
[08:58.920 --> 09:02.680]  wealthy areas and put people in handcuffs and went in their houses and busted
[09:02.680 --> 09:06.440]  open their gun safes and stole their guns and almost no one got them back they
[09:06.440 --> 09:09.520]  didn't tag them they took them and then we talked about it and there was
[09:09.520 --> 09:13.800]  mainstream media denial and the New York Times and other publications saying
[09:13.800 --> 09:19.000]  the conspiracy cooks think they're taking guns now that's a Psyop again they
[09:19.000 --> 09:22.120]  come take your guns and then say we didn't take your guns and it was a
[09:22.120 --> 09:30.080]  federal laboratory test but in this video this sergeant talks about how the
[09:30.080 --> 09:35.440]  majority of the units first in the small town they were in and then when
[09:35.440 --> 09:41.520]  they were sent to New Orleans refused to take part in it so basically their
[09:41.520 --> 09:45.960]  officers backed off and then didn't request it of the National Guard units
[09:45.960 --> 09:53.640]  but the big army as it's called regular army including special forces did go out
[09:53.640 --> 09:58.560]  and confiscate firearms and this is important four or five years later
[09:58.560 --> 10:02.960]  because now the military is training the National Guard for gun
[10:02.960 --> 10:07.360]  confiscation in mass and that has even been in mainstream news publications and
[10:07.360 --> 10:11.960]  we covered that in great depth in my film police state for the rise of FEMA so
[10:11.960 --> 10:17.040]  what I want to do at least in the first bank or two of phone calls then we'll
[10:17.040 --> 10:23.160]  just open up the phones to everybody in the next hour is give military men and
[10:23.160 --> 10:29.480]  women a chance to call in to back up this report that the military did refuse
[10:29.480 --> 10:36.000]  according to this report around half of the units and people in formation
[10:36.000 --> 10:41.000]  non-commissioned officers sergeants and others stood up and said we're not going
[10:41.000 --> 10:43.560]  to take part in this we're not going to go along with it and I noticed in the
[10:43.560 --> 10:47.400]  YouTube video yesterday last night this morning I was checking the YouTube
[10:47.400 --> 10:52.720]  video with the interview that Stuart Rhodes did with this sergeant from the
[10:52.720 --> 10:58.880]  Utah National Guard it was there in Katrina I noticed that there was comment
[10:58.880 --> 11:04.320]  after comment of people saying they were there and that they refused and that
[11:04.320 --> 11:08.600]  they saw the regular army confiscating guns and I saw regular army people
[11:08.600 --> 11:13.480]  saying I was there and I refused and I went to their channels and went through
[11:13.480 --> 11:17.840]  their videos and a lot of them did have military footage on there from Iraq
[11:17.840 --> 11:22.520]  and other places so it appeared that it was military people but regardless we
[11:22.520 --> 11:25.720]  know the gun confiscation went on we know they're training them for it the
[11:25.720 --> 11:31.480]  issue is the question is did you take part in gun confiscation or did you say
[11:31.480 --> 11:36.880]  no or did you talk to people in other units who took part in it or said no the
[11:36.880 --> 11:42.000]  phones are open specifically right now then I'm gonna cover news and go to your
[11:42.000 --> 11:48.040]  calls they're open right now specifically for people that have intel and
[11:48.040 --> 11:54.040]  information on this because this is uplifting information this is buoying
[11:54.040 --> 12:03.280]  information this is good news and we need to expand on this and I get more of
[12:03.280 --> 12:07.720]  this on record because we know a lot of people who are currently serving in our
[12:07.720 --> 12:12.360]  military are listening to the broadcast and are very upset about the type of
[12:12.360 --> 12:17.760]  training they're being given right now so the toll-free number to join us today
[12:17.760 --> 12:29.960]  is 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 or if your husband is in Afghanistan right
[12:29.960 --> 12:34.600]  now or Iraq or in the other hundred plus countries our troops are in but if
[12:34.600 --> 12:40.880]  your husband told you about this if you're the wife or the husband of troops
[12:40.880 --> 12:46.560]  that are serving who have relayed this message to you you're also welcome to
[12:46.560 --> 12:57.360]  call in on this specific issue because this is so important 1-800-259-9231 and
[12:57.360 --> 13:00.720]  we'll get you up and on the air and separately if you're in the military
[13:00.720 --> 13:06.000]  and concerned about being trained for gun confiscation you're also welcome to
[13:06.000 --> 13:14.800]  call in again at 800-259-9231 okay let me just start going through the news here
[13:14.800 --> 13:23.360]  as as quickly as I can because there is there is a lot of it here's the info
[13:23.360 --> 13:28.440]  wars dot com article despite poll numbers Rand Paul's opponent confident he
[13:28.440 --> 13:32.520]  will win in Kentucky and that's the headline that Kurt Nemo gave the
[13:32.520 --> 13:36.760]  excellent story he wrote this morning an info wars dot com I posted it at
[13:36.760 --> 13:42.520]  prisonplanet.com this morning or had it posted by Watson with this headline
[13:42.520 --> 13:49.880]  will neocons steal Senate primary from Rand Paul now I've had Judge Andrew
[13:49.880 --> 13:54.240]  Napolitano on former federal judge on this subject I've had Ron Paul on on this
[13:54.240 --> 13:59.120]  subject and they both agreed that in most states like New Jersey were Napolitano
[13:59.120 --> 14:06.520]  practice law it is on the books it's illegal for someone to run for a
[14:06.520 --> 14:12.720]  political office and to be the head of the elections whether it's in the county
[14:12.720 --> 14:18.680]  the city or the state you can be say in the state Senate and run for the US
[14:18.680 --> 14:26.320]  House or you can be a mayor and run for the state legislature that that's not a
[14:26.320 --> 14:30.400]  problem I mean most people that end up running for higher office are already in
[14:30.400 --> 14:37.080]  office or have already served in office but you can't be over the election and
[14:37.080 --> 14:46.040]  then control the election that you're running in guaranteed this individual has
[14:46.040 --> 14:49.720]  got all of his minions in place around the state and they know they're going to
[14:49.720 --> 14:56.560]  be getting jobs in the US Senate if he gets in now depending on the poll he's
[14:56.560 --> 15:04.000]  between 22% and 15% against his competition that's Rand Paul and a lot
[15:04.000 --> 15:08.320]  of you are saying well I'm not in Kentucky why do I care well Politico the
[15:08.320 --> 15:13.000]  New York Times the Washington Post the cover of the New York Times yesterday
[15:13.000 --> 15:17.840]  by the way and Wall Street Journal you name it are all pointing out that if
[15:17.840 --> 15:25.080]  Rand Paul wins in Kentucky today that seals the deal shows a clear realignment
[15:25.080 --> 15:29.640]  just like you saw the Republican incumbent in the Republican primary for
[15:29.640 --> 15:35.600]  the Senate in Utah lose because he's an open borders big government pimp and a
[15:35.600 --> 15:43.360]  patriot comparatively not perfect but a patriot trounced him and is now going
[15:43.360 --> 15:48.000]  to trounce the Democratic candidate the polls show in Utah a specter who is a
[15:48.000 --> 15:52.200]  Democrat is going to be thrown out probably today unless there's election
[15:52.200 --> 15:58.240]  rigging in his state all the polls show he's at least 10 points behind the most
[15:58.240 --> 16:04.880]  scientific polls in Kentucky show that Rand Paul is 18 points ahead three
[16:04.880 --> 16:13.640]  separate polls show him 18 points ahead one shows 22 several 15 16 and 17 but 18
[16:13.640 --> 16:18.480]  looks like the number here when you study polling science and in reputable
[16:18.480 --> 16:22.440]  polls when you get multiple polls coming in with the same number with a
[16:22.440 --> 16:26.760]  margin of error depending on the poll of three to seven percent and you've got
[16:26.760 --> 16:32.840]  seven percent that are undecided any way you slice it any way you slice it
[16:32.840 --> 16:39.320]  even if you take the margin of error and give it all to the neocon candidate
[16:39.320 --> 16:45.920]  even if you give all the undecided to him Rand Paul still wins heartily
[16:45.920 --> 16:53.400]  heartily by four points so there you have it and they went to the elections
[16:53.400 --> 16:57.440]  Commission they went to the ethics Commission the Rand Paul campaign they
[16:57.440 --> 17:04.160]  tried to block this they said that he needs to recuse himself from overseeing
[17:04.160 --> 17:09.320]  the elections at least for the duration of the campaign you know he can go back
[17:09.320 --> 17:17.120]  to being the election head you know if he loses but no the Commission and I've
[17:17.120 --> 17:20.200]  looked this up and Ron Paul and the politics I don't agree this is a
[17:20.200 --> 17:24.680]  precedent-setting case there has never been a case where an ethics Commission
[17:24.680 --> 17:30.040]  has said that something like this is okay I mean this is this is ridiculous
[17:30.040 --> 17:33.920]  it's like having Goldman Sachs former executives in every regulatory Commission
[17:33.920 --> 17:39.280]  over Goldman Sachs bailout money or or having Henry Paulson when he was
[17:39.280 --> 17:43.840]  Treasury head giving himself a waiver for what two hundred and twelve million
[17:43.840 --> 17:51.040]  dollars of payments to himself and he gave himself the waiver you can't give
[17:51.040 --> 17:55.760]  yourself a waiver it when you're the Treasury head giving tens of billions of
[17:55.760 --> 17:59.160]  dollars in one payment to Goldman Sachs and then you get over two hundred a
[17:59.160 --> 18:04.160]  million dollars you can't do that I like it to a bank manager can't give
[18:04.160 --> 18:07.880]  himself a note saying he's allowed to come to the bank at midnight and load a
[18:07.880 --> 18:12.360]  van full of all the cash and safety deposit box money just because you give
[18:12.360 --> 18:16.360]  yourself a waiver to do it I mean kind of cop you know can kind of police
[18:16.360 --> 18:20.480]  captain give himself a waiver to sell cocaine on street corners no they can't
[18:20.480 --> 18:26.240]  I mean can anybody can a doctor give himself a waiver to give himself you
[18:26.240 --> 18:29.960]  know 50 oxy cottons a day you know a lot of a lot of doctors have gone to jail
[18:29.960 --> 18:34.760]  for that so you can't do this because you're in a position of authority it
[18:34.760 --> 18:41.360]  says again here's the headline will neocon steel Senate primary from Rand
[18:41.360 --> 18:47.360]  Paul I don't think they can be this bold when they're 18 points behind I don't
[18:47.360 --> 18:52.000]  think they can be this bold and you know even if the election official isn't bad
[18:52.000 --> 18:56.620]  try Grayson even if he is a good guy and he may be though he's been playing some
[18:56.620 --> 19:01.480]  dirty tricks and has been supported by Goldman Sachs and have been some big
[19:01.480 --> 19:06.240]  supporter of AIG and but let's just say even if he's a good guy what about the
[19:06.240 --> 19:10.560]  people under him that are over the elections that stand to get jobs when
[19:10.560 --> 19:17.600]  he goes to the US Senate so if Rand Paul loses today there is no doubt it was
[19:17.600 --> 19:22.400]  stolen and what have you seen in Florida and Ohio and other places both parties
[19:22.400 --> 19:27.000]  do this and party people do this to their own party this stinks to high heaven
[19:27.000 --> 19:31.440]  effect here's my comment on the article it says Alex Jones comment with the most
[19:31.440 --> 19:35.320]  recent polls showing Trey Grayson trailing Rand Paul by a gargantuan 18
[19:35.320 --> 19:39.440]  points we should view his overconfidence with extreme suspicion especially
[19:39.440 --> 19:43.280]  considering the fact that Grayson is a neocon operative and also Kentucky's
[19:43.280 --> 19:47.720]  chief elections official Grayson is possibly just playing mind games but if
[19:47.720 --> 19:51.880]  he is somehow able to overturn the 18-point deficit serious questions will
[19:51.880 --> 19:56.280]  be asked about the integrity of this election and the article goes through it
[19:56.280 --> 20:01.240]  in great detail okay I'm gonna shift gears and other news straight ahead fact

[24:55.560 --> 25:00.120]  inspections to keep children safe see this is now happening in England and the
[25:00.120 --> 25:10.280]  US and you just get your CPS visit no probable cause no nothing and that ties
[25:10.280 --> 25:14.040]  in to this news of that of course we reported more than a decade ago starting
[25:14.040 --> 25:19.080]  in England now coming to the US new recycle bins with tracking chips coming
[25:19.080 --> 25:23.200]  to Alexandria and then they're going to start finding you after they phase this
[25:23.200 --> 25:30.480]  in if you don't recycle everything and then spy on what you're doing just
[25:30.480 --> 25:35.520]  setting up this total surveillance grid and that ties together with parents of
[25:35.520 --> 25:40.840]  under fives face nanny state home inspections to keep children safe time
[25:40.840 --> 25:46.720]  magazine reporting male birth control stopping sperm with ultrasound and of
[25:46.720 --> 25:50.160]  course all the studies show ultrasound is bad for your baby that's why they
[25:50.160 --> 25:56.560]  don't do it in the first trimester but just incredible so we're going to be
[25:56.560 --> 26:03.840]  going over that as well Australian wiki leak founder passport confiscated at the
[26:03.840 --> 26:10.080]  airport because he of course exposed the hit list the blacklist system they're
[26:10.080 --> 26:14.800]  going to be using to block out alternative news information in
[26:14.800 --> 26:22.680]  Australia Obama snubs questions at press freedom act signing yeah they have
[26:22.680 --> 26:31.240]  privacy of events you know where they claim that the government is going to
[26:31.240 --> 26:36.480]  give the public more privacy and not spy on us and that they're going to be
[26:36.480 --> 26:39.520]  more transparent the government's gonna be more transparent and they do the
[26:39.520 --> 26:42.720]  exact opposite and either don't let the press center don't answer their
[26:42.720 --> 26:46.240]  questions Obama now approval ready continue to fall so he's basically
[26:46.240 --> 26:55.360]  hiding out from the media but before we go to break and come back with your
[26:55.360 --> 27:02.880]  phone calls today I wanted to give people some good news Gary Franchi
[27:02.880 --> 27:07.440]  yesterday was on the radio show the producer of don't try it on me rise the
[27:07.440 --> 27:16.680]  Republic and he basically we had the idea and I've been pushing them with
[27:16.680 --> 27:20.080]  camp FEMA their last great film to just go ahead and allow people to make
[27:20.080 --> 27:23.960]  copies of it so we can have a bigger viral effect of these great films I
[27:23.960 --> 27:29.840]  also consulted on an appearance and so they've done that with camp FEMA and
[27:29.840 --> 27:35.960]  now out of the gates they're going to do that with don't tread on me rise of the
[27:35.960 --> 27:41.760]  Republic and it's going to premiere coming up later this evening at
[27:41.760 --> 27:47.320]  prisonplanet.tv for prisonplanet.tv members and then it will be
[27:47.320 --> 27:51.320]  dispersed to the four wins but to see it in the highest quality online prison
[27:51.320 --> 27:56.560]  planet.tv today but it is important to support the filmmakers ladies and
[27:56.560 --> 27:59.280]  gentlemen they won't be able to make great films like this in the future plus
[27:59.280 --> 28:04.400]  to have it on DVD and to have the expanded extras in the highest quality so I
[28:04.400 --> 28:09.800]  would seriously hope that everyone would go to infowars.com or call toll free
[28:09.800 --> 28:18.520]  888-253-3139 and to secure a copy of don't tread on me and police state for
[28:18.520 --> 28:22.560]  the rise of FEMA and of course invisible empire new order defined because the
[28:22.560 --> 28:33.920]  public is now ready to be awakened plus alternative media needs support we don't
[28:33.920 --> 28:36.440]  have the Ford Foundation funding us we don't have the federal government
[28:36.440 --> 28:41.280]  funding us you are funding us and we're having a big effect and films are the
[28:41.280 --> 28:46.200]  most effective tool I've seen bar none to not talk yourself blue in the face but
[28:46.200 --> 28:49.600]  give somebody a well-produced well-documented film like in-game or
[28:49.600 --> 28:53.800]  terror storm or don't tread on me or invisible empire or the Obama deception
[28:53.800 --> 28:58.040]  or fall the republic and if they shut the internet down or start censoring it
[28:58.040 --> 29:01.400]  and controlling what can be out there is they're openly pushing for worldwide
[29:01.400 --> 29:04.240]  and starting to phase in here in the US they're still not going to be able to
[29:04.240 --> 29:08.680]  stop you from putting up flyers with simple messages in your town then the
[29:08.680 --> 29:11.640]  government will try to suppress your free speech then the public will start
[29:11.640 --> 29:15.880]  rebelling as we saw with the Obama poster contest being in hundreds of
[29:15.880 --> 29:20.240]  newspapers and hundreds of TV stations worldwide becoming a phenomenon because
[29:20.240 --> 29:25.800]  they tried to censor it so films in on DVD cannot be stopped ladies and

[33:22.280 --> 33:29.080]  welcome ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us big news blitz coming up
[33:29.080 --> 33:33.480]  in the next hour literally got about a hundred important stories here we're
[33:33.480 --> 33:38.320]  gonna attempt to tackle but I want to go to your phone calls right now if you
[33:38.320 --> 33:42.680]  just joined us at the start of the broadcast I talked about a video up on
[33:42.680 --> 33:46.560]  infowars.com an article written by Stuart Rhodes the founder of Oath Keepers
[33:46.560 --> 33:52.280]  that's simply getting the military to reread their oath and to swear to it again
[33:52.280 --> 33:55.800]  that they won't confiscate guns they won't put Americans in FEMA camps they
[33:55.800 --> 34:00.320]  won't carry out martial law all of which they're being trained for and if we
[34:00.320 --> 34:04.520]  reach out to the military and police and get them to uphold their oath and
[34:04.520 --> 34:10.200]  understand their true mission then they will be American patriots in history and
[34:10.200 --> 34:14.520]  and not use like the German military was or the Russian military was used or
[34:14.520 --> 34:19.280]  many other militaries to carry out oppression and there's no doubt the
[34:19.280 --> 34:22.520]  government's calling for censorship for secret arrest of citizens they're
[34:22.520 --> 34:27.560]  trying to pass legislation they're trying to create a list where anybody the
[34:27.560 --> 34:31.280]  federal government once can be put on the no-gun buy list we know in the
[34:31.280 --> 34:33.920]  internal documents that most the training is to target conservatives
[34:33.920 --> 34:40.640]  libertarians returning veterans gun owners this is real and to have the this
[34:40.640 --> 34:48.120]  interview with a sergeant who was in the National Guard from Utah who was in
[34:48.120 --> 34:54.120]  Katrina and to talk about how as much as half of the troops refused to take
[34:54.120 --> 34:59.280]  part in the gun confiscation and even spoke out information and their officers
[34:59.280 --> 35:04.160]  were concerned and you know didn't want to go along with it and didn't and so
[35:04.160 --> 35:07.760]  yes they were able to get some regular army to engage in gun confiscation with
[35:07.760 --> 35:11.560]  the police they were able to show that on ABC News and CBS News like it was a
[35:11.560 --> 35:16.680]  good thing to condition and acclimate the public to accept this so I wanted to
[35:16.680 --> 35:21.120]  open the phones up specifically next hour it'll be wide open to everybody for
[35:21.120 --> 35:25.280]  former military that were part of Katrina or military that talked to people
[35:25.280 --> 35:28.120]  that were part of the gun confiscation but we know the gun confiscation
[35:28.120 --> 35:34.480]  happened that's on record the issue is people that specifically were witnesses
[35:34.480 --> 35:39.720]  to or talked to other military who were witnesses to the military saying no to
[35:39.720 --> 35:45.800]  that beta test in Katrina so we're gonna go to the phones right now I'm gonna
[35:45.800 --> 35:50.280]  talk to Ernie and then Steve Jim and others the toll-free number to join us
[35:50.280 --> 35:57.840]  is 800 259 9231 and let's go ahead and go to Ernie in California for our
[35:57.840 --> 36:02.520]  military you're on the air go ahead okay hey Alex thanks a lot yeah hey my kid
[36:02.520 --> 36:08.080]  was in she's just got out and it's going back in okay has talked a lot of
[36:08.080 --> 36:11.720]  military and they basically a lot of them do understand and will not take the
[36:11.720 --> 36:15.760]  weapons the people they're worried about is the foreign soldiers on our soil and
[36:15.760 --> 36:20.600]  the hardened bad and battle troops which are mostly drugged up but the other
[36:20.600 --> 36:26.640]  thing that scares me is finding out my kid has never been to Iraq or Iran now
[36:26.640 --> 36:32.200]  she's having flashbacks I have pictures of her there she said she's never there
[36:32.200 --> 36:37.080]  this is the part of the military it scares me what they did to my kid has no
[36:37.080 --> 36:41.880]  regulation the regulation at all what happened and now having dreams of being
[36:41.880 --> 36:45.920]  a sniper having pictures of her friends showing her there this is what I'm scared
[36:45.920 --> 36:49.960]  of and I got to let it go because it's really upsetting me well Ernie I
[36:49.960 --> 36:55.680]  appreciate your call you know what strange is I've a wired magazine article
[36:55.680 --> 36:59.920]  it's got to be from eight nine years ago and I've seen other recent
[36:59.920 --> 37:06.720]  publications report that they are giving amnesic drugs in quote test to
[37:06.720 --> 37:16.000]  units in Afghanistan and Iraq and that they're having record post traumatic
[37:16.000 --> 37:20.920]  stress disorders they're having record suicides and just saw the headline two
[37:20.920 --> 37:25.960]  days ago the majority of troops in military hospitals now are there for
[37:25.960 --> 37:31.520]  mental illness well yeah they're serving two three four five six tours no
[37:31.520 --> 37:36.520]  military has ever made their troops do that in modern history and so it's
[37:36.520 --> 37:41.320]  really screwing them up these type of high stress situations I mean how many
[37:41.320 --> 37:46.920]  of you have caught a burglar in your house and had them assault you and you
[37:46.920 --> 37:50.960]  have nightmares about it and flashbacks how many of you have ever been mugged and
[37:50.960 --> 37:54.120]  hit over the head and you have nightmares and flashbacks how many of you
[37:54.120 --> 37:59.920]  have ever been assaulted and had nightmares and flashbacks about it I
[37:59.920 --> 38:03.000]  mean how many of you have been in a really bad car wreck and had nightmares
[38:03.000 --> 38:05.880]  and flashbacks about it and then you know it takes you a few months and you
[38:05.880 --> 38:08.680]  get over it but you're still scared when somebody else is driving and they're
[38:08.680 --> 38:13.360]  driving fast well imagine having thousands of experiences like that
[38:13.360 --> 38:18.200]  that's basically what the military goes through I mean into the SWAT teams go
[38:18.200 --> 38:24.920]  through it you know kicking down hundreds and hundreds of doors in a SWAT
[38:24.920 --> 38:31.040]  teams career it is very traumatic you know who really goes through traumatic
[38:31.040 --> 38:39.440]  stress is emergency room doctors and nurses I mean they're seeing people die
[38:39.440 --> 38:44.040]  in big hospitals every week they're seeing children die I've talked to
[38:44.040 --> 38:47.640]  several people that work in my office that just so happened to be former
[38:47.640 --> 38:54.240]  EMTs and both of the people in my office who were you know ambulance
[38:54.240 --> 39:03.960]  technicians they quit because of seeing dead children I think one guy said he
[39:03.960 --> 39:07.280]  was like six seven years he worked as an EMT one of the other fellas three years
[39:07.280 --> 39:12.040]  and when you go into an apartment and there's a two-year-old dead who ate a
[39:12.040 --> 39:14.920]  bunch of cocaine off the table and they're bright blue and you can't
[39:14.920 --> 39:19.080]  resuscitate them I mean that is stressful that's post traumatic stress
[39:19.080 --> 39:22.920]  disorder and that's why police drink and use drugs more than the other
[39:22.920 --> 39:27.200]  profession that's why the troops do that because it's hard ladies and gentlemen
[39:27.200 --> 39:33.480]  I mean I've not gone through you know one one hundredth of what people in the
[39:33.480 --> 39:38.800]  military have but I grew up in Dallas I was probably in I don't know 70 80 I
[39:38.800 --> 39:46.520]  haven't counted it up knock down drag out you know really bad fights and one
[39:46.520 --> 39:51.600]  time I was at a party and this was I was about 14 and go back to your calls in
[39:51.600 --> 39:57.040]  a moment I'm going off the deep end here telling stories but I was 14 I was at a
[39:57.040 --> 40:00.600]  college party in a my neighborhood because I had some friends that were in
[40:00.600 --> 40:06.040]  college and this girl was talking to me and then this preppy guy came over and
[40:06.040 --> 40:08.440]  said I'm gonna kick your butt if you talk to her that's my ex-girlfriend
[40:08.440 --> 40:11.920]  and I didn't even start a fight I said okay man whatever you know but I was
[40:11.920 --> 40:16.480]  kind of smart man so you're a tough guy I went into the kitchen to get beer out
[40:16.480 --> 40:23.040]  of the refrigerator and he came in behind me with a butcher knife and slammed it
[40:23.040 --> 40:30.420]  up against my throat and was basically foaming at the mouth you had me in a
[40:30.420 --> 40:34.480]  headlock saying I'll kill you I want to slit your throat he was doing it so hard
[40:34.480 --> 40:39.720]  that it put cuts on my neck and I was bleeding and I got very calm you know at
[40:39.720 --> 40:42.440]  a primitive level I knew this guy's gonna freak out and slip my throat if I
[40:42.440 --> 40:46.480]  spaz out and I said you're the boss you're right I apologize and he let me
[40:46.480 --> 40:54.240]  go and I left now few weeks later a month later whatever it was he was at
[40:54.240 --> 41:00.400]  another party and stabbed a guy in the heart and the guy almost died the guy
[41:00.400 --> 41:05.760]  went to prison for it but I mean that's an example and I still every six months
[41:05.760 --> 41:12.520]  or so have a nightmare of that happening a flashback and I and I wake up now
[41:12.520 --> 41:19.760]  that was one event can you imagine the military with hundreds of events I mean
[41:19.760 --> 41:23.840]  if you go serve a tour in a combat zone you're probably gonna have every day
[41:23.840 --> 41:28.880]  bad events traumatic events and maybe once a week have an event you know on
[41:28.880 --> 41:33.960]  the Richter scale similar to what I just talked about or worse can you imagine
[41:33.960 --> 41:37.760]  and some of them turn into psychopaths and like it but most of them don't and
[41:37.760 --> 41:41.280]  I mean it's a serious situation but I said I'm going to your calls I
[41:41.280 --> 41:45.560]  apologize I'm all I'm all over the map here let's go to Ron in Texas whose
[41:45.560 --> 41:53.280]  military Ron go ahead Alex how you doing pretty good sir well I want to first
[41:53.280 --> 41:57.840]  thank you for bringing out that point of PTSD with the soldiers because I've done
[41:57.840 --> 42:02.680]  two tours in Iraq before I was mentally retired and that is a very common
[42:02.680 --> 42:09.800]  problem with them in reference to your call list I was with the first Calvary
[42:09.800 --> 42:14.800]  Division when we deployed for Operation Southern Belt which was to go in after
[42:14.800 --> 42:25.400]  Katrina I was with the 1-5 Cav battalion now when we were there we were
[42:25.400 --> 42:32.840]  stationed in the area of Algiers commonly referred to Mardi Gras city
[42:32.840 --> 42:37.560]  because that's where they store all the Mardi Gras floats everything
[42:37.560 --> 42:44.960]  that was our area of operations we didn't conduct any weapons seizures for
[42:44.960 --> 42:50.560]  many of the individuals there although we did ask if they had we were not
[42:50.560 --> 42:57.520]  ordered by our higher command to do any such features there were families who
[42:57.520 --> 43:01.960]  said that there were army units that were there but from my understanding
[43:01.960 --> 43:07.120]  between us at first cab and those of us that were with the 82nd Airborne who
[43:07.120 --> 43:12.080]  was also there none of us that I can recall were even ordered to do that
[43:12.080 --> 43:16.540]  well I mean certainly you've seen the mainstream TV reports where it shows the
[43:16.540 --> 43:21.600]  troops with police but watching confiscating guns but watching those
[43:21.600 --> 43:27.040]  videos carefully it's the military backing up the police while they went
[43:27.040 --> 43:33.960]  into homes and took the firearms so have you seen those videos yes sir I
[43:33.960 --> 43:40.840]  actually have and those videos actually were what was going on before we
[43:40.840 --> 43:46.480]  arrived we arrived probably about a week or two after most of that it happened well
[43:46.480 --> 43:51.000]  the word I get is the feds tried to order the guard and big army as it's
[43:51.000 --> 43:55.840]  called for those that don't know regular army to do it and basically most of them
[43:55.840 --> 44:00.760]  said no and they just did some beta test with the military led by the FBI and
[44:00.760 --> 44:05.080]  local police and FEMA and they did do gun confiscation it was mainly police
[44:05.080 --> 44:09.080]  stopping cars of people leaving or coming in taking guns stopping boats
[44:09.080 --> 44:13.080]  coming in with people that had guns obviously to protect their property but
[44:13.080 --> 44:18.600]  I mean was there a larger debate going on with the troops because that's the
[44:18.600 --> 44:21.960]  word we've gotten and that's also in this oath keepers report was that the
[44:21.960 --> 44:26.040]  troops basically openly said we're not going to be part of this
[44:26.040 --> 44:32.520]  amongst out and I'll just be for my unit so as far as we were concerned that was
[44:32.520 --> 44:37.040]  not a priority to us because we felt that the individuals who were still there
[44:37.040 --> 44:43.840]  in their homes occupying it needed some sort of security because there was and
[44:43.840 --> 44:47.560]  I'm going to call them the alphabet agencies you know you know what I'm
[44:47.560 --> 44:51.840]  referring to they were going in there doing operations seizing weapons
[44:51.840 --> 44:58.520]  supposedly going in ratings so-called drug houses and stuff like that we even
[44:58.520 --> 45:05.240]  walked by on a patrol that we were conducting a natural DEA operation we
[45:05.240 --> 45:09.640]  saw the guy shooting up and going into a house and we got about two blocks down
[45:09.640 --> 45:13.400]  they start throwing the flashbangs and going in we heard a couple of shots
[45:13.400 --> 45:19.120]  fired next thing we know we're hearing on our radio to avoid that area it was
[45:19.120 --> 45:23.520]  locked down well yeah for the cover-up well at the time I remember hearing
[45:23.520 --> 45:26.880]  about police shooting people trying to walk out on the highway and then it was
[45:26.880 --> 45:31.320]  just a rumor the police have now been convicted and have gone to prison for
[45:31.320 --> 45:34.600]  that but the other word that never got completely confirmed was there was lots
[45:34.600 --> 45:41.000]  of killings going on both of looters who deserved it but also just of whoever
[45:41.000 --> 45:46.200]  the feds and police wanted to rob and I'm not saying all police but some units
[45:46.200 --> 45:49.960]  were actually caught looting themselves and on national television going into
[45:49.960 --> 45:55.080]  Walmart's and stealing but that there was a lot of cover-up going on of the
[45:55.080 --> 46:00.240]  amount of people that were killed yeah but I could probably say that there were
[46:00.240 --> 46:06.000]  a lot of questionable instances because we witnessed one particular incident
[46:06.000 --> 46:12.360]  with a police vehicle and it was at night pulled up to an abandoned palm shop
[46:12.360 --> 46:18.200]  we were at this intersection conducting house-to-houses searches for people that
[46:18.200 --> 46:21.400]  were still in the area asking them if they're because about this time as we
[46:21.400 --> 46:25.600]  were working on trying to get there basically chose these re-established
[46:25.600 --> 46:30.200]  and we were assessing the effect as far as okay are you getting electricity
[46:30.200 --> 46:36.200]  in your home yet or is your structure because I'm an engineer we would check
[46:36.200 --> 46:38.400]  the structures of the homeless stuff but that well when we were at this
[46:38.400 --> 46:44.000]  intersection we noticed the police car pulls up to an abandoned palm shop one
[46:44.000 --> 46:47.320]  officer he was both I'm gonna say he was an officer because he was dressed in
[46:47.320 --> 46:51.640]  uniform gets out of the car opens the truck pulls out look look like a logging
[46:51.640 --> 46:57.280]  chain wraps one in around a bumper and goes inside the driver was still in the
[46:57.280 --> 47:03.960]  car next thing we know he gets to the throttle real hard starts flying out of
[47:03.960 --> 47:08.800]  the parking lot and next in lo and behold a safe comes dragging out behind the
[47:08.800 --> 47:14.520]  police car so you know there's there's been instances of luck if it's been
[47:14.520 --> 47:18.800]  questionable well that's why citizens have got to be armed because in any
[47:18.800 --> 47:22.440]  collapse of society you're gonna have the low-level criminals and then you're
[47:22.440 --> 47:26.400]  gonna have statistically the number one threat especially in a place like New
[47:26.400 --> 47:30.720]  Orleans the police are gonna be out there robbing and real police are gonna
[47:30.720 --> 47:34.800]  be home with their families we're out there helping people but the corrupt
[47:34.800 --> 47:39.600]  system is so bad that they never punish the bad cops are rarely do and so the
[47:39.600 --> 47:43.520]  bad cops rise up through the ranks so well I mean there was the footage of the
[47:43.520 --> 47:47.600]  Walmart's and the targets and the grocery stores you know with the cops in
[47:47.600 --> 47:52.800]  there robbing everything and citizens reported that cops would pull up order
[47:52.800 --> 47:56.080]  them to give them their guns the police didn't care about the flooded
[47:56.080 --> 47:59.040]  poor areas it's the wealthy areas for those that don't know about New Orleans
[47:59.040 --> 48:02.000]  that are up on the high ground that's always been the valuable real estate
[48:02.000 --> 48:06.280]  that's where they went was to famous you know homes that are worth we're
[48:06.280 --> 48:10.200]  talking ten million dollars and that's where the police wanted to go I wonder
[48:10.200 --> 48:16.720]  why well because they were robbing the place and it's just absolutely amazing
[48:16.720 --> 48:23.320]  that this is going on on a separate note Ron talking to people that are in the
[48:23.320 --> 48:27.200]  military with you are are are they hearing word about all this brigade
[48:27.200 --> 48:35.080]  homeland and martial law training is going on as far as because I was met
[48:35.080 --> 48:38.400]  with our first half as far as first cabs mission has been concerned it's
[48:38.400 --> 48:44.760]  mostly locations in and out of Iraq we haven't had an established brigade from
[48:44.760 --> 48:50.200]  our division or my former division set for Homeland Security however we did
[48:50.200 --> 48:55.680]  have members from first infantry big red one that supposedly had been
[48:55.680 --> 49:00.200]  transferred to what would well be considered the North cops are an
[49:00.200 --> 49:08.760]  order and command in our an important all right sir well any other tidbits
[49:08.760 --> 49:17.560]  you'd like to relate to the audience just that you made a mention that the
[49:17.560 --> 49:23.480]  charity comes in the uniform it does but understand that not all of us in
[49:23.480 --> 49:29.200]  uniform are going to be the pirates oh no absolutely I'm saying I'm saying when
[49:29.200 --> 49:33.280]  tyranny comes it comes in a uniform we're not saying the uniform is tyranny
[49:33.280 --> 49:37.600]  but but that's why we've got to reach out to the uniform so that liberty comes
[49:37.600 --> 49:42.520]  from the uniform so the uniform protects the liberty and protects the Republic
[49:42.520 --> 49:46.360]  yeah I understand what you were saying I was I'm just basically trying to tell
[49:46.360 --> 49:50.480]  the rest of people also you know understand that there are those of us
[49:50.480 --> 49:55.640]  that do know what's going on that you know right from wrong and we will let
[49:55.640 --> 50:01.680]  you know hey this is what we we you know this is how we are God bless you sir I
[50:01.680 --> 50:06.120]  really appreciate your call good to hear from Ron we're gonna come back and go
[50:06.120 --> 50:11.680]  to Tim Steve and Jim and others military people who are aware of the gun
[50:11.680 --> 50:15.080]  confiscation drills going on or who were witnesses to what happened in
[50:15.080 --> 50:21.520]  Katrina because Katrina was a laboratory and the Pentagon calls all
[50:21.520 --> 50:25.240]  military operations a laboratory whether it's a drill or whether it's real
[50:25.240 --> 50:31.080]  whether it's simulated or whether it's real life it's all a training
[50:31.080 --> 50:35.920]  exercise and the feds admit I mean it's in the news they're doing gun
[50:35.920 --> 50:39.640]  confiscation drills all over the country and they're acclimating the public
[50:39.640 --> 50:43.040]  with the military to be on the streets to sell the military the police and the
[50:43.040 --> 50:48.160]  general public the civilians that all of this is kosher and acceptable and it's
[50:48.160 --> 50:52.560]  not and with all of these announcements of attacks on free speech and the rest
[50:52.560 --> 50:56.960]  of it there they're definitely yearning up for this we've got to get the word
[50:56.960 --> 51:06.040]  out ahead of time to check them this is not a drill repeat this is not a drill
[51:06.040 --> 51:10.520]  gun cells are on a staggering pace gun prices are going through the roof and
[51:10.520 --> 51:14.720]  that means desperate vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything

[54:44.600 --> 54:50.760]  need to realize this I need to have it really burn in to my psyche tyranny is
[54:50.760 --> 54:54.200]  here this is really happening there is a world government foreign banks are
[54:54.200 --> 54:58.920]  robbing us the planet is in revolt against it our way of life is being
[54:58.920 --> 55:03.320]  ended the government is so illegitimate it's openly overturning the bill of
[55:03.320 --> 55:09.440]  rights and constitution the supreme court has come out and said yeah we can
[55:09.440 --> 55:14.560]  just arrest whoever we want with no due process with indefinite detention I mean
[55:14.560 --> 55:19.400]  this is heavy-duty stuff that's going on it's all going to be used against us the
[55:19.400 --> 55:26.600]  American people and that's the big issue here this has happened in every other
[55:26.600 --> 55:32.120]  country this is what happens nine times out of ten or more often literally it's
[55:32.120 --> 55:36.760]  like nine nine percent of the time it's happening okay and a lot of people say
[55:36.760 --> 55:40.800]  well why do I care about tyranny also have my apartment my beer no you won't
[55:40.800 --> 55:46.040]  have that I mean if you just roll over to anything as Thomas Jefferson said the
[55:46.040 --> 55:50.000]  level of tyranny you will live under is the level you put up with I mean it's
[55:50.000 --> 55:55.720]  that simple and they are trying to turn the military against the people now I
[55:55.720 --> 55:58.280]  think it's backfired on them from all the intel I've gotten from all the
[55:58.280 --> 56:02.800]  feedback and a lot of times that happens because we do have a history of
[56:02.800 --> 56:07.560]  freedom and we you know our parents and grandparents did teach us about liberty
[56:07.560 --> 56:12.680]  to a certain extent and so people are relearning what they've forgotten let's
[56:12.680 --> 56:20.000]  go ahead and talk to Tim in Minnesota you're on the air go ahead oh yeah hi
[56:20.000 --> 56:25.420]  Alex welcome yeah yeah it looks a little bit of that I don't have as
[56:25.420 --> 56:29.920]  big Mississippi after serving six years in the army and what you had is you had
[56:29.920 --> 56:33.840]  the Coast Guard coming in with hundreds and thousands of gallons of water and
[56:33.840 --> 56:38.480]  generators and power lines set up you know almost immediately after it happened
[56:38.480 --> 56:44.160]  then you had the federal government you had the federal feds came in to start
[56:44.160 --> 56:47.920]  chopping all the power supplies and water lines and food lines and then so
[56:47.920 --> 56:52.280]  you had the National Guard going toe-to-toe with the the feds and you
[56:52.280 --> 56:56.440]  know there's kind of a little stand-up there you know you know almost a fist
[56:56.440 --> 57:01.200]  fight or something like that but but it's worse it's worse the the county
[57:01.200 --> 57:06.760]  sheriff or the parish sheriff was on CBS news and this came out and also
[57:06.760 --> 57:12.200]  newspapers that FEMA went in as the storm hit hours before the levees broke
[57:12.200 --> 57:18.960]  and cut the police communication lines and jammed cell phones they wanted this
[57:18.960 --> 57:23.720]  to be a disaster so they would then get more funding saying that FEMA didn't
[57:23.720 --> 57:27.480]  have enough power and it's the same story over and over again but what you're
[57:27.480 --> 57:32.320]  saying was on record the Coast Guard did a superlative job they were there
[57:32.320 --> 57:38.600]  within an hour their professionals and the scumbag FEMA didn't let them do
[57:38.600 --> 57:42.880]  their job go ahead correct I'd also like to make a really short quick comment on
[57:42.880 --> 57:47.320]  the other legal system ties to everything all your county courts are not
[57:47.320 --> 57:51.960]  they don't hold the Constitution at all what you have to do is you have to
[57:51.960 --> 57:55.440]  remove yourself from the jurisdiction and so you mentioned the word
[57:55.440 --> 58:00.040]  constitutional that's automatic jail time because what they run as an
[58:00.040 --> 58:05.040]  international maritime jurisdiction system which is a world court system and
[58:05.040 --> 58:11.880]  that's your county courts right now today I have seen federal court cases all
[58:11.880 --> 58:15.120]  over the country where the judge says I don't want to hear the Constitution in
[58:15.120 --> 58:21.440]  court and where the feds have put in filings where they admit we're under
[58:21.440 --> 58:27.120]  international UN law and we've had what for other Supreme Court justices that
[58:27.120 --> 58:32.640]  I've seen in the news say we're under UN control and that that's our law any
[58:32.640 --> 58:37.920]  other stories you want to tell from Katrina caller just about wrap it up
[58:37.920 --> 58:49.760]  God bless you thank you for listening to GCN be sure to visit GCN live comm today
[58:49.760 --> 58:54.080]  hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non
[58:54.080 --> 58:58.040]  hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that
[58:58.040 --> 59:01.640]  in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or
[59:01.640 --> 59:05.040]  gold it's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this
[59:05.040 --> 59:08.840]  country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends and
[59:08.840 --> 59:13.280]  solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they
[59:13.280 --> 59:18.280]  call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient
[59:18.280 --> 59:22.000]  dense food for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have
[59:22.000 --> 59:25.840]  not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to
[59:25.840 --> 59:30.320]  plant a full acre crisis garden so visit them today at survival seed bank

[59:45.720 --> 59:54.360]  ultimate barter item this is alex jones for survival seed bank comm waging war
[59:54.360 --> 01:00:07.800]  on corruption alex jones on the GCM radio networks big brother mainstream media
[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:15.280]  government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the
[01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:23.320]  GCM radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:36.400]  well five years after Katrina there's mainstream media reports denying that
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:40.720]  gun confiscation went on there we have other mainstream media reports with the
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:44.680]  military admits they are training for gun confiscation in the united states
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:49.480]  and we now have a video of an oathkeeper interview steward rhodes did with a
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:56.280]  sergeant who said that upwards of half the troops are even more he said at
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:01:00.960]  least half refused to be part of the gun confiscation in the early days and
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:06.520]  that's why the feds backed off from trying it statewide they did carry out
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:11.360]  the gun confiscation in thousands of predominantly wealthy homes police were
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:17.400]  caught looting all over the county all over the city all over the state so just
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:21.080]  amazing and that gives you an idea of where the government's going to be if
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:24.280]  there's an earthquake where the government's going to be if there's a
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:28.520]  problem and I've got to tell you the abuse I see from police in these
[01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:34.520]  situations against the citizens and again that doesn't mean all the police
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:39.120]  but it's on record is much worse from the police than it ever is from the
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:43.080]  military and I've got family who was in Katrina the military and they said the
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:46.960]  same thing the police units from all over the country were making women show
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:53.040]  their breast they were robbing these are the military officer call in who was
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:59.880]  there watching cops drag a safe out and from a pawn shop you've seen the cops
[01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:04.440]  robbing walmart and trying to kick people out so they could have the best
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:10.520]  stuff the television sets all I'm saying is if there's a collapse in this
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:18.040]  country on earthquake in Yellowstone a volcano in Yellowstone an earthquake in
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:23.000]  LA an earthquake on the Mississippi and they've had big ones there before that's
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:30.000]  why every few hundred years changes its course you cannot trust the government
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.960]  to be there to take care of you and wipe your nose and wipe your hind end and
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:38.560]  give you food I mean look the government it's now been what a month right at a
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:46.040]  month they can't stop a leak in the Gulf of Mexico it turns out Obama basically
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:50.200]  gave him waivers to not have the suppressor system that would have a
[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:54.640]  hundred percent stop the leak that every other major oil companies got because
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:58.680]  they're insiders they have an unfair trade advantage and that that oil rig
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:03.400]  had been given a specific award the Deepwater horizon on that drilling site
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:10.000]  just a few months before so this is all coming out but see that's what globalists
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:16.920]  do they screw up Katrina on purpose so FEMA gets more power there's a good
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:22.320]  chance they blew that oil rig as a pretext to shut down oil drilling in the
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:29.040]  Gulf except for select groups never let a good crisis go to waste but I know this
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:33.240]  in the great flood of the 1920s fact you guys printed that for me last week I
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:38.200]  never got to it but if you just Google the blowing of the levees the great
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:46.200]  flood in New Orleans or Louisiana you can actually see the old black and white
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:53.200]  photos of the army blowing the levy to flood the poor areas so that it didn't
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:56.280]  flood the rich areas that I mean that happened on record so that's where those
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:04:00.960]  rumors of them blowing it again come from is because everybody knows who lives
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:06.920]  in New Orleans it was done before when was the great flood 24 25 so I'm gonna
[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:12.280]  come back and try to quickly go to your calls go to Charles in Louisiana who's
[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:15.760]  always been a great source of news for us he first told us as part of the relief
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:21.160]  effort about police machine gunning families trying to leave over the high
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:25.560]  and dry highways oh they locked it down you couldn't leave see it was all a big
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:30.880]  drill and the police would follow the orders both federal state and local and
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:35.080]  all the MJTF that came in the military predominantly didn't and I'm not trying
[01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:40.840]  to say who's good and who's bad that's just the facts so the military is a lot
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:45.560]  more professional than the police every time we see a disaster so we'll talk to
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:49.440]  Charles Joe Steve Jim and others everybody stay there we're gonna come
[01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:53.200]  back go to your calls and replay these news clips of them confiscating

[01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:32.480]  you out of a parking garage grab you out of your house put a bag over your head
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:37.240]  and you disappear and now all over the country I see newscast where when they
[01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:41.000]  arrest somebody they're starting to put bags over their heads so the police are
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:45.160]  being trained to do this and you just are whisked off and disappear this is as
[01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:50.040]  bad as it gets and you've got the new Supreme Court nominee and a whole bunch
[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:54.120]  of White House czars cast Sunstein leading them in a key position
[01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:58.360]  regulatory czar saying you have no right to free speech period you have no
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:01.840]  right to private property you have no right to a website you have no right
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:06.800]  talk radio we can arrest you you have no second amendment right you know you
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:11.520]  have a right to basically turn your guns in that yes there is some right of the
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:14.600]  second amendment but that's only for the militia and the militia is the
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:22.480]  military it's a lie I mean this is a hundred percent evil but there's there's
[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:26.520]  no if fans are buts about it and they're really trying it they're hitting on all
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:30.840]  cylinders at every day it's all over the news how great it is and how we'll be
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:35.320]  safe if they can just secretly arrest us but don't worry it's a Pakistani guy
[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:39.560]  he's an American citizen but let you know let us just set the precedent with
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:44.240]  him I mean don't you agree I mean he's got brown skin he tried to blow up time
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:49.880]  square we'll keep you safe from these guys if you just let us secretly arrest
[01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:54.520]  whoever we want now are you worried about rag tag terrorists whether it's
[01:09:54.520 --> 01:10:00.240]  provocateur or real or staged and different events you know there's real
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:03.360]  terror there's stage terror there's provocateur terror there's terror they
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:09.200]  let take place but we don't know it's very suspicious but regardless I mean
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:13.440]  does America died do we lose all of our rights because somebody might commit a
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:17.960]  crime I mean a hundred years ago if one person committed a crime with a gun did
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:22.480]  they even talk about taking guns no we have guns to protect ourselves from the
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:27.200]  criminals I mean if somebody murders somebody with a car that happens all
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:30.120]  the time every few weeks I hear about somebody running over somebody with a
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:37.960]  car using it as a murder weapon do we ban cars and it just goes on and on and
[01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:45.320]  on so I want to go to Charles Jim Steve Joe Vincent and others but first for
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:49.840]  anybody in denial you just go up to YouTube or up to any search engine and
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:54.560]  you type in military confiscating guns in New Orleans or police confiscating
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:11:00.240]  guns in Louisiana and you will get I know it's more than 20 videos that are
[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:03.920]  out there because I did research on it again for police state for the rise of
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:09.760]  FEMA but it it's really going on it it's really happening and they're
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:15.160]  attempting to warp the military and turn them towards the dark side and so we're
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:20.640]  here saying no and it's heartening for those that missed the last hour when I
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:25.200]  talked about this video of a sergeant in the army in the National Guard of the
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:30.720]  time talking about how upwards of half or more of the troops said no we're not
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:35.160]  gonna confiscate guns and so they had to stop basically a statewide operation
[01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:40.000]  they were testing the military they were acclimating them just like they
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:45.840]  acclimate us because we're all together in this now Charles has always been a
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:50.520]  great source of info he reported here first the day it happened Charles has
[01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:56.320]  been calling in for 12 13 years now and he's just done an amazing job and
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:01.200]  Charles first reported because he was there part of the emergency efforts that
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:08.440]  the police shot a bunch of people trying to exit peacefully on the the highway
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:13.240]  overpasses that could get them out of the city so this was another drill where
[01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:16.840]  they were ordered to lock the city down and then not bring in food and water and
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:21.240]  the National Guard and the first on the scene the Coast Guard were blocked from
[01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:27.440]  bringing it all in to allow the Superdome to turn into the rape and murder and
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:33.600]  and and theft facility that it became so let's go to Charles in Louisiana Charles
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:38.600]  go ahead I'm doing great my friend well I just want to say one thing about this
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:42.840]  the thorough leak up there I think it's due to the intimate domain we just beat
[01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:47.320]  them two weeks up two weeks ago right before this and then they wanted to buy
[01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:52.040]  you boys this landing they said they're going to fight the government and all
[01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:55.880]  of a sudden now they could land ain't worth nothing now so I think that's
[01:12:55.880 --> 01:13:00.480]  what this arrow leaks about but anyway I'll report it to you about the Dome
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:04.120]  Stadium with the police wouldn't give them water when they had water right
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:08.640]  outside the Dome Stadium women were being raped and they and people would
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:13.600]  come out past a certain line they would put dogs on them asking for water begging
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:18.480]  for water mr. Jones I reported that to you and in the military I'm talking
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:23.880]  about the military now I was on on a St. Rock Street and they were telling women
[01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:27.160]  let me see your breath well how you're not too thirsty I'm baby I've got one
[01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:31.640]  woman had to raise the best with her baby in her arms with her baby in her
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:36.040]  arms and they would sit back there with their police and laugh at it you know
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:41.280]  what I mean they were just shooting people trying to leave arresting people
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:44.400]  trying to leave and I asked one of my sir why don't you go back to a night
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:50.120]  warden get the guns they said well there's snipers back there so they I
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:55.040]  mean they were they were sobbing jewelry stores stealing Cadillacs Joe
[01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:59.680]  Harry Lee had to put guards by the tunnels because they were cutting up
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:06.960]  the communication lines it's a truth and and it was blown the levee was blown
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:12.240]  I reported that dead bugs I reported to do they even found blasting caps on the
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:19.880]  levee it sounds unbelievable but you had to be there mr. Jones to see it well
[01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:25.000]  almost everything you first reported us came out I remember you days before the
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:31.400]  sheriff was on the news you know they're in the parish that New Orleans resides
[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:36.720]  in talking about the feds coming in and jamming the cell phones and cutting the
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:41.680]  tower lines and that they had to have an arms standoff with FEMA just to have
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:46.200]  their communication lines I mean just talk about wickedness why do you think
[01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:51.200]  FEMA did this think it was a drill to see how far we can go they was head for
[01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:54.640]  to have the military didn't confiscate the guns they had Mexican troops are
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:15:00.200]  going to come confiscate the guns they had so much water mr. Jones you wouldn't
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:04.560]  believe it and people were just dying at first and the water behind me and a
[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:08.160]  little guy come out in a reporter just they put one of them dogs on them you
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:12.080]  know he just bit all of his legs all between his legs it was it was it was
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:15.840]  something to see how I report I would go down every day and come back and
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:20.240]  report to you on the phone terms that come back but they had they were saying
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:23.560]  oh they're shooting at the helicopters mr. Jones it wasn't shooting at the
[01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:27.800]  helicopters they were letting them know where they were at they were on roofs you
[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:31.200]  know thirsty diner thirst and they were shooting a gun in the air to say we're
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:37.520]  over here now one hole was in the helicopter now one hole and the police
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:41.920]  they had a good old time they had a good time when the women would get off of
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:49.120]  the police women they would go to Walmart and shop shop it's I know it
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:52.600]  sounds crazy they were stealing from jewelry stores I mean right there on
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:55.600]  canal they were they were blackers off and then it would let it get to the
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:16:02.040]  jewelry store be robbed and it would let us go through it was a organize crime well
[01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:07.320]  that actually came out to all the video was shot of police just all over the
[01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:12.400]  place robbing and the media spotted and said well they need supplies that it
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:18.040]  would show a police woman walking out with a television set yes yes yes she
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:22.000]  would load it yes she would just load it up I mean it was it be and then people
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:25.200]  going to a grocery store try to get a little some help for their baby they
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:28.360]  would arrest them and all men do everything search them down if somebody
[01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:32.000]  had a gun they would just slap them look at that woman that they come to the
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:36.040]  door with a gun and knife on magazine street they threw her down busted off
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:39.800]  her mouth up she just asked them to leave a house they threw it out she was 53
[01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:44.960]  years old mr. Jones try to protect the house in the military they stomped on
[01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:50.080]  everything as soon as they got she got I let it sent out of state I tried to
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:56.000]  follow that out that's amazing well Charles God bless you and I appreciate
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.520]  your call the good news is the military and many levels did say no
[01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:03.600]  confiscating the firearms did you witness any of that while you were there
[01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:10.040]  no son didn't well I appreciate your call let's go ahead and go out to break
[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:15.760]  with this ABC news piece on record telling you how great it is to confiscate
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:25.440]  the guns today in New Orleans they got a lot tougher on the holdouts not only
[01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:32.840]  the flooded areas but New Orleans driest and wealthiest neighborhoods too the
[01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:38.800]  police and National Guard going street by street house to house
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:50.040]  they say there are no orders to use force just strong persuasion sometimes
[01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:56.440]  entering open houses with guns drawn instructions to disarm anyone inside
[01:17:56.440 --> 01:18:00.640]  we say guns guns will be taken no one will be able to be armed we'll take all
[01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:04.640]  weapons that happened today in this wealthy neighborhood where homeowners
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:09.960]  had armed themselves to protect their mansions residents were handcuffed on
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:13.720]  the ground in the end police took their weapons but let them stay in their
[01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:16.920]  homes they were a little bit threatened because our weapons were bigger than
[01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:22.120]  their weapons for many of the police and guard troops it is an uncomfortable job
[01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:27.960]  to do this in an American city this guard unit occupied a church using it as a
[01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:31.280]  base camp they had to leave a note because they could not get hold of the
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:37.160]  pastor to get permission it is surreal you just never you never expect to do
[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:41.720]  this in your own country Chris Montgomery says he'd rather be in Iraq than
[01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:45.440]  patrolling American neighborhoods walking over down these streets you don't
[01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:49.320]  you don't want to think about the stuff you have to do somebody pops around the
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:57.160]  corner and you shoot an American and they start the piece talking about how
[01:18:57.160 --> 01:19:00.560]  they don't get rough with people then it shows them slamming them down the
[01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:06.440]  ground going in mansions and putting people in handcuffs and taking their
[01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:13.760]  guns and then after the military would move on the MGTF police well this was
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:18.960]  this was a giant bank robbery they would just roll in and rob whatever they
[01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:24.240]  wanted and they were caught on video doing and here's the other issue very
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:29.120]  few of them got prosecuted so what does that tell you even if good police wanted
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:33.960]  to bring them to justice they weren't allowed to so remember what that means
[01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:38.720]  in a real crisis you've got to take care of yourself and that's what the second

[01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:25.240]  h1n1 real fast yeah but we're taking calls on this subject Jim I know I am
[01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:30.120]  good to that but I believe h1n1 was engineered for genetic markers that
[01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:36.000]  only took out Hispanics okay as far as gun confiscation I have a family member
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:41.840]  in federal law enforcement and I got bad news for you the government will tell
[01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:49.400]  him who is the bad guy he's a family member of race is five years old well
[01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:54.200]  whoever the government says is bad including me including you including
[01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:59.400]  anyone that's who he's going to follow yeah he owes his allegiance to the
[01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:04.040]  furor and if it means lining babies up and bashing the brains out I guess
[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:08.720]  that's what they'll do but he's a good guy I don't know how he could be changed
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:14.240]  this much but that's the way it is it's the petty power it's the peer pressure
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:18.880]  it's all the brainwashing all about how this is your brotherhood only it will
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:23.880]  protect you we're defending civilization if we don't cut corners
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:28.560]  everything will fall apart so tell him hey good he's chosen his side I wouldn't
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:33.040]  spend time on him I'd say good you back Goldman Sachs and foreign banks you back
[01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:36.760]  the Patriot Act and secret arrest you've chosen your side of history buddy I
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:40.720]  wouldn't plead with him because they get off on that I'd say good you've chosen
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:45.800]  Satan at least you've chosen a side Alex he's not that hard I think I could
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:50.840]  flip them we got it no no I didn't know the attitude with these guys the best
[01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:54.200]  way to get him to wake up is say you there's gonna come a time in your life
[01:25:54.200 --> 01:26:00.080]  when all your rationalization and all your denial is in your face and you
[01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:04.480]  know you're doing something wrong and if you buy increments do things that are
[01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:08.800]  wrong for the quote greater good in justifies the means you have turned
[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:12.880]  yourself over and so you're you know that point is gonna come and Mary have
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:18.000]  come in his life where he's got a decision to make okay and so you just
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:21.760]  lay it out and say and I'm done talking to you let me tell you this is serious
[01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:27.120]  enough with people that that make draconian statements like that that you
[01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:33.000]  know what you know I believe in shunning people I believe if they have an
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.480]  arrogant attitude now if you think you can wake him up that's fine but you know
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:41.240]  what people I've known people like life's too short folks I want to you'll be
[01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:45.120]  around people that are patriots in love freedom and are intelligent I don't want
[01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:49.880]  to be around people living in denial but I'm not go ahead Jim okay I think prayer
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:55.520]  is the most only power that's real I'm keeping my damn guns and I'm praying to
[01:26:55.520 --> 01:27:00.280]  the father that made me and his son that saved me and we're gonna rock this damn
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:03.560]  thing I appreciate your call but I'm really trying to get calls about the

[01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:24.840]  fellow one of your callers said that the tyranny comes in a uniform I believe

[01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:40.280]  it was like a a battle between the Coast Guard and the he met a political
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:45.040]  he met a political battle FEMA it's on record told him for five days no food no
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:49.600]  water okay I'm gonna try to get this out here and and and hang up and let you
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:55.040]  get go ahead I don't okay in part I don't respectful I don't agree with you
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:59.920]  that the problem is the international bankers number two my I have an associate
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:05.400]  mind that has a friend in the CIA he sent him a he communicated with him and
[01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:11.200]  there was a he said that the Times Square Times Square bomber that was all
[01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:16.000]  inside job and you're gonna have to find somebody else in the CIA to get you
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:22.000]  to documents and but it was all inside job to bring more confiscated it did
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:27.800]  come out two weeks ago that it was a that that individual was involved with
[01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:33.880]  the known CIA front in Pakistan but there's double agents triple agents I
[01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:36.120]  mean who knows the whole thing stinks I haven't go ahead
[01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:41.080]  okay number three there's the the you had a color I remember a while ago she
[01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:45.120]  said these people in the New World Order they think they're pirate and that's
[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:52.200]  what the deal is with the with the Coast Guard that were there and to find out
[01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:59.080]  what the core of the situation is people can search April 2007 deathbed deathbed
[01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:04.040]  confessions and that will bring you to where the the situation is with the
[01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:10.040]  pirates and who is the head of the pirates who is the head of the Coast Guard
[01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:15.240]  and I would greatly appreciate if you could get this guy on Eric shine I

[01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:41.800]  others did and FEMA blocked it so just because people are angry with the Coast

[01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:17.520]  to gun confiscation training going on and caller after caller has gotten off
[01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:22.440]  subject okay I do this a few times a week where I say it's on a subject and
[01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:27.680]  no if people call in with other stuff I'm just hanging up on you come on we need
[01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:31.960]  to leave the lines up and when I'm on a subject like this for people who have the
[01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:36.600]  actual information okay now we it's already admitted they did gun
[01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:40.800]  confiscation the issue is we have witnesses coming forward with name and
[01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:46.040]  rank saying there was a mass rebellion against the gun confiscation people
[01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:50.200]  saying no that's good news that's what we've been talking about but I wanted to
[01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:54.480]  play one more clip from the news we played one earlier of ABC telling people
[01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:57.640]  how great it is that the military and police were going around handcuffing
[01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:00.000]  people in their own homes and taking their guns never giving them back
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:06.280]  completely illegal well here's another newscast with a middle-aged lady in her
[01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:09.320]  home not wanting to leave she's high and dry got plenty of food she wants to take
[01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:14.480]  care of her her animals her dog and no they come in say where's your gun she
[01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:17.560]  goes well I've got this revolver and they take it away from her and slam her
[01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:22.280]  head in the ground here it is it was traumatic all of a sudden they were
[01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:28.360]  banging on the front door the side door and the back door and they so let us in
[01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:33.600]  Patty tried to explain she was on dry land she had plenty of food and water
[01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:39.920]  and didn't want to abandon her dogs but it didn't matter if you see six or eight
[01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:46.480]  police that look like linebackers pushing me in the corner you're here
[01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:52.400]  in shock I'm saying look at all my food I got plenty of food they kept pushing me
[01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:59.280]  back pushing me back and ended up like this then Patty showed them a small
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:04.200]  revolver she was carefully holding in the palm of her hand a camera crew was
[01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:12.720]  there to capture what unfolded next I said it's not even loaded and I
[01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:20.640]  dropped it on the floor well they punched me in the face look at my black
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:27.000]  and blue marks looking look at what they did to me they dragged me out of here I
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:32.600]  really thought they were gonna kill me I really did all right and that went on
[01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:37.160]  and on and on because she was telling him look I got food I got a firearm I
[01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:41.840]  could protect myself uh-uh when they saw a slave their attack dogs they've been
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:50.400]  trained when they saw a slave with a firearm it was like showing a coon dog
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:55.960]  a coon in a tree it was like greyhounds with the rabbit running I mean it was
[01:35:55.960 --> 01:36:01.320]  over and that's why it's so important that people are doing open carry
[01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:06.320]  everywhere to point out that in almost every state it is not against the law
[01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:12.560]  so that we take psychic ground back we take psychological ground back and point
[01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:16.560]  out hey our guns aren't illegal we're allowed to have our guns you understand
[01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:19.760]  because the government's trying to brainwash police and military that
[01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:23.960]  we're not allowed to own guns without even having a law and that's why this is
[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:31.360]  so important Joe in Texas former military go ahead hello Alex yes Joe yes

[01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:37.680]  confiscate any guns he is also told by his commanding officer that any stores
[01:37:37.680 --> 01:37:42.200]  large department stores you know bring back water his unit was told to bring
[01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:50.640]  back water and food to store up and they did his unit did open up on civilians
[01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:56.200]  and that is part of the reason why he's having been he's still in rehab he's no
[01:37:56.200 --> 01:38:03.960]  longer with New Orleans Police Department he did my it's my sister's son-in-law
[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:08.840]  which would be my nephew and he's no longer with New Orleans Police Department
[01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:12.720]  he's you know still having to take medication for what happened there and
[01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:19.920]  everything that was told as far as the truth Alex is is exactly what happened
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:25.240]  and his unit was told oh he says anybody with weapons if you feel threatened
[01:38:25.240 --> 01:38:34.320]  shoot him and you know but it's my eye I didn't suffer from post-traumatic Alex
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:40.440]  and I have my dad didn't use a stripper I was a stripper and I know there are
[01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:46.000]  military out there I'm also an oath keeper and I know there are military
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:50.640]  that have suffered and I think any veteran that's been in a war is gonna
[01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:54.880]  have some form of post-traumatic stress disorder but it doesn't mean we're gonna
[01:38:54.880 --> 01:38:59.480]  live it in a daily basis well I've seen the psychological studies if it's seen as
[01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:05.680]  a just war and you're actually fighting a military you don't have as much PTSD it
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:12.880]  is the emotional kicking down doors crying children shooting dogs doing
[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:17.480]  things that your gut that you're programming that your human tribal
[01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:24.680]  ingrained ingrained operating system tells you is wrong it doesn't matter if
[01:39:24.680 --> 01:39:29.440]  your commanders are telling you it's good your body basically turns against you
[01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:33.320]  your brain turns against you and sabotages you I mean everybody knows
[01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:38.040]  this I mean if I do mild things that are wrong but I'm not thinking about it you
[01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:41.840]  know sometimes I'll just do something and then I feel guilty about it I wake up
[01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:48.080]  at night feeling bad that's healthy that's normal but but I feel good when
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:53.640]  I do good things and so I want to do good things because that's what I'm
[01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:58.480]  supposed to do that's what I'm designed to do it's it's it if you don't have a
[01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:03.880]  conscience folks you're a sociopath or a psychopath and the system is trying to
[01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:09.960]  create artificial sociopaths and psychopaths and attack dogs but if you're
[01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:17.800]  not a real psychopath doing evil things is going to screw you up maybe one out
[01:40:17.800 --> 01:40:24.800]  of a hundred is a real psychopath one out of 30 or 40 nowadays is a sociopath but
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:30.920]  again they're trying to artificially screw up society with all these archetypal
[01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:35.280]  heroes like Jack Bauer that tortures innocent people but he gets the answers
[01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:40.800]  he needs they're they're warping everything you know first our heroes
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:44.700]  were Davey Crockett and George Washington and inventors and Lewis and
[01:40:44.700 --> 01:40:50.440]  Clark then our heroes were gangsters and basketball players and and and you know
[01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:54.840]  rock and roll stars that use a bunch of drugs now the heroes are people that
[01:40:54.840 --> 01:41:00.240]  torture so they're just slowly warping everyone's mind and I appreciate your
[01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:05.440]  call Joe God bless you okay Vincent in Virginia former military go ahead
[01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:12.000]  Alex how you doing pretty good sir I just wanted to I was not in a branch that
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:18.640]  was anywhere involved with any kind of confiscation of firearms although that
[01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:24.160]  area years before was where I went to tech school but I just wanted to make a
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:33.160]  comment about the I guess the immorality that I witnessed at my first base and a
[01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:39.280]  lot of the people that I was around when we were not at work you know there was a
[01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:44.520]  course a lot of partying everybody wanted to party myself included but there
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:52.320]  are also some groups of people who and seem to enjoy getting into you know
[01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:57.800]  with the Wiccan religion and witchcraft and they took it really
[01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:05.320]  seriously and I just I couldn't believe that these people spent their time
[01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:10.000]  doing that kind of stuff because I just to me it was just a waste of time but
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:14.600]  also you've got giant contingents this has even been on the news who are just
[01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:23.120]  entirely gang member whole units where the commander is the gang lord but I I
[01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:32.000]  did see one fellow he teed amaze me one time when we were we were at a camera
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.920]  and there was one of the restaurants that's usually open at night where he
[01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:40.760]  can go and buy you know something cheap tea and he sat at the table and he did
[01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:45.680]  the trick where he was able to break the heads off of spoons on all the sets of
[01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:50.240]  utensils around the table and I thought this this guy is really creeping me out
[01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:57.680]  and he ended up getting and I guess kicked out later I'm not gonna you know
[01:42:57.680 --> 01:43:03.960]  name any names but it was just some of the the people that I witnessed and they
[01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:09.080]  weren't bad people they weren't mean or vicious to anybody but they were just so
[01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:16.160]  open to anything I guess to give them a fix you know they were rudderless yeah
[01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:20.840]  exactly they had a void to fill personally and they were looking for
[01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:30.480]  anything to fill it and that's why the system tells you anything goes so that
[01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:34.760]  it's all just a mass of confusion and then the globalists can direct the big
[01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:41.880]  confused mass of idiots basically off the edge of a cliff I just had one more
[01:43:41.880 --> 01:43:48.440]  question about the oil rig explosion I had a have a friend I work with who
[01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:53.800]  retired I think he was a sergeant or something in the army during the first
[01:43:53.800 --> 01:44:00.600]  Gulf War and he told me that President Bush had signed a bill that allowed the
[01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:06.840]  oil companies not to install the safety equipment necessary to cut off you know
[01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:11.640]  yes in fact that was in the news a few days ago that Bush started that and
[01:44:11.640 --> 01:44:19.000]  Obama continued it it's basically waivers on their permits and that that
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:24.360]  was actually probably a subcontractor that ran the the rig itself yeah it was
[01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:28.400]  Halliburton and they were a subgroup under another group I forget its name
[01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:33.560]  right that's what BP try to do the first week was blame the subcontractor yeah
[01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:40.040]  but but I mean let's say I'm building a studio in my office I decide who the
[01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:43.720]  subcontractor is that I hire and I tell them what they can spend and what they
[01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:48.520]  can do so all the blame goes directly to BP and then the federal government
[01:44:48.520 --> 01:44:52.600]  after them not to the subcontractor the subcontractor was carrying out their
[01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:59.040]  contract right well I just wanted to say thank you for all the material you've
[01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:05.760]  put out it's it's a wealth of information I wish it was you know could
[01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:12.120]  be more positive I've had a lot of people that I work with many of them
[01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:16.360]  going into the military and I said well before you go please look at these
[01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:22.240]  these movies you know I burned some of your movies you know trying to put the
[01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:27.800]  subject matter in a way that they can understand it and just let them know you
[01:45:27.800 --> 01:45:31.880]  know if you're asked to do anything that's you know is unconstitutional
[01:45:31.880 --> 01:45:36.400]  don't go along with it you know be aware that the country is pretty much
[01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:41.960]  being controlled I've got a family member who's not going to say who but
[01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:49.200]  he's a professor and right now the for the second second job he's been at the
[01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:56.840]  administration is trying to basically get rid of him because he just you know
[01:45:56.840 --> 01:46:02.280]  doesn't fall into their socialist line of thinking for education well that's
[01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:06.840]  the big issue the so-called liberals who are just authoritarians with some sweet
[01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:14.080]  packaging and some perfume on it they are some of the most anti-freedom
[01:46:14.080 --> 01:46:18.160]  anti-freedom of speech people out there I mean look at Obama Republicans that
[01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:22.840]  supported Bush should have should love Obama expanding wars expanding torture
[01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:28.320]  expanding Patriot Act trying to pass legislation with Republicans to secretly
[01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:34.120]  arrest citizens for any reason they wish attacking freedom of speech and then
[01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:39.480]  prancing around calling himself a liberal I mean what does that even mean
[01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:45.080]  it is the terms mean nothing now it's all how they actually act how they
[01:46:45.080 --> 01:46:49.280]  behave and what they do I appreciate your call let's talk to Curt in Texas
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:55.640]  former military go ahead Kurt Alex yes sir this is Kurt from Lulun Texas
[01:46:55.640 --> 01:47:00.520]  pleasure to talk to you gonna talk to you thank you sir I served in the active
[01:47:00.520 --> 01:47:06.400]  duty army from 84 to 2005 I retired out of Fort Hood I was in Iraqi Freedom 1
[01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:13.160]  as far as weapon confiscation we did that in Iraq but one thing and I think it
[01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:17.080]  might raise your hopes a little bit I retired to start first-class combat
[01:47:17.080 --> 01:47:24.280]  engineer and you know we were this was back in the fall of 2003 during Ramadan
[01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:29.640]  and we went on an offensive up there where we were blowing up houses and we're
[01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:36.640]  just raising holy health and to crit and I had a brand new company commander and
[01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:40.440]  you know he was eager to impress his boss and we were looking for bomb-making
[01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:45.000]  material what not and we found a just like a big pile of copper wire in this
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:49.560]  house and all of a sudden he gave the order you know ten minutes grab
[01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:54.760]  everything he can and we're blowing up this house and I just stood up to him
[01:47:54.760 --> 01:47:57.840]  and I told him I said sir this isn't bomb-making material it's just copper
[01:47:57.840 --> 01:48:01.840]  wire there's no detonators there's no explosives by the way is very valuable
[01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:06.800]  people use it from string electricity they use it for primitive phone lines
[01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:11.240]  there those people I mean a lot of people I think I have some copper wire in
[01:48:11.240 --> 01:48:15.480]  my garage does that mean I'm a terrorist sir not at all but what I did do is now
[01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:19.600]  I didn't talk about this with my younger soldiers because they've got enough but
[01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:23.600]  we talked to you know with the senior NCO leadership about you know following
[01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:28.760]  lawful orders and so anyway I took him off to the side and I told him I'm not
[01:48:28.760 --> 01:48:32.720]  doing it because it's I told me it was unlawful that it wasn't bomb-making
[01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:38.120]  material and he paused and then I got on the horn and talked to the battalion
[01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:43.400]  commander and we saved that house you know but I saw firsthand there's a lot
[01:48:43.400 --> 01:48:47.560]  of people that weren't they wouldn't stand up and they would just do what they
[01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:52.760]  were told and well expanding on that we've seen the footage of troops find a
[01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:57.160]  family scavenging for firewood and they're looking for looters and so they
[01:48:57.160 --> 01:49:01.760]  say this is looting so they laugh and shoot the car then they run over it
[01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:04.880]  with an Abrams while laughing and they're just little kids that wanted to
[01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:09.200]  be at a monster truck rally but there's the family they're crying the cars the
[01:49:09.200 --> 01:49:15.000]  only thing they own a father a mother and two kids I mean again so you were a
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:20.960]  person of conscience a true warrior standing up for people meanwhile I mean
[01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:27.520]  what percentage of the troops just enjoyed blowing things up well I don't
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:32.320]  know Alex if I had to put a number on it I'd say it'd be less than 25% I mean
[01:49:32.320 --> 01:49:36.560]  there there were people but in the end though they got justice because they
[01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:41.280]  got out of control and they got carried away and then they would wind up later
[01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:47.040]  you know getting some type of judicial punishment later on down the road but
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:52.680]  what what I'm getting at is I didn't learn about all this stuff till 2007
[01:49:52.680 --> 01:49:58.800]  till the presidential election I was a diehard Republican you know I don't know
[01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:03.400]  if I call myself a sheep or not but I just I just believed you know and what
[01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:11.600]  we were doing and the war on terror all that stuff and my 18 year old son even
[01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:16.920]  just joined the army about three weeks ago and you know I'm scared to death
[01:50:16.920 --> 01:50:21.040]  for him but he knows the truth and he rose his hand and I know he's gonna do
[01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:25.680]  the right thing wow I just wish they weren't gonna shoot him up with all
[01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:29.920]  those vaccines but there's way to do ways to detox well that's great to hear
[01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:32.760]  that your son though is fully on board and knows about the New World Order then
[01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:38.160]  yes he does yes sir I talked about it when anybody's listening to me and it's
[01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:40.680]  hard because some people look at you like you're crazy but I don't care
[01:50:40.680 --> 01:50:45.800]  because I know in my heart I you know everything that I've seen I was in
[01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:50.920]  Desert Storm 2 and Bosnia and whatnot and I've seen the rules of engagement
[01:50:50.920 --> 01:50:56.640]  go from one end of the spectrum to the other and and it's sad but people are

[01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:11.200]  prisonplanet.tv we've got some guests coming up as well a lot of key news we
[01:54:11.200 --> 01:54:15.600]  haven't covered yet so thank you for joining us today but this is very
[01:54:15.600 --> 01:54:18.920]  heartening that when I talk to military on the street when I talk to family I
[01:54:18.920 --> 01:54:23.680]  get letters I see it on the news the military is really waking up even
[01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:27.000]  faster than the public because they're being given this illegal training now I
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.200]  want to go to Craig and Afghanistan here in a moment because it but there's a
[01:54:29.200 --> 01:54:32.840]  two-second delay so we'll have to deal with that but Kurt finishing up just
[01:54:32.840 --> 01:54:37.520]  briefly the change in the rules of engagement and we've seen as the rules
[01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:42.600]  of engagement have changed we're seeing more emotional problems mental problems
[01:54:42.600 --> 01:54:46.120]  from the troops because all the studies show when troops are made to do immoral
[01:54:46.120 --> 01:54:51.320]  things it screws them up go ahead Kurt. I agree Alex and I can't really go into
[01:54:51.320 --> 01:54:55.120]  too much detail about rules and engagement but one thing when I was
[01:54:55.120 --> 01:55:00.160]  there I was there with 1st Brigade 4th Infantry Division and I think one of
[01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:05.880]  your earlier callers said it right and it was if you feel threatened and you
[01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:10.840]  know it's a way different now almost to the point of well I won't even go there
[01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:15.400]  but now go there that well they're they're they're more they're defensive
[01:55:15.400 --> 01:55:18.760]  you know if they take fire in certain areas whatever they're not allowed to
[01:55:18.760 --> 01:55:22.800]  return it so I don't I haven't been over there in a long time but I still have
[01:55:22.800 --> 01:55:26.360]  friends that are in and I understand a few things gone from one extreme to the
[01:55:26.360 --> 01:55:32.560]  other yes sir and but anyway Alex hey I appreciate what you do you woke me up to
[01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:37.720]  a ton of things and I'm wondering if the thing that you talked about with the
[01:55:37.720 --> 01:55:42.000]  vaccines I can't explain that to to my son that well because I don't understand
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:46.600]  all the well 90 plus percent of the vaccines are made in China every batch
[01:55:46.600 --> 01:55:50.720]  that comes out is always quote defective but they still approve it it's full of
[01:55:50.720 --> 01:55:56.720]  cancer viruses RNA toxins I mean read the real insert from the H1N1 you can
[01:55:56.720 --> 01:56:02.200]  read it online just vaccine insert H1N1 or go to the pharmacy ask him to show
[01:56:02.200 --> 01:56:07.120]  you the insert for any vaccine it'll tell you how deadly it is okay Alex I
[01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:11.560]  did that my wife my wife that's the one thing she agreed with me out because I
[01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:17.040]  have 24 year old boys and I didn't want him to get the shot but she's very you
[01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:23.040]  know trusting and you know she and I told her I took her to the Walgreens and
[01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:27.840]  Lockhart and we looked at it and she just looked at me you know during the
[01:56:27.840 --> 01:56:33.120]  headlight like oh my god and so that that's thanks to you you know or
[01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:37.960]  otherwise yeah don't trust me just read the what really is in it and that oh it
[01:56:37.960 --> 01:56:41.640]  can cause brain damage it can sterilize you can cause Guillain beret it can cause
[01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:47.080]  all these neurological disorders it does have mercury yeah and then they even
[01:56:47.080 --> 01:56:50.600]  recalled a bunch of it I mean God bless you sir I appreciate your call

[01:56:57.720 --> 01:57:04.560]  hello Alex thanks for your hard work I'm just so calm that you know that I've
[01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:12.440]  been here for about six months and I've been watching the AFN news and been
[01:57:12.440 --> 01:57:20.280]  watching some commercials at the military army put out that show training
[01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:28.040]  in Fort Benning and they're training the foreigners you get they put them on
[01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:33.960]  like a little commercial and they're throwing in your face how they're just
[01:57:33.960 --> 01:57:41.680]  acclimating you to the foreign troops yeah they're foreign troops being trained
[01:57:41.680 --> 01:57:47.480]  for Benning I'm a contractor I'm a mechanic like I'm here to just support
[01:57:47.480 --> 01:57:52.680]  the troops and fix the vehicles I found out about what was going on while I was

[01:58:17.240 --> 01:58:23.960]  trying to help wake them up so that's all I'm afraid to it'll be any military

[02:00:20.120 --> 02:00:26.120]  Alex Jones we're talking to members of military contractors and others about
[02:00:26.120 --> 02:00:31.120]  all the gun confiscation drills the foreign troops openly being trained for
[02:00:31.120 --> 02:00:37.520]  domestic operations under NLE09 NLE010 the open announcements that they want to
[02:00:37.520 --> 02:00:40.760]  ban free speech arrest citizens for any reason they wish I mean this is
[02:00:40.760 --> 02:00:45.200]  mainstream news and we were talking to Craig a contractor a mechanic in
[02:00:45.200 --> 02:00:49.040]  Afghanistan he said he saw one of my films laying around and found out a lot
[02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:53.360]  of people are awake on the base and you know that's how this happens you don't
[02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:57.200]  have to believe me it's like Kurt calling in during the swine flu situation I
[02:00:57.200 --> 02:01:01.600]  said just read the insert don't believe me go to the drugstore and say I want to
[02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:06.320]  read the actual packet that comes with the ampule and it'll tell you
[02:01:06.320 --> 02:01:13.760]  everything mercury brain damage cancer sterilization is all possible very
[02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:18.480]  possible this is done by design that you're not given the vaccines for the
[02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:21.880]  reasons you're told the average doctor doesn't know this but they're starting
[02:01:21.880 --> 02:01:26.880]  to wake up talking to a doctor this weekend MD totally aware of all of it
[02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:32.920]  but but going back to I don't know if you see this in your area but is anybody
[02:01:32.920 --> 02:01:38.120]  talking at your base about the fact that it's on the news that oh we're helping
[02:01:38.120 --> 02:01:42.480]  grow the opium so the Taliban doesn't get it and oh you know we're we're here
[02:01:42.480 --> 02:01:46.800]  the poppy productions way up is anybody discussing that on the base you're at
[02:01:46.800 --> 02:02:01.000]  Craig I've given the video out of your ten minute YouTube about the the
[02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:05.440]  interview with all the little girl in the Marines I gave that up to a couple
[02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:10.240]  people and there's a couple other contractors that I've talked to you
[02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:17.240]  that know about what's going on and but mostly people just laugh if you say
[02:02:17.240 --> 02:02:22.280]  anything they say they say oh you're a conspiracy theorist stuff like that so
[02:02:22.280 --> 02:02:28.080]  even when the government admits it it doesn't exist
[02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:33.880]  all of it the people have shown you ready to their video to they understand
[02:02:33.880 --> 02:02:39.160]  and they believe it that that if unless they watch the video that they're not
[02:02:39.160 --> 02:02:42.680]  going to believe it yeah because I show them Reuters AFP a bunch of other
[02:02:42.680 --> 02:02:45.680]  mainstream articles with the headlines admitting it then I show her all though
[02:02:45.680 --> 02:02:51.000]  with the trip see that's the power of video that's why we talk about you know
[02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:56.880]  the proof is in the pudding I mean when I play a clip of you know John McCain or
[02:02:56.880 --> 02:03:02.520]  John or Joseph Lieberman saying we want to secretly arrest citizens under this
[02:03:02.520 --> 02:03:07.880]  new bill you know then they believe it but it is so unbelievable but I don't
[02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:10.920]  even blame people that laugh at us and call us conspiracy theorist I told you
[02:03:10.920 --> 02:03:14.800]  almost eight nine months ago last year I'm driving on the road I already knew
[02:03:14.800 --> 02:03:19.440]  they were producing the opium and shipping and out but I to hear BBC
[02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:24.720]  admitted all but say it was good I mean I couldn't believe it because it is
[02:03:24.720 --> 02:03:29.280]  unbelievable it is unbelievable I can't blame people who don't believe that
[02:03:29.280 --> 02:03:32.920]  they're putting cancer viruses and vaccines I mean I totally understand
[02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:35.600]  why you don't believe that I can't believe it even though I know it's true
[02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:41.760]  well anything else so you can add or anything else you want to add Craig
[02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:48.800]  well there's so one one of the AFM commercials that they put out is it's
[02:03:48.800 --> 02:03:53.840]  like they're the truth to watching the screen it's like they're and they're
[02:03:53.840 --> 02:04:03.720]  getting messages so it's like it's like there okay message act one we've
[02:04:03.720 --> 02:04:15.720]  identified the the the target act to or dropping in special forces to an act
[02:04:15.720 --> 02:04:21.760]  three it's you know it's it's kind of it's really weird it's I'm kind of
[02:04:21.760 --> 02:04:25.880]  very much thank you oh it's getting really creepy I mean when you watch a
[02:04:25.880 --> 02:04:30.120]  basketball game and every time they make a basket and I've seen this myself
[02:04:30.120 --> 02:04:33.960]  callers have called in about it every time that they make a basket they cut
[02:04:33.960 --> 02:04:39.760]  to troops and it's not to honor the troops it's to associate the goal and
[02:04:39.760 --> 02:04:45.800]  the height than state of pleasure with troops it's Pavlovian ring a bell give a
[02:04:45.800 --> 02:04:49.760]  piece of bacon to the dog ring a bell give a piece of bacon to the dog you

[02:08:28.480 --> 02:08:33.760]  most the time talking to military about the fact that they're being trained to
[02:08:33.760 --> 02:08:38.240]  carry out domestic operations gun confiscation I will continue with your
[02:08:38.240 --> 02:08:43.800]  phone calls we have several guests coming up as well Edwin Vieira will be
[02:08:43.800 --> 02:08:47.800]  joining us constitutional law scholar to talk about states rights and the
[02:08:47.800 --> 02:08:52.920]  movement against tyranny also coming up Napolitano hasn't reviewed and detail
[02:08:52.920 --> 02:08:57.440]  the Arizona immigration law she criticized she admitted an interview she
[02:08:57.440 --> 02:09:01.480]  hasn't even read it well I have read the bill and it says after police make
[02:09:01.480 --> 02:09:07.240]  first contact if they have probable cause a suspicion like massier driver's
[02:09:07.240 --> 02:09:15.640]  license I don't have one well are you a citizen no boom that's a crime but
[02:09:15.640 --> 02:09:20.160]  illegals are even more above the law than that in fact let's just go ahead and
[02:09:20.160 --> 02:09:25.880]  play the clip right now here it is I might ask if you had a chance to review
[02:09:25.880 --> 02:09:32.360]  the new law that was passed by the state of Arizona I have not reviewed it in
[02:09:32.360 --> 02:09:37.320]  detail I certainly know of it senator so you're not prepared to make a judgment
[02:09:37.320 --> 02:09:51.040]  on it senator that is not a law let me just say this as you know and are well
[02:09:51.040 --> 02:09:58.520]  aware that's not the kind of law I would have signed and for what reason well
[02:09:58.520 --> 02:10:04.280]  because I believe that it it's a bad law enforcement law I believe it mandates
[02:10:04.280 --> 02:10:08.520]  and requires local law enforcement or puts them in a position many do not
[02:10:08.520 --> 02:10:16.080]  want to be placed in when when I was dealing with laws of that ilk most of
[02:10:16.080 --> 02:10:20.600]  the law enforcement organizations in Arizona at that time were opposed to
[02:10:20.600 --> 02:10:26.640]  such legislation okay think about this when I had the awesome police chief in
[02:10:26.640 --> 02:10:30.640]  year and a half ago or so the first time I interviewed him and I talked about
[02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:36.440]  Austin being a sanctuary city 800 plus in the nation over 800 and I said why
[02:10:36.440 --> 02:10:39.240]  don't you arrest illegal aliens for drunk driving why don't you arrest illegal
[02:10:39.240 --> 02:10:43.040]  aliens for committing crimes why don't you arrest illegal aliens and he said
[02:10:43.040 --> 02:10:47.240]  well then they wouldn't trust us to call us when they need us I mean it's on
[02:10:47.240 --> 02:10:51.520]  record the illegals have more rights than citizens we've had illegal aliens
[02:10:51.520 --> 02:10:57.280]  call into the show and admit that they're basically above the law or they do
[02:10:57.280 --> 02:11:04.440]  get arrested it's a $10 maybe $50 fine I mean it's all over the news that four
[02:11:04.440 --> 02:11:10.240]  or five times the same illegal alien whether it's in Dallas Texas or Tucson
[02:11:10.240 --> 02:11:14.280]  Arizona I've seen cases in California where over and over again they drunk
[02:11:14.280 --> 02:11:18.760]  driving hit people and the police don't even arrest them on the scene because the
[02:11:18.760 --> 02:11:22.200]  courts know there's no money in that person and the system wants them
[02:11:22.200 --> 02:11:26.800]  released and so oh it puts law enforcement in a bad position they have
[02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:31.200]  to enforce the law heaven forbid they're not just out there riding speeding
[02:11:31.200 --> 02:11:36.520]  tickets and not out there you know providing security for government
[02:11:36.520 --> 02:11:40.680]  buildings for non-existent threats God forbid cops actually go after criminals
[02:11:40.680 --> 02:11:44.840]  and look a lot of hard-working people come up here from Mexico and Mexico has
[02:11:44.840 --> 02:11:48.760]  collapsed it's in trouble but if you've got a lifeboat and the other ships just
[02:11:48.760 --> 02:11:52.880]  sunk and you've already taken more people on your boat than is safe if you
[02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:57.520]  just take unlimited your boat will sink as well but statistically many people
[02:11:57.520 --> 02:12:01.840]  fleeing justice from by the way all over the world not just Mexico Mexico is the
[02:12:01.840 --> 02:12:06.520]  biggest you know nation immigrating they come here serial killers murderers
[02:12:06.520 --> 02:12:13.120]  arsonist rapists and time and time again they just get away with murder and so
[02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:17.920]  the question is why are they getting away with murder and it's because the
[02:12:17.920 --> 02:12:22.000]  system wants them here they want unlimited numbers of them here because as
[02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:25.360]  long as they're given welfare and as long as the nanny state big government
[02:12:25.360 --> 02:12:32.200]  poses as their friend statistically in over 90% of the cases you can pull the
[02:12:32.200 --> 02:12:37.480]  national numbers they vote for anti-gun legislation globalist legislation
[02:12:37.480 --> 02:12:41.520]  quote free government health care and I've got numbers here today I'm gonna
[02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:46.200]  cover up for getting to some more of the news where in Texas hundreds and
[02:12:46.200 --> 02:12:51.000]  hundreds of physicians are quitting and thousands are talking about it and I see
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:56.880]  these articles every two or three days from Florida or Texas or California where
[02:12:56.880 --> 02:12:59.640]  the state boards are complaining that doctors are just saying you know what
[02:12:59.640 --> 02:13:04.360]  I'm 55 I'm not gonna work another 10 years I've already got to buy all this
[02:13:04.360 --> 02:13:10.440]  liability malpractice insurance most doctors do not make that much money and
[02:13:10.440 --> 02:13:14.800]  and by the way they have to go to on average eight years of school so the
[02:13:14.800 --> 02:13:20.680]  average person professional four years of school they have to especially trauma
[02:13:20.680 --> 02:13:25.120]  surgeons I mean it's stressful doing heart surgery folks it's stressful doing
[02:13:25.120 --> 02:13:30.760]  brain surgery it is stressful having a child come in who's been in a car wreck
[02:13:30.760 --> 02:13:37.520]  whose head smashed in and then watching that child red line and die so we need
[02:13:37.520 --> 02:13:43.160]  to pay doctors a lot of money and the media has lied about this and implied
[02:13:43.160 --> 02:13:47.200]  that doctors are the reason health care costs have gone up I've looked at the
[02:13:47.200 --> 02:13:51.360]  numbers 30 years ago doctors were making on average almost double what
[02:13:51.360 --> 02:13:55.680]  they're making now okay now there are some specialists and you know plastic
[02:13:55.680 --> 02:14:00.240]  surgeons and some special you know top cancer people you know who might be
[02:14:00.240 --> 02:14:04.240]  making a million dollars a year but most doctors are making under a hundred
[02:14:04.240 --> 02:14:10.320]  thousand dollars a year under a hundred thousand dollars in fact Google the term
[02:14:10.320 --> 02:14:15.840]  average MD salary in the US I saw it last year I believe it was ninety seven
[02:14:15.840 --> 02:14:19.720]  thousand dollars but I'm not going off my memory oh let's imagine you got a
[02:14:19.720 --> 02:14:25.000]  half million dollars in many cases for your all your college and medical school
[02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:31.360]  bills half million dollars and so it's gonna take you if you're making ninety
[02:14:31.360 --> 02:14:36.840]  seven thousand dollars what a decade or two to pay that off I mean you know I
[02:14:36.840 --> 02:14:40.160]  know lots of medical doctors now who are living in an okay little house or an
[02:14:40.160 --> 02:14:44.120]  okay apartment I mean I know people who were both husband and wife are
[02:14:44.120 --> 02:14:50.080]  doctors Harvard graduates and they're living in a three hundred thousand
[02:14:50.080 --> 02:14:54.520]  dollar house I mean that's a cracker box in Austin Austin's one of the more
[02:14:54.520 --> 02:14:59.320]  expensive places in Texas but but look don't worry they're just quitting they're
[02:14:59.320 --> 02:15:04.680]  leaving they're done and others in mass are saying I'm not accepting Medicare
[02:15:04.680 --> 02:15:10.520]  and Medicaid anymore I'm not accepting Medicare because the part of the
[02:15:10.520 --> 02:15:17.440]  healthcare bill they say is a 22% cut across the board of Medicare and that's
[02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:25.280]  in the AP today but some doctors some specialist it's less than 22 but many
[02:15:25.280 --> 02:15:32.080]  others it's more than 50% so you do a procedure and you don't even get paid
[02:15:32.080 --> 02:15:37.200]  the money that'll pay the nurses and yourself and the anesthesiologist and
[02:15:37.200 --> 02:15:44.240]  and you notice it's mainly Medicare people you know who are older who need
[02:15:44.240 --> 02:15:49.120]  the heart surgeries so I was reading in the article today about how heart
[02:15:49.120 --> 02:15:53.600]  surgeons and people that deal with the vascular system are one of the biggest
[02:15:53.600 --> 02:15:57.200]  groups just saying I'm done they're either quitting or they're saying I'm not
[02:15:57.200 --> 02:16:03.200]  accepting Medicare well Ron Paul you know wasn't accepting it 25 years ago
[02:16:03.200 --> 02:16:09.440]  when he was practicing medicine because of this but he did have low rates so if
[02:16:09.440 --> 02:16:12.440]  you don't have government and big corporations and insurance companies in
[02:16:12.440 --> 02:16:17.760]  the middle stealing the money and investing it in derivatives if you don't
[02:16:17.760 --> 02:16:23.040]  have all of that getting in the way and you've got true free market in your
[02:16:23.040 --> 02:16:27.040]  health care you have the best in the world and the least expensive in the
[02:16:27.040 --> 02:16:30.840]  world but also big pharma is also involved in the health care bill
[02:16:30.840 --> 02:16:36.840]  mandating that oh you don't get a knee surgery with your insurance no we now
[02:16:36.840 --> 02:16:41.960]  mandate you just get drugs or a cortisone steroid shot so well I've
[02:16:41.960 --> 02:16:47.120]  already gotten into the subject like let me try to find it here in my stack
[02:16:47.120 --> 02:16:54.600]  sometimes it's just quicker just to just to reprint the article but it was I
[02:16:54.600 --> 02:16:57.920]  mean I'm sure you've seen it it's been all over the news that doctors are just
[02:16:57.920 --> 02:17:03.600]  quitting everywhere or refusing to take Medicare here it is this is the
[02:17:03.600 --> 02:17:07.480]  Houston Chronicle I have an AP article as well in the stack Texas doctors
[02:17:07.480 --> 02:17:12.920]  opting out of Medicare at alarming rate and I never really seen national
[02:17:12.920 --> 02:17:15.800]  stories with the national numbers I guess those haven't been compiled yet but
[02:17:15.800 --> 02:17:22.520]  I I've seen it in Michigan New York Florida Texas all over where well here's
[02:17:22.520 --> 02:17:28.080]  an example everywhere I go doctors tell me how they just want to quit I was
[02:17:28.080 --> 02:17:31.400]  talking to a doctor who's far from retirement and he was discussing how
[02:17:31.400 --> 02:17:36.480]  he's an emergency room emergency medicine MD and how in the last couple
[02:17:36.480 --> 02:17:40.320]  years and I'd also seen this in the news they've started as a way to harass
[02:17:40.320 --> 02:17:46.080]  doctors they're the doctors not the bureaucrats having people at hospitals
[02:17:46.080 --> 02:17:51.840]  fill out customer satisfaction forms and I was telling this doctor about my dad
[02:17:51.840 --> 02:17:55.760]  who's a dentist and he says beautiful women will come in and say pull my
[02:17:55.760 --> 02:17:58.960]  tooth it hurts nothing's wrong with their tooth they want to bottle of
[02:17:58.960 --> 02:18:01.880]  painkillers so they're ready to have their tooth pulled out and he'll say no
[02:18:01.880 --> 02:18:05.600]  and they'll get mad and make a rassing phone calls and try to make
[02:18:05.600 --> 02:18:09.880]  complaints and the doctor said absolutely he said doctors are on the
[02:18:09.880 --> 02:18:13.480]  verge of quitting everywhere because since this went in in the last two years
[02:18:13.480 --> 02:18:18.680]  it is just incredible he said I'll be in there with a dying child from a car
[02:18:18.680 --> 02:18:25.680]  wreck no they're dying and the person will bust in and say I want my drugs
[02:18:25.680 --> 02:18:29.480]  and they'll go look at the database or call the hospital across town and found
[02:18:29.480 --> 02:18:36.120]  find out two hours ago they were given 45 you know hydrocodones or whatever
[02:18:36.120 --> 02:18:40.520]  those you know pain pills are and then I kind of felt guilty of the time I was
[02:18:40.520 --> 02:18:43.480]  down the emergency room on a Sunday I'd basically cut my finger off it was
[02:18:43.480 --> 02:18:47.320]  dangling and I was watching illegal aliens would say they had stomach aches
[02:18:47.320 --> 02:18:50.400]  and stuff going ahead of me I was being patient I was worried they wouldn't be
[02:18:50.400 --> 02:18:54.720]  able to fix my finger and it is numb to this day and I kind of got up there but
[02:18:54.720 --> 02:18:59.440]  I was very cold and I said listen listen you need to do this and then the lady
[02:18:59.440 --> 02:19:03.000]  was honest we're waiting for a surgeon to get here sir we don't have anybody
[02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:06.440]  with that expertise right now then the lady showed up and she was a fan of the
[02:19:06.440 --> 02:19:09.600]  show and brought me back and said I know you don't want to take a tetanus shot and
[02:19:09.600 --> 02:19:12.680]  I don't like vaccines either but this is really one you need you cut you know you
[02:19:12.680 --> 02:19:16.800]  cut this on the side of a barge it's the exact kind of thing and I just said I
[02:19:16.800 --> 02:19:23.560]  don't care I wave liability verbally in front of all of you sew it up and so she
[02:19:23.560 --> 02:19:29.200]  spent about 20 minutes with just you know with that iodine substance just
[02:19:29.200 --> 02:19:34.600]  scrubbing it and and in going over and getting in the cracks and and then she
[02:19:34.600 --> 02:19:39.400]  she did a good job and sewed it up now I'm very appreciative of that but I was
[02:19:39.400 --> 02:19:43.720]  feeling guilty it kind of gave me another perspective of where he said one
[02:19:43.720 --> 02:19:47.320]  time there was a dying child and this person bust in screaming demanding
[02:19:47.320 --> 02:19:51.520]  drugs that person should be I'm not for police brutality but those drug heads
[02:19:51.520 --> 02:19:55.960]  need to have their teeth knocked in so I mean the doctors are just under siege
[02:19:55.960 --> 02:20:00.640]  ladies and gentlemen they have the most stressful job there is Lee and we're
[02:20:00.640 --> 02:20:03.960]  gonna lose them this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider
[02:20:03.960 --> 02:20:08.200]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[02:20:08.200 --> 02:20:12.400]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[02:20:12.400 --> 02:20:16.320]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[02:20:16.320 --> 02:20:19.960]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:20:19.960 --> 02:20:24.520]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:20:24.520 --> 02:20:29.160]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[02:20:29.160 --> 02:20:32.920]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[02:20:32.920 --> 02:20:36.400]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[02:20:36.400 --> 02:20:40.320]  onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[02:20:40.320 --> 02:20:43.480]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[02:20:43.480 --> 02:20:47.160]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[02:20:47.160 --> 02:20:51.960]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar
[02:20:51.960 --> 02:20:56.920]  backup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to mysolarbackup.com
[02:20:56.920 --> 02:21:04.600]  or call 1-877-327-0365 they help to create a new world order we are part of a
[02:21:04.600 --> 02:21:10.240]  new world order a new world order based upon collective action invisible empire
[02:21:10.240 --> 02:21:13.400]  is a damning indictment of the globalist through their own words and
[02:21:13.400 --> 02:21:17.720]  documents the new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of
[02:21:17.720 --> 02:21:22.240]  possibilities it means all the world under their control the United Nations
[02:21:22.240 --> 02:21:26.440]  would take over America the tri-lateral Commission would control the world
[02:21:26.440 --> 02:21:30.920]  invisible empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in

[02:24:13.800 --> 02:24:16.960]  but regardless i mean that is not that much money considering what the
[02:24:16.960 --> 02:24:18.560]  education cost
[02:24:18.560 --> 02:24:21.760]  the intelligence level it takes to make a three medical school

[02:24:24.920 --> 02:24:26.880]  and
[02:24:26.880 --> 02:24:29.840]  they're always getting the blame for everything and so they're just saying
[02:24:29.840 --> 02:24:31.480]  i'm gonna do something else
[02:24:31.480 --> 02:24:33.320]  i'm done

[02:24:39.560 --> 02:24:41.240]  and then they'll fully wreck it
[02:24:41.240 --> 02:24:43.960]  and we'll have total government health care
[02:24:43.960 --> 02:24:46.320]  and then they'll be able to decide
[02:24:46.320 --> 02:24:48.040]  what type of care you get
[02:24:48.040 --> 02:24:49.880]  how long you're allowed to live
[02:24:49.880 --> 02:24:52.240]  it's just like new york state
[02:24:52.240 --> 02:24:56.680]  bans midwives home births you will have your baby at the government
[02:24:56.680 --> 02:24:57.720]  facility
[02:24:57.720 --> 02:25:01.040]  you will have a cps visit when your baby's born
[02:25:01.040 --> 02:25:04.560]  if you have trouble suckling the baby which is totally normal
[02:25:04.560 --> 02:25:07.120]  in the first day or two because the baby's learning
[02:25:07.120 --> 02:25:09.720]  now they're calling that abuse and taking your children
[02:25:09.720 --> 02:25:11.880]  this is a scientific
[02:25:11.880 --> 02:25:17.320]  tyranny where they make everyone a criminal but them the criminals
[02:25:17.320 --> 02:25:19.920]  you know people think well we can turn the tide against this of the
[02:25:19.920 --> 02:25:22.200]  republicans are gonna get into office well
[02:25:22.200 --> 02:25:25.400]  actually the numbers show that incumbents are being thrown out republicans and
[02:25:25.400 --> 02:25:26.320]  democrats
[02:25:26.320 --> 02:25:30.800]  the problem is the media is making newt genrich as i predicted last year
[02:25:30.800 --> 02:25:31.880]  the leader
[02:25:31.880 --> 02:25:34.320]  of the resistance
[02:25:34.320 --> 02:25:37.640]  the the political leader and he's in political today
[02:25:37.640 --> 02:25:42.120]  genrich forecast obama loss he believes that the republicans will take the house
[02:25:42.120 --> 02:25:43.680]  and the senate
[02:25:43.680 --> 02:25:45.520]  uh... in the november elections
[02:25:45.520 --> 02:25:48.520]  and that he's gonna run for president in twenty twelve
[02:25:48.520 --> 02:25:51.440]  this is a guy who's written books calling for world government
[02:25:51.440 --> 02:25:54.520]  who wants a global carbon tax
[02:25:54.520 --> 02:25:57.840]  this guy is a sack of garbage oh he's pro war
[02:25:57.840 --> 02:26:00.720]  and so if you consider that to be conservative i guess you should vote
[02:26:00.720 --> 02:26:01.440]  for him
[02:26:01.440 --> 02:26:03.920]  and enjoy your carbon taxes and everything else
[02:26:03.920 --> 02:26:08.520]  uh... newt genrich i mean give me a break i got news for you newt
[02:26:08.520 --> 02:26:10.280]  just like john mccain and others
[02:26:10.280 --> 02:26:11.840]  you are being exposed
[02:26:11.840 --> 02:26:13.000]  and you are not
[02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:14.400]  going to win
[02:26:14.400 --> 02:26:17.920]  former house speaker newt genrich gives president obama
[02:26:17.920 --> 02:26:21.080]  only a twenty percent chance of being reelected i agree with that
[02:26:21.080 --> 02:26:24.120]  and says he might be the one to give obama the boot
[02:26:24.120 --> 02:26:27.880]  that's right again rich who this week published a book called to save america
[02:26:27.880 --> 02:26:29.840]  all yes newt
[02:26:29.840 --> 02:26:32.280]  uh... globalist builder burg attendee
[02:26:32.280 --> 02:26:35.440]  stopping obama's secular socialist machine
[02:26:35.440 --> 02:26:38.600]  well i mean uh... bush triple the size of government
[02:26:38.600 --> 02:26:41.320]  i mean you're all for secret arrest and tyranny
[02:26:41.320 --> 02:26:43.440]  i mean you want to love obama
[02:26:43.440 --> 02:26:46.600]  so with republicans like newt genrich
[02:26:46.600 --> 02:26:49.920]  who needs hugo chavez i mean it's
[02:26:49.920 --> 02:26:53.320]  newt genrich is a singularly nasty
[02:26:53.320 --> 02:26:56.360]  disgusting unamerican piece of trash
[02:26:56.360 --> 02:27:00.120]  and he's even worse because he's always parading around
[02:27:00.120 --> 02:27:03.360]  like he's this big libertarian conservative
[02:27:03.360 --> 02:27:06.160]  i just can't stand his arrogance and
[02:27:06.160 --> 02:27:09.880]  all the propaganda he pushes and i'm so sick of
[02:27:09.880 --> 02:27:12.360]  of john mccain and and and and
[02:27:12.360 --> 02:27:16.680]  admit romney and all these other people
[02:27:16.680 --> 02:27:21.160]  uh... folks if you vote for met romney if you vote for newt genrich if you vote
[02:27:21.160 --> 02:27:22.640]  for any of these people

[02:27:24.640 --> 02:27:25.840]  it doesn't matter
[02:27:25.840 --> 02:27:28.720]  who becomes president that that's hard to capture
[02:27:28.720 --> 02:27:31.120]  but obama got over a billion bucks to get elected
[02:27:31.120 --> 02:27:34.080]  they're talking about more money in the next election
[02:27:34.080 --> 02:27:38.240]  close to two billion spent total on the election even more of you count outside
[02:27:38.240 --> 02:27:39.560]  you know uh...

[02:33:26.280 --> 02:33:28.440]  this is unconstitutional

[02:33:42.400 --> 02:33:43.800]  member bush
[02:33:43.800 --> 02:33:47.240]  things would be a heck of a lot easier this was a dictatorship
[02:33:47.240 --> 02:33:50.080]  just so long as i'm the dictator
[02:33:50.080 --> 02:33:53.480]  uh... blanche flower europe could break up
[02:33:53.480 --> 02:33:55.720]  another bailout inevitable

[02:34:11.320 --> 02:34:16.680]  and uh... programs and plans he has to take back the states at the state level
[02:34:16.680 --> 02:34:18.840]  so solutions coming up
[02:34:18.840 --> 02:34:20.160]  in the fourth hour
[02:34:20.160 --> 02:34:25.600]  but i appreciate her coming on uh... he related email to her and she got it
[02:34:25.600 --> 02:34:27.040]  uh... to us
[02:34:27.040 --> 02:34:29.400]  and so i called uh...
[02:34:29.400 --> 02:34:34.040]  his lawyer david uh... hammers lawyer jessie trunadou
[02:34:34.040 --> 02:34:38.040]  and uh... talk to his paralegals and confirmed uh... that she's been a key
[02:34:38.040 --> 02:34:39.840]  oklahoma city
[02:34:39.840 --> 02:34:42.480]  uh... researcher
[02:34:42.480 --> 02:34:47.200]  i got in uh... with jessie trunadou to get the side affidavit from terry nickles
[02:34:47.200 --> 02:34:51.360]  one of the co-conspirators on this uh... oklahoma city bombing
[02:34:51.360 --> 02:34:55.640]  that yes mcvay was a government operative and told him he was an operative uh...
[02:34:55.640 --> 02:34:59.880]  that we separately have police military other testimony we've gotten secret
[02:34:59.880 --> 02:35:01.800]  federal documents the trunadou has
[02:35:01.800 --> 02:35:04.280]  suit in federal court to be released
[02:35:04.280 --> 02:35:07.840]  uh... where the head of the fb i anti-terror force was in oklahoma city
[02:35:07.840 --> 02:35:09.000]  and lied about it
[02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:10.680]  and was intimately involved
[02:35:10.680 --> 02:35:14.080]  of interviewed uh... people that survived in the offer people are building
[02:35:14.080 --> 02:35:15.880]  fifteen years ago like jane graham
[02:35:15.880 --> 02:35:17.360]  i'm just recapping this
[02:35:17.360 --> 02:35:21.400]  who saw mcvay and military operatives in there as maintenance people planning
[02:35:21.400 --> 02:35:22.880]  great sticks of butter
[02:35:22.880 --> 02:35:25.240]  she thought they were working on the telephones
[02:35:25.240 --> 02:35:27.840]  i mean it goes on and on this was a government operation
[02:35:27.840 --> 02:35:31.280]  so to even get into oklahoma city almost does it disservice to just
[02:35:31.280 --> 02:35:35.600]  briefly talk about it but that's all the time we have today
[02:35:35.600 --> 02:35:38.680]  mister hammer had been allowed to do interviews
[02:35:38.680 --> 02:35:42.480]  which when i have the federal court rulings is unconstitutional
[02:35:42.480 --> 02:35:43.880]  for eleven years
[02:35:43.880 --> 02:35:46.640]  the last interview he did was with uh...
[02:35:46.640 --> 02:35:49.440]  the l.a. times
[02:35:49.440 --> 02:35:52.880]  and of course he talked and was you know with mcvay for years and before they
[02:35:52.880 --> 02:35:56.800]  even built the terrahood indiana federal execution center he was at the
[02:35:56.800 --> 02:35:58.480]  previous federal facility
[02:35:58.480 --> 02:36:01.000]  uh... where they were holding him up before that and mcvay told him all
[02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:02.320]  this he's written two books
[02:36:02.320 --> 02:36:03.680]  uh... on the subject
[02:36:03.680 --> 02:36:07.520]  uh... margaret roberts a journalist who wrote the preface for hammers two
[02:36:07.520 --> 02:36:08.760]  thousand four book
[02:36:08.760 --> 02:36:11.760]  secrets worth dying for timothy mcvay
[02:36:11.760 --> 02:36:13.560]  and the oklahoma city bombing
[02:36:13.560 --> 02:36:15.440]  uh... we were contacted by him
[02:36:15.440 --> 02:36:18.160]  and so i talked to the law office and others
[02:36:18.160 --> 02:36:20.680]  and they marched into hammer
[02:36:20.680 --> 02:36:24.560]  uh... and we have his whole account now he's been put on lockdown solitary
[02:36:24.560 --> 02:36:25.880]  confinement
[02:36:25.880 --> 02:36:30.920]  uh... they took away uh... his phone privileges where he's allowed to call
[02:36:30.920 --> 02:36:32.840]  that's why you didn't you know here
[02:36:32.840 --> 02:36:35.680]  the background noise of this is a correctional facility because it was
[02:36:35.680 --> 02:36:36.160]  his
[02:36:36.160 --> 02:36:37.440]  private uh...
[02:36:37.440 --> 02:36:41.480]  you know legal call but he was able to get through to us on that system
[02:36:41.480 --> 02:36:45.240]  and uh... this really fell in our lap i mean i knew about hammer
[02:36:45.240 --> 02:36:47.360]  and i knew about the oklahoma city information
[02:36:47.360 --> 02:36:49.960]  and i knew that he'd done an interview a few weeks before
[02:36:49.960 --> 02:36:53.920]  on uh... anti-war radio which is a you know pretty big website
[02:36:53.920 --> 02:36:57.560]  and uh... i i checked into it and there's nothing you know illegal
[02:36:57.560 --> 02:37:00.680]  about interviewing him in fact what they're doing is illegal
[02:37:00.680 --> 02:37:03.320]  under the first amendment i mean i don't want to be arrested disappear into a
[02:37:03.320 --> 02:37:04.360]  black hole and
[02:37:04.360 --> 02:37:06.040]  i can ever get out to the media
[02:37:06.040 --> 02:37:07.960]  but they did come in grabbing
[02:37:07.960 --> 02:37:11.040]  and he is freeing for his life and they told me wanted uh... to take him to an
[02:37:11.040 --> 02:37:12.080]  unscheduled
[02:37:12.080 --> 02:37:13.960]  middle-of-the-night medical exam
[02:37:13.960 --> 02:37:15.600]  uh... but he refused
[02:37:15.600 --> 02:37:18.880]  and you and you do have control of yourself in medical issues
[02:37:18.880 --> 02:37:23.000]  uh... as one of the few rights you still have on death row
[02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:26.520]  and uh... i'm not saying david hammers a perfect person but his whole
[02:37:26.520 --> 02:37:29.360]  his whole story matches with the stuff we already have the info we already
[02:37:29.360 --> 02:37:30.360]  have in triplicate
[02:37:30.360 --> 02:37:31.960]  plus he is on death row for
[02:37:31.960 --> 02:37:33.800]  you know basically
[02:37:33.800 --> 02:37:36.160]  killing somebody in a fight in prison
[02:37:36.160 --> 02:37:39.400]  i'm not saying that's good that uh... you know that's bad he was in prison for
[02:37:39.400 --> 02:37:40.720]  something else and then
[02:37:40.720 --> 02:37:44.880]  uh... went on death row for murder in prison
[02:37:44.880 --> 02:37:47.520]  uh... a very very very serious information
[02:37:47.520 --> 02:37:51.920]  but we have this uh... new development and it's up on info wars dot com key
[02:37:51.920 --> 02:37:54.920]  oklahoma bombing witness denied access
[02:37:54.920 --> 02:37:58.360]  two attorneys fears for his life
[02:37:58.360 --> 02:38:00.680]  by cart nemo and then has the full letter
[02:38:00.680 --> 02:38:01.760]  uh... in here
[02:38:01.760 --> 02:38:04.600]  uh... by david hammer but right now
[02:38:04.600 --> 02:38:07.040]  we're going to go to uh... margaret roberts
[02:38:07.040 --> 02:38:09.640]  has been a key researcher involved in this for years
[02:38:09.640 --> 02:38:13.280]  uh... margaret to have you with us thank you alex it's good to be here i wish it
[02:38:13.280 --> 02:38:15.800]  was under other circumstances
[02:38:15.800 --> 02:38:19.200]  absolutely i don't know how are they keeping him
[02:38:19.200 --> 02:38:22.320]  uh... from talking to the media even though courts are ruling they can't do
[02:38:22.320 --> 02:38:23.000]  this
[02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.440]  well i think what happens is
[02:38:25.440 --> 02:38:27.280]  you know in theory
[02:38:27.280 --> 02:38:29.920]  uh...
[02:38:29.920 --> 02:38:33.680]  if you've been made to allow to have interviews but every time somebody
[02:38:33.680 --> 02:38:37.720]  specifically some reporter uh... or producer
[02:38:37.720 --> 02:38:43.720]  specifically request an interview with hammer it's denied
[02:38:43.720 --> 02:38:45.960]  so it
[02:38:45.960 --> 02:38:51.320]  time and time again uh... he has not been able to speak to the media
[02:38:51.320 --> 02:38:55.240]  now just recapping briefly hammers case said i do that for us because you've
[02:38:55.240 --> 02:38:58.400]  been integral part of the research and then currently
[02:38:58.400 --> 02:39:01.960]  uh... flesh out what's in his letter about the type of uh...
[02:39:01.960 --> 02:39:05.480]  uh... persecution is going through for the information he's put out here because
[02:39:05.480 --> 02:39:07.920]  the feds told him if you won't write this book
[02:39:07.920 --> 02:39:10.280]  about making u.s. government agent
[02:39:10.280 --> 02:39:13.280]  and saying that they were going to stage his death which is what two separate
[02:39:13.280 --> 02:39:15.160]  reporters said at the time he was still
[02:39:15.160 --> 02:39:17.960]  breathing when they pay was brought out when he was executed
[02:39:17.960 --> 02:39:21.280]  uh... i mean he doesn't have any motive to be doing this except that he is
[02:39:21.280 --> 02:39:22.200]  telling the truth
[02:39:22.200 --> 02:39:27.360]  uh... yeah i think he really doesn't have a motive you you see hammers day
[02:39:27.360 --> 02:39:29.600]  you know i'm gonna die in prison
[02:39:29.600 --> 02:39:33.480]  uh... and actually alex the the reason i
[02:39:33.480 --> 02:39:37.600]  uh... agreed to write the preface i actually wrote the preface for this new
[02:39:37.600 --> 02:39:38.360]  book
[02:39:38.360 --> 02:39:39.720]  deadly secrets
[02:39:39.720 --> 02:39:44.880]  and the reason i did that was that as a journalist uh... you know i knew very
[02:39:44.880 --> 02:39:46.320]  well that
[02:39:46.320 --> 02:39:48.640]  credibility was going to be
[02:39:48.640 --> 02:39:52.320]  the issue for david hammer and i've been following your
[02:39:52.320 --> 02:39:56.360]  website here this morning and i think that this is kicked up quite a lot of
[02:39:56.360 --> 02:40:00.800]  uh... of noise and people are rightly saying why should we believe this guy on
[02:40:00.800 --> 02:40:02.080]  death row
[02:40:02.080 --> 02:40:05.040]  uh... as i wrote in my preface i
[02:40:05.040 --> 02:40:07.440]  as a reporter in chicago i broke up
[02:40:07.440 --> 02:40:11.920]  a big story way back in the nineteen eighties about uh... an innocent prisoner
[02:40:11.920 --> 02:40:15.800]  on death row and he was proved to be innocent and the real killers were
[02:40:15.800 --> 02:40:17.280]  were
[02:40:17.280 --> 02:40:19.440]  discovered and he walked free
[02:40:19.440 --> 02:40:22.160]  and to me the lesson was
[02:40:22.160 --> 02:40:26.680]  uh... yes you have to exercise great scrutiny when you
[02:40:26.680 --> 02:40:29.520]  examine a story that's coming off death row
[02:40:29.520 --> 02:40:31.160]  but at the same time
[02:40:31.160 --> 02:40:34.320]  alex the truth can come off death row
[02:40:34.320 --> 02:40:37.360]  though that that was the lesson there for me
[02:40:37.360 --> 02:40:38.600]  uh...
[02:40:38.600 --> 02:40:43.200]  i uh... was uh... producer for america's most wanted
[02:40:43.200 --> 02:40:47.720]  and in nineteen uh... two thousand five started looking into this
[02:40:47.720 --> 02:40:51.640]  uh... oklahoma city bombing from the fugitive aspect john doe number two i
[02:40:51.640 --> 02:40:53.680]  know you've covered and covered that
[02:40:53.680 --> 02:40:54.720]  uh...
[02:40:54.720 --> 02:40:56.600]  that's when i ran into
[02:40:56.600 --> 02:40:58.720]  jesse trinidad and
[02:40:58.720 --> 02:40:59.980]  david hammer's
[02:40:59.980 --> 02:41:01.140]  um...
[02:41:01.140 --> 02:41:03.800]  interviews with timothy mcvay
[02:41:03.800 --> 02:41:05.280]  and uh... the
[02:41:05.280 --> 02:41:07.000]  the possibility that
[02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.720]  jesse trinidad's brother kenneth who was
[02:41:09.720 --> 02:41:11.000]  uh... mysterious
[02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:11.520]  uh...
[02:41:11.520 --> 02:41:12.200]  prison
[02:41:12.200 --> 02:41:14.040]  suicide and quotation marks
[02:41:14.040 --> 02:41:17.960]  but he may have been linked to the bombing so that's how i became involved
[02:41:17.960 --> 02:41:19.960]  in in this research
[02:41:19.960 --> 02:41:21.680]  and through it
[02:41:21.680 --> 02:41:25.800]  uh... now for several years have watched as
[02:41:25.800 --> 02:41:28.760]  jesse trinidad and david hammer
[02:41:28.760 --> 02:41:31.160]  have collaborated and then david
[02:41:31.160 --> 02:41:32.280]  you know it has
[02:41:32.280 --> 02:41:34.640]  been off on his own path and
[02:41:34.640 --> 02:41:37.680]  find it very impressive
[02:41:37.680 --> 02:41:42.200]  uh... what david has synthesized from his own researches
[02:41:42.200 --> 02:41:43.240]  conducted
[02:41:43.240 --> 02:41:47.560]  uh... from all places his cell and death row
[02:41:47.560 --> 02:41:51.000]  as well as covering what jesse's done what the
[02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:54.720]  excellent uh... investigative reporter jb kass did
[02:41:54.720 --> 02:41:56.120]  did too so
[02:41:56.120 --> 02:41:59.560]  uh... and through this period alex
[02:41:59.560 --> 02:42:01.240]  hammer
[02:42:01.240 --> 02:42:02.200]  has been
[02:42:02.200 --> 02:42:05.680]  volunteering to step forward and tell his story
[02:42:05.680 --> 02:42:09.480]  i noticed that one of your writers to the website this morning
[02:42:09.480 --> 02:42:13.600]  was commenting on the demeanor the tenor of
[02:42:13.600 --> 02:42:17.600]  hammer's presentation to you in that at the excellent hour-long interview you
[02:42:17.600 --> 02:42:19.840]  did last week
[02:42:19.840 --> 02:42:24.120]  the the human voice tells a lot about credibility that's all hammer has ever
[02:42:24.120 --> 02:42:27.080]  asked to do is to step forward and tell his story
[02:42:27.080 --> 02:42:31.720]  but the fb i have thought to and nail all the way up to
[02:42:31.720 --> 02:42:34.080]  uh... federal appellate court
[02:42:34.080 --> 02:42:35.880]  to shut hammer up
[02:42:35.880 --> 02:42:39.440]  and i think any reasonable mind would have to ask
[02:42:39.440 --> 02:42:42.080]  fifteen years after the fact
[02:42:42.080 --> 02:42:44.840]  why is that so important
[02:42:44.840 --> 02:42:48.840]  you not allow a man to tell a story
[02:42:48.840 --> 02:42:50.760]  well even more than that
[02:42:50.760 --> 02:42:54.080]  uh... certainly there's a cover-up going on and and their and and their fighting
[02:42:54.080 --> 02:42:56.120]  very hard to continue it
[02:42:56.120 --> 02:42:58.720]  but everything he's been saying
[02:42:58.720 --> 02:42:59.960]  years later
[02:42:59.960 --> 02:43:02.000]  which is trying to do is lawsuits
[02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:03.720]  comes out in
[02:43:03.720 --> 02:43:05.800]  federal documents comes out
[02:43:05.800 --> 02:43:06.800]  in major
[02:43:06.800 --> 02:43:10.840]  newspapers it comes out that the feds were basically running alohim said he
[02:43:10.840 --> 02:43:14.280]  that there were warnings that the head of the fb i anti-terrorism
[02:43:14.280 --> 02:43:17.360]  group was there the week before in the day of the event
[02:43:17.360 --> 02:43:19.800]  and lied about he wasn't in dallas
[02:43:19.800 --> 02:43:21.720]  absolutely list goes on and on
[02:43:21.720 --> 02:43:25.280]  and and this was a government operation separate
[02:43:25.280 --> 02:43:27.560]  from what anything hammer says
[02:43:27.560 --> 02:43:30.480]  uh... it it's just incredible
[02:43:30.480 --> 02:43:34.680]  uh... the amount of evidence from all your research uh... what's the bottom
[02:43:34.680 --> 02:43:37.000]  line of oklahoma city
[02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:40.400]  well you know every reporter every journalist always has a working
[02:43:40.400 --> 02:43:42.480]  theory
[02:43:42.480 --> 02:43:43.400]  i
[02:43:43.400 --> 02:43:47.400]  and which is subject to change the more you learn the more you know
[02:43:47.400 --> 02:43:52.000]  but i think a very important dot that hammer connect and by the way
[02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:52.840]  if i may
[02:43:52.840 --> 02:43:55.720]  state share for your view for your listeners
[02:43:55.720 --> 02:43:58.360]  this book is only available
[02:43:58.360 --> 02:43:59.520]  one place
[02:43:59.520 --> 02:44:00.640]  the website
[02:44:00.640 --> 02:44:01.720]  for the publisher
[02:44:01.720 --> 02:44:07.200]  w w w dot author house dot com that's the only place you can can read this
[02:44:07.200 --> 02:44:08.320]  book
[02:44:08.320 --> 02:44:12.500]  my working theory based upon my own research and watching
[02:44:12.500 --> 02:44:15.560]  what hammer and jesse trynna do have developed
[02:44:15.560 --> 02:44:20.120]  and i think this is a dot that hammer connect a very important one alex
[02:44:20.120 --> 02:44:22.120]  is
[02:44:22.120 --> 02:44:24.560]  use of criminal
[02:44:24.560 --> 02:44:28.040]  criminals as informants
[02:44:28.040 --> 02:44:31.880]  reporting directly to federal law enforcement
[02:44:31.880 --> 02:44:33.800]  uh... i think that's going to be
[02:44:33.800 --> 02:44:38.200]  a major element of this story once the whole story is told
[02:44:38.200 --> 02:44:39.920]  as hammer points out
[02:44:39.920 --> 02:44:40.960]  most
[02:44:40.960 --> 02:44:47.400]  virtually all of the members of this area republican army bank robbery gang
[02:44:47.400 --> 02:44:50.560]  that timothy mcbay fingered as his
[02:44:50.560 --> 02:44:56.000]  on the ground support squad in oklahoma city on april nineteen virtually every
[02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:57.160]  one of them
[02:44:57.160 --> 02:45:01.640]  at one time or another before during or after the oklahoma city bombing
[02:45:01.640 --> 02:45:04.680]  with functioning
[02:45:04.680 --> 02:45:05.280]  a
[02:45:05.280 --> 02:45:09.280]  a criminal informant to federal law enforcement well we know the feds do
[02:45:09.280 --> 02:45:13.080]  this everywhere they'll have a convicted uh... arsonist uh...
[02:45:13.080 --> 02:45:15.240]  child molester bank robber
[02:45:15.240 --> 02:45:17.720]  and then they'll be used in court against people who don't even have a
[02:45:17.720 --> 02:45:19.840]  criminal record so here's the government saying
[02:45:19.840 --> 02:45:21.440]  don't listen to david hammer
[02:45:21.440 --> 02:45:23.400]  he's a convict on death row
[02:45:23.400 --> 02:45:25.160]  but then listen to all of our
[02:45:25.160 --> 02:45:26.560]  criminal informants
[02:45:26.560 --> 02:45:29.800]  that we're using and then when they're clean criminal informant
[02:45:29.800 --> 02:45:31.400]  uh... howl
[02:45:31.400 --> 02:45:34.240]  was inside elaheem city and came out and said they're going to blow up the
[02:45:34.240 --> 02:45:35.200]  federal building
[02:45:35.200 --> 02:45:36.720]  they indicted her
[02:45:36.720 --> 02:45:40.520]  just to shut her up because one agency didn't know what the other agency was
[02:45:40.520 --> 02:45:41.160]  doing
[02:45:41.160 --> 02:45:43.280]  but finishing up with that we need to talk about
[02:45:43.280 --> 02:45:45.240]  mister hammer what we know about
[02:45:45.240 --> 02:45:48.440]  uh... him now being uh... uh... basically punished
[02:45:48.440 --> 02:45:51.280]  uh... and his letter that made it out and have we heard anything else from
[02:45:51.280 --> 02:45:56.840]  him actually yes i'm happy to say alex that this morning uh... i have had
[02:45:56.840 --> 02:45:59.120]  another email from hammer he
[02:45:59.120 --> 02:46:00.160]  remains
[02:46:00.160 --> 02:46:05.360]  uh... extremely concerned about what is to come obviously this
[02:46:05.360 --> 02:46:07.320]  uh... disciplinary
[02:46:07.320 --> 02:46:11.880]  you know procedure will go forward how heavy it's going to be is
[02:46:11.880 --> 02:46:13.920]  is unknown so far
[02:46:13.920 --> 02:46:15.880]  as you know in the
[02:46:15.880 --> 02:46:20.080]  email he sent yesterday which you posted on your website
[02:46:20.080 --> 02:46:22.440]  you know he he was
[02:46:22.440 --> 02:46:26.400]  you know fearing that it was going to be heavy consequences
[02:46:26.400 --> 02:46:31.800]  and was expecting that all of his communications would be shut down so far
[02:46:31.800 --> 02:46:34.320]  uh... that has not happened
[02:46:34.320 --> 02:46:36.280]  uh... his plea was
[02:46:36.280 --> 02:46:37.320]  you know
[02:46:37.320 --> 02:46:38.880]  uh... if if
[02:46:38.880 --> 02:46:43.080]  this makes sense to people out there if he is representing the story in the
[02:46:43.080 --> 02:46:45.160]  continuing research effort
[02:46:45.160 --> 02:46:50.720]  you know he was encouraging people to be in touch with uh... the prison
[02:46:50.720 --> 02:46:55.440]  if i may say if i may add alex one of the amazing uh...
[02:46:55.440 --> 02:47:00.040]  well not so amazing to me as i come out of the america's most wanted enterprise
[02:47:00.040 --> 02:47:03.120]  which i i worked for for some years
[02:47:03.120 --> 02:47:06.760]  the the information that is starting to serve it
[02:47:06.760 --> 02:47:11.840]  through you know your listeners we've had you know it very interesting emails
[02:47:11.840 --> 02:47:14.200]  factual informational emails
[02:47:14.200 --> 02:47:15.120]  uh...
[02:47:15.120 --> 02:47:19.120]  just continuing to add you know clues and leads to this
[02:47:19.120 --> 02:47:24.000]  this is what could be the tipping point of this entire investigation
[02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:25.760]  is that if
[02:47:25.760 --> 02:47:28.600]  david hammer has shaken the tree here
[02:47:28.600 --> 02:47:31.520]  to bring information in and as you have
[02:47:31.520 --> 02:47:32.200]  you know
[02:47:32.200 --> 02:47:33.520]  uh... had the
[02:47:33.520 --> 02:47:38.160]  uh... the the courage to you know get on the air and really give this a hearing
[02:47:38.160 --> 02:47:39.240]  uh...
[02:47:39.240 --> 02:47:40.000]  let's
[02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:41.400]  let's all that
[02:47:41.400 --> 02:47:45.520]  you know that's basically what hammer says in his book let's all that and
[02:47:45.520 --> 02:47:46.800]  there are more
[02:47:46.800 --> 02:47:49.120]  very important moments just
[02:47:49.120 --> 02:47:51.760]  just down the horizon and one of them is
[02:47:51.760 --> 02:47:53.920]  jessie trinitus fight over these
[02:47:53.920 --> 02:47:57.040]  surveillance tape and why is the fb i
[02:47:57.040 --> 02:47:59.600]  again fighting tooth and nail
[02:47:59.600 --> 02:48:01.840]  to keep these pictures secret
[02:48:01.840 --> 02:48:04.160]  uh... you asked me what is my theory
[02:48:04.160 --> 02:48:05.200]  i think
[02:48:05.200 --> 02:48:09.000]  the videotape that the fb i is still holding
[02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.320]  is going to show us pictures
[02:48:11.320 --> 02:48:12.400]  of people
[02:48:12.400 --> 02:48:16.440]  who were with timothy mcbay on them on the morning of
[02:48:16.440 --> 02:48:18.840]  four nineteen ninety five
[02:48:18.840 --> 02:48:20.880]  and i think those pictures will be
[02:48:20.880 --> 02:48:23.160]  revelatory as to
[02:48:23.160 --> 02:48:24.680]  the potential
[02:48:24.680 --> 02:48:29.680]  uh... you know government involvement in some way or other for fifteen years
[02:48:29.680 --> 02:48:32.400]  they've been declaring national security on all those different videotapes
[02:48:32.400 --> 02:48:34.080]  that we do have the witnesses
[02:48:34.080 --> 02:48:36.040]  that day in the days before
[02:48:36.040 --> 02:48:38.680]  who did see mcbay all over the building
[02:48:38.680 --> 02:48:43.440]  uh... in the a tf offices you name and i mean these are credible people
[02:48:43.440 --> 02:48:46.400]  who who are on record that work there and who saw him
[02:48:46.400 --> 02:48:49.520]  yes i think you back all of this
[02:48:49.520 --> 02:48:54.160]  exactly back to that and to to your listeners who are
[02:48:54.160 --> 02:48:57.560]  are kind of shouting don't listen to david hammer
[02:48:57.560 --> 02:49:00.440]  i would just say remember
[02:49:00.440 --> 02:49:03.400]  you know more than a dozen honest
[02:49:03.400 --> 02:49:04.920]  witnesses
[02:49:04.920 --> 02:49:07.480]  in oklahoma in kansas
[02:49:07.480 --> 02:49:10.760]  war they thought john doe number two
[02:49:10.760 --> 02:49:13.080]  with timothy mcbay
[02:49:13.080 --> 02:49:17.480]  and who was that man
[02:49:17.480 --> 02:49:20.760]  just incredible uh... you know i want to get you back for a full hour in the near
[02:49:20.760 --> 02:49:24.400]  future to really go over oklahoma city from your perspective because we can't
[02:49:24.400 --> 02:49:25.240]  just do it
[02:49:25.240 --> 02:49:27.560]  i'd be so glad to do that and i was
[02:49:27.560 --> 02:49:28.280]  so
[02:49:28.280 --> 02:49:33.880]  uh... it was a tremendous interview you did alex you brought you know this was
[02:49:33.880 --> 02:49:34.880]  the fight
[02:49:34.880 --> 02:49:38.680]  to keep this silent and you brought this story out
[02:49:38.680 --> 02:49:44.040]  and people did hear david hammer in his own words and i i thought he was
[02:49:44.040 --> 02:49:46.320]  persuasive
[02:49:46.320 --> 02:49:49.240]  uh... no so did my family and friends that hurt it but again if you really
[02:49:49.240 --> 02:49:52.160]  researched the info you know how persuasive because he was saying a lot
[02:49:52.160 --> 02:49:54.320]  of these things before it ever even came out
[02:49:54.320 --> 02:49:56.640]  and a lot of this has now been confirmed
[02:49:56.640 --> 02:49:58.960]  uh... through the lawsuits of jessie trinidad
[02:49:58.960 --> 02:50:02.400]  uh... in the federal court a margaret roberts is there a website or
[02:50:02.400 --> 02:50:05.760]  uh... some personal site folks can visit of yours or is it

[02:54:33.200 --> 02:54:39.800]  hi Alex I think you're Alex I'm I just a military police and I just want to call
[02:54:39.800 --> 02:54:46.800]  a comment on the open the phone lines you had today and you know I see a pattern
[02:54:46.800 --> 02:54:51.120]  emerging and I have actually for the past few months you know we have training
[02:54:51.120 --> 02:54:56.640]  days where I'm at about twice every month and one of the same one of the
[02:54:56.640 --> 02:55:01.200]  things is that at the beginning of the training day and beginning the training
[02:55:01.200 --> 02:55:07.680]  period the very first thing they always breeze over is martial law and the
[02:55:07.680 --> 02:55:11.760]  difference between qualified and absolute martial law and also the fourth
[02:55:11.760 --> 02:55:16.720]  fifth sixth amendments and the project how to fact and he's somewhat of crimes
[02:55:16.720 --> 02:55:23.960]  act and you know we're gonna be meant to us and you know from what I'm my own
[02:55:23.960 --> 02:55:28.720]  experience I've been in the military you know for almost four years I've never
[02:55:28.720 --> 02:55:33.680]  been trained confiscate weapons you know except for in instances where it's a
[02:55:33.680 --> 02:55:39.800]  search illegal I illegally authorized search and but they said that in New
[02:55:39.800 --> 02:55:46.160]  Orleans they said we say it's legal go get their guns yep and I'm saying you're
[02:55:46.160 --> 02:55:49.520]  saying that they now I mean this is new though I mean I mean correct me if I'm
[02:55:49.520 --> 02:55:54.160]  wrong before I what I got from what you said is that this is new now that
[02:55:54.160 --> 02:55:58.440]  suddenly at the start of the drills they they describe different variants or
[02:55:58.440 --> 02:56:06.600]  different threat continuums different does escalations of martial law yes
[02:56:06.600 --> 02:56:10.880]  that's true but also the longer pointing I don't believe the military will
[02:56:10.880 --> 02:56:15.960]  actually confiscate weapons willingly I mean I'm not a member of both keepers
[02:56:15.960 --> 02:56:21.060]  but I do support them and I will keep my oath to the Constitution I will not
[02:56:21.060 --> 02:56:25.320]  confiscate weapons well that's good news sir what about other members of your
[02:56:25.320 --> 02:56:29.040]  unit what's their view on average you know what percent would you dead reckon
[02:56:29.040 --> 02:56:33.720]  have your view versus the other view a and then be what I mean what how do they
[02:56:33.720 --> 02:56:39.000]  describe martial law to you well you know I don't think that many many members
[02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:43.440]  of my unit personally will actually follow an order to confiscate weapons
[02:56:43.440 --> 02:56:48.360]  because they recognize no every American has a second member right and they
[02:56:48.360 --> 02:56:50.560]  would if they were in that position they wouldn't want their weapons
[02:56:50.560 --> 02:56:56.120]  confiscated either you know and I mean the military in general you know I will
[02:56:56.120 --> 02:56:59.440]  I will agree that you know there are those that are hard chargers and will
[02:56:59.440 --> 02:57:03.280]  follow whatever orders they're given but um you know with branches service
[02:57:03.280 --> 02:57:07.320]  I mean we're we're almost caught the question orders at all that sure well
[02:57:07.320 --> 02:57:11.920]  that's the catch 22 with police and military they know guns aren't the
[02:57:11.920 --> 02:57:15.840]  boogeyman the media says they are so you've got these global communists
[02:57:15.840 --> 02:57:20.240]  basically trying to demonize guns but the military knows all about guns and
[02:57:20.240 --> 02:57:28.120]  they love guns they're not going to buy it that's right that's right and so
[02:57:28.120 --> 02:57:31.320]  personally I don't I don't just need military coming in and confiscating
[02:57:31.320 --> 02:57:36.480]  weapons but you know I agree with the comment which is that earlier that made
[02:57:36.480 --> 02:57:41.040]  some will follow orders multiple question orders I personally I won't
[02:57:41.040 --> 02:57:44.560]  confiscate any weapons I don't think any members of my would do the same thing
[02:57:44.560 --> 02:57:47.280]  okay so what are they saying though now that they're suddenly telling you about
[02:57:47.280 --> 02:57:52.120]  martial law well this is just an emerging pattern that I've seen over the
[02:57:52.120 --> 02:57:58.160]  past six or seven months and um you know when they talk about martial law it's
[02:57:58.160 --> 02:58:01.480]  always gonna be the difference it's been qualified in absolute martial law and
[02:58:01.480 --> 02:58:08.440]  they give us that definition well qualified martial law is where there's
[02:58:08.440 --> 02:58:13.800]  a national emergency or natural disaster like Katrina for example the
[02:58:13.800 --> 02:58:19.600]  local court system was still in place and still had authority in the military
[02:58:19.600 --> 02:58:24.720]  basically just came in to assist backup what's the other type of martial law it's
[02:58:24.720 --> 02:58:27.920]  absolute martial laws where the military takes control essentially over the
[02:58:27.920 --> 02:58:32.000]  court system over the police and has final authority and say over about
[02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:38.560]  everything and are you banter are you being trained for that I wouldn't say we
[02:58:38.560 --> 02:58:44.000]  are but we stay there stay there one minute stay there thank you for listening
[02:58:44.000 --> 02:58:53.680]  to GCN visit GCNLive.com today the question is where should the American
[02:58:53.680 --> 02:58:59.520]  people draw their line in the sand what have we got a republic or a monarchy a
[02:58:59.520 --> 02:59:03.360]  republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights not
[02:59:03.360 --> 02:59:07.720]  democracy not mob rule two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner so they
[02:59:07.720 --> 02:59:11.080]  think they own our land they think they're on our water children our
[02:59:11.080 --> 02:59:16.640]  education our money we have to define who we are and what we will tolerate
[02:59:16.640 --> 02:59:22.480]  somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot uprising we have the
[02:59:22.480 --> 02:59:25.880]  facts we have the Constitution we have the Bill of Rights we have common law
[02:59:25.880 --> 02:59:29.840]  knowledge is power ladies and gentlemen and I'm so excited to be able to offer

[02:59:56.000 --> 03:00:01.160]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[03:00:05.280 --> 03:00:09.120]  well this is extremely ominous not only do we have all the mainstream news
[03:00:09.120 --> 03:00:12.240]  articles and I've interviewed the colonels involved with open gun
[03:00:12.240 --> 03:00:18.920]  confiscation drills in places like Iowa not only do we have all these czars in
[03:00:18.920 --> 03:00:21.800]  the White House and the new Supreme Court nominee calling for an end of free
[03:00:21.800 --> 03:00:28.080]  speech secret arrest of citizens by the Pentagon this is this is conditioning
[03:00:28.080 --> 03:00:32.280]  Preston calls in from Japan and we know this is confirmed under Northcom they
[03:00:32.280 --> 03:00:35.760]  admit their training for open martial law absolute martial law under
[03:00:35.760 --> 03:00:40.720]  infrastructure protection continuity of government COG but suddenly the last
[03:00:40.720 --> 03:00:44.760]  seven months he's been in for four years and he's in Japan they're teaching
[03:00:44.760 --> 03:00:51.600]  him you know the the the baby martial law where they just help in an emergency
[03:00:51.600 --> 03:00:57.560]  versus total takeover of society but again now they're training them for both
[03:00:57.560 --> 03:01:03.080]  types finish up your statement on that I mean is that creep you out Preston
[03:01:03.080 --> 03:01:09.720]  that suddenly they're they're they're teaching you about full bore martial law
[03:01:09.720 --> 03:01:13.840]  I won't say it creeps me out because I first learned about all this in bootcamp
[03:01:13.840 --> 03:01:18.560]  and I mean most military members always talk about this in bootcamp but you
[03:01:18.560 --> 03:01:23.400]  know depending on their job what they do they'll necessarily go over the
[03:01:23.400 --> 03:01:28.440]  to review this as much as they like the police do like we do so but I have
[03:01:28.440 --> 03:01:31.720]  noticed like I said notice an increasing trend that you know it's just like the
[03:01:31.720 --> 03:01:36.400]  nail hitting on the head continually over and over again as being I would once
[03:01:36.400 --> 03:01:40.040]  they've beaten into us but we're reminded of it you know at least twice a
[03:01:40.040 --> 03:01:47.240]  month and we have been taught in how to help implement that and what our
[03:01:47.240 --> 03:01:52.120]  positions would be and are they saying under total martial law that they're
[03:01:52.120 --> 03:01:56.440]  gonna go after the guns because in the drills that they're having they are
[03:01:56.440 --> 03:01:59.920]  you know cordoning neighborhoods and going door-to-door and we have
[03:01:59.920 --> 03:02:04.360]  connecting New York mayor we have the disgrace governor Blagojevic last year
[03:02:04.360 --> 03:02:07.880]  before he got kicked out saying I want the National Guard here to confiscate
[03:02:07.880 --> 03:02:11.880]  guns I mean you know Marines running checkpoints looking for drunk drivers I
[03:02:11.880 --> 03:02:16.800]  mean they're certainly acclimating right now yes they are I'll agree with that
[03:02:16.800 --> 03:02:22.360]  definitely but as far as my use my unit goes we are not being actively taught
[03:02:22.360 --> 03:02:27.640]  how to confiscate weapons and I've never been and not in the past four years my
[03:02:27.640 --> 03:02:31.800]  entire military career I've never been taught how to confiscate weapons except
[03:02:31.800 --> 03:02:39.440]  for a lawful search and you know I mean so I can definitely see how there is
[03:02:39.440 --> 03:02:45.720]  ramping up and for all the services and I talked to other services and their
[03:02:45.720 --> 03:02:50.320]  military police units I have several friends of them and you know it's the
[03:02:50.320 --> 03:02:55.320]  same with them too they're they're having the same kind of ramp up well I
[03:02:55.320 --> 03:03:01.560]  talked to my cousin and he said they're even training you know the mechanics
[03:03:01.560 --> 03:03:08.200]  in riot control in the National Guard now and you know he's always been in the
[03:03:08.200 --> 03:03:12.680]  military regular army and now he's a regular army liaison to the National
[03:03:12.680 --> 03:03:19.280]  Guard and he won't really talk about it but he just shakes his head he just
[03:03:19.280 --> 03:03:25.360]  says I'm not because he's an officer he just says Alex you have no idea and so
[03:03:25.360 --> 03:03:29.000]  I think that's where you really see it is in the is these units that are
[03:03:29.000 --> 03:03:34.760]  crossover big army National Guard in the states you're right you know we do have
[03:03:34.760 --> 03:03:39.600]  something called auxiliary security forces they have an old military
[03:03:39.600 --> 03:03:44.520]  jobs and whether the mechanic or they work on aircraft or they work on tanks
[03:03:44.520 --> 03:03:48.320]  or whatever the deal may be and they will come in augment and supplement us
[03:03:48.320 --> 03:03:53.360]  up and kind of time and they receive the same training as well run out of time
[03:03:53.360 --> 03:03:57.800]  and I appreciate your call but just to throw this last question in I mean are
[03:03:57.800 --> 03:04:01.280]  you guys having discussions of why this is suddenly happening I mean are you
[03:04:01.280 --> 03:04:06.560]  sent I mean I would guess it's about the financial collapse or I mean what are

[03:08:23.680 --> 03:08:28.720]  balance of this radio broadcast the next 52 minutes Dr. Edwin Vieira joins us
[03:08:28.720 --> 03:08:34.040]  and we're gonna be talking about the Bill of Rights the Constitution this
[03:08:34.040 --> 03:08:40.240]  Imperial federal government the open unprecedented assaults on the core of the
[03:08:40.240 --> 03:08:45.000]  Bill of Rights the preparations for martial law in this country with Dr.
[03:08:45.000 --> 03:08:50.560]  Edwin Vieira so we're gonna get to Bud and Ed and others who are military to
[03:08:50.560 --> 03:08:54.640]  comment on the type of training they've been given or comments they have on the
[03:08:54.640 --> 03:08:59.040]  military saying no to this oathkeepers has now got an interview with a sergeant
[03:08:59.040 --> 03:09:02.880]  who was involved in Katrina and he said that upwards of half or even more but he
[03:09:02.880 --> 03:09:07.000]  saw about half of them say we're not gonna be in formation saying we're not
[03:09:07.000 --> 03:09:10.480]  taking part in gun confiscation and that really shut the whole thing down
[03:09:10.480 --> 03:09:15.400]  though they had ABC News and CBS and Fox running around with teams of military
[03:09:15.400 --> 03:09:21.720]  the regular army that were doing it we played those videos last hour but Dr.
[03:09:21.720 --> 03:09:28.560]  Edwin Vieira holds four degrees from Harvard Harvard College AM and PhD
[03:09:28.560 --> 03:09:32.760]  Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences JD Harvard Law School and he's
[03:09:32.760 --> 03:09:36.240]  won cases at the Supreme Court of I tried to read his bio and give it going
[03:09:36.240 --> 03:09:40.880]  forever but his most recent work on money and banking is the two volume pieces
[03:09:40.880 --> 03:09:46.160]  of eight monetary powers and disabilities the United States Constitution and you
[03:09:46.160 --> 03:09:49.520]  can read his great articles at newswithviews.com we'll tell you more
[03:09:49.520 --> 03:09:52.720]  about his books and materials I believe he's written another book since then and
[03:09:52.720 --> 03:09:55.960]  he's also started a movement to really take back the states and he's a big part
[03:09:55.960 --> 03:09:59.840]  of the film I consulted on and I'm also in don't tread on me rise of the
[03:09:59.840 --> 03:10:03.520]  Republic you want solutions the difference between a republic and a
[03:10:03.520 --> 03:10:07.960]  democracy the 9th and 10th amendment the second amendment the militias the
[03:10:07.960 --> 03:10:12.120]  power of the sheriff sheriff max in here don't tread on me rise the Republic
[03:10:12.120 --> 03:10:16.240]  available at info wars.com and we've been authorized to post it for the first time
[03:10:16.240 --> 03:10:21.320]  ever on the web it was just released yesterday on DVD at prisonplanet.tv and
[03:10:21.320 --> 03:10:27.120]  that will be up this evening for prisonplanet.tv members Dr. Edwin Vieira
[03:10:27.120 --> 03:10:30.760]  before we get into the Supreme Court what's happening there you were on hold
[03:10:30.760 --> 03:10:35.000]  listening to that MP officer talking about suddenly they're being trained
[03:10:35.000 --> 03:10:39.560]  about the different types of martial law what's that sound like to you well
[03:10:39.560 --> 03:10:43.200]  this goes back a fair ways Alex of course because they've been anticipating
[03:10:43.200 --> 03:10:47.440]  for a long time based on what they understand to be the inherent
[03:10:47.440 --> 03:10:51.000]  stability of this monetary and banking system that we're going to be in for a
[03:10:51.000 --> 03:10:55.120]  great deal of economic chaos if you will not simply crisis but chaos and that
[03:10:55.120 --> 03:10:59.400]  will obviously lead to social dislocations political unrest I mean
[03:10:59.400 --> 03:11:03.840]  imagine things like the Watts riots or the Los Angeles riots most people are
[03:11:03.840 --> 03:11:08.080]  familiar with with that in recent history or what happened in Argentina as a
[03:11:08.080 --> 03:11:11.520]  good example and at the turn of the 20th century and they had a couple of
[03:11:11.520 --> 03:11:17.280]  events like that earlier I think that's what the powers that be are looking
[03:11:17.280 --> 03:11:20.440]  towards and they probably don't believe I certainly don't believe that they're
[03:11:20.440 --> 03:11:25.280]  capable of finessing the difficulties they're having with the federal reserve
[03:11:25.280 --> 03:11:29.440]  currency and the debt level of the federal government so forth and so on so
[03:11:29.440 --> 03:11:33.240]  they're anticipating this will happen they know that they don't have enough
[03:11:33.240 --> 03:11:37.480]  as expression goes boots on the ground within the local and state police
[03:11:37.480 --> 03:11:42.000]  forces so this means they have to turn to the National Guard the regular army
[03:11:42.000 --> 03:11:48.000]  to try and maintain their version of social order and that's where the whole
[03:11:48.000 --> 03:11:52.360]  concept of martial law comes in and of course the training that follows from
[03:11:52.360 --> 03:11:56.000]  that of course your deep research in papers and books you've written on it
[03:11:56.000 --> 03:12:00.080]  have been seminal roadmaps Ron Paul has quoted them as seminal roadmaps in his
[03:12:00.080 --> 03:12:03.840]  research that if they wanted real homeland security it would spring from
[03:12:03.840 --> 03:12:10.600]  the state and the county and would be the bona fide militia of 1789 well if
[03:12:10.600 --> 03:12:14.560]  you go to the Constitution you look for the word security where do you find it
[03:12:14.560 --> 03:12:17.840]  the only place that exists is in the Second Amendment a well-regulated
[03:12:17.840 --> 03:12:22.320]  militia being necessary to the security of a free state and it's not just
[03:12:22.320 --> 03:12:26.400]  security for security's sake it's security for this concept called a free
[03:12:26.400 --> 03:12:30.440]  state which is what the entire Constitution is intended to uphold and
[03:12:30.440 --> 03:12:34.480]  that's certainly not what most people today thought myself would call a
[03:12:34.480 --> 03:12:38.640]  martial law something entirely different and it's tied to this institution
[03:12:38.640 --> 03:12:43.960]  called a well-regulated militia and if you want to know what that is you put
[03:12:43.960 --> 03:12:49.480]  yourself back in the context of the founding fathers most of whom if they
[03:12:49.480 --> 03:12:53.880]  were the founding fathers by definition being males most of whom had served or
[03:12:53.880 --> 03:12:58.960]  were then members of various state militias that put trace back their
[03:12:58.960 --> 03:13:04.320]  history into the 1600s you can find all of the principles for the organization of
[03:13:04.320 --> 03:13:07.720]  a well-regulated militia and just hundreds of these statutes that were
[03:13:07.720 --> 03:13:11.920]  passed in the 13 colonies of an independent states prior to the
[03:13:11.920 --> 03:13:15.400]  ratification of the Constitution. And to interrupt the the the democrats
[03:13:15.400 --> 03:13:20.040]  especially but also Republicans argue no that means well-regulated military but
[03:13:20.040 --> 03:13:26.080]  it says the people I mean they're in the Second Amendment it says the people the
[03:13:26.080 --> 03:13:31.120]  rights of the people I mean clearly it's it's a hundred percent defined as this
[03:13:31.120 --> 03:13:36.240]  militia for our security is the people and of course if everybody's got guns
[03:13:36.240 --> 03:13:40.040]  it knows how to use them most people aren't criminals you're gonna have a
[03:13:40.040 --> 03:13:46.040]  very free and safe society and a polite society. Of course the Second Amendment
[03:13:46.040 --> 03:13:50.760]  in a sense is redone there because if you look at these militia statutes which
[03:13:50.760 --> 03:13:54.880]  define what those people considered to be a well-regulated militia what are
[03:13:54.880 --> 03:13:59.720]  those militias consist of? Well at the time it was every able-bodied free man
[03:13:59.720 --> 03:14:05.720]  from 16 to 55 or 60 when you became too old to function anymore. Of course they
[03:14:05.720 --> 03:14:08.880]  had slaves and the women were not legally emancipated so it was limited at
[03:14:08.880 --> 03:14:13.280]  that time to men we might have a slight change in that composition but the idea
[03:14:13.280 --> 03:14:17.960]  was it was the organization of the entire community but we're supposed to
[03:14:17.960 --> 03:14:22.320]  have a self-governing republic in each one of the states Republican form of
[03:14:22.320 --> 03:14:26.800]  government and a self-governing community involves everyone participating to some
[03:14:26.800 --> 03:14:31.240]  degree literally having a duty to participate in the governmental
[03:14:31.240 --> 03:14:35.200]  structure as the Constitution tells us in the Second Amendment the key element
[03:14:35.200 --> 03:14:39.920]  to maintaining this free state this Republican form of government is what a
[03:14:39.920 --> 03:14:45.080]  well-regulated militia which consists of whom? The people. So this whole idea that
[03:14:45.080 --> 03:14:48.800]  the National Guard is the militia or somehow the army or whatever. All you
[03:14:48.800 --> 03:14:51.680]  have to do is read the Constitution and see that the provisions dealing with the
[03:14:51.680 --> 03:14:55.840]  army and the navy are separate from the provisions dealing with the militia.
[03:14:55.840 --> 03:15:01.760]  They're two different entities. They know exactly what they're doing. Now let's
[03:15:01.760 --> 03:15:06.920]  shift gears sir and and and and and to pick your powerful brain on these issues
[03:15:06.920 --> 03:15:10.960]  one of the leading constitutional scholars out there Dr. Evan Vieira joins
[03:15:10.960 --> 03:15:16.360]  us right now if you just tuned in. Just I want to get your take on the overall
[03:15:16.360 --> 03:15:20.080]  atmosphere if you're shocked by it because I was expecting this but still
[03:15:20.080 --> 03:15:24.240]  just it's one thing to know it's coming but to see it happen the violent
[03:15:24.240 --> 03:15:28.080]  belligerence act that clearly states you know in the text we've shown here
[03:15:28.080 --> 03:15:32.360]  probably a hundred times the last two months it's very close to passing where
[03:15:32.360 --> 03:15:36.840]  it says if the army or the Justice Department wants you you disappear for
[03:15:36.840 --> 03:15:41.160]  even any intelligence purpose and only an act of Congress can even discover
[03:15:41.160 --> 03:15:46.800]  where you are you've got Cass Sunstein saying we can shut down free speech tax
[03:15:46.800 --> 03:15:50.560]  free speech make people carry what information we want their newspapers or
[03:15:50.560 --> 03:15:55.760]  websites you've got Elena Kagan and I've got the quotes it was basically saying
[03:15:55.760 --> 03:15:59.960]  we can ban any speech we want we can go after the Second Amendment I mean these
[03:15:59.960 --> 03:16:03.600]  people they're running around saying we'll put you on a secret list with no
[03:16:03.600 --> 03:16:09.640]  fly no buy you can't own guns they've got Republicans supporting that the end of
[03:16:09.640 --> 03:16:14.400]  habeas corpus I mean it's just it's just the Supreme Court just ruled you know
[03:16:14.400 --> 03:16:19.640]  no rights for detainees indefinite detention I mean it it's it's just for
[03:16:19.640 --> 03:16:23.400]  me as a layman but somebody who studied the Billarites Constitution in history
[03:16:23.400 --> 03:16:30.760]  is this not the most Orwellian system we could imagine I think Stalinist is
[03:16:30.760 --> 03:16:34.360]  actually the word for it because I suppose it's Orwellian in the sense that
[03:16:34.360 --> 03:16:37.840]  Orwell wrote fiction and we're looking at something which is so extraordinarily
[03:16:37.840 --> 03:16:42.080]  difficult to believe that it could even happen at all it will it is happening so
[03:16:42.080 --> 03:16:49.400]  quickly if you look at the the rise of the the police state mechanism 9-11 the
[03:16:49.400 --> 03:16:52.440]  Patriot Act the Military Commissions Act and now there's various things that you're
[03:16:52.440 --> 03:16:59.000]  talking about well how long has this been right a decade how quickly has this
[03:16:59.000 --> 03:17:03.480]  country degenerated and the amazing thing to me is the the uniformity of
[03:17:03.480 --> 03:17:10.080]  opinion among Democrats Republicans in the in the court system in the media the
[03:17:10.080 --> 03:17:16.080]  orchestration of this is what I shouldn't say shocks me but it just surprises me
[03:17:16.080 --> 03:17:20.680]  how how well the wheels have been greased to move this forward at a very
[03:17:20.680 --> 03:17:24.480]  rapid speed much faster than I certainly would have predicted but I think it's
[03:17:24.480 --> 03:17:29.440]  primarily because the economic system is deteriorating much faster than most of
[03:17:29.440 --> 03:17:33.200]  us would have predicted well said I mean when I really lay in bed and I'm
[03:17:33.200 --> 03:17:38.800]  thinking about this I asked myself how do I hear a UT law professor saying the
[03:17:38.800 --> 03:17:43.040]  health care bills constitutional on local radio and out of his mouth next he
[03:17:43.040 --> 03:17:47.600]  says stripping us of habeas corpus is good and the guy was supposedly a
[03:17:47.600 --> 03:17:51.680]  liberal I mean this guy isn't a liberal he's not a conservative he's a tyrant
[03:17:51.680 --> 03:17:56.720]  he's a danger to us all and it's the consistency among these people on both
[03:17:56.720 --> 03:18:00.920]  sides of the so-called political spectrum once again proving that the
[03:18:00.920 --> 03:18:05.920]  political spectrum that they present to us is essentially fictional it's there
[03:18:05.920 --> 03:18:10.800]  for another purpose it doesn't really represent a dichotomy in the views of the
[03:18:10.800 --> 03:18:15.000]  people on that side of the outline if you will they all have essentially the
[03:18:15.000 --> 03:18:19.080]  same view which to use I think the correct word is basically totalitarian
[03:18:19.080 --> 03:18:24.800]  they're going to tell us what to do and to help with us basically they don't
[03:18:24.800 --> 03:18:30.040]  intend to listen to us we are supposed to listen to them and everything that's
[03:18:30.040 --> 03:18:33.840]  coming out that's amazing that Cass Sunstein is a good example is coming out
[03:18:33.840 --> 03:18:37.480]  of Harvard Law School because I attended Harvard it was pretty liberal place even
[03:18:37.480 --> 03:18:41.640]  in my day and it's become quite a bit more liberal since then that was back in
[03:18:41.640 --> 03:18:48.000]  the 1970s and here's a professor at Harvard Law School who was blatantly
[03:18:48.000 --> 03:18:54.000]  promoting the suppression of political speech it was incredible and broad he
[03:18:54.000 --> 03:18:58.800]  didn't just pick out the Nazis to set the president he said arrest someone if
[03:18:58.800 --> 03:19:02.160]  they say anthropogenic global warming is a fraud that's right
[03:19:02.160 --> 03:19:06.960]  so how far does this go well it goes to the Stalinist point that if you say
[03:19:06.960 --> 03:19:11.240]  essentially anything that's against the regime the NKVD will show up at 3 o'clock
[03:19:11.240 --> 03:19:16.360]  in the morning and you'll disappear into the gulag and now I turn CNN on and
[03:19:16.360 --> 03:19:20.080]  they've got Lieberman and McCain going we want to be able to secretly arrest you
[03:19:20.080 --> 03:19:27.520]  and strip you of your citizenship yes let's take that next step right strip
[03:19:27.520 --> 03:19:31.160]  you of your citizenship so that now theoretically all sorts of rights
[03:19:31.160 --> 03:19:36.440]  disappear but to be of the consequence of that of course that if people want to
[03:19:36.440 --> 03:19:39.600]  be stripped of citizenship and I think that's unconstitutional as a principle
[03:19:39.600 --> 03:19:43.000]  but if you were to accept that principle it would strike me that the first
[03:19:43.000 --> 03:19:47.040]  people on that list would be these public officials who have violated their
[03:19:47.040 --> 03:19:51.240]  oath to the Constitution of the United States well they do I mean they do work

[03:24:03.360 --> 03:24:07.640]  next segment we're going to Bud if you want to hit his military stories out of
[03:24:07.640 --> 03:24:12.200]  Katrina powder Evan Vieira's with us for the rest of the hour Elena Kagan I
[03:24:12.200 --> 03:24:15.240]  mean what is this psychological tactic where they just throw everything in our
[03:24:15.240 --> 03:24:19.600]  face are they trying to break our will doctor because here she is never even
[03:24:19.600 --> 03:24:24.680]  been a judge they admit she was never litigated but she's had very little
[03:24:24.680 --> 03:24:29.720]  experience in the court system but then the the papers we do have from the
[03:24:29.720 --> 03:24:33.680]  University of Chicago law review and others I mean this is Stalinistic she
[03:24:33.680 --> 03:24:38.720]  she's a chip off the old Cass Sunstein block give us your breakdown Elena Kagan
[03:24:38.720 --> 03:24:42.600]  well I think that's exactly it that certain certain mentality there that's
[03:24:42.600 --> 03:24:46.840]  expressed in what she's written the interesting little thing yet to came to
[03:24:46.840 --> 03:24:52.640]  me she was a law clerk at the Supreme Court for Justice Blackman and the case
[03:24:52.640 --> 03:24:57.280]  came up involving the a subsequent amendment question and she wrote a
[03:24:57.280 --> 03:25:00.480]  little memo to him saying that the case shouldn't certainly shouldn't be
[03:25:00.480 --> 03:25:04.680]  granted the case bring question here it because she was not sympathetic to the
[03:25:04.680 --> 03:25:08.560]  issue I don't know that's an amazing attitude whether or not an individual
[03:25:08.560 --> 03:25:13.440]  war clerk or justice is sympathetic personally sympathetic to a constitutional
[03:25:13.440 --> 03:25:16.640]  question decides whether these questions are going to be heard well that would
[03:25:16.640 --> 03:25:20.840]  strike me as really a disqualification in terms of their psychological
[03:25:20.840 --> 03:25:25.120]  propensity if you will for dealing with this type of problem but then you look
[03:25:25.120 --> 03:25:28.080]  at the background you look at what she's advocated at least what she said
[03:25:28.080 --> 03:25:34.840]  print is having advocated and I would say that the very very bad decision to put
[03:25:34.840 --> 03:25:38.400]  her on the court but it's you know it's a piece of what's coming out of the
[03:25:38.400 --> 03:25:45.240]  Obama administration well let me do is of this type well again just watching
[03:25:45.240 --> 03:25:49.280]  Supreme Court nominations over the decades that's the number one thing
[03:25:49.280 --> 03:25:52.560]  that they're impartial and that they're gonna follow the Constitution but here
[03:25:52.560 --> 03:25:59.520]  she is admitting oh I I decide cases on what what I believe in and we know she's
[03:25:59.520 --> 03:26:03.720]  a gun grabber and so that memo right there she should be disqualified I think
[03:26:03.720 --> 03:26:08.800]  that's the attitude of the now justice Sotomayor as well I mean she would express
[03:26:08.800 --> 03:26:11.840]  the opinion that will judges make law well what does that mean when you're in
[03:26:11.840 --> 03:26:16.320]  a constitutional context I take it that means that she thinks that she can make
[03:26:16.320 --> 03:26:20.560]  or unmake different provisions of the Constitution which is clearly contrary
[03:26:20.560 --> 03:26:24.360]  to the whole theory of constitutional jurisprudence well why even have a
[03:26:24.360 --> 03:26:28.360]  Congress if I even have a president if the Supreme Court can do everything for
[03:26:28.360 --> 03:26:32.160]  us well that's right they become the these super legislature in fact superior
[03:26:32.160 --> 03:26:35.680]  to Congress because they can write constitutional decisions according to
[03:26:35.680 --> 03:26:40.440]  them control what Congress can do to put themselves in a fantastic position
[03:26:40.440 --> 03:26:44.240]  that's superior to the people because of the people to change the Constitution we
[03:26:44.240 --> 03:26:49.200]  have to go through the rather involved process under article 5 of getting all
[03:26:49.200 --> 03:26:52.440]  of those three quarters of the states through their legislatures or
[03:26:52.440 --> 03:26:55.680]  conventions to agree to some constitutional change whereas in the
[03:26:55.680 --> 03:27:00.480]  Supreme Court five votes out of nine does it plus if they say the Constitution
[03:27:00.480 --> 03:27:04.120]  is whatever they say it is it doesn't matter if we pass an amendment they would
[03:27:04.120 --> 03:27:08.080]  just basically exercise a veto yeah that's exactly right then they tell us
[03:27:08.080 --> 03:27:11.280]  what our amendment means and it may be something quite different but we thought
[03:27:11.280 --> 03:27:14.520]  from what we thought it meant but but let's go back to this psychological
[03:27:14.520 --> 03:27:20.360]  question the hubris or or or the arrogance why would they bring somebody
[03:27:20.360 --> 03:27:24.520]  forward who is the worst candidate that I've ever seen in history for the
[03:27:24.520 --> 03:27:27.520]  Supreme Court I mean she has no qualifications well number one she's
[03:27:27.520 --> 03:27:30.640]  going to be there for a very long time they want their kind of person there so
[03:27:30.640 --> 03:27:35.480]  she fits and she fits from the point of view of ideology and maybe also it's to
[03:27:35.480 --> 03:27:39.560]  show us that they can get away with anything they want to in very brazen
[03:27:39.560 --> 03:27:44.880]  fashion because she is relatively outspoken in terms of these ideological
[03:27:44.880 --> 03:27:49.520]  proclivities we have all that up but I think the real reason was she's someone
[03:27:49.520 --> 03:27:52.560]  who's going to be there quite a long time and she fits the ideological mold
[03:27:52.560 --> 03:27:56.960]  perfectly and she's apparently perfectly willing to exercise that ideology no
[03:27:56.960 --> 03:28:03.680]  matter what the Constitution may say but doesn't this just further discredit the
[03:28:03.680 --> 03:28:10.760]  court yes I guess it does but you tell me whether the court hasn't already been
[03:28:10.760 --> 03:28:16.160]  discredited beyond salvation at this point in time I mean I spent years
[03:28:16.160 --> 03:28:21.080]  litigating case in the Supreme Court before something my or or Kagan came on
[03:28:21.080 --> 03:28:26.940]  the court and I learned a long time ago that we were not going to restore the
[03:28:26.940 --> 03:28:30.240]  constitutional foundations of this republic through the Supreme Court
[03:28:30.240 --> 03:28:33.520]  the United States so what do we do have the constitutional crisis that's
[03:28:33.520 --> 03:28:37.400]  happened before as you know where the Congress because it controls the money
[03:28:37.400 --> 03:28:41.080]  starts really exercising power and what cuts the money off to them I mean what
[03:28:41.080 --> 03:28:44.400]  do you do well I think we have to go through the states number one because
[03:28:44.400 --> 03:28:48.480]  that's the legislative solution here and now a judicial solution that as the
[03:28:48.480 --> 03:28:52.160]  practical matters is too difficult to bring large numbers of these issues
[03:28:52.160 --> 03:28:55.040]  through the judicial system just takes too long and the court's stride will
[03:28:55.040 --> 03:28:58.160]  limit the the extent of the questions that are presented and they give you
[03:28:58.160 --> 03:29:02.640]  opinions that are insufficient whatever I have to be a legislative solution and
[03:29:02.640 --> 03:29:06.200]  it has to come through the states because Congress right now is a wasteland I
[03:29:06.200 --> 03:29:08.960]  think you will end up with a constitutional crisis you're going to
[03:29:08.960 --> 03:29:13.440]  come up to a situation where some significant number of states are taking
[03:29:13.440 --> 03:29:16.560]  one route and and Congress perhaps backed by some of the other states are
[03:29:16.560 --> 03:29:20.120]  taking another route and the people are going to have to weigh in on one side of
[03:29:20.120 --> 03:29:22.600]  the other and we can just keep our fingers crossed it'll be on the right
[03:29:22.600 --> 03:29:27.320]  side I agree this was a short segment long segment coming up he writes for
[03:29:27.320 --> 03:29:30.280]  news with views dot com that a lot of great books will tell you about some of
[03:29:30.280 --> 03:29:33.340]  those how you can get them and educate yourself before he leaves us and he's
[03:29:33.340 --> 03:29:37.840]  also I think one of the most powerful presenters in don't tread on me rise the
[03:29:37.840 --> 03:29:42.080]  republic available on DVD at info wars dot com and you will see it first on the

[03:33:13.720 --> 03:33:18.440]  his historical research dr. Evan Vieira's view on if he thinks we have a
[03:33:18.440 --> 03:33:22.080]  fighting chance or not why the globalists are moving so fast but right now
[03:33:22.080 --> 03:33:26.960]  let's get to a few your calls that have been patiently holding but in Georgia
[03:33:26.960 --> 03:33:34.920]  you're on the air go ahead sir Alex you there yes I am hey I am a retired person
[03:33:34.920 --> 03:33:39.840]  from a very large delivery company that drives brown trucks and I was assigned
[03:33:39.840 --> 03:33:46.800]  to help clean up my company's property at the hurricane and in doing so I was
[03:33:46.800 --> 03:33:53.200]  there two weeks and doing so I don't think people really understand what
[03:33:53.200 --> 03:34:02.760]  martial law is there was the regular army not not reserves regular army
[03:34:02.760 --> 03:34:10.280]  patrolling the streets we had to we could not go to our area until after
[03:34:10.280 --> 03:34:18.080]  daylight we had to be off the area by 6 a.m. or 6 p.m. we were escorted to the
[03:34:18.080 --> 03:34:24.680]  area where we were cleaning up and during that time they were constantly
[03:34:24.680 --> 03:34:31.960]  walking the streets monitoring everything and we were told when we left
[03:34:31.960 --> 03:34:38.240]  our building which was about 60 miles away that the only thing we could have
[03:34:38.240 --> 03:34:43.480]  in our pocket state they gave us a lunch to take with us the only thing we
[03:34:43.480 --> 03:34:48.680]  could have in our pockets were our driver's license and our DOT card which
[03:34:48.680 --> 03:34:58.280]  was required by the government patrolling the area we were in there to
[03:34:58.280 --> 03:35:05.280]  salvage our vehicles and things like that but while we were in there you know
[03:35:05.280 --> 03:35:10.480]  you start seeing these regular troops on a regular basis walking their their
[03:35:10.480 --> 03:35:17.280]  routes and I was approached by one a matter of fact I got my picture made
[03:35:17.280 --> 03:35:22.280]  with four of them in full combat everything what I had my picture made
[03:35:22.280 --> 03:35:30.000]  I still have that I was approached by one came up to me and said if I see
[03:35:30.000 --> 03:35:36.000]  anybody that looks like he's going to be looting or looks like he might have a
[03:35:36.000 --> 03:35:41.080]  weapon to come and get him that he wanted me to come get him personally that
[03:35:41.080 --> 03:35:46.680]  he wanted to take him out that they had orders to take anybody out that was
[03:35:46.680 --> 03:35:52.520]  looting or had a weapon and they went confiscated citizens guns who were high
[03:35:52.520 --> 03:35:57.240]  and dry with that military call in that talked about witnessing the police would
[03:35:57.240 --> 03:36:02.560]  change ripping the doors off jewelry stores and and dragging safes out did
[03:36:02.560 --> 03:36:05.800]  you see and it was also on the news the police looting Walmart did you see any
[03:36:05.800 --> 03:36:09.920]  of that no I'm sorry I didn't see that I'm glad you didn't say it well God
[03:36:09.920 --> 03:36:12.840]  bless you sir I appreciate that call for those who just joined us those are some
[03:36:12.840 --> 03:36:16.880]  leftover callers from previous hour when we were taking calls from people that
[03:36:16.880 --> 03:36:21.960]  witnessed what martial law is like going back to Dr. Evan Vieira shifting gears
[03:36:21.960 --> 03:36:27.120]  I wanted to ask you this question you know during the break I was saying
[03:36:27.120 --> 03:36:30.800]  why are they so bold why are they moving so fast and you said they're
[03:36:30.800 --> 03:36:34.440]  running out of time recap that in your own words because you've got some faith
[03:36:34.440 --> 03:36:39.720]  you think you think people are waking up well this economic machine that they're
[03:36:39.720 --> 03:36:43.640]  running out of the Federal Reserve is like a car with square wheels out you
[03:36:43.640 --> 03:36:48.680]  drive a car with square wheels long enough and there'd be a lot of damage to
[03:36:48.680 --> 03:36:51.680]  the front end the damage to the differential damage to the transmission
[03:36:51.680 --> 03:36:55.760]  and at some stage that car is going to fall apart you know that you just don't
[03:36:55.760 --> 03:37:00.200]  know exactly when but as it's shaking itself to pieces at a certain stage to
[03:37:00.200 --> 03:37:02.600]  say well it's not going to be very much longer I think that's what they're
[03:37:02.600 --> 03:37:06.640]  looking at they recognize they can't really be sure they can keep this system
[03:37:06.640 --> 03:37:10.880]  under control so they have to get as much control of us into place as
[03:37:10.880 --> 03:37:15.520]  possible in the shortest length of time because they don't know exactly when the
[03:37:15.520 --> 03:37:19.880]  crisis is going to hit now the difficulty for them however is that
[03:37:19.880 --> 03:37:24.960]  their technique has always been the boiling of the frog story right if you
[03:37:24.960 --> 03:37:30.120]  drop the frog into the hot pan of boiling water the frog leaps out literally
[03:37:30.120 --> 03:37:33.240]  before it even gets into the water whereas if you put the frog into cool
[03:37:33.240 --> 03:37:39.080]  water and then and the frog will not notice what's happening and eventually
[03:37:39.080 --> 03:37:44.040]  be boiled they're heating up the pan now at an increasingly rapid rate and I
[03:37:44.040 --> 03:37:49.120]  think the numbers are waking up to the fact that they're being boiled and it's
[03:37:49.120 --> 03:37:52.560]  only a matter of a very short length of time when enough of them start to jump
[03:37:52.560 --> 03:37:56.240]  out of that pan I think we're seeing that the Tea Party movement was seeing
[03:37:56.240 --> 03:37:59.080]  that of course in what you're doing and educating people all over the country
[03:37:59.080 --> 03:38:04.000]  it's becoming more and more apparent that the the blinders are being stripped
[03:38:04.000 --> 03:38:08.160]  off the eyes of the average American and he can see who's who and what's what
[03:38:08.160 --> 03:38:12.200]  and now it's simply a matter of getting him to understand what needs to be done
[03:38:12.200 --> 03:38:16.880]  to deal with these problems that he recognizes are there finally recognizes
[03:38:16.880 --> 03:38:22.680]  are there break it down where we're going what individuals can do what
[03:38:22.680 --> 03:38:27.920]  communities can do you know let's say you're the general trying to direct
[03:38:27.920 --> 03:38:31.640]  people on the best course of action to take the republic back from these people
[03:38:31.640 --> 03:38:37.200]  via the states and as well as the federal government what is the proper
[03:38:37.200 --> 03:38:40.880]  role the states and the people under the 9th and 10th amendment of course you
[03:38:40.880 --> 03:38:47.240]  covered and don't tread on me how do we legally and lawfully block and then
[03:38:47.240 --> 03:38:52.560]  checkmate this criminal takeover well I think number one we have to get control
[03:38:52.560 --> 03:38:57.800]  of our local economies because with the economy goes down in general the
[03:38:57.800 --> 03:39:00.800]  average man is going to be in a desperate situation he's going to be
[03:39:00.800 --> 03:39:04.920]  willing to take direction from higher up authorities from central government
[03:39:04.920 --> 03:39:09.760]  from martial law figures or what the man on the white horse type syndrome and
[03:39:09.760 --> 03:39:15.080]  the economy is the thing that really is the linchpin here and we have the
[03:39:15.080 --> 03:39:18.800]  opportunity to do that but it's going to require action at the state level and
[03:39:18.800 --> 03:39:22.600]  action at the state level directed towards what towards providing the
[03:39:22.600 --> 03:39:26.920]  foundation for any sound economy which is a sound currency system we don't have
[03:39:26.920 --> 03:39:31.000]  that now our problem is centrally located in the federal reserve system we
[03:39:31.000 --> 03:39:33.920]  wouldn't have all of these difficulties today at least not to the degree that we
[03:39:33.920 --> 03:39:38.200]  have them if that system warranted operation hadn't been an operation since
[03:39:38.200 --> 03:39:42.800]  before World War one so we need to take action at the state level to bring in
[03:39:42.800 --> 03:39:46.600]  an alternative currency and we see that already happening at least in the sense
[03:39:46.600 --> 03:39:50.960]  that various state legislators are putting in bills to that effect there's
[03:39:50.960 --> 03:39:54.600]  one this year in Georgia in South Carolina there was one last year in
[03:39:54.600 --> 03:39:59.560]  Indiana and Montana I think Colorado had one people in Oklahoma talking about
[03:39:59.560 --> 03:40:04.760]  it so I think it's a matter of the folks at the grassroots making the contacts
[03:40:04.760 --> 03:40:08.840]  with state legislators that they think have a true constitutionalist bent
[03:40:08.840 --> 03:40:12.680]  number one and some understanding of the economics of the situation saying
[03:40:12.680 --> 03:40:18.960]  look we need you to take a strong look at this kind of legislation we can in
[03:40:18.960 --> 03:40:22.680]  fact we have the constitutional authority actually the Supreme Court already ruled on
[03:40:22.680 --> 03:40:27.160]  this particular question ruled on this particular question in the late 1800s
[03:40:27.160 --> 03:40:31.200]  whether a state could institute and use an alternative currency and not be
[03:40:31.200 --> 03:40:35.800]  required to use the currency that Congress had emitted at that time was the
[03:40:35.800 --> 03:40:40.720]  Lincoln greenbacks the original Lincoln greenbacks so we even have the Supreme
[03:40:40.720 --> 03:40:45.440]  Court on our side on this one besides the 10th amendment that night that that's
[03:40:45.440 --> 03:40:50.320]  number one because if you have the alternative currency in place then that
[03:40:50.320 --> 03:40:55.720]  state is not going to suffer the full ravages of economic dislocations when
[03:40:55.720 --> 03:41:00.560]  this banking system comes down as I am fairly confident it will and I think the
[03:41:00.560 --> 03:41:03.440]  key here is you're saying we've got to start getting this in place now and as
[03:41:03.440 --> 03:41:07.440]  Ron Paul and others have said we have to identify the private central banks as the
[03:41:07.440 --> 03:41:12.680]  problem so they can't use the crisis they've created to slingshot them into
[03:41:12.680 --> 03:41:16.480]  an even greater position of power that's exactly right we have to be in the
[03:41:16.480 --> 03:41:20.720]  position of saying at in in our states we have an alternative currency system in
[03:41:20.720 --> 03:41:25.560]  place now we don't need you or your solution to the problem that you caused
[03:41:25.560 --> 03:41:30.520]  right you can take your paper money and you can eat it if you want we no longer
[03:41:30.520 --> 03:41:33.200]  need that we don't need something from the IMF we don't need something from the
[03:41:33.200 --> 03:41:35.960]  Bank of International Settlements however they intend to set this up on a
[03:41:35.960 --> 03:41:40.440]  global scale because we have adopted a spectrometry sound in constitutional
[03:41:40.440 --> 03:41:44.760]  currency that's step number one but step number two then has to be the
[03:41:44.760 --> 03:41:49.720]  organization within each state of the total community in the way the
[03:41:49.720 --> 03:41:54.080]  Constitution tells us is necessary to the security of a pre-state that is the
[03:41:54.080 --> 03:41:59.200]  well-regulated militia so that we can control our homeland security problems
[03:41:59.200 --> 03:42:05.440]  at the local and state level and not be dependent upon FEMA or the Army or for
[03:42:05.440 --> 03:42:08.560]  that matter even the National Guard and that's why they've raced to make us so
[03:42:08.560 --> 03:42:12.600]  domesticated where people see someone knifed and stabbed to death they're so
[03:42:12.600 --> 03:42:16.720]  lazy they don't even call the police much less help the person themselves
[03:42:16.720 --> 03:42:21.520]  that's what the Kitty Genovese syndrome right remember that story yes the poor
[03:42:21.520 --> 03:42:24.320]  woman that was screaming in New York City and people were looking out their
[03:42:24.320 --> 03:42:27.040]  windows but nobody did anything and she was I think that's right because it was
[03:42:27.040 --> 03:42:31.240]  a knife to death all right exactly that that attitude so we have to turn that
[03:42:31.240 --> 03:42:35.560]  around completely and bring people back into what the Constitution tells us is
[03:42:35.560 --> 03:42:40.040]  the necessary mode of total community organization now once you put those two
[03:42:40.040 --> 03:42:44.760]  things together the alternative currency and the revitalized constitutional
[03:42:44.760 --> 03:42:48.520]  militia structure again I'm talking about the militia under the US
[03:42:48.520 --> 03:42:52.320]  Constitution not some kind of private organizations means that once you have
[03:42:52.320 --> 03:42:59.880]  those two that state will be exercising the two key powers of government as all
[03:42:59.880 --> 03:43:04.920]  political philosophy tells us the power of the purse my power of the money and
[03:43:04.920 --> 03:43:09.960]  the power of the sword homeland security the militia would whatever term you want
[03:43:09.960 --> 03:43:15.360]  to use those are the keys because you will not have state sovereignty and you
[03:43:15.360 --> 03:43:20.000]  certainly will not have popular sovereignty until those two powers have
[03:43:20.000 --> 03:43:24.200]  been returned to the state and directly to the people if you have a proper
[03:43:24.200 --> 03:43:28.560]  alternative currency which is based upon gold and silver so it's tied directly
[03:43:28.560 --> 03:43:33.320]  into the marketplace then the people will have direct control over that and if
[03:43:33.320 --> 03:43:38.480]  you have the militia which is composed of the people as a whole armed and
[03:43:38.480 --> 03:43:42.680]  organized and disciplined and trained in some way then you will have that level
[03:43:42.680 --> 03:43:46.360]  of state sovereignty directly controlled by the people and when the people
[03:43:46.360 --> 03:43:51.080]  control those two levels of state sovereignty you have true self-government
[03:43:51.080 --> 03:43:55.600]  and we have the founding fathers expected us to be hope that we would be
[03:43:55.600 --> 03:43:58.960]  and gave us the tools to get there all right let me let me ask you that a
[03:43:58.960 --> 03:44:05.080]  constitutional law question and I want to be specific when I criticize ragtag
[03:44:05.080 --> 03:44:09.600]  militias I'm not criticizing the men the women the people that see the threat the
[03:44:09.600 --> 03:44:13.840]  people that are forming their own local communities you know unorganized I think
[03:44:13.840 --> 03:44:17.880]  that's good the problem is the feds have been caught going in trying to radicalize
[03:44:17.880 --> 03:44:22.600]  making them act like clowns provocaturing them to then demonize the
[03:44:22.600 --> 03:44:26.840]  overall idea of a militia the real militia and explain it in the actual
[03:44:26.840 --> 03:44:32.040]  constitutional terms would be if we took over our counties and cities and then
[03:44:32.040 --> 03:44:36.600]  we're the people and then we the voters decide how it's set up and we're not
[03:44:36.600 --> 03:44:40.520]  paying all these federal taxes we're levying the taxes locally we're making
[03:44:40.520 --> 03:44:44.360]  the decisions we actually are in control the police we're in control the
[03:44:44.360 --> 03:44:48.880]  juries the grand juries we run things but to do that we've got to be involved
[03:44:48.880 --> 03:44:52.920]  but but going out behind the you know the cabin with your neighbor and saying
[03:44:52.920 --> 03:44:56.160]  we're preparing to take on the new world order that's fine to defend yourself
[03:44:56.160 --> 03:45:00.600]  from criminals or whatever or even if you had to a tyrannical government but to
[03:45:00.600 --> 03:45:04.920]  offensively take the nation back it needs to be the county sheriffs the county
[03:45:04.920 --> 03:45:10.080]  commissioners the city council we need to have this message and take over the
[03:45:10.080 --> 03:45:14.220]  government and run our flag up that's the official way to do it that's what the
[03:45:14.220 --> 03:45:17.640]  founders did the 13 colonies the government representatives they went
[03:45:17.640 --> 03:45:21.680]  together they got together and it was legitimate it was real instead you have
[03:45:21.680 --> 03:45:25.440]  the Republic of Texas not all the groups but saying I'm the president you had
[03:45:25.440 --> 03:45:28.800]  ten you know eight different groups and they were all the president it was it
[03:45:28.800 --> 03:45:34.000]  was clownish that's exactly right that the key to this is to obtain legal
[03:45:34.000 --> 03:45:38.600]  authority under our constitutional structure there is a way to do that you
[03:45:38.600 --> 03:45:42.080]  can look back to history all the way into the earliest colonial times you can
[03:45:42.080 --> 03:45:47.280]  see what that structure was we can do it now it's a matter of ultimately it's a
[03:45:47.280 --> 03:45:51.240]  matter of passing a statute I think it could probably be done at a county
[03:45:51.240 --> 03:45:55.080]  level or the town level or whatever but it would have only obviously limited
[03:45:55.080 --> 03:45:58.360]  authority within that jurisdiction but those could be models for the state
[03:45:58.360 --> 03:46:01.440]  that's right you could obviously you could start doing this kind of thing I
[03:46:01.440 --> 03:46:03.600]  wouldn't if they were done at the county level I wouldn't call the
[03:46:03.600 --> 03:46:07.200]  organization's militia if your county council said something up you might call
[03:46:07.200 --> 03:46:11.640]  it a county committee of safety or a county homeland defense organizational
[03:46:11.640 --> 03:46:16.080]  whatever give it some other name because in in constitutional principle you know
[03:46:16.080 --> 03:46:19.640]  what the militia are called the militia of the several states they are state
[03:46:19.640 --> 03:46:24.400]  institutions and they always were they were broken down internally by towns or
[03:46:24.400 --> 03:46:28.240]  counties what matters is they're accountable to the people instead of the
[03:46:28.240 --> 03:46:32.080]  feds coming in and controlling the local system that's right because they are
[03:46:32.080 --> 03:46:36.560]  the people you see that you have perfect transparency you have perfect
[03:46:36.560 --> 03:46:40.840]  accountability why because these institutions are self-governing
[03:46:40.840 --> 03:46:45.920]  institutions composed of the people themselves that's what I did always
[03:46:45.920 --> 03:46:49.760]  amazing how difficult it seems to be to get this idea across to the average
[03:46:49.760 --> 03:46:54.520]  American if you want self-government then you have to start exercising or
[03:46:54.520 --> 03:46:58.520]  participating yourself in self-government self-government is not a spectator
[03:46:58.520 --> 03:47:02.920]  sport you can't abdicate and quote hire professionals because in every case in
[03:47:02.920 --> 03:47:06.920]  history the professionals are going to come in and rob you that's what they're
[03:47:06.920 --> 03:47:10.920]  going to become the governors and you're going to become the subject that's the
[03:47:10.920 --> 03:47:15.320]  rule of the rule of history the rule of political philosophy every time you look
[03:47:15.320 --> 03:47:19.520]  at that kind of a system it moves in the direction of centralized control and the
[03:47:19.520 --> 03:47:23.080]  people lower down in the pyramid to those pyramidal structures the people
[03:47:23.080 --> 03:47:27.440]  lower down in the pyramid have less and less control our constitutional pyramid
[03:47:27.440 --> 03:47:31.880]  works exactly the other way sovereignty is at the bottom and less and less
[03:47:31.880 --> 03:47:37.960]  authority is delegated to the top but for sovereignty to exist sovereignty has
[03:47:37.960 --> 03:47:42.560]  to be exercised people cannot claim to be sovereigns unless they take sovereign
[03:47:42.560 --> 03:47:47.200]  actions unless they perform sovereign functions otherwise they're going to be
[03:47:47.200 --> 03:47:52.120]  subjects that's right I mean if you want to bake a cake you got to make it that's
[03:47:52.120 --> 03:47:55.820]  right didn't you cut the beat you've got to be the cook you've got to mix the
[03:47:55.820 --> 03:48:00.560]  ingredients follow the recipe take those steps and then be responsible for the
[03:48:00.560 --> 03:48:05.080]  outcome right well people in this country don't want to do is they don't
[03:48:05.080 --> 03:48:08.320]  want number one apparently too many of them from too long haven't wanted to do
[03:48:08.320 --> 03:48:11.920]  the work and then they wanted to pass on the responsibility for failure to
[03:48:11.920 --> 03:48:17.280]  somebody else in a self-governing society you're responsible for success and
[03:48:17.280 --> 03:48:23.120]  failure let me ask you this question no other country except maybe Switzerland
[03:48:23.120 --> 03:48:28.120]  than other ones for a time has been able to do what we've created here and I
[03:48:28.120 --> 03:48:32.160]  really research our founders and they were some of the most exceptional men
[03:48:32.160 --> 03:48:37.720]  in history in such a large concentration of exceptional I mean that's why the
[03:48:37.720 --> 03:48:45.840]  king of England King George III whenever George Washington refused kingship here
[03:48:45.840 --> 03:48:49.800]  in the US he said he's the greatest man on the world today because no one in
[03:48:49.800 --> 03:48:56.520]  in my in really in history had refused the Caesar power when it was offered so
[03:48:56.520 --> 03:49:00.400]  that I just don't know we're so wrecked societally we're so decadent and lazy
[03:49:00.400 --> 03:49:04.480]  there's a lot of good people and in a republic it doesn't matter of 80% or a
[03:49:04.480 --> 03:49:08.000]  bunch of sloths I guess it's up to us to go take over the system and be the
[03:49:08.000 --> 03:49:11.520]  sovereigns but then you if the but if the masses involved it'll kind of
[03:49:11.520 --> 03:49:15.600]  degenerate back into the same thing I mean are we up to this beautiful
[03:49:15.600 --> 03:49:20.280]  republic do we even deserve it well we have to be because we have no choice
[03:49:20.280 --> 03:49:24.720]  the only choices to give up and let those people who are far worse than we
[03:49:24.720 --> 03:49:31.840]  are the New World Order rights win and damn it I don't intend to let them do
[03:49:31.840 --> 03:49:36.400]  that no no I agree with you I just we have no choice now I think we'll find
[03:49:36.400 --> 03:49:42.480]  enough people you know Lebanon is a very small amount of the low right yes the
[03:49:42.480 --> 03:49:49.520]  east is just a tiny amount and it moves the entire mass of flour we will find
[03:49:49.520 --> 03:49:54.320]  that five percent or ten percent and then the great mass of people most of
[03:49:54.320 --> 03:49:58.000]  whom I think in this country of people of goodwill and basic common sense you
[03:49:58.000 --> 03:50:01.000]  know they may not have been educated as well as they should have been in this
[03:50:01.000 --> 03:50:05.520]  public school system you can go down this list of horribles that we have but
[03:50:05.520 --> 03:50:10.440]  basically I think they're of sound mind and good disposition and when they are
[03:50:10.440 --> 03:50:17.440]  shown by a proper leadership group the right way to go they will go along oh I
[03:50:17.440 --> 03:50:21.880]  agree with you they've never been shown what true freedom is they've just been
[03:50:21.880 --> 03:50:25.480]  kind of in this ether a fish doesn't know it's in the water that's right and
[03:50:25.480 --> 03:50:29.600]  they have this the good sense to know which way to jump I mean the fish knows
[03:50:29.600 --> 03:50:33.720]  as the good sense to know which way to jump not back onto the sand but into
[03:50:33.720 --> 03:50:37.360]  the water right if you've given the opportunity I've given the opportunity
[03:50:37.360 --> 03:50:42.280]  I think exactly the same as true of the average American when the right leaders
[03:50:42.280 --> 03:50:46.200]  come along and show them the correct alternatives they will adopt those
[03:50:46.200 --> 03:50:49.880]  alternatives well I study history I mean just a hundred years ago people
[03:50:49.880 --> 03:50:53.960]  jealously guarded their freedom and knew it was important we've got to get that
[03:50:53.960 --> 03:50:57.520]  same mistrust of government fact we've got a we've got to cut the size of it
[03:50:57.520 --> 03:51:00.160]  stay there doctor

[03:52:12.360 --> 03:52:16.720]  minority rights not democracy not mob rule two wolves and a sheep voting on

[03:54:11.720 --> 03:54:15.960]  Republic that has a lot of these great constitutional ideas ingrained in it
[03:54:15.960 --> 03:54:20.480]  very important to relearn the Bill of Rights and Constitution and to get this
[03:54:20.480 --> 03:54:24.920]  information out to everyone you know available at info wars dot com it's up
[03:54:24.920 --> 03:54:28.120]  to you first we've got to educate the people we've got to take action we've
[03:54:28.120 --> 03:54:32.320]  got to get it done but the road to hell is paid with good intentions but it's
[03:54:32.320 --> 03:54:35.960]  far past that I talked about this 14 years ago now it's mainstream news that
[03:54:35.960 --> 03:54:41.640]  all babies at birth for 30 plus years 37 38 years in all the Western nations have
[03:54:41.640 --> 03:54:45.600]  had their blood taken for a global DNA database now there's debate in Congress
[03:54:45.600 --> 03:54:53.240]  right now this is a KTSM news channel this Katie law where everybody who
[03:54:53.240 --> 03:54:58.160]  basically gets arrested will have DNA taken and and a judge just ruled in
[03:54:58.160 --> 03:55:01.760]  Texas they're taking bloody legally without warrants for DWIs they're
[03:55:01.760 --> 03:55:04.320]  having the police do it and the police say they don't care they're gonna
[03:55:04.320 --> 03:55:09.080]  continue it a judge in Texas said that these toll road cameras and speed
[03:55:09.080 --> 03:55:13.160]  cameras aren't constitutional because I'm an officer involved the police don't
[03:55:13.160 --> 03:55:17.680]  stop I mean there's just a real lawlessness we're seeing from government
[03:55:17.680 --> 03:55:23.320]  and you know that particular aspect of lawlessness because it's a growing level
[03:55:23.320 --> 03:55:28.000]  of police state really brutality that's involved not simply they're fated to
[03:55:28.000 --> 03:55:33.080]  abide by court decisions or statutes or whatever but actually a brutalizing the
[03:55:33.080 --> 03:55:40.160]  the people if you revitalize the militia in a particular state all of those
[03:55:40.160 --> 03:55:45.520]  police departments sheriff's departments state police what have you would
[03:55:45.520 --> 03:55:51.080]  become subsets of the militia structure and then they would be subject to
[03:55:51.080 --> 03:55:56.200]  discipline by the citizens in their own local communities and I can guarantee you
[03:55:56.200 --> 03:56:02.240]  that within about a week after that it happened all of that behavior would stop
[03:56:02.240 --> 03:56:08.200]  because the consequences to any particular police officer would be so
[03:56:08.200 --> 03:56:15.960]  horrendous that they wouldn't do it and the media always frames this like that
[03:56:15.960 --> 03:56:20.640]  would persecute police no then the good cops would be put into positions of
[03:56:20.640 --> 03:56:24.360]  power instead of the bad ones being elevated now they're kicking the good
[03:56:24.360 --> 03:56:27.760]  cops out the bad ones would be weeded out very quickly they'd be weeded out
[03:56:27.760 --> 03:56:31.360]  either because they'd be caught in discipline and expelled or because they
[03:56:31.360 --> 03:56:34.680]  take a look at the situation and wouldn't want to take the risk and they try to
[03:56:34.680 --> 03:56:39.400]  find another job you know to go to Starbucks and serve coffee or what have
[03:56:39.400 --> 03:56:44.760]  you and there's the difficulty you know many years ago I remember in New York
[03:56:44.760 --> 03:56:49.320]  City when Lindsay was the mayor of New York City there were complaints from the
[03:56:49.320 --> 03:56:54.840]  black community about the way the city police were dealing with those people
[03:56:54.840 --> 03:56:58.960]  and very discriminatory and high-handed they didn't use the term police state
[03:56:58.960 --> 03:57:02.120]  but that's what they were talking about police state fashion and they wanted to
[03:57:02.120 --> 03:57:07.840]  set up I think they did end up setting up a citizens review board well
[03:57:07.840 --> 03:57:12.920]  that's essentially how a militia would operate as a huge citizens review board
[03:57:12.920 --> 03:57:16.960]  because all of these uniformed militia members who were in the subsets of the
[03:57:16.960 --> 03:57:20.800]  militia called the local police or the state police or what have you would now
[03:57:20.800 --> 03:57:26.040]  have to answer on a regular basis to the members of their own local militia
[03:57:26.040 --> 03:57:30.720]  companies and be subject to some kind of militia discipline if they had misbehaved
