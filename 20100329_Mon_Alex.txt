[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.760 --> 00:29.840]  well there's no doubt about it this is the start of the big attack you go back
[00:29.840 --> 00:38.280]  to World War one and the Germans would launch an attack and then the Allied
[00:38.280 --> 00:42.640]  forces Russia England France the United States they would launch another attack
[00:42.640 --> 00:48.680]  and it would start with an artillery barrage and it could continue hours or
[00:48.680 --> 00:54.440]  even days and sometimes they would have false start attacks just to probe the
[00:54.440 --> 01:00.440]  enemy defenses along the lines there is no doubt that a massive attack has been
[01:00.440 --> 01:05.720]  going on the last four months to demonize conservatives tea partiers
[01:05.720 --> 01:11.960]  libertarians gun owners conservatives people that are nationalist I've seen
[01:11.960 --> 01:17.960]  the preparatory phase as the mainstream media conditions and brainwashes and
[01:17.960 --> 01:27.800]  prepares the public or staged terror attack events to be blamed on the
[01:27.800 --> 01:32.960]  American people so that the giant homeland security system can be publicly
[01:32.960 --> 01:36.720]  turned loose it was built from the beginning for the American people part
[01:36.720 --> 01:41.560]  of the COG Rex 84 program of the 80s and that's now all admitted and they've
[01:41.560 --> 01:46.120]  got the open legislation in Congress to arrest citizens for any reason including
[01:46.120 --> 01:50.560]  intelligence reasons or any reasons the president names you can openly be
[01:50.560 --> 01:56.120]  tortured now there's similar language in other acts like the enemy combatant
[01:56.120 --> 02:03.000]  act but this is out on the open and crystal clear they won a hot war against
[02:03.000 --> 02:08.400]  the American people and you're going to see governments in concert doing this
[02:08.400 --> 02:14.080]  type of stuff the Russian bombing in Moscow or two bombings very very
[02:14.080 --> 02:18.640]  suspicious we reserve judgment on that just like with the underwear bomber
[02:18.640 --> 02:23.080]  first few days we said could be real then of course it came out it was staged
[02:23.080 --> 02:29.080]  more than nine times out of ten these events are staged in hindsight so it's
[02:29.080 --> 02:33.560]  probably staged as well and there's a lot of earmarks that it is FSB or other
[02:33.560 --> 02:38.160]  groups part of the Russian security services who are famous for this like
[02:38.160 --> 02:44.440]  all powerful empires Putin and Mededev are having a lot of political trouble
[02:44.440 --> 02:47.280]  over there there's a lot of opposition starting to mount this is a great way to
[02:47.280 --> 02:51.880]  clamp down and gets the approval ratings up and the usual suspect Muslim
[02:51.880 --> 02:55.640]  leaders out of Chechnya of course are denying that they're involved why would
[02:55.640 --> 03:00.840]  you go bomb civilians which you know then gets public support behind invading
[03:00.840 --> 03:06.720]  you and we know that the triggers to go after Chechnya in the late 1990s were
[03:06.720 --> 03:11.520]  staged and Paul Watson has an article separately you have militia raids in
[03:11.520 --> 03:18.240]  three states we now have one of the indictments a supposed Christian group
[03:18.240 --> 03:23.340]  who the feds are saying wanted to wage war against the police and kill police to
[03:23.340 --> 03:27.520]  demoralize them you notice we have people calling in trying to bait us last
[03:27.520 --> 03:33.040]  week here on air calling for physical operations and I said of course that's
[03:33.040 --> 03:37.480]  not what we need we're winning this thing peacefully you don't offensively go
[03:37.480 --> 03:43.160]  out and it's always cops the feds target or citizens they target their own
[03:43.160 --> 03:48.240]  police and provocateur attacks on their own police or attacks that fizzle to
[03:48.240 --> 03:53.440]  scare police and they bomb the Oklahoma City building the feds did to rally the
[03:53.440 --> 03:55.880]  feds against the American people to create a nuts against them tap my
[03:55.880 --> 04:02.040]  mentality that's totally proven you've got just fever pitch attacks on myself and
[04:02.040 --> 04:06.000]  many others right now the mainstream media continues to say that I'm calling
[04:06.000 --> 04:15.160]  for violence and that police being killed is my fault and we've gone over that
[04:15.160 --> 04:22.400]  in the past so it's creepy it's creepy to have singing in call me up at about
[04:22.400 --> 04:26.440]  2 30 on Friday and say yeah we want to interview you tonight and then it was oh
[04:26.440 --> 04:30.280]  we want to interview you in a taped interview in about an hour so I ran
[04:30.280 --> 04:36.920]  down there after the show and we'll we'll talk about what happened at the
[04:36.920 --> 04:42.120]  Austin studio booked into CNN for the Anderson Cooper program which did not
[04:42.120 --> 04:45.760]  air so I didn't give them anything they could really use unless they really
[04:45.760 --> 04:51.240]  edit what I had to say out of context but I'm telling right now they're
[04:51.240 --> 04:57.080]  planning massive stage terror attacks in the next month we'll be right back

[07:57.120 --> 07:59.120]  Make sure hands go.
[07:59.120 --> 08:00.620]  Wow!
[08:00.620 --> 08:20.920]  We are live ladies and gentlemen. It is Monday the 29th day of March, 2010.
[08:20.920 --> 08:34.740]  These are the times that try men's souls. This is only at the beginning.
[08:50.920 --> 09:09.160]  But on this battlefield no one lends, not the FBI, not the CIA, not the American people.
[09:09.160 --> 09:15.360]  The banks, they're not on the battlefield, they're not on the chessboard, they're
[09:15.360 --> 09:22.040]  playing with our lives like they're God. With their genetically engineered food,
[09:22.040 --> 09:27.720]  with their Hadron Super Collider, playing God with their Chemtrails, with their
[09:27.720 --> 09:32.440]  weather modification, with all the horrible things they're doing. I wish I
[09:32.440 --> 09:39.080]  would have gotten in here earlier this morning. I got into the office about 30
[09:39.080 --> 09:42.720]  minutes before showtime. I was getting ready at my home for the show, reading
[09:42.720 --> 09:46.000]  over all the news, and trying to figure out exactly what's happened with these
[09:46.000 --> 09:54.560]  subway bombings in Moscow. And I got into the office and was just hit from all
[09:54.560 --> 10:01.720]  sides. Former Senator Nancy Schaefer shot to death with husband. This is out of
[10:01.720 --> 10:06.920]  Georgia. And we get about 5,000 emails a day, several hundred phone calls or more
[10:06.920 --> 10:11.400]  a day, and we don't have the money or the crew or the staff to be able to go
[10:11.400 --> 10:15.840]  through it all. We try our best. The last few months, she'd been calling, trying to
[10:15.840 --> 10:19.640]  talk to me, saying she had something really big that she was about to come out
[10:19.640 --> 10:24.160]  with. She talked to Rob Dube. And then the producers come up and say, do you want
[10:24.160 --> 10:27.800]  this person? You want that person? And I'm so overwhelmed with all these other
[10:27.800 --> 10:32.440]  distractions like Climate Gate and the takeover of health care, and the media
[10:32.440 --> 10:37.800]  setting up the Patriot Movement for a big fall. The big kickoffs already begun, but
[10:37.800 --> 10:43.160]  I look for something huge. In April, by exposing it, we made back them off. We've
[10:43.160 --> 10:50.840]  been hacked today. We've had them posting viruses on the site today. We're having to
[10:50.840 --> 10:55.720]  shut off links in the comment pages because they're trying to put viruses in
[10:55.720 --> 11:00.720]  there. And they're very mad about what I did in the CNN interview and the fact
[11:00.720 --> 11:09.440]  that I posted that on YouTube. Death threats, just insanity from all ends. I
[11:09.440 --> 11:17.720]  mean, definitely they are been given green lights to go wild right now. Former
[11:17.720 --> 11:23.160]  Senator Nancy Schaefer shot to death with husband. And we've been contacted
[11:23.160 --> 11:26.720]  separately by some of her associates and friends. She was the head of the Eagle
[11:26.720 --> 11:35.160]  Forum in her state in Georgia. And she had documented cases where CPS and her
[11:35.160 --> 11:39.480]  state get bounties for we want a two year old with black hair, green eyes, or we
[11:39.480 --> 11:44.240]  want to blonde with green eyes or blue eyes and that CPS didn't go trolling
[11:44.240 --> 11:48.800]  through the schools and through the elementary schools and through the day
[11:48.800 --> 11:54.240]  cares. And they're paying bounties on children that the adoption agencies are
[11:54.240 --> 11:59.640]  looking for. And I know she was working on that and her and her husband shot in
[11:59.640 --> 12:05.280]  the head multiple times and oh, now Fox News is reporting. Oh, someone said they
[12:05.280 --> 12:09.680]  had a suicide pack that he had cancer. Yeah, a conservative, the head of the
[12:09.680 --> 12:13.640]  Eagle Forum in Georgia told no one this, but then magically it's kind of like
[12:13.640 --> 12:19.040]  so called friends of Gary Webb, who pulled surprise winner on CIA drug
[12:19.040 --> 12:22.600]  trafficking. He had people break it in and out of his house. He had to move
[12:22.600 --> 12:26.240]  because of it. He wouldn't even have his children over to his house anymore. He
[12:26.240 --> 12:33.120]  was divorced because of the danger. They shot him twice in the head. I mean, I
[12:33.120 --> 12:37.920]  wanted on record, ladies and gentlemen, that there will be no murder suicides
[12:37.920 --> 12:44.040]  ever. If they do that, it's staged. Okay, bottom line. And this is how they do
[12:44.040 --> 12:49.080]  it. And I just prayed a God to protect us, but I'm committed. I'm not even
[12:49.080 --> 12:54.600]  afraid. We're going in through and beyond. And I'm trying to be as wise as a
[12:54.600 --> 12:56.680]  serpent and peaceful as a dove here.
[13:00.160 --> 13:06.040]  We also got a phone call. And again, this happened right before airtime.
[13:10.720 --> 13:11.360]  And
[13:11.360 --> 13:20.400]  we got contacted by a gentleman in Tennessee who said that someone had
[13:20.400 --> 13:25.360]  broken into his computer and was trying to spoof his IP address or somehow got
[13:25.360 --> 13:30.920]  his data and then was posting it on info wars dot com over the weekend. And we
[13:30.920 --> 13:36.000]  went and tracked the IP address. It is not originating from this person who
[13:36.000 --> 13:40.480]  got SWAT team this morning. And that's how easy it is for these people to do
[13:40.480 --> 13:44.320]  this. We've seen cases of teenagers being charged with the Patriot Act and
[13:44.320 --> 13:48.320]  it's clear evidence that they weren't even home at the time with this IP
[13:48.320 --> 13:53.360]  spoofing. This is just where I had this happen to me a long time ago back
[13:53.360 --> 14:01.320]  during 1996 97. All the major radio and TV stations in Austin would call me.
[14:01.920 --> 14:08.560]  Thank God they called me before they called the police. And it's very easy
[14:08.560 --> 14:14.080]  to reprogram a fax machine to have if you have a public comment line number.
[14:14.080 --> 14:18.080]  That's what they did. They took my public comment line from the radio show
[14:18.080 --> 14:24.680]  and TV show and they would program my name and my number in and then send
[14:24.680 --> 14:26.080]  threatening faxes around.
[14:32.520 --> 14:35.840]  Again, this is all psychological warfare meant to get people off
[14:35.840 --> 14:39.720]  balance meant to harass people. WikiLeaks is being followed is being
[14:39.720 --> 14:43.760]  harassed all over the world in Europe and in Iceland where it's based.
[14:43.760 --> 14:47.160]  They put out an emergency alert on.
[14:50.240 --> 14:56.320]  Friday. We linked to another WikiLeaks story Friday, so I'm not sure if
[14:56.320 --> 14:59.960]  these attacks are over that or over the CNN situation, but it seems to be
[14:59.960 --> 15:16.040]  associated with the CNN situation. But we link to a CIA report, which the
[15:16.040 --> 15:19.840]  government admits is real about how they count on our apathy. And they know
[15:19.840 --> 15:23.760]  the wars are unpopular and the police state's unpopular. But it talks about
[15:23.760 --> 15:27.440]  their propaganda points, how they're going to propagandize. And this is
[15:27.440 --> 15:31.280]  from a year ago. You can see all those propaganda points on the news every
[15:31.280 --> 15:35.880]  night. It's just totally disgusting how they manipulate people, how they're
[15:35.880 --> 15:37.160]  involved domestically.
[15:41.840 --> 15:46.120]  But they're very bold, ladies and gentlemen, and they like double edged
[15:46.120 --> 15:49.480]  messages. They don't care and they're getting to the point where they don't
[15:49.480 --> 15:56.120]  care if they set me up with God knows what horrible thing or kill me. They
[15:56.120 --> 16:03.080]  don't care if most of you know that it's staged because that's a message to
[16:03.080 --> 16:06.520]  you who are awake. And then for the dumbed down public, they have put
[16:06.520 --> 16:11.200]  themselves in kind of an Orwellian crime stop. That guys, will you pull up
[16:11.200 --> 16:13.520]  the definition of crime stop for me, please?
[16:13.520 --> 16:30.920]  Yeah. Crime stop. Where people know they're living in tyranny, but they lie
[16:30.920 --> 16:35.360]  to themselves and they rationalize and always make excuses. And when you've
[16:35.360 --> 16:38.560]  done this enough times, it just gets to where you automatically accept
[16:38.560 --> 16:43.960]  anything. No matter how insane. Oh, here's video of cops beating up a guy who's
[16:43.960 --> 16:46.720]  a quadriplegic because he won't get up out of the, he won't follow their
[16:46.720 --> 16:49.640]  order to get up out of the wheelchair. And he's saying I'm paralyzed. They go
[16:49.640 --> 16:54.040]  ahead and beat him up. How many of those videos are out there? Or Oh, court
[16:54.040 --> 16:57.120]  rules, the police can torture you with a taser to make you ask questions. What
[16:57.120 --> 17:00.800]  about the Fifth Amendment? That's associated press headline. Court rules,
[17:00.800 --> 17:04.480]  they can use tasers to make you answer questions. Court rules, police can
[17:04.480 --> 17:12.240]  taser pregnant women. Court rules on and on and on and on. And they just throw
[17:12.240 --> 17:17.160]  it in your face. Last week, it came out that the Russian government called
[17:17.160 --> 17:24.480]  for spraying the poppy fields with pesticide to kill them. And NATO said,
[17:24.480 --> 17:33.600]  Oh, no, that would hurt the poppy farmers. And I've got articles on that front.
[17:36.920 --> 17:42.840]  But here's the definition of crime stop crime. Stop is a new speak term taken
[17:42.840 --> 17:46.520]  from the novel 1984 by George Arwell. It means to rid oneself of unwanted
[17:46.520 --> 17:50.400]  thoughts. I thoughts that interfere with the ideology of the party. This way a
[17:50.400 --> 17:53.880]  person avoids committing thought crime. In the novel, we hear about crime
[17:53.880 --> 17:57.800]  stop through the eyes of protagonist Winston Smith. The mind should develop a
[17:57.800 --> 18:03.240]  blind spot. Whenever a dangerous thought present itself, the process should be
[18:03.240 --> 18:07.800]  automatic, instinctive crime stop. They called it a new speak. He set to work
[18:07.800 --> 18:12.920]  to exercise himself in crime stop. He presented himself with propositions.
[18:12.920 --> 18:16.720]  The party says the earth is flat. The party says the ice is heavier than
[18:16.720 --> 18:21.920]  water and trained himself in not seeing or not understanding the arguments that
[18:21.920 --> 18:25.680]  contradicted them or will also describe crime stop from the perspective of
[18:25.680 --> 18:32.560]  manual Goldstein in the book, the theory and practice of collectivism oligarchal
[18:32.560 --> 18:39.280]  collectivism. Crime stop means the faculty in the facility of stopping short as
[18:39.280 --> 18:42.400]  through by instinct at the threshold of any dangerous thought. It includes the
[18:42.400 --> 18:47.640]  power of not grasping analogies of failing to perceive logical errors of
[18:47.640 --> 18:53.280]  misunderstanding. The simplest arguments of they are inimical bull to ink
[18:53.280 --> 19:00.760]  soccer English socialism and of being bored or repelled by any train of
[19:00.760 --> 19:05.520]  thought, which is capable of leading in a heretical direction. Crime stop in
[19:05.520 --> 19:11.760]  short means protective stupidity. And you start telling people, Hey, they're
[19:11.760 --> 19:14.240]  announcing world government. They're going to tax everything you do. They're
[19:14.240 --> 19:17.080]  going to track every facility or life. They're brainwashing your kids and
[19:17.080 --> 19:20.720]  turning them against you. This is classical tyranny and people yawn and
[19:20.720 --> 19:26.280]  their eyes glaze over. It's like you're going to your seven year old or eight
[19:26.280 --> 19:32.160]  year old and saying clean up your room and they suddenly get tired and or like
[19:32.160 --> 19:36.640]  you tell a dog, get off the couch and it acts like it can't hear you and it
[19:36.640 --> 19:39.760]  acts like it's asleep suddenly. It can have its ears up and be all excited.
[19:39.760 --> 19:43.560]  You'll get off the couch and it rolls over and lays there and acts like it
[19:43.560 --> 19:48.400]  can't hear you or it starts moving real slow to get off. I mean, all mammals do
[19:48.400 --> 19:56.000]  this. But it's the it's a false instinct of not preserving yourself as if
[19:56.000 --> 20:01.760]  standing up is is is work or something instead of survival. You can't live
[20:01.760 --> 20:05.400]  without food, can't live without water. You can't live without being prepared and

[21:21.200 --> 21:24.800]  opportunity for Americans. With the passage of the sweeping health care reform,
[21:24.800 --> 21:27.800]  working middle class Americans are getting the short end of the stick. The
[21:27.800 --> 21:31.480]  health care mandate will require almost every American to be insured or else pay
[21:31.480 --> 21:35.240]  a fine. This means less control over your finances, take back control by
[21:35.240 --> 21:39.120]  treading in precious metals. Gold and silver have always been and continues to
[21:39.120 --> 21:43.360]  be the leading way to protect against our weakening markets. Call Midas Resources

[22:14.600 --> 22:18.560]  world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[22:18.560 --> 22:22.840]  It means all the world under their control. The United Nations would take
[22:22.840 --> 22:27.960]  over America. The Trilateral Commission would control the world. Invisible Empire
[22:27.960 --> 22:31.560]  chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for
[22:31.560 --> 22:35.880]  centuries to establish an oppressive world government. I believe first of all
[22:35.880 --> 22:39.400]  that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[22:39.400 --> 22:43.440]  financial system. Global governance with the establishment of the G20. So it's
[22:43.440 --> 22:47.600]  going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else. And I got news for

[24:03.320 --> 24:16.720]  You look like an angel. Walk like an angel. Talk like an angel. But I got one.
[24:16.720 --> 24:25.960]  The government. You're the devil in the sky. The devil right out in the open. Oh yes you are.
[24:26.640 --> 24:34.040]  Okay. Former state senator Nancy Schaefer exposing government child
[24:34.040 --> 24:38.600]  kidnapping range. She was shot in the back or husband shot in the chest. Her
[24:38.600 --> 24:43.520]  daughter's on record saying her dad didn't have cancer. Fox News is just
[24:43.520 --> 24:50.000]  running around saying that definitely a hit. Head of the Eagle Forum had new
[24:50.000 --> 24:54.280]  information to come out about the government grabbing people's children
[24:54.280 --> 24:57.680]  and they just sent a hit team over there to murder. The government says look
[24:57.680 --> 25:00.040]  we'll take your kids when we want them. You understand that you think it'll
[25:00.040 --> 25:04.520]  stand up against us? We ship in the drugs. We ship in the kids. We make the
[25:04.520 --> 25:09.320]  snuff films. We put poison in your water. We're the psychopaths. We're taking
[25:09.320 --> 25:15.560]  America over. We're going to kill whoever we want. Period. They want a violent
[25:15.560 --> 25:20.000]  confrontation. They are pushing it because the average cop isn't bad. And then
[25:20.000 --> 25:23.200]  if people start fighting with the police then they can turn all the police
[25:23.200 --> 25:27.080]  completely against the American people and have a giant war which will then
[25:27.080 --> 25:30.680]  chew up the police and military and then they'll bring in even more
[25:30.680 --> 25:34.560]  oppressive measures and bring in foreign assets which they've been training in
[25:34.560 --> 25:39.360]  L.E.O.9 last year, 14 different countries to quote take on American terrorist. They've
[25:39.360 --> 25:44.400]  signed agreements under S.P.P. Security Prosperity Partnership and now they're
[25:44.400 --> 25:49.440]  going to start arresting a lot of militia people. They've got plants everywhere. I
[25:49.440 --> 25:56.880]  mean, Jaron isn't in a militia. Jaron's a radio producer I hired from a local
[25:56.880 --> 26:01.960]  talk station and it doesn't matter what bar he goes to by himself. Just the same
[26:01.960 --> 26:05.400]  guy comes in and sits down and starts talking about Alex Jones and you know
[26:05.400 --> 26:10.280]  how we need to basically go after Obama. I mean it just happens to all of us. I
[26:10.280 --> 26:14.200]  can't go anywhere. I can be on an exercise machine at the gym and somebody
[26:14.200 --> 26:17.320]  walks over and acts like they don't know who I am. It's always some copper informant.
[26:17.320 --> 26:23.880]  These people are so criminal. God help us. God help us. These people are so
[26:23.880 --> 26:32.800]  evil. I mean, Jaron can go to a tiny dive bar. He'll make a beer and watch a
[26:32.800 --> 26:41.000]  football game and there'll be five people and it's just ongoing and you
[26:41.000 --> 26:43.840]  got all these militias and people that are concerned and they get guns and
[26:43.840 --> 26:49.000]  they're all paranoid and then they go to church or they go to the bar or they go
[26:49.000 --> 26:53.400]  to the video store or wherever and people just walk up and say, don't you think we
[26:53.400 --> 26:56.840]  got to do something violent? Yeah, I'm getting sick of the government. I agree.
[26:56.840 --> 27:00.760]  We might need to someday. That's it. You're going to prison. They're going to plant
[27:00.760 --> 27:06.320]  pipe bombs on you. They've done it over and over again. That's why it's just so
[27:06.320 --> 27:10.240]  obvious. Anyone who's on the radio calling for violence who isn't
[27:10.240 --> 27:15.800]  instantly arrested is a fed. Hal turned it in for a decade. All the major white
[27:15.800 --> 27:20.080]  supremacists sides that spend 24 seven attacking Australia. Every single stink
[27:20.080 --> 27:26.400]  and wantoms fed run. And they're there to find out who's who and they just I
[27:26.400 --> 27:30.760]  mean, folks, I knew last year with it's why I keep talking about it. It's the key
[27:30.760 --> 27:35.080]  piece of Intel and it adds into everything else we're seeing. I'm gonna
[27:35.080 --> 27:38.720]  walk through it coming up in the next segment, but within two hours of
[27:38.720 --> 27:43.760]  the ploskey being arrested in Pittsburgh, gunning down three cops. The news was
[27:43.760 --> 27:48.640]  reporting through the reporter who was handled by the Southern Poverty Law
[27:48.640 --> 27:52.200]  Center in ADL. That's that's his beat. That's what he writes about demonizing
[27:52.200 --> 27:57.760]  locals that the ploskey liked me and basically did it because of me and I
[27:57.760 --> 28:02.080]  had to threaten some lawsuits and five newspapers had to retract. Southern
[28:02.080 --> 28:05.280]  Poverty Law Center doesn't care. ADL doesn't care. Turned out the white
[28:05.280 --> 28:09.280]  supremacists hated my guts and attacked me everywhere. Stormfront, you name it.
[28:09.280 --> 28:13.200]  And on my own website, we went and found his comments and we showed the media and
[28:13.200 --> 28:17.320]  said, look, he's saying I'm scum. I'm not calling for violence. I'm not any
[28:17.320 --> 28:23.240]  Semitic. And so the ADL Southern Poverty Law Center knew that they had people on
[28:23.240 --> 28:26.720]  the streets within hours coming up to cameras smiling saying, yeah, he likes
[28:26.720 --> 28:32.080]  Alex Jones, just totally staged. And that's pretty creepy because these people
[28:32.080 --> 28:35.960]  don't play games. Southern Poverty Law Center was running Elohim City where
[28:35.960 --> 28:43.720]  McVay was at. And I know that I'm a big boy. It's just still to be this deep
[28:43.720 --> 28:49.320]  into it. And now knowing the time we're going into the trials and tribulations
[28:50.280 --> 28:54.440]  that we're all going to have to go through. But because we've exposed them,
[28:54.440 --> 28:58.560]  look, they hate me because as I say, I've got their number. And I really
[28:58.560 --> 29:02.760]  understand how they operate in their, their methodologies, their systems,
[29:03.360 --> 29:08.320]  how they repeat the same operations over and over again because they found
[29:08.320 --> 29:10.600]  their effective on the public. And we've been ruining some of those
[29:10.600 --> 29:16.680]  operations. We've been ruining their false flag terror attack. And when the
[29:16.680 --> 29:19.880]  when governments do it, whether it's the Japanese or the Russians or the US or
[29:19.880 --> 29:26.120]  Israel or England or the French or the Italians, we we cover the truth. We
[29:26.120 --> 29:30.360]  are truly independence here. And we just want freedom. I mean, I don't want a
[29:30.360 --> 29:34.360]  criminal government run by foreign banks robbing everyone and then the police
[29:34.360 --> 29:37.320]  and military need to understand something. They're announcing they're
[29:37.320 --> 29:40.640]  going to take the pension funds now in Business Week Bloomberg and the
[29:40.640 --> 29:45.280]  Associated Press. I mean, you are definitely working for totally evil
[29:45.280 --> 29:47.880]  government. You need to understand that and choose sides right now.
[29:50.640 --> 29:56.880]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[29:56.880 --> 29:57.400]  network.
[30:00.040 --> 30:03.200]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now
[30:03.200 --> 30:06.400]  storing non hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic
[30:06.400 --> 30:10.080]  Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown, non hybrid seeds can become
[30:10.080 --> 30:13.520]  more valuable than silver or gold? It's true. Seeds have all performed even
[30:13.520 --> 30:16.520]  gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even
[30:16.520 --> 30:20.480]  happen again. So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the
[30:20.480 --> 30:25.360]  perfect mix of non hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank, and it
[30:25.360 --> 30:29.280]  can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your
[30:29.280 --> 30:32.440]  family. And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically
[30:32.440 --> 30:36.280]  modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full
[30:36.280 --> 30:41.120]  acre crisis garden. So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's
[30:41.120 --> 30:51.520]  survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365.
[30:51.880 --> 30:56.960]  Remember, in a real crisis, non hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This
[30:56.960 --> 30:59.280]  is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[30:59.280 --> 31:05.080]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[31:05.080 --> 31:10.400]  Charity is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality. It
[31:10.400 --> 31:15.280]  really says that the state is God. The United States has now recognized globally
[31:15.280 --> 31:19.000]  as one of the most oppressive police states on earth. This film
[31:19.000 --> 31:23.160]  conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now
[31:23.160 --> 31:27.480]  being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity
[31:27.480 --> 31:31.360]  of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state. Police
[31:31.360 --> 31:34.960]  state four chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.

[32:30.960 --> 32:35.200]  If you notice that most times here at the drug ads on TV, they have a list of
[32:35.200 --> 32:38.520]  possible side effects, I find that if you're going to take something that is
[32:38.520 --> 32:42.520]  you're trading one problem for five or six other problems, that to me doesn't
[32:42.520 --> 32:46.920]  make sense. Using something that is natural, that is absorbed into the body,
[32:46.920 --> 32:49.920]  particularly because in a liquid form, I think it's the best way to go.

[33:14.920 --> 33:21.120]  In the shadow of the night, I have all these moments of extreme clarity and
[33:21.120 --> 33:26.760]  understanding and important things I want to talk about here on air. Then I get
[33:26.760 --> 33:31.440]  on air and there's all the news, all the information, every point that I research.
[33:31.440 --> 33:36.360]  I have to use a lot of brain power to analyze it and then comment on it. I'm
[33:36.360 --> 33:41.440]  not complaining, but it's a strange feeling to not be afraid of even being
[33:41.440 --> 33:48.600]  imprisoned or tortured or having my name destroyed or even being killed. I just
[33:48.600 --> 33:56.960]  put it in God's hands. But the only feeling I have is one of frustration
[33:56.960 --> 34:03.160]  and anger at myself for not doing a better job over the years and all the
[34:03.160 --> 34:08.800]  mistakes I've made. And I know nobody's perfect and I tend to always just look
[34:08.800 --> 34:13.800]  forward and learn from my mistakes and deal with the issues at hand. It's just
[34:13.800 --> 34:20.520]  there's so much I want to say to you. So many things I want to telegraph. Number
[34:20.520 --> 34:26.920]  one, I love humanity. I'm a fan of humankind and I love innocence and I
[34:26.920 --> 34:31.560]  love goodness and I love everything that's wholesome and ask not who the
[34:31.560 --> 34:37.960]  bell tolls for you. No man is an island in and of themselves. I
[34:37.960 --> 34:42.280]  realize that. I realize all these people who were compartmentalized, dumbed down,
[34:42.280 --> 34:50.400]  conditioned, brainwashed to serve whatever part of the cog they filled. I
[34:50.400 --> 34:54.760]  realize most of them aren't evil or bad. They're just petty. They're small. They're
[34:54.760 --> 35:04.440]  on ego trips. And I know that if I could really show them what I know, show them
[35:04.440 --> 35:07.160]  what I've discovered in life, show if they could experience what I've
[35:07.160 --> 35:10.040]  experienced, if they could see the things I've seen and I know they've seen
[35:10.040 --> 35:16.520]  things I haven't seen that shape them, that this wouldn't have to happen. All
[35:16.520 --> 35:23.160]  of this wouldn't have to go down this way. But I know this. I'm a good person and
[35:23.160 --> 35:32.280]  I love liberty and I love life. And I must oppose the works of darkness, the
[35:32.280 --> 35:36.840]  works of the New World Order. That's who I am. That's what I do. It isn't even a
[35:36.840 --> 35:45.320]  conscious decision. It's in my bones. It's in my guts. But seeing things
[35:45.320 --> 35:54.920]  accelerating, unraveling, coming closer to hot oppression, not not cold creeping
[35:54.920 --> 36:10.360]  oppression, but hot oppression, explosive oppression. It forces me to really get
[36:10.360 --> 36:24.840]  real and to want to get on my knees to God and repent, repent for things I've
[36:24.840 --> 36:31.240]  done, for thoughts I've had, repent for how weak I am and repent for everybody
[36:31.240 --> 36:38.280]  else's weakness. I mean, I try to be honest with myself. I try to face evil. I try
[36:38.280 --> 36:42.920]  to face evil in the world. I don't engage in crime stop. I don't engage in
[36:42.920 --> 36:53.080]  rationalizing what's going on. And I'm so alive. I almost can't stand it. You know
[36:53.080 --> 37:02.440]  what I mean? It's just to understand, to know. I think there's a passage somewhere
[37:02.440 --> 37:10.360]  in the Bible. The beginning of wisdom is sorrow. You guys pull up that exact
[37:10.360 --> 37:19.800]  passage. Wisdom and sorrow, Bible verse. Because I can see all the beauty in the
[37:19.800 --> 37:25.160]  world. The evil controllers can see it as well. I mean, how many times on air?
[37:25.160 --> 37:31.160]  Hundreds. Have I talked about how there's all this creeping corruption and
[37:31.160 --> 37:48.600]  oppression and injustice and bullying that goes on in the world?
[37:48.600 --> 37:56.920]  But it's all mixed in with beautiful trees in the blue sky and sunshine and the
[37:56.920 --> 38:04.200]  light cool spring wind and the smell of flowers.
[38:04.200 --> 38:11.320]  And not just the birds singing, but wheeling through the sky.
[38:11.320 --> 38:15.160]  We have at our house a bunch of
[38:15.160 --> 38:21.320]  swallows, little blue back swallows with little gold bronze chest. And they nest
[38:21.320 --> 38:26.760]  every year and have their babies. And the babies live in the same house about
[38:26.760 --> 38:31.000]  three years. And so now I know several generations of the birds. So they all
[38:31.000 --> 38:35.800]  like us and know us and land just a foot or two away from us and look
[38:35.800 --> 38:44.200]  approvingly at us. And it just makes me want to cry.
[38:44.200 --> 38:51.240]  But it isn't physically crying. I'm crying in my heart.
[38:51.240 --> 38:55.800]  And I just want to protect all the innocent things, all the good things.
[38:55.800 --> 38:59.160]  I mean, I've been raised in this evil world. You've been raised in this evil
[38:59.160 --> 39:03.720]  world and it gets more and more wicked by degrees every minute
[39:03.720 --> 39:07.720]  as we get sucked into a black hole of
[39:07.720 --> 39:16.600]  death and destruction. I mean, look at world history. We know where we're going.
[39:16.600 --> 39:20.120]  It's like we're in a motorboat going 80 miles an hour across a lake towards an
[39:20.120 --> 39:25.000]  island with big rocks. And I'm saying to people, look where we're
[39:25.000 --> 39:32.440]  going. We better slow down. We better change course.
[39:32.440 --> 39:38.920]  And there's this slight memory,
[39:39.160 --> 39:46.200]  this slight memory of cowardice. It's a nostalgia. It's a alternate reality,
[39:46.200 --> 39:52.760]  nostalgia, of what if I would have just been a rancher or a
[39:52.760 --> 39:56.360]  salesman or a professor?
[39:56.360 --> 40:03.000]  What if I never would have been involved in any of this? Then I wouldn't be in the
[40:03.000 --> 40:06.120]  danger I'm in right now.
[40:12.120 --> 40:19.240]  But instantly, I realize that's not even my own thought. It's on a heartfelt
[40:19.240 --> 40:22.360]  thought. It isn't who I am. It's just my brain
[40:22.360 --> 40:28.200]  analyzing the past. I am the person that made these
[40:28.200 --> 40:31.080]  decisions. I wouldn't have met my wife if I hadn't
[40:31.080 --> 40:34.440]  taken the course. I would have a different wife or
[40:34.440 --> 40:40.440]  different children. In eternity, I am who I am.
[40:40.440 --> 40:46.360]  In eternity, I made the decisions I made. In eternity, I put it all on the line
[40:46.360 --> 40:52.120]  as best I could and I put it all in God's hands.
[40:52.120 --> 40:54.920]  In eternity.
[40:57.800 --> 41:03.880]  And so the course I'm on is set. My destiny, whatever God has in store for me,
[41:03.880 --> 41:07.640]  is set. And I want to reach out to all of you who are
[41:07.640 --> 41:10.360]  new listeners out there or who are working for the government right now,
[41:10.360 --> 41:17.960]  tuned into this radio show. I want to ask you to be still.
[41:17.960 --> 41:23.240]  This afternoon, tonight, tomorrow, to close the
[41:23.240 --> 41:30.760]  shades, to sit in a chair in the twilight
[41:30.760 --> 41:34.360]  and realize we are at the twilight of our civilization, our society
[41:34.360 --> 41:38.680]  right now. If we don't turn back soon, ladies and gentlemen,
[41:38.680 --> 41:41.800]  if we turn back, it's going to be hell on earth. If we don't turn back, it's
[41:41.800 --> 41:46.040]  going to be the likes of which humanity has never seen.
[41:46.040 --> 41:49.720]  And everyone knows that in their gut. And a lot of you just keep your head down
[41:49.720 --> 41:52.920]  in the government. You just try to do your job. You try to not be evil.
[41:52.920 --> 41:56.360]  And that's what's holding back the evil is people outside the government and in
[41:56.360 --> 41:59.000]  the government and people inside the corporations and outside the
[41:59.000 --> 42:03.320]  corporations inside these gangs, these corporate systems
[42:03.320 --> 42:07.480]  who haven't given yourselves over to peer pressure
[42:07.480 --> 42:12.360]  to go along with corruption. And so all the movie stars and shows like 24 and
[42:12.360 --> 42:16.920]  all these programs tell you the new hero does torture. The new hero is bad. The
[42:16.920 --> 42:20.200]  new hero does evil things, but for a greater good,
[42:20.200 --> 42:24.440]  they are attempting to traffic in your soul. I mean, have you read in revelations
[42:24.440 --> 42:29.320]  the great merchants of the world trafficked in the souls of men?
[42:29.320 --> 42:32.280]  They trafficked in brainwashing you from birth,
[42:32.280 --> 42:39.400]  in conditioning you, into destroying who you would have been.
[42:39.400 --> 42:43.560]  And so I'm not afraid to die. I'm not afraid to be killed.
[42:43.560 --> 42:46.600]  God forbid, I love my children more than anything in the world,
[42:46.600 --> 42:49.480]  but it's in God's hands that they're not going to have a future
[42:49.480 --> 42:52.760]  if I don't fight these people. You're not going to have a future
[42:52.760 --> 42:55.880]  if we don't fight these people.
[42:56.440 --> 43:02.520]  And I want those evil individuals who haven't fully given themselves over
[43:02.520 --> 43:08.280]  and harden their hearts to corruption. If any of this is reaching you,
[43:08.280 --> 43:13.160]  it isn't too late to turn back.
[43:13.160 --> 43:17.800]  It isn't too late to look around you at the majesty and the mystery of the
[43:17.800 --> 43:21.320]  universe. Last night I was out under the
[43:21.320 --> 43:26.840]  stars. It was one of the clearest nights in years
[43:26.840 --> 43:29.560]  in the city.
[43:32.280 --> 43:36.120]  And I was looking at the moon and Saturn and Mars
[43:36.120 --> 43:43.240]  and Orion's belt and the cool wind and the green grass and just the smell
[43:43.240 --> 43:48.280]  of the life going on around me and how good it is. I mean we know what's good
[43:48.280 --> 43:53.960]  and we know what's bad. And we know black helmets and ski mask is bad. We
[43:53.960 --> 43:59.560]  know cameras in the schools and in the laptops watching us is bad.
[43:59.560 --> 44:03.640]  We know that government lying incessantly and robbing and stealing is
[44:03.640 --> 44:07.800]  bad. And we know it's getting worse. And the most
[44:07.800 --> 44:13.400]  important thing I can say to people out there that serve the dark side is
[44:14.360 --> 44:18.680]  the media and the culture have sold the dark side as
[44:18.680 --> 44:26.680]  powerful and as commanding. Look at all the villains.
[44:26.680 --> 44:33.960]  They're handsome. They're smart. They're powerful. They're Darth Vader.
[44:35.240 --> 44:38.920]  And so from a young age children identify with that.
[44:38.920 --> 44:42.120]  They identify with Cobra Commander. And 20 years later they wear a Cobra
[44:42.120 --> 44:46.120]  Commander uniform. It's now the police uniform. And the Pentagon admits it's
[44:46.120 --> 44:50.680]  all pre-programmed. This is declassified.
[44:50.680 --> 44:58.520]  It's pure evil. They have taken who you are
[44:58.520 --> 45:02.200]  and they have twisted it and turned you into an artificial
[45:02.200 --> 45:07.720]  psychopath. They've robbed you of all the discernment
[45:07.720 --> 45:11.560]  and all the gentleness that you would have had.
[45:11.560 --> 45:15.960]  Because there is a duality. You know you'll find
[45:15.960 --> 45:18.360]  not just in human psychology but in all mammal
[45:18.360 --> 45:23.320]  behavior. You know the more aggressive species, the stronger species
[45:23.320 --> 45:29.720]  also are more loving with their pack or their herd or their group.
[45:29.720 --> 45:32.440]  Because if they weren't, if they didn't have that loving side,
[45:32.440 --> 45:36.520]  they would turn those predatory instincts against their own species.
[45:36.520 --> 45:40.280]  And so humans have this as well.
[45:40.280 --> 45:49.720]  You are much stronger when you are in tune with
[45:49.720 --> 45:54.360]  the love. You're not weak.
[45:56.280 --> 46:00.280]  I mean this system is driven by fear. These FBI agents and ATF agents and all
[46:00.280 --> 46:04.520]  of them, they're scared to death for their lives.
[46:05.800 --> 46:08.920]  All they've got is their worldly things and their ego.
[46:08.920 --> 46:12.200]  And once they give into it, all it is is avarice and envy and it's the same for
[46:12.200 --> 46:18.120]  the general public. And there are better things in the
[46:18.120 --> 46:22.280]  world that will actually fulfill you.
[46:23.240 --> 46:27.400]  And look, I'm not up here on a high horse. I'm not up here on the mountain
[46:27.400 --> 46:33.800]  like I'm some monk or something or Buddha under a tree.
[46:33.800 --> 46:40.360]  I know you.
[46:41.000 --> 46:46.360]  I know you because I've been there.
[46:50.600 --> 46:53.880]  I know what you're thinking.
[46:53.880 --> 47:05.720]  I mean my brain has a very dark side. I can see what you see and I know
[47:05.720 --> 47:12.280]  it is not good. Evil is not sexy.
[47:13.480 --> 47:21.080]  Evil is sad. Evil is rotten. Evil stinks like a rotting
[47:21.080 --> 47:24.600]  carcass.
[47:25.720 --> 47:34.120]  Fidelity and honor and goodness
[47:34.120 --> 47:40.520]  instead, fastness and generosity
[47:42.760 --> 47:50.360]  is what we're really meant for. And changing our world
[47:50.360 --> 47:53.480]  is an inside job. Everything's an inside job.
[47:53.480 --> 48:02.920]  We have to change ourselves one person at a time, one thought at a time.
[48:03.720 --> 48:07.640]  It is that angel on one shoulder and that devil on the other.
[48:07.640 --> 48:12.520]  And it's that eternal fight going on in our psyches.
[48:12.520 --> 48:20.760]  It doesn't have to be this way. We don't have to go down this road.
[48:20.760 --> 48:24.280]  This country has never been perfect, but it's been the best example of human
[48:24.280 --> 48:29.000]  liberty in all of recorded civilization. And because we were
[48:29.000 --> 48:32.520]  reaching for something better and something truly
[48:32.520 --> 48:36.440]  wholesome, we have become the enemy of every
[48:36.440 --> 48:43.320]  parasite and every criminal and every individual who harbors
[48:43.320 --> 48:49.960]  the dark energies of Satan. And you're all tied together in your
[48:49.960 --> 48:54.600]  wickedness. You work together as an unseen hand.
[48:54.600 --> 49:00.680]  It's a spirit. You're clicking. You click.
[49:01.240 --> 49:04.280]  And you will forever be enemies of those of us that love
[49:04.280 --> 49:08.360]  the goodness because we don't click.
[49:08.360 --> 49:11.240]  Now a lot of you have been brought into evil and through peer pressure you've
[49:11.240 --> 49:15.960]  gone along with it. You've been manipulated into it.
[49:15.960 --> 49:20.840]  You know that in your heart, in your soul, in your spirit,
[49:20.840 --> 49:23.960]  you want to
[49:25.880 --> 49:30.840]  move away from that black sunshine, that dark silver light of evil,
[49:30.840 --> 49:34.440]  and you want to move back towards God, that all-encompassing,
[49:34.440 --> 49:41.000]  warm, loving light that makes you feel totally fulfilled
[49:41.000 --> 49:48.840]  and strong and gives you a wisdom that spans the deepest
[49:50.280 --> 49:52.840]  corners
[49:53.400 --> 49:56.360]  of creation.
[49:56.360 --> 50:02.760]  If you could ever experience
[50:04.920 --> 50:11.800]  true goodness, you would never have a desire
[50:11.800 --> 50:15.480]  to run headlong towards evil.
[50:15.800 --> 50:19.880]  It is so fulfilling to be on a journey
[50:19.880 --> 50:25.240]  trying to be a better person. It's the heart. It's that you want to be good
[50:25.240 --> 50:28.760]  and you want to change and you want to see.
[50:28.760 --> 50:32.600]  You have to want to understand. You have to let
[50:32.600 --> 50:36.040]  God's discernment into your life.
[50:36.680 --> 50:40.120]  I'm going to stop preaching here
[50:41.160 --> 50:44.760]  and I'm going to come back and get into the Moscow bombings.
[50:44.760 --> 50:48.360]  This great woman who stood up against the government child kidnapping rings
[50:48.360 --> 50:57.000]  clearly murdered with her husband, state senator from Georgia, CNN piece,
[50:57.000 --> 51:00.680]  and a lot more. Stay with us.

[51:29.960 --> 51:32.520]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks,
[51:32.520 --> 51:35.800]  stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[51:35.800 --> 51:39.800]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize
[51:39.800 --> 51:43.640]  the value of gold for your retirement. Gold has outperformed paper investments
[51:43.640 --> 51:46.840]  yet no word about IRAs. If you would like to have gold for your
[51:46.840 --> 51:51.640]  retirement, call 800-686-2237. Don't get left behind by rising
[51:51.640 --> 51:55.880]  inflation in low returns, call 800-686-2237.
[51:55.880 --> 52:00.440]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[52:00.440 --> 52:05.080]  They helped to create a new world order. We are part of a new world order.
[52:05.080 --> 52:08.360]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[52:08.360 --> 52:12.440]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words
[52:12.440 --> 52:15.480]  and documents. The new world order really is a tool
[52:15.480 --> 52:19.240]  for addressing a new world of possibilities. It means all the world
[52:19.240 --> 52:23.160]  under their control. The United Nations would take over America.
[52:23.160 --> 52:27.880]  The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world. Invisible Empire chronicles
[52:27.880 --> 52:31.480]  how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[52:31.480 --> 52:35.320]  to establish an oppressive world government. I believe first of all
[52:35.320 --> 52:38.520]  that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[52:38.520 --> 52:41.320]  financial system. Global governance with the establishment
[52:41.320 --> 52:44.600]  of the G20. So it's going to be an inner ruling elite
[52:44.600 --> 52:48.360]  and then everyone else. And I got news for you. You're everyone else.

[54:14.680 --> 54:16.360]  I know in my gut
[54:16.360 --> 54:24.360]  that they murdered former state senator Nancy Shaffer. She was shot in the back,
[54:24.360 --> 54:27.320]  her husband in the chest. That's not how people murder suicide.
[54:28.440 --> 54:33.000]  The media lied and said it was a suicide pact. Her husband had cancer. Her daughter said that's
[54:33.000 --> 54:41.240]  not true. And she was really investigating and working on CPS, getting bounties for certain
[54:41.240 --> 54:46.120]  children. They literally go out grocery shopping for your children.
[54:49.480 --> 54:58.040]  I'm just, I don't, I just can't stand all these sickening, disgusting people and all these hitmen
[54:58.040 --> 55:03.000]  and all these murderers and all these people that get off on what they do and just
[55:06.040 --> 55:10.680]  the government controllers that blew up the World Trade Centers in front of everybody. And
[55:10.680 --> 55:15.720]  I've got this Reuters article where they admit the U.S. is protecting the poppy fields and doesn't
[55:15.720 --> 55:22.760]  want to destroy them. That's Reuters. Again, six months ago or so, I heard BBC admit what I already
[55:22.760 --> 55:32.280]  knew. I was driving down the road listening to BBC on XM. And they were just announcing that,
[55:32.280 --> 55:37.960]  oh, well, they don't eradicate the poppies because then the farmers would turn to the
[55:37.960 --> 55:43.720]  Taliban. It was the Taliban that was destroying it. One group of the Taliban, the more modern Taliban,
[55:43.720 --> 55:57.080]  the non-CIA Taliban. I mean, they openly grow the opium and opium is illegal in the U.S.
[55:58.680 --> 56:05.000]  because they want to keep the price up. I mean, this is all elementary. And they're making close
[56:05.000 --> 56:13.480]  to $500 billion globally off heroin every year. It's $500 billion heroin cocaine in the U.S. alone.
[56:15.160 --> 56:21.800]  And they ship the stuff in and they make it look cool. The media pushes it like it's cool and
[56:23.000 --> 56:27.400]  while at the same time attacking it to make it look like it's the radical thing to do.
[56:27.400 --> 56:36.200]  So you'll use it. I mean, it's just, it's just a joke. It's all a sick joke.
[56:37.560 --> 56:41.000]  The government openly, I'm going to cover that story later.
[56:44.520 --> 56:45.480]  I mean, look at this.
[56:45.480 --> 56:59.000]  Indictment militia members sought to levy war against U.S. In three states, Michigan,
[56:59.000 --> 57:02.040]  Indiana, Illinois, and Ohio, excuse me, four states now,
[57:04.840 --> 57:11.080]  but they were going to quote levy war. And you can't believe a word of what the government says
[57:11.080 --> 57:16.760]  because they've been caught so many times that the leader, it will end up, in every case we've seen,
[57:16.760 --> 57:22.200]  use a government agent and then challenge people. You're not a Christian. You're not a man unless
[57:22.200 --> 57:32.040]  you do this. And it's got the quotes in here where they reportedly in the affidavit said that
[57:32.040 --> 57:37.160]  their goal was to go out and kill a cop at a traffic stop. And then when more cops came ambush
[57:37.160 --> 57:42.200]  them, what did I say a year ago? And then every week since then, I said, they're going, when
[57:42.200 --> 57:48.760]  my report came out, when we got to my report, I said, they're going to stage a tax on police on
[57:48.760 --> 57:56.200]  the roadways. It's a perfect way to cover it up. Perfect way to stage it to then demonize any pro
[57:56.200 --> 58:01.000]  second amendment or anti-new world order groups. They're going to kill cops. I mean, it's elementary
[58:01.800 --> 58:06.280]  because I can go into the mindset of the enemy. I've studied them so much that I can't even
[58:06.280 --> 58:12.680]  study them so much. That's the worst part about this is that I have to constantly focus on these
[58:12.680 --> 58:17.800]  people. And when you stare into the abyss, they say, watch out, you may become the abyss.
[58:18.360 --> 58:22.760]  When you'd answer the devil, devil doesn't change. He changes you. It hasn't changed who I am
[58:23.880 --> 58:31.080]  at my core, but I have to think like these people. I have to know what that is horrible.
[58:31.080 --> 58:37.320]  I'm in the mind of these people constantly. And I couldn't do it without God's help. God help
[58:38.120 --> 58:45.720]  us help. America's number one stories for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[58:46.360 --> 58:54.040]  We are the GCN radio network. Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're
[58:54.040 --> 58:59.160]  going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[58:59.160 --> 59:04.440]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[59:04.440 --> 59:09.800]  Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle
[59:09.800 --> 59:14.200]  starts? When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be
[59:14.200 --> 59:19.080]  any food? Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself,
[59:19.080 --> 59:23.560]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems
[59:23.560 --> 59:28.680]  if you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your
[59:28.680 --> 59:34.440]  life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[59:34.440 --> 59:42.360]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out
[59:42.360 --> 59:58.440]  on the web at eFoodsDirect.com again that number 1-800-409-5633. Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.
[01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:10.600]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers?
[01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:21.160]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:27.320]  I know that most of you don't tune in to hear me wax philosophic.
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:35.160]  So, I'm just going to cover this from end to end when we start the next segment per topic.
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:46.360]  I'm going to get into the CNN piece and my anger at them Friday and why I did what I did because,
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:53.320]  well, I'll explain that in the next segment. Then I'll get into the militia situation, the
[01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:56.120]  setups. This only confirms everything we knew was already going to happen.
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:02.200]  And I'll break that down. The horrible murder and the evidence is overwhelming out of the gates.
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:09.160]  They gunned them down in their house, shot her in the back, shot him in the chest.
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:15.720]  Maybe one out of 50 people from what I've seen over the years tries to commit suicide,
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:25.240]  shoot themselves in the chest. People shoot themselves in the head, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:32.840]  Especially professionals. Sometimes you get white trash in people, shoot themselves, say,
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:39.480]  with a 30-odd six on the stomach. I know somebody did that. A drunken idiot. Didn't kill them.
[01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:49.880]  But no professional white collar people, especially. They shoot themselves in the head.
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:55.000]  And they certainly don't shoot their wife in the back. She was about to come out with big
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:04.200]  info. She tried to get a hold of us months ago about it. That's what I mean. I really
[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:09.160]  kicked myself. But you know what? I'm only human. I can't do all this. I can't do it all.
[01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:16.280]  You know, I read all this news, I analyze it, and then it's kind of like it isn't new for me.
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:19.960]  When I get back up here, that's how I tend to not get into a lot of news I talk about sometimes.
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:24.840]  Because it's hard. And again, I'm not complaining. I'm trying to give you the methodology
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:30.280]  of what's going on in my brain and my personal struggles here.
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:38.600]  You know, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, I talked to him last week. Let's remember to call him today.
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:43.640]  We're supposed to call him today or tomorrow. Get him on Thursday or Friday because he's moving.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  And you know, he basically just said, I just can't focus on this and write two big columns
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:57.800]  every week on the evil and the government staging 9 11 Alex and knowing that he's 71 and
[01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:04.600]  he just can't stand looking at it anymore. I understand. I totally understand.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:18.680]  I understand. I can't blame him. And if more of you would get up off your hind ends and go out and
[01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:25.080]  take action and had faith in yourselves, we would beat these people overnight.
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:32.760]  But we're too concerned with our X boxes and with the football games and with
[01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:39.240]  getting drunk with our neighbors and Lord knows it's fun. Nothing like barbecuing and drinking beer.
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:50.040]  You know, I try to not drink and I don't drink a lot, but I go off and on, you know, drinking
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:55.720]  because it's a distraction. I can dumb myself down for a few hours and
[01:03:58.040 --> 01:03:59.640]  kind of not worry about all this stuff.
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:07.320]  But I can't do that. I've gone four years without smoking cigarettes or drinking
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:20.360]  and before I'm trying to step it up. I'm trying to get really real with you, too.
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:27.960]  I mean, the last hour I've been 100 percent real. I'm always real, but I kind of get fired up and
[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:34.920]  I get subconsciously angry at the system and I'm here having to rant for four hours. It's very
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:39.160]  tiring, so at a subconscious level, I get angry and I get angry because I'm looking at all the
[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:42.440]  stuff they're doing. I don't even want to read all these articles about cops out of control.
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:47.800]  It's pathetic. I hate looking at these videos of you beating women and kids up, people in wheelchairs.
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:53.400]  I mean, I don't even hate you. I'm disgusted by you. You make me sick. What kind of men are you?
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:58.280]  A real man does not like that. They got respect for themselves. Your people make you sick.
[01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:05.640]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:08.360]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world.
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:12.920]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.

[01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:45.720]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:07:57.720 --> 01:08:08.680]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:14.840]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Okay, folks, we just finished the first hour.
[01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:17.400]  We're now into the second segment of the second hour.
[01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:24.760]  We have a state representative coming on who's trying to pass a law in Idaho
[01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:32.760]  against naked body scanners in the state that violate privacy laws, child pornography laws.
[01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:37.080]  I mean, there are resting parents that take photos of their three-year-olds in a bikini in a pool.
[01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:44.760]  But the government can record your naked children. And these TSA people are getting
[01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:51.080]  busted every week, raping children, reportedly raping children, printing off naked copies of
[01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:58.120]  women, laughing at their naked bodies, recording the movie star's naked bodies, asking for autographs
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:07.160]  of it. They're going crazy all over the Western world, saying they're God and pounding their chest,
[01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:09.480]  saying, I have power. I mean, this is on the news.
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:23.160]  And in life, I've noticed that weak people who are cowardly and who have felt powerless
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:26.600]  their whole lives are the very worst people to give a badge and a gun to.
[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:37.960]  It's important for real men. And that means loving strong people who understand it. It
[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:43.560]  isn't even courage. It's being who you are. It's spiritual. It's genetic. It's so many things.
[01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:48.360]  It's important for us to take our country and our world and our families and everything back
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:58.440]  into be leaders. Now, look, I'm not perfect. So I want to be clear here. I'm not up on a high horse
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:05.560]  telling you that you're not strong. You're not good. I'm saying I'm bad as well. We all need
[01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:11.960]  to kick it up a notch and then kick it up another notch. And that only happens when you get right
[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:17.880]  with God. And you notice now that we've lost God in our country, the Christianoid churches,
[01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:22.040]  I can't go in them. I feel a very strong presence of evil in them.
[01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:37.080]  It's important that we bring the spirit of good back into things. And it is a spirit. It's like
[01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:41.800]  a vibe in a room. You walk in a room. It's got a good vibe. Say you're walking around a hotel
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:46.120]  looking for a conference room where a conference is going on. You go in one room. It's got a bad
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:54.600]  feeling on another room. It's got a good feeling. That's a spirit. It's an idea. It's a smell. It's
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:11:02.600]  a taste. It's a feel. And I feel the evil rising. And of course, all the indicators are there as well
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:09.800]  because we're rising. Good is on the March. We're having victory after victory in all the polls
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:15.720]  on every issue, whether it's open borders or banker bailout robberies or fake environmental
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:23.480]  takeovers or healthcare takeover. It doesn't matter on every issue. The population is shifting
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:30.280]  35 years ago. Over 60% of people were for abortion. Now it's over 60% against in every poll.
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:37.320]  On every issue, there is this mass. In fact, the majority of people have their heads screwed on
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:42.760]  pretty straight and we're in a struggle to be good people. They're in a struggle to be honorable.
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:47.320]  They're in a struggle to not be lazy. They're in a struggle to be strong. They're in a struggle to
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:54.200]  do the best they can in life. And there's that 35% or so
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:59.880]  who are on the wrong side of things, but they have a hunger to be in power positions. Good people
[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:04.120]  don't until they realize they're threatened and everything good is threatened in it. You have to
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:09.480]  go and engage these people. I don't want to interface with these people. I don't want to have
[01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:15.640]  to get up on the battlefield every day and look at these people and look at their arrogance and
[01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:23.400]  their worldliness and their enjoyment. I don't want to get up on the battlefield every day and
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:33.240]  look at all the bad works they're engaged in. It's not fun, but I'll tell you what makes it all
[01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:38.120]  worth it that we are turning the tide against these people. And then I see the light of goodness
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:46.360]  and honor. I don't like being praised and I don't like people adoring me, but when I do go to a
[01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:51.160]  gun show or to an event and just the look in these people's eyes and how good they are and how
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:13:02.440]  wholesome they are and how they care and how they're involved and it's night and day going to some
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:07.320]  business meeting, which I rarely do, but sometimes I get talked into it and being around all these
[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:13.560]  worldly people in sharp suits who've got perfect etiquette and know how to be fake and shake hands
[01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:22.680]  and act cool and talk about golf and the right sports teams and make jokes. It's not real.
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:31.480]  And that's what this world is. It's about imposing a fake paradigm down onto the people
[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:36.040]  by increments, twisting us, beguiling us, seducing us slowly
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:46.200]  until we're creatures of the dark side. Now, it'll take probably three segments to
[01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:52.280]  play all of this and stop it and comment on it. And then I'm going to get into the
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:58.520]  railway subway bombings in Russia. Former Senator Nancy Schaefer shot to death with husband,
[01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:04.440]  clearly murdered, indictment militia members sought to levy war against U.S. raids in four
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:08.600]  states and other raids we've confirmed in places like Tennessee.
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:19.000]  There's a special unit inside the NSA. This got declassified last year that goes after
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:25.720]  9-11 truthers and people in the government. And we got some evidence that they fired a member of the
[01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:35.720]  NSA. And what they did is they went and spoofed his IP address. Well, they even did that. They
[01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:39.960]  went and got his address and info and posted it on his comments, calling for violence and they
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:46.040]  raided him. That's the type of stuff they do. I want to get into that. Probably just need to get
[01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:53.400]  that fell on the show. There's more news articles about cops beating people up in wheelchairs
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:15:02.040]  because they won't stand up and follow the orders. But I wanted to get into this CNN piece.
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:08.360]  I promised to spend all of Saturday and Sunday with my family, so that's why I didn't do the
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:13.880]  Sunday show. So I couldn't wait Friday night up here at the office until 10-11 at night when
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:19.160]  Anderson Cooper had already had a show to be able to comment on it. So I commented on it
[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:27.080]  beforehand. About 230 CNN called here 30 minutes towards the end of the show
[01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:30.920]  and said, and I talked to them during the break,
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:37.560]  and they said, we're doing a piece tonight about you and are you causing the violence?
[01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:42.760]  And you notice they had these raids over the weekend. They had provocateurs calling in last
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:47.160]  week and they've had news articles everywhere saying I'm causing the violence and claiming
[01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:52.360]  I'm calling for violence, just lying. And they were giggling and laughing and it was,
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:57.080]  it's just so much fun to do what they do because I'm not a human. I'm like some object out there
[01:15:57.080 --> 01:16:03.160]  they disagree with. And so Anderson Cooper has set me up for a show. I don't know. I think it's
[01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:10.520]  two or three times or more. Three times or actually more. And I've been in the car in New York,
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:14.360]  when I've been in New York a few times, driving over to their studio and they turn it back around
[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:19.240]  or I've been going down the studio and they cancel it. And I said, let me guess, this isn't
[01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:23.160]  going to be live. And they said, no, it's going to air tonight. We want to interview you at like
[01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:31.000]  four o'clock an hour after I'm off show central. So to rush downtown. And
[01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:39.240]  and I said, let me guess, you're going to interview me 15 minutes and I'm going to be in
[01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:48.120]  the program about me. It was about me for 30 seconds. And they said, they laugh and said
[01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:53.400]  exactly maximum 30 seconds. So I said, it's just to act like your journalist and look,
[01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:57.480]  here's the bad man. Here's the evil guy. But if I refuse, you're going to say I refuse to be
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:01.160]  interviewed like I had something to hide. And they laughed at that and said, basically, yes.
[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:06.200]  So I said, I'll come down there. I'll come down there. I'll go down to the TV,
[01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:11.800]  the satellite uplink place. There's three offices. I'm on international TV every week.
[01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:17.800]  And it's usually three different offices. This is the same one Carl Rove uses. I saw him on
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:21.240]  Fox this weekend in the same studio with the Capitol behind him. But
[01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:30.680]  so it wasn't seen in studios. People sent me emails saying, this is fake. You didn't,
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:35.160]  you didn't go be interviewed by CNN like it like, oh, it's the, it's the end all be all.
[01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:41.160]  And I'm lying to say I was on CNN. Oh my gosh, you know, uh, just mental illness.
[01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:46.040]  Pack, what's the name of that satellite office we were in Friday?
[01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:56.840]  Ray guy. Yeah. And then, and then one next door is Pac set. All you gum shoes just call down there.
[01:17:56.840 --> 01:18:05.800]  It was, it's called Ray Ray guy, Ray guy productions. Anyways, there's three satellite
[01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:10.280]  offices where they have satellite uplinks and they've all got windows shooting out at the Capitol.
[01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:12.120]  It's on the corner of
[01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:18.840]  10th and Congress and 11th street is right there. And there's the Capitol.
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:26.760]  In fact, I'd say 95% of the interviews got to be more than 50. I've done on mainstream TV
[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:31.240]  over the years. 90 plus percent have been there. There's some other place I've been on CNN from
[01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:34.440]  it's got a satellite uplink off of, uh,
[01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:42.520]  Oh, what's the name of the big road? B caves road.
[01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:47.560]  That's how my brain works though. I'm, I'm imaging all of this in the story
[01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:52.520]  and going over details that don't matter. We're going to come back and I'll tell you why I got
[01:18:52.520 --> 01:19:00.200]  so angry at CNN and a lot of these satellite places won't let you videotape. So I had Craig bring
[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:09.400]  a little flip camera. Craig does a great job, but the camera works a little bit shaky.
[01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:15.400]  And I says, okay, if we take this and the guys were fans, they said, sure. And we're like,
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:19.720]  darn, we should have brought a tripod and more. He said, can we jack into CNN? And I said, no,
[01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:23.640]  Craig, they're going to say no. And they said, yeah, you, they haven't agreed to your interview.
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:27.240]  So no, we're not going to, you know, we can't tape them. Plus we didn't have a jack for the little,
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:34.520]  little phone thing. So we don't have their questions to me, but I'm going to play these clips
[01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:37.880]  and go back and tell you what their questions were. And it was,
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:44.760]  it was just over and over again. Are you causing the violence? Are you causing the violence?
[01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:51.800]  They probably asked that seven, eight times. And then a couple other questions. So we'll
[01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:56.920]  play this and I'll tell you why I got so angry with CNN straight ahead. We're live at prison
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:20:04.680]  planet dot TV. We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name

[01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:05.880]  Originally we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency to ensure purity,
[01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:10.760]  content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[01:21:10.760 --> 01:21:16.280]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost
[01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:21.400]  with time. The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private
[01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:26.760]  business creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced. This is
[01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:31.480]  not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government,
[01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:36.200]  but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value. Now foreign
[01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:41.320]  governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency. Hi this is Ted

[01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:22.280]  midnight rider. Let's let this roll for a moment. I've got to run to keep from head and I'm down
[01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:33.320]  to keep from head. I've got one more silver dollar but I'm not going to catch me. No,
[01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:45.160]  I'm not going to catch the midnight rider.
[01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:58.440]  Not all on the clothes I'm wearing and the road goes on forever. I've got one more silver
[01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:07.160]  dollar but I'm not going to catch me. All right, let's go ahead and get into this CNN piece.
[01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:16.280]  So I get down there. They put me in the chair and I hear people kind of giggling and laughing
[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:23.080]  in the background and they talk to me like I'm a joke. It's all real funny and they know full
[01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:28.920]  well that I speak out against violence. They know full well the system is staging these events but
[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:34.040]  they enjoy their job manipulating people. It was one of the producers for Anderson Cooper,
[01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:43.720]  Joe something. We've got his name in there and he just keeps asking, so do you feel responsible
[01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:50.440]  for this? Are you calling for violence? Is this your fault? And then they ask questions like,
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:53.720]  well, some say you represent the tea party or you're a big part of the tea party.
[01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:59.000]  And I said, well, yeah, I think Newsweek got it right when they said I'm kind of the prophet of
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:03.160]  the tea party because a lot of the ideas and things I put out are represented by the tea parties
[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:07.720]  but I said it's a very diverse group. Just so you know what these answers to these questions
[01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:14.360]  mean because some of it isn't clear because you're not hearing the questions. They've got a
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:19.160]  professional camera aimed at me this way. My guy sitting in a chair on the side pretty far away
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:23.320]  because he couldn't be up on the stage. That's why it's shaky. He's zoomed in. He's about 15 feet
[01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:30.440]  away with a little flip camera and they shoot good video high def but it shakes a lot at a distance
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:33.400]  unless you're just having on a tripod. He didn't. It was in his hand.
[01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:44.200]  And this video is mega viral on the internet. A lot of people are watching it because
[01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:49.160]  everybody cowers down to the media like they're the authority. They're God and they
[01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:54.120]  even congressmen and others never lash out at the media. Never call them out for what they are
[01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:59.960]  and who they are. You got CNN promoting the police state, the drug raids, the Patriot Act,
[01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:05.000]  supporting Obama and his torture. They were some of the biggest liars promoting WMDs.
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:11.240]  They cover the left right paradigm. Fox covers the right. CNN covers the left and poses as if
[01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:17.800]  they're these bleeding heart loving people. Anderson Cooper is both an Aster and one other
[01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:23.080]  blue blood family. He's an intermarried super blue blood. He's one of the main heirs. He's admittedly
[01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:32.600]  CIA. He admitted he was CIA in college. And I mean, here's a CNN CIA criminal news network
[01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:42.760]  television show asking me if I'm violent and bad. And it's like a mental illness where we all
[01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:47.560]  nitty and go, I'm not bad. I'm not violent. I'm not racist. You know, and it puts us all on the
[01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:53.160]  defensive. We're, we're, we're not bad. Meanwhile, you've got the CIA. It came out in 2000, the
[01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:58.040]  Washington Post literally run by the CIA. That's why they try to act more balanced.
[01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:06.520]  It's more sophisticated propaganda than say cartoonish Fox. And here they are with a CIA
[01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:15.240]  run show with the host of its CIA and an Aster telling me I'm violent and I'm bad. So I got angry
[01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:24.200]  with them. And that's what happened. The video is linked up on info wars.com and prison planet.com.
[01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:27.960]  He goes to the tiles. It's been up two days now. You'll see the shot up there.
[01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:36.280]  And everybody, this is, I think the most popular clip we've ever had. I mean, the feedback is
[01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:41.960]  almost 100% positive. And really people are getting it that it's about challenging these people.
[01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:48.760]  And see, I knew that if I gave them those answers, they would probably never even air it
[01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:53.960]  because it wouldn't give them what they want me all up there saying, I promise I'm not violent.
[01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:59.480]  I promise I'm not racist. I prom. Oh, you're the authority. But because I was in their face the
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:04.200]  whole time, when I went home that night, kids went to bed, nine o'clock came around, we turned
[01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:13.080]  on Anderson Cooper and I said, it's never going to be aired. Now, because we've made a big public
[01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:17.240]  issue of it, it may, they weren't going to air that C span 9 11 symposium we put on. They said
[01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:24.360]  they were and then it took them almost two months to air it. People are like, see a C span wasn't
[01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:30.200]  even there. Alex, you just made that up. But we're going to come back long segment and play this.
[01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:34.200]  And I'm going to get into all the other big news issues because the system is launching their
[01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:40.040]  attacks. Now, this is the start of the biggest attack on the Patriot movement on freedom lovers
[01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:47.000]  world over that we've ever seen. This is it. So get ready, start getting the word out now and
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:53.320]  they're moving to shut down the web. It's all starting now. We're on the march. The empire's
[01:29:53.320 --> 01:30:03.080]  on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. They helped to create a new world order. We are
[01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:09.720]  part of a new world order. A new world order based upon collective action. Invisible empire is a
[01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:14.600]  damning indictment of the globalist through their own words and documents. The new world order really
[01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:20.280]  is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities. It means all the world under their control.
[01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:25.960]  The United Nations would take over America. The trilateral commission would control the world.
[01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:31.400]  Invisible empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:36.280]  to establish an oppressive world government. I believe first of all that we now need nothing
[01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:40.600]  short of a world constitution for the global financial system. Global governance with the
[01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:46.040]  establishment of the G20. So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else and I
[01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:52.920]  got news for you. You're everyone. Invisible empire. Secure your copy today at infowars.com

[01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:10.280]  and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be all I
[01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:15.960]  can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition.
[01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:21.240]  How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:25.880]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children
[01:32:25.880 --> 01:32:30.440]  sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:35.880]  and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply. Food is your
[01:32:35.880 --> 01:32:41.080]  ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.

[01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:33.400]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:43.480]  All right, I'm going to get back into singing in and start playing the video and audio here
[01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:48.120]  in just a moment. Then we'll stop it and I'll comment so you know what their questions were.
[01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:56.680]  I remember most of them but hearing my answers back and this will help me remember exactly
[01:33:56.680 --> 01:34:02.040]  what they were asking. But before we go any further, you can pre-order right now if you want
[01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:08.680]  to get it first. Invisible Empire, a new world order defined. It ships out on or before April 15th,
[01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:11.240]  covers the whole new world order, government drug dealing,
[01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:18.280]  all the perversion in Congress, how it's a pervert guild.
[01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:24.360]  It covers the round table groups, how the COG controls society.
[01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:29.320]  Really is a powerful film and you need to get it and also supports us.
[01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:34.200]  You know the videos wake people up and then of course there's police state for the rise of FEMA
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.120]  and I was watching the film again the other day. It comes out in the middle of April
[01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:47.720]  and I was thinking to myself, how do I describe everything that's in this? How do we make more
[01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:52.520]  trailers that give people an idea of what's covered? Southern Barbara Law Center is out
[01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:57.800]  demonizing the film camp FEMA that I consulted on and we also sell it and about how evil it is
[01:34:57.800 --> 01:35:00.920]  because they're scared of it. It proves the FEMA camps. Well, this goes even further.
[01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:09.960]  COG, FEMA camps, executive orders, riot police, infregard, clergy response teams, media brainwashing,
[01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:16.600]  how Glenn Beck and others put out propaganda to lie and say that FEMA camps don't exist.
[01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:24.200]  It's two hours, 24 minutes, 25 minutes or even longer I think with the credits.
[01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:28.760]  It's got shooter Jennings, great music in it along with some of the music the guys in the
[01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:38.120]  office made and it's a powerful film and it needs to be seen and a lot of people are talking about
[01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:43.400]  FEMA camps that laughed at us 10 years ago. Folks are looking for the truth now. This is a film
[01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:49.000]  people will want to watch. This has got the death camps. This has got the FEMA camps and
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:52.840]  how they're taking over and how they're doing it. It's got the military trying to set my guys up.
[01:35:52.840 --> 01:36:04.840]  It's nice, friendly, jovial, salt of the earth guys. Jason Douglas, Rob Duj, Jason Burmos,
[01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:09.640]  just super nice, super polite to the troops. Hey, can we interview your public relations person
[01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:15.400]  about the military's involvement here? They call the police on them and say they're terrorists
[01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:21.560]  and said you're not going to be able to fly anymore. Your life's over and laughed like they're
[01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:27.800]  not even humans. They're treating us like we're not humans, just trying to threaten to ruin
[01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:33.560]  people's lives and put them in prison as terrorists and it means nothing. It's like a truth rising.
[01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:41.400]  The video of these former police, we even learn their names, former detectives that work for Larry
[01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:47.160]  Silverstein, very dangerous guy, very creepy and they're just out front the building on city
[01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:53.080]  land with a protest permit, which is a violation of the first movement, but they went and got the
[01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:56.840]  permit and they come over and say, we're going to say you got bombs and you're going to go to
[01:36:56.840 --> 01:37:01.720]  prison as terrorists. On video, they don't even care if they know you're videoing with a camera in
[01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:05.080]  their face or saying, get that camera out of my face. I know you're not a terrorist, but we're
[01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:08.840]  going to put you in jail as one and then they call the cops and the cops do what they say.
[01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:14.360]  These are guys who look more good fellas than good fellas. These are guys that look more
[01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:19.080]  sopranos. You know, I always, before I traveled a lot to New York, I've been there a few times
[01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:23.000]  as a kid, but I always thought movies about gangsters was like over stylizing.
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:35.560]  I run the cops around here, get over here cops, that bag's a bomb, that camera's a gun. The cops
[01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:43.640]  grab the bag and the camera and you're right, it is. And I mean, and you're, and I've had that
[01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:50.760]  happen to me in New York, cops walk over and say, you're not going to videotape this P57. I'm going
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:56.680]  to arrest you. Then they ask you a question. You answer it. I told you not to talk, boy.
[01:37:57.720 --> 01:38:03.880]  It's just like right out of Nazi Germany, but it's good fellas running Nazi Germany.
[01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:11.160]  Oh, and they all pick on each other and they all live in a culture of fear.
[01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:20.040]  America is a cesspit. The scum rises to the top. You know what a cesspit is? It's a, you know,
[01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:26.440]  the first stage of sewage treatment or all the raw sewage, all the toilet paper, all the tampons,
[01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:31.400]  all the feces, all the urine, all the snot, all everything people cough up in the morning and
[01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:37.960]  all just goes into a big stinking vat. And that's in a cesspit.
[01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:44.440]  You know, the temperature of the water, not be 150 degrees because all the bacteria
[01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:47.560]  and all the life going on in there. And it's just, you know,
[01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:53.720]  and it's all at the top rotting in the sun. We're down here under it going, please no,
[01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:59.880]  we want this to stop. And they're saying you are tyrants. You are terrorist. You are bad down there.
[01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:05.640]  And the news is openly saying, yes, we are getting ready to take your pension funds for the private
[01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:12.440]  banks. It's good. And don't say you're against it or you're a terrorist. All right, I better get
[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:22.200]  to this video. I said I would. The point is order the videos, get them out to people. You need to
[01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:27.160]  see this. In fact, Duke keeps asking me to come direct the trailer with him. Tell Duke and his
[01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:32.520]  trailer. We need a longer trailer that shows them trying to set them up. I mean, this is hard core.
[01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:36.600]  I mean, just the military, the police, they just walk up and say, you're a terrorist.
[01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:40.760]  But in the case of Pittsburgh, it's like Southerners.
[01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:46.520]  But they're, it's the same, they have the same spirit even act the same like gangsters.
[01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:51.560]  Get you out of here. Instead, it's like, go away right over there.
[01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:57.880]  And they come over. No, we're not going to talk to you. Get out of here. Then they follow them in
[01:39:57.880 --> 01:40:07.720]  a car, call the police and say, they were trying to blow up the base. We're not human. I mean,
[01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:11.880]  let me tell you, the police and military have been trained to frame you. Boom. Just they're not
[01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:16.120]  even a thought. Hey, three nice guys come up. Hey, we want to talk to you. Here's our information.
[01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:21.480]  Here's our card. Then they said, call your boss. So I call, they get on the phone.
[01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:27.480]  And I'm like, yeah, no, I'm, yeah, infowars.com. Yeah. No, we're media. I have a syndicated
[01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:37.160]  radio show. We're also on channel 10 here in Austin. Yeah. We're like, no, I'm not going to talk to
[01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:48.920]  you. So, I mean, all this went on and then with database searches, they find out what hotel they
[01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:54.120]  check into an hour later and call them and say, oh, yeah, we're the rental car place. We want
[01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:57.240]  you to bring that rental car back probably so they can plant a bomb on them or something.
[01:40:57.800 --> 01:41:02.280]  And it had been all over the news. Alex Jones is team. I mean, that's the world we live in.
[01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:05.720]  And the guys are like, well, our car doesn't have bad brakes, but we'll bring it into Mara.
[01:41:05.720 --> 01:41:10.840]  And the guy goes, actually, I'm with the Pittsburgh PD terrorism investigation is going to be put on
[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:15.160]  a list for life. We know you were trying to blow up the perimeter and ran from them. And we have
[01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:22.920]  it all on tape. I called the guy up and I said, we're human beings, pal. I got his full name.
[01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:27.640]  And I said, you better not set our people up or we're going to have to pursue criminal charges.
[01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:32.200]  But see some little farmer in Iowa or something, they set up that it doesn't have a media operation
[01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:38.280]  to defend themselves. These people are so evil, man. Just nice Americans get out of a car. Hey,
[01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:43.160]  you know, the troops are here in town. We'd like to talk to your media person.
[01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:45.320]  Get out of here. We're going to call and say you're terrorist.
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:53.480]  I mean, think fundamentally how warped these people are. You don't think they aren't ready
[01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:56.600]  to run death camps. They'll just say you're terrorist. You don't think they're ready to
[01:41:56.600 --> 01:42:01.480]  take your house with the green police. All these people that will never have a job and
[01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:05.320]  are lazy video game heads. They can't wait to get their badges and guns and they're getting them.
[01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:09.640]  That we had that photo of Houston of environmental police. In fact, we ought to pull that up and
[01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:13.400]  put it up on screen. Okay. Getting back to CNN.
[01:42:19.560 --> 01:42:24.120]  The only reason I said I would do the CNN interview was because I knew we could videotape
[01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:29.160]  it, but we brought a small camera in case the people at this place that we couldn't tape.
[01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:35.240]  I was saying if they refused, we were just going to leave because there was no point
[01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:39.720]  letting CNN twist or warp or edit whatever I had said. I had to have a record of it.
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:44.920]  So we shot it with a little flip camera. They were nice. Let us do it. That's fine,
[01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:47.560]  but we couldn't jack in. They wouldn't let us do that.
[01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:55.320]  And then CNN, it was real funny trying to put me on the defensive like we're causing violence
[01:42:55.320 --> 01:42:59.720]  when we're covering our corruption. So I threw it back in their face and you can't hear their
[01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:05.880]  questions because again, they were on a satellite feed hooked up to the big expensive camera that
[01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:13.000]  the satellite plays on. And I was there being asked the questions, but it's the content of
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:20.200]  the information that's powerful and really has captured people's imagination to understand that
[01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:26.120]  they don't control reality anymore. They're not the gods up on a,
[01:43:28.760 --> 01:43:33.400]  I'll tell you one of the big frauds of TV. CNN's top shows have like a million viewers.
[01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:36.680]  There are lesser shows, 200, 300,000. Some of their shows like 50,000.
[01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:43.800]  And they charge tens of thousands of dollars, 50, 60, 70, a hundred thousand dollars in some cases
[01:43:43.800 --> 01:43:50.840]  for a minute ad. Meanwhile, this radio show has way more listeners than CNN. It's, but when people
[01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:56.600]  watch it, it's, oh, it's Godlike. It's so big. It's like coast to coast AM has 16 million listeners
[01:43:56.600 --> 01:44:02.840]  a night, about 3 million, 4 million listeners an hour. And there may be what one one hundredth
[01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:10.200]  of the cost of CNN. Rush Limbaugh has over 10 million listeners a day, over 22 million a week,
[01:44:10.200 --> 01:44:19.080]  total that tune in. And he's, I don't know, $3,000 a minute ad.
[01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:26.520]  CNN's 50, a hundred thousand. It's a total fraud. I mean, what's worth more? 10 million
[01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:33.480]  listeners or 200,000, 300,000, maybe 400,000, depending on the night with Anderson Cooper.
[01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:36.600]  In fact, pull up Anderson Cooper's ratings. Most nights it'll pull up a rating service.
[01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:43.000]  I usually it's 300,000. I mean, some nights 500,000. This is pathetic. But they're all
[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:47.080]  think they're God and think they're so big and think everybody has to bow down to them.
[01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:50.920]  No, I just went in there knowing what they were going to ask to throw it to them.
[01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:53.720]  So they understood that we see through them. We see them.
[01:44:57.320 --> 01:45:01.080]  And let me tell you, the attacks on us really intensified after we put this up Saturday.
[01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:10.280]  Let's go ahead and start the tape. Go ahead. You're my friend from CNN. Hi, Joe. Oh, hit pause.
[01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:18.280]  Yeah. They're like, hi, Alex. Hi. Oh, you look nice. How you doing, buddy? And I went, oh,
[01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:25.240]  you're my friend, Joe. And he changed his tone. And he goes, no, I'm not your friend.
[01:45:25.240 --> 01:45:31.800]  He was like, hi. And I was like, oh, you're my friend. And he understood that I knew it was
[01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:36.440]  cynical and sarcastic. And I was his quarry and he was the wolf and I was supposed to be the rabbit.
[01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:42.840]  And so I went, oh, you're my friend. He goes, no, I'm not your friend. I'm black ops. He didn't
[01:45:42.840 --> 01:45:48.120]  say that last part. He said, I'm not your friend. I did awful manipulating people. I'm on a power
[01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:56.360]  trip. I sold my soul. I'm here to divide the country. That's what he said in his spirit. But
[01:45:56.360 --> 01:46:03.800]  his voice said, no, I'm not your friend. I'm not your friend, Jones. He literally was like,
[01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:07.560]  oh, hi, Alex. And no, I'm not your friend. Not your friend.
[01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:20.040]  And let's go back to it. Hello, info warriors on the 26th day of March 2010. CNN called me
[01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:25.880]  and they said, we want you to come in and do an interview and tell us if it's your fault that
[01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:31.640]  all this violence is happening against supposed congressmen and others in the government and
[01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:36.120]  the aftermath of Obamacare. And I said, let me guess, you're going to interview me for 10 or
[01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:41.080]  15 minutes and then put 30 seconds of it on the news. And they laughed and said, that's exactly
[01:46:41.080 --> 01:46:45.320]  what we're going to do. And I said, fine, I'll come in because if I refuse,
[01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:52.600]  you're going to say that I wouldn't come to the interview. Alex Jones refused to be interviewed
[01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:57.880]  for this piece. So I said, I'd come in. But why did I lose? I should have told you guys, go ahead
[01:46:57.880 --> 01:47:02.760]  and skip ahead now because I've already introduced all this. And we put on screen because this was
[01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:07.080]  done Friday, but Aaron finished it Saturday that indeed they didn't air it. So let's go ahead
[01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:15.480]  and skip ahead. Here we go. Well, we have the large central banks in Bloomberg calling for taking
[01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:20.840]  the population's pension funds and 401ks and investing it to pop up the derivatives bubble.
[01:47:20.840 --> 01:47:26.520]  That's what's generating the anger. I am personally angry. And so is the American people. I mean,
[01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:33.240]  98% many polls were against the banker bailout of 2008. So the corrupt system is stirring up anger.
[01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:40.520]  That's like saying, are you angry at Hitler in 1939 Germany because you're an angry person? No,
[01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:47.000]  I'm angry at Hitler because Hitler was bad. And so the system is manifestly corrupt, looting
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:50.600]  and robbing the people. They're ignoring the will of the American people. They're violating the
[01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:56.600]  Bill of Rights and Constitution. And so anyone who is a constitutionalist is upset, just like our
[01:47:56.600 --> 01:48:02.120]  founding fathers were upset. And so, you know, our military marches often kills a million people
[01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:07.880]  in Iraq. And that's supposedly a good thing. And then Americans raise their voices and the media
[01:48:07.880 --> 01:48:11.720]  acts like it's the end of the world. What's happening here is the mainstream media doesn't
[01:48:11.720 --> 01:48:16.520]  control perception anymore. They don't control reality. They're not up on the mountain telling
[01:48:16.520 --> 01:48:22.920]  us what we can and can't do. And so there's this attempt to demonization of the Tea Party movement
[01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:27.640]  and anybody who's criticizing the government, trying to tie them to a few radicals that are out
[01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:31.240]  there. And it's just not going to work. The American people see through this, but not just
[01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:35.640]  the American people, the people of Iceland, the people of Greece, the people all over the world
[01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:39.720]  who were tired of being robbed by the IMF and the World Bank and the private fellow reserve.
[01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:45.400]  And so I am angry. I am angry. And so is the population. And we're rightfully angry. I have
[01:48:45.400 --> 01:48:50.120]  a lot of the same concerns as the, quote, Tea Party movement. But the Tea Party movement itself
[01:48:50.120 --> 01:48:54.520]  is very, very diverse. There's libertarians. There's classical liberals. There's conservatives.
[01:48:55.160 --> 01:48:58.760]  There's a lot of people that make up what you call the Tea Party movement. Then you have
[01:48:58.760 --> 01:49:03.480]  the attempt by the Republican Party to try to take over the Tea Party movement. So really,
[01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:09.080]  the Tea Party movement's a very, very diverse group. Well, let's be clear. I'm not like CNN
[01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:14.600]  and Fox promoting imaginary made up WMDs in Iraq so that our military could go kill a million
[01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:19.240]  innocent Iraqis. So no, I don't advocate for violence like the New York Times and CNN. I want
[01:49:19.240 --> 01:49:24.280]  to make that clear. I do believe in working through the courts, but also through the states
[01:49:24.280 --> 01:49:30.760]  to have them nullify these federal laws on highways and on schools and on every issue
[01:49:30.760 --> 01:49:34.600]  and on medical issues. The federal government more and more is taking over the states. So I
[01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:40.280]  advocate the ninth and 10th amendment powers of the state nullifying these unconstitutional
[01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:45.880]  federal laws and I support getting rid of the 17th amendment and bringing our senators back
[01:49:45.880 --> 01:49:49.080]  to the state level so they're controlled by the elected legislature.
[01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:59.160]  I don't advocate shock and all like CNN did. Okay. I don't have the blood of a million dead
[01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:03.000]  people on my hands. I'm not a fake liberal who poses like they're against war. That's your question.
[01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:08.440]  I didn't kill a million Iraqis like those of you at CNN who push the lies. I'm not a murderer.
[01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:14.280]  I think the rhetoric of the mainstream media lying about WMDs has caused a lot of the loss
[01:50:14.280 --> 01:50:19.560]  of trust. I think that the banker bailout they claimed the 784 billion was to unfreeze mortgages
[01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:23.160]  and the next day they said, we're not going to tell you where the money's going. We're not spending
[01:50:23.160 --> 01:50:28.120]  on that. I think that's what's to blame for the rhetoric. I also know that most we're going to
[01:50:28.120 --> 01:50:34.680]  come back and continue with it. Yeah, he's asking, are you causing the violence? Do you feel responsible?
[01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:38.840]  Do you feel like you're part of the tea party? What do you think of the tea party?
[01:50:39.560 --> 01:50:44.040]  Then he comes back with, are you causing the violence? Do you feel responsible for angering
[01:50:44.040 --> 01:50:51.320]  people the broken record? And so it gets a little more heated coming up. Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:50:51.320 --> 01:50:56.680]  again, this was shot off of a flip phone about 15 feet away as well. You hear some of that echo
[01:50:57.320 --> 01:50:59.320]  will be right back. Stay with us.

[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:07.560]  that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic
[01:52:07.560 --> 01:52:11.960]  Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than
[01:52:11.960 --> 01:52:16.360]  silver or gold? It's true, seeds that all perform even gold and silver before in this country,
[01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:21.080]  and it's possible that could even happen again. So our friends at Solutions from Science have put
[01:52:21.080 --> 01:52:27.400]  together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce

[01:54:02.760 --> 01:54:07.560]  All right, we looked it up. The average CNN show has about 250,000 viewers. Anderson Cooper,
[01:54:07.560 --> 01:54:13.320]  now that he does stunts like swimming with great white sharks, some days has 900,000 viewers.
[01:54:13.320 --> 01:54:20.360]  The point is they're legends in their own minds. And he is an Aster and what's the other family?
[01:54:20.360 --> 01:54:28.600]  Ann Vanderbilt. And so is Tucker Carlson. And you've got Lord Rothschild's son, David Rothschild's
[01:54:28.600 --> 01:54:33.240]  now a TV star. And that's what the elites do for their kids is we're taught how to worship them and
[01:54:33.240 --> 01:54:39.560]  they go join the intelligence services and become TV hosts lying to everyone. Just disgusting.
[01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:43.880]  They have these spiders trying to target me. And the other question is about why do congressmen
[01:54:43.880 --> 01:54:48.760]  get interviewed by you? And they tried to go tell congressmen, you know, why are you going on
[01:54:48.760 --> 01:54:56.040]  Alex's show as a way to divide everybody and say, that's too radical. They don't want these ideas
[01:54:56.040 --> 01:55:01.000]  going mainstream. They're trying to dictate reality. Let's continue. And the next day,
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.960]  they said, we're not going to tell you where the money's going. We're not spending on that.
[01:55:03.960 --> 01:55:08.840]  I think that's what's to blame for the rhetoric. And I also know that most of these threats on
[01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:13.640]  congressmen and attacks on offices are staged. Here's the Denver Post from 08,
[01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:19.960]  Obama workers arrested attacking their own facility in a staged event to get sympathy.
[01:55:19.960 --> 01:55:25.480]  So I also think the mainstream media promoting the few attacks that have happened and hyping it
[01:55:25.480 --> 01:55:31.160]  are going to cause mentally ill loan nuts to engage in more. And that's why the congressman
[01:55:31.160 --> 01:55:36.520]  who's reportedly got his office shot up is now telling the media to stop hyping this. But the
[01:55:36.520 --> 01:55:41.480]  media knows exactly what it's doing. It's hoping a bunch of loan nuts here and you talk about this
[01:55:41.480 --> 01:55:46.760]  24 seven go out and commit more acts so that you could try to discredit the American people that
[01:55:46.760 --> 01:55:52.920]  are exposing the unconstitutional out of control tyranny going on in Congress. But no, I think
[01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:57.800]  most of it's staged just like all the campuses where they get caught painting fake swastikas up.
[01:55:58.600 --> 01:56:02.680]  This is all political warfare to demonize opposition to big government and tyranny.
[01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:07.800]  No, but that's a loaded question. It's like, well, let me ask CNN, have you ever advocated
[01:56:07.800 --> 01:56:12.360]  violence? And yes, we know you have. I have said that if they're loading people on FEMA trucks to
[01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:17.160]  take us to death camps, and they have legislation in Congress to allow the arrest of US citizens,
[01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:21.560]  the belligerent act, that Americans have a right to defend themselves just like Germans have a
[01:56:21.560 --> 01:56:27.560]  right to defend themselves from Hitler. But I am against offensive action because we're winning
[01:56:27.560 --> 01:56:33.080]  peaceably and politically. The country is waking up. I have always spoken out against violence.
[01:56:33.080 --> 01:56:38.040]  And the last three months, I have predicted that the establishment would stage fake attacks
[01:56:38.040 --> 01:56:43.240]  against itself as a pretext to demonize their opposition. You guys can't change the subject
[01:56:43.240 --> 01:56:47.960]  off of this health care bill and the fact that it doesn't cover children with preexisting conditions
[01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:52.920]  that members of Congress and of the executive branch have been selectively made to not be
[01:56:52.920 --> 01:56:58.600]  part of the program and to be exempt, or the fact that it cuts Medicare and Medicaid and that the
[01:56:58.600 --> 01:57:03.320]  insurance companies wrote the bill. That's the big dirty secret, is the insurance companies
[01:57:03.320 --> 01:57:07.800]  actually wrote much of this bill. And that's why there's stocks way up right now. And they are
[01:57:07.800 --> 01:57:14.040]  the ones that advocate the political violence, the tasering, the naked body scanners, the pushing
[01:57:14.040 --> 01:57:19.000]  the American people trying to break our will and turn us into slaves like the people of
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:23.960]  Communist Russia or Nazi Germany. And so it's the system squeezing and squeezing and squeezing
[01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:28.920]  the American people that is pushing some of the American people into acts of desperation. But
[01:57:28.920 --> 01:57:33.800]  I tell those people watching, do not do that. Be like Mahatma Gandhi, be the change you want to
[01:57:33.800 --> 01:57:39.400]  see in the world. Be nonviolent like Martin Luther King and we are going to overturn the despotic
[01:57:39.400 --> 01:57:44.680]  system that is in this country. We are going to take it back no matter how many stage terror attacks
[01:57:44.680 --> 01:57:49.960]  the government carries out like Oklahoma City in 9-11. You will never stop the truth and you
[01:57:49.960 --> 01:57:58.200]  cannot stop the truth. It is out there and ideas are bulletproof. Myself or Ron Paul. I mean,
[01:57:58.200 --> 01:58:02.200]  I think the New York Times and Newsweek and several other publications got it right when they said
[01:58:02.200 --> 01:58:07.880]  that I am basically the prophet of the Tea Party movement. And that's because my ideas of the
[01:58:07.880 --> 01:58:14.200]  Constitution influenced the largest spectrum of people represented by the Tea Party. But it goes
[01:58:14.200 --> 01:58:20.680]  much deeper than that. So, yes, I think that I am a good person to interview, but other people
[01:58:20.680 --> 01:58:25.000]  are important to interview as well to find out what we really think, what we are really saying.
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:29.560]  The problem is the media puts it all in little sound bites. I want stability. I want to fix
[01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:35.080]  this country. I want to get the out of control corporate behavior back in check. But it's not
[01:58:35.080 --> 01:58:39.480]  going to happen because these arrogant, hubris filled politicians and the force are 100.
[01:58:42.360 --> 01:58:47.880]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:58:50.760 --> 01:58:56.200]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:58:57.400 --> 01:59:02.520]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:59:02.520 --> 01:59:09.320]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:59:11.240 --> 01:59:17.720]  They so pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:59:19.560 --> 01:59:27.240]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most. Blue diamond gussets got it,
[01:59:27.240 --> 01:59:34.520]  others don't. We turned jeans inside out. Diamond gusset jeans made in the USA with
[01:59:34.520 --> 01:59:40.440]  unparalleled quality. Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection,
[01:59:40.440 --> 01:59:47.880]  so you could ride all day with confidence. Order yours at gusset.com. Diamond gusset jeans got it,
[01:59:47.880 --> 01:59:57.160]  others don't. Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the
[01:59:57.160 --> 01:59:58.680]  GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.400 --> 02:00:12.680]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.400 --> 02:00:21.640]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.640 --> 02:00:27.720]  We have now reached the halfway point in the syndicated radio transmission.
[02:00:28.600 --> 02:00:33.160]  Thank you for joining us. We are SimulCasting at PrismPlanet.tv.
[02:00:33.160 --> 02:00:39.000]  Okay, I'm going to finish up with a seeing an event that happened Friday. See, they're not
[02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:46.040]  God anymore. Before they could just do that 50-minute interview, never release it or take
[02:00:46.040 --> 02:00:53.480]  sound bites out of context. But I'll guarantee you, this video has gone so viral, 100,000 views
[02:00:53.480 --> 02:00:58.760]  just on one channel, with the two videos, just in the last, or more than 100,000,
[02:00:58.760 --> 02:01:05.000]  just in the last day and a half, that a month from now, it'll be over a million. So this video
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:11.240]  will be seen more than Anderson Cooper's show was that night. And that's what scares the system.
[02:01:11.240 --> 02:01:17.320]  I can make a film like The Obama Deception over 50 million views for free. You can buy the DVD and
[02:01:17.320 --> 02:01:21.640]  support us if you want. The point is, or see it in higher quality at PrismPlanet.tv,
[02:01:22.760 --> 02:01:28.680]  the point here is they don't control reality. And we're here challenging them. Again, I'm going to
[02:01:28.680 --> 02:01:37.000]  get into all the other news. I haven't even really started getting into it. It's amazing,
[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:43.000]  the subway bombings, the lady exposed in the CPS, Senator from Georgia being murdered with her husband.
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:52.440]  All these militia arrests, the demonization saying we're going to attack the Tea Party's or
[02:01:52.440 --> 02:01:57.240]  terrorist. I mean, they're really getting ready. And I told you this would come in March and April.
[02:01:57.240 --> 02:02:02.200]  Here we are. I could see all their preconditioning. I know when they start the conditioning, how long
[02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:07.640]  it's going to be generally. And here I am saying big terror attacks are a whole bunch of small ones
[02:02:07.640 --> 02:02:14.920]  coming up in April. They're going to blame on us. They blame cop killings on me. CNN's trying to
[02:02:14.920 --> 02:02:22.200]  produce pieces on me right now about Alex Jones. I don't know they were planning to arrest me this
[02:02:22.200 --> 02:02:27.560]  weekend or something. We've had some other stuff going on. Set me up or something. We're not sure,
[02:02:27.560 --> 02:02:34.040]  but just pray for us, folks. But this means I'm getting the job done that they're coming after
[02:02:34.040 --> 02:02:38.840]  me like this. There's a little bit of this clip left of part one and we'll come back and put the
[02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:43.560]  last five minutes, part two, and then I'm going to shift gears into other news. I'm going to give
[02:02:43.560 --> 02:02:48.600]  the phone number out on any of the issues that you wish to discuss. I mean, I hope it's on the
[02:02:48.600 --> 02:02:56.040]  militia arrest. I hope it's on this poor woman being murdered, Ms. Schaefer. I hope it's on the
[02:02:56.040 --> 02:03:04.040]  suicide bombing. All this police state news I've got is insane. Tucker Carlson going on the daily
[02:03:04.040 --> 02:03:08.520]  show saying people that think Jews did 9-11 like Jesse Ventura. See, the feds run the white
[02:03:08.520 --> 02:03:13.320]  supremacist and they always parrot that and attack anybody that doesn't exclusively cover that
[02:03:14.120 --> 02:03:17.560]  because they believe that's politically unpalatable and so that will demonize and
[02:03:17.560 --> 02:03:22.040]  shut down 9-11 truth. It's not going to work, but Ventura has said he doesn't know who did 9-11,
[02:03:22.040 --> 02:03:27.320]  but those buildings were surely blown up. And though that they're now, I mean, he could definitely
[02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:33.560]  sue Tucker Carlson saying Jesse Ventura says Jews did it. So that's coming up. And again,
[02:03:33.560 --> 02:03:37.720]  notice it's always the media making the Jew jokes. The media always putting out Jew, Jew,
[02:03:37.720 --> 02:03:42.280]  Jew, Jew, Jew, especially on Comedy Central. They know what they're doing. Let's go ahead and finish
[02:03:42.280 --> 02:03:47.640]  the clip as well to find out what we really think, what we're really saying. The problem is the media
[02:03:47.640 --> 02:03:52.680]  puts it all a little sound bites. I want stability. I want to fix this country. I want to get the out
[02:03:52.680 --> 02:03:58.280]  of control corporate behavior back in check, but it's not going to happen because these arrogant,
[02:03:58.280 --> 02:04:04.680]  hubris filled politicians and the Fortune 100 know how to manipulate the population and believe
[02:04:04.680 --> 02:04:09.720]  they're in total control and now they've committed everything to this banking,
[02:04:09.720 --> 02:04:20.040]  world government takeover. And so we're in an emergency situation here. All right, continued
[02:04:20.040 --> 02:04:23.080]  in part two. There's about five and a half minutes left. We're going to come back. I'm going to try
[02:04:23.080 --> 02:04:27.080]  to just play it one swath comment after and then plunged into the news.
[02:04:30.440 --> 02:04:36.040]  Again, the websites are info wars.com info wars.net, prisonplanet.tv, Jones report.com
[02:04:36.040 --> 02:04:42.120]  April 15th and April 21st. We're premiering two films at prisonplanet.tv in the month of April.
[02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:45.560]  We're simulcasting live at prisonplanet.tv right now for viewers. I want to thank
[02:04:46.120 --> 02:04:49.720]  all the members out there that really supports us. Plus, it's a great place to download all the
[02:04:49.720 --> 02:04:53.560]  documentaries and higher quality and the TV shows and share them with friends and family.
[02:04:54.440 --> 02:04:56.920]  It's all about the info war. Ladies and gentlemen, stay with us.
[02:04:56.920 --> 02:05:05.960]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:05:05.960 --> 02:05:10.680]  This is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:05:11.480 --> 02:05:14.360]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:05:14.360 --> 02:05:18.440]  They have tremendous influence on our president and Congress,
[02:05:18.440 --> 02:05:23.160]  and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:05:23.160 --> 02:05:28.840]  as American citizens to pay attention. Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation,
[02:05:28.840 --> 02:05:34.200]  the criminal offshore cartel, hell bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes
[02:05:34.200 --> 02:05:38.040]  constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and arsonists,
[02:05:38.040 --> 02:05:42.040]  they're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[02:05:42.040 --> 02:05:48.440]  Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington DC, we have seen a fall of the
[02:05:48.440 --> 02:05:56.040]  Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right now
[02:05:56.040 --> 02:05:59.240]  in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:06:02.360 --> 02:06:06.360]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:06.360 --> 02:06:11.320]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into
[02:06:11.320 --> 02:06:16.760]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs. The respiratory system is the first
[02:06:16.760 --> 02:06:21.960]  line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses. The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the
[02:06:21.960 --> 02:06:27.800]  respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the
[02:06:27.800 --> 02:06:33.640]  silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream. With continued legislation threatening the sale
[02:06:33.640 --> 02:06:39.480]  of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver
[02:06:39.480 --> 02:06:45.000]  Lungs Generator. Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production
[02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:52.120]  fast and simple. Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology
[02:06:52.120 --> 02:06:56.520]  of the Silver Lungs Generator. That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:07:00.360 --> 02:07:04.600]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[02:07:04.600 --> 02:07:09.080]  seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[02:07:09.080 --> 02:07:13.240]  non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds about
[02:07:13.240 --> 02:07:17.800]  perform even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:07:17.800 --> 02:07:23.080]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:07:23.080 --> 02:07:29.000]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food
[02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:32.760]  for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically
[02:07:32.760 --> 02:07:38.520]  modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden. So visit
[02:07:38.520 --> 02:07:47.960]  them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:07:47.960 --> 02:07:57.000]  That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.560]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:07:59.560 --> 02:08:07.320]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:09.880 --> 02:08:15.960]  Militias have been rated in five states now. Alabama added to the list. That's coming up.
[02:08:19.560 --> 02:08:23.880]  Remember, suppose that Alabama militia called for throwing rocks through windows. I wonder if the
[02:08:23.880 --> 02:08:28.120]  leader that called for all this is going to go to jail, or will it be found out that he's a federal
[02:08:28.120 --> 02:08:37.960]  informant, like Hal Turner, or like Tom McVeigh, Tim McVeigh. Will it come out of CIA, like Lee
[02:08:37.960 --> 02:08:47.400]  Harvey Oswald? That's now been declassified. We're going to cover all this. Tis is the season.
[02:08:47.960 --> 02:08:52.280]  They're passing all these unconstitutional, unpopular, illegal things. They're going to
[02:08:52.280 --> 02:08:56.600]  stage events and provocateur events turning around against us, and the media is going to blame
[02:08:56.600 --> 02:09:04.840]  yours truly. They're number one enemy now. Pray for us, but it's because we're effective that
[02:09:04.840 --> 02:09:11.000]  this is happening. This is a blessing, actually. All right. Here I am being interviewed by the
[02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:17.480]  producers. They're asking questions. Again, if you just joined us, there's no audio for
[02:09:17.480 --> 02:09:23.720]  those. We shot this with a flip phone in the studio. I'm in Austin. They're in New York,
[02:09:23.720 --> 02:09:27.800]  Anderson Cooper, and they just keep saying, are you causing the violence? Are you causing the
[02:09:27.800 --> 02:09:31.960]  violence? And I mean, think about it. You got CNN, who was the biggest group along with Fox,
[02:09:31.960 --> 02:09:36.920]  pushing WMDs in Iraq, and they knew it wasn't true. It's come out to Pentagon and CIA literally
[02:09:36.920 --> 02:09:41.400]  runs CNN. They just poses liberals to cover up what they're doing. It's left, right manipulation,
[02:09:42.280 --> 02:09:48.280]  and it's angry to me to have these people that go to their cocktail parties and feel like they're
[02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:54.200]  great liberals when they're really a bunch of propagandists helping to destroy our country and
[02:09:54.200 --> 02:09:57.880]  pushing the banker bailout takeover and the carbon taxes. I mean, these are really
[02:09:57.880 --> 02:10:02.440]  despicable people. I'm angry at them. They're destroying my country. They're taking my freedom.
[02:10:02.440 --> 02:10:06.760]  They're aiding and abetting the corporations that own them. And it makes me angry
[02:10:10.520 --> 02:10:16.280]  that they're there trying to imply I'm bad and I'm evil. And they're going along with this
[02:10:16.280 --> 02:10:22.520]  talking point that I'm basically a terrorist. Here it is. Oh, absolutely. Disgusting your
[02:10:22.520 --> 02:10:26.760]  government. Hating back up. As soon as I heard that, I remember this question. They said,
[02:10:26.760 --> 02:10:29.400]  there's a new term called hatreds.
[02:10:33.080 --> 02:10:37.560]  What do you think of the term hatred center? Are you a hatred? And here is my response.
[02:10:38.360 --> 02:10:45.000]  Oh, absolutely. Distrusting your government, hating despotism and corruption is as
[02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:49.880]  American as apple pie. I mean, if you read George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin,
[02:10:49.880 --> 02:10:55.560]  I absolutely hate it when the cops shoot a handcuffed youth in the back and then cover it up.
[02:10:55.560 --> 02:11:00.680]  I absolutely hate it when trillions of dollars are stolen in the banker bailout and then
[02:11:00.680 --> 02:11:05.800]  the Federal Reserve won't tell us where the money went. I love my country. I love my constitution.
[02:11:05.800 --> 02:11:11.400]  I love my republic. But I hate and fear the corrupt foreign corporate interests that have
[02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:17.080]  hijacked our nation and are using the government as a tool to loot and suck our country dry,
[02:11:17.080 --> 02:11:23.560]  like Argentina or Nigeria or Greece. And so absolutely. I hate Hitler. I hate Stalin. I
[02:11:23.560 --> 02:11:30.760]  hate Mao. I hate Fidel Castro. I hate Pol Pot. I hate all despots. And by any historical yardstick,
[02:11:30.760 --> 02:11:38.520]  America is sliding quickly into full bore scientific 21st century tyranny. And you better
[02:11:38.520 --> 02:11:44.840]  believe I hate seeing my country where I have three children being destroyed and bankrupted by design
[02:11:44.840 --> 02:11:49.240]  and watching Herman von Rupey, the head of the EU and Ban Ki-moon, the head of the UN.
[02:11:49.240 --> 02:11:54.360]  And Gordon Brown, the prime minister of England, all say global government is here run by banks
[02:11:54.360 --> 02:11:59.400]  and they're going to levy carbon taxes on it. And then mainstream news runs pieces saying we're
[02:11:59.400 --> 02:12:05.320]  crazy. World government doesn't exist. You guys still think you've got the people bamboozled and
[02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:09.880]  conned. You don't. They see the world leaders calling for world government. And then they see
[02:12:09.880 --> 02:12:15.720]  you saying it doesn't exist. And that's why you're losing all credibility. So keep pushing it because
[02:12:15.720 --> 02:12:21.720]  the American people are awake seeing in and Fox and MSNBC and all of you who who sit there on
[02:12:21.720 --> 02:12:26.200]  the perches of the false left right paradigm with this false debate going on where you try to
[02:12:26.200 --> 02:12:31.640]  sucker people in to your false reality. It's over. The people are awake. And the new world order
[02:12:31.640 --> 02:12:36.120]  needs to back off and realize they should cut their losses now because the awakening is on.
[02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:43.720]  What I said was Denver Post, we know Democrats have staged attacks on facility.
[02:12:44.280 --> 02:12:47.880]  Back that up a few seconds. So that question makes sense for people.
[02:12:53.160 --> 02:13:00.600]  Then the interviewer says, oh, so you think this is all fake. You think this is all stage. And I
[02:13:00.600 --> 02:13:06.280]  said, no, the Denver Post reported. Remember last Friday, I showed you the Denver Post AP a bunch
[02:13:06.280 --> 02:13:11.880]  of other articles where Democrats have staged attacks on their own offices all over the country.
[02:13:12.760 --> 02:13:20.120]  That was just one example. And so again, they were trying to ignore the fact that I was showing
[02:13:20.120 --> 02:13:25.800]  them a mainstream admission and arrested have been made. And they were trying to basically
[02:13:25.800 --> 02:13:31.240]  change the subject. Continue ordering stuff back off and realize they should cut their losses now
[02:13:31.240 --> 02:13:39.320]  because the awakening is on. What I said was Denver Post, we know Democrats have staged attacks
[02:13:39.320 --> 02:13:44.760]  on their own facilities as part of a frame up before. And I believe a lot of this is exaggerated
[02:13:44.760 --> 02:13:49.480]  and hasn't happened. Sure, 300 million people in the nation, a lot of them angry. You better
[02:13:49.480 --> 02:13:54.280]  believe some real things may happen. But I know nine times out of the 10 when I've studied these
[02:13:54.280 --> 02:14:01.240]  things, it's been admitted that it was a staged event. So again, my rhetoric is the truth and
[02:14:01.240 --> 02:14:07.960]  is waking people up. Justice be done, may the heavens fall. Okay, that's like criticizing people
[02:14:07.960 --> 02:14:11.960]  in Germany that were criticizing Hitler, saying, are you causing the brown shirts to go out and
[02:14:11.960 --> 02:14:16.920]  beat people up? There's a lot more government violence and IRS thugs coming with guns to take
[02:14:16.920 --> 02:14:21.400]  people's houses than there are people throwing bricks through windows. And most of that's probably
[02:14:21.400 --> 02:14:27.320]  staged. While I was told by some of your producers that this piece is also about, you know, why are
[02:14:28.040 --> 02:14:32.200]  our congressmen coming on my show? I mean, they can go on anybody's show they want. They don't
[02:14:32.200 --> 02:14:37.240]  have to agree with me or disagree to be able to come on my radio show. What I've seen the mainstream
[02:14:37.240 --> 02:14:45.880]  media, the dying dinosaur media do is attempt to condition the public that it's not acceptable for
[02:14:45.880 --> 02:14:50.360]  different political groups and organizations to associate with each other. And that's another
[02:14:50.360 --> 02:14:55.800]  attempt by the establishment control corporate media to set the parameters of debate and to
[02:14:55.800 --> 02:15:01.160]  attack congressmen who've come on my radio show. This has been done over and over and over again,
[02:15:01.160 --> 02:15:07.240]  because the establishment knows that the true populist message of freedom and liberty and
[02:15:07.240 --> 02:15:13.720]  smaller government is resonating. And so they're attempting to paint it as radical so that more
[02:15:14.280 --> 02:15:18.520]  mainline Americans don't join it. But that's already happened. The American people are in the
[02:15:18.520 --> 02:15:23.400]  process of waking up right now. And a lot of congressmen come on my radio show to promote
[02:15:23.400 --> 02:15:28.920]  different legislation they're pushing, like auditing the Fed or to tell us about, you know,
[02:15:28.920 --> 02:15:33.880]  things that are happening in Congress. And the reason we have congressmen on the show is so that
[02:15:33.880 --> 02:15:38.600]  they can give us an inside view on what's happening in the Capitol. Same reason you interview congressmen.
[02:15:38.600 --> 02:15:44.360]  Well, that's a ridiculous over semification. There are probably 15 or 20 members of the Congress
[02:15:44.360 --> 02:15:50.120]  that I do support who are constitutionalists. I'm not opposed to all government. I'm not an
[02:15:50.120 --> 02:15:57.080]  anarchist. And I've had calls back about five seconds. That question was, well, if all government's
[02:15:57.080 --> 02:16:02.440]  bad and you're for zero government, and you hate all the congresspeople, why do you have them on
[02:16:02.440 --> 02:16:09.480]  your show? Now, this is sophomoric. This is fifth grade level. But it's designed for the
[02:16:09.480 --> 02:16:15.880]  dumb down public that still gets their news from CNN. And I said, that's ridiculous.
[02:16:17.080 --> 02:16:21.400]  There are 15 or more people that are good in Congress, but I would interview people I disagree
[02:16:21.400 --> 02:16:28.920]  with as well. See, it's this idea that congressmen are coming on the alternative media because they
[02:16:28.920 --> 02:16:34.600]  told me Ron Paul refused to be on this show. Their program and so the other congressmen
[02:16:34.600 --> 02:16:41.160]  and CNN and we had Gomer on attacking for several weeks off and on on none of the week and cuck
[02:16:41.160 --> 02:16:46.600]  of the week or those different specials they have. What's it called? A wing none of the week.
[02:16:46.600 --> 02:16:52.040]  Yeah. And again, don't go on Alex's show. Don't give him credibility. Don't don't don't.
[02:16:52.680 --> 02:16:57.640]  It's the information that has the credibility. These congressmen know where the audience is.
[02:16:59.640 --> 02:17:03.480]  And it's so sophomoric when during the campaign, they asked Ron Paul, why do you go on Alex Jones
[02:17:03.480 --> 02:17:12.920]  a show on Fox CNN everywhere? They're also trying to at a primitive level,
[02:17:15.080 --> 02:17:18.520]  break us up thinking that if they don't come on my show, I'm not going to support him.
[02:17:18.520 --> 02:17:22.280]  I'd support Ron Paul. We came on the show or not. Ron Paul's been on this show
[02:17:23.640 --> 02:17:28.440]  probably close to a hundred times the last 14 years. I've been interviewing him every month
[02:17:28.440 --> 02:17:34.040]  or month and a half in the last six, seven years before that two, three times a year.
[02:17:34.040 --> 02:17:37.320]  I mean, how many times is that 60 times 70 times? I don't know.
[02:17:38.680 --> 02:17:42.840]  Interviewed him a couple times on video. I mean, it's just sophomoric mind control.
[02:17:42.840 --> 02:17:48.680]  Let's finish it up. Our constitutionalist, I'm not opposed to all government. I'm not an anarchist.
[02:17:49.240 --> 02:17:55.320]  And I've had Congressmen and women on who I disagree with. So it's ridiculous. I don't
[02:17:55.320 --> 02:18:00.600]  say they're all crooks, but the leadership by and large are bought and paid for. And many of them
[02:18:00.600 --> 02:18:04.200]  are crooks and are doing things that are illegal and unconstitutional.
[02:18:05.080 --> 02:18:08.920]  You bet, guys. Take care of yourselves. And let me just add one more thing.
[02:18:08.920 --> 02:18:12.200]  I dare you to put this on television. I want to say hi to the little blue blood
[02:18:12.200 --> 02:18:18.200]  Aster Anderson Cooper. And I want to say hi. He had been with CIA. And I want to ask Anderson,
[02:18:18.200 --> 02:18:25.960]  hey, covered by CNN and BBC reported building seven fell 25 minutes before it fell with total precision.
[02:18:25.960 --> 02:18:28.920]  Oh, you guys announced that little script a little early, didn't you?
[02:18:29.480 --> 02:18:34.280]  Oh, that little Reuters script that MI6 sent on over. Look, the truth's out there.
[02:18:34.280 --> 02:18:38.200]  And everybody needs to choose a side. Are you going to be on the side of the murdering military
[02:18:38.200 --> 02:18:41.240]  industrial complex? Or are you going to be on the side of the American people?
[02:18:41.240 --> 02:18:46.680]  If the government of this country lied to kill over a million Iraqis with fake WMDs,
[02:18:46.680 --> 02:18:52.440]  do any of us think that any of our lives mean a rat's behind to this establishment?
[02:18:52.440 --> 02:18:59.640]  This is real tyranny. We're in trouble. I'm sounding the alarm just like 1775, 1776.
[02:18:59.640 --> 02:19:04.440]  If the Red Codes come marching down the road and open fire on the American people,
[02:19:04.440 --> 02:19:09.000]  it's their right to defend themselves. But I'm not calling for any offensive actions.
[02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:13.000]  I'm calling like Malcolm X did for people to be able to protect themselves
[02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:19.320]  in this country from scum and CNN.
[02:19:21.560 --> 02:19:23.800]  Good job killing those Iraqis with your lies.
[02:19:27.880 --> 02:19:30.600]  You take care. I shouldn't laugh. It's very serious.
[02:19:32.280 --> 02:19:37.000]  But they need to be rebuked. They need to be exposed. People need to get in their face
[02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:40.040]  for all the things government and media have done, all this corruption and evil.
[02:19:40.040 --> 02:19:48.040]  I mean, this is serious, serious business. And CNN is part of it. CNN helps sell all
[02:19:48.040 --> 02:19:52.440]  this murder and all this tyranny. The blood is on their hands. They're a dangerous group
[02:19:52.440 --> 02:19:57.160]  now setting me up for a big fall. They're coming after me. You understand that?
[02:20:01.320 --> 02:20:05.400]  Fact. Four million people in the U.S. have hepatitis C due to liver damage.
[02:20:05.400 --> 02:20:10.120]  Fact. Cirrhosis of the liver is the eighth leading cause of death among Americans. Fact.
[02:20:10.120 --> 02:20:15.080]  Alcohol, mini prescription drugs, food additives, pesticides, and environmental toxins damage
[02:20:15.080 --> 02:20:20.520]  the liver. Fact. One in 10 Americans is or has been affected by liver or gallbladder disease.
[02:20:20.520 --> 02:20:25.080]  Fact. Anything that keeps the liver from doing its job can put your life in danger.

[02:21:14.760 --> 02:21:19.880]  really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities. It means all the world under
[02:21:19.880 --> 02:21:25.640]  their control. The United Nations would take over America. The Trilateral Commission would control
[02:21:25.640 --> 02:21:30.920]  the world. Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth
[02:21:30.920 --> 02:21:36.200]  for centuries to establish an oppressive world government. I believe first of all that we now
[02:21:36.200 --> 02:21:40.840]  need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system. Global governance
[02:21:40.840 --> 02:21:46.280]  with the establishment of the G20. So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else

[02:22:09.800 --> 02:22:15.880]  debt currently exceeding $12.5 trillion and our unfunded liabilities tolling over $107 trillion,

[02:23:05.160 --> 02:23:10.200]  begins in the colon? Did you know that 80% of all Americans suffer from internal parasites and
[02:23:10.200 --> 02:23:15.320]  parasitic infection? If allowed our bodies are capable of healing themselves. The key to optimal

[02:24:03.480 --> 02:24:08.520]  We are back live. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us. Okay, I'm going in the next
[02:24:08.520 --> 02:24:14.760]  segment to get into all these militia arrests, the bombing in Russia with reported suicide
[02:24:14.760 --> 02:24:19.480]  bombers. It looks like false flag is the early indicators and airmarks. The signature
[02:24:21.080 --> 02:24:29.320]  of the attack, we are also going to get into the sad murder and it should be a murder investigation.
[02:24:30.200 --> 02:24:35.800]  Former Senator Nancy Schaefer in Georgia who'd come on this show repeatedly and was tracking
[02:24:35.800 --> 02:24:42.200]  the CPS involved in kidnapping children for sale. So that is coming up.
[02:24:43.640 --> 02:24:47.720]  Towards the end of the broadcast, I'm going to play a clip that's up on PrisonPlanet.com
[02:24:48.280 --> 02:24:55.080]  of a gentleman Friday at one of the Tea Party events with Palin in Arizona. A Ron Paul supporter
[02:24:55.640 --> 02:24:59.720]  and all he reportedly did was start saying, you're not a real conservative. You're not a
[02:24:59.720 --> 02:25:04.920]  real conservative. And the Tea Partiers tackle him, slam him to the ground or jumping on his head
[02:25:04.920 --> 02:25:10.360]  and the police come over and help them. So vigilanteism. He didn't resist. They could have
[02:25:10.360 --> 02:25:17.080]  told him to leave. These are not real public events. They attack hecklers savagely. Nothing
[02:25:17.080 --> 02:25:21.800]  more evil than a Ron Paul supporter who's a real conservative and who's anti-war
[02:25:23.240 --> 02:25:27.880]  when the wars are illegal and undeclared and fraudulent. So that's coming up. And I want to
[02:25:27.880 --> 02:25:32.280]  play the clip of where George Bush had me arrested, but at least they didn't tackle me or beat me up.
[02:25:32.280 --> 02:25:36.280]  They did hurt my arm by twisting it behind my back. I didn't resist. I think they said,
[02:25:36.280 --> 02:25:39.160]  give me your hands. And I went like that and was let out. And they said, okay,
[02:25:39.160 --> 02:25:43.080]  we're throwing the book at you until they got a call and they said, get off the radio,
[02:25:43.080 --> 02:25:48.120]  get on cell. And the cop driving me said, the governor says releasing the governor,
[02:25:48.920 --> 02:25:55.800]  George W. Bush at the time was 98. And so, oh, but not for an hour. Oh, you'll call me.
[02:25:55.800 --> 02:26:03.320]  Wouldn't let him go. Okay. That was real nice by Williamson County. They dropped me off on the
[02:26:03.320 --> 02:26:09.960]  county line. Luckily, my office was near there at the time. It was up north. But I want to tell
[02:26:09.960 --> 02:26:16.520]  this story before I get into the news and then take your calls. Number one, the toll free number
[02:26:16.520 --> 02:26:25.080]  to join us is 1-800-259-9231. The information I'm about to cover is so important that I hope
[02:26:25.080 --> 02:26:31.960]  you'll pay attention to it. And I'll try to be as brief as possible, but seeing it and it really
[02:26:31.960 --> 02:26:40.280]  coming home to me, the level of matrix like control we're in. Yesterday, I took my children
[02:26:41.400 --> 02:26:47.720]  to the hike and bike trail, all three of them, toddler on my shoulders, the five and seven year
[02:26:47.720 --> 02:26:56.840]  old running in front of me. And we hiked down to one of the innumerable creeks that feed into
[02:26:56.840 --> 02:27:05.080]  Bull Creek. And I went to one of the smaller entrances that were probably only 15, maybe 20
[02:27:05.080 --> 02:27:09.800]  cars parked there. Some of the big points people go to, big entrances to all the hike and bike
[02:27:09.800 --> 02:27:14.120]  trails are not Austin. A lot of this is hilly areas, so they can't build houses. So they have
[02:27:14.120 --> 02:27:23.160]  city hike and bike trails. And it was the control freak nature and how mentally ill and weird and
[02:27:23.160 --> 02:27:27.880]  twisted the people were. And I've been going on Austin hike and bike trails since I was five years
[02:27:27.880 --> 02:27:32.360]  old. We come down here a few times a year and sitting around grandma's house, you know, for
[02:27:32.360 --> 02:27:36.200]  four or five days, we get boring. My parents sent me to hike and bike trails. And since high school,
[02:27:37.240 --> 02:27:43.320]  I mean, I used to go to these things every day. But things are changing. It's like the matrix
[02:27:43.320 --> 02:27:50.360]  mine control. Or maybe I just ran into a particularly bad pack of people. Now, you have to understand,
[02:27:50.360 --> 02:27:58.040]  this is gravel path. And they also cut up cedar trees and make like a turf. So it's,
[02:28:00.040 --> 02:28:04.920]  it's not rugged at all. There's a few places where there's, you know, stone steps carved into the
[02:28:04.920 --> 02:28:12.920]  stone. And with Parker car, we start walking and there's this old lady with her husband walking
[02:28:12.920 --> 02:28:19.960]  behind her. And she could tell she wore the pants and she goes, um, oh, it's rough down there. I
[02:28:19.960 --> 02:28:23.560]  don't know if you should take that baby. And I kind of ignored her and she said, uh, uh,
[02:28:26.200 --> 02:28:30.600]  and then so my kids ran on and I went on down the path and then I noticed she was following me
[02:28:32.520 --> 02:28:37.240]  and looking at me. I mean, and maybe she recognized me and I'm a thought criminal
[02:28:37.240 --> 02:28:45.960]  and it's like a jailhouse rat or something. And I get down there and there's one sign that says,
[02:28:45.960 --> 02:28:51.160]  please stay off, you know, please stay on the path, you know, in certain areas where they've
[02:28:51.160 --> 02:28:55.480]  planted trees or whatever. I mean, you'll see one of these signs every 200 yards or so.
[02:28:56.680 --> 02:29:00.360]  And so we get down the little creek and my kids are there dropping rocks and going,
[02:29:00.360 --> 02:29:07.240]  oh, look, you know, and look, oh, fishy. And I hadn't seen the old woman and her husband stalking me
[02:29:07.240 --> 02:29:11.560]  back there for a while because they were leaving and they turned around and came after us. And
[02:29:12.200 --> 02:29:16.200]  this lady comes by with her husband. Again, he's walking behind her. He doesn't talk. She's giving
[02:29:16.200 --> 02:29:20.200]  all the orders and it really hit me. And I know the feminist program. I know how it works, but my
[02:29:20.200 --> 02:29:24.520]  God, man, it's not all women, but it's certainly these women. We come back. I'm going to finish
[02:29:24.520 --> 02:29:31.080]  the story, folks. It gets so weird. I mean, it gets weird. And the population is all being
[02:29:31.080 --> 02:29:35.000]  dominated. They want to dominate somebody. They want to boss somebody. And I'm telling you,
[02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:41.320]  this is one big plantation. You've got house slaves everywhere. And I guess they don't like a halfway
[02:29:41.320 --> 02:29:46.040]  good looking man with, you know, great looking children. And we were all having a great time.
[02:29:46.040 --> 02:29:52.600]  And they were all real quiet. Everybody was real. We're in trouble. We're on the march.
[02:29:52.600 --> 02:29:57.960]  The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:30:01.080 --> 02:30:05.640]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle
[02:30:05.640 --> 02:30:10.840]  and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be all I
[02:30:10.840 --> 02:30:16.520]  can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition.
[02:30:16.520 --> 02:30:21.800]  How much do you want? When do you want it now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[02:30:21.800 --> 02:30:26.440]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children
[02:30:26.440 --> 02:30:31.000]  sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:35.720]  and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:30:35.720 --> 02:30:41.160]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't
[02:30:41.160 --> 02:30:46.520]  know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live

[02:31:51.000 --> 02:32:19.000]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again. So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect solution.
[02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:37.000]  Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full-acre crisis garden.
[02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:59.000]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:24.000]  Okay, so I'm about 500 yards down the Heikenbike Trail, and everyone of, like, eight, nine groups that came by me were neurotic weirdos.
[02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:37.000]  Now, my children in a little stream going into a bigger stream down a little hill are sitting there, and these kids run up, probably seven and nine, two boys, with their mother giving orders and marching around the husband behind her, being real quiet.
[02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:51.000]  And she's like, you're not allowed to get in that water. This is environmentally sensitive, and the kids are screaming, I hate you. I hate you. And you can tell she's never disciplined them, and they're doing all this weird stuff, and they're like, those kids aren't supposed to be in there.
[02:33:51.000 --> 02:34:06.000]  But like I'm not there, but you're saying it to her husband and kids, the husband's not talking. They go on down the path, and you can go down some gravel to a larger stream, and my two bigger kids go down there.
[02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:22.000]  I'm up there with the toddler playing in the stream. No, oh, look, leaf down the stream. And then I look back over my shoulder, and that old woman's walking up looking at me and going, um, and walks pine or husband's going, the old man's going like that.
[02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:32.000]  Like, um, and I'm thinking, no, don't be paranoid. This can't be happening. And then the other family comes back, and the wife's going, they're not supposed to be down there. They're not supposed to be in there. No boys.
[02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:38.000]  And the guy pulls out his iPhone and starts taking pictures of me and my kids, and it's sitting there going.
[02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:47.000]  And they've got these. What's the thing we showed? It's a big website the government promotes where you've tattle on environmental crimes. New website allows you to tattle tail. And it's not even things that are crimes.
[02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:56.000]  It's leaving lights on in businesses. Remember, we showed that about two months ago. And I don't know what he was taking. And I'm not going to have a conversation. I know the creek goes on down.
[02:34:56.000 --> 02:35:11.000]  So I get my kids and I go further down into the woods or somebody around here. I can be here on the side of the path and let my kids sit there by the stream. And which is everybody does except this body snatcher day.
[02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:15.000]  They weren't there's no rule against it.
[02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:23.000]  And here comes the old lady again. She's following me and then she'll walk past and she's off in the woods looking at me and they're talking.
[02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:35.000]  And then some more yuppies come by with their kids and I try to talk to them. You know, they stopped right beside me and I'm like, oh, look, you know, pretty streams, a lot of rain this year.
[02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:40.000]  They're like, are you allowed to be in the stream?
[02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:44.000]  And now it's really getting weird.
[02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:57.000]  And I didn't talk about it, but about a month and a half ago I was at the Porter Renz's jetty. And it's concrete paved about half the way out. I mean, it's like walking down a sidewalk.
[02:35:57.000 --> 02:36:05.000]  And it's my mom, my dad, my wife and my three children. And I've got the toddler on my shoulders except when she wants to walk, we'll let her down.
[02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:15.000]  And it's a still beautiful day. Pelicans are fishing, you know, catching fish and it's just so beautiful and we're out there. People keep walking by going, is it safe to have that child out here?
[02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:22.000]  And after the third or fourth time, I said to a lady, it was always women. I said, ma'am, do you see all these other people out there with kids?
[02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:31.000]  My dad would take me out here. This is, this is, this is a jetty. People come out here and fish. It's a giant granite jetty, concrete paved.
[02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:41.000]  I'm taking my kids out. I've got them on my iPhone. We ought to load that up and show it with pelicans flying around, white and brown and brown pelicans.
[02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:48.000]  And it was so clear you could see sea turtles swimming around. Dolphins were everywhere. I mean, it was just beautiful.
[02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:55.000]  And then my toddler tends to fall asleep at about noon. She's not really taking naps every day now, but around noon. So she's on my shoulders.
[02:36:55.000 --> 02:37:03.000]  We're walking back the 150 yards or so on the jetty and it's a beautiful sunny day and she's conked out, falls asleep with her head resting on my head.
[02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:09.000]  And people start running over going, is she okay? Did she get hurt?
[02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:17.000]  And my mom's been noticing this. She jogs on the hike and bike trail and she has a French bulldog and they naturally have Bob Tails.
[02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:25.000]  And she has people say to her, but not, but like, she's not human. They'll run by and go, what did you do to her tail?
[02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:31.000]  Or what did you do to its tail? And this happened a few times when I had a dog who got out of the fence. He's dead now.
[02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:43.000]  Helmet German Shepherd Irish Sutter mix. I had him back in college. He died just a few years ago and he got out, got out of the fence, got hit by a car.
[02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:52.000]  And I knew he had escaped. So I was running out looking for him, driving around, found him about half mile away, laying up on the sidewalk, bleeding hit by a car.
[02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:58.000]  And I took him to the vet. They wanted to amputate his leg. Thought he would die. I said, no, don't amputate it. I give him massages and stuff.
[02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:01.000]  And most of the leg came back and he'd swing it when he ran.
[02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:09.000]  I mean, it got so, so this would happen and they'd say, oh, what's wrong? Is there something in his paw? Did you do it? Did he hurt you?
[02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:18.000]  See, these are control freaks and they're all environmentalists. You'll also notice because they have to say everybody is bad.
[02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:24.000]  Yeah, it's called Eco Snoop. Eco Snoop.com. Eco Snoop is not big brother. And then it's got them taddling on everyone.
[02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:28.000]  There it is on screen. Good job finding that so quickly, guys.
[02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:37.000]  In fact, you might want to pull up some of their videos where they're taddling. They're going, I'm here at this rest stop and it looks like these bushes are untrimmed.
[02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:44.000]  That is environmentally bad. I mean, just they're just every, I mean, there's hundreds of videos on there of the Eco Snooping.
[02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:51.000]  But it's getting worse and worse and worse and worse and worse. Oh, oh, you hurt your dog. Oh, you hurt your kids.
[02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:55.000]  I mean, you yell at your kids now. They call the police on you.
[02:38:55.000 --> 02:39:00.000]  And I know I'm digressing, but this is an important subject.
[02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:11.000]  And we are a mentally ill domesticated TV head population where these yuppies are so uncomfortable being in nature and they're just going around.
[02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:19.000]  I guess it's because I'm in a good mood because I noticed they were all real quiet and upset and the women were all bossing their husbands and kids around.
[02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:25.000]  And I just see that everywhere now. It's an upside down world with these crazy neurotic, you know, they're on Prozac.
[02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:31.000]  You know, their kids are on Redland and the old ladies are weirdo and her husband's walking behind her like she's the Queen of England.
[02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:35.000]  And I noticed all these men walk behind their wives.
[02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:42.000]  And I remember when I dated a lot of different women in college, some would get mad because I'd be walking in front of them and I'd open the door for them.
[02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:45.000]  But I'd, you know, kind of, I'm the boss and I'm not telling them what to do.
[02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000]  But of course, there's a lot of women. That's what they like.
[02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:55.000]  But I mean, it's, but, but it's the opposite. It's the woman is the boss and the woman decides everything.
[02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:59.000]  And then the women are so unhappy because they're not, that's not the order of things.
[02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:03.000]  This is not what they like deep down, but this is what they believe.
[02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:07.000]  And these men, the men did not talk, only the women talked.
[02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:13.000]  And I kept, and by the end I was walking by groups and just waiting to hear a man talk and the women were all shouting orders.
[02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:18.000]  And bossing, bossing people around. They'll bring that baby down here.
[02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:24.000]  Don't get just, just nuts.
[02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:27.000]  You know, I talked to friends of mine and things that are having trouble with their wives or girlfriends.
[02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:32.000]  And I say, look, have you tried being the man?
[02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:38.000]  And some of them tried. They go, my God, my wife's happy now.
[02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.000]  I mean, that's how it works.
[02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:45.000]  I mean, but I mean, I'm not going to, I mean, again, these women would love to run death camps.
[02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:48.000]  They'd love to put, they'd love to take your property, love to take your house.
[02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:52.000]  I mean, there are a bunch of sick freaks and their men are a bunch of sick freaks.
[02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:57.000]  And he was going to satisfy his wife. I thought he's not taking photos of my kids down there because I'm looking at him.
[02:40:57.000 --> 02:41:05.000]  And then he looks at me and I was, and then they're talking about us.
[02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000]  So they're not supposed to be down there.
[02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:11.000]  They're not supposed to, but they don't address you. It's like some weird cowardly thing.
[02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:18.000]  Like if they just, look, there it is, gas station with lots of lights on during the day.
[02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:20.000]  You notice it's totally raining and dark out there.
[02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:22.000]  So they automatically kicked in because you need to have light.
[02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:26.000]  So it's a, it's a dark day, but it says, oh, looks like dusk.
[02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:29.000]  The ground is wet. You can see storm clouds off in the distance.
[02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:34.000]  So the automatic lights kick on and they're, oh my gosh, oh, call the police immediately.
[02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:39.000]  The green police. Remember that?
[02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:46.000]  And we laugh about this, but listen, it got worse. It got worse than I'm getting all the news.
[02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:50.000]  About twice a week when I take my kids out, I'll get them a roll of lifesavers.
[02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:53.000]  It's got corn syrup, but it's a treat.
[02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:59.000]  I go in this big nice gas station in our neighborhood and I'm sitting there going, is this all your gum?
[02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:06.000]  Because every brand, and they've got one brand of bubble gum that doesn't have aspartame,
[02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:09.000]  which is the feces of a genetically engineered bacteria.
[02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:12.000]  And I'm going, hey man, this is all got aspartame.
[02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:14.000]  But you guys get some stuff in the store as a consumer.
[02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:17.000]  I'm supposed to talk to fellow humans and communicate at the market.
[02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000]  And the guys are all fans behind the counter.
[02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000]  Day night shift doesn't matter.
[02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:28.000]  And I'm sitting there and I'm saying, and I've got toddler on my hip.
[02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:30.000]  I got my two kids. Stay right here.
[02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:31.000]  Busy parking lot out there.
[02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000]  And when I want this, I want that.
[02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:38.000]  I go, look, honey, this has aspartame that a genetically engineered bacteria creates.
[02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:40.000]  The Pentagon developed it in 1968.
[02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:42.000]  Rumsville got it approved in 81.
[02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:44.000]  It's a chemical weapon that's also very addictive.
[02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:51.000]  And some guy goes, oh, come on, who's buying a 12 pack of beer at the checkout counter.
[02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000]  He's like, oh, come on.
[02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:54.000]  I went, no, sir.
[02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:59.000]  When you get home, Google aspartame manufacturing process.
[02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:03.000]  And I said, look, every one of these says aspartame that, you know, they wanted gum,
[02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:07.000]  but I had to only give them lifesavers and tech tax because they didn't have aspartame in it.
[02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:11.000]  And I said, why suddenly does 99% of the candy have aspartame in it?
[02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:17.000]  Even when it's sugar gum, this is not sugarless.
[02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:21.000]  And some other guy starts laughing as I start preaching.
[02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:24.000]  I said, listen, as a human being, I'm supposed to talk to you.
[02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:25.000]  I'm supposed to warn you.
[02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:26.000]  I care about all of you.
[02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:28.000]  I want to warn you.
[02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:29.000]  And the guys are kind of getting comfortable.
[02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:31.000]  They go, yeah, Alex, we appreciate it.
[02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:32.000]  Okay.
[02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:34.000]  And so I get the tech tax.
[02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:35.000]  I get the bottled water.
[02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:37.000]  I get the lifesavers.
[02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:40.000]  But then I saw the other side.
[02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:50.000]  Jason Bermas calls me as I'm walking out to tell me the DVDs had come in.
[02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:56.000]  And suddenly one person, two person, three people, a whole carload, a carload of high school kids.
[02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:57.000]  Alex Jones, we love you.
[02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:58.000]  Did I death in the new world order?
[02:43:58.000 --> 02:43:59.000]  All the cars.
[02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:01.000]  I mean, literally it was just like 20 people.
[02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.000]  Alex Jones, we love you.
[02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:10.000]  So I was immersed in all these demons on the other side, the zombies, the mind slaves,
[02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:17.000]  the people that can't see what's going on and who were in this mode of tyranny and in this mode of laughing at someone who they over here,
[02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:21.000]  warning their children as an adult, I'm supposed to talk to my kids.
[02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:29.000]  That's weird to them that I would, in the modern fields, as a hunter-gatherer, I come in with my credits to buy something.
[02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:30.000]  And I'm saying, this is a poison plant.
[02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:32.000]  This one is a good plant.
[02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:37.000]  A normal human 10,000 years ago would tell their young, do not eat the bungaberry.
[02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:39.000]  You may eat the chabungaberry.
[02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.000]  You know, this is good in the autumn.
[02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:42.000]  How do you know the autumn?
[02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:44.000]  You know, when the leaves fall, you may eat this fruit.
[02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.000]  Do not eat it before or it is poison.
[02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:51.000]  It would be like, my gosh, bungabunga, why are you telling little chadunga and little mumbabumba?
[02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:52.000]  You know, something's bad.
[02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:53.000]  You're not supposed to do that.
[02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:55.000]  You're not supposed to talk to your kids.
[02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.000]  You're not supposed to carry your kids on a green belt.
[02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:59.000]  You're not supposed to walk around.
[02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:01.000]  You're not supposed to stick your hands in a stream.
[02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:04.000]  You're not supposed to be human.
[02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:06.000]  And so I was really starting to freak out.
[02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:08.000]  I was like, my God, there's crazy people everywhere.
[02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:10.000]  And then I walk out in the sunshine.
[02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:16.000]  It's a parking lot on a Sunday, you know, like noon, beautiful blue skies.
[02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:18.000]  And it's Alex Jones.
[02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:19.000]  And I was like, thank you.
[02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:20.000]  Thank you.
[02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:21.000]  I'm shaking hands.
[02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:23.000]  People are running up and I'm like, Bermas, I got to call you back.
[02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:25.000]  This is incredible.
[02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:26.000]  I mean, just like Alex Jones.
[02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:28.000]  Oh, we love you.
[02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:31.000]  So again, we're having an effect.
[02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:34.000]  And that's probably why they're going to kill me or set me up pretty soon.
[02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:38.000]  But it doesn't matter because we've done our job and I care about all the children.
[02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:39.000]  I care about all the people.
[02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:41.000]  I want to tell people of something's poison.
[02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:45.000]  I want to tell them my people if the water is good to drink.
[02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:48.000]  I want to tell the people when there's bad controllers.
[02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:51.000]  I just am a human who wants the tribe to do well.
[02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:53.000]  The human species.
[02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:55.000]  I want goodness.
[02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:58.000]  I'm not bad for taking my children down to the creek.
[02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:02.000]  I'm not bad for warning them there's poison in the food.
[02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:05.000]  I'm not bad.
[02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:10.000]  The people taking photos of me and my kids to report us are the ones that are bad.
[02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:14.000]  The people looking for trouble and wanting to boss people around who find power through the government.
[02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:16.000]  They're the ones that are bad.
[02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:18.000]  They're the enemies of our society.
[02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:22.000]  They're the enemies of our republic and they're dangerous and the difference.
[02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:30.000]  All my fans were shining faced, good looking, smart people and they were glowing and happy and had life force.
[02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:36.000]  I noticed as I pulled out watching the two guys that laughed at me in their BMWs, wealthy.
[02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:40.000]  They were looking at me just going,
[02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:44.000]  because they've bought into the world and so they're not satisfied.
[02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:47.000]  Here are all these people that are on the same wavelength as I am.
[02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:48.000]  They had power.
[02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:49.000]  They had life force.
[02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:54.000]  They had sparkle in the eye.
[02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:57.000]  They're torturing me off at some dungeon some day or I'm in prison.
[02:46:57.000 --> 02:47:02.000]  I'll remember all those people we warned, all those people we woke up, how many people we saved,
[02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:05.000]  how many people's minds we unlocked so they could see the bigger world and be free.
[02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:11.000]  And I know in the end we're going to beat this new world order.
[02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:16.000]  But that was a great parable and it's true.
[02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:24.000]  Everything that you just heard is what happened yesterday.
[02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:30.000]  For an hour and a half I was submerged in just mass mental illness and crazy control freaks.
[02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:33.000]  And then I went into the store and it was even worse.
[02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:38.000]  But then when I came out into the sunshine, it was just like Alex Jones.
[02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:39.000]  So he goes, Alex Jones.
[02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:46.000]  It was like eight pumps and it's Alex Jones, Alex Jones, Alex Jones, teenagers running up Alex Jones.
[02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:51.000]  And they had basketballs and footballs and we're all happy and we're piling in to go have fun.
[02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:54.000]  We love you, we're going to beat the new world order.
[02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:56.000]  Alex, I'm driving out.
[02:47:56.000 --> 02:48:11.000]  Alex, hey, you know, I mean, we're going to beat the new world order if those good people realize the power they have and if they take action.
[02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:19.000]  Now I've just spent 20-something minutes telling the story because it's so important.
[02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:25.000]  I said I'd go to your phone calls and I've got all this news to head and I've got a guest coming up.
[02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:28.000]  But let's go ahead and talk to Bobby in Tennessee.
[02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:32.000]  Bobby, you're on the air.
[02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:35.000]  Okay, Mark and Georgia, go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:39.000]  Let me get off the speakerphone right quick.
[02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:48.000]  Yeah, I just recently had a very encouraging conversation with the Council for American Islamic Relations and they were pleased that
[02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:54.000]  I was trying to be fair to them and asking their cooperation.
[02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:59.000]  There have been those that have attacked you claiming that you're a, well, I'm going to be clear.
[02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:04.000]  I want to propose a remedy that those that accuse you of being a Zionist shill,
[02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:13.000]  I call for all people of the book to convene and scholarly understanding of each other to draft a covenant of the people of the book
[02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:22.000]  that the problem is not Islam, Judaism or Christianity that there are counterfeits of these, including a counterfeit of Judaism.
[02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:25.000]  Well, I agree with you, but hold on just a minute.
[02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:31.000]  I mean, I'm talking about all this stuff happening and how I'm under attack by CNN, the Southern Property Law Center, everything.
[02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:38.000]  All those big white supremacist organizations have been proven over and over again to be feds in federal court.
[02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:44.000]  Of course, I mean, they got groups that accuse me of working for the Vatican. I'm not even Catholic, but I'm not bashing Catholics here.
[02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:49.000]  They accuse me of working for the Russians because I go on Russian TV.
[02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:54.000]  And in the article Paul Watson today wrote about Russian government probably staged the event.
[02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:57.000]  There's people saying I work for the Russians and I'm covering up for them.
[02:49:57.000 --> 02:50:01.000]  I mean, a lot of this isn't the government. It's just angry mentally ill people.
[02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:05.000]  I mean, I go to your calls and it's just not even about I'm not mad at you caller.
[02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:10.000]  It's just it isn't about Alex Jones. Whatever I am, I know I'm good.
[02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:13.000]  I know I'm for real. It's but it doesn't matter.
[02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:17.000]  What? How does that stop people from going out and fighting corruption on their own?
[02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:26.000]  No matter how many times I cover the USS Liberty or how many times I have on a rear interview with James Traficant,
[02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:31.000]  or no matter how many times I have on people to cover this stuff, they're always going to say that.
[02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:36.000]  Okay, so I mean, it's just it's a pointless call. I mean, I'm not mad at you, sir.
[02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:39.000]  It's just I mean, what does it even do?
[02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:43.000]  People tell new and bigger lies about me every day.
[02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:51.000]  You name it, they've said it literally and none of it is true. None of it. None of it.
[02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:57.000]  I mean, there's thousands of videos where they edit together what I have to say.
[02:50:57.000 --> 02:51:01.000]  I mean, it's all deception. How does that keep us from taking action?
[02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:40.000]  And at survivalistseeds.com, we now offer 50 non GMO varieties of vegetables and over 10,000 heirloom seeds.
[02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:45.000]  That's twice as many as our competition for the same price.

[02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:26.000]  The United Nations would take over America. The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:34.000]  Invisible Empire Chronicles, how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:40.000]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:46.000]  The global governance with the establishment of the G20. So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:49.000]  And I got news for you. You're everyone else.

[02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:24.000]  Deep down in Luziana, close to New Orleans, way back up in the woods among the evergreens.

[02:55:58.160 --> 02:55:59.640]  i believe the headline is
[02:55:59.640 --> 02:56:03.360]  subway bombing in moscow another fsb false flag
[02:56:03.360 --> 02:56:04.680]  question mark
[02:56:04.680 --> 02:56:07.040]  and in road to tyranny
[02:56:07.040 --> 02:56:11.360]  and in my book dissent into tyranny and in several other films
[02:56:11.360 --> 02:56:12.520]  we show how
[02:56:12.520 --> 02:56:15.840]  police in multiple cities
[02:56:15.840 --> 02:56:21.560]  in ninety nine caught fsb federal security bureau
[02:56:21.560 --> 02:56:25.560]  former kgb since the new kgb planting hexagon bombs
[02:56:25.560 --> 02:56:27.000]  in the buildings
[02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:28.780]  is a three big apartment
[02:56:28.780 --> 02:56:32.000]  houses got blown up when the chest is just said we didn't do it why would we
[02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:33.680]  do that have you come and made us
[02:56:33.680 --> 02:56:36.520]  and we fight you here
[02:56:36.520 --> 02:56:39.120]  and you know it's a great military move that that's why all these big
[02:56:39.120 --> 02:56:40.080]  governments do it
[02:56:40.080 --> 02:56:41.360]  to bomb yourself
[02:56:41.360 --> 02:56:44.400]  to be able to go start a new war and invade somebody
[02:56:44.400 --> 02:56:48.360]  uh... and so fsb is famous for this that the stars
[02:56:48.360 --> 02:56:50.680]  you know ninety years ago
[02:56:50.680 --> 02:56:53.720]  uh... we're incredibly famous for staging false flags and here's the
[02:56:53.720 --> 02:56:54.620]  article
[02:56:54.620 --> 02:56:59.240]  moscow metro blast another fsb inside job question mark
[02:56:59.240 --> 02:57:01.520]  and watson goes over the history of it
[02:57:01.520 --> 02:57:04.520]  and i and i don't know if it's in this version of the info or version of the
[02:57:04.520 --> 02:57:05.980]  stock on this morning going
[02:57:05.980 --> 02:57:08.680]  why is jones covering up for russia you know he
[02:57:08.680 --> 02:57:11.040]  he's covering up
[02:57:11.040 --> 02:57:13.040]  all i i i just tell the truth i mean
[02:57:13.040 --> 02:57:17.480]  when the united states in nato in israel with georgia snuck attack south
[02:57:17.480 --> 02:57:19.760]  olsadia and abkhazia on record
[02:57:19.760 --> 02:57:21.800]  and ran a giant hoax
[02:57:21.800 --> 02:57:25.520]  since and now it's come out shiny one to start nuclear war that's confirmed
[02:57:25.520 --> 02:57:28.800]  that was wrong and crazy
[02:57:28.800 --> 02:57:30.220]  and
[02:57:30.220 --> 02:57:32.060]  i don't like the iranian government
[02:57:32.060 --> 02:57:35.120]  they were a lot of bad things government itself is bad almost every in
[02:57:35.120 --> 02:57:39.120]  every case but i expose the fact that our governments lying about iran running
[02:57:39.120 --> 02:57:40.040]  al-qaeda
[02:57:40.040 --> 02:57:44.040]  and so my job is easy i have to gauge things are say what's popular or what's
[02:57:44.040 --> 02:57:44.920]  not
[02:57:44.920 --> 02:57:46.280]  i just say
[02:57:46.280 --> 02:57:49.760]  what i research what's fair what can i prove
[02:57:49.760 --> 02:57:51.360]  and
[02:57:51.360 --> 02:57:52.720]  so
[02:57:52.720 --> 02:57:54.320]  it doesn't matter if
[02:57:54.320 --> 02:57:58.640]  russia today which is english just like al jazeera or bbc's in the u.s i go on
[02:57:58.640 --> 02:57:59.880]  that probably every week
[02:57:59.880 --> 02:58:02.920]  and if they have me on about these are probably won't
[02:58:02.920 --> 02:58:05.240]  but they have me on about these uh...
[02:58:05.240 --> 02:58:09.040]  these these railway bombings i'll talk about i mean i'll say what we need to look
[02:58:09.040 --> 02:58:10.480]  at the fsb
[02:58:10.480 --> 02:58:12.320]  uh... but uh...

[03:00:27.240 --> 03:00:30.520]  against false flag terrorism
[03:00:30.520 --> 03:00:33.720]  whether it's the chinese that do it the russians the u.s the israeli the
[03:00:33.720 --> 03:00:34.480]  british
[03:00:34.480 --> 03:00:35.600]  they all do it
[03:00:35.600 --> 03:00:38.840]  my dad was talking about a famous history book called whirlwind i'm going to
[03:00:38.840 --> 03:00:41.320]  get a copy at his house of it
[03:00:41.320 --> 03:00:45.120]  pull up the book whirlwind it's a famous author
[03:00:45.120 --> 03:00:46.880]  the point is it was all about
[03:00:46.880 --> 03:00:50.120]  the islamic revolution and my dad was going to look at this and was at his
[03:00:50.120 --> 03:00:52.160]  house a few days ago
[03:00:52.160 --> 03:00:55.520]  uh... he was going to look at this and it's it's got where it was admitted in the
[03:00:55.520 --> 03:00:57.200]  seventies that the israelis
[03:00:57.200 --> 03:00:58.600]  would bomb
[03:00:58.600 --> 03:00:59.920]  british
[03:00:59.920 --> 03:01:03.440]  troops and then blame it on iran and and and in this country would do it to that
[03:01:03.440 --> 03:01:06.120]  country and they just basically all do it
[03:01:06.120 --> 03:01:09.880]  and then the media when you talk about it goes how dare you you america hater you
[03:01:09.880 --> 03:01:14.640]  israel hater look i just tell the truth
[03:01:14.640 --> 03:01:15.800]  that's it james
[03:01:15.800 --> 03:01:20.400]  prevails whirlwind from the author of shogun and
[03:01:20.400 --> 03:01:23.680]  noble horse
[03:01:23.680 --> 03:01:27.040]  noble house but i guess that's a
[03:01:27.040 --> 03:01:30.480]  that's a fiction he had two books said one was fiction one was on it may have been
[03:01:30.480 --> 03:01:32.600]  another author he was showing me two books on
[03:01:32.600 --> 03:01:33.680]  phone rang on
[03:01:33.680 --> 03:01:35.480]  i forgot to look at the point is
[03:01:35.480 --> 03:01:41.920]  you know it's also in fiction like grand greens the quiet america in a movie
[03:01:41.920 --> 03:01:43.280]  and uh...
[03:01:43.280 --> 03:01:46.520]  you know the cia is in vietnam and
[03:01:46.520 --> 03:01:52.720]  uh... the late fifties they're taken over from the uh...
[03:01:52.720 --> 03:01:53.480]  french
[03:01:53.480 --> 03:01:56.680]  and indochina
[03:01:56.680 --> 03:01:58.660]  and
[03:01:58.660 --> 03:02:00.080]  now vietnam
[03:02:00.080 --> 03:02:03.520]  and you know the cia staging terror attacks there
[03:02:03.520 --> 03:02:07.200]  and of course that's a fiction but it's it's based as a composite it's kind of
[03:02:07.200 --> 03:02:08.520]  like
[03:02:08.520 --> 03:02:10.240]  the movie uh...
[03:02:10.240 --> 03:02:12.280]  patriot
[03:02:12.280 --> 03:02:15.480]  and you know you read history study history and you forget most of it years
[03:02:15.480 --> 03:02:19.720]  later but i i i i read quite a few books about the swamp fox in south carolina
[03:02:19.720 --> 03:02:21.560]  and about other militia leaders
[03:02:21.560 --> 03:02:24.480]  and when you're watching that move you're like all that historically happened
[03:02:24.480 --> 03:02:25.720]  that happened
[03:02:25.720 --> 03:02:29.480]  but that was somebody else and that was and what they just rolled three
[03:02:29.480 --> 03:02:30.600]  and later i
[03:02:30.600 --> 03:02:34.240]  already knew that then later i read
[03:02:34.240 --> 03:02:38.560]  some articles by people involved in the movie saying oh it's a composite
[03:02:38.560 --> 03:02:45.060]  like colonel tavington was a real person
[03:02:45.060 --> 03:02:47.560]  i'm already digressing here and we got a guest coming up i'm just gonna have a
[03:02:47.560 --> 03:02:50.240]  guest on for two segments i do have to get this news

[03:03:26.520 --> 03:03:31.040]  uh... before i make my comment about the uh... so-called religious right
[03:03:31.040 --> 03:03:34.020]  you know the situation you had at the store
[03:03:34.020 --> 03:03:37.880]  you know it's really surreal isn't that where you're all of a sudden you know
[03:03:37.880 --> 03:03:42.160]  i and this has been coming but you're surrounded with and facing
[03:03:42.160 --> 03:03:47.440]  something far worse than georgio was nineteen eighty four wouldn't you say
[03:03:47.440 --> 03:03:50.920]  all it was crazy but then i walked outside and was mobbed by people that
[03:03:50.920 --> 03:03:52.440]  are patriots so
[03:03:52.440 --> 03:03:55.920]  it's it's real battle lines in the parasites are trying to
[03:03:55.920 --> 03:03:59.640]  take over the same world with their insanity
[03:03:59.640 --> 03:04:03.160]  yellow you know i make a comment to people i don't know give me this
[03:04:03.160 --> 03:04:05.680]  chuckle it's like a nervous laugh and then it
[03:04:05.680 --> 03:04:07.600]  white clicks on a fatal you know
[03:04:07.600 --> 03:04:10.480]  with tv what do you think they call it programming
[03:04:10.480 --> 03:04:12.560]  uh... if you know you're right
[03:04:12.560 --> 03:04:15.680]  now that leads me to what i called about real quick and that's the so-called
[03:04:15.680 --> 03:04:19.760]  religious right i am a bible-believing born again christian
[03:04:19.760 --> 03:04:21.920]  and the thing is though
[03:04:21.920 --> 03:04:26.440]  i really see the so-called religious right the people that
[03:04:26.440 --> 03:04:28.600]  you know claim to believe the way i do
[03:04:28.600 --> 03:04:33.480]  in jesus christ alone is the only way salvation at the biggest hindrance

[03:04:37.640 --> 03:04:39.080]  what i want to take

[03:04:46.840 --> 03:04:50.360]  ought to be the professing christians but yet
[03:04:50.360 --> 03:04:53.120]  they seem to be the ones most adamantly

[03:09:47.560 --> 03:09:50.400]  you can't make this stuff up folks it's just and she's dead and then they

[03:09:52.960 --> 03:09:55.720]  i review so many people they get killed it's like uh...
[03:09:55.720 --> 03:09:58.280]  if you have first-time knowledge of this stuff you better get it all on the
[03:09:58.280 --> 03:10:00.200]  plate and fast
[03:10:00.200 --> 03:10:02.840]  it's like the dc madame we had a run i said you will not commit suicide
[03:10:02.840 --> 03:10:04.600]  correct said i will not commit suicide
[03:10:04.600 --> 03:10:07.360]  in the media said oh she committed suicide then we
[03:10:07.360 --> 03:10:08.680]  call her
[03:10:08.680 --> 03:10:12.240]  landlord or condo she'd known for over a decade he said she said we're
[03:10:12.240 --> 03:10:14.560]  following her that they might kill her
[03:10:14.560 --> 03:10:16.600]  uh... she was going to go to prison that she was moving her stuff to her
[03:10:16.600 --> 03:10:17.720]  mother's house
[03:10:17.720 --> 03:10:20.280]  and they killed her
[03:10:20.280 --> 03:10:22.480]  then we then he sent me her handwriting
[03:10:22.480 --> 03:10:25.400]  from her lease was not anything like
[03:10:25.400 --> 03:10:29.160]  every letter was different her supposed suicide letter
[03:10:29.160 --> 03:10:32.320]  god almighty folks and you can come on the air and say i'm not going to kill
[03:10:32.320 --> 03:10:34.160]  myself
[03:10:34.160 --> 03:10:37.360]  you go on the air and say i'm not going to kill myself and then they kill you
[03:10:37.360 --> 03:10:40.280]  they'll even shoot you twice in the back of the head like
[03:10:40.280 --> 03:10:44.600]  they did uh... gary webb and say it was a suicide
[03:10:44.600 --> 03:10:48.040]  then they had his supposed friend we'd actually criticize the newspapers is not
[03:10:48.040 --> 03:10:49.080]  as friend
[03:10:49.080 --> 03:10:55.280]  come out and say oh i'm his friend it's quite normal to shoot yourself twice in the head
[03:10:55.280 --> 03:10:56.600]  i'll say it again
[03:10:56.600 --> 03:11:00.760]  if god forbid that happens to me i did not kill myself it is a lie it is a lie it
[03:11:00.760 --> 03:11:06.400]  is a lie it is a lie it is a lie it is a lie
[03:11:06.400 --> 03:11:09.360]  all right i'm gonna shut up we're not playing games here we got a lot of stuff
[03:11:09.360 --> 03:11:12.840]  to cover uh... this ties in with the moscow blast all this hype about women
[03:11:12.840 --> 03:11:14.120]  with breast implants
[03:11:14.120 --> 03:11:16.400]  how they now want to x-ray you to fly
[03:11:16.400 --> 03:11:20.080]  and have mobile x-ray trucks that uh... powerful chest x-rays
[03:11:20.080 --> 03:11:21.400]  because the terrorists can
[03:11:21.400 --> 03:11:23.720]  have a surgeon put it into their breast
[03:11:23.720 --> 03:11:27.960]  and now they're saying their faces were undamaged it may be a breast bomb
[03:11:27.960 --> 03:11:31.000]  terrorists could use explosives and breast implants
[03:11:31.000 --> 03:11:34.520]  the body scanners now we played the footage of homeland security videos with
[03:11:34.520 --> 03:11:38.240]  the big mobile eighteen wheelers that are going to make a body scan you
[03:11:38.240 --> 03:11:41.480]  he has introduced legislation it's got a good chance of passing if you get behind
[03:11:41.480 --> 03:11:47.320]  a representative phil hart idaho house district three seat b
[03:11:47.320 --> 03:11:49.160]  he is a uh...

[03:11:52.880 --> 03:11:55.920]  as a licensed civil and structural engineer in eleven states
[03:11:55.920 --> 03:11:57.960]  and uh...

[03:12:03.280 --> 03:12:03.800]  us

[03:12:06.240 --> 03:12:08.840]  and i was honored to find out he found out a lot about
[03:12:08.840 --> 03:12:12.080]  about the stuff here on the show to have you here representative
[03:12:12.080 --> 03:12:14.320]  i think i'll have me on
[03:12:14.320 --> 03:12:18.280]  so tell us about uh... yourself your awakening why you're doing this and and
[03:12:18.280 --> 03:12:19.440]  how we can help you
[03:12:19.440 --> 03:12:21.320]  start a movement of the state level
[03:12:21.320 --> 03:12:26.200]  to say no to the child porn law violating naked body scanners
[03:12:26.200 --> 03:12:30.000]  well i like my parents got me started politics when i was eight years old and
[03:12:30.000 --> 03:12:33.560]  i was going door to door for very goldwater passing out leaflets and
[03:12:33.560 --> 03:12:37.480]  and stuff and things and people's door and uh... they were really quite the
[03:12:37.480 --> 03:12:40.720]  activists we had a mimeograph machine our house and we were
[03:12:40.720 --> 03:12:42.960]  were constantly going to meetings and
[03:12:42.960 --> 03:12:45.880]  right now on literature and pass it out and
[03:12:45.880 --> 03:12:49.080]  i guess it just carried over and i got to become an adult you know you see
[03:12:49.080 --> 03:12:52.640]  what's going on around the world and it is hard to sit still i mean
[03:12:52.640 --> 03:12:56.840]  we're really in a fight for the republic and uh... i think it's going to take
[03:12:56.840 --> 03:12:59.000]  each one of us assuming that
[03:12:59.000 --> 03:13:03.760]  the republic that it depends on what we do to save our republic and so i'm
[03:13:03.760 --> 03:13:07.600]  busy at the state level uh... working in the idaho legislature trying to do
[03:13:07.600 --> 03:13:09.700]  uh... pass legislation that's gonna
[03:13:09.700 --> 03:13:11.840]  protect our liberties
[03:13:11.840 --> 03:13:16.660]  well that's awesome uh... will what got you fired up against this
[03:13:16.660 --> 03:13:19.120]  naked body scanners in your state
[03:13:19.120 --> 03:13:23.120]  well i've seen a couple of them as i've flown around the uh... the the country
[03:13:23.120 --> 03:13:25.480]  but i also listen to your show quite a bit alex and i
[03:13:25.480 --> 03:13:27.440]  you know through your show i've been uh...
[03:13:27.440 --> 03:13:30.440]  kind of keeping a price of what's going on and i thought you know there's any
[03:13:30.440 --> 03:13:32.320]  reason why we can't put some
[03:13:32.320 --> 03:13:35.640]  sideboards on the use of these things at the state level
[03:13:35.640 --> 03:13:40.360]  and uh... so what i did is i took some legislation that was drafted by
[03:13:40.360 --> 03:13:43.920]  congressman uh... jason chevets of of utah
[03:13:43.920 --> 03:13:48.320]  and i changed it a little bit and made it apply more to the state level uh...
[03:13:48.320 --> 03:13:51.920]  his bill has gotten through the house of representatives back in washington dc
[03:13:51.920 --> 03:13:54.320]  is currently stalled in the senate
[03:13:54.320 --> 03:13:58.240]  so i i came up with basically a state version of that bill and and uh...
[03:13:58.240 --> 03:14:00.280]  uh... made it apply to state
[03:14:00.280 --> 03:14:04.120]  uh... facilities and public facilities and and uh... we're running with it at
[03:14:04.120 --> 03:14:05.360]  the state level and
[03:14:05.360 --> 03:14:07.960]  we got it out of the house of representatives about two weeks ago
[03:14:07.960 --> 03:14:11.160]  and and now my bill is stalled in the senate at the moment
[03:14:11.160 --> 03:14:14.720]  well we need to attack at every level peacefully through the legislative
[03:14:14.720 --> 03:14:16.160]  process as you know
[03:14:16.160 --> 03:14:18.640]  we need to put pressure on the u s senate
[03:14:18.640 --> 03:14:21.960]  i mean in every poll upwards of ninety percent are against these naked body
[03:14:21.960 --> 03:14:23.120]  scanners
[03:14:23.120 --> 03:14:26.760]  and we need to go to the state level as well and try and every state
[03:14:26.760 --> 03:14:28.000]  to say no
[03:14:28.000 --> 03:14:30.080]  uh... so it'll set a precedent
[03:14:30.080 --> 03:14:34.520]  uh... how do we help you uh... get this done in the state of i don't
[03:14:34.520 --> 03:14:39.520]  well we've got a few days left in our session and uh... it it's possible that
[03:14:39.520 --> 03:14:43.000]  we can still get this done if it became a high priority so
[03:14:43.000 --> 03:14:45.840]  for those of your listeners are from my door or or
[03:14:45.840 --> 03:14:49.480]  really from anywhere call into the state legislature uh... director called the
[03:14:49.480 --> 03:14:50.720]  senate have them that
[03:14:50.720 --> 03:14:54.160]  here this bill it's house bill five seventy three
[03:14:54.160 --> 03:14:57.160]  but you know i don't get it done uh... this year
[03:14:57.160 --> 03:15:00.480]  i've got the bill drafted the bugs have been worked out of it i'll just
[03:15:00.480 --> 03:15:03.880]  introduce the right the very beginning of next year and i think it'll go next
[03:15:03.880 --> 03:15:04.800]  year
[03:15:04.800 --> 03:15:07.240]  well you've got a lot of public support don't you
[03:15:07.240 --> 03:15:09.760]  i do yeah i haven't had any negative
[03:15:09.760 --> 03:15:13.320]  feedback on this from the public and when people find out i'm working on the
[03:15:13.320 --> 03:15:16.160]  they encourage me to you know keep pushing forward
[03:15:16.160 --> 03:15:18.200]  i've read over the law but but
[03:15:18.200 --> 03:15:20.120]  i mean explain
[03:15:20.120 --> 03:15:23.560]  how these scanners are unconstitutional a violation of rights and
[03:15:23.560 --> 03:15:25.920]  the type of language and attack you're using
[03:15:25.920 --> 03:15:30.680]  to point out uh... that these things need to be barred
[03:15:30.680 --> 03:15:34.960]  well i think it's it's really a tough uh... legal issue i mean we're
[03:15:34.960 --> 03:15:38.840]  at the state level we have plenty of uh... authority to uh... to limit the
[03:15:38.840 --> 03:15:41.800]  use of these things i don't have a state facility but
[03:15:41.800 --> 03:15:45.640]  you know that the big issue is with the airport and uh...
[03:15:45.640 --> 03:15:49.360]  psa is is operating at the airport you know i did a little research and found
[03:15:49.360 --> 03:15:51.480]  out that our airports in idaho are on
[03:15:51.480 --> 03:15:54.200]  date of idaho real estate in other words we haven't
[03:15:54.200 --> 03:15:57.320]  seated that ground of the federal government like you do at some military
[03:15:57.320 --> 03:16:01.680]  basis though so we do have jurisdiction to some degree
[03:16:01.680 --> 03:16:06.440]  typically the federal law trumps the state law unless we're talking about the
[03:16:06.440 --> 03:16:08.080]  police power of the state
[03:16:08.080 --> 03:16:11.800]  which may kick in if we can prove that these things are unhealthy for people
[03:16:11.800 --> 03:16:13.160]  who are exposed to them
[03:16:13.160 --> 03:16:16.840]  because we have a certainly a duty at the state level to protect the health and
[03:16:16.840 --> 03:16:21.240]  and uh... medical condition of our citizens and so that's where i hope we
[03:16:21.240 --> 03:16:22.240]  can uh...
[03:16:22.240 --> 03:16:26.480]  make a good argument that that would allow us to to regulate these in our
[03:16:26.480 --> 03:16:28.400]  airports here in the state of idaho
[03:16:28.400 --> 03:16:31.920]  well i've even seen new york times articles quoting top scientists saying
[03:16:31.920 --> 03:16:33.520]  these millimeter waves
[03:16:33.520 --> 03:16:37.040]  do break up human dna and now they're saying hey
[03:16:37.040 --> 03:16:40.800]  we're not just gonna make a body scan you we want x-rays in there
[03:16:40.800 --> 03:16:45.040]  high-powered to see if you've got explosives in your breast they're now
[03:16:45.040 --> 03:16:48.240]  at airports all over the western world i see it on the news they grab the
[03:16:48.240 --> 03:16:51.320]  woman's breast and squeeze and go in a circle
[03:16:51.320 --> 03:16:55.440]  and paul watson a webmaster in england his girlfriend says it's very painful
[03:16:55.440 --> 03:16:59.480]  and and men grab her breast women grab her breasting they grab men's genitals
[03:16:59.480 --> 03:17:02.520]  i mean this is clearly conditioning and now homeland security i don't know if
[03:17:02.520 --> 03:17:04.200]  you've seen it but guys pull it up
[03:17:04.200 --> 03:17:06.400]  they have these mobile trucks
[03:17:06.400 --> 03:17:09.360]  that are eighteen wheeler backs they're gonna put a sports stadiums
[03:17:09.360 --> 03:17:11.440]  checkpoints this is the on the video
[03:17:11.440 --> 03:17:12.960]  and they march you in
[03:17:12.960 --> 03:17:15.640]  and they say they're gonna have scanners brain scanners i mean this is
[03:17:15.640 --> 03:17:17.200]  insane
[03:17:17.200 --> 03:17:21.360]  one of the arguments that we can make for that particular aspect of this is that
[03:17:21.360 --> 03:17:24.600]  the state have jurisdiction over the things that have traditionally been in
[03:17:24.600 --> 03:17:28.000]  the power of the state the federal government can't just walk into some
[03:17:28.000 --> 03:17:31.720]  new area of our economy or our society and claim that they've got the
[03:17:31.720 --> 03:17:33.840]  jurisdiction and so this is something
[03:17:33.840 --> 03:17:37.480]  the feds have never done before they're going to be doing it in the states on
[03:17:37.480 --> 03:17:41.040]  state real estate if you will and uh... you know they don't have jurisdiction
[03:17:41.040 --> 03:17:42.700]  but if we don't push back
[03:17:42.700 --> 03:17:45.520]  they'll just assume they do have the jurisdiction they'll just go ahead and
[03:17:45.520 --> 03:17:47.160]  do whatever they want
[03:17:47.160 --> 03:17:51.520]  well they know what they're doing and then meanwhile all these homeland
[03:17:51.520 --> 03:17:52.660]  security officials
[03:17:52.660 --> 03:17:54.440]  leave homeland security
[03:17:54.440 --> 03:17:57.440]  in homeland security they make the purchase orders senate to congress they
[03:17:57.440 --> 03:17:59.760]  get it then they leave congress
[03:17:59.760 --> 03:18:00.840]  or they leave
[03:18:00.840 --> 03:18:02.160]  homeland security
[03:18:02.160 --> 03:18:04.920]  and then they revolving door into the corporations
[03:18:04.920 --> 03:18:07.640]  getting millions of dollars i mean this is just openly
[03:18:07.640 --> 03:18:09.480]  illegal
[03:18:09.480 --> 03:18:12.840]  that's right and i'm sure you know that cherd off former director of a home
[03:18:12.840 --> 03:18:17.160]  and security is now a lobbyist representing from the company that make
[03:18:17.160 --> 03:18:20.920]  and he says that's fine because he believes in it
[03:18:20.920 --> 03:18:22.560]  that's like in kentucky
[03:18:22.560 --> 03:18:24.560]  the head of elections is now
[03:18:24.560 --> 03:18:27.720]  running for senate against rand paul and they ruled he can run his own
[03:18:27.720 --> 03:18:28.800]  election
[03:18:28.800 --> 03:18:32.240]  i mean and no state has ever allowed that that's always been illegal this is
[03:18:32.240 --> 03:18:34.000]  just
[03:18:34.000 --> 03:18:39.640]  it's amazing we what we need to do is is research what conditions that gave birth
[03:18:39.640 --> 03:18:41.520]  to the fourth amendment the uh...
[03:18:41.520 --> 03:18:44.520]  the uh... protection against unreasonable search and seizures and i
[03:18:44.520 --> 03:18:46.880]  understand it with the town sent back
[03:18:46.880 --> 03:18:50.880]  that uh... the king uh... are are the british were promoting where they would
[03:18:50.880 --> 03:18:52.600]  go into people's houses
[03:18:52.600 --> 03:18:56.240]  and search for the stamp of the king on all the documents and so
[03:18:56.240 --> 03:19:00.320]  we've got to do some research to find out what exactly were the searches like
[03:19:00.320 --> 03:19:01.560]  and what was it
[03:19:01.560 --> 03:19:04.960]  that the founding fathers were trying to prevent against when they developed the
[03:19:04.960 --> 03:19:08.440]  bill of rights in particularly the fourth amendment and then compare that to
[03:19:08.440 --> 03:19:11.920]  what the feds are doing well we know they would come in anybody's house they
[03:19:11.920 --> 03:19:14.920]  wanted an inspected just like zoning basically
[03:19:14.920 --> 03:19:18.460]  to make sure you had the king's stamp and it was a man's home as his castle
[03:19:18.460 --> 03:19:20.420]  twelve fifteen magna carta
[03:19:20.420 --> 03:19:24.600]  and so the british understood that and we were british at that time and
[03:19:24.600 --> 03:19:28.240]  uh... these were englishmen here and they said we deserve the same rights as
[03:19:28.240 --> 03:19:29.200]  people in england
[03:19:29.200 --> 03:19:32.920]  that the king couldn't do that in england
[03:19:32.920 --> 03:19:37.560]  that's right and and really the people are are gonna have to weigh in and say
[03:19:37.560 --> 03:19:39.440]  that we don't want to put up with this
[03:19:39.440 --> 03:19:42.960]  and we want to push back because uh... you know when we do that
[03:19:42.960 --> 03:19:47.480]  uh... we we can push back and i think if you look at the real id movement
[03:19:47.480 --> 03:19:51.080]  and how a bunch of states stood up to the feds and and passed legislation
[03:19:51.080 --> 03:19:52.080]  against it and
[03:19:52.080 --> 03:19:55.400]  memorials against it and it's really it's loaded down and so we can do the same
[03:19:55.400 --> 03:19:56.040]  thing
[03:19:56.040 --> 03:19:58.320]  with these whole body scanners
[03:19:58.320 --> 03:20:05.320]  we know we've got a fight resistance is victory stay there representative
[03:20:05.320 --> 03:20:06.560]  uh...
[03:20:06.560 --> 03:20:08.560]  afraid to answer it

[03:24:13.280 --> 03:24:17.760]  state representative Phil Hart is our guest at big news blitz coming up on all these
[03:24:17.760 --> 03:24:21.880]  militia arrests as the federal government prepares to stage terror attacks
[03:24:21.880 --> 03:24:25.360]  and blame it on the tea parties I told you in the last three months they're
[03:24:25.360 --> 03:24:29.080]  gonna stage arrest against militias they've set up they've been setting up
[03:24:29.080 --> 03:24:34.120]  for years provocaturing them or flat out framing them they follow a handbook to
[03:24:34.120 --> 03:24:37.160]  create the idea that there are all these terrorists out there that are
[03:24:37.160 --> 03:24:42.520]  domestic then they stage the big events they did this right before the alpha P
[03:24:42.520 --> 03:24:47.160]  Murrow building got bombed April 19th 1995 and I'm seeing all the key
[03:24:47.160 --> 03:24:50.400]  conditioning everything you notice I've been predicting it now it's ramping up
[03:24:50.400 --> 03:24:55.000]  exactly as I said it would because I know their handbook see an intelligence
[03:24:55.000 --> 03:24:57.840]  you don't even have to have all the intelligence documents if you watch
[03:24:57.840 --> 03:25:02.600]  enemy troop movements and propaganda and activities you learn their patterns of
[03:25:02.600 --> 03:25:07.720]  attack and that's basic intelligence gathering you have to get inside their
[03:25:07.720 --> 03:25:11.040]  minds that's the key to understanding what they're gonna do that's coming up
[03:25:11.040 --> 03:25:15.080]  going back to Phil Hart Phil I want to get you back on some time about your
[03:25:15.080 --> 03:25:17.680]  book I haven't read it yet we just got it but it looks really interesting
[03:25:17.680 --> 03:25:22.720]  constitutional income do you have any and we'll be talking about that briefly
[03:25:22.720 --> 03:25:26.760]  here but you're right the states are standing up they're saying no you're in
[03:25:26.760 --> 03:25:32.760]  Idaho what are your constituents saying about the real ID the open borders the
[03:25:32.760 --> 03:25:38.520]  naked body scanners all of it well with regard to real ID we were one of the
[03:25:38.520 --> 03:25:43.600]  eight states that put that that language in our Idaho code that says we will not
[03:25:43.600 --> 03:25:47.960]  comply with real ID but the trouble with real ID is it's gonna morph into
[03:25:47.960 --> 03:25:52.360]  something else I mean there's a half a dozen other drivers license programs out
[03:25:52.360 --> 03:25:56.880]  there that got RFID chips in them and things like that so I was running a bill
[03:25:56.880 --> 03:26:02.800]  this year it was our house bill 541 which would prohibit an RFID chip being
[03:26:02.800 --> 03:26:07.800]  used in Idaho drivers license would prohibit facial recognition techniques
[03:26:07.800 --> 03:26:13.080]  to be used and would also prohibit us from issuing drivers licenses to illegal
[03:26:13.080 --> 03:26:17.080]  aliens you know Alex there's four states that have a public policy where they
[03:26:17.080 --> 03:26:23.640]  they actually do just that well expanding on that they're now saying
[03:26:23.640 --> 03:26:28.440]  every police department needs license plate reading cameras it might stop some
[03:26:28.440 --> 03:26:33.320]  crime well oh you know the schools are issuing laptops that watch the pupils
[03:26:33.320 --> 03:26:37.840]  at home it it might save somebody well yeah I mean if we were all locked up in
[03:26:37.840 --> 03:26:41.960]  jail sales you know maybe everybody will be safe but everyone knows the most
[03:26:41.960 --> 03:26:47.800]  dangerous place in the world is a prison I mean clearly this is all unconstitutional
[03:26:47.800 --> 03:26:53.240]  for a reason because our forebears went through a lesser tyranny than we're
[03:26:53.240 --> 03:26:58.200]  starting to go into and it's time to put the brakes on this and start reversing
[03:26:58.200 --> 03:27:02.840]  it it was the philosophy of the founding fathers that they did not want to
[03:27:02.840 --> 03:27:08.360]  solve every crime and a society that does solve every crime is really a totalitarian
[03:27:08.360 --> 03:27:12.920]  society so we've got the Bill of Rights which are to protect the rights of
[03:27:12.920 --> 03:27:17.160]  innocent people from being you know terrorized if you will by the government
[03:27:17.160 --> 03:27:21.880]  with the idea that you know we're gonna let a few crimes slip through the
[03:27:21.880 --> 03:27:25.320]  thing the system and we're not going to solve every crime because we would
[03:27:25.320 --> 03:27:28.960]  rather have the rights of the people protected and then you know working in
[03:27:28.960 --> 03:27:33.080]  that framework we'll do the best we can to solve the crimes that we can solve
[03:27:33.080 --> 03:27:37.800]  we've got your website up on screen at prisonplanet.tv but for radio listeners

[03:33:51.960 --> 03:33:57.040]  wake-up call now I want to blitz through a bunch of news and try to go to Tim
[03:33:57.040 --> 03:34:03.920]  Tim John Terry Josh and others before this radio broadcast ends today if you
[03:34:03.920 --> 03:34:07.520]  just joined us there's video up on info wars dot com and present planet dot com
[03:34:07.520 --> 03:34:13.360]  in the tiles at the top of the page Alex Jones inside a CNN hit piece they'll
[03:34:13.360 --> 03:34:17.800]  interview you for 15 20 minutes and then edit it down to 30 seconds and they
[03:34:17.800 --> 03:34:20.960]  said they're doing that for Anderson Cooper special about how dangerous and
[03:34:20.960 --> 03:34:26.840]  bad I am and it's about me and they said it was gonna air Friday it did and who
[03:34:26.840 --> 03:34:30.400]  knows because they didn't get what they wanted but you get to see the other side
[03:34:30.400 --> 03:34:33.760]  of the story and it's already well over a hundred thousand hits in a day and a
[03:34:33.760 --> 03:34:38.800]  half views and Anderson Cooper on his top rated night has about 900,000 viewers
[03:34:38.800 --> 03:34:43.240]  usually it's about 300 400,000 so in a couple weeks this video if you get it out
[03:34:43.240 --> 03:34:47.200]  to people will will be bigger than his whole TV show was that night so see
[03:34:47.200 --> 03:34:52.000]  that's why Homeland Security and Obama and North com admit they want to quote
[03:34:52.000 --> 03:34:55.600]  shut down the internet for quote conspiracy terrorist ie anyone that
[03:34:55.600 --> 03:35:01.880]  questions their lives so very very exciting on that front in fact a lot of
[03:35:01.880 --> 03:35:05.520]  times I just refuse CNN interviews because they almost never air them or
[03:35:05.520 --> 03:35:08.280]  they take it out of context that's why I videotaped it maybe I should always
[03:35:08.280 --> 03:35:15.680]  accept the interview videotape it and upload it and say oh okay well oh boy
[03:35:15.680 --> 03:35:21.160]  I remember when I was on AJ Hammers show three times I was on it twice they
[03:35:21.160 --> 03:35:25.560]  played clips the third night and I talked to AJ Hammers producer and he said

[03:40:15.720 --> 03:40:18.640]  that are concerned that are studied history they're trying to defend
[03:40:18.640 --> 03:40:22.600]  themselves you radicalize them you get them to talk about violence or you just
[03:40:22.600 --> 03:40:26.480]  flat-out set them up and hundreds of people have had pipe bombs buried that's
[03:40:26.480 --> 03:40:32.520]  come out in federal court and been set up or it's guys at a bar or the the BATF
[03:40:32.520 --> 03:40:36.840]  took over the Viper motorcycle gang a horrible meth dealers and got them to
[03:40:36.840 --> 03:40:40.760]  say we're a militia now and so they could have the term Viper militia on the
[03:40:40.760 --> 03:40:45.320]  news and every time they start hyping because the company they've always got
[03:40:45.320 --> 03:40:48.080]  hundreds of idiots that have called for violence so they could bust anytime they
[03:40:48.080 --> 03:40:52.800]  want it and I said they've got all their people marked that they're gonna set up
[03:40:52.800 --> 03:40:59.640]  people they've sold guns to sawed-off shotguns whatever the case is before they
[03:40:59.640 --> 03:41:03.440]  start trying to push a domestic purge operation that's meant for the general
[03:41:03.440 --> 03:41:07.240]  public they're gonna pick out groups to set the precedent like Ruby Ridge and
[03:41:07.240 --> 03:41:13.680]  then wake up and then Oklahoma City so I see all this hype from Republicans
[03:41:13.680 --> 03:41:20.320]  Democrats Fox CNN MSNBC the tea partiers have radicals in them the 9-11
[03:41:20.320 --> 03:41:23.600]  truthers and the birthers with his birth certificate they're gonna get violent
[03:41:23.600 --> 03:41:27.800]  and then Joe Stack happened clearly staged the Pentagon shooting totally
[03:41:27.800 --> 03:41:31.440]  staged the underwear bombing totally staged and we've done whole shows on
[03:41:31.440 --> 03:41:35.160]  those they're archived at prison planet dot TV of your new listener you know the
[03:41:35.160 --> 03:41:39.440]  FBI and State Department being ordered to let the underwear bomber on protecting
[03:41:39.440 --> 03:41:42.640]  him getting him on for a month they said Kurt Haskell and other witnesses
[03:41:42.640 --> 03:41:45.200]  were lying on the plane then it was admitted to be true I can go over the
[03:41:45.200 --> 03:41:49.600]  abyss but we'll run out of time here top Homeland Security official in remote
[03:41:49.600 --> 03:41:55.480]  control aircraft Joe Stack involved with black ops controlling the tiny hangar
[03:41:55.480 --> 03:41:59.320]  that held five aircraft in it just people witnesses saying that the the
[03:41:59.320 --> 03:42:02.920]  emergency crews were already on site before the IRS kamikaze attack what
[03:42:02.920 --> 03:42:06.120]  multiple witnesses who were later proven to be right about the emergency crews
[03:42:06.120 --> 03:42:09.120]  already being there later they had to admit all the biggest drill ever in
[03:42:09.120 --> 03:42:12.600]  town the parking lot next to it the hour before and they were there when
[03:42:12.600 --> 03:42:17.640]  it happened the FBI out there as the attack happened witnesses all saying
[03:42:17.640 --> 03:42:21.960]  that multiple witnesses that no one was in the plane again if I went over all
[03:42:21.960 --> 03:42:26.360]  the evidence the guy on psychotropic drugs tied in with Homeland Security and
[03:42:26.360 --> 03:42:32.560]  patents disappears for two months at the Pentagon got his gun out of the same
[03:42:32.560 --> 03:42:36.840]  Tennessee police lockup that the guy that shot up the federal courthouse got his
[03:42:36.840 --> 03:42:42.280]  gun from that's associated press on and on and on I mean I again I could spend
[03:42:42.280 --> 03:42:48.920]  three hours four hours on one of these subjects and we have I'm digressing here
[03:42:48.920 --> 03:42:53.680]  what I'm trying to say is this I saw the massive hype I know that everything
[03:42:53.680 --> 03:42:56.800]  they're doing is unconstitutional and politically unpopular they want to
[03:42:56.800 --> 03:43:00.200]  spin it around with violence they want to hype violence to get weak-minded
[03:43:00.200 --> 03:43:04.440]  copycats to go through to go through a bricks through windows or shoot into a
[03:43:04.440 --> 03:43:10.160]  congressman's office then they hype that up some real nuts may then do it that's
[03:43:10.160 --> 03:43:13.160]  why the congressman they got his office shot at in Virginia came out and said
[03:43:13.160 --> 03:43:16.680]  please stop hyping this you know in real terrorism you're not supposed to hype
[03:43:16.680 --> 03:43:19.640]  it that's why when they have fake terror they always hype it there's been a lot
[03:43:19.640 --> 03:43:22.520]  of real terror attacks in the world by the way in my research that they never
[03:43:22.520 --> 03:43:28.520]  talk about see there been some real terror attacks but then if the real they
[03:43:28.520 --> 03:43:33.480]  don't talk about them you understand that that's a rule that they have an
[03:43:33.480 --> 03:43:37.240]  actual government handbooks that don't hype terror because that feeds into what
[03:43:37.240 --> 03:43:40.000]  they want well then why are they hyping it because when they are the terrorists
[03:43:40.000 --> 03:43:45.120]  they hype it so I've been clear on this and we've had provocateurs trying to set
[03:43:45.120 --> 03:43:51.880]  us up trying to do it in the message boards calling here following us around
[03:43:51.880 --> 03:43:56.000]  going to events asking us if we want to be violent and if you're ever just
[03:43:56.000 --> 03:44:01.080]  halfway not paying attention and go oh yeah sure boom you'll be arrested it'll
[03:44:01.080 --> 03:44:04.640]  all be you know it'll be all over the news you're a terrorist so this is how
[03:44:04.640 --> 03:44:08.520]  they demonize any political opposition is by staging attacks and it's
[03:44:08.520 --> 03:44:14.120]  government's favorite thing to do give me a document cam shot please boys thank
[03:44:14.120 --> 03:44:19.240]  you here is a story here out of AOL news suspected militiamen charged with
[03:44:19.240 --> 03:44:23.640]  plotting to kill officers so now it's suspected militiamen like just being a
[03:44:23.640 --> 03:44:27.600]  suspect of being someone armed like civil defense single protector community
[03:44:27.600 --> 03:44:31.040]  and supposedly they thought it was the end times they're mad at all the Muslims
[03:44:31.040 --> 03:44:38.680]  moving in to Michigan on and on and on and they raided a bunch of their houses
[03:44:38.680 --> 03:44:44.200]  here's another one indictment militia members sought to levy war against us
[03:44:44.200 --> 03:44:50.800]  and remember Muslim group of teens were supposed to wage war in Toronto turned
[03:44:50.800 --> 03:44:53.560]  out a provocateur was leading him and mailed him a memorandum nitrate they
[03:44:53.560 --> 03:45:01.600]  didn't even ask for remember in 2006 in Miami they went and found what was it
[03:45:01.600 --> 03:45:05.960]  11 and six of them were registered with the city on welfare as mentally
[03:45:05.960 --> 03:45:11.120]  retarded street kids who were rastafarian pothead Christians and gave them
[03:45:11.120 --> 03:45:14.680]  hundreds of thousands of dollars over a year and a half period to just talk
[03:45:14.680 --> 03:45:19.120]  about violence to to agree to wear military fatigues to videotape the FBI
[03:45:19.120 --> 03:45:25.200]  building in Miami and there was a case last week and it was a headline in the
[03:45:25.200 --> 03:45:32.600]  New York Post that government led the Muslim group set it up 1993 the FBI
[03:45:32.600 --> 03:45:36.200]  cooked the bomb trained the driver and then told him odd salon the guy they
[03:45:36.200 --> 03:45:40.160]  hired from Egypt a CIA asset to go ahead and go and have the bombing he knew
[03:45:40.160 --> 03:45:44.920]  they were setting him up and recorded the FBI top level people in eight hours of
[03:45:44.920 --> 03:45:47.680]  tapes saying yeah we're gonna let the bombing go ahead and he says well wait
[03:45:47.680 --> 03:45:51.120]  a minute are you trying to set me up for this first it was gonna be a dummy
[03:45:51.120 --> 03:45:54.480]  bomb then you said it had to be a real bomb for court now you're saying let it
[03:45:54.480 --> 03:45:58.760]  go forward I've got receipts I've got witnesses you're not gonna frame me for
[03:45:58.760 --> 03:46:01.800]  this Jason Bermas's new film they just released these tapes last year they've
[03:46:01.800 --> 03:46:05.240]  been in the New York Times in 93 and CBS News that this happened now we have the
[03:46:05.240 --> 03:46:09.680]  tapes they've been declassified and we're gonna he just plays a few clips of it in
[03:46:09.680 --> 03:46:15.640]  the film the point is is that there are mentally ill people I mean if I wanted to
[03:46:15.640 --> 03:46:18.320]  I'm not saying they'll take it out of context I'm not saying I would do this
[03:46:18.320 --> 03:46:23.480]  hypothetically you or anybody else could go to downtown Austin or downtown
[03:46:23.480 --> 03:46:26.960]  Chicago or downtown San Francisco or every got a bunch of homeless people we
[03:46:26.960 --> 03:46:30.560]  have a lot of them here in Austin I could find a drunken schizophrenic who
[03:46:30.560 --> 03:46:34.600]  believes they're Jesus I mean or a man dresses a woman or whatever I wanted to
[03:46:34.600 --> 03:46:39.040]  do and if I offered them $100,000 they dress up military fatigues and sit in
[03:46:39.040 --> 03:46:43.600]  front of a camera and say they were gonna blow things up and that's all they
[03:46:43.600 --> 03:46:47.560]  do I mean in every case these are schizophrenics mentally ill people
[03:46:47.560 --> 03:46:50.760]  mentally retarded people
[03:46:52.160 --> 03:46:58.000]  Bum Steer Award first place it's an attack they do every year and in Texas
[03:46:58.000 --> 03:47:04.520]  Monthly 1998 the Ku Klux Klan there was no Ku Klux Klan for him to find in
[03:47:04.520 --> 03:47:08.160]  Fort Worth they went and found a trailer part of complete alcoholics on
[03:47:08.160 --> 03:47:11.320]  welfare who didn't work for over two years they tried to get them to build
[03:47:11.320 --> 03:47:16.720]  bombs the FBI guy would get black powder and sell give you another 10,000 for
[03:47:16.720 --> 03:47:19.800]  liquor if you'll if you'll light it on camera for me in the backyard they're
[03:47:19.800 --> 03:47:24.840]  like we're gonna take over America we're gonna get you know and it came out it
[03:47:24.840 --> 03:47:28.760]  was all I mean it folks literally hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and
[03:47:28.760 --> 03:47:35.680]  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of cases of this and so this is what they
[03:47:35.680 --> 03:47:40.200]  do over and over and over again they'll go get meth heads in Colorado remember
[03:47:40.200 --> 03:47:44.880]  2008 and tell them I'll sell you all this meth but here use some cocaine and
[03:47:44.880 --> 03:47:48.280]  drink a bunch of whiskey we ought to take over you I don't like the government
[03:47:48.280 --> 03:47:53.280]  yeah we ought to go after Obama when he's here in town boom on the news I mean
[03:47:53.280 --> 03:47:59.520]  it's always the same MO you can go to any dive bar packed full of drunks on
[03:47:59.520 --> 03:48:02.880]  Saturday night and find somebody to shoot their mouth off but the point is
[03:48:02.880 --> 03:48:08.960]  here's the key they're bringing all this out now raids in four some are saying
[03:48:08.960 --> 03:48:17.720]  five states busting people trying to pin any Tea Party violence on conservatives
[03:48:17.720 --> 03:48:20.720]  on militias look at the mic report Homeland Security report that police
[03:48:20.720 --> 03:48:24.840]  gave us last year their main focus is you the the Americans that know what's
[03:48:24.840 --> 03:48:28.200]  going on and you went along with this Homeland Security grid because all
[03:48:28.200 --> 03:48:31.720]  that's for them Muslims with turbines on their head glass parking lot of torture
[03:48:31.720 --> 03:48:37.800]  room get them we don't need any Bill of Rights or Constitution we don't need
[03:48:37.800 --> 03:48:43.080]  any of that around here would you say you won't terrorists have rights boy now
[03:48:43.080 --> 03:48:45.680]  they've got all this legislation they've passed much of it saying they can
[03:48:45.680 --> 03:48:48.680]  arrest citizens for no reason and use enhanced irrigation and you're never
[03:48:48.680 --> 03:48:52.160]  seen again had Napolitano on Judge Napolitano covering it last Friday
[03:48:52.160 --> 03:48:55.720]  not just Alex Jones saying it reading the bill he said it's the most draconian
[03:48:55.720 --> 03:48:58.960]  thing ever seen even the Nazis didn't do this stuff on paper they just did it
[03:48:58.960 --> 03:49:07.800]  secretly it's all for you don't you get it it's all for you don't you understand
[03:49:07.800 --> 03:49:12.520]  that and so they're hyping all of this how many months three months I've been
[03:49:12.520 --> 03:49:17.200]  predicting that's all the signs and now I'm more sure than ever mid-April late
[03:49:17.200 --> 03:49:20.520]  April lots of little events to introduce the idea of oh there's these
[03:49:20.520 --> 03:49:23.640]  militias there's these conservatives there's these libertarians there's these
[03:49:23.640 --> 03:49:28.920]  gun owners they're out there they're bad they're evil something's gonna have
[03:49:28.920 --> 03:49:32.720]  it and then oh my gosh that's priming the pump it's like a choke and you're
[03:49:32.720 --> 03:49:36.000]  trying to start your four-wheeler and or your boat it's not starting and you got
[03:49:36.000 --> 03:49:41.040]  to pull that choke up get a little bit of fuel in there and then you know get
[03:49:41.040 --> 03:49:43.960]  that sucker going so they're they're priming the pump they're getting a
[03:49:43.960 --> 03:49:48.480]  little gasoline in there and those injectors they don't want to flood it
[03:49:48.480 --> 03:49:52.840]  because that might that might get you know people to get their ears up to get
[03:49:52.840 --> 03:49:56.920]  their eyes open they're you know enough fear and oh they're gonna hit no it's
[03:49:56.920 --> 03:50:01.920]  gonna happen and oh my god and they're gonna target some facility some federal

[03:56:12.040 --> 03:56:14.920]  hour have been blamed on the female suicide bombers oh we got to have chest
[03:56:14.920 --> 03:56:19.000]  x-rays now but previous instances of terrorism in Russia were proven to be
[03:56:19.000 --> 03:56:22.800]  the work of the FSB security service itself first explosion took place on a
[03:56:22.800 --> 03:56:26.640]  train after it had stopped at the station in central Moscow close to the
[03:56:26.640 --> 03:56:30.320]  headquarters of the Russian FSB security service a spokeswoman for the Russian
[03:56:30.320 --> 03:56:35.600]  emergencies ministry told AFP oh they were attacked like Northwoods calls for
[03:56:35.600 --> 03:56:40.080]  attacking themselves the first blast at the metro station killed 22 people and

[03:56:49.360 --> 03:56:54.680]  security service chief Alexander Bortnikov believe I pronounced that right
[03:56:54.680 --> 03:56:59.560]  is already blamed Chechen rebels for the attack an explanation slavishly accepted
[03:56:59.560 --> 03:57:04.160]  by Western media outlets like the BBC who are already running feature articles
[03:57:04.160 --> 03:57:07.520]  about the history of terrorism in Russia that completely fall in line with the
[03:57:07.520 --> 03:57:12.320]  FSB's direct role and completely failed to mention the FSB's direct role in
[03:57:12.320 --> 03:57:17.840]  almost every major attack to have ever taken place of the last 10 plus years
[03:57:17.840 --> 03:57:22.400]  since the explanation of the two female suicide bombers with explosives strapped
[03:57:22.400 --> 03:57:26.160]  their bodies were responsible for the bombing has come directly from FSB past
[03:57:26.160 --> 03:57:29.800]  history means we can only treat this official story with the utmost
[03:57:29.800 --> 03:57:34.040]  suspicion notorious Russian FSB has a documented history of staging false
[03:57:34.040 --> 03:57:38.600]  flag events in order to accomplish political agendas Vladimir Putin came to
[03:57:38.600 --> 03:57:42.560]  power as a result of an FSB orchestrated reign of terror in the autumn of 99 which
[03:57:42.560 --> 03:57:46.520]  involved blowing up apartment blocks all over Russia and blaming the attacks on
[03:57:46.520 --> 03:57:50.880]  Chechen separatists allowing Putin to start a war and secure victory in the
[03:57:50.880 --> 03:57:55.400]  presidential election FSB agents were caught planting hexogen explosives
[03:57:55.400 --> 03:58:00.920]  underneath an apartment block in Ryzen records indicated the first call the
[03:58:00.920 --> 03:58:05.240]  terrorists made after planting the bomb was to FSB headquarters and the culprits
[03:58:05.240 --> 03:58:08.200]  were allowed to flee the country by authorities and it goes on from there
