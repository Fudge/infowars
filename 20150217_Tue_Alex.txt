[00:00.000 --> 00:04.640]  And if you're not with them cops in military, then you will declare that you're with the
[00:04.640 --> 00:05.640]  Republic now.
[00:05.640 --> 00:10.360]  I am a former Los Angeles police narcotics detective and I work south-central Los Angeles
[00:10.360 --> 00:13.920]  and I will tell you, Director Deutsch, that the agency has dealt drugs throughout this
[00:13.920 --> 00:16.080]  country for a long time.
[00:16.080 --> 00:22.960]  Mr. Webb, I was wondering if you have ever gotten a chance to look into the rumors and
[00:22.960 --> 00:27.960]  reports that Amina Arkansas was a major drug trans shipment center during the 80s.
[00:27.960 --> 00:31.960]  Those people that don't know, there was a major drug trafficker named Barry Seal who
[00:31.960 --> 00:36.160]  was based his air fleet at Mina, which is a tiny little airport up in the mountains
[00:36.160 --> 00:38.160]  of Arkansas.
[00:38.160 --> 00:41.960]  Russell Welch, criminal investigator for the Arkansas State Police.
[00:41.960 --> 00:44.960]  Did Barry Seal ever say to you, I work for the CIA?
[00:44.960 --> 00:47.960]  He said he was working, had worked for the CIA.
[00:47.960 --> 00:51.960]  Unit 5 is learned in the early 1980s, even before his arrest.
[00:51.960 --> 00:55.960]  Seal had bought one of his planes from a CIA front, Air America.
[00:55.960 --> 01:00.960]  The plane was used by Seal for drug smuggling and the CIA company was paid in the traditional
[01:00.960 --> 01:04.960]  drug dealer fashion of $300,000 in cash.
[01:04.960 --> 01:09.960]  Last night on Louisiana, Barry Seal's enemies caught up with him and killed him.
[01:09.960 --> 01:11.960]  Tonight, three men are in custody.
[01:11.960 --> 01:18.960]  NBC's Brian Ross reports that Seal was about to testify for the government once again.
[01:18.960 --> 01:20.960]  Well, how do you think the crack rock gets into the country?
[01:20.960 --> 01:22.960]  We don't own any planes.
[01:22.960 --> 01:24.960]  We don't own no ships.
[01:24.960 --> 01:28.960]  We are not the people who are flying and floating it in here.
[01:28.960 --> 01:31.960]  Back when this all first came out, people didn't believe the CIA was bringing drugs out.
[01:31.960 --> 01:32.960]  I didn't believe it.
[01:32.960 --> 01:37.960]  Even when Gary reported the story and I was like, this guy, Gary, what is he talking about?
[01:37.960 --> 01:40.960]  I was involved with the CIA in no way.
[01:40.960 --> 01:45.960]  It wasn't until the CIA themselves put out their report.
[01:45.960 --> 01:50.960]  I mean, that was when it really hit me that, hey, Gary was right.
[01:50.960 --> 01:59.960]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[02:06.960 --> 02:09.960]  Joe Biggs here with infowars.com with some breaking news out of Japan.
[02:09.960 --> 02:17.960]  Now at 8.06 their time, a 6.9 magnitude earthquake went off the coast and now they are warning people to evacuate.
[02:17.960 --> 02:29.960]  We have breaking news for you. A magnitude 6.9 earthquake struck off the coast of Iwate prefecture in northeastern Japan at 8.06 Japan time on Tuesday.
[02:29.960 --> 02:34.960]  The Japan Meteorological Agency is warning of a one meter tsunami.
[02:34.960 --> 02:38.960]  This happened in Iwate. It was just north of Fukushima.
[02:38.960 --> 02:44.960]  People are warning all the residents along the coast to evacuate, get to higher ground immediately.
[02:44.960 --> 02:51.960]  Anyone in that area should listen to local authorities and disaster management officials for information and instructions.
[02:51.960 --> 03:00.960]  JMA is calling on people in the area where the tsunami advisory is issued to leave coastal areas or riversides immediately.
[03:00.960 --> 03:03.960]  They're expecting a tsunami to hit there anytime.
[03:03.960 --> 03:07.960]  This is huge, so continue to look for updates as this happens.
[03:07.960 --> 03:14.960]  This is a developing story and our hearts and prayers go out to the people in that area that could be affected by this huge tsunami.
[03:18.960 --> 03:20.960]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:20.960 --> 03:25.960]  We're going to break right now and launch the full transmission at Dr. Group Institute today.
[03:25.960 --> 03:28.960]  Tons of vital news across the board.
[03:28.960 --> 03:35.960]  Again, I'm your host Alex Jones on this Tuesday, 17th day of February 2015 worldwide global transmission.
[03:35.960 --> 03:43.960]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[03:53.960 --> 03:55.960]  You don't have to be a doctor to know.

[04:36.960 --> 04:40.960]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[04:40.960 --> 04:44.960]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[04:44.960 --> 04:46.960]  Can you put two and two together?
[04:46.960 --> 04:51.960]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds.
[04:51.960 --> 05:01.960]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal, but for how long? Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L Body Armor.com.
[05:01.960 --> 05:23.960]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[05:32.960 --> 05:39.960]  The Month of February is all about Valentine's Day.
[05:39.960 --> 05:43.960]  Big heart-shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[05:43.960 --> 05:49.960]  What if we the Patriots hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment?
[05:49.960 --> 05:54.960]  I'm all about human potential. I'm all about the individual being empowered. The establishment is the opposite.
[05:54.960 --> 05:59.960]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride and GMO, estrogen mimickers and the rest of the garbage.
[05:59.960 --> 06:03.960]  Info Wars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.
[06:03.960 --> 06:08.960]  How we can come together and win the human race and celebrate the kickoff of Human Empowerment Month.
[06:08.960 --> 06:14.960]  We're slashing prices on InfoWarsLife.com products like Super Male and Super Female Vitality.
[06:14.960 --> 06:21.960]  The sale is only running for the month, 20% off, and there's a lot of other powerful specials at InfoWarsLife.com.

[06:30.960 --> 06:54.960]  Again, InfoWarsLife.com or triple-eight to five three three one three nine.
[06:54.960 --> 07:04.960]  I'll take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance. It's Alex Jones.
[07:04.960 --> 07:12.960]  We're live. It's the 17th day, ladies and gentlemen of February, 2015 on this Tuesday edition.
[07:12.960 --> 07:17.960]  Are you a patriot or are you a globalist masquerading as a patriot?
[07:17.960 --> 07:29.960]  Do you want to kill Nazis?
[07:29.960 --> 07:37.960]  I don't want to kill anyone. I don't like bullies. I don't care where they're from.
[07:37.960 --> 07:44.960]  I believe Captain America was a composite character that really kind of captured the essence of that generation.
[07:44.960 --> 07:53.960]  There's another analogy to be taken from Captain America, and that is that that generation and America in general has essentially fallen asleep like Captain America did
[07:53.960 --> 08:00.960]  as you see him wake up in the second Captain America movie to find that he's living in an authoritarian police state.
[08:00.960 --> 08:08.960]  For a second day in a row, a group of World War II vets literally took down a barrier blocking off the World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C.
[08:08.960 --> 08:15.960]  He needs his barricades back. Well, you seem pretty chipper for someone who just found out they died for nothing.
[08:15.960 --> 08:30.960]  I go protect Iraqis and Iraq, and I come back and I find that my fellow Americans are being attacked by police.
[08:30.960 --> 08:36.960]  For once, we're way ahead of the curve. By holding a gun to everyone on Earth, you're calling it protection.
[08:36.960 --> 08:44.960]  It's a national guard going street by street, house to house, and instructions to disarm anyone inside.
[08:44.960 --> 08:48.960]  We're going to neutralize a lot of threats before they even happen.
[08:48.960 --> 08:50.960]  The punishment usually came after the crime.
[08:50.960 --> 08:57.960]  And when they say, I want my lawyer, you tell them, shut up. You're timing to get a lawyer. You're an enemy combat.
[08:57.960 --> 08:59.960]  Yes, there's some nasty stuff.
[08:59.960 --> 09:03.960]  Yeah, we compromised, sometimes in ways that made us not sleep so well.
[09:03.960 --> 09:06.960]  When I was in Afghanistan, they usually kept us outside these buildings.
[09:06.960 --> 09:12.960]  And the other government agency guys, probably like DEA, CIA and all of that, they would go into these kind of rooms like that, exactly.
[09:12.960 --> 09:15.960]  And they would be torturing people from in there.
[09:15.960 --> 09:18.960]  Horrible scream to hear a grown person like that being tortured.
[09:18.960 --> 09:22.960]  You're watching as this opium is being grown. We provide them security.
[09:22.960 --> 09:25.960]  We're providing them resources, and we're providing them alternatives.
[09:25.960 --> 09:28.960]  Captain America is a fugitive from SHIELD.
[09:28.960 --> 09:32.960]  With all due respect, if SHIELD is conducting a manhunt for Captain America, we deserve to know why.
[09:32.960 --> 09:40.960]  You have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[09:40.960 --> 09:45.960]  This is only going to get worse once it starts. And again, there's no veterans doing anything right now.
[09:45.960 --> 09:50.960]  No IEDs. They are literally getting the police to pick a fight with veterans.
[09:50.960 --> 09:54.960]  You are standing in my brain.
[09:54.960 --> 09:55.960]  How did you get here?
[09:55.960 --> 09:57.960]  Invited.
[09:57.960 --> 10:04.960]  This operation paperclip after World War II, SHIELD recruited German scientists with strategic values.
[10:04.960 --> 10:06.960]  It's all like what happens at war.
[10:06.960 --> 10:13.960]  Operation paperclip explores the secret military program that hired scientists who used slave labor to build the V2 rocket,
[10:13.960 --> 10:17.960]  and others who used concentration camp victims for human experiments.
[10:17.960 --> 10:23.960]  The responsibility for the staggering loss of life and property is uniformly placed on Hitler and the Nazis,
[10:23.960 --> 10:32.960]  and excluded from the official history is the fact that Hitler and the National Socialists would not have risen to power without the help of international bankers
[10:32.960 --> 10:35.960]  and American and German corporations.
[10:35.960 --> 10:39.960]  She's disabling security protocols and dumping all the secrets onto the internet.
[10:39.960 --> 10:40.960]  Including hydras.
[10:40.960 --> 10:41.960]  And SHIELDS.
[10:41.960 --> 10:43.960]  What about Bradley Manning?
[10:43.960 --> 10:45.960]  What about Bradley Manning?
[10:45.960 --> 10:47.960]  Betrayed.
[10:47.960 --> 10:53.960]  I think the revelations are terrible because they were revealed.
[10:53.960 --> 10:54.960]  What's his name?
[10:54.960 --> 10:55.960]  Snowden.
[10:55.960 --> 10:56.960]  Yes, Snowden.
[10:56.960 --> 10:58.960]  I think he's a traitor.
[10:58.960 --> 11:00.960]  What about the others?
[11:00.960 --> 11:01.960]  Are you planning a rescue mission?
[11:01.960 --> 11:05.960]  You think about what is going on with the Veterans Administration, the hospital,
[11:05.960 --> 11:08.960]  and the fact that we have veterans that are dying because they're on a wait list.
[11:08.960 --> 11:11.960]  We talk about Sergeant Tamarisi and his situation.
[11:11.960 --> 11:13.960]  You don't need to know that.
[11:13.960 --> 11:19.960]  Persia!
[11:19.960 --> 11:24.960]  Something that I've been upset about and raised in pain about, and so I'm going to ask you about it.
[11:24.960 --> 11:32.960]  And that's this right wing extremism report that was mailed out to all law enforcement officials from the United States.
[11:32.960 --> 11:34.960]  I apologize for that report.
[11:34.960 --> 11:36.960]  It was not authorized to be distributed.
[11:36.960 --> 11:38.960]  This is a freedom.
[11:38.960 --> 11:39.960]  This is fear.
[11:39.960 --> 11:42.960]  SHIELDS takes the world as it is, not as we'd like it to be.
[11:42.960 --> 11:47.960]  It's been damned the past time you get to live that program, Captain.
[11:47.960 --> 11:49.960]  Don't hold your breath.
[11:49.960 --> 11:54.960]  Rallieging Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[11:54.960 --> 11:56.960]  It's Alex Jones.
[12:03.960 --> 12:09.960]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live Tuesday edition.
[12:09.960 --> 12:12.960]  We've just played that Captain America intro.
[12:12.960 --> 12:16.960]  And no, I don't believe the New World Order conspiracy is a Nazi conspiracy.
[12:16.960 --> 12:27.960]  But I do know that the Nazi conspiracy was part of the globalist eugenicist larger tree, larger program.
[12:27.960 --> 12:38.960]  And that's why what we see with the black uniforms and the checkpoints and the surveillance and the political manipulation is so similar to the Nazis on so many fronts
[12:38.960 --> 12:49.960]  that came out of those sciences of social control developed in Europe, the United States and England, as well as Russia in the last two centuries.
[12:49.960 --> 13:04.960]  We also see a lot of parallels with Soviet and communist oppression because the very same robber barons that finance both Bolshevik communism and Naziism
[13:04.960 --> 13:15.960]  control of much of the planet today and are busy mopping up countries that they don't control or haven't overthrown yet,
[13:15.960 --> 13:23.960]  and are busy trying to mop up the freedoms, the vestigial freedoms, the ceremonial freedoms that are still left.
[13:23.960 --> 13:29.960]  Compartmentalization is what allows the social engineers to get away with this.
[13:29.960 --> 13:41.960]  But at the same time, it's compartmentalization that really never allows the globalist to get their full plan in place because their own people aren't usually evil.
[13:41.960 --> 13:45.960]  They're just ignorant of the larger program that they're part of.
[13:45.960 --> 14:02.960]  The problem is with computers and centralization, it allows total micromanagement of police, military, and the constabulary, the so-called security services, as well as the media services and the bureaucracy,
[14:02.960 --> 14:16.960]  so that you can basically get a Tomaton robot level submission and take free will and human judgment out of the equation.
[14:16.960 --> 14:26.960]  So before they bring in the robots and the computers to replace humans, they're using robot computers, surveillance smart grids,
[14:26.960 --> 14:35.960]  to control and socially engineer humans to become biological androids in our own right.
[14:35.960 --> 14:42.960]  So it's not even so much that we're going to be defeated or overtaken by machines as that we are going to become machines,
[14:42.960 --> 14:49.960]  and that's what every establishment wonk from Ray Kurzweil right down the line says the plan is.
[14:49.960 --> 14:57.960]  So when we talk about this, this is not Alex Jones up here with some foggy notion of what I believe is coming. That's what's so frustrating.
[14:57.960 --> 15:05.960]  95% of this or more, almost said 98, but it's more like 95% of this plan is public.
[15:05.960 --> 15:16.960]  It's all standardized. It's all being rolled out. It's just the public and the police and the military and the bureaucracy is told it's all being done for one cover story reason
[15:16.960 --> 15:26.960]  when it's got a whole nother reason behind it. And you can go to the textbooks, the white papers, the different globalist publications,
[15:26.960 --> 15:33.960]  and you can see them saying that and bragging about their program.
[15:33.960 --> 15:41.960]  U.S. spy agency predicts a very transhuman future by 2030. That's only 15 years away, boys and girls.
[15:41.960 --> 15:46.960]  Remember when 2030 sounded like a million light years from us?
[15:46.960 --> 15:56.960]  And that's what the NSA and DARPA and the CIA are all saying because they're building that world and they're building a world that ends our free will.
[15:56.960 --> 16:01.960]  And that's my biggest issue with the globalist and their plan. I don't want wars.
[16:01.960 --> 16:07.960]  I don't want to try to be some Politico. I'm not up here trying to be a big shot.
[16:07.960 --> 16:19.960]  I'm up here trying to build the best, most focused platform I can to get humanity to have a debate and discussion about what's going on right now.
[16:19.960 --> 16:27.960]  I mean, look at that headline. DARPA's cortical modem will plug straight into your brain.
[16:27.960 --> 16:35.960]  Who needs tech specs when you could have a $10 HUD on your visual cortex?
[16:35.960 --> 16:51.960]  And this is where it's going. I've talked many times about I wish some cartoonist or someone should create a video, create a animation where it shows the birth of media.
[16:51.960 --> 16:58.960]  Stone tablets and basically then the printing press and things like that.
[16:58.960 --> 17:08.960]  And then accelerating up to telegraphs and then telephone and then radio. And suddenly everyone in the house is together around the radio.
[17:08.960 --> 17:18.960]  It's the center of the family now, not the father, not the mother, repeating the ancestral common sense knowledge on to their children.
[17:18.960 --> 17:22.960]  Now the radio is the center of the household, the center of our life.
[17:22.960 --> 17:30.960]  The first time a central system is able to program and suddenly it's not just the president saying a chicken in every pot.
[17:30.960 --> 17:35.960]  You're going to get everything free under socialism, FDR. Suddenly it's a television set.
[17:35.960 --> 17:42.960]  And now you're not at the dinner table at all. You're all facing the television looking straight at it, mesmerized.
[17:42.960 --> 17:51.960]  And then it's computers and then it's handheld computers and then it's Google glasses and Microsoft glasses and then it's contact lenses.
[17:51.960 --> 17:59.960]  And then it's a brain port. My uncle has epilepsy from motorcycle accident.
[17:59.960 --> 18:08.960]  He's got a port. He's got a chip and it helps him. He doesn't have seizures anymore. It's amazing.
[18:08.960 --> 18:13.960]  You don't have to take the medication anymore. So he's a different person.
[18:13.960 --> 18:19.960]  There's good things about this except there's a globalist tentacle of control and all of it.
[18:19.960 --> 18:26.960]  And they're bringing in a system that is meant to end our world as we know it in a very bad way.
[18:26.960 --> 18:36.960]  Unlimited omnipresent, almost, but on this planet, near omnipresent surveillance, but still in the hands of wicked men. Stay with us.

[19:42.960 --> 19:48.960]  What if we the Patriots hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment?
[19:48.960 --> 19:53.960]  I'm all about human potential. I'm all about the individual being empowered. The establishment is the opposite.

[22:54.960 --> 23:08.960]  I'm just here warning people about the stated globalist plan that guides the planet openly.
[23:08.960 --> 23:23.960]  It's so frustrating that it's in all these public statements and it's the guiding principle and there's just a bunch of arrogant, power-hungry mobsters and gangsters who are openly, arrogantly overthrowing common sense.
[23:23.960 --> 23:30.960]  I mean, look at all this news I've got. Let me just give you some headlines.
[23:30.960 --> 23:40.960]  Our rights do not come from God. That's the headline. In fact, let's play this clip of Governor Cuomo right now.
[23:40.960 --> 23:56.960]  Because our rights contained in the Bill of Rights do not come from the Constitution. They come from God. It's clearly stated in the Declaration of Independence.
[23:56.960 --> 24:01.960]  You would call it organic law as a basis for future laws off of it.
[24:01.960 --> 24:15.960]  I would call it the organic law because the United States Code calls it organic law. It is organic law because the law of this country calls it the organic law of our country means where our rights come from.
[24:15.960 --> 24:27.960]  Now, that's Cuomo's brother who's an anchor. I have another headline here with a quote and David Knight did a report on it where Cuomo made similar statements.
[24:27.960 --> 24:34.960]  It was Governor Cuomo that said, if you are a gut owner, believe in the Second Amendment or a pro-life, get out of the state.
[24:34.960 --> 24:40.960]  And the media a few days later said, do you want to clarify that? Are you serious? He said, yeah, I said get out.
[24:40.960 --> 24:48.960]  So this is the gangster-ish, arrogant, just over-the-top attitude of these people.
[24:48.960 --> 25:04.960]  Now, there's some goodness. Federal Judge stalls Obama's executive action on immigration. A Texas judge in South Texas yesterday temporarily blocked President Barack Obama's executive action, his tyrannical action, his dictatorial action,
[25:04.960 --> 25:11.960]  on immigration giving a coalition of 28 states time to pursue a lawsuit that aims to permanently stop the orders.
[25:11.960 --> 25:21.960]  Yeah. I mean, imagine if they said President George Washington decided to open these borders without Congress's approval. I mean, it's over-the-top.
[25:21.960 --> 25:32.960]  Over-the-top, over-the-top. There's just not words to describe how brazen this is and there's not that big an uproar except by supposedly right-wing racist media.
[25:32.960 --> 25:45.960]  You can't just—Nigeria doesn't have open borders. Mexico doesn't have open borders. You sure can't get there and be given free health care and tax refunds.
[25:45.960 --> 25:50.960]  And listen, it gets worse. I've known about this for years. But here's the headline today.
[25:50.960 --> 25:58.960]  Outraged, Border Patrol ordered to release all illegal alien drunk drivers, quote, the judge, allow them to go on their way.
[25:58.960 --> 26:03.960]  I've had Travis County prosecutors in my office showing me the transcripts.
[26:03.960 --> 26:09.960]  And we did reports on a few years ago. I couldn't use their names, of course, of where they're ordered to let aggravated felons go.
[26:09.960 --> 26:16.960]  I'm talking about arsonist and people. Of course, that's in the news, but it's just different when you're actually talking to the prosecutor.
[26:16.960 --> 26:21.960]  They will throw the book for a crooked toenail at you for anything.
[26:21.960 --> 26:28.960]  But if you're an illegal alien, you are above the law. I mean, it is just—it's like they're super people or something.
[26:28.960 --> 26:37.960]  They can just do whatever they want, have as many ideas as they want, and they're used by criminal groups, the Democratic Party, and others to launder money and as cutouts.
[26:37.960 --> 26:47.960]  That's why they're allowed to operate like this. They're allowed to get the tax refunds. Remember, two weeks ago it came out, oh, the illegals are going to be able to get tax refunds the day they get here.
[26:47.960 --> 27:01.960]  And there were articles years ago in the U.S.A. today where one home in Austin was like $86 million in tax refunds and no investigation, and 100-something million at one home in Atlanta.
[27:01.960 --> 27:09.960]  Billions and billions of dollars total, and they're allowed to do this because the FBI and others are told do not get involved.
[27:09.960 --> 27:16.960]  If you were caught driving while intoxicated and happened to be an American citizen, then you're going to be arrested, fined, and potentially jailed, and rightfully so.
[27:16.960 --> 27:27.960]  But driving under the influence of alcohol, drugs, you are putting the lives of others in danger when you drive on public roads, says Max Slavo, writing here in the article.
[27:27.960 --> 27:40.960]  But it goes on. But as we've come to learn in recent years, if you're an undocumented alien—ooh, you used the political correct term, an illegal alien—who has entered the country illegally, the laws don't apply to you.
[27:40.960 --> 27:53.960]  And not only do you get to break the law by entering the United States without authorization, but you also get free health care, housing, food, and tax refunds, even if you falsified your employment paperwork.
[27:53.960 --> 28:04.960]  And then Judicial Watch got the document—they got a link to it here—that directs the 4,000-plus U.S. Border Patrol agents and the Tucson Arizona sector to, quote, release individuals under the influence and allow them to go on their way.
[28:04.960 --> 28:22.960]  The document acknowledges that this feels counterintuitive, it goes on to order the Border Patrol, quote, therefore there is generally no liability that will attach to the agent or agency for failing to act on this situation and explains how they've been given a Homeland Security memo to basically have them be above the law.
[28:22.960 --> 28:27.960]  I mean, this is over the top, and it illustrates everything—a lawless criminal government.
[28:27.960 --> 28:36.960]  The Empire's on the run.
[28:57.960 --> 29:04.960]  In the month of February, with human empowerment month.

[29:36.960 --> 29:55.960]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health, introducing the new InfoWarsLife.com Oil of Oregano Formulation, a highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.

[30:58.960 --> 31:13.960]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo. At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[31:13.960 --> 31:23.960]  Can you put two and two together? Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced and fully legal.
[31:23.960 --> 31:35.960]  But for how long? Go to infidelbodyarmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L body armor dot com. Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[31:54.960 --> 32:04.960]  We're here, ladies and gentlemen, we're live. Is it not unspeakably insane?
[32:04.960 --> 32:13.960]  I want to go back into this issue of the illegals being above the law, that the illegals are released by the hundreds of thousands per year, according to federal documents,
[32:13.960 --> 32:24.960]  for things like aggravated assault, burglary with a weapon, arson, child molestation, you name it.
[32:24.960 --> 32:34.960]  And that's why all over the world, but particularly Latin America, because that's the group that's really protected, it's part of merging the countries into the super union.
[32:34.960 --> 32:44.960]  That's why you have all these serial killers and people fleeing coming here, they get a new identity, and then they are above the law.
[32:44.960 --> 32:53.960]  It is mind-blowing. And I was just reading from Judicial Watch.
[32:53.960 --> 33:01.960]  According to Judicial Watch, the Obama administration has ordered all Border Patrol agents to stop apprehending illegal aliens who have been detained for drunk driving.
[33:01.960 --> 33:09.960]  Yes, you read that correctly. Not only are illegal aliens being released and their violations of the US immigration law being ignored,
[33:09.960 --> 33:17.960]  but now, even if they are hammered, drunk, the Border Patrol has been advised to let them go on their way while under the influence.
[33:17.960 --> 33:21.960]  And I told the story and shot video of it in Big Bend last year.
[33:21.960 --> 33:36.960]  The illegals were coming across the border, and then vans were picking them up, and they were driving off, and the Border Patrol was there with the park rangers, armed police park rangers.
[33:36.960 --> 33:45.960]  And I was sitting there in a hot spring, a natural hot spring, with like five people throwing a football.
[33:45.960 --> 33:59.960]  And we heard a, and we turned around, and there was a police officer, park rangers, you know, two types, park rangers, and then the swarm ones with the guns.
[33:59.960 --> 34:11.960]  And I was like, what are you doing? We went, nothing. We paid admission of the park, we're there throwing a football to each other, and then just smiled and stared at us weird.
[34:11.960 --> 34:18.960]  And I was like, really, you're actually, and I want to explain something.
[34:18.960 --> 34:31.960]  150 feet across were illegals, and they were going back and forth and doing whatever they wanted, and they were riding over on horses and crapping right in front of the Border Patrol.
[34:31.960 --> 34:39.960]  In fact, I have video of it, of the horse going to the bathroom right by the Border Patrol, because this country is a joke.
[34:39.960 --> 34:45.960]  But they wanted me to know, and I'm not saying Border Patrol are bad, this was a park ranger.
[34:45.960 --> 35:00.960]  And I'm not saying all park rangers are bad, but there are some of the most arrogant, statistically, I've had more bizarre experiences with Border Patrol, I mean, with park rangers than with anybody else.
[35:00.960 --> 35:10.960]  Because they're mainly a bunch of fake anti-human environmentalists that are taught that humans are a problem, and it's a problem that you're at the National Park.
[35:10.960 --> 35:16.960]  It's a problem that you're there doing things. It's a problem that you're having a good time. It's a problem.
[35:16.960 --> 35:24.960]  We are now, if you're a TV viewer, showing the footage of the horse. Parental discretion is advised.
[35:24.960 --> 35:31.960]  It's a big sarcastic. We are showing video, but it's not really parental discretion advised, big deal, horse going to the bathroom.
[35:31.960 --> 35:37.960]  And you have to understand, right down the river were Border Patrol trucks sitting there.
[35:37.960 --> 35:42.960]  And then this guy just continues to go riding around anywhere he wants.
[35:42.960 --> 35:49.960]  And here we are, committing the supercrime of playing with the football.
[35:49.960 --> 35:54.960]  And right after I put my phone up, they asked, what are you doing? What do you think you're doing to the whole group?
[35:54.960 --> 35:57.960]  And we're just looking at each other like, what do you think we're doing?
[35:57.960 --> 36:06.960]  You know, there's a couple of women in bikinis in the springs, couple guys, I mean, and then I found them in the parking lot riding people tickets.
[36:06.960 --> 36:13.960]  They would look in people's ice coolers and would find beer and would give them tickets.
[36:13.960 --> 36:20.960]  But the illegal aliens are allowed to get hammered drunk and come across on their canoes and do whatever they want.
[36:20.960 --> 36:23.960]  And I'm not even against these poor illegals wanting a better life.
[36:23.960 --> 36:28.960]  If I was one of them, you could get free health care and you could drunk drive everywhere.
[36:28.960 --> 36:32.960]  If I was a criminal, you know, I could rob banks and not get in trouble, basically.
[36:32.960 --> 36:39.960]  I mean, it's getting to that level. And as this crime wave hits, it's, oh, give us more of your liberty, give us more of your freedom.
[36:39.960 --> 36:49.960]  Oh, the local police are going to spy on your cell phones now in your location to keep you safe. No, this is not to keep us safe.
[36:49.960 --> 36:59.960]  Obtained by judicial watch this week, the notice is titled enforcement options with alcohol impaired drivers and directs that 4,000 plus U.S.
[36:59.960 --> 37:08.960]  Border Patrol agents in the Tucson, Arizona sector to release individuals close quote under the influence and quote, allow them to go on their way.
[37:08.960 --> 37:11.960]  The document acknowledges that this feels counterintuitive.
[37:11.960 --> 37:17.960]  What training government to ignore law selectively, officially, that's the essence of tyranny.
[37:17.960 --> 37:29.960]  Continuing the document acknowledges that this feels counterintuitive for Border Patrol agents, but eases concerns by answering the hypothetical question for the officers who have sworn to uphold the law.
[37:29.960 --> 37:37.960]  If you allow this driver to continue down the road and they kill someone, aren't you liable? The answer is no. Folks, that is a lie.
[37:37.960 --> 37:47.960]  You are liable because you're sworn, but even if you were a citizen and consciously knew, you would then be aiding and abetting like a bartender giving somebody 10 drinks.
[37:47.960 --> 37:51.960]  Let me just read this though from the document itself. Okay, I mean, you cannot make this up.
[37:51.960 --> 38:02.960]  The document acknowledges that this feels counterintuitive for Border Patrol agents, but eases concerns by answering a hypothetical question for the officers who have sworn to uphold the law.
[38:02.960 --> 38:10.960]  If you allow this driver to continue down the road and they kill someone, aren't you liable? The answer is no.
[38:10.960 --> 38:22.960]  And two plus two does not equal four. I'm sorry, let me go back. According to the new Department of Homeland Security, DHS memo, there is no legal, I'm quoting, there is no legal requirement for Border Patrol agent to intervene in a state crime,
[38:22.960 --> 38:35.960]  including DUI, the order says, adding that therefore there is generally no liability that will attach to the agent or agency for failing to act in the situation.
[38:35.960 --> 38:43.960]  So they're claiming like you're the ATF. And well, they're not, you know, they're to investigate banks, bank robberies.
[38:43.960 --> 38:48.960]  They're just to investigate illegal guns or explosives or alcohol. They're revenuers. They're the original whiskey revenuers.
[38:48.960 --> 38:56.960]  Rather so nasty from the whiskey wards. One of the oldest federal agencies out there doing this stuff.
[38:56.960 --> 39:05.960]  That argument doesn't hold up here because they're sworn officers and if they see a crime being committed, they're supposed to then call locals to deal with it.
[39:05.960 --> 39:09.960]  If it's on federal land, they're supposed to take them to jail. That's what the law says. Everybody knows that.
[39:09.960 --> 39:19.960]  But beyond that, I have seen the Border Patrol writing tickets and putting people in handcuffs who weren't even drunk, American citizens.
[39:19.960 --> 39:32.960]  But because they were a bunch of UT alumni lawyers, that was funny enough, that's who they were arresting, in cowboy hats who had little containers, little ice chest of cursed light.
[39:32.960 --> 39:40.960]  Their only crime was that they weren't drinking real beer. Nothing against cursed light. It's just it is not real beer in my view.
[39:40.960 --> 39:44.960]  But you can drink your cursed light. I certainly liked it in college. It was cheap.
[39:44.960 --> 39:51.960]  The point is, I'll take a chameleon and drink beer. I like some Belgian ale. That issue.
[39:51.960 --> 39:58.960]  We're here looking at this. It's just crazy. And I remember my friends were there. Rob doing people were there.
[39:58.960 --> 40:03.960]  And I was getting really upset. And they said, well, let's get the cameras out. And I said, you know what? We're on a working vacation.
[40:03.960 --> 40:11.960]  We've already shot some reports. Let's go. Let's go hiking. We had our kids there, my son, his son.
[40:11.960 --> 40:19.960]  And we just, we just, Richard Reeves was there. We took the bus down. And I just said, fine. I just looked at those Border Patrol.
[40:19.960 --> 40:23.960]  Those people are just victims of evil. They'll have all their freedoms taken as well.
[40:23.960 --> 40:29.960]  When you can selectively, because this isn't new, this is just now officially in memos.
[40:29.960 --> 40:36.960]  Because even though the judge has cut them loose, Border Patrol, state police and local police just continue to arrest the illegals.
[40:36.960 --> 40:43.960]  And then their unions stand up for them a lot of times. The problem is now the unions have been threatened and infiltrated so they won't.
[40:43.960 --> 40:52.960]  And so the Travis County Sheriff, who's liberal, black, will every week, I think, I think this is three or three or five guys,
[40:52.960 --> 40:58.960]  search engine search engine Travis County Sheriff deportations.
[40:58.960 --> 41:07.960]  I want to say it's like three or five. I've seen different numbers. Sometimes as high as 15 people in a city of 2 million people, a county of 2 million people in the county.
[41:07.960 --> 41:15.960]  He's deported between three and 15 people. And they're all aggravated felons and the Democrats are trying to unseat him now.
[41:15.960 --> 41:22.960]  And he said it's the law. They're rapists. They're armed robbers.
[41:22.960 --> 41:28.960]  And he calls the feds down to the jail to get them. And the feds, by the way, all over the country will not show up to get the illegals.
[41:28.960 --> 41:33.960]  So this is a lawless, evil revolution against our country.
[41:33.960 --> 41:43.960]  It is totally unfair. It is total fraud. And it shows political correctness. I mean, they could pass Obamacare, doubling and tripling prices, death panels, written by insurance companies.
[41:43.960 --> 41:52.960]  Some insurance companies have doubled their profits. On average, they're up 47% globally. Global insurance companies just off the U.S. deal.
[41:52.960 --> 42:01.960]  So when you say double, that's mainly U.S. based ones have doubled or tripled some of them even more. In fact, don't believe me. Just search insurance company triples profits on Obamacare.
[42:01.960 --> 42:11.960]  I've seen those headlines. But worldwide, 47% increase in profits worldwide in the last year, just off the gang raping of the American people.
[42:11.960 --> 42:18.960]  And folks, it's going to get worse because we're wide open. We're submitting to tyranny. People are confused.
[42:18.960 --> 42:25.960]  They don't know what's going on. And so now it is wide open, ladies and gentlemen.
[42:25.960 --> 42:36.960]  There's the headline. It says that in the last six years, he's deported 5000 people.
[42:36.960 --> 42:41.960]  And I know he slowed down to almost nothing, but that's still almost nothing in a counting of 2 million.
[42:41.960 --> 42:47.960]  And now they're trying to get rid of him. And there's the headline, the sheriff's defense.
[42:47.960 --> 42:54.960]  Big national news stories. And then halfway down, they go, his defense for what he's doing. Oh, he's so horrible.
[42:54.960 --> 42:58.960]  Pretty soon it'll be, what's your defense for even pulling an illegal over?
[42:58.960 --> 43:01.960]  Well, they were driving down the wrong side of the road and hit three cars.
[43:01.960 --> 43:09.960]  That's a nice defense, racist. You racist black liberal Democrat. Everybody knows you're racist.
[43:09.960 --> 43:16.960]  But how many of these people that go along with this are going to get plowed by a drunk driver?
[43:16.960 --> 43:20.960]  You know, I love how people are getting arrested for having one glass of wine.
[43:20.960 --> 43:25.960]  They'll pull a housewife over. I don't care what color she is. She's an American citizen. Walk over, man, been ringing?
[43:25.960 --> 43:31.960]  Well, yeah, I did just go after work and have two glasses of wine. Well, I'm going to need you to step out here, little lady.
[43:31.960 --> 43:39.960]  You're going to have to spend about 10 grand paying this off over the next few years. Hope you enjoy it.
[43:39.960 --> 43:43.960]  And then the Austin American station, others ask, is Travis County immigrant friendly?
[43:43.960 --> 43:52.960]  Like, oh my gosh, is it trendy? And then investigation shows that this article says 19 people.
[43:52.960 --> 43:57.960]  This is a statesman, right? 19 of the Austin Chronicle.
[43:57.960 --> 44:06.960]  19 people are deported a week. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh.
[44:06.960 --> 44:11.960]  And we ranked number three in deportations because LA stopped. Houston's pretty much stopped.
[44:11.960 --> 44:21.960]  So, you know, for a southern city near the border, we're third. We should be third after like San Diego and San Antonio.
[44:21.960 --> 44:26.960]  How? I am so ashamed right now.
[44:26.960 --> 44:34.960]  He deports between three and 19, depending on what number you see a week of rapists and fellows.
[44:34.960 --> 44:39.960]  It's so horrible. Can you imagine how racists we are? We're so bad.
[44:39.960 --> 44:47.960]  Meanwhile, I go down to Mexico. If you go down to Mexico and you do anything wrong, in fact, forget anything wrong.
[44:47.960 --> 44:53.960]  The police will pull you over. Everybody knows this. It's happened to Nico in the control room.
[44:53.960 --> 44:58.960]  He's been shaken down by the police. And this happened when I was a kid with my parents.
[44:58.960 --> 45:03.960]  They didn't take us to jail, but they'll just keep getting more and more money from you and then go ahead and just take you to jail
[45:03.960 --> 45:08.960]  and then run a credit check on you, find out how much money you got and then suck 20, 30 grand out of you,
[45:08.960 --> 45:13.960]  beat you up while they're at it, rape your wife, take your kids away.
[45:13.960 --> 45:18.960]  And it's like, oh, how sweet. Oh, that's just Mexico. That's just what they do to us.
[45:18.960 --> 45:27.960]  We deserve it. We're America. We deserve double prices on Obamacare and death panels because the president's black and it's called Obamacare.
[45:27.960 --> 45:33.960]  And we deserve to turn our guns into because he's black and we're racist if we don't. I mean, it has nothing to do with anything.
[45:33.960 --> 45:46.960]  And we exposed back in June of last year, Don Salazar, Gari Jackson and our team on the border,
[45:46.960 --> 45:51.960]  that the illegals are put on buses and bused in with government vouchers to anywhere they want to go in the U.S.
[45:51.960 --> 45:59.960]  And we got the government head of McCallum to admit it on tape and the border patrol running around covering their faces up while they load the illegals.
[45:59.960 --> 46:05.960]  So if you're going to load the illegals, the shipment of the U.S., do you think you're going to let them off for drunk driving or then rape or whatever?
[46:05.960 --> 46:12.960]  You have to. You have to let them off on every level. But it's not discrimination that illegals are a protected superclass.
[46:12.960 --> 46:21.960]  People are mad at the police because there's a feeling that the police get away with stuff and are above the law. And they do.
[46:21.960 --> 46:30.960]  And part of that's because the police would collapse in this lawless country if they didn't get special treatment to a certain extent.
[46:30.960 --> 46:36.960]  And I'm not saying that's a good thing, but that comes out of the corruption. We're not an honorable country.
[46:36.960 --> 46:43.960]  We've killed 55 million of our own children in the last 41 years.
[46:43.960 --> 46:47.960]  We lied to ourselves about that. So of course, we're going to go into bondage.
[46:47.960 --> 46:54.960]  But people are rightfully mad that the cops turn off the dash cam and then meet you up and then charge you with assaulting them and don't know somebody's in the bushes videotaping.
[46:54.960 --> 46:59.960]  That kind of stuff's out today. And that bad cops get protected.
[46:59.960 --> 47:10.960]  But forget all that. What about 40, they now admit, 40 million illegal aliens in this country who get everything basically free and are above the law.
[47:10.960 --> 47:16.960]  And folks go, oh, but they're such hard workers. Yes, most of the illegals want to live high on the hug.
[47:16.960 --> 47:22.960]  And so they'll work and they pull welfare and it's well known more than half.
[47:22.960 --> 47:25.960]  You can pull statistics on that. My guys can do it right now.
[47:25.960 --> 47:28.960]  More than half the illegals are estimated to be getting social services.
[47:28.960 --> 47:35.960]  That's the highest rate out there above even inner city blacks half.
[47:35.960 --> 47:43.960]  And you see, once they're subsidized by government money, that'll drive down wages to a point where everybody's got to go on the welfare as a supplement.
[47:43.960 --> 47:52.960]  And now Walmart told their employees starting two years ago, we pay you low so that you could qualify for the assistance programs.
[47:52.960 --> 47:58.960]  That's how you enslave a once free country. That's how you domesticate them. That's how you take them down.
[47:58.960 --> 48:02.960]  And man, when I get pulled over by cops and they say, have you been drinking or what's in your car?
[48:02.960 --> 48:05.960]  I go, come on, man. I know you're told to let illegals go all day.
[48:05.960 --> 48:10.960]  And I've had state police three times the last four or five years ago. Yeah, you're right, Alex.
[48:10.960 --> 48:15.960]  They always know who I am. Suddenly they go, yeah, you're right. I know. I don't like it. I don't care.
[48:15.960 --> 48:20.960]  Get out of the car. I'm like, no, you're violating my rights right now.
[48:20.960 --> 48:24.960]  I don't care because once even though they know I'm right, they're like, I'm still going to show you.
[48:24.960 --> 48:27.960]  Yeah, I don't like that either. But you know what? I'm allowed to go after you.
[48:27.960 --> 48:32.960]  So I'm going to go after you is basically what they are doing in their actions.
[48:32.960 --> 48:40.960]  I was driving to work one morning about 930 out at the wide Oak Hill.
[48:40.960 --> 48:44.960]  And I was getting on the ramp probably going 65, but it's like 50 right there at the start.
[48:44.960 --> 48:50.960]  He gets me, pulls me over. I was taking my son to work that day.
[48:50.960 --> 48:55.960]  And he's just sitting there and he pulls me over and he's like been drinking.
[48:55.960 --> 49:00.960]  And I went at 930 in the morning. And I said, if I was any legal, you wouldn't even ask me that.
[49:00.960 --> 49:07.960]  That's true. And I got angry. And I just said, you go ahead and write me your ticket, man.
[49:07.960 --> 49:13.960]  But you're committing a crime every time you selectively gang rape America. I told him this.
[49:13.960 --> 49:20.960]  And that guy was so upset. Not even at me. He knew it was true. He was like, it's a joke, people.
[49:20.960 --> 49:23.960]  Our borders wide open. They put us in naked body scanners.
[49:23.960 --> 49:26.960]  And then I saw this years ago and it was admitted last year.
[49:26.960 --> 49:33.960]  Illegals get to fly with no IDs in and out of the country, but we, I mean, they are completely above the law.
[49:33.960 --> 49:37.960]  The whole government is criminal.
[49:37.960 --> 49:41.960]  This is Dan Pilla. Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay? Are tax debts crippling you?

[52:32.960 --> 52:45.960]  FakeTV.com
[53:03.960 --> 53:13.960]  Hey, you!
[53:13.960 --> 53:18.960]  We know you're under attack. We know that! We're talking to you today.
[53:18.960 --> 53:31.960]  Jumping to you with infowars.com. Now, a local Fox affiliate out of San Diego, Fox 5, accidentally depicts President Obama as a rape suspect in last night's 10 o'clock news.
[53:31.960 --> 53:36.960]  The only suspect in a sex assault at SDSU will not be charged.
[53:36.960 --> 53:44.960]  Maybe Fox actually got something right for once. Let's talk about all the different ways that President Obama has raped America.
[53:44.960 --> 53:52.960]  Is this news editing mistake a Freudian slip? Are we being gaslighted to subconsciously capitulate our awareness to the rapist and chief?
[53:52.960 --> 54:01.960]  Since taking office as the 44th president of the United States, President Barack Hussein Obama has forcibly violated what was left of our constitutional rights.
[54:01.960 --> 54:15.960]  The National Defense Authorization Act grants his office the power to deploy the U.S. military to apprehend and indefinitely detain any person, including American citizens, who he believes represent an enduring security threat to the United States.
[54:15.960 --> 54:23.960]  That's part of a report. You can see the full report. It's excellent that Joe Biggs filed at his desk.
[54:23.960 --> 54:31.960]  I love Joe because he does a lot of reporting for us, a lot of research, but he also comes up here sometimes at midnight and shoots reports at his desk.
[54:31.960 --> 54:36.960]  So let's give that guy a nice microphone in there. Let's give him a nice setup.
[54:36.960 --> 54:45.960]  I mean, let's give him an iPhone or something too, or he's got his own phone so he can start uploading stuff when he's out on the road. I mean, he's taken action. That's what I like to see.
[54:45.960 --> 54:54.960]  All the reporters are doing a great job. They do a great job in different ways, though. David Knight, Jakari Jackson, everybody.
[54:54.960 --> 55:02.960]  John Bowne, Lee Ann McAdoo, and I can't mention everybody. It really is amazing the job they're doing, covering all this.
[55:02.960 --> 55:16.960]  And the reason I want to play a little bit of that clip was this point. We are being raped and they are trying to train us like a pimp breaks his street hoe that we're lucky if we're even allowed to live, basically.
[55:16.960 --> 55:22.960]  And we're being beaten like a dog by this system.
[55:22.960 --> 55:34.960]  But there's going to be another reaction where more and more people who are American citizens are going to stop paying income tax to the private Federal Reserve through the IRS.
[55:34.960 --> 55:40.960]  People are going to stop paying for their tickets. They're going to stop paying for all the bureaucracy.
[55:40.960 --> 55:47.960]  And it's becoming a defense more and more in court with the judges that, hey, you let illegals go.
[55:47.960 --> 55:54.960]  So what we need to do is document the illegals being let go. Citizen journalists need to do this. Do it as like a month long project.
[55:54.960 --> 56:11.960]  We ought to have a contest for people legally and lawfully go, get transcripts, send it on the trials, watch the illegals released on $10 fines, what they're giving in Travis County, $10 fine for drunk driving, being released for hit and runs, being just cut loose for rape charges.
[56:11.960 --> 56:19.960]  We need to document that and then codify those as defense then when citizens have the book thrown against them.
[56:19.960 --> 56:29.960]  Because if a law is not justly appropriated and justly dealt out to the public, then it's null and void.
[56:29.960 --> 56:33.960]  Again, people are mad at cops because there's a sense that they're above the law.
[56:33.960 --> 56:41.960]  Well, if anybody's above the law, it's the illegal aliens. And I am incensed with the police for following orders and carrying out selective enforcement.
[56:41.960 --> 56:48.960]  I'm very mad at them as well and disgusted. I'm really disgusted with us for putting up with it. I'm disgusted with myself.
[56:48.960 --> 56:51.960]  I mean, I haven't talked about this in a while and it just makes me so angry.
[56:51.960 --> 56:58.960]  It's like, why aren't we doing more to fight this? And I'm really disgusted with the criminals that are running our government that are doing this in our face.
[56:58.960 --> 57:04.960]  I mean, that's who we blame is the globalist running the robber barons, the corrupt new world order.

[57:26.960 --> 57:35.960]  What disaster is so powerful? It unleashes a chain of mass pandemics, economic meltdowns and violent food riots all at the same time.
[57:35.960 --> 57:42.960]  NASA has already set the countdown timer and right now the 21st century apocalypse is less than 13 months away.
[57:42.960 --> 57:47.960]  Former CIA director James Woolsey says two-thirds of U.S. population could perish.
[57:47.960 --> 57:53.960]  In a matter of seconds, the world as we know it will cease to exist. The world's economy will be wiped out.

[58:47.960 --> 58:48.960]  You want answers?
[58:48.960 --> 58:50.960]  Well, so does he.
[58:50.960 --> 58:51.960]  He's Jakari Jones.
[58:51.960 --> 58:54.960]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[58:54.960 --> 58:56.960]  Alright, we're going to go to Jakari Jackson right now.
[58:56.960 --> 58:57.960]  We're live from Austin, Texas.
[58:57.960 --> 58:58.960]  Then we've got Alex Jones.
[58:58.960 --> 59:03.960]  Robert, he was sake, rich dad, poor dad joining us to get his view on the world economy.
[59:03.960 --> 59:07.960]  He was on about four years ago, made a lot of predictions. They did come true.
[59:07.960 --> 59:15.960]  And then we've got Dr. Everett Group with some huge breaking news on vaccines, you name it, and how to detox and more coming up in the third hour today.
[59:15.960 --> 59:20.960]  But I want to go to Jakari Jackson first there in the control room.
[59:20.960 --> 59:25.960]  Jakari is in there helping around the show today, not just doing a great job as a reporter and researcher.
[59:25.960 --> 59:35.960]  I want to get his tank on the judicial watch documents that we already knew because he was down there on the border and documented earlier last year.
[59:35.960 --> 59:43.960]  And the New York Times then picked it up later that the illegals were being loaded on buses by the feds and given vouchers and were ordered to cover it up.
[59:43.960 --> 59:50.960]  And again, the Border Patrol is the ones that leaked this to Jakari and to Kit Daniels so they could go down there with the Don Salazar and cover it.
[59:50.960 --> 59:53.960]  But it is pure discrimination. You talk about discrimination.
[59:53.960 --> 1:00:03.960]  I mean, the citizens get the book thrown at them for arson or rape and should, but DWI, but the illegals, they're telling them just, quote, let them go on their way.
[1:00:03.960 --> 1:00:04.960]  Jakari Jackson, you're taking that.
[1:00:04.960 --> 1:00:08.960]  That's exactly right, Alex, because we have the article pulled up here on 9.
[1:00:08.960 --> 1:00:13.960]  Maybe the guys can pull it up and it's talking about Border Patrol agents advised to release drunk drivers.
[1:00:13.960 --> 1:00:18.960]  And as you and I know, if we get caught drunk driving, you know, they're going to throw the book at us.
[1:00:18.960 --> 1:00:20.960]  And by the way, that CBS news.
[1:00:20.960 --> 1:00:21.960]  Okay, go ahead.
[1:00:21.960 --> 1:00:23.960]  Yeah, CBS out of Arizona.
[1:00:23.960 --> 1:00:28.960]  And they want to throw the book at you and I, but if somebody else comes in from a foreign country, it's like Paul Joseph Watson.
[1:00:28.960 --> 1:00:32.960]  He always reports on things talking about the political correctness of it.
[1:00:32.960 --> 1:00:38.960]  You know, if it's a Muslim or somebody else, they don't want to report on it or, you know, take any action.
[1:00:38.960 --> 1:00:39.960]  Oh, that's right.
[1:00:39.960 --> 1:00:42.960]  Thousands of girls raped and they wouldn't arrest any of them because they were Muslim.
[1:00:42.960 --> 1:00:44.960]  Yeah, they wouldn't arrest a guy because they want to be culturally insensitive.
[1:00:44.960 --> 1:00:47.960]  And that's not saying all Muslims are rapists, but it's just that one particular instance.
[1:00:47.960 --> 1:00:49.960]  What it's saying is Muslims are not above the law, though.
[1:00:49.960 --> 1:00:50.960]  Yeah.
[1:00:50.960 --> 1:00:51.960]  I mean, nobody's above the law.
[1:00:51.960 --> 1:00:53.960]  You know, I said it's not a racial issue.
[1:00:53.960 --> 1:00:54.960]  It's not a religious issue.
[1:00:54.960 --> 1:00:56.960]  But you shouldn't even have to qualify or apologize.
[1:00:56.960 --> 1:00:58.960]  I mean, I mean, and I do it too.
[1:00:58.960 --> 1:01:00.960]  It's just we're so under control of this.
[1:01:00.960 --> 1:01:02.960]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[1:01:02.960 --> 1:01:09.960]  And when we went out to South Texas last year and we had a chance to speak with what was his name?
[1:01:09.960 --> 1:01:11.960]  Pagan, I believe, was his name.
[1:01:11.960 --> 1:01:13.960]  He was the head emergency manager.
[1:01:13.960 --> 1:01:14.960]  Yeah.
[1:01:14.960 --> 1:01:17.960]  And he said that they're bringing them in, they're busting them in and they're giving them the vouchers.
[1:01:17.960 --> 1:01:19.960]  And I said, who is this that you're talking about, sir?
[1:01:19.960 --> 1:01:21.960]  And he says, you have the border patrol.
[1:01:21.960 --> 1:01:24.960]  They bring these guys in and then they give them the vouchers to go someplace else.
[1:01:24.960 --> 1:01:28.960]  And then when you go back to everybody who hasn't been to South Texas, when you come back,
[1:01:28.960 --> 1:01:31.960]  there's a permanent border patrol checkpoint.
[1:01:31.960 --> 1:01:34.960]  And they want to pull you over and ask, you know, are you American citizen?
[1:01:34.960 --> 1:01:39.960]  And, you know, we got to the point where we said, sir, if you want to find out where the illegals are going,
[1:01:39.960 --> 1:01:41.960]  we can tell you exactly where they are.
[1:01:41.960 --> 1:01:42.960]  We have photos.
[1:01:42.960 --> 1:01:43.960]  We have videos.
[1:01:43.960 --> 1:01:44.960]  We have articles.
[1:01:44.960 --> 1:01:46.960]  He says, yeah, we know about all those guys.
[1:01:46.960 --> 1:01:49.960]  We're just, we're just pretty much doing our jobs, you know, kind of the.
[1:01:49.960 --> 1:01:50.960]  Well, don't you have a clip of Biggs?
[1:01:50.960 --> 1:01:55.960]  Biggs is down there and he says, hey, you know, you're 75 miles into the border.
[1:01:55.960 --> 1:01:56.960]  There is no border now.
[1:01:56.960 --> 1:01:58.960]  We just showed the border wide open.
[1:01:58.960 --> 1:01:59.960]  Let us go through.
[1:01:59.960 --> 1:02:00.960]  And the guy goes, actually, you're right.
[1:02:00.960 --> 1:02:01.960]  Go through it.
[1:02:01.960 --> 1:02:02.960]  And he gets it.
[1:02:02.960 --> 1:02:03.960]  I mean, it's a total joke.
[1:02:03.960 --> 1:02:04.960]  Alex, they know it.
[1:02:04.960 --> 1:02:05.960]  They know it's just a big joke.
[1:02:05.960 --> 1:02:06.960]  It's smoke and mirrors.
[1:02:06.960 --> 1:02:07.960]  That's all it is.
[1:02:07.960 --> 1:02:09.960]  It's a magic trick to make people feel better.
[1:02:09.960 --> 1:02:10.960]  The border is down.
[1:02:10.960 --> 1:02:11.960]  We are wide open.
[1:02:11.960 --> 1:02:12.960]  Yeah.
[1:02:12.960 --> 1:02:16.960]  And pretty much even if we had said, you know, you know, we're illegals from wherever,
[1:02:16.960 --> 1:02:19.960]  they would have said, OK, they would just send us to the border patrol checkpoint,
[1:02:19.960 --> 1:02:21.960]  to the ice patrol, to the ice facility.
[1:02:21.960 --> 1:02:23.960]  To be given a voucher to go wherever you wanted.
[1:02:23.960 --> 1:02:28.960]  And pretty much all it was, we would have stopped driving and got on a bus to go someplace else.
[1:02:28.960 --> 1:02:30.960]  That's what it would have happened.
[1:02:30.960 --> 1:02:34.960]  You would have been delivered to a Democratic Party headquarters to then be indoctrinated
[1:02:34.960 --> 1:02:35.960]  given the funding you name it.
[1:02:35.960 --> 1:02:37.960]  I want you to do a man on the street.
[1:02:37.960 --> 1:02:40.960]  And I'm sure if you go to the liberal area, they'll agree that illegals shouldn't be given
[1:02:40.960 --> 1:02:41.960]  DWIs.
[1:02:41.960 --> 1:02:46.960]  Then go, should, if Obama says so, the illegals not be given DWIs because Obama says, they'll
[1:02:46.960 --> 1:02:47.960]  go, yes.
[1:02:47.960 --> 1:02:48.960]  But everyone else should.
[1:02:48.960 --> 1:02:49.960]  They'll go, yes.
[1:02:49.960 --> 1:02:51.960]  Show the mental illness.
[1:02:51.960 --> 1:02:56.960]  Jennings, you were saying that your concrete business got run out by illegals.
[1:02:56.960 --> 1:03:03.960]  Yeah, like, you know, every time I go on a job and I bid for a job that we'd have illegals
[1:03:03.960 --> 1:03:09.960]  that would come in right behind us and underbid us by two and three dollars, which is a huge
[1:03:09.960 --> 1:03:14.960]  amount of money in per square foot.
[1:03:14.960 --> 1:03:17.960]  And they come in and they do these jobs and ruin these people's floors.
[1:03:17.960 --> 1:03:22.960]  And then they go, well, I don't know what happened.
[1:03:22.960 --> 1:03:26.960]  Well, the issue is they're getting welfare, most of them, so they can underbid everybody
[1:03:26.960 --> 1:03:27.960]  and it's driving down wages.
[1:03:27.960 --> 1:03:29.960]  And then the left's like, raise our wages.
[1:03:29.960 --> 1:03:31.960]  The country is collapsing.
[1:03:31.960 --> 1:03:33.960]  The country is collapsing.
[1:03:33.960 --> 1:03:58.960]  Stay with us.
[1:04:03.960 --> 1:04:05.960]  I'm three, three, one, three, nine.
[1:04:34.960 --> 1:04:38.960]  In the near future.
[1:04:38.960 --> 1:04:42.960]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[1:04:42.960 --> 1:04:44.960]  Security, alert.
[1:04:44.960 --> 1:04:46.960]  This is Homeland Security.
[1:04:46.960 --> 1:04:50.960]  Analysis, info wars, building independent media operations.
[1:04:50.960 --> 1:04:55.960]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[1:04:55.960 --> 1:04:57.960]  Prime Directive, discredit Alex Jones.
[1:04:57.960 --> 1:05:00.960]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory.
[1:05:00.960 --> 1:05:03.960]  Talk show called info wars.
[1:05:03.960 --> 1:05:05.960]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[1:05:05.960 --> 1:05:07.960]  These people are assaulting us.
[1:05:07.960 --> 1:05:09.960]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[1:05:09.960 --> 1:05:11.960]  They are never going to stop.
[1:05:11.960 --> 1:05:15.960]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[1:05:15.960 --> 1:05:19.960]  Block free iPhone app at info wars.com.
[1:05:19.960 --> 1:05:22.960]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[1:05:22.960 --> 1:05:25.960]  Imperative, Detroit, Britain.
[1:05:25.960 --> 1:05:27.960]  You got a censor eye on the enemy.
[1:05:27.960 --> 1:05:30.960]  Not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[1:05:30.960 --> 1:05:59.960]  Electrally, it's for God you can fail it.
[1:06:00.960 --> 1:06:02.960]  In the near future.
[1:06:02.960 --> 1:06:31.960]  In the near future.
[1:06:32.960 --> 1:06:33.960]  In the near future.
[1:06:33.960 --> 1:07:02.960]  In the near future.
[1:07:02.960 --> 1:07:06.960]  Now we've known this has been going on for at least six, seven years, but now it's in CBS News.
[1:07:06.960 --> 1:07:10.960]  Border Patrol agents advised to release drunk drivers.
[1:07:10.960 --> 1:07:17.960]  Well, we read earlier from the actual judicial watch document that's up on info wars.com.
[1:07:17.960 --> 1:07:23.960]  And it says, quote, allow them to go on their way and if they kill somebody, it is not your fault.
[1:07:23.960 --> 1:07:26.960]  It actually says that you have no responsibility.
[1:07:26.960 --> 1:07:31.960]  That's not true under the Constitution Bill of Rights under federal and state law.
[1:07:31.960 --> 1:07:36.960]  If you knowingly know someone's going to commit a crime, not even as a sworn officer and you let them do it.
[1:07:36.960 --> 1:07:37.960]  You are liable.
[1:07:37.960 --> 1:07:40.960]  You're now aiding and abetting.
[1:07:40.960 --> 1:07:42.960]  Now I spent most of the last hour getting into this.
[1:07:42.960 --> 1:07:45.960]  I just wanted to dovetail it with this report.
[1:07:45.960 --> 1:07:47.960]  Because citizens get the book thrown at them.
[1:07:47.960 --> 1:07:48.960]  It's not just drunk driving.
[1:07:48.960 --> 1:07:52.960]  It's aggravated felonies, rape, robbery, armed robbery.
[1:07:52.960 --> 1:07:57.960]  Elderly man facing 10 years over unloaded flintlock.
[1:07:57.960 --> 1:07:59.960]  Made in 1762.
[1:07:59.960 --> 1:08:05.960]  You're trying to go to a gun show or a swap meet to sell your...
[1:08:05.960 --> 1:08:07.960]  I'm talking about a firearm, really.
[1:08:07.960 --> 1:08:10.960]  It's not classified as that by the BATF.
[1:08:10.960 --> 1:08:11.960]  They don't care.
[1:08:11.960 --> 1:08:14.960]  They're going to classify it and try to put you under the jail.
[1:08:14.960 --> 1:08:17.960]  Elderly man facing 10 years over unloaded flintlock.
[1:08:17.960 --> 1:08:21.960]  Prosecutors want retired teacher to serve 3.5 years at least.
[1:08:21.960 --> 1:08:28.960]  Because they love someone with no criminal record who had no intent for possessing 250-year-old pistol.
[1:08:28.960 --> 1:08:32.960]  Gordon Van Gilder, 72, has charged the felony in New Jersey.
[1:08:32.960 --> 1:08:34.960]  He had retold the Cumberland County Sheriff's Deputy.
[1:08:34.960 --> 1:08:36.960]  He had a flintlock pistol in his car during a traffic stop.
[1:08:36.960 --> 1:08:39.960]  See, being honest, he also puts you under the jail.
[1:08:39.960 --> 1:08:45.960]  Because this system is so evil that it wants to target good people.
[1:08:45.960 --> 1:08:47.960]  Because it's a criminal system now.
[1:08:47.960 --> 1:08:49.960]  Just like the illegals are above the law.
[1:08:49.960 --> 1:08:53.960]  Just like the private Federal Reserve gets trillions in bailout money.
[1:08:53.960 --> 1:08:57.960]  But if an old lady doesn't pay her income tax, they take her house without due process.
[1:08:57.960 --> 1:09:00.960]  That article is up on infowars.com right now.
[1:09:00.960 --> 1:09:05.960]  Kit Daniels and links through to the local newspaper of the source of the original report.
[1:09:05.960 --> 1:09:11.960]  And they are proudly trying to put him in jail and ruin his life with pleasure.
[1:09:11.960 --> 1:09:16.960]  Because, see, producers and non-criminals are the milkcouch.
[1:09:16.960 --> 1:09:18.960]  And we need to be enslaved.
[1:09:18.960 --> 1:09:21.960]  And so that means create all these laws, throw the book at us,
[1:09:21.960 --> 1:09:24.960]  and then exempt the government, the police and the illegal aliens from it.
[1:09:24.960 --> 1:09:28.960]  That's what you call 21st century tyranny.
[1:09:28.960 --> 1:09:32.960]  Talk about discrimination constantly.
[1:09:32.960 --> 1:09:37.960]  And say brown bags in Seattle, Associated Press are racist.
[1:09:37.960 --> 1:09:39.960]  You will be fired if you're seen with a brown bag. It's hurtful.
[1:09:39.960 --> 1:09:42.960]  No one ever said a brown bag was a racist symbol.
[1:09:42.960 --> 1:09:45.960]  No one ever said watermelon and fried chicken was a racist symbol.
[1:09:45.960 --> 1:09:48.960]  They just put it out there so there's more and more stuff
[1:09:48.960 --> 1:09:51.960]  that then the racist will actually pick up on on all sides
[1:09:51.960 --> 1:09:56.960]  to where we're all obsessed with race and know nothing about anything else.
[1:09:56.960 --> 1:10:00.960]  While we're being discriminated against by mega corporations that are tax-exempt,
[1:10:00.960 --> 1:10:04.960]  while lobbying for higher taxes on us to shut down their competition.
[1:10:04.960 --> 1:10:09.960]  While big banks launder drug money, while lobbying for more drug laws to keep the price up.
[1:10:09.960 --> 1:10:12.960]  Now, I went there because there's new books out.
[1:10:12.960 --> 1:10:14.960]  We're going to get into that, get into the economy.
[1:10:14.960 --> 1:10:15.960]  He was on like four years ago with us.
[1:10:15.960 --> 1:10:17.960]  Everybody knows who Robert Kiyosaki is,
[1:10:17.960 --> 1:10:23.960]  the mega million best time seller, author of Rich Dad, Poor Dad, Successful.
[1:10:23.960 --> 1:10:27.960]  Entrepreneur owns mines all over the world and factories.
[1:10:27.960 --> 1:10:29.960]  I mean, he's a true entrepreneur.
[1:10:29.960 --> 1:10:33.960]  Anyone who's been an entrepreneur knows that's the heart of everything.
[1:10:33.960 --> 1:10:35.960]  So they demonize entrepreneurship.
[1:10:35.960 --> 1:10:37.960]  Like Obama said, if you have a business, you didn't build that.
[1:10:37.960 --> 1:10:38.960]  Somebody else built that.
[1:10:38.960 --> 1:10:43.960]  So when Kiyosaki speaks with us the next 50 minutes, this is not Kiyosaki.
[1:10:43.960 --> 1:10:45.960]  This is the state speaking.
[1:10:45.960 --> 1:10:48.960]  And Cuomo has come out and said, I have the quote here.
[1:10:48.960 --> 1:10:52.960]  We played the clip earlier, that our rights do not come from God.
[1:10:52.960 --> 1:10:54.960]  They come from the state.
[1:10:54.960 --> 1:10:58.960]  But we say God, even if you're an atheist, so that the state doesn't become God.
[1:10:58.960 --> 1:11:03.960]  Duh, put something above the state, the individual's above the state here.
[1:11:03.960 --> 1:11:04.960]  So we want to get down to it.
[1:11:04.960 --> 1:11:05.960]  We're saying we are God.
[1:11:05.960 --> 1:11:08.960]  That ought to make you Satanist happy.
[1:11:08.960 --> 1:11:11.960]  But you can't even get that, can you?
[1:11:11.960 --> 1:11:12.960]  You do not.
[1:11:12.960 --> 1:11:14.960]  The state must be God.
[1:11:14.960 --> 1:11:18.960]  So I wanted to bring up real discrimination with Robert Kiyosaki.
[1:11:18.960 --> 1:11:20.960]  Throw him a curveball first.
[1:11:20.960 --> 1:11:24.960]  Best known for Rich Dad Poor Dad, number one personal finance book of all time.
[1:11:24.960 --> 1:11:29.960]  Kiyosaki has challenged and changed the way tens of millions of people around the world think about money.
[1:11:29.960 --> 1:11:32.960]  He's an entrepreneur, educator, investor who believes in world needs more entrepreneurs.
[1:11:32.960 --> 1:11:34.960]  And he's got a new book out.
[1:11:34.960 --> 1:11:38.960]  The second chance for your money, your life, and your world just came out this month.
[1:11:38.960 --> 1:11:44.960]  It's already a bestseller at richdad.com, richdad.com, I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com.
[1:11:44.960 --> 1:11:50.960]  What do you think about them trying to label things that obviously aren't racist as racist to divert,
[1:11:50.960 --> 1:11:56.960]  or do you disagree with me, from all the real discrimination that's going on inside government
[1:11:56.960 --> 1:11:59.960]  and by the governing class and those that are allied with them?
[1:11:59.960 --> 1:12:05.960]  I see this as causing a major trend of lawlessness as people realize if we have a rogue government,
[1:12:05.960 --> 1:12:09.960]  we cannot follow their laws because they're illegitimate.
[1:12:09.960 --> 1:12:15.960]  I see this as what brings in anarchy, and anarchy is not the road I'm on,
[1:12:15.960 --> 1:12:18.960]  but if you'd like, you can come along.
[1:12:18.960 --> 1:12:23.960]  Well, I don't want a road warrior society, but they claim they're here to bring order.
[1:12:23.960 --> 1:12:25.960]  It seems they're bringing disorder.
[1:12:25.960 --> 1:12:30.960]  Where do you see the world going and how do you tie this into your larger world view, Robert?
[1:12:30.960 --> 1:12:35.960]  Well, first of all, I really do enjoy fried chicken and watermelon.
[1:12:35.960 --> 1:12:37.960]  Exactly, I do too.
[1:12:37.960 --> 1:12:39.960]  It doesn't make me a racist.
[1:12:39.960 --> 1:12:48.960]  But I think really what you're saying I agree with is that too many people keep the water stirred up,
[1:12:48.960 --> 1:12:52.960]  and when the water is stirred up and muddy and confusing,
[1:12:52.960 --> 1:12:57.960]  the people listening to the media or watching the reading and things in the paper,
[1:12:57.960 --> 1:13:00.960]  is they cannot make logical decisions.
[1:13:00.960 --> 1:13:05.960]  And some people, like you said, they don't know what's going on because they're all stirred up all the time,
[1:13:05.960 --> 1:13:12.960]  making these really stupid remarks about this and that and racism and guns, and it's just goofy.
[1:13:12.960 --> 1:13:15.960]  And we're in a bad situation right now.
[1:13:15.960 --> 1:13:19.960]  Well, the political elite have obviously fostered this because, as you said, the fog of war,
[1:13:19.960 --> 1:13:24.960]  it confuses us and confounds us, but won't it end up making the country really have problems
[1:13:24.960 --> 1:13:29.960]  if they've got school kids obsessing and crying over brown paper bags while, meanwhile,
[1:13:29.960 --> 1:13:35.960]  Obama is butchering the Bill of Rights and Constitution along with the Republicans?
[1:13:35.960 --> 1:13:37.960]  That's what I think.
[1:13:37.960 --> 1:13:40.960]  My rant, for those of you who have read Rich Dad, Poor Dad,
[1:13:40.960 --> 1:13:45.960]  my whole rant for the last 20 years has been why don't we have financial education in our schools?
[1:13:45.960 --> 1:13:49.960]  Why are they talking about brown bags and fried chicken and watermelon?
[1:13:49.960 --> 1:13:54.960]  When you look at, and I'm not Republican or Democrat, I don't have a dog in that fight.
[1:13:54.960 --> 1:13:55.960]  Same here.
[1:13:55.960 --> 1:13:59.960]  But when you have a president who comes from Hawaii like I do,
[1:13:59.960 --> 1:14:04.960]  and he went to one of the richest schools in Hawaii, but the guy knows nothing about money,
[1:14:04.960 --> 1:14:09.960]  and when you have a guy who knows nothing about money, but actually comes from a poor background,
[1:14:09.960 --> 1:14:17.960]  that poor background is going to affect their view on people who make money, people who are rich.
[1:14:17.960 --> 1:14:21.960]  And I think really that's the biggest problem because from President of the United States down,
[1:14:21.960 --> 1:14:25.960]  senators and congressmen, military officers and all that,
[1:14:25.960 --> 1:14:31.960]  millions of people today who work for the government now expect the government to take care of them.
[1:14:31.960 --> 1:14:36.960]  Detroit went bankrupt because they couldn't pay for pensions.
[1:14:36.960 --> 1:14:38.960]  And why is it?
[1:14:38.960 --> 1:14:42.960]  Why is Obama going to make more money after he's president than when he did when he was working?
[1:14:42.960 --> 1:14:46.960]  Why are senators and congressmen paying exorbitant pensions
[1:14:46.960 --> 1:14:48.960]  when they only work for one term?
[1:14:48.960 --> 1:14:52.960]  At the same time, you have millions of poor people or people who are struggling,
[1:14:52.960 --> 1:14:55.960]  people who own businesses who may never be able to retire.
[1:14:55.960 --> 1:14:56.960]  And that's a crime.
[1:14:56.960 --> 1:15:00.960]  And that's why I say why isn't there financial education in our schools?
[1:15:00.960 --> 1:15:01.960]  That's right.
[1:15:01.960 --> 1:15:06.960]  They have demonized making money, saving money, how to build a business.
[1:15:06.960 --> 1:15:11.960]  They've just taught us go work for the big corporation in a drone facility.
[1:15:11.960 --> 1:15:19.960]  And they've created all this class warfare, Obama lands in a giant jet with 14 other support aircraft
[1:15:19.960 --> 1:15:26.960]  and then over 200 secret service and then tells Nigerians you shouldn't have air conditioning or a car.
[1:15:26.960 --> 1:15:30.960]  He doesn't say we should have cleaner cars or cleaner air conditioning and innovate new sciences
[1:15:30.960 --> 1:15:35.960]  and that Africa, you know, could innovate and lead the world if they had that idea.
[1:15:35.960 --> 1:15:37.960]  No, he just says you're going to stay in mud huts.
[1:15:37.960 --> 1:15:38.960]  How's that sound?
[1:15:38.960 --> 1:15:45.960]  And then he is there basically delivered by a high tech flying carpet.
[1:15:45.960 --> 1:15:47.960]  I agree a whole lot.
[1:15:47.960 --> 1:15:49.960]  I don't remember, but I was a pilot.
[1:15:49.960 --> 1:15:54.960]  I flew for the Marine Corps in Vietnam and I know how much it cost to run a plane.
[1:15:54.960 --> 1:16:00.960]  I remember when Clinton was running for office, he actually parked the 747 and left it running
[1:16:00.960 --> 1:16:03.960]  so somebody could give him a $200 haircut.
[1:16:03.960 --> 1:16:04.960]  No, I remember that.
[1:16:04.960 --> 1:16:06.960]  And people were outraged back then.
[1:16:06.960 --> 1:16:07.960]  Yeah.
[1:16:07.960 --> 1:16:12.960]  Is there outrage fatigue now because stuff is getting more and more over the top or where do you
[1:16:12.960 --> 1:16:15.960]  and I'm going to skip this network break because I want to give our guests more time.
[1:16:15.960 --> 1:16:20.960]  Robert Kiyosaki, bestselling author of all time for self-help finance book is our guest.
[1:16:20.960 --> 1:16:21.960]  Got a new book out.
[1:16:21.960 --> 1:16:22.960]  We're going to talk about that book.
[1:16:22.960 --> 1:16:25.960]  But I mean, the world is just crazy at this point.
[1:16:25.960 --> 1:16:28.960]  Give us your prognosis for the planet.
[1:16:28.960 --> 1:16:32.960]  There's obviously opportunities for those of us that are studying it.
[1:16:32.960 --> 1:16:36.960]  I mean, I'm going to do better probably than ever as things get worse, but I'm not happy about that
[1:16:36.960 --> 1:16:39.960]  because I know it's hurting the average person.
[1:16:39.960 --> 1:16:40.960]  Amen.
[1:16:40.960 --> 1:16:43.960]  Alex, I would say exactly the same thing.
[1:16:43.960 --> 1:16:48.960]  It doesn't make me happy that I'm getting richer and richer and I see my friends getting poorer
[1:16:48.960 --> 1:16:49.960]  and poorer.
[1:16:49.960 --> 1:16:54.960]  I'm very concerned right now about, you know, my generation, the baby boom generation,
[1:16:54.960 --> 1:16:56.960]  the biggest generation in history.
[1:16:56.960 --> 1:17:02.960]  And they bought that program of put all your money in a 401k and invest for the long term.
[1:17:02.960 --> 1:17:07.960]  Now, I wrote a book called Rich Dad's Prophecy back in 2002.
[1:17:07.960 --> 1:17:10.960]  That was 14 years ago or 13 years ago.
[1:17:10.960 --> 1:17:15.960]  And I said the biggest stock market crash in the history of the world was coming in 2016.
[1:17:15.960 --> 1:17:19.960]  I was kind of guessing, but unfortunately, I didn't write it to be right.
[1:17:19.960 --> 1:17:21.960]  I wrote it out of concern.
[1:17:21.960 --> 1:17:28.960]  If I'm correct that in 2002, when I said the biggest market crash was coming in 2016,
[1:17:28.960 --> 1:17:34.960]  that means millions and millions of baby boomers, their kids, their grandkids will feel the effect
[1:17:34.960 --> 1:17:37.960]  of that when their retirement savings are wiped out.
[1:17:37.960 --> 1:17:43.960]  I hope I'm wrong, but so far my numbers look accurate and it's holding course right now.
[1:17:43.960 --> 1:17:47.960]  So I don't write because I want to be rich or poke fun or be righteous.
[1:17:47.960 --> 1:17:50.960]  I am really concerned about my fellow citizens.
[1:17:50.960 --> 1:17:54.960]  It's frustrating because when you know how this stuff really works, you can position yourself
[1:17:54.960 --> 1:17:59.960]  and do well, and then just the average person, even if they seem smart or a friend,
[1:17:59.960 --> 1:18:05.960]  they just keep doing what CNBC and CNN say, not even that those places have big audiences anymore,
[1:18:05.960 --> 1:18:07.960]  but still it's the authority.
[1:18:07.960 --> 1:18:12.960]  But with Brian Williams fall, I think that's one of the big dominoes to go down
[1:18:12.960 --> 1:18:14.960]  with a loss of confidence in the system.
[1:18:14.960 --> 1:18:17.960]  What's your take on the future of the media?
[1:18:17.960 --> 1:18:18.960]  Well, I think it's manipulative.
[1:18:18.960 --> 1:18:20.960]  You and I are on the same boat again.
[1:18:20.960 --> 1:18:21.960]  It's not free media.
[1:18:21.960 --> 1:18:22.960]  It's controlled media.
[1:18:22.960 --> 1:18:24.960]  If you have money, you control the media.
[1:18:24.960 --> 1:18:26.960]  If you don't have media, you don't have that money.
[1:18:26.960 --> 1:18:28.960]  You don't control it.
[1:18:28.960 --> 1:18:33.960]  When Rich Dad Porter came out in 1997 and I started saying your house is not an asset,
[1:18:33.960 --> 1:18:37.960]  I was foretelling the crash coming in 2007.
[1:18:37.960 --> 1:18:38.960]  We should talk about your predictions.
[1:18:38.960 --> 1:18:39.960]  Rattle off some of those.
[1:18:39.960 --> 1:18:42.960]  They're amazing and their own record.
[1:18:42.960 --> 1:18:44.960]  Well, there was three.
[1:18:44.960 --> 1:18:48.960]  One was that Savers would be losers and that was in 1997.
[1:18:48.960 --> 1:18:53.960]  And in 2007, when the markets crashed and the Fed began printing money,
[1:18:53.960 --> 1:18:56.960]  as you know, Savers are losers.
[1:18:56.960 --> 1:18:58.960]  Also said your house is not an asset.
[1:18:58.960 --> 1:19:01.960]  And your house is the biggest asset for many of the middle class.
[1:19:01.960 --> 1:19:06.960]  And as you know, the real estate market has not yet recovered.
[1:19:06.960 --> 1:19:08.960]  Excuse me.
[1:19:08.960 --> 1:19:16.960]  And then I predicted in 2002, a massive crash would come prior to 2016.
[1:19:16.960 --> 1:19:17.960]  You did.
[1:19:17.960 --> 1:19:20.960]  And it came in 2007.
[1:19:20.960 --> 1:19:22.960]  And now this is the other side of the coin.
[1:19:22.960 --> 1:19:25.960]  I was talking about all coins have three sides.
[1:19:25.960 --> 1:19:27.960]  Heads, tails, and the edge.
[1:19:27.960 --> 1:19:31.960]  You know, you have Republicans on one side, Democrats on the other side,
[1:19:31.960 --> 1:19:34.960]  capitalism on one side, social on the other side.
[1:19:34.960 --> 1:19:38.960]  But our job as private citizens is to be on the edge looking at both sides.
[1:19:38.960 --> 1:19:39.960]  That's right.
[1:19:39.960 --> 1:19:45.960]  Fortunately, when the market crashed in 2007, the poor middle class got wiped out.
[1:19:45.960 --> 1:19:47.960]  But the rich got richer.
[1:19:47.960 --> 1:19:52.960]  And one of the ways the rich got richer is the very banks that put out all this quantitative easing
[1:19:52.960 --> 1:19:56.960]  were offering guys like me, literally hundreds of millions of dollars
[1:19:56.960 --> 1:19:59.960]  to buy the very real estate that was wiped out.
[1:19:59.960 --> 1:20:05.960]  And so what I write about and I talk about is that the rich are richer
[1:20:05.960 --> 1:20:07.960]  because they're on the other side of the coin.
[1:20:07.960 --> 1:20:09.960]  They don't go to school to get a job.
[1:20:09.960 --> 1:20:12.960]  They go to school to learn to be rich, how to start corporations.
[1:20:12.960 --> 1:20:16.960]  And let's go above you at the level of actually building things in a good,
[1:20:16.960 --> 1:20:20.960]  you know, corporate businessman, true capitalist.
[1:20:20.960 --> 1:20:23.960]  And above that is the real enemy, the crony capitalist.
[1:20:23.960 --> 1:20:26.960]  You're just piggybacking on them looking at both sides of the coin.
[1:20:26.960 --> 1:20:28.960]  Good businessman, bad businessman, you can do it.
[1:20:28.960 --> 1:20:29.960]  I can do it.
[1:20:29.960 --> 1:20:32.960]  We've got to get the public to start actually getting outside the box,
[1:20:32.960 --> 1:20:34.960]  you know, looking at the edge of the coin.
[1:20:34.960 --> 1:20:36.960]  The problem is, is they'll go above this.
[1:20:36.960 --> 1:20:38.960]  They'll finance Al Qaeda.
[1:20:38.960 --> 1:20:39.960]  That doesn't mean they run them.
[1:20:39.960 --> 1:20:43.960]  They'll finance ISIS and then make hundreds of billions off fighting them.
[1:20:43.960 --> 1:20:45.960]  And the public goes, what, you say we command them?
[1:20:45.960 --> 1:20:48.960]  No, no, but we help get them going.
[1:20:48.960 --> 1:20:53.960]  And then they'll use them by, again, gaming the dialectic to get more power.
[1:20:53.960 --> 1:20:56.960]  How do you get the public to think like an executive?
[1:20:56.960 --> 1:21:01.960]  I just, I just, you know, some people tell me either someone's got it or they don't, Robert.
[1:21:01.960 --> 1:21:04.960]  Well, let me give you like, I always write about three sides of a coin,
[1:21:04.960 --> 1:21:06.960]  heads, tails and the edge.
[1:21:06.960 --> 1:21:09.960]  I was a Marine in Vietnam in 1972.
[1:21:09.960 --> 1:21:11.960]  I was standing out there.
[1:21:11.960 --> 1:21:14.960]  And you remember a call in 71 Nixon took us off the gold standard.
[1:21:14.960 --> 1:21:15.960]  Yes.
[1:21:15.960 --> 1:21:18.960]  And I'm standing out there going, what the heck does this mean?
[1:21:18.960 --> 1:21:24.960]  So I wrote about that event in a book called Conspiracy of the Rich is when I was like 25 years old,
[1:21:24.960 --> 1:21:30.960]  you know, I'm talking to this Vietnamese fruit seller and she wouldn't take a $50 bill.
[1:21:30.960 --> 1:21:36.960]  And so here in 25, 26 years old going, what's going on? And she didn't want the dollar.
[1:21:36.960 --> 1:21:37.960]  She wanted gold.
[1:21:37.960 --> 1:21:44.960]  And so that's when I went, oh my God, plus Vietnam was kind of a wake up call for me because I realized
[1:21:44.960 --> 1:21:48.960]  we, the public are lied to by those that control the military industrial complex.
[1:21:48.960 --> 1:21:50.960]  Now I'm not against war, pro war.
[1:21:50.960 --> 1:21:52.960]  It's not like being lied to.
[1:21:52.960 --> 1:21:54.960]  You're against the special interest being above the law.
[1:21:54.960 --> 1:21:55.960]  Yeah.
[1:21:55.960 --> 1:22:00.960]  And so when the market started coming down, again, I say that the other side of the coin,
[1:22:00.960 --> 1:22:02.960]  I didn't want to be on the side that was losing.
[1:22:02.960 --> 1:22:04.960]  I want to be on the side that's winning.
[1:22:04.960 --> 1:22:08.960]  But as you know, the media controls the message.
[1:22:08.960 --> 1:22:12.960]  And so it keeps the poor middle class interpolated, always upset,
[1:22:12.960 --> 1:22:17.960]  discussing things that really don't matter like brown bag lunches with chicken in it.
[1:22:17.960 --> 1:22:18.960]  Exactly.
[1:22:18.960 --> 1:22:19.960]  Yeah.
[1:22:19.960 --> 1:22:20.960]  It's ridiculous.
[1:22:20.960 --> 1:22:22.960]  Don't have a brown bag and don't bring chicken in the fried.
[1:22:22.960 --> 1:22:23.960]  It's racist.
[1:22:23.960 --> 1:22:25.960]  I mean, it's crazy.
[1:22:25.960 --> 1:22:26.960]  Yeah.
[1:22:26.960 --> 1:22:27.960]  And that's what we are.
[1:22:27.960 --> 1:22:32.960]  Or, you know, when I talked to, I had this person apply for the job to the day and she
[1:22:32.960 --> 1:22:35.960]  was like, really stopped from school.
[1:22:35.960 --> 1:22:36.960]  She did nothing.
[1:22:36.960 --> 1:22:41.960]  I was going, she had no, I should apply for a job, but she had no idea what my company did.
[1:22:41.960 --> 1:22:44.960]  She just wanted a job and wouldn't know how much I'm going to pay her.
[1:22:44.960 --> 1:22:46.960]  If I wanted a job, I'd research everything about you.
[1:22:46.960 --> 1:22:47.960]  I'd come in saying, I want to help you.
[1:22:47.960 --> 1:22:48.960]  This is what I can offer.
[1:22:48.960 --> 1:22:50.960]  I'd like to advance your company.
[1:22:50.960 --> 1:22:51.960]  I'd like to prove myself.
[1:22:51.960 --> 1:22:53.960]  I really like your philosophy, Mr. Kiyosaki.
[1:22:53.960 --> 1:22:56.960]  No, they just show up and go, yeah, you're lucky if you get me.
[1:22:56.960 --> 1:22:58.960]  You know, it's just amazing.
[1:22:58.960 --> 1:23:03.960]  Worse than that, Alex, I was afraid when the interview was over, I was going to get sued.
[1:23:03.960 --> 1:23:04.960]  Wow.
[1:23:04.960 --> 1:23:05.960]  That's not, you know what I mean?
[1:23:05.960 --> 1:23:08.960]  Because it'd be the sexual harassment or discrimination.
[1:23:08.960 --> 1:23:14.960]  You know, as an employer, I'm terrified of what I even say to potential employees.
[1:23:14.960 --> 1:23:16.960]  That's how politically correct we are.
[1:23:16.960 --> 1:23:17.960]  Oh yeah.
[1:23:17.960 --> 1:23:19.960]  You don't want to tell a woman, oh, I think your blouse is nice.
[1:23:19.960 --> 1:23:20.960]  Oh, that's, that's evil.
[1:23:20.960 --> 1:23:21.960]  That's horrible.
[1:23:21.960 --> 1:23:24.960]  Of course, that's a totally normal human activity, but it's evil.
[1:23:24.960 --> 1:23:26.960]  And it wasn't nice, but I didn't say that.
[1:23:26.960 --> 1:23:31.960]  But I mean, I don't want to say to even like an old lady, oh, I like your coat.
[1:23:31.960 --> 1:23:36.960]  You know, I'll say, oh, I like your dog on the hiking bike trail because everything's politically incorrect now.
[1:23:36.960 --> 1:23:37.960]  That's correct.
[1:23:37.960 --> 1:23:43.960]  And I think, you know, what we're talking about without describing it is probably the problem.
[1:23:43.960 --> 1:23:47.960]  We're so stirred up all over the place, nobody's listening anymore.
[1:23:47.960 --> 1:23:50.960]  You know, everybody's talking, but nobody's listening.
[1:23:50.960 --> 1:23:51.960]  So I'm going holy mackerel.
[1:23:51.960 --> 1:23:53.960]  You know, this is not a good time to read.
[1:23:53.960 --> 1:23:54.960]  Robert, I want to give you the floor.
[1:23:54.960 --> 1:23:55.960]  We got five minutes till break.
[1:23:55.960 --> 1:24:00.960]  I've been asking some of the questions up front, but front and center, what is most important to you?
[1:24:00.960 --> 1:24:01.960]  Good, bad, and ugly right now.
[1:24:01.960 --> 1:24:05.960]  We're going to come back from break in about five minutes and get into your new book.
[1:24:05.960 --> 1:24:08.960]  I'm just concerned about this possible.
[1:24:08.960 --> 1:24:09.960]  I hope it doesn't happen.
[1:24:09.960 --> 1:24:16.960]  But if my rich dad was correct, again, published in 2002, Rich Dad's Prophecy predicted the biggest crash in the history of the world.
[1:24:16.960 --> 1:24:19.960]  It was coming in 2016.
[1:24:19.960 --> 1:24:21.960]  And that's why I wrote Rich Dad, Poor Dad.
[1:24:21.960 --> 1:24:22.960]  That's why I speak.
[1:24:22.960 --> 1:24:23.960]  That's why I write.
[1:24:23.960 --> 1:24:25.960]  That's why I take on the media.
[1:24:25.960 --> 1:24:28.960]  But I'm very concerned for my citizens.
[1:24:28.960 --> 1:24:30.960]  Look, Alex, what happens at this?
[1:24:30.960 --> 1:24:31.960]  Let's say I'm right.
[1:24:31.960 --> 1:24:32.960]  Hopefully I'm not.
[1:24:32.960 --> 1:24:36.960]  And millions of baby boomers lose their pensions, their homes, their jobs.
[1:24:36.960 --> 1:24:37.960]  They lose everything.
[1:24:37.960 --> 1:24:41.960]  What is the ripple effect throughout the world going to mean to that?
[1:24:41.960 --> 1:24:42.960]  What is it?
[1:24:42.960 --> 1:24:43.960]  We've never been here before.
[1:24:43.960 --> 1:24:50.960]  Never before has the US dollar, one currency, been the reserve currency of the world, and we're printing it.
[1:24:50.960 --> 1:24:51.960]  Wow.
[1:24:51.960 --> 1:24:53.960]  The Europeans are printing.
[1:24:53.960 --> 1:24:54.960]  Japanese are printing.
[1:24:54.960 --> 1:24:57.960]  And you got to look at this and go, this is not good.
[1:24:57.960 --> 1:24:59.960]  So that's my concern right now.
[1:24:59.960 --> 1:25:04.960]  Well, look, your prediction will come true, whether it's this year, next year, or two years down the road of three years.
[1:25:04.960 --> 1:25:06.960]  It was in Bobway, Weimar.
[1:25:06.960 --> 1:25:07.960]  I mean, let's talk about that history.
[1:25:07.960 --> 1:25:11.960]  I mean, does it this always end in a serious collapse?
[1:25:11.960 --> 1:25:12.960]  I mean, it doesn't go anywhere else.
[1:25:12.960 --> 1:25:16.960]  My only concern is how big will it get before it implodes?
[1:25:16.960 --> 1:25:18.960]  I want to have a controlled crash landing.
[1:25:18.960 --> 1:25:19.960]  Yes.
[1:25:19.960 --> 1:25:27.960]  The point here is the last 100 years has been 52 so-called currencies that collapse, 52 in the last 100 years.
[1:25:27.960 --> 1:25:28.960]  But never.
[1:25:28.960 --> 1:25:35.960]  The reason 1972 me standing on the fields of Vietnam was so important was that for the very first time in history,
[1:25:35.960 --> 1:25:39.960]  the US dollar is the currency of the world.
[1:25:39.960 --> 1:25:44.960]  And if the dollar goes bad or something skews up, the whole world goes down.
[1:25:44.960 --> 1:25:47.960]  It's not like just in Bobway or Weimar.
[1:25:47.960 --> 1:25:49.960]  It's the whole world.
[1:25:49.960 --> 1:25:51.960]  It is the biggest collapse possible.
[1:25:51.960 --> 1:25:53.960]  And we have no financial education.
[1:25:53.960 --> 1:25:55.960]  We don't tell kid people this.
[1:25:55.960 --> 1:25:59.960]  The biggest collapse possible, a global Weimar.
[1:25:59.960 --> 1:26:02.960]  What will that look like?
[1:26:02.960 --> 1:26:05.960]  Alex, you know, Harry Dent.
[1:26:05.960 --> 1:26:06.960]  Yeah.
[1:26:06.960 --> 1:26:07.960]  Yeah.
[1:26:07.960 --> 1:26:14.960]  Right after I talked to him yesterday, I was put on suicide watch.
[1:26:14.960 --> 1:26:18.960]  You know, I can't even fathom what it might be.
[1:26:18.960 --> 1:26:19.960]  I can't imagine it.
[1:26:19.960 --> 1:26:26.960]  Because I was in Zimbabwe in 2004 just to go see what a currency collapse looks like.
[1:26:26.960 --> 1:26:27.960]  I knew that.
[1:26:27.960 --> 1:26:28.960]  I read an article that quoted you.
[1:26:28.960 --> 1:26:29.960]  Tell us about that.
[1:26:29.960 --> 1:26:32.960]  Well, it was just extremely frightening.
[1:26:32.960 --> 1:26:35.960]  You know, what happens when your money is no good is the question.
[1:26:35.960 --> 1:26:36.960]  What happens when you can't trade?
[1:26:36.960 --> 1:26:38.960]  What happens if you can't buy food?
[1:26:38.960 --> 1:26:41.960]  You know, and people do goofy things.
[1:26:41.960 --> 1:26:46.960]  And in fact, you know, I was part, I was accosted by what they call the war vets.
[1:26:46.960 --> 1:26:49.960]  You know, these guys at AK-47s.
[1:26:49.960 --> 1:26:55.960]  And I hear I was out there going, you know, I'm not here to change your political views.
[1:26:55.960 --> 1:26:57.960]  I just want to find out what's going on.
[1:26:57.960 --> 1:26:58.960]  But they didn't care.
[1:26:58.960 --> 1:27:02.960]  They were afraid I was part of the CIA or something, which I'm not.
[1:27:02.960 --> 1:27:05.960]  But I'm going, hey, I'm just here to find out.
[1:27:05.960 --> 1:27:07.960]  But it was so tense.
[1:27:07.960 --> 1:27:09.960]  You know, there was a little woman.
[1:27:09.960 --> 1:27:11.960]  She was about probably 80 years old.
[1:27:11.960 --> 1:27:17.960]  The war vets went to her farm in Zimbabwe and kicked her off.
[1:27:17.960 --> 1:27:19.960]  And I saw this little lady.
[1:27:19.960 --> 1:27:20.960]  She comes up to me.
[1:27:20.960 --> 1:27:25.960]  She says, you know, they're just screaming at me in Africa, which I don't speak.
[1:27:25.960 --> 1:27:29.960]  But it was just a futility after 400 years.
[1:27:29.960 --> 1:27:31.960]  She and her husband lose the farm.
[1:27:31.960 --> 1:27:33.960]  Their parents gave it to them.
[1:27:33.960 --> 1:27:36.960]  And I don't know if that's going to happen here, but it's frightening.
[1:27:36.960 --> 1:27:42.960]  The thing I did find out in Zimbabwe was what kind of triggered the collapse of Zimbabwe dollar.
[1:27:42.960 --> 1:27:45.960]  It was a thing called retirement pensions.
[1:27:45.960 --> 1:27:46.960]  That's right.
[1:27:46.960 --> 1:27:49.960]  And the U.S. is sitting at the same precarious position right now.
[1:27:49.960 --> 1:27:51.960]  Wasn't it government pensions?
[1:27:51.960 --> 1:27:52.960]  Any kind of pension.
[1:27:52.960 --> 1:27:53.960]  Yeah.
[1:27:53.960 --> 1:27:57.960]  With millions of people counting on the government pension to keep them alive when they retire.
[1:27:57.960 --> 1:27:58.960]  That's what I'm afraid of.
[1:27:58.960 --> 1:28:02.960]  That's what after talking to Harry Dent, I was depressed and upset.
[1:28:02.960 --> 1:28:07.960]  When we come back, we're going to get into your new book and other world events taking place.
[1:28:07.960 --> 1:28:10.960]  Robert Kiyosaki, Rich Dad Portat is our guest.
[1:28:10.960 --> 1:28:11.960]  You go to his website.

[1:28:17.960 --> 1:28:19.960]  I want to get him on every few months.
[1:28:19.960 --> 1:28:20.960]  And we'll also open the phones up.
[1:28:20.960 --> 1:28:21.960]  So stay with us.
[1:28:21.960 --> 1:28:25.960]  We'll be right back on the other side, 800-259-9231.
[1:28:25.960 --> 1:28:27.960]  We're on the march.
[1:28:27.960 --> 1:28:29.960]  The Empire's on the run.
[1:28:29.960 --> 1:28:32.960]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:28:59.960 --> 1:29:04.960]  Info Wars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.
[1:29:04.960 --> 1:29:06.960]  How we can come together and win the human race.

[1:29:36.960 --> 1:29:40.960]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[1:29:40.960 --> 1:29:44.960]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[1:29:44.960 --> 1:29:46.960]  Can you put two and two together?
[1:29:46.960 --> 1:29:51.960]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds.
[1:29:51.960 --> 1:29:54.960]  Is reasonably priced and fully legal.
[1:29:54.960 --> 1:30:02.960]  But for how long, go to infidelbodyarmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L body armor.com.

[1:30:06.960 --> 1:30:10.960]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[1:30:10.960 --> 1:30:15.960]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[1:30:15.960 --> 1:30:18.960]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[1:30:18.960 --> 1:30:23.960]  Just one of the key compounds, BiopQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[1:30:23.960 --> 1:30:26.960]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[1:31:18.960 --> 1:31:23.960]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful
[1:31:23.960 --> 1:31:25.960]  and most challenging to acquire.
[1:31:25.960 --> 1:31:31.960]  A true form of oil of oregano, now available in our limited first run at infowarslife.com.
[1:31:31.960 --> 1:31:56.960]  Or call 888-253-3139.
[1:32:01.960 --> 1:32:09.960]  I am going to be listening very carefully to what he has to say.
[1:32:09.960 --> 1:32:13.960]  I remember back when his first big book, he had other books, came out in the late 90s.
[1:32:13.960 --> 1:32:16.960]  My dad was like, you got to read this, you got to read this, you got to read this.
[1:32:16.960 --> 1:32:19.960]  My dad's been a pretty successful business smart guy.
[1:32:19.960 --> 1:32:23.960]  And so I read it and it just like, yeah, that makes sense.
[1:32:23.960 --> 1:32:24.960]  That makes sense.
[1:32:24.960 --> 1:32:29.960]  I had kind of instinctively already agreed with so much of it, but I did learn a lot.
[1:32:29.960 --> 1:32:31.960]  But I tell you, I can't wait to read his new book.
[1:32:31.960 --> 1:32:34.960]  I've read five or six of his books and they're excellent.
[1:32:34.960 --> 1:32:38.960]  I tuned in when I get a chance online to his radio show.
[1:32:38.960 --> 1:32:41.960]  You can find that on his website as well, richdad.com.
[1:32:41.960 --> 1:32:44.960]  And the reason I have other talk show hosts on my show is I don't care.
[1:32:44.960 --> 1:32:48.960]  I hope Robert has a billion listeners.
[1:32:48.960 --> 1:32:50.960]  I'm not some egomaniac.
[1:32:50.960 --> 1:32:51.960]  I know he's not as well.
[1:32:51.960 --> 1:32:52.960]  Towards Nori has me on.
[1:32:52.960 --> 1:32:54.960]  You know, he's got 16 million terrestrial listeners.
[1:32:54.960 --> 1:32:59.960]  I only have about five, six million terrestrial listeners altogether, about 20 million online
[1:32:59.960 --> 1:33:01.960]  and YouTube and the rest of it.
[1:33:01.960 --> 1:33:06.960]  But he has me on because he wants to try to save the country and have a free system.
[1:33:06.960 --> 1:33:10.960]  I mean, we're all kind of in the same mindset here.
[1:33:10.960 --> 1:33:15.960]  We're fellow travelers, not in the socialist way, but in the opposite way, a true capitalist way.
[1:33:15.960 --> 1:33:16.960]  So we got to stick together.
[1:33:16.960 --> 1:33:20.960]  So if you want to defeat the globalists, get his book, read it, give it to others.
[1:33:20.960 --> 1:33:27.960]  If you want to defeat the crony monopoly capitalists that are discrediting capitalism, get his book.
[1:33:27.960 --> 1:33:31.960]  Listen, socialism, once it comes in is so horrible, it always ends up getting reversed.
[1:33:31.960 --> 1:33:34.960]  So we've got a very good shot at beating this.
[1:33:34.960 --> 1:33:37.960]  The question is, can we beat it before we get really deep into it?
[1:33:37.960 --> 1:33:39.960]  And we're starting to get deep into it.
[1:33:39.960 --> 1:33:41.960]  So I hope you get his book.
[1:33:41.960 --> 1:33:44.960]  I hope you go to infowarslife.com to get our great nutraceuticals.
[1:33:44.960 --> 1:33:46.960]  Survival Shield, nascent iodine X2.
[1:33:46.960 --> 1:33:48.960]  It's not like any other iodine out there.
[1:33:48.960 --> 1:33:49.960]  Consult your physician.
[1:33:49.960 --> 1:33:50.960]  It's true iodine.
[1:33:50.960 --> 1:33:52.960]  I don't call it nascent so much.
[1:33:52.960 --> 1:33:56.960]  Because the other nascent brands out there, we've had them looked at, they're not really nascent.
[1:33:56.960 --> 1:34:00.960]  This is pure iodine, 99999, you know, just, just boom.
[1:34:00.960 --> 1:34:01.960]  I mean, it's not bound.
[1:34:01.960 --> 1:34:02.960]  It's not an alcohol.
[1:34:02.960 --> 1:34:04.960]  It's an organic palm oil.
[1:34:04.960 --> 1:34:08.960]  It's injected as a gas in a patented secret process that the Russians invented.
[1:34:08.960 --> 1:34:10.960]  It's life changing.
[1:34:10.960 --> 1:34:11.960]  It's the good halogen.
[1:34:11.960 --> 1:34:15.960]  Goes in, just pulls the garbage out, supercharges the energy.
[1:34:15.960 --> 1:34:21.960]  You use super male or super female vitality that we have discounted the month of February with it, 20% off.
[1:34:21.960 --> 1:34:25.960]  It's just, I don't know, what is it, like 18, 19 different concentrated herbs.
[1:34:25.960 --> 1:34:26.960]  The women's has a couple extra.
[1:34:26.960 --> 1:34:33.960]  That's why I get confused on the numbers that are just known to give you more vitality, energy in the gym, your libido.
[1:34:33.960 --> 1:34:36.960]  I mean, believe me, just try it.
[1:34:36.960 --> 1:34:37.960]  You'll be a repeat customer.
[1:34:37.960 --> 1:34:44.960]  And regardless, you're supporting the First Amendment and freedom and liberty and folks that promote the Second Amendment and sovereignty and family rights.
[1:34:44.960 --> 1:34:46.960]  And then property rights.
[1:34:46.960 --> 1:34:59.960]  So if the political class ever can be defeated, the insider political class, the crony class, it's when we, the people start voting with our dollars consciously.
[1:34:59.960 --> 1:35:02.960]  And it's starting to happen with organic food, you name it.
[1:35:02.960 --> 1:35:11.960]  And that's why it is an absolute essential that you buy the t-shirts, you buy the books, you buy the films and pass them on to others to wake them up, but also fund our operation.

[1:35:17.960 --> 1:35:25.960]  At the end of the day, money for me is about putting fuel in my truck so I can drive to the Grand Canyon and show my kids.
[1:35:25.960 --> 1:35:26.960]  It's not about I got money.
[1:35:26.960 --> 1:35:28.960]  Look, I'm waving around some hundred dollar bills.
[1:35:28.960 --> 1:35:36.960]  It's about I have freedom and I try to use the money we've made to build a platform to promote your freedom because we're in this together.
[1:35:36.960 --> 1:35:41.960]  We all hang together or hang separate, as Benjamin Franklin said.
[1:35:41.960 --> 1:35:50.960]  This is a critical time of change and the enemies trying to take over in this point, we can seize this opportunity and really change things for the better.
[1:35:50.960 --> 1:35:54.960]  There are times in history when more happens in a decade that happened in the previous hundred years.
[1:35:54.960 --> 1:35:56.960]  We're setting our future destinies right now.
[1:35:56.960 --> 1:36:03.960]  Every major economist, philosopher, historian agrees we're in a critical point right now, the beginning of it.
[1:36:03.960 --> 1:36:06.960]  The next five to ten years, I want to see if Robert agrees with me.
[1:36:06.960 --> 1:36:13.960]  And then we're going to go to some phone calls, 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[1:36:13.960 --> 1:36:18.960]  But it's so important now to tell Friends and Family about radio shows you like and pass it on.
[1:36:18.960 --> 1:36:20.960]  It's so important to promote other podcasts.
[1:36:20.960 --> 1:36:23.960]  It's so important to support our local affiliates and their sponsors.
[1:36:23.960 --> 1:36:30.960]  It's so important to buy the products because if we build it and you come, this will become the new pastime.
[1:36:30.960 --> 1:36:34.960]  If you want to expose an evil culture, become the new culture.
[1:36:34.960 --> 1:36:36.960]  Make art, compete.
[1:36:36.960 --> 1:36:42.960]  Our ideas are like snow cones in hell and they're selling flamethrowers in hell.
[1:36:42.960 --> 1:36:44.960]  People want to buy what we got.
[1:36:44.960 --> 1:36:47.960]  We're selling freedom for free, but we need the platform to put it out.
[1:36:47.960 --> 1:36:54.960]  So go to infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, check out the over 800 products on the site now.
[1:36:54.960 --> 1:37:00.960]  Most of it we can get, shortwave radios, t-shirts you name it, Made in America, some of it's not.
[1:37:00.960 --> 1:37:02.960]  At a lower price, we let you make the decision.
[1:37:02.960 --> 1:37:08.960]  infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[1:37:08.960 --> 1:37:14.960]  Again, second chance for your money, for your life, and for our world is the new book.
[1:37:14.960 --> 1:37:17.960]  And he is joining us right now.
[1:37:17.960 --> 1:37:21.960]  It's eight lessons in military leadership for entrepreneurs.
[1:37:21.960 --> 1:37:24.960]  I want you to talk about your book and any other issues you want to get to.
[1:37:24.960 --> 1:37:27.960]  And then I want to take a few phone calls, Robert.
[1:37:27.960 --> 1:37:33.960]  Yeah, first of all, eight lessons of military leadership is a book coming out in a couple of months.
[1:37:33.960 --> 1:37:35.960]  Well, I can't wait to read that one too.
[1:37:35.960 --> 1:37:36.960]  Yeah.
[1:37:36.960 --> 1:37:43.960]  And second chance is about where we are today and people may need to change some of the things we're doing.
[1:37:43.960 --> 1:37:47.960]  If I could mention second chance, if I show it up to you.
[1:37:47.960 --> 1:37:53.960]  I love what you do because you give people like me, people with a different point of view, a chance to speak,
[1:37:53.960 --> 1:37:58.960]  versus what happens on television a lot of times, they'll put one person with one point of view,
[1:37:58.960 --> 1:38:01.960]  and a person with another point of view, and they yell at each other.
[1:38:01.960 --> 1:38:03.960]  And we learn nothing.
[1:38:03.960 --> 1:38:07.960]  The plan is to teach us how to fight with each other and never actually come together.
[1:38:07.960 --> 1:38:08.960]  Yeah.
[1:38:08.960 --> 1:38:10.960]  So I appreciate what you do, and I agree with you.
[1:38:10.960 --> 1:38:12.960]  You know, cash is only one thing.
[1:38:12.960 --> 1:38:19.960]  Put fuel in your tank and keep your business going, keep your programs going and support, you know, people and messages you like.
[1:38:19.960 --> 1:38:21.960]  So I agree wholeheartedly with you.
[1:38:21.960 --> 1:38:25.960]  The reason I wrote second chance is because of all the confusion.
[1:38:25.960 --> 1:38:33.960]  So if I could be bold and show you a picture from the book here, what you'll see here are pictures.
[1:38:33.960 --> 1:38:41.960]  And although it's a very big book, the reason I made it in pictures is so that you didn't have to listen to the people yelling back and forth.
[1:38:41.960 --> 1:38:47.960]  Also, what happens for many people is when they read economic terms, they get confused.
[1:38:47.960 --> 1:38:51.960]  So second chance, part one especially, is everything's in pictures.
[1:38:51.960 --> 1:39:01.960]  So a 10-year-old kid could read it, an adult could read it, and the best thing about it is parent and adult or old guys and young guys could discuss the pictures
[1:39:01.960 --> 1:39:07.960]  rather than get confused from all the economic jargon that's thrown out there like,
[1:39:07.960 --> 1:39:11.960]  what is the GDP versus NDA and all this stuff.
[1:39:11.960 --> 1:39:12.960]  It's just pictures.
[1:39:12.960 --> 1:39:22.960]  So when you have a second chance about pictures, you can explain to your family or kids by pointing, because your kids will probably not read it, but they can see the pictures.
[1:39:22.960 --> 1:39:24.960]  I think that's what makes the book differently.
[1:39:24.960 --> 1:39:26.960]  I'm not pushing an agenda.
[1:39:26.960 --> 1:39:35.960]  When you see, like I said in 1971, I had 72 when I was in Vietnam, you know, I went, oh my God, I better wake up.
[1:39:35.960 --> 1:39:37.960]  You know, something's happening here.
[1:39:37.960 --> 1:39:40.960]  That's when Nixon took us off the gold standard.
[1:39:40.960 --> 1:39:45.960]  And if you know what happened, we started printing and the biggest boom in history ever took off.
[1:39:45.960 --> 1:39:50.960]  We have never been this high, 17,000 Dow, than in 1978.
[1:39:50.960 --> 1:39:53.960]  This was all in pictures in second chance.
[1:39:53.960 --> 1:39:56.960]  In 1978, the 401K came out.
[1:39:56.960 --> 1:40:03.960]  And basically what that was, the 401K was, there were big corporations were saying to the little employees,
[1:40:03.960 --> 1:40:05.960]  hey, you're on your own, dude.
[1:40:05.960 --> 1:40:09.960]  You know, if you run out of money when you retire, there's no longer our problem.
[1:40:09.960 --> 1:40:21.960]  So when you see the 401K from that perspective, like the other side of the coin, and you look at the pictures, then you can start making different decisions for you, your family and your life.
[1:40:21.960 --> 1:40:27.960]  What do you make about the big banking cartels worldwide and now they're floating in here at the State of the Union?
[1:40:27.960 --> 1:40:40.960]  The government quote, taking over private 401Ks and education 401Ks to quote, protect them, but throwing in class envy that these are, you know, lazy trust fund kids on the average things like $25,000.
[1:40:40.960 --> 1:40:45.960]  I mean, that's really scary when they start sniffing around the pension funds, the private pension funds.
[1:40:45.960 --> 1:40:47.960]  And that's what we're talking about here.
[1:40:47.960 --> 1:40:48.960]  And healthcare.
[1:40:48.960 --> 1:40:49.960]  Yeah.
[1:40:49.960 --> 1:40:52.960]  The whole thing, you talked about socialism versus capitalism.
[1:40:52.960 --> 1:40:54.960]  You know, I was a Marine.
[1:40:54.960 --> 1:40:56.960]  I fought for capitalism.
[1:40:56.960 --> 1:40:57.960]  I fought for socialism.
[1:40:57.960 --> 1:41:03.960]  You know, when people said what happened to the American dream, the American dream has gone to the entitlement mentality.
[1:41:03.960 --> 1:41:09.960]  And I look at all our senators and Congress and presidents, they all expect the government to take care of them.
[1:41:09.960 --> 1:41:18.960]  And what's going to happen if I'm correct in 2016 and the whole stock market house of cards comes down.
[1:41:18.960 --> 1:41:26.960]  That means everybody who's counting on the government or the IRA or the 401K, they may be up the creek without a pedal.
[1:41:26.960 --> 1:41:30.960]  So that's why I started the Rich Dad Company back in 1997.
[1:41:30.960 --> 1:41:31.960]  What do you recommend?
[1:41:31.960 --> 1:41:33.960]  I can't wait because I haven't bought your book yet.
[1:41:33.960 --> 1:41:34.960]  I'm going to buy it.
[1:41:34.960 --> 1:41:35.960]  I'm going to read it because I need to get my act together.
[1:41:35.960 --> 1:41:37.960]  I mean, I'm always learning more.
[1:41:37.960 --> 1:41:43.960]  I can't wait though till the other book comes out, eight lessons of military leadership for entrepreneurs.
[1:41:43.960 --> 1:41:46.960]  Give us a sneak peek on that.
[1:41:46.960 --> 1:41:51.960]  Well, it's about, you know, we have a high number of veterans who are unemployed.
[1:41:51.960 --> 1:41:54.960]  I mean, they're homeless, a lot of them.
[1:41:54.960 --> 1:42:00.960]  What I'm saying is that the military gave them some of the best training to become entrepreneurs, not employees.
[1:42:00.960 --> 1:42:06.960]  And they, you know, they gave them such things as, you know, unity, courage, initiative skills.
[1:42:06.960 --> 1:42:14.960]  And so most of our veterans are actually natural entrepreneurs, except when they come back from the war, they're trying to fit into the corporate world.
[1:42:14.960 --> 1:42:16.960]  A lot of them just don't fit.
[1:42:16.960 --> 1:42:29.960]  So eight lessons for military leadership is about how every military person from the lowest private to the general are already good entrepreneurs because they have great training.
[1:42:29.960 --> 1:42:32.960]  Flesh out a bit that I want to take some calls because it is fascinating.
[1:42:32.960 --> 1:42:36.960]  I found vets do real good in my operation because I just say, here's the mission.
[1:42:36.960 --> 1:42:39.960]  Have integrity, you know, report news.
[1:42:39.960 --> 1:42:41.960]  Have an open bias of telling the truth.
[1:42:41.960 --> 1:42:44.960]  And from a perspective of freedom, get out there.
[1:42:44.960 --> 1:42:46.960]  We want people to really dominate and break big stories.
[1:42:46.960 --> 1:42:49.960]  And I found people like Joe Biggs, they just get out there, they get it.
[1:42:49.960 --> 1:42:50.960]  They have a mission.
[1:42:50.960 --> 1:42:51.960]  I turn them loose.
[1:42:51.960 --> 1:42:52.960]  Yeah.
[1:42:52.960 --> 1:42:56.960]  Like when I was, you know, as a Marine pilot flew the helicopter gunship.
[1:42:56.960 --> 1:43:01.960]  And if my major came down to me and says, hey, Lieutenant, take out that machine gun.
[1:43:01.960 --> 1:43:03.960]  You didn't say, well, I don't feel like it.
[1:43:03.960 --> 1:43:09.960]  I mean, he just, you did it or died.
[1:43:09.960 --> 1:43:13.960]  I mean, that is how Marines and most military people are trained.
[1:43:13.960 --> 1:43:14.960]  What type of gunship?
[1:43:14.960 --> 1:43:16.960]  Was it a Cobra or what was it?
[1:43:16.960 --> 1:43:18.960]  Well, I thought the Huey gunship and the Cobra gunship.
[1:43:18.960 --> 1:43:19.960]  Wow.
[1:43:19.960 --> 1:43:20.960]  I'd like to have you on about that.
[1:43:20.960 --> 1:43:21.960]  I loved it.
[1:43:21.960 --> 1:43:23.960]  I really loved it.
[1:43:23.960 --> 1:43:29.960]  But anyway, that's why military personnel are all are trained to be entrepreneurs.
[1:43:29.960 --> 1:43:31.960]  They get the job done.
[1:43:31.960 --> 1:43:35.960]  And that's why the Marines had so much problems in Fallujah.
[1:43:35.960 --> 1:43:40.960]  Not to, not to berate my brother in the army, but the army Marines took Fallujah and then
[1:43:40.960 --> 1:43:41.960]  the army went back in.
[1:43:41.960 --> 1:43:43.960]  They lost it and Marines went back in.
[1:43:43.960 --> 1:43:48.960]  A lot of my friends were brought up on court martial because they did the job.
[1:43:48.960 --> 1:43:49.960]  They killed people.
[1:43:49.960 --> 1:43:53.960]  And I hate to say that, but that's what Marines are trained to do.
[1:43:53.960 --> 1:43:54.960]  Yeah.
[1:43:54.960 --> 1:43:55.960]  What about political correctness in the military?
[1:43:55.960 --> 1:44:00.960]  I mean, you know, I'm against those wars, but once they're there, you know, they're
[1:44:00.960 --> 1:44:03.960]  going to court martial people because they are getting shot at from a house.
[1:44:03.960 --> 1:44:06.960]  They shoot the house up and then they shoot a civilian.
[1:44:06.960 --> 1:44:08.960]  You can't blame the individual in my view.
[1:44:08.960 --> 1:44:09.960]  I'm sorry.
[1:44:09.960 --> 1:44:10.960]  It's disgusting.
[1:44:10.960 --> 1:44:15.960]  My friend is a three star general and he has to be politically correct.
[1:44:15.960 --> 1:44:16.960]  He's my roommate in Vietnam.
[1:44:16.960 --> 1:44:22.960]  And he says, I cannot say what I want to say because it looks bad upon the Marine Corps.
[1:44:22.960 --> 1:44:29.960]  And when, when your generals are not allowed to speak, we have a serious political correctness
[1:44:29.960 --> 1:44:30.960]  problem.
[1:44:30.960 --> 1:44:33.960]  That's sad.
[1:44:33.960 --> 1:44:35.960]  Look, ISIS is actually doing us a big favor right now.
[1:44:35.960 --> 1:44:37.960]  They're really upsetting the whole world.
[1:44:37.960 --> 1:44:41.960]  You know, they, if they actually put on video, then be heading a little kid, the world would
[1:44:41.960 --> 1:44:43.960]  come and blow them out of the water.
[1:44:43.960 --> 1:44:45.960]  But right now they're only be heading men.
[1:44:45.960 --> 1:44:51.960]  But when they start be heading women and kids, I think then the Marine Corps will step up.
[1:44:51.960 --> 1:44:52.960]  Well, they're doing it.
[1:44:52.960 --> 1:44:53.960]  They're just smart enough not to put it on video.
[1:44:53.960 --> 1:44:56.960]  And I tell you, what a despicable group of dirt bags.
[1:44:56.960 --> 1:44:59.960]  I mean, those people are just unbelievable.
[1:44:59.960 --> 1:45:02.960]  You look at the eyes of those people, they just look like a bunch of Charles Mansons.
[1:45:02.960 --> 1:45:06.960]  I don't know how you can find such large groups of people that have a Charlie Manson look
[1:45:06.960 --> 1:45:07.960]  in their eye all the time.
[1:45:07.960 --> 1:45:10.960]  I mean, all the people I know that look like that are on PCP.
[1:45:10.960 --> 1:45:13.960]  Robert, what do you think is going on with these people?
[1:45:13.960 --> 1:45:15.960]  Alex, I have no idea.
[1:45:15.960 --> 1:45:19.960]  Look, you know, I have, I have had a good friend who is Muslim.
[1:45:19.960 --> 1:45:22.960]  I never met a man who hated so much.
[1:45:22.960 --> 1:45:24.960]  He's a good friend, but he hated Jews.
[1:45:24.960 --> 1:45:29.960]  And I kept asking him, I said, Sally, how in the world can you hate somebody that much?
[1:45:29.960 --> 1:45:33.960]  You know, because I hate, but I don't hate that much.
[1:45:33.960 --> 1:45:38.960]  And that's the question is, how could you go and do basically atrocities to your fellow
[1:45:38.960 --> 1:45:43.960]  human being and think you're doing the name of God is beyond my comprehension.
[1:45:43.960 --> 1:45:48.960]  So that's why I think we need to be stronger, but we also take different approaches and
[1:45:48.960 --> 1:45:50.960]  neutralize this ISIS threat.
[1:45:50.960 --> 1:45:55.960]  Well, of course, you know, the West helped set up ISIS to take out Syria.
[1:45:55.960 --> 1:45:56.960]  Now it's come back.
[1:45:56.960 --> 1:45:58.960]  It is a mess.
[1:45:58.960 --> 1:46:00.960]  You ready to take some phone calls, Robert?
[1:46:00.960 --> 1:46:01.960]  Sure.
[1:46:01.960 --> 1:46:02.960]  Let's do it.
[1:46:02.960 --> 1:46:08.960]  Mike in Virginia, you're on the air with our guest, the author of the new book, Second Chance.
[1:46:08.960 --> 1:46:09.960]  Go ahead.
[1:46:09.960 --> 1:46:10.960]  Yeah.
[1:46:10.960 --> 1:46:13.960]  First of all, I can't believe I got off.
[1:46:13.960 --> 1:46:15.960]  But anyway, yeah, I have a question.
[1:46:15.960 --> 1:46:16.960]  I have some silver.
[1:46:16.960 --> 1:46:17.960]  I have some gold.
[1:46:17.960 --> 1:46:18.960]  I got a lot of silver.
[1:46:18.960 --> 1:46:20.960]  So let's put it that way.
[1:46:20.960 --> 1:46:24.960]  And some gold, my house has been paid for years ago, 20 years ago.
[1:46:24.960 --> 1:46:26.960]  What else can I do to help protect?
[1:46:26.960 --> 1:46:28.960]  You know what I mean?
[1:46:28.960 --> 1:46:30.960]  That's a great question.
[1:46:30.960 --> 1:46:32.960]  You know, congratulations for having silver.
[1:46:32.960 --> 1:46:33.960]  I like silver personally.
[1:46:33.960 --> 1:46:34.960]  I love gold.
[1:46:34.960 --> 1:46:36.960]  I have a lot of gold and silver.
[1:46:36.960 --> 1:46:40.960]  And the difference is between your philosophy and my philosophy is I like debt.
[1:46:40.960 --> 1:46:47.960]  You see, the reason I teach people how to use debt is because debt is the new money.
[1:46:47.960 --> 1:46:51.960]  It happened after 1971 when Nixon took the dollar off the gold standard.
[1:46:51.960 --> 1:46:53.960]  The dollar became debt.
[1:46:53.960 --> 1:46:58.960]  And so when the financial pundits are telling the poor middle class to get out of debt, what
[1:46:58.960 --> 1:47:00.960]  they're rich are doing is using debt.
[1:47:00.960 --> 1:47:01.960]  Ask your banker this question.
[1:47:01.960 --> 1:47:06.960]  Does the banker want your savings or does he want you to borrow millions of dollars from
[1:47:06.960 --> 1:47:07.960]  it?
[1:47:07.960 --> 1:47:08.960]  And this is simple, but it's also complex.
[1:47:08.960 --> 1:47:09.960]  There's different philosophies.
[1:47:09.960 --> 1:47:13.960]  I would either go with the pay for your house, but get one or the good bargain, stay in it
[1:47:13.960 --> 1:47:19.960]  forever, and then run entrepreneurial businesses and do things like that and come up with new
[1:47:19.960 --> 1:47:20.960]  products.
[1:47:20.960 --> 1:47:25.120]  Or you can go with the whole debt model and businesses, but you've got to be smart, pretty
[1:47:25.120 --> 1:47:27.200]  darn smart to go with your model.
[1:47:27.200 --> 1:47:30.460]  I think that's the only problem with your model, Robert, is that if you know what you're
[1:47:30.460 --> 1:47:31.960]  doing, it's the best model.
[1:47:31.960 --> 1:47:37.560]  It's what the insiders use, but the general public is going to get basically screwed over
[1:47:37.560 --> 1:47:40.240]  because they're not going to actually follow what you say.
[1:47:40.240 --> 1:47:41.960]  Try to explain it to people.
[1:47:41.960 --> 1:47:46.960]  Well, amen, you said, if you don't have any financial education, don't do what I do.
[1:47:46.960 --> 1:47:51.460]  And the reason I wrote second chance, I got some three parts, the past, the present and
[1:47:51.460 --> 1:47:52.460]  the future.
[1:47:52.460 --> 1:47:56.760]  And again, there's pictures throughout the same whole thing so that your kids can understand
[1:47:56.760 --> 1:47:57.760]  it.
[1:47:57.760 --> 1:47:59.960]  But what you do is up to you.
[1:47:59.960 --> 1:48:04.960]  I learned my financial education began with my rich dad, who's my best friend's father,
[1:48:04.960 --> 1:48:07.960]  at age nine teaching me to play Monopoly.
[1:48:07.960 --> 1:48:12.960]  And for about 30 years, we played Monopoly, you know, adults, and today as an adult, I
[1:48:12.960 --> 1:48:18.760]  play Monopoly as an adult, you know, for the formulas for greenhouses, one red hotel.
[1:48:18.760 --> 1:48:24.000]  So in 2007, when the markets crashed, unfortunately, millions were losing everything.
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:28.500]  Guys like me were going to the very banks that set up the crash and saying, would you
[1:48:28.500 --> 1:48:30.960]  give me a couple of million dollars to go do this?
[1:48:30.960 --> 1:48:37.400]  You see, what I'm saying in second chance is that all coins have three sides, heads,
[1:48:37.400 --> 1:48:43.480]  tails in the middle, and in the middle, which is intelligence, to stand on the edge is intelligent.
[1:48:43.480 --> 1:48:48.560]  And what you're saying, I agree exactly with you, is be intelligent, hear what I'm saying,
[1:48:48.560 --> 1:48:53.300]  hear what you're saying, but ultimately it's up to you, a guy on the edge that has to make
[1:48:53.300 --> 1:48:54.300]  up their own mind.
[1:48:54.300 --> 1:48:55.800]  I made up my mind a long time ago.
[1:48:55.800 --> 1:48:56.800]  That's right.
[1:48:56.800 --> 1:48:58.720]  I mean, the real fortune is in the arena.
[1:48:58.720 --> 1:49:03.680]  Fortune favors the bull to quote British SAS, but if you're going to get in the arena,
[1:49:03.680 --> 1:49:04.680]  you better be ready.
[1:49:04.680 --> 1:49:05.680]  That's right.
[1:49:05.680 --> 1:49:08.440]  I didn't go to Vietnam after one day.
[1:49:08.440 --> 1:49:13.520]  I spent two years practicing out at camp out and shooting rockets and machine guns at
[1:49:13.520 --> 1:49:14.520]  dummies.
[1:49:14.520 --> 1:49:17.760]  And then I went a few months later, I was in the real place.
[1:49:17.760 --> 1:49:18.760]  So you got to practice.
[1:49:18.760 --> 1:49:20.920]  That's one of my big complaints about school.
[1:49:20.920 --> 1:49:21.920]  That's silly.
[1:49:21.920 --> 1:49:22.920]  I sing schools too.
[1:49:22.920 --> 1:49:24.320]  They punish you for making mistakes.
[1:49:24.320 --> 1:49:27.160]  Well, how in the world do you learn anything if you make mistakes?
[1:49:27.160 --> 1:49:29.320]  You know, how does the baby learn to walk?
[1:49:29.320 --> 1:49:30.320]  Absolutely.
[1:49:30.320 --> 1:49:31.320]  Got a war game, everything.
[1:49:31.320 --> 1:49:38.320]  Robert Kiyosaki is our guest today with us more calls straight ahead.
[1:50:01.320 --> 1:50:08.320]  That's 800-686-2237.
[1:50:31.320 --> 1:50:37.080]  S-N-A-P-F-O-R-C-E dot com, snapfors.com.
[1:50:37.080 --> 1:50:41.480]  Healthy elimination is essential to high energy, a cheerful mood, and prevention of disease.
[1:50:41.480 --> 1:50:45.160]  Some of the founders of our modern holistic health thinking state that disease begins
[1:50:45.160 --> 1:50:46.160]  in a toxic colon.
[1:50:46.160 --> 1:50:50.320]  A toxic intestinal tract is the foundation for virtually all degenerative disease.
[1:50:50.320 --> 1:50:53.880]  And a clean and well-moving intestinal tract is the foundation of health.
[1:50:53.880 --> 1:50:56.520]  I just want to say that you folks have an amazing product.
[1:50:56.520 --> 1:51:00.440]  I've taken whey protein products for years, and I've never noticed results I have with
[1:51:00.440 --> 1:51:01.440]  your product.
[1:51:01.440 --> 1:51:04.440]  I've suffered with thought and contemplation most of my life.
[1:51:04.440 --> 1:51:08.240]  Within a few days of taking one whey away, I noticed a dramatic change.
[1:51:08.240 --> 1:51:12.400]  Also, in the past few years, I've experienced symptoms associated with diabetes.
[1:51:12.400 --> 1:51:16.080]  I feel horrible when I've had too much sugar, and I've been getting the foot pain as well.
[1:51:16.080 --> 1:51:19.520]  But I've noticed in the past week or so, I'm not feeling bad anymore, and the foot pain
[1:51:19.520 --> 1:51:20.520]  is gone.
[1:51:20.520 --> 1:51:24.040]  I'm just finishing up the five pound top I ordered and just got off the phone ordering
[1:51:24.040 --> 1:51:25.040]  more.
[1:51:25.040 --> 1:51:26.040]  I love your product.
[1:51:26.040 --> 1:51:27.040]  Thank you.
[1:51:27.040 --> 1:51:28.040]  Call 888-988-3325.
[1:51:28.040 --> 1:51:29.040]  That's 888-988-3325.

[1:51:36.120 --> 1:51:41.480]  As the New World Order continues to tighten its grip on every facet of life in this country,
[1:51:41.480 --> 1:51:46.240]  we're all asking ourselves, how can we maintain our independence?
[1:51:46.240 --> 1:51:50.240]  The answer is, get prepared and get prepared now.
[1:51:50.240 --> 1:51:53.720]  My Patriot supply has the deal to get you started.

[1:52:09.000 --> 1:52:10.400]  for anything.
[1:52:10.400 --> 1:52:15.560]  Having an emergency food supply is an important first step to making sure you'll never surrender
[1:52:15.560 --> 1:52:17.120]  to FEMA's control.
[1:52:17.120 --> 1:52:25.840]  Call 1-800-274-3070 to get your emergency food supply for only $10 including free shipping.

[1:52:39.240 --> 1:52:40.240]  Alex Jones here back live.
[1:52:40.240 --> 1:52:44.000]  We've got six minutes in this segment, five minutes after that and then our guest has
[1:52:44.000 --> 1:52:45.000]  got to leave us.
[1:52:45.000 --> 1:52:48.840]  We've got two endocrine disruptors on record and household items and a big way to boost
[1:52:48.840 --> 1:52:53.240]  your health with Dr. Edward Grip coming up and other news in the next hour.
[1:52:53.240 --> 1:52:59.720]  Lot of key news breaking at infowars.com that I have not gotten to, stuff like elderly
[1:52:59.720 --> 1:53:06.120]  man facing 10 years over unloaded flintlock pistol, that's just an amazing story, walking
[1:53:06.120 --> 1:53:16.320]  while Jew, what they're not telling you and if people attacking Jews in Europe get political
[1:53:16.320 --> 1:53:22.280]  support or now this sit in black lives matter where black folks go in and kind of rough
[1:53:22.280 --> 1:53:26.760]  up and get in white people's faces, this is just racism being promoted and it's more
[1:53:26.760 --> 1:53:27.760]  divided in Congress.
[1:53:27.760 --> 1:53:29.560]  We should all just come together for freedom.
[1:53:29.560 --> 1:53:34.960]  I know it's a liberal cause to love to hate Jews, but it's just, it's going nowhere and
[1:53:34.960 --> 1:53:39.040]  the globalists are promoting it and I assure you, every Jew on the face of the earth has
[1:53:39.040 --> 1:53:41.840]  teleported to the moon, we would still have major problems.
[1:53:41.840 --> 1:53:47.760]  So it's an scapegoat, it's an excuse and it's sick and that's all I have to say on
[1:53:47.760 --> 1:53:48.760]  the subject.
[1:53:48.760 --> 1:53:52.800]  We're going back to our guest, richdad.com, Robert Kiyosaki.
[1:53:52.800 --> 1:53:57.400]  Let's go ahead and go to Chris in Washington and Vincent, Bubba, John, Eric and others.
[1:53:57.400 --> 1:53:59.200]  Chris, your question for Robert.
[1:53:59.200 --> 1:54:06.280]  Yeah, my question is, I lost a job of 12 years, turned the 401k into an IRA Roth and a credit
[1:54:06.280 --> 1:54:10.400]  union and I'm wondering if that's really a safer place to put it.
[1:54:10.400 --> 1:54:15.000]  I also have recently put it into my wife's name, so she's a Japanese national, I could
[1:54:15.000 --> 1:54:20.240]  wire it to Japan, but I'm wondering if those counts would be frozen would even keep me from
[1:54:20.240 --> 1:54:22.680]  wiring funds internationally.
[1:54:22.680 --> 1:54:27.200]  And is the 401k Roth because it's a credit union making it more safe?
[1:54:27.200 --> 1:54:32.560]  Again, I'm going to say all coins at three sites, heads, tails and the edge, I don't
[1:54:32.560 --> 1:54:38.200]  have an IRA, I don't have a 401k and I don't have a Roth, simply because my rich dad taught
[1:54:38.200 --> 1:54:42.320]  me how to manage my money without the control of the government.
[1:54:42.320 --> 1:54:49.600]  See the 401k and the Roth IRA are government vehicles basically and they're doing their
[1:54:49.600 --> 1:54:54.720]  best to get the poor and middle class to do something for the retirement.
[1:54:54.720 --> 1:54:59.080]  Now that's good for most people, I wouldn't do it, I'm concerned about them because the
[1:54:59.080 --> 1:55:04.880]  market's at all time tops, so what you, like I've always said, what you do is up to you
[1:55:04.880 --> 1:55:06.840]  and what I do is what I can do.
[1:55:06.840 --> 1:55:10.720]  For example, if Mark Zuckerberg called me right now and says, hey, why don't you start
[1:55:10.720 --> 1:55:11.720]  Facebook?
[1:55:11.720 --> 1:55:17.840]  You know, I can't even use my cell phone much less, you know, create a...
[1:55:17.840 --> 1:55:21.200]  So you've got to financially be involved in what you know?
[1:55:21.200 --> 1:55:22.200]  Yeah.
[1:55:22.200 --> 1:55:25.240]  And what your experiences are and all this like, you know, a farmer would do something
[1:55:25.240 --> 1:55:28.960]  different, you know, a secretary would do something different, a doctor would do something
[1:55:28.960 --> 1:55:29.960]  different.
[1:55:29.960 --> 1:55:34.960]  But what, and I'm not against them, what the big banks have trained us to do is go to
[1:55:34.960 --> 1:55:39.640]  school but they give us no financial education, save money, which means give their money
[1:55:39.640 --> 1:55:45.880]  to the bank, you know, pay your taxes, get out of debt and invest for the long term in
[1:55:45.880 --> 1:55:47.080]  the stock market.
[1:55:47.080 --> 1:55:50.000]  I don't do that and that's what second chance is about.
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:54.000]  Because you can't put all your eggs in one basket, Chris, but I mean, obviously, what
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:56.360]  do you think of his idea of getting money out of the country?
[1:55:56.360 --> 1:56:02.600]  Yeah, he better talk to an attorney because as much they're cracking down very, very
[1:56:02.600 --> 1:56:03.600]  hard.
[1:56:03.600 --> 1:56:04.600]  That's right.
[1:56:04.600 --> 1:56:09.040]  I talked to a lot of famous people that left the country years ago and they...
[1:56:09.040 --> 1:56:11.600]  They're cracking down so hard right now.
[1:56:11.600 --> 1:56:16.080]  If you do anything, even smells illegal, you're in trouble.
[1:56:16.080 --> 1:56:17.960]  So you've really got to have good...
[1:56:17.960 --> 1:56:20.000]  Unless you're any legal alien, then you're above the law.
[1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:21.000]  Thank you so much.
[1:56:21.000 --> 1:56:24.000]  Let's go to Vincent, North Carolina, you're on the air.
[1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:28.160]  Thanks for having me.
[1:56:28.160 --> 1:56:32.800]  I guess probably what I just need to do is get the book.
[1:56:32.800 --> 1:56:40.800]  Mr. Kiyosaki, I had purchased one of your Rich Dad programs, which teaches how to get
[1:56:40.800 --> 1:56:48.560]  into real estate and investing and about that time, which was shortly before I think the
[1:56:48.560 --> 1:56:56.440]  last time you were on Alex's program, I was seriously looking into that and then I realized
[1:56:56.440 --> 1:57:04.120]  that the housing market was really going down, that it may be difficult for somebody to get
[1:57:04.120 --> 1:57:07.440]  into renting properties and things like that.
[1:57:07.440 --> 1:57:08.440]  Hold on, Vincent.
[1:57:08.440 --> 1:57:09.440]  I'm going to hold you over.
[1:57:09.440 --> 1:57:11.800]  I'll be back in 70 seconds with Robert Kiyosaki.
[1:57:11.800 --> 1:57:14.200]  I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com.
[1:57:14.200 --> 1:57:15.200]  Don't hang up, Vincent.
[1:57:15.200 --> 1:57:16.200]  I want you to finish the question.
[1:57:16.200 --> 1:57:21.200]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[1:57:57.120 --> 1:58:00.800]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[1:58:00.800 --> 1:58:05.160]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[1:58:05.160 --> 1:58:07.160]  Can you put two and two together?
[1:58:07.160 --> 1:58:12.760]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds, is reasonably
[1:58:12.760 --> 1:58:14.760]  priced and fully legal.
[1:58:14.760 --> 1:58:15.760]  But for how long?

[1:58:43.280 --> 1:58:48.080]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[1:58:48.080 --> 1:58:49.080]  You want answers?
[1:58:49.080 --> 1:58:50.880]  Well, so does he.
[1:58:50.880 --> 1:58:55.400]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:58:55.400 --> 1:59:00.360]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:59:00.360 --> 1:59:05.880]  Robert Kiyosaki has also co-authored two books with Donald Trump, and a third Trump book
[1:59:05.880 --> 1:59:08.080]  for 2016 is being developed.
[1:59:08.080 --> 1:59:13.320]  When you get him on retainly when these books come out, we want to jam in a few more questions
[1:59:13.320 --> 1:59:15.840]  or comments here with the callers.
[1:59:15.840 --> 1:59:20.200]  And listen, I can have a Harry Dent on who disagrees with Golden Silver and then have
[1:59:20.200 --> 1:59:22.760]  a Kiyosaki on that agrees with it.
[1:59:22.760 --> 1:59:24.280]  I can have a Jim Rogers on.
[1:59:24.280 --> 1:59:29.640]  I can have a, I mean, we're giving you different perspectives, but from basically an honest
[1:59:29.640 --> 1:59:32.440]  perspective about how stuff's rigged at the top.
[1:59:32.440 --> 1:59:36.920]  And the only way to survive is to know how things are rigged and basically play off of
[1:59:36.920 --> 1:59:38.120]  that while you expose it.
[1:59:38.120 --> 1:59:39.840]  I think that's what we're getting at here today.
[1:59:39.840 --> 1:59:44.360]  But Vincent, specifically, finishing up your question, you were going to do real estate,
[1:59:44.360 --> 1:59:45.880]  but you saw what was happening in it.
[1:59:45.880 --> 1:59:47.760]  Go ahead, your question.
[1:59:47.760 --> 1:59:56.320]  I guess my, the thing that became problematic to me is how does a person succeed in a business
[1:59:56.320 --> 2:00:03.560]  or in real estate if so many people are living off of subsidies and things like that and jobs
[2:00:03.560 --> 2:00:05.560]  are just kind of vanishing.
[2:00:05.560 --> 2:00:11.680]  I've noticed a lot of people, a lot of businesses here where I live just closed down.
[2:00:11.680 --> 2:00:15.080]  Well, that's one thing about real estate is you got to be in the right area and be investing
[2:00:15.080 --> 2:00:16.080]  in it.
[2:00:16.080 --> 2:00:17.080]  A good question, Vincent.
[2:00:17.080 --> 2:00:19.440]  Robert, when is the right time to invest in real estate?
[2:00:19.440 --> 2:00:24.240]  Well, the first thing is I've been in real estate probably 45 years and I started back
[2:00:24.240 --> 2:00:27.640]  in 1973, I believe.
[2:00:27.640 --> 2:00:31.960]  I took a little infomercial class, you know, $385 and I learned how to buy real estate for
[2:00:31.960 --> 2:00:32.960]  nothing down.
[2:00:32.960 --> 2:00:37.840]  But as the instructor said to my little class, I was a solar marine, he says, your education
[2:00:37.840 --> 2:00:39.400]  begins when you leave the class.
[2:00:39.400 --> 2:00:41.280]  You have to go out and practice.
[2:00:41.280 --> 2:00:46.320]  So I went out, his instruction was each person in the class had to go look at 100 properties,
[2:00:46.320 --> 2:00:50.840]  not buy anything, but write an evaluation of it and then buy something.
[2:00:50.840 --> 2:00:54.240]  Unfortunately, what our schools teach you is don't make mistakes.
[2:00:54.240 --> 2:00:59.680]  And so most people don't want to go through that process of looking at 100 properties,
[2:00:59.680 --> 2:01:03.640]  making a lot of mistakes, being stupid all the time, and then finally the light's going
[2:01:03.640 --> 2:01:04.880]  on your head.
[2:01:04.880 --> 2:01:10.040]  If you're going to do real estate, stocks, bonds, currencies, goldfish, whatever you want
[2:01:10.040 --> 2:01:13.320]  to do, you have to go through that process of making decisions.
[2:01:13.320 --> 2:01:17.000]  Absolutely, you've got to lose to know how to win, to quote Aerosmith.
[2:01:17.000 --> 2:01:19.720]  Well, you've got to make mistakes to learn.
[2:01:19.720 --> 2:01:24.160]  And that's why my poor dad, like I said, a PhD, head of education in the state of Hawaii,
[2:01:24.160 --> 2:01:26.520]  graduated from college in less than two years.
[2:01:26.520 --> 2:01:30.400]  The reason he was not successful was because he never made any mistakes.
[2:01:30.400 --> 2:01:34.840]  So when he got fired from his job as head of education for the state of Hawaii, after
[2:01:34.840 --> 2:01:39.440]  running for a candidate for lieutenant governor as a Republican in the Communist Republic
[2:01:39.440 --> 2:01:41.960]  of Hawaii, he couldn't work.
[2:01:41.960 --> 2:01:43.120]  He didn't know what to do.
[2:01:43.120 --> 2:01:46.440]  A serious guy, a PhD, is unemployed at age 50.
[2:01:46.440 --> 2:01:50.520]  And that's the monopoly cult system versus the free market and the cult systems taking
[2:01:50.520 --> 2:01:51.520]  over, folks.
[2:01:51.520 --> 2:01:53.720]  John, in Texas, you're on the air.
[2:01:53.720 --> 2:01:54.720]  Go ahead.
[2:01:54.720 --> 2:02:01.040]  You know, Alex, I was in high school back when Nixon took us off the gold standard.
[2:02:01.040 --> 2:02:06.120]  And the first thing I noticed through the 1950s, everything I paid, a five cents or
[2:02:06.120 --> 2:02:11.360]  10 cents for a comic book sort of pop, candy bars, everything started climbing, and it
[2:02:11.360 --> 2:02:12.360]  hasn't stopped.
[2:02:12.360 --> 2:02:17.520]  And what I want to ask your guest is, he really thinks 2016 is when the brakes are going to
[2:02:17.520 --> 2:02:22.120]  burn out on the inflation engine and everything's going to go to hell?
[2:02:22.120 --> 2:02:25.240]  That's my answer is, the job of a profit is to be wrong.
[2:02:25.240 --> 2:02:29.800]  I mean, Alex and I are the same guy, we're just different nationalities.
[2:02:29.800 --> 2:02:33.160]  We're trying to tell people, wake up, don't let it, don't be a victim.
[2:02:33.160 --> 2:02:34.680]  Yeah, we're giving you our best guess.
[2:02:34.680 --> 2:02:36.160]  It doesn't mean we know everything.
[2:02:36.160 --> 2:02:39.800]  Yeah, we're doing our best, you know, like, we're kind of like Howard Stern, we're shock
[2:02:39.800 --> 2:02:44.880]  jocks, try to say, hey, wake up, take a look around, see what's going on, don't just do
[2:02:44.880 --> 2:02:47.280]  as you're told, like they do in school.
[2:02:47.280 --> 2:02:52.120]  So I don't know, I hope it doesn't happen in 2016, but if it does, like a Boy Scout,
[2:02:52.120 --> 2:02:53.120]  are you prepared for it?
[2:02:53.120 --> 2:02:57.320]  I'll just say this last thing here is this, when that market comes down, the rich are
[2:02:57.320 --> 2:02:58.320]  going to get richer.
[2:02:58.320 --> 2:03:00.320]  What are you going to do?
[2:03:00.320 --> 2:03:04.080]  Because they're going to be preposition and there's things little guys can do, then you'll
[2:03:04.080 --> 2:03:09.560]  get bigger and we need the patriots, the liberty lovers, the conservatives, you know, the classical
[2:03:09.560 --> 2:03:11.360]  liberals to know this stuff.
[2:03:11.360 --> 2:03:15.880]  So it's not just a bunch of cronies like Nancy Pelosi making money, Robert Kiyosaki, thank
[2:03:15.880 --> 2:03:16.880]  you so much.
[2:03:16.880 --> 2:03:20.720]  I hope you'll come back in a few months when the new book comes out as well, Eight Lessons
[2:03:20.720 --> 2:03:22.440]  of Military Leadership for Entrepreneurs.
[2:03:22.440 --> 2:03:24.720]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[2:03:24.720 --> 2:03:25.720]  Amazing interview.
[2:03:25.720 --> 2:03:26.720]  I think that was a really good interview.
[2:03:26.720 --> 2:03:31.280]  We're going to come back and get into something you can do about excitotoxins and things in
[2:03:31.280 --> 2:03:36.520]  household products and how to avoid them and more, as self-help straight away.
[2:03:36.520 --> 2:03:40.560]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[2:03:40.560 --> 2:03:45.680]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors
[2:03:45.680 --> 2:03:48.960]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[2:03:48.960 --> 2:03:54.240]  Just one of the key compounds, BiopQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[2:03:54.240 --> 2:03:56.760]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[2:05:36.560 --> 2:05:40.080]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day.
[2:05:40.080 --> 2:05:43.520]  Big heart-shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[2:05:43.520 --> 2:05:48.000]  What if we the Patriots hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty
[2:05:48.000 --> 2:05:49.440]  and individual empowerment?
[2:05:49.440 --> 2:05:50.800]  I'm all about human potential.
[2:05:50.800 --> 2:05:53.120]  I'm all about the individual being empowered.
[2:05:53.120 --> 2:05:54.440]  The establishment is the opposite.
[2:05:54.440 --> 2:05:59.160]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride, GMO, estrogen mimickers, and the rest of the
[2:05:59.160 --> 2:06:00.160]  garbage.
[2:06:00.160 --> 2:06:04.080]  InfoWars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.
[2:06:04.080 --> 2:06:08.800]  How we can come together and win the human race and celebrate the kickoff of Human Empowerment

[2:06:39.160 --> 2:06:41.440]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[2:06:41.440 --> 2:06:42.440]  Why?
[2:06:42.440 --> 2:06:44.440]  No man is obsolete.
[2:06:44.440 --> 2:06:46.400]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth.
[2:06:46.400 --> 2:06:49.440]  You're more than anachronism, like a ghost from another time.
[2:06:49.440 --> 2:06:54.560]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages.
[2:06:54.560 --> 2:07:00.600]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth, a crawling insect, an ugly, misforn little creature who has
[2:07:00.600 --> 2:07:02.680]  no purpose here, no meaning.
[2:07:02.680 --> 2:07:04.320]  I am a human being.
[2:07:04.320 --> 2:07:12.040]  Words, Mr. Wordsworth, that have no substance and no dementia marrow of a hair like a wind.
[2:07:12.040 --> 2:07:13.040]  I don't care.
[2:07:13.040 --> 2:07:14.760]  I tell you, I don't care.
[2:07:14.760 --> 2:07:16.760]  I'm a human being.
[2:07:16.760 --> 2:07:17.760]  I exist.
[2:07:17.760 --> 2:07:22.760]  If I seek one for a love, that thought lives, even after I'm shoveled in my brain.
[2:07:22.760 --> 2:07:30.760]  The illusions, Mr. Wordsworth, the illusions that you have in your veins that make you
[2:07:30.760 --> 2:07:34.760]  think you have a strength, but you have no strength at all.
[2:07:34.760 --> 2:07:35.760]  Honor has power.
[2:07:35.760 --> 2:07:36.760]  Honor has power.
[2:07:36.760 --> 2:07:37.760]  Honor has power.
[2:07:37.760 --> 2:07:44.760]  Honor has no use for your crime.
[2:07:44.760 --> 2:07:45.760]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[2:07:45.760 --> 2:07:46.760]  It's Dr. Edward Group.
[2:07:46.760 --> 2:07:47.760]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:07:47.760 --> 2:07:52.120]  Well, for the next hour, he's here in studio with us at least once a month.
[2:07:52.120 --> 2:07:55.760]  He comes up from his command center in South Texas to Central Texas.
[2:07:55.760 --> 2:08:00.000]  He's Dr. Edward Group, good friend of mine, the developer of many of the products at
[2:08:00.000 --> 2:08:05.080]  InfoWarsLife.com, which we found our operation with good old-fashioned, high-quality products.
[2:08:05.080 --> 2:08:09.480]  Our goal is to bring you very high-quality products at very competitive prices when you

[2:08:14.640 --> 2:08:17.440]  system and are happier and have more energy.
[2:08:17.440 --> 2:08:18.840]  We get to use the products.
[2:08:18.840 --> 2:08:27.320]  We get to fund our operation and have a win, win, win, win, win, because my rule is, well,
[2:08:27.320 --> 2:08:31.320]  from my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, do unto others as you have unto you, lay down
[2:08:31.320 --> 2:08:35.760]  your life for your brother, but what's crazy is doing things the old-fashioned way of a
[2:08:35.760 --> 2:08:40.720]  fair shake and treating people like you want, and, you know, I'm not like inviting friends
[2:08:40.720 --> 2:08:42.400]  or family over and cooking a big dinner for them.
[2:08:42.400 --> 2:08:45.480]  I mean, I just have that hospitality, and our listeners understand that, and they've
[2:08:45.480 --> 2:08:49.760]  given us hospitality, and we want to thank them for all their financial support.
[2:08:49.760 --> 2:08:52.280]  And going into 2015, we've got a lot of big plans.
[2:08:52.280 --> 2:08:53.360]  We've launched so much of it.
[2:08:53.360 --> 2:08:54.360]  You've seen the effect.
[2:08:54.360 --> 2:08:58.520]  You've seen the enemy double and triple and quadruple their attacks.
[2:08:58.520 --> 2:09:03.080]  It's because they're giving us, basically, Oscars, they're giving us awards, they're
[2:09:03.080 --> 2:09:07.160]  giving us Emmys, Grammys, they're giving us the Blue Reven, they're giving us the Science
[2:09:07.160 --> 2:09:08.360]  Fair Award.
[2:09:08.360 --> 2:09:14.480]  They don't tell you you're great or ignore you when you're not hurting.
[2:09:14.480 --> 2:09:22.800]  When they demonize you and attack you, first they ignore you, then they attack you, then
[2:09:22.800 --> 2:09:27.920]  you win, to paraphrase Mahatma Gandhi, and we're entering the hardcore attack.
[2:09:27.920 --> 2:09:31.240]  And listen, who knows what will happen to my operation going through all this?
[2:09:31.240 --> 2:09:32.240]  Who knows what will happen to Alex Jones?
[2:09:32.240 --> 2:09:34.680]  I could die in a car wreck today, God forbid.
[2:09:34.680 --> 2:09:37.960]  All these other great people, some of them who were doing this before I was, like Dr.
[2:09:37.960 --> 2:09:40.360]  Group, they're out there taking action.
[2:09:40.360 --> 2:09:41.920]  They're not backing down.
[2:09:41.920 --> 2:09:43.320]  People understand the game plan.
[2:09:43.320 --> 2:09:48.000]  They understand the globalist operation, whereas 20 years ago, almost no one knew the Federal
[2:09:48.000 --> 2:09:49.000]  Reserve was private.
[2:09:49.000 --> 2:09:50.640]  Almost no one knew what crony capitalism was.
[2:09:50.640 --> 2:09:54.400]  Almost no one knew the IRS was set up, saying, here's the Federal Reserve at Jekyll Island.
[2:09:54.400 --> 2:09:56.760]  Now that stuff's out there, even in the general public.
[2:09:56.760 --> 2:10:02.960]  So you've got the hired mercenaries of the system and their camp followers, who a lot
[2:10:02.960 --> 2:10:06.240]  of them believe, we've got to prop it up, even if it's a fraud, it's going to crush
[2:10:06.240 --> 2:10:07.240]  us when it falls.
[2:10:07.240 --> 2:10:12.480]  It's designed to implode globally into the New World Order government, which is worse.
[2:10:12.480 --> 2:10:14.600]  So I'll be quite frank.
[2:10:14.600 --> 2:10:17.240]  I don't even want this thing to collapse, even though it's corrupted out of control
[2:10:17.240 --> 2:10:18.240]  and has problems.
[2:10:18.240 --> 2:10:19.240]  I don't want civil war.
[2:10:19.240 --> 2:10:20.360]  I don't want cop shot.
[2:10:20.360 --> 2:10:25.600]  I don't want any of that, because that brings in the global government.
[2:10:25.600 --> 2:10:27.680]  So they accuse us of trying to destabilize.
[2:10:27.680 --> 2:10:31.440]  We're trying to stabilize, and everybody knows it, and I'll tell you this.
[2:10:31.440 --> 2:10:36.520]  Good sectors of the establishment that are not insane, who are not self-destructive,
[2:10:36.520 --> 2:10:40.640]  listen to this show, and they already knew what was going on before I was probably born,
[2:10:40.640 --> 2:10:44.320]  but they understand we're entering a very dangerous sector.
[2:10:44.320 --> 2:10:48.720]  So even if they got their wealth or secured their wealth through the system, they understand
[2:10:48.720 --> 2:10:52.080]  that they're going into a new level of the system in the end game, where there's not
[2:10:52.080 --> 2:10:54.920]  going to be very many people at the top.
[2:10:54.920 --> 2:10:59.440]  In fact, there's going to be one at the top, one ring, and in the darkness, bind them.
[2:10:59.440 --> 2:11:00.440]  Take that allegory.
[2:11:00.440 --> 2:11:04.120]  That's the devil at the center of the spotter's web, and you can say, oh, the devil doesn't
[2:11:04.120 --> 2:11:05.120]  exist.
[2:11:05.120 --> 2:11:06.120]  Fine.
[2:11:06.120 --> 2:11:07.120]  For the sake of argument, doesn't exist.
[2:11:07.120 --> 2:11:11.720]  I don't believe that, but I'm saying, for the sake of argument, this archetype, it seeks
[2:11:11.720 --> 2:11:14.160]  total power over everything.
[2:11:14.160 --> 2:11:16.880]  Germany had a great economy doing great.
[2:11:16.880 --> 2:11:19.000]  Why did Hitler start invading everything?
[2:11:19.000 --> 2:11:21.360]  Because that's what he did.
[2:11:21.360 --> 2:11:22.360]  The communist.
[2:11:22.360 --> 2:11:23.480]  Why did they do it?
[2:11:23.480 --> 2:11:25.000]  They want to dominate.
[2:11:25.000 --> 2:11:30.400]  Why does Jeffrey Dahmer grab 12-year-olds off the street and torture them to death?
[2:11:30.400 --> 2:11:31.400]  Because that's what they do.
[2:11:31.400 --> 2:11:35.320]  When you're dealing with a mentally ill person or a psychopath, you're like, this doesn't
[2:11:35.320 --> 2:11:36.320]  make sense.
[2:11:36.320 --> 2:11:37.320]  Well, it doesn't matter.
[2:11:37.320 --> 2:11:38.320]  Stop trying to...
[2:11:38.320 --> 2:11:40.120]  I mean, I say stop trying to figure it out.
[2:11:40.120 --> 2:11:43.960]  You do need to figure it out, but once you know they're nuts, once you know they're following
[2:11:43.960 --> 2:11:49.320]  a different logic path, and to them it all makes sense, it's like a psychological virus.
[2:11:49.320 --> 2:11:53.520]  You just got to step aside from it and go, hey, this is the cause of the problem.
[2:11:53.520 --> 2:11:57.880]  We're not offering some utopia, but we are offering solutions that'll make a better world.
[2:11:57.880 --> 2:11:59.320]  We have goodwill.
[2:11:59.320 --> 2:12:00.720]  We want to be treated good.
[2:12:00.720 --> 2:12:01.880]  We want to be safe.
[2:12:01.880 --> 2:12:04.080]  We want you to be treated good and be victorious.
[2:12:04.080 --> 2:12:05.280]  We like winners.
[2:12:05.280 --> 2:12:09.920]  We don't see somebody do good in business or somebody win the 100-yard dash and get mad.
[2:12:09.920 --> 2:12:11.420]  We admire those people.
[2:12:11.420 --> 2:12:14.880]  We don't see someone come up with a better product and go, I want to destroy them.
[2:12:14.880 --> 2:12:16.960]  We go, let's make something better.
[2:12:16.960 --> 2:12:22.520]  But this loser mentality that is the opposite of what built this country is hate everyone
[2:12:22.520 --> 2:12:26.880]  who's successful or beautiful, period, but then don't care about the Warren Buffett's
[2:12:26.880 --> 2:12:28.680]  that got it through theft, basically.
[2:12:28.680 --> 2:12:33.360]  So you've got this super elite who've taught us how to hate success, taught us not to believe
[2:12:33.360 --> 2:12:38.320]  we can have success when it's waiting there for us the minute we understand history.
[2:12:38.320 --> 2:12:42.280]  Now, I've kind of gone off into a self-help area because I've been saying for a year,
[2:12:42.280 --> 2:12:46.240]  I want to get into that on air and start really trying to help people with what we can do
[2:12:46.240 --> 2:12:47.600]  or more than a year.
[2:12:47.600 --> 2:12:48.600]  Savage is going that direction.
[2:12:48.600 --> 2:12:49.960]  I don't think he's imitating me.
[2:12:49.960 --> 2:12:50.960]  He's super smart.
[2:12:50.960 --> 2:12:54.000]  He gets what people need, what they're ready for.
[2:12:54.000 --> 2:12:55.880]  They're done messing with the system.
[2:12:55.880 --> 2:13:01.520]  We're still fighting on that level, but it's about us changing our decisions in health,
[2:13:01.520 --> 2:13:06.360]  in wellness, in defense, in quite frankly, the system's lawless now.
[2:13:06.360 --> 2:13:09.240]  So more and more folks aren't following the system because it's illegitimate.
[2:13:09.240 --> 2:13:10.840]  Dr. Group, I've been ranting.
[2:13:10.840 --> 2:13:11.840]  You've got the floor.
[2:13:11.840 --> 2:13:16.040]  Talk about the state of the world, the big vaccine push, and your big breakdown if you're
[2:13:16.040 --> 2:13:17.040]  a TV viewer.
[2:13:17.040 --> 2:13:18.200]  You can see all this.
[2:13:18.200 --> 2:13:24.400]  Household items from Tums, to Reynolds Wrap, to Tampons, to Baby Oil, to Lone Star Beer,
[2:13:24.400 --> 2:13:30.720]  to Dixie Cups, to Baking Soda, to just a bottled water.
[2:13:30.720 --> 2:13:34.960]  You've got a whole bunch of stuff there that's household getting into these trace toxins that
[2:13:34.960 --> 2:13:37.840]  they admit are killing us, so we'll break it all down today.
[2:13:37.840 --> 2:13:43.960]  Dr. Edward Group of the Global Healing Center and the guy advising and consulting to M4WarsLife.com.
[2:13:43.960 --> 2:13:50.120]  Well, exactly, it's like a big pharma executive once said, the biggest tragedy is if we kill
[2:13:50.120 --> 2:13:54.560]  people with pharmaceuticals, but the second biggest tragedy is if we cure people with
[2:13:54.560 --> 2:13:55.560]  pharmaceuticals.
[2:13:55.560 --> 2:14:04.280]  So it all boils down to the combination of talking about self-help is how do we recognize
[2:14:04.280 --> 2:14:10.360]  all of the things that are going on around us so we can avoid it and we can educate people.
[2:14:10.360 --> 2:14:13.640]  And one of the things that I wanted to talk about today was, and we've talked about it
[2:14:13.640 --> 2:14:18.720]  before, is the attack on our hormones and the epigenetics because right now there's
[2:14:18.720 --> 2:14:22.560]  such an attack, a broad spectrum attack.
[2:14:22.560 --> 2:14:26.680]  It's not one thing that they focus or they poison you with.
[2:14:26.680 --> 2:14:30.440]  It's a combination of thousands of different things, but it's got to the point now where
[2:14:30.440 --> 2:14:37.600]  they're literally trying to change the genes even when the fetus is in the womb and focusing
[2:14:37.600 --> 2:14:38.600]  on right now-
[2:14:38.600 --> 2:14:43.560]  So they're creating designer babies through a cocktail warfare approach.
[2:14:43.560 --> 2:14:47.520]  Like I've talked about before, you have the endocrine system and there's an attack on
[2:14:47.520 --> 2:14:50.520]  the endocrine system and for those people out there that don't know what the endocrine
[2:14:50.520 --> 2:14:53.720]  system is, it's composed of the glands that secrete hormones.
[2:14:53.720 --> 2:14:55.960]  It's really responsible for running your whole body.
[2:14:55.960 --> 2:14:58.160]  I saw the number in Leave It Time magazine last year.
[2:14:58.160 --> 2:15:02.240]  The average 40-year-old man has half the testosterone they used to have.
[2:15:02.240 --> 2:15:03.240]  Right.
[2:15:03.240 --> 2:15:07.400]  At least be against police being given that, but they need to because they have half the
[2:15:07.400 --> 2:15:08.400]  testosterone.
[2:15:08.400 --> 2:15:11.000]  I know I'm obviously overdue it, but I mean, we're under attack.
[2:15:11.000 --> 2:15:15.600]  It's a slow way to keep you in the system to keep you controlled because number one,
[2:15:15.600 --> 2:15:20.400]  you have the pituitary gland, which is an important hormone-producing gland in the body.
[2:15:20.400 --> 2:15:23.120]  That's knocked out with calcification with the fluoride.
[2:15:23.120 --> 2:15:27.280]  Then you have the thyroid gland, which is also knocked out with the calcification of
[2:15:27.280 --> 2:15:31.240]  fluoride and all the other bromine and chlorine and everything else.
[2:15:31.240 --> 2:15:35.680]  Then you have the intestines, which is one of the largest endocrine glands and the intestines
[2:15:35.680 --> 2:15:42.000]  are taking a severe attack with all the diet drinks, the GMO foods, the microwave foods,
[2:15:42.000 --> 2:15:43.680]  all of that stuff.
[2:15:43.680 --> 2:15:50.280]  Then you have the ovaries, the testes, the reproductive system that's taking a beating
[2:15:50.280 --> 2:15:52.920]  right now with all the different types of chemicals.
[2:15:52.920 --> 2:15:58.880]  So really what you have is a combination of endocrine disrupting chemicals that are causing
[2:15:58.880 --> 2:16:05.440]  hormone deficiencies, testosterone deficiency in males, estrogen dominance in males, estrogen
[2:16:05.440 --> 2:16:10.680]  dominance in females, and then you're getting a whole list of symptoms out there that are
[2:16:10.680 --> 2:16:19.160]  affecting everybody, anywhere from headaches to sterility, creating how this all ties into
[2:16:19.160 --> 2:16:21.720]  the population control agenda as well.
[2:16:21.720 --> 2:16:26.480]  Not only creating sterility, but the list of multiple symptoms that ultimately affect
[2:16:26.480 --> 2:16:30.720]  these organs, and then the individuals go in and get on prescription medications, and
[2:16:30.720 --> 2:16:33.360]  then one prescription medication leads to two.
[2:16:33.360 --> 2:16:37.760]  By the way, the prescription medications a lot of times contain fluoride compounds, chlorine
[2:16:37.760 --> 2:16:42.040]  compounds, and a list of other things that are going to disrupt your hormone level.
[2:16:42.040 --> 2:16:43.040]  So we're being bombed.
[2:16:43.040 --> 2:16:49.240]  Well, one of the things with disrupting the endocrine system is it usually causes some
[2:16:49.240 --> 2:16:50.920]  form of mental illness.
[2:16:50.920 --> 2:16:51.920]  Of course.
[2:16:51.920 --> 2:16:54.720]  So you're going to have depression, you're going to have excess stress, you're going
[2:16:54.720 --> 2:16:57.280]  to have anxiety, you're going to have psychosis.
[2:16:57.280 --> 2:17:01.760]  Well, that's why Supermael makes me so much more nicer, even the crew has said it since
[2:17:01.760 --> 2:17:09.000]  I went to a larger dose, is really, I mean, it's got a bunch of known things that are
[2:17:09.000 --> 2:17:10.520]  in these plants.
[2:17:10.520 --> 2:17:11.520]  What is it doing to my body?
[2:17:11.520 --> 2:17:14.040]  I mean, that didn't mean this to be an infomercial, but I'm just bringing it up.
[2:17:14.040 --> 2:17:15.600]  Why is it so dramatic for men and women?
[2:17:15.600 --> 2:17:19.120]  Well, that's one of the reasons that I started working on is because, number one, you need
[2:17:19.120 --> 2:17:22.800]  to avoid some of those chemicals, and we'll go over some of the most common ones in your
[2:17:22.800 --> 2:17:23.800]  household in a minute.
[2:17:23.800 --> 2:17:24.800]  Here's an example.
[2:17:24.800 --> 2:17:26.200]  I was exhausted yesterday at about five.
[2:17:26.200 --> 2:17:29.320]  I just took a double dose of it, had incredible energy, told 11.
[2:17:29.320 --> 2:17:34.680]  One of this right here actually brought some of these product reviews, and this was from
[2:17:34.680 --> 2:17:40.160]  a happy wife that wrote in, according to my husband, Supermael Vitality is amazing and
[2:17:40.160 --> 2:17:42.880]  easy to take, tastes good, works.
[2:17:42.880 --> 2:17:47.360]  I asked to elaborate on works, but he said, I don't know, works makes you feel better
[2:17:47.360 --> 2:17:48.360]  all around.
[2:17:48.360 --> 2:17:54.400]  And then she says, now let me tell you what I, has his wife have to say, oh my wow, not
[2:17:54.400 --> 2:18:01.520]  only is he in a better mood all the time, not that he hasn't been before, but men man straight
[2:18:01.520 --> 2:18:02.520]  too.
[2:18:02.520 --> 2:18:07.600]  Let me tell you, ladies, get this for your man, put it in his coffee if you have to,
[2:18:07.600 --> 2:18:08.600]  it works.
[2:18:08.600 --> 2:18:14.360]  Plus, as an added bonus, the incredible increase in sex drive, yay, I'm never letting my husband
[2:18:14.360 --> 2:18:16.800]  stop taking Supermael Vitality.
[2:18:16.800 --> 2:18:18.280]  So many good benefits from this.
[2:18:18.280 --> 2:18:19.280]  Just try it, folks.
[2:18:19.280 --> 2:18:21.120]  You're going to instantly be hooked.
[2:18:21.120 --> 2:18:22.920]  So we have to do something about it.
[2:18:22.920 --> 2:18:26.040]  So being our testosterone levels are low, our estrogen levels are high.

[2:19:37.280 --> 2:19:38.280]  Gold isn't for you.
[2:19:38.280 --> 2:19:42.240]  Ted Anderson, president of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious
[2:19:42.240 --> 2:19:43.560]  metal investing firms.
[2:19:43.560 --> 2:19:44.560]  I get it.
[2:19:44.560 --> 2:19:48.240]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job that the
[2:19:48.240 --> 2:19:52.800]  Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy that social security would
[2:19:52.800 --> 2:19:53.800]  be there for you.
[2:19:53.800 --> 2:19:55.200]  That's not what's happening.
[2:19:55.200 --> 2:20:00.040]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation or that the
[2:20:00.040 --> 2:20:03.640]  dollar wouldn't lose value or that your retirement would be secure.
[2:20:03.640 --> 2:20:07.080]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[2:20:07.080 --> 2:20:11.360]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[2:20:11.360 --> 2:20:17.280]  Since 2001, the US dollar index has tanked 30 percent while gold has risen 300 percent.
[2:20:17.280 --> 2:20:20.600]  But now savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[2:20:20.600 --> 2:20:21.600]  You should, too.

[2:22:05.240 --> 2:22:06.320]  This is an alert.
[2:22:06.320 --> 2:22:10.640]  If your business or church is building this year, you're about to pay more than you should.
[2:22:10.640 --> 2:22:14.680]  This could mean thousands of dollars more for your office, retail space, church or warehouse.

[2:22:29.040 --> 2:22:44.360]  That's 866-91-Steel, that's 866-917-8335.
[2:22:44.360 --> 2:22:48.320]  By the way, Alex Jones here back live, when I had Dr. Grip drive up here to be on the
[2:22:48.320 --> 2:22:52.480]  show, we were just going to cover endocrine disruptors and not get into an infomercial
[2:22:52.480 --> 2:22:53.480]  on infowarslife.com.
[2:22:53.480 --> 2:23:00.440]  But we've got a copyright claim for showing a BBC news article concerning New Haven.
[2:23:00.440 --> 2:23:05.680]  I mean, I'd check with a lawyer too, it's just absolutely out of violation, totally
[2:23:05.680 --> 2:23:06.680]  absolutely fraudulent.
[2:23:06.680 --> 2:23:10.720]  And we've contacted the people involved and said, you better remove this, we're going
[2:23:10.720 --> 2:23:12.240]  to take action.
[2:23:12.240 --> 2:23:16.360]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement has been taken down.
[2:23:16.360 --> 2:23:17.840]  One version had 4 million views.
[2:23:17.840 --> 2:23:24.800]  A company out of Canada is claiming they own the music, Rob Jacobson made some of the music
[2:23:24.800 --> 2:23:30.280]  and also hired Golden Arm Trio that makes music for Richard Linkletter movies and paid
[2:23:30.280 --> 2:23:36.600]  them handsomely to make original scores with a partial symphony.
[2:23:36.600 --> 2:23:41.280]  I was there where they wrote the music and played it and this group says they own my
[2:23:41.280 --> 2:23:45.040]  film and they won't take the strike off.
[2:23:45.040 --> 2:23:49.480]  So we're getting hit on other channels, our channels, harassment's coming out of the woodwork
[2:23:49.480 --> 2:23:55.160]  and now Gizmodo that's a huge site has come out and they're going to have to do a retraction
[2:23:55.160 --> 2:23:58.040]  because at a certain point I've got to take action.
[2:23:58.040 --> 2:24:02.160]  They say that we're selling table salt as our nascent iodine as if table salt even has
[2:24:02.160 --> 2:24:03.800]  iodine in it.
[2:24:03.800 --> 2:24:11.200]  They say that it is potassium iodine and not nascent iodine when that's not what it
[2:24:11.200 --> 2:24:17.240]  is and then they attack our vitamin B12 and they just basically say we're quacks.
[2:24:17.240 --> 2:24:20.240]  I mean they, the word has gone out.
[2:24:20.240 --> 2:24:24.240]  We're being attacked at probably, let's not exaggerate, five times any previous level.
[2:24:24.240 --> 2:24:26.880]  Dr. Group, you read this article, they brought it into me during the break.
[2:24:26.880 --> 2:24:28.760]  I didn't know that this had happened.
[2:24:28.760 --> 2:24:30.560]  You've already seen this.
[2:24:30.560 --> 2:24:37.200]  The online store were preppers by their BS cures and then it's attacking me when in
[2:24:37.200 --> 2:24:41.000]  the industry we talk to the companies that make it not just your factory but some of
[2:24:41.000 --> 2:24:44.280]  the other products and they say we're so proud to work with you.
[2:24:44.280 --> 2:24:47.920]  This is the most expensive formulation ever, what you actually put into it versus what
[2:24:47.920 --> 2:24:49.080]  you sell it for.
[2:24:49.080 --> 2:24:51.760]  So they're now trying to defame us right now.
[2:24:51.760 --> 2:24:54.760]  Obviously, the order's gone out because we're exposing the vaccines.
[2:24:54.760 --> 2:24:56.640]  Dr. Group, what do you make of this?
[2:24:56.640 --> 2:24:57.640]  I agree.
[2:24:57.640 --> 2:25:03.280]  There's an attack right now on natural health from companies all over the world.
[2:25:03.280 --> 2:25:08.440]  I definitely think something should be done about it but the good thing is they're not
[2:25:08.440 --> 2:25:09.440]  going to find anything.
[2:25:09.440 --> 2:25:13.440]  They obviously don't know what they're talking about because they're saying table salt.
[2:25:13.440 --> 2:25:15.160]  So I think it's just that.
[2:25:15.160 --> 2:25:17.560]  Actually, Finn Feinberg wrote this.
[2:25:17.560 --> 2:25:22.320]  There is absolutely the products that you have in the InfoWars life that the ones that
[2:25:22.320 --> 2:25:25.520]  were manufacturing and even the ones that you have that I still love.
[2:25:25.520 --> 2:25:26.840]  Do we have you review it?
[2:25:26.840 --> 2:25:27.840]  You have me review.
[2:25:27.840 --> 2:25:28.840]  I mean...
[2:25:28.840 --> 2:25:29.840]  And outside lawyers.
[2:25:29.840 --> 2:25:30.840]  Guaranteed.
[2:25:30.840 --> 2:25:35.400]  I mean, you will not find a pure, better product anywhere in the world.
[2:25:35.400 --> 2:25:38.760]  By the way, we expected all these attacks years ago when I launched Supplement Line.
[2:25:38.760 --> 2:25:40.760]  So, good luck.
[2:25:40.760 --> 2:25:46.720]  If they hired some sort of a chemist or biochemist or nutraceutical analyst, there's nothing
[2:25:46.720 --> 2:25:47.720]  they could...
[2:25:47.720 --> 2:25:48.720]  They don't even say that.
[2:25:48.720 --> 2:25:51.080]  They just say most likely it's table salt in it.
[2:25:51.080 --> 2:25:55.200]  Just most likely, you know, that there's flying monkeys in the bottle.
[2:25:55.200 --> 2:25:56.200]  It says...
[2:25:56.200 --> 2:25:57.200]  Here, let me read this part.
[2:25:57.200 --> 2:26:01.240]  If you're buying a supplement promoted as an iodine, it is most likely sodium iodine.
[2:26:01.240 --> 2:26:02.240]  See, they say supplement.
[2:26:02.240 --> 2:26:03.240]  They say it's us.
[2:26:03.240 --> 2:26:04.240]  Don't even say though.
[2:26:04.240 --> 2:26:05.600]  This is all written by a lawyer, it looks like.
[2:26:05.600 --> 2:26:06.600]  To be safe.
[2:26:06.600 --> 2:26:07.600]  See?
[2:26:07.600 --> 2:26:08.600]  We're a fraud.
[2:26:08.600 --> 2:26:09.600]  We're a scam.
[2:26:09.600 --> 2:26:10.600]  We're BS, but...
[2:26:10.600 --> 2:26:11.600]  Oh, and it's some other product.
[2:26:11.600 --> 2:26:12.600]  Not them.
[2:26:12.600 --> 2:26:13.600]  Some other product might be salt.
[2:26:13.600 --> 2:26:14.600]  Not us.
[2:26:14.600 --> 2:26:15.600]  We're not salt.
[2:26:15.600 --> 2:26:16.600]  Are we?
[2:26:16.600 --> 2:26:19.960]  Are we potassium iodine?
[2:26:19.960 --> 2:26:22.660]  We are not potassium iodine.
[2:26:22.660 --> 2:26:25.880]  We are pure crystalline iodine.
[2:26:25.880 --> 2:26:26.880]  Are we sodium iodine?
[2:26:26.880 --> 2:26:29.520]  Deep in the earth, we are not sodium iodine.
[2:26:29.520 --> 2:26:31.020]  And that...
[2:26:31.020 --> 2:26:33.800]  They were probably paid, is what I'm guessing, by a pharmaceutical...
[2:26:33.800 --> 2:26:35.720]  I mean, I was reading this during a three minute break.
[2:26:35.720 --> 2:26:37.920]  It's all just a load of bull.
[2:26:37.920 --> 2:26:38.920]  It is.
[2:26:38.920 --> 2:26:39.920]  It is.
[2:26:39.920 --> 2:26:40.920]  Absolutely.
[2:26:40.920 --> 2:26:41.920]  Can I just jump in for a minute as well?
[2:26:41.920 --> 2:26:42.920]  This is Anthony Guccardi.
[2:26:42.920 --> 2:26:45.600]  I'll hold you over, but I got to say this, Anthony.
[2:26:45.600 --> 2:26:47.960]  We searched all over with the methylcobalamin.
[2:26:47.960 --> 2:26:53.280]  Basically, this is sublingual, the same thing you inject from a pharmacy, or one little
[2:26:53.280 --> 2:26:56.240]  bottle of it costs 30 to 40 dollars.
[2:26:56.240 --> 2:26:57.960]  I know because I inject it, folks, okay?
[2:26:57.960 --> 2:27:00.320]  I inject it on top of it, and I said, this is so good.
[2:27:00.320 --> 2:27:01.640]  We looked into it.
[2:27:01.640 --> 2:27:05.280]  Years in the making, this is methylcobalamin.
[2:27:05.280 --> 2:27:09.520]  If we were to put this in bottles and get a pharmaceutical license to put it out, there's
[2:27:09.520 --> 2:27:15.160]  probably 10 bottles of what I pay 50, 40 bucks for, depending on the pharmacy, in this of
[2:27:15.160 --> 2:27:16.160]  the methylcobalamin.
[2:27:16.160 --> 2:27:17.760]  It is the pharmaceutical grade.
[2:27:17.760 --> 2:27:18.760]  You lying bastards.
[2:27:18.760 --> 2:27:19.760]  I'm sick of the crap.
[2:27:19.760 --> 2:27:23.560]  Not only is it methylcobalamin, it's a denicylcobalamin in there, too.
[2:27:23.560 --> 2:27:25.280]  This is better than the pharmaceutical.
[2:27:25.280 --> 2:27:26.280]  I know.
[2:27:26.280 --> 2:27:27.640]  And then they say, we're selling crap.
[2:27:27.640 --> 2:27:29.880]  Man, I'm sick of everybody defaming me, man.
[2:27:29.880 --> 2:27:32.400]  There's two cofactors of B12.
[2:27:32.400 --> 2:27:33.720]  Even the pharmaceutical company...
[2:27:33.720 --> 2:27:35.320]  You know that you were developing...
[2:27:35.320 --> 2:27:37.560]  This is the Rolls Royce of vitamin B.
[2:27:37.560 --> 2:27:38.560]  That is the Rolls Royce.
[2:27:38.560 --> 2:27:39.560]  I challenge anybody in the world...
[2:27:39.560 --> 2:27:42.480]  And they're telling us that we're selling crap with no evidence.
[2:27:42.480 --> 2:27:43.720]  That is above Rolls Royce.
[2:27:43.720 --> 2:27:44.720]  That's the Bentley.
[2:27:44.720 --> 2:27:46.720]  Maybe I've sent the wrong signal to MSNBC, not soon.
[2:27:46.720 --> 2:27:49.800]  I'm saying I was involved in the Boston bombing, and then they think they can just make anything
[2:27:49.800 --> 2:27:50.800]  up now.
[2:27:50.800 --> 2:27:51.800]  These companies.
[2:27:51.800 --> 2:27:54.800]  Maybe I'm just going to have to go to town, man.
[2:27:54.800 --> 2:27:56.280]  I'm tired of it.
[2:27:56.280 --> 2:27:58.400]  I'm sick of these people.
[2:27:58.400 --> 2:28:03.160]  Well, when something's working and people are actually getting better, and it's very
[2:28:03.160 --> 2:28:06.520]  hard to get positive reviews online when you have a nutraceutical...
[2:28:06.520 --> 2:28:07.520]  Look at us.
[2:28:07.520 --> 2:28:08.520]  We have the highest reviews.
[2:28:08.520 --> 2:28:09.520]  It's sick.
[2:28:09.520 --> 2:28:10.920]  You have 4.8 star reviews.
[2:28:10.920 --> 2:28:11.920]  That's unheard of.
[2:28:11.920 --> 2:28:16.400]  I mean, these products work, and if someone's not happy with them, they have a full money
[2:28:16.400 --> 2:28:17.400]  bank guarantee.
[2:28:17.400 --> 2:28:19.520]  I mean, there's no if, ands, and buts about it.
[2:28:19.520 --> 2:28:21.320]  These are better than pharmaceuticals.
[2:28:21.320 --> 2:28:22.320]  They're nutraceuticals.
[2:28:22.320 --> 2:28:24.200]  Well, let me ride back, Dr. Gribbs.

[2:28:27.200 --> 2:28:28.200]  We're on the march.
[2:28:28.200 --> 2:28:29.200]  We're on the march.
[2:28:29.200 --> 2:28:30.200]  They're scared of these products.

[2:28:31.200 --> 2:28:32.200]  Alex Jones.
[2:28:32.200 --> 2:28:33.200]  I know where we're going.
[2:28:33.200 --> 2:28:34.200]  They can see.
[2:28:34.200 --> 2:28:35.200]  We're on an elevator straight up.
[2:28:35.200 --> 2:28:37.600]  You guys can't stop Freedom.
[2:28:37.600 --> 2:28:42.240]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and

[2:29:43.840 --> 2:29:46.320]  What if we the Patriots hijacked Valentine's Day
[2:29:46.320 --> 2:29:48.480]  and instead made it about human liberty
[2:29:48.480 --> 2:29:49.920]  and individual empowerment?
[2:29:49.920 --> 2:29:51.280]  I'm all about human potential.
[2:29:51.280 --> 2:29:53.520]  I'm all about the individual being empowered.
[2:29:53.520 --> 2:29:55.120]  The establishment is the opposite.
[2:29:55.120 --> 2:29:57.880]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride, GMO,
[2:29:57.880 --> 2:29:59.840]  estrogen mimickers and the rest of the garbage.
[2:29:59.840 --> 2:30:02.720]  Infowars is striking back in the month of February

[2:30:36.840 --> 2:30:38.920]  What disaster is so powerful?
[2:30:38.920 --> 2:30:41.280]  It unleashes a chain of mass pandemics,
[2:30:41.280 --> 2:30:44.160]  economic meltdowns and violent food riots
[2:30:44.160 --> 2:30:45.680]  all at the same time.
[2:30:45.680 --> 2:30:48.120]  NASA has already set the countdown timer
[2:30:48.120 --> 2:30:50.680]  and right now the 21st century apocalypse
[2:30:50.680 --> 2:30:52.800]  is less than 13 months away.
[2:30:52.800 --> 2:30:55.360]  Former CIA director James Woolsey says
[2:30:55.360 --> 2:30:57.920]  two thirds of US population could perish.
[2:30:57.920 --> 2:30:59.960]  In a matter of seconds, the world as we know it
[2:30:59.960 --> 2:31:01.400]  will cease to exist.
[2:31:01.400 --> 2:31:03.600]  The world's economy will be wiped out.
[2:31:03.600 --> 2:31:05.240]  Mass riots will follow.
[2:31:05.240 --> 2:31:07.400]  Ancient diseases will reemerge.
[2:31:07.400 --> 2:31:09.560]  How will you shield yourself and your loved ones
[2:31:09.560 --> 2:31:11.520]  from this upcoming apocalypse?

[2:31:15.240 --> 2:31:17.520]  of protecting yourself, your loved ones
[2:31:17.520 --> 2:31:19.360]  and even your entire community
[2:31:19.360 --> 2:31:21.960]  when this worst case scenario unravels.
[2:31:21.960 --> 2:31:26.840]  That's D-A-R-K-E-S-T-D-A-Y-S dot I-N-F-O.
[2:31:26.840 --> 2:31:28.880]  Darkestays.info.
[2:31:28.880 --> 2:31:31.280]  Go there before this life-saving information
[2:31:31.280 --> 2:31:33.760]  becomes unavailable to the large public.
[2:31:33.760 --> 2:31:36.480]  Go to darkestays.info now.
[2:31:42.280 --> 2:31:44.400]  The Alex Jones Show.
[2:31:44.400 --> 2:31:47.440]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[2:31:50.080 --> 2:31:51.280]  I didn't mean to go off the deep end.
[2:31:51.280 --> 2:31:53.280]  I just, they shoved me this turn to the bright.
[2:31:53.280 --> 2:31:56.280]  They imply there's rat cc's in our products,
[2:31:56.280 --> 2:31:58.560]  in this article.
[2:31:58.560 --> 2:32:00.440]  This is unbelievable.
[2:32:00.440 --> 2:32:01.800]  From Gizmodo, and we looked it up,
[2:32:01.800 --> 2:32:03.160]  I remember they're connected to Gawker,
[2:32:03.160 --> 2:32:05.360]  that is a known democratic party,
[2:32:05.360 --> 2:32:10.360]  hardcore gay lesbian transgender front group.
[2:32:10.480 --> 2:32:12.600]  And I'm not even attacking those groups,
[2:32:12.600 --> 2:32:14.880]  but that's basically what this is.
[2:32:16.480 --> 2:32:17.320]  And I remember over the years,
[2:32:17.320 --> 2:32:19.040]  we'll even just link to a Gizmodo article
[2:32:19.040 --> 2:32:21.040]  about some tech thing and they'll threaten us and stuff.
[2:32:21.040 --> 2:32:23.440]  So they don't like us.
[2:32:23.440 --> 2:32:25.440]  And you know, we built these products,
[2:32:25.440 --> 2:32:26.600]  A, to be really high quality,
[2:32:26.600 --> 2:32:28.200]  so folks wanna come back and keep getting them,
[2:32:28.200 --> 2:32:29.520]  because that's what a real businessman does,
[2:32:29.520 --> 2:32:32.280]  is sell quality at a good price.
[2:32:32.280 --> 2:32:35.160]  Plus, I believe in repurchase so,
[2:32:35.160 --> 2:32:36.800]  but we also set it up knowing,
[2:32:36.800 --> 2:32:39.560]  hey, we might be a target being Alex Jones,
[2:32:39.560 --> 2:32:41.600]  if we're selling nutraceuticals
[2:32:41.600 --> 2:32:42.760]  when they go after everybody.
[2:32:42.760 --> 2:32:45.880]  So we're all set up with lawyers and the file cabinets
[2:32:45.880 --> 2:32:47.800]  and all the filing and all the samples
[2:32:47.800 --> 2:32:49.720]  and all the double triple tested
[2:32:49.720 --> 2:32:52.360]  and outside labs testing and things.
[2:32:52.360 --> 2:32:53.920]  So it's all just made up.
[2:32:53.920 --> 2:32:58.920]  And it shows how they don't want anybody
[2:32:59.000 --> 2:33:00.720]  to be able to fund their own operation.
[2:33:00.720 --> 2:33:02.560]  They don't want people.
[2:33:02.560 --> 2:33:03.400]  I mean, here's an example.
[2:33:03.400 --> 2:33:07.160]  Last winter, my uncle, my cousin died and my great uncle,
[2:33:07.160 --> 2:33:08.000]  all living near each other,
[2:33:08.000 --> 2:33:09.480]  the same weird mystery illness
[2:33:10.640 --> 2:33:13.440]  that are drug resistant bacteria, the best we can tell.
[2:33:13.440 --> 2:33:14.840]  And it was all over the news in Texas,
[2:33:14.840 --> 2:33:16.480]  the mystery hospitals were filled everywhere.
[2:33:16.480 --> 2:33:18.480]  A year down by Houston was incredible.
[2:33:18.480 --> 2:33:19.720]  So I went to a medical doctor,
[2:33:19.720 --> 2:33:22.320]  but one that does nutraceutical stuff as well.
[2:33:22.320 --> 2:33:24.160]  And he said, look, just, you know,
[2:33:24.160 --> 2:33:26.120]  you want to get bolstered and all this stuff.
[2:33:26.120 --> 2:33:27.360]  Yeah, colloidal silver's good.
[2:33:27.360 --> 2:33:28.320]  The antibiotics didn't work.
[2:33:28.320 --> 2:33:29.160]  Another doctor.
[2:33:30.480 --> 2:33:33.280]  And they said, but take vitamin B12 and some other stuff.
[2:33:33.280 --> 2:33:34.560]  So they shot me up a vitamin B12,
[2:33:34.560 --> 2:33:36.240]  it's a little bit of a needle, you don't even feel it.
[2:33:36.240 --> 2:33:38.360]  So I started taking that during the winter season.
[2:33:38.360 --> 2:33:40.520]  I mean, it's killing my family.
[2:33:40.520 --> 2:33:41.600]  That's why I lost weight,
[2:33:41.600 --> 2:33:44.000]  charting to exercise, doing what you say.
[2:33:44.000 --> 2:33:46.000]  I was already getting into it because this is serious.
[2:33:46.000 --> 2:33:47.880]  I want my kids to be healthy.
[2:33:47.880 --> 2:33:49.880]  You know, I give them the methylcobalamin
[2:33:49.880 --> 2:33:50.720]  and the rest of it.
[2:33:50.720 --> 2:33:52.040]  Now I don't inject our brand.
[2:33:52.040 --> 2:33:54.480]  The point is, is that it's the same thing
[2:33:54.480 --> 2:33:56.120]  that is the nutraceutical.
[2:33:56.120 --> 2:33:57.400]  The nutraceutical is the same thing
[2:33:57.400 --> 2:33:59.640]  that basically big pharma is putting out.
[2:33:59.640 --> 2:34:01.080]  In fact, it's hard to find a doctor.
[2:34:01.080 --> 2:34:03.200]  It'll give you the real organic
[2:34:03.200 --> 2:34:05.240]  that isn't the artificial chemical version.
[2:34:05.240 --> 2:34:07.760]  The artificial chemical version is light pink and watery.
[2:34:07.760 --> 2:34:11.720]  The real stuff is just vibrant, super purple red.
[2:34:11.720 --> 2:34:14.200]  Describe what's in secret 12.
[2:34:14.200 --> 2:34:16.840]  What's in secret 12 is a combination.
[2:34:16.840 --> 2:34:19.760]  B12, like what you said, most of it,
[2:34:19.760 --> 2:34:23.640]  even in nutraceutical formulas, is in the cyanocobalamin form.
[2:34:23.640 --> 2:34:25.760]  And that form is very hard to break down.
[2:34:25.760 --> 2:34:27.960]  So really, the majority of people
[2:34:27.960 --> 2:34:31.320]  that think they're taking B12 are B12 deficient.
[2:34:31.320 --> 2:34:34.680]  And with our studies and looking at the population,
[2:34:34.680 --> 2:34:36.720]  we're finding that the majority of people
[2:34:36.720 --> 2:34:38.000]  are B12 deficient.
[2:34:38.000 --> 2:34:40.320]  That's one of the things that we look for
[2:34:40.320 --> 2:34:43.760]  for the Infowars Life Brands is what are people,
[2:34:43.760 --> 2:34:46.240]  the majority of the population deficient in?
[2:34:46.240 --> 2:34:47.880]  Number one, they're deficient in iodine.
[2:34:47.880 --> 2:34:49.480]  Number two, they're deficient in B12.
[2:34:49.480 --> 2:34:50.720]  What are they not doing?
[2:34:50.720 --> 2:34:52.840]  By the way, I forgot, I'm a vitamin B12 shot
[2:34:52.840 --> 2:34:54.280]  in my black jacket in my bathroom,
[2:34:54.280 --> 2:34:55.520]  and I forgot to take this morning.
[2:34:55.520 --> 2:34:56.880]  I got busy and stuck up in my jacket.
[2:34:56.880 --> 2:34:58.120]  I think I'm gonna take that on air.
[2:34:58.120 --> 2:34:58.960]  This is not a stunt.
[2:34:58.960 --> 2:35:00.640]  Just go see what's in my jacket in my bathroom.
[2:35:00.640 --> 2:35:01.440]  Thanks, go ahead, sorry.
[2:35:01.440 --> 2:35:05.680]  Okay, so if you look at what B12 breaks down to
[2:35:05.680 --> 2:35:07.960]  in the body, it breaks down into two cofactors,
[2:35:07.960 --> 2:35:10.760]  methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin.
[2:35:10.760 --> 2:35:13.040]  So what we did was figure out a way
[2:35:13.040 --> 2:35:16.200]  that we could, using our high-tech processing equipment
[2:35:16.200 --> 2:35:20.400]  in our facility, actually take both of those compounds
[2:35:20.400 --> 2:35:22.920]  using the glycerin and this Bajirex processing
[2:35:22.920 --> 2:35:27.440]  and make it almost like a nanoparticle absorbable B
[2:35:27.440 --> 2:35:29.920]  stable supplement that you could take
[2:35:29.920 --> 2:35:31.960]  so you wouldn't have to go get the injection.
[2:35:31.960 --> 2:35:33.600]  So higher absorption rates.
[2:35:33.600 --> 2:35:34.720]  Higher absorption rates.
[2:35:34.720 --> 2:35:38.120]  We've had nothing but thousands and thousands of people
[2:35:38.120 --> 2:35:38.960]  that have been taking that.
[2:35:38.960 --> 2:35:41.200]  By the way, on third-party major rating sites,
[2:35:41.200 --> 2:35:42.240]  we have to do a whole video on this.
[2:35:42.240 --> 2:35:43.080]  We haven't done this yet.
[2:35:43.080 --> 2:35:44.160]  We don't even market properly.
[2:35:44.160 --> 2:35:45.480]  We have the highest ratings.
[2:35:45.480 --> 2:35:46.320]  I don't know.
[2:35:46.320 --> 2:35:47.600]  In fact, you've never seen anything like this.
[2:35:47.600 --> 2:35:49.560]  No, we have third-party ratings too.
[2:35:49.560 --> 2:35:51.200]  We did none of the product reviews.
[2:35:51.200 --> 2:35:52.600]  I mean, you can look on Amazon,
[2:35:52.600 --> 2:35:55.160]  but then on our site and on your site,
[2:35:55.160 --> 2:35:56.800]  you have third-party reviewers.
[2:35:56.800 --> 2:36:00.160]  And that is to ensure that you're not just putting people
[2:36:00.160 --> 2:36:01.320]  fake stories up there saying,
[2:36:01.320 --> 2:36:03.280]  hey, I took this product and it did good.
[2:36:03.280 --> 2:36:05.400]  I mean, those have to be approved by a third party
[2:36:05.400 --> 2:36:07.080]  before they go on the site.
[2:36:07.080 --> 2:36:08.880]  This was in my jacket because this morning,
[2:36:08.880 --> 2:36:11.080]  I only take it about once a week.
[2:36:11.080 --> 2:36:14.560]  This is vitamin B12 that I forgot to take this morning.
[2:36:14.560 --> 2:36:15.800]  Then is that the methylcobalamin?
[2:36:15.800 --> 2:36:16.960]  Yeah, this is from the doctor.
[2:36:16.960 --> 2:36:18.760]  It's the only little prescriptions I got.
[2:36:18.760 --> 2:36:19.600]  Okay.
[2:36:19.600 --> 2:36:20.960]  And I'm gonna take it right now.
[2:36:22.040 --> 2:36:23.360]  Take it to the stomach.
[2:36:23.360 --> 2:36:24.400]  I mean, this isn't a game.
[2:36:24.400 --> 2:36:25.680]  I'm not gonna let these people kill me.
[2:36:25.680 --> 2:36:30.000]  I mean, the point is I believe in these products.
[2:36:30.000 --> 2:36:32.560]  Well, the thing is with the secret 12,
[2:36:32.560 --> 2:36:35.440]  you can get just as much B12 as you can
[2:36:35.440 --> 2:36:37.280]  by taking an injection and you can get
[2:36:37.280 --> 2:36:39.600]  the adenosylcobalamin as well.
[2:36:39.600 --> 2:36:41.800]  So even if you did want to take an injection,
[2:36:41.800 --> 2:36:44.320]  you can still take a squad of needles.
[2:36:44.320 --> 2:36:45.280]  These are so little.
[2:36:45.280 --> 2:36:47.720]  Yeah, and you don't inject us in your fat,
[2:36:47.720 --> 2:36:48.680]  stuff that we have.
[2:36:48.680 --> 2:36:51.800]  And the thing is, I mean, I bring this up all the time
[2:36:51.800 --> 2:36:52.680]  is the children.
[2:36:52.680 --> 2:36:54.520]  I mean, we gotta look at the next generation
[2:36:54.520 --> 2:36:56.600]  and with these endocrine disrupting chemicals
[2:36:56.600 --> 2:36:59.040]  and how they're disrupting the testosterone
[2:36:59.040 --> 2:37:00.880]  and the estrogen of the children.
[2:37:00.880 --> 2:37:01.720]  And even- Exactly.
[2:37:01.720 --> 2:37:05.080]  I'm fighting back with the nation iodine,
[2:37:05.080 --> 2:37:07.880]  the true nation iodine, with the cleansing,
[2:37:07.880 --> 2:37:11.400]  with the purified water, with the vitamin B12.
[2:37:11.400 --> 2:37:12.920]  I'm fighting back.
[2:37:12.920 --> 2:37:15.080]  My dad had two different things of antibiotics.
[2:37:15.080 --> 2:37:16.280]  He couldn't get well.
[2:37:16.280 --> 2:37:17.360]  We almost thought they were targeting
[2:37:17.360 --> 2:37:18.520]  our family or something.
[2:37:18.520 --> 2:37:20.600]  And then he drank like three bottles of little silver
[2:37:20.600 --> 2:37:22.520]  over a couple of weeks and it knocked it out.
[2:37:22.520 --> 2:37:24.000]  So we're not saying there aren't side effects
[2:37:24.000 --> 2:37:26.480]  of little silver, but man, you know what?
[2:37:26.480 --> 2:37:27.560]  My dad's alive.
[2:37:27.560 --> 2:37:29.040]  The reason why they're attacking you
[2:37:29.040 --> 2:37:32.600]  is because nobody has figured out the core nutrients
[2:37:32.600 --> 2:37:35.760]  that you need these days to stay alive
[2:37:35.760 --> 2:37:38.800]  and combat the attack that they're putting on us.
[2:37:38.800 --> 2:37:40.800]  Okay, they're attacking and taking B vitamins
[2:37:40.800 --> 2:37:42.880]  out of everything to cause B12 deficiency.
[2:37:42.880 --> 2:37:44.080]  As well as-
[2:37:44.080 --> 2:37:45.560]  I think the same group of memory serves
[2:37:45.560 --> 2:37:46.920]  or was Gawker, it was Gawker actually,
[2:37:46.920 --> 2:37:49.400]  it's the same company, memory serves.
[2:37:49.400 --> 2:37:51.920]  Check and make sure folks, my memory says they're Gawker.
[2:37:51.920 --> 2:37:54.440]  They attacked us for saying juice liners will make you gay.
[2:37:54.440 --> 2:37:56.640]  Well, no, what I said was it was making the frogs
[2:37:56.640 --> 2:38:00.320]  have both biological organs, hemaphrodites,
[2:38:00.320 --> 2:38:01.240]  and it was doing it to humans.
[2:38:01.240 --> 2:38:03.960]  And I was showing studies about this phenol A.
[2:38:03.960 --> 2:38:06.400]  Their answer was to say I was bashing gay people.
[2:38:06.400 --> 2:38:08.080]  I mean, that's just who these people are folks.
[2:38:08.080 --> 2:38:09.280]  They don't want you to know.
[2:38:09.280 --> 2:38:12.720]  So getting off the infowordslife.com products,
[2:38:12.720 --> 2:38:14.880]  get into the stuff people can actually do for themselves.
[2:38:14.880 --> 2:38:17.720]  So what's happening is they're trying to create sterility
[2:38:17.720 --> 2:38:19.240]  and they're trying to create-
[2:38:19.240 --> 2:38:20.240]  By the way, it was Gawker.
[2:38:20.240 --> 2:38:22.960]  Crazy radio hosting juice boxes for making kids gay.
[2:38:22.960 --> 2:38:24.200]  See how sick they are?
[2:38:24.200 --> 2:38:27.400]  But sorry, everybody knows these plastics hurting people.
[2:38:27.400 --> 2:38:28.720]  So you're the ones that are discredited.
[2:38:28.720 --> 2:38:29.560]  I'm sorry.
[2:38:29.560 --> 2:38:30.440]  I'm gonna get Anthony in here too.
[2:38:30.440 --> 2:38:31.640]  I know I'm ranting, go ahead.
[2:38:31.640 --> 2:38:35.080]  Okay, so I mean, there's thousands upon thousands
[2:38:35.080 --> 2:38:38.040]  of household items that you can have in your house.
[2:38:38.040 --> 2:38:40.000]  And I just bought a few of them here to show people
[2:38:40.000 --> 2:38:41.680]  because how many men do you know
[2:38:41.680 --> 2:38:43.760]  that drink beer on a regular basis?
[2:38:43.760 --> 2:38:47.600]  Beer, it actually increases the estrogen content in males.
[2:38:47.600 --> 2:38:48.440]  It also-
[2:38:48.440 --> 2:38:49.280]  Is that the hops?
[2:38:49.280 --> 2:38:50.120]  Aluminum.
[2:38:50.120 --> 2:38:51.840]  Well, the hops has the dioxins
[2:38:51.840 --> 2:38:54.760]  because hops is heavily sprayed with pesticides
[2:38:54.760 --> 2:38:59.520]  and herbicides, mostly from Monsanto and Singenta.
[2:38:59.520 --> 2:39:02.920]  So not only do you get the pesticide residue from the hops,
[2:39:02.920 --> 2:39:04.480]  but you get the aluminum,
[2:39:04.480 --> 2:39:09.120]  which is a metalloestrogen mimicker,
[2:39:09.120 --> 2:39:12.400]  as well as some of the other heavy metals,
[2:39:12.400 --> 2:39:14.440]  but you also have alcohol in itself.
[2:39:14.440 --> 2:39:16.480]  So drink organic beer and drink it out of bottles.
[2:39:16.480 --> 2:39:19.560]  And you have the bisphenol-lined cans as well.
[2:39:19.560 --> 2:39:20.400]  Which is even worse.
[2:39:20.400 --> 2:39:22.560]  So I mean, everybody thinks bisphenol-A is gone,
[2:39:22.560 --> 2:39:23.400]  but it's not.
[2:39:23.400 --> 2:39:26.960]  I mean, it was a hoax with them taking it out of baby bottles.
[2:39:26.960 --> 2:39:29.160]  But it was a victory to show they at least had the hoax.
[2:39:29.160 --> 2:39:30.400]  But for those that don't know,
[2:39:30.400 --> 2:39:32.760]  most of the microwave liners you get for food,
[2:39:32.760 --> 2:39:35.200]  even if it says organic on the box when it heats up,
[2:39:35.200 --> 2:39:38.040]  bisphenol-A is baking into the food.
[2:39:38.040 --> 2:39:40.200]  Just for that purpose, I brought these over here.
[2:39:40.200 --> 2:39:42.000]  These are microwaved foods.
[2:39:42.000 --> 2:39:45.080]  I mean, not only do you destroy all the nutrients
[2:39:45.080 --> 2:39:47.760]  by cooking your food in the microwave,
[2:39:47.760 --> 2:39:48.800]  but you also get-
[2:39:48.800 --> 2:39:50.400]  Why are you being homophobic?
[2:39:50.400 --> 2:39:52.440]  Why are you warning folks that'll give them breast cancer?
[2:39:52.440 --> 2:39:53.840]  Why are you warning them bisphenol-A is connected
[2:39:53.840 --> 2:39:54.680]  to breast cancer?
[2:39:54.680 --> 2:39:56.880]  Why do you hate gay children?
[2:39:56.880 --> 2:39:58.640]  It's all about helping the public.
[2:39:58.640 --> 2:40:00.280]  No, no, but I don't need to argue with you.
[2:40:00.280 --> 2:40:01.560]  I'll just say you're racist.
[2:40:01.560 --> 2:40:02.440]  Why are you racist?
[2:40:02.440 --> 2:40:06.600]  In fact, in fact, there's gotta be browns somewhere.
[2:40:06.600 --> 2:40:09.320]  They said brown bags are racist and are banned in Seattle.
[2:40:09.320 --> 2:40:10.760]  Is there something brown in this room?
[2:40:10.760 --> 2:40:12.080]  We gotta get rid of these maps on the wall.
[2:40:12.080 --> 2:40:13.880]  They're kind of light brown.
[2:40:13.880 --> 2:40:15.680]  Over here, gotta get rid of those.
[2:40:15.680 --> 2:40:17.000]  Sorry, sorry, Dr. Grip, go ahead.
[2:40:17.000 --> 2:40:20.200]  Well, okay, so you know how many digestive problems there are
[2:40:20.200 --> 2:40:22.200]  because the intestines are the endocrine gland,
[2:40:22.200 --> 2:40:25.280]  and how many people do you know that take antacids?
[2:40:25.280 --> 2:40:27.080]  I mean, I know people that pop these things,
[2:40:27.080 --> 2:40:29.440]  you know, 10 or 15 a day.
[2:40:29.440 --> 2:40:30.280]  Antacids-
[2:40:30.280 --> 2:40:32.560]  And your body just creates more acid to counter it.
[2:40:32.560 --> 2:40:34.000]  Yeah, not only that,
[2:40:34.000 --> 2:40:37.120]  but there's endocrine disrupting compounds inside of these,
[2:40:37.120 --> 2:40:39.960]  the fillers and the toxic substances they use.
[2:40:39.960 --> 2:40:40.800]  Why are you being racist?
[2:40:40.800 --> 2:40:41.920]  And the dyes as well.
[2:40:41.920 --> 2:40:44.200]  The dyes actually cause a negative response.
[2:40:44.200 --> 2:40:46.520]  So mineral oil that you put on babies
[2:40:46.520 --> 2:40:50.000]  actually contains fragrances and phthalates are used.
[2:40:50.000 --> 2:40:52.600]  Phthalates are endocrine disrupting chemicals
[2:40:52.600 --> 2:40:55.240]  that are used to carry fragrances.
[2:40:55.240 --> 2:40:57.800]  And that fragrances are extremely toxic
[2:40:57.800 --> 2:41:01.120]  and cause increased estrogen and low-testosterone in males.
[2:41:01.120 --> 2:41:03.520]  And these people are putting this on their babies,
[2:41:03.520 --> 2:41:06.200]  and not only that, you have the laundry detergent
[2:41:06.200 --> 2:41:08.360]  which has high levels of fragrances in it.
[2:41:08.360 --> 2:41:13.360]  You have the fragrant drying strips
[2:41:13.520 --> 2:41:15.640]  that people put in their dryers for their clothes.
[2:41:15.640 --> 2:41:18.160]  All these fragrances and phthalates get put in the clothes
[2:41:18.160 --> 2:41:21.480]  and then you sweat and they come in through your skin.
[2:41:21.480 --> 2:41:22.800]  You also have in the house,
[2:41:22.800 --> 2:41:25.040]  most shampoos and conditioners
[2:41:25.040 --> 2:41:26.920]  have high levels of parabens in them.
[2:41:26.920 --> 2:41:29.520]  They have high levels of endocrine disrupting chemicals.
[2:41:29.520 --> 2:41:31.280]  The lotions that you pile on your body-
[2:41:31.280 --> 2:41:34.280]  Well, that's where they have a lot of distillates from well refining.
[2:41:34.280 --> 2:41:35.520]  And so they got to put them somewhere.
[2:41:35.520 --> 2:41:36.800]  So in the 30s on record,
[2:41:36.800 --> 2:41:37.880]  they engineered a whole society,
[2:41:37.880 --> 2:41:40.560]  your dad was a chemist that did that,
[2:41:40.560 --> 2:41:42.680]  to then put it into other products.
[2:41:42.680 --> 2:41:45.320]  And look, I'm not against oil overall,
[2:41:45.320 --> 2:41:46.360]  but I don't want to eat it.
[2:41:46.360 --> 2:41:47.320]  It's like benzene.
[2:41:47.320 --> 2:41:50.480]  I mean, they had so much benzene in petroleum production
[2:41:50.480 --> 2:41:52.640]  that they had to figure out what to do with it.
[2:41:52.640 --> 2:41:54.280]  And benzene is extremely toxic.
[2:41:54.280 --> 2:41:57.960]  And so they put it, they mix it with fluorobenzines
[2:41:57.960 --> 2:42:00.440]  and other compounds, which are dioxins
[2:42:00.440 --> 2:42:02.080]  or volatile or-
[2:42:02.080 --> 2:42:03.560]  Why are you being racist?
[2:42:03.560 --> 2:42:04.400]  That-
[2:42:04.400 --> 2:42:05.440]  Why are you being racist?
[2:42:06.440 --> 2:42:08.640]  Even though Monsanto dumped in the black neighborhoods,
[2:42:08.640 --> 2:42:10.320]  the dioxins and killed tens of thousands of people
[2:42:10.320 --> 2:42:11.160]  and covered it up.
[2:42:11.160 --> 2:42:14.280]  Still, it's racist that you don't want to kill black people.
[2:42:14.280 --> 2:42:15.400]  I don't even know what to say.
[2:42:15.400 --> 2:42:16.760]  Well, no, I mean, just the new thing is
[2:42:16.760 --> 2:42:17.960]  I just counter with your racist.
[2:42:17.960 --> 2:42:18.800]  Oh, I know.
[2:42:18.800 --> 2:42:19.640]  I see it on YouTube.
[2:42:19.640 --> 2:42:21.640]  I'll be talking about weather modification.
[2:42:21.640 --> 2:42:23.280]  Let's say this guy's a racist.
[2:42:23.280 --> 2:42:24.120]  Right.
[2:42:24.120 --> 2:42:25.280]  So just that that's my new thing I counter you.
[2:42:25.280 --> 2:42:26.120]  Exactly.
[2:42:26.120 --> 2:42:27.160]  When a cop pulls me over to write me a ticket,
[2:42:27.160 --> 2:42:28.680]  I'm gonna go racist.
[2:42:28.680 --> 2:42:30.560]  You're gonna say, why is it racist?
[2:42:30.560 --> 2:42:31.560]  It's just what you respond with.
[2:42:31.560 --> 2:42:32.400]  Okay. All right.
[2:42:32.400 --> 2:42:34.560]  Well, I am a racist against all these things
[2:42:34.560 --> 2:42:35.560]  because they're killing everyone.
[2:42:35.560 --> 2:42:36.400]  That's right.
[2:42:36.400 --> 2:42:37.680]  You're discriminating against chemicals.
[2:42:37.680 --> 2:42:39.200]  Why are you hating?
[2:42:39.200 --> 2:42:40.560]  Why are you hating?
[2:42:40.560 --> 2:42:42.240]  I'm hating because they're killing.
[2:42:42.240 --> 2:42:44.240]  And when they're killing, then I'm hating.
[2:42:44.240 --> 2:42:45.640]  When they're killing, you're illing?
[2:42:45.640 --> 2:42:47.800]  When I'm killing, yeah, exactly.
[2:42:47.800 --> 2:42:50.360]  So I mean, even feminine hygiene products
[2:42:50.360 --> 2:42:52.960]  are bleached with different types of dioxins and chemicals.
[2:42:52.960 --> 2:42:57.720]  It can cause toxic shock syndrome, aluminum, again, deodorants.
[2:42:57.720 --> 2:42:59.680]  Are you hating all the silver people?
[2:42:59.680 --> 2:43:00.520]  I am.
[2:43:00.520 --> 2:43:01.480]  What's wrong with 10-Foil?
[2:43:01.480 --> 2:43:02.320]  Here, let me have it.
[2:43:02.320 --> 2:43:04.160]  They don't put that on.
[2:43:04.160 --> 2:43:05.680]  I need to with all the cell phone radiation.
[2:43:05.680 --> 2:43:07.000]  But then, yeah, then you're gonna get
[2:43:07.000 --> 2:43:08.360]  all the electromagnetic radiation
[2:43:08.360 --> 2:43:10.320]  coming right into your mind there.
[2:43:10.320 --> 2:43:11.160]  Actually, this will increase it, right?
[2:43:11.160 --> 2:43:14.920]  Then you're getting aluminum put into your brain again.
[2:43:14.920 --> 2:43:17.440]  As a matter of fact, most pharmaceutical drugs,
[2:43:17.440 --> 2:43:19.320]  including what you were talking about earlier,
[2:43:19.320 --> 2:43:20.840]  the vaccinations and the food shots
[2:43:20.840 --> 2:43:23.080]  that have aluminum in them.
[2:43:23.080 --> 2:43:24.640]  And people wonder why.
[2:43:24.640 --> 2:43:26.880]  They're killing myself right now.
[2:43:26.880 --> 2:43:28.080]  My kids are getting sick.
[2:43:28.080 --> 2:43:32.600]  I might as well spray some of these toxic chemicals on you
[2:43:32.600 --> 2:43:34.920]  as well that are insect repellents.
[2:43:34.920 --> 2:43:38.040]  Insect repellents people lather themselves with.
[2:43:39.320 --> 2:43:42.040]  And then you can protect your head from the sun
[2:43:42.040 --> 2:43:42.920]  so you don't get...
[2:43:42.920 --> 2:43:44.040]  See how fast I did that?
[2:43:44.040 --> 2:43:45.240]  Folks, I'm an expert.
[2:43:45.240 --> 2:43:47.640]  Every day when I leave work, I do this.
[2:43:47.640 --> 2:43:48.640]  Let's do a wide shot, guys.
[2:43:48.640 --> 2:43:49.880]  People don't see the full power.
[2:43:49.880 --> 2:43:54.880]  So you might as well drink some BPA water while you're at it.
[2:43:56.880 --> 2:43:58.360]  Then you can go ahead and do a detox
[2:43:58.360 --> 2:43:59.880]  and start cleaning yourself out later
[2:43:59.880 --> 2:44:01.960]  and neutralizing all the aluminum.
[2:44:01.960 --> 2:44:04.720]  So anyway, soups, cans.
[2:44:04.720 --> 2:44:07.640]  I mean, the bottom line is go through your house
[2:44:07.640 --> 2:44:10.920]  and find all these things and eliminate them at the source
[2:44:10.920 --> 2:44:13.920]  because you really need to figure out
[2:44:13.920 --> 2:44:15.760]  what's causing all these problems.
[2:44:15.760 --> 2:44:18.760]  It's about addressing the root cause of the problem
[2:44:18.760 --> 2:44:21.080]  as well as using the type of supplements
[2:44:21.080 --> 2:44:23.040]  that we have to balance your hormones naturally
[2:44:23.040 --> 2:44:25.120]  and balance out your body naturally.
[2:44:25.120 --> 2:44:28.360]  I can get Obama's emergency alerts through this.
[2:44:28.360 --> 2:44:30.160]  Now when he comes and takes over my cell phone
[2:44:30.160 --> 2:44:32.640]  with my sand sun TVs watching me,
[2:44:32.640 --> 2:44:34.120]  it's okay to wear a tin full hat now
[2:44:34.120 --> 2:44:36.160]  because it's as many of the TVs watching us now.
[2:44:36.160 --> 2:44:37.880]  I actually like it now.
[2:44:37.880 --> 2:44:38.720]  Are you...
[2:44:38.720 --> 2:44:40.440]  Maybe you'll actually believe what he's saying.
[2:44:40.440 --> 2:44:42.080]  Like when he came out the other day and said,
[2:44:42.080 --> 2:44:46.080]  oh, I think every child should be vaccinated.
[2:44:46.080 --> 2:44:49.320]  You know, there's enough scientific evidence behind it.
[2:44:49.320 --> 2:44:50.360]  There's no side effects.
[2:44:50.360 --> 2:44:51.200]  Yeah, it doesn't matter.
[2:44:51.200 --> 2:44:52.040]  The insert says it can kill you.
[2:44:52.040 --> 2:44:53.120]  No, I agree.
[2:44:53.120 --> 2:44:53.960]  Yeah.
[2:44:53.960 --> 2:44:55.280]  I love this.
[2:44:55.280 --> 2:44:57.160]  In fact, I love the system.
[2:44:57.160 --> 2:44:58.880]  I can now remove the tin full hat.
[2:45:00.560 --> 2:45:02.600]  The crown of power.
[2:45:02.600 --> 2:45:05.080]  And now you are controllable because you have...
[2:45:05.080 --> 2:45:06.360]  It's like a medieval visor.
[2:45:06.360 --> 2:45:08.440]  Frying your brain cells.
[2:45:08.440 --> 2:45:09.280]  Paying for battle.
[2:45:09.280 --> 2:45:13.440]  Now you'll have to take the oxypowder
[2:45:13.440 --> 2:45:15.080]  and all of the fluoride shield.
[2:45:15.080 --> 2:45:16.320]  By the way, I got to say this,
[2:45:16.320 --> 2:45:18.520]  when we go to anything good you already can get serious.
[2:45:18.520 --> 2:45:19.840]  I got to stop this right here.
[2:45:19.840 --> 2:45:22.760]  I'm just giving my enemies photo op stuff on purpose
[2:45:22.760 --> 2:45:24.920]  because we know their attacks actually help us.
[2:45:24.920 --> 2:45:26.160]  So we appreciate all that.
[2:45:29.480 --> 2:45:30.640]  But what happens when they figure out
[2:45:30.640 --> 2:45:32.000]  their attacks are feeble,
[2:45:32.000 --> 2:45:33.120]  then they might do some other attacks
[2:45:33.120 --> 2:45:35.080]  that we figured out might actually work.
[2:45:35.080 --> 2:45:35.920]  That's what I'm worried about.
[2:45:35.920 --> 2:45:39.000]  But analyze the enemy attack profile, Lord Grip.
[2:45:39.960 --> 2:45:41.120]  Getting serious here.
[2:45:43.080 --> 2:45:44.760]  What do you make of the full court press
[2:45:44.760 --> 2:45:47.160]  or forced inoculation that's going on right now?
[2:45:48.400 --> 2:45:49.240]  That's scary.
[2:45:52.160 --> 2:45:54.840]  I, you know, you can just, in plain sight,
[2:45:54.840 --> 2:45:57.200]  you can see what they're trying to do.
[2:45:57.200 --> 2:45:58.440]  They're trying to say, you know,
[2:45:58.440 --> 2:46:01.320]  they're trying to blame it on the unvaccinated children.
[2:46:01.320 --> 2:46:03.720]  There's a push for mandatory vaccinations.
[2:46:03.720 --> 2:46:04.960]  I mean, they're trying to convince everybody.
[2:46:04.960 --> 2:46:07.680]  Even though people that have the shot are getting the measles.
[2:46:07.680 --> 2:46:08.520]  That's right.
[2:46:08.520 --> 2:46:11.000]  Just two plus two does not equal five.
[2:46:11.000 --> 2:46:13.680]  You know, the natural way that a child,
[2:46:13.680 --> 2:46:16.960]  I talked to the parents that have unvaccinated children.
[2:46:16.960 --> 2:46:20.720]  And what happens is all the vaccinated children,
[2:46:20.720 --> 2:46:23.160]  see, they don't do stories on all the vaccinated children,
[2:46:23.160 --> 2:46:26.080]  getting all the unvaccinated children sick all the time.
[2:46:26.080 --> 2:46:28.800]  But usually what happens, and this is a pattern,
[2:46:28.800 --> 2:46:31.360]  the unvaccinated children will naturally,
[2:46:31.360 --> 2:46:33.600]  because the way that they're designing the flu shot
[2:46:33.600 --> 2:46:38.520]  and you can get flu shots and vaccines at, you know,
[2:46:38.520 --> 2:46:41.400]  fast food restaurants sometimes now.
[2:46:41.400 --> 2:46:42.240]  And-
[2:46:42.240 --> 2:46:43.880]  Why are you hating on McDonald's?
[2:46:43.880 --> 2:46:45.040]  Why are you hating on the yellow arches?
[2:46:45.040 --> 2:46:45.880]  Because they're-
[2:46:45.880 --> 2:46:47.240]  You're getting insane, people.
[2:46:47.240 --> 2:46:52.240]  Because they're giving kids vaccinations
[2:46:52.480 --> 2:46:53.680]  that are hexavalent.
[2:46:53.680 --> 2:46:55.240]  They're mixing them all together now.
[2:46:55.240 --> 2:46:56.080]  Obviously deadly.
[2:46:56.080 --> 2:46:58.880]  There's so many of them together in one shot.
[2:46:58.880 --> 2:47:03.680]  And now the kids, at least the unvaccinated kids,
[2:47:03.680 --> 2:47:06.880]  you know, years ago, how did we develop our immune system?
[2:47:06.880 --> 2:47:10.080]  Okay, we were out there gathering fruit off the ground,
[2:47:10.080 --> 2:47:14.320]  touching bird poop, you know, picking apples off the tree,
[2:47:14.320 --> 2:47:17.040]  never washing our hands and eating it,
[2:47:17.040 --> 2:47:19.040]  and we would develop immunity.
[2:47:19.040 --> 2:47:20.720]  And, you know, now you're in a society
[2:47:20.720 --> 2:47:22.840]  where people are like, wash your hands, little-
[2:47:22.840 --> 2:47:25.600]  Oh, they know now that it's just bubble syndrome
[2:47:25.600 --> 2:47:27.040]  of kids that aren't allowed to-
[2:47:27.040 --> 2:47:29.800]  My father had a black nanny.
[2:47:29.800 --> 2:47:30.720]  But no matter where she died,
[2:47:30.720 --> 2:47:31.800]  his little kid might have a going visitor
[2:47:31.800 --> 2:47:33.400]  when we go down to East Texas.
[2:47:33.400 --> 2:47:36.240]  And she said, Mrs. Jones, you're just keeping, you know,
[2:47:36.240 --> 2:47:37.640]  David too clean.
[2:47:37.640 --> 2:47:39.560]  And she convinced her, and the doctor actually agreed.
[2:47:39.560 --> 2:47:41.520]  No, no, Patty, you need to let him climb around the ground.
[2:47:41.520 --> 2:47:43.600]  And she was doing such a good job keeping him clean
[2:47:43.600 --> 2:47:44.880]  that he was getting sick.
[2:47:44.880 --> 2:47:48.120]  And then the black lady snuck off and boiled chicken poop
[2:47:48.120 --> 2:47:51.040]  with some other herbs, which gave him probiotics,
[2:47:51.040 --> 2:47:52.880]  and he was not sick anymore.
[2:47:52.880 --> 2:47:54.440]  And then she was, that's right, Mrs. Jones,
[2:47:54.440 --> 2:47:56.720]  I gave him the hindu tea and you can't stop me.
[2:47:56.720 --> 2:47:57.560]  That's right.
[2:47:57.560 --> 2:47:59.400]  I mean, it's because we've gotten away from all
[2:47:59.400 --> 2:48:04.400]  the old remedies of allowing somebody to be outside
[2:48:04.760 --> 2:48:07.560]  and developing immunity to their environment.
[2:48:07.560 --> 2:48:10.640]  And now really, really all these unvaccinated kids
[2:48:10.640 --> 2:48:11.680]  are vaccinated.
[2:48:11.680 --> 2:48:13.320]  They're just vaccinated secondarily
[2:48:13.320 --> 2:48:15.680]  because all the kids that go in and get the flu shot
[2:48:15.680 --> 2:48:19.760]  and the vaccinations spread the virus
[2:48:19.760 --> 2:48:23.120]  and all the other components to the unvaccinated kids
[2:48:23.120 --> 2:48:24.840]  through the air or through touching them
[2:48:24.840 --> 2:48:26.240]  through their skin or something like that.
[2:48:26.240 --> 2:48:27.080]  And then-
[2:48:27.080 --> 2:48:27.920]  You're right.
[2:48:27.920 --> 2:48:28.760]  I'm gonna skip this network break
[2:48:28.760 --> 2:48:29.600]  as I got to you late.
[2:48:29.600 --> 2:48:30.640]  And this is the last break I'm skipping on the week,
[2:48:30.640 --> 2:48:32.560]  John Harmey, you're not allowed to let me skip more breaks.
[2:48:32.560 --> 2:48:33.880]  I'm costing the network so much money
[2:48:33.880 --> 2:48:36.000]  and myself so much money, but I just do it.
[2:48:36.000 --> 2:48:37.120]  That's how obsessed with money I am.
[2:48:37.120 --> 2:48:38.360]  I skip like breaks every day
[2:48:38.360 --> 2:48:41.040]  that costs us like $3,000 each time.
[2:48:41.040 --> 2:48:42.200]  But this is so important.
[2:48:42.200 --> 2:48:44.240]  Anthony has been sitting in there waiting,
[2:48:44.240 --> 2:48:45.000]  chomping at the bed.
[2:48:45.000 --> 2:48:47.680]  He's the one that brought this Gizmodo Democratic Party,
[2:48:47.680 --> 2:48:50.680]  basically, peace to our attention
[2:48:50.680 --> 2:48:53.000]  with no proof that says there's probably rat poop
[2:48:53.000 --> 2:48:53.840]  in our stuff.
[2:48:53.840 --> 2:48:55.600]  I mean, how scared are they?
[2:48:55.600 --> 2:48:57.320]  Anthony, what are you things going on behind this?
[2:48:57.320 --> 2:49:00.240]  Because the attacks really are intensifying right now.
[2:49:00.240 --> 2:49:01.720]  Well, you notice the way they word it.
[2:49:01.720 --> 2:49:03.640]  They basically go in and say,
[2:49:03.640 --> 2:49:05.280]  oh yeah, they're selling iodine,
[2:49:05.280 --> 2:49:07.480]  which there's no evidence is actually good for you.
[2:49:07.480 --> 2:49:08.960]  But then they don't go into pub measures.
[2:49:08.960 --> 2:49:10.600]  By the way, the government admits you'll die.
[2:49:10.600 --> 2:49:11.600]  Yeah, sorry, go ahead.
[2:49:11.600 --> 2:49:12.520]  Yeah, I mean, in the 20s,
[2:49:12.520 --> 2:49:14.480]  they put it in the salt for a reason
[2:49:14.480 --> 2:49:16.520]  because they were saying even the World Health Organization
[2:49:16.520 --> 2:49:18.280]  goes out, they spend millions of dollars
[2:49:18.280 --> 2:49:20.000]  trying to get iodine in Africa
[2:49:20.000 --> 2:49:22.480]  and other third world nations and different areas
[2:49:22.480 --> 2:49:23.320]  and saying hey, if you have to take this.
[2:49:23.320 --> 2:49:25.680]  They found in China and like Brazil in places,
[2:49:25.680 --> 2:49:26.680]  you can look at the studies,
[2:49:26.680 --> 2:49:29.600]  just adding iodine has like made all these mental disorders
[2:49:29.600 --> 2:49:32.080]  and medical problems go down massively.
[2:49:32.080 --> 2:49:34.640]  They know, and then they go on and say,
[2:49:34.640 --> 2:49:36.760]  plus it's already in the salt, so you don't need it.
[2:49:36.760 --> 2:49:38.520]  No, it's been taken out of the salt.
[2:49:38.520 --> 2:49:40.160]  I mean, it's just lie after lie.
[2:49:40.160 --> 2:49:41.480]  Sorry, Anthony, I'm ranting.
[2:49:41.480 --> 2:49:42.600]  No, exactly.
[2:49:42.600 --> 2:49:45.320]  And they admit the number one cause of mental retardation
[2:49:45.320 --> 2:49:46.440]  is iodine deficiency.
[2:49:46.440 --> 2:49:48.920]  And they also say in Japan, make sure you take your iodine.
[2:49:48.920 --> 2:49:50.400]  And as Dr. Yu could tell you,
[2:49:50.400 --> 2:49:53.360]  they've been taking thousands and thousands of micrograms
[2:49:53.360 --> 2:49:55.280]  of iodine a day and preparing themselves.
[2:49:55.280 --> 2:49:57.480]  Fukushima disaster, they're dispersing it everywhere
[2:49:57.480 --> 2:49:59.600]  saying take this and admitting it's going
[2:49:59.600 --> 2:50:01.200]  into United States on the West Coast
[2:50:01.200 --> 2:50:03.840]  or having radioactive CCM all across the West Coast
[2:50:03.840 --> 2:50:04.680]  in California.
[2:50:04.680 --> 2:50:07.160]  And they admit this article that it can make you hyper.
[2:50:07.160 --> 2:50:08.800]  Well, yeah, if you get too much it can,
[2:50:08.800 --> 2:50:10.920]  but if you don't get enough, you're gonna be a slug.
[2:50:10.920 --> 2:50:12.280]  This country's full of slugs.
[2:50:12.280 --> 2:50:14.480]  But here's the real, real, real scam
[2:50:14.480 --> 2:50:17.240]  and why this article overall is very concerning.
[2:50:17.240 --> 2:50:20.000]  Because they're not talking about the iodine
[2:50:20.000 --> 2:50:24.240]  we're taking from 8,000 feet under the earth's center
[2:50:24.240 --> 2:50:25.560]  and getting the actual salt.
[2:50:25.560 --> 2:50:27.560]  That no one else has, that no one else has.
[2:50:27.560 --> 2:50:28.400]  They're not talking about that.
[2:50:28.400 --> 2:50:30.000]  They're saying it's the same as table salt.
[2:50:30.000 --> 2:50:31.480]  And then they're going on Wikipedia
[2:50:31.480 --> 2:50:33.640]  and looking up iodine, the raw form
[2:50:33.640 --> 2:50:35.080]  which if you actually touch the raw form
[2:50:35.080 --> 2:50:36.280]  it'll burn through your skin
[2:50:36.280 --> 2:50:37.720]  and saying, see, it's deadly.
[2:50:37.720 --> 2:50:39.240]  You can't even touch it.
[2:50:39.240 --> 2:50:43.520]  It's 101 on just totally dismantling.
[2:50:43.520 --> 2:50:44.920]  And by the way, it is deadly
[2:50:44.920 --> 2:50:46.400]  until we shoot it with the gas
[2:50:46.400 --> 2:50:49.720]  and these big machines and the patents into the palm oil.
[2:50:49.720 --> 2:50:50.760]  And that's the whole point is
[2:50:50.760 --> 2:50:53.760]  is then in your body the natural way to pull everything out.
[2:50:53.760 --> 2:50:54.960]  And let's just put it like this.
[2:50:54.960 --> 2:50:56.680]  How about you idiots at Gizmodo
[2:50:56.680 --> 2:50:58.480]  will send you some bottles and do a real review.
[2:50:58.480 --> 2:51:00.760]  I mean, this stuff changed my life.
[2:51:00.760 --> 2:51:03.280]  People deserve to get this, you turds.
[2:51:03.280 --> 2:51:05.040]  I mean, do you really want to be evil?
[2:51:05.040 --> 2:51:05.880]  You really want to tell people
[2:51:05.880 --> 2:51:09.000]  this feeling all the way in bad and make fun of me?
[2:51:09.000 --> 2:51:11.400]  Like the Gawker, by the way,
[2:51:11.400 --> 2:51:13.680]  you guys did find it in Gawker, my memory was right.
[2:51:13.680 --> 2:51:16.800]  But isn't Gizmodo connected to Gawker?
[2:51:16.800 --> 2:51:18.560]  Is my memory correct?
[2:51:18.560 --> 2:51:19.400]  Did we check that?
[2:51:19.400 --> 2:51:20.240]  Yes, it is correct.
[2:51:20.240 --> 2:51:21.080]  It is correct.
[2:51:21.080 --> 2:51:22.760]  Okay, I just checked my memory every time.
[2:51:22.760 --> 2:51:23.960]  Sorry, go ahead, Anthony.
[2:51:23.960 --> 2:51:25.240]  And let's just put it like this
[2:51:25.240 --> 2:51:26.880]  and we haven't decided to come out
[2:51:26.880 --> 2:51:28.120]  and even talk about this kind of stuff
[2:51:28.120 --> 2:51:29.520]  but we're working with manufacturers
[2:51:29.520 --> 2:51:31.080]  that are doing billions and billions of dollars
[2:51:31.080 --> 2:51:33.000]  supplying whole foods, everything.
[2:51:33.000 --> 2:51:35.040]  And they've said they've never seen anyone go
[2:51:35.040 --> 2:51:35.880]  for quality as well.
[2:51:35.880 --> 2:51:36.720]  Never seen it.
[2:51:36.720 --> 2:51:38.400]  All their biochemists, nutritionists that work for them,
[2:51:38.400 --> 2:51:40.120]  everything they're saying, can we please buy this?
[2:51:40.120 --> 2:51:41.680]  Can we please private label it?
[2:51:41.680 --> 2:51:43.000]  We'll just buy any amount you want.
[2:51:43.000 --> 2:51:45.480]  We've had shampoo, major shampoo groups
[2:51:45.480 --> 2:51:46.680]  that we won't talk about come and say,
[2:51:46.680 --> 2:51:48.920]  hey, we found this is amazing for the hair.
[2:51:48.920 --> 2:51:50.720]  We need to buy massive millions of gallons.
[2:51:50.720 --> 2:51:51.560]  And then we didn't do it.
[2:51:51.560 --> 2:51:54.160]  So they just bypassed us and now we have the DEA
[2:51:54.160 --> 2:51:55.280]  trying to shut us down.
[2:51:55.280 --> 2:51:56.480]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[2:51:56.480 --> 2:51:58.200]  But then we ended up finding even better source
[2:51:58.200 --> 2:51:59.040]  because of that.
[2:52:00.480 --> 2:52:01.640]  Sorry, go ahead, Anthony, I'm ranting.
[2:52:01.640 --> 2:52:02.480]  No, no, exactly.
[2:52:02.480 --> 2:52:03.320]  Go ahead.
[2:52:03.320 --> 2:52:04.160]  I was just saying that.
[2:52:04.160 --> 2:52:05.000]  They don't say much more.
[2:52:05.000 --> 2:52:05.840]  It's bad for you.
[2:52:05.840 --> 2:52:06.680]  PubMed doesn't exist.
[2:52:06.680 --> 2:52:08.320]  National Library of U.S. Medicine doesn't say
[2:52:08.320 --> 2:52:10.120]  that iodine is amazing and conquers
[2:52:10.120 --> 2:52:11.560]  multiple different issues.
[2:52:11.560 --> 2:52:14.160]  And of course, vitamin B is now bad too.
[2:52:14.160 --> 2:52:16.320]  Oh my God, look how much vitamin B there is.
[2:52:16.320 --> 2:52:18.520]  Yes, we give you actual real vitamin B
[2:52:18.520 --> 2:52:21.080]  and at a good value, a lot of different amounts.
[2:52:21.080 --> 2:52:23.360]  My gosh, it's the pharmaceutical grade.
[2:52:23.360 --> 2:52:24.440]  Oh, what are they doing?
[2:52:24.440 --> 2:52:25.360]  It's so evil.
[2:52:25.360 --> 2:52:26.680]  Oh my, that's so scary.
[2:52:26.680 --> 2:52:28.120]  FDA certified labs.
[2:52:28.120 --> 2:52:29.440]  I mean, if they actually looked into it,
[2:52:29.440 --> 2:52:31.160]  they would probably, you know what's funny though,
[2:52:31.160 --> 2:52:33.000]  most people will click on that and they'll end up buying it
[2:52:33.000 --> 2:52:34.160]  because they'll actually read the research
[2:52:34.160 --> 2:52:35.840]  and they'll figure it out.
[2:52:35.840 --> 2:52:37.160]  So the people reading that article
[2:52:37.160 --> 2:52:38.600]  have already determined what they're going to do.
[2:52:38.600 --> 2:52:40.240]  If they're reading that website in the first place
[2:52:40.240 --> 2:52:41.080]  and they go there every day,
[2:52:41.080 --> 2:52:43.960]  then chances are they're not gonna be helped regardless.
[2:52:43.960 --> 2:52:45.280]  But here's the thing.
[2:52:46.440 --> 2:52:48.280]  It's like Cass Sunstein at the White House says
[2:52:48.280 --> 2:52:51.040]  we must pass laws that you can't say you need sunlight.
[2:52:51.920 --> 2:52:54.240]  I mean, he actually said that in the New York Times.
[2:52:54.240 --> 2:52:56.400]  These people are bizarre.
[2:52:56.400 --> 2:52:59.640]  I'll tell you what, the sunscreen is just as bad
[2:52:59.640 --> 2:53:02.080]  when people put sunscreen on, it's sunscreen is bad.
[2:53:02.080 --> 2:53:03.080]  It's got aluminum dioxide, right?
[2:53:03.080 --> 2:53:07.560]  It's got all kinds of dioxins, chemicals in there
[2:53:07.560 --> 2:53:09.200]  that cause skin cancer.
[2:53:09.200 --> 2:53:11.480]  That's one of the worst things you can put on your skin.
[2:53:11.480 --> 2:53:13.320]  And so that's heavily promoted.
[2:53:13.320 --> 2:53:15.560]  I mean, it's attack from multiple angles.
[2:53:15.560 --> 2:53:16.400]  It's on purpose, that's what's crazy.
[2:53:16.400 --> 2:53:19.800]  And now the attack is on the best supplements
[2:53:19.800 --> 2:53:23.680]  because, you know, they know that they work
[2:53:23.680 --> 2:53:24.720]  and they know how big you are
[2:53:24.720 --> 2:53:26.320]  and they know how many people are gonna be out there
[2:53:26.320 --> 2:53:27.160]  getting better.
[2:53:27.160 --> 2:53:28.760]  I mean, the best sales pitch is the truth.
[2:53:28.760 --> 2:53:30.840]  We're gonna sell record amounts because of this.
[2:53:30.840 --> 2:53:32.600]  Because Gizmodo is a huge site.
[2:53:32.600 --> 2:53:34.360]  Thank you, Gizmodo, for lying about this.
[2:53:34.360 --> 2:53:35.200]  Thank you.
[2:53:35.200 --> 2:53:37.360]  And thank you for your parent company saying that
[2:53:37.360 --> 2:53:39.960]  Ms. Fiannale isn't bad for people and saying I'm a homophobe.
[2:53:39.960 --> 2:53:41.760]  Just cause people know the truth.
[2:53:41.760 --> 2:53:43.480]  So many listeners tune in, cause they go,
[2:53:43.480 --> 2:53:44.680]  I gotta hear this guy.
[2:53:44.680 --> 2:53:45.840]  And they tune in and they go look it up
[2:53:45.840 --> 2:53:47.560]  and they find it's true to other group.
[2:53:47.560 --> 2:53:48.400]  Of course.
[2:53:48.400 --> 2:53:49.240]  And they're not saying,
[2:53:49.240 --> 2:53:51.400]  they couldn't even find one negative review
[2:53:51.400 --> 2:53:52.560]  or anything to put in there.
[2:53:52.560 --> 2:53:53.760]  They just made stuff up
[2:53:53.760 --> 2:53:54.920]  and they're not gonna be able to find it.
[2:53:54.920 --> 2:53:56.200]  Where's the rat poop part?
[2:53:56.200 --> 2:53:59.360]  I mean, where do they get that?
[2:53:59.360 --> 2:54:00.240]  Buckley said that.
[2:54:00.240 --> 2:54:01.160]  I couldn't read the whole thing.
[2:54:01.160 --> 2:54:02.920]  Oh, they put a picture of me acting silly.
[2:54:02.920 --> 2:54:05.240]  That really proves it's all.
[2:54:05.240 --> 2:54:06.080]  You know what?
[2:54:06.080 --> 2:54:07.320]  I'm real, folks.
[2:54:07.320 --> 2:54:08.160]  Everybody knows it.
[2:54:08.160 --> 2:54:09.920]  I was saying Kiyosaki's name wrong earlier.
[2:54:09.920 --> 2:54:11.360]  I mean, so what?
[2:54:11.360 --> 2:54:15.320]  I'm not trying to like frame what I say here.
[2:54:15.320 --> 2:54:16.200]  That's the thing.
[2:54:16.200 --> 2:54:18.600]  I mean, when you're honest and you're real
[2:54:18.600 --> 2:54:20.240]  and you actually care
[2:54:20.240 --> 2:54:22.600]  and you actually devoted your life
[2:54:22.600 --> 2:54:25.560]  to make a difference in everybody else's life.
[2:54:25.560 --> 2:54:28.480]  I mean, I've spent 20 years identifying
[2:54:28.480 --> 2:54:30.000]  all the things that they're doing
[2:54:30.000 --> 2:54:31.320]  and trying to get it all down.
[2:54:31.320 --> 2:54:33.480]  The special ingredient doesn't have to have any,
[2:54:33.480 --> 2:54:34.800]  we won't say special ingredient,
[2:54:34.800 --> 2:54:35.640]  level of purity.
[2:54:35.640 --> 2:54:37.360]  The ingredient may contain rat poop.
[2:54:39.800 --> 2:54:42.160]  I don't know where they're coming up with that.
[2:54:42.160 --> 2:54:45.000]  I mean, the processing that we use
[2:54:45.000 --> 2:54:46.480]  is all in sealed glass,
[2:54:46.480 --> 2:54:49.680]  borosilicate glass containers and mixing vessels.
[2:54:49.680 --> 2:54:50.680]  And let me tell you, I've-
[2:54:50.680 --> 2:54:51.520]  How do we know that anyway?
[2:54:51.520 --> 2:54:52.880]  It shouldn't get in there.
[2:54:52.880 --> 2:54:57.000]  I've toured many manufacturing facilities
[2:54:57.000 --> 2:55:00.360]  and everybody in ours is all organic from the ground up.
[2:55:00.360 --> 2:55:01.400]  Well, we've shown video of it.
[2:55:01.400 --> 2:55:02.240]  Yeah, you've seen it.
[2:55:02.240 --> 2:55:04.080]  Yeah, I'm not even...
[2:55:04.080 --> 2:55:06.640]  What manufacturing facility is gonna show you videos
[2:55:06.640 --> 2:55:07.800]  throughout the whole facility
[2:55:07.800 --> 2:55:09.400]  and what they're manufacturing it in?
[2:55:09.400 --> 2:55:11.440]  Nobody's going to do that.
[2:55:11.440 --> 2:55:12.280]  You know, we actually-
[2:55:12.280 --> 2:55:13.800]  Except racist.
[2:55:13.800 --> 2:55:16.760]  We take the extra time and care to ensure
[2:55:16.760 --> 2:55:21.040]  that we have the best quality products all the time
[2:55:21.040 --> 2:55:23.120]  that are going to actually make a difference.
[2:55:23.120 --> 2:55:24.960]  Because we wanna have high quality products
[2:55:24.960 --> 2:55:27.400]  that people love and stand government scrutiny
[2:55:27.400 --> 2:55:28.920]  to the highest level.
[2:55:28.920 --> 2:55:30.800]  Win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win.
[2:55:30.800 --> 2:55:33.520]  And so we love these attacks, just another joke.
[2:55:33.520 --> 2:55:34.440]  It's just another attack.
[2:55:34.440 --> 2:55:35.800]  I mean, we've been under attack,
[2:55:35.800 --> 2:55:37.280]  been under attack for 20 years.
[2:55:37.280 --> 2:55:39.640]  You've been under attack for a long time.
[2:55:39.640 --> 2:55:40.480]  20 years.
[2:55:40.480 --> 2:55:42.440]  20 years and it's just another attack.
[2:55:42.440 --> 2:55:43.920]  Anthony, why do you think the attacks
[2:55:43.920 --> 2:55:46.040]  are intensifying so bad?
[2:55:46.040 --> 2:55:47.160]  Well, you know, at this point,
[2:55:47.160 --> 2:55:49.760]  I think it's obvious that someone has made the call
[2:55:49.760 --> 2:55:52.000]  from the copyright claims that are just ridiculous
[2:55:52.000 --> 2:55:53.600]  coming in every single day for some reason
[2:55:53.600 --> 2:55:55.520]  after they hadn't come in for years
[2:55:55.520 --> 2:55:57.360]  to the random attack pieces that we see,
[2:55:57.360 --> 2:55:59.440]  even on some weird blog websites or anything like that.
[2:55:59.440 --> 2:56:01.960]  I think someone has decided it looks like-
[2:56:01.960 --> 2:56:03.280]  We know, they're mad about,
[2:56:03.280 --> 2:56:05.800]  this last time this happened was when we exposed H1N1.
[2:56:05.800 --> 2:56:08.240]  They're mad we're showing the inserts on air
[2:56:08.240 --> 2:56:09.440]  and trying to save people.
[2:56:09.440 --> 2:56:10.360]  Not because we're heroes,
[2:56:10.360 --> 2:56:11.680]  but because we don't want you brain damage
[2:56:11.680 --> 2:56:12.520]  or us brain damage.
[2:56:12.520 --> 2:56:13.360]  Well, it's obviously-
[2:56:13.360 --> 2:56:16.440]  In fact, I want full coverage of the measles.
[2:56:16.440 --> 2:56:17.880]  I want full, I wanna just,
[2:56:17.880 --> 2:56:20.400]  I just wanna have 24 seven showing the inserts
[2:56:20.400 --> 2:56:21.240]  that they hate it.
[2:56:21.240 --> 2:56:22.360]  We're just gonna keep doing it.
[2:56:22.360 --> 2:56:23.200]  The more you attack us,
[2:56:23.200 --> 2:56:24.880]  the more we show the inserts, just keep it up.
[2:56:24.880 --> 2:56:27.960]  We're directly over enemy targets right now, gentlemen.
[2:56:27.960 --> 2:56:28.800]  That's right.
[2:56:28.800 --> 2:56:29.960]  All you can do is just keep showing people
[2:56:29.960 --> 2:56:31.880]  and keep showing people and keep showing people
[2:56:31.880 --> 2:56:33.640]  all the information that you have
[2:56:33.640 --> 2:56:34.640]  and letting people go.
[2:56:34.640 --> 2:56:37.880]  It's not like what we're saying over here is not the truth.
[2:56:37.880 --> 2:56:39.640]  We've got all the research.
[2:56:39.640 --> 2:56:43.000]  I mean, each one of these endocrine disrupting chemicals.
[2:56:43.000 --> 2:56:46.160]  I mean, this is all stuff that every family has
[2:56:46.160 --> 2:56:48.480]  in their house that they've been convinced to buy
[2:56:48.480 --> 2:56:51.160]  through commercials at the grocery stores
[2:56:51.160 --> 2:56:54.160]  because that's all the grocery stores will sell is toxic.
[2:56:54.160 --> 2:56:55.000]  And I mean-
[2:56:55.000 --> 2:56:58.080]  And we're displacing that now by buying with our dollars.
[2:56:58.080 --> 2:56:59.600]  So they're demonizing the food, baby.
[2:56:59.600 --> 2:57:00.440]  They're demonizing you.
[2:57:00.440 --> 2:57:01.560]  They're demonizing Ron Paul.
[2:57:01.560 --> 2:57:03.280]  They're demonizing Rand Paul.
[2:57:03.280 --> 2:57:05.000]  And they got all these purists attacking Rand Paul
[2:57:05.000 --> 2:57:06.000]  because he's not perfect.
[2:57:06.000 --> 2:57:08.080]  Hey, I'm gonna do five minutes overdrive.
[2:57:08.080 --> 2:57:09.320]  I wanna thank all of our affiliates.
[2:57:09.320 --> 2:57:11.760]  Spread the word about every affiliate now.
[2:57:11.760 --> 2:57:13.120]  We are really having a big effect.
[2:57:13.120 --> 2:57:14.080]  Thank those affiliates.
[2:57:14.080 --> 2:57:15.320]  We're growing really fast.
[2:57:15.320 --> 2:57:16.520]  The enemy is scared.
[2:57:16.520 --> 2:57:17.440]  They're collapsing.
[2:57:17.440 --> 2:57:19.520]  They're a bunch of Brian Williams scum.
[2:57:19.520 --> 2:57:20.360]  Stay with us.
[2:57:20.360 --> 2:57:24.080]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[2:57:27.080 --> 2:57:30.480]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day.
[2:57:30.480 --> 2:57:34.000]  Big heart-shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[2:57:34.000 --> 2:57:36.480]  What if we the Patriots hijacked Valentine's Day
[2:57:36.480 --> 2:57:38.600]  and instead made it about human liberty
[2:57:38.600 --> 2:57:40.040]  and individual empowerment?
[2:57:40.040 --> 2:57:41.440]  I'm all about human potential.
[2:57:41.440 --> 2:57:43.680]  I'm all about the individual being empowered.
[2:57:43.680 --> 2:57:45.240]  The establishment is the opposite.
[2:57:45.240 --> 2:57:47.400]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride,
[2:57:47.400 --> 2:57:49.960]  and GMO, estrogen mimickers, and the rest of the garbage.
[2:57:49.960 --> 2:57:52.840]  Info Wars is striking back in the month of February
[2:57:52.840 --> 2:57:54.600]  with Human Empowerment Month.

[2:58:29.640 --> 2:58:32.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:58:39.880 --> 2:58:42.120]  From his Central Texas Command Center,
[2:58:42.120 --> 2:58:46.480]  geek behind enemy lines, the information war continued.
[2:58:46.480 --> 2:58:49.880]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:58:54.720 --> 2:58:57.120]  Final segment with the head of the Global Healing Center,
[2:58:57.120 --> 2:59:00.480]  Global Healing Center, visit.com, excellent website.
[2:59:00.480 --> 2:59:02.680]  He's behind a lot of the products like X2,
[2:59:02.680 --> 2:59:04.880]  Super Male, Super Female Vitality,
[2:59:04.880 --> 2:59:05.720]  so many other products.
[2:59:05.720 --> 2:59:08.440]  He helped us, advised us, and told us honestly,
[2:59:08.440 --> 2:59:11.520]  DNA force, and look, he's just funding our operation.
[2:59:11.520 --> 2:59:13.440]  And you can see the enemy attacking us.
[2:59:13.440 --> 2:59:14.960]  Of course, frankly, I'm a man.
[2:59:14.960 --> 2:59:16.680]  I'm not anything special, I'm a man.
[2:59:16.680 --> 2:59:18.000]  I know I'm doing the right thing.
[2:59:18.000 --> 2:59:19.840]  I don't want to die, I don't look forward to it,
[2:59:19.840 --> 2:59:22.560]  but I'll walk out of my house and some guy pulls a gun
[2:59:22.560 --> 2:59:24.040]  and shoots me from the government.
[2:59:24.040 --> 2:59:25.600]  I'm just kind of like, well, I didn't want to die,
[2:59:25.600 --> 2:59:27.120]  but hope my kids are all right,
[2:59:27.120 --> 2:59:30.360]  but I'm about to get the big vacation.
[2:59:30.360 --> 2:59:32.160]  I'm not scared.
[2:59:32.160 --> 2:59:34.160]  I'm scared, though, of not doing the right job
[2:59:34.160 --> 2:59:36.560]  to maximize the platform we've got, Dr. Gribb,
[2:59:36.560 --> 2:59:37.840]  to warn people.
[2:59:37.840 --> 2:59:39.200]  All I can do is straight shoot, folks.
[2:59:39.200 --> 2:59:42.400]  That's all I got, because I'm a straight shooter.
[2:59:42.400 --> 2:59:44.440]  We've hardened this facility as well
[2:59:44.440 --> 2:59:47.440]  because of threats by ISIS and other scum,
[2:59:47.440 --> 2:59:49.440]  so we're also not going to roll over.
[2:59:49.440 --> 2:59:51.960]  But in closing, how do we save humanity?
[2:59:51.960 --> 2:59:54.560]  How do we follow God's mission to empower people
[2:59:54.560 --> 2:59:57.640]  and bring the light of liberty and truth to them?
[2:59:57.640 --> 3:00:02.280]  Well, education number one, and really what I'm going to say,
[3:00:02.280 --> 3:00:04.520]  one of the methods that I firmly believe in
[3:00:04.520 --> 3:00:08.280]  is giving people the tools that they need to think clearly,
[3:00:08.280 --> 3:00:10.720]  to become healthy,
[3:00:10.720 --> 3:00:13.200]  because I believe that health equals self-confidence,
[3:00:13.200 --> 3:00:15.320]  and health confidence equals success.
[3:00:15.320 --> 3:00:19.120]  And that's why it's big for me to educate people,
[3:00:19.120 --> 3:00:23.360]  to understand the attack from all the different angles,
[3:00:23.360 --> 3:00:25.680]  from the water that they drink that's contaminated,
[3:00:25.680 --> 3:00:27.440]  from the air that they breathe,
[3:00:27.440 --> 3:00:29.080]  from the food that they eat,
[3:00:29.080 --> 3:00:30.520]  and give people the solutions,
[3:00:30.520 --> 3:00:32.600]  such as eating clean, organic food,
[3:00:32.600 --> 3:00:36.720]  drinking clean water, breathing clean air,
[3:00:36.720 --> 3:00:39.920]  all the things that we offer that are actually going to
[3:00:39.920 --> 3:00:42.240]  work from the inside out and combat.
[3:00:42.240 --> 3:00:44.160]  And as those people get better,
[3:00:44.160 --> 3:00:45.840]  they tell people the solutions,
[3:00:45.840 --> 3:00:47.240]  and then the word just keeps spreading
[3:00:47.240 --> 3:00:48.080]  and spreading.
[3:00:48.080 --> 3:00:49.400]  There's nothing like word of mouth.
[3:00:49.400 --> 3:00:51.320]  And look, I'm still a fat slob.
[3:00:51.320 --> 3:00:53.120]  I mean, I've lost probably 80% of my fat.
[3:00:53.120 --> 3:00:54.800]  I was almost 280.
[3:00:54.800 --> 3:00:57.120]  I'm down to below 230 something.
[3:00:57.120 --> 3:01:01.120]  But the difference is I feel great.
[3:01:01.120 --> 3:01:02.920]  I've got more energy, my brain works better.
[3:01:02.920 --> 3:01:05.000]  I mean, they don't want us to have that.
[3:01:05.000 --> 3:01:08.320]  It was like magic when I started taking the iodine.
[3:01:08.320 --> 3:01:09.800]  All these products are magical.
[3:01:09.800 --> 3:01:12.600]  I mean, it's not like you go to a drug store
[3:01:12.600 --> 3:01:16.200]  and you go down the aisle with 1,000 different
[3:01:16.200 --> 3:01:18.480]  dietary supplements, which are all crap.
[3:01:18.480 --> 3:01:21.240]  And you take them and you never feel anything.
[3:01:21.240 --> 3:01:22.960]  The way that these supplements are designed,
[3:01:22.960 --> 3:01:24.680]  there's different levels of supplements.
[3:01:24.680 --> 3:01:25.520]  And they're not synthetic.
[3:01:25.520 --> 3:01:27.040]  These are the Bentley,
[3:01:27.040 --> 3:01:28.880]  these aren't the tricycle of supplements.
[3:01:28.880 --> 3:01:31.880]  These are actually going to cause measurable.
[3:01:31.880 --> 3:01:35.120]  You take the oxypowder, it's just time released oxygen.
[3:01:35.120 --> 3:01:37.040]  You've got it all proprietary.
[3:01:37.040 --> 3:01:40.000]  People take and go, my God, you should hype this more.
[3:01:40.000 --> 3:01:41.880]  This is over the top.
[3:01:41.880 --> 3:01:44.400]  I mean, oxypowder at infowarslife.com.
[3:01:44.400 --> 3:01:47.840]  How many people do you know that go to work every day
[3:01:47.840 --> 3:01:49.400]  and come home and say,
[3:01:49.400 --> 3:01:51.440]  I made a difference in somebody's life today?
[3:01:51.440 --> 3:01:53.040]  I mean, you can go home every day.
[3:01:53.040 --> 3:01:53.880]  I can go home every day.
[3:01:53.880 --> 3:01:55.480]  And I can get money to fund our operation
[3:01:55.480 --> 3:01:57.200]  to fight for the Second Amendment,
[3:01:57.200 --> 3:01:59.680]  for family rights, for medical rights,
[3:01:59.680 --> 3:02:01.960]  for sovereignty, for our military
[3:02:01.960 --> 3:02:03.880]  to not be put on death list.
[3:02:03.880 --> 3:02:06.320]  I mean, I can't believe anybody actually attacks us.
[3:02:06.320 --> 3:02:07.640]  I mean, if you really look at what we do,
[3:02:07.640 --> 3:02:09.720]  it's so honest and real.
[3:02:09.720 --> 3:02:10.560]  It is.
[3:02:10.560 --> 3:02:13.320]  Like, don't put troops on secret death list.
[3:02:13.320 --> 3:02:16.720]  You know, don't have the government ship grabs in.
[3:02:16.720 --> 3:02:18.800]  You know, give people choice about their doctors.
[3:02:18.800 --> 3:02:23.800]  I mean, if I do anything wrong, even by accident, I'm guilty.
[3:02:25.240 --> 3:02:26.720]  But when I'm doing good, I feel so confident.
[3:02:26.720 --> 3:02:29.800]  I don't want to do anything wrong.
[3:02:29.800 --> 3:02:31.240]  That's why I don't get about these evil people.
[3:02:31.240 --> 3:02:33.280]  They don't have any conscience, Dr. Grip.
[3:02:33.280 --> 3:02:34.120]  No, they don't.
[3:02:34.120 --> 3:02:35.520]  I really feel sorry for them.
[3:02:35.520 --> 3:02:38.240]  You know, it'll come back and get them sooner or later.
[3:02:38.240 --> 3:02:41.440]  It's karma if you do good for people.
[3:02:41.440 --> 3:02:42.720]  And that's, and you believe,
[3:02:42.720 --> 3:02:46.000]  and your mission in life is to help change the world,
[3:02:46.000 --> 3:02:47.640]  help people on a daily basis.
[3:02:47.640 --> 3:02:48.480]  You will change the world.
[3:02:48.480 --> 3:02:49.800]  If you do that, you will.
[3:02:49.800 --> 3:02:53.400]  I mean, it's, I wish we could just read the stacks
[3:02:53.400 --> 3:02:55.560]  of people writing in.
[3:02:55.560 --> 3:02:57.920]  I was just talking to your customer service department.
[3:02:57.920 --> 3:02:59.520]  Why don't you go do a video on it with Anthony?
[3:02:59.520 --> 3:03:01.960]  And they, they're amazed.
[3:03:01.960 --> 3:03:04.120]  They sit there all day long and talk to people
[3:03:04.120 --> 3:03:05.240]  and they, and the people say,
[3:03:05.240 --> 3:03:09.240]  how this has changed their life, changed relationships,
[3:03:09.240 --> 3:03:11.960]  changed the way they feel, changed the way they think.
[3:03:11.960 --> 3:03:14.680]  My dad, my dad took oxy powder, finally did it.
[3:03:14.680 --> 3:03:16.240]  And he said, my God, I feel 10 years younger.
[3:03:16.240 --> 3:03:17.640]  He looks 10 years younger.
[3:03:17.640 --> 3:03:18.480]  I didn't have the same effect.
[3:03:18.480 --> 3:03:19.560]  I mean, I look a little bit better,
[3:03:19.560 --> 3:03:20.400]  but I'm still burnout.
[3:03:20.400 --> 3:03:22.480]  It's under stress, my issue stress.
[3:03:22.480 --> 3:03:24.400]  Well, stress, you know, stress is one of the things
[3:03:24.400 --> 3:03:26.960]  that people, I wish we could have a product.
[3:03:26.960 --> 3:03:29.880]  Dr. Griff, Dr. Griff, I've got to go deal with the meeting,
[3:03:29.880 --> 3:03:32.120]  but I'm going to let you come in and do a segment hosting
[3:03:32.120 --> 3:03:33.640]  straight ahead in overdrive.
[3:03:33.640 --> 3:03:35.320]  Dr. Evergrip, you're going to get to talk.
[3:03:35.320 --> 3:03:37.920]  Don't worry, because I'm going to be gone.
[3:03:37.920 --> 3:03:40.240]  If the IRS has garnished your paycheck
[3:03:40.240 --> 3:03:42.280]  or seized money from your bank account,
[3:03:42.280 --> 3:03:44.960]  you need to get professional tax help now.

[3:03:46.880 --> 3:03:49.240]  to these aggressive IRS collection tactics.

[3:04:35.600 --> 3:04:37.560]  not a solicitation for legal services.
[3:04:37.560 --> 3:04:40.960]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day.
[3:04:40.960 --> 3:04:44.440]  Big, heart-shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[3:04:44.440 --> 3:04:46.920]  What if we, the Patriots, hijacked Valentine's Day
[3:04:46.920 --> 3:04:49.080]  and instead made it about human liberty
[3:04:49.080 --> 3:04:50.520]  and individual empowerment?
[3:04:50.520 --> 3:04:51.880]  I'm all about human potential.
[3:04:51.880 --> 3:04:54.120]  I'm all about the individual being empowered.
[3:04:54.120 --> 3:04:55.720]  The establishment is the opposite.
[3:04:55.720 --> 3:04:58.480]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride and GMO,
[3:04:58.480 --> 3:05:00.360]  estrogen mimickers and the rest of the garbage.

[3:05:37.760 --> 3:05:40.160]  Hi, this is Steve Spillum for Midas Resources.
[3:05:40.160 --> 3:05:42.800]  In 1971, President Nixon took the United States
[3:05:42.800 --> 3:05:45.280]  off the gold standard and put us into a fiat currency.
[3:05:45.280 --> 3:05:47.000]  This allowed Congress and the Federal Reserve
[3:05:47.000 --> 3:05:49.200]  to create trillions of dollars out of thin air.
[3:05:49.200 --> 3:05:51.360]  The national debt has risen to incredible heights
[3:05:51.360 --> 3:05:53.600]  in your hard earned dollars by a small fraction
[3:05:53.600 --> 3:05:56.160]  of what they once did, the average life expectancy
[3:05:56.160 --> 3:05:58.240]  for a fiat currency is 27 years.
[3:05:58.240 --> 3:06:00.520]  The dollar is failing and on borrowed time.
[3:06:00.520 --> 3:06:02.720]  When currencies fall, people turn to gold and silver
[3:06:02.720 --> 3:06:04.600]  because gold and silver have been real money
[3:06:04.600 --> 3:06:06.280]  for more than 5,000 years.
[3:06:06.280 --> 3:06:08.200]  It is our mission and Midas Resources
[3:06:08.200 --> 3:06:09.800]  to help you preserve your capital.

[3:06:39.120 --> 3:06:41.800]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[3:06:41.800 --> 3:06:48.800]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:06:59.160 --> 3:07:01.520]  All right, so I'm here with Anthony Gucciardi
[3:07:01.520 --> 3:07:04.400]  and we're going to be talking about some of the victories
[3:07:04.400 --> 3:07:07.960]  and also some of the unknown chemicals and toxins
[3:07:07.960 --> 3:07:11.760]  that are found in people's homes that, you know,
[3:07:11.760 --> 3:07:13.480]  it's funny because it makes me think back.
[3:07:13.480 --> 3:07:16.840]  I mean, we were doing a little kind of a reality show
[3:07:16.840 --> 3:07:20.000]  a couple years ago and we were going in people's homes
[3:07:20.000 --> 3:07:23.360]  and I was challenged because there was some people that said,
[3:07:23.360 --> 3:07:25.680]  well, you know, this cleansing that you're talking about
[3:07:25.680 --> 3:07:28.000]  doing doesn't really hurt and, you know,
[3:07:28.000 --> 3:07:29.720]  it doesn't really help anyway.
[3:07:29.720 --> 3:07:32.360]  And so we found two or three people,
[3:07:32.360 --> 3:07:35.960]  I had a producer that found two or three people out there
[3:07:35.960 --> 3:07:38.320]  in homes that were extremely ill.
[3:07:38.320 --> 3:07:42.040]  And what we were going to do was surprise them in the morning
[3:07:42.040 --> 3:07:45.320]  with a film crew and I was going to go do a history
[3:07:45.320 --> 3:07:48.640]  on those individuals the proper way instead of spending
[3:07:48.640 --> 3:07:51.520]  seven minutes in a normal physician's office,
[3:07:51.520 --> 3:07:54.720]  like most people go in and then leave with a prescription.
[3:07:54.720 --> 3:07:57.320]  We were going to go in and actually identify everything
[3:07:57.320 --> 3:08:02.640]  because everybody's home and environment and diet is different.
[3:08:02.640 --> 3:08:06.000]  That's why you can't just give one person
[3:08:06.000 --> 3:08:08.000]  a prescription medication.
[3:08:08.000 --> 3:08:09.800]  You don't know how they're going to react to that.
[3:08:09.800 --> 3:08:12.240]  And then on top of that, two prescription medications,
[3:08:12.240 --> 3:08:13.560]  three prescription medications.
[3:08:13.560 --> 3:08:16.520]  What if they're using aluminum deodorant
[3:08:16.520 --> 3:08:20.200]  or what if they're using some sort of toxic substances
[3:08:20.200 --> 3:08:21.760]  on their skin, how is that going to react
[3:08:21.760 --> 3:08:23.280]  with the pharmaceutical?
[3:08:23.280 --> 3:08:25.120]  So it was interesting because we went in
[3:08:25.120 --> 3:08:29.280]  and I would evaluate these individuals, first of all,
[3:08:29.280 --> 3:08:30.600]  and then show up the next morning
[3:08:30.600 --> 3:08:32.000]  and tell them not to change anything.
[3:08:32.000 --> 3:08:35.280]  And sometimes we found mold in their house.
[3:08:35.280 --> 3:08:39.320]  They were sleeping with their laptop on their bed,
[3:08:39.320 --> 3:08:41.400]  on their body, plugged in,
[3:08:41.400 --> 3:08:43.560]  so they were exposed to electromagnetic radiation
[3:08:43.560 --> 3:08:46.960]  all night, went through their kitchen cabinets.
[3:08:46.960 --> 3:08:51.960]  All we found was toxic salt, high fructose corn syrup,
[3:08:51.960 --> 3:08:54.520]  nothing was organic in their kitchens.
[3:08:54.520 --> 3:08:58.680]  We found toxin after toxin after toxin.
[3:08:58.680 --> 3:09:03.280]  And part of my initial research was to determine
[3:09:03.280 --> 3:09:07.320]  the root cause of all disease.
[3:09:07.320 --> 3:09:09.640]  And the root cause of all disease
[3:09:09.640 --> 3:09:11.960]  is too many toxins coming in the body
[3:09:11.960 --> 3:09:13.520]  and not enough toxins coming out
[3:09:13.520 --> 3:09:18.040]  because we've become more of a sedentary society
[3:09:18.040 --> 3:09:19.280]  sitting down all the time.
[3:09:19.280 --> 3:09:22.440]  So one of the things that I used to do
[3:09:22.440 --> 3:09:24.400]  is when we had our cancer clinic,
[3:09:24.400 --> 3:09:26.280]  before we got shut down actually,
[3:09:26.280 --> 3:09:29.000]  is start cleansing people out and cleansing people out
[3:09:29.000 --> 3:09:32.680]  and avoiding all of the toxins that they're exposed to
[3:09:32.680 --> 3:09:36.080]  in their environment on a daily basis.
[3:09:36.080 --> 3:09:40.880]  And it worked so good that we weren't able to address
[3:09:40.880 --> 3:09:44.520]  and say, we have a cure for cancer or anything like that.
[3:09:44.520 --> 3:09:47.480]  But don't you think that, I mean,
[3:09:47.480 --> 3:09:50.640]  I've realized over the years that everything is in simplicity
[3:09:50.640 --> 3:09:53.680]  because I used to have 250 different types
[3:09:53.680 --> 3:09:56.280]  of nutritional supplements in our cabinet
[3:09:56.280 --> 3:09:57.120]  that we could use.
[3:09:57.120 --> 3:09:58.040]  And we've used everything.
[3:09:58.040 --> 3:10:00.400]  I trained with the cancer doctors down in Mexico
[3:10:00.400 --> 3:10:02.120]  and Germany and all over the world
[3:10:02.120 --> 3:10:04.840]  and we'd have all these elaborate programs.
[3:10:04.840 --> 3:10:08.200]  But one thing that we did when we were treating individuals
[3:10:08.200 --> 3:10:11.600]  was that every single person was its own person.
[3:10:11.600 --> 3:10:14.960]  I mean, we looked at each individual.
[3:10:14.960 --> 3:10:16.760]  And I think that talking about
[3:10:16.760 --> 3:10:18.440]  all these endocrine disrupting chemicals,
[3:10:18.440 --> 3:10:20.920]  talking about how we can change the world
[3:10:20.920 --> 3:10:25.080]  is that people need to take a look at themselves
[3:10:25.080 --> 3:10:27.760]  and realize what are they doing?
[3:10:27.760 --> 3:10:32.400]  What are they exposing themselves to every single day?
[3:10:32.400 --> 3:10:33.920]  What is the stress levels?
[3:10:33.920 --> 3:10:35.920]  How much sleep are they getting?
[3:10:35.920 --> 3:10:39.600]  And really the simple part about becoming healthy
[3:10:39.600 --> 3:10:43.960]  and becoming aware is becoming aware of what you're doing
[3:10:43.960 --> 3:10:46.000]  and what you're putting in your body on a daily basis.
[3:10:46.000 --> 3:10:47.520]  How do you feel about that?
[3:10:47.520 --> 3:10:49.840]  You know, I think we've had so many victories
[3:10:49.840 --> 3:10:53.880]  just speaking on BPA or high fructose corn syrup or GMOs.
[3:10:53.880 --> 3:10:55.200]  I mean, a poll came out yesterday
[3:10:55.200 --> 3:10:57.880]  and I just read it earlier that GMOs
[3:10:57.880 --> 3:11:00.440]  are now one of the most hot topic issues
[3:11:00.440 --> 3:11:02.520]  in the United States according to a major poll.
[3:11:02.520 --> 3:11:03.840]  And I think it was Gallup.
[3:11:03.840 --> 3:11:06.080]  So what that shows me and what it shows me
[3:11:06.080 --> 3:11:08.080]  when major food producers are just completely
[3:11:08.080 --> 3:11:10.040]  cutting out high fructose corn syrup
[3:11:10.040 --> 3:11:12.440]  is that we are actually achieving victories
[3:11:12.440 --> 3:11:14.440]  and defeating the food corporations
[3:11:14.440 --> 3:11:16.400]  only by the mere fact that they know
[3:11:16.400 --> 3:11:19.640]  we will not buy their crap unless they change it.
[3:11:19.640 --> 3:11:22.080]  And it also reminds me, however,
[3:11:22.080 --> 3:11:23.840]  that we have to stay vigilant in this effort
[3:11:23.840 --> 3:11:25.200]  and continue to maintain our health.
[3:11:25.200 --> 3:11:28.040]  Because let's say, as you saw multiple times
[3:11:28.040 --> 3:11:30.520]  in earlier when we did a video about the contaminants
[3:11:30.520 --> 3:11:32.760]  and food that you talked about in air as well,
[3:11:32.760 --> 3:11:35.360]  an average individual that is eating organic
[3:11:35.360 --> 3:11:37.520]  and maintaining a healthy lifestyle,
[3:11:37.520 --> 3:11:40.160]  they're still missing little loopholes in this system.
[3:11:40.160 --> 3:11:43.760]  So for example, you could be having a BPA free water bottle.
[3:11:43.760 --> 3:11:45.680]  What is it, BPS free?
[3:11:45.680 --> 3:11:47.880]  Well, you say, what is BPS?
[3:11:47.880 --> 3:11:49.480]  Bisphenol S.
[3:11:49.480 --> 3:11:52.280]  And you say, well, I thought there was just bisphenol A.
[3:11:52.280 --> 3:11:53.960]  And if you pull up the Wikipedia page,
[3:11:53.960 --> 3:11:57.040]  which I think we have back there for BPA, bisphenol A,
[3:11:57.040 --> 3:11:59.080]  it's extremely extensive.
[3:11:59.080 --> 3:12:03.320]  It's just breast cancer, prostate cancer,
[3:12:03.320 --> 3:12:04.640]  induced narcolepsy.
[3:12:04.640 --> 3:12:06.440]  Just every possible thing in the world
[3:12:06.440 --> 3:12:09.080]  is up on that Wikipedia page from all the research, right?
[3:12:09.080 --> 3:12:10.680]  Because there's hundreds and hundreds of studies
[3:12:10.680 --> 3:12:13.800]  despite Susan G. Komen teaming up with KFC
[3:12:13.800 --> 3:12:15.680]  and making pink buckets for the cure
[3:12:15.680 --> 3:12:17.920]  and denying that BPA has any association.
[3:12:17.920 --> 3:12:21.560]  But then you look at the BPS, bisphenol S page,
[3:12:21.560 --> 3:12:22.720]  and how much is there?
[3:12:22.720 --> 3:12:25.800]  There's enough to scroll for 0.01 seconds.
[3:12:25.800 --> 3:12:27.280]  I mean, there's almost nothing in there.
[3:12:27.280 --> 3:12:30.280]  So what happened is they went ahead,
[3:12:30.280 --> 3:12:32.640]  and if you actually read the description,
[3:12:32.640 --> 3:12:34.520]  BPA is extremely blah, blah, blah.
[3:12:34.520 --> 3:12:36.880]  If you read bisphenol S, it just says
[3:12:36.880 --> 3:12:39.080]  it's basically the same thing as BPA,
[3:12:39.080 --> 3:12:40.720]  but it has a different name.
[3:12:40.720 --> 3:12:41.560]  So what is that?
[3:12:41.560 --> 3:12:45.480]  That's a corporate manifestation of screwing us over.
[3:12:45.480 --> 3:12:48.400]  It's calling BPA, BPS, and it is a little different.
[3:12:48.400 --> 3:12:51.400]  And they put it in the plastics, and they say it's BPA free,
[3:12:51.400 --> 3:12:52.800]  but it has BPS in it.
[3:12:52.800 --> 3:12:54.320]  So thankfully now when I go to Whole Foods,
[3:12:54.320 --> 3:12:56.480]  it says BPA and BPS free,
[3:12:56.480 --> 3:12:57.920]  because people are waking up about it.
[3:12:57.920 --> 3:13:00.120]  But that's just one of the ways that they'll continue
[3:13:00.120 --> 3:13:01.880]  to attack us over and over and over again,
[3:13:01.880 --> 3:13:03.360]  even when we achieve these victories,
[3:13:03.360 --> 3:13:05.440]  because the food corporations are constantly thinking
[3:13:05.440 --> 3:13:08.520]  of new ways to trick us into eating their poison crap,
[3:13:08.520 --> 3:13:10.840]  because they don't want to spend one penny more.
[3:13:10.840 --> 3:13:12.320]  And it brings me back to McDonald's too.
[3:13:12.320 --> 3:13:15.320]  So McDonald's, obviously, their CEO got fired
[3:13:15.320 --> 3:13:17.760]  because their revenues are just not making the cut.
[3:13:17.760 --> 3:13:18.920]  They're underperforming the market.
[3:13:18.920 --> 3:13:19.960]  They're not growing.
[3:13:19.960 --> 3:13:21.800]  Some people say, some top economists say,
[3:13:21.800 --> 3:13:23.120]  they actually could go bankrupt
[3:13:23.120 --> 3:13:24.520]  within the next five to 10 years.
[3:13:24.520 --> 3:13:25.680]  Well, why is that?
[3:13:25.680 --> 3:13:28.920]  It's not just that their food is garbage and full of GMOs.
[3:13:28.920 --> 3:13:31.160]  It's not just that it doesn't even taste good,
[3:13:31.160 --> 3:13:33.440]  and even people who are low income
[3:13:33.440 --> 3:13:35.440]  can go to Whole Foods and buy a salad for $4.
[3:13:35.440 --> 3:13:36.720]  It's not just that.
[3:13:36.720 --> 3:13:40.440]  It's that they are so obtrusively evil in the sense
[3:13:40.440 --> 3:13:43.240]  that they refuse to spend two pennies more
[3:13:43.240 --> 3:13:45.360]  to remove the crap from their food.
[3:13:45.360 --> 3:13:47.560]  So I mean, honestly, they make so much money.
[3:13:47.560 --> 3:13:50.160]  They could really just source non-GMO stuff
[3:13:50.160 --> 3:13:51.680]  and do a huge public campaign.
[3:13:51.680 --> 3:13:52.600]  We're non-GMO now.
[3:13:52.600 --> 3:13:54.480]  Do you know how many people would go to McDonald's?
[3:13:54.480 --> 3:13:55.920]  Chipotle makes money off of that,
[3:13:55.920 --> 3:13:57.600]  saying we're going to start labeling GMOs.
[3:13:57.600 --> 3:14:00.520]  Even like, didn't McDonald's buy Chipotle or something?
[3:14:00.520 --> 3:14:02.680]  And then they sold it back because they wanted to come in
[3:14:02.680 --> 3:14:04.000]  and use all their own ingredients.
[3:14:04.000 --> 3:14:07.560]  And Chipotle was using and sourcing organic products in.
[3:14:07.560 --> 3:14:09.640]  It was their last hope to be relevant again.
[3:14:09.640 --> 3:14:11.920]  Well, look how long it took for the organic,
[3:14:11.920 --> 3:14:13.560]  first of all, Whole Foods comes out.
[3:14:13.560 --> 3:14:15.680]  And now you're finding organic sections
[3:14:15.680 --> 3:14:18.200]  in practically every single supermarket out there,
[3:14:18.200 --> 3:14:22.160]  which is great because it's the demand of the people.
[3:14:22.160 --> 3:14:23.680]  It's like, if we want to make a change,
[3:14:23.680 --> 3:14:25.920]  then we need to, actually a good idea would be
[3:14:25.920 --> 3:14:28.480]  for somebody to develop some sort of a can
[3:14:28.480 --> 3:14:31.280]  that's not made of aluminum in line with BPA.
[3:14:33.080 --> 3:14:35.360]  If we stop buying the chemicals
[3:14:35.360 --> 3:14:39.600]  and if we stop buying chemical lotions
[3:14:39.600 --> 3:14:41.680]  and household products and cleaners,
[3:14:41.680 --> 3:14:44.640]  and if we use natural herbicides and pesticides,
[3:14:44.640 --> 3:14:47.120]  I mean, it's not hard, you can do it yourself stuff.
[3:14:47.120 --> 3:14:50.200]  You can go on Google and type in natural cleaner
[3:14:50.200 --> 3:14:52.920]  and mix vinegar and water and a little lemon juice,
[3:14:52.920 --> 3:14:55.960]  maybe some orange peel, soak some orange peel in there.
[3:14:55.960 --> 3:14:58.320]  I mean, it's very inexpensive.
[3:14:58.320 --> 3:14:59.160]  You're not polluting.
[3:14:59.160 --> 3:15:00.800]  A coconut oil is a makeup remover, by the way.
[3:15:00.800 --> 3:15:03.240]  All the women out there listening use coconut oil.
[3:15:03.240 --> 3:15:06.000]  It costs like $4 instead of the makeup removers
[3:15:06.000 --> 3:15:07.120]  and the alcohols that you use,
[3:15:07.120 --> 3:15:08.880]  and it saves your face instantly.
[3:15:08.880 --> 3:15:10.960]  But you know, what I think it boils down to,
[3:15:10.960 --> 3:15:12.800]  and you could ask any of the economists about this,
[3:15:12.800 --> 3:15:15.320]  the market doesn't actually reflect what the people want
[3:15:15.320 --> 3:15:16.600]  for a very long time.
[3:15:16.600 --> 3:15:19.200]  So I think now we're seeing Whole Foods explode
[3:15:19.200 --> 3:15:21.200]  and non-GMO is the number one thing.
[3:15:21.200 --> 3:15:23.320]  Now it's the number one trend in the industries
[3:15:23.320 --> 3:15:25.400]  because people are actually getting options.
[3:15:25.400 --> 3:15:26.400]  I mean, I still go to the store
[3:15:26.400 --> 3:15:27.640]  and I try to find organic things,
[3:15:27.640 --> 3:15:29.040]  like I can't find organic squash
[3:15:29.040 --> 3:15:31.600]  or organic beets these days for some reason,
[3:15:31.600 --> 3:15:33.280]  but I go out and I can't find that.
[3:15:33.280 --> 3:15:36.000]  As soon as that is available, it's going to skyrocket.
[3:15:36.000 --> 3:15:37.320]  But these options aren't available yet
[3:15:37.320 --> 3:15:39.720]  because the market is lagging behind reality.
[3:15:39.720 --> 3:15:42.800]  So we're pushing it forward in an ultra-dynamic system
[3:15:42.800 --> 3:15:45.800]  and their old sluggish, multi-generations old
[3:15:45.800 --> 3:15:48.600]  like McDonald's system is just trying to pull us back in
[3:15:48.600 --> 3:15:49.920]  and act like they're trendy and cool
[3:15:49.920 --> 3:15:50.840]  with their Super Bowl ads.
[3:15:50.840 --> 3:15:52.800]  Like, hey, we're healthy, we have salads.
[3:15:52.800 --> 3:15:54.760]  It also contains a yoga mat chemical
[3:15:54.760 --> 3:15:56.400]  that's banned in most countries.
[3:15:56.400 --> 3:15:58.440]  So, you know, it's a total ploy system
[3:15:58.440 --> 3:16:01.360]  to get you back roped into this archaic aging system.
[3:16:01.360 --> 3:16:02.200]  And that's how we have to think about it.
[3:16:02.200 --> 3:16:04.680]  It's a ratty, molding cave
[3:16:04.680 --> 3:16:06.560]  that we're just being pulled back into
[3:16:06.560 --> 3:16:08.360]  because the number one way they're going to get us
[3:16:08.360 --> 3:16:10.120]  is not by actually changing their ingredients.
[3:16:10.120 --> 3:16:11.520]  And that's the only way to survive now
[3:16:11.520 --> 3:16:13.800]  is by using marketing ploys to make us think
[3:16:13.800 --> 3:16:15.440]  that what we're doing is eating healthy.
[3:16:15.440 --> 3:16:16.760]  Like when you eat a salad at McDonald's,
[3:16:16.760 --> 3:16:18.320]  you might as well just eat the Big Mac.
[3:16:18.320 --> 3:16:19.800]  Or when you're eating, drinking diet soda,
[3:16:19.800 --> 3:16:21.880]  it'd be better for you to just drink regular soda.
[3:16:21.880 --> 3:16:23.760]  Yeah, you know what the sad thing is that
[3:16:23.760 --> 3:16:26.240]  it's sad to see people that are just suffering
[3:16:26.240 --> 3:16:28.320]  year after year after year.
[3:16:28.320 --> 3:16:31.320]  And what I was telling you about that show we did,
[3:16:31.320 --> 3:16:32.440]  the amazing thing is,
[3:16:32.440 --> 3:16:34.720]  is we wanted to try to transform that person's life
[3:16:34.720 --> 3:16:35.880]  in 90 days.
[3:16:35.880 --> 3:16:38.720]  One of the individuals we were going into their house
[3:16:38.720 --> 3:16:40.480]  had been suffering with severe asthma.
[3:16:40.480 --> 3:16:43.080]  I mean, she had a symptom list of probably 50 things
[3:16:43.080 --> 3:16:44.240]  she was suffering from.
[3:16:45.400 --> 3:16:47.800]  So what we did was we came in,
[3:16:47.800 --> 3:16:50.200]  we completely replaced everything in her house
[3:16:50.200 --> 3:16:52.080]  with natural alternatives.
[3:16:52.080 --> 3:16:54.680]  All of her foods was, we switched to organic.
[3:16:54.680 --> 3:16:56.040]  And then we did one thing.
[3:16:56.040 --> 3:16:58.160]  And we started her out with an intestinal cleanse,
[3:16:58.160 --> 3:17:01.400]  get, then we moved on to liver and gallbladder cleansing.
[3:17:01.400 --> 3:17:04.040]  And talking about liver and gallbladder cleansing,
[3:17:04.040 --> 3:17:06.680]  you know, all these supplements at the InfoWars life,
[3:17:06.680 --> 3:17:09.640]  I mean, everything is designed to
[3:17:09.640 --> 3:17:12.880]  help cleanse your system, help boost your system,
[3:17:12.880 --> 3:17:14.680]  help balance your system.
[3:17:14.680 --> 3:17:16.920]  So some of these symptoms can go away.
[3:17:16.920 --> 3:17:21.080]  And when we cleaned her up, within 90 days,
[3:17:21.080 --> 3:17:23.160]  the majority of her symptoms were gone
[3:17:23.160 --> 3:17:24.720]  and she was living her life again.
[3:17:24.720 --> 3:17:27.120]  Now, can you imagine the millions and millions
[3:17:27.120 --> 3:17:29.120]  and millions of people out there that can benefit
[3:17:29.120 --> 3:17:31.920]  from something so simple as cleansing the body?
[3:17:31.920 --> 3:17:35.640]  That's why you look at all of the ancient texts out there,
[3:17:35.640 --> 3:17:39.280]  you know, all of the religious texts.
[3:17:39.280 --> 3:17:41.280]  I mean, anything, the ancient Egyptian texts,
[3:17:41.280 --> 3:17:43.200]  and they all talk about the importance
[3:17:43.200 --> 3:17:45.840]  of cleansing the body or at least fasting for one day
[3:17:45.840 --> 3:17:49.560]  or doing something to cleanse your system.
[3:17:49.560 --> 3:17:52.920]  And how many toxins were around back then?
[3:17:52.920 --> 3:17:55.600]  There weren't even any chemicals back then.
[3:17:55.600 --> 3:17:58.200]  And now there's millions upon millions of chemicals
[3:17:58.200 --> 3:17:59.920]  that are disrupting your brain function,
[3:17:59.920 --> 3:18:01.920]  disrupting your organ function,
[3:18:01.920 --> 3:18:03.840]  all your endocrine disrupting chemicals.
[3:18:03.840 --> 3:18:06.000]  And you know, I keep harping on endocrine
[3:18:06.000 --> 3:18:10.080]  because what's happening is this is a design
[3:18:10.080 --> 3:18:13.280]  for future generations because what they're seeing now
[3:18:13.280 --> 3:18:16.480]  is you manipulate the genes in the fetus
[3:18:16.480 --> 3:18:20.400]  and then for four generations, you can have problems.
[3:18:20.400 --> 3:18:23.560]  So they're setting the stage for four generations
[3:18:23.560 --> 3:18:24.400]  in the future being on the stage.
[3:18:24.400 --> 3:18:26.240]  And we're gonna talk about the ways to avoid those
[3:18:26.240 --> 3:18:28.560]  coming up after this break and we're gonna continue on
[3:18:28.560 --> 3:18:30.560]  throughout 30 minutes of the session.
[3:18:30.560 --> 3:18:59.560]  It's no secret that government and big business buy and bulk
[3:18:59.560 --> 3:19:08.080]  of the business.
[3:19:08.080 --> 3:19:09.120]  We, the people grow cotton, weave fabric,
[3:19:09.120 --> 3:19:11.680]  engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit
[3:19:11.680 --> 3:19:14.720]  and carting to a private bank having it led back at interest,
[3:19:14.720 --> 3:19:16.240]  forcing taxes to serve us debt.
[3:19:16.240 --> 3:19:17.920]  This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct
[3:19:17.920 --> 3:19:20.320]  when stating a central bank issuing to public currency
[3:19:20.320 --> 3:19:22.120]  is a greater menace to the liberties of the people
[3:19:22.120 --> 3:19:23.120]  than a standing army?
[3:19:23.120 --> 3:19:25.080]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book
[3:19:25.080 --> 3:19:26.840]  that explains our monetary system.
[3:19:26.840 --> 3:19:30.160]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[3:19:30.160 --> 3:19:31.520]  It's time to understand the system.
[3:19:31.520 --> 3:19:33.880]  Call 800-686-2237.
[3:19:33.880 --> 3:19:36.440]  That's 800-686-2237.
[3:19:36.440 --> 3:19:37.640]  The experts are clear.
[3:19:37.640 --> 3:19:41.280]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food,
[3:19:41.280 --> 3:19:43.500]  and having a good attitude is essential
[3:19:43.500 --> 3:19:44.880]  to a healthy immune system.
[3:19:44.880 --> 3:19:48.280]  But I go further with Super nascent iodine X2
[3:19:48.280 --> 3:19:50.360]  from infowarslife.com.
[3:19:50.360 --> 3:19:52.600]  50% stronger than our original
[3:19:52.600 --> 3:19:54.840]  and revolutionary nascent iodine formula.
[3:19:54.840 --> 3:19:57.320]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source
[3:19:57.320 --> 3:19:59.040]  that no other supplier has.
[3:19:59.040 --> 3:20:01.600]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed
[3:20:01.600 --> 3:20:04.360]  in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[3:20:04.360 --> 3:20:05.360]  Not our iodine.
[3:20:05.360 --> 3:20:07.520]  It comes from over 200 million year old
[3:20:07.520 --> 3:20:09.160]  crystal salt deposits
[3:20:09.160 --> 3:20:11.720]  and is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[3:20:42.400 --> 3:20:44.560]  And in a word, the answer is protection.
[3:20:44.560 --> 3:20:46.200]  Protection from water main breaks,
[3:20:46.200 --> 3:20:49.400]  E. coli contamination, environmental chemical spills,
[3:20:49.400 --> 3:20:52.240]  pesticide runoff, chlorine taste and smell,
[3:20:52.240 --> 3:20:53.880]  and all forms of fluoride.

[3:21:03.640 --> 3:21:06.200]  they are the gold standard in water purification.
[3:21:06.200 --> 3:21:08.040]  At only 1.7 cents a gallon,

[3:21:36.960 --> 3:21:38.360]  This alert just came in.
[3:21:38.360 --> 3:21:40.880]  This special announcement is for business owners
[3:21:40.880 --> 3:21:42.720]  and leaders of organizations
[3:21:42.720 --> 3:21:45.920]  who've been waiting for the right time to build.
[3:21:45.920 --> 3:21:47.880]  General Steel has made it impossible
[3:21:47.880 --> 3:21:49.960]  to wait any longer with rock bottom prices
[3:21:49.960 --> 3:21:51.840]  that could save you thousands.
[3:21:51.840 --> 3:21:53.160]  That's right, General Steel,
[3:21:53.160 --> 3:21:55.840]  America's leader in pre-engineered structures,
[3:21:55.840 --> 3:21:58.960]  is offering buildings at prices you will never see again.
[3:21:58.960 --> 3:22:00.240]  Don't miss these prices.
[3:22:00.240 --> 3:22:03.040]  A 50 by 100 for $35,000.
[3:22:03.040 --> 3:22:06.480]  You heard right, that's 5,000 square feet for $35,000.
[3:22:06.480 --> 3:22:08.480]  Manufacturers, if you need a larger building,
[3:22:08.480 --> 3:22:12.400]  try a 100 by 100 commercial building for 129,000.
[3:22:12.400 --> 3:22:14.400]  You can't afford to rent with these prices.
[3:22:14.400 --> 3:22:16.680]  Imagine a 70 by 100 foot church building
[3:22:16.680 --> 3:22:18.560]  for under $69,000.
[3:22:18.560 --> 3:22:20.880]  With the economy improving and interest rates
[3:22:20.880 --> 3:22:23.680]  still at historic lows, you can't afford to wait.
[3:22:23.680 --> 3:22:26.680]  So call 866-91-Steel.

[3:22:43.440 --> 3:22:46.440]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:22:46.440 --> 3:22:50.640]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[3:22:50.640 --> 3:22:52.880]  Hi, I'm Dr. Group, filling in for Alex Jones.
[3:22:52.880 --> 3:22:55.880]  In this last segment, I'm talking with Anthony Gucciardi,
[3:22:55.880 --> 3:22:58.160]  and we've kind of been going over some of the toxins
[3:22:58.160 --> 3:23:02.040]  that you find in your home and some of the natural ways
[3:23:02.040 --> 3:23:03.600]  that you can eliminate these toxins
[3:23:03.600 --> 3:23:05.560]  and actually keep your body clean.
[3:23:05.560 --> 3:23:08.440]  And I was talking about the importance of cleansing, Anthony.
[3:23:08.440 --> 3:23:12.760]  It's amazing that you can get such good results
[3:23:12.760 --> 3:23:15.280]  with something so simple, you know?
[3:23:15.280 --> 3:23:16.760]  You look at the medical profession,
[3:23:16.760 --> 3:23:19.800]  there's all this documented research behind this,
[3:23:19.800 --> 3:23:22.000]  and most of it's paid by the pharmaceutical companies.
[3:23:22.000 --> 3:23:25.960]  I mean, really, if you look at clinical trials,
[3:23:25.960 --> 3:23:28.440]  like what we were talking about before,
[3:23:28.440 --> 3:23:30.400]  every single person is different, right?
[3:23:30.400 --> 3:23:32.160]  Everybody has a different diet,
[3:23:32.160 --> 3:23:33.840]  a different environment when they live,
[3:23:33.840 --> 3:23:35.360]  a different stress levels.
[3:23:35.360 --> 3:23:38.000]  How is it possible, it's not possible,
[3:23:38.000 --> 3:23:41.480]  to do an accurate clinical trial on a group of people
[3:23:41.480 --> 3:23:43.360]  unless you put them in a cage
[3:23:43.360 --> 3:23:45.960]  and you feed them exactly the same thing every day,
[3:23:45.960 --> 3:23:48.560]  you expose them to the same stress levels every day,
[3:23:48.560 --> 3:23:51.160]  you expose them to the same air quality, water.
[3:23:51.160 --> 3:23:52.760]  I mean, all of those variables.
[3:23:52.760 --> 3:23:55.760]  So really, it's impossible to have
[3:23:55.760 --> 3:23:57.320]  an accurate clinical trial.
[3:23:57.320 --> 3:24:00.400]  And I'm always looking for the simplest things
[3:24:00.400 --> 3:24:01.840]  that people can do.
[3:24:01.840 --> 3:24:05.840]  And it really comes down to recognizing
[3:24:05.840 --> 3:24:07.520]  what you're putting in your body,
[3:24:07.520 --> 3:24:09.480]  what you're being exposed to,
[3:24:09.480 --> 3:24:12.280]  and getting rid of that and replacing those things
[3:24:12.280 --> 3:24:13.800]  with natural alternatives
[3:24:13.800 --> 3:24:15.880]  and cleansing your body on a regular basis.
[3:24:15.880 --> 3:24:17.880]  Well, here's something interesting.
[3:24:17.880 --> 3:24:21.280]  I mean, cocaine, marijuana, and heroin
[3:24:21.280 --> 3:24:24.520]  have more real trials than most pharmaceutical drugs.
[3:24:24.520 --> 3:24:26.480]  I mean, straight up, they have more testing
[3:24:26.480 --> 3:24:29.160]  over periods of decades than most pharmaceutical drugs.
[3:24:29.160 --> 3:24:30.960]  And you talk about that because they say,
[3:24:30.960 --> 3:24:32.960]  we take individuals, we give them the drug,
[3:24:32.960 --> 3:24:36.200]  they all are the same, doing nothing different
[3:24:36.200 --> 3:24:37.200]  besides taking this drug.
[3:24:37.200 --> 3:24:38.280]  Well, what do you do?
[3:24:38.280 --> 3:24:39.880]  Oh, they can eat whatever they want.
[3:24:39.880 --> 3:24:42.200]  They can resume their normal lifestyles,
[3:24:42.200 --> 3:24:43.560]  is what the study will say.
[3:24:43.560 --> 3:24:45.080]  What is their normal lifestyle?
[3:24:45.080 --> 3:24:47.880]  Someone might go home and eat organic bananas,
[3:24:47.880 --> 3:24:50.320]  and the other person might go out to Popeyes and McDonald's
[3:24:50.320 --> 3:24:51.640]  and eat that every single day.
[3:24:51.640 --> 3:24:52.720]  So what is normal?
[3:24:52.720 --> 3:24:54.600]  What is the real trial?
[3:24:54.600 --> 3:24:56.720]  There's no real information on that part.
[3:24:56.720 --> 3:24:59.200]  And then it brings me back to some of the studies
[3:24:59.200 --> 3:25:01.240]  where, let's say, BPA, for example,
[3:25:01.240 --> 3:25:03.680]  or GMOs or anything like that.
[3:25:03.680 --> 3:25:05.920]  It's always the two, there's always two studies.
[3:25:05.920 --> 3:25:08.480]  It's really funny because one is bad, right?
[3:25:08.480 --> 3:25:09.320]  It's not enough.
[3:25:09.320 --> 3:25:11.560]  But two studies are funded by the industry
[3:25:11.560 --> 3:25:13.480]  that wants to keep selling it, right?
[3:25:13.480 --> 3:25:15.480]  Like Monsanto or whatever.
[3:25:15.480 --> 3:25:17.520]  They'll fund two studies because they
[3:25:17.520 --> 3:25:19.960]  say in the scientific method, you need two studies,
[3:25:19.960 --> 3:25:22.480]  and there'll be 100 studies saying it's dangerous.
[3:25:22.480 --> 3:25:24.120]  But there's those two studies, and they'll
[3:25:24.120 --> 3:25:25.680]  cling to those two studies in the FDA,
[3:25:25.680 --> 3:25:28.120]  and they're ruling for BPA because they almost banned it.
[3:25:28.120 --> 3:25:30.120]  It was a $100 billion industry, though.
[3:25:30.120 --> 3:25:33.000]  There was numerous lobbyists who they just kept pushing it.
[3:25:33.000 --> 3:25:34.640]  There's two studies that say it's safe.
[3:25:34.640 --> 3:25:36.160]  There's these two studies.
[3:25:36.160 --> 3:25:36.960]  Who's it paid for?
[3:25:36.960 --> 3:25:39.280]  I'll pay it for by, of course, the BPA producer.
[3:25:39.280 --> 3:25:41.920]  There's over 100 studies that link it to breast cancer,
[3:25:41.920 --> 3:25:43.560]  but there's these two studies.
[3:25:43.560 --> 3:25:45.120]  And what does Monsanto say?
[3:25:45.120 --> 3:25:47.720]  There's two studies that we have that show
[3:25:47.720 --> 3:25:50.040]  that GMOs are perfectly safe, even though when we give it
[3:25:50.040 --> 3:25:51.640]  to rats, they all die and get tumors,
[3:25:51.640 --> 3:25:54.800]  or just literally farmers freaking out saying,
[3:25:54.800 --> 3:25:56.680]  I give my pigs GMOs and they die.
[3:25:56.680 --> 3:25:59.960]  So to me, what's more important than even these studies,
[3:25:59.960 --> 3:26:01.960]  and you can go to the National Library of Medicine
[3:26:01.960 --> 3:26:03.880]  and type in iodine and get hundreds of studies,
[3:26:03.880 --> 3:26:07.120]  or you can type in oregano oil, or you can type in vitamin D,
[3:26:07.120 --> 3:26:08.760]  which everyone knows is good for you,
[3:26:08.760 --> 3:26:11.280]  even though they say you're not allowed to have the sun anymore.
[3:26:11.280 --> 3:26:14.080]  But you can't actually get an accurate description
[3:26:14.080 --> 3:26:17.360]  of what something like a statin will do outside
[3:26:17.360 --> 3:26:20.920]  of the side effects for your actual beneficial health.
[3:26:20.920 --> 3:26:23.160]  That's why they have statistical lying,
[3:26:23.160 --> 3:26:25.520]  which was traded by the guy, by the way,
[3:26:25.520 --> 3:26:28.920]  who said that tobacco and cigarettes were perfectly safe,
[3:26:28.920 --> 3:26:31.960]  and he's also the same guy that said organic
[3:26:31.960 --> 3:26:34.640]  and non-organic are the exact same.
[3:26:34.640 --> 3:26:38.080]  The father of statistical lies, that's the actual name.
[3:26:38.080 --> 3:26:40.600]  And Graham Olken is the same, he works with Stanford.
[3:26:40.600 --> 3:26:44.360]  And they said that organic is the same as vegetable food.
[3:26:44.360 --> 3:26:48.240]  One thing that just amazes me is that people don't look
[3:26:48.240 --> 3:26:51.560]  at the labels, and especially with children.
[3:26:51.560 --> 3:26:55.440]  I just talked to some moms that are pretty much organic,
[3:26:55.440 --> 3:26:57.680]  and but they're hooked on CNN,
[3:26:57.680 --> 3:26:59.280]  and they watch the news all the time,
[3:26:59.280 --> 3:27:01.000]  and they're worried about the measles.
[3:27:01.000 --> 3:27:04.320]  They haven't given their kids the whole rounds of vaccinations
[3:27:04.320 --> 3:27:07.360]  because they do believe that vaccinations are bad.
[3:27:07.360 --> 3:27:09.920]  And all of a sudden, they're watching all this stuff
[3:27:09.920 --> 3:27:14.240]  about the MMR and how their kid could possibly die
[3:27:14.240 --> 3:27:16.800]  and all of the unvaccinated children,
[3:27:16.800 --> 3:27:18.360]  and they get scared and they run out
[3:27:18.360 --> 3:27:20.560]  and they give their kid the MMR vaccine.
[3:27:21.400 --> 3:27:25.120]  My question is, how long does it take
[3:27:25.120 --> 3:27:28.000]  to punch in the internet and say,
[3:27:28.000 --> 3:27:31.240]  what's in an MMR vaccine?
[3:27:31.240 --> 3:27:35.560]  I mean, if you look and just do a little bit of research
[3:27:35.560 --> 3:27:40.440]  and you see what's in it, I mean, that's a no brainer.
[3:27:40.440 --> 3:27:42.840]  I'm not gonna put, if I can't pronounce half the stuff
[3:27:42.840 --> 3:27:45.080]  in there like Triton X and Formaldehyde
[3:27:45.080 --> 3:27:46.920]  and everything else, I know, I mean,
[3:27:46.920 --> 3:27:49.600]  instinctively you should know that that's not good
[3:27:49.600 --> 3:27:50.720]  to inject into somebody.
[3:27:50.720 --> 3:27:53.280]  I wouldn't even be speaking out against vaccinations
[3:27:53.280 --> 3:27:54.600]  if they didn't contain those things.
[3:27:54.600 --> 3:27:56.680]  You know, obviously the people, the elite,
[3:27:56.680 --> 3:27:58.680]  the in the know individuals receive clean ones
[3:27:58.680 --> 3:28:00.640]  without hormones, antibiotics, everything like that.
[3:28:00.640 --> 3:28:03.040]  Well, I was amazed by all this.
[3:28:03.040 --> 3:28:05.720]  We got to pack into this short 30 minutes on the show here,
[3:28:05.720 --> 3:28:08.880]  but Alex will be back tomorrow from 11 to two, as usual.
[3:28:08.880 --> 3:28:11.400]  Thanks a lot, Dr. Group, for filling in for Alex.
[3:28:11.400 --> 3:28:12.480]  Thanks for everybody listening.
[3:28:12.480 --> 3:28:14.760]  Go through your house, look at what you have,
[3:28:14.760 --> 3:28:16.000]  start throwing everything else.
[3:28:16.000 --> 3:28:19.640]  If you don't know what it is, go online and search for it.
[3:28:26.640 --> 3:28:30.360]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[3:28:30.360 --> 3:28:33.360]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
