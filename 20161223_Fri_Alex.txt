[00:00.000 --> 00:18.320]  Waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[00:18.320 --> 00:26.960]  Ladies and gentlemen here we are broadcasting worldwide on this Friday pre-Christmas transmission
[00:26.960 --> 00:35.840]  December 23rd 2016 in just a couple days it's going to be 2017 the beginning of the Trump
[00:35.840 --> 00:42.240]  presidency what are we like 20 24 days out or so until the inauguration we've seen all the
[00:42.240 --> 00:47.200]  incredible moves to keep Trump from getting in that tells you the globalists do not like what
[00:47.200 --> 00:51.840]  they're seeing I'm not saying Trump's perfect nobody is but certainly this is real fear real
[00:51.840 --> 00:57.040]  concern they have thrown the kitchen sink at the American people at the people of the UK and many
[00:57.040 --> 01:02.880]  others trying to keep globalism in place and it's not working so this is major major cause for
[01:03.520 --> 01:10.080]  celebration and I'm not celebrated enough last week whenever they tried to overthrow the electors
[01:10.080 --> 01:15.680]  and intimidate anybody in the death threats it backfired Hillary lost more electors from the
[01:15.680 --> 01:23.280]  electoral college what was it last last Monday on the 19th of December than Trump did a major
[01:24.240 --> 01:32.400]  rebuff a rejection of the entire power of the corporate establishment sewage stream media
[01:32.400 --> 01:39.200]  in their dirty little faces so certainly an exciting situation now as we speak on this Friday if
[01:39.200 --> 01:46.400]  all has gone well I'm going to be listening to the broadcast with you because if you go into the
[01:46.400 --> 01:54.160]  time space continuum I am recording this on Wednesday evening as an intro to a very special
[01:54.160 --> 01:58.960]  retransmission and when I'm on the holidays Christmas time off the family I should be
[01:58.960 --> 02:03.600]  Friday hunting with my son spending some really special time with him I'll be listening in the
[02:03.600 --> 02:07.680]  dear stand I really got enough to do that yeah haven't done as much hunting as I'd like to this
[02:07.680 --> 02:11.680]  year done some bird hunting a little bit of deer hunting so I'll be spending some time around the
[02:11.680 --> 02:17.440]  campfire probably with my son after getting off the deer stand this Friday as we all together
[02:18.080 --> 02:24.560]  listen to Jordan Maxwell they had a very powerful very informative interview with him
[02:25.280 --> 02:31.200]  last week he's going to be retransmitted then we've got Gerald Salente very powerful interview
[02:31.200 --> 02:36.400]  Roger Stone and Matt Bracken and then Jesse James and that's something that aired the night before
[02:36.400 --> 02:41.920]  the election on November 7th uh Jesse James has to do a lot of interviews he's turned on a lot of
[02:41.920 --> 02:46.160]  big you know obviously tv shows he's been demonized by the media and people really don't know who
[02:46.160 --> 02:52.240]  Jesse James is I've known Jesse for about five years now or six years gotta be pretty good
[02:52.240 --> 02:56.160]  friends with him mainly because I lived out in the country about a year after I moved out in the
[02:56.160 --> 03:01.440]  country he moved in next door so my daughter is the same age as one of his daughters and so we got
[03:01.440 --> 03:07.840]  to know each other that way and uh he predicted Trump would win with certainty on that night
[03:07.840 --> 03:11.840]  before broadcast and it was a pretty cool interview it was about an hour and a half live interview
[03:11.840 --> 03:18.240]  we've edited it down to 45 minutes to fit into the hour so that's coming up uh in the fourth hour
[03:18.240 --> 03:23.840]  today and then the sunday rebroadcast is going to be the sunday after the election a few days
[03:23.840 --> 03:27.840]  after when I made my predictions about what was going to happen how they try to stop crumping more
[03:27.840 --> 03:32.400]  a lot of it obviously has come true unfortunately but they have failed and then on monday we've
[03:32.400 --> 03:37.360]  got a big rebroadcast coming up with a max keiser where he was in one day and then in the next day
[03:37.360 --> 03:44.320]  with adam curry then anthony kumia and gavin mcginnis uh that is on monday obviously if big
[03:44.320 --> 03:48.400]  events take place uh over the weekend there's so much is happening i'll be on the air whether
[03:48.400 --> 03:53.120]  it's christmas day or not and i'll be doing live transmissions as well on facebook mentions
[03:53.120 --> 03:59.760]  and on youtube it'll be posted once i've gone live archive to info wars dot com so if something big

[04:06.880 --> 04:13.280]  over this holiday weekend because the globalist model is trying to sneak stuff through over holidays
[04:13.280 --> 04:18.400]  and over holiday weekends uh look for big pardons to be signed uh look for more bizarre executive
[04:18.400 --> 04:23.920]  orders to be rammed through as obama tries to cement his deep-sexing uh of our republic his
[04:23.920 --> 04:28.480]  attempt to bankrupt the free market system because the globalists have to compete with that so all
[04:28.480 --> 04:33.440]  this and more coming up on this friday this sunday this monday and then i'll be back lord willing

[05:10.240 --> 05:15.120]  so much as from the downright ignorance of the nature of coin credit and circulation
[05:15.120 --> 05:19.360]  those are the words of john adams the second president of the united states
[05:19.360 --> 05:24.640]  are you ignorant of the private federal reserve do you understand the nature of our fiat currency
[05:24.640 --> 05:30.000]  do you understand how a private corporation has the ability to create boom and bust cycles
[05:30.000 --> 05:34.640]  and to profit from it what kind of leverage do these people in the federal reserve have
[05:34.640 --> 05:39.040]  over the american people or for that matter what kind of leverage do the southies have
[05:39.040 --> 05:44.640]  over our money will you be a slave or will you be free adams also said liberty cannot

[08:45.200 --> 08:50.320]  like they've done bright bar they are now openly in politico and in the new york times and every
[08:50.320 --> 08:55.040]  other publication basically calling for us to be silenced they've appointed a mail order
[08:55.680 --> 09:02.320]  diploma company with six employees in florida and the snopes couple that has a big fat cat so i
[09:02.320 --> 09:07.760]  i'm serious so that means they will decide what you can visit online via google or facebook it's
[09:07.760 --> 09:13.840]  all being announced so it's an incredible time they've even taken ted coppel out of deep freeze
[09:15.200 --> 09:22.080]  out of his cryogenic to pay uh and had him come out and attack me ted coppel alex jones spreading
[09:22.080 --> 09:28.560]  the manure that fertilizes conspiracy theories all over the internet i love it i grew up watching
[09:28.560 --> 09:33.840]  ted coppel on nightline like he was the biggest genius in the world but i got to be honest ted
[09:33.840 --> 09:39.040]  coppel did not air fake edited audio tapes of me saying hillary cuts up children and rapes him
[09:39.040 --> 09:44.800]  under a pizzeria i was talking about her literally fighting with jihadis to kill people in syria
[09:46.320 --> 09:50.880]  and then they know in the one minute 18 second clip i say that they added it together this is
[09:50.880 --> 09:55.840]  criminal my lawyers i'm not just civil when you're lying about somebody like that to get them hurt
[09:55.840 --> 10:01.120]  there can be criminal penalties but again i should be very very proud of this because it means we're
[10:01.120 --> 10:04.720]  having a big effect i'm on the opposite of a power trip if i'm bouncing off the walls
[10:06.080 --> 10:11.040]  as their energy level against us intensifies god just gives me more energy uh that's the way the
[10:11.040 --> 10:14.880]  universe works for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction to have the communist chinese
[10:14.880 --> 10:19.120]  that's who our top people believe it's pointed towards the state sponsor because it's the u.s
[10:19.120 --> 10:23.200]  doing it it's totally illegal and the chinese have taken credit for these exact type of attacks in
[10:23.200 --> 10:28.160]  october and i showed that pc world article and it appears to be their handiwork but they don't want
[10:28.160 --> 10:32.560]  to say that obviously but but china takes credit for a lot of this stuff so we'll see if they do
[10:32.560 --> 10:37.840]  in the next few weeks it's the second biggest they've ever seen the fbi is obviously involved
[10:37.840 --> 10:45.440]  then i don't mean just the fbi is like very interested because this is unprecedented close
[10:45.440 --> 10:51.280]  to a terabyte a second doesn't mean our service has been penetrated it's not a hack in that sense
[10:51.280 --> 10:56.640]  it's a denial of service using your hijacked computers and hijacked other computer systems
[10:57.280 --> 11:00.800]  that's why we're extending free shipping this entire week it wasn't in the day
[11:00.800 --> 11:06.880]  50% off colloidal silver and up to 30% off on everything else until everything sells out it's
[11:06.880 --> 11:14.960]  the end of year but again we go into the black generally in the middle of december it's that
[11:14.960 --> 11:18.880]  last week where you get five six times the orders you're normally doing a day that allows us to have
[11:18.880 --> 11:26.000]  extra money in the new year to hire new people or to expand they have hit us it's over now $100,000
[11:26.000 --> 11:32.080]  in loss in four days since this began friday saturday sunday again monday because you know the
[11:32.080 --> 11:39.360]  sites are up and down it's very sustained and again these are so these attacks are so huge
[11:40.000 --> 11:46.960]  that they can virtually turn on 10 000 servers and yesterday they went look we got over a thousand
[11:46.960 --> 11:51.360]  servers in big cloud systems nothing's ever beaten this there's no reason to go bigger
[11:52.240 --> 11:58.560]  they said if it beats this is the biggest ever today it went down again and they're like okay we'll
[11:58.560 --> 12:07.120]  go a thousand so it's a major government sponsor and and these guys are very private i mean some
[12:07.120 --> 12:11.680]  of these guys are like presidents and things and vice presidents at major companies and we're talking
[12:11.680 --> 12:17.600]  people that do time warner security nationwide the people that do uh you name it i mean there's only
[12:17.600 --> 12:22.080]  three of these companies and they yet we have confidentiality agreements with them obviously
[12:22.080 --> 12:27.520]  i mean they've turned stuff on for us nobody even knows about that's why i shouldn't get into any of
[12:27.520 --> 12:32.560]  this but let's just say they've turned stuff on for this that other people don't even get access to
[12:33.520 --> 12:37.920]  because there's the old they don't want to get beat if they let the chinese beat this everybody's
[12:37.920 --> 12:43.200]  vulnerable so we're now the test case i mean folks have got their schmores out they've got their uh
[12:44.080 --> 12:48.720]  they've got their marshmallows out they are this is a big party right now guys have been
[12:48.720 --> 12:54.000]  up 48 hours you name it the big brains are being brought in and this is all wargame this is what
[12:54.000 --> 13:00.400]  this is this is the biggest attack since october which was the biggest ever and it's not pointed
[13:00.400 --> 13:07.600]  at anybody but us i mean just in the tech world because of this we're gonna get all the top
[13:07.600 --> 13:12.240]  hackers tuning in now i mean this is like celebrity level stuff this is a people i'm so happy
[13:12.240 --> 13:17.040]  i'm being congratulated by the top people right now i mean this is this is a great honor
[13:17.920 --> 13:23.040]  they said these attacks are 50 times what trump was under and he has a similar system as the same
[13:23.040 --> 13:27.840]  group we have by the way i'm supposed to know that but that's it's true so they're definitely
[13:27.840 --> 13:33.680]  logarithmically upping things so we're gonna break that down info warslife.com info wars store.com
[13:33.680 --> 13:37.360]  in their face let's let them know that we're going to get that capital back we're going to expand to

[14:51.600 --> 14:58.240]  any time he wants in the new year for two hours um he's a hard guy to get on jordan maxwell
[14:58.800 --> 15:01.920]  and he's been through a lot of hacking himself and a lot of persecution we're not going to get
[15:01.920 --> 15:08.480]  into that today but believe me when you're over the target uh it it it certainly happens and i just
[15:08.480 --> 15:13.920]  had his bio here in front of me he's the best-selling author researcher jordan maxwell show dot com
[15:13.920 --> 15:18.800]  he's doing his own show now which is great i'm getting into hidden meanings the illuminati
[15:18.800 --> 15:24.240]  the master plan and today he wants to get into why democrats are so angry why there's a bigger
[15:24.240 --> 15:28.960]  movement going on around the world uh how they manipulate words i want to ask him to he's a big
[15:28.960 --> 15:34.800]  linguist it's how they define things hillary says you are now the alt right even liberals that are
[15:34.800 --> 15:39.120]  poser are now the alt right how they say we're fake news when they're the admitted fake news
[15:39.120 --> 15:43.920]  and how we just accept how they define reality but we're now approaching this point where that
[15:43.920 --> 15:49.280]  isn't happening and i mean here's an example of jordan does we're called human resources since the
[15:49.280 --> 15:56.720]  60s not humans you go research it under eugenics and bioethics human resources can be killed and
[15:56.720 --> 16:02.080]  it's in the us code so i'm gonna skip this break to give him more time jordan maxwell jordan maxwell
[16:02.080 --> 16:08.560]  show dot com joining us as we get ready to finish up 2016 uh he's been predicting the incredible
[16:08.560 --> 16:13.680]  turmoil that's coming what's happening but also the awakening the counter that which the illuminati
[16:13.680 --> 16:19.600]  will try to take over but it's always a race when the bible says get behind me satan the
[16:19.600 --> 16:23.840]  devil's always or that system that calls itself the devil for always trying to counterfeit what
[16:23.840 --> 16:28.640]  the human mind develops that's what we've always got to be trailblazing to get ahead of it that's
[16:28.640 --> 16:32.960]  my view but till the bottom of the hour you've got the floor before i even interrupt or i will
[16:32.960 --> 16:39.440]  jordan get rolling here uh with with where we are in history thanks for joining us well thank you
[16:39.440 --> 16:45.200]  alex for allowing me to be on uh boy there's so many things i want to talk about because
[16:45.200 --> 16:51.120]  everything you said is exactly correct i mean we're under attack uh as americans this whole
[16:51.120 --> 16:56.320]  country is under attack and the reason why is very simple if you don't take down the biggest guy on
[16:56.320 --> 17:01.920]  the block then you don't have anything yet and so this new world order most of the people around
[17:01.920 --> 17:07.600]  the world have no idea what's going on so they're very easy to knock over but america has always
[17:07.600 --> 17:14.400]  been though on the forefront of into intellectual and education and knowledge technology so unless
[17:14.400 --> 17:22.800]  you can destroy this base of resistance to tyranny uh then you haven't done anything that's why they
[17:22.800 --> 17:30.160]  are continually to attack america because america is the only country left that offers freedom of
[17:30.160 --> 17:35.840]  liberty and justice for all and all of that kind of ideas and thinking that comes that came out of
[17:35.840 --> 17:43.680]  the renaissance and so yeah you're right that that we are under attack the point i wanted to make about
[17:44.800 --> 17:51.600]  about under well let me let me first say that uh this whole thing about the democratic people
[17:51.600 --> 17:57.280]  falling out of the chairs because of uh because of the election first of all you need to understand
[17:57.280 --> 18:04.000]  that all communist countries officially are referred to as democratic republics like the
[18:04.000 --> 18:09.520]  uh north korean democratic republic of north korea the democratic republic of
[18:10.080 --> 18:16.080]  cuba the democratic republic of china it's always a democratic republic of the congo
[18:16.640 --> 18:21.600]  of the congo exactly uh it's all around the world any communist country is always a
[18:22.640 --> 18:29.040]  they counterfeited our original republic system but it's a total joke exactly and this is why in the
[18:29.040 --> 18:38.400]  book uh uh fire in the minds of men uh uh james billington who is today the uh the chief librarian
[18:38.400 --> 18:44.320]  for the library of congress this is no slouch chief librarian for the library of congress wrote a
[18:44.320 --> 18:50.960]  book called fire in the minds of men in which he explained this whole idea of calling things
[18:50.960 --> 18:59.840]  democratic and it came out of the old uh 1840s with the communist revolution in 1848 the communist
[18:59.840 --> 19:08.320]  movement etc so uh we need to understand that when you use the word democratic today does not mean
[19:08.320 --> 19:14.400]  the people's democratic thinking and from the greecean empire we're talking about corporate
[19:14.400 --> 19:20.160]  democracy which is actually today called communism sure so we're not talking about we're not talking
[19:20.160 --> 19:25.200]  about a constitutional republic like ours the first and pretty much only not at all we're talking about
[19:25.200 --> 19:32.480]  a democratic republic which means a politburo a secretary at a totally staged event precisely
[19:32.480 --> 19:38.560]  and that's exactly why today the uh communist movement throughout the world is absolutely
[19:38.560 --> 19:46.960]  elated when uh when obama uh was was uh made president because finally they finally got
[19:46.960 --> 19:53.360]  a full blown martis linen as soviet communist old school soviet communist
[19:54.320 --> 20:00.480]  regime in america now and instead even the communist publication said boy now it's time to
[20:00.480 --> 20:06.560]  really destroy this country big time well that's what happened and so you've seen because i've
[20:06.560 --> 20:13.200]  sent you some pictures of uh of the advertisement for hillary clinton talking and using communist
[20:13.200 --> 20:18.000]  terms and symbols and they even use the classic communist paintings where it shows her face and
[20:18.000 --> 20:25.360]  other faces and that's the exact same iconography absolutely so you need to understand that democracy
[20:25.360 --> 20:33.440]  today in america is not uh is not a people's democracy where people matter it's a it's a
[20:33.440 --> 20:41.360]  corporate democracy under world communism so that's so much for the communist party uh and then the
[20:41.360 --> 20:50.160]  uh democratic party in america but you need to also uh in relation to words if you were and i'm
[20:50.160 --> 20:54.960]  going to be and give you an example if you have a two-story building and you're going to put a lot
[20:54.960 --> 21:01.440]  of weight on the second floor the first thing you need to do is go downstairs get on a on a ladder
[21:02.080 --> 21:08.800]  with a uh a building inspector and look at the foundation of the floor that you're going to
[21:08.800 --> 21:13.920]  build on to see if it's going to hold that kind of weight and so what you're doing is you're standing
[21:13.920 --> 21:19.680]  under the foundation that you're going to build on this is where we get our word understanding
[21:19.680 --> 21:25.440]  because you're understanding or standing under what you're hearing but we never learn the basics
[21:25.440 --> 21:31.280]  of things we don't recognize classical tyranny when it's in our face exactly and that's and it's
[21:31.280 --> 21:37.200]  an incredible because that's the way we've been taught we've been taught what to think not how to
[21:37.200 --> 21:42.560]  think so and if you if you have a large package for instance if you have a large package and you
[21:42.560 --> 21:47.360]  want to ship it you go out in the garage you get some rope and you tie up the package and that's
[21:47.360 --> 21:52.720]  good enough but if you're going to take that same rope and tie it off on the end of a ten-story
[21:52.720 --> 21:58.000]  building and hang on it then you better check the integrity of that rope before you go hanging
[21:58.000 --> 22:03.200]  yourself on it and so that's what i'm saying and what is the integrity of what we've seen zero
[22:03.200 --> 22:07.040]  of and i don't want you to get into definitions but you're the master of to get people thinking
[22:07.040 --> 22:11.600]  but just getting into your first point what do you make of this whole election because
[22:11.600 --> 22:15.200]  i mean i want to ask you why do you think i've been allowed to operate the and then now the attacks
[22:15.200 --> 22:19.760]  are getting exponentially more intense there is clearly a global awakening happening they're
[22:19.760 --> 22:23.760]  trying to hijack it but if you look at briggs it if you look at italy starting to pull out
[22:23.760 --> 22:29.280]  spain starting to break up uh rikyovac iceland what's happening in brazil there is a global
[22:29.280 --> 22:35.440]  awakening to all of this as world governments announced they never thought that people would
[22:35.440 --> 22:41.280]  listen to you and i but they did they did listen to ron paul and countless others but i mean i
[22:41.280 --> 22:46.880]  know you're a truest i mean you'll just tell us what you really think not an optimist not a pessimist
[22:46.880 --> 22:52.880]  but jordan maxwell you talk about why the democrats so angry i think it's because they now even at the
[22:52.880 --> 22:58.720]  middle level have been let in on the fact this is a great work a great takeover and they fundamentally
[22:58.720 --> 23:05.440]  see it worldwide uh being destroyed right now yeah and and that's exactly right you know and they are
[23:05.440 --> 23:12.480]  involved this democratic so-called thing is involved in hollywood it's involved in in our
[23:12.480 --> 23:18.160]  all of our institutions because we've allowed it to happen i mean we remember talking you know many
[23:18.160 --> 23:24.080]  years ago about the marxist uh professors and universities but nobody really knew much about
[23:24.080 --> 23:30.080]  what marxism was you know just hit me hit me it's always so thoughtful when you come on say it again
[23:30.080 --> 23:34.960]  it's so thought-provoking of course all the communists call their countries democratic
[23:34.960 --> 23:40.160]  that's a word cooked up by the democratic party which were the jackabins side of the whole illuminati
[23:40.160 --> 23:44.560]  and it's all right there in history but no one knows so break it down sorry that's exactly right
[23:44.560 --> 23:49.600]  let me give you an example of how hollywood is involved in this you know the envy is that we
[23:49.600 --> 23:57.280]  we see on television which is incredible operation today in america and around the world television
[23:57.280 --> 24:04.320]  but the emmies are presented to the world by the national academy of television arts and sciences
[24:04.320 --> 24:11.600]  the first letter in that title is national academy of television arts and sciences which is
[24:11.600 --> 24:19.760]  natas which is spelled backwards satan and when you begin to look at how hollywood was founded
[24:22.080 --> 24:28.800]  back in the ancient times and i've told you this i think before but in ancient times in europe
[24:30.080 --> 24:36.960]  there was a civilization in ancient europe even before the roman empire and it was called druids
[24:36.960 --> 24:42.480]  and this is what we're dealing with today in america and around the world druidism and among the
[24:42.480 --> 24:50.960]  druids uh pre roman empire they're still here today running the world but uh but uh among the druids
[24:50.960 --> 24:56.960]  there was a magic symbol that was very important to druidism in europe and it was a magic wand
[24:57.680 --> 25:03.360]  and and there's like uh merlin the magician with the magic wand mickey mouse with a magic wand
[25:03.360 --> 25:13.360]  also the orchestra conductors use a magic wand to to uh play the music so magic wands were always
[25:13.360 --> 25:19.040]  made out of the wood of a holly tree it's made out of hollywood and once you understand the
[25:19.040 --> 25:26.000]  symbolism the words and the terms and how words are used it's all magic it's all a very high form
[25:26.000 --> 25:31.920]  of druidic professionally done magic and that's right they call it lesser magic to hide the name
[25:31.920 --> 25:37.520]  of it satan right in front of you you don't see it when they see it it takes them up above you
[25:38.400 --> 25:43.120]  they believe prophetically so they have a right to rule you precisely and that's what i've been
[25:43.120 --> 25:48.480]  saying since 1959 and 60 hours by the way that's in standard i mean not the stuff they sell in stores
[25:48.480 --> 25:53.440]  but real 500 year old black magic books that you know come out of babelon in israel it's all right
[25:53.440 --> 25:59.120]  there that's what they do that's exactly right this is a very ancient science that's why today
[25:59.120 --> 26:05.920]  that the study of politics is called political science it's an actual science and so it's based
[26:05.920 --> 26:12.160]  on the ancient magic ancient mystical and the low level stuff is all trash and garbage and
[26:12.160 --> 26:17.680]  false science to control even the upper level minions what percentage would you say this we're
[26:17.680 --> 26:22.240]  kind of reverse engineering this here what what percentage of the actual controllers would you
[26:22.240 --> 26:30.400]  say are full on uh what they would call alchemist wizards uh sorcerers myself i would say a hundred
[26:30.400 --> 26:37.120]  percent because i see it everywhere i see it in newspapers television magazine so you think a large
[26:37.120 --> 26:41.040]  well that's what i i think 20 years ago was a lower number so they're actually now moving to the level
[26:41.040 --> 26:47.040]  of actually educating most their people on what they're doing yes it's it's massive worldwide and
[26:47.040 --> 26:53.040]  that's why people have no idea in the world how big this thing is and i've been talking about it for
[26:53.040 --> 27:01.680]  many years and trying to have trying to get people to listen you know there's a very big uh war
[27:01.680 --> 27:08.480]  and i mean you said it best there's a war for the minds and when you begin to understand how
[27:08.480 --> 27:13.520]  words are used to manipulate us incidentally when you hear people talking about racism
[27:13.520 --> 27:19.440]  look up the word race in a dictionary it's the race is a bloodline of animals
[27:20.000 --> 27:26.080]  the particular kinds of animals are called the uh the dog race the animal race they're getting us
[27:26.080 --> 27:32.000]  to call ourselves animals in the labeling absolutely so that's why today in the british and american
[27:32.000 --> 27:40.080]  styles magazine you will find that uh the styles magazine is put out by by the government uh
[27:40.080 --> 27:45.280]  which has the words that government uses so if you need to you know if you're going to use a word
[27:45.280 --> 27:51.120]  in government you go to the styles magazine and see the correct word to use uh that's being used
[27:51.120 --> 27:59.120]  by the government well if you look up uh in the styles magazine male and female is is a word or
[27:59.120 --> 28:07.360]  words that are given to animals an animal is either a male or female a a man or a woman is masculine
[28:07.360 --> 28:13.840]  and feminine not male and female so therefore people don't know that they don't mind calling
[28:13.840 --> 28:20.480]  themselves male or female and having no idea that that means in government terms and in in
[28:20.480 --> 28:26.560]  courts that means you're an animal and so that goes back that goes back again to the fact that we
[28:26.560 --> 28:32.640]  use chattel terms or of bond slaves that goes back to the middle east and before where we're
[28:32.640 --> 28:38.000]  taking all of that basically it was expanded to what roman common law that's exactly right
[28:38.000 --> 28:42.880]  let me give you another example of how we're being tricked you know uh suppose you were a
[28:42.880 --> 28:48.400]  painting contractor and i call you to paint my office all right you come over and check it out
[28:48.400 --> 28:55.360]  and then you give me uh an estimate of a hundred dollars now after you do the job you come to me
[28:55.360 --> 29:02.480]  the way it is done in commerce you give me a bill for a hundred dollars okay uh i then reach in my
[29:02.480 --> 29:08.240]  pocket now i handed you a hundred dollar bill and now you're happy because i paid you no i did not
[29:08.240 --> 29:15.280]  pay you i did not pay you you gave me a bill for a hundred dollars i gave you a hundred dollar bill
[29:15.920 --> 29:22.560]  so now you owe me look at the look what's on the face of it it's a bank note and you owe me a hundred
[29:22.560 --> 29:26.880]  dollars so i didn't pay you and that's how they get you out of the regular constitutional money
[29:26.880 --> 29:30.880]  into the whole federal reserve system absolutely because it's all their money and it's all debt
[29:30.880 --> 29:34.240]  based it's why the debt always has to go up now let's talk about the election don't doubt about it
[29:34.240 --> 29:38.000]  let's talk about all the democrats are so mad what you i want to the truth i respect you

[33:17.760 --> 33:25.200]  hour he'll be following the latest electoral news around the country as democrats take to the
[33:25.200 --> 33:33.440]  streets they've got movements to get 10 states where trump won to give their electors to hillary
[33:33.440 --> 33:38.560]  saying that states ought to honor the popular vote that would steal the vote of tens of millions
[33:38.560 --> 33:45.360]  and if you cut out the three plus million votes in california if you just cut california out
[33:45.360 --> 33:50.400]  well then obviously trump would have won and there's all the fraud against trump now again i don't
[33:50.400 --> 33:58.240]  think trumps perfect but here's the deal in my view it's not reverse psychology that the communist
[33:58.240 --> 34:03.120]  chinese and the pope who is so incredibly wicked i'm not against catholics folks but that pope
[34:03.120 --> 34:08.320]  let me give me a break he's just out me up one x max what about that uh and the saudi arabians who
[34:08.320 --> 34:13.600]  are pure evil that is their royal government and all the rest of it saying we can't have trump
[34:13.600 --> 34:18.800]  and they're freaking out i believe it's because he wants the old prosperity model of americana of
[34:18.800 --> 34:24.320]  renaissance we have unfair deals it's been designed to bring america down that's well known that's
[34:24.320 --> 34:30.480]  admitted in the major treaties like a june 21 that was never ratified in 92 but we're still under it
[34:31.040 --> 34:36.720]  so i don't think trumps perfect but he's a service guy he makes money off services
[34:36.720 --> 34:41.680]  he likes seeing prosperity and when he sees prosperity being lost it makes him angry
[34:41.680 --> 34:45.840]  he doesn't like being cheated either he's never really been part of the elite as much i know now
[34:45.840 --> 34:48.880]  he's appointed some you know globalists or whatever but that's who knows where the bodies
[34:48.880 --> 34:54.800]  are buried to get things done i care about delivering 50 billion in japanese investment day
[34:54.800 --> 35:00.080]  one he's got his real line with japan and russia now against china he's really following some really
[35:00.080 --> 35:05.520]  smart people i know in the pentagon this is a real attempt at resting control the republic
[35:05.520 --> 35:12.560]  before america's deep six because globalism was sold in the 40s and 50s to end any future world wars
[35:12.560 --> 35:17.280]  just like world war one was used to get the league of nations but it failed and a lot of good people
[35:17.280 --> 35:20.640]  signed on to it to oh we're going to send industry to the third world we're going to give some of our
[35:20.640 --> 35:26.240]  wealth to them build them up it's going to end war but it was all a cheating deal in globalism
[35:26.240 --> 35:30.720]  even the economist admits this to actually impoverish everybody but the elite and depict the winners
[35:30.720 --> 35:36.640]  and losers so a lot of former globalists who meant well are now turning against the new world order
[35:37.520 --> 35:42.480]  because folks were out there like jordan maxwell and and many others exposing what was really
[35:42.480 --> 35:47.120]  happening they weren't all evil a lot of them really meant well i've had professors and others
[35:47.120 --> 35:51.280]  come to me well known folks and go i thought you were wrong trying to take down this great
[35:51.280 --> 35:55.840]  thing we were doing for global peace is for the greater good but i do see before they said some
[35:55.840 --> 35:59.360]  bad things would have to happen for the greater good but i see it's not really true it's all about
[35:59.360 --> 36:04.320]  total control you're right what do we do well now that's a bigger kettle of fish that we'll see if
[36:04.320 --> 36:08.640]  maxwell agrees with me on that statement and i want to walk through what's currently happening and
[36:09.200 --> 36:13.280]  who he seems to be the different power groups and structures here because clearly
[36:13.280 --> 36:19.200]  trump knows how it all works but the words of dr corcy that's only for 40 years he's been basically
[36:19.200 --> 36:24.960]  biding his time and things are a two-way street and he's basically snuck up on them now and that's
[36:24.960 --> 36:28.960]  why they're so scared is that true or is he just coming in and taking the new world order
[36:28.960 --> 36:36.560]  away from them for himself jordan maxwell tell me what you really think well i i like you i kind of
[36:36.560 --> 36:45.440]  like uh trump just as a person as a man i like his method and i like his uh his presentation
[36:45.440 --> 36:51.360]  to the world but what's really important here is the word peace because the communists have always
[36:51.360 --> 36:57.280]  used the word peace what they are talking about if you look in their journals and read their books
[36:57.280 --> 37:04.800]  and read the marxist linness philosophy peace to them means a cessation of againstness meaning
[37:04.800 --> 37:12.480]  the the the the stopping of being against something so when you stop being against something then we
[37:12.480 --> 37:17.840]  have peace that's what it means to them it doesn't mean peace of the world it means submission
[37:18.480 --> 37:24.880]  it means submission so when you're being raped if you're fighting if you got a gun that's dangerous
[37:24.880 --> 37:29.760]  if you if someone's going to be raped and they're carrying a gun that's what i could be dangerous
[37:29.760 --> 37:35.840]  or if they're fighting you and yelling and screaming uh then they're fighting the raping but if you
[37:35.840 --> 37:42.720]  give up then that's peace because nobody's going to fight anymore so that's what marxist lininism
[37:42.720 --> 37:50.080]  in their very publications say that's what peace means to give up and accept marxist lininist
[37:50.080 --> 37:55.280]  communism and the concentration camps and the whole thing that's like whenever palpatine is
[37:55.280 --> 38:02.480]  wiping i'm killing everybody in episode three he says we're bringing peace that's true because if
[38:02.480 --> 38:07.280]  you kill all of the people who want to be free then you're going to have peace everybody else
[38:07.280 --> 38:11.760]  you just turn in the presence and turn in the concentration and notice that's what the orthodox
[38:11.760 --> 38:16.800]  system of islam is it means you will submit but the trick is though once you submit the torture
[38:16.800 --> 38:21.440]  of the killing the enslavement only intensifies because the real religion that george are well
[38:21.440 --> 38:27.440]  exposed whether it be islam whether it be communism fascism is a boot stomping on the human face
[38:27.440 --> 38:33.600]  that's the priest of power and and sadism the jackabins nine day work weeks the world turned
[38:33.600 --> 38:38.960]  upside down no technology but the hands of the elite i mean let's break down the the false
[38:38.960 --> 38:44.080]  illuminati's religion again i'm not saying the illuminati's good or bad the the one we know about
[38:44.080 --> 38:49.200]  in germany and france the counterfeit of what our forebears tried not saying they were perfect
[38:49.200 --> 38:55.040]  either but the great enlightenment frances bacon all of that there wasn't a constituted illuminati
[38:55.040 --> 38:59.520]  but it means bring light to the world the truth is they claim they're illuminated but they're
[38:59.520 --> 39:05.200]  saying only they're illuminated because they bring dark to us correct correct absolutely you have to
[39:05.200 --> 39:10.880]  understand the words that are being used and go back to their reference work to see what those
[39:10.880 --> 39:18.720]  words mean remember that quote i gave to you before it says when freedom no man is safe when
[39:18.720 --> 39:26.320]  freedom fails the best men rot in filthy jails while those who cried appease appease are hung
[39:26.320 --> 39:31.440]  by those they tried to please this has been the case in every communist country in the
[39:31.440 --> 39:38.400]  ever and in the communist overthrow of every country is that you know moussey tongue did it
[39:38.400 --> 39:45.200]  and that's a classic example moussey tongue had people uh put the death because they were voicing
[39:45.200 --> 39:52.320]  their disrespect their disrespect for communism and for the uh the people's democratic republic of
[39:52.320 --> 39:58.480]  china millions of people were put to death by moussey the chinese estimate 84 million and say
[39:58.480 --> 40:04.240]  it was a mistake they kind of locked his wife up every died rca obviously declassified in 2004
[40:04.240 --> 40:10.720]  that they actually put him in power why did they kill the people that submitted why did the kameroos
[40:10.720 --> 40:15.680]  do that as well why kill the i mean like hitler killed the brown shirts that took him to power
[40:16.400 --> 40:24.880]  yeah well uh because because they know that the people who are falling in with them are so stupid
[40:24.880 --> 40:31.680]  that you can't trust them so if you don't stand for something you'll fall for anything so therefore
[40:31.680 --> 40:38.560]  the idea is that the people who willingly go along with you tells the the dictator
[40:38.560 --> 40:43.280]  that these people are so stupid they don't even know what i'm doing and that's incredible they're
[40:43.280 --> 40:47.920]  so stupid so i try and a lot of times these Illuminati people actually take those that were
[40:47.920 --> 40:53.440]  their opposition and try under duress to make them join them they actually respect us that
[40:53.440 --> 41:01.200]  exactly that's it i have had military people say that to me in person they have and i i i don't want
[41:01.200 --> 41:06.480]  to hurt and i don't want to cause harm to anyone in the military but there's the people in the
[41:06.480 --> 41:12.080]  military have come to be in same jordan we respect what you're doing we don't like what's going on
[41:12.080 --> 41:16.960]  either you know we don't we we know what's going on the military why do you think the military in
[41:16.960 --> 41:21.680]  my experience is the most awake group it's because they're on the front lines they don't want to have
[41:21.680 --> 41:28.000]  to go out and put the life in danger and then here the president you know being a great peacemaker
[41:28.000 --> 41:34.400]  and given the novell peace prize and then you come to find out no we got like 35 different wars
[41:34.400 --> 41:40.400]  going on for this man who is supposedly a peacemaker and so the military knows they've been
[41:40.400 --> 41:47.280]  had and if you don't know that all the military has to do with read uh kiss the boys goodbye by
[41:47.280 --> 41:53.040]  henry kissinger the book called kiss the boys he calls them dumb animals dumb animals just
[41:53.040 --> 41:58.320]  to be used for political purposes they're they're all a bunch of animals that's what henry kissinger
[41:58.320 --> 42:06.640]  said and of course george bush's mother uh barbara bush she said if you'll recall that uh when they
[42:06.640 --> 42:13.200]  talked about the people being about our our servicemen being killed she said quote on cnn we've
[42:13.200 --> 42:17.600]  got the club somewhere she said quote still your thunder it's real quote folks you look us up she
[42:17.600 --> 42:21.680]  said i don't think anything of their deaths i don't let that into my beautiful mind that's exactly
[42:21.680 --> 42:27.040]  right she said why why bother me with such nonsense i don't i don't care about how many people are dead
[42:27.680 --> 42:33.680]  that's uh you know the president's mother and uh that's henry kissinger these are the people
[42:33.680 --> 42:38.400]  who are in power think of the arrogance because she went on to say you quoted her exactly she goes
[42:38.400 --> 42:43.600]  why would i bother and let that into my beautiful mind that's exactly what he sends people to die
[42:43.600 --> 42:48.880]  and then she talks about a beautiful mind it just shows the total disconnect like they get jumbo jets
[42:49.520 --> 42:53.040]  you know but but but that hillary tells poor people and obama says you can't have
[42:53.040 --> 42:58.960]  you can't even have a car that's right i i i just think it's incredible that you know if you don't
[42:58.960 --> 43:07.440]  pay your taxes the irs will will will send even if you go to the amazon jungle the irs will find you
[43:07.440 --> 43:13.440]  and bring you back and make an example out of you because you're not going to escape however with that
[43:13.440 --> 43:19.520]  kind of power and that kind of technology they can't stop the drug uh the drug war is going on
[43:19.520 --> 43:25.680]  in pocoyma and california because uh they don't want to that's something let me stop you jorge i
[43:25.680 --> 43:28.720]  want to raise questions a lot of folks don't ask you when you're on and if you'll please come back
[43:28.720 --> 43:33.600]  on to a two hour special uh that we take next week that we then dole out of the show because it's so
[43:33.600 --> 43:39.120]  important you were talking about government drug dealing 40 years ago they were having congressional
[43:39.120 --> 43:43.680]  hearings about it 40 years ago then 20 years ago about cocaine it's admitted now they have movies
[43:43.680 --> 43:48.880]  like saccaro that's basically based on true story they called it fiction so they wouldn't get sued
[43:48.880 --> 43:54.160]  that's actually a true story like word for word of something really happened in south texas and they
[43:54.160 --> 43:58.960]  admit yeah we we we want to control down to two cartels from ten we control the drug trade well
[43:58.960 --> 44:03.600]  that's that's a fact brazinski's written books admitting that in fact the government even runs the
[44:04.640 --> 44:08.880]  key elements of it the white slavery trade and brazinski wrote about that in technotronic
[44:08.880 --> 44:13.200]  era back in the 70s so their argument is we control it by running it but no they actually
[44:13.200 --> 44:19.280]  make it bigger so what what's the paradox now that's so much of world government and government
[44:19.280 --> 44:23.840]  narcotics trafficking and everything else is now out in the open what moment have we reached in
[44:23.840 --> 44:31.360]  I think we finally reached a point in in our evolution of the human family for thousands
[44:31.360 --> 44:38.400]  of years we've come to the point now where we're finally at the very end of a critical period in
[44:38.400 --> 44:45.280]  the total evolution of the human race from over thousands of thousands of years because for the
[44:45.280 --> 44:54.400]  first time we now have the technology to rip off and rape and destroy human minds to manipulate
[44:54.400 --> 45:03.280]  nations upon nations it's an extraordinary war going on between massive tyranny and in the
[45:03.280 --> 45:09.920]  protection of individual humans for freedom and liberty and justice and I'm telling you that
[45:09.920 --> 45:15.040]  that the future is not going to be pretty if you go back and look at what happened in the second
[45:15.040 --> 45:21.840]  world war if you look at what happened in Vietnam all of this is is is heading towards something
[45:21.840 --> 45:29.200]  that the world is will not be able to come back from if we lose freedom freedom is is if it's
[45:29.200 --> 45:34.880]  lost it's gone forever as far as I'm concerned this is the last and final battle on the earth
[45:34.880 --> 45:40.480]  for human dignity and freedom and the people like I said if you don't stand for something you'll
[45:40.480 --> 45:47.280]  fall for anything and if people don't now stand up and understand what's going to understand
[45:47.280 --> 45:54.160]  what's going on uh you know we're going to lose the human race we're not just going to lose America
[45:54.160 --> 45:58.480]  we're not just going to lose human freedom the globalists admit all the top technocracy people
[45:58.480 --> 46:03.040]  from Kurzweil to you name it say we're going to end humanity they've been told by their spirit
[46:03.040 --> 46:08.000]  guides they run google we've got to end humanity be given the big prize and then of course we know
[46:08.000 --> 46:13.280]  that the top alumnus uh armacy clark who took the reins of the thamian socialist told people in
[46:13.280 --> 46:19.120]  speeches no no my my films my books are allegories of what's going to happen but he made the joke
[46:19.120 --> 46:25.520]  it's more like childhoods end we have to consciously give our consciousness up to this devil and then
[46:25.520 --> 46:30.480]  he promises to like upload us to a computer I don't want to do that no you know but that's
[46:31.040 --> 46:36.240]  precisely what's going on that's why I've said and I talked to you before this is a
[46:36.240 --> 46:41.040]  worldwide movement I'm not a conspiracy theorist no I know you're not so let me ask you solve
[46:41.040 --> 46:44.400]  these questions here because I want to get this stuff you never get into I was approached as a
[46:44.400 --> 46:49.280]  teenager by high-level Illuminati people can now see and look where we are today and this is real
[46:49.280 --> 46:54.640]  they could somehow you know through interspace whatever tell that I had to be targeted or recruited
[46:54.640 --> 46:58.640]  it failed I mean talk about stuff out of a movie folks my whole life's been like a movie at least
[46:58.640 --> 47:04.960]  since about age 10 and weird stuff before that I know reading some other writings talking to some
[47:04.960 --> 47:08.640]  other folks you never really written about there's talking about this but I know you weren't a bad
[47:08.640 --> 47:12.880]  guy but you investigated some of these top societies and groups who were actually given
[47:12.880 --> 47:16.800]  interest into some of the real ones that most folks aren't I can tell about the stuff you talk about
[47:16.800 --> 47:21.040]  because I obviously I've been told things most people have been told I mean can you tell us how
[47:21.040 --> 47:28.480]  deep you got into this oh yes very very deep and and it's cost me in everything it's just cost me
[47:28.480 --> 47:35.520]  my life it's cost me my marriage has cost me you know it has really taken a toll on me and the
[47:35.520 --> 47:40.960]  reason why is because there's an old saying you get what you pay for if you want a little
[47:40.960 --> 47:45.200]  knowledge and you pay a little bit if you want a little bit more knowledge okay so you pay a little
[47:45.200 --> 47:49.920]  more if you want to if you want to go to college whether they have to pay a lot but if you want
[47:49.920 --> 47:56.880]  the real story you're going to pay with your life if you want the real actual story about what's
[47:56.880 --> 48:02.720]  going on if you want to learn a little bit about the underworld and the and the organized crime
[48:02.720 --> 48:07.040]  they can read a couple of books and you'll have a little bit of on but if you want to know more
[48:07.040 --> 48:12.000]  about the organized crime you gotta go into it now you gotta go into it a little bit just a little
[48:12.000 --> 48:18.720]  bit and then if you really want to know then join but once you join the only way you leave is in a
[48:18.720 --> 48:27.680]  box and so once you have entered into this kind of knowledge of of redesigning human beings
[48:27.680 --> 48:35.120]  redesigning the whole world once you actually commit yourself to this kind of research you're
[48:35.120 --> 48:39.920]  going to pay and you're going to pay dearly and let's be clear you you get to a certain point
[48:39.920 --> 48:44.320]  even though i've always refused to join the protector of money you you learn the knowledge on
[48:44.320 --> 48:49.440]  your own you you're like one of them even though you didn't want to it's the knowledge of evil
[48:49.440 --> 48:53.760]  you can't it's like and then when you say you pay with your life it's not like they're even doing
[48:53.760 --> 48:59.440]  something to you you're now in it with them even though you don't want to be and if you see them
[48:59.440 --> 49:04.720]  feeding on the public you don't want to the public's coming after you and it's just it's
[49:04.720 --> 49:10.640]  incredible that is precisely what i'm saying that's exactly the feeling i feel continually
[49:10.640 --> 49:17.920]  that's why i have such an empathy for you because i know i have spent my life since 1959 is 60 i was
[49:17.920 --> 49:23.760]  talking about secret societies that's 56 years ago i mean you're probably the the original
[49:23.760 --> 49:29.600]  trellis blazer of exposing the modern illuminati occult well i've been doing for almost 60 years
[49:29.600 --> 49:34.160]  now and but you've got to know were you around before hilder or are you guys were contemporaries
[49:34.160 --> 49:42.080]  no i was out before before hilder and writer and hilder came into my life in 1966 when he put out
[49:42.080 --> 49:51.040]  the uh the illuminati records i was already in 1962 63 even the day john kennedy was assassinated
[49:51.040 --> 49:57.920]  i was going down to east los angeles to give a lecture on secret societies and world government
[49:57.920 --> 50:04.160]  when i heard on the radio that john kennedy had been assassinated and but hilder's a
[50:04.160 --> 50:10.080]  hilder's a character isn't he oh yeah absolutely but i mean he's done a lot as a matter of fact
[50:10.080 --> 50:15.040]  there's more to anthony hill than the meets the eye he has been involved in big motion picture
[50:15.040 --> 50:20.160]  industry he's very well i know you don't have to tell me very intelligent boy he's a very intelligent
[50:20.160 --> 50:27.120]  guy and uh and he put out the illuminati records of which i got back in 1966 you think hilder's
[50:27.120 --> 50:33.040]  ever been with an advanced agency uh i you know i have my own opinions but that's just my opinion so
[50:33.040 --> 50:37.680]  that guy's incredible we gotta get hilder back on agis cc but he is i've known anthony for i don't
[50:37.680 --> 50:44.560]  know 40 years now and uh he's a he's never remarkable he's a piece of worse than he is all right so are

[56:16.560 --> 56:21.040]  left here five minutes the next jordan other little tidbits what do you make of the global
[56:21.040 --> 56:27.360]  power structure how are things going for the new world order well so far as long as the people
[56:27.360 --> 56:34.560]  are kept ignorant ill informed and and can't read and can't think you know i mean in universities
[56:34.560 --> 56:39.920]  and schools teach you what to think but they don't teach you how to think so unless and until
[56:40.720 --> 56:47.360]  you realize that you need to stand up on your own and start looking at the facts of life
[56:47.360 --> 56:52.880]  instead of sitting back and watching television and listening to people you know it's like albert
[56:52.880 --> 57:00.080]  einstein being uh being i feel like it's like albert einstein being taught mathematics by some
[57:00.640 --> 57:06.800]  somebody from a mental institution when you're sitting oh yeah you're sitting watching television
[57:06.800 --> 57:13.760]  people who you know are crooked they are racist they are mentally deranged and what they're saying
[57:13.760 --> 57:18.720]  but they're trying to explain to you what's going on and so i'm exactly all they do is push race
[57:18.720 --> 57:22.880]  like like like history isn't cool things that happened or bad things that happened or or or
[57:22.880 --> 57:27.360]  developments of humanity together and how all humans are the same stuff good bad mentally it's all
[57:27.360 --> 57:31.200]  this was racist this was not mean this was good to make you turn into a victim
[57:32.000 --> 57:39.040]  yeah i know i've i've said before if you were a normal everyday average intelligent person and
[57:39.040 --> 57:45.440]  you take a vacation and you go to a city where there's a huge mental asylum and for the first
[57:45.440 --> 57:51.280]  time you thought you would go visit this mental hospital just to see how things work and you're
[57:51.280 --> 57:56.400]  walking through well everybody in the place is there because they're mentally deranged and they're
[57:56.400 --> 58:03.600]  mentally crippled uh whatever and so but they are arguing with each other they're ranting and raving
[58:03.600 --> 58:08.800]  arguing with each other but they're used to each other they're used to doing that so that's fine
[58:08.800 --> 58:14.400]  with them but when you come in they don't like you at all because you don't talk like them you
[58:14.400 --> 58:19.600]  don't look like them and nobody knows who you are so they are really angry that's right political
[58:19.600 --> 58:23.840]  correctness is right out of the soviet union the exact same term and it creates a basket case
[58:23.840 --> 58:29.040]  lunatics with chips on their shoulders running around bullying everyone you're right that's
[58:29.040 --> 58:34.960]  what i'm saying and so that's why i you know i want to get this plug in real quick right my research
[58:34.960 --> 58:39.120]  i mean my uh my stand there we're going back at 70 seconds jordan we're going right to you
[58:39.120 --> 58:43.520]  jordan maxwell and and listen come back on next week i want to get started a lot i mean i love

[59:46.000 --> 59:49.280]  and vitamin mineral fusion take action now before we sell out
[59:49.280 --> 01:00:08.640]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:16.480]  from the front lines of the information war
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:26.320]  for its alex jones
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:36.160]  uh
[01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:47.200]  under leftist brainwashing this german arena barana music would be called nazi or it would be called
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:56.720]  it would be called cultural expropriation everything's a thought crime every word uh every
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:02.240]  new vocabulary they give you will then be made obsolete within the month or within the year
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:09.040]  so that they can sit in the place of arbor trading what words can be used what culture can be adopted
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:14.720]  that's why it starts with something simple like don't call us homosexual that's scientific term
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:21.520]  like heterosexual hurts us call it straight call it gay you go okay i want to be nice you're gay
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:25.840]  you're happy you can expropriate words now and you know basically without even going to court
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:33.600]  just just just you know change scientific terms and then now don't say you have a mother and father
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:38.720]  some people don't have that don't say brown paper bag that hurts people's feelings that's racist
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:42.480]  no one ever said it was racist but we say it is so you can't use that term now
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:48.000]  and by the way don't say this is an islamic attack that only encourages more of the attacks
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:53.920]  we're gonna arrest you if you say this was islam we've hired former stasi to do it
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:02:02.240]  i mean it's like they think the public has collective amnesia it's our job to expose the fact
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:10.880]  that this is a cult multiculturalism is about bringing in all these other people who are just
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:15.760]  people they act just like people act like white people act like black people humans act the same
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:24.400]  and then they program the minorities to be race-based it's incredible absolutely amazing now we're
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:30.480]  going to uh after the break get some guests on the broadcast we have quite a few today
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:34.320]  Gerald Salente is coming up at the bottom of the hour to give us his breakdown of what we've seen
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:39.200]  in the year past and what's coming up in the future we've got roger stone popping in he's
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:43.040]  decided to rally and come on for about 10 minutes even though he's got a cold or is under the weather
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:47.840]  from from not sleeping as much as he should writing this book he's been working 18 to 20 hours a day
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:57.680]  in the last few weeks and then we've got uh paul joseph watson scheduled to be hosting the fourth
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:03.760]  hour today from london england he's got some guests joining him as well so you don't want to
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:10.000]  miss all of the rest of the three hours that are laid out before us now i need to take a
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:16.800]  breath here and just sit back and think about what we've just witnessed i have really not spent any
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:30.800]  time so far talking about the fact that we have seen donald j trump come from way behind to get
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:36.560]  the nomination despite the fact they tried to steal that outrageously to becoming president elect
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:42.560]  and then now the last five weeks of total hysteria trying to stop that and trying to have recounts
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:48.320]  that only got him more votes and uh trying to then launch wars and other diversions and trying to
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:53.040]  say there's a terror attack it's his fault and then saying
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:04:04.160]  that again the electors shouldn't go for him despite all that he got what 303 electors
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:12.240]  of the 270 needed and they had a bunch of electors actually go against hillary more electors went
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:18.640]  against hillary even though no one promoted that then went against trump so it actually backfired
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:25.600]  in another incredibly repudiating reversal and just showing people don't want her
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:31.200]  and i'm glad it was bernie sanders people that realized they stole the nomination from him that
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:38.560]  said you know what we're going to be faithless for you because you were faithless and stole this
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:47.200]  she lost four in washington state alone so that's all coming up on the other side of this quick
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:51.920]  break we've got video and audio of them getting hysterical and crying and screaming when they're
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:56.640]  when they're goddess the arrogant stumbling tyrant failed
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:03.520]  it was thomas jefferson who once said that our country is now taking so steady of course as to
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:08.160]  show by what rodeo will pass to destruction to wit by consolidation of power first and then
[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:12.560]  corruption it's necessary consequence jefferson was warning us about the global elite the one
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:17.120]  percent of the one percent consolidating the world's wealth and subverting the people's voice in
[01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:21.680]  government unfortunately we didn't heed his advice we now live in a neo feudalistic society
[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:25.840]  in which we're treated as indentured servants who only exist to serve the needs of the establishment
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:30.080]  political office no longer represents the voice of the people but rather the initiation process
[01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:34.560]  politicians go through to gain acceptance into the aristocracy simply put we the people are
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:38.720]  responsible for civilization and culture yet we're suppressed by a tiny elite who have organized
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:42.880]  into criminal gangs that operate governments around the world we falsely believe that everything is
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:47.280]  simply black and white one extreme against the other conservative versus liberal but things
[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:52.000]  will change once more of us realize this truth as thomas jefferson also said enlighten the people
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:56.400]  generally and tyranny and oppressions of the body and mind will vanish like evil spirits at the dawn

[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:34.800]  that's full now everybody knows that i'm obsessed with how the global social engineers are able to
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:39.360]  set the parameters and label things they call themselves progressives they call themselves
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:46.080]  liberals then when they're in opposition to what libertarians and patriots want they say oh you're
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:52.320]  right-wing extremists and then they couple everybody else onto the horrible agenda being
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:59.760]  carried out by the fake establishment blue blood robber baron republicans but then in real policy
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:05.920]  the democrats and republicans carry out the globalism carry out the modern imperialism
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:11.040]  carry out the modern oppression and then respectively point fingers at each other and
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:17.200]  say everybody does it well carol quickly wrote tragedy in the hope of the 60s for the cia because
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:24.560]  their own section chiefs couldn't understand why they were funding communist socialist and fascist
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:30.960]  as well as just run-of-the-mill dictators instead of promoting liberty they were changing over from
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:35.280]  the eisenhower policy of trying to put good governments in which is bad enough because
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:41.520]  you see where it goes to putting bad governments in and quickly in the book which we sell by the
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:47.760]  way in hardcover it's back in print 1100 pages wasn't meant for the general public there were
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:53.920]  lawsuits over it but because the government paid for it it went into open domain when first only
[01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:59.840]  a few copies were out there that got leaked they tried to deny it was real in the early 70s folks
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:07.280]  there was a whole controversy over this book 1100 pages you read it it's it's a blueprint
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:13.600]  a a owner's manual an operator's manual on how to run full spectrum political dominance
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:21.280]  but at the end it's all command and control and it's anti free market and wants monopolies
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:27.200]  oligopolies brazil he's written books that are public admitting it all as well but those are public
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:35.040]  and so that's why they're bringing in islam because it's not compatible and so the leftist
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:40.560]  who hate the states and who hate the electoral college uh and who you know all this other garbage
[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:47.280]  suddenly love it and love the states and said be faithless electors well hillary clinton lost
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:56.480]  more electors than trump did in fact i did the math yesterday the issue was even in states where
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:11:01.680]  people are allowed to be faithless they just ignored them arrested them drug them out you name it
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:07.200]  imagine if trump people did that turns out i counted these up last night hillary lost more
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:19.040]  than 30 electors trump just lost a few incredible so hillary lost four in washington the reason
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:25.440]  that's so important that's where the four stuck they went to bernie sanders in other places they
[01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:29.680]  just ignored it and it was not even in the news or it was mentioned well they you know this group
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:35.360]  of seven or this group of four this group of ten or this group of two tried to vote against but weren't
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:43.120]  allowed the police took them out so i sat there before i shot a live video on facebook last night
[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:47.760]  and i tally him up so and there's also mainstream news articles that also admitted it they're like
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:54.480]  yeah hillary was rebuffed or hillary lost more than trump so imagine they're advertising they're
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:58.160]  writing thousands of letters to each elect or his republican they're doing they have hollywood
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:07.280]  stars saying do this do this do this do this and they get rebuked because hillary joe biden
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:13.200]  had to go out on the trail and say i know you don't like hillary i know you like cinders but man
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:20.000]  donald trump's evil and record numbers of reagan democrats black and white and hispanic
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:25.840]  those type of folks went and they voted for trump the same people that voted for obama hoping for
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:32.000]  change and if trump doesn't deliver or die trying he'll be more hated than obama because people weren't
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:38.400]  sure but gave obama a chance i didn't like mccain myself so i was i was like i'm pretty much neutral
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:43.280]  except mccain claims he's less anti-gun so i gotta go mccain but i didn't vote for him i just said
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.720]  we're gonna see what happens and boy obama was worse than i thought i hated the republicans
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:54.880]  so much that one of the few times i was wrong in my life i didn't support mccain and of course he
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:59.920]  was meant to lose so it was like a don king boxing match they say you know reportedly allegedly
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:04.880]  sometimes you know both boxers kind of know what's going on who knows the point is with in that case
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:09.040]  we knew the fix was in so i said hey the fix is in it doesn't matter he's the new messiah we'll see
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:17.200]  what happens but boy the racial division all of it so you've got these whining babies in wisconsin
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:26.640]  wailing and freaking out here it is thank you tellers for uh telling the votes the votes are
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:48.640]  ten votes donnell j trombone
[01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:01.120]  this is on america america's been stolen don't do this
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:05.280]  this is begging for hillary
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:13.920]  this is begging for hillary who launches all these wars steals the donation money from the Haitians
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:22.000]  he's involved in all this corruption and they're saying shame shame shame shame on you
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:28.560]  for vice president and then they go on and uh choose the electors also for mr pence
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:34.800]  now vice president pence elect but about to be president in 30 days you think these desperate
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:41.680]  people are going to stop now notice they blamed the racist and they blamed uh the homophobes uh
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:49.520]  now your russian agents uh if you support trump you want world war three even though most analysts
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:53.760]  and historians on the left and right say no no hillary would push this towards world war three
[01:14:55.520 --> 01:15:00.160]  trump's a businessman he wants to win win he doesn't want austerity he doesn't want eugenics
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:04.880]  he doesn't want world war three that's what the whole devos system is they're ultra rich you're
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:10.000]  poor they end the competition they sew up the whole world they're diplomatically immune above the
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:17.680]  law tax exempt globalism is the new royalty and you only operate through license through licensure
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:22.240]  to them and administrative law that's what the world government is read the white papers
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:29.520]  and because i have read their white papers i've been contacted and i've been offered jobs with them

[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:23.440]  sense of sadness and loss gave way to a tremendous tremendous anger as we've realized from all the
[01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:29.360]  news is coming out that this election was stolen from the american people by russia what evidence
[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:35.760]  do you have that russia stole the election there was information from the cia saying that russia was
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:41.760]  meddling in the election what evidence do you have that it swayed the outcome the hacking that
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:48.160]  the russian government did of the dnc units provided use the term hack to mean political
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:53.760]  hack influence in the media okay that's it's all been disproven the head of all intelligence has
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:58.400]  come out and said it's all bull but the chinese and the sari arabians were openly involved bragging
[01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:03.200]  about it and look how helpless these women look do you think folks like this built this country
[01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:07.520]  of that they've created these soft bureaucrat types that are in law all in here they are
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:16.240]  that the russian government did of the dnc emails provided an endless supply of negative
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:23.120]  commentary in the news about hillary how many people think that russia swayed the outcome
[01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:29.680]  of this race had it not been for russia hillary clinton would have won you know what it was
[01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:35.120]  that we're gonna come back and play the rest folks this is so assamine the entire mainstream

[01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:45.680]  electors some say there could still be some manipulation up until the sixth or so when

[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:41.040]  the subject from the wiki leaks it's so ridiculous talk about a conspiracy theory it was us intelligence
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:46.000]  linked the information it was us intelligence linked up with the russians and gave intel on
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:53.040]  helping kill isis our military told obama three plus years ago it stops now and i told you that

[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:45.680]  disinformation network with these poor democrat voters the hacking that the russian government
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:54.080]  did of the dnc emails provided an endless supply of negative commentary in the news about hillary
[01:28:54.080 --> 01:29:01.600]  how many people think that russia swayed the outcome of this race had it not been for russia
[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:08.560]  hillary clinton would have won you agree with that i don't know well we don't we don't know yet
[01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:14.960]  but for months and months and months all of the american voters were swayed by what they
[01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:20.640]  heard and saw in the news the other thing i thought was um a big factor is the fake news on
[01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:26.160]  facebook why which what fake news story cost for the i would say that the fake news and the
[01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:29.680]  russia stuff are very connected because a lot of the fake news came out of
[01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:36.000]  people's interpretation of the leaks a lot of new leads deciding voters uh broke for
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:40.880]  trump and the komi email it sort of seemed to line up in terms of timing with the komi email
[01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:46.160]  what i don't hear you saying is putting in a responsibility on her campaign what percent
[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:55.520]  the empire's on the run they'll be back alex jones and jason radio network

[01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:08.480]  monster that would take over not only the sovereign states that had created it but that it would
[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:14.400]  become a tool to destroy individual liberty his warnings ignored have now come to pass he said

[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:44.400]  that not even our elected representatives are allowed to see later in life patrick kenry looked
[01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:49.120]  back and said when the american spirit was in its youth the language of america was different
[01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:55.280]  liberty sir was the primary object today our primary concern is safety and comfort when we

[01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:46.400]  down because this type of news drives me crazy to witness niece this summer to witness berlin as an
[01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:51.840]  18-wheeler runs over men women and children and to watch the media be apologists and to cover up
[01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:58.880]  for orthodox islam and to know they knew bringing in millions of military aged men from war torn
[01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:05.680]  areas where their cult is so out of control they're constantly all killing each other i mean i don't

[01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:24.320]  when i'm looking at one and the brand of islam coming out of saudi arabia's rear end that sprayed
[01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:31.600]  all over europe and the rest of the world is a cult the only other freakier weirder one is north korea
[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:38.160]  and i've decided which one's worse quite frank and i can make that judgment north korea is freaking
[01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:46.080]  crazy a hereditary dictator that executes family members with mortar fire with three days of
[01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:51.520]  screaming and crying and worshiping him when he walks around or his dad dies i mean the only time i
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:35:02.480]  see this when hillary lost it was the same trump's gonna cut our taxes he's gonna murder the gay people
[01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:06.560]  and the right wing was like oh this is wonderful we're gonna vote for trump and i was like

[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:26.320]  about trump and then the left's business goes oh he conjures see he made you think he was right
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:36.800]  wing no he didn't he's nationalistic he's kind of strong manny but compared to globalist trying
[01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:43.840]  to destroy the country i'll take trump any day i mean he does radical stuff like doesn't give
[01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:48.080]  species by christmas trees and says merry christmas what type of culture we are the president can't

[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:19.360]  is a false flag uh here it is ambassador assassination russian officials blame nato turks blame gulan russian
[01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:24.080]  mp blames nato conspiracy for killing of ambassador in turkey that's out of the independent yeah it
[01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:29.760]  calls it a false flag both of those terms are now in the vernacular in the nomenclature uh
[01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:35.600]  putin russian ambassador murder aimed at undermining syria peace process yeah that's exactly what it is
[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:40.480]  russian officials highly likely ambassador assassination of nato false flag that's in
[01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:48.080]  full wars dot com we actually get what the russians said continuing russian diplom out found dead
[01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:55.200]  from a gunshot wound at home just hours after ambassador killed at art exhibition and roboma
[01:36:55.200 --> 01:37:00.640]  said we will counter russia at the time of our choosing that's what you're seeing a lot of russian
[01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:05.200]  intelligence operas live the head of intelligence has been killed uh it's it's it's it's it's they're
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:09.840]  really trying to start a war with russia now do i do that start killing putin's drivers start
[01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:14.000]  killing the ambassador start killing members of the media then blame it on putin not saying putin's
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:19.360]  an angel by any means but he's not expanding he's not he's trying to stabilize russia which they don't
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:26.000]  like they were strong like china they'd be bullying us like they're doing so that's some of what we've
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:31.440]  got to break down there is so much to go over gerald salentes one of the top trends forecasters in the
[01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:36.400]  world best-selling author one of my favorite guys to interview and one of the audience's favorite
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:40.560]  guest i appreciate him coming on on short notice today i just wanted to get him to respond to all
[01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:45.680]  those trends research dot com uh gerald i gotta say you look very very sharp today uh you always
[01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:50.400]  look sharp but i really really really like that uh like that style you're you're kicking today my
[01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:56.000]  friend uh what would you like to begin i mean what we're seeing with trump being seated uh if they're
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:01.200]  this desperate where are they going of the the ambassadorship uh the the latest jihad attack
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:07.680]  here's what i like to start i like to start with bill clinton yesterday
[01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:16.800]  trump knows how to get angry white men to vote for him i guess maybe he said that you know bill
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:23.600]  clinton smoked but he didn't inhale maybe he inhaled because this is from the trends journal
[01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:28.240]  the current issue when we reviewed the election
[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:41.680]  trump received about the same number of white male votes as did mit romney in 2012 so bill
[01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:48.320]  that's why you got the name slick willie because you and the rest of the prostitute media
[01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:55.680]  are putting out this lie here are the facts they're all outlined in the trends journal which you
[01:38:55.680 --> 01:39:07.680]  have remember trump got the same amount of white male voters as did mit romney in 2012 we go on to
[01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:13.840]  say despite hillary clinton playing the first woman to be elected president gender card
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:24.960]  she received two million fewer votes from women than obama did in 2012 i'm mentioning this alex
[01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:30.320]  because everybody's playing that stupid show facts are the facts are the very same people that
[01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:35.600]  elected obama elected trump they want change they want a good economy they don't want world war three
[01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:43.040]  you got it so but they're sending the propaganda that the russians did it because maybe you know
[01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:49.520]  it wasn't the russians because if the russians only had clinton how come the democrats got
[01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:56.080]  creamed in the house lost the senate lost the state houses across the country biggest state
[01:39:56.080 --> 01:40:04.400]  loss ever 900 state seats lost right had nothing to do with the russians it had to do with the
[01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:10.240]  trader in chief the guy that went around in campaign wait a minute i burned my toast this morning
[01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:13.920]  and the dog ate my homework back in fifth grade you're saying that wasn't the riskies
[01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:22.800]  again it was the trader in chief obama who lied his way into the office campaign more than any other
[01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:28.960]  sitting president in modern history for clinton going around the country with that arrogant
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:35.680]  attitude about hey folks folks you want to keep my you want to keep my folks you want to keep my
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:42.640]  legacy alive this is what they said to his legacy at the senate in the house and all the legislatures
[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:47.680]  it had again those are the facts so the people want to talk to russian crap and they want to
[01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:53.040]  talk about white male votes just got rid of that one because here's another number remember
[01:40:53.040 --> 01:41:03.040]  two million women fewer voters than than obama in 2012 more importantly just 30 percent of eligible
[01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:11.680]  women cast their ballots for clinton compared to 47 percent who did not vote nothing to do with
[01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:17.680]  the russians and she's played the went gender card and the women said because you saw the polls
[01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:25.760]  60 percent of the people that went to the polls thought that clinton was untrustworthy and dishonest
[01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:29.520]  and by the way let's go further because i'm here going off their own mainline polls they've been
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:35.600]  proven to add seven nine twelve fourteen fifteen on average about nine points more for hillary and
[01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:41.440]  all these polls not just popularity polls not just voting polls but but all these indexes
[01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:45.920]  they've also been caught uh currently trying to hold down trump's polls even though they're actually
[01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:51.200]  rising so the truth is wasn't this a total repudiation of the mainstream media's credibility
[01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:58.720]  which ap admits was it six percent pre-election might even be negative now it might be here again
[01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:04.640]  these are the facts because everybody's glossing over it and they give slick willy clinton all this
[01:42:04.640 --> 01:42:08.960]  coverage sure sure so how do we counter the claim that it's a white lash another attempt to race
[01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:14.560]  bait what do we do right but again well you keep doing what we're doing but again here's the
[01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:21.520]  race bait card you ready for this one two million some two million black voters who cast ballots for
[01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:31.360]  obama in 2012 they didn't cast ballots for clinton so it has nothing to do with the russians it has
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:38.320]  to do with who they are so what do we do what we do is we have to keep calling out the fake media
[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:45.600]  because as soon as trump got elected the first day in usa today how could a sitting president
[01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:53.920]  who has 74 lawsuits against him go into the white house a words to that effect this was the coverage
[01:42:53.920 --> 01:43:04.560]  after obama won look at the coverage and for radio listeners it's it's the new yorker with
[01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:09.120]  his most rodents is ready we gotta remind folks of that it's obama is george washington it's all
[01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:16.000]  positive obama's loving he's good he's an angel and now the coverage is trump's a demon that's it
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:21.600]  look at the hypocrisy the media i think maybe now maybe obama is going to play hamilton uh
[01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:27.520]  yeah he could probably pull that off got the wig yeah but wait general i've got this super secret
[01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:31.440]  photo of the cia released to obama we're now releasing it's on screen for tv viewers info
[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:36.960]  wars.com forks last show uh democrats got this secret photo of a room full of russian hackers
[01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:42.240]  the day before the election it's actually 50 000 trump supporters filling a 50 000 person
[01:43:42.240 --> 01:43:49.120]  stadium uh but that was all russian hackers gerald yeah this is the this is the hypocrisy of the
[01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:58.320]  media this is the new york magazine all new the truly radical politics of barack obama
[01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:08.960]  look at the hypocrisy of what the media did then and what they're doing now so as we see it this is
[01:44:08.960 --> 01:44:16.640]  going to be one of the biggest changes that we have going to witness in our lifetimes as far as
[01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:22.560]  politics i want to put this into perspective because we just heard for what a week and a half
[01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:28.240]  watch out for the electoral college you've been covering it or we don't need to go into the details
[01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:34.080]  they did that for a week and a half the two weeks has been the russians are coming the russians
[01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:42.080]  are coming come january 20th none of this is going to be important a whole new direction
[01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:48.800]  is going to take place yes it is going to be crying by the little liberals you're not going to count
[01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:55.280]  on i have never been more positive and i've been on your show for a decade at least
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:02.800]  i looked it up about 12 years yeah and this and people would say oh that's valente's a gloom
[01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:08.000]  and doomer i was a gloom and doomer when the facts were there because here's the facts
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:15.680]  why did trump win we said why back in may it's the economy stupid since obama's been in 95
[01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:20.320]  percent of the wealth has gone to the 1 percent so yes that's why i'm negative by the way let me
[01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:24.720]  just say this because i'm on the same page just because of optimism suddenly restaurants are up
[01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:28.800]  suddenly small shops are getting more business over a trillion's been added to the stock market
[01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:33.360]  he's already bringing back all these massive jobs just on the confidence it makes the world
[01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:38.400]  confident about us instead of just pooping that we could ever have a future we're america
[01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:43.200]  that's still sexy all over the world people want america to come back they want america to be
[01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:48.640]  successful they want the old america that people really did trust and really did like that you've
[01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:53.040]  been talking about so people say oh alex you know i thought the government's all evil suddenly you
[01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:59.280]  love it no i'm saying we've got a shot at trying to make it better again and not being the legion of
[01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:04.560]  doom and it's very very exciting and trump is already delivering but he's riding a wave that
[01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:09.520]  you predicted two years ago three years ago i was more than that how many years ago wasn't you put
[01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:14.720]  out a special issue on nationalism globalism in crisis in the next few years and i'll be honest
[01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:19.280]  gerald i said on air i hope you're right because i thought you were being too optimistic uh you
[01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:26.560]  saw it coming uh who else saw it coming uh there was a few others uh oh uh the former head of black
[01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:31.920]  ops for the uh the really cia not just a department but a steve pacinic saw it coming five years ago
[01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:37.200]  how did you see that coming well again because of why the elections are going on around the world
[01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:41.280]  the people have fed up with the elite yeah but you saw it before it happened how many years ago
[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:47.120]  said oh thanks but you know it's our work you know so we try to look beyond what the people are saying
[01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:53.280]  and what they're feeling so going back to what you were just saying it's it's one of our top trends
[01:46:53.280 --> 01:47:00.000]  think of trump's campaign slogan and why we are optimistic about the future make america great
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:07.840]  again so one of our trends are true nostalgia when was again look at the difference for example
[01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:12.400]  you know as i mentioned to you on your show it wasn't that only clinton got beat
[01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:19.600]  you we saw obama got beaten major media got beaten by trump the rappers got beaten beyond
[01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:24.720]  say the entertainment industry hollywood silica they threw everything they could against us and
[01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:32.960]  they lost that's right they lost silicon valley lost now let's take silicon valley with that arrogant
[01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:40.160]  attitude that they have they know best one thinking mind look at the way they dressed look at that
[01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:47.280]  sucker burger he shows up all the time in a t-shirt look at the way the trump children dress look at
[01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:53.840]  the way trump puts out things go back to make america great again think of true nostalgia
[01:47:53.840 --> 01:48:00.640]  whatever you want to make it up in your mind however you want to bring 1950s 2.0 or whatever
[01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:06.400]  you want it to be elegance grace and style you've always obsessed on if people don't dress nice
[01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:09.600]  and they don't care about their own environment they don't care about you and you're right the
[01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:15.200]  sloppishness well they they declassified the cia in the 50s and 60s put out ugly art and ugly
[01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:20.480]  architecture to make us feel small and depressed that's declassified you've always harped on this
[01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:27.040]  and now it's all admitted that's a good point and now you have trump presenting it look at his
[01:48:27.040 --> 01:48:34.320]  daughters look at his sons look at the way they show up they're not like what i'm saying is from
[01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:43.040]  for people that want to become entreprenuers seize the moment make it new make it old retro fit it
[01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:49.440]  do whatever you it's energy it's a spirit we need exactly and that's what he's bringing back
[01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:55.520]  but he's not talking about it it's what he does and a number of the people that he's bringing on
[01:48:55.520 --> 01:49:03.200]  with them live at that kind of lifestyle so what we're saying as trend forecasters is for the people
[01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:09.200]  listening for the people that want to move ahead seize on what he's doing play the trump card so
[01:49:09.200 --> 01:49:16.320]  for example let's say you want to make sneakers play the trump card come out with made with pride
[01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:23.200]  in america's your footwear whatever and then start running ads up where nike is if everybody piggybacks
[01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:28.320]  on that you'll have market dominance in just a couple years exactly i mean people ask why my show
[01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:33.520]  is so successful people want americana they want success and if you believe in it humans can do
[01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:39.840]  anything it's about confidence and globalism was about austerity we're poor it's all over submit to
[01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:44.960]  it go away you've got to be poor i mean it's it ought to be easy for us to beat these people
[01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:49.760]  if we simply deliver and and and again here's the problem you're right about all this i agree with you
[01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:54.320]  a huge renaissance is coming back worldwide not just trump he's just riding the wave
[01:49:55.200 --> 01:49:59.360]  the globalists are going to strike back gerald look at their hysteria i'm concerned the next 30
[01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:06.480]  days what do you think you know as i said the next 30 days are important but once trump gets in the
[01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:12.800]  whole the whole scenario what we're hearing now of all this worthless fake news is going to go away
[01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:17.760]  but i want to make one point about playing the trump card if you look what trump did the first
[01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:24.640]  thing he did when the camp the during the campaign he took out the top guy he went over to george
[01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:29.520]  jeb bush put his hand on his shoulder a national teller yeah you're a nice guy but you really don't
[01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:34.800]  have it oh i mean knocked out one top guy after another so when you're making pride with america
[01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:41.760]  products you're going to make footwear start running ads up in aragon and say hey fill night
[01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:47.920]  the guy with nikey over there what are you getting your shoes made from slave labor workers over there
[01:50:47.920 --> 01:50:53.360]  bringing them back to america just like he's shaming bowing to moving a lot of bowing back
[01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:59.680]  exactly he's using that bully pulpit and that's what he's supposed to do notice obama said oh
[01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:04.560]  what do you have some magic wand uh and of course he did end up having a magic wand didn't he
[01:51:05.600 --> 01:51:11.680]  we got to keep the show clean no but what i'm saying is exactly i'm saying the magic wand is
[01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:17.440]  common sense saying hey if china's got a 15 lower tax than we do we've got to lower to that level
[01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:21.520]  and then boom the jobs come right back this is not rocket science yeah but what i'm saying is
[01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:28.720]  for the entrepreneur to play the trump card you start going after the people that are importing
[01:51:28.720 --> 01:51:34.160]  all these crappy products marking them up and becoming billion i agree i agree i mean i mean the
[01:51:34.160 --> 01:51:38.560]  plan was in the in the last few decades we just sell out america now the attitude is we're coming
[01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:45.680]  back so it's that idea exactly so what we're saying is the people to seize on the opportunity
[01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:55.040]  it's there and trump is showing it how do they say that in latin carpe diem yeah seize the moment
[01:51:55.840 --> 01:51:59.920]  all right now now let me as i skip the break i won't take a few calls here and get their ideas
[01:51:59.920 --> 01:52:04.400]  on how they think they may try to overthrow trump before even gets in look at all they've done
[01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:08.640]  past behavior is the greatest indicator of future uh you know uh performance or behavior
[01:52:08.640 --> 01:52:12.000]  but i want to just cover a few other little tidbits quickly boom boom boom with you
[01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:17.200]  from the trench journal jerry salento trends research dot com what about the fed obviously
[01:52:17.200 --> 01:52:21.600]  they've kept interest rates low forever but if they raise them it's a problem if you do it's a problem
[01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:26.160]  if you don't but suddenly because the economy heats up uh because of confidence with trump it's
[01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:31.120]  still in bad trouble suddenly they want to raise them what do you make of that i think they're
[01:52:31.120 --> 01:52:37.760]  going to raise them the forecast are now maybe two times more they have to come up it's going to
[01:52:37.760 --> 01:52:43.200]  what it's going to do it's going to hurt them mostly the foreign countries because they borrowed
[01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:49.360]  all that money the emerging markets particularly china in in cheap dollars so now they have to pay
[01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:54.000]  them back in dollars but their currencies are going down and now notice the dollar is strong
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:58.880]  again it's like a magic switch got thrown when trump got elected because i guess it's signaled
[01:52:58.880 --> 01:53:05.520]  we're not laying down anymore yes and again look at the people he's bringing in for negotiating
[01:53:05.520 --> 01:53:12.400]  whether it's will boros mnuchin is tillerson i mean these guys look at the experience that they
[01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:16.560]  have yeah folks are saying oh more rich people it's not rich people that stole the money at hedge
[01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:21.280]  funds or whatever it's people that actually are the best salesman in the world that have connections
[01:53:21.280 --> 01:53:28.560]  everywhere i mean they say rick tell us it is the genius choice again if they do what they did
[01:53:28.560 --> 01:53:35.760]  for their businesses but we the people this is the kind of guy i would want to hire and what we
[01:53:35.760 --> 01:53:39.360]  in all that they have well we shouldn't just hire more lawyers that never did anything
[01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:46.240]  here right or a politician by the way i think politicians should be banned from running for
[01:53:46.240 --> 01:53:51.200]  office these people never work by the way guess what rex Tillerson is he's an engineer that's it
[01:53:51.200 --> 01:53:55.760]  we started in texas at oil wells now he runs one of the biggest corporations in the world
[01:53:55.760 --> 01:54:00.080]  everybody loves him all over the planet and they are so scared right now because they know what this
[01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:07.520]  lineup means trump is about to just absolutely dominate bringing jobs back and and again that's
[01:54:07.520 --> 01:54:11.360]  the plan that i was told about even beforehand which is pretty much the americana plan but now
[01:54:11.360 --> 01:54:15.680]  it's in um of course in the whole plan that was put out in the hollywood reporter article with
[01:54:15.680 --> 01:54:19.600]  steven bannon the chief advisor they know the leftist plan to make everybody poor to control
[01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:24.800]  them they plan to bring in so much wealth that even the poorest people see such big results
[01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:29.840]  that they basically turn against collectivism forever they're attempting to kill communism
[01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:34.880]  but actually deliver the plan at the end of linen of the state withering away did you i mean
[01:54:34.880 --> 01:54:42.400]  that's pretty hardcore alex this is the time for america to become a self-sustaining economy
[01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:50.480]  with 320 million people strong we could make 98 percent of all the clothes we bring into this
[01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:57.840]  country is manufactured overseas that you and people say well you can't do manufacturing oh yeah
[01:54:57.840 --> 01:55:04.640]  i think there's this country called germany and about 25 percent of their gdp or their abouts
[01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:11.840]  is from manufacturing and only 11 12 percent in the united states oh they can do it we can't
[01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:19.680]  oh and those manufacturing jobs pay so much higher wages so what i'm saying is that everybody
[01:55:19.680 --> 01:55:25.680]  out there that wants to take your life into your own hands if you believe you have the skills in
[01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:30.640]  the products now is the time and gerald what you're saying is so powerful what you're saying so
[01:55:30.640 --> 01:55:35.680]  powerful forget trump whether he delivers or not we can deliver with the whole message gerald's been
[01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:40.800]  preaching forever that's pure americana and gerald's been preaching it for 20 plus years we're going
[01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:45.600]  back to gerald and a few of your calls from andrew jeremy trevor jesse justin and others

[01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:17.760]  use this like thing with russia to like start like a war and like get in martial law or just kind of
[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:22.800]  like a hostage taker pointing a gun at their own head and be like oh shoot well sure i mean
[01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:26.480]  that's a great question i mean don't you think that's what the russians think that's what everybody
[01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:31.120]  else thinks that this whole assassination of the russian ambassador is trying to stir up something
[01:57:31.120 --> 01:57:38.240]  in the last 30 days with russia okay well it is and but people that are concerned about a coup
[01:57:38.240 --> 01:57:44.080]  we talked about the people that trump brought in on the economic end how about all the generals he
[01:57:44.080 --> 01:57:51.360]  brought in i think that they're planning ahead of time and being a proactive in his choices
[01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:59.360]  just in case they try to do something to disrupt him being getting into office
[01:57:59.360 --> 01:58:04.000]  or trying to get him out this isn't boasting i'm gonna just tell the you know the fake left and

[02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:55.840]  more calls here let's talk to jeremy in texas uh what do you think's coming next is a distraction
[02:00:55.840 --> 02:01:02.000]  or a way to try to derail trump alex i think ultimately the federal reserve is going to dump
[02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:10.480]  the dollar i believe the recent dbs o db os attack on info wars was a shot heard around the world
[02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:16.960]  and is a warning shot to warn everybody that we can in effect shut down the american grid with
[02:01:16.960 --> 02:01:26.720]  the db os attack uh that's that's what i'm thinking in a nutshell and uh it really comes down to uh
[02:01:26.720 --> 02:01:33.200]  the economic power shifting i believe that the elite want to bring order of chaos naturally so
[02:01:33.200 --> 02:01:39.360]  they lost total control and they want to hedge everything on chaos in fact uh the fema nasa
[02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:44.720]  have been meeting recently in southern california over potential asteroid strikes oh they're saying
[02:01:44.720 --> 02:01:49.840]  a huge earthquakes wherever we're doing california it's everywhere on the great uh ring of fire except
[02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:54.080]  there and it's supposed to be like an eight or a seven point eight next time it hits it's estimated
[02:01:54.080 --> 02:01:59.600]  but but you know you're right they're betting everything on chaos but the momentum is against
[02:01:59.600 --> 02:02:05.920]  them uh i appreciate your call by the way folks info wars is you know in the top hundred websites
[02:02:05.920 --> 02:02:09.840]  in the world the issue is we have the biggest one of the biggest companies in the world does
[02:02:09.840 --> 02:02:15.200]  mastercard visa you name it they said don't worry we flipped on systems that you know state
[02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:19.520]  sponsors will have trouble bringing down well they brought it down again so it was sophisticated
[02:02:19.520 --> 02:02:25.360]  massive quadruple pronged and went over four days and it's and i'm sure i'll hit it again uh gerald
[02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:32.960]  salante yes i and i want to urge everybody listening to you know support info wars by the
[02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:37.280]  products that they're selling they're made in america they're made with quality and pride
[02:02:37.840 --> 02:02:44.560]  and the major media is doing everything they can to sell this lie of fake news when they are the
[02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:51.440]  greatest purveyors of it so really put your money where your mind is and make this happen because
[02:02:51.440 --> 02:02:59.440]  now is our time and as someone once said it does not take a majority to prevail but rather an irate
[02:02:59.440 --> 02:03:06.800]  tireless minority keen on setting brush fires of freedom in the minds of men samuel adams so
[02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:12.960]  everyone out there do what you can to make all this happen because you know the negatives are there
[02:03:12.960 --> 02:03:18.800]  you know eliminate them let's hit the positives and the positives are we the people and now it's
[02:03:18.800 --> 02:03:24.320]  never been a better time as for the dollar i think it's going to continue to get stronger
[02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:28.640]  you look at the you want they have a this is where i disagree with trump by the way
[02:03:28.640 --> 02:03:34.080]  the chinese are not devaluing their currency you're doing everything they can trying to prop it up
[02:03:34.080 --> 02:03:39.200]  they just had 70 billion dollars worth of outflows well i mean i agree but it's still a paradox is
[02:03:39.200 --> 02:03:43.920]  when it goes low it still hurts our manufacturing but they've so overprinted that it's it's kind of a
[02:03:43.920 --> 02:03:47.120]  it means damn if you damn if you don't but i think you're right i real quick trevor and
[02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:50.960]  loaning i know this is a question you don't want uh what's your question or comment for gel salenta
[02:03:50.960 --> 02:03:58.400]  go ahead trevor um it would be about china uh stockpiling silver and gold over the past decade uh
[02:03:58.400 --> 02:04:08.960]  and to that same uh line of thinking is uh if they do crash global markets will they then go to the
[02:04:08.960 --> 02:04:14.800]  gold or silverback currency that being that china and india have been buying it up that they're
[02:04:14.800 --> 02:04:21.600]  ultimately going to hold the lion's share and uh we're almost out of time started to get you guys
[02:04:21.600 --> 02:04:26.560]  in short real quick gerald answer to that yeah well again china's reserve currencies are down 20
[02:04:26.560 --> 02:04:32.720]  percent the people are buying gold they've driven bitcoin up 34 percent so you go to where there's
[02:04:32.720 --> 02:04:38.640]  india china they all want gold but the governments are trying to stop them from buying it because
[02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:44.160]  they know how worthless their currencies are but regardless they'll be ups and downs but the long
[02:04:44.160 --> 02:04:50.320]  term we still see gold is a safe haven and china and india is the biggest buyer uh it's a definitely
[02:04:50.320 --> 02:04:54.880]  an interesting time because the chinese problem thank you gel salenta friends research dot com
[02:04:54.880 --> 02:05:02.080]  stay with us roger stone straight ahead despite all the status rhetoric that gun control works
[02:05:02.080 --> 02:05:06.480]  here's five reasons why it won't number one california has many of the most restrictive gun
[02:05:06.480 --> 02:05:11.200]  laws in the country yet those laws did absolutely nothing to stop the san Bernardino shooting
[02:05:11.200 --> 02:05:15.440]  number two paris france also has some of the most restrictive gun laws in the world but those laws
[02:05:15.440 --> 02:05:20.400]  also did nothing to stop the november 13th isis attacks number three it's estimated that someone
[02:05:20.400 --> 02:05:26.640]  in chicago is shot every 2.8 hours despite the city's strict gun laws number four mexico also
[02:05:26.640 --> 02:05:31.520]  has restrictive gun laws just like chicago yet over 160 000 people have been murdered in the
[02:05:31.520 --> 02:05:36.400]  country's drug war since 2007 the only people who are actually stopping the mexican cartels
[02:05:36.400 --> 02:05:41.600]  are private citizens who are openly defying mexico's gun laws to form self-defense malicious
[02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:46.880]  number five president obama has been arming and funding isis link sarian rebels for quite some time
[02:05:46.880 --> 02:05:51.840]  in fact obama approved the re-arming of the so-called moderate rebels on october 1st the same
[02:05:51.840 --> 02:05:56.080]  day he called for gun control in response to the community college shooting up in oregon you can

[02:08:27.120 --> 02:08:30.960]  yeah you should be a really nice guy they got a hold of me you know what i don't care anymore
[02:08:32.240 --> 02:08:36.000]  i got lots of friends because they read the newspapers and the newspapers are the enemy
[02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:43.040]  so the newspapers are attacking me i must be a good guy that's how little power the establishment
[02:08:43.040 --> 02:08:48.320]  has the only power they have is to endorse you and then the public will turn against you
[02:08:48.880 --> 02:08:53.680]  donald trump has learned that we've all learned that we've seen the entire media establishment
[02:08:53.680 --> 02:08:58.240]  do everything they could to defeat trump to lie about him to call him racist a homophobe then a
[02:08:58.240 --> 02:09:08.560]  russian agent a rapist all of it fake and now he got the 270 well past at 300 plus with the
[02:09:08.560 --> 02:09:16.000]  electors yesterday were 30 days out from the january 20th friday event that'll happen in dc
[02:09:16.640 --> 02:09:23.840]  and my question is what will they try to pull now or what to look for now from the man roger
[02:09:23.840 --> 02:09:28.560]  stone former head of the trump campaign and obviously uh good friends with trump former
[02:09:28.560 --> 02:09:34.480]  wingman of trump uh who never tells anything trump told us just uh tells us what we should look for
[02:09:34.480 --> 02:09:40.960]  uh coming up in the future so uh he's with us for one segment he's been upriding uh he's a
[02:09:40.960 --> 02:09:45.680]  little bit under the weather uh but he's here to celebrate with a victory lap the fact that we
[02:09:45.680 --> 02:09:52.000]  got the election and now he's gotten the delegates and all the sabotage failed so congratulations
[02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:57.760]  roger stone and also to all the listeners for taking action we're the winners in the uphill
[02:09:57.760 --> 02:10:05.840]  battle in the election of the century alex um it's great to be with you today i got a little
[02:10:05.840 --> 02:10:11.920]  bout of uh food poisoning but um delighted to say that i have a rallyed as you know i'm
[02:10:11.920 --> 02:10:16.560]  kind of hunkered down trying to finish the manuscript for my book the making of the president
[02:10:16.560 --> 02:10:24.320]  2016 how donald trump orchestrated an american revolution uh but you're exactly right the coup
[02:10:24.320 --> 02:10:32.480]  d'etat has fizzled all that sermon drying about the electors and the the uh the harping on the
[02:10:32.480 --> 02:10:42.400]  popular vote then the completely phony 3.5 million dollar recount in wisconsin which produced nothing
[02:10:42.400 --> 02:10:49.200]  but a slight gain for donald trump and then there was this assault on the electors electors threatened
[02:10:49.200 --> 02:10:55.440]  with murder threatened with violence threatened to be destroyed and they picked up one electorate
[02:10:55.440 --> 02:11:03.920]  so the score is um i would say david brock is now zero for two and if i were george soros
[02:11:04.480 --> 02:11:11.520]  and i had laid out 300 400 million dollars i would want my money back you know i don't normally
[02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:16.000]  make fun of people's appearances but he looks like some kind of weird poodle dog or something
[02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:21.520]  with that fake einstein hair he just looks like the biggest phony intellectual dumbass
[02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:27.360]  the world has ever seen this is the supposed brainiac i mean the guy's a complete joke he
[02:11:27.360 --> 02:11:33.120]  thought demonizing trump with alex jones would make people turn against trump when all it did
[02:11:33.120 --> 02:11:41.840]  was give trump that that allure of true revolutionary sexiness yeah it was an entire miscalculation
[02:11:41.840 --> 02:11:47.280]  somehow the idea that if you smeared roger stone if you smeared alex jones if you smeared the other
[02:11:47.280 --> 02:11:53.920]  so-called deplorables um that that would elect hillary clinton and erase her various warts and
[02:11:53.920 --> 02:11:59.680]  blemishes which are obviously quite substantial and they thought kicking you in their internal
[02:11:59.680 --> 02:12:05.760]  memos and video that we've caught the mvp off fox seeing an msnbc officially banned the last year
[02:12:05.760 --> 02:12:11.760]  and a half that only made you focus on the new media more and made you even bigger so so it's
[02:12:11.760 --> 02:12:17.120]  so funny they thought they took you out of the game well on the irony here now alex is it we're
[02:12:17.120 --> 02:12:23.200]  fighting over so-called fake news because i've been subjected to fake news three times in the last
[02:12:23.200 --> 02:12:30.480]  week first john pedesta wrote in the washington post that i tipped donald trump off to russian
[02:12:30.480 --> 02:12:39.120]  hacking by wiki leaks a total and complete falsehood uh then the white house press secretary
[02:12:39.120 --> 02:12:46.000]  attacked me by name suggesting yet again that i told donald trump in advance of some
[02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:51.520]  russian hacking that's twice and now frankly with some fulfillment
[02:12:52.320 --> 02:13:00.080]  politically facts comes forward and they admit yesterday no evidence whatsoever of russian hacking
[02:13:00.080 --> 02:13:06.960]  now that's the fake news we are the real news which is why i urge people to go to info war site
[02:13:06.960 --> 02:13:14.880]  and sign the petition now uh to make sure the president understands we don't need a civilian
[02:13:14.880 --> 02:13:23.280]  censorship board secretly run by the cia to decide what is and is not real news and by the way i need
[02:13:23.280 --> 02:13:28.640]  to call bannon and people have been too busy we've mailed the uh hundred thousand signatures that
[02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:34.160]  we printed up so that they physically see them uh to trump tower so hope that isn't taken as a giant
[02:13:34.160 --> 02:13:37.840]  you know what the punch bowl but obviously trump wants to support the free speech and and the
[02:13:37.840 --> 02:13:42.320]  independent media that helped get him elected we're also going to then mail it on to congress uh
[02:13:42.320 --> 02:13:46.720]  and onto the congress folks obviously is a stunt to show what's happened but people can sign the
[02:13:46.720 --> 02:13:50.400]  next way with the petition that we're going to deliver as well at info wars dot com forward slash
[02:13:50.400 --> 02:13:55.840]  newsletter there's the main newsletter then there's also the free speech coalition we found it but
[02:13:55.840 --> 02:14:00.720]  wow so so so they graduated from getting caught lying and having no credibility to openly wanting
[02:14:00.720 --> 02:14:05.760]  to shut us up and even matt tiebe the rolling stone said this is worse than mccarthy i mean
[02:14:05.760 --> 02:14:11.440]  these people are crazy how do you expect this to play out roger yeah no alex is exactly right this
[02:14:11.440 --> 02:14:18.720]  is the new mccarthyism in other words if you are not for war uh over syria presumably with the russians
[02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:26.000]  then you must be a trader to the country uh that you love you must be a spy for putin uh it's ironic
[02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:32.800]  is it not that their whole meme was exactly the same before the election as it is after the election
[02:14:33.360 --> 02:14:39.360]  you can go to look at back-to-back washington post analysis pieces before the election
[02:14:40.080 --> 02:14:46.480]  podesta says stone is a soviet spy after the election he essentially says stone is a soviet
[02:14:46.480 --> 02:14:52.480]  spy it was a lie then it's a lie now a great part though no one buys it it's a huge joke
[02:14:52.480 --> 02:14:57.840]  all of the internet the memes are incredible no one buys it no one no one though is worse
[02:14:58.880 --> 02:15:05.440]  than john brennan the cia director first of all i believe that he is a islamic sympathizer
[02:15:05.440 --> 02:15:11.760]  i think that uh that he has been a great proponent of the muslim brotherhood he refused to use a
[02:15:11.760 --> 02:15:19.200]  bible to be sworn in to his august office uh many people in intelligence believe that he has himself
[02:15:19.200 --> 02:15:25.120]  converted to ahabism by the way he was also predicting that the russians would hack the
[02:15:25.120 --> 02:15:31.440]  election before the election now he's saying it again that's because clapper and these others
[02:15:31.440 --> 02:15:37.120]  dr james clapper who runs defense intelligence pointed out that the cia had no evidence that's
[02:15:37.120 --> 02:15:43.440]  why brennan had to jump back in and said oh yes we do but he doesn't he needs to go the instant
[02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:50.160]  donald trump is elected he needs to go well absolutely he is going to be gone gone gone
[02:15:50.160 --> 02:15:55.520]  in the time we have i want you to rest and get back to the book but looking at this obviously what
[02:15:55.520 --> 02:16:01.120]  well what else do you think some potuses 45s radar screen what are other big issues we've
[02:16:01.120 --> 02:16:06.160]  got to look out for as far as appointments other dirty tricks you think they might pull to keep
[02:16:06.160 --> 02:16:10.880]  him from getting in there obviously they're going to want a bunch of hysteria uh at the
[02:16:10.880 --> 02:16:16.480]  inauguration but it seems like american people as his poll numbers only go up get now how pathetic
[02:16:16.480 --> 02:16:24.320]  all this is well two things alex won a major story in new york magazine on the case for impeachment
[02:16:24.320 --> 02:16:29.120]  of donald trump now i guess that this is an admission that they're not going to stop his
[02:16:29.120 --> 02:16:36.880]  being sworn in so therefore the drum beat for impeachment over some imagined or manufactured
[02:16:36.880 --> 02:16:47.600]  ethical issues uh appears to me to be a foil we also now have a claim uh of uh trump saying
[02:16:47.600 --> 02:16:52.960]  racially inappropriate things prior to an apprentice taping let's wait and see if there
[02:16:52.960 --> 02:17:00.240]  really is a tape we heard this canard before during the election but they're going to continue
[02:17:00.240 --> 02:17:06.320]  to try to delegitimize trump in any way possible sure and it's not vindictiveness he's got to go
[02:17:06.320 --> 02:17:09.840]  on the offense against the clinton's and all the people that really got money from russia
[02:17:09.840 --> 02:17:13.120]  are they're never going to stop i mean the thing is he can't just be nice they're not going to go
[02:17:13.120 --> 02:17:21.440]  away well plus at the same time we have our internal battles so i read a piece that astounded
[02:17:21.440 --> 02:17:28.160]  me in newsmax the other day that the chairman of the council on foreign relations richard haas was
[02:17:28.160 --> 02:17:34.080]  destined to be the number two man at the trump state department let me just say for the record
[02:17:34.080 --> 02:17:41.360]  don't bet the ranch and you've said that about romney as well i know you just imagined it yourself
[02:17:42.160 --> 02:17:46.400]  trump was never toying with him with like a cat with a mouth i love the photo of him at
[02:17:46.400 --> 02:17:51.040]  trump tower though having dinner with previs and romney and he looks like the cat that just ate
[02:17:51.040 --> 02:17:57.600]  the canary that a very catlike face on trump i just elix i have an instinctual belief that
[02:17:57.600 --> 02:18:02.960]  richard haas is not going to get this job and that don trump is not going to elevate the head of
[02:18:02.960 --> 02:18:11.280]  the cfr to anything you know when i spoke to him last i can divulge this i said to him you've got
[02:18:11.280 --> 02:18:17.280]  an awful lot of guys from golden and sax and he said yeah you know why they're really really smart
[02:18:17.280 --> 02:18:22.400]  guys but if anybody doesn't think i'm making policy and they're carrying it out they don't
[02:18:22.400 --> 02:18:29.360]  understand why i hired them so are you breaking out here that is major news yeah this is uh he's
[02:18:29.360 --> 02:18:35.520]  in charge here there's no question about it and he is seeking out extraordinarily capable people
[02:18:35.520 --> 02:18:41.440]  nobody ever said the guys at goldman are dumb they had made billions for your clients trillions
[02:18:42.320 --> 02:18:47.440]  i mean over the last hundred years very clearly trumps let's let's let's add to this you know i i
[02:18:47.440 --> 02:18:51.280]  gave the analogy in the media made jokes about it saying alice shones is worried about trump and
[02:18:51.280 --> 02:18:55.680]  goblins no i said let's say he's the lord of the rings and he's got to go into a goblins nest
[02:18:55.680 --> 02:19:00.960]  there's a kind of a goblin aid like golem that's going to lead him in it it doesn't mean that he
[02:19:00.960 --> 02:19:05.520]  gets in bed with a goblin doesn't mean he marries a goblin or has babies with goblins he's going to
[02:19:05.520 --> 02:19:10.560]  have to have some rents prebuses golem like creatures and other goblin like creatures
[02:19:10.560 --> 02:19:15.600]  that are from mordor they're going to lead him around and show him how to get stuff done where
[02:19:15.600 --> 02:19:20.720]  the keys are where the torches are you know how to get stuff done and and so that's what we see and
[02:19:20.720 --> 02:19:27.520]  we see him now delivering on his agenda and bringing in outsiders like rex tellison who is from the
[02:19:27.520 --> 02:19:32.480]  corporate world getting stuff done from the real world not the fictional world and that's really
[02:19:32.480 --> 02:19:38.720]  scaring the power structure no i think trump is intent on recruiting men and women whose focus
[02:19:38.720 --> 02:19:45.520]  has been making a profit for their business or for their customers someone who is bottom line
[02:19:45.520 --> 02:19:50.880]  oriented because of course no one in government cares about the bottom line ever let's expand on this
[02:19:50.880 --> 02:19:55.440]  in a few minutes we have left with roger stone who is writing his his epic book i've already ordered
[02:19:55.440 --> 02:19:58.880]  10 000 of them that's how big i think this book's going to be ladies and gentlemen we normally order
[02:19:58.880 --> 02:20:04.000]  like 500 of a book okay uh so this is going to be huge believe me i've already been able to see some
[02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:07.440]  of it it's it's going to be total inside baseball stuff you're not going to learn anywhere else
[02:20:07.440 --> 02:20:12.400]  and he's only finishing the next week or so she'll get right up until now now obviously you've talked
[02:20:12.400 --> 02:20:18.080]  quite a bit to potas and i'll just leave it at that uh or president elect 45 what else can you
[02:20:18.080 --> 02:20:23.280]  impart the focus that's i have vice here they've asked me twice what about golden sacks what about
[02:20:23.280 --> 02:20:28.240]  golden sacks you say golden sacks is bad i say wait i have no me prince on was a foreign managing
[02:20:28.240 --> 02:20:33.760]  director she exposes the globalist they get the brightest people it's the biggest brokerage bank
[02:20:33.760 --> 02:20:39.920]  you know state loaning bank in the world obviously they've got the good the bad the ugly i don't like
[02:20:39.920 --> 02:20:46.160]  the heads of it uh you know like corezine and others giving the gun control giving the carbon
[02:20:46.160 --> 02:20:52.000]  taxes i'd love to have trump make them reform themselves which the president could do obviously
[02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:57.280]  you're gonna get the top banking people that's who you get to then make them carry out his will
[02:20:57.280 --> 02:21:02.080]  to make america great again now if i see gun controller globalism then i'm gonna go completely
[02:21:02.080 --> 02:21:07.360]  crazy but so far we don't and you just you haven't even told me that and that's amazing this new info
[02:21:07.360 --> 02:21:12.800]  that he explained himself on that saying they're gonna do my will they're gonna carry out my agenda
[02:21:12.800 --> 02:21:18.800]  so so please elaborate well trump has throughout his entire career uh been a very good judge of
[02:21:18.800 --> 02:21:24.400]  character and selected exemplary people to work for him uh and then he backs them up and gives them
[02:21:24.400 --> 02:21:29.280]  their head this is this is the way he's always operated in business and it's worked very well
[02:21:29.280 --> 02:21:34.880]  for him at the same time making it clear that the agenda is his that the objectives are his
[02:21:34.880 --> 02:21:42.160]  uh and i think that's exactly what we have here uh meanwhile he is uh now in palm beach
[02:21:43.040 --> 02:21:49.600]  playing a little golf getting some well-deserved r and r but still working every day uh he is
[02:21:49.600 --> 02:21:54.880]  i think was really pumped up about his trip to alabama and the terrific outpouring there
[02:21:56.080 --> 02:22:01.040]  we are looking at the inaugural with some excitement you know i don't know if you know
[02:22:01.040 --> 02:22:08.880]  this alex but the deplorable which was originally scheduled for the clearendon ballroom in roslyn
[02:22:08.880 --> 02:22:15.040]  virginia it got canceled and they would have copies of the fact it has now been resurrected at the
[02:22:15.040 --> 02:22:21.280]  at the national press club a larger and better venue uh we can accommodate a thousand people
[02:22:21.840 --> 02:22:27.920]  i will definitely be there alex i'm inviting you uh this is where the patriots i know i wasn't
[02:22:27.920 --> 02:22:33.760]  gonna go i kind of decided a week ago not to go just because it's just i like to be in texas i
[02:22:33.760 --> 02:22:37.760]  like to be separate from dc but i think i've got to go to the deplorable i know i've been invited
[02:22:37.760 --> 02:22:41.520]  to some other obviously big functions but my place would be out there in the crowds battling
[02:22:41.520 --> 02:22:44.800]  the communists but i got to be honest with you i get sick of battling the communists you know what
[02:22:44.800 --> 02:22:51.680]  i mean well there's something to be said for you know uh camaraderie with your fellow patriots
[02:22:52.320 --> 02:22:56.240]  because i don't know i absolutely and there are some lovely patriots as well
[02:22:56.240 --> 02:23:01.760]  and those who've been in the vanguard of the trump campaign will be at the deplorable because
[02:23:01.760 --> 02:23:07.360]  we can't afford the twenty five thousand dollars a ticket events for the inaugural committee so
[02:23:07.360 --> 02:23:12.160]  this is really the people's inaugural event uh and if we're fortunate some members of the
[02:23:12.160 --> 02:23:16.880]  trump family may drop by so i really urge you to make it i'm gonna be there roger and i'm gonna
[02:23:16.880 --> 02:23:23.280]  be there but i was i was gonna try to leave folks in suspense but i i just can't miss it uh now
[02:23:23.280 --> 02:23:27.280]  i'm gonna let you go i appreciate your time get some rest i mean i know you're texting me at four

[02:23:38.160 --> 02:23:44.960]  got to do some editing with an idea to get it out the door by january first uh realistically would
[02:23:44.960 --> 02:23:50.000]  like to make it for the inauguration that's what it's currently scheduled still shooting for that
[02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:57.120]  but um remains to be seen i just would like to be first this book will be historic you're gonna
[02:23:57.120 --> 02:24:03.920]  learn things you cannot learn anywhere else about what really happened here uh and this book will be
[02:24:03.920 --> 02:24:09.360]  popular with some people and not so popular with others i don't want to mention any names
[02:24:09.360 --> 02:24:15.280]  john pedesta but there are people who aren't gonna like this book ted cruise and then there's some

[02:27:32.640 --> 02:27:37.760]  and again my friends we're under attack you know a lot of folks would bitch and complain about it
[02:27:37.760 --> 02:27:42.560]  i'm very proud of the fact we have the entire state-run media attacking us foreign media
[02:27:42.560 --> 02:27:47.440]  attacking us the EU saying shut us down and block us the communist chinese attacking us
[02:27:47.440 --> 02:27:53.200]  i mean this is epic this is legendary we've gone from being huge to just gigantic or in our footprint
[02:27:53.200 --> 02:27:58.480]  of resistance we're still a tiny organization the amount of funding we bring in for an organization
[02:27:58.480 --> 02:28:05.360]  this powerful is is is is small we're huge successes at reaching people gigantic failures
[02:28:05.360 --> 02:28:12.560]  at raising capital but we're still kings of raising capital in a system where the big
[02:28:12.560 --> 02:28:18.160]  corporations don't give sponsorship to anybody that supports freedom that supports justice
[02:28:18.160 --> 02:28:24.800]  that supports sovereignty and who isn't quite frankly evil so we direct sale products to you
[02:28:25.520 --> 02:28:30.640]  because we couldn't expand just off the small sponsors we had i'm also very picky about sponsors
[02:28:31.600 --> 02:28:36.800]  so again we've been direct selling videos books things you know that i've produced and written
[02:28:37.440 --> 02:28:42.000]  for 20 years but i've moved into other great products and things and we've we've really created
[02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:46.240]  a model here that everybody else is trying to copy and i'm not bragging that's the most
[02:28:46.240 --> 02:28:53.760]  sincere form of flattery i was on a national private russian libertarian tv that's on all
[02:28:53.760 --> 02:28:58.800]  over russia with 40 million viewers a day today for an hour and they and i was realizing when
[02:28:58.800 --> 02:29:03.360]  i was on the show there was like famous russians were on the show like advisors to putin you name
[02:29:03.360 --> 02:29:09.040]  it and i was sitting there going oh yeah i know these guys and they were there thanking me for the
[02:29:09.040 --> 02:29:14.000]  model and thanking me for you know changing the world paradigm and it wasn't about my ego
[02:29:14.560 --> 02:29:19.840]  but it was surreal to go i'd better do a better job because see i hate people thanking me because
[02:29:19.840 --> 02:29:24.880]  i'm sitting here thinking how i stumble how i jibber how i get obnoxious how i but people see
[02:29:24.880 --> 02:29:31.600]  the sincerity and for whatever reason we're kicking butt globally this message 1776 worldwide
[02:29:31.600 --> 02:29:36.240]  isn't about america and some conquest of other countries it's about an idea of the renaissance
[02:29:36.240 --> 02:29:42.080]  that came out of america going global to defeat collectivism say what you want about america
[02:29:42.080 --> 02:29:47.440]  we are the kings of free market renaissance in our heyday we want to bring that back because
[02:29:47.440 --> 02:29:55.280]  it's back to the future we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio
[02:29:55.280 --> 02:30:04.160]  network the constitutional convention 1787 was held strict secrecy and at the end of the
[02:30:04.160 --> 02:30:08.160]  preceding citizens gathered outside independence halter learned what had been produced behind
[02:30:08.160 --> 02:30:12.960]  closed doors albijou and franklin was leaving the hall a lady asked him well doctor what have we
[02:30:12.960 --> 02:30:18.880]  got a republic or a monarchy to which he responded a republic if you can keep it but today not only
[02:30:18.880 --> 02:30:23.840]  have we lost a republic but most people don't even know what a republic even is for one thing a republic
[02:30:23.840 --> 02:30:28.480]  is not a democracy the republic operates under the rule of law which protects individual liberties
[02:30:28.480 --> 02:30:32.480]  so that the majority cannot take away the rights of the minority under republic the government
[02:30:32.480 --> 02:30:36.800]  and its citizens all abide by the same laws regardless of political power or lack thereof
[02:30:36.800 --> 02:30:41.120]  democracy on the other hand only leads to mob rule fueled by the unrestrained whims of the public
[02:30:41.120 --> 02:30:45.920]  in a democracy the individual or any groups of individuals composing the minority have no protection
[02:30:45.920 --> 02:30:50.640]  against the unlimited power of the majority it is a case of majority over man in other words under
[02:30:50.640 --> 02:30:55.120]  democracy two wolves can vote to eat the sheep for dinner but under a republic the sheep's right to
[02:30:55.120 --> 02:31:02.560]  life is protected by the rule of law this is kit daniels with info wars dot com more than two years ago info wars first told you

[02:33:32.800 --> 02:33:38.800]  says member of their parliament says they're under islamic attack but we see the leading
[02:33:38.800 --> 02:33:44.480]  candidate in the polls for the new president or prime minister of the netherlands being being
[02:33:44.480 --> 02:33:49.920]  convicted what was it two weeks ago grit wilders for simply saying bringing in these marocans and
[02:33:49.920 --> 02:33:56.480]  people the crime rates going up they've ordered in the netherlands in sweden and in deutschland
[02:33:57.520 --> 02:34:05.120]  to cover up crime statistics that almost all rapes are by the islamists because in their culture
[02:34:05.760 --> 02:34:10.160]  if a woman's not covered up their fair game then if you rape her she goes to prison
[02:34:12.160 --> 02:34:18.000]  again this is everything that matt bracken has predicted if you go to info wars dot com
[02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:22.080]  we have paul watson's boil down and break down of this now notice first they said it was just a

[02:34:27.760 --> 02:34:32.560]  we had 80 something dead and niece and hundreds injured they tried to cover that up as well
[02:34:32.560 --> 02:34:37.520]  like san bernadino shooting people in front of the christmas tree the husband and wife the fbi
[02:34:37.520 --> 02:34:42.240]  knew was ordered to stand down two years before they were going to the middle east going to
[02:34:42.240 --> 02:34:48.000]  saudi arabia going to pakistan for training it's incredible you go to pakistan for training you're

[02:35:29.360 --> 02:35:35.520]  racist so seeing and call the act of care a truck crash again yesterday that was going on
[02:35:35.520 --> 02:35:40.400]  one berlin truck attacker identified a 23-year-old pakistani refugee they found with blood all over
[02:35:40.400 --> 02:35:44.080]  him but now they say they don't think it's him and released him because i guess it bring down
[02:35:44.080 --> 02:35:47.680]  murkel so they're just there'll be a catch and release thing now i mean i'm not saying he's 100

[02:35:52.320 --> 02:35:57.200]  said pulled out of the truck but you know what i'm sure the truck's megatron it did it on its own
[02:35:57.200 --> 02:36:05.440]  how low can you go ukrainian p.m. calls russian ambassadors murder a hero that's who soros is
[02:36:05.440 --> 02:36:10.800]  installed in the ukraine cnn again responds to islamic terror attack in merlin by blaming

[02:36:31.200 --> 02:36:38.800]  is the enemy media murkel's open door policy blame for berlin truck attack german state minister
[02:36:38.800 --> 02:36:44.400]  we're in a state of war the chairman of the german state of sarland shed tuesday germany is in a state
[02:36:44.400 --> 02:36:48.640]  of war after a man drove a truck do a crowd in berlin christmas market killing 12 people and
[02:36:48.640 --> 02:36:54.400]  injuring 48 and suspected terrorist attack beautiful carols beautiful lights beautiful trees a cultural
[02:36:54.400 --> 02:37:01.920]  event running over people and oh my gosh the left obama came out after the ohio attack and said don't
[02:37:01.920 --> 02:37:06.240]  blame islam you don't blame us a molly who was here illegally who pledged allegiance to al-qaeda
[02:37:06.240 --> 02:37:12.640]  and isis why do they hate us so much why is the left allied with them and now that trump got the
[02:37:12.640 --> 02:37:19.280]  electors 303 sd of 270 needed more people went against hillary than went against him notice
[02:37:19.280 --> 02:37:25.040]  out backfired another repudiation of these people they don't care i don't think they're going away i
[02:37:25.040 --> 02:37:29.840]  think they're gonna plan something else let's get matt bracken's take on all this former navy seal
[02:37:29.840 --> 02:37:34.080]  best-selling author who i didn't even know about till about a year and a half ago who got highly
[02:37:34.080 --> 02:37:38.240]  recommended by some of my pentagon sources and by the way i could pick the phone up and call current
[02:37:38.240 --> 02:37:43.360]  high-level cia current pentagon i could pick up the phone and i'm not gonna brag here the media
[02:37:43.360 --> 02:37:49.360]  goes crazy with it everybody knows who i could talk to who i do talk to okay and let's just say
[02:37:49.360 --> 02:37:53.840]  the reason they talk to me is because they know who i talked to and i've just been basically told
[02:37:53.840 --> 02:37:57.760]  that i've been adopted as a mouthpiece of what's really going on i'm not told what to say i know
[02:37:57.760 --> 02:38:03.520]  what's going on okay i'm not bragging i'm telling the listeners you need to understand the good news
[02:38:03.520 --> 02:38:09.520]  is we'd already been marshal law that wasn't for about 90 of the military being awake and trump
[02:38:09.520 --> 02:38:14.320]  you know to put all these generals in knowing they're planning a coup once he gets in her before
[02:38:14.320 --> 02:38:18.960]  so people are saying oh you're gonna back fascism by trump well if they try to blow up the white
[02:38:18.960 --> 02:38:23.680]  house or something and he arrests a bunch of people that's not fascism we have the tyranny in our
[02:38:23.680 --> 02:38:28.640]  country we're going to have to remove it i don't want to arrest thousands of these people but they're
[02:38:28.640 --> 02:38:33.840]  seditious they're not gonna stop they're calling for killing the president elect i say arrest every
[02:38:33.840 --> 02:38:38.320]  damn one of them and charge them if i called for killing the president they'd arrest me and they
[02:38:38.320 --> 02:38:43.440]  should matt brakin i mean people need to understand from my view we're in the middle of a civil war
[02:38:43.440 --> 02:38:49.520]  still what do you say definitely and it's a dangerous time that we we did um hold off their
[02:38:49.520 --> 02:38:55.120]  electoral coup it even blew back when hillary where she lost more electoral votes than trump did
[02:38:55.760 --> 02:39:01.440]  but uh they won't give up they never quit you know this is a this is the red green alliance this is
[02:39:01.440 --> 02:39:07.840]  islam and the left the light against civilization we see it starkly in germany even now you know
[02:39:07.840 --> 02:39:14.720]  the they are afraid to name what it is which is islamic terror something that all muslims need
[02:39:14.720 --> 02:39:20.960]  to know all the quote unquote moderate muslims people aren't stupid even though the mainstream
[02:39:20.960 --> 02:39:27.200]  media portrayals might make it sound like we're blind and stupid we understand there's no protesting
[02:39:27.200 --> 02:39:32.640]  going on millions come out to protest against muhammad cartoons they don't come out to protest
[02:39:32.640 --> 02:39:37.440]  against slaughter in the streets and that the way that i look at it the only difference between
[02:39:37.440 --> 02:39:44.160]  the moderate muslims and the radical muslims is that the moderate muslims are just demographically
[02:39:44.160 --> 02:39:51.120]  planning to take over as the radicals you know are sort of the bad cop in a ongoing good cop
[02:39:51.120 --> 02:39:56.400]  bad cop routine the bad cops are blowing up buildings or you know driving over people with
[02:39:56.400 --> 02:40:03.040]  trucks and then we're told don't make the good muslims mad just give them a little bit more
[02:40:03.040 --> 02:40:07.200]  so what we're seeing now is the extinguishing of christianity in europe you think they're
[02:40:07.200 --> 02:40:11.600]  going to be these christmas festivals in europe outside anymore and notice the leftists them
[02:40:11.600 --> 02:40:16.560]  are all trying to sue and ban christmas trees they say don't even hand out christmas cards which
[02:40:16.560 --> 02:40:20.960]  is your first amendment they're now saying don't even use holiday in the colleges the left is
[02:40:20.960 --> 02:40:26.560]  synced up trying to extinct christianity well this is and and this is the meaning of islam it's
[02:40:26.560 --> 02:40:33.680]  not peace it's submission islam means submission you'll get peace theoretically after the entire
[02:40:33.680 --> 02:40:39.360]  world has submitted to islam which i don't plan to do uh you know the other attack though i would
[02:40:39.360 --> 02:40:44.800]  like to mention a minute the other attack in anchor of the policeman in you know well in his suit
[02:40:45.440 --> 02:40:51.280]  with his id and his you know service pistol i think that's got the elites way more freaked out than
[02:40:52.080 --> 02:40:56.800]  than what happened at uh the christmas fair in berlin well for russia thinks it's a false
[02:40:56.800 --> 02:41:00.800]  flag to try to and in my word from a little pentagon source last week and i went with it on
[02:41:00.800 --> 02:41:05.760]  air is they're gonna try to escalate the syria thing before obama leaves uh and that really
[02:41:05.760 --> 02:41:10.320]  try to start a bombing war against russia they're hoping they retaliate the word is and russia said
[02:41:10.320 --> 02:41:16.160]  this they're gonna lay back and wait till trump gets in uh what's your intel well i i would i just
[02:41:16.160 --> 02:41:19.840]  want to continue on this thought about this assassin that's up on the screen right now
[02:41:20.880 --> 02:41:25.200]  when when the elites are worried they're not worried about us getting run over in streets
[02:41:25.200 --> 02:41:30.400]  or blown up in a cafe they could care less we're the peasants we're outside of the green zone
[02:41:30.400 --> 02:41:36.080]  you know we're living out in the hinterland in the uh you know west world um they're living inside
[02:41:36.080 --> 02:41:41.760]  of the protected perimeter so when somebody in a suit and tie with a clean shave and face walks up
[02:41:41.760 --> 02:41:47.920]  and shoots a tier one you know ambassador in the head that gets their attention i'll call people's
[02:41:47.920 --> 02:41:55.360]  attention also back to um previous assassinations by security indira gandy was killed by a uh
[02:41:55.360 --> 02:42:01.040]  security guard anwar sadat was killed by soldiers that jumped out of a truck during a um pass and
[02:42:01.040 --> 02:42:06.480]  review so you know the the elites they start to freak out when they see their own security agents
[02:42:07.120 --> 02:42:11.520]  assassinating them from behind because they're all surrounded by security that they think well
[02:42:11.520 --> 02:42:15.120]  sure i mean it's normally you're secure people always ask why don't get security i said it's
[02:42:15.120 --> 02:42:20.240]  usually your security that kills you that's what people contract with to kill you yeah and it's it's
[02:42:20.240 --> 02:42:26.080]  yeah they're not in not in all cases but i mean they are susceptible to being paid to but paid by
[02:42:26.080 --> 02:42:30.240]  the highest bidder look at rf i mean i mean that was some of the security killed him there in la
[02:42:30.240 --> 02:42:35.680]  absolutely but but what do you think the overall message is i mean the jihadis i guess i mean as
[02:42:35.680 --> 02:42:40.960]  you said they're testing merkel and others to make sure they sit there and cover up its islam
[02:42:40.960 --> 02:42:46.800]  that's part of their deal right well if merkel doesn't resign now obviously she's you know never
[02:42:46.800 --> 02:42:53.680]  going to resign if she's reelected then for put a fork in germany and as germany goes europe goes
[02:42:53.680 --> 02:42:59.280]  i i read something for gates of the anil last year about um hybrid vigor you know that i don't
[02:42:59.280 --> 02:43:06.560]  worry about uh you know germans but i worry a lot about islamized germans super germans it was the
[02:43:06.560 --> 02:43:12.560]  it was the berbers of morocco that invaded spain after they were islamized and had that convert
[02:43:12.560 --> 02:43:18.640]  zeal it wasn't a skinny little desert arabs it was the berbers of morocco after they had become
[02:43:18.640 --> 02:43:24.160]  islamized i fear what will happen when germans are islamized you know when all of these german
[02:43:24.160 --> 02:43:29.600]  lesbians are suddenly having five or six children like it or not that are going to be raised to
[02:43:29.600 --> 02:43:36.160]  muslim in one or two generations germany could become a powerhouse of europe in a very bad way
[02:43:36.160 --> 02:43:41.040]  well by the way islam i mean we've got top imams saying we're going to take the women we're going
[02:43:41.040 --> 02:43:45.600]  to make our new super islam people ha ha ha the men are pigs they're cowards they give us their
[02:43:45.600 --> 02:43:50.480]  women i mean they're so freaking arrogant right and there but there are heroes in europe like
[02:43:50.480 --> 02:43:57.040]  dirt wielders and you know he's he is very similar to trump in this respect he understands the media
[02:43:57.040 --> 02:44:03.680]  jujitsu a year ago people thought trump was an idiot for you know going face to face with the
[02:44:03.680 --> 02:44:08.640]  mainstream media in ways that weren't flattering to him you know putting out tweets that people
[02:44:08.640 --> 02:44:13.840]  said were stupid or blunders but he was appealing to the to joe blue collar he was appealing to
[02:44:13.840 --> 02:44:19.840]  middle america and dirt wielders is doing the same thing so when they when when the these left wing
[02:44:19.840 --> 02:44:25.920]  politicized judges in holland uh convict dirt wielders of saying nasty things about moroccan's
[02:44:25.920 --> 02:44:31.760]  that just makes him more popular so he's he's understanding this populist jujitsu the way
[02:44:31.760 --> 02:44:36.960]  that that trump did the way that the left in this country is still trying to figure out they're still
[02:44:36.960 --> 02:44:41.680]  trying to you know go back to the old playbook let's blame it on the russians or blame it on
[02:44:41.680 --> 02:44:46.800]  fake news they they still don't know what's hitting them so there's still a lot of room out here for
[02:44:46.800 --> 02:44:53.360]  the populist jujitsu experts and i i hope the best for uh for wielders in holland i think is
[02:44:53.360 --> 02:45:00.480]  his um election is in march february or march so we should see a very interesting 2017 and remember
[02:45:00.480 --> 02:45:06.160]  also in germany and across europe it's only because of luck and incompetence on the part of these
[02:45:06.160 --> 02:45:11.280]  terrorists that there aren't attacks like last night weekly and there was a 12 year old about a
[02:45:11.280 --> 02:45:16.880]  week ago who was trying to take a nail bomb into another festival you know if that had gone off
[02:45:16.880 --> 02:45:22.480]  it would have been another i was told by sources a year ago it was christmas again and and then
[02:45:22.480 --> 02:45:27.440]  also about six months ago oh the germans keep busting them with big plastic explosive bombs
[02:45:27.440 --> 02:45:31.760]  that somebody's giving them in ambulances instead of trying to get them into sporting events to blow
[02:45:31.760 --> 02:45:37.200]  up a whole crowd and sure enough then it came out the news that they've busted other ones
[02:45:37.200 --> 02:45:42.480]  trying to blow up soccer events so man they're trying to they're trying to um
[02:45:43.760 --> 02:45:50.080]  they they when they owned muzzle they had a university in an oil region in northern iraq
[02:45:50.640 --> 02:45:59.120]  and for a couple years they were uh churning out university laboratory level of chemists
[02:45:59.120 --> 02:46:07.280]  trained in just one thing making making uh wow the uh praxide explosive um so that they can then go
[02:46:07.280 --> 02:46:14.960]  to europe and become teachers you know if you if you um know how to make the uh the uh you know
[02:46:14.960 --> 02:46:20.640]  trot that try praxide formula all you need to do is you know buy bulk stuff that you can buy
[02:46:20.640 --> 02:46:26.560]  at cosmetology stores and supermarkets and so forth and you can make something as powerful as c4
[02:46:26.560 --> 02:46:32.160]  that's what blew up the bus in the subway in london it's very and the train in madrid it's very
[02:46:32.160 --> 02:46:36.640]  powerful it doesn't have a great shelf life it's hard to work with but it's extremely powerful
[02:46:37.280 --> 02:46:42.720]  and they've got now you know dozens if not hundreds of these chemists in europe most of them
[02:46:42.720 --> 02:46:46.960]  ask you this question what is the master plan of the left to bring in five million of these people
[02:46:46.960 --> 02:46:52.800]  in europe hundreds of thousands here not vet them get them in his sleeper cells because from my study
[02:46:52.800 --> 02:46:57.040]  they don't totally control the islamicists they have some control through rogue groups
[02:46:57.760 --> 02:47:03.440]  in mi6 the israelis and the cia and well i think they're i think that they're evil of course but
[02:47:04.080 --> 02:47:09.280]  at at the you know the more naive ones might think that they're going to just ride the tiger of
[02:47:09.280 --> 02:47:14.880]  islam and then in the wreckage of europe established communism sure they're just taking
[02:47:14.880 --> 02:47:19.440]  money from saudi arabia now because they can live in a bigger apartment or drive a Ferrari but
[02:47:19.440 --> 02:47:25.520]  the better the better example the better part paradigm is carlos the jackal who actually wrote
[02:47:25.520 --> 02:47:32.320]  a biography from his prison in uh in france where he is converted to islam you know he was a communist
[02:47:32.320 --> 02:47:38.240]  beta minehawk type guy in the 60s and 70s he converted to islam and he actually wrote a letter
[02:47:38.240 --> 02:47:43.360]  to uh president obama which was published which is pretty amazing um saying that you know only
[02:47:43.360 --> 02:47:49.280]  only a alliance between you know the left and islam will ever be powerful enough to destroy
[02:47:49.280 --> 02:47:53.920]  capitalism in the west let's be clear the left hates their smartphones their money their great
[02:47:53.920 --> 02:47:59.360]  medicine everything so much and they love warren che Guevara shirts so much that they would ally was
[02:47:59.360 --> 02:48:05.760]  something that literally keeps women as animals all because they have some weird hate of the west
[02:48:05.760 --> 02:48:10.400]  yes and when it comes illness that was implanted in them where the hell does this come from but
[02:48:10.400 --> 02:48:16.720]  when it when it gets to to uh uh you know not cutting time when it gets to head shopping time
[02:48:16.720 --> 02:48:22.880]  history shows conclusively that these guys like carlos the jackal they take the easy way and convert
[02:48:22.880 --> 02:48:29.280]  to islam because remember if you're a totalitarian bastard and you're a man islam's not a bad deal
[02:48:29.280 --> 02:48:36.640]  you got to beat your old lady you get to you know rape children marry your cousin's you know uh
[02:48:36.640 --> 02:48:43.600]  daughter who's 13 years old and beat her if she doesn't put out i mean so for a an evil man islam
[02:48:43.600 --> 02:48:49.760]  is a pretty easy conversion from being an evil communist now the the commie women they're the
[02:48:49.760 --> 02:48:53.600]  ones that are gonna wake up in a burqa wondering what the heck happened to them you know these
[02:48:53.600 --> 02:48:58.560]  german women that aren't making babies will be making babies whether they like it or not if
[02:48:58.560 --> 02:49:05.360]  you know when islam succeeds with their you know five babies per woman uh birth rate compared to
[02:49:05.360 --> 02:49:11.440]  1.1 which is i know how did the west teach suicide to its people it's just crazy to watch
[02:49:12.080 --> 02:49:18.560]  yeah i you have to go back to antonio graham see and the frankfurt group and the uh uh
[02:49:19.200 --> 02:49:24.720]  who are the guys in england the um uh anyway the the communists of the early 20th century
[02:49:24.720 --> 02:49:30.400]  the fabian socialists all of fabians it's it's going to be the long the long march through
[02:49:30.400 --> 02:49:35.040]  the institutions that was the way that were they said and they caused it and now they just want to
[02:49:35.040 --> 02:49:39.200]  the weird thing is from within they took over they run everything why would they want to then
[02:49:39.200 --> 02:49:46.960]  blow it up well they thought that they could establish communism but as communism has been
[02:49:46.960 --> 02:49:53.120]  defeated and pushed back the only thing that they've got left is this alliance with islam
[02:49:53.120 --> 02:50:00.240]  and this is a you know a word of warning to women the men who preach communism and pivot to islam
[02:50:00.240 --> 02:50:06.640]  aren't going to see a big decrease in their lifestyle they may have two or three women
[02:50:06.640 --> 02:50:14.320]  after that the women who think that they're going to stick with communism are the real fools in this
[02:50:14.320 --> 02:50:19.440]  because they're going to wind up in a harem wearing a burqa having five babies like it or not i know
[02:50:19.440 --> 02:50:24.320]  it's so crazy they'll be allowed out if you're a piranha that worships it helps keep the other
[02:50:24.320 --> 02:50:28.480]  women in line you'll be kind of the house slave we're going to break come back take a few final
[02:50:28.480 --> 02:50:32.000]  calls and then five minutes the next hour a few calls and end of the time to paul watson i said
[02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:37.360]  earlier i would get into the big you know white man's guilt secret they're spending this whole
[02:50:37.360 --> 02:50:40.960]  thing like oh my nori's it's your time to take over america and you've got to be communist now or

[02:54:03.680 --> 02:54:07.600]  and poll watts is taken over from London england i just want to say this the real discussion going on
[02:54:07.600 --> 02:54:11.280]  with white people that i know that it's successful in business and life most of them are married to
[02:54:11.280 --> 02:54:16.800]  somebody of another quote race it's the human race and a lot of marm is you know whites are now
[02:54:16.800 --> 02:54:21.680]  16th or 17th in mobility economically certainly you can say things were geared towards whites
[02:54:21.680 --> 02:54:26.640]  50 years ago or whatever but most white folks have gotten spoiled or their kids are spoiled
[02:54:26.640 --> 02:54:33.280]  that's why we're not upwardly mobile it's it's you know you know christian lebanese or chinese or
[02:54:33.280 --> 02:54:37.680]  whatever that you see at the top of the chart but they sell this idea that white people existing
[02:54:37.680 --> 02:54:42.240]  is why you're poor instead of wanting to find out why there was so much wealth and get involved in
[02:54:42.240 --> 02:54:47.680]  free market and that's the establishment wanting a permanent underclass and they write white papers
[02:54:47.680 --> 02:54:51.760]  on it they admit it and that's what's so dastardly about this is they claim they want you to be
[02:54:51.760 --> 02:54:56.080]  successful but they really just want to control you and so now the discussions are well the white
[02:54:56.080 --> 02:55:00.960]  people didn't have kids and aborted all their kids we really all need to really try even though we're
[02:55:00.960 --> 02:55:05.920]  not in power to try to educate people from the third world that never had this so the americana
[02:55:05.920 --> 02:55:11.040]  fuser can go on because people always want to pass something on it's like these the allegory
[02:55:11.040 --> 02:55:15.120]  of a fiction you know the grand terino he didn't like his family so he they're all spoiled rotten
[02:55:15.120 --> 02:55:19.600]  brats so he you know gives his car away you know you know to the kid he liked next door
[02:55:19.600 --> 02:55:24.480]  and you know it's kind of that way you can inherit the west if you want it but my god let's not give
[02:55:24.480 --> 02:55:30.800]  it to radical islam matt bracken's our guest we should also probably give you his website as well
[02:55:30.800 --> 02:55:36.240]  enemies farne domestic dot com the gates of vienna also some other great site that his work appears
[02:55:36.240 --> 02:55:44.080]  on to find his books ryan in wyoming thanks for holding her on the air first of all i just wanted
[02:55:44.080 --> 02:55:49.840]  to say i believe the answer is sovereign men and women and sovereign households becoming self
[02:55:52.800 --> 02:55:59.040]  self-sufficient and your store your product x2 water filters everybody needs to get up
[02:55:59.040 --> 02:56:07.680]  uh the point i wanted to bring up was the tet 2 offensive um in december of 2015 there were
[02:56:07.680 --> 02:56:13.600]  hundreds of propane tanks that were stolen also at the same time uh there were hundreds of cell
[02:56:13.600 --> 02:56:21.280]  phones uh that were sold and um i just wanted to get mr bracken's and well sure clearly there
[02:56:21.280 --> 02:56:26.080]  are jihad bases all over the country is sleeper cells that i guess the left can just give its
[02:56:26.080 --> 02:56:30.240]  nod they'll start blowing stuff up it's like the secret army then they bring in marshal law
[02:56:30.240 --> 02:56:34.800]  afterwards but if obama's gonna do that he's got 30 days thank you for the call great point ryan
[02:56:34.800 --> 02:56:40.960]  mr bracken what do you say to that well you know i can't rule anything out in terms of that timing
[02:56:40.960 --> 02:56:48.320]  but uh you know that if an attack of sufficient magnitude happens even under uh president trump
[02:56:48.880 --> 02:56:52.880]  it really wouldn't be that much of a different outcome if there's a grid attack you know even
[02:56:52.880 --> 02:56:58.320]  just a simple kinetic rifle attack against enough uh you know power power substations
[02:56:59.200 --> 02:57:03.040]  putting this country into a grid down scenario is going to be ugly no matter who's in charge
[02:57:03.040 --> 02:57:07.680]  same thing with crashing the economy some kind of a cyber attack that tanks out our banking system
[02:57:08.240 --> 02:57:13.760]  uh you know destroys the ebt system it won't matter if uh thomas jefferson or george washington
[02:57:13.760 --> 02:57:19.200]  are in charge there's not going to be an easy solution if the lights go out and our cities
[02:57:19.200 --> 02:57:24.160]  explode and soros has doubled the amount of money to domestic destabilization operations
[02:57:24.160 --> 02:57:28.560]  showing they're planning something big right and the media is going to continue to be their cheerleader
[02:57:28.560 --> 02:57:33.280]  i mean i'm watching the media and the only time that you see anything like a hate crime is is uh
[02:57:33.840 --> 02:57:40.400]  are these fake hoaxes the hoaxes you know the job babes that always turn out every case of
[02:57:40.400 --> 02:57:45.360]  islamism being attacked in america turns out to be fake but the media never shows that at all
[02:57:45.360 --> 02:57:50.240]  instead they'll they'll show some you know frat brother uh alleged incident like attacks on those
[02:57:50.240 --> 02:57:55.040]  vomit record levels yeah exactly it's it's totally sick well they've been apologizing for the latest
[02:57:55.040 --> 02:58:01.440]  jihad attack but the the thing is their power is slipping and you know uh drudge is right you are
[02:58:01.440 --> 02:58:07.520]  right uh other other people talking about this are right the media is a son julien assange he's
[02:58:07.520 --> 02:58:10.880]  certainly right he says they have less and less credit i mean they just have no pertinence they
[02:58:10.880 --> 02:58:16.000]  just aren't even on the radar no that's right your your star is rising and theirs is slipping
[02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:19.360]  they just don't know like it didn't a fun start to be rising but we're doing our duty it's the
[02:58:19.360 --> 02:58:23.280]  audience spreading the word spreading the videos people now realize i mean look the global is
[02:58:23.280 --> 02:58:27.440]  paying a total takeover of the country and basically reeducation telling us what words to use so of
[02:58:27.440 --> 02:58:32.160]  course there was a resistance to that and now if the if the if the controllers want to go to the
[02:58:32.160 --> 02:58:37.600]  next level my god they're gonna get their ass stomped back in 70 seconds we're gonna talk to uh

[03:01:47.920 --> 03:01:55.760]  awesome well i think it uh i don't know when i sent him a note i sent him a text when nbc cut him off
[03:01:55.760 --> 03:02:00.720]  when he decided to run for president and he had you know it's a hit show 15 20 million people a
[03:02:00.720 --> 03:02:05.600]  week watching the apprentice or celebrity apprentice and you know it's lots of sponsorship lots of
[03:02:05.600 --> 03:02:12.640]  and you know product placement endorsement deals and he basically told nbc fu you know they they're
[03:02:12.640 --> 03:02:19.760]  obviously you know as stuff transpired you can see how twisted it is towards the left and he
[03:02:19.760 --> 03:02:23.760]  you know and i told him i said hey man that was like an iron balls move to like do that and you
[03:02:23.760 --> 03:02:32.160]  got my respect and um you know just started talking with him and uh i just felt compelled to no one
[03:02:32.160 --> 03:02:36.720]  everybody thought it was a joke everybody thought that he wasn't serious it was like a publicity
[03:02:36.720 --> 03:02:45.280]  stunt and when uh you know i just wrote a piece of like my personal point of view like not my
[03:02:45.280 --> 03:02:51.680]  opinion not my this is the person that i saw and is this person cut out to be a president and it
[03:02:51.680 --> 03:02:59.360]  and it you know it was like 25 or 30 i don't even know how many it is now but 20 or 35 million views
[03:02:59.360 --> 03:03:05.360]  on facebook and uh you know kind of i was the first person to come out and endorse him hey man i
[03:03:05.360 --> 03:03:08.720]  have your back if you want to be president he doesn't need that i think it would a lot of people
[03:03:08.720 --> 03:03:15.760]  miss is he doesn't need to be president and he sure as hell doesn't need to go through the crazy
[03:03:15.760 --> 03:03:20.240]  amount of bs that he's had to go through and you figure if anybody's going to walk through fire
[03:03:20.240 --> 03:03:25.280]  like that and like he has been put under the microscope that he must really really love
[03:03:25.280 --> 03:03:30.640]  america and love this country well i took your endorsement i know you're a real guy people see

[03:03:49.600 --> 03:03:54.960]  they said no trumps for real and now you've seen it what he's gone through what he's done what he's
[03:03:54.960 --> 03:04:00.400]  done for us our families uh pointing out how we've been screwed over by special interests that have
[03:04:00.400 --> 03:04:06.720]  sold out the american dream because america was dominating world and so here we are he's he's gone
[03:04:06.720 --> 03:04:11.760]  through all this and now he bucked the system he defeated the republicans and the establishment
[03:04:11.760 --> 03:04:17.200]  saying he couldn't win the nomination or that they would take it away they failed and now here he is
[03:04:17.200 --> 03:04:23.760]  in every poll now even fixed polls surging past hillary clinton this is like beyond some football
[03:04:23.760 --> 03:04:29.120]  movie or something this is beyond some disney movie i'm like pinching myself jesse james is this real

[03:08:09.520 --> 03:08:16.640]  don't tread on me well i know one guy that doesn't like the new world order and that's why hollywood
[03:08:16.640 --> 03:08:21.440]  and others have attacked him and lied about him and that's jesse james and i was able to get him
[03:08:21.440 --> 03:08:27.520]  in studio the day before the election and he looked talked about a whole bunch of stuff i got the guy
[03:08:27.520 --> 03:08:33.440]  who's normally a man a few words to really open up about donald trump the new world order and how
[03:08:33.440 --> 03:08:38.880]  he used to think i was crazy now he thinks i'm dead on so here is the rest of the interview
[03:08:38.880 --> 03:08:43.440]  throughout the shower with jesse james i just talked to jesse a few days ago he wants to come back on
[03:08:44.000 --> 03:08:49.680]  probably after the new year and do a victory lap uh wow we've never seen such uh exuberance
[03:08:49.680 --> 03:08:55.120]  we've never seen such confidence according to gallup uh they're calling it trump foria
[03:08:55.120 --> 03:09:00.000]  and it's because folks understand that globalism has kept us poor and has been dumbing us down
[03:09:00.000 --> 03:09:04.480]  to control us by design and so we're going to cut these chains doesn't mean there's some
[03:09:04.480 --> 03:09:12.960]  panacea or some you know valhalla type uh you know perfectly wonderful utopia that we're going to
[03:09:12.960 --> 03:09:17.760]  build but it's going to be a lot better in a free society than what we see with the globalist
[03:09:17.760 --> 03:09:23.440]  and the authoritarian system they're building that is a dystopia we can't have utopia but we
[03:09:23.440 --> 03:09:30.000]  can certainly have something better than dystopia now here's the interview with jesse james i only
[03:09:30.000 --> 03:09:34.880]  bring this up because it's totally organic you know my daughter your daughter good friends
[03:09:34.880 --> 03:09:40.240]  it's crazy i'm not pushing trump paraphernalia on them i'm not saying do this or that political and
[03:09:40.240 --> 03:09:45.280]  they're big fans of trump for like over a year and that's what i'm saying the you know they're
[03:09:45.280 --> 03:09:49.440]  other friends are trump fans that's got to scare the system i talk to people with other kids at
[03:09:49.440 --> 03:09:55.120]  other schools they go no you know we're talking 12 13 year old girls kids boys for we were at dinner
[03:09:55.120 --> 03:10:02.160]  to tonight uh talking about they have like hillary has some snapchat filter app and she was all uh
[03:10:02.720 --> 03:10:08.720]  talking about how her and her friends at school you know we're doing the snapchat filter but acting
[03:10:08.720 --> 03:10:14.400]  like they're vomiting when they had like he's like hillary like i'm with her that's all over the web
[03:10:14.400 --> 03:10:18.800]  yeah yeah and it's funny so what does that say if if we pushed our kids to be for something they
[03:10:18.800 --> 03:10:22.320]  wouldn't do it i never told them anything about trump i try to shield them they're all trump
[03:10:22.320 --> 03:10:27.120]  trump i mean i know your daughter so what does that say well kids are a lot smarter than you know
[03:10:27.840 --> 03:10:32.720]  i didn't know anything about politics when i was growing up you know my grandpa like okay we're
[03:10:32.720 --> 03:10:37.520]  republicans and then my grandpa always watched nightly news and then read the paper and that's
[03:10:37.520 --> 03:10:43.360]  how you got information i think kids like have the world's biggest in encyclopedia now in all
[03:10:43.360 --> 03:10:47.600]  their pockets so they want to know something they can find out yeah and it's crazy but there's
[03:10:47.600 --> 03:10:51.520]  something positive about it because yeah i think so they're well informed and they're not gonna
[03:10:51.520 --> 03:10:55.840]  just do what everybody tells them or spoon feeds them you know well i don't want to build i have to
[03:10:55.840 --> 03:11:02.320]  be honest with you though i have to have to say this first and foremost i you know what

[03:13:15.680 --> 03:13:20.960]  beautiful but that one you sent me with the leaves yeah all the other people yep but the
[03:13:20.960 --> 03:13:25.040]  problem is you keep saying yeah i'll let you buy one and then you never let me buy one but the
[03:13:25.040 --> 03:13:29.600]  crazy thing is one i don't think folks actually understand you literally are making these this
[03:13:29.600 --> 03:13:34.480]  is not like you put your name on it i try to tell people but i think since i have this dude you go
[03:13:34.480 --> 03:13:39.920]  to your house it's like a volcano like a freaking fire shooting out you're in a space suit i think
[03:13:39.920 --> 03:13:44.080]  once you once you reach a certain level of fame people think that i'm like in my office with a
[03:13:44.080 --> 03:13:49.920]  top hat and a monocle and like oh you told me you said i don't even go in the house i don't like all
[03:13:49.920 --> 03:13:55.440]  these fat prince bulldogs yeah the the shop restroom was busted for about two weeks and i had to walk
[03:13:55.440 --> 03:14:00.560]  in the house to like piss and it like was the worst i never even leave the property though i'm
[03:14:00.560 --> 03:14:05.920]  like a hermit i just like to work that's a beautiful place out there now jessie looking at trump
[03:14:05.920 --> 03:14:11.040]  and in all of this listen i i i never liked the democrats the republicans don't deliver on what
[03:14:11.040 --> 03:14:14.880]  they say they're doing but i agree with their platform more but with trump i mean i've gone
[03:14:14.880 --> 03:14:21.440]  from like grudgingly supporting him a year and a half ago to like so proud that i'm supporting this
[03:14:21.440 --> 03:14:28.000]  guy the stamina the work the attacks the demon it'll be it'll be it'll it'll be the best vetted
[03:14:28.000 --> 03:14:34.240]  president we've ever had ever and i think uh everybody was ready for a change when not the
[03:14:34.240 --> 03:14:39.760]  obama change but when obama ran the first time i bought into it a little bit i was like well
[03:14:39.760 --> 03:14:44.000]  hey man it'd be cool to have a blast i'll be honest i was neutral because i was sick of republicans
[03:14:44.640 --> 03:14:48.880]  it'll be cool to have a i grew up in the hood man i was born in lidwood and grew up in south gate
[03:14:48.880 --> 03:14:52.720]  long beach and i was like man it'd be cool to have a brother as president you know that's what we need
[03:14:52.720 --> 03:14:57.440]  i want to you know we needed billy d williams to come in and like look my book this was going to
[03:14:57.440 --> 03:15:03.520]  be like you know we needed that instead we got urkel and then everybody realized like oh wait he's
[03:15:03.520 --> 03:15:09.360]  a college professor and it's like if college professors were so great at what they do how
[03:15:09.360 --> 03:15:14.320]  come they're not all billionaires well not exactly not not teachers because there is a
[03:15:14.320 --> 03:15:19.840]  recreation somebody goes and teaches but teachers teach because they can't do yeah every every
[03:15:19.840 --> 03:15:24.080]  college professor when i was in college they're all disgruntled they all feel like everything
[03:15:24.080 --> 03:15:29.520]  stacked against them and they're all like i don't know i just i'm so disappointed because that guy
[03:15:29.520 --> 03:15:35.520]  could have been so great he could have been he single-handedly he with like a few words
[03:15:36.080 --> 03:15:41.840]  he could end all division in this country he could end all racism he could lift up homeless
[03:15:41.840 --> 03:15:48.160]  people and all that stuff but that's why it's really all about it's all about himself it's all
[03:15:48.160 --> 03:15:52.720]  about you know how where's he gonna land soft at what kind of a badass house is he gonna have
[03:15:52.720 --> 03:15:57.200]  that's what it's all about i was about to say they we thought bush was bad vacationing two months
[03:15:57.200 --> 03:16:03.360]  a year three four five months a year you can tell a lot about people i know bush's secret service
[03:16:03.360 --> 03:16:09.680]  guys and that guy's he's nice it's the greatest guy ever i know uh some of the couple of secret
[03:16:09.680 --> 03:16:15.840]  service guys we did guns that are with trump now and he's you know he that guy's like down to earth
[03:16:15.840 --> 03:16:21.280]  you know he's hanging out i know i know i know a guy was with hillary and i know one guy that's
[03:16:21.280 --> 03:16:27.520]  with michelle and a former guy with obama and they all three of them treat them like dirt
[03:16:27.520 --> 03:16:32.480]  oh hillary doesn't like i think i think i'm a firm believer that you can tell a lot about a person
[03:16:32.480 --> 03:16:36.960]  is how they treat the little guy and when they treat him like they're you know what that means
[03:16:36.960 --> 03:16:41.840]  it means they're in a position they didn't earn you know trump say what man that guy's had ups
[03:16:41.840 --> 03:16:46.560]  and downs everything else but he earned where he's at and he has to bust his ass to stay there
[03:16:46.560 --> 03:16:51.600]  and his dad was literally blue collar came from nothing that's the secret of trump yeah you know
[03:16:51.600 --> 03:17:00.880]  and i i just i don't know i have i think every myself you everybody with all the information
[03:17:00.880 --> 03:17:05.600]  that we can get now especially like wiki leaks and all that stuff is you feel it makes you feel
[03:17:05.600 --> 03:17:10.800]  helpless because you just want to go over and like like jump you just want to grab jump just
[03:17:10.800 --> 03:17:14.880]  and shake him you know i agree because i'm out of god calling for violence but i'm always
[03:17:14.880 --> 03:17:25.040]  not but we can't do anything i actually start having like fantasies because let me ask you
[03:17:25.040 --> 03:17:29.440]  this question okay i don't sit here and say what i want to believe i say what's happening i've talked
[03:17:29.440 --> 03:17:34.240]  the top pollster to see the numbers trump surging he clearly is winning the battleground states
[03:17:34.240 --> 03:17:39.840]  what do we do tomorrow night when CNN says she won i mean what do i do i'm not going to be violent
[03:17:39.840 --> 03:17:45.600]  but i'm not going to stop promoting liberty well you know i don't know you know i think people
[03:17:46.400 --> 03:17:52.000]  need to figure out a way to rise up and band together and you know if we can't vote someone
[03:17:52.000 --> 03:17:57.360]  out of office that is is ineffective and keep someone out of office that's a obvious thief
[03:17:57.360 --> 03:18:02.720]  and stealing from us you know i just look at like all the money that hillary's taken in the foundation
[03:18:02.720 --> 03:18:07.520]  you know imagine the dent she could have made in the homeless situation in america
[03:18:08.080 --> 03:18:12.000]  how she stole 94 percent of the Haitian money yeah you know come on like
[03:18:12.960 --> 03:18:18.480]  who comes up with this let me ask you this question looking at this and let's talk about
[03:18:18.480 --> 03:18:22.800]  Donald trump because you've told me stuff about from nothing secret or private just how real he

[03:24:04.160 --> 03:24:09.520]  i posted something after i voted last week and i had a uaw shirt on from the old uh
[03:24:09.520 --> 03:24:15.040]  uh mound road plant that made like i think they made christ or engines and then someone posted
[03:24:15.040 --> 03:24:19.280]  something about like oh mike pants you know he's a union buster and stuff like that i'm like
[03:24:20.240 --> 03:24:26.000]  don't you think unlimited immigration and letting people flood in the country isn't
[03:24:26.000 --> 03:24:31.200]  that kind of a union buster yeah why do the unions nothing is people coming in i get what
[03:24:31.200 --> 03:24:35.360]  they're doing it why do we have to pay for everybody and then have obama did you see him
[03:24:35.360 --> 03:24:40.800]  with the interviewer saying i'm illegal i'm gonna vote he goes well that's your right to do yeah i
[03:24:40.800 --> 03:24:45.520]  just think you know hey doesn't mean we hate anybody but can we go to china or mexico and vote
[03:24:45.520 --> 03:24:49.920]  look honestly like i've ran a business for 25 years and i had a couple hundred employees in
[03:24:49.920 --> 03:24:54.720]  california and a good portion of those people were without papers and i could take them right
[03:24:54.720 --> 03:25:00.640]  down to the spot where i knew a guy i could get a real green card for each of them for 600 bucks
[03:25:00.640 --> 03:25:07.920]  and get a real social security guard with the hologram for two grand but in retrospect thinking
[03:25:07.920 --> 03:25:13.440]  about that now like the guys like alex that you met at the shop he's from honduras and he's like
[03:25:13.440 --> 03:25:19.120]  got a lawyer he's already in the in the citizenship process i agree make it make the legal process
[03:25:19.120 --> 03:25:24.320]  pays taxes because you know what we are america and we do let the democrats want to keep it
[03:25:24.320 --> 03:25:30.880]  underground so they control it but here's the thing like we can let millions of people in there
[03:25:30.880 --> 03:25:35.680]  but every one of those millions of people should stand side by side with us on tax day and pay
[03:25:35.680 --> 03:25:43.360]  their fair share and i think a lot of the people you know i watched every friday on payday at west
[03:25:43.360 --> 03:25:48.240]  coast choppers and long beach i'd sign all their paychecks and they were the mobile check cashing
[03:25:48.240 --> 03:25:53.920]  truck used to pay pull up and they'd all cash their checks not take any taxes out and send most
[03:25:53.920 --> 03:25:59.680]  of the money back to mexico and i'll say this right now you do have to pledge allegiance if you
[03:25:59.680 --> 03:26:04.240]  want to be in this yeah i don't care what color you are you're going to be pro private property
[03:26:04.240 --> 03:26:10.560]  pro family pro gun we're going to make you wealthy but you got to sign on and not be a socialist well
[03:26:10.560 --> 03:26:17.120]  it's it's it's about us not me because me running my business like that and saving money on labor
[03:26:17.120 --> 03:26:21.280]  i was only thinking about myself i wasn't thinking about the betterment of the country
[03:26:21.280 --> 03:26:25.920]  because there is guys that have all legal employees and they're all paying taxes sure but
[03:26:25.920 --> 03:26:29.360]  you're being honest it was a part of your process yeah it was part of the process and i mean it's
[03:26:29.360 --> 03:26:34.000]  like i paid for abortion it doesn't have paid for abortions when i was 18 now i'm against it
[03:26:34.000 --> 03:26:37.920]  and it doesn't mean i'm something correct i'm just being honest about it yeah but i think you grow
[03:26:37.920 --> 03:26:43.440]  yeah yeah and it's you learn like hey you know that's not you know when when the price for american
[03:26:43.440 --> 03:26:48.400]  made goods goes through the roof and everything goes to china that's why because not only was i
[03:26:48.400 --> 03:26:52.560]  finding cheaper labor but people are taking in another step and like okay let's ship all the
[03:26:52.560 --> 03:26:57.120]  stuff over to china make it over there make it in pakistan or south america well it's worse you
[03:26:57.120 --> 03:27:04.400]  read the globalist documents they made deals to pass tax laws and stuff where it makes you go to
[03:27:04.400 --> 03:27:09.440]  china so the globalists the different leftists and people the banks could manage deals with the
[03:27:09.440 --> 03:27:14.800]  communist generals on how could you get into china see so they actually induced us to go to china
[03:27:14.800 --> 03:27:20.640]  well i think all these issues i think with the people that support hillary have strong
[03:27:22.720 --> 03:27:28.240]  feelings for all only themselves like what's i don't i personally i found i'm gonna erupt you
[03:27:28.240 --> 03:27:32.960]  jesse james right now here with us they've got studies out of canada we can pull up studies out
[03:27:32.960 --> 03:27:38.080]  of the uk and the us actually went out of texas i don't mean this mean but people calling themselves
[03:27:38.080 --> 03:27:45.520]  liberal are six times more likely to steal ten times more likely not to give a charity and
[03:27:45.520 --> 03:27:54.160]  are just the self-centered people that social justice warrior uh moral signal all day long
[03:27:54.160 --> 03:27:59.280]  but they're actually and then conservatives not that term are way more lucky to give so you just
[03:27:59.280 --> 03:28:03.600]  hit the nail on the head from your experience flesh that out what are you getting at because
[03:28:03.600 --> 03:28:07.760]  to me that's the essence i don't know i think i was born in the wrong generation you know i got
[03:28:07.760 --> 03:28:14.000]  a lot of the reagan generation coming off the iran crisis and the hostage crisis and i saw you
[03:28:14.000 --> 03:28:20.400]  know even as a kid like 10 years old i was like man carter's weak you know he's not he's not strong
[03:28:20.400 --> 03:28:26.000]  and i think i've said it for years you know we need someone that's you know i don't know how much
[03:28:26.000 --> 03:28:30.480]  control a president will have fighting against congress you know it's always going to be a
[03:28:30.480 --> 03:28:37.600]  a push and pull but at least they need to be a president they need to like rally people and
[03:28:37.600 --> 03:28:43.920]  rally people together and realize like you know it's united we stand and if you if everybody's
[03:28:43.920 --> 03:28:48.000]  only thinking about themselves and it's a personality conflict and stuff like that
[03:28:48.000 --> 03:28:53.920]  i don't care if the person elected president you know looks like godzilla as long as he's in there
[03:28:53.920 --> 03:29:00.160]  doing the job and supports people and lifts us up and knows you know hey when trump wins tomorrow
[03:29:00.160 --> 03:29:06.240]  i'm not going to have any regrets against anybody that voted for hillary or have any ill will towards
[03:29:06.240 --> 03:29:10.720]  them you know what because we're all americans they don't get a nation is like a ship i mean we're
[03:29:10.720 --> 03:29:14.720]  on the same team yeah and it's like we all have to like band together and we have you know
[03:29:15.280 --> 03:29:25.200]  for you know i opened a homeless shelter in long beach in 2004 and my big building there i donated
[03:29:25.200 --> 03:29:30.800]  and it's the long beach rescue mission but i went against the grain when long beach all the other
[03:29:30.800 --> 03:29:35.360]  businesses in the business corridor downtown wrote me these nasty letters saying we should bust the
[03:29:35.360 --> 03:29:40.160]  homeless out of long beach and stuff like that i'm like you know what no i bought a building and like
[03:29:40.160 --> 03:29:45.280]  opened it but i made it so you had to be employable
[03:29:45.280 --> 03:29:55.680]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:29:59.680 --> 03:30:04.960]  president obama is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors you may not know about until now
[03:30:04.960 --> 03:30:09.840]  for one thing he illegally gave obama care exemptions to unions that supported the passage of
[03:30:09.840 --> 03:30:14.720]  obama care that's right obama gave some of his favorite organizations exemption from some of
[03:30:14.720 --> 03:30:19.200]  obama care's requirements because many of them were unions and other groups that pressured the
[03:30:19.200 --> 03:30:24.640]  public to support the socialist program once these groups realized just how bad obama care really
[03:30:24.640 --> 03:30:29.920]  was they wanted exemptions from the very same law they forced on everyone else which obama gave them
[03:30:29.920 --> 03:30:35.040]  president obama also had the irs grant special illegal favors for his brother's so-called
[03:30:35.040 --> 03:30:39.760]  charity the daily caller reported the irs had taken the unprecedented step of approving a
[03:30:39.760 --> 03:30:45.520]  nonprofit application within just one month from the barrick h obama foundation additionally the iris
[03:30:45.520 --> 03:30:50.480]  illegally gave retroactive approval for the organization's taxes and status you can find

[03:33:20.080 --> 03:33:25.360]  looking at her um well the damascus pistols one that i forged that you saw me doing a little bit
[03:33:25.360 --> 03:33:33.600]  of and this is a 300 win mag like precision bolt action rifle and uh we import a barrel in action
[03:33:33.600 --> 03:33:38.560]  from england from rpa in england and in every other piece except for the optic we make in house
[03:33:39.360 --> 03:33:44.240]  and you know just now i know you've got a few little factories and stuff and you also fill
[03:33:44.240 --> 03:33:49.120]  to your shop we use some cars and motorcycles but when i'm over your place i mean it's like
[03:33:49.120 --> 03:33:53.120]  there's like one guy helping you're in there literally like out of a movie with like huge
[03:33:53.120 --> 03:33:57.920]  furnaces and blasting fire in a space suit and like turning this how do you do that you're like
[03:33:57.920 --> 03:34:02.640]  etching stuff yourself and i'm told this is like 18 hours a day i guess it's a love it well i think
[03:34:02.640 --> 03:34:07.840]  the business in california got so big that you know with hundreds of employees and stuff i didn't
[03:34:07.840 --> 03:34:13.840]  work anymore and i was miserable and now i've eliminated everything from my life that would
[03:34:13.840 --> 03:34:18.480]  stop me from working like there's no phone in the shop no tv so it's clear to say because i've
[03:34:18.480 --> 03:34:22.880]  been there you're almost like oh i'm gonna do this like third i mean you're like you love this i love
[03:34:22.880 --> 03:34:30.640]  it like i work i forged saturday all day making uh some damascus chef knives and um some billets
[03:34:30.640 --> 03:34:35.040]  i'm doing some guns out of statue of liberty material and so i was working on literally till
[03:34:35.040 --> 03:34:41.040]  like my ankle said fu and i i like i barely made it from the shop to the house and then just laid
[03:34:41.040 --> 03:34:45.120]  i was about to say though i don't just say this i mean that is there's something super manly about
[03:34:45.120 --> 03:34:49.200]  watching my grandfathers fix combines and they do how to do electricity or they do how to fix
[03:34:49.200 --> 03:34:53.920]  over that i don't know either that watching you in there it's just like like weapons and bad ass
[03:34:53.920 --> 03:34:58.320]  stuffs coming out i'm like this is humanity you know like like you were talking about one to teach
[03:34:58.320 --> 03:35:03.200]  people how to do that was we've lost that my dad knows how to fix anything compared to me he was his
[03:35:03.200 --> 03:35:08.320]  dad was better than him well i think we became we used to be a do-it-yourself society and now we
[03:35:08.320 --> 03:35:14.640]  became like a do-it-for-me society you know and everything's thrown throwing away like when this pen
[03:35:14.640 --> 03:35:18.720]  when that pen runs out you just throw it out well pens used to have cartridges in them
[03:35:18.720 --> 03:35:23.600]  they're beautiful yeah so when you when the pen went out you just put a new one in it you know
[03:35:23.600 --> 03:35:28.000]  and it's kind of like it's kind of like throw your family away throw america away well i think
[03:35:28.000 --> 03:35:33.200]  it's like disposable you know put it in a landfill and like you know i think every i don't know i think
[03:35:33.200 --> 03:35:37.680]  i was born in the wrong era you know i would have been better in the four what is that really cool
[03:35:37.680 --> 03:35:44.960]  big green machine you've got that's like a big robot it's a 1921 watson's film in a 350 ton
[03:35:44.960 --> 03:35:55.680]  forging press that says gargantua on it 350 ton yeah so and then i have like a 70s chambersburg
[03:35:55.680 --> 03:36:01.760]  forging hammer with a thousand pound head on it that's the machine weighs and what's that big
[03:36:01.760 --> 03:36:07.760]  spacesuit thing like you wear those like an iron and like you're in there and like the fire shooting
[03:36:07.760 --> 03:36:12.720]  well it's because i when i'm standing in front of the forge but actually i'm dumb because i just
[03:36:12.720 --> 03:36:16.800]  built a shield for the front of the forge and i kind of hide behind it now and turn it when it's in
[03:36:16.800 --> 03:36:22.000]  there and so now i was there you built more stuff yeah now i don't need all that so i can just do
[03:36:22.000 --> 03:36:27.600]  it with the put a bandana on some dark glasses i'm good still got big but what is it that so to the
[03:36:27.600 --> 03:36:34.240]  greeks the romans you name it primal about in the furnace the volcano just like building that well i
[03:36:34.240 --> 03:36:41.520]  think it's so simple like if you see like a you know a 3d cnc router cutting out something really
[03:36:41.520 --> 03:36:46.480]  crazy out of wood it's like the computer's doing all that i have all these giant machines but there
[03:36:46.480 --> 03:36:52.240]  still has to be like a dude in front of it and it's just you know pressure it's a human interface
[03:36:52.240 --> 03:36:59.040]  yeah it's pressure like a hammer big hammer small hammer you know some kind of pressure an anvil
[03:36:59.040 --> 03:37:05.600]  and heat it's only three elements i've had a chance to talk to trump some off air i've had him on
[03:37:05.600 --> 03:37:09.440]  air and i think it was the media always twisted makes me tell but you but i know you the first
[03:37:09.440 --> 03:37:14.480]  indoor trump i know you were on a show and i know he likes you he said that who what makes him tick
[03:37:14.480 --> 03:37:20.480]  because for me he's just he actually is like an underdog he actually is in a not being screwed
[03:37:20.480 --> 03:37:25.440]  over so he's very aggressive alpha male but he's not out to get the little guy he sees america
[03:37:25.440 --> 03:37:30.640]  being screwed over and wants to like really bring in a new golden age is that an accurate or is
[03:37:30.640 --> 03:37:36.160]  that statement wrong you know don't rub very well i mean who is all from i think he has a big heart
[03:37:36.160 --> 03:37:43.040]  you know he's he's a good father and i think that's his kids are a big priority and that says a lot
[03:37:43.040 --> 03:37:48.480]  about someone that puts you know hey the future of my kids in the forefront and it shows in his
[03:37:48.480 --> 03:37:57.440]  older kids and i think uh like eddie who runs the mail room at uh trump tower is a porto rican cat
[03:37:57.440 --> 03:38:03.040]  that's like you know and he's and like trump gets there every morning not when it's he's been on the
[03:38:03.040 --> 03:38:07.840]  road but he gets there every morning and like drinks coffee with him out of the coffee machine
[03:38:08.720 --> 03:38:14.240]  you know and it's like he treats it's not patronizing i'm told by a lot of folks he likes
[03:38:14.240 --> 03:38:19.200]  everybody yeah he really likes black people i'm told it's like i don't think he really
[03:38:19.920 --> 03:38:25.920]  likes people yeah he doesn't see that i mean i i mean when i was on the apprentice uh with
[03:38:25.920 --> 03:38:31.360]  denis rodman denis has an obvious really bad drinking problem and i i suffered that for
[03:38:31.360 --> 03:38:38.720]  a little bit and i really saw a side of him that like you know it was sad and and you know sadness
[03:38:38.720 --> 03:38:44.880]  with mixed with compassion and you know and it's not stuff that you can't fake that stuff you know
[03:38:44.880 --> 03:38:50.880]  you can't fake like you care you know you can fake happiness okay i've had conversation on
[03:38:50.880 --> 03:38:55.840]  conversations with trump and it's like he's like reading my mind it's crazy he's smart i mean well
[03:38:55.840 --> 03:39:00.720]  i think once he wins tomorrow and people really get to know him because all they're seeing is
[03:39:01.600 --> 03:39:07.840]  the you know media slanted the other way so they're gonna just cherry pick stuff that yeah he says
[03:39:07.840 --> 03:39:12.000]  his Spanish are great people really wonderful i love them they're the best but criminals are
[03:39:12.000 --> 03:39:15.680]  coming here we got to track them a lot of criminals they turn in all mexicans are criminals
[03:39:15.680 --> 03:39:21.840]  yeah and you know i'm in the interesting position that i felt that kind of ridicule and heat from
[03:39:21.840 --> 03:39:26.480]  media and tabloids and all that stuff so i know what it's like they'll twist anything to i gotta
[03:39:26.480 --> 03:39:30.560]  say i don't want to get into all that but i know separate from you i know the inside baseball and
[03:39:30.560 --> 03:39:35.520]  i talked to you and confirmed it you were so classy you never engaged you just sat there and took it
[03:39:35.520 --> 03:39:42.240]  all well a little bit yeah i mean you really did i remember seeing i mean you i mean i beat the
[03:39:42.240 --> 03:39:47.760]  out of a couple pomper out see only on no i get that but i mean you never struck back
[03:39:47.760 --> 03:39:56.240]  in a whole hollywood setup for pr yeah you know what i just kind of like uh you know took my licks
[03:39:56.240 --> 03:40:02.160]  and just walked away you know i didn't belong where i was anyway so you know i belong in my shop
[03:40:02.160 --> 03:40:06.400]  with my i'm about to say you're like people people think like jessie james is a wild man
[03:40:06.400 --> 03:40:11.520]  the number guy on tv reality tv guns everything and then knowing you it's like it's like whoa
[03:40:12.640 --> 03:40:17.760]  it's like there's not even anything going on here but reality it's the total difference than the
[03:40:17.760 --> 03:40:21.920]  emptiness of hollywood because you know you've been offered tons of stuff i've been offered things
[03:40:21.920 --> 03:40:27.280]  it's like so empty like thank god you're in austin brother you like being in austin i dig it except for

[03:40:59.360 --> 03:41:04.960]  stand where trump is where you see this going um unless i think if there's going to be any kind of
[03:41:04.960 --> 03:41:10.080]  foul player dirty tricks i think it'll be pretty obvious i think everything's so transparent now
[03:41:10.720 --> 03:41:15.920]  that i don't i don't see how they can get away with it then that's that's really the only chance
[03:41:15.920 --> 03:41:22.960]  she has to win and i think it's i've i've i have my ear to the ground and no people all over this
[03:41:22.960 --> 03:41:28.960]  country and i can feel the ground swell you know can't you feel it i can feel it i'm you know i can
[03:41:28.960 --> 03:41:34.320]  even talk and talk to my good friend robin in uh philadelphia and they tried to go to the trump
[03:41:34.320 --> 03:41:40.720]  rally like that's been about two or three weeks ago they didn't get within they got like 15 miles
[03:41:40.720 --> 03:41:47.840]  away from it i left four hours before he was here a few months ago yeah brother i was in traffic for
[03:41:47.840 --> 03:41:53.920]  two hours and gave up our crew got there they had to walk two miles in yeah i just think people are
[03:41:53.920 --> 03:42:00.240]  fed up people want their you know they may not know him that well but things suck so bad now
[03:42:00.240 --> 03:42:05.120]  they're willing to take a chance and they want they want i think we just need we need to be inspired
[03:42:05.760 --> 03:42:12.640]  i like how trump says i'm not perfect nobody is but i've grown i can really see that in the process
[03:42:12.640 --> 03:42:18.800]  and again well can you honestly look you know you trump loves this country and he loves the people
[03:42:18.800 --> 03:42:23.200]  and he loves that he's always been thankful for decades about that's why the leaders are scared
[03:42:23.200 --> 03:42:29.520]  can you honestly look at hillary and and think that she loves this country or loves the people
[03:42:30.080 --> 03:42:34.720]  you know the wiki league say she hates it you know it's it's all about money and i think it's
[03:42:35.520 --> 03:42:40.000]  i i think in her mind she probably doesn't think she's ever done anything any
[03:42:40.000 --> 03:42:45.840]  wrong i think you know she's probably whipping her own fumes and you know think oh i'm i'm amazing
[03:42:45.840 --> 03:42:51.840]  you know this i was the former first lady and you know secretary of state and i'm like everybody
[03:42:51.840 --> 03:42:57.200]  should kiss my ring yeah you know and waltz me right into the presidency i just titled it yeah
[03:42:58.240 --> 03:43:04.400]  i think she's good i think she's gonna be wearing an orange suit very soon well that's why they're
[03:43:04.400 --> 03:43:08.800]  so scared because you know trump elinot have been talking to folks they say if trump says
[03:43:08.800 --> 03:43:14.480]  something he's gonna try it and that's why he knows we've got trade deals that are totally
[03:43:14.480 --> 03:43:18.800]  one-sided that's what he's saying it's so easy it's so easy we're not going to screw mexico
[03:43:18.800 --> 03:43:24.160]  or china over we're just not going to have china with a 35 currency tax on us yeah we're not going
[03:43:24.160 --> 03:43:29.680]  to bend over and like let everybody take it to us that like you know we want to do business with
[03:43:29.680 --> 03:43:32.560]  i don't you love because i don't want business i'm talking to folks you're a good business
[03:43:32.560 --> 03:43:36.160]  guy you're not gonna get run over you do good deals same with me they go alex jones is a real
[03:43:36.160 --> 03:43:41.840]  business because yeah because i would let you run over me i do good deals it's the same thing
[03:43:41.840 --> 03:43:46.400]  no we're not screwing people but we're not here to be screwed yeah i think it's you know there's
[03:43:46.400 --> 03:43:51.760]  there's a difference between being a bit difference between being shrewd and like you know on top of
[03:43:51.760 --> 03:43:55.840]  your game business wise you know and it's like there's when you get a little bit of success
[03:43:55.840 --> 03:43:59.920]  there's people that'll personally you know purposely put themselves in your way to like
[03:43:59.920 --> 03:44:05.920]  steal from you or sue you or whatever you know and i've i've been through it all man like you know like
[03:44:05.920 --> 03:44:13.520]  and it's i think it kind of you build up a scab towards life and business and society and i just
[03:44:13.520 --> 03:44:19.920]  you know i think man if you or i did some of the stuff that hillary's done we'd be in jail
[03:44:19.920 --> 03:44:26.800]  yeah we'd be in jail and it's like you know i think the the stuff with comey this is how it
[03:44:26.800 --> 03:44:34.640]  works like comey's basically a front office guy right exactly so there's a spokesman there's there's
[03:44:34.640 --> 03:44:41.600]  fbi headquarters and there's field offices all over the country and agents handle investigations
[03:44:41.600 --> 03:44:47.920]  not the not the home office you know and politicals go to political dinners yeah and so
[03:44:49.920 --> 03:44:54.960]  for all we know the investigation could still be going on because agents could have taken it from
[03:44:54.960 --> 03:45:00.880]  um taken it at a at a field office and taken it over themselves well that's and that's happened
[03:45:00.880 --> 03:45:07.680]  actually the problem is they can't get it up through the justice department and agents can
[03:45:07.680 --> 03:45:13.440]  present their evidence to congress on their own i know you're like saying they could you're being
[03:45:13.440 --> 03:45:16.960]  told i'm guessing you've been told this i've been told this too they're ready for press conferences
[03:45:16.960 --> 03:45:25.680]  that's why hillary's so scared yep i i just think you know i think they got her you know i think they
[03:45:25.680 --> 03:45:33.200]  put some kind of pressure on comey so it didn't appear that he was like doing stuff to manipulate
[03:45:33.200 --> 03:45:40.400]  the election but i've had a lot of friends that have been under investigation by the feds and any
[03:45:40.400 --> 03:45:46.640]  of the ones that ever wrap smack about the feds or fbi's guess what guess what including my own sister
[03:45:47.520 --> 03:45:52.400]  guess what guess where they're all at in the pen yep and you know
[03:45:54.560 --> 03:46:02.480]  the when fbi comes to interview you they have a 97 conviction rate when they interview you
[03:46:02.480 --> 03:46:08.480]  they've already got you that they don't they don't they're not like the cops like oh man this guy
[03:46:08.480 --> 03:46:13.760]  smacked his wife we better drive out there and see what happened and do an investigation no the fbi
[03:46:13.760 --> 03:46:17.200]  doesn't operate like that yeah they wouldn't even mess with hillary they weren't one after
[03:46:17.200 --> 03:46:22.560]  yeah they don't waste their time and i you know i think it's only a matter of time will she you
[03:46:22.560 --> 03:46:29.280]  know and i i don't i don't i don't i'm glad it's not happening before the election because then
[03:46:29.280 --> 03:46:33.680]  they'll always like oh well that's what i was told they're only i was told it's after the election
[03:46:33.680 --> 03:46:39.040]  they're only i then everybody would always say oh trump only won because she went to jail
[03:46:39.040 --> 03:46:44.640]  no i don't want it like that i want him to like have an overwhelming day tomorrow where the people
[03:46:44.640 --> 03:46:50.640]  speak exactly and it's not that the police or the feds everybody's perfect what do you make of
[03:46:51.200 --> 03:46:56.480]  you know jesse james our guest here in studio on top tv hosts you know but really a metal urges
[03:46:56.480 --> 03:47:01.120]  you know top blacksmith over here expert in automobiles you name it i don't know how you describe
[03:47:01.120 --> 03:47:09.440]  it all but really cool stuff make good french toast to americana looking at this it's that hillary
[03:47:09.440 --> 03:47:13.680]  and the globalist are out to get the country and then they fund george soros this weirdo
[03:47:13.680 --> 03:47:20.960]  nausea collaborator i think one of my customers knows him and uh he just says the guy just hates
[03:47:20.960 --> 03:47:26.800]  america and i was like well i asked him i said well what's his in game like if soros is funding
[03:47:26.800 --> 03:47:31.520]  all this stuff what is it what is he's got to you know if he's putting millions of dollars out there
[03:47:31.520 --> 03:47:37.760]  what does he get and i guess he's like a global commodities guy and so he thinks that we collapsing
[03:47:37.760 --> 03:47:42.720]  and buy it up yep that's the tourism it's that well here's here's people ask me again low taxes
[03:47:42.720 --> 03:47:50.000]  prosperity great medical care a future not a semi you know these soros went on 16 minutes they've
[03:47:50.000 --> 03:47:54.080]  taken off the web we've got a clip of it but if you put it up they hit you with copyright and it's
[03:47:54.080 --> 03:48:01.120]  leslie stahl she's like 1999 she goes you help round up more than 10 000 jews and romanian hungry
[03:48:02.000 --> 03:48:09.120]  to apologize he goes no i do not it's what i need to do the point is this guy is the biggest demon
[03:48:09.120 --> 03:48:17.200]  you can imagine yeah he's here and just what you said he doesn't like all this prosperity and freedom
[03:48:17.200 --> 03:48:21.920]  he just wants to mount our head on the wall like i see somebody that's great at doing building stuff
[03:48:21.920 --> 03:48:27.920]  i admire him short soros would see you this great metallurgist this great artist he freaking hates you
[03:48:27.920 --> 03:48:34.160]  man you know like it's like this total difference between we love people that produce people it's
[03:48:34.160 --> 03:48:39.120]  like a brave new world you know dumbing down a society and we just want like worker drones that
[03:48:39.680 --> 03:48:44.480]  do their part and then die off and then we'll breed more and it like you know he thinks we're
[03:48:44.480 --> 03:48:50.160]  there to serve him yep and so let me ask you i think they want to bridge too far because cops aren't
[03:48:50.160 --> 03:48:56.320]  perfect there's bad cops well hey you know what in a litigious society though why aren't the dalis
[03:48:56.320 --> 03:49:02.320]  the families of the suing dalis officers suing that guy direct personally no i hear me out i
[03:49:02.320 --> 03:49:07.920]  totally i totally agree and anybody that lost their house or their business or anything in
[03:49:07.920 --> 03:49:12.640]  ferguson and why aren't they going after them because they're too chivalrous that's what i'm
[03:49:12.640 --> 03:49:16.800]  saying is that i'm somebody that's against the police state but that's a governmental issue
[03:49:16.800 --> 03:49:22.080]  that's the people the cop has one of the hardest craziest jobs on average there's a lot of people
[03:49:22.080 --> 03:49:25.840]  i think they judge because i have tattoos and i ride a bike and i'm from long beach and i grew
[03:49:25.840 --> 03:49:30.640]  up in the hood and they think i'm like an anti-police and i was an honorary long beach police officer
[03:49:30.640 --> 03:49:36.480]  for 15 years i went to meetings every week and it's like there's no way in hell that i would
[03:49:36.480 --> 03:49:41.440]  want to be a cop in this well that was my next point is you know cops have problems but on average
[03:49:41.440 --> 03:49:45.280]  compared to the general public they're more committed more involved points they're not perfect
[03:49:45.280 --> 03:49:50.080]  but what do you make of soros and obama i think that's their failure point is when they openly
[03:49:50.080 --> 03:49:54.880]  tried to cause a civil war and push groups that were saying kill cops you know and the the stuff
[03:49:54.880 --> 03:50:00.400]  with trevon martin ferguson all that stuff obama could have like ended it that's what i mean so
[03:50:00.400 --> 03:50:05.360]  what do you think's behind that i don't know you know i i kind of think like we don't you know
[03:50:05.360 --> 03:50:11.120]  we'll know in the next end time but i don't think we really know who obama was you know i think we
[03:50:11.120 --> 03:50:16.880]  all we all saw that one democratic national convention speech and we were going you know we
[03:50:16.880 --> 03:50:21.520]  were tired of iraq and tired of the bush years and we all saw that one speech like oh man this is
[03:50:21.520 --> 03:50:27.600]  what we need and we wrote that we didn't vet him we didn't do any of the stuff that they normally
[03:50:27.600 --> 03:50:33.200]  do and you know all this stuff that's happening now with the one sided with media and stuff
[03:50:33.200 --> 03:50:39.520]  that was all happening then but now we know yeah but net there was no wiki leaks and there was no

[03:54:19.840 --> 03:54:25.520]  and it's like uh you know russian censorship you know and that's like we've always prided ourselves
[03:54:25.520 --> 03:54:32.160]  as a free thinking free media exactly so how do you as a democrat because we've been to the events
[03:54:32.160 --> 03:54:36.160]  in furguson no no i'm saying i mean how do you use them hypothetically no not you how is somebody
[03:54:36.160 --> 03:54:40.240]  as a democrat because i'm never been a republican but i'm with them now compared to these people
[03:54:40.240 --> 03:54:47.760]  you sit there how do you we've had reporters in furguson and in and in and in uh detroit and in
[03:54:48.480 --> 03:54:53.200]  uh you know california just all over the country i can't run patrol places we've had reporters
[03:54:53.200 --> 03:54:59.120]  probably 30 places and there are literal college kids busted funded by move on and sorrows saying
[03:54:59.120 --> 03:55:04.160]  deck the halls with dead cops shoot cops that's calling for murder so i asked a question how do
[03:55:04.160 --> 03:55:11.840]  you get college kids beat their ass nightsticks again well i agree so how does you know how do
[03:55:11.840 --> 03:55:17.520]  you get somebody to randomly just say my cops gassing up his car i'm gonna walk up and shoot
[03:55:17.520 --> 03:55:23.440]  him in the head what what the hell man i don't i don't you know it's it's it's already a tough
[03:55:23.440 --> 03:55:30.400]  job enough to be a cop but to to then you know people trying i don't know so what do you think
[03:55:30.400 --> 03:55:35.360]  though you're a smart guy well i'm asking your view why is why are elements of the government of
[03:55:35.360 --> 03:55:40.000]  the democrats trying to say deck the halls with dead cops and then we get the last year a hundred
[03:55:40.000 --> 03:55:45.520]  cops are more murdered in cold blood no one even knew their name these people just kill them because
[03:55:45.520 --> 03:55:51.520]  msnbc said it was cool i don't know you know kind of it's probably the stuff you know that you've
[03:55:51.520 --> 03:55:56.720]  always said you know trying to start a civil war and trying to start unrest you know i don't i i
[03:55:56.720 --> 03:56:04.000]  just can't i can't put it together in my mind the the why someone would do that you know why i don't
[03:56:04.000 --> 03:56:08.800]  know you know i don't really know you're not a scumbag yeah and it's just like you know hey you
[03:56:08.800 --> 03:56:16.000]  know i've got my ass kicked by the cops before like a few times and you know what i totally deserve
[03:56:16.000 --> 03:56:23.520]  it they too you know and it's like cop showed up yeah and i think you know every now that everybody's
[03:56:23.520 --> 03:56:29.600]  got facebook live okay yeah cops gonna pull me over all i'm gonna feel i'm gonna talk smack to the
[03:56:29.600 --> 03:56:35.920]  cop and i think if we took out nightsticks and went crack like we used to then a lot of that would
[03:56:35.920 --> 03:56:41.040]  go away here's what i'll say we need balance in this country but the enemy is not local government
[03:56:41.040 --> 03:56:46.720]  the enemy are these multinational like for us yeah i think it i think it's you know if people are
[03:56:46.720 --> 03:56:51.200]  being it's a whole nother element it's one thing with civil unrest when because i live through the
[03:56:51.200 --> 03:56:56.720]  la riots and you know and it was pretty bad that was that was no one was paying people to do that
[03:56:56.720 --> 03:57:02.960]  people were genuinely pissed and south central about rodney king you know i don't agree with
[03:57:02.960 --> 03:57:08.320]  the way they went about it but i think you know those guys did beat rodney king's ass rodney king
[03:57:08.320 --> 03:57:13.760]  was resisting arrest but you know we're dead he may be deserved to get a thump on the back of the
[03:57:13.760 --> 03:57:18.560]  head or restraint not 20 but he didn't deserve to be kicked and get his ass kicked you know i come
[03:57:18.560 --> 03:57:24.480]  from the days were if you ran from the cops or you took a swing at a cop you got your ass kicked
[03:57:24.480 --> 03:57:29.840]  and if maybe it wasn't right then but it was back at the station when nobody could see it and that
[03:57:29.840 --> 03:57:34.480]  i think my experience with the cops was i don't want to get into but i mean they would actually
[03:57:34.480 --> 03:57:38.240]  find out what happened and let me go there was some other guy was a coma but i wasn't looking for
[03:57:38.240 --> 03:57:43.600]  trouble my only issue was there were some political cops were bad jessie james the time we have left
[03:57:43.600 --> 03:57:49.280]  you i'm just going to tell you inside baseball he literally made yeah basically support cops
[03:57:49.280 --> 03:57:55.760]  that's what i say well because here's the deal you compare the cops the general jellyfish you know
[03:57:55.760 --> 03:58:02.320]  what here's the bottom line you can talk all the you want about police officers and police abuse
[03:58:02.320 --> 03:58:08.640]  and all this stuff but when your 70 year old mom is choking to death on the floor of your kitchen
[03:58:08.640 --> 03:58:14.800]  you call 911 well i was about to say it's a cop out because it's individual and the person the
[03:58:14.800 --> 03:58:19.440]  cop is going to get there the fastest that's who's going to come and try to save her no i totally
[03:58:19.440 --> 03:58:24.560]  agree with you that statistically you've got a couple hundred people killed a year by cops
[03:58:24.560 --> 03:58:29.600]  maybe wrongfully but you've got thousands of people saved it becomes this establishment
[03:58:29.600 --> 03:58:39.600]  government that's so corrupt is wanting to scapegoat the police and so that's what i'm against
