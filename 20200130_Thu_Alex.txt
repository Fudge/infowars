[00:00.000 --> 00:19.680]  I'm just an average man with an average life I work from 9 to 5, hell I pay the price
[00:19.680 --> 00:31.200]  all I want is to be left alone in my average home would find you I always feel like I'm in the twilight moon and I always feel like somebody's watching me
[00:31.200 --> 00:39.600]  because you are being watched by other humans, by the AI, by the surveillance and by the fallen angels
[00:39.600 --> 00:49.120]  marooned on this planet with us and by the big guy, truly omnipresent, C's old
[00:49.120 --> 00:53.440]  you are being watched, everyone's being watched
[00:53.440 --> 00:57.760]  you're being watched from the heavens, you're being watched interdimensionally
[00:57.760 --> 01:06.240]  you're being watched at the subatomic level, God knows every atom that makes up every hair on your head
[01:10.880 --> 01:15.200]  that's right oh they say I'm crazy just a little touched like Narls Barkley says
[01:15.200 --> 01:20.960]  I was crazy but not because I didn't know because I knew too much
[01:22.800 --> 01:26.080]  all right I've got a good handle on what's going on with the virus now
[01:27.920 --> 01:33.280]  I really have pressed my mind and that's why yesterday I was going a lot of different directions
[01:33.280 --> 01:39.520]  I wouldn't call it floundering as much as Tasmanian around trying to just look at all the information
[01:39.520 --> 01:54.080]  but there's a clue in everything there's a congruency that runs through all of this continually
[01:57.120 --> 02:00.880]  and so I'm going to try my best to just calmly which we all know what that means
[02:00.880 --> 02:08.480]  and walk through this as best I can and then sounding board it off of you
[02:10.320 --> 02:11.440]  tell me what you think
[02:14.800 --> 02:21.120]  we can have that big college of discussion here on air that the system has struggled so incredibly hard
[02:22.720 --> 02:27.760]  to make sure can't happen the knowledge of the crowd the knowledge of the town square
[02:27.760 --> 02:31.840]  where the people come together to get answers and suss things out they don't want that they want
[02:31.840 --> 02:38.960]  the big corporate globalist on high men can have babies mothers and fathers are bad you can't say
[02:38.960 --> 02:46.640]  the word woman on the side of a bus in LA or London because some people don't identify as a woman
[02:46.640 --> 02:53.440]  and the word woman hurts them first it's the n-word now it's woman
[02:53.440 --> 03:01.040]  they want to hand down the most ridiculous crap to train us to accept it
[03:01.040 --> 03:06.000]  that if they serve up a big old steam and pilot dog crap and tell us it's dutch chocolate bluebell
[03:06.800 --> 03:12.480]  we go yes sir and start eating it with a helping of flies on top instead of pecans
[03:15.120 --> 03:19.440]  that's all any of this is is building a world where human activity is illegal
[03:19.440 --> 03:27.120]  so they want to retire pucks a tony fill the groundhog and have an AI robot do it
[03:27.120 --> 03:36.080]  pita is a eugenics cult run by dr peter singer on record who says parents have the right to kill
[03:36.080 --> 03:41.280]  children to age three and then once it's age three well we kill whoever we want the bioethics
[03:41.280 --> 03:49.840]  boards will decide whose life has value and who will live and who will die it's called playing god
[03:51.840 --> 03:55.760]  and statistically if you study eugenicists of the last censor in the center before
[03:56.400 --> 04:01.520]  they were the ones that always ended up in mental institutions riding on the walls in their own crap
[04:03.040 --> 04:08.800]  because they are demented and they are mentally you know trying to play god the imperfection
[04:08.800 --> 04:17.440]  is the perfection they are not going to protect us hard i'm gonna stop preaching here
[04:18.960 --> 04:21.680]  and when i come back i'm gonna do the best job i can to tell you what
[04:22.640 --> 04:28.320]  i know is going on with the virus we we know i know what's going on with it and
[04:30.000 --> 04:34.400]  i'm gonna lay it out now that doesn't mean i have all the answers the total projection of
[04:34.400 --> 04:41.120]  where it's going to go precisely but we know we know something very very important but i'm going
[04:41.120 --> 04:45.680]  to lay out when we return on the other side of this break i'm alex jones and remember the only
[04:45.680 --> 04:50.480]  way this transmission gets out is your word of mouth those precious local radio and tv stations
[04:50.480 --> 04:56.320]  and you spread the word about bandot video and news wars dot com forward slash show we'll be back
[04:58.640 --> 05:04.080]  well it's here the year 2020 world government's out in the open we've got the predicted mass
[05:04.080 --> 05:09.600]  pandemics and they're calling for global government as the answer and we've got massive huge censorship
[05:09.600 --> 05:16.320]  taking place it's coordinated by big tech and banks against people that promote america and guns
[05:16.320 --> 05:22.480]  and freedom and jesus and the family and the protection of the unborn wow yes now we know
[05:22.480 --> 05:27.440]  we're right the new world order is real satanism is real the pedophile a leader real but we're real
[05:27.440 --> 05:32.000]  as well and we love god and we're standing up and saying no but i just want to make the point here
[05:32.000 --> 05:37.280]  one month into 2020 that we have never been in cancels we have never been in some small
[05:37.280 --> 05:42.560]  village place that didn't matter everything we do every decision we make governs the future of our
[05:42.560 --> 05:46.000]  species and everything we've gone through and everything we're going to go through so it's
[05:46.000 --> 05:50.240]  an incredible town to be alive i'm going to thank you all for being aware and being involved but
[05:50.240 --> 05:56.080]  just remember your action now via prayer word of mouth and financial support of m4 short com
[05:56.080 --> 06:09.600]  is critical so please take action
[06:09.600 --> 06:21.120]  so
[06:22.160 --> 06:31.120]  from the front lines from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[06:31.120 --> 06:37.280]  but we are looking at you good and evil right and wrong a new world order
[06:40.080 --> 06:47.440]  a new world order we are broadcasting worldwide on this thursday
[06:49.120 --> 06:52.640]  january 30th 2020 transmission
[06:52.640 --> 07:01.280]  now let me make this statement hall joseph watson wrote an article that links to a respected
[07:02.800 --> 07:15.440]  medical company computer projection system and it predicts 183 million people will be
[07:15.440 --> 07:23.200]  infected by february 29th i know you're saying alex that's fake news there's not 29 days in february
[07:24.800 --> 07:32.800]  unless it's leap year see that's a little weird this year and 2020 so it's projected
[07:32.800 --> 07:45.680]  that this coronavirus would have infected 100 and 83 million people now
[07:47.840 --> 07:51.840]  if that's an accurate report and they're just going off the numbers they have
[07:52.960 --> 07:56.960]  and if you put that together with the lanset study there was a rush study and that had a
[07:56.960 --> 08:02.320]  smaller group than they wanted for the study because it's an emergency there's an 18 fatality
[08:02.320 --> 08:07.920]  rate well i i don't believe that because they're studying people that were in hospitals they know
[08:07.920 --> 08:15.520]  had it but let's say it's one percent one percent died let's just speculate that's
[08:17.680 --> 08:26.160]  a lot of people out of 183 million infected and i'll tell you this obviously more are infected
[08:26.160 --> 08:31.280]  right now than that if if this follows historical models just like dr patinic said this virus has
[08:31.280 --> 08:36.080]  been here probably for months there's been a lot of really bad pneumonia type stuff and and this
[08:36.080 --> 08:42.080]  virus is what's so dangerous about it is it it mutates so quickly and so many different ways
[08:42.080 --> 08:50.560]  and that's why there's fundamentally fear of it because it's so active and i'm not a medical
[08:50.560 --> 08:55.200]  doctor i'm reading what they're saying i'm watching i'm studying it and i think tucker carlson last
[08:55.200 --> 09:01.600]  night had a guest on a medical doctor who i think in three minutes shunned it up best but i'll get
[09:01.600 --> 09:12.560]  to that in a moment let me right now tell you what i do know the league of nations in the un and
[09:12.560 --> 09:18.720]  these systems were set up in the name of stopping wars and stopping the spread of infectious disease
[09:18.720 --> 09:23.120]  and coordinating during huge crises sounds great makes a lot of sense doesn't it except powerful
[09:23.120 --> 09:27.680]  corporations then use those bodies to pass international laws that benefit them and not
[09:27.680 --> 09:31.440]  the general public or anybody else and are very drachronian and make the robber barons
[09:31.440 --> 09:38.160]  of 120 years ago look like choir boys look like boy scouts look like the apostle paul
[09:40.320 --> 09:46.400]  they are just completely sociopathic on the good end and psychotic on the other i mean just you
[09:46.400 --> 09:53.040]  name it out of control think they're god think they're invincible get away with murder the most
[09:53.040 --> 09:56.640]  cold-blooded stuff you can imagine like bayer pharmaceutical this came out in the court trial
[09:56.640 --> 10:01.680]  saying we're like yeah we've infected about two million people we estimate with the factor rate
[10:01.680 --> 10:07.920]  with hepatitis abc and hiv and the head said screw them we don't need hemophiliacs we're doing
[10:07.920 --> 10:13.120]  them a favor yeah how about somebody walks up to you and jabs and ice picked through your
[10:13.120 --> 10:18.480]  eye i'm not saying do that but oh no that's a that's a ceo that's a that's a president that's a
[10:18.480 --> 10:24.320]  well you just killed a bunch of people jerk and it just goes on and on so i don't trust
[10:24.320 --> 10:29.840]  these people okay i know where these pharmaceutical companies came from i know who they are a bunch
[10:29.840 --> 10:37.840]  of mad scientists who recruit more mad scientists and i'll tell you it's a bunch of british and
[10:37.840 --> 10:44.000]  german mad scientists set this whole damn thing up don't blame germans don't blame brit's i'm just
[10:44.000 --> 10:53.440]  saying that's where patient zero of these lunatics came from and i'm down i'm no digressing here it
[10:53.440 --> 11:01.360]  is in summation they have a planetary government in in place the red phones for nuclear weapons
[11:01.360 --> 11:06.560]  earthquakes all that that makes sense but it always gets abused and they treat the public
[11:06.560 --> 11:13.200]  like idiots you give people garbage they become garbage you give them a high tech complex stratum
[11:13.200 --> 11:17.920]  of information they become more intelligent it's just a fact but we're fed the most dumbed down
[11:17.920 --> 11:25.840]  garbage to lower the communication systems but i digress what we know is that whether it's the
[11:25.840 --> 11:33.280]  russians or it's the chinese or the mexicans or the united states uh or the germans or the brits
[11:33.280 --> 11:43.280]  or the columbians or the kataris it's all the exact same propaganda the exact same statements
[11:43.280 --> 11:47.520]  and they're all in lockstep and i look back about a month they've been lined up together
[11:47.520 --> 11:54.240]  that's not normally done that way so this is a test of world government and a test of the
[11:54.240 --> 12:02.240]  international system for a giant communicable outbreak it's been preconditioned it's been
[12:02.240 --> 12:06.160]  pre-prepared but the netflix shows and the vaccines are already ready folks they just
[12:06.160 --> 12:10.800]  got to put it in a solution and again that's building the gates again and you add all that together
[12:12.080 --> 12:16.400]  we know this is staged does it mean it's not deadly does it mean it's not super deadly
[12:16.400 --> 12:22.240]  that doesn't mean we know how many are going to infect it nobody knows that but god but this is big
[12:24.400 --> 12:27.760]  i'm not sure exactly what's going on but it's staged
[12:27.760 --> 12:35.120]  it's like walking into a furniture store and there's a bowl of fruit on the table you're
[12:35.120 --> 12:39.440]  in a furniture store a at 50 feet away you're like that's plastic fruit just because you know
[12:39.440 --> 12:43.600]  you're in a you know in a furniture store you walk over and you can see it's plastic now do i
[12:43.600 --> 12:49.840]  know what type of plastic it is where it got made no i know it's plastic fruit this is plastic this
[12:49.840 --> 13:00.080]  is synthetic now within that statement do we know exactly what's going on no are the people
[13:00.080 --> 13:07.120]  dying absolutely is this a real tragedy yes but gut level and the way the chai comms are working
[13:07.120 --> 13:12.880]  with the un and the us and everybody else this is a pre-programmed global drill
[13:12.880 --> 13:20.240]  and they already knew this was out and going around killing people three or four months ago
[13:20.240 --> 13:25.760]  and they decided to go ahead and activate the drill or somebody released this on purpose to do it
[13:25.760 --> 13:33.120]  but either way this is all contrived and i don't think anybody can disagree with that if you just
[13:33.120 --> 13:42.080]  sit back same question how oh really are you a biologist are you a botanist how do you know
[13:42.080 --> 13:47.920]  that banana is plastic and i'm like you can see the damn things plastic your eye is so good that
[13:47.920 --> 13:54.480]  even the best fake fruit or best fake plants you just know they're not real well this is a
[13:54.480 --> 14:01.040]  ridiculous like a drawing of a banana it's so fake it's not even a plastic banana it just
[14:01.040 --> 14:07.200]  reaps of bs up one side and down the other with all the final icing to know it's fake
[14:07.200 --> 14:13.440]  that it's all coordinated like a ballet i mean this is like watching the top conductor
[14:14.240 --> 14:18.080]  and that's why people are so scared because they're looking at this and they're going away
[14:18.080 --> 14:22.480]  this doesn't look like anything we've seen in a response where the response is it's the end
[14:22.480 --> 14:28.320]  of the world but the pr is everything's fine that's what's scary so we're gonna open the
[14:28.320 --> 14:34.720]  phones up today and take massive calls i did have guests lined up for today but i had a moved
[14:34.720 --> 14:38.480]  Matt Bracken will be in in the fourth hour he's got a lot of interesting things to say
[14:38.480 --> 14:44.000]  but i'm gonna be here i think owens been super sick with some kind of respiratory issue uh he was
[14:44.000 --> 14:48.160]  in the dcj all from having a piece of tape over his mouth at the Capitol in this wonderfully free
[14:48.160 --> 14:53.680]  country uh and so he i think he should be back and owens tough i mean he barely got a bed two days
[14:53.680 --> 14:59.760]  ago with folks go check on him um but um it's a fan i went and checked on him so there is a lot
[14:59.760 --> 15:04.240]  going on here we're gonna be breaking it all down and i'm gonna play this report when we come back
[15:04.240 --> 15:09.840]  from Fox News i think in three minutes with Tucker Carlson it's i think the best summation
[15:09.840 --> 15:15.120]  you know Tucker you just are getting somebody that's smart and that has had a lot of experience in
[15:15.120 --> 15:20.320]  the world and who is now in a position he can finally do his own show i hated the old Tucker
[15:20.320 --> 15:26.400]  Carlson the one that had to sit there and put a little neocon libertarian you know padded on the
[15:26.400 --> 15:30.720]  head i wouldn't call the neocon but in a conservative world run by neocons he had to survive but now
[15:30.720 --> 15:34.800]  you see a guy who has his own show and does whatever the hell he wants which is a real rarity i can
[15:34.800 --> 15:38.720]  tell you he doesn't do it easily i know some of the behind the scenes not from him but from others
[15:39.440 --> 15:43.440]  well maybe from him too but the point is he gets persecuted a lot for just really
[15:43.440 --> 15:47.440]  seeing what he thinks and most of the time it turns out to be accurate doesn't it because it's
[15:47.440 --> 15:51.520]  common sense we have it the globalists don't because they're a bunch of mad scientists
[15:51.520 --> 15:54.960]  and they're the enemy of humanity they tell us they are we'll be right back stay with us

[20:52.160 --> 20:56.960]  seven seven seven eight nine alex eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine
[20:56.960 --> 21:02.000]  it's first-time callers long-time callers disagree agree we're having a big discussion about this
[21:03.200 --> 21:09.520]  virus and the unprecedented response i don't think you need me to tell you that they're
[21:09.520 --> 21:14.240]  shutting down slides from all over the world in and out of china i don't have to tell you that
[21:14.240 --> 21:21.360]  thailand has been honest and said that they can't contain it and that it's spreading out of control
[21:22.000 --> 21:26.480]  that's the type of government i would like to have a government that just tells me what's going on
[21:27.440 --> 21:32.160]  and that then i can get prepared or at least tell me what they think's going on
[21:34.320 --> 21:42.000]  and i got to tell you that's the big 64 trillion dollar question why is the united states of any
[21:42.000 --> 21:51.680]  major power the most sluggish to stop flights out of china coming to the us is it because they know
[21:51.680 --> 21:56.320]  the virus has already been all over the us which you know i don't even know why i held off on this
[21:57.440 --> 22:05.120]  but it's because i didn't have all the pieces yet and so i did want to tell you two days ago that
[22:05.120 --> 22:14.720]  individuals in and around the white house have stated to individuals that they know it's all over
[22:14.720 --> 22:19.040]  the us and it's escaped containment because it was already here before any containment could be
[22:19.040 --> 22:23.120]  attempted but they are going to start screening people to come in from china that show signs but
[22:23.120 --> 22:29.120]  it incubates so you don't know eight to ten days most people don't have any fever for eight to ten
[22:29.120 --> 22:36.880]  days you can be shedding it and no one knows you can get through your eyes i think that's
[22:36.880 --> 22:43.440]  really where the fear is at the end of the day that this is so easily transmittable we don't
[22:43.440 --> 22:47.840]  really know the real death rate of it that land studies too small better not be 18 percent that's
[22:47.840 --> 22:53.680]  biblical proportions of it is i bet it's less than one percent who knows but they know it is very
[22:53.680 --> 22:57.600]  communicable we know that now from independent labs because i'm not going to believe anything out of
[22:57.600 --> 23:04.240]  the united nations and trump doesn't totally run the cdc i i don't believe what the cdc says they
[23:04.240 --> 23:08.720]  tell you vaccines are safe and effective and then in their own internal cdc documents that came out
[23:08.720 --> 23:15.040]  in 2002 on abc news back when they still did their job sometimes that they had minutes that congress
[23:15.040 --> 23:19.440]  got where the head of the cdc said my god i'm going to tell my children don't vaccinate our
[23:19.440 --> 23:24.800]  grandchildren they'll kill us if they've learned we've brain damaged millions auto immune response
[23:24.800 --> 23:29.840]  blood on the brain you know if a honeybee stings you and you swell up you can die what do you
[23:29.840 --> 23:34.880]  hell do you think happens to a baby giving them freaking shots man it's not rocket science
[23:36.400 --> 23:41.920]  some people are violently allergic to the damn things that's what it is you know you're allergic
[23:41.920 --> 23:45.280]  to peanuts you don't be allergic to cat hair i'm allergic to cedar
[23:48.560 --> 23:51.840]  oh no there's nothing going on we're just gonna inject all this in your baby so
[23:51.840 --> 23:58.400]  we're gonna take your calls today eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine
[24:00.320 --> 24:04.080]  i want to hear from folks at their take or what they're seeing or what's happening to them in
[24:04.080 --> 24:10.960]  their families but i really think the best thing i could do is play this clip uh where
[24:10.960 --> 24:20.080]  tucker carlson had a medical doctor on a frequent cast of his show what is the coronavirus and why
[24:20.080 --> 24:25.680]  is it so deadly dr mark seagull knocks it out of the park here it is so we've cleared up that
[24:25.680 --> 24:32.160]  misconception what is the coronavirus how do you get it how serious is it what are the symptoms
[24:32.160 --> 24:36.000]  one man who knows is fox pent up and contributed dr mark seagull and he joins us today doctor thanks
[24:36.000 --> 24:43.520]  so much for coming on so describe if you would what it means to get the coronavirus the coronavirus
[24:43.520 --> 24:49.920]  is a virus in mammals different kinds of mammals and it goes from one species to another
[24:49.920 --> 24:55.520]  this particular strain and it's a single strand of genetic material that mutates all the time that
[24:55.520 --> 25:01.440]  changes all the time and that's why it can go from being the common cold to being quite deadly
[25:01.440 --> 25:06.400]  the way humans get it and we talked about this before is by being in close contact with animals
[25:06.400 --> 25:11.760]  and then it hops into humans and then it can start to accelerate and go from human to human the
[25:11.760 --> 25:18.480]  symptoms you get tucker our fever sore throat cough shortness of breath sounds like any respiratory
[25:18.480 --> 25:24.560]  virus right and that's the problem we don't know yet how deadly it is but it looks like
[25:25.120 --> 25:30.000]  because of all of the cases in china that weren't reported and i believe that there were a lot of
[25:30.000 --> 25:35.920]  mild cases that were never reported that it may not be as deadly as feared and over here in the
[25:35.920 --> 25:42.160]  united states the centers for disease control has done a fantastic job isolating those who have it
[25:42.160 --> 25:47.840]  checking those who came from wuhan including the 200 now getting off the plane in california today
[25:47.840 --> 25:53.680]  and every day that goes by without those people spreading it to other people the more relieved
[25:53.680 --> 25:59.760]  i am that maybe it's not as contagious as feared gosh i hope that's the case now some have died
[25:59.760 --> 26:05.040]  over a hundred according to the official chinese accounting of it how do they die without being
[26:05.040 --> 26:09.520]  morbid i think it's an important question what is it what kills you about the coronavirus very
[26:09.520 --> 26:14.240]  important question and like with sars which was the previous one that we're worried about because
[26:14.240 --> 26:19.600]  sars killed almost one out of ten people that have it it's usually pneumonia it's shortness of
[26:19.600 --> 26:25.200]  breath and cough and you develop pneumonia now the good news there is that almost everyone
[26:25.200 --> 26:31.600]  that has died from this so far has been elderly not all there was a young person a team that died
[26:31.600 --> 26:36.720]  from it tragically but most are elderly or have some kind of chronic condition where they're
[26:36.720 --> 26:44.320]  predisposed to this virus doing the worst so again it may be that it's not as deadly as feared
[26:44.320 --> 26:49.920]  what i'm disturbed mostly about is that over in china they don't seem to have done what we're
[26:49.920 --> 26:56.480]  doing over here isolating people seeing who they're in contact with yes making sure that we track
[26:56.480 --> 27:01.440]  it testing people for it that's how you contain it a vaccine is in the works by the way i spoke
[27:01.440 --> 27:08.160]  to dr. Fauci of the NIH last night about that but that's about a year away a year away it's
[27:08.160 --> 27:12.480]  it's about two or three months away from going into trials i'd say it's about a year away before
[27:12.480 --> 27:17.920]  we could actually use it in people but it looks promising we have to contain this with basic public
[27:17.920 --> 27:23.520]  health but i have to tell you the idea of people walking down the streets tucker with masks on
[27:23.520 --> 27:29.440]  is absurd because with five cases in the united states they shouldn't be thinking coronavirus
[27:29.440 --> 27:36.080]  they should be thinking flu which has infected 20 million this year so far 20 million versus five
[27:36.720 --> 27:39.680]  thank you for the perspective on that doctor great to see you tonight thanks tucker
[27:41.280 --> 27:47.040]  so minus the vaccine talk because people want to have a solution like you got a house fire you
[27:47.040 --> 27:54.640]  want a fire department minus that it's good to have the balance of saying compared to other things
[27:54.640 --> 28:00.160]  going on currently right now in the us many areas it's not a big deal so why is there this
[28:00.160 --> 28:05.120]  giant unprecedented response and that's the big question we're gonna be wargaming all day here
[28:05.120 --> 28:11.600]  together i don't want to make light of this because i have seen pneumonia it helped kill
[28:12.560 --> 28:18.400]  most of people i love i mean i started really getting down to brass tacks my grandmother died
[28:18.400 --> 28:24.640]  of pneumonia my uncle died of pneumonia my cousin died i mean i mean so many people you don't need
[28:24.640 --> 28:29.440]  me to tell you you've you've dealt with it that's what we said pneumonia is far more deadly than
[28:29.440 --> 28:35.120]  the flu and and the flu vaccines in their own studies don't protect you listen i can read the
[28:35.120 --> 28:43.600]  literature the art the uh the inserts that come with it if vaccines worked i'd be lined up around
[28:43.600 --> 28:50.160]  the block to get them think i want to die but they don't almost all the time they lower your immunity
[28:50.160 --> 28:54.720]  they screw you up and americans and others are living less than we used to we have the highest
[28:54.720 --> 29:02.240]  level of babies dying if you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs listen to me
[29:02.240 --> 29:07.600]  you don't know me and we'll never meet i had a problem like you once i drank and used to party
[29:07.600 --> 29:14.400]  a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life i realized i needed help to
[29:14.400 --> 29:20.560]  fix my problem before it totally destroyed me if you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem
[29:20.560 --> 29:26.400]  and you know you can't do it alone you need to call the national treatment advisors they'll

[31:21.280 --> 31:26.960]  the big tech censorship taking action against that in some other areas but trying to end the wars

[34:41.520 --> 34:46.560]  we've had a lot of problems we've been given all this great power and all these atheists and all
[34:46.560 --> 34:53.200]  these satanists and all these globalists who before didn't believe in god but as they see
[34:53.200 --> 34:58.480]  the technology and the artificial omnipresence and as they get down to the atoms and as they get
[34:58.480 --> 35:02.480]  down into the genetics and they get out of the universe and artificial force at least five times
[35:02.480 --> 35:07.760]  stronger of course it's five times stronger everything's in fives and threes is artificially
[35:07.760 --> 35:12.720]  holding this in place and they say oh it's a simulation that's the big thing in silicon
[35:12.720 --> 35:18.480]  valley and when they go take their drugs at burning man they come back and say there's a
[35:18.480 --> 35:23.840]  presser that's oppressed us this dimension we're gonna create a new reality and come with us
[35:25.360 --> 35:32.880]  heard of that before right read about that before he's all that's just a book yeah

[35:39.520 --> 35:44.720]  the good news is the devil's real because you know what that means it means god's real
[35:44.720 --> 35:48.960]  but i'm digressing i'ma stop preaching these are the times i preach
[35:52.080 --> 35:57.360]  the media is attacking us for conspiracy theories that means questioning
[35:58.960 --> 36:05.920]  you know info wars and natural news set a week before what the projected numbers would be by
[36:05.920 --> 36:12.560]  now and we're pretty much dead on so see mainstream media just wishes they were real boys and not
[36:12.560 --> 36:19.120]  wooden boys like Pinocchio they wish that they put their boots on in the morning and were the
[36:19.120 --> 36:23.600]  captains of their own ships but see they're not madrides they're not Tucker Carlson they're not
[36:23.600 --> 36:28.800]  Alex Jones and i'm sorry for them that they're not i want them to be real boys but you gotta
[36:28.800 --> 36:36.000]  have courage to become a real boy that's how that works see children understand that do adults
[36:36.000 --> 36:44.960]  understand that oh look the Wuhan coronavirus is an exciting opportunity for conspiracy theorist
[36:44.960 --> 36:50.880]  that means people that question the received knowledge especially when we don't know what
[36:50.880 --> 36:59.280]  the hell's going on and oh the worst part callers too oh oh you call the they let random people on
[36:59.280 --> 37:06.720]  the air and then millions hear them we can't allow that i mean that's not elitism that's that american
[37:06.720 --> 37:12.400]  system and we're not gonna put up with that okay see how that whoa you're all going bankrupt and
[37:14.720 --> 37:20.880]  who is it just gave up on you warren buffett told us that the sky's blue and that newspapers
[37:20.880 --> 37:25.840]  are a losing commodity right after newspapers assisted big tech in butchering free speech
[37:25.840 --> 37:31.520]  and butchering competition the globalists now say oh by the way now that you you know
[37:32.320 --> 37:37.520]  help us shut down all the competition now that you're not needed at all here's your pink slip
[37:38.240 --> 37:44.560]  get out and don't let the door hit you on the ass and and oh but everyone's work at the new
[37:44.560 --> 37:50.400]  orc times now all the failed they all go there and they don't get paid they're just given titles of
[37:50.400 --> 38:01.360]  senior this or something that titles like nobility but everybody hates you everybody
[38:01.360 --> 38:04.400]  despises mainstream corporate media because they're a joke
[38:09.440 --> 38:16.960]  nurse in germany charged with attempting to kill five babies she wonder why she got into
[38:16.960 --> 38:23.520]  nursing to play god so you gotta watch those people it's not that all the medical people are bad
[38:23.520 --> 38:29.520]  it's that there is a certain type and they tend to rise in the ranks because they're callous
[38:30.240 --> 38:34.960]  and they cover things up and that's how you get mad scientist like bill gates
[38:37.360 --> 38:41.840]  who comes from a long line of them he's the biggest serial killer on the planet in my view
[38:41.840 --> 38:47.920]  people say well you ought to watch your ass well i think i better not
[38:50.960 --> 38:57.840]  because i'm just a projectile fired by god at the enemy my job is to be destroyed
[38:59.120 --> 39:04.800]  upon impact and i think we're doing a really good job burning into the enemy aren't we
[39:05.680 --> 39:11.600]  and making sure when our kinetic energy fully expands itself there's a big giant flaming
[39:11.600 --> 39:21.600]  hole in the globalist underbelly so that's real that's not think tanks that's not dolled up crap
[39:21.600 --> 39:32.400]  and pr firms and teleprompters that's the soul endless eternal fathomless and not afraid to die
[39:32.400 --> 39:36.320]  because it isn't death those aren't words that's the truth
[39:36.320 --> 39:41.040]  next segment i'll go to your calls i'm gonna do this now
[39:42.960 --> 39:47.440]  i am very sad about this virus and very sad about the bio weapons and the things that
[39:47.440 --> 39:53.120]  are going on but it is an opportunity for people to take advantage of the products we have and do
[39:53.120 --> 39:57.440]  what's right and be self sufficient it's all about that just because i say you should go work
[39:57.440 --> 40:00.960]  out doesn't mean i'm perfect either just because i say you shouldn't eat trans fats doesn't mean i
[40:00.960 --> 40:04.480]  don't eat them sometimes just because i say hey you don't want to get too much sun you'll get skin
[40:04.480 --> 40:08.160]  cancer i mean i don't do it when i'm up here i'm talking to myself it's like i'm talking to you in
[40:08.160 --> 40:12.640]  fact this show is really me preaching it myself saying you need to be a better person but i'll
[40:12.640 --> 40:17.200]  tell you this i almost kicked myself in the ass last week when i'm like on the phone
[40:18.960 --> 40:22.000]  trying to wrangle even better deal for myself than what we sell the food at because that's
[40:22.000 --> 40:25.760]  a set price they're like yeah why don't you know everybody's selling out you should be promoting
[40:25.760 --> 40:30.400]  it you know you already have record high sales of food and i'm like i didn't pay attention to that
[40:30.400 --> 40:33.760]  because that's the marketing program around here is just really whatever i'm thinking about
[40:33.760 --> 40:38.560]  whenever i'm doing so let me walk right over here real quick for tv viewers ladies and gentlemen

[40:59.360 --> 41:03.760]  else is totally sold out but they will not tell you that and the reason i'm with my patreon supply
[41:03.760 --> 41:08.320]  is because they have high quality food that is very affordable beats almost all the competition
[41:08.320 --> 41:13.520]  in price beats them all for what you're paying for the quality and how good it tastes okay this is
[41:13.520 --> 41:17.520]  really good stuff for camping or you name it or to give the Salvation Army or give the local police
[41:17.520 --> 41:22.480]  department or fire department they've got folks that need it this is insurance you're going to be
[41:22.480 --> 41:28.160]  able to use and with inflation the way it's going that that's the real reason i was buying more food
[41:28.160 --> 41:33.200]  wasn't just the virus it was the economy and the stock market and just all of it a hedge in my bed
[41:33.200 --> 41:37.200]  getting even more food for here at the office we have enough food i don't know four five six

[50:03.760 --> 50:08.080]  we're going to get to that for you i saw senator blooming fall that's quarterbacking the lawsuits
[50:08.080 --> 50:14.880]  against us for hillary clinton that's on record he got up there and said we should censor rand paul
[50:16.480 --> 50:19.840]  i'm gonna cover everything we're gonna call us we should censor him because you can't say
[50:19.840 --> 50:25.360]  a whistleblower's name so in a trial you can't say who your accuser is blooming falls a lawyer
[50:25.360 --> 50:32.000]  and he's a damn liar again that's like saying two plus two does not hold for rand paul is
[50:32.000 --> 50:38.240]  bad he said it equals four we're like but it equals four shut up it's the inspector general
[50:38.240 --> 50:42.400]  can't say who a whistleblower is when it's in that process but when you give interviews the
[50:42.400 --> 50:47.280]  new york times and you put out this info and you get the president of the united states indicted
[50:49.760 --> 50:55.440]  the president doesn't get the face who said this this is a war against common sense by a bunch of
[50:55.440 --> 51:02.320]  dirty corrupt lawyers attempting to garrot new process in this country strangle it sweat its throat
[51:05.920 --> 51:10.560]  and now they're saying that they want rand paul's head
[51:14.320 --> 51:22.320]  and they're mad at paul because he says eric cirama who's just one of the people spouting bs
[51:22.320 --> 51:30.880]  the whistleblower is a cutout term for the globalist deep state liars that construct bs behind the
[51:30.880 --> 51:35.040]  wall of secrecy that's why i've almost gotten rid of nondisclosure stuff here that any business has
[51:35.040 --> 51:38.720]  or an impressive media company so people don't expose sources and things like that
[51:40.720 --> 51:46.000]  and because people use the nondisclosure to lie from behind oh i i can't tell you the horrible
[51:46.000 --> 51:50.480]  things we saw it's a nondisclosure you know jones swings off the chandeliers and you know
[51:50.480 --> 51:54.880]  that swastika shoes on i mean this is the type of stuff and you're just like why is it so outlandish
[51:54.880 --> 51:59.200]  because it's got to be people don't believe stuff it's not outlandish from the establishment but
[51:59.200 --> 52:05.920]  since it's like that's such a whopper that's crazy it's like saying a man can have babies it's just
[52:05.920 --> 52:10.880]  not true you'll be fired from most corporations or systems if you don't agree with okay i said i go
[52:10.880 --> 52:17.440]  to your calls but that's the type of stuff that's going on right now and that's the type of stuff
[52:17.440 --> 52:23.280]  the democrats are doing it is outlandish and now of course he got caught lying we have that clip too
[52:23.280 --> 52:30.000]  coming up don't get me started on shift man he said i don't know who the whistleblower is earlier
[52:30.000 --> 52:35.840]  he said he did he's a complete liar under oath lying in the senate roger stone set to go to
[52:35.840 --> 52:38.640]  prison on february 20th the sentencing
[52:38.640 --> 52:47.120]  and this guy sits up there he's got a pinocchio nose that goes around the world

[53:35.920 --> 53:38.880]  pentagon you name it they're big listeners we're the only people there are a lot of private
[53:38.880 --> 53:43.120]  label their products and in fact we've made new products this was made with them and my dad who's

[54:31.920 --> 54:35.440]  feeling the difference as well that's a good front line and that's what i'm personally doing it's what
[54:35.440 --> 54:40.160]  my children are personally doing and uh it's why so many other folks are sick and we're not knock on
[54:40.160 --> 54:45.120]  wood so the good lord keeps me in the fight that's the real reason i'm not sick but god helps those
[54:45.120 --> 54:50.640]  that helps themselves honor s thompson said you know trust in god pray to god but row away from the
[54:50.640 --> 54:56.400]  rocks the better one sings trust in god tiger camel you know hey we trust in god but god gave
[54:56.400 --> 55:01.520]  me the sense to tie that camel up so if you don't tie that you've got to do the basics and god will
[55:01.520 --> 55:05.360]  take you the rest of the way that's been my experience and the older i get the more i learn
[55:05.360 --> 55:10.400]  man the stuff in this bible it's all true some people don't know how to read it because they
[55:10.400 --> 55:15.440]  don't have the ability to read it god just doesn't give the average person the ability to read the
[55:15.440 --> 55:21.120]  bible and i would always hear that go what i mean once i found i was like whoa i mean once you do
[55:21.120 --> 55:26.400]  have that then it's totally different and you get how it begins in a progression as man learns and
[55:26.400 --> 55:32.160]  is at those levels as well it's very sophisticated and i'm gonna stop right there i said i'd go to
[55:32.160 --> 55:38.560]  your calls i didn't do it um you can feel the energy it's off the charts right now something
[55:38.560 --> 55:44.000]  big is afoot something big is moving and the coordinated governmental systems all working
[55:44.000 --> 55:49.440]  together when i watch the russian propaganda news and all information is propaganda the
[55:49.440 --> 55:54.560]  propaganda dirty word there's black propaganda there's gray propaganda there's white propaganda
[55:54.560 --> 56:00.080]  that that's if you want to use those definitions black propaganda saying uh alex jones lost a
[56:00.080 --> 56:04.560]  lawsuit for a book titled nobody died at sandy hook didn't write the book not in the book total
[56:04.560 --> 56:11.760]  hoax ap that's black propaganda white propaganda is saying i sure love my mama and boy she sure
[56:11.760 --> 56:17.360]  cooks really good christmas dinner which is true but i had her on the shoulder and thank her for it
[56:17.360 --> 56:22.560]  she likes that and she's really a great cook makes the best roles that's true but it's proper means
[56:22.560 --> 56:27.760]  propagating she means what you're proselytizing propaganda comes out of proselytizing a preacher
[56:27.760 --> 56:32.240]  proselytizes the preacher tells you what they believe what they stand for you know who they are
[56:32.240 --> 56:38.160]  there and then they're promoting a certain worldview so you've got to practice what you preach as well
[56:38.160 --> 56:44.640]  and i practice what i preach ladies and gentlemen i practice it religiously because the more i practice
[56:44.640 --> 56:50.400]  it and the more i do what god wants me to do the better everything gets the stronger i get the more
[56:50.400 --> 56:57.440]  intense my vision gets the more manly i become it's incredible to get closer to god and that's
[56:57.440 --> 57:04.000]  why the enemy's so fallen and look like windup toy animatrons because these are slaves they have
[57:04.000 --> 57:08.640]  turned them they're not physical slaves some people they're physical slaves are the strongest
[57:08.640 --> 57:13.280]  because they know they've been captured and are in a system that's oppressing them but when you
[57:13.280 --> 57:18.080]  don't know it and you think you want the system you think you want hollywood and want the power of
[57:18.080 --> 57:24.160]  the system and you go to it you're like a fly caught in a spider's web and so you're worse than a
[57:24.160 --> 57:30.640]  slave you're a delusional fool who's had their soul stolen and that's why they laugh and fly over
[57:30.640 --> 57:36.320]  country and but how dumb the white people are on singing in because they reduced themselves to black

[1:04:14.800 --> 1:04:21.200]  and pray uh that this will all come crashing down on them and it is it is it's just taking a while
[1:04:21.200 --> 1:04:25.840]  it's you know it's it's like when you drain the swamp you're gonna have a bunch of nasty
[1:04:25.840 --> 1:04:30.080]  soft swamp creatures flopping around gasping for air and that's that's what we're seeing right now
[1:04:30.080 --> 1:04:37.680]  uh trump needs to stay focused on the tasks at hand and just i really i i gotta say i've
[1:04:37.680 --> 1:04:43.360]  given him a lot of credit when he does uh kind of just ignore what's going on with the impeachment
[1:04:43.360 --> 1:04:47.440]  this little bit of time that he is able to do that like the march for life for instance
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:52.880]  he needs to know i love trump i love trump it's like want your own right arm to be more strong
[1:04:52.880 --> 1:04:58.560]  though you need to piss like get these people off me trump i would thank you for everything you've
[1:04:58.560 --> 1:05:04.000]  done for the info war but i know you're like me you don't want my thanks you want victory over the
[1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:08.080]  globalist and these devil worship and child molesters and you want them off your back and off

[1:05:13.200 --> 1:05:20.640]  and it's why m4s has been delivering time and time again when it's clutch time to focus the people
[1:05:20.640 --> 1:05:26.960]  on taking action against the globalist because i'm committed to a future for humanity and i know you

[1:06:21.040 --> 1:06:26.640]  now as best i can let's go ahead and talk to lile then dug and others lile thanks for holding
[1:06:26.640 --> 1:06:34.960]  from idaho welcome hey alex how you doing bud man i tell you i am charged up like a high power
[1:06:34.960 --> 1:06:43.680]  attention bar right now well you know i we must live in parallel universes because in terms of the
[1:06:43.680 --> 1:06:50.720]  scorcher's policy we can get so bogged down in the minutiae of a lot of this crap that uh you
[1:06:50.720 --> 1:06:56.560]  know it's just want to go splash and burn but for me for the macro view i mean first of all what you
[1:06:56.560 --> 1:07:03.200]  were talking about earlier is that uh you know this is a war against good and evil and i encourage
[1:07:03.200 --> 1:07:09.600]  all our listeners and i do myself three to fission six ten through eighteen every day putting on the
[1:07:09.600 --> 1:07:16.720]  armor of god because that's really where excuse me where we get our power from and in terms of
[1:07:18.080 --> 1:07:23.440]  you know what's going on with the virus and and kind of the the the broad view i've been
[1:07:23.440 --> 1:07:28.880]  listening to uh uh dr steve and mike and all you guys the past few days because i've been working
[1:07:28.880 --> 1:07:33.920]  in uh i'm an oil field worker in the rocky mountains fellas and you guys as i'm roaming
[1:07:33.920 --> 1:07:40.960]  around location doing stuff and uh i'm i'm kind of a dodge whether this was mistakenly let out
[1:07:40.960 --> 1:07:48.320]  early or not uh that's in question but mike adams is right most of the time he thinks it was about
[1:07:48.320 --> 1:07:52.480]  it is a bio weapon it's obviously been engineered but he thinks it did escape the chinese have a
[1:07:52.480 --> 1:08:00.560]  big history of letting the stuff out indeed and and so you know this in terms of once again the
[1:08:00.560 --> 1:08:10.160]  macro view this kind of uh kind of sets up on a societal on a global level to allow these monsters
[1:08:10.160 --> 1:08:16.480]  like gates or whatever to roll out these vaccines in the future with live viruses with impunity
[1:08:16.480 --> 1:08:23.520]  um you know and and i think that whether this was intentional or not i think
[1:08:23.520 --> 1:08:29.520]  long term that's one of the areas they're going and then secondly the only point i wanted to make
[1:08:29.520 --> 1:08:39.360]  was i think an added bonus for these uh monsters is that we're already as telente pointed out many
[1:08:39.360 --> 1:08:44.640]  times we're in a global economic slowdown we've kind of been insulated from it because of qe
[1:08:44.640 --> 1:08:49.440]  five or six oh yeah they're totally inflationary but it's like using a defibrillator on somebody
[1:08:49.440 --> 1:08:53.600]  i don't think trump has any other choice people can academically say he's wrong to do it it's the
[1:08:53.600 --> 1:08:58.480]  world we're in there's there's a global devaluation happening we have to make sure the dollar is on
[1:08:58.480 --> 1:09:03.040]  top when all these others go down and i'm not saying i like that but let me tell you i don't
[1:09:03.040 --> 1:09:10.080]  want my kids starving to death and a freaking civil war oh indeed and you know it so i think
[1:09:10.080 --> 1:09:18.000]  one of the added benefits for the for the globalists in this whole set of events is that uh they want
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:25.440]  to see our economy impacted to the point where it will somehow affect and that's the answer trump's
[1:09:25.440 --> 1:09:30.720]  not responding and hasn't blocked the flights yet because he doesn't want them to say he's the one
[1:09:30.720 --> 1:09:34.640]  that caused the panic and he thinks they're trying to set him up with this virus but then i see the
[1:09:34.640 --> 1:09:41.040]  coordinated systems from every major companies i mean usually company and that's what we are russia
[1:09:41.920 --> 1:09:48.000]  is locked step with this coronavirus propaganda whether it's true or not they're locked step
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:51.680]  well that means some emergency system has been activated where they're all going off a central
[1:09:51.680 --> 1:09:56.320]  script that only happens when they activate the global governance a global pandemic emergency
[1:09:56.320 --> 1:10:00.400]  systems they admit they have they're just not telling folks has been activated so that tells me
[1:10:00.400 --> 1:10:05.280]  that we're in world government right now i appreciate your call and that's really the big announcement here
[1:10:05.280 --> 1:10:14.480]  is we're in world government right now you can say well that's that's the reason we're in a crisis
[1:10:14.480 --> 1:10:21.360]  yeah yeah but the same world government says no borders no walls no usa at all think about that
[1:10:21.360 --> 1:10:27.760]  it's borders that like cells have a membrane or plant cells have a wall they're there for a reason
[1:10:27.760 --> 1:10:36.000]  and they're trying to take away that simple thing like walls make good neighbors fences make good
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:42.800]  neighbors because you know what there's a million reasons you got a fence it's not that you hate your
[1:10:42.800 --> 1:10:49.280]  neighbor you have privacy maybe you want to piss on the flowers in your backyard or maybe maybe
[1:10:49.280 --> 1:10:54.720]  you're arguing with your wife or maybe you know you that's why we have this so we have who we are
[1:10:54.720 --> 1:11:00.640]  and we want to go out in public we do it that's why everything in the universe has its nest it's
[1:11:00.640 --> 1:11:05.600]  why clownfish go back in the coral and come back out they they want their little place and the
[1:11:05.600 --> 1:11:10.560]  system's telling us you don't get that privacy it's that individualism and i know i'm stating
[1:11:10.560 --> 1:11:15.440]  super obvious things here but that's what they're assaulting they're assaulting that
[1:11:15.440 --> 1:11:17.440]  yeah
[1:11:23.760 --> 1:11:29.520]  let's go ahead and go to johnny and denmark regular caller always makes great points that
[1:11:29.520 --> 1:11:33.440]  will go to doug's room and others go ahead johnny what's on your mind right now with this coronavirus
[1:11:34.720 --> 1:11:40.880]  yeah hi again i was um yes third time i'm talking to you it's a pleasure and uh my uh
[1:11:40.880 --> 1:11:50.000]  compliments to your uh guesthouse uh all of them uh doing a great job on tom pappard and and and uh
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:58.560]  harrison's you mean emperor pappard yeah that's right um yeah i don't know if you listened uh to
[1:11:58.560 --> 1:12:04.880]  the uh my call in the at the war room uh yesterday but i was making the point that um first of all
[1:12:04.880 --> 1:12:11.680]  the analysis on info wars of the coronavirus uh spread is is light years ahead of what's in the
[1:12:12.480 --> 1:12:19.680]  msm uh mainstream media which isn't saying much but in this case it is um because it's it's very
[1:12:19.680 --> 1:12:26.560]  interesting and i'm i and it's to your credit that you brought on not straw men but iron men for
[1:12:26.560 --> 1:12:31.680]  both cases you know mike adams for the case so this this is something we need to worry about
[1:12:31.680 --> 1:12:36.320]  and c pat cenic for the case is of this is something we don't need to worry about they're
[1:12:36.320 --> 1:12:40.960]  both very intelligent very qualified people and i can see why each of them thinks that they're
[1:12:40.960 --> 1:12:46.320]  right relative to the other and again we're not getting some corporate order you watch cnn it's
[1:12:46.320 --> 1:12:50.640]  all everyone agrees because they're told i don't know what's going on exactly so i'm gonna have
[1:12:50.640 --> 1:12:57.520]  different people on just like i'm having callers i really want to hear what you think yeah again
[1:12:57.520 --> 1:13:01.680]  that's i as i said that's your credit i really appreciate that and you know what keeps me on
[1:13:01.680 --> 1:13:06.400]  about 10 hours a day watching it well thanks for putting up with us but that's the way everything
[1:13:06.400 --> 1:13:10.800]  used to be everything is just a free for all that's what we should have a free for all and
[1:13:10.800 --> 1:13:15.840]  then figure it out together that's how we figure stuff out right and here's what i figured out
[1:13:15.840 --> 1:13:24.240]  um mike adams makes a very good case i mean he may be uh in terms of people except maybe for people
[1:13:24.240 --> 1:13:29.280]  with esoteric information who have been spreading this thing the world's leading expert on the
[1:13:29.280 --> 1:13:35.840]  literature that's out there about that his analysis is superb oh he does work 15 to 18 hours a day
[1:13:36.800 --> 1:13:41.200]  yeah i mean not only this but i mean to the fact that he's that he's uh he speaks full in chinese
[1:13:41.200 --> 1:13:46.400]  and he has connections in china and you know read the land said oh by the way it's 15 percent uh
[1:13:46.400 --> 1:13:51.360]  not 18 percent i know i i just kind of like spread rate 18 percent i'm sorry i get things wrong
[1:13:51.360 --> 1:13:57.120]  um yeah 15 percent of the 83 percent so it's 12 and a half percent of the total population if
[1:13:57.120 --> 1:14:03.120]  that's the case but as you repeatedly pointed out um that you know the sample size is small
[1:14:03.120 --> 1:14:08.800]  and um so mike though did a very good job of covering uh the the literature is out there
[1:14:08.800 --> 1:14:13.520]  in a very academic what do you think of what uh pacenic was saying i mean he still works with
[1:14:13.520 --> 1:14:17.200]  the government so he'll say a lot of things when he thinks it's importantly disagrees with the
[1:14:17.200 --> 1:14:20.720]  government he'll come and attack the government and i respect that but when he agrees he will
[1:14:20.720 --> 1:14:27.760]  then parrot the line and i think we saw that happening yesterday um not sure about that i don't
[1:14:27.760 --> 1:14:31.760]  mean that meanly either i'm saying when he disagrees with it he will disagree with things
[1:14:31.760 --> 1:14:35.440]  and he's very bold but when he agrees with something he'll he'll proselytize it nothing's
[1:14:35.440 --> 1:14:42.320]  what we were seeing yesterday yeah i i think the thing with speed is he doesn't have as much specific
[1:14:42.320 --> 1:14:48.080]  knowledge about this particular coronavirus maybe about coronavirus which is generally
[1:14:48.080 --> 1:14:54.960]  what about this coronavirus mike just trumps him in terms of knowledge however um the problem is
[1:14:54.960 --> 1:15:01.040]  it's an epistemological problem sure based on the you're the best um official literature that's
[1:15:01.040 --> 1:15:06.480]  out there mike has done the best analysis and and maybe taken in the most information however
[1:15:06.480 --> 1:15:12.240]  steve's point though i don't think he articulated it so well as i mentioned uh to harrison yesterday
[1:15:12.240 --> 1:15:17.680]  is that he's the old gunslinger he's seen all this before and i'd like to make a parallel as i did
[1:15:17.680 --> 1:15:26.560]  yesterday and also the day before on the war room to the aides virus um it came out it was uh i'm
[1:15:26.560 --> 1:15:30.560]  old enough to remember i'm 55 and a half or eight years old remember because of info wars products
[1:15:30.560 --> 1:15:36.160]  i get large that i don't sound it but i am haven't been sick in more than 14 years since at least as
[1:15:36.160 --> 1:15:41.840]  early as 2005 um so you know i'm i'm yeah i'm in very good health and and and actually that's one
[1:15:41.840 --> 1:15:46.480]  of the point uh the good news for the average person is don't worry too much about it regardless

[1:20:37.520 --> 1:20:41.360]  worlds who don't want a global pandemic to wipe out the world's population
[1:20:42.960 --> 1:20:46.160]  who believe in our species and believe in god believe in our children
[1:20:48.240 --> 1:20:52.000]  now there's so much on the trial it's it's really heating up and later in the next hour
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:56.240]  i'm going to get to it they're calling for rand paul's arrest on tv senators are calling for him
[1:20:56.240 --> 1:21:03.040]  to get in trouble for saying the name of the godlike um whistleblower because they can't say
[1:21:03.040 --> 1:21:07.760]  you coordinated with eric siramela didn't you because shifts already said he didn't even though
[1:21:07.760 --> 1:21:14.800]  earlier he said he did i mean they're caught in serious crimes okay i mean normally if this
[1:21:14.800 --> 1:21:19.680]  virus thing wasn't so big i'd be all over this but we're gonna get to it next hour i i want to
[1:21:19.680 --> 1:21:24.640]  at least get to this first bank of calls but the backdrop is really that
[1:21:26.560 --> 1:21:31.360]  a bunch of lying out of control crazy mad scientists with a bunch of corrupt lawyers
[1:21:31.360 --> 1:21:36.160]  working for them who are trying to invert reality and train us to accept total disinformation it's
[1:21:36.160 --> 1:21:40.560]  just not working and they're getting more desperate and they're trying their old tricks they're just
[1:21:40.560 --> 1:21:46.640]  turning the volume up and it's not making people submit to them it's driving people into a rage
[1:21:46.640 --> 1:21:52.240]  and maybe that's what they want is to get violence going because they know they can't win politically
[1:21:52.240 --> 1:21:56.320]  regardless they're gonna lose it might not be very comfortable for those of us the tip of the
[1:21:56.320 --> 1:22:04.160]  spear in this process but that pain kind of feels good doesn't it we're running into these people
[1:22:04.160 --> 1:22:10.480]  we're colliding we're banging heads believe me they're hurting a lot worse so that's i was never
[1:22:10.480 --> 1:22:16.160]  into masochism but now i am i i finally get the religion of that not physical pain but spiritual
[1:22:16.160 --> 1:22:22.080]  because it's literally what animates us it's what makes us rise the occasion and it's what
[1:22:22.880 --> 1:22:28.560]  fuels the resistance and to see humanity awaken out of the coma is a beautiful thing to see those
[1:22:28.560 --> 1:22:32.800]  still in the coma like zombies walking around is very very sad we need to get them out of the
[1:22:32.800 --> 1:22:38.880]  trance we need humanity to awaken that's the answer but the backdrop is the globalists
[1:22:38.880 --> 1:22:43.760]  are everywhere saying humans are bad get rid of us need to wipe out humanity we need a super virus
[1:22:43.760 --> 1:22:48.560]  that's everywhere in pop culture now back when i made in game it wasn't i was like look at this
[1:22:48.560 --> 1:22:52.720]  transcript in this document there's their statement here and this is really scary isn't it the world
[1:22:52.720 --> 1:22:59.760]  leaders want to kill us and set up this new system now they're like kill yourselves it's a liberal
[1:22:59.760 --> 1:23:04.480]  don't have children a little bit like we have like six kids and you know jumbo helicopters and jets
[1:23:05.200 --> 1:23:10.960]  those are the people hyping up all the viruses and patenting the corona virus and spurring around
[1:23:10.960 --> 1:23:15.520]  casting themselves as the savior bill gates with a netflix show that just came out last week
[1:23:15.520 --> 1:23:21.440]  two weeks ago about the global end of humanity and mass death of an eel sabus with a shot because
[1:23:21.440 --> 1:23:27.760]  he wants you to metaphysically accept it and my name is the contractor i moved in next door would

[1:23:41.200 --> 1:23:48.160]  liking my darling i mean they need you to take your kids into them and just like in every culture
[1:23:48.160 --> 1:23:52.560]  you had to bring your children to the high priest so they could gut them or throw them into a furnace
[1:23:54.480 --> 1:23:55.280]  it's back again

[1:25:35.760 --> 1:25:41.280]  they think they're getting ahead because they don't care they think not caring's a value they
[1:25:41.280 --> 1:25:45.200]  don't understand caring is like lifting weights it makes you stronger they just don't get it
[1:25:45.200 --> 1:25:51.840]  yeah they think empathy is painful because it is it is painful but but that's that's
[1:25:51.840 --> 1:26:00.080]  enslavement leaving the body right right well um you know i was in the military i am a veteran
[1:26:00.080 --> 1:26:07.280]  and i also worked for a major aerospace company back in the 80s and i and myself were the first
[1:26:07.280 --> 1:26:17.120]  two people to ever sue for fraud a major aerospace company and we were on 60 minutes we were on 2020
[1:26:17.680 --> 1:26:23.600]  and after everything was said and done and i mean we we got them we got with so much evidence you
[1:26:23.600 --> 1:26:29.680]  know falsifying tests and bubble finder was one of the most lethal bombs there was at the time
[1:26:30.720 --> 1:26:33.520]  i was not the guy i remember this tell folks the case so they can look i should have you
[1:26:33.520 --> 1:26:40.560]  on as a guest tell folks the case it was the mx missile and northrop made the mx missile we made

[1:26:56.720 --> 1:27:01.760]  it was fake missiles in the in the in the silo sorry start over oh yeah there was all
[1:27:01.760 --> 1:27:08.480]  it they falsified test um the job that i had i walked around every department i was um
[1:27:09.440 --> 1:27:14.080]  in a kind of job that took me everywhere so i got to talk to a lot of people and for folks that
[1:27:14.080 --> 1:27:20.320]  don't know that was the big reagan air uh intercontinental ballistic missile yes it was yep
[1:27:21.280 --> 1:27:27.200]  so i could go on and on with that but i will i will talk more about that in another time but
[1:27:27.200 --> 1:27:32.800]  what i do want to talk to you about is that because of all the fraud that i've seen in my life i i know
[1:27:32.800 --> 1:27:40.160]  what the government does and how they act and how they're liars and how they don't care it's all
[1:27:40.160 --> 1:27:46.800]  about money it's all about power so we know that um i live in florida and i'm close to all the

[1:28:12.800 --> 1:28:16.800]  my gut i always follow it now and i i think this is something big i don't know if it's going to be
[1:28:16.800 --> 1:28:20.960]  the economic collapse it causes i don't know there's something else out there but i fundamentally
[1:28:20.960 --> 1:28:27.440]  am concerned as well and i think everybody is stay there don't hang up i want to hear more from you
[1:28:27.440 --> 1:28:30.640]  what incredible listeners that's why we got to give each caller time here because they're just

[1:33:17.520 --> 1:33:22.160]  for the president of the united states to block flights
[1:33:24.400 --> 1:33:31.280]  from china into the united states but trump is really a very practical person he had neurotic
[1:33:31.280 --> 1:33:38.560]  ocb level won't do something if it's too late and that's really the truth the virus is all over
[1:33:38.560 --> 1:33:45.680]  the planet so the question is why are they acting like it's so deadly maybe it is i'll tell you one
[1:33:45.680 --> 1:33:51.600]  thing we're going to find out aren't we it's kind of like i'm a child growing up that's a lot of
[1:33:51.600 --> 1:33:55.600]  potential wonder what they're going to be one what they're going to do there's something about that
[1:33:55.600 --> 1:34:01.280]  kid other times you kind of know what's going to happen with the child don't you not a lot of
[1:34:01.280 --> 1:34:05.120]  potential but sometimes they are major sometimes they sometimes the child you thought was going to
[1:34:05.120 --> 1:34:09.440]  be the golden child turns out to be the disappointment the child you thought wasn't going to have the
[1:34:09.440 --> 1:34:14.960]  potential had all the potential well this virus is a bad son it's not good is it we've got to ask
[1:34:14.960 --> 1:34:19.360]  ourselves how bad is it going to get why are they responding like this what's really going on i have
[1:34:19.360 --> 1:34:24.640]  some good news uh here in a moment the powerful video that's on info wars dot com and news wars
[1:34:24.640 --> 1:34:28.800]  dot com that needs to be shared around and i'll just leave it at that but i'm finishing up with a
[1:34:28.800 --> 1:34:34.480]  penny uh who's saying she was an mx uh missile whistleblower i remember all that penny i think i
[1:34:34.480 --> 1:34:38.880]  remember even you on the news going from my memory because things back then are almost
[1:34:38.880 --> 1:34:42.480]  photographic the things i see now i don't have photographic anymore but old stuff i pretty much
[1:34:42.480 --> 1:34:47.120]  do but that's amazing but but but but saying what you're seeing in florida and why you're concerned
[1:34:48.880 --> 1:34:56.160]  yeah um you know there's i i listened to the show yesterday and you had pachanica on you had
[1:34:56.160 --> 1:35:02.400]  mike adams right and um i was listening to everything everybody was saying and i i just don't
[1:35:02.400 --> 1:35:09.200]  know what to think and i want to go to university studios well i have a ticket with my adult daughter
[1:35:09.200 --> 1:35:16.000]  and we were going to go as a christmas present to me actually and we're just thinking should we go or
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:22.880]  not i don't think you've got to worry of course you have one person's out of a job it's a depression
[1:35:22.880 --> 1:35:26.720]  for them but if you're out of a job you know it's a depression but it's not it's a recession
[1:35:26.720 --> 1:35:31.760]  it's the same thing i don't think the virus has spread that widely other than china at this point
[1:35:31.760 --> 1:35:36.000]  i mean it's already out there there's a lot of other stuff out there as well and so i think driving
[1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:42.000]  your card to universal to be more dangerous than you going there uh but i if you saw chinese who
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:45.840]  speak chinese and are coughing or you know and i would definitely go the other direction but
[1:35:47.040 --> 1:35:52.080]  i personally uh was not going to go on a short vacation just because of this the more i think
[1:35:52.080 --> 1:35:56.880]  about i think i will because it's going to take a few more weeks for it to build up other than a
[1:35:56.880 --> 1:36:02.560]  plunge in the economy other than other unforeseen things but i don't have all the answers i don't
[1:36:02.560 --> 1:36:06.320]  know and so i'm kind of on the fence about was i going to go on this vacation i mean already
[1:36:06.320 --> 1:36:10.320]  there's so much news i'm bringing the crew with me now it's for like part of a week just so i'll
[1:36:10.320 --> 1:36:14.720]  i'll do the show now every day uh because i need to recharge a little bit before we go into the full
[1:36:14.720 --> 1:36:18.480]  campaign mode and work seven days a week and i'm like making excuses for going on a vacation
[1:36:19.280 --> 1:36:24.720]  i've canceled like four vacations my wife is really sick of it but uh i promised her and and the
[1:36:24.720 --> 1:36:30.800]  baby and she's almost three the other children will be in school stay with my parents um that uh
[1:36:30.800 --> 1:36:35.040]  it was i'm i'm digressing thank you penny and i'll publicate her name and number is i want to
[1:36:35.040 --> 1:36:45.280]  get her on as a guest if she will and i think penny is emblematic of all of us i mean this is a huge
[1:36:45.280 --> 1:36:50.640]  response but they're saying it's no big deal and everybody else is canceling flights out of china
[1:36:51.360 --> 1:36:57.680]  to their country but not trump so that's the big blinking red light what does that mean
[1:36:57.680 --> 1:37:03.680]  and in my view what does it mean that the propaganda is also unified russia is saying exactly what
[1:37:03.680 --> 1:37:10.160]  china and the u.s and everybody else are saying they're lockstep russia has i should have added
[1:37:10.160 --> 1:37:15.440]  close this entire 2600 mile border with china time to shut down travel between china and the
[1:37:15.440 --> 1:37:20.480]  u.s that's what senator tom cotton said who's a very smart senator i'm always impressed when i
[1:37:20.480 --> 1:37:26.000]  watch him in um senate hearings actually knowing what he's talking about and so yeah that that's
[1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:35.760]  common sense though so i'm a big trump a file as everybody knows but i i'm sure the orange one
[1:37:35.760 --> 1:37:41.280]  has some reason for this but i guess we got to just sit here and see it materialize but i mean i
[1:37:41.280 --> 1:37:45.760]  know it is they don't want to panic the markets so it's kind of redundant um let's give them some
[1:37:45.760 --> 1:37:51.600]  good news and back to your calls they're going to celebrate coming up in a few days of the
[1:37:51.600 --> 1:37:56.480]  brexit party paul watson's going to be there with Nigel forage and others i'm not bragging for paul
[1:37:56.480 --> 1:38:00.880]  that paul's it's kind of cools in the inner circle of that revolutionary group it's like paul knows
[1:38:00.880 --> 1:38:05.440]  doors washington because our revolution here came out of england people came here from england
[1:38:05.440 --> 1:38:10.240]  and scotland and ireland and germany and and the netherlands and other places to get away from
[1:38:10.240 --> 1:38:15.360]  oppression and of course we set it back up here as well we're not perfect but we were trying at least
[1:38:15.360 --> 1:38:22.560]  one nation so we had some better things than other nations and the eu is a tyranny they're not
[1:38:22.560 --> 1:38:26.960]  undemocratic they're anti-democratic and that's a perfect way of saying it they're authoritarian by
[1:38:26.960 --> 1:38:33.680]  design they didn't just slouch towards corruption they want it they want the classic evil real mccoy
[1:38:35.280 --> 1:38:38.880]  grim reaper of civilizations i mean they're bad dudes that have just turned over to evil
[1:38:38.880 --> 1:38:44.080]  because it's easier to be like that just not care about anybody except you die inside but for these
[1:38:44.080 --> 1:38:51.040]  zombies or these undead whose souls are vampiric their bodies die but they are vampires they can't
[1:38:51.040 --> 1:38:56.240]  see that because they can't see the light see the metaphor the light destroys them because they've
[1:38:56.240 --> 1:39:01.760]  already turned themselves over to darkness and so he just lays it out and by the way last week
[1:39:01.760 --> 1:39:07.120]  they banned having your flags in the EU parliament the EU parliament's ceremonial but it didn't
[1:39:07.120 --> 1:39:11.920]  matter it became the bully pulpit to expose the whole authoritarian new soviet union that it is
[1:39:11.920 --> 1:39:17.120]  literally hiring the former soviet chiefs to run it exhibiting themselves from taxes that they put
[1:39:17.120 --> 1:39:22.320]  on the people i mean just classic over-the-top stuff you just can't even it's just like what
[1:39:22.320 --> 1:39:28.000]  they're doing that so they said we're banning EU sports teams having nationalist names they
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:34.480]  gave five years to change their names that was last year now they have said that you will not
[1:39:34.480 --> 1:39:40.160]  have flags and the german federal council passes bill giving three years in prison
[1:39:40.160 --> 1:39:44.880]  for denigrating the EU flag that's just out so
[1:39:48.880 --> 1:39:53.200]  this is dangerous so Nigel Farage went in there when they banned the flags and they they
[1:39:53.200 --> 1:39:59.920]  waved them so so let's hear what he just had to say here it is and i can promise you both in
[1:39:59.920 --> 1:40:08.400]  u kip and indeed in the brexit party we love europe we just hate the european union it's as simple
[1:40:08.400 --> 1:40:16.320]  as that so i'm hoping i'm hoping this begins the end of this project it's a bad project
[1:40:16.320 --> 1:40:23.200]  it isn't just undemocratic it's anti-democratic and it puts in that front row it gives people
[1:40:23.200 --> 1:40:30.480]  power without accountability people who cannot be held to account by the electorate and that is an
[1:40:30.480 --> 1:40:37.200]  unacceptable structure indeed there's an historic battle going on now across the west in europe
[1:40:37.200 --> 1:40:45.920]  america and elsewhere it is globalism against populism and you may loathe populism but i said
[1:40:45.920 --> 1:40:54.080]  you a funny thing it's becoming very popular and it has great benefits no more financial
[1:40:54.080 --> 1:41:00.880]  contributions no more european court of justice no more common fisheries policy no more being
[1:41:00.880 --> 1:41:10.320]  talked down to no more being bullied no more ghee for hofstad i mean i mean what's not to like i know
[1:41:10.320 --> 1:41:16.240]  you're gonna miss us i know you want to ban our national flags but we're gonna wave you goodbye
[1:41:17.200 --> 1:41:24.960]  and we'll look forward in the future to working with you as sovereign well that's that's incredibly
[1:41:24.960 --> 1:41:30.960]  powerful you hear they cut his mic off the control freaks just cannot stand it you know they've tried
[1:41:30.960 --> 1:41:36.080]  to kill him six times i know the inside base policy but that um plane crashes you know the french
[1:41:36.080 --> 1:41:41.680]  police confirm they sabotage the brakes and the lug nuts on his car and when he when he said he was
[1:41:41.680 --> 1:41:48.880]  retiring that was to give the e you a chance to back down they didn't so that's that's george
[1:41:48.880 --> 1:41:56.400]  washington material right there that's the real deal ladies and gentlemen and uh they're trying to
[1:41:56.400 --> 1:42:02.000]  kill him over and over again so and i and i've i haven't reached that lofty status yet i mean they
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:08.640]  are so afraid of nizel feroz and he's so real let me tell you a little secret it's about you again
[1:42:09.360 --> 1:42:13.680]  he comes on this show i can twist his arm and get him on they attack him big time the national news
[1:42:13.680 --> 1:42:19.760]  over there when he does and he'll tell you half the support of uk going back 20 years ago he'd come
[1:42:19.760 --> 1:42:23.520]  on the show was from this show they didn't have any media over there but we had a huge
[1:42:23.520 --> 1:42:28.720]  listenership still do in england we were higher rated there on alexa than we are in the us and
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:34.560]  it was this audience you you you summon nizel feroz he'll he'll he'll tell you they wouldn't
[1:42:34.560 --> 1:42:40.480]  have gotten there without you america helped them have the revolution they helped us have ours
[1:42:40.480 --> 1:42:46.000]  it just history keeps repeating just like 1776 that wasn't a fight against the british it was a
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:52.080]  fight against the crown the tyranny of that time downwards the e u ha ha man this is powerful this
[1:42:52.080 --> 1:43:00.720]  is amazing we now know that more than 60 million people are on total lockdown in china and the
[1:43:00.720 --> 1:43:05.520]  food supplies and medical supplies are running out we know the virus has already spread to more than
[1:43:05.520 --> 1:43:11.680]  a dozen countries and many chinese who escaped wuhan are now confirmed to be arriving on the united
[1:43:11.680 --> 1:43:17.200]  states west coast we've now confirmed from major food suppliers across the united states that they've
[1:43:17.200 --> 1:43:22.080]  already run out of supplies affordable foods because of institutional and governmental buyers
[1:43:22.080 --> 1:43:26.960]  that's right the rich the powerful the elite big corporations are now buying up food stores at
[1:43:26.960 --> 1:43:32.320]  alarming rates info wars private labels from my patriot supply and ships right out of the very
[1:43:32.320 --> 1:43:37.520]  same factory they call and let us know that they have bought food forward but that's going to run out
[1:43:37.520 --> 1:43:42.240]  probably in a few weeks and that people need to order now they want to be able to get it within
[1:43:42.240 --> 1:43:48.320]  seven to ten days but if people wait it may end up being longer but if you get your order in now

[1:44:01.840 --> 1:44:07.120]  calling for global government as the answer and we've got massive huge censorship taking place
[1:44:07.120 --> 1:44:14.000]  it's coordinated by big tech and banks against people that promote america and guns and freedom
[1:44:14.000 --> 1:44:20.240]  and jesus and the family and the protection of the unborn wow yes now we know we're right the new
[1:44:20.240 --> 1:44:25.280]  world order is real satanism is real the pedophile a leader real but we're real as well and we love

[1:47:20.800 --> 1:47:24.000]  and then i do need to get into the trial the president and other breaking news but this
[1:47:24.000 --> 1:47:28.800]  this coronavirus is really just a watch and wait thing the response is over the top
[1:47:28.800 --> 1:47:32.000]  except by the united states
[1:47:36.080 --> 1:47:39.120]  so we'll try to figure it out with the callers with the listeners the toll free numbers eight
[1:47:39.120 --> 1:47:42.880]  seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine eight seven seven seven eight nine two five
[1:47:42.880 --> 1:47:47.120]  three nine we'd love to hear what you're seeing in your area we have a lot of folks that have
[1:47:47.760 --> 1:47:51.600]  called us or sent us emails from china saying they want to come on the show we're trying to
[1:47:51.600 --> 1:47:57.840]  line that up right now in the last day uh show look for that to be happening but you can just
[1:47:57.840 --> 1:48:05.360]  feel it you can see it it's the year 2020 it's going to be wild uh i'll say this it's a total
[1:48:05.360 --> 1:48:11.920]  win at every point of the compass we have the best horrible food for the price as i've said
[1:48:11.920 --> 1:48:16.400]  you can go out and find gourmet stuff that's five four or five times depending on it more
[1:48:16.400 --> 1:48:20.800]  expensive that tastes better like some of the stuff that's out there's like this some of the
[1:48:20.800 --> 1:48:24.640]  camping stuff like wow this is really delicious i go to a restaurant for this um
[1:48:24.640 --> 1:48:32.320]  um the the products from my patreon supply and their ready hour system is their entire line
[1:48:33.760 --> 1:48:38.880]  we've always private labeled it so i can get around the prices and go even lower but then
[1:48:38.880 --> 1:48:42.160]  that caused a big shakeup in the company and a bunch of stuff so we still call it
[1:48:42.160 --> 1:48:47.920]  in for select but it's it's all the same food it's it's it's ready hour okay um and
[1:48:47.920 --> 1:48:55.200]  then they are running out of the food they have about two weeks of confirmed in their warehouses
[1:48:55.200 --> 1:48:59.680]  in their three factories and it's 24 hours a day shipping out takes seven to ten days
[1:48:59.680 --> 1:49:05.680]  if you get your orders in now it's guaranteed seven to ten days they've got more 18 wheelers
[1:49:05.680 --> 1:49:08.400]  and they're flying all over the country and they're buying more food they got to check it
[1:49:08.400 --> 1:49:13.280]  and certify it and it's a big deal so their managers including the owner matt redhawk and
[1:49:13.280 --> 1:49:18.320]  the founder are criss-crossing up to three cities a day going in seeing it seeing the testing
[1:49:18.320 --> 1:49:23.920]  purchasing it that's how stuff works at that level you got to go put eyes on it so they may
[1:49:23.920 --> 1:49:31.120]  have more food in a couple weeks but at current sales rates they'll be sold out probably closer
[1:49:31.120 --> 1:49:34.560]  to a week and a half or so so i would get your orders in this is the place i get my storeable
[1:49:34.560 --> 1:49:40.160]  food nice big plastic you know tote hell i'll just walk over there and show you another of your calls
[1:49:40.160 --> 1:49:45.600]  but and then the the other big win is it funds the operation so this is insurance you can eat
[1:49:47.200 --> 1:49:50.640]  and they've got special diets they've got everything i mean that they've got
[1:49:50.640 --> 1:49:54.080]  hundreds of different packages but the big one people are getting is the three months
[1:49:54.720 --> 1:50:00.160]  and the four week and every family should have this i know my family has this i've got
[1:50:00.800 --> 1:50:04.560]  a three-year food supply like i said i've got months and months and months for everybody at my
[1:50:04.560 --> 1:50:10.640]  office here in case things get really serious because that's just something you do it's something
[1:50:10.640 --> 1:50:17.040]  that it's like brushing your teeth in the morning or drinking a cup of coffee it's a default and so
[1:50:17.040 --> 1:50:23.520]  it funds the info war it's insurance you can eat a 361 infowarstore.com and if you look at these
[1:50:23.520 --> 1:50:32.880]  babies i mean they are they are heavy heavy containers big old heavy containers and again
[1:50:32.880 --> 1:50:37.440]  at walmart or something a plastic container like this we were just getting it to hold things and
[1:50:37.440 --> 1:50:42.080]  it costs like five bucks or whatever and so again it's kind of hard to get these open at first
[1:50:44.160 --> 1:50:51.760]  but these are jam packed with high quality food maple grove oatmeal this is an oatmeal container
[1:50:52.560 --> 1:50:59.280]  and i just said to myself why in the hell am i ordering food for myself more food and then not
[1:50:59.280 --> 1:51:04.080]  plugging it and sure enough everybody was buying food oh i was kind of behind the curve on that
[1:51:04.960 --> 1:51:08.480]  because we're so ahead of the curve that it's just a default we're promoting high quality
[1:51:08.480 --> 1:51:13.600]  horrible food but i'll tell you what you really should do if you care about yourself and your
[1:51:13.600 --> 1:51:16.960]  children your family especially during the winter and when stuff like this is spreading around
[1:51:17.600 --> 1:51:23.440]  and it's the immune gargle with the patented nano silver at 15 parts per million beyond
[1:51:23.440 --> 1:51:27.520]  colloidal silver got the big bottles got the little bottles the medium sized bottles
[1:51:27.520 --> 1:51:30.480]  and the big bottles are all people are figuring out well that's a big bottle it's a better deal
[1:51:30.480 --> 1:51:35.280]  these are all selling out this will be sold out in probably a week or so the others maybe two weeks
[1:51:35.280 --> 1:51:39.840]  the current sales rates but i'm keeping it at 40 percent off because that's where it was
[1:51:40.960 --> 1:51:45.920]  you're going to get a better deal on high quality nano silver than this that's the same nano silver
[1:51:45.920 --> 1:51:51.360]  just at higher parts per million in the wound gel all available at infowars.com and look it's
[1:51:51.360 --> 1:51:55.200]  important to have your vitamin d3 it's really important to have your fish oil that has that and
[1:51:55.200 --> 1:52:00.560]  it's very bioavailable but the first line of defense is the mouth and that's where this stuff
[1:52:00.560 --> 1:52:05.600]  gets and grows and starts replicating first as you know well you hit yourself with this twice
[1:52:05.600 --> 1:52:10.320]  today and look i personally think i got another bit absorbed through the lips and through the gums
[1:52:10.320 --> 1:52:17.920]  and through the you know mouth so i don't swallow it but you can swallow this is 15 parts per million
[1:52:17.920 --> 1:52:22.560]  if you want that added level that's why it's called immune gargle infowars.com okay i'm done
[1:52:22.560 --> 1:52:28.880]  plugging but people are getting prepared that's smart that's a default so that's why we were ahead
[1:52:28.880 --> 1:52:32.480]  of the curve because that's what we're promoting that's what we're doing i like to be healthy i like
[1:52:32.480 --> 1:52:37.360]  to live i like my children to be healthy i like them living uh and so i'm already taken the x2
[1:52:37.360 --> 1:52:41.520]  i'm already taken the winter sun i already got the swirable food i got the guns i know how to use
[1:52:41.520 --> 1:52:47.280]  them i know you do as well we're the folks that are just old-fashioned which is not old-fashioned
[1:52:47.280 --> 1:52:52.320]  it's what humans are supposed to be not completely domesticated idiots living hand to mouth and i
[1:52:52.320 --> 1:52:57.840]  know a lot of folks can't have a bunch of horrible food but anybody can afford the four-week food
[1:52:57.840 --> 1:53:01.760]  supply because this is cheaper you're gonna get in any grocery store or any other storeable food
[1:53:01.760 --> 1:53:06.800]  company that's that's that's that's that's decent quality infowars.com i'm done plugging but the
[1:53:06.800 --> 1:53:11.440]  window is closing we hope you don't ever need this but you can go camping with it or give it away
[1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:15.600]  but it's good to have it's essential to have and it's great to get it infowars.com because you
[1:53:15.600 --> 1:53:18.480]  know it's high quality you know you're gonna get it and you know it funds the info war that's why
[1:53:18.480 --> 1:53:24.880]  i say it covers every point of the compass with the total 360 win okay let's go ahead now and take
[1:53:24.880 --> 1:53:34.400]  a call let's go ahead and talk to sam in los vegas and then pastor sam and i'll and i'm going to
[1:53:34.400 --> 1:53:40.560]  get to everybody but uh sam in los vegas go ahead it's an honor sir i've listened to you for a long
[1:53:40.560 --> 1:53:51.280]  time uh am 6 70 in los vegas uh announced about prox billion an hour ago that one of our hospitals
[1:53:51.280 --> 1:54:01.040]  here has a suspected case of the coronavirus that the guy that's in the hospital is under quarantine
[1:54:01.040 --> 1:54:14.400]  and he has been here in vegas about 10 days really yes they announced it just very nonchalant
[1:54:14.400 --> 1:54:21.040]  and none of the local talk media nobody's covering they they made one announcement and that was it
[1:54:21.040 --> 1:54:27.040]  well i don't want to scare people but paul watson's got the big article up on infowars.com where they've
[1:54:27.040 --> 1:54:33.280]  got this big medical science computer crunching company that's respected and they said 183 million
[1:54:33.280 --> 1:54:41.120]  people infected by the end of february and i was looking i said that's the 29th of february that
[1:54:41.120 --> 1:54:45.600]  february it's 28 days but this is leap year so i was looking at it and and and if you believe the
[1:54:45.600 --> 1:54:50.320]  land's a study that's 15 death rate i was saying 18 excuse me i mean that's anywhere near true this
[1:54:50.320 --> 1:54:55.040]  this would be just super devastating just from the fear factor in the economy and obviously
[1:54:55.040 --> 1:55:01.600]  all those uh sad deaths so what do you think's going on well everybody knows it's a bio wet
[1:55:04.480 --> 1:55:08.800]  is that what everybody's saying all right everybody that i've spoken with they all know it
[1:55:14.880 --> 1:55:19.600]  all right so go ahead yeah that's that's all i had i just wanted to put that out there you
[1:55:19.600 --> 1:55:26.240]  may want to check with the clark county uh health department and see if they've released
[1:55:26.240 --> 1:55:32.320]  statements but uh i'm sure your team will be all over it thank you alex for everything you do thank
[1:55:32.320 --> 1:55:37.200]  you god bless you man i just hope this isn't really super deadly i'm hoping that nobody does
[1:55:37.200 --> 1:55:42.000]  it's just like really and then why is it trump stopping the flights from china because that's
[1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:45.600]  going to be the vector to bring it all in i'm just gonna keep asking that question because russians
[1:55:45.600 --> 1:55:50.320]  close their borders with china they banned the flights yesterday uh now this is just ongoing
[1:55:50.320 --> 1:55:57.440]  so i'm just asking the question uh let's go ahead and talk to pastor sam who actually helped elin
[1:55:57.440 --> 1:56:04.000]  out when he was out on the road in iowa pastor sam what do you think's going on you suggested it alex
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:10.640]  that china had declared war on the united states and that trump perhaps ordered a biological attack
[1:56:10.640 --> 1:56:16.480]  as a counter strike i've looked into that and thought about it some more and i've become i think
[1:56:16.480 --> 1:56:22.000]  that this is really viable you know it's china that was pushing us to go in and destroy iran
[1:56:22.720 --> 1:56:28.000]  which is the last country in the way of their belt and road initiative if you look at the map
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:32.240]  with the other side of the world you know it's easy for america to forget about but up against
[1:56:32.240 --> 1:56:36.800]  russia you got the casting sea and the arrow sea and the only thing in the way of them bulldozing
[1:56:36.800 --> 1:56:43.280]  all the way to the Mediterranean is iran and even if they had a revolution and the uh you know the
[1:56:43.280 --> 1:56:48.800]  persian people took power there'll be a sovereign nation with a strong military that china couldn't
[1:56:48.800 --> 1:56:55.840]  totally push around so they needed to be a failed state and i just see that global war has already
[1:56:55.840 --> 1:57:02.160]  begun all the news that has not been reported the nuclear detonation in the south china sea which to
[1:57:02.160 --> 1:57:07.840]  me look like a nuclear depth charge everybody forgot about that other attacks the decapitation
[1:57:07.840 --> 1:57:16.160]  strike of the taiwanese uh generals or maybe that was just a one in ten gazillion accident no i think
[1:57:16.160 --> 1:57:21.120]  it was a decapitation strike just cut the head off of the taiwanese military a nation of work
[1:57:21.120 --> 1:57:26.000]  treaty bound to defend so i think this is very specific and that's the question that i have not
[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:31.440]  been able to find an answer to and we're hold on let's come back and talk about that the only
[1:57:31.440 --> 1:57:37.760]  reason that could be true is it's tit for tat in war china's hit nush with fentanyl and it's killed
[1:57:37.760 --> 1:57:44.160]  millions and so yeah um the chinese genome is so similar you could have a race specific just for them
[1:57:45.920 --> 1:57:54.400]  this time of year i'm always promoting winter sun our high quality organic vitamin d3 vitamin k
[1:57:54.400 --> 1:58:00.480]  combo because it's in the fall it's in the winter it's in the spring that people aren't getting
[1:58:00.480 --> 1:58:06.640]  sunlight so your body can't produce the vitamin d it needs and then that's the main reason people
[1:58:06.640 --> 1:58:12.560]  succumb to things like influenza and other deadly viruses that are wreaking havoc out there it's on
[1:58:12.560 --> 1:58:18.400]  record that you've got to have this to live not just to defend against these viruses so right now
[1:58:18.400 --> 1:58:23.680]  we have winter sun still available even though we always order only so much for sale during the fall
[1:58:23.680 --> 1:58:31.600]  winter and spring i'm going to let it sell out at the sales price of 40 off 23 dollars despite the
[1:58:31.600 --> 1:58:36.640]  fact that i could sell it at full price because i want you to get it and i want to incentivize you
[1:58:36.640 --> 1:58:42.240]  protecting yourself and your family so winter sun taken under the tongue super high quality 40
[1:58:42.240 --> 1:58:49.520]  percent off available now at info war store dot com if you understand why the globalist why the
[1:58:49.520 --> 1:58:57.280]  servants of satan hate info wars it's because we're awake we're alive we're passionate and we're not
[1:58:57.280 --> 1:59:03.200]  giving up that's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the new world order's plans
[1:59:03.760 --> 1:59:08.960]  to not get down when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us that's what
[1:59:08.960 --> 1:59:14.800]  we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags the globalists have literally sold their
[1:59:14.800 --> 1:59:20.320]  souls to the dark side and they do what they do because they're slaves because they are eternally
[1:59:20.320 --> 1:59:26.880]  driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent it is up to us who are awake not the
[1:59:26.880 --> 1:59:35.040]  sheep and not the wolves but the sheep dogs to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants they fear
[1:59:35.040 --> 1:59:42.800]  the fact that we are awake they fear the fact that we are alive they fear the fact that we love god
[1:59:42.800 --> 1:59:46.320]  and that's all we ever have to know is that god is in charge
[1:59:46.320 --> 2:00:13.600]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:00:13.600 --> 2:00:25.040]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones well something's going on i don't think
[2:00:25.040 --> 2:00:30.880]  anybody doubts that at this point and yeah things are not going as uh they normally would with this
[2:00:30.880 --> 2:00:34.800]  with this virus and the numbers they say have been infected the numbers that are dead the response
[2:00:34.800 --> 2:00:41.040]  is way bigger than that and confirmed infected coronavirus carriers now shedding virus without
[2:00:41.040 --> 2:00:45.200]  symptoms that's a new lands at study new mike adams natural news dot com article it's up on
[2:00:45.200 --> 2:00:50.320]  info wars dot com coronavirus spreads for first time in us cdc says senator calls for immediate
[2:00:50.320 --> 2:00:58.320]  shutdown of all flights from china senator cotton uh and pastor sam says is this part of a war with
[2:00:58.320 --> 2:01:04.320]  china because china has been in a covert war with the united states targeting our civilians with
[2:01:04.320 --> 2:01:11.440]  fentanyl i remember a caller saying i bet trump hits him with a bio weapon like six months ago
[2:01:12.240 --> 2:01:18.320]  we had a caller say i bet trump hits the chinese with a bio weapon for this i remember that call
[2:01:19.360 --> 2:01:24.560]  and i'm not saying that's what this is the caller brought it up but it is intriguing and
[2:01:27.760 --> 2:01:32.240]  who knows good morning there was a 28 increase in coronavirus cases overnight in china
[2:01:32.240 --> 2:01:37.440]  make no mistake though they aren't new cases just what china is willing to admit it's much worse
[2:01:38.160 --> 2:01:45.680]  as senator cotton styled in uh what do you think pastor sam we're 96 hours now into the 82nd
[2:01:45.680 --> 2:01:52.000]  airborne being officially in columbia training with columbian paratroopers for airfield seizure
[2:01:52.000 --> 2:01:58.320]  thun reuters now i had broadcast already that the whole reason that the 82nd deployed to the
[2:01:58.320 --> 2:02:05.360]  middle east was so that they could deploy secretly and come unannounced when we come into venezuela
[2:02:05.360 --> 2:02:10.320]  which the president has promised to do elliott abrams has promised to do the signs are there
[2:02:10.320 --> 2:02:15.760]  the all the world leaders have begged for us to come in and help this nation and to clean out the
[2:02:15.760 --> 2:02:22.240]  rat's nest that is the source of the migrant invasion the corrupt government the overthrows
[2:02:22.240 --> 2:02:27.520]  the massive destructive riots and everything else that's wrong with the america that's coming
[2:02:27.520 --> 2:02:32.800]  out of those dictatorships which have made that bed in venezuela so that's where the president's
[2:02:32.800 --> 2:02:36.880]  going to fight he's going to free the hemisphere that's why we're pulling back from these other
[2:02:36.880 --> 2:02:42.480]  fronts but china china china this is why the other nations couldn't do it peru can't go in
[2:02:42.480 --> 2:02:48.960]  and and liberate venezuela china will stomp their guts out so they need their big brother to come in
[2:02:48.960 --> 2:02:54.240]  with the big stick and we've still got it and trump knows how to walk softly and carry a big
[2:02:54.240 --> 2:02:58.480]  stick and let me tell you even if he won't pull the trigger on the really really horrific things
[2:02:58.480 --> 2:03:04.800]  the prophets will we will prophesy destruction and let's just say there's some word set over the
[2:03:04.800 --> 2:03:10.160]  swamp after owen and i both got arrested in washington area for going in there just to
[2:03:10.160 --> 2:03:15.120]  observe and report but no that can't be allowed a man with a microphone that's uncontrolled they
[2:03:15.120 --> 2:03:18.960]  got to stand up against that well they're gonna have to deal with god and any swamp creatures
[2:03:18.960 --> 2:03:25.920]  that are hiding behind big blocks of marble might just get cleaned out by the hand of god we'll see
[2:03:25.920 --> 2:03:32.400]  what happens but yeah i mean god could have launched the bio weapon i mean i i just i think
[2:03:32.400 --> 2:03:37.840]  it's quite a it it it clearly has been souped up if it's as deadly as they even think halfway is bad
[2:03:38.720 --> 2:03:46.640]  and and then you got bill gates involved stirring around i don't know i i just i just hope and pray
[2:03:46.640 --> 2:03:54.800]  that well why the only reason trump wouldn't block it coming to the us is if it was race specific
[2:03:55.840 --> 2:04:00.640]  and we're gonna find out on that really really quickly um and of course they have race specific
[2:04:00.640 --> 2:04:07.200]  weapons so but i mean would trumps that they're and kill chinese americans no i know they're
[2:04:07.200 --> 2:04:10.400]  hitting us with fentanyl and that's so it's like oh you're gonna target civilian populations that's
[2:04:10.400 --> 2:04:13.360]  what you do in the military if somebody targets your civilians you target theirs i mean that's
[2:04:13.360 --> 2:04:19.360]  how the threat continuum works that's what that's military doctrine um that that's on the table and
[2:04:19.360 --> 2:04:23.600]  that's what you do tit for tat so they've been hitting us with the chemical weapons so trump
[2:04:23.600 --> 2:04:29.360]  hits them with a bio weapon i know trump is neurotic about hating drugs but what he's also a
[2:04:29.360 --> 2:04:35.120]  germaphobe i don't know that's pretty bold i don't know i think trump would do something like that
[2:04:35.120 --> 2:04:39.760]  and think that i have the leaks i just don't think he'd do that i don't i don't i'm not saying you're
[2:04:39.760 --> 2:04:44.240]  wrong pastor sam it's just it's it's it's quite a thought and that's why we're taking calls wow
[2:04:44.240 --> 2:04:49.520]  that was amazing all right more calls straight ahead on the other side but first why are they so
[2:04:49.520 --> 2:04:58.960]  scared of the film in game we'll be right back it is i the leader of cobra here for a message to
[2:04:58.960 --> 2:05:06.960]  president trump the american people and alex jones of info wars our operation for our partners the
[2:05:06.960 --> 2:05:15.360]  communist chinese have bought control of your media but it's true your people are beginning to awaken
[2:05:16.000 --> 2:05:23.120]  that's why cobra is launching operations to trigger race war mass shootings and bombings
[2:05:23.120 --> 2:05:30.640]  which will be blamed on those loyal to america anyone once we stage these attacks that does not
[2:05:30.640 --> 2:05:40.240]  blame it on trump will also be targeted by cobra in the future you see when you expose our false
[2:05:40.240 --> 2:05:48.640]  flags and fake media i will carry out attacks and then blame you like we've done with alex jones
[2:05:48.640 --> 2:06:02.240]  blaming him for mass shootings we committed
[2:06:02.240 --> 2:06:11.840]  so
[2:06:11.840 --> 2:06:19.440]  well they're driving around in china with giant fumigators pumping out chemicals hoping to kill
[2:06:19.440 --> 2:06:26.960]  the virus and the government is using it for a police state authoritarian enforcement drill
[2:06:26.960 --> 2:06:32.480]  governments need to be willing to do things that are out of their historical perspective
[2:06:34.240 --> 2:06:39.200]  for the most part it's it's really a war footing that we need to be on you know really the big
[2:06:39.200 --> 2:06:49.120]  takeaway from this is info wars analyzing the globalist program has absolutely with films and
[2:06:49.120 --> 2:06:56.640]  articles and guests and powerpoint presentations thousands of times detailed exactly what you see
[2:06:56.640 --> 2:07:05.520]  beginning to unfold in china with the coronavirus and the fact that billa melinda gates a few months
[2:07:05.520 --> 2:07:10.880]  ago had a big drill for something similar to this that would kill 65 million people starting in china
[2:07:12.400 --> 2:07:18.080]  how much control of information should there be and by whom and how can false information be
[2:07:18.080 --> 2:07:23.920]  effectively challenged and what if that false information is coming from companies or from
[2:07:23.920 --> 2:07:31.040]  governments we're at a moment where the social media platforms have to step forward and recognize
[2:07:31.040 --> 2:07:37.440]  the moment to assert that there are technology platform and not a broadcaster is is over they
[2:07:37.440 --> 2:07:42.960]  in fact have to be a participant in broadcasting accurate information and partnering with the
[2:07:42.960 --> 2:07:50.000]  scientific and health communities to counterweight if not flood the zone of accurate information
[2:07:50.000 --> 2:07:54.960]  because to try to put the genie back in the bottle of the misinformation and disinformation is not
[2:07:54.960 --> 2:08:00.240]  impossible one thing we haven't spoken about and i'm wondering whether it's time to talk about this
[2:08:00.240 --> 2:08:06.560]  is a step up from the part of the government's on enforcement actions against fake news and you
[2:08:06.560 --> 2:08:17.680]  know i made a film i guess 13 years ago called in game blueprint for global enslavement communist
[2:08:17.680 --> 2:08:25.280]  china is the model planned society for the new world order china has received more united nations
[2:08:25.280 --> 2:08:32.640]  awards for its policies and form of governance than any other nation and what's it's on the back
[2:08:32.640 --> 2:08:37.520]  they want you dead and i explain everything in the film and it's a three-hour film
[2:08:38.080 --> 2:08:44.240]  predatory elites have always rationalized their oppression by claiming that they are superior
[2:08:44.240 --> 2:08:50.560]  and have the divine right to rule when all they really are is a gaggle of ruthless psychopaths
[2:08:50.560 --> 2:08:56.480]  parasitically feeding on the host population until their cancerous movement causes the collapse of
[2:08:56.480 --> 2:09:06.960]  the host and we sold a couple hundred thousand copies of it and i put it out for free on google
[2:09:06.960 --> 2:09:14.480]  video and it got over 50 million views on there before google got rid of google video and it's
[2:09:14.480 --> 2:09:19.600]  got about 10 million views on different platforms on youtube but the point is is that if you watch
[2:09:19.600 --> 2:09:29.280]  this 13 year old film it lays out how they would use contrived bio crises epidemics to bring in
[2:09:29.280 --> 2:09:38.960]  world government they are promising to deliver an invincible tyranny that will dwarf their past exploits
[2:09:38.960 --> 2:09:44.880]  in the days of world war two there were sovereign nations and armies to stand against hitler's
[2:09:44.880 --> 2:09:54.320]  final solution once world government is in place no one will be able to stop the new world
[2:09:54.320 --> 2:10:00.560]  waters plans for global population reduction for those immune to psychological program
[2:10:01.120 --> 2:10:04.640]  hundreds of fema camps have already been built throughout the united states
[2:10:05.280 --> 2:10:11.440]  in their quest for population reduction no method is off the table these dark builders
[2:10:11.440 --> 2:10:17.200]  intend to release a string of man-made bio weapons plagues each one worse than the last
[2:10:17.200 --> 2:10:27.680]  last amazon prime a video gives amateur how-to conspiracy theories a stage
[2:10:28.720 --> 2:10:35.040]  then it goes on to say oh questionable films you can't have a book or a film that's questionable
[2:10:35.040 --> 2:10:41.520]  in the marketplace just not allowed somebody up there says no so it says amazon took down
[2:10:41.520 --> 2:10:48.800]  the alex jones film in game for violating community standards now when you watch in game
[2:10:48.800 --> 2:10:56.800]  it's all their words their plan their smart cities their control grids and then the bio crises
[2:10:56.800 --> 2:11:03.360]  they'll trigger each one bigger than the last as the news titans are on your throat for world
[2:11:03.360 --> 2:11:10.400]  government and how they say they'll use it for world government pretty important information
[2:11:10.400 --> 2:11:17.840]  and the film starts out exposing hitler and eugenics and those organizations sterilizing
[2:11:17.840 --> 2:11:24.880]  poor white people in blacks in america that's a ski experiment and so that's what violates
[2:11:24.880 --> 2:11:33.040]  community standards now you see because the film's too powerful by the way the film has
[2:11:33.040 --> 2:11:38.240]  been reposted to band on video and i think i'm gonna also do an updated version just where we
[2:11:38.240 --> 2:11:42.800]  stop and start and do updates on how it all came true because it was already being done
[2:11:43.760 --> 2:11:48.560]  so it didn't come true it just rolled out it's like when mcdonald's first came out in the 50s
[2:11:48.560 --> 2:11:52.800]  it was one of them and so i was like i was in a place it was called mcdonald's i ate there
[2:11:53.680 --> 2:12:01.040]  the food was really fast and then mcdonald's fears later came to your town well that's what
[2:12:01.040 --> 2:12:05.120]  the globalist system is they beta test that they have it and then it's not a mcdonald's it's a new
[2:12:05.120 --> 2:12:11.360]  world order it then comes to you comes to your doorstep that's why you can't go out i mean nobody
[2:12:11.360 --> 2:12:19.360]  wants to run to idaho or utah or you know some place in the rocky is more than me nobody won't
[2:12:19.360 --> 2:12:23.680]  nobody wants solitude and to be around nobody with my family i mean i like people but i like
[2:12:23.680 --> 2:12:27.600]  solitude even more let's just say there's choosing when i want to be around people
[2:12:27.600 --> 2:12:35.440]  i'm actually introverted but to be left alone i must be extroverted you understand
[2:12:35.440 --> 2:12:40.640]  so everybody's always balanced imagine how extroverted i am i'm super introverted but
[2:12:41.840 --> 2:12:48.080]  we can't run folks we can't just hand everything over and then just wait 10 20 years i'm not doing it
[2:12:49.360 --> 2:12:51.120]  so it's not that i'm going down with the ship
[2:12:51.120 --> 2:12:59.440]  this is the only ship we've got this whole planet there there's there's nowhere to run
[2:13:01.520 --> 2:13:07.680]  this is it there's not a life raft there's nothing this is it right here our children
[2:13:07.680 --> 2:13:14.000]  their future but also everybody that fought like hell before us to build this planet tough people
[2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:18.240]  hard work and people serious people focus folks they believed in their children they believed in
[2:13:18.240 --> 2:13:23.760]  themself they believed in god we can't let them down you understand we are those people i'm not
[2:13:23.760 --> 2:13:31.120]  letting them down and it is it's it's beyond magic magic was just things people knew but they
[2:13:31.120 --> 2:13:36.000]  didn't understand technology is indistinguishable from what would be called magic obviously clark
[2:13:36.000 --> 2:13:42.000]  said that 70 years ago and it's even more true today and the future's here it's just not evenly
[2:13:42.000 --> 2:13:48.480]  distributed forget who said that but it's even more true a lot of folks have said that they came
[2:13:48.480 --> 2:13:56.480]  and figured out who said it first but this is the animating contest of liberty and you could feel
[2:13:56.480 --> 2:14:00.800]  the big challenge you can feel that's why everybody's buying up all the storable food that's why the
[2:14:00.800 --> 2:14:04.960]  store shelves are going to be it's why the pentagon's doing all the stuff because beyond all the things
[2:14:04.960 --> 2:14:13.280]  we see you can really feel maybe maybe it's not this virus but subconsciously spiritually everyone
[2:14:13.280 --> 2:14:18.640]  feels a big threat and so then you see a virus everybody over panics because you know
[2:14:20.880 --> 2:14:24.720]  it'd be like if you knew the mafia was sending hit men to your house you knew they were coming
[2:14:24.720 --> 2:14:29.680]  in about an hour well you're getting out of your house 30 minutes later and you see an SUV drive by
[2:14:29.680 --> 2:14:35.440]  you know you think oh god that's them even though that's not them you jump because but see that's not
[2:14:35.440 --> 2:14:43.040]  the hit man so we know the hit man's coming but are we jumping at shadows before it gets
[2:14:43.040 --> 2:14:48.160]  here is it what else is it while we're watching this while we're over here looking at this what
[2:14:48.160 --> 2:14:53.280]  else is going on over here that's what we've got to be asking ourselves what's going on down here
[2:14:53.280 --> 2:15:00.640]  and over there and around that way that's what we've got to start thinking about so the news is so
[2:15:00.640 --> 2:15:07.440]  intense and so over the top i'm just obsessing over the virus because it's it's key we all know that
[2:15:07.440 --> 2:15:13.120]  but the meltdown in the senate and then calling for rand paul to be arrested and and just i mean
[2:15:13.840 --> 2:15:17.120]  these people are out of control and they're desperate they're hitting the panic button
[2:15:17.120 --> 2:15:22.560]  and so we look at that and go these people are out of control yeah because a drowning rat
[2:15:24.320 --> 2:15:29.200]  looks pretty powerful when it's down in a bucket squeaking and swapping and flapping its arms around
[2:15:31.440 --> 2:15:35.680]  and you know i just can't wait for people like senator blumenthal to burn in hell
[2:15:36.800 --> 2:15:41.440]  for all the crimes he's committed against this country i want a shack of devilish filth he is
[2:15:41.440 --> 2:15:52.240]  for the right back stay with us

[2:18:17.440 --> 2:18:23.040]  experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began studying this effect in
[2:18:23.040 --> 2:18:28.880]  published trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research a fast-acting chewable

[2:18:34.880 --> 2:18:39.760]  it is not an antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually acts by

[2:20:16.880 --> 2:20:20.640]  hour in the mat bracket next over but i've got to take at least four calls during this time in
[2:20:20.640 --> 2:20:27.200]  this segment so let's go to doug in canada kit neighbors from asia go ahead doug thank you
[2:20:27.760 --> 2:20:32.560]  and one reason i called is that i think it was like the day after this broke out you had mike
[2:20:32.560 --> 2:20:39.120]  adams on he had a family member talked to people in china and uh my neighbor's wife is philippine
[2:20:39.120 --> 2:20:45.600]  and filipino and has friends family in china and uh she concurred on everything mike said but it was
[2:20:45.600 --> 2:20:52.560]  worse uh she was told that they basically locked down the entire wuhan place and whatever supplies
[2:20:52.560 --> 2:20:58.240]  and people they had in there were left nothing in nothing out so that's the news i got i just
[2:20:58.240 --> 2:21:02.240]  wanted to share it whether it's good bad or indifferent you know that's confirmed too and
[2:21:02.240 --> 2:21:08.480]  they've got robots that are have people quarantine and the robots deliver them their food i mean
[2:21:08.480 --> 2:21:14.960]  this is just crazy talk about science fiction yeah this is bad man um you know i was just
[2:21:14.960 --> 2:21:19.200]  listening to Nigel Farage before talking about globalism and populism it's even bigger than
[2:21:19.200 --> 2:21:24.800]  that this is good and good versus evil right here and this isn't say a big plague that wipes a ton
[2:21:24.800 --> 2:21:29.120]  of people out sooner or later there's going to be something there's going to be something so whoever's
[2:21:29.120 --> 2:21:35.440]  not prepared by now you better get that way and and something you said a long time ago and i knew
[2:21:35.440 --> 2:21:40.320]  it was simple but it was effective what he said you better choose what side you're on and you better
[2:21:40.320 --> 2:21:45.280]  have a relationship with god because we may be defenseless against something like this if it hits
[2:21:45.280 --> 2:21:51.040]  you know what i mean no you're right and they just showed me footage from wuhan talk about sensational
[2:21:52.240 --> 2:21:57.440]  we know that they have these container buildings they're bringing in on 18 wheelers that are little
[2:21:57.440 --> 2:22:03.120]  tiny cells with bars and windows now it's official they are welding the door shut on the apartment
[2:22:03.120 --> 2:22:08.400]  buildings and then hammering wood around the seals and then basically condemning the buildings to
[2:22:08.400 --> 2:22:15.120]  death they're sealing them in into death tubes i mean you can't make this up and and so whatever
[2:22:15.120 --> 2:22:20.880]  the hell is going on this is a big wake-up call of how we are hand to mouth paycheck to paycheck
[2:22:21.680 --> 2:22:25.920]  i i mean again i know how to skin a buck run a trot line and i've got some horrible foods and
[2:22:25.920 --> 2:22:32.560]  weapons still 90 of the public's not self-sufficient or more that's beat that's like a if people think
[2:22:32.560 --> 2:22:39.280]  army ants will go through the jungle and just clear out acres a day with not one leaf left humans are
[2:22:39.280 --> 2:22:47.360]  like giant bipedal piranhas and again they've got pentagon and other studies within 10 days
[2:22:47.360 --> 2:22:52.960]  almost everyone becomes totally psychotic criminal within 15 days uh cannibals in a breakdown of
[2:22:52.960 --> 2:23:00.000]  civilization with without food and water uh at the levels needed and now again a lot of 10 percent
[2:23:00.000 --> 2:23:04.080]  or so depend on the study they kill themselves people either kill themselves or they become demonic
[2:23:04.080 --> 2:23:10.320]  piranhas and so can you imagine what will happen we should be having that discussion if this kind
[2:23:10.320 --> 2:23:14.640]  of stuff happens here because the Chinese say what you want about them they got high IQs and
[2:23:14.640 --> 2:23:18.800]  you know they're very diverse group when it comes to some people are super you know outgoing but
[2:23:18.800 --> 2:23:24.560]  you know the stereotype is true very very uh introspective uh you know not extroverted
[2:23:24.560 --> 2:23:29.280]  so imagine how they're going to be behaving imagine what spoiled rotten and i'm not putting
[2:23:29.280 --> 2:23:33.280]  america down but come on let's be honest on average imagine how spoiled rotten americans
[2:23:33.280 --> 2:23:38.960]  are going to behave if this starts happening here you try to lock anybody up in an apartment
[2:23:38.960 --> 2:23:42.880]  building here with well that it's shut you're going to get your head torn off i mean people will go
[2:23:42.880 --> 2:23:49.760]  crazy uh i know i would uh so what do you think yeah that's bar barric that's medieval bar barric
[2:23:49.760 --> 2:23:53.200]  what they're doing over there they don't have any respect for life neither did a globalist
[2:23:53.200 --> 2:23:57.680]  that we're dealing with and by the way we're showing footage of them grabbing women off the
[2:23:57.680 --> 2:24:03.360]  street and they're fighting back in china so you talk about police state man it is melting down fast
[2:24:03.920 --> 2:24:07.600]  why i was i was in korea for a year and i could speak from that that
[2:24:08.320 --> 2:24:14.080]  asian countries are far more disciplined and harder core in a sense than we are so you know what
[2:24:15.280 --> 2:24:19.760]  if it comes here i can't say that we didn't deserve something to get rid of the week
[2:24:19.760 --> 2:24:24.320]  and i i've had a relationship with god my whole life i'm one year older than you we got the same
[2:24:24.320 --> 2:24:31.440]  amount of kids i've already had discussion i did not hang up on you uh you there you're saying
[2:24:31.440 --> 2:24:36.640]  something good when you called it sorry i guess your phone cut um the footage coming in is like
[2:24:36.640 --> 2:24:41.520]  beyond a world war z if you're a radio listener you're lucky you're not seeing this i mean this is
[2:24:41.520 --> 2:24:48.480]  insane i'm starting to see i i decided to come in here today and play that tucker carlson clip
[2:24:48.480 --> 2:24:58.080]  up front and say everything's okay hopefully and whatever this is people are just dropping like
[2:24:58.080 --> 2:25:02.240]  this is not regular pneumonia folks whatever this is mutating into is not good
[2:25:09.440 --> 2:25:15.360]  this looks fake though right here the other footage you can tell you just know when you look
[2:25:15.360 --> 2:25:20.400]  at something like plastic fruit you know it's fake this that's real footage obviously the other stuff
[2:25:20.400 --> 2:25:26.320]  is real and some of the people on the ground it's real but this next footage is fake i mean if i was
[2:25:26.320 --> 2:25:31.520]  a betting man i mean everybody knows what's fake and what's real why the hell would that that
[2:25:32.800 --> 2:25:37.920]  looks fake to me the way her arms are laid out the way he is just like i said to those kids
[2:25:37.920 --> 2:25:41.360]  being nerve gassed was fake turned out the kids were alive later and said they were paid to do it
[2:25:41.360 --> 2:25:47.600]  by the u by the u n and the white helmets i mean you could tell it was fake you know it's like
[2:25:47.600 --> 2:25:51.760]  you're the kids want to like opens his eyes stops then keeps going to the kid i mean you know it's
[2:25:51.760 --> 2:25:57.200]  fake go back to that it's not as fake as the chemical attack that was a hundred percent like
[2:25:57.200 --> 2:26:06.160]  bad acting but this just first look my subconscious my spirit goes fake like why would two of them
[2:26:06.160 --> 2:26:11.600]  be laying down beside each other like that too that what the hell is going on here
[2:26:14.560 --> 2:26:15.680]  unless it's 5g
[2:26:18.160 --> 2:26:22.560]  like where's my articles i know greg rees is doing one on that i have one wuhan was the province

[2:35:29.200 --> 2:35:33.360]  two feet off and you know that's the thing about luke skywalker and the death star don't think about
[2:35:33.360 --> 2:35:37.200]  it just do it turn off the targeting computer because your brain's a bigger targeting computer
[2:35:37.200 --> 2:35:42.000]  than that targeting computer and you've all got that too i'm not telling you these stories to go
[2:35:42.000 --> 2:35:48.800]  oh alex you're superman i'm not i'm just like you and everything this system does is to suppress
[2:35:48.800 --> 2:35:54.000]  the fact that we do have the living god in us we're jacked in and have god's discernment but
[2:35:54.000 --> 2:35:59.920]  can we handle it and it's like the garth brook song some of god's greatest gifts are unanswered
[2:35:59.920 --> 2:36:07.520]  prayers it's totally true and this is the time to pray because something begs the foot
[2:36:08.960 --> 2:36:13.120]  we knew 2020 was going to be crazy and you're just going to see it's like seals being opened
[2:36:13.760 --> 2:36:19.360]  it's just boom boom boom boom boom it's going to be incredible and it's going to be bad but
[2:36:19.360 --> 2:36:25.280]  it's also going to be good and in the process of world government only lasting an hour
[2:36:25.280 --> 2:36:33.200]  and then it falls but you're going to see it and and the moment it's built it starts collapsing
[2:36:34.080 --> 2:36:39.120]  so let the little roosters sit up there and crow how powerful they are and how great they are
[2:36:39.120 --> 2:36:43.840]  they're cut off from god and we shouldn't even be happy about that it's sad that hillary clinton
[2:36:43.840 --> 2:36:49.520]  is such a demon possessed creature it's sad that blooming ball is it is a husk of a man he's a he's
[2:36:49.520 --> 2:36:55.200]  a he's a demon he did not even a human in there don't sit there and look at them and like a look
[2:36:55.200 --> 2:37:03.840]  at that scum and feel good that's a human we lost look at those eyes look at tim cook
[2:37:05.200 --> 2:37:11.440]  that's not a person you know plastic fruit when you see it that's not human right there
[2:37:11.440 --> 2:37:17.760]  there that's a psychotic
[2:37:23.600 --> 2:37:27.920]  that's an avatar that guy's like a driverless car folks
[2:37:29.200 --> 2:37:37.360]  well there's somebody driving gonna eat them and thank god we're not with the devil that's just
[2:37:37.360 --> 2:37:45.520]  every moment i'm just thank you god because i've experienced and i've seen the emptiness of the
[2:37:45.520 --> 2:37:51.920]  satanist and i just cannot believe that they have no idea the power of god but then you when
[2:37:51.920 --> 2:37:56.720]  you jack into that power you're just like you're not in the power to be more because you are now
[2:37:56.720 --> 2:38:02.960]  in the power you're just like oh power it's all there completeness absolute beauty everything
[2:38:02.960 --> 2:38:08.080]  you're like what the hell did you why are they not with this because they don't know
[2:38:08.080 --> 2:38:15.440]  ladies and gentlemen i have felt the satanic energy i have had it come through me and god
[2:38:15.440 --> 2:38:21.200]  did that as a test when i was young so that i could measure it and and know it and also see
[2:38:21.200 --> 2:38:25.840]  that it's failed in week so that later when i really experienced god's real power i would know the
[2:38:25.840 --> 2:38:38.000]  difference it's not even comparable mindless will to power and rage to hurt people that's all it is
[2:38:38.000 --> 2:38:43.600]  the only power satan can give you is to tear innocence apart that's all there is is just a rage
[2:38:43.600 --> 2:38:52.240]  against god's grace you think that's power that's not power that's weakness i'm gonna stop preaching
[2:38:52.240 --> 2:38:58.480]  i'm sorry uh bob real fast and i love you and i want to get uh ambassador keys back on i don't

[2:39:33.760 --> 2:39:38.800]  how do you get it in into the blood into the cells but yeah pretty much wipes out a lot of
[2:39:38.800 --> 2:39:44.160]  communicable stuff no you just activate it and drink it i drank some just a minute ago getting

[2:40:00.960 --> 2:40:04.080]  know i mean i know there's a lot of stuff that really works it's kind of like writers of lost
[2:40:04.080 --> 2:40:09.520]  art where they you know they're gonna hide the ark and it's a whole warehouse of hidden stuff
[2:40:09.520 --> 2:40:17.280]  that's a metaphor for how much amazing stuff is out there anyway tell your people go to uh genesis
[2:40:17.280 --> 2:40:23.280]  to church dot is look at that stuff it's going to become very famous it's going to be all over

[2:40:48.880 --> 2:40:54.720]  okay enough of that enough of me uh huh babbling parrot aren't uh let's go to
[2:40:57.360 --> 2:41:05.840]  leticia into mexico leticia you're up next thanks for holding hi elix hi are you i'm i'm pretty freaked
[2:41:05.840 --> 2:41:13.040]  out quite frankly okay well i am too but i got my my storable food so i feel good about that
[2:41:13.920 --> 2:41:20.080]  and um also i was going to ask you for the water purifier which one is better the the
[2:41:20.080 --> 2:41:27.200]  alexa or the the procure they're they're apples and oranges there's thousands of chemicals out
[2:41:27.200 --> 2:41:33.760]  there and we just went out and found out well well we did with the with the procure we went out and
[2:41:33.760 --> 2:41:38.320]  said okay what's the highest rated uh for a good price because there's some that are even higher
[2:41:38.320 --> 2:41:43.120]  rated but they're like three times more and it depends on the type and how they do it in the test
[2:41:44.240 --> 2:41:47.440]  this filter will be better at this better than that but the point is they all cut basically
[2:41:47.440 --> 2:41:52.800]  everything down to 99.999 some things are not detectable and so you're you're trying to look at
[2:41:52.800 --> 2:41:57.440]  the the test to figure out which one's better it's apples and oranges because the numbers are so so
[2:41:57.440 --> 2:42:03.040]  tiny but these these these tests and spectrometers and things are so accurate that they can pick
[2:42:03.040 --> 2:42:07.680]  stuff up down to the molecule size but a lot of things are non-detectable which means wow
[2:42:07.680 --> 2:42:12.960]  you know the super expensive a million dollar equipment can't find it and and and so um there's
[2:42:12.960 --> 2:42:17.200]  really apples and oranges uh i know that they understood how important it was in their mission
[2:42:17.200 --> 2:42:23.360]  at my patriot supply when they got really successful about five years in to go out and uh produce what
[2:42:23.360 --> 2:42:28.720]  they believe was the best most affordable water filtration system and so that's the big one we
[2:42:28.720 --> 2:42:33.440]  promote but but pro pure is just as good in my view and that's why we have both of them i mean
[2:42:33.440 --> 2:42:38.080]  look i'll sell 10 brands if they're top top of the line uh but stay there i'm gonna come right back
[2:42:38.080 --> 2:42:43.680]  to you leticia we're gonna go bam bam bam we gotta go quick because just just we've got uh
[2:42:43.680 --> 2:42:49.280]  john rapford i think's coming up he's coming up right we we've got rapping board popping in all
[2:42:49.280 --> 2:42:56.240]  right well they're right back stay with us i've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers
[2:42:56.240 --> 2:43:03.200]  win four wars your support and your help in rebooting americana is a challenge to the globalist
[2:43:03.200 --> 2:43:08.640]  system of corporate tyranny has really caught hold not just here in the u.s but worldwide and
[2:43:08.640 --> 2:43:14.720]  president trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting americana and basic liberty is amazing
[2:43:14.720 --> 2:43:20.160]  as well he's still lacking on the big tech uh censorship taking action against that in some
[2:43:20.160 --> 2:43:24.800]  other areas but trying to end the wars boosting our economy speaking out against communist china
[2:43:24.800 --> 2:43:31.200]  trump's been doing an amazing job but now more than ever we really have to realize that we're
[2:43:31.200 --> 2:43:36.720]  being targeted because we are effective and the globalists are beginning to lose their war
[2:43:37.520 --> 2:43:41.440]  against humanity in a big way and so we're gonna see some major fireworks out of them
[2:43:41.440 --> 2:43:47.280]  but it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us
[2:43:47.280 --> 2:43:52.480]  that's an attempt to demoralize us we've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy
[2:43:52.480 --> 2:43:59.040]  well it's here the year 2020 world government's out in the open we've got the predicted mass
[2:43:59.040 --> 2:44:04.560]  pandemics and they're calling for global government as the answer and we've got massive huge censorship
[2:44:04.560 --> 2:44:11.280]  taking place it's coordinated by big tech and banks against people that promote america and guns
[2:44:11.280 --> 2:44:17.440]  and freedom and jesus and the family and the protection of the unborn wow yes now we know
[2:44:17.440 --> 2:44:22.080]  we're right the new world order is real satanism is real the pedophile a leader real but we're
[2:44:22.080 --> 2:44:26.640]  real as well and we love god and we're standing up and saying no but i just want to make the point
[2:44:26.640 --> 2:44:32.560]  here one month into 2020 that we have never been in cancels we have never been in some smallville
[2:44:32.560 --> 2:44:38.320]  place that didn't matter everything we do every decision we make governs the future of our species
[2:44:38.320 --> 2:44:41.440]  and everything we've gone through and everything we're gonna go through so it's an incredible
[2:44:41.440 --> 2:44:46.160]  time to be alive i'm gonna thank you all for being aware and being involved but just remember
[2:44:46.160 --> 2:44:52.320]  your action now via prayer word of mouth and financial support of m4 short com is critical so

[2:47:32.400 --> 2:47:45.760]  plagues there was a virus killed three of my family six years ago what was that nightmare year
[2:47:45.760 --> 2:47:56.560]  2014 december end of january three people i loved a lot died my mom's brother was really a cool guy
[2:47:58.720 --> 2:48:05.920]  look like poppy dead in the door down his son dead in the door down and across the street
[2:48:05.920 --> 2:48:14.720]  my dad's older cousin called him an uncle another patriot amazing guy
[2:48:17.600 --> 2:48:17.920]  dead
[2:48:22.000 --> 2:48:26.880]  oh they're really cool people who weren't defined by the army officers and the secret stuff they
[2:48:26.880 --> 2:48:32.800]  did for this country were defined by being christians they went home to meet god
[2:48:32.800 --> 2:48:38.000]  and i watched him cover it the callers were calling everywhere everybody was everybody's
[2:48:38.000 --> 2:48:41.840]  family was dying all in the damn country but really the midwest and texas in the south
[2:48:44.400 --> 2:48:48.240]  and i talked to doctors they said yeah it's a really deadly virus and that there's a cdc cover
[2:48:48.240 --> 2:48:54.480]  up so they covered that up i lost three people just like you lost people pissed me off didn't
[2:48:54.480 --> 2:48:59.280]  hear a damn word out of the cdc of the national moves now they're running around like it's the
[2:48:59.280 --> 2:49:13.040]  end of the world i don't know i just know that it's contrived in the russians are saying exactly
[2:49:13.600 --> 2:49:19.120]  what the french and the chinese and the us and the canadiens and the australians and the mexicans
[2:49:19.120 --> 2:49:31.040]  are saying they never do that they're on the same page and that's what concerns me the most
[2:49:33.120 --> 2:49:35.280]  some really sophisticated calculus going on here
[2:49:38.640 --> 2:49:40.080]  the chi-coms funded
[2:49:42.640 --> 2:49:46.560]  the move against trump through hollywood but it was the globalist using china as a base that really
[2:49:46.560 --> 2:49:52.320]  did it and they wanted to embarrass the president america during this period
[2:49:54.400 --> 2:50:00.400]  and then this virus shows up that embarrasses china and it is a bio weapon it's definitely
[2:50:00.400 --> 2:50:07.280]  been engineered it's out of nowhere it's extremely mutinogenic it it's a scary virus
[2:50:07.280 --> 2:50:12.240]  because of how communicable it is alone and the fact that it is mutating fast that's confirmed
[2:50:12.240 --> 2:50:17.680]  russia's closed its borders with china
[2:50:23.280 --> 2:50:26.160]  you know they've got cases in russia russia just won't announce it
[2:50:28.880 --> 2:50:32.160]  so i don't know but i know this
[2:50:34.480 --> 2:50:37.600]  there's a disturbance in the force you could feel it
[2:50:37.600 --> 2:50:45.040]  that's just george lucas his cheesy name for the spirit but everybody knows it's true
[2:50:46.080 --> 2:50:50.640]  so the question is what is it john raport will be popping in to continue with your calls right
[2:50:50.640 --> 2:50:57.200]  now leticia virus active in the usa we said that two days ago that's not rocket science it's confirmed
[2:50:58.080 --> 2:51:02.320]  we got vice attacking us oh they claim the virus is out in the us and wrote the containment
[2:51:02.320 --> 2:51:07.840]  well two days later it's confirmed again vice a moron a monkey could tell you that
[2:51:10.400 --> 2:51:15.840]  yeah well this monkey i i've noticed that people um around me they're they have to
[2:51:15.840 --> 2:51:23.200]  hold the flu it's lasting a month not just a week or and that's what i that's what i'm noticing
[2:51:23.200 --> 2:51:33.200]  are you seeing increased long-term uh respiratory stuff that's what i'm seeing in austin yes i am yes
[2:51:33.200 --> 2:51:40.080]  oh man that's this is me off what do you think's going on what's your gut tell you
[2:51:40.960 --> 2:51:47.920]  well it is it it is um here in the u.s and i believe that we just got to be prepared and
[2:51:47.920 --> 2:51:54.560]  i just wanted to share psalm 91 with you okay go ahead and read that it's pretty comforting okay
[2:51:56.880 --> 2:52:01.600]  absolutely we should pull up that song on the screen thank you leticia thank you
[2:52:02.240 --> 2:52:07.760]  you know it's like when kobe brian died says a good guy says a bad guy so many women have
[2:52:07.760 --> 2:52:11.520]  falsely accused people that when real women have stuff bad happen to them people don't believe it
[2:52:12.320 --> 2:52:16.960]  but didn't matter it was a guy we all knew and was a good-looking guy well-spoken at a great
[2:52:16.960 --> 2:52:22.320]  you know family and he's dead so it touches us because we get hey we could be dead
[2:52:25.520 --> 2:52:28.960]  and that's why i thought people make a jokes about it you know was sick i mean they they've
[2:52:28.960 --> 2:52:36.640]  got their free speech i'm just saying because you know that makes me when i fly with my children
[2:52:37.280 --> 2:52:44.800]  more scared like because i'm not scared of them i'm not scared of dying at all i think it's a problem
[2:52:44.800 --> 2:52:54.400]  i have that i'm reckless but my children though i've had to spiritually make the decision that
[2:52:54.400 --> 2:52:58.880]  even though they come after them i'm not backing down and it's not a form of guilt but if i have
[2:52:58.880 --> 2:53:07.200]  guilt for anything in my life it's that my children have to be drug into this for this fight but you
[2:53:07.200 --> 2:53:14.800]  know what the globalists drug them into it not me and it doesn't make me mad the globalists are
[2:53:14.800 --> 2:53:18.800]  lying about me and trying to plant child porn on us and do it all the crap you see in the news every
[2:53:18.800 --> 2:53:27.360]  day because it's hurting me it it hurts me that these people exist and haven't been defeated and
[2:53:27.360 --> 2:53:34.320]  crushed i don't want them off my back because they're on my back i want them off my back because
[2:53:34.320 --> 2:53:40.960]  they're on all of our backs and it's pathetic that we have to let this go on and it makes me feel
[2:53:40.960 --> 2:53:46.720]  it's it makes me feel ashamed that i haven't been strong enough or worked hard enough
[2:53:48.080 --> 2:53:52.000]  so people like bloominthal can do these evil things and get away with it i think he's so
[2:53:52.000 --> 2:53:57.600]  freaking powerful and he's invincible he's not and god almighty in the name of jesus christ
[2:53:57.600 --> 2:54:06.640]  will serve him justice it is going to be done and then i watch that snake slithering around
[2:54:06.640 --> 2:54:12.160]  lying about ram paul saying he's a criminal you're the criminal you're the enemy
[2:54:13.920 --> 2:54:22.320]  not ram paul a good decent man anybody can see that knows ram paul's a real man you're not you're
[2:54:22.320 --> 2:54:33.600]  not even a man bloominthal you're a damn demon everybody knows it by the way my anger is not
[2:54:33.600 --> 2:54:41.120]  of weakness it's of strength like a volcano and they know it too and it's a spirit they don't
[2:54:41.120 --> 2:54:45.840]  like it's a spirit that will overcome them it's a spirit that will defeat them it's a spirit
[2:54:45.840 --> 2:54:50.240]  they will never dominate no matter how much poison they put in the food and water no matter what they
[2:54:50.240 --> 2:54:59.360]  pull god will defeat them and their 1984 system is going to burn
[2:55:02.080 --> 2:55:08.960]  man i'm gonna stop the big stuff's happening on the planet you can feel it you can see it
[2:55:08.960 --> 2:55:12.880]  and i'm not going to belabor this but it's like a horse in carriage we've got the best
[2:55:12.880 --> 2:55:17.360]  horrible food we've got it in stock it's high quality seven to ten days because they got the

[2:55:33.760 --> 2:55:37.680]  they're they're proud to be with us i mean i'm gonna get into the lore of they had a whole
[2:55:37.680 --> 2:55:42.400]  corporate attempted takeover because they were supporting us and they defeated the takeover
[2:55:42.400 --> 2:55:47.760]  years ago they've been through the the the espionage the attacks to be with us okay and i
[2:55:47.760 --> 2:55:51.360]  they don't want that even said but it's not a secret but i'm just gonna tell you that's who

[2:56:12.240 --> 2:56:17.440]  fight that's the same thing you see same thing with the food it's like having blood in your veins
[2:56:17.440 --> 2:56:21.920]  and you know you're not dependent and it's that type of move having that base covered
[2:56:21.920 --> 2:56:26.240]  then all the other things that's how god works i've learned you do the basic things god says
[2:56:26.240 --> 2:56:32.640]  make provision get prepared have things laid away so that you aren't dependent it's like moses

[2:56:40.560 --> 2:56:49.760]  was that jake or somebody i can't remember it all runs together oh it's unbelievable

[3:06:18.880 --> 3:06:23.120]  bad but you're not happy he died you're happy we're still here we've got children he's got
[3:06:23.120 --> 3:06:27.280]  children we're we're moving forward we're so alive what matters is the species
[3:06:29.120 --> 3:06:33.200]  there's no one will say the fact the media might spend it jones says he's happy kobe brian died
[3:06:33.200 --> 3:06:38.960]  that's not what i said but it's that weird feeling when you're burying the grandparent or the parent
[3:06:38.960 --> 3:06:42.720]  or somebody else and it's been horrible and it was terrible but you know they're with god now
[3:06:42.720 --> 3:06:47.600]  after they die the pain leaves a lot of it leaves because because you know they're in a better place
[3:06:47.600 --> 3:06:52.720]  but you also know they're still alive right here my grandfather's my grandmother's they're right
[3:06:53.280 --> 3:06:59.920]  here right now and i got children that tree that old tree got struck by lightning there's 20 trees
[3:06:59.920 --> 3:07:06.000]  around it that it's its babies and that's god's circle of life that's the beauty of it and you buy
[3:07:06.000 --> 3:07:10.400]  into that you buy into yourself you buy into reality and now the satanism doesn't matter anymore
[3:07:10.400 --> 3:07:14.320]  the selfishness of believing it's all gotta be about you and you've got to dominate reality you've
[3:07:14.320 --> 3:07:20.320]  got to be god because you're afraid to die when you never die john rapaport i feel the energy the
[3:07:20.320 --> 3:07:24.960]  crew feels that the callers all feel it i don't know if it's this virus the economy the the senate
[3:07:24.960 --> 3:07:31.280]  trial something big's happening in the first month of 2020 here on january 20th do you agree with me
[3:07:31.280 --> 3:07:38.880]  and what is it well i've been following all of this business with the the grand epidemic of all times
[3:07:38.880 --> 3:07:44.880]  and as people know i've researched fraudulent epidemics for years exposed them one at a time
[3:07:45.280 --> 3:07:50.960]  every one of them was going to end the species forever we wouldn't be here talking about it if
[3:07:50.960 --> 3:07:57.680]  they really were true at the time and so yes i have my grave doubts about this one too but the
[3:07:57.680 --> 3:08:03.680]  thing that i don't doubt and this is what people have to realize is the hammer every time is the
[3:08:03.680 --> 3:08:10.960]  time is the vaccine and this is major because at least two experimental vaccines are being rushed
[3:08:10.960 --> 3:08:18.400]  into production possibly within the next 90 days and neither of these has ever been tried openly
[3:08:18.400 --> 3:08:26.000]  on the public before for public use they're both experimental the entire planet will be a guinea
[3:08:26.000 --> 3:08:32.960]  pig they're going to stand back and see and one of these i'm going to boil it right down one of these
[3:08:32.960 --> 3:08:41.440]  is the big challenge is the immune system of the body goes haywire and starts attacking itself
[3:08:42.480 --> 3:08:51.840]  war against the body by the body that's called the the adverse effect of the rna vaccine that is
[3:08:51.840 --> 3:08:58.880]  being rushed into production in the united states the other big one is the dna vaccine which is also
[3:08:58.880 --> 3:09:08.160]  being rushed into production and this one as confirmed on march 15 19 uh 2015 by the new york
[3:09:08.160 --> 3:09:16.400]  times alters the genetic makeup of every person who takes it they don't have to put in secret
[3:09:16.400 --> 3:09:24.800]  bio weapons and all kinds of just the vaccine itself dna vaccine admittedly permanently alters
[3:09:24.800 --> 3:09:29.520]  your dna genetic struggle you have another name for that it's basically cancer and so what you're
[3:09:29.520 --> 3:09:34.080]  saying is they go look at the left hand don't look at the right hand or don't look at the right hand
[3:09:34.080 --> 3:09:39.680]  look at the left hand exactly the hammer is the vaccine and they metaphysically explain this because
[3:09:39.680 --> 3:09:43.680]  this is this is deep i know you've studied this i've read some of your books you've got a great
[3:09:43.680 --> 3:09:49.120]  insight on it's true they need us to bring our children ourselves and do it metaphysically that
[3:09:49.120 --> 3:09:53.360]  they need us to give our children the mohawk and the bible says give not your children the fires of
[3:09:53.360 --> 3:10:00.560]  mohawk why do they need us to acquiesce and and and to come to them well because it amuses them
[3:10:00.560 --> 3:10:04.880]  basically alex i mean i can't think of any other reason beyond that because they're evil
[3:10:05.520 --> 3:10:12.880]  because it cheers them up to see what they would consider complete idiots bringing themselves
[3:10:12.880 --> 3:10:18.880]  and their children to be destroyed i mean it's as simple as that that's how they get their kicks
[3:10:18.880 --> 3:10:22.560]  it's the ultimate power trip that you'll bring your daughter or son to be thrown into a fire
[3:10:22.560 --> 3:10:26.800]  fiery furnace or to give them stuff that they admittedly can kill them but but but but we lie
[3:10:26.800 --> 3:10:32.560]  to you yeah we don't even have to force you to do it you know yes we can mandate it and so forth
[3:10:32.560 --> 3:10:39.120]  but really what we're looking for is you volunteer you go along and the other big thing that i've
[3:10:39.120 --> 3:10:44.000]  got to get back that up five seconds this is a fascist film made by the father of fascism
[3:10:44.000 --> 3:10:48.480]  miscellaneous Hitler a devil works for put it on screen for TV viewers notice those are real naked
[3:10:48.480 --> 3:10:53.440]  children they've got up there on screen and they're having to comfort them and get them to not fight
[3:10:53.440 --> 3:10:58.160]  back and and and agree to be thrown in notice the high the priest is comforting the children
[3:10:58.160 --> 3:11:02.800]  who are really crying and little two-year-olds in front of this giant crowd a boy and girl
[3:11:02.800 --> 3:11:07.760]  that they are about to simulate the murder of and the word is actual killings went on that was not
[3:11:07.760 --> 3:11:11.680]  fake rituals they were killing them behind the scenes which again is bohemian grove the same
[3:11:11.680 --> 3:11:16.160]  repeat sorry john i just want to say as above so below what you're just saying right there
[3:11:16.160 --> 3:11:20.240]  is is in evidence they see us as children and they want us in the final moment to say
[3:11:20.240 --> 3:11:24.160]  he's like you're going up you're going up and they get the kids don't cry don't cry
[3:11:24.160 --> 3:11:31.920]  and have their own parent murder them absolutely absolutely good at you sorry okay so the other
[3:11:31.920 --> 3:11:39.440]  big point that i want to get to here which is very vital is isn't it funny isn't it strange
[3:11:39.440 --> 3:11:45.120]  and some people would say very fortunate that all of a sudden this quote outbreak happens
[3:11:45.120 --> 3:11:51.040]  in a country that has one of the most if not the most brutal regime ultimately in the world
[3:11:51.040 --> 3:11:57.680]  where they can lock down 40 million people overnight and they can put on all kinds of
[3:11:57.680 --> 3:12:05.200]  repressive restrictions this is all a giant martial law drill exactly a giant planetary thing
[3:12:05.200 --> 3:12:13.600]  and here's the deal china is being positioned as the icebreaker okay the psychological icebreaker
[3:12:13.600 --> 3:12:22.080]  because no time in human history has ever 40 million people been quarantined all once overnight
[3:12:22.080 --> 3:12:28.880]  so people are standing on the sidelines including the head of the un who is bowing down today and
[3:12:28.880 --> 3:12:35.360]  tweets to the chinese premier for his quote interventions and measures and so on and so
[3:12:35.360 --> 3:12:42.240]  forth to say people all over the world are saying boy aren't we lucky isn't this fantastic that it
[3:12:42.240 --> 3:12:47.280]  happened in china john rapaport you have just nailed it that's what i said this morning but you've
[3:12:47.280 --> 3:12:52.320]  said it better this is a giant global government drill in china the most controlled place to sell
[3:12:52.320 --> 3:12:56.720]  everybody on planetary martial law for future real outbreaks they're going to bring forward
[3:12:57.360 --> 3:13:04.720]  exactly so in the us okay state of emergency all right well we china did it so well we have to do
[3:13:04.720 --> 3:13:10.240]  it too we'll do it differently sure okay people can't travel here don't travel there we're going
[3:13:10.240 --> 3:13:15.040]  to vaccinate all these people over here and stay in your houses and we're going to cancel some
[3:13:15.040 --> 3:13:20.320]  concerts sporting events whatever an anti-vaxxer you need to be arrested because you're creating
[3:13:20.320 --> 3:13:29.440]  fear about the solution you're bad yeah of course if you know if suddenly they say everybody here
[3:13:29.440 --> 3:13:34.960]  has to get the vaccine then somebody shows up and says no no no no don't do this don't do this
[3:13:34.960 --> 3:13:41.120]  don't do this then you know he could get a visit knock knock knock on the door yeah you bet sure
[3:13:41.120 --> 3:13:46.000]  which they've been pre-programming and censoring all the anti-vaxxers in the biggest blitzkrieg
[3:13:46.000 --> 3:13:50.160]  we've ever seen i mean orders of magnitude a hundred times bigger i mean it's been shut everybody
[3:13:50.160 --> 3:13:55.920]  down ban natural news sign all these secret documents against them for his aunt crazy hell
[3:13:55.920 --> 3:13:58.880]  breaking with us folks we're not making a big deal about it because it's about the show and
[3:13:58.880 --> 3:14:02.880]  fight me loblas but it's like we're under attacks burning buildings you know they're coming over
[3:14:02.880 --> 3:14:06.960]  the top right now we're just at the you know broadcasting which shows us like i said a few
[3:14:06.960 --> 3:14:10.640]  weeks ago i don't know what's about to happen but the censorship the attacks have never hit this
[3:14:10.640 --> 3:14:19.120]  level something big's coming and now here it is major global drill test case people all over the
[3:14:19.120 --> 3:14:23.840]  world saying well you know china broke the ice we've never seen anything like this isn't it
[3:14:23.840 --> 3:14:29.680]  wonderful fantastic they're clamping down we're gonna have to do the same thing and so Germany
[3:14:29.680 --> 3:14:34.800]  decides england decides whatever somebody in africa decides other countries start following
[3:14:34.800 --> 3:14:40.000]  suit and of course one of the biggest winners in all of this is the world health organization
[3:14:40.000 --> 3:14:46.400]  because they are the medical enforcement arm of the united nations and they rule the medical
[3:14:46.400 --> 3:14:52.000]  world which means everybody they can say to a country you're not going to clamp down on people
[3:14:52.000 --> 3:14:56.960]  you're not going to institute an emergency and lockdown and quarantine well we're going to
[3:14:56.960 --> 3:15:02.080]  bring economic sanctions against you we're going to tell people they can't travel to your that's
[3:15:02.080 --> 3:15:06.880]  right this is the coming out of world government the power of world government to crush the nation
[3:15:06.880 --> 3:15:12.240]  state we must all come together and maybe that's why trumps waited to jump into the hysteria
[3:15:12.240 --> 3:15:17.920]  because he understands what's happening yes i mean that's exactly it this is the ultimate
[3:15:17.920 --> 3:15:24.000]  collectivist nightmare you see but they've been preparing us for the groundwork groundwork where
[3:15:24.000 --> 3:15:30.960]  we're all glued together in one giant cheese glob of humanity there are no individuals no free choice
[3:15:30.960 --> 3:15:37.920]  no nothing like that forget it and now we have the medical emergency of all time so everybody
[3:15:37.920 --> 3:15:45.760]  must be as one and get the vaccine and shut up and then that'll fix the problem absolutely and
[3:15:45.760 --> 3:15:50.560]  now see it all we can all have seizures like baron if we get our shots they're right back

[3:18:56.320 --> 3:19:01.200]  except for maybe the last week and a half and um i told alex i said man this is the best toothpaste
[3:19:01.200 --> 3:19:04.640]  i've ever tried he's like well what are you doing just sitting in here telling me you got to get up
[3:19:04.640 --> 3:19:11.200]  there and tell people and oh so here i am telling people super silver whitening toothpaste is by far
[3:19:11.200 --> 3:19:15.680]  the best toothpaste i've ever tried and i'm 45 years old and i've tried a lot of different
[3:19:15.680 --> 3:19:21.200]  toothpaste and it's fluoride free i think the big difference the game changer in this is the coral
[3:19:21.200 --> 3:19:26.800]  calcium because after i brush my teeth with this they feel so clean and the toothpaste that i don't
[3:19:26.800 --> 3:19:32.800]  even like rinse out my mouth after i brush my teeth with this it feels so good it feels like it feels
[3:19:32.800 --> 3:19:39.360]  like good things are happening in my mouth in fact i find myself brushing my teeth three to four
[3:19:39.360 --> 3:19:47.200]  times a day rather than just twice a day now because i like the way it feels
[3:19:47.200 --> 3:20:01.040]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:01.040 --> 3:20:12.880]  you
[3:20:14.400 --> 3:20:16.880]  is this planet the giant sanitarium
[3:20:18.640 --> 3:20:26.880]  welcome to where time stands still no one leaves and no one will
[3:20:26.880 --> 3:20:32.560]  i was like 11 years old this song came out
[3:20:37.040 --> 3:20:42.000]  welcome to where time stands still no one leaves no one will
[3:20:44.000 --> 3:20:47.840]  john raport's our guest you got some calls i'm gonna get to coming up matt bracken
[3:20:47.840 --> 3:20:57.680]  don't call us with him get this perspective
[3:21:00.400 --> 3:21:04.640]  so john raport i hope you'll call us some will be next week because i i i just
[3:21:04.640 --> 3:21:09.520]  love you to death and nobody's nailed it in a 10 minute 10 and a half minute segment like you just
[3:21:09.520 --> 3:21:15.200]  did that was it i called the producer this morning at 7 a.m and she answered and i said
[3:21:15.200 --> 3:21:19.920]  i think this is a big drill she goes yeah no i mean i'm watching foreign tv all the different
[3:21:19.920 --> 3:21:26.240]  channels and she said i've seen the exact same thing you never see that and i said yeah and and
[3:21:26.240 --> 3:21:31.680]  so everybody feels this is big because it is what this the rollout of this is big the vaccine and
[3:21:31.680 --> 3:21:35.360]  what they're gonna do is big and how they admit this vaccine which they've already got ready
[3:21:35.360 --> 3:21:39.680]  obviously they say oh it's not ready yet to make you beg for it and then right when coronavirus
[3:21:39.680 --> 3:21:45.440]  peaks in china in three months and five months here oh oh please oh give it to me man well
[3:21:45.440 --> 3:21:48.880]  they know there's a bunch of other pneumonias and flues killing people and they just hype up each of
[3:21:48.880 --> 3:21:53.760]  in this is a psyop and so now i'm kind of like why is trump not declared an emergency why is
[3:21:53.760 --> 3:21:59.440]  trump not blocked things if it's so deadly and then i think maybe because he doesn't want to add
[3:21:59.440 --> 3:22:04.960]  to the hype maybe because he's not in control of this and he knows it's a larger plan let's
[3:22:04.960 --> 3:22:10.000]  unwind that because i think we're getting close to the problem here uh john which i'm not kissing
[3:22:10.000 --> 3:22:15.200]  your ass it's just like to hear you lay it out you my whole brain with all the facts i have go
[3:22:15.200 --> 3:22:19.440]  ding ding ding ding ding ding ding that's it and sure i could hype up fear of this virus all
[3:22:19.440 --> 3:22:24.480]  day to sell storeable food people eat storeable food anyways for 2020 and all the craziness it
[3:22:24.480 --> 3:22:29.680]  more than ever but i want to believe that this virus isn't as deadly as they're saying but what
[3:22:29.680 --> 3:22:35.280]  i do know is whether it's really deadly or not the response to what we're seeing has n w o written
[3:22:35.280 --> 3:22:41.920]  all over is that accurate you bet absolutely and here's what i think about trump he knows or he's
[3:22:41.920 --> 3:22:49.120]  being told listen if you don't declare an emergency the kind of emergency that the world health
[3:22:49.120 --> 3:22:54.880]  organization wants you to declare guess what's going to happen this is going to be five new cases
[3:22:54.880 --> 3:23:02.320]  announced here in the state of washington and then 17 in Nebraska and then 60 in new jersey
[3:23:02.320 --> 3:23:07.440]  and they're going to just keep building these announcements true false doesn't matter until
[3:23:07.440 --> 3:23:14.880]  you're against the wall you're in the corner you look like the guy who just refused to save lives
[3:23:14.880 --> 3:23:20.880]  and so you better do it now you've got to declare it soon very soon now on some form or another
[3:23:20.880 --> 3:23:27.200]  because otherwise they're just going to roll over you and that's the way they do it
[3:23:28.880 --> 3:23:32.880]  build up the number of k okay we just discovered this now there's more here there's more there
[3:23:32.880 --> 3:23:37.840]  what are you going to do mr president we found 16 travelers who are going on planes we don't
[3:23:37.840 --> 3:23:41.840]  know where they are what are you going to do you should have done this months ago what's the
[3:23:41.840 --> 3:23:47.760]  matter with you you're a killer etc etc etc and when you start doing this in a medical arena
[3:23:47.760 --> 3:23:55.200]  man people really respond really respond no i totally agree as a father i'm like well the
[3:23:55.200 --> 3:23:59.600]  russians are blocking their borders and and the and all these other countries trump why aren't you
[3:23:59.600 --> 3:24:06.000]  doing it but now we start to see the wisdom of trump he's figuring out that during the trial
[3:24:06.000 --> 3:24:14.000]  they're pulling this a bunch of planets of a land john right during the trial during the trial
[3:24:14.000 --> 3:24:20.800]  so if during the trial he decides to hold off on this long enough and the trial goes on long
[3:24:20.800 --> 3:24:27.040]  enough he's going to be put into a fantastic squeeze play i mean it's just the walls are
[3:24:27.040 --> 3:24:30.880]  going to close because declaring an emergency is not going to do anything it's already here we know
[3:24:30.880 --> 3:24:39.120]  it's been here yeah i mean true false fake real whatever the emergency is a fate of complete
[3:24:39.120 --> 3:24:44.160]  they've already declared it world health organization and so holding back because i kept
[3:24:44.160 --> 3:24:47.520]  saying why is he doing it and people are going to ask well why at the start of the show are you
[3:24:47.520 --> 3:24:52.480]  upset maybe with trump and now you're not i'm sussing it out we're there's no one giving us
[3:24:52.480 --> 3:24:58.000]  orders there folks just like you're figuring stuff out this is a real discussion yeah because
[3:24:58.880 --> 3:25:05.040]  maybe he's being told by somebody hey listen this is not real this is not what everybody
[3:25:05.040 --> 3:25:11.520]  says it is this is a planetary drill basically what's happening that china is doing just what
[3:25:11.520 --> 3:25:17.200]  we're talking about here i mean it's possible that somebody close to him is saying that to him
[3:25:17.200 --> 3:25:24.960]  and he's saying don't follow suit don't bring down the hammer don't suddenly say for example
[3:25:24.960 --> 3:25:31.440]  everybody's got to take this vaccine you know what happens when that happens right from personal
[3:25:31.440 --> 3:25:37.280]  experience don't do it and so he's holding back and holding back and holding back but
[3:25:38.000 --> 3:25:42.560]  i don't see how he's going to be able to hold back much longer i mean he's going to have to say
[3:25:42.560 --> 3:25:48.240]  something he's going to have to say all right so the silence is deafening right now
[3:25:48.960 --> 3:25:56.640]  yeah absolutely everybody else declared an emergency the un has and the president of the
[3:25:56.640 --> 3:26:02.080]  u.s the biggest destination for chinese on the planet has said nothing while they're welding
[3:26:02.080 --> 3:26:10.480]  the apartment building shut in china yeah i mean he's look people love trump they hate trump i don't
[3:26:10.480 --> 3:26:18.560]  care which it is i think the guy it's a simple answer is he's suspicious you know he's sitting
[3:26:18.560 --> 3:26:22.400]  in the white house and he's looking at all this and he's suspicious no that's it he doesn't want to
[3:26:22.400 --> 3:26:26.800]  join the satanist club he's his own man and he knows there are a bunch of liars so he's watching
[3:26:26.800 --> 3:26:34.240]  this closely yeah i mean who wouldn't you know accept the tool of the operation somebody who's
[3:26:34.240 --> 3:26:40.480]  totally in on the operation from the get go and and is given direct orders on what to do
[3:26:40.480 --> 3:26:44.880]  anybody else is going to sit there or in the white house in their house and they're going to think
[3:26:45.920 --> 3:26:51.840]  what's going on what's happening isn't it amazing that this happened in china
[3:26:51.840 --> 3:26:56.880]  where they can suddenly quarantine 40 million people overnight and this is a drill and now you
[3:26:56.880 --> 3:27:03.040]  know that and and and the congruency of all the countries off the un system this is the planetary
[3:27:03.040 --> 3:27:08.640]  rocket filler system it's all the exact words the exact same order you never this this is the big
[3:27:08.640 --> 3:27:15.120]  first planetary drill ever yeah i mean it's never happened before i don't care i mean you know
[3:27:15.120 --> 3:27:21.520]  quarantines actually go back a long way in history for various reasons and trumped up ideas and this
[3:27:21.520 --> 3:27:27.120]  and that where you would get your enemy whoever the enemy army is and you would put some kind of a
[3:27:27.120 --> 3:27:32.480]  quarantine on them and everybody would be afraid to go near them i mean this is not a new thing
[3:27:32.480 --> 3:27:38.240]  here let's explain on that how are they going to counter the end of globalism the global awakening
[3:27:38.240 --> 3:27:43.680]  that the un has said and rock a fellow they all said we'll use pandemics and now we're seeing the
[3:27:43.680 --> 3:27:48.960]  response now we're seeing and then you know oh we stopped it with inoculations a year from now
[3:27:48.960 --> 3:27:53.920]  oh and the infinitely world government came together what some of the nation states you can
[3:27:53.920 --> 3:28:00.160]  hear the npr voice for the or or the uh yeah you know shell on pbs what some countries didn't
[3:28:00.160 --> 3:28:05.280]  like president trump and then it got out of control and you can see them trying to script this whole
[3:28:05.280 --> 3:28:11.600]  deal yeah this is what happened to them you know the ones that stayed on the outside and refused
[3:28:11.600 --> 3:28:18.000]  to join uh world's community because then the globalists will release bio weapons in those
[3:28:18.000 --> 3:28:24.000]  countries and say it's this that's how you launch a bio attack is you have the simulation but then
[3:28:24.000 --> 3:28:30.720]  those that don't submit you release a real attack sure why not apps you got to attack the ones who
[3:28:30.720 --> 3:28:35.200]  stay on the outside we just did it again rather port that's why the guests the callers all of us
[3:28:35.200 --> 3:28:40.560]  together all of our coming together two of us on earth god makes us so in heaven we just did it
[3:28:40.560 --> 3:28:45.440]  again you're right global drill first world government drill and trump isn't part of that

[3:33:06.160 --> 3:33:11.680]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex jones show
[3:33:13.360 --> 3:33:19.600]  i hear people talking about about the way we have to live here in this country
[3:33:19.600 --> 3:33:47.760]  you know this virus it sucked a lot of the oxygen out of the room they're trying to get
[3:33:47.760 --> 3:33:52.080]  ran paul arrested i've got all those clips blooming paul all of them for saying to the whistleblower
[3:33:52.080 --> 3:33:55.520]  is that's totally legal and you're supposed to face your accuser we've got
[3:33:58.160 --> 3:34:03.600]  democrats saying oh the western states and the flyover they're all a bunch of idiots white people
[3:34:03.600 --> 3:34:08.160]  are dumbasses and it's white dudes with a black dude saying i'm trying to cause a race war i mean
[3:34:08.160 --> 3:34:16.400]  it's just flagrant and over the top sickness and it's all chicom funded through the globalist the
[3:34:16.400 --> 3:34:22.080]  globalist run china so it's not the china he's fault by the way matt bracken's here we always
[3:34:22.080 --> 3:34:27.760]  appreciate him in fact i hope he'll come on the main show tomorrow and give us his views on things
[3:34:27.760 --> 3:34:31.600]  and we've also got of course on rap report right shotgun and three calls i swore that i'm gonna take
[3:34:31.600 --> 3:34:37.440]  so we'll get to those but matt what is your approximation of this i think rap report knocks
[3:34:37.440 --> 3:34:44.640]  it out of the park i'm seeing unified propaganda out of these governments saying it's it's horrible
[3:34:44.640 --> 3:34:50.560]  it's terrible shut everything down a planetary drill but i'm not seeing that out of trump and
[3:34:50.560 --> 3:34:54.720]  i'm wondering why he's held back with the world health organization that's the un uh for those
[3:34:54.720 --> 3:34:58.800]  that don't know coming out saying it's a global pandemic a big emergency the cases are growing
[3:34:58.800 --> 3:35:05.760]  you know exponentially tenfold all this insanity with all of this going on what is your approximation
[3:35:05.760 --> 3:35:11.520]  while the president is on trial how about planets aligning i mean and what and what's coming next
[3:35:11.520 --> 3:35:18.880]  during this matt well we have very bad data first of all there's nothing that we can really
[3:35:18.880 --> 3:35:24.720]  trust about the numbers you know there's this number called the r not the r zero it's how many
[3:35:24.720 --> 3:35:31.120]  people uh an infected person will infect um before they either die or they're cured and that's been
[3:35:31.120 --> 3:35:35.760]  all over the place and you can't believe it you know no matter what you can't believe the figures
[3:35:35.760 --> 3:35:42.720]  coming out of china if it's really a two to four 14 day incubation period and you can uh transmit
[3:35:42.720 --> 3:35:48.880]  it before you're even symptomatic then it's all it's probably all over the world already um but
[3:35:48.880 --> 3:35:53.280]  we're gonna have to wait and see you know in our own in our own communities how it's spreading in
[3:35:53.280 --> 3:35:58.960]  our own countries because you know it's it's um getting big in philippines it's um there's been uh
[3:35:58.960 --> 3:36:05.520]  uh uh human to human proved transmission in places like korea and germany where people
[3:36:05.520 --> 3:36:10.560]  that have never left germany have got have caught it from a worker who came back from from china
[3:36:10.560 --> 3:36:16.240]  without any symptoms uh so yeah we we're gonna have to wait and see but something that that john
[3:36:16.240 --> 3:36:22.640]  mentioned before you know that the the history of quarantine is actually it's an italian word
[3:36:22.640 --> 3:36:28.560]  and during the black death in the middle ages a couple of italian cities they were very mercantile
[3:36:28.560 --> 3:36:34.400]  you know they were port cities like malan and venice and genoa they put up quarantines where
[3:36:34.400 --> 3:36:40.000]  ships had to stay at anchor for 40 days and then that's right else that the flag was a black spot
[3:36:40.000 --> 3:36:44.960]  on a white flag and they could only come in after the 40 day period that actually worked
[3:36:44.960 --> 3:36:53.440]  during the spanish flu um if in of 1918-19 uh philadelphia was really lagging in any kind of
[3:36:53.440 --> 3:36:58.960]  precautions and they suffered a really bad uh punishment from spanish flu worse than most
[3:36:59.520 --> 3:37:04.800]  and san francisco got out ahead of it with quarantine closed all the military bases
[3:37:05.600 --> 3:37:10.560]  you know before they were there were even breakouts things like that and san francisco had a much
[3:37:10.560 --> 3:37:15.760]  lower rate something important to to learn from the spanish flu because it's probably the closest
[3:37:15.760 --> 3:37:23.200]  approximation of what a maybe a worst case would look like uh is that the the death rate can vary
[3:37:23.200 --> 3:37:30.320]  vary widely from like two percent to 20 percent depending on the mutation well and depending on
[3:37:30.320 --> 3:37:34.640]  on how a community is hit and what kind of precautions they have you know you can get
[3:37:34.640 --> 3:37:40.720]  overtaken to the point where there aren't enough medical people to take care of the patients and
[3:37:43.680 --> 3:37:48.640]  why do you think there's so much lockdown and hysteria compared to other things we've seen
[3:37:48.640 --> 3:37:53.920]  before i mean and the u.n and all this unification of the governments and what they're saying i mean
[3:37:53.920 --> 3:37:58.240]  i mean is it because it's so incredibly horrible or is this like a global government drill like
[3:37:58.240 --> 3:38:04.400]  john remboldt saying two things two things about you know two things about the um why they may know
[3:38:04.400 --> 3:38:11.200]  that it's really horrible one is that is that um whether it's a natural you know snake to bat thing
[3:38:11.760 --> 3:38:18.320]  where he used to humans are used to swine to bird to human and it mutates that he'd stop and then
[3:38:18.320 --> 3:38:24.400]  becomes human to human but the the more far out it is and unrecognizable to humans it is the more
[3:38:24.400 --> 3:38:32.240]  dangerous it is so something that snake to to um a bat which is reptile to mammal this is like an
[3:38:32.240 --> 3:38:38.880]  alien from another galaxy not only another planet compared to uh swine to bird to human which is
[3:38:38.880 --> 3:38:44.800]  what we what we're you know we've we've handled so if it really is but then a lot of people think
[3:38:44.800 --> 3:38:52.240]  it came from canada to the wuhan bio facility and they've engineered parts into it so either way
[3:38:52.880 --> 3:38:56.480]  i think that the world leaders that are getting the classified briefings
[3:38:56.480 --> 3:39:02.560]  they're getting the holy sierra you know drill and uh they may know with this thing having a
[3:39:02.560 --> 3:39:08.640]  two to fourteen day incubation um and and people traveling around the world you look at the i
[3:39:08.640 --> 3:39:15.040]  recommend everybody watch some spanish flu documentaries they're great on on uh on youtube and
[3:39:15.040 --> 3:39:20.960]  learn how overwhelming it can be to a community community um and and that's even trying to do
[3:39:20.960 --> 3:39:25.600]  quarantine but then global government will be the savior let let me ask john raport what he makes of
[3:39:25.600 --> 3:39:31.600]  this uh i i just see the pre-programming ahead of this crescendoing right up to its release
[3:39:31.600 --> 3:39:36.640]  and now i see all this concerted unification of governments uh you know telling me that uh
[3:39:36.640 --> 3:39:41.040]  they've activated some type of big global crisis i mean the un just said that i said from the start
[3:39:41.040 --> 3:39:43.920]  of the show but obviously this has already been activated before they announced it
[3:39:47.440 --> 3:39:51.920]  it is start over sorry they didn't have your mic up go ahead and start over i i started saying
[3:39:51.920 --> 3:39:58.640]  back in the 1980s look the biggest source of collectivism on the planet long term is going to be
[3:39:58.640 --> 3:40:07.280]  medical this is what you have to watch out for they fly no partisan flag they say they are not
[3:40:07.280 --> 3:40:14.880]  left or right or sent we are the healers this is the out front pr this is the way the cartel works
[3:40:14.880 --> 3:40:21.200]  this is the rockefeller modality this is what they've been doing forever as they research on
[3:40:21.200 --> 3:40:27.360]  birth control and serility vaccines they bought up american medicine they killed western medicine
[3:40:27.360 --> 3:40:36.400]  proposed it exactly exactly so you know this is yet another one of these deals because what is it
[3:40:36.400 --> 3:40:42.880]  that collectivizes people more than anything else you give them a threat they can't see the
[3:40:42.880 --> 3:40:47.600]  invisible terrorist little tiny enemy that's lurking and it's going to get in you and you're
[3:40:47.600 --> 3:40:53.680]  going to fall down the street die and we have to do this we all have to come together all nations of
[3:40:53.680 --> 3:41:00.880]  the world must be as one and we are the world health organization leading that call and then
[3:41:00.880 --> 3:41:07.440]  everybody comes together i mean this is the pattern this is the way you form a world government
[3:41:07.440 --> 3:41:13.920]  this is collectivism at its most basic and terrifying to people this is how they respond
[3:41:14.480 --> 3:41:22.480]  this is the operation this is the drill this is the leading edge of other nations shining in
[3:41:22.480 --> 3:41:26.480]  we're going to declare a state emergency this is this is Joseph Mengele's wet dream

[3:41:39.520 --> 3:41:44.560]  gets out of this this gets beyond anybody's control you know if you learn from if you learn
[3:41:44.560 --> 3:41:51.600]  from history if you learn from previous pandemics like in in uh 1918 they weren't exactly ignorant
[3:41:51.600 --> 3:41:55.520]  they had public health they had better public health than we have today in the sense that there
[3:41:55.520 --> 3:42:01.760]  were public health nurses and so forth they could quarantine houses the country in 1918 was very
[3:42:01.760 --> 3:42:07.520]  different than today it was unified and patriotic there was wartime censorship they could order
[3:42:07.520 --> 3:42:13.920]  people and people obeyed the orders that america is gone now we're disunified people already at

[3:42:22.800 --> 3:42:28.640]  or contrived what is the response during hysteria when most people aren't self-sufficient and are

[3:44:06.960 --> 3:44:13.360]  and respiratory function in the 1960s researchers in france noticed that people who ate certain
[3:44:13.360 --> 3:44:19.280]  quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began studying this
[3:44:19.280 --> 3:44:25.280]  effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research a fast-acting
[3:44:25.280 --> 3:44:30.880]  chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms pollen block is natural and
[3:44:30.880 --> 3:44:36.000]  effective it is not an antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually
[3:44:36.000 --> 3:44:41.760]  acts by blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory
[3:44:41.760 --> 3:44:48.000]  responses in the body go outside and enjoy the air you breathe head to infowarslife.com

[3:47:02.000 --> 3:47:10.880]  no
[3:47:12.000 --> 3:47:18.880]  producing the human talking point a blueprint not programmed by some globalists
[3:47:19.600 --> 3:47:26.160]  getting transmissions from the bad guys we're getting transmissions from the big guy
[3:47:27.120 --> 3:47:30.080]  and we've already pretty much figured out what's going on and you know
[3:47:30.080 --> 3:47:38.800]  we're pretty much always right because we are you we are one but we are all individuals in
[3:47:38.800 --> 3:47:44.560]  our spiritual decision to be with god so the collectivists would enslave the individual
[3:47:44.560 --> 3:47:51.200]  would enslave the mass we empower the individual we empower the mass that's the real permutation
[3:47:51.200 --> 3:47:58.400]  the real equation of god's force but you've got to ask for it our good news mike adams who's busier
[3:47:58.400 --> 3:48:04.240]  than a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest is going to be hosting the first hour of the
[3:48:04.240 --> 3:48:09.760]  war room in t-minus 10 minutes then john raports could take an hour break he's gonna be back loaded
[3:48:09.760 --> 3:48:13.280]  for bear with this big you an announcement of the global pandemic that we told you
[3:48:13.280 --> 3:48:17.920]  headline yesterday was that it's a worldwide emergency pandemic from their perspective
[3:48:17.920 --> 3:48:21.920]  already had that two days ago mike adams had separate people telling what they're getting
[3:48:21.920 --> 3:48:26.480]  ready for on the west coast maybe he'll tell you what he knows he advised me not to go with
[3:48:26.480 --> 3:48:30.800]  what i had two days ago but i i respect him so i took that countenance and
[3:48:33.360 --> 3:48:36.720]  i mean there's not much more i know from those sources i probably need to get on the telephone
[3:48:37.280 --> 3:48:42.080]  that's something i probably should do i mean i can i can get ahold of people if i need to and
[3:48:42.080 --> 3:48:45.680]  it's not like they have all the answers either your phone call what you're seeing in your area
[3:48:45.680 --> 3:48:49.440]  is just as important as what the president knows that's what the president demands the secret service
[3:48:49.440 --> 3:48:54.320]  every note he's given everything people hand that like up to 10 boxes that in fact the left
[3:48:54.320 --> 3:48:59.840]  makes a big joke and white house elitists don't like it trump sits there while he eats on air force
[3:48:59.840 --> 3:49:05.360]  one flight and they'll bring in all these boxes he goes oh and then he just digs through it and
[3:49:05.360 --> 3:49:12.800]  just oh he'll sit there at midnight the switchboard talking to people because he wants the intel on the
[3:49:12.800 --> 3:49:17.040]  street so when i go i want your calls i want your calls i'm not just saying that to make you feel
[3:49:17.040 --> 3:49:21.040]  important i want your calls which we're about to go to if you're holding by the way they don't ask
[3:49:21.040 --> 3:49:26.000]  for but each one of these folks gets a free t-shirt or a bottle of uh x2 or x3 whatever they want
[3:49:26.000 --> 3:49:29.440]  just just get their name and number we're going to go to them too i appreciate them holding for
[3:49:29.440 --> 3:49:33.680]  two hours again the problem is having 20 something phone lines and more calls come in you end up
[3:49:33.680 --> 3:49:37.840]  holding you know one person's been holding an hour 53 minutes that's not right but i got the
[3:49:37.840 --> 3:49:42.720]  30 something calls so just the way it is so you hold is your deal i sell as a texas hospitality
[3:49:42.720 --> 3:49:47.920]  person i would not want to be treated like that so i'm feeling guilty that that's how i operate
[3:49:47.920 --> 3:49:51.280]  like just i'm not doing that to me go well i'm kissing your ass i'm telling you that's how my
[3:49:51.280 --> 3:49:55.120]  psychology works you get why do these things i literally feel like a piece of crap with three
[3:49:55.120 --> 3:50:00.480]  people being on hold for an hour but we'll get to them hopefully um closing comment on this bad
[3:50:00.480 --> 3:50:04.720]  bracket we'll invite you back on tomorrow if you can do it closing comment john rapaport if you want
[3:50:04.720 --> 3:50:08.640]  to come back on bracket or in the war and we've got record listorship right now i'm tempted to come
[3:50:08.640 --> 3:50:12.880]  back you know it's six i'll be here maybe just do all nighters or something because the callers
[3:50:12.880 --> 3:50:18.800]  commercial free need to be heard uh i'm just i get it racking you're you're a navy seal your
[3:50:18.800 --> 3:50:24.480]  cop type guy you go off what you've got and you're like hey you know we'll have panic we'll have
[3:50:24.480 --> 3:50:28.800]  breakdown of civilization if this is bad as they say you're covering what you know is real
[3:50:28.800 --> 3:50:33.200]  and what you can deal with i'm asking you to be theoretical gut level what do you think this thing
[3:50:33.200 --> 3:50:40.160]  is i think that it's legit in terms of a real pandemic um i don't think that it's you know
[3:50:40.160 --> 3:50:45.760]  just a uh faked out thing that like china's like you know china will just volunteer to shoot off
[3:50:45.760 --> 3:50:52.240]  one of its feet with a shotgun for the for the n w o i mean imagine uh 50 million people under
[3:50:52.240 --> 3:50:58.000]  quarantine uh this is a terrible thing but that killed 50 million turtles under Rockefeller orders
[3:50:58.960 --> 3:51:05.520]  but but right but with an economy that's still functioning but to shut shut off like it's like
[3:51:05.520 --> 3:51:10.080]  cut off your hand okay because it's infected cut it off they're not doing this out of uh
[3:51:10.640 --> 3:51:16.240]  you know following orders from some cabal i think that has credence so a little little thing told me
[3:51:16.240 --> 3:51:21.200]  maybe uh people are pissed and it's a bio weapon because of the them hitting us with fentanyl
[3:51:23.200 --> 3:51:31.280]  you know i i don't it what you're saying to me is goes to the point of trust in 1918 when a terrible
[3:51:31.280 --> 3:51:36.480]  pandemic hit people would have believed what they read in the paper or heard from the president
[3:51:36.480 --> 3:51:41.120]  today nobody know you're right the real variable is the time bomb you know you're right bat come
[3:51:41.120 --> 3:51:45.600]  back you're right the time bombs come on my show start of the show tomorrow what will happen
[3:51:45.600 --> 3:51:50.560]  in an outbreak here we won't behave like china our weakness is will go completely insane which is
[3:51:50.560 --> 3:51:56.320]  also our strength well there's a great black pigeon speaks is now going under felix rex video
[3:51:56.320 --> 3:52:01.520]  a couple days ago about how it can end civilization it's not the plague that will kill us the plague
[3:52:01.520 --> 3:52:07.120]  is just the trigger it's the breakdown in food supply if people just say i'm not going to work
[3:52:07.120 --> 3:52:11.680]  because you know 10 percent of the people are sick with this thing then nobody drives the trucks the
[3:52:11.680 --> 3:52:18.560]  food doesn't get delivered three days a week in our cities with no food and they blow up i can you
[3:52:18.560 --> 3:52:24.480]  join me at 11 0 5 tomorrow then to do a couple segments on the dark side of the dark side the
[3:52:24.480 --> 3:52:29.920]  dark side of the rainbow how bad this could get just with a societal breakdown can you do that
[3:52:29.920 --> 3:52:34.960]  tomorrow sure but all right matt bracket will start the show because i get what he's saying
[3:52:34.960 --> 3:52:39.520]  thank you matt i gotta jam in three calls i swear to do it ravaport's coming up in an hour an hour
[3:52:39.520 --> 3:52:45.520]  into the war room ravaport real fast how about the dark side of the dark side as i keep saying
[3:52:45.520 --> 3:52:51.040]  what could this do to the economy obviously a weapon obviously pointed i think really not in
[3:52:51.040 --> 3:52:57.040]  america but the whole world in general yeah on this point i would say that and i agree
[3:52:58.080 --> 3:53:04.640]  you know you can do this a number of different ways emergency state of emergency stay in your
[3:53:04.640 --> 3:53:10.080]  houses people stay home from work for whatever reason you don't have trucks on the road you
[3:53:10.080 --> 3:53:16.480]  don't have food deliveries this and that you can engineer states of emergency in all manner of ways
[3:53:16.480 --> 3:53:23.680]  that break down the ordinary details of everyday life so that people are under the gun you bet
[3:53:24.240 --> 3:53:30.240]  absolutely and this has been done but the united states will drop atomic weapons on you
[3:53:30.800 --> 3:53:36.320]  and so the i mean my point is could this be a bio weapon that's very specific as a message
[3:53:36.320 --> 3:53:40.720]  of china i mean they've been i'm not endorsing that but i'm just saying the united states
[3:53:40.720 --> 3:53:48.080]  will will will do things nobody else has done sure but i don't think it's a bio weapon but
[3:53:48.080 --> 3:53:52.720]  you know that's a whole other discussion that's a whole other talk about what are you going to
[3:53:52.720 --> 3:54:00.640]  cover when you take over in one hour i'm going to cover the history of other epidemics so called
[3:54:00.640 --> 3:54:07.760]  epidemics that were not true and what the clandestine operations were all about and how they clamped
[3:54:07.760 --> 3:54:14.960]  down exactly as they're trying to do now only now is much much much bigger yeah bottom line there's
[3:54:14.960 --> 3:54:20.240]  there's a big move afoot and uh enemies foreign domestic dot com no more fake news dot com be sure
[3:54:20.240 --> 3:54:23.520]  and check both those sites out thank you both gentlemen look forward to speaking to you soon
[3:54:24.560 --> 3:54:28.720]  thank you thanks all right warren's about to begin but i swore to go to your calls and i'm
[3:54:28.720 --> 3:54:33.440]  going to do it i appreciate erin and jeremy and john holding this long so let's go to jeremy
[3:54:33.440 --> 3:54:38.880]  in texas you got one minute go ahead jeremy
[3:54:40.480 --> 3:54:45.440]  brother go ahead hey aux this is a bill deberg measles party there is no pandemic until all
[3:54:45.440 --> 3:54:51.280]  the sheep line up for the vaccine and i say that because chris lydell hr mcmaster and wilbur ross
[3:54:51.280 --> 3:54:56.640]  all met in shantilly virginia for bill deberg in 2017 that's a poll joseph watson article it's
[3:54:56.640 --> 3:55:00.240]  say that bill deberg thinks there's still a chance of pressure on trump for some to back down on his
[3:55:00.240 --> 3:55:05.360]  america first policy and while you have calmer secretary wilbur ross today saying that coronavirus
[3:55:05.360 --> 3:55:09.440]  is a good thing you know the doseki's virus because the general public's out searching for
[3:55:09.440 --> 3:55:14.640]  corona beer virus while this is going on and what is the incident right ross is saying it's good
[3:55:15.520 --> 3:55:21.120]  oh it's a good and loving thing yeah it's a good and loving thing and so what's the incentive
[3:55:21.120 --> 3:55:25.280]  in motive in china they have hong kong going on now there's already been video released
[3:55:25.280 --> 3:55:29.600]  of a gentleman saying screaming saying i'm not sick i'm not sick while they're shoving him in the
[3:55:29.600 --> 3:55:34.160]  back of a vehicle and you know while china is also releasing all this video look at all this new
[3:55:34.160 --> 3:55:39.200]  quarantine technology we've gotten again they're starting the narrative and this is an opportunity
[3:55:39.200 --> 3:55:42.800]  this is the collectivist dream this is not a collectivist nightmare it's a collectivist dream
[3:55:42.800 --> 3:55:47.760]  because but the worldly leader saying hey you want power you're gonna get power now look at this evil
[3:55:47.760 --> 3:55:52.080]  thing we did don't you want the flow of money to hurt all the people while you have hardware
[3:55:52.080 --> 3:55:56.720]  epidemiologists saying this is thermonuclear pandemic again it's not a pandemic until you get
[3:55:56.720 --> 3:56:01.360]  the vaccine this is to imply that there's advanced mutation there hasn't been advanced mutation it's
[3:56:01.360 --> 3:56:05.200]  blowing up in china because it passes through the air and they're all in powers and and it just
