[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000]  It's too...
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the InfoWars and say,
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000]  I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this,
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000]  but you want to fight, you better believe you've got one!
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:45.000]  It's Tuesday, May 23rd, 2023.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, reporting from the road.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000]  I'll be back, co-hosting with Owen, from the road, on Thursday.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000]  But again, today and tomorrow, I'll be filing video and audio reports
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]  on the major developments happening in our world.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000]  Coming up at the start of the next segment, I'm going to lay out
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000]  what's really behind the big freak-out going on with the national debt,
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000]  the debt ceiling, and the bonds.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000]  Will there be a big default?
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000]  This is all part of what the globalists call the managed decline of the West.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]  But really, it's a managed decline of the entire world,
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000]  the destruction of the Western renaissance, our social contract,
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.000]  of upper mobility and a neglectorian system that believes in empowering humanity.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000]  This is a totalitarian, transhumanist death cult.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000]  And the reason humanity is in so much trouble is because
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]  we will not admit to ourselves that true evil exists,
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000]  and when methodologies of total evil and corruption are being carried out against us,
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000]  we will not come to grips with the fact that we are truly facing
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]  absolute, pure, total corruption,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000]  and a scientifically deployed system that is designed
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]  to bring in the end of humanity as we know it.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]  That is what we're facing.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000]  And any rational person that even scientifically studies what's happening
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]  comes to that conclusion.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]  Then you study the Bible and history and our enemies,
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:26.000]  and they are a consortium of people following what can only be called satanic principles.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]  So Owen is about to host the rest of the segment.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]  I'll be back to give you my breakdown on the other side.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]  Please stay with us, because remember, folks,
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000]  if you're watching or listening to this broadcast, you are the resistance.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.000]  We are now live in the Infowars World Headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000]  And we are just loaded with news today.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000]  False flags abound,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000]  and it's hard to separate what is real and what is fake.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]  But, you know, as just kind of a starter for today,
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]  yesterday there was something fake,
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]  and, you know, over the years,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000]  you learn how to differentiate what's fake and what's real.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]  It is perhaps harder now than ever,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]  just because there is so much fake stuff out there.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]  But it's like, there's real videos out there,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000]  for example, of on September 11th, 2001,
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000]  and there's real videos out there of the Pentagon,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000]  and you can clearly tell there was no plane that went into the Pentagon.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]  There's no plane damage. There's no plane parts.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000]  Those are real, but that somehow doesn't have an impact.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]  That somehow doesn't make a mark.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]  But yesterday, there was a fake image.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]  It was an AI-generated image of an explosion at the Pentagon.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000]  And I saw it, and I looked it up, and there was no report, so I knew it was fake.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]  But it went viral on the Internet.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]  People kept sharing it on Twitter.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]  And now the headline today,
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]  Stock Market Takes a Brief Tumble After Fake AI-Generated Photo
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000]  on Fake Bloomberg Twitter Account
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]  Shows Explosion at Pentagon This Morning.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]  Now, that was yesterday.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]  But see, there's a lesson in this.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]  Oh, okay, this isn't just about a fake AI image
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]  that people thought was real and got tricked
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]  and then maybe affected the stock market.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]  No, think about it like this.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000]  Think about this as like a key,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]  a map key into how the propaganda works,
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]  how the globalist propaganda works.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000]  They run fake stuff all the time
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000]  that then has a real-world impact.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]  So this is just probably some person
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000]  that makes the fake AI Pentagon thing, it goes viral, has a little impact.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]  No, the globalists do this stuff intentionally,
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]  and it makes permanent impact.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]  is laying right there in front of you, hidden in plain view.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]  where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]  in the world is iodine deficiency.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000]  is lack of real, pure iodine in the body
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000]  as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine, and so much more.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet medical journal study
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000]  in 2007 worldwide have cognitive disabilities
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]  because they don't have high-quality iodine.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000]  Most iodine is bound to other elements, you don't absorb it.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]  We have X3, all three types of good iodine together,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]  that supercharges your body.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000]  X3 is now back in stock at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000]  It's been sold out for over six months for 25% off.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]  X3, back in stock. Take action now. InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000]  It's Tuesday, May 23rd, 2023.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, reporter for The Road.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000]  Owen Schroer with a raft of very informative guest information.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000]  It's going to be taking over here in just a few minutes.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000]  Now, later in the hour, I'm going to air a speech
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000]  that was just given at the European Union Parliament
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000]  dealing with the fact that leftist, woke, transgenderism culture
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000]  is part of a globalist, communist takeover of the means of production
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]  right down to the human beings themselves.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000]  This is an absolutely key speech that is 100% dead on.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]  That is coming up.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]  Also, the former deputy national security advisor
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]  really did a great job over the weekend on Fox News,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]  the videos on InfoWars.com,
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]  laying out exactly what all these new documents
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]  and the Durham report confirms.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]  That we've had a coup in America
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000]  and the deep state is planning to steal the next election.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]  They've even said they are.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]  So we're in a coup, but America's waking up to the fact
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]  that we're under a coup.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]  That's coming up.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]  But first off, everybody's asking,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]  will the U.S. default on the national debt?
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]  Will the bond market crash?
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]  Will Moody's downgrade the United States?
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]  Will we officially become Mexico or Venezuela or worse?
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000]  And the answer is no.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000]  That's not going to happen next week.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000]  I do not believe they're going to default the national debt.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000]  They're going to jack it back up.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]  The Democrats are asking for a huge number.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]  The Republicans are asking for another giant number,
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]  but not as big.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]  But make no mistake, both parties have gone along
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]  with increasing the national debt massively.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000]  In fact, Trump, one of the things he did that was wrong
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]  was basically go along with this.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000]  But in the last two and a half years of Biden,
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000]  they have printed more than half the money ever printed
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]  or ever issued in the history of the United States.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]  So it accelerated, obviously, the last 30 years,
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000]  got incredibly bad under Obama,
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000]  got bad under Trump, continued the acceleration,
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]  and it's just gone off the deep end since then.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]  And all around the world, coordinated central banks
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]  are all devaluing their currencies.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000]  And in the short term, using it to buy up all the infrastructure,
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000]  all the intellectual property, the media,
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000]  and basically give unlimited funding to their woke cult.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000]  But I do not believe that they will default now.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]  They are just training us and getting us ready
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000]  for this into the future, but they're not quite ready
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000]  to roll out their central bank digital currencies.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]  They're still testing them in China.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]  They're still testing them in places like Italy.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]  They're starting to roll them out.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]  It's all part of the universal basic income,
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]  social credit score control grid.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]  But, yes, we're very, very close.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]  If you go to basically most restaurants, most shops,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]  particularly in large cities or even mid-sized towns,
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000]  they'll tell you, sorry, credit card only,
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000]  and all the regular checkout lanes will be shut down
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]  that are human checkout lanes, and it's all self-serve.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000]  And they'll have signs up saying, hey, sorry, you can't use cash.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]  I was in two different drugstores yesterday
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]  because I was trying to use cash.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]  It's a means of fighting the globalists,
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]  just at the micro level, and both of them,
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000]  both a Vons and a CVS, would not take cash.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000]  And I had to call a manager over, make them open up a lane,
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]  and make them take the cash, and he said in the future
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000]  they will not be doing that, so I better get used to it.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000]  So this is all about control.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000]  Everybody knows it.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]  It's completely and totally predatory.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000]  This is the designed, managed decline of civilization.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000]  And I know as listeners you know that,
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000]  but the general public still doesn't understand
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]  that the globalists believe a major crash and major war is coming.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]  Showing their methodology, they want to trigger smaller wars
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000]  and controlled crashes, that's their argument for tyranny,
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000]  so that they control the booms and busts,
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000]  and of course consolidate power and make themselves fabulously rich.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000]  But in the final equation, it's about cutting off resources for humans
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000]  to starve us to death.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]  All over the western world, they're shutting down
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000]  10, 20, 30 percent of the farms each year.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]  Within five or six years, there'll basically be no farms.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000]  But don't worry, they've got the bug factories,
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000]  the big bug warehouses where they raise the bug protein, coming online.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]  So it won't matter if you want beef,
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]  it won't matter if you refuse the bugs,
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]  in their system you'll have to eat the bugs,
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]  because that's all that's going to be available.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000]  Total dystopia.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]  And remember, that's what the lockdowns were about.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000]  Getting you used to dystopia,
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000]  getting you used to not being able to leave your house,
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000]  getting you used to doing things that are classical tyranny.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000]  That's why they're building all the emergency COVID camps around the world.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000]  They're expanding them as we speak,
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]  getting ready for the next disease they're going to release,
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]  and the UN's been openly bragging about that.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]  So there's many angles to this,
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000]  but it's all part of the larger shutting down of industrial society
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]  to carry out depopulation.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000]  The globalists will be exempt,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000]  we the people will be total slaves.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000]  Look at Ireland.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000]  They've now introduced legislation to outright ban all private air travel,
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000]  saying it's bad for the earth.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]  And that only commercial planes will be able to operate,
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000]  we'll pay a large carbon tax.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]  They're taking everything away.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]  And until people realize it's being done by increments,
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000]  we cannot stop it.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]  But once people realize it's being done by successive approximation,
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000]  we can become aware of it,
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]  and struggle to fight the thousands of different ways they're attacking us,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]  but each one of those little attacks combines into a larger attack.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000]  Only full awareness of this can set us free.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]  More special reports I'll introduce coming up,
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]  but first, Owen Schroer is here with the latest breaking news.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000]  Now, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000]  let me tell you what we have in the news.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000]  How do you, I mean, this is so out of control.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000]  Like I said at the opening,
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]  bags abound.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000]  And I mean, the stuff we see is so ludicrous now
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000]  that nobody is really buying it at all.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.000]  But who's ever running these operations is obviously still in operational mode.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]  I mean, even with this patriot front group
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000]  that seems to have no clear identity or leader,
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000]  and they show up and it's a bunch of fit dudes
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000]  in khaki matching outfits with their face masks
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]  covering their faces.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000]  And it's like, well, what part of the movement is this?
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000]  Where do these guys come from?
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]  But see, it's the same propaganda.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000]  These are white supremacists.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000]  These are Trump supporters.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000]  These are Republicans.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]  These are conservatives.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]  These are your enemies.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000]  And then you've got all these instances now
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000]  where they try to tie it to Nazism,
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000]  which, again, gets down to this problem we have now in our society
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000]  that words have no meaning.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000]  When they call somebody a Nazi, as they're saying,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000]  this individual that crashed a U-Haul
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]  was a white supremacist neo-Nazi.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000]  Oh, yeah, people love renting U-Hauls from Missouri
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000]  and then crashing them in D.C.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]  and then leaving a Nazi flag on the ground outside.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000]  That's what they do.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000]  That makes sense.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000]  But, again, it's the same propaganda.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000]  They want you to think that these Nazis are everywhere
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000]  and that's your average Trump voter, Republican voter,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]  which is obviously just absurd.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000]  That's propaganda.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000]  But words have no meaning anymore.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000]  What do they mean when they say Nazi?
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000]  Do they mean that it's a German soldier
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000]  with loyalties to Adolf Hitler and the motherland?
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000]  Is he fighting for the motherland, the Deutschland?
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000]  No.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000]  No, his name was Sai Varshith Kandula
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]  from Chesterfield, Missouri,
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000]  where there actually is a large Indian American population.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000]  They do well out there.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000]  They make good money.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000]  Oh, that's a Nazi.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000]  Oh, maybe he's a national socialist then
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000]  because I don't think 19-year-old Sai Varshith Kandula
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000]  is working in Hitler's army.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000]  We can all agree on that, right?
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000]  I mean, he's not actually in the SS.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000]  He's not actually a Nazi.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000]  So is he a national socialist then?
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.000]  You call him a Nazi.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000]  So then, I mean, he's not from Germany.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000]  He's not wearing a Hugo Boss SS uniform.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000]  He's not heiling Hitler with Adolf Hitler giving a speech.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000]  So what do you mean when you call him a Nazi?
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]  So is he a national socialist?
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000]  Oh, so he's a socialist.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000]  So he's a leftist.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000]  Oh, okay.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]  Is that what you're saying?
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000]  No.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000]  Words have no meaning anymore.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000]  And so now they've taken this word Nazi
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000]  and all it really means now,
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000]  well, it really doesn't mean anything.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000]  It's a projection.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000]  It's a projection.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]  You know a Nazi is bad.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000]  So it's a projection onto their political opposition,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000]  which at this point is anything to the right
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000]  of trans kids surgeries, abortions for all,
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000]  and you name the rest.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]  So I didn't even get into the rest of the news,
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000]  but this is a big story today too.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]  It will change your life.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000]  The UN admits and the Lansink Medical Journal admits
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000]  that upwards of 2 billion people have mental disabilities
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]  and declining cognitive abilities.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000]  The term they use is intellectual disability
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000]  because of lack of iodine.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000]  so your body can't absorb it.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000]  And Infowarsstore.com has the only iodine out there
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000]  that actually has this type of full effect.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for six months.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000]  It's very hard to produce, and it's finally back in stock.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]  You and your family need it.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]  It's 25% off back in stock.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000]  X3, triiodine, exclusively at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000]  Take action now, but regardless, research is info.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]  that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000]  and take him off the air.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000]  It's the same thing with Infowars.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000]  But Infowars is not owned by Fox or controlled by George Soros
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]  or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000]  Please don't take Infowars for granted.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000]  We're barely hanging on.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support,
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000]  while getting great products at the same time at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000]  So don't procrastinate.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]  Get amazing products that keep us on the air
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000]  and never submit to these tyrants.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:07.000]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000]  to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid,
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000]  still highly toxic but containable.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]  and there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the secretary of the treasury,
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000]  who was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:41.000]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000]  and a remedy to this madness.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000]  Available now at Infowarsstore.com
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000]  A flying disk has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000]  Here is a bulletin from CBS News.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000]  This is a different kind of war.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000]  It was almost as if it were a plan in motion.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000]  It just can't happen.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000]  We need to go into the capital.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000]  Stop! Stop! Stop!
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000]  They are nothing but distractions.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]  You silenced those voices.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000]  Soon as we start exposing the Great Reset,
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000]  the sooner these globalists start going to prison.
[00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:37.100]  Alright, let me do a proper layout of the news waterfront today and what is going to
[00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:44.260]  be coming up on the Alex Jones show, including Alex Jones himself.
[00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:53.380]  He's going to respond to what a former security advisor said about how bad the corruption
[00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:59.740]  truly was with the Durham report and how bad it truly is under Biden.
[00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:09.020]  And really I think the story that's being missed here is that I don't know if Obama
[00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:20.040]  is the origin, I don't know if Obama is the alpha, but Obama was certainly the nucleus
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:27.980]  of the entire, what ended up being the entire Russian hoax, Russian collusion narrative
[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:36.060]  that then led to the political persecution, the spying, crossfire, hurricane and everything
[00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:37.260]  else.
[00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:40.740]  So yeah, Hillary Clinton and her people running the opposition research and Hillary Clinton
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:49.780]  her people running the attacks on Donald Trump, Obama turned it into a government, federal
[00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:53.740]  government bureaucracy operation against Donald Trump against the will of the people.
[00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:56.300]  It was Obama.
[00:21:56.300 --> 00:22:01.980]  And so that's kind of missing from this, from this thread and this understanding now.
[00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:06.180]  So Alex is going to be commenting on that coming up in the first hour.
[00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:13.820]  Then in the second hour, the speech that Alex is talking about where a gentleman shows
[00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:19.660]  how the modern day trans movement is Maoism.
[00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:23.340]  Alex is going to be introducing that and playing that in the second hour as well.
[00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:28.180]  Now again, I got into this in the first segment.
[00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:31.180]  I'm not going to spend too much time because I want to cover it and then tell you what
[00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:34.620]  else is coming up too in the news.
[00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:40.020]  Nineteen year old Missouri man arrested in U-Haul crash at White House security barriers
[00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:43.260]  and the optics of this are so absurd.
[00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:50.540]  The gentleman's name is Sai Varshith Kandula and yes, I mean, he appears to be an Indian
[00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:54.940]  American just like his name would suggest.
[00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:59.860]  And so he's now the latest Nazi white supremacist that the left wants you to think are running
[00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:00.860]  around everywhere.
[00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:05.960]  But, but here's what we need to understand when, when the media and the left say Nazi,
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:08.620]  they don't mean Nazi.
[00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:13.780]  When the media and the left say white supremacist, they don't mean white supremacist.
[00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:15.820]  They mean conservative.
[00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:17.460]  They mean Republican.
[00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:20.000]  They mean Trump supporter.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.240]  But for them to come out and say, look at this Trump supporter that crashed a U-Haul
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:27.520]  with a Nazi flag, that's just a little too obtuse.
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:29.760]  That's just a little too obvious.
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:37.120]  So they play this little nuanced game of connections and they hit you with the propaganda.
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.120]  Trump supporters are Nazis.
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.120]  Trump supporters are Nazis.
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:40.120]  Trump supporters are Nazis.
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:41.120]  Trump supporters are Nazis.
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.120]  Trump supporters are Nazis.
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.760]  And they just boom, boom, boom, just hit you with it.
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:48.120]  And then, oh my gosh, here's this 19 year old crashes a U-Haul truck.
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:49.120]  Oh my gosh.
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:50.240]  Oh my gosh.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.240]  Oh, there's a Nazi flag out on the streets.
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:53.800]  Oh, see Nazis are everywhere.
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:57.160]  And then they're just expecting in your head, you're making that connection.
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:58.160]  Oh, it's a Nazi.
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.200]  Oh, it's a Trump supporter.
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:04.160]  So they don't have to say the ludicrous, which is look at this 19 year old Trump supporter,
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.720]  because nobody would believe that.
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:11.200]  But of course, nobody believes that that's a Nazi either.
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.200]  It's all propaganda.
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.320]  Now, what's the real story?
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:18.840]  Who really knows at this point, I don't even think it matters quite frankly, because at
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:20.480]  the end of the day, it's the same story.
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:22.940]  The media is lying to you.
[00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:26.080]  The left wing is lying to you.
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:32.920]  They're putting out these red herrings, these straw men, so that they can point at and scream
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:34.560]  and say, that's your enemy.
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.160]  It doesn't even really exist.
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:39.560]  And so then they go up there and they punch a straw man and they say, see how strong I
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:40.560]  am.
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:41.840]  I'm defending you.
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:44.720]  So that's going on.
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.480]  There's some big economic news today.
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:53.800]  And it's just, there's things that you're experiencing in life now.
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:57.360]  And it's also all over the news.
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:02.920]  And I was just looking at the housing market here in Austin.
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:03.920]  And I'm a homeowner.
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:08.240]  And I'm looking at it, I'm thinking just holy smokes.
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:12.760]  The housing market in Austin has truly crashed.
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.160]  It has truly crashed.
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:23.320]  I mean, there's still some areas where you might do okay, but it's not looking so good.
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:32.240]  Because if you bought a house, nobody's buying houses really since Biden took over.
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:39.480]  And that's just a sign of the economic times and the difference between when Trump was
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.240]  president and when Biden is president.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:49.639]  And so I saw it in the news today, US housing market sees biggest one year drop in a decade.
[00:25:49.639 --> 00:25:51.720]  In a decade.
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:55.040]  Now this can be recovered.
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:26:00.800]  But that's big news that needs to get a lot more attention.
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:07.720]  And now also the mortgage rates are going up as well.
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:09.639]  That's just some of the economic news.
[00:26:09.639 --> 00:26:12.600]  Your layoffs going on still.
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.200]  Democrats increasing your taxes.
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.880]  That doesn't help anything.
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:18.840]  So we got that coming up.
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:28.040]  There was a story, I didn't get to it yesterday, but there's some other stories in the news today that I think it applies to, so maybe it was better off.
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:33.040]  Poll shows how radically different Americans' opinions are from liberal corporate media narratives.
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:47.040]  And so basically, the phenomenon here is, if you watch the media and you believe the media, then your view of what Americans really think and feel is wrong.
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:27:03.040]  But the problem is, if you don't understand that paradigm, you fall into the trap that thinking the things the left is promoting are popular, like trans kids or the war in Ukraine or all this other garbage.
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:07.040]  It's not popular. It never was popular.
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:16.040]  It was media propaganda hyping it up, amplifying it so that you think it's popular, even though it's not.
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:21.040]  Poll shows how radically different Americans' opinions are from liberal corporate media narratives.
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:26.040]  So I got all kinds of examples of that in the news today as well.
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:31.040]  The next pandemic will be even deadlier than COVID, says the World Health Organization.
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:34.040]  Why hasn't anybody just shut them down already?
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:37.040]  So we got some other news on the health stuff.
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:44.040]  Some big news when it comes to election and the voting process we're going to be covering.
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:48.040]  And, man, look, I'm just as sick.
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:51.040]  Oh, my gosh. And it's not even Pride Month yet.
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:57.040]  I'm just as sick of the LGBTQ plus pedophile thing that I just.
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:04.040]  After covering it yesterday for probably like an hour, I'm thinking to myself last night, I can't cover it again today.
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:06.040]  And then it's just all over the news.
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:08.040]  I mean, it's just everywhere.
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:15.040]  And it's not even Pride Month yet, and you're just drowning in the LGBTQ plus pedophile propaganda.
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:17.040]  I mean, it's just insane.
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.040]  And it's not even Pride Month yet.
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:22.040]  So it's just they're just there are this June.
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:29.040]  This Pride Month, folks, is going to be so absurd because they know their time is short now.
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:34.040]  They know their sexual propaganda, perversions and grooming of children.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:36.040]  They know that the clock is running out.
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:38.040]  So they're just going hog wild, man.
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:42.040]  I mean, they are just going hog wild with it.
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:51.040]  So we got that in the news today as well, including some other important video clips on this Tuesday, May 23rd.
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:54.040]  Twenty twenty three edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:56.040]  Owen Shroyer filling in today.
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:02.040]  Sold out for more than a year.

[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:02.040]  Turbo Force is back.
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:04.040]  Sold out for eight months.
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:06.040]  And it's Turbo Force Plus.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:08.040]  We made it even stronger.
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:12.040]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:19.040]  Turbo Force is back in stock at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:25.040]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time release over 10 hours.
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:27.040]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:37.040]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids that turbo charge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:41.040]  It is the super fuel.
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:43.040]  Rain Force Plus is great.
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.040]  Rain Force Ultra is great.
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:45.040]  They're two different nootropics.
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.040]  They go good with this.
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:48.040]  But this is the King Kong.
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:50.040]  This is the boss.
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:55.040]  Turbo Force, back in stock, discounted, Infowarsstore.com.
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:58.040]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:07.040]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:16.040]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:19.040]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:22.040]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:31.040]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:41.040]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day, derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:47.040]  Our Infowars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:53.040]  Pure, nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:33:00.040]  For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism, get yours now at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:07.040]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:36.730]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones. And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:33:38.730 --> 00:34:01.730]  So yesterday, there was a fake image, an AI-generated image of an explosion at the Pentagon that ended up getting shared a lot on Twitter and then had stories written about it on the Internet, and it was fake.
[00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:17.730]  And it actually had an impact on the stock market that day. It really did recover, but in that hour or two when that was going viral, it did impact the stock market.
[00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:30.730]  And so why am I talking about this? Because you have to understand that while that might have been some isolated individual that pulled off a prank, the impact was real.
[00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:50.730]  And we have a government, the U.S. government, federal government, that runs real PSYOPs and real false flags to make real-world impact seemingly every day now.
[00:34:50.730 --> 00:35:14.730]  And so if you understand the dynamic of a fake image that leads to a stock market crash, then you understand why the media today is telling you that a neo-Nazi white supremacist named Sai Varshith Kandula crashed a U-Haul into a structure in Washington, D.C.
[00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:34.730]  Same reason why they tell you January 6th was an insurrection. Same reason why they tell you Donald Trump is a racist. Same reason why the media lies to you every day. They do it to have a real-world impact.
[00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:50.730]  So again, an individual making a fake AI photo of the Pentagon with an explosion outside, for whatever intended purposes, that looks like it's probably an isolated incident, an isolated individual.
[00:35:50.730 --> 00:36:02.730]  The U.S. government does this intentionally. The U.S. media does this intentionally to you, directed at you every day to have a real-world impact that is permanent.
[00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:16.730]  Because nobody ends up coming out and saying, oh, that's not true. Donald Trump's not a racist. No, they double down, triple down. They tell you it for five years, ten years.
[00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:34.730]  Nobody's going to come out and correct the record and say, hey, conservatives and Christians and Trump voters and Republicans, they're not Nazis, they're not white supremacists. That was fake. That was fake. Nope, nobody's correcting that.
[00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:50.730]  So that's the real-world AI Pentagon explosion video, except that's real-world federal government liberal propaganda intended to make a real-world political impact and a permanent one at that.
[00:36:50.730 --> 00:37:04.730]  Take the Russian collusion hoax. Again, totally fake. Trump never colluded with Russia. Had a real-world impact. But are we understanding that now? Do we have a general understanding?
[00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:26.730]  Everybody knows today that that image of the explosion at the Pentagon is fake. There is no doubt. That's settled. Fake image. Was no explosion. Well, Donald Trump never colluded with Russia. That's as fake as that AI photo of an explosion outside the Pentagon.
[00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:46.730]  But is that the universal understanding today? Is that the general consensus for every American today? No. Because the people that ran the fake Russian collusion hoax did it with intention to be a permanent impact.
[00:37:46.730 --> 00:38:10.730]  Not like some individual that puts a fake explosion at the Pentagon, probably as a prank, that ends up having a momentary real-world impact. Now we know it's fake. The fake Russian collusion hoax is still impacting our country and we all can't come to the conclusion that it was fake. It was fake.
[00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:30.730]  Trump-Russia collusion is as real as the AI-generated photograph of an explosion outside the Pentagon. The difference being we all know that that was a fake photo. Some people still believe in the big lie of Trump-Russia collusion. And so there are, I mean, examples of this everywhere.
[00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:46.730]  Now today it's the white supremacist thing. You know, it's just an amazing thing, isn't it? Again, words have no meaning. Nazi doesn't mean Nazi. White supremacist doesn't mean white supremacist. They both mean the same thing now.
[00:38:46.730 --> 00:39:06.730]  It's a code word for conservatives, Christians, white men, Trump voters, Republicans. But they know you're not going to believe all these lies just straight up at face value if they say it's about your Republican neighbor or your Christian family members or your friend that's a Trump voter.
[00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:26.730]  But see, they make the connection and they say Trump supporters racist, Trump supporters Nazis. And then they run their hoaxes and they say, look, there's a Nazi. And they just want that with the psychological operations against you for your brain to make that connection, even if it's subconsciously just say, oh, look, there's a Nazi.
[00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:45.730]  Oh, I was told Nazis are Trump supporters. So Trump supporters are Nazis. And wow, that must be a Trump supporter, even though it's all fake. And so they're doing it again. But let's look back. This was last week. This was last week on the Atlantic.com website.
[00:39:45.730 --> 00:40:00.730]  Latinos can be white supremacists. Latinos can be white supremacists. These words no longer have meaning, folks.
[00:40:00.730 --> 00:40:16.730]  What is a white supremacist?
[00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:37.730]  If I go talk to, in this case, they're talking about the shooter from a couple of weeks ago in Dallas that some people think might have just been a fan of manga, I think is what it's called. It's like anime, comic books and stuff that feature Nazi stuff in it all the time. It's like part of that culture.
[00:40:38.730 --> 00:41:04.730]  It's a totally different world. And they have Nazi symbolism and Nazi all over this stuff. And some people think he was just a big comic book guy. And maybe that's why he liked it, because he was into manga. I'm not a big expert on that stuff. But really, do you think that individual, if you walked up to him and you said, hey, you're a white supremacist, aren't you? What do you think he would say? Do you think he would say, yep, I think white people are the best thing on the planet and everything else is inferior?
[00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:19.730]  No, that's ludicrous. He's not a white supremacist. Liberals are liars. It's the fake AI generated image of an explosion outside the Pentagon. It's not real. Words have no meaning.
[00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:48.730]  This individual, Sai Varshith Kandula, is not a Nazi. He doesn't wear a Hugo Boss Hitler SS uniform. He doesn't speak German. He's probably never been to Germany. He doesn't love the motherland. He's not a Nazi. The Nazis have been defeated. Where are the Nazis? Where is Hitler's army?
[00:41:50.730 --> 00:42:09.730]  So he's not a Nazi from the 1940s. So is he a national socialist? Is that what you're saying? Certainly you wouldn't be saying that, because then you'd say he's a leftist. He's a socialist. That's the AOC wing. That's the Democrats. So they can't actually mean that he's a socialist, right?
[00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:25.730]  So what do they actually mean? Their nuanced language is he's a Trump supporter. He's a conservative. He's a Christian. He's a Republican.
[00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:46.730]  It's all propaganda. It's the fake AI image of an explosion outside the Pentagon. It's a Nazi flag outside of a U-Haul truck driven by Sai Varshith Kandula to make people believe still that white supremacist Nazis are lurking around every corner. But what you really need to know is they're all Trump voters and they're all conservatives.
[00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:57.730]  There is no difference between the fake AI image of the explosion at the Pentagon and leftists telling you neo-Nazis are running around.
[00:43:17.730 --> 00:43:37.730]  intellectual disability because of lack of iodine. Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it. Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells. And Infowarsstore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect.
[00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:59.730]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3 has been sold out for six months. It's very hard to produce and it's finally back in stock. In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad. This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful. You and your family need it. It's 25% off, back in stock. X3. Try iodine exclusively at Infowarsstore.com. Take action now. But regardless, research is info.
[00:44:00.730 --> 00:44:21.730]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mugshot because they knew that that would help Trump. Didn't they know this would backfire? We were waiting for the mugshot. We learned today they wouldn't have it so we've made our own. And it says political prisoner with an image of President Trump. The shirt is being printed now in Texas. It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:40.730]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mugshot jail background. It's a fundraiser shirt. It says Infowars.com on the back of the shirt. We also have Alex Jones for president. No, I'm not running for president. It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt. Red, white and blue. Alex Jones for president.
[00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:58.730]  2024. It's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt. Great way to fund the operation. So get your Alex Jones for president and Trump mugshot shirts at Infowarsstore.com or by calling toll free triple eight two five three three one three nine.
[00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:21.730]  I want to say brain force is great. I want to say turbo force is amazing. It is. But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it? The fish oil is better than it. And that's an example of what I'm talking about. Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:37.730]  Krill oils is the best. And it'll give you the damn burps. And I'm sorry. You want something like this? You don't get stuff for free. The krill is hallucinogenic. It's so good in my view. I'm not a medical statement here, but let me tell you something. I eat five tablets of krill oil before I go to bed. I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:53.730]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is. So we don't make a big profit off of it. But, you know, as I just obsess, because whatever the best is, we've got. I just can't lie to you. I just can't do it.
[00:45:54.730 --> 00:46:15.730]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air. People said, no way is the most pop would ever happen. They've got quadrillions of stolen money. They only had their curls on the air because they believe they control him. But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:38.730]  It's the same thing with them for worse. But info wars is not owned by Fox or controlled by George Soros or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan. We are only beholden to our viewers, our listeners. And when you support us, we're unstoppable. I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros. I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:58.730]  So I want to thank you for your support. Encourage your listeners. Understand, please don't take info wars for granted. We're barely hanging on. We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support. We'll get a great products at the same time. And then for sure, I come. So don't procrastinate. Go to him for sure. I come get amazing products that keep us on the air and never submit to these tyrants.
[00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:06.730]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:09.730]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:24.960]  And welcome back to this live Tuesday edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:29.320]  I want to play a very important clip of KT McFarland, a former deputy national security
[00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:34.560]  advisor who was on Fox News laying out the truth, saying the FBI, the Justice Department,
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:40.560]  the CIA will rig the 2024 U.S. presidential election following their success in rigging
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:45.600]  the 2016-2020 election, because they won't allow any candidate to win that would hold
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:46.800]  them accountable.
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:51.640]  There's also an interview with a congressman on Infowars.com right now, and I'll get to
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:56.000]  that later, where the congressman says on national TV, look, the Justice Department doesn't
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.240]  respect us.
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:59.200]  They don't care how many crimes they commit.
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:00.520]  We've had a coup.
[00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:04.880]  We are ruled by the Justice Department in an alliance with the Democratic Party and
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:07.360]  the big corporations that finance them.
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:08.360]  And that's just the truth.
[00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:13.480]  Now, I've been saying that for decades, but now it's out in the open.
[00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:14.480]  And that's the good news.
[00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:19.300]  It's going to be very hard for these criminals to govern us and rule over us when they're
[00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:25.640]  financing the drugs, the open borders, the child kidnapping, the pedophilia, all the corruption
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:30.600]  is coming from the top, and the Justice Department is there at the top to protect it.
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:31.600]  And they think they're going to get away with this?
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:32.600]  They're not.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:36.360]  Again, there are so many high-level federal judges and high-level border patrol and high-level
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:41.480]  agency people that hate this and know it's wrong and know it's pure evil.
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:43.760]  And they're speaking out, and there's whistleblowers.
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:47.960]  So that's why I keep saying the government is not our enemy.
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:52.680]  It's fashionable to say, oh, let's arrest all the FBI and put them all in jail, or let's
[00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:53.680]  abolish the FBI.
[00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:55.520]  And that will probably need to be done.
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:49:03.600]  But the key here is, is that we have to prosecute the globalist crime cabal that's at the top.
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:08.920]  And you're talking about a couple hundred people in the federal government, a couple
[00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:14.240]  thousand managers globally, because it's the same system worldwide, but they've taken over.
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:18.440]  We're talking about maybe 3,000 managers and a couple hundred controllers.
[00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:21.640]  And by the way, I don't just say this.
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:26.160]  Henry Kissinger co-wrote a book, or contributed to a book, with the head of the Kissinger
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:31.800]  group, Rothkopf, now about 15 years ago, called Superclass, and I've read other books they've
[00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:32.800]  written as well.
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:38.480]  And they say it's about 3,000 people worldwide that are the main manager class that run
[00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:39.480]  it all.
[00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:40.480]  And so it's those guys.
[00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:41.960]  I mean, they're the globalists.
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:49.840]  So look, if somebody took over your house, you just have the police come remove them.
[00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:53.520]  You don't burn down your house because somebody moved into it and is squatting in it.
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:54.840]  That's the same thing.
[00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:55.840]  This is our country.
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:56.840]  These are our agencies.
[00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:57.840]  These are our universities.
[00:49:57.840 --> 00:49:59.680]  These are our systems.
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:04.360]  All we've got to do is recognize the new world order, remove the corrupt cabals from the
[00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:07.480]  top, and not have a civil war.
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:09.680]  So a lot of people are like, Alex is being a wimp.
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:11.560]  He's kissing the system's ass.
[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:14.300]  You didn't want to burn it all down.
[00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:17.440]  It's the left that wants to burn it all down, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:20.480]  They're the ones that want to destroy the infrastructure while they use it to gain power
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:21.480]  and control.
[00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:25.480]  That's the, you'll own nothing, you'll have nothing, you'll be happy.
[00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:31.640]  That's this socialist singularity that Karl Marx talked about that the big banks are financing.
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:33.400]  It's a system of total slavery.
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:36.320]  Well, they're ultra rich, and we're all slaves.
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:37.320]  Communism is the ultimate lie.
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:40.760]  Next hour, we're going to hear a very, very powerful, an excerpt of a very, very powerful
[00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:46.920]  30-minute speech that was given to the EU Parliament recently that we're also posting
[00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:48.280]  to Infowars.com.
[00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:55.080]  But first, let's go to this clip where she says, we now have black and white evidence
[00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:59.800]  that the FBI interfered in the 2016 election when they failed to elect Hillary Clinton.
[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:04.000]  They set out to destroy the Trump administration, and then she goes through what happened over
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.040]  the last seven years, and now what they're about to do again.
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:09.320]  This is really, really important.
[00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:10.320]  Share this clip.
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:15.680]  It's on Infowars.com, and understand, recognizing we live under a coup, recognizing that our
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:21.040]  government's been occupied by globalist operatives, and recognizing that they're not our government,
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:24.360]  that they're illegitimate, is the beginning of the end for these people.
[00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:29.600]  We can fix this peacefully with political and cultural awakening, with boycotts, with
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:35.440]  lawsuits, and with civil disobedience, but violence is their only hope.
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:37.080]  That's why violence is not the answer.
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:38.920]  We've got to decry violence.
[00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:40.880]  That's offensive violence.
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:44.480]  You know what Obi-Wan Kenobi says, and it's certainly true because they wrote the script
[00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:47.320]  based on things in history.
[00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:52.040]  We have to use the force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.
[00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:53.320]  Those that shoot first lose.
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:58.320]  In fact, if they can trick us into a shooting war, even if they start it, it's going to
[00:51:58.320 --> 00:51:59.480]  go from bad to worse.
[00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:03.440]  The globalists are counting on bringing down society while they're funding Antifa, Black
[00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:08.800]  Lives Matter, and the rest of it, so I keep harping on information war and the truth,
[00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:10.600]  and realizing the government's not our enemy.
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:11.600]  It's been hijacked.
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:12.600]  It's too big.
[00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:13.600]  It's got to be reformed.
[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:16.320]  But we do not want to be part of the cloud-dependent collapse strategy.
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:17.560]  Now, here's the key clip.
[00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:23.360]  We now have black and white evidence that the FBI interfered in the 2016 election, and
[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:27.600]  then when they failed to get their candidate elected, Hillary Clinton, then they just set
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:29.880]  out to destroy the Trump administration.
[00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:32.200]  So then go back, go up to 2020.
[00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:37.960]  It was the CIA this time that got involved in the 2020 election with those 51 former
[00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:43.540]  intel agents who talked about the Hunter Biden laptop as total Russian disinformation.
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:45.860]  So they've gotten away with it for two elections.
[00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:49.700]  They're for sure going to get away with it, try to get away with it in 24, right?
[00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:51.220]  Because there's no consequence.
[00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:54.860]  The difference is in 2024, the evidence is there.
[00:52:54.860 --> 00:52:56.260]  We now have the Durham investigation.
[00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:58.180]  We have all the congressional investigations.
[00:52:58.180 --> 00:53:02.660]  There is now hard evidence that there was election interference by the U.S. intelligence
[00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:05.020]  agencies and the Department of Justice.
[00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:09.420]  They've got to be terrified, those individuals have to be terrified, that a Republican president
[00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:15.720]  comes in in the 2024 election with a Republican attorney general, investigates them and charges
[00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:18.900]  them all with the crimes they've committed over the last eight years.
[00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:20.860]  Well, we'll see about that.
[00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:21.860]  You're right.
[00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:25.380]  There are questions around these elections because of this interference.
[00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:29.420]  Do you think there will be election interference then in 24?
[00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:30.420]  Take it to the bank.
[00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:32.420]  They will absolutely interfere in 2024.
[00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:37.340]  We're not sure how, but they will absolutely interfere, not only because they're not going
[00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:40.860]  to like whoever the Republican candidate is, but because they're going to protect their
[00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:41.860]  own hides.
[00:53:41.860 --> 00:53:45.540]  That's why they were talking to their own people, and the whistleblowers have brought
[00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:49.100]  this up, that they were told, don't put anything on paper, just tell us orally.
[00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:51.020]  They knew that they were doing stuff wrong.
[00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:54.020]  They knew that they were going to be liable for prosecution.
[00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:56.340]  Yeah, it's too bad.
[00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:59.980]  I wish the media were more curious about all of this.
[00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:03.940]  Unfortunately, the media takes the narrative of the Democrat party and runs with it and
[00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:06.860]  then tries to cancel anybody who's not on board.
[00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:09.420]  Well, they're in the same position.
[00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:15.180]  They can't possibly admit they were wrong because that sort of cuts under, it just undercuts
[00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:16.820]  their whole reason for being.
[00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:20.140]  So they're going to continue to have the fake narrative and they're going to continue to
[00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:23.300]  cover up and pretend that nothing bad went on.
[00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:24.940]  I mean, they're all in it together.
[00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:26.180]  This is what the terrible thing is.
[00:54:26.180 --> 00:54:28.140]  These people are selling the country.
[00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:32.700]  They're just selling us out, not only to foreign leaders, but they're interfering in our elections.
[00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:34.180]  They're tearing up the constitution.
[00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:35.180]  Why?
[00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:36.220]  Because they want to protect their jobs.
[00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:38.060]  They want to protect their ratings.
[00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:39.500]  It just is.
[00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:44.740]  I never thought I would be this upset about how anybody in the government was performing.
[00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:47.540]  But this is just a gut punch to the American people.
[00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:48.540]  It really is.
[00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:49.820]  And it's because you're a patriot.
[00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:51.420]  You don't want to see this kind of injustice.
[00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:52.420]  I agree with you.
[00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:53.420]  KT, it's good to see you.
[00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:54.420]  Thank you.
[00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:59.060]  So when will justice be served is the ultimate question here.
[00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:01.860]  When will justice be served?
[00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:08.180]  There are innocent men and women sitting in prisons right now because of political persecution
[00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:11.780]  of the Democrat Party, when the real criminals at the top of the Democrat Party, like Barack
[00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:22.220]  Obama and Joe Biden, are yet free, continuing to run their operations against the American
[00:55:22.220 --> 00:55:25.100]  people.
[00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:29.140]  Truly a grave and dangerous injustice.
[00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:35.060]  And the sooner that gets corrected, the sooner we can get this country back on track.
[00:55:35.060 --> 00:55:42.060]  Now we are going to be hearing again from Alex coming up in the next hour, getting into
[00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:49.820]  the speech about how the new trans religion, trans movement, is just like a communist Marxist
[00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:52.860]  Maoism Leninism tactic.
[00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:56.420]  And of course, and that's why they want to remove the Bible and the cross and the national
[00:55:56.420 --> 00:56:00.980]  anthem and the Pledge of Allegiance from the schools, and they want to replace it with
[00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:09.300]  pornography books and pride flags and gay flags and everything else under the sun.
[00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:15.220]  That is unnatural and inappropriate for children.
[00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:24.820]  So don't go anywhere as more breaking news from Alex coming up now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:32.220]  Us being on air is still an important thing because we can move the narrative and we can
[00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:37.220]  push the Overton window with this platform, with this audience, with the impact and the
[00:56:37.220 --> 00:56:38.700]  influence that we have here.
[00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:40.140]  That's all of us together.
[00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:44.060]  And it's your support at Infowarsstore.com that makes that possible.
[00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:48.220]  Folks, if you're not filtering your water, I can't recommend it enough.
[00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:49.220]  We've got great supplements.
[00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:50.220]  I take the supplements.
[00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:51.220]  I love the supplements.
[00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:55.940]  You need nascent iodine, survival shield X3, 25% off.
[00:56:55.940 --> 00:57:00.180]  But let me just tell you, if you're not filtering your water right now, you're crazy, okay?
[00:57:00.180 --> 00:57:01.180]  You're crazy.
[00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:02.940]  There's all kinds of crap that they're putting in the water.
[00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:06.340]  There's all kinds of crap that they're finding in the water.
[00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:12.540]  From microplastics to lead to glyphosate, not to mention the neurotoxin fluoride that
[00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:15.260]  they put in there intentionally, your loving government.
[00:57:15.260 --> 00:57:18.460]  So please, please filter your water.
[00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:19.900]  Have a water filter at your house.
[00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:20.900]  Drink the clean water.
[00:57:21.580 --> 00:57:23.780]  By the way, if you're drinking bottled water, this is going to save you money in the long
[00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:28.300]  run because it's going to give you much more clean water to drink without having to purchase
[00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:30.980]  all those hundreds of bottles.

[00:57:54.460 --> 00:57:56.140]  in plain view.
[00:57:56.140 --> 00:57:58.900]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:03.180]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number
[00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:08.420]  one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[00:58:08.420 --> 00:58:15.700]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real, pure iodine in
[00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:21.980]  the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine, and so much more.
[00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:28.140]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive
[00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:32.060]  disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:34.300]  Most iodine is bound to other elements, you don't absorb it.
[00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:39.940]  We have X3, all three types of the good iodine together that supercharges your body.
[00:58:39.940 --> 00:58:42.060]  X3 is now back in stock at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:46.020]  It's been sold out for over six months for 25% off.

[00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:55.820]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth, and they've got our
[00:58:55.820 --> 00:58:57.980]  children drinking that.
[00:58:57.980 --> 00:59:03.740]  This is a psychotic death cult, period, case closed, out to get you and your family.
[00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:08.740]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour Group.
[00:59:08.740 --> 00:59:12.020]  It's been around about 15 years, became the biggest company in the last six.
[00:59:12.020 --> 00:59:16.380]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there
[00:59:16.380 --> 00:59:21.580]  that sells for twice the price, and they made it as good in all the studies.
[00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:25.260]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals, but you can go pay
[00:59:25.260 --> 00:59:26.260]  two or three times.
[00:59:26.260 --> 00:59:29.140]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[00:59:29.140 --> 00:59:33.540]  We sell the very best, highest grade water filtration system for half the price of leading
[00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:39.340]  competitor, and the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter
[00:59:39.340 --> 00:59:40.340]  your water.
[00:59:40.340 --> 00:59:41.540]  You should also filter your shower water.
[00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:44.580]  It's another way you absorb this crap, but I'm done talking about that.
[00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:47.220]  The point is you get the filters at m4warstore.com.
[00:59:47.220 --> 00:59:48.220]  They're discounted right now.
[00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:49.220]  Finally back in stock.
[00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:57.220]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:07.060]  Here is an important clip from presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. talking about
[01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:11.220]  how he wants to deal with the corruption in the medical industry.
[01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:17.900]  My censorship was less impactful on my life.
[01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:24.900]  I have, because of my background, because my history as a successful attorney and the
[01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:29.900]  relationships I built over time, I have a certain amount of resilience so that they
[01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:33.900]  could not completely crush me, but there are other people.
[01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:39.900]  There are doctors like Peter McCulloch, who I know is a friend of this show, and Robert
[01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:47.580]  Malone, and Ryan Cole, who are, you know, Ryan Cole is just a, he's a humble physician
[01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:55.580]  and business guy from Idaho, and you're going to now go in and try to take his life, medical
[01:00:55.580 --> 01:01:00.580]  license, and ruin his life and destroy his family so he can't pay his mortgage, and so
[01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:06.580]  many doctors suffered like that, and that is, you know, that's inexcusable, and we need
[01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:10.260]  to make sure that that can never happen again.
[01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:14.260]  And, you know, one of the things I'd love to talk to you guys about sometime is just
[01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:21.260]  the role of the medical boards in de-platforming and censorship.
[01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:34.260]  I just want to say one last thing, which is you brought up this terrible bill in California,
[01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:39.940]  which is now going to, you know, it's a doctor don't treat your patient bill, it's a doctor,
[01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:46.940]  you know, it makes, it does something that is really breathtaking, which is, it shatters
[01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:53.940]  this 2,800-year-old relationship between physicians and their patients that has existed since
[01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:59.940]  Hippocrates, where that patient, you know when you go to your doctor that his duty is
[01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:06.620]  to you, and that he is going to, he's going to use all of his talents, all of his gifts
[01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:13.620]  in healing, he or she, to treat you, keep your confidences, and that you're going to
[01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:17.620]  be the center of his attention, so you tell the truth to him, and you reveal everything
[01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:18.620]  to him.
[01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:25.620]  And we protect that with laws, the doctor-patient privilege laws, so that they're going to give
[01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:28.620]  you, when you go to your doctor, the best treatment possible.
[01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:34.300]  You've now changed that relationship, so the doctor is now not in this special relationship
[01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:37.300]  with the patient, he now becomes an agent of the state.
[01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:39.300]  Correct, yes.
[01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:42.300]  That's what happened.
[01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:52.300]  As terrifying as it is, as we say, as terrifying as it is to a patient, it should be, I mean
[01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:57.300]  to a physician, 2098 is terrifying to physicians, it should be far more terrifying to patients,
[01:02:57.980 --> 01:03:02.980]  because you can no longer trust that the advice, or course of treatment that your physician
[01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:07.980]  is suggesting, is because he or she believes, based on his or her experience, what they've
[01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:12.980]  read in the journals, their background, their training, is the right thing, or is it simply
[01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:16.980]  because they can't afford to lose their license because they've got a mortgage to pay?
[01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:19.980]  So you can't trust what your doctor says.
[01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:23.980]  Or are they treating you for the good of other people?
[01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:25.980]  Right.
[01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:31.660]  So are they, you know, are they giving you this treatment, which is not benefiting you,
[01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:34.660]  but it's good for the community, in their minds?
[01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:35.660]  Right.
[01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:41.660]  And they have this tremendous power, because we represented a lot of these physicians, you
[01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:47.660]  know, one of the things I was doing at CHD was bankrolling cases for these physicians
[01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:52.660]  who were getting steamrolled, and then representing them, and making sure they had good counsel,
[01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:58.340]  and those cases always get bought, we lose them all every time, because the power of
[01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:06.340]  those medical boards, the courts look at them as kind of a club, that they're not really
[01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:13.340]  a governmental organization, that it's a club, and being a doctor is being part of a club,
[01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:17.340]  and if you're part of a club, the club can get rid of you, no matter for good reason
[01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:22.340]  or bad reason, and the club can lie, it can cheat, it can steal, it can do anything.
[01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:28.340]  And the courts can't interfere with it, it's really just a breathtaking power that they
[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:33.340]  exercise, and you know, when I get in there, I'm going to figure out how to fix that.
[01:04:33.340 --> 01:04:38.340]  I don't know exactly how, because they're state operated, but there's going to be, I'm
[01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:47.340]  going to figure out a federal lever to either punish that behavior, or just to make sure
[01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:52.340]  that doctors never victimize again, doctors ought to be able to treat their patients without
[01:04:53.020 --> 01:04:54.020]  somebody looking over their shoulder.
[01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:59.020]  It's been terrible what's happened the last three years, and the doctors are looking
[01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:06.020]  Sold out for more than a year, we now have back in stock a limited run of our extremely

[01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:12.820]  Welcome back my friends.
[01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:16.220]  We're now at our number two of the Alex Joe show on this live Tuesday edition.
[01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:19.220]  Dr. James Lindsay is an incredible man.
[01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:20.220]  He's a mathematician, a scientist.
[01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:24.220]  He's written six books on the whole globalist New World Order program.
[01:06:24.220 --> 01:06:31.220]  And I'm telling you, this guy is probably the best of mine when it comes to describing
[01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:35.220]  the nuances and systems they're using for the total takeover of society.
[01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:37.220]  Now it's a 29 minute speech.
[01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:40.220]  We're not going to air the whole thing here, but we're going to air most of it.
[01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:44.620]  And again, it's been posted on the live show feed at infowarestore.com.
[01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:48.620]  This is a speech he recently gave as a guest at the European Union Parliament.
[01:06:48.620 --> 01:06:51.620]  People are probably going to say, well, I thought the EU was corrupt and bad.
[01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:57.620]  The EU was set up as a steel trade agreement after World War II in 1947 by an unelected
[01:06:57.620 --> 01:06:59.620]  group of corporations.
[01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:04.620]  And then they had the governments sign onto that and give them a blank check of power.
[01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:09.620]  Just like the UN is trying to get us to sign on in other countries to this treaty to take
[01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:11.020]  over our health care right now.
[01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:16.020]  And once they have that blank check and once we go along with it, they will be in charge
[01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:17.020]  of our country.
[01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:20.020]  So it's the very same system over and over again.
[01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:22.020]  So in 1947, they have the steel agreement.
[01:07:22.020 --> 01:07:24.020]  In 1956, they have the Treaty of Rome.
[01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:26.020]  And since then, we've had the European Union.
[01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:31.020]  Now, I remember when I was first on air 30 years ago or 29 years ago, the New York Times
[01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:35.020]  said it was a conspiracy theory that there was even a European Union.
[01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:39.020]  And then all of a sudden, a few years later, they said, OK, it's real and we're taking
[01:07:39.420 --> 01:07:40.420]  over.
[01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:45.420]  And of course, then now they're setting up internal borders to travel in Europe, but
[01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:48.420]  getting rid of the borders outside Europe to flood them with third world replacement
[01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:50.420]  migration populations.
[01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:57.420]  So he does an excellent job explaining what Karl Marx meant by this perfect socialist
[01:07:57.420 --> 01:07:58.420]  society.
[01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:03.420]  And that's the reason in his office, in many photographs taken with him, Klaus Schwab has
[01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:05.820]  a bust of V.I.
[01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:09.820]  Lenin, one of the biggest mass murders in history.
[01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:14.820]  So why are the richest people on Earth financing and funding communism?
[01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:17.820]  We're going to be laying this out more and more here on the broadcast.
[01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:19.820]  I'm writing a book on the subject as well.
[01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:24.820]  But I wanted you to hear large portions of this speech.
[01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:28.820]  And then Owen will come back with breaking news and information and a special guest.
[01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:31.820]  But here is a large excerpt of the EU speech.
[01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:34.220]  Please go get it and share it.
[01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:35.220]  We've uploaded it.
[01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:37.220]  It may not video the whole speech.
[01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:39.220]  Again, it's an info wars dot com.
[01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:43.220]  This information is critical to understand the enemy, because if we just attack one
[01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:49.220]  head of the Hydra, critical race theory or transgenderism or open borders or all the
[01:08:49.220 --> 01:08:51.220]  genetic engineering, they're going to win.
[01:08:51.220 --> 01:08:56.220]  But if we understand the heart and the core to this, quote, scientific takeover, that's
[01:08:56.220 --> 01:08:57.220]  what they say.
[01:08:57.220 --> 01:08:59.220]  Trust the science, because it is scientists running it.
[01:08:59.220 --> 01:09:01.220]  But it's the science of control.
[01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:02.620]  If we understand the big picture, we're going to win.
[01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:05.620]  And I know I hammer that over and over again.
[01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:08.620]  So here is the speech from the beginning.
[01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:11.620]  I want to encourage viewers and listeners again to share this.
[01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:14.620]  And I want to encourage you to remember, only way we stay on air is your financial
[01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:15.620]  support.
[01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:16.620]  And I want to thank you for your support.
[01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:20.620]  Plus, we've got really great products you need, like X3 back in stock, TurboForce back
[01:09:20.620 --> 01:09:21.620]  in stock.

[01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:28.620]  We have the best CBD oil, highest quality, lowest price you're going to find.
[01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:30.620]  That's at info wars dot com.
[01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:33.020]  The nitrate boost that cleans out your blood.
[01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:34.020]  Everybody should be taking that.
[01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:36.020]  It's just amazing what it does.
[01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:38.020]  It's all at info wars dot com.
[01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:42.020]  But let's first now go ahead and go to part of this very important speech.
[01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:47.020]  Woke is Maoism with American characteristics.
[01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:52.020]  If I might borrow from Mao himself, who said that his philosophy was Marxism, Leninism
[01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:54.020]  with Chinese characteristics.
[01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:59.020]  And so when he says we must seize the means of production, and he's talking about factories
[01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:03.420]  He's actually talking about how we construct who we are as human beings so that we might
[01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:07.420]  complete ourselves, so that we might complete history.
[01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:12.420]  And at the end of history, mankind will remember that he is a social being and we will have
[01:10:12.420 --> 01:10:18.420]  a socialist society, a perfect communism that transcends private property.
[01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:19.420]  That's how he put it.
[01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:25.420]  In 1993, Cheryl Harris wrote a long article for the Harvard Law Review called Whiteness
[01:10:25.420 --> 01:10:27.420]  as Property.
[01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:33.820]  She explained that whiteness or white privilege constitutes a kind of cultural private property.
[01:10:33.820 --> 01:10:37.820]  She says it must be abolished in order to have racial justice.
[01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:42.820]  Just like Karl Marx said that in the Communist Manifesto he wrote communism can be summarized
[01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:45.820]  in a single sentence, the abolition of private property.
[01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:50.820]  Why on earth is this very American phenomenon about slavery and so on that doesn't apply
[01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:51.820]  to our country?
[01:10:51.820 --> 01:10:53.820]  Why is it popular here?
[01:10:53.820 --> 01:10:55.820]  It's because it's not about history at all.
[01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:59.220]  It's not about slavery at all.
[01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:01.220]  Those are excuses that they use.
[01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:06.220]  It's about creating a class consciousness that's against this form of property called
[01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:12.220]  whiteness, that's against the dominant culture that may just be a matter of fact, say, if
[01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:13.220]  you're in Europe.
[01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:17.220]  I wrote a book called Race Marxism and I defined critical race theory as it really is.
[01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:21.220]  In that book on the first page, I said that critical race theory is calling everything
[01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:24.220]  you want to control racist until you control it.
[01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:27.620]  Woke is Marxism, evolved to attack the West.
[01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:30.620]  If you don't understand that, you will not act correctly.
[01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:33.620]  You will not cure it and it will conquer your countries.
[01:11:33.620 --> 01:11:40.620]  It will conquer all of Europe and we will have a very, very long, sustainable and inclusive
[01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:42.620]  future with absolutely no freedom.
[01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:49.620]  Hello.
[01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:50.620]  Thank you.
[01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:51.620]  I'm glad to be here.
[01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:58.020]  I want to address something Tom just said, which is in fact that woke is supposed to
[01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:01.020]  advance equity in Europe.
[01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:05.020]  So here's the definition of equity and see if it sounds like a definition of anything
[01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:07.020]  else you've ever heard of.
[01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:11.020]  The definition of equity comes from the public administration literature.
[01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:14.020]  It was written by a man named George Fredrickson.
[01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:20.020]  And the definition is an administered political economy in which shares are adjusted so that
[01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:22.420]  citizens are made equal.
[01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:27.420]  Does that sound like anything you've heard of before?
[01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:29.420]  Like socialism?
[01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:34.420]  They're going to administer an economy to make shares equal.
[01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:40.420]  The only difference between equity and socialism is the type of property that they redistribute,
[01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:42.420]  the type of shares.
[01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:48.420]  They're going to redistribute social and cultural capital in addition to economic and
[01:12:48.820 --> 01:12:49.820]  social capital.
[01:12:49.820 --> 01:12:51.820]  And so this is my thesis.
[01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:58.820]  When we say what is woke, woke is Maoism with American characteristics.
[01:12:58.820 --> 01:13:03.820]  If I might borrow from Mao himself, who said that his philosophy was Marxism-Leninism with
[01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:09.820]  Chinese characteristics, which means woke is Marxism.
[01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:12.820]  And it's a very provocative statement.
[01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:16.820]  It's something you will certainly hear it is not, that it is different.
[01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:22.220]  And the professors and the philosophers will spend a large amount of time explaining to you why.
[01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:23.220]  No, no.
[01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:25.220]  It's about economics when it's Marxism.
[01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:26.220]  This is social.
[01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:27.220]  This is cultural.
[01:13:27.220 --> 01:13:28.220]  This is different.
[01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:29.220]  It's not different.
[01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:31.220]  I need you to think biologically for one moment.
[01:13:31.220 --> 01:13:33.220]  And I don't mean about your bodies.
[01:13:33.220 --> 01:13:34.220]  We could do that.
[01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:36.220]  That's a different topic.
[01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:40.220]  I want you to think how we organize plants and animals when we study them.
[01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:41.220]  They're species.
[01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:45.220]  But above species there are the genus of the animals.
[01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:47.620]  So you think like the cats.
[01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:48.620]  All the cats.
[01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:49.620]  But you have tigers.
[01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:50.620]  You have lions.
[01:13:50.620 --> 01:13:51.620]  You have house cats.
[01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:52.620]  You have whatever.
[01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:53.620]  Leopards.
[01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:55.620]  Many different kinds of cats.
[01:13:55.620 --> 01:14:00.620]  If we think of Marxism as a genus of ideological thought,
[01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:05.620]  then classical economic Marxism is a species.
[01:14:05.620 --> 01:14:09.620]  Radical feminism is a species in this same genus.
[01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:15.020]  Critical race theory is a species in this genus.
[01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:19.020]  Queer theory is a species in this genus.
[01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:24.020]  Post-colonial theory that's plaguing Europe is a species in this genus.
[01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:29.020]  And they have something that binds them together called intersectionality
[01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:31.020]  that makes them treated as if they are all one thing.
[01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:33.020]  But the logic is Marxist.
[01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:35.020]  And I want to convince you of that.
[01:14:35.020 --> 01:14:39.020]  Because Marx had a very simple proposition, but we get lost.
[01:14:39.420 --> 01:14:44.420]  We think that Marx was talking about economics because he often talked about economics.
[01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:46.420]  He wrote a book called Capital.
[01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:48.420]  It's a very famous book.
[01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:50.420]  And we think, well, this is about economic theory.
[01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:52.420]  But this isn't true.
[01:14:52.420 --> 01:14:55.420]  It's only true on the surface.
[01:14:55.420 --> 01:14:59.420]  If we go below the surface, what Marx was talking about was something different.
[01:14:59.420 --> 01:15:04.420]  We know what Marx's hypothesis was, was that we must seize the means of production
[01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:08.820]  to bring socialism to the nations, to the world.
[01:15:08.820 --> 01:15:10.820]  We have to seize the means of production.
[01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:12.820]  So we have to ask, what does he mean?
[01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:16.820]  And if we think that it's about capital, then we miss what he means.
[01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:20.820]  If you think it's about the means of production in the factory with a hammer
[01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:24.820]  and the means of production in the field with a sickle, then you miss what it means.
[01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:30.820]  Because Marx explained what makes human beings special in his earlier writings.
[01:15:31.220 --> 01:15:36.220]  What makes human beings special is that man is a being that is incomplete
[01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:38.220]  and knows that he is incomplete.
[01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:45.220]  He is a man whose true nature has been forgotten to him, which is social being.
[01:15:45.220 --> 01:15:48.220]  He is a socialist at heart who doesn't realize it.
[01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:52.220]  And the reason he doesn't realize it is because of the economic conditions
[01:15:52.220 --> 01:15:56.220]  operating as the means of construction or production,
[01:15:56.620 --> 01:16:02.620]  not just of the economy, but of him, but of man, of society,
[01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:04.620]  and particularly of history.
[01:16:04.620 --> 01:16:07.620]  Marx said that he had the first scientific study of history.
[01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:09.620]  How was history produced?
[01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:13.620]  By man doing man's activity, and man's key activity was economic activity,
[01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:15.620]  as he saw it.
[01:16:15.620 --> 01:16:20.620]  And so economic production doesn't just produce the goods and services of the economy,
[01:16:20.620 --> 01:16:22.620]  it produces society itself.
[01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:26.020]  And society in terms produces man.
[01:16:26.020 --> 01:16:30.020]  He called this the inversion of praxis.
[01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:34.020]  And so when he says we must seize the means of production,
[01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:36.020]  and he's talking about factories and fields,
[01:16:36.020 --> 01:16:40.020]  he's actually talking about how we construct who we are as human beings
[01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:44.020]  so that we might complete ourselves, so that we might complete history.
[01:16:44.020 --> 01:16:49.020]  And at the end of history, mankind will remember that he is a social being
[01:16:49.020 --> 01:16:52.020]  and we will have a socialist society.
[01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:55.420]  This is the perfect communism that transcends private property,
[01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:57.420]  is how he put it.
[01:16:57.420 --> 01:17:01.420]  He said, in fact, that communism is the transcendence of private property
[01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:03.420]  as human self-estrangement.
[01:17:03.420 --> 01:17:09.420]  That's a quote from the Economic Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844.
[01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:14.420]  So Marx was interested in controlling, or understanding and controlling,
[01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:17.420]  how man produces himself.
[01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:21.420]  And he writes about this exclusively in the 1840s.
[01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:22.820]  Very deeply.
[01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:23.820]  How do we do this?
[01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:25.820]  And he looks at the economic conditions and he says,
[01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:26.820]  this is where it is.
[01:17:26.820 --> 01:17:28.820]  And that's why we get economic Marxism.
[01:17:28.820 --> 01:17:30.820]  And that's why we think Marx was an economist.
[01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:32.820]  But Marx was never an economist.
[01:17:32.820 --> 01:17:34.820]  He was a theologian.
[01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:36.820]  He wanted to produce a religion for mankind
[01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:39.820]  that would supersede all of the religions of mankind
[01:17:39.820 --> 01:17:42.820]  and bring him back to his true social nature.
[01:17:42.820 --> 01:17:44.820]  And this is the true fact of Marx.
[01:17:44.820 --> 01:17:47.820]  And what the goal was, like I said, is to complete man.
[01:17:47.820 --> 01:17:50.820]  So what he said is, well, how are we building man currently?
[01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:55.220]  Part of his economic analysis is about how are we building man at present
[01:17:55.220 --> 01:17:58.220]  through what he called material determinism.
[01:17:58.220 --> 01:18:00.220]  And he said, well,
[01:18:00.220 --> 01:18:04.220]  what we have is a special form of private property in our society.
[01:18:04.220 --> 01:18:06.220]  Our society is organized around private property.
[01:18:06.220 --> 01:18:10.220]  So all of our thoughts organize around private property.
[01:18:10.220 --> 01:18:13.220]  In other words, there's a special kind of property
[01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:16.220]  that the bourgeois elite class has access to
[01:18:16.620 --> 01:18:19.620]  and then they organize society to exclude everybody else
[01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:21.620]  from access to that property
[01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:23.620]  through exploitation, through alienation,
[01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:26.620]  through estrangement, through oppression.
[01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:29.620]  And so what Karl Marx was proposing
[01:18:29.620 --> 01:18:32.620]  is that economics becomes a vehicle
[01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:35.620]  to separate society into a bourgeois class
[01:18:35.620 --> 01:18:37.620]  that has access to a special form of property.
[01:18:37.620 --> 01:18:40.620]  The people who have access wish to retain that
[01:18:40.620 --> 01:18:43.620]  so they oppress people and keep other people out of that
[01:18:43.620 --> 01:18:45.620]  special form of property.
[01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:49.020]  They erect a system of classism to do that.
[01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:52.020]  It's enforced by an ideology called capitalism
[01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:56.020]  that believes that this is the right way to engage in the world.
[01:18:56.020 --> 01:18:59.020]  And what we have to do is awaken the underclass,
[01:18:59.020 --> 01:19:02.020]  the proletariat, to the real conditions
[01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:05.020]  and the fact that they are historical agents of change
[01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:08.020]  and bring them to do a revolution
[01:19:08.020 --> 01:19:11.020]  and transform society so that we would have
[01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:14.020]  equity or socialism, whichever word you want.
[01:19:14.420 --> 01:19:16.420]  They have the same definition.
[01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:19.420]  Now let's say that we step out,
[01:19:19.420 --> 01:19:22.420]  we step back from this species, this economic species,
[01:19:22.420 --> 01:19:25.420]  homo economicus, and we step back to the genus
[01:19:25.420 --> 01:19:28.420]  and we look at this idea, a special form of property
[01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:31.420]  that segregates society into people who have
[01:19:31.420 --> 01:19:34.420]  the bourgeois and the people who do not have
[01:19:34.420 --> 01:19:37.420]  who are in class conflict with an ideology
[01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:39.420]  that keeps this in place.
[01:19:39.420 --> 01:19:42.420]  And the underclass must awaken with consciousness
[01:19:42.420 --> 01:19:45.420]  to seize the means of production of that form of
[01:19:45.420 --> 01:19:48.420]  deterministic property.
[01:19:48.420 --> 01:19:51.420]  And now we say, change out class, put in race.
[01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:54.420]  And watch, we get critical race theory falls out of the hat.
[01:19:54.420 --> 01:19:57.420]  Just like that. Very simple.
[01:19:57.420 --> 01:20:00.420]  In 1993, Cheryl Harris wrote a long article
[01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:03.420]  for the Harvard Law Review called
[01:20:03.420 --> 01:20:06.420]  Whiteness as Property.
[01:20:06.420 --> 01:20:09.420]  She explained that whiteness, or white privilege,
[01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:12.420]  is a kind of cultural private property.
[01:20:12.420 --> 01:20:15.420]  She says it must be abolished in order to have racial justice.
[01:20:15.420 --> 01:20:18.420]  Just like Karl Marx said that in the Communist Manifesto
[01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:21.420]  he wrote, communism can be summarized in a single sentence
[01:20:21.420 --> 01:20:24.420]  the abolition of private property.
[01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:27.420]  Well this is why critical race theory calls to abolish whiteness.
[01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:30.420]  Because whiteness is a form of private property.
[01:20:30.420 --> 01:20:33.420]  People who have access to this property
[01:20:33.420 --> 01:20:36.420]  are whites, or white adjacent.
[01:20:36.420 --> 01:20:39.420]  These are words out of the American lexicon
[01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:42.420]  that they've used to describe how
[01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:45.420]  people gain access to the private property.
[01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:48.420]  People without that are people of color.
[01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:51.420]  And they are oppressed by systemic racism.
[01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:54.420]  Systemic racism is enforced by an ideology of white supremacy
[01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:57.420]  instead of capitalism.
[01:20:57.420 --> 01:21:00.420]  If you think of whiteness as a form of cultural capital
[01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:03.420]  white supremacy as they define it is identical to capitalism.
[01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:06.420]  It's not believing that white people are superior.
[01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:09.420]  It's believing that white people have access to the control of society
[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:12.420]  and should maintain that.
[01:21:12.420 --> 01:21:15.420]  Even if you don't actually believe that.
[01:21:15.420 --> 01:21:18.420]  If you merely support that you have adopted
[01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:21.420]  the ideology of white supremacy into your mind.
[01:21:21.420 --> 01:21:24.420]  And so you have the exact same system.
[01:21:24.420 --> 01:21:27.420]  And the goal is to awaken a racial consciousness
[01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:30.420]  in people so that they will band together
[01:21:30.420 --> 01:21:33.420]  as a class and seize the means of cultural production
[01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:36.420]  so that white cultural production is no longer the dominant mode.
[01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:39.420]  It's a big mystery in Europe, I know.
[01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:42.420]  In the UK, throughout Europe, I hear this question again and again.
[01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:45.420]  Why on earth is this very American phenomenon
[01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:48.420]  about slavery and so on that doesn't apply to our country
[01:21:48.420 --> 01:21:51.420]  why is it popular here?
[01:21:51.420 --> 01:21:54.420]  It's because it's not about history at all.
[01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:57.420]  It's not about slavery at all.
[01:21:57.420 --> 01:22:00.420]  It's about creating a class consciousness
[01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:03.420]  that's against this form of property called whiteness.
[01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:06.420]  That's against the dominant culture
[01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:09.420]  that may just be a matter of fact, say, if you're in Europe.
[01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:12.420]  That's why.
[01:22:12.420 --> 01:22:15.420]  Because it becomes a site by which people can come together
[01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:18.420]  and they can channel resentment and try to claim power.
[01:22:18.420 --> 01:22:21.420]  I wrote a book called Race Marxism and I defined critical race theory
[01:22:21.420 --> 01:22:24.420]  as it really is in that book on the first page.
[01:22:24.420 --> 01:22:27.420]  Critical race theory is calling everything you want to control racist
[01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:30.420]  until you control it.
[01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:33.420]  But couldn't we say the same about Marxism?
[01:22:33.420 --> 01:22:36.420]  It's calling everything you want to control bourgeois until you control it.
[01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:39.420]  But those mean the same thing.
[01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:42.420]  They mean exactly the same thing.
[01:22:42.420 --> 01:22:45.420]  But what about, say, queer theory?
[01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:48.420]  How is that Marxist? It's very strange.
[01:22:48.420 --> 01:22:51.420]  All this gender and sex and sexuality.
[01:22:51.420 --> 01:22:54.420]  The idea of being normal.
[01:22:54.420 --> 01:22:57.420]  Well, the queer theory thinks that there are certain people
[01:22:57.420 --> 01:23:00.420]  who get to set the norms of society. They are privileged.
[01:23:00.420 --> 01:23:03.420]  They call themselves normal. They say this is normal.
[01:23:03.420 --> 01:23:06.420]  It's normal to consider yourself a man and look like a man and act like a man
[01:23:06.420 --> 01:23:09.420]  and dress like a man and eat meat like a man.
[01:23:09.420 --> 01:23:12.420]  And then there are women that should be feminine and pretty and all these things.
[01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:15.420]  And so they get to define what's normal.
[01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:18.420]  They're heterosexuals, so they get to define
[01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:21.420]  that heterosexuality is normal and other sexualities are abnormal.
[01:23:21.420 --> 01:23:24.420]  And so you have a conflict across this cultural property
[01:23:24.420 --> 01:23:27.420]  of who gets to be considered normal
[01:23:27.420 --> 01:23:30.420]  and who is a pervert or a freak
[01:23:30.420 --> 01:23:33.420]  or some other term that gets used in their literature.
[01:23:33.420 --> 01:23:36.420]  But technically, who is a queer?
[01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:39.420]  Which sounds like a slur, but they adopted it
[01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:42.420]  and it's a technical academic term now.
[01:23:42.420 --> 01:23:45.420]  It means an identity without an essence, by the way.
[01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:48.420]  An identity that is strictly oppositional to the concept of the normal
[01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:51.420]  as defined by queer theorist David Halperin
[01:23:51.420 --> 01:23:54.420]  in his 1995 book, St. Foucault
[01:23:54.420 --> 01:23:57.420]  Toward a Gay Hagiography.
[01:23:57.420 --> 01:24:00.420]  I didn't make that up. I'm not extrapolating.
[01:24:00.420 --> 01:24:03.420]  So you see, queer theory is just another species
[01:24:03.420 --> 01:24:06.420]  of the genus of Marxism.
[01:24:06.420 --> 01:24:09.420]  What about postcolonial theory, which is plaguing Europe,
[01:24:09.420 --> 01:24:12.420]  thanks to Frantz Fanon and his biggest European fan, Jean-Paul Sartre?
[01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:16.420]  What about this? Well, it's the same.
[01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:19.420]  You have the West as the oppressor.
[01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:22.420]  They have access to the material and cultural wealth of the world
[01:24:22.420 --> 01:24:25.420]  because they've decided their culture is the default
[01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:28.420]  and have gone and colonized the world
[01:24:28.420 --> 01:24:31.420]  to bring culture to the world, as they say.
[01:24:31.420 --> 01:24:34.420]  And so the oppressed, the natives around the world,
[01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:37.420]  the people have to band together
[01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:40.420]  and their activity is going to be called decolonization.
[01:24:41.420 --> 01:24:44.420]  So when they come to Belgium or they come to France
[01:24:44.420 --> 01:24:47.420]  or they come to the United States and they say we're going to decolonize
[01:24:47.420 --> 01:24:50.420]  the curriculum, or they go to the UK and say
[01:24:50.420 --> 01:24:53.420]  we're going to decolonize Shakespeare,
[01:24:53.420 --> 01:24:56.420]  this is what they mean.
[01:24:56.420 --> 01:24:59.420]  We're going to remove the cultural significance of your cultural artifacts
[01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:02.420]  because those cultural artifacts themselves are
[01:25:02.420 --> 01:25:05.420]  oppressive to us.
[01:25:05.420 --> 01:25:08.420]  This is the same system. It's another species
[01:25:08.420 --> 01:25:11.420]  of the exact same genus, and that genus is Marxism,
[01:25:11.420 --> 01:25:14.420]  which is a way of thinking about the world.
[01:25:14.420 --> 01:25:17.420]  And the goal is always to seize the means of control of the production
[01:25:17.420 --> 01:25:20.420]  of man and history and society.
[01:25:20.420 --> 01:25:23.420]  Marx merely believed it was through economic means.
[01:25:23.420 --> 01:25:26.420]  Now it's through socio-cultural means.
[01:25:26.420 --> 01:25:29.420]  The evolution into this sometimes called
[01:25:29.420 --> 01:25:32.420]  Western Marxism began in the 1920s.
[01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:35.420]  We had a Russian revolution in 1917
[01:25:35.420 --> 01:25:38.420]  and this did not happen in Europe.
[01:25:38.420 --> 01:25:41.420]  And the Marxists in Europe were confused.
[01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:44.420]  And so Antonio Gramsci sat down and wrote out some things
[01:25:44.420 --> 01:25:47.420]  and George Lukács sat down and wrote History and Class Consciousness
[01:25:47.420 --> 01:25:50.420]  after the failure of the revolution in Hungary.
[01:25:50.420 --> 01:25:53.420]  And they wrote what became cultural Marxism.
[01:25:53.420 --> 01:25:56.420]  The idea that we have to enter the cultural institutions in order to change them
[01:25:56.420 --> 01:25:59.420]  from within because Western culture has something about it
[01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:02.420]  that's repelling socialism.
[01:26:02.420 --> 01:26:05.420]  So we have to go inside and change the culture to make it socialist.
[01:26:05.420 --> 01:26:08.420]  Now you aren't allowed to talk about cultural Marxism now.
[01:26:08.420 --> 01:26:11.420]  They've categorized this as a conspiracy theory.
[01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:14.420]  They say that it is anti-Semitic.
[01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:17.420]  This is not true. Antonio Gramsci wrote books.
[01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:20.420]  George Lukács wrote books.
[01:26:20.420 --> 01:26:23.420]  You can read those books. They have a philosophy.
[01:26:23.420 --> 01:26:26.420]  If they don't like the name cultural Marxism, we can use the name
[01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:29.420]  that other people at the time used, Western Marxism.
[01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:34.420]  So much like, I don't know, a virus adapting to the conditions,
[01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:37.420]  it changed to try to infect a new host.
[01:26:37.420 --> 01:26:40.420]  It worked in feudal societies. Marxism took over in Russia.
[01:26:40.420 --> 01:26:43.420]  It took over later in China.
[01:26:43.420 --> 01:26:46.420]  It took over in all of these kind of agriculturally driven feudal societies.
[01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:49.420]  But it wouldn't work in actual capitalist nations
[01:26:49.420 --> 01:26:52.420]  because Marx was wrong.
[01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:55.420]  Then several Germans from the Frankfurt School
[01:26:55.420 --> 01:26:58.420]  started to study this phenomenon in more depth
[01:26:58.420 --> 01:27:01.420]  and they evolved the idea further.
[01:27:01.420 --> 01:27:04.420]  They evolved the idea into what's called critical Marxism.
[01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:07.420]  They developed what's called the critical theory.
[01:27:07.420 --> 01:27:10.420]  And Max Horkheimer, who designed the critical theory,
[01:27:10.420 --> 01:27:13.420]  explained the critical theory. And what did he say?
[01:27:13.420 --> 01:27:16.420]  He said, well, what we came to realize was that Marx was wrong about one thing.
[01:27:16.420 --> 01:27:19.420]  Capitalism does not immiserate the worker.
[01:27:19.420 --> 01:27:22.420]  It allows him to build a better life.
[01:27:22.420 --> 01:27:25.420]  So I developed the critical theory because it is not possible
[01:27:25.420 --> 01:27:28.420]  to immiserate the vision of a good society
[01:27:28.420 --> 01:27:31.420]  on the terms of the existing society.
[01:27:31.420 --> 01:27:34.420]  So critical Marxism criticizes the entirety of the existing society.
[01:27:34.420 --> 01:27:37.420]  Everything is somehow
[01:27:37.420 --> 01:27:40.420]  needing to be subjected to Marxist conflict analysis.
[01:27:40.420 --> 01:27:43.420]  But how is that to be done?
[01:27:43.420 --> 01:27:46.420]  They sought an answer
[01:27:46.420 --> 01:27:49.420]  through the middle part of the 20th century
[01:27:49.420 --> 01:27:52.420]  and World War II breaks out.
[01:27:52.420 --> 01:27:55.420]  This metaphor is the Wuhan Institute of Virology
[01:27:55.420 --> 01:27:58.420]  because gain of function began to happen on the Marxist virus very quickly
[01:27:58.420 --> 01:28:01.420]  in America.
[01:28:01.420 --> 01:28:04.420]  And American universities adopted these professors from Germany.
[01:28:04.420 --> 01:28:07.420]  And Herbert Marcuse, writing in the 1960s,
[01:28:07.420 --> 01:28:10.420]  said extremely clearly, this writing in 1969,
[01:28:10.420 --> 01:28:13.420]  not only did he say capitalism delivers the goods,
[01:28:13.420 --> 01:28:16.420]  gives people a good life,
[01:28:16.420 --> 01:28:19.420]  makes them wealthy and comfortable and happy,
[01:28:19.420 --> 01:28:22.420]  he also said that the working class is no longer going to be
[01:28:22.420 --> 01:28:25.420]  the base of the revolution because of these things.
[01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:28.420]  In other words, we don't have to be responsible
[01:28:28.420 --> 01:28:31.420]  to the working class anymore, which opens up the ability
[01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:34.420]  for Marxists who are seeking power to make friends with the corporations.
[01:28:34.420 --> 01:28:37.420]  The bosses are no longer the enemy,
[01:28:37.420 --> 01:28:40.420]  they're an opportunity.
[01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:43.420]  Because the working class is irrelevant.
[01:28:43.420 --> 01:28:46.420]  He said the energy is somewhere else.
[01:28:46.420 --> 01:28:49.420]  The minorities, the feminists, the outsiders,
[01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:52.420]  that's who he said have the energy for a Marxist revolution
[01:28:52.420 --> 01:28:55.420]  in the West, not the working class.
[01:28:55.420 --> 01:28:58.420]  And so Marxism was able to evolve to abandon.
[01:28:58.420 --> 01:29:01.420]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[01:29:01.420 --> 01:29:04.420]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[01:29:04.420 --> 01:29:07.420]  It will change your life.
[01:29:07.420 --> 01:29:10.420]  The UN admits and the Lancet Medical Journal admits
[01:29:10.420 --> 01:29:13.420]  that upwards of 2 billion people have mental disabilities
[01:29:13.420 --> 01:29:16.420]  and declining cognitive abilities.
[01:29:16.420 --> 01:29:19.420]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:22.420]  Most iodine in the environment
[01:29:22.420 --> 01:29:25.420]  is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[01:29:25.420 --> 01:29:28.420]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed
[01:29:28.420 --> 01:29:31.420]  right into the cells.
[01:29:31.420 --> 01:29:34.420]  Infowarsstore.com has the only iodine out there
[01:29:34.420 --> 01:29:37.420]  that actually has this type of full effect.
[01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:40.420]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3 has been sold out for 6 months,
[01:29:40.420 --> 01:29:43.420]  it's very hard to produce, and it's finally back in stock.
[01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:46.420]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[01:29:46.420 --> 01:29:49.420]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful, you and your family need it,
[01:29:49.420 --> 01:29:52.420]  it's 25% off back in stock.
[01:29:52.420 --> 01:29:55.420]  X3, try iodine exclusively at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:29:55.420 --> 01:29:58.420]  Take action now, but regardless, research this info.
[01:29:58.420 --> 01:30:01.420]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution
[01:30:01.420 --> 01:30:04.420]  is laying right there in front of you, hidden in plain view.
[01:30:04.420 --> 01:30:07.420]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[01:30:07.420 --> 01:30:10.420]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website
[01:30:10.420 --> 01:30:13.420]  where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability
[01:30:13.420 --> 01:30:16.420]  in the world is iodine deficiency.
[01:30:16.420 --> 01:30:19.420]  The number one preventable cause
[01:30:19.420 --> 01:30:22.420]  of intellectual disability is lack of
[01:30:22.420 --> 01:30:25.420]  real, pure iodine in the body
[01:30:25.420 --> 01:30:28.420]  as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide,
[01:30:28.420 --> 01:30:31.420]  chlorine, and so much more.
[01:30:31.420 --> 01:30:34.420]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet medical journal study
[01:30:34.420 --> 01:30:37.420]  in 2007 worldwide have cognitive disabilities
[01:30:37.420 --> 01:30:40.420]  because they don't have high quality iodine.
[01:30:40.420 --> 01:30:43.420]  Most iodine is bound to other elements, you don't absorb it.
[01:30:43.420 --> 01:30:46.420]  We have X3, all three types of good iodine together
[01:30:46.420 --> 01:30:49.420]  that supercharges your body.
[01:30:49.420 --> 01:30:52.420]  X3 is now back in stock at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:30:52.420 --> 01:30:55.420]  It's been sold out for over six months for 25% off.
[01:30:55.420 --> 01:30:58.420]  X3, back in stock, take action now, Infowarsstore.com.
[01:30:58.420 --> 01:31:01.420]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil
[01:31:01.420 --> 01:31:04.420]  which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[01:31:04.420 --> 01:31:07.420]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil
[01:31:07.420 --> 01:31:10.420]  of this essential trace element
[01:31:10.420 --> 01:31:13.420]  which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[01:31:13.420 --> 01:31:16.420]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[01:31:16.420 --> 01:31:19.420]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[01:31:19.420 --> 01:31:22.420]  There are plenty of proven technologies
[01:31:22.420 --> 01:31:25.420]  in permaculture and biodynamics
[01:31:25.420 --> 01:31:28.420]  that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[01:31:29.420 --> 01:31:32.420]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day.
[01:31:32.420 --> 01:31:35.420]  Derived from ancient sea salts
[01:31:35.420 --> 01:31:38.420]  found thousands of feet below the earth's surface.
[01:31:38.420 --> 01:31:41.420]  Our Infowars Life Survival Shield X3
[01:31:41.420 --> 01:31:44.420]  is hands down the best.
[01:31:44.420 --> 01:31:47.420]  Pure, nascent iodine
[01:31:47.420 --> 01:31:50.420]  stabilized in an activated triiodine form.
[01:31:50.420 --> 01:31:53.420]  For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism

[01:32:04.420 --> 01:32:07.420]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists
[01:32:07.420 --> 01:32:10.420]  and the fact that we're not caught flat footed during their major takeover
[01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:13.420]  is because of you. Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[01:32:13.420 --> 01:32:16.420]  I just want to thank you all for buying products

[01:32:47.420 --> 01:32:50.420]  of the global awakening, the new renaissance
[01:32:50.420 --> 01:32:53.420]  that's countering the great reset by going to Infowarsstore.com
[01:32:53.420 --> 01:32:56.420]  and clicking on the donate button and giving today.
[01:32:56.420 --> 01:32:59.420]  Thank you so much for your support. Please take action.
[01:33:07.590 --> 01:33:18.590]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:18.590 --> 01:33:20.590]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:33:20.590 --> 01:33:27.590]  Let's go back to this powerful speech from Dr. James Lindsay.
[01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:35.590]  Culture industry, an industry that commodifies and packages culture and sells it back to people.
[01:33:35.590 --> 01:33:40.590]  So supposedly stripped of what it actually is. Empty. Abstract now.
[01:33:40.590 --> 01:33:44.590]  And so what of course did they do? They seized the means of production of the culture industry.
[01:33:44.590 --> 01:33:46.590]  Because that's what they do.
[01:33:46.590 --> 01:33:57.590]  And so they started to transform the culture industry to sell racial, sexual, gender, sexuality based, agitprop.
[01:33:57.590 --> 01:34:00.590]  As though that were genuine culture.
[01:34:00.590 --> 01:34:04.590]  And so we get concepts like cultural appropriation.
[01:34:04.590 --> 01:34:10.590]  We get concepts like cultural relevance, cultural this, cultural that, cultural everything.
[01:34:10.590 --> 01:34:12.590]  And it's all provided in pastiche.
[01:34:12.590 --> 01:34:19.590]  It's all provided as a mockery of what's really going on.
[01:34:19.590 --> 01:34:25.590]  And this evolved in America's highly racialized context.
[01:34:26.590 --> 01:34:32.590]  A form of identity based Marxism. A constellation of Marxist species.
[01:34:32.590 --> 01:34:42.590]  That all work with the same operating premise but locate themselves in different, and I'll use the German term here for this, folk.
[01:34:42.590 --> 01:34:45.590]  LGBTQ is a folk.
[01:34:45.590 --> 01:34:49.590]  And they get folkish identity there and become activists.
[01:34:49.590 --> 01:34:52.590]  The black community is a folk.
[01:34:52.590 --> 01:34:53.590]  How do I know?
[01:34:53.590 --> 01:34:59.590]  That's what W.E.B. Du Bois said it would be when he laid down the foundations that became critical race theory later.
[01:34:59.590 --> 01:35:02.590]  They think of themselves as nations.
[01:35:02.590 --> 01:35:03.590]  Don't they all have flags?
[01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:05.590]  Don't they put them on your buildings like colonizers?
[01:35:05.590 --> 01:35:07.590]  Don't they hang them in your streets?
[01:35:07.590 --> 01:35:10.590]  They think of themselves as occupying nations.
[01:35:10.590 --> 01:35:17.590]  But they see themselves as bound together just like the various colonized nations around the world in seeking liberation from western civilization.
[01:35:17.590 --> 01:35:21.590]  And so we end up with western Marxism taking many forms.
[01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:24.590]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, now this is a long speech.
[01:35:24.590 --> 01:35:26.590]  There is some time remaining on it.
[01:35:26.590 --> 01:35:34.590]  We're going to stop this right here, and I will let you know the full speech will be posted to Band.Video.
[01:35:34.590 --> 01:35:36.590]  In fact, it's already up on Band.Video.
[01:35:36.590 --> 01:35:38.590]  If you guys could just put that on the screen for me, I'll give them the title.
[01:35:38.590 --> 01:35:42.590]  And, of course, the link is also at Infowars.com.
[01:35:42.590 --> 01:35:48.590]  So if you're looking for the full clip there, the full video, Infowars.com and Band.Video,
[01:35:48.590 --> 01:35:51.590]  there's a channel called Transwar on Humanity.
[01:35:51.590 --> 01:35:56.590]  And the title is Woke Culture is Modern Maoism Tailor-Made to Destroy the West.
[01:35:56.590 --> 01:36:03.590]  And that's where you can find that full video clip as well as many other video clips on Band.Video.
[01:36:03.590 --> 01:36:11.590]  Banned video clips that the corrupt establishment, the corrupt government does not want you to see.
[01:36:11.590 --> 01:36:14.590]  All right, I do have a bunch of news.
[01:36:14.590 --> 01:36:23.590]  On the other side, though, after this segment, Alex Jones is going to be returning with some other major breaking news reports.
[01:36:23.590 --> 01:36:40.590]  And now they're claiming this individual Sai Varshith Kandula who rammed a U-Haul video into a structure in Washington, D.C. by the White House.
[01:36:40.590 --> 01:36:42.590]  I guess it was the White House gate.
[01:36:42.590 --> 01:36:47.590]  And then had the Nazi flag perfectly laid out.
[01:36:47.590 --> 01:36:48.590]  Isn't it amazing?
[01:36:48.590 --> 01:36:56.590]  This is the video clip we get of a Nazi flag just perfectly laid out on the ground of the U-Haul crashed into the gate there.
[01:36:56.590 --> 01:36:58.590]  I mean, even the crash is suspect.
[01:36:58.590 --> 01:37:02.590]  I just doubt the whole thing.
[01:37:02.590 --> 01:37:03.590]  I'm sorry.
[01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:05.590]  It's just so absurd.
[01:37:05.590 --> 01:37:10.590]  It does beg a lot of questions, no doubt.
[01:37:10.590 --> 01:37:13.590]  But once again, this is clearly propaganda.
[01:37:13.590 --> 01:37:15.590]  This is clearly words have no meaning.
[01:37:15.590 --> 01:37:27.590]  And if anything, this is a deranged, lunatic individual that obviously has mental problems at his young age of 19.
[01:37:27.590 --> 01:37:31.590]  So we'll see what happens with more background information on this.
[01:37:31.590 --> 01:37:36.590]  But they're running their same gambit.
[01:37:36.590 --> 01:37:37.590]  Oh, it's a Nazi.
[01:37:37.590 --> 01:37:38.590]  Oh, it's a white supremacist.
[01:37:38.590 --> 01:37:39.590]  It's just absurd.
[01:37:39.590 --> 01:37:40.590]  And they don't mean Nazi.
[01:37:40.590 --> 01:37:42.590]  They don't mean white supremacist.
[01:37:42.590 --> 01:37:43.590]  That is propaganda.
[01:37:43.590 --> 01:37:48.590]  That is code language for Trump supporter, Christian, conservative, white man, Republican.
[01:37:48.590 --> 01:37:50.590]  That's what they really want you to think.
[01:37:50.590 --> 01:37:53.590]  That's the connection they want you to make in your head.
[01:37:53.590 --> 01:38:00.590]  That's why they're constantly calling those groups Nazis and white supremacists, even when they're black people or Jewish people.
[01:38:00.590 --> 01:38:02.590]  Yeah, a Jewish person that votes for Trump is a Nazi.
[01:38:02.590 --> 01:38:05.590]  Yeah, a black person that votes for Trump is a white supremacist.
[01:38:05.590 --> 01:38:07.590]  You liberal Democrats are sick freaks.
[01:38:08.590 --> 01:38:12.590]  And now you've got Representative Jayapal.
[01:38:12.590 --> 01:38:17.590]  Is she encouraging an insurrection?
[01:38:17.590 --> 01:38:25.590]  Is Democrat Representative Jayapal encouraging an insurrection in clip four?
[01:38:25.590 --> 01:38:34.590]  I think there would be a huge backlash from our entire House Democratic caucus, certainly the progressives, but also in the streets.
[01:38:34.590 --> 01:38:44.590]  You know, I mean, I think that this is it's important that we don't take steps back from the very strong agenda that the president himself shepherded and led over the last two years.
[01:38:44.590 --> 01:38:51.590]  But if the president agrees to spending caps or if he agrees to work requirements on certain social safety net programs.
[01:38:51.590 --> 01:38:52.590]  It's going to be a problem.
[01:38:52.590 --> 01:38:56.590]  We do not legislate through the debt ceiling for this very reason.
[01:38:56.590 --> 01:38:58.590]  There's going to be backlash.
[01:38:58.590 --> 01:38:59.590]  It's going to be in the streets.
[01:38:59.590 --> 01:39:01.590]  It's going to be a problem.
[01:39:01.590 --> 01:39:04.590]  Are the liberal Democrats getting ready to peacefully riot again?
[01:39:04.590 --> 01:39:08.590]  Are the liberal Democrats getting ready to to fiery protest again?
[01:39:08.590 --> 01:39:13.590]  Is another Democrat summer of rage ahead of us?
[01:39:13.590 --> 01:39:15.590]  Isn't it just.
[01:39:15.590 --> 01:39:18.590]  It's sad, though, actually.
[01:39:18.590 --> 01:39:20.590]  It's sad that these people are such scum.
[01:39:20.590 --> 01:39:22.590]  It's sad that these people are such liars.
[01:39:22.590 --> 01:39:25.590]  And it's sad that they it's like they don't even have a soul.
[01:39:25.590 --> 01:39:27.590]  They don't even have a conscious.
[01:39:27.590 --> 01:39:29.590]  They don't even have a moral compass.
[01:39:29.590 --> 01:39:32.590]  They just destroy.
[01:39:32.590 --> 01:39:36.590]  They just lie, deceive, destroy.
[01:39:36.590 --> 01:39:44.590]  And they'll arrest anybody on the opposite side of the political aisle that dare steps foot outside their house in a form of peaceful political protest.
[01:39:44.590 --> 01:39:48.590]  But they encourage writing and violence.
[01:39:48.590 --> 01:39:51.590]  And they say that's justified because you're a leftist.
[01:39:51.590 --> 01:39:52.590]  You're a liberal.
[01:39:52.590 --> 01:39:53.590]  You're fighting Nazis.
[01:39:53.590 --> 01:39:55.590]  All lies, all propaganda.
[01:39:55.590 --> 01:40:01.590]  But then when you have a real problem like this.
[01:40:01.590 --> 01:40:09.590]  Jose Roberto Hernandez Espinal, you won't hear about this white supremacist being facetious.
[01:40:09.590 --> 01:40:14.590]  An illegal immigrant who raped a woman last Tuesday on a hiking trail.
[01:40:14.590 --> 01:40:18.590]  Days before that, he raped a 15 year old girl.
[01:40:18.590 --> 01:40:20.590]  This happened in Montgomery County, Maryland.
[01:40:20.590 --> 01:40:24.590]  Jose has been in America illegally since 2013.
[01:40:24.590 --> 01:40:32.590]  In 2019, county executive Mark Elrick, a far left Democrat, made Montgomery County a sanctuary county by executive order.
[01:40:32.590 --> 01:40:37.590]  The order made it illegal for police to ask about immigration status or cooperate with ICE.
[01:40:37.590 --> 01:40:41.590]  This is what the far left American Democrats want for us.
[01:40:41.590 --> 01:40:44.590]  A child was raped because the liberals put America last.
[01:40:44.590 --> 01:40:46.590]  But you won't hear about that.
[01:40:46.590 --> 01:40:48.590]  You won't hear about that criminal.
[01:40:48.590 --> 01:40:51.590]  You won't hear about his victims.
[01:40:51.590 --> 01:40:55.590]  He won't be called a white supremacist.
[01:40:55.590 --> 01:41:01.590]  They won't lay a Nazi flag out of the crime scene where he raped people.
[01:41:01.590 --> 01:41:05.590]  No, don't expect that.
[01:41:05.590 --> 01:41:07.590]  Now here's Joe Biden.
[01:41:07.590 --> 01:41:09.590]  This guy can't stop lying.
[01:41:09.590 --> 01:41:12.590]  He's told this lie about a dozen times now.
[01:41:12.590 --> 01:41:16.590]  See if you catch the big lie that Biden keeps telling here in clip one.
[01:41:16.590 --> 01:41:18.590]  He's in Japan talking to troops.
[01:41:18.590 --> 01:41:19.590]  Here it is.
[01:41:19.590 --> 01:41:23.590]  My son was a major in the U.S. Army.
[01:41:23.590 --> 01:41:27.590]  Lost him in Iraq.
[01:41:27.590 --> 01:41:28.590]  So OK, there you go.
[01:41:28.590 --> 01:41:29.590]  That's fine.
[01:41:29.590 --> 01:41:30.590]  It's bad audio.
[01:41:30.590 --> 01:41:33.590]  He says that his son, Beau, died in Iraq.
[01:41:33.590 --> 01:41:36.590]  Folks, that's just a lie.
[01:41:36.590 --> 01:41:38.590]  It's just a flat out lie.
[01:41:38.590 --> 01:41:46.590]  So is Joe Biden lying about his son for clout, for political clout, for votes?
[01:41:46.590 --> 01:41:55.590]  Or is Joe Biden's brain so broken, so damaged, that he actually thinks his son died in Iraq?
[01:41:55.590 --> 01:42:02.590]  Either way you slice it, it's not good.
[01:42:02.590 --> 01:42:07.590]  It's not good.
[01:42:07.590 --> 01:42:10.590]  Then you've got here in clip five, I guess we can get ready for more of this.
[01:42:10.590 --> 01:42:15.590]  Pro-abortion professor curses at pro-life students and vandalizes their table.
[01:42:15.590 --> 01:42:18.590]  Just put the B-roll on the screen as we go to break here.
[01:42:18.590 --> 01:42:19.590]  This is the left, folks.
[01:42:19.590 --> 01:42:21.590]  They encourage their side to get violent.
[01:42:21.590 --> 01:42:26.590]  They encourage their side to get violent, get radical, and commit crimes and hurt people.
[01:42:26.590 --> 01:42:27.590]  And they say it's justified.
[01:42:27.590 --> 01:42:28.590]  You're fighting Nazis.
[01:42:28.590 --> 01:42:30.590]  You're fighting white supremacists.
[01:42:30.590 --> 01:42:36.590]  And then if a conservative steps out onto the White House grass with a sign that says free speech,
[01:42:36.590 --> 01:42:40.590]  well, they're going to end up in jail and their lives are going to be destroyed
[01:42:40.590 --> 01:42:42.590]  and their information is going to be turned over to the FBI.
[01:42:42.590 --> 01:42:45.590]  So, yes, the understanding is this.
[01:42:45.590 --> 01:42:51.590]  The largest terrorist hate group in the United States of America is the Democrat Party.
[01:42:51.590 --> 01:42:59.590]  This needs to be understood and taught to our children.
[01:42:59.590 --> 01:43:04.590]  This is Adam King, host of the Adam King Show, joined by the one and only Greg Reiss of the Reiss Report.
[01:43:04.590 --> 01:43:07.590]  We wanted to hop on and send everybody to Infowarsstore.com.

[01:43:16.590 --> 01:43:17.590]  Greg, what do you got there?
[01:43:17.590 --> 01:43:22.590]  If you really want to treat yourself to something nice, get yourself an Alexa Pure water filter
[01:43:22.590 --> 01:43:26.590]  and get clean, healthy water whenever you want it, wherever you want it.
[01:43:26.590 --> 01:43:32.590]  Even if the water pressure goes out, the gravity-fed water filter has got you covered.
[01:43:32.590 --> 01:43:33.590]  Absolutely.
[01:43:33.590 --> 01:43:38.590]  And we couldn't do any of this without listener support.
[01:43:38.590 --> 01:43:43.590]  I was telling Greg earlier, we're like the real NPR, the real NPR of the base, right?

[01:43:46.590 --> 01:43:47.590]  Take out your phone.

[01:43:48.590 --> 01:43:50.590]  It will take you directly to Infowarsstore.com.
[01:43:50.590 --> 01:43:51.590]  Buy something.
[01:43:51.590 --> 01:43:52.590]  Support the Infowar.
[01:43:52.590 --> 01:43:56.590]  Keep Alex Jones, Orange Royer, Harrison Smith, Greg Reiss, Adam King, and the rest of us on air.
[01:43:56.590 --> 01:43:57.590]  Do it today.
[01:43:57.590 --> 01:43:58.590]  Do it now.
[01:43:58.590 --> 01:43:59.590]  Support the Infowar.
[01:43:59.590 --> 01:44:04.590]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[01:44:04.590 --> 01:44:08.590]  A flying disc has been found and is now in the possession of the Army.
[01:44:08.590 --> 01:44:10.590]  Here is a bulletin from CBS News.
[01:44:10.590 --> 01:44:12.590]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[01:44:12.590 --> 01:44:16.590]  This is a different kind of war.
[01:44:16.590 --> 01:44:20.590]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets at the Peterhose.
[01:44:20.590 --> 01:44:24.590]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[01:44:24.590 --> 01:44:28.590]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[01:44:28.590 --> 01:44:30.590]  It was almost as if there were a plan in motion.
[01:44:30.590 --> 01:44:32.590]  It just happened.
[01:44:32.590 --> 01:44:34.590]  We need to go into the Capitol.
[01:44:34.590 --> 01:44:36.590]  Set, set, set.
[01:44:36.590 --> 01:44:38.590]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[01:44:38.590 --> 01:44:40.590]  They are nothing but distraction.
[01:44:40.590 --> 01:44:42.590]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[01:44:42.590 --> 01:44:44.590]  You silenced those voices.
[01:44:44.590 --> 01:44:48.590]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[01:44:48.590 --> 01:44:55.590]  Soon as we start exposing the Great Reset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison.
[01:45:02.590 --> 01:45:04.590]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:45:04.590 --> 01:45:06.590]  This is their big move.
[01:45:06.590 --> 01:45:10.590]  So yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[01:45:10.590 --> 01:45:12.590]  He doesn't care.
[01:45:12.590 --> 01:45:14.590]  That's not his job.
[01:45:14.590 --> 01:45:16.590]  He's not the president of the United States.
[01:45:16.590 --> 01:45:18.590]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[01:45:18.590 --> 01:45:22.590]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[01:45:22.590 --> 01:45:24.590]  They must be opposed.
[01:45:24.590 --> 01:45:26.590]  And that's who he works with.
[01:45:26.590 --> 01:45:28.590]  Autocrats only understand one word.
[01:45:28.590 --> 01:45:30.590]  No, no, no.
[01:45:30.590 --> 01:45:32.590]  Exactly.
[01:45:32.590 --> 01:45:34.590]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[01:45:34.590 --> 01:45:38.590]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[01:45:38.590 --> 01:45:40.590]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[01:45:40.590 --> 01:45:42.590]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[01:45:42.590 --> 01:45:46.590]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[01:45:46.590 --> 01:45:48.590]  We say no to you getting us into World War III.
[01:45:48.590 --> 01:45:50.590]  You're right.
[01:45:50.590 --> 01:45:52.590]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden.
[01:45:52.590 --> 01:45:54.590]  And we say no.
[01:45:54.590 --> 01:45:56.590]  And we say no to your war.
[01:45:56.590 --> 01:46:06.590]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[01:46:06.590 --> 01:46:10.590]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[01:46:10.590 --> 01:46:18.590]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid.
[01:46:18.590 --> 01:46:20.590]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[01:46:20.590 --> 01:46:24.590]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison.
[01:46:24.590 --> 01:46:26.590]  And there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[01:46:26.590 --> 01:46:34.590]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury, who was responsible for the Public Health Service at the time.
[01:46:34.590 --> 01:46:44.590]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product and dumping it into our drinking water.
[01:46:44.590 --> 01:46:48.590]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[01:46:48.590 --> 01:46:52.590]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water.
[01:46:52.590 --> 01:46:54.590]  And a remedy to this madness.
[01:46:54.590 --> 01:46:58.590]  Available now at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:46:58.590 --> 01:47:04.590]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:47:04.590 --> 01:47:06.590]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:06.590 --> 01:47:14.590]  Welcome back to Segment 5 of the second hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:14.590 --> 01:47:16.590]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:47:16.590 --> 01:47:22.590]  We have a special guest, an amazing pastor with millions and millions of viewers and listeners.
[01:47:22.590 --> 01:47:26.590]  Who's moved to Texas and is doing a great job on the border.
[01:47:26.590 --> 01:47:28.590]  Covering what's happening there.
[01:47:28.590 --> 01:47:32.590]  He'll be joining us coming up in the next hour in studio.
[01:47:32.590 --> 01:47:38.590]  But I wanted to point out to the viewers and listeners that we really are facing a satanic conspiracy.
[01:47:38.590 --> 01:47:44.590]  And people that hear about that on the surface, who don't know history, think that sounds crazy.
[01:47:44.590 --> 01:47:46.590]  Every human culture goes through cycles.
[01:47:46.590 --> 01:47:50.590]  And during the collapse portion of the cycle, before rebirth.
[01:47:50.590 --> 01:47:54.590]  What can only be described as demonic, satanic cults take over.
[01:47:54.590 --> 01:48:00.590]  Doesn't matter if it's in ancient Asia or Africa or Europe or Mesoamerica.
[01:48:00.590 --> 01:48:04.590]  The exact same thing happens over and over again.
[01:48:04.590 --> 01:48:10.590]  And at the heart of Hollywood and at the heart of all these systems is satanism.
[01:48:10.590 --> 01:48:16.590]  There was a report on Infowars.com yesterday that I'm going to be filing a report on tomorrow.
[01:48:16.590 --> 01:48:20.590]  Because I want to put all the imagery together because there's so much of it.
[01:48:20.590 --> 01:48:28.590]  That Target stores haven't just come out with whole sections nationwide, worldwide, wherever they have stores.
[01:48:28.590 --> 01:48:32.590]  Teaching girls they're boys, boys they're girls.
[01:48:32.590 --> 01:48:36.590]  And just all this other crazy dehumanization garbage.
[01:48:36.590 --> 01:48:44.590]  But they're also selling toys and apparel that shows guillotines and it says kill anti-trans.
[01:48:44.590 --> 01:48:48.590]  And it's not just that one shirt or that one piece of apparel.
[01:48:48.590 --> 01:48:56.590]  Literally dozens and dozens of pieces of apparel, clothing, jewelry saying we love satan.
[01:48:56.590 --> 01:49:00.590]  And we're going to start killing people that are oppressing trans.
[01:49:00.590 --> 01:49:06.590]  Well the trans people are killing themselves because the drugs they're put on how they're brainwashed.
[01:49:06.590 --> 01:49:10.590]  The NIH just did a big study of 200 people and two of them committed suicide.
[01:49:10.590 --> 01:49:12.590]  A bunch of others were completely crazy.
[01:49:12.590 --> 01:49:18.590]  We're talking kids, young children, 8, 9, 10, 11 years old that they put on these drugs.
[01:49:18.590 --> 01:49:20.590]  So this is mind control.
[01:49:20.590 --> 01:49:22.590]  They take them, they tell them they're another sex.
[01:49:22.590 --> 01:49:24.590]  They put them on a bunch of drugs.
[01:49:24.590 --> 01:49:26.590]  They stunt their growth.
[01:49:26.590 --> 01:49:28.590]  They cause all these health problems.
[01:49:28.590 --> 01:49:30.590]  They just cut their genitals off.
[01:49:30.590 --> 01:49:37.590]  And then when they're unhappy and depressed, they blame society and say you're being attacked.
[01:49:37.590 --> 01:49:41.590]  And of course we now know they're suppressing the transgender attacker in Tennessee's manifesto.
[01:49:41.590 --> 01:49:48.590]  Because the word is of course she was anti-Christian and pissed off and also attacked the school chapel.
[01:49:48.590 --> 01:49:50.590]  But the media suppressed that.
[01:49:50.590 --> 01:49:54.590]  So openly saying they love satanism.
[01:49:54.590 --> 01:49:58.590]  I put on screen right now that Target article from Infowars.com.
[01:49:58.590 --> 01:50:01.590]  I mean go read the article and look at it.
[01:50:01.590 --> 01:50:05.590]  It's got more than 10 tweets in it with images of what's being sold in Target.
[01:50:05.590 --> 01:50:09.590]  But I spent like an hour yesterday going through the full apparel line.
[01:50:09.590 --> 01:50:12.590]  And I'm telling you ladies and gentlemen, it's we love satan.
[01:50:12.590 --> 01:50:13.590]  We love death.
[01:50:13.590 --> 01:50:14.590]  We're going to kill people.
[01:50:14.590 --> 01:50:16.590]  We're going to chop your heads off.
[01:50:16.590 --> 01:50:20.590]  We're going to smash your head with clubs and with hammers and with maces.
[01:50:20.590 --> 01:50:21.590]  We're coming.
[01:50:21.590 --> 01:50:22.590]  We're an army.
[01:50:22.590 --> 01:50:23.590]  We're going to slaughter you.
[01:50:23.590 --> 01:50:26.590]  This is Target doing this.
[01:50:26.590 --> 01:50:27.590]  Okay.
[01:50:27.590 --> 01:50:30.590]  They're absolutely proud of this.
[01:50:30.590 --> 01:50:32.590]  They're coming after our children.
[01:50:32.590 --> 01:50:35.590]  This is the externalization of the hierarchy.
[01:50:35.590 --> 01:50:36.590]  Externalization of the method.
[01:50:36.590 --> 01:50:39.590]  This is satanism period.
[01:50:39.590 --> 01:50:43.590]  So Gregory sent a quick report on Ricky Schroeder.
[01:50:43.590 --> 01:50:47.590]  Who obviously is a famous Hollywood child actor.
[01:50:47.590 --> 01:50:51.590]  Saying that they basically tried to induct him into one of these cults.
[01:50:51.590 --> 01:50:53.590]  And I can tell you from a lot of sources and it's also come out.
[01:50:53.590 --> 01:50:57.590]  This is absolutely dead on and absolutely how they do it.
[01:50:57.590 --> 01:50:58.590]  And this is how they recruit you.
[01:50:58.590 --> 01:50:59.590]  So here's the report.
[01:50:59.590 --> 01:51:02.590]  We'll be back with Owen Schroeder and a special guest in studio.
[01:51:09.590 --> 01:51:12.590]  Alex Jones revealed over 20 years ago.
[01:51:12.590 --> 01:51:17.590]  How world elites reenact human sacrifice every year at Bohemian Grove.
[01:51:18.590 --> 01:51:20.590]  Next summer sets us free.
[01:51:28.590 --> 01:51:30.590]  And there have been several whistleblowers.
[01:51:30.590 --> 01:51:36.590]  Reporting that satanic ritual sacrifice is at the highest levels of our society.
[01:51:36.590 --> 01:51:42.590]  Ritualized murder is after all the ultimate expression of tyranny.
[01:51:42.590 --> 01:51:45.590]  And as disturbing as it is to most people.
[01:51:45.590 --> 01:51:48.590]  It is commonly been used as a form of blackmail.
[01:51:48.590 --> 01:51:51.590]  Former child actor Rick Schroeder.
[01:51:51.590 --> 01:51:55.590]  Recently released a video of a childhood experience he had in Hollywood.
[01:51:55.590 --> 01:51:58.590]  Where he believes he met members of this cult.
[01:52:00.590 --> 01:52:01.590]  Let me explain.
[01:52:01.590 --> 01:52:04.590]  When I was young I couldn't drive yet.
[01:52:06.590 --> 01:52:08.590]  I was hanging out with the older guys.
[01:52:09.590 --> 01:52:11.590]  And on point doom.
[01:52:13.590 --> 01:52:16.590]  Somebody popped in a cassette tape into a VHS player.
[01:52:17.590 --> 01:52:18.590]  And.
[01:52:20.590 --> 01:52:22.590]  There was a room with a body.
[01:52:23.590 --> 01:52:25.590]  I believe it was a male laying on a table.
[01:52:26.590 --> 01:52:28.590]  And people came around the room.
[01:52:28.590 --> 01:52:31.590]  It was dimly lit but they had hoods and robes on.
[01:52:32.590 --> 01:52:35.590]  And they had some sort of ritual.
[01:52:35.590 --> 01:52:37.590]  They had some sort of ritual.
[01:52:37.590 --> 01:52:39.590]  Where they took out a knife.
[01:52:39.590 --> 01:52:41.590]  And they cut him down the side.
[01:52:43.590 --> 01:52:44.590]  It was his right side.
[01:52:45.590 --> 01:52:48.590]  And they took out parts of him.
[01:52:48.590 --> 01:52:50.590]  And the blood started flowing.
[01:52:51.590 --> 01:52:53.590]  And they were chanting.
[01:52:57.590 --> 01:52:58.590]  There was women there.
[01:52:58.590 --> 01:53:00.590]  And they took off their clothes.
[01:53:00.590 --> 01:53:02.590]  And then they took the blood.
[01:53:02.590 --> 01:53:04.590]  And they smeared it on their bodies.
[01:53:04.590 --> 01:53:07.590]  And started to be sexual with each other.
[01:53:09.590 --> 01:53:12.590]  It was quite disturbing to see.
[01:53:13.590 --> 01:53:14.590]  And so.
[01:53:17.590 --> 01:53:18.590]  They gave me the cassette.
[01:53:18.590 --> 01:53:20.590]  And I took the cassette to somebody I trusted.
[01:53:21.590 --> 01:53:23.590]  And we watched it.
[01:53:24.590 --> 01:53:26.590]  And they said.
[01:53:28.590 --> 01:53:29.590]  Never watch that again.
[01:53:30.590 --> 01:53:32.590]  And give it back to whoever gave it to you.
[01:53:35.590 --> 01:53:36.590]  So I did that.
[01:53:36.590 --> 01:53:43.590]  But I was always confused about why they didn't ask where it came from.
[01:53:45.590 --> 01:53:46.590]  And so.
[01:53:46.590 --> 01:53:52.590]  I believe that I met some of the cult members when I was younger.
[01:53:53.590 --> 01:53:56.590]  If in fact we have no accountability or justice.
[01:53:56.590 --> 01:54:01.590]  It could be because these people that are supposed to bring us justice.
[01:54:02.590 --> 01:54:04.590]  And protect and defend the constitution.
[01:54:04.590 --> 01:54:06.590]  Are corrupted by this cult.
[01:54:07.590 --> 01:54:08.590]  I have no fear of them.
[01:54:09.590 --> 01:54:12.590]  I only fear Jesus.
[01:54:13.590 --> 01:54:14.590]  And so.
[01:54:16.590 --> 01:54:18.590]  Perhaps whoever is investigating these folks.
[01:54:19.590 --> 01:54:20.590]  Needs to.
[01:54:21.590 --> 01:54:23.590]  We need to go a layer below the top.
[01:54:24.590 --> 01:54:25.590]  And come up from the mid-level.
[01:54:26.590 --> 01:54:27.590]  Who are not cult members.
[01:54:28.590 --> 01:54:30.590]  Been blackmailed by the cult possibly.
[01:54:31.590 --> 01:54:33.590]  Because that's the only explanation I have.
[01:54:34.590 --> 01:54:37.590]  For why we haven't had accountability and justice.
[01:54:38.590 --> 01:54:39.590]  For what they've done to America.
[01:54:39.590 --> 01:54:41.590]  And continue to do to America.
[01:54:41.590 --> 01:54:44.590]  While we all just watch.
[01:54:45.590 --> 01:54:46.590]  So.
[01:54:47.590 --> 01:54:49.590]  I share this with the hope that.
[01:54:50.590 --> 01:54:53.590]  Those mid-level people that are investigating it.
[01:54:53.590 --> 01:54:55.590]  The FBI and the CIA.
[01:54:57.590 --> 01:54:58.590]  Will.
[01:54:59.590 --> 01:55:00.590]  Understand.
[01:55:01.590 --> 01:55:03.590]  That their superiors perhaps.
[01:55:04.590 --> 01:55:05.590]  Will never.
[01:55:07.590 --> 01:55:08.590]  Give us justice.
[01:55:09.590 --> 01:55:12.590]  Because of the level of blackmail involved.
[01:55:14.590 --> 01:55:16.590]  Alright that's off my chest.
[01:55:16.590 --> 01:55:17.590]  That feels better.
[01:55:17.590 --> 01:55:18.590]  Now you all know.
[01:55:19.590 --> 01:55:20.590]  God bless America.
[01:55:21.590 --> 01:55:22.590]  And God bless those.
[01:55:23.590 --> 01:55:24.590]  Trying to defeat this cult.
[01:55:25.590 --> 01:55:27.590]  In Jesus name I give you this message.
[01:55:27.590 --> 01:55:28.590]  Amen.
[01:55:30.590 --> 01:55:31.590]  Thank you.
[01:56:00.590 --> 01:56:01.590]  We're going to use to bash our brains out.
[01:56:02.590 --> 01:56:03.590]  And here is the.
[01:56:03.590 --> 01:56:04.590]  Sickest thing.
[01:56:05.590 --> 01:56:06.590]  Hands down.
[01:56:07.590 --> 01:56:08.590]  Out of all these.
[01:56:08.590 --> 01:56:09.590]  Images.
[01:56:10.590 --> 01:56:11.590]  And it says it all.
[01:56:12.590 --> 01:56:13.590]  It is.
[01:56:13.590 --> 01:56:14.590]  A adult skeleton.
[01:56:15.590 --> 01:56:16.590]  In a church.
[01:56:16.590 --> 01:56:17.590]  Saying it's a religion.
[01:56:17.590 --> 01:56:18.590]  Saying it's a cult.
[01:56:18.590 --> 01:56:19.590]  And they admit this.
[01:56:19.590 --> 01:56:20.590]  And actually the t-shirts say this is a cult.
[01:56:20.590 --> 01:56:21.590]  This is a death cult.
[01:56:21.590 --> 01:56:22.590]  It's a satanic cult.
[01:56:22.590 --> 01:56:23.590]  Join our cult.
[01:56:23.590 --> 01:56:25.590]  The fires of today's trans adults.
[01:56:25.590 --> 01:56:27.590]  Will light the way for tomorrow's.
[01:56:28.590 --> 01:56:29.590]  And it goes on.
[01:56:30.590 --> 01:56:31.590]  So that's it.
[01:56:31.590 --> 01:56:32.590]  They're coming for your children.
[01:56:32.590 --> 01:56:33.590]  In a satanic cult.
[01:56:33.590 --> 01:56:34.590]  And saying it's a satanic cult.
[01:56:34.590 --> 01:56:35.590]  And saying it's a new religion.
[01:56:36.590 --> 01:56:37.590]  This is real folks.
[01:56:37.590 --> 01:56:38.590]  This is happening.
[01:56:38.590 --> 01:56:39.590]  Biggest corporations in the world.
[01:56:39.590 --> 01:56:40.590]  Are at war with us.
[01:56:40.590 --> 01:56:41.590]  And they serve satan.
[01:56:45.590 --> 01:56:46.590]  And we've been warning you.
[01:56:49.590 --> 01:56:50.590]  We've been warning about this.
[01:56:50.590 --> 01:56:51.590]  Preparing for this.
[01:56:51.590 --> 01:56:53.590]  Now the mask is off folks.
[01:56:53.590 --> 01:56:55.590]  The death cult is here.
[01:56:55.590 --> 01:56:56.590]  And you know.
[01:56:57.590 --> 01:56:59.590]  Sadly most people at the bottom of the barrel on this.
[01:56:59.590 --> 01:57:00.590]  Really don't understand.
[01:57:00.590 --> 01:57:02.590]  What they're taking part in.
[01:57:02.590 --> 01:57:04.590]  A gigantic blood sacrifice.
[01:57:04.590 --> 01:57:07.590]  A gigantic satanic ritualistic sacrifice.
[01:57:08.590 --> 01:57:10.590]  Turning children into eunuchs.
[01:57:11.590 --> 01:57:12.590]  Murdering them by the millions.
[01:57:12.590 --> 01:57:13.590]  Calling it health care.
[01:57:14.590 --> 01:57:16.590]  It's a giant satanic death cult folks.
[01:57:16.590 --> 01:57:17.590]  Controls the planet.
[01:57:18.590 --> 01:57:20.590]  And that's why things feel so off.
[01:57:21.590 --> 01:57:23.590]  And things don't seem to make sense.
[01:57:23.590 --> 01:57:25.590]  And people search for justice and truth.
[01:57:26.590 --> 01:57:27.590]  In these times of confusion.
[01:57:27.590 --> 01:57:30.590]  It's a satanic death cult controlled planet.
[01:57:31.590 --> 01:57:32.590]  That we are up against.
[01:57:34.590 --> 01:57:35.590]  And now.
[01:57:35.590 --> 01:57:36.590]  More than ever.
[01:57:37.590 --> 01:57:39.590]  The world is waking up to realize it.
[01:57:40.590 --> 01:57:42.590]  And so it's just getting more aggressive.
[01:57:42.590 --> 01:57:44.590]  In their attacks coming after the youth.

[01:59:53.590 --> 01:59:55.590]  You are the resistance.
[02:00:05.590 --> 02:00:06.590]  I want to talk about.
[02:00:06.590 --> 02:00:10.590]  A headline that was in the news yesterday.
[02:00:10.590 --> 02:00:15.590]  That directly ties in to what we are seeing now.
[02:00:15.590 --> 02:00:17.590]  With this satanic death cult.
[02:00:17.590 --> 02:00:19.590]  Targeting the children.
[02:00:19.590 --> 02:00:22.590]  Using the corporations.
[02:00:22.590 --> 02:00:24.590]  Using the government.
[02:00:24.590 --> 02:00:25.590]  The department of education.
[02:00:25.590 --> 02:00:26.590]  The classroom.
[02:00:26.590 --> 02:00:27.590]  To indoctrinate.
[02:00:27.590 --> 02:00:29.590]  And propagandize children.
[02:00:29.590 --> 02:00:31.590]  Into this satanic death cult.
[02:00:31.590 --> 02:00:32.590]  Yes.
[02:00:32.590 --> 02:00:33.590]  It is the trans kids movement.
[02:00:33.590 --> 02:00:35.590]  Turning children into eunuchs.
[02:00:35.590 --> 02:00:36.590]  Yes.
[02:00:36.590 --> 02:00:38.590]  It is the abortion is healthcare movement.
[02:00:38.590 --> 02:00:40.590]  Murdering children in the womb.
[02:00:40.590 --> 02:00:42.590]  And this was the headline.
[02:00:42.590 --> 02:00:43.590]  From the hill.
[02:00:43.590 --> 02:00:45.590]  Does God exist?
[02:00:45.590 --> 02:00:49.590]  Only half of Americans say a definite yes.
[02:00:49.590 --> 02:00:52.590]  I see it all stems from this folks.
[02:00:52.590 --> 02:00:54.590]  It all stems from this.
[02:00:54.590 --> 02:00:56.590]  And.
[02:00:56.590 --> 02:00:58.590]  To me.
[02:00:58.590 --> 02:00:59.590]  Denying creation.
[02:00:59.590 --> 02:01:02.590]  Is one of the most foolish things.
[02:01:02.590 --> 02:01:03.590]  That you can do.
[02:01:03.590 --> 02:01:04.590]  It is one of the most.
[02:01:04.590 --> 02:01:06.590]  Denial.
[02:01:06.590 --> 02:01:08.590]  Of your own existence.
[02:01:08.590 --> 02:01:10.590]  Things that you could ever do.
[02:01:10.590 --> 02:01:11.590]  Is to deny.
[02:01:12.590 --> 02:01:15.590]  That there is truly a divine power at work.
[02:01:15.590 --> 02:01:18.590]  And there is truly a divine creation.
[02:01:18.590 --> 02:01:20.590]  That we are a part of.
[02:01:20.590 --> 02:01:22.590]  And when you deny that.
[02:01:22.590 --> 02:01:24.590]  You devalue yourself.
[02:01:24.590 --> 02:01:25.590]  And when you deny that.
[02:01:25.590 --> 02:01:26.590]  You devalue life.
[02:01:26.590 --> 02:01:28.590]  And you devalue this experience.
[02:01:28.590 --> 02:01:30.590]  This consciousness.
[02:01:30.590 --> 02:01:32.590]  And a lot of what we're dealing with.
[02:01:32.590 --> 02:01:33.590]  In civilization today.
[02:01:33.590 --> 02:01:34.590]  Is because of that.
[02:01:34.590 --> 02:01:37.590]  Because of that devaluation of human life.
[02:01:37.590 --> 02:01:40.590]  And because of the.
[02:01:40.590 --> 02:01:41.590]  I wouldn't even say devaluation.
[02:01:41.590 --> 02:01:43.590]  There's no value to it at all.
[02:01:43.590 --> 02:01:44.590]  If you deny God.
[02:01:44.590 --> 02:01:45.590]  There's no value.
[02:01:45.590 --> 02:01:47.590]  You have no value in creation at all.
[02:01:47.590 --> 02:01:50.590]  If you deny that it's divine.
[02:01:50.590 --> 02:01:53.590]  And so it all stems from there.
[02:01:53.590 --> 02:01:54.590]  And this is why.
[02:01:54.590 --> 02:01:57.590]  There's all kinds of stories like this.
[02:01:57.590 --> 02:01:59.590]  They don't get consistent.
[02:01:59.590 --> 02:02:00.590]  Coverage.
[02:02:00.590 --> 02:02:01.590]  Living in fear.
[02:02:01.590 --> 02:02:03.590]  Arson is the latest.
[02:02:03.590 --> 02:02:04.590]  In a string of attacks.
[02:02:04.590 --> 02:02:07.590]  On Minnesota mosques.
[02:02:07.590 --> 02:02:09.590]  It's not just mosques getting attacks.
[02:02:09.590 --> 02:02:11.590]  It's not just Jewish synagogues getting attacks.
[02:02:11.590 --> 02:02:13.590]  It's not just Catholic churches.
[02:02:13.590 --> 02:02:15.590]  Or Christian churches getting attacked.
[02:02:15.590 --> 02:02:19.590]  Folks all these religious entities are getting attacked.
[02:02:19.590 --> 02:02:21.590]  All of them are.
[02:02:21.590 --> 02:02:25.590]  And it's really an overall attack on God.
[02:02:25.590 --> 02:02:27.590]  And creation.
[02:02:27.590 --> 02:02:28.590]  And so I noticed.
[02:02:28.590 --> 02:02:29.590]  Again part of this is.
[02:02:29.590 --> 02:02:30.590]  Abortion is healthcare.
[02:02:30.590 --> 02:02:32.590]  That's part of the satanic death cult.
[02:02:32.590 --> 02:02:34.590]  Deception that abortion is healthcare.
[02:02:34.590 --> 02:02:38.590]  And this story went viral.
[02:02:38.590 --> 02:02:40.590]  And there's actually a similar one.
[02:02:40.590 --> 02:02:44.590]  But I'm just going to choose to use this story today as the example.
[02:02:44.590 --> 02:02:46.590]  New Mexico mother.
[02:02:46.590 --> 02:02:47.590]  19 years old.
[02:02:47.590 --> 02:02:51.590]  Admits to tossing newborn baby into hospital trash can.
[02:02:51.590 --> 02:02:54.590]  It came out and I didn't know what to do.
[02:02:54.590 --> 02:02:55.590]  She didn't want it.
[02:02:55.590 --> 02:02:57.590]  So she threw it in the trash.
[02:02:57.590 --> 02:02:58.590]  Now folks.
[02:02:58.590 --> 02:03:02.590]  How does one even get to that point?
[02:03:02.590 --> 02:03:07.590]  It's the devaluation of life.
[02:03:08.590 --> 02:03:12.590]  You have such a low regard for yourself.
[02:03:12.590 --> 02:03:15.590]  And for now the life that you've brought into the world.
[02:03:15.590 --> 02:03:18.590]  That you throw it into a trash bin.
[02:03:18.590 --> 02:03:22.590]  That is heartbreaking.
[02:03:22.590 --> 02:03:25.590]  That is diabolical.
[02:03:25.590 --> 02:03:28.590]  But what's worse.
[02:03:28.590 --> 02:03:32.590]  Has been the response from the American left.
[02:03:32.590 --> 02:03:34.590]  Because they've taken this story.
[02:03:34.590 --> 02:03:36.590]  And they've defended the young women.
[02:03:36.590 --> 02:03:38.590]  And they've taken this story.
[02:03:38.590 --> 02:03:43.590]  Again this is not the only story of a woman tossing her baby into the trash can.
[02:03:43.590 --> 02:03:44.590]  There's other stories.
[02:03:44.590 --> 02:03:46.590]  And so the American left.
[02:03:46.590 --> 02:03:47.590]  The pro-abortion left.
[02:03:47.590 --> 02:03:50.590]  Is taking this story and running with it.
[02:03:50.590 --> 02:03:52.590]  Defending this young girl.
[02:03:52.590 --> 02:03:54.590]  My heart breaks for her.
[02:03:54.590 --> 02:03:56.590]  Just like it breaks for the baby.
[02:03:56.590 --> 02:03:59.590]  But they're defending her.
[02:03:59.590 --> 02:04:01.590]  And they're using it as an excuse.
[02:04:01.590 --> 02:04:03.590]  To legalize abortion.
[02:04:03.590 --> 02:04:06.590]  And they're saying this is what's going to happen.
[02:04:06.590 --> 02:04:08.590]  When you take away our health care.
[02:04:08.590 --> 02:04:09.590]  A.k.a. abortion.
[02:04:09.590 --> 02:04:11.590]  Now ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:11.590 --> 02:04:15.590]  Anybody with any sense at all.
[02:04:15.590 --> 02:04:17.590]  With the ability to use the internet.
[02:04:17.590 --> 02:04:19.590]  Can search.
[02:04:19.590 --> 02:04:23.590]  And find out that abortion is not illegal in New Mexico.
[02:04:23.590 --> 02:04:26.590]  You can have an abortion in New Mexico.
[02:04:26.590 --> 02:04:27.590]  There were no laws.
[02:04:27.590 --> 02:04:31.590]  In New Mexico that stopped her from getting abortion.
[02:04:31.590 --> 02:04:32.590]  Now there might be someday.
[02:04:32.590 --> 02:04:33.590]  But there weren't.
[02:04:33.590 --> 02:04:35.590]  So they defended this girl.
[02:04:35.590 --> 02:04:36.590]  Saying hey.
[02:04:36.590 --> 02:04:38.590]  She threw her baby in a trash can.
[02:04:38.590 --> 02:04:40.590]  Because you wouldn't let her have an abortion.
[02:04:40.590 --> 02:04:42.590]  That's not even accurate.
[02:04:42.590 --> 02:04:45.590]  And the fact that you race to attack people.
[02:04:45.590 --> 02:04:47.590]  That want to stop baby murder.
[02:04:47.590 --> 02:04:48.590]  Instead of saying gee.
[02:04:48.590 --> 02:04:50.590]  Tossing your baby in a trash can is diabolical.
[02:04:50.590 --> 02:04:51.590]  We shouldn't do that.
[02:04:51.590 --> 02:04:54.590]  Shows you how far down this death cult.
[02:04:54.590 --> 02:04:56.590]  The American left has truly fallen.
[02:04:58.590 --> 02:04:59.590]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:59.590 --> 02:05:00.590]  The truth.
[02:05:00.590 --> 02:05:03.590]  The solution is laying right there in front of you.
[02:05:03.590 --> 02:05:04.590]  Hidden in plain view.
[02:05:04.590 --> 02:05:07.590]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[02:05:07.590 --> 02:05:09.590]  If you go to Wikipedia.
[02:05:09.590 --> 02:05:11.590]  It has links to the UN's own website.
[02:05:11.590 --> 02:05:14.590]  Where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability.
[02:05:14.590 --> 02:05:17.590]  In the world is iodine deficiency.
[02:05:17.590 --> 02:05:21.590]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability.
[02:05:21.590 --> 02:05:25.590]  Is lack of real pure iodine in the body.
[02:05:25.590 --> 02:05:27.590]  As they bomb us with the bad halogens.
[02:05:27.590 --> 02:05:29.590]  Bromine, bromide, chlorine.
[02:05:29.590 --> 02:05:30.590]  And so much more.
[02:05:30.590 --> 02:05:32.590]  Upwards of 2 billion people.
[02:05:32.590 --> 02:05:34.590]  In a Lancet medical journal study.
[02:05:34.590 --> 02:05:36.590]  In 2007.
[02:05:36.590 --> 02:05:38.590]  Worldwide have cognitive disabilities.
[02:05:38.590 --> 02:05:40.590]  Because they don't have high quality iodine.
[02:05:40.590 --> 02:05:42.590]  Most iodine is bound to other elements.
[02:05:42.590 --> 02:05:43.590]  You don't absorb it.
[02:05:43.590 --> 02:05:44.590]  We have X3.
[02:05:44.590 --> 02:05:45.590]  All three types of good iodine.
[02:05:45.590 --> 02:05:46.590]  Together.
[02:05:46.590 --> 02:05:48.590]  That super charges your body.
[02:05:48.590 --> 02:05:50.590]  X3 is now back in stock.
[02:05:50.590 --> 02:05:51.590]  At Infowarsstore.com.
[02:05:51.590 --> 02:05:53.590]  It's been sold out for over 6 months.

[02:05:54.590 --> 02:05:55.590]  X3.
[02:05:55.590 --> 02:05:56.590]  Back in stock.

[02:06:04.590 --> 02:06:06.590]  It's Owen Troyer.
[02:06:06.590 --> 02:06:10.590]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:21.590 --> 02:06:23.590]  We're now joined by Pastor Dave Scarlett.
[02:06:23.590 --> 02:06:25.590]  Of His Glory TV.
[02:06:25.590 --> 02:06:27.590]  At His Glory Me.
[02:06:27.590 --> 02:06:28.590]  On Twitter.
[02:06:28.590 --> 02:06:29.590]  On YouTube.
[02:06:29.590 --> 02:06:31.590]  His Glory TV.
[02:06:31.590 --> 02:06:34.590]  They've got a big movie production coming out.
[02:06:34.590 --> 02:06:36.590]  We're going to be talking about.
[02:06:36.590 --> 02:06:38.590]  But Pastor Dave.
[02:06:38.590 --> 02:06:40.590]  I want to start off on topic.
[02:06:40.590 --> 02:06:42.590]  Of what we've been covering here.
[02:06:42.590 --> 02:06:44.590]  And we just see this everywhere.
[02:06:44.590 --> 02:06:46.590]  From the trans kids surgeries.
[02:06:46.590 --> 02:06:47.590]  That they promote.
[02:06:47.590 --> 02:06:49.590]  The genital mutilation of children.
[02:06:49.590 --> 02:06:52.590]  To the gay pride parades.
[02:06:52.590 --> 02:06:55.590]  Becoming just sexual debauchery.
[02:06:56.590 --> 02:06:58.590]  Exercises for sexual degenerates.
[02:06:58.590 --> 02:07:00.590]  Aimed at children.
[02:07:00.590 --> 02:07:03.590]  To the abortion as healthcare argument.
[02:07:03.590 --> 02:07:06.590]  And then defending a girl that throws her newborn baby in the trash can.
[02:07:06.590 --> 02:07:08.590]  Claiming she couldn't have had an abortion.
[02:07:08.590 --> 02:07:10.590]  When she could have.
[02:07:10.590 --> 02:07:12.590]  When you see all this stuff.
[02:07:12.590 --> 02:07:14.590]  Do you see this as a sign.
[02:07:14.590 --> 02:07:17.590]  That the satanic movement.
[02:07:17.590 --> 02:07:19.590]  Is actually desperate right now.
[02:07:19.590 --> 02:07:20.590]  And maybe flailing.
[02:07:20.590 --> 02:07:23.590]  Because they're losing their position.
[02:07:23.590 --> 02:07:24.590]  Or do you see this as.
[02:07:24.590 --> 02:07:26.590]  It's more aggressive than ever.
[02:07:26.590 --> 02:07:28.590]  It's feeling more empowered than ever.
[02:07:28.590 --> 02:07:30.590]  And that's why it's louder than ever.
[02:07:30.590 --> 02:07:32.590]  Pastor Dave Scarlett.
[02:07:32.590 --> 02:07:33.590]  Oh and hey.
[02:07:33.590 --> 02:07:34.590]  First of all.
[02:07:34.590 --> 02:07:35.590]  Thank you for having me on again.
[02:07:35.590 --> 02:07:36.590]  It's great to see you.
[02:07:36.590 --> 02:07:39.590]  I think the point you just made is spot on.
[02:07:39.590 --> 02:07:43.590]  Evil knows that the light of Christ is coming.
[02:07:43.590 --> 02:07:45.590]  And they're frantic.
[02:07:45.590 --> 02:07:46.590]  They're in a panic mode.
[02:07:46.590 --> 02:07:48.590]  So they're coming out with everything they got.
[02:07:48.590 --> 02:07:50.590]  To stop this great revival.
[02:07:50.590 --> 02:07:52.590]  You and I have talked before about this revival.
[02:07:52.590 --> 02:07:54.590]  That will come through the kids.
[02:07:54.590 --> 02:07:55.590]  The children.
[02:07:55.590 --> 02:07:56.590]  The younger generation.
[02:07:56.590 --> 02:07:58.590]  That is the furthest from the Lord right now.
[02:07:58.590 --> 02:08:00.590]  That's the Joel 2 movement.
[02:08:00.590 --> 02:08:01.590]  Even though it looks dark.
[02:08:01.590 --> 02:08:03.590]  And we're in a Sodom and Gomorrah type of moment.
[02:08:03.590 --> 02:08:05.590]  We're on a tipping point for the Lord.
[02:08:05.590 --> 02:08:08.590]  To show his glory.
[02:08:08.590 --> 02:08:09.590]  And his mercy.
[02:08:09.590 --> 02:08:11.590]  And you're going to see these prodigals return.
[02:08:11.590 --> 02:08:12.590]  I have no doubt about it.
[02:08:12.590 --> 02:08:14.590]  But we have to lean in.
[02:08:14.590 --> 02:08:15.590]  We have to pray.
[02:08:15.590 --> 02:08:16.590]  And more than just pray.
[02:08:16.590 --> 02:08:17.590]  We have to take actions.
[02:08:17.590 --> 02:08:19.590]  As believers in Jesus Christ.
[02:08:20.590 --> 02:08:22.590]  I'm seeing the awakening.
[02:08:22.590 --> 02:08:23.590]  I mean there's no doubt.
[02:08:23.590 --> 02:08:25.590]  People are having this understanding.
[02:08:25.590 --> 02:08:28.590]  At least of the evil that is present in front of them.
[02:08:28.590 --> 02:08:30.590]  And I think there's a natural human response.
[02:08:30.590 --> 02:08:31.590]  That's built into us.
[02:08:31.590 --> 02:08:33.590]  To want to be good again.
[02:08:33.590 --> 02:08:36.590]  You know even if you're not necessarily a bad person.
[02:08:36.590 --> 02:08:39.590]  You've just kind of maybe lost sight of your moral compass.
[02:08:39.590 --> 02:08:41.590]  Or maybe you've lost sight of your values.
[02:08:41.590 --> 02:08:42.590]  Or your principles.
[02:08:42.590 --> 02:08:44.590]  But now it's like we see this evil encroaching.
[02:08:44.590 --> 02:08:46.590]  And I think naturally the response from people is.
[02:08:46.590 --> 02:08:48.590]  Wow I need to be a better person.
[02:08:48.590 --> 02:08:50.590]  I don't want to fall into this.
[02:08:52.590 --> 02:08:53.590]  Yeah you're exactly right.
[02:08:53.590 --> 02:08:55.590]  I've talked to people that have.
[02:08:55.590 --> 02:08:56.590]  They're atheists.
[02:08:56.590 --> 02:08:57.590]  They're agnostics.
[02:08:57.590 --> 02:09:00.590]  They're like this immorality is gone.
[02:09:00.590 --> 02:09:02.590]  And they have no belief system.
[02:09:02.590 --> 02:09:07.590]  So it's even shocking for people who are not following a particular religion.
[02:09:07.590 --> 02:09:09.590]  This is a wake up call for not only America.
[02:09:09.590 --> 02:09:10.590]  But for the world.
[02:09:10.590 --> 02:09:12.590]  This is a Sodom and Gomorrah moment.
[02:09:12.590 --> 02:09:14.590]  And I really believe that we're sitting on the precipice.
[02:09:14.590 --> 02:09:17.590]  Of the greatest revival in the history of the world.
[02:09:17.590 --> 02:09:20.590]  It does feel like it's starting to boil over.
[02:09:20.590 --> 02:09:27.590]  And really the political aspect of it to me is important.
[02:09:27.590 --> 02:09:30.590]  Simply because I think that everything.
[02:09:30.590 --> 02:09:35.590]  We always hear that culture or politics streams down from culture.
[02:09:35.590 --> 02:09:36.590]  Basically culture and then to politics.
[02:09:36.590 --> 02:09:39.590]  I've actually decided I disagree with that.
[02:09:39.590 --> 02:09:43.590]  I actually think that politics has been steering culture for far too long.
[02:09:43.590 --> 02:09:45.590]  And this assumption that we have.
[02:09:45.590 --> 02:09:47.590]  That hey if we change the culture we can change the politics.
[02:09:47.590 --> 02:09:52.590]  No I actually think most of the problems we have are stemming from our corrupt politics.
[02:09:52.590 --> 02:09:55.590]  I think our government has gotten so evil.
[02:09:55.590 --> 02:09:59.590]  And all the attachments now that are working with it.
[02:09:59.590 --> 02:10:06.590]  Corporations, NGOs, all these 501c3s, even churches now.
[02:10:06.590 --> 02:10:09.590]  All these different institutions that are working with the government.
[02:10:09.590 --> 02:10:11.590]  To me they're the ones controlling culture.
[02:10:11.590 --> 02:10:13.590]  I don't see culture controlling politics.
[02:10:13.590 --> 02:10:14.590]  I completely disagree with that.
[02:10:14.590 --> 02:10:16.590]  I think we have to clean up our politics.
[02:10:16.590 --> 02:10:18.590]  I think we have to get the rot gut out of our government.
[02:10:18.590 --> 02:10:22.590]  And then maybe we can take the culture and the politics back.
[02:10:22.590 --> 02:10:29.590]  But I don't really see the cultural revolution really winning until we correct the political issues.
[02:10:29.590 --> 02:10:30.590]  Do you agree?
[02:10:30.590 --> 02:10:31.590]  I agree with you.
[02:10:31.590 --> 02:10:35.590]  American people are realizing whether you're left or right or center.
[02:10:35.590 --> 02:10:37.590]  That we can't trust our own government.
[02:10:37.590 --> 02:10:40.590]  That's something that Alex has been saying for years.
[02:10:40.590 --> 02:10:42.590]  And he's been absolutely right.
[02:10:42.590 --> 02:10:47.590]  And now we're getting them, the three-letter agencies admitting themselves how bad this is.
[02:10:47.590 --> 02:10:50.590]  This Durham report has put it over the top.
[02:10:50.590 --> 02:10:52.590]  And you're seeing people from the left.
[02:10:52.590 --> 02:10:53.590]  You're seeing people from the center.
[02:10:53.590 --> 02:10:57.590]  You're seeing people from the right saying our government is out of control.
[02:10:57.590 --> 02:10:59.590]  And we need to get it back.
[02:10:59.590 --> 02:11:00.590]  We need to get morality back.
[02:11:00.590 --> 02:11:04.590]  And we need to change our government as it stands today.
[02:11:04.590 --> 02:11:10.590]  Well, and you just look at how corrupt it is.
[02:11:10.590 --> 02:11:11.590]  There's no denying it.
[02:11:11.590 --> 02:11:13.590]  I mean, they can try to cover it up in the media.
[02:11:13.590 --> 02:11:19.590]  But what I've noticed, I don't know if you've noticed this too, is I talk to average people.
[02:11:19.590 --> 02:11:23.590]  I don't know, left, right, center, indifferent mostly, I would say, indifferent.
[02:11:23.590 --> 02:11:27.590]  And they understand, wow, you know, I've always known the government was corrupt.
[02:11:27.590 --> 02:11:30.590]  But I thought I could live my life and not have it affect me.
[02:11:30.590 --> 02:11:31.590]  Not anymore.
[02:11:31.590 --> 02:11:33.590]  They know that this is really affecting them.
[02:11:33.590 --> 02:11:37.590]  Whether it's their bottom line with their energy bills, the price at the pump.
[02:11:37.590 --> 02:11:42.590]  Whether it's they send their kid to the school and they bring back a textbook that has pornographic imagery.
[02:11:42.590 --> 02:11:45.590]  I mean, they're seeing it everywhere and they're realizing, wait a second, no, no, no, no.
[02:11:45.590 --> 02:11:46.590]  I can't avoid this now.
[02:11:46.590 --> 02:11:48.590]  This is encroaching in my daily life.
[02:11:48.590 --> 02:11:50.590]  This is encroaching in my children's lives.
[02:11:50.590 --> 02:11:54.590]  If I don't do something about it now, it's going to be worse for future generations.
[02:11:54.590 --> 02:11:56.590]  You're absolutely right.
[02:11:56.590 --> 02:11:57.590]  I mean, it hits everywhere.
[02:11:57.590 --> 02:12:02.590]  It hits the public schools, as you said, that they're out of control with the curriculum that they put into our kids,
[02:12:02.590 --> 02:12:05.590]  teaching our kids, having these drag shows.
[02:12:05.590 --> 02:12:10.590]  FBI overreaching into churches and Catholic churches and that.
[02:12:10.590 --> 02:12:14.590]  And also MRNA into our cattle and our food system.
[02:12:14.590 --> 02:12:17.590]  Americans are saying no more.
[02:12:17.590 --> 02:12:21.590]  We, the people, have to stand up for our constitutional rights and say, you know what?
[02:12:21.590 --> 02:12:23.590]  They're beyond overreach.
[02:12:23.590 --> 02:12:26.590]  This is an invasion of our own government.
[02:12:26.590 --> 02:12:31.590]  You know, you just brought up the targeting of churches by the FBI.
[02:12:31.590 --> 02:12:34.590]  And, you know, I'm actually stunned.
[02:12:34.590 --> 02:12:37.590]  I'm actually stunned that there has been no response.
[02:12:37.590 --> 02:12:41.590]  I've seen no response unified from the Catholic community.
[02:12:41.590 --> 02:12:45.590]  I've seen no unified response from the Christian community.
[02:12:45.590 --> 02:12:48.590]  Why do you suppose that is?
[02:12:48.590 --> 02:12:49.590]  They're afraid.
[02:12:49.590 --> 02:12:52.590]  They're afraid that if they stand up, they're going to be next.
[02:12:52.590 --> 02:12:55.590]  And, you know, it's the same thing with January 6th.
[02:12:55.590 --> 02:12:59.590]  We need a remnant of people that are not afraid to go to prison ministry.
[02:12:59.590 --> 02:13:01.590]  And that's to do it for the Lord and stand up for truth.
[02:13:01.590 --> 02:13:05.590]  Because if we don't stand up, this nation as we know it is gone.
[02:13:05.590 --> 02:13:07.590]  And it's happening inside the Catholic church.
[02:13:07.590 --> 02:13:09.590]  It was at our tent revival in Texas.
[02:13:09.590 --> 02:13:15.590]  We had the three-letter organization in the crowd trying to infiltrate our tent revival.
[02:13:15.590 --> 02:13:19.590]  And we just waved and we prayed for them and said, if you want prayer, come on up and we'll pray over you.
[02:13:19.590 --> 02:13:24.590]  That's an interesting term, prison ministry or prison revival.
[02:13:24.590 --> 02:13:26.590]  And I'd like you to expand on that.
[02:13:26.590 --> 02:13:30.590]  And, look, I'm not going to sit here and act like I like going to jail or anything like that.
[02:13:30.590 --> 02:13:32.590]  But, I mean, I get what you're saying.
[02:13:32.590 --> 02:13:35.590]  I stood right in the Capitol knowing I was going to be arrested.
[02:13:35.590 --> 02:13:37.590]  And I thought to myself, you know what?
[02:13:37.590 --> 02:13:41.590]  If I have to spend a night or two in jail to stand up for free speech, then to me that's worth it.
[02:13:41.590 --> 02:13:42.590]  That's a political issue.
[02:13:42.590 --> 02:13:45.590]  We're now talking about, hey, where are Christians?
[02:13:45.590 --> 02:13:49.590]  Where are Catholics saying we're being wrongly persecuted by the FBI here?
[02:13:49.590 --> 02:13:50.590]  They should be standing up.
[02:13:50.590 --> 02:13:53.590]  Explain what you mean when you say prison ministry.
[02:13:53.590 --> 02:13:56.590]  Prison ministry means that you're going to put it all on the line.
[02:13:56.590 --> 02:13:57.590]  You're not worried about your tithing.
[02:13:57.590 --> 02:13:59.590]  You're not worried about your 501C3 status.
[02:13:59.590 --> 02:14:05.590]  You're not worried about your image or your congregation not coming anymore for popular.
[02:14:05.590 --> 02:14:10.590]  You're standing up for the truth, the truth of the Constitution, the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[02:14:10.590 --> 02:14:16.590]  And that means putting it all on the line that if you have to go into prison like the Apostle Paul does,
[02:14:16.590 --> 02:14:19.590]  we sing hymns and praise and we do prison ministry.
[02:14:19.590 --> 02:14:23.590]  We start praising and praising him in prison.
[02:14:23.590 --> 02:14:27.590]  I mean, if it's good enough for the Apostle Paul, why isn't it good enough for us today?
[02:14:27.590 --> 02:14:29.590]  We can't be afraid of that.
[02:14:29.590 --> 02:14:30.590]  Yeah, and it is.
[02:14:30.590 --> 02:14:32.590]  It really is that fear.
[02:14:32.590 --> 02:14:39.590]  And I think that that's kind of the major tool, if you will, that the far left is using.
[02:14:39.590 --> 02:14:40.590]  They want you to be afraid.
[02:14:40.590 --> 02:14:42.590]  They want you to be afraid to tell the truth.
[02:14:42.590 --> 02:14:45.590]  They want you to be afraid to say there's only two genders.
[02:14:45.590 --> 02:14:50.590]  They want you to be afraid to say Trump didn't collude with Russia or whatever other propaganda they're trying to sell you.
[02:14:50.590 --> 02:14:56.590]  How do you try to convince people that, hey, you've got to get over this fear?
[02:14:56.590 --> 02:14:59.590]  Well, you just have to go back to the scriptures.
[02:14:59.590 --> 02:15:01.590]  Jesus never wants us, he tells us to fear.
[02:15:01.590 --> 02:15:03.590]  The only fear there is, is fear of the Lord.
[02:15:03.590 --> 02:15:07.590]  And that fear of the Lord means that we are not obeying his precepts and commandments.
[02:15:07.590 --> 02:15:12.590]  And the only fear I have of the Lord is I'm not doing what he wants me to do for his will.
[02:15:12.590 --> 02:15:14.590]  But other than that, he says, I got it.
[02:15:14.590 --> 02:15:17.590]  Trust in me and you'll have the shalom and peace.
[02:15:17.590 --> 02:15:21.590]  And when you trust in him with all things, you have a peace that the world can't understand.
[02:15:21.590 --> 02:15:23.590]  And you're not going to quit because our home is on high.
[02:15:23.590 --> 02:15:26.590]  This is just boot camp for eternal life.
[02:15:26.590 --> 02:15:31.590]  Pastor Dave Scarlett is my guest, HisGloryTV at HisGlory.me.
[02:15:31.590 --> 02:15:35.590]  Now, they've come out with a new film from His Glory Ministries.
[02:15:35.590 --> 02:15:39.590]  And I want Pastor Dave to tell us about that on the other side.
[02:15:39.590 --> 02:15:46.590]  And we're going to show you a little premiere of the trailer right here on The Alex Jones Show as well.
[02:15:46.590 --> 02:15:48.590]  So don't go anywhere, folks.
[02:15:48.590 --> 02:15:52.590]  It is The Alex Jones Show at band.video, Infowars.com, slash show.
[02:15:52.590 --> 02:15:55.590]  Brought to you by InfowarsStore.com.
[02:15:57.590 --> 02:16:03.590]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[02:16:03.590 --> 02:16:06.590]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[02:16:06.590 --> 02:16:08.590]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[02:16:08.590 --> 02:16:11.590]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[02:16:11.590 --> 02:16:14.590]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[02:16:14.590 --> 02:16:16.590]  It's the same thing with Infowars.
[02:16:16.590 --> 02:16:22.590]  But Infowars is not owned by Fox or controlled by George Soros or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[02:16:22.590 --> 02:16:26.590]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[02:16:26.590 --> 02:16:28.590]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[02:16:28.590 --> 02:16:33.590]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[02:16:33.590 --> 02:16:36.590]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[02:16:36.590 --> 02:16:40.590]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand.
[02:16:40.590 --> 02:16:42.590]  Please don't take Infowars for granted.
[02:16:42.590 --> 02:16:44.590]  We're barely hanging on.
[02:16:44.590 --> 02:16:49.590]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support while getting great products at the same time at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:16:49.590 --> 02:16:51.590]  So don't procrastinate.
[02:16:51.590 --> 02:16:52.590]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[02:16:52.590 --> 02:16:56.590]  Get amazing products that keep us on the air and never submit to these tyrants.
[02:16:56.590 --> 02:17:02.590]  Every time I talk to you, you're either like on the border exposing the cartels and like coming under fire.
[02:17:02.590 --> 02:17:06.590]  Or you're on the streets of some American city hanging out with drug addicts and criminals.
[02:17:06.590 --> 02:17:09.590]  And now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill.
[02:17:09.590 --> 02:17:11.590]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah?
[02:17:11.590 --> 02:17:13.590]  Have you ever considered that for a second?
[02:17:13.590 --> 02:17:16.590]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans.
[02:17:16.590 --> 02:17:18.590]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth.
[02:17:18.590 --> 02:17:20.590]  And again, you know, I have Infowars to thank for that.
[02:17:20.590 --> 02:17:24.590]  Looking back on the day I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions.
[02:17:24.590 --> 02:17:30.590]  I was so grateful because, you know, I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and under the Infowars team.
[02:17:30.590 --> 02:17:35.590]  And I really do credit that as to why I'm able to, you know, get these types of clips.
[02:17:35.590 --> 02:17:39.590]  Because Alex's whole mentality was, you know, go where the story is.
[02:17:39.590 --> 02:17:42.590]  Go where the mainstream media refuses to.
[02:17:42.590 --> 02:17:44.590]  So it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity.
[02:17:44.590 --> 02:17:47.590]  I'm just addicted to telling the truth and helping the American people.
[02:17:47.590 --> 02:17:52.590]  And I really do credit Alex for, you know, really instilling that within me early on in my career.
[02:17:57.590 --> 02:18:00.590]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and War for the World,
[02:18:00.590 --> 02:18:05.590]  is a historic book that documents the globalists in their own words, plan for our future.
[02:18:05.590 --> 02:18:06.590]  That is a hellish future.
[02:18:06.590 --> 02:18:10.590]  Now, you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[02:18:10.590 --> 02:18:16.590]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and War for the World at bookstores, Amazon or Infowars.com.
[02:18:16.590 --> 02:18:22.590]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[02:18:22.590 --> 02:18:24.590]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[02:18:24.590 --> 02:18:29.590]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy at Infowars.com.
[02:18:29.590 --> 02:18:33.590]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[02:18:33.590 --> 02:18:36.590]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book.
[02:18:36.590 --> 02:18:39.590]  You'll also know that you help keep Infowars on the air.
[02:18:39.590 --> 02:18:43.590]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies.
[02:18:43.590 --> 02:18:48.590]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowars.com and get a signed copy
[02:18:48.590 --> 02:18:53.590]  and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate to the library or get them to the local school.
[02:18:53.590 --> 02:18:56.590]  This is an Infowar. I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[02:18:56.590 --> 02:19:03.590]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[02:19:03.590 --> 02:19:06.590]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[02:19:06.590 --> 02:19:11.590]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers
[02:19:11.590 --> 02:19:17.590]  to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid, still highly toxic but containable.
[02:19:17.590 --> 02:19:23.590]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison and there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[02:19:23.590 --> 02:19:28.590]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury
[02:19:28.590 --> 02:19:31.590]  who was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[02:19:31.590 --> 02:19:38.590]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product
[02:19:38.590 --> 02:19:40.590]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[02:19:40.590 --> 02:19:45.590]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[02:19:45.590 --> 02:19:51.590]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water and a remedy to this madness.
[02:19:52.590 --> 02:19:55.590]  Available now at InfowarStore.com
[02:19:59.590 --> 02:20:05.590]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:07.300 --> 02:20:26.580]  Pastor Dave Scarlett is our guest.
[02:20:26.580 --> 02:20:29.740]  HisGloryTV, HisGlory.me is the website.
[02:20:29.740 --> 02:20:32.980]  Now Pastor Dave, I know that you guys have a new film coming out.
[02:20:33.460 --> 02:20:39.220]  Why don't you tell us about this film, and then you can pitch to the trailer, and we'll
[02:20:39.220 --> 02:20:41.060]  go ahead and air that trailer too.
[02:20:41.060 --> 02:20:43.699]  Yeah, this is, it's called Holy Land.
[02:20:43.699 --> 02:20:46.380]  This was one of our trips to Israel in November.
[02:20:46.380 --> 02:20:51.779]  This is done, narrated, and produced by Mickey Willis, and it gives you a capture of the nation
[02:20:51.779 --> 02:20:56.619]  of Israel, the miracles of Israel, but also biblical Israel, and how important it is for
[02:20:56.619 --> 02:21:01.140]  us to know the historical and the biblical parts of Israel.
[02:21:01.140 --> 02:21:05.539]  Once you go to Israel, your life completely changes, and to be baptized in the Jordan,
[02:21:05.539 --> 02:21:10.179]  there's nothing like it, to walk the places where Jesus walked, to walk the places where
[02:21:10.179 --> 02:21:13.259]  King David walked, it makes the Bible come alive.
[02:21:13.259 --> 02:21:17.460]  We take three trips a year to Israel, and every single person that goes with us comes
[02:21:17.460 --> 02:21:23.259]  back and says that their walk with the Most High is so much significantly better because
[02:21:23.259 --> 02:21:25.500]  their Bible comes alive.
[02:21:25.500 --> 02:21:30.300]  So let's go ahead and see the premiere of the new film, brought to you by HisGloryTV.
[02:21:41.340 --> 02:21:46.300]  It's a miracle that Israel is still in existence in this part of the world.
[02:21:55.500 --> 02:22:03.060]  It's a very, very tough neighborhood.
[02:22:03.060 --> 02:22:08.220]  Pick up your Bible, come to Israel, see these places that Jesus walked and King David walked.
[02:22:08.220 --> 02:22:10.340]  It'll change your life forever.
[02:22:10.340 --> 02:22:18.619]  It'll make the Bible come alive for you, and it's going to get you stronger in your faith.
[02:22:25.500 --> 02:22:36.099]  We have to support the nation of Israel, biblical Israel.
[02:22:36.099 --> 02:22:39.779]  And so there are the future tour dates for this year.
[02:22:39.779 --> 02:22:43.660]  So Pastor Dave, what was the motivating factor for this film for you?
[02:22:43.660 --> 02:22:50.019]  Well, it was with all the world events and how close we are to Matthew 24, that was the
[02:22:50.019 --> 02:22:51.380]  theme of that.
[02:22:51.380 --> 02:22:56.019]  So Mickey Willis and I decided the timing is perfect with what people have gone through
[02:22:56.019 --> 02:23:00.500]  the last three years to see that we really are close to the end days.
[02:23:00.500 --> 02:23:06.099]  We are in the end days, and how to bring the nation of Israel and all the prophecies alive.
[02:23:06.099 --> 02:23:08.099]  And that's exactly what we did in this film.
[02:23:08.099 --> 02:23:13.420]  I'm the co-chairman of the board of Newsreel, so I have contacts with high-ranking generals
[02:23:13.420 --> 02:23:14.939]  in Israel.
[02:23:14.939 --> 02:23:20.340]  And in this movie, you're going to see conversations with generals in Israel about what they have
[02:23:20.340 --> 02:23:24.859]  to deal with every day, and how the Bible is coming alive, how the prophecies of Ezekiel
[02:23:24.859 --> 02:23:30.740]  and Jeremiah and much more and Matthew 24 of Christ are literally being fulfilled right
[02:23:30.740 --> 02:23:32.420]  before our very eyes.
[02:23:32.420 --> 02:23:35.660]  And it gives you a spirit of hope, not fear.
[02:23:35.660 --> 02:23:40.779]  Because we knew, we know, that the Bible tells us these events would happen, they're happening,
[02:23:40.779 --> 02:23:46.699]  and we should fear not, but get in His glory and do things for His purpose, because you
[02:23:46.699 --> 02:23:52.740]  don't want to have tears of regret by not leaving it all on the field for Him.
[02:23:52.740 --> 02:23:59.420]  You know, I also, you know, people notice how crazy the world is getting, and people
[02:23:59.420 --> 02:24:02.539]  can look at the Bible and say, this is prophecy.
[02:24:02.539 --> 02:24:06.080]  I mean, there's no doubt, whether you think the people that think they own this planet
[02:24:06.080 --> 02:24:11.759]  or run this planet are just trying to fulfill the prophecy themselves, or if this is just,
[02:24:11.759 --> 02:24:15.779]  it was always going to be this way, there's no doubt that that's what's going on.
[02:24:15.859 --> 02:24:21.580]  You know, do people come to you, because you bring up the words fear and hope, do people
[02:24:21.580 --> 02:24:24.420]  come to you in fear when they see what's going on, ever?
[02:24:24.420 --> 02:24:26.340]  Do you witness this?
[02:24:26.340 --> 02:24:31.980]  Yes, I witness this everywhere I go across the country, but the more they tune in, the
[02:24:31.980 --> 02:24:34.500]  more they see that we're not fearful.
[02:24:34.500 --> 02:24:38.340]  We embrace what's happening, we believe it's the greatest time in the history of the world
[02:24:38.340 --> 02:24:42.259]  to witness, to bring people to Christ, and that's what it's all about.
[02:24:42.259 --> 02:24:45.259]  Have that shalom that can only come from Him.
[02:24:45.259 --> 02:24:47.740]  You know, we get asked that question all the time.
[02:24:47.740 --> 02:24:52.980]  When the world's melting down, you don't seem like you're ever fearful, or panic, or frantic.
[02:24:52.980 --> 02:24:57.580]  It's because we have the love of the Most High Christ in us, and He's got it, He's won.
[02:24:57.580 --> 02:25:03.060]  He just wants us to participate in these end-time events to bring people in for His purpose
[02:25:03.060 --> 02:25:04.980]  and His glory.
[02:25:04.980 --> 02:25:09.439]  What types of people, you brought up some of the generals in Israel, what other types of
[02:25:09.439 --> 02:25:15.179]  people have you met along the way in your journey that have really impacted and shaped
[02:25:15.179 --> 02:25:17.500]  your worldview?
[02:25:17.500 --> 02:25:24.820]  We've met with many ambassadors of the Israeli government, leaders of the Israeli parliament,
[02:25:24.820 --> 02:25:30.660]  the Knesset, also doctors, Israeli doctors and scientists.
[02:25:30.660 --> 02:25:34.900]  Many of them are asking the questions around, which was never heard of before, they're asking
[02:25:34.900 --> 02:25:38.900]  the questions about, tell me more about this Messiah.
[02:25:38.900 --> 02:25:43.900]  I have seen more people of the Jewish faith come to Christ in the last one year or two
[02:25:43.900 --> 02:25:46.539]  years than in my entire lifetime.
[02:25:46.539 --> 02:25:50.460]  They're asking questions, they know that the world is in a meltdown, and they know there's
[02:25:50.460 --> 02:25:52.380]  a higher purpose.
[02:25:52.380 --> 02:25:56.660]  So they're asking questions, especially around Matthew 24, they see the scripture, they see
[02:25:56.660 --> 02:26:01.340]  the book of Revelation, and they say, this beast system is already here, tell us more
[02:26:01.340 --> 02:26:05.300]  about this Messiah, and they're giving their life to Messiah.
[02:26:05.300 --> 02:26:13.699]  You know, one thing that always makes me hopeful too, we met maybe summer 2020 or 2021, I don't
[02:26:13.699 --> 02:26:15.939]  know if you remember the exact date, do you remember when it was we met?
[02:26:15.939 --> 02:26:17.740]  I know it was in Dallas.
[02:26:17.740 --> 02:26:19.179]  It was in Dallas, yeah.
[02:26:19.179 --> 02:26:24.599]  I think it was summer 21, if I'm not mistaken, it was the Reawaken America tour in Dallas
[02:26:24.599 --> 02:26:26.220]  and we met.
[02:26:26.220 --> 02:26:30.939]  And it was the first time I'd met you, it was the first time I'd seen the great production
[02:26:30.939 --> 02:26:34.259]  work that you do and learned all about it, we did an interview.
[02:26:34.259 --> 02:26:40.900]  And so one thing that always gets me hopeful is watching the progress of independent media,
[02:26:40.900 --> 02:26:44.140]  alternative media, Christian media.
[02:26:44.140 --> 02:26:47.820]  And so I'm looking at your studio, it looks like maybe you've got some new studio digs
[02:26:47.820 --> 02:26:48.820]  there.
[02:26:48.820 --> 02:26:53.580]  Because to me, this is a success story, when independent media, especially in this age
[02:26:53.580 --> 02:26:58.380]  of chilling free speech, censoring free speech, trying to get rid of the First Amendment,
[02:26:58.380 --> 02:27:03.800]  to watch independent media, Christian media flourish and prosper, to me gives hope.
[02:27:03.800 --> 02:27:05.779]  Is that a success story for you?
[02:27:05.779 --> 02:27:07.240]  Amen, it is.
[02:27:07.240 --> 02:27:11.560]  We have a facility in Ohio and when I was with you, and I think it was in January in
[02:27:11.560 --> 02:27:16.199]  your studio, I told you we're coming to Texas and that's where I am now, we're in Texas.
[02:27:16.199 --> 02:27:20.560]  We're in the process of building a 12,000 square foot facility here in Texas that will
[02:27:20.560 --> 02:27:27.119]  be all videos, it will be 24-7 TV, we'll be doing more movies, and also we'll have
[02:27:27.119 --> 02:27:33.080]  our own His Glory music label, so we'll be recording music here in Texas as well.
[02:27:33.519 --> 02:27:37.480]  Yeah, so that was in late 2021 when you and I met.
[02:27:37.480 --> 02:27:39.400]  Man, time just flies.
[02:27:39.400 --> 02:27:46.240]  And again, because we tend to, people tend to lose hope and it's understandable why.
[02:27:46.240 --> 02:27:49.560]  You know, I've been on the receiving end of censorship, I'm very grateful that we have
[02:27:49.560 --> 02:27:55.000]  Banned Out Video and Infowars.com and a great audience here, but to me, to see independent
[02:27:55.000 --> 02:28:02.960]  media getting bigger, even in this age of censorship, is a success story in and of itself.
[02:28:03.840 --> 02:28:06.640]  How much of what you do has to be independently funded?
[02:28:06.640 --> 02:28:09.080]  How much access are you able to get to social media?
[02:28:09.080 --> 02:28:11.080]  Has that affected you at all?
[02:28:11.080 --> 02:28:12.080]  Absolutely.
[02:28:12.080 --> 02:28:16.400]  We've been banned by YouTube because of our relationship with General Flynn and General
[02:28:16.400 --> 02:28:21.000]  McInerney and some of the generals, they've completely cut all of our Bible studies out
[02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000]  without any warning.
[02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:24.000]  We've been shadow banned.
[02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:28.039]  We have about 2.2 million followers on Facebook, but we're shadow banned.
[02:28:28.039 --> 02:28:29.439]  So we had to do what you had to do.
[02:28:29.439 --> 02:28:32.880]  We went and had to develop our own servers.
[02:28:32.880 --> 02:28:38.480]  So everything we do is on our own servers now so that they can't touch us on www.HisGlory.me
[02:28:38.480 --> 02:28:44.640]  or .tv, but it's been a war, but I'm a Marine, so I'm used to that and we're never going
[02:28:44.640 --> 02:28:45.640]  to quit.
[02:28:45.640 --> 02:28:49.119]  We're going to keep forward and bringing the truth out to America and the world.
[02:28:49.119 --> 02:28:53.400]  We have a great audience of 20 million plus people, literally in every country of the
[02:28:53.400 --> 02:28:54.400]  world.
[02:28:54.400 --> 02:28:55.400]  That's Pastor Dave Scarlett, HisGlory.me.
[02:28:55.400 --> 02:28:57.800]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:57.800 --> 02:29:00.359]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[02:29:00.359 --> 02:29:02.439]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[02:29:02.439 --> 02:29:04.480]  It will change your life.
[02:29:04.480 --> 02:29:09.160]  The UN admits and the Lansing Medical Journal admits that upwards of 2 billion people have
[02:29:09.160 --> 02:29:13.199]  mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[02:29:13.199 --> 02:29:18.720]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[02:29:18.720 --> 02:29:24.460]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[02:29:24.460 --> 02:29:28.759]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[02:29:28.759 --> 02:29:34.599]  And InfoWarsTore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of
[02:29:34.599 --> 02:29:35.599]  full effect.
[02:29:35.599 --> 02:29:38.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3 has been sold out for six months.
[02:29:38.880 --> 02:29:41.880]  It's very hard to produce and it's finally back in stock.
[02:29:41.880 --> 02:29:44.859]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[02:29:44.859 --> 02:29:47.039]  This ladies and gentlemen is powerful.
[02:29:47.039 --> 02:29:48.359]  You and your family need it.
[02:29:48.359 --> 02:29:50.560]  It's 25% off back in stock.
[02:29:50.560 --> 02:29:54.880]  X3, triiodine, exclusively at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:29:54.880 --> 02:29:58.599]  Take action now, but regardless, research is info.
[02:29:58.599 --> 02:30:02.080]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[02:30:02.080 --> 02:30:06.960]  I don't think anybody can deny it and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting
[02:30:06.960 --> 02:30:07.960]  us.
[02:30:07.960 --> 02:30:13.439]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[02:30:13.439 --> 02:30:16.439]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:30:16.439 --> 02:30:20.880]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every
[02:30:20.880 --> 02:30:25.840]  day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[02:30:25.840 --> 02:30:28.759]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:30:28.759 --> 02:30:34.240]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support
[02:30:34.240 --> 02:30:35.240]  us.
[02:30:35.240 --> 02:30:36.240]  I know you spread the word.
[02:30:36.240 --> 02:30:37.240]  I know you pray for us.
[02:30:37.240 --> 02:30:38.240]  That's wonderful.
[02:30:38.240 --> 02:30:39.240]  Keep doing it.
[02:30:39.240 --> 02:30:43.199]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsTore.com and you never buy great
[02:30:43.199 --> 02:30:47.080]  products that enrich and empower your life while at the same time keeping us on air.
[02:30:47.080 --> 02:30:51.480]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:30:51.480 --> 02:30:55.599]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsTore.com, our funding problems
[02:30:55.599 --> 02:30:56.599]  will be over.
[02:30:56.599 --> 02:30:57.599]  Please take action now.
[02:30:57.599 --> 02:31:01.400]  This is Adam King, host of The Adam King Show, joined by the one and only Greg Reis of The
[02:31:01.400 --> 02:31:02.400]  Reis Report.
[02:31:02.400 --> 02:31:06.039]  We wanted to hop on and send everybody to InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:31:06.039 --> 02:31:08.679]  Click this QR code right above Greg Reis.
[02:31:08.679 --> 02:31:14.439]  Buy yourself a Faraday cage, super male vitality, or what Greg has.
[02:31:14.439 --> 02:31:15.840]  Greg, what do you got there?
[02:31:15.840 --> 02:31:20.000]  If you really want to treat yourself to something nice, get yourself an Alexa Pure water filter
[02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:24.880]  and get clean, healthy water whenever you want it, wherever you want it.
[02:31:24.880 --> 02:31:30.119]  Even if the water pressure goes out, the gravity-fed water filter has got you covered.
[02:31:30.119 --> 02:31:31.920]  Absolutely.
[02:31:31.920 --> 02:31:37.000]  And we couldn't do any of this without listener support.
[02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:41.640]  I was telling Greg earlier, we're like the real NPR, the real NPR of the base, right?
[02:31:41.640 --> 02:31:44.720]  So click that QR code right there on your screen right now.
[02:31:44.720 --> 02:31:45.720]  Take out your phone.
[02:31:45.720 --> 02:31:46.720]  Click that QR code.
[02:31:46.720 --> 02:31:48.880]  It'll take you directly to InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:31:48.880 --> 02:31:50.000]  Buy something.
[02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:51.000]  Support the InfoWars.
[02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:54.560]  Keep Alex Jones, Lauren Troyer, Harrison Smith, Greg Reis, Adam King, and the rest of us on
[02:31:54.679 --> 02:31:55.679]  air.

[02:31:56.679 --> 02:31:57.679]  Do it now.

[02:31:58.679 --> 02:32:01.320]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[02:32:01.320 --> 02:32:06.199]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies.
[02:32:06.199 --> 02:32:10.199]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication.
[02:32:10.199 --> 02:32:11.560]  It takes commitment.
[02:32:11.560 --> 02:32:16.279]  That's why I ask listeners respectfully to go to InfoWarsTore.com and buy great products
[02:32:16.279 --> 02:32:23.560]  that will enrich and empower your life while keeping us on air at the very same time.
[02:32:23.560 --> 02:32:24.560]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:32:24.560 --> 02:32:28.679]  To get a signed or unsigned copy of my book, The Great Reset and War for the World, Ultimate
[02:32:28.679 --> 02:32:34.679]  Bone Broth, Back and Stock, Nitric Boost, the amazing CBD oil we have that's the highest

[02:32:40.920 --> 02:32:41.920]  Some of the very best products.
[02:32:41.920 --> 02:32:44.320]  And a lot of you have never shopped at InfoWarsTore.
[02:32:44.320 --> 02:32:45.320]  You've been watching for years.
[02:32:45.320 --> 02:32:49.720]  You've been listening for years, but you've never taken the step to go to InfoWarsTore.
[02:32:49.720 --> 02:32:53.840]  These are great products that really work and are amazing, plus they keep us on air.
[02:32:53.840 --> 02:32:59.320]  So again, please take action and go to InfoWarsTore.com today, and I thank you.
[02:32:59.320 --> 02:33:05.439]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:06.920 --> 02:33:27.280]  You've found it, the tip of the spear, it is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[02:33:27.280 --> 02:33:29.960]  Pastor Dave Scarlett is our guest.
[02:33:29.960 --> 02:33:36.200]  HisGlory.me is the website, you can follow on YouTube at HisGloryTV, on Twitter at HisGloryMe.
[02:33:36.200 --> 02:33:40.600]  Now, Pastor Dave, I actually, I kind of want to get into the dirt with you here.
[02:33:40.600 --> 02:33:49.720]  I want to get a little, I want to get our hands dirty here because I, the circumstances,
[02:33:49.720 --> 02:33:55.720]  the scenarios that are currently in front of us when it comes to the Christian church,
[02:33:55.720 --> 02:34:01.920]  the Christian body, Catholic church, these other churches, like for example, if I drive
[02:34:01.920 --> 02:34:08.640]  around in Austin, Texas, and I'm looking for a church, Catholic, Presbyterian, whatever,
[02:34:08.640 --> 02:34:14.280]  I could drive in a 10 mile square radius, and I'll find 10 churches, and probably 9,
[02:34:14.280 --> 02:34:19.160]  if not 10 of them will have the gay pride flag on the side of the church, or some other
[02:34:19.160 --> 02:34:24.460]  leftist propaganda, or they'll do drag queen story time for kids, I mean, I go to churches
[02:34:24.460 --> 02:34:29.440]  and I confront these pastors that have these drag queen for kids events, and I say, I think
[02:34:29.440 --> 02:34:30.880]  you're a false pastor.
[02:34:30.880 --> 02:34:32.160]  I don't think you're a pastor at all.
[02:34:32.160 --> 02:34:33.160]  I think you're lying.
[02:34:33.160 --> 02:34:38.360]  I think you're using this church for some other agenda, you know, even with some of the non-denominational
[02:34:38.360 --> 02:34:39.360]  stuff.
[02:34:39.360 --> 02:34:46.240]  And so, my question is this, and I mean, I'll even make it personal.
[02:34:46.240 --> 02:34:51.520]  I don't know if the pastor of a church or a priest or what have you is supposed to use
[02:34:51.520 --> 02:34:53.320]  that pulpit as a political pulpit.
[02:34:53.320 --> 02:34:59.920]  I'm not saying that's the case, but to me, for the church to not be guided politically
[02:34:59.960 --> 02:35:04.680]  in these times is a misdeed.
[02:35:04.680 --> 02:35:06.840]  It's missing the boat.
[02:35:06.840 --> 02:35:11.640]  If your church leader is not addressing the real evils in front of us that, yes, do come
[02:35:11.640 --> 02:35:16.160]  from our government, do come from our politicians, I would argue the U.S. government is the most
[02:35:16.160 --> 02:35:19.640]  evil entity on earth, perhaps, at least in my experience.
[02:35:19.640 --> 02:35:28.680]  So is it wrong to expect or to desire a church leader to use his pulpit to get into politics
[02:35:28.680 --> 02:35:31.240]  and direct his church in the right direction?
[02:35:31.240 --> 02:35:33.240]  Because the left is certainly doing that.
[02:35:33.240 --> 02:35:34.520]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:35:34.520 --> 02:35:40.120]  You have to, as long as it matches God's precepts and commandments.
[02:35:40.120 --> 02:35:46.080]  Our theology is the Bible is the infallible word of God, so as long as you're obedient
[02:35:46.080 --> 02:35:49.780]  to his precepts and commandments, that's the problem with these churches today.
[02:35:49.780 --> 02:35:51.760]  Like you said, they're not Christians.
[02:35:51.760 --> 02:35:56.400]  There's no way you can have drag shows and drag queens and do all these things that are
[02:35:56.400 --> 02:36:00.360]  against God's precepts and commandments and call yourself a pastor and call yourself a
[02:36:00.360 --> 02:36:01.640]  Christian church.
[02:36:01.640 --> 02:36:02.680]  You're not.
[02:36:02.680 --> 02:36:05.200]  And it needs to be called out.
[02:36:05.200 --> 02:36:11.480]  God's obedience and his precepts and commandments in the 66 books by 40 authors is very, very,
[02:36:11.480 --> 02:36:15.960]  very simple and very easy to follow, but they don't want to because of itchy ears.
[02:36:15.960 --> 02:36:19.360]  And that's where the, you know, the prophets told us in the end days that they would have
[02:36:19.360 --> 02:36:24.280]  itchy ears telling people what they want to hear instead of the word of God.
[02:36:24.280 --> 02:36:25.280]  That's it.
[02:36:25.280 --> 02:36:26.280]  It's the word of God.
[02:36:27.160 --> 02:36:33.200]  I mean, to me right now, I mean, let's let's just look at the two obvious ones.
[02:36:33.200 --> 02:36:39.240]  And that's the the trans kid agenda and the abortion is health care agenda.
[02:36:39.240 --> 02:36:46.080]  I mean, to me, if your church body is not addressing these things head on and not at least getting
[02:36:46.080 --> 02:36:52.880]  involved in some way politically to make a voter block to try to stop it or a political
[02:36:52.880 --> 02:36:58.840]  movement or a protest or anything to try to stop this, I just have a hard time respecting
[02:36:58.840 --> 02:36:59.840]  those churches.
[02:36:59.840 --> 02:37:00.840]  I'm going to be honest.
[02:37:00.840 --> 02:37:05.260]  I have a hard time respecting any religious leader or church leader that isn't willing
[02:37:05.260 --> 02:37:06.880]  to address these things head on.
[02:37:06.880 --> 02:37:08.680]  Dave, am I wrong for that?
[02:37:08.680 --> 02:37:10.300]  No, you're absolutely right.
[02:37:10.300 --> 02:37:13.240]  I've had an opportunity here in Texas.
[02:37:13.240 --> 02:37:15.560]  We changed our Sunday service to Saturday.
[02:37:15.560 --> 02:37:20.880]  So I on Sunday tour different churches here in Texas and all the world events going on
[02:37:20.880 --> 02:37:24.120]  like this with Target and all these other horrific things.
[02:37:24.120 --> 02:37:28.520]  I've never heard a single pastor that I've been in a church bring these issues up.
[02:37:28.520 --> 02:37:30.680]  It's like they're living in a different world.
[02:37:30.680 --> 02:37:32.280]  These need to be addressed.
[02:37:32.280 --> 02:37:34.720]  These are against God's precepts and commandments.
[02:37:34.720 --> 02:37:38.240]  And the congregation needs to hear this from the from the pulpit.
[02:37:38.240 --> 02:37:42.760]  They need to know the word of God and show how this is not this is not right.
[02:37:42.760 --> 02:37:47.400]  We're in this situation because of the church and because of the silent pulpits and the
[02:37:47.400 --> 02:37:48.480]  itchy ears.
[02:37:48.480 --> 02:37:51.960]  If the church did what they were supposed to do, this would not happen in the United
[02:37:51.960 --> 02:37:52.960]  States of America.
[02:37:52.960 --> 02:37:59.640]  Yeah, I agree, because there is no doubt the Catholic Church, the Christian body here in
[02:37:59.640 --> 02:38:03.000]  America should be able to move mountains politically.
[02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:08.480]  There is no reason why the left and their activists funded by George Soros should be
[02:38:08.480 --> 02:38:12.360]  able to move the political mountains that they've been able to move without any pushback.
[02:38:12.360 --> 02:38:13.360]  And yet it happens.
[02:38:13.360 --> 02:38:14.360]  And you just kind of said it.
[02:38:14.360 --> 02:38:17.180]  You said it's like they don't live in the same world.
[02:38:17.180 --> 02:38:19.220]  That's exactly it.
[02:38:19.220 --> 02:38:20.800]  That's exactly it right there.
[02:38:20.800 --> 02:38:28.140]  It's just how can people continue to go to a church where the pastor seemingly doesn't
[02:38:28.140 --> 02:38:29.680]  even live in the same world?
[02:38:29.680 --> 02:38:33.300]  It's like they don't even know what planet they're living on, not addressing these issues.
[02:38:33.300 --> 02:38:38.020]  And sadly, I think, like you said, that's part of the problem, because people just leave
[02:38:38.020 --> 02:38:40.380]  the church because they're like, well, this pastor don't even know what's going on in the
[02:38:40.380 --> 02:38:41.380]  world.
[02:38:41.380 --> 02:38:42.380]  Exactly.
[02:38:42.380 --> 02:38:44.940]  You know, these people are hurting, they're suffering there.
[02:38:44.940 --> 02:38:46.980]  We had a pandemic thrown at us.
[02:38:46.980 --> 02:38:48.380]  We've had businesses lost.
[02:38:48.380 --> 02:38:55.220]  We've had government overreach and our crops and everything we do.
[02:38:55.220 --> 02:38:57.900]  And the pulpit is staying quiet like this is not happening.
[02:38:57.900 --> 02:39:01.240]  It's affecting every single person in that congregation.
[02:39:01.240 --> 02:39:04.060]  And the pastor needs to stand up and take leadership.
[02:39:04.060 --> 02:39:05.060]  That's what a pastor means.
[02:39:05.060 --> 02:39:09.740]  It means to be the head of the sheep, to guide them and guide them in the word of God and
[02:39:09.740 --> 02:39:14.260]  be a influence to the world and stand up for the right and the wrong of the world and not
[02:39:14.260 --> 02:39:15.300]  be afraid.
[02:39:15.300 --> 02:39:19.380]  Don't be afraid of what the world is going to say about you or them stripping your 501c
[02:39:19.380 --> 02:39:22.220]  or whatever tax status or coming after you.
[02:39:22.220 --> 02:39:24.620]  Like I said earlier, it's prison ministry.
[02:39:24.620 --> 02:39:28.820]  If we don't think we're going to get Jesus told us that we were going to be hated for
[02:39:28.820 --> 02:39:29.820]  his namesake.
[02:39:29.820 --> 02:39:30.820]  But he overcame the world.
[02:39:30.820 --> 02:39:34.820]  Who are we to think we're any different than the apostle Paul that had to stand in the
[02:39:34.820 --> 02:39:37.780]  gap and sing while he was in prison?
[02:39:37.780 --> 02:39:40.420]  We have to have that leadership from the pulpit today.
[02:39:40.420 --> 02:39:45.340]  Another great pastor I met at the Reawaken America tour is Pastor Greg Locke, and I'm
[02:39:45.340 --> 02:39:50.500]  wondering if you've had the same experience as he has had, which is basically when you
[02:39:50.500 --> 02:39:55.940]  do, it's not by design, it's not intentional, it's not a politically motivated thing, it's
[02:39:55.940 --> 02:39:56.940]  how it should be.
[02:39:56.940 --> 02:40:04.300]  When you do turn the pulpit into a political tool against Satan, the church just explodes.
[02:40:04.300 --> 02:40:12.140]  I mean, Pastor Locke's church has just grown immensely since he's really become fiery going
[02:40:12.140 --> 02:40:14.540]  with the political issues from the pulpit.
[02:40:14.540 --> 02:40:16.100]  Have you experienced the same thing?
[02:40:16.100 --> 02:40:21.780]  I mean, I imagine that the pastors that do go down that road, those are the churches that
[02:40:21.780 --> 02:40:22.780]  are going to be growing.
[02:40:22.780 --> 02:40:24.860]  Those are going to be the churches of the future.
[02:40:24.860 --> 02:40:25.860]  Absolutely.
[02:40:25.860 --> 02:40:27.420]  We've seen the same thing.
[02:40:27.420 --> 02:40:29.700]  Pastor Locke's a personal friend of mine.
[02:40:29.700 --> 02:40:34.260]  His explosion is the same explosion his glory has had.
[02:40:34.260 --> 02:40:38.140]  We go around the world, and so many people have come up to us and said to us, you know,
[02:40:38.140 --> 02:40:43.300]  I was not a Christian before I listened to you, or I was a lukewarm Christian, but because
[02:40:43.300 --> 02:40:49.140]  of what you're telling us, the truth of Jesus Christ, we search for it, and we have a hope.
[02:40:49.140 --> 02:40:52.740]  We have a better relationship with our Lord and Savior right now.
[02:40:52.740 --> 02:40:58.700]  That's why we baptize, I think it's over 5,500 people on these Reawaken tours.
[02:40:58.700 --> 02:41:03.460]  The people are just coming in by the thousands, literally, to be baptized, to renew their
[02:41:03.460 --> 02:41:05.860]  life in Jesus Christ, and say, you know what?
[02:41:05.860 --> 02:41:07.140]  I'm not going to take it anymore.
[02:41:07.140 --> 02:41:13.060]  I'm going to finish the race, as the Apostle Paul said, doing the will of the Lord.
[02:41:13.060 --> 02:41:18.580]  Yeah, and I think protecting the children is obviously one of the most important aspects
[02:41:18.580 --> 02:41:24.700]  of this, and maybe there's an instinct that doesn't kick in with people until they do
[02:41:24.700 --> 02:41:31.500]  have children, but that, to me, is a no-brainer, and that, to me, is where Christians have to
[02:41:31.500 --> 02:41:36.540]  be to protect these innocent children from the satanic agenda.
[02:41:36.540 --> 02:41:37.540]  You're absolutely right.
[02:41:37.540 --> 02:41:43.260]  If you can't wrap your heart around an innocent child being killed in the womb, or at nine
[02:41:43.260 --> 02:41:48.740]  weeks, or whatever the weeks are, or what they're doing to these kids in schools, these
[02:41:48.740 --> 02:41:53.940]  drag shows, how a parent or a grandparent could sit and watch that filth, it's just
[02:41:53.940 --> 02:41:55.140]  absolutely mind-blowing.
[02:41:55.140 --> 02:41:58.420]  It breaks my heart, and I know it breaks the Father's heart.
[02:41:58.420 --> 02:42:00.140]  I mean, you'll walk into a Target.
[02:42:00.140 --> 02:42:05.100]  I don't go to Target anymore, but, I mean, people probably should boycott it at this
[02:42:05.100 --> 02:42:06.460]  point if you haven't already.
[02:42:06.460 --> 02:42:11.860]  You walk into a Target, and it's just outright satanism marketed for children.
[02:42:11.860 --> 02:42:17.500]  I mean, that is unreal stuff that this is the current state of affairs we're experiencing.
[02:42:17.500 --> 02:42:20.780]  Yep, you hit a point earlier on.
[02:42:20.780 --> 02:42:25.220]  You said that Satan is desperate, that they're frantic.
[02:42:25.220 --> 02:42:29.020]  Evil is so in our face that we know where that side is.
[02:42:29.020 --> 02:42:33.900]  Now we have to focus on, we can't fix that side, but we can fix the fence.
[02:42:33.900 --> 02:42:34.900]  Satan owns the fence.
[02:42:34.900 --> 02:42:38.740]  We've got to get the Christians and non-believers off the fence and end this battle for our
[02:42:38.740 --> 02:42:42.340]  Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and that's where they're coming in, by the droves.
[02:42:42.340 --> 02:42:43.820]  That's Pastor Dave Scarlett.
[02:42:43.820 --> 02:42:46.260]  HisGlory.me is the website.
[02:42:46.260 --> 02:42:48.500]  That's where you can find the new film as well.
[02:42:48.500 --> 02:42:52.100]  We'll come back, final segment, with Dave on the other side of this break.
[02:42:52.100 --> 02:42:53.100]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:42:53.100 --> 02:42:57.780]  The Alex Jones Show brought to you by InfowarsStore.com.
[02:42:57.820 --> 02:43:00.380]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[02:43:00.380 --> 02:43:02.460]  Please write this down, and please go look this up.
[02:43:02.460 --> 02:43:04.500]  It will change your life.
[02:43:04.500 --> 02:43:08.960]  The UN admits, and the Lansing Medical Journal admits, that upwards of two billion people
[02:43:08.960 --> 02:43:13.220]  have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[02:43:13.220 --> 02:43:18.740]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[02:43:18.740 --> 02:43:24.460]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[02:43:24.460 --> 02:43:30.540]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells, and InfowarsStore.com has
[02:43:30.540 --> 02:43:35.940]  the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect.
[02:43:35.940 --> 02:43:38.860]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for six months.
[02:43:38.860 --> 02:43:41.900]  It's very hard to produce, and it's finally back in stock.
[02:43:41.900 --> 02:43:44.860]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[02:43:44.860 --> 02:43:47.060]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[02:43:47.060 --> 02:43:48.380]  You and your family need it.
[02:43:48.380 --> 02:43:50.580]  It's 25% off, back in stock.
[02:43:50.580 --> 02:43:51.580]  X3.
[02:43:51.580 --> 02:43:54.700]  Try iodine exclusively at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:43:54.700 --> 02:43:57.420]  Take action now, but regardless, research is info.
[02:43:57.420 --> 02:44:00.900]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[02:44:00.900 --> 02:44:08.780]  I want you all to know something, Alex Jones was right.
[02:44:08.780 --> 02:44:12.460]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[02:44:12.460 --> 02:44:15.540]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[02:44:15.540 --> 02:44:19.780]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up, or rub it down.
[02:44:19.780 --> 02:44:22.020]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:44:22.020 --> 02:44:25.500]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[02:44:25.500 --> 02:44:29.220]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[02:44:29.220 --> 02:44:33.140]  Alex Jones called this years ago, years ago.
[02:44:33.140 --> 02:44:37.260]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[02:44:37.260 --> 02:44:39.780]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[02:44:39.780 --> 02:44:42.220]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[02:44:42.220 --> 02:44:45.340]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[02:44:45.340 --> 02:44:49.620]  That's why the globalists hate me, is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide
[02:44:49.620 --> 02:44:57.820]  tyranny.
[02:44:57.820 --> 02:45:03.860]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth, and they've got our
[02:45:03.860 --> 02:45:06.020]  children drinking that.
[02:45:06.020 --> 02:45:11.780]  This is a psychotic death cult, period, case closed, out to get you and your family.
[02:45:11.780 --> 02:45:16.780]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze, made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour Group.
[02:45:16.780 --> 02:45:20.020]  It's been around about 15 years, became the biggest company in the last six.
[02:45:20.020 --> 02:45:24.380]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there
[02:45:24.380 --> 02:45:29.580]  that sells for twice the price, and they made it as good in all the studies.
[02:45:29.580 --> 02:45:33.260]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals, but you can go pay
[02:45:33.260 --> 02:45:34.260]  two or three times.
[02:45:34.260 --> 02:45:37.140]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[02:45:37.140 --> 02:45:41.420]  We sell the very best, highest grade water filtration system for half the price of the
[02:45:41.420 --> 02:45:42.420]  leading competitor.
[02:45:42.420 --> 02:45:47.820]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[02:45:47.820 --> 02:45:49.540]  You should also filter your shower water.
[02:45:49.540 --> 02:45:52.580]  That's another way you absorb this crap, but I'm done talking about that.
[02:45:52.580 --> 02:45:56.700]  The point is, you get the filters at Infowarsstore.com, they're discounted right now, finally back
[02:45:56.700 --> 02:45:57.700]  in stock.
[02:45:57.700 --> 02:46:02.540]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months, and it's TurboForce Plus.
[02:46:02.540 --> 02:46:04.680]  We made it even stronger.
[02:46:04.680 --> 02:46:10.260]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere, TurboForce is back in stock
[02:46:10.260 --> 02:46:15.340]  at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:46:15.340 --> 02:46:21.860]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours, should be
[02:46:21.860 --> 02:46:23.500]  called 10-hour energy.
[02:46:23.500 --> 02:46:28.940]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[02:46:28.940 --> 02:46:34.060]  that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name
[02:46:34.060 --> 02:46:35.060]  it.
[02:46:35.060 --> 02:46:38.580]  It is the super fuel.
[02:46:38.580 --> 02:46:41.860]  RainForce Plus is great, RainForce Alt is great, they're two different nootropics, they
[02:46:41.860 --> 02:46:47.220]  go good with this, but this is the king kong, this is the boss.
[02:46:47.220 --> 02:46:54.580]  TurboForce, back in stock, discounted, Infowarsstore.com, more power, more strength, more energy.
[02:46:58.580 --> 02:47:04.740]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:06.200 --> 02:47:23.280]  Last segment here with Pastor Dave Scarlett, HisGlory.me, and just to make sure, that is
[02:47:23.280 --> 02:47:25.480]  where people can find your new film, right?
[02:47:25.480 --> 02:47:26.480]  HisGlory.me?
[02:47:26.480 --> 02:47:32.200]  Yes, they can find it on HisGlory.me and they can find it on HisGlory.tv, both will be able
[02:47:32.200 --> 02:47:33.200]  to get you to it.
[02:47:33.200 --> 02:47:36.120]  Wonderful, and that is available now?
[02:47:36.120 --> 02:47:39.120]  Not yet, it will be later this summer.
[02:47:39.120 --> 02:47:43.680]  Okay, deep tees then folks, you'll have to wait, we'll get Pastor Dave back on about
[02:47:43.680 --> 02:47:44.680]  that.
[02:47:44.680 --> 02:47:47.360]  Alright, I want to ask about you actually now.
[02:47:47.360 --> 02:47:53.200]  I want to hear about your journey from Marine to Pastor.
[02:47:53.200 --> 02:47:55.760]  What fueled that journey?
[02:47:55.760 --> 02:47:59.320]  What put that course in front of you?
[02:47:59.320 --> 02:48:03.160]  Well, I went from being a Marine to the corporate world.
[02:48:03.160 --> 02:48:08.840]  I was a director of three Fortune 100 companies, and long story short, I lived the corporate
[02:48:08.840 --> 02:48:15.040]  world that made a lot of money, and I had an experience, I had botulism toxin, and I
[02:48:15.040 --> 02:48:20.960]  died and went to heaven, saw the Lord, saw heaven, and long story short, He sent me back
[02:48:20.960 --> 02:48:26.600]  and said, I want you to start a ministry called, by my name, HisGlory.
[02:48:26.600 --> 02:48:27.600]  The rest is history.
[02:48:27.600 --> 02:48:34.680]  It took years of going into the cave and learning His Word and being trained by Him, but He's
[02:48:34.680 --> 02:48:39.720]  been absolutely faithful, so I'm a very unique pastor that gave up the corporate world to
[02:48:39.720 --> 02:48:42.040]  get to become a pastor.
[02:48:42.040 --> 02:48:50.640]  Yeah, and I think that that probably helps you be relatable with the body, the congregation,
[02:48:50.640 --> 02:48:53.440]  I would imagine that's a very relatable thing.
[02:48:53.640 --> 02:48:58.600]  Absolutely, because everything that the Lord uses us for in our life is for such a time
[02:48:58.600 --> 02:48:59.600]  as this.
[02:48:59.600 --> 02:49:04.040]  You know, everybody that's watching this today, you're going to be used by the Lord if you
[02:49:04.040 --> 02:49:09.400]  ask Him to use you, and your life experiences up until this point are all pointing to what
[02:49:09.400 --> 02:49:13.840]  His purpose is for you, and that's why He had to make me a Marine, that's how I had to go
[02:49:13.840 --> 02:49:21.320]  into the corporate world and then be humbled by Him to get rid of self and go out for His
[02:49:21.320 --> 02:49:23.320]  purpose and His glory.
[02:49:23.320 --> 02:49:30.560]  You know, I was having a health conversation last night on a podcast that I host, just
[02:49:30.560 --> 02:49:39.640]  getting into health and getting into stress, and the reason I bring this up is, you know,
[02:49:39.640 --> 02:49:47.800]  when you realize that God's plan is inevitable, and the good and the bad and the ugly that
[02:49:47.800 --> 02:49:53.920]  happens to you in your life is all part of God's plan, the stress just washes away.
[02:49:53.920 --> 02:49:57.880]  And I'm not saying that means you don't have to be concerned or respond or anything like
[02:49:57.880 --> 02:50:02.680]  that, it's just, in those moments, there's a comforting knowing that, you know what,
[02:50:02.680 --> 02:50:07.800]  this is part of God's plan, and so I'm going to roll with this now, even when you go through
[02:50:07.800 --> 02:50:08.800]  the hardships.
[02:50:08.800 --> 02:50:11.920]  I look at some of the mistakes I've made in my life, I look at some of the things in my
[02:50:11.920 --> 02:50:17.060]  life that happened that at the time looked really bad, like wow, this is going to be
[02:50:17.060 --> 02:50:20.980]  really detrimental, but in the end, it was part of God's plan to put me where I need
[02:50:20.980 --> 02:50:21.980]  to be today.
[02:50:21.980 --> 02:50:25.340]  It's very relatable for what you're talking about too, and I think a lot of that too
[02:50:25.340 --> 02:50:30.660]  is I did not, I was not a very patient person, I'm probably still not a very patient person,
[02:50:30.660 --> 02:50:34.820]  but compared to what I was as a younger man, I'm extremely patient.
[02:50:34.820 --> 02:50:42.340]  So what can you talk to when it comes to just relieving that pressure, relieving that stress,
[02:50:42.340 --> 02:50:45.740]  understanding that it's all part of God's plan, and if you have patience, it doesn't
[02:50:45.740 --> 02:50:49.220]  mean it's going to be fun, it doesn't mean it's going to be easy, but if you have patience
[02:50:49.220 --> 02:50:53.700]  and understanding, eventually you'll see, wow, that happened for a reason.
[02:50:53.700 --> 02:50:54.700]  Right.
[02:50:54.700 --> 02:50:57.220]  So that's why we have such an addiction problem in the world.
[02:50:57.220 --> 02:51:01.580]  People are searching for answers to relieve stress or burdens or whatever it may be in
[02:51:01.580 --> 02:51:06.260]  our life, and the only way to overcome that is the blood of the lamb and having that peace
[02:51:06.260 --> 02:51:11.380]  of Jesus Christ, to absorb his word, give him your life and let him guide you, and when
[02:51:11.380 --> 02:51:16.620]  you let him guide you and you see the supernatural come forward with his hand on it, you know
[02:51:16.620 --> 02:51:23.380]  he's got it, and you know, and I've had the ability to see heaven, so I know what the
[02:51:23.380 --> 02:51:28.980]  Bible says is true, because I've been there, and some people need to have extremes in their
[02:51:28.980 --> 02:51:33.180]  life for them to get it, but this is a time that the only shalom you're going to get in
[02:51:33.180 --> 02:51:35.660]  your life is through him and his word.
[02:51:35.660 --> 02:51:41.060]  So I encourage every single person today to get in the word of God, get on your knees
[02:51:41.060 --> 02:51:45.740]  and say, Lord, guide me, because he'll take that stress, he'll take that fear away, and
[02:51:45.740 --> 02:51:50.660]  he'll give you that supernatural shalom, and he'll guide your steps.
[02:51:50.660 --> 02:51:57.060]  Now is that the same message you would give to somebody like, you know, I was raised Christian,
[02:51:57.060 --> 02:52:01.300]  I was raised Catholic, I've been through the confirmation process in the Catholic Church,
[02:52:01.300 --> 02:52:06.020]  I've been through the born-again process in the Christian Church, and so for you to say
[02:52:06.020 --> 02:52:09.580]  something like that to me, okay, I can get that, I can do that, I can kick that into
[02:52:09.580 --> 02:52:14.420]  gear, is that the same approach you might take towards an atheist or towards an agnostic
[02:52:14.420 --> 02:52:17.100]  that might be curious about what we're talking about?
[02:52:17.100 --> 02:52:22.780]  No, what you have to do with somebody that's in Judaism or Islam or atheist, you have
[02:52:22.780 --> 02:52:24.260]  to plant seeds.
[02:52:24.260 --> 02:52:27.940]  They're not going to take that and say, oh, okay, your Jesus is going to, if I just get
[02:52:27.940 --> 02:52:31.620]  in the word of God, there's going to be peace come upon me, they're going to shut their
[02:52:31.620 --> 02:52:32.620]  ears.
[02:52:32.620 --> 02:52:37.380]  But you've got to plant seeds, so you need to be educated enough about other religions
[02:52:37.380 --> 02:52:38.380]  like Islam.
[02:52:38.380 --> 02:52:43.180]  I've studied the Koran, so I know how to plant a seed to an imam or somebody of Islam to
[02:52:43.180 --> 02:52:45.040]  go search it for themselves.
[02:52:45.040 --> 02:52:50.020]  That's why we've had thousands of people in Islam come to Christ, including two imams.
[02:52:50.020 --> 02:52:51.160]  Same with Judaism.
[02:52:51.160 --> 02:52:56.140]  You plant who the Messiah is from the Old Testament so that they search for themselves.
[02:52:56.140 --> 02:52:57.140]  Same with an atheist.
[02:52:57.140 --> 02:53:03.420]  You plant supernatural events on how incredible prophecy is and let them go and search themselves
[02:53:03.420 --> 02:53:07.500]  and they come back and that's how the only way that they're going to find the Lord.
[02:53:07.500 --> 02:53:08.500]  All right.
[02:53:08.500 --> 02:53:13.900]  Now, if people are interested in HisGloryTV or people are interested in maybe being a
[02:53:13.900 --> 02:53:18.060]  part of your congregation or visiting your facilities, where can people get that information?
[02:53:18.060 --> 02:53:19.060]  How can people get involved?
[02:53:19.060 --> 02:53:22.120]  How can people get in touch with Pastor Dave?
[02:53:22.120 --> 02:53:26.260]  You can go to www.HisGlory.me or download our app.
[02:53:26.260 --> 02:53:28.100]  We're looking for more volunteers.
[02:53:28.100 --> 02:53:30.300]  We're looking for more people to expand.
[02:53:30.300 --> 02:53:36.600]  We're in a rapid growth space right now where we're growing a 12,000 square foot facility
[02:53:36.600 --> 02:53:37.600]  here in Texas.
[02:53:37.600 --> 02:53:42.720]  But join all of our programming, our Bible studies, our trip to Israel again.
[02:53:42.720 --> 02:53:46.000]  Going to Israel is an eternal investment.
[02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:50.080]  People's lives are changed once they go to Israel with us because they come back on fire
[02:53:50.080 --> 02:53:51.080]  for the Lord.
[02:53:51.080 --> 02:53:52.080]  All right.
[02:53:52.080 --> 02:53:57.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, again, all the outlets just laid out, Twitter at HisGloryMe, YouTube
[02:53:57.600 --> 02:54:02.720]  at HisGloryTV, HisGlory.tv, HisGlory.me are the websites.
[02:54:02.720 --> 02:54:03.840]  Pastor Dave, great stuff.
[02:54:03.840 --> 02:54:05.320]  Great catching up as always.
[02:54:05.320 --> 02:54:12.360]  And when the film is ready, you come back on this show and we'll help promote it.
[02:54:12.360 --> 02:54:13.480]  I love that, Owen.
[02:54:13.480 --> 02:54:14.480]  Thank you so much.
[02:54:14.480 --> 02:54:16.420]  And thank you for everything you do.
[02:54:16.420 --> 02:54:18.600]  Great to be joined by Pastor Dave Scarlett again.
[02:54:18.600 --> 02:54:20.640]  We'll see you soon, I'm sure.
[02:54:20.640 --> 02:54:21.640]  Wow.
[02:54:21.640 --> 02:54:24.600]  It's just such a relief that there's so many good people fighting the fight in different
[02:54:24.600 --> 02:54:29.520]  avenues and different street corners and different ways and walks of life.
[02:54:29.520 --> 02:54:30.520]  It really is.
[02:54:30.520 --> 02:54:33.520]  It takes the hope and amplifies it to a new level.
[02:54:33.520 --> 02:54:38.320]  And again, from a media perspective, to see how far independent media has come in this
[02:54:38.320 --> 02:54:42.440]  age of censorship, that's just huge.
[02:54:42.440 --> 02:54:47.080]  Because again, I don't look at it as a competition.
[02:54:47.080 --> 02:54:52.400]  Like if I'm on the field in a war or something and I'm slashing and hacking at the enemy
[02:54:52.400 --> 02:54:56.880]  and the enemy's slashing and hacking at me, and then another guy comes up, he's even bigger,
[02:54:56.880 --> 02:55:01.200]  stronger than me with even more weapons, I'm not like, oh no, don't come onto the battlefield.
[02:55:01.200 --> 02:55:03.200]  I'm the one that wants to be under attack the whole time.
[02:55:03.400 --> 02:55:08.400]  No, I'm like, get in here, help us out, I'm under attack, slash these demons with me.
[02:55:08.400 --> 02:55:10.120]  That's what it's like.
[02:55:10.120 --> 02:55:12.560]  So that's just great news there to hear all that.
[02:55:12.560 --> 02:55:17.200]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, everything we do here brought to you by InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:55:17.200 --> 02:55:20.320]  Let's just pull up the storefront right now.
[02:55:20.320 --> 02:55:23.480]  Because I told you about the water filters, folks, this is a no brainer.
[02:55:23.480 --> 02:55:26.400]  If you're not filtering your water, what are you doing?
[02:55:26.400 --> 02:55:27.400]  Seriously.
[02:55:27.400 --> 02:55:30.760]  Whether you're a liberal, whether you're a conservative, whether you're a Christian, whether
[02:55:30.760 --> 02:55:33.720]  you're Jewish, whether you're a Muslim, it doesn't matter.
[02:55:33.720 --> 02:55:35.200]  Filter the water.
[02:55:35.200 --> 02:55:39.240]  Because they poisoned it for all of us.
[02:55:39.240 --> 02:55:41.480]  And we don't want you to drink those toxins.
[02:55:41.480 --> 02:55:43.680]  Get your water filter from InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:55:43.680 --> 02:55:45.160]  We already did the research.
[02:55:45.160 --> 02:55:49.200]  Best quality water filters at the best price at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:55:49.200 --> 02:55:51.360]  Now, the supplements.
[02:55:51.360 --> 02:55:56.800]  I'm into the supplements because I'm into being healthy, I'm into being fit, I'm extremely
[02:55:56.800 --> 02:56:01.400]  active, and so I just like being as healthy as possible.
[02:56:01.400 --> 02:56:04.360]  And that's why I love the supplements at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:56:04.360 --> 02:56:08.920]  But it's one thing to just desire to be as healthy and fit as you can.
[02:56:08.920 --> 02:56:15.080]  It's another thing to understand that because of the modern day diets, we are lacking in
[02:56:15.080 --> 02:56:18.880]  many different things that we need, like iodine.
[02:56:18.880 --> 02:56:23.960]  You can go ahead and plug it into an internet search engine right now that most individuals
[02:56:23.960 --> 02:56:25.520]  are deficient in iodine.
[02:56:25.520 --> 02:56:31.200]  In fact, this was such a known phenomenon that years ago, you may remember, they iodized
[02:56:31.200 --> 02:56:32.200]  the salt.
[02:56:32.200 --> 02:56:35.760]  Now, that is not as much of a common thing these days, but they knew it.
[02:56:35.760 --> 02:56:37.000]  Hey, people are lacking iodine.
[02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:38.000]  They're getting goiters.
[02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:39.000]  They're having these other health problems.
[02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:40.000]  Well, people use salt.
[02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:41.000]  Let's iodize the salt.
[02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:42.000]  Maybe that'll help.
[02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:43.840]  And so perhaps it did.
[02:56:43.840 --> 02:56:45.720]  But we don't really address that anymore.
[02:56:45.720 --> 02:56:48.680]  We're addressing that issue at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:56:48.680 --> 02:56:51.920]  Survival Shield X3 Nascent Iodine.
[02:56:51.920 --> 02:56:53.240]  Don't be deficient in iodine.
[02:56:53.240 --> 02:56:54.280]  Way too important.
[02:56:54.280 --> 02:56:55.600]  It's the good halogen.
[02:56:55.600 --> 02:56:56.600]  You need it.
[02:56:56.600 --> 02:57:01.480]  It's on sale right now, 25% off at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:57:01.480 --> 02:57:03.880]  Another one, magnesium.
[02:57:03.880 --> 02:57:07.000]  You don't want to be deficient in magnesium.
[02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:12.920]  And if you are physically active in many different ways, then you might be deficient in magnesium,
[02:57:12.920 --> 02:57:16.480]  which is key to enzyme function in the body.
[02:57:16.480 --> 02:57:24.200]  So we have the best orange drink mix that happens to be fizzy magnesium drink mix at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:57:25.120 --> 02:57:26.120]  I'm not going to lie.
[02:57:26.120 --> 02:57:27.120]  I drink it because it tastes great.
[02:57:27.120 --> 02:57:28.120]  I come in here to the studio.
[02:57:28.120 --> 02:57:32.480]  I put two scoops in a cup of water and stir it up, and I just love the taste.
[02:57:32.480 --> 02:57:37.520]  But knowing that I'm getting the magnesium and I'm not deficient in magnesium is a bonus.
[02:57:37.520 --> 02:57:43.360]  InfoWarsTore.com, it's your support there that keeps us on the air.
[02:57:43.360 --> 02:57:44.360]  And we thank you for that.
[02:57:46.700 --> 02:57:53.700]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden in plain view.
[02:57:53.700 --> 02:57:56.700]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[02:57:56.700 --> 02:58:06.700]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[02:58:06.700 --> 02:58:19.700]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real pure iodine in the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine and so much more.
[02:58:19.700 --> 02:58:29.700]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet medical journal study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[02:58:29.700 --> 02:58:32.700]  Most iodine is bound to other elements, you don't absorb it.
[02:58:32.700 --> 02:58:37.700]  We have X3, all three types of good iodine together that supercharges your body.
[02:58:37.700 --> 02:58:40.700]  X3 is now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:58:40.700 --> 02:58:43.700]  It's been sold out for over six months for 25% off.

[02:58:47.700 --> 02:58:53.700]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[02:58:53.700 --> 02:58:56.700]  People said no way he's the most powerful that ever happened.
[02:58:56.700 --> 02:58:58.700]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[02:58:58.700 --> 02:59:01.700]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believe they can control him.
[02:59:01.700 --> 02:59:04.700]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[02:59:04.700 --> 02:59:06.700]  It's the same thing with InfoWars.
[02:59:06.700 --> 02:59:12.700]  But InfoWars is not owned by Fox or controlled by George Soros or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[02:59:12.700 --> 02:59:16.700]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[02:59:16.700 --> 02:59:18.700]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[02:59:18.700 --> 02:59:23.700]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[02:59:23.700 --> 02:59:26.700]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[02:59:26.700 --> 02:59:29.700]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand.
[02:59:29.700 --> 02:59:32.700]  Please don't take InfoWars for granted.
[02:59:32.700 --> 02:59:36.700]  We're barely hanging on. We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support.

[02:59:48.700 --> 02:59:52.700]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:52.700 --> 02:59:54.700]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:59:57.700 --> 03:00:03.700]  I want to get into this story on the voter fraud issue, specifically what's going on in Arizona.
[03:00:03.700 --> 03:00:05.700]  Something very important is developing here.
[03:00:05.700 --> 03:00:07.700]  And I want to be clear about the message.
[03:00:07.700 --> 03:00:10.700]  I'm not telling you we've solved all the voter fraud issues.
[03:00:10.700 --> 03:00:15.700]  I'm not telling you you're not going to be dealing with election shenanigans or even have fair elections in the future.
[03:00:15.700 --> 03:00:21.700]  I'm just telling you there's real developments going on right now that could be very impactful in the near future.
[03:00:21.700 --> 03:00:24.700]  This is from the office of Arizona Senator Sonny Borelli.
[03:00:25.700 --> 03:00:32.700]  Arizona State Senate Majority Leader Sonny Borelli is notifying all county board of supervisors within the state of Arizona via letter today
[03:00:32.700 --> 03:00:38.700]  that they must first and foremost prioritize protecting national security during any future elections.
[03:00:38.700 --> 03:00:46.700]  Back in 2017, the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security issued a statement clearly designating election infrastructure as critical infrastructure,
[03:00:47.700 --> 03:00:55.700]  which means these electronic systems must have safeguards in place to prevent any attacks which threaten our national security.
[03:00:55.700 --> 03:01:02.700]  This session, the Senate passed legislation that would have fulfilled federal government requirements to protect critical election infrastructure.
[03:01:02.700 --> 03:01:11.700]  However, Senate Bill 1074 was vetoed by the governor, Democrat Governor Katie Hobbs, that just won the election that many think was false.
[03:01:11.700 --> 03:01:20.700]  Therefore, with the passage of Senate Concurrent Resolution 1037 by the legislature and its transmission to the secretary of state,
[03:01:20.700 --> 03:01:27.700]  the legislature is exercising our authority to see that no electronic voting machines,
[03:01:27.700 --> 03:01:37.700]  no electronic voting systems in the state of Arizona are used as the primary method for conducting, counting, tabulating or verifying federal elections
[03:01:37.700 --> 03:01:40.700]  unless those systems meet necessary standards of protection.
[03:01:40.700 --> 03:01:42.700]  So that's going to be interesting to watch.
[03:01:42.700 --> 03:01:50.700]  The federal government has made it very clear that elections equipment is considered a target by those who want to threaten the safety and security of our country,
[03:01:50.700 --> 03:01:52.700]  said Majority Leader Borrelli.
[03:01:52.700 --> 03:02:02.700]  Quote, We have long ignored this elephant in the room by allowing electronic voting systems made with parts produced in countries considered adversaries to the United States
[03:02:02.700 --> 03:02:06.700]  to be used as a primary method for conducting our elections.
[03:02:06.700 --> 03:02:13.700]  It is in our state's and our nation's best interest that we comply with the implementation of security measures to protect our republic.
[03:02:13.700 --> 03:02:15.700]  Now, you notice there's a little out there.
[03:02:15.700 --> 03:02:20.700]  Oh, we won't use any electronic voting machines anymore unless they meet the standards.
[03:02:20.700 --> 03:02:21.700]  So they could easily do a workaround here.
[03:02:21.700 --> 03:02:27.700]  But but this is let me read the rest of these stories and tell you why this is important.
[03:02:27.700 --> 03:02:36.700]  Judge tosses Carrie Lake's lawsuit after trial on fraudulent signature verification shows at least 274,000 ballots were verified in less than three seconds.
[03:02:36.700 --> 03:02:38.700]  In other words, it was impossible.
[03:02:38.700 --> 03:02:39.700]  They weren't really verified.
[03:02:39.700 --> 03:02:43.700]  And those are the votes that gave the election to Katie Hobbs.
[03:02:43.700 --> 03:02:49.700]  Carrie Lake to make big announcement following judges ruling against her campaign press conference today at one.
[03:02:49.700 --> 03:02:54.700]  So actually, that press conference is probably just kicking off right now, I think.
[03:02:54.700 --> 03:02:56.700]  Or maybe it might be kicking off in the next hour.
[03:02:56.700 --> 03:02:57.700]  This is Pacific time, actually.
[03:02:57.700 --> 03:03:01.700]  So so there may be some big news with that press conference coming up here shortly.
[03:03:01.700 --> 03:03:03.700]  Major fraud exposed.
[03:03:03.700 --> 03:03:08.700]  Democrat donations harvesting operation confirmed in Missouri with video proof.
[03:03:08.700 --> 03:03:12.700]  James O'Keefe now has more video proof of the voter fraud with his O'Keefe Media Group.
[03:03:12.700 --> 03:03:19.700]  They've broken at least four of these stories since James O'Keefe went independent from Project Veritas and started O'Keefe Media Group.
[03:03:20.700 --> 03:03:25.700]  So this battle is not over in Arizona.
[03:03:25.700 --> 03:03:26.700]  It's far from over.
[03:03:26.700 --> 03:03:41.700]  There is a serious push to do away with the electronic voting machine systems as they stand now or at least find some sort of protection mechanisms or ability to see inside and make sure no shenanigans go down.
[03:03:41.700 --> 03:03:44.700]  And this is going to be important to watch.
[03:03:44.700 --> 03:03:51.700]  It's going to be important to watch to see what the Republican does to try to right the distrust of our election system.
[03:03:51.700 --> 03:04:02.700]  It's going to be important to see what goes on inside the state of Arizona and how much the Democrats that are in charge there now are going to be trying to protect these voting systems that nobody trusts.
[03:04:02.700 --> 03:04:05.700]  That tells a story in and of itself.
[03:04:05.700 --> 03:04:10.700]  But consider this, ladies and gentlemen, and this is where things get messy.
[03:04:10.700 --> 03:04:19.700]  And this is why you're going to see a massive, massive push to protect these voting systems and not let anything change in Arizona.
[03:04:19.700 --> 03:04:37.700]  Because, ladies and gentlemen, I truly believe if we fix our election system that I don't trust and if you see a fair result, even if it's just in one state of Arizona, you're going to see Republican candidates win by massive margins.
[03:04:37.700 --> 03:04:43.700]  We're talking 10, 20 point victories for people like Kerry Lake, Blake Masters and others.
[03:04:43.700 --> 03:04:57.700]  And when you see that after just some tweaks to a corrupt system, all of a sudden every other state will look on and every other American will look on and say, huh, so it was a rigged system.
[03:04:58.700 --> 03:05:06.700]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic book that documents the globalists in their own words planned for our future.
[03:05:06.700 --> 03:05:07.700]  That is a hellish future.
[03:05:07.700 --> 03:05:17.700]  Now, you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon or Infowars.com.
[03:05:17.700 --> 03:05:22.700]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[03:05:22.700 --> 03:05:25.700]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[03:05:25.700 --> 03:05:30.700]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy at Infowars.com.
[03:05:30.700 --> 03:05:34.700]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[03:05:34.700 --> 03:05:37.700]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book.
[03:05:37.700 --> 03:05:40.700]  You'll also know that you help keep Infowars on the air.
[03:05:40.700 --> 03:05:44.700]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies.
[03:05:44.700 --> 03:05:54.700]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowars.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate to the library or give them to the local school.
[03:05:54.700 --> 03:05:57.700]  This is an Infowar. I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[03:06:01.700 --> 03:06:07.700]  What an amazing soldier of truth Owen Schroyer is and the whole team at Infowars, by the way.
[03:06:07.700 --> 03:06:10.700]  But Owen just powers on and powers on.
[03:06:10.700 --> 03:06:15.700]  He's such an inspiration to every single person that is out here telling the truth.
[03:06:15.700 --> 03:06:23.700]  Let me tell you today we have a breaking emergency broadcast information from Eagle Pass in Texas.
[03:06:23.700 --> 03:06:26.700]  We have footage that's gone viral, absolutely viral.
[03:06:26.700 --> 03:06:34.700]  Millions of views at this point of the progression of the invasion at the border.
[03:06:34.700 --> 03:06:39.700]  Military aged males being transported to a facility.
[03:06:39.700 --> 03:06:45.700]  And we've got today Lieutenant Colonel Pete Chambers, a former Green Beret special flight surgeon,
[03:06:45.700 --> 03:06:55.700]  who gave an informed consent briefing to 3,000 soldiers at the time of the injections and was told, you know, after that, only a few of those soldiers went ahead with the injections.
[03:06:55.700 --> 03:06:58.700]  He was subsequently relieved of his duties.
[03:06:58.700 --> 03:06:59.700]  Surprise, surprise.
[03:06:59.700 --> 03:07:05.700]  We've also got Christy Hutchison, a journalist from Women Fighting for America, who's been there, who's coming with this footage.
[03:07:06.700 --> 03:07:07.700]  I want to play the initial footage.
[03:07:07.700 --> 03:07:16.700]  If the team can play the video that they're playing now from the start with sound and then we'll get Christy and Doc Chambers on straight after that video with us.
[03:07:18.700 --> 03:07:20.700]  I am live in Eagle Pass, Texas.
[03:07:21.700 --> 03:07:38.700]  And what your audience is looking at right now is a military camp where they are housing and bringing young adult males of fighting age straight off the river on white buses into this facility.
[03:07:38.700 --> 03:07:45.700]  Those camps are used to bring in only young adult males, all of the males that you're seeing coming over the border.
[03:07:45.700 --> 03:07:47.700]  This is where they're housing them.
[03:07:47.700 --> 03:07:51.700]  This has been a plan coordinated effort to take down the United States of America.
[03:07:51.700 --> 03:07:53.700]  I believe like a Trojan horse from inside.
[03:07:53.700 --> 03:07:58.700]  So what can the people in Eagle Pass, Texas do in the county that you're in to stop what is happening?
[03:07:58.700 --> 03:08:00.700]  I mean, obviously you're there exposing it.
[03:08:00.700 --> 03:08:01.700]  What should they be doing?
[03:08:01.700 --> 03:08:06.700]  Our congressmen, our governors, they need to act and they need to act now.
[03:08:06.700 --> 03:08:09.700]  I'm telling America right now, stop living under a rock.
[03:08:09.700 --> 03:08:13.700]  This is an active, well-coordinated invasion into the nation.
[03:08:13.700 --> 03:08:17.700]  We have Iran's Revolutionary Guard and Cut Forces flying into Venezuela.
[03:08:17.700 --> 03:08:21.700]  The Venezuelan government is then giving them passports and proper documentation.
[03:08:21.700 --> 03:08:23.700]  They're being absorbed in these caravans.
[03:08:23.700 --> 03:08:26.700]  It's mostly Venezuelans coming in, all males.
[03:08:26.700 --> 03:08:33.700]  If you think that that fertilizer is not going to be utilized, those ammonium nitrate that can be used as massive bombs.
[03:08:33.700 --> 03:08:39.700]  Timothy McVeigh, when he blew up the Oklahoma City bombing, I think it was only two tons that he used.
[03:08:39.700 --> 03:08:41.700]  26 tons went missing.
[03:08:41.700 --> 03:08:48.700]  Is it going to take multiple little mini 9-11 events for America for you to wake up?
[03:08:48.700 --> 03:08:53.700]  So we all know, I mean, Pete Santilli was speaking about this, if you didn't catch it.
[03:08:53.700 --> 03:08:58.700]  30 tons of explosive chemicals have disappeared somewhere between Cheyenne and California.
[03:08:58.700 --> 03:09:05.700]  A rail car carrying 60,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate, a chemical used in explosives at Wyoming coal mines,
[03:09:05.700 --> 03:09:08.700]  left Cheyenne for California on the 12th of April.
[03:09:08.700 --> 03:09:10.700]  That's gone missing now.
[03:09:10.700 --> 03:09:13.700]  And so we think that this is potentially connected.
[03:09:13.700 --> 03:09:20.700]  It ties in with what Pete Santilli and Alex have been warning about, about this planned invasion, planned false flag attacks.
[03:09:20.700 --> 03:09:23.700]  Dr. Pete Chambers and Christy Hutchison, join us now.
[03:09:23.700 --> 03:09:26.700]  Thank you so much for coming on today, guys.
[03:09:26.700 --> 03:09:28.700]  Thank you for having us.
[03:09:28.700 --> 03:09:29.700]  Good day.
[03:09:29.700 --> 03:09:30.700]  It's wonderful.
[03:09:30.700 --> 03:09:31.700]  It's wonderful to see you both.
[03:09:31.700 --> 03:09:32.700]  It's great to see you both.
[03:09:32.700 --> 03:09:37.700]  So I guess from the beginning, this is really breaking stuff, what's happening.
[03:09:37.700 --> 03:09:39.700]  You've been out there, Christy.
[03:09:39.700 --> 03:09:47.700]  You went out to this camp, this military camp, and saw that there were fighting-aged males being brought in by buses.
[03:09:47.700 --> 03:09:50.700]  Take us through the situation from the start.
[03:09:50.700 --> 03:09:51.700]  Absolutely.
[03:09:51.700 --> 03:09:54.700]  Well, I was on the ground on Saturday.
[03:09:54.700 --> 03:10:00.700]  Saturday evening and Sunday, we went to a very specific spot underneath the bridge at the port of entry.
[03:10:00.700 --> 03:10:02.700]  And at that time, there was no containers.
[03:10:02.700 --> 03:10:05.700]  There was no bobbed wire in this particular area.
[03:10:05.700 --> 03:10:13.700]  We were met by numerous different law enforcement agencies, really agitated and upset that I was there and I was filming and exposing what was going on.
[03:10:13.700 --> 03:10:17.700]  They had six buses, white buses, staged.
[03:10:17.700 --> 03:10:23.700]  And they had, I would say, well, so how many individuals are on one of those buses?
[03:10:23.700 --> 03:10:25.700]  60, 70?
[03:10:25.700 --> 03:10:30.700]  So you're talking about 500, 600 individuals, single adult, young adult males.
[03:10:30.700 --> 03:10:33.700]  We filmed this live while this was going on.
[03:10:33.700 --> 03:10:41.700]  They were ushering them privately, processing them by the way, illegally processing them on the banks of the river, putting them on these buses.
[03:10:41.700 --> 03:10:44.700]  And then we wanted to figure out where they were being taken.
[03:10:44.700 --> 03:10:49.700]  We also have some intel on the ground that we work with some local law enforcement officers.
[03:10:49.700 --> 03:10:56.700]  And they pulled me aside and they said, Christy, not even the sheriffs, nobody knows that this particular military-style camp is there.
[03:10:56.700 --> 03:10:58.700]  They're housing the young adult males.
[03:10:58.700 --> 03:11:01.700]  This is where they're intaking them and outtaking them.
[03:11:01.700 --> 03:11:06.700]  So we got that location and off we went the very next day.
[03:11:06.700 --> 03:11:08.700]  We started exposing that.
[03:11:08.700 --> 03:11:14.700]  And in one of the videos, again, we're met with individuals writing up to us telling us we cannot be there, threatening us.
[03:11:14.700 --> 03:11:18.700]  And, of course, we stand our ground because we know what our constitutional rights are.
[03:11:18.700 --> 03:11:20.700]  So we were able to test this out.
[03:11:20.700 --> 03:11:23.700]  Who's telling you, Christy, who's telling you that you can't be there?
[03:11:23.700 --> 03:11:26.700]  Oh, I had DPS.
[03:11:27.700 --> 03:11:32.700]  I was on the private golf course because I went around to try to get it from a different angle.
[03:11:32.700 --> 03:11:40.700]  I was told and threatened that if I took one more step, they were going to physically, violently remove me off of public property.
[03:11:40.700 --> 03:11:49.700]  Me, an illegal American citizen, all the while they're letting illegals of young adult fighting against this nation.
[03:11:49.700 --> 03:11:52.700]  Well, this is absolutely astounding to me.
[03:11:52.700 --> 03:11:58.700]  So you've then, Colonel Pete Chambers, Dr. Pete Chambers, you've been involved now.
[03:11:58.700 --> 03:12:00.700]  You found out about this situation.
[03:12:00.700 --> 03:12:02.700]  I know you've been at the border for some time.
[03:12:02.700 --> 03:12:09.700]  Talk to us about your observations on the ground, and then we can talk about what's happened since this footage has gone viral.
[03:12:09.700 --> 03:12:10.700]  Perfect, Maria.
[03:12:10.700 --> 03:12:15.700]  So Christy called me and said, you need to get down here and look at this.
[03:12:15.700 --> 03:12:18.700]  Some other folks stepped in and said, all right, Doc, you need to get down that way.
[03:12:18.700 --> 03:12:20.700]  We're working on the border anyway.
[03:12:20.700 --> 03:12:29.700]  So getting down here, having been here for the past couple years in uniform, now I'm down here as a civilian, and I'm just helping out.
[03:12:29.700 --> 03:12:33.700]  And what I'm seeing is that the border is three times as many people coming.
[03:12:33.700 --> 03:12:35.700]  The numbers are out there.
[03:12:35.700 --> 03:12:36.700]  They're talking about apprehensions.
[03:12:36.700 --> 03:12:37.700]  They're not apprehending.
[03:12:37.700 --> 03:12:39.700]  They're turning around and releasing them out into the streets.
[03:12:39.700 --> 03:12:42.700]  This particular spot in Eagle Pass goes directly into town.
[03:12:42.700 --> 03:12:44.700]  There's a point of entry going overhead.
[03:12:44.700 --> 03:12:49.700]  And what we're seeing on the Mike side, on the Mexican side, is the federales are increasing their presence.
[03:12:49.700 --> 03:12:52.700]  And what they're doing is, and you can see the porta-potties coming up.
[03:12:52.700 --> 03:13:03.700]  And so thank goodness that Christy did what she did, because within 24 hours, 48 hours, a double-stack container wall was created, is being created as we speak.
[03:13:03.700 --> 03:13:12.700]  And 40-foot connexes are being double-stacked with concertina wire so that something could be done, because this is embarrassing to the current government.
[03:13:12.700 --> 03:13:14.700]  And so, look, we've got to get out here.
[03:13:14.700 --> 03:13:15.700]  That's what we're doing.
[03:13:16.700 --> 03:13:19.700]  So people will move and act on these things.
[03:13:19.700 --> 03:13:22.700]  All right, well, I've sent through some footage to the team this morning.
[03:13:22.700 --> 03:13:26.700]  We've had some technical difficulties with that footage coming through.
[03:13:26.700 --> 03:13:28.700]  As soon as they've got it, I'm sure they'll bring it up.
[03:13:28.700 --> 03:13:33.700]  We've got photos of some of the barbed wire that's being put up.
[03:13:33.700 --> 03:13:40.700]  We've also got footage of you, both of you, here it is, both of you in the car driving through this camp.
[03:13:40.700 --> 03:13:44.700]  Christy, can you describe what you saw inside this camp?
[03:13:45.700 --> 03:13:58.700]  So I'm not going to expose who the individual is right now, but one of a great patriot friend in law enforcement was able to, today, get us inside this camp because, like I said, they would not allow us in.
[03:13:58.700 --> 03:14:02.700]  I want you to see the sophistication and the equipment that is in this camp and how big.
[03:14:02.700 --> 03:14:04.700]  Right there is one of the intakes.
[03:14:04.700 --> 03:14:06.700]  The intake is bus-size.
[03:14:06.700 --> 03:14:12.700]  So two busloads, side-by-side, two buses side-by-side can go into that intake tent.
[03:14:12.700 --> 03:14:16.700]  Then on the back side, which you're going to see in just a minute, is the outtake.
[03:14:16.700 --> 03:14:21.700]  But in between there, there's about five to six massive tents in between.
[03:14:21.700 --> 03:14:23.700]  This is a massive operation.
[03:14:23.700 --> 03:14:25.700]  This is by the federal government.
[03:14:25.700 --> 03:14:27.700]  This is not local or state-ran.
[03:14:27.700 --> 03:14:31.700]  This is a federal operation, and this is a military-style camp.
[03:14:31.700 --> 03:14:34.700]  And by the way, no law enforcement.
[03:14:34.700 --> 03:14:40.700]  We've been on the phone with the sheriffs in numerous counties surrounding this, and every single one of them were shocked.
[03:14:40.700 --> 03:14:44.700]  They had no idea that this was even built and that this was an operation.
[03:14:44.700 --> 03:14:50.700]  Yeah, Maria, something I'd like to add, too, is we also learned that a company called Deployed Resources is running the contract.
[03:14:50.700 --> 03:14:56.700]  They got put in the queue ahead of other contractors on this, and these people are connected to Kamala Harris.
[03:14:56.700 --> 03:14:58.700]  The borders are.
[03:14:58.700 --> 03:15:04.700]  So it makes one wonder when you see Border Patrol, so this is a federal-controlled installation.
[03:15:04.700 --> 03:15:13.700]  It's empty right now, far as we can tell, but we were allowed access through our contact and doing the homework and then finding out who's contracting it.
[03:15:13.700 --> 03:15:16.700]  And it went up over 72 hours, and this is in his county.
[03:15:16.700 --> 03:15:21.700]  He has no idea that he's about to get this influx of extra illegals coming in.
[03:15:21.700 --> 03:15:27.700]  And if it is true that these people are going directly and they're from the border fighting HMALs, that's a concern.
[03:15:27.700 --> 03:15:29.700]  Oh, it's beyond a concern.
[03:15:29.700 --> 03:15:33.700]  I mean, this is, again, this is something that Alex has been warning about.
[03:15:33.700 --> 03:15:39.700]  He's had intel from the top levels saying that there is a planned series of false flag attacks.
[03:15:39.700 --> 03:15:44.700]  You know, Pete Santilli said, stay away from shopping centers, stay away from public places.
[03:15:44.700 --> 03:15:48.700]  There's clearly something more than just what we're seeing on the surface.
[03:15:48.700 --> 03:15:49.700]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:15:49.700 --> 03:15:54.700]  We'll be right back with more of this from Lieutenant Colonel Chambers and Christy Hutchison.
[03:15:54.900 --> 03:16:11.539]  You need to get coordinated with not only your food, but also your health supplements
[03:16:11.539 --> 03:16:14.180]  because it's going to be a matter of life and death.
[03:16:14.180 --> 03:16:16.180]  So support InfoWars store.
[03:16:16.180 --> 03:16:20.619]  Listen, you need to put it as a priority because you don't know.
[03:16:20.619 --> 03:16:21.619]  I don't know.
[03:16:21.619 --> 03:16:24.900]  They're telling you how late it is before midnight strikes.
[03:16:24.900 --> 03:16:29.500]  And again, magnesium is critical for your muscles and everything.
[03:16:29.500 --> 03:16:30.500]  Krill oil.
[03:16:30.500 --> 03:16:36.619]  What I'm watching right before my eyes is a composite overview of nutritional supplements
[03:16:36.619 --> 03:16:38.220]  that will keep you alive.
[03:16:38.220 --> 03:16:42.140]  And I would urge everyone, maybe you don't take vitamins, maybe you don't take nutritional
[03:16:42.140 --> 03:16:44.580]  supplements, but the day will come.
[03:16:44.580 --> 03:16:48.539]  Vitamin C and zinc, absolutely imperative for the cold DNA force.
[03:16:49.380 --> 03:16:50.380]  Mineral fusion.
[03:16:50.380 --> 03:16:51.380]  Absolutely.
[03:16:51.380 --> 03:16:54.380]  As you're drinking filtered water, a lot of it will become demineralized.
[03:16:54.380 --> 03:16:57.539]  You have to have these products.
[03:16:57.539 --> 03:16:59.699]  Sold out for more than a year.

[03:18:56.180 --> 03:18:57.180]  Do it now.
[03:18:57.180 --> 03:18:58.180]  Support the InfoWars.
[03:18:58.180 --> 03:19:02.900]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden
[03:19:02.900 --> 03:19:04.539]  in plain view.
[03:19:04.539 --> 03:19:07.260]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[03:19:07.260 --> 03:19:11.539]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number
[03:19:11.539 --> 03:19:16.779]  one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[03:19:16.779 --> 03:19:24.060]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real, pure iodine in
[03:19:24.060 --> 03:19:30.380]  the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine, and so much more.
[03:19:30.380 --> 03:19:36.539]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive
[03:19:36.539 --> 03:19:40.460]  disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[03:19:40.460 --> 03:19:42.699]  Most iodine is bound to other elements, you don't absorb it.
[03:19:42.699 --> 03:19:48.180]  We have X3, all three types of good iodine together that supercharges your body.
[03:19:48.180 --> 03:19:50.500]  X3 is now back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:19:50.500 --> 03:19:54.380]  It's been sold out for over six months for 25% off.
[03:19:54.380 --> 03:19:55.779]  X3 back in stock.
[03:19:55.779 --> 03:19:56.779]  Take action now.
[03:19:56.779 --> 03:19:57.779]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:19:57.779 --> 03:20:04.420]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:05.900 --> 03:20:17.380]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm your guest host, Maria Zee of zmedia.com.
[03:20:17.380 --> 03:20:22.140]  We are here with an emergency broadcast with Lieutenant Colonel Pete Chambers and Christy
[03:20:22.140 --> 03:20:26.500]  Hutchison, who's a journalist exposing this invasion.
[03:20:26.500 --> 03:20:31.300]  Military age males being brought to government run camps, and it's exclusively males that
[03:20:31.300 --> 03:20:33.900]  are being brought in on these white buses.
[03:20:33.900 --> 03:20:38.500]  We know that Infowars has done such a great job, Owen's done a great job exposing what's
[03:20:38.500 --> 03:20:41.140]  happening there at the border, but this is next level.
[03:20:41.140 --> 03:20:43.100]  I have more questions, guys.
[03:20:43.100 --> 03:20:47.240]  So first of all, you mentioned people from Venezuela.
[03:20:47.240 --> 03:20:51.779]  What is the likely demographic of these males that are being transported?
[03:20:51.779 --> 03:20:58.420]  Yeah, so the intel that we're getting after talking to numerous different agencies who
[03:20:58.420 --> 03:21:02.800]  are helping to facilitate the processing of them, they are all saying consistently most
[03:21:02.800 --> 03:21:06.160]  everyone that they're seeing are from Venezuela at this point.
[03:21:06.160 --> 03:21:10.600]  One of my concerns, Maria, we've been doing some intel on this for a very long time.
[03:21:10.600 --> 03:21:15.000]  We went all the way back to the summer of last year, looking at some aircraft that took
[03:21:15.000 --> 03:21:21.960]  off a mysterious plane, and we started looking at cargo and container and air traffic.
[03:21:21.960 --> 03:21:26.420]  We know that Iran's Revolutionary Guard has taken off from Iran.
[03:21:26.420 --> 03:21:28.560]  They go into Venezuela, Caracas.
[03:21:28.560 --> 03:21:32.080]  They also have landed in Mexico and in Buenos Aires.
[03:21:32.080 --> 03:21:36.760]  On there, not only was there one of the head leaders for Iran's Revolutionary Guard flying
[03:21:36.760 --> 03:21:42.600]  this U.S.-sanctioned aircraft, but they also had highly sophisticated cyber-intelligence
[03:21:42.600 --> 03:21:43.600]  equipment.
[03:21:43.600 --> 03:21:47.119]  Fourteen Venezuelans were cyber-intelligence operatives.
[03:21:47.119 --> 03:21:52.859]  We know this because Uruguay turned this plane around because they ran the actual numbers
[03:21:52.859 --> 03:21:57.080]  on the plane and were able to tell that it was a U.S.-sanctioned aircraft.
[03:21:57.080 --> 03:22:00.480]  But what our also intel is learned twofold.
[03:22:00.480 --> 03:22:07.039]  One that the Iranian, Iran is sending their guardsmen and Quds forces to Venezuela.
[03:22:07.039 --> 03:22:12.600]  Then the Venezuelan government currently, Maria, is giving them passports and documentation,
[03:22:12.600 --> 03:22:15.520]  legal documentation stating that they're Venezuelan citizens.
[03:22:15.520 --> 03:22:20.000]  And then they're utilizing that documentation, we believe, to embed themselves in these caravans
[03:22:20.000 --> 03:22:22.760]  and come over the border and asking for asylum.
[03:22:22.760 --> 03:22:28.240]  The other part of that is, we know for a fact, we've identified three training camps
[03:22:28.240 --> 03:22:33.000]  that the cartels are utilizing and they're actively training with the Iran's Revolutionary
[03:22:33.000 --> 03:22:38.119]  Guard right here along the Texas and Arizona borders.
[03:22:38.119 --> 03:22:42.640]  So on the camps, Lieutenant Colonel Chambers, maybe you can speak to this.
[03:22:42.640 --> 03:22:47.680]  With your history, did you notice any particular training areas within the facility that are
[03:22:47.680 --> 03:22:52.480]  likely used to train military men?
[03:22:53.199 --> 03:22:54.199]  Yeah, great question.
[03:22:54.199 --> 03:22:56.800]  I think that this is more like a reception facility.
[03:22:56.800 --> 03:23:00.840]  Because when we go, let's say I go to a basic training and go to a reception site first,
[03:23:00.840 --> 03:23:05.039]  this looks more like that because of the way that it's up against a large avenue of
[03:23:05.039 --> 03:23:06.039]  approach.
[03:23:06.039 --> 03:23:08.279]  If I was to do a training area, I would do it somewhere away.
[03:23:08.279 --> 03:23:11.640]  But I think in the darkness of night, you have the fences all blocked out.
[03:23:11.640 --> 03:23:16.720]  You have bus bays that are blocked from view because this is a problem you've been seeing
[03:23:16.720 --> 03:23:20.680]  with some of the other InfoWare people trying to get video of them loading.
[03:23:20.680 --> 03:23:23.359]  You're not getting those anymore when you put them inside these camps with double wall
[03:23:23.359 --> 03:23:24.359]  closures.
[03:23:24.359 --> 03:23:27.680]  Now, there's another important point, history.
[03:23:27.680 --> 03:23:33.000]  History shows that the Quds Force were the same people that we fought in Iraq and Afghanistan
[03:23:33.000 --> 03:23:39.560]  that trained those fighters, Motti Army, etc., how to use organophosphates, this type
[03:23:39.560 --> 03:23:41.320]  of material that's been stolen.
[03:23:41.320 --> 03:23:45.279]  I have no connection between that just yet, but we've got to consider the most dangerous
[03:23:45.279 --> 03:23:46.600]  course of action.
[03:23:46.600 --> 03:23:50.760]  These type of bombs, homemade explosives, can be formulated, and that is a typical
[03:23:50.760 --> 03:23:53.160]  technique used by Quds Force.
[03:23:53.160 --> 03:23:58.199]  And the arrangement between Venezuela and Iran is not new.
[03:23:58.199 --> 03:24:00.160]  This has been decades in the making.
[03:24:00.160 --> 03:24:02.320]  They've been training down there for decades.
[03:24:02.320 --> 03:24:06.520]  So we have to look at all these factors, and then that's where we do analysis and we figure
[03:24:06.520 --> 03:24:07.520]  it out.
[03:24:07.520 --> 03:24:11.920]  And so we're measuring three times right now, just a couple months, but it'll happen.
[03:24:11.920 --> 03:24:13.640]  We'll figure it out.
[03:24:13.640 --> 03:24:19.440]  Do we have any indication as to whether they'll be arming these people within these camps?
[03:24:19.440 --> 03:24:21.240]  No indication from my standpoint.
[03:24:21.240 --> 03:24:24.640]  Nothing within this camp that was visualized, but it doesn't mean we're not going to stop
[03:24:24.640 --> 03:24:28.680]  trying because if enough people hear this, this is the importance of your show, of all
[03:24:28.680 --> 03:24:29.680]  these shows.
[03:24:29.680 --> 03:24:33.840]  Is it enough people start paying attention, we'll get the eyes out there and somebody
[03:24:33.840 --> 03:24:34.840]  will come forward.
[03:24:34.840 --> 03:24:39.840]  The whistleblower right now is the Paul Revere, and that's what we need.
[03:24:39.840 --> 03:24:50.160]  Maria, if you go back over two years almost into the Biden administration, me and my team
[03:24:50.160 --> 03:24:55.119]  had followed some of this activity all the way up into outside of Alma, Michigan.
[03:24:55.119 --> 03:24:59.699]  We know for a fact that they've taken either at-risk boys' youth camps, they've also taken
[03:24:59.699 --> 03:25:06.380]  senior living facilities, and through NGOs for some of this, and then through the military
[03:25:06.500 --> 03:25:10.779]  have turned in some of these private properties where they were purchased, and now they're
[03:25:10.779 --> 03:25:12.220]  fortified camps.
[03:25:12.220 --> 03:25:14.500]  We are going to get to the bottom of this.
[03:25:14.500 --> 03:25:18.980]  Two weeks before Christmas this past year in Yuma sector in St. Louis County, I was
[03:25:18.980 --> 03:25:22.779]  riding along with my dear friend, police chief Jessup at the time.
[03:25:22.779 --> 03:25:28.260]  We also uncovered one of the biggest, most sophisticated tunnels ever found on US soil.
[03:25:28.260 --> 03:25:33.020]  So much so that when we rolled in and found this tunnel, the Biden administration had
[03:25:33.020 --> 03:25:37.420]  scientists there, a three-letter agency, and a special division in Homeland Security.
[03:25:37.420 --> 03:25:40.220]  This particular tunnel, why is it of interest?
[03:25:40.220 --> 03:25:44.380]  It had fortified walls and ceilings, 25 feet underneath the ground, rail system ventilation,
[03:25:44.380 --> 03:25:48.820]  fiber optics, air conditioning, and electricity.
[03:25:48.820 --> 03:25:53.660]  It was four and a half football fields long, started in a warehouse, came up in a home
[03:25:53.660 --> 03:25:55.180]  across the way.
[03:25:55.180 --> 03:25:56.740]  What were the scientists doing down there?
[03:25:56.740 --> 03:25:57.740]  What are they looking for?
[03:25:57.740 --> 03:25:58.740]  Are they looking for particles?
[03:25:58.740 --> 03:26:00.940]  Are they looking for bioweapons?
[03:26:00.940 --> 03:26:07.539]  We have a very serious national security threat imminent at our doors if not only the
[03:26:07.539 --> 03:26:11.060]  people don't act, but our legislators do not act.
[03:26:11.060 --> 03:26:14.260]  Well, you're speaking to a wider problem, Christy.
[03:26:14.260 --> 03:26:19.340]  It's not just, I mean, what we're seeing on the surface with the border is the result
[03:26:19.340 --> 03:26:25.619]  of the deep state destroying this country for some time, and we're actively working
[03:26:25.619 --> 03:26:30.020]  against the people of America, the people of the whole world.
[03:26:30.100 --> 03:26:36.539]  When you reference biolabs, we only know what's been discovered in Ukraine, the Doherty Institute
[03:26:36.539 --> 03:26:41.980]  in Australia, their connection to the biolabs in Ukraine, collecting blood serum samples
[03:26:41.980 --> 03:26:49.340]  and God knows what else to create gene-specific bioweapons or carry out specific attacks on
[03:26:49.340 --> 03:26:51.859]  certain races.
[03:26:51.859 --> 03:26:56.300]  This is something that we now have evidence of that was exposed by the Russian Ministry
[03:26:56.300 --> 03:26:57.300]  of Defense.
[03:26:57.300 --> 03:26:59.779]  Who knows what else is happening underground?
[03:27:00.539 --> 03:27:02.619]  Everything that you're saying is not a stretch.
[03:27:02.619 --> 03:27:07.060]  And again, what we're seeing now, everything that you and Lieutenant Colonel Chambers are
[03:27:07.060 --> 03:27:11.980]  talking about today is really just a symptom of the greater problem.
[03:27:11.980 --> 03:27:17.340]  But I don't trust these governments, I don't trust these people that are installed by the
[03:27:17.340 --> 03:27:21.060]  New World Order to destroy our countries, to destroy the West.
[03:27:21.060 --> 03:27:25.580]  And I fear there's something much more sinister here, particularly again in light of the intel
[03:27:25.580 --> 03:27:28.740]  that both Alex and Pete Santilli have been bringing forward.
[03:27:28.740 --> 03:27:33.340]  I want to ask you, these males that are coming in, they're not coming in with the masses
[03:27:33.340 --> 03:27:34.340]  you're saying?
[03:27:34.340 --> 03:27:38.820]  Are they actually being specially brought in?
[03:27:38.820 --> 03:27:44.060]  Well what's going on is there's massive groups of them together and they're separated and
[03:27:44.060 --> 03:27:45.820]  they're put on these buses.
[03:27:45.820 --> 03:27:51.300]  And you know, we can only right now at this point, you know, give our best guesstimated
[03:27:51.300 --> 03:27:56.300]  professional opinions on what we believe is happening inside these processing centers.
[03:27:56.380 --> 03:28:00.940]  And what I'm thinking from a military perspective is just like you do, you process, you bring,
[03:28:00.940 --> 03:28:01.940]  you have an intake.
[03:28:01.940 --> 03:28:08.060]  Well, then you identify, and then you separate, and then you identify who and where you want
[03:28:08.060 --> 03:28:14.060]  that individual to go, what type of possible skill sets they have.
[03:28:14.060 --> 03:28:18.980]  I know for a fact, me and my team, and if you followed us on WFFA.win, you'll see a
[03:28:18.980 --> 03:28:20.340]  lot of our video.
[03:28:20.340 --> 03:28:27.020]  We have Russians, we have Chinese military, we have guerrilla type guys who we've actually
[03:28:27.020 --> 03:28:33.619]  taken photographs of where they've separated them out and put them in a separate area and
[03:28:33.619 --> 03:28:38.220]  then put them on buses to go to probably processing facilities like this.
[03:28:38.220 --> 03:28:41.340]  And by the way, this isn't the only one that we were told exists.
[03:28:41.340 --> 03:28:44.860]  We're going to find out where every single one of these camps are and we're going to bring
[03:28:44.860 --> 03:28:47.500]  it to light.
[03:28:47.500 --> 03:28:48.500]  And so you should.
[03:28:48.500 --> 03:28:49.500]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:28:49.500 --> 03:28:53.220]  We'll be right back with Lieutenant Colonel Chambers and Christy Hutchison right after
[03:28:53.220 --> 03:28:56.980]  this short break.
[03:28:56.980 --> 03:29:01.779]  Turbo Force is back, sold out for eight months, and it's Turbo Force Plus.
[03:29:01.779 --> 03:29:03.939]  We made it even stronger.
[03:29:03.939 --> 03:29:07.860]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[03:29:07.860 --> 03:29:14.580]  Turbo Force is back in stock at infowarestore.com or AAA253-3139.
[03:29:14.580 --> 03:29:21.100]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours, should be
[03:29:21.100 --> 03:29:22.720]  called 10-hour energy.
[03:29:22.720 --> 03:29:28.180]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[03:29:28.180 --> 03:29:33.340]  that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name
[03:29:33.340 --> 03:29:34.340]  it.
[03:29:34.340 --> 03:29:37.779]  It is the super fuel.
[03:29:37.779 --> 03:29:39.220]  Rain Force Plus is great.
[03:29:39.220 --> 03:29:40.220]  Rain Force Ultra is great.
[03:29:40.220 --> 03:29:41.220]  They're two different nootropics.
[03:29:41.220 --> 03:29:44.580]  No good with this, but this is the King Kong.
[03:29:44.580 --> 03:29:46.699]  This is the boss.
[03:29:46.699 --> 03:29:56.740]  Turbo Force, back in stock, discounted, infowarestore.com, more power, more strength, more energy.
[03:29:56.740 --> 03:29:59.340]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[03:29:59.340 --> 03:30:01.420]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[03:30:01.420 --> 03:30:03.460]  It will change your life.
[03:30:03.460 --> 03:30:08.100]  The UN admits and the Lancet Medical Journal admits that upwards of 2 billion people have
[03:30:08.100 --> 03:30:12.140]  mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[03:30:12.140 --> 03:30:17.660]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[03:30:17.660 --> 03:30:23.400]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[03:30:23.400 --> 03:30:29.660]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells and infowarestore.com has the
[03:30:29.660 --> 03:30:34.699]  only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect.
[03:30:34.699 --> 03:30:37.820]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for six months.
[03:30:37.820 --> 03:30:40.740]  It's very hard to produce and it's finally back in stock.
[03:30:40.740 --> 03:30:43.820]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[03:30:43.820 --> 03:30:46.020]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[03:30:46.020 --> 03:30:47.340]  You and your family need it.
[03:30:47.340 --> 03:30:49.539]  It's 25% off back in stock.

[03:30:53.860 --> 03:30:57.180]  Take action now, but regardless, research is info.
[03:30:57.180 --> 03:31:02.580]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food
[03:31:02.580 --> 03:31:03.939]  supply.
[03:31:03.939 --> 03:31:08.539]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which
[03:31:08.539 --> 03:31:12.860]  has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[03:31:12.860 --> 03:31:15.560]  There are two things we need to do about it.
[03:31:15.560 --> 03:31:18.900]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[03:31:18.900 --> 03:31:24.100]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally
[03:31:24.100 --> 03:31:27.460]  keep the soil rich with iodine.
[03:31:27.460 --> 03:31:33.500]  We need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day derived from ancient
[03:31:33.500 --> 03:31:37.779]  sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface.
[03:31:37.779 --> 03:31:43.619]  Our InfoWars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[03:31:43.619 --> 03:31:49.740]  Pure nascent iodine stabilized in an activated triiodine form.

[03:32:55.900 --> 03:33:05.900]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:06.000 --> 03:33:15.520]  Truly, truly shocking intel from the border.
[03:33:15.520 --> 03:33:20.720]  We're here with Lieutenant Colonel Pete Chambers, also known as Dr. Pete Chambers, and Christy
[03:33:20.720 --> 03:33:22.880]  Hutchison from Women Fighting for America.
[03:33:22.880 --> 03:33:31.280]  Dr. Pete, I want to ask you, is this on public land or historically military-owned land?
[03:33:31.280 --> 03:33:37.280]  Because these camps that they're bringing these military-age men to, they seem to be
[03:33:37.280 --> 03:33:38.280]  new facilities.
[03:33:38.280 --> 03:33:39.280]  Right.
[03:33:39.280 --> 03:33:43.840]  In this particular facility, and there's two places that we visited today, we visited the
[03:33:43.840 --> 03:33:50.240]  waterfront at Eagle Pass, which a waterfront typically under the POE is owned by the Immigration
[03:33:50.240 --> 03:33:54.280]  Custom to a certain degree and so many hundreds of meters in.
[03:33:54.280 --> 03:34:01.920]  But down about 8 miles, maybe 10 miles to the north in the border with Kenney County
[03:34:01.920 --> 03:34:07.280]  and Maverick County, yeah, that's where that camp is roughly located.
[03:34:07.280 --> 03:34:11.320]  So that is private land, it's probably leased to them.
[03:34:11.320 --> 03:34:14.720]  Now, I don't know, I didn't do the homework yet because we're just on this thing, but we'll
[03:34:14.720 --> 03:34:15.720]  figure it out.
[03:34:15.720 --> 03:34:20.880]  But we did, like I say, figure out who is on that contract that was moved up in the
[03:34:20.880 --> 03:34:24.240]  queue probably with their friend, The Borders Are.
[03:34:24.240 --> 03:34:29.520]  Yeah, well, I just had a quick look at deployedresources.com.
[03:34:29.520 --> 03:34:34.560]  It says that they stand ready to support emergency services, rapid deployment of temporary
[03:34:34.560 --> 03:34:40.640]  facilities and providing logistics management for government and commercial contracts.
[03:34:40.640 --> 03:34:44.440]  And you're saying, Dr. Pete, that this is directly connected to Kamala Harris.
[03:34:44.440 --> 03:34:46.160]  Do we have confirmation of that?
[03:34:46.160 --> 03:34:48.480]  No, I don't have confirmation of it.
[03:34:48.480 --> 03:34:51.880]  But I just know that in speaking to people in the contracting business, they know this
[03:34:51.880 --> 03:34:53.360]  company is doing that.
[03:34:53.360 --> 03:34:57.760]  And the other thing is this company, and typically, I've been in hurricane situations down in
[03:34:57.760 --> 03:35:03.380]  Harvey, Katrina, Rita, on the Gulf Coast, that this company is typically suited for
[03:35:03.380 --> 03:35:06.560]  more of a natural disaster type response.
[03:35:06.560 --> 03:35:08.280]  Now, that's where we've seen them.
[03:35:08.280 --> 03:35:12.080]  But I can only speculate as to what that connection.
[03:35:12.080 --> 03:35:17.600]  I am searching it on whitehouse.gov because there are contracts that are listed there.
[03:35:17.600 --> 03:35:18.600]  This all just happened.
[03:35:18.600 --> 03:35:19.600]  So we'll get to it.
[03:35:19.600 --> 03:35:22.240]  We'll find who is over that.
[03:35:22.240 --> 03:35:27.560]  But if she is over the border, and she's involved somehow, we'll figure it out.
[03:35:27.560 --> 03:35:28.560]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:35:28.560 --> 03:35:30.040]  I have no doubt.
[03:35:30.040 --> 03:35:33.840]  And I'll just say this is, for the viewers and the listeners right now, this is literally
[03:35:33.840 --> 03:35:37.280]  something that's developed in less than 24 hours.
[03:35:37.280 --> 03:35:42.200]  Just you know, we're catching up and really just finding out new things as we go.
[03:35:42.200 --> 03:35:43.200]  Chris, you do go on.
[03:35:43.200 --> 03:35:44.760]  You wanted to say something.
[03:35:45.080 --> 03:35:52.600]  Well, yeah, this company was awarded over $7 billion to facilitate and house these temporary
[03:35:52.600 --> 03:35:54.760]  type situations.
[03:35:54.760 --> 03:35:56.120]  So that's quite a lot of money.
[03:35:56.120 --> 03:35:59.520]  We're going to get to the bottom of it.
[03:35:59.520 --> 03:36:00.720]  That's a colossal amount of money.
[03:36:00.720 --> 03:36:01.720]  Okay.
[03:36:01.720 --> 03:36:06.520]  So just to be clear, there are no women or children that you've seen within these facilities?
[03:36:06.520 --> 03:36:07.520]  No.
[03:36:07.520 --> 03:36:12.680]  And I've spent three days out there filming and watching the comings and goings.
[03:36:12.680 --> 03:36:16.440]  And so far, it has all been the single young adult males.
[03:36:16.440 --> 03:36:21.080]  And I also got confirmation from a local law enforcement who put me on to this.
[03:36:21.080 --> 03:36:26.240]  I can't say his name for fear that there will be repercussions from him.
[03:36:26.240 --> 03:36:30.040]  But they're the ones who gave me the intel and said this is where they're taking the
[03:36:30.040 --> 03:36:32.240]  adult males.
[03:36:32.240 --> 03:36:34.320]  Right.
[03:36:34.320 --> 03:36:40.840]  I want to ask, actually, before I talk about the replacement migration that Michael Yon
[03:36:40.840 --> 03:36:45.480]  has been talking about, and I know that you have a lot to say about that, Dr. Pete, do
[03:36:45.480 --> 03:36:47.240]  we have signage around there?
[03:36:47.240 --> 03:36:52.440]  Is there military signage, National Guard, any military vehicles?
[03:36:52.440 --> 03:36:54.360]  Who's actually responsible for this?
[03:36:54.360 --> 03:36:55.360]  Right.
[03:36:55.360 --> 03:36:59.000]  This is still under now two separate entities.
[03:36:59.000 --> 03:37:03.440]  We have the river where the connexes are lined up, the 40-foot containers.
[03:37:03.440 --> 03:37:07.400]  That is being run by DPS as the lead, Department of Public Safety.
[03:37:07.400 --> 03:37:10.240]  That's our Texas state officials.
[03:37:10.240 --> 03:37:12.120]  And they are running the lead on that.
[03:37:12.120 --> 03:37:14.200]  They're utilizing the Texas National Guard.
[03:37:14.200 --> 03:37:15.640]  We did run into them on the border.
[03:37:15.640 --> 03:37:20.800]  They are stationed about every 300, 400 meters separated behind that wall that was created
[03:37:20.800 --> 03:37:22.600]  over the last 48 hours.
[03:37:22.600 --> 03:37:26.120]  Then the separate entities, Border Patrol, those are typically out there, and then ICE
[03:37:26.120 --> 03:37:29.120]  up on the bridge, you know, immigration custom officials.
[03:37:29.120 --> 03:37:31.360]  So you have those different federal versus that.
[03:37:31.360 --> 03:37:38.800]  But yes, Border Patrol, I'm sorry, DPS, troopers, and National Guard are working that operation
[03:37:38.800 --> 03:37:39.800]  there.
[03:37:40.360 --> 03:37:43.960]  So I have to commend Governor Abbott for doing that pretty quickly, regardless if it was
[03:37:43.960 --> 03:37:46.760]  secondary to Christie's report on the border.
[03:37:46.760 --> 03:37:47.760]  That's fine.
[03:37:47.760 --> 03:37:48.760]  Or it was just a coincidence.
[03:37:48.760 --> 03:37:51.080]  Not too many coincidences nowadays.
[03:37:51.080 --> 03:37:57.160]  Well, I was about to say that, you know, as soon as something explodes on social media,
[03:37:57.160 --> 03:37:59.080]  all of a sudden something's done about it.
[03:37:59.080 --> 03:38:03.680]  But this is why independent media is so crucial in your work, Christie, and again, the work
[03:38:03.680 --> 03:38:09.400]  of Women Fighting for America, very, very important to continue getting this information
[03:38:10.000 --> 03:38:15.040]  out there, because in a lot of respects, we thwart a lot of the plans by doing that.
[03:38:15.040 --> 03:38:19.800]  You know, people look at reports that come out before the fact, before something's happened,
[03:38:19.800 --> 03:38:21.240]  and then they say, well, it didn't happen.
[03:38:21.240 --> 03:38:26.160]  Yes, it didn't happen because the efforts were thwarted before they happened.
[03:38:26.160 --> 03:38:31.400]  So this is why this particular subject is so, so crucial, because we think that there
[03:38:31.400 --> 03:38:37.120]  may be something very, very sinister happening, especially with the cartel involvement, the
[03:38:37.120 --> 03:38:42.440]  two cartels meeting recently, as Alex was talking about, and Pete Santilli.
[03:38:42.440 --> 03:38:48.360]  I want to talk to you, Dr. Pete, about the Great Replacement, everything that Michael
[03:38:48.360 --> 03:38:49.880]  Yon's been exposing on the border.
[03:38:49.880 --> 03:38:52.040]  I know that you've been there for some time as well.
[03:38:52.040 --> 03:38:55.960]  So talk to us about some other observations that you've got on the ground and how you
[03:38:55.960 --> 03:39:01.760]  see this as really the Great Replacement or Replacement Migration, I should call it.
[03:39:01.760 --> 03:39:02.760]  Right.
[03:39:02.760 --> 03:39:05.880]  So we talk about the Clower-Piven Doctrine and things like that.
[03:39:05.960 --> 03:39:08.160]  Honestly, this goes further back.
[03:39:08.160 --> 03:39:12.920]  In the midst of chaos, that's when things can change, if we want to change.
[03:39:12.920 --> 03:39:14.120]  We create chaos.
[03:39:14.120 --> 03:39:17.080]  And so this was done in the Ukraine with Stalin.
[03:39:17.080 --> 03:39:21.640]  This was done in Europe post-ISIS attacking into Syria.
[03:39:21.640 --> 03:39:23.280]  This is being done on our border.
[03:39:23.280 --> 03:39:28.480]  When we push these numbers through and these poor people being used as pawns, but in the
[03:39:28.480 --> 03:39:34.680]  midst of those pawns comes, I call it the needle in the stack of needles, the fentanyl movers,
[03:39:34.680 --> 03:39:37.880]  the people moving weapons either north or south, money going south.
[03:39:37.880 --> 03:39:42.280]  You also have, obviously, the slave trade traffic which is going on.
[03:39:42.280 --> 03:39:46.040]  And so all this happens in the midst of this chaos as the system is overwhelmed.
[03:39:46.040 --> 03:39:47.600]  We can't control that.
[03:39:47.600 --> 03:39:54.880]  And that was an intentional Marxist technique, which then goes to the Clower-Piven Doctrine,
[03:39:54.880 --> 03:40:01.360]  which says overwhelm the system, create a serf class through handouts, through free
[03:40:01.360 --> 03:40:07.000]  cheese, if you will, and say, okay, now we can just survive and we'll be happy and we
[03:40:07.000 --> 03:40:08.000]  will own nothing.
[03:40:08.000 --> 03:40:09.960]  And where have we heard this before?
[03:40:09.960 --> 03:40:17.160]  So this is, to me, if you hear a hoof beat, you think about a horse and not a zebra.
[03:40:17.160 --> 03:40:18.160]  And here's the thing.
[03:40:18.160 --> 03:40:24.240]  I mean, all of these people from the left, and I really hate referring to the left and
[03:40:24.240 --> 03:40:28.280]  the right because it's really good and evil at this point.
[03:40:28.280 --> 03:40:33.240]  But all of these people from the left who are claiming that they care about these migrants
[03:40:33.240 --> 03:40:36.160]  and we should let more migrants in.
[03:40:36.160 --> 03:40:39.920]  Just recently I spoke about how they're doing this in Australia.
[03:40:39.920 --> 03:40:45.600]  It's much harder over here to invade like they are in the United States.
[03:40:45.600 --> 03:40:51.960]  But we have an influx of, they say, 700,000 new migrants by next year expected in our country.
[03:40:51.960 --> 03:40:56.920]  Now, that may not seem like a huge number, but with a population of about 26 million,
[03:40:56.920 --> 03:40:59.080]  it's pretty significant.
[03:40:59.080 --> 03:41:02.360]  And so, you know, this is happening worldwide.
[03:41:02.360 --> 03:41:04.680]  It's a United Nations strategy.
[03:41:04.680 --> 03:41:09.760]  You can Google the words replacement migration, United Nations.
[03:41:09.760 --> 03:41:11.840]  Everyone watching or listening can Google that right now.
[03:41:11.840 --> 03:41:12.840]  You will find it.
[03:41:12.840 --> 03:41:16.360]  They call it replacement migration.
[03:41:16.360 --> 03:41:19.120]  The agenda is in the name.
[03:41:19.120 --> 03:41:24.440]  So it's very, very clear what's going on here.
[03:41:24.440 --> 03:41:25.880]  Talk to us about what people are doing.
[03:41:25.880 --> 03:41:28.680]  I mean, are a lot of people there getting involved in this?
[03:41:28.680 --> 03:41:30.280]  Do more people need to be there?
[03:41:30.800 --> 03:41:38.199]  Yes, okay. I'm going to start, I'm going to kick this off. First of all, the humanitarian
[03:41:38.199 --> 03:41:45.679]  crisis is, I've seen it for the past couple of years, that using people to do really nefarious
[03:41:45.679 --> 03:41:51.240]  things, but also there's nothing humanitarian about a mom or a dad dropping a child over
[03:41:51.240 --> 03:41:55.560]  a wall. There's nothing humanitarian about a lady falling off a wall, breaking her neck
[03:41:55.560 --> 03:42:00.160]  and dying in some concertina wire, and somebody finding her body several days later. There's
[03:42:00.160 --> 03:42:05.119]  nothing humanitarian about torsos hanging upside down on the Mexican side because they
[03:42:05.119 --> 03:42:09.800]  refused to pay a tax to the cartels. With all these numbers comes the exploitation of
[03:42:09.800 --> 03:42:14.560]  these people, these simple people that want a better life. There's nothing wrong with that.
[03:42:14.560 --> 03:42:18.119]  But there is something wrong when you overwhelm the system and it can't handle it. It backs
[03:42:18.119 --> 03:42:21.800]  up and that's what this whole thing is doing on the humanitarian side.
[03:42:21.800 --> 03:42:28.720]  Maria, you know, I can share video and photographs. Some of them are pretty graphic to be displayed,
[03:42:28.720 --> 03:42:33.320]  so you would have to have definitely a disclaimer. But we've been to them. We call it the Mexican
[03:42:33.320 --> 03:42:37.800]  Highway. Me and my team have been doing this since two weeks into the Biden administration.
[03:42:37.800 --> 03:42:43.119]  And you know, the Mexican Highway is where it's a pretty tough terrain. It's typically
[03:42:43.119 --> 03:42:46.119]  in the middle of where there's not a lot of law enforcement or Border Patrol activity.
[03:42:46.119 --> 03:42:51.080]  Hang on, Christy. We've got to go to break. We've got to go to break. I really want you
[03:42:51.080 --> 03:42:54.320]  to continue this on the other side of the break. Don't go anywhere. This is crucial
[03:42:54.320 --> 03:42:56.320]  information. We'll be right back.
[03:43:25.320 --> 03:43:31.759]  These are fluoride-free, next-level toothpaste. 10,000 of each tube, limited run, available

[03:43:56.759 --> 03:44:01.599]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mug shot, because
[03:44:01.599 --> 03:44:05.920]  they knew that that would help Trump. Didn't they know this would backfire? We were waiting
[03:44:05.920 --> 03:44:10.039]  for the mug shot. We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own. And it says
[03:44:10.039 --> 03:44:16.880]  political prisoner with an image of President Trump. The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[03:44:16.880 --> 03:44:22.279]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week. Political Prisoner with Trump on the front
[03:44:22.279 --> 03:44:28.800]  there in a mug shot. Jail background. It's a fundraiser shirt. It says InfoWars.com on
[03:44:28.800 --> 03:44:33.400]  the back of the shirt. We also have Alex Jones for President. No, I'm not running for President.
[03:44:33.400 --> 03:44:37.039]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt. Red, white, and blue. Alex Jones for

[03:44:57.880 --> 03:45:03.279]  your time. Please write this down and please go look this up. It will change your life.
[03:45:03.279 --> 03:45:07.759]  The UN admits, and the Lansing Medical Journal admits, that upwards of two billion people
[03:45:07.759 --> 03:45:14.119]  have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities. The term they use is intellectual
[03:45:14.119 --> 03:45:20.560]  disability because of lack of iodine. Most iodine in the environment is bound to other
[03:45:20.560 --> 03:45:26.560]  elements so your body can't absorb it. Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into
[03:45:26.560 --> 03:45:33.240]  the cells. And InfoWarsStore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type
[03:45:33.240 --> 03:45:38.160]  of full effect. Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for six months. It's very hard
[03:45:38.160 --> 03:45:42.480]  to produce and it's finally back in stock. In fact, I was just taking some before I shot
[03:45:42.480 --> 03:45:48.080]  this ad. This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful. You and your family need it. It's 25% off
[03:45:48.080 --> 03:45:55.320]  back in stock. X3 triiodine exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com. Take action now, but regardless,
[03:45:55.320 --> 03:46:02.039]  research is info. Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth. And
[03:46:02.039 --> 03:46:09.160]  they've got our children drinking that. This is a psychotic death cult. Period. Case closed.
[03:46:09.160 --> 03:46:14.160]  Out to get you and your family. We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze, made by the MyPatriotSupply
[03:46:14.160 --> 03:46:18.199]  Ready Hour group. It's been around about 15 years. Became the biggest company in the last
[03:46:18.199 --> 03:46:22.840]  six. They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system
[03:46:22.840 --> 03:46:28.320]  out there that sells for twice the price. And they made it as good in all the studies.
[03:46:28.320 --> 03:46:32.000]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals. But you can go pay
[03:46:32.000 --> 03:46:35.880]  two or three times. There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good. We
[03:46:35.880 --> 03:46:41.119]  sell the very best, highest grade water filtration system for half the price of the leading competitor.
[03:46:41.119 --> 03:46:46.519]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[03:46:46.519 --> 03:46:49.880]  You should also filter your shower water. That's another way you absorb this crap. But
[03:46:49.880 --> 03:46:54.000]  I'm done talking about that. The point is you can get the filters at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:46:54.000 --> 03:46:58.679]  They're discounted right now. Finally back in stock.
[03:46:58.679 --> 03:47:04.560]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[03:47:06.000 --> 03:47:18.080]  Just before the break we were discussing here how the left, or what I like to call just the
[03:47:18.080 --> 03:47:22.320]  evil side in general, claims that they care about these migrants and yes, let's bring
[03:47:22.320 --> 03:47:28.160]  more in, we've got plenty of room, but really are just completely unaware what is past the
[03:47:28.160 --> 03:47:32.800]  virtue signalling on the surface of claiming to care about people, claiming that this is
[03:47:32.800 --> 03:47:34.520]  a humanitarian effort.
[03:47:34.520 --> 03:47:37.920]  Just over the break, Christy, who's with us now, sent me some pictures which I haven't
[03:47:37.920 --> 03:47:43.280]  been able to send to the team in time, but it's absolutely shocking, you know, and I
[03:47:43.280 --> 03:47:48.040]  mean I don't even know if we could air these pictures, they're so grotesque, Christy, go
[03:47:48.040 --> 03:47:52.360]  on and please tell us what you've been seeing over the time that you've been covering this.
[03:47:52.400 --> 03:48:02.240]  I think we've lost your sound there, or can I just not hear?
[03:48:02.240 --> 03:48:03.240]  Can you hear me?
[03:48:03.240 --> 03:48:04.240]  Yes, we can.
[03:48:04.240 --> 03:48:05.240]  You're back on.
[03:48:05.240 --> 03:48:06.240]  Okay, perfect.
[03:48:06.240 --> 03:48:10.640]  So, from the humanitarian perspective, the things that we've witnessed in the last two
[03:48:10.640 --> 03:48:16.160]  plus years since Biden decided to open up the borders, I have seen the dead bodies.
[03:48:16.160 --> 03:48:20.600]  I was just now showing Maria and sending her some of those photographs.
[03:48:20.600 --> 03:48:23.680]  We've been up to what I was talking about is the Mexican Highway.
[03:48:23.680 --> 03:48:29.960]  So these are particular areas where the coyotes will usher in women and children who are earmarked
[03:48:29.960 --> 03:48:33.840]  and already sold to buyers in the United States of America.
[03:48:33.840 --> 03:48:37.480]  And those, they track them up in areas where they don't want to get caught.
[03:48:37.480 --> 03:48:39.320]  And then there's these staging grounds.
[03:48:39.320 --> 03:48:41.480]  They're very difficult to get up to some of these places.
[03:48:41.480 --> 03:48:45.080]  Me and my team takes us sometimes an hour and a half to two hours to hike up to these
[03:48:45.080 --> 03:48:46.140]  locations.
[03:48:46.140 --> 03:48:50.060]  And that's where you'll find the remnants of the rape trees where, and I'm going to show
[03:48:50.060 --> 03:48:51.740]  you really quick what a rape tree looks like.
[03:48:51.740 --> 03:48:55.300]  I won't show the other graphic pictures, but this is for your audience.
[03:48:55.300 --> 03:48:58.060]  This is just one of what a rape tree looks like.
[03:48:58.060 --> 03:49:00.740]  You'll see the shackles buckle to the trees.
[03:49:00.740 --> 03:49:06.160]  They take ropes or chains and they tie them through those shackles and they tie the women
[03:49:06.160 --> 03:49:08.820]  and children down to the ground.
[03:49:08.820 --> 03:49:12.100]  And then they violently, repetitively gang rape them.
[03:49:12.100 --> 03:49:17.660]  When they're done, I will show you and send you some of the other aftermath pictures.
[03:49:17.660 --> 03:49:21.699]  They then take their bras and their panties and they throw them up into the tree and it's
[03:49:21.699 --> 03:49:23.020]  a trophy.
[03:49:23.020 --> 03:49:27.140]  And that signals to the next group that will be bringing in, this is how many women and
[03:49:27.140 --> 03:49:30.060]  children we got to rape into submission.
[03:49:30.060 --> 03:49:33.020]  And then we've actually captured coyotes phones.
[03:49:33.020 --> 03:49:37.380]  We've downloaded them to the buyers throughout the United States of America.
[03:49:37.380 --> 03:49:41.220]  They are then taken down to the side of the road and the highway where they're put on
[03:49:41.220 --> 03:49:46.140]  transport and then they're shipped to their different locations all the way as far as
[03:49:46.220 --> 03:49:48.260]  Baltimore, New York, Ohio.
[03:49:48.260 --> 03:49:50.100]  We've seen almost every single state.
[03:49:51.539 --> 03:49:56.820]  But that is, I mean, I'm sick, I feel sick to my stomach, Christy.
[03:49:56.820 --> 03:50:03.340]  This is just, you know, where are all the people talking about humanitarianism now?
[03:50:03.340 --> 03:50:10.020]  Where are all the people actually fighting for basic human rights for these people, you
[03:50:10.020 --> 03:50:12.820]  know, who are saying, yes, bring more in, bring more in?
[03:50:12.900 --> 03:50:14.699]  Are you aware that this is happening?
[03:50:14.699 --> 03:50:17.100]  Are you aware of of the rape trees?
[03:50:17.100 --> 03:50:23.460]  I mean, this is just this is absolutely shocking to me that this, you know, this is what
[03:50:23.460 --> 03:50:25.460]  should be in the mainstream media.
[03:50:25.580 --> 03:50:31.900]  The fact that there are camps where military aged men are being brought illegally, the
[03:50:31.900 --> 03:50:35.900]  fact that women and children are being mistreated like this, this is what the mainstream
[03:50:35.900 --> 03:50:39.900]  media needs to see. I wonder how the left would respond if they saw that.
[03:50:41.300 --> 03:50:43.900]  Well, you know, it doesn't fit into their narrative, does it, Maria?
[03:50:43.900 --> 03:50:44.940]  This is political.
[03:50:44.940 --> 03:50:50.220]  This is not about the safety and security of not only American citizens.
[03:50:50.380 --> 03:50:54.500]  This is not about the safety and security of the illegals trying to come up for a better
[03:50:54.500 --> 03:50:58.500]  way of life. This is an agenda driven mission, period.
[03:50:58.779 --> 03:51:02.940]  And, you know, me and my team, there's some of the things that I can't even describe to
[03:51:02.940 --> 03:51:07.619]  you what we've seen. Some of the footage we have little babies decapitated, their
[03:51:07.619 --> 03:51:12.380]  bodies thrown on the side of the banks of the river, men being gutted where their organs
[03:51:12.380 --> 03:51:16.220]  are literally laying out on the side because they didn't pay the cartel.
[03:51:16.699 --> 03:51:21.420]  This is time and time again, a woman who fell to her death and entangled in the barbed
[03:51:21.420 --> 03:51:26.180]  wire because her husband and the coyotes were bringing her over the fence.
[03:51:26.420 --> 03:51:31.460]  This goes on all up and down the border, let alone the bodies that are strewn through
[03:51:31.460 --> 03:51:34.539]  the desert or on Texas ranchers property.
[03:51:34.699 --> 03:51:38.140]  And they can't even bury them anymore because it's overwhelming the system.
[03:51:38.460 --> 03:51:40.779]  This is what they don't want the American people to know.
[03:51:40.980 --> 03:51:42.740]  And we have got to get this out there.
[03:51:42.859 --> 03:51:48.699]  And again, I have no problem sharing the footage with InfoWars because this is
[03:51:48.699 --> 03:51:52.220]  truth. Video doesn't lie and photographs do not lie.
[03:51:53.900 --> 03:51:59.619]  Well, I agree with you that everyone needs to know about this and I'm asking whoever's
[03:51:59.619 --> 03:52:06.100]  watching or listening to go back onto Band.Video or MadMaxWorld.TV, find
[03:52:06.100 --> 03:52:08.900]  this, share it everywhere, make this interview viral.
[03:52:09.420 --> 03:52:12.619]  And then I want to talk about where people can find more of your work, Christy.
[03:52:12.619 --> 03:52:17.340]  But before we do that, Lieutenant Colonel Chambers, I always ask you every single time
[03:52:17.340 --> 03:52:23.340]  you and I interview, because you are a military man and you think like a military
[03:52:23.340 --> 03:52:27.260]  man, which is what is needed as we are clearly at war.
[03:52:27.500 --> 03:52:32.140]  The globalists have waged war against the people of the world, innocent people of the
[03:52:32.140 --> 03:52:35.699]  world. It's not a war that can be seen on the surface.
[03:52:36.100 --> 03:52:40.779]  But those who are aware that it's happening know, what do people need to know now, now
[03:52:40.779 --> 03:52:42.060]  that they have this information?
[03:52:42.060 --> 03:52:43.140]  What do they need to do?
[03:52:44.619 --> 03:52:49.699]  What they need to do is understand that we, the people, are going to pull through this.
[03:52:49.699 --> 03:52:52.420]  I may be wearing a white hat, but there are no white hats.
[03:52:52.740 --> 03:52:54.100]  We've got to stop with that facade.
[03:52:54.580 --> 03:52:58.220]  The other thing is we've got to stop trusting legislators when they talk about Title 42
[03:52:58.220 --> 03:52:59.500]  and Title 8 and Title this.
[03:52:59.900 --> 03:53:00.900]  Those are shell games.
[03:53:00.900 --> 03:53:05.380]  Those shell games are used to keep us placated and discussing these things in Hegelian
[03:53:05.460 --> 03:53:10.900]  dialectics. So this is an information war, info wars, as the show says, and this is an
[03:53:10.900 --> 03:53:15.300]  information war. But it has second and third order effects, which are these humanitarian
[03:53:15.300 --> 03:53:20.220]  crises, which are the overwhelming of the system, which they'll eventually lead to a
[03:53:20.220 --> 03:53:22.260]  collapse of the system as we know it.
[03:53:22.380 --> 03:53:25.300]  And maybe that perhaps is what it's going to take to wake people up.
[03:53:25.500 --> 03:53:26.740]  Well, we don't want to get there.
[03:53:27.100 --> 03:53:29.300]  We don't want to go to the most dangerous course of action.
[03:53:29.500 --> 03:53:33.980]  We want to be somewhere in between what's happening right now and us stopping it with
[03:53:33.980 --> 03:53:36.020]  we the people. That's why we have to get together.
[03:53:36.020 --> 03:53:38.580]  And this is this is our warfare right now.
[03:53:38.580 --> 03:53:42.740]  The sword of truth. If you believe in the Bible, you know that the Bible is the word and
[03:53:42.740 --> 03:53:44.180]  the word is a double edged sword.
[03:53:44.340 --> 03:53:48.500]  And the only thing that we can do is we can we can look at that book and we can figure out
[03:53:48.500 --> 03:53:50.660]  as a field manual what we need to do.
[03:53:50.660 --> 03:53:52.260]  And first of all, we operate out of love.
[03:53:52.460 --> 03:53:55.220]  But there is such a time for righteous anger and it's coming.
[03:53:55.420 --> 03:53:57.580]  And anger is his say of the Lord.
[03:53:57.859 --> 03:54:00.660]  But we've got to be the eyes and ears right now.
[03:54:00.660 --> 03:54:03.980]  And we need every person to step up and work together in this.
[03:54:05.060 --> 03:54:06.740]  Yeah, overwhelmingly.
[03:54:07.060 --> 03:54:10.500]  Oh, sorry, Christie, you go and then I want to I want to offer my my thoughts on this.
[03:54:11.619 --> 03:54:16.740]  Yeah, I agree with Lieutenant Colonel Chambers, you know, when you look at even the
[03:54:16.740 --> 03:54:20.820]  sheriffs, there's also a coordinated effort when you think about what they're doing.
[03:54:21.260 --> 03:54:26.180]  They're actually coaching the illegals who now are coming over and they're they're
[03:54:26.460 --> 03:54:29.260]  asking them to literally withdraw their asylum.
[03:54:29.580 --> 03:54:33.900]  So and then telling them to go back over into Mexico, go through the port of entry and
[03:54:33.900 --> 03:54:39.380]  enter through that way so they can have this invasion continue, because if they cross
[03:54:39.380 --> 03:54:42.900]  the river, they ask for asylum, they will not qualify.
[03:54:43.060 --> 03:54:48.539]  So our own our own border patrol has been told from the top to tell them to withdraw
[03:54:48.539 --> 03:54:51.980]  their asylum, go back over the border and go through the ports of entry.
[03:54:52.060 --> 03:54:54.460]  America, we are under an attack.
[03:54:54.460 --> 03:54:58.580]  This is an invasion. And I know Pete and I both have some very specific instructions that
[03:54:58.580 --> 03:54:59.859]  we want your listeners to do.
[03:55:00.020 --> 03:55:03.100]  And I'm going to give you a course of action because we're not we're an action kind of
[03:55:03.100 --> 03:55:06.740]  group. And we want to tell you what you can do to change the course of history.
[03:55:08.100 --> 03:55:09.619]  Yes, yes, absolutely.
[03:55:09.619 --> 03:55:13.619]  Well, we've got about two and a half minutes, Christie, if you want to say anything else on
[03:55:13.619 --> 03:55:17.859]  that, and then I really want people to know where they can find out more from women
[03:55:17.859 --> 03:55:20.619]  fighting for America and also follow you, Dr.
[03:55:20.619 --> 03:55:27.300]  Pete. So first and foremost, if you are a retired law enforcement officer or military
[03:55:27.300 --> 03:55:31.300]  and you have time on your hands or you're just simply are in that category and you have
[03:55:31.300 --> 03:55:36.380]  some time on your hands, I want you to write this email down that VET contact at
[03:55:36.380 --> 03:55:37.619]  ProtonMail.com.
[03:55:37.619 --> 03:55:40.300]  That's VET contact at ProtonMail.com.
[03:55:40.539 --> 03:55:41.619]  Please send us a message.
[03:55:41.619 --> 03:55:42.660]  We will get back with you.
[03:55:43.180 --> 03:55:46.020]  We have something very specific we want to have you do.
[03:55:46.300 --> 03:55:52.380]  Second of all, go to WFFA.WIN, W-F-F-A dot W-I-N.
[03:55:52.619 --> 03:55:53.699]  You can follow us.
[03:55:53.980 --> 03:55:55.100]  It is important work we do.
[03:55:55.100 --> 03:55:59.220]  We need your time, talents and treasures to keep us out here uncovering the truth.
[03:55:59.220 --> 03:56:02.900]  We can't do it without your partnership because we're all in this together.
[03:56:03.020 --> 03:56:05.020]  We, the people, are the solution and the answer.
[03:56:05.260 --> 03:56:10.180]  We're going to be coming to a town near you, training you how to geofence your home and your
[03:56:10.180 --> 03:56:14.940]  community and telling you what you need to do for the coming war that's going to be on our
[03:56:14.940 --> 03:56:15.859]  soil very soon.
[03:56:16.859 --> 03:56:22.020]  Well, that's a very sobering and necessary words, Christy.
[03:56:22.460 --> 03:56:26.539]  Lieutenant Colonel Chambers, where can people follow you, your work and find out more about
[03:56:26.539 --> 03:56:27.060]  what you're doing?
[03:56:28.619 --> 03:56:29.460]  There's my dog in the background.
[03:56:29.660 --> 03:56:34.220]  So, DrDrPeteChambers.com, that's my lines of effort page.
[03:56:34.460 --> 03:56:37.340]  People get on there, we share things, we go back and forth.
[03:56:37.340 --> 03:56:42.699]  I improve it pretty much weekly now and that's where I can get information out if you want to
[03:56:43.020 --> 03:56:47.260]  follow that or go to that, that will help, but also contact me through that page and give me any
[03:56:47.260 --> 03:56:47.779]  updates.
[03:56:49.539 --> 03:56:51.460]  Well, I really appreciate both of you.
[03:56:52.140 --> 03:56:52.660]  Thank you.
[03:56:53.220 --> 03:56:57.220]  Just know you are the eyes and ear, you are the heartbeat of our nation.
[03:56:57.420 --> 03:57:01.460]  If you see something, say something, send us information, we will investigate it.
[03:57:03.220 --> 03:57:06.820]  Absolutely, I really appreciate the both of you coming on today, all the work that you're both
[03:57:06.820 --> 03:57:11.699]  doing. DrPete is a personal friend of mine, a dear friend and a friend of mine, and we're going to
[03:57:11.699 --> 03:57:12.539]  get through this together.
[03:57:12.539 --> 03:57:18.779]  And I just think that the that overwhelmingly the heart of people to see a win, the heart of
[03:57:18.779 --> 03:57:23.860]  people to stand together as humanity and preserve humanity is just so strong.
[03:57:24.060 --> 03:57:29.860]  And there's no giving up, there's no giving up in the people of the resistance.
[03:57:30.220 --> 03:57:31.100]  Can you see it?
[03:57:31.260 --> 03:57:32.619]  Can you feel it, people?
[03:57:32.820 --> 03:57:36.220]  It is coming the right way.
[03:57:36.420 --> 03:57:38.220]  Justice is coming the right way.
[03:57:38.260 --> 03:57:39.220]  We will never give up.
[03:57:39.220 --> 03:57:42.340]  God bless you both, and I'll see everyone very, very soon.
[03:57:42.340 --> 03:57:43.619]  Thank you for joining us today.
[03:57:43.619 --> 03:57:44.380]  Share this everywhere.
[03:57:45.500 --> 03:57:52.500]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[03:57:52.500 --> 03:57:55.500]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[03:57:55.500 --> 03:57:57.500]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[03:57:57.500 --> 03:58:00.500]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[03:58:00.500 --> 03:58:03.500]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[03:58:03.500 --> 03:58:05.500]  It's the same thing with Infowars.
[03:58:05.500 --> 03:58:11.500]  But Infowars is not owned by Fox, or controlled by George Soros, or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[03:58:11.500 --> 03:58:14.500]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[03:58:14.500 --> 03:58:17.500]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[03:58:17.500 --> 03:58:22.500]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[03:58:22.500 --> 03:58:25.500]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[03:58:25.500 --> 03:58:28.500]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand.
[03:58:28.500 --> 03:58:31.500]  Please don't take Infowars for granted.
[03:58:31.500 --> 03:58:33.500]  We're barely hanging on.
[03:58:33.500 --> 03:58:38.500]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support, while getting great products at the same time at Infowars.com.
[03:58:38.500 --> 03:58:40.500]  So don't procrastinate.
[03:58:40.500 --> 03:58:45.500]  Go to Infowars.com, get amazing products that keep us on the air, and never submit to these tyrants.
[03:58:45.500 --> 03:58:51.500]  Every time I talk to you, you're either like on the border exposing the cartels and like coming under fire.
[03:58:51.500 --> 03:58:55.500]  Or you're on the streets of some American city hanging out with drug addicts and criminals.
[03:58:55.500 --> 03:58:58.500]  And now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill.
[03:58:58.500 --> 03:59:00.500]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah?
[03:59:00.500 --> 03:59:02.500]  Have you ever considered that for a second?
[03:59:02.500 --> 03:59:05.500]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans.
[03:59:05.500 --> 03:59:07.500]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth.
[03:59:07.500 --> 03:59:09.500]  And again, you know, I have Infowars to thank for that.
[03:59:09.500 --> 03:59:13.500]  Looking back on the day I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions.
[03:59:13.500 --> 03:59:19.500]  I was so grateful because, you know, I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and under the Infowars team.
[03:59:19.500 --> 03:59:24.500]  And I really do credit that as to why I'm able to, you know, get these types of clips.
[03:59:24.500 --> 03:59:28.500]  Because Alex's whole mentality was, you know, go where the story is.
[03:59:28.500 --> 03:59:31.500]  Go where the mainstream media refuses to.
[03:59:31.500 --> 03:59:33.500]  So it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity.
[03:59:33.500 --> 03:59:36.500]  I'm just addicted to telling the truth and helping the American people.
[03:59:36.500 --> 03:59:41.500]  And I really do credit Alex for, you know, really instilling that within me early on in my career.
