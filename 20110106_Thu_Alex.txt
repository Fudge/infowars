[00:00.000 --> 00:11.980]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:11.980 --> 00:30.380]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:30.380 --> 00:39.220]  it is Thursday the 6th day of January 2011 in the fourth hour today we're gonna
[00:39.220 --> 00:44.740]  have Pierce Corbin of Weather Action a meteorologist who has a much more
[00:44.740 --> 00:53.580]  accurate long-term prediction accuracy than a mainline meteorologist and the
[00:53.580 --> 01:05.020]  climate tax fear mongering authoritarians who are using the rescue the
[01:05.020 --> 01:10.260]  environment movement as a pretext to bring in an authoritarian surveillance
[01:10.260 --> 01:16.060]  system he's going to be joining us today because in England and the United
[01:16.060 --> 01:22.100]  States the press is having to admit that Mr. Corbin was absolutely right a year
[01:22.100 --> 01:28.820]  ago when he said that 2010-2011 would be an incredibly cold winter and he
[01:28.820 --> 01:34.660]  predicted that for the previous winter 2009 into 2010 he'll be joining
[01:34.660 --> 01:40.860]  us coming up in the fourth hour today Alan Watt will be joining us in the
[01:40.860 --> 01:47.380]  third hour today to go over the latest news and developments on a host a host
[01:47.380 --> 01:55.500]  of important issues coming up in 30 minutes I'm going to break down some
[01:55.500 --> 02:00.540]  very important information dealing with the nature of the New World Order the
[02:00.540 --> 02:08.180]  scientific dictatorship and their plan to complete this dystopic system that
[02:08.180 --> 02:13.020]  they've been constructing right now they're very busy branding dystopia as
[02:13.020 --> 02:21.060]  good as 1984 as good that murdering children blowing them up if they don't
[02:21.060 --> 02:27.100]  submit to carbon taxes as good it's the Overton window where they are
[02:27.100 --> 02:31.980]  conditioning people with with with with mainline news and media promoting
[02:31.980 --> 02:37.140]  outrageously insane things knowing that most people are peer pressure driven
[02:37.140 --> 02:41.860]  don't have original thoughts in their head and just like with the Aztecs hey
[02:41.860 --> 02:46.900]  our government says we sacrifice children and then eat them or the Babylonians
[02:46.900 --> 02:53.300]  similar things or the Canaanites or the ancient druids same system and really
[02:53.300 --> 02:58.660]  it's the psychopaths on top testing their total power their total control so
[02:58.660 --> 03:03.140]  that when they say jump you say how high and so they're just coming right out
[03:03.140 --> 03:08.540]  with amazing amazing statements Paul Watson has an article on it planned
[03:08.540 --> 03:14.380]  opolis a lead us agenda for eco enslavement and we're gonna play this
[03:14.380 --> 03:20.900]  government funded they're also team up the London Guardian production where you
[03:20.900 --> 03:25.420]  think it's a joke I mean they're talking about total surveillance total
[03:25.420 --> 03:31.780]  rationing lockdown cities prison grid which is the official UN plan you
[03:31.780 --> 03:35.020]  notice that's in many of my films for over 15 years I've been talking about
[03:35.020 --> 03:40.460]  it because I'm reading their own plans but this is going from the academic into
[03:40.460 --> 03:46.780]  the smart growth publicly where they're saying total tyranny is good and you
[03:46.780 --> 03:52.900]  watch it and it seems like some type of dystopic money python episode or Brazil
[03:52.900 --> 04:03.380]  or 1984 but it's not or or Gadica or Brave New World this is what they're
[04:03.380 --> 04:07.740]  really pushing and so now they're laying it all out how wonderful we're gonna
[04:07.740 --> 04:11.740]  murder you if you don't submit oh you don't want to submit the carbon tax is
[04:11.740 --> 04:16.180]  fine hits the button blows the children up when you watch this video and hear the
[04:16.180 --> 04:19.700]  audio that's coming up it's gonna blow you away I'm gonna analyze that and I'm
[04:19.700 --> 04:24.380]  gonna play a clip of in the game just three minutes in after the intro of the
[04:24.380 --> 04:29.900]  film the first several minutes of the film proper where I lay out exactly what
[04:29.900 --> 04:35.380]  they say but I'm saying it's bad they're saying it's good and I'm gonna play
[04:35.380 --> 04:40.700]  their clip to get an idea of this will also queue up the commercial that they're
[04:40.700 --> 04:44.980]  airing in movie theaters where it shows the schoolteacher murdering small
[04:44.980 --> 04:49.900]  children and this is hailed as good and see then the general public only follows
[04:49.900 --> 04:53.660]  fans the new style is murdering children they go you're such an extremist you

[05:55.420 --> 06:02.140]  number 1-800-409-5633 this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[06:02.140 --> 06:06.580]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[06:06.580 --> 06:10.620]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[06:10.620 --> 06:14.500]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[06:14.500 --> 06:18.500]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[06:18.500 --> 06:23.060]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[06:23.060 --> 06:27.060]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[06:27.060 --> 06:30.860]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[06:30.860 --> 06:34.500]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[06:34.500 --> 06:38.860]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[06:38.860 --> 06:41.980]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[06:41.980 --> 06:45.700]  generators offered by Solutions from Science one of my oldest sponsors you

[07:56.060 --> 08:02.780]  star soap.com thank you Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly
[08:02.780 --> 08:20.220]  presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[08:20.220 --> 08:24.660]  we've got Alan Watt joining us coming up about an hour and 52 minutes from now then we'll go
[08:24.660 --> 08:28.820]  into overdrive with the fourth hour with Pierce Corbin meteorologist who's
[08:28.820 --> 08:33.620]  getting his due and Main Street media from Europe to the United States is
[08:33.620 --> 08:39.340]  admitting that he has stunning accuracy when compared to mainline meteorologist
[08:39.340 --> 08:46.620]  and he follows the ancient systems of the moon the ancients didn't know why
[08:46.620 --> 08:52.060]  weather was so closely associated with the moon they just knew it was and now
[08:52.060 --> 08:57.980]  we know that a lot of our weather one of the big inputs one of the largest most
[08:57.980 --> 09:03.220]  important inputs is solar winds the different ions the different particles
[09:03.220 --> 09:09.340]  the micro meteorites all of it coming in out of the solar winds over the earth
[09:09.340 --> 09:14.020]  and its magnetic field and that when the moon is between the earth and the sun or
[09:14.020 --> 09:18.740]  not between the earth and the sun it has a massive effect on what's coming into
[09:18.740 --> 09:26.140]  the atmosphere then one of the other big feeds or inputs is the magnetics of the
[09:26.140 --> 09:31.700]  planet from the core affecting weather on the surface because of the massive
[09:31.700 --> 09:38.900]  magnetic tectonic type energies being released now mainline give up your
[09:38.900 --> 09:42.220]  property for the earth give everything to Al Gore give everything to global
[09:42.220 --> 09:46.740]  government collectivize everything they tell you that has nothing to do with it
[09:46.740 --> 09:52.740]  okay that's mainline meteorology now all the other sciences they know that people
[09:52.740 --> 09:57.140]  that study the sun and the moon and people that study that the tectonic and
[09:57.140 --> 10:01.540]  magnetic forces that's all well-known but these sciences are all very
[10:01.540 --> 10:06.780]  compartmentalized and they they tend to only stick with whatever the original
[10:06.780 --> 10:12.180]  accepted ancient theories are and so they stick with that and it's pretty
[10:12.180 --> 10:17.860]  ridiculous I did want to cover a couple of notes here because time gets away from
[10:17.860 --> 10:24.740]  me and I don't tend to cover it I learned late last week that Aaron
[10:24.740 --> 10:28.980]  gelman of Jews the preservation of firearms ownership had passed and I
[10:28.980 --> 10:34.660]  wanted to properly eulogize him and hopefully later today I'll have time to
[10:34.660 --> 10:40.780]  read this article from Illinois gun posted at info wars.com on December 31st
[10:40.780 --> 10:47.020]  last Friday second amendment champion Aaron Zellman passes and he did so much
[10:47.020 --> 10:51.620]  great work with his organization that will continue on for the second
[10:51.620 --> 10:56.180]  amendment he was a great guy one of our favorite guest on the second amendment
[10:56.180 --> 11:05.820]  very informed a real attack dog against the gun grabbers at the BATF and the
[11:05.820 --> 11:09.740]  southern private law center in ADL he really went after those guys and he will
[11:09.740 --> 11:13.540]  be certainly missed in a real real warrior for liberty has passed but
[11:13.540 --> 11:16.700]  certainly he passes on the torch to all of us that will continue to carry on
[11:16.700 --> 11:20.980]  the fight for human liberty and not to be disarmed and be brought into the place
[11:20.980 --> 11:26.140]  of total slaves and of course we will continue on in the fight for the second
[11:26.140 --> 11:33.860]  amendment but he did die and then it wasn't publicly put out until late
[11:33.860 --> 11:40.980]  December he was buried on the 24th but an obituary didn't appear and stuff
[11:40.980 --> 11:46.020]  didn't come out until the 30th we discovered it the 31st and the article
[11:46.020 --> 11:53.860]  second amendment champion Aaron Zellman passes so he certainly was a shock I had
[11:53.860 --> 11:58.940]  a you know paying in me whenever I discovered that information because it
[11:58.940 --> 12:03.860]  also just illustrates how short life is and you think people you know that
[12:03.860 --> 12:07.740]  you've known are gonna be around forever and then they just die another issue was
[12:07.740 --> 12:11.180]  I interviewed him just a few months before he died and he didn't tell
[12:11.180 --> 12:16.380]  anybody that he was so ill that's another issue so kind of the old-fashioned
[12:16.380 --> 12:20.660]  type guy that doesn't you know let anybody know what's going on with his
[12:20.660 --> 12:28.620]  health so he's gone but will not be forgotten a month or so ago I sent the
[12:28.620 --> 12:33.180]  crew up to Maine to interview Charlotte Isherby about the government's
[12:33.180 --> 12:38.980]  deliberate premeditated destruction of free speech and of course once they were
[12:38.980 --> 12:42.700]  up there after the interview ended she got into skull and bones she got into a
[12:42.700 --> 12:46.220]  whole bunch of issues that her father and grandfather had been involved in and
[12:46.220 --> 12:51.460]  also her father's visit with Bohemian Grove and I dispatched the guys back
[12:51.460 --> 12:55.500]  there and they interviewed her again yesterday to get that data so we can put
[12:55.500 --> 12:59.740]  it on prisonplanet.tv for the members and also condense it down into an
[12:59.740 --> 13:04.460]  upcoming film and she gave us a gift Charlotte Isherby gave us a gift you
[13:04.460 --> 13:07.180]  know we're really interviewing her a lot because she's gonna she's 80 years
[13:07.180 --> 13:11.820]  old now and it's pretty much gonna ride off into the sunset at least for the
[13:11.820 --> 13:16.300]  foreseeable future and so we're ensuring that that information is archived
[13:16.300 --> 13:21.300]  and prominently forwarded to the current generation and the future
[13:21.300 --> 13:25.360]  generations because she was the head of policy number two overall at the
[13:25.360 --> 13:29.220]  Department of Education under Reagan and it was just openly discussed in the
[13:29.220 --> 13:32.540]  bureaucracy that they are training people to not be able to think and
[13:32.540 --> 13:36.660]  dubbing people down and of course when she talked about it 20 years ago she
[13:36.660 --> 13:40.220]  got laughed at even though she had the documents now it's such mainstream news
[13:40.220 --> 13:46.060]  and information but she gave us a little gift here and I guess if I can
[13:46.060 --> 13:51.620]  decorate my office with this we'll scan this in and write a little blurb about
[13:51.620 --> 13:55.420]  it in the next few days and put it up on info wars.com and prisonbonnet.com
[13:55.420 --> 14:00.140]  but if you are a prisonplanet.tv viewer you can see it right now it's a main
[14:00.140 --> 14:08.740]  license plate and it's a white license plate with a evergreen pine tree and a
[14:08.740 --> 14:13.540]  forest in the background and it's a main license plate she had a few years ago
[14:13.540 --> 14:19.580]  it says Ron Paul vacation land but she was able to get the license plate Ron
[14:19.580 --> 14:25.540]  Paul and she made the joke that once the Mayak report came out saying that if
[14:25.540 --> 14:29.060]  you have a Ron Paul bumper sticker go ahead and pull you over because you're
[14:29.060 --> 14:33.500]  probably a terrorist or if you also have an American flag or you're a
[14:33.500 --> 14:37.020]  returning veteran or gun owner and so she made the joke that she went and got
[14:37.020 --> 14:40.900]  rid of her Ron Paul personalized a license plate and gave it to us as a
[14:40.900 --> 14:45.740]  little memento so we appreciate Charlotte isn't be giving us that by the way she
[14:45.740 --> 15:05.260]  is going to be joining us Friday correct jaren she's on the show Friday okay well
[15:05.260 --> 15:09.460]  no I think he told me that she's on Friday I mean I think that's in the
[15:09.460 --> 15:19.460]  schedule so I was just asking yeah no I understand anyway she's gonna be on the
[15:19.460 --> 15:28.300]  show Friday I believe also we got some other special guests coming up next week
[15:28.300 --> 15:33.700]  but we're gonna get her to pop back on the broadcast tomorrow dovetailing in
[15:33.700 --> 15:44.140]  with Paul Joseph Watson's article eco fascist call for prison cities Watson
[15:44.140 --> 15:49.260]  wrote a great informative article that's more detailed planned oppolus a
[15:49.260 --> 15:53.820]  leadest agenda for eco enslavement I'm gonna cover that in deep detail coming
[15:53.820 --> 15:59.260]  up in about 15 minutes when we start the bottom of the hour segment but I called
[15:59.260 --> 16:03.900]  Watson this morning and I said look I want to integrate this in with the fact
[16:03.900 --> 16:11.940]  that this is literally the facelift the 2.0 version of the scientific eugenics
[16:11.940 --> 16:16.900]  dictatorship and that in their own UN admissions and the State Department
[16:16.900 --> 16:20.800]  random 200 and others they admit they are building a prison planet that's why
[16:20.800 --> 16:24.900]  we have prisonplanet.com that's why I call it a prison planet in
[16:24.900 --> 16:29.980]  road to tyranny that I released in 2002 that's why the 2007 film in-game
[16:29.980 --> 16:34.100]  blueprint for global enslavement released almost four years ago begins with the
[16:34.100 --> 16:38.540]  prison planet you will be locked down you will be allowed to have one child if
[16:38.540 --> 16:42.620]  you can pay all the taxes you will be completely enslaved you will not be
[16:42.620 --> 16:47.020]  able to travel outside your neighborhood there will be no travel allowed but
[16:47.020 --> 16:51.300]  essential travel and this is the stated plan rationing for everything total
[16:51.300 --> 16:57.460]  control so I suggest that everyone tune in coming up in about 15 minutes and call
[16:57.460 --> 17:00.780]  everybody you know and tell them to tune in because this is the big enchilada
[17:00.780 --> 17:06.060]  this is where we're going and this is not my opinion I want to make that clear
[17:06.060 --> 17:10.060]  just like it's not my opinion they've had massive secret weather modification
[17:10.060 --> 17:13.780]  going on for more than 50 years now it's all being declassified in your face
[17:13.780 --> 17:19.460]  most of it weather weapons it's not a secret that they're doing secret chemical
[17:19.460 --> 17:27.420]  biological radiological testing on the population all of that is coming out in
[17:27.420 --> 17:32.300]  the open and what they're doing is flaunting all of this until we just get
[17:32.300 --> 17:36.820]  acclimated see the general public if they don't see people go to prison for
[17:36.820 --> 17:40.780]  spying on them without warrants and they don't see people go into prison for
[17:40.780 --> 17:47.660]  shooting up foster kids with pesticides and unapproved drugs and biologicals
[17:47.660 --> 17:51.540]  and chemicals and radiologicals if they don't see people going to jail for

[24:24.540 --> 24:29.460]  TV interviews and I know I'm a hundred percent right about the globalist own
[24:29.460 --> 24:34.540]  statements and I have people like nightline and others come here and
[24:34.540 --> 24:39.340]  laugh at me when I tell them there's a world government being set up and they
[24:39.340 --> 24:44.900]  do TV specials saying I'm insane and doesn't matter how many documents I
[24:44.900 --> 24:48.340]  have what proof I have I sit there and talk to adult men and women who have
[24:48.340 --> 24:52.460]  children and I say listen I want to give you the Rockefeller documents with
[24:52.460 --> 24:56.100]  their add and sterilize to the vaccines they don't want them hey I want to give
[24:56.100 --> 25:00.180]  you the State Department random they don't want it let me give you the
[25:00.180 --> 25:05.180]  biological diversity assessment calling for 80% extermination they don't want
[25:05.180 --> 25:12.980]  it because they've subconsciously made a decision and then consciously made the
[25:12.980 --> 25:20.300]  decision that they just want to think it's all about ball games and having fun
[25:20.300 --> 25:29.180]  and planning their vacation it's all me me me me me me they're so selfish that
[25:29.180 --> 25:33.660]  their own future is being destroyed right in front of them and their children's
[25:33.660 --> 25:40.700]  future but they're so in the minute that they can't think long term and the
[25:40.700 --> 25:46.580]  globalist are masters at making sure everything goes at a slow phased in
[25:46.580 --> 25:52.100]  pace and every new phase of the enslavement is advertised and promoted
[25:52.100 --> 25:58.380]  and given cover stories the general public is given cover stories and then
[25:58.380 --> 26:03.220]  after the control grid and each phase is in then they go from denying it to
[26:03.220 --> 26:06.620]  saying oh yeah of course we control the weather well of course we're putting
[26:06.620 --> 26:13.100]  the stuff in your water what do you think we do it for silly well of course
[26:13.100 --> 26:18.860]  and I'll be on countless radio shows and read quotes about how they want to
[26:18.860 --> 26:23.220]  reduce world population and the talk show host liberal conservative
[26:23.220 --> 26:32.020]  entertainment comedy whatever the case is conservative mainline talk radio you
[26:32.020 --> 26:38.060]  know comedy like opi and Anthony doesn't matter I give them chapter verse I
[26:38.060 --> 26:43.500]  give him documents and they say well maybe there are too many people that
[26:43.500 --> 26:49.300]  makes sense see in the earlier version of propaganda they were supposed to deny
[26:49.300 --> 26:53.780]  this was going on because people hadn't been prepared psychologically yet now
[26:53.780 --> 26:58.260]  that we've reached the phase where they're going into a more hardcore level
[26:58.260 --> 27:02.820]  it's like yeah okay everybody knows they're killing us but it's good they
[27:02.820 --> 27:08.300]  think it's like received knowledge and special and intellectual that that
[27:08.300 --> 27:13.780]  that that they're into it and subconsciously they kind of see it as
[27:13.780 --> 27:21.140]  they're the elitist by by accepting it and by going along with it they believe
[27:21.140 --> 27:28.340]  they have power over it it's called delusion
[27:28.340 --> 27:35.140]  and different people are still in different phases of the propaganda the
[27:35.140 --> 27:39.340]  media simultaneously says there's no move to world government and it's not
[27:39.340 --> 27:43.340]  going to be run by big international banks that's insane while saying oh my
[27:43.340 --> 27:46.900]  gosh we just got a new plan to save the global economy it's a global government
[27:46.900 --> 27:50.900]  run by big private central banks so we're gonna have a world government we're
[27:50.900 --> 27:54.980]  setting it up right now with the band core global cashless currency and we're
[27:54.980 --> 28:00.140]  phasing out cash and all of that and we're gonna have forced inoculations
[28:00.140 --> 28:04.980]  and we are having your neighbors spy on you and we are putting in telescreens
[28:04.980 --> 28:09.140]  to watch everyone but there's no world government there's no band core global
[28:09.140 --> 28:16.580]  currency no one's spying on anybody and it's all insane if you criticize it and
[28:16.580 --> 28:20.780]  so people who've been culturally trained by the television and the double speak
[28:20.780 --> 28:24.540]  and the brainwashing it's seen as an attribute to be able to buy into the
[28:24.540 --> 28:31.660]  open ridiculous cartoonish level absurdist fraud and so your neighbor will
[28:31.660 --> 28:34.740]  both laugh at you with a self-assured look when you talk about world
[28:34.740 --> 28:40.620]  government but then also say well we all know that's what we need you think it's
[28:40.620 --> 28:43.380]  a world government but of course there is one but it's good but you're still
[28:43.380 --> 28:48.820]  crazy and that's seen as a knowledge to be gullible to be stupid to be foolish
[28:48.820 --> 28:55.540]  to trick yourself to be into being abused and robbed and and as long as
[28:55.540 --> 28:59.420]  people have their baubles their iPhones their iPads their computers their their
[28:59.420 --> 29:05.820]  cars their you know their latest cool clothes they're happy to sell out their
[29:05.820 --> 29:12.100]  liberty their freedom their dignity a lot of people fetishize submitting to
[29:12.100 --> 29:17.860]  abuse and tyranny I mean when a cop comes up to me and I'm on a street corner
[29:17.860 --> 29:21.020]  demonstrating and says I'm gonna arrest you if you don't leave I see it as a
[29:21.020 --> 29:24.820]  full assault on the Bill of Rights and Constitution I know if that goes
[29:24.820 --> 29:29.220]  everything follows and then we'll be in bondage I know what it means to private
[29:29.220 --> 29:33.780]  property and family I know the danger I want to wake the cop up I don't want
[29:33.780 --> 29:37.060]  them to be an instrument of my destruction and their destruction so I
[29:37.060 --> 29:41.540]  become outraged and the yuppie you'll say on YouTube oh just follow authority
[29:41.540 --> 29:48.740]  do what you're told don't be so uppity go along bend over well they're right

[33:00.420 --> 33:11.340]  defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's Alex Jones
[33:15.700 --> 33:25.020]  it is one thing to read United Nations biological diversity assessments and
[33:25.020 --> 33:30.660]  club of Rome reports and Rockefeller Foundation reports where they openly
[33:30.660 --> 33:36.180]  come out and say that they were going to train us to not have families that they
[33:36.180 --> 33:41.020]  were going to break up our industrial society and our agrarian society so that
[33:41.020 --> 33:45.540]  we're dependent on the state that the government and mega corporations that
[33:45.540 --> 33:52.620]  grow up around it would control every facet of our lives and to see the
[33:52.620 --> 33:56.540]  United Nations 50 plus years ago reporting on this the Rockefeller
[33:56.540 --> 34:02.540]  Foundation almost a hundred years ago pushing this Edward Bernays promoting
[34:02.540 --> 34:13.260]  it countless globalist Aldous Huxley his brother at the UN Julian Huxley HG Wells
[34:13.260 --> 34:18.660]  all of them writing nonfiction books battle planning this absolute
[34:18.660 --> 34:23.500]  nightmare where this tiny scientific elite would rule over the population and
[34:23.500 --> 34:29.700]  this giant control grid these compact prison cities are a means to an end and
[34:29.700 --> 34:38.020]  they are prisons and that's why I have the website prison planet dot com they
[34:38.020 --> 34:42.340]  are turning our local communities into prisons our schools into prisons the
[34:42.340 --> 34:46.660]  hospitals into prisons and now more and more I see citizens in Australia in the
[34:46.660 --> 34:51.020]  headlines hospitals are now prisons I see articles in the US schools are now
[34:51.020 --> 34:55.780]  prisons they are and and by increment we're being brought into these prisons
[34:55.780 --> 35:01.460]  and we're also being told that this new collectivism is for the earth it has
[35:01.460 --> 35:07.180]  nothing to do with the environment the global engineers when you read their
[35:07.180 --> 35:11.580]  deeper writings say they're gonna remake the earth they can care less about the
[35:11.580 --> 35:15.140]  earth anything they destroy they believe through genetic engineering and
[35:15.140 --> 35:19.380]  their seed vaults they're going to be able to rebuild they believe in
[35:19.380 --> 35:24.860]  destroying something to recreate it they think they're God so understand that
[35:24.860 --> 35:28.900]  now something else is going on here I'm gonna go through all of this here they
[35:28.900 --> 35:33.140]  take 30 minutes by taking our I'm gonna break this down right now the prison
[35:33.140 --> 35:37.580]  city the prison planet the end of humanity as we know it irrevocably
[35:37.580 --> 35:44.100]  damaging and breaking the human family re-engineering it just like they
[35:44.100 --> 35:49.380]  re-engineer a salmon or they re-engineer a goat to produce spider webs for
[35:49.380 --> 35:54.300]  body armor we are being engineered our water is being manipulated we're being
[35:54.300 --> 35:59.660]  electromagnetically manipulated it's all admitted and the biggest message here
[35:59.660 --> 36:05.500]  is the average bureaucrat or cop or enforcer or TSA person you are under
[36:05.500 --> 36:13.180]  just as much attack as all of us you are on our side of the fence there's only a
[36:13.180 --> 36:17.060]  few thousand top globalist even Roth cop the head of the Kissinger group admits
[36:17.060 --> 36:20.500]  that in a book he wrote he also wrote an article about it for the Washington post
[36:20.500 --> 36:27.780]  three years ago called superclass where he openly admitted that there are 6,000
[36:27.780 --> 36:32.540]  global superclass rulers and of course he's a mid-level servant so he would see
[36:32.540 --> 36:37.460]  it from that perspective as one of the 6,000 super gophers there's less than
[36:37.460 --> 36:44.620]  20 super families only a couple hundred master owners and a very few at the top
[36:44.620 --> 36:51.940]  who have total power and that's what these global councils have created and
[36:51.940 --> 36:56.620]  it's because the globalists know how to combine forces and work together that
[36:56.620 --> 37:01.580]  they're so dangerous they have a goal it is immortality this is their own
[37:01.580 --> 37:05.500]  statements it's covered my seminal film in game their own statements over and
[37:05.500 --> 37:12.620]  over again planetary government control grid under environmental rationing then
[37:12.620 --> 37:18.900]  controlled bio weapon plagues release that they have the cure for the immunity
[37:18.900 --> 37:23.180]  for underground bases that they will re-emerge from after we've been
[37:23.180 --> 37:29.260]  eliminated now this is going to happen I told you gold was going to go from 300
[37:29.260 --> 37:34.020]  to 1410 years ago it has I told you they were going to blow up the world trade
[37:34.020 --> 37:38.620]  center and blame it on their asset bin Laden it happened I've told you they're
[37:38.620 --> 37:41.780]  gonna announce a world government world bank I told you that they would still
[37:41.780 --> 37:46.140]  trillions in the bailout and then not tell Congress where the money went all I
[37:46.140 --> 37:52.580]  do is eat drink and sleep and dream and pray this information that's all I do
[37:52.580 --> 37:57.780]  when I'm holding my littlest daughter in my arms my smallest daughter I'm trying
[37:57.780 --> 38:03.740]  to think about her and lover and I do but I am somewhere else okay this is
[38:03.740 --> 38:09.100]  all this is 100 percent happening you understand you are being murdered you
[38:09.100 --> 38:14.180]  are being killed you are being brain damaged your potential is being bent
[38:14.180 --> 38:19.900]  and stunted now let me start getting in this information here is Paul Watson's
[38:19.900 --> 38:23.820]  latest article two articles today by the one the only Paul Watson
[38:23.820 --> 38:28.420]  Plandopolis a leadess agenda for eco enslavement I called them we had a 30
[38:28.420 --> 38:31.820]  minute consultation this morning and I said your article isn't hardcore enough
[38:31.820 --> 38:37.300]  it doesn't give them the full magnitude I want this article eco fascist call for
[38:37.300 --> 38:47.940]  present cities he did it these people are absolute control freak murdering
[38:47.940 --> 38:53.780]  filth and I wrote these notes I wanted to cover first there's an attempt to
[38:53.780 --> 38:58.380]  rebrand dystopia they're lovingly taking their time destroying the human
[38:58.380 --> 39:04.180]  species irrevocably wrecking humanity the prison school city state nation
[39:04.180 --> 39:10.260]  planet the end of the family now what got me so upset this morning is their
[39:10.260 --> 39:15.380]  brazen nakedness there is an organization in England funded by the
[39:15.380 --> 39:19.820]  government that partners with the Guardian just as the Guardian and others
[39:19.820 --> 39:24.620]  partnered with the 1010 group that produced the movie theater ads and TV ads
[39:24.620 --> 39:31.100]  where the teacher says okay we're playing in later okay will you cut your
[39:31.100 --> 39:36.680]  carbon footprint most the kids say yes a few say no and they blow up a bunch of
[39:36.680 --> 39:40.100]  10 year olds little girls little boys guts and blood fly everywhere then it
[39:40.100 --> 39:45.500]  shows the same thing at a business office at a football club the whole thing
[39:45.500 --> 39:50.620]  they know that once you don't have bedrock morals that are your own that's
[39:50.620 --> 39:54.580]  why they attack anything old may not be perfect the way the Christian faith
[39:54.580 --> 39:59.140]  manifest or the Muslim faith or the Judaic faith or the Buddhist faith
[39:59.140 --> 40:03.580]  doesn't matter they attack it because it's old and it's guaranteed to have a
[40:03.580 --> 40:07.220]  lot more common sense than what they're doing like the family's good
[40:07.220 --> 40:11.300]  independence is good spying and tattling on neighbors is bad
[40:11.300 --> 40:15.020]  governments that wear black uniforms are bad just archetypal understandings
[40:15.020 --> 40:20.740]  they are taking an archetypal wickedness and saying Luke Skywalker bad Darth
[40:20.740 --> 40:26.020]  Vader good they're throwing extreme things out torturing children in front
[40:26.020 --> 40:30.900]  of their parents good that's what the new hero does murdering children good and
[40:30.900 --> 40:35.780]  they're interplaying it where they can say this foreign group is bad when they
[40:35.780 --> 40:41.580]  do it but our government's good when they do it and all the nature shows and
[40:41.580 --> 40:46.580]  the programs and the brainwashing in public and private schools all of them
[40:46.580 --> 40:51.020]  teach humans are bad humans are evil and then they get you to do something
[40:51.020 --> 40:58.620]  reasonable at first a low flush toilet no lead paint catalytic converters then
[40:58.620 --> 41:04.140]  it's don't take a hot bath then it's don't have more than one child then it's
[41:04.140 --> 41:07.940]  spy on your parents for environmental crimes that aren't even crimes yet but
[41:07.940 --> 41:11.540]  have them write fake tickets on mommy and daddy and write dossiers on mommy and
[41:11.540 --> 41:15.460]  daddy and then have news articles everywhere where parents are in the news
[41:15.460 --> 41:20.020]  approving of their children instructing them and tattling on them with
[41:20.020 --> 41:29.380]  government orders just absolute 110% crème dollar crème ultimate tyranny the
[41:29.380 --> 41:33.300]  greatest expression of tyranny children openly turned against their parents by
[41:33.300 --> 41:42.700]  the state and so they're just practicing all of this right out in front of all
[41:42.700 --> 41:46.300]  of us and I've mentioned this years ago I've mentioned it previously and it's
[41:46.300 --> 41:50.700]  so important it's the overton window and there's other psychological schools of
[41:50.700 --> 41:55.020]  thought that say the same thing the communists talked about this linen talked
[41:55.020 --> 41:59.460]  about freezing and unfreezing society create enough crisis enough fear
[41:59.460 --> 42:04.780]  unfreeze the status quo when it's liquefied they can remold it like wet
[42:04.780 --> 42:08.940]  clay in the image they want and then freeze it again we are in an unfrozen
[42:08.940 --> 42:15.340]  mode right now as they bring in the tyranny but in that open window we can
[42:15.340 --> 42:22.580]  strike back and we are now another way to see it is the overton window the
[42:22.580 --> 42:26.420]  overton window is a political theory described as a window in a range of
[42:26.420 --> 42:32.620]  public reactions to ideas and public discourse in a spectrum of all possible
[42:32.620 --> 42:37.020]  opinions on a particular issue it is named after its originator Joseph P
[42:37.020 --> 42:42.980]  overton former vice president of the mechanic center for public policy and
[42:42.980 --> 42:47.220]  it goes on at any given moment the window includes a range of policies
[42:47.220 --> 42:50.580]  considered to be politically acceptable in the current climate of public
[42:50.580 --> 42:55.740]  opinion which a politician can recommend without being considered too extreme or
[42:55.740 --> 43:00.900]  outside of the mainstream to gain or keep public office overton arranged the
[43:00.900 --> 43:07.420]  spectrum on a vertical axis of more free or less free in regards to government
[43:07.420 --> 43:12.140]  intervention when the window moves or expands ideas or accordingly become more
[43:12.140 --> 43:16.860]  or less politically acceptable the degrees of acceptance of public ideas
[43:16.860 --> 43:21.540]  can be described roughly unthinkable radical acceptable sensible popular
[43:21.540 --> 43:28.900]  policy well now they've taught children in school not to have opinions not to
[43:28.900 --> 43:39.140]  judge cultures like Aztecs bad Nazis bad Communist bad Renaissance good so
[43:39.140 --> 43:42.340]  people can't judge then they come in though and say but you've got to follow
[43:42.340 --> 43:47.780]  our moral dictates save the earth your bad kill yourself death education the
[43:47.780 --> 43:52.780]  the world without humans the planet after humans all these TV shows all these
[43:52.780 --> 43:58.780]  movies apocalyptic doom coming everyone dead getting you ready so that you
[43:58.780 --> 44:03.460]  accept it as everyone's dying around you from the bio weapon they will release I
[44:03.460 --> 44:09.860]  believe bio weapons the way they're gonna go they'll be beta test ahead of it at
[44:09.860 --> 44:12.660]  least a lot of you servants of evil when you're being killed by this if we
[44:12.660 --> 44:15.700]  don't turn this around at least when it's happening finally you'll wake up and
[44:15.700 --> 44:19.540]  get right with God and that's what matters at the end of it and some people
[44:19.540 --> 44:22.940]  survive and dig in and then you'll fully know when the government's flying
[44:22.940 --> 44:26.540]  around its drones saying come out come out we want to help you the plague is
[44:26.540 --> 44:29.980]  over you'll know that's the enemy a lot of you'll still come out though even when
[44:29.980 --> 44:32.900]  that happens but doesn't matter you'll be watching this transmission later and
[44:32.900 --> 44:35.780]  I'm speaking to you in the future and that's what matters we can beat these
[44:35.780 --> 44:40.340]  people even if they were able to carry it this far now you know now you know
[44:40.340 --> 44:51.260]  how real it is all right continuing so what they're doing is they're just out
[44:51.260 --> 44:55.220]  in the open saying we'll murder your children they have green police ads for
[44:55.220 --> 45:00.220]  outing and then the the the ad agency in San Francisco months after I told you
[45:00.220 --> 45:03.580]  this came out and said this is what we really want we're using this as a
[45:03.580 --> 45:07.060]  social message that you will be arrested for the wrong lightbulbs San
[45:07.060 --> 45:12.180]  Francisco Chronicle as I played that ad of green police and I said this is
[45:12.180 --> 45:22.060]  what they're going to do this is their real plan this is their program now
[45:22.060 --> 45:27.700]  they're putting out all these TV ads and videos promoting horrible horrible
[45:27.700 --> 45:31.580]  dystopic futures where if you don't accept a police state control grid
[45:31.580 --> 45:35.940]  you're going to be put in a ghetto you don't accept a microchip under your skin
[45:35.940 --> 45:38.900]  that's what all the transhumanists say that's what the government says oh you
[45:38.900 --> 45:43.780]  don't have to have the brain chip you just won't be able to get a job anywhere
[45:44.780 --> 45:49.340]  and they lay out how wonderful it is that you only get meat on your birthday
[45:49.340 --> 45:52.940]  that you got to have a travel pass that everywhere you go is tracked and they
[45:52.940 --> 45:56.980]  say it with a straight face how great it is knowing they're moving the overton
[45:56.980 --> 46:05.780]  window into the bizarro so that they pull you so far away that just having a
[46:05.780 --> 46:08.700]  smart meter controlling the temperature your house sounds reasonable
[46:08.700 --> 46:11.700]  compared to what they're proposing murdering school children that they
[46:11.700 --> 46:16.100]  don't submit now it doesn't sound so extreme to say hey we just want a smart
[46:16.100 --> 46:20.060]  meter in your house that sounded extreme ten years ago when I told you
[46:20.060 --> 46:23.380]  about it and people laughed even when I had the government reports on it now
[46:23.380 --> 46:30.380]  they're going in everywhere and it's just accepted I mean this is diabolical
[46:30.380 --> 46:34.580]  psychological warfare now what they don't tell you is once you're in the
[46:34.580 --> 46:39.060]  compact cities those will be the final kill grids and they're going to have the
[46:39.060 --> 46:42.140]  compact cities not just in the name of the environment but when they wipe out
[46:42.140 --> 46:49.040]  with genetically designed race specific weapons when you know when people see
[46:49.040 --> 46:53.500]  tens of millions dying those will just be the beta test people will run into
[46:53.500 --> 46:57.580]  the compact cities kind of a 12 monkey scenario where we're all going into this
[46:57.580 --> 47:02.100]  see they're going to hit us from that security bio weapons security environmental
[47:02.100 --> 47:06.020]  when you read the SPP you learn a lot and you see it mirrored and all their
[47:06.020 --> 47:09.860]  other programs how they say every crisis the answer will be North American
[47:09.860 --> 47:16.100]  merger see every crisis the answer will be high-tech surveillance cities and it's
[47:16.100 --> 47:20.580]  all being announced the big rollouts the control grids the face-scanning cameras
[47:20.580 --> 47:25.500]  multi-billion dollar in Texas and San Antonio and outside Salt Lake in Utah
[47:25.500 --> 47:31.020]  giant spy center cybersecurity total control high school recruiting of all
[47:31.020 --> 47:34.700]  the young hackers armies of them to shut down free speech I mean they're
[47:34.700 --> 47:40.020]  moving in full mechanization against free humanity right now they're gonna
[47:40.020 --> 47:45.380]  increase the degenerative bio and chemical weapons and radiological and
[47:45.380 --> 47:49.340]  also the electromagnetic weapon systems they're pumping in against us that's
[47:49.340 --> 47:53.420]  all gonna now start increasing your neighbors dying to your left your right
[47:53.420 --> 47:57.380]  you dying it's just gonna get worse and worse and then saying everything's fine
[47:57.380 --> 48:02.100]  and the yuppies giggling and you know local jogging groups to raise money you
[48:02.100 --> 48:05.580]  know because everybody's dying we got to find the cure to it that'll be put into
[48:05.580 --> 48:09.020]  bio weapons funding to actually make more bio weapons for you and your
[48:09.020 --> 48:13.580]  family all the major groups fighting the diabetes the cancer the heart disease
[48:13.580 --> 48:18.340]  all actually funding and running operations on how to carry it out full
[48:18.340 --> 48:23.780]  spectrum dominance full death full massacre this is the giant plan we're
[48:23.780 --> 48:27.500]  gonna go to break here in a moment but I want to go ahead and play from in game
[48:27.500 --> 48:31.860]  just the first few minutes of the film after the three-minute intro the first
[48:31.860 --> 48:36.260]  few minutes where I lay out the prison planet control grid and then I'm gonna
[48:36.260 --> 48:40.260]  play produced with government money out of England what they're showing school
[48:40.260 --> 48:48.100]  kids about the future it's exactly what I say but saying it's good now how did I
[48:48.100 --> 48:52.340]  know this because it was their written plan but to see it manifesting here it
[48:52.340 --> 49:01.300]  is let's play part of in game your new world order will follow humanity will
[49:01.300 --> 49:30.380]  defeat you the answer to 1984 is 1776 in the near future earth is dominated by a
[49:30.380 --> 49:35.300]  powerful world government is from 2007 once free nations are slaves to the
[49:35.300 --> 49:42.900]  will of a tiny elite the dawn of a new dark age is upon mankind countries are
[49:42.900 --> 49:48.620]  a thing of the past every form of independence is under attack with the
[49:48.620 --> 49:55.340]  family and even the individual itself nearing extinction close to 80% of the
[49:55.340 --> 50:01.340]  earth's population has been eliminated the remnants of a once free humanity
[50:01.340 --> 50:06.940]  are forced to live within highly controlled compact prison-like cities
[50:06.940 --> 50:12.840]  travel is highly restricted super highways connect the mega cities and
[50:12.840 --> 50:18.620]  keep the population from entering into unauthorized zones no human activities
[50:18.620 --> 50:25.900]  private AI supercomputers chronicle and categorize every action a prison planet
[50:25.900 --> 50:30.540]  dominated by a ruthless gang of control freak alright whose power we're gonna go
[50:30.540 --> 50:35.780]  to break and then we're gonna come back and play a minute or so more now you

[54:14.140 --> 54:19.980]  their goal a program of total dehumanization where the science of
[54:19.980 --> 54:26.260]  tyranny is law a worldwide control grid designed to ensure the overlords
[54:26.260 --> 54:31.060]  monopoly of power forever our species will be condemned to this nightmare
[54:31.060 --> 54:35.460]  future unless the masses are awakened to the new world order master plan and
[54:35.460 --> 54:43.460]  mobilized to defeat it erected by a secretive group the Georgia guide stones
[54:43.460 --> 54:49.500]  are a testament to the elites plan for a world religion global laws with a
[54:49.500 --> 54:56.500]  global court and army to enforce it and set in stone it is written that the
[54:56.500 --> 55:08.140]  population never rise above 500 million in this film you will learn how our
[55:08.140 --> 55:12.860]  world is truly governed you will see how highly secretive roundtable groups
[55:12.860 --> 55:17.860]  interlock to form a global intelligence network this group has been steering
[55:17.860 --> 55:23.500]  planetary affairs for hundreds of years now in the final stage they prepare for
[55:23.500 --> 55:30.660]  open world government a goal tyrants throughout history have lusted after
[55:30.660 --> 55:35.100]  dr. Michael Kaufman is a published ecologist all right and then we get
[55:35.100 --> 55:39.020]  into the main part of the film now you heard me just play from the intro of
[55:39.020 --> 55:44.420]  the documentary then we get into more chapters going through every facet of
[55:44.420 --> 55:48.380]  it with all the proof their statements their video clips how they're gonna
[55:48.380 --> 55:52.580]  set up the grid how they're gonna cut off our resources always promising to
[55:52.580 --> 55:56.220]  fix things we give them more power always getting more of a stranglehold
[55:56.220 --> 56:02.220]  around us and then killing us and the average yuppie who finally accepts this
[56:02.220 --> 56:07.980]  automatically says well then I'll be part of the elite no you won't get that
[56:07.980 --> 56:11.820]  through your head it's very sick that you go along with this but I guess you
[56:11.820 --> 56:14.940]  were taught in college and it's cool to be into killing people and there's too
[56:14.940 --> 56:20.220]  many people you have a disdain for folks so you're getting what you deserve but I
[56:20.220 --> 56:24.420]  don't deserve it my family doesn't and free humanity and people that have got
[56:24.420 --> 56:28.620]  a soul out there don't deserve it and we stand against you now we're gonna go to
[56:28.620 --> 56:31.180]  break here in a few minutes but I'm gonna go ahead and start playing this clip
[56:31.180 --> 56:37.080]  and again this is airing over in England this is promoted with government
[56:37.080 --> 56:42.300]  funding the one and guardians involved the planned opolis elitist agenda for
[56:42.300 --> 56:48.100]  eco fascist enslavement and I'll start playing part of it now come back and
[56:48.100 --> 56:56.460]  play the rest of it but it's so amazing how they just calmly describe total
[56:56.460 --> 57:01.940]  surveillance total tyranny food rationing government authorization to even
[57:01.940 --> 57:09.180]  travel to work every day but it's not tyranny it's done to save the earth what
[57:09.180 --> 57:12.840]  came out all over the news the last week that the and it's confirmed the
[57:12.840 --> 57:17.420]  German government admits it's true they claimed that it was for the environment
[57:17.420 --> 57:21.220]  all these spy satellites they were launching these infrared spy satellites
[57:21.220 --> 57:26.660]  all the billions of dollars it wasn't to spy on you in England and the United
[57:26.660 --> 57:34.540]  States and Europe no in the US German BND partnership no it was to check for
[57:34.540 --> 57:41.540]  greenhouse gases turns out it's body scanning from orbit this is their cover
[57:41.540 --> 57:48.140]  it has nothing to do with the earth what Bill Gates say on Ted TV last year he
[57:48.140 --> 57:50.860]  said we've got to lower the human population to lower the carbon footprint
[57:50.860 --> 57:56.900]  humans exhale carbon dioxide it's part of the life cycle then plants they release
[57:56.900 --> 58:03.220]  oxygen they respirate and operate and engage in photosynthesis from carbon
[58:03.220 --> 58:08.060]  dioxide that animal life puts off then they release oxygen that animal life
[58:08.060 --> 58:14.940]  lives on symbiotic carbon cycle water oxygen carbon dioxide sunlight four
[58:14.940 --> 58:21.060]  things four things and they've got the public convinced and ready to salute
[58:21.060 --> 58:25.300]  going after carbon dioxide you want to genetically engineer cross PC spider
[58:25.300 --> 58:32.500]  goats salmon everything deadly just hurting the earth go for it you want
[58:32.500 --> 58:39.900]  to breathe no we're gonna come back play the clip stay with us
[58:39.900 --> 58:51.340]  on air online and on demand we are the GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with
[58:51.340 --> 58:55.140]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[58:55.140 --> 58:58.860]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[58:58.860 --> 59:03.380]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[59:03.380 --> 59:07.620]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[59:07.620 --> 59:12.220]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[59:12.220 --> 59:16.180]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[59:16.180 --> 59:20.340]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather
[59:20.340 --> 59:24.300]  is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[59:24.300 --> 59:28.020]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[59:28.020 --> 59:31.940]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in
[59:31.940 --> 59:35.140]  the solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my old
[59:35.140 --> 59:40.620]  sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's my
[59:40.620 --> 59:44.860]  solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the Sun so go to my
[59:44.860 --> 59:51.500]  solar backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[59:51.500 --> 01:00:05.940]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network big brother
[01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:13.300]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's
[01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:21.180]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:26.420]  we're back most of our affiliates carry the first five minutes segment some
[01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:30.900]  don't so I'm going to launch back into this newest video and get into these
[01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:34.980]  incredible articles by Paul Joseph Watson in the next segment that's about
[01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:39.300]  seven minutes away let me just tell you about some of the other information
[01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:45.900]  coming up in one hour from now Alan Watt will join us for an hour then
[01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:51.540]  appears carbon meteorologist who actually understands how the weather works
[01:00:51.540 --> 01:01:00.700]  dealing with solar and moon interactions dealing with the solar winds which
[01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:06.180]  the ancients knew now in the last 20 years has been proven that what's driving
[01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:11.700]  the cloud formations is not pot ash and volcanoes but is all of the massive
[01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:16.900]  ionizing radiation particles micrometeorites by the ton that are
[01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:23.940]  coming into the atmosphere every day yeah we're big spaceship folks hurtling
[01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:29.140]  through the edge of the Milky Way galaxy we're out here in the moon docks
[01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:35.100]  orbiting a little Sun and we're moving mighty fast orbiting that Sun and space
[01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:42.820]  is not avoid it is filled with energy it is filled with the quantum vacuum with
[01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:49.820]  the ether and just in our dimension there are just so many gamma rays and
[01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:54.860]  x-rays and particles and just it's a full spectrum and of course now the
[01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:59.380]  mathematical equations of Einstein and others have been proven to correct many
[01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:06.100]  physicists predicted there would be a hexagon in the ice cap of the gas giant
[01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:11.860]  Saturn and after the different was it Voyager and others went over they did
[01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:18.460]  photograph that hexagon which is a dimensional expression on the surface
[01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:22.620]  of the gas giant that mathematics showed would be there in a gas giant of that
[01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:33.300]  size an expression of a dimension beneath the surface or a space wormhole
[01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:36.980]  distortion of a type I don't claim to be a physicist I just read the major
[01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:42.540]  bodies of the work and then regurgitated as a lay creature here on air ladies and
[01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:47.900]  gentlemen but I study the mass psychology of tyrants the psychopathic
[01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:54.340]  elites that always take control the scum rising to the top after good rises
[01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:58.060]  the top milk and honey flows then we become fat that I'm unhappy and the
[01:02:58.060 --> 01:03:04.580]  evil takes over of course action alert now the FDA is going after vitamin C
[01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:08.660]  that's up on prison planet dot com Utah welcomes NSA mega snoop center

[01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:22.540]  fascist call for prison cities I know Matt drudge listens to the show and Matt
[01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:26.180]  drudge in the last five years has taken a clear course into liberty and fighting
[01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:29.540]  the globalist and covering the Bilderberg group and covering everything
[01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:33.620]  else and Matt drudge gave us a Christmas present the only red links out of green
[01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:38.180]  links on Christmas Day were Alex Jones and info wars dot com so I I don't look
[01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:43.460]  a gift horse in the mouth when somebody gives me so much and humanity so much in
[01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:49.660]  in in really turning towards liberty towards the pole star the north star I
[01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:55.660]  don't like to ask for more but if drudge is listening I'd really like it if you
[01:03:55.660 --> 01:04:00.740]  linked to eco fascist call for prison cities you know I burn with desire to
[01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:06.620]  expose these people and I know you do as well and it'd be nice if drudge linked
[01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:10.500]  to that and if it if you do I won't start asking every day I have asked
[01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:14.820]  before that drudge move a link to the top to see if he was listening and he did
[01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:18.140]  within minutes I don't know if drudge is listening today but Matt drudge we
[01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:21.900]  appreciate you Matt drudge is a smart guy he realizes none of us have any
[01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:30.260]  future if we don't beat these people and the truth is what matters and drudge
[01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:33.340]  isn't perfect none of us are but he is moving in the right direction in a big
[01:04:33.340 --> 01:04:37.340]  way and forcing Glenn Beck and many others and wash limbaugh to go in the
[01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:40.780]  right direction he truly is setting more and more the agenda I'd like to see
[01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:46.420]  eco fascist call for prison cities to be on the all-powerful drudge report all
[01:04:46.420 --> 01:04:50.220]  powerful that is an alternative media cyberspace projection of information

[01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:31.740]  growth properties in fact Barron's called his work a dire prophecy recently he
[01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:35.340]  created a video which you can watch online for free detailing his biggest and
[01:07:35.340 --> 01:07:39.340]  most important prediction yet and it's a real eye-opener I can't stress this

[01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:11.020]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network all right so we've seen the TV ads where
[01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:15.180]  children don't submit the carbon taxings and the teacher murders them by
[01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:22.580]  detonating explosives we have seen the promotion by Prince Philip and Ted Turner
[01:08:22.580 --> 01:08:27.660]  and others that we have a one-shot policy official UN policy China is the
[01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:34.700]  model forced abortion we're useless eaters feeders all of this Nazi eugenic
[01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:40.460]  nomenclature being openly used but the West the United States in England that
[01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:44.540]  part of the West the Anglo-American arm did not get these ideas from hair
[01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:51.740]  guruing hair Hitler hair gerbils they got it from the British not bashing the

[01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:08.420]  Mexico loved it I mean all these countries bought into it that's the
[01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:14.820]  death panels that's the euthanasia that's the brainwashing that's going on so
[01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:18.700]  at the end of the last hour I played the first few minutes from in-game where I
[01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:23.620]  said prison cities rationing the end of the family you'll have to have travel
[01:09:23.620 --> 01:09:28.460]  passes to go to work how did I know that that's the official club of Rome UN and
[01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:33.420]  the film in game over two hours long breaks it all down it's free on YouTube
[01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:39.260]  and Google higher quality at prison planet TV I'm not making expensive films
[01:09:39.260 --> 01:09:43.140]  here and traveling all over the world and getting arrested and detained to play
[01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:52.980]  a game here folks this is real now I get up this morning at about 6 a.m. I
[01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:57.980]  waterl into the computer wake up start drinking coffee and I see Watson's
[01:09:57.980 --> 01:10:04.660]  article and instantly I knew it was the government funded group connected to 1010
[01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:07.580]  hooked in with a London Guardian I go to their site there's the Guardian the
[01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:14.620]  sponsor there's the British government there it all is funding it and you
[01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:18.060]  think it's a joke someone who hasn't been brainwashed you watch it you think
[01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:21.420]  it's a joke just like the blowing up of the kids if they don't submit it's not a
[01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:27.700]  joke again they're conditioning us and rebranding tyranny rebranding mass
[01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:32.780]  murder as if it's a good thing that they're hoping that you're so devoid of
[01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:37.900]  your own morals or compass that now that we're rudderless they can bring in this
[01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:43.780]  extremism and this is what smart growth is this is this is about the
[01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:50.020]  consolidation of power only insider corporations get the contracts so when
[01:10:50.020 --> 01:10:53.860]  you watch this video that I'm gonna be stopping and commenting on remember this
[01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:57.860]  is not a joke they've got a whole bunch of them on this nightmare site that's
[01:10:57.860 --> 01:11:03.180]  linked in Paul Watson's articles planned opolis a lead us to gender for eco
[01:11:03.180 --> 01:11:08.420]  enslavement and you guys did make Jesse Ventura the number one search term
[01:11:08.420 --> 01:11:13.540]  yesterday Jesse Ventura censored I want to do this again today I waited a few
[01:11:13.540 --> 01:11:16.820]  weeks for you did this now we're gonna launch a full-scale Google bomb
[01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:24.140]  operation I want prison cities to be the number one search term today so that
[01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:30.420]  hundreds of other publications pick up on it you notice the mail the Huffington
[01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:35.220]  Post all these big publications picked up on our government testing angle on
[01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:42.460]  the bird deaths now proliferating worldwide we can punch through together
[01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:48.260]  if we work together we can punch through together and force people to see
[01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:52.300]  their own admissions of prison cities they just want to show these videos to
[01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:56.940]  your school kids in the US England and Europe see they're already in a more
[01:11:56.940 --> 01:12:00.580]  advanced stage of brainwashing because they know they're a captive audience and
[01:12:00.580 --> 01:12:04.460]  are more easily manipulated like Al Gore said two years ago hey if your parents
[01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:09.140]  don't listen to you you tell them what's right you tell them what I tell you to
[01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:12.580]  tell them the New York Times little girls going home writing fake tickets to
[01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:20.220]  their mommy for taking a hot bath they mean business and again real murderers
[01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:27.260]  real fascist real eugenicists learned and they eugenics quarterly changed its
[01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:32.180]  name all these groups admittedly became crypto eugenicists after Hitler embarrassed
[01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:39.180]  them up until the 1940s it was all out in the open and so now they pose as
[01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:44.220]  loving liberals these people in their own writings all of them slather with
[01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:48.060]  hatred and the Copenhagen thing coming out that it was all a fraud and the
[01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:52.180]  global warming was all fraud made him so mad literally hundreds of top professors
[01:12:52.180 --> 01:12:55.900]  we write articles every week about it it's all over mainstream news say yes we
[01:12:55.900 --> 01:13:02.100]  want fascism eco fascism is good Nazism is good but against all humans were a
[01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:10.140]  parasite again three and a half almost four years ago in game wasn't done yet
[01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:16.820]  I was working on a Saturday late at the office the ballet recital was nearby my
[01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:21.940]  office my wife and my parents show up with my children with my middle daughter
[01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:25.700]  in her ballerina outfit they're a little bit early they come in and I'm
[01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:29.140]  editing the film there's research documents everywhere Rob Jacobson
[01:13:29.140 --> 01:13:32.500]  Aaron Dykes we're all in there on a Saturday afternoon and my mother watches
[01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:37.100]  part of the intro the part you just saw last hour and she says that can't be true
[01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:41.300]  I know about eugenics and some of this but it just can't be true and my dad goes
[01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:45.540]  actually when I was at UT before he was at UT was top of his class in high
[01:13:45.540 --> 01:13:49.580]  school they had this advancement they brought in several hundred students he
[01:13:49.580 --> 01:13:53.620]  was in the top six they brought him aside told him world government's coming
[01:13:53.620 --> 01:14:00.300]  we want to advance you guys eugenics is good and my dad told my mother that as
[01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:03.900]  we drove the ballet recital and her mouth was hanging open they tell
[01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:10.740]  everybody this stuff every major university that's all it's taught okay
[01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:16.540]  and it teaches the so-called elitist everybody who's got a high IQ who gets
[01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:20.260]  advanced in these systems that you're the best you're gonna survive we're gonna
[01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:25.700]  get rid of the profane I mean my father couldn't even go to UT as a high
[01:14:25.700 --> 01:14:31.540]  schooler and not be brainwashed about this but he understood what it was
[01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:36.300]  because he was already so widely read this is this is everything okay this is
[01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:43.220]  what they're doing now let's go ahead and start playing this nightmare clip and
[01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:46.820]  we have links to the group the organization all of it this is a part
[01:14:46.820 --> 01:14:49.540]  of the same affiliated group that put out the video of the kids heads blowing
[01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:53.780]  off if they don't submit to carbon taxing here it is this is not a joke here
[01:14:53.780 --> 01:15:10.220]  it is for them for the future action for sustainable world
[01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:16.940]  mobility planned operas one of four episodes in a world of fossil fuels and
[01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:20.500]  expensive energy the only solution is tightly planned and controlled urban
[01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:27.620]  transport global climate change deal imminent this is news headlines joint
[01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:31.260]  venture to get city ready floating cities approved because of rising tides
[01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:37.580]  global food rations food to be planned welcome to the planned economy government
[01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:48.780]  takes over all food production oh hi I'm so glad you're on time I'm V I'm looking
[01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:52.580]  forward to showing you around planned operas today they show the subservient
[01:15:52.580 --> 01:15:56.660]  woman works from home he's a virtual engineer working on one of the city's
[01:15:56.660 --> 01:16:00.340]  desalination plants he controls the robots who do all the important
[01:16:00.340 --> 01:16:06.700]  maintenance I think he basically is computer games for a living you ready
[01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:12.860]  to go have you got your calorie card open on your smartphone it pause this was
[01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:17.620]  completely written by MI6 all of it has little psychological cues like don't
[01:16:17.620 --> 01:16:21.180]  worry you'll still have your video games you look at her husband he's jacked in
[01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:26.260]  like a cyborg because the oceans rose and destroyed everything and this is
[01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:32.180]  still taught complete lie they don't care let's continue travel corp the other
[01:16:32.180 --> 01:16:36.700]  day so they've a lot of do a journey time to to match mine it makes so much
[01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:42.300]  sense doesn't it switch off brain and go to work with this many people around
[01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:47.540]  glad there's a mega computer in charge it pause we're but back it up a few
[01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:51.420]  seconds good job guys you notice all these movements we're just now hearing
[01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:55.900]  about about a mega computer fairly giving out all the resources because the
[01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:59.180]  government's always real fair with their statistics and things that you know
[01:16:59.180 --> 01:17:02.460]  none of that would ever be gained notice all the movements we hear about that are
[01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:06.220]  the big solution that are supposedly grassroots that the mainstream media that
[01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:10.220]  embraces telling us how the mega computer will run everything that's
[01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:15.660]  stuff's a hundred years old that's what they plan then they have the grassroots
[01:17:15.660 --> 01:17:20.140]  put it out to make people think it's legitimate that it's coming from the
[01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:24.260]  grassroots as Cass Sunstein said they would do let's continue around I'm
[01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:30.460]  glad there's a mega computer in charge we're so lucky our kids were allocated
[01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:33.900]  to school quite near my practice so I can drop them off on the way it saves on
[01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:37.500]  our calorie ration well it won't be long until little darlings get their career
[01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:44.660]  announcements the little darlings get their career announcements there this is
[01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:48.100]  what Bill Gates is funding all over the world the government and corporate
[01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:52.180]  sponsors will tell you what you're going to be that's freedom isn't it the
[01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:56.780]  old cast society and there's a calorie ration and they've been allotted to be
[01:17:56.780 --> 01:18:00.900]  able allowed to travel to work they got to get an allotment every day all this
[01:18:00.900 --> 01:18:05.780]  is all going to happen this is all going in I have the New York Times from two
[01:18:05.780 --> 01:18:10.180]  days ago saying cameras will be everywhere watching us at all times but
[01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:15.020]  don't worry it's AI so it's not violating your rights continue I'm sure
[01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:18.260]  they'll get something good
[01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:23.740]  carbon scrubbers for living or anything are you hungry let's pop to the market as
[01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:30.500]  we're passing right what's on the menu this month no not meat it's not your
[01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:36.140]  birthday the global food council are doing a really good job of keeping food
[01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:40.500]  production going I mean you don't get the choice you used to but we're better
[01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:47.580]  off than most it's probably easiest to walk from here you barely see a car in
[01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:50.940]  the city centre nowadays unless you're rich
[01:18:50.940 --> 01:18:54.660]  well the state knows they just aren't practical anymore we're all trying to
[01:18:54.660 --> 01:18:59.180]  meet our global carbon deal electric bikes are so much better for getting
[01:18:59.180 --> 01:19:03.380]  around our neighborhood and why waste valuable space on car parks when you can
[01:19:03.380 --> 01:19:09.100]  use them to grow food I don't care what you say Alex they don't deserve to live
[01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:14.060]  in that ghetto they are completely disconnected no high-speed transport
[01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:20.380]  system no new internet they miss out on jobs and many essential services too oh
[01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:27.140]  hi again what a day I had to make an emergency visit to the cry freedom

[01:20:13.780 --> 01:20:18.500]  even collection lawsuits when I first joined I was being sued so I used the

[01:21:09.340 --> 01:21:13.220]  and bonds it makes me wonder if the US citizen will ever again have the right

[01:33:22.220 --> 01:33:26.580]  little you know happy it's always presented by a woman who Hitler said
[01:33:26.580 --> 01:33:30.260]  first you get the women then you've got the children so follow the men Edward
[01:33:30.260 --> 01:33:34.580]  Bernays the father of modern advertising nephew of Sigmund Freud said you get the
[01:33:34.580 --> 01:33:39.380]  women they make 80 percent of the purchases still the same today you get
[01:33:39.380 --> 01:33:45.260]  the women then you've got the children so follow the men women are at the center
[01:33:45.260 --> 01:33:49.540]  of the family and the center of culture it's not the women are bad it's that
[01:33:49.540 --> 01:33:54.260]  women are key and they know that women on average are more conformist and if
[01:33:54.260 --> 01:33:58.620]  things are presented in a happy-go-lucky way they will do it Aztec women would
[01:33:58.620 --> 01:34:02.700]  bring their child up bind it give it to the priest and be happy that they're
[01:34:02.700 --> 01:34:09.140]  newborn baby or their toddler bound with a rock was thrown into a deep chasm
[01:34:09.140 --> 01:34:14.860]  of water that's how they like to kill kids mainly and it's it it's the same
[01:34:14.860 --> 01:34:20.700]  thing it was this is how they do it and so you notice the ads for high fructose
[01:34:20.700 --> 01:34:24.620]  corn syrup that they run it's the woman with her boyfriend and idyllic
[01:34:24.620 --> 01:34:29.420]  pastoral scenes over and over again different variants or in a park or at a
[01:34:29.420 --> 01:34:33.260]  backyard party and the woman's handing out the food always in a position of
[01:34:33.260 --> 01:34:39.020]  authority and and you know she's the boss and she tells her husband or a
[01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:44.380]  boyfriend go ahead and have the popsicle go ahead and eat of the fruit no
[01:34:44.380 --> 01:34:47.980]  corn syrup's not bad for you it's quite good for you and then she'll give him
[01:34:47.980 --> 01:34:51.340]  some scientific stuff and the husband admits to the boyfriend admits he's an
[01:34:51.340 --> 01:34:56.500]  idiot or there'll be another moron woman who the queen be corrects and explains
[01:34:56.500 --> 01:35:01.540]  to and so this is how they always target it this is how they work it just like
[01:35:01.540 --> 01:35:06.020]  and if you went back to a plantation a hundred and seventy years ago in
[01:35:06.020 --> 01:35:10.820]  Alabama and you and you wrote up in your carriage you'd be met by several big
[01:35:10.820 --> 01:35:14.980]  black women and they could speak clear English they could probably even read and
[01:35:14.980 --> 01:35:19.060]  this was their operation and sometimes they even bossed master around if you
[01:35:19.060 --> 01:35:22.180]  read the cultural histories and the men were kept out in the barn and hardly
[01:35:22.180 --> 01:35:27.060]  could talk and those women would go back there and just beat them down how you
[01:35:27.060 --> 01:35:32.500]  learn you boy now that's how it works in Rome Caesar did the same thing he'd
[01:35:32.500 --> 01:35:38.140]  roll into Albion or Germany or gall first thing they do slaughter all the men
[01:35:38.140 --> 01:35:42.100]  and then they just there and beat those little boys in front of their women they
[01:35:42.100 --> 01:35:45.940]  take a teenager slit their throat and they'd say to the women you keep them
[01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:49.780]  in line or we're going to kill all of them and those women would just
[01:35:49.780 --> 01:35:54.100]  absolutely suppress their men forever back in Rome or wherever they were
[01:35:54.100 --> 01:36:00.940]  taken to plantations Austria you name it it's all and I've got all the handbooks
[01:36:00.940 --> 01:36:05.060]  on it these are all publicly shown them to you on air I've got slave manuals
[01:36:05.060 --> 01:36:12.580]  from the sugarcane operations in the Caribbean was the former name of what's
[01:36:12.580 --> 01:36:22.020]  Haiti and Dominican Republic Hispaniola I got a manual from Hispaniola 1701
[01:36:22.020 --> 01:36:27.740]  how to dig that back out I mean this is how they run it and they run it well
[01:36:27.740 --> 01:36:36.300]  they know exactly what they're doing you seen all the old black and white movies
[01:36:36.300 --> 01:36:41.060]  from the 30s and 40s where they phased it out political correctness which shows
[01:36:41.060 --> 01:36:46.500]  the black mammy running everything my dad grew up in east Texas cotton farming
[01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:55.700]  and with black foreman women who were bossing around the poor white farm hands
[01:36:55.700 --> 01:37:03.180]  this is how it works and that's basically what Oprah Winfrey is and that's how
[01:37:03.180 --> 01:37:07.740]  the globalist operate okay and you need to get that through your head you need
[01:37:07.740 --> 01:37:14.140]  to understand they know scientifically what they're doing okay I remember
[01:37:14.140 --> 01:37:17.260]  reading in some of the Caribbean manuals which were then exported and
[01:37:17.260 --> 01:37:21.260]  translated into English for use by the slave owners here in what is the United
[01:37:21.260 --> 01:37:27.460]  States today in Virginia and other areas and described how even when they took
[01:37:27.460 --> 01:37:32.980]  slaves off the boat they would and they even cited the Roman manuals how they
[01:37:32.980 --> 01:37:37.820]  would take the biggest strongest you know clear leader of the blacks that survive
[01:37:37.820 --> 01:37:41.620]  you can always tell by everybody looking to them you know to you know kind of get
[01:37:41.620 --> 01:37:45.900]  their orders who was seen as the dominant black male getting whoever
[01:37:45.900 --> 01:37:52.340]  survived the coffin ship off whether it was Boston or New York or Galveston
[01:37:52.340 --> 01:37:56.340]  Texas or New Orleans Louisiana and they're getting them off the ship they
[01:37:56.340 --> 01:38:01.540]  bring them up there to the block but before they even do that they would be
[01:38:01.540 --> 01:38:06.540]  to death or kill one of the strongest most intelligent obvious leaders in
[01:38:06.540 --> 01:38:09.660]  front of the women and then they would have their translator explain it all to
[01:38:09.660 --> 01:38:13.340]  them I mean they got it all figured out okay
[01:38:13.340 --> 01:38:18.100]  feminism CIA funded the whole deal and they've done a good job look our
[01:38:18.100 --> 01:38:22.260]  society is completely destroyed all right getting back to the eco fascist
[01:38:22.260 --> 01:38:25.500]  Adolf Hitler first you get the women and you got the children so follow the
[01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:33.340]  men Adolf Alois Hitler continuing eco fascist call for prison cities people
[01:38:33.340 --> 01:38:36.740]  who resist the state control of every aspect of their lives will be forced to
[01:38:36.740 --> 01:38:41.820]  live in ghettos and you just saw that from the piece and they admit that
[01:38:41.820 --> 01:38:45.780]  they'll be called a farming run by the state
[01:38:46.580 --> 01:38:51.700]  continuing Stalin organized land labor into large-scale collective farms
[01:38:51.700 --> 01:38:56.420]  farmers who resisted state taking over their farms that'll be big agribusiness
[01:38:56.420 --> 01:39:00.100]  doing it were arrested to send to Siberian gulags as a result the mass
[01:39:00.100 --> 01:39:04.700]  seizure of property and the disruption that collected farming brought to food
[01:39:04.700 --> 01:39:09.700]  production upwards of three million people died from starvation from 1932 to
[01:39:09.700 --> 01:39:14.100]  33 alone well yeah that was just Ukraine that's over 20 mil in the starvation
[01:39:14.100 --> 01:39:19.620]  overall a similar system imposed in Maoist China under the Great Leap forward
[01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:23.540]  led to the great Chinese famine and the starvation of at least 36 million
[01:39:23.540 --> 01:39:26.780]  people and that was planned as well we've had top historians on that subject
[01:39:26.780 --> 01:39:33.060]  the incarceration of resistors and green fascism inside squalid ghettos and
[01:39:33.060 --> 01:39:37.820]  their subsequent separation from family members is a frightening throwback to
[01:39:37.820 --> 01:39:42.340]  Nazi run Warsaw ghetto and other concentration camps and prisons within
[01:39:42.340 --> 01:39:47.780]  cities that house Jews and political dissidents during World War two the
[01:39:47.780 --> 01:39:53.060]  restriction or even outlawing of meat something already being vehemently pushed
[01:39:53.060 --> 01:39:56.660]  by eco fascist we have links to them saying it to the point where a hamburger
[01:39:56.660 --> 01:40:00.620]  becomes a rare delicacy to be enjoyed on special occasions yeah the state on your
[01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:05.140]  birthday might give you a little meat and only then if you can afford it well
[01:40:05.140 --> 01:40:10.300]  that sounds like a North Korean prison camp and Watson continues to write as my
[01:40:10.300 --> 01:40:15.540]  wife who is Chinese will attest up until the late 80s before China started to
[01:40:15.540 --> 01:40:20.340]  lift itself out of poverty meat was a rare treat that was sparsely available
[01:40:20.340 --> 01:40:25.020]  and highly restricted again the planned opolis is nothing less than a fusion of
[01:40:25.020 --> 01:40:29.420]  communist and fascist control measures inflicted upon population to keep them
[01:40:29.420 --> 01:40:35.860]  poor starving and weak the people who produced this video funded by the
[01:40:35.860 --> 01:40:39.900]  monolithic elitist bankers and corporations like Royal Dutch Shell Bank
[01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:43.060]  of America as well as British government Paul has a link to this group an
[01:40:43.060 --> 01:40:47.180]  article about who they're funded by know very well that every aspect of their
[01:40:47.180 --> 01:40:51.420]  planned opolis is lifted directly from the most abhorrent and brutal
[01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:55.020]  dictatorships in history and they go on to admit that and they know it they're
[01:40:55.020 --> 01:40:58.700]  very proud of it they are openly flaunting the eco fascist ideology
[01:40:58.700 --> 01:41:03.100]  behind the green movement they now call themselves eco fascist it's a total
[01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:08.260]  embracing of this hitlerian system of course is made clear in the video none
[01:41:08.260 --> 01:41:11.940]  of the regulations or controls will apply to any of the elitist imposing them
[01:41:11.940 --> 01:41:15.980]  on the rest of us see it looks like a joke in that video because it's meant to
[01:41:15.980 --> 01:41:20.620]  flaunt it to break your will think Al Gore and his multiple ocean side
[01:41:20.620 --> 01:41:24.940]  mansions with heated swimming pools they will still be able to roll around in
[01:41:24.940 --> 01:41:29.380]  SUVs and mansions with heated swimming pools they will still be able to again
[01:41:29.380 --> 01:41:33.100]  roll around and fly around their private jets while quaffing the finest
[01:41:33.100 --> 01:41:38.740]  filet steak and belching tons of CO2 as they lecture the rest of humanity about
[01:41:38.740 --> 01:41:42.900]  their carbon footprint think Prince Charles and his insistence that the
[01:41:42.900 --> 01:41:50.100]  proles not be allowed to take a bath as he lounges in a luxuriant splendor of
[01:41:50.100 --> 01:41:56.740]  royal palaces call Watson up there's a phantom s right there at number eight
[01:41:56.740 --> 01:42:02.780]  continuing they are also engaged in a ploy to shift the parameters of the
[01:42:02.780 --> 01:42:06.700]  overton window which is defined as a range of political policies considered
[01:42:06.700 --> 01:42:10.980]  to be politically acceptable in the current climate of public opinion by
[01:42:10.980 --> 01:42:14.980]  constantly bombarding us with extreme interpregnant proposals they gradually
[01:42:14.980 --> 01:42:19.220]  wear down the human psyche until people begin to accept her conan controls over
[01:42:19.220 --> 01:42:23.780]  their personal lives is normal necessary and reasonable the mind is so strong and
[01:42:23.780 --> 01:42:28.180]  ready to face adversity that when you hear about war with Iran coming forever
[01:42:28.180 --> 01:42:31.940]  you subconsciously almost want to see it go ahead and happen or when you hear
[01:42:31.940 --> 01:42:35.660]  about mass die-off of humanity promoted by Discovery Channel and all these shows
[01:42:35.660 --> 01:42:38.980]  and how it's coming you almost want to get it over with see it's a
[01:42:38.980 --> 01:42:44.380]  self-fulfilling prophecy this is part of the reason behind last year's splatter
[01:42:44.380 --> 01:42:47.860]  gate controversy we're global warming alarmists again funded by government and
[01:42:47.860 --> 01:42:51.820]  big business produced an infomercial in which children who refused to lower their
[01:42:51.820 --> 01:42:55.220]  carbon emissions were slaughtered in an orgy of blood and guts we're gonna play
[01:42:55.220 --> 01:43:00.340]  that in a minute this is a psychological attack and a realization of the
[01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:04.300]  stepping stone method of tyranny whereas we might not accept cars being banned or
[01:43:04.300 --> 01:43:08.860]  meat being rationed now we will accept incandescent light bulbs being outlawed
[01:43:08.860 --> 01:43:13.340]  and paying carbon taxes on fuel it's so great about Watson I called up to him
[01:43:13.340 --> 01:43:17.060]  for 10 minutes just spewed information and he just sat there without even
[01:43:17.060 --> 01:43:20.580]  writing notes and spewed it all right back out with precision and then added
[01:43:20.580 --> 01:43:23.620]  his own understanding over later this article and wrote this article in about
[01:43:23.620 --> 01:43:28.900]  30 minutes got a salute Paul Watson what an incredible job I can't believe he got
[01:43:28.900 --> 01:43:32.180]  all of this exactly right spewed at him in a hundred miles an hour as I was
[01:43:32.180 --> 01:43:37.300]  ranting and guzzling coffees walking around in my backyard this is a
[01:43:37.300 --> 01:43:41.900]  psychological attack and a realization of the stepping stone method to tyranny
[01:43:41.900 --> 01:43:45.860]  whereas we might not accept cars being banned and meat being rationed now we
[01:43:45.860 --> 01:43:49.820]  will accept incandescent light bulbs being outlawed and paying carbon taxes on
[01:43:49.820 --> 01:43:54.060]  fuel as each hurdle is cleared the global's proposed something more extreme
[01:43:54.060 --> 01:43:58.740]  so that we will always come to a compromise and accept a slider lesser
[01:43:58.740 --> 01:44:02.780]  tyranny but in the long term the elitist achieve all of their goals with a
[01:44:02.780 --> 01:44:05.340]  plumb
[01:44:05.980 --> 01:44:13.260]  continuing it's good to read a piece that's just so so precise I love exposing
[01:44:13.260 --> 01:44:19.780]  the globalist and to top it all off the debate between the liberals over at the
[01:44:19.780 --> 01:44:25.820]  Guardian website in response to the story did not revolve around a castigation of
[01:44:25.820 --> 01:44:29.580]  the authoritarian future hell but a question on whether old people should
[01:44:29.580 --> 01:44:33.340]  merely be advised by government workers how to kill themselves when they reach
[01:44:33.340 --> 01:44:38.740]  65 or whether the state should just kill them directly member bill joy owner of
[01:44:38.740 --> 01:44:42.620]  some micro systems writing 11 no 12 years ago now how he went to an elitist
[01:44:42.620 --> 01:44:47.220]  meeting of other computer owners billionaires and they had debates all
[01:44:47.220 --> 01:44:53.820]  weekend about do we just kill everyone or do we entertain them and build a false
[01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:57.380]  reality for them because they're not needed because of computers anymore and
[01:44:57.380 --> 01:45:05.340]  robotics human life isn't cheap it's worthless and the decision is that you're
[01:45:05.340 --> 01:45:10.140]  bad for the earth I'm bad so we're dead and now they're just teaching us by
[01:45:10.140 --> 01:45:15.860]  increment how to die remember last year the cover of news week the case for
[01:45:15.860 --> 01:45:22.900]  killing granny oh there's no death panels but we want to kill granny and then I
[01:45:22.900 --> 01:45:25.420]  saw the news week the week before that I could hardly ever even read it so
[01:45:25.420 --> 01:45:28.420]  painful they had a weird article the grim reaper with two old people and how
[01:45:28.420 --> 01:45:33.340]  beautiful it is to commit suicide but the globalist they don't commit suicide
[01:45:33.340 --> 01:45:38.700]  dick cheney has a bionic heart they've added a bionic part onto a pump he's
[01:45:38.700 --> 01:45:43.620]  trying to get a heart transplant right now you notice he's clinging you notice
[01:45:43.620 --> 01:45:49.140]  the big head mr. Jobs of Apple who funds all this eugenics and promotes it
[01:45:49.140 --> 01:45:52.620]  endlessly you notice he got a liver transplant it was a little suspicious
[01:45:52.620 --> 01:45:57.060]  how fast he got it went out to Tennessee to get it no discussion of where that
[01:45:57.060 --> 01:46:04.900]  good he came from I got a good idea oh but he's got something to offer doesn't
[01:46:04.900 --> 01:46:10.140]  mean uh-huh and as if that isn't even enough they're not just wanting to get
[01:46:10.140 --> 01:46:14.300]  rid of the dumb down people which is horrible no their real target is those
[01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:19.460]  that are smart mm-hmm that's why they put a sterile ensign IQ reducers in the
[01:46:19.460 --> 01:46:24.300]  water and see I'm not the smartest person in the world but I've got enough
[01:46:24.300 --> 01:46:27.780]  fight any when people openly write how they're doing that to me I tend to get
[01:46:27.780 --> 01:46:32.660]  mad and I tend to get organized and I tend for 16 years on air to try to build
[01:46:32.660 --> 01:46:38.500]  an info wars weapon system to defend my family and to defend my family I've got
[01:46:38.500 --> 01:46:43.580]  to defend everybody else we all hang together or hang separate I'm getting
[01:46:43.580 --> 01:46:49.300]  chills right now ladies and gentlemen I want to beat these people I want to take
[01:46:49.300 --> 01:46:54.740]  them on I'm going to bring them down but it's going to take you waking up and
[01:46:54.740 --> 01:46:58.780]  getting your guts going getting your good old boy guts turned on and getting
[01:46:58.780 --> 01:47:02.580]  focused you know the enemy loves to teach us that we've already lost we
[01:47:02.580 --> 01:47:07.420]  haven't lost we've won they're taking on a bold operation and they're gonna fail
[01:47:07.420 --> 01:47:13.260]  they will fail 100% if you simply decide to get take action against them
[01:47:13.260 --> 01:47:19.280]  effectively a lot of us have committed ourselves 110% at least you can do is
[01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:26.100]  get active so they go on to debate do we just kill the old people or ask them to
[01:47:26.100 --> 01:47:31.100]  kill themselves this is all being openly discussed and it's all liberal it's all
[01:47:31.100 --> 01:47:35.940]  loving killing people this kind of despotic destiny is not only being
[01:47:35.940 --> 01:47:40.620]  pushed by the elite it has an army of greenwash zombies behind it who have
[01:47:40.620 --> 01:47:48.780]  been recruited to make the demon side of the elderly to useless eaters an
[01:47:48.780 --> 01:47:53.100]  intellectually acceptable and reasonable idea presumably the disabled and
[01:47:53.100 --> 01:47:56.420]  the mentally ill will also be exterminated in the pursuit of the
[01:47:56.420 --> 01:48:00.460]  highly efficient planned opolis another idea of which Hitler would have
[01:48:00.460 --> 01:48:04.580]  vehemently approved you actually designed with Albert Spear the the mega
[01:48:04.580 --> 01:48:07.820]  cities and the environmental grid meat would not be allowed you will not be
[01:48:07.820 --> 01:48:13.500]  allowed I mean it's it's total it's all happening just cops are laughing right
[01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:15.580]  now because they've been preconditioned just go ahead laugh while you want go
[01:48:15.580 --> 01:48:18.260]  ahead left you're part of the structure you're gonna win aren't you no you're
[01:48:18.260 --> 01:48:21.980]  not gonna win you're already being killed once government is given the power
[01:48:21.980 --> 01:48:26.980]  to kill anyone they deem to be unproductive this collectivist or
[01:48:26.980 --> 01:48:31.460]  welly and nightmare the gates of hell are now thrown wide open in comparison
[01:48:31.460 --> 01:48:35.380]  meat rationing carbon taxes eco surveillance calorie credits and
[01:48:35.380 --> 01:48:39.860]  transport restriction will seem like a walk in the park Alex Jones seminal
[01:48:39.860 --> 01:48:45.380]  film in-game release in 06 produced in 06 released early 07 worn precisely the
[01:48:45.380 --> 01:48:49.100]  kind of high-tech slave grids being implemented that are now routinely
[01:48:49.100 --> 01:48:52.940]  proposed by top eco fascist organizations we urge you to warn
[01:48:52.940 --> 01:48:57.540]  everyone you know about this agenda and it's the dominant agenda it's in place
[01:48:57.540 --> 01:49:02.820]  it's being executed and to stand up in unison to resist the first great
[01:49:02.820 --> 01:49:06.740]  assault on human liberty in the 21st century which is now certain to be
[01:49:06.740 --> 01:49:10.980]  inflicted upon us under the guise of saving mother earth while the global
[01:49:10.980 --> 01:49:14.540]  is butchered with all the genetic engineering we either stop this now or
[01:49:14.540 --> 01:49:20.140]  we end up on the eco ghettos and the masters have readied for us in their
[01:49:20.140 --> 01:49:31.260]  planned opolis what do I say in the film in game what do I have it's an image of
[01:49:31.260 --> 01:49:34.700]  the UN building with a big skull on it with all the flags of the countries
[01:49:34.700 --> 01:49:41.700]  removed and on the back what does it say they want you dead they want you dead
[01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:45.580]  and these crooks sit there in line say there were no death panels when they've
[01:49:45.580 --> 01:49:55.140]  been in place in Europe for decades they tell these idiot yuppies Bill Gates gets
[01:49:55.140 --> 01:50:02.700]  up we're gonna play that clip after the break Bill Gates gets up on television
[01:50:02.700 --> 01:50:06.460]  and says do we hire 10 teachers or lay them off or do we not give grandma care
[01:50:06.460 --> 01:50:09.820]  and then the people hearing that the dumb 30 year old teachers they think
[01:50:09.820 --> 01:50:14.020]  well yeah kill granny I want money as if it's not an endless pie that just
[01:50:14.020 --> 01:50:17.580]  expands the first thing that each collectivist is that the pie is a some set
[01:50:17.580 --> 01:50:22.020]  game so that somebody's got to lose for you to win not win win win win win go to
[01:50:22.020 --> 01:50:26.580]  the stars they produce videos for children saying leaving earth is a
[01:50:26.580 --> 01:50:31.860]  scourge humans are a disease we mustn't leave teaching you you're worthless
[01:50:31.860 --> 01:50:35.820]  what do I say here on the back of endgame for the new world order a world
[01:50:35.820 --> 01:50:40.700]  government is just the beginning once in place they can engage their plan to
[01:50:40.700 --> 01:50:45.100]  exterminate 80% of the world's population while enabling the elites to
[01:50:45.100 --> 01:50:50.020]  live forever with the aid of advanced technology this film was shocking three
[01:50:50.020 --> 01:50:55.540]  years ago four years ago it is now prescient because I read their own

[01:52:02.660 --> 01:52:06.580]  global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the
[01:52:06.580 --> 01:52:10.580]  Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become
[01:52:10.580 --> 01:52:14.220]  more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds and I'll perform even gold
[01:52:14.220 --> 01:52:17.300]  and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen
[01:52:17.300 --> 01:52:21.420]  again so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect
[01:52:21.420 --> 01:52:26.820]  mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an
[01:52:26.820 --> 01:52:30.860]  endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family and here's the
[01:52:30.860 --> 01:52:34.820]  best part these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you
[01:52:34.820 --> 01:52:38.900]  actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden so visit them
[01:52:38.900 --> 01:52:43.900]  today at survival seed bank dot com that's survival seed bank dot com or give
[01:52:43.900 --> 01:52:54.260]  them a call at 877-327-0365 that's 877-327-0365 remember in a real crisis
[01:52:54.260 --> 01:52:58.380]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item this is Alex Jones for
[01:52:58.380 --> 01:53:02.580]  survival seed bank dot com normal blood pressure naturally how would that make
[01:53:02.580 --> 01:53:08.060]  you feel I'm Don from the Mexican January of 2000 I had a heart attack then my real
[01:53:08.060 --> 01:53:12.660]  health began going downhill and I had high blood pressure high blood sugar and
[01:53:12.660 --> 01:53:16.820]  poor vision and I really wasn't sleeping well I was a mess pretty much Don
[01:53:16.820 --> 01:53:20.740]  reports dramatic improvements with heart and body extract I started taking heart
[01:53:20.740 --> 01:53:25.060]  and body extract and within a few days I started sleeping a lot better my blood
[01:53:25.060 --> 01:53:29.380]  pressure normalized my blood sugar normalized and my sleep really did
[01:53:29.380 --> 01:53:32.860]  improve experience these benefits and more when your body gets what it needs
[01:53:32.860 --> 01:53:37.220]  with the assistance of heart and body extract order at HB extract dot com or
[01:53:37.220 --> 01:53:46.780]  call 866-295-5305 that's HB extract dot com or call 866-295-5305 folks I did not
[01:53:46.780 --> 01:53:50.700]  expect this at all by the 7th 8th and 9th day I saw dramatic improvements from
[01:53:50.700 --> 01:53:57.740]  taking heart and body extract details at HB extract dot com or call 866-295-5305
[01:53:57.740 --> 01:54:11.620]  for heart and body extract
[01:54:11.620 --> 01:54:16.420]  I know it's pretty scary when I'm covering but it's a fact and remember how nuts I
[01:54:16.420 --> 01:54:20.380]  sounded just a few years ago covering this because I was reading UN reports and
[01:54:20.380 --> 01:54:25.700]  Club of Rome and CFR where they were admitting geoengineering global
[01:54:25.700 --> 01:54:31.140]  population reductions face-scanning cameras infrared satellites tracking our
[01:54:31.140 --> 01:54:37.420]  individual infrared signatures now and I'm gonna get into this next hour or
[01:54:37.420 --> 01:54:42.940]  now and what it's just oh yeah I'm you know associated press Germany deploying
[01:54:42.940 --> 01:54:47.860]  secret spy satellites they claimed it was for the environment but really it's
[01:54:47.860 --> 01:54:54.140]  infrared images are scanning your body Detroit public schools give 40,000 kids
[01:54:54.140 --> 01:54:58.540]  laptops with stimulus funds of course the laptops will be used to watch you
[01:54:58.540 --> 01:55:03.260]  at home now it's just yeah we do that here's the New York Times incredible
[01:55:03.260 --> 01:55:10.300]  article computers that see what you keep computers that see you and keep watch
[01:55:10.300 --> 01:55:15.620]  over you computers that see you and keep watch over you and then it goes on to
[01:55:15.620 --> 01:55:21.220]  say computers not to surveil you but AI computers designed by DARPA to make sure
[01:55:21.220 --> 01:55:25.820]  you washed your hands right to make sure you're feeding your kid to make sure
[01:55:25.820 --> 01:55:31.620]  you're not giving your kid tea that's too hot I mean they actually say it
[01:55:31.620 --> 01:55:36.260]  everything it's going in smart meters are going in Austin where I live the
[01:55:36.260 --> 01:55:39.900]  control your thermostats I mean it and they admit it I mean it's just total
[01:55:39.900 --> 01:55:45.700]  control they're just doing it federalization CIA run spy centers and
[01:55:45.700 --> 01:55:51.100]  it's run by a government caught staging terror attacks and then they put ads out
[01:55:51.100 --> 01:55:55.140]  and say we're extreme for not liking this message that children will be
[01:55:55.140 --> 01:56:00.340]  murdered that's the message shown to school kids if they don't submit to the
[01:56:00.340 --> 01:56:04.900]  carbon tax that's the message we will kill you but then in the end game it is
[01:56:04.900 --> 01:56:08.540]  to kill them they're teaching that it's like a bloodthirsty fetish that it's a
[01:56:08.540 --> 01:56:13.140]  power trip of all these throngs of in viral zombies that couldn't get a job
[01:56:13.140 --> 01:56:18.140]  couldn't build anything just lazy people who will now be the eco-fascist
[01:56:18.140 --> 01:56:22.660]  green-cop enforcers let's go ahead and play the club of a murdering children and
[01:56:22.660 --> 01:56:27.380]  they show this to school kids here it is right kids just before you go there's a
[01:56:27.380 --> 01:56:32.460]  brilliant idea in the air that I'd like to run by you now it's called 1010 the
[01:56:32.460 --> 01:56:38.860]  idea is everyone starts cutting their carbon emissions by 10% thus keeping the
[01:56:38.860 --> 01:56:43.340]  planet safe for everyone eventually now this hasn't got to be a huge thing but I
[01:56:43.340 --> 01:56:48.180]  would love it if you and your families would think about doing something what
[01:56:48.180 --> 01:56:54.700]  sort of thing miss well like getting your dad to insulate the loft or taking
[01:56:54.700 --> 01:56:58.020]  your next holiday by train see after they set the precedent with a reasonable
[01:56:58.020 --> 01:57:03.420]  sounding things then it's we're thinking of using our car less I'm going to cycle
[01:57:03.420 --> 01:57:07.860]  school see we're thinking but then it's law now no pressure at all but it'd be
[01:57:07.860 --> 01:57:12.260]  great to get a sense of how many in viral surveillance rough percentage that's
[01:57:12.260 --> 01:57:19.460]  fantastic no pressure at all but he's about to kill him Philip and Tracy you're
[01:57:19.460 --> 01:57:23.940]  dead fine that's absolutely fine your own choice okay class thank you so much
[01:57:23.940 --> 01:57:29.620]  for today and I will see you all tomorrow oh just before you go I just
[01:57:29.620 --> 01:57:40.300]  need to press oh it's little button here oh everybody please remember to read
[01:57:40.300 --> 01:57:44.380]  chapters 5 and 6 the murdering continues for another three minutes we don't have
[01:57:44.380 --> 01:57:50.740]  time to play at all but the issue here is this was government funded now it's
[01:57:50.740 --> 01:57:55.580]  got so many layers of propaganda it's like a 50 layer cake but it's peer
[01:57:55.580 --> 01:57:59.260]  pressure for kids the message is you'll be murdered by your authority figure
[01:57:59.260 --> 01:58:08.580]  teacher if you don't submit to this and it brutalizes the mind and it teaches you
[01:58:08.580 --> 01:58:16.940]  that murdering is good if it's state run and this is all they're playing and when
[01:58:16.940 --> 01:58:20.780]  you run into these weird glazed-eyed biological androids who were into this
[01:58:20.780 --> 01:58:24.540]  they'll go that's right we are gonna do that they giggle like they're part of it
[01:58:24.540 --> 01:58:29.180]  as they drink a glass of water at the restaurant filled with sodium fluoride
[01:58:29.180 --> 01:58:32.980]  hundreds of other deadly chemicals on record put in there hurt them and even
[01:58:32.980 --> 01:58:36.540]  if they admit it they kind of get off on it so to all of you going you kill
[01:58:36.540 --> 01:58:41.940]  yourselves first not me and my kids understand trash America's number one
[01:58:41.940 --> 01:58:48.980]  source for independent talk radio for over a decade we are the GCN radio
[01:58:48.980 --> 01:58:53.780]  network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[01:58:53.780 --> 01:58:58.140]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[01:58:58.140 --> 01:59:02.300]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[01:59:02.300 --> 01:59:06.340]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[01:59:06.340 --> 01:59:10.220]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:59:10.220 --> 01:59:14.500]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:59:14.500 --> 01:59:18.660]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:59:18.660 --> 01:59:22.980]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:59:22.980 --> 01:59:26.660]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages number
[01:59:26.660 --> 01:59:30.860]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[01:59:30.860 --> 01:59:34.220]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution
[01:59:34.220 --> 01:59:40.420]  from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[01:59:40.420 --> 01:59:44.380]  that's my solar back up dot com remember the government doesn't own the sun
[01:59:44.380 --> 01:59:54.740]  so go to my solar back up dot com or call 1-877-327-0365 waging war on
[01:59:54.740 --> 02:00:00.820]  corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:00:04.660 --> 02:00:12.380]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:12.380 --> 02:00:19.940]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:19.940 --> 02:00:25.820]  Alex Jones you see the globalist have to teach you through psychological warfare
[02:00:25.820 --> 02:00:32.820]  that dying is cool that hating yourself is stylish I mean if they can make women
[02:00:32.820 --> 02:00:37.580]  dress more clownishly each year after the other because it's the style well they
[02:00:37.580 --> 02:00:40.620]  just tell you it's the style to hate yourself and not have a survival instinct
[02:00:40.620 --> 02:00:46.260]  they lie to you and don't tell you that the entire West is dying with a 1.3 on
[02:00:46.260 --> 02:00:50.300]  average replacement rate places like Singapore 1.2 for every two adults
[02:00:50.300 --> 02:00:54.100]  they're having 1.2 children they don't tell you the earth's gonna plane out at
[02:00:54.100 --> 02:00:59.060]  around 8 million 300 million in 2020 that's the UN zone numbers will probably
[02:00:59.060 --> 02:01:02.860]  be less they don't tell you that when you fly in an aircraft you notice that
[02:01:02.860 --> 02:01:08.460]  humans congregate in compact cities already naturally because of commerce they
[02:01:08.460 --> 02:01:12.020]  don't tell you that if they just industrialized the third world there
[02:01:12.020 --> 02:01:16.540]  wouldn't be an overpopulation issue they don't care about toxic technologies
[02:01:16.540 --> 02:01:19.020]  they don't care about real environmental threats they care about
[02:01:19.020 --> 02:01:23.100]  collectivizing everything and getting control of your life and then
[02:01:23.100 --> 02:01:27.820]  euthanizing your butt controlling how many kids you can have and this is their
[02:01:27.820 --> 02:01:33.540]  stated admission I mean reading Watson's article you go through it and link to all
[02:01:33.540 --> 02:01:37.260]  the mainstream articles where they're exposing themselves saying I love
[02:01:37.260 --> 02:01:42.300]  fascism kill everyone humans are a disease these are hateful scum who can
[02:01:42.300 --> 02:01:48.700]  only operate inside of academia and then are funded by the mega rich dr. Eric
[02:01:48.700 --> 02:01:53.940]  Pionka I know the airborne Ebola is coming soon it will kill 99% of us I'm
[02:01:53.940 --> 02:01:57.820]  kind of sad my wife and children are ready to die but we're already it'll be
[02:01:57.820 --> 02:02:03.820]  here soon in the biology department then I get threatening emails over the years
[02:02:03.820 --> 02:02:07.780]  from his graduate students and they'll say here's my paper on it graduate
[02:02:07.780 --> 02:02:12.140]  student 10 years ago and then you search the woman's name or the man's name and
[02:02:12.140 --> 02:02:16.340]  they're all in bio weapons they're all working for the government and lab coats
[02:02:16.340 --> 02:02:22.540]  with crazed eyes they just get off on it they just like like demons flapping
[02:02:22.540 --> 02:02:27.740]  around a flame of destruction you know they just love the entire system they
[02:02:27.740 --> 02:02:34.260]  love it they love thinking about killing people it's real sexy and cool fact
[02:02:34.260 --> 02:02:37.820]  the other night Rob was showing me on Netflix up here on his computer I think
[02:02:37.820 --> 02:02:41.940]  it's called afterlife called Jacobson in here all he rose around the building
[02:02:41.940 --> 02:02:45.620]  talking to people you call him in here because are you maybe on the phone with
[02:02:45.620 --> 02:02:49.500]  Watson right now I forget the name of the movie it's a Nielsen Leslie Nielsen or
[02:02:49.500 --> 02:02:54.020]  whatever his name is it's all how sexy it is to die and how fun and humans are
[02:02:54.020 --> 02:02:58.820]  all trash and scum and it's best that most of us die because most people are
[02:02:58.820 --> 02:03:05.180]  already dead right now most people already deserve it and it's wonderful I
[02:03:05.180 --> 02:03:09.820]  mean these people are so abhorrent so against all common sense of all cultures
[02:03:09.820 --> 02:03:14.180]  that came before us but they're telling us that everything's good that
[02:03:14.180 --> 02:03:17.780]  everything is good that everything that is wholesome come on in Rob they tell
[02:03:17.780 --> 02:03:22.220]  me to come on in what was the name of that movie you watch and you had me
[02:03:22.220 --> 02:03:26.100]  watch 10 minutes of the other night called afterlife and you like the girl
[02:03:26.100 --> 02:03:31.780]  in it what's her name Christina Ricci Christina Ricci and then and then and
[02:03:31.780 --> 02:03:36.780]  then Leslie Niel a Liam Neeson Liam Neeson Liam Neeson yeah and I watched
[02:03:36.780 --> 02:03:40.140]  like 10 minutes of it you showed me the clips it's all how we're all scum and
[02:03:40.140 --> 02:03:44.660]  eugenics is good and dying is wonderful it's all sexy to be in a coffin and who
[02:03:44.660 --> 02:03:51.300]  it's so good yeah really glamorizing death and how death is a you know oh I'm
[02:03:51.300 --> 02:03:55.260]  so happy to be finally dead life wasn't good anymore and they teach death
[02:03:55.260 --> 02:03:58.380]  education in the junior highs I wonder why the little girls are committing
[02:03:58.380 --> 02:04:02.340]  suicide at record numbers and they know Prozac massively increases suicide and
[02:04:02.340 --> 02:04:06.740]  they say oh more Prozac and then there's more suicide and you know I've got
[02:04:06.740 --> 02:04:10.260]  daughters I've got a son I'm tired of this evil I'm tired of them teaching them
[02:04:10.260 --> 02:04:14.220]  death is good so they will submit to tyranny I'm sick of these sickos and
[02:04:14.220 --> 02:04:18.620]  it's time for good people to defeat them movie was really frightening and how
[02:04:18.620 --> 02:04:23.460]  convincing it could be for talking somebody into committing suicide it was
[02:04:23.460 --> 02:04:26.180]  really dark well that's why suicide goes up and up they teach you how great it is
[02:04:26.180 --> 02:04:29.980]  really oh little girls don't commit suicide now we're gonna have weeks and
[02:04:29.980 --> 02:04:34.420]  weeks of classes how you do it and then it just goes off the chart it
[02:04:34.420 --> 02:04:37.540]  introduces them an idea oh you're a little depressed over zits on your face
[02:04:37.540 --> 02:04:41.460]  there's prozac known to cause suicide now we're gonna teach you how to commit
[02:04:41.460 --> 02:04:47.460]  suicide but don't do it oh and the mindless teacher compartmentalized
[02:04:47.460 --> 02:04:50.460]  doesn't even know what they're doing they're teaching children how to kill
[02:04:50.460 --> 02:04:54.340]  themselves this is the mastery of the new world order teaching you that death
[02:04:54.340 --> 02:04:59.260]  is life that that that that slavery is freedom we'll be right back with Alan

[02:06:59.460 --> 02:07:04.900]  a very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the
[02:07:04.900 --> 02:07:09.180]  most important day in America in more than 50 years he says it will change

[02:07:19.700 --> 02:07:24.340]  part is he's usually right you see he predicted the collapse of GM Danny May
[02:07:24.340 --> 02:07:28.220]  Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall owner general growth properties in fact
[02:07:28.220 --> 02:07:32.860]  Barron's called his work a dire prophecy recently he created a video which
[02:07:32.860 --> 02:07:36.020]  you can watch online for free detailing his biggest and most important
[02:07:36.020 --> 02:07:39.980]  prediction yet and it's a real eye-opener I can't stress this enough you

[02:08:12.580 --> 02:08:20.100]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:08:20.100 --> 02:08:23.740]  Alex Jones
[02:08:29.740 --> 02:08:36.500]  well Alan Watt is an amazing researcher and he's also radio talk show host and
[02:08:36.500 --> 02:08:41.380]  we always find it very informative to have him on with us he's on with us for
[02:08:41.380 --> 02:08:44.980]  five minutes in the next hour that we have a top meteorologist on has been
[02:08:44.980 --> 02:08:49.580]  accurately predicting these frozen wasteland ice age winners and he's
[02:08:49.580 --> 02:08:54.380]  getting the credit that is due but the last two hours yeah we've got Berthers
[02:08:54.380 --> 02:08:58.380]  screaming during the reading of the Constitution that Obama isn't a
[02:08:58.380 --> 02:09:03.580]  natural born we've got drones coming to Miami-Dade County and we've got the big
[02:09:03.580 --> 02:09:09.260]  announcements that they're building giant DARPA face scanning camera centers
[02:09:09.260 --> 02:09:13.780]  everywhere and giant NSA databases just we've got announcements that the
[02:09:13.780 --> 02:09:17.620]  government spying on all its employees right now with warrantless wiretaps I
[02:09:17.620 --> 02:09:23.260]  mean it's just it's total evil being released as they try to break our will
[02:09:23.260 --> 02:09:26.780]  and condition us but for the last two hours I've been talking about Paul
[02:09:26.780 --> 02:09:32.260]  Joseph Watson's articles eco fascist call for prison cities and the other
[02:09:32.260 --> 02:09:37.860]  article on the same similar subject planned opolis a lead us agenda for eco
[02:09:37.860 --> 02:09:43.420]  enslavement now Alan Watt I want to hear your expertise on this but my basic
[02:09:43.420 --> 02:09:49.300]  boil down is this there is an attempt to rebrand dystopia as mother's milk to
[02:09:49.300 --> 02:09:52.580]  show children being murdered by their teachers and it being a good thing was
[02:09:52.580 --> 02:09:56.420]  they don't submit to the earth open announcements that we should just kill
[02:09:56.420 --> 02:10:01.180]  all people over 65 a Logan's run carousel London Guardian you name it I
[02:10:01.180 --> 02:10:06.420]  mean they are saying we are Nazis we are fascist they are saying yes it's
[02:10:06.420 --> 02:10:12.140]  eugenics they are just flaunting it I guess to change the
[02:10:12.140 --> 02:10:16.700]  Overton window to to be so extreme that the sky is in the limit and somehow
[02:10:16.700 --> 02:10:21.220]  break our will I believe it's backfiring on them but we are doing the search
[02:10:21.220 --> 02:10:26.940]  terms today prison cities eco fascist and prison planet comm eco cities is
[02:10:26.940 --> 02:10:31.260]  number one search eco fascist number two search prison planet com number three
[02:10:31.260 --> 02:10:34.540]  search please make them all number one number two number three let's smash the
[02:10:34.540 --> 02:10:37.780]  enemy you will decide which one is number one by how many times you put it
[02:10:37.780 --> 02:10:41.340]  into Google and then hit re-enter over and over again but they are really
[02:10:41.340 --> 02:10:45.180]  coming out with the world government with just all of it is it because
[02:10:45.180 --> 02:10:49.260]  alternative media has checkmated them or brought them into check exposing their
[02:10:49.260 --> 02:10:55.020]  agenda and so stonewalling doesn't work or is it just simply to psychologically
[02:10:55.020 --> 02:11:00.300]  overwhelm us with the flaunting and it's all delivered in a jibbering giggling
[02:11:00.300 --> 02:11:09.340]  way by these psychopathic people engaged in this public orgy as they
[02:11:09.340 --> 02:11:15.180]  prepare for a mass bloodthirsty feast Alan Watt what is your take on them
[02:11:15.180 --> 02:11:18.940]  going into warp drive or do you agree they're going into warp drive oh they
[02:11:18.940 --> 02:11:24.140]  are but it's on plan this is part of the agenda they go by an educational
[02:11:24.140 --> 02:11:30.220]  timetable and they go by five year plans for children it will be five now ten
[02:11:30.220 --> 02:11:34.340]  and a few years and and how they are going to perceive their new world
[02:11:34.340 --> 02:11:37.780]  they're getting ready for it now they're training them for it now to be quite
[02:11:37.780 --> 02:11:41.860]  normal and so this is just the educational part it's time to implement
[02:11:41.860 --> 02:11:46.900]  the stage of the agenda they know exactly how much to push of course because
[02:11:46.900 --> 02:11:51.820]  they've all been prepared as all for the present agenda and we accept it we're
[02:11:51.820 --> 02:11:55.180]  always prepared in advance for everything that comes along mainly through
[02:11:55.180 --> 02:12:00.340]  little bits and bytes of information from scientific expose and on the media
[02:12:00.340 --> 02:12:05.820]  and we also get it through all fiction all fiction has it in it now that the
[02:12:05.820 --> 02:12:11.100]  coming system yet to live into and for more thirty years now sci-fi has been
[02:12:11.100 --> 02:12:17.220]  pouring out this dystopic future with a small group elite running the world a
[02:12:17.220 --> 02:12:21.420]  scientific elite of course always a scientific elite who are in charge of
[02:12:21.420 --> 02:12:26.060]  all food rationing and so on who have a very good life by the way and then is
[02:12:26.060 --> 02:12:30.180]  the ones the masses who are still working for them in their closed cities
[02:12:30.180 --> 02:12:33.860]  where they're dependent upon that their masters for everything as long as they
[02:12:33.860 --> 02:12:38.340]  told the line and China actually has those closed cities for their worker
[02:12:38.340 --> 02:12:42.020]  drones who are even locked in their neighborhoods at night meanwhile the
[02:12:42.020 --> 02:12:45.620]  globalists are doing everything they can to shut off the resources while telling
[02:12:45.620 --> 02:12:49.100]  us that it's naturally happening but then we have all their own manuals
[02:12:49.100 --> 02:12:54.340]  admitting it please continue yeah and it's all done by stages where they
[02:12:54.340 --> 02:12:59.620]  introduce new crisis as crisis after crisis and you think about life before
[02:12:59.620 --> 02:13:05.340]  9-11 happened it was fairly fairly static to an extent and that no major
[02:13:05.340 --> 02:13:08.980]  changes and drastic changes are not telling a whole bunch of them all at
[02:13:08.980 --> 02:13:13.660]  once and since 9-11 it's been crisis after crisis after crisis and this is
[02:13:13.660 --> 02:13:17.740]  the technique of a revolution is their revolution not ours and they're bringing
[02:13:17.740 --> 02:13:22.860]  the last phase into to being and this phase of course will last up to the year
[02:13:22.860 --> 02:13:28.500]  2050 or so as they drastically reduce the population again through food
[02:13:28.500 --> 02:13:32.580]  rationing but this is not new because the United Nations was set up really to
[02:13:32.580 --> 02:13:36.220]  help coordinate all of this you know you need a massive well the British 200 years
[02:13:36.220 --> 02:13:39.660]  ago developed the reservation concentration camp model and then it
[02:13:39.660 --> 02:13:43.500]  was used on the Native Americans and then we have the British manuals that
[02:13:43.500 --> 02:13:46.860]  are in the Library of Congress how to give them the smallpox blankets how to
[02:13:46.860 --> 02:13:52.100]  open the wounds of the soldiers on to it was put out lots of instruction book was
[02:13:52.100 --> 02:13:56.220]  educational book was for the British Empire how to run their colonies how
[02:13:56.220 --> 02:14:01.860]  to keep their peasants at a working level but not too bright too strong to
[02:14:01.860 --> 02:14:05.620]  walk off at night to run away and so that they had the whole diet scheme
[02:14:05.620 --> 02:14:09.580]  figured out that's why diet is very important to it and that's why rationing
[02:14:09.580 --> 02:14:14.020]  is coming in to help us get to that stage strong enough to be kind of
[02:14:14.020 --> 02:14:19.220]  pliable and workable but not too smart enough to do anything about it and this
[02:14:19.220 --> 02:14:22.940]  is all part of it too so that was introduced into the British Commonwealth
[02:14:22.940 --> 02:14:27.620]  that's right they have manuals on how omnivores are less aggressive when
[02:14:27.620 --> 02:14:31.900]  they're mainly on the vegetarian diet but that we're designed and triggered
[02:14:31.900 --> 02:14:36.660]  under especially a red meat diet with the hormonal endocrine interfaces to
[02:14:36.660 --> 02:14:40.540]  become more predatory and aggressive they don't want that for us they want us
[02:14:40.540 --> 02:14:46.700]  docile grass-eating creatures for them to more easily roll over us oh yeah and
[02:14:46.700 --> 02:14:50.660]  they talked when Britain went to India they talked an awful lot with the
[02:14:50.660 --> 02:14:54.380]  Brahmins very interested in their culture because the Brahmins had kept that
[02:14:54.380 --> 02:14:59.500]  very system working India for thousands of years and so the people were taught
[02:14:59.500 --> 02:15:04.820]  religion that made them vegetarian and you also restrict of course even what
[02:15:04.820 --> 02:15:09.340]  you give them for a vegetarian which makes them even more pliable and not
[02:15:09.340 --> 02:15:12.900]  too bright they go down to a perfect science they know everything that you
[02:15:12.900 --> 02:15:16.260]  need to eat to keep you bright and healthy that's right the anthropology
[02:15:16.260 --> 02:15:21.260]  and archaeology and biology shows that the brain CC wise begins to grow even
[02:15:21.260 --> 02:15:26.260]  larger with even just a few generations on a red meat diet because it has the
[02:15:26.260 --> 02:15:31.380]  fats and oils needed for brain development for the British they don't
[02:15:31.380 --> 02:15:35.980]  the British soldiers in World War one they were never fed properly before
[02:15:35.980 --> 02:15:39.300]  they became soldiers they came from all walks of life generally that the
[02:15:39.300 --> 02:15:43.100]  industrial towns and cities where meat was pretty expensive very expensive and
[02:15:43.100 --> 02:15:47.940]  very scarce for them and within the first they found within the first the
[02:15:47.940 --> 02:15:54.500]  average recruit was five to three by the way at age of 16 17 18 and within three
[02:15:54.500 --> 02:15:59.060]  months of getting a high protein and meat diets he was brought between three
[02:15:59.060 --> 02:16:03.940]  and six inches and that's how starved they were so always been tested out on
[02:16:03.940 --> 02:16:08.140]  populations before including Britain and they had to give a mate to get them
[02:16:08.140 --> 02:16:11.740]  ready to kill because the Germans were gobbling Nate and understood that it's
[02:16:11.740 --> 02:16:15.940]  all scientific so so right now they're really rushing all this out it's been
[02:16:15.940 --> 02:16:20.380]  accelerating since the stage event of 9-11 but in the last year it's like they
[02:16:20.380 --> 02:16:25.700]  put the afterburners on I mean they are just out in mainline news saying we're
[02:16:25.700 --> 02:16:29.620]  gonna kill you at 65 they're not even denying death panels now they're saying
[02:16:29.620 --> 02:16:33.260]  we're going to kill you I mean we are murderers they are saying we are
[02:16:33.260 --> 02:16:37.540]  murderers you've had the writeouts in the British papers again Britain is the
[02:16:37.540 --> 02:16:41.380]  flagship for the world to follow remember and they're talking about putting
[02:16:41.380 --> 02:16:46.580]  up euthanasia both street corners very much like you saw in silent green where
[02:16:46.580 --> 02:16:49.660]  you just get rolled in here some classical or children of man they're
[02:16:49.660 --> 02:16:54.300]  getting us all ready for the suicide mm-hmm oh yeah and so yeah there's a
[02:16:54.300 --> 02:16:59.100]  scientific dictatorship this was all promoted by Bertrand Russell who who
[02:16:59.100 --> 02:17:02.780]  helped set up the system we're living through now he's a big promoter he
[02:17:02.780 --> 02:17:06.700]  attended all the think tanks put forward a lot survived years along with albus
[02:17:06.700 --> 02:17:12.500]  Huxley and his brother Julian Huxley from the nation's UNESCO and they talked
[02:17:12.500 --> 02:17:15.100]  about they had it all planned out for this phase that we're going through now
[02:17:15.100 --> 02:17:20.380]  how the society would be turned into a society where they'd be very little
[02:17:20.380 --> 02:17:24.580]  marriage at all massive prompt promiscuity but very little births and
[02:17:24.580 --> 02:17:28.220]  that that was supposed to be encouraged of course they've done that they've been
[02:17:28.220 --> 02:17:32.660]  successful with all of that and everyone's divided now no one's got a
[02:17:32.660 --> 02:17:37.140]  family to stand up for them anymore so government is the boss and so now they
[02:17:37.140 --> 02:17:40.660]  can just rampage ahead with all that's right that's why the Romans had to build
[02:17:40.660 --> 02:17:45.020]  that wall in central England because they could never conquer the Scots the
[02:17:45.020 --> 02:17:48.580]  only group that they could never conquer because they were so family tribal
[02:17:48.580 --> 02:17:52.900]  oriented kind of like afghans they would die before they did it but now the
[02:17:52.900 --> 02:17:56.820]  Scots have been brought to heal quite nicely oh yeah well again through the
[02:17:56.820 --> 02:18:03.100]  diets again they were ruled by London for a few hundred years still are and again
[02:18:03.100 --> 02:18:06.740]  too we're going to understand the basic premise as well from all of this is how
[02:18:06.740 --> 02:18:12.260]  they pick the leaders of countries and those who are the politicians who are
[02:18:12.260 --> 02:18:18.020]  still lower level but they're higher level than we'll generally see there
[02:18:18.020 --> 02:18:22.660]  are scotans a very masonic country you couldn't get a job in Scotland they
[02:18:22.660 --> 02:18:26.340]  would pay any kind of money unless you're a Freemason and it's the same thing in
[02:18:26.340 --> 02:18:30.180]  this system too that the higher Freemasons are picked out at university
[02:18:30.180 --> 02:18:35.420]  level especially Ivy League and if they're if you're an operative Mason that
[02:18:35.420 --> 02:18:39.100]  means that you must attend every meeting when you're called I could be three in
[02:18:39.100 --> 02:18:42.740]  the morning whenever to show you're very eager and that's how they pick the
[02:18:42.740 --> 02:18:46.820]  future prime ministers etc and politicians the ones who'll get up and
[02:18:46.820 --> 02:18:51.900]  be an operative Mason do what they're told never ask why and never ask the
[02:18:51.900 --> 02:18:56.320]  consequences of what they're actually all the modern presidents prime ministers
[02:18:56.320 --> 02:19:03.420]  MI5 MI6 CIA Sarkozy in France all of them Vladimir Putin they're just all
[02:19:03.420 --> 02:19:08.460]  secret society agents yes and they must to prove their worth that's the whole
[02:19:08.460 --> 02:19:11.100]  case with it they're going to be eager they're going to show that they can go
[02:19:11.100 --> 02:19:15.420]  to parties and not get too drunk they must not be a loose lip because they're
[02:19:15.420 --> 02:19:20.820]  monitored more than anyone else you see the system is based in a more on the
[02:19:20.820 --> 02:19:26.780]  Soviet system and a hyper Soviet system they've announced in the
[02:19:26.780 --> 02:19:32.100]  declassified records of Russia that's there was so many dossies on all the
[02:19:32.100 --> 02:19:36.060]  bureaucrats working for the Soviet system way more than the average person
[02:19:36.060 --> 02:19:40.300]  the pro at the bottom because they make sure that those are the ones just like
[02:19:40.300 --> 02:19:45.540]  George Orwell showed you in 1984 those are the ones who must be gung-ho and
[02:19:45.540 --> 02:19:49.620]  always put on the good face for the party believe in the party that kind of
[02:19:49.620 --> 02:19:53.580]  thing and their telephone calls everything was monitored stay there
[02:19:53.580 --> 02:19:57.380]  we've had a bomb go off we told you the feds we're getting ready to start
[02:19:57.380 --> 02:20:02.540]  detonating those all over hold it right back this is Alex Jones with five good
[02:20:02.540 --> 02:20:06.540]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new

[02:20:18.660 --> 02:20:22.900]  name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[02:20:22.900 --> 02:20:26.900]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[02:20:26.900 --> 02:20:31.020]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather

[02:23:57.580 --> 02:24:00.580]  in the secret
[02:24:06.140 --> 02:24:11.380]  so the naked body scanners go in 9,000 locations getting telescreens at
[02:24:11.380 --> 02:24:15.780]  Walmart and malls with Janet DePoletano and government messages about spying on
[02:24:15.780 --> 02:24:19.300]  your neighbors the last six years they've trained local police in every
[02:24:19.300 --> 02:24:24.180]  county and city that domestic non al-qaeda will start blowing up the
[02:24:24.180 --> 02:24:28.780]  courthouses everywhere and then magically it happens and I was watching
[02:24:28.780 --> 02:24:33.300]  body of lies with Russell Crowe and Leonardo DiCaprio this morning while I
[02:24:33.300 --> 02:24:37.340]  was jogging on the treadmill and it was all about the near future Muslims
[02:24:37.340 --> 02:24:41.740]  blowing up soft targets so the answer is they've said shopping malls streets
[02:24:41.740 --> 02:24:45.500]  checkpoints notice the government's like we're getting ready and then in every
[02:24:45.500 --> 02:24:49.700]  case it's linked to the government directly we're like never mind about
[02:24:49.700 --> 02:24:53.940]  that we're taking over right as the depression comes in right as the
[02:24:53.940 --> 02:24:58.260]  implosion comes in and here's the news we'll get Alan Watts take on it in
[02:24:58.260 --> 02:25:02.780]  real-time here that's how I knew they were gonna blow up the World Trade
[02:25:02.780 --> 02:25:06.260]  Center months before they were getting everybody ready and saying when the
[02:25:06.260 --> 02:25:10.260]  attack comes give your rights up it's like a Jim Jones Kool-aid drinking drill
[02:25:10.260 --> 02:25:13.900]  bomb squad at building their state house at for mailroom employee injured
[02:25:13.900 --> 02:25:19.620]  state FBI officials not servants officials called the scene second explosion
[02:25:19.620 --> 02:25:23.940]  reported at Hanover office so we got it in Baltimore and Annapolis correct guys
[02:25:23.940 --> 02:25:29.780]  the Maryland state house mailroom employee was injured Thursday afternoon
[02:25:29.780 --> 02:25:33.340]  while handling a package an incident was being investigated by bomb squad
[02:25:33.340 --> 02:25:36.820]  according to anapolis city officials anapolis fire department's bombs club
[02:25:36.820 --> 02:25:40.540]  was investigating the incident and the state's bomb squad and FBI officials
[02:25:40.540 --> 02:25:43.500]  were on their way to the Jeffrey building on st. Francis Street where the
[02:25:43.500 --> 02:25:48.900]  incident took place again this is just now breaking continuing a fire crews
[02:25:48.900 --> 02:25:54.260]  hazmat sent to MDOT this Maryland Department of Transportation Jeffrey
[02:25:54.260 --> 02:25:58.100]  building officials are investigating possible explosions at the Maryland
[02:25:58.100 --> 02:26:01.780]  Department of Transportation headquarters and Hanover and the state
[02:26:01.780 --> 02:26:06.700]  government building in Annapolis now the feds have tried six seven times the
[02:26:06.700 --> 02:26:14.740]  last few months to get Hispanic black white prison converts to Islam
[02:26:14.740 --> 02:26:19.620]  converted by feds to blow up Christmas trees and things and even the mainstream
[02:26:19.620 --> 02:26:22.780]  media has called it set ups entrapment but they're out there finding mentally
[02:26:22.780 --> 02:26:26.460]  ill morons in a matter of days I could find a homeless schizophrenic going to
[02:26:26.460 --> 02:26:29.620]  blow something up hypothetically if I wanted to me it's not hard give them
[02:26:29.620 --> 02:26:33.860]  whiskey and drugs and money that they'll do it it's the same old story but
[02:26:33.860 --> 02:26:36.660]  obviously that wasn't working enough so they may have gotten an actual lunar
[02:26:36.660 --> 02:26:41.220]  attack to do this or they may have done it themselves let's get Alan Watts take
[02:26:41.220 --> 02:26:45.460]  on all of this as it unfolds we do have man arrested Maryland terror bomb bomb
[02:26:45.460 --> 02:26:51.020]  plot and this was back in the 8th of December here's another one lawyer FBI
[02:26:51.020 --> 02:26:56.140]  entrap Baltimore bomb plot suspect no way Antonia Martinez could have assembled
[02:26:56.140 --> 02:26:59.220]  the phony bomb intended to blow up recruitment centers so we got a major
[02:26:59.220 --> 02:27:03.900]  operation already going in Maryland Alan what's your take on this situation
[02:27:03.900 --> 02:27:08.380]  you're quite right they can find whoever they want and in fact right after
[02:27:08.380 --> 02:27:14.260]  9-11 the BBC you had the top guy on from MI5 who was saying that they keep
[02:27:14.260 --> 02:27:19.140]  putting up sites and putting up their own agents there to entice youngsters into
[02:27:19.140 --> 02:27:24.220]  these sites to carry out bombs for stinging operations that they'll end up
[02:27:24.220 --> 02:27:28.740]  creating an actual organization al Qaeda which did not exist before yeah just like
[02:27:28.740 --> 02:27:31.980]  they can get kids to join the military and have their head shaved me brainwashed
[02:27:31.980 --> 02:27:36.700]  the government posing with recruiters can recruit people to radical Islam
[02:27:36.700 --> 02:27:41.740]  absolutely to and many of Muslim are actually stinging operations and they
[02:27:41.740 --> 02:27:45.780]  supply the fake bombs they get a bunch of youngsters there who watch too many
[02:27:45.780 --> 02:27:51.100]  video games and and they're in on the plot and they caught red-handed with the
[02:27:51.100 --> 02:27:55.940]  the goods and they're arrested so if you if you change the world into a war
[02:27:55.940 --> 02:27:59.940]  scenario and this is the whole thing since 9-11 I said at the time I said
[02:27:59.940 --> 02:28:03.100]  there you can see a rationing down the road all the things you've seen warfare
[02:28:03.100 --> 02:28:07.780]  even eventually refugees getting moved from one area to another that will
[02:28:07.780 --> 02:28:10.900]  happen because they must get an actual all the things that worked and that was
[02:28:10.900 --> 02:28:15.460]  in the UN report from from Mexico last month is that they are gonna force move
[02:28:15.460 --> 02:28:20.860]  people for the earth mm-hmm and that is all part of it a true war scenario
[02:28:20.860 --> 02:28:24.900]  because they know the psychological impacts of all these things how it has
[02:28:24.900 --> 02:28:28.700]  on the general populations they buckle under even more to do with their tolls
[02:28:28.700 --> 02:28:33.140]  during these scenarios they're terrified and that they ram whole bunches of new
[02:28:33.140 --> 02:28:37.420]  laws down their strokes at quite and that there's no objection from the people
[02:28:37.420 --> 02:28:41.180]  who are terrified that's what they must do now and of course that's what the
[02:28:41.180 --> 02:28:45.900]  whole ecological movement is to sustain abilities so on where it will global
[02:28:45.900 --> 02:28:49.900]  warming all this nonsense it's an excuse to bring all of this on into the
[02:28:49.900 --> 02:28:54.620]  controlled scientifically controlled society and remember Russell said that
[02:28:54.620 --> 02:28:58.340]  this will come this is the way they were working towards it back in the 30s
[02:28:58.340 --> 02:29:02.780]  40s in the 50s and he says this will come and he said when it comes in it
[02:29:02.780 --> 02:29:09.100]  will be a dictatorial and absolutely tyrannical system but that's what I
[02:29:09.100 --> 02:29:12.620]  prefer he said it would have to be utterly tyrannical as a scientific
[02:29:12.620 --> 02:29:16.340]  dictatorship so that's what we're going to see getting through I mean it's all
[02:29:16.340 --> 02:29:20.580]  through the schools that for the last 15 20 years the children have been taught
[02:29:20.580 --> 02:29:24.620]  to be greenies taught the government is good taught that must share the food
[02:29:24.620 --> 02:29:28.340]  with the whole world and in reality it's nothing to do with that the United
[02:29:28.340 --> 02:29:31.740]  Nations Department of Agriculture was set up with the task where it was
[02:29:31.740 --> 02:29:38.180]  created to be the organization that will distribute food to every region
[02:29:38.180 --> 02:29:42.780]  across the world as Henry Kissinger said stay there and they're showing
[02:29:42.780 --> 02:29:47.140]  cartoons the young kids that say this the UN decides what you get for dinner I
[02:29:47.140 --> 02:29:55.740]  mean it's really happening we're on the March the empires on the run Alex Jones

[02:31:03.420 --> 02:31:07.740]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[02:31:07.740 --> 02:31:12.100]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[02:31:12.100 --> 02:31:16.380]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[02:31:16.380 --> 02:31:20.740]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[02:31:20.740 --> 02:31:24.820]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[02:31:24.820 --> 02:31:29.380]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:31:29.380 --> 02:31:33.500]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[02:31:33.500 --> 02:31:37.460]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[02:31:37.460 --> 02:31:41.300]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[02:31:41.300 --> 02:31:44.020]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[02:32:00.460 --> 02:32:05.500]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[02:32:05.500 --> 02:32:10.060]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[02:32:10.060 --> 02:32:14.020]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've
[02:32:14.020 --> 02:32:18.500]  turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really
[02:32:18.500 --> 02:32:23.300]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[02:32:23.300 --> 02:32:27.660]  citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our
[02:32:27.660 --> 02:32:32.900]  nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[02:32:32.900 --> 02:32:37.220]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists
[02:32:37.220 --> 02:32:40.700]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[02:32:40.700 --> 02:32:45.940]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[02:32:45.940 --> 02:32:51.620]  have seen a fall of the republic yet your copy of fall of the republic on DVD

[02:33:26.500 --> 02:33:30.940]  happening I guess good luck or bad luck but he is here with us we've got a top
[02:33:30.940 --> 02:33:34.500]  meteorologist who's been accurately predicting the weather for a long time
[02:33:34.500 --> 02:33:38.300]  and finally getting the attention he deserves we're dealing with this ice age
[02:33:38.300 --> 02:33:44.500]  situation coming up into the fourth hour today I know we're on several radio
[02:33:44.500 --> 02:33:48.700]  stations in the great state of Maryland great people up there we hope that no
[02:33:48.700 --> 02:33:53.140]  one has been injured but they're reporting packages exploding and they're
[02:33:53.140 --> 02:33:58.060]  not sure of those injuries this is a developing situation bomb squad at
[02:33:58.060 --> 02:34:02.140]  state building near state house of her mailroom employees injured that's the
[02:34:02.140 --> 02:34:08.020]  Baltimore Sun saying there are injuries and other WB ALTV says they're not sure
[02:34:08.020 --> 02:34:13.020]  my crew will continue to give us this as it comes in a fire crews has Matt sent
[02:34:13.020 --> 02:34:18.580]  to the Maryland Department of Transportation where they were investigating
[02:34:18.580 --> 02:34:22.020]  reported explosions the Maryland Department of Transportation headquarters
[02:34:22.020 --> 02:34:26.980]  and with all the drills and things they do it just creates this hype and fear I
[02:34:26.980 --> 02:34:30.580]  mean I saw big accidents the other night look like they were fatalities and we
[02:34:30.580 --> 02:34:34.460]  all freak out and get scared of that we still drive our cars 300 plus thousand
[02:34:34.460 --> 02:34:39.300]  dead a year just in the US millions did every year overall but then a few deaths
[02:34:39.300 --> 02:34:43.700]  here and there from quote terrorists and our whole way of life ends and now they
[02:34:43.700 --> 02:34:49.980]  stick their hands down our pants with the TSA breaking our will we did search
[02:34:49.980 --> 02:34:53.460]  terms today and I haven't done this in about three weeks until yesterday and it
[02:34:53.460 --> 02:34:58.380]  did become the number one search term censorship Jesse Ventura we're doing
[02:34:58.380 --> 02:35:04.980]  prison cities today but I said I might fire another key search term torpedo
[02:35:04.980 --> 02:35:08.780]  because for those that don't know it causes hundreds of blogs newspapers to
[02:35:08.780 --> 02:35:13.340]  pick up on it and look at it with the history of stage terror and all the other
[02:35:13.340 --> 02:35:18.220]  mainstream news articles even saying stage terror in Maryland DC Oregon
[02:35:18.220 --> 02:35:24.340]  Washington state Colorado in previous months we need to launch a big torpedo
[02:35:24.340 --> 02:35:30.620]  here with the headline Maryland stage terror that's even more important than
[02:35:30.620 --> 02:35:37.460]  searching prison cities Maryland stage terror let's make it number one so all
[02:35:37.460 --> 02:35:42.700]  the people searching will see the blurb article Watson and Steve Watson both
[02:35:42.700 --> 02:35:46.900]  Watson's are doing Aaron Dice's here I want him on it and info wars.com we're
[02:35:46.900 --> 02:35:50.100]  going right back to our guest here in a moment to get his take on this salon
[02:35:50.100 --> 02:35:55.980]  magazine lawyer FBI in trap Baltimore bomb plot suspect this was December 13th
[02:35:55.980 --> 02:36:00.300]  just a month ago less than a month no way Antonio Martinez could have assembled
[02:36:00.300 --> 02:36:05.020]  the phony bomb intended to blow up the recruitment center defense says same
[02:36:05.020 --> 02:36:08.820]  thing came out the government isn't infiltrating groups they advertise they
[02:36:08.820 --> 02:36:16.500]  promote and it's always American idiots who convert and then get radicalized
[02:36:16.500 --> 02:36:21.340]  just like Texas Monthly in 98 gave a bomb steer award to the FBI for creating
[02:36:21.340 --> 02:36:25.500]  a clan group trying to get them to blow up a chemical plant for two years the
[02:36:25.500 --> 02:36:28.420]  FBI cooked the bomb trained the driver told me go ahead with the attack an
[02:36:28.420 --> 02:36:34.420]  insider blew the whistle 1993 World Trade Center first attack on we're all
[02:36:34.420 --> 02:36:39.580]  a locky top of al Qaeda below bin Laden secretly under Pentagon control Fox News
[02:36:39.580 --> 02:36:43.500]  running the underwear bombing the shoe bomber the the Fort Hood shooter the
[02:36:43.500 --> 02:36:49.500]  Times Square they go out and find out of a billion 100 million Muslims fruitcake
[02:36:49.500 --> 02:36:55.300]  crackpots I mean this is folks I can't tell you how many times I've had cops
[02:36:55.300 --> 02:36:59.100]  and plainclothes come to events I'm at and say let's blow stuff up Alex and I
[02:36:59.100 --> 02:37:04.100]  just start calling the police on them and they go I'm an officer run off I mean
[02:37:04.100 --> 02:37:09.660]  it's it's look that's what they do okay I want to go back to Alan Wadd on this
[02:37:09.660 --> 02:37:14.020]  but the search term Maryland stage terror and all the rest of you out there
[02:37:14.020 --> 02:37:18.060]  write your own articles on it we've got the history of this man arrested
[02:37:18.060 --> 02:37:24.020]  Maryland terror bomb plot so you know this Martinez person I tell you Alan
[02:37:24.020 --> 02:37:30.140]  Wadd this is so obvious what they're doing well you've got a few are setting
[02:37:30.140 --> 02:37:34.780]  up a world of totalitarianism and currently you've got to justify the
[02:37:34.780 --> 02:37:38.460]  reasons for it so if nothing's happening you make it happen and this is a
[02:37:38.460 --> 02:37:42.580]  very old technique of course they've even put in comedy shows like Brazil
[02:37:42.580 --> 02:37:46.220]  where bombs go off every so often restaurants that they never catch a
[02:37:46.220 --> 02:37:49.420]  terrorist but everyone believes the propaganda was the terrorist they're
[02:37:49.420 --> 02:37:54.180]  doing it so we need to all of these checkpoints and pat downs and and so on
[02:37:54.180 --> 02:37:58.540]  this is a simple technique and it works very well most of the public you know
[02:37:58.540 --> 02:38:03.580]  listen to nothing but mainstream news and that's what they believe they believe
[02:38:03.580 --> 02:38:08.140]  it's all for their own good and so on and they're cheap they've already lost
[02:38:08.140 --> 02:38:12.660]  their ability to stand up for anything most of them because the first attack
[02:38:12.660 --> 02:38:18.620]  was on men itself and the family unit and men traditionally and the British
[02:38:18.620 --> 02:38:22.020]  government did studies on this is even in two different countries to conquer
[02:38:22.020 --> 02:38:26.220]  them there was always a man who stood up for their culture their way of life
[02:38:26.220 --> 02:38:30.420]  their family their wife and so on you take all of that away from them you
[02:38:30.420 --> 02:38:35.580]  destroy the culture you take away the wife and and it's nothing to stand up
[02:38:35.580 --> 02:38:39.860]  for in fact it becomes rather like a lazy dog who just sits and watches all the
[02:38:39.860 --> 02:38:43.260]  porno movies are coming out goes to parties and picks up the odd female
[02:38:43.260 --> 02:38:47.980]  who's awfully available and these days and that's what you have and it's all
[02:38:47.980 --> 02:38:52.460]  empty it's all empty there isn't that tribal fulfillment of taking care of
[02:38:52.460 --> 02:38:57.060]  your family and the men and women being on a team it's a bunch of unhappy people
[02:38:57.060 --> 02:39:02.180]  mad that life is hell so they break up because they haven't submitted to each
[02:39:02.180 --> 02:39:06.460]  other that's correct it is commitment you see for everything that you do even
[02:39:06.460 --> 02:39:10.220]  to fight this takes commitment and you can you must only start with yourself
[02:39:10.220 --> 02:39:13.780]  and we've all been contaminated with this system and that's what it's called
[02:39:13.780 --> 02:39:19.060]  your indoctrination and your lifestyle is called contamination and the Soviets
[02:39:19.060 --> 02:39:22.460]  called it that too since they helped introduce a lot of it and we've got
[02:39:22.460 --> 02:39:26.300]  their manuals where they describe everything that's been done here yes
[02:39:26.300 --> 02:39:30.820]  and you have to decontaminate yourself starting with yourself and it doesn't
[02:39:30.820 --> 02:39:33.940]  matter what the rest go to go and do and they want you to go along with them
[02:39:33.940 --> 02:39:37.660]  you say no I'm not doing that and if they ask you why you tell them that
[02:39:37.660 --> 02:39:40.980]  things are going to get awfully bad unless we discipline ourselves we're
[02:39:40.980 --> 02:39:45.780]  doomed and what are the FBI training manuals say the white male who's nice
[02:39:45.780 --> 02:39:51.020]  and friendly who's professional who exercises a lot who wants to be involved
[02:39:51.020 --> 02:39:55.820]  in the community that's a Texas Homeland Security manual that's the enemy that
[02:39:55.820 --> 02:40:01.980]  clean-cut pure person is an enemy you see that what's been left for the rest of
[02:40:01.980 --> 02:40:05.740]  the public with the dysfunctional relationships and casual relationships
[02:40:05.740 --> 02:40:11.780]  is that they have no purpose and to fill up a gap for no purpose they've got
[02:40:11.780 --> 02:40:16.700]  so much cheap entertainment just thrown at them and not cash their pockets to go
[02:40:16.700 --> 02:40:21.460]  party at weekends and that's what they think living is all about now they have
[02:40:21.460 --> 02:40:26.660]  no bonding to any community or any family and exactly whether you're
[02:40:26.660 --> 02:40:31.180]  African or Japanese or an American if you're a pure woman or a pure man are
[02:40:31.180 --> 02:40:35.300]  trying to be pure they know you're gonna see all of this and so that's why
[02:40:35.300 --> 02:40:40.140]  you're the enemy yeah and so therefore as I say you got to start with yourself
[02:40:40.140 --> 02:40:44.100]  and change yourself and decontaminate yourself even the things that you might
[02:40:44.100 --> 02:40:48.740]  be addicted to that I've had young people right to me who know what's going on and
[02:40:48.740 --> 02:40:53.220]  they'll tell me that they still like certain parts of it like the partying
[02:40:53.220 --> 02:40:57.980]  they like the multi-casual affairs that they have sexual affairs and it'll
[02:40:57.980 --> 02:41:00.860]  realize that that's all part of the destructiveness you can't have it both
[02:41:00.860 --> 02:41:05.660]  ways because when you look at all from the primitive tribes to to the to our
[02:41:05.660 --> 02:41:10.460]  own tribes that lived up into the 1800s they all lived in the same structure
[02:41:10.460 --> 02:41:16.460]  same family structure and you can't go around just really nearly with promiscuity
[02:41:16.460 --> 02:41:20.180]  and all the rest of it that destroys everything and that's why it was the
[02:41:20.180 --> 02:41:25.660]  main weapon to be promoted during the 60s 70s and 80s to the present time you
[02:41:25.660 --> 02:41:29.260]  can't have it both ways you've got to change yourself in order to change the
[02:41:29.260 --> 02:41:35.660]  world and they train the so-called middle class to be in love with their
[02:41:35.660 --> 02:41:39.740]  servitude as Bertrand Russell said they would when you try to warn them they
[02:41:39.740 --> 02:41:43.540]  have a defense mechanism to get a little creamy-eyed look you know in their
[02:41:43.540 --> 02:41:48.180]  eyes and giggle at you and then they'll even accept it and say yeah I like it
[02:41:48.180 --> 02:41:53.260]  they think by doing that crime-stop mind trick it gives them power over it and
[02:41:53.260 --> 02:41:58.620]  the average male out there is on arrested development six-year-old yeah
[02:41:58.620 --> 02:42:03.780]  they're definitely and even politicians in the US I read that article
[02:42:03.780 --> 02:42:07.780]  pretty recently too where one of your congressmen said that we must train the
[02:42:07.780 --> 02:42:11.900]  public by using the language of the media which is meant for the fifth grade
[02:42:11.900 --> 02:42:16.900]  that's what they're using on the public and have been for a long time but you're
[02:42:16.900 --> 02:42:22.340]  quite right to a lot of us aimed at the male as I say today it's a shopping mall
[02:42:22.340 --> 02:42:26.860]  for sex that's what all it is like and notice they don't let males act like
[02:42:26.860 --> 02:42:31.540]  warrior males in any context and they put chemicals in the water to to reduce
[02:42:31.540 --> 02:42:36.620]  testosterone but then in one area if you want to be a cop or a soldier then
[02:42:36.620 --> 02:42:41.220]  you're allowed to act that out but against your own people that's absolutely
[02:42:41.220 --> 02:42:44.420]  true in other words winners and losers and youngsters who grew up with video
[02:42:44.420 --> 02:42:49.100]  games too and dysfunctional families are no family at all look I saw that they
[02:42:49.100 --> 02:42:52.260]  see things in black and white winners and losers and they want to be on the
[02:42:52.260 --> 02:42:56.020]  winning team some have told me that by the way and they want to get into the
[02:42:56.020 --> 02:42:59.580]  black outfits and have the big machine gun and order people about because they
[02:42:59.580 --> 02:43:05.860]  know they're gonna get more privileges than those who are under the gun yeah and
[02:43:05.860 --> 02:43:10.580]  they've gone from denying that police are being put on steroids to major city
[02:43:10.580 --> 02:43:14.820]  police chiefs even here in Texas basically ordering everyone to inject
[02:43:14.820 --> 02:43:19.220]  testosterone yeah that's correct and they've been doing this really for years
[02:43:19.220 --> 02:43:24.580]  and we've long beforehand and they put on the beef of course and and you tell
[02:43:24.580 --> 02:43:30.540]  to it's more than just an effect effect on on your muscle etc they they
[02:43:30.540 --> 02:43:33.860]  become sluggish in their brain they become more primitive and it's no doubt
[02:43:33.860 --> 02:43:37.220]  about that either they become monsters in fact they love to beat people up and
[02:43:37.220 --> 02:43:43.380]  and go to excess so and mind you too for years they've been recruiting the lower
[02:43:43.380 --> 02:43:47.580]  IQ types for the police force and I've been listening to Howard Stern lately
[02:43:47.580 --> 02:43:53.380]  just randomly in my car on XM and every time I tune in he's glorifying police
[02:43:53.380 --> 02:43:58.220]  beating innocent people and how good it is and then I hear it on other shows
[02:43:58.220 --> 02:44:02.580]  that are for the lowest common denominator they're teaching us that
[02:44:02.580 --> 02:44:09.260]  that that all of this evil is beautiful mm-hmm yeah and once again the public
[02:44:09.260 --> 02:44:14.340]  have been did so desensitized to horror what should be to should offend them as
[02:44:14.340 --> 02:44:18.980]  being horrific it's not it actually get off on it just like a movie they can't
[02:44:18.980 --> 02:44:22.700]  tell the difference between fiction and in fact it's better alive that's what
[02:44:22.700 --> 02:44:25.420]  there's some of them yeah they're blurring the two and it's also real
[02:44:25.420 --> 02:44:31.060]  popular on the internet for girls to abuse cats and dogs and and and and
[02:44:31.060 --> 02:44:35.500]  ferrets and they get off on it but then the minute the minute they're being
[02:44:35.500 --> 02:44:40.820]  abused they can't believe it and cry cry for mommy yes or said the governor
[02:44:40.820 --> 02:44:43.940]  should be a law about that and that's exactly what government wants they
[02:44:43.940 --> 02:44:47.620]  love they love to put more laws on you but yeah they promote that we don't
[02:44:47.620 --> 02:44:52.340]  govern ourselves so they will govern us yeah absolutely and it's true if you
[02:44:52.340 --> 02:44:56.140]  don't govern yourself then someone else is going to do it for you and it's the
[02:44:56.140 --> 02:45:00.420]  same with your mind if you don't take care because you're the gatekeeper of
[02:45:00.420 --> 02:45:04.260]  what comes into your mind and affects you then somebody else will end up being
[02:45:04.260 --> 02:45:10.420]  doing that for no for a long time and now they have the kinetic game that's
[02:45:10.420 --> 02:45:14.340]  come out and I heard the neighborhood kid telling my son about it yesterday
[02:45:14.340 --> 02:45:19.220]  about how great it is that it face scans even knows his voice and follows all
[02:45:19.220 --> 02:45:23.940]  his movements and Microsoft admits that it's listening to your whole house
[02:45:23.940 --> 02:45:27.420]  with it it's hooked into the internet and now they're racing with Jesse Ventura
[02:45:27.420 --> 02:45:34.260]  TV show off of the Teavos and you versus we've confirmed that why would they let
[02:45:34.260 --> 02:45:38.860]  Ventura show come out and then decide to start pulling episodes and banning the
[02:45:38.860 --> 02:45:43.020]  re-airing of certain episodes well I know the inside scoop they allowed it
[02:45:43.020 --> 02:45:46.500]  thinking that that that would just be a conditioning mechanism for some reason
[02:45:46.500 --> 02:45:51.140]  they decided it was having too big of a trigger and they banned the police state
[02:45:51.140 --> 02:45:54.220]  episode what do you think's going on behind that it's probably quite right
[02:45:54.220 --> 02:46:00.700]  so probably was meant to be a predictor programming over owing show and what was
[02:46:00.700 --> 02:46:05.340]  it well gee what can you do about it it's gonna come but the more folk talk
[02:46:05.340 --> 02:46:10.620]  about what you see and and find ways to to to propagate the information to each
[02:46:10.620 --> 02:46:15.700]  other and find ways around it to combat it or they get a big backlash about it
[02:46:15.700 --> 02:46:19.740]  then they find it said that the opposite effect than what they intended but that
[02:46:19.740 --> 02:46:24.020]  shows an enemy miscalculation and again not that Ventura is bad or I was bad
[02:46:24.020 --> 02:46:29.660]  I mean we really put real shows on air and it was funny though the network would
[02:46:29.660 --> 02:46:36.980]  come in to say the episode on bio weapons labs bio shield and was a really
[02:46:36.980 --> 02:46:42.580]  serious episode but the network execs above even true TV said put a mon-talk
[02:46:42.580 --> 02:46:47.180]  monster in there put a put a dead animal that washed up to try to discredit it
[02:46:47.180 --> 02:46:51.340]  yeah but but but they were unable to get to get it all done so now they're just
[02:46:51.340 --> 02:46:57.220]  like no stop no don't don't air it no no yeah and I've had the same offers too to
[02:46:57.220 --> 02:47:01.380]  go on to some really big shows I turned them all down because they want me to
[02:47:01.380 --> 02:47:05.820]  bring in the aliens and there's not any other and what that does is you got you
[02:47:05.820 --> 02:47:09.460]  then act for counterintelligence counterintelligence takes the factual
[02:47:09.460 --> 02:47:14.780]  data they mix it with the farcical and and then people part that and some like
[02:47:14.780 --> 02:47:19.340]  lunatics yeah same here I've turned down just the last year multiple big
[02:47:19.340 --> 02:47:23.420]  national shows I would host I mean you know we're ready to go but they said
[02:47:23.420 --> 02:47:29.940]  listen the execs want you to do aliens mixed with it and I'm like and let me
[02:47:29.940 --> 02:47:34.700]  guess tube of cobbers as well I'm like no and and and people can't believe when
[02:47:34.700 --> 02:47:39.780]  you say no to them yeah I know and it regards to the cash out that they
[02:47:39.780 --> 02:47:43.500]  offered the whole thing I just turned them all all down because every single
[02:47:43.500 --> 02:47:48.860]  biggie out there has asked me do the same thing well plus once you've done that
[02:47:48.860 --> 02:47:53.100]  they have weird rules unwritten rules once you've taken one of their deals
[02:47:53.100 --> 02:47:58.460]  even though it's unwritten and unspoken then if I did that to use it to get
[02:47:58.460 --> 02:48:03.420]  even bigger to then flip and expose them after then they would kill me but
[02:48:03.420 --> 02:48:08.620]  because I've always stayed pure it's like a weird unwritten rule I know you've
[02:48:08.620 --> 02:48:15.980]  studied that what is what's behind that it's probably compromise as well they
[02:48:15.980 --> 02:48:20.700]  throw instead of legalities and rules as a brotherhood you come into the
[02:48:20.700 --> 02:48:24.620]  confidence and you're agreeing to something you suspect it and they'll
[02:48:24.620 --> 02:48:27.900]  make sure that they give enough information you suspect they want to
[02:48:27.900 --> 02:48:32.580]  use you for something and that's a real like legal deal and that their self
[02:48:32.580 --> 02:48:37.580]  brotherhood terminology and the way of thinking and they don't let it go they
[02:48:37.580 --> 02:48:43.300]  will never let it go if you've a quest to go along with something like that
[02:48:43.300 --> 02:48:49.180]  unbelievable why do the globalist enjoy throughout history the the the
[02:48:49.180 --> 02:48:54.780]  initiated ones that the the Illuminati priest class why do they love destroying
[02:48:54.780 --> 02:48:59.500]  their own even servants that serve them perfectly and this is just part of a
[02:48:59.500 --> 02:49:04.700]  process of killing anybody who knows where the bodies are buried it's partly
[02:49:04.700 --> 02:49:09.700]  that too it's partly that they're remember they are an ultra elite and they
[02:49:09.700 --> 02:49:14.300]  have a completely different upbringing a completely different education than
[02:49:14.300 --> 02:49:20.940]  those that go to even Harvard and I can remember or will put part of the the
[02:49:20.940 --> 02:49:27.380]  initiation of the so-called Illuminati or the rebel force in his book like any
[02:49:27.380 --> 02:49:31.100]  before and part of it was that you had to swear that if it was necessary to
[02:49:31.100 --> 02:49:35.260]  sacrifice you for the cause they would sacrifice you and you had to accept that
[02:49:35.260 --> 02:49:39.180]  that one day they might just sacrifice you throw you to the wolves and that they
[02:49:39.180 --> 02:49:43.220]  have no problem doing that and you must remember too that Julian Huxley who was
[02:49:43.220 --> 02:49:47.340]  umptime umpteenth generation in bread for his purpose because they were
[02:49:47.340 --> 02:49:52.100]  already built especially beating now he was the head of the UNESCO dehumanization
[02:49:52.100 --> 02:49:56.460]  program yeah he admitted that he was there were there were offspring of
[02:49:56.460 --> 02:50:00.900]  scientific elite and he was one of them that was his family's role and yeah most
[02:50:00.900 --> 02:50:05.540]  the children died but he and his brother were the only genetic expression yeah and
[02:50:05.540 --> 02:50:10.380]  he did say that so lots will will think that fit to come through into this new
[02:50:10.380 --> 02:50:14.660]  world order as a servant class who served them very well but they're in for a
[02:50:14.660 --> 02:50:18.860]  big surprise they will eliminate them too they will no longer need them and
[02:50:18.860 --> 02:50:22.820]  apart from that they'll know too much they'll know too much and we don't get
[02:50:22.820 --> 02:50:25.780]  the proper rewards that they thought they would get like they will not be
[02:50:25.780 --> 02:50:31.940]  living in these especially rural gated high-class communities they'd be
[02:50:31.940 --> 02:50:35.660]  bitching they'd open their mouths they'd let the cat out the bag and they'd be a
[02:50:35.660 --> 02:50:39.820]  problem it has to be eliminated and I hope they're listening because the new
[02:50:39.820 --> 02:50:43.460]  world order can't wait to torture you to death so all of you out there thinking
[02:50:43.460 --> 02:50:48.260]  you're on the winning team you lose the only way we beat this is by defeating it

[02:55:22.660 --> 02:55:25.980]  they're not invincible they don't have all the answers and I think one of the
[02:55:25.980 --> 02:55:31.220]  biggest keys as you just alluded to is reaching out to the super class that
[02:55:31.220 --> 02:55:36.380]  Rothkopf called it six thousand super gophers and really and I've talked to
[02:55:36.380 --> 02:55:40.180]  some billionaires I've talked to people medical doctors that have treated heads
[02:55:40.180 --> 02:55:44.780]  of state they will even confide in them that they're depressed about this but
[02:55:44.780 --> 02:55:49.540]  kind of through fear going along just because they're raised into this a lot
[02:55:49.540 --> 02:55:56.300]  of them don't like it and I think reaching out to them to you know resist
[02:55:56.300 --> 02:56:01.860]  and to speak out I think that's a really important thing to do as we near this
[02:56:01.860 --> 02:56:07.660]  mass extermination program what's your view on that it's difficult to get
[02:56:07.660 --> 02:56:12.460]  through them understand the concept but they for the lifetime of this indoctrination
[02:56:12.460 --> 02:56:17.660]  and they still claim they're still clean to the to the hope that they'll be the
[02:56:17.660 --> 02:56:22.900]  ones living in the in the more expensive gated communities well armed well
[02:56:22.900 --> 02:56:27.300]  defended well fed with extra privilege to this world is to be a world of
[02:56:27.300 --> 02:56:32.260]  privileges understand and every tear gets extra privileges even the cops get
[02:56:32.260 --> 02:56:35.940]  extra privilege that's what Nick Rockefeller it's an artificial state
[02:56:35.940 --> 02:56:39.940]  run class system Nick Rockefeller told Aaron Russo that they a leader all gonna
[02:56:39.940 --> 02:56:46.700]  have chips that say kiss my hand in and and as I say to they'll have to and they
[02:56:46.700 --> 02:56:50.500]  do they have to work till they drop the elite as well they don't retire as you
[02:56:50.500 --> 02:56:55.700]  well know they've sworn on for life and they don't get a break they must go
[02:56:55.700 --> 02:56:59.180]  along and along and along with everything and never give a slip of the tongue
[02:56:59.180 --> 02:57:04.020]  it's hard for me to do that if that parties etc because that means an
[02:57:04.020 --> 02:57:07.900]  instant death sentence or a cut off from the food supply or you get bombed in
[02:57:07.900 --> 02:57:12.540]  with the peasants but there'll be the city themselves as you well know are
[02:57:12.540 --> 02:57:17.060]  getting set up to be the prison camps as they take us down they haven't upgraded
[02:57:17.060 --> 02:57:21.220]  these cities they don't intend to upgrade them that they've let them that the
[02:57:21.220 --> 02:57:25.860]  roads rot for last 30 odd years in preparation for this and it's a rapid
[02:57:25.860 --> 02:57:30.460]  depopulation they hope to depopulate rapidly over the next 50 years and
[02:57:30.460 --> 02:57:34.140]  Rockefeller said that at the last meeting offer they call the lucky gene
[02:57:34.140 --> 02:57:38.340]  club for opera and gates and all these guys go you said we've been very
[02:57:38.340 --> 02:57:42.740]  successful with sterilization and so on across the world but now it must go
[02:57:42.740 --> 02:57:47.740]  into rapid depopulation that means getting everyone off the land into these
[02:57:47.740 --> 02:57:53.460]  cities they're falling apart and there'll be other ones put up special
[02:57:53.460 --> 02:57:57.100]  ones for that for the managerial class to have their extra privileges their
[02:57:57.100 --> 02:58:01.860]  better lifestyle for a while and that's has really been set up at the moment
[02:58:01.860 --> 02:58:06.580]  they're even building on the 15 acres they stole from landowners 14 years ago
[02:58:06.580 --> 02:58:11.420]  in Austin elite areas actually owned by the former city council people that took
[02:58:11.420 --> 02:58:16.060]  it they're now the bankers and the state senators and it's openly neighborhoods
[02:58:16.060 --> 02:58:20.500]  with the criminals living in the luxury homes that's right that's how it's always
[02:58:20.500 --> 02:58:25.900]  been intended just like a brave new world predicted you know they are so
[02:58:25.900 --> 02:58:33.380]  diabolical they are so fully sick man I tell you mm-hmm mm-hmm back in 60

[03:00:22.900 --> 03:00:26.300]  so it's happening with the weather I'm finishing up with Alan Watt of cutting
[03:00:26.300 --> 03:00:33.540]  the matrix.com again I'm Alex Jones of info wars.com Alan again I study the
[03:00:33.540 --> 03:00:38.140]  globalist and they've got these overall managed systems but they want managed
[03:00:38.140 --> 03:00:41.140]  systems that are totally surveilled because if it isn't inside that surveilled
[03:00:41.140 --> 03:00:45.380]  system they can't control all the outcomes and I do see them making a lot
[03:00:45.380 --> 03:00:50.140]  of mistakes but because they do have the finance the capital on their side they've
[03:00:50.140 --> 03:00:55.020]  got you know a lot of momentum but I'm getting really positive and a lot of the
[03:00:55.020 --> 03:01:03.580]  political minds that I admire really agree that the globalist are not
[03:01:03.580 --> 03:01:08.060]  invincible and are not all powerful and that things are not going perfectly for
[03:01:08.060 --> 03:01:13.820]  them but I know that your view varies a bit on that give us your view well you
[03:01:13.820 --> 03:01:18.660]  see that they're quite right I've had article recently where some of the top
[03:01:18.660 --> 03:01:22.620]  politicians said that everything that they do and for everything that they
[03:01:22.620 --> 03:01:28.980]  put forward and plans and rules and laws the public must accept them and acquiesce
[03:01:28.980 --> 03:01:35.820]  they need our approval our tacit approval and silence it really connotes your
[03:01:35.820 --> 03:01:42.180]  approval and without that they can't do anything to be honest with you if enough
[03:01:42.180 --> 03:01:46.180]  people simply said and they could but the problem is getting them to do it now
[03:01:46.180 --> 03:01:49.220]  we're not going along with this we're not going along with this or that or
[03:01:49.220 --> 03:01:54.380]  whatever or boycott in all your airports the idea that could so easily be done but
[03:01:54.380 --> 03:01:58.020]  you cannot get the public to come together in this day and age they're so
[03:01:58.020 --> 03:02:02.820]  divided that's your problem it could be done but for every totalitarian measure
[03:02:02.820 --> 03:02:07.620]  it comes out you can simply say no that said it will take martyrs it was there's
[03:02:07.620 --> 03:02:13.460]  never been a change in history to get out of under the boots of tyranny that
[03:02:13.460 --> 03:02:17.300]  did not take martyrs going to prison for saying no we're not going to
[03:02:17.300 --> 03:02:22.060]  along with that you're not going to do this in some nice had unique way believe
[03:02:22.060 --> 03:02:25.980]  you me it's not going to happen and it's not going to happen by pleading with
[03:02:25.980 --> 03:02:29.820]  them either because no that these guys have got too much to look forward to
[03:02:29.820 --> 03:02:33.460]  they've been in the planning for hundreds of years they don't plan to change it
[03:02:33.460 --> 03:02:38.500]  and turn and round and be nice to us these are monsters at the top who
[03:02:38.500 --> 03:02:43.580]  literally see like HG Wells he knew darn well about the the killing of
[03:02:43.580 --> 03:02:48.740]  millions in Russia and the Ukraine but the Soviets and he thought it was a good
[03:02:48.740 --> 03:02:52.860]  thing he saw the same thing coming across the Western world towards the end
[03:02:52.860 --> 03:02:56.380]  of the millennium into the new it says would it have to kill off millions and
[03:02:56.380 --> 03:03:00.140]  millions of young people as well because they're all fertile basically and
[03:03:00.140 --> 03:03:05.100]  that would simply have to be done very matter of factly these these guys are
[03:03:05.100 --> 03:03:10.460]  monsters and but at the same time for every law and the minor laws too that
[03:03:10.460 --> 03:03:14.940]  they put out to tax you and carbon taxes and all the rest of it you must say
[03:03:14.940 --> 03:03:20.260]  okay okay and when you sign that tax form you're acquiescing to them and that's
[03:03:20.260 --> 03:03:25.060]  that's pretty well all you have left at the moment is to is to change yourself
[03:03:25.060 --> 03:03:29.700]  and say no okay I'll suffer and take the consequences and but enough people
[03:03:29.700 --> 03:03:34.580]  locked up as martyrs that's how Ireland helped to free itself too but all the
[03:03:34.580 --> 03:03:39.500]  thousands of people getting slammed in these prisons during the Troubles and
[03:03:39.500 --> 03:03:44.740]  noticed though Alan that how they tried to pass the EU the first time and they
[03:03:44.740 --> 03:03:50.540]  pass it the second time Ireland was this panacea of great you know wealth and
[03:03:50.540 --> 03:03:54.860]  then overnight oh your bank were up now foreign bankers are taking you over and
[03:03:54.860 --> 03:03:59.380]  the head of their central bank admitted he said foreigners now rule us I think
[03:03:59.380 --> 03:04:06.220]  that's good I mean so in your face well the Russian mafia moved down on block a
[03:04:06.220 --> 03:04:10.100]  lot of them do a lot too early in the restaurant off to places in Europe but
[03:04:10.100 --> 03:04:13.020]  but Ireland was a big place because they were getting lots of grants from the EU
[03:04:13.020 --> 03:04:17.380]  and of course the the mafia was in there like a shot and when the math Russian
[03:04:17.380 --> 03:04:22.300]  mafia accumulated all the dirty deeds and fake bonds no rest of it they run off
[03:04:22.300 --> 03:04:25.900]  with the loot and help bankrupt the country that was all set up in advance
[03:04:25.900 --> 03:04:30.460]  because the Russian mafia works with the globalist you see absolutely well
[03:04:30.460 --> 03:04:33.740]  Alan we're out of time I appreciate you joining us look forward to speaking to
[03:04:33.740 --> 03:04:37.380]  you again with the great work you're doing at an upcoming eugenics film we've

[03:09:04.380 --> 03:09:07.580]  next segment with him on a play a short clip from Fox and I've got other
[03:09:07.580 --> 03:09:13.260]  British news saying you know same thing we had this guy on a year ago and the
[03:09:13.260 --> 03:09:16.660]  mainstream meteorologist and media were predicting basically hardly any winner
[03:09:16.660 --> 03:09:23.340]  the end of snow and he went in on our show and he's a meteorologist and
[03:09:23.340 --> 03:09:28.220]  astrophysicist and I've looked at his record I mean he's you know paid by
[03:09:28.220 --> 03:09:32.900]  different farmer almanacs you name it to really give farmers the real research
[03:09:32.900 --> 03:09:37.900]  what the old-timers knew they didn't they didn't understand it they just knew
[03:09:37.900 --> 03:09:43.860]  the moon had a big effect on the weather as basically a lensing or amplifying
[03:09:43.860 --> 03:09:48.300]  effect with the solar winds that sends in so many particles into the atmosphere
[03:09:48.300 --> 03:09:51.860]  then there's the other big contributor which is the magnetic field of the earth
[03:09:51.860 --> 03:09:56.060]  but it's also affected by the solar winds mainline meteorologists supposedly
[03:09:56.060 --> 03:10:00.380]  ignore all this and use these ridiculous computer models that the
[03:10:00.380 --> 03:10:05.740]  science has found is about as accurate as a Ouija board or a Wheel of Fortune but
[03:10:05.740 --> 03:10:12.420]  Pierce Corbin year after year after year and it's all chronicled at weatheraction.com
[03:10:12.420 --> 03:10:18.020]  is accurate a lot more accurate in the mainstream and he predicted the coldest
[03:10:18.020 --> 03:10:23.820]  winter in a long time massive snowfall when it would hit what would happen and
[03:10:23.820 --> 03:10:28.820]  ladies and gentlemen he did this almost a year out I mean this is incredible and
[03:10:28.820 --> 03:10:34.780]  he does it over and over again following the old-timer systems which they
[03:10:34.780 --> 03:10:38.780]  didn't know why it was they just knew the moon had to do with it and he joins
[03:10:38.780 --> 03:10:42.900]  us Pierce Corbin to talk about what's happening now and what he sees happening
[03:10:42.900 --> 03:10:46.740]  coming up throughout the summer and next year or is that too early to tell
[03:10:46.740 --> 03:10:54.100]  Pierce Corbin a congratulations again on stunning accuracy. Well you got the
[03:10:54.100 --> 03:10:57.500]  floor we've only got you for 20 minutes tell us what's currently happening how
[03:10:57.500 --> 03:11:01.980]  you predicted it how it works and what's coming up next. Well last May we
[03:11:01.980 --> 03:11:08.940]  said at a conference an energy conference that December in Britain would be cold
[03:11:08.940 --> 03:11:16.540]  and snowy we didn't give any any more detail on that but then in November we
[03:11:16.540 --> 03:11:21.260]  put out a detailed forecast saying that to expected it would be the coldest
[03:11:21.260 --> 03:11:30.960]  December for 800 years and nobody believed us that is in fact exactly what
[03:11:30.960 --> 03:11:36.380]  happened in fact it's the central Indian temperatures are the second coldest in
[03:11:36.380 --> 03:11:41.940]  the full record of 352 years. I'm gonna have to interrupt you Pierce I'm sorry
[03:11:41.940 --> 03:11:46.420]  you were here in May of last year and and I can people can go to my YouTube
[03:11:46.420 --> 03:11:50.860]  channel or Prism Planet TV and watch it you said on the east coast of the US
[03:11:50.860 --> 03:11:56.860]  incredible snowfall freezing Canada snow in you predicted a super cold winter I
[03:11:56.860 --> 03:12:23.700]  mean you're you're really really playing down what you did. Well that's true. I was also going to add that we predicted one very specific blizzard which hit New York just after Christmas and we put out a detailed forecast about two weeks ahead although we'd had obviously ideas longer ahead but what is the truth I mean the some news is saying the colds in a
[03:12:23.700 --> 03:12:27.860]  thousand years but we don't have good records of that others are saying in 300 I mean what's
[03:12:27.860 --> 03:12:32.220]  your evidence show I mean is this does this mark sliding into a new ice age as
[03:12:32.220 --> 03:12:48.900]  many astrophysicists and meteorologists believe? Yes of course it's standard meteorology we'll just say everything's gonna go back to the norm. Now we say well in Europe and they're handy in many parts of America for sure it's gonna be carry on extremely cold in in
[03:12:48.900 --> 03:13:16.260]  January and February. Our longer range view is that we are heading towards a mini ice age and we'll we'll be well into that it'll be at its coldest in about 25 years time. We're gonna see more of these cold or very cold winters with extra extraordinary blizzards in them and more lousy summers both in
[03:13:16.260 --> 03:13:38.260]  Britain and Europe and in the USA. Okay again you're the true expert on this how is your perspective on approaching the science so much different than mainline meteorology I mean I know you've broken that down before but explain that to people and then let's continue discussing what's happening this year and what you see coming next year.
[03:13:38.260 --> 03:14:04.260]  Okay standard meteorology looks at the weather now sees how everything's moving and then says well if that's moving towards this something will happen and then it will do this and that and they can predict forwards. However after about four days it breaks down and it becomes very inaccurate. The reason for that is there's external influences driven from the sun and the moon interrupting the flow of charged particles from the sun.
[03:14:04.260 --> 03:14:28.260]  This solar lunar influence dictates the changes in the jet stream which are the change in weather patterns and what we've had in the last six months especially and it's going to carry on this year is significant jet stream blockings whereby the jet stream is kept in more or less the same place for a while.
[03:14:28.260 --> 03:14:39.260]  And that has caused the super heat wave in Russia for example which we predicted and we predicted when it would end cause the floods in Pakistan and simply.
[03:14:39.260 --> 03:14:50.260]  I know you predicted everything you're a regular. No I mean I remember you in May of last year laying so much of this out I mean it's incredible.
[03:14:50.260 --> 03:15:03.260]  Well yeah we are very pleased we want to be able to predict everything as it is 85% of what we say will happen does happen but there's a lot of things we haven't yet got a handle on.
[03:15:03.260 --> 03:15:20.260]  But some very interesting things going on right now where it's now obvious that the Queensland floods if you look at them the most likely floods all have all happened the biggest floods and the same phase of the eclipse cycle.
[03:15:20.260 --> 03:15:37.260]  Namely there was an eclipse at the sun on January the 4th which was near to the peak of this current wave of floods and the previous previous waves of floods of various very significant ones were in 1954,
[03:15:37.260 --> 03:15:52.260]  1953, 1992 or thereabouts which are all separated by 19 years which is the eclipse cycle so there was also solar eclipses and around the 4th of January those times as well.
[03:15:52.260 --> 03:15:54.260]  So just like a wind tunnel.
[03:15:54.260 --> 03:16:10.260]  Solar effect is why you got the floods. I bet I mean for laymen out there like a wind tunnel I mean so when the moon is basically directly lined up with the solar winds blocking them what does that generally result in?
[03:16:10.260 --> 03:16:32.260]  It's more complicated than that. Where the moon is obviously given the date of an eclipse also means a certain patterns before and after that and through the whole of its orbit the moon is influencing the solar wind which then influences the jet stream.
[03:16:32.260 --> 03:16:50.260]  What it seems is in certain phases of the eclipse cycle the moon's motion is favouring jamming and sticking off the jet stream and when you look at the rain map in Australia now the standard meteorologist is pointing.
[03:16:50.260 --> 03:17:06.260]  If you look at all this rain they say look it's coming here and here and it's staying there. It's always in this place. I mean it's a stuck jet stream. Now they scratch their heads and don't know why but we know why. We don't know the detailed mechanisms but we do know why and when it's going to happen.
[03:17:06.260 --> 03:17:12.260]  Why? What's triggering it then? I mean we understand the moon in relation to the sun and the solar wind.
[03:17:12.260 --> 03:17:30.260]  The jet stream would be moving normally all the time but somehow the moon interrupts the solar wind so that the motion of the jet stream becomes stuck.
[03:17:30.260 --> 03:17:42.260]  Now we don't understand the details of how it works but we can say when that type of thing is going to happen and when the jamming of the jet stream will break down.
[03:17:42.260 --> 03:18:02.260]  Well meteorologist and astrophysicist consultant owner weatheraction.com who makes weather forecast up to a year in advance with 85% accuracy. No one else can even get close to that. How can I just as an average Joe, not a rocket scientist know that the tides are caused by the moon?
[03:18:02.260 --> 03:18:16.260]  So why wouldn't the moon, if it can do that, affect the weather when we know the ocean is one of the biggest terrestrial drivers of the weather? How can mainline meteorology ignore that? I mean that's moronic, is it not?
[03:18:16.260 --> 03:18:40.260]  Well it is moronic yes but you see they can't cope with what to do and they don't know how to put it in. I mean they could be a lot more intelligent and make applications but you see if they were to follow what we say, maybe that the main drivers of all these things are external is the sun and the moon
[03:18:40.260 --> 03:18:57.260]  then they're going to have to ditch their man made climate change theory and that is the core of their belief system. So the Met Office in Britain now has even got to the stage where they put on the website it was going to be a mild winter.
[03:18:57.260 --> 03:19:15.260]  Then it was cold so then they announced that they actually thought it was going to be cold and told the government this. Now this is just unbelievable, I just don't believe them frankly. It's very possible they put out two forecasts and afterwards they would say which one they really believed in.
[03:19:15.260 --> 03:19:35.260]  It's definitely the one that was right but this is complete nonsense and bullshit and they'll do anything to say that in fact it's all caused by CO2. I mean they come up with calling, is this warming? Somehow CO2 has caused some warming somewhere which has caused a change in circulation which has caused these blasts of cold air.
[03:19:35.260 --> 03:19:53.260]  It's complete nonsense because we can predict these blasts, they're caused by solar lunar influences, nothing whatsoever to do. Unbelievable stay there, Pierce Corbin coming back with us, we'll look into the rest of 2011 into 2012, what his yearly forecast is this time.
[03:19:53.260 --> 03:20:01.260]  I know it's a little early but he'll be ready in the next few months, we'll get an early take from him on the other side. This is such important information obviously.
[03:20:01.260 --> 03:20:16.260]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over. It ended on June of 2009. The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree. Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees but for the rest of us, things seemed to be getting worse.
[03:20:16.260 --> 03:20:30.260]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either, they've begun their long expected journey to the moon. In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct. They both make fabulous investments.

He says it will change everything about our lives. The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[03:22:16.260 --> 03:22:31.260]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years. The crazy part is, he's usually right. You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties. In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[03:22:31.260 --> 03:23:00.260]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.

[03:25:44.260 --> 03:25:49.260]  So what is the current cycle point we're in right now and what do you see coming up in the next 12 months?
[03:25:49.260 --> 03:26:11.260]  Right, what we've got now is we're leaving the solar minimum. We've left solar cycle 23 and we're in the start of solar cycle 24 and it's been hiccuping and it's starting and a lot of solar activity has tended to be low.
[03:26:11.260 --> 03:26:26.260]  And at the same time we're in a very fortuitous, if you like, lunar phase in the flip cycle of the moon where we've just had some eclipses.
[03:26:26.260 --> 03:26:50.260]  And these appear to be accentuating the blocking tendencies of the jet stream which we predict and these blocking tendencies are very important for extreme events like they're leading to these extreme cold situations in Britain and Europe and your major blizzard and cold blast in America.
[03:26:50.260 --> 03:27:10.260]  They also lead to very warm bits in different parts at times but the key thing is right now the extreme cold experience and these extreme blockings are going to continue through January and February and right through the year.
[03:27:10.260 --> 03:27:29.260]  So we'll see a lot of extreme type of things, a lot more cold spells than the global warmers would like us to have and it would generally look like a kind of different weather situation where we'll go through this year compared with previous years.
[03:27:29.260 --> 03:27:37.260]  We've entered some sort of pretty fundamental shift I would say in weather patterns.
[03:27:37.260 --> 03:27:49.260]  Again, here's my simpleton question. Obviously the moon is involved in the same orbits and gyrations and is stable but the sun, do we have any idea on its short cycles?
[03:27:49.260 --> 03:27:51.260]  Obviously not its long cycles.
[03:27:51.260 --> 03:28:10.260]  So it looks to me like that's a major variable and that the sun is fluctuating and we don't know so we have to always understand that's the big wildcard because though even the ancients understood the relationship with the moon and the sea and the overall weather, isn't the sun the big wildcard?
[03:28:10.260 --> 03:28:28.260]  Well, yes and no. There are things on the sun which are happening which we can't see but we nevertheless know they happen and change the way in which the solar wind gets to us and the magnetic linkages and we can predict some of those very well.
[03:28:28.260 --> 03:28:40.260]  We know there's certain going to be shock waves if you like in the solar wind, some of which will help blocking and give us for example a cold blast in Britain or America if the blocking is in a certain place.
[03:28:40.260 --> 03:29:00.260]  So those things, however, lead to the jet stream being more mobile and it's generally wetter and milder in the northern hemisphere and we can distinguish between these two types of effect generally speaking.
[03:29:00.260 --> 03:29:21.260]  In terms of activity on the sun, I mean the important thing is it spins around on its axis so something that's happened 27 days ago may come back in 27 days every 27 days because it spins relatively early 27 days but at the same time it changes on the surface so you can't rely on that.
[03:29:21.260 --> 03:29:34.260]  So the flares come in bursts of typically every 155 days on average which is quite an important thing. There's many, many cycles and sub-cycles on the sun.
[03:29:34.260 --> 03:29:46.260]  So we do know a lot about it. Stay there. I want to come back and talk more about the sun. I want to talk about jet streams and a lot more with Pierce Corbin of weatheraction.com. I'm Alex Jones of infowars.com.
[03:29:46.260 --> 03:29:51.260]  Our final segment with our guest. Straight ahead, stay with us.

[03:31:01.260 --> 03:31:09.260]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:31:09.260 --> 03:31:14.260]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[03:31:14.260 --> 03:31:20.260]  It's a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots.
[03:31:20.260 --> 03:31:25.260]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:31:25.260 --> 03:31:35.260]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:31:35.260 --> 03:31:42.260]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[03:31:42.260 --> 03:31:49.260]  Today seems like nobody does care. Right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[03:33:01.260 --> 03:33:04.260]  This guest told, said, he can clearly say, I told you so.
[03:33:04.260 --> 03:33:10.260]  Back in November, the UK's government weather forecasting office claimed that this winter would be mild.
[03:33:10.260 --> 03:33:14.260]  That's the same office pushing a global warming agenda.
[03:33:14.260 --> 03:33:20.260]  Here's the forecast for this winter as predicted in November by astrophysicist and meteorologist Pierce Corbin.
[03:33:20.260 --> 03:33:21.260]  Take a listen.
[03:33:21.260 --> 03:33:35.260]  The winter, December to February, inclusive in Britain and Europe will be exceptionally cold and snowy like hell frozen over at times.
[03:33:35.260 --> 03:33:39.260]  He was right. It feels like that outside right now.
[03:33:39.260 --> 03:33:44.260]  We're making a video of an extremely snowy Britain from this week. So much for global warming.
[03:33:44.260 --> 03:33:49.260]  He says, prepare for the ice age. Pierce Corbin joins us now.
[03:33:49.260 --> 03:33:55.260]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[03:33:55.260 --> 03:33:59.260]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:59.260 --> 03:34:10.260]  And the resistance to the neo collectivist eugenicist is gaining steam. Republicans kill global warming committee.
[03:34:10.260 --> 03:34:17.260]  Republicans have disabled the one committee devoted solely to climate change and energy issues.
[03:34:17.260 --> 03:34:28.260]  And we have other articles at prisonplanet.com with these bizarre people openly calling for euthanizing above 65s in the Guardian.
[03:34:28.260 --> 03:34:34.260]  They do not make this type of bizarreness up calling for prison cities rationing.
[03:34:34.260 --> 03:34:42.260]  I want to get back into the science with Pierce Corbin and his forecast and he was talking about the jet stream stalling over in Australia.
[03:34:42.260 --> 03:34:51.260]  But I'd seen alternative media claim that the blizzard was caused by a stalling of the main jet streams and he said absolutely.
[03:34:51.260 --> 03:34:54.260]  And I looked it up during the break turns out he did predict that as well.
[03:34:54.260 --> 03:35:02.260]  That's pretty wild. We'll get into all of that in his forecast going into this year, which the plaminaries are out on.
[03:35:02.260 --> 03:35:05.260]  He'll have more in the next few months with a full year forecast.
[03:35:05.260 --> 03:35:23.260]  But Pierce Corbin, what do you make of the eco greenies really going from claiming they're trying to save us from global warming to now just flailing around calling for eco fascism and engaging in such bizarre rhetoric?
[03:35:23.260 --> 03:35:31.260]  Well, it is very worrying and it's not anything I would have imagined they are so bad.
[03:35:31.260 --> 03:35:41.260]  For example, just Fox News and ABC have carried me and I've been in various alternative and some newspapers in Britain.
[03:35:41.260 --> 03:36:03.260]  But the BBC have totally, absolutely, totally ignored what I've got to say. And you know, after these blizzards and so on in Britain and in America, all they can do is have apologies for global warming turning up on the TV saying things like cold is warm and we don't know what is going to happen next.
[03:36:03.260 --> 03:36:04.260]  Well, that's an exact quote.
[03:36:04.260 --> 03:36:05.260]  They could ask us.
[03:36:05.260 --> 03:36:10.260]  Well, that's an exact quote though. They're actually saying the new warm is cold. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
[03:36:10.260 --> 03:36:22.260]  Yeah, they are. They've got some bizarre sort of idea that well, it was a warm somewhere which caused a bit of something to happen in the Arctic and that caused this cold blast.
[03:36:22.260 --> 03:36:31.260]  Well, excuse me, you know, we predicted these events anyway using solar lunar activity. I mean, all their predictions have failed.
[03:36:31.260 --> 03:36:46.260]  These are the same people who told us that Europe would be without snow. But by the end of this decade and instead we've got more snow than we've ever had in the coldest December for over 100 years.
[03:36:46.260 --> 03:36:55.260]  Incredible. I mean, I understand there's micro climates everywhere, but I mean, is it the coldest in 1300? I mean, what's your data showing?
[03:36:55.260 --> 03:37:21.260]  I don't say because we haven't got the data, but certainly we're expecting a continuing decline in the world temperatures so that we will be seeing the, on a more regular basis, the coldest winters for some, you know, two or 300 years will start to become a lot more common.
[03:37:21.260 --> 03:37:33.260]  Jet streams, for those that don't know, describe them, please, sir. And what's happening with the jet streams? You did predict there'd be a slowing or a stalling and I asked you in press reports here that it may have stalled.
[03:37:33.260 --> 03:37:35.260]  We're accurate. You said they are.
[03:37:35.260 --> 03:37:55.260]  Yes. What you have at the jet stream is the general track of the low pressure systems around the polar regions. So they go one way in the northern hemisphere and the other way in the southern hemisphere. And generally when it's stalled in one, it will be stalled in the other half as well of the world.
[03:37:55.260 --> 03:38:15.260]  What happened during that New York blizzard or just before it was, for example, that we had a forecast we'd put out in detail that there'd be eastern, northeast USA, including New York would be hit by an almighty blizzard and it would be country or that part would grind to a halt.
[03:38:15.260 --> 03:38:26.260]  Now, we said that in detail again two weeks ahead and Standard Meteorology said, and we've got emails from people saying, oh, no, we can't see any of this coming here. No, it ain't going to happen.
[03:38:26.260 --> 03:38:37.260]  And then they saw something and said, no, it's going to go out to sea. It won't hit New York, anything like much at all. And then 24 hours ahead, they started admitting that it was going to happen.
[03:38:37.260 --> 03:38:47.260]  And when it did happen, it was even more intense than they had said 24 hours ahead and much more in line with what we had said in detail weeks ahead.
[03:38:47.260 --> 03:38:57.260]  So we are very pleased with that. Although I have to admit, I feel sorry for all those people who were stuck in the ice who were ill-prepared because Standard Meteorology didn't help them.
[03:38:57.260 --> 03:39:07.260]  Well, I go back to what I raised earlier. How, if it's admitted in the ancients knew this, that the moon controls the tides.
[03:39:07.260 --> 03:39:26.260]  I mean, if the moon is generating giant seas globally, sucking the water out many feet lower, bringing it in many feet higher, to say then that it doesn't affect weather when 78% of the service of the earth is covered by salt or fresh water.
[03:39:26.260 --> 03:39:34.260]  I mean, it's just completely ridiculous. How can they say? I mean, it's just, it's beyond ridiculous. They know they're lying.
[03:39:34.260 --> 03:39:42.260]  They do. They know they're lying. But of course, there's big interest attached to this. I mean, people, they're self-serving pseudo-scientists.
[03:39:42.260 --> 03:39:58.260]  And the politicians in Taiwan, the scientists are in Taiwan, the politicians, whatever. I mean, they want carbon trading to make fast bucks. They want to control the development of energy trading around the world.
[03:39:58.260 --> 03:40:10.260]  They want to control agriculture a lot more. And they want the population to be stupefied and brainwashed and to actually desire to pay taxes to save the planet.
[03:40:10.260 --> 03:40:17.260]  Now, there's never been a movement in the history of the world before where people have been clamoring to pay taxes for any reason.
[03:40:17.260 --> 03:40:35.260]  Now, this is a fantastic opportunity for all tax collectors and governments, and they're not going to give it up lightly, which is why they will, you know, use the state media to suppress opinions of people like me and put brainwashing sidekicks on instead.
[03:40:35.260 --> 03:40:43.260]  Here's Corbyn going back to the BBC. It took them over a month to report on Climate Gate after it was already a huge story.
[03:40:43.260 --> 03:40:53.260]  And now they still barely report on it and say it was an honest mistake when the emails clearly show premeditated lying by the UN-picked scientists.
[03:40:53.260 --> 03:41:06.260]  But it expands from there. Since then, like a line of 100 dominoes, every major fraud they've pushed has turned out to be a manifest premeditated charade.
[03:41:06.260 --> 03:41:11.260]  I mean, where do you see their hubris going? Are they running out of gas?
[03:41:11.260 --> 03:41:23.260]  Well, they are running out of gas, but they do keep on filling up the tank. You see, the global warming scam is worth billions, billions.
[03:41:23.260 --> 03:41:44.260]  I mean, we point out in our first news sheet of the year, which anyone can get on our website, Weather Action News No. 1, for 2011, we point out that they've just put up value-added tax, but they don't need to put up value-added tax at all if they were to scrap the pseudoscience of man-made global warming,
[03:41:44.260 --> 03:42:02.260]  because that could save $18 billion a year. Putting up VAT is going to get them $13 billion. So to do something intelligent in line with real science would actually, you know, get an increase of $5 billion, which they wouldn't have to do anything but to do with VAT.
[03:42:02.260 --> 03:42:12.260]  All right. We've only got about three or four minutes left with you. Other points. I mean, I've been asking the questions in your forecast coming up, again, here in the United States, other parts of the world.
[03:42:12.260 --> 03:42:27.260]  You called what happened in Central Asia with precision, the Russia heatway with precision. Give us a brief, because I know you're still compiling for the next year, but your brief long-term forecast in hot spots around the world or the United States?
[03:42:27.260 --> 03:42:46.260]  Well, we haven't gone into a lot of detail yet, and we will do a lot more detail for the United States of America. But right now, we can certainly say that Western Europe and Britain is going to have a lousy spring and a wet summer.
[03:42:46.260 --> 03:43:07.260]  In America, it's very likely that parts of America will be like that. But we do have to be careful and understand how the jet stream is going to affect things because last year, for example, last winter, we had very mild on the Pacific coast when it was cold elsewhere.
[03:43:07.260 --> 03:43:10.260]  So we have to see where the distinctions are going to be.
[03:43:10.260 --> 03:43:22.260]  Just to interrupt you, sir, I mean, just to interrupt, as you're using English nomenclature, quantify for us, what does a lousy spring or what do those terms mean?
[03:43:22.260 --> 03:43:36.260]  Lousy means cold and wet. So in terms of forming, it means that the sprouting of crops would be late. So it's bad for agriculture and bad for the economy.
[03:43:36.260 --> 03:43:40.260]  OK, continue now with what you were saying for the summer.
[03:43:40.260 --> 03:44:04.260]  Yes. Well, in Britain, it will be generally wet or very wet, and it will be probably also a lot of extreme type wet events in America. But we don't know where as yet, and we will have to work that out and let people know.
[03:44:04.260 --> 03:44:10.260]  How did you predict the Pakistan flooding? How did you predict the Russian record heat wave?
[03:44:10.260 --> 03:44:35.260]  Right. Well, our look back map as to when there were similar weather, solar, magnetic lunar forcing in the past showed us that there was going to be high pressure blocking in East Europe and Russia, which would give a hot, safe wind and cause that hot. And that occurred again and again and again in the weather map, so we knew it would be a heat wave.
[03:44:35.260 --> 03:44:50.260]  In terms of Pakistan, we didn't have any maps of Pakistan, so we didn't have any prediction that what would occur did occur. But when we saw what was happening for Russia, we could also see when it was going to end.
[03:44:50.260 --> 03:45:01.260]  And we could also see that that meant that the super deluge is in Pakistan would end at the same time because the whole pattern around the world was going to change.
[03:45:01.260 --> 03:45:16.260]  So we predicted to the day when there would be the end of the Russian heat wave and the final gasp of storms which would then completely peter out in Pakistan and end that the super deluge is there.
[03:45:16.260 --> 03:45:19.260]  And those happened to the day.
[03:45:19.260 --> 03:45:36.260]  But you're saying a general cooling trend in the next few years or an accelerated one? Yes. An accelerated one, I would say. Just on that Russian thing, it was very interesting, you could plot on the sun what actually happened.
[03:45:36.260 --> 03:45:56.260]  There was a double sunspot, coronal explosion and 12 hours after that you had massive thunderstorms in St. Petersburg and then later in Moscow and the situation also changed in Pakistan.
[03:45:56.260 --> 03:46:14.260]  And in terms of what's happening in general over the next few years, yes, we think there will be accelerated cooling and if you like, this year is the beginning of quite rapid decline of world temperatures.
[03:46:14.260 --> 03:46:29.260]  Well, Mr. Corbin, meteorologist, astrophysicist, you've been very gracious with your valuable time. Folks can go to your site and they can contribute or sign up and get your detailed forecast or get a lot of great and valuable general information all over in closing.
[03:46:29.260 --> 03:46:42.260]  Because when you're on last year, you explain to people that, and I'm putting in my words, but I want you to close in your own and tell me if I'm incorrect repeating it, but I think it's some of the most important things you describe.
[03:46:42.260 --> 03:47:02.260]  The fanciest computers, the best systems can't integrate all the different magnetic fields of the earth, the moon relationship, the sun. All we can do is look back at past events, not so much modeling, but then being able to predict what happened because of where the positions were.
[03:47:02.260 --> 03:47:17.260]  That makes total sense, that's what you're doing, that's why you're so accurate, and that's completely different from pinhead so-called scientists trying to fit the science and their limited technological meters to how they believe things work.
[03:47:17.260 --> 03:47:31.260]  Yes, absolutely right. The current approach of what's called itself climate science is arrogant beyond belief. They imagine that their machine is no more about nature than nature does itself.
[03:47:31.260 --> 03:47:47.260]  Nature is its own computer. In fact, we could never construct anything advanced enough to compute everything that happened in the sun, between the sun and the earth and the earth, to give the details of what happens.
[03:47:47.260 --> 03:48:04.260]  We can look at the past as to when very similar things were driving, and that is how we make our predictions. We try to understand nature instead of assuming we are understanding it and able to control it, which we cannot.
[03:48:04.260 --> 03:48:13.260]  I remember reading Farmer's Almanac when I was a kid, and they said it was all about the moon. They didn't know why, they just knew there was a relationship.
[03:48:13.260 --> 03:48:30.260]  That's absolutely right. It's obviously, well, not obviously, but it isn't just the tidal matter which happens every fortnight, but it's also the whole cycle of the moon, indeed the whole cycle of eclipses, which is a 19-year cycle.
[03:48:30.260 --> 03:48:47.260]  There's many sub-cycles within that, you see, of the moon crossing the plane of the ecliptic, as well as new and forward moves and all the relative timings between that and events, those things and events on the sun, which are crucial.
[03:48:47.260 --> 03:48:54.260]  Well, your accuracy rate is the proof that you are a true scientist and a real treasure. Thank you for spending time with us.
[03:48:54.260 --> 03:48:56.260]  Thank you very much. It's great to be with you.
[03:48:56.260 --> 03:49:00.260]  All right, there goes Pierce Corbin, weatheraction.com. Have a great new year, sir.
[03:49:00.260 --> 03:49:18.260]  Well, that was amazing, ladies and gentlemen, and 85% accuracy rate a year out. I mean, it's just incredible because he's a real scientist and knows the sun and the moon are affecting much of what happens on Earth.
[03:49:18.260 --> 03:49:44.260]  The Earth's own magnetic field affects that, and people breathing trees respirating, cows passing gas, that is such a tiny effect overall, but they want to demonize normal carbon cycle so they can control it.
[03:49:44.260 --> 03:50:04.260]  While engaging in legions of true dangerous events, detonating nukes in the upper atmosphere, using DUG, open air, cross species, genetic engineering, things that in the whole history of this planet have never been done, and proving that it's causing dangerous mutations and problems,
[03:50:04.260 --> 03:50:22.260]  and huge super colliders colliding heavy particles together. I mean, all extremely dangerous, and they tell us all of that's not dangerous, but carbon dioxide is just this devil gas that's going to kill us all.
[03:50:22.260 --> 03:50:32.260]  They know it's a fraud. It is a giant, sickening, huge joke to them, and they love it.
[03:50:32.260 --> 03:50:42.260]  I will assure you that sun is the main driver. You go out there on a July day and a clear day it'll burn your skin. It's what makes the plants grow. It's what heats the Earth.
[03:50:42.260 --> 03:50:54.260]  The Earth would be so far below zero it makes your head spin. It'd be an absolute zero without the sun, and the UN says the sun doesn't affect our climate.
[03:50:54.260 --> 03:51:02.260]  Ladies and gentlemen, are we that stupid to buy that ridiculous line? Final segment straight ahead in an unbelievable retransmission.
[03:51:02.260 --> 03:51:08.260]  How well and how fast does heart and body extract work to improve blood circulation? Listen.
[03:51:08.260 --> 03:51:19.260]  My name is Ellis, and I am 66 years old and I live in Jacksonville, Florida. Two years ago I was diagnosed as having clogged arteries. I had 70% blockage in one artery leading to my heart.
[03:51:19.260 --> 03:51:31.260]  I have no complaints, but I refuse knowing the negative side effects. Heart and body extract is a unique balance, synergy, and proportion of herbs reaching from head to toe at maximum absorption around 95% at the cellular level.
[03:51:31.260 --> 03:51:38.260]  Within the first month I felt a dramatic difference. The heaviness in my legs was reduced, and within two months I felt completely normal.
[03:51:38.260 --> 03:51:53.260]  The natural organic herbal formula for heart health is heart and body extract. Heart and body extract comes with a 100% ironclad money-back guarantee. Details at hbextract.com or call 866-295-5305 for heart and body extract.
[03:51:53.260 --> 03:52:09.260]  866-295-5305 for heart and body extract. A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[03:52:09.260 --> 03:52:17.260]  He says it will change everything about our lives. The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[03:52:17.260 --> 03:52:28.260]  A man has made some outrageous predictions over the years. The crazy part is, he's usually right. You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[03:52:28.260 --> 03:52:39.260]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy. Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[03:52:39.260 --> 03:53:00.260]  I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video online today. He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself. You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com. That's End of America. The number 3.com.

[03:54:10.260 --> 03:54:22.260]  I got into the unbelievable open announcements that they're going to turn the cities into prison cities to control our every move, and they literally call us prisoners and ration everything we do.
[03:54:22.260 --> 03:54:34.260]  We've also got new reports out by Watson, Maryland Stage Terror plot, FBI caught provocaturing patsies. We're trying to make that a big search term, Maryland Stage Terror, those three words, and also prison cities today.
[03:54:34.260 --> 03:54:42.260]  In fact, let's check Google Trends. We did that in the first hour. It should be becoming the number one trend in the next 30 minutes or so. It is going to become the number one trend.
[03:54:42.260 --> 03:54:49.260]  I think we've only failed a few times and had it in the top five or so. But I would imagine the listeners come through big time against the enemy.
[03:54:49.260 --> 03:54:53.260]  So we'll check Google Trends right now. I've got a few other news items I want to hit.
[03:54:53.260 --> 03:55:04.260]  But first, talking about the sun, that thing that doesn't affect our climate, according to the United Nations, because they say so. That's like saying water isn't wet.
[03:55:04.260 --> 03:55:08.260]  I mean, it's just such a ridiculous lie on the face of it, and they know full well.
[03:55:08.260 --> 03:55:21.260]  My solar backup. Have you lost your power? Want to simply flip the switch on to get the lights back on? If so, you should check out mysolarbackup.com, because there's never been a better time to start getting off the grid and to generate your own supply of electrical power.
[03:55:21.260 --> 03:55:26.260]  I myself am moving out to the countryside and going solar and rainwater and all that. I'm done.
[03:55:26.260 --> 03:55:30.260]  I mean, I can't leave the country, so I'm going to do the next best thing.
[03:55:30.260 --> 03:55:36.260]  Go to mysolarbackup.com. They've got a great unit, and you can buy a bunch of them and run your whole house.
[03:55:36.260 --> 03:55:48.260]  Mysolarbackup.com, 877-327-0365. The government doesn't own the sun yet, folks, so mysolarbackup.com, 877-327-0365.
[03:55:48.260 --> 03:56:03.260]  A lot of other news I didn't get to, and for some reason it's like it's impossible to get to this, because I covered the eugenics today, and I meant to then integrate it in with the surveillance city that they're creating.
[03:56:03.260 --> 03:56:16.260]  Each city to be a total panoptagon, but the spy satellites for global warming are really spy satellites that track your heat resonance, that they get your body heat resonance biometric code, and they track you by satellite.
[03:56:16.260 --> 03:56:21.260]  That's now mainstream news. Detroit Public Schools getting 40,000 laptop stimulus funds.
[03:56:21.260 --> 03:56:24.260]  The federal government will watch the kids over those, just like Pennsylvania.
[03:56:24.260 --> 03:56:32.260]  Computers that see you and keep watch over you, I've been talking about this since Monday. Never got to it.
[03:56:32.260 --> 03:56:38.260]  It's such an incredible article. It says everything you do will be watched in live time for your own good.
[03:56:38.260 --> 03:56:47.260]  I mean, they just announced total 1984. It says here that prisoners will be watched, but also doctors and nurses making sure they wash their hands.
[03:56:47.260 --> 03:56:57.260]  Guilty of the proven innocent. Again, it says computer vision systems can watch hospital room and remind doctors to nurses to wash their hands or warn of restless patients.
[03:56:57.260 --> 03:57:01.260]  Oh, they say you didn't take care of your baby right. They'll take your kid. That's already going in in England.
[03:57:01.260 --> 03:57:09.260]  Who are in danger of falling out of bed. It can go through a computer equipped system and the computer decides and then alerts people.
[03:57:09.260 --> 03:57:14.260]  And then that's actually in the news today. DARPA claims they're just now rolling the sound.
[03:57:14.260 --> 03:57:19.260]  Utah's 1.5 billion cybersecurity center underway. They already built one in San Antonio.
[03:57:19.260 --> 03:57:25.260]  Court OK searches of cell phones without warrant. They're just openly announcing or spying on everything.
[03:57:25.260 --> 03:57:33.260]  That's San Francisco Chronicle. What's trader where all these new iPhone apps and other droid apps that spy on you and everybody else?
[03:57:33.260 --> 03:57:45.260]  Tattletale apps. U.S. tells agencies watch insiders to prevent new WikiLeaks and saying anybody who doesn't act happy or enthusiastic may be a trader.
[03:57:45.260 --> 03:57:51.260]  So it's just, again, the panopticon of total spying to ensure the criminality of the government corporations continues.
[03:57:51.260 --> 03:57:56.260]  She telling the truth is becoming a crime or exposing crime is becoming a crime.
[03:57:56.260 --> 03:58:02.260]  I'm out of time on that, but I'm going to go back into this more tomorrow as promised.
[03:58:02.260 --> 03:58:08.260]  More very informative guests tomorrow. Excellent job in the four hour transmission today by the great crew.
[03:58:08.260 --> 03:58:21.260]  Marley, Sharon, Bill, Matt, everybody. Absolutely. Who else? Oh, yes, yes. And Phil Burto as well.
[03:58:21.260 --> 03:58:29.260]  So everybody has done a super job today. Another strike against tyranny. Another emergency transmission to wake folks up.
[03:58:29.260 --> 03:58:37.260]  Now coming up the retransmission at infowords.com, the stations at Rearit, I'm breaking down the incredible eugenics announcements that are off the charts and saying
[03:58:37.260 --> 03:58:40.260]  they confirm our worst fears. See you back live tomorrow at Amcentral.
