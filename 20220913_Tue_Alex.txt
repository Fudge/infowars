[00:00.000 --> 00:06.800]  But we're taking people out of the country. You wouldn't believe how bad these people
[00:06.800 --> 00:11.360]  are. These aren't people. These are animals.
[00:11.360 --> 00:17.280]  The mouthpieces of globalism have long traded the safety of everyday Americans for a vague
[00:17.280 --> 00:23.880]  rallying cry of combating racism to harness the power they obsess over. Abandoning any
[00:23.880 --> 00:29.000]  responsibility for the terrorism they have lured across our border.
[00:29.000 --> 00:34.040]  And so when the President of the United States says about undocumented immigrants, these
[00:34.040 --> 00:42.480]  aren't people. These are animals. You have to wonder, does he not believe in the spark
[00:42.480 --> 00:45.880]  of divinity, the dignity and worth of every person?
[00:45.880 --> 00:49.800]  We've had racists, and they've existed. They've tried to get elected president. He's the first
[00:49.800 --> 00:50.880]  one that has.
[00:50.880 --> 00:57.240]  We do not stifle dissent. We do not otherwise or so hatred. And we certainly never say go
[00:57.240 --> 01:04.800]  back to your country, to a brown or a black person, because that is a racist trope.
[01:04.800 --> 01:11.120]  We just testified to Congress back in 2016 that special interest aliens do not necessarily
[01:11.120 --> 01:17.120]  have connections to terrorism. As Stephanie pointed out, they often mean that they have
[01:17.120 --> 01:22.680]  travel patterns that go to countries where you get secondary screening, or you are from
[01:22.680 --> 01:26.080]  a country where there may have been terrorists at some time.
[01:26.080 --> 01:29.280]  So just that they are terrorists is just, it's a lot.
[01:29.280 --> 01:34.920]  The unyielding gaslighting projected from the Democrats has smothered crucial intel on the
[01:34.920 --> 01:41.760]  infiltration of cells all across a wide open United States that an unsuspecting public
[01:41.760 --> 01:47.760]  must be aware of before the hammer falls yet again on American soil.
[01:47.760 --> 01:53.720]  On the morning of September 11th, 2001, 19 men armed with box cutters directed by a man
[01:53.720 --> 01:58.000]  on dialysis in a cave fortress halfway around the world using a satellite phone and a laptop
[01:58.000 --> 02:01.720]  directed the most sophisticated penetration of the most heavily defended airspace in the
[02:01.720 --> 02:02.720]  world.
[02:02.720 --> 02:06.640]  Overpowering the passengers and the military combat train pilots on four commercial aircraft
[02:06.640 --> 02:10.440]  before flying those planes wildly off course for over an hour without being molested by
[02:10.440 --> 02:12.320]  a single fighter interceptor.
[02:12.320 --> 02:16.760]  These 19 hijackers, devout religious fundamentalists who like to drink alcohol snort cocaine and
[02:16.760 --> 02:20.000]  live with pink haired strippers, managed to knock down three buildings with two planes
[02:20.000 --> 02:23.720]  in New York, while in Washington a pilot who couldn't handle a single-engine Cessna was
[02:23.720 --> 02:28.800]  able to fly a 757 and an 8000 foot descending 270 degree corkscrew turn to come exactly
[02:28.800 --> 02:32.760]  level with the ground, hitting the Pentagon in the budget analyst office where DOD staffers
[02:32.760 --> 02:36.920]  were working on the mystery of the $2.3 trillion dollars the Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld
[02:36.920 --> 02:40.400]  had announced missing from the Pentagon's coffers in a press conference the day before
[02:40.400 --> 02:42.680]  on September 10th, 2001.
[02:42.680 --> 02:48.640]  That is, until stories like this bubble to the surface, as a New Mexico man was indicted
[02:48.640 --> 02:56.000]  for allegedly trying to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization.
[02:56.000 --> 03:01.840]  45-year-old Herman Wilson has been trying to help militant Islamist group ISIS since
[03:01.840 --> 03:04.280]  at least 2020.
[03:04.280 --> 03:08.640]  Federal documents filed by the U.S. Attorney's Office say the Albuquerque man wanted to go
[03:08.640 --> 03:14.600]  to Egypt to support the terrorist organization, even using the online platform Telegram to
[03:14.600 --> 03:15.760]  recruit others.
[03:15.760 --> 03:20.920]  A confidential informant recruited through Telegram told investigators Wilson was training
[03:20.920 --> 03:25.800]  them how to fight on behalf of the terrorist organization and drove them to Kirtland Air
[03:25.800 --> 03:30.640]  Force Base to show them how, quote, easy it was to get through security.
[03:30.640 --> 03:37.400]  A federal grand jury indicted Herman LeVon Wilson, also known as Bilal Moon Min Abdullah.
[03:37.400 --> 03:44.080]  Wilson attempted to create an Islamic State Center in New Mexico that would offer ISIS
[03:44.080 --> 03:50.000]  ideology teachings and provide training in tactical maneuvers and martial arts.
[03:50.000 --> 03:55.720]  The center was allegedly meant to serve as a safe haven for individuals preparing to
[03:55.720 --> 04:01.840]  travel and fight on behalf of ISIS in the United States and abroad.
[04:01.840 --> 04:06.960]  This according to the same Department of Justice that has turned a blind eye to the creeping
[04:06.960 --> 04:12.880]  cartel dominance on U.S. soil with a growing allegiance to these terrorists.
[04:12.880 --> 04:17.840]  The evidence of terrorism crossing our border is numerous, as The Washington Times reported
[04:17.840 --> 04:23.760]  on June 16th of this year that the Border Patrol agents nabbed 15 people at the southern
[04:23.760 --> 04:29.240]  border in May who were on the FBI's terrorist screening database, showing the free-for-all
[04:29.240 --> 04:32.320]  along the U.S.-Mexico boundary is unabated.
[04:32.320 --> 04:37.320]  The number of people on the terrorist watch list caught crossing the border is a record
[04:37.320 --> 04:44.400]  for any month, equaling all of 2021 and more than the Border Patrol found from 2017 to
[04:44.400 --> 04:46.720]  2020 combined.
[04:46.720 --> 04:52.720]  Contrary to the fantasies of Saul Linsky's egotistical neophytes jabbering away on the
[04:52.720 --> 04:56.440]  idiot box, the threat is very real.
[04:56.440 --> 05:26.280]  John Bown reporting.
[05:56.440 --> 06:23.240]  Here's today at 25% off at MFullWordStore.com, now back in stock.
[06:23.240 --> 06:30.840]  Everybody knows about the frog and the boiling pot of water analogy, it's actually true.
[06:30.840 --> 06:36.360]  The folks down in Louisiana and Mississippi like to eat their crawdads and their bull
[06:36.360 --> 06:42.800]  frogs and the rest of it and well sometimes they just throw the whole frog in the boiling
[06:42.800 --> 06:47.440]  pot but they've learned that if you throw one into boiling water he'll just jump right
[06:47.440 --> 06:48.440]  out.
[06:48.440 --> 06:53.960]  But if you set him in a cool pot of water and he just turns the heat up slow he thinks
[06:53.960 --> 06:59.040]  it's a hot tub at first and then passes out and dies a painless death.
[06:59.040 --> 07:02.040]  And that's where America and the world is right now.
[07:02.040 --> 07:07.720]  We're in the middle of the New World Order, great reset, takedown of civilization, the
[07:07.720 --> 07:14.720]  destruction of the entire mom and pop infrastructure from farming to ranching to local stores and
[07:14.720 --> 07:15.720]  communities.
[07:15.720 --> 07:24.080]  And this is a scientific technocracy takeover to force us onto the AI global social credit
[07:24.080 --> 07:27.120]  score cashless society system.
[07:27.120 --> 07:32.920]  Now being aware of this is the key to winning and whether you're in Sweden or whether you're
[07:32.920 --> 07:40.680]  in Italy or whether you're in Canada there are either people that are anti-globalist
[07:40.680 --> 07:47.560]  anti-WEF anti-great reset winning in their primaries or winning the prime ministerships
[07:47.560 --> 07:53.080]  and the presidencies and that's just this week it's spreading all over the planet.
[07:53.080 --> 07:58.160]  So the globalists are in trouble and this fight is literally in a tie position right
[07:58.160 --> 08:00.640]  now.
[08:00.640 --> 08:05.880]  We here at Info Wars that means you this family have to be the tip of the spear and have to
[08:05.880 --> 08:08.160]  realize how critical this is.
[08:08.160 --> 08:13.960]  If you think 8.9% inflation is bad, if you think collapsing borders is bad, if you think
[08:13.960 --> 08:18.560]  all the terrible things in wars and police state and political purges and censorship
[08:18.560 --> 08:23.400]  and cashless societies and gun purchases being tracked by the credit card companies illegally
[08:23.400 --> 08:30.840]  and putting you in a database, if you think that's bad you ain't seen nothing yet.
[08:30.840 --> 08:34.000]  So this isn't something where people can hide under the table and hope the storm passes
[08:34.000 --> 08:35.840]  over.
[08:35.840 --> 08:44.720]  We have to meet this whole situation absolutely head on and that's where we are as a culture
[08:44.720 --> 08:45.720]  and as a civilization.
[08:45.720 --> 08:50.920]  Now to give you an example of how we're winning the culture war, Tucker Carlson talked last
[08:50.920 --> 08:57.960]  night about the horrible next level of deception and censorship that is taking place at the
[08:57.960 --> 09:02.280]  master of lies the New York Times.
[09:02.280 --> 09:04.400]  Here it is.
[09:04.400 --> 09:06.880]  Next how dishonest is the New York Times?
[09:06.880 --> 09:10.080]  It's really a philosophical question, it's hard to answer directly.
[09:10.080 --> 09:15.360]  Let's see, how drunk was the guy you saw passed out in the men's room at a Packers game?
[09:15.360 --> 09:18.040]  How angry is Hillary Clinton at her husband?
[09:18.040 --> 09:23.480]  Well the answer in all cases is very, extremely, so thoroughly and so totally that it's hard
[09:23.480 --> 09:25.200]  to put into words.
[09:25.200 --> 09:29.240]  So instead of describing the dishonesty of the New York Times with conventional adjectives
[09:29.240 --> 09:32.800]  we'll give you a specific example because we think it tells you more.
[09:32.800 --> 09:36.880]  So last week the paper told us that the bestselling book in the United States was a title called
[09:36.880 --> 09:42.200]  I'm Glad My Mom Died by a child actress called Jeanette McCurdy but that was not true, that
[09:42.200 --> 09:44.800]  book was not the bestselling book in America.
[09:44.800 --> 09:49.920]  In fact the bestselling book in America last week was The Great Reset and the War for the
[09:49.920 --> 09:53.640]  World written by Alex Jones.
[09:53.640 --> 09:57.560]  Jones sold more than 56,000 copies of his book last week.
[09:57.560 --> 10:04.960]  Jeanette McCurdy, whatever her merits, we have no idea, sold 34,686 copies of her book.
[10:04.960 --> 10:10.080]  So Alex Jones sold a lot more books, Alex Jones had the biggest book in the country
[10:10.080 --> 10:12.880]  but the New York Times lied about that because the New York Times doesn't want you to know
[10:12.880 --> 10:13.880]  that.
[10:13.880 --> 10:17.040]  The New York Times wants you to believe that Alex Jones is more discredited than the New
[10:17.040 --> 10:18.120]  York Times.
[10:18.120 --> 10:22.240]  The paper that started the Iraq War by lying about weapons mass destruction and got a million
[10:22.240 --> 10:23.240]  people killed.
[10:23.240 --> 10:27.400]  But Alex Jones is worse, he's a mental patient, no one listens to him.
[10:27.400 --> 10:32.880]  So they lied about his book, what else are they lying about, no wonder.
[10:32.880 --> 10:37.880]  So let me respond to the book being number one, that was 50 plus thousand books sold
[10:37.880 --> 10:41.920]  in stores last week.
[10:41.920 --> 10:46.400]  In pre-sales, in the month before, if you actually add them up, it's been number one
[10:46.400 --> 10:51.840]  but they've manipulated the numbers for a month and the other big book publishing operations
[10:51.840 --> 10:55.600]  admit it's number one or number two on every chart.
[10:55.600 --> 10:58.400]  Now a lot of listeners will say, well that's great, Jones, you don't have any money problems
[10:58.400 --> 10:59.400]  now.
[10:59.400 --> 11:07.040]  Well, it's true, I got paid $80,000 yesterday for the first month of pre-sales, that's after
[11:07.040 --> 11:11.280]  all the costs and expenses and what it costs to put them in bookstores and do it all.
[11:11.280 --> 11:15.760]  The publisher makes about $8 and I make about a dollar and a half, $2.
[11:15.760 --> 11:20.120]  So I got $80,000 and I just directed them this morning to shoot it into free speech
[11:20.120 --> 11:23.520]  systems to keep my employees and this operation going.
[11:23.520 --> 11:27.360]  Not to making money is a bad thing, but let's just have to understand, yes, I'll probably
[11:27.360 --> 11:31.360]  get a couple million dollars for this book in the next six months and I'm going to shoot
[11:31.360 --> 11:36.880]  it into info wars to keep this operation going because the satellite uplinks and the
[11:36.880 --> 11:43.880]  bandwidth and the rest of us are costing us $300,000 a month and the more popular we get
[11:43.880 --> 11:46.760]  with our own platform, the more money I've got to pay.
[11:46.760 --> 11:52.000]  So I'm not bitching and complaining, I'm just simply saying, we've hit the zeitgeist,
[11:52.000 --> 11:56.080]  we are in the pole position, we are winning, we are hurting them, we are inspiring, liberty
[11:56.080 --> 12:01.880]  movements worldwide, that means you are, but I need funds and quite frankly, buying the
[12:01.880 --> 12:05.560]  book sends a message, it's the Death Star plans, it exposes the new world order, they
[12:05.560 --> 12:10.360]  can't stand it, so get it infowarshore.com or get it amazon.com or get it Barnes & Nobles,
[12:10.360 --> 12:11.360]  that's all fine and dandy.
[12:11.360 --> 12:16.160]  But if you want to support the broadcast where we actually do bring some money in, I'm going
[12:16.160 --> 12:20.600]  to hit on the news, get what's been sold out for over a year, green fiber capsules, the
[12:20.600 --> 12:25.800]  highest quality from wheatgrass and cilantro and other things that are known to energize

[12:52.760 --> 12:55.040]  energy without any speed in it.

[13:02.360 --> 13:06.240]  and then we make 15 bucks on the bottle that we need to fund this operation.
[13:06.240 --> 13:14.240]  Separately, Rain Force Plus, which is just an upgraded clone of the five or six top selling
[13:14.240 --> 13:18.760]  brands that are healthy, clean, and new tropics, you can buy stuff like this all over the place,
[13:18.760 --> 13:22.440]  most stuff is really bad and toxic and gives you a come down, this doesn't, is this the
[13:22.440 --> 13:26.480]  number one pill in the world, no, but it's less price than similar brands that do the
[13:26.480 --> 13:31.760]  same thing and it funds the info war, good, clean energy, five to six hours of it, Rain

[13:57.240 --> 14:02.200]  out to a movie, I don't want to go, boom, five or six drops under the tongue, 15 minutes
[14:02.200 --> 14:08.160]  later, I've got this good, clean energy that isn't like speed, but you're just awake.
[14:08.160 --> 14:13.120]  It is 25% off, Rain Force Ultra, infowarstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three,

[14:16.360 --> 14:23.000]  big news, inflation's off the hook, business sales across the border down, we're going
[14:23.000 --> 14:28.240]  into a depression with inflation, that's stagflation, we're all in deep trouble and I'm just asking
[14:28.240 --> 14:32.680]  listeners to understand the storm is here, it's not coming and with all the things you
[14:32.680 --> 14:38.960]  do in life, supporting corporate brands, supporting football games, all this crap, please set
[14:38.960 --> 14:44.240]  aside some money to keep info wars on the air because we're in chapter five bankruptcy
[14:44.240 --> 14:47.880]  and the next few months it will be decided whether we continue on or this shuts down
[14:47.880 --> 14:52.440]  and we are barely profitable and we've got to be able to show we're profitable as this
[14:52.440 --> 14:57.280]  plan goes forward in just the next six weeks, so now is the most critical time in info wars

[16:05.240 --> 16:11.040]  got brain force plus and you've got brain force ultra, which one is better, and that's
[16:11.040 --> 16:20.760]  like asking what's better, a Ford F-150 or a Cadillac or a Ferrari, it's different strokes
[16:20.760 --> 16:25.960]  for different folks, it varies, all three are different formulas, all three do different
[16:25.960 --> 16:31.800]  things, turbo force is 10 hours of clean, out of control energy, I can't even take
[16:31.800 --> 16:38.680]  a whole pack myself, brain force plus is a long term acting clean, this brain force
[16:38.680 --> 16:45.680]  ultra is a super fast acting, new tropic that creates incredible clarity but doesn't last
[16:45.680 --> 16:51.520]  very long, they're all three different formulas, and finally, back at stock, massively discounted,

[17:58.600 --> 17:59.600]  happens with your dreams.

[18:04.760 --> 18:09.760]  a doctor, a lawyer, or a millionaire, Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles,
[18:09.760 --> 18:11.120]  you see it every year.
[18:11.120 --> 18:16.160]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers, 50 different tax returns, 50 different answers,
[18:16.160 --> 18:21.960]  and almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups,
[18:21.960 --> 18:25.360]  because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding
[18:25.360 --> 18:30.080]  this and knowing this, so it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things
[18:30.080 --> 18:36.320]  out there hurting everybody, to be able to do things tax wise, it's legal and lawful
[18:36.320 --> 18:39.360]  that allows you to keep more of your money, we wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten
[18:39.360 --> 18:42.960]  great tax advice in the last few years.
[18:42.960 --> 18:50.040]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL, jonestaxrelief.com, one word, jonestaxrelief.com,
[18:50.040 --> 18:57.040]  or call 833-900-4285.
[18:57.040 --> 19:06.440]  Our world is so full of hype, we are force fed dehumanizing propaganda by the corporate
[19:06.440 --> 19:12.000]  media, by the controlled churches and the universities, and why is this the case?
[19:12.000 --> 19:16.920]  Because we innately, by God, have been given the keys for our own minds, our own psyches,
[19:16.920 --> 19:22.800]  our own souls, and by connecting to God, we can empower ourselves and trend, send, the
[19:22.800 --> 19:28.920]  quote, fallen or sinful state, so the chemicals that we ingest and all the things we try to
[19:28.920 --> 19:34.280]  bring into our bodies to change who we are, are only lowering us, they're only making
[19:34.280 --> 19:39.080]  us more depressed, from the end they're only making us less fulfilled, it is only by going
[19:39.080 --> 19:43.800]  within and really making that connection to God that we can truly empower ourselves.
[19:43.800 --> 19:47.800]  That's why the globalist, bombardist, and toxins and chemicals to block us getting the
[19:47.800 --> 19:53.160]  normal vitamins and minerals and trace elements our bodies need to be healthy and to be able
[19:53.160 --> 19:57.560]  to basically reach out beyond the third dimension, and that's where the incredible products come
[19:57.560 --> 20:01.280]  in at infomerstore.com.
[20:01.280 --> 20:08.280]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:47.280 --> 20:52.280]  Well, you might not make it back.
[20:52.280 --> 20:57.280]  What matters for our children is we win this fight, what happens to us doesn't matter,
[20:57.280 --> 21:04.280]  and in that challenge, in that conflict, we will find the road to God.
[21:05.280 --> 21:09.280]  It's a spiritual fight, make no mistake.
[21:17.280 --> 21:23.280]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, you believe me, you.
[21:23.280 --> 21:28.280]  I'm going to be opening up the phone lines at the start of the next segment until Dr.
[21:28.280 --> 21:33.780]  Peter Bregan is a very famous, well-known, top psychiatrist who years ago wrote a book
[21:33.780 --> 21:38.280]  exposing what the COVID-19 tyranny was, and how it was a psychological warfare operation,
[21:38.280 --> 21:39.280]  now declassified and admitted.
[21:39.280 --> 21:46.280]  In fact, before he comes on third hour, you guys print me one in Telegraph, Toronto, Star,
[21:46.280 --> 21:53.280]  the, all the news articles may admit that the militaries under command of the big pharma
[21:53.280 --> 21:58.280]  ran, quote, brainwashing and fear campaigns to scare the public in the lockdowns and taking
[21:58.280 --> 21:59.280]  the deadly shots.
[21:59.280 --> 22:03.280]  Because it's not debatable it was a scythe, it's not debatable it was a lie, it's not
[22:03.280 --> 22:06.280]  debatable it was a fraud, we had them.
[22:06.280 --> 22:12.280]  And the good news is, the rats are leaving the sinking ship.
[22:12.280 --> 22:18.280]  Ethically unjustifiable, top scientists from Harvard and John Hopkins go public with a
[22:18.280 --> 22:32.280]  major study, COVID-19 shots 98 times, worse than the virus.
[22:32.280 --> 22:38.280]  And they knew it and they did it, it was in the CDC documents October 2020 and they hit
[22:38.280 --> 22:39.280]  us.
[22:39.280 --> 22:44.280]  And you think that's the end of this, you're crazy, they're just getting started.
[22:44.280 --> 22:47.280]  So you've got two choices or three really.
[22:47.280 --> 22:50.280]  You can try to, if you've got the money run to the middle of nowhere and hide out and try
[22:50.280 --> 22:54.280]  to wake this out, and if we don't have you on the team on the battlefield, the enemy's
[22:54.280 --> 22:55.280]  probably going to win.
[22:55.280 --> 22:59.280]  Or you can join us and expose these people and fight back politically, economically,
[22:59.280 --> 23:01.280]  culturally, spiritually at every level.
[23:01.280 --> 23:06.280]  Or you can join with them and try to get a job with the New World Order and promise you'll
[23:06.280 --> 23:11.280]  do horrible things and serve them for a while knowing you'll get destroyed in the end.
[23:11.280 --> 23:16.280]  Or I guess there's a fourth thing you could do, you just keep being mindless idiots and
[23:16.280 --> 23:22.280]  just bumble around ignoring what's happening and party a little bit longer until the food
[23:22.280 --> 23:25.280]  and water and energy runs out, which isn't much longer.
[23:25.280 --> 23:27.280]  In fact, it's already here in most of the world.
[23:27.280 --> 23:31.280]  And what's happening in Deutschland and what's happening in France and the Netherlands and
[23:31.280 --> 23:36.280]  Italy and the United States is next.
[23:36.280 --> 23:37.280]  It's already happening in many areas of the United States.
[23:37.280 --> 23:39.280]  The energy is being cut off.
[23:39.280 --> 23:40.280]  That's coming up next segment.
[23:40.280 --> 23:41.280]  It's here.
[23:41.280 --> 23:42.280]  It's going on.
[23:42.280 --> 23:43.280]  It's now.
[23:43.280 --> 23:46.280]  And they've got the solution, a universal basic income that tracks everything you do with
[23:46.280 --> 23:50.280]  a cell phone in live time and tells you what you can buy, what you can sell, where you
[23:50.280 --> 23:53.280]  can go, and how to wipe your ass.
[23:53.280 --> 23:54.280]  Ain't coming.
[23:54.280 --> 23:55.280]  It's here.
[23:55.280 --> 24:03.280]  Everything we told you about is here, is now, and the enemy is in full panic mode because
[24:03.280 --> 24:08.280]  whether it's the opposition in Italy or the opposition to the New World Order in Brazil
[24:08.280 --> 24:13.280]  or the opposition to the globalist in Mexico or Canada or the U.S. or the U.K.
[24:13.280 --> 24:19.280]  Baby, you know what flags flying at the head of the human resistance and it is this
[24:19.280 --> 24:23.280]  operation, ladies and gentlemen.
[24:23.280 --> 24:28.280]  London Telegraph, state of fear, how ministers use covert tactics to keep scared public at
[24:28.280 --> 24:33.280]  home using military psychological warfare, illegal previously to be used against domestic
[24:33.280 --> 24:34.280]  populations.
[24:34.280 --> 24:41.280]  To keep waiting for the military to come save you, the military at the top is controlled
[24:41.280 --> 24:43.280]  by the globalists in using it against you.
[24:43.280 --> 24:48.280]  Yes, are there a lot of people that worked in psychological operations that have overthrown
[24:48.280 --> 24:52.280]  governments and run major operations that are fighting the globalists?
[24:52.280 --> 24:53.280]  Standard choices.
[24:53.280 --> 24:56.280]  And they're fighting with us.
[24:56.280 --> 24:57.280]  We are the American resistance.
[24:57.280 --> 24:58.280]  We are the human resistance.
[24:58.280 --> 25:00.280]  This is it.
[25:00.280 --> 25:03.280]  And I don't say it again with some arrogant pleasure.
[25:03.280 --> 25:08.280]  I say it to recognize what you as listeners have backed and your commissioning of this
[25:08.280 --> 25:09.280]  operation.
[25:09.280 --> 25:10.280]  This is the tip of the spear.
[25:10.280 --> 25:12.280]  This is the platinum standard.
[25:12.280 --> 25:14.280]  This is it right here.
[25:14.280 --> 25:16.280]  And don't think I don't know that.
[25:16.280 --> 25:19.280]  And don't think it isn't a giant weight on me.
[25:19.280 --> 25:27.280]  So, if you can temporize and actually let it get into your mind and understand that obviously,
[25:27.280 --> 25:30.280]  of course, America is the main resistance as bad as we are.
[25:30.280 --> 25:34.280]  And of course, the main resistance in America is coming out of a place like Texas.
[25:34.280 --> 25:36.280]  That's the way the world's been.
[25:36.280 --> 25:38.280]  It's the way the world still is.
[25:38.280 --> 25:40.280]  As Texas goes, America goes.
[25:40.280 --> 25:42.280]  As America goes, so goes the world.
[25:42.280 --> 25:44.280]  You know who said that?
[25:44.280 --> 25:48.280]  Dwight D. Eisenhower, when he was first elected president in the 1950s.
[25:48.280 --> 25:50.280]  1952.
[25:50.280 --> 25:52.280]  Look it up.
[25:52.280 --> 25:53.280]  Dwight D. Eisenhower.
[25:53.280 --> 25:55.280]  As Texas goes, America goes.
[25:55.280 --> 25:57.280]  As America goes, so the world.
[25:57.280 --> 26:00.280]  That's why the enemies pouring their people in trying to take over right here.
[26:00.280 --> 26:05.280]  And I'm right in the center of the enemy takeover, battling them at point blank range with everything I've got.
[26:05.280 --> 26:09.280]  God put us here in this fight.
[26:09.280 --> 26:11.280]  Woo!
[26:11.280 --> 26:13.280]  And then we've got D.H.F.
[26:13.280 --> 26:18.280]  Chief says biggest terror threat in America is radicalized online narratives of right wingers.
[26:18.280 --> 26:20.280]  They're coming for everybody.
[26:20.280 --> 26:25.280]  But we already know that they're coming for the children to chop their testicles off.
[26:25.280 --> 26:27.280]  This is full bone political purge.
[26:27.280 --> 26:31.280]  Tucker Carlson obtains DOJ subpoenas targeting Trump allies.
[26:31.280 --> 26:34.280]  DOJ seizes phones of two top Trump advisors.
[26:34.280 --> 26:38.280]  40 subpoenas issued in ongoing harassment campaign.
[26:38.280 --> 26:41.280]  No delay for Trump organization criminal tax trial.
[26:41.280 --> 26:44.280]  Just department seizes phones of top Trump aides.
[26:44.280 --> 26:48.280]  Trump packed faces scrutiny amid intensifying legal problems.
[26:48.280 --> 26:50.280]  On and on and on.
[26:50.280 --> 26:52.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, but what do you expect?
[26:52.280 --> 26:54.280]  This is a war.
[26:54.280 --> 26:55.280]  It's asymmetrical.
[26:55.280 --> 26:57.280]  It's fifth generation.
[26:57.280 --> 26:58.280]  And it's against the people.
[26:58.280 --> 27:00.280]  It's against the infrastructure.
[27:00.280 --> 27:02.280]  It's called the great reset.
[27:02.280 --> 27:10.280]  And then when they enslave you and cut all your resources sources off and reprogram you, it's called build back better.
[27:10.280 --> 27:17.280]  And if you know that enemy and if you know what it is and if you're aware with it, it's game over if we're aware of it.
[27:17.280 --> 27:22.280]  And that's why they want to software because we can cover all the side issues.
[27:22.280 --> 27:23.280]  We can cover all the interesting news.
[27:23.280 --> 27:24.280]  That's all important.
[27:24.280 --> 27:25.280]  That's all entertaining.
[27:25.280 --> 27:28.280]  And yeah, yeah, yeah, but we're not a regular radio show or TV show.
[27:28.280 --> 27:30.280]  We're about warning you about what's happening.
[27:30.280 --> 27:39.280]  Show you what the enemy's saying and then believing in you and betting on you to mobilize against the globalist.
[27:39.280 --> 27:41.280]  Then we've got the news in Russia.
[27:41.280 --> 27:44.280]  I said it back in October.
[27:44.280 --> 27:47.280]  I said Russia's going to invade and I thought China would invade Taiwan.
[27:47.280 --> 27:49.280]  They were planning to, but you know, they backed off.
[27:49.280 --> 27:52.280]  But the word was they were going to go in in October.
[27:52.280 --> 27:59.280]  We had the information in October that the Chinese would move in in late February into Taiwan.
[27:59.280 --> 28:05.280]  The Russians would move into Ukraine because NATO had started a war and was pushing it.
[28:05.280 --> 28:11.280]  And I said at the time to all these Russophiles who hate the new world order so they think Russia's perfect,
[28:11.280 --> 28:20.280]  that Putin's walking into a trap and that the entire globalist NATO CIA commando force is waiting for them in a trap.
[28:20.280 --> 28:31.280]  Just like Hitler went into Russia in 1943 with Operation Barbarossa to absolutely suck Russia in
[28:31.280 --> 28:36.280]  and then start wars in the other satellites of Russia, which is now happening.
[28:36.280 --> 28:39.280]  So it's on, folks, which is incredibly dangerous.
[28:39.280 --> 28:42.280]  Oh, yeah, Ukraine's winning. Russia's just going to escalate now.
[28:42.280 --> 28:44.280]  And then the West is going to escalate.
[28:44.280 --> 28:50.280]  That's what I'm saying. This is apocalyptic type stuff.
[28:50.280 --> 28:53.280]  And you know the new world order is planning false flags 56 days out from the election.
[28:53.280 --> 28:55.280]  We're entering the false flag zone right now.
[28:55.280 --> 28:59.280]  We'll cover false flags when we come back, stay with us.
[28:59.280 --> 29:08.280]  The rage for more than a decade have been concentrated green powders with wheatgrass and so many other ingredients

[29:14.280 --> 29:21.280]  Now over a year and a half ago, we came out with a product that was top sourced, top of the line, as good as it's going to get.
[29:21.280 --> 29:25.280]  But then the supply chain broke down and it was sold out for more than a year.

[30:08.280 --> 30:16.280]  But what I don't see being promoted is the fact that it has natural psychotropic effects.
[30:16.280 --> 30:18.280]  It certainly does for me.
[30:18.280 --> 30:24.280]  If I take a couple of these capsules an hour before bed, my sleep, my dreams are amazing.

[31:29.280 --> 31:35.280]  And as a fundraiser, it is funding the information war against the globalist.
[31:35.280 --> 31:39.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, 10,000 coins are available. They'll sell out very quickly.
[31:39.280 --> 31:42.280]  Please be part of history and thank you all for your support.
[31:42.280 --> 31:49.280]  You can go to 1776coin.com or you can go to patreoncollectibles.com and secure this coin.
[31:49.280 --> 31:54.280]  There's only 10,000 of this coin in existence and it funds the info war.
[31:54.280 --> 32:20.280]  Man in the arena coin, Teddy Roosevelt, 1776coin.com.
[32:20.280 --> 32:24.280]  We told you this was a designed program by the globalist two and a half years ago.
[32:24.280 --> 32:28.280]  We told you energy and food prices would explode and now they're up more than 40% of the U.S. alone.
[32:28.280 --> 32:31.280]  Some areas of the world, they're up over 100%.
[32:31.280 --> 32:34.280]  The only way you beat inflation and protect yourself and your family is with high quality,
[32:34.280 --> 32:38.280]  trouble food ready to ship right now at preparetoday.com.
[32:38.280 --> 32:42.280]  At a very rare sale of 10% off site-wide.
[32:42.280 --> 32:46.280]  Not just on trouble food, but survival and preparedness items is happening right now.
[32:46.280 --> 32:52.280]  So go to preparetoday.com and on top of it, any order above $99 gets free shipping.
[32:52.280 --> 32:54.280]  That is a huge part of the cost of trouble food.
[32:54.280 --> 33:20.280]  So go to preparetoday.com and protect yourself and your family while you still can.
[33:20.280 --> 33:26.280]  Well, so does he live from the info wars.com studios.
[33:26.280 --> 33:36.280]  It's Alex Jones.
[33:36.280 --> 33:54.280]  It shocks the conscience of everyone who sees it.
[33:54.280 --> 33:58.280]  But the number of people who see it is very small because it is not covered by any media.
[33:58.280 --> 34:00.280]  And it's not just happening to Amy Kramer.
[34:00.280 --> 34:06.280]  This show has obtained a subpoena for America Owns DOJ issued in the past week.
[34:06.280 --> 34:10.280]  And what it demands is both unlawful and without precedent in American history.
[34:10.280 --> 34:16.280]  The subpoena claims to be investigating, quote, any claim that the vice president and or president of the senate
[34:16.280 --> 34:21.280]  had the authority to reject or choose not to count presidential electors.
[34:21.280 --> 34:27.280]  Now, keep in mind that any claim you make as an American citizen about electors,
[34:27.280 --> 34:31.280]  that American politics period is protected explicitly under the First Amendment.
[34:31.280 --> 34:32.280]  That's our core freedom.
[34:32.280 --> 34:33.280]  It's why we live here.
[34:33.280 --> 34:34.280]  It's why we're proud to be Americans.
[34:34.280 --> 34:38.280]  It's why so many American servicemen died protecting our country.
[34:38.280 --> 34:41.280]  Those are the freedoms that they fought to preserve.
[34:41.280 --> 34:49.280]  That's why nobody prosecuted leading Democrats in 2016 when they sought to reject electors for Donald Trump.
[34:49.280 --> 34:50.280]  Right.
[34:50.280 --> 34:53.280]  It's why none of those people, including Kamala Harris, is now in jail.
[34:53.280 --> 34:59.280]  But right now, according to the subpoena that we have obtained, Merrick Garland's DOJ is demanding all communication
[34:59.280 --> 35:01.280]  from the following people on this topic.
[35:01.280 --> 35:06.280]  And let's be clear before we read their names that it is not clear what the investigation is actually about.
[35:06.280 --> 35:08.280]  And that's the most terrifying part.
[35:08.280 --> 35:09.280]  What is this?
[35:09.280 --> 35:13.280]  What grounds are you demanding my private communications with people?
[35:13.280 --> 35:14.280]  They never say.
[35:14.280 --> 35:23.280]  But included in this precedent-breaking sweep of political opponents of the Biden White House would be
[35:23.280 --> 35:27.280]  former White House adviser Bernie Karak, who is the former police commissioner of New York City.
[35:27.280 --> 35:31.280]  Boris Efschein, who is the current attorney for Donald Trump.
[35:31.280 --> 35:37.280]  At no time in American history has it been okay to grab the personal communications of someone's lawyer,
[35:37.280 --> 35:40.280]  because those are privileged, not anymore.
[35:40.280 --> 35:45.280]  Matt Morgan, Justin Clark, Kenneth Chesborough, Mike Roman, RNC official Joshua Finley,
[35:45.280 --> 35:51.280]  Trump attorneys John Eastman, Jenna Ellis, Joe DeGeneva, James Trupas, Rudy Giuliani.
[35:51.280 --> 35:55.280]  The DOJ is now going after from a White House official, Stephen Miller,
[35:55.280 --> 35:57.280]  frequent guest on this show of the subpoena.
[35:57.280 --> 35:58.280]  Why?
[35:58.280 --> 36:02.280]  Well, it could be because Stephen Miller went on this network and said, quote,
[36:02.280 --> 36:08.280]  if we win these cases in the courts, then we can direct the alternate state of electors are certified.
[36:08.280 --> 36:14.280]  In other words, he didn't call for an insurrection, much less violence or a coup.
[36:14.280 --> 36:20.280]  He called for alternate electors to be seated if the court ordered them to be seated.
[36:20.280 --> 36:28.280]  In other words, he was following the constitutionally prescribed process post-election.
[36:28.280 --> 36:30.280]  He's doing what he's supposed to do.
[36:30.280 --> 36:32.280]  He was following the rules.
[36:32.280 --> 36:35.280]  But under Joe Biden, that apparently is now a crime.
[36:35.280 --> 36:39.280]  By the way, every one of these people has to hire lawyers to defend him or herself.
[36:39.280 --> 36:44.280]  And a lot of them at this point, after two years of harassment by Joe Biden, can't.
[36:44.280 --> 36:50.280]  And the last three times Republicans won, Democrats tried the same thing.
[36:50.280 --> 36:53.280]  So they know that America is broken with them.
[36:53.280 --> 36:55.280]  They know the public isn't buying their lives.
[36:55.280 --> 36:57.280]  They know they've committed all these crimes.
[36:57.280 --> 36:59.280]  And so they're starting a war with Russia.
[36:59.280 --> 37:02.280]  They are dissolving the border.
[37:02.280 --> 37:04.280]  They're going after political enemies.
[37:04.280 --> 37:08.280]  They are announcing their social credit score.
[37:08.280 --> 37:11.280]  All of it is happening right now.
[37:11.280 --> 37:13.280]  And you see this headline.
[37:13.280 --> 37:15.280]  DHF's chief, who leaves the border wide open, says,
[37:15.280 --> 37:21.280]  biggest terror threat is America's radicalized by online narratives.
[37:21.280 --> 37:26.280]  Not the tens of thousands of unvetted or hundreds of thousands of unvetted Afghans they brought in,
[37:26.280 --> 37:29.280]  many of which they admit are al-Qaeda.
[37:29.280 --> 37:35.280]  Not them, no, it's people protesting the election.
[37:35.280 --> 37:40.280]  Now, the writings on the wall, they had Senator Warner on TV just a few days ago
[37:40.280 --> 37:43.280]  saying Republicans are going to stage terror attacks.
[37:43.280 --> 37:46.280]  No evidence that Republicans are going to blow anything up.
[37:46.280 --> 37:48.280]  No evidence Republicans are going to shoot anybody.
[37:48.280 --> 37:51.280]  No evidence Republicans are going to engage any type of attacks.
[37:51.280 --> 37:53.280]  But they say it's imminent.
[37:53.280 --> 37:55.280]  Now, two plus two equals four.
[37:55.280 --> 37:57.280]  One plus one equals two.
[37:57.280 --> 37:59.280]  One is just the number one.
[37:59.280 --> 38:01.280]  You don't need to be able to add one plus one.
[38:01.280 --> 38:03.280]  You could be a three-year-old and say,
[38:03.280 --> 38:05.280]  what's this number on a flashcard?
[38:05.280 --> 38:08.280]  And the three-year-old says, that's a one.
[38:08.280 --> 38:10.280]  This isn't even two plus two.
[38:10.280 --> 38:14.280]  They are everywhere running on imminent terror attacks.
[38:14.280 --> 38:21.280]  They are everywhere running on that the Republicans are going to engage in terror.
[38:21.280 --> 38:23.280]  A week and a half ago, I went on air and I said,
[38:23.280 --> 38:26.280]  we need to be nonviolent, 100%, they're going to try to stage stuff.
[38:26.280 --> 38:28.280]  They're rolling this out.
[38:28.280 --> 38:31.280]  And they had a bunch of national news come out and say,
[38:31.280 --> 38:33.280]  Alex Jones calls for violence.
[38:33.280 --> 38:39.280]  They played a clip where I said the Democrats and the deep state are going to engage in violence.
[38:39.280 --> 38:44.280]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, they are completely weaponized.
[38:44.280 --> 38:46.280]  They're lying at levels I've never seen before.
[38:46.280 --> 38:48.280]  I'm not going to respond to it all.
[38:48.280 --> 38:52.280]  But the stuff they're attacking us with now is like 99% not even true.
[38:52.280 --> 38:55.280]  And you read this stuff, you know, where do they come up with this?
[38:55.280 --> 38:57.280]  Why do they not care?
[38:57.280 --> 39:00.280]  Because they've been given the green light and believe they're having an authoritarian takeover
[39:00.280 --> 39:06.280]  and so they don't care what they do because they believe they're protected judicially
[39:06.280 --> 39:09.280]  by the corrupt judiciary, by the corrupt justice department.
[39:09.280 --> 39:12.280]  And I guess they really are.
[39:12.280 --> 39:14.280]  And so that's where we are.
[39:14.280 --> 39:18.280]  Because these people will do anything at this point.
[39:18.280 --> 39:22.280]  We have a bureaucracy that sold us out to China and other third world countries
[39:22.280 --> 39:24.280]  that became fabulously rich doing it.
[39:24.280 --> 39:27.280]  That's now cutting off our energy, imploding our borders,
[39:27.280 --> 39:30.280]  shipping in fentanyl, drag queen pedophile time,
[39:30.280 --> 39:38.280]  coming after our gods, censoring us, spying on us, doing all of this
[39:38.280 --> 39:40.280]  because they know they've lost politically.
[39:40.280 --> 39:43.280]  And what do you do when you've lost politically?
[39:43.280 --> 39:45.280]  Why do so many third world countries go this way?
[39:45.280 --> 39:47.280]  Why have so many European nations gone this way?
[39:47.280 --> 39:51.280]  This is the norm in history where you have a group that's in power
[39:51.280 --> 39:55.280]  and doesn't want to relinquish power, that's stole election,
[39:55.280 --> 39:59.280]  that is ready, willing and able to do whatever it takes to stay in power
[39:59.280 --> 40:02.280]  because they feel insulated, they feel protected.
[40:02.280 --> 40:04.280]  And so I'm just here giving you the bad news.
[40:04.280 --> 40:06.280]  America has cancer.
[40:06.280 --> 40:07.280]  Europe has cancer.
[40:07.280 --> 40:08.280]  The world has cancer.
[40:08.280 --> 40:09.280]  It's called the New World Order.
[40:09.280 --> 40:10.280]  It's called transhumanism.
[40:10.280 --> 40:12.280]  It's called globalism.
[40:12.280 --> 40:15.280]  And they're not stopping one bit in this attack.
[40:15.280 --> 40:19.280]  And they are brutally shutting down the nuclear power plants,
[40:19.280 --> 40:21.280]  shutting down the coal power plants,
[40:21.280 --> 40:23.280]  shutting down even hydroelectric dams,
[40:23.280 --> 40:25.280]  shutting down the pipelines everywhere.
[40:25.280 --> 40:28.280]  They are deliberately shutting things down
[40:28.280 --> 40:31.280]  to create a crisis and riots and starvation
[40:31.280 --> 40:33.280]  that's already happening in the third world.
[40:33.280 --> 40:35.280]  So bad, they believe the public will say,
[40:35.280 --> 40:38.280]  just make it stop, we'll do whatever you want, okay?
[40:38.280 --> 40:42.280]  A debt jubilee.
[40:42.280 --> 40:46.280]  We're going to give you this new ID system
[40:46.280 --> 40:48.280]  and if you just do what we say and behave like we want,
[40:48.280 --> 40:50.280]  you'll get enough money to live.
[40:50.280 --> 40:52.280]  And once you take that,
[40:52.280 --> 40:54.280]  it's like Ursula and the Little Mermaid,
[40:54.280 --> 40:56.280]  once she gets that contract signed,
[40:56.280 --> 40:58.280]  boy, she's going to dance in a big circle
[40:58.280 --> 41:01.280]  and just love what she's done.
[41:01.280 --> 41:03.280]  It only gets worse submitting to these people.
[41:03.280 --> 41:05.280]  It only gets more horrible.
[41:05.280 --> 41:07.280]  So what do you do?
[41:07.280 --> 41:09.280]  You share articles and videos like your life depends on it
[41:09.280 --> 41:10.280]  because it does.
[41:10.280 --> 41:12.280]  And you pray for a global awakening.
[41:12.280 --> 41:16.280]  And you every day, call in to every talk show you can
[41:16.280 --> 41:19.280]  and you demonstrate and you protest
[41:19.280 --> 41:21.280]  and you support mom and pop operations
[41:21.280 --> 41:23.280]  and you just identify that the great reset
[41:23.280 --> 41:26.280]  and the globalist are the authors of our pain
[41:26.280 --> 41:28.280]  and of everything we're going through.
[41:28.280 --> 41:30.280]  That's what you do.
[41:30.280 --> 41:32.280]  Now I want to go through the economic shutdown.
[41:32.280 --> 41:34.280]  I've got like 30, 40 articles here.
[41:34.280 --> 41:36.280]  I'm a counter to them, it's a lot.
[41:36.280 --> 41:37.280]  Let me just see.
[41:37.280 --> 41:42.280]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
[41:42.280 --> 41:46.280]  eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen,
[41:46.280 --> 41:49.280]  seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two,
[41:49.280 --> 41:52.280]  twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven,
[41:52.280 --> 41:55.280]  twenty-eight, twenty-nine, twenty-nine articles.
[41:55.280 --> 41:56.280]  I said thirty or forty.
[41:56.280 --> 41:57.280]  I just, I'd reckoned it.
[41:57.280 --> 42:02.280]  Twenty-nine articles on how they are admittedly bragging
[42:02.280 --> 42:04.280]  how they're doing this.
[42:04.280 --> 42:06.280]  It's disgusting.
[42:06.280 --> 42:08.280]  They have Christian churches and Jewish synagogues
[42:08.280 --> 42:10.280]  under the World Council of Churches,
[42:10.280 --> 42:13.280]  Rockefeller Foundation, UN program, telling parishioners,
[42:13.280 --> 42:15.280]  get ready to have no food.
[42:15.280 --> 42:17.280]  It's of the Lord.
[42:17.280 --> 42:22.280]  You won't have food for Jesus, or you won't have food for Jehovah.
[42:22.280 --> 42:28.280]  I mean, this is full, total war.
[42:28.280 --> 42:31.280]  And everything we talked about for decades is now coming
[42:31.280 --> 42:35.280]  to a big, giant, stinking head.
[42:35.280 --> 42:38.280]  And if we reject the poison, they fail.
[42:38.280 --> 42:40.280]  If we let them pose as the saviors,
[42:40.280 --> 42:42.280]  whether they're the authors of the collapse,
[42:42.280 --> 42:44.280]  they're going to win big time.
[42:44.280 --> 42:46.280]  And then if you think you're in deep trouble now,
[42:46.280 --> 42:49.280]  you ain't seen nothing yet.
[42:49.280 --> 42:50.280]  Big news, what's coming up?
[42:50.280 --> 42:51.280]  I'll give the phone number out.
[42:51.280 --> 42:53.280]  Take your calls for the entire second hour.
[42:53.280 --> 42:55.280]  Then Dr. Peter Breggen, who's incredible,
[42:55.280 --> 42:57.280]  will be joining us in the third hour.
[42:57.280 --> 42:59.280]  Stay with us.
[42:59.280 --> 43:02.280]  The rage for more than a decade
[43:02.280 --> 43:05.280]  have been concentrated green powders
[43:05.280 --> 43:08.280]  with wheatgrass and so many other ingredients
[43:08.280 --> 43:10.280]  that are known to make us healthy,
[43:10.280 --> 43:14.280]  to make us vibrant, and to defend our immune systems.
[43:14.280 --> 43:16.280]  Now, over a year and a half ago,
[43:16.280 --> 43:18.280]  we came out with a product that was top sourced,
[43:18.280 --> 43:21.280]  top of the line, as good as it's going to get,
[43:21.280 --> 43:23.280]  but then the supply chain broke down
[43:23.280 --> 43:25.280]  and it was sold out for more than a year.
[43:25.280 --> 43:27.280]  Finally, green fiber capsules,
[43:27.280 --> 43:29.280]  this big old bottle, jam-packed,
[43:29.280 --> 43:32.280]  is back in stock for a limited time
[43:32.280 --> 43:35.280]  at infoworkstore.com, 30% off.
[43:35.280 --> 43:37.280]  And this limited time left time
[43:37.280 --> 43:39.280]  to go into all the great things it does
[43:39.280 --> 43:40.280]  or what it has inside.
[43:40.280 --> 43:42.280]  But go to infoworkstore.com
[43:42.280 --> 43:44.280]  and look up green fiber capsules for yourself
[43:44.280 --> 43:46.280]  and see how amazing it is.
[43:46.280 --> 43:48.280]  And what's just as amazing is,
[43:48.280 --> 43:50.280]  it funds the info war and keeps us on air.
[43:50.280 --> 43:52.280]  We're all under globalist attack.

[44:29.280 --> 44:32.280]  to change who we are
[44:32.280 --> 44:33.280]  are only lowering us.
[44:33.280 --> 44:34.280]  They're only making us more depressed.
[44:34.280 --> 44:37.280]  To the end, they're only making us less fulfilled.
[44:37.280 --> 44:39.280]  It is only by going within
[44:39.280 --> 44:40.280]  and really making that connection to God
[44:40.280 --> 44:42.280]  that we can truly empower ourselves.
[44:42.280 --> 44:44.280]  That's why the globe was bombarded
[44:44.280 --> 44:46.280]  with toxins and chemicals
[44:46.280 --> 44:48.280]  to block us getting the normal vitamins and minerals
[44:48.280 --> 44:51.280]  and trace elements our bodies need to be healthy
[44:51.280 --> 44:54.280]  and to be able to basically reach out
[44:54.280 --> 44:55.280]  beyond the third dimension.
[44:55.280 --> 44:57.280]  And that's where the incredible products come in
[44:57.280 --> 44:59.280]  at infoworkstore.com.
[44:59.280 --> 45:02.280]  Our world is so full of hype
[45:02.280 --> 45:05.280]  that you're force-fed dehumanizing propaganda
[45:05.280 --> 45:06.280]  by the corporate media,
[45:06.280 --> 45:09.280]  by the controlled churches and the universities.
[45:09.280 --> 45:11.280]  And why is this the case?
[45:11.280 --> 45:13.280]  Because we innately, by God,
[45:13.280 --> 45:15.280]  have been given the keys for our own minds,
[45:15.280 --> 45:17.280]  our own psyches, our own souls.
[45:17.280 --> 45:19.280]  And by connecting to God,
[45:19.280 --> 45:20.280]  we can empower ourselves
[45:20.280 --> 45:23.280]  and transcend the quote,
[45:23.280 --> 45:25.280]  the world is all in our sinful state.
[45:25.280 --> 45:27.280]  So the chemicals that we ingest
[45:27.280 --> 45:29.280]  and all the things we've got to bring into our bodies
[45:29.280 --> 45:31.280]  to change who we are
[45:31.280 --> 45:33.280]  are only lowering us.
[45:33.280 --> 45:35.280]  They're only making us more depressed.
[45:35.280 --> 45:37.280]  To the end, they're only making us less filled.
[45:37.280 --> 45:39.280]  It is only by going within
[45:39.280 --> 45:41.280]  and really making that connection to God
[45:41.280 --> 45:43.280]  that we can truly empower ourselves.
[45:43.280 --> 45:45.280]  That's why the globe was bombarded with toxins and chemicals
[45:45.280 --> 45:48.280]  to block us getting the normal vitamins and minerals
[45:48.280 --> 45:51.280]  and trace elements our bodies need to be healthy

[46:59.280 --> 47:17.280]  and see what you can do.
[47:17.280 --> 47:19.280]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:19.280 --> 47:21.280]  So, in the year 2022,
[47:21.280 --> 47:23.280]  we saw the puppet,
[47:23.280 --> 47:25.280]  unelected president
[47:25.280 --> 47:27.280]  who goes to the same town last week,
[47:27.280 --> 47:29.280]  Biden gets 100
[47:29.280 --> 47:31.280]  and we're told this guy that can't even talk
[47:31.280 --> 47:33.280]  actually got elected, we're told you're not allowed to question
[47:33.280 --> 47:35.280]  what happened despite all the proof of fraud,
[47:35.280 --> 47:37.280]  we're told we're terrorists if we ask questions
[47:37.280 --> 47:39.280]  and we're told by the Justice Department
[47:39.280 --> 47:41.280]  and DHS that
[47:41.280 --> 47:43.280]  the number one threat is the American people.
[47:43.280 --> 47:45.280]  That's Venezuela, that's Cuba,
[47:45.280 --> 47:47.280]  that's North Korea, it's really
[47:47.280 --> 47:49.280]  happening.
[47:49.280 --> 47:51.280]  And it is so overwhelming
[47:51.280 --> 47:53.280]  to know this is coming, to have known this was going to unfold
[47:53.280 --> 47:55.280]  for decades
[47:55.280 --> 47:57.280]  and to now be in the middle of it
[47:57.280 --> 47:59.280]  and see folks starting to wake up
[47:59.280 --> 48:01.280]  but not quick enough.
[48:01.280 --> 48:03.280]  Of course, my book
[48:03.280 --> 48:05.280]  predicting and exposing all this
[48:05.280 --> 48:07.280]  should be number one in the world.
[48:07.280 --> 48:09.280]  The Great Reset and it is.
[48:09.280 --> 48:11.280]  And of course the New York Times blocked that
[48:11.280 --> 48:13.280]  because freedom is popular and if we just push
[48:13.280 --> 48:15.280]  a few more degrees into the enemy,
[48:17.280 --> 48:19.280]  if we just swing for the fences
[48:19.280 --> 48:21.280]  they will go down.
[48:21.280 --> 48:23.280]  This huge attempted power grab
[48:23.280 --> 48:25.280]  will blow up in their face.
[48:25.280 --> 48:27.280]  But instead
[48:27.280 --> 48:29.280]  they're cutting off the resources and saying
[48:29.280 --> 48:31.280]  oh we're so sorry, we've got a universal
[48:31.280 --> 48:33.280]  basic income and a system to track
[48:33.280 --> 48:35.280]  you now and you'll all be on welfare
[48:35.280 --> 48:37.280]  and let's look at these
[48:37.280 --> 48:39.280]  headlines, they speak for themselves.
[48:39.280 --> 48:41.280]  Germany's power grid faces
[48:41.280 --> 48:43.280]  collapses millions stock up on
[48:43.280 --> 48:45.280]  inefficient electric heaters
[48:45.280 --> 48:47.280]  for the winter.
[48:47.280 --> 48:49.280]  They cut off all the nuclear power plants,
[48:49.280 --> 48:51.280]  they cut off the coal plants, then
[48:51.280 --> 48:53.280]  they put sanctions on Russia
[48:53.280 --> 48:55.280]  and cut off the major
[48:55.280 --> 48:57.280]  pipeline and then blame Russia.
[48:57.280 --> 48:59.280]  I blame Russia all day there at fault, they're not.
[48:59.280 --> 49:01.280]  Freeze
[49:01.280 --> 49:03.280]  for global agenda.
[49:03.280 --> 49:05.280]  Big Breitbart article.

[49:07.280 --> 49:09.280]  do not return to fossil fuels over
[49:09.280 --> 49:11.280]  energy crisis.
[49:11.280 --> 49:13.280]  Well they're all filthy rich.
[49:13.280 --> 49:15.280]  Energy crisis, one in four Britons will not
[49:15.280 --> 49:17.280]  turn on heating over the winter months.
[49:17.280 --> 49:19.280]  Energy crisis, homes left without
[49:19.280 --> 49:21.280]  heating will kill

[49:25.280 --> 49:27.280]  on fuel, poverty, cold homes
[49:27.280 --> 49:29.280]  and healthy
[49:29.280 --> 49:31.280]  health inequities in the UK. Their answer
[49:31.280 --> 49:33.280]  a social credit score.
[49:33.280 --> 49:35.280]  Energy bills can be up to
[49:35.280 --> 49:37.280]  to see up to six in ten
[49:37.280 --> 49:39.280]  listen to this, energy bills
[49:39.280 --> 49:41.280]  can see up to six in ten
[49:41.280 --> 49:43.280]  UK factories forced
[49:43.280 --> 49:45.280]  to close. They are collapsing
[49:45.280 --> 49:47.280]  civilization.
[49:47.280 --> 49:49.280]  Breaking.
[49:49.280 --> 49:51.280]  Consumer price index is up
[49:51.280 --> 49:53.280]  8.3%
[49:53.280 --> 49:55.280]  higher than economists expected. How will the
[49:55.280 --> 49:57.280]  media spin this in Biden's favor
[49:57.280 --> 49:59.280]  showing massive inflation
[49:59.280 --> 50:01.280]  increase in shelter food
[50:01.280 --> 50:03.280]  medical care indexes were the
[50:03.280 --> 50:05.280]  largest of many contributors
[50:05.280 --> 50:07.280]  to the broad base monthly and all
[50:07.280 --> 50:09.280]  items increase because
[50:09.280 --> 50:11.280]  not this currency evaluation but cutting
[50:11.280 --> 50:13.280]  off manufacturing. These increases were
[50:13.280 --> 50:15.280]  mostly offset by the 10.6 deadline
[50:15.280 --> 50:17.280]  the gasoline tax
[50:17.280 --> 50:19.280]  the food index continues to rise

[50:33.280 --> 50:35.280]  I cry at this little meme
[50:35.280 --> 50:37.280]  it's got a little uh
[50:37.280 --> 50:39.280]  your breath
[50:39.280 --> 50:41.280]  smells like dog food character from The Simpsons
[50:41.280 --> 50:43.280]  saying the TV told
[50:43.280 --> 50:45.280]  me that if I eat bugs

[51:19.280 --> 51:21.280]  and it just goes on from there
[51:23.280 --> 51:25.280]  now let's look at what this is really all about
[51:25.280 --> 51:27.280]  if they want you to accept a universal basic income
[51:27.280 --> 51:29.280]  there's going to be a carbon tax digitally attached

[51:39.280 --> 51:41.280]  UK government's
[51:41.280 --> 51:43.280]  strategy
[51:43.280 --> 51:45.280]  for personal carbon rations but you got to first
[51:45.280 --> 51:47.280]  just cut it off then make you accept
[51:47.280 --> 51:49.280]  the rations to get a little bit
[51:49.280 --> 51:51.280]  personal carbon

[53:17.280 --> 53:19.280]  and overthrew the elected government
[53:19.280 --> 53:21.280]  and started this war
[53:21.280 --> 53:23.280]  now the Russians
[53:23.280 --> 53:25.280]  went into a trap
[53:25.280 --> 53:27.280]  and now they're going to escalate
[53:27.280 --> 53:29.280]  Ukraine's
[53:29.280 --> 53:31.280]  are certain of victory in international
[53:31.280 --> 53:33.280]  national poll
[53:33.280 --> 53:35.280]  the vast majority
[53:35.280 --> 53:37.280]  97% believe they're
[53:37.280 --> 53:39.280]  assured of total victory
[53:39.280 --> 53:41.280]  but the whole world goes down in the process
[53:41.280 --> 53:43.280]  Davos group pushes vaccine
[53:43.280 --> 53:45.280]  passports to enforce global carbon taxes
[53:45.280 --> 53:47.280]  it just goes on from there ladies and gentlemen
[53:49.280 --> 53:51.280]  it just goes on from there
[53:51.280 --> 53:53.280]  and then we've got little jewels like this
[53:53.280 --> 53:55.280]  look at this
[53:55.280 --> 53:57.280]  LA Times headline a six
[53:57.280 --> 53:59.280]  member jury with several
[53:59.280 --> 54:01.280]  alternatives will begin hearing evidence
[54:01.280 --> 54:03.280]  today on how much
[54:03.280 --> 54:05.280]  Alex Jones should pay the families
[54:05.280 --> 54:07.280]  of Sandy Hook since he already
[54:07.280 --> 54:09.280]  has been found liable for damages them
[54:09.280 --> 54:11.280]  the trial is expected to last four
[54:11.280 --> 54:13.280]  weeks
[54:13.280 --> 54:15.280]  now imagine
[54:15.280 --> 54:17.280]  why is a jury deciding
[54:17.280 --> 54:19.280]  how guilty I am why is a jury
[54:19.280 --> 54:21.280]  being told I'm guilty because this is the new
[54:21.280 --> 54:23.280]  weaponization they admit I'm the beta test
[54:23.280 --> 54:25.280]  like I was four years ago with
[54:25.280 --> 54:27.280]  deplatforming where the judges just
[54:27.280 --> 54:29.280]  say you didn't give them discovery find
[54:29.280 --> 54:31.280]  you in default even though it's not true use
[54:31.280 --> 54:33.280]  all the discovery against you twist it
[54:33.280 --> 54:35.280]  and then say you're already
[54:35.280 --> 54:37.280]  guilty to a jury and they tell the jury
[54:37.280 --> 54:39.280]  they're guilty and the jury believed
[54:39.280 --> 54:41.280]  it in the last show trial a month ago
[54:41.280 --> 54:43.280]  in Austin
[54:43.280 --> 54:45.280]  they're coming for everybody ladies and gentlemen
[54:45.280 --> 54:47.280]  Alex Jones goes to trial
[54:47.280 --> 54:49.280]  for second time in Sandy Hook hoax case
[54:49.280 --> 54:51.280]  look at this AP news
[54:51.280 --> 54:53.280]  trial set to begin for Alex Jones
[54:53.280 --> 54:55.280]  in Sandy Hook case a six member
[54:55.280 --> 54:57.280]  jury with several alternates in Connecticut
[54:57.280 --> 54:59.280]  will begin hearing evidence today
[54:59.280 --> 55:01.280]  on how Jones should pay the families
[55:01.280 --> 55:03.280]  since he already has been found liable
[55:03.280 --> 55:05.280]  for damages the trial is expected
[55:05.280 --> 55:07.280]  last four weeks they don't
[55:07.280 --> 55:09.280]  tell you in the article
[55:09.280 --> 55:11.280]  who found me guilty
[55:11.280 --> 55:13.280]  it wasn't a jury it was
[55:13.280 --> 55:15.280]  a judge
[55:15.280 --> 55:17.280]  people ask me how are you handling this
[55:17.280 --> 55:19.280]  I mean they're coming for everybody how am I handling it
[55:19.280 --> 55:21.280]  we're in a war this is total
[55:21.280 --> 55:23.280]  tyranny and I'll tell you this

[55:33.280 --> 55:35.280]  to fight three lawsuits in Texas
[55:35.280 --> 55:37.280]  and Connecticut
[55:37.280 --> 55:39.280]  and to fight any platforming

[59:57.280 --> 59:59.280]  and it's time for humanity to stand up
[59:59.280 --> 1:00:01.280]  in the info war
[1:00:01.280 --> 1:00:03.280]  and say I don't know what's going to
[1:00:03.280 --> 1:00:05.280]  happen at the end of this
[1:00:05.280 --> 1:00:07.280]  but you want to fight you better believe
[1:00:07.280 --> 1:00:09.280]  you got one
[1:00:09.280 --> 1:00:11.280]  from the front lines
[1:00:11.280 --> 1:00:13.280]  of the information war
[1:00:13.280 --> 1:00:27.280]  it's Alex Jones
[1:00:39.280 --> 1:00:41.280]  you know we have to get conspiratorial
[1:00:41.280 --> 1:00:43.280]  and we look at the iran contra
[1:00:43.280 --> 1:00:45.280]  the CIA was trade drugs with
[1:00:45.280 --> 1:00:47.280]  nicaraguans for guns we were giving them guns
[1:00:47.280 --> 1:00:49.280]  and then they were taking that cocaine
[1:00:49.280 --> 1:00:51.280]  and they were flying into minna arkansas
[1:00:51.280 --> 1:00:53.280]  which bill clennon happened to be the governor of that state
[1:00:53.280 --> 1:00:55.280]  and they were taking those drugs and they were putting them in florida
[1:00:55.280 --> 1:00:57.280]  they were putting in california freeway ricky ross
[1:00:57.280 --> 1:00:59.280]  so they created the crack epidemic so the people
[1:00:59.280 --> 1:01:01.280]  the same people that did that
[1:01:01.280 --> 1:01:03.280]  they're creating the problems that we have today
[1:01:03.280 --> 1:01:05.280]  so it's just a new drug for a new era
[1:01:05.280 --> 1:01:07.280]  I mean I grew up in a world where
[1:01:07.280 --> 1:01:09.280]  and speaking for myself I actually believe
[1:01:09.280 --> 1:01:11.280]  that conspiracy theories were
[1:01:11.280 --> 1:01:13.280]  the way that dumb
[1:01:13.280 --> 1:01:15.280]  uninformed people explained the complex world
[1:01:15.280 --> 1:01:17.280]  you couldn't understand what was actually happening
[1:01:17.280 --> 1:01:19.280]  you resorted to a conspiracy theory
[1:01:19.280 --> 1:01:21.280]  and that was a mark of
[1:01:21.280 --> 1:01:23.280]  a low IQ of course
[1:01:23.280 --> 1:01:25.280]  I'm here to warn people you keep telling me to shut up
[1:01:25.280 --> 1:01:27.280]  this isn't a game
[1:01:27.280 --> 1:01:29.280]  now I always think this
[1:01:29.280 --> 1:01:31.280]  the more informed the smarter
[1:01:31.280 --> 1:01:33.280]  the person the more likely they are
[1:01:33.280 --> 1:01:35.280]  to be connecting the dots that you're connecting
[1:01:35.280 --> 1:01:37.280]  so you grew up in a world where people just assumed
[1:01:37.280 --> 1:01:39.280]  that the system was not on the level
[1:01:39.280 --> 1:01:41.280]  I think
[1:01:41.280 --> 1:01:43.280]  well it's called cognitive dissonance
[1:01:43.280 --> 1:01:45.280]  it's like you know the government has done corrupt stuff
[1:01:45.280 --> 1:01:47.280]  you know there's classified levels of intelligence
[1:01:47.280 --> 1:01:49.280]  that you'll never be a part of
[1:01:49.280 --> 1:01:51.280]  but you have cognitive dissonance thinking that the government has your back
[1:01:51.280 --> 1:01:53.280]  they don't
[1:01:53.280 --> 1:01:55.280]  it's a personal people control system
[1:01:55.280 --> 1:01:57.280]  they want you to control us
[1:01:57.280 --> 1:01:59.280]  and that's one of the biggest parts of why they want to keep you depressed
[1:01:59.280 --> 1:02:01.280]  because tucker when you're constantly depressed
[1:02:01.280 --> 1:02:03.280]  you're in what is called fight or flight
[1:02:03.280 --> 1:02:05.280]  so your hormone response is constant cortisol
[1:02:05.280 --> 1:02:07.280]  and that's why Brian Stelter those guys
[1:02:07.280 --> 1:02:09.280]  that constantly have the ticker on CNN
[1:02:09.280 --> 1:02:11.280]  how many people die, how many people die
[1:02:11.280 --> 1:02:13.280]  because people get addicted to that hormone response
[1:02:13.280 --> 1:02:15.280]  and once you're in that fear state of fight or flight
[1:02:15.280 --> 1:02:17.280]  you can't see the force for the tree right in front of your face
[1:02:17.280 --> 1:02:19.280]  so then they can literally like a dog with a treat
[1:02:19.280 --> 1:02:21.280]  they can make you do whatever you want
[1:02:21.280 --> 1:02:23.280]  and that treat is just more trauma
[1:02:23.280 --> 1:02:25.280]  what I call trauma-based mind control
[1:02:25.280 --> 1:02:27.280]  just more fear tactics in order to control you
[1:02:27.280 --> 1:02:29.280]  so that's what's happening now is the mainstream media
[1:02:29.280 --> 1:02:31.280]  uses fear to control us
[1:02:31.280 --> 1:02:33.280]  and that's the same mechanism that the government uses
[1:02:33.280 --> 1:02:35.280]  but it doesn't agree more
[1:02:43.280 --> 1:02:45.280]  it's never going to get any better
[1:02:45.280 --> 1:02:47.280]  don't look for it, be happy with what you got
[1:02:49.280 --> 1:02:51.280]  because the owners of this country don't want that
[1:02:51.280 --> 1:02:53.280]  I'm talking about the real owners now
[1:02:53.280 --> 1:02:55.280]  the real owners
[1:02:55.280 --> 1:02:57.280]  the big wealthy business
[1:02:57.280 --> 1:02:59.280]  that control things and make all the important decisions
[1:02:59.280 --> 1:03:01.280]  forget the politicians
[1:03:01.280 --> 1:03:03.280]  the politicians are put there to give you the idea
[1:03:03.280 --> 1:03:05.280]  that you have freedom of choice
[1:03:05.280 --> 1:03:07.280]  you don't
[1:03:07.280 --> 1:03:09.280]  you have no choice
[1:03:09.280 --> 1:03:11.280]  you have owners, they own you
[1:03:11.280 --> 1:03:13.280]  they own everything
[1:03:13.280 --> 1:03:15.280]  they own all the important land
[1:03:15.280 --> 1:03:17.280]  they own and control the corporations
[1:03:17.280 --> 1:03:19.280]  they've long since bought and paid for the senate
[1:03:19.280 --> 1:03:21.280]  the congress, the state houses, the city halls
[1:03:21.280 --> 1:03:23.280]  they got the judges in their back pockets
[1:03:23.280 --> 1:03:25.280]  and they own all the big media companies
[1:03:25.280 --> 1:03:27.280]  so they control just about all of the news and information
[1:03:27.280 --> 1:03:29.280]  you get to hear
[1:03:29.280 --> 1:03:31.280]  they've had the balls
[1:03:31.280 --> 1:03:33.280]  they want obedient workers
[1:03:33.280 --> 1:03:35.280]  obedient workers
[1:03:35.280 --> 1:03:37.280]  people who are just smart enough
[1:03:37.280 --> 1:03:39.280]  to run the machines and do the paperwork
[1:03:39.280 --> 1:03:41.280]  and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs
[1:03:41.280 --> 1:03:43.280]  with the lower pay, the longer hours
[1:03:43.280 --> 1:03:45.280]  the reduced benefits, the end of overtime
[1:03:45.280 --> 1:03:47.280]  and the vanishing pension that disappears
[1:03:47.280 --> 1:03:49.280]  the minute you go to collect it
[1:03:49.280 --> 1:03:51.280]  and now they're coming for your social security money
[1:03:51.280 --> 1:03:53.280]  so they can give it to their criminal friends
[1:03:53.280 --> 1:03:55.280]  on wall street
[1:03:55.280 --> 1:03:57.280]  it's a big club
[1:03:57.280 --> 1:03:59.280]  and you ain't in it
[1:03:59.280 --> 1:04:01.280]  you said recently
[1:04:01.280 --> 1:04:03.280]  when you give
[1:04:03.280 --> 1:04:05.280]  they do whatever the hell you want them to do
[1:04:05.280 --> 1:04:07.280]  you better believe it
[1:04:07.280 --> 1:04:09.280]  so what specifically did they do
[1:04:09.280 --> 1:04:11.280]  if I ask them, if I need them
[1:04:11.280 --> 1:04:13.280]  most of the people on this stage I've given to
[1:04:13.280 --> 1:04:15.280]  just so you understand, a lot of money
[1:04:15.280 --> 1:04:17.280]  you and I are not in the big club
[1:04:17.280 --> 1:04:19.280]  the owners of this country
[1:04:19.280 --> 1:04:21.280]  know the truth
[1:04:21.280 --> 1:04:23.280]  it's called the American dream
[1:04:23.280 --> 1:04:25.280]  because you have to be asleep to believe it
[1:04:25.280 --> 1:04:27.280]  but I'll tell you what, they don't want
[1:04:27.280 --> 1:04:29.280]  they don't want a population
[1:04:29.280 --> 1:04:31.280]  of citizens capable of critical thinking
[1:04:31.280 --> 1:04:33.280]  they don't want well informed, well educated
[1:04:33.280 --> 1:04:35.280]  people capable of critical thinking
[1:04:35.280 --> 1:04:37.280]  they're not interested in that, that doesn't help them
[1:04:37.280 --> 1:04:39.280]  that's against their interest
[1:04:39.280 --> 1:04:41.280]  that's right
[1:04:41.280 --> 1:04:43.280]  from the front lines of the information war
[1:04:43.280 --> 1:04:45.280]  it's Alex Jones
[1:04:45.280 --> 1:04:47.280]  alright, tons of news
[1:04:47.280 --> 1:04:49.280]  I'll give the number out, your phone calls

[1:04:58.280 --> 1:04:59.280]  the rage
[1:04:59.280 --> 1:05:01.280]  for more than a decade

[1:05:03.280 --> 1:05:05.280]  powders with

[1:05:07.280 --> 1:05:09.280]  that are known to make us healthy
[1:05:09.280 --> 1:05:11.280]  to make us vibrant
[1:05:11.280 --> 1:05:13.280]  and to defend our immune systems

[1:05:17.280 --> 1:05:19.280]  top of the line
[1:05:19.280 --> 1:05:21.280]  as good as it's going to get
[1:05:21.280 --> 1:05:23.280]  the supply chain broke down
[1:05:23.280 --> 1:05:25.280]  and it was sold out for more than a year
[1:05:25.280 --> 1:05:27.280]  finally, green fiber capsules

[1:05:59.280 --> 1:06:25.280]  Music
[1:06:25.280 --> 1:06:27.280]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen
[1:06:27.280 --> 1:06:29.280]  so Eddie Bravo
[1:06:29.280 --> 1:06:31.280]  last night sent me a video
[1:06:31.280 --> 1:06:33.280]  and I watched it
[1:06:33.280 --> 1:06:35.280]  and then for about an hour
[1:06:35.280 --> 1:06:37.280]  after my wife only got one shot living with me
[1:06:37.280 --> 1:06:39.280]  now all the others have grown up
[1:06:39.280 --> 1:06:41.280]  I'm getting old
[1:06:41.280 --> 1:06:43.280]  after my five year old my wife had gone to sleep
[1:06:43.280 --> 1:06:45.280]  I spent an hour
[1:06:45.280 --> 1:06:47.280]  checking what this person had claimed
[1:06:47.280 --> 1:06:49.280]  and it was true
[1:06:49.280 --> 1:06:51.280]  now you can take from this what you want
[1:06:53.280 --> 1:06:55.280]  but not hundreds
[1:06:55.280 --> 1:06:57.280]  of thousands
[1:06:57.280 --> 1:06:59.280]  of country music acts
[1:06:59.280 --> 1:07:01.280]  rock and roll acts
[1:07:01.280 --> 1:07:03.280]  hip hop acts
[1:07:03.280 --> 1:07:05.280]  classical music
[1:07:05.280 --> 1:07:07.280]  you name it
[1:07:07.280 --> 1:07:09.280]  comedy shows
[1:07:09.280 --> 1:07:11.280]  entertainment venues
[1:07:11.280 --> 1:07:13.280]  are being cancelled in the next five months
[1:07:13.280 --> 1:07:15.280]  now remember
[1:07:15.280 --> 1:07:17.280]  the hundreds and hundreds
[1:07:17.280 --> 1:07:19.280]  actually thousands but hundreds of top
[1:07:19.280 --> 1:07:21.280]  out of the fortress 500
[1:07:21.280 --> 1:07:23.280]  over 200
[1:07:23.280 --> 1:07:25.280]  in late 2019
[1:07:27.280 --> 1:07:29.280]  resigned
[1:07:29.280 --> 1:07:31.280]  quit ahead of the pandemic
[1:07:31.280 --> 1:07:33.280]  ahead of the lockdowns ahead of the shutdown of society
[1:07:33.280 --> 1:07:35.280]  to get their money and get out
[1:07:35.280 --> 1:07:37.280]  why'd they do that
[1:07:37.280 --> 1:07:39.280]  because new management was being brought in too
[1:07:39.280 --> 1:07:41.280]  for the takeover because a lot of them were CEOs
[1:07:41.280 --> 1:07:43.280]  that didn't want to shut down the economy
[1:07:43.280 --> 1:07:45.280]  a lot of them were CEOs that didn't want to start people
[1:07:45.280 --> 1:07:47.280]  a lot of them wanted prosperity
[1:07:47.280 --> 1:07:49.280]  so they had that big purge
[1:07:49.280 --> 1:07:51.280]  of the leadership
[1:07:51.280 --> 1:07:53.280]  thousands of smaller companies
[1:07:53.280 --> 1:07:55.280]  and then during the lockdowns that went on
[1:07:55.280 --> 1:07:57.280]  tens of thousands of medium size companies
[1:07:57.280 --> 1:07:59.280]  by medium size
[1:07:59.280 --> 1:08:01.280]  we're talking 100 million dollar a year companies
[1:08:01.280 --> 1:08:03.280]  were bought up
[1:08:03.280 --> 1:08:05.280]  about a year and a half ago
[1:08:05.280 --> 1:08:07.280]  we had five or six manufacturers
[1:08:07.280 --> 1:08:09.280]  top supplement manufacturers
[1:08:09.280 --> 1:08:11.280]  we were diversified for our 30 plus products
[1:08:11.280 --> 1:08:13.280]  they reached out a bunch of them reached out
[1:08:13.280 --> 1:08:15.280]  and said we don't want to do business with you now
[1:08:15.280 --> 1:08:17.280]  we're not taking your money
[1:08:17.280 --> 1:08:19.280]  so we couldn't have that product
[1:08:19.280 --> 1:08:21.280]  and laugh us
[1:08:21.280 --> 1:08:23.280]  so we took the money back and found new manufacturers that were better
[1:08:23.280 --> 1:08:25.280]  but this is the level
[1:08:25.280 --> 1:08:27.280]  of bureaucratic economic war
[1:08:27.280 --> 1:08:29.280]  and we learned that BlackRock
[1:08:29.280 --> 1:08:31.280]  and all these big banks
[1:08:31.280 --> 1:08:33.280]  and all these big brokerage firms
[1:08:33.280 --> 1:08:35.280]  and hedge funds had come in and bought up
[1:08:35.280 --> 1:08:37.280]  more than half
[1:08:37.280 --> 1:08:39.280]  of the existing infrastructure
[1:08:39.280 --> 1:08:41.280]  so when they were seeing
[1:08:41.280 --> 1:08:43.280]  mom and pops are non-essential
[1:08:43.280 --> 1:08:45.280]  here's a year
[1:08:45.280 --> 1:08:47.280]  take money
[1:08:47.280 --> 1:08:49.280]  from your factories or whatever
[1:08:49.280 --> 1:08:51.280]  your 5,000 acre farm
[1:08:51.280 --> 1:08:53.280]  take money for a year not to work
[1:08:53.280 --> 1:08:55.280]  and then during that year
[1:08:55.280 --> 1:08:57.280]  they would get approached and said
[1:08:57.280 --> 1:08:59.280]  we'll pay you twice
[1:08:59.280 --> 1:09:01.280]  what your company's valued
[1:09:01.280 --> 1:09:03.280]  sell it to us
[1:09:03.280 --> 1:09:05.280]  and most people said we'll screw this
[1:09:05.280 --> 1:09:07.280]  I've already been sitting around for a year
[1:09:07.280 --> 1:09:09.280]  everything's falling apart, I'll take the money
[1:09:09.280 --> 1:09:11.280]  because the big central banks
[1:09:11.280 --> 1:09:13.280]  had unlimited
[1:09:13.280 --> 1:09:15.280]  funds
[1:09:15.280 --> 1:09:17.280]  unlimited funds
[1:09:17.280 --> 1:09:19.280]  through fiat currency creation
[1:09:19.280 --> 1:09:21.280]  to buy it all up
[1:09:21.280 --> 1:09:23.280]  this is mega banks with unlimited money
[1:09:23.280 --> 1:09:25.280]  cutting out the economy, squeezing things
[1:09:25.280 --> 1:09:27.280]  bankrupting people
[1:09:27.280 --> 1:09:29.280]  to bring in ownership control
[1:09:29.280 --> 1:09:31.280]  and then they can dictate how we live our lives
[1:09:31.280 --> 1:09:33.280]  with the social credit score
[1:09:33.280 --> 1:09:35.280]  the social credit score is everything
[1:09:35.280 --> 1:09:37.280]  the carbon tax
[1:09:37.280 --> 1:09:39.280]  the universal basic income that comes with it
[1:09:39.280 --> 1:09:41.280]  to dictate how you live your life
[1:09:41.280 --> 1:09:43.280]  this is the whole new system
[1:09:43.280 --> 1:09:45.280]  this is everything
[1:09:45.280 --> 1:09:47.280]  and for somebody informed
[1:09:47.280 --> 1:09:49.280]  like myself or our guest or our audience
[1:09:49.280 --> 1:09:51.280]  we already know this but imagine the general public
[1:09:51.280 --> 1:09:53.280]  doesn't know what's hitting them
[1:09:53.280 --> 1:09:55.280]  so this is just a lay person
[1:09:55.280 --> 1:09:57.280]  but that's the most important people
[1:09:57.280 --> 1:09:59.280]  that got hundreds of thousands of views
[1:09:59.280 --> 1:10:01.280]  on Instagram
[1:10:01.280 --> 1:10:03.280]  asking the question and I love how they say
[1:10:03.280 --> 1:10:05.280]  astrologists are saying the economy's going to implode
[1:10:05.280 --> 1:10:07.280]  well that's astrologists
[1:10:07.280 --> 1:10:09.280]  seeing the economy implode and say
[1:10:09.280 --> 1:10:11.280]  I'll make the prediction according to the stars
[1:10:11.280 --> 1:10:13.280]  this is going to happen
[1:10:13.280 --> 1:10:15.280]  I'm not a tagging astrologist but come on
[1:10:15.280 --> 1:10:17.280]  you don't go up astrologists, you go up the great reset
[1:10:17.280 --> 1:10:19.280]  and the global is saying they would do this
[1:10:19.280 --> 1:10:21.280]  but they do a good listing
[1:10:21.280 --> 1:10:23.280]  of some of the top acts
[1:10:23.280 --> 1:10:25.280]  that have just canceled going out and giving shows
[1:10:25.280 --> 1:10:27.280]  in the next five months
[1:10:27.280 --> 1:10:29.280]  because 56 days out from the election
[1:10:29.280 --> 1:10:31.280]  they're planning false flags
[1:10:31.280 --> 1:10:33.280]  I hope by exposing the false flags
[1:10:33.280 --> 1:10:35.280]  they don't do them
[1:10:35.280 --> 1:10:37.280]  I hope by people waking up, smarter people in the system
[1:10:37.280 --> 1:10:41.280]  say this is suicidal, let's not do this
[1:10:41.280 --> 1:10:43.280]  but we're going to go to your calls
[1:10:43.280 --> 1:10:45.280]  877-789-2539
[1:10:45.280 --> 1:10:47.280]  877-789
[1:10:47.280 --> 1:10:51.280]  Alex, 877-789-2539
[1:10:51.280 --> 1:10:53.280]  but let's play this clip
[1:10:53.280 --> 1:10:55.280]  that I was just mentioning
[1:10:55.280 --> 1:10:57.280]  where
[1:10:57.280 --> 1:11:00.280]  folks talk about all these big entertainment shows
[1:11:00.280 --> 1:11:02.280]  being canceled and I looked it up
[1:11:02.280 --> 1:11:04.280]  there were mainstream news articles admitting
[1:11:04.280 --> 1:11:07.280]  why are record numbers of entertainers
[1:11:07.280 --> 1:11:09.280]  from comedy to classical
[1:11:09.280 --> 1:11:11.280]  to blues to rock and roll
[1:11:11.280 --> 1:11:13.280]  to hip hop to country
[1:11:13.280 --> 1:11:15.280]  why are they all canceling?
[1:11:15.280 --> 1:11:18.280]  well one of their bosses been told
[1:11:18.280 --> 1:11:20.280]  is coming, a new virus
[1:11:20.280 --> 1:11:22.280]  power outages
[1:11:22.280 --> 1:11:24.280]  war?
[1:11:24.280 --> 1:11:26.280]  I mean your guess is as good as mine
[1:11:26.280 --> 1:11:28.280]  but we saw the record CEO
[1:11:28.280 --> 1:11:30.280]  resignations right before COVID
[1:11:30.280 --> 1:11:32.280]  this is a very valid point
[1:11:32.280 --> 1:11:34.280]  here's the report
[1:12:05.280 --> 1:12:07.280]  the art of war
[1:12:07.280 --> 1:12:09.280]  is to seem powerful when you're weak
[1:12:09.280 --> 1:12:11.280]  and weak when you're powerful
[1:12:11.280 --> 1:12:13.280]  this is a distraction
[1:12:13.280 --> 1:12:15.280]  and she could have passed away a long time ago
[1:12:15.280 --> 1:12:17.280]  as everyone's looking this way
[1:12:17.280 --> 1:12:19.280]  what's going on in the background
[1:12:19.280 --> 1:12:21.280]  Lou Combs cancelling

[1:12:32.280 --> 1:12:34.280]  for the upcoming months ahead
[1:12:34.280 --> 1:12:36.280]  where a lot of astrologers
[1:12:36.280 --> 1:12:38.280]  are saying some sort of
[1:12:38.280 --> 1:12:40.280]  violence could happen
[1:12:40.280 --> 1:12:42.280]  could a debt jubilee happen

[1:13:11.280 --> 1:13:13.280]  and they're saying it's because of
[1:13:13.280 --> 1:13:14.280]  low ticket sales
[1:13:14.280 --> 1:13:16.280]  if that's to be believed
[1:13:16.280 --> 1:13:17.280]  these big artists

[1:14:08.280 --> 1:14:10.280]  it's just very similar
[1:14:10.280 --> 1:14:12.280]  to the CEOs
[1:14:12.280 --> 1:14:14.280]  who left their post
[1:14:14.280 --> 1:14:15.280]  right before the lockdown
[1:14:15.280 --> 1:14:17.280]  as if they knew something was coming
[1:14:17.280 --> 1:14:19.280]  do these celebrities know
[1:14:19.280 --> 1:14:20.280]  something is on its way
[1:14:20.280 --> 1:14:22.280]  the queen just died
[1:14:22.280 --> 1:14:24.280]  but did she just die now
[1:14:24.280 --> 1:14:26.280]  or did she die a while ago
[1:14:26.280 --> 1:14:28.280]  and she dies at the age
[1:14:28.280 --> 1:14:31.280]  96 during her jubilee year
[1:14:35.280 --> 1:14:37.280]  as you can see right here
[1:14:37.280 --> 1:14:39.280]  the royal arch has the 6'9
[1:14:39.280 --> 1:14:41.280]  or the 9'6 on there
[1:14:41.280 --> 1:14:43.280]  this is very symbolic
[1:14:43.280 --> 1:14:45.280]  this is why bitcoin hits
[1:14:45.280 --> 1:14:47.280]  it's all time high at 6'9
[1:14:47.280 --> 1:14:49.280]  Elon's always tweeting about 6'9
[1:14:49.280 --> 1:14:51.280]  and the queen going through
[1:14:51.280 --> 1:14:53.280]  her platinum jubilee
[1:14:53.280 --> 1:14:55.280]  the 6'6 in there
[1:14:55.280 --> 1:14:58.280]  are we entering a debt jubilee
[1:14:58.280 --> 1:15:00.280]  which anthropologists said
[1:15:00.280 --> 1:15:02.280]  would have been an appropriate response
[1:15:02.280 --> 1:15:05.280]  to the 2008 financial crisis
[1:15:05.280 --> 1:15:07.280]  and we're seeing a lot of debt forgiveness
[1:15:07.280 --> 1:15:10.280]  student loans from Biden
[1:15:10.280 --> 1:15:12.280]  even the PPP loans
[1:15:12.280 --> 1:15:14.280]  that all the celebrities got
[1:15:14.280 --> 1:15:15.280]  millions of dollars
[1:15:15.280 --> 1:15:17.280]  are being forgiven
[1:15:17.280 --> 1:15:19.280]  these elite celebrities
[1:15:19.280 --> 1:15:21.280]  Jay-Z, Kanye, Diddy's
[1:15:21.280 --> 1:15:24.280]  multi-million dollar PPP loans
[1:15:24.280 --> 1:15:27.280]  alright so the point is that's going on
[1:15:27.280 --> 1:15:29.280]  you can read into it what you want
[1:15:29.280 --> 1:15:31.280]  but they don't forgive your debt
[1:15:31.280 --> 1:15:32.280]  to be nice to you
[1:15:32.280 --> 1:15:33.280]  they forgive your debt
[1:15:33.280 --> 1:15:36.280]  when you give them control over your life

[1:18:30.280 --> 1:18:33.280]  it is funding the information war

[1:18:56.280 --> 1:18:58.280]  1776coin.com
[1:18:58.280 --> 1:19:00.280]  Donald Trump and the magnet republicans
[1:19:00.280 --> 1:19:02.280]  represented extremism
[1:19:02.280 --> 1:19:04.280]  that threatens the very foundations
[1:19:04.280 --> 1:19:06.280]  of our republic
[1:19:06.280 --> 1:19:07.280]  I wouldn't be surprised
[1:19:07.280 --> 1:19:09.280]  if this doesn't have an operational name
[1:19:09.280 --> 1:19:11.280]  in fact I bet it does
[1:19:11.280 --> 1:19:13.280]  I bet it's called operation
[1:19:13.280 --> 1:19:14.280]  Matador
[1:19:14.280 --> 1:19:16.280]  they see us as the bull
[1:19:16.280 --> 1:19:17.280]  and they are shaking
[1:19:17.280 --> 1:19:20.280]  a red flag in our face
[1:19:20.280 --> 1:19:22.280]  and the Matador is the deep state
[1:19:22.280 --> 1:19:25.280]  with a long skinny razor sharp sword
[1:19:25.280 --> 1:19:27.280]  so that when the bull lunges forward
[1:19:27.280 --> 1:19:29.280]  the Matador uses the force of its weight
[1:19:29.280 --> 1:19:31.280]  to drive it into the heart
[1:19:31.280 --> 1:19:33.280]  and step aside with his cape
[1:19:33.280 --> 1:19:34.280]  as the bull
[1:19:34.280 --> 1:19:36.280]  buries himself into the dust
[1:19:36.280 --> 1:19:38.280]  they've got the ace of spades in their hand
[1:19:38.280 --> 1:19:40.280]  which is false flags
[1:19:40.280 --> 1:19:41.280]  before you launch a war
[1:19:41.280 --> 1:19:42.280]  you stage false flags
[1:19:42.280 --> 1:19:44.280]  that's the first thing you do
[1:19:44.280 --> 1:19:45.280]  because nobody wants to say
[1:19:45.280 --> 1:19:46.280]  they started a war
[1:19:46.280 --> 1:19:47.280]  and I start wars
[1:19:47.280 --> 1:19:49.280]  so every time a war gets launched
[1:19:49.280 --> 1:19:50.280]  by bad guys
[1:19:50.280 --> 1:19:51.280]  they stage an event
[1:19:51.280 --> 1:19:54.280]  this is operation Matador
[1:19:58.280 --> 1:20:00.280]  Leading a frontal assault
[1:20:00.280 --> 1:20:03.280]  on the lies of the New World Order
[1:20:03.280 --> 1:20:05.280]  it's Alex Jones
[1:20:05.280 --> 1:20:18.280]  Just how dishonest is the New York Times
[1:20:18.280 --> 1:20:20.280]  it's really a philosophical question
[1:20:20.280 --> 1:20:21.280]  it's hard to answer directly
[1:20:21.280 --> 1:20:22.280]  let's see
[1:20:22.280 --> 1:20:24.280]  how drunk was the guy you saw passed out
[1:20:24.280 --> 1:20:26.280]  in the men's room at a Packers game
[1:20:26.280 --> 1:20:29.280]  how angry is Hillary Clinton at her husband
[1:20:29.280 --> 1:20:32.280]  well the answer in all cases is very
[1:20:32.280 --> 1:20:33.280]  extremely
[1:20:33.280 --> 1:20:35.280]  so thoroughly and so totally
[1:20:35.280 --> 1:20:37.280]  that it's hard to put into words
[1:20:37.280 --> 1:20:39.280]  so instead of describing the dishonesty
[1:20:39.280 --> 1:20:40.280]  of the New York Times
[1:20:40.280 --> 1:20:41.280]  with conventional adjectives
[1:20:41.280 --> 1:20:43.280]  we'll give you a specific example
[1:20:43.280 --> 1:20:44.280]  because we think it tells you more
[1:20:44.280 --> 1:20:45.280]  so last week
[1:20:45.280 --> 1:20:46.280]  the paper told us
[1:20:46.280 --> 1:20:48.280]  that the bestselling book in the United States
[1:20:48.280 --> 1:20:49.280]  was titled called
[1:20:49.280 --> 1:20:51.280]  I'm Glad My Mom Died
[1:20:51.280 --> 1:20:53.280]  by a child actress called Jeanette McCurdy
[1:20:53.280 --> 1:20:54.280]  but that was not true
[1:20:54.280 --> 1:20:56.280]  that book was not the bestselling book in America
[1:20:56.280 --> 1:20:57.280]  in fact
[1:20:57.280 --> 1:20:59.280]  the bestselling book in America last week
[1:20:59.280 --> 1:21:01.280]  was the great reset
[1:21:01.280 --> 1:21:03.280]  The War for the World
[1:21:03.280 --> 1:21:05.280]  written by Alex Jones
[1:21:05.280 --> 1:21:07.280]  Jones sold more than 56,000 copies
[1:21:07.280 --> 1:21:09.280]  of his book last week
[1:21:09.280 --> 1:21:10.280]  Jeanette McCurdy
[1:21:10.280 --> 1:21:11.280]  whatever her merits
[1:21:11.280 --> 1:21:12.280]  we have no idea
[1:21:12.280 --> 1:21:15.280]  sold 34,686 copies
[1:21:15.280 --> 1:21:16.280]  of her book
[1:21:16.280 --> 1:21:17.280]  so Alex Jones
[1:21:17.280 --> 1:21:19.280]  sold a lot more books
[1:21:19.280 --> 1:21:21.280]  Alex Jones had the biggest book in the country
[1:21:21.280 --> 1:21:23.280]  but the New York Times lied about that
[1:21:23.280 --> 1:21:25.280]  because the New York Times doesn't want you to know that
[1:21:25.280 --> 1:21:26.280]  the New York Times wants you to believe
[1:21:26.280 --> 1:21:28.280]  that Alex Jones is more discredited
[1:21:28.280 --> 1:21:29.280]  than in the New York Times
[1:21:29.280 --> 1:21:31.280]  the paper that started the Iraq War
[1:21:31.280 --> 1:21:33.280]  by lying about weapons mass destruction
[1:21:33.280 --> 1:21:34.280]  and got a million people killed
[1:21:34.280 --> 1:21:36.280]  but Alex Jones is worse
[1:21:36.280 --> 1:21:37.280]  he's a mental patient
[1:21:37.280 --> 1:21:39.280]  no one listens to him
[1:21:39.280 --> 1:21:41.280]  so they lied about his book
[1:21:41.280 --> 1:21:42.280]  what else are they lying about
[1:21:42.280 --> 1:21:43.280]  you wonder
[1:21:43.280 --> 1:21:45.280]  this new war
[1:21:45.280 --> 1:21:48.280]  is purely economic and cultural
[1:21:48.280 --> 1:21:50.280]  and they're trying to strangle
[1:21:50.280 --> 1:21:51.280]  our farmers
[1:21:51.280 --> 1:21:52.280]  our ranchers
[1:21:52.280 --> 1:21:53.280]  our industry
[1:21:53.280 --> 1:21:54.280]  our borders
[1:21:54.280 --> 1:21:55.280]  our nation
[1:21:55.280 --> 1:21:56.280]  that's why I'm here saying
[1:21:56.280 --> 1:21:57.280]  I need funding
[1:21:57.280 --> 1:21:58.280]  they are focusing everything they can
[1:21:58.280 --> 1:22:00.280]  they're in rigged trials
[1:22:00.280 --> 1:22:02.280]  saying we want to shut him down
[1:22:02.280 --> 1:22:03.280]  we filed for bankruptcy
[1:22:03.280 --> 1:22:04.280]  they go in and say
[1:22:04.280 --> 1:22:05.280]  we don't want money for the planners
[1:22:05.280 --> 1:22:07.280]  we want him off the air
[1:22:07.280 --> 1:22:08.280]  that's what I'm trying to explain to you
[1:22:08.280 --> 1:22:10.280]  I'm putting everything I've got
[1:22:10.280 --> 1:22:12.280]  including my book sales
[1:22:12.280 --> 1:22:13.280]  into free speech systems
[1:22:13.280 --> 1:22:15.280]  and to keep Info Wars on the air
[1:22:15.280 --> 1:22:16.280]  because everybody's tuning in
[1:22:16.280 --> 1:22:17.280]  we're exploding
[1:22:17.280 --> 1:22:19.280]  we're having massive victory
[1:22:19.280 --> 1:22:22.280]  as we are economically being crushed
[1:22:22.280 --> 1:22:24.280]  so the great reset in the war for the world
[1:22:24.280 --> 1:22:26.280]  you can get it at infowarstore.com
[1:22:26.280 --> 1:22:28.280]  that keeps us on the air
[1:22:28.280 --> 1:22:30.280]  takes a lot of money to fight a war
[1:22:30.280 --> 1:22:31.280]  I'm going to go to your phone calls
[1:22:31.280 --> 1:22:32.280]  here in just a moment
[1:22:32.280 --> 1:22:34.280]  but first let's talk about
[1:22:34.280 --> 1:22:36.280]  the fourth coin
[1:22:36.280 --> 1:22:38.280]  at 1776coin.com
[1:22:38.280 --> 1:22:42.280]  the Teddy Roosevelt man in the arena coin
[1:22:42.280 --> 1:22:44.280]  the first three were the founding member coin
[1:22:44.280 --> 1:22:46.280]  and people that were founding members
[1:22:46.280 --> 1:22:48.280]  get a big discount code sent to them
[1:22:48.280 --> 1:22:49.280]  on the next coin
[1:22:49.280 --> 1:22:50.280]  get a bunch of other stuff
[1:22:50.280 --> 1:22:51.280]  or get ready to launch
[1:22:51.280 --> 1:22:52.280]  we're behind in our projects
[1:22:52.280 --> 1:22:54.280]  but they're all about to launch
[1:22:54.280 --> 1:22:55.280]  but here's the man in the arena
[1:22:55.280 --> 1:22:57.280]  the man in the arena is not the critic who counts
[1:22:57.280 --> 1:23:00.280]  not the man who points out how the strongman stumbles
[1:23:00.280 --> 1:23:02.280]  or where the doer of deeds could have done them better
[1:23:02.280 --> 1:23:04.280]  but the credit belongs to the man
[1:23:04.280 --> 1:23:05.280]  who was actually in the arena
[1:23:05.280 --> 1:23:08.280]  whose face is marred with dust and sweat and blood
[1:23:08.280 --> 1:23:10.280]  who strives valiantly, who errs
[1:23:10.280 --> 1:23:12.280]  who comes short again and again
[1:23:12.280 --> 1:23:14.280]  because there is no effort without error
[1:23:14.280 --> 1:23:15.280]  and shortcomings
[1:23:15.280 --> 1:23:17.280]  but who does actually strive to do the deeds
[1:23:17.280 --> 1:23:20.280]  who knows the great enthusiasm
[1:23:20.280 --> 1:23:21.280]  the great devotions
[1:23:21.280 --> 1:23:23.280]  who spends himself on a worthy cause
[1:23:23.280 --> 1:23:25.280]  who at the best does in the end
[1:23:25.280 --> 1:23:27.280]  the triumph of high achievement
[1:23:27.280 --> 1:23:28.280]  and who at the worst
[1:23:28.280 --> 1:23:31.280]  if he fails at least fails while daring greatly
[1:23:31.280 --> 1:23:33.280]  so that his place shall never be
[1:23:33.280 --> 1:23:35.280]  never be, never be
[1:23:35.280 --> 1:23:38.280]  with those cold and timid souls
[1:23:38.280 --> 1:23:42.280]  who know neither victory nor defeat
[1:23:42.280 --> 1:23:43.280]  it's a historic coin
[1:23:43.280 --> 1:23:45.280]  only one chance to get it
[1:23:45.280 --> 1:23:48.280]  it'll sell out in ten days at current sales rates
[1:23:48.280 --> 1:23:49.280]  we need the funds to stay on air
[1:23:49.280 --> 1:23:51.280]  I'm dumping everything I've got in
[1:23:51.280 --> 1:23:53.280]  I need you to in this fight
[1:23:53.280 --> 1:23:55.280]  and it's going to get clear and clear what's happening
[1:23:55.280 --> 1:23:57.280]  with the purges and the attacks
[1:23:57.280 --> 1:23:58.280]  we're going to be steadfast
[1:23:58.280 --> 1:23:59.280]  we never give up
[1:23:59.280 --> 1:24:00.280]  we never give in
[1:24:00.280 --> 1:24:01.280]  we can give out
[1:24:01.280 --> 1:24:02.280]  thank you for your support

[1:24:14.280 --> 1:24:15.280]  man the arena coin
[1:24:15.280 --> 1:24:17.280]  I want to thank you all for your support
[1:24:17.280 --> 1:24:19.280]  number one book in the world
[1:24:19.280 --> 1:24:22.280]  I got $80,000 just paid to me in the first payment
[1:24:22.280 --> 1:24:24.280]  they think I'll probably make a few million dollars
[1:24:24.280 --> 1:24:25.280]  off the book
[1:24:25.280 --> 1:24:27.280]  great it's all getting dumped in
[1:24:27.280 --> 1:24:29.280]  to this operation
[1:24:29.280 --> 1:24:31.280]  and this war against the globalist
[1:24:31.280 --> 1:24:33.280]  and all the lawsuits and the trials and the attacks
[1:24:33.280 --> 1:24:35.280]  we're going to follow the appeals
[1:24:35.280 --> 1:24:37.280]  and we're going to continue to battle them
[1:24:37.280 --> 1:24:39.280]  for years and keep this operation going
[1:24:41.280 --> 1:24:43.280]  but it's up to you to fund the operation
[1:24:43.280 --> 1:24:44.280]  thanks for your support
[1:24:44.280 --> 1:24:46.280]  m4store.com
[1:24:46.280 --> 1:24:47.280]  they deindustrialized America
[1:24:47.280 --> 1:24:49.280]  they've done one-sided trade deals
[1:24:49.280 --> 1:24:50.280]  to shut you down
[1:24:50.280 --> 1:24:52.280]  everything they're doing to me they're doing to you
[1:24:52.280 --> 1:24:54.280]  we're just the focal point of that fight
[1:24:54.280 --> 1:24:56.280]  1776coin.com
[1:24:56.280 --> 1:24:59.280]  I'd like to see a sign of liberty
[1:24:59.280 --> 1:25:02.280]  and just sell out the 9,000 coins that are left
[1:25:02.280 --> 1:25:03.280]  sold a thousand yesterday
[1:25:03.280 --> 1:25:05.280]  I want to see them sold today
[1:25:05.280 --> 1:25:06.280]  be part of history
[1:25:06.280 --> 1:25:08.280]  be the man in the arena now
[1:25:08.280 --> 1:25:09.280]  and thank you for your support
[1:25:09.280 --> 1:25:10.280]  I salute you
[1:25:10.280 --> 1:25:11.280]  take action now
[1:25:11.280 --> 1:25:13.280]  don't sit on the sidelines
[1:25:13.280 --> 1:25:15.280]  1776coin.com
[1:25:15.280 --> 1:25:17.280]  all right
[1:25:17.280 --> 1:25:19.280]  the rest of the hour taking your phone calls
[1:25:19.280 --> 1:25:20.280]  and then Dr. Peter Bregen
[1:25:20.280 --> 1:25:21.280]  it's going to be incredible
[1:25:21.280 --> 1:25:23.280]  you think mass formation is powerful
[1:25:23.280 --> 1:25:25.280]  this is the next level of their mind control
[1:25:25.280 --> 1:25:26.280]  their own documents
[1:25:26.280 --> 1:25:27.280]  their own admissions
[1:25:27.280 --> 1:25:29.280]  I've really prepared for this third hour
[1:25:29.280 --> 1:25:30.280]  get ready for it
[1:25:30.280 --> 1:25:32.280]  but right now
[1:25:32.280 --> 1:25:34.280]  who's up first here
[1:25:37.280 --> 1:25:39.280]  what calls should I go to first
[1:25:39.280 --> 1:25:41.280]  let's go to Jordan in New Jersey
[1:25:41.280 --> 1:25:43.280]  Jordan you're on the air welcome
[1:25:43.280 --> 1:25:45.280]  hi Alex can you hear me
[1:25:45.280 --> 1:25:47.280]  I can brother thanks for calling
[1:25:47.280 --> 1:25:48.280]  thank you
[1:25:48.280 --> 1:25:50.280]  so I'm glad you haven't
[1:25:50.280 --> 1:25:51.280]  Dr. Bregen on
[1:25:51.280 --> 1:25:53.280]  because he's made some comments
[1:25:53.280 --> 1:25:55.280]  about the NIH funding
[1:25:55.280 --> 1:25:56.280]  and you know
[1:25:56.280 --> 1:25:58.280]  he said some things about Dr. Malone on the war room
[1:25:58.280 --> 1:25:59.280]  I know which was controversial
[1:25:59.280 --> 1:26:01.280]  I hope you discuss that with him
[1:26:01.280 --> 1:26:02.280]  when Christy Lee interviewed him
[1:26:02.280 --> 1:26:03.280]  I guess on the 9th of September
[1:26:03.280 --> 1:26:05.280]  but I just want to state
[1:26:05.280 --> 1:26:07.280]  that all this research
[1:26:07.280 --> 1:26:10.280]  that used to be traceable to the NIH grant funding
[1:26:10.280 --> 1:26:12.280]  is now kind of going underground a little bit
[1:26:12.280 --> 1:26:14.280]  to the the COVID
[1:26:14.280 --> 1:26:15.280]  or the NIH active
[1:26:15.280 --> 1:26:17.280]  where it's going to be all cloaked
[1:26:17.280 --> 1:26:18.280]  using you know
[1:26:18.280 --> 1:26:20.280]  private institutions and so forth
[1:26:20.280 --> 1:26:21.280]  to release some of this stuff
[1:26:21.280 --> 1:26:23.280]  making it harder to trace
[1:26:23.280 --> 1:26:24.280]  who's funding it
[1:26:24.280 --> 1:26:27.280]  and some of the results of the actual research
[1:26:27.280 --> 1:26:29.280]  so I hope that you're asking some questions about
[1:26:29.280 --> 1:26:32.280]  his disagreement on the aspect of Dr. Malone
[1:26:32.280 --> 1:26:34.280]  as well as where this funding
[1:26:34.280 --> 1:26:36.280]  for what is called COVID
[1:26:36.280 --> 1:26:39.280]  which is all really the technology
[1:26:39.280 --> 1:26:41.280]  in order to get everybody into this digital currency system
[1:26:41.280 --> 1:26:45.280]  where they can monitor everybody's physiological activity
[1:26:45.280 --> 1:26:47.280]  in a social credit score system
[1:26:47.280 --> 1:26:49.280]  and I think that there was
[1:26:49.280 --> 1:26:51.280]  I was on earlier with Harrison
[1:26:51.280 --> 1:26:52.280]  and there was another caller
[1:26:52.280 --> 1:26:55.280]  talked about the implementation of the CBDC
[1:26:55.280 --> 1:26:57.280]  digital bank currency
[1:26:57.280 --> 1:27:00.280]  which is working in tandem for them to be able to measure
[1:27:00.280 --> 1:27:03.280]  have the metrics in order to issue the currency
[1:27:03.280 --> 1:27:05.280]  and then use their punishment punitive system
[1:27:05.280 --> 1:27:06.280]  for the people to survive
[1:27:06.280 --> 1:27:08.280]  the technology being implemented into them
[1:27:08.280 --> 1:27:12.280]  in the final aspect of their plan
[1:27:12.280 --> 1:27:13.280]  which you laid out in a great reset
[1:27:13.280 --> 1:27:16.280]  That's right, they stop kill the people that buy the lie
[1:27:16.280 --> 1:27:21.280]  and then they put us in digital cultural gulags that don't
[1:27:21.280 --> 1:27:23.280]  Yes, and so this is coming
[1:27:23.280 --> 1:27:25.280]  and these cancellations of these folks
[1:27:25.280 --> 1:27:27.280]  and all these pores and everything like that
[1:27:27.280 --> 1:27:28.280]  is that there will be an event
[1:27:28.280 --> 1:27:30.280]  I don't know exactly how they're going to string it together
[1:27:30.280 --> 1:27:32.280]  but they need to do two main things here
[1:27:32.280 --> 1:27:33.280]  there's probably a third element
[1:27:33.280 --> 1:27:34.280]  but I know two main things
[1:27:34.280 --> 1:27:35.280]  and you do too
[1:27:35.280 --> 1:27:37.280]  which is the implementation of this digital currency
[1:27:37.280 --> 1:27:40.280]  as well as a way of monitoring controlling that
[1:27:40.280 --> 1:27:42.280]  which is left with humanity
[1:27:42.280 --> 1:27:47.280]  and so I want to state that they've been issuing patents
[1:27:47.280 --> 1:27:50.280]  from the Libre team under different cutouts now
[1:27:50.280 --> 1:27:53.280]  that actually are patenting the technology
[1:27:53.280 --> 1:27:55.280]  that worked from these things that they injected into us
[1:27:55.280 --> 1:27:56.280]  over the last two years
[1:27:56.280 --> 1:27:58.280]  and I have the patent numbers and all the rest of it
[1:27:58.280 --> 1:27:59.280]  I'm going to do a video
[1:27:59.280 --> 1:28:00.280]  I'm going to try to bring it to you
[1:28:00.280 --> 1:28:01.280]  George, you called before
[1:28:01.280 --> 1:28:03.280]  you used to work for what, Pfizer?
[1:28:03.280 --> 1:28:06.280]  I worked for BMS and I worked for GSK
[1:28:06.280 --> 1:28:09.280]  so both of them
[1:28:09.280 --> 1:28:11.280]  separate portions of my career in R&D
[1:28:11.280 --> 1:28:13.280]  so I just want to let you know
[1:28:13.280 --> 1:28:15.280]  that they have to get this technology in
[1:28:15.280 --> 1:28:16.280]  I don't know what it's going to be
[1:28:16.280 --> 1:28:17.280]  but they have to have both
[1:28:17.280 --> 1:28:19.280]  so whatever they do has to tie the two together
[1:28:19.280 --> 1:28:22.280]  and it means that the 30% or so that didn't get injected
[1:28:22.280 --> 1:28:24.280]  they either have to die
[1:28:24.280 --> 1:28:26.280]  and be invested
[1:28:26.280 --> 1:28:29.280]  or they have to take the injections
[1:28:29.280 --> 1:28:30.280]  This is such an incredible thing
[1:28:30.280 --> 1:28:33.280]  and look at all the idiots that play along
[1:28:33.280 --> 1:28:36.280]  pretending they're part of the power structure
[1:28:36.280 --> 1:28:37.280]  It is so sad and sub-athetic
[1:28:37.280 --> 1:28:39.280]  Thank you, Jordan
[1:28:39.280 --> 1:28:40.280]  All right
[1:28:40.280 --> 1:28:43.280]  Parlos, Bonecrusher, Jason, Steve, Reg
[1:28:43.280 --> 1:28:46.280]  Steve, Casey, Vidal, Nick
[1:28:46.280 --> 1:28:48.280]  I'm going to your calls when we come back
[1:28:48.280 --> 1:28:50.280]  Bam, bam, bam
[1:28:50.280 --> 1:28:51.280]  I want to thank all the viewers and listeners
[1:28:51.280 --> 1:28:53.280]  for spreading the live feed
[1:28:53.280 --> 1:28:54.280]  from infowars.com
[1:28:54.280 --> 1:28:56.280]  for our live show
[1:28:58.280 --> 1:28:59.280]  People ask me all the time
[1:28:59.280 --> 1:29:01.280]  What is your best new tropic?
[1:29:01.280 --> 1:29:03.280]  You've got TurboForce
[1:29:03.280 --> 1:29:05.280]  You've got Brainforce Plus
[1:29:05.280 --> 1:29:07.280]  and you've got Brainforce Ultra
[1:29:07.280 --> 1:29:09.280]  Which one is better?
[1:29:09.280 --> 1:29:11.280]  And that's like asking
[1:29:11.280 --> 1:29:13.280]  what's better, a Ford F-150
[1:29:13.280 --> 1:29:15.280]  or a Cadillac
[1:29:15.280 --> 1:29:17.280]  or a Ferrari
[1:29:17.280 --> 1:29:19.280]  It's different strokes for different folks
[1:29:19.280 --> 1:29:21.280]  It varies
[1:29:21.280 --> 1:29:23.280]  All three are different formulas
[1:29:23.280 --> 1:29:25.280]  All three do different things
[1:29:25.280 --> 1:29:27.280]  TurboForce is 10 hours of clean
[1:29:27.280 --> 1:29:29.280]  out of control energy
[1:29:29.280 --> 1:29:31.280]  I can't even take a whole pack myself
[1:29:31.280 --> 1:29:33.280]  Brainforce Plus is a long-term
[1:29:33.280 --> 1:29:35.280]  acting clean, neutral
[1:29:35.280 --> 1:29:37.280]  This Brainforce Ultra
[1:29:37.280 --> 1:29:39.280]  is a super fast acting
[1:29:39.280 --> 1:29:41.280]  neutral pick
[1:29:41.280 --> 1:29:43.280]  It creates incredible clarity
[1:29:43.280 --> 1:29:44.280]  but doesn't last very long
[1:29:44.280 --> 1:29:46.280]  They're all three different formulas
[1:29:46.280 --> 1:29:48.280]  And finally, back in stock
[1:29:48.280 --> 1:29:49.280]  massively discounted

[1:30:03.280 --> 1:30:05.280]  with wheatgrass
[1:30:05.280 --> 1:30:07.280]  and so many other ingredients that are known
[1:30:07.280 --> 1:30:09.280]  to make us healthy
[1:30:09.280 --> 1:30:11.280]  to make us vibrant
[1:30:11.280 --> 1:30:13.280]  and to defend our immune systems
[1:30:13.280 --> 1:30:15.280]  Now over a year and a half ago

[1:30:17.280 --> 1:30:19.280]  top of the line

[1:30:21.280 --> 1:30:23.280]  but then the supply chain broke down
[1:30:23.280 --> 1:30:25.280]  and it was sold out for more than a year

[1:32:27.280 --> 1:32:29.280]  making dinner for my daughter
[1:32:29.280 --> 1:32:31.280]  my four national daughter
[1:32:31.280 --> 1:32:33.280]  my wife makes dinner a lot of times
[1:32:33.280 --> 1:32:35.280]  but I like to make it as well
[1:32:35.280 --> 1:32:37.280]  I love to make breakfast
[1:32:37.280 --> 1:32:39.280]  and literally it's the funnest thing on earth
[1:32:39.280 --> 1:32:41.280]  to make food for your family
[1:32:41.280 --> 1:32:43.280]  and be nurturative
[1:32:43.280 --> 1:32:45.280]  and then all sit down together
[1:32:45.280 --> 1:32:47.280]  and have the communal event
[1:32:47.280 --> 1:32:49.280]  and that's what the system is attacking
[1:32:49.280 --> 1:32:51.280]  and bombarded
[1:32:51.280 --> 1:32:53.280]  is our normal biological actions
[1:32:53.280 --> 1:32:55.280]  that will demesticate us
[1:32:55.280 --> 1:32:57.280]  and turn us into lab rats
[1:32:57.280 --> 1:32:59.280]  we cannot let this continue
[1:32:59.280 --> 1:33:01.280]  Leading a frontal assault
[1:33:01.280 --> 1:33:03.280]  on the lies of the New World Order
[1:33:03.280 --> 1:33:05.280]  it's Alex Jones
[1:33:13.280 --> 1:33:15.280]  The answer to 1984
[1:33:15.280 --> 1:33:17.280]  is 1776

[1:33:21.280 --> 1:33:23.280]  Broadcasting Worldwide
[1:33:23.280 --> 1:33:25.280]  It's Alex Jones
[1:33:27.280 --> 1:33:29.280]  Alright on this live Tuesday broadcast
[1:33:29.280 --> 1:33:31.280]  September 13th, check out your phone calls
[1:33:31.280 --> 1:33:33.280]  Let's go ahead and talk to
[1:33:33.280 --> 1:33:35.280]  Stephen in FEMA Region 4
[1:33:35.280 --> 1:33:37.280]  You're on the air, go ahead sir
[1:33:37.280 --> 1:33:39.280]  Alex, we're roughly the same age
[1:33:39.280 --> 1:33:41.280]  and I've been listening to you on shortwave radio
[1:33:41.280 --> 1:33:43.280]  since 1999 brother
[1:33:43.280 --> 1:33:45.280]  and I love you
[1:33:45.280 --> 1:33:47.280]  and I love you all
[1:33:47.280 --> 1:33:49.280]  your crew, I love everyone there
[1:33:49.280 --> 1:33:51.280]  Harrison Smith, I listen to War Room
[1:33:51.280 --> 1:33:53.280]  Owen Sawyer, you guys
[1:33:53.280 --> 1:33:55.280]  constantly put out all the information
[1:33:55.280 --> 1:33:57.280]  that everyone needs to hear
[1:33:57.280 --> 1:33:59.280]  and with that being said
[1:33:59.280 --> 1:34:01.280]  I ordered a signed copy of your book
[1:34:01.280 --> 1:34:03.280]  I ordered a few copies on Amazon
[1:34:03.280 --> 1:34:05.280]  I sent out as gifts, everyone needs to read this book
[1:34:05.280 --> 1:34:07.280]  this should be in every classroom in America
[1:34:07.280 --> 1:34:09.280]  every child should be getting CRT
[1:34:09.280 --> 1:34:11.280]  they should be reading the great reset of the world
[1:34:11.280 --> 1:34:13.280]  that's what they should be reading
[1:34:13.280 --> 1:34:15.280]  because if they want to know how it all works
[1:34:15.280 --> 1:34:17.280]  and how it all unfolds and how they're trying to kill us all
[1:34:17.280 --> 1:34:19.280]  that's what they need to get
[1:34:19.280 --> 1:34:21.280]  that's what they need to be reading
[1:34:21.280 --> 1:34:23.280]  they need to see the corruption there
[1:34:23.280 --> 1:34:25.280]  no American voters voted for the World Economic Forum
[1:34:25.280 --> 1:34:27.280]  no one voted for Klaus Schwab
[1:34:27.280 --> 1:34:29.280]  they should be listed as a terrorist organization
[1:34:29.280 --> 1:34:31.280]  by the State Department
[1:34:31.280 --> 1:34:33.280]  eating bugs, killing power
[1:34:33.280 --> 1:34:35.280]  now you got King Charles III, Bill Gates
[1:34:35.280 --> 1:34:37.280]  and the Bush family with the UNESCO
[1:34:37.280 --> 1:34:39.280]  and the Clintons and Larry Fink
[1:34:39.280 --> 1:34:41.280]  all these guys are all our enemies
[1:34:41.280 --> 1:34:43.280]  these guys are part of the same group
[1:34:43.280 --> 1:34:45.280]  I learned this from you
[1:34:45.280 --> 1:34:47.280]  they reset in the years of listening
[1:34:47.280 --> 1:34:49.280]  and thousands of scientists
[1:34:49.280 --> 1:34:51.280]  are saying there is no climate crisis
[1:34:51.280 --> 1:34:53.280]  there's zero and they're going to mandate
[1:34:53.280 --> 1:34:55.280]  this power, this green new deal
[1:34:55.280 --> 1:34:57.280]  just like they did the vaccines
[1:34:57.280 --> 1:34:59.280]  I can't say
[1:34:59.280 --> 1:35:01.280]  what industry I'm working in
[1:35:01.280 --> 1:35:03.280]  but big data is another big part of the puzzle
[1:35:03.280 --> 1:35:05.280]  that needs to be looked into
[1:35:05.280 --> 1:35:07.280]  and we need more whistleblowers coming forward
[1:35:07.280 --> 1:35:09.280]  that's all I can say, we need more
[1:35:09.280 --> 1:35:11.280]  and more whistleblowers Alex
[1:35:11.280 --> 1:35:13.280]  well that's why they're attacking the regular infrastructure
[1:35:13.280 --> 1:35:15.280]  is to force us into the AI control system
[1:35:15.280 --> 1:35:17.280]  not using big tech to empower people
[1:35:17.280 --> 1:35:19.280]  but to micromanage the controllers
[1:35:19.280 --> 1:35:21.280]  they admit that's their plan
[1:35:21.280 --> 1:35:23.280]  so if people just wake up it's game over
[1:35:23.280 --> 1:35:25.280]  and it's very encouraging that the war for the world
[1:35:25.280 --> 1:35:27.280]  the great reset in the war for the world
[1:35:27.280 --> 1:35:29.280]  is the number one book right now
[1:35:29.280 --> 1:35:31.280]  yes sir and like I said
[1:35:31.280 --> 1:35:33.280]  this needs to be not just in everyone's library
[1:35:33.280 --> 1:35:35.280]  next to their Bible this needs to be
[1:35:35.280 --> 1:35:37.280]  in the classrooms of America
[1:35:37.280 --> 1:35:39.280]  these monsters need to be exposed for who they are
[1:35:39.280 --> 1:35:41.280]  and you did a phenomenal job
[1:35:41.280 --> 1:35:43.280]  on this book brother
[1:35:43.280 --> 1:35:45.280]  Steve, you did a phenomenal job
[1:35:45.280 --> 1:35:47.280]  keeping us on air without you
[1:35:47.280 --> 1:35:49.280]  we could not direct this information
[1:35:49.280 --> 1:35:51.280]  and stop the enemy
[1:35:51.280 --> 1:35:53.280]  God bless you and thank you so much
[1:35:53.280 --> 1:35:55.280]  yes ladies and gentlemen
[1:35:55.280 --> 1:35:57.280]  everybody should get the great reset in the war for the world
[1:35:57.280 --> 1:35:59.280]  at m4shore.com but whatever you do
[1:35:59.280 --> 1:36:01.280]  give it to your library share it with others
[1:36:01.280 --> 1:36:03.280]  just people need to know what they're really facing
[1:36:03.280 --> 1:36:05.280]  and what they're up against
[1:36:05.280 --> 1:36:07.280]  okay let's go to the next caller
[1:36:07.280 --> 1:36:09.280]  let's go to Bonecrusher
[1:36:09.280 --> 1:36:11.280]  they're on the west coast
[1:36:11.280 --> 1:36:13.280]  go ahead Bonecrusher
[1:36:13.280 --> 1:36:15.280]  Alex, I just kind of wanted to talk about
[1:36:15.280 --> 1:36:17.280]  some of the attack that's going on
[1:36:17.280 --> 1:36:19.280]  with the kids these days
[1:36:19.280 --> 1:36:21.280]  so recently I started working
[1:36:21.280 --> 1:36:23.280]  with some kind of at risk youth
[1:36:23.280 --> 1:36:25.280]  and you know I've been listening
[1:36:25.280 --> 1:36:27.280]  to you forever since
[1:36:27.280 --> 1:36:29.280]  like I was in high school years
[1:36:29.280 --> 1:36:31.280]  ago over a decade ago at least
[1:36:31.280 --> 1:36:33.280]  and uh
[1:36:33.280 --> 1:36:35.280]  just been hearing you talk a lot about
[1:36:35.280 --> 1:36:37.280]  you know the attack on kids and all this gender stuff
[1:36:37.280 --> 1:36:39.280]  that's going on and everything
[1:36:39.280 --> 1:36:41.280]  and I haven't really seen a lot of it
[1:36:41.280 --> 1:36:43.280]  with my own eyes
[1:36:43.280 --> 1:36:45.280]  but recently after starting working with a lot of these
[1:36:45.280 --> 1:36:47.280]  youths and stuff
[1:36:47.280 --> 1:36:49.280]  over 30% of these kids are
[1:36:49.280 --> 1:36:51.280]  identifying as an opposite gender
[1:36:51.280 --> 1:36:53.280]  and it's just crazy
[1:36:53.280 --> 1:36:55.280]  and they're changing their names all the time
[1:36:55.280 --> 1:36:57.280]  and stuff I heard one of these kids
[1:36:57.280 --> 1:36:59.280]  the other day and they said it
[1:36:59.280 --> 1:37:01.280]  dead serious with a straight face they said
[1:37:01.280 --> 1:37:03.280]  my brother is pregnant
[1:37:03.280 --> 1:37:05.280]  sick
[1:37:05.280 --> 1:37:07.280]  it's crazy
[1:37:07.280 --> 1:37:09.280]  it's crazy
[1:37:09.280 --> 1:37:11.280]  so where do you see this going?
[1:37:11.280 --> 1:37:13.280]  I mean
[1:37:13.280 --> 1:37:15.280]  the course that we're on right now it's not good
[1:37:15.280 --> 1:37:17.280]  and even just
[1:37:17.280 --> 1:37:19.280]  with all that
[1:37:19.280 --> 1:37:21.280]  messing with their gender and stuff
[1:37:21.280 --> 1:37:23.280]  and messing with their heads and then on top of that
[1:37:23.280 --> 1:37:25.280]  we've got homeless camps
[1:37:25.280 --> 1:37:27.280]  popping up everywhere and I know that
[1:37:27.280 --> 1:37:29.280]  some of these kids were being pimped out
[1:37:29.280 --> 1:37:31.280]  at the homeless camps for drugs and stuff
[1:37:31.280 --> 1:37:33.280]  absolutely
[1:37:33.280 --> 1:37:35.280]  terrible
[1:37:35.280 --> 1:37:37.280]  well this is the designed
[1:37:37.280 --> 1:37:39.280]  take down of civilization
[1:37:39.280 --> 1:37:41.280]  I mean the senate reported
[1:37:41.280 --> 1:37:43.280]  six years ago
[1:37:43.280 --> 1:37:45.280]  tens of thousands of children in sex slavery
[1:37:45.280 --> 1:37:47.280]  that Obama authorized
[1:37:47.280 --> 1:37:49.280]  Trump tried to stop it and now the floodgates
[1:37:49.280 --> 1:37:51.280]  are just open it's just incredible
[1:37:51.280 --> 1:37:53.280]  it is
[1:37:53.280 --> 1:37:55.280]  and it's real like I said you know
[1:37:55.280 --> 1:37:57.280]  I would hear you talking about it and stuff
[1:37:57.280 --> 1:37:59.280]  and like you always say tomorrow's news today
[1:37:59.280 --> 1:38:01.280]  and you are and
[1:38:01.280 --> 1:38:03.280]  I start you know coming into more contact
[1:38:03.280 --> 1:38:05.280]  with these kids and stuff
[1:38:05.280 --> 1:38:07.280]  and it's worse than I thought
[1:38:07.280 --> 1:38:09.280]  like I said 30% of them
[1:38:09.280 --> 1:38:11.280]  are identifying as an opposite gender
[1:38:11.280 --> 1:38:13.280]  they want to change their name all the time
[1:38:13.280 --> 1:38:15.280]  well they tell them it's trendy and cool if they do it
[1:38:15.280 --> 1:38:17.280]  they take children
[1:38:17.280 --> 1:38:19.280]  who are ready to listen to the leadership
[1:38:19.280 --> 1:38:21.280]  and their teachers are telling them you're another gender
[1:38:21.280 --> 1:38:23.280]  and they're lining up for sterilization
[1:38:23.280 --> 1:38:25.280]  this is the real nightmare we're in
[1:38:25.280 --> 1:38:27.280]  so people ask me how do you handle the attacks
[1:38:27.280 --> 1:38:29.280]  how do you handle how bad this is
[1:38:29.280 --> 1:38:31.280]  you're really truly evil people
[1:38:33.280 --> 1:38:35.280]  yeah you're right they are
[1:38:35.280 --> 1:38:37.280]  and it's crazy and it's definitely a trend
[1:38:37.280 --> 1:38:39.280]  that's going on yeah and I don't know if the kids
[1:38:39.280 --> 1:38:41.280]  think it's trendy or cool or if they're super confused
[1:38:41.280 --> 1:38:43.280]  but either way it's not good
[1:38:43.280 --> 1:38:45.280]  it's bad
[1:38:45.280 --> 1:38:47.280]  God bless you bone crusher
[1:38:47.280 --> 1:38:49.280]  let's talk to Jason in Texas Jason go ahead
[1:38:51.280 --> 1:38:53.280]  I was just gonna say
[1:38:53.280 --> 1:38:55.280]  this is kind of a huge thing
[1:38:55.280 --> 1:38:57.280]  I mean most people don't talk about it
[1:38:57.280 --> 1:38:59.280]  but I went to the grocery store
[1:38:59.280 --> 1:39:01.280]  and I bought a few things not knowing
[1:39:01.280 --> 1:39:03.280]  I need to do better
[1:39:03.280 --> 1:39:05.280]  a lot of the things now
[1:39:05.280 --> 1:39:07.280]  products all say
[1:39:07.280 --> 1:39:09.280]  bioengineered chemicals
[1:39:09.280 --> 1:39:11.280]  it's not even real food they're giving us anymore
[1:39:11.280 --> 1:39:13.280]  I mean I can run down a quick
[1:39:13.280 --> 1:39:15.280]  list here of progressive soup
[1:39:15.280 --> 1:39:17.280]  Campbell's soup
[1:39:17.280 --> 1:39:19.280]  Kellogg's pita chip
[1:39:19.280 --> 1:39:21.280]  Prangles all say
[1:39:21.280 --> 1:39:23.280]  made with bioengineered
[1:39:23.280 --> 1:39:27.280]  chemicals
[1:39:27.280 --> 1:39:29.280]  and they're murdering us with this
[1:39:29.280 --> 1:39:31.280]  and we go pay our wages for it
[1:39:31.280 --> 1:39:33.280]  I went to the grocery store Saturday
[1:39:33.280 --> 1:39:35.280]  and I had been shopping myself in a few months
[1:39:35.280 --> 1:39:37.280]  and I
[1:39:37.280 --> 1:39:39.280]  we'll get some short ribs
[1:39:39.280 --> 1:39:41.280]  and cook them in the crock pot
[1:39:41.280 --> 1:39:43.280]  with garlic and stuff
[1:39:43.280 --> 1:39:45.280]  and normally 5 or 6, 7, 8 short ribs
[1:39:45.280 --> 1:39:47.280]  beef short ribs maybe
[1:39:47.280 --> 1:39:49.280]  20, 30 bucks
[1:39:49.280 --> 1:39:51.280]  when I got to the checkout it was $60
[1:39:51.280 --> 1:39:53.280]  I didn't even look
[1:39:53.280 --> 1:39:55.280]  I mean folks short ribs
[1:39:55.280 --> 1:39:57.280]  they threw away beef ribs
[1:39:57.280 --> 1:39:59.280]  and how can anybody
[1:39:59.280 --> 1:40:01.280]  pay that it's insane
[1:40:01.280 --> 1:40:03.280]  exactly
[1:40:03.280 --> 1:40:05.280]  they just throw it away anyway
[1:40:05.280 --> 1:40:07.280]  people really look
[1:40:07.280 --> 1:40:09.280]  at what you're buying
[1:40:09.280 --> 1:40:11.280]  read the ingredients
[1:40:11.280 --> 1:40:13.280]  I usually throw old bread
[1:40:13.280 --> 1:40:15.280]  something out to the birds
[1:40:15.280 --> 1:40:17.280]  I threw the Prangles out
[1:40:17.280 --> 1:40:19.280]  the birds didn't even touch it
[1:40:19.280 --> 1:40:21.280]  even more of the products
[1:40:21.280 --> 1:40:23.280]  are just devoid of any
[1:40:23.280 --> 1:40:25.280]  man I tell you
[1:40:25.280 --> 1:40:27.280]  I think you should make a list
[1:40:27.280 --> 1:40:29.280]  or have a video of
[1:40:29.280 --> 1:40:31.280]  I mean people call in
[1:40:31.280 --> 1:40:33.280]  or send videos or something at the store
[1:40:33.280 --> 1:40:35.280]  you'll see it right on almost
[1:40:35.280 --> 1:40:37.280]  every ingredient now
[1:40:37.280 --> 1:40:39.280]  well more and more products say
[1:40:39.280 --> 1:40:41.280]  cricket protein in them
[1:40:41.280 --> 1:40:43.280]  thank you so much sir I appreciate your call
[1:40:43.280 --> 1:40:45.280]  Steven in Florida you're on the air welcome
[1:40:45.280 --> 1:40:47.280]  hey good afternoon Alex
[1:40:47.280 --> 1:40:49.280]  I just wanted to
[1:40:49.280 --> 1:40:51.280]  jog your memory real quick
[1:40:51.280 --> 1:40:53.280]  2008 I called your show
[1:40:53.280 --> 1:40:55.280]  told you about a friend of mine
[1:40:55.280 --> 1:40:57.280]  who was a student at
[1:40:57.280 --> 1:40:59.280]  East Texas Baptist University
[1:40:59.280 --> 1:41:01.280]  that you ended up interviewing Jeffrey Staples
[1:41:01.280 --> 1:41:03.280]  and if you remember
[1:41:03.280 --> 1:41:05.280]  this is where he was interrogated by a couple
[1:41:05.280 --> 1:41:07.280]  of DHS thugs
[1:41:07.280 --> 1:41:09.280]  after he gave a tour to a bunch of boy scouts
[1:41:09.280 --> 1:41:11.280]  there and telling them to
[1:41:11.280 --> 1:41:13.280]  familiarize themselves with the Constitution
[1:41:13.280 --> 1:41:15.280]  and Bill of Rights
[1:41:15.280 --> 1:41:17.280]  and Declaration
[1:41:17.280 --> 1:41:19.280]  so I appreciate you doing that
[1:41:19.280 --> 1:41:21.280]  what I called about was this
[1:41:21.280 --> 1:41:23.280]  I've got a friend
[1:41:23.280 --> 1:41:25.280]  who works in the fertilizer industry
[1:41:25.280 --> 1:41:27.280]  he distributes and spreads
[1:41:27.280 --> 1:41:29.280]  fertilizer now
[1:41:29.280 --> 1:41:31.280]  he mentioned back when Obama was president
[1:41:31.280 --> 1:41:33.280]  he almost got put out of business
[1:41:33.280 --> 1:41:35.280]  because of his attack on the energy industry
[1:41:35.280 --> 1:41:37.280]  but he managed to survive
[1:41:37.280 --> 1:41:39.280]  but now
[1:41:39.280 --> 1:41:41.280]  with the prices of fertilizer going up
[1:41:41.280 --> 1:41:43.280]  of course he has to keep raising
[1:41:43.280 --> 1:41:45.280]  his prices
[1:41:45.280 --> 1:41:47.280]  so that's making it difficult
[1:41:47.280 --> 1:41:49.280]  but the other thing is he talked to him this morning
[1:41:49.280 --> 1:41:51.280]  and his diesel truck
[1:41:51.280 --> 1:41:53.280]  he said there's a part that broke down in the engine
[1:41:53.280 --> 1:41:55.280]  and
[1:41:55.280 --> 1:41:57.280]  he can't find that part anywhere
[1:41:57.280 --> 1:41:59.280]  and so
[1:41:59.280 --> 1:42:01.280]  a mechanic friend of his is helping him
[1:42:01.280 --> 1:42:03.280]  I guess try to fix the part
[1:42:03.280 --> 1:42:05.280]  oh yeah it's a total supply chain right now
[1:42:05.280 --> 1:42:07.280]  I mean this is
[1:42:07.280 --> 1:42:09.280]  the club of Rome, the Bilderberg group, the WFF
[1:42:09.280 --> 1:42:11.280]  said it was their plan
[1:42:11.280 --> 1:42:13.280]  25 years ago about this
[1:42:13.280 --> 1:42:15.280]  and now they're doing it
[1:42:15.280 --> 1:42:17.280]  that's what's crazy is we're living in the great
[1:42:17.280 --> 1:42:19.280]  reset, we're living in the post-industrial
[1:42:19.280 --> 1:42:21.280]  world and I don't think people realize
[1:42:21.280 --> 1:42:23.280]  how much trouble we're all in
[1:42:23.280 --> 1:42:25.280]  yeah so when I see these people
[1:42:25.280 --> 1:42:27.280]  doing these globalists

[1:47:33.280 --> 1:47:35.280]  it's only here because of the will
[1:47:35.280 --> 1:47:37.280]  of the people and their resistance
[1:47:37.280 --> 1:47:39.280]  and thank you for your
[1:47:39.280 --> 1:47:41.280]  steadfast defiance
[1:47:41.280 --> 1:47:43.280]  of tyranny
[1:47:43.280 --> 1:47:45.280]  Casey in South Carolina
[1:47:45.280 --> 1:47:47.280]  you're on the air
[1:47:47.280 --> 1:47:49.280]  hey Alex it's awesome to be on the radio
[1:47:49.280 --> 1:47:51.280]  we are on the internet
[1:47:51.280 --> 1:47:53.280]  we are on the air
[1:47:53.280 --> 1:47:55.280]  yes
[1:47:55.280 --> 1:47:57.280]  well you just said I'm from South Carolina
[1:47:57.280 --> 1:47:59.280]  and I'm gonna tell you why I think
[1:47:59.280 --> 1:48:01.280]  we need Trump to run instead of DeSantis
[1:48:01.280 --> 1:48:03.280]  we all know that
[1:48:03.280 --> 1:48:05.280]  Biden this is the state where he started
[1:48:05.280 --> 1:48:07.280]  to take over the democrat primary and all that
[1:48:07.280 --> 1:48:09.280]  and the reason for that
[1:48:09.280 --> 1:48:11.280]  I believe is because they could not have
[1:48:11.280 --> 1:48:13.280]  Bernie Sanders who was gonna win that primary
[1:48:13.280 --> 1:48:15.280]  they couldn't have him run
[1:48:15.280 --> 1:48:17.280]  and get away with the steal
[1:48:17.280 --> 1:48:19.280]  and I think in 2024
[1:48:19.280 --> 1:48:21.280]  we do not have Trump
[1:48:21.280 --> 1:48:23.280]  as the candidate for the Republicans
[1:48:23.280 --> 1:48:25.280]  there
[1:48:25.280 --> 1:48:27.280]  I don't think there's any way DeSantis can win
[1:48:27.280 --> 1:48:29.280]  that he will win
[1:48:29.280 --> 1:48:31.280]  because it would be easier
[1:48:31.280 --> 1:48:33.280]  for them to get Biden elected
[1:48:33.280 --> 1:48:35.280]  with another steal over DeSantis
[1:48:35.280 --> 1:48:37.280]  and be able to say hey
[1:48:37.280 --> 1:48:39.280]  Biden won over DeSantis
[1:48:39.280 --> 1:48:41.280]  it'll be harder for them to beat
[1:48:41.280 --> 1:48:43.280]  Trump again with a steal
[1:48:43.280 --> 1:48:45.280]  because he has all his star power
[1:48:45.280 --> 1:48:47.280]  and he just still has all the support
[1:48:47.280 --> 1:48:49.280]  and that's why we need him to run
[1:48:49.280 --> 1:48:51.280]  instead of DeSantis
[1:48:51.280 --> 1:48:53.280]  Well I know this, they're certainly scared of Trump
[1:48:53.280 --> 1:48:55.280]  and I still support Trump despite the vaccine garbage
[1:48:55.280 --> 1:48:57.280]  because I don't understand him
[1:48:57.280 --> 1:48:59.280]  Yes, he needs to fix that
[1:48:59.280 --> 1:49:01.280]  but overall
[1:49:01.280 --> 1:49:03.280]  he's still our best option in 2024
[1:49:03.280 --> 1:49:05.280]  I totally agree with that
[1:49:05.280 --> 1:49:07.280]  and I love DeSantis, don't get me wrong
[1:49:07.280 --> 1:49:09.280]  but I don't think he could have the support
[1:49:09.280 --> 1:49:11.280]  but he cannot get the kind of support
[1:49:11.280 --> 1:49:13.280]  that Trump will get
[1:49:13.280 --> 1:49:15.280]  Well the system is definitely scared of Trump
[1:49:15.280 --> 1:49:17.280]  and all these fake courts
[1:49:17.280 --> 1:49:19.280]  and all these investigations
[1:49:19.280 --> 1:49:21.280]  it's just insane trying to keep voters
[1:49:21.280 --> 1:49:23.280]  from having the candidate they want
[1:49:23.280 --> 1:49:25.280]  Thank you Casey, Vidal in Nebraska

[1:49:35.280 --> 1:49:37.280]  Alex, these are the lyrics

[1:49:51.280 --> 1:49:53.280]  now cancelling
[1:49:53.280 --> 1:49:55.280]  basically how they were the type
[1:49:55.280 --> 1:49:57.280]  and have led everybody off
[1:49:57.280 --> 1:49:59.280]  on a moral
[1:49:59.280 --> 1:50:01.280]  waterfall

[1:50:05.280 --> 1:50:07.280]  with Vidal and the shadowy figures

[1:50:35.280 --> 1:50:37.280]  a big star

[1:50:45.280 --> 1:50:47.280]  to meet with General Flynn
[1:50:47.280 --> 1:50:49.280]  my wife's family lives there
[1:50:49.280 --> 1:50:51.280]  we go there at least twice a year
[1:50:51.280 --> 1:50:53.280]  they made this big conspiracy
[1:50:53.280 --> 1:50:55.280]  while we were in Omaha
[1:50:55.280 --> 1:50:57.280]  yes, meanwhile, you had this large judgment
[1:50:57.280 --> 1:50:59.280]  against you and then it was
[1:50:59.280 --> 1:51:01.280]  oh, he stays at the most expensive hotel
[1:51:01.280 --> 1:51:03.280]  in Omaha
[1:51:03.280 --> 1:51:05.280]  $150 a night
[1:51:05.280 --> 1:51:07.280]  oh my god
[1:51:07.280 --> 1:51:09.280]  well, it was great
[1:51:09.280 --> 1:51:11.280]  I could feel the force
[1:51:11.280 --> 1:51:13.280]  because that's when the creativity started on that song
[1:51:13.280 --> 1:51:15.280]  and then now here it is
[1:51:15.280 --> 1:51:17.280]  it is born and it's ready for the public
[1:51:17.280 --> 1:51:19.280]  to hear and to make Vidal and the shadowy figures
[1:51:19.280 --> 1:51:21.280]  just another Hydrahead
[1:51:21.280 --> 1:51:23.280]  in the
[1:51:23.280 --> 1:51:25.280]  Vidal, I'll look it up, thank you
[1:51:25.280 --> 1:51:27.280]  I really appreciate your call
[1:51:27.280 --> 1:51:29.280]  let's go ahead and take another call
[1:51:29.280 --> 1:51:31.280]  Carlos in Texas, go ahead, you're on there
[1:51:31.280 --> 1:51:33.280]  yeah, I just get to be on the show with you again
[1:51:33.280 --> 1:51:35.280]  I talked to you a couple weeks ago
[1:51:35.280 --> 1:51:37.280]  about
[1:51:37.280 --> 1:51:39.280]  you being from that show First Wave
[1:51:39.280 --> 1:51:41.280]  they're having daily meetings
[1:51:41.280 --> 1:51:43.280]  about you, Alex
[1:51:43.280 --> 1:51:45.280]  they are running scared
[1:51:45.280 --> 1:51:47.280]  they are
[1:51:47.280 --> 1:51:49.280]  not going after conservatives
[1:51:49.280 --> 1:51:51.280]  and the things we like most
[1:51:51.280 --> 1:51:53.280]  which are weapons and this kind of had me thinking
[1:51:53.280 --> 1:51:55.280]  Alex, if they're going to
[1:51:55.280 --> 1:51:57.280]  put a new classification
[1:51:57.280 --> 1:51:59.280]  on the weapons
[1:51:59.280 --> 1:52:01.280]  don't you think they already have a classification
[1:52:01.280 --> 1:52:03.280]  for people, which might be
[1:52:03.280 --> 1:52:05.280]  oh, that's a social credit score
[1:52:05.280 --> 1:52:07.280]  yeah, oh, you go through a background check
[1:52:07.280 --> 1:52:09.280]  to buy a gun but now Visa and MasterCard
[1:52:09.280 --> 1:52:11.280]  puts their own database at the UN
[1:52:11.280 --> 1:52:13.280]  the UN through the big banks
[1:52:13.280 --> 1:52:15.280]  is creating a register of American gun owners
[1:52:15.280 --> 1:52:17.280]  or people that buy gun accessories
[1:52:17.280 --> 1:52:19.280]  where is congress, where are the governors
[1:52:19.280 --> 1:52:21.280]  that is criminal
[1:52:21.280 --> 1:52:23.280]  they are owned
[1:52:23.280 --> 1:52:25.280]  by Visa, MasterCard and all these big bankers
[1:52:25.280 --> 1:52:27.280]  now the other part
[1:52:27.280 --> 1:52:29.280]  of the great
[1:52:29.280 --> 1:52:31.280]  reset that's coming up next
[1:52:31.280 --> 1:52:33.280]  is the part
[1:52:33.280 --> 1:52:35.280]  that you so very well put
[1:52:35.280 --> 1:52:37.280]  here a couple months ago
[1:52:37.280 --> 1:52:39.280]  about Dennis Meadows talking about
[1:52:39.280 --> 1:52:41.280]  how the suffering is going to be
[1:52:41.280 --> 1:52:43.280]  equal among all parties
[1:52:43.280 --> 1:52:45.280]  not everybody is going to be happy
[1:52:45.280 --> 1:52:47.280]  but everybody is going to be
[1:52:47.280 --> 1:52:49.280]  equally I guess suffering
[1:52:49.280 --> 1:52:51.280]  or equally dead or I don't know what he meant by that
[1:52:51.280 --> 1:52:53.280]  but I'm pretty sure we can all read
[1:52:53.280 --> 1:52:55.280]  between the lines of what he meant
[1:52:55.280 --> 1:52:57.280]  so that's the part that's coming in with the cold
[1:52:57.280 --> 1:52:59.280]  weather
[1:52:59.280 --> 1:53:01.280]  this summer going into the cold weather
[1:53:01.280 --> 1:53:03.280]  they're going to do us like the way they did us
[1:53:03.280 --> 1:53:05.280]  down in Texas whenever they shut off
[1:53:05.280 --> 1:53:07.280]  the power on us
[1:53:07.280 --> 1:53:09.280]  that's what they want
[1:53:09.280 --> 1:53:11.280]  brother they're already doing it in Europe
[1:53:11.280 --> 1:53:13.280]  they're already doing it everywhere I mean they are
[1:53:13.280 --> 1:53:15.280]  saying it's a great transition we're cutting your power off
[1:53:15.280 --> 1:53:17.280]  I mean the crime
[1:53:17.280 --> 1:53:19.280]  they're committing is insane Carlos thank you so much
[1:53:19.280 --> 1:53:21.280]  Nick and Uncle Homa, Nick go ahead
[1:53:21.280 --> 1:53:23.280]  we're going Mr. Alex
[1:53:23.280 --> 1:53:25.280]  nice to be on the air with you
[1:53:25.280 --> 1:53:27.280]  yes sir
[1:53:27.280 --> 1:53:29.280]  so I had something brought to my attention
[1:53:29.280 --> 1:53:31.280]  yesterday
[1:53:31.280 --> 1:53:33.280]  the potential of strikes going on
[1:53:33.280 --> 1:53:35.280]  with certain shipping companies
[1:53:35.280 --> 1:53:37.280]  FedEx, UPS
[1:53:37.280 --> 1:53:39.280]  and then as soon as I did that
[1:53:39.280 --> 1:53:41.280]  as soon as I got that notification
[1:53:41.280 --> 1:53:43.280]  I jump on your website
[1:53:43.280 --> 1:53:45.280]  and yesterday evening
[1:53:45.280 --> 1:53:47.280]  and I see where the trains are going with strike
[1:53:47.280 --> 1:53:49.280]  so
[1:53:49.280 --> 1:53:51.280]  my thing about this is
[1:53:51.280 --> 1:53:53.280]  look at all of
[1:53:53.280 --> 1:53:55.280]  their refinery plants
[1:53:55.280 --> 1:53:57.280]  that have been
[1:53:57.280 --> 1:53:59.280]  all these accidents
[1:53:59.280 --> 1:54:01.280]  at these refinery plants
[1:54:01.280 --> 1:54:03.280]  the line blowing up down in Louisiana
[1:54:03.280 --> 1:54:05.280]  power plants are blowing up
[1:54:05.280 --> 1:54:07.280]  cutting off pipelines
[1:54:07.280 --> 1:54:09.280]  banning new drilling permits
[1:54:09.280 --> 1:54:11.280]  all the hundreds of
[1:54:11.280 --> 1:54:13.280]  food processing plants are blowing up
[1:54:13.280 --> 1:54:15.280]  it's pretty obvious what's happening
[1:54:15.280 --> 1:54:17.280]  so
[1:54:17.280 --> 1:54:19.280]  I guess my thing is
[1:54:19.280 --> 1:54:21.280]  I think people really need to take stock
[1:54:21.280 --> 1:54:23.280]  of what they have
[1:54:23.280 --> 1:54:25.280]  what they don't
[1:54:25.280 --> 1:54:27.280]  definitely go to infowarstore.com
[1:54:27.280 --> 1:54:29.280]  I've been a long time
[1:54:29.280 --> 1:54:31.280]  listener and I've been a recent
[1:54:31.280 --> 1:54:33.280]  first time purchaser
[1:54:33.280 --> 1:54:35.280]  because brother we're fighting just to stay on there
[1:54:35.280 --> 1:54:37.280]  I think we're a critical infrastructure so thank you
[1:54:37.280 --> 1:54:39.280]  oh man
[1:54:39.280 --> 1:54:41.280]  and the X-12
[1:54:41.280 --> 1:54:43.280]  I started taking that X-12
[1:54:43.280 --> 1:54:45.280]  the iodine
[1:54:45.280 --> 1:54:47.280]  I'll be honest with you I'm a little bit brave
[1:54:47.280 --> 1:54:49.280]  I guess I've been putting it directly underneath the tongue
[1:54:49.280 --> 1:54:51.280]  and
[1:54:51.280 --> 1:54:53.280]  it's completely changed everything
[1:54:53.280 --> 1:54:55.280]  my energy, my focus, brain force
[1:54:55.280 --> 1:54:57.280]  plus, bodies
[1:54:57.280 --> 1:54:59.280]  I'm a heavier sick guy
[1:54:59.280 --> 1:55:01.280]  I'm a truck driver so I don't get a lot of exercise
[1:55:01.280 --> 1:55:03.280]  and all of these supplements
[1:55:03.280 --> 1:55:05.280]  that I've recently purchased from
[1:55:05.280 --> 1:55:07.280]  started taking it's completely
[1:55:07.280 --> 1:55:09.280]  changed my life around
[1:55:09.280 --> 1:55:11.280]  I was drinking five or six of the big
[1:55:11.280 --> 1:55:13.280]  monster energy drinks a day
[1:55:13.280 --> 1:55:15.280]  a day I was drinking those
[1:55:15.280 --> 1:55:17.280]  and now I'm not drinking those anymore
[1:55:17.280 --> 1:55:19.280]  I don't need those
[1:55:19.280 --> 1:55:21.280]  I'm really focused behind the wheel
[1:55:21.280 --> 1:55:23.280]  I'm awake, I'm alert
[1:55:23.280 --> 1:55:25.280]  it's completely changed my life around
[1:55:25.280 --> 1:55:27.280]  I can't wait until I get some turbo force
[1:55:27.280 --> 1:55:29.280]  that's my next big purchase
[1:55:29.280 --> 1:55:31.280]  and definitely as previous callers have stated
[1:55:31.280 --> 1:55:33.280]  by the book
[1:55:33.280 --> 1:55:35.280]  send it out as gifts because it's worth
[1:55:35.280 --> 1:55:37.280]  every penny
[1:55:37.280 --> 1:55:39.280]  well we're leaking on more, I mean the products are great
[1:55:39.280 --> 1:55:41.280]  I appreciate people getting them but
[1:55:41.280 --> 1:55:43.280]  we have to run our own ban with our own uplinks
[1:55:43.280 --> 1:55:45.280]  our own lawyers, our own shipping
[1:55:45.280 --> 1:55:47.280]  our own infrastructure
[1:55:47.280 --> 1:55:49.280]  we have been debanked, we have been shut down
[1:55:49.280 --> 1:55:51.280]  and so we have to pay higher credit card
[1:55:51.280 --> 1:55:53.280]  rates, everything and I'm not whining
[1:55:53.280 --> 1:55:55.280]  we're in a war and it is literally
[1:55:55.280 --> 1:55:57.280]  great people like you Nick

[1:56:05.280 --> 1:56:07.280]  the more you feel about these ultimate turmeric formula
[1:56:07.280 --> 1:56:09.280]  or a vitamin mineral fusion

[1:56:11.280 --> 1:56:13.280]  or an X3 or something like that
[1:56:13.280 --> 1:56:15.280]  the more you feel it

[2:01:07.280 --> 2:01:09.280]  mostly modern day times
[2:01:09.280 --> 2:01:11.280]  9-11
[2:01:11.280 --> 2:01:13.280]  was
[2:01:13.280 --> 2:01:15.280]  the first real
[2:01:15.280 --> 2:01:17.280]  what most people can remember
[2:01:17.280 --> 2:01:19.280]  is the big fall the big flag
[2:01:19.280 --> 2:01:21.280]  out there
[2:01:21.280 --> 2:01:23.280]  2008
[2:01:23.280 --> 2:01:25.280]  collapsed
[2:01:25.280 --> 2:01:27.280]  and then the race war that Obama
[2:01:27.280 --> 2:01:29.280]  started and then covid
[2:01:29.280 --> 2:01:31.280]  what's coming next
[2:01:31.280 --> 2:01:33.280]  well I tell you what
[2:01:33.280 --> 2:01:35.280]  let me touch on this real quick
[2:01:35.280 --> 2:01:37.280]  Delray Beach Florida
[2:01:37.280 --> 2:01:39.280]  where I had one of my stores
[2:01:39.280 --> 2:01:41.280]  in a large gym down there on Atlantic Avenue
[2:01:41.280 --> 2:01:43.280]  this is where
[2:01:43.280 --> 2:01:45.280]  a couple of the other guys
[2:01:45.280 --> 2:01:47.280]  they were supposedly flying
[2:01:47.280 --> 2:01:49.280]  those planes into
[2:01:49.280 --> 2:01:51.280]  9-11 into the buildings
[2:01:51.280 --> 2:01:53.280]  I wasn't
[2:01:53.280 --> 2:01:55.280]  fully fully awake at the time
[2:01:55.280 --> 2:01:57.280]  they had these phone numbers
[2:01:57.280 --> 2:01:59.280]  they were putting out there on the news
[2:01:59.280 --> 2:02:01.280]  called this FBI number
[2:02:01.280 --> 2:02:03.280]  if you have any tips
[2:02:03.280 --> 2:02:05.280]  several days after 9-11
[2:02:05.280 --> 2:02:07.280]  I said hey this guy is hanging out
[2:02:07.280 --> 2:02:09.280]  here
[2:02:09.280 --> 2:02:11.280]  some Middle Eastern guys
[2:02:11.280 --> 2:02:13.280]  that own this
[2:02:13.280 --> 2:02:15.280]  7-11 type store
[2:02:15.280 --> 2:02:17.280]  on Atlantic Avenue
[2:02:17.280 --> 2:02:19.280]  they blew me off
[2:02:19.280 --> 2:02:21.280]  nothing
[2:02:21.280 --> 2:02:23.280]  now
[2:02:23.280 --> 2:02:25.280]  that was in September
[2:02:25.280 --> 2:02:27.280]  in January
[2:02:27.280 --> 2:02:29.280]  that guy they call ATA
[2:02:29.280 --> 2:02:31.280]  signed his gym membership
[2:02:31.280 --> 2:02:33.280]  for the following year
[2:02:33.280 --> 2:02:35.280]  his new gym membership for the year
[2:02:35.280 --> 2:02:37.280]  in January
[2:02:37.280 --> 2:02:39.280]  my friend's wife
[2:02:39.280 --> 2:02:41.280]  was the membership director
[2:02:41.280 --> 2:02:43.280]  there and before she left
[2:02:43.280 --> 2:02:45.280]  her job after
[2:02:45.280 --> 2:02:47.280]  another year or so
[2:02:47.280 --> 2:02:49.280]  she took that coffee
[2:02:49.280 --> 2:02:51.280]  so she has the coffee
[2:02:51.280 --> 2:02:53.280]  dated and signed
[2:02:53.280 --> 2:02:55.280]  by ATA
[2:02:55.280 --> 2:02:57.280]  so
[2:02:57.280 --> 2:02:59.280]  this whole thing was such
[2:02:59.280 --> 2:03:01.280]  such a farce
[2:03:01.280 --> 2:03:03.280]  but
[2:03:03.280 --> 2:03:05.280]  what do I think is coming next
[2:03:05.280 --> 2:03:07.280]  well I'll tell you what
[2:03:07.280 --> 2:03:09.280]  it's tough
[2:03:09.280 --> 2:03:11.280]  I think all of these things
[2:03:11.280 --> 2:03:13.280]  first of all I think
[2:03:13.280 --> 2:03:15.280]  Trump
[2:03:15.280 --> 2:03:17.280]  is 10 steps ahead of everybody
[2:03:17.280 --> 2:03:19.280]  I think he pretty much knew
[2:03:19.280 --> 2:03:21.280]  that this search on Mar-a-Lago
[2:03:21.280 --> 2:03:23.280]  was going to happen
[2:03:23.280 --> 2:03:25.280]  etc. I think he only
[2:03:25.280 --> 2:03:27.280]  put in there what he wanted
[2:03:27.280 --> 2:03:29.280]  these clowns to find
[2:03:29.280 --> 2:03:31.280]  I know there's been
[2:03:31.280 --> 2:03:33.280]  a lot of talks about his attempts
[2:03:33.280 --> 2:03:35.280]  on his life again which there always is
[2:03:35.280 --> 2:03:37.280]  you know
[2:03:37.280 --> 2:03:39.280]  how they're closing everything down
[2:03:39.280 --> 2:03:41.280]  blowing up these food processing
[2:03:41.280 --> 2:03:43.280]  plans now with the railway system
[2:03:43.280 --> 2:03:45.280]  going on strike
[2:03:45.280 --> 2:03:47.280]  for delivery
[2:03:47.280 --> 2:03:49.280]  the trucks like Caller mentioned earlier
[2:03:49.280 --> 2:03:51.280]  parts to keep these things on the road
[2:03:51.280 --> 2:03:53.280]  now you're going to have the diesel
[2:03:53.280 --> 2:03:55.280]  fuel
[2:03:55.280 --> 2:03:57.280]  the oil for the diesel fuel
[2:03:57.280 --> 2:03:59.280]  is really going to be scarce
[2:03:59.280 --> 2:04:01.280]  yeah it's a
[2:04:01.280 --> 2:04:03.280]  an inner
[2:04:03.280 --> 2:04:05.280]  to outer breakdown
[2:04:05.280 --> 2:04:07.280]  of the whole structure
[2:04:07.280 --> 2:04:09.280]  and so
[2:04:09.280 --> 2:04:11.280]  I think
[2:04:11.280 --> 2:04:13.280]  you know of course
[2:04:13.280 --> 2:04:15.280]  we're going to stay tough
[2:04:15.280 --> 2:04:17.280]  do what we can not fall for this garbage
[2:04:17.280 --> 2:04:19.280]  as far
[2:04:19.280 --> 2:04:21.280]  as Trump and all this covid
[2:04:21.280 --> 2:04:23.280]  this speed warp speed
[2:04:23.280 --> 2:04:25.280]  stuff I have no idea
[2:04:25.280 --> 2:04:27.280]  how he's going to get out of there because
[2:04:27.280 --> 2:04:29.280]  if he doesn't
[2:04:29.280 --> 2:04:31.280]  he's going to lose what is it 25
[2:04:31.280 --> 2:04:33.280]  30% I hear you we're out of time
[2:04:33.280 --> 2:04:35.280]  Greg thanks for the call
[2:04:35.280 --> 2:04:37.280]  look we can bet on Trump all day he's not going to
[2:04:37.280 --> 2:04:39.280]  save us we're going to save ourselves with God's help
[2:04:39.280 --> 2:04:41.280]  but make no mistake that this ran a giant
[2:04:41.280 --> 2:04:43.280]  chemical biological attack with these shots
[2:04:43.280 --> 2:04:45.280]  they're testing mass calling
[2:04:45.280 --> 2:04:47.280]  to see if we'll accept it
[2:04:47.280 --> 2:04:49.280]  if we don't wake up and say no to this
[2:04:49.280 --> 2:04:51.280]  they're going to launch the next big attack
[2:04:51.280 --> 2:04:53.280]  under Peter Braggen is our guest straight ahead
[2:04:53.280 --> 2:04:55.280]  stay with us
[2:04:57.280 --> 2:04:59.280]  people ask me all the time
[2:04:59.280 --> 2:05:01.280]  what is your best new tropic
[2:05:01.280 --> 2:05:03.280]  you've got turbo force
[2:05:03.280 --> 2:05:05.280]  you've got brain force plus
[2:05:05.280 --> 2:05:07.280]  and you've got brain force ultra
[2:05:07.280 --> 2:05:09.280]  which one is better
[2:05:09.280 --> 2:05:11.280]  and that's like asking
[2:05:11.280 --> 2:05:13.280]  what's better a Ford F-150
[2:05:13.280 --> 2:05:15.280]  or a Cadillac
[2:05:15.280 --> 2:05:17.280]  or a Ferrari
[2:05:17.280 --> 2:05:19.280]  it's different strokes for different folks
[2:05:19.280 --> 2:05:21.280]  it varies
[2:05:21.280 --> 2:05:23.280]  all three are different formulas
[2:05:23.280 --> 2:05:25.280]  all three do different things
[2:05:25.280 --> 2:05:27.280]  turbo force is 10 hours of clean
[2:05:27.280 --> 2:05:29.280]  out of control energy
[2:05:29.280 --> 2:05:31.280]  I can't even take a whole pack myself
[2:05:31.280 --> 2:05:33.280]  brain force plus is a

[2:05:41.280 --> 2:05:43.280]  that creates incredible clarity
[2:05:43.280 --> 2:05:45.280]  and lasts very long
[2:05:45.280 --> 2:05:47.280]  they're all three different formulas

[2:05:57.280 --> 2:06:15.280]  First Recording
[2:06:15.280 --> 2:06:42.180]  All right, Dr. Peter Brigham is an extremely respected psychiatrist who's been a top
[2:06:42.180 --> 2:06:47.120]  national news pundit. He's a guy that warned against all these psychotropic drugs, triggering
[2:06:47.120 --> 2:06:54.220]  suicide and mass death. And he has literally been a leading light against tyranny until
[2:06:54.220 --> 2:06:59.040]  about 15 years ago when the system got totally taken over. He got blackball. He's written
[2:06:59.040 --> 2:07:07.560]  a bestselling book dealing with COVID-19, bregon.com, B-R-E-G-G-I-N, or we are the prey.com
[2:07:07.560 --> 2:07:11.360]  is the name of the book that came out over a year ago that is dead on. I wanted to get
[2:07:11.360 --> 2:07:17.280]  him on, not about the controversy with him alone and, you know, Professor Desmond and
[2:07:17.280 --> 2:07:21.120]  the mass formations. We know that went on. The question is, was it deliberate or not?
[2:07:21.120 --> 2:07:24.160]  That's a side issue. He's welcome to cover that and get into it. I've wanted to get him
[2:07:24.160 --> 2:07:28.720]  on for like a couple months. And finally, I'm not mad at the producers. They finally
[2:07:28.720 --> 2:07:38.440]  called him and got him on. But there's no reason to weigh in on whether the mass formation
[2:07:38.440 --> 2:07:43.600]  was designed or not. I have hundreds and I'm going to show you BBC, on a telegraph, Toronto
[2:07:43.600 --> 2:07:48.520]  newspaper, national posts, Washington posts, all saying it was a psychological operation
[2:07:48.520 --> 2:07:54.320]  run by the militaries of the West under direction by the W.E.F. So I don't even see why there's
[2:07:54.320 --> 2:07:59.200]  a controversy. I'm just glad people are exposing mass formation and the people like Dr. Bregen
[2:07:59.200 --> 2:08:04.600]  take you to the next level of how it was done by design. But I want to talk about all these
[2:08:04.600 --> 2:08:11.160]  studies coming out by the New England Medical Journal and Lansett and others confirming 98
[2:08:11.160 --> 2:08:17.320]  times worse effects of the shot than the virus. And just what this means for me, I don't have
[2:08:17.320 --> 2:08:21.280]  a psychology degree. I'm not a psychiatrist. I don't have a PhD, but I can just see without
[2:08:21.280 --> 2:08:28.240]  even terms how we're being prepared and ready for horrors and just being normalized to cause
[2:08:28.240 --> 2:08:34.360]  this mass death. And so Dr. Bregen, it's great to have you. You can start. Dr. Peter, our
[2:08:34.360 --> 2:08:41.760]  Bregen MD, medical doctor, psychiatrist, you can start wherever you want here and just basically
[2:08:41.760 --> 2:08:46.920]  have the floor of this hour. But I mean, it's amazing how vindicated you are and how vindicated
[2:08:46.920 --> 2:08:50.360]  all of us are. We don't want to be vindicated. We wish this never would have happened. But
[2:08:50.360 --> 2:08:55.520]  how were you able to predict it two years ago? How could I predict it? How could Dr. Francis
[2:08:55.520 --> 2:09:00.640]  Boyle predict it two and a half years ago? And then, and then now we're here and I get
[2:09:00.640 --> 2:09:04.520]  your point when I saw you on air. I love Joe Rogan at dinner with him a couple of weeks
[2:09:04.520 --> 2:09:09.280]  ago, but I saw him on air right before we had dinner a few days before. And he's like,
[2:09:09.280 --> 2:09:14.160]  well, all we can hope for is they don't do it again. No, we better prosecute and expose
[2:09:14.160 --> 2:09:19.280]  because they are planning it again. And so the waterfront needs to be covered here. Obviously,
[2:09:19.280 --> 2:09:24.640]  this is a societal takeover. This is the number one issue of the biomedical state using fear
[2:09:24.640 --> 2:09:29.800]  for control. So where do you want to start today? Dr. Peter Bregen.
[2:09:29.800 --> 2:09:38.040]  I think one of the biggest points is that COVID-19 was the coming out party in a way
[2:09:38.040 --> 2:09:44.600]  for the global predators. It was the first time that they made themselves so obvious,
[2:09:44.600 --> 2:09:51.040]  the first time that they made so clear that they are anti-American, that they have to
[2:09:51.040 --> 2:09:59.080]  destroy America, set it at their conferences. It's the first time that we got a chance,
[2:09:59.080 --> 2:10:06.960]  those of us unlike you who had not been studying this for decades, got a chance to look behind
[2:10:06.960 --> 2:10:16.680]  the curtain. And I saw a film of you about, I don't know, 20 years ago. You look quite
[2:10:16.680 --> 2:10:26.640]  young like I did 20 years ago. And you were saying all of the fundamental principles that
[2:10:26.640 --> 2:10:38.040]  I struggled so hard to rediscover when I was just tracking COVID-19. First of all, I want
[2:10:38.040 --> 2:10:44.360]  to say it was amazing, the clarity with which you were describing the globalists so long
[2:10:44.360 --> 2:10:53.160]  ago and so alone. The other thing I wanted to say is congratulations on having a tremendous
[2:10:53.160 --> 2:11:01.760]  bestseller that is actually outselling the New York Times bestseller. So we are in an
[2:11:01.760 --> 2:11:08.320]  alternative reality with our alternative institutions. And again, you were developing
[2:11:08.320 --> 2:11:15.960]  that concept of being an alternative institution a long time ago. And it's a good book. Your
[2:11:15.960 --> 2:11:27.880]  book is a very sound book. It's a very realistic book. It is in no way, you know, the kind
[2:11:27.880 --> 2:11:33.640]  of book that they imagined you would write on the progress of the lab.
[2:11:33.640 --> 2:11:37.080]  Well, thank you, Dr. Bregan. You were very nice the last time you were on. I appreciate
[2:11:37.080 --> 2:11:41.560]  your kind words, but you are a medical doctor, psychiatrist, and we're one of the main leading
[2:11:41.560 --> 2:11:45.680]  lives of the last few decades exposing psychotrophics. You were totally vindicated. So using your
[2:11:45.680 --> 2:11:51.280]  brain to gravitas, what really happened? Where are we currently? How do we counter this?
[2:11:51.280 --> 2:11:58.480]  I think that there are several things people need to realize. One is that there are predatory
[2:11:58.480 --> 2:12:06.640]  people who do not operate on the same principles we operate on. These people, whether it's
[2:12:06.640 --> 2:12:19.200]  Fauci or Klaus Schwab or George Soros or Bill Gates or Tedros or Xi Jinping, they do not
[2:12:19.200 --> 2:12:28.320]  operate the way we do. They do not have ethical and moral barriers that they think about on
[2:12:28.320 --> 2:12:36.200]  a regular basis and how they relate to the world, to their job, to their work.
[2:12:36.200 --> 2:12:43.200]  The average man who's doing plumbing job or doing mechanics and so on has a real ethical
[2:12:43.200 --> 2:12:49.080]  code. He's not just looking at the car or the plumbing and saying, how do I make the
[2:12:49.080 --> 2:12:56.320]  most possible money out of this, get as much control over this customer so they can't imagine
[2:12:56.320 --> 2:13:02.040]  seeing anybody else, scare the living daylights out of them so they'll let me do all kinds
[2:13:02.040 --> 2:13:08.640]  of preventive measures. Human beings just don't naturally think this way because we
[2:13:08.640 --> 2:13:15.760]  are a very social being. We owe our huge strength to our ability to look out for each other,
[2:13:15.760 --> 2:13:22.360]  cover each other's backs. I mean, we couldn't have taken down mastodomes with pointed sticks
[2:13:22.360 --> 2:13:28.720]  if the men weren't working really closely together and looking out for each other. We
[2:13:28.720 --> 2:13:35.600]  couldn't have raised infants under the conditions of being nomadic people without loving each
[2:13:35.600 --> 2:13:41.560]  other and loving our babies, taking care of them in ways we don't even do anymore.
[2:13:41.560 --> 2:13:50.240]  We couldn't have gone out and hunted and gathered berries and fruits and things from the ground
[2:13:50.240 --> 2:13:55.680]  and brought them back if we weren't cooperating and looking out for each other. It's hard
[2:13:55.680 --> 2:14:06.040]  for us to get the truth about what we are facing and what we are facing are people who have
[2:14:06.040 --> 2:14:16.320]  no ethical, moral, political, nationalistic restraints. They are devoid of the usual identifications
[2:14:16.320 --> 2:14:22.600]  that we think about. Soros may for a time have called himself an America, but he hates
[2:14:22.600 --> 2:14:31.600]  America. Bill Gates is putting everything ahead of America. So are all of the globalists.
[2:14:31.600 --> 2:14:38.080]  What happened when Trump ran for office was he very quickly announced that he was for
[2:14:38.080 --> 2:14:44.680]  America first. He's America firster. That's what got people enraged at him. It wasn't
[2:14:44.680 --> 2:14:52.040]  his yellow hair or his non-political manner. It wasn't his acting like a good old boy,
[2:14:52.040 --> 2:14:59.440]  which he is in his heart in many ways, or like a contractor or a builder, which he is.
[2:14:59.440 --> 2:15:04.800]  It wasn't any of that. That was all nonsense. They were going to impeach him before he won
[2:15:04.800 --> 2:15:12.560]  the presidency. It was very much about what you've been talking about for all these years.
[2:15:12.560 --> 2:15:20.480]  It was about the world economic forum, globalism. I don't know how deeply Trump understood globalism,
[2:15:20.480 --> 2:15:26.160]  what he announced in response to the Koch brothers not wanting to support him in his
[2:15:26.160 --> 2:15:31.280]  difficult way. They're really nice guys, but I don't need them. I don't want them. He
[2:15:31.280 --> 2:15:38.160]  said they're globalists. So he understood that. So I want people, right now, I think
[2:15:38.160 --> 2:15:43.280]  one of the major contributions I can make from my psychiatric background, and by the
[2:15:43.280 --> 2:15:49.320]  way, Alex, I've been a medical expert in multiple mass murder cases, including some
[2:15:49.320 --> 2:15:53.160]  of them. You're renowned. Stay right there, doctor. We'll come back and talk about it
[2:15:53.160 --> 2:15:57.560]  all straight ahead.
[2:15:57.560 --> 2:16:02.360]  Everybody knows that high quality fish oil does fantastic things for your cardiovascular
[2:16:02.360 --> 2:16:07.920]  system, for your brain, for every part of your body. But what I don't see being promote
[2:16:07.920 --> 2:16:15.800]  is the fact that it has natural psychotropic effects. It certainly does for me. When I
[2:16:15.800 --> 2:16:21.720]  take a couple of these capsules an hour before bed, my sleep, my dreams are amazing. Now
[2:16:21.720 --> 2:16:27.600]  there are actually some studies out there linking it to amazing events in the brain.
[2:16:27.600 --> 2:16:32.120]  But I want you to experience it yourself. We know it's good for your heart. We know
[2:16:32.120 --> 2:16:35.800]  it's good for your brain. We know it's good for your arteries and veins and your lungs
[2:16:35.800 --> 2:16:40.280]  and every other function of your body. But I want you to experience this high grade fish

[2:17:10.640 --> 2:17:15.560]  now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[2:18:24.480 --> 2:18:29.000]  than 40% of the U.S. alone. Some areas of the world are up over 100%. The only way you

[2:18:56.600 --> 2:19:03.680]  Get our great bag of it here. I mean this is from people say why is it from Chiapas,
[2:19:03.680 --> 2:19:07.920]  Mexico, the communists. Well that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's
[2:19:07.920 --> 2:19:13.400]  wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil better than Guatemalan coffee and yeah
[2:19:13.400 --> 2:19:16.640]  we buy it from the little farmers that you know the media calls communists but really
[2:19:16.640 --> 2:19:20.440]  they're just a commune and whatever the point is is that it's good coffee and we've got
[2:19:20.440 --> 2:19:23.560]  it and the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over so I actually buy this
[2:19:23.560 --> 2:19:26.880]  from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for what 14 years and the price has never
[2:19:26.880 --> 2:19:30.920]  gone up. The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per
[2:19:30.920 --> 2:19:34.200]  pound and I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere. It's
[2:19:34.200 --> 2:19:39.480]  Wake Up America Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels literally. In fact I'm not going to
[2:19:39.480 --> 2:19:46.440]  tell you a little story. We had one then. Okay you want to believe it. Anyway so it's
[2:19:46.440 --> 2:19:51.240]  infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation and if you don't fund us and don't
[2:19:51.240 --> 2:20:17.240]  want to steer that's fine. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[2:20:17.240 --> 2:20:39.520]  We have Dr. Peter Brigham, best selling author, famous medical doctor, psychiatrist, the
[2:20:39.520 --> 2:20:43.760]  guy out there for decades battling all these psychotropic drugs. He joins us now. He got
[2:20:43.760 --> 2:20:47.880]  cut off by the break talking about the fact that he's been involved with some of the top
[2:20:47.880 --> 2:20:53.800]  murder cases. Shira Killers you name it. He's a respected expert on the mind of these people.
[2:20:53.800 --> 2:20:57.440]  How do we get Hitler? How do we get Stalin? How do we get Mao? How do we get Phil Castro?
[2:20:57.440 --> 2:21:02.120]  How do we get Hugo Chavez? Well this is what happens. And so we're here again and what's
[2:21:02.120 --> 2:21:06.200]  crazy is just like Hitler wrote Mein Kampf, I've taken their words in the great reset
[2:21:06.200 --> 2:21:11.240]  and shown you their plan in their own words. The book was easy to write. So Dr. Brigham
[2:21:11.240 --> 2:21:17.360]  continuing on where you left off. Well the first principle I want to establish is just
[2:21:17.360 --> 2:21:23.040]  to help people get ready for really entering this brawl that we're going to be in and are
[2:21:23.040 --> 2:21:31.160]  in with the global predators. They are not like us. Do not be dismay. They are not. They,
[2:21:31.160 --> 2:21:37.920]  for example, all of the things that Joe Biden is doing that would look to be horrible, stupid
[2:21:37.920 --> 2:21:46.560]  mistakes by a senile man are in fact pulled by the strings everything the globalists want.
[2:21:46.560 --> 2:21:50.080]  Everything that harms America. Let's talk about that. Cutting off the energy and plotting
[2:21:50.080 --> 2:21:54.040]  the borders. Evaluating the currency. Giving blood red speeches at night with troops. Declaring
[2:21:54.040 --> 2:21:58.720]  war on his enemies. That seems like horrible and authoritarian. But to an authoritarian,
[2:21:58.720 --> 2:22:04.200]  that seems like what you do. These are all massive victories. That's right. And the fact
[2:22:04.200 --> 2:22:10.360]  that the middle class is shrinking and that the lower the working class is going to have
[2:22:10.360 --> 2:22:15.880]  too much competition. The fact that the people who are flooding into the country do not really
[2:22:15.880 --> 2:22:23.080]  have a basis in understanding America's principles and traditions. All of that is planned because
[2:22:23.080 --> 2:22:31.280]  what globalism wants is a level predation ground for themself. They want all the countries
[2:22:31.280 --> 2:22:37.760]  to level out around like Honduras with some other really devastated nation so that they
[2:22:37.760 --> 2:22:47.240]  can have the pickings. You've got to accept an absolute absence of moral, political, religious
[2:22:47.240 --> 2:22:54.920]  code and feeling toward us. We're not a totally broken social agreement. A social contract
[2:22:54.920 --> 2:23:01.520]  completely broken. Yes, that will enable them to move in with their mixture of predatory
[2:23:01.520 --> 2:23:08.240]  progressivism, predatory capitalism, and ultimately globalism, which is the theme.
[2:23:08.240 --> 2:23:13.920]  And I think the biggest thing that is finally going to happen, see the globalists, like
[2:23:13.920 --> 2:23:18.440]  the ones I've mentioned, Bill Gates and so on, I call them the Western Empire. They're
[2:23:18.440 --> 2:23:25.800]  very naive. They're working with what I call the Eastern Empire, which is Xi Jinping, and
[2:23:25.800 --> 2:23:32.120]  he is just going to eat them alive. The communists have ideology. They have a history of empires.
[2:23:32.120 --> 2:23:38.960]  They've gotten identification with taken over the world, and they are the arch predators,
[2:23:38.960 --> 2:23:45.000]  communists of predators, and they will take over the entire world if we don't stop this
[2:23:45.000 --> 2:23:52.320]  whole process. Now, other things from just the psychological viewpoint that I think is
[2:23:52.320 --> 2:23:58.120]  very important for people to understand, especially if you've not been fully educated
[2:23:58.120 --> 2:24:05.520]  yet and are a little new to this show, there are conspiracies. The idea of saying there
[2:24:05.520 --> 2:24:12.840]  are no conspiracies. I mean, we have Desmond Malone and Robert Malone now saying there
[2:24:12.840 --> 2:24:18.920]  are no conspiracies. There's no evil bad guys out there to destroy us. That's a figment
[2:24:18.920 --> 2:24:27.440]  of mass formation distortions of your mind. But think about this, folks. The law recognizes
[2:24:27.440 --> 2:24:34.760]  conspirators on every level. There's a general legal conspirator concept of, and it doesn't
[2:24:34.760 --> 2:24:40.040]  involve secrecy, by the way. It's just simply people collaborating to a lot of it.
[2:24:40.040 --> 2:24:44.040]  I'm only going to interrupt here to say this, because I like Malone, I like Desmond, and
[2:24:44.040 --> 2:24:48.440]  I get the only goes so far, you go further. But I have a stack of articles mainstream
[2:24:48.440 --> 2:24:52.480]  news saying they're using psychological warfare for fear to control us. I'll be showing those
[2:24:52.480 --> 2:24:55.680]  while you speak. So I didn't really follow what they're saying. They're saying this is
[2:24:55.680 --> 2:24:59.840]  all by accident, because I have older and the globalists are admitting they did this
[2:24:59.840 --> 2:25:09.840]  by design. Yes. Desmond actually in defense of himself after I criticized him wrote a Dutch
[2:25:09.840 --> 2:25:17.360]  article in response to us. And what he basically said, what he did say almost verbatim is do
[2:25:17.360 --> 2:25:25.520]  not try to remove the elite. It will be self defeating. That is their basic message. Other
[2:25:25.520 --> 2:25:30.800]  times they deny the existence of an elite. They go back and forth in different ways.
[2:25:30.800 --> 2:25:38.440]  But everything ultimately comes down to you cannot hold responsible, prosecute or harm
[2:25:38.440 --> 2:25:43.400]  the people who are running the world, they don't exist, or it'll be counterproductive
[2:25:43.400 --> 2:25:50.560]  and hurt you if you do. And I really cover that deeply in a whole series of articles,
[2:25:50.560 --> 2:25:59.000]  lots of references to them. In Ginger, my wife has set up a direct force to get there.
[2:25:59.000 --> 2:26:07.680]  And it's one, two, three mass psychosis. So one, two, three mass psychosis.com. You'll
[2:26:07.680 --> 2:26:13.760]  get all this stuff. But let me go on. So they're against conspiracy theories. But we have
[2:26:13.760 --> 2:26:20.040]  laws against criminal conspiracies. We have laws against antitrust conspiracies. We even
[2:26:20.040 --> 2:26:27.760]  have laws against racial discrimination conspiracies. Conspiracies are widely recognized. And every
[2:26:27.760 --> 2:26:36.040]  historian of any merit recognizes that empires are built on conspiracy. And people who run
[2:26:36.040 --> 2:26:43.480]  empires often kill their own family members along the way. They will kill the opposition.
[2:26:43.480 --> 2:26:49.080]  They'll join up, you know, Russia and Hitler joined up in a pact, a conspiracy. Then Hitler
[2:26:49.080 --> 2:26:56.120]  broke the pact. And I mean, conspiracy is runs the larger and the world. And to some
[2:26:56.120 --> 2:27:02.800]  extent, even the family world, we don't admit that we're blind to history and defenseless.
[2:27:02.800 --> 2:27:09.040]  That's exactly right. I'm trying to explain how not to be blind to history and defenseless.
[2:27:09.040 --> 2:27:15.000]  So the third arm of this thing, and this is new for me to give this detail. So this is
[2:27:15.000 --> 2:27:20.200]  a new organization of thinking I'm trying to make clear to people. Another thing is when
[2:27:20.200 --> 2:27:26.080]  we're not supposed to believe there are empires vying to run the world. The first empires
[2:27:26.080 --> 2:27:35.680]  appeared three, four, 500 years BC. They developed within a few thousand years of civilization
[2:27:35.680 --> 2:27:44.880]  as soon as we started living in large groups, towns, big towns, cities, bullies came along
[2:27:44.880 --> 2:27:52.680]  sometimes in the city, sometimes as marauders and took over. We have had massive empires
[2:27:52.680 --> 2:28:02.760]  in India and China going back about 3000 years. Some of them are lost in prehistory. So do
[2:28:02.760 --> 2:28:11.720]  not be dismayed. In World War II, we had three different empires vying for power against
[2:28:11.720 --> 2:28:18.680]  the democracies. One of them, we were sort of working with the USSR that Roosevelt was
[2:28:18.680 --> 2:28:25.880]  collaborating with the USSR and collaborating secretly at times with them. We had the Japanese
[2:28:25.880 --> 2:28:31.840]  empire and we had the Nazi empire. Empires have been ruling the world. Stay there. We'll
[2:28:31.840 --> 2:28:36.120]  come back. I'm going to shut up next segment, but we're looking at a biomedical global corporate
[2:28:36.120 --> 2:28:40.480]  technocracy empire that admits in their own words they're taking over. Dr. Peter Briggins,
[2:28:40.480 --> 2:28:44.560]  our guest, will talk about that and we'll go back and critique more the idea that mass
[2:28:44.560 --> 2:28:49.200]  formation is just magically happening by itself. They admit, I just showed during the break
[2:28:49.200 --> 2:28:53.280]  for TV viewers, saw it, radio listeners didn't see it, a whole stack of mainstream news admitting
[2:28:53.280 --> 2:28:55.880]  it's a deliberate psychological operation.
[2:28:55.880 --> 2:29:01.960]  People ask me all the time, what is your best new tropic? You've got turbo force, you've
[2:29:01.960 --> 2:29:07.760]  got brain force plus, and you've got brain force ultra. Which one is better? And that's
[2:29:07.760 --> 2:29:17.080]  like asking, what's better, a Ford F-150, or a Cadillac, or a Ferrari. It's different
[2:29:17.080 --> 2:29:22.400]  strokes for different folks. It varies, all three are different formulas, all three do
[2:29:22.400 --> 2:29:28.400]  different things. Turbo force is 10 hours of clean, out of control energy. I can't even
[2:29:28.400 --> 2:29:34.880]  take a whole pack myself. Brain force plus is a long term acting clean new tropic. This
[2:29:34.880 --> 2:29:41.840]  brain force ultra is a super fast acting new tropic that creates incredible clarity but
[2:29:41.840 --> 2:29:46.840]  doesn't last very long. They're all three different formulas. And finally, back at stock,
[2:29:46.840 --> 2:29:52.920]  massively discounted, brain force ultra is available at infowarstore.com. Brain force
[2:29:52.920 --> 2:29:56.840]  ultra, back at stock, infowarstore.com.
[2:29:56.840 --> 2:30:00.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, if millions of people get this book, our funding problems will be
[2:30:00.240 --> 2:30:04.280]  over and it's starting to happen. That's why I said, yeah, go to infowarstore.com, get
[2:30:04.280 --> 2:30:07.360]  the book, it starts shipping in a couple weeks, the great reset in the war for the world.
[2:30:07.360 --> 2:30:11.840]  But I said, go to Amazon, because it's the number one book chart in the world. And if
[2:30:11.840 --> 2:30:15.960]  it goes to number one, not a political, not of history, not of US history, it's already
[2:30:15.960 --> 2:30:20.560]  number one over 40 categories, like political science, you name it. 40 plus categories
[2:30:20.560 --> 2:30:27.360]  is number one. Ladies and gentlemen, drum roll please, of books in the world, the great
[2:30:27.360 --> 2:30:34.240]  reset in the war for the world is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[2:30:34.240 --> 2:30:40.720]  We are now number nine in the world. This is major. This is political. This could fund
[2:30:40.720 --> 2:30:46.760]  our war chest. Just go to Amazon.com, everybody, and buy 10 copies. Send this blueprint to
[2:30:46.760 --> 2:30:50.440]  the Death Star and the New World Order. Because you read this, you know their whole plan,
[2:30:50.440 --> 2:30:53.440]  how to stop them. Get the great reset in the war for the world now. It's going to go to
[2:30:53.440 --> 2:30:57.960]  number one. What do you make of that?
[2:30:57.960 --> 2:31:03.080]  Everybody knows that high quality fish oil does fantastic things for your cardiovascular

[2:33:18.320 --> 2:33:25.320]  Dr. Peter Bragg at MD, well-known famous psychiatrist, bestselling author, is here laying out what
[2:33:25.320 --> 2:33:29.520]  we're currently dealing with. And the idea that mass formation and the scaremongering
[2:33:29.520 --> 2:33:34.320]  wasn't on purpose is asinine. I wanted to get more back into that and currently where
[2:33:34.320 --> 2:33:38.160]  he sees this going. But I do see the talking point out there that the establishment made
[2:33:38.160 --> 2:33:41.920]  a mistake. They rolled this out. We have the head of the CDC. We have all the different
[2:33:41.920 --> 2:33:46.160]  federal headings. It was an accident. Yeah, it doesn't work. But hey, take your boosters.
[2:33:46.160 --> 2:33:50.840]  But you've been really zeroing in on empires. So finishing up that point.
[2:33:50.840 --> 2:33:58.680]  Yes. So it's very important. We got just like three basic points so far. The global predators
[2:33:58.680 --> 2:34:04.960]  are not like us. You must accept you're dealing with pure evil, like a Hitler, a Stalin, a
[2:34:04.960 --> 2:34:14.760]  Mao, a Xi Jinping. You're dealing with people whose only criteria for good and evil is whether
[2:34:14.760 --> 2:34:20.600]  they won or not. You've got to get that. Whether they got richer, more powerful, more
[2:34:20.600 --> 2:34:27.960]  control over you. Secondly, conspiracies are the way of the world. They're the way the
[2:34:27.960 --> 2:34:37.200]  world works. All empires are built on conspiracies. There are multiple kinds of conspiracies
[2:34:37.200 --> 2:34:44.840]  in the law going all the way up to these vast antitrust laws which have involved the effects
[2:34:44.840 --> 2:34:50.760]  of predators on millions and millions of consumers and other business people. So it's built
[2:34:50.760 --> 2:35:00.040]  into the law. And the Nuremberg Code, the four or five principle attacks on the Nazis,
[2:35:00.040 --> 2:35:08.080]  criticism within the Nazis, the final one is that it's tied together by a conspiracy.
[2:35:08.080 --> 2:35:16.720]  So it's ridiculous. Get over it, folks. Conspiracies aren't weird and crazy. They are the stuff
[2:35:16.720 --> 2:35:21.280]  of the world and probably right now one or another family member may be conspiring against
[2:35:21.280 --> 2:35:26.000]  you about how to run the next party or where you're going for vacation. It's the way the
[2:35:26.000 --> 2:35:32.040]  human mind works when it's dealing in groups. So that's very, very important.
[2:35:32.040 --> 2:35:38.640]  So now we get to the empires and I was surprised at the degree to which empires have always
[2:35:38.640 --> 2:35:43.360]  been with us. There's hardly a time when we haven't had empires. If we didn't have people
[2:35:43.360 --> 2:35:48.800]  trying to take over empires, run empires, build new empires right now, it would be the
[2:35:48.800 --> 2:35:56.040]  first time in more than 2,000 or 3,000 years that that wasn't so. Now Desmond Malone say
[2:35:56.040 --> 2:36:01.520]  there's a big difference now. Now for the first time we have totalitarianism. It just
[2:36:01.520 --> 2:36:07.200]  began with the likes of Hitler and Mussolini and so on and so forth. Well, first of all,
[2:36:07.200 --> 2:36:14.280]  that's not the opinion of historians in general. If you look at just simply totalitarianism
[2:36:14.280 --> 2:36:22.680]  discussed online in the Encyclopedia Britannica, which is pretty sound for summaries way ahead
[2:36:22.680 --> 2:36:29.040]  of the usual stuff, they point out that totalitarianism goes all the way back to the earliest Chinese
[2:36:29.040 --> 2:36:35.000]  and Indian empires which attempted to control every bit of life they could, including killing
[2:36:35.000 --> 2:36:45.600]  freedom of speech. So it goes way back. Desmond Malone observed that there's been a real change
[2:36:45.600 --> 2:36:54.400]  since Hitler and those folks, modern totalitarianism, I'd call it, in that the people are more cooperative
[2:36:54.400 --> 2:36:59.680]  and the people actually get really weirded out and they even attack other people and
[2:36:59.680 --> 2:37:05.840]  they become arms of totalitarianism. And in fact, that's true, but it's the exact opposite
[2:37:05.840 --> 2:37:13.840]  reason from Malone and Desmond who want to protect the elites. What has changed is the
[2:37:13.840 --> 2:37:17.440]  power of the elites to terrify murder.
[2:37:17.440 --> 2:37:22.080]  Well, that's right. You couldn't, 500 years ago, or 100 years ago, everybody in one room,
[2:37:22.080 --> 2:37:28.960]  but with mass media, you can mass program. And mass terrify. If you look back, for example,
[2:37:28.960 --> 2:37:34.560]  he tries to say, both of them in their writings, try to say that Hitler was a different kind
[2:37:34.560 --> 2:37:40.080]  of totalitarian. He's practically, they claim, hypnotized himself with mass hypnosis. This
[2:37:40.080 --> 2:37:46.040]  whole group is mass hypnosis to which Malone added the word psychosis, which we should
[2:37:46.040 --> 2:37:51.440]  discuss when we get a minute later. But at any rate, they're wrong. It is not that the
[2:37:51.440 --> 2:37:58.000]  current dictators have less influence and the people have more. Hitler killed over 20
[2:37:58.000 --> 2:38:04.720]  million people, gaining power over the world and intimidating people. The Nazis committed
[2:38:04.720 --> 2:38:06.600]  atrocities on the streets.
[2:38:06.600 --> 2:38:10.480]  And if you read Goebbels' writings that are public, they were fully aware of what they
[2:38:10.480 --> 2:38:11.480]  were doing.
[2:38:11.480 --> 2:38:18.320]  Absolutely. Propagandizing, as you pointed out, like never before. In Russia, Stalin killed
[2:38:18.320 --> 2:38:24.760]  people because he could, just to show it. Maybe 40 million people. And the most murderous
[2:38:24.760 --> 2:38:31.440]  of all the regimes is still in existence. There is data that the Chinese Communist Party's
[2:38:31.440 --> 2:38:39.640]  own estimate of how many civilian Chinese would be 80 plus million. Yes. I one is up
[2:38:39.640 --> 2:38:49.240]  to 100. That's right. So we're looking at a situation in which vast intimidation and
[2:38:49.240 --> 2:38:56.400]  threat is what is terrorizing people and making them look like they're out of it to perhaps
[2:38:56.400 --> 2:38:57.920]  other people.
[2:38:57.920 --> 2:39:03.880]  So they've industrialized fear. The authoritarians have gotten really good at mass fear.
[2:39:03.880 --> 2:39:10.800]  Mass fear. Absolutely. Mass fear. And if you look at how the people are behaving, the doctors
[2:39:10.800 --> 2:39:19.280]  and a lot of people that they call having mass psychosis, they are identical to the
[2:39:19.280 --> 2:39:24.400]  people I saw in the state mental hospitals when I led a volunteer program at Harvard
[2:39:24.400 --> 2:39:30.560]  back in the 50s. They're identical to the people I saw when I went behind the Iron Curtain
[2:39:30.560 --> 2:39:35.960]  shortly before the war came down. They're identical to the patients in my practice who
[2:39:35.960 --> 2:39:42.720]  come from severely abusive backgrounds and child abused people. They're afraid to think
[2:39:42.720 --> 2:39:48.800]  for themselves. They're afraid to threaten anybody. They're afraid to stand up for themselves.
[2:39:48.800 --> 2:39:55.800]  Desmet and blown. You are criminally betraying, in my opinion, the people you are saying have
[2:39:55.800 --> 2:40:03.880]  spontaneous psychosis when they are like every other victim of a cult or an abuse or a murderous
[2:40:03.880 --> 2:40:10.880]  situation since time began. It's what people do when they are overwhelmed, terrified.
[2:40:10.880 --> 2:40:15.800]  Sure. I mean, I like Desmet. I like Malone and I'm not a psychiatrist like you and Renown,
[2:40:15.800 --> 2:40:21.360]  but it's an important distinction, though. How are they claiming this just naturally
[2:40:21.360 --> 2:40:26.000]  happened? I mean, I watched some of what they do. I kind of missed that amount of psychiatrists,
[2:40:26.000 --> 2:40:27.000]  but what's the distinction?
[2:40:27.000 --> 2:40:34.920]  It's always missing because what they say no one has ever written about before Hannah
[2:40:34.920 --> 2:40:41.360]  Ant, who is a really weird person. Hannah Ant talked a little bit about this when she
[2:40:41.360 --> 2:40:48.840]  as a Jew claimed the Jews were responsible for anti-Semitism. Anne Hannah Ant is one
[2:40:48.840 --> 2:40:55.720]  of his heroes. Desmet quotes her about Hitler wasn't a violent, brutal person. He was caught
[2:40:55.720 --> 2:41:01.800]  up in mass hypnosis. Oh, my God, this is in the book if you read it in Desmet's book.
[2:41:01.800 --> 2:41:07.560]  So what they're trying to do is to somehow, you have to understand the agenda because
[2:41:07.560 --> 2:41:12.920]  it doesn't make psychological sense. The agenda is what Desmet wrote in response to
[2:41:12.920 --> 2:41:20.440]  me. Don't you dare try to remove any of the elites. It'll be self-defeating. So they're
[2:41:20.440 --> 2:41:26.760]  saying that the people are ultimately to blame for this. Now they'll talk in one place
[2:41:26.760 --> 2:41:32.040]  about, well, the media affected them, but then Desmet in another place in his book will
[2:41:32.040 --> 2:41:38.360]  say, but the media was not a conspiracy. The media wasn't organized. They would just
[2:41:38.360 --> 2:41:39.360]  part of it.
[2:41:39.360 --> 2:41:42.680]  Would you debate Desmet on the show?
[2:41:42.680 --> 2:41:48.600]  We have offered him a number of opportunities to debate me in Europe and the United States.
[2:41:48.600 --> 2:41:55.720]  Just recently Malcolm on America Out Loud invited him. He has stopped responding.
[2:41:55.720 --> 2:42:00.520]  Let me say this. I'll be honest with you. I agree with your analysis of how the world
[2:42:00.520 --> 2:42:04.760]  works. I have all their admissions. They ran it on purpose and I'm not against anybody,
[2:42:04.760 --> 2:42:09.640]  but I think we should have a fair debate here on air about this because the idea when these
[2:42:09.640 --> 2:42:13.960]  major defense departments are admitting they're running mass psychosis and fear and hysteria
[2:42:13.960 --> 2:42:19.000]  and their words, brainwashing and, quote, terrifying the public. I don't think you can
[2:42:19.000 --> 2:42:23.080]  debate that. And I'll be honest with you. I'm not saying you're wrong, Dr. Reagan. I
[2:42:23.080 --> 2:42:27.160]  just want to follow their work, didn't exactly pick up what you're saying. I believe you.
[2:42:27.160 --> 2:42:31.960]  But to say that this isn't premeditated fear mongering is bullshit.
[2:42:31.960 --> 2:42:40.040]  Yes. Well, I would be happy to debate them separately or if I must together. Malone has
[2:42:40.040 --> 2:42:47.240]  gotten very angry at Malcolm at America Out Loud for asking him to have a debate with me
[2:42:47.240 --> 2:42:53.240]  this Tuesday, yesterday. Let's talk about when come back because I mean,
[2:42:53.240 --> 2:42:55.560]  I don't need to be a psychiatrist. You know, this is on purpose. I mean,
[2:42:57.240 --> 2:43:04.920]  the rage for more than a decade have been concentrated green powders with wheatgrass

[2:43:15.720 --> 2:43:21.720]  top sourced top the line as good as going to get, but then the supply chain broke down and it was
[2:43:21.720 --> 2:43:27.800]  sold out for more than a year. Finally, green fiber capsules, this big old bottle jam packed

[2:44:04.920 --> 2:44:10.920]  Challenge. First of all, let me say I love your products. I am a granny and for all the senior
[2:44:10.920 --> 2:44:16.280]  citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots
[2:44:16.280 --> 2:44:21.880]  or age spots as they're lovingly called. But since taking your x2 for the last couple of years,
[2:44:21.880 --> 2:44:29.320]  my skin is just really gorgeous. Actually, people think I'm 55 years old. And I was already taking
[2:44:29.320 --> 2:44:33.800]  your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do because I
[2:44:33.800 --> 2:44:38.120]  just thought it was a hopeless situation. But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen
[2:44:38.120 --> 2:44:44.120]  immediately. But, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a
[2:44:44.120 --> 2:44:49.800]  ticket. This is working. This is wonderful. You know, I don't, I don't have to put on derma blend
[2:44:49.800 --> 2:44:55.480]  anymore, you know, so anyway, it works wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[2:44:57.160 --> 2:45:02.680]  Donald Trump and the Magna Republicans represented extremism that threatens the very
[2:45:02.680 --> 2:45:07.720]  foundations of our republic. I wouldn't be surprised if this doesn't have an operational name.
[2:45:08.680 --> 2:45:15.320]  In fact, I bet it does. I bet it's called Operation Matador. They see us as the bull,
[2:45:15.320 --> 2:45:21.640]  and they are shaky, a red flag in our face. And the Matador is the deep state with a long,
[2:45:22.200 --> 2:45:28.520]  skinny razor shark sword, so that when the bull lunges forward, the Matador uses the force of its
[2:45:28.520 --> 2:45:34.520]  weight to drive it into the heart and step aside with his cape as the bull varies himself into
[2:45:34.520 --> 2:45:39.800]  the dust. They've got the ace of spades in their hand, which is false flags. Before you launch a
[2:45:39.800 --> 2:45:44.200]  war, you stage false flags. That's the first thing you do. Because nobody wants to say they
[2:45:44.200 --> 2:45:50.280]  started a war. Bad guys start wars. So every time a war gets launched by bad guys, they stage an
[2:45:50.280 --> 2:45:52.920]  event. This is Operation Matador.

[2:47:02.520 --> 2:47:11.400]  it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:17.960 --> 2:47:24.280]  All right, I don't want to sit here and obsess over Dr. Malone or Professor Mesmond.
[2:47:24.840 --> 2:47:29.800]  Because I think they've been a lot of good exposing this as mind control, but the claim
[2:47:29.800 --> 2:47:35.240]  that it's not deliberate when it's all admittedly deliberate, and we have Operation Lockstep and
[2:47:35.240 --> 2:47:44.600]  Event 201 and Spars 2025, 2028 is just preposterous. And I am seeing the talking point now that, oh,
[2:47:45.240 --> 2:47:49.880]  this is all by accident, by the power structure, and now the elites are saying, oh, it was an accident,
[2:47:49.880 --> 2:47:54.040]  we didn't know it wouldn't work. They're clearly trying to cover their ass. They're running through
[2:47:54.040 --> 2:48:02.680]  a psychological program. We can harp on this all day, but big picture. What do you think the next
[2:48:02.680 --> 2:48:09.000]  attack Dr. Peter Brigham is going to be? Because clearly what we just saw in my view was a beta test
[2:48:09.000 --> 2:48:11.400]  and something bigger is about to come in. Or do you think I'm wrong?
[2:48:12.760 --> 2:48:20.040]  Well, I think there's a few big things going on. One of them Malone has set up. So I'd like
[2:48:20.040 --> 2:48:26.680]  to take just a few more minutes on that. We have just watched a video with Malone and Desmond
[2:48:26.680 --> 2:48:35.080]  talking. It's on our website again, and that's 123maspsychosis.com. That's just for this.
[2:48:35.800 --> 2:48:41.960]  Malone and Desmond agree that this was Malone's idea entirely to put in psychosis.
[2:48:42.680 --> 2:48:48.520]  Once a physician and now working along with a psychologist, professor of psychology,
[2:48:48.520 --> 2:48:56.120]  once you establish the concept of calling groups of people psychotic, you've established a new
[2:48:56.120 --> 2:49:03.960]  attack that has never existed before. In Russia and now still in China, dissidents are locked up
[2:49:03.960 --> 2:49:09.160]  individually. They'd be tortured given psychiatric drugs. They can be tortured,
[2:49:10.200 --> 2:49:16.120]  locked up in general. It's a horrible experience being called psychotic as a horrible experience.
[2:49:16.120 --> 2:49:24.520]  But now Malone has set up. Interestingly, in this piece we have a clip of the video,
[2:49:24.520 --> 2:49:30.440]  you can see Desmond's a little uneasy about it. He says it well erases ethical and other issues.
[2:49:34.680 --> 2:49:42.280]  We're in a very dangerous situation for the really militarizing psychiatry,
[2:49:42.280 --> 2:49:50.040]  weaponizing concepts in psychiatry. Now that so popular and seemingly so well established with
[2:49:50.040 --> 2:49:55.880]  no research whatsoever, zero. There's no research in his book. There's no research in any of
[2:49:55.880 --> 2:50:02.280]  there. None of them written articles about this. It's really quite bizarre. But at any rate,
[2:50:02.280 --> 2:50:07.080]  I'm very concerned about the weaponization of psychiatry, which will go.
[2:50:07.080 --> 2:50:12.520]  So the establishment creates fear-mongering, scares everyone, brags about it, and Pentagon press
[2:50:12.520 --> 2:50:17.000]  releases. And then people that come out, the leaders of the resistance, and say it's the public's
[2:50:17.000 --> 2:50:21.160]  fault. Is that what you're saying? It's right. Well let's play the one minute clip you're talking
[2:50:21.160 --> 2:50:28.760]  about. Here it is. And then Robert mentioned me at the Joe Robbins. And he added the term
[2:50:28.760 --> 2:50:35.240]  to the term masternation. And that was very successful I think. It made me famous around the
[2:50:35.240 --> 2:50:43.080]  world. Or infamous, yes. The term that he added was? I doubt it a little bit. The term that he
[2:50:43.080 --> 2:50:49.880]  added was? Psychosis. Psychosis. So I always use the term mass formation, just referring actually
[2:50:49.880 --> 2:50:57.000]  simply to the formation of a mass or a crowd in a society. And then Robert added the term
[2:50:57.000 --> 2:51:01.320]  psychosis to it, which made it a little bit more sensational I think. And which made it spread
[2:51:01.320 --> 2:51:07.800]  around the world. But of course at the same time it maybe added, well, from an ethical pragmatic
[2:51:07.800 --> 2:51:14.120]  and an intellectual point of view, it makes the term have a different meaning or a different
[2:51:14.120 --> 2:51:19.000]  connotation that depends a little bit. But it was a very good move I believe to make the theory
[2:51:19.000 --> 2:51:25.400]  famous around the world. But I mean mass formation psychosis is mob psychology. I think the debate
[2:51:25.400 --> 2:51:30.360]  here is who's triggering it. Obviously it's an outside group. And I'll be honest with you,
[2:51:30.360 --> 2:51:34.040]  Bregan, I think you're a great guy known about you for decades, had you on as a guest for.
[2:51:34.040 --> 2:51:38.280]  Not saying you're wrong, but where are they specifically saying the elites aren't involved?
[2:51:38.280 --> 2:51:43.160]  Because I had Desmond here like last week or two weeks ago, and he was saying no, no, the system
[2:51:43.160 --> 2:51:48.520]  is manipulating and helping create it. He's just saying it's the people giving it the power. Or
[2:51:48.520 --> 2:51:54.200]  am I wrong? No, that's where he goes when he's pushed, when he's dealing with someone like you
[2:51:54.760 --> 2:51:59.560]  or me. But listen to that what you just said, but it's the people who are pushing it.
[2:51:59.560 --> 2:52:07.480]  And that's just not so. That's a lie. The people are terrorized. The people are frightened to death.
[2:52:07.480 --> 2:52:11.800]  The people can't think straight. You're saying this is a blaming of the victim.
[2:52:11.800 --> 2:52:16.680]  This is a blaming of the victim. This is classic victim blaming, which by the way,
[2:52:17.240 --> 2:52:24.280]  Freud carried out to an extreme, and he is a Freudian analyst, he says. I talk about that a
[2:52:24.280 --> 2:52:30.840]  little bit in the materials I've written. It is classic victim blaming. And they say many things.
[2:52:30.840 --> 2:52:36.760]  The way you have to read their writing, and I understand this is typical of kind of. Listen,
[2:52:36.760 --> 2:52:41.160]  I'm not a famous psychiatrist like you. I hear you. I agree with what you're saying that something's
[2:52:41.160 --> 2:52:45.880]  wrong. Or I'm just saying as a regular person, it's asinine to claim this isn't deliberate.
[2:52:47.240 --> 2:52:52.040]  That's right. And I think that's as simple as that. And that's the simple observation.
[2:52:52.040 --> 2:52:59.000]  But there's a big question about the real big question about weaponizing psychosis like that.
[2:52:59.000 --> 2:53:05.480]  People don't understand psychosis is an actual psychiatric diagnosis. A psychiatrist could
[2:53:05.480 --> 2:53:11.720]  take what he's heard from alone and say, yes, that's in the official diagnostic categories.
[2:53:11.720 --> 2:53:20.600]  It's a psychosis with delusions and paranoia. And just fit it right in. It would go right on
[2:53:20.600 --> 2:53:28.440]  through any political psychiatric hospital like we have had in the USSR and have still in China.
[2:53:28.440 --> 2:53:35.640]  There's a second thing they do we haven't talked about on page 126 to 128 and Desmond's book.
[2:53:35.640 --> 2:53:43.640]  He then analyzes you and me. He analyzes conspiracy theorists. He says in another part of the book,
[2:53:43.640 --> 2:53:51.880]  we're like a different mass formation on 126 to 128. He says that you and I are confused,
[2:53:52.680 --> 2:53:59.000]  extremely anxious, bewildered, frightened by what we see happening around us with the mass
[2:53:59.000 --> 2:54:05.320]  formation. We can't accept it comes out of the people themselves out of ourselves, in fact.
[2:54:06.200 --> 2:54:12.520]  And so we search to and we have these desperate needs to do something about it. Those are the
[2:54:12.520 --> 2:54:21.400]  key words are all quotes. So we go and we make up that they are so-called elites and he puts them
[2:54:21.400 --> 2:54:25.480]  in quotes. You see one point he talks about elites and other points he makes believe they don't exist.
[2:54:26.520 --> 2:54:33.880]  That the so-called elites are to blame instead of, he says, blaming oneself.
[2:54:34.840 --> 2:54:41.240]  And I at one point said at least Malone didn't go to this extreme of saying not only are the
[2:54:41.240 --> 2:54:46.920]  people to blame but that the people who are thinking in terms of the conspiracies really
[2:54:46.920 --> 2:54:55.000]  systematic, you know, planned events. And I said Malone didn't do that. Now Malone has come out and
[2:54:55.000 --> 2:54:59.800]  said basically they're the good guys who have been red-pilled. He doesn't quite say they're good.
[2:54:59.800 --> 2:55:05.880]  But then he says those of us who do the conspiracy theories, we're black. That's Malone.
[2:55:05.880 --> 2:55:13.000]  Well, I'm not going to judge any of these guys. I just know I have hundreds of press releases
[2:55:13.000 --> 2:55:18.680]  by defense departments in the West saying they ran brainwashing, mind control, fear control.
[2:55:18.680 --> 2:55:23.000]  I just showed the stacks like five times. I mean, they ran this. It's not debatable.
[2:55:23.000 --> 2:55:26.600]  So I'm not debating you. I just haven't followed their work that closely.
[2:55:26.600 --> 2:55:29.720]  You're saying they claim the publics to blame for all this fear?
[2:55:29.720 --> 2:55:35.880]  Well, basically, yes. And yes, and what you said, if you think about what you said,
[2:55:35.880 --> 2:55:41.960]  that it's basically the power in the people they're saying. The power is not in these poor people
[2:55:41.960 --> 2:55:44.840]  who are so scared as physicians that they'll lose their lives.
[2:55:44.840 --> 2:55:49.000]  Well, so they're blaming the public, terrorized that it's their fault instead of saying you were
[2:55:49.000 --> 2:55:54.840]  lied to now find your power and don't give them the fear. It's a twisted way to blame the public.
[2:55:54.840 --> 2:55:59.800]  That's right. And in fact, like page two or three where he talks in his book, Desmond,
[2:55:59.800 --> 2:56:03.400]  about what we need to do, he says, we need to make ourselves better.
[2:56:04.600 --> 2:56:10.200]  And I gather that's practically like a movement in Europe. Let's make ourselves better rather
[2:56:10.200 --> 2:56:15.160]  than let's stand up to the globalists who are really destroying Europe right now.
[2:56:15.160 --> 2:56:18.600]  Let me give you a key folks to how to read propaganda.
[2:56:19.720 --> 2:56:23.800]  First of all, there'll be a lot that makes you feel good about yourself in it.
[2:56:23.800 --> 2:56:30.120]  Oh, my God, there's been so much suffering. But what you must look for is there a theme coming
[2:56:30.120 --> 2:56:36.520]  out that undermines us, that makes war against us. In this case, that blinds us.
[2:56:36.520 --> 2:56:41.960]  So there'd be plenty in Desmond's things and in Malone's things. But look for the theme.
[2:56:43.080 --> 2:56:50.680]  You are to blame. The middle bureaucracy is just confused. They've got bad planning going on in
[2:56:50.680 --> 2:56:57.800]  their groups. They've got group think it's just a problem. Bricks. Bricks is not a violent,
[2:56:57.800 --> 2:57:04.840]  hateful human being. She was in bad. It's a help me God, she was in bad task forces run by poor
[2:57:04.840 --> 2:57:10.360]  psychodynamics. I mean, this and you have to look at that and say, well, wait, wait, wait a minute,
[2:57:10.360 --> 2:57:15.560]  those people in those groups were violent, progressive, trying to destroy Donald Trump.
[2:57:15.560 --> 2:57:19.400]  Well, the reason I know you're right, Dr. Bregan, is when you read the battle plan,
[2:57:19.400 --> 2:57:25.080]  the general funds looked at others. It's a battle plan. They say when it all comes out,
[2:57:25.080 --> 2:57:28.680]  the vaccines are poisoned, we'll just act like it's an accident. And they war game,
[2:57:28.680 --> 2:57:35.320]  got to do exactly what you're saying. It's hard. I did not want to do what we're doing.
[2:57:35.960 --> 2:57:43.240]  We we we did not want to cause conflict. But every single movement of our
[2:57:43.240 --> 2:57:51.960]  hold on, stay there. The rage for more than a decade have been concentrated green powders

[2:57:58.840 --> 2:58:04.200]  vibrant and to defend our immune systems. Now over a year and a half ago, we came out with
[2:58:04.200 --> 2:58:09.960]  a product that was top sourced top the line as good as going to get. But then the supply chain
[2:58:09.960 --> 2:58:15.160]  broke down and it was sold out for more than a year. Finally, green fiber capsules, this big

[2:59:04.040 --> 2:59:10.440]  in the world. It will never be made again. It's not just an amazing historic coin. It funds
[2:59:10.440 --> 2:59:15.640]  the information war against the globalist. This is something you want to hand down to your grandchildren.
[2:59:15.640 --> 2:59:21.720]  This is something you want to own. And as a fundraiser, it is funding the information war
[2:59:21.720 --> 2:59:26.280]  against the globalist. Ladies and gentlemen, 10,000 coins are available. They'll sell out very

[2:59:46.200 --> 3:00:03.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[3:00:04.040 --> 3:00:13.240]  The system is normalizing, putting mission-ogenic weapons into our bodies. And a lot of people
[3:00:13.240 --> 3:00:18.600]  don't want to admit it's by design, but it is. Peter Brigham, your book is the best seller
[3:00:18.600 --> 3:00:23.880]  dealing with this. The medical rebel.com that we married is coming up. You are
[3:00:23.880 --> 3:00:28.920]  brigham.com and we are thepray.com for your book. In five minutes closing, finish up the
[3:00:28.920 --> 3:00:34.520]  points you want to make. Well, God, I'm glad you put the book where my wife would be very mad at
[3:00:34.520 --> 3:00:40.760]  me. It's COVID-19 and the global predators. She had it directly from us at wearethepray.com. If
[3:00:40.760 --> 3:00:49.560]  you want to bypass, you can get the e-book and the reading book. The three forms are all up on
[3:00:49.560 --> 3:00:57.400]  Amazon. A point that I think is so important to make is that every institution in western
[3:00:57.400 --> 3:01:04.440]  civilization has been infiltrated and corrupted by the globalists and by the predators. There is
[3:01:04.440 --> 3:01:09.480]  no institution that that hasn't happened to. I've never mentioned it before on the radio,
[3:01:09.480 --> 3:01:18.040]  but I had my own institution for many years that was infiltrated by very sweet, nice progressives
[3:01:18.040 --> 3:01:23.800]  who took it over and we eventually had to renounce it and get legal action to get them
[3:01:24.440 --> 3:01:33.080]  no longer use my name. So it's a very common experience. So if once I realized that these
[3:01:33.080 --> 3:01:39.080]  people were clearly progressives, clearly, in the case of Malone, the deepest state person
[3:01:39.080 --> 3:01:44.600]  whose life I've ever looked at and he's still very deep state, I don't think we have time to go
[3:01:44.600 --> 3:01:50.920]  into that now, but he has in various documents where he's an expert in legal cases. I have no
[3:01:50.920 --> 3:01:58.040]  quarrel with that. He has given his resume and he is right now at the heart of NIH and it's an
[3:01:58.040 --> 3:02:05.800]  attempt to bring the great reset into NIH and something called NIH active, ACTIV. Easy to find
[3:02:05.800 --> 3:02:15.400]  NIH active and Malone is a big part of that and it is the great reset in NIH, including
[3:02:15.400 --> 3:02:20.200]  Bill Gates, including the big drug companies, including the Defense Department and the health
[3:02:20.200 --> 3:02:27.400]  things. Now, given that the biggest threat to us around the whole world is the infiltration of
[3:02:27.400 --> 3:02:35.640]  our civilization, of even the right, even the Republican Party crushed by this kind of infiltration,
[3:02:35.640 --> 3:02:42.840]  Donald Trump crushed partially, I think he's common back out, from infiltration that he could not
[3:02:42.840 --> 3:02:49.320]  believe. He could not believe how evil the people around him were. When I realized what the effect
[3:02:50.360 --> 3:02:57.080]  of the writings, speaking, and activities of Desmond and Malone were, suck in nearly the air
[3:02:57.080 --> 3:03:03.000]  out of the room. I don't travel, but the people traveling with him become secondary and they
[3:03:03.000 --> 3:03:10.360]  are the great scientists. He is the shining face that this man could not possibly and represent our
[3:03:11.160 --> 3:03:18.200]  health freedom movement or the greater freedom movement and I felt I had to risk my reputation,
[3:03:18.200 --> 3:03:24.920]  all the love I give and share on my own TV shows and the radio show with Ginger. We have such
[3:03:24.920 --> 3:03:32.680]  wonderful loving relationships throughout the movement that I had to risk that because I was
[3:03:32.680 --> 3:03:42.760]  seeing two people who were actually becoming like theoreticians of the movement and in Malone's case,
[3:03:42.760 --> 3:03:50.040]  introducing psychosis, weaponizing psychosis against masses, introducing communist concepts of
[3:03:50.040 --> 3:03:57.080]  masses. That's not a freedom concept. Ginger just told me she's appalled. Freedom groups are all
[3:03:57.080 --> 3:04:03.560]  talking about masses now. That's not right. It's individuals for God's sakes and so I just felt I
[3:04:03.560 --> 3:04:10.600]  had to take this on and it was not pleasant, but by gosh, we ended up getting more love than we've
[3:04:10.600 --> 3:04:17.080]  ever had before in our lives from the groups around us and I just want to thank everybody
[3:04:17.080 --> 3:04:23.480]  for that very, very much. Well, bottom line, and again, I'll be honest, I haven't tracked
[3:04:23.480 --> 3:04:27.880]  everything. They're saying that close. I've heard people that it's true. The idea this happened by
[3:04:27.880 --> 3:04:32.120]  accident is preposterous, so hopefully they'll respond more to that. Hopefully they'll have a
[3:04:32.120 --> 3:04:35.560]  debate here on the air. Dr. Peter Bracken, thank you so much for the time today. I really appreciate
[3:04:35.560 --> 3:04:41.640]  you. Oh God, I'm so glad to be here. Thank you. Amazing. Thank you so much. All right, folks,
[3:04:41.640 --> 3:04:49.320]  we've got the next guest hope just coming up and then Owen Shroyer, 3pm Central, Dr. Lee Merritt
[3:04:49.320 --> 3:04:54.200]  on fire, straight ahead, infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[3:04:57.160 --> 3:05:02.200]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or pump gas or whether you're a farmer, a rancher, a doctor,
[3:05:02.200 --> 3:05:07.160]  a lawyer, or a millionaire. Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles. You see
[3:05:07.160 --> 3:05:11.720]  it every year, 30 different tax returns, 30 different answers, 50 different tax returns,
[3:05:11.720 --> 3:05:17.640]  50 different answers, and almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the
[3:05:17.640 --> 3:05:21.800]  big tax groups, because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public
[3:05:21.800 --> 3:05:26.840]  understanding this and knowing this. So it's a very important situation with inflation and all
[3:05:26.840 --> 3:05:33.240]  the things out there hurting everybody. To be able to do things tax wise, it's legal and lawful
[3:05:33.240 --> 3:05:36.760]  that allows you to keep more your money. We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great
[3:05:36.760 --> 3:05:45.080]  tax advice in the last few years. The only way you fail is not writing down the URL jonestaxrelief.com,

[3:05:53.560 --> 3:06:07.400]  All right, thank you. Welcome back to the Fourth Hour of the Alex Jones Show. I'm Dr. Lee Merritt,
[3:06:07.400 --> 3:06:14.040]  your drug and host for the hour. Usually, you can find me at themedicalrebel.com and we deconstruct
[3:06:14.040 --> 3:06:21.320]  the lives of the medical matrix. That's why my background today. Now, it's a little tough when
[3:06:21.320 --> 3:06:26.840]  you're out weeding your garden in the middle of nowhere and you get a call to a guest host,
[3:06:26.840 --> 3:06:31.080]  probably the most famous show in the world, and figure out what you're going to do for a
[3:06:31.080 --> 3:06:36.040]  soliloquy for an hour. So you call your friends and then I, of course, I had to ask my husband
[3:06:36.040 --> 3:06:40.920]  and he wanted me to talk about the border, which I'm not a security expert, but I decided that
[3:06:41.880 --> 3:06:45.400]  you have to listen to your husband or you're not going to be happy. So anyway,
[3:06:45.400 --> 3:06:49.480]  I decided to combine those two. So I'm going to start by talking a little bit about what I've
[3:06:49.480 --> 3:06:53.640]  learned when I lived on the border because border is a big deal right now. Let's talk,
[3:06:53.640 --> 3:07:01.400]  I'm going to talk about the medical aspects of the border. So in the 1990s, I started my
[3:07:01.400 --> 3:07:06.680]  orthopedic practice, a stone's throw from the southern border in Arizona. And at the time I
[3:07:06.680 --> 3:07:11.320]  started, most of the trauma that we did were elderly women with hip fractures. I mean, it wasn't,
[3:07:11.320 --> 3:07:18.600]  it wasn't, you know, the snowbirds, people like me that age out and we migrate down from Iowa to
[3:07:18.600 --> 3:07:25.480]  Arizona to get warm in the winter. So anyway, but by about 2000, we were, we were spending every
[3:07:25.480 --> 3:07:30.280]  night taking care of illegals, jumping the fence. And these were these bad ankle fractures. I used
[3:07:30.280 --> 3:07:35.240]  to joke with the border patrol agents that, you know, you either have to make the fence taller
[3:07:35.240 --> 3:07:39.320]  or you have to get rid of it because you've got to do exactly the right level where these guys,
[3:07:39.320 --> 3:07:42.200]  they have this thing where they used to climb. I don't know if this is still going on, but they
[3:07:42.200 --> 3:07:46.600]  would climb over each other's on stand on each other's shoulders, holding their somebody would
[3:07:46.600 --> 3:07:51.880]  hold their ankles. And if the whole column started to fall, somebody would have in that column would
[3:07:51.880 --> 3:07:57.480]  be the pivot point, it would have a horrible open, you know, what we call a grade three ankle
[3:07:57.480 --> 3:08:03.880]  fracture or pylon fracture. And then we're in a desert so that they'd fall four, six feet off into
[3:08:03.880 --> 3:08:09.240]  sand that would complicate the injury. And this was happening every night. And trust me, you know,
[3:08:09.240 --> 3:08:15.000]  the hospital's got some funding for taking care of undocumented people, but we did not. So every
[3:08:15.000 --> 3:08:19.240]  night you were, you know, on call, you were, which was a couple nights a week, you're taking care
[3:08:19.240 --> 3:08:23.480]  of these guys and it takes a long time to do these cases. And you're not getting paid. And it's
[3:08:23.480 --> 3:08:26.840]  tough because then you have to get up in the morning and take care of your regular patients.
[3:08:28.040 --> 3:08:33.880]  It was easier when I was younger. But, you know, it really gave you gave you an insight into what
[3:08:33.880 --> 3:08:40.200]  was going on. And I can tell you this, first of all, that one night, I just realized, hey,
[3:08:40.200 --> 3:08:45.640]  hey, all that's dried up. It just dried up almost over a night. And what had happened,
[3:08:45.640 --> 3:08:50.200]  they didn't suddenly build a fence. There was nobody, what they did, it was, it was the,
[3:08:50.200 --> 3:08:55.960]  the government, our Uber lords for some reason at that point, decided not to completely overrun
[3:08:55.960 --> 3:09:00.120]  the border. So they just turned it off and they did it by allowing them to do, they got
[3:09:00.840 --> 3:09:05.640]  digital sensors on the border. And they simply told the border patrol to do their job. They
[3:09:05.640 --> 3:09:09.320]  simply let them do their job as far as I can determine, because they certainly didn't suddenly
[3:09:09.320 --> 3:09:14.040]  build a wall while I was there. Not saying a wall is a bad idea, but I am saying that you
[3:09:14.040 --> 3:09:19.000]  don't need that in order to do it. You need will. This only became, you know, it was a matter of will.
[3:09:19.000 --> 3:09:26.040]  And it happened after GW Bush went down and surveyed the border and they talked to him.
[3:09:26.040 --> 3:09:31.640]  And literally almost overnight, it dried up for a long time. But before that happened,
[3:09:31.640 --> 3:09:35.960]  I, and we still got some, and I just have to tell you this case, because it also tells you
[3:09:35.960 --> 3:09:42.200]  something about the medical issues of the border and why things are complicated and
[3:09:42.200 --> 3:09:46.520]  they don't have to be. This is, this is self inflicted by our government.
[3:09:47.400 --> 3:09:53.720]  So, you know, my sleeping is still disrupted from two to four in the morning, lots of times,
[3:09:53.720 --> 3:09:57.560]  because you're so used as an orthopedic trauma surgeon, you're so used to getting up
[3:09:57.560 --> 3:10:01.240]  when the bars start closing down or when problems happen at two in the morning.
[3:10:01.240 --> 3:10:07.000]  So this was a typical two in the morning call. And I get called in to take care of a gunshot wound
[3:10:07.000 --> 3:10:12.840]  to the foot. All right, I walk in the hospital and here's this young man who looks like a
[3:10:12.840 --> 3:10:18.200]  Donis. I mean, this is a handsome guy, muscular, perfect specimen, except for some bloodshot eyes.
[3:10:18.200 --> 3:10:23.880]  But being, you know, having good clinical acumen, I noted right away that he was chained to the bed
[3:10:23.880 --> 3:10:30.200]  and the gurney and that there was a federal marshal sitting at his side. So he, and the story
[3:10:30.200 --> 3:10:34.920]  went that he had had, he was, he was using his green card to run drugs across the border.
[3:10:35.560 --> 3:10:40.920]  And apparently he'd lost some product, I guess, in the Mexican drug guys decided to
[3:10:41.880 --> 3:10:45.480]  teach him some lessons and they shot a big hole in his foot with a shotgun.
[3:10:46.280 --> 3:10:53.080]  Well, he went to the closest hospital in Mexico and they were going to amputate his foot. And he
[3:10:53.080 --> 3:10:57.880]  realized, you know, a lot of our people don't, but he understood that free medicine is not
[3:10:57.880 --> 3:11:04.600]  necessarily the best medicine. So he literally hot footed it to the border crossing. And then we were,
[3:11:04.600 --> 3:11:11.320]  by law, required to bring him to our hospital across the border. That is really the, he got
[3:11:11.320 --> 3:11:15.240]  himself, because he had a green card. So he was able to get across the border and then we had to
[3:11:15.240 --> 3:11:22.040]  get an ambulance. So he comes, he comes to our place. And in the course of getting him ready
[3:11:22.040 --> 3:11:25.480]  for the operating room, and you know, I'm going to take care of him no matter what, I was just
[3:11:25.480 --> 3:11:30.680]  making a joke. I just looked at my emergency room friend that the doctor that, you know, was taking
[3:11:30.680 --> 3:11:35.800]  care of him called me. And I said, let me guess, this guy's insured, right? And he said, actually,
[3:11:35.800 --> 3:11:43.800]  he has Medicare. I said, what? How can this 25 year old young, healthy man have Medicare?
[3:11:44.600 --> 3:11:51.400]  And the story goes that he was involved in a gangland shooting one time, a number of years
[3:11:51.400 --> 3:11:58.840]  before, and had some kind of head grazed wound and had a quote seizure disorder and this was on
[3:11:58.840 --> 3:12:04.120]  through our government, total social security disability. Now, I haven't taken care of him.
[3:12:04.120 --> 3:12:09.560]  I tell you, there was no evidence of a seizure disorder, but I was that the most shocking thing
[3:12:09.560 --> 3:12:15.960]  is to come. The most shocking thing is the fact that the federal, I talked to the federal
[3:12:15.960 --> 3:12:20.600]  Marshall that's there, because one of the things that was very common down on the border when I
[3:12:20.600 --> 3:12:28.200]  was there is that to save money for their various departments, when these guys would come into the
[3:12:28.200 --> 3:12:33.240]  hospital, a lot of people would be unarrested. They might be brought in by border patrol,
[3:12:33.240 --> 3:12:37.560]  they might be brought in by police, but then they were kind of de arrested so that they weren't liable
[3:12:37.560 --> 3:12:42.680]  for the hospital bill and then re arrested on the other end sometimes. Well, in this case,
[3:12:42.680 --> 3:12:47.080]  and I never had anybody in literally in over 20 years is the only time this happened where
[3:12:47.080 --> 3:12:52.760]  this federal Marshall actually put on a cover and came into the operating room with me. So I knew
[3:12:52.760 --> 3:12:58.680]  this was a bad dude. So I asked, but they told me that he'd been, they'd been searching for this guy
[3:12:59.320 --> 3:13:08.040]  for for years, for four years, because he was on four federal warrants. And I said, okay, let me,
[3:13:08.040 --> 3:13:13.160]  let me just back it, let me back this up here a little bit. Let's rewind. So you're telling me
[3:13:13.160 --> 3:13:19.720]  that here's a guy who was on four federal warrants for four years. And yet you couldn't find him.
[3:13:19.720 --> 3:13:26.920]  And the answer was, yes, we couldn't find him because it is illegal to to search for somebody
[3:13:26.920 --> 3:13:35.400]  using their social security check. That is that is exactly the situation. Now, there were other
[3:13:35.400 --> 3:13:42.440]  things. One night we were called. And this is just to give you a flavor. One night we were called.
[3:13:42.440 --> 3:13:47.560]  And this was a this was an American citizen. This was one of us that apparently had robbed a store
[3:13:47.560 --> 3:13:53.560]  that police chased him through a plate glass window. And they told the emergency room staff,
[3:13:53.560 --> 3:13:59.960]  listen, if you if you see some guy that's all cut up with, you know, like lots of glass
[3:13:59.960 --> 3:14:07.960]  shards, and let us know because he may be the guy we're looking for. So yeah, the guy comes in,
[3:14:07.960 --> 3:14:12.440]  gives a fake name, nurses figure it out, they call the police and they take care of him,
[3:14:12.440 --> 3:14:19.000]  but then he's arrested. If he had been an illegal alien, that would have been illegal. And the
[3:14:19.000 --> 3:14:24.200]  people in trouble would have been the hospital emergency room staff. Because I believe it's
[3:14:24.200 --> 3:14:31.400]  17 hospitals. There's something like 17 hospitals along the border, where it is illegal to report
[3:14:31.400 --> 3:14:39.080]  anyone for being illegal, or for any reason, because they don't want to discourage these
[3:14:40.200 --> 3:14:44.840]  unfortunate people from getting the medical care that they need. That is.
[3:14:47.320 --> 3:14:54.920]  So, you know, the American citizens get arrested, but not them. I mean, there are so many,
[3:14:54.920 --> 3:15:01.720]  there are so many examples on the border of craziness like that. And I and I on the one hand,
[3:15:01.720 --> 3:15:06.040]  you don't want people to not get the medical care they need. But come on now. On the other hand,
[3:15:06.920 --> 3:15:14.040]  we have to be a nation of laws. So we'll we'll be taking a break here just in a couple seconds.
[3:15:14.040 --> 3:15:18.600]  I'm going to come back and let me tell you my plan here. I'm going to at the end of this day,
[3:15:18.600 --> 3:15:23.480]  I'm going to talk about how we get ourselves out of this. So we're not we don't succumb to the next
[3:15:23.480 --> 3:15:29.000]  thing that the psychopaths in charge throw at us. We always tend to fight the last war. Let's start
[3:15:29.000 --> 3:15:32.840]  fighting the next war medically. And so we'll be talking about that at the end of the hour.
[3:15:32.840 --> 3:15:53.400]  See you in a little bit. Thanks.
[3:15:56.920 --> 3:16:02.040]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare
[3:16:02.040 --> 3:16:07.240]  and with poisons and chemicals added to the food, it's all come out. And they're doing that not
[3:16:07.240 --> 3:16:12.920]  because we're weak, but because we're made the image of God, the Creator, and we are powerful.
[3:16:12.920 --> 3:16:18.440]  And the social engineers fear that so much. So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying
[3:16:18.440 --> 3:16:26.600]  that nobody knows who first came up with the boy. Is it true? The propaganda would not be necessary
[3:16:26.600 --> 3:16:32.760]  if the situation was hopeless. They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil
[3:16:32.760 --> 3:16:39.800]  and all their cultural death because they know we are strong. And they know in the end they signed
[3:16:39.800 --> 3:16:44.360]  on the God of this world who is a loser. And that's why it's so important that everybody keep
[3:16:44.360 --> 3:16:47.880]  them full wars in the air now more than ever. Because even if you don't believe in God,
[3:16:48.520 --> 3:16:53.720]  what the globalists are manifesting and setting up is Satan. And we are opposing the one world
[3:16:53.720 --> 3:16:57.960]  government and the mark of the beast they just announced. People ask me all the time,
[3:16:57.960 --> 3:17:02.600]  what is your best new tropic? You've got turbo force. You've got Rain Force Plus

[3:17:09.960 --> 3:17:19.400]  Ford F-150 or the Cadillac or a Ferrari. It's different strokes for different folks. It varies.
[3:17:19.400 --> 3:17:24.920]  All three are different formulas. All three do different things. Turbo force is 10 hours of

[3:19:57.320 --> 3:20:03.320]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:03.320 --> 3:20:19.000]  All right, so this is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show. I'm Dr. Lee Merritt and thanks
[3:20:19.000 --> 3:20:24.920]  for having me today. Now the next thing I wanted to talk about before we get to solutions, I want
[3:20:24.920 --> 3:20:32.200]  to talk about the numbers that are coming in. I have to say honestly, data doesn't seem to matter.
[3:20:32.200 --> 3:20:36.120]  They're going to roll these things out. They're going to keep injecting our children and killing
[3:20:36.120 --> 3:20:41.800]  people regardless of data. So this is beyond a data dome, but I'm just going to tell you what's
[3:20:41.800 --> 3:20:48.040]  going on because everybody asks. You know, there's a Facebook group out there. It's called Died
[3:20:48.040 --> 3:20:54.760]  Suddenly I think. And they have over 250,000 entries now. I remember when that started and it
[3:20:54.760 --> 3:21:02.440]  was very, very few, but now it's over 250,000 entries. There was an Irish emergency room study
[3:21:02.440 --> 3:21:07.800]  recently although I guess this comes out of their government data. But anyway, they looked at the
[3:21:07.800 --> 3:21:13.400]  normal rates versus this rate of emergency room visits. And normally between June and July,
[3:21:13.400 --> 3:21:21.400]  I mean January and June, there are 115,000 emergency room visits in Ireland in 2022.
[3:21:21.400 --> 3:21:26.760]  Now keep in mind, this isn't the year of COVID. This is the year of the vaccine, 719,000. So the
[3:21:26.760 --> 3:21:34.280]  ER visits have gone up in Ireland seven times during 2022. Now I ask you this because why are
[3:21:34.280 --> 3:21:44.520]  doctors still completely in the dark about this? There's a person named Odessa Orlowitz
[3:21:44.520 --> 3:21:49.320]  of Liberty and she's been one of the people reporting on these Canadian doctors dying.
[3:21:49.320 --> 3:21:54.760]  You know, first we saw a picture of four doctors in the same hospital in Canada dying
[3:21:54.760 --> 3:22:01.400]  after they took the mandated booster. They're mandating the fourth booster for medical personnel
[3:22:01.400 --> 3:22:09.160]  now. Fortunately, we don't seem to be doing that most places. And please don't let it happen in
[3:22:09.160 --> 3:22:14.200]  your facility. But in any case, they started out with four and they were shocked because it was
[3:22:14.200 --> 3:22:20.280]  in Ontario. It was all in this one hospital. Then it became six. Then the next number I saw was
[3:22:20.280 --> 3:22:27.640]  18. And now it's over 30 Canadian doctors dead. Now the other point is it's not just that who
[3:22:27.640 --> 3:22:33.480]  it's not that they're just doctors in dead. I mean, doctors die like everybody else.
[3:22:33.480 --> 3:22:38.440]  But when you look at the age of doctors dying and who they are, I mean, one of them was a
[3:22:38.440 --> 3:22:44.680]  competitive swimmer. There was a triathlete. These are young, healthy 30 year old people, 30,
[3:22:44.680 --> 3:22:49.960]  40, some 50 year olds. But these are not your standard in memoriam. In fact, they looked at
[3:22:49.960 --> 3:22:56.200]  that the Canadian Medical Association has an in memoriam website. And now it's being kind of
[3:22:56.200 --> 3:23:04.040]  altered. They still have data in the past, but they're not putting up the real time data for 2022.
[3:23:04.040 --> 3:23:09.400]  This is a classic thing they do. So the data for the doctor deaths hasn't been put up for the last
[3:23:09.400 --> 3:23:19.400]  couple months. But here's the numbers with one extrapolation that 2019 prorated was 170 deaths
[3:23:19.400 --> 3:23:25.160]  because they only reported part of the year we had. But anyway, if you think 2019 was probably
[3:23:25.160 --> 3:23:35.240]  170 deaths, 2020 was 246 deaths, 2021 was 393 deaths. That's not an advertisement for a vaccine
[3:23:35.240 --> 3:23:40.760]  program to decrease mortality. Now, the other again, and the other point is, these are not
[3:23:40.760 --> 3:23:46.760]  85 year old doctors. When you go back in time, and you don't see younger doctors among those
[3:23:46.760 --> 3:23:53.880]  among this group. You know, and then the other question is why are the deaths mainly in Ontario?
[3:23:53.880 --> 3:24:01.480]  Did they get all the same batch? And I tried to find, I'm working on trying to find AMA deaths.
[3:24:01.480 --> 3:24:04.920]  Me just mentioning this now, they're going to scrub it probably, but in any case,
[3:24:04.920 --> 3:24:10.280]  the AMA probably has the same thing. The AMA don't think they represent all doctors. When I was in
[3:24:10.280 --> 3:24:19.480]  practice, and this is up until 2009, I think, only 13% of doctors in practice were members of the AMA.
[3:24:19.480 --> 3:24:24.920]  They horn swagger medical students to be members, but generally doctors realize the corrupt
[3:24:24.920 --> 3:24:30.440]  organization for what it is, and they get out. But in any case, I have a feeling it's going to be
[3:24:30.440 --> 3:24:37.000]  less now because of their push of the vaccine. Now, Chris Sky up in Canada, who's been right
[3:24:37.000 --> 3:24:43.000]  on top of things, and Mark Stein have both reported that the leading cause of death in Alberta
[3:24:43.000 --> 3:24:50.520]  is now unknown. And of course, the very funny kind of part of this report is tragic funny,
[3:24:50.520 --> 3:24:55.560]  is that the symptoms of this new disease, because it used to be cardiac disease,
[3:24:56.200 --> 3:25:02.520]  heart attacks, strokes, cancer, those are the leading causes of death. Now it's
[3:25:02.520 --> 3:25:08.760]  unknown. And what are the symptoms of this new disease? And they are unknown. So it's,
[3:25:08.760 --> 3:25:16.120]  so there you have it. But it's, you know, and we still have athletes dying. Now we have the
[3:25:16.120 --> 3:25:20.840]  there's an anti vaccine. I think this is fairly recently, at least I just heard about it, this
[3:25:20.840 --> 3:25:25.560]  Olympic gold medalist I may mispronounce his name is Sylvester Scolini or something like that. He
[3:25:25.560 --> 3:25:31.480]  was a gymnast. And you see a picture of him and he is a super fit guy. I mean, he's like on the
[3:25:31.480 --> 3:25:38.840]  on the rings, you know, in gymnastics, dies at 51 after getting a vaccine. He was he was against
[3:25:38.840 --> 3:25:43.960]  the vaccine, but something coerced him I guess to get the vaccine and then he was dead. Morticians,
[3:25:43.960 --> 3:25:49.880]  there he is. Yeah, you know, you think he just went to see it at 51. I doubt it. Okay, these are
[3:25:49.880 --> 3:25:55.080]  healthy people that are that are crumping. Morticians are now reporting that 50 to 70% of the
[3:25:55.080 --> 3:26:00.280]  recently deceased have clots. Now, when they're reporting clots, this is not like when we report
[3:26:00.280 --> 3:26:04.440]  clots in medicine, we say, oh, you know, we did an MRI and we saw where you might have had an old
[3:26:04.440 --> 3:26:08.760]  stroke a long time ago because of that's because of a small clot in your occipital region or something
[3:26:08.760 --> 3:26:13.720]  like that. No, no, morticians are reporting clots because they can't pass the fluid through the veins.
[3:26:13.720 --> 3:26:20.040]  These are not many clots. These are macro clots. And I looked up, you know, you've heard the story
[3:26:20.040 --> 3:26:28.920]  about the soccer players or what they call footballers in Europe. And I was told by a friend
[3:26:28.920 --> 3:26:35.720]  of mine who is very soccer savvy and, you know, international traveler kind of person works over
[3:26:35.720 --> 3:26:41.720]  there. He said that 10 soccer teams are now absent, essentially the equivalent that number of players
[3:26:41.720 --> 3:26:47.000]  have either been disabled or died. The equivalent 10 soccer teams are gone in fight in the in the
[3:26:47.640 --> 3:26:52.600]  professional leagues. But if you actually look at some numbers, you can find FIFA keeps a
[3:26:52.600 --> 3:27:02.040]  a like a tally of players that die during the plays, okay, on the field. And it's very interesting
[3:27:02.040 --> 3:27:12.920]  that 21 players died in 2021. Okay, no numbers yet on 2022, but 21 players in 2021, three in 2020,
[3:27:13.560 --> 3:27:22.280]  10 in 2019. In fact, I went back and these numbers actually go back to 1889. And up until this year,
[3:27:22.280 --> 3:27:29.640]  every year up until 2021, it was three to 10 players died. Okay, in 1999.
[3:27:31.960 --> 3:27:37.640]  Something changed because after that, it was three to 10 players. But before that, it was
[3:27:37.640 --> 3:27:42.120]  zero to three deaths, there was years that had no deaths. And when you looked at the
[3:27:42.120 --> 3:27:47.400]  deaths before 1999, they were things like a crossbar fell on his head on the playing field,
[3:27:47.400 --> 3:27:54.680]  struck by lightning collided on the field. The heart stuff really started to be noticeable.
[3:27:54.680 --> 3:28:03.000]  You can read this yourself in 2002 to 2003. So we may think that COVID vaccine rollout started
[3:28:03.000 --> 3:28:10.120]  in 2021. Whatever's happening, I think it started along. We know, we know, look at Guillaume Barre
[3:28:10.120 --> 3:28:14.920]  syndrome, I never saw it as a medical student is something you read as a, as a, as a student to
[3:28:14.920 --> 3:28:22.920]  learn about, but you never heard about it. But don't worry on all this. It's, I'm sorry, Guillaume
[3:28:22.920 --> 3:28:29.240]  Barre, it gets worse because as time has gone on, it has been getting worse as we've seen flu
[3:28:29.240 --> 3:28:33.240]  shots. So I don't think this all started with that. Now, when we come back, I'm going to tell you
[3:28:33.240 --> 3:28:39.880]  what the FDA and the CDC director are saying, in spite of all this death and destruction.
[3:28:39.880 --> 3:28:47.640]  And then we'll talk finally about what to do. Thank you. See you in a little bit.
[3:28:55.640 --> 3:28:59.480]  It's the fourth coin that we've released the last year.

[3:32:52.520 --> 3:33:01.880]  stock infowarstore.com. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order,
[3:33:01.880 --> 3:33:03.400]  it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:12.120 --> 3:33:17.000]  Okay, so we were talking about the numbers of the soccer players and everybody
[3:33:18.680 --> 3:33:25.000]  having death and destruction from the vaccine rollout. But don't worry, the FDA has been doing a
[3:33:25.000 --> 3:33:31.000]  very careful analysis of the COVID vaccine damage. And they've been doing it using a technique called
[3:33:31.000 --> 3:33:38.840]  Bayesian data mining. The Epic Times apparently asked the FDA for the data. And the FDA says,
[3:33:38.840 --> 3:33:43.320]  nope, it's privileged information. We're the executive branch of the government.
[3:33:44.680 --> 3:33:50.200]  Now keep, so those of us that are being attacked by our medical boards for disinformation,
[3:33:50.920 --> 3:33:54.840]  find it a little hard to believe that it's okay to hide the data and then tell us we're
[3:33:54.840 --> 3:33:59.960]  selling the wrong things. Remember when the FDA also went with Pfizer together, hand in hand,
[3:33:59.960 --> 3:34:05.800]  to the courts to hide their data to say, no, no, we don't have to show you the data for 75 years.
[3:34:05.800 --> 3:34:11.000]  Well, they lost that. And I'm going to show a couple things that came out of that data and
[3:34:11.000 --> 3:34:18.920]  why they wanted it to be hidden. But this is obviously not accidental. It's absolutely programmed.
[3:34:18.920 --> 3:34:23.880]  And while this is all going on, you've got Rachel Walensky, who's the CDC director tweeting out
[3:34:23.880 --> 3:34:28.840]  things like this. She says, quote, the benefits best of this time about the vaccine, of course,
[3:34:28.840 --> 3:34:34.600]  the benefits vastly outweigh the risk. Vaccination will prevent illnesses and deaths from COVID-19
[3:34:34.600 --> 3:34:40.760]  that far exceed the number of generally mild myocarditis cases expected. Talk to your doctor
[3:34:40.760 --> 3:34:46.680]  if you have concerns. Well, good luck with that because they've the in and not completely the
[3:34:46.680 --> 3:34:51.480]  doctor's fault, the average guy on the street, really, I kind of paying them for not reading
[3:34:51.480 --> 3:34:56.680]  the literature. But really, they've got they've they've made it so hard to practice medicine.
[3:34:56.680 --> 3:35:00.600]  They've all become employees. They've all they're all like on a clock and they've got to see so
[3:35:00.600 --> 3:35:04.520]  many patients and they've got to do all these things. They don't have time to read. They're not
[3:35:04.520 --> 3:35:11.320]  doing their due diligence because they're being used like, you know, like cattle. And I and I
[3:35:11.320 --> 3:35:17.960]  have to say, I have a lot of sympathy with that, but it's time to read guys. Now, Johns Hopkins,
[3:35:17.960 --> 3:35:23.400]  I have to give them this credit, although it's too little too late. They just came out with a study
[3:35:23.400 --> 3:35:30.680]  that said that to prevent one hospitalization, you'd need to vaccinate 22 to 30,000 young adults.
[3:35:30.680 --> 3:35:36.680]  And in the process of doing that, you're going to have between 18 and 98 serious adverse events.
[3:35:36.680 --> 3:35:42.680]  That was the numbers out of their paper. Now, I appreciate this group in Johns Hopkins coming
[3:35:42.680 --> 3:35:47.240]  out and and being allowed to publish. Keep in mind, there are guys around that knew all this.
[3:35:47.240 --> 3:35:51.080]  There are people talking about this. Many of us tried to publish things in the past
[3:35:51.080 --> 3:35:55.880]  during this outbreak to warn people and it wouldn't get published. It couldn't get published.
[3:35:55.880 --> 3:35:59.640]  So the fact that it's getting published now is kind of interesting. It says to me,
[3:35:59.640 --> 3:36:04.600]  the the uber lords in charge don't really care if this comes out now. So we'll let our that we'll
[3:36:04.600 --> 3:36:09.000]  let some people look okay and and and you know, maybe keep our institutions from not looking
[3:36:09.000 --> 3:36:13.240]  totally psychopathic. We'll let them publish some of the stuff, but it's too late because it's already
[3:36:13.240 --> 3:36:18.440]  the vaccines have already been rolled out for most people. Now, and and Johns Hopkins, where have
[3:36:18.440 --> 3:36:24.600]  they been in this whole thing besides the fact that they that they trained the they they they
[3:36:24.600 --> 3:36:32.280]  featured Frederick Gates, Dr. Gates in World War One. They trained him and you know, they came out
[3:36:32.280 --> 3:36:38.200]  vent 201 was run by partially by Johns Hopkins. They've been deep into this thing, but they came
[3:36:38.200 --> 3:36:45.400]  out with this good study. Now, I I really think though that if I were a student at a university
[3:36:45.400 --> 3:36:50.040]  that had a complication from a vaccine, I was forced to take by studying at that university.
[3:36:51.720 --> 3:36:57.240]  And I saw this article, I think less of of Johns Hopkins, I bet they I bet they forced their
[3:36:57.240 --> 3:37:03.800]  students to take the vaccines. The issue here above all else, in my opinion, is the mandates.
[3:37:03.800 --> 3:37:10.280]  It is absolutely unethical immoral all the time to force anybody into any kind of medical treatment.
[3:37:10.280 --> 3:37:15.960]  Now, these guys in the universities, including Johns Hopkins for a long time now, they've been
[3:37:15.960 --> 3:37:21.640]  accepting quietly. When you don't say anything that means you accept things, they quite they
[3:37:21.640 --> 3:37:25.960]  accepted the misrepresentation of the data and they accepted the fact there was no data.
[3:37:26.600 --> 3:37:32.920]  Okay, now we've we've actually seen now the the the data graphs coming out based on the
[3:37:32.920 --> 3:37:38.440]  bears that we do have with that shows you the lot numbers where they were distributed and what the
[3:37:38.440 --> 3:37:45.320]  side effects of the lot were Craig part of Cooper and his group by a really awesome job in taking
[3:37:45.320 --> 3:37:50.040]  this data and showing you what's going on. And what did he just one of his last things he showed
[3:37:50.040 --> 3:37:55.960]  first of all, he showed that there was a post marketing dose response curve. He showed that
[3:37:55.960 --> 3:38:02.200]  people were given toxic doses in a prescribed fashion. You could see the toxicity kind of
[3:38:02.200 --> 3:38:06.520]  work its way down like they were changing something in the vaccine based on these graphs.
[3:38:06.520 --> 3:38:13.240]  But now he's come out and he showed what he called the the mortality bomb. Okay, and it's a
[3:38:13.240 --> 3:38:20.600]  second wave of mortality. I think we have the graph somewhere that occurred only in five states.
[3:38:20.600 --> 3:38:26.520]  They occurred in Kentucky, Georgia, Tennessee, Minnesota and Michigan. And what they did was
[3:38:26.520 --> 3:38:34.520]  they subtracted out deaths within or the deaths that were attributable to the first vaccines
[3:38:34.520 --> 3:38:38.600]  or every story from the second vaccine. So if you took they say the Pfizer two dose regimen,
[3:38:39.320 --> 3:38:44.600]  they didn't want to get confused by the second dose. So they factored those doses out and they
[3:38:44.600 --> 3:38:49.720]  looked at states mortality after the vaccine. And there is a mortality that happens within the first
[3:38:49.720 --> 3:38:54.840]  four days and it extends for a couple, you know, six weeks after the big bump for six weeks, I
[3:38:54.840 --> 3:39:00.520]  believe it is after the vaccine is given to you. And then it drops way down. Now, if you look at
[3:39:00.520 --> 3:39:05.400]  California, for example, they have a big bump at the beginning, but they have no secondary bump.
[3:39:06.120 --> 3:39:11.240]  These five states all have this secondary mortality that occurred at six months.
[3:39:12.200 --> 3:39:18.040]  And I thought the six months was interesting because that's what we also saw in World War
[3:39:18.040 --> 3:39:22.520]  One after the rollout of the vaccines that they gave the troops and they gave the Native Americans
[3:39:22.520 --> 3:39:30.120]  and they started having the great pandemic six months later. Now, so we're, you know, and I
[3:39:30.120 --> 3:39:34.040]  have to ask where was Johns Hopkins or any of these other universities when they told us it was
[3:39:34.040 --> 3:39:40.840]  safe to give pregnant women these vaccines. Now, looking at when the vaccines first rolled out,
[3:39:40.840 --> 3:39:47.640]  Simone Gold asked those of us that were on an AFLDS, the American Frontline doctors who kind of
[3:39:47.640 --> 3:39:51.640]  look at some of the research stuff, what we knew about the status of the vaccine at that point,
[3:39:51.640 --> 3:39:56.440]  literally the day of the rollout practically it was, it came out the night before was the
[3:39:56.440 --> 3:40:02.760]  emergency use authorization documents. But anyone reading that, the EUA documents, anyone reading
[3:40:02.760 --> 3:40:08.760]  the previous literature about the testing of mRNA and how it was done knew that in the test
[3:40:08.760 --> 3:40:15.160]  group that they're reporting on this for the EUA, they excluded all pregnant women. So how could
[3:40:15.160 --> 3:40:20.200]  they come out and say it was safe? They excluded all but perfect specimens. In fact, in fact,
[3:40:20.200 --> 3:40:25.960]  when they looked at mRNA in the research arm and they were doing these things, they warned you not
[3:40:25.960 --> 3:40:30.440]  to be around. They warned the subjects not to even be around women of childbearing age. They were
[3:40:30.440 --> 3:40:38.040]  supposed to report those contacts. So you have to ask, why did these guys now come out with these
[3:40:38.040 --> 3:40:43.400]  papers? Why didn't somebody speak up now? We just heard Dr. Brigham talk about Dr. Malone. I've always
[3:40:43.400 --> 3:40:48.120]  questioned because I was on a podcast with him a long time ago when we asked him to sign a paper
[3:40:48.120 --> 3:40:53.080]  not to let this stuff happen. It was a European podcast when it was first going out in Europe.
[3:40:53.080 --> 3:40:56.360]  We said, let's stop this. Let's stop this. And he wasn't interested in stopping it back then.
[3:40:56.360 --> 3:41:02.360]  So why now? I kind of think it's post-rollout. They don't really care. But what do we know
[3:41:02.360 --> 3:41:11.000]  just in pregnant women? Here's in that 1,291 adverse event. It's report 5.3.6. In that
[3:41:11.000 --> 3:41:16.280]  adverse event report, here's what we know about pregnant women. There was a study that was done
[3:41:16.280 --> 3:41:24.440]  just after the rollout. It was a study of 270 women, Pfizer study. 238 were lost to follow-up. In any
[3:41:24.440 --> 3:41:30.120]  real world scientific endeavor, that would just negate the test. I mean, you can't report on
[3:41:30.120 --> 3:41:36.600]  something like that. But they did. And they tried to sugarcoat it and tried to rename things so they
[3:41:36.600 --> 3:41:41.480]  could come out with less bad numbers. But if you look at the reality here, if you took the vaccine,
[3:41:41.480 --> 3:41:47.000]  I think in the first trimester, or actually in general, it was an 82% loss of pregnancy.
[3:41:47.960 --> 3:41:54.280]  Now that's unbelievable. And of the 34 people that they were able to follow that weren't lost to
[3:41:54.280 --> 3:41:59.800]  follow-up, and it adds up a little bit more to the total because of twins, but 34 they followed.
[3:41:59.800 --> 3:42:07.560]  28 of the babies died in utero or at birth. At the time of the report, they could only prove one
[3:42:07.560 --> 3:42:13.640]  live normal birth in 270 women. But Walensky says it's safe and effective and keep doing it.
[3:42:15.880 --> 3:42:24.360]  Now, interesting data, and I know Colonel Long from the Army, and she's been talking to a lot
[3:42:24.360 --> 3:42:28.840]  of people, and she's been looking at the data herself. And she pointed this out to me that
[3:42:28.840 --> 3:42:37.480]  they, the DOD, actually created its own Myocarditis workup. And I'm going to talk about that when
[3:42:37.480 --> 3:42:41.160]  we get back, and then what we do to change our world.
[3:42:41.160 --> 3:43:03.720]  The rage for more than a decade have been concentrated green powders with wheatgrass and
[3:43:03.720 --> 3:43:09.080]  so many other ingredients that are known to make us healthy, to make us vibrant,
[3:43:09.080 --> 3:43:13.960]  and to defend our immune systems. Now, over a year and a half ago, we came out with a product
[3:43:13.960 --> 3:43:19.240]  that was top sourced, top of the line, as good as it's going to get, but then the supply chain
[3:43:19.240 --> 3:43:24.680]  broke down and it was sold out for more than a year. Finally, green fiber capsules, this big old

[3:45:00.360 --> 3:45:05.240]  you've got brain force plus, and you've got brain force ultra. Which one is better?
[3:45:05.960 --> 3:45:14.040]  And that's like asking, what's better, a Ford F-150, or a Cadillac, or a Ferrari?
[3:45:14.840 --> 3:45:19.640]  It's different strokes for different folks. It varies. All three are different formulas.
[3:45:20.280 --> 3:45:26.440]  All three do different things. Turbo force is 10 hours of clean, out of control energy.

[3:46:56.680 --> 3:47:02.600]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:02.600 --> 3:47:17.160]  All righty, and this is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show. I'm Dr. Lee Merritt. Thanks for
[3:47:17.160 --> 3:47:22.280]  coming back. I was talking about some of the information out of the Department of Defense,
[3:47:22.280 --> 3:47:28.440]  and specifically I was talking to Colonel Teresa Long recently. And, you know, she said that,
[3:47:28.440 --> 3:47:33.800]  and this is shocking actually, she said that she found that the Department of Defense had created
[3:47:33.800 --> 3:47:41.400]  a myocarditis workup of their own far in advance of this COVID outbreak, but they didn't disseminate
[3:47:41.400 --> 3:47:48.040]  it. And she also points out that when you look at the 1291 adverse events and the report that was
[3:47:48.040 --> 3:47:55.960]  purportedly about this rollout, this actual study, it really reads like it's a long-term
[3:47:55.960 --> 3:48:02.840]  experiment that was been done on people without their knowledge, maybe, because
[3:48:03.960 --> 3:48:09.320]  some of these diagnoses you cannot come up with in a short time. I mean, where diagnosis that
[3:48:09.320 --> 3:48:15.240]  you're seeing 200 of and I don't know, just things like shrinking lung disease, which I've never
[3:48:15.240 --> 3:48:22.120]  really, you know, understood or heard much about, certain gene deletions. I mean, how did they really
[3:48:22.120 --> 3:48:28.440]  do that in a short period of time, collect enough data? So it almost looks like this was more like a
[3:48:29.960 --> 3:48:34.040]  planned thing that had been going on for a long time. And that's what I, my point about these
[3:48:34.040 --> 3:48:39.480]  soccer players. Something changed in the world around 2000. When people started getting Guillain
[3:48:39.480 --> 3:48:45.400]  Barre, we started seeing things that we'd only read about before. And what was the common,
[3:48:45.400 --> 3:48:48.680]  what was, what was the thing that had been changing in the world? We'd been getting,
[3:48:48.680 --> 3:48:54.120]  that's really when the vaccines took off. I'm just going to say, I think that this has been,
[3:48:54.760 --> 3:49:00.040]  we've been dosed, not me, I didn't take vaccines for a long time. I'm sorry I ever gave them to
[3:49:00.040 --> 3:49:05.640]  my children, but that's, that is what it is. So now what do we do? Here's where we are right now.
[3:49:05.640 --> 3:49:09.400]  Oh, and by the way, the last thing I'll say about the military is a bunch of the military
[3:49:10.280 --> 3:49:15.400]  prevented medicine type doctors like Dr. Long and, and there are other doctors involved, Dr.
[3:49:15.400 --> 3:49:22.920]  Sigiloff, I know that, you know, they reported apparently to the FAA their concerns because,
[3:49:22.920 --> 3:49:27.080]  and I've been saying this since the get go, we are violating all the safety measures in the
[3:49:27.080 --> 3:49:32.920]  military for pilots. How, how can you be doing this? How can you use an experimental drug against
[3:49:32.920 --> 3:49:38.760]  pilots? It's right contradictory to the manual of the medical department. So, but they've been
[3:49:38.760 --> 3:49:44.360]  doing it. So they, they sent certified letters against to the FAA warning them and telling them,
[3:49:44.360 --> 3:49:49.720]  it's just a matter of time before you have an air, airline disaster. And we want to go on record
[3:49:49.720 --> 3:49:55.880]  saying we are warning you now, don't keep doing this. So good for them. I will see. I, I think
[3:49:55.880 --> 3:50:00.280]  there's already some evidence that we're having some problems with the airlines. Now I just want
[3:50:00.280 --> 3:50:04.120]  to finish this segment because this is my last segment on what we should really be doing, you
[3:50:04.120 --> 3:50:08.680]  know, what's happening. I tell you, my worldview has been completely upended by COVID. Now I question
[3:50:08.680 --> 3:50:14.840]  everything, even things I thought were, were absolutely proven. And I'll just make this opinion,
[3:50:14.840 --> 3:50:18.920]  this is my opinion that if the uber lords are pushing something, this is my new motto, the
[3:50:18.920 --> 3:50:23.480]  uber lords are pushing something like treatment for monkeypox. I don't care what it is, you can be
[3:50:23.480 --> 3:50:28.360]  guaranteed of two things. They're not being completely truthful. And whatever they're pushing
[3:50:28.360 --> 3:50:34.520]  is good for them and bad for us, i.e. humanity. So with that in mind, I think to change our world,
[3:50:34.520 --> 3:50:39.240]  we have to change our thinking and to change our thinking, we have to change our language based
[3:50:39.240 --> 3:50:44.680]  on what we absolutely understand. Now Thomas, Dr. Thomas Cowan, who has an excellent book on
[3:50:44.680 --> 3:50:49.640]  contagion that everybody should pick up and read to open your mind a little bit. That was one of
[3:50:49.640 --> 3:50:54.360]  my entries. He said in a recent lecture, if you don't know how something's proven, you can't assume
[3:50:54.360 --> 3:51:01.000]  someone proved it. I mean, now I'm even questioning what do we know about the basic double helix,
[3:51:01.000 --> 3:51:06.760]  you know, I thought that was proven. And it might be, but I don't quite understand how it was proven,
[3:51:06.760 --> 3:51:11.560]  and it's not as easy as I thought. So what is COVID? Okay, we can call it a disease.
[3:51:12.280 --> 3:51:17.640]  Dis-ease. What is disease? Dis-ease. It just means you're discomforted. It doesn't imply
[3:51:17.640 --> 3:51:22.920]  how it's caused, okay? So what do we absolutely know? Do we know that there's, have we done a
[3:51:22.920 --> 3:51:27.800]  systematic proofs of transmission of disease? You know, how do we know it's viral? Well,
[3:51:27.800 --> 3:51:34.920]  I gave you that, I talked last week or whenever about the 1918 pandemic. They really tried to
[3:51:34.920 --> 3:51:39.880]  prove transmission and couldn't do it. And I'm just going to show you one of, how they do it today
[3:51:39.880 --> 3:51:47.320]  versus how they did it then. There's a classic paper from 2004 about the guys who, theoretically,
[3:51:47.320 --> 3:51:54.040]  unearth these lungs from, from pandemic, 1918 pandemic victims in the Yukon or Alaska or some
[3:51:54.040 --> 3:51:59.640]  place that were from long frozen. They figured out who had died from the pandemic somehow. And
[3:51:59.640 --> 3:52:05.800]  then this is how they determined that it was, that this is what it was. They said, this is,
[3:52:05.800 --> 3:52:09.960]  I'm just going to show you this because it's not, there's a, you know, in fairness to them,
[3:52:09.960 --> 3:52:14.600]  they did this over six years, multiple papers, but this is the, this is just a little snippet
[3:52:14.600 --> 3:52:22.120]  to give you a flavor. Quote, the 1497 nucleotide open reading frame of gene segment five of
[3:52:22.120 --> 3:52:28.120]  strain A brevig mission one slash 18 was amplified in 18 overlapping fragments varying in length from
[3:52:28.120 --> 3:52:34.920]  119 to 139 nucleotides. Each fragment was reverse transcribed, amplified in sequence at least twice,
[3:52:34.920 --> 3:52:40.840]  reverse transcription, PCR, isolation of products and sequencing have been described previously.
[3:52:40.840 --> 3:52:46.440]  A list of primers is used available upon request. Now, you know, I always read that as well as
[3:52:46.440 --> 3:52:50.920]  this highly technical. I don't know anything about it. So I'll just trust them. Well, but then you
[3:52:50.920 --> 3:52:56.360]  but then you read things like this, which again, these are also smart doctors in a little earlier
[3:52:56.360 --> 3:53:01.480]  time, but this is from the actual 1918 pandemic. And this is what they say they're trying to prove
[3:53:01.480 --> 3:53:08.200]  transmission. And they said, quote, the inoculation was made by spraying the nose and throat and by
[3:53:08.200 --> 3:53:14.440]  installation into the nose. In the case of these men or five of these men, a drop or two of the
[3:53:14.440 --> 3:53:19.160]  infiltrate was also instilled into each eye. In all, each of the men received not less than
[3:53:19.160 --> 3:53:25.160]  five ccs of the filtrate in both the groups of men receiving the crude and that receiving the
[3:53:25.160 --> 3:53:30.840]  filtered secretions, some if all, if not all of the men in all probabilities swallowed some of
[3:53:30.840 --> 3:53:34.840]  the material. Okay, that's English, right? We understand what they did. These are volunteers.
[3:53:34.840 --> 3:53:40.120]  They had 118 volunteers of well people and they were trying to prove transmission of the pandemic
[3:53:40.120 --> 3:53:46.920]  of 1918 results with one exception, none of the above two groups of men developed any unpleasant
[3:53:46.920 --> 3:53:52.040]  effects. In other words, they couldn't prove transmission. The one exception by the way was
[3:53:52.040 --> 3:53:58.200]  volunteer number 29 inoculated with unfiltered, unfiltered secretions about 36 hours after the
[3:53:58.200 --> 3:54:03.560]  inoculation, his temperature rose and remained above normal for a week. Subjectively, he made
[3:54:03.560 --> 3:54:10.520]  almost no complaint. So they tried to make people sick. They couldn't prove it. But these guys
[3:54:10.520 --> 3:54:17.160]  out of a dead body, took a PCR, took primers, got genetic sequences and claimed that is what caused
[3:54:17.160 --> 3:54:23.000]  the 1918 pandemic. Do you see the problem with that? It's not just about finding something in
[3:54:23.000 --> 3:54:28.520]  somebody. That would be like me going out on the French battlefield after crazy and seeing blood on
[3:54:28.520 --> 3:54:35.960]  or mud on all the dead people's face and say, oh my gosh, mud caused the deaths here. We can't have
[3:54:35.960 --> 3:54:40.760]  mud on our face. That's what causes deaths in war. No, no, no. It's not, you know, there's a big logical
[3:54:40.760 --> 3:54:45.320]  disconnect. So here's the thing I'm going to tell you. What do we know? We know that the world is
[3:54:45.320 --> 3:54:51.800]  filled with toxins and the toxins can give you disease. In Latin, virus means toxin. In the
[3:54:51.800 --> 3:54:57.080]  ancient art of medicine, nobody had to differentiate and do all this complicated stuff to try and
[3:54:57.800 --> 3:55:04.040]  make you believe a certain little virus, you can't see, prove, isolate, whatever is causing this.
[3:55:04.040 --> 3:55:11.560]  They just knew that it was toxins. And, you know, in the category of this war is local. All wars
[3:55:11.560 --> 3:55:16.920]  are ultimately local. We know about the toxins. I can't get the fluoride out of my town's water.
[3:55:16.920 --> 3:55:21.880]  We are now getting sprayed with insecticide for mosquitoes in September. Are you kidding me?
[3:55:21.880 --> 3:55:27.640]  By the state? Why? We're in a drought. There's no mosquitoes. I mean, things are, we're being
[3:55:27.640 --> 3:55:33.000]  toxified every time we look, not to mention GMO foods. So everybody locally needs to look at their
[3:55:33.000 --> 3:55:38.200]  own life and what they can fight on a local level. One of the big toxins, electromagnetic
[3:55:38.200 --> 3:55:45.560]  frequencies. Now, I just had a podcast with Corey Hill from EMF, Saul, and that's a link on my
[3:55:45.560 --> 3:55:54.600]  website. Trust me, EMF is not benign. We knew it from 19, you know, 30s on at least, probably before
[3:55:54.600 --> 3:55:59.880]  that, because we knew about telegraphers disease in the 1800s. So you need to understand EMF. You
[3:55:59.880 --> 3:56:07.960]  need to protect yourself and the many other toxins. There's lots of, we need to take on the toxins.
[3:56:07.960 --> 3:56:12.600]  Parasites exist. They're universal. And we've been lied to about the importance of parasites
[3:56:12.600 --> 3:56:18.040]  in the first world. Take it seriously. Learn about parasites. Those are two big things.
[3:56:18.040 --> 3:56:27.240]  Don't eat their toxic foods. Don't be afraid of, and don't be afraid of the lies about these
[3:56:27.240 --> 3:56:32.840]  various diseases. Do you see what's happening, for example, with monkeypox? It's a joke. I mean,
[3:56:32.840 --> 3:56:39.000]  monkeypox is not funny to people that may get it and die, but it's not proven to be a virus.
[3:56:39.000 --> 3:56:44.680]  Who's it happening in? People who were multiply vaccinated, whose immune systems may be damaged
[3:56:44.680 --> 3:56:48.920]  at the time they were vaccinated. In other words, the gay population. They're the ones getting it.
[3:56:50.040 --> 3:56:55.400]  Who's getting polio? Now they're saying, oh, there's an outbreak of polio. Really? Polio.
[3:56:55.400 --> 3:57:00.760]  In the old days, it was DDT spraying in the cities. That's what they're looking at now.
[3:57:00.760 --> 3:57:08.680]  So don't let them lie to you. Don't be afraid. They love fear. That's part of the Uber Lourdes
[3:57:08.680 --> 3:57:16.600]  plan is to always divide us. We are not each other's enemies. Don't get mad at each other.
[3:57:16.600 --> 3:57:21.560]  Get mad at them. That's what we need to do. Don't be afraid. We need to win this war against
[3:57:21.560 --> 3:57:26.600]  humanity and we need to do it through knowledge. So thank you very much. I hope to see you again.
[3:57:26.600 --> 3:57:37.480]  And thanks for Alex for having me on tonight.
[3:57:37.480 --> 3:57:52.520]  Everybody knows that high quality fish oil does fantastic things for your cardiovascular system,
[3:57:52.520 --> 3:57:58.520]  for your brain, for every part of your body. But what I don't see being promoted is the fact that
[3:57:58.520 --> 3:58:05.800]  it has natural psychotropic effects. It certainly does for me. When I take a couple of these

[3:58:45.800 --> 3:58:51.240]  The globalists are fighting around the clock to destroy the family, to destroy heterosexual
[3:58:51.240 --> 3:58:57.640]  relationships, to annihilate our marriages and the studies are all clear. The number one cause of
[3:58:57.640 --> 3:59:04.200]  marital splits is that there's problems in the bedroom and the number one issue men have is
[3:59:04.200 --> 3:59:09.320]  erectile dysfunction. Ladies and gentlemen, the left makes big jokes about this because they
[3:59:09.320 --> 3:59:14.120]  don't want people having lasting good love and relationships. They want to break up society.
[3:59:14.120 --> 3:59:21.080]  And we are so excited to have the number one natural male enhancement pill in the world
