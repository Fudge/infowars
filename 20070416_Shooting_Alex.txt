[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400]  What you're witnessing? Blacksburg, Virginia. I'm on the campus of Virginia Tech and woke up this
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:12.640]  morning to loudspeakers going off saying that there is a shooter on campus. Please stay inside.
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.440]  And they just put up this big loudspeaker system because we had another school shooting a while
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:23.120]  back at the beginning, the first day of the school year. A guy went nuts and shot a couple of cops.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.720]  This is the this is the real deal there the first report was that there were two shooters
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:37.760]  and always the same it's oh my god two shooters total work oh my god so then basically then what
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:44.320]  what it's shaped into so far is that there was a guy who shot three people at aj dorm which is just
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.600]  oh it's about a half mile from here and then fled across campus went into a classroom and
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.280]  killed everybody and then killed himself is the word and i bet money if the cops would have
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.880]  scrambled immediately they could have seen this guy running around with a gun they should have
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.600]  just attacked him i just i just cannot believe i mean i'm sorry folks i've studied this stuff
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.520]  when people try this in the past the cops just killed them i mean the cops didn't used to be
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:14.000]  like this i just can't believe it well this is crazy because we've had four uh bomb threats
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.280]  this week on the same street there was another bomb threat today and they had to evacuate all
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.040]  these rescue vehicles because of another bomb threat i mean they pulled out the whole
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.920]  there was every cop in three counties out here just the other day right on this very street
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.760]  well that shows listen this has got black op written all over it that's right i remember
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.520]  hearing about the last shooting you've got a shooting there in this little rural area
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.960]  then another one weird bomb threats oh my god you've got it somebody's got to get to the school
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.200]  surveillance camera tapes and databanks i bet you're going to see a lot of suspicious people
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.480]  in there now they're saying they've killed the shooter now is that is that what they're saying
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.520]  no what i heard last was that he had killed himself and they've kind of dropped the two
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.920]  shooter thing that i haven't heard anything else about that and it looks from the activities of the
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:04.320]  police it looks like it's over uh there's a big there was a big shift let me ask you let me ask
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.760]  you what's your gut on this map i you know i don't know yet alex i'm gonna have to wait and
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.960]  hear how it all rolls out all i can tell you is what i've heard so far and i've never seen anything
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.400]  like this in this town and i will say this it's been very strange week living where i'm living
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.520]  because like i said just a couple of days ago every cop in three counties and the i mean all
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.440]  of the they were all in their uh swat gear and everything somebody's been calling in bomb threats
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:38.320]  all week and um i don't know it's kind of isn't that kind of strange well that could be the crazy
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.880]  person or it could be somebody inside intelligence that didn't want this black cop to go forward
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:50.960]  bottom line maybe up to 35 people 35 now dead yeah i just saw that during the break they were
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:57.600]  saying over 30 this is absolutely disgusting look immediately it's time to rearm the pilots
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.000]  it is time because they were armed they could be armed before 9 11 two months before they
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.920]  changed the law very suspicious it's time that if a professor wants to have a gun that there be a
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:17.120]  secured lock box they go take some certification course there be a secured lock box underneath uh
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:24.480]  their uh table or desk and uh it's time to trust the citizenry again and this piece of garbage
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.120]  might have been able to kill four or five people but i guarantee you every other professor would
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.160]  want to go and they to kill this son of a bitch i'm sorry to talk like that but people been killed
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.200]  and i'm tired of it and stay there matt because stay there matt i want to get you on on the other

[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.160]  total distraction but it is important and it's either a complete nut or it has a lot of telltale
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.960]  earmarks of a black op now you're there living on campus a block away from where a lot of this
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:22.400]  happened you're right in the middle of it start with what you heard what you saw what the first
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:28.560]  media reports were walk us through it take your time all right um this morning uh i woke up to
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.960]  a loudspeaker going off i thought it was somebody driving by with a bullhorn actually
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.200]  but i found out that they had just installed these loudspeakers across campus
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.960]  because of the last school shooting that we had which was the first day of the school year
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:48.080]  and um this the stop right there let's go back and detail that one okay actually i knew this
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:55.280]  guy he was a kid who um went to high school around here everybody knew this kid um his brother fought
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:03.360]  in um the afghanistan war um they got in a little bit of trouble uh they listen his brother uh tried
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:09.360]  to rob an atm machine and he was involved with some other type of robbery he broke out of jail
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:17.840]  killed um maybe three people two of them were cops and uh the the brother um like i said because he
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:24.400]  was his brother and involves apparently involved in this they just gave him 35 years um but so we've
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.040]  this the whole community has been shook up by this terrible tragedy that we just had and uh
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:37.680]  and today so it all starts with a afghan operator an american troop had been in combat
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.800]  he was that was the brother of the shooter i understand but it's all tied into that
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:49.600]  now just like with the tower please continue um anyway so uh they had installed these loudspeakers
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:55.040]  that's what i heard this morning was um um basically an alert a warning that there is a
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:01.600]  shooter on campus please stay indoors stay off the street stay away from windows um i heard that for
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:07.280]  maybe 20 minutes before it actually hit the news and when when the news came on it was that there
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:14.480]  was a shooter on campus um that maybe two people or three people had been shot but um no confirmation
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:21.840]  of any of that and as it developed we were just flooded with ambulances and rescued the whole swat
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:26.400]  team showing up right out and very close by here and we went out and started talking to people on
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:31.440]  the street to find out what was going on well this is also a victim disarmament zone because
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:36.960]  under federal law none of the citizens can have guns that live on campus so it's a perfect place
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:44.080]  for a black cop because nobody's got guns please continue um yes and uh it was um basically pretty
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:49.520]  well known early on that there the first word was that there were multiple shooters and i think that
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:57.120]  had to do with how many people it was being reported that uh were killed and um he he killed
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:02.480]  three people or at least shot three people uh killed at least one of those three i think maybe
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:09.040]  all three a few blocks away from here i'm making a prediction i'm a guesstimation i bet he's going
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:16.080]  to be an iraq or afghan vet yeah well we'll see if that comes true you never know because if they're
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:23.200]  not going to be our cops about the rotc by the way oh it happened by the rotc oh go it's literally
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:28.960]  half a block away from the rotc buildings and all the rtc dorms yeah it's the military and and watch
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:33.520]  he's going to be disappeared the last few months and then we'll dig out that he was at a special
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:40.080]  installation being given psychiatric care because no this happens over and over again oh i'm sorry
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:46.640]  please continue no no no um i'll tell you what i did hear about that was that it was a kid who
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:51.440]  was going to a specific classroom now this is this is not confirmed this was one of the last things
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.920]  that i heard it was a kid going to a specific classroom because of whatever some people were
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:01.600]  making fun of him or whatever so they're now saying it's a trench coat mafia type deal
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:07.840]  uh that's what the media is not saying anything locally as far as whether they've actually got
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:12.080]  the guy or not but stay there stay there tell us more on the other side eyewitness

[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:28.080]  mind all right huge new 911 truth developments with rosie o'donnell i haven't even had a chance
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:36.720]  to get to yet because this mass shooting it could be as many as 34 dead the number continues to go
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:41.360]  up i kept saying on air folks you're going to have some university or high school shooting it
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:46.160]  could be as many as 100 dead that's what i've been saying in the past because these black ops
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:51.600]  are just bad news not to mention all the brainwashed drug addict youth that is just
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:57.280]  snorting methamphetamine and playing 15 hours of video games a day where all they do is mass shoot
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:04.960]  people those were developed by the pentagon to instinctively block uh the inhibition towards
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:12.080]  splattering innocent people and it just instinctive firing and um because in the past going back 30 40
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:17.200]  50 years you had a few mass shooters but they start shooting little kids or women and children
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:21.120]  in a mcdonald's and they start getting you know throwing up getting sick because you're you're
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:25.440]  built not to do that you're built to feel good when somebody attacks you and they're big and bad
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:30.320]  and you know you strike back and they hit the ground uh i mean that's instinctively i mean
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:35.040]  your your design really have almost morals built into you then when you break that code i guess and
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:41.120]  then sin against you know your very nature i don't know how to explain it the point is i'm i'm getting
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:47.440]  off into just how people operate uh it's just absolutely amazing that they had victim disarmament
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:54.560]  total gun ban on all the campuses in america i had a friend one time who was ut campus is just
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:15:01.040]  giant and he was walking across just the corner of campus and uh the uh cop saw that he had a
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:05.760]  fanny pack and he had a concealed carry they walked over they said what is that he said oh
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:09.200]  that's my concealed carry and they said boom up against the wall put it up against the bus stop
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:15.680]  and he was literally about 10 feet on the campus they just wait lurking to get our best and brightest
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.920]  and most upright citizens by the way all the gun grabbers we're about to go back to our guest
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:27.200]  i'm going to go back to uh mark um because he there uh who uh is on campus ladies and gentlemen
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:31.600]  literally just a block from where the shooting was going on uh we're going to be talking to him
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:36.800]  in just a moment but i had another friend who didn't who had forgotten about the federal law
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:43.120]  and i was uh walking across campus and uh going to a patriot meeting and uh some cops showed up
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:47.600]  because he was giving people silver eight dollar but the time little silver pieces ten dollar
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:51.760]  pieces were really worth about eight bucks he was showing them to people uh you know liberty money
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:56.320]  and going oh look at this great and the cops thought that was illegal and then came to arrest
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:59.680]  him for just they thought it was counterfeit they thought you're not allowed to have
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:06.480]  silver struck non you know other than the government remember the guy who um uh
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:11.920]  went and bought like a 50 item at best buy with two dollar bills and the clerks thought it was
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:16.320]  illegal the manager thought it was illegal they were all so dumb that they thought that was
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:20.000]  counterfeit you see that's one reason they want to dumb us down and a lot of the public folks
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.240]  is literally retarded now they've been conditioned to nothing but entertainment
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:29.280]  so they never have any of their own thoughts and they're totally dumb and uh remember that case he
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:33.760]  went to jail they went ahead and arrested him the cops thought it was fake too they none of the cops
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:38.640]  that showed up and then of course the higher ups what you idiots letting go two dollar bills what
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:43.040]  are you talking about you know they've got them signing a declaration of independence on the back
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:50.160]  they're really neat i've got a couple of them it's just unbelievable ladies and gentlemen that
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:57.360]  i've had to go speak at ut while i was getting death threats and while really scary people
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:04.560]  were coming around i mean i mean you talk about uh and i had a police officer bodyguard there and
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:09.280]  he couldn't even one of my listeners i never had bodyguards in the past but there was a guy in a
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:12.800]  black trench coat going around he went to another meeting i was at and was pulling his hand out and
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:17.520]  pointing it at me like it was a gun at the back of the i mean really scaring everybody so i did
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.560]  everybody's like no you gotta have a bodyguard you gotta have a bodyguard so i said okay i'll
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:25.200]  get one couldn't have a gun i mean even a cop couldn't have a gun on their off duty on federal
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:31.920]  property on god property you know state property under federal law uh so that's how it works folks
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:37.520]  and uh that's how america operates everybody's like wear a bulletproof vest i'm like no i'm not
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.960]  going to wear a bulletproof vest i'm frankly not worried about it i don't want to die but
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:45.920]  i'm just i'm not worried about i'm not going to live in fear and uh you know that's just the way
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:51.840]  it is uh but uh the cop was wearing a bulletproof vest he was just going to tackle he actually had
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:57.440]  two cops there but i'm already digressing and some other people but um then that's a real cop
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:03.120]  you know ready to tackle somebody um but uh and of course you have the ut police they're totally
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:07.840]  worthless i mean literally folks when there's a shooter they run and hide and and that basically
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:11.040]  happened here but i'm going to shut up let's play about a minute and a half clip of somebody
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:15.280]  on a cell phone with the gunshots going off and we'll go back to our eyewitness guest here it is
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:28.400]  okay uh jamal albert goodie is i believe on the phone with us now and jamal uh pretty
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:32.880]  unbelievable pictures that you have there i i'm i'm hoping it was a little frightening
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:38.880]  watching because it seemed like you were pretty darn close we first heard a series of shots we see
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:45.280]  the officers um can't tell if those shots are coming from their guns or from uh possibly the
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:50.560]  person inside the building or outside of the building uh tell us what you were able to see
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:58.400]  with your own naked eye well the first thing i saw is when the policemen started taking their guns
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:04.720]  out and then i knew that this was serious i really didn't hear anything about the shooting
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:12.000]  that happened in aj but when i saw the guns i knew that this isn't another bumper um then i
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:18.720]  started hearing some gunshots far away um it was then it seemed to me that they were not at norris
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:29.280]  hall the building you were where the cops were just near right now um and then all the cops were
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:36.480]  trying to get into norris hall and they used like a bomb or something to open one of the doors or
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:43.920]  they or probably they dropped a tear bomb in the building and there was a person in the building
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:50.960]  trying in the second floor at norris trying to tell the cops that he's in there and probably
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:55.840]  trying to guide them in now jamal did were you able to hear that person and again just to be
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:01.120]  clear for our viewers this is apparently norris hall the site of the second shooting that took
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:06.320]  place uh virginia tech this morning uh jamal you were able to hear some type of conversation
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:11.200]  between somebody on the second floor and the police officers outside well i wasn't but i saw
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:17.280]  his hand uh from the window he was trying to reach outside the window to talk to the cops
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:25.200]  so this is what i saw i didn't actually hear him talking to them but he was well he was he was
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:31.520]  um talking to them i did not hear what he said i was a little bit far away from there all right
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:36.000]  now after we see the pictures here that you were able to capture with your cell phone we see that
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.280]  you actually moved quite a bit closer as the police went on down i assume inside the building
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:48.960]  what happened after all that um well i i wasn't able to see anything because the cop came from
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:55.760]  behind me and he asked me to leave the area i imagine so for your safety obviously uh where
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:21:01.280]  are you going to our eyewitness who lives on campus he is a 9-11 truther and he reminded me
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:06.240]  that he has called in for the show before and again ladies and gentlemen this is happening at
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:18.960]  the virginia tech college there in um the west ambler johnston hall this is absolutely horrible
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:25.680]  uh they're saying it can be well over 34 people dead now the number is just climbing now going
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:34.880]  back to our guest matt z or cozy matt thank you for coming on with us please continue and again
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:40.480]  go back to the start those are all the facets what you heard the other bomb threats uh and
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:44.960]  then detail what happened today you got the floor i would have to say that with the whole town has
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:49.360]  been on a little bit of tension because for the past week we've had multiple bomb threats this
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:54.160]  happened a week ago we had cleared out campus right over here where this where the second
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:22:01.440]  shooting was then they had at the end of the week i guess this was probably uh it was probably
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:06.240]  friday i'm not sure but at the end of the week they had another they had three multiple bomb
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:12.480]  threats in one day and they brought in every vehicle that they could um they had the whole
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:18.560]  place covered so in some ways uh swat has been over and has covered this little area where all
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:24.240]  of this happened for the past week and they stayed until about 9 30 10 o'clock that night and
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:29.440]  nothing ever came from it the campus put out a five thousand dollar reward for any information
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:37.440]  hadn't heard anything today um we all know what happened uh it hit the fan that's for sure um i
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:41.520]  just heard that report on on the phone there and it sounded like that they were saying that he was
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:46.320]  trying to holler to the police through from the window or something like that um well basically
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:50.880]  the individual is going around taking his time killing all the people that were told stay indoors
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:55.760]  that they do the exact opposite and so it looks like that there you know there were people jumping
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:23:00.320]  out and other things people saying hey he's in here help us while he's going around you know
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:05.440]  killing people who knows by then what really happened and we'll probably never know you know
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:10.720]  for a year or so then we found out what happened at colin mine i mean do you really believe harris
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:18.320]  and kleibold were able to get over 100 it was 124 bombs some of them uh you know you know huge 60
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:24.960]  something gallon uh tanks of propane that two people could hardly carry and butane that they
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:30.320]  were able just to take 120 something bombs into there and that and that half the school more than
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:35.120]  half was empty that day then the security was just gone that day and they were able just to bring in
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:40.080]  100 and something bombs i mean this is and then both and then by the way both their parents did
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:45.600]  high level government work very classified positions very suspicious that the son of an fbi
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:50.240]  agent founded the trench coat mafia two years before harrison kleibold made a video for the
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:55.280]  school they ran the school's internet of how they were going to kill everyone i mean you i mean what
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:24:00.160]  do you think about that my friend uh well yeah we that's that's impossible that they could get all
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:05.200]  those bombs in there that day we know that we also know how many kids got uh killed by men in black
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:10.320]  that day um i don't know if there were any shots fired by the way i know paul watson's doing an
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:15.440]  article on this paul type in at cbs news is the one i pulled it up when i was at a friend's house
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:18.000]  a few months ago i was telling him about it and he didn't believe it so i pulled it up it's
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:26.000]  something like uh hundreds of bombs at columbine and then it's 124 126 cbs news headline i think
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.960]  it's 124 memory serves go ahead sorry uh well i'm wondering now if we're going to find something
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:34.400]  like that with this because of the whole bomb threats it's a giant it's it'll be a
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:39.760]  giant bottom line it's either a giant provocateur at op or it's a pure government op or it's a
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:43.840]  mental patient but you know before i even knew about this last hour when i just had seen the
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:47.520]  article there was a mass shooting i said if we hear there's multiple shooters there's a whole
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:52.240]  bunch of people shot if there's any kind of drills involved uh or anything before it's a black op
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:25:00.400]  and uh this thing has black op oh my god oh my god all of the above sounds like to me oh my god
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:04.960]  well i hope it's not a black cop it's a lot more scary if it's the government but i mean we know
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:12.640]  the dc sniper that was total black off the jewish school thing it was black off with furrow we'll

[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.880]  done at this school i'm gonna tell you right now my children are not going to any of these colleges
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:49.920]  until they change the gun laws where at least the faculty can be armed period and they're not going
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:55.920]  to any public school either so somebody can just go i mean the schools lock it down so your children
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:30:01.680]  scrabble like gerbils up against a cage wall the windows are all barred they got fences around them
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:05.760]  and they've already had cases where people are like oh let me out and they just walk up and
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:13.120]  dun dun dun dun dun dun you know the terminator i mean this is just absolutely incredible by the way
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:18.800]  i mean it's not you just hide you run and you hide you wait till the person comes around the
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:22.320]  corner and you at least go after them you know they've had a lot of school shooting cases where
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:27.520]  the principal has to run out to their car get the gun out of the car remember that in one case is
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:34.720]  the principal got fired went in and took them out in another case went in and just ran the shooter
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:41.120]  off and he didn't get in trouble i mean thank god the principal went and got their gun and took
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:48.720]  this person out look it's fine for the police to have guns what about us we're the good people
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:57.520]  we need to be protected from the postman and in the in the crazy cops and then the criminals and
[00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:58.640]  everybody going postal
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:06.320]  i mean every office needs an instant access pistol safe a couple of them with trusted employees
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:11.920]  and uh you know somebody ever bust in here i mean folks i mean let me tell you this fast
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:20.320]  and i got a seven shot 357 magnum i go with a revolver because it's simple it's not going
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:23.520]  to jam and when i've got adrenaline going through me it's going to get the job done
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:29.040]  let me take the rounds out of it and again folks i never talk about guns a lot on the
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:33.200]  air i'm just for the second amendment i've got quite a few and i know how to use them
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:38.080]  and you just need to be ready ladies and gentlemen so i'm spinning the cylinder
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:45.600]  you need to be ready ladies and gentlemen and i'm so busy i never get to go to the range of
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:50.080]  three or four times a year everybody needs to do it more than that and uh you need to protect
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:56.080]  yourself i got a 357 magnum smith and wesson i bought this after they quit being gun banners
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:05.840]  and again i know how to use the fanciest of guns but uh for something for quick defense
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:10.480]  this is something i can at 50 yards i can shoot somebody in the chest with this
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:15.840]  at 50 yards i can shoot about a four or five inch pattern with this with this handgun
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:23.200]  uh that's when i'm calm but i but people tell you in the office other places need a shotgun
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:29.920]  but that's something again that's too big too hard to store and uh the point is somebody comes
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:35.440]  around here wanting trouble i'm not going down without a fight okay and i'm not going to live
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:40.320]  in a filth bag state or city where they tell me i can't have this protection i've got in my hand
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:47.520]  right now and but again in those dormitories of your sons and daughters they're not able to have
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:53.600]  an incident access pistol safe they're not able to protect themselves they're they got to sit there
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:58.080]  while some piece of trash mental patient drug addict or government operative or some mind
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:03.280]  control victim and we know that goes on they got to sit there while they have their way with them

[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.320]  a report out asking is this a black op like the others i mean if the government sent black ops
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:55.360]  before and we know they have we got them dead to rights on the beltway sniper we got them dead to
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:40:05.600]  rights on the buford furrow and the jewish school we got them dead to rights on columbine i mean
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:12.800]  it's just john lennon ronald reagan i mean it just goes on and on i mean it's just unbelievable
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:19.520]  mcveigh definite mind control there i mean his his doctor appointed by the government was the
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:24.080]  father of modern mind control jolly and wes who just died a few years ago and was there from the
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:30.800]  time he got arrested the time he was executed the top head mind control doctor 1977 mk ultra
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:41.120]  hearings i mean just unbelievable it's just they they think we're so stupid or the public doesn't
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:44.960]  know there's such a thing as mind control let me tell you the stuff you saw in manchurian candidate
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:53.760]  the new one that came out is exactly exactly how things bounce that's how the ball bounces
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:41:01.760]  and that's exactly what they can do that is so accurate it is chilling but they don't get
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:06.560]  you in facilities and hop you up on drugs for a week and torture you they do it for months or
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:19.920]  years and it works real well oh man unbelievable i mean this didn't happen in the past in america
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:23.600]  and you do have some nuts that go kill people and you got people to go to their work and kill people
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:31.280]  but you got postal stuff most that's real they go shoot their boss and co-workers but this business
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:36.560]  of going around shooting 50 something people killing 30 something of them that's not normal
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:41.600]  and then by normal i mean even in the sick world of mass shootings that's not what you see in the
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:51.600]  criminology now he lives on campus and he's uh matt kazee a listener of this show they're in
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:58.400]  blacksburg virginia it is monday april 16 2007 we're going to be talking about 9 11 and tax
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:03.200]  time and a bunch of war news but we're talking about a mass shooting now the real test is you
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:06.480]  know they already had a bunch of gun bills prepared they just been introducing last week
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:12.880]  and i'll be introducing this next week when they get back in session in the next few weeks excuse
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:16.800]  me now they've been preparing bills having press conferences about bills in the last month to be
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:21.760]  more exact and now you're going to see them all introduced to the endless drum beating
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:27.040]  so that next time there's a mass shooting we'll all be totally disarmed and whoever's got the
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:36.960]  gun can kill 200 300 and uh during breaks i have been watching cnn and fox will flip back and
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:43.600]  forth and it's exactly what i thought it was it's video and photos of cops hours into the shooting
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:48.000]  while shooting still going on standing behind the doors of their patrol cars cowering
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:54.480]  when they knew the basic building they should have immediately had police charge from all
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:43:00.240]  four sides in heavy body armor they should have had swat teams load onto the roof and they got
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:03.600]  swat teams all over the place they all got helicopters but these guys got to sit around
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:07.280]  and plan for hours i mean if you want to do some planning they should they've all got armored
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:11.520]  vehicles they should have rammed an armored vehicle right through the front door and gone
[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:16.480]  right in there and killed this person but no they had to wait hours while he walked around
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:22.880]  shooting everybody four hours and 15 minutes at columbine they sat there i'm tired of it
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:28.560]  i know this if there's ever a mass shooting around here i mean back i mean back and what
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:32.000]  happened at the tower the citizen just pulled the rifles out and kept him pinned down and
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.440]  stopped him from killing he killed most of the people in the first 10 minutes and then folks
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:38.960]  started shooting back and then he only killed about one or two more and wounded a couple
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:42.160]  because people the police and the citizens were shooting at him hundreds of people were
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:49.520]  shooting at him mike hansen's daddy drove the ambulance right up there and was loading police
[00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:53.840]  that had been shot in and citizens in would literally was in the newspaper with flecks
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:58.240]  of concrete cutting him hitting him in the face with bullets from that marine shooting at him
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:03.360]  those who don't know mike he's done work for me for years runs the tv show but
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:09.360]  his uh daddy uh what was his dad's name well everybody knows him around town all the old
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:15.440]  timers it was uh it's it's a german name it's uh i can't believe i can't remember his name
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:17.680]  auto hansen there you go
[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:25.520]  uh it doesn't matter auto liked to drive race cars he had you know they did the drag racing back when
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:30.080]  the cops wouldn't come after you for that and that was back when ambulances drove fast too
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:34.720]  he liked the ambulance drive fast auto hansen that's what made america great was the people
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:41.520]  that were daredevils and liked risk not a bunch of cowards following procedure but i guarantee
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:44.880]  you folks there was some mass shooting i tried to go down there and go in or go help the police
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:49.600]  they gunned me down then say i was a shooter that's how america's changed ladies and gentlemen
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:53.120]  and it's been done by design so the people and the government are at each other's throats i'm
[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:58.560]  going to shut up matt kazee is on the ground he's gone down to the area with the police where near
[00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:03.600]  the shooting where they've got it cordoned off matt you're there in blacksburg virginia at the
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:08.320]  campus tell us what's happening uh yes i'm standing in the middle of about 200 police cars
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:14.880]  i'm right in front of the building where this happened and uh looks you can tell it's all over
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:20.560]  folks um they've got it under control there's still some folks in the swat uniforms a lot of
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:27.760]  sheriffs and a lot of state police and not a kid to be seen a few folks down here videotaping um
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:32.240]  some folks wandering around the drill field but that's about it it is pretty much
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:39.360]  secure that school that school is a giant black cop and i'd say that 50 chance or higher everybody's
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:45.760]  got to get their their children out of there now go ahead um well uh it looks like they still they
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:50.480]  still may be having they may be treating some people over at the local rescue squad which just
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:57.680]  happened to be uh a half a block away um and uh but as far as i can tell they're

[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:35.040]  to mind any other tidbits anything you haven't told us about what's happened there locally
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:39.680]  with the previous shooting a few months ago and the drills and the new speakers they put in
[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:44.240]  right in time for this national spectacle yeah well they definitely did that and this is the
[00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:49.520]  first time that they've used them um and we're coming off of the hills of of at least four bomb
[00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:53.920]  threats in the past week and actually i take that back it's more five or six because there were
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:50:01.760]  multiple bomb threats today in the very area where this was going on and uh it looks like
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:05.200]  there's a bunch of swat coming out of one of the side of the buildings right there and they're
[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:11.920]  they're walking off and everybody you can tell that everybody is much more relaxed now um i'm
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:15.120]  walking back to the house i'm gonna go get my video camera and grab some friends with some
[00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:21.120]  ditch cams and uh now let me ask you a question let me ask you a question sure sure uh one last
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:27.680]  question i'm just look i'm talking to a radio show gcn i'm a reporter for gcn and i'm just
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:32.400]  just covering this i'm walking back to my house which is right there
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:42.640]  yes sir he said i should get to my house and stay in my house um yeah they just want to cover things
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:47.760]  up don't listen to that you live there you're the press you they haven't coordinated anything yet so
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:52.720]  get your cameras and get back over there and get some video all right i will do that and i'll call
[00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:56.240]  you guys back if i get anything okay the last question i had that i've forgotten about with
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:51:03.360]  that cop coming over let me try to bring it back up in memory uh is um the drills well well well
[00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:07.200]  not just we'll talk about the drills that's always important how to use the drills as the cover but
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:11.040]  but that's why these are so dangerous folks we've always told you drills are the cover for this
[00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:15.120]  let's go back now you're having a lot of drills at your school or college folks it means you're a
[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:19.040]  prime target and we've we've told you this many times and again we're not saying it's a black
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:23.840]  op but in my gut it's looking like that and we know we usually call it right 95 percent of the
[00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:30.400]  time i wish i was wrong now go back we this started at 7 15 this morning and it looks like
[00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:36.720]  that they didn't even announce until 11 central noon your time that it had basically been handled
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:45.280]  like 12 15 your time 7 15 to noon is three four five five hours just one of five hours they
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:51.440]  couldn't stop started the loudspeakers around 10 o'clock this morning maybe maybe just after 10
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:59.600]  that's a huge story headline uh school didn't start warning loudspeakers for over three hours
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:06.320]  after shooting eyewitness didn't start the new warnings this thing's a total you're at three
[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:14.000]  hours now i mean be specific was it 10 10 15 10 30 it was either 15 till 10 or 15 after 10 it was
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:18.480]  coming into 10 o'clock because the first thing that i thought of when when it happened was i'm
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:22.640]  going to call into the show and i looked at the clock and i knew it would be a few hours
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:24.240]  and it just got crazy
[00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:31.280]  so so uh dead reckoning well think back we need to be specific about this
[00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:36.480]  think back to when you got up did you look at alarm clocks or what tv show are you watching or
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:44.480]  or or or whose show was on what give us a basic time what time did you hear the the the big brother
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:51.120]  telescreen um approximately around 10 o'clock now it could have been 9 30 or something like that
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:55.040]  um i will definitely be thinking i'm a little bit flustered from all this anyway i'm going to
[00:52:55.040 --> 00:53:01.040]  go over my mind and make sure but i know it was not seven o'clock that's for sure i'm thinking
[00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:06.400]  it was around approximately 10 o'clock i think that they started the alarms when the second
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:13.360]  shooting started so the guy got away from some from them they didn't they may have they detained
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:18.000]  two people two um but i heard that they let one of them go and they're still holding one for
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:24.080]  questioning and i think that they may have thought that they had it this morning or for
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:30.480]  whatever reason they didn't they uh they didn't sound the alarms or maybe not just on my side of
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:34.240]  the campus the first shooting was all well they should have content the media should have been
[00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:38.400]  announcing this i mean if somebody drops a stick of bubble gum on the ground they'll shut down half
[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:45.280]  the schools in virginia or or texas uh you know if if there's a killer on the loose or a convict
[00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:51.040]  on the loose uh now i mean think about this folks at least let's be conservative two hours
[00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:56.880]  after 7 15 i mean that's that's only 9 15 you know let's be conservative for at least two hours
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:54:02.400]  they didn't use their new system they didn't warn the media they kept this thing real quiet
[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:06.880]  i'm telling you this thing stinks like nothing i've ever smelled in the state of denmark or
[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:11.840]  louisiana well now alex i don't know if the media warned it because i was asleep at that time
[00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:16.080]  i'll go home and i'll find out right now from their websites as to what time it got reported
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:22.960]  this morning um i i know the way this is a very small community here this this campus is exploding
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:28.880]  we're just bursting at the seams with too many people in this little small town and uh word

[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:38.400]  and all this confusion i don't know how to even explain it it's like it becomes like an art form
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:46.800]  you just don't know how to look at it and uh it just it reeks of black op and then it's just
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:51.440]  amazing i said i'd go to your calls let's uh go to them and i got the big rosie o'donnell news i
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:57.840]  will spend some time on uh let's go to um richard in canada richard you're on the air thanks for
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:03.120]  holding hey hey alex how you doing this is richard i am so happy to finally get in touch with you
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:07.520]  uh it's been a while and i just want to congratulate you you're a leader brave you're
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:12.800]  courageous i've watched all your documents and actually the funny thing is is that when i was
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:19.280]  waiting on like this breaking news came but what i wanted to tell you was that i actually woke up
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:24.240]  last year because i am an international student here and i was pulled out of a bathroom stall
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:30.720]  by a police officer on campus and i was given no reason why and when i went back in to figure out
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:36.640]  why in the police station they basically told me they were doing their job and um that was it i
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:42.000]  felt like all my rights were taken away and after that like i kind of woke up this is why they love
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.480]  mass shootings because it creates the fear and now they're going to have metal detectors in frisk
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:51.200]  and barbed wire and the schools will be prisons and they're shooting at businesses their prisons
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:56.080]  shooting at the it's everything's a prison now terrorists attack an airport where prisoners
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:00.640]  there uh they attack a bus now we got to have searches i mean it's just total control it is
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:05.280]  and now like the funny thing is is that i think it's already been done because like they knew where
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:10.160]  i was in that same bathroom like the week before like they told me what i was doing and i was like
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:14.320]  how do you know that and they couldn't even man they pulled me out of the stall they didn't even
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:20.480]  tell me who they were they took all my information they took my id i i felt so dehumanized and i
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:24.560]  actually i did get some recourse because instead of going back to the people in authority i went
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:28.960]  to the business department and i told them what happened and they got so worried because i
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:32.720]  threatened to go to the media and because they thought i would just sit down and take it you know
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:36.480]  but that woke me up and that that would that's what well you know why they knew what you were
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:41.600]  doing they've got they've got video cameras in most bathrooms now at colleges and high schools
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:47.200]  and middle schools and a lot of times they got them in the showers and the the principals trade
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:50.640]  them amongst themselves that's been in the news yeah and you're totally right it's so funny to
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:55.760]  know that like everything's so controlled yet so many things happen look if you're in a rest stop
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:03:00.320]  or a university or school and you're on the commode just know they're videotaping and most
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:04.800]  the time definitely and alex you're so right because if they have so much like surveillance
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:08.960]  how do all these things just appear out of the blue and happen and they can't control it i mean
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:13.920]  well notice england has you know 14 million cameras just in the surrounding london area
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:20.000]  four plus million in uh in london and that's like 50 something million nationwide you can go look
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.520]  the numbers up that's a that's a i'm going from memory there but i know it's four and a half
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:28.000]  million in london that was a couple years ago it gets worse now they have telescreens that shout
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.760]  orders at you in a child's voice and their crime actually exploded with that this is so they can
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:39.600]  carry out their terror attacks and know who saw it and know who who could expose them so i just
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:44.320]  want to congratulate you and one day you're going to reach a place that you know all your work is
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:48.640]  going to pay off and you're going to people will wake up to what you're trying to stay and keep up

[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:18.240]  the same principle applies in water filtration most filtration systems force water through the
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:24.720]  filter at 60 to 90 psi causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second the

[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:10.000]  larry pratt the man who leads gunners of america one of the few real second amendment organizations
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:16.880]  in the country is our guest larry pratt we've seen a great tragedy and out of the gates we
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:23.200]  know that virginia tech had a zero gun policy and had invoked and brought in federal and state laws
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:29.360]  even though virginia had a concealed carry where you live and the blood is on their hands that is
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:34.160]  my take on it if this happened anywhere where people were able to have guns this guy would
[01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:38.720]  have been blown away in short order instead this may be one of the biggest mass killings in us
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:47.040]  history alex you're right on the money and one of the sickening ironies of this tragedy is the
[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:56.080]  virginia tech president who opposed legislation in the legislature this year that would have
[01:06:56.080 --> 01:07:04.560]  opened an exception for concealed carry permit holders to have guns on college campuses let's
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:11.040]  explain something to that scumbag criminals and psychopaths are not going to follow the law all
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:18.880]  you do is endanger us and i'm sick of it it's uh it's an amazing mindset that assumes that well
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:24.320]  we've said that it's going to be illegal to have a gun on the campus and so therefore what's your
[01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:33.120]  problem uh it's also illegal to kill 35 people that one doesn't seem to connect to these guys
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:39.440]  and yet the president and i hope these words ring in his ears until the day he dies and preferably
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:45.360]  it'll be a long time that he spends not being the president of the university well the university is
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:53.120]  going to be much safer because today that bill died in committee that he said that that this very piece
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:59.040]  of trash said that that those are his very words he was convinced that he was making the university
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:05.840]  safe he hasn't learned anything from any of our history for this is amazing we've got we've got
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:12.160]  anti-gun activist university that's had two shooting sprees in less than a year on it with cops and
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:18.560]  citizens getting blown away and uh listen larry and i know we've got to seize this as pro second
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:23.360]  amendment pro america listeners across america we got to get out there and put the blame where
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:28.160]  it deserves before they get mobilized to try to get gun control passed how do we do that larry
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:33.680]  one of the things to point out and you're absolutely right we must be on the offensive
[01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:39.680]  we're preparing a media statement that says that the problem at virginia tech was that there weren't
[01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:48.000]  enough guns the thing that we can remind these jaspers of is that approximately two hours down
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:54.400]  the road still in virginia in grundy virginia there's the appalachian school of law which about
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:09:01.520]  four years ago was the scene of something rather similar a student apparently that both students
[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:11.120]  and we think that the shooter today is a student go onto the campus first victim is a professor and
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:16.640]  obviously intentions of killing lots more at the first sounds of the gunshots two of the law
[01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:23.680]  students went to their cars which of course were off the the campus as the law would require because
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:30.560]  they had firearms in them they got their firearms they went to the scene of the crime and subdued
[01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:37.360]  the killer saving perhaps another mass murder of the proportions that we witnessed today but there
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:44.640]  were no none of those students today that were able to do that another school shooting that ended
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:50.080]  rather prematurely from the shooter's point of view was in pearl mississippi where the assistant
[01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:58.000]  principal was able to go similar scenario get his gun stop the shooter no we've got to wait
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:03.200]  like columbine four hours and 15 minutes while the swat teams dress up in darth vader outfits
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:08.320]  and do absolutely nothing well let me just tell everybody something anybody comes in my business
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:12.960]  threatening people with a gun i'm not we don't call the police you're gonna die we'll be right back

[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:57.280]  these people that come in here they've been running our country the last 40 years the
[01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:01.920]  control freaks and you you know your children couldn't play out on the street they could go
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:07.920]  out and play in the on the sidewalk or at the park without fear and because we have degenerated with
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:12.080]  the culture and there are a few more sickos out there their answer is come take our guns
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:18.000]  and i've been around mainline liberals folks and uh i remember one time i was over at my
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.480]  dad's house when i was in college and one of his friends the editor of a major magazine
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:27.120]  i mean an editor of a national magazine i'm not going to say which one he's still there
[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:34.400]  you know friends since i was a little kid was there and my for some reason i was oh yeah i was
[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:38.000]  storing my guns there because i was in you know college and i just didn't have a whole bunch of
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.880]  them when i was still in an apartment but i don't have all my guns in one spot point is
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:45.040]  i came home was getting a rifle and a handgun i was going out to the ranch to go do some shooting
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:54.160]  with friends and uh i'm walking out of my parents bedroom and then out down the stairs through the
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:15:00.640]  living room and i've got one in a gun case and the other is in a little 357 magnum pistol you
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:06.240]  know a little soft case and he goes what is that and i said it's a gun he went oh and he was like
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:10.880]  leaning back on the couch going my god my god but he'll see cops all day with machine guns and he
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:14.960]  feels safe and i went no it's it's it's no big deal they're not loaded oh they always say that
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:19.920]  i went no no no they're not loaded the ammo's out in my car um but it's no big deal if they were i've
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:23.600]  been talking safety since i was a child my dad's like it's all right here look and he got it and
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:32.240]  unzipped it and you'll see it's unloaded look and he's he was like like it was a king cobra
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:37.840]  had come in and was and it opened up its fan and was about to strike dripping venom larry brad how
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:41.200]  do we now of course the government wants to disarm us to enslave us and control us but there
[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:45.760]  really is a mass of people out there that just don't get it larry went into a mindset that is
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:52.560]  very much a problem and is contributing to a growth a worsening uh in our country of the
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:58.320]  perception of guns it's the zero tolerance which it sounds like your editor friend may have been
[01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:06.320]  one of the originators of if you see a gun wet your pants suck suck your thumb and just basically
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:13.120]  be immobile until the big brave man with his bulletproof vest gets there to save you it's
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:20.320]  the most incredible i'm helpless save me from myself kind of way of thinking and it's a very
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:26.800]  dangerous way of thinking as we've just seen so sickeningly today at virginia tech one of the
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:32.960]  early accounts depicted something it was right out of columbine students were reported to have been
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:42.000]  cowering in their classrooms under their desks trying to do whatever they could to remain safe
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:46.320]  well the best thing they could have done to remain safe would have been to pull out a piece
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:52.320]  and go get the bomb but and but because they were victim disarmed they should have gone rampage to
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:58.080]  kick out the wire mesh you know like like animals in a sinking ship clawing to get out they should
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:02.320]  have been up against the edge of the door the minute that person comes in you just savagely
[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:06.720]  attack them i mean i mean if you can escape you might as well fight if you're going to take a
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:11.600]  bullet you might as well charge the piece of dirt because well you might take a bullet
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:16.320]  duh uh and that's you're not going to kneel down while they splatter your brains everywhere
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:19.920]  you're going to probably take one in the gut of the shoulder and live and then others are going
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:24.400]  to pile on and help you and that son of a bitch excuse my french isn't going to be able to kill
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:31.280]  you well that would be what should happen it clearly didn't and the sickening thing the most
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:36.000]  sickening thing that i've heard so far and i'm sure it'll be topped but what was a room full of
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:41.680]  people that this uh piece of dirt had gone into lined them up and they just stood there waiting to
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:49.200]  be shot from this early account i hope that's not true absolute lemming behavior what has happened
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:55.840]  to americans once the most feared upright individualistic aggressive people and they've
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:18:03.120]  turned us into literal jellyfish well i think the the battle really lies there that friend that you
[01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:12.000]  so vividly described having his paroxysms of fear on the sofa in your parents by the way i
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:18.400]  wasn't joking no i'm i'm quite sure that was quite accurate uh he probably decided that it was the
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:27.200]  last time he was going to go to texas they're all nuts down there so that's um that's the the the
[01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:32.080]  world view that really plays into the hands of the disarmament crowd well i mean back when i lived
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:35.840]  in an apartment i'd go deer hunting a couple times a year and i'd you know and i learned to
[01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:41.600]  always even cover the case in a blanket because somebody will see a gun case and go i mean
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:49.520]  literally now i know why hunters uh so typically go early in the morning the sun comes up here i
[01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:53.760]  thought it was because that's the best time to surprise bambi but actually it's because you have
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:19:00.400]  to sneak out to the car so none of the neighbors will see you it's i'm not kidding i mean in a free
[01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:04.880]  country even at my house when i get a rifle out of the gun safe to go to the target range and a
[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:09.360]  lot of times you know they're in there not in cases i'll grab you know my remington 700 and i
[01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:14.640]  go out the back door i look i hit the open on the back of my trunk i lay it in i'm looking both ways
[01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:18.320]  because i mean it's just cowardly jellyfish everywhere you know i had a carpet cleaner at
[01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:23.680]  my house about eight nine years ago and i had a shotgun before i had children on a open rack up on
[01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:28.480]  the wall in my broadcast studio out of my house and uh you know it was just a it was a cheap
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:34.080]  defender pump action you know just for defense and uh the carpet cleaner guy goes is that legal
[01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:38.880]  and he was and i said don't call the police on me and then later i had a bad feeling and i called
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:43.520]  the carpet cleaning place and the owner got on and said no i know who you are alex don't worry
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:48.560]  yeah he did come back he did want to call the police on you we explained that it was legal
[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:53.200]  when they watch cop shows that are set in new york where they always go we found a gun in his house
[01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:57.440]  these people are they believe tv is the real world and we found an arsenal and they'll show
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:04.560]  you a picture of two or three guns and that well that hardly cuts it for an arsenal in my book but
[01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:10.720]  then one gun is an arsenal for these people as we're talking about this the thought has crossed
[01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:18.320]  my mind i am so blessed to have the luxury of an attached garage so that i can sneak my guns out
[01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:26.880]  into the garage into the car without having to draw attention to myself pity the poor guy like
[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:32.160]  you when you were that student in the apartment that had to leave an apartment and walk down who
[01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:37.600]  knows how many flights of stairs and how many hallways so that who knows how many people might
[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:43.280]  see you and and absolutely ruin their day and again they think all guns are illegal and they
[01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:48.000]  and then handgun control incorporated sworn to disarm the american people in the words of sarah
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:53.360]  brady so we can have quote socialism that is enforce it they have they have these billboards
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:59.680]  from galveston texas to kansas city missouri that show a revolver and it says report illegal guns but
[01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:06.720]  then when you read in real small uh print uh it says uh you know those violating gun laws there's
[01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:11.600]  no law against having the revolver but that's to brainwash the public for the perception it's
[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:17.680]  illegal that is the part of the the battle that we're fighting and that's probably a more serious
[01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:24.160]  problem that we're fighting than the laws themselves if anything we've seen modest
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:30.560]  progress at the state level where concealed carry laws have been passed and then expanded where
[01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:35.680]  stand your ground legislation where you don't have to retreat not only in your house but now
[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:41.920]  increasingly out on the street those kinds of laws are very positive also you might consider
[01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:48.560]  that utah and oregon are the only two states that presently have used a little bit of freedom
[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:52.960]  that was allowed by the federal ban on guns at school how do we get back to the point where my
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:58.160]  dad could because as you know his mother would when she was a school teacher she was teaching
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:02.000]  at different schools and when he was at you know they would drive him to one spot where the bus
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.440]  would come pick him up in the country but they'd go into a pretty big you know country school
[01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:11.040]  and they would just uh walk right in larry with their shotguns and their and their and their rounds
[01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:15.280]  their shotgun shells and they'd put them right in their school locker and then a lot of times
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:19.600]  they'd go with the coaches or the principal dove hunting but they just all walked in during during
[01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:24.080]  bird season with their guns into the public school i mean now you're in the country walking down the
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:27.840]  side of the road with a shotgun a cop will pull over and ask what you're doing what happened to
[01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:33.200]  us yours was a kind of an upscale school i've talked to a number of people that didn't have
[01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:38.560]  the lockers they just put them in the cloakroom alongside of or behind the classroom so it was
[01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:43.840]  quite open it wasn't anybody's personal locker at all anybody could have walked in there and gotten
[01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:49.520]  the gun and somehow not only did the gun not go off by itself but none of the kids went in there
[01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:53.920]  and did anything stupid with it now the difference was though when you were being taught gun safety
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:57.680]  if you did anything that wasn't the total gun safety you get the hell beat out of you there
[01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:02.560]  they'd holler your head off for starters oh yeah i knew that uh you were in big trouble if you did
[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:09.680]  anything stupid with with a gun you feared what what the the range master or your dad or whoever
[01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:15.840]  was going to do to you a lot more than whatever might possibly be done with that gun because you
[01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:22.080]  knew that was something going to happen right away if you were careless and so people obviously
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:28.480]  learned it's a pretty good way to learn and we golly we've had members tell us about their trips
[01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:36.080]  to the shooting range at school in new york city taking their their cased rifles onto the subway
[01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:41.600]  in new york city now if you think that the guy in the country is going to have trouble walking with
[01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:47.120]  his gun today imagine trying to go to school well first of all they don't have those shooting ranges
[01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:53.040]  in operation anymore but imagine what would happen they'd probably close off every exit
[01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:58.880]  of one of those subways if somebody were reported to be doing that now notice how they take the
[01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:03.040]  gun ranges away in the schools and suddenly all the shootings start larry let's get down to brass
[01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:07.520]  tax i don't know about this case but there's definitely been some fishy stuff at columbine
[01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:10.880]  and and other places where it looks like government's provocateuring are involved
[01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:15.760]  well there was a massive cover-up of the incompetence of the sheriff's department
[01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:21.440]  in jefferson county which is columbine out in colorado in the denver suburbs
[01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:28.880]  um so in fact it got to be so bad that the sheriff was not reelected and we keep finding
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:33.440]  out things that he was trying to cover up just to make his incompetence looked like it wasn't
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:41.040]  so bad there were plenty of warnings ahead of time that were neglected and then when the officers got
[01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:47.760]  there there was confusion it was kind of risk aversion you know don't don't have a cop put
[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:52.320]  himself in any risk at all so they just waited until everybody was dead and then they went in
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:58.160]  30 40 years ago because i've studied the cases you couldn't stop police from charging in after
[01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:03.440]  a gunman and that was the impulse i think of a lot of the offers officers there but they were told
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:09.040]  stand down and that's what was so terrible about it and i think that was part of the odor that got
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:12.160]  rid of you know they're trying to braid the manhood out of us we'll be right back with
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:17.200]  larry pratt more than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water and did you know
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:20.960]  that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you
[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:25.360]  drink the water that's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are

[01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:49.120]  larry pratt at gunowners.org larry how do we in a nutshell get on the offensive and get the truth
[01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:55.440]  out that it again is victim disarmament inaction uh and that the school needs to be held accountable
[01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:59.520]  instead of turning every university in the country into little prison camps well the one thing that
[01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:06.000]  gun owners of america is set up to do is of course uh provide a voice for grassroots activism we have
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:12.240]  on our website at gunowners.org an email alert system and i can assure you that shortly we're
[01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:20.080]  going to be renewing our campaign to end this senseless dangerous reckless kind of legislation
[01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:24.800]  that's on the books right now that prohibits people from defending themselves it's okay to
[01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:29.840]  defend yourself in most states if you have a concealed carry permit and you're in a 7-11
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:35.040]  but god help you if you're on a school grounds that's nuts to assume that somehow those are the
[01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:40.800]  targets now now now larry uh i've read the different policies and basically if a shooter's
[01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:45.520]  even in the school they lock down that's going to result sometime in a hundred plus dead not
[01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:51.840]  just 32 as they're now reporting uh how do we reverse that insane stance of we lock the children
[01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:58.400]  in like it's fish in a barrel uh the the whole concept as we were talking about earlier is rooted
[01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:04.160]  in if you do nothing you'll be okay if you have no defense that's a good defense uh they're
[01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:09.040]  brainwashing us you just lay there and and take it to go to the fema camps basically uh just to
[01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:14.800]  lie there and take it no matter what is happening whether it's a government abuse or whether it's a
[01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:20.880]  thug like the one at the virginia tech campus thank god at uh appalachian school of law that
[01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:25.600]  there were a couple of students who were willing and able to do something by the way one of the
[01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:30.880]  things that uh we should emphasize is the media doesn't like to report the good things that can
[01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:36.800]  happen such as the appalachian school of law where students with guns actually stopped the
[01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:42.720]  killing uh they they were convinced in the media we know from one associated press editor oh well
[01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:47.600]  if we start telling people about those young men introducing guns into an already dangerous
[01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:52.800]  situation why that would just be reckless to report that and so they didn't report it's a
[01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:56.880]  literal i don't even want to call them effeminate men because women will stand up and fight a lot
[01:31:56.880 --> 01:32:02.640]  of times these aren't even i don't know what to call them these are these are these chicken neck
[01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:08.400]  cowardly little twitch who never lived in the real world who live these little pampered high
[01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:14.240]  rises i guess uh in the big cities and they they want us to all be a bunch of cowards like them
[01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:18.080]  and i'm sorry this is not going to happen well and we know what happens in england after they
[01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:23.040]  ban guns there and they have a murder rate and a violent crime rate that shoots off the charts
[01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:30.000]  the response is oh well we need to uh ban knives and we need to ban replica guns and we and you
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:35.840]  can just see them adding to the list of banned items as if the well the criminals didn't cooperate
[01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:40.480]  in getting rid of the guns in england in fact there's twice the number of illegal guns there
[01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:46.320]  and now as well their crime rates exploded that's the un zone numbers absolutely correct that is
[01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:52.720]  that is the source of that the worst of all 18 industrialized countries in the un study

[01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:28.560]  vibrate is big enough the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters

[01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:28.560]  um it happened at the buildings that were surrounding the building where the shooting was
[01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:36.480]  which i thought that was was before early uh during the week too um
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:42.560]  i'm actually walking to also it's it has cleaned out a lot since the last time i was down here

[01:45:57.040 --> 01:46:02.400]  here you tried to save some people and would you say that the people that disarmed the victims
[01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:09.840]  there are at least accessories to manslaughter the the blood is definitely on their hands
[01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:14.880]  and they really don't seem to care very much they're going to find a way to
[01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:22.800]  to whitewash it and that would not surprise me at all if that happens the uh in the state of
[01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:28.800]  virginia you are authorized you are allowed to get a concealed carry permit so i'm assuming that the
[01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:33.600]  uh the virginia university said well students can't have guns on campus
[01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:39.360]  so what they did is i have a news article right here out of the rowan oak newspaper
[01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:46.160]  virginia tech's ban on guns may draw legal fire some people question whether the university has
[01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:50.960]  the authority to ban the carrying of firearms well there you go so the blood is on the hands
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:57.200]  of everybody in the administration of that university and i hope they get sued into oblivion
[01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:04.000]  i hope their lives are destroyed for allowing someone to come in there and murder american
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:11.680]  students i have no sympathy for anybody who works at a university administration level who thinks
[01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:16.720]  that they're an elitist or who believes they are who who doesn't think that the little peons the
[01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:22.560]  students have a right to defend their life these people should be put against a wall and executed
[01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:30.320]  well that's what they certainly did uh by fiat to these students absolutely and i think that this
[01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:35.280]  is a i think that there's some other strange things about this as you know the parker decision
[01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:41.120]  in washington dc had to do with people being able to have a gun in their home to defend their life
[01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:46.960]  notice how this is now you notice how this but i think we're in the same wavelength but you see
[01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:54.240]  uh the uh there's also been calls in congress for more gun control schemes hr 1022 oddly enough
[01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:58.640]  is the name of the bill the number of the bill so all of a sudden you have people pushing gun
[01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:04.320]  control you have people reacting to something favorable about gun ownership then you have this
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:10.320]  tragedy it really smells to me remember columbine they were having the nra convention a month later
[01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:15.120]  they just had the big gun control convention in new orleans we were winning the fight and then
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:20.240]  that thing i mean that was clearly had some type of black op involved when you look at columbine
[01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:26.480]  they brought 120 plus bombs some of them weighing over 100 pounds into the building the police were
[01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:31.360]  all at lunch half the school wasn't there that day the son of an fbi agent founds the group
[01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:34.720]  harris and kleibold make a school movie about how they're going to kill everybody they run the
[01:48:34.720 --> 01:48:40.960]  school's internet the SWAT team waits four hours and 15 minutes to go in well i think that's my
[01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:47.040]  party if you think about it there was a situation similar to this in canada not too long ago and a
[01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:52.720]  couple years ago in australia which started a big push for gun control in australia tasmania
[01:48:52.720 --> 01:49:00.240]  and so i uh i this thing just smells to me i'm urging every gun owner to just dig their heels
[01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:05.280]  in and say hell no hey listen we gotta get on the offensive i agree we gotta get on the offensive
[01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:11.040]  everyone call every talk show today and and let's get the united front out headline everybody write
[01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:18.320]  your own emails your own blogs your own my spaces the people that had this be a zero gun uh school
[01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:23.680]  even after they'd had another big public shooting a few months ago there and they just put in
[01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:28.000]  loudspeakers and all this weird stuff and they had drills at the very building that got attacked
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:33.600]  earlier this week i mean aaron this thing stinks to high heaven like a bees line deal you know we
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:38.560]  know now putin pulled that off i think that uh every one of your listeners has to make a
[01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:44.320]  commitment to themselves any politician who supports gun control schemes must have their
[01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:51.520]  career aborted no ifs ands or buts about it uh aaron gelman continue with your analysis on
[01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:56.880]  what's happened here well i think again as we've been talking about from what little i know based
[01:49:56.880 --> 01:50:03.040]  on some of the information on the internet that you have a situation where apparently an asian
[01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:08.560]  student that they claim he's agent went in there looking for his girlfriend uh had some kind of
[01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:13.600]  personal issue going on uh according to the article i've already lined students up and
[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:21.120]  systematically murdered them one at a time uh so we have a situation here where again students were
[01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:29.280]  left defenseless because of the dictates of the people who run the school and uh if justice is
[01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:34.960]  ever going to be done the president of this university has to go to prison would you put
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:39.040]  less than that would you put your son or daughter and not this isn't just a question for aaron but
[01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:44.240]  i wanted to answer it in a place where you know it's a target of nutballs or government ops or
[01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:50.480]  anything else where you knew they couldn't defend themselves no i would not uh there is a problem
[01:50:50.480 --> 01:50:55.760]  here though there's a lot of university campuses don't allow students to carry weapons no i know
[01:50:56.400 --> 01:51:01.760]  and so you know we're putting a rock in a hard place if you want your kid to go to college
[01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:07.520]  what do you do you can't home school them at that point so this is a situation where
[01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:12.000]  everybody listening has got to decide that if they if they're if they have kids in school
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:15.760]  can't defend themselves it's time to do something about the administration of that school
[01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:23.280]  absolutely everything for these people to retire on a fat pension they have to go bottom line here
[01:51:25.520 --> 01:51:29.840]  you smell a giant stinking rat you think this is suspicious with it because it's always perfect
[01:51:29.840 --> 01:51:33.760]  even rush limbaugh said years ago i heard him you know it's always perfect timing right when they
[01:51:33.760 --> 01:51:39.120]  get ready for a new gun bush there'll be a string there'll probably be a bunch of copycats now oh i
[01:51:39.120 --> 01:51:43.440]  have no doubt about it you know i think this thing really stinks i think that i think the parker
[01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:48.640]  decision really got them going because if you listen to what the uh the gun haters have been
[01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:54.640]  saying that they're in they're in shock uh that uh somehow the government's going to recognize
[01:51:55.120 --> 01:52:00.000]  that the gun ownership is an individual right not a color and we real conservatives i don't
[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:03.360]  mean the fake george bush conservative listeners but real conservative issues
[01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:10.800]  of second amendment uh border control uh anti-abortion pro-life we're in polls gaining uh
[01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:16.320]  feet every day and and and now that doesn't mean the government's moving but they see us moving
[01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:21.520]  and yeah they're panicking aaron absolutely i think you're going to see more situations like this
[01:52:22.320 --> 01:52:28.480]  and so i'm telling people dig your heels in get prepared things are going to get dicey yeah we'll
[01:52:28.480 --> 01:52:33.760]  probably and they're all i remember alex a couple years ago i told you you laughed at me but i said
[01:52:33.760 --> 01:52:40.240]  don't be surprised that there are not elections presidential elections uh let's just see what
[01:52:40.240 --> 01:52:45.040]  happens just just put it put on the back burner and let it simmer no i wasn't like that might
[01:52:45.040 --> 01:52:48.960]  have been another host all right okay aaron you might have i mean i know you were are you kidding
[01:52:48.960 --> 01:52:53.200]  i write articles about how ron paul said on the show last week ron paul said they're gearing up
[01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:59.760]  for martial law right now of course so i wouldn't plan on elections i think all this is just bread
[01:52:59.760 --> 01:53:05.840]  and circuses well you think it's just going to crescendo and build well if they can make it
[01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:11.120]  happen that's why the i think your listeners have got to get ready they've got to have their wits
[01:53:11.120 --> 01:53:15.760]  about them well everybody feels it i mean we all the old timers talked about the new world order
[01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:20.960]  building up but now we see all the things they talked about happening brother well i i think
[01:53:20.960 --> 01:53:26.800]  it's more than just the new world order i think it's really a uh a matter of people have just
[01:53:26.800 --> 01:53:31.600]  become too comfortable too comfortable with the government i was reading an article this morning
[01:53:32.160 --> 01:53:37.360]  52 percent of the people in the united states have money coming from the government federal
[01:53:37.360 --> 01:53:43.520]  government one way or another 52 of the american people yeah i don't have a red
[01:53:43.600 --> 01:53:47.920]  scent coming from them so well they're also including people on social security you know
[01:53:47.920 --> 01:53:55.520]  things of that nature but uh 50 or or dependence so 52 percent of the american people i've got a
[01:53:55.520 --> 01:54:00.240]  warm fuzzy feeling about the government and another 10 percent are in the criminal justice system
[01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:06.880]  so they've got us one way or another aaron zellman give us the website uh jpfo.org and
[01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:11.920]  you'll learn more about our efforts to destroy the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms
[01:54:11.920 --> 01:54:15.600]  and that's going to be important with this new push for gun control well listen i want to get
[01:54:15.600 --> 01:54:19.280]  you up for a full hour in the next few days so let my producer call you as we can really walk
[01:54:19.280 --> 01:54:23.680]  through this so we can take some calls as well aaron zellman thank you for spending time with us
[01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:28.000]  my pleasure alex be well you bet take care well there's aaron zellman thinking it's probably an
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:31.760]  inside job and larry pratt said there's some things that are suspicious as well
[01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:39.680]  and drills and all these things i mean this thing uh i think you're going to find out this guy was
[01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:45.360]  under psychiatric care uh you're going to find out and god if he is a muslim folks that's the kickoff
[01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:50.800]  and there's a slight chance it could just be a nut or a real muslim terrorist or you know you
[01:54:50.800 --> 01:54:54.480]  never there are real things that happen that aren't the government they're few and far between
[01:54:55.280 --> 01:55:00.160]  and i've said real terrorist attacks do look like this where somebody goes in and stabs 15
[01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:06.640]  people or shoots 45 people uh and i've told you that that of the four types of terrorism
[01:55:06.720 --> 01:55:11.040]  there's really three there's one subset there's one form that's real organic and then this could
[01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:16.160]  be that but it sounds like a guy throwing a fit with his girlfriend but in all the other cases
[01:55:16.160 --> 01:55:21.040]  they're on they're on drugs they're in psychiatric care their parents are feds they've been at weird
[01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:28.160]  bases or they were military troops and weird mind control programs remember the guy larry ashbrook
[01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:38.640]  i'm going from memory on that uh in 1998 there's a 99 in fort worth and it was 98 went in and he
[01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:43.120]  shot a bunch of people and he'd been calling the police department he'd been in the navy he'd been
[01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:48.320]  in secret operations he got out and he would like write the editor and go look i'm under mind control
[01:55:48.320 --> 01:55:53.200]  i'm not schizophrenic and the neighbors saw guys dragging him and put him in a van i mean it wasn't
[01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:58.320]  just that he was a lot of schizophrenics out there he really was under their control he went
[01:55:58.320 --> 01:56:04.000]  to baptist church and lined them up and they just groveled and he and he said do you you
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:09.840]  know do you believe in jesus yes boom same thing with the columbine deal the mind control involves
