[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:32.400]  on Friday President Obama came out and said quote people feel like the world is in crisis because
[00:32.400 --> 00:42.320]  of the media very simplistic statement partially true the public is scared to swim because they
[00:42.320 --> 00:48.440]  think great white sharks are eating hundreds of people a day not five a year people are afraid
[00:48.440 --> 00:52.960]  of jihadis that are being protected by the government and allowed to attack the United
[00:52.960 --> 01:00.320]  States but statistically still one of the rarest forms of death but the mainstream media doesn't
[01:00.320 --> 01:05.480]  hide people up to scare them say about glyphosates in the water causing on record the massive
[01:05.480 --> 01:15.880]  increase in breast cancer that literally kills hundreds of thousands of people a year in the
[01:15.880 --> 01:23.240]  western world alone what the mainstream media is not doing is actually letting people know
[01:23.240 --> 01:30.080]  how globally the world is lining up for the type of events we saw in world war one and
[01:30.080 --> 01:42.680]  world war two but magnified because of the changing technological landscape I've been
[01:42.680 --> 01:47.080]  talking about this a lot the last few years this big quickening that was coming this geo
[01:47.080 --> 01:53.040]  political crisis we'll have increased warfare increased terrorism increased asymmetrical
[01:53.040 --> 02:00.840]  warfare increased financial instability increased racial and religious tensions increasing financial
[02:00.840 --> 02:10.720]  crises environmental crises because the political class has made the decision to exacerbate
[02:10.720 --> 02:16.480]  those problems and then poses saviors to supposedly cure those problems to only gain
[02:16.480 --> 02:21.160]  more power and there's been a mix of that throughout history there's been different
[02:21.160 --> 02:26.440]  types of elites some incredibly wicked and evil some altruistic as everyone knows but
[02:26.440 --> 02:35.520]  this time there's a perfect storm of delusion and decadence and and and and arrogance not
[02:35.520 --> 02:42.080]  just by the elites but by the general population of the planet as well that is creating a witch's
[02:42.080 --> 02:51.680]  brew perfect storm cascade and I say I've been talking about this for a couple of years
[02:51.680 --> 02:57.680]  I've been talking about it for 20 years on air just about 20 years in about a month it
[02:57.680 --> 03:04.040]  would be 20 years I've been on air but I've been talking about it intensely for 18 but
[03:04.040 --> 03:09.000]  even more intensely the last two and suddenly you see the British Ministry of Defense and
[03:09.000 --> 03:15.680]  the Pentagon and all these other major systems saying prepare for it as well that it's an
[03:15.680 --> 03:23.560]  inevitability not just a possibility and by and large the Pentagon Ministry of Defense
[03:23.560 --> 03:32.960]  and police departments and others are not guilty really of anything when it comes to
[03:32.960 --> 03:42.800]  creating the crises they are then tasked with cleaning up the crisis which again is another
[03:42.800 --> 03:46.680]  power grab for the establishment but it's kind of like a billy club going upside your
[03:46.680 --> 03:53.000]  head or a baseball bat for no reason it may not be guilty itself but it doesn't matter
[03:53.000 --> 04:00.400]  it's still the instrument of the destruction and our biggest problem we face as a species
[04:00.400 --> 04:08.400]  is the complexity of the world and the fact that the establishment has created such centralized
[04:08.400 --> 04:20.200]  compartmentalization you add that to a decadence cycle that is obviously intensifying we're
[04:20.200 --> 04:26.600]  in the very bottom of a decadence cycle that if it cascades into a deeper cycle of decadence
[04:26.600 --> 04:35.720]  it will just be beyond Rome before it's collapsed we're already getting there but we could bottom
[04:35.720 --> 04:43.680]  out have a soft landing in my view and get out of this and really have a new era of prosperity
[04:43.680 --> 04:50.240]  and freedom and learn from our mistakes and get a Nineveh type reprieve but it's going
[04:50.240 --> 04:55.280]  to take some Jonas out there who are willing to go out and get the public to be aware of

[08:53.200 --> 09:01.520]  a quote going to get worse in the very near future us prepares for obola outbreak cases
[09:01.520 --> 09:11.560]  may exceed 100,000 by december the numbers are really scary the deadly contagion continues
[09:11.560 --> 09:17.960]  to spread and i'm going to say it again they had major scientific reports out two years
[09:17.960 --> 09:25.880]  ago in major scientific publications confirming african studies carried out by the west where
[09:25.880 --> 09:40.680]  obola is airborne it is airborne in sneeze droplets or spit droplets sinus droplets and
[09:40.680 --> 09:47.920]  it has been transferred between pigs and monkeys through the air and it's believed from the
[09:47.920 --> 09:55.360]  beginning it comes from bats flying around basically crapping in the air excuse my french
[09:55.360 --> 10:00.520]  and that people and animals are breathing it but you've got to have it go directly in
[10:00.520 --> 10:04.440]  there's a spectrum of airborne you've got stuff that can live in the air for a long time like
[10:04.440 --> 10:11.720]  fungus and things can live weeks if not months sometimes longer that they believe the curse
[10:11.720 --> 10:16.000]  of the pharaohs where so many explorers go in and discover the tomb and then two weeks
[10:16.000 --> 10:20.920]  later dead from respiratory problems or you can have multi thousand year old deadly fungus
[10:20.920 --> 10:28.680]  in there that our current population is not prepared for and has never experienced so
[10:28.680 --> 10:41.800]  it's lethal now that's airborne when you've got 3000 year old fungus killing people obola
[10:41.800 --> 10:55.440]  only survives a matter of seconds unless it's in microscopic nasal fluid or lung fluid being
[10:55.440 --> 11:01.440]  coughed up into the air but I've seen very little mainstream media coverage of this I
[11:01.440 --> 11:04.640]  know Paul Watson wrote about it a few weeks ago we probably need to write about it again
[11:04.640 --> 11:10.640]  and just say why won't the media point out that obola is beginning to go airborne and
[11:10.640 --> 11:16.920]  it appears to be mutating and becoming stronger they said that it now gestates or goes through
[11:16.920 --> 11:23.560]  its incubation period over a much longer period of time allowing it to spread much more readily
[11:23.560 --> 11:34.000]  before the symptoms show up it's a very big deal though news on obola virus has been muted
[11:34.000 --> 11:37.920]  since two American healthcare workers were admitted to US based facilities last month
[11:37.920 --> 11:42.360]  the deadly continues to spread according to the world health organization with more than
[11:42.360 --> 11:47.600]  40% of all obola cases thus far have occurred in just the last three months you understand
[11:47.600 --> 11:56.160]  that that's of all time suggesting the virus is continuing to build steam physicists at
[11:56.160 --> 12:01.240]  Northwestern University in Boston and other researchers are trying to figure out how far
[12:01.240 --> 12:06.360]  obola may spread and how many people around the world can be affected based on its findings
[12:06.360 --> 12:11.800]  there will be 10,000 cases by September of this year and it only gets worse from there
[12:11.800 --> 12:20.560]  we're going to be talking about that some today but don't worry Bill and Melinda Gates
[12:20.560 --> 12:24.840]  have been working on a vaccine for it and let me tell you obola goes really airborne
[12:24.840 --> 12:29.400]  and starts killing a bunch of people I would want to take a vaccine even if it was risky
[12:29.400 --> 12:35.160]  to try to protect myself the problem is you can't go to certified evil government and
[12:35.160 --> 12:40.120]  certified evil organizations that have been caught not once not twice but thousands
[12:40.120 --> 12:48.160]  of times jacking with vaccines and other medicines then they always go you people are anti science
[12:48.160 --> 12:54.880]  why you can get a you know artificial immunity from vaccines no we know that we're not Fred
[12:54.880 --> 13:03.760]  Flintstone in fact you're playing on the ignorant public out there we read the inserts on the
[13:03.760 --> 13:09.880]  polio vaccine on the hepatitis vaccine on the Gardasil vaccine we know all of them kill
[13:09.880 --> 13:15.440]  a percentage of people that take it all sorts of autoimmune disorders we know the anthrac
[13:15.440 --> 13:19.280]  shots they gave the troops in three different rounds killed hundreds of them second tens
[13:19.280 --> 13:28.160]  of thousands it's all on record that a they don't care what's in the vaccines and b they're
[13:28.160 --> 13:36.120]  putting things in this is a government I'm gonna say it again that for 47 48 years gave
[13:36.120 --> 13:48.360]  black people vaccines that were really syphilis and first one Tuskegee broke they're like
[13:48.360 --> 13:52.720]  oh we let black people have it and then let them spread it didn't treat them that was
[13:52.720 --> 13:56.080]  like oh we actually let some of them you know actually contract that we would give it to
[13:56.080 --> 13:59.720]  them and then oh actually it started with we had a controlled sample so we would give
[13:59.720 --> 14:07.720]  it to the blacks and the local clinics it's just unbelievable folks and the reason that
[14:07.720 --> 14:14.760]  the the the scientific technocrats did that to black people poor Appalachian whites and
[14:14.760 --> 14:21.320]  Native Americans was because they were poor and nobody would listen to them the globalist
[14:21.320 --> 14:25.840]  the eugenicist would have done it to everybody if they thought they could get away with it
[14:25.840 --> 14:32.480]  and now they do in fact it's mainly upper middle class people that run out and get their daughters
[14:32.480 --> 14:41.120]  the multi thousand dollar it's over $1500 last time I checked three three round Gardasil
[14:41.120 --> 14:47.520]  shot and all these soccer moms drive up in their Mercedes they take their daughter in
[14:47.520 --> 14:52.000]  and they get the first round and then the girls in bed for a week with a headache and
[14:52.000 --> 14:56.600]  blood on the brain and you know loses 1015 IQ points but mama takes them back in and
[14:56.600 --> 15:04.520]  slams them again and then usually by the second round they have such bad epileptic seizures
[15:04.520 --> 15:09.480]  that a lot of moms get smart don't get in the third round and it's a good lead percentage
[15:09.480 --> 15:14.000]  it's a small percentage but it's a good percentage that end up dying or have an autoimmune disorders
[15:14.000 --> 15:21.720]  and epilepsy narcolepsy I know people who went and got the Gardasil women who now can't
[15:21.720 --> 15:26.560]  drive because they have narcolepsy and then one of the women I know I know two women that
[15:26.560 --> 15:33.040]  have told me about this they're known for years another one now is developing epilepsy
[15:33.040 --> 15:41.480]  at like I think 34 years old no epilepsy in her family it's not genetic I know to talk
[15:41.480 --> 15:51.160]  show host in Austin that took the H1N1 vaccine five years ago and both of them got their
[15:51.160 --> 16:06.920]  hands and feet totally numb one of them the feeling hasn't come back five years later
[16:06.920 --> 16:12.960]  and they went to their doctor and the doctor said oh yeah you've got Guillain beret from
[16:12.960 --> 16:17.800]  the vaccine and this talk show host I've been on the show many times I'm not going to even
[16:17.800 --> 16:28.280]  say their name I told them not to take it and it still happened I gotta try to get that
[16:28.280 --> 16:32.040]  talk show host on just to bet him about it because a lot of those people want something
[16:32.040 --> 16:41.480]  bad happens to them they double down again believing in the system and within this whole
[16:41.480 --> 16:48.840]  vaccine debate is just a case point example for everything else because we know fluoride
[16:48.840 --> 16:56.040]  causes massive IQ reduction sevenfold increase in bone cancer in men and boys increase pancreatic
[16:56.040 --> 17:02.400]  cancer increase bladder cancer bone cancer I already mentioned that just just literally
[17:02.400 --> 17:07.480]  hundreds of things just absolutely it's the worst thing you could take that doesn't kill
[17:07.480 --> 17:15.600]  you pretty much immediately and there's hundreds of other chemicals that they add under the
[17:15.600 --> 17:26.080]  name of fluoride and it's a fact it's an absolute total incontrovertible fact and I know all
[17:26.080 --> 17:35.840]  sorts of democratic party elites here in Austin through a family connection and they will
[17:35.840 --> 17:42.080]  literally laugh at you and pour tap water and say I love my tap water they've done studies
[17:42.080 --> 17:47.200]  it tastes better than bottled which all those studies are completely fake it's come out
[17:47.200 --> 17:51.840]  I mean we've gone out with real filtered water versus tap water almost every person wants
[17:51.840 --> 18:02.960]  the filtered water and says it tastes better but it's it's it's a religious sacrament it's
[18:02.960 --> 18:11.520]  a religious belief in the state and that's what Obama and Joe Biden and John Kerry we
[18:11.520 --> 18:16.440]  got to get these clips together and put them all together and they say believe keep the
[18:16.440 --> 18:21.960]  faith stay with us stay with government it's it's not some bad tyranny around the corner
[18:21.960 --> 18:32.920]  believe in it it's going to deliver keep the faith is a Catholic saying they are now reduced
[18:32.920 --> 18:42.320]  to literally saying keep the faith government is the religion and for people that believe
[18:42.320 --> 18:46.640]  in the system and have worked in it so far it has delivered but it's also delivered an
[18:46.640 --> 18:52.280]  empty soulless culture of dependent people both in the governing and corporate but also
[18:52.280 --> 18:57.320]  welfare class it's created a system based on fraud and graft and connections and insider

[24:22.720 --> 24:28.480]  on so many fronts that are being turned towards control turned towards social manipulation
[24:32.400 --> 24:37.840]  and according to DARPA who invented the internet and set up the modern infrastructure we live under
[24:37.840 --> 24:45.120]  within just a few years devices are coming out where they won't store data natively
[24:46.720 --> 24:50.560]  or very little you'll be forced onto a cloud like system
[24:52.880 --> 25:02.640]  cloud computing headed up by amazon google and apple oracle sysco and others
[25:02.640 --> 25:11.440]  openly admits that they're co-housing their servers with the nsa and the cia
[25:13.840 --> 25:20.240]  and that microsoft has basically been part of the intelligence combine since its founding along
[25:20.240 --> 25:30.080]  with ibm so when i talk about hundreds of stars having their photos grabbed by a hacker who was
[25:30.080 --> 25:39.360]  able to break into the apple cloud it's a fact that these systems make us insecure not secure
[25:40.240 --> 25:49.200]  all you had to do was get into the cloud search by their names find their accounts and download it
[25:53.840 --> 25:59.280]  and i have nothing to hide on my cell phone it's like photos of my children and and sunsets and
[25:59.280 --> 26:03.600]  things like that but if you don't turn off the function it geo locates every photo
[26:04.960 --> 26:09.040]  it tells people where you're at when you take a photo of you tweet it if you don't go remove
[26:09.040 --> 26:14.640]  that function imagine what that does for thieves and criminals and governments see and it was all
[26:14.640 --> 26:24.000]  built just like if you go back more than 15 16 years ago mit darpa the department of transportation
[26:24.000 --> 26:29.120]  and the same thing in europe and in asia all standardized would have these big meetings in
[26:29.120 --> 26:36.240]  london and chicago and shidney and tokyo you could go read the minutes of the public meetings
[26:37.040 --> 26:42.800]  about how there'll be surveillance robots on every street corner and drones and armored vehicles and
[26:42.800 --> 26:48.000]  everything you do will be up on a big cloud and they'll be able to control your speech in real time
[26:48.000 --> 26:57.600]  real time and uh how all the cars would have a standardized gps tracking to tax you and track
[26:57.600 --> 27:03.440]  you by the mile and then i watched them phase it in put the boxes in the last five years globally
[27:03.440 --> 27:10.560]  and now they're passing regulations to make it the law to tax you by the mile just it's
[27:10.560 --> 27:17.440]  all happening and i'm gonna say it again all premeditated all decided by global governance
[27:17.440 --> 27:23.600]  corporate boards that are unelected just like the trans-pacific partnerships the north american
[27:23.600 --> 27:28.960]  partnerships the EU partnerships all start as trade deals and then pretty soon they're running
[27:28.960 --> 27:34.800]  the countries and the countries have no power and then what does the EU and global governance model
[27:34.800 --> 27:40.880]  do learn as control of you paul watson did a video report on this yesterday that is very powerful
[27:40.880 --> 27:47.280]  that i want to get and play in the next segment EU to ban toasters and vacuum cleaners because
[27:47.280 --> 27:54.000]  of quote global warming and put a tax on all the others you buy at the store now why would they do
[27:54.000 --> 28:02.000]  that because it's about control if they can tell you that you can't have a vacuum cleaner i mean
[28:02.000 --> 28:05.920]  they're cutting them down where the vacuum cleaner won't even clean they can push you back to the stone
[28:05.920 --> 28:13.920]  age and then government districts get a load of this they get waivers on it it's about controlling
[28:13.920 --> 28:19.520]  technology at its source it's about setting precedence that we tell you how big your toilet is
[28:19.520 --> 28:25.200]  what type of lightbulbs you get how big your yard can be how many kids you can have where how many
[28:25.200 --> 28:31.520]  times you can go on vacation how much beef you can have this is all their planned opolis model
[28:31.520 --> 28:39.040]  on record from their own words where from cradle to grave social workers will run our lives
[28:39.040 --> 28:43.520]  and it's here
[28:47.280 --> 28:53.120]  and it's premeditated and i get up here on air and say don't let the department transportation
[28:53.120 --> 28:57.920]  or obama with an executive order start the forced taxation of cars by the mile
[28:57.920 --> 29:07.520]  and people just say that doesn't exist it'll never happen it will never get obama care either
[29:09.440 --> 29:14.000]  we'll never ever see obama just legalize all the illegals by fiat already done it
[29:16.800 --> 29:23.280]  we have to wake up that we have bad people who have bad plans for us and our families in charge

[33:57.360 --> 34:06.080]  deep down that the social engineers that are running our globe the technocrats
[34:08.240 --> 34:15.200]  have it out for us on record and have built the civilization that we're living in they've
[34:15.200 --> 34:21.280]  basically hijacked what our forebears built what we built and they've built into it

[36:21.840 --> 36:32.480]  and now a british company is invading the us with crowd sourcing political campaigns
[36:32.480 --> 36:37.520]  where they claim it's all grassroots but they'll push with the media the ones they want to promote
[36:37.520 --> 36:44.400]  to even give more money and obama has come out and said yes democrats average democrat give us money
[36:45.760 --> 36:49.760]  and then and then you will outdo the special interests no they'll just take your money as
[36:49.760 --> 36:56.880]  well joe biden has come out and said we're gonna play the clip coming up let's take america back
[36:56.880 --> 37:01.040]  you know when republicans or libertarians say that they claim it's code for racist
[37:03.040 --> 37:06.240]  of course if you say death panels are horrible and point out where they are in the bill
[37:06.960 --> 37:14.240]  they go that's racist too but see that's 1984 when they use that term it's okay take america back
[37:14.240 --> 37:20.560]  the democratic party has run this country since its inception the democratic party
[37:21.360 --> 37:28.000]  basically founded the kook lux clan the democratic party runs this nation the republican just
[37:28.000 --> 37:33.840]  plays second fiddle as a placeholder and fake opposition i mean you are the president you've
[37:33.840 --> 37:39.120]  had the senate and for a while the house you've got the governors ever you've got everything
[37:39.120 --> 37:45.520]  so you do run things with the dollar devaluation and the corporate welfare
[37:45.520 --> 37:50.000]  and the society breaking down and the idea with their lean forward that's a leninist
[37:52.800 --> 37:56.400]  carl marxie and even predates lenin but that's a lenin slogan lean forward
[37:57.360 --> 38:01.760]  this is how dumb they think you are your children belong to the state you didn't build your business
[38:01.760 --> 38:11.040]  lean forward it's just for anyone who's studied history this is so over the top ladies and gentlemen
[38:15.840 --> 38:21.680]  it's twilight zone and the scientific dictators openly write in their own books they do this
[38:21.680 --> 38:27.520]  because it works we follow the same patterns over and over again so i'm just basically here watching
[38:27.520 --> 38:36.000]  us go over the edge of a cliff watching the preparations for civil war watching the preparations
[38:36.000 --> 38:43.120]  to let al qaeda now rebranded ish attack the united states and europe and then they'll just
[38:43.120 --> 38:50.160]  build up the paramilitary forces and the police and then point them at gun owners libertarians
[38:50.160 --> 38:55.440]  conservatives the tea party and i and i told you that 12 13 years ago i told you that six years
[38:55.440 --> 39:00.720]  ago i told you that a month ago you now notice it's all happening because i've learned their
[39:00.720 --> 39:04.240]  algorithm i've learned how the globalist operate
[39:08.400 --> 39:14.720]  one year ago over 75 percent of americans we have the polls today steve watch an article
[39:14.720 --> 39:20.000]  about it info wars dot com we're almost 80 percent of americans depending on the polls
[39:20.000 --> 39:24.880]  somewhere higher but i say 75 76 that was the average poll was a bunch of them was against
[39:24.880 --> 39:31.280]  aiding al qaeda in overthrow in syria because the narrative got out through this show and through
[39:31.280 --> 39:35.360]  others and then senator paul senator cruz and others that we don't want to be al qaeda's air
[39:35.360 --> 39:42.960]  force the military rebelled and that was a magic moment i just got chills i really did a magic moment
[39:44.480 --> 39:47.520]  where when they finally called that off and general dempsey went and said there's going to be a
[39:47.520 --> 39:53.520]  military rebellion we will not back al qaeda i cried dry and i rarely cry folks i literally
[39:53.520 --> 39:58.400]  didn't boo who like somebody died it was tears of joy i was smiling in the car leaning on the
[39:58.400 --> 40:04.800]  steering wheel driving and traffic racked with the joy that we could be a moral nation again
[40:04.800 --> 40:09.120]  we could turn the tide will never be perfect but try to be good try to be honest try to be on the
[40:09.120 --> 40:15.600]  right side of history and it was such a death star destruction level event i cried bigger than
[40:15.600 --> 40:20.880]  when we got the secret u n documents that it's really all about carbon taxes and eugenics and
[40:20.880 --> 40:25.200]  destroying the third world when we got that secret document that was confirmed to be authentic
[40:25.200 --> 40:29.920]  and we basically broke it here on the air with lord mongton i didn't cry i actually had the
[40:29.920 --> 40:35.280]  guys go get champagne we had champagne on air and you watch that crippled their whole carbon
[40:35.280 --> 40:41.120]  tax operation that that's still alive but barely it was like the death star blowing up i mean
[40:41.920 --> 40:46.720]  i know you're excited when your team wins the finals or semi finals or wins the rose bowl or
[40:46.720 --> 40:54.560]  or what i understand but when we're toe-to-toe against eugenics sworn to destroy us and we
[40:54.560 --> 41:00.080]  have major devastating victories against them i want to celebrate them the enemy is not going
[41:00.080 --> 41:05.040]  to celebrate these victories for us it is a celebration that we reach 20 million people a
[41:05.040 --> 41:11.120]  week on all the different platforms we have it's a celebration that we dominate boxy and roku and
[41:11.120 --> 41:17.120]  itunes and hundreds of other platforms uh that we're on where people can vote with you know just
[41:17.120 --> 41:23.040]  clicking a true vote in the market of ideas i'm not bragging about us i'm giving you the good news
[41:23.040 --> 41:28.880]  it is a true victory that's so-called alternative news sites that were called tabloid and all this
[41:28.880 --> 41:35.760]  other bull by dinosaur state-run media are now the dominant media in their constellation and by
[41:35.760 --> 41:41.840]  that together in our groups promoting liberty promoting real news real ideas doesn't mean we
[41:41.840 --> 41:47.760]  even all agree with each other an info wars dot com and world net daily a drugs report dot com
[41:47.760 --> 41:54.160]  ablaze whatever even though none of us are perfect or have all the answers together the the marketplace
[41:54.160 --> 42:01.040]  of ideas the listeners the commenters the people the guest is creating a a alternative to the
[42:01.040 --> 42:07.840]  establishment that that is closer to reality by light years than what the establishment's putting
[42:07.840 --> 42:15.840]  out who's trying to deceive i was on the elliptical for a 45 minutes this morning and i was watching
[42:15.840 --> 42:22.720]  msnbc monitoring state-run media literally and it is a chore it was work with the audio off just
[42:22.720 --> 42:28.240]  just reading the text because if i look at the fake narcissistic confidence faces they're making
[42:28.240 --> 42:32.800]  that they get coached on this with dumbed-down masses just looking confidence all that matters
[42:32.800 --> 42:39.440]  with their with their victims that you know that watch them so i i i read the text i don't
[42:40.160 --> 42:45.280]  look at their faces because to watch them premeditatedly perched on the public
[42:46.080 --> 42:52.080]  feeding on everyone makes me want to throw up but i was sitting there and just seeing how they do it
[42:52.080 --> 43:00.720]  well this is going to make latinos mad obama is going to wait till after the midterm elections
[43:00.720 --> 43:06.480]  he'd promised by the end of august to take executive action to legalize them by fiat and
[43:06.480 --> 43:12.240]  to stop deportations but he didn't do that well it's probably a good calculation because we
[43:12.240 --> 43:19.040]  can get more done later you know if we don't do this within that 30 seconds was just every word
[43:19.040 --> 43:26.720]  was a lie everything they said was a preposition propaganda point to reassert other mindless
[43:26.720 --> 43:33.360]  base propaganda first off the idea that if you're a quote latino
[43:34.800 --> 43:41.280]  set to be within five years the majority in the united states already the majority and under the
[43:41.280 --> 43:48.480]  age of 15 it's your country you really want to be socialist or globalist but they it won't take
[43:48.480 --> 43:56.880]  from a racial position it's your country you understand that but see they can sell oh no no
[43:56.880 --> 44:01.760]  it's your country when you saw on the gun control socialism and open borders with a collapsing latin
[44:01.760 --> 44:07.280]  america that everyone's trying to flee so here let's turn it into that completely let's politically
[44:07.280 --> 44:14.480]  adopt what did that there devaluation of the currencies paramilitary police it just it goes from
[44:14.480 --> 44:20.240]  there a b c d e f g you know it just just right down to z
[44:25.760 --> 44:33.520]  number one lie see every every two three words was a lie latinos are going to be angry because
[44:33.520 --> 44:42.000]  again reasserting repositioning reapplying that if you're quote latino we're going to tell you how
[44:42.000 --> 44:47.120]  to think and you are going to support the democratic party and you're going to support the north
[44:47.120 --> 44:53.360]  american union and you're going to support an open into this country with whatever we want to do
[44:53.360 --> 44:57.120]  into the north american union that's a bunch of foreign offshore globalists wanting to totally
[44:57.120 --> 45:05.120]  destroy us on record then they went on to say obama isn't going to act like he said he would
[45:05.120 --> 45:12.560]  because that was all a faint they already acted in january legalizing almost all the illegals
[45:12.560 --> 45:17.920]  five years to even three years to five years even have a deportation hearing totally fake
[45:17.920 --> 45:22.480]  just legalizing whoever can come here loading them on government paid for buses and shipping them
[45:22.480 --> 45:28.240]  to democratic party facilities where the democrats get six to seven thousand dollars per group of
[45:28.240 --> 45:33.920]  three people they put in each house as a new form of income to the churches and democratic party
[45:33.920 --> 45:40.400]  operatives to literally house and sponsor the invasion and then shut up another house with
[45:40.400 --> 45:45.520]  that new group within one year to then bring the next phase in to those homes and then you get
[45:45.520 --> 45:50.000]  another home and you move them in and that's the plan and no one can even see it happening
[45:50.000 --> 45:59.120]  in plain view a military asymmetrical program within five years it will empty out the populations
[45:59.120 --> 46:04.800]  of guatemala nicaragua and el salvador mainstream news that's the congressional budget office looked
[46:04.800 --> 46:12.800]  at obama's amnesty plan that he's done by fiat would empty out the entire populations of three
[46:14.160 --> 46:24.080]  latin american countries el salvador nicaragua and guatemala the boldness this is 21st century warfare
[46:24.080 --> 46:31.600]  and it's to bring the country down and turn us into something like guatemala
[46:32.880 --> 46:37.200]  politically and the elites are all in big government districts armed fortresses while
[46:37.200 --> 46:44.960]  we're all out here literally bankrupt on our knees but don't worry there'd be government handouts
[46:44.960 --> 46:48.560]  just enough to keep you under their control like chavez in venezuela
[46:48.560 --> 46:55.360]  who i mean you talk about diabolical precision
[46:57.280 --> 47:01.920]  now i'm just giving you 30 seconds of one thing i sat there and i watched almost an hour or 45
[47:01.920 --> 47:07.840]  minutes of it and i had to see the drug ads and the project i see all the programming
[47:07.840 --> 47:18.080]  now they think we're so disconnected from reality that they're saying imminent terror
[47:18.080 --> 47:24.000]  attack in el paso at fort blitz we're sitting our reporters there right now it could happen within
[47:24.000 --> 47:33.200]  days two weeks prepare for it going to happen and the borders wide open and they've basically sealed
[47:33.200 --> 47:39.440]  the base feds one of eminent terror threat on us border sources say isis operators will use vehicle
[47:39.440 --> 47:50.640]  born improvised explosive devices in attacks and again if an attack comes it'll be a real attack
[47:50.640 --> 47:56.640]  or it could be provocative it could be totally staged and they just claim some isis group that
[47:56.640 --> 48:04.160]  have some nsa or fbi produced video come out as we've caught them doing before with the cia putting
[48:04.160 --> 48:09.040]  the government logo that the pentagon logo in the same video layer as the al-qaeda logo
[48:12.880 --> 48:18.960]  with the grandson of the former head of the adl who's jewish supposedly commanding al-qaeda i mean
[48:18.960 --> 48:30.480]  why does anyone even buy this it's just it's just so ridiculous and so that's what we're facing
[48:32.240 --> 48:36.480]  is they may drive in some crazy jihadis right across the border with a dump truck full of
[48:37.120 --> 48:42.640]  you know two tons of c4 and it blows up a third of the military base like the bay root attack on
[48:42.640 --> 48:48.560]  the embassy you got an area of the us embassy overrun and taken over and tripling you got us
[48:48.560 --> 48:55.920]  drone strikes in samalia targets al shabaab leader scores killed as boka haram insurgents
[48:55.920 --> 49:03.440]  overrun nigerian town 5000 flee for their lives war propaganda works large majority of americans
[49:03.440 --> 49:12.080]  now what military action in syria and iraq to quote take out isis but all they're going to do
[49:12.080 --> 49:19.600]  is end up guaranteed bombing quote other people too oh we think uh the iraqi government fired a
[49:19.600 --> 49:26.480]  missile we think Assad did it and the public's so dumb they'll go yeah that Assad when al-qaeda has
[49:26.480 --> 49:32.080]  been there for four years attacking him here's that story by steve watson war propaganda works
[49:32.080 --> 49:36.720]  large majority of americans now want military action in syria iraq complete turnaround on attitudes
[49:36.720 --> 49:43.760]  from one year ago and it's a 180 turn in the polls from 70 plus percent being against it the other
[49:43.760 --> 49:54.960]  way around some polls 60 to 20 so there you go meanwhile get this in the uk if you say you
[49:54.960 --> 49:58.960]  don't like open borders they will come and arrest you saying it's a thought crime i'm not getting
[49:58.960 --> 50:05.280]  look it up if you say the word homosexual they say that's hurtful and they will have you arrested
[50:05.280 --> 50:11.360]  like robin page the bbc presenter but the jihadis are allowed to be on tv calling for blowing the

[50:19.200 --> 50:24.080]  agreed by conservative party and liberal democrats to give them a training course when they come

[50:28.880 --> 50:35.920]  up non-radical muslim musk and that we're going to give you a government course that's because
[50:35.920 --> 50:44.320]  they work for them the head of the 77 bombings that came out was mi6 the us fbi even admitted that
[50:44.320 --> 50:50.000]  admitted that on fox news okay it's run by the globalist i'm trying to explain that again

[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:58.720]  go through all these exhibits for people because it's important to see it but pakistan
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:04.080]  has been putting up with so much new old order garbage
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:08.000]  our government
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:12.960]  since 9 11 bipartisan
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:21.920]  has been in there trying to overthrow their secular government and overthrow their military
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:27.600]  that's been one of the only countries long running that stop the new old order
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:31.760]  taking them over and i'm not romanticizing pakistan it's got corruption and some problems
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:41.760]  but they brought the 40 000 jihadis in to us bases in pakistan after 9 11
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:48.960]  the real al qaeda and taliban was picked up brought in to start destabilization over there
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:53.360]  and and and then the globalist hit one button and their jihadis all over the world start
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:59.600]  blowing stuff up attacking trying to take over pakistani military bases and media complexes
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:06.480]  again then the west will come in and bomb those very people posing as the saviour which
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:10.960]  further stirs people up against the pakistani government saying do something about this stop
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:15.840]  working with america but pakistan's playing the same double game so you can argue the only way
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:20.800]  to survive this is being macky of ellie but at a certain point it gets so macky of ellion
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:24.000]  that there is no policy anymore
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:31.440]  and i'm not depending the pakistani leader either it's a very complex situation it's just that
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:38.000]  you see the arab spring being stirred up by google by mi6 by the state department and we
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:45.200]  told you that four years ago when it all started it's now admitted that they saw the revolutions
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:51.520]  coming so using social media and allowing the groups they wanted to operate and to recruit
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:59.200]  they basically steered the dam that had already broken for revolution they steered the water where
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:05.040]  they wanted it to go that's the best way to describe it they they ride the bucking bronco
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:12.240]  and they study it everything we face is scientific social control
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:17.760]  so in fact what i'm going to do is i'm going to air the deramik brain piece when we come back
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:23.440]  and then we will go to your phone calls i think that's the best way to do it
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:30.480]  i want to hear from first time callers about what do you think the most important issue is out
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:37.360]  there right now or is it the fact that they're trying to stimulate mega crises across the board
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:43.120]  and that it's that attempt to create the global crisis to bring in the world government as Henry
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:48.800]  Kissinger just wrote in the wall street journal last week how do you stop something like that
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:54.160]  how do you get the public to see outside the box it's a mind trick once you get outside of it
[01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:57.440]  you're like how did that ever fool me to begin with it's like the matrix

[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:24.160]  more than 42 million smokers in the united states well over a thousand types of mold and mildew
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:28.800]  linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that six million americans live with pets

[01:07:54.880 --> 01:08:03.520]  three eight eight eight two five three three one three nine aldis huxley the author of a brave new
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:11.680]  world he said in an interview back in 1958 that the social engineers of the future they will figure
[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:18.160]  out a way to enslave us by tricking us and conditioning all of us into thinking that we
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:25.040]  are actually free this was also well thought out and researched by the father of propaganda
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:34.320]  edward bernay's who in his 1928 book propaganda bernay's wrote if we understand the mechanisms
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:42.160]  and motives of the group mind it is now possible to control and regiment the masses according to our
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:48.640]  will without them knowing it he called it the engineering of consent and proposed that those
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:54.960]  who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:09:00.480]  true ruling power of our country right so are we living in an orwellian nightmare that was
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:06.560]  prophesied by the likes of george orwell aldis huxley and edward bernay's well i did some research
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:13.760]  and i put together some video clips that shows how the globalist mind control has been present in
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:21.600]  our everyday lives our entire lives because the future is now you're listening to the alex jones
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:31.280]  show we're live on the second day of september if you want to preserve your power indefinitely
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:38.320]  you have to get the consent of the ruled and this they will do faster by drugs as i foresaw in
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:48.400]  in brave new world faster by these new techniques of propaganda they will do it by bypassing the
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:56.560]  sort of rational side of man and appealing to his subconscious and his deeper emotions and his
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:10:04.480]  physiology even and so making him actually love his slavery i mean i think this is the danger that
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:11.680]  actually people may be in some ways happy under the new regime but they will be happy in situation
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:17.840]  where they're open to be happy this is the big picture an official television report to the
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:25.520]  nation from the united states army yes and modern warfare our military leaders are finding that words
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:31.120]  and ideas are highly effective weapons here recruits with specialized backgrounds were taught
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:37.360]  the nature methods and techniques of propaganda and its dissemination radio presents these facts
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:46.080]  in any number of ways perhaps its most rewarding form of expression is news for news is ready made
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:52.880]  propaganda and to an enemy denied access to outside information it's as welcome as food and water
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:59.920]  radios principle advantage is that it can reach remote areas and reach them quickly so that one
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:06.320]  program can be repeated and thereby reach a larger audience it is often recorded on discs or on tape
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:11.200]  the same show can be rebroadcast at convenient times in different areas
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:20.000]  unfortunately you've grown up hearing voices that incessantly
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:25.120]  warn of government is nothing more than some separate sinister entity that's at the root of
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:29.040]  all our problems they'll warn that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:37.920]  you should reject these voices public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:45.440]  technological elite my team and my specialties information operations and and the psychological
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:50.400]  arm of things we are trained to deceive if we have to if you found out that your public
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:55.440]  affairs team that was showing you around actually had that just had completed a 40 hour course in
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:12:00.960]  psychological operations it was trained in scyops and a military deception you start to question
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:05.760]  hey is that an appropriate use of that resource you shouldn't trust me in fact by my actually
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:09.840]  participating that i will taint the news they took the babies out of incubators
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:18.240]  took the incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor they had kids in incubators
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:24.240]  and they were thrown out of the incubators so the Kuwait could be systematically dismantled
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:29.120]  go read a book by the father of modern advertising Edward Bernays recalls you a dumb slave that
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:34.880]  admits they run your whole life i've read both his major books one of them is called propaganda
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:41.600]  Edward Bernays psychological warfare operations went into high gear our propaganda was beginning
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:51.040]  to pay off there's a global crime syndicate the controls nato and the major western governments
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:59.360]  and it is using al-qaeda to overthrow secular governments also can't see sending my son to
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:06.080]  fight with islamic rebels against christians i also can't see my son going to fight without on the
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:13.680]  same side as al-qaeda the people we are fighting today we funded 20 years ago it was almost as if
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:30.160]  it were a planned implosion it's just pancaking well pancaking almost like a precision enclosure
[01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:43.840]  millions of people are sick and tired of the endless wars the poverty that is coming the
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:49.360]  attacks of our civil liberties i don't believe in conspiracy theories conspiracy's yes i believe
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:55.520]  it there's nothing theory about it you take the blue pill the story ends you wake up in your bed and
[01:13:55.520 --> 01:14:03.440]  believe whatever you want you take the red pill you stay in wonderland and i show you how deep the
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:07.600]  rabbit hole goes meantime there are questions multiplying today about the mysterious death
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:13.360]  of award-winning journalist michael hastings we are also requesting that your team of advisors
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:27.120]  include a senior officer who is thoroughly experienced in psychological operations psychological
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:32.640]  warfare was established as a special staff agency this move had far-reaching results
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:37.120]  you consider yourself tomorrow i would very definitely say that i uh i uh i may mark that
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:44.240]  correct this america citizen obama depends on your next decision what if the whole purpose
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:49.760]  of government was to negate freedom what if freedom was a myth what if the constitution
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:54.560]  meant nothing to the governor what if everything the government has the rounds of controls has been
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:15:00.320]  stolen it's what we're doing here unless not a kid about it we're building a domestic army and
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:06.080]  we're shrinking the military because the government is afraid of its own citizens this is what we
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:10.480]  have to look forward to all over the place look how quick within a matter of days they were able
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:16.400]  to go into a martial law status here in furgus that they have its entire bridge is road blocked off

[01:15:45.520 --> 01:16:01.440]  the answer to 1984 is 1776

[01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:22.240]  my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern mexico where the chiapas farmers
[01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:27.760]  grow their unique shade grown arabica beans we have now managed to secure the sought after beans

[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:07.040]  while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee available at info wars life dot com
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:14.320]  now again that was about a seven-minute segment from friday night's info wars nightly news
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:21.520]  complete with the 32nd ad for coffee at the end of it that's what we do is basically fund our
[01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:26.640]  own operation with high quality products that are organic and that we personally use and believe in
[01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:32.320]  but dealing with the issue of mind control manipulation it's going on it's happening
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:42.160]  and the people working in the government are just as manipulated or more so than people that aren't
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:51.040]  in it and under this global governance system it is select top corporations and banks that
[01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:59.440]  write the global laws set the policies give themselves diplomatic immunity and remove themselves
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:05.920]  from being able to take responsibility for anything they're basically the unseen hand
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:11.920]  they think the public so stupid though that books are written reports are issued it's all
[01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:17.360]  very public and that's my big frustration is you could debate me about my interpretation
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:23.600]  of some of this stuff and i am occasionally wrong about this or that but if you're tuning in
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:31.280]  to the alex jones show and listening to me alex jones for the first time i want to beg you to not
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:38.960]  believe a word i say and to go research the claims we're making because when you find out that i'm
[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:46.160]  telling you the truth 95 percent of the time we do make mistakes some of the time and when you find
[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:55.200]  out that most the time it's worse than i'm saying you'll realize we've got to do something i want
[01:18:55.200 --> 01:19:00.720]  to give the number out for first time callers where do you see our world going is there a way
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:05.200]  to shake people out of their mind control what do you think about the world becoming so unstable as
[01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:09.600]  the secretary of defense has said and obama is countering that saying there's no problem it's
[01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:16.640]  the media making people think there's a problem now a second american journalist has been beheaded

[01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:38.480]  syria who gave him the weapons the west did it came out in senate hearings last year the expansion
[01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:47.120]  of support stopped but it's like having a pet rattlesnake that you hand feed mice to you reach
[01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:54.000]  in there one day to feed it a baby mouse it's going to bite you on the finger and that's what's
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:35:00.720]  going on with is an al qaeda again almost every terror attack is either provocateur where they
[01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:06.000]  find a mentally ill person and wind them up to do it and then let them attack to get more funding
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:11.760]  and take liberties or it's a criminal group directly funded by criminal elements in the
[01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:17.280]  government who are real jihadis but are protected and all the doors are open for them that's one
[01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:23.280]  of the most common forms of attacks that's what this is going to be or it's completely totally
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:28.480]  staged and they have patsies they set up like mohammed adai and others who we know were trained by
[01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:38.480]  the cia and defense intelligence at the well the sacramento be reported on it uh there at the war
[01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:45.600]  college uh training facility the defense language school
[01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:53.120]  and people blew the whistle that five of the supposed hijackers were really u.s government
[01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:59.520]  agents we don't know exactly what happened on 9 11 we just know there's a cover-up of what did
[01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:06.560]  and the official story doesn't add up and 9 11 was used to take our basic freedoms
[01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:15.280]  and transform this country into an oligarchal tyranny a totalitarian orwellian system that
[01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:21.200]  we're transforming to that we're slouching into that we're sliding into well what is cnn and
[01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:27.760]  fox news and msnbc do they come out and say alex jones says that george bush with a detonator like
[01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:33.920]  wiley coyote blew up the towers alex jones says the firefighters blew up the towers
[01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:41.280]  because it's the government and they're the government i never said anything like that
[01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:47.600]  i said there's clearly explosives in those towers these people are being tracked they were being
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:53.440]  protected why are we attacking iraq when it's supposedly saudi arabia behind it look at the
[01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:58.960]  norad stand down look at the cia drills of the towers being attacked that exact same day at that
[01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:05.280]  exact same time look at the 9 11 tapes the air traffic takes look at the police on video live
[01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:12.080]  on cnn going get back they're going to bring down building seven you see that building it's coming down
[01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:20.400]  then cnn would say does alex jones think the police blew it up no there's video a cops going
[01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:26.800]  get back they're getting ready to bring it down i was buying a pizza that day i'd been on the air
[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:32.320]  since it started as a guest on jenesis did my own show and was and they had a night time show i did
[01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:40.720]  then i was on all day long took a break at four o'clock four they blew it up at 525 eastern 425
[01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:48.240]  central drove to the pizza place to pick up the pizza and heard cbs news radio which isn't even on
[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:56.000]  anymore report solemn brothers 47 story building uh they're going to bring it down to control
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:59.760]  demolition so that doesn't damage surrounding buildings i remember thinking gee how do you
[01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:04.400]  get bombs in a building that fast it takes some weeks to rig those properly from what i've read
[01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:09.600]  but it but lost in the fog i just went back and
[01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:17.280]  did the radio show and i remember saying yeah it looked like they blew that up the next day and
[01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:22.800]  blah blah blah and then since then i remember saying i saw it and heard it on the news we have
[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:27.760]  the news we have bbc before it blew up saying it was going to collapse and then
[01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:35.840]  saying it a collapse when it hadn't collapsed yet not one bbc not two bbc's three bbc's and
[01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:40.960]  then they came out and said mr jones is lying that video is not real there was such a backlash
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:44.320]  people went and checked their archives they said we apologize that was a mistake
[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:53.920]  like roiders fed us the script exactly they jumped the gun two hours before it was released
[01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:59.920]  that it was lee harvey oswald they got time zones off in australia and in one other country
[01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:02.160]  what was it um
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:10.000]  indonesia and they had in the front page because you're back then they had afternoon
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:14.000]  editions of newspapers that came out newspapers in big cities came out every few hours might
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:20.000]  have had 20 editions and you know 10 different papers in new york at the time in 1963 and it
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:25.200]  famously came out lee harvey oswald before they'd even grabbed him or before his name
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:27.840]  had been released right around the time they were getting him at the movie theater
[01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:35.360]  so this stuff does come out ladies and gentlemen they do screw this up because
[01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:43.600]  the average person at the bbc is not part of it they're just reading a teleprompter
[01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:50.240]  but then we are changed london went and talked to the bbc news reporter who was talking to the
[01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:54.960]  reporter on the ground in front of building seven and they went to him and they said you
[01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:58.240]  reported that day it had fallen before it didn't get this real weird look on his face i've played
[01:39:58.240 --> 01:40:03.280]  it air and he goes no i was going to the movies with my daughter that day i didn't cover 9 11
[01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:08.720]  and he just smiled at him and they went yeah we have the video clip right here on our laptop
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:14.000]  he said doesn't matter i wasn't there and he smiled and walked right through him and left
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:19.760]  after his speech they went to a journalist forum i forget his name you can pull it up he's the
[01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:23.280]  guy talking to her from england and she's the british reporter on the ground
[01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:34.240]  his name is jane stanley it's just red-handed cops saying get back they're blowing it up
[01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:40.480]  and i even interviewed the cops that are on that video two of them and neither one would
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:42.560]  talk to me after i talked to them they got so many threats
[01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:53.520]  they said no it was the red cross was in command and they went ahead and told us even though they
[01:40:53.520 --> 01:40:57.200]  were told not to tell us to get back because they cared about the people a couple minutes before
[01:40:57.760 --> 01:41:03.200]  and then we even heard the countdown on their radio and we wondered why she see the red cross
[01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:10.000]  folks is the night's template basically it's the oldest continually operating intelligence
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:19.120]  agency for 500 years at least the red cross has been operating there it is we are change
[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:26.720]  uk phil hayton and wtc seven if you want to see the video from 2008 it is bomb shell
[01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:35.680]  and then he's done a few interviews make sure that's the one where he denies it
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:39.600]  because i don't want to be the wrong woman i'm sure that's it he goes no i took my daughter
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:44.960]  to the movies that day or my son no it was his daughter i was not working on 11 of course you
[01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:51.120]  would remember you were working on 9 11 he was on for like 10 hours that day but but this is how
[01:41:51.120 --> 01:42:00.880]  dumb they think we all are this is how stupid they think you are so now these people are about to
[01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:12.960]  hit us again with our border wide open and rick perry who certainly has his own fair share of
[01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:18.880]  problems did quietly put the state police on alert to look for radicals and and killers and people
[01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:24.320]  with criminal records on the border he did deploy the the national guard down there and we've now
[01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:29.440]  learned that obama tried to block it and he is working with a group of state senators and others
[01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:34.720]  that we've talked to off record who knew this was basically coming two years ago and had a
[01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:42.880]  contingency plan ready and the problem is is that obama won't even deport felons now so they're
[01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:48.000]  filling up state facilities with these violent felons and embarrassing obama as they're forced to
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:53.200]  release them and so what's their answer just indict rick perry in fact we have an article i'm
[01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:59.600]  going to put up on screen here about rick perry rick perry deletes truthful tweet concerning
[01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:06.160]  indictment witch hunt i don't always drive drunk at three times the blood alcohol limit even though
[01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:14.480]  she heads up the dwi task force the state task force but when i do i indict governor rick perry
[01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:19.600]  for calling me out on it and i'm the most drunk democrat in texas one of his people tweeted that
[01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:24.160]  out saw that like a week ago and then rick perry apologized for it
[01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:30.880]  rosemary lemburg show the governor is indicted
[01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:38.560]  for doing his job to veto seven and a half million dollars of funding for the public
[01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:43.680]  integrity office the state office that she headed up and turned out he tried to get democrats
[01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:47.840]  for months to put another democrat in there and have her step down just out of the public
[01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:57.680]  integrity office she'd still be da and they said no and why not because they know that if they can
[01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:02.080]  get away with having her in there while she's spitting and yelling and throwing fits and
[01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:06.800]  threatening the the sheriff's deputies and acting crazy and throwing temper tantrums on the ground
[01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:17.440]  kicking and screaming and looking like a piranha they can do anything if they could pass laws
[01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:23.520]  banning even the weakest hairdryers and tea kettles and wood burning stoves and they've
[01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:27.760]  already done this in europe now it's coming to england and it's already come to san francisco
[01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:33.280]  it's they can do anything you want to have gmo crops glyphosate in the water supply fine
[01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:38.640]  look at this political correctness then i'll get to this report and give the number out the toll

[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:55.200]  time callers 800 259 92 31 i want to cover any of these points i've thrown i want your take on it
[01:44:55.200 --> 01:45:04.080]  how fear of being seen as racist stop social workers saving up to 1400 children from sexual
[01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:10.720]  exploitation at the hands of asian men in just one town turns out it's an entire network of
[01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:16.320]  taking the kids all over the country out of the country in in savage gang rape rooms
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:27.200]  11 year old girls and boys but because they were pakistani it was politically
[01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:32.320]  incorrect well it's more than that the british government's full of this stuff as well
[01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:36.480]  and that's all over the british news the last week
[01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:45.280]  but it's it's not real political correctness it's that they're setting a precedent while i'm
[01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:49.120]  sorry if they're gang raping 11 year olds we we can't do anything because they're asian
[01:45:49.120 --> 01:45:53.040]  we're sorry we can't have anything on the border because you'd be racist we have to give you
[01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:56.240]  everything free because you're hispanic it has they're not going to give you anything free when
[01:45:56.240 --> 01:46:01.440]  they're done taking over folks this is just mindlessness of be socially nice do what we say

[01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:15.920]  your take on it hi alex i can't believe i'm talking to you i've been listening for six plus years
[01:56:15.920 --> 01:56:23.360]  and this is the first time i've ever gotten through calling um i think as a 23 year old
[01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:27.760]  young lady i can look at society and when i first started listening i took a look at
[01:56:27.760 --> 01:56:33.200]  the bank bailout and was like wow this is not right even at you know 17 i realized this isn't
[01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:37.920]  the right way so i started listening and started looking stuff up and really became aware of what's
[01:56:37.920 --> 01:56:42.800]  going on around me i feel like most people especially in rural communities know exactly
[01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:48.000]  what's happening to them so really i called to ask you a question is what what can we do as
[01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:54.400]  we're like as communities as people that are that are so friendly with each other on things like
[01:56:54.400 --> 01:56:59.040]  facebook and twitter where you fake no people but you don't actually talk to them you don't exchange
[01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:06.640]  real ideas you just say one liners that get you by as far as societal points go you get high fives
[01:57:06.640 --> 01:57:11.360]  for saying the right right it's all simulated fake social stuff that doesn't even help you
[01:57:11.360 --> 01:57:16.960]  or your family or them that's why you want real meaningful relationships you want to buy local
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:21.760]  you want to realize our culture of just basic freedom is under attack that all race colors
[01:57:21.760 --> 01:57:28.800]  and creeds should unite around private property not being surveilled having to process a basic
[01:57:28.800 --> 01:57:34.800]  prosperity and you point out the globalists are the enemies they're the ones occupying the country
[01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:40.960]  expose the occupation expose the global government plan expose that things are about to get a lot worse
[01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:46.480]  because the new world order is behind it they're going to try to pose as saviors as the next phase
[01:57:46.480 --> 01:57:52.800]  of their operation comes in realize the homeland security department of defense run rural affairs
[01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:59.440]  commission is meant to bankrupt and then take control in the bankruptcy of all rural areas
[01:57:59.440 --> 01:58:05.280]  realize they're taking land and property right use everywhere realize that we've all got a buck
[01:58:05.280 --> 01:58:13.040]  the system say no to stuff that's unconstitutional while backing local officials and public servants
[01:58:13.040 --> 01:58:17.840]  that do stand for the bill of rights and constitution not the government's perfect or even
[01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:23.440]  they're perfect but if somebody's promoting basic freedom into criminal back them if somebody's
[01:58:23.440 --> 01:58:29.840]  a crook go after them get aggressive don't comply stand up for yourself become americans

[02:01:26.800 --> 02:01:32.240]  let's talk to walton new york thanks for calling walton hey alex how you doing good brother thanks
[02:01:32.240 --> 02:01:36.560]  for calling alex i'm gonna bring up a subject here that's tied in with everything you're talking
[02:01:36.560 --> 02:01:41.520]  about a broad range of subjects and i hope you see how it ties in uh... obama is about to sign
[02:01:41.520 --> 02:01:47.120]  an executive order that will uh... take the wolf off of the endangered species list and they're
[02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:51.040]  going to have a hunt in uh... idaho where they're going to basically exterminate the wolves they're
[02:01:51.040 --> 02:01:55.760]  going to kill 80 to 90 percent of them they may not ever recover and this is all done you know
[02:01:55.760 --> 02:02:00.320]  while people are distracted with other things we were people's basic heart where what what
[02:02:00.320 --> 02:02:05.440]  happened to people's love their basic well that's been done as a stunt to act like
[02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:10.480]  like hillary saying she's pro-gun now and doesn't like obama it's getting her position to run and
[02:02:10.480 --> 02:02:16.720]  and i feel like like sarah palin uh... and and and i mean at the same time i do understand i mean
[02:02:16.720 --> 02:02:22.320]  the uh... i i i like canine familiar as i'm a big dog lover uh... there are areas where the wolves
[02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:27.760]  have become overpopulated again i really don't know the details to be able to properly speak to
[02:02:27.760 --> 02:02:32.720]  that i was not aware that obama was even set to sign that executive order
[02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:37.120]  you know this is something that is going under the radar because there's so many things going on at
[02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:43.440]  one time and the basic tactic seems to be to uh... get people uh... distracted with one thing and
[02:02:43.440 --> 02:02:48.320]  then do something else and people just can't keep up but if people would attend to their basic
[02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:55.040]  humanity and and just their basic gut level feelings you know it says live and let live it says
[02:02:55.040 --> 02:02:58.720]  do unto others as you would have them do unto you these basic truths
[02:02:58.720 --> 02:03:03.840]  will serve us and since we as a civilization have given up these basic truths we're just
[02:03:03.840 --> 02:03:11.120]  drifting into god knows what i mean the the tall 20th century is a story of how the christian
[02:03:11.120 --> 02:03:15.120]  ethic regardless of whatever your true actual religion is how the christian ethic has been
[02:03:15.120 --> 02:03:19.600]  just thrown in the garden certainly true that fraud and corruption is up that people are
[02:03:19.600 --> 02:03:24.720]  becoming more and more decadent more and more fly by night and that's pretty much a a symptom of our
[02:03:24.720 --> 02:03:29.920]  prosperity uh... but but now we're living on borrowed time that's how it always ends up
[02:03:30.480 --> 02:03:34.240]  so i'm really worried once the bottom falls out how all these spoiled rotten people are going to
[02:03:34.240 --> 02:03:39.520]  behave i appreciate your call walton and i'm on the high horse i'm i'm pretty decadent
[02:03:39.520 --> 02:03:42.720]  and spoiled compared to the worth work ethic of my ancestors
[02:03:43.440 --> 02:03:51.520]  so i tell you it's it's it's it's a fascinating world uh... blake in oklahoma you're on the

[02:10:29.040 --> 02:10:32.720]  dr paul craig roberts is going to be joining us then we'll go back to your calls and a bunch of
[02:10:32.720 --> 02:10:38.640]  news i've not yet gotten to our reporters are about to be in the air from austin down to el
[02:10:38.640 --> 02:10:45.200]  paso where the border is still we've confirmed from our military sources wide open with ices saying
[02:10:45.200 --> 02:10:51.280]  that they're going to attack and homeland security saying it is imminent imminent attack now we saw
[02:10:51.280 --> 02:10:57.200]  lots of fake terror alerts and stuff like that before ices is a real group being funded and protected
[02:10:57.760 --> 02:11:03.680]  but regardless when they attack they were funded and protected to attack syria and other countries
[02:11:03.680 --> 02:11:08.400]  in a proxy war against russia in the last four years that's now been confirmed senator ted
[02:11:08.400 --> 02:11:13.120]  cruz has gone public ran paul and public and stopped a year ago along with the general public
[02:11:14.960 --> 02:11:19.280]  now they're back and we have polls out today out of gallup and others showing a majority
[02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:25.440]  wanting strikes in syria and iraq because of ices the very group protected by the west the very
[02:11:25.440 --> 02:11:29.760]  groups they've been using and chetching in other areas to attack russia in the interest and i'm
[02:11:29.760 --> 02:11:36.320]  no russian file i'm no never been to russia but i've studied it and russia is not in an
[02:11:36.320 --> 02:11:42.000]  offensive posture starting things right now now i'll tell you who is an expert on russia he was part
[02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:47.440]  of the negotiations for the fall of the soviet union uh as the head of policy of the father
[02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:53.360]  ergonomics dr paul greg roberts also the former editor of the wall street journal and a best-selling
[02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:58.080]  author and top economist i want to get into the latest because nato has already been deploying
[02:11:58.080 --> 02:12:01.760]  troops and weapons and they've already got advisors undoubtedly there are some russian troops in
[02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:07.680]  eastern ukraine to guard their infrastructure military bases that's been on record uh nato
[02:12:07.680 --> 02:12:13.520]  weighs rapid response force for eastern europe i will take keavan two weeks or i could take
[02:12:13.520 --> 02:12:17.520]  keavan two weeks as latimer putin in that two and a half hour talk he gave but they're saying
[02:12:17.520 --> 02:12:23.680]  that was taken out of context regardless russia is hardening its stance and last time dr paul
[02:12:23.680 --> 02:12:30.640]  greg roberts was on he was talking about how he's in a rock and a hard place if russia if putin
[02:12:31.440 --> 02:12:36.160]  offensively takes part of ukraine which nato's already done taking over the country in their
[02:12:36.160 --> 02:12:42.560]  coup of six months ago he'll be called a warmonger if he doesn't russian hardliners will come after
[02:12:42.560 --> 02:12:48.960]  him now we have the former deputy have the cia coming out last week and saying you kill putin
[02:12:48.960 --> 02:12:55.600]  or we're gonna basically attack you to the russian government or or will kill him incredible
[02:12:55.600 --> 02:13:04.560]  provocations on fox news so this is not iraq we're kicking around here okay this is russia
[02:13:04.560 --> 02:13:10.960]  and putin reminded last week that they have a rapid response high tech compact nuclear weapon
[02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:15.520]  system so with that setup because some stations only carry the third hour i bring you dr paul
[02:13:15.520 --> 02:13:21.520]  greg roberts joining us via video skype to look at this the isis threat and the economy in the
[02:13:21.520 --> 02:13:28.640]  time we have dr roberts thank you for joining us so please alex where to begin it just gets crazy
[02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:37.200]  here by the moment it really is crazy um it's not clear to me alex uh what the united states
[02:13:37.200 --> 02:13:44.320]  thanks it's up to trying to start a war with russia and it's not clear to me uh why the idiots
[02:13:44.320 --> 02:13:49.920]  and the european capitals would go along with it since they certainly would cease to exist very
[02:13:49.920 --> 02:13:57.840]  quickly so what is what is the basis of all this it's just hard to know i mean i know the neoconservatives
[02:13:57.840 --> 02:14:04.880]  are crazy there in fact i would say that they're they're insane but it's hard to see why they think
[02:14:04.880 --> 02:14:14.240]  that they can make forces in the Baltics or poland or wherever a threat to russia they can't do that
[02:14:14.240 --> 02:14:21.840]  it's this is not it's not possible so what what is all this about it's there's a lot of propaganda
[02:14:21.840 --> 02:14:29.360]  and as you said correctly is extremely provocative and i think uh what i'll have to say about this
[02:14:29.360 --> 02:14:37.840]  is that the united states is the government in washington is terrified that the europeans
[02:14:37.840 --> 02:14:45.040]  are developing economic and political relationships with russia that would pull eventually uh
[02:14:45.040 --> 02:14:52.240]  nato countries out of washington's orbit the nato would be dissolved and that the american
[02:14:52.240 --> 02:14:59.680]  hedge enemy over the world would simply cease to exist and so they're trying to provoke the russians
[02:15:00.560 --> 02:15:09.120]  into an action that washington can use to browbeat the europeans and convince them that look russia's
[02:15:09.120 --> 02:15:16.560]  dangerous russia's dangerous you need us to protect you you can't do without us and to force a break
[02:15:16.560 --> 02:15:24.560]  in the economic relationships between uh europe and russia i think that's what this game plan is
[02:15:25.440 --> 02:15:35.040]  so far putin has not sent troops to the ukraine and has not done anything provocative because he
[02:15:35.040 --> 02:15:42.240]  knows that the the pressure that washington is putting on the europeans the sanctions and all
[02:15:42.240 --> 02:15:50.320]  of that they basically hurt europe not russia and so he's waiting for the europeans to finally see
[02:15:50.320 --> 02:15:58.880]  that the washington's crazy and to disassociate from uh washington's leadership so i think that's
[02:15:58.880 --> 02:16:07.040]  essentially what it is and because they haven't been able to stir putin into action they're getting
[02:16:07.040 --> 02:16:12.720]  more and more thrilled they meaning washington is getting more and more thrilled pumping up
[02:16:13.680 --> 02:16:22.880]  its mouthpieces more and more and making the wildest kinds of accusations that just ordinary
[02:16:22.880 --> 02:16:29.360]  people are beginning to see through you don't really have to know too much to understand that if
[02:16:29.360 --> 02:16:35.840]  there were russian military units in ukraine or if russia invaded ukraine the war would be over
[02:16:35.840 --> 02:16:41.360]  instantly there wouldn't be any government in Kiev the whole country would be occupied it would only
[02:16:41.360 --> 02:16:49.920]  take a few hours so people keep talking about a russian invasion and it's not possible if the
[02:16:49.920 --> 02:16:55.280]  russians are there were to invade that would be the end of the ukraine it would happen very quickly
[02:16:56.000 --> 02:17:02.880]  there's no capability of resisting the russian military and so people is beginning to dawn on
[02:17:02.880 --> 02:17:11.200]  people that this this this simply is not so so how it plays out i don't know what will how much will
[02:17:11.200 --> 02:17:16.400]  washington pay its puppets to sell out their own well i agree i think it's more than paying them off
[02:17:16.400 --> 02:17:20.480]  it's been confirmed as you've talked about for a long time that william benny's exposed it at the
[02:17:20.480 --> 02:17:28.320]  nsa they are blackmailing and targeting basically everybody with these snoop systems and they can
[02:17:28.320 --> 02:17:34.320]  turn hackers loose on people to plant stuff on your computer you name it anybody that doesn't go
[02:17:34.320 --> 02:17:41.440]  along with this gets demonized in the media gets set up gets arrested gets demonized gets persecuted
[02:17:41.440 --> 02:17:51.440]  look at all the irs stuff it is just a gangsterism yeah the fascist police state that's what our
[02:17:51.440 --> 02:17:57.280]  country has become alex i want to be specific from our sources and also the russian news but also
[02:17:57.280 --> 02:18:02.640]  the ukrainian news there are some russian troops at bases that have been there for hundreds of years
[02:18:02.640 --> 02:18:07.920]  both naval and army and they have been protecting some of their border checkpoints and have been
[02:18:07.920 --> 02:18:15.120]  having soldiers bringing convoys of food who have them been arrested but then to say that that's an
[02:18:15.120 --> 02:18:22.160]  offensive russian force going out and trying to you know take ukraine and he's invaded every two
[02:18:22.160 --> 02:18:29.440]  or three days the president of ukraine says that i harken back to 2008 uh when i woke up and saw
[02:18:29.440 --> 02:18:36.160]  singing and saying russia has invaded georgia and i was still naive in 2008 i went to my wife honey
[02:18:36.160 --> 02:18:41.760]  russia's invaded they're crazy and then later hours later it came out no actually georgia attacked
[02:18:41.760 --> 02:18:46.960]  the russian bases on the border in south ossetia and abkhazia and the russians came and kicked them
[02:18:46.960 --> 02:18:54.320]  out but our media is show 1984 i mean i studied north korean propaganda it's about the only
[02:18:54.320 --> 02:19:01.120]  propaganda that's sillier and just more over the top than ours yeah yes i'm not even sure the north
[02:19:01.120 --> 02:19:07.600]  korean one is worse but you're right did you see that uh washington post editorial on august 31st
[02:19:08.160 --> 02:19:15.280]  about uh was putin right about putin uh being a liar and he's deceiving the world and he's
[02:19:15.280 --> 02:19:21.440]  a maniac and he's did you see that yes i saw that one too then i saw another one saying
[02:19:21.440 --> 02:19:28.720]  was the right in syria so it's almost a schizophrenia we're saying well we don't have
[02:19:28.720 --> 02:19:38.400]  any media except uh online and you you're you provide far more real news than the new york
[02:19:38.400 --> 02:19:46.880]  times or cnn or any of them all added up so the only media the west has is the alternative media
[02:19:47.600 --> 02:19:55.440]  the rest of it is a ministry of propaganda let me ask you your view on a raft of issues quickly
[02:19:55.440 --> 02:20:00.080]  again dr paul craig roberts top economist joins us a high-level reg administration
[02:20:00.640 --> 02:20:05.280]  official as well and also worked with the downfall of russia so he um is aware of
[02:20:05.280 --> 02:20:09.840]  a lot of different angles here when we look at the economy we got joe biden yesterday saying
[02:20:09.840 --> 02:20:14.320]  america's in a lot of trouble we have secretary defense hagel saying the whole world's blowing up
[02:20:14.320 --> 02:20:18.640]  close quote obama comes out and says that's the media making you think it's blowing up
[02:20:18.640 --> 02:20:24.080]  well actually they'll exaggerate things that aren't a big deal like gun deaths and then make
[02:20:25.040 --> 02:20:30.240]  you just light of something huge like starting a war with russia or isis running around how would
[02:20:30.240 --> 02:20:35.440]  you quantify working with the big think tanks and other groups that you work with the state of the
[02:20:35.440 --> 02:20:42.320]  world right now i had former top cia analyst uh on rey mcgovern friday and he said the world is in a
[02:20:42.320 --> 02:20:47.120]  more dangerous situation now in the cuban missile crisis and and he basically said you cannot
[02:20:47.760 --> 02:20:54.400]  overplay how serious things are what's your take on the state of the world yes i think that it is a
[02:20:54.400 --> 02:21:01.120]  very serious situation as you know i've been pouring it out for some time it's very dangerous uh for
[02:21:01.120 --> 02:21:07.600]  washington uh in the western media to continue to promote russia and china the way that they do
[02:21:08.240 --> 02:21:15.760]  it's it's almost insane uh both of these countries are are are nuclear powers and they're not
[02:21:15.760 --> 02:21:21.440]  threatening us they're not threatening us they're not threatening their neighbors but when you tell
[02:21:21.440 --> 02:21:29.200]  china that uh the south china sea is an area of american national interest and you start building
[02:21:29.200 --> 02:21:36.880]  new naval and air bases from the philippines to vietnam to can uh to contain china and you show
[02:21:36.880 --> 02:21:43.600]  russia that you that you see them as an enemy that has to be defeated and you're putting
[02:21:43.600 --> 02:21:48.560]  anti ballistic missile bases on their borders and you're causing them trouble in their backyard
[02:21:48.560 --> 02:21:54.240]  you really are and you and you have a nuclear doctrine of preemptive first strike
[02:21:55.600 --> 02:22:00.800]  then you tell those countries my god these people are crazy uh what are we going to do
[02:22:00.800 --> 02:22:08.160]  and so you can very easily end into a disastrous war so i think that that is true that
[02:22:08.160 --> 02:22:18.400]  uh washington uh fearful of losing its control over europe is pushing the world to the brink of war
[02:22:18.400 --> 02:22:26.800]  as for the american economy it really isn't one it has never come out of the uh recession in 2008
[02:22:28.400 --> 02:22:35.680]  the the europeans are all in the same sort of situation we are the british uh there's nothing
[02:22:35.680 --> 02:22:42.640]  to drive these economies the wealth and income is increasingly concentrated in a few hands
[02:22:43.200 --> 02:22:49.200]  there are no jobs for university graduates the the rate of unemployment among the young is very high
[02:22:51.520 --> 02:22:58.800]  the the countries that are tied into the american payment system established after world war two
[02:22:58.800 --> 02:23:05.600]  they're all suffering they're all subject to being blackmailed and and destabilized by washington
[02:23:05.600 --> 02:23:11.200]  and we're on the verge of big changes i think you're going to see the end of the dollar payment
[02:23:11.200 --> 02:23:17.840]  system this is now already in the works this is going to further erode and seriously impede
[02:23:18.800 --> 02:23:25.600]  american influence and washington's power and american living standards which are already under
[02:23:25.600 --> 02:23:32.240]  pressure and they're going to take a big jolt down there's going to be more political instability
[02:23:32.240 --> 02:23:38.000]  we now have essentially an armed police state you know homeland security all these tanks and
[02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:43.680]  weapons and blah blah and the police are militarized so i think it's a very serious situation it's
[02:23:43.680 --> 02:23:50.080]  probably as serious as the world has ever experienced and it's a paradox because the
[02:23:50.080 --> 02:23:54.560]  political class ran corporation others in documents i've read from the eighties nineties
[02:23:54.560 --> 02:24:00.080]  they foresaw all this but then said it should be capitalized on and how the political elite
[02:24:00.080 --> 02:24:06.800]  could get even more power out of their national stabilization force and out of establishing
[02:24:06.800 --> 02:24:12.640]  all this but then if you really study it it's delusional they think they're in control but
[02:24:12.640 --> 02:24:18.640]  they're not and only fools history has shown would would destroy a wealthy powerful system and soft
[02:24:18.640 --> 02:24:25.920]  power that you've talked about to replace it with you know it it reminds me of like the argentinians
[02:24:25.920 --> 02:24:31.440]  in 1982 with a military dictator so they start a war with the british and the falcons arrogantly
[02:24:32.160 --> 02:24:38.400]  it it it it it feels like that it it feels like desperation and i'm starting to agree with you
[02:24:38.400 --> 02:24:45.760]  more that it is mental illness that there really isn't even a real policy here and then i look at
[02:24:45.760 --> 02:24:52.640]  the three women running the state department that are red faced warmongers i mean it really scares me
[02:24:52.640 --> 02:24:59.280]  yeah you should be scared there there is a conspiracy it's the neoconservative
[02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:06.960]  in fact the neoconservative conspiracy is far more dangerous than the Rothschild conspiracy
[02:25:07.520 --> 02:25:14.400]  or any of the others and these people have this ideology of american supremacy they're just
[02:25:14.400 --> 02:25:20.000]  essentially like nazis we are exceptional we are indispensable that those that don't know
[02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:24.960]  uh right my government said the same thing when he was on friday people said well boy this is
[02:25:24.960 --> 02:25:30.480]  obama neo libs how is it neoconservatives explain to people who's really running this
[02:25:30.480 --> 02:25:36.240]  administration's foreign policy well the the three women you you mentioned the state
[02:25:36.240 --> 02:25:41.600]  department they're all neoconservatives they're they're well known so so is samantha powells
[02:25:41.600 --> 02:25:46.480]  in fact the whole government is it has been since clinton's second term
[02:25:46.480 --> 02:25:52.640]  um so they run the government they run state department they run the defense department
[02:25:52.640 --> 02:26:00.080]  they run the national security council they run security agencies it doesn't mean that every
[02:26:00.080 --> 02:26:04.480]  one everybody in the sea i agree with them they don't no they hate them they're they're
[02:26:05.200 --> 02:26:10.560]  they're in the positions of uh controlled spokesperson and policy implementation
[02:26:11.280 --> 02:26:15.520]  and they're driving this uh to war i mean that's where we got the middle eastern wars
[02:26:15.520 --> 02:26:20.720]  this came from these and that's where i wanted to go next how do they have the border wide open
[02:26:21.600 --> 02:26:27.680]  and then meanwhile say an attacks imminent in in el paso at fort blitz with isis which might
[02:26:27.680 --> 02:26:31.520]  actually happen because i've got good sources down there saying it's crawling with them down there
[02:26:32.240 --> 02:26:37.040]  and how does obama and and and the neocons think they're going to get away with allowing an attack
[02:26:37.040 --> 02:26:43.120]  here when clearly they've opened the door i don't think that isis is going to attack us if
[02:26:43.120 --> 02:26:49.040]  if there's an attack it'll be a false flag oh probably him and they blame it on isis that's
[02:26:49.040 --> 02:26:56.720]  where all this comes from look isis has his hands full in syria and iraq is creating a new state
[02:26:56.720 --> 02:27:02.160]  is carving out a new country partly from iraq partly from syria they don't have any time to
[02:27:02.160 --> 02:27:07.040]  go over here and fool around on the mexican border they don't have any this is this is a
[02:27:07.040 --> 02:27:14.720]  total diversion from what they're trying to do and uh so when you hear anybody telling you oh
[02:27:14.720 --> 02:27:19.360]  isis is it means it's going to be a false flag attack and they've got somebody in you to blame
[02:27:19.360 --> 02:27:25.280]  they can't blame bin laden anymore because they claim they killed him 10 years after he died they
[02:27:25.280 --> 02:27:32.560]  killed him and and so and al cater is sort of disappeared we now have isis uh sometimes i agree
[02:27:32.560 --> 02:27:39.680]  with you that a false flag is is very probable but isis itself being armed by the west is the
[02:27:39.680 --> 02:27:45.200]  false flag and they have killed more journalists now chop another one's head off the day and they've
[02:27:45.200 --> 02:27:51.120]  said we're going to attack the west if you don't keep bombing us or if you don't stop bombing us
[02:27:51.120 --> 02:27:57.760]  and up top they're being manipulated by different moles inside our agencies from my research i don't
[02:27:57.760 --> 02:28:03.680]  know it's just i don't think so i think that uh they're they're they're focused on the middle east
[02:28:03.680 --> 02:28:07.520]  and when they say they're going to attack the west they're talking about western interests
[02:28:07.520 --> 02:28:14.400]  in the middle east sure and they're not going to waste their time and energy to come over here and
[02:28:14.400 --> 02:28:20.080]  blow up a building or shopping center or whatever they decide it doesn't do them any good dhs would
[02:28:20.080 --> 02:28:26.960]  do that to take our liberties that they would do that for that reason i think right now the
[02:28:26.960 --> 02:28:32.480]  government uh in washington to the extent we have a government is focused on russia
[02:28:32.480 --> 02:28:38.960]  and they're trying to drive their puppets in europe sure into confrontation with russia because
[02:28:38.960 --> 02:28:45.280]  they want to break off the economic relationships between europe and russia which threaten the
[02:28:45.280 --> 02:28:48.640]  american empire what do you think germany's going to do in the one minute we've got left
[02:28:50.320 --> 02:28:56.320]  i you know everybody in germany is opposed to merkel did you see the protests this weekend in
[02:28:56.320 --> 02:29:04.080]  resident they're calling a warm manga warm manga liar liar no war with russia we've you saw benny's
[02:29:04.080 --> 02:29:11.760]  letter to merkel uh i think that and you've seen the businessmen and germany telling her don't you
[02:29:11.760 --> 02:29:17.840]  be a fool we don't want to do this so it really depends whether washington has her so much in
[02:29:17.840 --> 02:29:22.960]  their grip that she has to do what washington says regardless of the opposition of her own people
[02:29:22.960 --> 02:29:28.480]  will find out they've been tapping their phones we'll find out all right thank you for the time

[02:33:47.280 --> 02:33:53.840]  i want to be clear though the reason you see so much corruption intensifying worldwide is a
[02:33:53.840 --> 02:34:03.200]  lot of reasons but hollywood's corruption uh populations battling for scarce resources
[02:34:04.400 --> 02:34:08.480]  that's part of the natural ebb and flow of society is just now we have nuclear weapons
[02:34:08.480 --> 02:34:16.640]  biological weapons drones you name it but the political elites are so removed from the battlefield
[02:34:16.640 --> 02:34:22.480]  so removed from what they're politically doing that that's a big part of why we see things getting
[02:34:22.480 --> 02:34:29.200]  so dangerous i think about the neocon women that run the state department cement the powers and others
[02:34:30.320 --> 02:34:35.120]  when they give speeches or briefings if i saw someone at a restaurant who looked and acted
[02:34:35.120 --> 02:34:38.640]  like them i would say that's a very dangerous mentally ill person
[02:34:41.040 --> 02:34:46.080]  hillary clinton if she was just a normal person with her statements and the way she acts and looks
[02:34:46.080 --> 02:34:54.640]  i would say that's a neurotic bad person on a power trip look out and i always hear oh if women
[02:34:54.640 --> 02:35:00.320]  ran things there'd be no war in the world what a load of bull it's not i'm not attacking women
[02:35:00.320 --> 02:35:05.680]  right now it's just that the whole gimmick of hillary clinton i have been looking at her
[02:35:05.680 --> 02:35:13.680]  her since 1992 22 years since high school
[02:35:16.800 --> 02:35:21.280]  when that whole presidential election was going on i'm 40 i'm sick of her
[02:35:22.880 --> 02:35:27.440]  and i'm gonna have to hear the gimmick of oh you're not for hillary you don't like women
[02:35:27.440 --> 02:35:32.480]  and women's groups for their science time for hillary time for a woman to be in charge she's
[02:35:32.480 --> 02:35:39.200]  been in charge and the republican leadership has their way they're gonna have some socialist
[02:35:40.480 --> 02:35:46.960]  crumbum neocon fake rhino run against her and hand it to her
[02:35:48.880 --> 02:35:52.080]  and if this country doesn't get upset and i don't mean the whole country
[02:35:53.280 --> 02:35:58.400]  but the large minority of people who are every race color and creed who know what's going on if
[02:35:58.400 --> 02:36:05.440]  we don't get upset just start saying no then stick a fork in us we're done because it's just getting
[02:36:05.440 --> 02:36:14.160]  worse and worse and worse and crazier and weirder and stupider they teach kids two plus two equals five
[02:36:14.160 --> 02:36:18.160]  when i first learned about that in common core like three or four years ago i'm with that's not
[02:36:18.160 --> 02:36:23.200]  true that's a headline and i wouldn't looked it up and they had real curriculum saying two plus two
[02:36:23.200 --> 02:36:30.160]  is them always four it could be three or five it's all how you feel and then obama said i didn't
[02:36:30.160 --> 02:36:37.600]  build my operation and then increasing a debt doesn't increase the debt i mean it makes me so angry
[02:36:38.880 --> 02:36:43.040]  the new york times came out over the weekend curtain emma wrote an article about it endorsing
[02:36:43.040 --> 02:36:50.240]  the death panels and there were people commenting on my website going well there are you know
[02:36:50.240 --> 02:36:54.000]  there's not enough money blah blah blah if you didn't have government involved and it was free
[02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:58.640]  market and charities the care would be competitive and super cheap we had the best and cheapest
[02:36:58.640 --> 02:37:03.760]  health care in the world in 1950 look up the numbers now we've got some of the most expensive
[02:37:03.760 --> 02:37:09.840]  screwed up health care that's because government got involved regulators got involved and they
[02:37:09.840 --> 02:37:16.720]  screwed this country up and i'm tired of sitting here in the country i love watching it go to
[02:37:16.720 --> 02:37:24.880]  hell in a hand basket all a bunch of foreign offshore globalist i went into a jewelry store

[02:37:43.920 --> 02:37:48.880]  this place and there was a picture of warren buffet and i said what's warren buffet have to do is
[02:37:48.880 --> 02:37:55.040]  go oh warren buffet bought this family owned jewelry chain and i went in there because i knew it was
[02:37:55.040 --> 02:38:03.040]  a family owned jewelry chain out of uh seattle and i and i still got the stuff and then left
[02:38:05.440 --> 02:38:09.920]  but i do they carried some of that tiffany stuff i just go it doesn't even matter the point is it's
[02:38:09.920 --> 02:38:15.440]  just like one of my buddies lives in a building downtown and i looked at who owned it i always
[02:38:15.440 --> 02:38:20.800]  looks as warren buffet and i was just thinking about how he's got all these banker bailouts all
[02:38:20.800 --> 02:38:25.280]  these insider deals and then he lobbies to raise taxes on poor people makes me want to throw up i
[02:38:25.280 --> 02:38:31.120]  don't want to just get off on some warren buffet jag but i was in a jewelry store and had to look at
[02:38:31.120 --> 02:38:41.440]  him all because i wanted to get my daughter some jewelry and teach him how to take care of stuff
[02:38:42.160 --> 02:38:43.680]  so they can wear it to church or whatever
[02:38:50.400 --> 02:38:52.720]  and i've got all these calls all this important news it's just
[02:38:54.800 --> 02:39:00.320]  i am fundamentally being robbed and screwed over by people like warren buffet and bill gates i
[02:39:00.320 --> 02:39:04.160]  know what they've committed against me i know who they are i know how they're funding the whole
[02:39:04.160 --> 02:39:07.440]  gun control agenda along with george soros i don't like them
[02:39:10.720 --> 02:39:16.960]  because they've dominated me they're screwing over my country i love why don't you take it
[02:39:16.960 --> 02:39:26.640]  personal i mean i see guys i was at the grocery store and i was in line and these two guys were
[02:39:26.640 --> 02:39:35.600]  arguing with each other about who was going to win some labor day football game they were getting
[02:39:35.600 --> 02:39:40.160]  aggressive with each other and showing off and oh yeah well there they've got a deeper you know
[02:39:40.160 --> 02:39:45.360]  weapons arsenal blah blah blah on the side and oh yeah well they've got such oh yeah and it's like
[02:39:45.360 --> 02:39:50.160]  men are supposed to be like that about you know over this hill is where the line of the such as
[02:39:50.160 --> 02:39:54.800]  that tribe is and if you cross that they will attack you for hunting in that area but i believe
[02:39:54.800 --> 02:39:59.760]  that we should be able there because my grandfather hunted in that area you know that's a 10 000 year
[02:39:59.760 --> 02:40:05.280]  old worldview or a thousand years ago about you know we need to get together and form a military
[02:40:05.280 --> 02:40:09.920]  alliance with this tribe because we're going to be hit by the and sacked by these vandals that you
[02:40:09.920 --> 02:40:17.040]  know hit us 20 years ago again and they've been raiding up and down the coast i mean men are supposed
[02:40:17.040 --> 02:40:23.440]  to be knowing how things work involved serious honorable warriors at the same time at least
[02:40:23.440 --> 02:40:30.880]  look at men they're just laying out acting cool and they're so unmanly even if they're all
[02:40:30.880 --> 02:40:38.160]  roided out and acting tough with a shaved head a man knows about geopolitical issues a man
[02:40:38.880 --> 02:40:45.760]  knows about finances a man knows how the world works a man is involved and it's because we are a
[02:40:45.760 --> 02:40:53.120]  dishonored society that isn't led by good men we are led by the worst men and worst women out there
[02:40:53.120 --> 02:41:01.600]  imaginable and we have accepted lie after lie after fraud after fraud until we don't even know who we
[02:41:01.600 --> 02:41:08.560]  are anymore let me tell you it's a big deal to have that southern border open and to just be flooded
[02:41:08.560 --> 02:41:14.800]  with people with u-hauls and trucks and and and just buses just full i mean i'll pull into a
[02:41:15.520 --> 02:41:19.600]  target or something and it's just they'll be like three buses with just people pouring out with
[02:41:19.600 --> 02:41:28.640]  their bags obvious refugees like whoa what is going on as the country collapses as we go into
[02:41:28.640 --> 02:41:35.440]  depression what is the government planning and then i don't disagree with roberts completely
[02:41:35.440 --> 02:41:40.080]  i'm the guy that used to debate with him 10 years ago about whether 911 was an inside job or not
[02:41:40.080 --> 02:41:44.560]  he came around to the fact that it is that's the guy that's in the you know all these big huge
[02:41:44.560 --> 02:41:53.200]  think tanks brookings you name it i mean he's high level folks so when i get up here and i say no
[02:41:53.200 --> 02:41:58.560]  isis is real isis is the most radical dangerous people there are they're allowed to go back and
[02:41:58.560 --> 02:42:02.720]  forth to england back and forth to france they're being left they're allowed to operate on twitter
[02:42:02.720 --> 02:42:10.000]  and facebook it's in the news again today whereas they're always censoring my stuff and
[02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:18.080]  and i happen to know that this terror threat is real from our military and border patrol sources
[02:42:18.080 --> 02:42:23.520]  i can't say anymore i don't want to get subpoenaed or get arrested okay because this is national
[02:42:23.520 --> 02:42:28.240]  security stuff i'm just going to leave it at that that they're being told shut up this stuff's
[02:42:28.240 --> 02:42:33.600]  being leaked do you think obama wants people know there's isis down the border no they want to
[02:42:33.600 --> 02:42:38.160]  let him hit us and then he'll just play dumb and the media won't call him he'll get away with it
[02:42:38.160 --> 02:42:45.440]  and take basic freedoms of americans no the al-qaeda people are working with the drug cartels
[02:42:47.520 --> 02:42:54.320]  because it's very similar criminal culture operations strongman operations whole nine yards
[02:42:54.320 --> 02:43:01.440]  there's a lot of saudi arabian money there is an islamicist move a radical islamicist move

[02:44:11.040 --> 02:44:19.040]  welfare and free rides everywhere this is not enough i want everything now just marching around
[02:44:19.040 --> 02:44:25.760]  everywhere and obama you see see that cover it's a full spectrum of lies they create a whole paradigm
[02:44:25.760 --> 02:44:32.320]  of fraud where you're just swimming in an ocean of lies and so obama had none enough for latinos
[02:44:32.320 --> 02:44:37.280]  as if that's what as if you are hispanic in any way you're supposed to just want totally open
[02:44:37.280 --> 02:44:43.520]  borders when no one else does that in the world and when it's collapsing countries the depression
[02:44:43.520 --> 02:44:50.000]  is global folks the depression is here it's worse than latin america and the message is being sent
[02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:55.280]  come here so the numbers are getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and when
[02:44:55.280 --> 02:45:00.800]  you lose your job or your bankrupt i want all of you to remember when this country looks like
[02:45:00.800 --> 02:45:08.160]  guatemala city i want you to remember it may feel good to be trendy it may feel good to
[02:45:08.160 --> 02:45:15.600]  love obama the lord and savior is jamie fox calls it but he's not and it's part of a bigger plan
[02:45:15.600 --> 02:45:23.680]  north american union the elite live in luxembourg monnie carlo geneva switzerland they live in grand
[02:45:23.680 --> 02:45:35.440]  caiman they live in the cook islands they do not live here the idiot hollywood people do the all
[02:45:35.440 --> 02:45:40.160]  that it's all going to blow away folks it's all the end of a ponzi scheme and i think they're
[02:45:40.160 --> 02:45:44.640]  going to use the giant hordes of illegals as the cover for why we collapse or something i mean this
[02:45:44.640 --> 02:45:49.840]  is so diabolical legion of doom level stuff okay and it's not going to help all these poor refugees
[02:45:49.840 --> 02:45:59.360]  blake go ahead and tell folks what you saw thanks for holding well i i think the most important thing
[02:45:59.360 --> 02:46:08.480]  that each of us individually can do is when something happens more before it happens print
[02:46:08.480 --> 02:46:15.680]  awesome documentation from your website go to your local news station i know that they're all
[02:46:15.680 --> 02:46:20.560]  you know part of the dinosaur and media that there are still people that work in them that are local
[02:46:20.560 --> 02:46:26.800]  they care about the local communities if everybody just you know ignored the fact that it might be a
[02:46:26.800 --> 02:46:32.000]  little embarrassing because you know most of the trendy people you know say oh where's your tinfoil
[02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:37.840]  hat ho ho ho yeah if you're like two plus two equals four they go oh tinfoil hey we ought to be
[02:46:37.840 --> 02:46:44.560]  involved in and defend our liberties weirdo yeah those people don't count some of them
[02:46:44.560 --> 02:46:51.200]  even still do that after you show them a video that proves something like from your website
[02:46:51.760 --> 02:46:58.000]  and i think one of the most important things to do is say we have to turn around before
[02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:03.520]  the bottom drops out we have to do something beforehand because well they've never been through
[02:47:03.520 --> 02:47:08.160]  the bottom falling out so they think it's funny like it's going to be some spectator event like
[02:47:08.160 --> 02:47:12.560]  everything like oh there's going to be a depression and war on the streets that'll be entertaining
[02:47:12.560 --> 02:47:17.920]  like when we blow up Iraq or something and the both sides are dying you know and and and again
[02:47:17.920 --> 02:47:22.640]  i've been told by liquor store owners and pizza place owners that when they launch a new war that's
[02:47:22.640 --> 02:47:28.640]  when record pizzas and and wings and liquor sold and everybody just goes home and oh look at them
[02:47:28.640 --> 02:47:33.360]  bills getting blown up well let me tell you when America collapses all these yuppies i think
[02:47:33.360 --> 02:47:38.400]  everything's funny and and where they're ignorant like a suit of armor you're going to find out what
[02:47:38.400 --> 02:47:42.800]  it's like let me i'll tell you what they're going to do is they're going to politically enslave all
[02:47:42.800 --> 02:47:47.360]  of us the producers it's not pretty folks it's not pretty i'm not trying to be negative i'm just
[02:47:47.360 --> 02:47:52.320]  it's like you pull through a green light somebody runs it and everything goes into slow motion as

[02:53:13.840 --> 02:53:19.520]  out for a quick buck deciding to take action a company run by patriots for patriots was born

[02:54:21.120 --> 02:54:26.320]  special reports at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com i want to go to john in the uk then
[02:54:26.320 --> 02:54:34.560]  danie and john and others uh first i never even got to this on the show today it's huge revelation
[02:54:34.560 --> 02:54:42.320]  official army admission but really pass say here for our audience because we've covered it so much
[02:54:42.320 --> 02:54:49.840]  which u.s. army plans to battle anti-government dissidents in mega cities close quote future
[02:54:49.840 --> 02:55:00.000]  operations will neutralize groups which undermine the authority of the state so see
[02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:06.240]  criticizing the state is bad they will neutralize it including using propaganda but also physically
[02:55:06.240 --> 02:55:13.680]  and this is a new article where the army itself in army times dot com that tells the army's
[02:55:13.680 --> 02:55:21.040]  capabilities in its integration center and it's for use overseas but also domestically
[02:55:22.800 --> 02:55:27.040]  now the reason the army's so awake now and listens to this show is they heard me say this was coming
[02:55:27.040 --> 02:55:30.800]  forever because i knew it was going on a more compartmentalized groups now that it's going
[02:55:30.800 --> 02:55:36.240]  to full bore training and they're bad mouthing george washington thomas jefferson gun owners uh
[02:55:36.240 --> 02:55:42.240]  rural communities the training is so over the top evil that it's just totally waking the military up
[02:55:44.080 --> 02:55:47.840]  but they don't care then they just move those people to foreign combat operations
[02:55:47.840 --> 02:55:53.360]  or downsize them and then use the people that go along with it to become the new domestic stability
[02:55:53.360 --> 02:56:03.200]  force which are just crazy political dangerous authoritarian nuts believe me you don't want
[02:56:03.200 --> 02:56:08.800]  to be a soldier in the civil war that is that's like wanting to play in traffic and i don't want
[02:56:08.800 --> 02:56:14.000]  to fight with you either i i just think you're idiots i mean anybody that goes along with this
[02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:19.920]  just just i just can't believe how dishonorable you are the good news is the military is not
[02:56:19.920 --> 02:56:24.560]  going along with it see that's what i mean is a real disconnect here with the political elite
[02:56:24.560 --> 02:56:29.760]  now stuff isn't even making sense anymore from their perspective because i can war game their plan
[02:56:29.760 --> 02:56:35.360]  and what they're doing and it's just congress has a seven percent approval rating on average
[02:56:35.360 --> 02:56:41.360]  some of them as low as six the government's basically already fallen that's why dr paul
[02:56:41.360 --> 02:56:50.000]  kirk robert said our governments he doesn't really function anymore it doesn't it's just
[02:56:51.040 --> 02:56:56.400]  it's like the soviet union or something it's just a bunch of crazy kleptocrats and the only
[02:56:56.400 --> 02:57:02.720]  ideology they've got is is like a weird leftist hatred but it's not even leftist it's like this
[02:57:02.720 --> 02:57:10.640]  weird anti-human control freak anti-family hatred of america thing i i just it's just
[02:57:10.640 --> 02:57:16.800]  it's really despicable that this level of scum runs things let's talk to john in the uk then we'll
[02:57:16.800 --> 02:57:21.840]  go to overdrive and go to danie john in the uk what's your take on obama meeting with nato about
[02:57:21.840 --> 02:57:28.240]  russia right now isn't that just special in fact i don't know if you're aware um but i'm actually
[02:57:28.240 --> 02:57:33.440]  about 1500 meters away from hms duncan which they just bought in eight hours ago i'm in
[02:57:33.440 --> 02:57:41.280]  cardiff right now and your president well your your alleged president is um flying in tomorrow i
[02:57:41.280 --> 02:57:46.720]  know you called in about that what's your take on the whole russia situation but actually i mean
[02:57:46.720 --> 02:57:50.080]  there's quite a lot of ground i'd like to cover so i'd be very grateful if you're to try to bear
[02:57:50.080 --> 02:57:55.920]  with me um what what i'm very concerned about uh having walked around cardiff and had a look at
[02:57:55.920 --> 02:58:01.840]  some of the security measures that they seem to be taking uh is that they are actually genuinely
[02:58:01.840 --> 02:58:07.520]  serious about the prospect of a terrorist attack here in cardiff and i wouldn't be remotely surprised
[02:58:07.520 --> 02:58:14.800]  if there were some kind of attack um on this coming thursday morning um now my my concern is
[02:58:15.360 --> 02:58:22.880]  that if there is a terrorist attack it's going to be used as a diversion um to disguise the the
[02:58:22.880 --> 02:58:30.880]  real agenda that they have which is to essentially um compute their preparations for war with russia
[02:58:30.880 --> 02:58:35.040]  what do i mean by that stay there this is this is vital i'm gonna come right back to you sir

[03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:44.160]  of a larger plan and again some of these terror attacks because israel terrorist group they're
[03:00:44.160 --> 03:00:51.520]  just being turned loose like piranhas and in your pool i agree i'm not there but i've seen the
[03:00:51.520 --> 03:00:57.120]  preparations i've talked to military sources i've got and they say no we've heard all the fake
[03:00:57.120 --> 03:01:02.480]  terror alerts and those same sources have told me when they're fake they're saying by this september
[03:01:02.480 --> 03:01:07.840]  11 they are expecting terror attacks in europe the uk and the united states now that may not
[03:01:07.840 --> 03:01:14.800]  happen but the word is we're basically standing down for something because it can all be a diversion
[03:01:14.800 --> 03:01:19.280]  from what's happening in russia so that really clicks what john in the uk was saying please continue
[03:01:19.280 --> 03:01:26.080]  john yeah thank you um what i was trying to explain what i meant when i said that i think
[03:01:26.080 --> 03:01:34.160]  that a terrorist attack here could function as a diversion um to disguise the the real agenda um
[03:01:34.160 --> 03:01:38.640]  you see what i what i'm concerned will happen is that if there is a terrorist attack here
[03:01:38.640 --> 03:01:44.720]  and i would remind you that riad khan is from cardiff and there are known cells that function
[03:01:44.720 --> 03:01:51.440]  from cardiff um if there is a terrorist attack here that will be an ideal pretext for the government
[03:01:51.440 --> 03:01:57.120]  to say oh dear look we need to to be very careful about the flow of funds uh we need to implement
[03:01:57.120 --> 03:02:03.760]  much more stringent measures with respect to um movement of funds within the country now i think
[03:02:03.760 --> 03:02:10.320]  you you're you're aware that we owe something like 500 of our gdp here in the uk at the moment
[03:02:10.320 --> 03:02:15.360]  and when you factor in our obligations our future obligations in terms of social security and
[03:02:15.360 --> 03:02:21.840]  pensions it's something like 900 which is pretty much what it was um you know when they were
[03:02:21.840 --> 03:02:32.480]  decorating their walls with um you know banknotes uh in uh in germany in the 1940s now um i just just
[03:02:32.480 --> 03:02:37.760]  to give you a little bit of background without wasting your time um i work abroad i'm only currently
[03:02:37.760 --> 03:02:44.000]  in the uk i've got i've got a flat here uh in the bay which is one of the five locations locally
[03:02:44.000 --> 03:02:50.400]  that they're hosting these meetings with these 60 world leaders um and i work abroad i have a number
[03:02:50.400 --> 03:02:57.760]  of um foreign businesses and uh within the last year or let me say 18 months i've had two of my
[03:02:57.760 --> 03:03:05.520]  accounts frozen and it's not just um lagart uh you know uh what's her name i am fm yeah yeah yeah
[03:03:05.520 --> 03:03:11.680]  it's it's also your people um there there you may have an account you're operating a legitimate
[03:03:11.680 --> 03:03:17.360]  business trying to fund your workers just doing normal everyday stuff nothing exciting um and
[03:03:17.360 --> 03:03:23.840]  then you get an accusation from the treasury that your bank may be supporting his or something and
[03:03:23.840 --> 03:03:28.560]  when meanwhile the government is protecting him supporting him letting him back in they use the
[03:03:28.560 --> 03:03:34.240]  threat in general yes all over the western world they're now training us for internal currency
[03:03:34.240 --> 03:03:40.560]  controls capital controls getting us ready for bail ins training us that our money isn't our money
[03:03:41.680 --> 03:03:47.360]  yeah i don't know if you've read the report taxing times on the imf website uh sometime in the middle
[03:03:47.360 --> 03:03:54.160]  of last year no i haven't but we're okay well christine the guard was um advocating the idea
[03:03:54.160 --> 03:04:00.320]  that um they should just siphon off 10 percent oh yes i i did see the derivative news articles
[03:04:00.320 --> 03:04:06.640]  off that report yes i did see that okay but personally i think when you look at it when you
[03:04:06.640 --> 03:04:10.960]  look at say the uk debt and the uk is very significant economy within the context of what's
[03:04:10.960 --> 03:04:16.960]  going on in the european union at the moment if there's an increase in interest rates 10 percent
[03:04:16.960 --> 03:04:24.240]  is not going to be anything like um ambitious enough for the guard and people working with her
[03:04:24.240 --> 03:04:29.360]  so i think they actually need some kind of a crisis which is going to be able to justify
[03:04:29.360 --> 03:04:32.960]  uh yes sir i actually stay there i'm going to come back to you can pull up the article
[03:04:32.960 --> 03:04:39.440]  from last year they want a marshal plan around a military conflict that's large enough to take
[03:04:39.440 --> 03:04:46.640]  the bankruptcy of europe and the e u into a global super state and the detonator is ukraine
[03:04:46.640 --> 03:04:50.240]  which is what you're saying they want to line it up for russia i want to get your final take on
[03:04:50.240 --> 03:04:58.080]  that john we're going into more overdrive danie and then um jack and john and film from novice

[03:07:04.800 --> 03:07:09.920]  more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air outside that's toxic indoor air
[03:07:09.920 --> 03:07:14.240]  has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor
[03:07:14.240 --> 03:07:19.360]  air and most americans spend 90 percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their
[03:07:19.360 --> 03:07:24.640]  homes there are more than 42 million smokers in the united states well over a thousand types of
[03:07:24.640 --> 03:07:29.600]  mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that six million americans
[03:07:29.600 --> 03:07:34.080]  live with pets they're allergic to as well when i began to research these statistics it was clear
[03:07:34.080 --> 03:07:39.600]  to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we
[03:07:39.600 --> 03:07:44.720]  cannot escape but that we can fight back against made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and

[03:08:10.880 --> 03:08:18.640]  fix bayonets we are now entering overdrive with your host alex jones broadcasting live from the
[03:08:18.640 --> 03:08:26.320]  front lines if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance as threat of nuclear war
[03:08:26.320 --> 03:08:31.600]  grows public attention turns to justin beaver public's preoccupation with beaver's personal
[03:08:31.600 --> 03:08:36.240]  live highlights decline of western society yeah it's it's one of the top search terms instead
[03:08:36.240 --> 03:08:41.360]  of uh nuclear war stuff like that we're finishing up with john in the uk a very interesting caller
[03:08:41.360 --> 03:08:46.880]  sees a multinational businessman getting his his uh the bank accounts paying employees messed with
[03:08:46.880 --> 03:08:54.640]  constantly by the uk and the us what's happening is medium size and small time international
[03:08:54.640 --> 03:08:59.600]  business people are being harassed everything's being shut down you're not allowed to legally
[03:08:59.600 --> 03:09:04.480]  take some money and put it in the bahamas or put it in switzerland uh that's after tax they come
[03:09:04.480 --> 03:09:10.000]  and steal that from you they just up to seven fold i think we're six full that's all the headline
[03:09:10.000 --> 03:09:16.240]  sunday the the cost to get rid of your u.s citizenship uh when i was flying out to los vegas
[03:09:16.240 --> 03:09:22.160]  a few years ago to be interviewed by jesse ventura for a tv show i saw them ripping through some guys
[03:09:22.160 --> 03:09:29.040]  deal and he had six silver coins and they were like what are these and he was a computer programmer
[03:09:29.040 --> 03:09:33.200]  turned out he'd flown on the same flight with me to vegas he was a listener he was oh alex jones
[03:09:33.200 --> 03:09:37.360]  i'll i'll tell you when i'm done so he comes over and talks to me and i did an interview put it out
[03:09:39.440 --> 03:09:45.200]  and uh they they were trying to take his five silver coins that he just took with him and he
[03:09:45.200 --> 03:09:51.360]  was going to go do some computer business for three days but while he was there he was going to go
[03:09:51.360 --> 03:09:56.160]  to a coin convention and just see what he could sell the coins for they weren't worked that much
[03:09:56.800 --> 03:10:00.800]  they weren't even really collectibles he just thought it was crazy they almost took him
[03:10:00.800 --> 03:10:05.040]  that's what this is all about you can get into the country they just don't want you to get out
[03:10:05.040 --> 03:10:10.000]  that's what ron paul said about seven years ago this border fence isn't for the illegals it's for us
[03:10:10.000 --> 03:10:17.600]  us and uh that's really what it is so finish up your point there john in the uk of nato meetings
[03:10:17.600 --> 03:10:23.120]  you're there in cardiff where this is all going on and his lordship his his his excellency barack
[03:10:23.120 --> 03:10:28.400]  obama will be arriving tomorrow but but alex um please allow me to jump straight to the main reason
[03:10:28.400 --> 03:10:33.840]  for this call and i'll be extremely brief um i concluded a while ago that if we don't counter
[03:10:33.840 --> 03:10:38.000]  attack if we don't do something about this eventually we're going to get totally done over
[03:10:38.000 --> 03:10:43.200]  and we're going to lose the opportunity to act um and so i started working on a project a couple
[03:10:43.200 --> 03:10:47.680]  of years ago i should let you know that actually i subscribed to your channel for 10 years i've
[03:10:47.680 --> 03:10:53.040]  been a listener to you for 10 years wow thanks for putting up with me no no no thank you very much
[03:10:53.040 --> 03:10:58.240]  indeed in fact a lot of your perspectives have actually informed my investment strategy um
[03:10:59.200 --> 03:11:04.720]  but anyway um so very often people call into your show and they say oh dear alex look what
[03:11:04.720 --> 03:11:10.400]  just happens to me people are stealing my children you know tsa is trying to kind of rake me in the
[03:11:10.400 --> 03:11:15.840]  open and all this kind of thing um and you say to them yeah send us an email but there's not really
[03:11:15.840 --> 03:11:22.800]  much more you can do and it occurred to me that the only way that we can actually um kind of gain
[03:11:22.800 --> 03:11:28.640]  kind of tactical domination of the info war is if we have a central portal where everybody can
[03:11:28.640 --> 03:11:33.600]  contribute like a moment ago you just had a guy called blake calling in and he said well he what
[03:11:33.600 --> 03:11:38.480]  he thinks we should do is and yeah i thoroughly respect his humility sounds like a great guy
[03:11:38.480 --> 03:11:43.600]  but what he essentially was saying is that we've got to go and grovel to these disingenuous people
[03:11:43.600 --> 03:11:48.240]  and we've got to go and supplicate them and hope that they're going to be willing to represent
[03:11:48.240 --> 03:11:53.600]  our concerns to the rest of the world i'd long thought we need to have our own central portal
[03:11:53.600 --> 03:12:00.080]  where we can all publish our own news articles and so using proceeds from some of my concerns
[03:12:00.080 --> 03:12:07.120]  i've uh created such a portal and i i wanted to present it to you um you know as you know like
[03:12:07.120 --> 03:12:13.360]  a junior warrior which which oh come on you're not a junior warrior no i'm serious i really am um
[03:12:13.360 --> 03:12:20.000]  and what this then means is that if for example you you're badly treated at a checkpoint or something
[03:12:20.000 --> 03:12:25.760]  like that you just get out your camera take a youtube video or whatever log straight into the
[03:12:25.760 --> 03:12:31.440]  site and upload it with the location data as well so it's like a people's leaks it's a news leaks
[03:12:31.440 --> 03:12:39.600]  where where we're constantly leaking reality yes exactly and it's also kind of geolocated
[03:12:39.600 --> 03:12:45.360]  so if there's trouble going down and somebody wants support or you see a story close to where you are
[03:12:45.360 --> 03:12:49.360]  you can navigate there and you can go and help and you can capture sounds like a genius idea let me
[03:12:49.360 --> 03:12:53.360]  ask you this what is the url because my cousin buckley was saying this guy sounds like an
[03:12:53.360 --> 03:12:57.360]  interesting fellow you ought to find out who he is and have him on as a guest tell us i mean are
[03:12:57.360 --> 03:13:04.320]  are you ready to tell folks about what you've created uh yes yes i am um the website is my
[03:13:04.320 --> 03:13:12.320]  reports dot com but it's spelled with an i and a z as you americans say so that's like m i r e p o r
[03:13:12.320 --> 03:13:19.200]  t z dot com well very interesting and and we'll check that out maybe get you on as a guest uh
[03:13:19.200 --> 03:13:24.400]  because that's a great idea i hope the site uh gets a lot of traffic so we can beta test it but
[03:13:24.400 --> 03:13:33.120]  it's m i colon reports with a z and and what's the actual url again yeah just w w w dot m i
[03:13:33.680 --> 03:13:41.520]  r e p o r t z dot com so you forget about the colon that's a distraction it's uh but based on um
[03:13:42.240 --> 03:13:48.720]  uh we've got a series but we don't advertise anything else because um you know i've got a
[03:13:48.720 --> 03:13:54.240]  kind of ongoing agenda to to work against the interests of large corporations because everywhere
[03:13:54.240 --> 03:13:59.840]  i go you see small businesses going bust they just can't compete sure because the big corporations
[03:13:59.840 --> 03:14:05.040]  get the laws written worldwide to shut you down it's not that we're against a walmart because they're
[03:14:05.040 --> 03:14:12.560]  just walmart and successful it's that they literally run game all actuaried out to shut
[03:14:12.560 --> 03:14:18.480]  everything down it look they're the ones financing not just walmart but berkshire hathaway you name it
[03:14:18.480 --> 03:14:25.120]  these moves to block lemonade stands and block farmers markets they want you only coming to them
[03:14:25.920 --> 03:14:32.640]  and it's suicidal to support these big chains and big operations i really appreciate your call
[03:14:32.640 --> 03:14:37.040]  and we'll check into that john very interesting caller very exciting people should go check that out
[03:14:37.040 --> 03:14:41.440]  give us your review of it uh danny in north carolina thanks for holding her on the air
[03:14:41.440 --> 03:14:49.920]  chill hey buddy hey uh alex i was calling you i wouldn't really want to talk about politics
[03:14:49.920 --> 03:14:55.600]  yes sir but i was wanting you to give a testimony to everyone out there about like our ancestors
[03:14:55.600 --> 03:15:00.160]  like how the Scottish and the irish and the saxons and then like our aboriginal like you
[03:15:00.160 --> 03:15:04.720]  talk about your aboriginal ancestors the native americans you give a testimony to everyone about
[03:15:04.720 --> 03:15:09.360]  like how that awakened the dna and how that feels can you give it quick that's normally
[03:15:09.360 --> 03:15:17.120]  now i got two points to think well i just saw a scientific report out over the weekend where
[03:15:17.120 --> 03:15:23.360]  they've again scientifically proven brain-to-brain communication basically esp it's like your brain
[03:15:23.360 --> 03:15:26.800]  is broadcasting there's a lot of things we don't understand but that all the ancients
[03:15:28.320 --> 03:15:33.200]  were aware of but again we don't know exactly how it works but they've now scientifically proven
[03:15:33.200 --> 03:15:41.200]  that it would take hours to get into it but i promise you i want to do a special report on
[03:15:41.200 --> 03:15:47.200]  epigenetics i'm going to get more scientists on on the subject but long story short it's not just
[03:15:47.200 --> 03:15:53.200]  in mammals they can take chickens and raise them for 10 generations inside of a room that
[03:15:53.200 --> 03:16:00.240]  doesn't have trees doesn't have images anything in it and then they can start projecting on the
[03:16:00.240 --> 03:16:05.520]  ceiling circles and things going by and they don't care but you have a hawk fly over they all
[03:16:05.520 --> 03:16:11.920]  squawk and scream and run and hide the chicken coop and then it is not learned it is an instinct
[03:16:11.920 --> 03:16:17.520]  and it goes way beyond that and so when you start fighting for liberty fighting for freedom fighting
[03:16:17.520 --> 03:16:23.920]  for survival that's why they say humans get better under stress it then activates all of these instincts
[03:16:23.920 --> 03:16:31.120]  that go beyond instincts and are just like compressed data with digital information
[03:16:32.400 --> 03:16:39.920]  we have compressed racial memory in there that has been passed on through the dna through the
[03:16:39.920 --> 03:16:49.920]  mitochondrial dna through all of it and the question is how complex is it or how detailed is it and
[03:16:49.920 --> 03:16:56.960]  and that's why they have ritual it's why they have rites of passage the system is aware of this
[03:16:57.520 --> 03:17:03.120]  and uses the knowledge to program what traits they want in the ancestral memories which areas
[03:17:03.120 --> 03:17:08.720]  they want to unlock versus areas they want to keep dormant and so they're activating our worst
[03:17:08.720 --> 03:17:15.680]  aspects to control us while trying to shutter our best aspects and they found in times of prayer
[03:17:15.680 --> 03:17:21.840]  in times of meditation that the brainwaves raise to a higher level and it begins unlocking a lot
[03:17:21.840 --> 03:17:26.160]  of that that's why they put the fluoride in the water the flicker rate in the tv everything is
[03:17:26.160 --> 03:17:31.520]  about suppressing brainwaves consciousness show that we don't go to the next level that we're
[03:17:31.520 --> 03:17:36.640]  meant to live in and care about being honorable and have a connection and have discernment they
[03:17:36.640 --> 03:17:42.160]  want to kind of dumb down and giggling and cynical and hateful and mindless and petty
[03:17:42.160 --> 03:17:50.400]  so that we don't transcend up to a level to be able to commune with God and the world is so complex
[03:17:51.360 --> 03:17:56.560]  it's again it's it's it's it's one cannot be told about the matrix one must see it but
[03:17:58.960 --> 03:18:06.000]  everything is about suppressing our awakening suppressing our development because you live
[03:18:06.000 --> 03:18:13.200]  again through your children but also those that live before us it's not just our children they're
[03:18:13.200 --> 03:18:17.200]  going to that we're going to live through and they're great grandchildren it's that we already
[03:18:17.200 --> 03:18:23.120]  are that expression of everybody before us it's so epic on this planet with our ancestors seeing
[03:18:23.120 --> 03:18:30.960]  that same moon that same sun and all the experiences and the and the shared griefs and the the racial
[03:18:30.960 --> 03:18:40.160]  cultural memories are all there and it's just so much more important than stupid hollywood stuff
[03:18:40.160 --> 03:18:44.800]  it's so much more important than somebody laughing at you because you're trying to warn them and it's
[03:18:44.800 --> 03:18:50.480]  their defense mechanism you see what a sad victim they are who don't have any connection to their
[03:18:50.480 --> 03:18:58.880]  past or whose ancestors were just incredibly you know just servile slaves uh to the system being
[03:18:58.880 --> 03:19:03.680]  a slave a lot of times means you're even stronger if you had that in your background versus people
[03:19:03.680 --> 03:19:08.800]  that come from someplace so corrupt and so evil that they're just a i mean the people say that's
[03:19:08.800 --> 03:19:13.600]  a bad family or that's a bad gene pool that's a bad group of people well you look at the globalist
[03:19:13.600 --> 03:19:18.320]  they want to kill all of us saying we've got bad gene pools they've got the bad psychopathic
[03:19:18.320 --> 03:19:24.800]  predatory gene pools and it's it's it's it's got to be dealt with and so it comes down to that this
[03:19:24.800 --> 03:19:29.440]  ancient battle that our ancestors fought with evil people and everybody's got to mix a good and bad
[03:19:29.440 --> 03:19:33.280]  in their background but it depends on the on the larger spectrum of it and then you do have free
[03:19:33.280 --> 03:19:39.120]  will you can choose you can choose what path you want to go down but if you have a preponderance
[03:19:39.120 --> 03:19:44.160]  of good people in your background you're going to gravitate towards the good no matter what it takes
[03:19:44.160 --> 03:19:50.480]  and then literally i am a manifestation of all the people that came before me and then it makes
[03:19:50.480 --> 03:19:57.680]  total sense that my ancestors acted just like i'm acting because it's who i am i am them they are me
[03:19:57.680 --> 03:20:21.600]  it's incredible communion
