[00:00.000 --> 00:06.360]  Already is deeply concerned today. You call the level historic. I mean, I've never seen anything like this
[00:06.360 --> 00:12.480]  I call it hysterical. I mean because it's scary to them. They know we know the truth, but
[00:13.160 --> 00:21.320]  What else do we do in the next eight days Roger to make sure the crime syndicate because even mainstream news is calling Hillary a crime
[00:21.320 --> 00:25.760]  Family, what do we do to make sure this crime family is fully discredited?
[00:25.760 --> 00:29.600]  Well, Alex, I've got to keep going back to Election Day and implore
[00:30.320 --> 00:33.720]  Those who believe in a fair and honest election, please
[00:34.200 --> 00:39.240]  Go to Southpasteel.org and sign up as a volunteer to work on Election Day
[00:39.240 --> 00:46.480]  We need your your elbow grease. We need your boots on the ground. We need your shoe leather to help us
[00:46.480 --> 00:56.120]  Brain forces here ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this last few months
[00:56.120 --> 01:02.080]  You probably notice I've been more crazed more focused less brain fog more energy more special reports
[01:02.080 --> 01:07.240]  And it's because a brain force one of the worst things with most energy products
[01:07.240 --> 01:10.960]  This is not sustainable, right? You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards
[01:10.960 --> 01:17.920]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols. Everybody's on these drugs and knock their brain out because the brain's so fried
[01:18.160 --> 01:23.120]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle
[01:23.440 --> 01:30.360]  For example the Lc and I inside of it that is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba mate that we put inside of it as well
[01:30.360 --> 01:34.720]  This just increases the compounds. You already have this is what you're actually designed to run on
[01:34.720 --> 01:38.960]  Exactly. It's kind of like a car. I'll run on one form of junkie gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for
[01:38.960 --> 01:50.840]  You will find a brain force survival shield x2 and other game-changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139
[01:50.840 --> 02:08.840]  Listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:21.840 --> 02:28.560]  I was there it's Monday November 7th 2016 less than 24 hours out
[02:29.160 --> 02:32.400]  We have now reached the critical crossroads in history
[02:32.880 --> 02:39.520]  The twilight of liberty the long dark night of tyranny or the rebirth of human freedom
[02:39.960 --> 02:41.960]  Not just to the United States, but worldwide
[02:43.840 --> 02:50.080]  Coming to you live from the info wars.com new studios in Austin, Texas and broadcasting worldwide
[02:50.080 --> 02:57.520]  This is the 52-hour live uninterrupted and global broadcast covering the 2016 elections
[03:01.720 --> 03:03.720]  I was there and I saw what you did
[03:05.560 --> 03:07.560]  You can wipe that smile off your face
[03:08.360 --> 03:10.360]  It's all been a big pack of lies
[03:10.600 --> 03:15.520]  Yeah, that's the promo from yesterday. We're now here in the space time continuum on November 8th
[03:16.880 --> 03:18.560]  2016 the big day
[03:18.560 --> 03:21.640]  Two years in the making campaign start earlier and earlier
[03:21.640 --> 03:26.040]  It's kind of like Christmas ends and the build up to the next Christmas begins. Well, we're here
[03:26.080 --> 03:29.160]  They always say each election is the most important ever
[03:30.160 --> 03:32.160]  This is undoubtedly
[03:32.880 --> 03:35.440]  The second or third most important maybe the first
[03:36.400 --> 03:39.960]  But George Washington the colonies defeating the British
[03:39.960 --> 03:48.440]  George Washington leaving office after two terms and not becoming king as they wanted him to be that was probably the greatest
[03:49.200 --> 03:51.200]  election because we survived
[03:51.640 --> 03:52.800]  infancy
[03:52.800 --> 03:59.160]  But now the Republic was very old and on its deathbed, but nations can rise again like the phoenix
[04:01.240 --> 04:05.560]  Rediscovering the spirit of liberty we could have come from the ashes and we still have a chance
[04:05.560 --> 04:12.400]  But I will tell you scanning mainstream control press they're putting the narrative out that Hillary's going to win now
[04:12.400 --> 04:14.520]  Remember they said he can never get the nomination. They said that
[04:15.720 --> 04:18.360]  He was gonna step down so so they're not all powerful
[04:18.480 --> 04:23.280]  But they're putting out the pre narrative that Trump's gonna lose. I look at the scientific data
[04:24.520 --> 04:29.800]  It shows Trump winning big time taking blue states taking almost all the swing states
[04:29.800 --> 04:35.600]  Roger Stone's plane is landing any minute. He's me with us riding shotgun throughout the day
[04:35.600 --> 04:41.120]  We have a huge broadcast here. This is a 52 hour transmission. We're now 24 hours into it
[04:42.160 --> 04:49.120]  So we're already past the halfway point here roughly and we'll be here right through three o'clock tomorrow and the nightly news tomorrow as well
[04:50.280 --> 04:54.560]  Paul Joseph Watson. I want to put a bookend on this. You just been broadcasting for several hours and a great job
[04:55.080 --> 04:57.480]  What is the essence of what you're seeing right now?
[04:57.480 --> 05:01.320]  Well, I mean a lot of the early anecdotal indications are good Alex
[05:01.320 --> 05:07.600]  You've got you know, Fox News going out to diner in Florida saying who you voting for is 20 to 1 Trump
[05:07.800 --> 05:12.600]  You've got people lining up the block, you know around the block before 7 a.m
[05:13.240 --> 05:21.880]  In droves, you've got CNN reporters saying in Virginia that turnouts are bigger than 2008 not 2012 2008
[05:21.880 --> 05:27.160]  And again, you've got a lot of people wearing red a lot of reports out of Michigan of people wearing red at the polls
[05:27.400 --> 05:30.600]  So again, those indications are good. The problem is
[05:31.160 --> 05:38.440]  In places like Philadelphia now breaking you've got obvious intimidation and vote fraud and this is what I'm going to put an article out on this
[05:38.680 --> 05:43.640]  As soon as I get off air, you've got Trump poll watches being thrown out of
[05:44.280 --> 05:47.240]  Polling places in Philadelphia. You've got
[05:47.240 --> 05:51.480]  Votes, this is just breaking right now
[05:52.040 --> 05:56.200]  Trump poll watches having certificates physically grabbed from them in Philadelphia
[05:57.480 --> 06:03.240]  Machines having calibration issues not registering votes for Trump. We've seen concerns about that
[06:03.240 --> 06:07.960]  And we knew it would be Philadelphia. All the experts have chosen that as the real side of fraud this year
[06:09.480 --> 06:15.000]  Exactly so people being harassed. We've got report which I posted about in Brooklyn
[06:15.000 --> 06:19.000]  You've got a guy wearing a black lives matter shirt intimidating Trump voters
[06:19.240 --> 06:23.560]  So this is already happening in the places where people are being left alone
[06:23.560 --> 06:28.760]  It's the indication is quite good. But again, these people as I said, they don't play by the rules
[06:28.760 --> 06:34.520]  We've seen by the O'Keeffe videos. They're underhanded. They're dirty. They're gonna pull these kind of they admit fraud
[06:34.520 --> 06:37.880]  They admit they're still trying to steal the election. They stole it from Bernie Sanders
[06:38.120 --> 06:44.120]  You're absolutely right. Paul Watson at info wars.com. We hungrily await the latest intel from your dispatch
[06:44.120 --> 06:46.120]  As my friend, please keep it up
[06:46.760 --> 06:51.240]  Okay, thanks Alex. I'm Alex Jones. Get ready. This is the info war
[06:51.800 --> 06:56.600]  We cannot lose as long as we engage the enemy. They're corrupt. We have the high ground

[07:11.880 --> 07:18.120]  Think about this in 24 hours. We will know who the next president of the united states is
[07:18.440 --> 07:21.800]  This is so crazy. This is down to the wire
[07:21.960 --> 07:28.280]  Let's look at some of these headlines that are happening right now on drudge report. Obama encourages illegals to vote
[07:28.520 --> 07:29.720]  stocks go boom
[07:29.720 --> 07:34.840]  High drama and sunshine state election in-game fight final charge through battleground states

[08:06.600 --> 08:08.120]  Something's wrong
[08:08.120 --> 08:11.880]  And we all know it i'm charlotte daniels and i'm here to tell you about it
[08:12.120 --> 08:15.320]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces
[08:15.640 --> 08:18.760]  Bent on global governance when i was a boy
[08:19.160 --> 08:25.080]  It was okay to be proud of the flag heritage mom and apple pie god was in school
[08:25.080 --> 08:29.480]  The reality had a future and beef was for supper

[09:08.840 --> 09:14.040]  It's been something that i've been working on for a long time alex because i think it's very very important
[09:14.040 --> 09:20.440]  And what the aging process is is when the cell replicates we lose a little bit of our telomeres
[09:20.680 --> 09:25.400]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes but when it runs out you start dying
[09:25.560 --> 09:29.720]  We chose the pqq because it has over 175 different clinical trials
[09:29.800 --> 09:34.360]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world. It works like an antioxidant
[09:34.440 --> 09:37.560]  It works to repair nerve growth factor

[11:15.880 --> 11:17.320]  steven krauter
[11:17.320 --> 11:19.880]  Added something to it and I thought we'd open the show
[11:20.840 --> 11:23.640]  The broadcast with something, you know funny and a little bit happy
[11:23.640 --> 11:28.200]  Common ground because this is a very very dark time for this country, but it's also a very very
[11:28.840 --> 11:33.000]  A positive time. It's the best of times worst of times things are always paradoxical in this universe
[11:34.120 --> 11:38.680]  And a lot of horrible things have happened a lot of horrible things are going on a lot of horrible things are coming to light
[11:39.320 --> 11:44.440]  In fact, I'm never pleased when a wiki leak comes out and it proves something horrible
[11:45.240 --> 11:47.240]  That I had been talking about
[11:47.240 --> 11:49.640]  Because 95 of what I talk about I'm sure of
[11:49.640 --> 11:52.840]  And it's already public, but there's that five percent where I
[11:53.640 --> 11:59.800]  Really stare into the abyss and go okay. I think this is the next step of what they're doing and then word for word
[12:02.040 --> 12:06.360]  What I was thinking they were up to is what they're doing and then I realized oh my god
[12:07.560 --> 12:10.040]  I'm inside these people's heads or they're inside mine
[12:10.520 --> 12:16.200]  And I can see the next steps and then every time I'm right. I'm right. I'm like, oh no no no
[12:16.200 --> 12:19.640]  But then I pull back and I wait wait wait a minute
[12:21.000 --> 12:22.600]  I'm not even that smart
[12:22.600 --> 12:25.640]  This is history humans do the same stuff over and over again
[12:26.760 --> 12:31.560]  So I'm just rediscovering what our ancestors have been through over and over again. The problem is
[12:32.120 --> 12:35.400]  There's bio weapons. There's chemical weapons. There's nuclear weapons. There's
[12:36.120 --> 12:39.000]  Seven and a half billion people and let's be honest including myself
[12:39.800 --> 12:42.440]  Very lazy and very stupid. I'm lazy
[12:43.160 --> 12:44.840]  I'm stupid compared to
[12:44.840 --> 12:46.840]  Say my dad's dad
[12:47.000 --> 12:53.800]  Who was a man he could skin a buck run a trot line run a combine fix a combine do electricity
[12:54.360 --> 12:58.520]  Kick somebody's ass if you needed to and be charming and square dance and
[12:59.320 --> 13:01.320]  Play a really good round of golf
[13:03.240 --> 13:06.840]  And be a patriot and a world war two vet and it went on and on today
[13:07.960 --> 13:09.960]  electricity and working I'm like call the handyman
[13:09.960 --> 13:15.480]  And I don't know how to fix it so when I sit here and say we're soft we're dumb
[13:15.560 --> 13:18.120]  Hey, I'm not looking at you like you're down below me
[13:18.840 --> 13:25.160]  And I realize the way to defeat this is farming is ranching is metallurgy is electronics is high tech low tech
[13:25.640 --> 13:28.520]  It's all just becoming human and producing things ourselves
[13:30.840 --> 13:37.320]  When you talk to men or women humans always did this in every culture showing is rhythmic and you zin out
[13:37.320 --> 13:40.520]  and has been proven to lower blood pressure and
[13:41.080 --> 13:46.680]  Uh, most the oldest people in the world. It's just it's it's not just diet. You find these women. So you're like, oh, wow
[13:46.680 --> 13:48.200]  The answer is sowing
[13:48.200 --> 13:54.040]  I'm saying this is what our ancestors did. It's what we've done. It's ingrained in us to even make our own clothes
[13:54.440 --> 13:57.880]  You're like that's stupid. I go to the mall. Did it kind of cool to make your own clothes?
[13:58.840 --> 14:00.840]  See what I'm getting it
[14:00.840 --> 14:08.360]  We're these creatures that make our houses and make our clothes and make art and literature and music and make love and make war
[14:10.600 --> 14:16.760]  Instead we just sit here and are programmed and who are we programmed by drudgerport.com has the article up there who's programming us
[14:17.160 --> 14:19.160]  it's Lady Gaga
[14:19.320 --> 14:25.640]  In a Nazi uniform at a hillary rally and and people are saying what is this? This is horrible. This will blow up in the hillary's face
[14:25.640 --> 14:33.320]  No, it won't. This is the classical projection of power and fascism and as the externalization of the method and was 100%
[14:34.440 --> 14:35.640]  guaranteed
[14:35.640 --> 14:38.760]  To have been authorized at the highest level of her campaign hillary was there
[14:41.320 --> 14:46.120]  Because it's a woman with a fascist hairstyle in a hugo boss, nazi uniform
[14:47.960 --> 14:49.960]  It's a
[14:49.960 --> 14:51.400]  woman
[14:51.400 --> 14:53.400]  in charge the dictator
[14:53.400 --> 14:56.440]  They're telling you we're going to steal this election
[14:58.040 --> 15:01.240]  And the fascistic iconography is everywhere
[15:03.480 --> 15:11.240]  And hillary is saying i'm coming for your guns. I'm coming for your free speech. I'm coming for everything
[15:14.040 --> 15:17.720]  Now they show a photo of michael jackson wearing a more spanish style
[15:17.720 --> 15:25.080]  Imperial uniform from 300 years ago and go oh, but it's okay michael jackson wore a nazi uniform
[15:25.400 --> 15:28.200]  No, that's the spanish or portuguese uniform
[15:29.080 --> 15:31.800]  From 300 years ago. I know look it up. That's what it is
[15:33.080 --> 15:35.080]  It was blue. It'd be french. It was red. It'd be
[15:37.240 --> 15:43.240]  British I mean just it's just the ignorance of the public lady. Gaga is wearing a proto fascist
[15:43.800 --> 15:45.800]  hugo boss style female
[15:45.800 --> 15:50.840]  fascista nazi uniform on tv with hillary clinton
[15:53.880 --> 15:57.400]  That's how dumb they think you are
[16:00.040 --> 16:03.640]  Because people don't have culture they don't have history they don't know where stuff come from
[16:03.960 --> 16:07.560]  They don't know i'm wearing a hundred and fifty year old design of a british classic
[16:08.840 --> 16:10.600]  sports jacket
[16:10.600 --> 16:16.120]  I'm not even into all that stuff, but i have to know what the iconography is because it's all a message
[16:20.440 --> 16:24.440]  All of this when they when they wear these when hillary wears literal
[16:25.560 --> 16:30.200]  Imperial class and i say that because that's what they are. There's a new ruling class communist
[16:31.720 --> 16:33.720]  Outfits at the high level
[16:33.880 --> 16:36.840]  interparty central committee women of china wear
[16:36.840 --> 16:42.200]  At ruling party events man. She's saying I am china's bitch
[16:43.240 --> 16:47.640]  I belong to china and you belong to china. That's why china's so we're going going
[16:47.800 --> 16:53.880]  We're taking over all six hollywood studios. We're taking over tv. We're taking over radio. We're taking over facebook
[16:54.360 --> 16:56.360]  We were meeting with zuckerberg
[16:56.440 --> 16:58.440]  And oh two days later
[16:58.440 --> 17:07.160]  Congress complained and china said we own your debt and laughed at congress and said we own you bitch
[17:07.160 --> 17:13.800]  It's the criminal energy of letting us know they own us. She's wearing Mao Zedong outfits
[17:14.600 --> 17:17.720]  from china silk outfits 1960s scissor
[17:19.240 --> 17:21.240]  Gaga is over here in nazi uniforms
[17:23.480 --> 17:26.600]  This is all about throwing it in our face
[17:26.600 --> 17:33.960]  And notice hillary or a red more fascist style slash chinese outfit, which is the modern style in china
[17:34.760 --> 17:36.760]  And it's the communist chinese red
[17:37.000 --> 17:40.920]  Next to the fascist they are telling you and look at bill clinton looks like he's on another planet
[17:41.240 --> 17:45.960]  That idiot bon jovi's on stage with him, you know hillary has to get all these old has bins
[17:46.680 --> 17:48.680]  To have her rallies and then bruce springsteen
[17:50.680 --> 17:53.080]  I mean give me bruce springsteen is the most empty
[17:53.080 --> 18:00.040]  Just just just just kind of elevator music rock. I mean I hear it. It sounds good. I wouldn't buy an album from bruce springsteen
[18:00.040 --> 18:01.880]  But it's listenable
[18:01.880 --> 18:05.080]  But I mean it's just like oh really now. I hate you forever
[18:05.800 --> 18:08.040]  If I hear you on the radio, it's going off. I mean
[18:09.480 --> 18:13.800]  Can't matt damon can't I just go see your movies without you telling me turn my gun in and you got a bunch of bodyguards
[18:13.800 --> 18:23.240]  You're such hypocrites. I don't want to hate you, but I have to because you want to own me and my family
[18:24.200 --> 18:29.400]  Now some of the images were showing a pretty powerful. She literally wears stuff that doesn't even have buttons on it
[18:30.280 --> 18:32.280]  Just type in hillary clinton wearing
[18:32.280 --> 18:35.800]  Chinese communist garb or hillary clinton wearing malice era garb and it's it's
[18:36.200 --> 18:39.800]  Unbelieveable. Yeah, there you go. That is silk from china
[18:39.800 --> 18:43.080]  An absolute inner-party member uniform
[18:44.600 --> 18:45.560]  Boom
[18:45.560 --> 18:49.720]  I mean it's it's kim jong the only place that's still in style is in north korea with kim jong-un
[18:50.440 --> 18:52.440]  The women in north korea
[18:52.440 --> 18:55.800]  Is the only place they're still wearing 60 style communist outfits
[18:56.680 --> 19:03.160]  And again in hollywood shows dr. Evil dressed like it kim jong-un dresses like it. So does she this is who we're dealing with
[19:03.400 --> 19:05.400]  They're wearing
[19:05.480 --> 19:07.480]  communist and fascist regalia
[19:07.480 --> 19:11.080]  All right, let me give you the big news here
[19:13.240 --> 19:18.600]  Oh, yeah, they've got articles out where trumps leading 32 to 25 in new hampshire in the first polls
[19:19.160 --> 19:21.160]  Uh that are coming out
[19:21.400 --> 19:26.040]  There are lines around the block when people are being canvassed. They're they're mainly saying they're for trough
[19:28.520 --> 19:30.520]  But see nobody needs to show up for hillary
[19:31.480 --> 19:36.040]  Not even buses of illegals and dead people which they're catching all over the country people voting in the name of dead people
[19:36.040 --> 19:38.040]  The arrest are being made from colorado to florida
[19:39.240 --> 19:41.240]  So that stuff that didn't exist of course does exist
[19:43.560 --> 19:48.280]  What they've got is the fraction magic that's on machines and george soros is paramount involved
[19:48.360 --> 19:50.360]  Bev Harris is on tomorrow in the aftermath of this
[19:51.480 --> 19:54.840]  To fractionally go in and carve things up. But here's the deal trumps going to sue
[19:55.720 --> 20:01.320]  He's going to get into the machines. We've already got lawsuits going that are going to make them save the screenshot
[20:01.320 --> 20:03.320]  They do of the real ballot
[20:03.320 --> 20:09.640]  And trumps going to fight and it's the animating contest of the fight is how we win
[20:10.600 --> 20:13.080]  We just give up and roll over
[20:14.280 --> 20:15.480]  They win
[20:15.480 --> 20:19.240]  But we are in the animating contest of liberty think of where we were two years ago. I'm gonna skip the spray
[20:20.120 --> 20:22.120]  Look at that leak documents reveal
[20:22.120 --> 20:27.080]  Expansive soros funding to manipulate federal elections. He doesn't hide it. But yes, it's in new documents
[20:27.080 --> 20:29.560]  That's up on drudgerport.com and info wars.com
[20:29.560 --> 20:35.080]  And then I have a video from a month ago where I said just that and showed the previous document
[20:35.080 --> 20:37.400]  So my video with the article go together nicely
[20:38.440 --> 20:40.440]  from pjmedia
[20:42.840 --> 20:44.840]  So here's what i'm getting at
[20:45.880 --> 20:50.440]  How do you know when coke's coming out or Pepsi's coming out with a new flavor or here
[20:51.160 --> 20:53.400]  How do you know let's say you live in austin, texas or
[20:54.120 --> 20:56.120]  Manhattan, new york
[20:56.120 --> 20:58.120]  how do you know when
[20:58.120 --> 21:00.120]  Taylor Swift's coming to town
[21:01.640 --> 21:03.640]  How do you know
[21:03.640 --> 21:08.760]  Because there'll be billboards for Taylor Swift a month before you're listening to radio. You'll hear Taylor Swift is gonna play at the end, you know
[21:10.440 --> 21:11.880]  Grand Prix
[21:11.880 --> 21:15.480]  M1 racetrack outside austin you almost get sick of it. You hear it so much
[21:17.000 --> 21:20.840]  Now if you're unconscious, you just really don't think hey, she's coming to town. You just think hey, I might want to go see that
[21:21.640 --> 21:22.680]  But that's what i'm getting at
[21:22.680 --> 21:26.840]  You can tell 90% of what they're doing off the pre-programming and they've been doing it
[21:26.840 --> 21:30.280]  He can't win the nomination. Uh, she's gonna win in the landslide
[21:30.760 --> 21:36.360]  Uh on and on and on and on and on latinos don't like trump thinking you're weak minded. Well latinos don't like trump
[21:36.360 --> 21:40.600]  I'm latino. I better vote for for hillary. It's all it's simple mind games
[21:41.560 --> 21:46.040]  But if you're aware of the mind games, it doesn't have any effect on other than irritating
[21:46.360 --> 21:51.000]  Remember the general public a large portion maybe half are still just kind of a la-la-ling
[21:52.280 --> 21:55.320]  They just watch tv and drift around and never really
[21:55.320 --> 22:01.160]  No, just kind of let their lower brain functions. I'm hungry. I want to watch a show. I want to
[22:01.960 --> 22:03.160]  Hey
[22:03.160 --> 22:05.320]  I'm out of it medically. They're in a trance
[22:06.600 --> 22:10.280]  They hear hillary's gonna win hillary's gonna win
[22:11.320 --> 22:13.320]  Trump's not gonna give the nomination
[22:14.120 --> 22:16.120]  No, no
[22:16.520 --> 22:19.160]  And we're like, yes, he is because he's winning all the states. No, he's not
[22:19.960 --> 22:22.600]  Actually, he's winning all these states. No, he's not
[22:22.600 --> 22:28.520]  I've sat there with people that I know well who are educated have degrees and hold down good jobs
[22:29.080 --> 22:32.120]  And they just laugh me up. No way Donald Trump's the nominee alex
[22:32.680 --> 22:38.440]  And I go like what does everyone knows? I mean, oh everyone knows. Oh, I I forgot everyone knows
[22:40.520 --> 22:44.680]  And those very same people are just like alex hillary is going to win no
[22:45.240 --> 22:50.440]  hillary's going to lose but you have to be made to think because everything's still nice
[22:50.440 --> 22:56.120]  And obama cares free and there's no death panels and grippers on tv saying thank god. You're so stupid
[22:56.440 --> 23:03.080]  See, you're in a trance and they think you're stupid and they're laughing at you and just because you're in fantasy island
[23:06.200 --> 23:09.720]  This isn't a fun fantasy island where ricardo autobahn comes along
[23:10.440 --> 23:12.280]  And the midget goes to plan by you
[23:13.320 --> 23:14.360]  No
[23:14.360 --> 23:18.040]  This is not a fun fantasy island. This is a fantasy island with big wars
[23:18.040 --> 23:24.200]  And total surveillance and police states and collapsing economies because the elite want to grind you down
[23:24.360 --> 23:26.840]  They want to destroy you in fact. I want to do this right now
[23:27.560 --> 23:31.080]  Richard Reeves good friend of mine works with info wars as a contractor
[23:32.440 --> 23:36.760]  Works managing info wars team calm. Everybody should pray for him. He's been taking care of his 90 something
[23:36.760 --> 23:38.760]  Her old mother so he hadn't been here full time for a while
[23:38.920 --> 23:41.960]  He's been up in Dallas and he got sick and he sees better now
[23:42.600 --> 23:45.160]  Uh, but uh, he's got like blood poisoning almost killed him
[23:45.160 --> 23:48.520]  And I was talking to him this morning. He got on the hospital recently
[23:50.040 --> 23:53.400]  Well, I was talking to him atre sent me a text and I was driving into work
[23:54.920 --> 23:56.120]  At like 9 a.m
[23:56.760 --> 23:58.760]  And I was thinking about how
[23:58.920 --> 24:02.840]  This is the essence of everything. I was thinking about how trump wants us
[24:03.640 --> 24:06.440]  to be wealthy and productive and successful because
[24:07.240 --> 24:13.320]  He's like the tourist board manager at little beach town, you know, let's say on the east coast that that wants prosperity
[24:13.320 --> 24:16.040]  wants a good economy once folks use the hotels
[24:16.440 --> 24:20.680]  They use the golf courses to use, you know, the restaurants to use what's there
[24:21.320 --> 24:23.320]  So when he sees the economy going under
[24:23.960 --> 24:26.520]  That affects him. He has like the feeling of a farmer
[24:26.920 --> 24:31.000]  That the crops aren't good and the town's not good and and and things aren't doing well
[24:31.400 --> 24:34.680]  That's what renaissance economy is that I harp on all day
[24:35.080 --> 24:39.560]  That's what the american system was supposed to be that we tried for that made us the greatest country on earth
[24:39.560 --> 24:42.520]  Even though we just barely attained 10 percent of it
[24:44.040 --> 24:49.480]  And then there is what you find in all the wiki leaks the nastiness the hatefulness to how do we screw these people over?
[24:49.480 --> 24:52.840]  How do we double down on those folks? Look at these dumb black people. Look at these dumb white people
[24:52.840 --> 24:58.280]  Look at these dumb poor people. Oh, I sure hate them. Thank god. They're so dumb. Oh, let's suppress them. Let's keep them hopeless
[24:58.360 --> 25:00.520]  Let's keep in the dark. These are words they use
[25:01.240 --> 25:03.240]  How many times have I read the wiki leaks?
[25:03.320 --> 25:06.600]  We all agree we want to suppress the public and make them as dumb and poor as possible
[25:06.600 --> 25:13.080]  The problem is they're not submitting. We need to move forward demographic warfare. That's our recommendation. That means total race war
[25:14.520 --> 25:16.520]  divide and conquer
[25:16.520 --> 25:19.320]  The last vestige of an empire trying to control people
[25:20.280 --> 25:22.120]  And you're reading this
[25:22.120 --> 25:26.680]  And then you're around the actual victims of the mind control who are all about peer pressure
[25:26.760 --> 25:29.320]  They don't know they're scared. They got student loans. What are they doing?
[25:29.400 --> 25:30.760]  Everybody just says trumps are racist
[25:30.760 --> 25:36.920]  So they're going to get involved in it and say it over and over again in a group like little huddled chickens in the henhouse
[25:36.920 --> 25:41.640]  Because the weasel told them so or the or the fox told them so and meanwhile they see the fox eating
[25:42.760 --> 25:47.800]  Other chickens, but they just still don't want to admit via Stockholm syndrome. What's happening to them?
[25:49.720 --> 25:53.880]  That's very very very very frustrating. They don't want to believe in themselves
[25:53.880 --> 25:59.560]  They don't want to believe that have trump ended taxes for people making under 40 000 dollars a year. Oh my god
[25:59.560 --> 26:03.000]  The average person making 40 000 a year doesn't really notice what's taken out of their check
[26:03.320 --> 26:06.040]  They're not really filling out their own taxes, but it's like a 30 year check
[26:07.240 --> 26:09.240]  gone
[26:09.240 --> 26:11.720]  That money goes right back to the economy things explode
[26:13.000 --> 26:18.200]  People get out of debt the economy moves forward people go on vacations. They get their hair done. They open more businesses
[26:19.240 --> 26:22.680]  And then 30 tax cuts for people making a hundred thousand two hundred thousand dollars a year
[26:25.320 --> 26:27.320]  I mean, do you know that's that's like
[26:27.320 --> 26:31.160]  That's like sticking everybody's stocking full of 20 30 000 dollars a year or more
[26:32.840 --> 26:36.040]  Let's see they just can't believe that it's got to be Hillary
[26:36.520 --> 26:39.880]  Promises you the free health care and the free education and then their wiki leaks
[26:40.360 --> 26:43.640]  These dumbass kids think I get something free that ain't how this works
[26:45.080 --> 26:50.280]  I had to rob and steal to get where I am. I mean she's in there everywhere. She goes just stealing everything just sticking
[26:50.840 --> 26:52.840]  silverware in her dress
[26:52.840 --> 27:00.600]  Because she's got a will it's hers. The country's hers. It's all hers. I think Donald Trump comes and stays at your house and steals a vase
[27:01.960 --> 27:04.680]  Every diplomatic consulate they go to they put out memos. It's come out
[27:05.400 --> 27:09.800]  When she goes and visits the foreign embassy or whatever like beats the artwork in these vases
[27:10.280 --> 27:15.480]  Hide them. They've been here 200 years. Clinton will steal it in France. They have to hide the things
[27:16.120 --> 27:19.960]  Where people have been going for hundreds of years, you know to diplomat and she'll go and just start going
[27:19.960 --> 27:24.120]  I want this. I want that. I want this. I want that. I mean this is admitted
[27:24.600 --> 27:29.320]  FBI investigations and her robbing consulates our own consulates other consulates
[27:30.200 --> 27:35.720]  He'll have a moving van pull up at a hotel. She wants and just say I'm Hillary Clinton and they'll take a couch out with her
[27:36.360 --> 27:41.640]  She just has warehouses and rotting houses. It's admitted the news all over just like 20-something houses
[27:41.720 --> 27:47.000]  Some of them huge mansions just full of crates of crap crammed in there the witch stole
[27:47.000 --> 27:52.760]  You couldn't get a more bizarre evil person starting wars bragging about it
[27:53.640 --> 27:56.920]  Protecting pedophiles. We always wonder why she always had to protecting pedophiles
[27:59.800 --> 28:06.440]  Because it's about her I want the innocent of the child. I do what I want. That's what stateness has all about me me me me
[28:07.960 --> 28:13.640]  So Richard Reeves as I was thinking about this how they want to make you poor how they want to control you
[28:13.640 --> 28:15.640]  As I was thinking about this
[28:16.520 --> 28:19.480]  I'm driving and being text message and it says
[28:20.200 --> 28:24.120]  What the wicked think of the poor in contrast to what people who are representatives?
[28:26.760 --> 28:31.160]  Of the wicked world a false teaching did not manifest the compassion of God
[28:32.360 --> 28:37.000]  This is why the old testament says the wicked men oppressed the poor Ezekiel 1812
[28:37.640 --> 28:40.280]  Shell the poor Amos 2 6 crush the poor
[28:40.280 --> 28:43.880]  Grind their faces of the poor Isaiah 315 devour the poor
[28:45.000 --> 28:47.000]  Persecute the poor
[28:47.560 --> 28:49.560]  defraud the poor
[28:49.560 --> 28:56.680]  People who are wicked and of the world use the poor abuse the poor step on the poor and want to eliminate the poor and the needy
[28:56.680 --> 28:58.680]  They are just that way
[28:59.240 --> 29:01.240]  Those Richard's final comment
[29:01.240 --> 29:03.240]  And that's it
[29:03.240 --> 29:07.720]  They want you poor and it's in the wiki leaks. It's in the clout and pestle
[29:07.720 --> 29:10.440]  And it's in the wiki leaks. It's in the clout and pebbin
[29:11.640 --> 29:15.640]  They want but then you're like a little lottery ticket person. Oh, please. Oh, if I got Bernie
[29:16.520 --> 29:21.560]  I got Hillary. Please give me something. I oh, oh, they're like, oh really I can buy you for the dollar
[29:23.880 --> 29:26.280]  You're under my thumb. You're under my control
[29:30.200 --> 29:33.640]  And then they steal the nomination from Bernie they try to steal it from trump
[29:33.640 --> 29:42.360]  They it caught the wiki leaks rigging the polls running CNN running ABC running CBS running all of them telling him what questions to ask trump
[29:42.920 --> 29:44.920]  Giving the questions to Hillary
[29:45.080 --> 29:52.280]  Getting caught doing it lying saying they didn't more emails come out. They are forced to admit it. It's all rigged and now you don't think
[29:52.280 --> 29:55.080]  They're gonna try to rig it today. I put a video out this morning
[29:55.080 --> 29:58.760]  While rigging I saw a few comments going oh, you're hedging your bed loser
[29:58.760 --> 30:04.760]  Like I was only tied to trump to feel like I was a winner because I'm a winner if he gets in no the real hard
[30:04.760 --> 30:08.520]  Work starts if he gets in to keep him on us. He'll be attacked from every angle
[30:09.400 --> 30:14.120]  You want to tie a rocket to my butt put Hillary Clinton in but I don't want that because I know she's evil
[30:18.520 --> 30:25.560]  We have tripled our audience in the last month it was double in the last year that it's exponential
[30:25.560 --> 30:29.160]  We're like a hundred and sixty something now on Comcast other big rating services
[30:29.880 --> 30:35.720]  In the world and info wars is one small part 20 something percent of our overall reach
[30:36.840 --> 30:38.840]  We're bigger than anything out there, but drudge
[30:40.360 --> 30:47.720]  Bigger and they all the enemy all knows that do you understand that ladies and gentlemen the enemy knows they're a fraud
[30:48.120 --> 30:52.440]  They're just there trying to con what's left out there. So people don't know it
[30:52.440 --> 30:56.840]  Because people are followers and they look from childhood to the big national TV show

[35:10.120 --> 35:22.120]  Ultimately though, do you think the polls that we've seen over the last week or two going back are wrong because the pollsters are not
[35:22.120 --> 35:28.120]  Factory in in how many Democrats are going to be voting for you? You know all this early voting stuff
[35:28.120 --> 35:36.120]  They say well this many Democrats request a ballot this many Republicans and also just the gigantic number of Republicans who have turned out to
[35:36.120 --> 35:42.120]  See you the enthusiasm level do you think those things the pollsters are getting wrong?
[35:42.120 --> 35:48.120]  I do think a lot of the polls are purposely wrong. I think I can almost tell you by the people that do it the media is very dishonest
[35:48.120 --> 35:54.120]  Extremely dishonest and I think a lot of the polls are phony. I don't even think they interview people
[35:54.120 --> 35:58.120]  I think they just put out phony numbers. I do think this after the debates
[35:58.120 --> 36:04.120]  I think my numbers really started to go up well and then I did a series for the last two weeks only of
[36:04.120 --> 36:14.120]  Really important speeches I think in 20,000 25,000 people 31,000 people were showing up to these speeches you saw yesterday
[36:14.120 --> 36:20.120]  You saw the kind of crowds we're getting and I said something's happening here something incredible is happening here
[36:20.120 --> 36:26.120]  And I'll tell you the enthusiasm and the love in those rooms and those arenas they're really arenas
[36:26.120 --> 36:33.120]  I mean in New Hampshire last night it was a tremendous arena beautiful arena and same thing we had a big convention center last night
[36:33.120 --> 36:41.120]  In Michigan but they're packed I mean if thousands of people we had last night in Michigan we had 10,000 people
[36:41.120 --> 36:50.120]  Outside that couldn't get in 10,000 people it's been amazing so I said something's happening something's really going on
[36:50.120 --> 36:55.120]  You know a lot of people love you because you're not the establishment and you're not the mainstream media
[36:55.120 --> 37:02.120]  Let's talk about what's happening over at CNN first on a Brazil who was a contributor there was giving debate questions to Hillary Clinton
[37:02.120 --> 37:12.120]  Then the DNC was giving questions to Wolf Blitzer CNN was asking them what questions do you want Wolf Blitzer to ask Donald Trump during an interview
[37:12.120 --> 37:18.120]  Now we found out this morning because of WikiLeaks the husband of one of the vice presidents over at CNN
[37:18.120 --> 37:27.120]  His name is Thomas Nides the husband was writing Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman Podesta asking him or saying to him
[37:27.120 --> 37:34.120]  We have a good CNN poll that's coming John, John Podesta writes back I look forward to how that is spun
[37:34.120 --> 37:36.120]  What's your response?
[37:36.120 --> 37:42.120]  Well I think it's terrible it's like I talk about the polls and I understand the business and it's terrible what's going on
[37:42.120 --> 37:49.120]  And I think more terrible than that is the fact that Hillary Clinton through Donald Brazil got the questions to
[37:49.120 --> 37:56.120]  I mean think of it got the questions to the debates I mean three of them now and probably more maybe mine too
[37:56.120 --> 38:01.120]  Although I don't know I again I didn't think she performed particularly well but I will tell you this
[38:01.120 --> 38:08.120]  She got a lot of questions to the debates and you know if you were in West Point and if you got the questions like that
[38:08.120 --> 38:16.120]  They would throw you out of the school if you didn't report yourself she didn't report it she didn't give it to an ethics committee or anybody
[38:16.120 --> 38:20.120]  She took the questions she got the answers to the questions
[38:20.120 --> 38:28.120]  I mean she would have been thrown out of West Point or anapolis or the Air Force Academy and here we have her running for president
[38:28.120 --> 38:32.120]  And Mr. Trump finally I know they're pulling you and you gotta run you gave us time
[38:32.120 --> 38:39.120]  We're looking live now at believe Eric and Laura and Laura are probably you're about to vote for you right here in New York where they live
[38:39.120 --> 38:41.120]  So it's gotta be exciting
[38:41.120 --> 38:46.120]  Guys thanks for correcting me I don't want to be corrected I have to apologize tomorrow
[38:46.120 --> 38:53.120]  There's more of this it's on info wars.com and I thought it was powerful that Fox is actually bringing up some real issues
[38:53.120 --> 38:59.120]  That's why they're better shows obviously Fox and friends that's why Trump goes there but it's it's beyond that it's total collusion with the media
[38:59.120 --> 39:04.120]  They've always lied and said they weren't doing this we know they're doing it when you turn on the three or four networks
[39:04.120 --> 39:12.120]  They have the same story in the same order with the almost exact same words sometimes the exact words they're following a script
[39:12.120 --> 39:19.120]  And it's come out in WikiLeaks that Hillary Clinton the New York Times the Washington Post you name it CNN ABC
[39:19.120 --> 39:26.120]  Well they've got their operatives already most of the host formerly worked for them or the Democratic Party and that's a little tip-off right there
[39:26.120 --> 39:35.120]  And they're sitting there telling them what to do telling them what to say and telling them how to spend polls
[39:35.120 --> 39:43.120]  And of course the poll that they were mentioning there with CNN you know that had you know Hillary ahead or whatever they don't mention in the rest of the WikiLeaks
[39:43.120 --> 39:51.120]  They're saying our plan is over sampling we've got to have them massively over sample that's how from the beginning we'll make it look like she's in the lead
[39:51.120 --> 39:59.120]  John Podesta that's how from the beginning we'll make it appear that she's always in the lead and we'll keep the lead until the end
[39:59.120 --> 40:12.120]  Total fraud do you think those people with George Soros owning machines in 16 states which we have to identify with Bev Harris a Democrat a liberal the top fraud investigator with her other scientists
[40:12.120 --> 40:26.120]  Coming out and certifying the fraction magic program they place on the central tabulators to pre-program the outcome you want and it comes out dead on shaving points
[40:26.120 --> 40:35.120]  It's an algorithm ladies and gentlemen it doesn't care what numbers you put in it will take them and juggle them and carve them down to that number
[40:35.120 --> 40:46.120]  This is more crooked than the worst casino and it Trump understands that Trump's not an idiot and so I'm gonna ask the listeners I'm gonna ask all our guests today
[40:46.120 --> 41:02.120]  What happens now because Trump went from again two three four five six points depending on the battleground state last week even with them in skewed polls over sampling Democrats to four five eight nine ten eleven points
[41:02.120 --> 41:14.120]  I mean he gained three four points in every state and they admit yesterday it was it was compounding we had Roger Stone on last night he was giving us polls before they came out on real clear politics from scientific groups
[41:14.120 --> 41:27.120]  He was dead on because two hours later it came out I was up and it showed all these new polls coming in Trump increasing his lead so with rigged polls over sampling way more Democrats nine twelve fifteen twenty points
[41:27.120 --> 41:36.120]  spending on some of them higher I mean CNN is massively over sampling worse than anybody and they've got them in a dead heat right now
[41:36.120 --> 41:47.120]  But you go to the New York Times at least I checked yesterday it was like a eighty nine percent chance our special editorial board analysis of experts is Hillary Clinton wins
[41:47.120 --> 41:57.120]  Why not say a hundred and fifty percent why not ten thousand percent chance eighty billion chance I mean how about how about Hillary gave birth to the planet and all of us are her children and she's the reason birds sing
[41:57.120 --> 42:07.120]  and in North Korea they teach that the birds sing the sunshine because of Kim Jong-un and his grandfather and his father why not go there
[42:07.120 --> 42:18.120]  Yeah that's their quote scientific polls showing her at forty five point nine him forty two point nine they have another algorithm that's on their front page they churn at people where they're always saying you know she's got a ninety something
[42:18.120 --> 42:29.120]  and eighty something it goes back and forth it's not a poll it's a chances of winning on the New York Times New York Times you know eighty seven percent just just a little come up
[42:29.120 --> 42:39.120]  New York Times chance of Hillary winning number and it's normally at eighty nine ninety ninety one percent I mean it's just made up and then oh there's a scandal she fell down
[42:39.120 --> 42:48.120]  ooh he's got it you know she's got an eighty one percent chance of winning oh she fell down oh it's back up whoa whoa
[42:48.120 --> 42:56.120]  you ask where do you come up with this well they sit there and Carlos Slim and his people just come up with it and it's all a big joke
[42:56.120 --> 43:01.120]  and it's the process of turning us into permanent debt slaves in this country
[43:01.120 --> 43:12.120]  ending the free market showing it up creating a monopoly optimism from Hillary Clinton and darkness from Donald Trump it campaigns in oh my gosh
[43:12.120 --> 43:25.120]  more BS from the New York Times oh optimism a new fresh change a new world the change candidate someone from the outside Hillary Clinton two plus two equals seven
[43:25.120 --> 43:34.120]  Obamacare is free you can keep your doctor black unemployment doubles but we love you we love you
[43:34.120 --> 43:43.120]  Donald Trump's like I will pass tax incentives in minority areas specifically targeting average Americans has conservatives eating out of his hand for reparations
[43:43.120 --> 43:51.120]  and guess what a lot of black folks don't want it because they've been programmed by the media
[43:51.120 --> 44:02.120]  Donald Trump has conservatives eating out of his hand to not be in a war with the LGBT people which is good they won't then all be a bunch of leftist running a bunch of programming
[44:02.120 --> 44:10.120]  we can all just live in peace see he's a peacemaker he's a businessman he's a unifier he's he wants prosperity
[44:10.120 --> 44:20.120]  and we're not allowed to have that because the wicked want to oppress and screw over the poor the wicked want their thumb on you and hey
[44:20.120 --> 44:30.120]  that's why a lot of poor folks are poor because they believe in the system they buy into it and they want to believe their victims and they're never going anywhere
[44:30.120 --> 44:42.120]  and only the mommy Hillary which are like like the like the she-wolf of Rome can give milk to the little New World Order people
[44:42.120 --> 44:50.120]  only place you can get sustenance is from Hillary she lays over on her side and all the little piggies come over and they get milk
[44:50.120 --> 44:53.120]  what a disgusting image
[44:53.120 --> 45:01.120]  meanwhile in all the emails she talks about how much she hates the people and how there's not enough free stuff to go around it's going to collapse everything
[45:01.120 --> 45:09.120]  but that's okay we'll just manage the collapse but it'll happen too quick if we keep doing this so we's poor people they just think they can't have it all free
[45:09.120 --> 45:17.120]  and they can't but you can't sit there and lie to them and tell them how much you love them and how you're going to give them all this free crap
[45:17.120 --> 45:28.120]  so this is a referendum on her lies it is a referendum on the mainstream media but the people have already voted here here's the essence here is the gold standard of all this
[45:28.120 --> 45:33.120]  you can put it the bank you can guarantee it bottom dollar straight shot
[45:33.120 --> 45:42.120]  I mean so true it's ridiculous I should be dancing in the streets celebrating with happiness right now but I caught myself feeling bummed out this morning upset
[45:42.120 --> 45:47.120]  looking at all the headlines seeing them trying to calm the public into accepting a Hillary victory
[45:47.120 --> 45:57.120]  an electoral landslide says top Republican strategist who works for John McCain and John Casey who are the worst of the worst as bad as Hillary
[45:57.120 --> 46:07.120]  establishment insiders oh they said and every headline every headline oh Trump's gonna lose Trump's gonna lose a repudiation of his ideas oh sovereignty
[46:07.120 --> 46:17.120]  and tax cuts and fair trade deals and and and businesses and ingenuity and farming and oh oh
[46:17.120 --> 46:24.120]  it's horrible and peace with Russia and not funding radical Islam and oh he doesn't think you should be made to take vaccines
[46:24.120 --> 46:34.120]  his own son Baron reportedly was damaged by one that's inside baseball but and and and you know what he doesn't think municipality should have to
[46:34.120 --> 46:44.120]  Florida water oh they got a Harvard study on that it's bad for you oh oh and Donald Trump's sons they're the ones that have really radicalized them
[46:44.120 --> 46:57.120]  the government's got files on all this they know about Donald Jr. and what Donald Jr. listens to for 10 years and who dad listens to
[46:57.120 --> 47:05.120]  and so they're crapping their britches and the military talks to the Trumps and they want to make America great again and they know what's happening
[47:05.120 --> 47:15.120]  so here's the deal if a bunch of crooks and scum and Hillary and CNN a shadow of a shadow of a shadow of a shadow of a shadow of a shadow of a shadow of a shadow of themselves
[47:15.120 --> 47:25.120]  a literal already collapsed joke a facade they leave up so people don't understand you know that it's already gone down
[47:25.120 --> 47:32.120]  if they really want to do this and hold on and steal it in front of God country and we're gonna have all the election experts on and more video of them
[47:32.120 --> 47:41.120]  stealing it and more proof and more people arrested and dead people voting and more veritas videos calling us dumbasses and how they're gonna rob us and the media ignoring that
[47:41.120 --> 47:49.120]  and the media wonders my God our ratings drop and drop and drop and drop it's been a dead cat bounce because the election but still again a shadow of itself
[47:49.120 --> 48:00.120]  they wonder why they're so hated why they're so reviled while why they're so absolutely they wonder why everybody hates them
[48:00.120 --> 48:06.120]  because you're detestable people
[48:06.120 --> 48:17.120]  and I love how they double down and put more and more confidence game men and women on CNN and CNBC and MSNBC and Fox is turning into CNN
[48:17.120 --> 48:22.120]  how they sit there in this whole confidence game
[48:22.120 --> 48:27.120]  just looking at you like they're the authority they've got confidence what they're saying is right
[48:27.120 --> 48:31.120]  Obama cares free the government loves you nobody wants your guns we're gonna ban them
[48:31.120 --> 48:39.120]  eGMO take the vaccines it's the law will arrest you we don't know why the kids are all paralyzed just shut up you didn't build your business
[48:39.120 --> 48:50.120]  better clangers Obama was first I'll let them talk they can't even get their own rally when they have to like bust people and spend millions to get them by the rally
[48:50.120 --> 48:57.120]  or bring in some rockstar but now he's like shut him up stop it stop it get out of here
[48:57.120 --> 49:09.120]  because the vet standing up there in a stern focused confident way not not not arrogant telling Obama you're a piece of trash and what Obama didn't like was
[49:09.120 --> 49:19.120]  that fellow was up in the bleachers above him you watch videos about somebody's above Obama basic psychology they're talking down to him he that he doesn't like
[49:19.120 --> 49:28.120]  it he likes the Hillary and Bill they like to sit up there on that stage they just look down on you down there and they're gonna keep you down there
[49:28.120 --> 49:40.120]  if I've had somebody before speaking down to me I feel stronger like I've I've got the uphill battle to go I've got the initiative though I'm gonna win
[49:40.120 --> 49:48.120]  I can't see my crowd to be mean to somebody that's down below me see this is all basic psychology and we don't think about what's going on in our
[49:48.120 --> 49:58.120]  in ourselves so they're able to program us we have to get outside of it and realize they're the most empty sociopathic psychopathic narcissistic empty
[49:58.120 --> 50:08.120]  nobody's who want red carpets and want to be worshiped by Hollywood and want to be involved in all this you know how empty Hollywood is how unhappy the people are their script writers
[50:08.120 --> 50:16.120]  their puppets that somebody else controls but we've been taught by People magazine everything else that we need to just worship it but Hollywood itself's collapsing
[50:16.120 --> 50:24.120]  people don't want it anymore they're leaving it so Hollywood's becoming something for third world countries to produce stuff for you know India and China
[50:24.120 --> 50:34.120]  they're done they're already dead they're already morally bankrupt they're over Donald Trump is just one wave in this awakening and listen
[50:34.120 --> 50:42.120]  I pray justice is done I pray he's elected he is the 45th president of the United States he ran the course he did it all
[50:42.120 --> 50:48.120]  he beat her in rigged poles their lines around the block everywhere for him
[50:48.120 --> 50:56.120]  every Democrat I talked to hates her guts Mark Dice finally has people in LA and San Diego the women all hating her
[50:56.120 --> 51:06.120]  they're coming out of their trance so we're coming out of the trance don't let them bamboozle us and tell us we've been discredited we've been shown to be bad because
[51:06.120 --> 51:18.120]  everything you put up with your message of right wing hate has been repudiated right wing hate that the TPPs run our country or you stole the nomination from Sanders that's not right wing hate that's the truth
[51:18.120 --> 51:28.120]  and leftist go that is actually true that's right it's not left to right folks it's that the so-called left is the main mechanism of the globalist now I'm going to break
[51:28.120 --> 51:40.120]  back and play a bunch of clips I haven't gotten to yet big election news the latest on imminent cyber attack the Russians we have to attack the Russians it's total fraud we got a federalized emergency if Trump wins it means he stole it
[51:40.120 --> 51:50.120]  but meanwhile Trump's completely insane there's no election fraud they're actually in the Associated Press they're all over the news saying that today you've seen it you've heard it
[51:50.120 --> 52:04.120]  we're talking about that too but before we go any further here part of this 52 hour global transmission we're right through tomorrow I want to encourage everyone to be part of the revolution now I'm a little disappointed
[52:04.120 --> 52:24.120]  as of airtime it was only 9 million people that's conservatively on our YouTube and on our Facebook that have watched the live feeds they have to break them up in 4 hours but it's only 9 million on top of the record AMN FM stations and that's 3-4 million a day and all the other videos we've put out that are millions and millions
[52:24.120 --> 52:35.120]  let's add that up conservatively oh my gosh we've only had we've only had about 18 million people that we can meter that tuned in the last 24 hours I'm sorry
[52:35.120 --> 52:48.120]  oh I'm so discredited if Trump loses and you are too drudge is only having something like 100 million visitors a day I was reading and we're only having 18 million oh my ideas are so bankrupt
[52:48.120 --> 52:59.120]  I'm such a nobody I'm such an outcast they have all these articles and mainstream news I'm an outcast and I'm a nobody I'm a failure and drudge is a failure and meanwhile they're all collapsing and have 100,000 viewers
[52:59.120 --> 53:20.120]  you know in the coming election no matter who gets in one of the biggest issues nobody's talking about in the debates or anywhere is the vulnerability of the power grid the potential for power grid chaos EMP cyber warfare onto mentioned dangerous weather hurricanes ice storms all a very real threat to our grid

[55:59.120 --> 56:17.120]  by the way I keep crowing about the numbers at info wars dot com because they're trying to kill the new independent media that is the media they're not the media they're just government and corporate repeaters that have been caught in fraud and organized
[56:17.120 --> 56:32.120]  racketeering crime to defraud us of our elections to steal nominations and to manipulate the political process illegally in this country that's not words when I say they're criminal I mean I'll back it up see me CNN is involved
[56:32.120 --> 56:42.120]  in criminal racketeering with the Democratic Party they've put the Democratic Party people in its CNN and vice versa and are at war with this country
[56:42.120 --> 56:53.120]  that's what Trump explains the media is at war that's not a figure of speech Stephen Bannon comes out and says they're at war with us that's because they are
[56:53.120 --> 57:09.120]  it's not my talking point it's been adopted the media is all top down the heat going Stephen Bannon and the Trump are taking Jones and stuff we tracked it back to Jones eight years ago saying it now they're saying word for word with Jones says it's because it's what it is
[57:09.120 --> 57:23.120]  it's because their boss Alex Jones told them that's not what's happening they're looking at the same thing they're saying the exact same thing Trump can be given speeches and I'll say something while we're speaking and he says the exact same thing next
[57:23.120 --> 57:38.120]  not because he got it from me because it's real folks we didn't write the sheet of music the world did we're reading the same piece of music though you're sitting next to somebody in church reading to him book how are they singing along with me we got the same book folks
[57:38.120 --> 57:46.120]  we're looking at the same thing here
[57:46.120 --> 57:58.120]  America's been taken over by foreign interest they're demoralizing us they're breaking our will right now Trump's bringing our will back I'm bringing our will back you're bringing our will back drudgereport.com is bringing our will back
[57:58.120 --> 58:10.120]  look at drudge top link to us to this show right now because drudge cares about you getting the truth they want to make you cynical where you go everybody's got their version of the truth no this is the truth everybody does and it's
[58:10.120 --> 58:27.120]  Americana it's what made us great we're not inventing something new here okay Hillary Clinton is a freaking witch running around with this jack-o'-lantern smile she doesn't ever wear that I just can't look at anymore in fact we put it back on screen from drudge now they're going to kill me in there the one area I am not successful in is making money
[58:27.120 --> 58:43.120]  people go what do you mean you got 60 something crew members and you're doing all this if we were any other state but Texas we couldn't do this okay because the taxes are a little bit lower I'm not good at making money for the size audience we have we should be making $2 billion a year that's
[58:43.120 --> 58:59.120]  what the industry says okay so it is a David Goliath type deal we don't even make a fraction of that we can barely fund the operation and it's a lot of money we got to bring in $50 million a year or more and I put it in here most talk show hosts as big as I am have a jet have a big mansion I don't have that stuff I don't want it
[58:59.120 --> 59:15.120]  what a mansion is another place for your dog to go go crap in a room you didn't find for a month you know I want a smaller house not a bigger one quite frankly the point is I need to be flooded with capital do you want to really hurt these people look what we've done we're running free shipping
[59:15.120 --> 59:32.120]  we're going to be stored wide and 30 to 40% off everything just go look it up the heirloom seeds the water filtration all the supplements it's just it's ridiculous savings 30% off DNA for 30% off Coitle silver silver bullet restock fund the operation I know our die hard
[59:32.120 --> 59:34.120]  They love the products most people
[59:35.120 --> 59:38.920]  Tell we'll put a YouTube video up that gets 8 million views has an ad on the end of it
[59:38.920 --> 59:45.960]  It'll get 8 million views in two days and I'll go look off the metric and we might get one sale like $10 off of I mean
[59:45.960 --> 59:47.960]  It just shows how
[59:48.120 --> 59:52.400]  Mainstream media is not making money either. It's all a hoax, but it's big corporations. They get taxpayer money
[59:52.400 --> 59:57.320]  They have media as a losing division. They spend billions on trying to capture the country
[59:57.320 --> 1:00:00.200]  But if the media can't deliver the country
[1:00:00.200 --> 1:00:08.640]  To Hillary with all the billions they will be completely shut down. That's why they're so desperate scrabbling lying deceiving begging cheating to get
[1:00:09.520 --> 1:00:12.880]  Their next paycheck. Oh, but they won't try to steal the election
[1:00:12.880 --> 1:00:16.320]  They've just been caught rigging everything else and Trump's crazy because he said the sky was blue

[1:01:52.640 --> 1:01:54.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:02:03.720 --> 1:02:05.720]  The answer to 1984
[1:02:06.520 --> 1:02:08.520]  The answer to
[1:02:08.520 --> 1:02:15.000]  1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:02:15.640 --> 1:02:17.280]  I tell you
[1:02:17.280 --> 1:02:24.020]  I see you want to be historians and people that understand the deeper meanings of the world and the waters in which we stare
[1:02:25.520 --> 1:02:27.120]  The ether
[1:02:27.120 --> 1:02:32.040]  They say oh 1776 that's the Illuminati founded in Engelstad University
[1:02:33.960 --> 1:02:36.360]  In Ravaria by Adam Weiss hop
[1:02:36.360 --> 1:02:41.720]  Alex Jones programming us with the Illuminati
[1:02:44.840 --> 1:02:52.800]  The Illuminati was created as a counterfeit to operations launched a decade before in the United States by the real Illuminati
[1:02:55.840 --> 1:03:02.200]  And I'm not even saying the real Illuminati was overall good, but it just meant illuminate bring light into the world
[1:03:02.240 --> 1:03:04.240]  They believe they were esoteric
[1:03:04.240 --> 1:03:06.240]  Christians
[1:03:07.440 --> 1:03:08.920]  And
[1:03:08.920 --> 1:03:14.400]  Not hidden as in the occult on purpose but hidden because they were persecuted the new Atlantis
[1:03:15.320 --> 1:03:18.840]  But people don't even know where they're coming from or who they are
[1:03:18.920 --> 1:03:23.520]  They're a counterfeit just like Gary Johnson's a counterfeit libertarian sent to stop Trump
[1:03:25.040 --> 1:03:27.600]  Is Trump perfect? No, he's imperfect in many ways
[1:03:27.600 --> 1:03:34.960]  But it's his imperfection that makes him so perfect against the enemy because he literally cannot be intimidated cannot be bought
[1:03:35.120 --> 1:03:38.180]  Cannot be pushed around it has a giant bull like
[1:03:38.880 --> 1:03:40.200]  doggedness
[1:03:40.200 --> 1:03:42.200]  the guy is a bull a
[1:03:42.920 --> 1:03:44.920]  bull a
[1:03:46.560 --> 1:03:48.560]  Bull full of stamina
[1:03:50.600 --> 1:03:52.560]  Contrast that to the stuttering crazy
[1:03:52.560 --> 1:03:57.720]  I mean Bill Clinton literally chewing on his tongue and la la landing now we can show some of that video without audio
[1:03:57.720 --> 1:04:02.360]  There's no point without the audio it chewing honest. I mean he's doing mental patient stuff her and
[1:04:04.160 --> 1:04:05.880]  Hillary
[1:04:05.880 --> 1:04:07.880]  Hillary and him constantly
[1:04:08.680 --> 1:04:10.680]  Or whack jobbing out
[1:04:11.880 --> 1:04:13.880]  These are mental patients
[1:04:14.640 --> 1:04:16.760]  It's all a big joke to them
[1:04:16.760 --> 1:04:21.760]  They're on drugs constantly and
[1:04:22.680 --> 1:04:29.160]  All they've got to the power they're holding on to to defend themselves and protect themselves and their criminal enterprises and the horrible
[1:04:29.680 --> 1:04:32.000]  Trader media the dishonest
[1:04:33.120 --> 1:04:35.120]  discredited sad
[1:04:35.120 --> 1:04:37.120]  loathsome embarrassing
[1:04:37.560 --> 1:04:38.600]  sickening
[1:04:38.600 --> 1:04:39.800]  fetid
[1:04:39.800 --> 1:04:41.400]  hateful
[1:04:41.400 --> 1:04:43.520]  Confederates that they have working for them
[1:04:43.960 --> 1:04:45.960]  Who are gone?
[1:04:45.960 --> 1:04:47.960]  They're over
[1:04:48.160 --> 1:04:50.160]  They are things of the past
[1:04:51.880 --> 1:04:58.940]  You ask why CNN everybody have gotten red and MSNBC everybody have just even info babes would give them ratings or or just real reporters
[1:05:00.200 --> 1:05:03.040]  Because a real reporter a man that comes off as strong whenever you know
[1:05:03.040 --> 1:05:08.400]  I'd be some liberal, but then he'd be against the war and against the stuff they were doing they can't even get a damn rather these days
[1:05:10.120 --> 1:05:14.480]  They just have a bunch of known politicos from the Democratic Party
[1:05:14.480 --> 1:05:16.480]  working for them and
[1:05:18.400 --> 1:05:24.840]  They don't think we don't see it already and now we have the WikiLeaks and oh, here's the big one
[1:05:25.360 --> 1:05:31.600]  It's all big, but this is really big WikiLeaks says they're gonna keep releasing stuff right through the year and right now into next year
[1:05:31.600 --> 1:05:34.480]  It's not gonna stop and there was a lot of stuff in there
[1:05:34.480 --> 1:05:38.720]  So horrible that WikiLeaks has some pro government people that who believe it could be used for good
[1:05:40.200 --> 1:05:42.360]  That they didn't want to have to bring all this out plus
[1:05:42.360 --> 1:05:45.800]  This is dangerous stuff. I mean the globals to try to kill them
[1:05:46.520 --> 1:05:51.320]  But now they have nothing to lose and there's kind of a death battle stare in Assange's eyes now
[1:05:51.600 --> 1:05:54.560]  I can tell he has been changed by all this and his
[1:05:57.400 --> 1:06:03.960]  Really doesn't amazing things like I'm embarrassed. I've attacked him saying release more stuff in my my rage because he really is a
[1:06:04.560 --> 1:06:06.560]  hero
[1:06:06.960 --> 1:06:09.680]  I mean who is the man of the year and it's not about the credit
[1:06:09.680 --> 1:06:16.200]  The man of the year really should be Donald Trump. It was Putin last year. We're saying no the globals. It is it is all from
[1:06:17.240 --> 1:06:21.000]  But if you had to say like, you know, who are the five men of the year?
[1:06:22.040 --> 1:06:24.040]  It had to be Nigel Farage
[1:06:25.080 --> 1:06:27.080]  It had to be
[1:06:27.760 --> 1:06:29.760]  The folks at WikiLeaks
[1:06:31.840 --> 1:06:33.840]  It would have to be people like Matt Drudge
[1:06:36.200 --> 1:06:38.200]  It's all those folks
[1:06:38.200 --> 1:06:45.400]  James don't keep everybody but really it's just the people it's the real press and the real resistance and just common sense
[1:06:45.400 --> 1:06:47.400]  Like coming up out of the water to get air
[1:06:48.160 --> 1:06:50.840]  Coming to the service and getting that delicious air in our lungs
[1:06:51.400 --> 1:06:55.840]  Sitting back and realizing this is a purging. We're going through like vomiting poison out and
[1:06:56.640 --> 1:06:59.240]  Trump is just one wretch as we try to get it out
[1:06:59.760 --> 1:07:04.560]  Hillary Clinton wins the election. She has defeated the fear and hate-based
[1:07:04.560 --> 1:07:11.640]  Conservative Donald Trump. Well, that's according to Newsweek who reportedly has already issued a special
[1:07:11.760 --> 1:07:17.720]  Commemorative edition with Hillary on the cover behind the words Madame President Hillary Clinton's
[1:07:18.040 --> 1:07:25.240]  Historic journey to the White House. They know something. We don't feasty clothes line reports that the fix is in Newsweek
[1:07:25.240 --> 1:07:30.240]  Already has an issue in print boxed and ready to ship declaring Hillary the winner
[1:07:30.240 --> 1:07:36.800]  But others think the whole thing might be a hoax Newsweek has been asked repeatedly whether the magazine is real
[1:07:36.800 --> 1:07:41.120]  But has failed to respond so far if the issue is indeed a fake
[1:07:41.120 --> 1:07:47.440]  Well, it's very convincing the one thing we know for sure is that Newsweek will not be publishing a special
[1:07:47.600 --> 1:07:54.920]  Commemorative edition that is favorable to Donald Trump if he wins you can learn more right now at info wars dot com
[1:07:54.920 --> 1:07:56.920]  You

[1:10:13.720 --> 1:10:21.440]  U.S. sovereignty, but national sovereignty and human sovereignty against the scientific dictatorship of the New World Order and
[1:10:21.680 --> 1:10:28.560]  Donald Trump is our figurehead in the fight for Americanism not globalism. It's now election day
[1:10:29.120 --> 1:10:31.120]  Tuesday November 8th

[1:10:51.440 --> 1:10:53.440]  2016 hard to believe we're here
[1:10:54.440 --> 1:10:56.440]  But we're now into our what
[1:10:57.320 --> 1:11:01.600]  She got 24 hours and another hour. We're into hour 25 26
[1:11:01.600 --> 1:11:06.520]  We're gonna be here for at least 52 hours right through tomorrow
[1:11:07.280 --> 1:11:10.920]  At 3 o'clock, and we're back at night info wars nightly news
[1:11:12.240 --> 1:11:17.600]  If Trump wins somehow able to stop the fraud stop the machine stop the fake polls
[1:11:18.040 --> 1:11:24.760]  Then we know Soros has already prepared and activated and the media said the proper the Newsweek said it's time to riot
[1:11:25.600 --> 1:11:27.600]  Time magazine has said it's time to go out
[1:11:27.600 --> 1:11:32.040]  They've got the college trained Soros people going and saying deck the halls with dead cops
[1:11:33.360 --> 1:11:35.360]  We're looking at that
[1:11:35.400 --> 1:11:37.400]  But if they steal it from Trump
[1:11:37.560 --> 1:11:43.920]  Will they false flag to further demonize the quote alt-right that Hillary says must be banned must be repudiated
[1:11:44.440 --> 1:11:47.280]  Which is just the return of nationalism and common sense
[1:11:47.280 --> 1:11:50.400]  They call that the alt-right and then we use her definitions because she's gone
[1:11:51.960 --> 1:11:53.520]  See how that works
[1:11:53.520 --> 1:11:59.240]  Their reality Obamacare is free. It isn't we're the alt-right. We're not they call us that we're just patriots
[1:12:01.120 --> 1:12:02.720]  They tell you the Tea Party's racist
[1:12:02.720 --> 1:12:04.600]  So if you're have melanin in your skin
[1:12:04.600 --> 1:12:09.160]  You don't feel like you're able to own a gun or a private property because you're not part of that racist club that has that
[1:12:09.400 --> 1:12:11.400]  They know how to trick you into being a slave
[1:12:12.400 --> 1:12:18.280]  Now coming up we're also gonna talk about the fact that Homeland Security says that Russian hack attacks are imminent
[1:12:18.280 --> 1:12:22.320]  They've been involved with no evidence. They say they don't say what you intelligence chief is saying
[1:12:22.320 --> 1:12:25.240]  This is just from the Democrats and that Trump's working with them
[1:12:25.240 --> 1:12:29.400]  So if Trump wins he stole it and they may have to you know contest it
[1:12:30.200 --> 1:12:34.960]  But the worst thing you can do is contest an election if Trump thinks there's a fraud it doesn't exist
[1:12:34.960 --> 1:12:41.520]  He's insane, but the Russians are involved if he wins. We've got a contested and so Homeland Security is on standby
[1:12:41.520 --> 1:12:43.640]  They've got the organization of
[1:12:43.640 --> 1:12:52.760]  The OECD and its protective unit intelligence unit super secret of organization that set up the modern Europe
[1:12:53.200 --> 1:12:58.320]  With this organization of a security partnership overseeing things for us
[1:12:58.320 --> 1:13:02.520]  I mean this is an incredible time and the Communist Chinese that own the majority of our debt
[1:13:02.560 --> 1:13:05.120]  They're buying up all six of the Hollywood
[1:13:05.560 --> 1:13:08.240]  Studios and telling us set out and shut up
[1:13:08.240 --> 1:13:13.520]  We'll tell you what you can say what you can do and they censored Michael Savage's last book where it wasn't even allowed to be sold
[1:13:13.520 --> 1:13:14.760]  in stores
[1:13:14.760 --> 1:13:17.040]  Not the one about scorched earth one before about the Chinese
[1:13:18.560 --> 1:13:23.360]  We have the OSCE boost number monitoring US election. There it is CNN and
[1:13:23.920 --> 1:13:27.560]  The UN's there overseeing with the EU Donald Trump voting
[1:13:28.920 --> 1:13:31.520]  Well, thank God they're watching that risky agent
[1:13:33.640 --> 1:13:39.920]  We've got impartial election observer tweets support for Hillary now I want to get our next guest on for a full hour tomorrow
[1:13:39.920 --> 1:13:45.280]  Because there's so much to cover we have Ron Paul coming up at the bottom of the hour former congressman Gerald Salente
[1:13:45.960 --> 1:13:51.200]  Leanne McAdoo, we've got everybody from Mark Dice to you name it coming on in the next 24 hours
[1:13:51.360 --> 1:13:53.360]  There's a list at info wars.com
[1:13:54.320 --> 1:13:57.720]  Forward slash show or info wars.com forward slash election
[1:13:57.720 --> 1:14:03.440]  That has the same video and audio feeds and podcasts and free droid apps and info wars apps and things like that
[1:14:03.720 --> 1:14:07.440]  But the election area will also have numbers and more as they come out this evening
[1:14:07.440 --> 1:14:13.280]  But watch for early projections. That's when the steel comes in and we see the media pre-preparing this right now
[1:14:15.360 --> 1:14:22.560]  So we've got a lot of big guests coming up that you definitely do not want to miss from John Rappaport to Dinesh D'Souza
[1:14:23.480 --> 1:14:25.480]  To Wayne Madsen Lionel
[1:14:25.520 --> 1:14:30.160]  Bev Harris Gavin McEnnis dr. Steve Pacinac and so many more
[1:14:31.840 --> 1:14:33.840]  But joining us just until the bottom of the hour
[1:14:33.840 --> 1:14:39.520]  Is Matt Bracken enemies foreign and domestic commies author researcher former Navy SEAL?
[1:14:40.200 --> 1:14:41.240]  and
[1:14:41.240 --> 1:14:45.600]  Really has predicted and as a great source a lot of what we're facing what we're dealing with
[1:14:46.440 --> 1:14:51.200]  We have foreign banks openly running the media openly at war with the people but they have no credibility
[1:14:51.440 --> 1:14:55.160]  So we've reached this paradox where the people are awake where info wars
[1:14:55.560 --> 1:15:01.520]  Has been as big as a lot of these channels for a while, but now with the election. We're way bigger than CNN
[1:15:01.520 --> 1:15:05.400]  That's admitted even the Washington Post way bigger than them. I mean, they're freaking out folks
[1:15:05.920 --> 1:15:09.160]  18 million as of this morning since we started yesterday
[1:15:10.240 --> 1:15:16.760]  If you count up the six seven eight million on one Facebook and three million more on another Facebook and four five million on YouTube
[1:15:16.760 --> 1:15:21.560]  And then our own feeds and that just videos people are watching not audio feeds not radio stations
[1:15:21.560 --> 1:15:26.160]  Not not the three or four million that always tuned in took me 20 years to get that many listeners now
[1:15:26.480 --> 1:15:28.920]  It's not the million or two visitors info wars gets every day
[1:15:28.920 --> 1:15:34.520]  Now it's it's just exponential and it's not going to go away for the election
[1:15:34.520 --> 1:15:36.320]  That's why they have to try to shut us down
[1:15:36.320 --> 1:15:41.240]  But shut down something that's so popular and again info wars is big
[1:15:41.240 --> 1:15:48.800]  But overall is a small part of the thousands of sites and thousands of people of every race color and creed just to the US alone speaking up
[1:15:49.200 --> 1:15:54.600]  Then Matt drudge overall traffic and being able to put topics out there bigger than info wars
[1:15:54.600 --> 1:16:02.120]  Trudgereport.com this is our media. This is our victory. This is how we've done this. They may steal the election
[1:16:03.360 --> 1:16:05.360]  But it's a period victory
[1:16:05.440 --> 1:16:08.840]  And I'm not preparing you for a loss Trump has won
[1:16:09.240 --> 1:16:15.640]  Trump is dominating in every major even skewed pole in battleground states the insiders man. They are panicking
[1:16:16.920 --> 1:16:21.040]  But can they rip him off? Well, he's going to challenge it like he did the primaries
[1:16:21.040 --> 1:16:25.120]  Well, they said we don't care if you got double everybody else. We're not giving it to you. He said, okay
[1:16:25.120 --> 1:16:28.800]  I'm gonna sue he began the lawsuits. They had to back off. He will fight for it
[1:16:28.800 --> 1:16:33.200]  So to go over this calculus Matt Bracken joins us the next 15 minutes and again
[1:16:33.200 --> 1:16:36.520]  I want to get you back up for a full hour this week to break down the aftermath
[1:16:36.520 --> 1:16:38.920]  But I want to get just a prelude of what you're seeing right now
[1:16:40.480 --> 1:16:46.960]  Well, it really is I always go back to this it really is a battle for our minds and the media is the you know
[1:16:46.960 --> 1:16:54.800]  The overt above-the-surface part of this battle clearly the the new media alt media is winning
[1:16:54.800 --> 1:16:59.600]  But something to be careful of next year, especially if Hillary wins
[1:16:59.880 --> 1:17:04.880]  You know, the reason that Obama gave the keys to the internet away to the UN is so that
[1:17:05.800 --> 1:17:08.720]  Regardless of our first amendment or what the Supreme Court says
[1:17:09.040 --> 1:17:14.080]  The UN is going to be in a position to pull the plug on your show as a hate as a hate
[1:17:14.080 --> 1:17:19.160]  And they're gonna start a big war to sell that I don't in fact the the the new soros emails actually say that
[1:17:19.360 --> 1:17:25.560]  They said we're gonna shut the alt right down next year with the UN. That's official. Yeah, they need to do that
[1:17:25.560 --> 1:17:30.880]  The game plan is then as the whaler what you know shaves won an election the first time
[1:17:31.320 --> 1:17:34.040]  After that he started stuffing the judiciary
[1:17:34.480 --> 1:17:40.840]  adding members to Congress so that he could pass his own laws and then they went after the heads of the of the
[1:17:40.840 --> 1:17:48.360]  Conservative opposition media some of them were arrested for bogus and like embezzlement type of charges sex charges
[1:17:49.080 --> 1:17:55.560]  And but one by one they picked off all of the opposition media until there was no opposition media left in Venezuela
[1:17:55.560 --> 1:18:02.560]  That's right. So we're literally about to see the fall of the Republic into absolute despotism. I mean, this is so huge
[1:18:03.120 --> 1:18:05.400]  But this but the thing is that's different here
[1:18:05.400 --> 1:18:11.520]  And I write about this in some of my short stories like what I saw at the coup if next year for example
[1:18:11.520 --> 1:18:13.800]  The only media left is like you know CNN
[1:18:14.240 --> 1:18:21.840]  Then the talking heads the lying talking heads on CNN are going to be just enemy targets to the freedom lovers
[1:18:21.840 --> 1:18:24.760]  That aren't just going to quietly knuckle under and that's right
[1:18:25.960 --> 1:18:31.360]  It's not me just people yelling you're a traitor your scum. It's gonna be no financial support pure hatred
[1:18:31.360 --> 1:18:35.400]  They will be seen as the actual occupying army. They are that's right
[1:18:35.400 --> 1:18:39.040]  And then they can live in a gated community and they can send their servants out for food
[1:18:39.040 --> 1:18:41.040]  But it's not going to be much of a life
[1:18:41.040 --> 1:18:45.960]  Especially when they have to move on to military bases because they won't even be safe on military bases
[1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:48.600]  Let's they get rid of the military and that's going to be hard to do
[1:18:50.160 --> 1:18:55.320]  We're not shooting our mouths off you studied history explain this to them what they've signed on to they've signed on to actually
[1:18:55.320 --> 1:19:00.640]  Occupy the US and when you start arresting the patriot leaders the gloves come off dumbasses
[1:19:01.240 --> 1:19:06.440]  Right when this for example when sites like Breitbart Drudge and Info Wars when these sites go down
[1:19:06.600 --> 1:19:12.000]  That'll be a declaration of war that will be for our Fort Sumter moment. There's no question about it
[1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:15.200]  There's a reason why people are taking all these tactical courses
[1:19:15.240 --> 1:19:20.040]  There's a reason why AR-15s and bigger weapons are flying off the shelves
[1:19:20.040 --> 1:19:26.680]  You know, there's a reason why people that are never going to hunt and elk in their life by a 338 lapua that can fire
[1:19:26.680 --> 1:19:29.240]  You know a round that'll hit past a thousand yards
[1:19:29.360 --> 1:19:34.240]  You know that there's a reason and it's not for a hunt an Eastern whitetail deer believe me
[1:19:35.040 --> 1:19:38.800]  In fact, they say the all-time records of two years ago have been broken again
[1:19:39.440 --> 1:19:42.040]  Millions of firearms a month pouring off shelves
[1:19:42.040 --> 1:19:49.400]  Right, this is preparation for a potential civil war. In fact, we're already in the civil war the the doctors Steve
[1:19:50.200 --> 1:19:51.680]  What's it?
[1:19:51.680 --> 1:19:55.960]  Pigeon? How do you pronounce the name? Pigeon. It's it's a hard C. Pigeonic. Pigeonic
[1:19:56.360 --> 1:20:00.240]  Yeah, what I what the way that I look at it since watching his coup videos
[1:20:00.720 --> 1:20:03.040]  And seeing him on up in other media
[1:20:03.600 --> 1:20:06.280]  What we're looking at below the surface
[1:20:06.280 --> 1:20:13.840]  It's sort of like a blackwater swamp or creek and every once in a while you see a shark fin or an alligator tail splash out of the water
[1:20:14.400 --> 1:20:16.920]  Underneath the surface. There is already a
[1:20:18.080 --> 1:20:21.960]  Brutal civil war being fought. It's being fought by the rank-and-file
[1:20:22.360 --> 1:20:29.680]  Honorable FBI special agents the ones who believe their oath that do believe in in a fidelity bravery and integrity
[1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:35.440]  Against the stooges and goons like Comey. I'd like to mention in a little time here
[1:20:35.440 --> 1:20:41.840]  People need to not just take these these stooges at face value. Comey is a bought and paid for
[1:20:42.480 --> 1:20:47.800]  Political hatchet man. He alternated his his career like Loretta Lynch his career
[1:20:48.040 --> 1:20:53.840]  Alternated between being a US attorney and then getting these plum jobs. You just happen to get a job
[1:20:53.840 --> 1:21:01.760]  It's not a bribe because you had a job where you're the the chief counsel of the world's biggest hedge fund or you're the chief counsel of
[1:21:01.760 --> 1:21:08.080]  Lockheed Martin and you're paid tens of millions of dollars to go along and get along and be a team player
[1:21:08.240 --> 1:21:14.920]  Then they rotate you up to being a US attorney or the head of the FBI and they've already bought you
[1:21:15.040 --> 1:21:19.600]  There's no question in my mind a guy like Comey that lives in a three million dollar house
[1:21:19.600 --> 1:21:24.160]  You know, he's a federal civil servant that lives in a three million dollar house
[1:21:24.320 --> 1:21:29.040]  Who's worth tens of millions in payola from his you know corporate gigs
[1:21:29.040 --> 1:21:34.520]  So when they rotate him up to be ahead of the FBI, he's not going to rock the boat. There's no doubt
[1:21:34.520 --> 1:21:38.560]  He's somewhere in his past. He's probably done some shady dealings
[1:21:38.960 --> 1:21:41.040]  Then and this is how they control people
[1:21:41.040 --> 1:21:46.040]  They don't let anybody get near these power positions like attorney general and ahead of the FBI
[1:21:46.640 --> 1:21:49.900]  Unless they can control them unless they know there's some
[1:21:50.440 --> 1:21:56.440]  Shady dealings with the Swiss bank accounts with the Swiss banks that they can always pull out and ruin these men
[1:21:56.440 --> 1:22:00.200]  I agree. Matt Bracken Matt Bracken enemies foreign and domestic calm
[1:22:00.840 --> 1:22:05.960]  It is undoubted. There is a quiet internal civil war. The globalists openly around the country
[1:22:05.960 --> 1:22:12.320]  We're openly under TPP and foreign deals world government submitted the criminality's never been more naked. So when I say Pyrrhic victory
[1:22:12.720 --> 1:22:15.480]  You know when the battle lose the war clearly
[1:22:15.760 --> 1:22:22.040]  They must go to total totalitarianism now suppress the press and everything that's that's their only hope and they're showing
[1:22:22.040 --> 1:22:25.120]  They're willing to steal. They're willing to kill. They're willing to engage in crimes
[1:22:25.120 --> 1:22:29.680]  They're willing to take money from foreign governments. I mean this on a metric is the most corrupt
[1:22:29.880 --> 1:22:35.280]  Undoubtedly, we've ever seen probably in world history anywhere with because there's so much transparency because the way and you
[1:22:35.840 --> 1:22:38.040]  So we have we have Hillary Clinton
[1:22:38.040 --> 1:22:43.960]  She the Clinton crime family has made at least a hundred and fifty million dollars personal money
[1:22:44.240 --> 1:22:47.480]  From no visible means of support no honest income
[1:22:47.720 --> 1:22:52.960]  Yet the FBI and the DOJ are just in the actively engaged in a cover by the way
[1:22:52.960 --> 1:22:55.080]  That's what we know of there's billions of Portland, Swiss
[1:22:56.280 --> 1:22:57.800]  So here's my question
[1:22:57.800 --> 1:23:02.640]  Setting that up what comes out of this because it seems like real momentum on the ground
[1:23:03.040 --> 1:23:08.400]  We're 10 to 1 kick on their butt, but they've got all the control positions. So like you said, they're already
[1:23:08.960 --> 1:23:13.840]  Figuratively but now literally moving into their armored redoubt. Most of the big billionaires are leaving Israel
[1:23:14.360 --> 1:23:20.400]  They're leaving the US are leaving other areas and going to New Zealand and other armored fortresses as if it's the end of the world
[1:23:20.400 --> 1:23:25.400]  So I see their retreat as a symbol of just how weak they are
[1:23:25.680 --> 1:23:29.600]  Well, they're they're weak, but this is like a cornered weasel
[1:23:30.120 --> 1:23:34.440]  They're very dangerous, you know try to pull that weasel out of his corner back in the cage
[1:23:34.440 --> 1:23:35.880]  You're gonna get bitten
[1:23:35.880 --> 1:23:42.000]  These guys are primarily atheists that are just power hungry, you know power mad people like George Soros
[1:23:42.360 --> 1:23:48.280]  George Soros doesn't have a dynasty to fall back on there's no Jordan the George Soros son
[1:23:48.280 --> 1:23:54.360]  Who's like a 20 or 5 year old playboy, you know a waste roll. There's no George Soros to come
[1:23:54.360 --> 1:23:57.520]  I was about to say he is a waste roll. He looks like a lobotomized
[1:23:58.040 --> 1:24:04.480]  And but George when George Soros dies as far as he's concerned the universe ends because he's though
[1:24:04.480 --> 1:24:06.480]  He's like megalomaniac of the age
[1:24:07.880 --> 1:24:15.920]  Clinton the both Clintons and Obama they're sort of like junior George Soros is but their entire identity is wrapped up in themselves
[1:24:15.920 --> 1:24:19.960]  They will take but they will burn the whole building down if they see themselves
[1:24:20.440 --> 1:24:27.520]  About to go to and that's what's moved the Russians and others into an apocalyptic stance right now and our own FBI says quote literally
[1:24:27.920 --> 1:24:32.960]  She's the antichrist people say, what do you mean? They go she acts like Linda Blair? I was told that they are
[1:24:34.160 --> 1:24:39.400]  And people said oh, he's making that up now. They're in the Guardian saying no she acts like Linda Blair
[1:24:39.760 --> 1:24:41.760]  And thanks to WikiLeaks
[1:24:41.760 --> 1:24:46.640]  The you know, we know now know about this the satanic rituals the you know the
[1:24:47.200 --> 1:24:53.480]  Finger-cutting and all the bodily fluids and these you know these satanic rituals these people are very
[1:24:53.880 --> 1:24:59.600]  Diabolical at the top and if they are if if if Trump wins by say a landslide
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:03.760]  Indisputable just for example, and they have to be prepared for that
[1:25:03.760 --> 1:25:08.000]  There's no way they can they can finagle that was my next question. What are the scenarios you see?
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:13.040]  Let's walk through them. Well, if they face prison, they face print dying in prison. They're not young
[1:25:13.560 --> 1:25:19.320]  The Clinton face dying in prison. They will do anything and I think that what they'll do is false flag attacks
[1:25:19.320 --> 1:25:24.860]  But we're very fortunate. I compare this to World War two Europe in 1945
[1:25:25.520 --> 1:25:28.500]  Imagine you're a German Panzer Division commander
[1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:37.120]  The allies have got the United States Air Force doing daylight strategic bombing the British are doing nighttime area city bombing
[1:25:37.120 --> 1:25:44.840]  P-51 mustangs and bands are roaming up and down the rail or railroads tearing everything up with rockets and 50 calibers
[1:25:44.920 --> 1:25:50.800]  There's nowhere you can move without being fired at so we are in a for the first time
[1:25:50.800 --> 1:25:57.600]  We have an actual counter attack like a counter coup going on with project Veritas O'Keefe
[1:25:57.600 --> 1:26:03.440]  He's like the P-51 mustangs rocketing the rails. You've got the you've got judicial watch
[1:26:03.440 --> 1:26:07.260]  Slow methodical war in the trenches with the FOIA act
[1:26:07.560 --> 1:26:12.200]  Then you've got that you're dragging important documents out and you've got wiki leaks
[1:26:12.280 --> 1:26:15.800]  So we're exposing them and when they're exposed they can't move
[1:26:15.800 --> 1:26:19.600]  I was about to say Julian Assange is like the B-17s bombing
[1:26:19.920 --> 1:26:26.360]  Yes, and and and people like the whoever the wiki leakers are I happen to think they're inside the FBI
[1:26:26.360 --> 1:26:29.080]  I happen to think that they're actual honorable
[1:26:29.080 --> 1:26:33.640]  Well, that's actually now known. I mean that was leaked about six months ago about Benny, but it's now confirmed
[1:26:33.880 --> 1:26:40.040]  But but for for the first time that I could remember in the last two weeks of a really critical election
[1:26:40.040 --> 1:26:49.040]  We have some weapons. So the Bob Kramer types are the ones that would be organizing the the false flag attacks
[1:26:49.200 --> 1:26:54.320]  You know, he's the dirty tricks man. He's the wet ops man. Well, he's got his head down
[1:26:54.320 --> 1:26:59.040]  He's like out of the country. I was about to say and they know that most the FBI most the law enforcement
[1:26:59.520 --> 1:27:04.920]  Aren't perfect, but they don't want to destroy the country. They're now watching. They're looking for false flags. They're now aware
[1:27:04.920 --> 1:27:08.960]  It's a whole new ballgame and they can they're because of wiki leaks now
[1:27:08.960 --> 1:27:13.960]  They're afraid to communicate so imagine you're the Germans and we're not broken their code. They know it
[1:27:13.960 --> 1:27:18.560]  So we know and if they if they get on the radio, they're gonna get a rocket right up the butt
[1:27:18.640 --> 1:27:21.200]  So they they're right now back on their heels
[1:27:21.200 --> 1:27:28.280]  I still expect some kind of a false flag attack. They need they it won't help them if there's a jihad terror attack
[1:27:28.280 --> 1:27:31.760]  That will help Trump. It will own and even BLM
[1:27:32.680 --> 1:27:37.840]  Riots won't help them. The only thing that's gonna help them is something like a Charleston shooting
[1:27:37.960 --> 1:27:42.680]  So I would look for some, you know, lunatic wave in a Confederate flag
[1:27:44.600 --> 1:27:49.080]  Patient they released it, you know, those are black church like you said or another, you know
[1:27:49.080 --> 1:27:53.800]  God forbid something like we saw with Sandy Hook and fortunately because of project Veritas
[1:27:53.800 --> 1:27:56.600]  We know their game plan. We know how they run this
[1:27:56.600 --> 1:28:03.140]  So they've got to be a little bit more careful and CNN meanwhile is making themselves a laughing stock, you know, Andrea Mitchell
[1:28:03.360 --> 1:28:08.960]  She was caught two weeks ago on an airplane where Hillary Clinton's press secretary
[1:28:08.960 --> 1:28:15.000]  Hand of the questions handing her the questions and it's on film. Will you ever see that on the mainstream media?
[1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:20.040]  No, I think they should have that in constant rotation. This is right on and by the way
[1:28:20.040 --> 1:28:23.400]  We have the WikiLeaks where they're giving the questions Donna Brazil twice
[1:28:24.040 --> 1:28:30.920]  Just that we caught her she's caught lying about it has to resign and you've got them also feeding the questions from the White House and Hillary
[1:28:31.560 --> 1:28:36.040]  Both directly on how to attack Trump. It's total lockstep fusion
[1:28:36.560 --> 1:28:39.720]  Donna Brazil is a great example. I just thought a
[1:28:39.720 --> 1:28:49.040]  Clipping of an old newspaper thing on the internet. She was fired from the Dukakis campaign for lying about a George Bush senior of
[1:28:49.760 --> 1:28:51.080]  Affair
[1:28:51.080 --> 1:28:58.080]  And she is so she's you know, we've been revived within the Democrat Party rising to the head of the DNC
[1:28:58.600 --> 1:29:03.200]  She has for the last few weeks been just saying oh, I'm not talking about that Russian propaganda
[1:29:03.200 --> 1:29:10.680]  Now when she's finally busted with more and more feeding debate questions now, she's saying basically screw you
[1:29:10.680 --> 1:29:16.400]  I'm proud to lie for the good guys are the Democrats. You know, she's basically saying I'm not ashamed at all
[1:29:16.480 --> 1:29:25.440]  We'll do whatever it takes. Well, I think that that Donna Brazil proud liar attitude is endemic throughout the mainstream
[1:29:25.440 --> 1:29:30.040]  I was about to say why do we see Gruber and then and then on Charlie Rose and all these shows?
[1:29:30.040 --> 1:29:34.880]  Laughing and saying thank God the public's done. We really ripped them off. Ha ha ha
[1:29:34.880 --> 1:29:41.080]  You're proud of it. I mean they talk about making Americans poor and smacking their lips
[1:29:41.080 --> 1:29:43.520]  It's like these are villains out of a cartoon
[1:29:44.320 --> 1:29:47.800]  they are and I hope that there's enough of us to wake up because
[1:29:48.960 --> 1:29:55.560]  Demographically we're doomed if they keep the borders wide open for another election cycle if they get another couple Ruth Bader
[1:29:55.560 --> 1:30:03.400]  Ginsburg's on the Supreme Court then the only way back will be a shooting civil war and a shooting civil war today won't be a clean
[1:30:03.400 --> 1:30:09.240]  North-South thing it you know like a war in northern Virginia with Richmond a line around Richmond
[1:30:09.280 --> 1:30:14.680]  It's going to be more like bloody, you know, bloody Kansas or Missouri, you know with
[1:30:15.240 --> 1:30:20.000]  Quantrill and the the red legs and you know, it'll be it'll be a war of of
[1:30:20.920 --> 1:30:22.040]  assassinations
[1:30:22.040 --> 1:30:26.560]  IEDs it's going to be a really nasty. It's going to be a it's going to be the war of the death squads
[1:30:27.040 --> 1:30:33.520]  Yeah, and and it's or like Argentina in the 70s with people being taken out on helicopters and thrown out in the ocean
[1:30:33.560 --> 1:30:35.640]  You know, it's going to be that kind of a war
[1:30:35.640 --> 1:30:39.640]  But I think that our military unlike say the Argentina military
[1:30:39.920 --> 1:30:45.160]  we take an oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic and
[1:30:45.640 --> 1:30:47.640]  most of the FBI agents
[1:30:47.640 --> 1:30:52.920]  Except for the more recent hires that are primarily social justice warriors. You have to bear in mind
[1:30:52.920 --> 1:31:00.800]  They've only been hiring social justice warriors for the last eight years only so the rank and file young hires are
[1:31:01.120 --> 1:31:06.760]  Down with destroying the Constitution and social justice warriors can be deprogrammed very quickly living in the real world
[1:31:06.760 --> 1:31:07.680]  and
[1:31:07.680 --> 1:31:12.760]  They can also they can also be deprogrammed by the old guys that are still there within the FBI
[1:31:12.760 --> 1:31:17.760]  So the FBI right now I think is our front line the Department of Justice
[1:31:17.760 --> 1:31:23.440]  It's lost but we know who the Stooges are and once and once Trump is elected. I mean
[1:31:25.040 --> 1:31:30.480]  Hopefully imagine Attorney General Rudy Giuliani going after these Matt Bracken. Thank you
[1:31:30.880 --> 1:31:32.880]  Please join us again in the next few days

[1:35:15.560 --> 1:35:17.560]  Brilliant Patriots Worldwide
[1:35:20.360 --> 1:35:24.440]  You're listening you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:35:24.680 --> 1:35:26.440]  And it's not that I'm that good
[1:35:26.440 --> 1:35:32.760]  It's that people are that hunger for freedom a very humble man who's about to join us dr. Ron Paul former congressman the
[1:35:34.120 --> 1:35:41.320]  Modern progenitor of the modern Liberty movement that Donald Trump is driving right now and in control of he always says
[1:35:41.320 --> 1:35:47.480]  Not about me. I'm just a focal point of this and he was known as dr. No because he would never vote on things that weren't 100% constitutional
[1:35:48.360 --> 1:35:49.880]  And I respect that
[1:35:49.880 --> 1:35:52.280]  But there's a paradox here and we'll talk to him in one moment
[1:35:52.440 --> 1:35:56.040]  Then and they get into the whole waterfront where we go after this election and the great work
[1:35:56.280 --> 1:35:59.000]  He and his son and others are doing a campaign for liberty
[1:35:59.080 --> 1:36:04.120]  But there is a paradox when the whole establishment's against Donald Trump. We know he's not perfect god far from it
[1:36:04.120 --> 1:36:06.120]  I wish he had Ron Paul's brain
[1:36:06.120 --> 1:36:14.040]  But but obviously the system doesn't want him so it's it's it's a major move against them and
[1:36:15.640 --> 1:36:19.240]  I just want to get his view on that out of the gates here in just a moment
[1:36:19.800 --> 1:36:23.160]  And I just love what they're doing with multimedia and all the stuff they've launched. That's the future
[1:36:23.960 --> 1:36:26.840]  18 million people just on our streams on facebook and youtube
[1:36:27.560 --> 1:36:30.920]  Just since yesterday 18 million people
[1:36:32.200 --> 1:36:34.200]  Folks I want to have 100 million by tomorrow
[1:36:34.200 --> 1:36:37.000]  Imagine how that you throw that in the face of cnn
[1:36:38.440 --> 1:36:42.040]  They're having peak ratings right now even though they've been plunging kind of a dead cat bounce
[1:36:42.520 --> 1:36:46.360]  They're only getting about a million people watching an hour. They're a joke people
[1:36:46.920 --> 1:36:51.080]  Again, it's not that we're that good. They're that bad. So this is a referendum on the establishment
[1:36:51.160 --> 1:36:54.520]  And it's kind of feel good to Ron Paul. I'm gonna talk to him here in just one moment
[1:36:54.520 --> 1:36:58.760]  What a lonely guy 20 something years ago couldn't get one cosponsored out of the fed now

[1:39:41.560 --> 1:39:45.240]  By the way, you've been spearheading this for a year in development. Great job. Thank you
[1:39:45.240 --> 1:39:49.480]  All right, he's only with us for 20 minutes until the end of the hour former congressman ron paul
[1:39:49.480 --> 1:39:56.200]  I already introduced him the omnibudsman of liberty. Uh, dr. No the guy that never compromised with tyranny. We appreciate you coming on with us
[1:39:57.480 --> 1:40:02.200]  Thank you. Good to be with you alex. I can ask a lot of questions, but just out of the gates. What do you think of this election?
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:06.040]  I think it's chaos
[1:40:06.040 --> 1:40:13.000]  I think it's a reflection of where we are economically speaking where we are monetarily speaking where we are on our foreign policy
[1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:18.600]  Totally chaotic. The people are angry and upset, but I don't think they've quite figured out exactly
[1:40:19.160 --> 1:40:23.240]  Where the problem is they don't think in philosophic terms. They think in political terms
[1:40:23.560 --> 1:40:28.600]  The problem is not political the political chicanery that goes on as a reflection of bad
[1:40:29.240 --> 1:40:36.600]  Philosophy whether it comes to economic policies this whole idea of kanesian economics. It's a failure. Just as socialism has failed
[1:40:37.080 --> 1:40:40.120]  Our system has failed and people don't quite see it that way
[1:40:40.120 --> 1:40:47.080]  A inflationism has failed the central banking ideas have failed and the foreign intervention has failed
[1:40:47.480 --> 1:40:51.560]  And yet they still think of details of well, maybe we need a better manager
[1:40:51.640 --> 1:40:56.360]  Maybe we ought to do it this way that way. We shouldn't go into this country. We should go into this other country
[1:40:56.440 --> 1:41:00.040]  We shouldn't spend so much money here. No, they missed the whole point
[1:41:00.520 --> 1:41:07.640]  That what we need is an understanding of what true liberty is all about and why that's an individual matter. It's not collective
[1:41:07.640 --> 1:41:13.160]  And quite frankly I spend my time talking to young people because I think that's what we need
[1:41:13.240 --> 1:41:17.560]  We need an educated new generation that will be more
[1:41:18.280 --> 1:41:25.400]  Intense on relying on liberty rather than relying on the political process where they're trying to get one advantage over another
[1:41:27.160 --> 1:41:29.720]  Do you have any predictions for this election that we're now in?
[1:41:29.720 --> 1:41:39.480]  Well, my prediction is that not a whole lot is going to change. I think the momentum is so great. There's a lot of good intentions out there
[1:41:40.120 --> 1:41:45.240]  But I think that the spending is going to continue. I think the printing of money is going to continue
[1:41:45.480 --> 1:41:50.680]  The deficits are going to continue. I've become cynical over the many decades. I've been involved
[1:41:51.240 --> 1:41:58.440]  I mean, even if you go back to the Ronald Reagan era, I was so excited about that. I was a support of his in 1976
[1:41:58.440 --> 1:42:04.840]  Uh, when when he was in the debt went up the spending went up and you know when the high when uh,
[1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:07.320]  The congress finally was controlled by republicans
[1:42:07.880 --> 1:42:12.520]  And the senate and the presidency guess what we spent more money than the democrat
[1:42:12.760 --> 1:42:15.880]  So i'm rather cynical about the whole thing the momentum is great
[1:42:16.200 --> 1:42:21.960]  And as much as we look toward and I certainly do look toward the positive side of the people waking up
[1:42:21.960 --> 1:42:29.640]  There's a lot of people out there that want government and I think the the the result of this election will be
[1:42:30.280 --> 1:42:35.080]  Probably 97 of the members of congress are going to be a reelected, you know
[1:42:35.240 --> 1:42:40.920]  It's going to be pretty much the status quo and uh, I I think we have more work to do
[1:42:41.400 --> 1:42:47.160]  In the intellectual sphere the understanding of economic policy the understanding of the nature of money
[1:42:47.160 --> 1:42:51.880]  And uh, then that will eventually be reflected in our members of congress
[1:42:52.200 --> 1:42:55.960]  You you mentioned in the introduction that I've done some work on the federal reserve
[1:42:56.360 --> 1:42:59.320]  But I I I worked hard in the congress
[1:42:59.400 --> 1:43:05.720]  I in especially when I interviewed the chairman of the federal reserve boards on various occasions, but my my
[1:43:06.600 --> 1:43:09.720]  Approach was to reach the people outside of washington
[1:43:10.040 --> 1:43:12.760]  So it was changing their understanding of their minds
[1:43:12.760 --> 1:43:17.720]  It finally got to the congressman, then they finally voted for the you know, at least in the house they voted to
[1:43:17.800 --> 1:43:21.720]  Well, sure, we're starting to see reform that seemed impossible and the reason I go there is this
[1:43:23.400 --> 1:43:28.120]  I know you're a purist that's that's why I respect you and and you've always stuck by your guns and that's the way to do it
[1:43:28.760 --> 1:43:35.800]  But expanding on that. I mean you've got the best voting record probably anybody, you know since since thomas jefferson, but if we expand on that
[1:43:37.240 --> 1:43:42.120]  The incredible awakening people know about the tpp. They know about globalism. They know about vote rigging
[1:43:42.120 --> 1:43:45.400]  They know about the fellow reserve. What is it like to watch trump?
[1:43:45.640 --> 1:43:48.920]  And I know he's not perfect bad on tortures iPhones, you know surveillance
[1:43:49.080 --> 1:43:53.400]  He doesn't get a lot of internet stuff. I mean he admits he's he's kind of a troglodyte when it comes to technology, but
[1:43:54.200 --> 1:43:59.720]  What is it like to see the movement that very gold water and the liberty movement and you grew the american people grew
[1:44:00.040 --> 1:44:01.880]  undoubtedly trump is
[1:44:01.880 --> 1:44:07.480]  A a a libertarian style insurrection into the republican party. They see it as outside. They're trying to reject it
[1:44:07.640 --> 1:44:09.880]  The libertarians have been taken over by the democrats and republicans
[1:44:09.880 --> 1:44:12.120]  They've got johnson and the other guy well
[1:44:13.240 --> 1:44:18.040]  Basically endorsing hillary that's outrageous. So all i'm saying is not an approval of
[1:44:18.360 --> 1:44:21.800]  I'm trying to get an endorsement of trump. I'm saying what is it like for you?
[1:44:22.440 --> 1:44:24.440]  To see the liberty movement
[1:44:24.760 --> 1:44:28.760]  Basically in the hands of trump with breitbart and others and I think breitbart are good folks
[1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:35.480]  Intending to fight on even of this election stolen all i'm saying is co-existing as original patriots
[1:44:36.120 --> 1:44:38.120]  You like yourself
[1:44:38.120 --> 1:44:41.160]  How do you see that co-existing with what's happened with trump?
[1:44:42.440 --> 1:44:44.680]  Well, you you admit that he's not perfect
[1:44:44.760 --> 1:44:49.960]  And i'm in the business of trying to present the case for liberty and not water it down
[1:44:50.280 --> 1:44:56.760]  And those who are more involved in politics back and forth and they say well a little watering down a little accepting a little bit
[1:44:56.760 --> 1:44:58.760]  Of hope a little bit of prayer
[1:44:59.080 --> 1:45:00.920]  You know, I don't have no any gripes with that
[1:45:01.320 --> 1:45:05.640]  But I think you have to be realistic that where are we today?
[1:45:05.640 --> 1:45:09.080]  I know there are circumstances and if you water it down a little bit, you know
[1:45:09.480 --> 1:45:13.320]  I used to say when I was campaigning that you know if
[1:45:14.280 --> 1:45:17.240]  If you talk about food stamps for the rich or the poor and you say well
[1:45:17.240 --> 1:45:19.240]  There's people who need so we have to help them out
[1:45:19.480 --> 1:45:22.280]  But there's only three percent of the people who need help
[1:45:22.520 --> 1:45:26.280]  So let's say let's say let's give help to the three percent of the people
[1:45:26.440 --> 1:45:30.440]  You give up a hundred percent of the principles that you're dealing with so
[1:45:30.440 --> 1:45:38.440]  So that's why if you water it down a little bit and understand it and if you're a political activist and you love this party stuff
[1:45:38.760 --> 1:45:40.760]  And you have high hopes
[1:45:40.840 --> 1:45:41.880]  Get people involved
[1:45:41.880 --> 1:45:47.080]  But the only benefit comes from people changing their minds and are understanding the people's
[1:45:47.640 --> 1:45:49.400]  attitudes have to be
[1:45:49.400 --> 1:45:52.600]  So sound that they reflect on the members of congress
[1:45:52.920 --> 1:45:56.600]  I don't think the people in congress, you know in hopes that they will
[1:45:56.600 --> 1:46:02.280]  Change their position a little bit that all of a sudden the people are going to wake up right now. There's too many people
[1:46:02.680 --> 1:46:07.640]  Uh, you know, I had a lot of young people came that came out during my campaign
[1:46:08.120 --> 1:46:10.920]  But you know it was I was more discouraged by the fact that
[1:46:11.560 --> 1:46:14.680]  Bernie Sanders got bigger crowds and he's a socialist
[1:46:14.920 --> 1:46:21.800]  So I knew boy my work is cut out for myself, you know, there's this so i'm dealing in that area changing people's minds
[1:46:21.800 --> 1:46:26.840]  Because quite frankly, I think that if we have an intellectual discussion
[1:46:27.320 --> 1:46:31.000]  Between what the free market is and socialism that we can win this
[1:46:31.080 --> 1:46:33.480]  I also work under the impression that
[1:46:33.960 --> 1:46:39.400]  Getting 51 percent to vote one way or the other isn't the important thing you need eight percent of the people
[1:46:39.800 --> 1:46:46.440]  Who are the thought leaders in the country the people who write the books and write the magazine and people like you that have an access
[1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:49.000]  You know to to the public
[1:46:49.000 --> 1:46:55.160]  They're the ones who have to understand it. So I I'm too discouraged about you know
[1:46:55.800 --> 1:47:03.080]  Nitpicking and changing a thing here this policy here this except this this isn't good a little protectionism doesn't hurt anything
[1:47:03.080 --> 1:47:05.080]  I gotta we gotta change the whole system
[1:47:05.080 --> 1:47:09.800]  We gotta change the whole fraudulent system on paul's our guest change the minds minds of the people
[1:47:09.880 --> 1:47:13.320]  That's what's happened and uh, you can only do that one person at a time
[1:47:13.880 --> 1:47:15.720]  Ron paul liberty report com
[1:47:15.720 --> 1:47:21.080]  You've got so many great sides tv shows radio shows. I hear it all over the radio. It's wonderful to almost see you
[1:47:22.120 --> 1:47:24.840]  Free or now that you're not in congress than you were before
[1:47:25.880 --> 1:47:27.880]  To really educate
[1:47:28.680 --> 1:47:30.680]  Yes, and I and I feel good about it
[1:47:31.800 --> 1:47:36.840]  That uh, you know, there's still an audience. You know, most people when they leave congress, uh, you know
[1:47:37.080 --> 1:47:39.720]  The alex jones of the world they don't call you up anymore
[1:47:39.800 --> 1:47:44.680]  But still there are people that are interested and I am pleased and I have to admit it that
[1:47:44.680 --> 1:47:50.440]  If they're interested in what I'm saying, you know, the most the most flattering thing that I had in washington
[1:47:50.760 --> 1:47:53.560]  Was I I went my own way. I didn't try to
[1:47:53.880 --> 1:47:57.640]  I think that I could fight with them and change their minds or give great speeches
[1:47:57.720 --> 1:48:01.080]  But I would vote if it were if it happened to be by myself
[1:48:01.160 --> 1:48:03.160]  I would do it in a quiet steady way
[1:48:03.400 --> 1:48:08.920]  But every once in a while a member of congress would come up and sit down beside me because I'd all be by myself voting
[1:48:09.240 --> 1:48:13.320]  And he would say why do you do that? Which was a sincere question
[1:48:13.320 --> 1:48:19.000]  So one person at a time like that and a few of them changed their ways and they become much more interested in
[1:48:19.080 --> 1:48:21.400]  Well, that's the point you did something with no support
[1:48:21.400 --> 1:48:26.840]  You did something with no support in congress and really change the paradigm to a great extent to at least have a national debate
[1:48:26.920 --> 1:48:31.320]  And that's why you know, I model myself just just just historically off seeing what you
[1:48:31.960 --> 1:48:35.160]  And others have done with the wind blowing in your face over time
[1:48:35.560 --> 1:48:40.760]  You end up turning the tables and getting back to trump because it's obviously the big phenomenon the election right now
[1:48:40.760 --> 1:48:43.400]  The the biggest reason I've supported him
[1:48:44.280 --> 1:48:48.520]  Is so that I could also sit there and point out things that were wrong and I've seen trump
[1:48:48.920 --> 1:48:54.520]  Actually change when he sees something is wrong if it's actually genuine and not from the establishment, but obviously
[1:48:55.240 --> 1:49:02.360]  Looking at trump because obviously people want to know what ron paul thinks about this the entire establishment the communist chinese the socialist pope
[1:49:02.840 --> 1:49:09.640]  Uh, the mexican presidents all the big corrupt combines the republican party machinery that that has attacked you and try to destroy you
[1:49:09.640 --> 1:49:12.520]  I mean, you know a man by his enemies and dr. Paul
[1:49:13.080 --> 1:49:18.440]  Trump has the same enemies you had the same enemies I have and they are so opposed to him
[1:49:18.840 --> 1:49:22.520]  I think that's undoubtable. So what do you think of that and what do you think that signifies?
[1:49:23.400 --> 1:49:29.720]  Well, I I think what you're doing is fine and dandy and you make those points and you can make inroads
[1:49:29.800 --> 1:49:33.720]  But my approach has been been different. I take it out of the personalities
[1:49:33.800 --> 1:49:37.560]  I never wanted when I you bet you can't find anything. I've ever sat on the house floor about
[1:49:37.560 --> 1:49:44.440]  Oh, you know, the president united states is a bum or are saying the democrats are, you know, the paul and it's all the fault of the
[1:49:45.080 --> 1:49:51.720]  Democrat no, I'm always going to be talking about changing people's minds about why printing money is lousy
[1:49:52.280 --> 1:49:54.840]  Why fighting wars overseas is bad and not
[1:49:55.800 --> 1:50:01.640]  You're a gentleman who is who is reaching out to people trying to change them and trump is more of a bull in a china cabinet
[1:50:01.640 --> 1:50:08.920]  I think that's the case and they're hopefully that uh, there's room for both both ways of changing things because uh,
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:13.560]  You know, I sort of enjoy the idea though. I've never really became a trump supporter
[1:50:13.720 --> 1:50:17.880]  I enjoyed the idea that right now we're winning on some of these issues
[1:50:17.960 --> 1:50:25.000]  One is that it's a little bit more popular to challenge political correctness than it was a few years ago
[1:50:25.240 --> 1:50:29.400]  And I think the american people are waking up. They're so sick and tired of that
[1:50:29.400 --> 1:50:32.200]  Bingo bingo. That's what I'm saying dr. Paul
[1:50:32.920 --> 1:50:37.960]  It is that trump has taken what you built and others built and we built and magnified it
[1:50:37.960 --> 1:50:40.680]  There's some imperfections there, but but I think I just heard you right
[1:50:40.920 --> 1:50:48.200]  You said I'm kind of a trump supporter on the fact that he's made it okay to have free speech and stand up against the bullying of the pc
[1:50:48.200 --> 1:50:49.320]  crowd
[1:50:49.320 --> 1:50:52.360]  Okay, well, no, I'm glad that has happened
[1:50:52.360 --> 1:50:58.040]  But I see it in a in a difference in a different sense because I use it in a different fashion
[1:50:58.040 --> 1:51:02.440]  I would say well who uses which bathroom is a private property issue
[1:51:02.440 --> 1:51:06.840]  We need to deal with the issue of privacy. Why do governments own these things?
[1:51:06.840 --> 1:51:12.440]  Why in the world would we be talking about this because people can't walk into our houses and decide to who's
[1:51:12.440 --> 1:51:15.960]  Yeah, why is the government involved on businesses should have whatever they want?
[1:51:15.960 --> 1:51:18.280]  Do you want to have the same sex? Do you want to have them separate?
[1:51:18.280 --> 1:51:23.960]  I want them I want them to use the total principle of freedom
[1:51:23.960 --> 1:51:30.600]  Property rights for voluntary contracts non-aggression principle. I want to always emphasize the philosophic
[1:51:31.320 --> 1:51:38.520]  Underpinnings of what we're talking about and you're dealing, you know one of the specifics and you will go a certain way politically
[1:51:38.520 --> 1:51:45.240]  But I've lost any enthusiasm for thinking that you know if we get a few more people in Congress next year
[1:51:45.240 --> 1:51:48.600]  We're going to have a balanced budget. No that is not going to happen
[1:51:48.600 --> 1:51:52.760]  I never really believed it never went there with the intention went there as a surprise
[1:51:52.760 --> 1:51:56.760]  because I didn't think anybody would vote for me if I took this position
[1:51:56.760 --> 1:52:00.760]  of you know saying that governments should be very very small
[1:52:00.760 --> 1:52:02.760]  Sure, well you know Nigel Farage
[1:52:02.760 --> 1:52:04.760]  You take on everybody
[1:52:04.760 --> 1:52:06.760]  You know who Nigel Farage is of you
[1:52:06.760 --> 1:52:10.760]  Sure and he said on air before that your work inspired him 20-something years ago
[1:52:10.760 --> 1:52:14.760]  and that when a lot of folks he would he would he would go speak to in England back when their party was tiny
[1:52:14.760 --> 1:52:20.760]  were listeners of yours and listeners of mine so all I'm saying is it's got to feel good
[1:52:20.760 --> 1:52:24.760]  to know that you've affected elections in Europe
[1:52:24.760 --> 1:52:28.760]  that the libertarian ideas the Von Mies Institute that you've been quarterbacking are having big effects
[1:52:28.760 --> 1:52:30.760]  all I'm saying is
[1:52:30.760 --> 1:52:32.760]  Trump is basically
[1:52:32.760 --> 1:52:34.760]  at his core adopting all of that
[1:52:34.760 --> 1:52:38.760]  I don't think he's so much political as he is just kind of you know like a you know promoter
[1:52:38.760 --> 1:52:42.760]  where he agrees with you know a lot of folks he's around and says nice things to crowds
[1:52:42.760 --> 1:52:44.760]  he's with but at his core
[1:52:44.760 --> 1:52:48.760]  I know he really respects you he's told me that personally he said it in public
[1:52:48.760 --> 1:52:52.760]  and I'm sad that you know random he got in fights and things but both people did things were probably not too good
[1:52:52.760 --> 1:52:54.760]  but that happens in the political campaign
[1:52:54.760 --> 1:52:58.760]  all I'm saying is if a Donald Trump got elected and you had a free hand
[1:52:58.760 --> 1:53:02.760]  would you be an advisor would you be the head of the Treasury or are you done
[1:53:02.760 --> 1:53:06.760]  Well now he's not going to because I'm dealing on a different level
[1:53:06.760 --> 1:53:10.760]  I'm dealing in the theoretical and the philosophic
[1:53:10.760 --> 1:53:12.760]  and I don't think he's there
[1:53:12.760 --> 1:53:17.760]  he picks up bits and pieces and he uses it and when it seems to be beneficial
[1:53:17.760 --> 1:53:19.760]  yes he'll use it
[1:53:19.760 --> 1:53:22.760]  I mean if somebody asks me a question I'm not going to turn them down
[1:53:22.760 --> 1:53:26.760]  but just as you know I was pleased when I got one or two or three members of Congress
[1:53:26.760 --> 1:53:28.760]  asked me a serious question
[1:53:28.760 --> 1:53:32.760]  I didn't have the John Bainers of the world come and say
[1:53:32.760 --> 1:53:36.760]  Ron I think what we need is for you to be you know chairman of the committee
[1:53:36.760 --> 1:53:40.760]  no they had to work very hard to keep me ever from getting any
[1:53:40.760 --> 1:53:44.760]  No no when Trump is different what I'm telling you is I know now the inside baseball
[1:53:44.760 --> 1:53:47.760]  where he and Rand got in all those spats he was looking at Rand as a VP
[1:53:47.760 --> 1:53:52.760]  and I know for a fact he respects you and was wanting to talk to you about economic policy
[1:53:52.760 --> 1:53:58.760]  so I mean and it's not patronizing I'm telling you you know that Donald Trump really really
[1:53:58.760 --> 1:54:02.760]  really thinks you know what you're talking about and I get he's wrong on interest rates and things
[1:54:02.760 --> 1:54:05.760]  you know he's saying keep them low I think we have to say they should go up I mean obviously
[1:54:05.760 --> 1:54:09.760]  the point is he's open to it he really wants to make the country successful
[1:54:09.760 --> 1:54:12.760]  he understands we have unfair trade deals
[1:54:12.760 --> 1:54:16.760]  and I think that's why the elite are against him is he's not out to get the people
[1:54:16.760 --> 1:54:19.760]  he wants prosperity now Ron Paul
[1:54:19.760 --> 1:54:22.760]  he wants prosperity too
[1:54:22.760 --> 1:54:27.760]  yeah but that's not where I am I'm trying to change attitudes
[1:54:27.760 --> 1:54:31.760]  that would support him to do the right things rather than me saying
[1:54:31.760 --> 1:54:35.760]  well if I support Trump or say this and this and sort it all out that's a political thing
[1:54:35.760 --> 1:54:38.760]  what I want to do is go out and get people to understand
[1:54:38.760 --> 1:54:42.760]  you know exactly the philosophy behind it and why you have to reject the
[1:54:42.760 --> 1:54:46.760]  authoritarianism of the government and so when he's right on those issues he's going to have
[1:54:46.760 --> 1:54:50.760]  more support it would be much more valuable for him to have support of tens of thousands
[1:54:50.760 --> 1:54:53.760]  of people that may have been educated
[1:54:53.760 --> 1:54:57.760]  no I get it you're not about the political you're all about the right philosophical
[1:54:57.760 --> 1:54:59.760]  economic move
[1:54:59.760 --> 1:55:03.760]  matter of fact I think it's 90% of everything that we do and I was in politics
[1:55:03.760 --> 1:55:07.760]  but I was in politics for participating in the educational opportunity
[1:55:07.760 --> 1:55:11.760]  that's also Alex the reason why I have a home schooling organization
[1:55:11.760 --> 1:55:13.760]  nobody knows a whole lot about that
[1:55:13.760 --> 1:55:16.760]  I was going to bring that up next take our children out of the system
[1:55:16.760 --> 1:55:18.760]  tell us about that
[1:55:18.760 --> 1:55:23.760]  well yes and Gary Norris and Tom Woods helped me start this
[1:55:23.760 --> 1:55:26.760]  and they have a fantastic thing going
[1:55:26.760 --> 1:55:29.760]  and quite frankly it's not gigantic
[1:55:29.760 --> 1:55:33.760]  we don't have the numbers that you have but systematically more and more
[1:55:33.760 --> 1:55:38.760]  the public school system is terrible in this whole thing of political correctness
[1:55:38.760 --> 1:55:40.760]  it's all in the public system
[1:55:40.760 --> 1:55:44.760]  so I think more and more people I think if we lose our rights to
[1:55:44.760 --> 1:55:47.760]  property rights to have our private school system
[1:55:47.760 --> 1:55:48.760]  I agree
[1:55:48.760 --> 1:55:51.760]  I mean then we're in real trouble as long as we have that
[1:55:51.760 --> 1:55:55.760]  and more and more people are going to come because people are sick of the
[1:55:55.760 --> 1:55:57.760]  you know government school system
[1:55:57.760 --> 1:56:00.760]  so that's where I'm optimistic and some people have told me
[1:56:00.760 --> 1:56:04.760]  that's probably one of the most positive things that I'm doing at this point
[1:56:04.760 --> 1:56:07.760]  well by the way you say your own homeschooling
[1:56:07.760 --> 1:56:10.760]  sure your own homeschooling deal has got a lot of people signed up to it
[1:56:10.760 --> 1:56:12.760]  but the homeschooling movement itself is exploding
[1:56:12.760 --> 1:56:14.760]  folks can find out more at RonPaulLibertyReport.com
[1:56:14.760 --> 1:56:16.760]  let me ask you this then
[1:56:16.760 --> 1:56:18.760]  what is your gut on this election?
[1:56:18.760 --> 1:56:20.760]  I mean he's ahead in battleground states
[1:56:20.760 --> 1:56:22.760]  they keep oversampling Democrats 10, 15, 20 points
[1:56:22.760 --> 1:56:24.760]  they've been caught in wiki leaks
[1:56:24.760 --> 1:56:26.760]  fixing polls, getting questions beforehand
[1:56:26.760 --> 1:56:28.760]  rigging things we know
[1:56:28.760 --> 1:56:30.760]  and I think PankyPanky happened to you
[1:56:30.760 --> 1:56:32.760]  when you'd be winning in New Hampshire in places
[1:56:32.760 --> 1:56:34.760]  I mean what's your gut about the election tell you?
[1:56:36.760 --> 1:56:40.760]  well I haven't relied on my gut too much
[1:56:40.760 --> 1:56:42.760]  sure what's the analysis?
[1:56:42.760 --> 1:56:45.760]  I look at the financial markets
[1:56:45.760 --> 1:56:49.760]  and unfortunately the financial markets this last couple of days went against
[1:56:49.760 --> 1:56:51.760]  against Trump
[1:56:51.760 --> 1:56:53.760]  because you know the way they responded
[1:56:53.760 --> 1:56:55.760]  oh Hillary wants something, Hillary wants something
[1:56:55.760 --> 1:56:58.760]  so therefore what he is so sad is that because
[1:56:58.760 --> 1:57:01.760]  it was interpreted, Hillary wants something with the
[1:57:01.760 --> 1:57:04.760]  director of the FBI coming out
[1:57:04.760 --> 1:57:07.760]  that the markets which are supposed to be free markets and capitalism
[1:57:07.760 --> 1:57:09.760]  they responded with glee
[1:57:09.760 --> 1:57:12.760]  the stock market skyrocketed nearly 400 points
[1:57:12.760 --> 1:57:15.760]  that to me is a sad state of fair
[1:57:15.760 --> 1:57:18.760]  that shows the control but now there's some jitters
[1:57:18.760 --> 1:57:20.760]  now there's some jitters is my point
[1:57:20.760 --> 1:57:23.760]  so you're thinking of Hillary when?
[1:57:23.760 --> 1:57:26.760]  right now I'm saying the markets think that
[1:57:26.760 --> 1:57:29.760]  I think that right now
[1:57:29.760 --> 1:57:31.760]  I'm not predicting
[1:57:31.760 --> 1:57:33.760]  I'm not betting any money
[1:57:33.760 --> 1:57:35.760]  I did a program today on my program that said
[1:57:35.760 --> 1:57:38.760]  the momentum I just try to describe where the momentum is
[1:57:38.760 --> 1:57:41.760]  after this election is over and I didn't pick a winner
[1:57:41.760 --> 1:57:43.760]  that we are still going to spend more money
[1:57:43.760 --> 1:57:45.760]  we're going to get bigger government
[1:57:45.760 --> 1:57:47.760]  taxes will not go down
[1:57:47.760 --> 1:57:49.760]  the troops won't go down
[1:57:49.760 --> 1:57:51.760]  I agree but the awakening momentum
[1:57:51.760 --> 1:57:54.760]  has never been bigger so let me ask you this in closing then
[1:57:54.760 --> 1:57:56.760]  Dr. Ron Paul is our guest
[1:57:56.760 --> 1:57:58.760]  looking at this
[1:57:58.760 --> 1:58:00.760]  I mean just looking at Hillary
[1:58:00.760 --> 1:58:02.760]  she's so bad
[1:58:02.760 --> 1:58:04.760]  she's so evil she wants war with Russia
[1:58:04.760 --> 1:58:07.760]  I mean just for world peace isn't it positive
[1:58:07.760 --> 1:58:10.760]  that Trump doesn't want war with Russia
[1:58:10.760 --> 1:58:13.760]  and doesn't want to back radical Islam?
[1:58:13.760 --> 1:58:16.760]  yeah but I don't want to get into a debate on this
[1:58:16.760 --> 1:58:19.760]  I would concede that but then I could throw out something else
[1:58:19.760 --> 1:58:21.760]  where he might be more likely to cause trouble
[1:58:21.760 --> 1:58:23.760]  but I don't want to get into that
[1:58:23.760 --> 1:58:25.760]  that's back into the personality and bickering between
[1:58:25.760 --> 1:58:27.760]  you know political factions
[1:58:27.760 --> 1:58:29.760]  and I think elections are phony
[1:58:29.760 --> 1:58:31.760]  I think you might not agree with this one
[1:58:31.760 --> 1:58:33.760]  but just think
[1:58:33.760 --> 1:58:35.760]  you know the establishment, the deep state
[1:58:35.760 --> 1:58:37.760]  they've controlled these elections
[1:58:37.760 --> 1:58:39.760]  we control them overseas, they control them here too
[1:58:39.760 --> 1:58:41.760]  so whether you had Ron
[1:58:41.760 --> 1:58:43.760]  or Obama
[1:58:43.760 --> 1:58:46.760]  you know darn well that policies weren't going to change
[1:58:46.760 --> 1:58:48.760]  you're hopeful, you're keeping your fingers crossed
[1:58:48.760 --> 1:58:50.760]  I hope you're right, I hope
[1:58:50.760 --> 1:58:52.760]  things you know if
[1:58:52.760 --> 1:58:54.760]  if a Trump would win, things would be better
[1:58:54.760 --> 1:58:56.760]  but no Dr. Paul
[1:58:56.760 --> 1:58:58.760]  this is why I respect you
[1:58:58.760 --> 1:59:00.760]  you're always honest, no I agree with you
[1:59:00.760 --> 1:59:02.760]  I came in this morning and I said
[1:59:02.760 --> 1:59:04.760]  they're preparing everyone for a Trump loss
[1:59:04.760 --> 1:59:06.760]  even though he's winning, I said to the crew
[1:59:06.760 --> 1:59:08.760]  I said the deep state doesn't want him
[1:59:08.760 --> 1:59:10.760]  and that's why he's good
[1:59:10.760 --> 1:59:12.760]  he's not a Ron Paul
[1:59:12.760 --> 1:59:14.760]  but a Ron Paul is not a Donald Trump
[1:59:14.760 --> 1:59:16.760]  you both have different attributes
[1:59:16.760 --> 1:59:18.760]  and we'll see
[1:59:18.760 --> 1:59:20.760]  but you're right, this election staged
[1:59:20.760 --> 1:59:22.760]  and they've rigged the whole deal
[1:59:22.760 --> 1:59:24.760]  and I think Donald Trump's right then
[1:59:24.760 --> 1:59:26.760]  you just said it to say it's rigged
[1:59:26.760 --> 1:59:28.760]  is Donald Trump right on that?
[1:59:28.760 --> 1:59:30.760]  well it's been rigged for a long time
[1:59:30.760 --> 1:59:32.760]  my first election was in 1976
[1:59:32.760 --> 1:59:34.760]  and I lost by
[1:59:34.760 --> 1:59:36.760]  100 votes on election
[1:59:36.760 --> 1:59:38.760]  and we found
[1:59:38.760 --> 1:59:40.760]  1,350 votes
[1:59:40.760 --> 1:59:42.760]  of absolutely
[1:59:42.760 --> 1:59:44.760]  fraudulent votes
[1:59:44.760 --> 1:59:46.760]  we won in the course until
[1:59:46.760 --> 1:59:48.760]  it got to the Supreme Court of Texas
[1:59:48.760 --> 1:59:50.760]  and then we won there
[1:59:50.760 --> 1:59:52.760]  and then the next day they threw out one judge
[1:59:52.760 --> 1:59:54.760]  and said there was something wrong with him
[1:59:54.760 --> 1:59:56.760]  had a new election and of course
[1:59:56.760 --> 1:59:58.760]  we lost the
[1:59:58.760 --> 2:00:00.760]  court contest too
[2:00:00.760 --> 2:00:02.760]  but that's way back then
[2:00:02.760 --> 2:00:04.760]  I don't want to put words in your mouth
[2:00:04.760 --> 2:00:06.760]  you're saying the system's been rigged for a long time
[2:00:06.760 --> 2:00:08.760]  and you think it's rigged against Trump
[2:00:08.760 --> 2:00:10.760]  because the establishment clearly wants Hillary
[2:00:10.760 --> 2:00:12.760]  I don't have any evidence
[2:00:12.760 --> 2:00:14.760]  of who gets rigging or what not
[2:00:14.760 --> 2:00:16.760]  but I just think that
[2:00:16.760 --> 2:00:18.760]  I think because
[2:00:18.760 --> 2:00:20.760]  what I have to say will be more of a
[2:00:20.760 --> 2:00:22.760]  more of a challenge to you because
[2:00:22.760 --> 2:00:24.760]  I think that
[2:00:24.760 --> 2:00:26.760]  some of the policies that Trump has
[2:00:26.760 --> 2:00:28.760]  supports may be there because
[2:00:28.760 --> 2:00:30.760]  he's been told he has to take certain positions
[2:00:30.760 --> 2:00:32.760]  wow
[2:00:32.760 --> 2:00:34.760]  alright, as you're saying it might be political
[2:00:34.760 --> 2:00:36.760]  Dr. Paul, thank you for the time amazing interview
[2:00:36.760 --> 2:00:38.760]  we look forward to speaking to you again soon
[2:00:38.760 --> 2:00:40.760]  that was the best ever, they just get better and better
[2:00:40.760 --> 2:00:42.760]  alright, we're coming back in the next hour, Gerald Salente
[2:00:42.760 --> 2:00:44.760]  and more, thank you Dr. Paul, that was amazing
[2:00:44.760 --> 2:00:46.760]  I'm Alex Jones, spread the word, spread the feed
[2:00:46.760 --> 2:01:08.760]  www.infowars.com
[2:01:16.760 --> 2:01:44.760]  www.infowars.com
[2:01:44.760 --> 2:01:48.760]  www.infowarswives.com
[2:01:48.760 --> 2:01:52.760]  www.infowarswives.com
[2:01:52.760 --> 2:02:12.760]  www.infowarswives.com
[2:02:12.760 --> 2:02:16.520]  Mainstream media, government coverups.
[2:02:16.520 --> 2:02:18.200]  You want to stop tyranny?
[2:02:18.200 --> 2:02:19.840]  Well, so does he.
[2:02:19.840 --> 2:02:25.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:02:25.000 --> 2:02:27.360]  Well, Niko Acustum, I've had producer and others
[2:02:27.360 --> 2:02:29.640]  who've agreed that was the best Ron Paul interview ever.
[2:02:29.640 --> 2:02:31.440]  We have Ventura coming on Friday,
[2:02:31.440 --> 2:02:34.920]  and I'm going to put his feet to the fire in a nice way as well.
[2:02:34.920 --> 2:02:36.320]  And you say you're supporting Gary Johnson,
[2:02:36.320 --> 2:02:38.640]  because you're against two parties?
[2:02:38.640 --> 2:02:41.360]  Johnson and Weld are endorsing Hillary.
[2:02:41.360 --> 2:02:45.440]  Hillary is an out-of-control demon.
[2:02:45.440 --> 2:02:47.160]  And I get Paul his purity.
[2:02:47.160 --> 2:02:49.360]  He wants to change minds and sell free market.
[2:02:49.360 --> 2:02:50.440]  I love that.
[2:02:50.440 --> 2:02:52.600]  He doesn't want to get in the whole trenches
[2:02:52.600 --> 2:02:54.960]  of political promises.
[2:02:54.960 --> 2:02:59.400]  And I get him saying, he was looting to it,
[2:02:59.400 --> 2:03:04.680]  Trump's like, I'll give special tax cuts just to black people.
[2:03:04.680 --> 2:03:06.400]  And I get the argument, OK, you start
[2:03:06.400 --> 2:03:08.080]  compromising and giving people this and that
[2:03:08.080 --> 2:03:09.360]  because of what group they are.
[2:03:09.360 --> 2:03:11.000]  You've now become his bastard Democrats.
[2:03:11.000 --> 2:03:13.800]  How do you counter them trying to cause a race war
[2:03:13.800 --> 2:03:15.600]  and all this division?
[2:03:15.600 --> 2:03:17.680]  We want people off the plantation.
[2:03:17.680 --> 2:03:19.960]  There's got to be 40 acres in a mule.
[2:03:19.960 --> 2:03:23.200]  Most black folks ever got the 40 acres in a mule.
[2:03:23.200 --> 2:03:24.960]  So it's their own tax money.
[2:03:24.960 --> 2:03:28.240]  I don't see it as a freebie.
[2:03:28.240 --> 2:03:29.720]  I want everybody's taxes cut.
[2:03:29.720 --> 2:03:31.160]  But if we can use political correctness
[2:03:31.160 --> 2:03:35.080]  to get somebody's taxes cut, I'll do it.
[2:03:35.080 --> 2:03:36.840]  I'm going to tell you, I don't like driving through neighborhoods
[2:03:36.840 --> 2:03:38.640]  and seeing poor desperate people.
[2:03:38.640 --> 2:03:41.680]  I might like the WikiLeaks stuff on Hillary
[2:03:41.680 --> 2:03:43.520]  where they're calling black people dumb and pathetic
[2:03:43.520 --> 2:03:45.320]  and getting off on it.
[2:03:45.320 --> 2:03:47.720]  That's the essence of these trash, folks.
[2:03:47.720 --> 2:03:51.040]  They like seeing people not doing good.
[2:03:51.040 --> 2:03:52.680]  But I think that's the demarcation line
[2:03:52.680 --> 2:03:56.120]  between a good person and a bad person.
[2:03:56.120 --> 2:03:58.280]  I've seen people that if you've got a beautiful girlfriend
[2:03:58.280 --> 2:04:00.560]  or a beautiful wife, they get there upset with you.
[2:04:00.560 --> 2:04:01.800]  Well, that's so you don't want to be around.
[2:04:01.800 --> 2:04:02.880]  Or you've got a good business.
[2:04:02.880 --> 2:04:04.040]  You're a great painter or artist.
[2:04:04.040 --> 2:04:04.960]  They're jealous of you.
[2:04:04.960 --> 2:04:08.320]  Instead of wanting to be around you and it's like,
[2:04:08.320 --> 2:04:10.640]  I was always blind because I'm not the best looking now.
[2:04:10.640 --> 2:04:13.120]  But I was like a Calvin Klein model when I was younger.
[2:04:13.120 --> 2:04:15.520]  And I had girlfriends that were just beautiful.
[2:04:15.520 --> 2:04:17.480]  They'd be pissed saying, you're just too good looking.
[2:04:17.480 --> 2:04:18.520]  You're better looking than I am.
[2:04:18.520 --> 2:04:19.560]  They'd be mad at me about it.
[2:04:19.560 --> 2:04:21.080]  I didn't even make sense.
[2:04:21.080 --> 2:04:23.520]  And I didn't click why I'd go over the place.
[2:04:23.520 --> 2:04:24.960]  People start fighting for no reason.
[2:04:24.960 --> 2:04:26.840]  It was because I was a blonde-haired blue-eyed,
[2:04:26.840 --> 2:04:29.400]  really good-looking guy.
[2:04:29.400 --> 2:04:31.000]  V-shaped the whole nine yards.
[2:04:31.000 --> 2:04:33.160]  And I'm not bragging about that story to sound cool.
[2:04:33.160 --> 2:04:35.720]  I mean, I've told you bad stuff where I paid for abortions.
[2:04:35.720 --> 2:04:37.000]  I just tell you everything, folks.
[2:04:37.000 --> 2:04:38.240]  There's no filter here.
[2:04:38.240 --> 2:04:39.520]  It's all just real.
[2:04:39.520 --> 2:04:42.960]  And I think that's the demarcation line,
[2:04:42.960 --> 2:04:45.720]  is a Gerald Salente wants prosperity
[2:04:45.720 --> 2:04:47.200]  and hates seeing his town fall apart.
[2:04:47.200 --> 2:04:49.080]  And Alex Jones wants prosperity.
[2:04:49.080 --> 2:04:51.680]  And prosperity based on real equity,
[2:04:51.680 --> 2:04:54.240]  real-level playing field, real freedom.
[2:04:54.240 --> 2:04:55.640]  Just like a high-quality restaurant
[2:04:55.640 --> 2:04:58.200]  or a high-quality clothing or a high-quality shop
[2:04:58.200 --> 2:05:01.240]  or a high-quality store that's a family-owned.
[2:05:01.240 --> 2:05:03.160]  You've got quality and they treat you with respect.
[2:05:03.160 --> 2:05:04.160]  You treat them with respect.
[2:05:04.160 --> 2:05:05.240]  Salete always talks about that
[2:05:05.240 --> 2:05:06.680]  because it's the heart of community.
[2:05:06.680 --> 2:05:07.520]  It's humanity.
[2:05:07.520 --> 2:05:08.840]  Why do you think, I'm not saying this is Italian,
[2:05:08.840 --> 2:05:12.360]  this is true, every sports shack I wear is Italian
[2:05:12.360 --> 2:05:13.960]  because they're the best cut.
[2:05:13.960 --> 2:05:15.960]  All the sunglasses I got are Italian.
[2:05:15.960 --> 2:05:16.800]  Why?
[2:05:16.800 --> 2:05:18.840]  Because they demand quality.
[2:05:18.840 --> 2:05:20.240]  Now, it's a stereotype.
[2:05:20.240 --> 2:05:21.440]  It's a true stereotype.
[2:05:21.440 --> 2:05:22.960]  Too bad that Italians aren't having any kids,
[2:05:22.960 --> 2:05:25.840]  so Italy's about to become North Africa.
[2:05:25.840 --> 2:05:30.120]  But the point is that what I'm getting at here
[2:05:30.120 --> 2:05:32.400]  is that McDonald's admittedly said,
[2:05:32.400 --> 2:05:33.560]  we're gonna get rid of our staff
[2:05:33.560 --> 2:05:36.120]  by saying throw your trash away, thank you.
[2:05:36.120 --> 2:05:38.080]  All you did was lower the quality
[2:05:38.080 --> 2:05:41.320]  of restaurants nationwide by stamping your fingers.
[2:05:41.320 --> 2:05:43.080]  It's the quality we demand.
[2:05:43.080 --> 2:05:45.240]  We don't kill granny like Bill Gates said
[2:05:45.240 --> 2:05:47.000]  in the higher 10 teachers.
[2:05:47.000 --> 2:05:48.320]  We kill the society.
[2:05:48.320 --> 2:05:49.720]  You take care of granny.
[2:05:49.720 --> 2:05:51.200]  You have a culture that takes care of granny.
[2:05:51.200 --> 2:05:52.560]  You just raised the standard.
[2:05:52.560 --> 2:05:53.920]  You just created more jobs.
[2:05:53.920 --> 2:05:56.840]  You just raised the empathy of the species.
[2:05:56.840 --> 2:06:00.200]  They've trained you to not care and not be involved.
[2:06:00.200 --> 2:06:02.000]  They've trained you to act like a buffoon,
[2:06:02.000 --> 2:06:03.000]  to act like an idiot.
[2:06:03.000 --> 2:06:06.080]  They've trained you to give up the respect you deserve.
[2:06:06.080 --> 2:06:07.720]  I always hear this thing people say
[2:06:07.720 --> 2:06:09.400]  in the old days in Texas, but all of the place,
[2:06:09.400 --> 2:06:11.920]  any place that has culture, you better respect us.
[2:06:11.920 --> 2:06:13.120]  We're gonna respect you.
[2:06:13.120 --> 2:06:14.200]  You're gonna respect us.
[2:06:14.200 --> 2:06:16.920]  And you don't respect us, get out of our lives.
[2:06:16.920 --> 2:06:18.640]  And we sit there with this mainstream media
[2:06:18.640 --> 2:06:21.520]  disrespecting us with disinformation and lies
[2:06:21.520 --> 2:06:23.160]  and pissing on our backs.
[2:06:23.160 --> 2:06:25.840]  And let me tell you who's shameful, us that put up with it.
[2:06:25.840 --> 2:06:28.680]  The mainstream media is a total enemy, a total joke,
[2:06:28.680 --> 2:06:30.600]  and they have screwed themselves over.
[2:06:30.600 --> 2:06:31.560]  That's the good news.
[2:06:31.560 --> 2:06:32.840]  We'll talk about everything with Gerald Salenty
[2:06:32.840 --> 2:06:34.000]  on the other side of this break.
[2:06:34.000 --> 2:06:35.400]  Leigh Ann McAdoo comes in in the fourth hour.
[2:06:35.400 --> 2:06:37.200]  I'll co-host some with her.
[2:06:37.200 --> 2:06:38.760]  I'm gonna go vote after that.
[2:06:38.760 --> 2:06:41.120]  Mainly just inspect what's going on and see what's happening.
[2:06:41.120 --> 2:06:43.080]  I know the state rules, I'm sure they're gonna flip out
[2:06:43.080 --> 2:06:44.880]  and say, don't have a camera, man.
[2:06:44.880 --> 2:06:47.160]  I'll be like 200 feet back, but that's all gonna happen.
[2:06:47.160 --> 2:06:48.640]  That'll be a lot of Facebook mentions.
[2:06:48.640 --> 2:06:51.720]  But I'm on fire because when losers draw for Trump,
[2:06:52.600 --> 2:06:55.760]  Hillary and the mainstream media have destroyed themselves
[2:06:55.760 --> 2:06:57.400]  and it's a beautiful time to be alive.
[2:06:57.400 --> 2:06:58.240]  Stay with us.
[2:06:59.880 --> 2:07:02.840]  Hillary Clinton wins the election.
[2:07:02.840 --> 2:07:06.040]  She has defeated the fear and hate-based conservative,
[2:07:06.040 --> 2:07:07.080]  Donald Trump.
[2:07:07.080 --> 2:07:09.080]  Well, that's according to Newsweek,
[2:07:09.080 --> 2:07:11.080]  who reportedly has already issued
[2:07:11.080 --> 2:07:12.920]  a special commemorative edition
[2:07:12.920 --> 2:07:15.640]  with Hillary on the cover behind the words,
[2:07:15.640 --> 2:07:16.880]  Madam President.
[2:07:16.880 --> 2:07:20.400]  Hillary Clinton's historic journey to the White House.
[2:07:20.400 --> 2:07:21.840]  They know something we don't.
[2:07:21.840 --> 2:07:24.880]  DC Close Line reports that the fix is in.
[2:07:24.880 --> 2:07:27.120]  Newsweek already has an issue in print,
[2:07:27.120 --> 2:07:28.520]  boxed and ready to ship,
[2:07:28.520 --> 2:07:30.520]  declaring Hillary the winner.
[2:07:30.520 --> 2:07:32.280]  But others think the whole thing
[2:07:32.280 --> 2:07:33.520]  might be a hoax.
[2:07:33.520 --> 2:07:35.480]  Newsweek has been asked repeatedly
[2:07:35.480 --> 2:07:37.120]  whether the magazine is real,
[2:07:37.120 --> 2:07:39.600]  but has failed to respond so far.
[2:07:39.600 --> 2:07:41.400]  If the issue is indeed a fake,
[2:07:41.400 --> 2:07:42.800]  well, it's very convincing.
[2:07:42.800 --> 2:07:44.440]  The one thing we know for sure
[2:07:44.440 --> 2:07:46.720]  is that Newsweek will not be publishing
[2:07:46.720 --> 2:07:48.920]  a special commemorative edition
[2:07:48.920 --> 2:07:52.000]  that is favorable to Donald Trump if he wins.
[2:07:52.000 --> 2:07:55.240]  And you can learn more right now at infowars.com.

[2:07:59.240 --> 2:08:02.440]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[2:08:02.440 --> 2:08:05.000]  Because of what we did on this day,
[2:08:05.000 --> 2:08:06.560]  change has come to America.
[2:08:06.560 --> 2:08:09.160]  Something's wrong, and we all know it.
[2:08:09.160 --> 2:08:12.080]  I'm Charity Daniels, and I'm here to tell you about it.
[2:08:12.080 --> 2:08:15.560]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces,
[2:08:15.560 --> 2:08:17.800]  bent on global governance.
[2:08:17.800 --> 2:08:21.320]  When I was a boy, it was OK to be proud of the flag.
[2:08:21.320 --> 2:08:24.000]  Heritage, mom and apple pie.
[2:08:24.000 --> 2:08:27.480]  God was in school, morality had a future,
[2:08:27.480 --> 2:08:30.200]  and beef was for supper.
[2:08:30.200 --> 2:08:33.240]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[2:08:33.240 --> 2:08:34.320]  We're the solution.
[2:08:34.320 --> 2:08:36.880]  Americans, ain't nothing more to it than that.
[2:08:36.880 --> 2:08:39.600]  Starring Alex Jones, Charity Daniels,
[2:08:39.600 --> 2:08:42.280]  and Special Ops General Jerry Boykin,

[2:08:44.120 --> 2:08:45.840]  DVDs now available.
[2:08:45.840 --> 2:08:49.360]  Born of sheds and tears over the red, white, and blue.
[2:08:49.360 --> 2:08:52.240]  Revelation, the movie, thought info.
[2:08:52.240 --> 2:08:55.000]  Americans need to see this film.
[2:08:55.000 --> 2:08:57.720]  Revelation, the movie, thought info.
[2:08:57.720 --> 2:08:59.120]  Let's fix it.
[2:08:59.120 --> 2:09:02.360]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.

[2:09:08.880 --> 2:09:11.680]  that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.

[2:09:23.080 --> 2:09:26.440]  zeolites, and others, Deep Cleanse doesn't hold back.
[2:09:26.440 --> 2:09:28.640]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven
[2:09:28.640 --> 2:09:29.960]  different cleansing products,
[2:09:29.960 --> 2:09:32.240]  we use decades-old scientific research
[2:09:32.240 --> 2:09:35.360]  to put together the Rolls Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[2:09:35.360 --> 2:09:37.200]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse
[2:09:37.200 --> 2:09:38.640]  is the only product on the market
[2:09:38.640 --> 2:09:42.440]  that uses our proprietary SpyJurex herbal processing technique.
[2:09:42.440 --> 2:09:44.640]  We use only the highest-quality organic herbs
[2:09:44.640 --> 2:09:46.120]  backed by serious research,
[2:09:46.120 --> 2:09:48.840]  and we still bring it to you at the best price out there.
[2:09:48.840 --> 2:09:50.240]  If you wish to find Deep Cleanse
[2:09:50.240 --> 2:09:52.000]  and experience the all-in-one cleansing,
[2:09:52.000 --> 2:09:53.760]  visit infoworselife.com.
[2:09:53.760 --> 2:09:55.240]  That's infoworselife.com,
[2:09:55.240 --> 2:09:58.320]  or call 888-253-3139.
[2:10:00.040 --> 2:10:08.560]  All the waiting is over.
[2:10:08.560 --> 2:10:11.000]  The time for preparation has passed.
[2:10:11.000 --> 2:10:12.680]  The battle is now.
[2:10:12.680 --> 2:10:15.000]  The fight for not just U.S. sovereignty,
[2:10:15.000 --> 2:10:17.920]  but national sovereignty and human sovereignty
[2:10:17.920 --> 2:10:21.520]  against the scientific dictatorship of the New World Order.
[2:10:21.520 --> 2:10:23.800]  And Donald Trump is our figurehead
[2:10:23.800 --> 2:10:27.280]  in the fight for Americanism, not globalism.
[2:10:27.280 --> 2:10:32.720]  It's now Election Day, Tuesday, November 8th, 2016.
[2:10:32.720 --> 2:10:35.680]  And you're listening to infowors.com,
[2:10:35.680 --> 2:10:38.080]  and ten-year-old live coverage.
[2:10:38.080 --> 2:10:43.440]  Oh, let's get ready to rumble.
[2:10:43.440 --> 2:10:47.600]  In the globalist corner, Hillary Clinton weighing 200 pounds,
[2:10:47.600 --> 2:10:50.280]  sniveling crime boss represents pedophiles,
[2:10:50.280 --> 2:10:51.560]  throwing off the Watergate Committee
[2:10:51.560 --> 2:10:52.800]  for fabricating evidence,
[2:10:52.800 --> 2:10:54.720]  robbing thousands of old people of their homes
[2:10:54.720 --> 2:10:58.400]  in whitewater, cattle futures, murders, Dixie Mafia,
[2:10:58.400 --> 2:11:01.120]  put into office by the KKK.
[2:11:01.120 --> 2:11:03.200]  Yes, and that was just getting started
[2:11:03.200 --> 2:11:04.400]  by the time she hit Washington
[2:11:04.400 --> 2:11:07.160]  that was mass murder, death, wars, corruption.
[2:11:07.160 --> 2:11:10.120]  She even got rid of Glass-Steagall
[2:11:10.120 --> 2:11:12.800]  and created the debt bubble, the derivatives.
[2:11:12.800 --> 2:11:15.680]  It goes on and on, bombing aspirin factories,
[2:11:15.680 --> 2:11:17.400]  half a million dead Iraqi children,
[2:11:17.400 --> 2:11:20.600]  intensifying the illegal sanctions.
[2:11:20.600 --> 2:11:22.120]  And we're only up to 1996.
[2:11:22.120 --> 2:11:23.600]  We better stop right there,
[2:11:23.600 --> 2:11:27.440]  because we only had Gerald Solentic told about 40 after.
[2:11:27.440 --> 2:11:29.280]  Then we have Mark Dice joining us,
[2:11:29.280 --> 2:11:30.800]  popping in his prolific work.
[2:11:30.800 --> 2:11:31.960]  I just get so much more excited
[2:11:31.960 --> 2:11:34.400]  when I see everything Solentic doing going super viral.
[2:11:34.400 --> 2:11:36.080]  I see Mark Dice everywhere.
[2:11:36.080 --> 2:11:37.160]  I'm like in a restaurant.
[2:11:37.160 --> 2:11:38.640]  Somebody's looking at Mark Dice.
[2:11:38.640 --> 2:11:41.760]  I mean, it's so exciting to see liberty
[2:11:41.760 --> 2:11:43.720]  hotter than a flame in coal.
[2:11:43.720 --> 2:11:44.560]  It's a great time to be alive.
[2:11:44.560 --> 2:11:47.000]  Now, speaking of liberty, it's hard to fund this operation.
[2:11:47.000 --> 2:11:48.000]  I didn't even plug last hour.
[2:11:48.000 --> 2:11:51.440]  I should tell you, we have a absolutely biggest sale ever
[2:11:51.440 --> 2:11:53.920]  going right now for Defend the Republic special
[2:11:53.920 --> 2:11:54.760]  running through tomorrow.
[2:11:54.760 --> 2:11:57.760]  Free shipping store, wide, m4warsstore.com,
[2:11:57.760 --> 2:12:00.880]  m4warslife.com takes your right to the supplement area.
[2:12:00.880 --> 2:12:04.360]  30 to 40% off everything that's in the supplement area.
[2:12:04.360 --> 2:12:06.480]  Everything else is 30% off, except for apparel.
[2:12:06.480 --> 2:12:08.320]  That's 50% off all the come and take it,
[2:12:08.320 --> 2:12:09.680]  Molan Lombay stuff.
[2:12:09.680 --> 2:12:10.800]  And we need to fund our operation
[2:12:10.800 --> 2:12:13.120]  because we're real good at giant audiences.
[2:12:13.120 --> 2:12:14.840]  We're not good at money.
[2:12:14.840 --> 2:12:17.560]  I've had top people in here, folks that have been
[2:12:17.560 --> 2:12:19.080]  the tops of major networks, and they say,
[2:12:19.080 --> 2:12:20.640]  listen, you should be making $2 billion a year
[2:12:20.640 --> 2:12:21.720]  with this audience.
[2:12:21.720 --> 2:12:24.360]  Well, we're not making a fraction of that
[2:12:24.360 --> 2:12:26.360]  because it's all corporate.
[2:12:26.360 --> 2:12:27.880]  They prop up the media.
[2:12:27.880 --> 2:12:28.720]  They prop it up.
[2:12:28.720 --> 2:12:29.560]  They fund it.
[2:12:29.560 --> 2:12:31.160]  CNN spends $100 million a year.
[2:12:31.160 --> 2:12:33.680]  MSNBC, 80 something million to run themselves.
[2:12:33.680 --> 2:12:34.520]  It's all a joke.
[2:12:34.520 --> 2:12:35.840]  Then they lose as much money.
[2:12:35.840 --> 2:12:36.680]  We don't do that.
[2:12:36.680 --> 2:12:37.880]  We're in the free market.
[2:12:37.880 --> 2:12:40.000]  So the money we get funds this.
[2:12:40.000 --> 2:12:41.480]  So we sell really great products,
[2:12:41.480 --> 2:12:43.400]  and then it funds the operation.
[2:12:43.400 --> 2:12:46.000]  But 18 million people, as of showtime,
[2:12:46.000 --> 2:12:47.840]  the last 24 hours, just on video streams,
[2:12:47.840 --> 2:12:49.280]  separate from our regular audience,
[2:12:49.280 --> 2:12:51.040]  took me 20-something years to get
[2:12:51.040 --> 2:12:53.440]  four or five million people a day to tune in.
[2:12:53.440 --> 2:12:55.040]  Folks, we just, and I know it's the election,
[2:12:55.040 --> 2:12:56.400]  but it's not going away after.
[2:12:56.400 --> 2:12:58.720]  Mainstream media has destroyed themselves.
[2:12:58.720 --> 2:13:01.160]  Judgereport.com, what Gerald Salente's doing,
[2:13:01.160 --> 2:13:04.200]  TrendsJournal.com, all of it are exploding.
[2:13:04.200 --> 2:13:05.040]  They're dropping.
[2:13:05.040 --> 2:13:06.200]  Even in the midst of the election,
[2:13:06.200 --> 2:13:07.840]  they're going down, we're going up.
[2:13:07.840 --> 2:13:09.960]  They have discredited themselves.
[2:13:09.960 --> 2:13:10.920]  They've blown themselves up.
[2:13:10.920 --> 2:13:11.840]  We're going to Salente in a moment.
[2:13:11.840 --> 2:13:14.360]  But first, this was a little bit behind,
[2:13:14.360 --> 2:13:16.560]  because it was, a lot of big companies
[2:13:16.560 --> 2:13:18.080]  had to get involved, a lot of tech people,
[2:13:18.080 --> 2:13:21.760]  because it was a very, let's just say,
[2:13:23.200 --> 2:13:24.600]  exploratory cutting edge.
[2:13:24.600 --> 2:13:25.760]  It works really good.
[2:13:25.760 --> 2:13:27.200]  The bugs are worked out of it.
[2:13:27.200 --> 2:13:29.240]  We have the free app, infowars.com,
[2:13:29.240 --> 2:13:31.480]  or slash app on Android and iPhone.
[2:13:31.480 --> 2:13:33.440]  What's got video feeds, audio feeds, text feeds?
[2:13:33.440 --> 2:13:34.480]  People say, well, this app's cool,
[2:13:34.480 --> 2:13:35.960]  but he said it's revolutionary.
[2:13:35.960 --> 2:13:37.600]  Now, what's revolutionary is the paid app.
[2:13:37.600 --> 2:13:39.720]  $4.95 a month, we've got to pay for it.
[2:13:39.720 --> 2:13:42.440]  We're going to do upgrades as well.
[2:13:42.440 --> 2:13:44.040]  Myself and all the reporters are going to have
[2:13:44.040 --> 2:13:46.280]  raw feeds, live feeds, special reports,
[2:13:46.280 --> 2:13:48.520]  special events, all my reporters,
[2:13:48.520 --> 2:13:51.080]  and I'm going to start giving the code.
[2:13:51.080 --> 2:13:52.040]  I'm telling you now why I'm on here,
[2:13:52.040 --> 2:13:53.000]  to people like Gerald Salente.
[2:13:53.000 --> 2:13:54.800]  You can put whatever he wants on it.
[2:13:54.800 --> 2:13:57.360]  People I trust, auxiliary reporters, contributors.
[2:13:57.360 --> 2:14:00.440]  It's like it's on YouTube, folks, on our servers.
[2:14:00.440 --> 2:14:01.280]  And we're building them.
[2:14:01.280 --> 2:14:02.480]  It's going to cost money.
[2:14:02.480 --> 2:14:03.960]  That's what the charge is for,
[2:14:03.960 --> 2:14:05.280]  is to pay for the bandwidth.
[2:14:05.280 --> 2:14:07.360]  Because we estimate it's going to cost
[2:14:07.360 --> 2:14:08.720]  hundreds of thousands of dollars a month,
[2:14:08.720 --> 2:14:11.600]  even though we get bandwidth from the same folks Google do.
[2:14:11.600 --> 2:14:14.720]  Still, I'm paying $200, $300,000 a month in bandwidth.
[2:14:14.720 --> 2:14:16.960]  Now, this is probably going to cost more.
[2:14:16.960 --> 2:14:20.120]  So, you're paying for it to get the bandwidth, baby,
[2:14:20.120 --> 2:14:21.120]  not what's in it.
[2:14:23.000 --> 2:14:24.120]  I mean, we could shoot videos all day.
[2:14:24.120 --> 2:14:24.960]  That's not expensive.
[2:14:24.960 --> 2:14:26.320]  That's just overhead the crew.
[2:14:26.320 --> 2:14:28.000]  But it's going to be groundbreaking.
[2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:30.440]  We're going to use this to feed other sites,
[2:14:30.440 --> 2:14:32.880]  prisonplanet.tv, YouTube, you name it.
[2:14:32.880 --> 2:14:34.040]  So if you've been supporters,
[2:14:34.040 --> 2:14:37.600]  now is the time to really come in, $4.95 a month.
[2:14:37.600 --> 2:14:39.880]  It's the same price we get it for a year.
[2:14:39.880 --> 2:14:41.160]  It comes with like 40-something bucks.
[2:14:41.160 --> 2:14:42.760]  That's half off out of the gates,
[2:14:42.760 --> 2:14:46.960]  because I just want millions of people to get the app.
[2:14:46.960 --> 2:14:49.560]  Millions, two million have gotten to the other free app.
[2:14:49.560 --> 2:14:51.200]  Only $400,000 in the new free app,
[2:14:51.200 --> 2:14:52.560]  but this is part of the platform.
[2:14:52.560 --> 2:14:53.640]  But if you have the free app,
[2:14:53.640 --> 2:14:55.120]  infowars.com, forward slash app,
[2:14:55.120 --> 2:14:58.800]  you can go there and you can click on this,
[2:14:58.800 --> 2:15:02.120]  and you can then sign up right there
[2:15:02.120 --> 2:15:04.160]  on the free app as well.
[2:15:04.160 --> 2:15:05.080]  So check that out.
[2:15:05.080 --> 2:15:07.040]  It's called Infowars Prime.
[2:15:07.040 --> 2:15:09.320]  Infowars Prime on the Apple Store,
[2:15:09.320 --> 2:15:11.400]  on the droid store, you name it.
[2:15:11.400 --> 2:15:14.000]  Check it out, infowars.com, forward slash apps.
[2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:16.440]  We found the free app that this is part of the platform,
[2:15:16.440 --> 2:15:19.160]  but it's Infowars Prime, it's like Amazon Prime,
[2:15:19.160 --> 2:15:22.480]  available on the App Store and Google Play.
[2:15:22.480 --> 2:15:24.240]  And we want to see this explode,
[2:15:24.240 --> 2:15:27.520]  because again, I'm going to offer Salente.
[2:15:27.520 --> 2:15:28.440]  It's very easy to use.
[2:15:28.440 --> 2:15:29.480]  He's got tech people.
[2:15:29.480 --> 2:15:30.840]  Hey, you want a simulcast sometimes?
[2:15:30.840 --> 2:15:32.480]  You want to do something on here to our audience?
[2:15:32.480 --> 2:15:33.880]  You want to be part of the ground floor of this?
[2:15:33.880 --> 2:15:37.560]  We'll also later post excerpts on YouTube and Facebook.
[2:15:37.560 --> 2:15:39.240]  Here it is, it's about synergy,
[2:15:39.240 --> 2:15:40.680]  because I just want to build synergy,
[2:15:40.680 --> 2:15:41.760]  and that's what we're going to do with this.
[2:15:41.760 --> 2:15:44.200]  I intend to get hundreds, maybe thousands,
[2:15:44.200 --> 2:15:45.680]  but then there's liability issues.
[2:15:45.680 --> 2:15:47.600]  You trust thousands of people, maybe.
[2:15:47.600 --> 2:15:49.920]  But people we trust, we're going to put on the app
[2:15:49.920 --> 2:15:51.760]  to promote what they're doing and promote freedom.
[2:15:51.760 --> 2:15:53.200]  Now, Gerald's only with us for 20 minutes.
[2:15:53.200 --> 2:15:54.120]  I appreciate his time.
[2:15:54.120 --> 2:15:55.520]  He's a busy man.
[2:15:55.520 --> 2:15:57.720]  He's wearing red, white, and blue from Kingston, New York,
[2:15:57.720 --> 2:15:59.800]  the heart of the Revolutionary War.
[2:15:59.800 --> 2:16:01.960]  You've heard my rant the last five, six minutes.
[2:16:01.960 --> 2:16:04.080]  Where should we start, my friend?
[2:16:04.080 --> 2:16:08.080]  Well, what you said before that Hillary Clinton
[2:16:08.080 --> 2:16:11.920]  and the mainstream media have destroyed themselves.
[2:16:12.880 --> 2:16:14.760]  And that's exactly what has happened.
[2:16:14.760 --> 2:16:17.920]  And again, I want to encourage everyone
[2:16:17.920 --> 2:16:21.040]  to put your money where your mind is
[2:16:21.040 --> 2:16:23.720]  and support info wars,
[2:16:23.720 --> 2:16:25.720]  because what Alex Jones is doing,
[2:16:25.720 --> 2:16:27.320]  at the level that he's doing,
[2:16:27.320 --> 2:16:30.200]  the international coverage that he's getting for doing it,
[2:16:30.200 --> 2:16:31.840]  is unprecedented.
[2:16:31.840 --> 2:16:34.200]  Because that's what this election is about.
[2:16:34.200 --> 2:16:37.720]  It's about disgust to the two-party system.
[2:16:37.720 --> 2:16:38.880]  Here's our forecast.
[2:16:38.880 --> 2:16:40.720]  We don't know who's going to win.
[2:16:40.720 --> 2:16:43.080]  It's up in the air because polling data
[2:16:43.080 --> 2:16:44.800]  isn't what it used to be.
[2:16:44.800 --> 2:16:48.400]  It's very hard now to get a real strong database
[2:16:48.400 --> 2:16:50.000]  and call an election,
[2:16:50.000 --> 2:16:54.120]  because the cell phones, the handhills,
[2:16:54.120 --> 2:16:55.720]  it's a whole different universe.
[2:16:55.720 --> 2:17:00.720]  Having said that, if Hillary Clinton wins,
[2:17:00.720 --> 2:17:05.720]  it's going to usher in a whole new era of politics,
[2:17:07.060 --> 2:17:09.540]  a true populist movement.
[2:17:09.540 --> 2:17:12.740]  And people like info wars and the trends journal
[2:17:12.740 --> 2:17:17.740]  and others are going to be the leaders of this movement.
[2:17:18.100 --> 2:17:20.460]  This, the mainstream media,
[2:17:20.460 --> 2:17:23.780]  when you see with the WikiLeaks that have come out
[2:17:23.780 --> 2:17:26.420]  with the shield Donna Brazil,
[2:17:26.420 --> 2:17:29.300]  you know, that they have on CNN they used to,
[2:17:29.300 --> 2:17:31.620]  getting the questions ahead of time,
[2:17:31.620 --> 2:17:33.180]  or whether it's that other guy,
[2:17:34.300 --> 2:17:38.420]  Hawwood from CNBC, that other little prostitute,
[2:17:38.420 --> 2:17:42.460]  giving, saying he'll give the questions for review
[2:17:42.460 --> 2:17:46.220]  after they write them from politico.com,
[2:17:46.220 --> 2:17:49.780]  one after another, the fixes in,
[2:17:49.780 --> 2:17:51.100]  and they've destroyed themselves.
[2:17:51.100 --> 2:17:52.580]  And she did what criminals always do.
[2:17:52.580 --> 2:17:55.460]  First she lied, then she got caught three times now,
[2:17:55.460 --> 2:17:57.580]  and she finally literally went, I'm proud I did it.
[2:17:57.580 --> 2:17:59.460]  I do it again, just like in a movie,
[2:17:59.460 --> 2:18:01.420]  just like in a court case when they finally get caught,
[2:18:01.420 --> 2:18:03.920]  you bet I killed those kids, you bet I robbed the bank,
[2:18:03.920 --> 2:18:04.760]  I'll do it again.
[2:18:04.760 --> 2:18:07.100]  I mean, they literally follow criminology
[2:18:07.100 --> 2:18:09.260]  and they don't even know it.
[2:18:09.260 --> 2:18:12.360]  So history today is being made.
[2:18:12.360 --> 2:18:14.740]  If Trump wins, the populist movement
[2:18:14.740 --> 2:18:18.860]  will gain unprecedented traction immediately.
[2:18:18.860 --> 2:18:22.060]  If he loses, it'll be a groundswell
[2:18:22.060 --> 2:18:26.300]  that we're forecasting is going to basically eliminate
[2:18:26.300 --> 2:18:29.300]  the Republican party, because they have no one there.
[2:18:29.300 --> 2:18:30.820]  Who do they have?
[2:18:30.820 --> 2:18:35.820]  Mitch McConnell, what's that other guy, Ryan, Paul Ryan.
[2:18:35.820 --> 2:18:37.300]  Who got caught in the WikiLeaks
[2:18:37.300 --> 2:18:39.940]  trying to get Supreme Court jobs for his family?
[2:18:39.940 --> 2:18:42.100]  Yeah, I think he was playing Eddie Munster
[2:18:42.100 --> 2:18:46.740]  before he got, you know, and then you have what?
[2:18:46.740 --> 2:18:50.420]  Lindsey Graham, you have nobody.
[2:18:50.420 --> 2:18:53.660]  What I'm saying is Alex is,
[2:18:53.660 --> 2:18:57.460]  Info Wars is going to be the forerunner
[2:18:57.460 --> 2:19:02.460]  of the new populist movement that we are forecasting
[2:19:02.580 --> 2:19:05.900]  as the top trend, the 2017.
[2:19:05.900 --> 2:19:06.740]  And by the way, let me ask you,
[2:19:06.740 --> 2:19:08.380]  it's not about myself, but it's interesting
[2:19:08.380 --> 2:19:09.780]  just to look at it as a movement for everybody,
[2:19:09.780 --> 2:19:10.940]  because it's our audience, it's you,
[2:19:10.940 --> 2:19:12.900]  everybody's the info where I'm nothing.
[2:19:12.900 --> 2:19:15.620]  I've only talked to Drudge in the last few years.
[2:19:15.620 --> 2:19:17.180]  We'll forward that on email and stuff a few times
[2:19:17.180 --> 2:19:19.860]  and Paul Watson, but don't have a big relationship,
[2:19:19.860 --> 2:19:20.980]  just relationship he listens
[2:19:20.980 --> 2:19:22.620]  and then we kind of communicate with the internet.
[2:19:22.620 --> 2:19:24.500]  He's been here before, we've had dinner.
[2:19:24.500 --> 2:19:26.220]  I had people 10 years ago tell me
[2:19:26.220 --> 2:19:28.140]  the Drudge really likes you, he thinks you're the future.
[2:19:28.140 --> 2:19:30.140]  I had people that know Drudge tell me five years ago,
[2:19:30.140 --> 2:19:31.500]  Drudge thinks you're gonna be the dominant thing
[2:19:31.500 --> 2:19:33.180]  in the world in like five, six years.
[2:19:33.180 --> 2:19:34.020]  It happened.
[2:19:34.020 --> 2:19:36.180]  How the hell did Matt Drudge know all that?
[2:19:36.180 --> 2:19:38.180]  He's obviously smarter than, I'm not kissing his ass,
[2:19:38.180 --> 2:19:40.740]  he's smarter than I am, I didn't see that coming.
[2:19:40.740 --> 2:19:43.660]  It's what you said before.
[2:19:43.660 --> 2:19:48.540]  Hillary Clinton and the media have destroyed themselves.
[2:19:48.540 --> 2:19:50.020]  That's why you can see it coming.
[2:19:50.020 --> 2:19:51.700]  And this has been going on.
[2:19:51.700 --> 2:19:56.700]  The anti-elitist movement never had a voice before.
[2:19:57.260 --> 2:19:59.020]  Donald Trump is that voice.
[2:19:59.020 --> 2:20:01.260]  Whether you agree or disagree with him
[2:20:01.260 --> 2:20:03.140]  and I don't agree with a lot of his policy.
[2:20:03.140 --> 2:20:04.260]  That's why I was telling Ron Paul earlier
[2:20:04.260 --> 2:20:05.500]  and he finally had to halfway agree
[2:20:05.500 --> 2:20:07.020]  and he kind of walk it back a bit.
[2:20:07.020 --> 2:20:08.580]  He's gone, well, I do kind of support Trump
[2:20:08.580 --> 2:20:10.660]  and then he's doing a lot of stuff they hate
[2:20:10.660 --> 2:20:12.580]  and bringing populism in and I'm like, yeah,
[2:20:12.580 --> 2:20:15.460]  so he's not perfect, but man, the groundswell,
[2:20:15.460 --> 2:20:16.780]  this is exciting.
[2:20:16.780 --> 2:20:20.660]  Well, and here's the front page of the New York Times.
[2:20:20.660 --> 2:20:23.220]  Let me see what date this is here.
[2:20:23.220 --> 2:20:27.140]  November 5th, not ancient history,
[2:20:27.140 --> 2:20:29.460]  front page of the New York Times
[2:20:29.460 --> 2:20:32.620]  and right down at the bottom, Alex Jones is mentioned
[2:20:32.620 --> 2:20:34.100]  of this story.
[2:20:34.100 --> 2:20:37.060]  And by the way, a disgusting photo over here
[2:20:37.060 --> 2:20:42.060]  of Hillary Clinton, Beyonce and Jay-Z
[2:20:42.060 --> 2:20:47.060]  and I cannot read the lyrics of Jay-Z on the air
[2:20:47.340 --> 2:20:49.580]  because we would get censored.
[2:20:49.580 --> 2:20:51.860]  But I wanna read you something to show you
[2:20:51.860 --> 2:20:56.580]  how close they are and how in bed they are with each other.
[2:20:56.580 --> 2:20:58.500]  He was at the White House.
[2:20:58.500 --> 2:21:00.420]  What did I do with that one over here?
[2:21:00.420 --> 2:21:04.100]  And again, Trump says the word pussycat in private,
[2:21:04.100 --> 2:21:05.620]  he's the devil incarnate.
[2:21:05.620 --> 2:21:07.620]  They're singing about using cocaine,
[2:21:07.620 --> 2:21:10.100]  raping women with Hillary on stage.
[2:21:10.100 --> 2:21:12.420]  We can't even play it here and that's okay.
[2:21:12.420 --> 2:21:14.100]  It's the disconnect.
[2:21:14.100 --> 2:21:16.820]  And this is what he put in one of his songs
[2:21:16.820 --> 2:21:18.820]  when he was in the White House.
[2:21:18.820 --> 2:21:22.340]  Turbulence, the word starts with an S, I can't say it.
[2:21:23.620 --> 2:21:27.220]  Almost spilled my drink in the White House
[2:21:27.220 --> 2:21:30.500]  with a mink running through that bitch,
[2:21:30.500 --> 2:21:33.300]  like it's my house.
[2:21:33.300 --> 2:21:37.740]  Like it's my house, the arrogance of this boy.
[2:21:37.740 --> 2:21:39.940]  This bad attitude person.
[2:21:39.940 --> 2:21:42.460]  It's the people's house, Jack.
[2:21:42.460 --> 2:21:45.300]  You're only there because you have people
[2:21:45.300 --> 2:21:46.460]  that like your bad-
[2:21:46.460 --> 2:21:49.660]  They're all disconnected, entitled criminals.
[2:21:49.660 --> 2:21:51.660]  We'll be right back with Gerald Salinte,
[2:21:51.660 --> 2:21:52.780]  friendsjournal.com.
[2:21:52.780 --> 2:21:53.900]  I'm Alex Jones.
[2:21:53.900 --> 2:21:55.140]  These are explosive times,
[2:21:55.140 --> 2:21:57.100]  but the Empire will strike back.
[2:21:57.100 --> 2:21:57.940]  Know that.
[2:21:59.340 --> 2:22:01.100]  Hi, my name is Stephen Holstein.
[2:22:01.100 --> 2:22:04.060]  In my 20s, I abused stimulant and anabolic steroids
[2:22:04.060 --> 2:22:05.980]  to the point where my adrenal glands were shot.
[2:22:05.980 --> 2:22:07.540]  I suffered from extreme fatigue
[2:22:07.540 --> 2:22:09.140]  and an inability to handle stress.
[2:22:09.140 --> 2:22:10.180]  For over six years,
[2:22:10.180 --> 2:22:11.700]  I had been taking adrenal supplements,
[2:22:11.700 --> 2:22:15.700]  including herbs, glandulars, vitamin C, and vitamin B5.
[2:22:15.700 --> 2:22:18.100]  All these supplements did was treat the symptoms
[2:22:18.100 --> 2:22:19.700]  and produced only minimal results.
[2:22:19.700 --> 2:22:23.180]  Now, just after one month on Synergy One and ADR Medics,
[2:22:23.180 --> 2:22:25.100]  I truly feel rejuvenated.
[2:22:25.100 --> 2:22:27.500]  I have never felt such relaxation before
[2:22:27.500 --> 2:22:28.980]  from any adrenal supplement,
[2:22:28.980 --> 2:22:31.940]  as I did just 10 minutes after taking ADR Medics.
[2:22:31.940 --> 2:22:34.860]  I then noticed Synergy One made me wake up rested
[2:22:34.860 --> 2:22:36.260]  and with much more energy.
[2:22:36.260 --> 2:22:39.300]  No more hungover, groggy feeling upon arising.
[2:22:39.300 --> 2:22:41.380]  I had almost considered going to another country
[2:22:41.380 --> 2:22:43.460]  for stem cell therapy as the last resort,
[2:22:43.460 --> 2:22:46.500]  but now I truly feel rejuvenated on Synergy One
[2:22:46.500 --> 2:22:47.900]  and ADR Medics.
[2:22:47.900 --> 2:22:50.180]  Success happens with synergistic nutrition.

[2:23:02.260 --> 2:23:04.060]  are very likely to be contaminated
[2:23:04.060 --> 2:23:05.780]  with heavy metals like lead,
[2:23:05.780 --> 2:23:08.220]  disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine,
[2:23:08.220 --> 2:23:10.820]  and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins,
[2:23:10.820 --> 2:23:12.420]  pain meds, and antidepressants.
[2:23:12.420 --> 2:23:14.580]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped
[2:23:14.580 --> 2:23:16.700]  to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.

[2:23:25.460 --> 2:23:29.540]  pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria, and viruses,
[2:23:29.540 --> 2:23:31.620]  all forms of fluoride and much more.

[2:23:58.580 --> 2:24:01.260]  Do you ever wonder what happened?
[2:24:01.260 --> 2:24:03.380]  Change has come to America.
[2:24:03.380 --> 2:24:06.660]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag,
[2:24:06.660 --> 2:24:10.700]  heritage, and beef was for supper.
[2:24:10.700 --> 2:24:13.580]  Revelation, dawn of global government.

[2:25:27.540 --> 2:25:30.300]  Taking turmeric is good, but there's a problem with it.
[2:25:30.300 --> 2:25:32.860]  The active ingredient in turmeric known as curcumin
[2:25:32.860 --> 2:25:34.580]  is poorly absorbed into the cells
[2:25:34.580 --> 2:25:36.180]  due to its large particle size.

[2:26:12.140 --> 2:26:14.900]  Americanism, not globalism.
[2:26:14.900 --> 2:26:16.340]  I was just talking to Nico and Matt and I said,
[2:26:16.340 --> 2:26:18.340]  I love the graphic you do today
[2:26:18.340 --> 2:26:20.620]  with the world map behind us, the American flag.
[2:26:20.620 --> 2:26:22.140]  I don't like just like Fox, just the flag,
[2:26:22.140 --> 2:26:24.100]  like, oh, we're patriots and then they aren't,
[2:26:24.100 --> 2:26:25.700]  in many cases.
[2:26:25.700 --> 2:26:27.420]  I'm not bashing them, it's just a fact.
[2:26:27.420 --> 2:26:29.220]  But that's Trump, that's America.
[2:26:29.220 --> 2:26:31.300]  Americanism, not globalism.
[2:26:31.300 --> 2:26:32.620]  Like, we're not gonna conquer the world
[2:26:32.620 --> 2:26:33.980]  like the British Empire.
[2:26:33.980 --> 2:26:38.980]  Our ideas, our quality is going to be so loved
[2:26:39.340 --> 2:26:41.180]  that it becomes dominant.
[2:26:41.180 --> 2:26:42.780]  And not dominant to control people,
[2:26:42.780 --> 2:26:46.060]  dominant so they adopt it so we can go to other countries
[2:26:46.060 --> 2:26:48.420]  that are just as cool as our nation.
[2:26:48.420 --> 2:26:50.900]  That's what the Renaissance is about.
[2:26:50.900 --> 2:26:52.860]  And the Renaissance, again, comes out of Italy,
[2:26:52.860 --> 2:26:54.300]  it comes out of Western Europe,
[2:26:54.300 --> 2:26:56.860]  it comes through the UK, it comes into the United States.
[2:26:56.860 --> 2:26:59.820]  That's all we're an extension of is Renaissance quality,
[2:26:59.820 --> 2:27:00.980]  demanding quality.
[2:27:00.980 --> 2:27:04.100]  What Giro Salente harps on in all his bestselling books,
[2:27:04.100 --> 2:27:07.060]  some of them top New York Times bestsellers, is that.
[2:27:07.060 --> 2:27:09.060]  You're like, well, how does just demanding quality,
[2:27:09.060 --> 2:27:11.300]  or thinking good of yourself, not being arrogant,
[2:27:11.300 --> 2:27:14.020]  but having respect, how does that transcend?
[2:27:14.020 --> 2:27:16.100]  Well, because people with self-respect
[2:27:16.100 --> 2:27:18.180]  wouldn't put up being lied to in Gruber saying,
[2:27:18.180 --> 2:27:20.620]  thank God you're dumb, Obama cares a screw job.
[2:27:20.620 --> 2:27:22.300]  You'd get angry, you'd do something.
[2:27:22.300 --> 2:27:25.260]  My anger, I've studied history, would be average
[2:27:25.260 --> 2:27:26.500]  a hundred years ago.
[2:27:26.500 --> 2:27:28.460]  Now it's like that guy's really pissed off.
[2:27:28.460 --> 2:27:29.580]  You're damn right I am.
[2:27:29.580 --> 2:27:32.500]  Giro's with us till about 40 after the mark dies
[2:27:32.500 --> 2:27:34.180]  is popping in, big news on Drudge.
[2:27:34.180 --> 2:27:36.060]  PA voters report seeing Trump vote
[2:27:36.060 --> 2:27:37.700]  switched to Clinton before their eyes.
[2:27:37.700 --> 2:27:39.380]  It's happening all over the country.
[2:27:39.380 --> 2:27:40.580]  We broke a lot of that in Texas.
[2:27:40.580 --> 2:27:43.020]  I'm gonna go vote today and cover it as well.
[2:27:43.020 --> 2:27:44.500]  So that's some of the news there.
[2:27:44.500 --> 2:27:45.980]  Giro, what happened?
[2:27:45.980 --> 2:27:47.220]  Because I've really studied this
[2:27:47.220 --> 2:27:49.220]  and I'm going off my research, my gut,
[2:27:49.220 --> 2:27:52.860]  the pre-programming I'm seeing in the news
[2:27:53.780 --> 2:27:56.940]  and they're trying to get us ready for a Trump defeat.
[2:27:56.940 --> 2:27:58.940]  Now they tried to tell us he couldn't win the nomination.
[2:27:58.940 --> 2:28:01.540]  So maybe them getting us ready
[2:28:01.540 --> 2:28:02.620]  doesn't mean they're about to steal it,
[2:28:02.620 --> 2:28:03.540]  but they've done it before.
[2:28:03.540 --> 2:28:05.500]  I mean, if they'll rig everything and rig the questions
[2:28:05.500 --> 2:28:08.380]  and rig the polls and steal the nomination from Sanders,
[2:28:08.380 --> 2:28:10.300]  I mean, obviously, do you agree or disagree?
[2:28:10.300 --> 2:28:11.340]  It's par for the course.
[2:28:11.340 --> 2:28:13.980]  They'll try to steal it, but do they have the power to do it?
[2:28:13.980 --> 2:28:14.980]  So let's look at that.
[2:28:14.980 --> 2:28:17.300]  What happens if they do steal it?
[2:28:17.300 --> 2:28:18.620]  Then what happens if Hillary gets in?
[2:28:18.620 --> 2:28:21.300]  My God, I mean, she's universally loathed.
[2:28:22.540 --> 2:28:24.180]  Well, as I said, if she gets in,
[2:28:24.180 --> 2:28:27.100]  it's going to be the beginning of a new populist movement
[2:28:27.100 --> 2:28:30.140]  like this country's never seen in modern history.
[2:28:30.140 --> 2:28:32.380]  And what you said before, Hillary Clinton,
[2:28:32.380 --> 2:28:35.100]  the mainstream media have destroyed themselves.
[2:28:35.100 --> 2:28:37.220]  I wanna do a little trends research here
[2:28:37.220 --> 2:28:40.540]  just to show you how fixed and rigged the game is.
[2:28:40.540 --> 2:28:42.020]  These are some New York times.
[2:28:42.020 --> 2:28:44.620]  I'm gonna rush through a couple of them very quickly.
[2:28:44.620 --> 2:28:47.980]  Going back to August, setting the stage.
[2:28:47.980 --> 2:28:51.940]  August 12th, Clinton rejects Trump policies
[2:28:51.940 --> 2:28:54.060]  as aiding rich, front page,
[2:28:54.060 --> 2:28:57.100]  nothing negative about Hillary Clinton.
[2:28:57.100 --> 2:29:02.100]  August 13th, Trump's remarks cut into sport and swing states.
[2:29:02.940 --> 2:29:04.980]  Nothing negative about Clinton.
[2:29:05.940 --> 2:29:10.660]  A failing inside mission to tame Trump's tongue,
[2:29:10.660 --> 2:29:13.100]  August 14th, New York times,
[2:29:13.100 --> 2:29:16.820]  front page, nothing negative about Clinton.
[2:29:16.820 --> 2:29:21.100]  Secret ledger in Ukraine list cash for top Trump aid.
[2:29:21.100 --> 2:29:25.140]  August 15th, New York times, front page,
[2:29:25.140 --> 2:29:28.620]  which is why they call themselves the paper of record.
[2:29:28.620 --> 2:29:31.500]  I call them the toilet paper of record
[2:29:31.500 --> 2:29:33.580]  because that's all this is good for.
[2:29:33.580 --> 2:29:36.180]  Anyway, I'll just keep going, but I'm gonna end quickly.
[2:29:37.620 --> 2:29:42.020]  Biden warns Trump is risky to US safety.
[2:29:42.020 --> 2:29:46.140]  Front page, big picture is Joe B.S. Biden,
[2:29:46.140 --> 2:29:47.860]  who's never worked a day in his life
[2:29:47.860 --> 2:29:49.260]  and has been sucking off the public.
[2:29:49.260 --> 2:29:50.100]  You know what?
[2:29:50.100 --> 2:29:51.660]  Meanwhile, the whole world is telling us
[2:29:51.660 --> 2:29:53.260]  and all the experts in our military,
[2:29:53.260 --> 2:29:56.140]  Hillary's the danger, don't put her in.
[2:29:56.140 --> 2:29:57.740]  Exactly, but I'm just showing you
[2:29:57.740 --> 2:30:01.140]  what you said before about how the media
[2:30:01.140 --> 2:30:02.820]  has destroyed itself.
[2:30:02.820 --> 2:30:06.020]  I'm giving you factual evidence.
[2:30:06.020 --> 2:30:08.260]  This is the New York times.
[2:30:08.260 --> 2:30:11.580]  Again, I just went through several days, one in a row.
[2:30:11.580 --> 2:30:13.180]  I'll end after this one.
[2:30:13.180 --> 2:30:17.340]  Trump casinos get break on tax bill under Christie.
[2:30:17.340 --> 2:30:18.980]  This is August 17th.
[2:30:18.980 --> 2:30:21.180]  Now I wanna fast forward.
[2:30:21.180 --> 2:30:26.180]  I wanna go to Monday, November 7th, 2016.
[2:30:32.420 --> 2:30:35.180]  A beautiful picture there of Hillary Clinton,
[2:30:35.180 --> 2:30:39.980]  very wonderfully framed, a nice pump piece for her.
[2:30:39.980 --> 2:30:44.580]  FBI says review clears Clinton an email inquiry.
[2:30:45.500 --> 2:30:48.940]  Below it, the storm below the calm
[2:30:48.940 --> 2:30:53.500]  and inside view of Trump's last stand.
[2:30:53.500 --> 2:30:55.500]  Then we're gonna go to today's.
[2:30:57.020 --> 2:30:59.260]  Look at the difference of the lightness,
[2:30:59.260 --> 2:31:02.100]  the crowd around Hillary Clinton.
[2:31:02.100 --> 2:31:05.060]  Look how dark they frame Donald Trump.
[2:31:05.060 --> 2:31:06.500]  It looks like nothing around him
[2:31:06.500 --> 2:31:08.900]  but a couple of hands sticking up.
[2:31:08.900 --> 2:31:10.140]  What I'm saying to you, Alex.
[2:31:10.140 --> 2:31:12.140]  They're inverting reality.
[2:31:12.140 --> 2:31:16.740]  Yes, and so when you said they've destroyed themselves,
[2:31:16.740 --> 2:31:18.780]  they've lost their credibility.
[2:31:18.780 --> 2:31:20.900]  Of course, they're typing, calling, and prostitutes.
[2:31:20.900 --> 2:31:22.940]  But they've totally, they've gone from being low
[2:31:22.940 --> 2:31:26.220]  to dislike to absolutely being the scum of the earth,
[2:31:26.220 --> 2:31:28.620]  reviled by any thinking person,
[2:31:28.620 --> 2:31:29.980]  including all the real leftists,
[2:31:29.980 --> 2:31:32.060]  like Julian Assange and Bev Harris
[2:31:32.060 --> 2:31:33.940]  and others that are saying they're stealing the election.
[2:31:33.940 --> 2:31:35.700]  They're not gonna let Trump have it.
[2:31:35.700 --> 2:31:37.060]  We'll come back and talk about that.
[2:31:37.060 --> 2:31:40.580]  We're in the middle of the 52-hour live worldwide broadcast,
[2:31:40.580 --> 2:31:42.780]  which is a revolution against the media.
[2:31:42.780 --> 2:31:43.740]  I gotta check the numbers,
[2:31:43.740 --> 2:31:44.900]  but we were 18 million people
[2:31:44.900 --> 2:31:47.180]  that have watched the last 24 hours.
[2:31:47.180 --> 2:31:48.380]  That really hurts the globalists.
[2:31:48.380 --> 2:31:49.540]  Let's have that be a hundred million.
[2:31:49.540 --> 2:31:50.380]  We're on the march.
[2:31:50.380 --> 2:31:52.540]  The Empire's on the run.
[2:31:52.540 --> 2:31:53.860]  We're gonna rub their faces in it.
[2:31:53.860 --> 2:31:55.700]  We're gonna rub their faces in it.
[2:31:55.700 --> 2:31:57.860]  We're gonna be 50 times bigger than them.
[2:31:57.860 --> 2:31:58.700]  Understand?
[2:31:59.660 --> 2:32:01.700]  Joe Biggs here with infowars.com.
[2:32:01.700 --> 2:32:06.300]  You can't review 650,000 new emails in eight days.
[2:32:06.300 --> 2:32:08.380]  Furious Trump blast FBI director
[2:32:08.380 --> 2:32:10.740]  after Houdini Hillary is cleared
[2:32:10.740 --> 2:32:12.820]  over a second email investigation
[2:32:12.820 --> 2:32:16.420]  sparked by Anthony Weiner's teen sexting scandal.
[2:32:16.420 --> 2:32:19.140]  Donald Trump blasted the FBI's director on Sunday night,
[2:32:19.140 --> 2:32:21.220]  telling a crowd of 8,000 people in Michigan
[2:32:21.220 --> 2:32:23.140]  that he rejects the bureau's latest move
[2:32:23.140 --> 2:32:24.660]  to exonerate Hillary Clinton.
[2:32:24.660 --> 2:32:27.220]  FBI chief James Comey told leaders
[2:32:27.220 --> 2:32:28.780]  in Congress hours earlier
[2:32:28.780 --> 2:32:31.540]  that a review of 650,000 emails discovered
[2:32:31.540 --> 2:32:33.460]  on a laptop belonging to Anthony Weiner
[2:32:33.460 --> 2:32:36.500]  had reinforced July 5th decision to let her off the hook.
[2:32:36.500 --> 2:32:39.020]  Right now, she's being protected by rig system,
[2:32:39.020 --> 2:32:39.860]  Donald Trump said.
[2:32:39.860 --> 2:32:42.900]  You can't review 650,000 new emails in eight days.
[2:32:42.900 --> 2:32:43.740]  You just can't do it.
[2:32:43.740 --> 2:32:46.100]  The investigations and her crimes will go on
[2:32:46.100 --> 2:32:48.060]  for a long, long time, Trump said,
[2:32:48.060 --> 2:32:50.420]  in the Detroit suburb of Sterling Heights.
[2:32:50.420 --> 2:32:53.620]  Somebody get James Comey by Agra
[2:32:53.620 --> 2:32:55.460]  because he finished too soon.
[2:32:55.460 --> 2:32:58.540]  This has been Joe Biggs with infowars.com.
[2:32:59.380 --> 2:33:01.420]  Brain force, it's completely different.
[2:33:01.420 --> 2:33:02.620]  Try a bottle of it.
[2:33:02.620 --> 2:33:04.220]  Rob Doe joins us.
[2:33:04.220 --> 2:33:07.340]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[2:33:07.340 --> 2:33:08.420]  Tell us what brain force did.
[2:33:08.420 --> 2:33:09.420]  I'd been working all day.
[2:33:09.420 --> 2:33:11.860]  I took a couple of hours off coaching basketball.
[2:33:11.860 --> 2:33:13.860]  I get in here at 8.30.
[2:33:13.860 --> 2:33:15.220]  I was kind of run down.
[2:33:15.220 --> 2:33:17.100]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it.
[2:33:17.100 --> 2:33:19.420]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[2:33:19.420 --> 2:33:20.860]  I got my bottle of brain force right there.
[2:33:20.860 --> 2:33:23.260]  I popped two of them and about 20 minutes later,
[2:33:23.260 --> 2:33:26.220]  it's like, everything just kind of clears up.
[2:33:26.220 --> 2:33:27.620]  It's got four and a half stars.
[2:33:27.620 --> 2:33:28.900]  People really love it.
[2:33:28.900 --> 2:33:29.740]  Read about it.
[2:33:29.740 --> 2:33:31.260]  Find out why third party
[2:33:31.260 --> 2:33:33.420]  nutraceutical sites give it such high praise
[2:33:33.420 --> 2:33:36.940]  because it really does have the best organic based systems
[2:33:36.940 --> 2:33:38.900]  that will blow your socks off.
[2:33:38.900 --> 2:33:40.420]  I haven't pulled an all nighter like that in a while,
[2:33:40.420 --> 2:33:42.940]  but I probably could not have done it without brain force.
[2:33:42.940 --> 2:33:45.340]  I went home about 6.45 this morning,
[2:33:45.340 --> 2:33:46.580]  took three hours of sleep,
[2:33:46.580 --> 2:33:49.100]  got up, took two more brain force and came in.
[2:33:49.100 --> 2:33:52.660]  You will find brain force and other game changing products
[2:33:52.660 --> 2:33:57.660]  at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[2:33:57.660 --> 2:33:59.900]  Dr. Group, you developed Living Defense for us.
[2:33:59.900 --> 2:34:01.140]  It took you over a year to do it.
[2:34:01.140 --> 2:34:02.260]  Why is this so good?
[2:34:02.260 --> 2:34:05.100]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem
[2:34:05.100 --> 2:34:07.580]  that pretty much scares me the most.
[2:34:07.580 --> 2:34:11.100]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food
[2:34:11.100 --> 2:34:12.820]  and water and beverages in my system,
[2:34:12.820 --> 2:34:16.780]  but right now we're dealing with massive parasites,
[2:34:16.780 --> 2:34:19.300]  which is anything that's harmful to your body
[2:34:19.300 --> 2:34:21.020]  that lives off a host mechanism.
[2:34:21.020 --> 2:34:24.860]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around,
[2:34:24.860 --> 2:34:27.700]  we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[2:34:27.700 --> 2:34:28.740]  These are all parasites.
[2:34:28.740 --> 2:34:30.060]  Tell us about all the stuff that's said.
[2:34:30.060 --> 2:34:31.260]  There's so many things that are in it.
[2:34:31.260 --> 2:34:32.500]  You have the neem in there.
[2:34:32.500 --> 2:34:35.580]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[2:34:35.580 --> 2:34:38.940]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[2:34:38.940 --> 2:34:40.580]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in
[2:34:40.580 --> 2:34:42.100]  because I'm going back on it today.
[2:34:42.100 --> 2:34:43.900]  It just came back in yesterday, Living Defense,
[2:34:43.900 --> 2:34:44.940]  infowarslife.com.
[2:34:44.940 --> 2:34:46.660]  And folks, you can't lose full of stuff
[2:34:46.660 --> 2:34:48.580]  that's great for your body, period.
[2:34:48.580 --> 2:34:51.820]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[2:34:51.820 --> 2:34:54.780]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing and Health
[2:34:54.780 --> 2:34:55.660]  Healing Center.
[2:34:55.660 --> 2:34:56.860]  Thank you so much for all your work
[2:34:56.860 --> 2:34:58.260]  surrounding this great product.
[2:34:59.820 --> 2:35:07.740]  MUSIC
[2:35:07.740 --> 2:35:11.300]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation,
[2:35:11.300 --> 2:35:16.700]  it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:35:16.700 --> 2:35:29.700]  MUSIC
[2:35:29.700 --> 2:35:31.460]  By the way, I got to give it some fun videos.
[2:35:31.460 --> 2:35:33.900]  I've got dozens of them that are really
[2:35:33.900 --> 2:35:35.700]  hardcore and depressing.
[2:35:35.700 --> 2:35:37.700]  But exposing evil is what makes it better.
[2:35:37.700 --> 2:35:39.060]  It's like going to get in a root canal.
[2:35:39.060 --> 2:35:40.780]  You don't want to do it, but it feels better afterwards,
[2:35:40.780 --> 2:35:41.380]  right?
[2:35:41.380 --> 2:35:43.300]  At least a day or two later.
[2:35:43.300 --> 2:35:46.300]  We've got this meme that's been seen.
[2:35:46.300 --> 2:35:47.180]  I don't want to exaggerate.
[2:35:47.180 --> 2:35:48.580]  I added it up the other day just for fun,
[2:35:48.580 --> 2:35:49.900]  because my kids love it.
[2:35:49.900 --> 2:35:52.380]  It's been seen about 14 million times.
[2:35:52.380 --> 2:35:54.700]  One clip of it's been seen nine million times,
[2:35:54.700 --> 2:35:56.180]  and others have been seen four or five million.
[2:35:56.180 --> 2:35:59.620]  But you added up, it's about, I mean, it's climbing.
[2:35:59.620 --> 2:36:00.940]  And it's what the media does.
[2:36:00.940 --> 2:36:02.620]  They take what I say out of context,
[2:36:02.620 --> 2:36:03.580]  and they clip it together.
[2:36:03.580 --> 2:36:06.580]  Gawker and others have done this to hundreds of videos
[2:36:06.580 --> 2:36:06.900]  we've done.
[2:36:06.900 --> 2:36:09.020]  The average video on Gawker alone of me
[2:36:09.020 --> 2:36:10.060]  has about a million views.
[2:36:10.060 --> 2:36:10.940]  And there's just so many of them,
[2:36:10.940 --> 2:36:12.300]  I can't even watch them all.
[2:36:12.300 --> 2:36:14.220]  And they're so disconnected, and I'm
[2:36:14.220 --> 2:36:16.620]  talking about this with Gerald, that they think editing me
[2:36:16.620 --> 2:36:18.900]  together to look funny and stupid
[2:36:18.900 --> 2:36:20.780]  will make no one listen to me, because they're
[2:36:20.780 --> 2:36:22.140]  psychologically inoculating.
[2:36:22.140 --> 2:36:23.660]  And of course, they got sued out of existence
[2:36:23.660 --> 2:36:27.660]  for making stuff up as well, and the whole Kogan thing.
[2:36:27.660 --> 2:36:29.460]  But then I found out in the metrics
[2:36:29.460 --> 2:36:32.860]  that's where we got all this new young audience last year or so
[2:36:32.860 --> 2:36:34.940]  was liberal media lying about us,
[2:36:34.940 --> 2:36:37.820]  and then editing it together, where I was saying Trump's
[2:36:37.820 --> 2:36:41.940]  having sex with goblins, or I'm saying space aliens eat
[2:36:41.940 --> 2:36:43.740]  your brains or whatever.
[2:36:43.740 --> 2:36:45.700]  I mean, I can sit there and talk about, yeah, you see that ad
[2:36:45.700 --> 2:36:48.700]  where they're eating people's brains with a mullin' baller,
[2:36:48.700 --> 2:36:51.220]  well, you can't do that with Alec Baldwin,
[2:36:51.220 --> 2:36:52.660]  because he doesn't have a brain.
[2:36:52.660 --> 2:36:54.620]  They'll just go, aliens are eating your brain
[2:36:54.620 --> 2:36:55.700]  with a mullin' baller.
[2:36:55.700 --> 2:36:57.700]  And they'll just cut to something random, I said.
[2:36:57.700 --> 2:37:01.940]  And people inherently know it's BS, so they come to the show.
[2:37:01.940 --> 2:37:04.100]  Then it becomes this whole entertainment deal
[2:37:04.100 --> 2:37:06.780]  where info wars, and they finally figure this out
[2:37:06.780 --> 2:37:08.660]  in the New York Times, the Washington Post, they go,
[2:37:08.660 --> 2:37:11.380]  we have to tell liberals to stop making memes of him.
[2:37:11.380 --> 2:37:13.620]  Jones figured out this is actually growing a show.
[2:37:13.620 --> 2:37:15.180]  No, I didn't figure it out until you told me.
[2:37:15.180 --> 2:37:17.180]  I just thought it was funny,
[2:37:17.180 --> 2:37:18.380]  because I don't mind being made fun of.
[2:37:18.380 --> 2:37:19.460]  That's what my kids do all day,
[2:37:19.460 --> 2:37:20.900]  and that's entertainment around the house.
[2:37:20.900 --> 2:37:21.860]  You don't make it fun on my hair,
[2:37:21.860 --> 2:37:23.460]  make it fun on my belly, make it fun on me, you know,
[2:37:23.460 --> 2:37:24.780]  everything.
[2:37:24.780 --> 2:37:26.780]  And you're a dad, you enjoy it, it's fun.
[2:37:26.780 --> 2:37:30.020]  So let's go to this clip, because this is just a new video,
[2:37:30.020 --> 2:37:33.220]  it hasn't gone viral yet, of the goblin video,
[2:37:33.220 --> 2:37:34.300]  where I was talking about,
[2:37:34.300 --> 2:37:35.780]  if Trump has to be involved with politicos,
[2:37:35.780 --> 2:37:37.340]  they're like goblins.
[2:37:37.340 --> 2:37:39.100]  As long, if he has to go into a goblin's nest,
[2:37:39.100 --> 2:37:40.380]  that's fine to take him out,
[2:37:40.380 --> 2:37:42.380]  but he just can't marry a goblin.
[2:37:42.380 --> 2:37:44.700]  And it was a metaphysical allegory.
[2:37:44.700 --> 2:37:45.900]  I wasn't actually saying,
[2:37:45.900 --> 2:37:47.860]  I'm worried about him having sex with goblins.
[2:37:47.860 --> 2:37:49.780]  But they put that in a bunch of newspapers,
[2:37:51.100 --> 2:37:52.900]  and then it sent tens of millions of people to us.
[2:37:52.900 --> 2:37:53.780]  So here's the clip.
[2:37:55.260 --> 2:37:57.420]  I don't wanna see him kissing goblins.
[2:37:59.860 --> 2:38:03.060]  And grating goblins in bed with a goblin.
[2:38:03.060 --> 2:38:07.660]  I don't wanna see him kissing goblins in bed with a goblin.
[2:38:07.660 --> 2:38:10.780]  And grating goblins in bed with a goblin.
[2:38:10.780 --> 2:38:15.380]  I don't wanna see him kissing goblins in bed with a goblin.
[2:38:15.380 --> 2:38:18.500]  And grating goblins in bed with a goblin.
[2:38:18.500 --> 2:38:23.580]  I don't wanna see him kissing goblins in bed with a goblin.
[2:38:23.580 --> 2:38:26.860]  In bed with a goblin.
[2:38:26.860 --> 2:38:27.420]  Dump it.
[2:38:27.420 --> 2:38:30.220]  Charging into a goblin's nest of goblin vomit,
[2:38:30.220 --> 2:38:33.180]  swap and learn on it.
[2:38:33.180 --> 2:38:34.860]  Especially up to his anguish.
[2:38:34.860 --> 2:38:37.940]  Trump charging into a goblin's nest of goblin vomit,
[2:38:37.940 --> 2:38:39.140]  swap.
[2:38:39.140 --> 2:38:46.140]  I'm expecting to not get a third swap.
[2:38:46.140 --> 2:38:57.140]  I just want to catch him in bad bad bad bad bad with a goblin.
[2:38:57.140 --> 2:38:58.140]  Bad with a goblin.
[2:38:58.140 --> 2:38:59.140]  Bad with a goblin.
[2:38:59.140 --> 2:39:00.140]  Bad with a goblin.
[2:39:00.140 --> 2:39:01.140]  Bad with a goblin.
[2:39:01.140 --> 2:39:02.140]  Bad with a goblin.
[2:39:02.140 --> 2:39:03.140]  Bad with a goblin.
[2:39:03.140 --> 2:39:04.140]  Bad with a goblin.
[2:39:04.140 --> 2:39:07.540]  Well then they catch the goblins going back to Hillary's HQ but listen listen.
[2:39:07.540 --> 2:39:11.380]  I'll be honest with you that isn't as funny as one of the shorter ones but I'm telling
[2:39:11.380 --> 2:39:14.020]  you how the audience is exploding.
[2:39:14.020 --> 2:39:18.540]  They think they're hurting us with this made up edited stuff with goblins coming out of
[2:39:18.540 --> 2:39:23.140]  my hands and it's edited everybody knows it and it only helps us so Gerald I think there
[2:39:23.140 --> 2:39:26.980]  is a disconnect in the media committing suicide what do you say?
[2:39:26.980 --> 2:39:32.140]  Yes it is what I said when you said Hillary Clinton and the mainstream media have destroyed
[2:39:32.140 --> 2:39:33.140]  themselves.
[2:39:33.140 --> 2:39:40.300]  Here you have a photo of two rappers that with their foul rap with the American flag
[2:39:40.300 --> 2:39:46.540]  behind them and Hillary Clinton they're cheering them on and the media avoids the language
[2:39:46.540 --> 2:39:47.860]  that they use.
[2:39:47.860 --> 2:39:52.260]  I just want to read you one little more thing from Jay-Z's thing when he's talking about
[2:39:52.260 --> 2:39:53.260]  the White House.
[2:39:53.260 --> 2:39:54.260]  Please.
[2:39:54.260 --> 2:39:57.660]  It's a million dollars in it baby.
[2:39:57.660 --> 2:40:05.060]  Hillary swank sitting next to Hillary smelling like dank.
[2:40:05.060 --> 2:40:06.220]  You know what dank is?
[2:40:06.220 --> 2:40:10.500]  Oh my god he's saying Hillary stinks like we all say.
[2:40:10.500 --> 2:40:14.540]  Smelling like dank which is you know it's we.
[2:40:14.540 --> 2:40:20.820]  Presidential pardon name me one nigger out there harder than him I'll wait.
[2:40:20.820 --> 2:40:28.100]  I have to tell you Alex after reading so much of these rap lyrics this is racism.
[2:40:28.100 --> 2:40:30.580]  It's a reverse racism.
[2:40:30.580 --> 2:40:35.820]  We have become inferior under the lines of Jay-Z and others.
[2:40:35.820 --> 2:40:37.820]  Yeah why is he allowed to use the n-word?
[2:40:37.820 --> 2:40:38.820]  I don't want to use it.
[2:40:38.820 --> 2:40:39.820]  Why does he do it?
[2:40:39.820 --> 2:40:47.380]  I'm saying to you this is a reverse racism because if you or I were on this stage let's
[2:40:47.380 --> 2:40:51.500]  say with Donald Trump they would be attacking us.
[2:40:51.500 --> 2:40:57.340]  They would pick up something from me where Selenti you know wow look at him go off.
[2:40:57.340 --> 2:41:03.740]  They would be trying to rip me apart but these people go to the people's house he calls it
[2:41:03.740 --> 2:41:09.340]  his house of course and they talk in disgusting ways.
[2:41:09.340 --> 2:41:13.060]  Well here's the good news Jay-Z looks like his brain's been in the microwave I mean he
[2:41:13.060 --> 2:41:16.180]  looks like he's got the IQ of a lobotomized rat.
[2:41:16.180 --> 2:41:19.860]  I could not read these the language from them.
[2:41:19.860 --> 2:41:20.860]  Just be glad you're not him.
[2:41:20.860 --> 2:41:25.260]  I mean the guy hangs out with satanic priestesses and crabby, it's a total piece of filth.
[2:41:25.260 --> 2:41:26.900]  With Beyonce and the rest.
[2:41:26.900 --> 2:41:33.540]  So if you want to know what's destroying America why don't people start looking at the front
[2:41:33.540 --> 2:41:39.740]  page of the New York Times and calling it for what it is because if any person spoke
[2:41:39.740 --> 2:41:47.740]  that kind of language on your show they would all be going after you and me but they can
[2:41:47.740 --> 2:41:54.660]  get away with it and brag about it at the people's house sitting next to Hillary Swank
[2:41:54.660 --> 2:41:57.980]  smelling like dank.
[2:41:57.980 --> 2:42:01.900]  Gerald Selenti we've only got a minute or two left I hope you'll come back again later
[2:42:01.900 --> 2:42:06.780]  this week on the aftermath of whatever happens but other little jewels that you'd like to
[2:42:06.780 --> 2:42:08.620]  impart to the audience.
[2:42:08.620 --> 2:42:13.620]  Yes what's going on in the equity markets wherever it happens it's only temporary.
[2:42:13.620 --> 2:42:20.060]  It's a global economy it's bigger than a nation of 5% of the world's population.
[2:42:20.060 --> 2:42:24.140]  There's a global recession going on as I said just in the United States.
[2:42:24.140 --> 2:42:27.300]  Notice how they brought the economy down to put Obama in now they're trying to prop it
[2:42:27.300 --> 2:42:31.740]  up to put Hillary in but boy no matter what if Trump gets in or she gets in do you agree
[2:42:31.740 --> 2:42:33.740]  they're getting ready to drop the market.
[2:42:33.740 --> 2:42:40.420]  It is and again just look at the last nine months in the United States our import export
[2:42:40.420 --> 2:42:46.220]  trade is down just in the U.S. 500 billion dollars.
[2:42:46.220 --> 2:42:53.260]  There is no recovery if Hillary gets in Wall Street will cheer because again read the Wiki
[2:42:53.260 --> 2:42:59.420]  leaks how she's a member of the Goldman Sachs gang and why do you think they pay her and
[2:42:59.420 --> 2:43:07.460]  bill $250,000, $300,000 an hour to speak when you could hear them BS the total payoff.
[2:43:07.460 --> 2:43:08.460]  You got it.
[2:43:08.460 --> 2:43:11.540]  I mean it's obvious they just think we're idiots in the corruption and here's the thing
[2:43:11.540 --> 2:43:15.580]  they can have the corruption and rip stuff off if they weren't out to break up our families
[2:43:15.580 --> 2:43:19.740]  and bankrupt our cities and you read the Wiki leaks it's like we've got to keep them hopeless
[2:43:19.740 --> 2:43:23.540]  we've got to keep them dumb and in the dark we've got to destroy all the institutions
[2:43:23.540 --> 2:43:27.900]  you're reading this you're like there we knew this was happening but my god they are
[2:43:27.900 --> 2:43:35.140]  fully embracing actual evil instead of wanting I'm not endorsing this but skimming off the
[2:43:35.140 --> 2:43:39.620]  top of a big fat juicy healthy economy I wouldn't be risking my life fighting people that were
[2:43:39.620 --> 2:43:42.700]  doing that I'd criticize them and you know say hey you're going to grow into something
[2:43:42.700 --> 2:43:47.020]  like Hillary that's why I'd oppose that because boss hog grows into Hillary in a few generations
[2:43:47.020 --> 2:43:53.740]  but we're here with like Nero fiddling as Rome burns and she's a stunted ugly witch looking
[2:43:53.740 --> 2:43:58.260]  with a freaking plastic jack-o'-lantern head it's like what the hell nightmare did this
[2:43:58.260 --> 2:44:03.100]  come out of what parallel universe did you know did this did this thing crawl off from
[2:44:03.100 --> 2:44:09.900]  under a rock again go back to what she said you were talking about global globalization
[2:44:09.900 --> 2:44:15.420]  and the strong anti-global movements she's on your Wiki leaks recording saying that
[2:44:15.420 --> 2:44:20.300]  you know she wants open borders and open trade so what I'm saying to you Alex going back
[2:44:20.300 --> 2:44:27.780]  to should she win tonight it's going to be be the beginning of a historic populist movement
[2:44:27.780 --> 2:44:35.100]  anti-globalization pro-american yeah I totally agree with you and I'm going to make a prediction
[2:44:35.100 --> 2:44:40.300]  here right now I'm not for being Machiavelli I'm not for fighting fire with fire I'm not
[2:44:40.300 --> 2:44:44.540]  for using the ring of Mordor because it turns you into this what you claim you're fighting
[2:44:44.540 --> 2:44:49.780]  but the only way Trump wins is if he has people or other folks cheat like the Democrats are
[2:44:49.780 --> 2:44:55.100]  doing and rig things which they've been caught with Soros by Bev Harris a Democrat a liberal
[2:44:55.100 --> 2:45:00.260]  total credibility the biggest find of her life loading software with a fraction clipping
[2:45:00.260 --> 2:45:07.660]  fraction magic to steal it for her the only way he does win is by having folks you know
[2:45:07.660 --> 2:45:13.620]  out there in certain key battleground states go in and jack with things and I'm not endorsing
[2:45:13.620 --> 2:45:16.460]  that but now I realize what they keep saying the Russians are doing it the Russians are
[2:45:16.460 --> 2:45:21.940]  doing it if if Trump does get a victory by whatever means they're going to contest it
[2:45:21.940 --> 2:45:26.780]  so we're going to have a contested election because Trump will contest her she will contest
[2:45:26.780 --> 2:45:31.780]  him the whole thing the dead people voting all over the place we are sitting on top of
[2:45:31.780 --> 2:45:37.500]  time bomb we think the big news cycle in tonight Gerald I predict it gets crazier tomorrow
[2:45:37.500 --> 2:45:42.660]  I agree with you as I was saying you know we're going into something we've never seen before
[2:45:42.660 --> 2:45:47.460]  and again as you point out this McCarthy ism that they've been throwing out there trying
[2:45:47.460 --> 2:45:52.780]  to associate everything if she avoids every question as they do with the wiki leaks by
[2:45:52.780 --> 2:45:57.900]  blaming it on the Russians blaming everything and again they call it racism if you say some
[2:45:57.900 --> 2:46:02.980]  body that's some color did something bad but what about the racism of just saying everybody's
[2:46:02.980 --> 2:46:07.780]  a Russian agent I mean I have no ties to Russia Russia doesn't isn't doing anything they have
[2:46:07.780 --> 2:46:12.940]  the GDP of you know a smaller country and just and I'm they say in the news as you know
[2:46:12.940 --> 2:46:17.580]  I'm literally a Russian agent did you know that Gerald well you know I'm a Russia today
[2:46:17.580 --> 2:46:22.900]  frequently and so I guess I must be true and by the way they've never since said a word
[2:46:22.900 --> 2:46:28.700]  that I've ever said and unlike the American media which I used to be on all the time but
[2:46:28.700 --> 2:46:33.060]  when they don't want to hear what they don't want to hear they'd rather have a Donna Brazil
[2:46:33.060 --> 2:46:37.900]  shill you gotta and by the way Gerald don't you have a bigger audience now than when you
[2:46:37.900 --> 2:46:42.220]  wouldn't sell out to them five years ago and they banned you oh much bigger yeah so we
[2:46:42.220 --> 2:46:47.580]  don't they're over and now like rotting fruit they've gone from somewhat rotten to totally
[2:46:47.580 --> 2:46:52.300]  rotten they're done they're over Gerald Salente God bless you you're amazing thank you for
[2:46:52.300 --> 2:46:56.420]  having me on and thank you for all that you do no thank you transjournal.com now he's with
[2:46:56.420 --> 2:46:59.300]  us a little bit the next hour that I'll hand the baton to Liam McAdoo my buddy if he wants
[2:46:59.300 --> 2:47:03.420]  to pop in he was just up here change diners and training with some counties literally
[2:47:03.420 --> 2:47:07.780]  looks like he man Castle Greyskull over here I wanted him to come on and like it was his
[2:47:07.780 --> 2:47:13.020]  view almost happened politics but I don't get up here I'm not a politician everybody
[2:47:13.020 --> 2:47:17.580]  knows that I really tell you what I think that's that's my big attribute I see a lot
[2:47:17.580 --> 2:47:21.100]  of stuff it's quite but if my dad sometimes goes did you really need to tell that story
[2:47:21.100 --> 2:47:25.660]  it didn't sound too good I'm gonna tell you the good stuff I'm gonna tell you the bad
[2:47:25.660 --> 2:47:29.740]  stuff I'm gonna tell you what I think about politics I'm gonna be honest I mean obviously
[2:47:29.740 --> 2:47:33.140]  there's no teleprompters here you think I could be on air 10 hours yesterday and have
[2:47:33.140 --> 2:47:38.580]  a freaking teleprompter or have somebody be loading that thing my integrity is my number
[2:47:38.580 --> 2:47:45.780]  one value and people think well that's really rare no no in the old days that's what got
[2:47:45.780 --> 2:47:50.780]  you business and life and the best people and the best family and the best access was
[2:47:50.780 --> 2:47:57.500]  everybody could trust you that's all there is in this world folks is your honor and I
[2:47:57.500 --> 2:48:04.220]  won't break my word for anybody people it's beyond a superstition it is it is I'm not OCD
[2:48:04.220 --> 2:48:09.220]  about the house being clean when I leave or turn the lights out or but I'm OCD folks when
[2:48:09.220 --> 2:48:16.820]  it comes to being honorable and and if we just start rediscovering that and if men just
[2:48:16.820 --> 2:48:23.140]  stop being cowards and rolling over we'll we can return civilization that's the bottom
[2:48:23.140 --> 2:48:31.300]  line and I am so excited with all this happening to know there are people out there like Mark
[2:48:31.300 --> 2:48:39.900]  Dice because I'm at restaurants I'm in checkout counters and my son says all the kids want
[2:48:39.900 --> 2:48:42.540]  to go to school for years at home schools they could be a larger sports thing or a private
[2:48:42.540 --> 2:48:48.500]  school and they're watching Mark Dice they're watching Daddy they're watching Gavin McGuinness
[2:48:48.500 --> 2:48:51.580]  but I go well who do they really like to watch well I like to watch Gavin McGuinness and Mark
[2:48:51.580 --> 2:48:57.140]  Dice and I talk to other people who have kids and it's all over the place and he's got adults
[2:48:57.140 --> 2:49:01.420]  watching too but the point is when you've got kids in public school private school home
[2:49:01.420 --> 2:49:06.300]  school black kids white kids you name it Jesse James's kids Jesse James was in last night
[2:49:06.300 --> 2:49:15.100]  my kids listening that shows we're winning the future and we have a hope now they got
[2:49:15.100 --> 2:49:22.180]  the millennials at the at the schools and they they know they can't get any job with
[2:49:22.180 --> 2:49:25.460]  their degrees so they want another free degree that's like somebody had a lottery ticket
[2:49:25.460 --> 2:49:30.460]  they didn't win that one so they want another one we'd reach out to those folks but as for
[2:49:30.460 --> 2:49:35.780]  the younger generation at least where I'm at they are on fire with what's going on they
[2:49:35.780 --> 2:49:39.380]  see all through it because they've never grown up racist they never heard Daddy or Mommy
[2:49:39.380 --> 2:49:43.540]  say something racist and they're hearing how racist they are and they're just totally
[2:49:43.540 --> 2:49:48.100]  innocent on what the hell you talking about and it's not just the white kids it's across
[2:49:48.100 --> 2:49:53.980]  the board the young kids are just like what we just want to live leave us alone they're
[2:49:53.980 --> 2:49:58.060]  seeing right through it now again Mark Dice is our guest a little bit in the next hour
[2:49:58.060 --> 2:50:00.900]  we're gonna have a Steiner pop in here as well just to give his take I have no idea
[2:50:00.900 --> 2:50:03.140]  what he's even say I was just trying to get him in there I don't even know what's come
[2:50:03.140 --> 2:50:08.500]  in he may come in we've got so much more and we're in the middle of a 52 hour broadcast
[2:50:08.500 --> 2:50:12.740]  we're halfway through it now and listen the only place I've dropped the ball here is plugging
[2:50:12.740 --> 2:50:18.180]  products that fund the operation and on plugging you that are the power I plugged it some and
[2:50:18.180 --> 2:50:23.860]  we had it showtime we haven't checked since then 18 million people on Facebook YouTube
[2:50:23.860 --> 2:50:29.020]  and our own streams conservatively that have logged on and watch a substantive amount they
[2:50:29.020 --> 2:50:32.940]  both got different algorithms but it's it's it's you know the view counts above 18 million
[2:50:32.940 --> 2:50:38.180]  on top of the four or five million we've had for years to the point is is that finally
[2:50:38.180 --> 2:50:43.260]  the Washington Post and finally Austin America states and they went we looked at the numbers
[2:50:43.260 --> 2:50:47.620]  Alex Jones is the biggest thing out there except for Matt Drudge it isn't a pissing contest
[2:50:47.620 --> 2:50:53.220]  I hope Drudge becomes 10 times bigger I hope Mark Dice does when I see Mark Dice going
[2:50:53.220 --> 2:50:57.980]  for big I told him the full time man total commitment you're talented you're smart get
[2:50:57.980 --> 2:51:02.700]  bigger than I am don't in fight just go at the enemy man he's done it he's he's done
[2:51:02.700 --> 2:51:07.020]  it he's broken through everybody's starting to break through who's been fighting and that's
[2:51:07.020 --> 2:51:10.380]  what's so exciting is the major sea changes here no matter what happens with Donald Trump
[2:51:10.380 --> 2:51:14.100]  I'm not here doing some confidence thing of if we lose it's okay let's move forward we
[2:51:14.100 --> 2:51:18.940]  have savaged them let's get this network break it's too important we have blown giant stinking
[2:51:18.940 --> 2:51:24.980]  holes in their entire operation I should be running celebrating like King David naked
[2:51:24.980 --> 2:51:32.060]  in the streets right now okay this is so good this is so big this is so luscious this is
[2:51:32.060 --> 2:51:39.100]  so huge that even Dr. No had to go well I gotta give you know Donald Trump credit and
[2:51:39.100 --> 2:51:44.740]  whether Trump's for real or not which I believe he is he knows the big wave he's riding it's
[2:51:44.740 --> 2:51:50.420]  victory and so I'll be honest I'm on a vacuum alley then we're going to our guest I don't
[2:51:50.420 --> 2:51:53.820]  look at stuff as in justifies the means of cold blood and play all the sides the real
[2:51:53.820 --> 2:51:58.060]  powers is you know creating the wave being the wave we've done that you've done that
[2:51:58.060 --> 2:52:01.740]  the listeners you are the wave that Trump's writing that's just a fact not bragging for
[2:52:01.740 --> 2:52:08.140]  you the true you deserve to know the power you've got that you do have value you're amazing
[2:52:08.140 --> 2:52:12.380]  and you don't need to get the establishment to give you recognition you know we're recognition
[2:52:12.380 --> 2:52:16.020]  to prove that you don't want their approval that's that's that's that's the curse you
[2:52:16.020 --> 2:52:24.700]  don't want but we are now on every front mark dies folks has more viewers a day now because
[2:52:24.700 --> 2:52:30.780]  he's finally doing it full time that MSNBC does I mean three four million views a day
[2:52:30.780 --> 2:52:35.260]  more some days 10 million see this is this is victory right here ladies and gentlemen
[2:52:35.260 --> 2:52:41.260]  and once that paradigm shifts a guy doing it part times kicking their ass we're destroying
[2:52:41.260 --> 2:52:44.740]  them drudge is annihilating them and they can't get us all they won't get us all I know
[2:52:44.740 --> 2:52:50.020]  I'm ranting but mark dice mark dice com author researcher I'm glad you're a smart guy glad
[2:52:50.020 --> 2:52:53.620]  you moved away from books because folks don't read those now and you're just purely you
[2:52:53.620 --> 2:52:58.420]  know doing it spoken word you're kicking their ass great job mark dice com you've heard my
[2:52:58.420 --> 2:53:02.780]  whole rant I can't help but be incredibly positive here I mean I am a primitive like
[2:53:02.780 --> 2:53:07.540]  everybody else I want to see the guy I backed win for that endorphin rush but at a Machiavellian
[2:53:07.540 --> 2:53:11.580]  level if I look at it from that perspective it's better if Hillary gets in steals it
[2:53:11.580 --> 2:53:17.140]  openly the whore media goes from collapsed to negative numbers I mean I mean media has
[2:53:17.140 --> 2:53:22.140]  six percent approval rating how about negative five thousand you know how about how about
[2:53:22.140 --> 2:53:27.820]  the new word the dictionary for betrayal or evil is CNN mark dice your take on the whole
[2:53:27.820 --> 2:53:33.180]  climate right now it's exciting no matter what happens we've seen as you talked about
[2:53:33.180 --> 2:53:37.420]  the mainstream media is totally discredited we have an entire generation the millennials
[2:53:37.420 --> 2:53:43.000]  who myself and many others have pretty much written off have a total awakening or a beginning
[2:53:43.000 --> 2:53:48.540]  of an awakening in the last 90 days right you were written off as trash as their slaves
[2:53:48.540 --> 2:53:52.460]  perhaps they were late bloomers not just the zombie hordes that we had thought that they
[2:53:52.460 --> 2:53:58.060]  were because now every college kid everybody under the age of 30 who traditionally would
[2:53:58.060 --> 2:54:02.780]  have voted for liberal based off of their connection to the brainwashing liberal media
[2:54:02.780 --> 2:54:09.100]  now sees absolutely how corrupt it is through social media through wiki leaks my viewership
[2:54:09.100 --> 2:54:14.860]  has went up six hundred percent just in the last few months and the main check it but
[2:54:14.860 --> 2:54:19.020]  I knew it because I just it's all over the place the mainstream media has ruined the
[2:54:19.020 --> 2:54:25.140]  entire next generation of their potential viewers nobody is going to trust them and
[2:54:25.140 --> 2:54:32.460]  that's why info wars operation has risen in the last five years from a fairly small operation
[2:54:32.460 --> 2:54:37.500]  to say six hundred percent we're up six hundred percent this year you were I mean you went
[2:54:37.500 --> 2:54:42.780]  from a fairly small operation to having correspondence all over the country perhaps really all over
[2:54:42.780 --> 2:54:48.220]  the world breaking news pushing this election I just saw an article from one of your detractors
[2:54:48.220 --> 2:54:52.820]  saying that well we thought that Alex was just a crank but now he's a serious contender
[2:54:52.820 --> 2:54:57.500]  and a force in the Republican Party now and then this election and so regardless of what
[2:54:57.500 --> 2:55:01.860]  happens it's going to take a miracle to get Trump in because we're going against the most
[2:55:01.860 --> 2:55:07.140]  organized criminal enterprise really in the history of the world but we've made such tremendous
[2:55:07.140 --> 2:55:11.700]  progress and again Trump's not perfect he's got some policies and some ideas obviously
[2:55:11.700 --> 2:55:15.860]  that we can't agree with why do they hate him then because he's not out to get us to
[2:55:15.860 --> 2:55:20.980]  concur they know he's not out to screw people he didn't go into satan parties and you know
[2:55:20.980 --> 2:55:25.620]  going down on three-year-old boys for my research he hasn't been to build a burg he hasn't been
[2:55:25.620 --> 2:55:31.540]  to Bohemian Grove and wait until these millennials start realizing the the the previous past
[2:55:31.540 --> 2:55:36.380]  that people like you and I have laid out where they now know about spirit cooking wait until
[2:55:36.380 --> 2:55:39.980]  they find out about the bushes of the Bohemian Grove and the cremation of care and how you
[2:55:39.980 --> 2:55:46.900]  snuck in there 15 16 years ago and got this ritual on tape we're having a whole new generation
[2:55:46.900 --> 2:55:52.860]  the millennials really in the last three months are finally coming of a breaking the matrix
[2:55:52.860 --> 2:55:59.580]  you're breaking the matrix and we're seeing a huge resurgence of conservatism as well we
[2:55:59.580 --> 2:56:03.660]  seen in this whole crowd well that's what I said I'm not that's not high I mean I'm
[2:56:03.660 --> 2:56:08.300]  talking 12 13 14 15 year old 16 year olds right up to college are on fire with everything
[2:56:08.300 --> 2:56:12.220]  we're doing and I'm seen as like the old man that everybody kind of likes but you know
[2:56:12.220 --> 2:56:15.940]  that the seniors watch but like all the really young people are into you and others that
[2:56:15.940 --> 2:56:21.860]  is so exciting that's the demographic the media craves they cannot get them and you
[2:56:21.860 --> 2:56:26.540]  know traditionally this this sort of fight has been dominantly by men but now we're seeing
[2:56:26.540 --> 2:56:30.820]  a whole bunch of women getting involved we've seen people like Tommy Lahren rise up from
[2:56:30.820 --> 2:56:36.660]  nothing to getting 5 million views a day on our Facebook page we've seen a whole new crop
[2:56:36.660 --> 2:56:42.380]  of conservative women you know you've hired some of them millennial Millie and some of
[2:56:42.380 --> 2:56:48.100]  these other people Lauren Southern over over at another network and we see this huge resurgence
[2:56:48.100 --> 2:56:54.660]  of conservatism in this whole new crop of young adults that are finally starting to
[2:56:54.660 --> 2:57:00.780]  see how rigged the system is and so the media the establishment that they've lost the support
[2:57:00.780 --> 2:57:08.820]  of the entire generation of millennials and I don't see how they can possibly get it back
[2:57:08.820 --> 2:57:13.740]  there's no turning back from what they ask my question you look at all these arrogant
[2:57:13.740 --> 2:57:20.020]  politicos caught on wiggie leagues being run by Hillary in the White House just a facade
[2:57:20.020 --> 2:57:23.780]  pretending they hadn't already collapsed now they all know how pathetic they are what do
[2:57:23.780 --> 2:57:28.100]  they do next well Hillary said they're going to shut us down good luck yeah they're going
[2:57:28.100 --> 2:57:34.940]  to move to the Orwellian censorship of branding anyone any of the I just show up at live events
[2:57:34.940 --> 2:57:37.820]  I just show up at live events and we go to the next level of guerrilla information war
[2:57:37.820 --> 2:57:43.500]  which is 10 times more powerful yeah I keep seeing all of the news the Bill Clinton protesters
[2:57:43.500 --> 2:57:48.020]  that you've been inspiring all that's beta testing for next level operations that that's
[2:57:48.020 --> 2:57:54.620]  the culture jamming 101 so you can't they can't stop that so they might be able to shut down
[2:57:54.620 --> 2:58:00.540]  my YouTube channel they might be able to minimize trending topics in manipulation I mean not
[2:58:00.540 --> 2:58:06.380]  only they are I mean they can they do minimize the trending topics determine which hashtags
[2:58:06.380 --> 2:58:10.740]  are going to link to which stories even if they allow them to trend it to try to slant
[2:58:10.740 --> 2:58:18.260]  the coverage but they can't stop the IRL the in real life protesting the culture jamming
[2:58:18.260 --> 2:58:24.940]  now that we have the support in the last really just few months of the entire the majority
[2:58:24.940 --> 2:58:30.500]  of the younger generation you just said it we have to launch the in real life movement
[2:58:30.500 --> 2:58:34.580]  at a thousand times what we've done and the people are that hanging up posters doing things
[2:58:34.580 --> 2:58:39.820]  videotaping and then putting it in cyberspace but only because it's now a mirror we take
[2:58:39.820 --> 2:58:45.060]  the real world and change it mirror and cyber we take over the AI Google system culture
[2:58:45.060 --> 2:58:50.380]  jam the whole thing hack it in a two met operation we're already doing it and they're so scared
[2:58:50.380 --> 2:58:54.260]  I mean if we can't beat these hunchback goblins like Hillary we deserve what we get right
[2:58:54.260 --> 2:59:00.980]  Mark and we're going to wake up as many people as we can as if we go down and that's what's
[2:59:00.980 --> 2:59:05.340]  going to happen depending on what the outcome of this election is even if we have an outcome
[2:59:05.340 --> 2:59:09.780]  today or tomorrow I think it's going to be contested don't you
[2:59:09.780 --> 2:59:14.060]  If Trump wins and he should if there were in a perfect world he would win if there was
[2:59:14.060 --> 2:59:19.780]  no voting manipulation no hacking no voter fraud but if we're able to counter the voter
[2:59:19.780 --> 2:59:24.260]  fraud based off of the establishment they're probably going to contest they would probably
[2:59:24.260 --> 2:59:25.260]  subpoena.
[2:59:25.260 --> 2:59:27.300]  They're going to say the Russians did it stay right there oh yeah they've already admitted
[2:59:27.300 --> 2:59:31.900]  they say a Trump win is the Ruskies no the Democrats won't hack it they've been caught
[2:59:31.900 --> 2:59:35.460]  but the Ruskies hold on Putin is that in order we'll be back with Mark Dyson the fourth hour

[3:02:27.060 --> 3:02:31.540]  that's how this place works no scripting he's just up here hanging out and he also works
[3:02:31.540 --> 3:02:34.940]  with info wars obviously as his drug you in here but we didn't get him an earpiece so
[3:02:34.940 --> 3:02:38.420]  you can hear mark dice who's with us we're gonna be here till the bottom of the hour
[3:02:38.420 --> 3:02:41.940]  when I did an interview with you last week I think we put it out just dealing with how
[3:02:41.940 --> 3:02:46.500]  Tim Kennedy is going to destroy this guy he's going up against if that has an air we're
[3:02:46.500 --> 3:02:50.980]  going to air it today because it was a powerful interview but I think it did air but Shane
[3:02:50.980 --> 3:02:56.900]  so much going on what is your gut I think if Hillary loses she's going to contest and
[3:02:56.900 --> 3:03:00.420]  say it's a Russian plot they've already said that actually it's it's it's it's unbelievable
[3:03:00.420 --> 3:03:04.180]  that clips coming up in the next segment but Trump's going to contest is already been dead
[3:03:04.180 --> 3:03:08.220]  people voting all the fraud coming out in the rest in Colorado and Florida and everywhere
[3:03:08.220 --> 3:03:13.620]  else it's all against Trump so I mean why is it some of the fraud against Hillary because
[3:03:13.620 --> 3:03:16.780]  the Democrats are known as the dirtiest little pieces of crap you can imagine well I was
[3:03:16.780 --> 3:03:21.780]  just talking to David Knight in the hall and he was telling me that like by every metric
[3:03:21.780 --> 3:03:29.500]  Trump is winning I mean you look at the the the speeches he's been given I mean there's
[3:03:29.500 --> 3:03:36.420]  like packed houses and then you got Hillary who's having these little tiny dinky rallies
[3:03:36.420 --> 3:03:42.820]  and she's even got Jay Z and Beyonce LeBron James they advertise it for a week 300 people
[3:03:42.820 --> 3:03:47.620]  showed up I mean to me that's like a visual pull I mean those are in the same cities too
[3:03:47.620 --> 3:03:51.740]  so dude when you you've been retired you had like number one number two songs in the country
[3:03:51.740 --> 3:03:56.340]  charts you've been retired for years you might play once a month and 300 people show up I
[3:03:56.340 --> 3:04:02.500]  mean you know on a good night whatever Stiner stop putting yourself down the point is is
[3:04:02.500 --> 3:04:08.660]  that easy is that this is ridiculous it is I mean I mean how in Cleveland a supposed
[3:04:08.660 --> 3:04:12.980]  liberal city can she not get 300 people and I had that from the intelligence police sending
[3:04:12.980 --> 3:04:16.700]  me pictures and I went check the news it was all these close shots of her and she's got
[3:04:16.700 --> 3:04:23.180]  these these stars that are that would normally like Beyonce would normally fill up you know
[3:04:23.180 --> 3:04:28.340]  60,000 seat venue for a concert that's people paying hundreds of dollars for tickets that's
[3:04:28.340 --> 3:04:32.940]  right so they can't at Bruce recently she had 30,000 people and then when Bruce leaves
[3:04:32.940 --> 3:04:39.020]  then so does the crowd and so she's speaking to like a handful or the dice there was the
[3:04:39.020 --> 3:04:42.940]  bottom of the hour on your shot with myself at Stiner but yeah I mean again isn't that
[3:04:42.940 --> 3:04:49.340]  the real poll that he has on average 20,000 people she has on average 500 yeah I mean
[3:04:49.340 --> 3:04:53.380]  if you look at the polls obviously are rigged I think they've been preparing for the ultimate
[3:04:53.380 --> 3:04:58.980]  steal from the establishment to make it appear as if this was destined that Hillary was going
[3:04:58.980 --> 3:05:04.900]  to win and as we're talking about in the last segment if Trump wins which he would if there
[3:05:04.900 --> 3:05:09.740]  was no fraud no manipulation even despite the clear establishment coordinated media
[3:05:09.740 --> 3:05:14.580]  attacks against him they're going to subpoenas some voting machines or they'll fabricate
[3:05:14.580 --> 3:05:23.140]  some supposed suspicious traffic or hacking attempts that they have now discovered I don't
[3:05:23.140 --> 3:05:26.340]  know what I don't think anybody by the way you're dead on the fact that Homeland Security
[3:05:26.340 --> 3:05:30.740]  announces the Russians are now hacking all this BS and the way they've preset it with
[3:05:30.740 --> 3:05:34.660]  these suddenly she comes out of hiding with these big stage crowds it's to try to push
[3:05:34.660 --> 3:05:41.860]  the illusion she really won yeah and they've also said that if to be aware of like fake
[3:05:41.860 --> 3:05:46.420]  hacking stories so that anything that comes out people are going to assume that it could
[3:05:46.420 --> 3:05:50.100]  be a fake story that's trying to damage her just before the election and then they'll
[3:05:50.100 --> 3:05:56.580]  find out later that it was probably real but it just buys them a little time amazing we're
[3:05:56.580 --> 3:05:59.460]  going to break in a minute dice you're working on much other stuff what about this video we
[3:05:59.460 --> 3:06:04.020]  aired earlier today when Paul Watson was hosting before I came on at 11 a.m. where the majority
[3:06:04.020 --> 3:06:11.300]  of even normal dumb liberals there in in South California Southern California they all hated
[3:06:11.300 --> 3:06:17.060]  Hillary and she's a crook so that just shows they hate her yeah for those familiar with
[3:06:17.060 --> 3:06:21.860]  my man on the street Monday segments that you've been showing for years now it's been very easy
[3:06:21.860 --> 3:06:25.940]  when Obama was in office to get people to sign petitions to do crazy things like repeal the
[3:06:25.940 --> 3:06:30.820]  Bill of Rights and implement all sorts of crazy you know fake legislation that I told them that
[3:06:30.820 --> 3:06:37.060]  the petition would enact but to do it for Hillary Clinton Alex it was almost impossible in fact
[3:06:37.060 --> 3:06:44.740]  several of the videos that I have about Hillary Clinton they were shot in July of 2015 and I
[3:06:44.740 --> 3:06:49.380]  just kept them in the can and then the ones that I shot just a few months ago it was almost
[3:06:49.380 --> 3:06:54.900]  impossible to get people to agree to do anything that I said Hillary wanted to do they would they
[3:06:54.900 --> 3:06:59.300]  would agree to other crazy legislation like taxes stay there stay there this is big this is important
[3:06:59.300 --> 3:07:03.780]  we're read on election day perhaps the biggest election in American history is just days away
[3:07:03.780 --> 3:07:08.100]  we know that in past elections there have been thousands of cases of voter fraud and election
[3:07:08.100 --> 3:07:12.740]  fraud from dead people voting to people registering false identifications to government leaders
[3:07:12.740 --> 3:07:17.060]  providing fast track amnesty to give illegal immigrants votes this is happening right in front
[3:07:17.060 --> 3:07:21.300]  of us now we are seeing the establishment send all its hitmen after the republican nominee
[3:07:21.300 --> 3:07:25.860]  Donald Trump government chills are campaigning for Clinton mainstream news attacking Donald Trump
[3:07:25.860 --> 3:07:30.420]  all day like rabbit hounds rigged polls being broadcast daily to provide the fake optics
[3:07:30.420 --> 3:07:34.420]  that Hillary Clinton is actually winning and to discourage people from voting Trump fake
[3:07:34.420 --> 3:07:39.220]  celebrities endorsing Clinton across all platforms so with all this what are we doing to keep this
[3:07:39.220 --> 3:07:43.700]  election from being stolen what can we do to prevent election fraud I propose that all Donald
[3:07:43.700 --> 3:07:47.780]  Trump supporters wear red on election day on November 8th when you head to the polls to vote
[3:07:47.780 --> 3:07:52.740]  Donald Trump be decked out in red this way just as we dominated in rally turnout we can prove and
[3:07:52.740 --> 3:07:57.380]  provide the optics that we also dominated in voter turnout wear red on election day and make
[3:07:57.380 --> 3:08:03.780]  America great again you know in the coming election no matter who gets in one of the biggest issues
[3:08:03.780 --> 3:08:09.140]  nobody's talking about on the debates or anywhere is the vulnerability of the power grid the potential
[3:08:09.140 --> 3:08:17.140]  for power grid chaos EMP cyber warfare not to mention dangerous weather hurricanes ice storms
[3:08:17.140 --> 3:08:22.020]  all a very real threat to our grid my friends chaos is already here and it's going to get a

[3:11:50.340 --> 3:11:55.300]  credit but i do we do to sit back have a little bit of satisfaction whatever happens with trump
[3:11:55.300 --> 3:11:59.780]  americanism not globalism how we're sold out the chinese how we're screwed the wiki leaks the

[3:12:16.980 --> 3:12:21.140]  because folks need to know they're dumb enough to steal this from trump they really deserve what
[3:12:21.140 --> 3:12:25.940]  happens if they were smart they'll let him win then try to sabotage but let me tell you you look at
[3:12:25.940 --> 3:12:31.300]  that those tottering mental patients bill and hillary those dumb bastards can't help it they're

[3:13:10.420 --> 3:13:15.220]  to six to eight point leads in the in the battlegrounds to surging another three four points
[3:13:15.220 --> 3:13:20.500]  yesterday the word is there's another five point surge about to happen today we're in the middle
[3:13:20.500 --> 3:13:26.180]  of it it's trending two more points already three more points tsunami it makes reagan's landslide
[3:13:26.180 --> 3:13:33.780]  look like a game of part cheesy i mean so what do they do their whole crime syndicate repudiated
[3:13:33.780 --> 3:13:38.340]  it's on info wars dot com shane steiner than mark dice well i mean still you're you're gonna see
[3:13:38.340 --> 3:13:43.460]  that that the polling is going to be extremely close because they've already kind of i think
[3:13:43.460 --> 3:13:48.740]  conditioned us but you know you know you said you didn't want to brag the other day but i think
[3:13:48.740 --> 3:13:54.820]  that you should really take a victory lap because like i remember you doing this in high school and
[3:13:54.820 --> 3:14:00.660]  i mean i saw you from day one talking about this trying to uh you first started trying to open my
[3:14:00.660 --> 3:14:06.260]  eyes and uh man i'll tell you it was such scary stuff to me back then like i i was like that guy
[3:14:06.260 --> 3:14:10.260]  that looks out the window and sees the plane engine on fire and then just shuts the window and
[3:14:10.260 --> 3:14:13.860]  you know tries to pretend like i remember we were a couple classes together and finally we'd
[3:14:13.860 --> 3:14:18.340]  always hang out and talk you know today i'm gonna sit over here alex stop showing me books about
[3:14:18.340 --> 3:14:23.220]  the nazis that are hidden in south america i just want to go out with some girls and i feel
[3:14:23.220 --> 3:14:26.340]  like we're out of barbecues when i read some girls and we talk about you're like alex you're
[3:14:26.340 --> 3:14:30.980]  running the girls off just stop talking about the you know the the the new world order for me it was
[3:14:30.980 --> 3:14:34.580]  scary and you know and people dismissed it because it just i mean and they've been dismissing you for
[3:14:34.580 --> 3:14:39.540]  the longest time because it just sounds so crazy but the more often that you've you know you've been
[3:14:39.540 --> 3:14:44.820]  right and then it's uh and then we've got more people like mark uh mark i'm a huge fan love your
[3:14:44.820 --> 3:14:49.700]  videos oh yeah my personal trainer half the time he trains like four days a week i gotta
[3:14:49.700 --> 3:14:54.500]  dude turn off the mark dice video okay train me you know i'll tell you i still can't figure out if
[3:14:54.500 --> 3:14:59.380]  they're the the most hilarious things i've seen are the scariest i mean it's like i'm laughing and
[3:14:59.380 --> 3:15:03.860]  then i'm i'm just completely mortified and he's not doing this to be mean he's showing what we've
[3:15:03.860 --> 3:15:08.340]  turned into and and this is supposed you're interviewing what's supposed to be the the
[3:15:08.340 --> 3:15:15.140]  intellectuals the the well-informed voter that we all keep hearing about and uh you know the
[3:15:15.140 --> 3:15:21.140]  the people that vote like i do or are the uh non-intellectual uh you know didn't graduate from
[3:15:21.140 --> 3:15:25.620]  high school that kind of stuff but these i mean they don't even know who won the civil war
[3:15:25.620 --> 3:15:29.140]  they don't even know who's in the civil war that was just you know i know about nazis in south
[3:15:29.140 --> 3:15:33.300]  america because my grandfather worked for oil companies was a lease hound a manager and he'd
[3:15:33.300 --> 3:15:37.060]  been in world war two as a fighter pilot mother grandfather was a b-17 pilot they both almost
[3:15:37.060 --> 3:15:41.380]  died in world war two and i remember just hearing i was a little kid going i was out there in new
[3:15:41.380 --> 3:15:47.220]  mexico that federal land lease getting more wells in it god damn nazi talking crap and this whole
[3:15:47.220 --> 3:15:52.420]  boy's where it broke his jaw smart ass germans i'll kill him son of bitches and you know he was
[3:15:52.420 --> 3:15:57.060]  german himself hamming but the whole point was is that and i remember i'm on when he's a little
[3:15:57.060 --> 3:16:01.940]  he's a little eccentric your grandfather but no it was all true and we that's why they finally
[3:16:01.940 --> 3:16:06.260]  shipped them assholes down to south america so i was only telling people everything i heard from
[3:16:06.260 --> 3:16:10.260]  my grandfather but that's why you listen to old folks folks that's they've seen it you know my
[3:16:10.260 --> 3:16:14.340]  mom was nice but she was the young trendy she's like you're he's a little eccentric but you know
[3:16:14.340 --> 3:16:19.140]  it's funny it's like i always thought that i i knew more than my parents and uh you know especially
[3:16:19.140 --> 3:16:23.620]  because i was in school and and uh you know they kind of teach you in school that you know you're
[3:16:23.620 --> 3:16:29.860]  the one that are educated now you're you're smarter than your parents and uh i figured out real quick
[3:16:29.860 --> 3:16:35.060]  that that i will never be smarter than my parents that there's something about just you know putting
[3:16:35.060 --> 3:16:38.660]  in the time you'll be as smart as they were after they're gone but you've hit that plane exactly
[3:16:38.660 --> 3:16:43.940]  like whatever potential smarts you have it just intensifies if you have knowledge exactly uh mark
[3:16:43.940 --> 3:16:49.300]  i'm ranging here go ahead yeah i've done a couple of interviews that are with senior citizens into
[3:16:49.300 --> 3:16:54.820]  contrast the younger generations with the senior citizens and it's astounding to talk to a 70 80
[3:16:54.820 --> 3:17:00.420]  year old 90 year old people sometimes i would bump into on the beach and to contrast their statements
[3:17:00.420 --> 3:17:05.380]  with the younger generations and you know you're right it's horrifying just to see my videos it's
[3:17:05.380 --> 3:17:12.020]  it's depressing uh sometimes but it needed to be shown what these people think or what they don't
[3:17:12.020 --> 3:17:17.060]  think or what they're willing to do and as i was saying before we went to break before to try to
[3:17:17.060 --> 3:17:22.900]  convince people or to just ask them to support crazy legislation that hillary clinton allegedly
[3:17:22.900 --> 3:17:28.500]  proposed you know fake petitions for hillary it was pretty difficult i'll tell you it was it was
[3:17:28.500 --> 3:17:33.140]  almost impossible and two of my petitions for hillary clinton to repeal the bill of rights and
[3:17:33.140 --> 3:17:39.940]  to put carl marx on as her vice presidential running mate those were shot a year ago and so
[3:17:39.940 --> 3:17:44.580]  this was before all the dirt about hillary clinton you've gone out since and you found the same finding
[3:17:45.620 --> 3:17:51.060]  it it was it's very very nobody under 30 out here in the college town and southern california
[3:17:51.060 --> 3:17:55.220]  pacific beach would support hillary clinton and that's why yesterday's video which made the
[3:17:55.220 --> 3:18:00.740]  drudge report and made info wars dot com was me just asking women how come you hate hillary clinton
[3:18:00.740 --> 3:18:06.100]  let's let's just find out let's talk to women we found the same thing in austin so with obama
[3:18:06.100 --> 3:18:09.940]  everybody wants to take on this guilt that white people are bad whatever do it if you want the point
[3:18:09.940 --> 3:18:13.780]  is you know if you do something yourself don't take the guilt but with her i don't think this woman
[3:18:13.780 --> 3:18:17.940]  factors playing especially with women there's something about women that they're meaner to other
[3:18:17.940 --> 3:18:21.620]  women they aren't a man i don't think it's gonna go too well when she tries to claim this i'm you
[3:18:21.620 --> 3:18:27.060]  know i'm with her deal and she's not really a woman she's just an evil she's really the a
[3:18:27.060 --> 3:18:32.900]  character of an evil stepmother in the most horrific horror movie you could possibly imagine
[3:18:32.900 --> 3:18:36.020]  i agree let me ask stoner this question and bring it back to marcus mark's written i don't know five
[3:18:36.020 --> 3:18:40.580]  books on the occult a lot of it just republished books that you know he's added in uh forwards to
[3:18:40.580 --> 3:18:46.740]  on admissions of what they're up to what is this obsession like i never get tired of you know going
[3:18:46.740 --> 3:18:51.460]  out on the boat hanging out drinking beer being with the kids campfire shooting guns with you guys
[3:18:51.460 --> 3:18:56.580]  you know our kids hanging out when do you let go i want to go to a ritual and you know have three
[3:18:56.580 --> 3:19:00.580]  year old kids there and have them drink blood and you know screw them i mean what where the hell does
[3:19:00.580 --> 3:19:06.180]  this come from i mean i like doing all those things too alex uh the the beer drinking in the
[3:19:06.180 --> 3:19:11.460]  yeah on the boat uh like it never gets old why why do these because you're you're you're wealthy
[3:19:11.460 --> 3:19:15.140]  successful guy you know the old families here in texas yourself and your own business you're
[3:19:15.140 --> 3:19:20.500]  successful you don't just go oh i'm rich now i need to go out you know kill kids no that's that's
[3:19:20.500 --> 3:19:25.380]  never occurred to me alec no i know that's what i'm saying i don't know i mean i mean mark dies
[3:19:25.380 --> 3:19:29.380]  where does this come from is what i'm getting at like what's wrong with these people it literally
[3:19:29.380 --> 3:19:35.300]  comes from a spiritual deficiency it comes from satanism and you know i think my most popular
[3:19:35.300 --> 3:19:40.740]  tweet ever i tweeted out after the spirit cooking revelations that i'm now accepting apologies
[3:19:40.740 --> 3:19:45.220]  for those who said i was crazy for saying that the establishment worship satan and it was the most
[3:19:45.220 --> 3:19:50.500]  liked and and retweeted tweet i think that i've ever done because a lot of people who maybe have
[3:19:50.500 --> 3:19:55.940]  written me off or thought that the talk about satanism was just crazy kooky conspiracy stuff
[3:19:55.940 --> 3:19:59.940]  are now starting to take a closer look oh i got the same thing it's like oh my god we live in a
[3:19:59.940 --> 3:20:03.060]  world where alex is always right but but shank i mean getting back to that i mean i bring up
[3:20:03.060 --> 3:20:07.940]  you know i'm not like you're a successful guy your family successful uh that that most people
[3:20:07.940 --> 3:20:12.100]  that are successful are either patriots just want to hire more people create more jobs but
[3:20:12.100 --> 3:20:16.660]  then there's the other little small group mainly liberal rich people that man almost to a person
[3:20:16.660 --> 3:20:24.580]  they're into to to really sadistic stuff illegal stuff devil worship and it's like it's one thing
[3:20:24.580 --> 3:20:30.100]  to be in halloween addresses the devil is a joke but it's another thing to really go do it well i
[3:20:30.100 --> 3:20:35.220]  mean i don't really know that many people that are like that i mean first of all we do okay we're
[3:20:35.220 --> 3:20:40.100]  not like rich by any standards but that's right you don't have any money i'm just i'm just saying
[3:20:40.100 --> 3:20:43.540]  but you know i'm saying you run around in some wealthy circles in the circle and you're not
[3:20:43.540 --> 3:20:49.700]  running into this no in fact i've you know people uh you know the left likes to to say that that people
[3:20:49.700 --> 3:20:53.860]  that are that you're right you just have some of the biggest housing developments in texas and and
[3:20:53.860 --> 3:21:00.180]  and you know not me i didn't and your great-grandma i like the best but i'm just saying that they
[3:21:00.180 --> 3:21:05.060]  they want to make you think that if if you have money that you've stolen that from somebody else
[3:21:05.060 --> 3:21:08.820]  you've done it on somebody else's back no all you do is hire people what all the people that i know
[3:21:08.820 --> 3:21:13.380]  that are wealthy are some of the best people that i know because you don't people don't want to do
[3:21:13.380 --> 3:21:17.780]  business with somebody who keeps screwing them over well that's what i'm saying there's the paradox
[3:21:17.780 --> 3:21:22.260]  of old america old texas where everything is about the fact that you're lucky to get in business
[3:21:22.260 --> 3:21:25.380]  with me because i always do what i say i'm gonna do and i'm and i've got the touch you know the
[3:21:25.380 --> 3:21:29.300]  four-leaf clover touch then there's though all this i'll say east coast people are going east
[3:21:29.300 --> 3:21:35.300]  coast but this globalist east coast skip this break guys scum that are all of you read the wiki
[3:21:35.300 --> 3:21:39.780]  leaks it's like these people are like prolific demons they're just thousands i'm gonna screw this
[3:21:39.780 --> 3:21:44.180]  person rob this person we got little kids coming to the hot tub i love the devil worship i'm on
[3:21:44.180 --> 3:21:49.060]  drinking blood it's like what the hell's wrong i mean i'm like hey let's go out on the lake and
[3:21:49.060 --> 3:21:52.740]  you know get hamburgers well i think it's how about how they've made the money i think that if
[3:21:52.740 --> 3:21:58.180]  you have a business that that makes something or or offer something it's different than if you uh i
[3:21:58.180 --> 3:22:02.740]  don't know if you're like a stock market or a hedge fund guy that doesn't have to be you know that
[3:22:02.740 --> 3:22:06.900]  big of a people person you're just you know that's the thing with trump he's got hotels and he's got
[3:22:06.900 --> 3:22:12.660]  golf courses and he's got a real estate where it's gotta be about quality but with the globalist
[3:22:12.660 --> 3:22:18.100]  it's all just hedge fund made up whereas with you it's you know polo club and horses and restaurants
[3:22:18.100 --> 3:22:23.460]  and uh your your your salary that makes boots and all that world-renowned you know going back 100
[3:22:23.460 --> 3:22:27.860]  years and if i start if i start screwing people over or not giving them what they've paid for
[3:22:27.860 --> 3:22:34.900]  they'll stop doing business with me and you know then you don't you know so it's that old competing
[3:22:34.900 --> 3:22:40.420]  system of honor versus treason that's right and i like the people that i know that are i know some
[3:22:40.420 --> 3:22:46.500]  seriously wealthy people that are like they drive an old pickup truck they're uh i mean they just look
[3:22:46.500 --> 3:22:53.300]  like normal everyday people and they're just good people and and uh you know that idea of the
[3:22:54.020 --> 3:23:01.460]  the top hat monocle wearing rolls royce drive-in rich guy i mean i don't i don't know any of those
[3:23:01.460 --> 3:23:05.940]  well exactly but that's classy people that made their money or like that there are the trashy
[3:23:05.940 --> 3:23:11.620]  ones that's mean lady gaga jay-z hillary and this is a woman anywhere she's at she steals stuff
[3:23:11.620 --> 3:23:19.620]  like you have her in your house she's gonna steal something lady gaga no hillary oh lady gaga is pretty
[3:23:19.620 --> 3:23:26.260]  damn bad as well and she picked the hillary pick the most infamous illuminati puppets to give her
[3:23:26.260 --> 3:23:30.500]  the final push in these last days before the last oh yeah let me ask you about the iconography you're
[3:23:30.500 --> 3:23:34.980]  an expert on that she's clearly wearing a weirdo nazi outfit at hillary's event what is that
[3:23:34.980 --> 3:23:42.340]  you know it's she claims that it's a costume that michael jackson was wearing but it clearly looks
[3:23:42.340 --> 3:23:50.740]  like some sort of a high priestess uh garb and in the final days we saw hillary being promoted by
[3:23:50.740 --> 3:23:57.300]  literally the most infamous insidious satanic servants of hollywood it doesn't get any worse
[3:23:57.300 --> 3:24:05.140]  than lady gaga jay-z and Beyonce jay-z has rapped about raping women and children in some of his songs
[3:24:05.140 --> 3:24:12.420]  he wears allister crowley t-shirts lady gaga has been promoting satanism i mean it doesn't get
[3:24:12.420 --> 3:24:17.460]  more obvious than this especially in light of the spirit cooking revelations and everything
[3:24:17.460 --> 3:24:21.380]  that we've been covering and then you've been covering for decades tying into the bohemian
[3:24:21.380 --> 3:24:29.300]  grove and this luciferian doctrine and i think we may see a christian resurgence just as we did
[3:24:29.300 --> 3:24:35.540]  after the experiment of the 1960s when everybody started realizing that just doing a bunch of drugs
[3:24:35.540 --> 3:24:42.020]  and having open marriages and open relationships on little commie communes isn't the way to be
[3:24:42.020 --> 3:24:47.460]  happy and successful so we saw at least in southern california what was called the jesus movement
[3:24:47.460 --> 3:24:53.060]  uh where we had big pastors like chuck smith not these sell out in televangelist so i'm just talking
[3:24:53.060 --> 3:24:58.020]  about really good quality pastors starting and planting churches the capoe chapeau movement
[3:24:58.020 --> 3:25:03.300]  and so we saw this huge resurgence in the early 70s in southern california after the failed
[3:25:03.860 --> 3:25:09.460]  debauchery of the 1960s and so hopefully we're seeing that again we're seeing the seeds of it
[3:25:09.460 --> 3:25:13.380]  with the late blooming millenials well i totally agree i mean i mean shane and i were never that
[3:25:13.380 --> 3:25:18.580]  wild but i mean shane's like mr churchgoer mr super exercise this guy's like more
[3:25:18.580 --> 3:25:22.980]  straight laced in a Mormon over here and and he's and shane is your life not better than ever
[3:25:23.780 --> 3:25:31.460]  look i uh i definitely sampled both sides and uh and uh when i was out touring i was you know
[3:25:31.460 --> 3:25:36.180]  you remember those days i was uh i was out touring with brad paisley and rasko flask when you got
[3:25:36.180 --> 3:25:39.940]  number one country hits in the nation there's some wild stuff going on and uh wasn't fulfilling
[3:25:39.940 --> 3:25:44.100]  no it was not and that's kind of your god that's had number one number two hits you quit you were
[3:25:44.100 --> 3:25:49.220]  successful but it wasn't fulfilling no you told me that you know that's the thing is when i got to
[3:25:49.220 --> 3:25:55.300]  the point that i always thought that i wanted to be and it just was so empty uh that's kind of when
[3:25:55.300 --> 3:25:59.220]  stuff started going sideways for me and i kind of had a little meltdown but for folks that don't
[3:25:59.220 --> 3:26:02.580]  know i'll call you shane stoner because your family does that i'm knowing that you go by
[3:26:02.580 --> 3:26:06.180]  shane stoner but's tommy shane stoner after your grandpa that's what you're doing over in country
[3:26:06.180 --> 3:26:12.740]  music yeah i went by my full name in a country but i fully think that if i was still out touring
[3:26:12.740 --> 3:26:19.220]  that i probably wouldn't even be alive so i'm much happier now you know not well by the way i
[3:26:19.220 --> 3:26:22.900]  knew mark was going through this few years ago because i went through it about 15 years ago
[3:26:22.900 --> 3:26:26.340]  he was acting kind of bummed out he was kind of getting erratic doing stuff he was you know
[3:26:26.340 --> 3:26:29.780]  being a little aggressive and i'm like i'm some high horse i've been through it myself i called
[3:26:29.780 --> 3:26:33.700]  him up and said listen dude you need to stop worrying i said let me guess you had a bunch of
[3:26:33.700 --> 3:26:37.220]  big tv shows that we're going to do and then they cancelled them on you and now you're feeling
[3:26:37.220 --> 3:26:39.620]  like you didn't make it and you're all bummed out should be in the journey was well how do you know
[3:26:39.620 --> 3:26:44.020]  that i because i've been through it you don't need them go do your own thing you do it because
[3:26:44.020 --> 3:26:48.020]  you love people that's why you've already been successful and don't get manipulated into freaking
[3:26:48.020 --> 3:26:52.260]  out and and and i'm not being patronized because i've been through it mark and you've now experienced
[3:26:52.260 --> 3:26:58.980]  it right slow and steady wins the race and i've i've been in those offices in hollywood literally
[3:26:58.980 --> 3:27:03.620]  oh i forgot they asked you to join lucifer oh yeah this is this is the shame anybody ever
[3:27:03.620 --> 3:27:09.780]  asked you to join lucifer uh i never got that call we've talked about this before for those
[3:27:09.780 --> 3:27:15.300]  tell the story yeah tell the story i've been in the offices of hollywood i've been in cnn in the
[3:27:15.300 --> 3:27:20.260]  most of the major networks they all have even the news networks have offices in hollywood so
[3:27:20.260 --> 3:27:25.380]  i was doing pitches with a well-meaning production company trying to get a show on maybe the history
[3:27:25.380 --> 3:27:29.140]  channel discovery channel and we've been pitched to cnn which is whether you've been on those shows
[3:27:29.140 --> 3:27:33.300]  you've had those shows i've done them too it's just yeah it's a joke and now i literally i i got so
[3:27:33.300 --> 3:27:37.940]  many offers this last six months didn't you notice as soon as you didn't want it i'm not exaggerating
[3:27:37.940 --> 3:27:41.780]  is this is just to show how they're nothing it's not i i don't even get offered anymore i used to
[3:27:41.780 --> 3:27:46.420]  get offered ten reality shows a month and i mean with checks and contracts well you've been offered
[3:27:46.420 --> 3:27:50.900]  yes and and but they wanted you to be an idiot yeah you tell that story i'm not finishing
[3:27:50.900 --> 3:27:55.220]  the sentences we will talk about this but go ahead mark yeah i don't even i don't even really answer
[3:27:55.220 --> 3:27:59.700]  them i mean the last phone call that i took from a big production company wanting to have me host
[3:27:59.700 --> 3:28:04.020]  a show i literally got on the phone and i just ranted i looked in the phone it was like two minutes
[3:28:04.020 --> 3:28:07.620]  i was just telling him all the reasons why i didn't want to work for the mainstream media because
[3:28:07.620 --> 3:28:11.940]  they want you to be somebody else they want to steal who you are and control you it's kind of
[3:28:11.940 --> 3:28:17.060]  like fox news has over two thousand people as consultants and they tell them finally you're
[3:28:17.060 --> 3:28:21.780]  getting paid 50 grand a year on average to come on a couple times a year stop going on Alex Jones
[3:28:21.780 --> 3:28:26.660]  or you're not on fox and the truth is and they go they're not even on fox they're they do it to
[3:28:26.660 --> 3:28:32.020]  control them they control what they wear as well i mean we've seen the transformation of mega and
[3:28:32.020 --> 3:28:35.700]  kelly over the course of the election as they were experimenting with her different looks or
[3:28:35.700 --> 3:28:41.780]  different hairstyles or different eyelash lengths and she has no control over how she does her hair
[3:28:41.780 --> 3:28:46.660]  or what she says they control what's put on the teleprompter you're gonna read it you're
[3:28:46.660 --> 3:28:50.820]  gonna see people who appear to be well meaning they have to read the teleprompter and you can
[3:28:50.820 --> 3:28:56.580]  sort of see it in their face that there is the hand figuratively behind them forcing them to
[3:28:56.580 --> 3:29:01.620]  say what it is that and i just want to say this because it's the opposite of bragging about hollywood
[3:29:01.620 --> 3:29:06.980]  i have been offered now not just medium-sized roles sevens of big movies but big starring roles
[3:29:06.980 --> 3:29:11.060]  and lots of money just to get me off what i'm doing i mean i know that's what they're doing i
[3:29:11.060 --> 3:29:15.060]  mean sure maybe i dig up these moves they don't just do that and it's like the new mel Gibson
[3:29:15.060 --> 3:29:19.540]  movie he's great they licensed it i've even seen it i'm told there's a couple clips and listen to me
[3:29:19.540 --> 3:29:24.340]  on the radio and i haven't seen it the discovery channel shows on my last few years i shoot them
[3:29:24.340 --> 3:29:29.300]  never watch them because it's not about me and it's such a pleasure to go from kind of like
[3:29:29.300 --> 3:29:34.100]  a hollywood and thinking it's something cool to now it's uncool and i don't even want to be associated
[3:29:34.100 --> 3:29:39.380]  with it and now it's all begging begging begging is that not again that shows how we've totally
[3:29:39.380 --> 3:29:44.020]  taken the culture back chain well yeah i mean mark what you were talking about like i literally went
[3:29:44.020 --> 3:29:49.940]  through that i would go and have meetings with the label about what i was wearing uh i had to go
[3:29:49.940 --> 3:29:55.460]  take classes or you know about what to say and interviews and stuff in fact tell them you would
[3:29:55.460 --> 3:29:59.220]  even tell them they would tell you what country you supposedly like tell them like i they would
[3:29:59.220 --> 3:30:04.820]  ask me what what my uh my influences were and i would say aero smith and fleetwood mac and they
[3:30:04.820 --> 3:30:08.020]  go no no no no hey you know they almost cover up the mic and say hey you're supposed to say
[3:30:08.020 --> 3:30:13.620]  hey george jones and you know or something like that you know it's like they don't want you to
[3:30:13.620 --> 3:30:18.740]  tell there was it was uh haggard and jones is what you're supposed to go to oh yeah man i grew up
[3:30:18.740 --> 3:30:23.460]  on haggard and jones and i did i i listened to a lot of haggard and jones but you know when
[3:30:24.500 --> 3:30:30.340]  when you start it was really metallic and trint reserance anybody who you were there i was there
[3:30:30.340 --> 3:30:39.060]  no no i know i was right they're trying to steal the thunder steal you know my viewership my uh
[3:30:39.060 --> 3:30:44.980]  you know my influence now and i mean i just had a brand offer offered me thousands of dollars
[3:30:44.980 --> 3:30:52.980]  to promote this bogus app in order to monitor and and uh sort of identify quote hateful speech
[3:30:52.980 --> 3:30:57.380]  and they wanted me to promote it as if it was free speech it was actually completely the
[3:30:57.380 --> 3:31:02.980]  opt yeah they were wanting you to be opted into their adl program for a few thousand dollars a month
[3:31:03.540 --> 3:31:07.940]  it was a joke and i've seen other popular youtubers promoting it as i had them offer me
[3:31:07.940 --> 3:31:12.820]  ten million dollars six years ago the biggest offer pure cash everything paid for i would be in
[3:31:12.820 --> 3:31:17.380]  new yorker la my choice i was gonna be bigger than russia limbaugh and it was and i just said
[3:31:17.380 --> 3:31:22.260]  and they go they go sir this is ten million dollars and i said fake deal i don't know when
[3:31:22.260 --> 3:31:27.460]  fox offered you some deal to be on on a oh yeah oh yeah man calc come on talk about that they offered
[3:31:27.460 --> 3:31:32.340]  us the contract there was a show every week but you stuck your guns and now you get to celebrate
[3:31:32.340 --> 3:31:37.540]  yeah no i mean and again for for viewers we're not here telling you these stories to say we're big
[3:31:37.540 --> 3:31:43.940]  we're saying they're a joke they're over they're nothing not that we're big it's that they're a
[3:31:43.940 --> 3:31:48.340]  joke i'm gonna say bye it dies on the other side an steiner and leon maggot is coming up and we do

[3:32:05.940 --> 3:32:11.620]  donald trump well that's according to newsweek who reportedly has already issued a special
[3:32:11.620 --> 3:32:17.860]  commemorative edition with hillary on the cover behind the words madame president hillary clinton's
[3:32:17.860 --> 3:32:23.620]  historic journey to the white house they know something we don't dc clothesline reports that

[3:32:29.700 --> 3:32:35.300]  the winner but others think the whole thing might be a hoax newsweek has been asked repeatedly
[3:32:35.300 --> 3:32:41.220]  whether the magazine is real but has failed to respond so far if the issue is indeed a fake
[3:32:41.220 --> 3:32:45.940]  well it's very convincing the one thing we know for sure is that newsweek will not be
[3:32:45.940 --> 3:32:51.780]  publishing a special commemorative edition that is favorable to donald trump if he wins

[3:35:52.500 --> 3:35:58.180]  every level this is the reality we are countering the globalists with americanism not globalism
[3:35:58.180 --> 3:36:02.500]  we're just one small part of it everybody's exploding now we got leon mackey and joe bigs

[3:36:10.660 --> 3:36:17.620]  nightly news at 7 o'clock info wars dot com forward slash show but again it's that they all try to
[3:36:17.620 --> 3:36:22.100]  act all powerful and the tabloids in hollywood and i've been sucked into it too when i was younger
[3:36:22.100 --> 3:36:26.820]  and i'm just saying it's all broken it's all it's all over just pop me or what

[3:36:34.820 --> 3:36:40.100]  i finish up with steiner and the dice well we are getting so many reports of election fraud
[3:36:40.100 --> 3:36:45.540]  going on we're seeing the machines switching people are documenting it on camera and and of
[3:36:45.540 --> 3:36:48.980]  course the media is trying to point out how hey well that's illegal you're not allowed to take
[3:36:48.980 --> 3:36:53.700]  photos of that it's like if the election fraud was happening on the other side they'd be in an
[3:36:53.700 --> 3:36:58.100]  uproar but because it's it's not allowing people you're right i can stop celebrating how the media
[3:36:58.100 --> 3:37:02.020]  is dying and killing themselves to steal it we should be focused on the stealing drugs report
[3:37:02.020 --> 3:37:07.140]  dot com pa voters report seeing trump vote switch to clinton and we have it here in austin i'm about
[3:37:07.140 --> 3:37:12.500]  to go vote after this right now i'm gonna go do a live feed they're telling us that you're not supposed
[3:37:12.500 --> 3:37:17.220]  to film your own deal they've told people we've interviewed in texas this and look at this steiner
[3:37:17.220 --> 3:37:23.620]  report info wars dot com roiders pulls pole showing huge trump surge they put it out showing a huge
[3:37:24.260 --> 3:37:30.180]  trump surge of seven points against hillary they've had them dead heat they pulled the
[3:37:30.180 --> 3:37:34.580]  stanker didn't give a reason why what do you say to that well i was gonna say what she was saying
[3:37:34.580 --> 3:37:39.540]  was how their people are more concerned with getting at their cameras at a polling place
[3:37:39.540 --> 3:37:43.940]  it kind of reminds me of how how they've switched the argument you know they're not looking at what's
[3:37:43.940 --> 3:37:48.500]  in the emails they're they're they're talking about you know they've switched the conversation to who
[3:37:48.500 --> 3:37:54.180]  stole them and how did this get stolen it's kind of like if somebody broke into someone's house and
[3:37:54.180 --> 3:37:58.820]  then found some kidnapped people in there you'd be more concerned with the hey you broke
[3:37:58.820 --> 3:38:01.700]  their cops you didn't have a proper search warrant when you found the 10 kids
[3:38:03.140 --> 3:38:09.140]  no no exactly and and begs what else is coming up because you you've been on top of this uh vote
[3:38:09.140 --> 3:38:13.460]  at info wars dot com the messages the videos are pouring in right now our limited crews trying to
[3:38:13.460 --> 3:38:18.340]  go over it the media has pre-programmed this to say trump's losing tonight clearly he's gonna win
[3:38:18.900 --> 3:38:22.340]  i think we're about to see a contested election we're gonna final comment from mark dice
[3:38:22.340 --> 3:38:25.700]  i mean it's gonna be interesting this uh to see what's gonna happen i mean it's gonna happen at
[3:38:25.700 --> 3:38:30.020]  the polling stations with these machines you know i've got a buddy here locally in austin he was down
[3:38:30.020 --> 3:38:36.180]  at south park meadows actually uh watching that polling station in particular and he has footage
[3:38:36.180 --> 3:38:41.220]  on his facebook page i just saw where there's van after van coming in switching him uh machines in
[3:38:41.220 --> 3:38:45.300]  and out and uh he went over to kind of confront the people and asked him what was going on

[3:40:27.860 --> 3:40:33.700]  we're going to get it closing comments mark dice of mark dice com my friend aiding hillary clinton
[3:40:33.700 --> 3:40:40.180]  won't stop her but voting for donald trump just might and despite the massive election fraud and
[3:40:40.180 --> 3:40:46.900]  the serious organized criminal network that we're going up against that's not a reason to sit around
[3:40:46.900 --> 3:40:53.380]  and do nothing it's a reason to actually get more involved to go and vote to get involved as someone
[3:40:53.380 --> 3:41:00.340]  who can oversee either this or future elections to make sure that if they do steal this we can try
[3:41:00.340 --> 3:41:05.300]  the next time around because we're not going to give up ever we're in this to win it and they're
[3:41:05.300 --> 3:41:10.660]  going to have to take us all down to stop us clearly again this is not being positive it's the truth
[3:41:11.300 --> 3:41:15.700]  we're winning there's all these high school kids and college kids you mentioned one of them
[3:41:15.700 --> 3:41:20.740]  where they have her top video 65 million her average three million talking about the new
[3:41:20.740 --> 3:41:26.340]  world order talking about the fraud i mean there's kids that are about to be bigger than i am
[3:41:26.340 --> 3:41:32.580]  am i pissed i am in ecstasy i and i love seeing mark who didn't just come on the season in the
[3:41:32.580 --> 3:41:37.300]  10 years got a degree you know in media and and and media and most of these kids have a lot of big
[3:41:37.300 --> 3:41:40.660]  hits that's selling books whatever but nothing compared to what he's doing now again it's the
[3:41:40.660 --> 3:41:46.180]  season of victory and that's why they want to censor us so it's so exciting what drudgereport.com
[3:41:46.180 --> 3:41:51.380]  has led the way on ron paul's led the way on it's so exciting so thank you both i'm gonna play this
[3:41:51.380 --> 3:41:55.300]  clip here part of it we're gonna post the whole thing in followers.com and then roger stone's
[3:41:55.300 --> 3:41:59.860]  coming in studio with leon macadam and joe biggs they're on the other studio but they probably
[3:41:59.860 --> 3:42:04.900]  come in here uh but stoner anything else about the selection what does your gut tell you well
[3:42:04.900 --> 3:42:09.700]  after the videos and stuff that i've seen with how they can manipulate the the data in the in the
[3:42:09.700 --> 3:42:15.540]  voting the voting booth fraction magic i mean fractions is the craziest thing the fact that
[3:42:15.540 --> 3:42:19.940]  even exists is uh is scary yeah they're putting the programs on them like oh here's the fraud
[3:42:19.940 --> 3:42:23.460]  program to pre-program the results well there should be no reason that there's a fraction
[3:42:23.460 --> 3:42:29.540]  when when you can't break a vote into into pieces unless you you know want to do percentages
[3:42:29.540 --> 3:42:33.700]  but it's like having a lock on your i know your computer guy's like having a lock on your car
[3:42:33.700 --> 3:42:36.820]  but we decided to have another button you push even if you lock it anybody can open it that's
[3:42:36.820 --> 3:42:41.220]  right like a like a back door but i'll tell you this is the first time in my life that i've ever
[3:42:41.220 --> 3:42:47.780]  voted and was completely uncertain whether or not that would actually count or not that's right
[3:42:47.780 --> 3:42:51.220]  no nobody's doubting this fraud now but before we go i just want to say mark man keep up the
[3:42:51.220 --> 3:42:56.340]  good work and uh hey listen i got a question i've always wanted to ask you sure like at what
[3:42:56.340 --> 3:43:02.420]  like when you're at kind of these questions to or these scenarios like how how do you know that
[3:43:02.420 --> 3:43:07.540]  something is is too absurd or do you just like because i mean i don't think i don't think i
[3:43:07.540 --> 3:43:11.380]  know as long as you say it's for obama i mean is there anything too absurd is there anything
[3:43:11.380 --> 3:43:16.900]  we've never seen where they didn't buy it the only ones that that i just abandoned that were
[3:43:16.900 --> 3:43:22.100]  just taking too long because these are fairly simple to shoot unfortunately were the fake
[3:43:22.100 --> 3:43:27.220]  proposals that hillary clinton allegedly had put forth to try to enact legislation so
[3:43:28.340 --> 3:43:33.540]  it's stunning i can't really think on the top of my head if there's been anyone that was too
[3:43:34.100 --> 3:43:40.020]  too crazy i think maybe putting Beyonce on the twenty dollar bill uh what wasn't was taken a
[3:43:40.020 --> 3:43:43.460]  little bit too long there were some some people that you know thought was a good idea but that one
[3:43:43.460 --> 3:43:47.620]  kind of got a little bit too many chuckles they didn't take it seriously but it's really sad
[3:43:47.620 --> 3:43:51.700]  unfortunately and i've been doing this for for years on a weekly basis people can check them out
[3:43:51.700 --> 3:43:56.180]  on youtube.com slash mark dice i appreciate everybody's support it's it's really great to
[3:43:56.180 --> 3:44:01.060]  be a part of the info wars family and it's it's exciting regardless of what happens i mean we're
[3:44:01.060 --> 3:44:09.620]  seeing our resurgence of patriotism and of reality exactly we're on the march the globalists are on
[3:44:09.620 --> 3:44:14.020]  the run anyway you slice it this is a very exciting time to be alive they're gonna try to rebrand
[3:44:14.020 --> 3:44:19.220]  this and they still from trump that the alt right and Alex Jones discredited republicans
[3:44:19.220 --> 3:44:24.020]  now we have a one-party state we've got to shut down these evil people as Hillary said
[3:44:24.020 --> 3:44:28.740]  we can't have that dangerous talk of dark art well most of the time people like like me and you
[3:44:28.740 --> 3:44:33.860]  and and our friends you know we've we've been the the silent you know we we keep to ourselves we
[3:44:33.860 --> 3:44:40.260]  don't go out in march uh and you know yell at people and tell them to to think like we do
[3:44:40.260 --> 3:44:44.740]  but it's it's good to the point now we're i mean most of the time uh the stuff that you're doing
[3:44:44.740 --> 3:44:50.900]  now mark uh was was done by the left you know uh trying to you know switching around and you're
[3:44:50.900 --> 3:44:54.740]  like one of the one of the few people that are there's a truth when we get involved with the
[3:44:54.740 --> 3:44:59.220]  truth we kick their ass in their lives and it's happening now and they're gonna find out they've
[3:44:59.220 --> 3:45:03.460]  seen nothing i mean how many people do you know that didn't even weren't weren't awake they're
[3:45:03.460 --> 3:45:08.900]  not really pissed a lot of them i mean pretty much everybody that i know there's a friend of mine
[3:45:08.900 --> 3:45:16.020]  is uh now waking up and they're and they're they're pissed and every special force is you know
[3:45:16.020 --> 3:45:20.500]  alex i mean i i saw you as a role model you know 10 years ago and i 12 years ago when i first came
[3:45:20.500 --> 3:45:25.540]  across your show and what's what's really incredible is now i'm seeing you know high school kids even
[3:45:25.540 --> 3:45:30.340]  college kids that are sort of you know looking up to me and wanting to do what i do sort of the way
[3:45:30.340 --> 3:45:36.500]  that i looked up to you and you know sort of follow the trail that you it's a shame reaction i'm really
[3:45:36.500 --> 3:45:41.540]  excited it is it is so as bad as it is and they're definitely still in the election they're trying
[3:45:41.540 --> 3:45:46.180]  and that's just my gut you can see it we're winning folks because them even stealing it
[3:45:46.180 --> 3:45:50.820]  in a Machiavellian way is worse trump gets in there's how to block him they're gonna sabotage him
[3:45:51.780 --> 3:45:56.900]  he's so good though he could probably beat him so i want trump in but i'm saying any road we go down
[3:45:56.900 --> 3:46:02.260]  we are gonna adapt and improvise all right mark dies mark dies calm great job we love you thanks

[3:47:26.580 --> 3:47:29.700]  this because stuff falls to the cracks this was a hot interview they even gave him the headline
[3:47:29.700 --> 3:47:35.780]  i don't think it was ever put up uh i think it was like you know ufc tim kennedy set to destroy

[3:48:08.900 --> 3:48:15.300]  hardcore issues we're winning and i look i shot high i said i want a hundred million over two days
[3:48:15.940 --> 3:48:20.660]  looks like well probably we have 40 million i mean come on but the point is that is still
[3:48:20.660 --> 3:48:28.180]  the giant piss on cnn piss on msnbc and just go look how pathetic you are we're 10 times
[3:48:28.180 --> 3:48:33.140]  bigger than you they already figured it out but it's important they be rubbed in how traitorous
[3:48:33.140 --> 3:48:39.540]  they are so this is all part of routing the enemy we don't want to do it i mean i should
[3:48:39.540 --> 3:48:43.780]  boys younger than them the gas chamber didn't want to do it fold out into them and mad house
[3:48:43.780 --> 3:48:50.580]  young boy here we go so often here in info wars we basically break down and cover things that are
[3:48:50.580 --> 3:48:55.620]  personally happening to us just to share our human experience because it's about getting outside the
[3:48:55.620 --> 3:49:02.260]  corporate media box where the executives of five or six big networks put out the ideas they want
[3:49:02.260 --> 3:49:07.060]  push then everybody regurgitates it that's why you go see hollywood movies and there'll be four or
[3:49:07.060 --> 3:49:11.700]  five movies out with the very same theme where you tune to the nightly news all four networks love
[3:49:11.700 --> 3:49:16.660]  the same story in the same order with the same sponsors we're about getting outside the box
[3:49:16.660 --> 3:49:20.580]  and i went to high school with shane steiner a good friend of mine he got involved with us just
[3:49:20.580 --> 3:49:24.980]  years ago doing some shooting shows and things then he got involved in a bunch of weightlifting
[3:49:24.980 --> 3:49:29.700]  and ufc training separately and then met tim kennedy who i was already a fan of i'm not a big
[3:49:29.700 --> 3:49:33.860]  sports guy but i was following some of the ufc because i've known joe rogan for so long i've
[3:49:33.860 --> 3:49:38.420]  also you know met dana white and others so i am a fan of ufc because it's one man against another
[3:49:38.420 --> 3:49:43.700]  it's a real deal i'm not a huge superfan or expert i just know now i'm really into it
[3:49:43.700 --> 3:49:48.100]  because you got this big fight with tim kennedy coming up shane's been out there in new mexico
[3:49:48.100 --> 3:49:52.340]  at albuquerque training with him so shane just got back up for weeks being out there the fight's
[3:49:52.340 --> 3:49:56.980]  coming up uh here just a week or so shane tell us where the fight's taking place in new york who
[3:49:56.980 --> 3:50:03.140]  he's fighting all right so the the fight is at madison square garden november 12th he's fighting
[3:50:04.100 --> 3:50:09.780]  sugar shot evans who was the former light heavyweight champion this is first time at 185
[3:50:09.780 --> 3:50:16.340]  and uh i gotta be honest just watching tim train and being around him i i feel sorry for this guy
[3:50:16.340 --> 3:50:22.740]  i mean i've been a big fan of reshot evans and i mean tim is gonna just completely destroy him
[3:50:23.300 --> 3:50:28.420]  first time they've ever had ufc in new york it's it's uh it's been a legal it's been a legal in
[3:50:28.420 --> 3:50:36.580]  new york um it was the last the last state holding out against the ufc i mean it's all over the world
[3:50:36.580 --> 3:50:41.860]  now and that's just famously the mafia unboxing they wanted to run that monopoly well it had
[3:50:41.860 --> 3:50:48.740]  something to do with the caterers union which is a massive union and the ufc used its own caterers
[3:50:48.740 --> 3:50:54.180]  in los fagos so there was kind of like a power thing power play but i think they've kind of
[3:50:54.180 --> 3:50:59.460]  worked out their their differences and now it's finally gonna be i gotta tell you shane can already
[3:50:59.460 --> 3:51:06.820]  kick my ass okay but now he's really proven that he beat a girl i'm sorry i'm teasing he didn't
[3:51:06.820 --> 3:51:11.060]  want to do this piece because this but it is it is amazing tell me about tell me about the lady
[3:51:11.060 --> 3:51:29.940]  the former champion that you got to roll with holly home yeah so uh yeah i got to grab with
[3:51:29.940 --> 3:51:35.300]  holly home and uh you know that's just in the in the training room you're not going very hard
[3:51:35.860 --> 3:51:39.460]  for all i know she was taking easy on me uh not all right i wasn't gonna say i've been
[3:51:39.460 --> 3:51:42.500]  now you said you said you were going 40 i know i did not say that you didn't say
[3:51:44.740 --> 3:51:51.540]  she was probably going 40 that's what i meant um but no this is uh this is just you know uh i think
[3:51:51.540 --> 3:51:55.380]  she's one of those she has got her hands on you because she said she was like you come here that's
[3:51:55.380 --> 3:52:01.860]  not what happened that's not what happened uh there was everybody else was already had paired
[3:52:01.860 --> 3:52:07.060]  up with partners and i guess she saw that i was lonely walking around in love with you look at her
[3:52:07.060 --> 3:52:13.940]  no she's very nice look she's married i'm married that's not even a no we all know what
[3:52:13.940 --> 3:52:20.340]  went on there i somehow i knew that you're gonna make this weird out i kind of have some fun
[3:52:23.220 --> 3:52:29.140]  she's gonna she's gonna really seriously regret asking me to uh to grapple with her but oh super
[3:52:29.140 --> 3:52:36.260]  looking girl though deals to say you she defeated you oh yeah uh easily um so she's very nice uh super
[3:52:36.260 --> 3:52:44.580]  strong very technical she's also like a multi-time uh boxing world champion she's got her i've seen
[3:52:44.580 --> 3:52:48.660]  her all over tv i physically like her build i think that's a real feminine build i hate these
[3:52:48.660 --> 3:52:55.540]  old chicken you know super skinny women yes she's uh but she actually fights at 135 so she you know
[3:52:55.540 --> 3:53:02.100]  she's cutting a lot of weight also but it's uh yeah she's how did it end we have the footage of that
[3:53:02.100 --> 3:53:09.220]  um it kind of just went on like that for about five minutes and then the buzzer and we you know
[3:53:09.220 --> 3:53:15.620]  shook hands and went on hey look the whole time i was just i i was like thinking on stuff i cannot
[3:53:15.620 --> 3:53:19.860]  believe i'm getting to grapple with holly home that's we can have a match with like 10 of the top
[3:53:19.860 --> 3:53:24.980]  females attack 10 that'd be good yeah that would uh that still wouldn't work out you could have 10
[3:53:24.980 --> 3:53:30.660]  of the top males come attack tim uh we can't just put women in front line combat
[3:53:33.300 --> 3:53:39.620]  uh i mean but you can't have a baby so it's not like it's not like like somebody's unequal
[3:53:39.620 --> 3:53:43.620]  it's like women can do things we can't do that's you know and there's listen i think there's a lot
[3:53:43.620 --> 3:53:49.060]  of things that that women do better i mean i think women make great pilots and race car drivers and
[3:53:49.060 --> 3:53:56.500]  uh especially race car drivers because um i raced in a race one time in in LA and uh
[3:53:56.500 --> 3:54:02.100]  with jesse james with jesse james yeah we're all talking about that and uh all the female drivers
[3:54:02.100 --> 3:54:09.380]  i realized didn't have that that ego that that uh testosterone that made them do stupid things
[3:54:09.380 --> 3:54:14.900]  like i ended up smashing my car into a wall that it was undriveable by the end of the the race but
[3:54:14.900 --> 3:54:21.780]  uh the girls kind of kept their cool and and uh that's why the girls women also make great shooters
[3:54:21.780 --> 3:54:26.500]  yes i know that like in the olympics there there's women shooters like in the biathlon and stuff
[3:54:26.500 --> 3:54:32.420]  like that they do really well but i don't i don't know any uh any case but i'm getting serious i i
[3:54:32.420 --> 3:54:36.900]  can't go out for special forces most men can't it's a very small percentage of men that can't
[3:54:36.900 --> 3:54:39.700]  and then we try to claim we're going to make women in there they're trying to lower the standards
[3:54:39.700 --> 3:54:45.220]  i think that's where this all goes yes there's men that that that have trained for this and really
[3:54:45.220 --> 3:54:51.620]  want to be in special forces and then they can't get in but it's somebody that that doesn't do as
[3:54:51.620 --> 3:54:56.660]  well as they do can kind of leapfrog and get ahead it's i think it puts everybody in danger
[3:54:57.620 --> 3:55:04.100]  just like we don't see women in the nfl but we also don't see men having babies well it's like
[3:55:04.100 --> 3:55:12.020]  the olympics there's there's different uh the women and men don't run together it's because the you
[3:55:12.020 --> 3:55:18.260]  know i it's just like feather weights don't fight heavy weights that's right it's not that you're
[3:55:18.260 --> 3:55:23.140]  bad because you're small or bad because you're big that's your class just watching tim though
[3:55:23.140 --> 3:55:28.260]  and his energy i mean it really is spiritual it's gut level he's able to do all these special
[3:55:28.260 --> 3:55:33.140]  missions and all sorts of clandestine stuff while he hosts hunting hitler and while he hosts
[3:55:33.140 --> 3:55:38.500]  major sports shows on tv and while he trains and fights in the biggest fights it really is exciting
[3:55:38.500 --> 3:55:43.060]  and and look knowing you big jock in high school better shapes than i was you kind of got out of
[3:55:43.060 --> 3:55:46.820]  for a while see you get back into it in fact i just run back into you four or five years ago
[3:55:46.820 --> 3:55:52.420]  we started getting back in the sports and now you're like you know top one percent what happened
[3:55:52.420 --> 3:55:58.340]  shame well i thought i knew what training was until i met him and all these things are explaining
[3:55:58.340 --> 3:56:04.740]  how he does all this stuff he just he made me feel like i didn't do anything so uh he made me
[3:56:04.740 --> 3:56:12.500]  really step up my training and i was only working out one day a week with him so it took me almost
[3:56:12.500 --> 3:56:16.900]  a week to recover from those workouts and then i started working out twice a week and then three
[3:56:16.900 --> 3:56:23.700]  times a week and now we worked out while i was there in albuquerque three to four times a day
[3:56:23.700 --> 3:56:29.700]  and we didn't take sunday off and to be clear what what you've been working with him three and a half
[3:56:29.700 --> 3:56:33.220]  years about three and a half years yeah he tells me now though that you can work out harder than him
[3:56:33.220 --> 3:56:38.020]  a lot of days he says you're really learning fast well i'm learning fast but he's been doing this
[3:56:38.580 --> 3:56:45.140]  since he's been a kid you know uh probably 20 years he's been grappling and i've been doing it maybe
[3:56:46.580 --> 3:56:50.260]  two and a half years three well why have you guys hit it off so good of course we've hit it off as
[3:56:50.260 --> 3:56:56.660]  well he's a big part of the show well he's he's like one of us i mean uh he's the way he thinks
[3:56:56.660 --> 3:57:04.660]  about the world we have the same interests um he's all about liberty and and uh not having people
[3:57:04.660 --> 3:57:09.860]  tell you how to take care of your family and uh real libertarian minded wow see in the footage
[3:57:09.860 --> 3:57:13.540]  just tell us here like a month ago we went on the boat stuff he leaves albuquerque he has lost so
[3:57:13.540 --> 3:57:18.100]  much weight man i guess he went down a weight division yeah so he fights at 185 he normally
[3:57:18.100 --> 3:57:25.140]  walks around about 220 um and by the way there's not much fat on him at 220 no no i mean he's at
[3:57:25.140 --> 3:57:32.100]  eight percent body fat anyway right now he like his face he looks different um he's probably about
[3:57:32.100 --> 3:57:37.060]  five percent body fat right now i can't even imagine but he still flings people around like he's
[3:57:37.860 --> 3:57:46.260]  220 pounds him is like john wane for real i mean it's crazy they even admit the sport that nobody
[3:57:46.260 --> 3:57:50.900]  works out harder than he does and that's why they keep testing him because that's what hard work
[3:57:51.540 --> 3:57:57.860]  does to you so uh the u.s. anti-doping agency came in started testing these u.s.c. athletes and
[3:57:57.860 --> 3:58:05.540]  there's all these memes about before and after pictures and 99 percent of the athletes that
[3:58:05.540 --> 3:58:10.740]  were looking really ripped do not look ripped anymore and so it's clear that something is
[3:58:10.740 --> 3:58:16.900]  different before and after the testing tim is like one of the few people that looks better now
[3:58:17.460 --> 3:58:24.180]  because he he knows now that that those guys are on his same playing field and he has stepped up
[3:58:24.180 --> 3:58:30.340]  the training he's and nobody nobody trains harder than tim i remember getting up and looking at his
[3:58:30.340 --> 3:58:34.820]  facebook a few months ago and they tested him like four times one week and they're my products
[3:58:34.820 --> 3:58:38.580]  he's not just getting tested they're looking at him for his live products that our scientists
[3:58:38.580 --> 3:58:42.580]  developed not me they're the experts and there they are with supermail vitality other stuff you
[3:58:42.580 --> 3:58:46.260]  know double checking and all so he's taking our supplements which is so cool well that's the thing
[3:58:46.260 --> 3:58:50.420]  when they come and test you they want to know everything that you put in your body and so he
[3:58:50.420 --> 3:58:56.180]  gets it all out and supermail vitality is one of them and they write it down and make sure that
[3:58:56.180 --> 3:58:59.700]  it's all good what does he say to you about supermail vitality because that's one of our flagship
