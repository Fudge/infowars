[00:00.000 --> 00:24.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that the Democrats are trying to cause a civil
[00:24.000 --> 00:25.000]  war in this country.
[00:25.000 --> 00:26.000]  In fact, I forgot.
[00:26.000 --> 00:29.560]  Can we print that article from earlier this year when we got the secret Soros documents
[00:29.560 --> 00:34.360]  they later confirmed were real, but they tried to cause martial law in 2015, working
[00:34.360 --> 00:38.560]  in blue cities with the police to have anti-fustage attacks and try to get the general public
[00:38.560 --> 00:43.280]  to burn down cities, show that Obama could declare a civil emergency, it even admits
[00:43.280 --> 00:44.280]  all that.
[00:44.280 --> 00:45.280]  Please print me that article.
[00:45.280 --> 00:51.400]  That was a Soros document show planned to cause civil unrest and martial law.
[00:51.400 --> 00:52.400]  There it is.
[00:52.400 --> 00:56.320]  Document details planned for civil unrest and martial law in Baltimore to then be spread
[00:56.320 --> 01:02.060]  nationwide, then they plan to have the UN come in under the Strong Cities Initiative
[01:02.060 --> 01:06.360]  run by then Attorney General Loretta Lynch and have the local police departments go
[01:06.360 --> 01:08.720]  under UN control.
[01:08.720 --> 01:13.080]  And remember, back then a couple years ago the UN was running the refugee program and
[01:13.080 --> 01:15.680]  telling the State Department who to let in.
[01:15.680 --> 01:22.520]  So it sounds crazy, but that's how arrogant and out of control these people are and they're
[01:22.520 --> 01:28.840]  shooting for the moon, they're throwing Hail Marys, but from their experience it works,
[01:28.840 --> 01:30.640]  so why not do it?
[01:30.640 --> 01:33.040]  Now why am I saying that?
[01:33.040 --> 01:39.120]  Clearly the Democrats are doing this whole hysterical hoax, hissy fit about the illegal
[01:39.120 --> 01:48.240]  aliens' children being held in shelters, that's what they are, and comparing it to Nazi Germany
[01:48.240 --> 01:53.320]  as a talking point coming directly out of the deep state, out of Brennan, out of Clapper,
[01:53.320 --> 01:54.320]  out of Hayden.
[01:54.320 --> 01:58.280]  They started all this, they're the people that are the shadow government, McCain has
[01:58.280 --> 02:04.520]  been the head of the shadow government, but he's on death's doorstep, kind of a interesting
[02:04.520 --> 02:08.080]  omen to where their deep state's going.
[02:08.080 --> 02:12.120]  And so you've had this going on since the times of Eisenhower, but the official law
[02:12.120 --> 02:15.160]  was passed back when George W. Bush was first in office.
[02:15.160 --> 02:18.920]  Obama continued it till his last few years, and then he just started letting everybody
[02:18.920 --> 02:20.720]  in and not even checking them.
[02:20.720 --> 02:24.320]  It didn't matter if they had TB, it didn't matter if they had scabies, it didn't matter
[02:24.320 --> 02:29.000]  what they had, leprosy, you name it, yeah, leprosy came back to the U.S., thousands
[02:29.000 --> 02:34.040]  of cases now, in public schools in California, Texas, and Florida, they tried to cover it
[02:34.040 --> 02:36.200]  up, but it's in the news.
[02:36.200 --> 02:40.960]  And he would just let different charities that were certified by the Democrats, that
[02:40.960 --> 02:46.040]  just means be a Democrat donor, load kids in vans, trucks, cars, buses, and just disappear
[02:46.040 --> 02:47.040]  them.
[02:47.040 --> 02:52.960]  And it came out in the Washington Post that many of them were then sex trafficked, headline.
[02:52.960 --> 02:59.240]  Children, migrant children released an Obama's program, ended up in sex trafficking, headline.
[02:59.240 --> 03:01.200]  Washington Post last year.
[03:01.200 --> 03:04.680]  So Trump says, we're not doing that, we're going back to the law unless they change the
[03:04.680 --> 03:09.840]  law and have a new system for this, we can either totally release people, or we can
[03:09.840 --> 03:13.760]  hold them and take some average two days to vet them, you have no idea who these groups
[03:13.760 --> 03:17.200]  of people are, sometimes thousands of them at a time, usually 20, 30 at a time.
[03:17.200 --> 03:22.160]  And there's no discussion of the hundreds of thousands that die in Mexico being fed
[03:22.160 --> 03:26.720]  on by the smuggling gangs, hundreds of thousands, they find mass graves everywhere, that's a
[03:26.720 --> 03:31.440]  mainline number, the fact that 80% of the women are raped on their way up here, not
[03:31.440 --> 03:36.120]  in the U.S., but Mexico, oh no, Mexico is perfect, Trump is a monster, and those are
[03:36.120 --> 03:41.000]  the headlines, the New York Daily News, the little girl crying, Trump is heartless, Trump
[03:41.000 --> 03:46.520]  is cold, Trump is evil, Trump is a monster, he's craven, oh my gosh, and they show a photo
[03:46.520 --> 03:50.640]  of the cute little girl, just like the little girl washed up dead on the beach, and then
[03:50.640 --> 03:56.880]  say, gotta open the borders to Europe, when it's Soros bringing them across from Libya,
[03:56.880 --> 04:00.960]  it's not Soros' fault, he brings them across, they hit some high waves, a kid falls out
[04:00.960 --> 04:05.440]  and dies, no, it's Europe's fault, and the same thing, these people come across by the
[04:05.440 --> 04:09.240]  millions, and they're bringing their children in some cases, and we don't know who these
[04:09.240 --> 04:13.400]  people are, okay, well, we check your ID's or find your ID's, make sure you're not a,
[04:13.400 --> 04:16.680]  you know, it's probably been deported already five times, you're not an arsonist, a rapist,
[04:16.680 --> 04:23.720]  a pedophile, a criminal, we are going to hold you while we find out what's going on, just
[04:23.720 --> 04:27.920]  like when you're flying in from another country, and even you're a citizen, you get checked,
[04:27.920 --> 04:32.960]  they are spinning all that now, with Rachel Maddow crying, and all this insanity, trying
[04:32.960 --> 04:39.200]  to push insurrection in this country, but also trying to distract, it's such bad acting,
[04:39.200 --> 04:43.080]  it's like junior high, acting level, like seventh grade acting level, and she wouldn't
[04:43.080 --> 04:47.680]  even get an award for this in seventh grade, to distract from their treason and the deep
[04:47.680 --> 04:52.320]  state crimes, they are panicking, now we come back, Hollywood's calling for more violence
[04:52.320 --> 05:00.680]  and the kidnap of the president's son, and his rape at the hands of pedos.

[06:13.840 --> 06:23.240]  Jones show.
[06:23.240 --> 06:26.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Democrats are desperate.
[06:26.240 --> 06:29.200]  Their whole deep state plan has been blown wide open.
[06:29.200 --> 06:32.520]  We are getting control back over the federal government, the country is turning around
[06:32.520 --> 06:33.520]  on every front.
[06:33.520 --> 06:39.120]  Poll numbers show that Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, but Black Americans, particularly,
[06:39.120 --> 06:44.400]  are seeing massive increases of support for the president and his Make America Great Again
[06:44.400 --> 06:46.000]  Americana agenda.
[06:46.000 --> 06:49.200]  So, what are they going to do?
[06:49.200 --> 06:50.200]  Thank you.
[06:50.200 --> 06:51.200]  Brought me a coffee.
[06:51.200 --> 06:52.200]  I forgot my coffee.
[06:52.200 --> 06:54.080]  What are they going to do?
[06:54.080 --> 07:00.720]  They know that as libertarians, as Christians, as patriots, as conservatives, we have a conscience
[07:00.720 --> 07:01.880]  and we care about children.
[07:01.880 --> 07:04.560]  You know, we're the ones that don't want to abort them.
[07:04.560 --> 07:09.120]  We're the ones that don't want the EU banning people from being able to have disabled children
[07:09.120 --> 07:15.480]  and forcibly abort all of the Down's syndrome children.
[07:15.480 --> 07:18.680]  It's the Democrats that are the eugenicists, it's the Democrats that are the social engineers.
[07:18.680 --> 07:22.800]  They're the ones that say, we want the case for killing granny, cover a news week.
[07:22.800 --> 07:29.520]  They're the ones that say, kill one old lady and hire 10 teachers in a zero-sum game, a
[07:29.520 --> 07:30.520]  win-lose game.
[07:30.520 --> 07:36.320]  They're the ones that get up there and want government-funded assisted suicide, but at
[07:36.320 --> 07:43.760]  the same time, they don't want someone who's terminally ill to have access to an experimental
[07:43.760 --> 07:48.080]  drug or treatment that might save them, but will certainly help do studies that will save
[07:48.080 --> 07:49.720]  others in the future.
[07:49.720 --> 07:50.720]  Why is that?
[07:50.720 --> 07:51.720]  Oh, no, no, no.
[07:51.720 --> 07:54.960]  We don't want to extend your life even though it's your choice and you're dying, but if
[07:54.960 --> 08:00.120]  you're just depressed and have nothing physically wrong with you, we want the government to fund
[08:00.120 --> 08:04.800]  killing you because we want the state having the power over life and death.
[08:04.800 --> 08:10.600]  That's the Fabian socialist, British socialist model that is really the dominant global system
[08:10.600 --> 08:15.280]  of these big megamacs and of Microsoft and of IBM and others.
[08:15.280 --> 08:16.280]  That's really who they are.
[08:16.280 --> 08:21.840]  They're social engineers and they've got a huge, horrible group of weak, compromised
[08:21.840 --> 08:30.920]  individuals in Hollywood who are in Salon and in the New York Times and in Vice HBO
[08:30.920 --> 08:39.960]  promoting pedophilia and promoting all of this other evil garbage over and over and
[08:39.960 --> 08:42.640]  over and over again.
[08:42.640 --> 08:46.480]  So what's the latest?
[08:46.480 --> 08:48.480]  They've got the deep state being exposed.
[08:48.480 --> 08:54.040]  They've got it coming out that it's the worst bias and corruption and targeting and setups
[08:54.040 --> 08:59.320]  and frame ups and failed frame ups of Russia gate and spy gate that making what Nixon did
[08:59.320 --> 09:02.760]  look like heaven compared to hell.
[09:02.760 --> 09:03.880]  And so what are they going to do?
[09:03.880 --> 09:08.120]  They're going to have everybody hysterically on every mainstream media channel, every
[09:08.120 --> 09:14.800]  program everywhere, play audio over photos dubbed of a child crying in the night wanting
[09:14.800 --> 09:16.880]  their mama.
[09:16.880 --> 09:21.800]  You know, I left to work this morning and my 13 and a half month old daughter who's
[09:21.800 --> 09:27.040]  just beginning to have separation anxiety, even though she was with my wife, began shrieking
[09:27.040 --> 09:41.800]  and crying as my son and I, my oldest child walked out of the house.
[09:41.800 --> 09:51.360]  And as I closed the door, I heard my little daughter begin to shriek and say bye-bye,
[09:51.360 --> 09:54.960]  bye-bye, bye-bye.
[09:54.960 --> 10:00.240]  And it was so sad I recorded part of it and I wasn't even thinking of why I recorded
[10:00.240 --> 10:01.240]  it.
[10:01.240 --> 10:08.800]  I may actually air this because she was saying bye-bye is why I recorded it.
[10:08.800 --> 10:13.040]  I didn't even think that I could play this and talk about how I deserve to have my house
[10:13.040 --> 10:14.200]  burned down.
[10:14.200 --> 10:16.360]  That's what Cusack's calling for.
[10:16.360 --> 10:22.920]  I deserve to be kidnapped, killed, whatever, because my daughter cried and I made her cry.
[10:22.920 --> 10:25.680]  Think about the mental illness of this.
[10:25.680 --> 10:30.680]  People bring their children across thousands of miles in some cases, hundreds of miles
[10:30.680 --> 10:33.120]  of desert.
[10:33.120 --> 10:37.680]  They get here.
[10:37.680 --> 10:41.880]  And then we have no idea who these people are, in many cases they don't even have IDs.
[10:41.880 --> 10:45.560]  And the media only focuses on the women and children that are a small part of who's coming
[10:45.560 --> 10:50.680]  across and make it look like we're just scooping them up for no reason and putting them in trains
[10:50.680 --> 10:53.480]  to be sent to Auschwitz and Dachau and Buchenwald.
[10:53.480 --> 10:58.520]  And we have the former head of the CIA and the NSA that did all the illegal spying, all
[10:58.520 --> 11:02.600]  the frame ups, all the garbage, pointing his finger at our president and saying he's
[11:02.600 --> 11:06.920]  a Nazi, loading people on trains.
[11:06.920 --> 11:11.160]  And as the Attorney General pointed out, people were trying to get out of Nazi Germany.
[11:11.160 --> 11:17.120]  They weren't trying to get in.
[11:17.120 --> 11:18.840]  Unbelievable.
[11:18.840 --> 11:24.480]  So that's the reality, and you've got the Democrats not just now pushing to distract
[11:24.480 --> 11:28.760]  from the Russia gate, the spy gate, and how that's exposing their criminal activity in
[11:28.760 --> 11:33.160]  the deep state, trying to overthrow an election, trying to stop an election, saying he'll never
[11:33.160 --> 11:37.280]  be president once he is, we've got to keep him from getting in, we've got to block him
[11:37.280 --> 11:38.640]  from being inaugurated.
[11:38.640 --> 11:40.240]  Remember all that?
[11:40.240 --> 11:43.760]  Remember all that and lying to you and saying they hadn't spied on you?
[11:43.760 --> 11:50.600]  And they've got this little arrogant, corrupt, compromised nerd, General Hayden.
[11:50.600 --> 11:53.720]  If anybody looks like a pedophile, it's him, I'm not saying he's a pedophile, but God
[11:53.720 --> 11:55.160]  does he look like one.
[11:55.160 --> 12:00.640]  I was casting a pedophile, I was casting a child murderer for a movie, and casting
[12:00.640 --> 12:04.840]  like somebody that kidnaps kids and eats their brains, I would cast Hayden.
[12:04.840 --> 12:05.840]  Seriously.
[12:05.840 --> 12:10.720]  He does any little soft, gremlin-like person on a power trip who gets to look at all your
[12:10.720 --> 12:14.880]  e-mail and read all you do and look at the photos you put on the cloud, you and your
[12:14.880 --> 12:19.400]  wife and everything else, and he gets to oversee all the blackmail and all the control and
[12:19.400 --> 12:24.040]  vault seven CIA stuff framing everybody.
[12:24.040 --> 12:30.440]  And then they show photos of Obama era, Drudge has it, when they didn't have these things
[12:30.440 --> 12:35.480]  set up right, so they had them under tinfoil blankets, space blankets, actually worked
[12:35.480 --> 12:40.360]  pretty good if that's all you got, look DrudgeReport.com has it, so they're showing old photos
[12:40.360 --> 12:47.000]  on CNN with Hayden of what Obama did and kids that were in smaller cages, not larger facilities,
[12:47.000 --> 12:51.120]  and saying it's Trump when it's them.
[12:51.120 --> 12:55.600]  Total frauds, total liars, but I don't know if he's a pedophile, he just looks like one.
[12:55.600 --> 13:00.720]  I know he's a lying, deep state sack of garbage with Phil Mudd and Brennan and all the rest
[13:00.720 --> 13:08.080]  of those crooks that have been caught red-handed, red-handed, ladies and gentlemen.
[13:08.080 --> 13:13.240]  So, the next level isn't just distract from what's happened, the next level isn't just
[13:13.240 --> 13:16.040]  a distract from the fact that they've been caught, that they've been found out, the next
[13:16.040 --> 13:22.080]  level is to call for pedophiles to sexually assault the president's son, because that's
[13:22.080 --> 13:27.600]  what Hollywood does, that's their fetish, it's what they're upset with Trump about,
[13:27.600 --> 13:29.920]  that he's trying to put the brakes on that.
[13:29.920 --> 13:35.640]  And so, Paul Watson's info wars.com article is top linked up on DrudgeReport.com right
[13:35.640 --> 13:41.880]  now, actor Peter Fonda, we don't know he's a pedophile, we just know he's calling for
[13:41.880 --> 13:52.200]  pedophiles to assault a 12-year-old, so actor Peter Peter Fonda encourages targeting children
[13:52.200 --> 13:58.680]  of border patrol and ICE agents, quote, we should find out what schools they go to, scare
[13:58.680 --> 14:04.520]  the bleep out of them, and make their children worry, yes let's stop children, but that headline
[14:04.520 --> 14:09.080]  isn't even strong enough, do you know what he actually said and it's in the story, Paul
[14:09.080 --> 14:15.240]  Watson chronicles it at Prison Planet, you should retweet it, things at IM Fonda, which
[14:15.240 --> 14:20.160]  you are as a sicko, has encouraged in the last 24 hours, showing up at schools to scare
[14:20.160 --> 14:25.600]  the bleep out of children of border patrol agents, quote, putting Baron Trump in a cage
[14:25.600 --> 14:30.360]  with pedophiles, hacking a government database, this is really going to be an interesting
[14:30.360 --> 14:35.400]  test of Twitter's terms of service, they'll probably make him a moderator for what he's
[14:35.400 --> 14:42.440]  done, but it's worse than what Paul even says, he calls in the tweet for kidnapping Baron
[14:42.440 --> 14:47.040]  and taking him and putting him in a cage with pedophiles, actually taking hundreds and hundreds
[14:47.040 --> 14:52.120]  of people a day per sector, sometimes thousands, sometimes it's thousands that are, stop at
[14:52.120 --> 14:57.560]  the border, sneaking in, and 80% of which the women have been raped, and taking them and
[14:57.560 --> 15:00.760]  getting them checked for disease, giving them food, giving them clothing, giving them showers
[15:00.760 --> 15:05.960]  and putting women in one area, children in another, and men in another, while you vet
[15:05.960 --> 15:09.960]  who's got a pedophilia conviction, who's got a criminal arson, who's got an armed robbery,
[15:09.960 --> 15:15.880]  who's been deported 15 times, who's connected to MS-13, that's keeping children from being
[15:15.880 --> 15:22.200]  put in cages with pedophiles, you don't throw kids in a general population when crimes have
[15:22.200 --> 15:26.120]  been committed and you're being put into there to find out who you are, that's just normal
[15:26.120 --> 15:31.480]  default, having a border, having a country, but Fonda turns it around that Trump's putting
[15:31.480 --> 15:38.280]  kids in cages with pedophiles and then he dreams of the 12-year-old boy, which I guess
[15:38.280 --> 15:45.360]  excites Fonda, obviously being raped, being thrown in, so Peter Fonda has called for the
[15:45.360 --> 15:51.280]  president's son to be kidnapped, put in a cage with child rapist, that's what he's calling
[15:51.280 --> 15:58.200]  for, and he needs to get in a lot of trouble for it, hope he doesn't fall down and hit
[15:58.200 --> 15:59.200]  his face.
[15:59.200 --> 16:02.480]  I tried other brands, but I came back to my sunshine.

[16:07.560 --> 16:12.560]  Sometimes life can be a pain in the neck, or back, or shoulder.

[16:15.880 --> 16:19.680]  Did you know that the American College of Physicians said that one of the best ways

[18:00.280 --> 18:05.600]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[18:05.600 --> 18:10.800]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[18:10.800 --> 18:17.600]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[18:17.600 --> 18:23.480]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[18:23.480 --> 18:26.800]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[18:26.800 --> 18:31.720]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit
[18:31.720 --> 18:38.120]  of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[18:38.120 --> 18:41.680]  Pollen block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine.
[18:41.680 --> 18:46.400]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[18:46.400 --> 18:52.200]  triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:52.200 --> 18:54.880]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[18:54.880 --> 19:01.120]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.

[20:03.480 --> 20:13.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:13.480 --> 20:17.000]  News, analysis, reports.
[20:17.000 --> 20:18.960]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[20:18.960 --> 20:31.880]  So the sickos in Hollywood that think they've got control of this country's mind and soul
[20:31.880 --> 20:32.880]  are starting to get scared.
[20:32.880 --> 20:39.600]  They realize that their corrupt, degenerate, anti-human, anti-family, pro-abortion, anti-Christian
[20:39.600 --> 20:44.040]  system is being rejected not just here but all over the world.
[20:44.040 --> 20:49.440]  And Hollywood and the big banks and the communist Chinese are openly allied with the EU against
[20:49.440 --> 20:50.960]  America.
[20:50.960 --> 20:56.120]  But America is coming back and all over the world there are populist nationalist candidates
[20:56.120 --> 21:04.520]  and people winning office that are now allied with the return of America and 1776 worldwide.
[21:04.520 --> 21:09.920]  Why not have 1776 and just the renaissance idea of freedom is bigger than America versus
[21:09.920 --> 21:17.160]  collectivism and versus globalism and mega banks that are tax exempt and exempt from
[21:17.160 --> 21:22.520]  law who then tell us we can't have prosperity, we can't have families who then use racial
[21:22.520 --> 21:27.280]  and cultural division to play us off against each other.
[21:27.280 --> 21:31.000]  Now here's the big news, ladies and gentlemen.
[21:31.000 --> 21:35.600]  The desperate scum in Hollywood are calling for violence against Trump, violence against
[21:35.600 --> 21:37.880]  his family, violence against Republicans.
[21:37.880 --> 21:42.840]  They're calling for confronting anyone that's a nationalist and saying how dare you hurt
[21:42.840 --> 21:44.840]  children.
[21:44.840 --> 21:50.240]  When Mexico has hundreds of thousands of dead in the last few years in their road warrior
[21:50.240 --> 21:55.560]  level societal collapse, hundreds of thousands have been killed, hundreds of thousands haven't
[21:55.560 --> 21:56.720]  been found.
[21:56.720 --> 22:02.760]  They found over 100,000 buried in mass graves along the Texas border right through to Arizona
[22:02.760 --> 22:11.080]  on the Mexico side, killed by the smugglers, killed by the banditos, killed by the criminals.
[22:11.080 --> 22:13.960]  But there's no movies, there's no TV shows, there's nothing.
[22:13.960 --> 22:18.320]  They don't humanize any of those people.
[22:18.320 --> 22:19.920]  It's unbelievable.
[22:19.920 --> 22:23.160]  They're constantly finding dozens here, 100 there, 20 here.
[22:23.160 --> 22:27.240]  It's estimated there's hundreds of thousands, close to 200,000 dead admittedly, but they
[22:27.240 --> 22:32.600]  haven't found many of the bodies in comparison.
[22:32.600 --> 22:38.280]  So you've got that being underreported and then you've got Peter Fonda, this washed up
[22:38.280 --> 22:39.280]  guy.
[22:39.280 --> 22:45.640]  I don't think he's been in a big movie since, what's that one he's in with Jack Nicholson
[22:45.640 --> 22:51.400]  born to be wild motorcycle movie.
[22:51.400 --> 22:56.000]  So he hasn't been in a movie in something like 50 years anybody watched.
[22:56.000 --> 22:59.280]  He's the son of a movie star.
[22:59.280 --> 23:03.840]  He's a Hollywood thumb-sucking degenerate brat.
[23:03.840 --> 23:10.760]  And he joins other losers like John Cusack calling for burning down the shelter centers
[23:10.760 --> 23:14.880]  that the children on average spend two days in when they're vetting who's who.
[23:14.880 --> 23:15.880]  Yeah.
[23:15.880 --> 23:16.880]  Easy Rider.
[23:16.880 --> 23:21.120]  It wasn't born to be wild, but they have that soundtrack in it from Steppenwolf.
[23:21.120 --> 23:23.600]  Easy Rider.
[23:23.600 --> 23:26.360]  So there you go.
[23:26.360 --> 23:34.800]  So a bunch of old hippies that nobody cares about and Jack Nicholson, the big buddy with
[23:34.800 --> 23:44.840]  Roman Polanski, just another group of has-beens, fossils, crypt keepers coming out and saying
[23:44.840 --> 23:47.800]  we want to burn down the migrant centers.
[23:47.800 --> 23:48.800]  That'll be great.
[23:48.800 --> 23:49.800]  Kill a bunch of people.
[23:49.800 --> 23:55.520]  And notice the Democrats are always saying I'm going to incite some out of violence.
[23:55.520 --> 23:56.960]  They're the ones calling for it.
[23:56.960 --> 24:04.040]  Now this degenerate, this washed up nobody, Peter Henry Fonda, has gone on his Twitter
[24:04.040 --> 24:10.000]  account, document him shot please, I'm going to blur out some of the cuss words here for
[24:10.000 --> 24:12.040]  TV stations that are picking this up.
[24:12.040 --> 24:18.400]  And he said we should rip Baron Trump from his mother's arms and put him in a cage with
[24:18.400 --> 24:23.400]  pedophiles and see if the mother will stand up against the giant.
[24:23.400 --> 24:24.400]  You know what?
[24:24.400 --> 24:30.680]  She is married to 90 million people in the streets on the same weekend in the country.
[24:30.680 --> 24:31.680]  That's the goal.
[24:31.680 --> 24:32.960]  And that's the talking point.
[24:32.960 --> 24:35.640]  They want civil war.
[24:35.640 --> 24:41.960]  That came out January 10th, 2018 document details plan for civil unrest and Marshall
[24:41.960 --> 24:48.720]  law working with blue cities and Antifa staging riots hoping to get the citizens involved
[24:48.720 --> 24:51.920]  in mainly black areas to cause a race war.
[24:51.920 --> 24:58.120]  Go read the 30 plus pages yourself and they admit these documents are real.
[24:58.120 --> 25:04.840]  Soros response to me publishing these is to finance a bunch of lawsuits against us.
[25:04.840 --> 25:05.840]  Think about that.
[25:05.840 --> 25:07.240]  So they're still doing it.
[25:07.240 --> 25:10.760]  And that's why the former head of the CIA saying Trump sending children to concentration
[25:10.760 --> 25:11.760]  camps.
[25:11.760 --> 25:12.760]  Hitler.
[25:12.760 --> 25:16.160]  No, the Democrats are advertising come here.
[25:16.160 --> 25:20.040]  You've got a whole bunch of people that have made it across with diseases.
[25:20.040 --> 25:21.040]  You name it.
[25:21.040 --> 25:22.800]  We're going to vet them and see who they are.
[25:22.800 --> 25:25.640]  And they say, oh my gosh, you're the worst person in the world.
[25:25.640 --> 25:31.120]  And then Henry Fonda comes out, Peter Henry Fonda, his dad was Henry Fonda.
[25:31.120 --> 25:36.320]  And he says we should kidnap the president's son and put him in a cage so pedophiles can
[25:36.320 --> 25:39.720]  have sex willing.
[25:39.720 --> 25:43.560]  That's the kind of sick stuff going on in his mind when Trump's keeping kids from being
[25:43.560 --> 25:48.080]  put in general population where they would end up getting raped just like the Superdome
[25:48.080 --> 25:49.080]  and Katrina.
[25:49.080 --> 25:53.200]  And just like they do in Europe, where they do just put them in general, migrant camps
[25:53.200 --> 25:54.200]  of hell.
[25:54.200 --> 25:59.080]  And many of the kids Obama did just release Washington Post, you can pull it up.
[25:59.080 --> 26:04.280]  Many of the children released under Obama's migrant child program ended up in sex traffic
[26:04.280 --> 26:05.720]  and were killed.
[26:05.720 --> 26:06.720]  That's the Washington Post.
[26:06.720 --> 26:10.120]  If you guys can't find it, we had it last night.
[26:10.120 --> 26:11.120]  It's a key article.
[26:11.120 --> 26:12.960]  I'm going to pull that up.
[26:12.960 --> 26:15.400]  So think about this.
[26:15.400 --> 26:16.400]  There it is.
[26:16.400 --> 26:20.000]  Obama administration placed children with human traffickers report says Washington Post.
[26:20.000 --> 26:21.000]  That's the Washington Post.
[26:21.000 --> 26:22.840]  Who first broke that?
[26:22.840 --> 26:24.760]  Four years ago.
[26:24.760 --> 26:27.720]  We broke it in 2014.
[26:27.720 --> 26:29.720]  They were forced to report on it in 2016.
[26:29.720 --> 26:33.360]  Now since Bezos bought them, they won't report on anything true.
[26:33.360 --> 26:40.840]  They had some integrity before, so they want us to just let people in and let the Democrats
[26:40.840 --> 26:45.000]  and the Coyotes on this side pick them up in vans.
[26:45.000 --> 26:49.840]  And God knows where we would be all aiding true human trafficking and violating federal
[26:49.840 --> 26:51.880]  law as Obama did.
[26:51.880 --> 26:55.960]  Yeah, put me that article too as well.
[26:55.960 --> 26:59.280]  So this is unbelievable child abuse.
[26:59.280 --> 27:02.520]  The Democrats say come here, go through the most dangerous area in the world, Northern
[27:02.520 --> 27:03.520]  Mexico.
[27:03.520 --> 27:07.200]  Then when they get here, if we want to vet them and protect the children, we are heartless
[27:07.200 --> 27:08.200]  scum.
[27:08.200 --> 27:09.200]  We are the devils.
[27:09.200 --> 27:10.200]  We're the worst people.
[27:10.200 --> 27:11.200]  But it gets worse.
[27:11.200 --> 27:20.560]  Fonda says hack government databases, ol' Pete, ol' Peter, ol' Pete, not saying he's
[27:20.560 --> 27:21.560]  a pedophile.
[27:21.560 --> 27:23.400]  He just wants pedophiles to be with children.
[27:23.400 --> 27:28.840]  So I guess, you know, he's like the enabler, Pete O Pete, Pete O Pete Fonda, ol' Pete
[27:28.840 --> 27:32.520]  O Peter Fonda, wow, you're a sick freak.
[27:32.520 --> 27:37.360]  And let me tell you, you old dirty hippie, you old degenerate piece of crap.
[27:37.360 --> 27:38.680]  We're going to make America great again.
[27:38.680 --> 27:39.680]  We're taking the country back.
[27:39.680 --> 27:43.280]  We're going to bring everybody of every color together, one race, like Martin Luther King
[27:43.280 --> 27:47.120]  talked about it, all you dirty race bait and Democrats, we all see right through you and
[27:47.120 --> 27:51.920]  the KKK family you're part of, the whole KKK culture.
[27:51.920 --> 27:54.840]  And no matter what you do to us, we're going to break your back.
[27:54.840 --> 27:56.160]  We've already broken your will.
[27:56.160 --> 27:58.360]  So Madhouse crying, they're all freaking out.
[27:58.360 --> 28:01.480]  They're all going crazy because they know the truth.
[28:01.480 --> 28:03.760]  Then he is obsessed with children.
[28:03.760 --> 28:08.000]  He says that he is going to go and that he's going to call for 90 million people to go
[28:08.000 --> 28:12.600]  stalk conservatives and border patrol and ICE agents at their homes and their children's
[28:12.600 --> 28:16.080]  schools to terrorize the children.
[28:16.080 --> 28:21.040]  We should hack the system, quote, get their addresses of the ICE agents, CPB agents, and
[28:21.040 --> 28:23.040]  surround their homes in protest.
[28:23.040 --> 28:27.600]  We should find out what schools or children go to and surround the schools in protest.
[28:27.600 --> 28:30.560]  These agents are doing this because they want to do it.
[28:30.560 --> 28:33.800]  They like doing this.
[28:33.800 --> 28:39.440]  And more and more and more show up at school, scare the bleep out of the children, put Baron
[28:39.440 --> 28:45.040]  Trump in a cage, kidnap him, give him the pedophiles, hack government databases.
[28:45.040 --> 28:48.600]  Isn't that just not, we need to make them worry about their children.
[28:48.600 --> 28:54.440]  Ooh, classic textbook stalking, saying they're doing it to terrorize people in mafia racketeering
[28:54.440 --> 28:55.440]  to make a submit to them.
[28:55.440 --> 28:56.440]  It has a name.
[28:56.440 --> 28:59.480]  It's called terrorism.
[28:59.480 --> 29:03.240]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[29:03.240 --> 29:08.000]  What if I told you for just 54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally
[29:08.000 --> 29:09.960]  at heart and body extract.

[29:32.920 --> 29:36.040]  I'm a former decorated CIA officer.
[29:36.040 --> 29:39.840]  Finally someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-Mose on the shadow
[29:39.840 --> 29:40.840]  government ever.
[29:40.840 --> 29:46.400]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[29:46.400 --> 29:49.600]  We've got to get this out because just because you're awake folks doesn't mean other people
[29:49.600 --> 29:50.600]  are.
[29:50.600 --> 29:53.400]  It's critical to get, to read, to give them a library, to give them a charge, to get
[29:53.400 --> 29:56.080]  them right now at KillingUncleSanBook.com.

[30:57.080 --> 31:00.200]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[31:00.200 --> 31:04.160]  Guaranteeing your food independence is a crucial part of prepping.
[31:04.160 --> 31:09.520]  Between debt crisis, natural disasters, or even simple power outages, having a supply
[31:09.520 --> 31:11.960]  of storable meals is crucial.

[32:00.240 --> 32:04.080]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[32:04.080 --> 32:08.600]  The real drama can be found here in Lailania states, but a lot of us on the big island
[32:08.600 --> 32:14.040]  rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[32:14.040 --> 32:19.440]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[32:19.440 --> 32:20.960]  to unhealthy levels.
[32:20.960 --> 32:27.480]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[32:27.480 --> 32:31.480]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[32:31.480 --> 32:32.720]  in the rainwater.
[32:32.720 --> 32:38.200]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy
[32:38.200 --> 32:44.280]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[32:44.280 --> 32:49.880]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[32:49.880 --> 32:55.440]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply, but more
[32:55.440 --> 33:03.000]  importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[33:03.000 --> 33:11.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:11.440 --> 33:16.760]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[33:16.760 --> 33:18.320]  You want to stop tyranny?
[33:18.320 --> 33:24.480]  Well, so does he, live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:24.480 --> 33:41.440]  Peter Fonda is saying, Rachel Maddow is saying, the former head of the CIA, Hayden is saying,
[33:41.440 --> 33:43.720]  Phil Mudd, his deputy is saying it.
[33:43.720 --> 33:48.120]  They're all saying we want civil insurrection, we want to overthrow Trump, we want war in
[33:48.120 --> 33:51.320]  the streets, and then we've got Soros documents admitting it all.
[33:51.320 --> 34:00.600]  And then Peter Henry Fonda, the washed up child star of Henry Fonda, comes out and says,
[34:00.600 --> 34:10.920]  we want to kidnap, you heard me right, we want to kidnap Baron Trump and put him into
[34:10.920 --> 34:17.000]  a cage with pedophiles when Trump's stopping these many of them unaccompanied minors and
[34:17.000 --> 34:21.440]  finding out who they are to not put them in general population with pedophiles potentially.
[34:21.440 --> 34:26.880]  And then he calls for civil insurrection, 90 million in the streets, harassing and targeting
[34:26.880 --> 34:32.560]  and going after the families of Border Patrol agents, stealing their identities, hacking
[34:32.560 --> 34:41.320]  into databases, harassing the children, look at DrudgeReport.com, it's all right there.
[34:41.320 --> 34:50.280]  85 blast list of personal photos and identities of Border agents and ICE, Melania breaking,
[34:50.280 --> 34:59.560]  call secret service after actor threatens to kidnap Baron, cage with pedophiles, absolutely.
[34:59.560 --> 35:04.440]  Protesters chase Homeland Security Secretary from restaurant, there's video of that, the
[35:04.440 --> 35:06.480]  media's like, yay, get them, get them, do more.
[35:06.480 --> 35:10.720]  Remember when they got up on stage and told Dana Loesch, you're a murderer, and they said,
[35:10.720 --> 35:13.600]  burn her, burn her, burn her.
[35:13.600 --> 35:18.160]  I thought I was watching a Monty Python skit, she's a witch, how do you know, she got a
[35:18.160 --> 35:20.880]  mole on her nose.
[35:20.880 --> 35:26.000]  So this is what the Democrats want, they want Milo chased out of a New York restaurant,
[35:26.000 --> 35:34.680]  screaming Nazi, Nazi, Nazi, when he's a gay Jewish guy, they want the Homeland Security
[35:34.680 --> 35:38.680]  Secretary chased out of a restaurant, they want me chased out of restaurants, this is
[35:38.680 --> 35:39.680]  what they do.
[35:39.680 --> 35:47.160]  I was in a restaurant in Hawaii, sitting there with Zimmerman, ordering lunch up at the counter
[35:47.160 --> 35:50.000]  because it was quicker to go back out to the pool where the kids were waiting than to order
[35:50.000 --> 35:54.400]  through the waiters at the pool, the service was real slow, and I'm getting the hamburgers
[35:54.400 --> 35:58.640]  and stuff and the drinks, and this woman walks over and she goes, I just want to ask you
[35:58.640 --> 36:02.800]  one question, how do you sleep with yourself at night, how horrible and evil you are?
[36:02.800 --> 36:07.120]  And I said, man, that's not really true, let's talk about this, get away from me, I'm calling
[36:07.120 --> 36:08.800]  security, get away, get away.
[36:08.800 --> 36:14.280]  They're all drama queens, they're all fraudsters, they're scammers, it's what they do, they
[36:14.280 --> 36:15.280]  lie.
[36:15.280 --> 36:19.680]  Bernie Sanders guy was bumping into me at the airport saying, stop touching me Alex,
[36:19.680 --> 36:24.000]  stop touching me Alex, getting in close to the camera so you couldn't see that he was
[36:24.000 --> 36:26.040]  bumping me.
[36:26.040 --> 36:30.760]  That's what they are, they're deceivers, they're constituents, they're deceivers, in studies
[36:30.760 --> 36:35.040]  they're six times more likely to engage in criminal activity, nine times more likely
[36:35.040 --> 36:41.200]  not to give to charity, that's British studies, US studies, Australian studies, German studies,
[36:41.200 --> 36:44.400]  liberals are posers, they're not real.
[36:44.400 --> 36:48.240]  I'm not even really a conservative, I'm just a libertarian free-thinking, common sense
[36:48.240 --> 36:53.400]  guy, and they hate me because of it, because I want you to be strong, I want you to be
[36:53.400 --> 36:59.560]  independent, and America's coming back, great again, disability applications plunge as
[36:59.560 --> 37:05.560]  economy strengthens.
[37:05.560 --> 37:12.520]  Meanwhile, racial matter has now apologized for fake crying on live TV, Elijah Cummings
[37:12.520 --> 37:13.520]  hasn't done it yet.
[37:13.520 --> 37:17.160]  Oh man, you watch the black congressional caucus knowing that black folks are waking
[37:17.160 --> 37:21.400]  up to them, learning about how blacks are 50 plus percent, other people get aborted and
[37:21.400 --> 37:26.880]  learning about how the Democrats got hired by Margaret Sanger, and how the blacks got
[37:26.880 --> 37:28.840]  hired by her to control them.
[37:28.840 --> 37:32.400]  Democrats are leaving the plantation in mass exodus, so Cummings and everybody just get
[37:32.400 --> 37:36.880]  more and more crazy, more and more out of control, with the kids are in internment camps,
[37:36.880 --> 37:40.720]  they're in concentration camps, blah blah blah, he doesn't say a word about half the
[37:40.720 --> 37:45.040]  black kids getting aborted, he doesn't say a word about thousands of people shot dead
[37:45.040 --> 37:49.600]  in Chicago every year, black on black, he doesn't say a word about MTV and the MTV Awards
[37:49.600 --> 37:58.280]  last night that I monitored, 100% race war, whites are evil, Hollywood wants to use black
[37:58.280 --> 38:03.000]  Americans as the political detonator for civil war in this country and black folks aren't
[38:03.000 --> 38:10.920]  buying it and they don't know what to do, it is so insane to watch it all happening.
[38:10.920 --> 38:20.960]  And now, the big news, Melania called secret service after actor threatened to kidnap
[38:20.960 --> 38:31.360]  Barron Trump, I called Paul about an hour ago, I said Paul I'm glad to see your stories
[38:31.360 --> 38:31.000]  on drudgeport.com, but I said them threatening war patrol agents, children and saying harass
[38:31.000 --> 38:36.360]  them and breaking the databases is big, but not as big as saying kidnap the president's
[38:36.360 --> 38:43.120]  son, Barron, and put him in a cage with pedophiles, that's the real crime right there.
[38:43.120 --> 38:51.040]  Spokesman for the first lady, Stephanie Grisham, has informed the daily caller that the secret
[38:51.040 --> 38:55.400]  service has been notified of the threat and the tweet is sick and irresponsible and the
[38:55.400 --> 39:00.560]  U.S.S.S., United States Secret Service has been notified.
[39:00.560 --> 39:04.520]  A story is at dailycaller.com, it's on infowars.com and I'm going to just give Paul the credit
[39:04.520 --> 39:05.520]  because Paul's awesome.
[39:05.520 --> 39:09.520]  This is the number one story in the country right now, Paul is on it, he had the first
[39:09.520 --> 39:17.160]  story, drudge had it up first, and my only angle to Paul was, I'd change that headline
[39:17.160 --> 39:25.440]  to they call for kidnapping the president's son and put it in a cage with pedophiles.
[39:25.440 --> 39:35.040]  And I want to add the point again that if you expand on all of this, this is part of
[39:35.040 --> 39:37.240]  a talking point they're putting out.
[39:37.240 --> 39:38.240]  This is what they want.
[39:38.240 --> 39:43.240]  They want violence, they want attacks, they want to bully everybody into submitting.
[39:43.240 --> 39:48.440]  They think if they throw coffee on me or come up and threaten me or sue me or say they're
[39:48.440 --> 39:54.400]  going to kidnap the president's son or they shoot Congressman Scalise or they do all this
[39:54.400 --> 39:58.960]  stuff that we're going to go, oh my gosh, don't hurt me, I better conform.
[39:58.960 --> 40:04.080]  No, we bought into political correctness because it was an extension of the civil rights movement
[40:04.080 --> 40:06.800]  and what conservatives and Christians did.
[40:06.800 --> 40:07.880]  That was something good.
[40:07.880 --> 40:12.640]  You guys hijacked Martin Luther King and all of that and now I've twisted it back into
[40:12.640 --> 40:17.960]  a race-based system of guilt and control and people are rejecting it.
[40:17.960 --> 40:23.520]  They're rejecting Georgetown, they're rejecting Evergreen College, they're rejecting Missouri
[40:23.520 --> 40:28.680]  State where they say whites aren't allowed, white men aren't allowed on campus today.
[40:28.680 --> 40:32.160]  Get me some muscle, get these white people out of here and it's a weird white lady doing
[40:32.160 --> 40:33.160]  it.
[40:33.160 --> 40:39.280]  That very university has signed on to the fake lawsuit against me in Virginia and they say
[40:39.280 --> 40:41.400]  they want me taken off the air.
[40:41.400 --> 40:43.680]  Yeah, let's play her.
[40:43.680 --> 40:44.680]  What's that lady's name again?
[40:44.680 --> 40:47.840]  I always forget it.
[40:47.840 --> 40:48.840]  Melissa Klick.
[40:48.840 --> 40:54.800]  Let's hear her come over and tell an Asian guy, by the way, it was the camera guy, you're
[40:54.800 --> 40:55.800]  not allowed to be here either.
[40:55.800 --> 41:00.400]  Oh, and Harvard, their internal documents have come out in lawsuits now, even CNN had to report
[41:00.400 --> 41:07.960]  it saying that Asians aren't socially well and that Asians are inferior when it comes
[41:07.960 --> 41:10.760]  to their social intellects.
[41:10.760 --> 41:16.640]  So the most stereotypical racist stuff, but see, that's the left.
[41:16.640 --> 41:21.840]  The Asians don't need them, they're the top nine performing groups according to race,
[41:21.840 --> 41:24.000]  according to amount of money they make.
[41:24.000 --> 41:33.720]  White people are number 10 below Asian groups and yeah, that's an older article, it just
[41:33.720 --> 41:34.720]  came out this weekend.
[41:34.720 --> 41:40.720]  I meant to cover it Sunday, but I got so busy I didn't get to it and I think I printed it.
[41:40.720 --> 41:48.600]  It was Harvard rated Asians lower on social traits, humor and humanity.
[41:48.600 --> 41:51.880]  They actually said they're not as human.
[41:51.880 --> 41:57.040]  Really, my sister is super funny and super human and super smart and she's Korean.
[41:57.040 --> 42:01.000]  Go to hell, CNN and Harvard and all you people, you're full of it.
[42:01.000 --> 42:03.160]  She just doesn't need you.
[42:03.160 --> 42:05.600]  She doesn't want to be dependent on you.
[42:05.600 --> 42:11.600]  She's upwardly mobile, culturally, genetically, however.
[42:11.600 --> 42:14.160]  Look at communism in North Korea, they can't even make a car.
[42:14.160 --> 42:17.480]  South Korea is the most productive country in the world per capita.
[42:17.480 --> 42:22.360]  The exact same people, but under different ideology, allowed to have some freedom soaring
[42:22.360 --> 42:25.320]  and Harvard doesn't want that.
[42:25.320 --> 42:30.720]  They want a bunch of people, they can get in there and get all angry and upset and manipulated
[42:30.720 --> 42:36.000]  so they can be programmed to go out and cause more social disruption because they want you
[42:36.000 --> 42:37.000]  on the plantation.
[42:37.000 --> 42:41.520]  They want to train a bunch of house slaves at Harvard and Missouri State and the rest
[42:41.520 --> 42:42.520]  of it.
[42:42.520 --> 42:45.120]  When we come back we'll play her saying get me some muscle.
[42:45.120 --> 42:48.800]  That's incredible, but hey, there's the Democrats calling for all their violence, all their
[42:48.800 --> 42:52.520]  other garbage because they're desperate and they're scared and they want to do what?
[42:52.520 --> 42:56.400]  Change the subject from the hearings yesterday that we're going to cover straight ahead.

[46:10.240 --> 46:13.800]  As the years went on and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew
[46:13.800 --> 46:17.880]  we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[46:17.880 --> 46:22.880]  Myco zx plus is the result of the search for that formula, a unique natural formula designed

[47:04.000 --> 47:21.760]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:21.760 --> 47:26.240]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[47:26.240 --> 47:28.240]  It's Alex Jones.
[47:28.240 --> 47:33.640]  So, the desperate megacorporations that finance the giant colleges that give you worthless
[47:33.640 --> 47:38.160]  degrees on average are extending their call for free speech to be banned everywhere.
[47:38.160 --> 47:42.560]  They also want to script themselves as the heroes, showing you've got collapsing third
[47:42.560 --> 47:46.280]  world countries coming in, thousands of people being picked up a day per sector, and they
[47:46.280 --> 47:48.440]  are then checking in for diseases and vetting them.
[47:48.440 --> 47:53.240]  You don't put just children in with general population if somebody just trekked across
[47:53.240 --> 47:58.720]  the desert of Mexico, facing the smugglers and death and 80% of the women get raped.
[47:58.720 --> 48:04.600]  Oh, but the bad guys are the border patrol there, everything under surveillance, everything
[48:04.600 --> 48:11.000]  brought in by the book, everybody's showered clean, given food, talked to by an expert.
[48:11.000 --> 48:14.440]  That's the evil Americans that don't have a heart.
[48:14.440 --> 48:18.800]  After all, it's not Nicaragua or Salvador or Venezuela or Mexico or Guatemala, none
[48:18.800 --> 48:20.200]  of them ever did anything bad.
[48:20.200 --> 48:23.640]  No, no, no, when they kill American tourists or kidnap people and shake their families
[48:23.640 --> 48:30.120]  down or, no, no, no, no, it's America's bad, Chuck E. Schumer said so, and Rachel Maddow
[48:30.120 --> 48:36.800]  said so, and remember, Melissa Click, she's a white woman, but she can tell the white
[48:36.800 --> 48:42.800]  guys there at Missouri State, remember, that get me some muscle, she says to the black
[48:42.800 --> 48:47.800]  guy, you're not allowed being white to come on the campus, we say so today, we've taken
[48:47.800 --> 48:53.720]  control of it, they're invoking total racial division.
[48:53.720 --> 48:59.360]  And I've got a new article on infowars.com by PJW, Never Trump Conservatives, their new
[48:59.360 --> 49:05.560]  talking point, a whole bunch of them came out and said whites are bad and must be replaced.
[49:05.560 --> 49:09.560]  So they're trying to tell all these unskilled people coming in, white people are bad, come
[49:09.560 --> 49:16.520]  on in and hate white people, that's the Republicans, that's Crystal and the rest of these folks.
[49:16.520 --> 49:23.880]  Wow, unbelievable, if only we could keep the hardworking Latin America newcomers and deport
[49:23.880 --> 49:29.560]  the contemptible Republican cowards, that would truly enhance America's greatness, yes,
[49:29.560 --> 49:34.600]  and then Crystal goes on and says, the problem is white people, that's right, it's the white
[49:34.600 --> 49:38.600]  people that we have one of the most open societies in the world and all the rest of this, and
[49:38.600 --> 49:42.320]  that the biggest group is Chinese women coming in now to have their babies free, who become
[49:42.320 --> 49:47.960]  citizens and then get all the free goodies. See, these are race-based folks, so they all
[49:47.960 --> 49:51.360]  look at the demographics and go, well America's not white anymore, let's jump in and try to
[49:51.360 --> 49:58.240]  make minorities racist and make it all a race-based system instead of a system of free market.
[49:58.240 --> 50:03.720]  It's unbelievable, meanwhile, Melania Trump is called secret service after actor threatens
[50:03.720 --> 50:12.360]  to kidnap and rape her son. Peter Fonda, the washed up for life actor, total bumbling
[50:12.360 --> 50:17.920]  Hollywood scumbag, says he wants to kidnap and put him in a cage with pedophiles. Well,
[50:17.920 --> 50:24.600]  that's what the Democrats want, just releasing kids to whoever's there to pick them up at
[50:24.600 --> 50:28.240]  the border having no idea, that's the child trafficking, the Washington Post has reported
[50:28.240 --> 50:36.040]  that, putting kids in general population, and you know that. Unbelievable what a teleprompter
[50:36.040 --> 50:40.480]  reading virtue signaler he is, so here's Melissa Klick.
[50:40.480 --> 50:47.640]  I made it, can I talk to you? No, you need to get out, you need to get out. No, I don't.
[50:47.640 --> 50:52.760]  You need to get out. I actually don't. Alright. Hey, you want to help me get this reporter
[50:52.760 --> 51:02.840]  out of here, I need some muscle over here. I need some muscle and here come the folks.
[51:02.840 --> 51:06.360]  Think about that, the getting all the minorities together and saying the whites are over there,
[51:06.360 --> 51:10.960]  you're not with them, you can't trust them, only us, only me, the little professor, I'm
[51:10.960 --> 51:16.240]  white but I'm the good white teaching you the other whites want to hurt you. These are
[51:16.240 --> 51:20.880]  the weirdos with chips on their shoulders that seek power and now that university is
[51:20.880 --> 51:28.160]  joining in the lawsuit against me in Missouri and in their lawsuit they say we want Jones
[51:28.160 --> 51:37.720]  silenced, we want Info Wars taken off the air, we run America, no you don't and we see
[51:37.720 --> 51:49.520]  right through you horrible, race-baiting people, just you are monsters, unbelievable.
[51:49.520 --> 51:53.480]  And then of course don't forget, you've got all these other washed up Hollywood people,
[51:53.480 --> 51:59.320]  they call them stars, I call them droppings, John Cusack coming out saying burn down the
[51:59.320 --> 52:04.920]  immigrant centers. That way they can be picked up by the Democrat vans and buses and trains
[52:04.920 --> 52:08.400]  and taken to God knows where. Washington Post reports a lot of them into the sex trade,
[52:08.400 --> 52:14.520]  a lot of them killed but that's okay because John Cusack's got that same lazy-eyed look
[52:14.520 --> 52:23.360]  in his eye, he's anointed, he's in movies. We've got to do what he says, burn it down
[52:23.360 --> 52:32.920]  man. A lot of unbelievable stuff, you know everybody's fleeing the blue states and blue
[52:32.920 --> 52:38.880]  cities, there's a new article on infowars.com by Kit Daniels, Starbucks admits they can't
[52:38.880 --> 52:43.640]  make profit in blue states, we'll cover that later and we'll play the clips of the Republican
[52:43.640 --> 52:49.800]  neo-cons saying white people are the problem. Everything race-based, this is the opposite
[52:49.800 --> 52:55.280]  of Martin Luther King, it's such a hoax, the kids being abused as a hoax, everything's
[52:55.280 --> 53:03.440]  a hoax, everything's a lie, Cummings crying, Mr. Maddow crying, all of this is a joke.
[53:03.440 --> 53:08.640]  Now what are they really distracting from? What are they diverting from? We're going
[53:08.640 --> 53:12.640]  to go to it in a moment, some of the powerful Trey Gowdy statements and even he's being
[53:12.640 --> 53:17.200]  forced down to say the FBI's bad, the Justice Department's bad at the top, this is the worst
[53:17.200 --> 53:20.400]  thing I've ever seen, this is out of control and now you've got the new talking point that's
[53:20.400 --> 53:26.240]  good out on even Fox News, justice must be served, Comey and McCabe must go to jail and
[53:26.240 --> 53:34.280]  that means Hillary, lock her up, lock her up, Hillary for prison. You're clear to fire
[53:34.280 --> 53:39.920]  it will commander. They like to compare it to the empire or the opposite where America
[53:39.920 --> 53:43.120]  coming back against the global empire, if you want to use one, it's like empire strikes
[53:43.120 --> 53:50.360]  back and we've reached the shield generator, fire it will commander, target maximum fire
[53:50.360 --> 53:54.080]  power, we've already blown your generators, we're coming in, it's over and you're not
[53:54.080 --> 53:58.920]  going to escape by the way, so you want to use that, you go ahead and use that, imperial
[53:58.920 --> 54:03.320]  troops have entered the base, imperial troops have entered the base, except patriots have
[54:03.320 --> 54:13.680]  retaken the base, patriots have retaken the base, we are flushing the globalist out. Unbelievable,
[54:13.680 --> 54:19.000]  so we're going to play those clips of gouty here in a moment, but first we have a new

[56:43.200 --> 56:50.720]  Mr. Petey there once Baren be kidnapped and raped inside a dungeon with a pitas is because
[56:50.720 --> 56:55.800]  they're trying to divert from the fact that their whole deep state attempt to stop the
[56:55.800 --> 56:59.360]  take back of America failed so we'll go out to break with just some of gouting and more
[56:59.360 --> 57:00.360]  coming up.
[57:00.360 --> 57:05.240]  And he's talking about how important this is and how momentous it is and he's got a
[57:05.240 --> 57:09.280]  fix and finish when he started with the Hillary Clinton investigation.
[57:09.280 --> 57:15.640]  I have never in 20 years being a prosecutor seen a law enforcement agent with this amount
[57:15.640 --> 57:21.680]  of animus and bias towards the target and I hope and pray he comes next week and portrays
[57:21.680 --> 57:26.720]  himself as a victim and we got a lot more of these clips coming up that they hope we
[57:26.720 --> 57:30.240]  just forget about because now they're talking about prosecutions.
[57:30.240 --> 57:32.880]  The prosecutions must happen.
[57:32.880 --> 57:34.040]  That's the new talking point.

[59:26.120 --> 59:32.000]  censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[59:32.000 --> 59:37.560]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the infowars.com articles, to share the videos,
[59:37.560 --> 59:40.800]  to tell people by the local stations you're listening to, but the bare minimum you can
[59:40.800 --> 59:47.040]  do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[59:47.040 --> 59:53.520]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[59:53.520 --> 1:00:09.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:09.440 --> 1:00:14.840]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[1:00:14.840 --> 1:00:18.320]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[1:00:18.320 --> 1:00:22.360]  Well, we got some really bad news for you.
[1:00:22.360 --> 1:00:29.280]  Article 13 and article 11 passed just about an hour ago and they'll go to the full parliament
[1:00:29.280 --> 1:00:32.960]  coming up in one month to openly in the internet as we know it.
[1:00:32.960 --> 1:00:36.000]  Even liberals admit that it bans memes.
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:41.240]  It controls what you can type before you go on the internet through your browsers.
[1:00:41.240 --> 1:00:43.400]  It is it is the most draconian control.
[1:00:43.400 --> 1:00:46.000]  It's an electronic straight jacket and muzzle.
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:50.280]  Here's Paul Watson breaking some of that down yesterday and then we'll come back with a bombshell
[1:00:50.280 --> 1:00:55.000]  testimony that happened yesterday and so much more and I intend to open the phones up and
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:58.240]  take some of your calls and we have a special guest, but here's Paul breaking some of it
[1:00:58.240 --> 1:00:59.240]  down.
[1:00:59.240 --> 1:01:00.480]  They're really doing it.
[1:01:00.480 --> 1:01:04.040]  They're coming for the one thing that we thought was sacred.
[1:01:04.040 --> 1:01:09.440]  They're coming to ban the memes.
[1:01:09.440 --> 1:01:13.360]  Memes that University College London have developed an algorithm that can automatically
[1:01:13.360 --> 1:01:18.200]  detect and censor hateful content before it's uploaded.
[1:01:18.200 --> 1:01:20.040]  What could possibly go wrong?
[1:01:20.040 --> 1:01:24.760]  Could this algorithm be abused by parties and social media giants to prevent the viral
[1:01:24.760 --> 1:01:29.320]  spread of memes that benefit right of centre political movements and candidates?
[1:01:29.320 --> 1:01:32.720]  They'd never do such a thing, would they?
[1:01:32.720 --> 1:01:34.560]  But why does this matter?
[1:01:34.560 --> 1:01:37.040]  Because memes can change history.
[1:01:37.040 --> 1:01:43.080]  As Richard Dawkins first explained, memes are like genes for information and human evolution
[1:01:43.080 --> 1:01:47.080]  has been guided as much by memes as genes.
[1:01:47.080 --> 1:01:49.720]  Memes compete with each other for survival.
[1:01:49.720 --> 1:01:54.960]  Control the meme, control future, human thought and behaviour.
[1:01:54.960 --> 1:01:56.520]  This is about influence.
[1:01:56.520 --> 1:02:00.720]  Leftist websites like Salon the New Yorker and The Guardian have been bitterly complaining
[1:02:00.720 --> 1:02:06.120]  for years about the undue influence of meme warfare on contemporary politics.
[1:02:06.120 --> 1:02:11.120]  They warn that the political meme has become the centrepiece of disinformation campaigns
[1:02:11.120 --> 1:02:16.040]  and the ability of memes to communicate ideology is boundless.
[1:02:16.040 --> 1:02:19.720]  The power of the political meme has never been greater.
[1:02:19.720 --> 1:02:25.320]  Now what possible motive do you think the left could have for wanting to ban memes?
[1:02:25.320 --> 1:02:29.160]  Could it really be because the left can't meme?
[1:02:29.160 --> 1:02:30.160]  Surely not.
[1:02:30.160 --> 1:02:31.160]  I mean surely they wouldn't.
[1:02:31.160 --> 1:02:32.160]  Yeah, is that?
[1:02:32.160 --> 1:02:36.440]  The University College London study found that the most effective and widely spread memes
[1:02:36.440 --> 1:02:43.160]  largely originated in two places, the Donald and Paul, both of which aren't really known
[1:02:43.160 --> 1:02:44.840]  for their left wing sympathies.
[1:02:44.840 --> 1:02:49.280]  So now we finally have solid proof backed up by the kind of facts and logic that would
[1:02:49.280 --> 1:02:53.880]  even put Ben Shapiro to shame that the left can't meme.
[1:02:53.880 --> 1:02:58.000]  As we all know, if something doesn't benefit the left, the only reasonable thing to do
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  is ban it.
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:03.680]  So you remember I mentioned that algorithm, which is able to identify harmful content
[1:03:03.680 --> 1:03:05.920]  and prevent it from being uploaded.
[1:03:05.920 --> 1:03:09.360]  Guess what the EU wants to make social media companies do?
[1:03:09.360 --> 1:03:13.560]  Develop an algorithm that can identify harmful content and prevent it from being uploaded.
[1:03:13.560 --> 1:03:19.040]  Well imagine my shock, the EU's new article 13 copyright proposal, which will be voted
[1:03:19.040 --> 1:03:24.880]  on this week, would force websites to install upload filters that would automatically censor
[1:03:24.880 --> 1:03:27.840]  any content deemed to be a copyright violation.
[1:03:27.840 --> 1:03:33.240]  This is a complete misunderstanding of both fair use and transformative content, but this
[1:03:33.240 --> 1:03:37.560]  is the EU we're talking about and they're not known for having a firm grasp of the sovereign
[1:03:37.560 --> 1:03:39.200]  interests of the individual.
[1:03:39.200 --> 1:03:43.840]  Google-owned YouTube and Facebook already have filters that block porn and copyrighted
[1:03:43.840 --> 1:03:45.760]  content before it's posted.
[1:03:45.760 --> 1:03:51.280]  So in effect, all this will achieve is a de facto ban on memes and a draconian crackdown
[1:03:51.280 --> 1:03:53.200]  on the sharing of information.
[1:03:53.200 --> 1:03:58.000]  You know, the entire foundation of how the internet is structured and what makes it work.
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:03.040]  The proposal would also institute a link tax, which would require users to get a license
[1:04:03.040 --> 1:04:08.200]  from the publisher just to include snippets from a news article like this.
[1:04:08.200 --> 1:04:12.920]  I literally wouldn't be allowed to display a screenshot from a news article like this
[1:04:12.920 --> 1:04:15.600]  without getting sued for copyright violation.
[1:04:15.600 --> 1:04:20.400]  Click the link in the description below to contact your MEP and tell them to vote against
[1:04:20.400 --> 1:04:25.360]  this absurd proposal, because if it's implemented and used as a template for other countries
[1:04:25.360 --> 1:04:30.600]  outside of the EU, the internet, as we know and love it, is finished.
[1:04:30.600 --> 1:04:36.600]  In short, Article 13 will impose widespread censorship of all the content you share online,
[1:04:36.600 --> 1:04:43.120]  be it a parody video, a remix, a meme, a blog post, comments on Reddit, a piece of code,
[1:04:43.120 --> 1:04:47.840]  live streaming your gaming experience, or even a link in a tweet.
[1:04:47.840 --> 1:04:50.480]  Spain also wants to ban memes that are...
[1:04:50.480 --> 1:04:53.800]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with a completely jam-packed transmission.
[1:04:53.800 --> 1:04:58.160]  They have now passed it through committee and are coming from the internet.
[1:04:58.160 --> 1:05:04.480]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging
[1:05:04.480 --> 1:05:10.880]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[1:05:10.880 --> 1:05:18.080]  or videos or other material from infowarsstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[1:05:18.080 --> 1:05:23.040]  I mean, I cannot say it any clear, and so it is essential that you purchase the products
[1:05:23.040 --> 1:05:24.040]  at infowarsstore.com.
[1:05:24.040 --> 1:05:27.880]  I want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with
[1:05:27.880 --> 1:05:31.560]  colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[1:05:31.560 --> 1:05:34.000]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:36.640]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[1:05:36.640 --> 1:05:39.840]  That's my dad with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[1:05:39.840 --> 1:05:43.800]  Infowarslife.com or AAA-253-3139.
[1:05:43.800 --> 1:05:48.240]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump,
[1:05:48.240 --> 1:05:51.080]  stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[1:05:51.080 --> 1:05:54.200]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back
[1:05:54.200 --> 1:06:01.360]  against us so we need your support.
[1:06:01.360 --> 1:06:06.280]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report.
[1:06:06.280 --> 1:06:17.040]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:06:17.040 --> 1:06:25.760]  Coming to you live from the Infowars.com studios in the recaptured state of Texas, it's Alex
[1:06:25.760 --> 1:06:26.760]  Jones.
[1:06:26.760 --> 1:06:32.360]  Well, there's some critical articles that you all want to see at Infowars.com and get
[1:06:32.360 --> 1:06:34.160]  out to people.
[1:06:34.160 --> 1:06:42.080]  Alania Trump called Secret Service after Peter Fonda, Peter Fonda, Peter Fonda threatens
[1:06:42.080 --> 1:06:45.880]  barren with pedophiles, says I want to kidnap you.
[1:06:45.880 --> 1:06:50.160]  I want pedophiles to have their way with you in a cage.
[1:06:50.160 --> 1:06:54.040]  I want to hack the names of the Secret Service of the ICE agents.
[1:06:54.040 --> 1:06:55.040]  I want to leak that.
[1:06:55.040 --> 1:06:56.480]  I want to harass Republicans.
[1:06:56.480 --> 1:06:59.600]  I want 90 million people in the streets.
[1:06:59.600 --> 1:07:03.720]  You've got John Cusack saying burn the facilities down.
[1:07:03.720 --> 1:07:08.840]  You've got the Democrats calling for insurrection on the news, hashtag hunt Republicans.
[1:07:08.840 --> 1:07:13.720]  This is what they want.
[1:07:13.720 --> 1:07:17.960]  First Lady Melania Trump notified the Secret Service that actor Peter Fonda threatened
[1:07:17.960 --> 1:07:22.080]  to kidnap her son Baron and throw him in a cage with pedophiles.
[1:07:22.080 --> 1:07:26.080]  The tweet is sick and irresponsible and the US Secret Service has been notified.
[1:07:26.080 --> 1:07:30.200]  First Lady spokesman said in the now deleted tweet Fonda called for Baron to be kidnapped
[1:07:30.200 --> 1:07:34.720]  and thrown in a cage with pedophiles to see if the First Lady would stand up to the President.
[1:07:34.720 --> 1:07:35.720]  Oh my gosh.
[1:07:35.720 --> 1:07:40.160]  Meanwhile, the President for years, since he got in, has said I'd like to make this
[1:07:40.160 --> 1:07:44.840]  border process when people come in even illegally better, but the Democrats won't change the
[1:07:44.840 --> 1:07:45.840]  law.
[1:07:45.840 --> 1:07:48.600]  We either can release them or process them and bring them in.
[1:07:48.600 --> 1:07:52.400]  I'm processing them and I'm not going to throw them into general population and there's
[1:07:52.400 --> 1:07:53.400]  a new video out.
[1:07:53.400 --> 1:07:55.560]  It's in the article.
[1:07:55.560 --> 1:07:56.960]  Want to keep families together.
[1:07:56.960 --> 1:07:57.960]  It's very important.
[1:07:57.960 --> 1:08:01.400]  I'm going to be signing something in a little while that's going to do that.
[1:08:01.400 --> 1:08:03.240]  President Trump says about immigration policy.
[1:08:03.240 --> 1:08:08.240]  So the Democrats have tried to divert from all the trade, gouty information and the
[1:08:08.240 --> 1:08:14.360]  stock information and the information on the FBI coming out in the IG report and the Inspector
[1:08:14.360 --> 1:08:19.960]  General's report yesterday that devastated them and showed that they were criminally
[1:08:19.960 --> 1:08:25.120]  trying to frame the Trump administration and trying to keep Trump from getting elected,
[1:08:25.120 --> 1:08:26.360]  period.
[1:08:26.360 --> 1:08:31.280]  Dems will do anything to change the subject.
[1:08:31.280 --> 1:08:36.920]  Dems will do anything not to charge them, but to obstruct what open borders, which means
[1:08:36.920 --> 1:08:37.920]  crime.
[1:08:37.920 --> 1:08:42.600]  And that's Trump also in a tweet talking about what's currently happening.
[1:08:42.600 --> 1:08:45.360]  So that story is up on infowars.com.
[1:08:45.360 --> 1:08:55.320]  It is critical, critical that people understand what's happening.
[1:08:55.320 --> 1:09:04.640]  Now there is so much for me to get to that it makes my head spin, but there's other
[1:09:04.640 --> 1:09:12.040]  critical videos on infowars.com like U.S. school kids wish they had the same lunches as migrant
[1:09:12.040 --> 1:09:13.040]  children.
[1:09:13.040 --> 1:09:16.880]  And we compare the school lunch programs that Obama put in that are still in place, by the
[1:09:16.880 --> 1:09:22.840]  way, that feed people the most horrible, gruel, total scams worse than supermax prisons to
[1:09:22.840 --> 1:09:29.480]  American school children of every color versus what the children are being fed in official
[1:09:29.480 --> 1:09:36.040]  videos inside the migrant centers, where they have the X boxes and all the rest of a very,
[1:09:36.040 --> 1:09:39.320]  very important report by my son Rex Jones.
[1:09:39.320 --> 1:09:44.040]  And you need to get this out to everybody because we're in an information war, ladies
[1:09:44.040 --> 1:10:02.920]  and gentlemen, we are in a serious, serious information war with these globalist now.
[1:10:02.920 --> 1:10:11.920]  The time we have left in this segment, let me give you the bad news, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:10:11.920 --> 1:10:18.320]  In the time we have left here, we've talked about articles in the new legislation that
[1:10:18.320 --> 1:10:21.840]  the EU is trying to ram through.
[1:10:21.840 --> 1:10:24.920]  Now they have a bureaucracy that actually makes the laws.
[1:10:24.920 --> 1:10:28.760]  The parliament then decides whether it's going to certify it or not, but that can then be
[1:10:28.760 --> 1:10:34.040]  overridden by the permanent bureaucracy.
[1:10:34.040 --> 1:10:44.960]  And so the bad news is, EU votes yes on meme ban, censorship machines, and link tax, what
[1:10:44.960 --> 1:10:45.960]  now?
[1:10:45.960 --> 1:10:48.600]  Now, that's the next web.
[1:10:48.600 --> 1:10:55.080]  That's a big establishment respecting tech and internet publication.
[1:10:55.080 --> 1:10:58.520]  And the next web is attack me.
[1:10:58.520 --> 1:11:01.760]  So you've also got the London Independent saying the same thing.
[1:11:01.760 --> 1:11:05.040]  EU committee approves new rules that could destroy the internet as we know it.
[1:11:05.040 --> 1:11:06.040]  Close quote.
[1:11:06.040 --> 1:11:11.400]  So see, I first covered this, this was the TPP like five years ago, and they went, oh,
[1:11:11.400 --> 1:11:15.440]  Alex, quit being such a fair monger because I actually had talked to folks that knew what
[1:11:15.440 --> 1:11:16.920]  was being negotiated.
[1:11:16.920 --> 1:11:24.000]  Then we got a leaked copy two years ago and then Trump killed it when he was in office
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:26.520]  three days.
[1:11:26.520 --> 1:11:33.480]  Now they've taken the exact same stuff and they put it in there and you notice this is
[1:11:33.480 --> 1:11:41.840]  a tech publication telling you that the browsers, the web services, the web servers, the systems
[1:11:41.840 --> 1:11:50.440]  where you upload your website, every platform under EU law, imagine the bureaucracy of this,
[1:11:50.440 --> 1:11:58.600]  must then be approved by the EU and then you must add to the software systems that allow
[1:11:58.600 --> 1:12:07.480]  them in live time in an example they use to see Pepe the frog and to say that's a symbol
[1:12:07.480 --> 1:12:14.720]  of hate and that you're not licensed to use it, even though it's fair use and open communication,
[1:12:14.720 --> 1:12:17.680]  and that it's then banned and you cannot upload it.
[1:12:17.680 --> 1:12:21.320]  Now they already have this technology when you go on YouTube and want to upload music
[1:12:21.320 --> 1:12:25.440]  or something, but this is going to be to your speech and to your words.
[1:12:25.440 --> 1:12:29.720]  And Soros Foundation, I had stronger internet regulation in TPP.
[1:12:29.720 --> 1:12:34.600]  That was two years ago, we reported on that and Breitbart reported on it.
[1:12:34.600 --> 1:12:40.640]  So Soros is in charge of this and he financed 20,000 people trained by the Southern Poverty
[1:12:40.640 --> 1:12:51.040]  Law Center, Snopes, and then some mail order diploma group out of Florida, I'm not kidding,
[1:12:51.040 --> 1:12:59.040]  that then programs the computers already at Facebook, Twitter, Google and YouTube to control
[1:12:59.040 --> 1:13:03.680]  what you can upload, what you can do and now they're just going to move that onto browsers
[1:13:03.680 --> 1:13:14.000]  and on the internet platforms and on the server systems where you cannot even take a quote
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:19.200]  someone has said if it's put in a newspaper and they claim they own it, no judge, no jury,
[1:13:19.200 --> 1:13:23.800]  the mega corporations are allowed to say they own everything, they're allowed to data
[1:13:23.800 --> 1:13:30.400]  mine and track everything you do via the EU all in the name of privacy, but then you are
[1:13:30.400 --> 1:13:34.080]  under EU control and have no rights.
[1:13:34.080 --> 1:13:36.440]  Now that sounds unbelievable, doesn't it?
[1:13:36.440 --> 1:13:38.920]  It is, it's happening, it's called tyranny.
[1:13:38.920 --> 1:13:47.880]  Here's even the next web, EU votes yes on meme ban, censorship, machines and link tax,
[1:13:47.880 --> 1:13:51.120]  money to even link to someone and do them a favor.
[1:13:51.120 --> 1:13:54.360]  Oh, look at the New York Times, we've got an interesting review of this film, here's
[1:13:54.360 --> 1:13:55.360]  the link.
[1:13:55.360 --> 1:13:59.280]  Oh sorry, you've got to pay us to do that.
[1:13:59.280 --> 1:14:00.680]  It's breaking the internet.
[1:14:00.680 --> 1:14:05.360]  Oh, you have to go through an interface that censors and controls what you can say and
[1:14:05.360 --> 1:14:10.600]  what you can do and then it's programmed by George Soros's people.
[1:14:10.600 --> 1:14:14.720]  I mean this is like godlike control, so they already got the leftist in Twitter, Facebook,
[1:14:14.720 --> 1:14:18.920]  YouTube, everywhere censoring Alex Jones and saying he's the test case, remember just
[1:14:18.920 --> 1:14:23.320]  a few months ago, the Wall Street Journal, but then once they've set that test case,
[1:14:23.320 --> 1:14:31.920]  it rolls out against everybody, but you can't get any of the so-called new blessed conservatives
[1:14:31.920 --> 1:14:37.160]  that are kind of like leftist versions of patriots to cover it.
[1:14:37.160 --> 1:14:41.000]  They're all just like, well, Alex is getting censored, that's good for us, we get all the
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:47.600]  attention now when you're all going to be next and it's pathetic, it's absolutely ridiculous.
[1:14:47.600 --> 1:14:53.280]  Everyone should be rallying against this and people also go, well, that's the EU, oh no,
[1:14:53.280 --> 1:14:55.440]  we're already under the EU regulations.
[1:14:55.440 --> 1:14:59.960]  So Trump, the answer is Trump needs to pull out of all these treaties, he needs to say
[1:14:59.960 --> 1:15:05.080]  no, the EU is predatory, it's out of control, it's the same Twitter, Facebook, all of them
[1:15:05.080 --> 1:15:11.840]  censoring his son, censoring him, Silicon Valley, Communist China and the EU are all
[1:15:11.840 --> 1:15:17.560]  going along with this together, happily skipping down the road with classic mass control and
[1:15:17.560 --> 1:15:23.720]  censorship and a new editor class that stands between you and anything you can write or
[1:15:23.720 --> 1:15:28.720]  say or do even on your own message board.
[1:15:28.720 --> 1:15:33.200]  First they taught us to accept censorship on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Google, everybody
[1:15:33.200 --> 1:15:39.120]  said that's their company, they can do that if they want and now it's coming to everybody
[1:15:39.120 --> 1:15:42.840]  just like Matt Grudge warned you here in studio a few years ago, just like I keep warning
[1:15:42.840 --> 1:15:43.840]  you over and over again.
[1:15:43.840 --> 1:15:48.400]  Now it's past article 11 and 13 out of the committee and it's going to the full vote
[1:15:48.400 --> 1:15:53.960]  and reportedly they have the EU votes to break the internet as we know it, you can't make
[1:15:53.960 --> 1:15:57.600]  that up.
[1:15:57.600 --> 1:15:59.960]  Want revenge on the common house fly?
[1:15:59.960 --> 1:16:05.560]  Well, after 10,000 years someone has finally come up with a better way, the bug assault,

[1:17:01.840 --> 1:17:03.040]  nowhere to go?
[1:17:03.040 --> 1:17:05.240]  The answer is the Biffy bag.

[1:17:26.760 --> 1:17:28.920]  You have been lied to.
[1:17:28.920 --> 1:17:30.520]  My name is Kevin Ship.
[1:17:30.520 --> 1:17:33.640]  I'm a former decorated CIA officer.
[1:17:33.640 --> 1:17:37.400]  Many someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-Mose on the shadow
[1:17:37.400 --> 1:17:38.400]  government ever.
[1:17:38.400 --> 1:17:43.320]  We're in a constitutional crisis, and our government is now being run and ruled by a
[1:17:43.320 --> 1:17:44.320]  shadow government.
[1:17:44.320 --> 1:17:47.160]  We've got to get this out because just because you're awake, folks, doesn't mean other people
[1:17:47.160 --> 1:17:48.160]  are.

[1:18:37.160 --> 1:18:41.800]  root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[1:18:41.800 --> 1:18:47.840]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme

[1:20:30.440 --> 1:20:34.800]  Well, I got some bad news for everybody.
[1:20:34.800 --> 1:20:40.920]  EU votes yes on meme ban, censorship machines, I'm gonna break down exactly what that is,
[1:20:40.920 --> 1:20:42.720]  and link tax.
[1:20:42.720 --> 1:20:46.240]  What's coming next, ladies and gentlemen?
[1:20:46.240 --> 1:20:47.240]  What's coming next?
[1:20:47.240 --> 1:20:51.280]  We're gonna be breaking that down coming up and how do we fight it?
[1:20:51.280 --> 1:20:54.440]  How do we defeat it?
[1:20:54.440 --> 1:20:58.120]  We mobilize against it, we have the nation state to pull out of it and announce that
[1:20:58.120 --> 1:21:00.160]  we're not following it.
[1:21:00.160 --> 1:21:06.640]  But again, it's the big blocks of countries with communist China, the EU openly working
[1:21:06.640 --> 1:21:12.040]  with the big global tech companies to unify the censorship, the global social scores,
[1:21:12.040 --> 1:21:18.840]  the censorship database interfaces that all internet computer devices will go through
[1:21:18.840 --> 1:21:24.840]  run by George Soros Financed Southern Poverty Law Center Group.
[1:21:24.840 --> 1:21:29.560]  Now you know why Southern Poverty Law Center has a billion dollars in slush funds offshore.
[1:21:29.560 --> 1:21:31.800]  This is big.
[1:21:31.800 --> 1:21:39.040]  And even liberal publications are saying this will break the internet as we know it.
[1:21:39.040 --> 1:21:45.680]  Now, we have a special guest joining us in the next segment, we'll also get to more of
[1:21:45.680 --> 1:21:48.080]  the amazing hearing after today.
[1:21:48.080 --> 1:21:51.360]  Now we learned that there have been crimes committed and that they were trying to frame
[1:21:51.360 --> 1:21:54.600]  the president and trying to stop him from winning and then trying to set him up for
[1:21:54.600 --> 1:21:58.640]  Russiagate by a bunch of Democratic Party operatives just like we already knew.
[1:21:58.640 --> 1:22:04.160]  But now it's front and center and now the talking point is there, justice must be done,
[1:22:04.160 --> 1:22:06.560]  they must be locked up.
[1:22:06.560 --> 1:22:09.600]  We're hearing Comey's name, McCabe's name, not just Strock.
[1:22:09.600 --> 1:22:16.920]  So as I told you, the dominoes are falling, the indictments are already prepared, but
[1:22:16.920 --> 1:22:20.280]  they're just educating the public and getting you ready for it first.
[1:22:20.280 --> 1:22:22.800]  Trump is not business as usual.
[1:22:22.800 --> 1:22:25.960]  He's come out in the video, we'll play in a moment and said that he never has really
[1:22:25.960 --> 1:22:28.640]  been a fan of the deep state, he did it himself.
[1:22:28.640 --> 1:22:31.680]  He isn't part of the good old boy club, the white shoe boy club, he's not.
[1:22:31.680 --> 1:22:35.520]  He's called a maverick and a pro-American maverick at that.
[1:22:35.520 --> 1:22:41.800]  But I'll tell you who the bad guys are, we're going to play these clips, it's up on infowars.com.
[1:22:41.800 --> 1:22:47.680]  Former Trump conservatives want to replace pro-Trump Republicans with illegal immigrants.
[1:22:47.680 --> 1:22:49.840]  And there's a whole bunch of them.
[1:22:49.840 --> 1:22:57.000]  We got Bill Crystal, we got all these other folks writing for the Washington Post, Max
[1:22:57.000 --> 1:23:01.880]  Boot, the neocon, and who are these folks?
[1:23:01.880 --> 1:23:07.960]  Well Trotsky got hit in the head with a ice axe, the old Asia, they had big places that
[1:23:07.960 --> 1:23:10.080]  made the ice and had to hack them up with an axe.
[1:23:10.080 --> 1:23:14.640]  He got killed in Mexico, so all the little commies ran up to the U.S. and took over the
[1:23:14.640 --> 1:23:19.040]  University of Chicago with big banker money out of New York.
[1:23:19.040 --> 1:23:21.440]  And they are the Trotskyites and they said, how do we beat America?
[1:23:21.440 --> 1:23:26.240]  And they said, we become the conservatives, that's how we defeat the anti-communist.
[1:23:26.240 --> 1:23:30.240]  And then the one or other Republican party was so bad because they've been running it.
[1:23:30.240 --> 1:23:36.400]  Well they're being removed like a face sucker from Alien 3 off the old face.
[1:23:36.400 --> 1:23:37.400]  And they are.
[1:23:37.400 --> 1:23:39.480]  P.O.'d big time.
[1:23:39.480 --> 1:23:44.560]  So we got a bunch of these clips, chronicle, but let's play that Bill Crystal clip with
[1:23:44.560 --> 1:23:50.240]  him on C-Span making jokes about it about, you know, these lazy, stupid, bad white people.
[1:23:50.240 --> 1:23:56.280]  Wow, that's like Harvard came out, they got sued, had to release their internal systems
[1:23:56.280 --> 1:24:00.520]  of how they score, whether you can be led or not.
[1:24:00.520 --> 1:24:05.000]  And to keep Asians out, they don't score in academics as much now, that's only one-third
[1:24:05.000 --> 1:24:06.000]  of it.
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:12.680]  They don't have attitude and culture and on humor and on humanity, the humanities.
[1:24:12.680 --> 1:24:16.120]  And they said Asians don't have souls basically.
[1:24:16.120 --> 1:24:19.160]  And CNN had an article this weekend defending it.
[1:24:19.160 --> 1:24:24.680]  Well, they scored them and said, they don't do with humor, humanity or, you know, with
[1:24:24.680 --> 1:24:28.520]  social stuff, no, they do fine.
[1:24:28.520 --> 1:24:32.160]  They're just not running around glad-handing everybody on average, they don't know.
[1:24:32.160 --> 1:24:36.200]  They're busy trying to get the degree, get out of there.
[1:24:36.200 --> 1:24:39.240]  But again, we have a communist.
[1:24:39.240 --> 1:24:44.240]  His father became the head Trotskyite after Trotsky was killed and then he was given the
[1:24:44.240 --> 1:24:48.520]  mantle and all the money and all the stuff, reportedly that the Trotskyites had gotten
[1:24:48.520 --> 1:24:51.480]  out of Russia.
[1:24:51.480 --> 1:24:53.680]  Just like the Bushes said on top of a lot of the Nazi wealth, because they were the
[1:24:53.680 --> 1:24:59.000]  head Prescott for the Nazis, that's been a major one and guardian, you name it.
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:02.320]  We broke it first, of course, from the Library of Congress documents that weren't declassified
[1:25:02.320 --> 1:25:06.840]  until 2000 for the McCormick-Dickstein committee.
[1:25:06.840 --> 1:25:11.800]  But this guy's got Russian money, reportedly his whole, what are all these commies show
[1:25:11.800 --> 1:25:18.000]  up, they take over, they're the conservatives, they're going to lead us, oh, oh, oh Mr. Crystal,
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  thank you.
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:20.000]  You're such an intellectual.
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  You just sit back.
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:28.960]  You look at him, he sits back, oh, I'm so smart, oh, I'm so intellectual, I'm so intelligent.
[1:25:28.960 --> 1:25:31.640]  I sit at my knee, I will tell you.
[1:25:31.640 --> 1:25:34.320]  So let's go ahead and go to his lordship.
[1:25:34.320 --> 1:25:35.320]  Here he is.
[1:25:35.320 --> 1:25:39.200]  Look, to be totally honest, if things are so bad, as you say with a white working class,
[1:25:39.200 --> 1:25:45.000]  don't you want to get new Americans in who aren't going to be, I'm serious, you can make
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:48.280]  a case that this is going on too long and this is too crazy, probably, and I hope this
[1:25:48.280 --> 1:25:53.720]  thing isn't being like, you know, videotaped or ever shown anywhere, whatever tiny pathetic
[1:25:53.720 --> 1:25:56.640]  future I have is going to be totally collapsed.
[1:25:56.640 --> 1:26:00.760]  You can make a case that America has become, has been great because every, every, I think
[1:26:00.760 --> 1:26:02.800]  John Adams said this at the beginning, right?
[1:26:02.800 --> 1:26:06.720]  Basically if you're in a free society, a capitalist society, after two, three, four generations
[1:26:06.720 --> 1:26:11.120]  of hard work, everyone becomes kind of decadent, lazy, spoiled, whatever.
[1:26:11.120 --> 1:26:15.080]  And then you, luckily, you have these waves of people coming in from Italy and Ireland
[1:26:15.080 --> 1:26:20.200]  and Russia and now Mexico who really want to work hard and really want to succeed and
[1:26:20.200 --> 1:26:23.960]  really want their kids to live better lives than them and aren't sort of clipping coupons
[1:26:23.960 --> 1:26:29.320]  or hoping that they can hang on and meanwhile, okay, so that's a way over simplification
[1:26:29.320 --> 1:26:33.160]  and then he throws it in like it's white people.
[1:26:33.160 --> 1:26:36.800]  When you have massive corruption and problems in Latin America and a lot of failed societies
[1:26:36.800 --> 1:26:38.240]  and systems, are there some good people?
[1:26:38.240 --> 1:26:39.240]  Yeah.
[1:26:39.240 --> 1:26:40.240]  Are there some bad people?
[1:26:40.240 --> 1:26:41.240]  Absolutely.
[1:26:41.240 --> 1:26:43.840]  And then when Trump says you got a lot of criminals coming in, we got to vet them, they go, oh,
[1:26:43.840 --> 1:26:46.120]  he called all Hispanics criminals.
[1:26:46.120 --> 1:26:50.360]  So it's this, it's this, it's this deception, but he just kind of throws in the lazy white
[1:26:50.360 --> 1:26:53.600]  people, the, you know, the white people and he goes on and says more.
[1:26:53.600 --> 1:26:56.440]  But now it's gotten worse.
[1:26:56.440 --> 1:27:01.040]  Max Boot and Jennifer Rubin have openly expressed their desire to see pro-Trump Republicans
[1:27:01.040 --> 1:27:02.520]  replaced with legal immigrants.
[1:27:02.520 --> 1:27:06.600]  Writing for the Washington Post, this is the Democrat strategy as well, Neocon Globalist
[1:27:06.600 --> 1:27:12.640]  Boot wrote, if only we could keep the hardworking Latin American newcomers and deport the contentable
[1:27:12.640 --> 1:27:16.480]  Republican cowards, that would truly enhance America's greatness.
[1:27:16.480 --> 1:27:22.800]  And then they go on from there with quote after quote, oh, such cowards, such bad people
[1:27:22.800 --> 1:27:27.320]  because we don't just let like Obama did the last few years, random groups of children
[1:27:27.320 --> 1:27:33.000]  unaccompanied in some cases, be loaded on buses of the Catholic church and, and of democratic
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:37.080]  groups and just of random child smuggling groups, the Washington Post reported, oh,
[1:27:37.080 --> 1:27:44.280]  there's a hunter to you here, just buy, just wander on off.
[1:27:44.280 --> 1:27:47.120]  This is what's going on and it's, it's, it's out of control.
[1:27:47.120 --> 1:27:50.480]  And then they know we've got such a big heart, they go, oh, you're mean here, let us play
[1:27:50.480 --> 1:27:53.800]  you some more audio and video of children crying.
[1:27:53.800 --> 1:27:54.800]  Now we're going to break.
[1:27:54.800 --> 1:27:59.360]  They have a special guest joining us coming up and I'll just leave it as a surprise.

[1:30:03.480 --> 1:30:04.480]  Thanks for holding.
[1:30:04.480 --> 1:30:05.480]  Hey Alex, mate.
[1:30:05.480 --> 1:30:09.080]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[1:30:09.080 --> 1:30:14.160]  I remember back when Info Wars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen
[1:30:14.160 --> 1:30:18.560]  and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was pretty cool.
[1:30:18.560 --> 1:30:22.680]  I've read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests and I've
[1:30:22.680 --> 1:30:26.880]  been using your products since the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then

[1:30:33.440 --> 1:30:34.440]  all amazing.
[1:30:34.440 --> 1:30:35.440]  Thank you, brother.
[1:30:35.440 --> 1:30:40.400]  I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind,
[1:30:40.400 --> 1:30:44.520]  you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit and it's just the more you know
[1:30:44.520 --> 1:30:49.520]  God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God and I wanted to say that it's an

[1:30:58.560 --> 1:31:03.160]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home, but sometimes

[1:31:58.240 --> 1:32:02.620]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[1:32:02.620 --> 1:32:07.320]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[1:32:07.320 --> 1:32:08.840]  to detoxify the body.
[1:32:08.840 --> 1:32:13.720]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[1:32:13.720 --> 1:32:15.240]  It's made in the USA.
[1:32:15.240 --> 1:32:20.160]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[1:32:20.160 --> 1:32:22.000]  the body and it supports the InfoWars.
[1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:24.240]  It is a classical 360 win.
[1:32:24.240 --> 1:32:27.800]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[1:32:27.800 --> 1:32:32.680]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as
[1:32:32.680 --> 1:32:33.680]  you can possibly get.
[1:32:33.680 --> 1:32:37.600]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this
[1:32:37.600 --> 1:32:42.640]  country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[1:32:42.640 --> 1:32:47.880]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[1:32:47.880 --> 1:32:50.560]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[1:32:50.560 --> 1:32:53.880]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[1:32:53.880 --> 1:33:01.440]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield InfoWarsLive.com.
[1:33:01.440 --> 1:33:07.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:33:07.400 --> 1:33:11.560]  A lot of his supporters believe that we are the enemy of the American people and that
[1:33:11.560 --> 1:33:14.440]  is really, really an awful situation.
[1:33:14.440 --> 1:33:16.680]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[1:33:16.680 --> 1:33:29.240]  We love the American people.
[1:33:29.240 --> 1:33:31.480]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[1:33:31.480 --> 1:33:33.000]  We love the American people.
[1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:34.000]  We love the American people.
[1:33:34.000 --> 1:33:35.000]  We love the American people.
[1:33:35.000 --> 1:33:36.000]  They came in peace.
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:54.880]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[1:33:54.880 --> 1:34:04.200]  We love the American people.
[1:34:04.200 --> 1:34:09.600]  This is CNN.
[1:34:09.600 --> 1:34:14.200]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:34:14.200 --> 1:34:27.320]  There is a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[1:34:27.320 --> 1:34:28.320]  Alex Jones.
[1:34:28.320 --> 1:34:41.440]  The far-right conspiracy theorist who was a parent.
[1:34:41.440 --> 1:34:42.440]  Alex Jones.
[1:34:42.440 --> 1:34:43.440]  Scott.
[1:34:43.440 --> 1:34:44.440]  Russian.
[1:34:44.440 --> 1:34:45.440]  Scott.
[1:34:45.440 --> 1:34:46.440]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[1:34:46.440 --> 1:34:47.440]  Reputation is amazing.
[1:34:47.440 --> 1:35:06.480]  I will not let you down, you will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[1:35:06.480 --> 1:35:09.720]  We will open the phones up and take a ton of calls in the third hour because I know you
[1:35:09.720 --> 1:35:16.080]  want to talk about all the things that are happening, Space Force, the Democrats running
[1:35:16.080 --> 1:35:23.920]  this giant hoax that Trump is abusing children when it is the opposite, Hollywood saying
[1:35:23.920 --> 1:35:39.320]  burn down the immigrant centers, Henry Fonda's deranged loser son coming out, Peter Fonda,
[1:35:39.320 --> 1:35:48.440]  saying kidnap Baron Trump, put him in a cage to be raped by pedophiles, harass the children
[1:35:48.440 --> 1:35:53.680]  of Border Patrol agents, Latin America is collapsing, hundreds of thousands have been
[1:35:53.680 --> 1:35:57.600]  killed in Mexico alone, they are eating their dogs three or four years ago, the dogs were
[1:35:57.600 --> 1:36:04.160]  already gone in Venezuela, and it is all pouring in here, 80% of the women are raped
[1:36:04.160 --> 1:36:08.280]  on the Mexico side, we are not doing that.
[1:36:08.280 --> 1:36:11.200]  And then you get all these thousands of people and you go, okay, we are going to vet who
[1:36:11.200 --> 1:36:16.080]  you are, kids over here, women here, men here, inside these big old facilities with chain
[1:36:16.080 --> 1:36:21.280]  link between you, you can't put the kids in with the pedophiles, that is not what Trump
[1:36:21.280 --> 1:36:29.640]  is doing, he is doing the opposite, but Fonda, he comes out and says, but that is what they
[1:36:29.640 --> 1:36:36.240]  want to do to Baron as if he deserves that, and then the DHS head gets run out of a Mexican
[1:36:36.240 --> 1:36:41.040]  food restaurant by a bunch of people chanting racist and shame on you, they are weaponizing
[1:36:41.040 --> 1:36:48.760]  the Democrats and getting them into a crazed hateful out of control mode, and the idiot
[1:36:48.760 --> 1:36:50.960]  followers that go along with this are unbelievable.
[1:36:50.960 --> 1:36:55.200]  Now I am really impressed with the gentleman we have got on with us, the amazing Lucas
[1:36:55.200 --> 1:36:59.960]  and he is amazing, I have seen his 3D character animations, I have seen the effect that he
[1:36:59.960 --> 1:37:05.040]  is 2016 muscle classic physique champion, the muscle classic, that is one of the biggest
[1:37:05.040 --> 1:37:10.200]  ones out there, and of course, previously a personal trainer, the amazing Lucas on
[1:37:10.200 --> 1:37:16.560]  Instagram, Twitter, I am amazing Lucas, YouTube the amazing Lucas, and I am telling you, his
[1:37:16.560 --> 1:37:23.000]  videos are powerful, we have aired some of them here, but here he is with us in the flash
[1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:27.120]  via Skype to get into whatever he wants to cover, it is great to have you here with us,
[1:37:27.120 --> 1:37:28.120]  thanks for joining us.
[1:37:28.120 --> 1:37:31.280]  Hi, thanks for having me on the show, Alex.
[1:37:31.280 --> 1:37:36.120]  What do you want to tackle first, the insanity of what is going on, what is your view of
[1:37:36.120 --> 1:37:40.400]  this thing where we are following a 20 year old policy, but Trump is actually enforcing
[1:37:40.400 --> 1:37:45.400]  it, wouldn't it be child abuse just to let a bunch of people randomly go with random
[1:37:45.400 --> 1:37:47.680]  adults, you have no idea who they are?
[1:37:47.680 --> 1:37:54.960]  You are 100% correct, but I think everything Parkinson's back to is a quote from Voltaire,
[1:37:54.960 --> 1:38:01.920]  what he states is once you make people believe absurdities, you can make them commit atrocities,
[1:38:01.920 --> 1:38:08.480]  I think that is what is taking place, everything from Steve Scalise shooting to Antifa to more
[1:38:08.480 --> 1:38:14.240]  presently Kirsten Nielsen, who was yelled out of a restaurant, and I think what we are
[1:38:14.240 --> 1:38:20.560]  seeing right now is exactly what your channel is, an info war, because people are listening
[1:38:20.560 --> 1:38:25.240]  to the media and what they are saying, and when I was trying to go on Google to research
[1:38:25.240 --> 1:38:29.080]  what the facts of the issues were, it was all saying Trump is separating families, Trump
[1:38:29.080 --> 1:38:30.080]  is separating families.
[1:38:30.080 --> 1:38:33.440]  Going to the second page, the third page, the fourth page, and they are built to results
[1:38:33.440 --> 1:38:38.400]  just as they did during the 2016 election, and it's gotten to the point where I can't
[1:38:38.400 --> 1:38:42.720]  blame people who are acting out now, because if you actually believe that this man is Hitler,
[1:38:42.720 --> 1:38:48.440]  then of course you should do everything in your power to take him out of the Oval Office,
[1:38:48.440 --> 1:38:51.920]  and the thing is that's what these people actually believe, it's the same thing with
[1:38:51.920 --> 1:38:56.560]  the LGBT and the transsexual, back in the day if someone were on the street corner saying
[1:38:56.560 --> 1:39:03.000]  I'm an airplane, you know what, we need to get you some help, nowadays you'd have a lefty,
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:07.600]  you'd go up, there's a helicopter pad right over there, do you need something I can build
[1:39:07.600 --> 1:39:12.520]  a hovercraft or something for you so you can fly, and that's what it's gotten to, there's
[1:39:12.520 --> 1:39:19.160]  a place of coming to just ask nine soft history, that's what it's gotten to, I think it's actually
[1:39:19.160 --> 1:39:25.160]  a sick moment in time where this country is, we'll have to fight the media.
[1:39:25.160 --> 1:39:30.080]  I am speechless, the way you boiled that down, amazing Lucas, is amazing, because they now
[1:39:30.080 --> 1:39:34.520]  have people at Google, you're not joking, the Google execs make people get an AmpliFeeder,
[1:39:34.520 --> 1:39:39.200]  over 300 of them, it's in the lawsuit, Google admits it, and worship the vice president
[1:39:39.200 --> 1:39:45.080]  as a beautiful ornate building and a female dragon, a dragonette, and people think that's
[1:39:45.080 --> 1:39:49.120]  abusive, hell yeah that is, hey if you want to be, you've heard how we're having to pay
[1:39:49.120 --> 1:39:53.560]  in England and the US, in some jurisdictions people identify as blind, so they're dumping
[1:39:53.560 --> 1:39:57.920]  Drano in their eyes, a psychiatrist is, and then we have to pay for them, no, if you want
[1:39:57.920 --> 1:40:02.600]  to get rid of your eyeballs, you need to be in a rubber room in a straight jacket so you
[1:40:02.600 --> 1:40:03.920]  don't hurt yourself.
[1:40:03.920 --> 1:40:10.920]  Alex, that's hate speech, you need to watch what you're saying, I mean anytime, what I
[1:40:10.920 --> 1:40:15.240]  call them is hate facts, and once you post these hate facts that completely contradicts
[1:40:15.240 --> 1:40:20.120]  what these people believe, what their whole foundation, their whole reality is rooted
[1:40:20.120 --> 1:40:23.880]  in, well you have two options, they either acknowledge what you're saying is truth, or
[1:40:23.880 --> 1:40:27.960]  they walk away, or simply what's going on right now, you have the xenophobic, the bigot
[1:40:27.960 --> 1:40:34.960]  thing, homophobic, transphobic, the racist, the massages, all of these terms to silence
[1:40:34.960 --> 1:40:38.800]  people, to center them, so they don't have to listen to what you're saying.
[1:40:38.800 --> 1:40:42.520]  And you're right, and why are the big megacorporations funding it, because I want to get your take
[1:40:42.520 --> 1:40:46.280]  on that because they know they can't compete with a free market, they can't get control,
[1:40:46.280 --> 1:40:50.400]  but if they teach mental illness in the schools and the colleges and make us all accept it,
[1:40:50.400 --> 1:40:55.000]  they can create a totally dysfunctional society that they as the high priest then can navigate
[1:40:55.000 --> 1:40:59.880]  and referee and control and decide what mental illness is kosher, what mental illness is
[1:40:59.880 --> 1:41:01.400]  Prasada Nangrata, go ahead.
[1:41:01.400 --> 1:41:07.520]  You're 100% correct Alex, I mean we can see this more prominently within the black community,
[1:41:07.520 --> 1:41:12.360]  how they completely crippled them, I mean you can see how they're doing it in the schools,
[1:41:12.360 --> 1:41:16.280]  what they've done in the black community, they want, as I always say, white liberals
[1:41:16.280 --> 1:41:20.720]  want to keep blacks dumb, and they want to keep them poor, they want to keep them dumb,
[1:41:20.720 --> 1:41:23.640]  they want to keep them poor so they're upset, they want to keep them dumb so they don't
[1:41:23.640 --> 1:41:28.440]  know why they're upset, so when they get upset, what do white liberals do, who they plant?
[1:41:28.440 --> 1:41:32.600]  Look at those conservatives over there, they're the reason that you're poor, they're the reason
[1:41:32.600 --> 1:41:38.360]  that you are where you are, don't worry about the vouchers, don't worry about getting vouchers
[1:41:38.360 --> 1:41:43.400]  to get better education, don't worry about that, don't worry about reforming the welfare
[1:41:43.400 --> 1:41:49.400]  state, no, no, get you guys on welfare, we need that, and I'm like for what, for votes?
[1:41:49.400 --> 1:41:53.000]  They've done this time and time again, so let's say we do get the vouchers, now what?
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:57.240]  Now we get into higher education, they're implanted there, they're completely ingenious,
[1:41:57.240 --> 1:42:01.640]  we have these liberal professors in these schools, not talking to students who go to
[1:42:01.640 --> 1:42:05.960]  UCLA, USC, my sister went to USC, she just recently graduated from law school, and you
[1:42:05.960 --> 1:42:09.880]  have these liberal professors who are not teaching, they're indoctrinated, and they're
[1:42:09.880 --> 1:42:13.960]  smart, they're not worrying about adults because they're focusing on the children, they say
[1:42:13.960 --> 1:42:19.000]  no, that's where they're putting their money in, and you gotta fight, you have to, that's
[1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:23.000]  the only reason I had to speak up, because it got to a point where the inauguration happened,
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:27.960]  and they said, oh, his inauguration speech was very shitlers, very dictator, I was like,
[1:42:27.960 --> 1:42:31.160]  that's strange, I've never heard that from a president, you know, someone talking about
[1:42:31.160 --> 1:42:33.880]  a president that way, and then it got to another point where they're talking about
[1:42:33.880 --> 1:42:38.280]  crowd size, I'm like, that's strange, because the video I saw, there was a big crowd size,
[1:42:38.280 --> 1:42:42.840]  and then it got to the MLK, oh, he removed the MLK bus, he's a racist, he's a racist,
[1:42:42.840 --> 1:42:44.840]  fake news.
[1:42:44.840 --> 1:42:48.280]  Exactly, wow, I want to hear what made you activate and become political, because you're
[1:42:48.280 --> 1:42:51.960]  smart, and again, they're pushing people, it would just be out there having a regular job
[1:42:51.960 --> 1:42:54.920]  into politics for survival, he's amazing, we'll be back.

[1:44:18.760 --> 1:44:25.080]  We employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH. What we learned was that
[1:44:25.080 --> 1:44:29.240]  there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[1:44:29.880 --> 1:44:35.080]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter, and not only were the heavy
[1:44:35.080 --> 1:44:40.360]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[1:44:40.920 --> 1:44:47.080]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water. So what we've learned
[1:44:47.080 --> 1:44:53.240]  is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply. But more importantly,
[1:44:53.240 --> 1:44:55.960]  a good water filtration system will purify it.
[1:44:58.040 --> 1:45:04.440]  Fueling your body is hard work. That's why we've introduced the InfoWars Life Daily Digestive Pack

[1:46:55.560 --> 1:47:07.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:25.640 --> 1:47:32.440]  Well, the amazing Lucas is amazing, and I just started seeing his videos about six months ago,
[1:47:33.080 --> 1:47:37.000]  and that's why I wanted to get him on, but he was busy a few weeks ago that I don't want
[1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:41.560]  on vacation. We got him now, and let me tell you something, I find it very interesting.
[1:47:41.560 --> 1:47:48.760]  Somebody like the amazing Lucas, who is, I mean, Fox News ready right now, basically,
[1:47:48.760 --> 1:47:52.600]  but they wouldn't have him on because he'd wake many people up. I mean, he's got it, and it's
[1:47:52.600 --> 1:47:57.480]  so interesting how he was saying it was the unreality that made him go public. I was at the
[1:47:57.480 --> 1:48:05.080]  inauguration five rows out, but it was so close up under the president I couldn't see the speakers.
[1:48:06.040 --> 1:48:10.600]  Okay, I mean, my seat was the front row if you weren't in the actual group up on top,
[1:48:10.600 --> 1:48:15.560]  but then you're looking up 30 feet, I could just barely even see it. So you can see me in the famous,
[1:48:15.560 --> 1:48:19.480]  maybe they can pull it up, CNN megapixel photo, where it's like hundreds of megapixels,
[1:48:19.480 --> 1:48:23.080]  where they took a photo from behind the president, you see it going all the way back one of the
[1:48:23.080 --> 1:48:29.480]  biggest crowds ever. And you can see me right back, there's a few deals looking right there at the
[1:48:29.480 --> 1:48:36.120]  president. So I'm like 50 yards away. Now, the reason I say that is I got upset when CNN
[1:48:37.080 --> 1:48:44.600]  showed when they first opened the doors. And, and communists were trying to not let people in
[1:48:44.600 --> 1:48:48.120]  and antifa, I was there, I physically got in fights with them, I saw them beat women up.
[1:48:48.120 --> 1:48:52.520]  And then they showed when it first opened up and so did the MSNBC and BBC and said,
[1:48:52.520 --> 1:48:58.600]  no one was there. No one was there. No one was there. No, I was there. It was a record crowd.
[1:48:58.600 --> 1:49:03.240]  It took hours and hours and hours to get in. I had to fight. There's video of it to get in.
[1:49:03.240 --> 1:49:06.840]  And then they didn't just try to steal my right to be there, like a bunch of thugs,
[1:49:06.840 --> 1:49:11.640]  they lied about what happened. And, and the amazing Lucas said that was his moment finally
[1:49:11.640 --> 1:49:17.240]  to go public. That is so incredible. Just seeing that mass lie saying no one was there and showing
[1:49:17.240 --> 1:49:22.760]  when the gates first opened from a photo from the Washington Monument, it's that raping of the truth,
[1:49:22.760 --> 1:49:27.960]  isn't it? That got you to take action and got you to go from the career you were already going
[1:49:27.960 --> 1:49:33.000]  down doing this. It's changing your destiny. And there's so many other amazing Lucas's out there,
[1:49:33.000 --> 1:49:37.960]  men, women, black, white, Hispanic, old, young who love liberty. And you all need to do what he
[1:49:37.960 --> 1:49:43.480]  did because now he's reached tens of millions of people in just six months. So again, talk about
[1:49:43.480 --> 1:49:49.320]  your awakening because it's so important. Well, you're absolutely right. What you, what you set
[1:49:49.320 --> 1:49:53.080]  out. So there's just got to the point, because I wasn't really focusing with the eight years of
[1:49:53.080 --> 1:49:56.280]  Obama. You know, I, my mother would constantly tell me, you know, this is what's happening. This
[1:49:56.280 --> 1:50:00.680]  was going on. I was like, okay, okay. But the media, they were like, he's crapping rainbows.
[1:50:00.680 --> 1:50:04.760]  So I was like, okay, let's see what's going on. And then it was such a stark contrast when it
[1:50:04.760 --> 1:50:11.480]  got to Trump. And it was just this myriad of, of just, just falsehoods or just hyperbolic rhetoric.
[1:50:11.480 --> 1:50:17.240]  Everything from the inauguration to the, to the Mark Luther King bus, to just petty stuff,
[1:50:17.240 --> 1:50:20.440]  where he would say, you know, I have the best words. They would say, that's a lot.
[1:50:20.440 --> 1:50:23.880]  And they would get him, Trump, that's a way of talking very hyperbolic statements, you know,
[1:50:23.880 --> 1:50:29.000]  where we have the, we have the best men, we have the best people and don't constitute that as a lot.
[1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:33.960]  I'm just like, I've never seen an attack like this. And anyone, anyone who remotes, remotely
[1:50:33.960 --> 1:50:40.280]  tries to attend, defend this man, we saw with a Carter, how they're talking about, oh, well,
[1:50:40.280 --> 1:50:43.880]  he's looking for a position on the Trump administration. Jimmy Carter himself said,
[1:50:43.880 --> 1:50:47.480]  he'd never seen any, anything like this before. You've never seen an attack on a president like
[1:50:47.480 --> 1:50:51.240]  this before. But if you try and say something like that, especially within the black community,
[1:50:51.240 --> 1:50:57.400]  how they turn, they have turned black conservatives as if we're the enemy of black people. And I
[1:50:57.400 --> 1:51:02.840]  always would make a, a clear distinguishment in my videos between black people and black
[1:51:02.840 --> 1:51:07.480]  ignorance. How I define ignorance or is anyone, they come in all races. White people have
[1:51:07.480 --> 1:51:11.640]  an ignorance in their race with the Nazis or the, the, the, the, the Klan's men, the white
[1:51:11.640 --> 1:51:18.280]  supremacy, his Spanish with the MS-13. The thing is, is that it's overrepresented, we're overrated,
[1:51:18.280 --> 1:51:22.040]  overrepresented in the black community when it comes to ignorance. And they have this divide
[1:51:22.040 --> 1:51:27.000]  where if you support Trump, you're against black people. Well, that's what MTV and Hollywood,
[1:51:27.000 --> 1:51:32.200]  I've talked to top hip rappers, I mean, on, on record, you name it, that they said,
[1:51:32.200 --> 1:51:35.560]  they were told in the eighties and nineties, you're going to push gangster rap and you're
[1:51:35.560 --> 1:51:38.840]  going to do this or we're not going to play your stuff on MTV. They did that on purpose.
[1:51:38.840 --> 1:51:43.800]  They took the worst examples of the African-American community and force fed it by design.
[1:51:45.160 --> 1:51:49.400]  Exactly. It's a hundred percent. But do you look at it? But what are the, what's the narrative
[1:51:49.400 --> 1:51:53.320]  about? That's why I realized that optics is so important. When you have Michelle Obama talking
[1:51:53.320 --> 1:51:58.440]  about GOP as the, the, the party of old white men, the optics are so important and liberals know
[1:51:58.440 --> 1:52:05.560]  this. So you look into the issue of things, you know, like, huh, that's not as it seems to be.
[1:52:05.560 --> 1:52:09.640]  A Democrats want to talk about, you know, we, we love black and brown people, but
[1:52:09.640 --> 1:52:14.920]  that's interesting. When you look into, to plan parenthood, what is it that the more blacks were
[1:52:14.920 --> 1:52:21.960]  killed through abortion than born? We're, or plan parenthoods primarily in low-income black
[1:52:21.960 --> 1:52:26.760]  neighborhoods. We're, we're Margaret Singer. They want to hush, hush about Margaret Singer.
[1:52:26.760 --> 1:52:31.480]  She was a racist eugensis. But, but you have black people talking about, yeah, yeah, you know,
[1:52:31.480 --> 1:52:35.800]  uh, a plan parenthood, I say on plan parenthood. I'm like, do you not know the history? Do you
[1:52:35.800 --> 1:52:39.480]  not know the history of the Democratic Party? But they spun that with the liberal professors
[1:52:39.480 --> 1:52:43.480]  talking about, oh, the party switch. I'm just like, it's one thing after another. They hedge
[1:52:43.480 --> 1:52:47.240]  everything that they say. And when you look into it, they want to talk about education,
[1:52:47.240 --> 1:52:53.400]  the vouchers. They want, they, they try and hold blacks and everyone for that matter,
[1:52:53.400 --> 1:52:57.240]  anything that falls against her narrative. And white liberals, they're so in health,
[1:52:57.240 --> 1:52:59.640]  they're highly intelligent. I got to give it to them because everything
[1:52:59.640 --> 1:53:04.200]  they're super manipulators, that's the moment amazing Lucas should come to.
[1:53:05.000 --> 1:53:09.480]  When you realize, I think they were just misled idiots. No, at academic level and above,
[1:53:09.480 --> 1:53:13.560]  they know there's a game plan. They're following an exact script. And that was in the wiki leaks
[1:53:13.560 --> 1:53:17.400]  where they're talking about, we're losing control. What are we going to do? Let's have more culture
[1:53:17.400 --> 1:53:21.880]  war. And then they just ramped it up. But do you think it's back starting to backfire? I mean,
[1:53:21.880 --> 1:53:27.560]  because it's gotten so cartoonish that, that, that, that, that people aren't buying it, except the
[1:53:27.560 --> 1:53:33.160]  weak minded, they're going into a totally crazed mode. Like these Hollywood people saying killed,
[1:53:34.280 --> 1:53:40.680]  you know, conservatives, a kidnap Baron Trump, a burn down people's houses. That's the real problem
[1:53:40.680 --> 1:53:47.160]  is that certain minority of idiot white people, black people, Hispanics that are morons, they're
[1:53:47.160 --> 1:53:51.000]  really buying, like you said at the start, they really think they're fighting Hitler. They really
[1:53:51.000 --> 1:53:57.320]  think when the CIA director, former director says Trump's taking kids to Auschwitz, that they actually
[1:53:57.320 --> 1:54:04.600]  will hell, we better free him from Auschwitz. Exactly. Exactly. It's like, oh my goodness,
[1:54:04.600 --> 1:54:09.160]  you're hearing this. And I was like, you know what, if I actually believed just at just base value,
[1:54:09.160 --> 1:54:13.560]  what they were saying, I'd be right there with them. This is horrible. This is a travesty.
[1:54:13.560 --> 1:54:17.880]  But they've limited, they've dumbed down the American people. They've dumbed them down.
[1:54:17.880 --> 1:54:22.040]  You did your studies have shown this, that people are no longer critically thinking.
[1:54:22.040 --> 1:54:28.040]  They are so easily swayed by pleas of emotion, completely palatious arguments,
[1:54:28.040 --> 1:54:32.760]  but they're emotionally sound. Oh my gosh, oh, this sounds so horrible. And it's just like,
[1:54:32.760 --> 1:54:37.640]  no, none of that is backed up by facts. You know, when they want to talk about science,
[1:54:37.640 --> 1:54:42.280]  conservative state science, but they want to give woman of the year award to Caitlyn Jenner.
[1:54:42.280 --> 1:54:48.440]  Oh man, but you want to talk to me about climate change and the impact that we're having,
[1:54:48.440 --> 1:54:53.640]  but you believe peanut butter is a gender? Like, come on, at least be consistent.
[1:54:55.080 --> 1:54:59.720]  They're trying to make us accept whatever their latest PS is. That's really it. They're trying to,
[1:54:59.720 --> 1:55:06.840]  they're at war with reality. And the thing is that they have the people on the spotlight.
[1:55:06.840 --> 1:55:12.520]  Like you were saying, all of this hyperbolic, just defamatory, inflammatory nonsense,
[1:55:12.520 --> 1:55:17.000]  this dribble that's coming out. Well, it's gotten to the point that people who are on the left
[1:55:17.000 --> 1:55:21.320]  are now slowly inching over to the right. So now slowly inching over to the center.
[1:55:21.320 --> 1:55:24.680]  And they keep on saying, oh, we're winning. We're winning. And they don't understand
[1:55:24.680 --> 1:55:28.600]  that by doing this constantly, constantly saying the man is evil, 90% of the coverage
[1:55:28.600 --> 1:55:33.160]  is negative. Evil, evil, evil, that people understand, hey, not everything this man
[1:55:33.160 --> 1:55:39.640]  could possibly be doing by probability could be evil. So something, something's not right here.
[1:55:39.640 --> 1:55:44.360]  Let me, let me go and look this up. Huh? That's not true. Why are they saying this? And we're
[1:55:44.360 --> 1:55:49.720]  seeing this, it's, but at the same time, they're clever because they don't show that. The same
[1:55:49.720 --> 1:55:53.080]  thing what they did with the 2016 election. Oh, Hillary's gonna win it. Hillary's gonna win it.
[1:55:53.080 --> 1:55:57.320]  Every person they have in the spotlight, every person they show, yep, I think Hillary's gonna
[1:55:57.320 --> 1:55:59.480]  win it. And in Trump, he just needs to get out of the way.
[1:55:59.480 --> 1:56:03.800]  And it creates this perception that, that everybody agrees and that everybody's on the
[1:56:03.800 --> 1:56:08.360]  same page and that's not the case. But then when they lost the cognitive dissonance kicked in,
[1:56:08.360 --> 1:56:12.440]  they've doubled down. Now the economy's coming back and we get all these Democrats
[1:56:12.440 --> 1:56:17.560]  going on TV and saying what you and I already knew. I want the economy to implode. So these
[1:56:17.560 --> 1:56:22.680]  people are dependent on us. I wanted depression. I want the economy to crash. Bill Marr said,
[1:56:22.680 --> 1:56:26.360]  well, he's got a hundred million dollars. The average person's living paycheck to paycheck.
[1:56:26.360 --> 1:56:32.760]  How evil is that? And how disconnected are they? They're completely disconnected. And I think
[1:56:32.760 --> 1:56:37.160]  people see that, but I don't think they see that. And I don't think that's what's being
[1:56:37.160 --> 1:56:42.360]  portrayed. And the same thing I feel is going to happen come 2020. Because right now, God forbid,
[1:56:42.360 --> 1:56:46.920]  you say you're, you're a Trump supporter or you, or you even say anything favorable to Trump.
[1:56:46.920 --> 1:56:52.120]  People are like, Oh my God, you're a Nazi, you're a Hitler. And that's what's happening. So people
[1:56:52.120 --> 1:56:56.280]  are going to be a little silent. And they come 2020. That's when they're going to show it with the
[1:56:56.280 --> 1:57:02.120]  polls. And they're going to, it's the same. It's this, this feedback. There's a documentary on
[1:57:02.120 --> 1:57:06.360]  MTV, how they're saying, you know what, we, we show people what they think they want. The people
[1:57:06.360 --> 1:57:11.960]  see, Oh, that, that was perception management. But it only works from the weak minded, as you said.
[1:57:11.960 --> 1:57:16.200]  And just like they said in the New York Times, 99%, 98% chance Hillary will win.
[1:57:16.200 --> 1:57:19.960]  They had that on their front page for months. But a few hours later, when she started losing,
[1:57:19.960 --> 1:57:26.120]  then it went down. They said 55% chance Trump wins. I mean, it's just a made up crap number.
[1:57:26.120 --> 1:57:30.760]  It's amazing. And the amazing Lucas is here. We're going to come back. Go ahead. Amazing Lucas.
[1:57:30.760 --> 1:57:36.520]  Sorry. But did you notice response from the anchors out there? Oh, they're, they're dejected.
[1:57:37.160 --> 1:57:40.440]  They want to tell me that they're giving air and non-bias news.
[1:57:41.240 --> 1:57:45.000]  Like what? But I've been hiding it. These are the death throws. We'll talk about the death
[1:57:45.000 --> 1:57:50.040]  throws of the globalist next in full war's life is launching its newest product. We're really,

[1:59:44.760 --> 1:59:54.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:59:54.280 --> 2:00:22.760]  By the way, I was just talking to the amazing Lucas. He's going to be in studio with us next week.
[2:00:22.760 --> 2:00:28.600]  Amazing. I am so excited. So you seem to really have your finger on the pulse of this and I'm
[2:00:28.600 --> 2:00:31.720]  fascinated. We'll talk about some policies next segment and then you're going to go. Then I'm
[2:00:31.720 --> 2:00:35.560]  going to take calls and some of the other news issues in place of Trae Gowdy clips that are
[2:00:35.560 --> 2:00:38.280]  really powerful. I've been critical of him, but now he's starting to really wake up.
[2:00:39.240 --> 2:00:44.760]  But you're awakening. You're already awake because I've seen your show. I've seen your clips.
[2:00:44.760 --> 2:00:50.040]  I've read about your conservative Christian family, successful, understanding the American dream.
[2:00:50.040 --> 2:00:56.920]  But the fact that you saw late brazen lies that were so ridiculous, like it really freaked me out
[2:00:56.920 --> 2:01:01.000]  that I was in those giant crowds and watch hundreds of thousands turned away because they
[2:01:01.000 --> 2:01:06.280]  couldn't even fit in to the mall. And then to see all the news say no one was there. It was a failure
[2:01:06.280 --> 2:01:11.080]  that like that they would tell a lie that big no one they were going to be caught told me they'd
[2:01:11.080 --> 2:01:17.720]  gone from lying to crazy lying. And I, I think the establishment just can't give up. I think
[2:01:17.720 --> 2:01:22.120]  they're crazy. I think it's all boomeranging back on them right now. And the evidence shows that.
[2:01:22.120 --> 2:01:24.520]  So A, do you agree with that? And where does this go?
[2:01:26.520 --> 2:01:32.920]  Where's it go? That's a good question. That's a very good, amazing question. But you're absolutely
[2:01:32.920 --> 2:01:37.480]  right. But the thing is there, like I say, it goes back to a very intelligent about how they
[2:01:37.480 --> 2:01:43.000]  go about information. They mix, intermingle those big lies with little lies and the little
[2:01:43.000 --> 2:01:47.640]  lies with little half truths. And they play these games of semantics. Like I was looking at this
[2:01:47.640 --> 2:01:51.800]  notes report how they say that's false. That's false. And they play the games with semantics,
[2:01:51.800 --> 2:01:56.840]  interchange policy with law, and people don't catch that. And they take advantage that the fact
[2:01:56.840 --> 2:02:03.480]  that people have lives. So not everyone has time to go and research what MSNBC says is actually
[2:02:03.480 --> 2:02:07.080]  truthful. Not everyone has a time in their day because they have families, they have, you know,
[2:02:07.080 --> 2:02:11.720]  bills to pay to go and research what CNN says is truthful. So they're taking these people,
[2:02:11.720 --> 2:02:19.400]  these news outlets at the work. And they're taking advantage of people. That's what's happening.
[2:02:21.400 --> 2:02:27.480]  You're absolutely right. You know, the media made fun of Trump for weeks that he put up big photos
[2:02:27.480 --> 2:02:31.960]  where the press would come through the press room of the record crowd. And they said, oh,
[2:02:31.960 --> 2:02:36.040]  the insecure president keeps showing it. You know, he's really sad that no one showed up.
[2:02:36.040 --> 2:02:42.040]  No, Trump was fundamentally freaked out. Not in his ego about his crowd size that the media would
[2:02:42.040 --> 2:02:46.840]  lie like that. I mean, that should really a public event. It'd be like a sold out Super Bowl.
[2:02:46.840 --> 2:02:51.960]  And you show a photo five minutes after the doors open and nobody's there. You go, oh, look,
[2:02:51.960 --> 2:02:56.120]  nobody showed up the Super Bowl. It'd be like, what the hell is wrong with our media? We all
[2:02:56.120 --> 2:03:02.120]  saw it. It was full. But those those stories are suppressed, Alex. That's your thing. It's not about
[2:03:02.120 --> 2:03:06.440]  what you know. It's about what you can prove. And what you can prove isn't shown to the spotlight.
[2:03:06.440 --> 2:03:11.080]  Well, then you're crazy, man. That's what it is. If you have every news outlet saying this is a lie,
[2:03:11.080 --> 2:03:16.440]  this is a lie, this is a lie. And they change these lies and the truths through repetition.
[2:03:17.320 --> 2:03:21.960]  And it's like this brainwashing that's happened taking place in America. I'm out here in California.
[2:03:21.960 --> 2:03:28.440]  I heard a lady actually believe that Trump was a Nazi. I'm just like, I just had to take a moment.
[2:03:28.440 --> 2:03:34.360]  He's like Super Pro Israel. His daughter's married to an Orthodox Jew. He's always been Pro Israel.
[2:03:34.360 --> 2:03:39.240]  He's the guy that was the first guy that he's racist. I'm 44. I can't believe that 40 something
[2:03:39.240 --> 2:03:43.640]  years ago, there was still golf clubs that didn't let blacks and Jews in. Trump's the guy that bought
[2:03:43.640 --> 2:03:49.560]  all those and opened it up. Mar-Lago did not let blacks and Jews in. He did that. I mean, it's like
[2:03:49.560 --> 2:04:00.440]  it's crazy. Island award as well. Sorry. Did he get an Ellis Island award as well? Absolutely. Yeah.
[2:04:01.800 --> 2:04:05.640]  But you'll never hear any of this. You'll never hear anything. So you see how quickly they turn
[2:04:05.640 --> 2:04:10.680]  to Kanye West. They stick to the narrative. That's the thing. If you fall out of that line,
[2:04:10.680 --> 2:04:14.520]  well, you've got to get yourself back in line. And the thing is, Trump gets your cancer and
[2:04:14.520 --> 2:04:19.080]  they blame him for ruining chemotherapy. They all, he ruined the economy.
[2:04:21.560 --> 2:04:24.840]  You know, let me ask this one to come back and get into other issues and play some clips here,
[2:04:24.840 --> 2:04:29.640]  but the amazing thing is when we come back, let me ask you this. What happens if they are able
[2:04:29.640 --> 2:04:35.400]  to assassinate him? God forbid, but that's what they want. And what happens if they do get the
[2:04:35.400 --> 2:04:41.800]  economy to crash? Don't they think they'll get the blame when they're all over the place trying
[2:04:41.800 --> 2:04:45.320]  to crash the economy? Because we're all neck and neck with these folks. Don't just think
[2:04:45.320 --> 2:04:49.000]  because we're winning now, we're going to win this whole thing. Yeah, half times here, we're like,
[2:04:49.000 --> 2:04:52.840]  you know, seven points ahead. But that doesn't mean Jack did least squad. We don't keep our
[2:04:52.840 --> 2:04:58.360]  head in the game. We'll be right back with the amazing Lucas. Nourish a probiotic friendly

[2:05:55.080 --> 2:06:12.600]  Waging War on Corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[2:06:14.440 --> 2:06:19.720]  You know, every time Donald Trump Jr. or Trump tweets it in FullWars.com article,
[2:06:19.720 --> 2:06:24.120]  it becomes a major news cycle for two or three days because the left is all about gatekeeping and
[2:06:24.120 --> 2:06:28.280]  then they'll lie about what I've said and lie about what I've done. They used to call me a racist,
[2:06:28.280 --> 2:06:34.440]  but nobody bought that, so they moved on to other made-up stuff. But Donald Trump Jr. tweeted out
[2:06:34.440 --> 2:06:39.160]  our story today from infowars.com. It was Paul Watson that first discovered that
[2:06:39.800 --> 2:06:48.600]  Peter Fonda was running around engaging in all those activities and saying that we need to
[2:06:48.600 --> 2:06:55.880]  kidnap Barron Trump and we need to put him in a cell with a pedophile, put him in a cage,
[2:06:55.880 --> 2:07:00.760]  and we need to go after the board patrol people's children and scare them. We need to
[2:07:00.760 --> 2:07:07.080]  hack their databases and dox them and all this other crazy stuff. And again, that's what it's
[2:07:07.080 --> 2:07:12.040]  all about. We shouldn't be letting them decide who we have on or who we talk to or what we do.
[2:07:12.040 --> 2:07:20.040]  I mean, I'll just tell you point blank that some of the same folks you've seen on national TV
[2:07:20.040 --> 2:07:23.640]  promoting Trump that became big controversies that were just mentioned a few minutes ago,
[2:07:23.640 --> 2:07:29.560]  they wanted to come here today. And then the security and the record companies,
[2:07:29.560 --> 2:07:33.080]  everybody are like, well, let's wait on that. Let's not do that. Again, you don't want us to
[2:07:33.080 --> 2:07:37.320]  Baker act you again, do you? That's the level of behind the scenes I'm dealing with. I'm going to
[2:07:37.320 --> 2:07:42.280]  just leave it at that. But that's the level I'm dealing with to just try to get a guest wants
[2:07:42.280 --> 2:07:48.440]  to come on and they say, listen, get down, girl, get down, get down, girl, get down,
[2:07:48.440 --> 2:07:53.160]  you're not going to show will lock your ass up. And it's not like I'm even over here trying to get
[2:07:53.160 --> 2:07:58.040]  this person on. And then it's about that close to happening. And let me tell you, all hell breaks
[2:07:58.040 --> 2:08:01.880]  loose, because Hollywood wants to run all these artists and control all these people. And it's
[2:08:01.880 --> 2:08:06.840]  coming to an end. Because most of these rappers, even people that have put Trump down have stated
[2:08:06.840 --> 2:08:10.600]  his house. And they know the truth about Trump. And they know it's a load of crap. And they know
[2:08:10.600 --> 2:08:15.160]  what we just talked about. He was the first guy. I'm 44. I've found that these people are racism
[2:08:15.160 --> 2:08:19.480]  in this country. When Trump first started getting live courses 40 something years ago, right around
[2:08:19.480 --> 2:08:24.680]  the time I was born, the early 70s, he was the guy that bought Marlago and all these places
[2:08:24.680 --> 2:08:29.720]  that were local clubs owned by the local elites, who they would not let Jews or blacks in.
[2:08:30.520 --> 2:08:35.240]  Trump's the guy that bought more than 20 racist courses that of course were in decline and fallen
[2:08:35.240 --> 2:08:40.680]  apart. They were super nice. But you know, the old crazy people were dying off. And he's the guy
[2:08:40.680 --> 2:08:45.160]  that brought the black people into the fancy golf courses. And that's why he was in all the rap
[2:08:45.160 --> 2:08:49.080]  songs and love all the black folks, because they all knew Donald Trump was a cool guy. And then
[2:08:49.080 --> 2:08:54.680]  they turn it around that he's this big racist. But the truth is Kanye West knows it's not true.
[2:08:54.680 --> 2:08:58.680]  Lewis Farrakhan say what you want. I disagree with what he says. He knows Trump's not racist.
[2:08:58.680 --> 2:09:02.360]  All the rest of this stuff, because it's it's it's that's not what's happening. This is the
[2:09:02.360 --> 2:09:07.400]  reality. I'm ranting. The amazing Lucas is on with us. There's so much going on. What do you
[2:09:07.400 --> 2:09:14.680]  want to hit next, my friend? Man, what can't we cover? You know, everything from the legal
[2:09:15.400 --> 2:09:21.080]  legal immigration that's going on, the narrative they have there to collusion. We saw how collusion
[2:09:21.080 --> 2:09:27.480]  took a backseat. We saw that that went real hush hush. And we saw the spin they did on the Kim
[2:09:27.480 --> 2:09:33.400]  John oon summit. I'm like, how do you see that as him validating or justifying Kim John oon?
[2:09:34.360 --> 2:09:39.400]  It's just like we went from that and then to zero tolerance policy. Oh, he's breaking up families,
[2:09:39.400 --> 2:09:43.480]  breaking up families. He knows how every outlet is saying Trump is separation of families,
[2:09:43.480 --> 2:09:47.560]  separation of families. I'm like, zero tolerance policy said nothing about that. There's nothing
[2:09:47.560 --> 2:09:53.080]  that states mandatory separation of families in the policy that the zero tolerance policy has.
[2:09:53.080 --> 2:09:57.800]  But yet it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter because that's the narrative that they're going with.
[2:09:59.160 --> 2:10:03.640]  And it's so clear the Democrats even admit they've dropped the collusion story because that's all
[2:10:03.640 --> 2:10:12.840]  been proven to be a fraud beyond Watergate. And they've now moved on completely amazing Lucas
[2:10:12.840 --> 2:10:17.320]  to this made up border thing. And it's just not working. What do you predict they're going to do
[2:10:17.320 --> 2:10:25.720]  next? Whatever happens with the policy that Trump allegedly is going to be signing to end
[2:10:25.720 --> 2:10:29.880]  separation of families and all that. You want to know who's going to be credit for that? Not Trump,
[2:10:29.880 --> 2:10:34.840]  the Democrats. Like, thank God, thank God the Democrats stopped this evil man. Thank God,
[2:10:34.840 --> 2:10:39.320]  we have to resist. They were in control of Congress when that law got passed. So now
[2:10:39.320 --> 2:10:43.400]  they're going to take credit for Trump getting rid of their law. Of course they are. It's
[2:10:43.400 --> 2:10:48.760]  absolutely genius. And who's to call them out? You think CNN's going to call them out? See,
[2:10:48.760 --> 2:10:52.840]  we have Don Lemon calling the president a racist. Imagine that.
[2:10:57.160 --> 2:11:01.960]  You know, I'm not normally speechless, but I mean, it really is starting to get completely and
[2:11:01.960 --> 2:11:07.960]  totally insane. Amazing Lucas. What is that robot sound? I love that. Nobody else has got that on
[2:11:07.960 --> 2:11:13.560]  there. It's like a pair of fire missiles. Are you sitting on drop a missile base or something? I hope
[2:11:13.560 --> 2:11:20.200]  not. But you never know nowadays. I think someone's car is being towed. Oh, that's what I'm hearing.
[2:11:21.160 --> 2:11:25.880]  Seriously, though, you're out in LA. Do you share your thoughts openly? Your videos have
[2:11:25.880 --> 2:11:29.080]  millions of views. I mean, right out of the gates, you're very successful. People want to hear what
[2:11:29.080 --> 2:11:34.600]  you have to say. Obviously, you're a smart, good looking guy. Have you got any haters on the street
[2:11:34.600 --> 2:11:39.960]  or what have a lot of you gotten? Well, the thing is, the beautiful thing about being this,
[2:11:39.960 --> 2:11:45.080]  the skin color, they're not very likely to call me a white supremacist. They're not likely to say
[2:11:45.080 --> 2:11:52.280]  that, you know, I am a white privilege. So I won't go out and, you know, say Trump,
[2:11:52.280 --> 2:11:57.800]  awesome, Trump, awesome, Trump, but I'll wear like a MAGA hat, just to spark conversation.
[2:11:57.800 --> 2:12:01.240]  You know, I'll wear, you know, build the wall shirt, just to spark conversation.
[2:12:01.240 --> 2:12:06.520]  And I get that, that invites people to talk to you. It's like, hey, are you a Trump supporter?
[2:12:06.520 --> 2:12:11.000]  It's like, yeah, don't you know he's a racist? What, what racist things have he, has he done?
[2:12:11.000 --> 2:12:17.640]  Well, you know, and you get this Socratic method where you have to have them explain what they
[2:12:17.640 --> 2:12:23.320]  believe and do that process. They come to the realization that either A, what they believe is
[2:12:23.320 --> 2:12:28.440]  completely false and they're going to accept the truth or B, that they're going to hold on to the
[2:12:28.440 --> 2:12:35.000]  lies and the confirmation bias that they have and walk away. And that's usually how interactions go.
[2:12:35.000 --> 2:12:38.680]  They're like, oh, you have a point or no, you're not to buy.
[2:12:41.400 --> 2:12:45.800]  You know, I've got stacks of news here in front of me, but the last thing I want to get into you
[2:12:45.800 --> 2:12:51.880]  with is the EU votes yes on meme ban censorship machines where there's an interface we all go
[2:12:51.880 --> 2:12:57.000]  through to browse or get on the web. It's even going to control people on message boards. Soros
[2:12:57.000 --> 2:13:01.720]  literally runs it. It sounds like I'm in like a comic book or something. This is so ridiculous.
[2:13:01.720 --> 2:13:07.080]  And a link tax that now got passed out of the EU committee and they're trying to pass the whole
[2:13:07.080 --> 2:13:13.560]  thing. I mean, this has got to be a wake up call for people that they know we're intellectually
[2:13:13.560 --> 2:13:17.720]  winning. So they're openly just like the colleges trying to censor everything. I don't see them
[2:13:17.720 --> 2:13:23.400]  winning this battle. What's your view? I don't see them winning at all. But they will win it
[2:13:23.400 --> 2:13:28.920]  if people don't stand up and say something. That's that's the main thing. If you don't stand up and
[2:13:28.920 --> 2:13:35.160]  correct someone when you hear them spouting out lies or falsehoods, it is your job as an American
[2:13:35.160 --> 2:13:39.800]  to correct these falsehoods to correct the fake news that's being propagated and spread throughout
[2:13:39.800 --> 2:13:44.920]  social media, Google or or or or or or television, wherever it is, wherever you hear it, you have
[2:13:44.920 --> 2:13:49.720]  to correct it because once you once you correct one person, well, guess what? That has a rippling
[2:13:49.720 --> 2:13:54.280]  effect in the community and that person corrects another person and the truth gets out. But you
[2:13:54.280 --> 2:13:58.840]  have to take a stance. You have to fight. I know many people aren't, you know, don't like public
[2:13:58.840 --> 2:14:03.880]  speaking. They don't like confrontation. But at the end of the day, you can either be silenced
[2:14:04.760 --> 2:14:10.360]  or you can speak out and fight for your freedom. And that's what it boils down to. That's what
[2:14:10.360 --> 2:14:14.760]  many people are going to have to decide whether they choose to speak up. And I'm not saying speak
[2:14:14.760 --> 2:14:19.400]  up at work or something and get yourself fired or have an argument with the teacher or something
[2:14:19.400 --> 2:14:23.640]  like that, because people on power, when they can dictate your grades, if they don't like what
[2:14:23.640 --> 2:14:27.240]  you're saying, guess what? You'll get a B or you'll get a C or you'll get an F because, hey,
[2:14:27.240 --> 2:14:31.880]  I don't agree with you. So be wise about it, be intelligent about it, just like the liberals
[2:14:31.880 --> 2:14:37.560]  are doing. But at the same time, you have to speak out because this fight is only going to get,
[2:14:37.560 --> 2:14:42.680]  it's only going to get worse out in 2020. I hope everyone realizes this. This is the easiest it's
[2:14:42.680 --> 2:14:46.840]  going to get because come 2020, because you saw that Hillary lost election, what did they do?
[2:14:46.840 --> 2:14:51.640]  Russia pollution, where they say blame it on Facebook. Why do you think that is? They have
[2:14:51.640 --> 2:14:56.360]  Facebook, they have, you know, Instagram, they have Twitter. What do you think that's going to
[2:14:56.360 --> 2:15:00.440]  be used? You think that's not to be weaponized? You think that's not to be weaponized like the
[2:15:00.440 --> 2:15:06.920]  IRS when Obama said absolutely not that didn't happen. Turns out it actually did happen. And
[2:15:06.920 --> 2:15:11.640]  people when you understand out of everything the word learning right now, imagine if Hillary Clinton
[2:15:11.640 --> 2:15:16.440]  won't imagine that and you know damn well, that's what they were betting on. Mom would have been
[2:15:16.440 --> 2:15:20.200]  the war. Oh, they're still, they're still going along with her whole game plan, even though she
[2:15:20.200 --> 2:15:25.640]  didn't get in. I hope she goes to Hillary 2020. That's why I've been trolling. I'd be like,
[2:15:25.640 --> 2:15:31.960]  Hillary, please let her run again. But you hear this, they're trying to keep people like, please,
[2:15:31.960 --> 2:15:36.840]  Hillary, shut up, please be quiet. Exactly. All right. Well, listen, the amazing Lucas,
[2:15:36.840 --> 2:15:40.520]  where he gets you that ticket, you're coming in studio next week. I really appreciate it. Love

[2:20:25.480 --> 2:20:43.480]  You know, it gives me a lot of hope having people on like the amazing Lucas we just had on.
[2:20:44.280 --> 2:20:49.320]  And you know, Trey Gowdy has really whitewash a lot of stuff for the FBI and the Justice Department.
[2:20:49.320 --> 2:20:53.080]  We don't have to grovel the FBI and the Justice Department and say how great they are.
[2:20:53.080 --> 2:20:58.440]  Every time we criticize something that some bad person did what you say is in history,
[2:20:58.440 --> 2:21:01.240]  you're always going to get corrupt bad people in any institution.
[2:21:02.120 --> 2:21:06.200]  And we need to target them when they're corrupt and when they do bad things and go after them
[2:21:06.200 --> 2:21:12.680]  and not think, Oh, that impunes the institution. No, people respect institutions that go after
[2:21:12.680 --> 2:21:19.560]  bad people and tear them into pieces. You know, the globalists are laughter like Jones used to
[2:21:19.560 --> 2:21:24.840]  not trust the government. Jones used to be anti government. Joe left us walk over the
[2:21:24.840 --> 2:21:29.400]  more sophisticated ones and they go, I remember when you used to not trust the government,
[2:21:29.400 --> 2:21:32.920]  you used to actually stand for something good. They always attacked me before,
[2:21:33.800 --> 2:21:40.200]  but now you just grovel to the power structure and you just grovel to Trump and you just,
[2:21:40.200 --> 2:21:43.880]  yeah, because we're not going to have 300% tariffs against us anymore.
[2:21:43.880 --> 2:21:50.920]  He's like saying you got to cut your tariff in half to 150. That's what he did with China
[2:21:51.800 --> 2:21:56.600]  on all their manipulations. He's like, okay, you got a $900 billion deficit with us.
[2:22:02.600 --> 2:22:04.120]  Stop it or I'm going to do 50 billion.
[2:22:09.480 --> 2:22:12.600]  And then that didn't do anything. He goes, okay, 200 billion.
[2:22:12.600 --> 2:22:19.960]  I'm telling you, knock it off. We're still 600 plus billion dollars behind them,
[2:22:19.960 --> 2:22:21.240]  even if he does this new thing.
[2:22:23.960 --> 2:22:35.400]  Canada, and I love Canada has a 270% tax on everything dairy, cheese, milk, cream, yogurt,
[2:22:35.400 --> 2:22:41.800]  butter. What do you think that does to Wisconsin?
[2:22:45.080 --> 2:22:49.640]  By the way, I'm not a snob. I buy Canadian jam and Canadian stuff that, you know,
[2:22:49.640 --> 2:22:53.880]  and I did go to Whole Foods for Bezos on it. I mean, I like buying French this or German that.
[2:22:53.880 --> 2:23:02.120]  I want to see what it's like. I like global trade, but man, Germany don't have a 50% tariff on all of
[2:23:02.120 --> 2:23:10.040]  our produce and then pull all sorts of inspection crap. I want to get to gaudy. It's just, you know,
[2:23:11.480 --> 2:23:17.400]  I'm a numbers guy. I actually live this stuff. I live looking at hundreds of articles and video
[2:23:17.400 --> 2:23:23.880]  clips a day. I know what's going on. And Trump is very pragmatically knowing this big corrupt
[2:23:23.880 --> 2:23:31.000]  system is the system. So he's doing very small little fixes just to get the ball rolling to test.
[2:23:31.000 --> 2:23:35.720]  And then little things are helping us. We're like a starving man or starving woman that hadn't had
[2:23:35.720 --> 2:23:39.800]  any food in a week and hadn't had water in a couple of days. And he's just, here's a little water.
[2:23:39.800 --> 2:23:43.880]  Here's a little biscuit. Oh, look, you're doing better. Here, let's give you a little piece of beef.
[2:23:44.600 --> 2:23:46.280]  And the media is like, give it nothing.
[2:23:51.960 --> 2:23:56.360]  And he's like, oh, you don't like the 50 billion? How about 200 billion? And China's so arrogant.
[2:23:56.360 --> 2:24:01.000]  I saw a CNN article this morning. I meant to, I got busy. I didn't send it to you.
[2:24:01.000 --> 2:24:06.840]  I just got to go to CNN. It's something like China cuts investments in the U S 90%.
[2:24:07.720 --> 2:24:12.280]  Now, see, I knew China's investment numbers because I follow that before I read it. And I went,
[2:24:12.280 --> 2:24:17.880]  wait a minute. And it's a peak. It was like $15 billion four years ago.
[2:24:19.320 --> 2:24:25.000]  China is the most one sided in the world. We make 600 billion in actual trade deficit.
[2:24:25.000 --> 2:24:30.120]  I know the 300 billion intellectual property conservatively. And then our companies make
[2:24:30.120 --> 2:24:34.040]  over a hundred billion investment a year in, in moving to China.
[2:24:35.880 --> 2:24:43.080]  And then China goes, we're mad at Trump. We've cut from 15 billion to three billion
[2:24:43.080 --> 2:24:48.920]  since he got in a year. What the frickin do? There it is. Chinese investment in the United
[2:24:48.920 --> 2:24:55.720]  States has plummeted 92%. Oh, Trump artists, everything negative. Go ahead and scroll down.
[2:24:57.880 --> 2:25:01.880]  The story is as fake as Rachel Maddow's tears. Remember when Obama couldn't even squeeze
[2:25:01.880 --> 2:25:05.240]  a tear out? So he was like touching the corner of his eye and he scrolled down. There's a graph on
[2:25:05.240 --> 2:25:12.040]  there. And then look, if you actually look at what was real investment, I dug deeper,
[2:25:12.680 --> 2:25:16.280]  I said 15, but they say 26. But if you actually look, it was actually 15 because that was actually
[2:25:16.280 --> 2:25:22.360]  in US companies over there. So let's just take their numbers, 26 billion. And now it's two billion.
[2:25:23.800 --> 2:25:27.000]  And that's what I'm saying. It's a drop in the bucket. It means nothing.
[2:25:27.800 --> 2:25:33.080]  China doesn't invest. That headline should be China doesn't invest in the United States.
[2:25:34.040 --> 2:25:38.040]  But instead of spending a dime in the US, they now spend a penny
[2:25:38.040 --> 2:25:49.160]  or 90% less. That's the real headline. They're gang raping us. China is a military action to shut
[2:25:49.160 --> 2:25:54.200]  us down to destroy us. Let's go out to break with some of Trey Gowdy. This is what all the
[2:25:54.200 --> 2:25:59.080]  belly aching and lying about kids and concentration camps is about. So you don't hear this.
[2:26:00.040 --> 2:26:04.920]  Now we're FBI agents and attorneys who decided to prejudge the outcome of the Hillary Clinton case
[2:26:04.920 --> 2:26:10.680]  before the investigation ended. I want you to let that sink in for a second. They prejudged the outcome
[2:26:10.680 --> 2:26:16.760]  of the Hillary Clinton investigation before the investigation ended. And these exact same FBI agents
[2:26:16.760 --> 2:26:21.800]  and attorneys prejudged the outcome of the Russian investigation before it even began.
[2:26:23.080 --> 2:26:28.280]  If prejudging the outcome of an investigation before it ends and prejudging the outcome of an
[2:26:28.280 --> 2:26:34.760]  investigation before it begins is not evidence of outcome determinative bias for the life of me.
[2:26:34.760 --> 2:26:42.120]  I don't know what would be. That is textbook bias. It is quite literally the definition of bias,
[2:26:43.080 --> 2:26:47.720]  allowing something other than the facts to determine your decision. These agents were
[2:26:47.720 --> 2:26:51.960]  calling her president before she was even interviewed. They were calling for the end of
[2:26:51.960 --> 2:26:57.880]  the Trump campaign before the investigation even began. They were calling for impeachment simply
[2:26:57.880 --> 2:27:05.320]  because he happened to be elected. That is bias. And with all due respect, this is the FBI's job,
[2:27:05.320 --> 2:27:09.320]  not mine. Hit pause again. We're going to play more of this. This is powerful.
[2:27:10.680 --> 2:27:16.760]  It's beyond bias. It's organized crime, a racketeering operation to defeat a candidate,
[2:27:16.760 --> 2:27:23.000]  then to defeat an elected candidate, president-elect to stop the votes of America. It is a
[2:27:23.000 --> 2:27:28.280]  giant civil rights violation that makes what the toothless KKK did in the South look like small
[2:27:28.280 --> 2:27:35.560]  change. You dropped the shark, bitches. And now it blew up in your new world order faces.
[2:27:36.840 --> 2:27:41.000]  And now even Gowdy can't toadie for you anymore. Let's finish up with toadie.
[2:27:41.560 --> 2:27:49.960]  Be harmless because I don't agree. I think bias is always harmful. So we'll spend a day on a small
[2:27:49.960 --> 2:27:55.960]  and number of a significant and leadership group of DOJ and FBI officials, officials who had leadership
[2:27:55.960 --> 2:28:02.440]  and supervisory roles in the Clinton and Russia investigations and who failed to meet the basic
[2:28:02.440 --> 2:28:10.040]  expectations of fundamental fairness. But there are tens of thousands of FBI agents and DOJ employees
[2:28:10.040 --> 2:28:15.400]  who do meet our exacting expectations. We will not be calling their names today, unfortunately,
[2:28:15.400 --> 2:28:19.800]  because we don't see why. Back up to the beginning. I'm going to play it when you come back and give
[2:28:19.800 --> 2:28:27.640]  the number up. I'm not in an FBI butt kissing brigade, but it's true. What Gowdy is saying here,
[2:28:27.640 --> 2:28:32.120]  I'll probably come back, is it was actually FBI whistleblowers, is why we know about a lot of this.
[2:28:33.880 --> 2:28:36.520]  And then that's who he's alluding to there. So there are good people there.
[2:28:37.080 --> 2:28:40.680]  And but the Clintons and the globalists have been putting their people in leadership
[2:28:40.680 --> 2:28:46.440]  for decades, folks. We have to admit it. We have to get these people out of there.
[2:28:47.000 --> 2:28:51.480]  Why is Strock still there? Lock his ass up. We'll be back.

[2:33:16.040 --> 2:33:22.200]  Biblical. What he means is Old Testament. Yes. Real wrath of God type stuff. Fire and brimstone
[2:33:22.200 --> 2:33:26.280]  coming down from the skies, rivers and seas boiling. 40 years of darkness, earthquakes,
[2:33:26.280 --> 2:33:31.480]  volcanoes. The big rising from the grave. Human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together,
[2:33:31.480 --> 2:33:46.040]  mass hysteria. I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man. Thomas Jefferson.
[2:33:46.040 --> 2:34:02.120]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[2:34:02.120 --> 2:34:07.800]  You know, this will be a big news item that Donald Trump Jr. dare tweet an infowars.com link of
[2:34:07.800 --> 2:34:16.680]  Peter Fonda. He's not a pedophile himself. He just called for Aaron Trump to be kidnapped,
[2:34:16.680 --> 2:34:22.280]  the president's son, Melania Trump's son, and to be held in a cage with a pedophile and for the
[2:34:22.280 --> 2:34:27.880]  names of border patrol agents, children to be hacked and customs border patrol to be hacked and
[2:34:27.880 --> 2:34:32.840]  be given out of the public. And guess what? Antifa's already done it and is sending out their names and
[2:34:32.840 --> 2:34:42.440]  where they live and saying attack them. But do you know the news? I'm betting money. There'll
[2:34:42.440 --> 2:34:45.800]  be a bunch of news articles if they're not already out. Maybe type in Alex Jones and click
[2:34:45.800 --> 2:34:51.400]  Google news. I bet George Soros' group is already in just a few hours already saying,
[2:34:51.400 --> 2:34:59.080]  how dare you? We tell you what you link to. Have they done it? No, they haven't done it.
[2:34:59.080 --> 2:35:05.160]  Here go back to the top. There's just hundreds of articles a day. Oh, look, but Peter Strock
[2:35:05.160 --> 2:35:11.480]  escorted from the FBI building. Look at that arrogant guy that ran the Hillary cover up,
[2:35:11.480 --> 2:35:16.760]  ran it all. Peter Strock.
[2:35:16.760 --> 2:35:28.760]  It's amazing, escorted from the FBI building. Is he about to get fired?
[2:35:30.760 --> 2:35:33.240]  That's the bare minimum. That guy needs to go to prison.
[2:35:35.720 --> 2:35:39.400]  I keep mentioning it. So let's just play. There's an eight minute statement by Gowdy
[2:35:39.400 --> 2:35:43.240]  that's very powerful, but this is just the last three minutes of it. So let's back up where we
[2:35:43.240 --> 2:35:48.440]  were and let's go ahead and play Gowdy. And again, he's kind of like Canary in the coal mine.
[2:35:48.440 --> 2:35:53.480]  Now that he is finally a former federal prosecutor admitting that you got a big
[2:35:53.480 --> 2:35:57.560]  group of bad people at the top. It's a small group, but it's still a large group that would
[2:35:57.560 --> 2:36:04.920]  engage in this. I mean, this is reckless. This is crazy. I mean, if you're going to frame somebody,
[2:36:04.920 --> 2:36:09.080]  that's bad enough. You're going to send text messages about to everybody. You're going to
[2:36:09.080 --> 2:36:13.640]  take money from Hillary, half a million. You're going to pay your wives that are running the
[2:36:13.640 --> 2:36:20.600]  fusion GPS to make it up millions of dollars. I mean, these guys were all the video, the full
[2:36:20.600 --> 2:36:24.280]  videos on news wars.com. You need to get it out to everybody because the news is just playing
[2:36:24.280 --> 2:36:29.800]  like 20 second clips. I've got his full eight minute statement on it and you need to see it.
[2:36:29.800 --> 2:36:34.680]  It's all solid gold. But speaking of that, let's go ahead and just go to it. Here it is.
[2:36:34.680 --> 2:36:40.360]  There were FBI agents and attorneys who decided to prejudge the outcome of the Hillary Clinton case
[2:36:40.360 --> 2:36:46.120]  before the investigation ended. I want you to let that sink in for a second. They prejudged the outcome
[2:36:46.120 --> 2:36:51.800]  of the Hillary Clinton investigation before the investigation ended. And these exact same FBI
[2:36:51.800 --> 2:36:57.240]  agents and attorneys prejudged the outcome of the Russian investigation before it even began.
[2:36:58.520 --> 2:37:03.480]  In prejudging the outcome of the investigation before it ends and prejudging the outcome
[2:37:03.480 --> 2:37:09.400]  of an investigation before it begins is not evidence of outcome determinative bias for the
[2:37:09.400 --> 2:37:14.040]  life of me. I don't know what would be. Let's hit pause. That is back at the beginning. I'm going to
[2:37:14.040 --> 2:37:20.600]  play it from the start. Plus, if you start going out and just deciding who's guilty without evidence,
[2:37:20.600 --> 2:37:25.080]  you're going to get burned when it comes out that they were innocent. It's all just crazy.
[2:37:25.640 --> 2:37:28.120]  Even if you were a sociopath, you wouldn't want to operate like this.
[2:37:28.120 --> 2:37:34.600]  But these leftists just think competence means nothing. They can just get away with anything.
[2:37:34.600 --> 2:37:40.280]  You can't do that. You can't smoke three packs of cigarettes a day and then wonder why you get lung
[2:37:40.280 --> 2:37:44.920]  cancer when you're 55. You can't drink a bottle of vodka every day and wonder why you get liver
[2:37:44.920 --> 2:37:49.640]  cancer or your liver fails. You can't go out in the middle of, you know, a bad neighborhood and
[2:37:49.640 --> 2:37:55.240]  start fights with the biggest guy and wonder why you get your teeth knocked out. But you people
[2:37:55.240 --> 2:38:01.000]  don't seem to get that. You think you're just going to say, kidnap the president's son in
[2:38:01.000 --> 2:38:05.000]  raping and then we're all going to crap our drawers and go away or you're going to threaten me and
[2:38:05.000 --> 2:38:09.640]  my family and I'm just going to go away? You don't know who you're dealing with, idiots.
[2:38:10.520 --> 2:38:14.680]  We've been busy leading our own lives and then you keep messing with us. You're going to make
[2:38:14.680 --> 2:38:19.080]  us come down on you just like the amazing Lucas I had on earlier. That guy's a successful one.
[2:38:19.080 --> 2:38:23.720]  National Bodybuilding Championships. It works at big video game companies. He's very successful.
[2:38:23.720 --> 2:38:29.400]  He doesn't want to get political. He has to. Junior people at those video game companies
[2:38:29.400 --> 2:38:35.480]  make 300,000 a year. He didn't want to become political, but he, you know, he's watching the
[2:38:35.480 --> 2:38:39.560]  news and they're saying no one's at the inauguration and then he goes and looks up raw video and it's
[2:38:39.560 --> 2:38:48.280]  full and he goes, that's crazy. And it is crazy. And people say, why are you obsessed on that?
[2:38:48.280 --> 2:38:52.120]  Because if they'll tell you nobody's at an inauguration and show you video before they
[2:38:52.120 --> 2:38:57.320]  let the crowds in and try to get away with that, it shows you they're not just liars. They're crazy.
[2:38:59.880 --> 2:39:03.320]  Because it's one thing that people lie sometimes and I don't defend that, but
[2:39:03.880 --> 2:39:07.240]  at least it's well thought out. You're like, well, that's bad. You're lying, but at least you're not
[2:39:07.240 --> 2:39:12.840]  a loon. You don't walk out at high noon in Texas and point at the sky and it's pure blue with a
[2:39:12.840 --> 2:39:18.200]  big old yellow sun and go, that, that's a black sky. And I'm like, no man, that ain't a black sky.
[2:39:18.200 --> 2:39:22.600]  And your guy is Alex. I'm like, I'm about to knock you upside your head. Get out of my face.
[2:39:23.240 --> 2:39:27.160]  There's a difference. I can't get them out of my face. They want to run my kids.
[2:39:27.160 --> 2:39:31.160]  They want to run my life. They want to tell me that there aren't two genders. They want to,
[2:39:31.160 --> 2:39:36.120]  I'm not doing it. They are just trying to get all their followers in line to follow whatever
[2:39:36.120 --> 2:39:42.120]  weird crap they make up. And here's the newsflash. I'm not doing it. Look, here's, I'm going to
[2:39:42.120 --> 2:39:48.360]  play the gowdy now. Play the gowdy now. Here it is. Were FBI agents and attorneys who decided to
[2:39:48.360 --> 2:39:53.080]  prejudge the outcome of the Hillary Clinton case before the investigation ended? I want you to
[2:39:53.080 --> 2:39:58.040]  let that sink in for a second. They prejudged the outcome of the Hillary Clinton investigation
[2:39:58.040 --> 2:40:05.160]  before the investigation ended. And these exact same FBI agents and attorneys prejudged the outcome
[2:40:05.160 --> 2:40:11.320]  of the Russian investigation before it even began. If prejudging the outcome of the investigation
[2:40:11.320 --> 2:40:17.320]  before it ends and prejudging the outcome of an investigation before it begins, is not evidence
[2:40:17.320 --> 2:40:24.440]  of outcome-determinative bias for the life of me. I don't know what would be. That is textbook bias.
[2:40:24.440 --> 2:40:29.400]  It's textbook frame up. It is quite literally the definition of bias. No, a frame up. Allowing
[2:40:29.400 --> 2:40:34.520]  something other than the facts to determine your decision. These agents were calling her president
[2:40:34.520 --> 2:40:39.240]  before she was even interviewed. They were calling for the end of the Trump campaign before the
[2:40:39.240 --> 2:40:44.920]  investigation even began. They were calling for impeachment simply because he happened to be
[2:40:44.920 --> 2:40:53.000]  elected. That is bias. And with all due respect is the FBI's job, not mine, to prove that bias can
[2:40:53.000 --> 2:41:01.080]  ever be harmless. Because I don't agree. I think bias is always harmful. So we'll spend a day on
[2:41:01.080 --> 2:41:06.840]  a small in number, but significant in leadership group of DOJ and FBI officials, officials who
[2:41:06.840 --> 2:41:13.320]  had leadership and supervisory roles in the Clinton and Russia investigations and who failed to meet
[2:41:13.320 --> 2:41:20.440]  the basic expectations of fundamental fairness. But there are tens of thousands of FBI agents and
[2:41:20.440 --> 2:41:26.280]  DOJ employees who do meet our exacting expectations. And we will not be calling their names today,
[2:41:26.280 --> 2:41:32.280]  unfortunately, because we don't do IG investigations on agents and prosecutors who do their jobs with
[2:41:32.280 --> 2:41:38.360]  character and professionalism. To those agents and prosecutors who do the right thing, the right way,
[2:41:38.360 --> 2:41:43.720]  and for the right reasons, we'll get through this. It will be tough and it will be difficult,
[2:41:43.720 --> 2:41:48.520]  but we will emerge on the other side with a stronger FBI and a stronger Department of Justice
[2:41:48.520 --> 2:41:53.480]  because we have to. We cannot have a justice system that based its decisions on anything
[2:41:53.480 --> 2:42:00.920]  other than facts. Do our fellow citizens watching at home be unrelenting in your expectations of
[2:42:00.920 --> 2:42:07.880]  our justice system? Never lower those expectations. Respect for the rule of law is the thread that
[2:42:07.880 --> 2:42:14.120]  holds the tapestry of this country together. And it depends upon you having confidence in those
[2:42:14.120 --> 2:42:20.520]  you empower to enforce the law. And importantly, do not ever accept the notion that those victimized
[2:42:20.520 --> 2:42:26.440]  or impacted or negatively treated because of bias or prejudgment have any burden of proving harm.
[2:42:26.440 --> 2:42:33.640]  Bias is intrinsically harmful. It is the making up of your mind based on anything other than the facts.
[2:42:33.640 --> 2:42:40.760]  To frame up. We use a blindfolded woman holding a set of scales to symbolize what we want in a
[2:42:40.760 --> 2:42:46.440]  justice system. And there is nothing more antithetical to justice than lowering that blindfold
[2:42:46.440 --> 2:42:51.640]  and making up your mind based on who is standing in front of you. That's right, but they made it up
[2:42:51.640 --> 2:42:57.640]  to begin with. We'll be right back. Stay well. Guaranteeing your food independence is a crucial
[2:42:57.640 --> 2:43:03.880]  part of prepping between debt crisis, natural disasters or even simple power outages. Having

[2:43:57.080 --> 2:44:02.920]  dramatic than it really is. The real drama can be found here in Leilani estates, but a lot of us on
[2:44:02.920 --> 2:44:09.480]  the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain. Volcanic ash
[2:44:09.480 --> 2:44:15.800]  may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[2:44:15.800 --> 2:44:23.080]  To find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH. What we learned was
[2:44:23.080 --> 2:44:29.080]  that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater. Next we tested
[2:44:29.080 --> 2:44:34.680]  the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe
[2:44:34.680 --> 2:44:41.800]  measure but the pH was also restored to optimal levels. As it turns out the filter on the Alexa
[2:44:41.800 --> 2:44:47.720]  pure raises the pH of the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can
[2:44:47.720 --> 2:44:54.120]  contaminate a rainwater supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it.
[2:44:56.040 --> 2:45:01.080]  The scientists at info wars life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support

[2:45:06.760 --> 2:45:11.560]  the most potent forms of turmeric available. Turmeric has been used for thousands of years
[2:45:11.560 --> 2:45:16.200]  and is one of the most studied herbals today. It is well known in traditional medicine for
[2:45:16.200 --> 2:45:22.040]  its soothing properties. Our pure turmeric extract plus peppering from black pepper makes for optimal
[2:45:22.040 --> 2:45:27.960]  absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system and so
[2:45:27.960 --> 2:45:34.200]  much more. Regular turmeric root from the store only contains one to five percent of active ingredients
[2:45:34.200 --> 2:45:40.360]  but our turmeric root extract contains over 95 percent of the active ingredients. Bodies combines
[2:45:40.360 --> 2:45:47.000]  turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm and thyme to work synergistically for

[2:46:43.400 --> 2:46:47.640]  to tell people by the local stations you're listening to. The bare minimum you can do is sign up

[2:46:55.320 --> 2:47:18.120]  winning. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:25.320 --> 2:47:32.040]  Being a privatized, they are turning our atmosphere into their atmosphere. We are
[2:47:32.040 --> 2:47:38.920]  like a natural resource to them. To clean the planet, move on to another. They want the
[2:47:38.920 --> 2:47:47.080]  dying indifference. They want us drugging. We could be pets. We could be food. But all we really are
[2:47:47.080 --> 2:47:55.560]  is lies. Our impulses are being redirected. We are living in an artificially induced state of
[2:47:55.560 --> 2:48:05.640]  consciousness that resembles sleep. We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[2:48:05.640 --> 2:48:14.600]  in the heart of the Resistance. All right, I should have played this video right up front
[2:48:14.600 --> 2:48:25.880]  in the broadcast. But I got my wheel spinning when I saw the Pito Fonda when he calls for
[2:48:25.880 --> 2:48:32.760]  his son to be kidnapped and raped. So Pito supporter, Pito voyeur, whatever. Peter Fonda.
[2:48:32.760 --> 2:48:47.160]  I mean, it is a good nickname. Peter Fonda. Peter Fondler. Peter Fondler. Peter Fondler.
[2:48:47.160 --> 2:48:54.200]  Peter Fondler. It fits. I'm not saying he's a pedophile. He just wants the kids to be kidnapped
[2:48:54.200 --> 2:48:59.880]  and put in cages with pedophiles and obviously raped. And he wants the numbers and home addresses
[2:48:59.880 --> 2:49:04.840]  of DHS employees giving out and people going to their homes and schools and quote stalking their
[2:49:04.840 --> 2:49:11.640]  children. I mean, that's such a crime, ladies and gentlemen. You know, under Clinton,
[2:49:13.080 --> 2:49:16.440]  I had Secret Service, FBI, all of it visit me over nothing.
[2:49:18.280 --> 2:49:21.880]  Over calling Clinton a traitor and a piece of garbage and I hope he goes to hell. They'd come
[2:49:21.880 --> 2:49:26.440]  and say, are you planning something? I'm like, no. I don't want Bill Clinton to turn into a martyr.
[2:49:26.440 --> 2:49:30.360]  Well, I want to ruin my life and be in a super max prison. No.
[2:49:32.760 --> 2:49:40.360]  But at a certain point when Peter Fonda and John Cusack and everybody's saying,
[2:49:40.360 --> 2:49:45.720]  burn down ICE facilities and kidnap kids and go to their houses and arrest their kids. I mean,
[2:49:46.680 --> 2:49:51.000]  I would be a liar if I didn't say that I would like
[2:49:51.000 --> 2:50:00.040]  to punch Peter Fonda right in those big old ugly Mr. Ed teeth. I'm not saying I'm going to do it,
[2:50:00.680 --> 2:50:06.440]  but when I hear about kidnapping kids, anybody's kids and put them in rape cages and he's just
[2:50:06.440 --> 2:50:12.920]  a sack of crap. He was never a good actor. His dad was a famous actor and then they've got this guy
[2:50:12.920 --> 2:50:17.000]  up there and it's just like, good Lord, why do I have to look at this person?
[2:50:17.000 --> 2:50:23.320]  I mean, who wouldn't want to slug him in the face? Let me be honest.
[2:50:25.000 --> 2:50:32.280]  Just another delusional washed up. The day he was born, never a big actor riding on daddy's
[2:50:32.280 --> 2:50:38.360]  coattails. And then now he wants to say all, he says all ICE people are evil. They're bad
[2:50:38.360 --> 2:50:42.920]  racists and they deserve going to their kids schools to scare them and their houses. And I
[2:50:42.920 --> 2:50:48.440]  want you to go after them. And then now Antifa got the article. It's from, it's pulling up some
[2:50:48.440 --> 2:50:56.840]  drugs report.com. It's on infowars.com too. Antifa, Antifa spreads a list of ICE agents
[2:50:56.840 --> 2:51:03.160]  and where they live compiled using LinkedIn and blasted over the internet. And ISIS, excuse me,
[2:51:03.160 --> 2:51:10.040]  Freud and slip, another produce group, Antifa are led by college professors and stratskyites
[2:51:10.040 --> 2:51:16.280]  and a bunch of them have been indicted and I'm done. I mean, you guys just keep pushing and
[2:51:16.280 --> 2:51:23.160]  pushing and pushing. But I know you're so low, you might bomb yourselves and blame it on me. So
[2:51:23.160 --> 2:51:28.440]  I'll never do that. But if one of you Antifa people I've already had punched me and hit me before
[2:51:28.440 --> 2:51:35.000]  years ago, if you ever lay a hand on me, I am going to clean your clock. You have been warned.
[2:51:35.000 --> 2:51:41.400]  I am going to turn it loose. It might take three seconds, but you're going to get punched really
[2:51:41.400 --> 2:51:49.000]  hard and your head's going to do a little basketball dance off the concrete. I mean,
[2:51:49.000 --> 2:51:52.200]  I'm just so sick of you little methhead devil worshipers.
[2:51:55.160 --> 2:51:58.040]  I'll be honest, I'd like to take a big bite out of your face.
[2:51:58.040 --> 2:52:08.040]  And I've had enough of your bullying crap. So and you're lying and you're just the scum of the
[2:52:08.040 --> 2:52:12.360]  earth. I mean, get them off the screen. I can't look at them. Whoever knows who those idiots are
[2:52:12.360 --> 2:52:22.200]  anyways. Oh my God. Yeah, there's the shot of the guy. There's a famous video where the guy walks
[2:52:22.200 --> 2:52:26.360]  over and likes his punching people and they fight back and he goes, I'm a tranny. I'm a tranny.
[2:52:26.360 --> 2:52:31.080]  I'm a woman. Don't attack a woman. Did you see the video last week that they aired it? I never
[2:52:31.080 --> 2:52:35.080]  got to it. Hey, I asked McBreen to put it in the folder. He might have forgot it might be there.
[2:52:35.080 --> 2:52:39.640]  We'll go ask him. I'm going to go into overdrive to cover this. I know Mike Adams is coming into
[2:52:39.640 --> 2:52:51.640]  house doing a great job. But can we show that footage of the kid last week who's in an after
[2:52:51.640 --> 2:52:56.760]  school program and he's trying to beat up adults. He's been reportedly kicking cars and then he's
[2:52:56.760 --> 2:53:02.760]  attacking this adult and the adult just pushes him down and he goes, there's this whole fake thing
[2:53:02.760 --> 2:53:06.200]  that he's hurt, then threatens everybody. I wanted a bleeped version of that.
[2:53:09.560 --> 2:53:11.800]  Yeah, here it is. We have the footage. Is this bleeped?
[2:53:13.880 --> 2:53:18.920]  But there's the full one too where they explain what's happening. He does it all. Okay, so back
[2:53:18.920 --> 2:53:27.480]  this up. This is perfect liberalism. They're going to attack you. He's reportedly in trouble.
[2:53:27.480 --> 2:53:31.400]  One of the people tells him to stop, knows the kid's mom calls him. This is a full like
[2:53:31.400 --> 2:53:36.760]  eight minute video. And the little kid looks like he's about 10 or 11 starts attacking some guy
[2:53:36.760 --> 2:53:40.840]  who's probably only five eight. He's not starting to fight. He lets the kid hit him a bunch. Finally
[2:53:40.840 --> 2:53:46.120]  the kid smack him in the face. So he pushes him down. Then the kid whines, screams, blows up.
[2:53:46.120 --> 2:53:53.320]  But this is perfect leftism. We're going to attack you. And then if you we're going to tell people
[2:53:53.320 --> 2:53:57.320]  bring your families, the borders are open. All these folks with disease, crime, hundreds of
[2:53:57.320 --> 2:54:01.000]  thousands died trying to get here. We just try to vet and find out what's going on.
[2:54:02.680 --> 2:54:07.240]  We fight back. And then you go, Oh, police, help me. I just assaulted them.
[2:54:07.240 --> 2:54:18.280]  So here, here's, here's the footage. Here it is. He's just called the kid's mom.
[2:54:18.280 --> 2:54:22.600]  That's what happens in the full video. Please get your son. He's starting to fight with all the
[2:54:22.600 --> 2:54:29.080]  adults. This kid is running wild. He's never really been put in his place. Now he punched him in the
[2:54:29.080 --> 2:54:37.640]  arm, hits him in the side, hits him in the face, hits him in the ear. Finally, he just pushes him down.
[2:54:38.840 --> 2:54:46.760]  And instantly the baby cry. Oh my God, Trump did this. You're the baby crying. We've got to like
[2:54:46.760 --> 2:54:53.800]  open the borders up. They are missing cars. He was, he called him and he starts, they start kissing.
[2:54:53.800 --> 2:54:59.240]  And now he cusses all the adults out. He says he's going to get his mommy and call the police.
[2:54:59.240 --> 2:55:04.920]  I told Sean to come out here and get this kid because he just kept running around here and
[2:55:04.920 --> 2:55:07.720]  cussing me and all that. I said, you need to tell this kid to get out of here.
[2:55:08.840 --> 2:55:13.240]  Sean came out here and told him to go and he went down right where he bikes at and
[2:55:13.240 --> 2:55:16.920]  turned and dropped his bike and ran back up there and started pushing Sean. So you
[2:55:16.920 --> 2:55:23.800]  don't need to put Sean in there. Yeah, he's a nice little kid.
[2:55:23.800 --> 2:55:29.080]  He was pushing right away. Now you want to fucking choke me? You're a piece of shit.
[2:55:30.120 --> 2:55:34.360]  You need to watch your language. You're gonna fucking choke me and throw me on the ground.
[2:55:43.800 --> 2:55:45.240]  I only pushed him 10 times.
[2:55:45.240 --> 2:55:55.160]  You fucking choke me and throw me on the fucking ground. You fucking get away. You need to step
[2:55:55.160 --> 2:56:02.280]  back. You are. You got some problems. Yeah, you got some big problems. Well, that kid.
[2:56:04.680 --> 2:56:08.200]  I'm sorry. Some little kids like 11 year olds were punching me four of the times. He's not going
[2:56:08.200 --> 2:56:12.600]  to get pushed down. He's going to get, then he wouldn't be talking crap anymore because he'd
[2:56:12.600 --> 2:56:19.320]  actually be on the ground. Nowadays, you can't even spank your kid. No, gotta give my time out.
[2:56:19.320 --> 2:56:26.920]  My dad would have taken me out his busy day to whip my ass. That's Mr. Foxworthy.
[2:56:27.960 --> 2:56:34.040]  Can you even imagine if my dad saw a video of me talking to women particularly like that,
[2:56:34.040 --> 2:56:39.160]  it would have been a serious situation. But that's the left doesn't want you to discipline
[2:56:39.160 --> 2:56:43.560]  your kids. They create these little spoiled monsters and then incubate them at the colleges
[2:56:43.560 --> 2:56:48.360]  and then turn them into these bullies that then go, I need some muscle. Call over this 20 year
[2:56:48.360 --> 2:56:54.280]  old thug. But let's go out to break with Maddow crying. Maddow so upset right now. She cares so
[2:56:54.280 --> 2:56:59.000]  much. Here's Mr. Maddow. Let's go out to break with her. Here it is. We've been talking about the
[2:56:59.000 --> 2:57:04.280]  story all night, but the AP has just broken some new news. This has just come out from the Associated
[2:57:04.280 --> 2:57:13.080]  Press. How fake is this? Trump administration has been sending babies and other young children.
[2:57:16.840 --> 2:57:21.560]  She's laughing during the fakeness. How bad is this? Some rubber headed to at least three.
[2:57:21.560 --> 2:57:31.960]  We put up the graphic of this. Put the graphic of this. Thank you. Do we have it?
[2:57:33.000 --> 2:57:35.640]  Three tender age shelters in south Texas.
[2:57:38.760 --> 2:57:40.360]  They weren't put in the general population.
[2:57:43.000 --> 2:57:43.480]  Then she laughs.
[2:57:45.240 --> 2:57:50.040]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of
[2:57:50.040 --> 2:57:55.160]  seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through mother nature to detoxify
[2:57:55.160 --> 2:58:00.760]  the body. That's why I'm introducing Z shield toxic metal and chemical defense support. It's
[2:58:00.760 --> 2:58:06.440]  made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with
[2:58:06.440 --> 2:58:12.360]  detoxifying the body and it supports the info or it is a classical 360 when this is the formula that
[2:58:12.360 --> 2:58:17.720]  I personally have been taking for over a year. And now we believe we have come as close to perfection
[2:58:17.720 --> 2:58:22.120]  when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get. You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your
[2:58:22.120 --> 2:58:27.720]  family and you owe it to the future of this country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as

[2:59:48.600 --> 2:59:51.240]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:59:55.080 --> 3:00:03.240]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:00:03.240 --> 3:00:10.680]  i talked to Nigel Farage who is the donald trump slash ron paul of europe
[3:00:11.480 --> 3:00:14.920]  a few weeks ago on the phone he said oh italy's gonna vote for independence it's all collapsing
[3:00:14.920 --> 3:00:21.240]  it's incredible but he said trump's gotta hold the course on immigration because that's the weapon
[3:00:21.240 --> 3:00:25.560]  of the globalist's great national sovereignty and once you start backing down they just get
[3:00:25.560 --> 3:00:30.280]  rid of borders entirely like europe's done well he has basically issued a warning to trump everybody
[3:00:30.280 --> 3:00:35.400]  else at merkel and all these open borders people are super unpopular they're imploding they're
[3:00:35.400 --> 3:00:44.120]  falling apart and it's critical critical uh that that that conservatives nationals libertarians
[3:00:44.120 --> 3:00:50.840]  not buy into this garbage so let's go ahead and play that clip from fox business today here it is
[3:00:51.480 --> 3:00:55.960]  so what do you think about what's happening in germany you know she was the most powerful european
[3:00:55.960 --> 3:01:00.840]  leader you know being in power for over a decade she was the dominant figure not just in germany
[3:01:00.840 --> 3:01:06.040]  between the entire european union and one decision has completely ruined her career and her legacy
[3:01:06.040 --> 3:01:10.680]  and it was i think the worst decision any western leader has taken in modern times as many of you
[3:01:10.680 --> 3:01:15.640]  just want to come can come over a million people came into germany and you know we've now seen in
[3:01:15.640 --> 3:01:22.440]  the last four years over a thousand people in europe killed or maimed by refugees coming into
[3:01:22.440 --> 3:01:27.240]  these countries and a new party in germany has emerged it's called the afd the alternative for
[3:01:27.240 --> 3:01:33.320]  deutschland it's getting near 20 of the polls and it's put the absolute fear of god into the
[3:01:33.320 --> 3:01:38.760]  establishment now she's got two weeks to try and convince the european union to change direction
[3:01:38.760 --> 3:01:43.320]  but it's a bit rich isn't it for the person for the person who opened the door to save the rest
[3:01:43.320 --> 3:01:48.520]  of europe it's time to get up she's finished the president the president says you know germany has
[3:01:48.520 --> 3:01:52.920]  this high crime rate that's gone up he gets lambasted by the media here saying that the crime
[3:01:52.920 --> 3:01:58.600]  rate has technically gone down but if you look at the numbers 2015 2016 and that's when kind of this
[3:01:58.600 --> 3:02:03.880]  all really became a problem uh the violent crime rate went up something like 10 in germany these
[3:02:03.880 --> 3:02:08.760]  are murders right oh yeah and 90 of those crimes were attributed to young male refugees this is
[3:02:08.760 --> 3:02:13.000]  coming from reuters and please don't forget crimes against women yeah i mean you've got good policy
[3:02:13.000 --> 3:02:17.640]  please remember the police were ordered to cover up crimes so they're much much higher that that's
[3:02:17.640 --> 3:02:22.360]  all over europe but remember that as well and again that's from the peak of three years ago it's
[3:02:22.360 --> 3:02:26.520]  gone down some because they've gotten control of it and it's slowed down now there's a new way of
[3:02:26.520 --> 3:02:32.680]  coming so continue crimes against women yeah i mean you've got basically what are called refugees
[3:02:32.680 --> 3:02:38.520]  are in fact young males 80 of them are under the age of 30 they come from cultures in which women
[3:02:38.520 --> 3:02:44.360]  aren't even second-class citizens is anyone surprised that you know the huge rise in sexual crime
[3:02:44.360 --> 3:02:50.680]  uh look immigration led to the grexit vote immigration led to the new italian government
[3:02:50.680 --> 3:02:55.800]  immigration will finish off angela merkel and president trump was elected on a very tough ticket
[3:02:55.800 --> 3:03:01.400]  of dealing with illegal immigration and now you've got the liberal media screaming at everything he
[3:03:01.400 --> 3:03:07.480]  does but the one thing's for certain if trump does not hold true and really tighten immigration
[3:03:07.480 --> 3:03:11.800]  many of those people who came out and voted for him won't do it again so he is you here too so
[3:03:11.800 --> 3:03:16.360]  let's take a look at some numbers because they're having a 27 increase in asylum seekers in the united
[3:03:16.360 --> 3:03:22.600]  states that's just in 2017 you mentioned president trump and his tough stance you also see the other
[3:03:22.600 --> 3:03:27.400]  side of this how this week especially the talk has ramped up about what's going on at the border

[3:08:06.680 --> 3:08:11.320]  jones alex jones alex jones but there's a lot of controversy around this network about alex
[3:08:11.320 --> 3:08:16.360]  jones google is being accused of hiding negative stories about hillary and her campaign
[3:08:16.360 --> 3:08:21.720]  by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the clit new body count story that's according to
[3:08:21.720 --> 3:08:28.280]  website infor wars mr ricketts confirmed there are recent shooters to the fully automatic weapons
[3:08:28.280 --> 3:08:34.840]  martin martin lucerskin has been shot to death in mental symmetry jfk was shot from the back
[3:08:34.840 --> 3:08:40.920]  and the front he would almost admit you were planned in motion it just panicked it took the
[3:08:40.920 --> 3:08:46.440]  baby out of incubators and left the children to die on the phone box i think this is a national
[3:08:46.440 --> 3:08:53.320]  security imperative we have clear things that we do not understand how they work operating in areas
[3:08:53.320 --> 3:09:00.120]  that we can't control ufo is this global governance at last is it one world the central bank is in
[3:09:00.120 --> 3:09:05.400]  charge is real claims the attack was accidental but some former us naval officers say it was on
[3:09:05.400 --> 3:09:11.560]  purpose they described the day's action as part of a continuing cover russian intelligence compiled
[3:09:11.560 --> 3:09:18.920]  a dossier on mr trump during visits to moscow russian scum denied everything he called it all fake news
[3:09:18.920 --> 3:09:25.640]  and he accused cnn of being fake news this is a national operation if they kill trump or remove
[3:09:25.640 --> 3:09:30.920]  trump it will cause a massive civil war in this country this is a theme of high level
[3:09:33.480 --> 3:09:38.280]  we are at war with russia are you aware that mr stone also stated publicly that he was in direct
[3:09:38.280 --> 3:09:43.880]  communication with jillian assange and wicks the white house the president are citing info wars
[3:09:43.880 --> 3:09:50.680]  they can shut us down you're next if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[3:09:51.480 --> 3:10:00.840]  it's alex jones and welcome to the fourth hour mike adam is here filling in for the fourth hour
[3:10:00.840 --> 3:10:05.640]  of info wars broadcast today it's a pleasure to be joining you today although i am concerned of
[3:10:05.640 --> 3:10:10.920]  course about the future of our nation and what's going on i want to hear from you in this segment
[3:10:10.920 --> 3:10:17.160]  so we're opening up the phone lines and i encourage you to call in on the fonda issue or border
[3:10:17.160 --> 3:10:23.240]  control how the left wing media is exploiting children yet again everything that they want
[3:10:23.240 --> 3:10:32.600]  to accomplish they have to exploit children the phone number is 877-789 alex that's 877-789-2539
[3:10:32.600 --> 3:10:39.080]  and please limit your topics for today to the border issues and the exploitation of children
[3:10:39.080 --> 3:10:45.160]  by the left wing media or what i call actually a journal terrorism if you think about it the
[3:10:45.160 --> 3:10:51.640]  left wing media has transitioned from you know a couple of decades ago you could say you could
[3:10:51.640 --> 3:10:58.200]  argue then that they were in the news business now they are in essence inciting a level of
[3:10:58.200 --> 3:11:04.520]  violence and hatred that will spill over into terrorism in the united states and this has already
[3:11:04.520 --> 3:11:11.800]  begun to happen we saw today i believe the arrest of one individual a democrat who was threatening
[3:11:11.800 --> 3:11:17.000]  the children of was that an ice agent or was that another member of congress i'll have to check the
[3:11:17.000 --> 3:11:22.120]  details on that but we're seeing the violence starting to break out now and remember we had
[3:11:22.120 --> 3:11:27.000]  that democrat go to the baseball game and try to shoot and kill conservative members of congress
[3:11:27.000 --> 3:11:32.760]  including uh well a senator rand paul who was there and survived that shooting and steve scolese
[3:11:32.760 --> 3:11:38.920]  of course was hit and potentially killed i mean nearly killed but he survived it thanks to uh
[3:11:38.920 --> 3:11:43.480]  medicine and thanks to emergency services and thanks to the capital police who defended him
[3:11:43.480 --> 3:11:51.960]  and what i see happening here you gotta understand this is an intentional agenda to push america
[3:11:51.960 --> 3:12:00.360]  into a state of open kinetic civil warfare this is this is an attempt by the media establishment
[3:12:00.360 --> 3:12:07.400]  to drive this country into a state of civil war so that they can call for you in occupation never
[3:12:07.400 --> 3:12:15.000]  forget this is about creating chaos this is about creating uh terrorism on us soil this is about
[3:12:15.000 --> 3:12:20.440]  protecting criminals through sanctuary cities and this is about creating so much chaos that
[3:12:20.440 --> 3:12:26.520]  eventually even if trump stays in office and even if he wins in 2020 and even if conservatives
[3:12:26.520 --> 3:12:32.280]  continue to win at the election booths they will still cause so much chaos and violence that they'll
[3:12:32.280 --> 3:12:39.320]  call for you in occupation of america that's where this is actually going once again info wars is
[3:12:39.320 --> 3:12:45.560]  ahead of the curve on understanding exactly where this is going and why the mainstream media the
[3:12:45.560 --> 3:12:50.600]  left-wing media is trying to push us in that direction bottom line they can't win on the merits
[3:12:50.600 --> 3:12:57.480]  of their arguments they can't win a debate so they have to censor everyone they can't win on logic
[3:12:57.480 --> 3:13:03.560]  and reason and historical facts they can't win on legislation so what do they do they resort to
[3:13:03.560 --> 3:13:08.360]  screaming babies that's their argument their argument is a screaming baby in your face
[3:13:09.000 --> 3:13:14.360]  that's the argument of the left because they have no basis anymore they have no logic no reason
[3:13:14.360 --> 3:13:20.200]  nothing let's go to rick in new mexico calling in on the line rick we've only got a couple minutes
[3:13:20.200 --> 3:13:24.440]  left but welcome to the show welcome to info wars let's hear what you've got to say on this issue
[3:13:25.320 --> 3:13:28.760]  good how are you today i do believe that founder should go to prison
[3:13:29.560 --> 3:13:34.600]  immediately and for the last two days i've been trying to call the white house switchboard
[3:13:34.600 --> 3:13:40.840]  to leave comments and messages for the president to have comey and me were put in prison immediately
[3:13:40.840 --> 3:13:48.600]  so rick i really appreciate your view on that i happen to agree with you but can you state why
[3:13:48.600 --> 3:13:54.520]  you believe that james comey should be imprisoned in particular well because he's been the clinton's
[3:13:54.520 --> 3:14:00.920]  patsy board for the last 30 something years when clinton was in arkansas he was his attorney general
[3:14:00.920 --> 3:14:07.800]  there coming up covering up me to arkansas all the drugs and how do you think someone like comey
[3:14:07.800 --> 3:14:15.720]  is worth 45 million dollars well let me ask you this rick uh do you think that there's any real
[3:14:15.720 --> 3:14:20.840]  chance that someone like james comey will actually face prison time in the united states is trump
[3:14:20.840 --> 3:14:25.880]  going to be able to drain the swamp or do we have a two-tiered justice system and there's no hope of
[3:14:25.880 --> 3:14:31.720]  ever holding these people accountable what's your take i'm hoping they get held accountable i really do
[3:14:31.720 --> 3:14:38.120]  and i've also called the fb i often hear new mexico and told him i you know that i just don't trust
[3:14:38.120 --> 3:14:44.600]  anything these guys say anymore and the jet doj system should be gotten rid of immediately also
[3:14:44.600 --> 3:14:49.400]  i think it's just to cover up everybody else's cover up well you are a well-informed american
[3:14:49.400 --> 3:14:53.560]  thank you for your call it's rick right new mexico thank you for your call i appreciate you
[3:14:53.560 --> 3:14:58.360]  chiming in i think many listeners and many americans agree with you we're going to go to another call
[3:14:58.360 --> 3:15:04.680]  right after the break which is coming up but i have seen on other other other websites that
[3:15:04.680 --> 3:15:11.800]  people saying that the fbi and the doj one website designated them as quote enemy combatants which
[3:15:11.800 --> 3:15:17.720]  you know i'd never seen that term for them i agree that the fbi at least at the high levels of fbi
[3:15:17.720 --> 3:15:24.200]  they are engaged in treason against america and i agree that the doj under obama was in many ways
[3:15:24.200 --> 3:15:29.080]  engage in treason and multiple felony crimes to designate them enemy combatants that seems to be
[3:15:29.080 --> 3:15:34.040]  a whole different level of discussion that maybe you know maybe we could entertain that discussion
[3:15:34.040 --> 3:15:37.160]  but for now i think we all agree there's a lot of people that need to go to prison
[3:15:37.160 --> 3:15:42.040]  and they're still in the fbi and the doj this is mike adams here filling in at info wars fourth

[3:20:00.200 --> 3:20:19.480]  we have breaking news here at info wars dot com reporting on the signing of an executive order
[3:20:19.480 --> 3:20:25.800]  by president trump he signed it just minutes ago this executive order ends family separation
[3:20:25.800 --> 3:20:30.760]  at the us-mexico border we're going to roll video from that signing right now and then have
[3:20:30.760 --> 3:20:33.880]  go into discussion and take your calls on let's roll that video executive order
[3:20:35.640 --> 3:20:40.360]  i consider to be a very important executive order it's about keeping families together
[3:20:41.400 --> 3:20:47.480]  while at the same time be sure that we have a very powerful very strong border and border
[3:20:47.480 --> 3:20:54.040]  security will be equal if not greater than previously so we're going to have strong very
[3:20:54.040 --> 3:21:00.200]  strong borders but we're going to keep the families together i didn't like the site
[3:21:00.200 --> 3:21:06.440]  or the feeling of families being separated is a problem that's got on for many years as you know
[3:21:06.440 --> 3:21:13.400]  for many administrations and we're working very hard on immigration it's been just left out in
[3:21:13.400 --> 3:21:19.960]  the call people haven't dealt with it and we are dealing with it so step by step just like we dealt
[3:21:19.960 --> 3:21:25.480]  with north korea we dealt with iran we dealt with an economy that was heading in the wrong direction
[3:21:25.480 --> 3:21:30.760]  we dealt with a lot of different problems this is one that has been done on for many decades
[3:21:31.640 --> 3:21:38.120]  so we're keeping families together and this will solve that problem at the same time we are
[3:21:38.840 --> 3:21:46.280]  keeping a very powerful border and it continues to be a zero tolerance we have zero tolerance
[3:21:46.280 --> 3:21:53.400]  for people to enter our country illegally uh with that i'd ask uh mike pence vice president if
[3:21:53.400 --> 3:21:58.680]  you'd like to say anything well thank you mr president and i think what the president made
[3:21:58.680 --> 3:22:03.560]  clear is we believe it's a false choice between whether we are a country of law in order a country
[3:22:03.560 --> 3:22:10.200]  you're listening to the signing of the executive order that ends separation of children a family
[3:22:10.200 --> 3:22:14.920]  separation at the us-mexico border just signed minutes ago listening to donald trump president
[3:22:14.920 --> 3:22:19.960]  trump and vice president mike pence speaking right now will be uh will continue with us and
[3:22:19.960 --> 3:22:24.440]  we'll have some commentary in a moment but now we'll be able in that prosecution uh in the
[3:22:24.440 --> 3:22:29.240]  immediate days forward to keep families together exactly forward but we are calling on congress
[3:22:29.960 --> 3:22:36.840]  to change the laws in this regard and in a broad range of areas that will secure our borders
[3:22:36.840 --> 3:22:43.160]  and give us strength and confidence that we are once again going to take the steps necessary
[3:22:43.160 --> 3:22:49.640]  to end the crisis of illegal immigration i think the word compassion comes into it but it's still
[3:22:50.440 --> 3:22:57.000]  equally as tough if not tougher and secretary this is just thank you for your leadership sir
[3:22:57.000 --> 3:23:02.600]  we look forward and expect the house to act this week uh we ask them to do their job the laws need
[3:23:02.600 --> 3:23:07.080]  to be changed this is a problem that president after president has dealt with for decades this
[3:23:07.080 --> 3:23:11.480]  one is willing to stand up and fix it we ask congress to do their part thank you sir for your
[3:23:11.480 --> 3:23:16.760]  giving thank you very much quick job the laws need to be changed that's what they're saying now at
[3:23:16.760 --> 3:23:23.320]  the signing of this executive order ending family separation of us Mexico border and here today once
[3:23:23.320 --> 3:23:30.440]  again president trump showing his brilliance by cleaning out obama's policy trash cleaning up the
[3:23:30.440 --> 3:23:37.480]  obama trash and starting the process here of neutralizing the democrats weaponizing of children
[3:23:37.480 --> 3:23:44.200]  against america nobody's taking care of it nobody's had the political courage to take care of it but
[3:23:44.200 --> 3:23:51.240]  we're going to take care of it you're going on been going on for a long time no no the border is
[3:23:51.240 --> 3:23:56.840]  just this stuff but we do want to keep families together this is a problem if you look at uh
[3:23:56.840 --> 3:24:02.360]  some of those horrible scenes from okay very important let me just summarize this because
[3:24:02.360 --> 3:24:06.520]  he's taking questions from reporters they're going to remain tough on the border there's
[3:24:06.520 --> 3:24:11.240]  there's still a zero tolerance policy for criminals in other words if you're a criminal with a child
[3:24:11.240 --> 3:24:15.960]  you're still going to get processed as a criminal this does not excuse criminals who try to exploit
[3:24:15.960 --> 3:24:23.400]  children this executive order does end the separation of families for other non-criminal
[3:24:23.400 --> 3:24:28.600]  processing including asylum at least that's my current understanding this was just five minutes
[3:24:28.600 --> 3:24:34.680]  ago so we're still getting information on what it contains president trump in doing this is taking
[3:24:34.680 --> 3:24:41.160]  away one of the most vicious weapons of the left-wing media which he can't even call media anymore
[3:24:41.160 --> 3:24:48.040]  they are in essence journal terrorist organizations that are trying to overrun america with illegals
[3:24:48.040 --> 3:24:55.560]  at the same time that they enrage the left-wing population to become violent derange frankly
[3:24:55.560 --> 3:25:01.480]  lunatics calling for violence like like fauna did earlier today peter fauna encouraging the
[3:25:01.480 --> 3:25:08.360]  targeting of children of border patrol and ice agents that's insane so president trump neutralizing
[3:25:08.360 --> 3:25:15.000]  this weaponization of children by the radical left once again taking a role of leadership for
[3:25:15.000 --> 3:25:21.080]  america now a question that i have and then we'll go to calls question that i have will a left-wing
[3:25:21.080 --> 3:25:29.080]  judge override this executive order in order to make sure that the crisis continues that's my
[3:25:29.080 --> 3:25:33.960]  question because of course you've got these radical left-wing activist judges all across america and
[3:25:33.960 --> 3:25:39.560]  even in hawaii who have a countermanded previous executive orders from the president in order to
[3:25:39.560 --> 3:25:46.280]  keep a crisis going this crisis is traction for the left-wing media they want screaming babies on
[3:25:46.280 --> 3:25:52.920]  tv they want to bypass rationality they want to bypass policy discussions and replace it with
[3:25:52.920 --> 3:25:58.360]  screaming crying babies and rachel madow crying on q on camera that's what they want so the question
[3:25:58.360 --> 3:26:04.120]  for right now is will a radical left-wing activist judge nullify or attempt to nullify
[3:26:04.120 --> 3:26:08.280]  this executive order by president trump so that they can continue to have a crisis
[3:26:08.280 --> 3:26:13.240]  to scream and cry about because they are cry bullies after all now let's go to calls because
[3:26:13.240 --> 3:26:18.200]  we've got a lot a lot of people chiming in on this alex you've been holding from michigan alex
[3:26:18.200 --> 3:26:23.560]  thank you welcome to the show let's hear your thoughts on this issue thanks mike what an honor
[3:26:23.560 --> 3:26:28.520]  to talk to you sir it's great to have you on go ahead i'm all signed up at real that video i'm
[3:26:28.520 --> 3:26:35.000]  stoked for that uh thank you yeah we're launching we're launching real that video it's in in two
[3:26:35.000 --> 3:26:39.320]  to three weeks it's the alternative to youtube and that's i'm spearheading that project so thanks
[3:26:39.320 --> 3:26:44.120]  for the plug yeah what an honor i mean they're banning all the holistic health channels on youtube
[3:26:44.120 --> 3:26:47.960]  right now because big pharma doesn't want that information going out so it's critical that real
[3:26:47.960 --> 3:26:53.720]  that video i'm talking to all the holistic health channels trying to get them all signed up anyway
[3:26:53.720 --> 3:27:00.920]  all to ms-13 and the border i was going to say that um the deep state really needs that ms-13
[3:27:00.920 --> 3:27:08.680]  infrastructure to run their drug running operations for their black ops and stuff good thanks and and
[3:27:08.680 --> 3:27:15.480]  assassinations of political targets wouldn't you say oh absolutely they they want those um
[3:27:15.480 --> 3:27:21.960]  ms-13 assassins out there ready to to be on call yeah so they they need this pipeline and they know
[3:27:21.960 --> 3:27:28.920]  that ms-13 gang members and drug runners and child traffickers sometimes pretend to be parents it
[3:27:28.920 --> 3:27:33.640]  doesn't mean that all parents are gang members obviously but within that set of parents there is
[3:27:33.640 --> 3:27:37.960]  a subset that are gang members pretending to be parents so what do you think is going to happen
[3:27:37.960 --> 3:27:45.960]  now alex that this executive order has been signed well i'm hoping uh you know the family stay together
[3:27:45.960 --> 3:27:52.440]  that that's a great thing um and i'm hoping that they continue to crack down on the gang
[3:27:52.440 --> 3:27:57.720]  members and i'd love to see a greater wall than the great wall of china built on our border
[3:27:58.920 --> 3:28:03.160]  well i would love to see families stay together who are americans too right and i'm sure you would
[3:28:03.160 --> 3:28:10.600]  as well i i would love to see the state uh stop interfering with families and parenthood in america
[3:28:10.600 --> 3:28:15.000]  i i would like to see the government stopping its medical kidnapping of children and i'm going to
[3:28:15.000 --> 3:28:21.000]  talk about medical kidnapping in the next segment here by the way anything else to add alex um i
[3:28:21.000 --> 3:28:24.600]  think that's it i'm not going to take up any more time than i have to i'm just stoked for real
[3:28:24.600 --> 3:28:29.160]  that video and everybody sign up right now all right uh thank you alex uh appreciate your call
[3:28:29.160 --> 3:28:32.920]  good points i'm going to talk about medical kidnapping when we come back because the government
[3:28:32.920 --> 3:28:39.160]  has kidnapped children from american parents at gunpoint for many many years to force them to
[3:28:39.160 --> 3:28:43.960]  take vaccine injections and chemotherapy that damages their brains their kidneys their livers
[3:28:43.960 --> 3:28:48.200]  their bodies this has been going on in america and there's not a peak about this from the left wing
[3:28:48.200 --> 3:28:58.360]  media don't give a damn want revenge on the common housefly well after 10 000 years someone has

[3:32:59.720 --> 3:33:29.400]  and we're back here on the alex jones show a day of breaking news at so many levels president
[3:33:29.400 --> 3:33:34.840]  trump has just signed an executive order ending the separation of families at the border but
[3:33:34.840 --> 3:33:40.920]  still maintaining a zero tolerance policy for illegal immigration obviously the solution here
[3:33:40.920 --> 3:33:45.160]  probably is to build a wall right i mean then then you don't have them showing up and you've
[3:33:45.160 --> 3:33:50.520]  got to stop the incentives so that these families in mexico and central america and south america
[3:33:50.520 --> 3:33:56.360]  don't send off their children to the united states through this very dangerous and treacherous journey
[3:33:56.360 --> 3:34:02.280]  during which many children are actually especially female children are are raped or assaulted some
[3:34:02.280 --> 3:34:09.320]  are kidnapped for child trafficking that is cruelty and that is what many parents of these
[3:34:09.320 --> 3:34:15.080]  children are doing to their children by sending them to america and that needs to be stopped as
[3:34:15.080 --> 3:34:19.000]  well so building a wall of course is a big part of this but let me mention something else and then
[3:34:19.000 --> 3:34:25.000]  we'll go to some more calls you know our government has been separating mothers from children
[3:34:25.000 --> 3:34:33.480]  for as long as i can remember and it's done in medical kidnapping medical kidnapping is where
[3:34:33.480 --> 3:34:38.680]  a government agency goes in and kidnaps children takes them from their parents because the parents
[3:34:38.680 --> 3:34:44.680]  don't want to subject those children to toxic medical interventions which include chemotherapy
[3:34:44.680 --> 3:34:50.200]  that causes brain damage by the way it causes cancer as its number one side effect as well as
[3:34:50.200 --> 3:34:57.000]  toxic vaccines so vaccines are being pushed onto children essentially at gunpoint through
[3:34:57.000 --> 3:35:02.280]  government coercion it's happened in maryland it's practically the law now in california it has
[3:35:02.280 --> 3:35:07.880]  happened in many other states as well michigan for example and medical kidnapping is a very real
[3:35:07.880 --> 3:35:13.880]  thing and yet you don't hear anybody in the left wing media talking about the separating of mothers
[3:35:13.880 --> 3:35:20.680]  and children in the united states of us citizens having their children kidnapped by the government
[3:35:20.680 --> 3:35:27.960]  and that takes place every day in america and cps child protective services does some good things
[3:35:27.960 --> 3:35:33.960]  but is radically overzealous in kidnapping children taking them away from parents who dare to question
[3:35:33.960 --> 3:35:39.000]  the ingredients in a vaccine thinking hey maybe i don't want to inject my child with formaldehyde
[3:35:39.000 --> 3:35:45.960]  or mercury or antibiotics and yes or msg all those things are in vaccines according to the cdc
[3:35:46.680 --> 3:35:53.800]  so don't talk to me about all all this screaming and crying about separating mothers from babies
[3:35:53.800 --> 3:36:01.080]  when in our country we have medical kidnapping we have an evil tyrannical medical police state
[3:36:01.080 --> 3:36:08.120]  regime inside our borders that no one is addressing where's our executive order on that you know
[3:36:08.120 --> 3:36:13.560]  where's even the media talking about that and also abortion you know abortion separates more
[3:36:13.560 --> 3:36:19.880]  children from more mothers than any other single medical procedure that we can think of and abortion
[3:36:19.880 --> 3:36:25.240]  is violent and they separate children from mothers using forceps if you think about it's violence
[3:36:25.240 --> 3:36:31.400]  it's medical violence and it is it targets low income african-american neighborhoods and it is
[3:36:31.400 --> 3:36:38.840]  done as a way to depopulate certain segments of our society as margaret sanger the founder of
[3:36:38.840 --> 3:36:43.080]  plan parenthood of course has admitted on the record so you want to talk about separating
[3:36:43.080 --> 3:36:48.520]  babies from parents you got to talk about abortion and medical kidnapping otherwise
[3:36:48.520 --> 3:36:54.200]  you're not fully informed so one more piece of news will go to calls a manhunt is now underway
[3:36:54.200 --> 3:37:00.920]  for a central pennsylvania man accused of threatening to kill president trump and other officials
[3:37:00.920 --> 3:37:06.520]  he is being hunted now by the u.s marshals because of course he's another person who is
[3:37:06.520 --> 3:37:13.560]  being driven to insanity by the journal terrorist left-wing media again you you almost can't even
[3:37:13.560 --> 3:37:21.400]  call them media anymore they are enemies of america cnn recently had to come out and say
[3:37:21.400 --> 3:37:26.920]  we're not enemies of the people well the only reason you have to say that is because frankly
[3:37:26.920 --> 3:37:31.400]  that's the way most people look at you that you are an enemy of this country that you despise
[3:37:31.400 --> 3:37:37.160]  the constitution that you despise our president you despise the electoral process you despise
[3:37:37.160 --> 3:37:45.960]  democracy you insult your audience and you exploit and abuse them cnn new york times
[3:37:45.960 --> 3:37:53.880]  washington post npr you name it they are through all of this fake or exaggerated reporting they
[3:37:53.880 --> 3:38:00.440]  are whipping up a level of intense hatred and anger that is about to spill over into mass
[3:38:00.440 --> 3:38:08.360]  violence on our own streets and that is the media's fault so let's go to calls bob in
[3:38:08.360 --> 3:38:12.680]  oklahoma euro on the air with mike adams here thank you for joining me bob what's on your mind
[3:38:13.400 --> 3:38:18.760]  hi mike how are you i'm all right man i'll tell you what i really appreciate everything you've
[3:38:18.760 --> 3:38:26.680]  been doing and i can't wait to get on to your new youtube eskik uh website as soon as possible
[3:38:26.680 --> 3:38:29.880]  well thank you we're working hard at it what's what's on your mind about the border issue
[3:38:30.680 --> 3:38:35.720]  well the border issues just i mean they're just nuts and i like what trump's done but all he's
[3:38:35.720 --> 3:38:40.840]  really doing is uh basically appeasing the left so they don't have anything to complain about and
[3:38:40.840 --> 3:38:46.520]  i think you're right i think we'll have a judge that comes out and tries to stop it but i also
[3:38:46.520 --> 3:38:52.520]  wanted to talk about your medical thing i mean uh i enjoy everything you put on your website and
[3:38:53.080 --> 3:38:59.720]  it's just awesome stuff and another guy and i know you know him quite well is john racaport who
[3:38:59.720 --> 3:39:06.840]  really has some excellent stuff about the vaccines absolutely and all that stuff so i'd like to get
[3:39:06.840 --> 3:39:13.080]  your here's some more of your comments on that but before i do one thing you got an all alternative
[3:39:13.080 --> 3:39:19.960]  uh website you know for videos coming out my question is is and and i'll hang up and let you
[3:39:19.960 --> 3:39:25.800]  answer this but what about the internet if we have so much technology i've never heard anybody
[3:39:25.800 --> 3:39:31.240]  brought this up why can't we create an alternative internet and just say screw these big companies
[3:39:32.040 --> 3:39:35.400]  well the the internet infrastructure that's a great question i appreciate you calling in with
[3:39:35.400 --> 3:39:41.480]  that the internet infrastructure is digitally neutral it passes packets the http protocol
[3:39:41.480 --> 3:39:45.960]  passes packets and doesn't censor them the censorship is happening at the corporate level
[3:39:45.960 --> 3:39:50.840]  google is censoring twitter is censoring facebook is censoring and more importantly
[3:39:50.840 --> 3:39:55.720]  they're doing it based on your political views they're they're shutting you off not for doing
[3:39:55.720 --> 3:40:00.360]  something illegal but for doing something that they simply disagree with here's a story i brought
[3:40:00.360 --> 3:40:06.920]  in today the stripe payment processor which is a big e-commerce processing company they're now
[3:40:06.920 --> 3:40:13.880]  now cancelling alternative websites freestarter just got canceled for payment processing bitchute
[3:40:13.880 --> 3:40:19.560]  and maker support just got canceled as well so this is the same thing that they're doing to
[3:40:19.560 --> 3:40:25.080]  gun companies where anybody associated with firearms is having their their e-commerce
[3:40:25.080 --> 3:40:31.480]  platform yanked where they can't process payments they're now doing it to these alternative websites
[3:40:31.480 --> 3:40:37.080]  what they're trying to do of course is a form of economic warfare against conservatives and libertarians
[3:40:37.080 --> 3:40:43.720]  and trump supporters it is extreme and and what you just mentioned here is exactly right on
[3:40:43.720 --> 3:40:49.800]  we have to fight back but we don't need an alternative http protocol what we need is frankly
[3:40:49.800 --> 3:40:56.040]  we need minimal government enforcement of a level playing field where you can't censor
[3:40:56.600 --> 3:41:01.240]  somebody's entire business or their channel just because they happen to be conservative
[3:41:01.240 --> 3:41:06.200]  let's take another call but thank you for your call sir sam in texas you're on the air with mike
[3:41:06.200 --> 3:41:11.400]  adam's here at info wars go ahead sam mike i've been watching counter thinking been having a lot
[3:41:11.400 --> 3:41:18.200]  of fun very informative a special thank you about the bio sludge the human waste that's been putting
[3:41:18.200 --> 3:41:24.040]  on farm fields and in landfills that's terrible stuff and it's all over it gets in the dust in
[3:41:24.040 --> 3:41:29.080]  the air yeah i think how many children are poisoned by that and yet we don't hear anything from the
[3:41:29.080 --> 3:41:34.440]  media about that do we that's really my point about what's going on the border this is the
[3:41:34.440 --> 3:41:41.240]  hugest switch and role reversal that i've seen in the media maybe since trump's been in it reminds
[3:41:41.240 --> 3:41:47.480]  me of the end scene in uh the brave new world where in the middle of a political rally the
[3:41:47.480 --> 3:41:53.400]  government switches their ally for their enemy and they say no we're not at war with eurasia we're
[3:41:53.400 --> 3:41:59.640]  what war with east asia we've always been at war with east asia right it's it's mind control
[3:42:00.280 --> 3:42:06.040]  yeah it's it's mind control propaganda it's social behavioral engineering at every level
[3:42:06.040 --> 3:42:12.440]  they're not the media anymore they are they're mind controlling a puppet class of obedient conformists
[3:42:12.440 --> 3:42:17.400]  who are now filled with seething hatred and anger and lashing out against the only people trying to
[3:42:17.400 --> 3:42:26.520]  save this country and that's people like you and me sam the tsa the party of the dhs the party of
[3:42:26.520 --> 3:42:32.120]  all of these huge bureaucracies of fema has been the democrats it's been clinton will even put the
[3:42:32.120 --> 3:42:38.040]  bushes in that category but they're the ones that built all this i absolutely get it into the

[3:46:44.520 --> 3:46:50.520]  that it's an honor to stand side by side with you the crew and the listeners out there 1776 worldwide
[3:46:50.520 --> 3:47:03.640]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:47:03.640 --> 3:47:23.080]  i can imagine a future debate on the senate floor about immigration policy or anything
[3:47:23.080 --> 3:47:29.480]  where you have ran paul standing there giving an eloquent explanation point by point logic
[3:47:29.480 --> 3:47:35.800]  and reason and history and that's the conservative argument and then for the democrats you have a
[3:47:35.800 --> 3:47:41.320]  democrat senator just hold up a screaming baby who cries and sobs on camera and just says
[3:47:41.320 --> 3:47:45.000]  this is my argument because that's what we're dealing with in america today
[3:47:45.000 --> 3:47:50.200]  there's no rationality behind it it's just screaming babies and crying babies sometimes
[3:47:50.200 --> 3:47:55.720]  photos taken completely out of context it's like democrat journalists are scouring the planet
[3:47:55.720 --> 3:48:02.120]  trying to find photos of of babies behind chain link fences even if it's in their own backyard
[3:48:02.120 --> 3:48:07.240]  to say oh my god they're in prison it's a holocaust it's a concentration camp it's insane that is
[3:48:07.240 --> 3:48:13.800]  not what's happening and frankly we don't treat our own citizens in many cases as well as some of
[3:48:13.800 --> 3:48:19.080]  these refugees are being treated or illegal aliens or undocumented immigrants or whatever
[3:48:19.080 --> 3:48:24.680]  term you want to use the fact is that we've got parents who are not doing a good job of parenting
[3:48:24.680 --> 3:48:32.840]  in america and we need to help our own country get a hold of raising good kids and healthy kids
[3:48:32.840 --> 3:48:36.920]  and kids who have a real education and not just indoctrination in the public schools i mean i
[3:48:36.920 --> 3:48:45.480]  could go on but we are on the verge of losing our our entire country where it's breaking down
[3:48:45.480 --> 3:48:50.360]  into idiocracy frankly remember that court scene and idiocracy where it was just like
[3:48:50.360 --> 3:48:56.440]  screaming theatrics and you couldn't even invoke logic and reason that's where we are now in america
[3:48:56.440 --> 3:49:01.880]  it has become idiocracy thanks to the radical left let's let's continue taking calls i think the
[3:49:01.880 --> 3:49:07.880]  name is beto in in iowa or beto uh you're on the air i'm sorry about your name you're on the air
[3:49:07.880 --> 3:49:16.200]  with mike here what's on your mind appreciate you taking my call as a latino you're in america and
[3:49:16.200 --> 3:49:24.280]  coming from seardown water makes mexico and my family as well it's really sad to see um
[3:49:25.880 --> 3:49:32.600]  us being used as a political football by the left that doesn't give you know anything doesn't care
[3:49:32.600 --> 3:49:40.040]  about us um and for us that came over here legally we have this frustration and with the people that
[3:49:40.040 --> 3:49:46.120]  are coming in here illegally because what makes them better than than us that came here legally you
[3:49:46.120 --> 3:49:51.160]  know yeah that's what they're trying to do it's trying to put they're trying to put us they're
[3:49:51.160 --> 3:49:57.000]  trying to have us in fight with each other amongst the latino community and they are definitely scared
[3:49:57.000 --> 3:50:01.240]  from people like definitely scared of people like me that are aware of their manipulation because my
[3:50:01.240 --> 3:50:06.120]  family voted for trump i mean people are sort of shocked so let me let me just confirm so you
[3:50:06.120 --> 3:50:11.400]  you immigrated to america legally through the legal process correct yeah and yes it takes a long
[3:50:11.400 --> 3:50:17.080]  time but yes you have to have patience you know you have to wait for god's plan i know my my wife
[3:50:17.080 --> 3:50:22.280]  is a legal immigrant we went through the process it took us six years i know exactly what you're
[3:50:22.280 --> 3:50:27.240]  talking about so what you're saying is that now you are being pitted against those who refuse to
[3:50:27.240 --> 3:50:32.760]  follow the law who want to cut in line so to speak and bypass the process and it's it's almost like
[3:50:32.760 --> 3:50:37.720]  if i'm hearing you correctly they're splitting the latino community apart inside america is that
[3:50:37.720 --> 3:50:42.680]  accurate well just like they do with the black community look what they did the cognate now
[3:50:42.680 --> 3:50:47.880]  they're sacrificing they're going to sacrifice any uh any person that's in there that's not in their
[3:50:47.880 --> 3:50:52.600]  race group think they're going to sacrifice this and they're going to try to you know demonize this
[3:50:52.600 --> 3:50:57.480]  but they're not going to do that especially with the internet and uh you know if everyone wants to
[3:50:57.480 --> 3:51:04.760]  start pointing fingers at the people that we should be mad at well bush obama um we should
[3:51:04.760 --> 3:51:11.000]  point the uh chief of staff back in march that gave you know who was getting giving bad advice to
[3:51:11.000 --> 3:51:17.880]  donald trump back in march of last year and it's and again i think that's just my just wanted to
[3:51:17.880 --> 3:51:22.120]  throw that out there for people that well to get mad at somebody i think those are the ones that
[3:51:22.120 --> 3:51:27.240]  need to be um pointed at you're right vato thank thank you for your call you're absolutely right
[3:51:27.240 --> 3:51:31.800]  this has been an ongoing problem as i said today trump has begun the process by signing this executive
[3:51:31.800 --> 3:51:37.320]  order the process of cleaning up obama's trash policies obama left a lot of trash behind and he
[3:51:37.320 --> 3:51:42.600]  left behind a lot of deep state agents to try to sabotage the trump administration now trump has to
[3:51:42.600 --> 3:51:48.760]  start cleaning this up obviously this problem has to ultimately get solved by congress we need a law
[3:51:48.760 --> 3:51:54.200]  that goes through the legislative process that is signed by the president that frankly builds a wall
[3:51:54.200 --> 3:51:58.760]  i mean if you build a wall you don't need to separate families you just turn them away it's
[3:51:58.760 --> 3:52:05.800]  like hey people you want to come to america follow the rules stand in line fill out the forms have
[3:52:05.800 --> 3:52:10.760]  a background check to make sure you're not a felon or a child trafficker from some other country
[3:52:10.760 --> 3:52:15.720]  follow the rules like the rest of us did like my wife did and like our caller did as well let's
[3:52:15.720 --> 3:52:20.120]  take another call fernando in arizona you're on the air with mike adams here thank you for your
[3:52:20.120 --> 3:52:26.280]  call go ahead hey good afternoon the health ranger and all the info orders out there awesome nice to
[3:52:26.280 --> 3:52:32.360]  have you on thanks pleasure to be on um so with like with the previous caller betha said um
[3:52:33.080 --> 3:52:41.080]  yeah it took my parents like 10 years to actually become citizens and what a lot of people lose out
[3:52:41.080 --> 3:52:48.280]  on is the quote unquote american way of life and especially the town that i'm from you know i was
[3:52:48.280 --> 3:52:55.720]  like a latchkey kid 2.0 where you know my parents had to come over here and so our family was broken
[3:52:55.720 --> 3:53:01.400]  up through through the limited jobs that they were able to get and uh things like that but
[3:53:02.760 --> 3:53:08.040]  um the oh there's a lot of like disinformation on the mexican side too where they tell them
[3:53:08.040 --> 3:53:13.080]  that there's all these jobs and everything like that here oh yeah exactly but you see obama also
[3:53:13.080 --> 3:53:17.800]  contributed to that remember when he was president he he rolled out the red carpets he said load them
[3:53:17.800 --> 3:53:23.000]  up on a train and bring them in and then and then he paid for buses to relocate these you know
[3:53:23.720 --> 3:53:28.200]  truly illegal immigrants at that point to relocate them to cities all across america
[3:53:28.200 --> 3:53:35.720]  and i i'm with you fernando we welcome immigration when it's done through a legal process and where
[3:53:35.720 --> 3:53:42.040]  we get to choose as a country a merit based system of deciding who we wish to invite in it's like
[3:53:42.040 --> 3:53:46.280]  you have a house you don't just open your door and say everybody walk in off the street everybody
[3:53:46.280 --> 3:53:50.840]  you get to pick and choose who comes into your house right right of course well that's that's
[3:53:50.840 --> 3:53:55.800]  the way it should be at a at a national level thank you for your call fernando i yeah go ahead um
[3:53:55.800 --> 3:54:01.400]  so one of the things that i wanted to bring up to you guys is the the threat that there might
[3:54:01.400 --> 3:54:07.640]  actually be a socialist president in mexico so a lot of people are kind of fleeing from that too
[3:54:07.640 --> 3:54:15.960]  oh wow yeah so i think i believe the name is lopez sobrador well people are fleeing venezuela
[3:54:15.960 --> 3:54:19.800]  right now people are fleeing they're trying to flee north korea if they can escape without getting
[3:54:19.800 --> 3:54:24.360]  shot and killed i mean look the one reason people want to come to america is because
[3:54:24.360 --> 3:54:30.040]  there is still a defense of the constitution here there's still a defense of individual liberty
[3:54:30.040 --> 3:54:34.680]  and especially places like texas where you can still arm yourself in self-defense we respect
[3:54:34.680 --> 3:54:40.920]  the second amendment in this state and that's why we don't have mass murders and rapes and mass
[3:54:40.920 --> 3:54:44.360]  shootings like you see taken place in other gun controlled states but thank you for your call
[3:54:44.360 --> 3:54:49.960]  again fernando let's go to westley in oregon because i really like to get a variety of calls
[3:54:49.960 --> 3:54:55.160]  and opinions uh westley uh you got anything uh on this or are you in line with what everybody
[3:54:55.160 --> 3:55:02.760]  else has said so far oh no no like i'm not good to talk to you good to talk to you too sir
[3:55:05.400 --> 3:55:12.200]  what what's on your mind oh man is he gone i dropped okay uh sorry maybe he probably just
[3:55:12.200 --> 3:55:18.840]  got excited and hit the hit the phone button uh trisha in virginia trisha you are on the air
[3:55:18.840 --> 3:55:27.080]  trisha thank you for calling what's on your mind thank you my thank you uh oh trisha got dropped too
[3:55:27.080 --> 3:55:32.520]  okay are we having problem with problems with the system i apologize to trisha and the previous
[3:55:32.520 --> 3:55:37.560]  caller let's try jordan in wisconsin just see if that goes through uh jordan you're on the air
[3:55:37.560 --> 3:55:44.840]  can you hear me oh yeah okay go for i apologize to the previous callers but go ahead jordan hi uh
[3:55:44.840 --> 3:55:48.440]  you've heard about everything happening in uh germany with the migrants and all the
[3:55:49.080 --> 3:55:54.680]  like mass rapes and whatnot do you think that could happen like over here with all the like
[3:55:54.680 --> 3:55:57.960]  considering the government took away all their guns and then invite all his terrorists into
[3:55:57.960 --> 3:56:03.240]  getting to fund themselves do you think anything like could happen here with all that well if i'm
[3:56:03.240 --> 3:56:09.400]  hearing your comments correctly let's be clear the democrats want to overrun america they want a
[3:56:09.400 --> 3:56:15.000]  flood of non-americans to come in and they want to take away americans guns i mean this is this is
[3:56:15.000 --> 3:56:20.280]  not a conspiracy this is what they are openly calling for they want open borders they want to
[3:56:20.280 --> 3:56:24.520]  flood the country they want to bring in people who will vote democrat this is their plan they
[3:56:24.520 --> 3:56:32.200]  they can't win through reason they can't convince americans to vote for democrats in enough numbers
[3:56:32.200 --> 3:56:36.280]  so they have to bring in people who will do it because they're uninformed they're illiterate
[3:56:36.280 --> 3:56:40.680]  they're uneducated they have criminal backgrounds you know they violate the laws that's that's a
[3:56:40.680 --> 3:56:45.720]  democrat party a bunch of lawless you know technically illiterate people at many levels so
[3:56:46.280 --> 3:56:51.000]  i mean does that answer your question yeah sort of i just i mean seeing that'll happen over in
[3:56:51.000 --> 3:56:54.520]  europe and just everyone just get overran and they're not even able to defend themselves
[3:56:54.520 --> 3:56:58.600]  because their government completely took away the ability to do so just seeing that's kind of like
[3:56:58.600 --> 3:57:02.920]  you know it's a shame because uh and you know she's got in the back of your head do you think
[3:57:02.920 --> 3:57:08.600]  well that can happen to us well it it it is happening to us jordan you're you're right on target
