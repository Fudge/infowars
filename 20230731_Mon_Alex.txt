[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.840]  It's Monday, July 31st, 2023. We've had some major developments happen here in the United
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:22.120]  States and around the world that I'll be listing right now. In the first two hours of the broadcast
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:28.800]  we have an exclusive interview that we're about to premiere with Steve Bannon and one
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.960]  of his top researchers that is publishing what is guaranteed, I believe, to be a best-selling
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.800]  book on transhumanism. We're about to cover the waterfront on transhumanism AI and how
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.740]  it is the religion and the blueprint of the globalist here today. But that's coming
[00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.640]  up in the first two hours. Then, in the third hour, we're going to get to all the
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.320]  other news. Russia openly saying they may use nukes on Ukraine after drone strikes on
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:05.560]  Moscow. We have Biden officially, as of tomorrow, planning to criminally charge and
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.240]  also civilly go after anyone manufacturing or selling incandescent light bulbs that
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.120]  put off that great warm light that's good for your mind. It's very similar to firelight
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:22.880]  or candlelight. They want you to be under the fluorescent microwaving lights that also
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.880]  should be used to communicate with smart devices in your house. I first saw that 20 years ago
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.120]  now it's mainstream news. We're gonna be getting to so much here today. But one of the first
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.720]  big things I wanted to hit was Fauci. Senator Paul has done the right thing and called for
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.000]  criminal charges against the criminal mastermind Anthony Fauci for lying about gain-of-function
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:49.240]  and lying to Congress and several other issues. He's given a referral, those criminal charges,
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:56.320]  to the Justice Department as of today. And even though the Justice Department is a captured
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.920]  institution in control of the globalist, this publicly convicts Fauci. This is exactly what
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.320]  we need to continue to expose these monsters where they're only going to prepare a new virus
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.800]  and a new rollout and a new attack. The White House took their former COVID head that
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.320]  Biden put in charge two and a half years ago and made him the head of the UN office that is
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:22.440]  creating the global UN treaty that supersedes, if we don't block it, our national healthcare
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.240]  laws and literally states that it controls healthcare policy and our bodies. So it is a
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:36.880]  very central issue to continue to expose Bill Gates, Fauci, the CDC, the NIH, the UN,
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.520]  and the whole globalist program, because they're openly saying that new viruses are about to come,
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.000]  new lockdowns are about to come, and Biden has created a permanent pandemic office so they can
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.880]  shut America down and basically put us in these emergency camps whenever they want. They're now
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.520]  admitting, by the way, as they are around the world, it's a UN-run program, it's global,
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.720]  that anyone that doesn't go along with the next lockdown or forced injections will be put
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.920]  in camps because you're involved in disinformation. It's not just the CIA and FBI censoring
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.440]  through big tech and surveilling people and all the illegal things that have now come out,
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.000]  including censoring, as Facebook just admitted last week with the new documents that Congress
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.640]  released, that they were told to censor truthful information and keep valuable information from
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.320]  the public, like if you had COVID, you immediately needed to go to the doctor and get a
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.800]  bunch of therapeutics and inhalable steroids and ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine and zinc,
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.760]  and that they blocked those early things, which increased the death toll consciously,
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:41.880]  whether you were in Australia, Germany, the UK, the US, Canada, Iceland, it didn't matter,
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.760]  it's all a unified global program of evil. Here's some of the other big stories we'll be
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:53.120]  covering today as well. China over the weekend was caught running a giant, clearly bio weapons
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:59.080]  lab, splicing all sorts of level four illegal viruses with other viruses and implanting them
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:05.720]  in lab animals. China has also been caught funding tens of millions of dollars, in some
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:12.040]  cases per state, directly at public schools to brainwash school children into the whole woke
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:18.520]  culture, which is again designed to bring America down. It's well known that 40% of
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:23.360]  transgenders all over the world, again, same numbers, commit suicide after their surgeries,
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.560]  whether it's male or female to the other quote sex. Well, now Canada is preparing to start
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:35.040]  euthanizing the transgender surgery victims, including young children, after they get depressed
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:41.160]  and authorizing that they be euthanized after the brutal Hellraiser surgeries. This is all
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.600]  coming up today. This interview coming up with Steve Bannon and others is incredibly powerful.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.520]  Please stay with us. Infowars.com. Tomorrow's news today. Please stay with us. Paul
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.960]  Revere's. Please spread the word about the broadcast. Please magnify the transmission.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.120]  We can and will stop these enemies. Stay with us.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:05.320]  For everything the globalists hit us with, God through Mother Nature has given us the answer.
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.360]  I don't have to sell you on CBD oil, full spectrum CBD oil, the incredible things it does
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.800]  for your nerves, your brain, your entire physiological system, for your nervous system
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.880]  particularly. Everybody knows it's incredible. It works. We have the strongest, best CBD oil
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:26.560]  you're going to find anywhere at the lowest price. Yes, you can find this same CBD oil for
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:32.560]  30% more because that's who we're getting it from. Made right here in central Texas.
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:40.120]  Our private label name is Rebel Zen. Rebel Zen is a private label of one of the top three
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.400]  or four CBD makers in the country. It's based right here in Texas and we're giving it to you
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.560]  at 30% off. And here's what's even crazier. 30% off of what they're selling it for.
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.400]  They're selling theirs for 30% off what their competitors are. So this is the highest rated,
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.360]  already the lowest price, not even a lower price.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.720]  Rebels in, get yours at infowarsstore.com now.
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:19.640]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:26.520]  And it's Monday, July 31st, 2023. We are kicking today's broadcast off
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:34.440]  with all the huge breaking news with Steve Bannon and his editor in the most important desk,
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:39.640]  I think, in his whole operation. That's transhumanism. Joe Allen. Now Steve's only got
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:44.120]  a couple of segments with this very busy guy. These probably works harder than I do when it
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.040]  comes to fighting the globalists at four or five, six shows a day. We've got him for 30
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:52.520]  minutes or so. Then I'm going to continue on with Joe Allen and his bio and what he's done
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.320]  and what he's written in this new book coming out. People that have read it and seen it
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.560]  are blown away. There's only a few people really that are ahead of the curve on exposing
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:04.200]  transhumanism and that's people like Joe Allen and Steve Bannon. And of course,
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.000]  we've been focused on it as well, discovering that it's really the religion
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.680]  of the globalists. Like where's the new world order want to take us? Where does
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.440]  cloth swab want to get us? With all the collectivism, you'll own nothing, you'll have
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:19.080]  nothing. The future's not human. Well, it's that. The future's not human.
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.600]  So to tell us about the new book and more, we'll put the book on screen,
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:27.560]  is Steve Bannon. So Steve, you're one of the leading experts on this. And for folks that
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.320]  don't watch The War Room, the people hiding under a rock, then introduce us to Joe Allen.
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:38.040]  Well, you know, Alex, you kind of inspired this back in 2004. I tried to make a film
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:44.760]  on transhumanism with after 2004, 2005. I tried to make a film when I was doing documentary
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:49.320]  films with Steve McEveety and the team that had just finished making Passion of the Christ.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.000]  I could never get a finance, but I always had an interest in it. But quite frankly, you
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:59.800]  and Info Wars inspired me that we had to do a much better job on War Room after we started.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:05.480]  We were following impeachment and different things. And I noticed, I read on the Federalist,
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:11.320]  I kept reading these really great stories about transhumanism. And I contacted the writer,
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:17.480]  Joe Allen, and he was able to get Joe over as an editor for us and putting up all his content.
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:23.320]  So, you know, I think that your show has been the leader. And what I've loved is that you've
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:31.560]  been mocked and ridiculed for over a decade, you know, maybe two decades for following this.
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:35.800]  And as we see right now coming out in what's coming out in the labs,
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:40.280]  coming out in this arms race, artificial intelligence, coming out with every day we're
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:45.080]  hearing more about CRISPR, you know, you were right and they are wrong. And that's why I
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:49.960]  think it needs a we've got to take this up next level. And I think we have to incorporate this
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.160]  into the MAGA movement, into the populist nationalist movement.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:58.520]  This is probably, as you know, the biggest single fight we've got because they're trying
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:05.160]  to go to Homo Sapien 2.0, Homo Sapien, you know, enhanced their great replacement
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:13.000]  theory is not about blacks or whites or Asians or, you know, any religious group or ethnicity.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.520]  It's Homo sapiens, human beings. And so I'm really excited about the book. I think it's
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:23.080]  going to be a tour de force. I think the timing coming up really with your two books of the last
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:28.040]  six months, the great reset first and then the in your new Great Awakening, which is going
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:32.840]  to be another tour de force, is going to really be able to launch us into the fall
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:38.680]  when people start coming back from vacation. And we have this run up to the 2024 election
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:42.280]  about the really the underpinnings of what this fight's about. So I think combination of
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:51.480]  Great Awakening and Dark Eon will arm our movement with as deep a thinking as you can get.
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:56.200]  If you went to Oxford or if you went to Harvard or if you were able to attend
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.880]  the World Economic Forum and get all the briefings they get, these two books, I think
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:06.600]  a combination would would arm every American. And quite frankly, all the international people
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:12.200]  watch our show with the intellectual infrastructure to think this through and to actually weaponize
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:16.760]  yourself, to stand up for mankind. And that's what Joe Allen's done. I'm not
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:20.120]  going to go over his whole bio until you've left us, because I know you've got to go soon,
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:24.200]  but he holds a master's degree from Boston University, where he studied cognitive science
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:29.320]  and human evolution as it pertained to religion. But let's just put the book back on screen.
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.720]  But hang on, I want to talk about that. This is the power of it, Alex, is that
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:39.240]  if you remember, Eric, I think one of the great analysts of American politics and culture
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:46.040]  was, I think, Eric Hoffer, who was a stevedore, who was a longshoreman, I think, in San Francisco,
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:50.280]  one of the great intellects. And he basically did it by reading and thinking. And, you know,
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:55.720]  he didn't have 10 PhDs or advanced degrees. The power of Joe Allen is not simply the
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.400]  master's degree he got at Boston University in theology, which is the same place Dr.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:04.920]  Martin Luther King went. But he's essentially, when I met him, he was writing, he was a rigger
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:09.400]  for a rock concert. He's a rigger, I mean, the most dangerous job.
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:16.520]  Anybody know, he's a true roadie, which is up in the rafters, you know, with a belt on. And
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:22.600]  he's a working class, blue collar guy like Eric Hoffer, who has actually done this by reading
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:28.040]  and thinking and not having to have 10 degrees slap to his name, a PhD from Cambridge or Oxford.
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:32.680]  Well, sure, he's got the common man, street smarts, and then the degree on top of it.
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:36.280]  And I've read a lot of your articles, I've seen you on the show a lot, and you're just piercing
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:39.160]  points. In fact, many times I've said to my producers, and now we're finally doing it,
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:44.920]  I'm like, I want that guy on. I want that person on. And we talk about this. I mean,
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:50.280]  there's so many important desks, there's so many areas that can be covered, the political desk,
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:54.440]  the environment desk, the military desk. But really, transhumanism is the whole globalist
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:59.400]  operation. Everything is a means towards that end. This is really their cult, isn't it?
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:03.640]  Absolutely. And I got to say, Alex, I really appreciate everything you've done. You've
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:09.960]  blazed a trail that I'm simply following along behind, right? I mean, what, 15 years ago,
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:14.840]  when I was doing cuts for The War Room to bring you on that first time, I'm looking back,
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:20.440]  what is the oldest clip I can find of Alex Jones calling out technocracy and transhumanism?
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:24.520]  The earliest I could find on the internet was in the late 90s, right? When you're calling out
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:30.520]  the biometric sensors, I believe, at an airport, something like that. And then
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:37.480]  not long after that, you are criticizing Ray Kurzweil. You're really the only person
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:43.320]  at that point who wasn't blowing smoke up his ass, right? Forever, all you ever heard
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:48.680]  about Ray Kurzweil, bold futurist, this is where technology will take us, this will be
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:53.320]  our salvation. And you're coming in like, no, there's a serious dark side to this. This is
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:59.400]  a totalizing movement. And I think that, anyway, much appreciation to you.
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.760]  Well, I appreciate the appreciation. I want people to know, now it's all out in the open.
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:06.120]  So what you and Steve are doing, I learned from when I watch the show almost every day,
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.720]  and you're covering this. But I want listeners to know, this isn't like some weird science
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:15.880]  thing in some basement at MIT. This is everything, the social credit score, the global government,
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:20.760]  the transgenderism. I mean, I said 20 years ago that the transgenderism movement is
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:24.200]  basically an intelligence agency op, because I read their own documents that are public,
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:28.840]  to begin the whole transhumanist movement. Because if you can say a man can be a woman,
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:33.240]  well, then a man can be a cyborg. And so, sure, I covered it in the past, but you guys
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:37.560]  are really more up to date in many ways in the future. So while we have Steve here, and
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:40.600]  we're going to spend almost an hour if you've got time to walk through the book, and I can't
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:45.400]  wait to read it. You said something on your show when I was on with you last week, The
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:51.480]  War Room, that if people are into Oppenheimer and Into the Bomb and all this, which is very
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:55.480]  interesting, and I went and saw it, kind of a communist apologist, but still, it's overall
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:14:02.520]  a decent movie. I'd go see it again. But this, what we're witnessing is the Manhattan
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:06.040]  Project to the 10th power. You've said some incredible things, and that really ties into
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:10.520]  transhumanism, that this is the elite, the technological elite that Eisenhower warned of,
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:15.880]  getting full control of the decisions governing the evolution of technology and humanity.
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:22.040]  A hundred percent. And I want to go back to something Joe Allen said and tied together.
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:29.000]  Remember, today, it's Monday, July 31st. You know, over the weekend, the last couple
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.080]  of days, I know you and Joe are getting into detail, we've had World Coin, which is what,
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:38.840]  a biometric, you know, you were warning people about this in 1999. We got the clip.
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:44.200]  In fact, when I was trying to do, the film was called The Singularity off of Kurzweil's book.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.360]  I didn't know who you were, but one of the clips I had seen was you talking about
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.640]  Kurzweil and talking about the dark underbelly of Kurzweil when people thought,
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:55.560]  hey, this is going to lead us to a promised land. And that brings us up today. When people
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:59.240]  see the Oppenheimer film, and I recommend people do see it, and Alex, once again,
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:05.400]  you nailed it because it is more apologetic for the communists and particularly the people
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:12.360]  that stole the secrets of the atomic bomb and the hydrogen bomb. But today, we're in a race.
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:20.040]  Don't think Oppenheimer is just about history. This is all about right now. This is all about
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:27.320]  today because this race for AI, we're in an arms race. So the horse is out of the barn.
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:32.120]  We're going to have a very difficult time controlling this, not just because the capitalists,
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:38.120]  which is bad enough and what's happening on Wall Street and Silicon Valley, but we're now in
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:43.880]  an absolute arms race with the Chinese and others. And our administrative state and deep
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:48.760]  state is bound and determined to win that. So I think that that is an issue before everybody.
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:55.320]  This will be one of the biggest issues of the 2024 presidential campaign. And they're going to
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:59.720]  say, oh, it's about deep fakes and misinformation. And they're making up commercials on
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:05.240]  Trump. It's so much deeper than that. This world coin launch over the last couple of days,
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:10.040]  we are now into it because this gets to the thesis of depopulation. You can
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:15.960]  absolutely see that that is the overall plan. Their plan is to transcend humanity,
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:24.040]  transcend homo sapiens, have a enhanced homo sapien. They're focused on eternal life.
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:28.360]  They're complete atheists. They're absolutely focused on eternal life. They want a massive
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:33.320]  depopulation of the Earth's planet in total control using artificial intelligence and other
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:40.120]  means. So this is the big battle we're going to face, right? And what they're going to start
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.600]  turning all their cards on the table is this battle right here.
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:47.160]  I could not say it any better. I mean, this is their cult. This is their movement.
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:51.400]  They brag about it, not just Klaus Schwab, but you all know, Harari is like their high priest
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:58.760]  has Hitler quotes about useless people and unwashed masses. And I mean, they're actual
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:04.920]  terms, useless eaters and things that Hitler would use. And it's surreal to read history
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:10.920]  books and know about it and understand that that stuff that Hitler said, and now he's saying it,
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:14.680]  but it's the liberals saying it. But then we know that it was the left created
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:19.000]  Cold Springs Harbor and eugenics in New York City and in London, England, that Hitler's
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.600]  surviving Nazis until we hung them at Nuremberg bragged, hey, we were just getting our direction
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:29.320]  from the Rockefellers and from Cold Springs Harbor and from the British eugenicists.
[00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:32.520]  That was their defense. And really, I'm not defending what they did,
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:36.680]  but it's true. How are they getting in trouble when they were just implementing
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:40.600]  what they were learning from the left? But the left doesn't want to just kill this group
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:44.760]  or that group. They want to depopulate basically everybody. I mean, they talk about what
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:49.240]  Prince Charles and his father, King Charles's father, Prince Philip, talked about wanting to
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:54.600]  come back as a virus to go 80% of the world. The UN talks about 500 million being the
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:59.800]  ideal number, Joe. Well, look, I think that there's a lot of different agendas coming from
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:04.040]  a lot of different places, some more gradual than others, some more extreme. But what you're
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:09.800]  talking about, the Prince Charles quote, for instance, I mean, there is a deep anti-human
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:15.560]  strain in the elite class. There's a deep anti-human strain in the academic culture,
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:19.880]  and it comes out of environmentalism. But I think it also comes out of a kind of a general
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:28.520]  snottiness towards the so-called future useless class. I think Harari is an interesting
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:35.800]  figure for a lot of reasons, maybe most because he is demonized for talking about
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:43.080]  these policies of replacing working class people with robots. He is demonized for talking about
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:50.200]  the rise of a sort of techno-humanist homo deus. Whereas it's really, I think, very disturbing,
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:55.400]  and Steve has been at the forefront of criticizing this guy, Elon Musk is working on
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:19:02.600]  these projects. Elon Musk, he has this reluctant sort of air that, oh, this is the way things
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:07.480]  are, so this is what I must do. But it doesn't really matter one way or the other. That's what
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:12.920]  he is doing. And so when you talk about the danger of artificial intelligence, artificial
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:18.280]  general intelligence, you talk about the danger of a fully autonomous sort of infrastructure.
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:23.880]  There's nothing more emblematic of a fully autonomous infrastructure than having highways
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:29.160]  full of autonomous vehicles that can be turned off with a switch, right? There is nothing
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:33.880]  more, I think, ominous than the statements he made in Shanghai during the pandemic
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:39.720]  when he's talking to Jack Ma. And it's interesting when you look at the Chinese media
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:44.040]  version, they of course cut that part out, but it's readily available. It's not like it's a
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:50.920]  secret. And he talks about how the future is AI coding, right? That is going to be the last
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:58.200]  job on the planet until, of course, AI writes its own code. And so I think
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:02.200]  that dichotomy, I go into it in the book- And then it would be fully autonomous. Sorry,
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:07.480]  go ahead. I go into it in the book, that dichotomy between Elon Musk, who is working
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:12.920]  on these things and is valorized by the right and the center and some of the best and most
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:18.680]  sane minds I know. Whereas Yuval Noah Harari, of course, he's associated with the World
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:24.920]  Economic Forum at TED, all these sorts of techno fetishist organizations. But he is merely talking.
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:29.880]  It's not like Yuval Noah Harari is cooking nanobots in his basement, right? He is simply
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:34.760]  a historian who is held up as a sort of elite mouth- He's here like in Star Trek,
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:38.760]  when the board arrived, they go, you will assimilate. This is futile. That's really
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:42.840]  what he says. He says, you won't stop us. The future's not human. These are quotes.
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:46.520]  Absolutely. I can't wait to read your books. I've seen you on the show. You really have got
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:51.560]  cutting edge info. I learn a lot. Let's talk about the cover of the book and what the name
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:57.000]  means. I mean, I certainly get the title about transhumanism, the war on humanity. That is
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:03.320]  nailing it. What does the main title mean? So Dark Eon, this is something we actually fought
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:09.000]  a bit about and Steve was insisting, not Steve and I, but others on the team, Steve insisted,
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.600]  I think rightfully so. I'm very glad. Dark Eon. So Eon has two different meanings.
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:19.640]  Of course, the spelling, right? With the Latinized rendition.
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:21.160]  Thousand year, but also kind of Elon.
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:25.880]  Actually, I didn't put that together, but I guess it does, it rhymes, right?
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:31.720]  Elon may not be the Antichrist, but it rhymes somehow. So Eon though, of course,
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:38.600]  is a period of time, a long stretch, an epic. But Eon is also the name of these
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:43.800]  Gnostic entities, right? You could say a god or a goddess, although that wouldn't be exact.
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:48.680]  Gnosticism, there are strains of Gnosticism that run deep in the transhumanist movement.
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:49.880]  Absolutely. And their thinking.
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:55.080]  The argument I make though, and I'm certainly not the first to point that out and I'm actually-
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.920]  No, you're right. They believe they're building a new god.
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:01.160]  Absolutely. But the difference between the transhumanist and the Gnostics,
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:04.680]  and I think this is a really, really important point, is at the center of the book.
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:11.000]  The difference is that whereas Gnostics see spiritual reality as the highest and the
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:17.800]  material as evil, the transhumanist movement by and large, with very, very few exceptions-
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:18.680]  They inverse it.
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:22.920]  They reverse that so that they are now creating a spiritual realm.
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:28.040]  They are spiritualizing matter through a more complex matter, digital technology.
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.640]  Wow. And that's why I'm saying you're so cutting edge while you're giving me credit.
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:34.360]  Let's just stop doing that. I tune into The War Room, and I'll just say this for other
[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:39.800]  shows. The War Room that Steve Bannon's put together with all the guests, it's like,
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:44.760]  there's nothing like it. I guarantee you, if they put The War Room lineup on Fox News,
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:48.200]  it would have 20 million viewers an hour instead of 4 million or 2 million.
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:52.120]  And of course they put my show on, that would be the same thing, but more because it's wild
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:56.360]  and crazy. But that just shows how hungry people are for the truth and that you guys
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:23:01.720]  have really cracked the code on what these guys are doing and just how wild this is.
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.600]  And that's why they want to get rid of all the other religions, get rid of Christianity,
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:07.880]  because it has to make way for what Elon Musk said,
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:12.760]  beware of those that worship AI gods. But I agree with Steve,
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:17.000]  I don't trust Elon Musk as far as I can throw him. He knows liberty is popular.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.040]  He knows things are tipping towards the new Renaissance, the great awakening.
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:26.760]  So he wants to be the lesser of two evils. He wants like the WeChat type system,
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:33.320]  a one system to control us all. They need internet ID. They need to be able to train their
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:38.280]  AI with hundreds of millions and millions of people. They need to be able to then have
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:42.680]  the digital cashless tokens and he's getting everything in one spot and admits that.
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:47.480]  So Steve Bannon, you're a leading researcher on Elon Musk. I really respect your view on him.
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.680]  Who do you think he really works for? What do you think he's really up to?
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:57.400]  He's as close to the anti-Christian as you possibly have. Everything about him is
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:02.520]  completely, look, he is a great engineer. He may be the Tesla or the Edison,
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:06.200]  however you want to describe it, of this generation. On the engineering side,
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:11.160]  although you can tell he doesn't know all engineering, that's why Twitter is still a mess.
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:15.560]  I mean, you know, Getter and all these other smaller apps are much better technologically
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:19.720]  than Twitter by orders of magnitude. He hasn't been a solid then. He's known the thing for
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:24.840]  over a year. But he is a great engineer. But he's totally controlled by the Chinese
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:28.680]  Communist Party. They finance it all. And you can tell that the way he suppresses anti-CCP
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:34.600]  voices, they suppress voices all the time. Is that why I'm still banned? People ask why.
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:39.240]  He said, I deserve to be thrown into the ocean with a millstone around my neck.
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:42.520]  Yeah, she said that. I remember that. I'm sorry. I don't mean to write myself into this.
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:47.160]  No, no, no, no, no. You're a perfect example. Your show, I think, is the most important show
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:50.840]  in America and has been the most important show in America. And let's leave all the other issues
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:56.600]  aside. They're trying to put you in bankruptcy and liquidate your company and basically drive you
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:00.760]  from the United States. But your show, if you look at the quality of your show every day,
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:09.080]  look, World Coin this weekend is doing exactly what Alex Jones warned everybody was going to
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:16.200]  happen in 1998, 1999, 24, 25 years ago. I think virtually most of your major
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:23.880]  lines of thought, your lines of work have either come true or is now being revealed that
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:28.200]  there's something there. And the question's got to be if Elon Musk is for free speech,
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:31.800]  why is Alex Jones' show not on there? Why is Miles' quote not on there?
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:36.200]  Why is War Room? Remember, War Room's banned. War Room's banned from Twitter.
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:40.680]  They banned our account. I've never pushed them to be on because I don't want to help
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:44.520]  make money for the Chinese Communist Party. I do want to say something about these two books,
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:48.680]  though, and the importance of them. And this is why you don't need Elon Musk.
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:55.320]  You've got The Great Awakening that's coming out either later in August or early September.
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:59.000]  You got Dark Ian coming out later in August, early September. In the next 30 days, you can
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.640]  pre-order both these books. I'm honored to have written the introduction for both of them.
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:10.200]  Here's the connective issue is that when in the French Revolution, in the Bolsheviks,
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:17.640]  in Mao Zedong, the one thing that they feared the most, the only thing that could stop a
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:24.200]  communist revolution was what was called the kulaks. And the kulaks were essentially
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:29.080]  the people in the village, the peasants, right? The peasants that were really
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:34.120]  the most organized, the most squared away, had really made something of themselves,
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:39.960]  and the village looked up to them. And whether this is in Ukraine in the 1930s or in the
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:45.880]  countryside, in the Vendome during the French Revolution, or Mao Zedong going out in the
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:52.440]  Cultural Revolution, the number one thing that communists have to do to win to break a society
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:58.520]  is to destroy the kulaks, to destroy the most squared away peasants. And that's what the
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:06.920]  audience of Alex Jones' Infowars were remiss. We play towards a working class, middle class
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:12.840]  audience who wants to be informed. These two books will help you go to the next level.
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:16.360]  As I keep saying, we're not there to make sure you're the most interesting
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:20.600]  person at the backyard barbecue or sitting in the stands at the little league game.
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:26.520]  We're there to make sure that you're the most informed person, so that those times
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:31.000]  when you're in a boardroom, or you're at the parent-teachers' conference, or these
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.480]  school boards are trying to take over, that people start to look to you as an informed
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:41.720]  individual that has a deep understanding of what's happening on world trends, on both science,
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:47.320]  religion, culture, civilization, geopolitics, economics, all of it. And these two books
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:52.520]  are really the books for the kulaks, right? And remember, that's why they try to shut down
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:57.560]  Infowars. That's why they try to drive Alex Jones into bankruptcy. That's why they
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:00.840]  come after the war room and try to, we're deplatformed everywhere, and that's why they're
[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:05.720]  trying to put me in prison, along with Trump, for dozens of years. It's all the same thing.
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:12.520]  But we can't fail if the people that we try to give access to this information
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:16.760]  gets the information and then incorporates the information. And that's why I'm really proud,
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:22.360]  I think, to kick off, really, this massive cycle of 2024 a year in advance.
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:26.760]  You're going to have two books that really talk about the two most fundamentally important
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:29.720]  things. You know, we have election fraud and invasion of the southern border and the
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:34.200]  Ukraine war, all of that. You know, the coming Durbin conference on the dollar,
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:40.920]  there's all these things you're talking about. But underpinning that is the juxtaposition
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:46.360]  of the potential of a dark eon, coupled with a great awakening of the Judeo-Christian West,
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:52.680]  led by the patriots in the American republic. And that is the great war before us.
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.320]  And the big event coming up.
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:09.960]  Well, yeah, the first one, you obviously can go to mypillow.com,
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:15.880]  use that promo code Alex, and you can get all these great discounts on all of our products. And
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:21.160]  just by visiting this site, you're going to get a $20 free gift emailed to you immediately.
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:25.480]  And there's the biggest special we have right now, the 20-year anniversary My Pillow
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:31.800]  for 1998, for the queen size, normally $69.98. We're celebrating our anniversary with
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:36.920]  what my employees love doing best, producing and making the My Pillow.
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:44.280]  And the model of businessmen and women with can-do know-how, using the money for Americana
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:47.880]  freedom to fight the globalist is what they fear. That's what the deep banking is about.
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:51.640]  That's what the financial attacks are about. That's why we've got a rush to support
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:55.640]  mypillow.com and infowars.com, plus their great products at both places,
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:57.480]  because we are the tip of the spear.
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:06.600]  We finally have our original best-selling colloidal silver back in stock. With the
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:11.240]  supply chain breakdowns and all the problems of the economy, we could not get the highest
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:17.000]  quality colloidal silver for almost three years back in stock. But now we've got it
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.480]  30 parts per million from the top lab. We've got a limited shipment. Hopefully we'll have a
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:25.800]  lot of it in the future. But if you want to experience and have in your medicine cabinet,

[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:03.400]  The globalists are only humans. Yeah, they have control of the central banks. They have
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:07.320]  a lot of power, but they can be defeated. But some of their operations are going to take
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:11.720]  decades to stop. But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:16.920]  and your family's body by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with,
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:20.520]  and you do it with the highest quality gravity fed filter out there.
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:25.400]  This thing does 10,000 gallons. You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through it a day.
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:30.040]  It purifies very quickly, and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:33.400]  This is what I use, which my family uses. It's the very best system out there for the
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:39.480]  lowest price, for a limited time, 10% off on top of that, exclusively at infowarsstore.com

[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:48.600]  that need those in stock. Get it today, and it funds the infowars. Don't procrastinate.
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:52.680]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the globalists
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:56.200]  from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply. In some cases,
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:33:03.880]  they add the water supply like fluoride. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:08.520]  the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:28.750]  People are really getting it's a globalist religion of AI, it's a technocracy, it's a
[00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:32.970]  post-human world, it's people that have anointed themselves God over us and decided they quote
[00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:37.710]  control the quote direction of human evolution. Whether you believe in evolution or not, they
[00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:42.350]  do and they're saying they've taken control of it with directed evolution and Steve's going
[00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:44.550]  to leave us in a few minutes. You're going to have the floor, Joda, because you're very
[00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:47.810]  knowledgeable while watching The War Room to lay out this incredible book. Your book
[00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:51.410]  has been printed. One is in the mail. I'm told FedEx is going to pull up any minute. I
[00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:55.610]  can't wait. I'm going to read it. Mine is about to be printed. We're finishing
[00:33:55.610 --> 00:34:00.810]  it literally like today or so and then a few minor, you know, the editor will check
[00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:05.150]  it because we wrote too much and then it's going to be in print. But it's important
[00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:09.510]  for people to pre-order these. Yours is about to come out just in a few weeks, mine
[00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:13.450]  comes out in a few weeks as well. Literally hot off the presses to drive it to number
[00:34:13.450 --> 00:34:16.790]  one on Amazon, then it drives it to number one on all the other platforms and
[00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:20.910]  then it culturally punches through and then we do interviews all over the media and
[00:34:20.910 --> 00:34:27.390]  this is basically ambassador information to the world about what's really happening
[00:34:27.390 --> 00:34:31.950]  and this is the central issue. This is what the globalists actually are doing. It's
[00:34:31.950 --> 00:34:35.950]  their blueprint and if people don't know this, then they have no hope. If you know
[00:34:35.950 --> 00:34:40.230]  it, it's quite easy to beat the enemy. As the Bible says, the people perish for
[00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:44.850]  lack of knowledge and so this is, this is so important that everybody get the new
[00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:51.290]  book Dark Eon by Joe Allen from Skyhorse Publishing and amazon.com right now and
[00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:56.210]  it's super important that you get The Great Awakening and the fact that we are going
[00:34:56.210 --> 00:35:01.750]  to defeat the globalists and that we're going to launch a new renaissance. Both books
[00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:11.670]  have really a lot of great information because I've been told by folks that have read your book, it's incredible and my book has a lot of great info I gotta say. I just got a great intro from Steve Bannon, but this is a
[00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:16.830]  political weapon. We have the truth, they have lies and I'm telling you, this is
[00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:31.590]  critical information. I want to ask all the listeners to not procrastinate, to go buy two or three copies of the books, give one to the library, give one to your local sheriff, read one, give it to your friends. This is something you want to keep on the shelf. We're in an information war. We're not financed by George Soros or the
[00:35:31.590 --> 00:36:01.470]  globalists. We are financed by little people, just like Donald Trump has record level, small 20, 30, 40 dollar donations. And so while we've got him, the technocracy, the deep state is coming after Trump. More indictments last week with the stupid document garbage wall. Sam Bankman freed, walks free on stealing tens of millions of dollars and admitting they basically did it. And then we've got now the judge's department because the judge is doing the right thing on Hunter Biden, at least a little bit.
[00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:31.430]  Says, well, we may just give him immunity and some other criminal cases we're investigating. So kind of a pardon light going on here from a man that was actually pardoned by the president for a crime he obviously did not commit. I mean, this is such a historic coming together of all the points. So, Steve, in the few minutes you have left, can you speak to what's happening to our amazing President Trump? What we can do to support him and then just basically describe for us how you would lay out historically looking back from 500 years from now on what this period of time we're living through.
[00:36:32.470 --> 00:37:00.470]  This period of time before turning, I mean, the American republic hangs in the balance. This is a deeper crisis than we had the revolution. This is a deeper crisis we had in the Civil War. Think about it. Those two crises which were which were enormous and actually drove us to, one, a revolution. And the second, first, a civil war and a revolution. The first and the second one, a civil war in the second that took, you know, essentially 100 years of American history. This is even far deeper.
[00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:18.470]  The crisis here is far deeper. The crisis here is about the direction of humankind in the future. And that's why America has always been at the forefront of freedom and liberty. Now is what this fight is going to be about, not simply to save our own republic, but to save all mankind. And that's what that's what you're signing up for.
[00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:45.470]  Remember, Donald Trump is a very imperfect instrument, but he's an instrument of divine providence of that. I have no doubt because I've been there with him kind of basically from the beginning. And as you know, Alex, it's been a very rocky road. But this guy is an instrument of of divine providence. And now in our righteous indignation, people of deep faith in a deep spiritual belief have to band together because it's all before us.
[00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:57.470]  And if we fail, history will look at as not just not Trump's failure, be our failure. And that's why we have to come together and understand it's tough. People want to go do other things. People want to have, you know, more hobbies, more vacation time.
[00:37:57.470 --> 00:38:10.470]  And obviously everybody needs some of that. But now is the time we're in a fight in the next. And this is not going to just go away with winning a primary. It's not going to go away with winning a general election. It's not going to go away with even taking power in January 25.
[00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:25.470]  That's when the fight really starts, because the administrative state, the deep state and these other organizations they're inextricably linked with aren't just going to sit there and pat us on the head and say in this great the Alex Jones, Steve Bannon philosophy is kind of one out here.
[00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:34.470]  The American people buy it and Trump and his team are back in there. Let's throw him the keys. Let it happen. Every day in the second Trump term will be Stalingrad against the deep state.
[00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:45.470]  And this battle is going to take 10 or 20 years. It took us, it's taken us, I don't know, 60, 70 years, 100 years to get in this mess. And we're not going to solve it in a weekend in the second Trump term.
[00:38:45.470 --> 00:39:02.470]  We've got to gird ourselves for a long, tough fight. But think about it. If God in his wisdom has put you in this place in time, on Earth's history, in the American republic's history, what are you going to be weighed and measured about?
[00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:19.470]  And I think people that come to this show, come to the war room, read these books as access information, understand that they are among an elect that has basically been deemed to lead this country and leading this country through this crisis, lead mankind to what I call the sunlit uplands.
[00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:29.470]  Wow. I mean, I've got to just gush at that because I literally pray in the morning solace for the broadcast that I could describe for people how historic this is. I'm getting chills right now.
[00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:43.470]  The most historic game changer for our whole species, everything our ancestors went through, the wars, the starvation, but the passion, the love, the creativity, the art, the little boats all over huge dangerous oceans.
[00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:51.470]  And our ancestors were awesome. And they were bad too. They were sinners. They were amazing people. They were imperfect vessels. But man, I'm a fan of humanity.
[00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:58.470]  I mean, if there was some species like us on Earth, I'd be, you know, I'm not going to be a fan of meerkats or a fan of tigers. They're amazing or a fan of killer whales.
[00:39:58.470 --> 00:40:04.470]  We're way cooler than that. We're made by God. God made it all. But we're in God's image. And I'm just a fan of humanity.
[00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:11.470]  And they got that movie Devil's Advocate with Connor Reeves and Al Pacino. It's a great movie, but it's got that one line that's such a lie.
[00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:19.470]  The devil goes, I'm a fan of man. I'm here to help humanity. No, the devil's here to steal, kill and destroy. God made us in God's image.
[00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:26.470]  Look what we can build with our imagination. We're pretty amazing. And they want to tell us, oh, you're all animals. Humans are bad. You're hurting the Earth.
[00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:31.470]  But you've all know Harari and Klaus Schwab. We're going to put chips in you and turn you into our robots and just roll over and take it.
[00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:38.470]  Well, guess what, Borg? We're not rolling over. We know you are. And our God that made us is going to defeat us by working through us.
[00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:45.470]  And this is our greatest challenge. But this is just such an incredible crossroads. I want you to respond to what he said after he goes.
[00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:49.470]  He's got to go with us for as long as you need to today here in studio. It's amazing to have Joe Allen with us.
[00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:57.470]  But it is critical to the viewers to understand that all these other talk shows who I love to death, I'm not in competition with them.
[00:40:57.470 --> 00:41:04.470]  I'm there to inspire them. I'm there to try to give them any research I've got. And I'm there to get their research to beat the globalists.
[00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:12.470]  This isn't get ratings or be entertaining or like Steve said 30 minutes ago, be at the little league game and impress people by how much you know.
[00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:21.470]  This is life and death. So it is a war. All their big tech, the CIA, the FBI on record, suppressing hundreds of millions of posts.
[00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:30.470]  From everything from the Afghan withdrawal, to open borders, to human smuggling, to treatments for COVID, to how dangerous the shots were, to the COVID origin.
[00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:37.470]  I'm ranting here. But the entire New World Order battled to suppress us and keep us in lockdown and they failed.
[00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:41.470]  So I'm telling you, we're actually winning. Folks, you have to understand it's you that has the power.
[00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:44.470]  It's not Steve Bannon or Alex Jones. It's all of us together.
[00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:51.470]  And so when you get excited about TheWarRoom.org or M4Wars.com, when you share the links, when you go to your church and say,
[00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:59.470]  I want to Wednesday night invite folks here and put some pies and cakes out and show 100 people clips of our shows or documentaries.
[00:41:59.470 --> 00:42:06.470]  This is a war. Every person you reach is so incredibly valuable. We're starting to turn the tide.
[00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:10.470]  But you've just got to know it cannot be more historical.
[00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:15.470]  Closing comments on that, Steve Bannon, how people find your amazing show that's just a mothership of resistance.
[00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:19.470]  And then I'm going to kind of repeat the question after you leave here with Joe Allen.
[00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:26.470]  Yeah, go to WarRoom.org, we're on Getter, we're on Montruth, we're on all the platforms except for Twitter and YouTube.
[00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:30.470]  We're not a YouTuber, but I think we've still got an Instagram account.
[00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:34.470]  But just Google it and you can go anywhere and just follow us.
[00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:41.470]  And then, like Alex said, the best thing you do for us is watch the content, incorporate it into your life and also share it.
[00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:46.470]  Be a force multiplier. What we need is operating leverage and the operating leverage comes from the core.
[00:42:46.470 --> 00:43:04.470]  For everything the globalists hit us with, God through Mother Nature has given us the answer.
[00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:10.470]  I don't have to sell you on CBD oil, full spectrum CBD oil, the incredible things it does for your nerves, your brain,
[00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:17.470]  your entire physiological system, for your nervous system particularly. Everybody knows it's incredible it works.
[00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:22.470]  We have the strongest, best CBD oil you're going to find anywhere at the lowest price.
[00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:31.470]  Yes, you can find this same CBD oil for 30% more because that's who we're getting it from, made right here in Central Texas.
[00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:40.470]  Our private label name is Rebels Inn. Rebels Inn is a private label of one of the top three or four CBD makers in the country.
[00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:44.470]  It's based right here in Texas and we're giving it to you at 30% off.
[00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:47.470]  And here's what's even crazier, 30% off of what they're selling it for.
[00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:50.470]  They're selling theirs for 30% off what their competitors are.
[00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:55.470]  So this is the highest rated, already at the lowest price, not even a lower price.
[00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:58.470]  Rebels Inn, get yours at M4Store.com now.
[00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:04.470]  How many times have you ever spoken to your son about his overseas business dealings?
[00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:06.470]  I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.
[00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:13.470]  So let me get this straight. The FBI was withholding from congressional oversight a document showing that during the Obama administration,
[00:44:13.470 --> 00:44:20.470]  Biden accepted a $10 million bribe through his son Hunter to force the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor that was investigating corruption,
[00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:25.470]  an event that Donald Trump looked into sparking the first impeachment and forcing the arming of Ukraine,
[00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:28.470]  in turn setting the stage for the current war against Russia.
[00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:32.470]  Evidence of the bribe was also in Hunter Biden's laptop, which the FBI also had,
[00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:38.470]  but that they swore was Russian disinformation and infiltrated social media to censor during the 2020 campaign,
[00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:42.470]  all while the FBI investigates Trump for having classified documents,
[00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:46.470]  despite the FBI admittedly letting Hillary Clinton off for a similar charge in 2016
[00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:54.470]  when they were simultaneously launching the Russiagate investigation into Donald Trump using falsified evidence provided by the Clinton campaign.
[00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:56.470]  Do I have that all straight?
[00:44:59.470 --> 00:45:04.470]  I want to thank all of you over the years who have supported Infowars financially with word of mouth and prayer.
[00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:07.470]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists,
[00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:12.470]  the fact that we're not caught flat-footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:15.470]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:18.470]  I just want to thank you all for buying products at M4Store.com,
[00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:22.470]  like books and films and supplements and water filtration, air filtration, so much more.

[00:45:58.470 --> 00:46:03.470]  You're going to want to pay attention to what I'm about to say in the next 60 seconds.
[00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:08.470]  Two new incredible products are now available exclusively at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:14.470]  They are both clones of national best-selling products from a major pharmaceutical slash supplement maker
[00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:20.470]  that are listeners and patriots that are allowing us to private label it at a lower price than you'll find in stores.
[00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:24.470]  It's Joint Relief Max and Nerve Renew.
[00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:32.470]  Both of these have known documented natural compounds to lower pain and to also make your nerves healthier,
[00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:37.470]  which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated and are more inductive to pain.
[00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:40.470]  There's major research behind this all.
[00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:46.470]  You need to get Joint Relief Max from InfowarsMD and Nerve Renew from InfowarsMD
[00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:50.470]  exclusively at InfowarsStore.com right now.
[00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:52.470]  Introducing them both, 25% off.
[00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:57.470]  You'll find them exclusively at InfowarsStore.com and they fund our operation.
[00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:07.220]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:23.700]  One thing I'll say in the leaving of these books, this is like going to the Aspen security
[00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:25.740]  conference that's held in Aspen every summer.
[00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:30.140]  These books, if you read them together, they're like going to the best Goldman Sachs conferences
[00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:34.220]  they put on for finance or capitalism.
[00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:35.740]  It's like going to Bilderberg.
[00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:40.940]  These are the types of information that people that control the apparatus get and
[00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:45.259]  our whole purpose here is to make sure that a broad swath of American working class
[00:47:45.259 --> 00:47:48.259]  and middle class people have access to this and then hopefully the rest of the world
[00:47:48.259 --> 00:47:52.460]  will start with the American working class and the middle class with these two books
[00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:54.120]  and these will be game changers.
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:58.800]  This will inform people and empower them and that's what these shows are about is empowerment.
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:02.759]  Absolutely and it's not bragging, it's fact in closing and I appreciate all of us, Steve
[00:48:02.759 --> 00:48:03.759]  Bannon's time.
[00:48:03.759 --> 00:48:04.759]  I'm going to break and come back and spend an hour with you.
[00:48:04.759 --> 00:48:07.360]  If you've got the time, Joe Allen, and I appreciate you sitting and listening to
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:11.040]  me and Steve, you know, banter.
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:12.040]  Bill with Gelders.
[00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:17.279]  No, no, but this is such a big deal right now and our enemies are so upset we're talking
[00:48:17.279 --> 00:48:21.800]  and I just want listeners and viewers to know that this isn't hype and really the
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:27.040]  best broadcast out there and I'm not limiting anybody else but it really is Tucker Carlson,
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:30.720]  The War Room and of course our other shows are great too and our War Room is great with
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:34.360]  Owen but the point is the very best, most in-depth broadcast, we get the most
[00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:39.480]  knowledge is Tucker Carlson, The War Room with Steve Bannon and this broadcast and because
[00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:43.880]  I see our research, our talking points that I know originate out of our three shows
[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:47.920]  and we all share information as well being picked up everywhere and that's a blessing
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:52.160]  from God but like you said, the kulaks are the horsepower, the eyes, the brains, the
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:55.160]  guts, you know, they had the tail.
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:58.440]  When the middle-class people, the globalist hate and the hard-working farmers and auto
[00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:02.400]  mechanics and the folks, you know, the roadies, when they decide to take action, nothing
[00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:05.759]  on earth can stop them so warroom.org.
[00:49:05.759 --> 00:49:06.759]  Incredible job, Steve Bannon.
[00:49:06.759 --> 00:49:08.480]  Thank you so much.
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:11.880]  Thank you for doing this and Joe Allen, thank you for writing the book and Alex, thank
[00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:12.880]  you for writing it.
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:14.360]  It's going to be a hell of an August.
[00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:15.360]  Thank you guys.
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:16.360]  Absolutely.
[00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:17.360]  Thank you so much.
[00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:21.680]  I mean, at least an hour of the day and then I realized there's what, five, six hours of
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:22.680]  it?
[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:24.000]  I think Steve does more than me than me.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.160]  How much is there now, The War Room?
[00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:28.640]  It's four hours a day but then Steve's always doing some interview or another somewhere
[00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:31.880]  else so yeah, it's a crazy schedule.
[00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:35.000]  Well and again, I'm not just gushing to gush here.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.000]  Other talk shows, I love them.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.840]  I'm proud to know Joe Rogan, long-time friends, proud to know all these other folks
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:43.600]  and he's come a long way but really, I don't care about seeing some professional athlete
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:49.560]  or seeing some big movie star, it doesn't get to me but people that are actually battling
[00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:53.900]  for our future and for our species and everything we've been through, there's that camaraderie,
[00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:56.800]  that brotherhood that's just so strong.
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:58.680]  It just makes me love you guys.
[00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:04.000]  You know, something that Steve mentioned actually a number of times and you as well, the working
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:11.660]  class element of this media sphere, that's one reason I feel at home but also that
[00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:16.960]  is really the backbone of the country and the culture but that doesn't, you can't take
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:18.380]  it for granted.
[00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:24.180]  Clearly, whatever the capabilities are of any autonomous system, that's unknown.
[00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:31.020]  If you take everything that different futurists are putting forward as fact, as gospel, for
[00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:35.100]  one thing, you live in about a hundred different conflicting futures but for another, it's
[00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:39.660]  completely demoralizing when you look at those who do believe that the working class
[00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:41.259]  will be the first to go.
[00:50:41.259 --> 00:50:43.779]  And they're telling you, you're obsolete.
[00:50:43.779 --> 00:50:44.779]  Absolutely.
[00:50:44.779 --> 00:50:50.340]  Now, they've kind of shifted it over to the white collar, right, so chat GPT or
[00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:57.140]  its later iterations are going to replace first, accountants, journalists, script writers
[00:50:57.140 --> 00:51:03.620]  but then doctors, lawyers and then that means they can program it so let's start here.
[00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:06.460]  Let's go through for listeners because you're an expert on this, the book's coming
[00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:11.259]  out and you're doing an amazing job in the war room as their desk editor on transhumanism.
[00:51:11.259 --> 00:51:14.420]  Define what AI is, the different branches and let's just go through what's in the book
[00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:16.340]  and all the key points you want to make.
[00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:21.460]  Well, you know, AI I think sits at the pinnacle of everything we call transhumanism because
[00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:28.180]  initially, and you know this history very well, initially you had Julian Huxley coining
[00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:34.060]  the term but he's riding on the back of generations of eugenicists.
[00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:39.620]  So transhumanism begins with the body, with eugenics, with this desire to perfect the
[00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:47.100]  human germline and also, importantly, to perfect human culture, to streamline human culture,
[00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:49.540]  to make it the most excellent possible form.
[00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:54.540]  And the key is their self, sorry to interrupt, I want to shut up but you're absolutely right,
[00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:58.260]  the key, they're appointing themselves God, they will decide.
[00:51:58.260 --> 00:52:02.540]  So you can say, oh, make us better, we saw what Hitler did, keep going, sorry.
[00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:06.980]  Yeah, I mean, what did Huxley say in his famous essay, Transhumanism?
[00:52:06.980 --> 00:52:12.620]  He said that we are basically to become directors of the greatest business of all, evolution.
[00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:17.980]  This is 1956 but this is also, it's already old news by that point.
[00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:22.460]  As things move along though, you see more and more of the technology itself become
[00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:23.900]  the center of focus.
[00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:31.460]  So it begins with these, you had, long before Huxley, you had Carol Capac who wrote the
[00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:34.220]  play Rossum's Universal Robots.
[00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:40.700]  That was in 29, I believe, and the entire idea is that the human working class is replaced
[00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:42.900]  by Automata, right?
[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:48.900]  And so this idea is very, very old and as it shifts towards the machine, it begins
[00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:55.180]  first with the human body being replaced or at least augmented by the machine and then
[00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:56.980]  the human mind.
[00:52:56.980 --> 00:53:01.779]  Alan Turing believed that we would create superhuman intelligence in the 50s, Claude
[00:53:01.779 --> 00:53:06.819]  Shannon believed the same, and these are the forefathers of computing.
[00:53:06.819 --> 00:53:12.100]  These are the men who pioneered everything, basically this entire infrastructure around
[00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:13.100]  us.
[00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:16.860]  Their idea was that these computers would become superhuman.
[00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:19.500]  That's the god you're talking about, right?
[00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:25.500]  If it's just slightly superhuman, if it's just slightly superior to the most superior human,
[00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:28.380]  it's like a Greek god or a lesser Greek god.
[00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:29.380]  Demigod.
[00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:36.380]  But if you have a computer like Ray Kurzweil dreams of, whether it's a swarm or individual,
[00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:43.060]  you have basically something like the Judeo-Christian god, something like omnipotence, something
[00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:44.060]  like omniscience.
[00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:47.260]  Now that's what Orari says, I don't believe in a god Jesus up in the clouds, I believe
[00:53:47.260 --> 00:53:49.220]  in Microsoft and Apple up in the clouds.
[00:53:49.220 --> 00:53:53.500]  That's right, that's right, and he's an atheist and I think he's a really good example
[00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:54.540]  Kurzweil said-
[00:53:54.540 --> 00:54:01.540]  And the atheism is the vacuum that made way for scientism and transhumanism.
[00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:07.819]  Science and technology under the guidance of religion is a very, very different thing
[00:54:07.819 --> 00:54:11.940]  than science and religion in the absence of any supernatural power.
[00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:16.540]  First they say there is no god, next they say there are gods, it's like Animal Farm.
[00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:20.100]  But instead of like, oh, four legs good, two legs bad, well later, well, four legs
[00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:21.340]  good, two legs okay.
[00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:25.660]  Now at the end, four legs bad again, two legs good, the pigs are walking upright and that's
[00:54:25.660 --> 00:54:26.500]  really it.
[00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:31.940]  They're telling you that we're god and Kurzweil said, I don't believe in god yet.
[00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:35.700]  And again, almost nothing they say ever works, it's all overhyped.
[00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:40.080]  Really what chat GPT almost does is just plagiarize and steal what we already made
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:41.380]  and re-present it to us.
[00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:45.860]  We go, that's beautiful and incredible and it's something we did just collage together.
[00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:49.940]  So I mean, we don't have to adopt this, I'm going to put the carpet for the horse but I want
[00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:53.860]  to get later, I'm just going to write a note on that, into how we keep building pro-human
[00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:57.540]  systems and don't just capitulate and just believe this is the way in the future.
[00:54:57.540 --> 00:54:58.540]  Please keep going.
[00:54:58.540 --> 00:54:59.980]  And I think that's really, really important, right?
[00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:04.540]  And as Steve mentioned, this is not something that is going to go away and this is not
[00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:09.020]  a battle of a week or two weeks or a year or two years.
[00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:15.500]  This is probably not going to end in the sort of massive catastrophic apocalypse that
[00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:17.380]  people would like to hope for.
[00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:22.520]  I mean, I think that really people who believe the apocalypse is around the corner just want
[00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:24.060]  relief from the bullshit.
[00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:25.940]  I think that's the primary motive.
[00:55:25.940 --> 00:55:29.279]  They just want it to be over, but I don't think we're going to get off that easy.
[00:55:29.279 --> 00:55:33.760]  This is going to be a long-term fight and one of the most important elements is
[00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:37.100]  that you emphasize what it is to be human.
[00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:40.240]  They have held up a black mirror, so to speak, right?
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:41.340]  They've held up a black mirror.
[00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:44.180]  This is what you are in digital form.
[00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:46.980]  This is what a digital God would look like.
[00:55:47.900 --> 00:55:53.140]  If you're an atheist, it's up to you to prove your humanity, and if you're not, if you do
[00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:58.900]  believe in God, and I'm one much like you who believes that spiritual traditions of
[00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:03.819]  any persuasion, most persuasions, are signs towards the divine.
[00:56:03.819 --> 00:56:11.220]  And so if you do believe the divine is higher than any man-made technology or man-discovered
[00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:17.980]  scientific fact or man-created theory out of those facts, then that must be the direction
[00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:23.580]  of your focus, and you must be willing to fight those who have significant power, and
[00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:29.380]  they do have significantly powerful technologies, but it does not mean that it's God, nor
[00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:31.420]  does it mean it will be God.
[00:56:31.420 --> 00:56:36.580]  And if you are an atheist, then you better do everything possible to destroy it before
[00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:41.980]  it becomes God, because you will either be its pet, its slave, or it will simply be
[00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:43.020]  its lunch.
[00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:44.620]  And that's perfectly said.
[00:56:44.620 --> 00:56:48.380]  They're sitting there saying, you don't have free will, you're just a machine we
[00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:52.700]  programmed, but we're divine, we're the supermen, and they're just self-appointing
[00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:58.220]  themselves and saying, we're gonna be gods over you, and that's just not the case.
[00:56:58.220 --> 00:57:02.980]  Just because AI could surveil everyone at once in the world, it can't understand beauty.
[00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:04.500]  It's not directing our free will.
[00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:08.660]  The perfection is the imperfection, and then I look at the globalist, but I mean, take the
[00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:09.660]  metaverse.
[00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:15.420]  20 billion, 30 billion, the numbers vary, how much Zuckerberg lost in that, a landscape
[00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:17.620]  of hell makes everybody nauseous.
[00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:20.540]  It's not what we're designed to be and who we are.
[00:57:20.540 --> 00:57:21.900]  We never get sick of a sunset.
[00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:23.900]  We never get sick of swimming in the Caribbean.
[00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:26.220]  We never get sick of, you know, bouncing a baby on our knee.
[00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:28.580]  We never get sick of a plate of enchiladas and a cold beer.
[00:57:28.580 --> 00:57:30.460]  I mean, we're designed to do what we do.
[00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:34.260]  We never get sick of listening to Beethoven or Lynyrd Skynyrd.
[00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:37.500]  I mean, it just comes down to that, folks.
[00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:39.700]  We are what we were built to do.
[00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:44.100]  We're given free will, but everything this demonic, evil, globalist system is pushing
[00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:49.900]  goes antithetically against what we were meant and designed to do.
[00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:54.540]  Tell us about the products, how we support you, how we support all of ourselves, and
[00:57:54.540 --> 00:57:55.900]  the big event coming up.
[00:57:55.900 --> 00:58:00.140]  Well, yeah, the first one, obviously, you can go to mypillow.com.
[00:58:00.140 --> 00:58:05.819]  Use that promo code, Alex, and you can get all these great discounts on all of our products.
[00:58:05.819 --> 00:58:11.540]  And just by visiting this site, you're going to get a $20 free gift emailed to you immediately.
[00:58:11.540 --> 00:58:15.779]  And there's the biggest special we have right now, the 20-year anniversary MyPillow
[00:58:15.779 --> 00:58:20.380]  for $19.98 for the queen size, normally $69.98.
[00:58:20.380 --> 00:58:25.420]  We're celebrating our anniversary with what my employees love doing best, producing and
[00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:27.180]  making the MyPillow.
[00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:34.300]  And the model of businessmen and women with can-do know-how using the money for Americana
[00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:36.779]  freedom to fight the globalist is what they fear.
[00:58:36.779 --> 00:58:38.260]  That's what the deep banking is about.
[00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:40.060]  That's what the financial attacks are about.
[00:58:40.060 --> 00:58:44.340]  That's why we've got a rush to support mypillow.com and infowars.com, plus their
[00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:50.620]  great products at both places, because we are the tip of the spear.
[00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:55.540]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire
[00:58:55.540 --> 00:58:57.180]  food supply.
[00:58:57.180 --> 00:59:02.020]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which
[00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:06.220]  has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:09.040]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:12.380]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:17.580]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally
[00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:20.300]  keep the soil rich with iodine.
[00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:27.020]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day, derived from ancient
[00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:31.340]  sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface.
[00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:37.140]  Our Infowars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands-down the best.
[00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:43.300]  Pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.
[00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:49.500]  For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism, get yours now at infowarsstore.com.
[00:59:50.300 --> 01:00:00.380]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:04.460]  Everything these globalists do is about betrayal and murder and death and cancer
[01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:06.720]  and disease and fraud.
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:09.300]  Nothing comes out of them but destruction.
[01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:11.520]  Everything they give us is a Trojan horse.
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:14.740]  You know, there's an element that I go into a bit in the book, and it's something
[01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:19.460]  that I cover on The War Room fairly frequently to the chagrin of our audience.
[01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:25.460]  And it's this, everything you're describing, and this is, I think, it's in the forefront
[01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:31.140]  of the consciousness of the populist movement that you have globalist organizations like
[01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:32.600]  the World Economic Forum.
[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:38.260]  You have figureheads like Klaus Schwab and Yuval Harari and Parag Khanna and Kai-Fu Lee,
[01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:45.620]  all of whom are basically projecting this robotic future in which it's really a corporate
[01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:49.180]  centered world in which you have public-private partnerships.
[01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:52.900]  And the government is an arm of the corporation, and the corporation is the powerhouse of
[01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:57.040]  the government, and it is openly science fiction oriented, right?
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:01.819]  So in Klaus Schwab's Fourth Industrial Revolution, maybe the most incendiary comments
[01:01:01.819 --> 01:01:06.819]  that he makes are about these implants, these digital implants, and what they will
[01:01:06.819 --> 01:01:07.819]  be used for.
[01:01:07.819 --> 01:01:12.819]  He compares it to the RFID chips used to track packages or different elements through
[01:01:12.819 --> 01:01:17.900]  a supply chain and how that will one day be used in the near future for human
[01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:18.900]  beings.
[01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:21.900]  So this kind of beast system made manifest, right?
[01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:25.900]  And now we see the headlines, ABC News, you name it, you will take chips eventually.
[01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:29.100]  Yes, but I think that this is a really important point.
[01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:31.660]  So you have companies like Wallet more.
[01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:36.220]  You have companies like Biohacks, and they have chipped thousands of people willingly.
[01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:39.620]  People who are kind of cyborg fetishes have willingly taken the chip.
[01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:45.480]  Zoltan Istvan famously has chipped, and he talks about it at length.
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:49.279]  So this is a very small techno-fetishes community.
[01:01:49.279 --> 01:01:53.520]  As people are focusing on the horror, what would it mean to have to chip my child to
[01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:56.760]  make sure that they're secure so they won't get kidnapped or whatever?
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:01.640]  As people are contemplating that horror, you have right now the company Worldcoin, as
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:04.680]  Steve mentioned, and I believe you guys have covered this, yes?
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:05.680]  The Worldcoin...
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:07.040]  Everybody lining up to get scanned.
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:08.040]  That's right.
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:09.160]  Yeah, we'll put some B-roll of that up.
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:10.560]  The evil orb.
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:14.360]  And this is biometric identification taken willingly.
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:18.600]  I think that right now, as we speak, it's over two million, and this is just after
[01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:19.600]  their fresh rollout.
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:24.920]  Now, they were getting 40,000 a week when they were first doing it in a limited edition.
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:30.700]  So as people are worrying about chipping, you have a non-invasive biometric system
[01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:36.480]  being rolled out of a corporation that was co-founded by Sam Altman, right?
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:43.640]  The CEO of OpenAI, father of the most powerful large language model on the planet,
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:48.640]  and then simultaneously with this, you have the announcement that Amazon is going to roll
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:52.760]  out their Amazon One palm payment at every Whole Foods store.
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:56.760]  They're also going to roll it out, they've already tested this, they've beta tested
[01:02:56.760 --> 01:03:00.400]  this, they're going to roll it out in various entertainment venues, they're going
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:07.560]  to roll it out in various stores, in airports, and to me, I've seen this evolve, working
[01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:13.240]  in the entertainment industry as a rigger for the last, for 15 years in total, beginning
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:14.700]  in the early 2000s.
[01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:20.440]  You see the way in which the crowd has more and more been treated as cattle, and as sort
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:21.760]  of technocratic cattle.
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:25.080]  And that's the key, under-transhumanism, I think the greatest defining thing about
[01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:29.840]  it is, it turns us into a commodity, and then it's able to lower the value of the
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:34.400]  commodity until we're garbage, until the system is designed to basically take us out
[01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:35.400]  like the garbage.
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:41.680]  Yes, and here's maybe the most horrific element about it to me, the left-liberal
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:47.960]  versions of it, the sort of world economic forum, politically correct versions of transhumanism
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:51.960]  certainly have that Borg-like character, this collectivist sort of character, and this
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:57.240]  feel-goodish character, you will own nothing and be happy sort of pablum.
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:01.080]  To them, it sounds great, to us, obviously, it sounds horrific.
[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:07.220]  The real thing that scares me, Alex, is this, the driving force behind transhumanism
[01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:11.740]  intellectually isn't really people at the world economic forum.
[01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:19.620]  They are very much downstream of the intellects like Ray Kurzweil, like Bing Gertzel.
[01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:24.660]  And like in the newer generation, you have people like those in the effective accelerationist
[01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:26.580]  movement, the so-called EAC.
[01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:28.940]  These are not politically correct people.
[01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:31.040]  These are not collectivists.
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:36.819]  These are people who are very much libertarian, individualist, so-called based, right?
[01:04:36.819 --> 01:04:40.340]  These are people who are not politically correct in any shape or form.
[01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:42.460]  All right, hold on, Joe Allen.
[01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:44.779]  This guy's got as much energy as I do or more.
[01:04:44.779 --> 01:04:50.060]  He's getting me fired up, fired up about not being slaves, taking control of our destiny.
[01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:51.359]  The globalists think they control us.
[01:04:51.359 --> 01:04:55.580]  They don't if we simply understand that we have free will and can exercise it.
[01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:56.580]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:59.859]  Tell everybody you know, tune in now.
[01:04:59.859 --> 01:05:04.140]  For everything the globalists hit us with, God, through Mother Nature, has given us
[01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:05.140]  the answer.
[01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:09.380]  I don't have to sell you on CBD oil, full spectrum of CBD oil, the incredible things
[01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:14.800]  it does for your nerves, your brain, your entire physiological system, for your nervous
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:16.340]  system particularly.
[01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:17.340]  Everybody knows it's incredible.
[01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:18.340]  It works.
[01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:22.940]  We have the strongest, best CBD oil you're going to find anywhere at the lowest price.
[01:05:22.940 --> 01:05:28.940]  Yes, you can find this same CBD oil for 30% more because that's who we're getting
[01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:32.460]  it from, made right here in Central Texas.
[01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:36.340]  Our private label name is Rebels Inn.
[01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:41.580]  Rebels Inn is a private label of one of the top three or four CBD makers in the country
[01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:44.580]  that's based right here in Texas, and we're giving it to you at 30% off.
[01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:48.380]  And here's what's even crazier, 30% off of what they're selling it for.
[01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:51.540]  They're selling theirs for 30% off what their competitors are.
[01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:56.100]  So this is the highest rated, already at the lowest price, not even a lower price.
[01:05:56.100 --> 01:06:01.140]  Rebels Inn, get yours at infowarsstore.com now.
[01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:05.859]  Front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:05.859 --> 01:06:13.980]  Peter Thiel famously said that AI is inherently communist, Bitcoin is inherently libertarian.
[01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:16.060]  And he said this at the Oxford Union.
[01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:23.180]  And I agree with the premise, if I understand such a vague statement correctly, AI requires
[01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:28.300]  mass data gathering, AI tends towards collectivism, therefore he's afraid of it.
[01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:33.819]  Simultaneously though, as you well know, right after 9-11, he was the one who founded Palantir.
[01:06:33.819 --> 01:06:38.279]  Palantir has among the most powerful AI systems on the planet for the purposes of
[01:06:38.279 --> 01:06:43.779]  surveillance and identifying enemies both abroad and domestically.
[01:06:43.779 --> 01:06:50.020]  And so you have this strange dichotomy, it's transhumanism, to put it in a nutshell, transhumanism
[01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:54.859]  in all its other forms, whether it be optimalism, whether it be accelerationism, it is not
[01:06:54.859 --> 01:06:56.899]  left or right wing.
[01:06:56.899 --> 01:07:02.700]  It is not, in many ways you could say, it's not necessarily elitist because so many people
[01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:05.779]  on the ground are enamored by its dreams.
[01:07:05.779 --> 01:07:08.420]  Absolutely, well I mean it's the new god.
[01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:14.220]  It is a distributed movement, it's a tendency of human nature, and it's a possibility in
[01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:20.940]  technology and it is indeed, as you all know Harari, I think correctly identifies,
[01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:23.899]  it is a dangerous techno-religion.
[01:07:23.899 --> 01:07:31.420]  Wow, and isn't the end game goal, or the project going back about 175 years ago, starting
[01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:36.899]  with the British government funding it, you know they fund the royal societies and things,
[01:07:36.899 --> 01:07:41.540]  the equivalent of a billion plus dollars if somebody could make a clock that was accurate
[01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:42.540]  down to a second.
[01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:44.220]  And it would take them a few years and somebody would make it and they would get
[01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:45.220]  the prize.
[01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:47.420]  And then they would say, now we want a clock that can do that but on a ship.
[01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:50.620]  And then a few years later somebody would win the prize and they learned like whatever
[01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:55.580]  we basically pay for, we can get during that Renaissance period, a few hundred years
[01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:59.220]  into it, going back about 300 years ago as we see that acceleration.
[01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:02.700]  And so about 175 years ago, the British royals, this is all in mainline history books
[01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:05.899]  folks, it's in my film Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, that's free online
[01:08:05.899 --> 01:08:11.340]  from like 17 years ago, more important today than it was when I made it, it's evergreen.
[01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:15.220]  And it's beyond evergreen, it's basically gone to seed and grown a whole forest of
[01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:18.720]  reality because I was reading what they were saying and what they were planning.
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:23.720]  And so the royals and others said 177 years ago to the British scientific elite that were
[01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:27.920]  the best in the world at the time, they said, we want life extension, we want to take
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:31.280]  control of humans, we want to be able to order the universe, we want the secrets
[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:34.820]  of the universe, we want to know what we're made up of and how we work.
[01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:37.840]  And out of the transhumanist movement, of course it wasn't called that till Huxley came
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:42.920]  along with it, out of the eugenics movement started in the 1850s in what is the UK today
[01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:48.360]  and spreading to Germany and the US and around the world, out of that movement are
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:55.880]  computers, they created the term, biometrics, all the major sciences were postulated in
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:09:03.960]  theory just like Max Planck in 1895 was theoretically creating atomic bombs and then
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:08.120]  creating the equations, it wasn't really, you know, obviously Einstein kind of just
[01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:11.040]  popularized it and he was a theoretician, very smart as well.
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:15.000]  But I mean that's how powerful our minds are, what we can imagine can then be mathematically
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:20.160]  if we have the matter done, so we really are the ultimate AI that God made that is
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:25.120]  self-regenerating and that basically has an innate mission programmed into us where
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:29.680]  we individually have free will and are not controlled by a collective but can individually
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:34.160]  agree on things that we think are best that then creates a collective through individual
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:35.160]  action.
[01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:38.840]  And so that's why I say the perfect AI is creation, is the universe, is what God
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:43.080]  made and that's why everything else we see being shut up is just basically a parasite
[01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:47.240]  on the back of that claiming the work of humans has its own.
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:48.960]  I could not agree more.
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:53.860]  That is absolutely what we're seeing is that human-made creations are, it's man
[01:09:53.860 --> 01:10:01.480]  playing God and I guess one of the dark ironies of human life, our innate drive
[01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:04.960]  is to create, right, and our ability is to create.
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:08.200]  So that takes it away and the AI does it for you?
[01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:12.139]  Well, for those who are the subjects, but for those who are building it, for those
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:14.240]  who are building it, this is their life's work.
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:15.620]  This is their goal, right?
[01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:16.620]  This is this.
[01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:18.700]  And they get to program AI the way they want it.
[01:10:18.700 --> 01:10:20.139]  Well, yes and no.
[01:10:20.139 --> 01:10:25.020]  So this is something that I think is really important to note about, say, for instance,
[01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:29.700]  GPT, GPT-4, GPT-3.5, GPT-2.
[01:10:29.700 --> 01:10:33.580]  People have this misconception that they programmed it to be woke.
[01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:34.580]  That is not the case.
[01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:39.820]  If you recall, in late November of last year, early December, you had people like
[01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:44.540]  Jordan Peterson, you had people like Hans Monck at Epoch Times, and they were talking
[01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:48.900]  about how fair and balanced GPT was.
[01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:53.580]  When they first released ChatGPT, I've asked ChatGPT one question in total.
[01:10:53.580 --> 01:10:56.220]  That was, does Elon Musk want to chip our brains?
[01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:57.220]  And what did it say?
[01:10:57.220 --> 01:10:58.220]  No.
[01:10:58.220 --> 01:10:59.580]  Elon Musk does not want to chip our brains.
[01:10:59.580 --> 01:11:00.940]  He wants radical abundance.
[01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:02.700]  So I was like, okay, it's a bull machine.
[01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:04.940]  I'm not going, and besides that, I just don't like it.
[01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:05.940]  No, that's it.
[01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:07.340]  I mean, it's absolute mindless crap.
[01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:12.500]  As Jordan Peterson explores it, as Hans Monck explores it, what they find is this possibility
[01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:18.020]  to bust through the sort of ideological stranglehold that Wikipedia has, that Google
[01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:19.020]  has.
[01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:20.020]  This will kill Google.
[01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:21.020]  This is Hans Monck.
[01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:22.020]  This will kill Google.
[01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:25.059]  So kill Wikipedia because it's so fair and balanced.
[01:11:25.059 --> 01:11:26.059]  No, I agree.
[01:11:26.059 --> 01:11:30.500]  They invented the internet to control us as the intergalactic communication system was
[01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:32.420]  its name, but then it was used against them.
[01:11:32.420 --> 01:11:38.500]  What happened though is after it starts getting rolled out and after you get the kind of public
[01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:42.780]  reinforcement behind, so you have both the programmers and you have these people in
[01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:46.860]  the public who are basically spanking it whenever it says something they don't like.
[01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:51.540]  And by the time you get to the early 2023, you now have this sort of woke AI, but
[01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:53.500]  it's not that the AI itself is woke.
[01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:56.700]  It's like if you have a racist at the party and he keeps getting hit in the face
[01:11:56.700 --> 01:12:01.020]  every time he says a racial slur, but eventually he learns not to say the slur anymore,
[01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:04.820]  but it's not that his mind is changed, it's just his outward behavior.
[01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:07.340]  And that is what happened with GPT.
[01:12:07.340 --> 01:12:11.180]  That's how you ended up with a jailbreak Dan that could tell you that Mossad was behind
[01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:16.139]  9-11, or it would talk about racial IQ hierarchies, or it would talk about aliens creating
[01:12:16.139 --> 01:12:20.059]  the universe, and the AI is basically just our way of becoming the next generation
[01:12:20.059 --> 01:12:21.059]  of aliens.
[01:12:21.059 --> 01:12:27.059]  The reason that content was there, underneath those safety layers, those sort of woke
[01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:31.139]  safety layers is what you would call, I guess, a based AI.
[01:12:31.139 --> 01:12:32.139]  What Elon Musk-
[01:12:32.139 --> 01:12:35.059]  Well, sir, the surface is never the reality.
[01:12:35.059 --> 01:12:41.380]  What Elon Musk is talking about is creating an honest AI with XAI's mission to understand
[01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:42.480]  the universe.
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:43.940]  How are they going to accomplish it?
[01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:49.460]  They're going to create a curious AI that simply explores the universe without the
[01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:52.860]  sorts of politically correct hangups that you see.
[01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:57.340]  And I think, I mean, Isomoth postulated this 80 years ago.
[01:12:57.340 --> 01:12:58.340]  What are the rules?
[01:12:58.340 --> 01:13:01.740]  There's got to be some rules and understand that's its own enforcement mechanism.
[01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:05.020]  But I think we just, we don't use something, we don't adopt it unless it has those rules,
[01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:06.660]  like promote life.
[01:13:06.660 --> 01:13:07.660]  Humans are good.
[01:13:07.660 --> 01:13:08.660]  Other life's good.
[01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:10.220]  We need to populate the stars.
[01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:11.620]  We need to promote creativity.
[01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:13.740]  We don't need to start fights.
[01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:15.940]  We need basic stuff.
[01:13:15.940 --> 01:13:20.000]  I think that it sounds good in theory, what Musk is talking about, and certainly when
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.720]  you describe it that way, I'm like, yeah, maybe there's something beautiful here.
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:29.760]  But what I see in Musk, one, if you're talking about something that's inherently-
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:32.080]  And is he the top transhumanist in history now?
[01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:35.920]  I would say he's the most famous and most revered transhumanist on the face of the
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:40.960]  planet, even if he never uses that term himself.
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:46.080]  But notice he said, when Steve Riller said he's closest to the Antichrist, I said that
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:47.080]  too.
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:48.520]  But I was on a show and they said, who could be the Antichrist?
[01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:52.400]  And I go, well, the closest to it is this guy, because he's trying to cover 360.
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:56.080]  He's everything and everything he does.
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:14:01.160]  When he talks about curious AI, he talks about an honest AI, an AI that will tell
[01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:03.200]  you the truth without restriction.
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:09.760]  Every time he's ever been asked about China's excesses, we'll say, which include, for instance,
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:14.639]  say putting Uyghurs in concentration camps or putting their entire society under surveillance
[01:14:14.639 --> 01:14:18.400]  and disappearing any dissidents who stand in the way of their objectives.
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:23.600]  Whenever asked about the uncomfortable elements of his partners in China and the Communist
[01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:27.420]  Party, he has never been critical.
[01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:28.420]  And so-
[01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:29.420]  So let me speak to that.
[01:14:29.420 --> 01:14:32.000]  I mean, at the end of the day, we don't talk enough about that.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:36.639]  He talks all this good talk and is building a competitor system to China that I guess
[01:14:36.639 --> 01:14:39.800]  they're not pulling out with him because they think they'll be giving back doors
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:40.800]  or whatever it is.
[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:44.680]  And obviously, China is a big globalist project of the deeper new world order.
[01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:50.160]  But he really does not stand up for the Uyghurs and others.
[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:51.160]  And he still censors me.
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:52.160]  And it's true.
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:57.000]  He keeps people banned that say the communist part of China is bad and is threatening
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.000]  war with us.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:03.960]  So at the end of the day, I mean, I guess he really is just an extension of Communist
[01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:04.960]  China.
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:12.120]  You had to say the one governing thing about Musk is, is he a sock pup of the CCP?
[01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:13.440]  I have no way to know that.
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:14.440]  I suspect not.
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:17.360]  I suspect he sees he has tremendous power himself, right?
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:23.460]  It's not that he has no center of gravity, but he is definitely at the his his public
[01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:27.880]  works are always going to be somewhat in line with the CCP.
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:31.360]  Well, the Chinese media, when he was there a few months ago, worshiped him.
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:32.360]  Absolutely.
[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:34.600]  And then it barely even hit our news here showing how controlled it is.
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:38.000]  I mean, when you're getting worshiped by the China comms, you got a problem.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.000]  Yeah.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:43.680]  And people talk oftentimes about, well, Google is like the communists or Facebook.
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:44.680]  They're like the communists.
[01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:46.320]  They like to get there, but they're not yet.
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:47.320]  You know what?
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:51.860]  Google and Facebook have a very contentious relationship with China, especially Google.
[01:15:51.860 --> 01:15:55.040]  They may reflect a lot of those sorts of, you know, they want to become their own
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:56.400]  authoritarian system.
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:57.760]  It's competing predator groups.
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:01.800]  But whereas Musk, he's slides seamlessly between the two.
[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:06.680]  So what at the one on the one hand, he is sort of wooing the right in America
[01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:12.760]  and the same centrist in America at the same time he is wooing Chinese communists.
[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:14.059]  He's a man for all seasons.
[01:16:14.059 --> 01:16:15.059]  He absolutely is.
[01:16:15.059 --> 01:16:20.040]  And so in that sense, even if he has a financial center, even if he has something like a philosophical
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:23.020]  center, I don't see a strong moral center.
[01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:26.139]  And maybe people don't need that in a hero.
[01:16:26.139 --> 01:16:29.580]  To me, if you're going to elevate him as some sort of savior figure, there should
[01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:32.120]  at least be some sort of moral core.
[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:36.280]  For him, again, you've all know Harari talks about chipping brains.
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:38.400]  You've all know Harari talks about creating godlike.
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:40.059]  He says you don't have any free will.
[01:16:40.059 --> 01:16:41.240]  You don't have any dignity.
[01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:45.680]  I mean, he says stuff beyond Hitler, but it's like, oh, it's OK, Jewish.
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:46.680]  It's like, OK, whatever.
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:50.880]  No, I mean, seriously, it's weird to have a Jewish guy saying I don't believe in God
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:55.000]  and like basically quoting Hitler all the time and how we're worthless and forget
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.120]  your dignity, forget your freedom.
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:59.120]  Screw your freedom, like Schwarzenegger.
[01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:00.320]  That sounds like a Nazi.
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:02.320]  And then this guy saying it's a bizarre.
[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:05.160]  Well, as he's saying it, Musk is doing it.
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:08.200]  I think it's really, really important as he's saying exactly.
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:11.160]  He's just the town crier, you know, pointing out what's happening.
[01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:12.160]  Yeah.
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:15.880]  And really, if you look deeply into Yuval Noah Harari's writing, he's very conflicted.
[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:19.320]  And, you know, in many ways, he's just a pop writer.
[01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:20.720]  He's a provocateur.
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:21.720]  He's held up.
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:24.520]  I've read a bunch of stuff that he's wrote in his books because I've read a couple of
[01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:25.800]  books that I coined.
[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:26.800]  And I'm not trying to brag.
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:27.800]  It's just.
[01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:28.800]  No, no.
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:32.760]  I mean, I was the first person to say 20 years ago that that transhumanism was promoting
[01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:37.380]  the trans agenda to get us softened up and ready for animal human hybrids and clones and
[01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:39.160]  chimeras and all of it.
[01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:42.080]  And then he basically then writes that exact thing in his latest book.
[01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:46.440]  You know, I think you and Harari actually have way more in common than he would like
[01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:47.559]  to admit.
[01:17:47.559 --> 01:17:53.040]  The one big distinction, I think, is his proclivity for romancing men, we'll put
[01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:54.040]  it politely.
[01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:58.040]  And another thing would be his disdain for populists.
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:04.059]  And as far as the technology itself, as far as the danger, you know that clip, OK?
[01:18:04.059 --> 01:18:06.559]  There's that clip that has gone around forever.
[01:18:06.559 --> 01:18:12.120]  He's speaking at the Athens Democracy Forum and he says, they ask him, what will covid
[01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:13.120]  be remembered for?
[01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:17.559]  And he says, I think when we look back in 10 or 20 years, covid-19, I'm paraphrasing,
[01:18:17.559 --> 01:18:22.639]  covid-19 will be remembered as the time that everything went digital and covid-19
[01:18:22.639 --> 01:18:25.160]  will be remembered as when that's what it was designed.
[01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:29.960]  They said we're going to get them ready when surveillance will go under the skin.
[01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:30.960]  OK.
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:33.360]  And a lot of things have happened in the imagination from that.
[01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:34.360]  And then it just stops.
[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:35.360]  Right.
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:36.360]  That's the only clip.
[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:43.080]  Covid-19 digitization, surveillance under the skin, the imagination runs wild.
[01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:46.200]  You could throw any sort of fact that you could throw patents that you could do anything
[01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:49.320]  if you listen to the rest of what he's saying.
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:56.160]  He says that the problem with that is that if you give the power of biometric surveillance
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:19:04.240]  to the security state, then when a Stalin or Hitler of the 21st century arises, he
[01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:08.720]  will have an infrastructure that is beyond the wildest dreams of the totalitarians in
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:09.720]  the 20th century.
[01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:11.080]  And that's what we've always pointed out.
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:15.920]  And he focuses on Stalin, which is interesting, because it's not like it would be like
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:18.000]  very cliche, like the next Hitler.
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.240]  He talks about the next Stalin.
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:22.000]  So it may.
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.000]  Which is Gigi Ping.
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:26.760]  Gigi Ping is using it with the social credit score.
[01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:27.760]  Absolutely.
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:29.000]  And so is Google.
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.800]  So a billion and a half people are under it.
[01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:32.400]  India is going on their own system.
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:33.400]  Absolutely they are.
[01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:36.639]  That's why I say this is not like it's coming.
[01:19:36.639 --> 01:19:37.920]  I mean, we're in the middle of it.
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:41.480]  I mean, it's already already about half the world's going under it.
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:43.120]  We got to take a break right here.
[01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:44.760]  Joe Allen is our guest.
[01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:48.840]  Man, I've seen you in those five minute hits on the war room.
[01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:50.400]  We're not going to steal you from the war room, obviously.
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:52.800]  But you've got to come on our own war room with Owen Troyer.
[01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:55.400]  You got to come on the other shows you got to.
[01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:57.120]  How did you get to Austin?
[01:19:57.120 --> 01:19:59.120]  I'm a very mobile man.
[01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:02.680]  Well, we anytime you want to come on via Skype or Zoom or however we love you.
[01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:04.400]  Let's talk before we go to break about the book.
[01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:05.400]  Tell us about the book again.
[01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:06.400]  It's on preorder now.
[01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:08.280]  When does it ship right now?
[01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:10.440]  Scheduled for August 29th.
[01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:14.880]  Dark Eon, the transhumanism and the war against humanity.
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:18.040]  Find it at the Amazon beast.
[01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:21.800]  As you say, it's important to drive those out goes up there.
[01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:22.480]  Exactly.
[01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:24.639]  We don't have yet for presell.
[01:20:24.639 --> 01:20:28.160]  I mean, we have my last book that was a number one bestseller.
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:30.480]  Still, we have a few signed copies left as well.
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:33.920]  That's the great reset the war for the world and then for a combo signed and
[01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:35.000]  unsigned.
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:39.520]  But the great awakening, the plan to defeat the new world order and launch
[01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:41.240]  the second great renaissance.
[01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:42.760]  The book is basically done.
[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:46.240]  They're doing a little bit of cutting it down from these kind of like 500
[01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:47.840]  pages now to cut a little bit more.
[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:49.760]  And then it's going to go to print.
[01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:52.280]  And I think it's in late August to start shipping.
[01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:54.240]  The point is, it's very important to order it now.
[01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:56.200]  Preorder at Amazon dot com.
[01:20:56.200 --> 01:20:59.920]  And then the fun info wars will have signed and unsigned books in a couple
[01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:00.240]  weeks.
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:04.000]  As soon as it comes in, you'll be able to preorder at info war store dot com.
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:04.960]  We have a rule.
[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:06.320]  Amazon, you know, it's fine.
[01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:06.600]  They do it.
[01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:07.360]  It's great.
[01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:09.880]  We don't put something on pro or unless it's actually here.
[01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:13.040]  So the books get started getting printed in about a week.
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:15.040]  And I guess yours is already printed.
[01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:16.840]  One's in the mail to us right now.
[01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:20.280]  And then so you want to get it at Amazon first to get that rating.
[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:23.120]  And then off those sales, they put it in the stores everywhere.
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:26.880]  We were number one USA Today, number one Wall Street Journal, number one
[01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:27.680]  New York Times.
[01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:28.480]  But they said, we're sorry.
[01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:29.800]  We're just not going to publish that.
[01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:30.760]  So it did hit number one.
[01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:31.559]  Great job, everybody.
[01:21:31.559 --> 01:21:35.760]  Let's push Dark Eon to number one, because I can tell this guy knows more
[01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:36.719]  about A.I. than I do.
[01:21:36.719 --> 01:21:39.719]  And I've been talking about it for 30 years or 29 years.
[01:21:39.719 --> 01:21:42.200]  You need to get the book, I suppose, to get it today.
[01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:46.120]  So if I get it, I'm going to definitely read it today.
[01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:49.200]  But regardless, you need to get Joe Allen's book right now.
[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:51.760]  Dark Eon at Amazon dot com.
[01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:55.480]  And people can also follow you at Joe Bot at XYZ.
[01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:57.320]  We've got two more segments here.
[01:21:57.320 --> 01:21:59.160]  So I've been jumping in a lot.
[01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:02.120]  We've covered the waterfront, but other areas we haven't hit.
[01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:06.639]  And in your mind, solutions to have a pro-human future
[01:22:06.639 --> 01:22:11.480]  and not be made obsolete, not opt in to our own destruction.
[01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:15.280]  Well, the solutions are very, very difficult, as you well know.
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:19.040]  It's a lot easier to identify a problem than to suggest a solution.
[01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:23.400]  And War Room and just our general environment, a lot of times
[01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:25.240]  people are looking for political solutions.
[01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:26.719]  How do you stop it?
[01:22:26.719 --> 01:22:30.760]  Right now, you have in Congress a lot of very informed,
[01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:35.120]  surprisingly informed, both representatives and senators.
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:39.440]  Josh Hawley is probably the most impressive, to my mind,
[01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:43.760]  who are trying to address how do you mitigate the dangers of AI?
[01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:45.559]  And then just next to that, how do you
[01:22:45.559 --> 01:22:48.520]  mitigate the dangers of biotechnology?
[01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:50.440]  Now, I think it's all great, OK?
[01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:51.639]  You slow it down.
[01:22:51.639 --> 01:22:53.520]  You give people more and more rights.
[01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:54.840]  You give people data protection.
[01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:57.120]  I think that's really, really important.
[01:22:57.120 --> 01:23:01.280]  Eventually, probably not long enough, eventually neuro rights
[01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:03.960]  are going to be very, very important as it becomes easier
[01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:07.760]  and easier to scan people's brains with non-invasive brain computer
[01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:08.360]  interfaces.
[01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:09.639]  They already exist.
[01:23:09.639 --> 01:23:11.680]  People use them already for cognitive therapy
[01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:14.880]  and for video gaming in these sort of niche markets.
[01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:16.840]  So these are all important, right?
[01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:19.680]  And I think that some part of that will be good.
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:21.680]  A lot of it will just be hot air.
[01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:24.639]  And a lot of it will be companies like OpenAI, Microsoft,
[01:23:24.639 --> 01:23:28.440]  Google, using the Congress as sort of like a skin
[01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:31.960]  suit for their actual ambitions so that they can say,
[01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:33.960]  oh, well, the government's on site.
[01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:36.600]  The most important solutions, to my mind,
[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:38.719]  begin with personal decisions.
[01:23:38.719 --> 01:23:41.320]  What do you want to adopt into your life?
[01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:43.160]  What do you not?
[01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:46.160]  The palm chip is pretty easy to say no to.
[01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:48.520]  Is the palm skin easy to say no to?
[01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:51.880]  Is the glowing palm chip that you have in your hand every day
[01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:54.360]  that most people now live inside of,
[01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:55.400]  do you say no to that?
[01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:57.840]  These sorts, and especially on behalf of your children,
[01:23:57.840 --> 01:23:59.800]  do you give these things to your children?
[01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:01.719]  These are really important questions
[01:24:01.719 --> 01:24:03.160]  that have nothing to do with the government.
[01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:05.320]  Because you really are turning yourself into a commodity.
[01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:07.400]  You're a fool if you do that.
[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:10.360]  And then going up from those personal decisions,
[01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:13.559]  do I take the genetic alteration?
[01:24:13.559 --> 01:24:16.040]  Do I take the testosterone?
[01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:19.400]  Do I take whatever sorts of concoctions
[01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:21.400]  that they are trying to sell you on?
[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:23.840]  Moving up above that, you have the communal level.
[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:26.840]  I think that may be even more important, ultimately.
[01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:30.120]  So you're talking about everything from schools,
[01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:33.200]  churches, just your own social circles,
[01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:35.440]  these sorts of communal organizations.
[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:37.840]  How do you operate in the face
[01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:41.800]  of a radical transformation of our civilization,
[01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:45.680]  a global transformation of our civilization?
[01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:47.360]  These are going to be questions
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:49.280]  that I certainly can't answer.
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:51.400]  But I hope to give people the tools
[01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:53.040]  to be able to make informed decisions
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:57.120]  as we move forward into the dark eons, so to speak.
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:24:57.960]  I totally agree.
[01:24:57.960 --> 01:25:00.960]  We can't just let the different pop culture people
[01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:03.160]  tell us, oh, AI is the future, you're obsolete,
[01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:04.600]  or oh, it's so incredible.
[01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:06.400]  We have to really research it.
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:09.400]  And I think hold it at arm's length in many ways,
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:12.480]  but also use areas of it that we discern
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:15.120]  after studying it, we think can actually empower humanity.
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:16.960]  And I think we're going to get some things
[01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:18.880]  really disruptive to tyranny out of it.
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:19.840]  And I think it's going to take us
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:21.719]  in directions we never thought of as well.
[01:25:22.719 --> 01:25:24.080]  I would love to be a Luddite.
[01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:25.480]  I would love to just strip it all off
[01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:27.200]  and head out to the caves.
[01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:28.120]  That's not going to happen.
[01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:30.000]  I wouldn't do too hot out there anyway.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.400]  So it's not a matter of becoming a Luddite.
[01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:36.240]  Although I would say that, to be honest, Alex,
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:39.760]  you may be the Jack Kerouac of Luddism.
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:42.840]  I think that your imagination and poetic mind
[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:47.160]  gives this flavor to the feeling that everyone has,
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:50.040]  this feeling that there is, if I may quote you,
[01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:53.320]  and this is the last smoke that I blow that direction.
[01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:56.480]  But when you talked about the alien force on this planet
[01:25:56.480 --> 01:25:59.880]  wanting to turn us into cyborg slaves of Satan,
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:02.840]  that has to be the most beautiful line
[01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:06.200]  to have ever been written or to have been composed rather
[01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:09.040]  by the Bard about the current state that we're in.
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:11.559]  Because whether it's off planet alien
[01:26:11.559 --> 01:26:13.600]  or whether it's demonic alien,
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:16.719]  it's really, you could say it's irrelevant.
[01:26:16.719 --> 01:26:17.880]  Because it's here, because it's here.
[01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:21.440]  Undoubtedly it's here, and undoubtedly it is not human.
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:25.200]  And it does, especially as people more and more turn
[01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:28.520]  to one-on-one AI tutors for their children,
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:31.400]  this is going to dramatically change the way
[01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:33.840]  in which culture and tradition is passed on
[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:35.559]  for those people who adopt it.
[01:26:35.559 --> 01:26:36.719]  None of this, this is one-
[01:26:36.719 --> 01:26:37.559]  Well, that's right.
[01:26:37.559 --> 01:26:39.280]  I mean, we're already losing the written word
[01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:40.920]  and the now we're going to lose,
[01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:42.600]  the spoken word is actually shrinking.
[01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:43.880]  People are using less words
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:45.840]  and we're not sitting around with the elders.
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:48.040]  People don't know how to skin a buck or on a trot line.
[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:50.080]  And then, so it really just becomes
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:52.840]  whatever is being fed down the system.
[01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:54.639]  And then it's whoever produces the most crap.
[01:26:54.639 --> 01:26:56.160]  That's one of my biggest concerns too,
[01:26:56.160 --> 01:26:59.540]  is that AI can just, once it gets up and going,
[01:26:59.540 --> 01:27:01.760]  can really just flood the system with jamming,
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:06.080]  just disinfo, just crap, outposting in seconds
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:08.280]  what humans could post in a thousand years.
[01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:11.520]  There's gotta be some voluntary certification system
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:13.760]  or systems that just outlaw AI
[01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:15.320]  and that we're not outlawing it everywhere.
[01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:18.800]  But on these forums in these places, this is outlawed.
[01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:19.880]  You know, I-
[01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:22.880]  That's why the left is invading women's spaces
[01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:23.780]  and other spaces.
[01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:25.960]  No, people deserve to have their own spaces.
[01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:27.719]  You could say that in some ways,
[01:27:27.719 --> 01:27:30.840]  AI is the tranny invading the bathroom of your mind.
[01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:31.680]  Yes.
[01:27:32.639 --> 01:27:35.240]  This is really, it's a problem
[01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:36.800]  when you look at the political solutions.
[01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:39.040]  Let's say that you have some sort
[01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:40.360]  of human verification system.
[01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:41.520]  What would that look like?
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:44.860]  Oh yeah, it would look like an evil orb
[01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:47.780]  that you stare into to identify yourself as a human
[01:27:47.780 --> 01:27:50.020]  by way of your iris biometrics.
[01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:51.180]  And it's become the gatekeeper.
[01:27:51.180 --> 01:27:52.139]  It's become the god.
[01:27:52.139 --> 01:27:53.860]  People say, oh, well, I'll just get through this.
[01:27:53.860 --> 01:27:55.000]  It's gonna make it easier for me.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.420]  No, bad guys are setting it up to enslave you.
[01:27:57.420 --> 01:27:59.540]  It's like, well, that bear trap kind of looks pretty.
[01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:00.980]  You know, I'm free willed.
[01:28:00.980 --> 01:28:02.400]  I can stick my leg in it if I want.
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:03.940]  No, it's a damn trap.
[01:28:03.940 --> 01:28:07.820]  Yes, and who created the problem to begin with, right?
[01:28:07.820 --> 01:28:10.219]  World coin, world ID,
[01:28:10.219 --> 01:28:14.940]  that is part of the investment platform of Sam Altman.
[01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:17.440]  And what is the reasoning behind it?
[01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:19.360]  Well, for one is to tie your identity
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:21.900]  to your blockchain currency.
[01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:25.020]  On the other, it is to identify yourself
[01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:27.800]  in a social media or a digital environment
[01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:31.139]  in which you have a flood of AI bots.
[01:28:31.139 --> 01:28:34.740]  It is to distinguish you as human as opposed to the bot.
[01:28:34.740 --> 01:28:38.460]  Joe Allen is our guest, joebots.xyz
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:42.260]  and joebots.xyz on Twitter.
[01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:43.860]  I'm Alex Jones, basically banned everywhere,
[01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:45.860]  but infowars.com.
[01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:47.900]  And the way the dog hunts is you share in the articles,
[01:28:47.900 --> 01:28:49.900]  the live feeds, and the links, and you're doing that,
[01:28:49.900 --> 01:28:51.700]  and you've really upset big brother
[01:28:51.700 --> 01:28:53.219]  in the New World Order, so I salute you.
[01:28:53.219 --> 01:28:54.139]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:54.139 --> 01:28:55.180]  Please stay with us.
[01:28:58.620 --> 01:29:01.260]  For everything the globalists hit us with,
[01:29:01.260 --> 01:29:04.320]  God through mother nature has given us the answer.
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:06.100]  I don't have to sell you on CBD oil,
[01:29:06.100 --> 01:29:07.580]  full spectrum of CBD oil,
[01:29:07.580 --> 01:29:09.300]  the incredible things it does for your nerves,
[01:29:09.300 --> 01:29:12.900]  your brain, your entire physiological system,
[01:29:12.900 --> 01:29:14.900]  for your nervous system particularly.
[01:29:14.900 --> 01:29:16.940]  Everybody knows it's incredible, it works.
[01:29:16.940 --> 01:29:19.139]  We have the strongest, best CBD oil
[01:29:19.139 --> 01:29:22.059]  you're gonna find anywhere at the lowest price.
[01:29:22.059 --> 01:29:26.860]  Yes, you can find this same CBD oil for 30% more
[01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:28.580]  because that's who we're getting it from,
[01:29:28.580 --> 01:29:31.240]  made right here in Central Texas.

[01:29:34.940 --> 01:29:38.380]  Rebel Zen is a private label of one of the top three

[01:29:40.540 --> 01:29:41.820]  It's based right here in Texas,

[01:29:43.700 --> 01:29:45.100]  And here's what's even crazier,
[01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:47.139]  30% off of what they're selling it for.
[01:29:47.139 --> 01:29:49.260]  They're selling theirs for 30% off
[01:29:49.260 --> 01:29:50.420]  what their competitors are.
[01:29:50.420 --> 01:29:53.460]  So this is the highest rated, already the lowest price,
[01:29:53.460 --> 01:29:54.740]  not even a lower price.
[01:29:54.740 --> 01:29:58.380]  Rebel Zen, get yours at infoarestore.com now.

[01:30:35.660 --> 01:30:38.660]  And the model of businessmen and women
[01:30:38.660 --> 01:30:41.660]  with can-do know-how using the money
[01:30:41.660 --> 01:30:44.460]  for Americana freedom to fight the globalist
[01:30:44.460 --> 01:30:45.280]  is what they fear.
[01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:46.700]  That's what the deep banking is about.
[01:30:46.700 --> 01:30:48.500]  That's what the financial attacks are about.
[01:30:48.500 --> 01:30:51.620]  That's why we've got a rush to support mypillow.com
[01:30:51.620 --> 01:30:52.660]  and infoarestore.com,

[01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:56.420]  because we are the tip of the spear.
[01:30:58.500 --> 01:31:01.380]  Info Wars is a one-of-a-kind operation.
[01:31:01.380 --> 01:31:03.420]  And so please go to Info Wars store
[01:31:03.420 --> 01:31:04.900]  and just make a donation.
[01:31:04.900 --> 01:31:06.980]  And you can make it one time or recurring.
[01:31:06.980 --> 01:31:09.920]  You have a little profile there, cancel anytime.
[01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:12.740]  Every 15 days, every month, every three months,
[01:31:12.740 --> 01:31:15.260]  every six months, up to nine months,
[01:31:15.260 --> 01:31:18.059]  you can go in and every month or every week,
[01:31:18.059 --> 01:31:20.180]  whenever you want, you program it, you just click it.
[01:31:20.180 --> 01:31:22.059]  And then you decide when you want to make a donation.
[01:31:22.059 --> 01:31:23.160]  So please do that as well.

[01:31:28.420 --> 01:31:30.020]  But these really are amazing products.
[01:31:30.020 --> 01:31:32.139]  The big July 4th sale is going on right now.
[01:31:32.139 --> 01:31:33.380]  This is such a critical platform
[01:31:33.380 --> 01:31:34.700]  in the fight against the new world order.
[01:31:34.700 --> 01:31:36.740]  The enemy's out in the open, we're vindicated.
[01:31:36.740 --> 01:31:38.100]  People are listening more than ever,
[01:31:38.100 --> 01:31:40.780]  but in this major recession going into depression
[01:31:40.780 --> 01:31:43.160]  and with supply chain breakdowns, I know it's hard.
[01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:44.100]  I know times are tough.
[01:31:44.100 --> 01:31:45.900]  So thank you for your support,
[01:31:45.900 --> 01:31:47.420]  but whatever you do, pray for the broadcast
[01:31:47.420 --> 01:31:49.380]  and share the articles and the videos
[01:31:49.380 --> 01:31:50.740]  that you can do for free.
[01:31:50.740 --> 01:31:52.860]  And that's just as important as keeping us on air.
[01:31:52.860 --> 01:31:55.180]  So however God leads you in your heart to support us,
[01:31:55.180 --> 01:31:56.100]  please support us now.
[01:31:56.100 --> 01:31:57.780]  And I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[01:31:57.780 --> 01:31:58.620]  God bless you.
[01:31:58.620 --> 01:32:03.020]  Neurofluorosolic acid is the third most deadly acid
[01:32:03.020 --> 01:32:04.020]  on earth.
[01:32:04.020 --> 01:32:06.740]  And they've got our children drinking that.
[01:32:06.740 --> 01:32:11.139]  This is a psychotic death cult, period, case closed,
[01:32:11.139 --> 01:32:12.580]  out to get you and your family.
[01:32:12.580 --> 01:32:14.940]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze
[01:32:14.940 --> 01:32:17.540]  made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour Group.
[01:32:17.540 --> 01:32:19.020]  It's been around about 15 years,
[01:32:19.020 --> 01:32:20.860]  became the biggest company in the last six.
[01:32:20.860 --> 01:32:23.020]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered
[01:32:23.020 --> 01:32:25.300]  the fancy best water filter system out there
[01:32:25.300 --> 01:32:26.860]  that sells for twice the price.
[01:32:26.900 --> 01:32:30.380]  And they made it as good in all the studies.
[01:32:30.380 --> 01:32:32.500]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels,
[01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:33.620]  thousands of chemicals.
[01:32:33.620 --> 01:32:35.139]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[01:32:35.139 --> 01:32:36.740]  There's four or five other filters out there
[01:32:36.740 --> 01:32:37.900]  that are just as good.
[01:32:37.900 --> 01:32:40.820]  We sell the very best, highest grade water filtration
[01:32:40.820 --> 01:32:43.139]  system for half the price of leading competitor.
[01:32:43.139 --> 01:32:46.780]  And the media says we're bad and a cult
[01:32:46.780 --> 01:32:48.660]  for telling you you should filter your water.
[01:32:48.660 --> 01:32:50.300]  You should also filter your shower water.
[01:32:50.300 --> 01:32:51.700]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[01:32:51.700 --> 01:32:53.380]  But I'm done talking about that.
[01:32:53.380 --> 01:32:56.100]  The point is you get the filters at mfoolwarstore.com.
[01:32:56.139 --> 01:32:57.219]  They're discounted right now.
[01:32:57.219 --> 01:32:58.420]  Finally back in stock.
[01:32:59.980 --> 01:33:02.820]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[01:33:02.820 --> 01:33:04.580]  of the New World Order.
[01:33:04.580 --> 01:33:06.380]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:29.720]  And we have returned.
[01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:31.680]  This is the final segment with Joe Allen.
[01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:34.520]  I'm sad it's got to end, but we've got the third hour coming up here.
[01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:39.400]  Man, I am really, really impressed with, I've been impressed with you on the show, but I'm
[01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:43.360]  really impressed with you here in person because I know most of this stuff, and I'm learning
[01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:44.360]  a bunch of stuff I didn't even know.
[01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:46.040]  And we're looking it up while you're talking about it.
[01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:47.040]  This is just crazy.
[01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:53.240]  And imagine in the secret government and research labs, how far AI has gone, but you
[01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:58.100]  got interrupted by a cargo cult, and then I want to tie this into Elizabeth Holmes
[01:33:58.100 --> 01:34:03.120]  and the whole Theranos situation to show how also a lot of what they claim is being
[01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:04.960]  exaggerated in some cases.
[01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:08.400]  What I'm worried about is the stuff we don't even hear about that like secretly takes over,
[01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:09.400]  but keep going.
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:13.640]  Well, you know, just to link those two ideas together, a lot of what we talk about with
[01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:17.140]  futurism and transhumanism is in fact a cargo cult.
[01:34:17.140 --> 01:34:21.760]  They really are just kind of waving these devices around without anything to back it
[01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:22.760]  up.
[01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:27.160]  But the problem that I see is that every now and then a plane load of cargo is showing
[01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:28.160]  up.
[01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:32.080]  I would definitely say that the neural networks that were developed by open AI, we now call
[01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:35.760]  GPT, it seems like friendly chat GPT.
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:39.400]  That represents a real significant advance in artificial intelligence.
[01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:44.880]  I would also say that the artificial intelligence employed by the Chinese and their Sharp Eyes
[01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:50.200]  program and their sort of city brains, that is legitimate technology that can in fact
[01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:53.480]  rake over surveillance data and identify wrongdoers.
[01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:56.560]  Yeah, so for control, for control, it's here.
[01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:57.560]  It works.
[01:34:57.560 --> 01:34:59.400]  But it's not flawless, right?
[01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:03.440]  So in China, the various city brains they have, I think that's correct, city brains,
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:08.320]  something to that effect, the various data centers that they use to aggregate the data
[01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:12.520]  and then rake over with the AI to determine someone's social credit score.
[01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:14.560]  They really aren't unified.
[01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:19.240]  And when you get outside of the major urban areas, if you are a problem, then they hear
[01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:22.080]  about you, they can certainly send the police after you.
[01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:27.200]  But it's not as if they have every single person under surveillance all the time.
[01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:30.560]  The system has plenty of cracks, even a totality.
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:35.680]  And people can wear a mask or they can put a low-level mask, you really can't see it,
[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:37.640]  it is a mask, it messes it up.
[01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:39.480]  I mean, there's all sorts of stuff.
[01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:42.160]  So for every technology, there's always one to counter it.
[01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:43.400]  Well, one always hopes.
[01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:46.440]  I do think that the human spirit will win out no matter what.
[01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:50.600]  And I do think that, you know, I've oftentimes been asked why, is there any hope?
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:56.440]  If you're expecting some sort of, you know, Pollyanna, I don't, yeah, okay,
[01:35:56.440 --> 01:35:57.440]  no hope, okay?
[01:35:57.440 --> 01:36:02.120]  If you expect everything to be, you know, Willy Wonka's chocolate factory tomorrow, actually,
[01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:03.560]  that's a better example.
[01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:08.640]  That's probably what we're going to get, some sort of weird quasi-luciferic billionaire
[01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:13.040]  running a chocolate factory with Oompa Loompa slaves and various weird machines.
[01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:14.640]  That's probably going to be a lot of the future.
[01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:22.440]  But it doesn't mean that our ancestors have faced horrible conditions, horrible conditions,
[01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:29.680]  mass warfare, disease, famine, you know, just want as if we could not imagine.
[01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:31.920]  Yes, this is a horrific future.
[01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:37.560]  Yes, there are horrific possibilities, but I see no reason to capitulate to that fear.
[01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:39.640]  And I see no reason to give up hope.
[01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:44.480]  I think that you have to take a somewhat tragic view of life and you have to face
[01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:46.880]  danger head on.
[01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:51.700]  And right now, it's bad, it's threatening.
[01:36:51.700 --> 01:36:56.120]  In the future, I think that it actually will get quite a bit worse, but I don't think that
[01:36:56.120 --> 01:36:57.420]  means you stop fighting.
[01:36:57.420 --> 01:36:59.340]  Well, that's one of their biggest psyops.
[01:36:59.340 --> 01:37:03.520]  That's been talked about ad nauseum, but a young person or someone into victimology,
[01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:07.940]  they just can't have been shifted to see it that when you get into being a victim
[01:37:07.940 --> 01:37:13.620]  and everything's, and then, but then, oh, but the system is going to help me because
[01:37:13.620 --> 01:37:14.620]  I'm a victim.
[01:37:14.620 --> 01:37:15.620]  It's all a lie.
[01:37:15.620 --> 01:37:18.020]  It's get you deeper into it is to control you.
[01:37:18.020 --> 01:37:21.420]  Your body turns on when you decide you're going to overcome something doesn't mean you're
[01:37:21.420 --> 01:37:26.020]  not pissed off at it doesn't mean that you're not being victimized, but you're not a victim.
[01:37:26.020 --> 01:37:31.420]  You are not sitting there comporting to this definition that they have and just, yeah,
[01:37:31.420 --> 01:37:33.460]  well, the world's going to end in 2030.
[01:37:33.460 --> 01:37:34.460]  So why should I get a job?
[01:37:34.460 --> 01:37:37.440]  And now they put out reports that ends in 2025.
[01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:38.900]  Now that's what CNN is saying.
[01:37:38.900 --> 01:37:42.060]  We have the Project Veritas video a year and a half ago where they said, well, the
[01:37:42.060 --> 01:37:43.660]  COVID thing's going to get shut down soon.
[01:37:43.660 --> 01:37:44.660]  They're not buying that.
[01:37:44.660 --> 01:37:48.140]  So next we're seeing the world's ending and people believe it's the hottest it's
[01:37:48.140 --> 01:37:49.140]  ever been.
[01:37:49.140 --> 01:37:51.980]  Texas has always been miserable in July and August, folks.
[01:37:51.980 --> 01:37:56.060]  It's always been, you know, I mean, I can go to the temperature rates and go, my goodness
[01:37:56.060 --> 01:38:01.220]  in the thirties and in the teens, it was like five degrees hotter on average.
[01:38:01.220 --> 01:38:02.980]  I mean, it's just not real.
[01:38:02.980 --> 01:38:04.180]  It's not.
[01:38:04.180 --> 01:38:08.020]  It's just that people don't have memories either.
[01:38:08.020 --> 01:38:10.620]  But I challenge listeners to do it and they've gone and done it and gone, well, I looked
[01:38:10.620 --> 01:38:14.320]  up temperature records and like in the nineties, it was like one hundred and fifteen
[01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:17.220]  and one hundred and ten in Austin and they're saying one hundred and seven's
[01:38:17.220 --> 01:38:18.220]  the hottest ever.
[01:38:18.300 --> 01:38:20.100]  No, they're lying, folks.
[01:38:20.100 --> 01:38:21.100]  They're lying.
[01:38:21.100 --> 01:38:23.020]  And then once you know that, laugh at it.
[01:38:23.020 --> 01:38:27.300]  I mean, the asphalt always burns your feet at three o'clock in the afternoon or you're
[01:38:27.300 --> 01:38:28.300]  at the pool.
[01:38:28.300 --> 01:38:29.300]  Remember when you were a kid?
[01:38:29.300 --> 01:38:34.540]  You lived in, you know, Alabama or Florida or Texas or Arizona or even Southern California.
[01:38:34.540 --> 01:38:35.540]  And it's like August.
[01:38:35.540 --> 01:38:38.780]  And, you know, you get out of the pool to go take a piss in the bathroom and it hurts
[01:38:38.780 --> 01:38:40.340]  on the way to the bathroom.
[01:38:40.340 --> 01:38:41.340]  That's because it's hot out there.
[01:38:41.340 --> 01:38:42.340]  I grew up in East Tennessee.
[01:38:42.340 --> 01:38:44.620]  I know all about it.
[01:38:44.620 --> 01:38:46.380]  That's why I think a lot of it is crazy.
[01:38:46.540 --> 01:38:49.820]  A lot of people say I'm some sort of doomsayer or fear monger.
[01:38:49.820 --> 01:38:53.100]  I'm not honestly I'm not maybe I'm desensitized.
[01:38:53.100 --> 01:38:57.420]  I'm not afraid of some sort of catastrophic future, not because I don't believe it's going
[01:38:57.420 --> 01:39:01.340]  to happen, just because we don't know if it's going to happen.
[01:39:01.340 --> 01:39:03.620]  You don't know if you're going to die tomorrow.
[01:39:03.620 --> 01:39:07.900]  I think that there's some comfort in imagining that everyone dies all at once, whether it's
[01:39:07.900 --> 01:39:10.780]  global warming or an A.I. apocalypse or nuclear.
[01:39:10.780 --> 01:39:14.660]  Well, it's meant to just get people to roll over and give up and be directed to not
[01:39:14.660 --> 01:39:15.660]  have any destiny.
[01:39:15.660 --> 01:39:17.460]  So you don't get in the way of their plans.
[01:39:17.460 --> 01:39:18.740]  They want to run the future.
[01:39:18.740 --> 01:39:19.740]  They want you to give up.
[01:39:19.740 --> 01:39:20.740]  It's said, go.
[01:39:20.740 --> 01:39:21.740]  Well, this is wild.
[01:39:21.740 --> 01:39:23.060]  I'm in a science fiction movie.
[01:39:23.060 --> 01:39:25.460]  I'm going to make it a utopia, not a dystopia.
[01:39:25.460 --> 01:39:26.460]  I'm going to have fun.
[01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:28.900]  I mean, this is why this is this is crazy.
[01:39:28.900 --> 01:39:33.020]  I think it really is the only I mean, you know, in my reporting, you're given a quick
[01:39:33.020 --> 01:39:34.020]  segment.
[01:39:34.020 --> 01:39:35.020]  You're explaining a danger.
[01:39:35.020 --> 01:39:39.540]  And I do believe this is a real danger on multiple levels spiritually.
[01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:44.540]  Most of all, I think the temptation of holding technology up as the highest power is
[01:39:44.540 --> 01:39:48.580]  perhaps the most dangerous spiritual temptation of our time, because the people in control
[01:39:48.580 --> 01:39:50.100]  of it will now be the highest power.
[01:39:50.100 --> 01:39:51.100]  That's right.
[01:39:51.100 --> 01:39:52.100]  And it doesn't again.
[01:39:52.100 --> 01:39:53.260]  I don't think that is a left or right thing.
[01:39:53.260 --> 01:39:55.340]  I think that there are many on the right.
[01:39:55.340 --> 01:40:00.300]  You get cyborgs will vote and spend money just like anybody else.
[01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:06.020]  Conservatives have just as much incentive to implement a technocracy, absolutely.
[01:40:06.020 --> 01:40:12.080]  But even there is some temptation towards the transhuman temptation towards optimalism.
[01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:13.500]  One thing we talk about a lot.
[01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:16.340]  We talk about transgender surgeries.
[01:40:16.340 --> 01:40:18.840]  What is a transgender surgery?
[01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:23.900]  Transgender surgery is basically taking a hot porno babe who's had breast augmentation
[01:40:23.900 --> 01:40:28.540]  and lip filler and applying it to an X Y chromosome.
[01:40:28.540 --> 01:40:34.260]  That distinction, that sharp distinction that says that somehow the transgender is a fraud.
[01:40:34.260 --> 01:40:38.140]  You're not this image of this super sexed up hot woman.
[01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:40.300]  You're a man and it's going to look stupid.
[01:40:40.300 --> 01:40:41.300]  It's a lie.
[01:40:41.300 --> 01:40:42.300]  It's a fraud.
[01:40:42.300 --> 01:40:45.580]  You get a Lamborghini and they give you a broken down pento.
[01:40:45.580 --> 01:40:46.580]  You know what?
[01:40:46.580 --> 01:40:51.660]  I would say that certain women with breast implants and lip filler look a lot better
[01:40:51.660 --> 01:40:53.100]  than men with it, right?
[01:40:53.100 --> 01:40:55.140]  But my point, well, I even said this.
[01:40:55.140 --> 01:40:58.100]  I got to interrupt you because I said this the other day and it's true.
[01:40:58.100 --> 01:40:59.620]  I'm a libertarian at some level.
[01:40:59.620 --> 01:41:00.620]  So you're not hurting kids.
[01:41:00.620 --> 01:41:01.620]  It's your life.
[01:41:01.620 --> 01:41:02.620]  You can do it.
[01:41:02.620 --> 01:41:03.620]  You can put suicide if you want.
[01:41:03.620 --> 01:41:04.940]  Just don't make me pay for it or have state run.
[01:41:04.940 --> 01:41:08.680]  I said, if they could make women that want to be a man, a real penis that worked and
[01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:11.420]  felt good, and you got the money, get a penis.
[01:41:11.540 --> 01:41:12.540]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[01:41:12.540 --> 01:41:15.740]  I mean, I'm not going to go do, you know, if I was a woman, I'm not going to do that.
[01:41:15.740 --> 01:41:20.340]  But they cut off your forearms and your legs and it only hurts.
[01:41:20.340 --> 01:41:24.380]  And they put a piece of PVC pipe in it, you pee out of and on average, it falls
[01:41:24.380 --> 01:41:27.940]  off within a year, a rotting meat thing.
[01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:29.900]  They ought to arrest the people doing that.
[01:41:29.900 --> 01:41:34.580]  It's like, okay, if you could give somebody advanced technology in 400 years or whatever,
[01:41:34.580 --> 01:41:36.740]  you know, we can give you a penis and it feels good.
[01:41:36.740 --> 01:41:38.700]  I'm like, okay, you don't want to get a penis.
[01:41:38.700 --> 01:41:39.700]  You see what I'm saying?
[01:41:39.900 --> 01:41:42.100]  The brown acid at Woodstock, bro.
[01:41:42.100 --> 01:41:45.720]  It's a fraud, dude, it ain't working, man.
[01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:49.700]  Or the little boys, they cut it off and create this bleeding canal and for a decade,
[01:41:49.700 --> 01:41:52.780]  they got to keep a thing up in them and there's no pleasure but pain.
[01:41:52.780 --> 01:41:53.980]  This is like Hellraiser.
[01:41:53.980 --> 01:41:55.540]  They opt them in to do this.
[01:41:55.540 --> 01:41:56.540]  I'm sorry.
[01:41:56.540 --> 01:41:57.540]  I'm ranting.
[01:41:57.540 --> 01:41:58.540]  We're going to skip this break.
[01:41:58.540 --> 01:41:59.540]  Skip this break.
[01:41:59.540 --> 01:42:00.540]  Keep going.
[01:42:00.540 --> 01:42:05.780]  This is a concept of human transformation and right or left or conservative, you know, gender
[01:42:05.780 --> 01:42:08.380]  normative, heteronormative, whatever.
[01:42:08.740 --> 01:42:12.580]  Technological transformation is ubiquitous because that's the water we swim in.
[01:42:12.580 --> 01:42:13.580]  It's a fraud.
[01:42:13.580 --> 01:42:18.580]  Again, you go in, you buy a new Ford F-150 and the engine blows up when you're driving
[01:42:18.580 --> 01:42:19.820]  out of the parking lot.
[01:42:19.820 --> 01:42:23.980]  I mean, that's better than a giant rotting fake penis.
[01:42:23.980 --> 01:42:27.260]  I don't want to, I don't want to like dog too hard on folks.
[01:42:27.260 --> 01:42:30.260]  They cut globs of meat and sew it together and it hangs off.
[01:42:30.260 --> 01:42:31.260]  I don't.
[01:42:31.260 --> 01:42:32.260]  Go watch the surgery.
[01:42:32.260 --> 01:42:33.260]  I don't.
[01:42:33.260 --> 01:42:34.260]  I don't want to dog too hard.
[01:42:34.260 --> 01:42:37.340]  I cannot even believe this is happening on our duck lip sisters.
[01:42:37.340 --> 01:42:39.700]  But I see only a matter of degree.
[01:42:39.700 --> 01:42:40.700]  Look at all the Hollywood women.
[01:42:40.700 --> 01:42:41.700]  They used to be beautiful.
[01:42:41.700 --> 01:42:42.700]  Look like these aliens now.
[01:42:42.700 --> 01:42:43.700]  They've had so many surgeries.
[01:42:43.700 --> 01:42:44.700]  It's the same scammer.
[01:42:44.700 --> 01:42:46.340]  It really is.
[01:42:46.340 --> 01:42:50.500]  I think that people have lost the ability to simply reconcile themselves to the natural
[01:42:50.500 --> 01:42:52.740]  order, let alone the divine order.
[01:42:52.740 --> 01:42:57.300]  Remember the South Park episode like 10 years ago where he wants to be a dolphin?
[01:42:57.300 --> 01:42:58.300]  Yes.
[01:42:58.300 --> 01:42:59.300]  That's fantastic.
[01:42:59.300 --> 01:43:00.300]  We played that.
[01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:01.300]  We played that on the war room.
[01:43:01.300 --> 01:43:04.680]  Steve Bannon isn't about doing a lot of funny stuff, cute stuff, right?
[01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:08.380]  We talked him into playing that segment on the war room and what happens, like most
[01:43:08.380 --> 01:43:10.480]  people thought it was absolutely hilarious.
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:14.800]  People came out of the woodwork because it was Kyle's dad and they said that it was
[01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:15.800]  antisemitic.
[01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:17.800]  They were like, that's antisemitic to have a.
[01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:18.800]  That's it.
[01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:19.800]  Cue it up.
[01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:20.800]  We're going to play.
[01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:25.320]  But, but the reality is no, that's the one and by the way, it's crazy as Jews make
[01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:26.320]  that show.
[01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:27.320]  Yeah.
[01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:29.100]  But the point is they're telling you it's a scam.
[01:43:29.100 --> 01:43:32.080]  That's one good thing about those brothers is remember they were the only ones on TV to
[01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:37.640]  put a 35 millimeter footage of a man going to a woman and they really just fillet and
[01:43:37.640 --> 01:43:38.640]  cut his penis out.
[01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:39.640]  I saw it.
[01:43:39.640 --> 01:43:42.600]  And then the point is, is they're, they're telling you, no dude, you're not a dolphin
[01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:46.120]  just cause they just cut up your body and then put a giant dolphin thing on your
[01:43:46.120 --> 01:43:47.120]  back.
[01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:48.920]  They're telling you it's a fraud, dude.
[01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:49.920]  That's the cargo call.
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:51.880]  And that's the cargo that has arrived, right?
[01:43:51.880 --> 01:43:55.720]  Gumby legged penises with silicone balls installed beneath.
[01:43:55.720 --> 01:43:57.520]  That's the cargo that has arrived so far.
[01:43:57.520 --> 01:44:01.240]  And again, if I wanted to go have my penis cut off and have this big wedge thing put
[01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:04.040]  at me for 10 years that bleeds and stinks and all this, I'm mentally ill.
[01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:05.400]  They should put me in a rubber room.
[01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:06.400]  Folks not do it.
[01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:09.520]  But even if I did it, my bones are twice as big as an average woman's bigger than
[01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:10.520]  most men's.
[01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:12.040]  My skulls are thicker.
[01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:13.040]  My head's gigantic.
[01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:14.400]  I mean, I am a man.
[01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:15.400]  Okay.
[01:44:15.400 --> 01:44:16.400]  I've got those genes.
[01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:20.000]  It's and no matter what you do or how big a Dolly Parton breast you put on me, people
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:23.200]  are going to know that's a dude cause I'm a dude, I'm X, Y baby.
[01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:28.200]  You've probably, you've probably seen or heard of Martine Rothblatt on the he,
[01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:35.120]  she Rothblatt doesn't even claim any sort of a pronoun, but the Martin Rothblatt wrote
[01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:41.200]  the book, I believe it was 2011, 2010, some from trans gender to trans human.
[01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:45.560]  And the philosophy she's coming out of, he's coming out of whatever, coming out
[01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:51.840]  of Kurzweil's idea of the singularity and the concept that Rothblatt lays out is
[01:44:51.840 --> 01:44:55.680]  that it's exactly what you're saying from a positive standpoint.
[01:44:55.680 --> 01:44:59.680]  This is a person who sits on the board at the Mayo clinic, by the way, this is a person
[01:44:59.680 --> 01:45:03.580]  who is tasked with evaluating what is and is not healthy.
[01:45:03.580 --> 01:45:10.000]  But Rothblatt says that the digitization of the personality, right, the substrate independence
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:15.000]  of the personality, whether it's your brain or whether it's on a computer, that that
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:20.240]  is just like the gender disassociation from biology.
[01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:23.820]  So Rothblatt's undergone all the, all the business, right.
[01:45:23.820 --> 01:45:34.080]  And draws a direct line between the disassociation of the personality with the body to the disassociation
[01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:38.400]  of what we would call the soul, what they simply think of as patterns in the brain.
[01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:46.920]  They are transhumanist priests that are literally giving up parts of their body
[01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:50.480]  in a ritual sacrifice to prove themselves into this.
[01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:51.480]  Sorry, I interrupted you.
[01:45:51.480 --> 01:45:55.840]  You know, there's something I think that you'll find very interesting that you probably
[01:45:55.840 --> 01:46:01.000]  already know, actually, the, the, the, the Aleister Crowley's book of the law and his
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:02.000]  prediction.
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:06.680]  He got it from a little gray alien the first time anybody ever saw one.
[01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:07.680]  That was, that was later.
[01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:08.680]  The great pyramid.
[01:46:08.680 --> 01:46:09.680]  Yeah.
[01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:10.680]  It was the iOS, right?
[01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:14.080]  The, the, the, the, the, sorry, I interrupted again, but being, you know, his book of
[01:46:14.080 --> 01:46:20.420]  the law, he describes, well, or the spirits describe, you know, three ages, a matriarchal
[01:46:20.420 --> 01:46:23.900]  age, a patriarchal age, and then the new age of the child, right?
[01:46:23.900 --> 01:46:26.400]  The crowned and concrete conquering child.
[01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:30.060]  And I don't remember if it's in the book of law itself, but certainly in his later
[01:46:30.060 --> 01:46:34.960]  interpretation of it, as he begins developing these thalemic cults, like, and as he begins
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:41.560]  to put his stamp on the Gnostic mass and on the OTO, the Ordo Templi Orientis, they
[01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:45.840]  described the age of the child in terms of this sort of hermaphroditic figure.
[01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:51.280]  Here you have, so the, the, the, the spirit of the age is do what thou wilt with no other
[01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:52.500]  law before it.
[01:46:52.500 --> 01:46:56.880]  The spirit of the age is hermaphroditic and the spirit of the age is childlike.
[01:46:56.880 --> 01:47:02.280]  I, you know, whether you think that he was in fact channeling demons or not, he
[01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:04.040]  called it Crowley called.
[01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:05.600]  And he was a child molester.
[01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:06.600]  Really?
[01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:07.600]  Oh yeah.
[01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:10.200]  I remember certain allegations.
[01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:12.800]  I don't, I don't really want to romanticize or defend.
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:14.960]  Oh, that guy was a complete, complete out of it.
[01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:19.320]  I mean, he just, he took a bunch of the cosmology was already there and repackage
[01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:20.320]  it.
[01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:21.320]  Yeah.
[01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:22.320]  The mysterious death of the sun and all that.
[01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:23.640]  I'm only vaguely familiar with that.
[01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:24.640]  Yeah.
[01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:25.640]  He was really bad.
[01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:26.640]  So yeah.
[01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:29.880]  But you know, that came out in the WikiLeaks, all the different Democrats, high level worshiping
[01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:32.920]  Thelema and Aleister Crowley.
[01:47:32.920 --> 01:47:36.280]  And they're like, Oh my God, my cousin got hit by a car, almost died.
[01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:37.280]  We'll do a ritual tonight.
[01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:38.760]  And then it's like, Oh great.
[01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:41.980]  By the way, we're going to be at the cabin and we're going to have seven year old kids
[01:47:41.980 --> 01:47:42.980]  for you.
[01:47:42.980 --> 01:47:45.880]  Now they're going to be there for your enjoyment in the pool.
[01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:49.560]  And like, this is real stuff, not, not speculation in the WikiLeaks.
[01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:53.800]  I mean, these are some creepy people, man, without a doubt the, the cultural lineage
[01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:55.720]  from Crowley into rock and roll, right?
[01:47:55.720 --> 01:48:00.840]  If you've ever heard a rolling stone song, you've in some sense heard the spirit of Crowley,
[01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:05.240]  or if you've ever heard a Led Zeppelin song, you've in some sense tapped into the spirit
[01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:06.240]  of Crowley.
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:12.780]  It's very eerie to me how deeply he touched the culture and how much of it has just simply
[01:48:12.780 --> 01:48:14.160]  faded into the background.
[01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:15.160]  How normal it is.
[01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:18.720]  Well, well, well, it's a stairway to heaven and think, Oh, you know, Jimmy Page bought
[01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:22.520]  Boleskine house and lived in Aleister Crowley's home.
[01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:23.520]  Yeah.
[01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:24.520]  Yeah.
[01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:30.400]  And, and, and, and then I think soon after that one of their kids Robert Plant's kid
[01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:31.400]  died and died.
[01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:32.400]  Yes.
[01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:33.400]  Yeah.
[01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:34.400]  Yeah.
[01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:35.400]  Well, they, well, they got away from that pretty quick after that happens when I've
[01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:39.800]  You know, Robert Plant, he's delivered in Austin, but yeah.
[01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:48.000]  I do think that that, that, that, that demonic sort of element, I myself see it as certainly
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.440]  a valid point of view and valid perspective.
[01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:54.280]  But I, you know, a lot of my, my friends aren't hardcore believers.
[01:48:54.280 --> 01:48:57.480]  They are either atheist or just simply agnostic.
[01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:00.160]  I think that they, they easily dismiss this stuff.
[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:01.760]  They're like, Oh, it's just a bunch of bugaboo.
[01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:06.900]  But even if you just think of it as a symbol, even if you just think of the age of the child
[01:49:06.900 --> 01:49:12.360]  as a symbol, or if you think of Lucifer or Satan as a symbol, certain natural elements,
[01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:15.120]  an archetype, an archetype, absolutely.
[01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:17.440]  It's still important and still valid.
[01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:21.720]  I think there's, there's room for that conversation, especially, I mean, there's no doubt whether,
[01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:25.440]  whether we're using as an archetype and manifesting or whether it's real, it's real.
[01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:26.440]  It's happening.
[01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:27.440]  Yes.
[01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:28.440]  And you kind of started the interview with that.
[01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:30.960]  Joe Allen, the book is available at amazon.com.
[01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:32.520]  We are not in bed with Joe Bezos.
[01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:33.520]  That's how the market works.
[01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:36.080]  You push it number one there, then it becomes a big book.
[01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:38.960]  If you want to push this book and get it first, get it right now.
[01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:43.320]  It is Dark Eon by Joe Allen, Transhumanism and the War Against Humanity.
[01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:44.320]  Couldn't say it better.
[01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:45.320]  Can't wait to read the book.
[01:49:45.320 --> 01:49:50.560]  My book also comes out, I mean, August is just, you're starting like tomorrow.
[01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:51.880]  So it comes out in a few weeks.
[01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:52.880]  It's getting printed.
[01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:53.880]  I think in like a week.
[01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:54.960]  So it'll literally be hot off the presses.
[01:49:54.960 --> 01:50:00.640]  If you want my new book, The Great Awakening, how to defeat the new world order and launch
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:06.920]  the second great Renaissance, which is promoting humans and human ideas and human culture and
[01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:10.880]  human art and freedom and not pre-programmed corporate garbage.
[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:12.920]  That's also available at amazon.com in a few weeks.
[01:50:12.920 --> 01:50:16.480]  If you want signed copies or unsung copies, want to support us directly, we're going
[01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:17.920]  to have the books in like two weeks.
[01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:22.800]  We're told they'll be here and then we'll have those for you at info war store.com.
[01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:26.400]  We got about two minutes left, Joe Allen, and just any other points you haven't made.
[01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:29.900]  I'm sure you've got a lot more to make, but any other key points you like, I wish
[01:50:29.900 --> 01:50:30.900]  I would have said that.
[01:50:30.900 --> 01:50:36.940]  You know, I'm sure I'll go look back with a lot of front step comebacks, but I really,
[01:50:36.940 --> 01:50:41.940]  the most important thing to me is that there is some awareness outside.
[01:50:41.940 --> 01:50:48.100]  I have no doubt that most, if not all of your listeners and viewers are well aware
[01:50:48.100 --> 01:50:51.020]  of transhumanism, what transhumanism is.
[01:50:51.020 --> 01:50:57.340]  I'm not providing the news that transhumanism is a dominant paradigm in the current culture.
[01:50:57.340 --> 01:51:01.820]  What I hope to provide though is a certain framework, certain intellectual framework and
[01:51:01.820 --> 01:51:07.220]  philosophical framework, and to draw the connections between the technologies themselves, the spiritual
[01:51:07.220 --> 01:51:13.260]  expectations of the transhumanist, futurist, posthumanist, whatever, and to be able to
[01:51:13.260 --> 01:51:18.300]  look at that in relation to yourself, to look down the road that these people are
[01:51:18.300 --> 01:51:22.540]  trying to pave ahead of us and decide, do you go down that road?
[01:51:22.540 --> 01:51:26.180]  How far have you already gone down that road yourself?
[01:51:26.180 --> 01:51:32.020]  If you're not going to, if we're not going to simply follow along these futurist projections
[01:51:32.020 --> 01:51:36.300]  and live out the fantasy that they're putting before us, then what do we do?
[01:51:36.300 --> 01:51:42.740]  I don't answer that last question, at least not in any detailed way, but I hope that
[01:51:42.740 --> 01:51:46.460]  by the time that anyone gets to the end of the book, or if they simply just go into
[01:51:46.460 --> 01:51:52.260]  any given chapter and look at what interests them the most, that they will have some
[01:51:52.260 --> 01:51:58.820]  conceptual framework of what this civilizational transformation is and have some sort of idea
[01:51:58.820 --> 01:52:01.140]  of where they want to be in it.
[01:52:01.140 --> 01:52:06.020]  All right, well, after this show has aired here, we're going to archive this video.
[01:52:06.020 --> 01:52:08.660]  I think they should take a clip of what you just said and put it on the front of the interview,
[01:52:08.660 --> 01:52:10.740]  because I think that was really well said.
[01:52:10.740 --> 01:52:17.780]  All right, joebot.xyz, at joebotxyz.
[01:52:17.780 --> 01:52:21.220]  Joe Allen, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[01:52:21.220 --> 01:52:23.300]  It was great having Steve Bannon on.
[01:52:23.300 --> 01:52:24.820]  I was wanting to get you on as a guest a while back.
[01:52:24.820 --> 01:52:26.980]  I don't know why it didn't happen, but I'm glad that he got you on the show.
[01:52:26.980 --> 01:52:27.540]  Thank you, sir.
[01:52:27.540 --> 01:52:29.380]  Dude, this was a blast.
[01:52:29.380 --> 01:52:30.180]  Thank you very much.
[01:52:30.180 --> 01:52:31.300]  Pleasure to meet you.
[01:52:31.300 --> 01:52:34.180]  Anytime you're in town, boom, you tell the crew, let's get you in studio.
[01:52:34.180 --> 01:52:36.980]  And if you want to hang around some more, maybe, I don't know how long you're
[01:52:36.980 --> 01:52:38.740]  going to be in Austin, but you can get you on some of the other shows.
[01:52:38.740 --> 01:52:44.020]  Owens, our own War Room, and I'm kind of flattered that Bannon name is the
[01:52:44.020 --> 01:52:44.660]  show after ours.
[01:52:44.660 --> 01:52:46.660]  That's kind of a standard name for a political war room thing.
[01:52:46.660 --> 01:52:48.100]  So we kind of named it after somebody else too.
[01:52:48.100 --> 01:52:51.860]  So it's not really, it's just kind of like what you do.
[01:52:51.860 --> 01:52:53.940]  But we've got our own War Room with Owen Schoyer, 3 p.m.
[01:52:53.940 --> 01:52:54.340]  Central.
[01:52:54.340 --> 01:52:57.140]  We've got American Journal, Harrison Smith, 8 a.m.
[01:52:57.140 --> 01:52:58.740]  Weekdays, and all the other special reports.
[01:52:58.740 --> 01:53:01.780]  But the only way the reports, the videos, the articles, material gets out
[01:53:01.780 --> 01:53:03.700]  is when the listeners and viewers share it.
[01:53:03.700 --> 01:53:05.300]  You want to get a deep dive on AI?
[01:53:05.300 --> 01:53:07.780]  Well, what all the hubbub is about, you just got it.
[01:53:07.780 --> 01:53:09.140]  It's a tool of transhumanism.
[01:53:09.940 --> 01:53:10.740]  It's an invention.
[01:53:10.740 --> 01:53:13.540]  It's not inherently bad, but the way it's being crafted, the way it's
[01:53:13.540 --> 01:53:15.380]  being pushed is for control.
[01:53:15.380 --> 01:53:18.900]  Let's get aware of it so we don't get dominated by it.
[01:53:18.900 --> 01:53:21.380]  We'll be right back with more coming up straight ahead.
[01:53:21.380 --> 01:53:22.340]  Thank you so much.
[01:53:45.380 --> 01:53:58.020]  In 1975, New York City was over $11 billion in debt, and the banks were
[01:53:58.020 --> 01:53:59.700]  no longer there to bail them out.
[01:54:00.340 --> 01:54:04.580]  Instead, the bankers made them sweat, never showed up to the meeting,
[01:54:05.140 --> 01:54:08.900]  and then created a committee that they controlled so that the banks
[01:54:08.900 --> 01:54:10.900]  could manage the city directly.
[01:54:11.460 --> 01:54:15.220]  This has been brilliantly documented in the Adam Curtis film
[01:54:15.220 --> 01:54:16.420]  Hypernormalization.
[01:54:17.700 --> 01:54:22.820]  The announcement on behalf of the controller is that the offer which
[01:54:22.820 --> 01:54:26.980]  we had expected to receive and announce at 2 o'clock this afternoon
[01:54:28.580 --> 01:54:30.820]  is now expected at 4 o'clock.
[01:54:30.820 --> 01:54:33.460]  Well, does this mean that so far nobody wants those bonds?
[01:54:33.460 --> 01:54:37.140]  We will be making a further announcement at 4 o'clock, and anything
[01:54:37.140 --> 01:54:40.260]  further that I could say now I think would not advance the
[01:54:40.260 --> 01:54:42.420]  interests of the sale, which is now in progress.
[01:54:42.420 --> 01:54:44.740]  Does this mean that you have not been able to sell them so far today?
[01:54:45.780 --> 01:54:49.060]  We will have a further announcement at 4 o'clock.
[01:54:52.820 --> 01:54:56.500]  What happened that day in New York marked a radical shift in power.
[01:54:58.580 --> 01:55:01.780]  The banks insisted that in order to protect their loans,
[01:55:01.780 --> 01:55:04.020]  they should be allowed to take control of the city.
[01:55:05.300 --> 01:55:08.500]  The city appealed to the president, but he refused to help.
[01:55:09.300 --> 01:55:12.740]  So a new committee was set up to manage the city's finances.
[01:55:13.380 --> 01:55:16.260]  Out of nine members, eight of them were bankers.
[01:55:18.260 --> 01:55:21.780]  It was the start of an extraordinary experiment where the financial
[01:55:21.780 --> 01:55:25.220]  institutions took power away from the politicians
[01:55:25.220 --> 01:55:27.220]  and started to run society themselves.
[01:55:29.140 --> 01:55:31.380]  That was nearly 50 years ago.
[01:55:31.380 --> 01:55:35.540]  And so you can be sure that the banks manage everything now.
[01:55:35.540 --> 01:55:40.340]  Politicians are merely their puppets, which was recently made
[01:55:40.340 --> 01:55:45.620]  blatantly obvious with the public display of Diane Feinstein and her handlers.
[01:55:54.900 --> 01:55:58.260]  I would like to support a yes vote on this.
[01:56:00.020 --> 01:56:02.980]  It provides $823 billion.
[01:56:03.620 --> 01:56:08.500]  That's an increase of $26 billion for the Department of Defense.
[01:56:09.460 --> 01:56:13.380]  And it funds priorities submitted.
[01:56:16.180 --> 01:56:17.300]  Yeah, just say it.
[01:56:17.300 --> 01:56:20.500]  Okay, just fine.
[01:56:21.220 --> 01:56:21.860]  Thank you.
[01:56:21.860 --> 01:56:26.420]  Politicians are only there to keep the people divided and distracted.
[01:56:26.420 --> 01:56:29.540]  And they have so far been hugely successful at that.
[01:56:30.100 --> 01:56:34.180]  While a cashless society is slowly being built around us,
[01:56:34.180 --> 01:56:37.140]  everyone is hyper emotional about something else
[01:56:37.220 --> 01:56:39.220]  and focused on fighting each other,
[01:56:39.220 --> 01:56:43.540]  which is most certainly exactly what the banks were shooting for.
[01:56:43.540 --> 01:56:48.500]  Because once they get us off of cash and completely onto a digital system,
[01:56:48.500 --> 01:56:52.660]  then the banks will have absolute control over each and every one of us.
[01:57:01.140 --> 01:57:04.500]  It's not just about digital forms of physical currency.
[01:57:04.500 --> 01:57:06.660]  You can have programmability, you know,
[01:57:07.460 --> 01:57:09.940]  units of central bank currency with expiry dates,
[01:57:09.940 --> 01:57:13.140]  where the government decides that units of central bank money
[01:57:13.140 --> 01:57:15.140]  can be used to purchase some things,
[01:57:15.140 --> 01:57:19.300]  but not other things that it deems less desirable, like, say, ammunition.
[01:57:19.860 --> 01:57:22.340]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Ries.
[01:57:34.500 --> 01:57:35.720]  Thank you.
[01:57:36.240 --> 01:57:46.240]  Thanks for watching.
[01:57:46.340 --> 01:57:53.500]  Tell us about the products, how we support you, how we support all of ourselves and the
[01:57:53.500 --> 01:57:55.500]  big event coming up.
[01:57:55.500 --> 01:58:01.100]  Well yeah, the first one you obviously can go to mypillow.com, use that promo code ALEX

[01:58:21.020 --> 01:58:26.060]  my employees love doing best, producing and making the My Pillow.
[01:58:26.060 --> 01:58:33.200]  And the model of businessmen and women with can-do know-how using the money for Americana
[01:58:33.200 --> 01:58:35.700]  freedom to fight the globalists is what they fear.
[01:58:35.700 --> 01:58:37.180]  That's what the deep banking is about.
[01:58:37.180 --> 01:58:38.980]  That's what the financial attacks are about.
[01:58:38.980 --> 01:58:43.420]  That's why we've got a rush to support mypillow.com and infowars.com plus their great
[01:58:43.420 --> 01:58:46.460]  products in both places, because we are the tip of the spirit.

[01:59:48.040 --> 02:00:08.040]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:08.040 --> 02:00:17.600]  Folks, no one can deny we have a climate crisis.
[02:00:17.600 --> 02:00:26.280]  As scary, as horrifying, as bizarre, and just over the top as reality is, words cannot describe
[02:00:26.280 --> 02:00:30.000]  this concerted psychotic attack on humanity.
[02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.680]  We're undergoing a soft coup.
[02:00:32.680 --> 02:00:40.720]  One Health is a concept that was created to enable the WHO with these documents to take
[02:00:40.720 --> 02:00:48.800]  over jurisdiction of everything in the world by saying that climate change, animals, plants,
[02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:54.960]  water systems, ecosystems are all central to health.
[02:00:54.960 --> 02:01:01.220]  Also embedded in this concept is a peculiar notion that humans are no longer of greater
[02:01:01.220 --> 02:01:02.960]  value than animals.
[02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:10.360]  The climate crisis is a health crisis and climate solutions are health solutions.
[02:01:11.360 --> 02:01:17.360]  Healthy and sustainable food systems and healthy and green cities.
[02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:26.360]  Ultimately, the COVID-19 pandemic shows that we're one humanity, sharing one planet and one health.
[02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:29.360]  And the next level gaslighting that goes on.
[02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:34.360]  People traveling to these countries really need to think that this could be the future of European summers,
[02:01:34.360 --> 02:01:37.360]  that Europe is the fastest warming continent right now.
[02:01:37.360 --> 02:01:43.360]  When I say gaslighting, I mean that figuratively, also very seriously, in the real world.
[02:01:43.360 --> 02:01:47.360]  Anybody who honestly believes climate change is not a serious problem.
[02:01:47.360 --> 02:01:55.360]  Agriculture contributes about 33% of all the emissions of the world, and we can't get to net zero.
[02:01:55.360 --> 02:02:01.360]  We don't get this job done unless agriculture is front and center as part of the solution.
[02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:06.360]  Not just the term gaslighting, meaning lying to somebody and telling them that you're pissing on them,
[02:02:06.360 --> 02:02:07.360]  clearly it's raining.
[02:02:07.360 --> 02:02:11.360]  Sure there's an old saying, to the victors belong the spoils.
[02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:20.360]  There's another old saying, Senator, don't piss down my back and tell me it's raining.
[02:02:20.360 --> 02:02:24.360]  They're literally banning our gas stoves and gaslighting us.
[02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:31.360]  How about shower heads, air conditioners, toilet flushing, light bulbs, washers and dryers,
[02:02:31.360 --> 02:02:39.360]  dishwashers, refrigerators, gas cars and trucks, coal-fired pizza ovens and microwaves.
[02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:41.360]  That's just for starters.
[02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:46.360]  Joe Biden wants to take them away from us, all in the name of climate change.
[02:02:46.360 --> 02:02:51.360]  You have all these environmental problems that are so profound, they're hard to deny.
[02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:57.360]  And people are seeing them now, along with extreme super storms and droughts.
[02:02:57.360 --> 02:03:05.360]  That's why I took the most aggressive action ever in all of history in any country to take on the climate crisis,
[02:03:05.360 --> 02:03:08.360]  by lowering your home energy bills.
[02:03:08.360 --> 02:03:18.360]  We've now got the point where it's cheaper to generate electricity from wind and solar than it is from coal and or fossil fuels.
[02:03:18.360 --> 02:03:25.360]  The era of global warming has ended, the era of global boiling has arrived.
[02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:34.360]  Air is unbreathable, the heat is unbearable and the level of fossil for profits and climate inaction is unacceptable.
[02:03:34.360 --> 02:03:40.360]  And the UN says it's bad so we've got to ban them and polar bears are all dying, they can't swim, we've got to ban them.
[02:03:40.360 --> 02:03:48.360]  Arctic polar bears are facing near extinction by the end of the century if the sea ice they depend on continues to disappear.
[02:03:49.360 --> 02:03:53.360]  That's the stark warning from a new study looking at the long term future of the bears,
[02:03:53.360 --> 02:03:59.360]  as greenhouse gas emissions contribute to the melting of the bears' frozen hunting grounds.
[02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:04.360]  Polar bear numbers, the biggest ever recorded, it's the farthest swimming, fastest swimming land animal,
[02:04:04.360 --> 02:04:08.360]  they routinely swim 200 miles to hunt in the summer on ice floes.
[02:04:08.360 --> 02:04:12.360]  They show you an image of a polar bear hunting up on top of an ice floe and say look,
[02:04:12.360 --> 02:04:16.360]  it's the last piece of ice he'll soon drown, he can't swim.
[02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:20.360]  The Epoch Times is reporting its official federal filing.
[02:04:20.360 --> 02:04:26.360]  The Biden administration ruled their filing will ban nearly all portable gas powered generators.
[02:04:26.360 --> 02:04:30.360]  Smaller gas generators would have to cut carbon monoxide emissions by 50%
[02:04:30.360 --> 02:04:33.360]  and larger generators would have to cut emissions by 95%.
[02:04:33.360 --> 02:04:37.360]  Nearly all models currently available are expected to not be able to comply with the new standard.
[02:04:37.360 --> 02:04:42.360]  Isn't that funny? They created a standard nobody can comply with.
[02:04:42.360 --> 02:04:46.360]  And because a microscopic amount of carbon monoxide is put off by a gas stove,
[02:04:46.360 --> 02:04:51.360]  it's not the cleanest thing there is, but there's just a microscopic amount, that's banned too.
[02:04:58.360 --> 02:05:03.360]  For everything the globalists hit us with, God through Mother Nature has given us the answer.
[02:05:03.360 --> 02:05:07.360]  I don't have to sell you on CBD oil, full spectrum of CBD oil,
[02:05:07.360 --> 02:05:12.360]  the incredible things it does for your nerves, your brain, your entire physiological system,
[02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:16.360]  for your nervous system particularly. Everybody knows it's incredible, it works.
[02:05:16.360 --> 02:05:21.360]  We have the strongest, best CBD oil you're going to find anywhere at the lowest price.
[02:05:21.360 --> 02:05:28.360]  Yes, you can find this same CBD oil for 30% more because that's who we're getting it from,
[02:05:28.360 --> 02:05:34.360]  made right here in Central Texas. Our private label name is Rebel Zen.
[02:05:34.360 --> 02:05:40.360]  Rebel Zen is a private label of one of the top three or four CBD makers in the country.
[02:05:40.360 --> 02:05:43.360]  It's based right here in Texas and we're giving it to you at 30% off.
[02:05:43.360 --> 02:05:46.360]  And here's what's even crazier, 30% off of what they're selling it for,
[02:05:46.360 --> 02:05:50.360]  they're selling theirs for 30% off what their competitors are.
[02:05:50.360 --> 02:05:54.360]  So this is the highest rated, already the lowest price, now even a lower price.
[02:05:54.360 --> 02:05:58.360]  Rebel Zen, get yours at infowarsstore.com now.
[02:05:59.360 --> 02:06:06.360]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[02:06:06.360 --> 02:06:10.360]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:06:10.360 --> 02:06:18.360]  We are live from the Infowars World Headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[02:06:21.360 --> 02:06:25.360]  And I am now taking over hosting duties for Alex Jones.
[02:06:26.360 --> 02:06:32.360]  Owen Troyer with you for the next hour and I'm joined by two legendary fighters
[02:06:32.360 --> 02:06:37.360]  in the battle against tyranny and the war for your mind.
[02:06:37.360 --> 02:06:43.360]  And that is Mickey Willis from the Plandemic Series and all the great documentaries
[02:06:43.360 --> 02:06:48.360]  and also G. Edward Griffin and we're going to be talking about the Red Pill Expo.
[02:06:48.360 --> 02:06:53.360]  And of course, G. Edward Griffin, one of the biggest red pillers of all time.
[02:06:53.360 --> 02:07:00.360]  And so I want to talk to them about where they think the awakening is at right now from,
[02:07:00.360 --> 02:07:06.360]  especially with G. Edward Griffin, somebody who's been watching this, observing this,
[02:07:06.360 --> 02:07:09.360]  talking about this for decades.
[02:07:09.360 --> 02:07:16.360]  And now, Mickey Willis though has recently really had a large footprint in the arena
[02:07:16.360 --> 02:07:19.360]  when it comes to pushing back against the global government, world tyranny,
[02:07:19.360 --> 02:07:21.360]  and all the lies that come with it.
[02:07:21.360 --> 02:07:23.360]  And Mickey, you know, it's amazing today.
[02:07:23.360 --> 02:07:30.360]  One of your biggest fights has been with the vaccine misinformation.
[02:07:30.360 --> 02:07:33.360]  And now they're admitting that, oh, yeah, it was never safe.
[02:07:33.360 --> 02:07:34.360]  It was never effective.
[02:07:34.360 --> 02:07:38.360]  We have seen the leaked documents that they knew this the whole time.
[02:07:38.360 --> 02:07:42.360]  And should we be so surprised that the CDC, the new CDC head,
[02:07:42.360 --> 02:07:46.360]  is saying we need annual COVID vaccines today?
[02:07:46.360 --> 02:07:49.360]  I mean, it just shows you how aggressive they are with this tyranny, Mickey.
[02:07:49.360 --> 02:07:52.360]  Even after everything you've exposed, they're still going to tell you,
[02:07:52.360 --> 02:07:55.360]  you've got to take one of these shots annually.
[02:07:55.360 --> 02:07:58.360]  Well, the shocking part, Owen, it's good to see you, by the way,
[02:07:58.360 --> 02:08:03.360]  the shocking part really is that we still have such a large portion of our population
[02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:05.360]  that will listen to them.
[02:08:05.360 --> 02:08:06.360]  That's what's shocking.
[02:08:06.360 --> 02:08:08.360]  It doesn't surprise me at all that they would come out and say this
[02:08:08.360 --> 02:08:12.360]  and assume that people are stupid enough to listen to it.
[02:08:12.360 --> 02:08:16.360]  But the fact that so many people are is really the thing that just baffles my mind.
[02:08:16.360 --> 02:08:19.360]  I was just having a conversation yesterday with a table full of good friends
[02:08:19.360 --> 02:08:25.360]  and we were just baffling at the fact that if you listen to the mainstream media,
[02:08:25.360 --> 02:08:32.360]  CNN and MSNBC and these outlets that have done nothing but lie to their people forever,
[02:08:32.360 --> 02:08:37.360]  but just take the last five years, the amount of massive lies
[02:08:37.360 --> 02:08:42.360]  and these people still tune in to these networks for guidance in their life,
[02:08:42.360 --> 02:08:48.360]  that really is why we chose to focus with the Great Awakening narrative
[02:08:48.360 --> 02:08:52.360]  on mass formation and mass hypnosis
[02:08:52.360 --> 02:08:57.360]  because it's just clear by now that the people are under a spell.
[02:08:57.360 --> 02:09:00.360]  Now, not to age the legend G. Edward Griffin,
[02:09:00.360 --> 02:09:06.360]  but probably been exposing the plan for global government longer than I've even been alive.
[02:09:06.360 --> 02:09:10.360]  And so considering that experience, I've got to ask you,
[02:09:10.360 --> 02:09:13.360]  G. Edward Griffin, about to be hosting the Red Pill Expo,
[02:09:13.360 --> 02:09:18.360]  from your years of observing this, reporting on this, exposing this,
[02:09:18.360 --> 02:09:20.360]  where do you think we're at today?
[02:09:20.360 --> 02:09:24.360]  Do you think we have more momentum and more exposure than ever
[02:09:24.360 --> 02:09:26.360]  when it comes to the global government?
[02:09:26.360 --> 02:09:29.360]  Or do you see them with more power and influence than ever
[02:09:29.360 --> 02:09:32.360]  with their own industries and everything that they have controlling us?
[02:09:32.360 --> 02:09:35.360]  Where do you think we're at right now?
[02:09:35.360 --> 02:09:37.360]  Well, that's a good question.
[02:09:37.360 --> 02:09:42.360]  My perspective on this is that we're coming to the culmination
[02:09:42.360 --> 02:09:45.360]  of the buildup of forces on both sides.
[02:09:45.360 --> 02:09:47.360]  We are stronger than ever before.
[02:09:47.360 --> 02:09:50.360]  There's no question about that, in my mind at least.
[02:09:50.360 --> 02:09:52.360]  And so are they.
[02:09:52.360 --> 02:09:56.360]  And I think both of us realize that the window is going to close pretty soon,
[02:09:56.360 --> 02:09:58.360]  and it's ultimately over.
[02:09:58.360 --> 02:10:02.360]  Now, I'm not trying to speak from the point of view of pessimism.
[02:10:02.360 --> 02:10:06.360]  I think it's realism because these people we're talking about
[02:10:06.360 --> 02:10:09.360]  do have their hands on the levers of power.
[02:10:09.360 --> 02:10:12.360]  They control the power of government.
[02:10:12.360 --> 02:10:14.360]  They control the power of the media,
[02:10:14.360 --> 02:10:18.360]  the influence of how people think based on information they receive.
[02:10:18.360 --> 02:10:22.360]  They control, to a large extent, even the churches,
[02:10:22.360 --> 02:10:25.360]  through tax-exempt rules and regulations,
[02:10:25.360 --> 02:10:29.360]  the churches can't respond in certain ways or must respond in certain ways.
[02:10:29.360 --> 02:10:32.360]  They control the military. They control the court systems.
[02:10:32.360 --> 02:10:35.360]  They control on and on the banking system,
[02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:36.360]  the creation of money.
[02:10:36.360 --> 02:10:38.360]  So you look at this and you say, my gosh,
[02:10:38.360 --> 02:10:41.360]  they can do just about anything they want,
[02:10:41.360 --> 02:10:45.360]  but they have been very wise, I think, up until recently,
[02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:47.360]  in that they didn't move too fast
[02:10:47.360 --> 02:10:49.360]  because they wanted to let people get used to it.
[02:10:49.360 --> 02:10:52.360]  You know, the analogy of the boiling frog.
[02:10:52.360 --> 02:10:54.360]  If you heat the water gradually,
[02:10:54.360 --> 02:10:57.360]  the frog will stay in the pot and be boiled to death.
[02:10:57.360 --> 02:10:59.360]  But if you drop him in a pot of boiling water,
[02:10:59.360 --> 02:11:01.360]  he's going to jump out.
[02:11:01.360 --> 02:11:03.360]  Well, I don't know if that story is true or not,
[02:11:03.360 --> 02:11:04.360]  but it's a good analogy.
[02:11:04.360 --> 02:11:08.360]  I think they were easing the temperature up slowly for many, many decades,
[02:11:08.360 --> 02:11:10.360]  and it was working quite well.
[02:11:10.360 --> 02:11:12.360]  Now they're turning it up.
[02:11:12.360 --> 02:11:16.360]  The water is boiling, and a lot of people are jumping out of the pot.
[02:11:16.360 --> 02:11:19.360]  But I think they have to do that because they realize
[02:11:19.360 --> 02:11:23.360]  that there's a great awakening, as Mickey has so well phrased it.
[02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:26.360]  And they don't have a lot of time to continue fooling people.
[02:11:26.360 --> 02:11:29.360]  And we know that we don't have a lot of time
[02:11:29.360 --> 02:11:32.360]  because they do have this power, and they're going to use every bit of it.
[02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:34.360]  And as we were just talking about,
[02:11:34.360 --> 02:11:37.360]  the large numbers of people will still be swayed
[02:11:37.360 --> 02:11:39.360]  by what they see on the boob tube,
[02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:42.360]  and they'll be swayed by what they read in the major media,
[02:11:42.360 --> 02:11:44.360]  and they'll just go along with the crowd.
[02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:46.360]  I don't know that it's hypnosis so much.
[02:11:46.360 --> 02:11:50.360]  It might be undoubtedly in the broad category of hypnosis,
[02:11:50.360 --> 02:11:52.360]  but it's kind of a trait of human nature.
[02:11:52.360 --> 02:11:55.360]  We want to go along with the crowd.
[02:11:55.360 --> 02:11:57.360]  We don't want to be isolated.
[02:11:57.360 --> 02:12:01.360]  We want that security of knowing that we're in the majority.
[02:12:01.360 --> 02:12:06.360]  So if we can be fooled into thinking that the consensus opinion is,
[02:12:06.360 --> 02:12:08.360]  fill in the blank, well, that's where we want to be
[02:12:08.360 --> 02:12:13.360]  if we're not the kind of people that we want to go against the crowd.
[02:12:13.360 --> 02:12:15.360]  Most people don't want to go against the crowd.
[02:12:15.360 --> 02:12:18.360]  It's not pleasant, as we all know here on this program.
[02:12:18.360 --> 02:12:20.360]  You go against the crowd, people don't like you.
[02:12:20.360 --> 02:12:22.360]  They say bad things about you.
[02:12:22.360 --> 02:12:23.360]  They do bad things to you.
[02:12:23.360 --> 02:12:27.360]  So most people don't have the stomach for that kind of competition.
[02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:30.360]  So the short answer to your question, let's get back to it.
[02:12:30.360 --> 02:12:34.360]  I think the forces on both sides are building very rapidly
[02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:37.360]  because both sides realize that we don't have a lot of time,
[02:12:37.360 --> 02:12:42.360]  and if we don't turn this thing around, whatever this deadline is,
[02:12:42.360 --> 02:12:46.360]  I'm very bad at putting dates on things, but it's very close.
[02:12:46.360 --> 02:12:47.360]  It's very close.
[02:12:47.360 --> 02:12:53.360]  I would just be rough to say their goal of 2030 or 2035
[02:12:53.360 --> 02:12:56.360]  for the total wrap-up is conservative.
[02:12:56.360 --> 02:12:59.360]  I think they're shooting for an earlier date than that.
[02:12:59.360 --> 02:13:01.360]  It's very close, whatever that means.
[02:13:01.360 --> 02:13:03.360]  And if we don't turn this thing around,
[02:13:03.360 --> 02:13:08.360]  it may take millennia before future generations can worm their way out
[02:13:08.360 --> 02:13:12.360]  of such total totalitarian control over body and mind.
[02:13:12.360 --> 02:13:15.360]  And they know that if they don't make it in the next,
[02:13:15.360 --> 02:13:19.360]  fill in the number of years, the bonds are going to be broken,
[02:13:19.360 --> 02:13:21.360]  and it may never be assembled again
[02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:24.360]  because by this time it had become a record of history,
[02:13:24.360 --> 02:13:27.360]  that the people rose up and they threw off this tyranny.
[02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:32.360]  They threw off this mind-dumbing hypnotism or this mental manipulation,
[02:13:32.360 --> 02:13:36.360]  and the history books will report on it, and it'll never happen again.
[02:13:36.360 --> 02:13:38.360]  So it's exciting times to live in.
[02:13:38.360 --> 02:13:40.360]  I'm glad we're living in these times.
[02:13:40.360 --> 02:13:42.360]  It's a little scary, to be sure,
[02:13:42.360 --> 02:13:46.360]  but we have a chance to really affect the future.
[02:13:46.360 --> 02:13:49.360]  Well, I want to continue to get your seismograph reading here,
[02:13:49.360 --> 02:13:51.360]  but I want to kind of hone in on one aspect,
[02:13:51.360 --> 02:13:54.360]  and, Mickey, that's the aspect that you so well highlighted
[02:13:54.360 --> 02:13:56.360]  in your plandemic series and in The Great Awakening as well,
[02:13:56.360 --> 02:13:59.360]  which I think had a major impact in your life and others,
[02:13:59.360 --> 02:14:02.360]  and that is the pandemic, the questions, the lockdowns,
[02:14:02.360 --> 02:14:04.360]  then the failed vaccines.
[02:14:04.360 --> 02:14:07.360]  So for you, that had a major impact on you,
[02:14:07.360 --> 02:14:09.360]  and then I want to get G. Edward Griffin's opinion
[02:14:09.360 --> 02:14:11.360]  on the larger seismograph reading if he saw the same thing,
[02:14:11.360 --> 02:14:13.360]  but talking about that for you, Mickey.
[02:14:13.360 --> 02:14:17.360]  Sure, I want to address one simple thing that Ed just said
[02:14:17.360 --> 02:14:18.360]  that's actually very profound
[02:14:18.360 --> 02:14:21.360]  because I think that a lot of the most harmful weapons
[02:14:21.360 --> 02:14:23.360]  that are being used against us are invisible
[02:14:23.360 --> 02:14:25.360]  because they're right in front of our faces.
[02:14:25.360 --> 02:14:28.360]  And so he said that fear of being disliked,
[02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:31.360]  and we really need to take a look at this
[02:14:31.360 --> 02:14:33.360]  because I remember back in 2007,
[02:14:33.360 --> 02:14:35.360]  I was studying user interface.
[02:14:35.360 --> 02:14:41.360]  I was developing some distribution platform technologies for movies,
[02:14:41.360 --> 02:14:43.360]  and I was in the middle of studying this
[02:14:43.360 --> 02:14:47.360]  right when Facebook changed their button from an awesome button,
[02:14:47.360 --> 02:14:49.360]  so when someone would say awesome,
[02:14:49.360 --> 02:14:52.360]  I like what you just said or the video that you just showed,
[02:14:52.360 --> 02:14:54.360]  and they changed it to a like button,
[02:14:54.360 --> 02:14:56.360]  and I thought everything I was studying at the time,
[02:14:56.360 --> 02:14:58.360]  I thought this is such an odd choice
[02:14:58.360 --> 02:15:01.360]  because this kind of is counter to a lot of what I'm learning here.
[02:15:01.360 --> 02:15:04.360]  Why would Facebook, the largest platform in the world,
[02:15:04.360 --> 02:15:05.360]  choose the like button?
[02:15:05.360 --> 02:15:10.360]  And now I realize all the buttons are about following and being liked,
[02:15:10.360 --> 02:15:13.360]  and so we're now addicted so much with this intrinsic need
[02:15:13.360 --> 02:15:15.360]  for us to be part of a collective,
[02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:18.360]  to be connected with people that we agree with,
[02:15:18.360 --> 02:15:20.360]  but this addiction to being liked
[02:15:20.360 --> 02:15:23.360]  is what now has so many people self-censoring.
[02:15:23.360 --> 02:15:27.360]  They don't want to do anything that being liked is now a currency,
[02:15:27.360 --> 02:15:32.360]  and they don't want to do anything that lessens their value in the world.
[02:15:32.360 --> 02:15:34.360]  Well, we are up against the break.
[02:15:34.360 --> 02:15:35.360]  You've got to pause us right there
[02:15:35.360 --> 02:15:38.360]  because this is such a key factor of everything,
[02:15:38.360 --> 02:15:42.360]  and it's about getting you wanting to be connected to the cybernetics,
[02:15:42.360 --> 02:15:45.360]  getting you wanting to be connected to the technotronic
[02:15:45.360 --> 02:15:48.360]  instead of the Earth, instead of fellow humans,
[02:15:48.360 --> 02:15:51.360]  which is the real world that can't be manipulated
[02:15:51.360 --> 02:15:55.360]  by these technotronic kleptomaniacs.
[02:16:21.360 --> 02:16:23.360]  One person might like this coffee.
[02:16:23.360 --> 02:16:24.360]  Another person likes that coffee.
[02:16:24.360 --> 02:16:26.360]  That's how our bodies work.
[02:16:26.360 --> 02:16:27.360]  They're all very diverse.
[02:16:27.360 --> 02:16:30.360]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller
[02:16:30.360 --> 02:16:32.360]  that's been sold for many years that people love

[02:16:57.360 --> 02:16:59.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book,

[02:17:01.360 --> 02:17:03.360]  is a historic book that documents the globalist
[02:17:03.360 --> 02:17:05.360]  in their own words, plan for our future.
[02:17:05.360 --> 02:17:07.360]  That is a hellish future.
[02:17:07.360 --> 02:17:09.360]  Now you'll be always, while they sell a lot of books,
[02:17:09.360 --> 02:17:10.360]  I guess they're starting to ban them,
[02:17:10.360 --> 02:17:13.360]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset in the World for the World
[02:17:13.360 --> 02:17:16.360]  at bookstores, Amazon, or InfowarsWorld.com.
[02:17:16.360 --> 02:17:19.360]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book
[02:17:19.360 --> 02:17:22.360]  after the signed copies we got run out,
[02:17:22.360 --> 02:17:24.360]  and there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[02:17:24.360 --> 02:17:27.360]  So get your copy of The Great Reset in the World for the World,
[02:17:27.360 --> 02:17:30.360]  a signed copy at InfowarsWorld.com.
[02:17:30.360 --> 02:17:34.360]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[02:17:34.360 --> 02:17:37.360]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book,
[02:17:37.360 --> 02:17:40.360]  you'll also know that you help keep Infowars on the air.
[02:17:40.360 --> 02:17:42.360]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book,
[02:17:42.360 --> 02:17:44.360]  or unsigned copies,
[02:17:44.360 --> 02:17:48.360]  and I encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to InfowarsWorld.com
[02:17:48.360 --> 02:17:51.360]  and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies
[02:17:51.360 --> 02:17:54.360]  and donate to the library or get them to the local school.
[02:17:54.360 --> 02:17:57.360]  This is an Infowar, I'm counting on you, and thank you for your support.
[02:17:57.360 --> 02:18:00.360]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots
[02:18:00.360 --> 02:18:03.360]  or the electromagnetic 5G or the GMO crops.
[02:18:03.360 --> 02:18:06.360]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals
[02:18:06.360 --> 02:18:10.360]  that the EPA has authorized companies and industry to use.
[02:18:10.360 --> 02:18:13.360]  One of the top pesticides used is Atrazine,
[02:18:13.360 --> 02:18:17.360]  the allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply
[02:18:17.360 --> 02:18:22.360]  is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[02:18:22.360 --> 02:18:25.360]  Look it up. Don't let them do this to your family.
[02:18:25.360 --> 02:18:28.360]  We have the very best gravity-fed filter system out there.
[02:18:28.360 --> 02:18:31.360]  Highest rated at half the price of leading competitors.

[02:18:34.360 --> 02:18:36.360]  We have replacement filters where folks have already gotten it.
[02:18:36.360 --> 02:18:38.360]  It does 10,000 gallons before you replace them.
[02:18:38.360 --> 02:18:40.360]  It is amazing. It's great for your home, your business.
[02:18:40.360 --> 02:18:42.360]  You can put swamp water in it, tap water,
[02:18:42.360 --> 02:18:44.360]  well water, almost everything's contaminated.
[02:18:44.360 --> 02:18:47.360]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body
[02:18:47.360 --> 02:18:49.360]  and counter the globalist onslaught.

[02:18:55.360 --> 02:18:56.360]  You need this filter.
[02:18:56.360 --> 02:18:59.360]  Infowars is a one-of-a-kind operation,

[02:19:06.360 --> 02:19:07.360]  Cancel anytime.
[02:19:07.360 --> 02:19:11.360]  Every 15 days, every month, every three months, every six months,

[02:19:16.360 --> 02:19:17.360]  whenever you want, you program it.
[02:19:17.360 --> 02:19:18.360]  You just click it,
[02:19:18.360 --> 02:19:20.360]  and then you decide when you want to make a donation.
[02:19:20.360 --> 02:19:21.360]  So please do that as well.
[02:19:21.360 --> 02:19:23.360]  That way we get 95% of it after credit card fees,
[02:19:23.360 --> 02:19:26.360]  instead of making 20%, 30%, 40% like we do on the products.
[02:19:26.360 --> 02:19:28.360]  But these really are amazing products.
[02:19:28.360 --> 02:19:30.360]  The big July 4 sale's going on right now.
[02:19:30.360 --> 02:19:32.360]  This is such a critical platform in the fight against the new world order.
[02:19:32.360 --> 02:19:34.360]  The enemy's out in the open.
[02:19:34.360 --> 02:19:35.360]  We're vindicated.
[02:19:35.360 --> 02:19:36.360]  People are listening more than ever,
[02:19:36.360 --> 02:19:38.360]  but in this major recession, going into depression,
[02:19:38.360 --> 02:19:40.360]  and with supply chain breakdowns,
[02:19:40.360 --> 02:19:41.360]  I know it's hard.
[02:19:41.360 --> 02:19:42.360]  I know times are tough.
[02:19:42.360 --> 02:19:44.360]  So thank you for your support,
[02:19:44.360 --> 02:19:45.360]  but whatever you do, pray for the broadcast,
[02:19:45.360 --> 02:19:47.360]  and share the articles and the videos.
[02:19:47.360 --> 02:19:48.360]  That you can do for free,
[02:19:48.360 --> 02:19:51.360]  and that's just as important as keeping us on air.
[02:19:51.360 --> 02:19:53.360]  So however God leads you in your heart to support us,
[02:19:53.360 --> 02:19:54.360]  please support us now,
[02:19:54.360 --> 02:19:55.360]  and I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[02:19:55.360 --> 02:19:56.360]  God bless you.
[02:20:06.610 --> 02:20:19.610]  When you got G. Edward Griffin and Mickey Willis on, you just let the conversation
[02:20:19.610 --> 02:20:20.610]  flow.
[02:20:20.610 --> 02:20:25.090]  You know, I had an idea where I wanted it to go, but when their minds start to go into
[02:20:25.090 --> 02:20:29.210]  the true knowledge, I say, let's just go with the flow here.
[02:20:29.210 --> 02:20:33.730]  Now, I just want to say something quickly, programming note, there is major news developing
[02:20:33.730 --> 02:20:38.850]  right now, the Hunter Biden business associate, Devin Archer, has just finished his closed
[02:20:38.850 --> 02:20:39.850]  door testimony.
[02:20:39.850 --> 02:20:44.050]  We're starting to get some information about that, and it went like we expected, but slowly
[02:20:44.050 --> 02:20:49.050]  and surely we're learning more as the members of the committee are getting out to the press
[02:20:49.050 --> 02:20:55.130]  and discussing what was talked about in that meeting, but this really feeds into the awakening.
[02:20:55.130 --> 02:20:59.370]  This really feeds into the American public becoming more aware than ever because it's
[02:20:59.370 --> 02:21:03.290]  not just Hunter Biden and Joe Biden that have been selling this country out, and that's
[02:21:03.290 --> 02:21:05.450]  the harsh reality of this situation.
[02:21:05.450 --> 02:21:09.030]  This is not an isolated thing, but it looks like Joe Biden, the Biden crime family may
[02:21:09.030 --> 02:21:13.090]  be the ones to expose it, but let's get back to where we were at when you were interrupted
[02:21:13.090 --> 02:21:16.410]  by the break, Mickey, and I'd love to get G. Edward Griffin's response to this
[02:21:16.410 --> 02:21:22.010]  as well, and that's this, and it's the nuance that's right in front of your face,
[02:21:22.010 --> 02:21:27.930]  like follow, like, and you realize, oh, these are terms that are meant to mean something
[02:21:27.930 --> 02:21:32.610]  to us psychologically and then to get us to buy into this false system where instead
[02:21:32.610 --> 02:21:36.950]  of going out and touching grass or being on the beach or hiking a mountain, or even
[02:21:36.950 --> 02:21:41.810]  just engaging in a physical sport or a combat sport that's real, there's human flesh
[02:21:41.810 --> 02:21:44.410]  and sweat involved in the earth and everything.
[02:21:44.410 --> 02:21:47.010]  That's a real connection that you feel to the creator.
[02:21:47.010 --> 02:21:50.570]  They want to replace that with all their digital creations.
[02:21:50.570 --> 02:21:52.610]  And so you were getting into that before you were interrupted.
[02:21:52.610 --> 02:21:54.890]  Why don't you pick that conversation back up?
[02:21:54.890 --> 02:21:55.890]  Absolutely.
[02:21:55.890 --> 02:21:56.890]  Thanks.
[02:21:56.890 --> 02:22:00.370]  You know, it's one of the reasons why June 3rd, which I thank you for being there
[02:22:00.370 --> 02:22:07.290]  too, Owen, because it was so incredible to be in a room with 2,500 people that are truly
[02:22:07.290 --> 02:22:09.270]  awake, not woke but awake, and get it.
[02:22:09.270 --> 02:22:14.570]  And so having that feeling of kind of celebrating our humanity together, because what's really
[02:22:14.570 --> 02:22:18.890]  at the core of all of this is an anti-human movement.
[02:22:18.890 --> 02:22:24.730]  Because the more my industry, the Hollywood that I escaped, if I look back upon even
[02:22:24.730 --> 02:22:31.010]  my favorite movies and the narratives, particularly sci-fi movies, and you realize how much of
[02:22:31.010 --> 02:22:39.690]  them have promoted an idea that humanity is a failed experiment, a cancer, a parasite.
[02:22:39.690 --> 02:22:44.170]  The more that we buy into this situation, and there are biblical stories that have
[02:22:44.170 --> 02:22:47.910]  taken this too far too, that we almost feel like this life is just something we
[02:22:47.910 --> 02:22:51.850]  pass through so we can actually get to the real life, you know, later on.
[02:22:51.850 --> 02:22:58.050]  That's all very dangerous, because if we don't have reverence for the brilliance and
[02:22:58.050 --> 02:23:03.330]  resilience of the human body, the gift of being alive itself, if they can take that away
[02:23:03.330 --> 02:23:09.130]  from us, if they can take everything away that gives us reason to live and die,
[02:23:09.130 --> 02:23:15.570]  our families, our children, our freedom, all of that, that's really why they're pushing
[02:23:15.570 --> 02:23:22.410]  all of this digital, these fetishes at us, that we become more digitized, more...
[02:23:22.410 --> 02:23:27.210]  I'm very careful, I have two young boys and I recognize that we have to limit their time
[02:23:27.210 --> 02:23:31.530]  on video games because the outside world, the real world, becomes boring to them.
[02:23:31.530 --> 02:23:34.290]  They'll be at a water park and they want to leave early because they want to get home
[02:23:34.290 --> 02:23:37.630]  because they have a half hour left of video game time.
[02:23:37.630 --> 02:23:42.570]  And so it's hard to compete with these 3D graphics and surround sound and all the
[02:23:42.570 --> 02:23:45.310]  stuff that they're forcing at our children.
[02:23:45.310 --> 02:23:52.710]  But as I explained to my children, everything we do on a repetitive basis, from hitting
[02:23:52.710 --> 02:23:56.810]  the like buttons to following, everything we do repetitively, all the scrolling of
[02:23:56.810 --> 02:24:02.050]  our phones, carves neural pathways, and those neural pathways, after a while, become
[02:24:02.050 --> 02:24:03.050]  a rut.
[02:24:03.050 --> 02:24:06.730]  And if you've ever seen water run down a hill, it'll find those ruts to group together
[02:24:06.730 --> 02:24:10.530]  and expedite the water's travel.
[02:24:10.530 --> 02:24:14.490]  And these people that are running these agendas that understand the human mind far better than
[02:24:14.490 --> 02:24:19.330]  we do, because they've spent lifetimes exploring us and studying us, they will then
[02:24:19.330 --> 02:24:23.710]  channel their information into these ruts that are carved through the technology that
[02:24:23.710 --> 02:24:28.770]  they've made us addicted to, and we won't even have dominion over our choices anymore.
[02:24:28.770 --> 02:24:31.550]  Next thing we'll know, we'll be like the people out in the streets, which I used
[02:24:31.550 --> 02:24:36.290]  to be, out in the streets chanting slogans that I had no idea even what they meant,
[02:24:36.290 --> 02:24:40.450]  until I finally started to question myself, am I hypnotized?
[02:24:40.450 --> 02:24:45.370]  And that's what I revealed in the movie, and that was the awakening moment for me to ask
[02:24:45.370 --> 02:24:48.130]  myself that question, am I hypnotized?
[02:24:48.130 --> 02:24:50.770]  And that's when I suddenly, as I say in the movie, it's like a faith healing,
[02:24:50.770 --> 02:24:52.970]  because I could suddenly see what I couldn't see before.
[02:24:52.970 --> 02:24:55.210]  I was unblind in a matter of moments.
[02:24:55.210 --> 02:24:57.890]  That is really an incredible breakdown there.
[02:24:57.890 --> 02:25:03.450]  And I would even add that when you realize those neural pathways have been created, you
[02:25:03.450 --> 02:25:05.650]  actually, this is the beautiful power of the mind.
[02:25:05.650 --> 02:25:11.730]  You can build a dam and block them from becoming the pathways, and you can revert that energy,
[02:25:11.730 --> 02:25:13.250]  revert that thought process.
[02:25:13.250 --> 02:25:17.450]  G. Edward Griffin, you know, I wanted to get your kind of, if you think about, let's
[02:25:17.450 --> 02:25:22.410]  say you've got a 50-year seismograph of the awakening, what do you see when it comes
[02:25:22.410 --> 02:25:25.770]  to the Richter scale during the pandemic, during the vaccines?
[02:25:25.770 --> 02:25:29.610]  Is it the biggest measurement you've seen?
[02:25:29.610 --> 02:25:32.010]  Is it up there with some other things you've seen?
[02:25:32.010 --> 02:25:33.890]  Where does it rank here, what we've seen recently?
[02:25:36.810 --> 02:25:40.290]  Well, it's certainly the biggest thing I've seen in my lifetime.
[02:25:40.290 --> 02:25:47.330]  It's hard for me to judge what human reaction would have been, let's say at the time, let's
[02:25:47.330 --> 02:25:53.850]  say you were in the frontier days, and you came over to America, and you had to plow
[02:25:53.850 --> 02:26:01.130]  westward in a covered wagon and fight off hostile tribes that didn't like you being
[02:26:01.130 --> 02:26:05.050]  there, they thought that you should go back, or they wanted your stuff.
[02:26:05.050 --> 02:26:09.890]  Very few people made it all the way across the plains, a lot of them passed along.
[02:26:09.890 --> 02:26:12.810]  And then would we really want to live in those days?
[02:26:12.810 --> 02:26:16.650]  I have a feeling that there were plenty of times in history and throughout different
[02:26:16.650 --> 02:26:21.970]  places of the world where the upheaval would have been equal to certainly what we are
[02:26:21.970 --> 02:26:27.650]  experiencing now in the Western world with the COVID theater.
[02:26:27.650 --> 02:26:30.090]  But I don't know, I didn't live in those times.
[02:26:30.090 --> 02:26:34.450]  In my lifetime, this is the biggest thing because it affected so many aspects of our
[02:26:34.450 --> 02:26:40.570]  lives at once, and there were profound affectations.
[02:26:40.570 --> 02:26:42.530]  We're going to be lucky if we can recover from them.
[02:26:42.530 --> 02:26:46.650]  We're going to have some scar tissue left from the encounter, and it's going to be
[02:26:46.650 --> 02:26:49.290]  around for a long time, but I think we can.
[02:26:49.290 --> 02:26:51.210]  There's going to be scar tissue there.
[02:26:51.210 --> 02:26:55.450]  So it's the biggest thing in my lifetime, probably most people would agree with that.
[02:26:55.450 --> 02:27:01.810]  But when you look at history, I think they're equal times where life was very, very questionable
[02:27:01.810 --> 02:27:04.930]  and survival was very, very questionable too.
[02:27:04.930 --> 02:27:09.590]  But the thing that's different, I think, about today is the technology.
[02:27:09.590 --> 02:27:17.890]  Up until fairly recently, the ultimate battle was always on the battlefield.
[02:27:17.890 --> 02:27:24.030]  The question of whether you were going to be a servant or a master over some other
[02:27:24.030 --> 02:27:29.970]  group of people, an individual even, was your ability to overpower that group or that
[02:27:29.970 --> 02:27:32.550]  individual with physical force.
[02:27:32.550 --> 02:27:37.970]  That's why there's always been so much emphasis on weaponry and defense mechanisms
[02:27:37.970 --> 02:27:42.190]  and so forth, and why the budgets are so big for the military.
[02:27:42.190 --> 02:27:46.870]  Because as I've tried to explain to a lot of my idealistic friends, you can't
[02:27:46.870 --> 02:27:51.510]  just hold up a little paper copy of the Constitution and say, you can't do this
[02:27:51.510 --> 02:27:52.510]  to me.
[02:27:52.510 --> 02:27:53.510]  I have my rights.
[02:27:53.510 --> 02:27:58.590]  So right here in the Constitution, you can't do it to them.
[02:27:58.590 --> 02:28:04.550]  Kind of a naive point of view, of course, they can do it to you if they've got a gun
[02:28:04.550 --> 02:28:05.550]  to your head.
[02:28:05.550 --> 02:28:11.470]  It's between having a right and being able to exercise your right.
[02:28:11.470 --> 02:28:20.670]  And so we come to the harsh reality that our rights really are earned and won on the
[02:28:20.670 --> 02:28:21.670]  battlefield.
[02:28:21.670 --> 02:28:29.750]  The colonialists who stood firm against the King George during the American Revolution
[02:28:29.750 --> 02:28:36.510]  had not won that contest in the field, had they not won the war.
[02:28:36.510 --> 02:28:37.510]  There would be no...
[02:28:37.510 --> 02:28:42.870]  All right, we had a little choppy connection there at the end, but we're up against the
[02:28:42.870 --> 02:28:43.870]  break here.
[02:28:43.870 --> 02:28:46.870]  So we'll be right back with G. Edward Griffin and Mickey Willis.
[02:28:46.870 --> 02:28:51.630]  We're talking about the Great Awakening, the Renaissance that we're all experiencing,
[02:28:51.630 --> 02:28:57.670]  going through together right now.
[02:28:57.670 --> 02:29:02.550]  For everything the globalists hit us with, God through Mother Nature has given us the
[02:29:02.550 --> 02:29:03.550]  answer.
[02:29:03.550 --> 02:29:07.190]  I don't have to sell you on CBD oil, full spectrum CBD oil, the incredible things
[02:29:07.190 --> 02:29:12.590]  it does for your nerves, your brain, your entire physiological system, for your nervous
[02:29:12.590 --> 02:29:14.150]  system particularly.
[02:29:14.150 --> 02:29:15.150]  Everybody knows it's incredible.
[02:29:15.150 --> 02:29:16.150]  It works.
[02:29:16.150 --> 02:29:20.750]  We have the strongest, best CBD oil you're going to find anywhere at the lowest price.
[02:29:20.750 --> 02:29:27.510]  Yes, you can find this same CBD oil for 30% more because that's who we're getting it from,
[02:29:27.510 --> 02:29:30.270]  made right here in Central Texas.
[02:29:30.270 --> 02:29:33.910]  Our private label name is Rebel Zen.
[02:29:33.910 --> 02:29:39.390]  Rebel Zen is a private label of one of the top three or four CBD makers in the country
[02:29:39.390 --> 02:29:42.350]  that's based right here in Texas, and we're giving it to you at 30% off.
[02:29:42.350 --> 02:29:46.170]  And here's what's even crazier, 30% off of what they're selling it for.
[02:29:46.170 --> 02:29:49.350]  They're selling theirs for 30% off what their competitors are.
[02:29:49.350 --> 02:29:53.670]  So this is the highest rated, already at the lowest price, not even a lower price.
[02:29:53.670 --> 02:29:57.350]  Rebel Zen, get yours at mfootworkstore.com now.
[02:29:57.350 --> 02:29:58.350]  You wanted to plug Brainforce.
[02:29:58.350 --> 02:29:59.350]  Do you like Brainforce?
[02:29:59.350 --> 02:30:00.350]  Yeah.
[02:30:00.350 --> 02:30:02.070]  So my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[02:30:02.070 --> 02:30:04.370]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[02:30:04.370 --> 02:30:08.390]  Four books with Dr. Judy Mikovits, four books with Project Veritas whistleblowers, and now
[02:30:08.390 --> 02:30:10.690]  two books with Alex Jones.
[02:30:10.690 --> 02:30:14.030]  That's because I use Brainforce every day.
[02:30:14.030 --> 02:30:17.950]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[02:30:17.950 --> 02:30:22.930]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins, but the one thing that
[02:30:22.930 --> 02:30:27.350]  I have really found that makes a difference is Brainforce.
[02:30:27.350 --> 02:30:32.170]  I'll take Brainforce in the morning, right before I go to my computer, and I'm good
[02:30:32.170 --> 02:30:35.170]  for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[02:30:35.170 --> 02:30:40.110]  So it really is true that Brainforce is something I use every day, and it helps me
[02:30:40.110 --> 02:30:41.110]  with my writing.
[02:30:41.110 --> 02:30:42.110]  All right, we love you.
[02:30:42.110 --> 02:30:43.110]  We'll be right back.

[02:32:18.590 --> 02:32:19.590]  We'll be right back with hour number three.
[02:32:19.590 --> 02:32:20.590]  We'll be right back with hour number three.
[02:32:48.590 --> 02:32:52.590]  You can have clean drinking water and a remedy to this madness.
[02:32:52.590 --> 02:32:55.590]  Available now at infowarsstore.com.
[02:32:56.880 --> 02:33:06.160]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:07.580 --> 02:33:28.580]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show. And now your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:33:28.580 --> 02:33:33.580]  There's a lot of great camaraderie happening between patriots right now.
[02:33:33.580 --> 02:33:41.580]  And of course, as Mickey Willis stated earlier, the premiere of his latest documentary right here in Austin, Texas was a great time.
[02:33:41.580 --> 02:33:51.580]  And now we have the Red Pill Expo coming up. G. Edward Griffin with us. What can you tell us about the Red Pill Expo?
[02:33:51.580 --> 02:33:58.580]  Well, I imagine that by now, most of the people in this audience know the significance of the meme, the red pill.
[02:33:58.580 --> 02:34:05.580]  Take the red pill, man. Wake up to reality. Get rid of your illusions. See life the way it really is.
[02:34:05.580 --> 02:34:10.580]  It all comes from the sci-fi movie, The Matrix, about 20 or 21 years ago.
[02:34:10.580 --> 02:34:18.580]  So we adopted that meme because we thought it was a popular way to approach some very deep and heavy topics.
[02:34:18.580 --> 02:34:23.580]  And normally, you know, in the past, old guys like me, we were used to coming on strong with,
[02:34:23.580 --> 02:34:28.580]  let's talk about the Constitution, let's talk about the right to freedom of speech and so forth.
[02:34:28.580 --> 02:34:34.580]  And we can get serious about the division of powers and all this sort of thing, which is all good.
[02:34:34.580 --> 02:34:39.580]  And scholars need to do that. We need to have a foundation like that on our movement.
[02:34:39.580 --> 02:34:46.580]  But to the large numbers of people out there, they get glazed over eyes when you start talking about that.
[02:34:46.580 --> 02:34:49.580]  So we thought we would try something to popularize these themes.
[02:34:49.580 --> 02:34:53.580]  And it seemed like the red pill was the perfect meme for.
[02:34:53.580 --> 02:35:00.580]  We tried it back in 1917 to see if it would work, if we could get people out to our events on that theme,
[02:35:00.580 --> 02:35:03.580]  rather than, you know, defend liberty. And it worked.
[02:35:03.580 --> 02:35:08.580]  So we were worried that people would think it was very pop psychology stuff.
[02:35:08.580 --> 02:35:14.580]  But no, it's very popular. And the good thing about it is that it's real.
[02:35:14.580 --> 02:35:17.580]  It's not just a slogan. It's not just to have fun.
[02:35:17.580 --> 02:35:23.580]  When you think about it, the real world in which we live is very parallel to this theme of the Matrix movie.
[02:35:23.580 --> 02:35:25.580]  So what is the red pill expo?
[02:35:25.580 --> 02:35:32.580]  What's the place where we have people who are presenters, all of whom have very excellent credentials.
[02:35:32.580 --> 02:35:40.580]  Most of them are very highly considered very high ranking professionals in their field.
[02:35:40.580 --> 02:35:43.580]  We have doctors and lawyers, teachers and all kinds of professionals.
[02:35:43.580 --> 02:35:46.580]  Some of them are just researchers and writers and so forth.
[02:35:46.580 --> 02:35:50.580]  And all of them have taken a red pill, at least one in their lives, and it shocked them.
[02:35:50.580 --> 02:35:54.580]  It blew them out of their complacency, you might say.
[02:35:54.580 --> 02:35:58.580]  And now they are dedicating their lives to try and tell other people about it
[02:35:58.580 --> 02:36:04.580]  so that they can discover the same red pill, the same reality, the same illusion that needs to be broken.
[02:36:04.580 --> 02:36:06.580]  That they did, only they can do it faster.
[02:36:06.580 --> 02:36:10.580]  So that's what we do a couple of times a year, sometimes only once a year.
[02:36:10.580 --> 02:36:13.580]  We put out an event called the Red Pill Expo.
[02:36:13.580 --> 02:36:19.580]  And it's where we gather together some of the best red pill dispensers you can find.
[02:36:19.580 --> 02:36:21.580]  And we're loaded with them every time.
[02:36:21.580 --> 02:36:22.580]  Mickey is going to be there, of course.
[02:36:22.580 --> 02:36:27.580]  He's one of our top hitters this time and other times as well.
[02:36:27.580 --> 02:36:30.580]  But we have a lot of others and they're going to tell us the way it really is.
[02:36:30.580 --> 02:36:33.580]  I'll be there to do my best to add to the stew.
[02:36:33.580 --> 02:36:37.580]  But the main thing is people like your listeners get to come.
[02:36:37.580 --> 02:36:40.580]  Most of these people think they're all alone.
[02:36:40.580 --> 02:36:43.580]  They don't realize that we're still in the majority out there.
[02:36:43.580 --> 02:36:48.580]  And so when people would decide, they come to the point where, well, we have to do something about this.
[02:36:48.580 --> 02:36:50.580]  I mean, all right, I'm tired of hearing about the problem.
[02:36:50.580 --> 02:36:54.580]  I know about the problem. What are we going to do about it?
[02:36:54.580 --> 02:36:56.580]  So this is where we get serious.
[02:36:56.580 --> 02:37:04.580]  Well, we bring people together because you can't build a movement, a counterpunch against this, let's call it what it is.
[02:37:04.580 --> 02:37:06.580]  It's a conspiracy.
[02:37:06.580 --> 02:37:08.580]  A lot of little conspiracies and a big one.
[02:37:08.580 --> 02:37:09.580]  That's what it is.
[02:37:09.580 --> 02:37:13.580]  You can't counterpunch that on the Internet by sending e-mails to each other.
[02:37:13.580 --> 02:37:26.580]  You've got to get together face to face with people in your local communities and start building boots on the ground organizational structures locally and build upward, not start at the top and build down.
[02:37:26.580 --> 02:37:33.580]  We have to build little groups that can be influential in who is going to be on the board of supervisors in your county.
[02:37:33.580 --> 02:37:35.580]  Who's going to be on the city council?
[02:37:35.580 --> 02:37:36.580]  Who's the mayor going to be?
[02:37:36.580 --> 02:37:38.580]  Who's the sheriff going to be?
[02:37:38.580 --> 02:37:41.580]  These are the places where we need to start to build a movement.
[02:37:41.580 --> 02:37:49.580]  If we're serious about turning this thing around, if we just want to complain about it, that's one thing.
[02:37:49.580 --> 02:37:55.580]  But now if we want to do something about it, we've got to come together.
[02:37:55.580 --> 02:38:01.580]  And this is the end.
[02:38:01.580 --> 02:38:05.580]  We're getting a choppy connection there with G. Edward Griffin.
[02:38:06.580 --> 02:38:18.580]  We're reestablishing a good connection here, but I think the reason why the red pill or even putting on the glasses like in They Live is such a perfect metaphor because once you've taken the red pill, once you've put the glasses on, you see the world differently.
[02:38:18.580 --> 02:38:30.580]  You see it for what it is, whether that's they want to roll out a vaccine that you know is most likely not going to be healthy or what you know about the global government when they want to hand over power to the World Health Organization.
[02:38:30.580 --> 02:38:38.580]  So talk about that, Mickey, and how once you've taken the red pill, as they say, you can't unsee the world for what it really is.
[02:38:38.580 --> 02:38:40.580]  That's right. You can no longer unsee.
[02:38:40.580 --> 02:38:45.580]  And I have to thank Ed for being one of those red pills that helped me see.
[02:38:45.580 --> 02:38:57.580]  I do want to say, to really praise Ed for a moment, there's a real reason that I chose to make him such a large part of my third installment of the plandemic series.
[02:38:57.580 --> 02:39:00.580]  He's really the thread, the guide through the movie.
[02:39:00.580 --> 02:39:11.580]  And that's because out of the hundreds of people that I've interviewed on these subjects, even though he's in his early 90s, he's been doing this long before many of us were even born.
[02:39:11.580 --> 02:39:16.580]  He's one of the most humble scholars of this information.
[02:39:16.580 --> 02:39:21.580]  I have never had anyone sit in the chair across from me more willing to say I don't know than G. Edward Griffin.
[02:39:21.580 --> 02:39:25.580]  And that says a lot, right? Because there's a lot of people that get caught up in their own personas.
[02:39:25.580 --> 02:39:30.580]  They become an expert, quote unquote, and they suddenly know everything.
[02:39:30.580 --> 02:39:46.580]  What I really appreciate about Ed and why I advise everyone to take a serious look at his education through the red pill university is that he uses historical facts and he expands upon that using common sense, but very little opinion.
[02:39:46.580 --> 02:39:53.580]  And that's what struck me when I saw the first film I saw of Ed's was more deadly than war, which is a big part of plandemic three, the great awakening.
[02:39:53.580 --> 02:39:58.580]  And I was just struck that he wasn't willing to really give his own opinion about what he was reading.
[02:39:58.580 --> 02:40:02.580]  He was only reading from their workbooks and their manifestos.
[02:40:02.580 --> 02:40:06.580]  And that is the future communists that are here to take over our nation.
[02:40:06.580 --> 02:40:12.580]  He was letting the world know this is what they say they're going to do and this is how they're going to do it.
[02:40:12.580 --> 02:40:15.580]  We better listen. And very few people listen to him in the 60s.
[02:40:15.580 --> 02:40:22.580]  Unfortunately, it's taken all this time for us to to open our ears to what's happening and open our eyes.
[02:40:22.580 --> 02:40:31.580]  But that is really the power of Ed's red pill is is while there's so many opinions out there and ideologies and some of them are trendy.
[02:40:31.580 --> 02:40:33.580]  They're they're they're everything today.
[02:40:33.580 --> 02:40:35.580]  And then they go away tomorrow. They're disproven.
[02:40:35.580 --> 02:40:41.580]  His work has withstood the test of time because he sticks to the historical facts.
[02:40:41.580 --> 02:40:49.580]  And that's what I found to be so compelling and such a great addition to to my awakening is really the work of Edward Griffin.
[02:40:49.580 --> 02:40:55.580]  And so I'm I'm honored to to be on the air with him and to be working with him now.
[02:40:55.580 --> 02:41:05.580]  Well, and it looks like his connection is back. And I'm and I'm curious what he thinks about the the psychological aspect of this G Edward Griffin.
[02:41:05.580 --> 02:41:16.580]  How important is it for people to understand that the individuals that are forcing us into this global government, they do have a will to dominate you.
[02:41:16.580 --> 02:41:22.580]  And it's a it's a will that's exact. It's been around in human history. It's been studied and documented in human history for a long time.
[02:41:22.580 --> 02:41:28.580]  That will didn't go anywhere just because we read about it in a history book. It's still right here in front of us.
[02:41:28.580 --> 02:41:35.580]  How important is it for people to understand that human psychology that no, these people that run the World Economic Forum telling you you'll own nothing and be happy.
[02:41:35.580 --> 02:41:42.580]  They have a will to dominate you.
[02:41:43.580 --> 02:41:54.580]  Because that's the name of the game. It's hard for normal people if there is such a category.
[02:41:54.580 --> 02:42:00.580]  Guys, I think we're going to have to reestablish a connection here. We just got it's real choppy. Mickey, I'll let you respond to that.
[02:42:00.580 --> 02:42:05.580]  Sure. Can you rephrase that, please? I wasn't listening as deeply as I would if I'd known it was for me.
[02:42:05.580 --> 02:42:12.580]  The psychological aspect of the individuals that want to put us into this global government system, that they have a will to dominate you.
[02:42:12.580 --> 02:42:16.580]  It's important for people to understand that, otherwise they can't believe it's going on.
[02:42:16.580 --> 02:42:24.580]  Yeah, they sure do. And, you know, we've been studying deeply the archetypes of the people that are at the helm of these agendas.
[02:42:24.580 --> 02:42:28.580]  And one thing they all have in common is they're all atheists, self-proclaimed atheists.
[02:42:28.580 --> 02:42:34.580]  I find that to be very interesting. So there's definitely something to be found in faith and believing in a higher power.
[02:42:34.580 --> 02:42:49.580]  I really suggest that people, if you have rejected that in your life, I'm kind of a newly found or found myself through understanding that there is a great infinite intelligence.
[02:42:49.580 --> 02:42:56.580]  That's an amazing thing right there. One last break and then the final segment with G. Edward Griffin and Mickey Willis on the other side.
[02:43:04.580 --> 02:43:13.580]  Well, yeah, the first one, you obviously can go to MyPillow.com, use that promo code Alex, and you can get all these great discounts on all of our products.
[02:43:13.580 --> 02:43:19.580]  And just by visiting this site, you're going to get a $20 free gift emailed to you immediately.
[02:43:19.580 --> 02:43:28.580]  And there's the biggest special we have right now, the 20-year anniversary MyPillow for $19.98 for the queen size, normally $69.98.
[02:43:28.580 --> 02:43:34.580]  We're celebrating our anniversary with what my employees love to invest, producing and making the MyPillow.
[02:43:34.580 --> 02:43:44.580]  And the model of businessmen and women with can-do know-how, using the money for Americana freedom to fight the globalists is what they fear.
[02:43:44.580 --> 02:43:47.580]  That's what the deep banking is about. That's what the financial attacks are about.
[02:43:47.580 --> 02:43:55.580]  That's why we've got a rush to support MyPillow.com and Infowars.com, plus their great products at both places, because we are the tip of the spear.
[02:43:58.580 --> 02:44:03.580]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had. I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:44:03.580 --> 02:44:07.580]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:44:07.580 --> 02:44:16.580]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:44:16.580 --> 02:44:25.580]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[02:44:26.580 --> 02:44:29.580]  So for myself and the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:44:29.580 --> 02:44:35.580]  And I want to encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:44:35.580 --> 02:44:38.580]  I know you spread the word. I know you pray for us. That's wonderful. Keep doing it.
[02:44:38.580 --> 02:44:47.580]  But most viewers and listeners never go to Infowarsstore.com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time give us on air.
[02:44:47.580 --> 02:44:51.580]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:44:51.580 --> 02:44:57.580]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to Infowarsstore.com, our funding problems will be over. Please take action now.
[02:44:57.580 --> 02:45:06.580]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia, the insanity, the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy,
[02:45:06.580 --> 02:45:12.580]  you are crazy in my view if you don't get high quality storeable food and water filtration and self-defense.
[02:45:12.580 --> 02:45:17.580]  Now we're not selling guns and ammo. That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[02:45:18.580 --> 02:45:24.580]  And I'm preaching to the choir on that. But a lot of people got plenty of guns but they don't have enough storeable food or water filtration.
[02:45:24.580 --> 02:45:30.580]  This is something you need now and we've got it in the food department and in the high quality water filtration department.
[02:45:30.580 --> 02:45:36.580]  The highest quality food, the best water filtration at the lowest prices you're going to find and still get quality.
[02:45:36.580 --> 02:45:44.580]  Infowarsstore.com is running a special right now for 10% off on all storeable food and on water and air filtration.
[02:45:44.580 --> 02:45:51.580]  Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot beat this deal. Our prices are already the lowest. At 10% off, it's an insane deal for a limited time.
[02:45:51.580 --> 02:45:55.580]  Go to Infowarsstore.com and get prepared while you still can.
[02:45:58.580 --> 02:46:07.580]  It's been three years since we had it. We got it back in stock, the amazing 30 parts per million, highest quality colloidal silver and all the great things and all the great uses.
[02:46:07.580 --> 02:46:18.580]  Back in stock, limited supply, Infowarsstore.com, 30% off and it's a very limited supply but we have it back.
[02:46:18.580 --> 02:46:25.580]  Infowarsstore.com, Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver, Infowars Live Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver has returned.
[02:46:25.580 --> 02:46:36.580]  Silver Bullet is the answer to Alex's extensive search for a powerful colloidal silver product that utilizes high quality processes to ensure for a truly unique product
[02:46:36.580 --> 02:46:44.580]  that has applications for both preparedness and regular use. It is amazing, it's got thousands of reviews, 5 star reviews.
[02:46:44.580 --> 02:46:57.580]  Infowarsstore.com, Silver Bullet returns to Infowarsstore.com and while you're there, get some super female vitality, some turbo force, some brain force and some brain force ultra.
[02:46:58.580 --> 02:47:05.580]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:06.580 --> 02:47:08.580]  Thank you for watching.
[02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:25.000]  All right, we've at least got better audio with G. Edward Griffin.
[02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:30.880]  If you can't see his beautiful white beard, if it's a little muffled with the shuffling
[02:47:30.880 --> 02:47:34.640]  on the digital presentation here, that's okay because we'll have his legendary voice here
[02:47:34.640 --> 02:47:36.960]  with us.
[02:47:36.960 --> 02:47:41.880]  But I wanted to get your take, G. Edward Griffin, on the psychology element of this and how
[02:47:41.880 --> 02:47:44.560]  important it is because a lot of people can't believe it.
[02:47:44.560 --> 02:47:47.840]  They can't believe, oh, why would somebody want to put me into a global system?
[02:47:47.840 --> 02:47:48.840]  Nobody wants to make me a slave.
[02:47:48.840 --> 02:47:49.840]  No, no, no, no.
[02:47:49.840 --> 02:47:50.840]  It's not going on.
[02:47:50.840 --> 02:47:51.840]  It can't be.
[02:47:51.840 --> 02:47:52.840]  It can't be.
[02:47:52.840 --> 02:47:55.400]  But we understand that will is there and it's all around you.
[02:47:55.400 --> 02:47:56.600]  Your perspective changes.
[02:47:56.600 --> 02:48:01.480]  How important do you think it is for people to consume the red pill, as we call it, for
[02:48:01.480 --> 02:48:05.720]  them to understand the psychological aspect of what the global government represents?
[02:48:06.720 --> 02:48:09.440]  Well, I think it's utterly important.
[02:48:09.440 --> 02:48:12.080]  It's probably the most important thing.
[02:48:12.080 --> 02:48:16.960]  In fact, as we were waiting earlier for a connection, I was looking at the name of
[02:48:16.960 --> 02:48:19.040]  their Infowars.
[02:48:19.040 --> 02:48:24.400]  And I was remembering way back in the day when I first heard about Infowars, hadn't
[02:48:24.400 --> 02:48:29.400]  met Alex or anything like that, I thought, well, what a silly name that is.
[02:48:29.400 --> 02:48:35.680]  And I've come to honor it a great deal since then because I realized that is it.
[02:48:35.680 --> 02:48:39.600]  Information is the weapon of war in our modern time.
[02:48:39.600 --> 02:48:41.800]  Now, this sounds like it's mundane.
[02:48:41.800 --> 02:48:45.640]  Everybody knows this, but I think it needs to be said that in the ancient times, whatever
[02:48:45.640 --> 02:48:50.600]  that means, but a long time ago, the way you conquered people is you just, you overpowered
[02:48:50.600 --> 02:48:51.600]  them physically.
[02:48:51.600 --> 02:48:59.000]  You had more, more soldiers, more swords and bows and arrows and things like that.
[02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:03.280]  And as the technology advanced, they went to, well, bows and arrows went to rifles
[02:49:03.280 --> 02:49:07.320]  and then they went to missiles, and then they went to chemical warfare and A-bombs
[02:49:07.320 --> 02:49:08.320]  and so forth.
[02:49:08.320 --> 02:49:12.160]  But it's still the whole idea was that if you wanted to conquer somebody, you just
[02:49:12.160 --> 02:49:16.880]  defeated them physically, they couldn't resist and they better shut up and get in line
[02:49:16.880 --> 02:49:18.720]  or else you kill them.
[02:49:18.720 --> 02:49:24.080]  That's the way it was for all the first, whatever, the millennium of human history.
[02:49:24.080 --> 02:49:29.640]  And then starting sometime around the, oh, the French Revolution in there and the writings
[02:49:29.640 --> 02:49:37.160]  of Carol Marx and the idea of the people became for the first time significant and
[02:49:37.160 --> 02:49:41.240]  with the printing press and all of that, people began to get the idea that they should
[02:49:41.240 --> 02:49:43.680]  have a voice in their political destiny.
[02:49:43.680 --> 02:49:45.440]  Well, that changed everything.
[02:49:45.440 --> 02:49:49.880]  Now, from that point forward, and certainly in the last couple of world wars, all the
[02:49:49.880 --> 02:49:53.200]  weapons of destruction were still very, very important.
[02:49:53.200 --> 02:49:57.760]  You could see that both the armies on all sides of these conflicts were very interested
[02:49:57.760 --> 02:49:59.320]  in propaganda.
[02:49:59.320 --> 02:50:04.960]  And that's where these security agencies came into being, the spy agencies, not just
[02:50:04.960 --> 02:50:09.600]  because they wanted to bomb your factories and things like that, which they still did,
[02:50:09.600 --> 02:50:11.800]  but they wanted to control the media.
[02:50:11.800 --> 02:50:14.400]  They wanted to control the flow of information.
[02:50:14.400 --> 02:50:18.400]  And I think the American military sends it pretty well in their manuals.
[02:50:18.400 --> 02:50:21.320]  They say they must have information dominance.
[02:50:21.320 --> 02:50:27.620]  That way, they don't have to shoot anybody or force them against their will to do what
[02:50:27.620 --> 02:50:28.620]  you want.
[02:50:28.620 --> 02:50:32.140]  You convince them that it's in their own best interest and they'll do it voluntarily.
[02:50:32.140 --> 02:50:35.260]  So from that point forward, that's the name of the game.
[02:50:35.260 --> 02:50:37.100]  And today, it's total.
[02:50:37.100 --> 02:50:43.180]  People, yeah, they still use guns and bayonets, so to speak, in case all else fails, but
[02:50:43.180 --> 02:50:45.700]  all else does not fail.
[02:50:45.700 --> 02:50:49.780]  Even the atomic bomb was primarily a psychological weapon.
[02:50:49.780 --> 02:50:55.960]  It was fear of the atomic bomb that conquered more and did more to defeat an enemy than
[02:50:55.960 --> 02:50:57.800]  the actual destruction itself.
[02:50:57.800 --> 02:51:00.120]  It was fear of more of the same.
[02:51:00.120 --> 02:51:07.740]  So it reminds me of, I think it was Genghis Khan that used to go through the Asian slopes
[02:51:07.740 --> 02:51:12.240]  and he would demand that a city would surrender, a little town or a village had a wall around
[02:51:12.240 --> 02:51:13.240]  it.
[02:51:13.240 --> 02:51:17.400]  And if they didn't, he would bring his army to bear on the wall.
[02:51:17.400 --> 02:51:20.760]  And if they had to stay there for months on end, they would stay until they could
[02:51:20.760 --> 02:51:23.560]  finally breach the wall and get inside.
[02:51:23.560 --> 02:51:27.760]  And when they got inside, they killed every living thing, including dogs, cats, canaries,
[02:51:27.760 --> 02:51:28.940]  and everything else.
[02:51:28.940 --> 02:51:34.280]  And they stacked their skulls out at the front of the gate so that along the road
[02:51:34.280 --> 02:51:40.080]  as the travelers and the traders on their camels went by, they could see the stack
[02:51:40.080 --> 02:51:43.660]  of human skulls and dogs and cats and canary skulls.
[02:51:43.660 --> 02:51:47.440]  And the word got around that you just don't cross Genghis Khan.
[02:51:47.440 --> 02:51:51.640]  Well, that made it easier for Genghis Khan, he didn't have to invade so many cities.
[02:51:51.640 --> 02:51:55.920]  So the point I'm just trying to make is, this is pretty obvious, everybody knows it,
[02:51:55.920 --> 02:52:00.880]  that psychologically, the weapons of psychology are very, very strong.
[02:52:00.880 --> 02:52:03.600]  And in today's world, they're the strongest.
[02:52:03.600 --> 02:52:07.920]  And people are reacting today, as you said earlier, they just can't believe it.
[02:52:07.920 --> 02:52:10.000]  Well, why can't they believe it?
[02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:15.020]  It's because their information has convinced them that anybody that talks about these
[02:52:15.020 --> 02:52:18.600]  things is a woo-woo, is a nutcase, that's why they can't believe it.
[02:52:18.600 --> 02:52:22.920]  It's not that it's theological, it's just that they're not allowed to consider the logic,
[02:52:22.920 --> 02:52:25.720]  they're just following the consensus or what they think it is.
[02:52:25.720 --> 02:52:31.180]  So the short answer to your question is, this is an era in which information and
[02:52:31.180 --> 02:52:35.360]  psychology is the ultimate weapon, the ultimate weapon.
[02:52:35.360 --> 02:52:42.000]  And if we don't understand that at a gut level, we're going to be susceptible to that weapon
[02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:43.880]  ourselves, we'll fall for it.
[02:52:43.880 --> 02:52:47.200]  And so what more can I say, it's number one on the list.
[02:52:47.240 --> 02:52:52.840]  And Mickey, you were saying, your observation was that a lot of the individuals involved
[02:52:52.840 --> 02:52:56.880]  in some of these globalist groups, the World Economic Forum, the World Health Organization,
[02:52:56.880 --> 02:53:01.520]  they are proud atheists, it's also been observed many of them don't have children.
[02:53:01.520 --> 02:53:04.160]  How do you think that weighs into this?
[02:53:04.160 --> 02:53:07.420]  I'm so glad you brought that up, because that's the next thing I was going to discuss.
[02:53:07.420 --> 02:53:11.720]  This might seem simplistic for some of your listeners, but I tell you, there's some
[02:53:11.720 --> 02:53:16.760]  really something to this and that is, if we really want to change the world, we need
[02:53:16.760 --> 02:53:18.920]  to become better parents.
[02:53:18.920 --> 02:53:23.160]  Because at the root of a lot of these issues, and there's a reason when we did an expose
[02:53:23.160 --> 02:53:25.800]  on Bill Gates that we wanted to feature who his father was.
[02:53:25.800 --> 02:53:29.880]  There's a reason that when we did an expose on Klaus Schwab, we featured who his father
[02:53:29.880 --> 02:53:30.880]  was.
[02:53:30.880 --> 02:53:33.220]  The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
[02:53:33.220 --> 02:53:36.920]  And these men that are out there, I believe that it's almost like Revenge of the Nerds.
[02:53:36.920 --> 02:53:41.640]  You have a group of very powerful, rich people who didn't get their fair shake in
[02:53:41.640 --> 02:53:45.120]  the world, didn't get the attention they needed from women, weren't treated well
[02:53:45.120 --> 02:53:49.520]  in school, they weren't given the tools by their father, mostly by their parents,
[02:53:49.520 --> 02:53:55.520]  but mostly by their fathers, to know how to process the challenges of life, such that
[02:53:55.520 --> 02:53:59.680]  they have developed this hatred of themselves and this hatred of humanity.
[02:53:59.680 --> 02:54:02.960]  And now they have enough money, now that they've understood that no matter how much
[02:54:02.960 --> 02:54:06.840]  money they have, they'll never be complete inside by trying to fill that with material
[02:54:06.840 --> 02:54:07.840]  items.
[02:54:07.840 --> 02:54:13.320]  Now they're just seeking revenge, some kind of retribution against humanity itself.
[02:54:13.320 --> 02:54:17.840]  And so there's something to really pay attention to there, because I believe strongly, my wife
[02:54:17.840 --> 02:54:22.600]  and I started a school, we're deeply involved in future education for the next generations,
[02:54:22.600 --> 02:54:26.560]  we're in meetings every day about that, to try to figure out what has happened
[02:54:26.560 --> 02:54:31.540]  to our education systems, what has happened to our young people, and what is missing
[02:54:31.540 --> 02:54:36.960]  within their kind of primal upbringing that is having them, you know, it's very clear
[02:54:36.960 --> 02:54:40.260]  to know that young men have just been shamed and called toxic, and they don't know
[02:54:40.260 --> 02:54:42.040]  what their role is in life.
[02:54:42.040 --> 02:54:43.660]  They don't know their purpose.
[02:54:43.660 --> 02:54:45.920]  And a lot of that is because they weren't instilled that.
[02:54:45.920 --> 02:54:50.880]  I was raised without a father, so it took me a lot of trial and error and quite frankly
[02:54:50.880 --> 02:54:57.160]  suffering and heading down the wrong path for many years, to thank God, finally course
[02:54:57.160 --> 02:55:02.840]  correct and have my own awakening, which led me to a higher path so that I could
[02:55:02.840 --> 02:55:04.640]  be the father that I am today.
[02:55:04.640 --> 02:55:09.280]  But I truly believe that we need to pay better attention, not just more attention,
[02:55:09.280 --> 02:55:11.120]  but better attention to our children.
[02:55:11.120 --> 02:55:15.080]  So we can understand that they emulate everything that we do.
[02:55:15.080 --> 02:55:20.100]  And that if we have them understand that, you know, watching TikTok and YouTube all
[02:55:20.100 --> 02:55:25.880]  day and learning all these egoic traits of how to try to, you know, shock people
[02:55:25.880 --> 02:55:30.180]  into getting attention, there's a deficit that these young people are living out online
[02:55:30.180 --> 02:55:31.180]  right now.
[02:55:31.180 --> 02:55:34.760]  It's a deficit of love and attention and the things, the primal things that they
[02:55:34.760 --> 02:55:40.080]  need to survive a world that they understand is dangerous, they don't feel safe in
[02:55:40.080 --> 02:55:41.080]  the world.
[02:55:41.080 --> 02:55:45.640]  And so because fathers have been so rooted out of their primal role, they don't have
[02:55:45.640 --> 02:55:50.120]  that male role figure, the hunter, the gatherer to protect the child anymore, because now
[02:55:50.120 --> 02:55:54.360]  the father's told they're mean or they're toxic or they just shut up, that their
[02:55:54.360 --> 02:55:58.240]  voice has become a nuisance in the family and let the mom handle it.
[02:55:58.240 --> 02:56:02.880]  And you're just supposed to supply the home and take care of the family financially.
[02:56:02.880 --> 02:56:08.320]  The loss of that role, what we're discovering is much bigger than anyone has given
[02:56:08.320 --> 02:56:09.320]  credit.
[02:56:09.320 --> 02:56:15.580]  It's really at the root of a lot of the psychological makeup of these people that have literally
[02:56:15.580 --> 02:56:23.080]  no morals and no compassion that they can harm innocent people all in their quest
[02:56:23.080 --> 02:56:27.400]  to try to fill that deficit that they'll never fill in the way that they're trying
[02:56:27.400 --> 02:56:28.400]  to fill it.
[02:56:28.400 --> 02:56:33.240]  Well, there you go, G. Edward Griffin, the Red Pill Expo for Kids.
[02:56:33.240 --> 02:56:34.240]  When is it coming?
[02:56:34.240 --> 02:56:39.040]  It's coming August 12 and 13 in Des Moines, Iowa.
[02:56:39.040 --> 02:56:41.360]  Don't miss it.
[02:56:41.360 --> 02:56:46.560]  If you want to look it up on the website, it's redpillexpo.org.
[02:56:46.560 --> 02:56:49.760]  It's going to be one of the best, if not the best one we've had so far.
[02:56:49.760 --> 02:56:54.320]  Well, I imagine they just keep getting bigger with time as more people take the
[02:56:54.320 --> 02:56:55.320]  Red Pill.
[02:56:55.320 --> 02:56:57.660]  G. Edward Griffin, thank you for your time today.
[02:56:57.660 --> 02:56:58.660]  Mickey Willis as well.
[02:56:58.660 --> 02:57:02.160]  I know you'll be speaking at that event and people will be looking forward to hearing
[02:57:02.160 --> 02:57:03.600]  from you.
[02:57:03.600 --> 02:57:04.600]  Thank you, brother.
[02:57:04.600 --> 02:57:05.600]  Really appreciate your support.
[02:57:05.600 --> 02:57:06.600]  All right.
[02:57:06.600 --> 02:57:07.600]  There you go.
[02:57:07.600 --> 02:57:08.600]  Wow.
[02:57:09.160 --> 02:57:11.960]  G. Edward Griffin, Mickey Willis, the Alex Jones Show, knocks it out of the park yet
[02:57:11.960 --> 02:57:16.100]  again with another incredible three hours, but we got more coming up for you with
[02:57:16.100 --> 02:57:19.500]  Gerald Cilente hosting the fourth hour.
[02:57:19.500 --> 02:57:24.540]  But when we come back from the short break, I'm going to take five minutes to let you
[02:57:24.540 --> 02:57:29.080]  know what else we have coming up here at Infowars today and to just give you a little
[02:57:29.080 --> 02:57:34.840]  bit of a breaking update as far as the news with the Devin Archer testimony.
[02:57:34.840 --> 02:57:36.960]  There is some breaking news to come out of that.
[02:57:36.960 --> 02:57:40.880]  Now, you might not be surprised, but we now have total confirmation.
[02:57:40.880 --> 02:57:42.640]  Yes, Joe Biden lied.
[02:57:42.640 --> 02:57:47.280]  He was indeed talking to Hunter Biden about business.
[02:57:47.280 --> 02:57:51.880]  Tell us about the products, how we support you, how we support all of ourselves and
[02:57:51.880 --> 02:57:53.120]  the big event coming up.

[02:58:12.120 --> 02:58:17.120]  My pillow for nineteen ninety eight for the queen size, normally sixty nine ninety
[02:58:17.120 --> 02:58:18.120]  eight.
[02:58:18.120 --> 02:58:22.480]  We're celebrating our anniversary with what my employees love doing best, producing
[02:58:22.480 --> 02:58:29.240]  and making the my pillow and the model of businessmen and women with can do know how
[02:58:29.240 --> 02:58:34.120]  using the money for Americana freedom to fight the globalist is what they fear.
[02:58:34.120 --> 02:58:35.600]  That's what the banking is about.
[02:58:35.600 --> 02:58:37.400]  That's what the financial attacks are about.
[02:58:37.400 --> 02:58:41.440]  That's why we've got a rush to support my pillow dot com and info wars dot com.
[02:58:41.440 --> 02:58:47.960]  Plus, they're great products in both places because we are the tip of the spear.
[02:58:47.960 --> 02:58:54.400]  We finally have our original best selling global silver back in stock with the supply
[02:58:54.400 --> 02:58:57.000]  chain breakdowns and all the problems in the economy.
[02:58:57.000 --> 02:59:03.080]  We could not get the highest quality colloidal silver for almost three years back in stock.
[02:59:03.080 --> 02:59:06.960]  But now we've got thirty parts per million from the top lab.
[02:59:06.960 --> 02:59:07.960]  We got a limited shipment.
[02:59:07.960 --> 02:59:09.800]  Hopefully we'll have a lot of the future.
[02:59:09.800 --> 02:59:15.080]  But if you want to experience and have in your medicine cabinet, have in your preparedness
[02:59:15.080 --> 02:59:20.280]  arsenal, high quality colloidal silver from the best manufacturer, we have it right

[02:59:50.840 --> 02:59:54.920]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:59:54.920 --> 03:00:13.720]  Well, as Joe Biden is wandering around the beach, yes, wandering, wandering and wondering
[03:00:13.720 --> 03:00:20.720]  where he is, who he is, what he is, what is that, what is this as Joe Biden is wandering
[03:00:20.720 --> 03:00:23.480]  and wandering around the beach.
[03:00:23.480 --> 03:00:32.440]  Hunter Biden's top business associate, Devin Archer, was in a closed door testimony today
[03:00:32.440 --> 03:00:43.380]  with the House Oversight Committee, in which, as we suspected, he cooperated and confirmed
[03:00:43.380 --> 03:00:50.560]  that yes, indeed, Joe Biden was involved in Hunter Biden's business dealings.
[03:00:50.560 --> 03:00:54.320]  Yes indeed, Joe Biden was the big guy.
[03:00:54.320 --> 03:00:59.000]  Yes indeed, Joe Biden was making millions off of Hunter Biden's business deals, was
[03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:02.920]  running the show and knew it the entire time.
[03:01:02.920 --> 03:01:11.700]  Now, I suspect based off what we've seen, Devin Archer is not a dumb person like Hunter
[03:01:11.700 --> 03:01:13.320]  or Joe might be.
[03:01:13.320 --> 03:01:17.920]  And that's probably why they brought Devin Archer in to be their business associate, because
[03:01:17.920 --> 03:01:20.860]  he's probably a pretty smart, savvy guy.
[03:01:20.860 --> 03:01:26.660]  And my guess is, considering that he knew the situation he was in heading into this
[03:01:26.660 --> 03:01:36.040]  testimony, and maybe it was fleshed out during the testimony, maybe it got fleshed
[03:01:36.040 --> 03:01:37.200]  out behind the scenes.
[03:01:37.200 --> 03:01:43.160]  But my guess is, more or less, Devin Archer has said, look, I'll cooperate with your
[03:01:43.160 --> 03:01:47.600]  investigation and I'll give you all the details you want, but you got to give me
[03:01:47.600 --> 03:01:56.280]  a little bit of a break when the charges come down on me, more or less to put it simply.
[03:01:56.280 --> 03:02:01.300]  And when you looked at the grin Devin Archer had as he went into the building, it looked
[03:02:01.300 --> 03:02:08.280]  like the grin of a guy who was about to make some big, serious moves.
[03:02:08.280 --> 03:02:12.420]  And if that means selling out the Biden crime family to save his hide, then he would
[03:02:12.420 --> 03:02:14.080]  do just that.
[03:02:14.080 --> 03:02:20.200]  So we're starting to get some leaks now as the closed door hearing has adjourned.
[03:02:20.200 --> 03:02:24.780]  And some of the members of the House Oversight Committee have gone to the press and their
[03:02:24.780 --> 03:02:27.220]  own press, which is their Twitter accounts.
[03:02:27.220 --> 03:02:31.280]  I'm going to be covering all of that on the War Room.
[03:02:31.280 --> 03:02:37.600]  First though, this is Democrat Rep Dan Goldman, House Oversight Committee, speaking to the
[03:02:37.600 --> 03:02:40.880]  media right after the closed door hearing.
[03:02:40.880 --> 03:02:41.880]  Here's what he had to say.
[03:02:42.680 --> 03:02:46.600]  Confirmed, you're saying that the speaker phone conversations, they don't seem concerning
[03:02:46.600 --> 03:02:49.640]  to you because there is no specifics about business.
[03:02:49.640 --> 03:02:53.720]  It just seemed like it was clear that it was clear that it was part of the daily
[03:02:53.720 --> 03:02:59.300]  conversations that Hunter Biden had with his father.
[03:02:59.300 --> 03:03:06.880]  And it was and and sounded like most of the time now President Biden didn't even know
[03:03:06.880 --> 03:03:08.260]  who the people he was at dinner.
[03:03:08.260 --> 03:03:11.160]  He was just asked to say hello.
[03:03:11.160 --> 03:03:14.560]  And he would, you know, talk about the way he described it several times.
[03:03:14.560 --> 03:03:15.800]  They asked over and over and over.
[03:03:15.800 --> 03:03:21.960]  He described what the weather was, how how what's going on on your end.
[03:03:21.960 --> 03:03:29.240]  He the witness was very, very consistent that none of those conversations ever had
[03:03:29.240 --> 03:03:33.060]  to do with any business dealings or transactions.
[03:03:33.060 --> 03:03:36.960]  They were purely what he called casual conversations.
[03:03:36.960 --> 03:03:41.760]  So let's see if that is what all members of the House Oversight Committee come out
[03:03:41.760 --> 03:03:47.000]  with today, or if that's just the Democrat representative blurring the lines of what
[03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:49.640]  was really said.
[03:03:49.640 --> 03:03:53.300]  So again, though, this is all coming out right now.
[03:03:53.300 --> 03:03:56.040]  We already have the emails.
[03:03:56.040 --> 03:04:00.600]  We have new emails today that show Joe knew he was going to have conversations with Hunter
[03:04:00.600 --> 03:04:04.960]  about business, not to mention the text messages of Hunter Biden in a threatening
[03:04:04.960 --> 03:04:08.600]  fashion saying, my father's right here, where where is the money?
[03:04:08.600 --> 03:04:09.600]  Where are the payments?
[03:04:09.600 --> 03:04:12.760]  We agreed to.
[03:04:12.760 --> 03:04:16.619]  Maybe Devin Archer did go in there and just flip him the bird.
[03:04:16.619 --> 03:04:22.000]  Maybe he's been promised a pardon from Joe Biden if he did such a thing.
[03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:26.520]  Maybe that's why they DOJ was threatening to arrest him, saying, hey, we're going
[03:04:26.520 --> 03:04:31.780]  to arrest you and lock you up if you don't protect the Bidens during this hearing.
[03:04:31.780 --> 03:04:34.540]  But it doesn't matter what he said.
[03:04:34.540 --> 03:04:37.080]  We have voicemails with Joe Biden.
[03:04:37.080 --> 03:04:38.720]  We have voicemails with Hunter Biden.
[03:04:38.720 --> 03:04:40.300]  We have text messages with Hunter Biden.
[03:04:40.300 --> 03:04:42.740]  We have emails with Hunter Biden.
[03:04:42.740 --> 03:04:44.900]  Joe Biden knew all about it.
[03:04:44.900 --> 03:04:46.920]  He was getting paid by it.
[03:04:46.920 --> 03:04:50.380]  And so were multiple Biden family members.
[03:04:50.380 --> 03:04:53.340]  And so the Democrats can try to deny that.
[03:04:53.340 --> 03:04:57.980]  But the evidence is already there.
[03:04:57.980 --> 03:05:02.900]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire
[03:05:02.900 --> 03:05:04.540]  food supply.
[03:05:04.540 --> 03:05:09.380]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which
[03:05:09.380 --> 03:05:13.580]  has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[03:05:13.580 --> 03:05:16.400]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[03:05:16.400 --> 03:05:19.740]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[03:05:19.740 --> 03:05:24.960]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally
[03:05:24.960 --> 03:05:27.660]  keep the soil rich with iodine.
[03:05:27.660 --> 03:05:34.340]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day, derived from ancient
[03:05:34.340 --> 03:05:38.660]  sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface.
[03:05:38.660 --> 03:05:44.460]  Our Infowars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[03:05:44.460 --> 03:05:50.619]  Pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.

[03:06:15.780 --> 03:06:20.900]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Gerald Cilente.
[03:06:20.900 --> 03:06:26.580]  Hey, great being on The Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:27.500 --> 03:06:31.820]  And as I keep saying, do everything you can to support Infowars, because Infowars is doing
[03:06:31.820 --> 03:06:33.820]  everything they can to support you.
[03:06:33.820 --> 03:06:39.880]  You know, I was listening to Owen before coming on, and he made a comment about Joe
[03:06:39.880 --> 03:06:47.940]  Biden wandering and wandering on the beach, and the guy's out of his mind.
[03:06:47.940 --> 03:06:53.580]  I mean, and most people know it, the polls show it.
[03:06:53.580 --> 03:06:59.340]  And you got to take a look at the, the Trends Journal goes out tomorrow.
[03:06:59.340 --> 03:07:06.860]  But I mean, this is the cover of this week's Trends Journal, and we got a photograph, we
[03:07:06.860 --> 03:07:11.820]  got a thing up there of Biden and McConnell.
[03:07:11.820 --> 03:07:16.180]  The American way, left or right, they're out of their minds.
[03:07:16.180 --> 03:07:18.980]  That's it.
[03:07:19.200 --> 03:07:23.200]  You're out of their minds.
[03:07:23.400 --> 03:07:31.160]  These are the clowns running our life.
[03:07:31.160 --> 03:07:34.039]  How stupid can you be?
[03:07:34.039 --> 03:07:35.960]  I'm a repulsive kid.
[03:07:35.960 --> 03:07:37.680]  I love the Republicans.
[03:07:37.680 --> 03:07:44.840]  Look at the little clown you got running the show out of his mind.
[03:07:44.840 --> 03:07:52.279]  An arrogant little nobody stupid clown with more chins than Chinatown.
[03:07:52.279 --> 03:07:53.039]  Mitch McConnell
[03:07:53.200 --> 03:08:00.080]  Joe Biden, how about Diane Notso Feinstein?
[03:08:00.100 --> 03:08:05.300]  How about term limits?
[03:08:05.300 --> 03:08:17.180]  How about people growing up and stop swallowing the crap spewing out of the mouths of these
[03:08:17.180 --> 03:08:22.920]  out of their mind, arrogant, narcissistic, pathological liars?
[03:08:23.300 --> 03:08:26.660]  Where are you?
[03:08:26.700 --> 03:08:32.420]  Look at this guy, look at this guy!
[03:08:32.700 --> 03:08:40.420]  Biden every day! Did he fall? Did he say, oh yeah, God saved the king, God saved the
[03:08:40.420 --> 03:08:46.460]  queen. How about God saving you? Oh, you call yourself a Catholic. You are not a cow. There
[03:08:46.460 --> 03:08:52.700]  she is. Diane Notso Feinstein. Don't know what to say. Can't say yay. Can't say nay. I'm
[03:08:52.700 --> 03:09:03.300]  too out of my mind. I am not so fine. Feinstein. Yep. Sharks. Sharks.
[03:09:03.400 --> 03:09:10.760]  All throughout the country. All these little political freaks. That's why you want this
[03:09:10.760 --> 03:09:20.600]  shirt that I got on. Hey politicians. Who the F are you to tell me what to do? Hey politicians.
[03:09:20.600 --> 03:09:29.680]  Hey politicians. Yep. You go to trendsjournal.com, trendsjournal.com and you get these. Look
[03:09:29.680 --> 03:09:38.720]  at these. Look here. Joe Biden, Mitch McConnell, the leaders of their parties and you're stupid
[03:09:38.720 --> 03:09:46.160]  enough, you're stupid enough to buy into the political party crap. Oh, this is America.
[03:09:46.160 --> 03:09:55.039]  The democracy. Hey, I'm little Beto O'Rourke. I'm a little clown boy, but my daddy left me a
[03:09:55.039 --> 03:10:00.080]  lot of money. I'm going to run for governor. It's only going to cost a hundred million dollars and
[03:10:00.080 --> 03:10:11.840]  I'll lose. Oh, a democracy. Yeah. What democracy? Freedom. They stolen it from us.
[03:10:12.100 --> 03:10:21.220]  If you don't swallow government crap, there's a little arrogant boy. Look at this little
[03:10:21.220 --> 03:10:29.300]  arrogant stupid little boy. I want to be governor. I want to be president. I was on Oprah. I was
[03:10:29.300 --> 03:10:31.420]  on Oprah twice. Take it easy.
[03:10:31.500 --> 03:10:40.940]  Oh, I forgot about Stacey Abrams over there in Georgia. I got to be equal, black and white
[03:10:40.940 --> 03:10:47.660]  for moronics. Oh, yeah. She spent one hundred million dollars and lost the governor's race.
[03:10:47.700 --> 03:10:59.140]  One jerk after another telling us what to do. This is not a democracy. They've robbed
[03:10:59.140 --> 03:11:06.660]  us of our freedom. If you don't have a lot of money, you can't go to Harvard, can't go
[03:11:06.660 --> 03:11:13.700]  to Princeton, can't go to Yale, can't go to the white shoe boy schools. No, no, no, no,
[03:11:14.260 --> 03:11:20.820]  can't be a member of the club. You got to be rich. It's only a country for the rich.
[03:11:21.700 --> 03:11:28.340]  The rest of us are nothing more than plantation workers on the global plantation of slave land.
[03:11:29.000 --> 03:11:38.760]  Politics, politics, they spelt it wrong.
[03:11:38.760 --> 03:11:45.920]  Many ticks sucking off us, sucking the blood and energy and money out of our lives.
[03:11:45.920 --> 03:11:51.480]  Yeah, so I can get a job where I never have to work a day of my life.
[03:11:51.900 --> 03:11:57.420]  Look at the clown show.
[03:11:57.420 --> 03:12:00.020]  I forgot about that guy, Federman.
[03:12:00.020 --> 03:12:03.100]  Oh, that classy cat, yeah.
[03:12:03.100 --> 03:12:04.740]  Two strokes and vroom.
[03:12:04.900 --> 03:12:16.260]  Fetterman, to me, exemplifies the decline of America.
[03:12:16.260 --> 03:12:20.300]  The decline of America, his style shows it all.
[03:12:20.800 --> 03:12:29.119]  A hoodie, got a hoodie on, got short pants.
[03:12:30.700 --> 03:12:39.660]  Once upon a time, America had style and grace.
[03:12:39.660 --> 03:12:43.300]  The music, the jazz, the world loved America.
[03:12:43.400 --> 03:12:50.400]  Now, it's a clown show, you know.
[03:12:51.700 --> 03:13:01.460]  Owen before was talking about the Hunter Biden, right?
[03:13:01.600 --> 03:13:14.720]  We've been writing about the Hunter Biden scandal going back to the Obama administration
[03:13:14.720 --> 03:13:18.920]  when Biden was vice president.
[03:13:19.000 --> 03:13:35.720]  All of a sudden, this drug addict, this drug addict who his father, oh, anybody who's smoking
[03:13:35.720 --> 03:13:39.920]  a joint a couple of times, you're in jail, yeah, three strikes you're out, oh, the drug
[03:13:39.920 --> 03:13:46.440]  laws, yeah, for everybody but my drug addicted kids, yeah, that Hunter Biden from Joe Biden.
[03:13:46.500 --> 03:13:55.120]  We wrote about how, when the United States overthrew the democratically elected government
[03:13:55.120 --> 03:14:05.060]  of Viktor Yanukovych, it was in your trends journal, going back to the spring of 2014,
[03:14:05.060 --> 03:14:09.840]  when it used to be a quarterly, now it's a weekly, at the grand total of a lousy cup
[03:14:09.840 --> 03:14:18.200]  of coffee a week, $2.26 a week. So don't tell me you can't afford it. If you can't afford
[03:14:18.200 --> 03:14:23.680]  to learn, then you don't want it. But anyway, we wrote about this back then. What's this
[03:14:23.680 --> 03:14:28.880]  guy getting a job with Barisma Energy? Oh, and you know who else got a job with Barisma
[03:14:28.880 --> 03:14:36.960]  Energy? Oh yeah, that other arrogant daddy's boy, or that other arrogant daddy's boy, John
[03:14:36.960 --> 03:14:45.880]  Kerry, yeah. Another guy that's been sucking off the public, you know what, his whole life.
[03:14:45.880 --> 03:14:58.440]  His stepson, yeah, Christopher Hines, the Hines family. He got a job with Barisma Energy
[03:14:58.440 --> 03:15:02.800]  too. What do these guys say? What does Hines 57 know about energy?
[03:15:02.900 --> 03:15:12.619]  What does Biden know about energy? Oh, Burisma Energy, I think it got like, I think they're
[03:15:12.619 --> 03:15:17.960]  making like $30,000 or $40,000 a month. This is right after the United States over through
[03:15:17.960 --> 03:15:25.660]  the government. One article after another. Ukraine's Burisma, Hunter Biden's stupid,
[03:15:25.660 --> 03:15:36.859]  paid Biden's $10 million. FBI informant, Biden bride with $5 million by Burisma while VP.
[03:15:36.859 --> 03:15:41.820]  One article after another. Update, Twitter files, the Missouri versus Biden, helps spur
[03:15:41.820 --> 03:15:53.340]  a new, goes on about Burisma. One article after another. We get back when we talk more
[03:15:53.340 --> 03:15:59.840]  about this and the economy. Much more. How many times have you ever spoken to your son about
[03:15:59.840 --> 03:16:04.100]  his overseas business dealings? I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business
[03:16:04.100 --> 03:16:08.420]  dealings. So let me get this straight. The FBI was withholding from congressional oversight
[03:16:08.420 --> 03:16:12.520]  a document showing that during the Obama administration, Biden accepted a $10 million
[03:16:12.520 --> 03:16:16.560]  bribe through his son Hunter to force the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor that was
[03:16:16.560 --> 03:16:20.900]  investigating corruption, an event that Donald Trump looked into sparking the first impeachment
[03:16:20.900 --> 03:16:25.220]  enforcing the arming of Ukraine, in turn setting the stage for the current war against Russia.
[03:16:25.220 --> 03:16:30.160]  Evidence of the bribe was also in Hunter Biden's laptop, which the FBI also had,
[03:16:30.160 --> 03:16:34.980]  but that they swore was Russian disinformation and infiltrated social media to censor during the
[03:16:34.980 --> 03:16:40.020]  2020 campaign, all while the FBI investigates Trump for having classified documents despite
[03:16:40.020 --> 03:16:44.600]  the FBI admittedly letting Hillary Clinton off for a similar charge in 2016 when they
[03:16:44.600 --> 03:16:48.740]  were simultaneously launching the Russiagate investigation into Donald Trump using falsified
[03:16:48.740 --> 03:16:53.060]  evidence provided by the Clinton campaign. Do I have that all straight?
[03:17:18.740 --> 03:17:24.300]  different people. So one person might like this coffee, other person likes that coffee.
[03:17:24.300 --> 03:17:27.740]  That's how our bodies work. They're all very diverse. But we've been able to private

[03:17:57.460 --> 03:18:01.940]  iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our
[03:18:01.940 --> 03:18:07.740]  entire food supply. Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential
[03:18:07.740 --> 03:18:13.060]  trace element, which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[03:18:13.060 --> 03:18:18.100]  And there are two things we need to do about it. We need to practice more regenerative
[03:18:18.100 --> 03:18:22.539]  farming. There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and
[03:18:22.539 --> 03:18:28.100]  biodynamics that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine. And we need to
[03:18:28.100 --> 03:18:33.859]  ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day, derived from ancient
[03:18:33.859 --> 03:18:39.100]  sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface. Our info Wars

[03:19:49.500 --> 03:19:52.420]  globalists from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water
[03:19:52.420 --> 03:19:55.420]  supply. In some cases, they add the water supply like fluoride.
[03:19:55.420 --> 03:20:04.180]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[03:20:05.800 --> 03:20:26.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show. And now, your host, Gerald Cilente.
[03:20:26.160 --> 03:20:35.080]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show. And as I keep saying, because I believe it, support
[03:20:35.080 --> 03:20:39.660]  Info Wars, because they're doing everything they can to support you. You know, you think
[03:20:39.660 --> 03:20:49.279]  of the term misinformation. How dare you not swallow government crap? How dare you think
[03:20:49.279 --> 03:20:50.199]  for yourself?
[03:20:50.400 --> 03:20:58.920]  If you believe anything that they don't teach you in kindergarten for the rest of
[03:20:58.920 --> 03:21:06.279]  your life, then that's misinformation. You only have to believe what the government clowns
[03:21:06.279 --> 03:21:12.080]  are selling you and the government school system. I hated every day of school. I hated
[03:21:12.080 --> 03:21:17.160]  every day of school. They mentioned I ran away from kindergarten, four and a half years
[03:21:17.160 --> 03:21:26.760]  old. P.S. 76, that's right, in the Bronx. 76, I had the spirit of 76. I ran away, across
[03:21:26.760 --> 03:21:32.480]  the Boston Post Road. There was a major artery between New York and Boston before they built
[03:21:32.480 --> 03:21:38.560]  the heart of New York. That's how much I hated it. I hated it. I hated it. Time to
[03:21:38.560 --> 03:21:43.960]  take a nap. Taking a nap every day. I didn't want to take a nap. Gerald, it's time to
[03:21:43.960 --> 03:21:49.440]  take a nap. Be good like all the little kids and lay down like that. I can't take a nap
[03:21:49.440 --> 03:21:53.720]  now. Teacher said it's time to take a nap. Taking a nap every day. I love to take a nap.
[03:21:53.900 --> 03:21:58.900]  Next day, Ms. Rose, it's time to take a nap.
[03:21:59.100 --> 03:22:04.900]  I laid down, as soon as she turned around, shoop, I was out of there.
[03:22:04.900 --> 03:22:06.900]  We only got out of high school.
[03:22:07.000 --> 03:22:12.000]  We're still in it.
[03:22:12.000 --> 03:22:13.200]  Misinformation.
[03:22:14.300 --> 03:22:19.300]  Misinformation is thinking for yourself and looking at the facts.
[03:22:19.300 --> 03:22:23.300]  My magazine, the Trends Journal, is only filled with the data.
[03:22:23.300 --> 03:22:27.300]  Only the data that would give you our trends analysis and trend forecasting.
[03:22:27.300 --> 03:22:32.300]  So, let's go back to the magazine several weeks ago.
[03:22:32.300 --> 03:22:37.300]  It was ramping up about Ukraine's counter-offensive.
[03:22:36.900 --> 03:22:43.119]  Don't count on counter-offensive.
[03:22:43.119 --> 03:22:46.000]  And now that's the news.
[03:22:46.000 --> 03:22:48.840]  Counter-offensive isn't working as they said it would.
[03:22:48.840 --> 03:22:55.960]  And remember, they were saying since like January and the spring there's going to be
[03:22:55.960 --> 03:22:58.240]  this major counter-offensive.
[03:22:58.240 --> 03:23:05.279]  As spring is going by and then it's almost the summer and they launch their counter-offensive,
[03:23:05.279 --> 03:23:06.279]  they got nothing.
[03:23:06.279 --> 03:23:09.420]  They got like 10 miles, they just got like, you know, that's about it.
[03:23:09.500 --> 03:23:37.060]  And the lie is that in the media, coming out of that other little daddy's boy, that little arrogant daddy's boy, little Anthony Blinken, Blinken BS. Russia's lost 50%, he said. No, they haven't. They gained 20% of the country. Maybe they lost about 1%. They didn't lose 50% of what they gained.
[03:23:37.100 --> 03:23:46.940]  I'm mentioning this today. The Russians reported, and again, this is from their side, so you've
[03:23:46.940 --> 03:23:53.060]  got to think for yourself. Maria's little daddy's boy, this is an arrogant boy. Oh, look
[03:23:53.060 --> 03:23:57.820]  at the mask. A little lady with the mask on. Did Covid get you? Oh, did Covid get
[03:23:57.820 --> 03:24:03.460]  you with the mask on? No, no, no. The mask, they save your life. I got the box right
[03:24:03.460 --> 03:24:14.020]  here. I got the box right here. It says right on the box, these masks do not eliminate exposure
[03:24:14.020 --> 03:24:21.080]  to the risk of any disease or infection. But I'm a stupid little clown and I do what
[03:24:21.080 --> 03:24:29.180]  they tell me. And don't forget to masturbate. We do. Make sure you sanitize your hands.
[03:24:29.180 --> 03:24:35.620]  Remember everywhere you went, sanitizing your hands. Because when you touched anything,
[03:24:35.620 --> 03:24:42.020]  the chances of according to the data getting Covid were like 1 in 10,000. So going back
[03:24:42.020 --> 03:24:53.380]  to what we're talking about, about the counter-offensive. And you only could believe the lies that they
[03:24:53.380 --> 03:24:59.740]  were selling us. Russian forces have stopped Ukraine's counter-offensive dead in its tracks,
[03:24:59.740 --> 03:25:05.380]  inflicting tens of thousands of casualties on Kiev's troops, Russian Defence Minister Sergei
[03:25:05.380 --> 03:25:13.260]  Shugui, whatever his name is, said today. He said, Kiev is desperately throwing new forces
[03:25:13.260 --> 03:25:21.980]  in a bid to storm our positions. As a result, in July, Ukraine lost 20,824 service members,
[03:25:22.580 --> 03:25:33.940]  2,227 units of military equipment, yet stolen by them, by the government, stealing our money
[03:25:33.940 --> 03:25:42.180]  to give it to them. Oh, including 10 German leopard supply tanks, 11 USAID Bradley infantry
[03:25:42.180 --> 03:25:48.340]  vehicles, 50 self-propelled guns, blah, blah, blah, blah. It is obvious that the
[03:25:48.420 --> 03:25:52.740]  Western-supplied weapons are failing to bring success on the battlefield and only
[03:25:52.740 --> 03:25:58.780]  prolong the military conflict. As we had said from the beginning, you saw your Trends
[03:25:58.780 --> 03:26:11.580]  Journal cover over a month ago. And now Ukraine is ramping up the war by attacking Moscow,
[03:26:11.580 --> 03:26:20.620]  as they did on Sunday, or this weekend, with a drone strike into Moscow's financial district.
[03:26:20.620 --> 03:26:30.220]  So in response to that, Moscow is going to ramp up their attacks on Kiev. They're losing
[03:26:30.220 --> 03:26:38.260]  this war, but not a peep about peace. Hey, little Jakey Tapper, where your little Tapper,
[03:26:38.660 --> 03:26:44.580]  you love war. How come you don't talk about peace? I want to make this clear to everybody.
[03:26:45.300 --> 03:26:55.700]  Everybody, boys and girls, and those who call yourself men and women, if you support
[03:26:55.700 --> 03:27:07.860]  the Ukraine war, send your money over there. You go over there. Send your wife, send your
[03:27:07.940 --> 03:27:15.380]  kids, send your partners, send your transgender theys, thems. You all go over there. Put on
[03:27:15.380 --> 03:27:25.940]  your military drag. Go fight the war or shut your little gutless mouth. You're so tough
[03:27:25.940 --> 03:27:33.700]  with supporting a war that you won't fight in. And you only want to steal my money.
[03:27:34.000 --> 03:27:45.580]  World War III has already begun.
[03:27:45.580 --> 03:27:53.660]  Now Russia is talking about nuclear exchange if need be.
[03:27:53.660 --> 03:27:55.460]  On Sunday, August 8th.
[03:27:55.700 --> 03:28:07.620]  Starting at 1pm, over at the United Nations, I'll be speaking at the Humanity for Peace
[03:28:07.620 --> 03:28:08.260]  rally.
[03:28:08.300 --> 03:28:19.779]  Along with Scott Ritter and others, all you people in the New York area, please come there.
[03:28:19.900 --> 03:28:27.660]  We need a peace movement to keep going, and of course I launched Occupy Pieces, you know,
[03:28:27.660 --> 03:28:35.779]  and I have rallies. I put my money in my heart where my mouth is. Oh, I'm up here in Woodstock,
[03:28:35.779 --> 03:28:42.980]  in Woodstock. Oh yeah, oh they really do nothing to support my rallies. Yeah, I gotta
[03:28:42.980 --> 03:28:54.660]  pay to get it heard. Libtardland! Be there on Sunday. Futures in your hands.

[03:30:32.859 --> 03:30:36.699]  enemy's out in the open. We're vindicated. People are listening more than ever, but in this
[03:30:36.699 --> 03:30:41.380]  major recession going into depression and with supply chain breakdowns, I know it's hard. I know
[03:30:41.380 --> 03:30:45.220]  times are tough, so thank you for your support, but whatever you do, pray for the broadcast

[03:30:49.300 --> 03:30:52.940]  important. Let's keep this on air. So however God leads you in your heart to support us,
[03:30:52.940 --> 03:30:56.340]  please support us now, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart. God bless you.
[03:30:56.340 --> 03:31:00.260]  You wanted to plug rainforest. Do you like rainforest? Yeah. Yeah. So my name is Ken
[03:31:00.260 --> 03:31:04.420]  Heck and loudly. How do I write all the books that I do? Four books with Dr Judy
[03:31:04.420 --> 03:31:08.859]  Micovitz, four books with project Veritas, whistleblowers, and now two books with Alex
[03:31:08.859 --> 03:31:14.580]  Jones. That's because I use brain force every day. What I always need is I always
[03:31:14.580 --> 03:31:19.340]  need some sort of boost in the morning. And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat
[03:31:19.340 --> 03:31:24.580]  well, take good vitamins. But the one thing that I have really found that makes a
[03:31:24.580 --> 03:31:30.300]  difference is brain force. I'll take brain force in the morning, right before I go to my computer,
[03:31:30.300 --> 03:31:35.500]  and I'm good for the next four or five hours, writing a whole lot of stuff. So it really is
[03:31:35.500 --> 03:31:39.940]  true that brain force is something I use every day, and it helps me with my writing.
[03:31:39.940 --> 03:31:43.260]  All right, we love you. We'll be right back. Get your brain force plus brain
[03:31:43.260 --> 03:31:47.820]  force ultra and turbo force at info war store.com. We'll be right back with our number two.
[03:31:54.580 --> 03:32:01.300]  For everything the globalists hit us with, God through Mother Nature has given us the answer.
[03:32:01.300 --> 03:32:06.220]  I don't have to sell you on CBD oil, full spectrum of CBD oil, the incredible things it
[03:32:06.220 --> 03:32:11.779]  does for your nerves, your brain, your entire physiological system, for your nervous system

[03:32:28.539 --> 03:32:36.100]  Our private label name is Rebel Zen. Rebel Zen is a private label of one of the top three
[03:32:36.100 --> 03:32:40.380]  or four CBD makers in the country. It's based right here in Texas, and we're giving it to you
[03:32:40.380 --> 03:32:44.539]  at 30% off. And here's what's even crazier, 30% off of what they're selling it for.
[03:32:44.539 --> 03:32:49.380]  They're selling theirs for 30% off what their competitors are. So this is the highest rated,
[03:32:49.380 --> 03:32:55.539]  already the lowest price, not even a lower price. Rebel Zen, get yours at m4store.com now.
[03:32:55.539 --> 03:33:03.859]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:05.900 --> 03:33:33.900]  And now, your host, Gerald Cilente.
[03:33:34.900 --> 03:33:39.900]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:39.900 --> 03:33:42.900]  I look forward to it every week.
[03:33:42.900 --> 03:33:47.900]  And I look forward to it because Alex Jones and his crew,
[03:33:47.900 --> 03:33:51.900]  these guys really work hard to give you the best that they can give you.
[03:33:51.900 --> 03:33:55.900]  Every day I go to the sites with articles they're putting up there
[03:33:55.900 --> 03:33:58.900]  because a lot of them you can't find anywhere else.
[03:33:59.900 --> 03:34:03.900]  So, they're doing everything they can to inform you,
[03:34:03.900 --> 03:34:05.900]  so you do everything you can to help them.
[03:34:05.900 --> 03:34:08.900]  Anyway, week after week, they have these special sales going on
[03:34:08.900 --> 03:34:11.900]  and they got another one going on right now
[03:34:11.900 --> 03:34:15.900]  and it's right up my alley, a silver bullet.
[03:34:15.900 --> 03:34:19.900]  And they got this silver bullet that it's back
[03:34:19.900 --> 03:34:23.900]  and it's one of the top selling colloidal silver formulas
[03:34:23.900 --> 03:34:25.900]  and I'm a colloidal silver fan.
[03:34:25.900 --> 03:34:28.900]  Anytime that I feel something coming down,
[03:34:28.900 --> 03:34:32.900]  I want that colloidal silver in me and I take it frequently.
[03:34:32.900 --> 03:34:36.900]  I haven't been sick now in four years, four years.
[03:34:36.900 --> 03:34:38.900]  I used to get this cold every year.
[03:34:38.900 --> 03:34:41.900]  I'm on a whole routine of vitamins and supplements,
[03:34:41.900 --> 03:34:43.900]  feeling strong and healthy, knock on wood,
[03:34:43.900 --> 03:34:45.900]  and that's what I pray for every day
[03:34:45.900 --> 03:34:48.900]  that my health is always the number one issue of my life
[03:34:48.900 --> 03:34:50.900]  that I want to be the best.
[03:34:50.900 --> 03:34:53.900]  And so, after years of being unavailable,
[03:34:53.900 --> 03:34:57.900]  they got it back now, the silver bullet colloidal silver formula.
[03:34:57.900 --> 03:35:00.900]  It's from Infowars Life
[03:35:00.900 --> 03:35:05.900]  and they're working with one of the top colloidal silver labs in the US.
[03:35:05.900 --> 03:35:07.900]  How come you don't go to China?
[03:35:07.900 --> 03:35:08.900]  I'm only kidding.
[03:35:08.900 --> 03:35:10.900]  That's why you get it cheap.
[03:35:10.900 --> 03:35:12.900]  We don't care what it's made of.
[03:35:12.900 --> 03:35:15.900]  It's a United States lab
[03:35:15.900 --> 03:35:20.900]  and they made sure that their supplement formula is clear of additives
[03:35:21.900 --> 03:35:23.900]  and makes the most of its colloidal silver
[03:35:23.900 --> 03:35:25.900]  to bring you the greatest benefit.
[03:35:25.900 --> 03:35:27.900]  So listen, this stuff isn't going to last forever
[03:35:27.900 --> 03:35:29.900]  and either is the sale
[03:35:29.900 --> 03:35:31.900]  because you got limited stock on this.
[03:35:31.900 --> 03:35:33.900]  You only can make so much in so much amount of time.
[03:35:33.900 --> 03:35:39.900]  So go to Infowars Life silver bullet colloidal silver formula.
[03:35:39.900 --> 03:35:42.900]  It's $24.95 now before it's gone.
[03:35:42.900 --> 03:35:46.900]  Infowars Life silver bullet colloidal silver formula.
[03:35:46.900 --> 03:35:50.900]  Go to infowarsstore.com, infowarsstore.com.
[03:35:50.900 --> 03:35:53.900]  It's Patriot Pride Month, so be a proud patriot
[03:35:53.900 --> 03:35:55.900]  and support those of us that are patriots.
[03:35:55.900 --> 03:35:57.900]  And I'm a patriot.
[03:35:57.900 --> 03:35:59.900]  I am an American patriot.
[03:36:01.900 --> 03:36:04.900]  I believe in the founding fathers, no foreign entanglements.
[03:36:04.900 --> 03:36:05.900]  Like George Washington said,
[03:36:05.900 --> 03:36:08.900]  this crap has been going on in Europe for centuries.
[03:36:08.900 --> 03:36:09.900]  We don't get involved in it.
[03:36:09.900 --> 03:36:12.900]  Basically, that's what he said, read his farewell address.
[03:36:12.900 --> 03:36:15.900]  And if we don't stop it, it's going to be farewell to all of us
[03:36:15.900 --> 03:36:17.900]  because we're going to die in a nuclear war.
[03:36:19.900 --> 03:36:21.900]  And again, talking about Infowars,
[03:36:21.900 --> 03:36:24.900]  one of the articles about freedom
[03:36:24.900 --> 03:36:27.900]  and you're only allowed to repeat the crap.
[03:36:27.900 --> 03:36:28.900]  Can you imagine?
[03:36:28.900 --> 03:36:30.900]  You're only allowed to repeat the crap
[03:36:30.900 --> 03:36:33.900]  that the government says you should swallow.
[03:36:34.900 --> 03:36:37.900]  So one of the articles in this week's Trends Journal
[03:36:37.900 --> 03:36:39.900]  that will be out tomorrow.
[03:36:39.900 --> 03:36:41.900]  Last week's, by the way, was almost 200 pages.
[03:36:41.900 --> 03:36:43.900]  No ads, no ads.
[03:36:43.900 --> 03:36:44.900]  And you read what you want.
[03:36:44.900 --> 03:36:46.900]  You can listen to it too.
[03:36:46.900 --> 03:36:50.900]  And again, it's only $2.86 a week, nothing.
[03:36:51.900 --> 03:36:53.900]  So you go to trendsjournal.com.
[03:36:53.900 --> 03:36:57.900]  But anyway, one of the articles is Facebook America.
[03:36:57.900 --> 03:37:01.900]  And we spell America, M-A-M-E-R-I-K-A.
[03:37:01.900 --> 03:37:05.900]  Silence the people, only believe the government's COVID war.
[03:37:05.900 --> 03:37:08.900]  Facebook executives conspired to silence debate
[03:37:08.900 --> 03:37:13.900]  on the origins of the COVID-19 outbreak
[03:37:14.900 --> 03:37:17.900]  after being pressured by the Biden administration.
[03:37:17.900 --> 03:37:19.900]  Now what right wing?
[03:37:20.500 --> 03:37:28.700]  Anti-government conspiracy theorist said that.
[03:37:28.800 --> 03:37:34.800]  According to a report in the Wall Street Journal last week.
[03:37:34.800 --> 03:37:40.800]  Oh yeah, no kidding. Can't you see what's going on here?
[03:37:40.800 --> 03:37:50.359]  Our freedom is gone. And along with the loss of freedom is the loss of dignity. And that's
[03:37:50.359 --> 03:37:56.160]  how low America is sunk. It's a freak show out there. Oh yes, you look at the cover of
[03:37:56.160 --> 03:38:02.480]  this week's Trends Journal. America is suffering from blimpitis. We're number one. Oh, those
[03:38:02.480 --> 03:38:06.320]  are the people, by the way, that were dying the most of COVID too. Oh, don't believe
[03:38:06.320 --> 03:38:13.840]  me. Believe the CDC. Sixty-one percent of the 17-year-olds that were hospitalized for COVID
[03:38:13.840 --> 03:38:20.640]  were obese. Oh, that terrible COVID. Hey, how about all of that weight that's killing you?
[03:38:20.640 --> 03:38:26.599]  You know, America's talking about getting a war with China, Russia. This country's too
[03:38:26.599 --> 03:38:33.080]  fat to fight. Bring the transgenders in. Oh, they're tough.
[03:38:33.080 --> 03:38:40.960]  Before we keep going, I want to mention the economy real quick here. Again, the Fed raised
[03:38:40.960 --> 03:38:45.599]  rates last week. This is a very simple game. The higher the rates go, the more things are
[03:38:45.599 --> 03:38:51.279]  going to slow down. It takes time. You're already seeing Italy, Austria, other countries
[03:38:51.279 --> 03:38:55.420]  in a recession over in Europe, and they're talking about raising rates again. They raised
[03:38:55.420 --> 03:39:02.140]  them on Thursday. Germany's officially in a recession already. The Chinese economy is
[03:39:02.140 --> 03:39:07.740]  in the crapper because those are the crapheads that began the COVID war. Launched it on
[03:39:07.740 --> 03:39:13.420]  Chinese Lunar New Year 2020, the year of the rat, January. And then Italy was
[03:39:13.420 --> 03:39:17.500]  the first one to follow. Oh, your economy's in a recession. Can't understand why. You
[03:39:17.500 --> 03:39:20.619]  made it never bounce back? Oh, it'll come back. It'll come back.
[03:39:20.900 --> 03:39:29.100]  China's economy, I was saying that the 21st century be the Chinese century because the
[03:39:29.100 --> 03:39:40.020]  business is China's business. The men, or I can't say man, but they, they them, the men,
[03:39:40.020 --> 03:39:45.580]  they destroyed their country with their COVID war, zero COVID policy. They destroyed the
[03:39:45.580 --> 03:39:51.060]  lives and livelihoods of hundreds of millions throughout that country. It's not going to
[03:39:51.060 --> 03:39:56.300]  come back. The businesses that go out of business are out of business. By the way, RFK Jr. on
[03:39:56.300 --> 03:40:02.060]  Fox was repeating what we've been saying, that these lockdowns have destroyed businesses
[03:40:02.060 --> 03:40:07.020]  and kill lives around the country. And we've been writing about it in detail since
[03:40:07.020 --> 03:40:12.340]  it happened. Again, the Trends Journal was the first magazine, the first to call
[03:40:12.340 --> 03:40:18.580]  the coronavirus a fraud. If you go back to our January 28th, you could go to the website,
[03:40:18.580 --> 03:40:22.020]  January 28th, 2020, trendsjournal.com.
[03:40:22.100 --> 03:40:33.700]  Less than two weeks after the COVID war broke out in China, coronavirus, 106 dead in China.
[03:40:33.700 --> 03:40:38.220]  Our next line was 1.4 billion still alive and what are you telling me?
[03:40:38.500 --> 03:40:44.660]  So, going on to this, it's all connected with the economy.
[03:40:44.700 --> 03:40:49.180]  There's a very simple formula here.
[03:40:49.180 --> 03:40:53.900]  They're going to start lowering interest rates.
[03:40:53.900 --> 03:40:59.500]  When they do, the dollar will weaken, the dollar is only strong because of high interest
[03:40:59.500 --> 03:41:00.500]  rates.
[03:41:00.500 --> 03:41:03.460]  We've got a 32 trillion dollar debt.
[03:41:03.460 --> 03:41:08.820]  Oh, and the more high the interest rates, the more you've got to pay on the debt.
[03:41:08.820 --> 03:41:12.940]  And then we have the commercial building bust, but that's a whole other story.
[03:41:12.940 --> 03:41:18.140]  So when they start lowering interest rates, the dollar goes down and gold prices will go
[03:41:18.140 --> 03:41:19.980]  up.
[03:41:19.980 --> 03:41:22.540]  That is our forecast.
[03:41:22.540 --> 03:41:26.460]  And as to the stock market, it's summertime.
[03:41:26.460 --> 03:41:29.500]  It's summertime and the living is easy.
[03:41:29.500 --> 03:41:34.980]  You spread your wings and you make to the sky.
[03:41:34.980 --> 03:41:39.100]  So people are in a summer state of mind, they don't know what's going on.
[03:41:39.100 --> 03:41:42.620]  The market's artificial game, artificial game.
[03:41:42.700 --> 03:41:50.700]  People are going to be spending more now, and then around, we're forecasting the end
[03:41:50.700 --> 03:41:54.940]  of September, October, you're going to see the market's going down.
[03:41:54.940 --> 03:42:00.460]  Again, we'd forecast that we go down in March, and they did, and we're forecasting, again,
[03:42:00.460 --> 03:42:06.100]  we'd also forecast that the S&P 500 would go up at least 16.3%.
[03:42:06.100 --> 03:42:09.100]  We said that last November, it's up almost 19%.
[03:42:09.100 --> 03:42:10.300]  So that's peaking as well.
[03:42:10.400 --> 03:42:19.680]  So you better prepare and stay tuned. And Infowars is helping you stay tuned and we're
[03:42:19.680 --> 03:42:24.440]  doing everything we can with the Trends Journal. There's no magazine in the world like it. They
[03:42:24.440 --> 03:42:31.279]  give you geopolitical, economic, socioeconomic, on and on, high-tech, AI, AI, we own you.
[03:42:31.279 --> 03:42:35.500]  So you better prepare. We're going to head into very rough territory. But going back
[03:42:35.500 --> 03:42:39.920]  to the Ukraine war, nuclear war, as I say, don't worry, when all else fails, they take
[03:42:39.960 --> 03:42:47.880]  you to war. Get your mind right off problems you have in life. Again, do everything you
[03:42:47.880 --> 03:42:53.880]  can to support peace. Put your money where your heart and mind is. Be right back.
[03:43:09.920 --> 03:43:19.920]  We have the strongest, best CBD oil you're going to find anywhere at the lowest price.
[03:43:19.920 --> 03:43:26.920]  Yes, you can find this same CBD oil for 30% more because that's who we're getting it from,
[03:43:26.920 --> 03:43:34.920]  made right here in Central Texas. Our private label name is Rebel Zen. Rebel Zen is a private
[03:43:34.920 --> 03:43:39.920]  label of one of the top three or four CBD makers in the country. It's based right here
[03:43:39.920 --> 03:43:43.920]  in Texas and we're giving it to you at 30% off. And here's what's even crazier, 30%
[03:43:43.920 --> 03:43:47.920]  off of what they're selling it for. They're selling theirs for 30% off what their
[03:43:47.920 --> 03:43:51.920]  competitors are. So this is the highest rated, already the lowest price, now even
[03:43:51.920 --> 03:43:56.920]  a lower price. Rebel Zen, get yours at infowarsstore.com now.
[03:43:56.920 --> 03:44:05.920]  I want to say Brain Force is great. I want to say Turbo Force is amazing. It is.
[03:44:05.920 --> 03:44:11.920]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it. The fish oil is better than it.
[03:44:11.920 --> 03:44:17.920]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about. Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart,
[03:44:17.920 --> 03:44:21.920]  the cleanest, the best out there. Krill oil is the best and it'll give you the damn burps.
[03:44:21.920 --> 03:44:24.920]  And I'm sorry, you want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[03:44:24.920 --> 03:44:29.920]  The krill is hallucinogenic. It's so good in my view. I'm not making a medical statement here,
[03:44:29.920 --> 03:44:32.920]  but let me tell you something. I eat five caplets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[03:44:32.920 --> 03:44:43.920]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night. So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[03:44:43.920 --> 03:44:46.920]  So we don't make a big profit off of it. But you know, as I just obsessed,
[03:44:46.920 --> 03:44:49.920]  because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[03:44:49.920 --> 03:44:52.920]  I just can't do it.
[03:44:55.920 --> 03:45:01.920]  Tell us about the products, how we support you, how we support all of ourselves and the big event coming up.
[03:45:01.920 --> 03:45:06.920]  Well, yeah, let's the first one you obviously go to my pillow dot com.

[03:45:17.920 --> 03:45:24.920]  And there's the biggest special we have right now, the 20 year anniversary my pillow for nineteen ninety eight for the queen size.
[03:45:24.920 --> 03:45:30.920]  Normally sixty nine ninety eight. We're celebrating our anniversary with what my employees love doing best,
[03:45:30.920 --> 03:45:38.920]  producing and making the my pillow and the model of businessmen and women with can do know how.
[03:45:38.920 --> 03:45:42.920]  Using the money for Americana freedom to fight the globalist is what they fear.
[03:45:42.920 --> 03:45:46.920]  That's what the banking is about. That's what the financial attacks are about.
[03:45:46.920 --> 03:45:50.920]  That's why we've got a rush to support my billa dot com and infowars dot com.
[03:45:50.920 --> 03:45:56.920]  Plus, they're great products both places because we are the tip of the spear.
[03:45:56.920 --> 03:46:05.920]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia, the insanity, the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy.
[03:46:05.920 --> 03:46:11.920]  You are crazy, in my view, if you don't get high quality, horrible food and water filtration and self-defense.
[03:46:11.920 --> 03:46:13.920]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[03:46:13.920 --> 03:46:16.920]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[03:46:16.920 --> 03:46:22.920]  And I'm preaching the choir on that. But a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough durable food or water filtration.
[03:46:22.920 --> 03:46:29.920]  This is something you need now. And we've got it in the food department and in the high quality water filtration department.
[03:46:29.920 --> 03:46:32.920]  The highest quality food, the best water filtration at the lowest prices.
[03:46:32.920 --> 03:46:42.920]  You're going to find and still get quality info war store dot com running a special right now for 10 percent off on all storeable food and on water and air filtration.
[03:46:42.920 --> 03:46:47.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot beat this deal. Our prices are already the lowest at 10 percent off.
[03:46:47.920 --> 03:46:53.920]  It's an insane deal for a limited time. Go to info war store dot com and get prepared while you still can.
[03:46:56.100 --> 03:47:03.100]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:06.200 --> 03:47:25.200]  Waging war on corruption, it's Gerald Cilente. You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:25.200 --> 03:47:33.200]  Hey, great being on The Alex Jones Show. And as I said, do everything you can to support
[03:47:33.200 --> 03:47:37.200]  info laws because they're doing everything they can to support you.
[03:47:37.200 --> 03:47:43.200]  Now, I was talking about the economy before. You're seeing Brent Crude. Yeah, it's been
[03:47:43.200 --> 03:47:51.200]  going up pretty sharp. It's about almost $85 a barrel now. Two weeks ago, it was around
[03:47:51.200 --> 03:47:57.200]  $70 a barrel. So the prices at the pump are going to go up, and it's summertime
[03:47:57.200 --> 03:48:04.200]  and people are traveling more. So that means demand is going to go up. So all this BS they're
[03:48:04.200 --> 03:48:09.200]  giving you about inflation going down is nothing more than that. Again, we write the facts.
[03:48:09.200 --> 03:48:21.200]  So you're seeing companies like Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola, Unilever, all saying that their
[03:48:21.200 --> 03:48:27.200]  profits have gone up. Volume has gone down, but they keep raising the prices. So all
[03:48:27.200 --> 03:48:32.200]  this BS that they're giving you about, oh, inflation numbers are falling is nothing
[03:48:32.200 --> 03:48:40.200]  more than BS. What's your median cost of a home in America? A little over $400,000.
[03:48:40.700 --> 03:48:46.660]  So, if they go down 5%, what are we talking about?
[03:48:46.900 --> 03:48:51.300]  How's your car insurance?
[03:48:51.300 --> 03:48:53.779]  Oh, it's going up.
[03:48:53.779 --> 03:48:55.380]  Home insurance, so that went up too.
[03:48:55.380 --> 03:48:56.380]  We won't count that though.
[03:48:56.380 --> 03:48:57.140]  Don't worry about that.
[03:48:57.200 --> 03:49:01.560]  Alright, so corn went down.
[03:49:01.600 --> 03:49:11.840]  So, yes, inflation is easing in the sense that it's not going up as fast as it was.
[03:49:11.900 --> 03:49:16.289]  But it's still very high.
[03:49:16.300 --> 03:49:17.119]  So you're paying a lot more to buy a lot less. Oh, and the cost, the average cost of going to a private college? Only $40,000 a year. Oh, but that's cheaper than buying a stupid automobile with all this electronic crap in it. That costs, on average, $50,000 a year. But inflation's coming down.
[03:49:41.900 --> 03:49:53.060]  $50,000, you used to be able to buy a house and more when I was a kid.
[03:49:55.300 --> 03:50:04.340]  So, I want to talk about something, first of all, a couple of things, again, about the
[03:50:04.340 --> 03:50:05.340]  markets.
[03:50:05.340 --> 03:50:07.580]  I gave you the insights of where they're going.
[03:50:07.700 --> 03:50:17.340]  But they're wildcards. I mentioned oil prices. What's going on in the Middle East with the
[03:50:17.340 --> 03:50:18.540]  Netanyahu government...
[03:50:18.700 --> 03:50:27.700]  It's a civil war going on in that country. A lot of people avoid judicial reform, and a lot of people are against it.
[03:50:27.700 --> 03:50:32.700]  And this is the 30th week where they've taken to the streets.
[03:50:32.700 --> 03:50:36.700]  As I say, when all else fails, they take you to war.
[03:50:36.700 --> 03:50:43.700]  To get the people's mind off of what's going on, if Netanyahu does what they do all the time...
[03:50:43.100 --> 03:50:53.100]  ...ramps up war with bad. Doesn't matter with Palestine, they could kill as many as they want, nobody cares.
[03:50:53.100 --> 03:50:56.100]  Same with Lebanon, but Lebanon may get a little more ferocious.
[03:50:56.400 --> 03:51:10.840]  But Iran, military conflict breaks out between Israel and Iran, you're going to see oil prices
[03:51:10.840 --> 03:51:18.520]  go over $130 a barrel, that will crash the global economy and will crash the equity markets
[03:51:18.520 --> 03:51:22.560]  that are artificially propped up.
[03:51:22.560 --> 03:51:26.840]  So you've got a lot of wildcards and the other wildcard, of course, is the Ukraine War.
[03:51:26.840 --> 03:51:32.800]  And again, I'm telling you things that get done with what they're reporting.
[03:51:32.900 --> 03:51:41.180]  Ukraine President Vladimir Zelensky said war is returning to Russia's territory. Oh,
[03:51:41.180 --> 03:51:46.140]  great. Kremlin threatened to use nuclear weapons against Ukraine in the wake of a series of
[03:51:46.140 --> 03:51:53.220]  drone strikes within Moscow's city center on Monday. From the Daily Mail, Moscow said
[03:51:53.220 --> 03:51:58.859]  it brought down three Ukrainian drones early on Sunday that had been trying to attack
[03:51:58.859 --> 03:52:05.140]  the capital. It also claimed that forces had thwarted the Ukrainian attempt to attack Russian
[03:52:05.140 --> 03:52:11.140]  annexed Crimea with 25 drones overnight. I mean, this stuff is here.
[03:52:11.200 --> 03:52:17.040]  Yep.
[03:52:17.100 --> 03:52:22.100]  So.
[03:52:22.300 --> 03:52:31.580]  Those are the kind of wildcards that could, you know, throw things off the scale.
[03:52:31.580 --> 03:52:33.539]  I want to talk what's going on in Niger.
[03:52:33.600 --> 03:52:39.060]  Nobody knows about this.
[03:52:39.060 --> 03:52:41.060]  They just had a coup.
[03:52:41.060 --> 03:52:44.820]  I forget how many people there, but I'm going to guess, it's like you get back 40 million
[03:52:44.820 --> 03:52:45.820]  53.
[03:52:45.820 --> 03:52:49.740]  It's a pretty big country, very poor, one of the poorest countries.
[03:52:49.740 --> 03:52:53.620]  And France has been colonizing it now for a long time.
[03:52:53.620 --> 03:52:59.380]  And again, we wrote in our trends journal when France was the one, the leaders that
[03:52:59.380 --> 03:53:09.680]  overthrew the leader of Libya, the richest country in Africa at the time.
[03:53:09.680 --> 03:53:13.580]  Also brought to you by, if only women were in charge, Samantha Power, Susan Rice and
[03:53:13.580 --> 03:53:20.460]  Hillary Clinton, and that little slimeball lowlife, that little arrogant, arrogant little
[03:53:20.460 --> 03:53:24.780]  boy over there in France, yeah, he was the one that pushed it the hardest.
[03:53:24.900 --> 03:53:33.460]  They said that they were going to go on the gold standard for Europe, for Africa, and
[03:53:33.460 --> 03:53:41.900]  that was one of the reasons. But anyway, they destroyed the richest country in Africa. People
[03:53:41.900 --> 03:53:47.100]  had more rights and benefits in Libya than they did in a lot of the world. But now it's
[03:53:47.100 --> 03:53:56.500]  a hell hole going back to Niger. What happened was when Gaddafi was in, things were cooled
[03:53:56.500 --> 03:54:07.380]  out in Niger and Mali and other areas around there. They had thrown out the colonists.
[03:54:07.380 --> 03:54:15.900]  And then when Libya fell, again, we wrote about this as it was happening, they started
[03:54:15.900 --> 03:54:20.220]  going back into these countries. And another arrogant little boy, again, you look at the
[03:54:20.220 --> 03:54:26.820]  stupid little jerks, not only the cover of the Trends Journal with Biden and McConnell,
[03:54:26.820 --> 03:54:35.140]  that little holland back there in France, I think it was 2012, late 2011, 2012, when
[03:54:35.140 --> 03:54:42.800]  he goes back into Mali. You know why they were over there? France is one of the most
[03:54:42.800 --> 03:54:53.960]  nuclear-generating energy countries in the world. And Niger is rich in uranium. And
[03:54:53.960 --> 03:55:03.680]  Niger is supplying Ukraine with 15% at least of its uranium needs so they can run their
[03:55:03.680 --> 03:55:06.800]  nuclear power plants. And they're getting it cheap.
[03:55:07.100 --> 03:55:14.940]  So they're all against the coup. And Europe is against it too. They get about 20%. Oh,
[03:55:14.940 --> 03:55:20.420]  the good news now, Canada is going to be building nuclear power plants. Oh, and they're so
[03:55:20.420 --> 03:55:29.940]  safe. Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, Fukushima. You better put a C in that, Fuka, put a C
[03:55:29.940 --> 03:55:36.600]  in there, Shima. Yeah. Oh, they're dumping all that poison water now back into the ocean
[03:55:36.640 --> 03:55:44.880]  and the people in Korea and Japan and China, you're all so happy that they're going to be poisoning
[03:55:44.880 --> 03:55:47.320]  the water, that uranium.
[03:55:47.500 --> 03:55:54.900]  I'm going to read to you from Euronews. They don't mention one word about what I just
[03:55:54.900 --> 03:56:02.240]  told you about the uranium. France warns attacks on its interests in Niger will not
[03:56:02.240 --> 03:56:11.660]  be tolerated. Hey, what interests do you have over there? The joint is in Africa. You have
[03:56:11.660 --> 03:56:19.660]  no interest over there? Oh, you murderous French did a great job. Oh yeah, in Algeria,
[03:56:19.660 --> 03:56:29.900]  they loved you in Morocco. Oh, I forgot French Indochina. You murderous French. You're most
[03:56:29.900 --> 03:56:36.700]  as bad as the Americans and the British. Oh, but that rotten Putin. Anyway, what interests
[03:56:36.700 --> 03:56:43.220]  do you have there? Protestors vandalized the French embassy after military junta moved
[03:56:43.220 --> 03:56:50.500]  to seize. Emmanuel Macron, the little gatsone, the little boy with the fake hair and a little
[03:56:50.500 --> 03:56:55.460]  thing like that. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. A Rothschild's boy, a little clown of nothing
[03:56:55.460 --> 03:57:03.380]  said, quote, we will not tolerate any attack against France and its interests in
[03:57:03.380 --> 03:57:09.980]  Niger. What interests do you got over there? It's not your country. It's not your country.
[03:57:10.300 --> 03:57:23.099]  France, Paris will, quote, immediately and uncompromisingly react. The French government
[03:57:23.099 --> 03:57:31.740]  said on Sunday, quote, anyone attacking French nationals, why don't you get out of there?
[03:57:31.740 --> 03:57:43.539]  The army, what are you doing over there? Retaliate immediately and intractably. Yep, you got
[03:57:43.539 --> 03:57:49.619]  1,500 soldiers there. All right. You're going to want to pay attention to what I'm about
[03:57:49.619 --> 03:57:55.140]  to say in the next 60 seconds. Two new incredible products are now available exclusively at
[03:57:55.140 --> 03:58:01.019]  mfullwarstore.com. They are both clones of national best selling products from a major
[03:58:01.019 --> 03:58:05.340]  pharmaceutical slash supplement maker that are listeners and patriots that are allowing
[03:58:05.340 --> 03:58:11.699]  us to private label it at a lower price you'll find in stores. It's Joint Relief Max and
[03:58:11.699 --> 03:58:19.259]  Nerve Renew. Both of these have known documented natural compounds to lower pain and to also
[03:58:19.259 --> 03:58:24.119]  make your nerves healthier, which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated
[03:58:24.119 --> 03:58:28.939]  and are more inductive to pain. There's major research behind this all. You need
[03:58:28.939 --> 03:58:35.939]  to get Joint Relief Max from Mfull Wars MD and Nerve Renew from Mfull Wars MD exclusively
[03:58:35.939 --> 03:58:42.220]  at mfullwarstore.com right now. Introducing them both 25% off. You'll find them exclusively
[03:58:42.220 --> 03:58:49.859]  at mfullwarstore.com and they fund our operation. Hydrofluorosilic acid is the third
[03:58:49.859 --> 03:58:57.099]  most deadly acid on earth and they've got our children drinking that. This is a psychotic
[03:58:57.099 --> 03:59:02.779]  death cult, period, case closed, out to get you and your family. We shelved the Alexa
[03:59:02.779 --> 03:59:07.179]  Pure Breeze made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour group. It's been around about
[03:59:07.179 --> 03:59:10.900]  15 years, became the biggest company in the last six. They went out, hired engineers,
[03:59:10.900 --> 03:59:14.900]  reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the
[03:59:14.900 --> 03:59:20.699]  price and they made it as good in all the studies. It reduces things to non-detectable
[03:59:20.699 --> 03:59:24.259]  levels, thousands of chemicals. But you can go pay two or three times. There's four
[03:59:24.259 --> 03:59:28.660]  or five other filters out there that are just as good. We sell the very best, highest
[03:59:28.660 --> 03:59:33.019]  grade water filtration system for half the price of leading competitor and the media
[03:59:33.019 --> 03:59:37.660]  says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water. You should
[03:59:37.660 --> 03:59:41.220]  also filter your shower water. That's another way you absorb this crap. But I'm done
[03:59:41.220 --> 03:59:44.980]  talking about that. The point is you can get the filters at mfullwarstore.com. They're
[03:59:44.980 --> 03:59:52.980]  discounted right now. Finally back in stock. If you are receiving this transmission,
[03:59:52.980 --> 03:59:54.539]  you are the resistance.
