[00:00.000 --> 00:09.360]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so
[00:09.360 --> 00:33.360]  does he? It's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[00:39.360 --> 00:53.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live worldwide on this Wednesday, July 14,
[00:53.960 --> 01:03.920]  2010 edition. This is the most important broadcast I have ever done in my 15 years
[01:03.920 --> 01:10.040]  of transmission. The most important broadcast I have ever done except for
[01:10.040 --> 01:16.640]  maybe my 9-11 2001 transmission when I laid it all on the line when nobody else
[01:16.640 --> 01:23.520]  would and told it like it was. You have epiphanies, you have basically
[01:23.520 --> 01:27.240]  brainstorms, moments where you realize that you've been right about everything
[01:27.240 --> 01:33.800]  and the picture that was already clear becomes crystal clear, crystal clear.
[01:33.800 --> 01:42.040]  I'm gonna say this succinctly. There is a 100% chance that the United States
[01:42.040 --> 01:50.520]  will completely collapse into a road warrior-like scenario if we do not
[01:50.520 --> 01:56.840]  address the problems now and point out that this is being engineered by design.
[01:56.840 --> 02:02.760]  Now this road warrior collapse will only go on for a few years. It is being
[02:02.760 --> 02:07.800]  orchestrated to fully break the United States. This is a economic slash military
[02:07.800 --> 02:12.800]  coup d'etat not just against the United States but against the entire Western
[02:12.800 --> 02:17.240]  world. The globalists have already destroyed and leveled and annihilated
[02:17.240 --> 02:20.680]  and decimated the third world and it's all been declassified at the IMF and
[02:20.680 --> 02:24.520]  World Bank, bragged in their internal memos that they have orchestrated it.
[02:24.520 --> 02:30.000]  They are doing the exact same thing here but with a 21st century high-tech
[02:30.000 --> 02:39.240]  overlay. This is a mega 100% red alert, ladies and gentlemen, red alert. We could
[02:39.240 --> 02:45.680]  go into the full collapse as early as next year, perhaps even sooner, but within
[02:45.680 --> 02:53.480]  the next two years it is a 100% guaranteed fact that this society is
[02:53.480 --> 02:59.000]  completely collapsing by design and then what they have to offer after they've
[02:59.000 --> 03:02.880]  engineered the collapse and they've trained people to fully submit and
[03:02.880 --> 03:09.720]  accept a new way of life living under the boot of the new world order. It is so
[03:09.720 --> 03:14.000]  important what we are going to be covering today. Larry Pratt's joining us
[03:14.000 --> 03:17.400]  on the Second Amendment front for 30 minutes later. Richard Reeves for 30
[03:17.400 --> 03:21.360]  minutes in studio dealing with the Napa superhighways and the toll roads that
[03:21.360 --> 03:24.720]  they're putting in all over the nation. In the last few years there's been
[03:24.720 --> 03:27.680]  massive resistance to it so they played possum and claimed that they weren't
[03:27.680 --> 03:30.840]  going to do it. Now they're back with the vengeance. This is a key part of the
[03:30.840 --> 03:37.160]  globalist funding mechanism worldwide. We'll be exposing that coming up as well.
[03:37.160 --> 03:40.520]  So you'll definitely want to stay with us for Richard Reeves in the middle of the
[03:40.520 --> 03:44.360]  next hour then Larry Pratt joining us at the beginning of the third hour. But I
[03:44.360 --> 03:50.360]  want to be extremely clear with everyone here today. Here are just some of the
[03:50.360 --> 03:55.880]  data points. When we come back from break I'm going to break down and explain
[03:55.880 --> 03:59.960]  why I've come to this realization. Number one the mainstream media is talking
[03:59.960 --> 04:04.120]  about total complete collapse worse than the Great Depression everywhere. Of
[04:04.120 --> 04:06.800]  course they've been engineering this. They hid that fact from you for the last
[04:06.800 --> 04:10.640]  few years as we told you they would. But before they fully collapse our nation
[04:10.640 --> 04:13.920]  into the world government that they would announce it. That is now happening.
[04:13.920 --> 04:17.480]  This is just the last day and a half. Central banks start to abandon the US
[04:17.480 --> 04:22.920]  dollar and who could blame them is the quote singing in London telegraph
[04:22.920 --> 04:28.080]  Chinese rating agency strips Western nations of triple A status. Both parties
[04:28.080 --> 04:33.640]  mole raising retirement age Washington Times crisis awaits World Bank's
[04:33.640 --> 04:38.440]  trillions come to the big crash America plunges into depression. This is all
[04:38.440 --> 04:42.520]  mainstream news in your face that dovetails with all these police
[04:42.520 --> 04:46.560]  departments announcing that they're not going to stop people for assault for
[04:46.560 --> 04:51.960]  poisoning for robbery for burglary. I'm going to explain what's happening and the
[04:51.960 --> 04:56.560]  most important information when we come back. Here's the headline top Clinton
[04:56.560 --> 05:01.560]  official I'm getting chills only a terror attack can save Obama. Get ready. This is
[05:01.560 --> 05:04.960]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[05:04.960 --> 05:08.880]  generator. Number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[05:08.880 --> 05:13.160]  triple your electric bill. Number two our new energies are wants to control how
[05:13.160 --> 05:17.440]  much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government
[05:17.440 --> 05:21.800]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number
[05:21.800 --> 05:25.720]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[05:25.720 --> 05:30.480]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four
[05:30.480 --> 05:34.560]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year thousands of
[05:34.560 --> 05:38.520]  families lose their power from weather related onages. Number five a solar power
[05:38.520 --> 05:42.360]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks I
[05:42.360 --> 05:45.040]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from
[05:45.040 --> 05:51.080]  Science. One of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com

[08:33.280 --> 08:38.840]  months probably even sooner that's conservative if we do not realize the
[08:38.840 --> 08:44.260]  fight we're in if we do not face the enemy that is coming down on us hard
[08:44.260 --> 08:49.640]  core I want to make something clear here Barack Obama is a puppet Barack Obama
[08:49.640 --> 08:56.720]  is a wicked scapegoat Barack Obama is a Harvard CIA a frontman lawyer Barack
[08:56.720 --> 09:04.000]  Obama was designed for the implosion that you are now seeing understand that
[09:04.000 --> 09:08.960]  the system knows there's a complete global realignment against tyranny they
[09:08.960 --> 09:12.280]  know there's a worldwide awakening against the new world order their own
[09:12.280 --> 09:16.520]  policy reports and Zbigniew Brzezinski admit that and they are going to try to
[09:16.520 --> 09:22.120]  play the tea parties the populist the constitutional populist off against the
[09:22.120 --> 09:28.320]  dumb-down TV heads and basically distract us while they establish this world
[09:28.320 --> 09:32.720]  government that will be built out of the ashes of the worldwide depression that
[09:32.720 --> 09:36.760]  they've engineered the end of the dollar is the world reserve currency the end of
[09:36.760 --> 09:41.440]  our borders the North American Union it's all in the SPP security prosperity
[09:41.440 --> 09:46.920]  partnership documents that were released in 2007 via the four-year lawsuit by
[09:46.920 --> 09:52.000]  judicial watch now the data points are the media is now admitting we're going
[09:52.000 --> 09:56.480]  in to a depression all over the nation the announcements are being made that
[09:56.480 --> 10:01.400]  basic essential services from potholes to roads to police are just going to be
[10:01.400 --> 10:05.360]  shut off this is the same thing that's been done in the third world over and
[10:05.360 --> 10:09.280]  over again via the IMF World Bank receivership it's called shock therapy
[10:09.280 --> 10:13.200]  doctrine we have the internal IMF World Bank documents 2000 pages that were
[10:13.200 --> 10:19.200]  leaked in 2002 BBC Greg Palace covered it we know exactly what they are going to
[10:19.200 --> 10:24.080]  do they will jack up the taxes but cut out all the services they will at least
[10:24.080 --> 10:28.520]  triple the prices of water they will put toll roads on every major road 8,000
[10:28.520 --> 10:33.800]  road miles of road in Texas is their announcement just as a microcosm example
[10:33.800 --> 10:37.840]  this is hellish what they're going to do they're suddenly massively increasing
[10:37.840 --> 10:42.680]  water prices and privatizing it in Australia they're suddenly doing that
[10:42.680 --> 10:46.640]  all over the United States in England it's all happening right now they're
[10:46.640 --> 10:52.360]  going to take your jobs and raise the prices to bankrupt you as a tool of
[10:52.360 --> 10:57.040]  total economic domination to them then they will come in with the new SDR
[10:57.040 --> 11:02.000]  global currency that will back your fiat currency that is simply a global
[11:02.000 --> 11:06.000]  currency local version just like your driver's license is federal it just says
[11:06.000 --> 11:10.920]  Texas or California that's the real ID that was in the executive order 1994 by
[11:10.920 --> 11:15.440]  Clinton implemented by 2000 you were told two years ago in 2008 this is all
[11:15.440 --> 11:21.360]  a strategic stated plan understand I am telling you their stated plan this is
[11:21.360 --> 11:27.600]  100% accurate the information you are receiving this is not my opinion but now
[11:27.600 --> 11:31.240]  we have a clear image of just how hardcore they're going to slam this
[11:31.240 --> 11:37.400]  economy it's worse than I thought it is road warrior ish it is the road level
[11:37.400 --> 11:42.400]  that film about collapse of society and out of that collapse will come the total
[11:42.400 --> 11:46.760]  deindustrialization and then the completely managed society the
[11:46.760 --> 11:50.680]  collectivist society of the New World Order this is their stated aim at the
[11:50.680 --> 11:56.760]  Pentagon at the UN at the Club of Rome at the Council on Foreign Relations so
[11:56.760 --> 12:02.520]  let's get into the information right now finally CBS news and others are
[12:02.520 --> 12:06.800]  reporting that every major poll shows Obama has dropped to 40 points at least
[12:06.800 --> 12:12.880]  in some polls he has a low 30% approval rating in some polls over a 70%
[12:12.880 --> 12:17.360]  negative approval rating the Times of London the Financial Times the
[12:17.360 --> 12:22.320]  Associated Press Reuters Politico Wall Street Journal New York Times are all
[12:22.320 --> 12:27.080]  announcing that Obama is politically destroyed and that he's not treading
[12:27.080 --> 12:33.280]  water that he is sunken beneath the waves it is a complete collapse suddenly
[12:33.280 --> 12:39.760]  we're seeing globalist think tanks openly speaking top Clinton advisor of
[12:39.760 --> 12:44.680]  course mr. Shapiro and others are in the news saying if we don't have another
[12:44.680 --> 12:51.080]  Oklahoma City or 9-11 Obama is done and our agenda for globalization is over so
[12:51.080 --> 12:54.360]  the elites are openly showing there's an internal debate about this we know
[12:54.360 --> 12:58.760]  there is saying look we've got to have a terror attack even if the 9-11 truthers
[12:58.760 --> 13:02.800]  and the Oklahoma City people that have exposed that as an inside job even though
[13:02.800 --> 13:06.680]  they've done their work and exposed us and a lot of elites believe that that
[13:06.680 --> 13:11.440]  false flag tool has been irrevocably damaged that they've got to go with a
[13:11.440 --> 13:16.600]  false flag let's cover that first then we'll look at the other false flags
[13:16.600 --> 13:22.880]  economic military and of course environmental that they are executing
[13:22.880 --> 13:27.760]  and exacerbating from the oil spill the situation with Iran this is going to
[13:27.760 --> 13:32.600]  be a perfect storm Obama isn't meant to survive this politically and maybe not
[13:32.600 --> 13:37.400]  even physically and we pray that doesn't happen he is meant to be destroyed in the
[13:37.400 --> 13:43.160]  process that is what these globalists do this is how they operate now let's go
[13:43.160 --> 13:49.000]  over it this is a prison planet dot com article directly quoting directly
[13:49.000 --> 13:52.840]  quoting the Financial Times of London that came out last night was the top link
[13:52.840 --> 13:57.840]  on the drudge report at about 8 p.m. I was up here working one of the guys came
[13:57.840 --> 14:03.280]  over and handed me the article with it highlighted and then I had Aaron post it
[14:03.280 --> 14:06.160]  and then Paul Watson did a story this morning so so this is getting major
[14:06.160 --> 14:11.760]  attention and that's good top Clinton official only a terror attack can save
[14:11.760 --> 14:17.120]  Obama then Watson chillingly with his precise research goes through all the
[14:17.120 --> 14:23.120]  previous statements of the think tanks calling for staged terror attacks now
[14:23.120 --> 14:30.720]  let me actually just read to you from the Financial Times of London itself so
[14:30.720 --> 14:36.400]  you can see this here is the Financial Times of London and this story is now
[14:36.400 --> 14:40.280]  the official talking point there are hundreds of papers all simultaneously
[14:40.280 --> 14:46.480]  reporting this worldwide today so they are purposefully destroying Obama they
[14:46.480 --> 14:51.400]  are purposely admitting he has collapsed and saying he needs a terror attack
[14:51.400 --> 14:57.000]  listen to this quote okay this is by mr. Shapiro top advisor to Bill Clinton
[14:57.000 --> 15:02.880]  and advisor to Iraq Hussein Obama the bottom line here is that Americans
[15:02.880 --> 15:07.080]  don't believe in president Obama's leadership says Rob Shapiro another
[15:07.080 --> 15:11.680]  former Clinton official and supporter of Obama he has to find some way between
[15:11.680 --> 15:16.800]  now and November of demonstrating that he is a leader who can command confidence
[15:16.800 --> 15:22.720]  and short of a 9-11 event or Oklahoma City bombing I can't think of how he
[15:22.720 --> 15:31.680]  could do that now I just read you that quote I just went over that quote for
[15:31.680 --> 15:40.680]  you here on air now you dovetail that with the mindset of these people and
[15:40.680 --> 15:46.320]  with the Pentagon just four years ago or three years ago under Rumsfeld
[15:46.320 --> 15:51.840]  Donald Rumsfeld and they released the audio tape of this with these top
[15:51.840 --> 15:54.920]  generals saying sir we need another 9-11 we've got to have it or our agenda is
[15:54.920 --> 15:58.480]  going to stall and he said yeah but that's tough that's tough to do he comes
[15:58.480 --> 16:06.960]  within a Bible page just just microscopic thin membrane thin distance
[16:06.960 --> 16:11.720]  of saying they stage 9-11 it is so incredible to to see them and you see
[16:11.720 --> 16:15.840]  all these neocons writing headlines about how great 9-11 was how they did
[16:15.840 --> 16:20.000]  another one internal Republican Party chairman that came out in the news a
[16:20.000 --> 16:25.080]  few years ago saying we need another 9-11 or McCain won't get elected you see
[16:25.080 --> 16:30.680]  this is bipartisan this is their crisis creation mentality but it is so
[16:30.680 --> 16:34.440]  important to get this report out to everyone top Clinton official only a
[16:34.440 --> 16:38.440]  terror attack can save Obama now I'm gonna go back into this in a moment but
[16:38.440 --> 16:44.400]  here is another report the October surprise is coming and of course it is
[16:44.400 --> 16:49.920]  Fox News outsider wins Alabama GOP governor nomination self-described
[16:49.920 --> 16:53.840]  outsider Robert Bentley won Alabama's Republican nomination for Governor
[16:53.840 --> 16:56.880]  Tuesday night over established candidate Bradley
[16:56.880 --> 17:02.000]  brine with a strong showing in rural areas see people are going and voting
[17:02.000 --> 17:05.720]  out Democrats who were seen as establishment specter in the primary
[17:05.720 --> 17:09.480]  Republicans that are seen as establishment running against Rand Paul he
[17:09.480 --> 17:19.000]  wins in Kentucky Hawaii Utah Colorado Massachusetts you know the cases this
[17:19.000 --> 17:24.360]  is not one party in favor one party out of favor the reason the system is
[17:24.360 --> 17:28.680]  panicking they can always just exchange take a left step take a right step
[17:28.680 --> 17:32.640]  nobody ever looks at the body these legs are carrying or the brain the global
[17:32.640 --> 17:36.960]  central banks they look at the legs or they look at the wing the left wing of
[17:36.960 --> 17:40.600]  the right wing not the bird the wings are attached to that's what we focus on
[17:40.600 --> 17:45.640]  here is this carrying crow is this buzzard this vulture this blood-drinking
[17:45.640 --> 17:53.880]  corrupt parasitic vampiric system of oppression and and corruption so the
[17:53.880 --> 17:58.200]  reason they're in panic mode is and I told you this year and a half ago because
[17:58.200 --> 18:01.600]  I saw Republicans and Democrats being booted every town hall the media spun
[18:01.600 --> 18:05.920]  it said it was just the leftist again getting ready to scapegoat Obama the
[18:05.920 --> 18:09.440]  left's doing that because they're all part of the same power structure Fox
[18:09.440 --> 18:12.680]  News and the right wing are playing along with that and they're trying to
[18:12.680 --> 18:16.560]  manage it imposes anti-establishment so they can hold on the only one that's
[18:16.560 --> 18:21.840]  done it is Rick Perry so far he's the only person to win as an incumbent in a
[18:21.840 --> 18:26.680]  primary in the last year and a half because he started claiming he was
[18:26.680 --> 18:30.400]  shooting coyotes in the city limits and wearing cowboy hats and being seen with
[18:30.400 --> 18:33.480]  guns every day and talking about secession and fighting the New World
[18:33.480 --> 18:38.960]  Order I mean he put on the coloration of an Alex Jones and so he was able to
[18:38.960 --> 18:45.560]  survive my friends this is so massive what's happening the elite are gonna
[18:45.560 --> 18:48.360]  hit you and hit you hard to keep you in the left-right paradigm they're gonna

[18:56.920 --> 19:00.560]  that in the last two days to scare black people and to keep them on the

[19:12.000 --> 19:15.440]  that's another example of false flag terror where they're invoking race
[19:15.440 --> 19:20.120]  cold-bloodedly knowing it has nothing to do with it to manipulate and control
[19:20.120 --> 19:25.840]  people the oil spill clearly they gave orders to the operators that they knew

[24:14.720 --> 24:17.800]  we're back live my friends thank you for joining us Larry Pratt Richard Reeves
[24:17.800 --> 24:25.680]  scheduled today Richard Reeves in studio when I get on air and I tell you this is
[24:25.680 --> 24:29.180]  one of the most important if not the most important broadcast I've ever done
[24:29.180 --> 24:33.340]  it's just all the facts are out on the table everything we predicted everything
[24:33.340 --> 24:38.060]  we got from the globalist documents and think tanks and leaks is just confirmed
[24:38.060 --> 24:42.980]  this is their plan this is their program the designed collapse of society and I'm
[24:42.980 --> 24:47.340]  gonna talk about that collapse and how we can fight against this by exposing the
[24:47.340 --> 24:51.460]  culprits and the fact that it is by design they're going to collapse society
[24:51.460 --> 24:56.100]  blame their puppets and then offer their solution of even more tyranny and the
[24:56.100 --> 25:00.700]  nanny state and the carbon tax control system through the crisis they're now
[25:00.700 --> 25:04.660]  orchestrating and I'm going to cover that in a moment but first I cannot
[25:04.660 --> 25:08.300]  illustrate to you the viewers and listeners of this radio broadcast and
[25:08.300 --> 25:13.300]  the folks watching in prison planet dot TV that this report by Paul Watson
[25:13.300 --> 25:18.300]  reporting on what was said in the Financial Times of London yesterday is so
[25:18.300 --> 25:26.740]  essential top Clinton official only a terror attack and save America a former
[25:26.740 --> 25:31.020]  senior advisor to President Bill Clinton says that the one thing which can
[25:31.020 --> 25:35.940]  rescue Barack Obama's increasingly tenuous grip on power as his approval
[25:35.940 --> 25:39.860]  writing continues to plunge is a terror attack on the scale of Oklahoma City or
[25:39.860 --> 25:45.300]  9-11 another startling reminder that such events only ever serve to benefit
[25:45.300 --> 25:49.260]  those in authority buried in a Financial Times article about Obama's growing
[25:49.260 --> 25:53.100]  credibility crisis and fears on behalf of Democrats that they could lose not
[25:53.100 --> 25:57.340]  only the White House but the Senate and the House to Republicans Robert
[25:57.340 --> 26:01.820]  Shapiro makes it clear that Obama is relying on an October surprise in the
[26:01.820 --> 26:06.180]  form of a terror attack to rescue his presidency and an attack on Iran is a
[26:06.180 --> 26:10.700]  terror attack that'll drive up oil start real terror attacks Iran sure to strike
[26:10.700 --> 26:13.380]  back I mean it's going to be hellish they'll be able to crack down on
[26:13.380 --> 26:16.740]  political dissent take over the web as they've been saying they need this new
[26:16.740 --> 26:20.780]  cybersecurity bill to shut the web off during a war you can see it all coming
[26:20.780 --> 26:24.820]  together this is the greatest danger this country has been in since its
[26:24.820 --> 26:30.420]  foundation since we were battling to start the country here's the quote the
[26:30.420 --> 26:33.280]  bottom line here is that Americans don't believe in President Obama's
[26:33.280 --> 26:37.740]  leadership said Shapiro adding quote he has to find some way between now
[26:37.740 --> 26:42.100]  November of demonstrating that he is a leader who can command confidence and
[26:42.100 --> 26:46.500]  short of a 9-11 event or an Oklahoma City bombing I can't think of how he
[26:46.500 --> 26:51.460]  could do just that this is why we talk about stage terror so much because it
[26:51.460 --> 26:58.220]  is the ace in the hole it is the royal flush it is the major trump card that
[26:58.220 --> 27:05.380]  they play and by exposing this we're able to stop these people and the fact
[27:05.380 --> 27:08.420]  that the public is starting to wake up I went over and saw my parents late last
[27:08.420 --> 27:11.500]  night when I was driving home in about 10 and I got the book in the car I
[27:11.500 --> 27:14.420]  forget the title but but it's the best-selling New York Times number one
[27:14.420 --> 27:20.420]  best-selling author who wrote Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil and my
[27:20.420 --> 27:24.500]  dad's like this book is about stage terror you know the book title deals
[27:24.500 --> 27:28.580]  with a theater fire that happened in Venice but it talks about how it's
[27:28.580 --> 27:32.660]  nonfiction how he met with the elite of Italy and the Prime Minister and others
[27:32.660 --> 27:36.340]  who I know on record exposed that our government stage terror attacks in
[27:36.340 --> 27:39.300]  Italy in the 70s and 80s to blame it on their political enemies it's called
[27:39.300 --> 27:43.380]  Operation Gladio but the point that a New York Times number one best-sellers
[27:43.380 --> 27:47.100]  new book out that's already a New York Times best-seller and I meant to bring
[27:47.100 --> 27:50.940]  it in if that guys will you grab my keys and run out it's in the passenger seat
[27:50.940 --> 27:56.660]  of my car that that that that that my dad just you know grabs you know
[27:56.660 --> 28:04.820]  literature or I mean top nonfiction book and within 15 pages it's a book
[28:04.820 --> 28:09.540]  really about false flag terror I mean it's just everywhere you go see movies
[28:09.540 --> 28:13.220]  like Children of Men it's all about the government staging terror attacks and
[28:13.220 --> 28:17.620]  putting a sterilization chemical into the population I mean most movies I see
[28:17.620 --> 28:24.340]  now even in fiction so the point is there's been a huge awakening to the
[28:24.340 --> 28:31.660]  fact that all of this is going on there has been a renaissance in
[28:31.660 --> 28:36.220]  understanding almost a revelation in understanding of this and everywhere I
[28:36.220 --> 28:40.380]  see it in popular culture and this is not just the system conditioning us this
[28:40.380 --> 28:46.100]  is people rebelling who are authors and artists and filmmakers I mean I talked
[28:46.100 --> 28:52.140]  to a lot of these people and of course it's the city of falling angels by the
[28:52.140 --> 28:56.500]  author of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil and the New York Times says a
[28:56.500 --> 29:01.780]  urbane and beautifully fashioned book number one New York Times bestseller
[29:01.780 --> 29:09.380]  John Burnett I hope I'm pronouncing that right and here it is and it it's just so
[29:09.380 --> 29:16.420]  incredible that on page 92 it talks about Operation Gladio and how the
[29:16.420 --> 29:19.380]  Italian Prime Minister talked to him about our government stages terror
[29:19.380 --> 29:25.340]  attacks to set up a police state and of course the same Italian Prime Minister
[29:25.340 --> 29:28.820]  who's gone public two years ago saying 9-11's an inside job that's not in the
[29:28.820 --> 29:33.340]  book at least as far as we know we haven't gotten through the book yet but
[29:33.340 --> 29:41.780]  just a side point example of how the awakening to false flag terror is really
[29:41.780 --> 29:45.660]  exploding we're gonna come back into the most important information in this
[29:45.660 --> 29:49.940]  whole rant that I'm laying out and how we can stop these people straight ahead

[33:59.340 --> 34:03.620]  Bill Clinton this is the guy at the Council on Farm Relations in 2000 with
[34:03.620 --> 34:07.380]  the Hart-Rudman Commission that wrote up the current plan we're living under he
[34:07.380 --> 34:13.060]  said we're gonna use this disaster 9-11 to establish a new world order remember
[34:13.060 --> 34:17.820]  that quote in fact people won't believe it you guys when you get a chance I don't
[34:17.820 --> 34:22.260]  need it right now search engine the term on YouTube it'll be for my films but
[34:22.260 --> 34:29.020]  was on C-span it'll be Gary Hart says use 9-11 for New World Order and it's him
[34:29.020 --> 34:32.740]  sitting in a desk we need to use this disaster for what the president's father
[34:32.740 --> 34:40.860]  called a New World Order that's an exact quote so that's why it's so important
[34:40.860 --> 34:46.260]  to get this article out top Clinton official only a terror attack can save
[34:46.260 --> 34:50.740]  Obama what have I been saying for the last six months when he went down below
[34:50.740 --> 34:54.820]  50% approval rating now at 40 and dropping a point or so every week in
[34:54.820 --> 35:02.580]  freefall I said only a terror attack a huge staged war will work some other
[35:02.580 --> 35:06.740]  type of natural disaster we're now seeing that man-made natural disaster it's a
[35:06.740 --> 35:10.500]  man-made disaster that's now a disaster in nature I guess will be the proper way
[35:10.500 --> 35:17.860]  to put it a environmental disaster a border disaster notice how they tell
[35:17.860 --> 35:21.580]  Arizona we're not gonna let you fix that problem the thousands of dead you're
[35:21.580 --> 35:26.180]  the kidnapping capital of the United States now over 80 miles the country
[35:26.180 --> 35:31.660]  off limits to citizens and Obama told Senator Kyle a month ago we can't let it
[35:31.660 --> 35:35.620]  get better we've got to let it collapse so we can have a North American Union so
[35:35.620 --> 35:39.740]  we can have legalization of the illegals what did the BAMP Canada meeting 2006
[35:39.740 --> 35:46.060]  he classified 2007 say we will use border crises to merge Canada and Mexico into
[35:46.060 --> 35:51.220]  a unified security perimeter around the North American continent from Alaska
[35:51.220 --> 35:56.980]  to the southern border of Mexico with Guatemala don't let a good crisis go to
[35:56.980 --> 36:02.780]  waste this is their methodology we have their playbook we know they think you're
[36:02.780 --> 36:08.700]  so stupid and so pathetic that they will sit there all over the news I mean
[36:08.700 --> 36:11.620]  Watson's got a bunch of examples of them in the news saying Obama needs another
[36:11.620 --> 36:19.940]  Oklahoma City or another 9-11 with the the thinnest of veiled threats the I
[36:19.940 --> 36:25.220]  described it earlier is as thick as a Bible page I mean it is see through 100
[36:25.220 --> 36:31.900]  percent and they are desperate and they are using every crisis they can remember
[36:31.900 --> 36:35.900]  people say well this crisis the oil is going to destroy Obama the collapsing
[36:35.900 --> 36:39.900]  border and the lawsuit against Arizona is going to destroy Obama Obama's
[36:39.900 --> 36:43.780]  socialist health care it's so unpopular over 70% in polls when they passed it
[36:43.780 --> 36:47.620]  we're against it even higher now the media puts out whitewash polls of 60% or
[36:47.620 --> 36:54.900]  so 5560 why would he do this because his job is to take all the heat you know my
[36:54.900 --> 37:00.340]  parents have a cockatoo and the cockatoo is the New World Order here's my
[37:00.340 --> 37:07.820]  parable or or analysis analogy and they put birdcage liner in every couple of
[37:07.820 --> 37:12.300]  days they put the Austin America statesman newspaper the local paper in
[37:12.300 --> 37:18.020]  the minutes there for its droppings and for the food it doesn't eat the drop the
[37:18.020 --> 37:21.220]  bird waste about half the food each plays with it there's all this food and
[37:21.220 --> 37:25.220]  crap at the bottom of it and Barack Obama is the birdcage liner and the New
[37:25.220 --> 37:28.500]  World Order is crapping on us and dropping food on us and we're blaming
[37:28.500 --> 37:32.860]  the birdcage liner and it's nasty and it's gross and it's ugly and it's but
[37:32.860 --> 37:37.460]  still the bird is the issue George W. Bush birdcage liner here's another
[37:37.460 --> 37:47.140]  analogy or another parallel to what we're talking about we're always
[37:47.140 --> 37:51.900]  focusing on the red cape we're the bull well we're smarter than a bull but we
[37:51.900 --> 37:57.580]  don't act like that and the Matador uses that that red and he comes up and
[37:57.580 --> 38:02.100]  throws little darts in the back of the bull to get the bull out of sorts angry
[38:02.100 --> 38:06.380]  one dart is the oil spill another dart is the imploding economy and other darts
[38:06.380 --> 38:10.100]  the open borders another dart is socialist health care another dart is
[38:10.100 --> 38:13.660]  police refusing to stop criminals now openly this has always been the policy
[38:13.660 --> 38:17.500]  in the last hundred years now it's just public so they're throwing all these
[38:17.500 --> 38:22.020]  darts in and we just get in rage with anger and now he gets out his red cape
[38:22.020 --> 38:28.060]  and he likes to toy with us and so the bull runs by and he he he laughs and
[38:28.060 --> 38:35.220]  roses are thrown to him by the people in the stands around him in Barcelona the
[38:35.220 --> 38:39.620]  whole world is a stage each of us players opponent of Shakespeare said and we
[38:39.620 --> 38:43.660]  charged through and and and that's the equivalent of them openly saying we need
[38:43.660 --> 38:47.180]  a terror attack in the newspaper these these ignorant fools will never even
[38:47.180 --> 38:50.180]  notice what we're talking about you know Gary Hart's writing public letters
[38:50.180 --> 38:53.460]  about how they staged terror attacks thinking we're too stupid to understand
[38:53.460 --> 39:01.100]  it it's it's all just a little inside joke to them and so the Matador does
[39:01.100 --> 39:05.500]  that and then finally the bulls got snot coming out his nose he's angry he's
[39:05.500 --> 39:10.660]  exhausted this bull fights gone on for 35 minutes and the Matador pulls out his
[39:10.660 --> 39:17.980]  sword long and sharp and he puts the red cape out and the bull charges and he
[39:17.980 --> 39:24.340]  steps aside and the bull impales itself the Matador with precision stands
[39:24.340 --> 39:28.060]  before the neural order crowd and they cheer him and they throw the rose
[39:28.060 --> 39:31.900]  petals at him and the Senoritas want to go out with him that night and
[39:31.900 --> 39:38.940]  everybody buys him drinks at the bar and he's wealthy he's the star I don't
[39:38.940 --> 39:45.100]  focus on Barack Obama the red cape I don't focus on George W. Bush or Sarah
[39:45.100 --> 39:50.540]  Palin or Glenn Beck being set up for a fall the bird cage liner I focus on the
[39:50.540 --> 39:58.780]  bird I focus on the Matador I focus on the head the brain the system the control
[39:58.780 --> 40:06.020]  arm the philosophy and if we are able to expose this paradigm to people if we
[40:06.020 --> 40:12.980]  are able to reveal this to the population if we are able to cause a
[40:12.980 --> 40:17.980]  exponential viral understanding and common sense awakening to these tools
[40:17.980 --> 40:22.900]  that are used and point people at the mountains encyclopedia on top of
[40:22.900 --> 40:26.500]  encyclopedia of admissions because the elite you know there's tens of thousands
[40:26.500 --> 40:30.900]  of high-level minions that orchestrate this for the few hundred elite or it's
[40:30.900 --> 40:35.260]  even less really if you break it down Rothkopf the head of the Kissinger
[40:35.260 --> 40:40.060]  group in his best-selling book called at the superclass of their 6,000 mega
[40:40.060 --> 40:46.700]  managers and less than a hundred owners they can't get away with this if you're
[40:46.700 --> 40:49.980]  aware of them but they have to communicate with their 6,000 operatives
[40:49.980 --> 40:54.980]  show it's all out there it's all there for you if you'll just go pick their
[40:54.980 --> 40:58.900]  playbook up you know in the NFL they guard those playbooks the globalists
[40:58.900 --> 41:02.500]  think you're so stupid they leave playbooks laying around all over the
[41:02.500 --> 41:06.500]  place for you but you're too busy listening to the latest Mel Gibson
[41:06.500 --> 41:12.180]  family spat you're too busy watching big people fall that you think are big and
[41:12.180 --> 41:15.820]  feeling good about yourself you're too busy making fun of Lindsay Lohan and
[41:15.820 --> 41:20.260]  feeling powerful when she fails in his human you're too busy worshiping LeBron
[41:20.260 --> 41:24.700]  James who has the chosen one tattooed blasphemously on his back and on a
[41:24.700 --> 41:29.020]  power trip thinking he's a god life will guarantee show him that he's just a
[41:29.020 --> 41:32.940]  man you know the beginning of wisdom is being humble and realizing we're all
[41:32.940 --> 41:36.220]  just humans but together through our species and through doing the right
[41:36.220 --> 41:40.500]  thing that's what gives us beauty and power and strength and honor not being a
[41:40.500 --> 41:47.980]  bunch of arrogant skin deep fools so we are at this crossroads right now and I
[41:47.980 --> 41:53.740]  want to play for you the clip from C-span this was just a few days ever
[41:53.740 --> 41:58.420]  9-11 with the Hart Rudman CFR Commission talking about using 9-11 for a new
[41:58.420 --> 42:04.260]  world order here it is there is there is a chance the president the United
[42:04.260 --> 42:10.060]  States to use this disaster to carry out what his father a phrase his father
[42:10.060 --> 42:14.660]  used I think only once and hasn't been used since and that is a new world order
[42:14.660 --> 42:22.700]  new world coming America will become increasingly vulnerable to hostile
[42:22.700 --> 42:30.980]  attack on our homeland and our military superiority will not entirely protect us
[42:30.980 --> 42:39.060]  Americans will likely die on American soil possibly enlarged yeah that's a
[42:39.060 --> 42:42.780]  clip from road to tyranny the worst res I've ever seen somebody put on YouTube
[42:42.780 --> 42:47.260]  you can see it in high quality and my film road to tyranny on DVD 3-hour film
[42:47.260 --> 42:51.300]  breaking down their operations from 2002 and you watch that film today eight
[42:51.300 --> 42:54.860]  years later it's more pertinent today than when I made it because almost
[42:54.860 --> 42:59.340]  everything that we broke down has now come true these films get more powerful
[42:59.340 --> 43:03.660]  with time they're evergreen they just keep coming and getting stronger that's
[43:03.660 --> 43:09.620]  why we're having an exponential effect on the new world order just is there is a
[43:09.620 --> 43:12.060]  let's play it again actually since you I mean I mean let's go ahead and play it
[43:12.060 --> 43:18.540]  go ahead and play it again a phrase his father used I think only once and hasn't
[43:18.540 --> 43:23.940]  been used since and that is a new world order new world coming
[43:23.940 --> 43:29.820]  America will become increasingly vulnerable to hostile attack okay on
[43:29.820 --> 43:33.380]  our homeland and right there he's reading from a council on foreign relations
[43:33.380 --> 43:39.220]  report they'd written a year ago a year before 9-11 about how there were gonna
[43:39.220 --> 43:42.980]  be huge terror attacks and life would change forever and within 15 minutes of
[43:42.980 --> 43:50.060]  the attacks on CNN Fox CBS NBC ABC all channels they had globalists with the
[43:50.060 --> 43:54.140]  same talking point our life has changed the new order is here you're gonna have
[43:54.140 --> 43:57.820]  to give your rights up we're gonna have to attack Iraq and Afghanistan they had
[43:57.820 --> 44:02.380]  their talking points ready now three's the charm let's play it from the start
[44:02.380 --> 44:06.900]  go ahead and play it again there is there is a chance the president the
[44:06.900 --> 44:12.660]  United States to use this disaster to carry out what his father a phrase his
[44:12.660 --> 44:16.940]  father used I think only once and hasn't been used since and that is a new
[44:16.940 --> 44:21.140]  world order okay new world coming all right let's go ahead now and play the
[44:21.140 --> 44:26.300]  clip of Sanchez on CNN two days ago talking about the horrible bombings in
[44:26.300 --> 44:30.700]  Africa and saying well this is actually helpful to understand how evil the
[44:30.700 --> 44:34.860]  Muslims are and if that's the case so be it again this is their mindset you've
[44:34.860 --> 44:38.940]  got to think like the enemy and this guy is showing off to the CIA officer who's
[44:38.940 --> 44:43.580]  smiling when he says this that hey I'm on the inside you know I'm Sanchez from
[44:43.580 --> 44:49.620]  from CNN I understand these things this is this is their their sick culture here
[44:49.620 --> 44:54.940]  it is but you know what's interesting about this in a strange way the event is
[44:54.940 --> 45:02.980]  helpful to the cause of those of us who know how sadistic these fundamental
[45:02.980 --> 45:07.740]  radical Islamic terrorists are and if it helps get the message out there that
[45:07.740 --> 45:16.820]  these are not the good guys then so be it now folks I'm not saying that there
[45:16.820 --> 45:20.860]  aren't extreme Muslims and that part of that culture and in sex of it do want to
[45:20.860 --> 45:27.220]  take over I don't want to live in Saudi Arabia I mean I don't want to live in
[45:27.220 --> 45:34.340]  areas like Somalia but the point is our government went in after World War II on
[45:34.340 --> 45:39.020]  record and radicalized Muslims as a bolster against communism and use the
[45:39.020 --> 45:44.700]  turban-headed guys that mutilate women and and and you know do all that as a way
[45:44.700 --> 45:47.860]  to overthrow secular mainline governments they didn't want big
[45:47.860 --> 45:52.100]  glistening buildings and swimming pools and jet airplanes in the Middle East and
[45:52.100 --> 45:55.940]  Central Asia they don't want First World Nations that is their set policy in the
[45:55.940 --> 46:02.580]  Royal Commission on population 49 on State Department random 200 from 1973 and
[46:02.580 --> 46:06.620]  literally hundreds of other declassified government documents from the US and
[46:06.620 --> 46:11.940]  England that we've read here on air the point is they have forged radical Islam
[46:11.940 --> 46:18.500]  and supercharged it and opened doors for them and protected them in many cases or
[46:18.500 --> 46:22.340]  funded groups to fund terrorist and then open the door for them to attack and
[46:22.340 --> 46:27.060]  that's just a fact because they get more power and control and when you and when
[46:27.060 --> 46:31.260]  we got the my act at Homeland Security reports a year and a half ago who was
[46:31.260 --> 46:33.980]  the number one target of the federal government Homeland Security and by the
[46:33.980 --> 46:38.060]  way this was a reissue when so something put out in Bush's last year but the
[46:38.060 --> 46:41.900]  right wing picked it up to say Obama did it well no he did do it he continued it
[46:41.900 --> 46:45.580]  and accelerated it but they're all part of the same team that's the big message
[46:45.580 --> 46:52.460]  that's the big issue here that everybody has got to understand right now is that
[46:52.460 --> 46:56.340]  that my act at Homeland Security report that said the number one terror threat is
[46:56.340 --> 46:59.620]  returning veterans gun owners conservatives libertarians Ron Paul
[46:59.620 --> 47:03.220]  supporters people that want to abolish the Federal Reserve we'll see we're the
[47:03.220 --> 47:06.820]  good guys we're the people that know about the corporate criminal takeover of
[47:06.820 --> 47:10.380]  America we're the people that understand who the players are we're the people that
[47:10.380 --> 47:13.980]  understand the battlefield we're the people that see clearly we are the
[47:13.980 --> 47:18.460]  enemy all of this is for us if you've got a portrait of John Wayne hanging in
[47:18.460 --> 47:22.580]  your house folks you're the enemy and when I say that I mean that that is what
[47:22.580 --> 47:27.980]  they describe quintessentially as their enemy if you're against welfare corporate
[47:27.980 --> 47:32.420]  and individual if you're against corruption and boss hog and big city
[47:32.420 --> 47:37.580]  systems of oppression you're the enemy if you're red-blooded you're the enemy
[47:37.580 --> 47:41.420]  you're the enemy because you're not gonna go along with what's about to happen
[47:41.420 --> 47:50.060]  you can skin a buck you can run a trot line you can make homemade wine you've
[47:50.060 --> 47:55.060]  got a rifle a shotgun and a four-wheel drive you've got a back 40 when they
[47:55.060 --> 47:59.460]  collapse society you've always been the enemy what's about to happen has been
[47:59.460 --> 48:03.740]  prepared for decades they practiced over and over again in third world and
[48:03.740 --> 48:07.900]  first world and old world nations now they're gonna do it in Europe England
[48:07.900 --> 48:12.060]  in the United States now they're about to bring in the greatest crisis to
[48:12.060 --> 48:16.300]  establish their world government and if you could skin a buck and run a trot line
[48:16.300 --> 48:19.940]  and you're not gonna turn your guns in ladies and gentlemen you're the ones
[48:19.940 --> 48:22.940]  they're coming after you're the ones they've tried to twist the police to the
[48:22.940 --> 48:27.260]  dark side to think you're the enemy but we're waking up the police and military
[48:27.260 --> 48:31.260]  and the globalist have overreached and we've got a good chance to blow up the
[48:31.260 --> 48:35.820]  Death Star and I mean that figuratively their whole system we are inside the
[48:35.820 --> 48:39.980]  superstructure right now ladies and gentlemen and we are going in towards the
[48:39.980 --> 48:46.620]  reactor and it is balls to the walls 110% this is it this is history you
[48:46.620 --> 48:50.580]  better understand that the entire New World Order is focused on you America
[48:50.580 --> 48:54.620]  you could skin a buck you can run a trot line they hate your guts whether you
[48:54.620 --> 48:58.900]  live in Texas or Michigan or Northern California or upstate New York or the
[48:58.900 --> 49:04.300]  Panhandle out in the boonies of Florida or Iowa or Illinois or Oklahoma they
[49:04.300 --> 49:08.740]  hate your guts you know the new orders got up on the wall in their enemy
[49:08.740 --> 49:14.020]  meetings where they talk about it they've had from who's an admitted
[49:14.020 --> 49:17.500]  Bilderberg group member writing articles about me every week in the last month
[49:17.500 --> 49:21.780]  saying I'm the number one enemy and also after Ron Paul and Rand Paul they
[49:21.780 --> 49:26.140]  literally have got our photos up on the wall we're at where all there is between
[49:26.140 --> 49:30.940]  total enslavement and it's not that Ron Paul's perfect or Alex Jones perfect or
[49:30.940 --> 49:33.900]  we're these great leaders it's that we're the people that were at least real
[49:33.900 --> 49:39.060]  enough to have a focus to stand up to be involved to speak out to analyze the

[50:03.460 --> 50:07.980]  system they are going to coast to coast lay off large portions of police and
[50:07.980 --> 50:12.180]  fire it's already happening and they are going to tell the public as is in the
[50:12.180 --> 50:21.060]  case with Oakland that they are not even going to respond to these are the 40

[51:02.380 --> 51:05.740]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[51:05.740 --> 51:09.700]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[51:09.700 --> 51:13.940]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[51:13.940 --> 51:18.220]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[51:18.220 --> 51:22.580]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[51:22.580 --> 51:26.660]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[51:26.660 --> 51:31.220]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[51:31.220 --> 51:35.380]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[51:35.380 --> 51:39.300]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[51:39.300 --> 51:43.140]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[51:43.140 --> 51:45.860]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[54:49.620 --> 54:53.540]  I want to be clear here they have decided that you're coddled your decadent
[54:53.540 --> 54:57.700]  you're obsessed with the system you're scared they can hold your pension funds
[54:57.700 --> 55:01.580]  hostage a year and a half ago and steal trillions of dollars with a bailout and
[55:01.580 --> 55:06.580]  they think you'll accept losing part of your pensions to quote keep them all of
[55:06.580 --> 55:10.820]  this is being announced now they think that when they implode society and the
[55:10.820 --> 55:15.380]  police stop showing up at your house that you're going to panic and become
[55:15.380 --> 55:19.940]  even more domesticated and say I'll take carbon taxes I'll do whatever you say
[55:19.940 --> 55:25.300]  just turn the economy back on I'll accept a war with Iran just turn the
[55:25.300 --> 55:28.420]  economy back on they are holding you hostage with the border what an Obama
[55:28.420 --> 55:31.940]  tell senator Kyle we can't fix the border and all the deaths in the
[55:31.940 --> 55:36.260]  kidnapping because we need that as a crisis to get amnesty which is the
[55:36.260 --> 55:39.980]  North American Union the guest worker program the wide open system it's all
[55:39.980 --> 55:44.260]  stated by the public CFR report that they admit is word-for-word the
[55:44.260 --> 55:49.300]  legislation that Bush introduced three times and that Obama's introduced it's
[55:49.300 --> 55:54.620]  word-for-word the same it's congruency between them it just continues and they
[55:54.620 --> 55:57.860]  know you're waking up and they know there's been a realignment and so you
[55:57.860 --> 56:02.620]  think about the magnitude of that because not only is Oakland cutting cops
[56:02.620 --> 56:06.860]  and holding people hostage and saying we won't respond to robbery and muggings
[56:06.860 --> 56:12.460]  and poison it says if you poison someone they won't respond and sabotaging
[56:12.460 --> 56:17.580]  power polls I mean this is insane this is actually under the Patriot Act but
[56:17.580 --> 56:21.900]  they're not going to enforce it because they want increased pay they want
[56:21.900 --> 56:24.300]  increased money they're holding you hostage they're saying we're not going
[56:24.300 --> 56:27.660]  to fix the roads we're not going to put new police radios in we're not going to
[56:27.660 --> 56:31.540]  do anything unless you capitulate and thumb print to get guns and they're
[56:31.540 --> 56:35.820]  actually increasing funding for anti-gun programs in California I talked to
[56:35.820 --> 56:39.340]  people I know that live in very wealthy neighborhoods of Los Angeles and Beverly
[56:39.340 --> 56:43.500]  Hills and major roads wash out a year ago they don't fix them now they just
[56:43.500 --> 56:46.300]  shut roads they've announced in the LA Times they're not going to fix major
[56:46.300 --> 56:51.140]  roads and sidewalks a few months ago the same thing is happening all over the
[56:51.140 --> 56:55.780]  country remember that story out of Ohio where they've laid off from 112
[56:55.780 --> 57:01.060]  deputies to 49 and the sheriff was honest there he said buy guns we can't
[57:01.060 --> 57:07.820]  protect you one deputy to respond to calls every shift of the other 43 or 49
[57:07.820 --> 57:14.260]  they are all to work at the jail and revenue generation so police starting in
[57:14.260 --> 57:18.460]  Chicago about a hundred years ago in New York in the last 70 or so there's the
[57:18.460 --> 57:22.460]  memos that even come out that have been in the news and a police chief got
[57:22.460 --> 57:25.700]  recorded what 20 something years ago in Chicago saying we're here to increase
[57:25.700 --> 57:30.700]  crime we don't want to keep violent offenders we want to get nonviolent and
[57:30.700 --> 57:34.100]  we want that we need some criminals out there to scare the public to thinking
[57:34.100 --> 57:37.740]  they need us notice the more cops we get we've got three times
[57:37.740 --> 57:41.980]  conservatively the police station why we had 15 years ago they've tripled or
[57:41.980 --> 57:47.820]  more but suddenly folks I had my car stolen what 15 years ago in Dallas then
[57:47.820 --> 57:51.780]  it got stolen a second time I'd go up there and visit a girlfriend got stolen
[57:51.780 --> 57:56.500]  twice from a decent area Dallas the police wouldn't even show up wouldn't
[57:56.500 --> 58:02.140]  even show up to her apartment when it happened and now they're just being
[58:02.140 --> 58:06.340]  public about the fact that they're there for revenue generation and they're
[58:06.340 --> 58:10.060]  going to let society collapse and these are coming in from Florida these are
[58:10.060 --> 58:15.460]  coming in everywhere they're saying burglary theft embezzlement grand theft
[58:15.460 --> 58:20.820]  extortion embezzlement attempted extortion false
[58:20.820 --> 58:25.940]  personification of other injured telephone or power line interfere with
[58:25.940 --> 58:30.340]  power line unauthorized cable TV connection vandalism so they mix petty
[58:30.340 --> 58:35.980]  things in administer exposed poison to another's poisoning people is now okay
[58:35.980 --> 58:44.420]  do you understand they are purposefully imploding the country thank you for

[59:02.300 --> 59:06.460]  into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs the
[59:06.460 --> 59:09.860]  respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and
[59:09.860 --> 59:14.540]  viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with
[59:14.540 --> 59:19.340]  your self-produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the silver
[59:19.340 --> 59:23.940]  nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation

[01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:13.780]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:21.300]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:28.980]  Alex Jones now I've been telling you about the problem how Obama admits he's
[01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:33.740]  allowed in the border to collapse the credit crisis we can form the SPP the
[01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:37.700]  North American Union Senator Kyle on record how they're blocking the oil
[01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:41.620]  relief and not letting it be cleaned up waiting for the hurricanes to blow it
[01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:45.220]  and to create a bigger crisis Obama will be politically destroyed but the
[01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:49.380]  globalists don't care we've covered how the financial times of London and others
[01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:53.860]  are reporting Obama is in free fall and needs a staged terror attack like
[01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:58.020]  Oklahoma City or 9-11 to quote be a strong leader to make us rally around
[01:00:58.020 --> 01:01:04.500]  him like a bunch of you know scared children we know all over the country
[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:08.620]  every day I see reports where they're announcing they're laying off a third a
[01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:13.820]  half or more or more of the police and saying the police are only allowed to
[01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:18.380]  revenue generate we will not respond to robberies to muggings to home invasions
[01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:22.060]  buy a gun at least in Ohio and Michigan where they've announced this they're
[01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:25.500]  saying buy a gun not in California they're saying you're not gonna have a
[01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:29.820]  gun we're gonna try to restrict that and we're not gonna protect you unless you
[01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:35.100]  accept higher taxes they raise the taxes and the economy implodes they know it's
[01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:39.020]  going to do that and they want to get all the parasites and all the dependence
[01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:42.660]  and all the little thugs that enjoy their petty power through the system and
[01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:47.420]  the and the uniforms that they animate they want to get them all riled up and
[01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:53.060]  scared so that they will go along with the oppression that's coming they are
[01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:57.380]  going to shut off the power they are going to increase the water prices they
[01:01:57.380 --> 01:02:01.580]  are going to drive you into submission they've done this in the third world
[01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:07.980]  it's called shock therapy this is a stated program 100% and we know what
[01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:14.500]  they are doing and it is treason it is outrageous those police officers should
[01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:19.300]  walk off the force and say we're going to protest until you say that we're gonna
[01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:23.900]  respond to crime again we have triple the cops we had 15 years ago
[01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:28.300]  conservatively they're trying to expand them again with taxpayer money and you
[01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:31.900]  can't get a cop when you need one most the time in these big mega cities a lot
[01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:35.580]  of towns are still decent Austin when I've needed the police they've come out
[01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:41.060]  and been very nice and done a good job but more and more in other areas of the
[01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:45.860]  country and we see where you call the police to your house there's been a
[01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:49.620]  break in and they taser and beat up an old woman on squad car video and in this
[01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:52.620]  latest case they did the right thing and fired the cops but who are these
[01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:58.060]  lunatics they're hiring we obviously need police I know it's a tough job but we
[01:02:58.060 --> 01:03:03.700]  need a smaller lean focus serious force that tracks down violent offenders and
[01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:09.380]  keeps them in jail I mean now in Oakland here's the bigger issue what happens
[01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:13.420]  when the Oakland police chief announces they won't respond to burglary theft
[01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:19.180]  embezzlement grand theft auto grand theft dog identity theft extortion attempted
[01:03:19.180 --> 01:03:27.180]  extortion administer exposed poison to another vandalism what is that
[01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:31.780]  message I mean it's almost like devil's night or something in Detroit where all
[01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:35.300]  the criminals go out and burn things at once so the police can't respond this is
[01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:39.300]  the police saying we're gonna take a hike just like New Orleans instead the cops
[01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:43.900]  were tying chains to jewelry stores and pawn shops stealing guns and jewelry and
[01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:46.980]  dragging safes down the road behind them and going into Walmart and kicking
[01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:50.860]  everybody out looting so the cops can walk out with big screen TVs I'm not
[01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:54.260]  here bashing police I know they're the good the bad and the ugly they're a mix
[01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:59.220]  like everybody else but they recruit slime they recruit scum they recruit
[01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:03.660]  people with low IQs that's on record in many police departments you can't have
[01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:08.980]  above an average IQ because with wisdom most the time comes decency and people
[01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:15.180]  being honorable they want a bunch of dumb goons they can manipulate and then
[01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:18.660]  if you get sick at a 9-11 rescue or you get sick cleaning up oil and you're
[01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:22.020]  begging for help as a cop you're not gonna get it and once you're not a cop
[01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:24.900]  anymore once you're out of the military and the internal documents you're the
[01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:29.380]  number one enemy you're who the NSA is watching you're the people they hate it's
[01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:33.380]  time for everyone to make a decision and decide which side do you stand for
[01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:37.620]  which side are you on the good news is there's a huge awakening to all this but
[01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:41.740]  the larger question is what are some things we can do that a real world to
[01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:46.180]  counter this and we'll talk about that after this break and have jaren nigh

[01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:09.380]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:13.620]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:17.900]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:22.260]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:26.340]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:30.900]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:35.020]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of

[01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:12.460]  that's also a big part of the solution what he's going to be here talking about
[01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:17.660]  what the biggest issue is being awake and the a big part of that is realizing
[01:10:17.660 --> 01:10:21.300]  how much power the individual has the establishment wouldn't be moving to
[01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:25.620]  curtail the internet and openly censor quote conspiracy theories and they give
[01:10:25.620 --> 01:10:31.180]  the example at the White House and FCC of denying man-made global warming or
[01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:36.140]  denying the official story of 9-11 or denying the official story of Oklahoma
[01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:40.620]  City or denying WMDs or they call it a conspiracy theory that China sells
[01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:43.780]  organs when China's on record saying they do these are the things the State
[01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:47.580]  Department and the FCC and the Diverse Cities are at the White House have all
[01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:50.900]  said it's what Cass Sunstein the regulations are has said why would they
[01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:54.460]  want to start shutting down free speech and curtailing talk radio free speech
[01:10:54.460 --> 01:11:02.220]  with the fairness doctrine if that's if we weren't having an effect and I'm
[01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:05.340]  only one person in this fight against the new world order the real power of this
[01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:10.340]  radio broadcast is you taking action and if we're able to expose that the private
[01:11:10.340 --> 01:11:13.660]  central banks orchestrated the collapse if we're able to expose their line about
[01:11:13.660 --> 01:11:18.260]  WMDs with Iran just like they did seven years ago with Iraq if we're able to
[01:11:18.260 --> 01:11:21.540]  expose the fact they're holding his hostage with the open borders and that
[01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:24.980]  it's their policy to have them open their arrogance is what's gonna undo them
[01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:29.580]  that Obama admits he wants the crisis to get worse that they're trying to
[01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:33.140]  bankrupt states with unfunded mandates so they can be federalized and thus
[01:11:33.140 --> 01:11:37.700]  internationalized all of this is admitted and they want you to feel
[01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:41.500]  powerless but ladies and gentlemen I know the power of the individual 15 years
[01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:44.220]  ago when I first got on air I just wanted to fight for the second amendment
[01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:48.660]  be one voice of millions I never had any imagination of even having a radio show
[01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:53.580]  did an access show for a few months local station went to talk they said we'd
[01:11:53.580 --> 01:11:56.420]  like to give you a Saturday show it got a lot of listeners and ratings they gave
[01:11:56.420 --> 01:12:00.860]  me a weekday show then it got syndicated 13 years ago that's another
[01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:04.900]  example when I started info wars.com and prisonpunna.com I had no intention of
[01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:08.620]  them being the number one alternative websites number one and number two in
[01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:14.340]  the world and growing exponentially but it just shows with how if you just start
[01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:18.460]  resisting in a small way that's how you'll get better and there's so many
[01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:23.460]  of us that we're unstoppable if we take action now again think about just what
[01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:27.300]  I've done with the films hundreds and hundreds of millions of free views
[01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:32.180]  online that's what I value is waking people up the Obama deception fall the
[01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:38.020]  republic in game all of these films invisible empire truth rising loose
[01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:42.180]  change final cut that I produced all of that hundreds and hundreds of millions
[01:12:42.180 --> 01:12:46.100]  conservatively I have more than eight YouTube channels with more than a hundred
[01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:49.820]  and fifty million views between them not counting the thousands of other
[01:12:49.820 --> 01:12:53.460]  channels and hundreds of millions of views that's just with YouTube and we
[01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:59.100]  use other tools talk radio everything the news websites think of what we've done
[01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:03.780]  and here's just a few examples of why enemy operatives co until pro are
[01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:08.260]  revealing themselves in the fake patriot movement that is areas that are fake in
[01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:12.900]  the mainstream media multiple builder bird group journalist openly attacking
[01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:16.100]  me every week and international publications saying I'm a dangerous
[01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:19.900]  enemy because I've analyzed their attack profile I know what they're doing and I
[01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:23.460]  know how to stop them now here's just an example of the power of the individual
[01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:29.060]  and how it ties together with you the listeners how it ties together with you
[01:13:29.060 --> 01:13:33.140]  the power the reason this show has power is because I take action we put out
[01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:37.020]  quality information but that's a small part of the equation you magnify at a
[01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:42.260]  billion times no exaggeration a billion times conservatively you magnify what I
[01:13:42.260 --> 01:13:46.380]  do an example of that is I came in here last week and told the crew and then
[01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:49.540]  said on air that it was weird I was listening to a syndicated show out of
[01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:53.820]  San Antonio and they were talking about me in a positive way and then I flipped
[01:13:53.820 --> 01:13:58.260]  the channel to 590 a.m. and the Todd and Don show had a caller call in and said
[01:13:58.260 --> 01:14:01.180]  they want to censor the internet the world government's taking over they want
[01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:04.980]  to shut down Alex Jones and you know the local host made a joke about it but
[01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:10.620]  the point is that that was just in a few minutes of listening I was tuning
[01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:13.980]  channel to channel jaren called me this morning at about 9 he said you won't
[01:14:13.980 --> 01:14:17.820]  believe what just happened to me this morning because he just woken up and he
[01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:22.420]  was dazed by it because every piece of media his cell phone his computer his
[01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:27.500]  radio it was all Alex Jones no matter what he flipped to not twice in a row
[01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:32.460]  three times in a row and that's an example of you the callers just calling
[01:14:32.460 --> 01:14:37.220]  in to talk radio and the type of magnification that it is having and
[01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:42.420]  the buzz that it is creating if we take that model and you do that yourself in
[01:14:42.420 --> 01:14:46.620]  your own town your own city it may just be a buzz on your block it may be a buzz
[01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:51.860]  in your town or your state resistance is victory and I want to go to jaren
[01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:55.260]  nyhart and talk about this jaren I briefly tell folks what happened this
[01:14:55.260 --> 01:14:58.300]  morning yeah actually I woke up about eight o'clock always set my alarm clock
[01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:02.860]  to ninety three seven a local show here in town Dudley and Bob and a caller
[01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:06.860]  actually called in asking if they could get you on the show they're talking about
[01:15:06.860 --> 01:15:11.620]  the FCC ruling the the ruling against the FCC they went on for about five
[01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:15.420]  minutes a year we should have them back in talking about you I turned that off
[01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:19.780]  loaded up the Joe Rogan podcast which is always a staple started listening to
[01:15:19.780 --> 01:15:23.460]  that at the same time I got a text message from my sister saying this is
[01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:27.060]  all at eight o'clock in the morning case 101 another local show here in town was
[01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:31.620]  talking about you as I was reading that I said to myself look I got to go listen
[01:15:31.620 --> 01:15:36.940]  to case 101 see if they're still talking about it and as I did that Joe Rogan's on
[01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:40.940]  his podcast talking about you doing an impression actually but talking about
[01:15:40.940 --> 01:15:44.900]  you and almost short short circled me for a second the thing was he's got
[01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:49.500]  people in on his podcast a UFC guy Eddie Bravo they all talk about you like
[01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:53.580]  just just Alex hey Alex does this Alex says this and everybody seems to know
[01:15:53.580 --> 01:15:57.780]  it was the same thing on KLBJ when I heard it I didn't hear the case 101 part
[01:15:57.780 --> 01:16:01.180]  but they just talk about yeah Alex come then Alex says Alex says this and it's
[01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:05.180]  almost like just a everybody's aware I see it when you know when the dredge
[01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:08.620]  report comes out I didn't even tell you this the other day I Google search every
[01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:12.300]  morning just New World Order global governance to see what articles it comes
[01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:19.180]  up in and two days ago it sent me to a link a TMZ link about Jesse James I had
[01:16:19.180 --> 01:16:23.380]  no relevance to anything and I actually controlled F searched it to see where
[01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:26.580]  New World Order popped up and somebody had posted an info war story in the
[01:16:26.580 --> 01:16:32.020]  comment section by JT Coyote a couple of days ago so it's just everywhere you
[01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:36.580]  turn the message is getting out that's just you know just the the viral nature
[01:16:36.580 --> 01:16:41.420]  of it it's just kind of fascinating but and within about a minute of itself three
[01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:46.580]  times today on three separate radio shows they were talking about you and and
[01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:49.780]  this was one after the other oh yeah I mean you're just like because I mean I'm
[01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:52.940]  in the car and I go to one channel they're talking about me and I and then
[01:16:52.940 --> 01:16:56.060]  and then I flip to another and they're talking about me and I didn't I mean it
[01:16:56.060 --> 01:16:59.900]  was just insane and more and more that's happening and I'm hearing from family
[01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:03.300]  and friends and other parts of the country I'm hearing of people in other
[01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:07.780]  nations I'm hearing in Czechoslovakia and Russia and Japan it's info wars
[01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:13.780]  everywhere and and but but but the issue is it's not about Alex Jones it's about
[01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:17.740]  the power of individuals together with an idea and how ideas are bulletproof
[01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:20.380]  they can kill Alex Jones I've been getting death threats a lot of other
[01:17:20.380 --> 01:17:24.220]  stuff lately but I'm not scared of that my mission is to defeat the New World
[01:17:24.220 --> 01:17:27.900]  Order so my children have a future and so my great great grandchildren can look
[01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:30.860]  at a hologram photo of me or whatever they're looking at in the future and go
[01:17:30.860 --> 01:17:34.380]  you know we're proud of him you know we you know and then and then I could be an
[01:17:34.380 --> 01:17:39.700]  example to them just like my ancestors were an example to me and you know just
[01:17:39.700 --> 01:17:43.220]  like I'm proud of the fact that on my dad's side you know the captain of the
[01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:47.340]  Mayflower you know direct descendant and then two people that got married on the
[01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:50.740]  Mayflower on my mom's side I'm proud that I'm related to a bunch of the famous
[01:17:50.740 --> 01:17:54.900]  people in 1776 a lot of the famous people of course in the war of
[01:17:54.900 --> 01:17:59.780]  independence in Texas and I mean I'm not sitting or tooting my horn everybody
[01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:03.780]  has that in their background I want my ancestors I mean I want to keep living I
[01:18:03.780 --> 01:18:07.140]  don't want to die but I'm actually not even afraid I'm really living this is as
[01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:10.700]  a man I am supposed to stand up for humanity I'm supposed to stand up
[01:18:10.700 --> 01:18:14.340]  against evil I'm not supposed to be a coward and the weird thing is I might
[01:18:14.340 --> 01:18:17.460]  have been scared 15 years ago a little bit maybe scared to get in front of a
[01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:19.580]  crowd more than I was scared to get killed I wouldn't even thinking about
[01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:23.260]  that now I'm not even worried and I kind of got to remember well I want to
[01:18:23.260 --> 01:18:26.140]  continue my mission I need to kind of look over my shoulder I need to still
[01:18:26.140 --> 01:18:30.940]  watch out but I'm not it's such an empowering feeling to know we've got the
[01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:34.500]  truth to know we're having a historic effect and the system is fully aware
[01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:38.020]  that's why they've had two separate journalists and Watson's written about
[01:18:38.020 --> 01:18:42.020]  this in international publications write whole stories about me and how
[01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:47.620]  dangerous I am so literally the global rulers are in their councils saying
[01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:50.940]  we've got to stop Alex Jones but how do we do it do we poisoning do we kill him
[01:18:50.940 --> 01:18:54.220]  no let's destroy him and call him a racist when we never do that then they
[01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:57.660]  have their racist groups their funding that's on record attacking me saying you
[01:18:57.660 --> 01:19:02.140]  know I miss sell out because I'm a racist as if being good as being a racist so
[01:19:02.140 --> 01:19:05.820]  that I mean literally ladies and gentlemen you can do the same thing at

[01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:32.100]  actually to the viral nature of it we had patrice O'Neill on about a year ago

[01:22:25.980 --> 01:22:30.420]  experienced this is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not
[01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:33.860]  accountable to our elected government but has also caused the dollar to lose

[01:24:06.340 --> 01:24:11.780]  my friends the giant effect we've had in the exponential growth curve of our power
[01:24:11.780 --> 01:24:16.940]  to reach people is a great boon for liberty but it's also a danger because
[01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:22.340]  if they can successfully destroy Alex Jones they can attempt to wound the
[01:24:22.340 --> 01:24:26.420]  idea of the resistance and I've always attempted to not be in this leadership
[01:24:26.420 --> 01:24:30.140]  position but there's no denying it and it's it's exponential and I pray every
[01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:34.900]  day that God strengthens me and helps me be somewhat worthy of this position but
[01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:39.780]  all of us are in this special position in this time and space in the time space
[01:24:39.780 --> 01:24:44.140]  continuum of having a serious choice liberty or tyranny I was talking to
[01:24:44.140 --> 01:24:47.700]  Richard Reeves another great activist that I've known for years who's just
[01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:51.340]  gone on with my encouragement and others to just do amazing things he's been to
[01:24:51.340 --> 01:24:57.180]  Bilderberg with us to cover it had a lot of courage there and and and he's seen
[01:24:57.180 --> 01:25:00.980]  the power in the awakening and Obama's approval ratings dropping the pro
[01:25:00.980 --> 01:25:05.660]  establishment Republican losing the primary in Alabama to a patriot that
[01:25:05.660 --> 01:25:10.380]  was just yesterday every incumbent falling by the wayside except for Rick
[01:25:10.380 --> 01:25:14.140]  Perry and he posed as one of us this is happening so I want to get him here
[01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:16.420]  because he's an expert on the realignment that's happening he saw it a
[01:25:16.420 --> 01:25:19.940]  year and a half ago as I did and also on the toll roads because they're going to
[01:25:19.940 --> 01:25:23.180]  have with a nap the superhighways they've just named they've changed the name
[01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:27.740]  these are international zones to raise taxes for these international groups so
[01:25:27.740 --> 01:25:31.460]  are the carbon taxes so we're going to discuss that after the break but Richard
[01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:34.940]  also brought to my attention a chilling Obama quote he said I'm sure you know
[01:25:34.940 --> 01:25:38.260]  about it it came out a week ago or so and I said no I'm not aware of it see
[01:25:38.260 --> 01:25:41.500]  that's why you the listeners and the other activists are so important none of
[01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:45.860]  us can know all of this or even half of it but Richard you know you've heard me
[01:25:45.860 --> 01:25:50.420]  on the show just to say and I know I'm right 100% chance they're going to
[01:25:50.420 --> 01:25:54.260]  fully implode things to a road warrior level many times worse than the Great
[01:25:54.260 --> 01:25:57.460]  Depression they think because we're dependent and they've gotten us dependent
[01:25:57.460 --> 01:26:00.980]  that we'll have to submit to them they're announcing police aren't going to
[01:26:00.980 --> 01:26:05.300]  respond to robberies people being poisoned people being attacked that's
[01:26:05.300 --> 01:26:08.900]  happening all over the country they're training us that your taxes are going up
[01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:12.860]  but we're going to let lawlessness take over the borders lawless Obama says he
[01:26:12.860 --> 01:26:17.500]  wants it lawless to Senator Kyle so people will capitulate I mean but the
[01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:20.540]  good news is they're in troubles people say well what's the solution it's
[01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:23.060]  screaming bloody murder it's saying we know you're doing this deliberately
[01:26:23.060 --> 01:26:27.020]  you're criminals and we know the Republican leadership is involved in it
[01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:31.700]  as well and and just identifying them as the treacherous Larson as traders they
[01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:35.020]  are Richard Reeves give us the state of the Union and the state of the globe
[01:26:35.020 --> 01:26:38.900]  from your research because you're a radio talk show host author researcher
[01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:42.820]  activist one of the key people fighting the trans-Texas corridor well Alex
[01:26:42.820 --> 01:26:47.940]  thank you for having me on and I tell you we are in a definite at the edge of a
[01:26:47.940 --> 01:26:51.060]  cliff right here I think you're right absolutely because they do see the
[01:26:51.060 --> 01:26:54.660]  awakening I think we had the Brzezinski talk about that the global
[01:26:54.660 --> 01:26:58.020]  awakening is going on we had a Henry Kissinger quote come out that if the
[01:26:58.020 --> 01:27:02.380]  euro collapses over in the European Union if that comes apart the New World
[01:27:02.380 --> 01:27:05.460]  Order could be lost right now but I don't think they're ready to give it up
[01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:10.180]  that quick they are definitely ready to potentially pull the plug on us here and
[01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:13.900]  I think one thing we could discuss through the next 30 or so minutes is how
[01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:17.900]  they may play out those scenarios because I don't think they're going to
[01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:20.620]  delay the election I don't think they're gonna play with that I think they're
[01:27:20.620 --> 01:27:25.220]  gonna let that happen and I think what we might see is a lame duck session of
[01:27:25.220 --> 01:27:29.180]  Congress where these guys is kind of like in a foreclosure situation where
[01:27:29.180 --> 01:27:32.820]  some people burn the house down or vandalize it heavily tear out the walls
[01:27:32.820 --> 01:27:37.020]  of plumbing the air conditioner etc we might see that in this lame duck set
[01:27:37.020 --> 01:27:40.300]  that's what the IMF World Bank plan says they did to third-world countries and
[01:27:40.300 --> 01:27:43.860]  they admit they're doing it to Europe in the US and England Australia right so
[01:27:43.860 --> 01:27:46.700]  that's what I'm real concerned about is that lame duck session but nonetheless
[01:27:46.700 --> 01:27:50.780]  we've got to do what we've got to do earlier you were talking about how that
[01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:55.940]  you were getting all the media coverage and the talk about Alex Jones info wars
[01:27:55.940 --> 01:27:59.820]  and the Patriot Movement Tea Party etc was just blowing up well that's one
[01:27:59.820 --> 01:28:06.100]  thing that I've noticed that years ago back in the late 90s early 2000 stories
[01:28:06.100 --> 01:28:09.700]  that were discussed here in the alternative media sometimes took the
[01:28:09.700 --> 01:28:13.980]  mainstream media two three four five years in some cases they didn't talk
[01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:17.660]  about a story that we talked about it may be too now they admit on Fox and CNN
[01:28:17.660 --> 01:28:21.780]  Prozac does cause brain cancer and heart attacks they admit okay it is causing
[01:28:21.780 --> 01:28:25.740]  miscarriages and for babies to be underweight and deformed with the
[01:28:25.740 --> 01:28:29.460]  aspartame which we knew back in the 70s that was in the studies I mean exactly
[01:28:29.460 --> 01:28:33.780]  it's just kind of out there now well when it comes to the political realities of
[01:28:33.780 --> 01:28:37.380]  this world the zeitgeist of it is flying right through this office because
[01:28:37.380 --> 01:28:42.700]  it's like just yesterday on USA Today yesterday front page full body scanners
[01:28:42.700 --> 01:28:46.180]  being protested against right there on the front page they're talking about a
[01:28:46.180 --> 01:28:50.620]  story where full body scanners at the airports that people are upset meeting
[01:28:50.620 --> 01:28:55.260]  massive resistance and it's him and I have another report here freeway speed
[01:28:55.260 --> 01:28:59.940]  cameras to be turned off this is out of the Arizona newspaper Arizona Republic
[01:28:59.940 --> 01:29:05.620]  and it says because almost everyone refused to pay over 90% of people refused
[01:29:05.620 --> 01:29:09.060]  to pay the tickets right so that's what's gonna take it's gonna take some
[01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:14.580]  civil disobedience at some point but I think we still have just by hanging by
[01:29:14.580 --> 01:29:17.700]  thread we've got the voting still hanging by thread we had the Rand Paul
[01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:22.420]  victory we've got other victories that have happened in these primaries like

[01:33:39.060 --> 01:33:42.900]  globalist onslaught that's how they take down old world and first world nations

[01:36:51.740 --> 01:36:57.060]  couldn't have done any of this in the last 15 years without you okay and the
[01:36:57.060 --> 01:37:00.380]  globalist gonna try to confuse you on the web and get you to end fight and I
[01:37:00.380 --> 01:37:04.460]  sort of love about Richard he's immune to it and and and distract off and make
[01:37:04.460 --> 01:37:08.900]  the fight about a fight with each other instead of waking more people up it's a
[01:37:08.900 --> 01:37:13.020]  life-and-death situation and I want to commend all of you because we are
[01:37:13.020 --> 01:37:16.740]  kicking the globalist hind in but the problem is the Empire is now striking
[01:37:16.740 --> 01:37:21.420]  back Richard you got the floor about the Kissinger quote this Obama clip the
[01:37:21.420 --> 01:37:25.580]  toll roads everything we're gonna talk about solutions but also who the enemy
[01:37:25.580 --> 01:37:29.620]  is right now what do you want to cover first well first of all I want to back
[01:37:29.620 --> 01:37:33.620]  up what you just said info warrior is essential right now because if we have
[01:37:33.620 --> 01:37:37.060]  this economic collapse you're talking about and that I think very well could
[01:37:37.060 --> 01:37:41.780]  be coming as well we need to have our neighbors knowing who's really the
[01:37:41.780 --> 01:37:45.780]  culprit you know is it the middle class is it the the guy down the street no
[01:37:45.780 --> 01:37:50.020]  it's not it's the global elite that's doing this economic hit on the United
[01:37:50.020 --> 01:37:54.740]  States so we need to info warrior times two times ten whatever you're doing now
[01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:59.540]  folks amp it up and the New World Order they fund their operation out of thin
[01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:04.580]  air paper and ink in zeros and ones in the computer that doesn't even exist in
[01:38:04.580 --> 01:38:09.460]  reality that's how they fund their efforts folks Alex needs help to fund
[01:38:09.460 --> 01:38:13.260]  these efforts and continue this going on all right I tell you one of the quotes
[01:38:13.260 --> 01:38:16.180]  I thought you'd be real interested with his oil well situation is Mikhail
[01:38:16.180 --> 01:38:20.540]  Gorbachev the threat of environmental crisis will be the international
[01:38:20.540 --> 01:38:25.060]  disaster key that will unlock the New World Order so that plays right into
[01:38:25.060 --> 01:38:29.020]  this all that was published in newspapers that was a 1988 quote way back
[01:38:29.020 --> 01:38:34.660]  from 88 supposedly December UN General Assembly read that again the threat and
[01:38:34.660 --> 01:38:38.780]  I would say the the implementation is probably the new word there but the
[01:38:38.780 --> 01:38:42.900]  threat of environmental crisis will be the international disaster key that
[01:38:42.900 --> 01:38:47.580]  will unlock the New World Order Marie Strong quote the environmental crisis
[01:38:47.580 --> 01:38:53.300]  is the cornerstone of the New World Order so Al Gore Marie Strong and Mikhail
[01:38:53.300 --> 01:38:57.060]  Gorbachev are the three musketeers of the environmental movement so the New
[01:38:57.060 --> 01:39:00.540]  World Order is using that leg right now but there's other legs obviously going
[01:39:00.540 --> 01:39:03.860]  on besides the environmental crisis but I thought with this oil well spilling out
[01:39:03.860 --> 01:39:09.460]  in the gulf that notice it's BP very timely very timely situation and also to
[01:39:09.460 --> 01:39:13.180]  back up how you started the show today which was your warning about that it
[01:39:13.180 --> 01:39:16.340]  looks like they're really gonna potentially pull the plug here in the
[01:39:16.340 --> 01:39:19.180]  upcoming months we're already in a depression but I mean total collapse
[01:39:19.180 --> 01:39:25.540]  potentially total collapse and Obama at the G20 summit I heard this quote a
[01:39:25.540 --> 01:39:30.660]  couple times on mainstream news he's warning of that he's gonna present very
[01:39:30.660 --> 01:39:35.940]  difficult choices to the country next year so if the guys got that little and
[01:39:35.940 --> 01:39:38.140]  before he played that's what I was saying earlier they think we're
[01:39:38.140 --> 01:39:42.540]  domesticated they they've done the math and know that 90% of people you know
[01:39:42.540 --> 01:39:45.460]  aren't self-sufficient and are dependent one way or the other on the
[01:39:45.460 --> 01:39:49.140]  government even if they don't work for the government and so they decided to
[01:39:49.140 --> 01:39:53.260]  bankrupt everything to say and I here's your choice fully submit to us and we
[01:39:53.260 --> 01:39:57.060]  know what that means so tell us about this clip we're about to see well it's a
[01:39:57.060 --> 01:40:00.540]  G20 clip when Obama was there and remember he was encouraging other
[01:40:00.540 --> 01:40:05.220]  nations he was encouraging other nations to keep up the stimulus right that
[01:40:05.220 --> 01:40:08.980]  means get more into the bankers but but but then he went further he also said in
[01:40:08.980 --> 01:40:13.540]  a clip that no nation be above any other but that means lowering everyone with the
[01:40:13.540 --> 01:40:17.060]  bankers above us so let's go ahead and play that clip there we go you know one
[01:40:17.060 --> 01:40:20.420]  of the interesting things that's happened over the last 18 months as
[01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:26.260]  president is for some reason people keep on being surprised when I do what I
[01:40:26.260 --> 01:40:33.460]  said I was gonna do so I say I'm gonna reform our health care system and
[01:40:33.460 --> 01:40:38.140]  people think well gosh that's not smart politics maybe we should hold off or I
[01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:44.020]  say we're gonna move forward on don't ask don't tell them somehow people say
[01:40:44.020 --> 01:40:47.940]  you know well why are you doing that you know I'm not sure that's a good
[01:40:47.940 --> 01:40:52.180]  politics I'm doing it because I said I was gonna do it and I think it's the
[01:40:52.180 --> 01:40:57.900]  right thing to do and your people should learn that lesson about me because
[01:40:57.900 --> 01:41:04.860]  next year when I start presenting some very difficult choices to the country
[01:41:04.860 --> 01:41:10.540]  you know I hope some of these folks who are hollering about deficits and debt
[01:41:10.540 --> 01:41:21.660]  step up because I'm calling their bluff and we'll see how much of that how much
[01:41:21.660 --> 01:41:25.460]  of the political arguments they're making right now are real and how much of
[01:41:25.460 --> 01:41:31.820]  it was just politics all right thank you very much everybody boy your take on
[01:41:31.820 --> 01:41:36.180]  that oh it's well the headline on that on YouTube was Obama cryptic cryptidly
[01:41:36.180 --> 01:41:39.300]  presents very difficult choices to the country next year well that's before
[01:41:39.300 --> 01:41:44.140]  when he first got elected that's what Biden said he said he's gonna do some
[01:41:44.140 --> 01:41:47.220]  things that are gonna make people hate us and what they do is all the taxes are
[01:41:47.220 --> 01:41:50.180]  gonna go to debt they're gonna get rid of the police the welfare they're gonna
[01:41:50.180 --> 01:41:53.300]  slash it all they're gonna take pensions and that's gonna be the tough
[01:41:53.300 --> 01:41:56.660]  choice and we see Republicans in the Washington Times saying yes we need to
[01:41:56.660 --> 01:42:00.060]  raise the retirement age to 70 and we need to start taking part of people's
[01:42:00.060 --> 01:42:04.100]  pension funds so the bankers are gonna get everything they're gonna have record
[01:42:04.100 --> 01:42:07.100]  products like they've had the last two years we're gonna have nothing well and
[01:42:07.100 --> 01:42:10.580]  we got to remember he was addressing the g20 audience people that they're
[01:42:10.580 --> 01:42:15.180]  basically in the know what's going on so what I think he's anticipating is I
[01:42:15.180 --> 01:42:18.540]  think he's anticipating that in this general election in November we're
[01:42:18.540 --> 01:42:23.700]  gonna see a lot of incumbents get tossed out probably portion almost certain
[01:42:23.700 --> 01:42:26.820]  that we're gonna get a Republican majority in the house maybe in the Senate
[01:42:26.820 --> 01:42:30.820]  as well 11 senators are gone already from attrition either they've died or
[01:42:30.820 --> 01:42:35.860]  retired or whatever you got 40 US House members that are gone already because
[01:42:35.860 --> 01:42:41.060]  they have stepped out of the of the fire here so we've got a chance to see in
[01:42:41.060 --> 01:42:46.620]  20 30% new faces potentially in these upcoming and most of these faces we
[01:42:46.620 --> 01:42:50.140]  know are bona fide patriots and so the globalists are gonna have trouble
[01:42:50.140 --> 01:42:55.340]  getting them under control and it's exponential either way you slice it I
[01:42:55.340 --> 01:42:59.540]  mean did you hear me read from the Financial Times of London top Clinton
[01:42:59.540 --> 01:43:04.060]  official only a terror attack can save Obama I mean the story alone we five
[01:43:04.060 --> 01:43:06.980]  years ago we talk about this for a month straight these things are coming out on
[01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:11.700]  an hourly basis right it's crazy how fast things are happening how fast things
[01:43:11.700 --> 01:43:14.340]  are coming out is that quote that you say all the time that sometimes things
[01:43:14.340 --> 01:43:18.460]  happen in a year that happened in 100 years that rapidly but I think they're
[01:43:18.460 --> 01:43:22.860]  anticipating this big change in the House and Senate and so Obama is gonna
[01:43:22.860 --> 01:43:28.140]  set the new freshman up for a fall they're gonna come in and want to see
[01:43:28.140 --> 01:43:32.540]  fiscal responsibility implemented even though as we've your caller stated
[01:43:32.540 --> 01:43:36.660]  earlier in the last few days that the new world order has a laden's lamp when
[01:43:36.660 --> 01:43:41.820]  it comes to creating money well the there's gonna be a desire for fiscal
[01:43:41.820 --> 01:43:45.660]  responsibility by the new freshman coming in and so he may let that happen
[01:43:45.660 --> 01:43:50.220]  to a more hideous degree than even they want and then then then he's got
[01:43:50.220 --> 01:43:53.580]  somebody to point the finger notice all the leftist controlled areas have got
[01:43:53.580 --> 01:43:59.380]  you know record amounts of money but what did you think about Oakland saying
[01:43:59.380 --> 01:44:02.420]  we're gonna restrict guns more so you can't have those protect yourself but
[01:44:02.420 --> 01:44:05.580]  we're going to this is a police chief this is what he released you're allowed
[01:44:05.580 --> 01:44:09.060]  to administer poison to someone we will not respond if someone's poisoned
[01:44:09.060 --> 01:44:13.980]  extortion burglary theft embezzlement grand theft I mean it just goes on and
[01:44:13.980 --> 01:44:21.180]  on sabotaging power lines I mean this is insane and we'll put that list on
[01:44:21.180 --> 01:44:25.540]  screen if you scroll down on the NBC article this is his list and and that's
[01:44:25.540 --> 01:44:29.620]  a green light to the criminals to just go haywire right right and so that's what
[01:44:29.620 --> 01:44:32.820]  could happen is when we get this Mad Max scenario that you referred to earlier in
[01:44:32.820 --> 01:44:36.300]  the show then that's gonna put all of us in danger that are trying to you know
[01:44:36.300 --> 01:44:40.700]  maintain our house payment and drive our cars and go to work etc so it could be
[01:44:40.700 --> 01:44:45.580]  very and they're gonna offer the new SDR and say we'll jack the dollar up for you
[01:44:45.580 --> 01:44:48.460]  for a while because under this SDR the globals will fully run the dollar off
[01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:51.780]  shore now it'll still be there it's just they control it and then now you'll have
[01:44:51.780 --> 01:44:56.820]  this SDR a digital currency above that and that's gonna be their answer global
[01:44:56.820 --> 01:44:59.700]  government will fix this and if we capitulate and roll over they'll turn
[01:44:59.700 --> 01:45:03.580]  the economy back on for a few years well and but you know we're gonna have to go
[01:45:03.580 --> 01:45:06.460]  through this that's what we got to figure out is how to transition from this
[01:45:06.460 --> 01:45:11.420]  funny money Federal Reserve system to a real constitutional money system that's
[01:45:11.420 --> 01:45:14.860]  what they covered that's a very ugly path unfortunately potentially but that
[01:45:14.860 --> 01:45:17.380]  does that's what that's the route we need to go now I want to get into toll
[01:45:17.380 --> 01:45:20.940]  roads but but but first some more of them keep you five minutes the next hour
[01:45:20.940 --> 01:45:23.660]  we need to Richard can you have key info on the toll road so I wanted to get
[01:45:23.660 --> 01:45:27.460]  you here why I called you but I want to go back to this we you read the IMF
[01:45:27.460 --> 01:45:31.660]  hundred I think was 112 points was 2002 it got leaked and it's the shock
[01:45:31.660 --> 01:45:35.460]  therapy doctrine got released Joseph Stiglitz left and it magically got leaked
[01:45:35.460 --> 01:45:39.260]  the Nobel Prize winner and he's a pretty good guy we've had him on and he says
[01:45:39.260 --> 01:45:43.300]  they plan to destroy everything and it's total collapse and in there you know the
[01:45:43.300 --> 01:45:47.060]  IMF would say go into Argentina this was the one example there they just done
[01:45:47.060 --> 01:45:51.620]  it two years before in 2000 this is 2002 we're going back to and they said what
[01:45:51.620 --> 01:45:56.180]  we do is we quadruple the price of oil and water we put toll roads on
[01:45:56.180 --> 01:46:00.700]  everything that further bankrupts it then the people riot confidence is lost
[01:46:00.700 --> 01:46:07.660]  and then you have to make things a lot worse it's basically take them a hundred
[01:46:07.660 --> 01:46:12.060]  miles down the road we push back 50 but still they've got 50 miles on us so they
[01:46:12.060 --> 01:46:16.620]  know that to make it super bad so that then we fight back get a little bit back
[01:46:16.620 --> 01:46:20.860]  and think we won when really our standard of living's been dropped by 20 30 40 50
[01:46:20.860 --> 01:46:25.180]  percent which morey strong in the UN and Al Gore say is their goal the carbon
[01:46:25.180 --> 01:46:29.060]  tax is to destroy our industrial society to make us dependent China India and
[01:46:29.060 --> 01:46:33.060]  others are exempt they're the new globalist command base and so they're
[01:46:33.060 --> 01:46:37.180]  going to wreck things so bad so that artificially so that then when they
[01:46:37.180 --> 01:46:40.620]  turn things back on it'll be a lot worse than it is now but we'll think oh my
[01:46:40.620 --> 01:46:44.180]  god at least I've got food at least the power zone at least the waters flowing
[01:46:44.180 --> 01:46:48.500]  and in the IMF World Bank plans they they they say how they do it I mean we
[01:46:48.500 --> 01:46:52.020]  they're doing that here this is going to happen they are and Richard how do we
[01:46:52.020 --> 01:46:55.340]  stop it I know they're engineering it I know they're executing it I have their
[01:46:55.340 --> 01:46:58.780]  playbook I mean it's not like I'm I just realized now they're really going for
[01:46:58.780 --> 01:47:02.740]  everything they are going to hammer us into nothing and and I just want people
[01:47:02.740 --> 01:47:07.860]  to understand this well one way stop it you did the plug orders get those
[01:47:07.860 --> 01:47:11.140]  videos in the hands of as many people as possible but the other things we can do
[01:47:11.140 --> 01:47:14.140]  is we still got elections coming up primaries unfortunately the Texas
[01:47:14.140 --> 01:47:17.820]  primaries already passed we don't get another shot at firing incumbents till
[01:47:17.820 --> 01:47:23.740]  November but in Oklahoma in Oklahoma we've got we've got Randy Brogdon that
[01:47:23.740 --> 01:47:28.760]  has a good chance to run to get into the governor's primary in the Republican
[01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:33.700]  Party Randy Brogdon his website Randy Brogdon com he might be worthy of an
[01:47:33.700 --> 01:47:38.460]  interview I think because he's a really good guy and he's polling around 40
[01:47:38.460 --> 01:47:42.700]  percent in some of these mainstream monkey polls so he's looking really good
[01:47:42.700 --> 01:47:48.060]  there and plus that creates a definite roadblock for the NAFTA corridor for the
[01:47:48.060 --> 01:47:50.940]  trans-Texas corridor they got to go through Oklahoma there's 83 of these
[01:47:50.940 --> 01:47:55.660]  mega highways they want but the key and they admit for the whole country to merge
[01:47:55.660 --> 01:48:00.460]  into is the trans-Texas I-35 mega corridor all the way into the north of
[01:48:00.460 --> 01:48:04.660]  Canada all the way down to the port on the Pacific side in southern Mexico
[01:48:04.660 --> 01:48:10.140]  right Laredo Texas is the largest inland port in the United States Laredo
[01:48:10.140 --> 01:48:14.380]  Texas largest inland port so absolutely the trans-Texas corridor is a
[01:48:14.380 --> 01:48:20.140]  cornerstone keystone piece of the NAFTA quarter it's their death star we blow
[01:48:20.140 --> 01:48:23.820]  that politically they're still gonna have star destroyers we blown their main
[01:48:23.820 --> 01:48:27.500]  fleet well in November we're gonna chance to fire every get a chance to fire
[01:48:27.500 --> 01:48:32.060]  every incoming in Texas that we possibly can that's our best hope to make
[01:48:32.060 --> 01:48:37.060]  changes here politically in Texas up in November and then up in Oklahoma we've
[01:48:37.060 --> 01:48:41.620]  got Randy Brogdon like I said we've got RJ Harris another candidate for US rep
[01:48:41.620 --> 01:48:46.620]  that's got a good chance up there and then we've got James Lane Lane for okay
[01:48:46.620 --> 01:48:50.500]  Senate comm James Lane is running for Oklahoma there are hundreds of Patriot
[01:48:50.500 --> 01:48:52.900]  candidates people should find them in their areas and break their backs
[01:48:52.900 --> 01:48:56.420]  supporting them now let's tell people what the NAFTA highways do and then a
[01:48:56.420 --> 01:49:01.340]  microcosm example seizing Mopac which is admittedly illegal to put a total on
[01:49:01.340 --> 01:49:05.380]  existing road every time when they try it we fight back they with they retracted
[01:49:05.380 --> 01:49:09.700]  their back let's use Mopac as a microcosm well with Mopac see the
[01:49:09.700 --> 01:49:13.900]  engineers that originally designed and built that figured that a lot more of
[01:49:13.900 --> 01:49:17.860]  that traffic on Mopac would just be having downtown Austin there as their
[01:49:17.860 --> 01:49:22.140]  destination but as you well know with I-35 being congested so badly so many
[01:49:22.140 --> 01:49:27.300]  hours of the day then Mopac has become a big through route through Austin now and
[01:49:27.300 --> 01:49:31.180]  what they've done though is when they engineered that Lady Bird Lake Bridge
[01:49:31.180 --> 01:49:35.420]  used to be Town Lake Bridge when they engineered that there's a lane that
[01:49:35.420 --> 01:49:39.460]  drops off on southbound and northbound side so the good there's a little bit of
[01:49:39.460 --> 01:49:43.540]  good news in this the good news is they're gonna add a third through lane
[01:49:43.540 --> 01:49:47.980]  both north and southbound on that bridge I did call Kirk Watson's office last
[01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:51.060]  week after I heard you mentioned can't believe already says though it well I
[01:49:51.060 --> 01:49:54.540]  got this from Sandy so we'll see hopefully they live up to it and as I
[01:49:54.540 --> 01:49:58.180]  understand they're already working in restriping well it should be a free road
[01:49:58.180 --> 01:50:01.220]  we've already paid for it should be completely free road three lane Kirk
[01:50:01.220 --> 01:50:04.340]  Watson is as crooked as a barrel of snakes I tell you I've got problems with
[01:50:04.340 --> 01:50:09.540]  Kirk Watson myself but three lanes each way all the way through is what it's
[01:50:09.540 --> 01:50:12.780]  supposed to be when they get through restriping now what they are planning on
[01:50:12.780 --> 01:50:16.740]  still doing is that fourth additional lane call the managed lane that's gonna
[01:50:16.740 --> 01:50:21.340]  be a toll road lane and potentially that'll help Mopak marginally but it'll
[01:50:21.340 --> 01:50:28.100]  create a bureaucracy that will continue to fight to keep I-35 in gridlock I mean
[01:50:28.100 --> 01:50:32.180]  here we are we've got SH-130 that runs to our east that's supposed to be our
[01:50:32.180 --> 01:50:37.500]  bypass here in Austin very underutilized millions of Austinite taxpayer
[01:50:37.500 --> 01:50:40.940]  dollars the point is they hold this hostage they won't build the roads and
[01:50:40.940 --> 01:50:44.540]  then they want to give it to foreign companies to loot us and the way I've
[01:50:44.540 --> 01:50:49.100]  read the law is it's illegal to put toll roads on existing roads well it is but
[01:50:49.100 --> 01:50:52.700]  they parse those words they'll say well we're gonna have these new lanes and so
[01:50:52.700 --> 01:50:56.220]  the existing road was the lanes that you had and how are you gonna exit off those
[01:50:56.220 --> 01:51:00.660]  well that's yet to see exactly it's impossible it's impossible the
[01:51:00.660 --> 01:51:05.420]  engineers have said so listen up folks this is important Alex Jones here now

[01:54:06.900 --> 01:54:11.220]  you take him all the man
[01:54:13.420 --> 01:54:18.940]  and put him in control we got Richard for a few more segments and Larry Pratt's
[01:54:18.940 --> 01:54:21.900]  coming on for about 30 we'll take a few final calls towards the end of the next
[01:54:21.900 --> 01:54:26.340]  hour and get some other news I haven't covered yet but the establishment is
[01:54:26.340 --> 01:54:29.340]  going to promote lawlessness and the collapse to bring in their control
[01:54:29.340 --> 01:54:33.500]  but getting back to to toll roads they always claim they're not going to put
[01:54:33.500 --> 01:54:36.900]  them in when resistance mounts and then they come back later and do put them in
[01:54:36.900 --> 01:54:40.820]  they've claimed over and over again no toll roads from opac 183 it's the same
[01:54:40.820 --> 01:54:45.700]  story where there's Indiana New Jersey over and over again and we know that
[01:54:45.700 --> 01:54:49.500]  these are sweetheart deals with these foreign companies I mean this is not
[01:54:49.500 --> 01:54:53.460]  privatization this is looting but from your deep research on toll roads I mean
[01:54:53.460 --> 01:54:56.740]  look at how a year and a half ago they announced okay no no trans-Texas corridor
[01:54:56.740 --> 01:55:00.000]  we're going to cancel it then the same article in the AP said we're just going
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:03.860]  to do it project by project and not call it that now so they play these
[01:55:03.860 --> 01:55:09.500]  semantical games so we don't have a united front of enemies to go after well
[01:55:09.500 --> 01:55:13.260]  Alex you know we really have slowed them down and we've damaged them but they
[01:55:13.260 --> 01:55:16.260]  are definitely not gone and they've got that Aladdin's lamp of money that they
[01:55:16.260 --> 01:55:19.700]  want to keep pouring into this the road builders are chomping at the bit for
[01:55:19.700 --> 01:55:24.340]  that money so they are going to continue like you said wanting to build these
[01:55:24.340 --> 01:55:27.500]  toll roads they want to milk the US people out of all the money they can
[01:55:27.500 --> 01:55:30.940]  get and the ones that they can't milk on being on the toll roads they're just
[01:55:30.940 --> 01:55:34.540]  going to put them on foot that's part of their plan to reduce congestion for the
[01:55:34.540 --> 01:55:37.780]  first time we knew it was the policy in the last 20 years but the head of the
[01:55:37.780 --> 01:55:40.540]  department transportation said the New York Times what a few months ago that
[01:55:40.540 --> 01:55:44.940]  they're anti-car but but America's designed for cars we're not compact
[01:55:44.940 --> 01:55:49.020]  Europe or Tokyo I think Chicago and New York are probably the only cities that
[01:55:49.020 --> 01:55:52.620]  you can really get by without a car well they know that though this is this is
[01:55:52.620 --> 01:55:56.460]  about bankrupting everybody it is I mean I mean the Pentagon designed the roads
[01:55:56.460 --> 01:55:59.700]  we've gotten the 50s they make us all dependent on it then they try to take it
[01:55:59.700 --> 01:56:03.580]  away well I've been in the transportation business over 30 years now and I'm
[01:56:03.580 --> 01:56:08.020]  seeing more and more people be priced out of their cars literally when we had
[01:56:08.020 --> 01:56:12.900]  the price hike of $4 gallon gas they're briefly back in 2008 people were
[01:56:12.900 --> 01:56:16.220]  literally bailing out their cars and riding taxes and buses because they
[01:56:16.220 --> 01:56:20.060]  could not afford to gas so even as expensive as a taxi was they were
[01:56:20.060 --> 01:56:24.300]  preferring that over driving their own vehicle so they've definitely got these
[01:56:24.300 --> 01:56:29.740]  plans to put people back on their feet as a matter of fact one guy jokingly
[01:56:29.740 --> 01:56:34.500]  said during a central Texas meeting recent two or three years ago he said
[01:56:34.500 --> 01:56:39.060]  that I'd like to see tolls on trails you know put tolls on trails and make
[01:56:39.060 --> 01:56:43.020]  people pay for walking so that's the full intention that they have at some
[01:56:43.020 --> 01:56:46.320]  point if they can well I mean we always joke what's the new tax a tax on air
[01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:50.220]  that's now they that's the New York Times headline a tax on air that's carbon
[01:56:50.220 --> 01:56:53.700]  dioxide that's what Bill Gates said we're gonna tax you for breathing which
[01:56:53.700 --> 01:56:58.260]  by the way fellow Texans on Texas turf.org Terry Hall's website that she's
[01:56:58.260 --> 01:57:01.860]  always breaking down the toll road issues got stories on there there's a
[01:57:01.860 --> 01:57:05.500]  story on there right now how that highway lobby wants every kind of tax
[01:57:05.500 --> 01:57:10.540]  possible to build roads with now they want toll roads they want additional
[01:57:10.540 --> 01:57:15.060]  gasoline taxes they want sales tax money they want to dip into property tax
[01:57:15.060 --> 01:57:19.780]  money they want to dip into every possible tax to help fund building these
[01:57:19.780 --> 01:57:23.500]  highways so that's what we have to look and they always lie and say cuz gas
[01:57:23.500 --> 01:57:27.300]  receipts are going to go down they've gone up they're lying about not having
[01:57:27.300 --> 01:57:31.060]  money well you know we may have had might have had a small leveling off like
[01:57:31.060 --> 01:57:36.340]  around 08 when we had the big $4 gallon price tag but basically you're right
[01:57:36.340 --> 01:57:40.980]  even in down times we still get more people still driving more cars covering
[01:57:40.980 --> 01:57:44.940]  more miles collecting more gasoline taxes the state of Texas sends billions
[01:57:44.940 --> 01:57:49.660]  of dollars every year and over the past decades multi billions of dollars well
[01:57:49.660 --> 01:57:53.140]  the point is this in Europe they've admitted this and IBM's promoting this
[01:57:53.140 --> 01:57:57.100]  we're gonna be taxed on all roads off your license plate with license plate
[01:57:57.100 --> 01:58:00.740]  readers I tell people this five years ago they'd laugh at me now you go on most
[01:58:00.740 --> 01:58:04.140]  the toll roads in Europe in the US there's no toll booth if they just charge
[01:58:04.140 --> 01:58:08.480]  you off your off your license plate this is they've already got a test in
[01:58:08.480 --> 01:58:11.900]  Texas going where people get a transponder in their car that tracks them
[01:58:11.900 --> 01:58:18.180]  in taxism this is your cars are gonna be turned into you know basically tax cab
[01:58:18.180 --> 01:58:22.260]  a taxi cab and notice your taxes go up but they say we got to get rid of cops
[01:58:22.260 --> 01:58:25.820]  they can't respond to burglary well and the best example to look at is just
[01:58:25.820 --> 01:58:30.540]  type into search engine and look at Singapore roads and study Singapore
[01:58:30.540 --> 01:58:35.180]  toll roads and Singapore tolls they've got a hundred percent tax on just
[01:58:35.180 --> 01:58:38.980]  importing a car if I remember right now stay there I mean it's all a rip off to
[01:58:38.980 --> 01:58:42.620]  the elites they're robbing you it's served them

[02:00:06.220 --> 02:00:13.980]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:13.980 --> 02:00:21.500]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:21.500 --> 02:00:27.380]  Alex Jones Richard Reeves talk show host great political activist here in
[02:00:27.380 --> 02:00:30.460]  Austin Texas and five more minutes and then Larry Pratt's coming up about 30
[02:00:30.460 --> 02:00:33.940]  then on damn it some phone calls phones aren't open yet no folks want to recap
[02:00:33.940 --> 02:00:36.700]  the top stories I mean I laid it out at the start of the broadcast this is the
[02:00:36.700 --> 02:00:40.220]  most important time in our history we're facing and there's no doubt they're
[02:00:40.220 --> 02:00:44.940]  gonna slam us into a total depression to try to break our will and basically
[02:00:44.940 --> 02:00:48.820]  domesticate us and that's just the beginning of their endgame but Richard
[02:00:48.820 --> 02:00:53.260]  in the last five minutes we've got left recap and go more into how you see them
[02:00:53.260 --> 02:00:57.460]  breaking our will with the things they're doing right now well the big
[02:00:57.460 --> 02:01:01.500]  thing they do is just keep on raising our taxes any way possible that's a big
[02:01:01.500 --> 02:01:04.580]  way they do it and of course the media has been doing their job and you've
[02:01:04.580 --> 02:01:08.700]  covered it so well about the LeBron James and Lindsay Lohan and all this so
[02:01:08.700 --> 02:01:12.380]  they just continue with their dumbing down at the education level and the
[02:01:12.380 --> 02:01:18.500]  public indoctrination centers etc. I see them firing on all their weapons
[02:01:18.500 --> 02:01:22.180]  pretty much except you know hopefully not military weapons here but you've got
[02:01:22.180 --> 02:01:27.100]  these environmental disasters so the question is now at what point will they
[02:01:27.100 --> 02:01:31.220]  stop at what point will they back off and that's where we've got no choice but
[02:01:31.220 --> 02:01:35.620]  to go in as some of those analogies you've made in the past where like we're
[02:01:35.620 --> 02:01:39.060]  flying with X-wing fighters into the Death Star we've got to go in and we've
[02:01:39.060 --> 02:01:43.540]  got to fight them at every level that we can politically info warrior every
[02:01:43.540 --> 02:01:48.220]  little thing people do is so important because people get confused I think well
[02:01:48.220 --> 02:01:50.860]  this is all about Obama getting reelected they could care less about him
[02:01:50.860 --> 02:01:55.540]  he's not the the power structure and so they're more than happy to see him
[02:01:55.540 --> 02:01:58.940]  destroyed they'll just move forward we must put the blame on the criminal
[02:01:58.940 --> 02:02:02.980]  elite the ruling class right the ruling class and how do we get to them that's
[02:02:02.980 --> 02:02:06.740]  a that's a good question you've talked about trying to and have indictments and
[02:02:06.740 --> 02:02:11.220]  have jury trials etc. and that's definitely a way we need to go but we
[02:02:11.220 --> 02:02:15.260]  need to have some political cloud up there to initiate this we've got to have
[02:02:15.260 --> 02:02:19.020]  judges we'll that's why they have the Bilderberg group writers the actually
[02:02:19.020 --> 02:02:23.420]  attacking me it's very spooky because Ron and Ron Paul because we call for
[02:02:23.420 --> 02:02:26.620]  grand juries to indict them we're actually pointing at the real power
[02:02:26.620 --> 02:02:30.380]  structure not their puppets and they don't like that I mean folks this is
[02:02:30.380 --> 02:02:34.660]  death defying what we're doing well when we had exactly it's like we're on a
[02:02:34.660 --> 02:02:39.500]  high wire act is exactly right and we've got 500 feet up and no net that's what
[02:02:39.500 --> 02:02:43.660]  we're going into so that's why we need every tightrope walker we can get and we
[02:02:43.660 --> 02:02:48.500]  especially need Alex Jones slash Ron Paul types in political office at every
[02:02:48.500 --> 02:02:52.220]  level from dog catcher to senator to governor so our people are everywhere not
[02:02:52.220 --> 02:02:57.700]  even as a majority yet but to watch and to expose corruption everything you do
[02:02:57.700 --> 02:03:01.900]  is life and death now at this point it is and I tell you I'm thinking that we're
[02:03:01.900 --> 02:03:06.900]  swinging 10 to 20% of the vote if we were organized enough to at least vote
[02:03:06.900 --> 02:03:10.300]  against incumbents in these elections who knows how many people we could turn
[02:03:10.300 --> 02:03:15.820]  over and in that big influx of new people we're gonna hurt in quite a few
[02:03:15.820 --> 02:03:19.740]  patriot candidates at all these different levels of candidacy all over the
[02:03:19.740 --> 02:03:22.260]  country and that's it like you said there's so many they're running
[02:03:22.260 --> 02:03:26.980]  everywhere and in 2012 Lord willing that we get that far we're gonna have even
[02:03:26.980 --> 02:03:30.340]  more so Richard I'm gonna make this final point that have you close out your
[02:03:30.340 --> 02:03:33.820]  statement and appreciate you being here that I'd always seen it in the last four
[02:03:33.820 --> 02:03:37.300]  years it's really scary that the elite were all moving out of the US and they're
[02:03:37.300 --> 02:03:42.060]  even leaving Israel and even leaving England and moving to offshore armored
[02:03:42.060 --> 02:03:44.780]  islands I kind of saw it as a negative like they were gonna destroy us which
[02:03:44.780 --> 02:03:50.020]  they are but that's kind of good because it looks like they're just trying to
[02:03:50.020 --> 02:03:53.260]  steal everything and now they may realize they're gonna finally get kicked
[02:03:53.260 --> 02:03:57.580]  out well it's looking like they're gonna have to self-eject because they may not
[02:03:57.580 --> 02:04:00.860]  have any choice and like you said many of them over the years you said that many
[02:04:00.860 --> 02:04:04.180]  of them have already gotten their place in the Cayman Islands or wherever they
[02:04:04.180 --> 02:04:09.740]  go to but the New World Order is definitely it's global that's global so
[02:04:09.740 --> 02:04:12.020]  I don't know where they're gonna go I don't know where anybody's gonna go
[02:04:12.020 --> 02:04:15.220]  because I've looked at it I've looked at going to Central America and other
[02:04:15.220 --> 02:04:19.140]  countries well in their New World Order system it's like a spider tying up its
[02:04:19.140 --> 02:04:23.740]  its prey we are tied up in the red tape they're all exempt from it so that's
[02:04:23.740 --> 02:04:26.860]  why they only care about that global police power so they can rob nations
[02:04:26.860 --> 02:04:31.500]  one by one and kind of hopscotch around well but these guys that only have the
[02:04:31.500 --> 02:04:34.940]  multi-millions or maybe in the low billions they're just not big enough so
[02:04:34.940 --> 02:04:38.940]  they're gonna end up being the victim of the spider in the web as well at some
[02:04:38.940 --> 02:04:43.380]  point so they might as well join the fight and help fund what's going on here
[02:04:43.380 --> 02:04:47.220]  in the United States the United States is definitely worth saving and I'm not
[02:04:47.220 --> 02:04:51.700]  leaving anytime soon that's for sure now we've got to stand here we got to make
[02:04:51.700 --> 02:04:54.860]  our stand there's nowhere to run Richard Reeves always great having you in

[02:08:21.420 --> 02:08:29.300]  Alex Jones well the head of the only serious national organization that is
[02:08:29.300 --> 02:08:32.620]  no compromise on the Second Amendment Larry Pratt is where this is about 45
[02:08:32.620 --> 02:08:37.340]  after that I'll jam in some phone calls and get into some of our top stories but
[02:08:37.340 --> 02:08:41.300]  I want to talk about the Second Amendment situation with Larry Pratt from
[02:08:41.300 --> 02:08:46.940]  gunowners.org but first I wanted to throw this out there a headline suffer these
[02:08:46.940 --> 02:08:51.180]  criminals in Oakland don't call the cops and the police chief said give us more
[02:08:51.180 --> 02:08:54.740]  funding and we won't respond to burglary theft embezzlement grand theft
[02:08:54.740 --> 02:09:01.580]  grand theft auto extortion embezzlement by an employee poisoning
[02:09:01.580 --> 02:09:08.500]  administering poison to someone vandalism and it's also says sabotaging
[02:09:08.500 --> 02:09:13.220]  power lines I mean I don't know if this is an alternate dimension or something
[02:09:13.220 --> 02:09:17.980]  but that dovetails with a WKYC report and others we've been talking about we're
[02:09:17.980 --> 02:09:24.140]  112 deputies to 49 deputies in this Ohio County but that deputy that sheriff
[02:09:24.140 --> 02:09:28.540]  and judge they're saying buy guns we can't protect you and the 49 cops
[02:09:28.540 --> 02:09:32.100]  they're gonna keep one will be out there helping with calls the rest of all
[02:09:32.100 --> 02:09:36.420]  bureaucracy and revenue generation but out in Oakland they're increasing
[02:09:36.420 --> 02:09:41.900]  anti-gun funding wanting thumbprints to get ammo it's just totally insane but
[02:09:41.900 --> 02:09:45.580]  then we see Obama telling Senator Kyle a month ago in a meeting and this is on
[02:09:45.580 --> 02:09:49.340]  record that Senator Kyle spoken about it that I'm gonna keep the borders open
[02:09:49.340 --> 02:09:53.140]  for a crisis as the SPP documents say to get amnesty so this is an act of
[02:09:53.140 --> 02:10:00.700]  treason I had Arizona sheriff on Babu and he said it does he said I'm in the
[02:10:00.700 --> 02:10:04.900]  military I can't really say it but it is does borderline treason to openly
[02:10:04.900 --> 02:10:09.980]  bring down your country Obama's blocking the oil spill relief the Supreme
[02:10:09.980 --> 02:10:12.820]  Court has ruled yes you can have a gun if you jump through a hundred hoops
[02:10:12.820 --> 02:10:17.780]  Chicago's saying 500 bucks five hours testing psychological testing can't
[02:10:17.780 --> 02:10:21.380]  have the gun outside your house so I see this is the Supreme Court ruling you
[02:10:21.380 --> 02:10:24.660]  you've got a right to basically turn your guns in but some say it has you know
[02:10:24.660 --> 02:10:28.020]  at least some effect because it says you can't outright ban them all so we'll
[02:10:28.020 --> 02:10:32.380]  talk about all that with Larry Pratt but now we have seeing an insane central
[02:10:32.380 --> 02:10:35.980]  banks start to abandon US dollar New York Times saying what we're in a mega
[02:10:35.980 --> 02:10:39.940]  depression and so now they're not lying about that but their answer is more
[02:10:39.940 --> 02:10:44.500]  government and then I have the Financial Times of London top Clinton
[02:10:44.500 --> 02:10:50.220]  official only a terror attack and save Obama that's what former top Clinton
[02:10:50.220 --> 02:10:54.940]  advisor and Obama advisor Robert Shapiro said the bottom line is that
[02:10:54.940 --> 02:10:59.100]  Americans don't believe in their president Obama's leadership quote he
[02:10:59.100 --> 02:11:03.500]  has to find some way between now and November of demonstrating that he is a
[02:11:03.500 --> 02:11:07.860]  leader who can command confidence and short of a 9-11 event and short of a
[02:11:07.860 --> 02:11:12.820]  9-11 event or an Oklahoma City bombing I think I can't think of how he can do
[02:11:12.820 --> 02:11:18.900]  that amazing statement so we're all in grave danger ladies and gentlemen right
[02:11:18.900 --> 02:11:21.700]  now Larry Pratt good to have you with us and it could be with you thanks for
[02:11:21.700 --> 02:11:26.180]  having me let's take it piece by piece what is your view on all over the
[02:11:26.180 --> 02:11:32.340]  country police saying all the money has to go to bankers or bankrupt and we're
[02:11:32.340 --> 02:11:35.060]  not going to protect you anymore but you can't have a gun to protect yourself
[02:11:35.060 --> 02:11:39.020]  well there's the rub it's that can't have a gun anyway even though we're not
[02:11:39.020 --> 02:11:44.500]  gonna do our job and what it should be is a wake-up call for all of us that we
[02:11:44.500 --> 02:11:49.100]  can't depend on the police even if they're doing everything they possibly
[02:11:49.100 --> 02:11:56.140]  can and want to do they're just not going to be enough of them ever to have a
[02:11:56.140 --> 02:12:01.660]  cop on your shoulder you know the bumper sticker says I carry a gun because a
[02:12:01.660 --> 02:12:06.260]  cop is too heavy and that's I think what comes out of all this and we've got a
[02:12:06.260 --> 02:12:12.820]  pushback on our employees who have the incredible view that they can tell us we
[02:12:12.820 --> 02:12:17.580]  can't have a gun to protect ourselves and tell them that either they get it
[02:12:17.580 --> 02:12:23.900]  figured out right or we're gonna get somebody else in there but I mean what
[02:12:23.900 --> 02:12:28.220]  about the message that we're not gonna respond to burglary home invasions we're
[02:12:28.220 --> 02:12:31.700]  not gonna respond to people being poisoned when someone poisons them we're
[02:12:31.700 --> 02:12:35.740]  not gonna respond to extortion we're not gonna respond to sabotage I mean this
[02:12:35.740 --> 02:12:40.780]  is a green light to go absolutely ape in Oakland Cal Oakland California well
[02:12:40.780 --> 02:12:46.620]  you know even in an anti-gun jurisdiction such as Chicago it kind of
[02:12:46.620 --> 02:12:50.500]  surprised me but the state several years ago in fact Obama voted on the wrong
[02:12:50.500 --> 02:12:55.900]  side of the measure the state has a law that preempts what cities can do when
[02:12:55.900 --> 02:13:00.620]  someone uses a quote-unquote illegal gun meaning it wasn't licensed but of
[02:13:00.620 --> 02:13:03.820]  course you couldn't get a license for it anyway and they use it in self-defense
[02:13:03.820 --> 02:13:10.580]  during a home invasion they the cities are prohibited from taking such an
[02:13:10.580 --> 02:13:17.300]  individual to court and three times in the last a couple of months individuals
[02:13:17.300 --> 02:13:22.260]  have used handguns for self-defense she at least one case I know they shot and
[02:13:22.260 --> 02:13:28.380]  killed the invader nothing could be done by the city as bad as as daily wanted
[02:13:28.380 --> 02:13:33.660]  to bring charges couldn't do it and so that's one way to legislatively handle
[02:13:33.660 --> 02:13:38.460]  the problem is just make it so that you can't touch us if we have done
[02:13:38.460 --> 02:13:42.460]  something in self-defense and of course the better laws are those in Florida and
[02:13:42.460 --> 02:13:46.780]  Texas and some other states the so-called castle doctrine where your
[02:13:46.780 --> 02:13:51.460]  home is your castle and they've taken the castle to mean anywhere you are so if
[02:13:51.460 --> 02:13:55.780]  you're out in a parking lot and some thug is trying to rape you and you pull
[02:13:55.780 --> 02:14:01.420]  out a piece and blow him away well that was just his bad luck and it shows the
[02:14:01.420 --> 02:14:05.940]  mindset though of what we'd call liberal or communist jurisdictions did you see
[02:14:05.940 --> 02:14:10.220]  the case last week I know you've been on a town where the 82 year old vet the guy
[02:14:10.220 --> 02:14:13.980]  was robbing him taking his trailer trying to run over him to illegal aliens
[02:14:13.980 --> 02:14:17.860]  so he shot one of them just wounding him and then they let the illegals go
[02:14:17.860 --> 02:14:21.580]  know they plug guilty to stealing it and they charged him with murder not man
[02:14:21.580 --> 02:14:26.940]  slaughter the old man with with murder and life in prison because he defended
[02:14:26.940 --> 02:14:31.340]  himself that sounds like something out of London yes it does and I know that
[02:14:31.340 --> 02:14:36.260]  there's that a temptation for some prosecutors even in a state like Texas
[02:14:36.260 --> 02:14:40.700]  where a situation a couple of years ago the facts were a little different but
[02:14:40.700 --> 02:14:46.220]  the thugs were running across from his neighbor's house across his property and
[02:14:46.220 --> 02:14:51.700]  he blew him away and all they spent six months trying to figure out if they
[02:14:51.700 --> 02:14:56.940]  could get a bill from a grand jury on that and they finally dropped the charges
[02:14:56.940 --> 02:15:04.100]  because the Texas law is so clear that you can use lethal force if you have
[02:15:04.100 --> 02:15:07.540]  any reason to think your life is in danger when you got a couple of thugs
[02:15:07.540 --> 02:15:13.660]  seeing you there with a shotgun cutting across your property and a cop
[02:15:13.660 --> 02:15:18.500]  actually happened to see it and said yeah that's what happened then you know
[02:15:18.500 --> 02:15:22.140]  that that's the way it ought to be and we'd reduce the criminal population a
[02:15:22.140 --> 02:15:27.500]  lot more quickly that way than having to endure years and years of appeals and
[02:15:27.500 --> 02:15:33.340]  trials and great cost and injustice frankly justice delayed as justice
[02:15:33.340 --> 02:15:37.540]  denied well Larry we know in Chicago in New York City they have the highest
[02:15:37.540 --> 02:15:41.260]  crime rates the criminals all move there it's a war zone every day we know that
[02:15:41.260 --> 02:15:44.980]  common sense but we know the globalist we know cerebrates on record saying we
[02:15:44.980 --> 02:15:48.060]  can't have a socialist America we disarmed the American people we know
[02:15:48.060 --> 02:15:51.900]  for unity or at the UN they say the power monopoly of the state everyone
[02:15:51.900 --> 02:15:55.780]  must be disarmed state senator Obama believed in total gun bans the attorney
[02:15:55.780 --> 02:16:00.620]  general believes in it we know that that they want our guns to enslave us but
[02:16:00.620 --> 02:16:04.580]  the average moron who's scared of guns who's domesticated who was brought up
[02:16:04.580 --> 02:16:09.140]  by domesticated gelded people they're not really bad they're just ignorant and
[02:16:09.140 --> 02:16:12.980]  it's just like people who wouldn't let folks hunt wolves or coyotes or wildcats
[02:16:12.980 --> 02:16:17.220]  or alligators in you know places like major cities in Florida now they're
[02:16:17.220 --> 02:16:21.180]  killing people they're killing dogs they're coming into yards now even the
[02:16:21.180 --> 02:16:25.580]  socialists are saying yeah somebody kill these alligators somebody kill these
[02:16:25.580 --> 02:16:29.020]  wildcats they just killed my kid you know kids get killed every year because
[02:16:29.020 --> 02:16:33.580]  they like small prey in California and now wildcats are all over LA trying to
[02:16:33.580 --> 02:16:37.820]  eat people it's the same thing people they take the guns crime rates explode and
[02:16:37.820 --> 02:16:40.900]  I've seen all the statistics we're becoming a pro-gun nation again and
[02:16:40.900 --> 02:16:45.260]  rediscovering why it's so important that's got to make these social
[02:16:45.260 --> 02:16:50.660]  globalist these parasites angry that that neither way you cut it we are
[02:16:50.660 --> 02:16:55.780]  shifting the momentum against them you are correct the polls have been over
[02:16:55.780 --> 02:17:02.580]  the really the decades showing a trend in the direction of the understanding and
[02:17:02.580 --> 02:17:08.020]  wanting to apply the second amendment and this is something that is totally
[02:17:08.020 --> 02:17:12.780]  inconsistent with the socialist worldview they assume that they take charge
[02:17:12.780 --> 02:17:18.660]  of all at least important decisions in our lives and for them an important
[02:17:18.660 --> 02:17:24.300]  decision evidently is what kind of food we might be allowed to eat I don't have
[02:17:24.300 --> 02:17:28.980]  anything to say on behalf of junk food but if somebody wants to do that well
[02:17:28.980 --> 02:17:33.940]  less power to them is okay with me it's not my job to tell somebody what to eat
[02:17:33.940 --> 02:17:40.020]  so that's the mindset of these people they are control freaks and getting back
[02:17:40.020 --> 02:17:46.340]  to your earlier point they might as you say be upset about an extra wildcat in
[02:17:46.340 --> 02:17:50.780]  the neighborhood but they don't have a problem so much with criminals because
[02:17:50.780 --> 02:17:56.620]  criminals don't operate within their gated communities they'll be safe almost
[02:17:56.620 --> 02:18:01.820]  all the time from the criminal element and so it's an easy price for them to
[02:18:01.820 --> 02:18:06.740]  pay because they don't have to pay the price the elite in England hasn't had
[02:18:06.740 --> 02:18:11.500]  to pay the price of the rising crime rate following the the confiscation of
[02:18:11.500 --> 02:18:15.820]  virtually all the legal guns in the country and even though crime has
[02:18:15.820 --> 02:18:21.820]  multiplied literally multiplied the rich and famous don't ever get to see that
[02:18:21.820 --> 02:18:26.260]  it may be on television but it's never something that affects them directly so
[02:18:26.260 --> 02:18:31.180]  it's no big deal and they use our tax money to pay for government and private
[02:18:31.180 --> 02:18:36.860]  security Larry what about the realignment pro-establishment Republicans
[02:18:36.860 --> 02:18:40.900]  and Democrats are losing every major primary this is a major political
[02:18:40.900 --> 02:18:45.340]  realignment not in parties but for liberty the system is panicking Obama
[02:18:45.340 --> 02:18:49.940]  is in free fall and some of his top advisors are saying Obama needs another
[02:18:49.940 --> 02:18:54.740]  Oklahoma City or 9-11 that's pretty creepy to hear that what do you think
[02:18:54.740 --> 02:18:58.780]  Obama and his people are gonna do they're not gonna give up power easily it
[02:18:58.780 --> 02:19:03.980]  is a worrisome thought and columnists are beginning to speculate that something
[02:19:03.980 --> 02:19:08.540]  like that might be in store obviously he brought us a financial crisis thanks to
[02:19:08.540 --> 02:19:15.060]  years of incredibly stupid legislation making banks give loans to people they
[02:19:15.060 --> 02:19:20.980]  knew couldn't pay them back but it's pretty hard to get a financial crisis
[02:19:20.980 --> 02:19:26.220]  it's any worse than the one we're in so indeed the question would be what's
[02:19:26.220 --> 02:19:32.820]  next I think one thing we've seen a little foretaste is election thuggery
[02:19:32.820 --> 02:19:37.340]  particularly at the general election chasing away Republican voters with the
[02:19:37.340 --> 02:19:42.420]  new Black Panther Party well those are amazing tapes that are out there let's
[02:19:42.420 --> 02:19:47.700]  talk about Arizona when we get back and treason I mean Obama I don't know if
[02:19:47.700 --> 02:19:51.180]  you've seen the senator Kyle video we could play it or if you haven't but he
[02:19:51.180 --> 02:19:54.140]  you know he's saying he met with Obama Obama said I want the crisis down there
[02:19:54.140 --> 02:19:57.180]  I want to get amnesty passed I need that crisis I mean if that isn't an
[02:19:57.180 --> 02:20:03.020]  impeachable offense I don't know what is Lori Pratt's our guest stay with us

[02:24:08.140 --> 02:24:11.980]  Larry Pratt with us about other 15 minutes that I'm gonna open the phones up
[02:24:11.980 --> 02:24:18.580]  specifically on the headline top Clinton official only a terror attack and
[02:24:18.580 --> 02:24:23.340]  save Obama with the bizarre quote the bottom line here is that Americans
[02:24:23.340 --> 02:24:27.220]  don't believe in President Obama's leadership said Shapiro adding he has
[02:24:27.220 --> 02:24:31.660]  to find some way between now and November of demonstrating that he is a
[02:24:31.660 --> 02:24:35.940]  leader who can command confidence and short of a 9-11 event or Oklahoma City
[02:24:35.940 --> 02:24:40.300]  bombing I can't think of how he could do that Larry I know I brought this up to
[02:24:40.300 --> 02:24:43.060]  you but I really want to get your take on it specifically that's out of the
[02:24:43.060 --> 02:24:48.260]  financial times of London and the media is everywhere saying he's in free fall
[02:24:48.260 --> 02:24:55.300]  whereas he has 40% supporting him only 13% total have confidence I mean this
[02:24:55.300 --> 02:24:58.580]  guy looks like he may be the most unpopular president in history he's
[02:24:58.580 --> 02:25:03.980]  working on it I think he may get there and I don't think he's incompetent my
[02:25:03.980 --> 02:25:08.220]  take on this guy and you and I have talked about it from even before he was
[02:25:08.220 --> 02:25:13.860]  elected and I know I published a column before he was elected pointing out that
[02:25:13.860 --> 02:25:20.420]  he was a Marxist thug well he true to Saul Alinsky the rules for radicals
[02:25:20.420 --> 02:25:26.500]  author who explained how to tear down a system and have it explode on itself by
[02:25:26.500 --> 02:25:31.140]  just overloading it with too much welfare voter fraud all kinds of
[02:25:31.140 --> 02:25:37.140]  financial crisis you name it the guys working very hard to destroy and he's
[02:25:37.140 --> 02:25:41.660]  working very fast at it he's done that I mean if you're gonna build the new
[02:25:41.660 --> 02:25:45.340]  socialist utopia you've got to destroy the old house that was there they want
[02:25:45.340 --> 02:25:50.340]  to destroy this country absolutely and there's just no question that that's not
[02:25:50.340 --> 02:25:54.900]  in confidence down in the Gulf of Mexico that is a desire to get all those
[02:25:54.900 --> 02:25:59.940]  blankety-blank Republican voters payback time baby now we'll teach you that you
[02:25:59.940 --> 02:26:03.820]  should be dependent rather than independent rather than producers you
[02:26:03.820 --> 02:26:09.580]  should be drones so that we can control you I agree with you BP is the top
[02:26:09.580 --> 02:26:14.620]  globalist company that with Al Gore and in Ron created the carbon tax and Ron
[02:26:14.620 --> 02:26:17.820]  Paul agrees he thinks it's very suspicious and the way they're blocking
[02:26:17.820 --> 02:26:22.620]  any relief I think they stage the whole thing well if they didn't stage it it
[02:26:22.620 --> 02:26:27.060]  true that Rahm Emanuel you never let a good crisis go to waste but you know
[02:26:27.060 --> 02:26:33.180]  Obama himself is in a crisis and we should resolve not to let that crisis go
[02:26:33.180 --> 02:26:37.220]  to waste we should take care of business as we have been you you mentioned
[02:26:37.220 --> 02:26:41.380]  before we went to the break that at least most of the primaries have been
[02:26:41.380 --> 02:26:45.380]  going as we would hope they would sometimes we have too many conservatives
[02:26:45.380 --> 02:26:49.460]  dividing the vote and a liberal gets through like Dan Coates in Indiana but
[02:26:49.460 --> 02:26:56.300]  by and large the results have really been very satisfactory and if especially
[02:26:56.300 --> 02:26:59.860]  somebody like Jim DeMint is able to continue doing what he's doing the
[02:26:59.860 --> 02:27:05.060]  Republican caucus in the Senate will have shifted to the right enough to tell
[02:27:05.060 --> 02:27:09.500]  senator McConnell to stop playing patty cakes with the Democrats I don't know
[02:27:09.500 --> 02:27:13.460]  but it's certainly going to be more difficult for senator McConnell because
[02:27:13.460 --> 02:27:18.980]  some of the people that are coming owe him nothing let's shift gears to Arizona
[02:27:18.980 --> 02:27:23.140]  many have called it treason I think it fits the definition of high treason not
[02:27:23.140 --> 02:27:27.140]  just treason we now have that senator Kyle testimony that he was told they
[02:27:27.140 --> 02:27:30.980]  will they love the crisis the kidnappings the murder of the death 80
[02:27:30.980 --> 02:27:36.500]  plus miles denied to citizens into the state and that they are gonna sue they're
[02:27:36.500 --> 02:27:40.220]  gonna file multiple lawsuits against Arizona but all these other states are
[02:27:40.220 --> 02:27:44.220]  gonna do the same thing Arizona's done the Democrats are now in the Wall Street
[02:27:44.220 --> 02:27:49.580]  Journal begging Obama to back off they say this is unified the population really
[02:27:49.580 --> 02:27:53.340]  illustrated that these people want to destroy this country maybe they don't
[02:27:53.340 --> 02:27:58.580]  remember the intensity and they're almost literally the green smoke coming up
[02:27:58.580 --> 02:28:04.060]  from the Capitol Hill switchboards during the amnesty fight that really got
[02:28:04.060 --> 02:28:09.140]  the country angry and there was there were groups out there encouraging people
[02:28:09.140 --> 02:28:14.060]  to make calls but there was also just a lot of spontaneous effort because people
[02:28:14.060 --> 02:28:19.100]  couldn't believe that we're going to allow not only to continue such law
[02:28:19.100 --> 02:28:25.460]  breaking as just walk into our country la di da and then this have no regard for
[02:28:25.460 --> 02:28:30.300]  the danger it puts people in the rancher just a what two three months of four
[02:28:30.300 --> 02:28:34.700]  months ago that was murdered on his own land down on the border and this was a
[02:28:34.700 --> 02:28:42.660]  guy known to have helped illegals that were in danger of dying of thirst and
[02:28:42.660 --> 02:28:46.740]  yet no good deed goes unpunished and that doesn't seem to bother Obama
[02:28:46.740 --> 02:28:49.500]  because again he lives in a gated community it's called the White House
[02:28:49.500 --> 02:28:54.940]  and you can't get close to him for anything so he's no problem there what
[02:28:54.940 --> 02:28:58.460]  what border problem we know they've been in a race they know Mexico the State
[02:28:58.460 --> 02:29:01.900]  Department has been collapsing for four years it's now officially a failed
[02:29:01.900 --> 02:29:06.580]  state they had to merge us with Mexico in the SPP before it collapsed now
[02:29:06.580 --> 02:29:10.060]  they're behind schedule and they're saying get rid of the border legalize
[02:29:10.060 --> 02:29:14.860]  everybody as Mexico collapses well the audacity of saying well we'll build the
[02:29:14.860 --> 02:29:18.940]  wall as soon as you agree to amnesty well isn't that kind of like closing the
[02:29:18.940 --> 02:29:25.060]  door after the barns the barn door after the horse got out please well that's
[02:29:25.060 --> 02:29:29.140]  like plugging a hole in the bottom of a ship after it's on the bottom yeah
[02:29:29.140 --> 02:29:33.740]  exactly right they think we're that stupid I well we'll see Larry I want to

[02:30:04.420 --> 02:30:08.860]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[02:30:08.860 --> 02:30:12.900]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[02:30:12.900 --> 02:30:16.820]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[02:30:16.820 --> 02:30:20.820]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:30:20.820 --> 02:30:25.380]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:30:25.380 --> 02:30:29.420]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:30:29.420 --> 02:30:33.220]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:30:33.220 --> 02:30:36.820]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[02:30:36.820 --> 02:30:41.180]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[02:34:04.940 --> 02:34:08.900]  the globalists are so well entrenched people better intensify their actions
[02:34:08.900 --> 02:34:12.700]  I want to get your view on that and give us just a quick state of the Second
[02:34:12.700 --> 02:34:18.620]  Amendment here in the Republic and some of the battles we're fighting okay well
[02:34:18.620 --> 02:34:26.700]  the first one is Elena Kagan it is not the most likely battled that we might
[02:34:26.700 --> 02:34:33.540]  win but we have a chance to beat her it is possible that we either can get
[02:34:33.540 --> 02:34:38.140]  enough backbone in the Republicans to launch a filibuster they would have the
[02:34:38.140 --> 02:34:42.860]  votes to kill it right there but it's also possible this woman has committed
[02:34:42.860 --> 02:34:48.940]  perjury on two occasions when she was testifying under oath she said she would
[02:34:48.940 --> 02:34:53.460]  proceed according to a certain course of action and she absolutely reversed course
[02:34:53.460 --> 02:34:58.220]  once she was in I hope folks would go to gun owners org we've got alerts there
[02:34:58.220 --> 02:35:03.260]  that deal with this telling the senators you better not even go for this gal
[02:35:03.260 --> 02:35:07.780]  she's an enemy of freedom and we're gonna be hitting them hopefully a very
[02:35:07.780 --> 02:35:12.980]  soon with some information on her the the actual lies that we've caught her in
[02:35:12.980 --> 02:35:17.220]  and I think on two occasions we can actually make the case that she committed
[02:35:17.220 --> 02:35:21.860]  their voting for confirmation next week on the 20th I guess that's that's what
[02:35:21.860 --> 02:35:25.780]  it's scheduled yes that's Tuesday so and I know you've done the research but can
[02:35:25.780 --> 02:35:31.380]  you give us a little idea of what the particular perjury is one just give you
[02:35:31.380 --> 02:35:36.260]  one for example she was testifying when under oath when she was up for
[02:35:36.260 --> 02:35:40.220]  solicitor general her present job she was asked if she were going to pursue
[02:35:40.220 --> 02:35:44.740]  anything against the DOMA Defense of Marriage Act and she said no I'm not
[02:35:44.740 --> 02:35:48.500]  interested in going there almost the first thing she did when she got in was
[02:35:48.500 --> 02:35:53.220]  to turn around and start whacking away in the courts on that issue so it seems
[02:35:53.220 --> 02:36:00.620]  to me that she's got herself in pretty deep and she didn't subject herself
[02:36:00.620 --> 02:36:06.220]  well to the light of day so I'm hopeful that we're going to push back hard
[02:36:06.220 --> 02:36:10.860]  enough that some of these guys are gonna maybe this is going to be Obama's
[02:36:10.860 --> 02:36:16.180]  Harriet Myers the hapless nominee that Bush put forward that was finally
[02:36:16.180 --> 02:36:22.300]  slapped down another thing that's going in and could be very encouraging for
[02:36:22.300 --> 02:36:26.300]  the elections and it would re-energize discussion of socialized medicine which
[02:36:26.300 --> 02:36:30.300]  the Republicans have not apparently wanted to do and that's that's not a
[02:36:30.300 --> 02:36:36.660]  good thing there's a discharge petition on representative Steve King's measure
[02:36:36.660 --> 02:36:42.140]  that would just flat out repeal Obamacare now it's not likely and Obama's
[02:36:42.140 --> 02:36:46.420]  going to sign it but we need to get the members of Congress on record and
[02:36:46.420 --> 02:36:51.580]  whether they even get to a vote the fact is that while we work to the majority
[02:36:51.580 --> 02:36:57.260]  that must sign to force the vote that signing list itself will be like a
[02:36:57.260 --> 02:37:01.820]  recorded vote and one more thing that we can hold over them you mean after all
[02:37:01.820 --> 02:37:05.940]  the things that came out after the passage of the bill about what a corrupt
[02:37:05.940 --> 02:37:10.580]  and rotten piece of socialism it is you still wouldn't vote against it so I
[02:37:10.580 --> 02:37:16.900]  think that's a pretty powerful issue and secondly I hope people will kind of
[02:37:16.900 --> 02:37:22.460]  keep an eye on our colleagues at the NRA redstate.com a very widely read
[02:37:22.460 --> 02:37:29.660]  blog yesterday had a column by Eric Erickson on how the NRA actually tried
[02:37:29.660 --> 02:37:35.260]  to stop Senator Coburn's measure from succeeding happily he withstood their
[02:37:35.260 --> 02:37:42.180]  efforts and it is now law that the Reagan era gun ban of guns in national
[02:37:42.180 --> 02:37:47.220]  parks has been overturned but they didn't want it to go forward. Well what about the
[02:37:47.220 --> 02:37:51.580]  Wall Street Journal a month ago ran the headline that the NRA cited with the
[02:37:51.580 --> 02:37:56.220]  House that's passed the bill to restrict political speech about how
[02:37:56.220 --> 02:38:01.580]  congressmen have voted. That had people's jaw dropping here in Washington and
[02:38:01.580 --> 02:38:06.100]  they're still taking heat for it and actually we may bottle that up in the
[02:38:06.100 --> 02:38:09.780]  Senate that's another thing folks can go to gunowners.org for we've got a
[02:38:09.780 --> 02:38:13.780]  another alert that deals with that. I forget the name of that bill what's it
[02:38:13.780 --> 02:38:19.140]  called? Disclose it's an acronym for something about the light of day on
[02:38:19.140 --> 02:38:25.180]  disclosure in politics. It's just a way of harassing members of organizations of
[02:38:25.180 --> 02:38:30.060]  attempt to get the names. The Federal Elections Commission had Ron Paul on a
[02:38:30.060 --> 02:38:33.460]  week and a half ago they're now investigating campaign for liberty with
[02:38:33.460 --> 02:38:38.300]  a fine-tooth comb telling them you're not allowed to send out emails on how
[02:38:38.300 --> 02:38:43.460]  people voted. I mean that's incredible we can't say how somebody voted. What
[02:38:43.460 --> 02:38:48.900]  they're mad because he had a way of starting up an organization from his
[02:38:48.900 --> 02:38:54.980]  presidential drive and campaign for liberty is going great guns and that
[02:38:54.980 --> 02:38:58.740]  has them very upset. It's a new kid on the block and I guess they'd like to
[02:38:58.740 --> 02:39:02.740]  strangle it in its crib but that ain't gonna happen. Well as you know it's a key
[02:39:02.740 --> 02:39:08.180]  catalyst to get more patriot you know pro-constitution candidates in when
[02:39:08.180 --> 02:39:12.340]  every time they run they win if they've got backing. Absolutely it's been a very
[02:39:12.340 --> 02:39:17.860]  successful year for that segment of the political spectrum. They've been doing an
[02:39:17.860 --> 02:39:22.940]  excellent job. The Tea Party is reflective of that work as well and
[02:39:22.940 --> 02:39:26.820]  it's brought in additional people and the fact that there are lots of new
[02:39:26.820 --> 02:39:32.860]  people involved tells you something. When in a very liberal district out in
[02:39:32.860 --> 02:39:38.780]  California, Representative Harman, Brad Sherman, when the people at a town hall
[02:39:38.780 --> 02:39:44.740]  meeting erupted in disbelief and catcalls when he said he wasn't aware of
[02:39:44.740 --> 02:39:49.580]  the thuggery of the New Black Panther Party during the elections up in
[02:39:49.580 --> 02:39:55.540]  Philadelphia in 2008, the people just shut the meeting down and the guy said
[02:39:55.540 --> 02:39:59.460]  well I didn't see anything about it in the media that I read. Well that's just
[02:39:59.460 --> 02:40:04.220]  the problem pal. You're in your own dream world and the rest of us aren't in
[02:40:04.220 --> 02:40:09.340]  that socialist cocoon. Well that's right less and less people watch it CNN, MSNBC
[02:40:09.340 --> 02:40:14.380]  or in Freefall and I'm not exaggerating I'm not one of the you know even top
[02:40:14.380 --> 02:40:19.380]  well some ways you look at number one internet show top 15 conservatively a
[02:40:19.380 --> 02:40:24.380]  talk radio but still that's not that you know big for being on stations but the
[02:40:24.380 --> 02:40:28.700]  issue is I can look at our affiliated stations and just the stations that
[02:40:28.700 --> 02:40:33.340]  subscribe to Arbitron and our numbers. I have more listeners and viewers
[02:40:33.340 --> 02:40:38.940]  conservatively in my three hours than CNN's top-rated show. There's still the
[02:40:38.940 --> 02:40:43.940]  prestige of Larry King having a million viewers but I mean I have close to
[02:40:43.940 --> 02:40:49.540]  300,000 podcast listeners a day. Our affiliates now have over 400,000 listeners
[02:40:49.540 --> 02:40:54.700]  for every 15 minutes that's the big you know CUME number that the ad agencies
[02:40:54.700 --> 02:40:59.620]  have and I mean I mean if I've got over a million people every day more than two
[02:40:59.620 --> 02:41:02.300]  million total a week because you know you have regulars that come in but the
[02:41:02.300 --> 02:41:05.740]  stragglers it's about two million a week and growing I mean Larry King Live is a
[02:41:05.740 --> 02:41:10.020]  joke I mean that's why he's retiring I mean it's over for these people no one
[02:41:10.020 --> 02:41:14.740]  is listening to them. Correct. Their numbers are in freefall. Every time I
[02:41:14.740 --> 02:41:19.260]  see something about that it's clear that people are either not getting any
[02:41:19.260 --> 02:41:23.100]  information at all but more likely they're going to all of these alternate
[02:41:23.100 --> 02:41:26.940]  sources that are available. I don't get a daily paper delivered to my house
[02:41:26.940 --> 02:41:33.740]  anymore why should I? You have so many ways of getting information and the
[02:41:33.740 --> 02:41:36.900]  information that I'm looking for wouldn't have been in the daily. Well that brings me
[02:41:36.900 --> 02:41:40.340]  to my next to last question. Here are the two questions quickly because I know
[02:41:40.340 --> 02:41:45.780]  you're busy. Number one, Chicago. How do you analyze that ruling and the hoops
[02:41:45.780 --> 02:41:48.540]  that Chicago wants people to jump through? Do you think that'll be
[02:41:48.540 --> 02:41:52.860]  challenged? You know a quick statement on that sir and then finally they're openly
[02:41:52.860 --> 02:41:56.380]  announcing they want to censor the web and talk radio now that's just proving
[02:41:56.380 --> 02:41:59.900]  to people what thugs they are. Exactly. Well I think in case of Chicago
[02:41:59.900 --> 02:42:03.380]  they're going to get away with this until they are challenged and there's the
[02:42:03.380 --> 02:42:08.900]  possibility that if the second heller case which is now before the DC court of
[02:42:08.900 --> 02:42:14.780]  appeals is successful and if it's lawyered in the proper way so that it's
[02:42:14.780 --> 02:42:20.420]  a broad enough suit and a broad enough decision it would not only bring down the
[02:42:20.420 --> 02:42:26.100]  DC licensing law which I think is quite likely based on what Judge Scalia said
[02:42:26.100 --> 02:42:31.820]  in the first heller decision but it could then if it's a broad enough instead
[02:42:31.820 --> 02:42:36.420]  of just a narrow thing like these first two heller and McDonald decisions have
[02:42:36.420 --> 02:42:41.900]  been it could bring down Chicago as well. I'm sorry the second point that you
[02:42:41.900 --> 02:42:46.980]  wanted to address. No just finally the open announcements that they want to tax
[02:42:46.980 --> 02:42:52.220]  and control the internet. I think that you're correct that has shown people that
[02:42:52.220 --> 02:42:55.940]  if they can't win the argument they're going to try to put a gag in her mouth
[02:42:55.940 --> 02:43:00.460]  that's what McCain Feingold was all about that's what the Disclose Act is all
[02:43:00.460 --> 02:43:04.300]  about and if they can come up with this and they're already starting in a few
[02:43:04.300 --> 02:43:08.900]  markets to set up these Soviets they call them stakeholder councils but the
[02:43:08.900 --> 02:43:16.460]  word council is Soviet in Russian and the these Soviets would be designed to
[02:43:16.460 --> 02:43:22.540]  file a liberal complaint against any station that's carrying your show or
[02:43:22.540 --> 02:43:29.220]  any of the other talkers and make it so that they have so much in a file at the
[02:43:29.220 --> 02:43:33.580]  time for renewal that they might not get their renewals so stations knowing
[02:43:33.580 --> 02:43:38.220]  that would then start figuring out well what kind of pablum can I offset so I
[02:43:38.220 --> 02:43:41.980]  don't have the expense of fighting these five instead of stations buckling to
[02:43:41.980 --> 02:43:45.180]  that they need to get more aggressive and defend the First Amendment you cannot
[02:43:45.180 --> 02:43:50.580]  pacify these hooligans I mean this is real authoritarianism these people aren't
[02:43:50.580 --> 02:43:55.860]  playing games correct that is exactly the right thing to do we we need to make
[02:43:55.860 --> 02:44:01.620]  sure that if they want to do thuggery at the polls it'll be dealt with in a
[02:44:01.620 --> 02:44:05.860]  proper fashion we got to be organized for that and it goes back to the point
[02:44:05.860 --> 02:44:09.740]  you made earlier we've got to double down and intensify our efforts and we've
[02:44:09.740 --> 02:44:15.060]  all got to get involved as poll watchers and people that are right there on the
[02:44:15.060 --> 02:44:19.580]  scene so when stuff starts to happen you know in Chicago the Republican poll
[02:44:19.580 --> 02:44:22.860]  watchers usually a Democrat anyway so he's not going to pick up a cell phone
[02:44:22.860 --> 02:44:28.380]  and call the cops we've got to be there to do those kinds of things absolutely
[02:44:28.380 --> 02:44:31.420]  and instead of having one video of people intimidating voters will have
[02:44:31.420 --> 02:44:34.700]  hundreds as we know it's going on Larry Pratt thank you so much for spending
[02:44:34.700 --> 02:44:38.100]  time with us been great to be with you thanks for having me always wonderful

[02:44:49.060 --> 02:44:53.100]  engineered collapse of the country and the fact that the police are saying
[02:44:53.100 --> 02:44:56.500]  we're not going to protect you that's going up on info wars dot com and
[02:44:56.500 --> 02:45:00.580]  prisonplanet.com within two hours we need this video to go mega viral so
[02:45:00.580 --> 02:45:04.980]  people understand the economic implosion is by design I'm asking you for your help
[02:45:04.980 --> 02:45:09.380]  on that and the story by Paul Watson top Clinton official only a terror attack
[02:45:09.380 --> 02:45:13.940]  and save Obama he's writing another article right now that's gonna go along
[02:45:13.940 --> 02:45:18.380]  with Aaron Dyches a video that we're editing we shot it last night and working
[02:45:18.380 --> 02:45:21.980]  on it this morning that's going out because people need to put the pieces
[02:45:21.980 --> 02:45:25.100]  together they know something's wrong they don't know specifically what it is we
[02:45:25.100 --> 02:45:30.940]  do I mean the battle's on and coming up in the next hour I'm gonna detail all
[02:45:30.940 --> 02:45:34.700]  of this with key information most important information I've ever covered
[02:45:34.700 --> 02:45:39.500]  here on air let's go ahead and talk to Matt in New York Matt thanks for
[02:45:39.500 --> 02:45:43.820]  holding Alex Matt for mobilize the people in New York by the way we just
[02:45:43.820 --> 02:45:48.620]  added videos of your broadcast on mobilize the people dot com to get the message out
[02:45:48.620 --> 02:45:52.100]  absolutely correct in your assessment of the trees and its behavior by the
[02:45:52.100 --> 02:45:55.580]  president and other officials the bottom line is they need to be held accountable
[02:45:55.580 --> 02:45:59.380]  by the people which speaks a larger point you had earlier of accelerating the
[02:45:59.380 --> 02:46:04.500]  freedom freedom movement we need to be able to reach new people the future of
[02:46:04.500 --> 02:46:06.900]  this movement the freedom movement depends upon the need to change the
[02:46:06.900 --> 02:46:10.940]  language of the debate and a way we can communicate our message so we can reach
[02:46:10.940 --> 02:46:15.140]  these new people you know the idea of people having to get involved to
[02:46:15.140 --> 02:46:18.700]  promote and sustain freedom is new and scary it's a scary concept for a lot of
[02:46:18.700 --> 02:46:21.940]  people most people are just used to sitting on their butts and not doing
[02:46:21.940 --> 02:46:25.740]  anything and now you know the proposed with getting up and doing something and
[02:46:25.740 --> 02:46:30.260]  fighting for your belief in freedom is a scary concept which paralyzes a lot of
[02:46:30.260 --> 02:46:34.660]  people well here's an analogy if you went to Yellowstone Park now in the rural
[02:46:34.660 --> 02:46:39.620]  areas the uninhabited areas so the more remote areas where they've introduced
[02:46:39.620 --> 02:46:43.700]  hundreds of vicious timber wolves and you went out and poured pig blood all
[02:46:43.700 --> 02:46:47.580]  over yourself and tied yourself down they would come and eat you it's the
[02:46:47.580 --> 02:46:51.380]  same thing with tyrants if we just sit there watching our TV sets and suck on
[02:46:51.380 --> 02:46:55.100]  our thumbs and doing nothing and not being involved we will be overrun we
[02:46:55.100 --> 02:46:59.740]  will be oppressed there is no you know option here and I appreciate your call
[02:46:59.740 --> 02:47:06.140]  Matt Mary in Texas Mary you're on the air yes Alex I work with Richard Reeves
[02:47:06.140 --> 02:47:11.660]  on the toll road I want to I want to encourage everybody to go to turf
[02:47:11.660 --> 02:47:17.900]  Texas org because they are stealing from the pension funds we're trying to stop
[02:47:17.900 --> 02:47:22.380]  that in the legislature they need to go down the legislature and work on that
[02:47:22.380 --> 02:47:29.020]  and try to get that stop the toll roads are going to be used to finance the
[02:47:29.020 --> 02:47:35.140]  trans-Texas corridor the trans-Texas corridor is just a corridor that goes
[02:47:35.140 --> 02:47:41.260]  up from from China if you can imagine this from China to the deep water ports
[02:47:41.260 --> 02:47:47.340]  in Mexico up through the just a gut yes ma'am we Mary Mary Mary you notice I let
[02:47:47.340 --> 02:47:52.080]  Matt go really quick and and and now I'm talking to you because I open the
[02:47:52.080 --> 02:47:56.380]  phones up and I said what do you think I want to focus people on this and I did
[02:47:56.380 --> 02:47:59.340]  cover toll roads last hour I made a film in game blueprint for global enslavement
[02:47:59.340 --> 02:48:02.460]  that covers the Napa superhighways and the trans-Texas corridor and you're
[02:48:02.460 --> 02:48:06.740]  absolutely right and we did cover that last hour my what I wanted to hear from
[02:48:06.740 --> 02:48:10.740]  you on that's why we open the phones up is I want to hear from you about Obama's
[02:48:10.740 --> 02:48:14.340]  advisors saying they need a stage terror attack and the police saying they're not
[02:48:14.340 --> 02:48:17.540]  going to protect you they're going to let society totally collapse now Larry
[02:48:17.540 --> 02:48:21.980]  Pratt agreed that's the scenario and I want to hear from you Mary I want your
[02:48:21.980 --> 02:48:25.980]  perspective what do you think about those issues let me try to let me try to
[02:48:25.980 --> 02:48:31.020]  explain this to you these the big trans-Texas corridor is being built to
[02:48:31.020 --> 02:48:36.020]  carry big heavy army equipment what do you think of that and when they have the
[02:48:36.020 --> 02:48:40.860]  toll roads they're going to shut those roads down when they want well you know
[02:48:40.860 --> 02:48:44.740]  they built it Mary I know all about the toll roads yes I made a film about it
[02:48:44.740 --> 02:48:48.340]  it's called in game that's a large part of the three-hour film and yes I know
[02:48:48.340 --> 02:48:52.380]  they built the the highway system for the military the Eisenhower administration
[02:48:52.380 --> 02:48:56.980]  started it and and so they can land large jets on it and and yes we don't
[02:48:56.980 --> 02:49:00.300]  need a big road into Mexico Mary I guess when another day when we're on that
[02:49:00.300 --> 02:49:04.740]  subject that's fine Jason in California you care about the issues I raised
[02:49:04.740 --> 02:49:11.100]  hello Alex thanks for having me on yes sir go on so about a month ago I was on
[02:49:11.100 --> 02:49:16.420]  my way home I went out and had a drink with a friend of mine and I wasn't drunk
[02:49:16.420 --> 02:49:20.620]  or anything really I had just a couple beers and on my way home on the highway
[02:49:20.620 --> 02:49:24.900]  the 101 north up here in Northern California I was attacked by a hitchhiker
[02:49:24.900 --> 02:49:31.620]  and so I called 9-1-1 a hitchhiker I didn't stop he stepped in the
[02:49:31.620 --> 02:49:37.100]  path of the bike lane forcing me to veer into the mill I do that and so I
[02:49:37.100 --> 02:49:39.740]  called because in good conscience I couldn't pretty much just let this
[02:49:39.740 --> 02:49:43.740]  crazy guy just stand aside the freeway that's the message that's the message
[02:49:43.740 --> 02:49:47.020]  and that's the point I wanted to make today when you call the cops and fishing
[02:49:47.020 --> 02:49:50.460]  these corrupt cities they end up taking you to jail they don't want you calling
[02:49:50.460 --> 02:49:55.740]  them yeah that's exactly what happened I was pretty much are incarcerated
[02:49:55.740 --> 02:49:59.060]  temporarily five days deprived of freedom because they said I concealed
[02:49:59.060 --> 02:50:03.020]  weapon it was a sheath knife clearly hanging on my right side the officer
[02:50:03.020 --> 02:50:06.580]  pretty much turned around and I'm sure the crazy hitchhiker got scared away by
[02:50:06.580 --> 02:50:11.060]  the lights pretty much and so this little tyrant pretty much flipped out
[02:50:11.060 --> 02:50:15.900]  once you're on a bicycle you got a knife to protect yourself California is
[02:50:15.900 --> 02:50:19.380]  collapsing like Mexico it's going the exact same direction and you went to
[02:50:19.380 --> 02:50:22.540]  jail for having a knife and he claimed you couldn't drink a couple beers and
[02:50:22.540 --> 02:50:26.300]  ride your bicycle yeah he spins around behind me throws me up into a street sign
[02:50:26.300 --> 02:50:29.940]  and then puts me on the hood of his cruiser has his partner show up point
[02:50:29.940 --> 02:50:32.820]  to Taser in my head full-time calling him by their names and I'm like look
[02:50:32.820 --> 02:50:35.580]  what's going on what are you gonna do about the guy that attacked me why are
[02:50:35.580 --> 02:50:39.140]  you doing this they don't answer anything pretty much frantically restrict my
[02:50:39.140 --> 02:50:42.460]  belt off drag me off and hold me for like $25,000
[02:50:42.460 --> 02:50:46.860]  well you know what I'm not saying I'm what they did was wrong but a lot of
[02:50:46.860 --> 02:50:50.460]  times they get confused they hear there's a hitchhiker they probably thought
[02:50:50.460 --> 02:50:54.420]  you were the hitchhiker I appreciate your call that's terrible story folks only

[02:56:19.140 --> 02:56:23.980]  problem there's two or three in a year later there's 500 mm-hmm you see in
[02:56:23.980 --> 02:56:28.820]  Oceania in Georgia while you see rocket bombs coming into London every day to

[02:56:31.980 --> 02:56:36.060]  depend on the government and when Smith figures out the government's doing it
[02:56:36.060 --> 02:56:40.860]  exactly and you know it's the same thing here you know I not only not to

[02:57:14.420 --> 02:57:18.660]  to agitate you today that's not what I'm here for but it reminds me of what
[02:57:18.660 --> 02:57:24.060]  happened during Bush his ratings would fall they would stage something all we
[02:57:24.060 --> 02:57:26.900]  caught a terrorist here we caught a terrorist there then his ratings would
[02:57:26.900 --> 02:57:31.100]  go back up it was like a seesaw the whole entire time came out in his book
[02:57:31.100 --> 02:57:35.020]  last year that homeland security and said they were staging that and the terror
[02:57:35.020 --> 02:57:41.540]  alerts were fake what an incredible admission exactly and it is the sick
[02:57:41.540 --> 02:57:47.100]  thing is like you say they openly admit this garbage it's it's absolutely
[02:57:47.100 --> 02:57:52.940]  sick it's sadistic it's satanic it's evil I can't even describe it in in the
[02:57:52.940 --> 02:57:58.580]  true terms but Eric Holder even said that within terms of that policing that
[02:57:58.580 --> 02:58:03.660]  you were talking about in Oakland that they will not stop black people from
[02:58:03.660 --> 02:58:08.180]  attacking white people committing crimes well it's just total total implosion
[02:58:08.180 --> 02:58:13.060]  it's like this billboard saying national socialist communist socialist you know
[02:58:13.060 --> 02:58:18.020]  Marxist socials democrat socialist we know what this change is but Obama will
[02:58:18.020 --> 02:58:23.060]  go he won't be there soon but the tyranny will stay there we've got to
[02:58:23.060 --> 02:58:28.020]  start removing the tyranny not just the puppets and so everybody puts up a
[02:58:28.020 --> 02:58:32.420]  billboard starts a newsletter calls into talk radio the power of what you're
[02:58:32.420 --> 02:58:36.100]  doing is incredible and I couldn't do without my sponsors the affiliates the
[02:58:36.100 --> 02:58:40.060]  Genesis Network my crew everybody God bless you we couldn't do this without
