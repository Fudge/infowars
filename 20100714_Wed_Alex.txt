[00:00:03.578 --> 00:00:07.620]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.921]  You want answers?
[00:00:08.921 --> 00:00:10.982]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:10.982 --> 00:00:15.344]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:15.344 --> 00:00:20.987]  What do you mean I don't believe in God?
[00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:22.328]  Talk to him every day.
[00:00:22.328 --> 00:00:26.970]  What do you mean I don't support your system?
[00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.812]  I go to court when I have to.
[00:00:31.152 --> 00:00:34.033]  What do you mean I can't get to work on time?
[00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:36.854]  Got nothing better to do?
[00:00:36.854 --> 00:00:40.536]  What do you mean I don't pay my bills?
[00:00:40.536 --> 00:00:43.177]  What do you think I'm broke?
[00:00:43.177 --> 00:00:46.518]  Huh?
[00:00:46.518 --> 00:00:53.661]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live, worldwide, on this Wednesday, July 14, 2010 edition.
[00:00:58.285 --> 00:01:06.249]  This is the most important broadcast I have ever done in my 15 years of transmission.
[00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:18.855]  The most important broadcast I have ever done, except for maybe my 9-11-2001 transmission, when I laid it all on the line, when nobody else would, and told it like it was.
[00:01:21.172 --> 00:01:22.253]  You have epiphanies.
[00:01:22.253 --> 00:01:24.535]  You have basically brainstorms.
[00:01:24.535 --> 00:01:32.902]  Moments where you realize that you've been right about everything and the picture that was already clear becomes crystal clear.
[00:01:32.902 --> 00:01:34.323]  Crystal clear.
[00:01:34.323 --> 00:01:36.525]  I'm going to say this succinctly.
[00:01:36.525 --> 00:01:37.145]  There is a 100% chance
[00:01:41.055 --> 00:01:56.378]  That the United States will completely collapse into a road warrior like scenario if we do not address the problems now and point out that this is being engineered by design.
[00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:02.403]  Now, this road warrior collapse will only go on for a few years.
[00:02:02.403 --> 00:02:05.326]  It is being orchestrated to fully break the United States.
[00:02:05.326 --> 00:02:13.572]  This is an economic-slash-military coup d'etat, not just against the United States, but against the entire Western world.
[00:02:13.572 --> 00:02:24.481]  The globalists have already destroyed and leveled and annihilated and decimated the third world, and it's all been declassified that the IMF and World Bank brag in their internal memos that they have orchestrated it.
[00:02:25.282 --> 00:02:30.752]  They are doing the exact same thing here, but with a 21st century high-tech overlay.
[00:02:30.752 --> 00:02:36.824]  This is a mega 100% red alert, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:36.824 --> 00:02:37.845]  Red alert!
[00:02:38.902 --> 00:03:07.894]  We could go into the full collapse as early as next year, perhaps even sooner, but within the next two years, it is a 100% guaranteed fact that this society is completely collapsing by design and then what they have to offer after they've engineered the collapse and they've trained people to fully submit and accept a new way of life, living under the boot of the New World Order.
[00:03:09.136 --> 00:03:12.997]  It is so important what we are going to be covering today.
[00:03:12.997 --> 00:03:16.518]  Larry Pratt's joining us on the Second Amendment front for 30 minutes later.
[00:03:16.518 --> 00:03:23.580]  Richard Reeves for 30 minutes in studio dealing with the Napa Superhighways and the toll roads that they're putting in all over the nation.
[00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.441]  In the last few years, there's been massive resistance to it, so they played possum and claimed that they weren't going to do it.
[00:03:28.441 --> 00:03:29.622]  Now they're back with a vengeance.
[00:03:29.622 --> 00:03:33.423]  This is a key part of the globalist funding mechanism worldwide.
[00:03:33.423 --> 00:03:37.124]  We'll be exposing that coming up as well.
[00:03:37.978 --> 00:03:44.223]  So you'll definitely want to stay with us for Richard Reeves in the middle of the next hour, then Larry Pratt joining us at the beginning of the third hour.
[00:03:44.223 --> 00:03:49.008]  But I want to be extremely clear with everyone here today.
[00:03:49.008 --> 00:03:51.130]  Here are just some of the data points.
[00:03:52.318 --> 00:03:58.119]  When we come back from break, I'm going to break down and explain why I've come to this realization.
[00:03:58.119 --> 00:04:01.760]  Number one, the mainstream media is talking about total, complete collapse.
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.060]  Worse than the Great Depression everywhere.
[00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.321]  Of course, they've been engineering this.
[00:04:05.321 --> 00:04:08.641]  They hid that fact from you for the last few years, as we told you they would.
[00:04:08.641 --> 00:04:12.902]  But before they fully collapse our nation into the world government, that they would announce it.
[00:04:12.902 --> 00:04:14.162]  That is now happening.
[00:04:14.162 --> 00:04:15.823]  This is just the last day and a half.
[00:04:15.823 --> 00:04:17.563]  Central banks start to abandon the U.S.
[00:04:17.563 --> 00:04:18.423]  dollar.
[00:04:18.423 --> 00:04:20.744]  And who could blame them, is the quote.
[00:04:20.744 --> 00:04:20.904]  CNN.
[00:04:22.025 --> 00:04:27.496]  Uh, London Telegraph, Chinese rating agency strips Western nations of AAA status.
[00:04:27.496 --> 00:04:29.840]  Both parties mold raising retirement age.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:30.742]  Washington Times.
[00:04:32.301 --> 00:04:34.963]  Crisis awaits world banks as trillions come due.
[00:04:34.963 --> 00:04:35.764]  The big crash.
[00:04:35.764 --> 00:04:38.025]  America plunges into depression.
[00:04:38.025 --> 00:04:40.848]  This is all mainstream news in your face.
[00:04:40.848 --> 00:04:49.314]  That dovetails with all these police departments announcing that they're not going to stop people for assault, for poisoning, for robbery, for burglary.
[00:04:49.314 --> 00:04:55.018]  I'm going to explain what's happening and the most important information when we come back.
[00:04:55.018 --> 00:04:56.019]  Here's the headline.
[00:04:56.019 --> 00:04:57.060]  Top Clinton official.
[00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.141]  I'm getting chills.
[00:04:58.141 --> 00:05:00.723]  Only a terror attack can save Obama.
[00:05:00.723 --> 00:05:01.203]  Get ready.
[00:05:01.323 --> 00:05:05.886]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:05:05.886 --> 00:05:06.787]  Number 1.
[00:05:06.787 --> 00:05:10.210]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.070]  Number 2.
[00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.974]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:15.974 --> 00:05:16.714]  It's true.
[00:05:16.714 --> 00:05:21.578]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:21.578 --> 00:05:22.419]  Number 3.
[00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:26.001]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:05:26.001 --> 00:05:29.684]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:05:29.904 --> 00:05:30.705]  Number 4.
[00:05:30.705 --> 00:05:33.448]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:05:33.448 --> 00:05:37.152]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:05:37.152 --> 00:05:37.932]  Number 5.
[00:05:37.932 --> 00:05:42.077]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:05:42.077 --> 00:05:46.842]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:07:01.779 --> 00:07:02.720]  This is important.
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.821]  Alex Jones here.

[00:08:05.319 --> 00:08:15.006]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:15.006 --> 00:08:19.770]  Thank you for joining us on this July 14, 2010 Wednesday edition.
[00:08:21.516 --> 00:08:44.707]  You heard it here first, 100% probability that we will have a complete orchestrated collapse in the United States within the next 12 to 24 months, probably even sooner, that's conservative, if we do not realize the fight we're in, if we do not face the enemy that is coming down on us hardcore.
[00:08:44.707 --> 00:08:45.848]  I want to make something clear here.
[00:08:47.011 --> 00:08:48.932]  Barack Obama is a puppet.
[00:08:48.932 --> 00:08:51.473]  Barack Obama is a wicked scapegoat.
[00:08:51.473 --> 00:08:56.495]  Barack Obama is a Harvard CIA frontman lawyer.
[00:08:56.495 --> 00:09:03.138]  Barack Obama was designed for the implosion that you are now seeing.
[00:09:03.138 --> 00:09:04.019]  Understand that.
[00:09:04.847 --> 00:09:08.852]  The system knows there's a complete global realignment against tyranny.
[00:09:08.852 --> 00:09:12.055]  They know there's a worldwide awakening against the New World Order.
[00:09:12.055 --> 00:09:15.559]  Their own policy reports and Zbigniew Brzezinski admit that.
[00:09:15.559 --> 00:09:23.608]  And they are going to try to play the Tea Parties, the populist, the constitutional populist, off against the dumbed-down TV heads
[00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:33.854]  And basically distract us while they establish this world government that will be built out of the ashes of the worldwide depression that they've engineered.
[00:09:33.854 --> 00:09:36.316]  The end of the dollar is the world reserve currency.
[00:09:36.316 --> 00:09:37.716]  The end of our borders.
[00:09:37.716 --> 00:09:38.917]  The North American Union.
[00:09:38.917 --> 00:09:47.942]  It's all in the SPP, Security Prosperity Partnership documents that were released in 2007 via the four-year lawsuit by Judicial Watch.
[00:09:49.249 --> 00:09:53.732]  Now the data points are the media is now admitting we're going into a depression.
[00:09:53.732 --> 00:10:03.099]  All over the nation the announcements are being made that basic essential services from potholes to roads to police are just going to be shut off.
[00:10:03.099 --> 00:10:08.102]  This is the same thing that's been done in the third world over and over again via the IMF World Bank receivership.
[00:10:08.102 --> 00:10:09.783]  It's called shock therapy doctrine.
[00:10:09.783 --> 00:10:11.665]  We have the internal IMF World Bank documents.
[00:10:12.245 --> 00:10:15.187]  2,000 pages that were leaked in 2002.
[00:10:15.187 --> 00:10:16.948]  BBC Greg Palast covered it.
[00:10:16.948 --> 00:10:19.549]  We know exactly what they are going to do.
[00:10:19.549 --> 00:10:23.572]  They will jack up the taxes but cut out all the services.
[00:10:23.572 --> 00:10:25.793]  They will at least triple the prices of water.
[00:10:25.793 --> 00:10:27.934]  They will put toll roads on every major road.
[00:10:27.934 --> 00:10:34.158]  8,000 miles of road in Texas is their announcement just as a microcosm example.
[00:10:34.158 --> 00:10:36.239]  This is hellish what they're going to do.
[00:10:36.239 --> 00:10:39.481]  They're suddenly massively increasing water prices and privatizing it in
[00:10:41.082 --> 00:10:41.823]  Australia.
[00:10:41.823 --> 00:10:43.786]  They're suddenly doing that all over the United States.
[00:10:43.786 --> 00:10:44.367]  In England.
[00:10:44.367 --> 00:10:46.489]  It's all happening right now.
[00:10:46.489 --> 00:10:49.253]  They're going to take your jobs and raise the prices.
[00:10:50.134 --> 00:10:50.554]  I think?
[00:11:16.602 --> 00:11:17.502]  Stated plan.
[00:11:17.502 --> 00:11:21.083]  Understand, I am telling you their stated plan.
[00:11:21.083 --> 00:11:25.304]  This is 100% accurate, the information you are receiving.
[00:11:25.304 --> 00:11:27.305]  This is not my opinion.
[00:11:27.305 --> 00:11:32.006]  But now we have a clear image of just how hardcore they're going to slam this economy.
[00:11:32.006 --> 00:11:33.387]  It's worse than I thought.
[00:11:33.387 --> 00:11:35.187]  It is road warrior-ish.
[00:11:35.187 --> 00:11:39.648]  It is the road level that film about collapse of society.
[00:11:39.648 --> 00:11:41.349]  And out of that collapse will come the
[00:11:42.029 --> 00:11:49.054]  Total deindustrialization and then the completely managed society, the collectivist society of the New World Order.
[00:11:49.054 --> 00:11:56.660]  This is their stated aim at the Pentagon, at the UN, at the Club of Rome, at the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:59.062]  So let's get into the information right now.
[00:12:00.362 --> 00:12:07.246]  Finally, CBS News and others are reporting that every major poll shows Obama has dropped to 40 points at least.
[00:12:07.246 --> 00:12:11.209]  In some polls, he has a low 30% approval rating.
[00:12:11.209 --> 00:12:15.191]  In some polls, over a 70% negative approval rating.
[00:12:15.191 --> 00:12:20.855]  The Times of London, the Financial Times, the Associated Press, Reuters, Politico, Wall Street Journal,
[00:12:21.175 --> 00:12:29.924]  New York Times are all announcing that Obama is politically destroyed, and that he's not treading water, that he is sunken beneath the waves.
[00:12:29.924 --> 00:12:32.846]  It is a complete collapse.
[00:12:32.846 --> 00:12:37.851]  Suddenly, we're seeing globalist think tanks openly speaking.
[00:12:37.851 --> 00:12:38.872]  Top Clinton adviser
[00:12:39.793 --> 00:12:51.005]  Of course Mr. Shapiro and others are in the news saying if we don't have another Oklahoma City or 9-11, Obama is done and our agenda for globalization is over.
[00:12:51.005 --> 00:12:58.192]  So the elites are openly showing there's an internal debate about this, we know there is, saying look we've got to have a terror attack even if the 9-11 truthers
[00:12:59.093 --> 00:12:59.233]  I don't
[00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:29.932]  Executing and exacerbating from the oil spill to the situation with Iran, this is going to be a perfect storm.
[00:13:29.932 --> 00:13:33.973]  Obama isn't meant to survive this politically, and maybe not even physically.
[00:13:33.973 --> 00:13:35.693]  And we pray that doesn't happen.
[00:13:35.693 --> 00:13:38.054]  He is meant to be destroyed in the process.
[00:13:38.054 --> 00:13:39.994]  That is what these globalists do.
[00:13:39.994 --> 00:13:42.475]  This is how they operate.
[00:13:42.475 --> 00:13:43.595]  Now, let's go over it.
[00:13:43.595 --> 00:13:45.996]  This is a PrisonPlanet.com article.
[00:13:46.676 --> 00:13:51.799]  Directly quoting, directly quoting the Financial Times of London that came out last night.
[00:13:51.799 --> 00:13:54.281]  It was the top link on the Drudge Report.
[00:13:54.281 --> 00:13:55.101]  At about 8 p.m.
[00:13:55.101 --> 00:13:57.082]  I was up here working.
[00:13:57.082 --> 00:14:05.267]  One of the guys came over and handed me the article with it highlighted, and then I had Aaron post it, and then Paul Watson did a story this morning.
[00:14:05.267 --> 00:14:08.009]  So this is getting major attention, and that's good.
[00:14:08.009 --> 00:14:12.352]  Top Clinton official, only a terror attack can save Obama.
[00:14:12.992 --> 00:14:23.059]  Then Watson chillingly with his precise research goes through all the previous statements of the think tanks calling for staged terror attacks.
[00:14:23.059 --> 00:14:27.742]  Now, let me actually just read to you from the Financial Times of London.
[00:14:28.924 --> 00:14:30.785]  I don't know.
[00:14:53.539 --> 00:14:58.628]  Okay, this is by Mr. Shapiro, top advisor to Bill Clinton and advisor to Barack.
[00:14:59.414 --> 00:15:00.274]  Now, I just read you that quote.
[00:15:28.832 --> 00:15:36.196]  I just went over that quote for you here on air.
[00:15:36.196 --> 00:15:46.141]  Now, you dovetail that with the mindset of these people and with the Pentagon just four years ago or three years ago under Rumsfeld.
[00:15:47.571 --> 00:15:48.431]  Donald Rumsfeld
[00:16:06.536 --> 00:16:06.676]  Yes.
[00:16:24.753 --> 00:16:26.534]  You see, this is bipartisan.
[00:16:26.534 --> 00:16:30.057]  This is their crisis creation mentality.
[00:16:30.057 --> 00:16:33.140]  But it is so important to get this report out to everyone.
[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:36.562]  Top Clinton official, only a terror attack can save Obama.
[00:16:36.562 --> 00:16:40.125]  Now I'm going to go back into this in a moment, but here is another report.
[00:16:40.125 --> 00:16:42.427]  The October surprise is coming.
[00:16:43.624 --> 00:16:44.964]  And of course it is.
[00:16:44.964 --> 00:16:46.065]  Fox News.
[00:16:46.065 --> 00:16:49.305]  Outsider wins Alabama GOP governor nomination.
[00:16:49.305 --> 00:17:00.287]  Self-described outsider Robert Bentley won Alabama's Republican nomination for governor Tuesday night over established candidate Bradley Brine with a strong showing in rural areas.
[00:17:00.287 --> 00:17:02.208]  See, people are going and voting out.
[00:17:02.208 --> 00:17:04.388]  Democrats who are seen as establishment.
[00:17:04.388 --> 00:17:06.089]  Specter in the primary.
[00:17:06.089 --> 00:17:09.409]  Republicans that are seen as establishment running against Rand Paul.
[00:17:09.409 --> 00:17:10.970]  He wins in Kentucky.
[00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:11.390]  Hawaii
[00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:18.896]  Utah, Colorado, Massachusetts, you know the cases.
[00:17:18.896 --> 00:17:23.280]  This is not one party in favor, one party out of favor.
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:28.986]  The reason the system is panicking, they can always just exchange, take a left step, take a right step.
[00:17:28.986 --> 00:17:33.691]  Nobody ever looks at the body these legs are carrying, or the brain, the global central banks.
[00:17:33.691 --> 00:17:35.733]  They look at the legs, or they look at the wing.
[00:17:36.454 --> 00:17:39.476]  The left wing of the right wing, not the bird that the wings are attached to.
[00:17:39.476 --> 00:17:53.445]  That's what we focus on here is this carrion crow, is this buzzard, this vulture, this blood-drinking, corrupt, parasitic, vampiric system of oppression and corruption.
[00:17:53.445 --> 00:18:01.029]  So, the reason they're in panic mode is, and I told you this a year and a half ago, because I saw Republicans and Democrats being booted every town hall.
[00:18:01.029 --> 00:18:03.051]  The media spun it and said it was just the leftists.
[00:18:03.051 --> 00:18:04.892]  Again, getting ready to scapegoat Obama.
[00:18:05.851 --> 00:18:09.234]  The left's doing that, because they're all part of the same power structure.
[00:18:09.234 --> 00:18:11.997]  Fox News and the right wing are playing along with that.
[00:18:11.997 --> 00:18:16.121]  And they're trying to manage and impose this anti-establishment so they can hold on.
[00:18:16.121 --> 00:18:18.923]  The only one that's done it is Rick Perry so far.
[00:18:18.923 --> 00:18:23.428]  He's the only person to win as an incumbent in a primary in the last year and a half.
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:34.348]  Because he started claiming he was shooting coyotes in the city limits and wearing cowboy hats and being seen with guns every day and talking about secession and fighting the New World Order.
[00:18:34.348 --> 00:18:39.453]  I mean, he put on the coloration of an Alex Jones and so he was able to survive.
[00:18:41.994 --> 00:18:44.935]  My friends, this is so massive, what's happening.
[00:18:44.935 --> 00:18:46.775]  The elite are gonna hit you and hit you hard.
[00:18:46.775 --> 00:18:56.618]  To keep you in the left-right paradigm, they're gonna have the NAACP say, if you're against government healthcare, if you're against socialism, if you're against the carbon tax, you are a Klan member.
[00:18:56.618 --> 00:18:58.519]  They've said that in the last two days.
[00:18:58.519 --> 00:19:01.339]  To scare black people and to keep them on the reservation.
[00:19:01.339 --> 00:19:02.580]  Mecha, La Raza.
[00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:10.442]  Hey, if Arizona doesn't wanna collapse and have their whole state taken over and have thousands of dead and be the kidnapping capital of the United States, they're racist.
[00:19:10.942 --> 00:19:20.908]  But it isn't working, but that's another example of false flag terror, where they're invoking race, cold-bloodedly, knowing it has nothing to do with it, to manipulate and control people.
[00:19:20.908 --> 00:19:29.114]  The oil spill, clearly they gave orders to the operators that they knew on record in the Coast Guard report would cause the well to blow up.
[00:19:29.114 --> 00:19:35.238]  They blocked the response, they blocked the cleanup, they blocked the foreign skimmer ships to make the crisis as big as they can.
[00:19:35.238 --> 00:19:38.020]  They're gearing up for an Iran attack and now openly admitting it.
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:47.263]  While all this is going on, they're setting up their new global banking takeover, their new global government at the end of the dollar, as the world reserve currency in the background.
[00:19:47.263 --> 00:19:59.948]  That's the key to what's happening, and we'll get to the most important information straight ahead, the collapse of this republic, how it is being engineered, and how we can defeat these people straight ahead.
[00:20:02.441 --> 00:20:05.962]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[00:20:05.962 --> 00:20:08.263]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[00:20:08.263 --> 00:20:09.143]  Don't!
[00:20:09.143 --> 00:20:12.565]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[00:20:12.565 --> 00:20:19.687]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[00:20:19.667 --> 00:20:21.648]  's number one debt secret.
[00:20:21.648 --> 00:20:25.309]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[00:20:25.709 --> 00:20:28.853]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[00:20:28.853 --> 00:20:36.241]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[00:20:36.241 --> 00:20:37.422]  Herb K was right.
[00:20:37.422 --> 00:20:40.466]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[00:20:40.606 --> 00:20:41.887]  What do you have to lose?
[00:20:41.887 --> 00:20:43.109]  Stop the calls now.
[00:20:43.109 --> 00:20:45.071]  Get out of debt and have more money.
[00:20:45.071 --> 00:20:48.115]  Get Herb K's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[00:20:48.115 --> 00:20:48.715]  Call 800-405-7850.
[00:20:48.715 --> 00:20:49.316]  That's 800-405-7850.
[00:20:49.316 --> 00:20:49.356]  800-405-7850.
[00:21:03.971 --> 00:21:09.734]  The economy is crumbling, debt soaring, and the possibility of World War III is increasing.
[00:21:09.734 --> 00:21:21.819]  I started SurvivalistSeeds.com from my dining room table with a small bucket of seed and a single rotating banner ad on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:21:21.819 --> 00:21:30.083]  Two years later, we've sold over 40,000 pounds of heirloom seeds, becoming the largest bulk seed seller to the public.
[00:21:30.083 --> 00:21:33.785]  The majority of our customers are Alex Jones listeners.
[00:21:34.639 --> 00:21:50.805]  Now I'm offering 50 all organic garden varieties, 10,000 heirloom seeds, garden planner, and a CD teaching you how to save seeds so your children's children will always have healthy food.
[00:21:50.805 --> 00:21:53.526]  Don't wait until it's too late.
[00:21:53.526 --> 00:21:58.968]  I'm Vic John Lipscomb and my company is survivalistseeds.com.
[00:22:01.883 --> 00:22:08.568]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:22:08.568 --> 00:22:16.675]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:22:16.675 --> 00:22:24.521]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:22:24.841 --> 00:22:29.923]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:22:29.923 --> 00:22:35.145]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:22:35.145 --> 00:22:39.507]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:22:39.507 --> 00:22:40.587]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:40.587 --> 00:22:45.089]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[00:23:48.585 --> 00:23:50.847]  What if I say I'm not just another one of your planes?
[00:24:14.503 --> 00:24:15.844]  We're back live, my friends.
[00:24:15.844 --> 00:24:16.704]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:24:16.704 --> 00:24:18.825]  Larry Print and Richard Reeves scheduled today.
[00:24:18.825 --> 00:24:23.827]  Richard Reeves in studio.
[00:24:23.827 --> 00:24:31.851]  When I get on air and I tell you this is one of the most important, if not the most important broadcast I've ever done, it's just all the facts are out on the table.
[00:24:31.851 --> 00:24:38.374]  Everything we predicted, everything we got from the Globalist documents and think tanks and leaks is just confirmed.
[00:24:38.374 --> 00:24:39.254]  This is their plan.
[00:24:39.694 --> 00:24:49.959]  This is their program, The Designed Collapse of Society, and I'm going to talk about that collapse and how we can fight against this by exposing the culprits and the fact that it is by design.
[00:24:49.959 --> 00:25:03.165]  They're going to collapse society, blame their puppets, and then offer their solution of even more tyranny and the nanny state and the carbon tax control system through the crisis they're now orchestrating, and I'm going to cover that in a moment.
[00:25:03.165 --> 00:25:03.665]  But first,
[00:25:04.165 --> 00:25:19.315]  I cannot illustrate to you, the viewers and listeners of this radio broadcast, and the folks watching at PrisonPlanet.tv, that this report by Paul Watson, reporting on what was said in the Financial Times of London yesterday, is so essential.
[00:25:19.315 --> 00:25:21.757]  Top Clinton official.
[00:25:21.757 --> 00:25:24.959]  Only a terror attack can save America.
[00:25:26.317 --> 00:25:40.729]  A former senior advisor to President Bill Clinton says that the one thing which can rescue Barack Obama's increasingly tenuous grip on power, as his approval rating continues to plunge, is a terror attack on the scale of Oklahoma City or 9-11.
[00:25:40.729 --> 00:25:43.031]  Another startling reminder that such events only
[00:25:43.872 --> 00:25:46.393]  Ever serve to benefit those in authority.
[00:25:46.393 --> 00:26:04.518]  Buried in a Financial Times article about Obama's growing credibility crisis and fears on behalf of Democrats that they could lose not only the White House but the Senate and the House to Republicans, Robert Shapiro makes it clear that Obama is relying on an October surprise in the form of a terror attack to rescue his presidency.
[00:26:04.958 --> 00:26:07.138]  And an attack on Iran is a terror attack.
[00:26:07.138 --> 00:26:09.859]  That'll drive up oil, start real terror attacks.
[00:26:09.859 --> 00:26:11.039]  Iran's sure to strike back.
[00:26:11.039 --> 00:26:12.339]  I mean, it's going to be hellish.
[00:26:12.339 --> 00:26:15.480]  They'll be able to crack down on political dissent, take over the web.
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:19.621]  As they've been saying, they need this new cybersecurity bill to shut the web off during a war.
[00:26:19.621 --> 00:26:21.221]  You can see it all coming together.
[00:26:21.221 --> 00:26:28.803]  This is the greatest danger this country has been in since its foundation, since we were battling to start the country.
[00:26:28.803 --> 00:26:29.363]  Here's the quote.
[00:26:30.359 --> 00:26:47.738]  The bottom line here is that Americans don't believe in President Obama's leadership, said Shapiro, adding, quote, he has to find some way between now and November of demonstrating that he is a leader who can command confidence and short of a 9-11 event or an Oklahoma City bombing, I can't think of how he could do just that.
[00:26:48.379 --> 00:26:53.324]  This is why we talk about stage terror so much, because it is the ace in the hole.
[00:26:53.324 --> 00:26:55.486]  It is the royal flush.
[00:26:55.486 --> 00:26:59.029]  It is the major Trump card that they play.
[00:26:59.029 --> 00:27:03.193]  And by exposing this, we're able to stop these people.
[00:27:04.807 --> 00:27:06.990]  And the fact that the public is starting to wake up.
[00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:10.374]  I went over and saw my parents late last night when I was driving home at about 10.
[00:27:10.374 --> 00:27:20.186]  And I got the book in the car, I forget the title, but it's the best-selling New York Times, number one best-selling author, who wrote Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.
[00:27:20.186 --> 00:27:22.488]  And my dad's like, this book is about stage terror.
[00:27:23.288 --> 00:27:39.081]  You know, the book title deals with a theater fire that happened in Venice, but it talks about how, it's non-fiction, how he met with the elite of Italy and the Prime Minister and others, who I know on record exposed that our government staged terror attacks in Italy in the 70s and 80s to blame it on their political enemies.
[00:27:39.081 --> 00:27:40.682]  It's called Operation Gladio.
[00:27:40.682 --> 00:27:47.387]  But the point that a New York Times number one bestseller's new book out that's already a New York Times bestseller, and I meant to bring it in.
[00:27:47.387 --> 00:27:49.529]  In fact, guys, will you grab my keys and run out?
[00:27:49.529 --> 00:27:51.551]  It's in the passenger seat of my car.
[00:27:53.021 --> 00:28:06.896]  That my dad just grabs literature, or I mean top non-fiction book, and within 15 pages it's a book really about false flag terror.
[00:28:06.896 --> 00:28:08.178]  I mean, it's just everywhere.
[00:28:08.678 --> 00:28:11.121]  You go see movies like Children of Men.
[00:28:11.121 --> 00:28:16.386]  It's all about the government staging terror attacks and putting a sterilization chemical into the population.
[00:28:16.386 --> 00:28:20.110]  I mean most movies I see now even in fiction.
[00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:27.337]  So the point is there's been a huge awakening to the fact that all of this is going on.
[00:28:27.337 --> 00:28:28.078]  There has been
[00:28:30.132 --> 00:28:38.174]  A renaissance in understanding, almost a revelation in understanding of this and everywhere I see it in popular culture.
[00:28:38.174 --> 00:28:45.536]  And this is not just the system conditioning us, this is people rebelling who are authors and artists and filmmakers.
[00:28:45.536 --> 00:28:46.977]  I mean, I talk to a lot of these people.
[00:28:48.381 --> 00:28:54.903]  And of course, it's The City of Falling Angels by the author of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.
[00:28:54.903 --> 00:28:58.904]  And the New York Times says, a urbane and beautifully fashioned book.
[00:28:58.904 --> 00:29:00.844]  Number one New York Times bestseller.
[00:29:00.844 --> 00:29:05.025]  John Burnett, I hope I'm pronouncing that right.
[00:29:05.025 --> 00:29:05.965]  And here it is.
[00:29:08.906 --> 00:29:21.387]  It's just so incredible that on page 92 it talks about Operation Gladio and how the Italian Prime Minister talked to him about how our government stages terror attacks to set up a police state.
[00:29:23.885 --> 00:29:28.247]  And of course, this same Italian Prime Minister has gone public two years ago saying 9-11 is an inside job.
[00:29:28.247 --> 00:29:29.968]  That's not in the book, at least as far as we know.
[00:29:29.968 --> 00:29:33.170]  We haven't gotten through the book yet.
[00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:42.535]  But just a side point example of how the awakening to false flag terror is really exploding.
[00:29:42.535 --> 00:29:43.475]  Alright, we're going to come back.
[00:29:43.475 --> 00:29:49.438]  It's the most important information in this whole rant that I'm laying out and how we can stop these people.
[00:29:49.438 --> 00:29:49.999]  Straight ahead.
[00:29:49.999 --> 00:29:50.439]  Stay with us.
[00:29:52.182 --> 00:29:56.104]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

[00:32:05.123 --> 00:32:11.528]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:32:11.528 --> 00:32:18.915]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:32:18.915 --> 00:32:23.799]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[00:32:59.693 --> 00:33:02.634]  Thank you.
[00:33:02.634 --> 00:33:08.656]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:08.656 --> 00:33:11.217]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:13.641 --> 00:33:20.046]  New York Times number one best-selling authors like John Burren are writing books about real U.S.
[00:33:20.046 --> 00:33:21.707]  government stage terror.
[00:33:21.707 --> 00:33:26.570]  You know the system has got a serious, serious problem.
[00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:28.211]  And that's what's so amazing about it.
[00:33:28.211 --> 00:33:35.537]  Four years ago, Gary Hart, and we actually have a clip of this in my film Truth Rising where we are changed, talked to him.
[00:33:36.337 --> 00:33:44.828]  He wrote a public letter to Ahmadinejad and he said, the US government staged the Gulf of Tonkin and other events like the Maine.
[00:33:44.828 --> 00:33:46.930]  We will stage events in the future.
[00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:50.235]  Don't think we won't attack you if you don't do what you're told.
[00:33:50.235 --> 00:33:51.676]  We will stage terror attacks.
[00:33:51.676 --> 00:33:53.619]  And we went and talked to him and he said, yeah, I said that.
[00:33:53.619 --> 00:33:54.200]  I wrote him a letter.
[00:33:55.247 --> 00:34:00.610]  Now this is Gary Hart who wrote up the Homeland Security Plan in 1993 with Bill Clinton.
[00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:07.314]  This is the guy at the Council on Foreign Relations in 2000 with the Hart-Rudman Commission that wrote up the current plan we're living under.
[00:34:07.314 --> 00:34:12.858]  He said we're going to use this disaster, 9-11, to establish a new world order.
[00:34:12.858 --> 00:34:15.339]  Remember that quote?
[00:34:15.339 --> 00:34:16.500]  In fact, people won't believe it.
[00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:21.183]  You guys, when you get a chance, I don't need it right now, search engine the term on YouTube.
[00:34:21.183 --> 00:34:23.524]  It'll be for my films, but it was on C-SPAN.
[00:34:23.524 --> 00:34:24.765]  It'll be Gary Hart.
[00:34:26.496 --> 00:34:29.763]  Says use 9-11 for New World Order, and it's him sitting at a desk.
[00:34:29.763 --> 00:34:35.235]  We need to use this disaster for what the president's father called a New World Order.
[00:34:37.947 --> 00:34:39.387]  That's an exact quote.
[00:34:39.387 --> 00:34:42.348]  So that's why it's so important to get this article out.
[00:34:42.348 --> 00:34:47.170]  Top Clinton official, only a terror attack can save Obama.
[00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:55.972]  What have I been saying for the last six months when he went down below a 50% approval rating, now at 40 and dropping a point or so every week in free fall?
[00:34:55.972 --> 00:34:58.773]  I said, only a terror attack.
[00:34:58.773 --> 00:35:01.314]  A huge staged war will work.
[00:35:02.294 --> 00:35:03.994]  Some other type of natural disaster.
[00:35:03.994 --> 00:35:04.975]  We're now seeing that.
[00:35:04.975 --> 00:35:06.255]  Man-made natural disaster.
[00:35:06.255 --> 00:35:09.635]  It's a man-made disaster that's now a disaster in nature.
[00:35:09.635 --> 00:35:12.816]  I guess would be the proper way to put it.
[00:35:12.816 --> 00:35:15.757]  A environmental disaster.
[00:35:15.757 --> 00:35:17.157]  A border disaster.
[00:35:17.157 --> 00:35:20.137]  Notice how they tell Arizona, we're not going to let you fix that problem.
[00:35:20.137 --> 00:35:21.478]  The thousands of dead.
[00:35:21.478 --> 00:35:25.038]  You're the kidnapping capital of the United States now.
[00:35:25.038 --> 00:35:27.379]  Over 80 miles of the country off limits to citizens.
[00:35:28.479 --> 00:35:35.525]  And Obama told Senator Kyle a month ago, we can't let it get better, we've got to let it collapse so we can have a North American Union.
[00:35:35.525 --> 00:35:37.527]  So we can have legalization of the illegals.
[00:35:37.527 --> 00:35:42.051]  What did the BAMF Canada meeting 2006, declassified 2007 say?
[00:35:42.051 --> 00:35:54.663]  We will use border crises to merge Canada and Mexico into a unified security perimeter around the North American continent from Alaska to the southern border of Mexico with Guatemala.
[00:35:55.848 --> 00:35:57.469]  Don't let a good crisis go to waste.
[00:35:57.469 --> 00:35:59.591]  This is their methodology.
[00:35:59.591 --> 00:36:01.313]  We have their playbook.
[00:36:01.313 --> 00:36:02.173]  We know.
[00:36:02.173 --> 00:36:08.539]  They think you're so stupid and so pathetic that they will sit there all over the news.
[00:36:08.539 --> 00:36:17.447]  I mean, Watson's got a bunch of examples of them in the news saying Obama needs another Oklahoma City or another 9-11 with the thinnest of veiled threats.
[00:36:18.735 --> 00:36:22.279]  The... I described it earlier as as thick as a Bible page.
[00:36:22.279 --> 00:36:24.002]  I mean it is see-through.
[00:36:24.002 --> 00:36:24.022]  100%.
[00:36:24.022 --> 00:36:24.082]  And...
[00:36:28.663 --> 00:36:31.465]  They are desperate, and they are using every crisis they can.
[00:36:31.465 --> 00:36:35.429]  And remember, people say, well, this crisis, the oil's gonna destroy Obama.
[00:36:35.429 --> 00:36:39.472]  The collapsing border and this lawsuit against Arizona is gonna destroy Obama.
[00:36:39.472 --> 00:36:41.954]  Obama's socialist healthcare, it's so unpopular.
[00:36:41.954 --> 00:36:45.317]  Over 70% in polls when they passed it were against it, even higher now.
[00:36:45.317 --> 00:36:50.342]  The media puts out whitewash polls of 60% or so, 55-60.
[00:36:50.342 --> 00:36:51.222]  Why would he do this?
[00:36:51.222 --> 00:36:54.605]  Because his job is to take all the heat.
[00:36:54.605 --> 00:36:56.027]  You know, my parents have a cockatoo.
[00:36:57.205 --> 00:37:00.011]  And the cockatoo is the new world order.
[00:37:00.011 --> 00:37:04.178]  Here's my parable or analysis, analogy.
[00:37:05.572 --> 00:37:08.794]  And they put birdcage liner in every couple of days.
[00:37:08.794 --> 00:37:17.981]  They put the Austin America Statesman newspaper, the local paper, in there for its droppings and for the food it doesn't eat that drop.
[00:37:17.981 --> 00:37:20.402]  The bird wastes about half the food it eats and plays with it.
[00:37:20.402 --> 00:37:22.584]  There's all this food and crap at the bottom of it.
[00:37:22.584 --> 00:37:24.926]  And Barack Obama is the birdcage liner.
[00:37:24.926 --> 00:37:29.729]  And the New World Order is crapping on us and dropping food on us and we're blaming the birdcage liner.
[00:37:29.729 --> 00:37:32.131]  And it's nasty and it's gross and it's ugly and it's
[00:37:32.731 --> 00:37:34.675]  But still, the bird is the issue.
[00:37:34.675 --> 00:37:37.100]  George W. Bush, birdcage liner.
[00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:43.693]  Here's another analogy, or another parallel to what we're talking about.
[00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:49.751]  We're always focusing on the red cape.
[00:37:49.751 --> 00:37:50.732]  We're the bull.
[00:37:50.732 --> 00:37:52.952]  Well, we're smarter than a bull, but we don't act like that.
[00:37:52.952 --> 00:38:02.296]  And the matador uses that, that red, and he comes up and throws little darts in the back of the bull to get the bull out of sorts, angry.
[00:38:02.296 --> 00:38:03.856]  One dart is the oil spill.
[00:38:03.856 --> 00:38:05.877]  Another dart is the imploding economy.
[00:38:05.877 --> 00:38:07.498]  Another dart's the open borders.
[00:38:07.498 --> 00:38:09.499]  Another dart is socialist healthcare.
[00:38:09.499 --> 00:38:12.680]  Another dart is police refusing to stop criminals, now openly.
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:14.681]  This has always been the policy in the last hundred years.
[00:38:14.681 --> 00:38:15.401]  Now it's just public.
[00:38:16.281 --> 00:38:16.762]  I don't know.
[00:38:32.859 --> 00:38:35.241]  It's all just a little inside joke to them.
[00:39:00.967 --> 00:39:01.727]  Does that.
[00:39:01.727 --> 00:39:04.689]  And then finally the bull's got snot coming out his nose.
[00:39:04.689 --> 00:39:05.390]  He's angry.
[00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:06.410]  He's exhausted.
[00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:09.392]  This bull fight's gone on for 35 minutes.
[00:39:09.392 --> 00:39:11.693]  And the matador pulls out his sword.
[00:39:11.693 --> 00:39:13.314]  Long and sharp.
[00:39:13.314 --> 00:39:16.757]  And he puts the red cape out.
[00:39:16.757 --> 00:39:18.818]  And the bull charges and he steps aside.
[00:39:20.188 --> 00:39:22.609]  And the bull impales itself.
[00:39:22.609 --> 00:39:32.616]  The matador, with precision, stands before the New World Order crowd, and they cheer him, and they throw the rose petals at him, and the señoritas want to go out with him that night.
[00:39:32.616 --> 00:39:35.517]  And everybody buys him drinks at the bar, and he's wealthy!
[00:39:35.517 --> 00:39:36.258]  He's the star!
[00:39:38.681 --> 00:39:43.103]  I don't focus on Barack Obama, the red cape.
[00:39:43.103 --> 00:39:49.586]  I don't focus on George W. Bush or Sarah Palin or Glenn Beck being set up for a fall, the birdcage liner.
[00:39:49.586 --> 00:39:52.067]  I focus on the bird.
[00:39:52.067 --> 00:39:54.088]  I focus on the matador.
[00:39:54.088 --> 00:40:02.211]  I focus on the head, the brain, the system, the control arm, the philosophy.
[00:40:02.211 --> 00:40:06.553]  And if we are able to expose this paradigm to people, if we are able,
[00:40:07.475 --> 00:40:10.634]  To reveal this to the population.
[00:40:11.565 --> 00:40:21.569]  If we are able to cause a exponential viral understanding and common sense awakening to these tools that are used and point people at the mountains.
[00:40:21.569 --> 00:40:24.870]  Encyclopedia on top of encyclopedia of admissions.
[00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:30.713]  Because the elite, you know, there's tens of thousands of high-level minions that orchestrate this for the few hundred elite.
[00:40:30.713 --> 00:40:34.094]  Or it's even less, really, if you break it down.
[00:40:34.094 --> 00:40:37.716]  Rothkopf, the head of the Kissinger Group, in his best-selling book called it the superclass of their 6,000.
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:44.443]  Mega managers and less than 100 owners.
[00:40:44.443 --> 00:40:50.327]  They can't get away with this if you're aware of them, but they have to communicate with their 6,000 operatives.
[00:40:50.327 --> 00:40:51.968]  So it's all out there.
[00:40:51.968 --> 00:40:56.171]  It's all there for you if you'll just go pick their playbook up.
[00:40:56.171 --> 00:40:58.392]  You know, in the NFL, they guard those playbooks.
[00:40:58.392 --> 00:41:03.476]  The globalists think you're so stupid, they leave playbooks laying around all over the place for you.
[00:41:03.476 --> 00:41:08.039]  But you're too busy listening to the latest Mel Gibson family spat.
[00:41:08.919 --> 00:41:13.603]  You're too busy watching big people fall that you think are big and feeling good about yourself.
[00:41:13.603 --> 00:41:18.327]  You're too busy making fun of Lindsay Lohan and feeling powerful when she fails and is human.
[00:41:18.327 --> 00:41:26.514]  You're too busy worshipping LeBron James who has the Chosen One tattooed blasphemously on his back and on a power trip thinking he's a god.
[00:41:26.514 --> 00:41:29.316]  Life will guarantee, show him that he's just a man.
[00:41:30.137 --> 00:41:34.060]  You know, the beginning of wisdom is being humble and realizing we're all just humans.
[00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:40.085]  But together, through our species and through doing the right thing, that's what gives us beauty and power and strength and honor.
[00:41:40.085 --> 00:41:43.868]  Not being a bunch of arrogant, skin-deep fools.
[00:41:43.868 --> 00:41:47.831]  So we are at this crossroads right now.
[00:41:47.831 --> 00:41:52.595]  And I want to play for you the clip from C-SPAN.
[00:41:52.595 --> 00:41:58.940]  This was just a few days after 9-11 with the Hart-Rudman CFR Commission talking about using 9-11 for a new world order.
[00:41:58.940 --> 00:41:59.240]  Here it is.
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:15.287]  To use this disaster to carry out what his father, a phrase his father used I think only once and hasn't been used since and that is a new world order.
[00:42:15.287 --> 00:42:18.730]  New world coming.
[00:42:18.730 --> 00:42:30.258]  America will become increasingly vulnerable to hostile attack on our homeland and our military superiority will not entirely protect us.
[00:42:31.693 --> 00:42:38.615]  Americans will likely die on American soil, possibly in large.
[00:42:38.615 --> 00:42:43.116]  Yeah, that's a clip from Road to Tyranny, the worst Rez I've ever seen somebody put on YouTube.
[00:42:43.116 --> 00:42:49.237]  You can see it in high quality in my film Road to Tyranny on DVD, three hour film, breaking down their operations from 2002.
[00:42:49.237 --> 00:42:56.959]  And you watch that film today, eight years later, it's more pertinent today than when I made it because almost everything that we broke down has now come true.
[00:42:57.859 --> 00:43:00.441]  See, these films get more powerful with time.
[00:43:00.441 --> 00:43:01.461]  They're evergreen.
[00:43:01.461 --> 00:43:03.563]  They just keep coming and getting stronger.
[00:43:03.563 --> 00:43:07.385]  That's why we're having an exponential effect on the New World Order.
[00:43:07.385 --> 00:43:12.048]  There is a... Well, let's play it again, actually, since you... I mean, let's go ahead and play it.
[00:43:12.048 --> 00:43:15.170]  Go ahead and play it again.
[00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:20.653]  A phrase his father used, I think, only once, and hasn't been used since, and that is a New World Order.
[00:43:20.653 --> 00:43:22.314]  A new world coming.
[00:43:24.637 --> 00:43:30.640]  America will become increasingly vulnerable to hostile attacks on our homeland.
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:41.765]  And right there he's reading from a Council on Foreign Relations report they'd written a year ago, a year before 9-11, about how there were going to be huge terror attacks and life would change forever.
[00:43:41.765 --> 00:43:45.307]  And within 15 minutes of the attacks on CNN, Fox,
[00:43:46.207 --> 00:43:49.049]  CBS, NBC, ABC, all channels.
[00:43:49.049 --> 00:43:51.331]  They had globalists with the same talking point.
[00:43:51.331 --> 00:43:52.372]  Our life has changed.
[00:43:52.372 --> 00:43:53.733]  The new world order is here.
[00:43:53.733 --> 00:43:55.174]  You're going to have to give your rights up.
[00:43:55.174 --> 00:43:57.556]  We're going to have to attack Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:43:57.556 --> 00:43:59.277]  They had their talking points ready.
[00:43:59.277 --> 00:44:00.558]  Now, three's the charm.
[00:44:00.558 --> 00:44:03.100]  Let's play it from the start.
[00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:04.221]  Go ahead and play it again.
[00:44:04.221 --> 00:44:09.305]  There is a chance for the President of the United States to use this disaster
[00:44:10.291 --> 00:44:10.692]  Okay.
[00:44:10.692 --> 00:44:17.239]  Alright, let's go ahead now and play the clip of Sanchez on CNN two days ago talking about the horrible bombings in Africa and saying, well, this is actually helpful.
[00:44:29.733 --> 00:44:33.556]  To understand how evil the Muslims are, and if that's the case, so be it.
[00:44:33.556 --> 00:44:34.757]  Again, this is their mindset.
[00:44:34.757 --> 00:44:36.739]  You've got to think like the enemy.
[00:44:36.739 --> 00:44:42.383]  And this guy's showing off to the CIA officer, who's smiling when he says this, that, hey, I'm on the inside.
[00:44:42.383 --> 00:44:45.346]  You know, I'm Sanchez from CNN.
[00:44:45.346 --> 00:44:46.507]  I understand these things.
[00:44:46.507 --> 00:44:49.549]  This is their sick culture.
[00:44:49.549 --> 00:44:49.890]  Here it is.
[00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:51.971]  But you know what's interesting about this?
[00:44:51.971 --> 00:45:05.478]  In a strange way, the event is helpful to the cause of those of us who know how sadistic these fundamental radical Islamic terrorists are.
[00:45:05.478 --> 00:45:11.421]  And if it helps get the message out there that these are not the good guys, then so be it.
[00:45:12.981 --> 00:45:22.128]  Now folks, I'm not saying that there aren't extreme Muslims and that part of that culture and sects of it do want to take over.
[00:45:22.128 --> 00:45:23.710]  I don't want to live in Saudi Arabia.
[00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:28.934]  I mean, I don't want to live in areas like Somalia.
[00:45:30.083 --> 00:45:47.117]  But the point is, our government went in after World War II on record and radicalized Muslims as a bolster against communism and used the turban-headed guys that mutilate women and do all that as a way to overthrow secular mainline governments.
[00:45:47.117 --> 00:45:52.821]  They didn't want big glistening buildings and swimming pools and jet airplanes in the Middle East and Central Asia.
[00:45:52.821 --> 00:45:54.322]  They don't want first world nations.
[00:45:54.322 --> 00:45:57.705]  That is their set policy in the Royal Commission on Population 49.
[00:45:59.367 --> 00:46:09.556]  on State Department memorandum 200 from 1973 and literally hundreds of other declassified government documents from the US and England that we've read here on air.
[00:46:09.556 --> 00:46:22.048]  The point is they have forged radical Islam and supercharged it and opened doors for them and protected them in many cases or funded groups to fund terrorists and then opened the door for them to attack.
[00:46:23.004 --> 00:46:26.367]  And that's just a fact because they get more power and control.
[00:46:26.367 --> 00:46:33.792]  And when we got the MIAC and Homeland Security reports a year and a half ago, who was the number one target of the federal government and Homeland Security?
[00:46:33.792 --> 00:46:40.237]  And by the way, this was a reissuance of something put out in Bush's last year, but the right wing picked it up to say Obama did it.
[00:46:40.237 --> 00:46:41.178]  Well, no, he did do it.
[00:46:41.178 --> 00:46:44.620]  He continued it and accelerated it, but they're all part of the same team.
[00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:46.021]  That's the big message.
[00:46:46.021 --> 00:46:50.425]  That's the big issue here that everybody has got to understand right now.
[00:46:51.618 --> 00:46:51.778]  Yes.
[00:47:09.838 --> 00:47:11.819]  We're the people that understand the battlefield.
[00:47:11.819 --> 00:47:13.399]  We're the people that see clearly.
[00:47:13.399 --> 00:47:14.800]  We are the enemy.
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:16.420]  All of this is for us.
[00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:20.341]  If you've got a portrait of John Wayne hanging in your house, folks, you're the enemy.
[00:47:20.341 --> 00:47:21.922]  And when I say that, I mean that.
[00:47:21.922 --> 00:47:26.103]  That is what they describe, quintessentially, as their enemy.
[00:47:26.103 --> 00:47:35.606]  If you're against welfare, corporate and individual, if you're against corruption and boss hog and big city systems of oppression, you're the enemy.
[00:47:35.606 --> 00:47:37.527]  If you're red-blooded, you're the enemy.
[00:47:38.547 --> 00:47:41.672]  You're the enemy because you're not going to go along with what's about to happen.
[00:47:41.672 --> 00:47:42.754]  You can skin a buck.
[00:47:42.754 --> 00:47:47.120]  You can run a trot line.
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:48.543]  You can make homemade wine.
[00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:53.504]  You've got a rifle, a shotgun, and a four-wheel drive.
[00:47:53.504 --> 00:47:54.865]  You've got a back 40.
[00:47:54.865 --> 00:47:57.788]  When they collapse society, you've always been the enemy.
[00:47:57.788 --> 00:48:00.951]  What's about to happen has been prepared for decades.
[00:48:00.951 --> 00:48:06.016]  They practiced over and over again in third world and first world and old world nations.
[00:48:06.016 --> 00:48:08.779]  Now they're going to do it in Europe, England, and the United States.
[00:48:09.299 --> 00:48:13.942]  Now they're about to bring in the greatest crisis to establish their world government.
[00:48:13.942 --> 00:48:21.007]  And if you could skin a buck and run a trot line, and you're not going to turn your guns in, ladies and gentlemen, you're the ones they're coming after.
[00:48:21.007 --> 00:48:24.710]  You're the ones they've tried to twist the police to the dark side to think you're the enemy.
[00:48:25.310 --> 00:48:32.475]  But we're waking up the police and military, and the globalists have overreached, and we've got a good chance to blow up the Death Star.
[00:48:32.475 --> 00:48:34.937]  And I mean that figuratively, their whole system.
[00:48:34.937 --> 00:48:42.822]  We are inside the superstructure right now, ladies and gentlemen, and we are going in towards the reactor, and it is balls to the walls, 110%.
[00:48:42.822 --> 00:48:43.503]  This is it.
[00:48:43.503 --> 00:48:43.983]  This is history.
[00:48:46.525 --> 00:48:47.866]  You better understand that.
[00:48:47.866 --> 00:48:50.949]  The entire New World Order is focused on you, America.
[00:48:50.949 --> 00:48:53.152]  You can skin a buck, you can run a trot line.
[00:48:53.152 --> 00:48:54.333]  They hate your guts.
[00:48:54.333 --> 00:49:05.784]  Whether you live in Texas, or Michigan, or Northern California, or upstate New York, or the panhandle out in the boonies of Florida, or Iowa, or Illinois, or Oklahoma, they hate your guts!
[00:49:05.784 --> 00:49:10.649]  You know who the New World Order's got up on the wall in their enemy meetings where they talk about it?
[00:49:12.025 --> 00:49:20.748]  They've had Frum, who's an admitted Bilderberg Group member, writing articles about me every week in the last month saying I'm the number one enemy, and also going after Ron Paul and Rand Paul.
[00:49:21.684 --> 00:49:24.305]  They literally have got our photos up on the wall.
[00:49:24.305 --> 00:49:25.065]  We're it!
[00:49:25.065 --> 00:49:28.206]  We're all there is between total enslavement!
[00:49:28.206 --> 00:49:32.188]  And it's not that Ron Paul's perfect, or Alex Jones perfect, or that we're these great leaders.
[00:49:32.188 --> 00:49:41.311]  It's that we're the people that were at least real enough to have a focus, to stand up, to be involved, to speak out, to analyze the enemy attack profile correctly.
[00:49:41.311 --> 00:49:46.153]  We know exactly who the enemy are, and they can't stand it that we're communicating this information to you.
[00:49:47.202 --> 00:49:48.663]  I'm getting chills right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:48.663 --> 00:49:49.944]  This is so real.
[00:49:49.944 --> 00:49:52.125]  And even I can't believe it's all coming to fruition.
[00:49:52.125 --> 00:49:55.907]  Even I can't believe this system is that corrupt and this evil.
[00:49:55.907 --> 00:49:57.088]  But it's real.
[00:49:57.088 --> 00:49:59.089]  It's happening.
[00:49:59.089 --> 00:50:00.770]  And so they're going to collapse the borders.
[00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:02.070]  They're going to collapse the dollar.
[00:50:02.070 --> 00:50:04.252]  They're going to collapse the credit system.
[00:50:04.252 --> 00:50:08.334]  They are going to coast-to-coast lay off large portions of police and fire.
[00:50:08.334 --> 00:50:09.655]  It's already happening.
[00:50:09.655 --> 00:50:13.437]  And they are going to tell the public, as is in the case with Oakland,
[00:50:15.253 --> 00:50:20.397]  That they are not even going to respond to.
[00:50:20.397 --> 00:50:23.940]  These are the 40 things the police chief put out.
[00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:37.310]  Burglary, theft, embezzlement, grand theft, grand theft dog, identity theft, false information to peace officer, required to register a sex offender or arson offender, dump waste or offensive matter, discard appliance with lock, loud music.
[00:50:38.223 --> 00:50:39.904]  Possesses forged notes.
[00:50:39.904 --> 00:50:41.405]  Passed fictitious check.
[00:50:41.405 --> 00:50:43.566]  Obtained money by false voucher.
[00:50:43.566 --> 00:50:46.027]  Fraudulent use of access cards.
[00:50:46.027 --> 00:50:47.348]  Stolen license plates.
[00:50:47.348 --> 00:50:49.409]  Embezzlement by employee.
[00:50:49.409 --> 00:50:50.109]  Extortion.
[00:50:50.109 --> 00:50:51.090]  Attempted extortion.
[00:50:51.090 --> 00:50:53.591]  False personification of other.
[00:50:53.591 --> 00:50:56.453]  Injured telephone line or infrastructure.
[00:50:56.453 --> 00:50:58.154]  Interfere with power line.
[00:50:58.154 --> 00:50:59.595]  Poison people.
[00:50:59.595 --> 00:51:00.975]  Administer poison.
[00:51:00.975 --> 00:51:01.616]  Vandalism.
[00:51:02.136 --> 00:51:06.677]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:51:06.677 --> 00:51:07.597]  Number 1.
[00:51:07.597 --> 00:51:11.018]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:51:11.018 --> 00:51:11.878]  Number 2.
[00:51:11.878 --> 00:51:16.780]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:17.520]  It's true.
[00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:22.381]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:51:22.381 --> 00:51:23.221]  Number 3.
[00:51:23.221 --> 00:51:26.802]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:51:26.802 --> 00:51:30.503]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:51:30.703 --> 00:51:31.504]  Number 4.
[00:51:31.504 --> 00:51:34.267]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:51:34.267 --> 00:51:37.951]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:51:37.951 --> 00:51:38.731]  Number 5.
[00:51:38.731 --> 00:51:42.896]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:51:42.896 --> 00:51:47.661]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:52:11.454 --> 00:52:13.877]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:52:13.877 --> 00:52:19.743]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[00:52:19.743 --> 00:52:25.989]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:52:26.409 --> 00:52:32.394]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:52:32.394 --> 00:52:36.557]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:52:36.557 --> 00:52:40.861]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:52:40.861 --> 00:52:46.806]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:52:46.806 --> 00:52:50.369]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:52:50.369 --> 00:52:52.330]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:52:52.330 --> 00:52:52.771]  It's here.

[00:54:13.217 --> 00:54:14.557]  You didn't take any chances.
[00:54:14.557 --> 00:54:16.518]  You were a prisoner of doubt.
[00:54:16.518 --> 00:54:26.662]  If you sit on the fence, if you sit on the bench during this incredible battle for free humanity, we're going to lose.
[00:54:26.662 --> 00:54:32.644]  The only way the enemy can win is if you don't turn your liberty spirit loose.
[00:54:32.644 --> 00:54:38.146]  If you can just feel that strength of your ancestors rising in you to defend our women and our children,
[00:54:39.485 --> 00:54:44.492]  If you can commit, not care what your neighbors and people around you think, they will see the leadership.
[00:54:44.492 --> 00:54:47.897]  They will see the strength and they will stand up and be right beside you.
[00:54:49.588 --> 00:54:50.909]  Now, I want to be clear here.
[00:54:50.909 --> 00:55:06.322]  They have decided that you're coddled, you're decadent, you're obsessed with the system, you're scared, they can hold your pension funds hostage a year and a half ago and steal trillions of dollars with a bailout, and they think you'll accept losing part of your pensions to, quote, keep them.
[00:55:06.322 --> 00:55:08.044]  All of this is being announced now.
[00:55:08.044 --> 00:55:12.447]  They think that when they implode society and the police stop showing up at your house,
[00:55:13.359 --> 00:55:22.748]  That you're gonna panic and become even more domesticated and say, I'll take carbon taxes, I'll do whatever you say, just turn the economy back on.
[00:55:22.748 --> 00:55:26.252]  I'll accept a war with Iran, just turn the economy back on.
[00:55:26.252 --> 00:55:28.073]  They are holding you hostage with the border.
[00:55:28.073 --> 00:55:29.395]  What did Obama tell Senator Kyle?
[00:55:30.069 --> 00:55:39.700]  We can't fix the border and all the deaths and the kidnapping because we need that as a crisis to get amnesty, which is the North American Union, the guest worker program, the wide open system.
[00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:48.010]  It's all stated by the public CFR report that they admit is word for word the legislation that Bush introduced three times and that Obama's introduced.
[00:55:49.252 --> 00:55:50.952]  It's word for word the same.
[00:55:50.952 --> 00:55:52.733]  It's congruency between them.
[00:55:52.733 --> 00:55:54.413]  It just continues.
[00:55:54.413 --> 00:55:57.454]  And they know you're waking up and they know there's been a realignment.
[00:55:57.454 --> 00:56:07.916]  And so you think about the magnitude of that, because not only is Oakland cutting cops and holding people hostage and saying we won't respond to robbery and muggings and poison.
[00:56:07.916 --> 00:56:10.857]  It says if you poison someone, they won't respond.
[00:56:10.857 --> 00:56:13.798]  And sabotaging power poles.
[00:56:13.798 --> 00:56:14.738]  I mean, this is insane.
[00:56:15.478 --> 00:56:17.520]  This is actually under the Patriot Act.
[00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:21.603]  But they're not going to enforce it because they want increased pay.
[00:56:21.603 --> 00:56:22.404]  They want increased money.
[00:56:22.404 --> 00:56:23.625]  They're holding you hostage.
[00:56:23.625 --> 00:56:25.266]  They're saying, we're not going to fix the roads.
[00:56:25.266 --> 00:56:27.208]  We're not going to put new police radios in.
[00:56:27.208 --> 00:56:31.392]  We're not going to do anything unless you capitulate and thumbprint to get guns.
[00:56:31.392 --> 00:56:35.175]  And they're actually increasing funding for anti-gun programs in California.
[00:56:35.475 --> 00:56:43.280]  I talk to people I know that live in very wealthy neighborhoods of Los Angeles and Beverly Hills, and major roads wash out a year ago, they don't fix them now.
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:44.401]  They just shut roads.
[00:56:44.401 --> 00:56:49.364]  They've announced in the LA Times they're not going to fix major roads and sidewalks a few months ago.
[00:56:49.364 --> 00:56:51.485]  The same thing is happening all over the country.
[00:56:51.485 --> 00:56:57.209]  Remember that story out of Ohio, where they've laid off from 112 deputies to 49?
[00:56:57.209 --> 00:56:58.810]  And the sheriff was honest there.
[00:56:58.810 --> 00:57:04.514]  He said, by guns, we can't protect you one deputy to respond to calls every shift.
[00:57:05.254 --> 00:57:11.405]  Of the other 43, or 49, they are all to work at the jail and revenue generation.
[00:57:12.273 --> 00:57:26.479]  So, police, starting in Chicago about 100 years ago, in New York in the last 70 or so, memos have even come out that have been in the news, and a police chief got recorded, what, 20-something years ago in Chicago saying, we're here to increase crime.
[00:57:26.479 --> 00:57:28.559]  We don't want to keep violent offenders.
[00:57:28.559 --> 00:57:34.602]  We want to get non-violent, and we need some criminals out there to scare the public to thinking they need us.
[00:57:35.669 --> 00:57:41.153]  Notice the more cops we get, we've got three times conservatively the police nationwide we had 15 years ago.
[00:57:41.153 --> 00:57:43.115]  They've tripled or more.
[00:57:43.115 --> 00:57:47.719]  But suddenly, folks, I had my car stolen, what, 15 years ago in Dallas.
[00:57:47.719 --> 00:57:49.720]  Then it got stolen a second time.
[00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:51.222]  I'd go up there and visit a girlfriend.
[00:57:51.222 --> 00:57:53.643]  Got stolen twice from a decent area of Dallas.
[00:57:53.643 --> 00:57:56.205]  The police wouldn't even show up.
[00:57:56.205 --> 00:58:00.109]  Wouldn't even show up to her apartment when it happened.
[00:58:01.118 --> 00:58:07.961]  And now they're just being public about the fact that they're there for revenue generation, and they're going to let society collapse.
[00:58:07.961 --> 00:58:11.282]  And these are coming in from Florida, these are coming in everywhere.
[00:58:11.282 --> 00:58:22.367]  They're saying burglary, theft, embezzlement, grand theft, extortion, embezzlement, attempted extortion, false persification of other.
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:25.421]  Injured telephone or power line.
[00:58:25.421 --> 00:58:26.902]  Interfere with power line.
[00:58:26.902 --> 00:58:29.124]  Unauthorized cable TV connection.
[00:58:29.124 --> 00:58:29.684]  Vandalism.
[00:58:29.684 --> 00:58:31.085]  So they mix petty things in.
[00:58:31.085 --> 00:58:34.327]  Administer exposed poison to another's.
[00:58:34.327 --> 00:58:36.448]  Poisoning people is now okay.
[00:58:36.448 --> 00:58:37.489]  Do you understand?
[00:58:37.489 --> 00:58:43.973]  They are purposefully imploding the country.
[00:58:43.973 --> 00:58:46.595]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:46.595 --> 00:58:49.857]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:53.561 --> 00:58:57.522]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:58:57.522 --> 00:59:06.383]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:59:06.383 --> 00:59:11.024]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:59:11.024 --> 00:59:21.826]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:59:22.466 --> 00:59:31.988]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:59:31.988 --> 00:59:37.410]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:59:37.410 --> 00:59:44.891]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:59:44.891 --> 00:59:47.652]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:59:54.770 --> 00:59:57.151]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:57.151 --> 01:00:06.837]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:06.837 --> 01:00:08.138]  Big Brother.
[01:00:08.138 --> 01:00:09.899]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:09.899 --> 01:00:11.080]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:13.241]  You want answers?
[01:00:13.241 --> 01:00:14.802]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:14.802 --> 01:00:18.984]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.984 --> 01:00:23.067]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:26.158 --> 01:00:26.658]  I don't know.
[01:00:46.636 --> 01:00:57.007]  We've covered how the Financial Times of London and others are reporting Obama is in free fall and needs a staged terror attack like Oklahoma City or 9-11 to quote, be a strong leader.
[01:00:57.007 --> 01:00:59.510]  To make us rally around him.
[01:00:59.510 --> 01:01:01.512]  Like a bunch of, you know, scared children.
[01:01:02.892 --> 01:01:19.486]  We know all over the country, every day I see reports where they're announcing they're laying off a third, a half, or more, or more of the police and saying the police are only allowed to revenue generate, we will not respond to robberies, to muggings, to home invasions, buy a gun.
[01:01:19.486 --> 01:01:23.430]  At least in Ohio and Michigan where they've announced this, they're saying buy a gun.
[01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:28.614]  Not in California, they're saying you're not gonna have a gun, we're gonna try to restrict that, and we're not gonna protect you.
[01:01:29.435 --> 01:01:31.397]  Unless you accept higher taxes.
[01:01:31.397 --> 01:01:34.539]  They raise the taxes and the economy implodes.
[01:01:34.539 --> 01:01:36.601]  They know it's going to do that.
[01:01:36.601 --> 01:01:45.409]  And they want to get all the parasites and all the dependents and all the little thugs that enjoy their petty power through the system and the uniforms that they animate.
[01:01:45.409 --> 01:01:47.831]  They want to get them all riled up and scared.
[01:01:49.767 --> 01:01:52.790]  So that they will go along with the oppression that's coming.
[01:01:52.790 --> 01:01:55.352]  They are going to shut off the power.
[01:01:55.352 --> 01:01:57.274]  They are going to increase the water prices.
[01:01:57.274 --> 01:01:59.976]  They are going to drive you into submission.
[01:01:59.976 --> 01:02:01.838]  They've done this in the third world.
[01:02:01.838 --> 01:02:03.159]  It's called shock therapy.
[01:02:03.159 --> 01:02:05.742]  This is a stated program, 100%.
[01:02:05.742 --> 01:02:09.825]  And we know what they are doing.
[01:02:09.825 --> 01:02:10.746]  And it is treason.
[01:02:11.687 --> 01:02:13.427]  It is outrageous.
[01:02:13.427 --> 01:02:21.309]  Those police officers should walk off the force and say, we're going to protest until you say that we're going to respond to crime.
[01:02:21.309 --> 01:02:25.050]  Again, we have triple the cops we had 15 years ago, conservatively.
[01:02:25.050 --> 01:02:28.070]  They're trying to expand them again with taxpayer money.
[01:02:28.070 --> 01:02:31.711]  And you can't get a cop when you need one most of the time in these big mega cities.
[01:02:31.711 --> 01:02:33.131]  A lot of towns are still decent.
[01:02:33.131 --> 01:02:37.372]  Austin, when I've needed the police, they've come out and been very nice and done a good job.
[01:02:38.632 --> 01:02:49.340]  But more and more in other areas of the country, we see where you call the police to your house, there's been a break-in, and they taser and beat up an old woman on squad car video.
[01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:54.564]  And in this latest case, they did the right thing and fired the cops, but who are these lunatics they're hiring?
[01:02:54.564 --> 01:02:56.305]  We obviously need police.
[01:02:56.305 --> 01:03:04.871]  I know it's a tough job, but we need a smaller, lean, focused, serious force that tracks down violent offenders and keeps them in jail.
[01:03:04.871 --> 01:03:06.453]  I mean, now, in Oakland,
[01:03:07.153 --> 01:03:08.914]  Here's the bigger issue.
[01:03:08.914 --> 01:03:19.681]  What happens when the Oakland Police Chief announces they won't respond to burglary, theft, embezzlement, grand theft auto, grand theft dog, identity theft, extortion, attempted extortion?
[01:03:22.406 --> 01:03:26.648]  Administer, expose poison to another, vandalism.
[01:03:26.648 --> 01:03:27.649]  What is that message?
[01:03:27.649 --> 01:03:35.073]  I mean, it's almost like Devil's Night or something in Detroit, where all the criminals go out and burn things at once so the police can't respond.
[01:03:35.073 --> 01:03:38.675]  This is the police saying, we're going to take a hike, just like New Orleans.
[01:03:38.675 --> 01:03:50.601]  Instead, the cops were tying chains to jewelry stores and pawn shops, stealing guns and jewelry and dragging safes down the road behind them and going into Walmart and kicking everybody out looting so the cops can walk out with big screen TVs.
[01:03:50.601 --> 01:03:52.002]  I'm not here bashing police.
[01:03:52.242 --> 01:03:53.823]  I know they're the good, the bad, and the ugly.
[01:03:53.823 --> 01:03:55.424]  They're a mix, like everybody else.
[01:03:55.424 --> 01:03:57.286]  But they recruit slime.
[01:03:57.286 --> 01:03:58.727]  They recruit scum.
[01:03:58.727 --> 01:04:01.089]  They recruit people with low IQs.
[01:04:01.089 --> 01:04:02.990]  That's on record in many police departments.
[01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:05.272]  You can't have above an average IQ.
[01:04:05.272 --> 01:04:10.796]  Because with wisdom, most of the time comes decency and people being honorable.
[01:04:10.796 --> 01:04:13.358]  They want a bunch of dumb goons they can manipulate.
[01:04:14.966 --> 01:04:21.167]  And then if you get sick at a 9-11 rescue, or you get sick cleaning up oil, and you're begging for help as a cop, you're not gonna get it.
[01:04:21.167 --> 01:04:25.848]  And once you're not a cop anymore, and once you're out of the military and the internal documents, you're the number one enemy.
[01:04:25.848 --> 01:04:27.628]  You're who the NSA is watching.
[01:04:27.628 --> 01:04:29.348]  You're the people they hate.
[01:04:29.348 --> 01:04:33.849]  It's time for everyone to make a decision and decide, which side do you stand for?
[01:04:33.849 --> 01:04:35.109]  Which side are you on?
[01:04:35.109 --> 01:04:37.550]  The good news is there's a huge awakening to all this.
[01:04:37.550 --> 01:04:43.111]  But the larger question is, what are some things we can do that are real world to counter this?
[01:04:43.111 --> 01:04:44.271]  And we'll talk about that
[01:04:44.771 --> 01:04:51.700]  After this break and have Jaron Neihardt in here with an amazing story he told me this morning, something I experienced last week.
[01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:57.527]  Then we've got Richard Reeves coming up, Larry Pratt, and we'll have some time in the middle of the next hour to take phone calls.
[01:04:57.527 --> 01:04:58.228]  Please stay with us.
[01:04:58.228 --> 01:05:00.511]  The websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:06.364]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:06.364 --> 01:05:07.284]  Number 1.
[01:05:07.284 --> 01:05:10.707]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:10.707 --> 01:05:11.568]  Number 2.
[01:05:11.568 --> 01:05:16.451]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:16.451 --> 01:05:17.192]  It's true.
[01:05:17.192 --> 01:05:22.076]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:22.076 --> 01:05:22.896]  Number 3.
[01:05:22.896 --> 01:05:26.479]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:26.479 --> 01:05:30.182]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:30.382 --> 01:05:31.183]  Number 4.
[01:05:31.183 --> 01:05:33.945]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:33.945 --> 01:05:37.628]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:37.628 --> 01:05:38.409]  Number 5.
[01:05:38.409 --> 01:05:42.553]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:42.553 --> 01:05:47.317]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:47.597 --> 01:05:51.782]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:05:55.827 --> 01:05:58.169]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:06:01.721 --> 01:06:03.402]  Listen up folks, this is important.
[01:06:03.402 --> 01:06:04.523]  Alex Jones here.
[01:06:04.523 --> 01:06:12.869]  Now you can get free shipping on the storable, easy to fix, delicious food from efoodsdirect.com from July 4th through July 14th.
[01:06:12.869 --> 01:06:18.694]  We have looming evacuations in the southeast, unemployment insurance running out, and predictions of huge inflation.

[01:08:05.419 --> 01:08:10.122]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:10.122 --> 01:08:16.946]  The United States and the world is being collapsed so it can be reorganized under a planetary dictatorship.
[01:08:16.946 --> 01:08:21.849]  This is a public policy by the White House science czar John P. Holdren and countless others.
[01:08:21.849 --> 01:08:25.752]  They call it a planetary police state to carry out eugenics.
[01:08:27.346 --> 01:08:39.714]  We're gonna be discussing this and how we counter them and how we fight back and why I am coming out and saying that it's a 100% confirmed they are going ahead with this unless we get the word out like we never have before.
[01:08:39.714 --> 01:08:43.377]  And I'll explain that more and solutions to counter this in just a moment.
[01:08:43.377 --> 01:08:46.819]  First, I wanted to tell you about MySolarBackup.com.
[01:08:46.819 --> 01:08:50.061]  That's the website where you can call and get a free information pack by calling 877-327-0365.
[01:08:50.061 --> 01:08:51.422]  It's a wonderful plug-and-play solar-powered system.
[01:08:57.906 --> 01:08:59.708]  And our listeners have just loved them.
[01:08:59.708 --> 01:09:02.330]  We've been promoting them for almost three years now.

[01:09:26.687 --> 01:09:36.051]  This is the last day, July 14th, if you get the order in today, online or by calling, to get free shipping, which is a big part of the cost of high-quality, storable foods, from efoodsdirect.com.

[01:09:58.686 --> 01:10:01.508]  You will never stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:10:01.508 --> 01:10:13.338]  Now, I want to get into solutions in the rest of this segment, and then more coming up later in the hour after Richard Reeves leaves us, but that's also a big part of the solution, what he's going to be here talking about.
[01:10:13.338 --> 01:10:14.999]  But the biggest issue is being awake.
[01:10:15.805 --> 01:10:19.610]  And a big part of that is realizing how much power the individual has.
[01:10:19.610 --> 01:10:29.623]  The establishment wouldn't be moving to curtail the internet and openly censor, quote, conspiracy theories, and they give the example at the White House and FCC of denying man-made global warming.
[01:10:31.272 --> 01:10:34.334]  Or denying the official story of 9-11.
[01:10:34.334 --> 01:10:36.636]  Or denying the official story of Oklahoma City.
[01:10:36.636 --> 01:10:38.578]  Or denying WMDs.
[01:10:38.578 --> 01:10:42.881]  Or they call it a conspiracy theory that China sells organs when China's on record saying they do.
[01:10:42.881 --> 01:10:48.185]  These are the things the State Department and the FCC and the Diversity Czar at the White House have all said.
[01:10:48.185 --> 01:10:50.487]  It's what Cass Sunstein, the Regulations Czar, has said.
[01:10:50.487 --> 01:11:00.695]  Why would they want to start shutting down free speech and curtailing talk radio free speech with the Fairness Doctrine if, that's if, we weren't having an effect?
[01:11:02.031 --> 01:11:04.452]  And I'm only one person in this fight against the New World Order.
[01:11:04.452 --> 01:11:08.373]  The real power of this radio broadcast is you taking action.
[01:11:08.373 --> 01:11:23.079]  And if we're able to expose that the private central banks orchestrated the collapse, if we're able to expose their lying about WMDs with Iran, just like they did seven years ago with Iraq, if we're able to expose the fact that they're holding us hostage with the open borders, and that it's their policy to have them open,
[01:11:23.519 --> 01:11:25.041]  They're arrogance is what's going to undo them.
[01:11:25.041 --> 01:11:27.443]  Obama admits he wants the crisis to get worse.
[01:11:27.443 --> 01:11:34.750]  That they're trying to bankrupt states with unfunded mandates so they can be federalized and thus internationalized.
[01:11:34.750 --> 01:11:38.293]  All of this is admitted and they want you to feel powerless.
[01:11:38.293 --> 01:11:40.396]  But ladies and gentlemen, I know the power of the individual.
[01:11:40.956 --> 01:11:45.939]  Fifteen years ago, when I first got on air, I just wanted to fight for the Second Amendment, be one voice of millions.
[01:11:45.939 --> 01:11:48.941]  I never had any imagination of even having a radio show.
[01:11:48.941 --> 01:11:51.943]  Did an access show for a few months.
[01:11:51.943 --> 01:11:53.264]  Local station went to talk.
[01:11:53.264 --> 01:11:54.885]  They said, we'd like to give you a Saturday show.
[01:11:54.885 --> 01:11:56.146]  It got a lot of listeners and ratings.
[01:11:56.146 --> 01:11:57.546]  They gave me a weekday show.
[01:11:57.546 --> 01:11:59.628]  Then it got syndicated thirteen years ago.
[01:12:00.388 --> 01:12:01.389]  That's another example.
[01:12:01.389 --> 01:12:11.918]  When I started InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, I had no intention of them being the number one alternative websites, number one and number two in the world, and growing exponentially.
[01:12:11.918 --> 01:12:17.743]  But it just shows with how if you just start resisting in a small way, that's how you'll get better.
[01:12:17.743 --> 01:12:21.246]  And there's so many of us that we're unstoppable if we take action.
[01:12:21.246 --> 01:12:25.449]  Now, again, think about just what I've done with the films.
[01:12:25.449 --> 01:12:28.052]  Hundreds and hundreds of millions of free views online.
[01:12:28.976 --> 01:12:30.577]  That's what I value is waking people up.
[01:12:30.577 --> 01:12:31.839]  The Obama deception.
[01:12:31.839 --> 01:12:33.500]  Fall of the Republic.
[01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:34.761]  Endgame.
[01:12:34.761 --> 01:12:35.702]  All of these films.
[01:12:35.702 --> 01:12:37.063]  Invisible Empire.
[01:12:37.063 --> 01:12:37.864]  Truth Rising.
[01:12:37.864 --> 01:12:40.046]  Loose Change Final Cut that I produced.
[01:12:40.046 --> 01:12:41.147]  All of that.
[01:12:41.147 --> 01:12:43.549]  Hundreds and hundreds of millions conservatively.
[01:12:43.549 --> 01:12:45.350]  I have more than 8 YouTube channels.
[01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:48.593]  With more than 150 million views between them.
[01:12:48.593 --> 01:12:50.575]  Not counting the thousands of other channels.
[01:12:50.575 --> 01:12:52.257]  And hundreds of millions of views.
[01:12:52.257 --> 01:12:53.257]  That's just with YouTube.
[01:12:53.257 --> 01:12:54.178]  And we use other tools.
[01:12:54.178 --> 01:12:55.459]  Talk radio.
[01:12:55.459 --> 01:12:55.840]  Everything.
[01:12:56.735 --> 01:13:16.642]  The news websites, think of what we've done, and here's just a few examples of why enemy operatives, COINTELPRO, are revealing themselves in the fake patriot movement, that is areas that are fake, in the mainstream media, multiple Bilderberg Group journalists openly attacking me every week in international publications saying I'm a dangerous enemy.
[01:13:16.642 --> 01:13:20.663]  Because I've analyzed their attack profile, I know what they're doing, and I know how to stop them.
[01:13:21.283 --> 01:13:27.728]  Now here's just an example of the power of the individual and how it ties together with you, the listeners.
[01:13:27.728 --> 01:13:30.010]  How it ties together with you, the power.
[01:13:30.010 --> 01:13:36.034]  The reason this show has power is because I take action, we put out quality information, but that's a small part of the equation.
[01:13:36.034 --> 01:13:38.296]  You magnify it a billion times.
[01:13:38.296 --> 01:13:39.257]  No exaggeration.
[01:13:39.257 --> 01:13:42.600]  A billion times, conservatively, you magnify what I do.
[01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:48.122]  And an example of that is I came in here last week and told the crew and then said on air that it was weird.
[01:13:48.122 --> 01:13:53.144]  I was listening to a syndicated show out of San Antonio and they were talking about me in a positive way.
[01:13:53.144 --> 01:13:59.427]  And then I flipped the channel to 590 AM and the Todd and Don Show had a caller call in and said they want to censor the internet.
[01:13:59.427 --> 01:14:00.928]  The world government's taking over.
[01:14:00.928 --> 01:14:02.669]  They want to shut down Alex Jones.
[01:14:02.669 --> 01:14:04.890]  And you know the local host made a joke about it.
[01:14:04.890 --> 01:14:09.192]  But the point is that that was just in a few minutes of listening.
[01:14:10.032 --> 01:14:10.352]  I don't know.
[01:14:26.247 --> 01:14:29.168]  Not twice in a row, three times in a row.
[01:14:29.168 --> 01:14:39.571]  And that's an example of you, the callers, just calling in to talk radio and the type of magnification that it is having and the buzz that it is creating.
[01:14:39.571 --> 01:14:46.033]  If we take that model and you do that yourself in your own town, your own city, it may just be a buzz on your block.
[01:14:46.033 --> 01:14:47.874]  It may be a buzz in your town or your state.
[01:14:49.204 --> 01:14:50.965]  Resistance is victory.
[01:14:50.965 --> 01:14:53.526]  And I want to go to Jaron Neihardt and talk about this.
[01:14:53.526 --> 01:14:55.606]  Jaron, briefly tell folks what happened this morning.
[01:14:55.606 --> 01:14:57.227]  Yeah, actually I woke up about 8 o'clock.
[01:14:57.227 --> 01:15:02.229]  I always set my alarm clock to 93.7, a local show here in town, Dudley and Bob.
[01:15:02.229 --> 01:15:06.431]  And a caller actually called in asking if they could get you on the show.
[01:15:06.431 --> 01:15:10.832]  They're talking about the FCC ruling, the ruling against the FCC.
[01:15:10.832 --> 01:15:14.754]  They went on for about five minutes saying, yeah, we should have them back in talking about you.
[01:15:14.754 --> 01:15:15.514]  I turned that off.
[01:15:15.874 --> 01:15:16.154]  I don't
[01:15:36.204 --> 01:15:41.407]  Joe Rogan's on his podcast talking about you, doing an impression actually, but talking about you.
[01:15:41.407 --> 01:15:43.808]  It almost short-circuited me for a second.
[01:15:43.808 --> 01:15:50.891]  The thing was, he's got people on his podcast, the UFC guy Eddie Bravo, they all talk about you like, just Alex.
[01:15:50.891 --> 01:15:53.933]  Hey, Alex does this, Alex says this, and everybody seems to know.
[01:15:53.933 --> 01:15:55.814]  It was the same thing on KLBJ when I heard it.
[01:15:55.814 --> 01:16:02.137]  I didn't hear the Case 101 part, but they just talk about, yeah, Alex comes in, Alex says this, and it's almost like just a...
[01:16:02.757 --> 01:16:03.658]  Everybody's aware.
[01:16:03.658 --> 01:16:05.820]  I see it when, you know, when the Drudge Report comes out.
[01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:07.041]  I didn't even tell you this the other day.
[01:16:07.041 --> 01:16:13.467]  I Google search every morning, just New World Order, global governance, to see what articles it comes up in.
[01:16:13.467 --> 01:16:19.053]  And two days ago, it sent me to a link, a TMZ link about Jesse James.
[01:16:19.053 --> 01:16:27.380]  It had no relevance to anything, and I actually controlled F, searched it to see where New World Order popped up, and somebody had posted an InfoWars story in the comments section.
[01:16:28.382 --> 01:16:45.264]  By JT Coyote a couple of days ago, so it's just everywhere you turn the message is getting out It's just you know just the the viral nature of it It's just kind of fascinating but and within about a minute of itself three times today on three separate radio shows They were talking about you
[01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:48.141]  And this was one after the other.
[01:16:48.141 --> 01:16:48.402]  Oh, yeah.
[01:16:48.402 --> 01:16:50.963]  I mean, you're just like, because I mean, I'm in the car and I go to one channel.
[01:16:50.963 --> 01:16:55.366]  They're talking about me and I and then and then I flip to another and they're talking about me.
[01:16:55.366 --> 01:16:57.428]  And I didn't I mean, it was just insane.
[01:16:57.428 --> 01:16:58.969]  And more and more that's happening.
[01:16:58.969 --> 01:17:02.491]  And I'm hearing from family and friends and other parts of the country.
[01:17:02.491 --> 01:17:04.493]  I'm hearing of people in other nations.
[01:17:04.493 --> 01:17:07.135]  I'm hearing in Czechoslovakia and Russia and Japan.
[01:17:07.135 --> 01:17:08.516]  It's info wars everywhere.
[01:17:08.516 --> 01:17:12.598]  And and but but but the issue is, it's not about Alex Jones.
[01:17:13.479 --> 01:17:17.741]  It's about the power of individuals together with an idea and how ideas are bulletproof.
[01:17:17.741 --> 01:17:19.182]  They can kill Alex Jones.
[01:17:19.182 --> 01:17:22.783]  I've been getting death threats and a lot of other stuff lately, but I'm not scared of that.
[01:17:22.783 --> 01:17:38.430]  My mission is to defeat the New World Order so my children have a future and so my great-great-grandchildren can look at a hologram photo of me or whatever they're looking at in the future and go, you know, we're proud of him, you know, and then I can be an example to them just like my ancestors were an example to me.
[01:17:39.170 --> 01:17:39.310]  Yeah.
[01:17:57.958 --> 01:17:59.480]  I mean, I'm not sitting here tooting my horn.
[01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:01.183]  Everybody has that in their background.
[01:18:01.183 --> 01:18:02.305]  I want my ancestors.
[01:18:02.305 --> 01:18:03.747]  I mean, I want to keep living.
[01:18:03.747 --> 01:18:04.508]  I don't want to die.
[01:18:04.508 --> 01:18:05.990]  But I'm actually not even afraid.
[01:18:05.990 --> 01:18:06.711]  I'm really living.
[01:18:06.711 --> 01:18:09.936]  This is, as a man, I am supposed to stand up for humanity.
[01:18:09.936 --> 01:18:11.438]  I'm supposed to stand up against evil.
[01:18:11.438 --> 01:18:12.800]  I'm not supposed to be a coward.
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:13.421]  And the weird thing is...
[01:18:14.142 --> 01:18:18.904]  I might have been scared 15 years ago a little bit, maybe scared to get in front of a crowd more than I was scared of getting killed.
[01:18:18.904 --> 01:18:20.105]  I wasn't even thinking about that.
[01:18:20.105 --> 01:18:21.946]  Now I'm not even worried.
[01:18:21.946 --> 01:18:24.087]  And I kind of got to remember, well, I want to continue my mission.
[01:18:24.087 --> 01:18:25.668]  I need to kind of look over my shoulder.
[01:18:25.668 --> 01:18:26.888]  I need to still watch out.
[01:18:26.888 --> 01:18:27.749]  But I'm not.
[01:18:27.749 --> 01:18:34.732]  It's such an empowering feeling to know we've got the truth, to know we're having a historic effect and the system is fully aware.
[01:18:34.732 --> 01:18:36.473]  That's why they've had two separate journalists.
[01:18:37.219 --> 01:18:43.064]  And Watson's written about this in international publications write whole stories about me and how dangerous I am.
[01:18:43.064 --> 01:18:49.750]  So literally the global rulers are in their councils saying we've got to stop Alex Jones, but how do we do it?
[01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:50.430]  Do we poison him?
[01:18:50.430 --> 01:18:51.351]  Do we kill him?
[01:18:51.351 --> 01:18:54.033]  No, let's destroy him and call him a racist when we never do that.
[01:18:54.033 --> 01:19:01.540]  Then they have their racist groups, their funding that's on record attacking me saying, you know, I'm a sellout because I'm not a racist as if being good as being a racist.
[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:08.884]  So, I mean, literally, ladies and gentlemen, you can do the same thing at your church, at your business, in your life.
[01:19:08.884 --> 01:19:09.804]  You can be the leaders.
[01:19:09.804 --> 01:19:12.425]  Black, white, Hispanic, old, young, male, female.
[01:19:12.425 --> 01:19:13.166]  It doesn't matter.
[01:19:13.166 --> 01:19:16.868]  A deciding crossroads is here upon us now.
[01:19:16.868 --> 01:19:27.053]  And if we want to stop this global financial meltdown, if we want to stop this orchestrated implosion, if we want to stop this tyranny, we have to stand together as a free society and realize that we do have power.
[01:19:27.893 --> 01:19:37.957]  Yeah, actually to the viral nature of it, we had Patrice O'Neill on about a year ago and the reason we found out about that, a listener, he was on the Opie and Anthony Show explaining the Obama deception to him.
[01:19:37.957 --> 01:19:39.438]  So it's just a message getting out.
[01:19:39.438 --> 01:19:43.899]  We have pop culture magazines in England coming to us, newspapers in Greece daily.
[01:19:43.899 --> 01:19:48.321]  We have a ton of other media asking if they have contact, if we have contact for our guests.
[01:19:48.321 --> 01:19:50.422]  They just, everybody wants this information.
[01:19:50.422 --> 01:19:54.864]  And I just, I'm turning down the History Channel for a big interview because literally they don't matter now.
[01:19:55.604 --> 01:19:58.106]  It's this information that matters, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:19:58.106 --> 01:19:59.167]  We're having victories.
[01:19:59.167 --> 01:20:00.168]  Good job, Terren.
[01:20:00.168 --> 01:20:02.350]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:02.350 --> 01:20:05.713]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:20:05.713 --> 01:20:09.636]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[01:20:09.636 --> 01:20:13.360]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:18.284]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water.
[01:20:18.504 --> 01:20:18.764]  I think?
[01:20:34.657 --> 01:20:39.778]  You'll receive a shower filter, a fluoride filter, or two sport Berkey bottles absolutely free.

[01:22:01.491 --> 01:22:11.517]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[01:22:11.517 --> 01:22:17.960]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:26.805]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[01:22:27.185 --> 01:22:36.373]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[01:22:36.373 --> 01:22:41.377]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[01:22:41.377 --> 01:22:42.778]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:42.778 --> 01:22:45.280]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.

[01:22:50.225 --> 01:22:53.348]  Your natural organic herbal formula for heart health is Heart and Body Extract.
[01:22:53.348 --> 01:22:55.470]  My name is Pam and I'm 68 years old and I live in Vermont.
[01:23:09.508 --> 01:23:14.231]  In the spring of 2003, I started to have problems with my heart.
[01:23:14.231 --> 01:23:16.313]  It felt like my heart was pounding.
[01:23:16.313 --> 01:23:18.054]  Made me feel breathless.
[01:23:18.054 --> 01:23:22.477]  I tried many, many different things to try to get some help for myself.
[01:23:22.477 --> 01:23:23.558]  Nothing did anything.
[01:23:23.558 --> 01:23:27.540]  Heart and Body Extract is very powerful, very effective, and works quickly.
[01:23:27.540 --> 01:23:31.683]  I saw one of Sharon's ads and ordered Heart and Body Extract.
[01:23:31.683 --> 01:23:34.305]  I noticed a difference quickly, within days.
[01:23:34.745 --> 01:23:39.767]  The episodes became less frequent and by a month I completely vanished.
[01:23:39.767 --> 01:23:42.568]  Usually you find a 30-day or 60-day guarantee.
[01:23:42.568 --> 01:23:47.370]  Heart and Body Extract comes with a lifetime 100% ironclad money-back guarantee.

[01:23:49.091 --> 01:23:49.271]  Call 866-295-5305.
[01:23:49.271 --> 01:23:50.691]  866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[01:24:07.262 --> 01:24:16.791]  My friends, the giant effect we've had and the exponential growth curve of our power to reach people is a great boon for liberty, but it's also a danger.
[01:24:16.791 --> 01:24:23.678]  Because if they can successfully destroy Alex Jones, they can attempt to wound the idea of the resistance.
[01:24:23.678 --> 01:24:24.679]  And I've always attempted
[01:24:25.279 --> 01:24:29.543]  To not be in this leadership position, but there's no denying it, and it's exponential.
[01:24:29.543 --> 01:24:34.807]  And I pray every day that God strengthens me and helps me be somewhat worthy of this position.
[01:24:34.807 --> 01:24:43.674]  But all of us are in this special position in this time and space, in the time-space continuum, of having a serious choice, liberty or tyranny.
[01:24:43.674 --> 01:24:51.040]  I was talking to Richard Reeves, another great activist that I've known for years, who's just gone on, with my encouragement and others, to just do amazing things.
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:52.942]  He's been to Bilderberg with us to cover it.
[01:24:53.922 --> 01:24:54.202]  I think?
[01:25:12.409 --> 01:25:13.289]  This is happening.
[01:25:13.289 --> 01:25:16.030]  So I want to get him here because he's an expert on the realignment that's happening.
[01:25:16.030 --> 01:25:18.191]  He saw it a year and a half ago as I did.
[01:25:18.191 --> 01:25:21.633]  And also on the toll roads because they're going ahead with the NAFTA superhighways.
[01:25:21.633 --> 01:25:23.554]  They've just changed the name.
[01:25:23.554 --> 01:25:27.595]  These are international zones to raise taxes for these international groups.
[01:25:27.595 --> 01:25:29.116]  So are the carbon taxes.
[01:25:29.116 --> 01:25:31.057]  So we're going to discuss that after the break.
[01:25:31.057 --> 01:25:34.158]  But Richard also brought to my attention a chilling Obama quote.
[01:25:34.158 --> 01:25:35.298]  He said, I'm sure you know about it.
[01:25:35.298 --> 01:25:36.779]  It came out a week ago or so.
[01:25:36.779 --> 01:25:38.159]  And I said, no, I'm not aware of it.
[01:25:38.159 --> 01:25:39.280]  See, that's why you the listeners.
[01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:41.261]  And the other activists are so important.
[01:25:41.261 --> 01:25:44.323]  None of us can know all of this or even half of it.
[01:25:44.323 --> 01:25:55.249]  But Richard, you've heard me on the show just to say, and I know I'm right, 100% chance they're going to fully implode things to a road warrior level, many times worse than the Great Depression.
[01:25:55.249 --> 01:25:59.691]  They think because we're dependent and they've gotten us dependent that we'll have to submit to them.
[01:25:59.691 --> 01:26:04.714]  They're announcing police aren't going to respond to robberies, people being poisoned, people being attacked.
[01:26:05.174 --> 01:26:07.135]  That's happening all over the country.
[01:26:07.135 --> 01:26:10.976]  They're training us that your taxes are going up, but we're going to let lawlessness take over.
[01:26:10.976 --> 01:26:11.916]  The border's lawless.
[01:26:11.916 --> 01:26:14.957]  Obama says he wants it lawless to Senator Kyle.
[01:26:14.957 --> 01:26:16.698]  So people will capitulate.
[01:26:16.698 --> 01:26:19.118]  I mean, but the good news is they're in trouble.
[01:26:19.118 --> 01:26:20.479]  People say, well, what's the solution?
[01:26:20.479 --> 01:26:21.439]  It's screaming bloody murder.
[01:26:21.439 --> 01:26:23.360]  It's saying, we know you're doing this deliberately.
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:24.520]  You're criminals.
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:27.501]  And we know the Republican leadership is involved in it as well.
[01:26:28.261 --> 01:26:32.306]  And just identifying them as the treacherous, larcenous traitors they are.
[01:26:32.306 --> 01:26:42.357]  Richard Reeves, give us the state of the union and the state of the globe from your research, because you're a radio talk show host, author, researcher, activist, one of the key people fighting the trans-Texas corridor.
[01:26:42.357 --> 01:26:46.081]  Well, Alex, thank you for having me on, and I tell you, we are in a definite
[01:26:47.242 --> 01:26:48.663]  At the edge of a cliff right here.
[01:26:48.663 --> 01:26:51.605]  I think you're right, absolutely, because they do see the awakening.
[01:26:51.605 --> 01:26:55.588]  I think we had Brzezinski talk about that the global awakening is going on.
[01:26:55.588 --> 01:27:04.293]  We had a Henry Kissinger quote come out that if the euro collapses over in the European Union, if that comes apart, the New World Order could be lost right now.
[01:27:04.293 --> 01:27:06.095]  But I don't think they're ready to give it up that quick.
[01:27:06.095 --> 01:27:10.117]  They are definitely ready to potentially pull the plug on us here.
[01:27:10.117 --> 01:27:12.179]  And I think one thing we could discuss through the next
[01:27:12.659 --> 01:27:12.839]  I don't
[01:27:37.012 --> 01:27:43.539]  No, that's what the IMF World Bank plan says they did to third world countries and they admit they're doing it to Europe and the US and England and Australia.
[01:27:43.539 --> 01:27:46.102]  Right, so that's what I'm real concerned about is that lame duck session.
[01:27:46.102 --> 01:27:49.265]  But nonetheless, we've got to do what we've got to do.
[01:27:49.265 --> 01:27:53.429]  Earlier you were talking about how that you were getting all the media coverage and the
[01:27:54.230 --> 01:27:58.013]  Talk about Alex Jones, Infowars, and the Patriot Movement, Tea Party, etc.
[01:27:58.013 --> 01:27:59.314]  was just blowing up.
[01:27:59.314 --> 01:28:12.823]  Well, that's one thing that I've noticed that years ago, back in the late 90s, early 2000, stories that were discussed here in the alternative media sometimes took the mainstream media 2, 3, 4, 5 years.
[01:28:12.823 --> 01:28:15.906]  In some cases, they didn't talk about a story that we talked about in maybe 10 years.
[01:28:15.906 --> 01:28:17.427]  Now they admit on Fox and CNN?
[01:28:17.967 --> 01:28:20.408]  Prozac does cause brain cancer and heart attacks.
[01:28:20.408 --> 01:28:25.551]  They admit, OK, it is causing miscarriages and for babies to be underweight and deformed.
[01:28:25.551 --> 01:28:28.773]  With the aspartame, which we knew back in the 70s, that was in the studies.
[01:28:28.773 --> 01:28:29.473]  I mean, exactly.
[01:28:29.473 --> 01:28:31.134]  It's just kind of out there now.
[01:28:31.134 --> 01:28:44.721]  Well, when it comes to the political realities of this world, the zeitgeist of it is flying right through this office, because it's like just yesterday on USA Today, yesterday, front page, full body scanners being protested against.
[01:28:44.721 --> 01:28:46.682]  Right there on the front page, they're talking about a story
[01:28:47.222 --> 01:28:53.027]  We're full body scanners at the airports that people are upset.
[01:28:53.027 --> 01:28:54.669]  I have another report here.
[01:28:54.669 --> 01:28:56.591]  Freeway speed cameras to be turned off.
[01:28:56.591 --> 01:29:00.274]  This is out of the Arizona newspaper, Arizona Republic.
[01:29:00.274 --> 01:29:04.338]  And it says because almost everyone refused to pay.
[01:29:04.338 --> 01:29:06.400]  Over 90% of people refused to pay the tickets.
[01:29:06.912 --> 01:29:07.532]  Right.
[01:29:07.532 --> 01:29:08.533]  So that's what it's going to take.
[01:29:08.533 --> 01:29:11.935]  It's going to take some civil disobedience at some point.
[01:29:11.935 --> 01:29:16.918]  But I think we still have, just by hanging by a thread, we've got the voting still hanging by a thread.
[01:29:16.918 --> 01:29:18.598]  We had the Rand Paul victory.
[01:29:18.598 --> 01:29:22.321]  We've got other victories that have happened in these primaries.
[01:29:22.321 --> 01:29:24.322]  Like you said, a lot of incumbents are going by the wayside.
[01:29:24.322 --> 01:29:25.522]  But we're in a fight for our lives.
[01:29:25.522 --> 01:29:32.326]  When we come back, let's go through that more, talk about the different scenarios in more detail because I love your political analysis.
[01:29:32.326 --> 01:29:34.767]  I think it's spot on and I want to get your take on that.
[01:29:34.767 --> 01:29:35.428]  Then we'll talk about
[01:29:36.008 --> 01:29:40.029]  Another key blood supply for this cancer is the global highways.
[01:29:40.029 --> 01:29:42.930]  They're doing this everywhere, and they're going to seize the water supplies.
[01:29:42.930 --> 01:29:43.730]  That's already happening.
[01:29:43.730 --> 01:29:44.811]  Double, tripling prices.
[01:29:44.811 --> 01:29:49.852]  I mean, this is a globalist rape gang hell-bent on bankrupting you and your family.
[01:29:49.852 --> 01:29:50.472]  We're going to defeat them.
[01:29:50.472 --> 01:29:52.433]  Stay with us.
[01:29:52.433 --> 01:29:53.833]  We're on the march.
[01:29:53.833 --> 01:29:56.354]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:56.354 --> 01:29:59.035]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:31:54.968 --> 01:31:55.408]  Thank you!
[01:32:01.155 --> 01:32:05.698]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:05.698 --> 01:32:06.618]  Number 1.
[01:32:06.618 --> 01:32:10.041]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:10.041 --> 01:32:10.901]  Number 2.
[01:32:10.901 --> 01:32:15.784]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:15.784 --> 01:32:16.545]  It's true.
[01:32:16.545 --> 01:32:21.408]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:21.408 --> 01:32:22.228]  Number 3.
[01:32:22.228 --> 01:32:25.811]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:25.811 --> 01:32:29.533]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:29.713 --> 01:32:30.514]  Number 4.
[01:32:30.514 --> 01:32:33.277]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:33.277 --> 01:32:36.961]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:36.961 --> 01:32:37.762]  Number 5.
[01:32:37.762 --> 01:32:41.907]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:41.907 --> 01:32:46.672]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:46.952 --> 01:32:51.118]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:51.118 --> 01:32:52.900]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:55.163]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:32:55.163 --> 01:32:57.507]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:33:01.357 --> 01:33:01.857]  You got it.
[01:33:01.857 --> 01:33:08.380]  This transmission is coming to you.
[01:33:08.380 --> 01:33:12.781]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:12.781 --> 01:33:18.363]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:33:20.965 --> 01:33:21.846]  We are back live.
[01:33:21.846 --> 01:33:23.247]  Richard Reeves in studio.
[01:33:23.247 --> 01:33:26.390]  Your call is coming up in the first half hour of the next hour.
[01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:32.496]  Then Larry Pratt, the head of Gunners of America with key intel on the enemy operations against the Second Amendment.
[01:33:32.496 --> 01:33:35.919]  There's been some good news but also some very bad news.
[01:33:35.919 --> 01:33:37.441]  We're talking about solutions.
[01:33:37.961 --> 01:33:40.283]  They're countering this globalist onslaught.
[01:33:40.283 --> 01:33:43.265]  That's how they take down old world and first world nations.
[01:33:43.265 --> 01:33:49.789]  They have a 100 point plus IMF, World Bank, Ex-Im Bank, OECD battle plan.
[01:33:49.789 --> 01:33:51.050]  These are public.
[01:33:51.050 --> 01:33:52.451]  They are doing it here.
[01:33:52.451 --> 01:33:54.433]  We know exactly what they're doing.
[01:33:54.433 --> 01:33:58.536]  But if we screw around and call the conspiracy theory, the media, oh, that's a conspiracy theory.
[01:33:58.536 --> 01:33:59.256]  Now they're not doing that.
[01:33:59.256 --> 01:34:03.759]  They go, OK, it is a world government and we are going to get rid of most of the police and let criminals rob you.
[01:34:04.780 --> 01:34:09.004]  You know, and we are going to put carbon taxes on you and raise your taxes, even though it'll destroy society.
[01:34:09.004 --> 01:34:10.565]  It's okay.
[01:34:10.565 --> 01:34:17.632]  We've got to stand up and say no, no, no, no, no, and act like leaders.
[01:34:17.632 --> 01:34:19.273]  We need to be confident.
[01:34:19.273 --> 01:34:22.916]  You know, the media is trying to say, like, I know this sounds like a conspiracy, but the government might be corrupt.
[01:34:22.916 --> 01:34:23.617]  I mean, come on.
[01:34:23.897 --> 01:34:25.658]  We're light years past that now.
[01:34:25.658 --> 01:34:27.440]  There's not time to screw around.
[01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:29.441]  You're living in the middle of a war.
[01:34:29.441 --> 01:34:31.543]  You're living in the middle of history right now.
[01:34:31.543 --> 01:34:38.708]  I'm not risking my life here, and I wasn't up here until 10 o'clock last night, working 14-hour day, busting my butt to play games.
[01:34:38.708 --> 01:34:41.510]  I know how real this is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:41.510 --> 01:34:46.794]  The real world's going on around you, and it's not about LeBron James or Lindsay Lohan or Mel Gibson.
[01:34:46.794 --> 01:34:50.137]  It's about how you're being enslaved and future generations are going to be enslaved.
[01:34:50.137 --> 01:34:51.077]  We don't stop this.
[01:34:51.077 --> 01:34:52.859]  And what's the biggest tool we've got in the fight?
[01:34:53.519 --> 01:34:55.640]  It's the documentary films.
[01:34:55.640 --> 01:35:03.041]  Rise of the Republic, Don't Tread on Me, How to Take the States Back at the Legislature and the County Level with the Sheriff and more.
[01:35:03.041 --> 01:35:08.062]  Invisible Empire, A New Order to Find, Exposing Who These Creatures Are and What Their Plan Is, our latest film.
[01:35:08.062 --> 01:35:11.943]  Endgame, Blueprint from Global Enslavement, almost three hour film detailing their entire agenda.
[01:35:11.943 --> 01:35:13.264]  You want a master's degree in it?
[01:35:13.264 --> 01:35:14.044]  Here it is.
[01:35:14.044 --> 01:35:18.845]  The Secret of Aj, What the Bankers Are Doing and Solutions to Defeat Them from the Makers of the Money Masters.
[01:35:19.165 --> 01:35:20.266]  The Obama deception.
[01:35:20.266 --> 01:35:22.087]  You want to shatter the left-right paradigm?
[01:35:22.087 --> 01:35:27.729]  Leftist and right-wingers will watch this, thinking it's a left-right paradigm film, and they'll have their conditioning broken.
[01:35:27.729 --> 01:35:32.212]  This film, conservatively, more than 25 to 30 million free downloads online.
[01:35:32.212 --> 01:35:34.993]  Buy the DVD and the highest quality, make copies, get it out to everyone.
[01:35:35.453 --> 01:35:37.534]  All available at InfoWars.com.
[01:35:37.534 --> 01:35:45.079]  Over 90% of the calls and on-the-street contacts and letters I get, and people I talk to that talk to others that have woken up, say it's from the films.
[01:35:45.079 --> 01:35:45.999]  The films.
[01:35:45.999 --> 01:35:46.880]  The films.
[01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:47.420]  The films.
[01:35:47.420 --> 01:35:50.202]  You may know all about this and know more than I and Richard Reeves combined.
[01:35:51.164 --> 01:35:52.145]  But does your neighbor?
[01:35:52.145 --> 01:35:52.946]  Does your family?
[01:35:52.946 --> 01:35:55.388]  They're ready to be awakened now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35:55.388 --> 01:35:56.689]  It's an info war.
[01:35:56.689 --> 01:35:57.709]  We want to keep it that way.
[01:35:57.709 --> 01:35:59.711]  The globalists want to make it a physical war.
[01:35:59.711 --> 01:36:01.613]  They're waging war on you with crime.
[01:36:01.613 --> 01:36:03.634]  They've always let the violent offenders go.
[01:36:03.634 --> 01:36:07.418]  Did you know somebody convicted of pot stays in longer than somebody convicted of robbery?
[01:36:08.098 --> 01:36:16.682]  You know, just like in Denver, the old 82-year-old veteran's getting robbed and they're trying to run him over in his yard so he shoots one of the illegal aliens and they let them go and charge him with murder.
[01:36:16.682 --> 01:36:20.744]  They want you to be a slave, the productive good people.
[01:36:20.744 --> 01:36:25.646]  You've got to reach out with these films and you also fund us when you do that with the PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[01:36:26.266 --> 01:36:33.927]  Where we simulcast the show and all the films in high quality, download them, burn them to disk, or the high quality DVDs at the online shopping carts at InfoWars.com.
[01:36:33.927 --> 01:36:39.568]  The t-shirts, all of it's about getting the word out, identifying as patriots, getting together.
[01:36:39.568 --> 01:36:40.108]  InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:36:40.108 --> 01:36:40.168]  888-253-3139.
[01:36:40.168 --> 01:36:41.169]  Or write to me, PO Box 19549, Austin, TX 78760.
[01:36:41.169 --> 01:36:42.649]  And I want to say this right now.
[01:36:42.649 --> 01:36:44.989]  I couldn't have done any of this in the last 15 years without you.
[01:36:55.951 --> 01:36:56.871]  Okay?
[01:36:56.871 --> 01:37:08.714]  And the globalists are going to try to confuse you on the web and get you to end fight, and that's what I love about Richard, he's immune to it, and distract off and make the fight about a fight with each other, instead of waking more people up.
[01:37:08.714 --> 01:37:14.335]  It's a life and death situation, and I want to commend all of you, because we are kicking the globalist hind end.
[01:37:14.335 --> 01:37:17.216]  But the problem is, the empire is now striking back.
[01:37:17.216 --> 01:37:22.797]  Richard, you've got the floor about the Kissinger quote, this Obama clip, the toll roads, everything.
[01:37:22.797 --> 01:37:23.537]  We're going to talk about
[01:37:23.997 --> 01:37:26.560]  Solutions, but also who the enemy is right now.
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:28.321]  What do you want to cover first?
[01:37:28.321 --> 01:37:30.564]  Well, first of all, I want to back up what you just said.
[01:37:30.564 --> 01:37:42.215]  Infowarrior is essential right now because if we have this economic collapse that you're talking about and that I think very well could be coming as well, we need to have our neighbors knowing who's really the culprit.
[01:37:42.595 --> 01:37:43.975]  You know, is it the middle class?
[01:37:43.975 --> 01:37:45.636]  Is it the guy down the street?
[01:37:45.636 --> 01:37:46.456]  No, it's not.
[01:37:46.456 --> 01:37:50.298]  It's the global elite that's doing this economic hit on the United States.
[01:37:50.298 --> 01:37:56.540]  So we need to Infowarrior times two times ten, whatever you're doing now, folks, amp it up.
[01:37:56.540 --> 01:38:05.602]  And the New World Order, they fund their operation out of thin air, paper, and ink, in zeros and ones in a computer that doesn't even exist in reality.
[01:38:05.602 --> 01:38:06.823]  That's how they fund their efforts.
[01:38:07.603 --> 01:38:11.567]  Folks, Alex needs help to fund these efforts and continue this going on.
[01:38:11.567 --> 01:38:17.252]  All right, I'll tell you, one of the quotes I thought you'd be really interested in with this oil well situation is Mikhail Gorbachev.
[01:38:17.252 --> 01:38:24.098]  The threat of environmental crisis will be the international disaster key that will unlock the new world order.
[01:38:24.098 --> 01:38:25.399]  So that plays right into this oil well.
[01:38:25.399 --> 01:38:27.180]  And that was published in newspapers.
[01:38:27.180 --> 01:38:32.605]  That was a 1988 quote, way back from 1988, supposedly December, UN General Assembly.
[01:38:32.605 --> 01:38:33.145]  Read that again.
[01:38:33.846 --> 01:38:45.573]  The threat, and I would say the implementation is probably the new word there, but the threat of environmental crisis will be the international disaster key that will unlock the New World Order.
[01:38:45.573 --> 01:38:50.095]  Maurice Strong quote, the environmental crisis is the cornerstone of the New World Order.
[01:38:50.095 --> 01:38:56.579]  So Al Gore, Maurice Strong, and Mikhail Gorbachev are the three musketeers of the environmental movement.
[01:38:56.579 --> 01:38:58.060]  So the New World Order is using that
[01:38:58.280 --> 01:38:58.881]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:39:19.901 --> 01:39:20.082]  I think?
[01:39:35.865 --> 01:39:37.666]  And before we play it, that's what I was saying earlier.
[01:39:37.666 --> 01:39:39.126]  They think we're domesticated.
[01:39:39.126 --> 01:39:48.149]  They've done the math and know that 90% of people, you know, aren't self-sufficient and are dependent one way or the other on the government, even if they don't work for the government.
[01:39:48.149 --> 01:39:51.730]  And so they've decided to bankrupt everything to say, you know, here's your choice.
[01:39:51.730 --> 01:39:53.050]  Fully submit to us.
[01:39:53.050 --> 01:39:54.530]  And we know what that means.
[01:39:54.530 --> 01:39:56.031]  So tell us about this clip we're about to see.
[01:39:56.531 --> 01:40:05.118]  Well, it's a G20 clip when Obama was there, and remember, he was encouraging other nations to keep up the stimulus, right?
[01:40:05.118 --> 01:40:08.181]  That means get more in debt to the bankers, but then he went further.
[01:40:08.181 --> 01:40:11.663]  He also said in a clip that no nation can be above any other.
[01:40:11.663 --> 01:40:14.266]  But that means lowering everyone with the bankers above us.
[01:40:14.266 --> 01:40:15.347]  So let's go ahead and play that clip.
[01:40:16.776 --> 01:40:27.109]  You know, one of the interesting things that's happened over the last 18 months as president is for some reason people keep on being surprised when I do what I said I was going to do.
[01:40:29.494 --> 01:40:36.657]  So, I say I'm going to reform our healthcare system and people think, well, gosh, that's not smart politics.
[01:40:36.657 --> 01:40:37.878]  Maybe we should hold off.
[01:40:37.878 --> 01:40:42.579]  Or I say we're going to move forward on don't ask, don't tell.
[01:40:42.579 --> 01:40:46.541]  Somehow people say, you know, well, why are you doing that?
[01:40:46.541 --> 01:40:49.482]  You know, I'm not sure that's good politics.
[01:40:49.482 --> 01:40:51.623]  I'm doing it because I said I was going to do it.
[01:40:51.623 --> 01:40:52.704]  And I think it's the right thing to do.
[01:40:54.484 --> 01:41:12.373]  And people should learn that lesson about me because next year when I start presenting some very difficult choices to the country, I hope some of these folks who are hollering about deficits and debt step up.
[01:41:12.373 --> 01:41:14.534]  Because I'm calling their bluff.
[01:41:14.534 --> 01:41:15.715]  And we'll see how
[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:28.708]  Much of that, how much of the political arguments they're making right now are real and how much of it was just politics.
[01:41:28.708 --> 01:41:29.148]  Alright?
[01:41:29.148 --> 01:41:29.949]  Thank you very much everybody.
[01:41:30.819 --> 01:41:32.700]  Boy, your take on that.
[01:41:32.700 --> 01:41:38.744]  Well, the headline on that on YouTube was Obama cryptically presents very difficult choices to the country next year.
[01:41:38.744 --> 01:41:40.725]  Well, that's when he first got elected.
[01:41:40.725 --> 01:41:43.327]  That's what Biden said.
[01:41:43.327 --> 01:41:45.728]  He said he's going to do some things that are going to make people hate us.
[01:41:45.728 --> 01:41:47.849]  And what they do is all the taxes are going to go to debt.
[01:41:47.849 --> 01:41:49.931]  They're going to get rid of the police, the welfare.
[01:41:49.931 --> 01:41:50.851]  They're going to slash it all.
[01:41:50.851 --> 01:41:52.352]  They're going to take pensions.
[01:41:52.352 --> 01:41:53.813]  And that's going to be the tough choice.
[01:41:53.813 --> 01:41:57.696]  And we see Republicans in The Washington Times saying, yes, we need to raise the retirement age to 70.
[01:41:58.576 --> 01:42:00.758]  And we need to start taking part of people's pension funds.
[01:42:00.758 --> 01:42:03.160]  So the bankers are going to get everything.
[01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:05.423]  They're going to have record profits like they've had the last two years.
[01:42:05.423 --> 01:42:06.744]  We're going to have nothing.
[01:42:06.744 --> 01:42:12.589]  Well, and we got to remember, he was addressing the G20 audience, people that they're basically in the know what's going on.
[01:42:12.589 --> 01:42:20.717]  So what I think he's anticipating is I think he's anticipating that in this general election in November, we're going to see a lot of incumbents get tossed out.
[01:42:21.718 --> 01:42:22.379]  I don't
[01:42:39.642 --> 01:42:54.110]  So, we've got a chance of seeing 20-30% new faces, potentially, in these upcoming... And most of these faces we know are bonafide patriots, and so the globalists are going to have trouble getting them under control, and it's exponential.
[01:42:54.110 --> 01:42:55.310]  Either way you slice it.
[01:42:55.310 --> 01:43:02.514]  I mean, did you hear me read from the Financial Times of London, top Clinton official, only a terror attack can save Obama?
[01:43:02.514 --> 01:43:06.156]  I mean, this story alone, five years ago, we talk about this for a month straight.
[01:43:06.156 --> 01:43:07.837]  These things are coming out on an hourly basis.
[01:43:08.317 --> 01:43:12.241]  Right, it's crazy how fast things are happening and how fast things are coming out.
[01:43:12.241 --> 01:43:17.547]  It's that quote that you say all the time that sometimes things happen in a year that happen in a hundred years that rapidly.
[01:43:17.547 --> 01:43:23.833]  But I think they're anticipating this big change in the House and Senate and so Obama is going to set the new
[01:43:24.594 --> 01:43:48.779]  Freshman up for a fall they're gonna come in and want to see fiscal responsibility implemented even though as we've your caller stated earlier In the last few days that the New World Order has Aladdin's lamp when it comes to creating money well the there's going to be a Desire for fiscal responsibility by the new freshman coming in and so he may let that happen to a more hideous degree than even they want and
[01:43:49.219 --> 01:43:51.201]  And then he's got somebody to point the finger at.
[01:44:05.285 --> 01:44:07.527]  You're allowed to administer poison to someone.
[01:44:07.527 --> 01:44:09.449]  We will not respond if someone's poisoned.
[01:44:09.449 --> 01:44:12.933]  Extortion, burglary, theft, embezzlement, grand theft.
[01:44:12.933 --> 01:44:15.115]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[01:44:15.115 --> 01:44:17.478]  Sabotaging power lines.
[01:44:17.478 --> 01:44:19.420]  I mean, this is insane.
[01:44:19.420 --> 01:44:22.964]  And we'll put that list on screen if you scroll down on an NBC article.
[01:44:22.964 --> 01:44:24.746]  This is his list.
[01:44:24.746 --> 01:44:27.829]  And that's a green light to the criminals to just go haywire.
[01:44:28.169 --> 01:44:28.990]  Right, right.
[01:44:28.990 --> 01:44:39.861]  And so that's what could happen is when we get this Mad Max scenario that you referred to earlier in the show, then that's going to put all of us in danger that are trying to, you know, maintain our house payment and drive our cars and go to work, etc.
[01:44:39.861 --> 01:44:43.826]  So it could be very... And they're going to offer the nude SDR and say,
[01:44:44.286 --> 01:44:49.169]  We'll jack the dollar up for you for a while, because under this SDR, the globals will fully run the dollar offshore now.
[01:44:49.169 --> 01:44:56.553]  It'll still be there, it's just they control it, and then now you'll have this SDR digital currency above that, and that's going to be their answer.
[01:44:56.553 --> 01:44:58.134]  Global government will fix this.
[01:44:58.134 --> 01:45:01.076]  And if we capitulate and roll over, they'll turn the economy back on for a few years.
[01:45:01.809 --> 01:45:03.990]  Well, but you know, we're going to have to go through this.
[01:45:03.990 --> 01:45:11.212]  That's what we've got to figure out is how to transition from this funny money Federal Reserve system to a real constitutional money system.
[01:45:11.212 --> 01:45:12.252]  Well, that's what they covered.
[01:45:12.252 --> 01:45:16.533]  That's a very ugly path, unfortunately, potentially, but that's the route we need to go.
[01:45:16.533 --> 01:45:21.515]  Now, I want to get into toll roads, but first some more, and we'll keep you five minutes the next hour if we need to.
[01:45:21.515 --> 01:45:25.156]  Richard, I know you have key info on the toll roads, so I wanted to get you here why I called you.
[01:45:25.156 --> 01:45:26.617]  But I want to go back to this.
[01:45:26.617 --> 01:45:27.537]  You read the IMF 100
[01:45:28.257 --> 01:45:28.477]  I think so.
[01:45:46.690 --> 01:45:46.930]  They just
[01:46:07.375 --> 01:46:11.817]  A hundred miles down the road, we push back 50, but still they've got 50 miles on us.
[01:46:11.817 --> 01:46:24.844]  So they know they have to make it super bad, so that then we fight back, get a little bit back, and think we won, when really our standard of living's been dropped by 20, 30, 40, 50 percent, which Maurice Strong and the UN and Al Gore say is their goal.
[01:46:24.844 --> 01:46:28.426]  The carbon tax is to destroy our industrial society, to make us dependent.
[01:46:28.426 --> 01:46:29.847]  China, India, and others are exempt.
[01:46:29.847 --> 01:46:31.488]  They're the new globalist command base.
[01:46:32.128 --> 01:46:41.932]  And so, they're going to wreck things so bad, so that, artificially, so that then when they turn things back on, it'll be a lot worse than it is now, but we'll think, oh my God, at least I've got food.
[01:46:41.932 --> 01:46:43.093]  At least the power's on.
[01:46:43.093 --> 01:46:44.453]  At least the water's flowing.
[01:46:44.453 --> 01:46:48.215]  And in the IMF World Bank plans, they say how they do it.
[01:46:48.215 --> 01:46:49.676]  I mean, they're doing that here.
[01:46:49.676 --> 01:46:51.397]  This is going to happen.
[01:46:51.397 --> 01:46:52.417]  And Richard, how do we stop it?
[01:46:52.657 --> 01:46:53.858]  I know they're engineering it.
[01:46:53.858 --> 01:46:55.039]  I know they're executing it.
[01:46:55.039 --> 01:46:55.799]  I have their playbook.
[01:46:55.799 --> 01:46:59.461]  I mean, it's not like I'm... I just realized now, they're really going for everything.
[01:46:59.461 --> 01:47:01.743]  They are going to hammer us into nothing.
[01:47:01.743 --> 01:47:04.144]  And I just want people to understand this.
[01:47:04.144 --> 01:47:10.188]  Well, one way to stop it, you did the plug earlier, is get those videos in the hands of as many people as possible.
[01:47:10.188 --> 01:47:13.230]  But the other things we can do is, we've still got elections coming up, primaries.
[01:47:13.230 --> 01:47:15.471]  Unfortunately, the Texas primaries already passed.
[01:47:15.471 --> 01:47:18.593]  We don't get another shot at firing incumbents until November.
[01:47:18.593 --> 01:47:19.514]  But in Oklahoma,
[01:47:20.114 --> 01:47:29.701]  In Oklahoma, we've got Randy Brogdon that has a good chance to run, to get into the Governor's primary in the Republican Party.
[01:47:29.701 --> 01:47:30.501]  Randy Brogdon.
[01:47:30.501 --> 01:47:32.823]  His website, RandyBrogdon.com.
[01:47:32.823 --> 01:47:41.389]  He might be worthy of an interview, I think, because he's a really good guy and he's polling around 40% in some of these mainstream monkey polls.
[01:47:41.389 --> 01:47:43.150]  So he's looking really good there.
[01:47:43.150 --> 01:47:48.954]  And plus, that creates a definite roadblock for the NAFTA corridor, for the trans-Texas corridor.
[01:47:49.915 --> 01:48:04.618]  Now there's 83 of these mega highways they want, but the key, and they admit for the whole country to merge into, is the Trans-Texas I-35 mega corridor, all the way into the north of Canada, all the way down to the port on the Pacific side in southern Mexico.
[01:48:04.918 --> 01:48:05.278]  Right.
[01:48:05.278 --> 01:48:09.821]  Laredo, Texas is the largest inland port in the United States.
[01:48:09.821 --> 01:48:10.601]  Laredo, Texas.
[01:48:10.601 --> 01:48:12.642]  Largest inland port, so absolutely.
[01:48:12.642 --> 01:48:18.886]  The Trans-Texas Corridor is a cornerstone, keystone piece of the NAFTA Corridor.
[01:48:18.886 --> 01:48:19.766]  It's their Death Star.
[01:48:19.766 --> 01:48:21.247]  We blow that politically.
[01:48:21.247 --> 01:48:24.149]  They're still going to have Star Destroyers, but we've blown their main fleet.
[01:48:24.369 --> 01:48:30.153]  Well, in November, we're going to get a chance to fire every incumbent in Texas that we possibly can.
[01:48:30.153 --> 01:48:35.036]  That's our best hope to make changes here politically in Texas up in November.
[01:48:35.036 --> 01:48:38.499]  And then up in Oklahoma, we've got Randy Brogdon, like I said.
[01:48:38.499 --> 01:48:39.219]  We've got R.J.
[01:48:39.219 --> 01:48:41.481]  Harris, another candidate for U.S.
[01:48:41.481 --> 01:48:43.622]  Rep that's got a good chance up there.
[01:48:43.622 --> 01:48:47.685]  And then we've got James Lane, Lane for OKSenate.com.
[01:48:47.685 --> 01:48:49.166]  James Lane is running for Oklahoma
[01:48:49.206 --> 01:48:50.826]  Yeah, there are hundreds of Patriot candidates.
[01:48:50.826 --> 01:48:53.987]  People should find them in their areas and break their backs supporting them.
[01:48:53.987 --> 01:49:02.029]  Now, let's tell people what the NAFTA highways do, and then a microcosm example, seizing MOPAC, which is admittedly illegal to put a toll road on an existing road.
[01:49:02.029 --> 01:49:04.170]  Every time they try it, we fight back.
[01:49:04.170 --> 01:49:05.630]  They retract it.
[01:49:05.630 --> 01:49:06.210]  They're back.
[01:49:06.210 --> 01:49:07.651]  Let's use MOPAC as a microcosm.
[01:49:08.231 --> 01:49:18.781]  Well, with MOPAC, see, the engineers that originally designed and built that figured that a lot more of that traffic on MOPAC would just be having downtown Austin as their destination.
[01:49:18.781 --> 01:49:27.668]  But as you well know, with I-35 being congested so badly so many hours of the day, then MOPAC has become a big through route through Austin now.
[01:49:27.668 --> 01:49:33.193]  And what they've done, though, is when they engineered that Lady Bird Lake Bridge, used to be Town Lake Bridge,
[01:49:33.894 --> 01:49:38.136]  When they engineered that, there's a lane that drops off on southbound and northbound side.
[01:49:38.136 --> 01:49:41.097]  So, there's a little bit of good news in this.
[01:49:41.097 --> 01:49:46.299]  The good news is they're going to add a third through lane, both north and southbound, on that bridge.
[01:49:46.299 --> 01:49:49.320]  I did call Kirk Watson's office last week after I heard you mention it.
[01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:50.881]  I can't believe it already says so.
[01:49:50.881 --> 01:49:52.162]  Well, I got this from Sandy.
[01:49:52.162 --> 01:49:52.862]  So, we'll see.
[01:49:52.862 --> 01:49:54.302]  Hopefully, they live up to it.
[01:49:54.302 --> 01:49:57.064]  And as I understand, they're already working and re-striping.
[01:49:57.064 --> 01:49:58.244]  Well, it should be a free road.
[01:49:58.244 --> 01:49:59.224]  We've already paid for it.
[01:49:59.224 --> 01:50:00.985]  It should be completely free road, three lanes.
[01:50:00.985 --> 01:50:03.006]  I mean, Kirk Watson is as crooked as a barrel of snakes.
[01:50:03.246 --> 01:50:05.609]  I tell you, I've got problems with Kirk Watson myself.
[01:50:05.609 --> 01:50:11.597]  But three lanes each way, all the way through, is what it's supposed to be when they get through re-striping.
[01:50:11.597 --> 01:50:16.464]  Now what they are planning on still doing is that fourth additional lane called the managed lane.
[01:50:16.464 --> 01:50:20.790]  That's going to be a toll road lane, and potentially that'll help Mopac marginally, but
[01:50:21.290 --> 01:50:27.913]  It'll create a bureaucracy that will continue to fight to keep I-35 in gridlock.
[01:50:27.913 --> 01:50:31.415]  I mean, here we are, we've got SH-130 that runs to our east.
[01:50:31.415 --> 01:50:33.796]  That's supposed to be our bypass here in Austin.
[01:50:33.796 --> 01:50:35.476]  Very underutilized.
[01:50:35.476 --> 01:50:37.817]  Millions of Austinite taxpayer dollars.
[01:50:37.817 --> 01:50:39.598]  The point is they hold us hostage.
[01:50:39.598 --> 01:50:44.120]  They won't build the roads and then they want to give it to foreign companies to loot us.
[01:50:44.120 --> 01:50:47.982]  And the way I've read the law, it's illegal to put toll roads on existing roads.
[01:50:48.542 --> 01:50:50.183]  Well, it is, but they parse those words.
[01:50:50.183 --> 01:50:52.484]  They'll say, well, we're going to add these new lanes.
[01:50:52.484 --> 01:50:55.046]  And so the existing road was the lanes that you had.
[01:50:55.046 --> 01:50:56.907]  And how are you going to exit off those?
[01:50:56.907 --> 01:50:58.728]  Well, that's I've yet to see exactly.
[01:50:58.728 --> 01:50:59.769]  It's impossible.
[01:50:59.769 --> 01:51:00.629]  It's impossible.
[01:51:00.629 --> 01:51:02.510]  The engineers have said so.
[01:51:02.510 --> 01:51:03.271]  Listen up, folks.
[01:51:03.271 --> 01:51:04.211]  This is important.
[01:51:04.211 --> 01:51:05.332]  Alex Jones here.
[01:51:05.332 --> 01:51:13.717]  Now you can get free shipping on the storable, easy to fix, delicious food from eFoodsDirect.com from July 4th through July 14th.
[01:51:13.717 --> 01:51:15.978]  We have looming evacuations in the southeast.
[01:51:16.278 --> 01:51:19.559]  Unemployment insurance running out and predictions of huge inflation.
[01:51:19.559 --> 01:51:21.920]  So we all need to get as much food as we can.
[01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:25.101]  Every one of you needs to buy as much storable food as possible.
[01:51:25.101 --> 01:51:30.303]  This is the perfect time to do just that with eFoodsDirect and take advantage of their free shipping special.
[01:51:30.303 --> 01:51:40.267]  When you order from eFoodsDirect.com from July 4th through July 14th, every dollar you spend will buy the food and eFoodsDirect will pay for the shipping in the continental United States.
[01:51:40.267 --> 01:51:42.488]  This is Alex Jones wishing you and your family
[01:51:42.768 --> 01:51:43.388]  We're good to go.
[01:52:02.415 --> 01:52:03.716]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:03.716 --> 01:52:09.320]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:09.320 --> 01:52:14.323]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:14.323 --> 01:52:19.367]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:52:19.907 --> 01:52:25.133]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:25.133 --> 01:52:32.241]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:32.241 --> 01:52:33.362]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:33.362 --> 01:52:39.729]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[01:53:07.506 --> 01:53:10.248]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?

[01:53:52.693 --> 01:53:53.054]  It works!
[01:54:15.662 --> 01:54:19.606]  Alright, we got Richard for a few more segments, and Larry Pratt's coming on for about 30.
[01:54:19.606 --> 01:54:29.855]  We'll take a few final calls towards the end of the next hour and get into some other news I haven't covered yet, but the establishment is going to promote lawlessness and the collapse to bring in their control.
[01:54:29.855 --> 01:54:37.161]  Getting back to toll roads, they always claim they're not going to put them in when resistance mounts, and then they come back later and do put them in.
[01:54:37.161 --> 01:54:40.484]  They've claimed over and over again no toll roads for MOPAC 183.
[01:54:40.484 --> 01:54:42.646]  It's the same story where there's Indiana, New Jersey,
[01:54:43.366 --> 01:54:48.547]  Over and over again, and we know that these are sweetheart deals with these foreign companies.
[01:54:48.547 --> 01:54:51.468]  I mean, this is not privatization, this is looting.
[01:54:51.468 --> 01:54:57.689]  But from your deep research on toll roads, I mean, look at how a year and a half ago they announced, okay, no trans-Texas corridor, we're going to cancel it.
[01:54:57.689 --> 01:55:03.291]  Then the same article in the AP said, we're just going to do it project by project and not call it that now.
[01:55:03.291 --> 01:55:08.712]  So they play these semantical games so we don't have a united front of enemies to go after.
[01:55:09.392 --> 01:55:17.974]  Well, Alex, you know, we really have slowed them down and we've damaged them, but they are definitely not gone, and they've got that Aladdin's Lamp of money that they want to keep pouring into this.
[01:55:17.974 --> 01:55:20.655]  The road builders are chomping at the bit for that money.
[01:55:20.655 --> 01:55:24.776]  So, they are going to continue, like you said, wanting to build these toll roads.
[01:55:24.776 --> 01:55:26.196]  They want to milk the U.S.
[01:55:26.196 --> 01:55:31.858]  people out of all the money they can get, and the ones that they can't milk on being on the toll roads, they're just going to put them on foot.
[01:55:32.398 --> 01:55:34.360]  That's part of their plan to reduce congestion.
[01:55:34.360 --> 01:55:42.447]  For the first time, we knew it was the policy in the last 20 years, but the head of the Department of Transportation said in the New York Times, what, a few months ago, that they're anti-car.
[01:55:42.447 --> 01:55:44.168]  But America's designed for cars.
[01:55:44.168 --> 01:55:46.370]  We're not compact Europe or Tokyo.
[01:55:46.370 --> 01:55:50.914]  I think Chicago and New York are probably the only cities that you can really get by without a car.
[01:55:50.914 --> 01:55:51.855]  Well, they know that, though.
[01:55:51.855 --> 01:55:54.317]  This is about bankrupting everybody.
[01:55:54.317 --> 01:55:54.757]  It is.
[01:55:54.757 --> 01:55:57.900]  I mean, the Pentagon designed the roads we've got in the 50s.
[01:55:57.900 --> 01:55:59.922]  They make us all dependent on it, then they try to take it away.
[01:56:00.402 --> 01:56:07.569]  Well, I've been in the transportation business over 30 years now, and I'm seeing more and more people be priced out of their cars, literally.
[01:56:07.569 --> 01:56:17.397]  When we had the price hike of $4 a gallon gas there briefly back in 2008, people were literally bailing out of their cars and riding taxis and buses because they could not afford the gas.
[01:56:17.397 --> 01:56:22.142]  So even as expensive as a taxi was, they were preferring that over driving their own vehicle.
[01:56:23.342 --> 01:56:27.665]  They've definitely got these plans to put people back on their feet.
[01:56:27.665 --> 01:56:36.630]  As a matter of fact, one guy jokingly said during a Central Texas meeting two or three years ago, he said that I'd like to see tolls on trails.
[01:56:37.489 --> 01:56:40.450]  You know, put tolls on trails and make people pay for walking.
[01:56:40.450 --> 01:56:45.592]  So that's the full intention that they have at some point if they can... Well, I mean, we always joke, what's the new tax?
[01:56:45.592 --> 01:56:46.633]  A tax on air?
[01:56:46.633 --> 01:56:49.694]  That's the New York Times headline, a tax on air.
[01:56:49.694 --> 01:56:50.654]  That's carbon dioxide.
[01:56:50.654 --> 01:56:51.434]  That's what Bill Gates said.
[01:56:51.434 --> 01:56:52.715]  We're going to tax you for breathing.
[01:56:53.564 --> 01:57:01.607]  Which, by the way, fellow Texans, on TexasTurf.org, Terri Hall's website, that she's always breaking down the toll road issues, got stories on there.
[01:57:01.607 --> 01:57:08.150]  There's a story on there right now how that highway lobby wants every kind of tax possible to build roads with.
[01:57:08.150 --> 01:57:17.854]  Now, they want toll roads, they want additional gasoline taxes, they want sales tax money, they want to dip into property tax money, they want to dip into every possible tax
[01:57:18.354 --> 01:57:20.235]  To help fund building these highways.
[01:57:20.235 --> 01:57:21.675]  So that's what we have to look at.
[01:57:21.675 --> 01:57:24.896]  And they always lie and say, because gas receipts are going to go down.
[01:57:24.896 --> 01:57:25.997]  They've gone up.
[01:57:25.997 --> 01:57:28.097]  They're lying about not having money.
[01:57:28.097 --> 01:57:34.780]  Well, you know, we might have had a small leveling off, like around 08, when we had the big $4 a gallon price tag.
[01:57:34.780 --> 01:57:36.560]  But basically, you're right.
[01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:43.543]  Even in down times, we still get more people still driving more cars, covering more miles, collecting more gasoline taxes.
[01:57:43.543 --> 01:57:47.544]  The state of Texas sends billions of dollars every year, and over the past decades,
[01:57:48.084 --> 01:57:49.285]  Multibillions of dollars?
[01:58:18.004 --> 01:58:18.404]  Taxicab.
[01:58:18.404 --> 01:58:19.704]  A taxicab?
[01:58:19.704 --> 01:58:23.846]  And notice, your taxes go up, but they say we gotta get rid of cops, they can't respond to burglary.
[01:58:23.846 --> 01:58:32.788]  Well, and the best example to look at is just type into search engine and look at Singapore roads and study Singapore toll roads and Singapore tolls.
[01:58:32.788 --> 01:58:37.109]  They've got 100% tax on just importing a car, if I remember right.
[01:58:37.109 --> 01:58:37.749]  Yeah, stay there.
[01:58:37.749 --> 01:58:39.469]  I mean, it's all a rip-off to the elites.
[01:58:39.469 --> 01:58:40.190]  They're robbing you.
[01:58:40.190 --> 01:58:40.670]  It's serfdom.

[01:59:57.435 --> 02:00:00.197]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:07.014 --> 02:00:08.316]  Big Brother.
[02:00:08.316 --> 02:00:10.098]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:10.098 --> 02:00:11.840]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:11.840 --> 02:00:13.442]  You want answers?
[02:00:13.442 --> 02:00:14.984]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.984 --> 02:00:19.189]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:19.189 --> 02:00:23.253]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.495 --> 02:00:28.060]  Richard Reeves, talk show host, great political activist from here in Austin, Texas.
[02:00:28.060 --> 02:00:29.262]  We've got five more minutes with him.
[02:00:29.262 --> 02:00:30.504]  Larry Pratt's coming up in about 30.
[02:00:30.504 --> 02:00:31.765]  Then I'll jam in some phone calls.
[02:00:31.765 --> 02:00:32.927]  Phones aren't open yet though, folks.
[02:00:32.927 --> 02:00:34.810]  I'm going to recap the top stories.
[02:00:34.810 --> 02:00:36.452]  I mean, I laid it out at the start of the broadcast.
[02:00:36.452 --> 02:00:40.538]  This is the most important time in our history that we're facing, and there's no doubt they're going to
[02:00:40.538 --> 02:00:40.858]  Thank you.
[02:00:58.288 --> 02:01:01.089]  Keep on raising our taxes any way possible.
[02:01:01.089 --> 02:01:08.573]  That's a big way they do it, and of course the media has been doing their job, and you've covered it so well about LeBron James and Lindsay Lohan and all this.
[02:01:08.573 --> 02:01:15.236]  So they just continue with their dumbing down at the education level and the public indoctrination centers, etc.
[02:01:15.236 --> 02:01:23.261]  I see them firing on all their weapons, pretty much, except, you know, hopefully not military weapons here, but you've got these environmental disasters.
[02:01:24.341 --> 02:01:27.564]  The question is now, at what point will they stop?
[02:01:27.564 --> 02:01:29.326]  At what point will they back off?
[02:01:29.326 --> 02:01:38.093]  And that's where we've got no choice but to go in as some of those analogies you've made in the past where like we're flying with X-Wing fighters into the Death Star.
[02:01:38.093 --> 02:01:43.358]  We've got to go in and we've got to fight them at every level that we can, politically, info warrior.
[02:01:43.358 --> 02:01:45.920]  Every little thing people do is so important because
[02:01:47.181 --> 02:01:47.901]  People get confused.
[02:01:47.901 --> 02:01:49.802]  They think, well, this is all about Obama getting re-elected.
[02:01:49.802 --> 02:01:51.422]  They could care less about him.
[02:01:51.422 --> 02:01:54.143]  He's not the power structure.
[02:01:54.143 --> 02:01:55.964]  And so they're more than happy to see him destroyed.
[02:01:55.964 --> 02:01:57.064]  They'll just move forward.
[02:01:57.064 --> 02:02:00.645]  We must put the blame on the criminal elite, the ruling class.
[02:02:00.645 --> 02:02:01.726]  Right, the ruling class.
[02:02:01.726 --> 02:02:03.326]  And how do we get to them?
[02:02:03.326 --> 02:02:04.086]  That's a good question.
[02:02:04.086 --> 02:02:09.088]  You've talked about trying to have indictments and have jury trials, etc.
[02:02:09.088 --> 02:02:10.908]  And that's definitely a way we need to go.
[02:02:10.908 --> 02:02:14.829]  But we need to have some political clout up there to initiate this.
[02:02:14.829 --> 02:02:15.990]  We've got to have judges.
[02:02:15.990 --> 02:02:16.630]  That's why they have the
[02:02:16.630 --> 02:02:21.131]  The Bilderberg group, Reuters, actually attacking me, it's very spooky.
[02:02:21.131 --> 02:02:27.894]  Because Ron, and Ron Paul, because we call for grand juries to indict them, we're actually pointing at the real power structure, not their puppets.
[02:02:27.894 --> 02:02:29.094]  And they don't like that.
[02:02:29.094 --> 02:02:32.055]  I mean, folks, this is death-defying what we're doing.
[02:02:32.555 --> 02:02:34.056]  Well, exactly.
[02:02:34.056 --> 02:02:36.477]  It's like we're on a high wire act is exactly right.
[02:02:36.477 --> 02:02:39.198]  We've got 500 feet up and no net.
[02:02:39.198 --> 02:02:40.118]  That's what we're going into.
[02:02:40.118 --> 02:02:43.439]  So that's why we need every tightrope walker we can get.
[02:02:43.439 --> 02:02:50.542]  And we especially need Alex Jones slash Ron Paul types in political office at every level, from dog catcher to senator to governor.
[02:02:50.542 --> 02:02:56.984]  So our people are everywhere, not even as a majority yet, but to watch and to expose corruption.
[02:02:56.984 --> 02:02:59.105]  Everything you do is life and death now at this point.
[02:02:59.605 --> 02:03:00.025]  It is.
[02:03:00.025 --> 02:03:04.126]  And I tell you, I'm thinking that we're swinging 10 to 20 percent of the vote.
[02:03:04.126 --> 02:03:11.069]  If we were organized enough to at least vote against incumbents in these elections, who knows how many people we could turn over.
[02:03:11.069 --> 02:03:20.091]  And in that big influx of new people, we're going to herd in quite a few patriot candidates at all these different levels of candidacy all over the country.
[02:03:20.091 --> 02:03:20.712]  And that's it.
[02:03:20.712 --> 02:03:23.152]  Like you said, there's so many that are running everywhere.
[02:03:23.152 --> 02:03:27.334]  And in 2012, Lord willing, that we get that far, we're going to have even more.
[02:03:28.374 --> 02:03:53.534]  I'm gonna make this final point then have you close out your statement and I appreciate you being here that I'd always seen it in the last four years it's really scary that the elite were all moving out of the US and they're even leaving Israel and even leaving England and moving to offshore armored islands I kind of saw it as a negative like they were gonna destroy us which they are but that's kind of good because it looks like they're just trying to steal everything and now they may realize they're gonna finally get kicked out
[02:03:54.534 --> 02:03:58.495]  Well, it's looking like they're going to have to self-eject because they may not have any choice.
[02:03:58.495 --> 02:04:04.978]  And like you said, many of them over the years, you said that many of them have already gotten their place in the Cayman Islands or wherever they go to.
[02:04:04.978 --> 02:04:09.059]  But the New World Order is definitely, it's global.
[02:04:09.059 --> 02:04:09.599]  It's global.
[02:04:09.599 --> 02:04:10.820]  So I don't know where they're going to go.
[02:04:10.820 --> 02:04:13.000]  I don't know where anybody's going to go because I've looked at it.
[02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.701]  I've looked at going to Central America and other countries.
[02:04:15.701 --> 02:04:17.122]  Well, in their New World Order system,
[02:04:17.702 --> 02:04:20.583]  It's like a spider tying up its prey.
[02:04:20.583 --> 02:04:22.024]  We are tied up in the red tape.
[02:04:22.024 --> 02:04:23.484]  They're all exempt from it.
[02:04:23.484 --> 02:04:30.047]  So that's why they only care about that global police power so they can rob nations one by one and kind of hopscotch around.
[02:04:30.047 --> 02:04:34.809]  Well, but these guys that only have the multi-millions or maybe in the low billions, they're just not big enough.
[02:04:34.809 --> 02:04:39.271]  So they're going to end up being the victim of the spider in the web as well at some point.
[02:04:39.271 --> 02:04:41.932]  So they might as well join the fight and help
[02:04:42.492 --> 02:04:44.094]  Fund what's going on here in the United States.
[02:04:44.094 --> 02:04:46.696]  The United States is definitely worth saving.
[02:04:46.696 --> 02:04:49.819]  And I'm not leaving anytime soon, that's for sure.
[02:04:49.819 --> 02:04:51.280]  No, we've got to stand here.
[02:04:51.280 --> 02:04:52.141]  We've got to make our stand.
[02:04:52.141 --> 02:04:53.422]  There's nowhere to run.
[02:04:53.422 --> 02:04:54.963]  Richard Reeves, always great having you in.
[02:04:54.963 --> 02:04:55.584]  Thanks a lot.
[02:04:55.584 --> 02:04:56.344]  Hey, thanks, Alex.
[02:04:56.344 --> 02:04:57.085]  I appreciate it.
[02:04:57.085 --> 02:04:59.427]  And we need some more leadership on the toll road fight.
[02:04:59.427 --> 02:05:01.529]  So come join in and get on.
[02:05:01.529 --> 02:05:03.350]  God bless you.

[02:06:03.629 --> 02:06:07.590]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:07.590 --> 02:06:16.452]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:06:16.452 --> 02:06:21.093]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:06:21.093 --> 02:06:31.915]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:06:32.535 --> 02:06:42.057]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:42.057 --> 02:06:47.479]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:06:47.479 --> 02:06:54.960]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:54.960 --> 02:06:57.721]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:07:01.627 --> 02:07:06.114]  Alex Jones here with urgent information concerning TrendsResearch.com.
[02:07:06.114 --> 02:07:13.585]  The Trends Journal distills the voluminous ongoing research of the Trends Research Institute into a concise, readily accessible form.
[02:07:13.585 --> 02:07:17.050]  By tracking 300 separately defined domestic and international trends,
[02:07:17.631 --> 02:07:22.153]  The Trends Journal establishes the connections that others fail to see or misinterpret.
[02:07:22.153 --> 02:07:30.015]  Gerald Salente's Trends Journal allows you to anticipate change, recognize the implications, and take protective strategies.
[02:07:30.015 --> 02:07:34.737]  Individual readers from every walk of life can put the Trends Journal Trends Forecast
[02:07:34.977 --> 02:07:36.578]  This information is too important to wait.
[02:08:07.014 --> 02:08:11.840]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:08:11.840 --> 02:08:13.422]  You want answers?
[02:08:13.422 --> 02:08:15.004]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:15.004 --> 02:08:19.169]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:19.169 --> 02:08:23.234]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:24.676 --> 02:08:32.964]  Well, the head of the only serious national organization that is no compromise on the Second Amendment, Larry Pratt, is with us until about 45 after.
[02:08:32.964 --> 02:08:37.208]  Then I'll jam in some phone calls and get into some of our top stories.
[02:08:37.208 --> 02:08:43.434]  But I want to talk about the Second Amendment situation with Larry Pratt from gunowners.org.
[02:08:43.434 --> 02:08:45.195]  But first, I wanted to throw this out there.
[02:08:45.996 --> 02:09:09.770]  Headlines suffer these criminals in Oakland don't call the cops and the police chief said Give us more funding and we won't respond to burglary theft embezzlement grand theft grand theft auto extortion embezzlement by an employee Poisoning administering poison to someone vandalism and it also says Sabotaging power lines.
[02:09:09.770 --> 02:09:10.431]  I mean, I don't know
[02:09:11.497 --> 02:09:17.840]  This is an alternate dimension or something, but that dovetails with a WKYC report and others we've been talking about.
[02:09:17.840 --> 02:09:22.022]  We're 112 deputies to 49 deputies in this Ohio County.
[02:09:22.022 --> 02:09:27.645]  But that deputy, that sheriff and judge, they're saying, buy guns, we can't protect you.
[02:09:27.645 --> 02:09:33.728]  And the 49 cops they're going to keep, one will be out there helping with calls, the rest are all bureaucracy and revenue generation.
[02:09:34.628 --> 02:09:34.828]  I don't
[02:09:54.480 --> 02:09:54.960]  I don't know.
[02:10:09.517 --> 02:10:13.320]  The Supreme Court has ruled, yes, you can have a gun if you jump through 100 hoops.
[02:10:13.320 --> 02:10:19.666]  Chicago's saying 500 bucks, five hours testing, psychological testing, can't have the gun outside your house.
[02:10:19.666 --> 02:10:21.327]  So I see this as a Supreme Court ruling.
[02:10:21.327 --> 02:10:23.249]  You've got a right to basically turn your guns in.
[02:10:23.249 --> 02:10:27.873]  But some say it has at least some effect because it says you can't outright ban them all.
[02:10:27.873 --> 02:10:28.893]  So we'll talk about all that.
[02:10:29.634 --> 02:10:30.654]  With Larry Pratt.
[02:10:30.654 --> 02:10:33.576]  But now we have CNN saying central banks start to abandon U.S.
[02:10:33.576 --> 02:10:34.236]  dollar.
[02:10:34.236 --> 02:10:37.457]  New York Times saying we're in a mega-depression.
[02:10:37.457 --> 02:10:38.978]  So now they're not lying about that.
[02:10:38.978 --> 02:10:41.238]  But their answer is more government.
[02:10:41.238 --> 02:10:43.799]  And then I have the Financial Times of London.
[02:10:43.799 --> 02:10:45.100]  Top Clinton official.
[02:10:45.100 --> 02:10:47.861]  Only a terror attack can save Obama.
[02:10:47.861 --> 02:10:53.823]  That's what former top Clinton advisor and Obama advisor Robert Shapiro said.
[02:10:53.823 --> 02:10:57.745]  The bottom line is that Americans don't believe in their President Obama's leadership.
[02:10:58.485 --> 02:10:59.045]  I don't know.
[02:11:11.252 --> 02:11:13.574]  I can't think of how he can do that.
[02:11:13.574 --> 02:11:14.675]  Amazing statement.
[02:11:14.675 --> 02:11:19.178]  So we're all in grave danger, ladies and gentlemen, right now.
[02:11:19.178 --> 02:11:20.599]  Larry Pratt, good to have you with us.
[02:11:20.599 --> 02:11:21.380]  And good to be with you.
[02:11:21.380 --> 02:11:22.320]  Thanks for having me.
[02:11:22.320 --> 02:11:24.542]  Let's take it piece by piece.
[02:11:24.542 --> 02:11:35.050]  What is your view on all over the country, police saying all the money has to go to bankers, we're bankrupt, and we're not going to protect you anymore, but you can't have a gun to protect yourself?
[02:11:35.543 --> 02:11:36.444]  Well, there's the rub.
[02:11:36.444 --> 02:11:40.748]  It's that can't have a gun anyway, even though we're not gonna do our job.
[02:11:40.748 --> 02:11:47.173]  What it should be is a wake-up call for all of us that we can't depend on the police.
[02:11:47.173 --> 02:11:57.542]  Even if they're doing everything they possibly can and want to do, they're just not going to be enough of them ever to have a cop on your shoulder.
[02:11:57.542 --> 02:12:02.847]  You know, the bumper sticker says, uh, I carry a gun because a cop is too heavy.
[02:12:03.527 --> 02:12:20.844]  And that's, I think, what comes out of all this, and we've got to push back on our employees who have the incredible view that they can tell us we can't have a gun to protect ourselves, and tell them that either they get it figured out right, or we're going to get somebody else in there.
[02:12:22.748 --> 02:12:35.194]  But, I mean, what about the message that we're not going to respond to burglary, home invasions, we're not going to respond to people being poisoned when someone poisons them, we're not going to respond to extortion, we're not going to respond to sabotage.
[02:12:35.194 --> 02:12:40.677]  I mean, this is a green light to go absolutely ape in Oakland, California.
[02:12:40.677 --> 02:12:51.362]  Well, you know, even in an anti-gun jurisdiction such as Chicago, it kind of surprised me, but the state several years ago, in fact, Obama voted on the wrong side of the measure,
[02:12:51.837 --> 02:13:12.962]  The state has a law that preempts what cities can do when someone uses a quote-unquote illegal gun, meaning it wasn't licensed, but of course you couldn't get a license for it anyway, and they use it in self-defense during a home invasion, the cities are prohibited from taking such an individual to court.
[02:13:12.962 --> 02:13:19.803]  And three times in the last couple of months, individuals have used handguns for self-defense
[02:13:20.473 --> 02:13:24.535]  In at least one case I know they shot and killed the invader.
[02:13:24.535 --> 02:13:29.578]  Nothing could be done by the city as bad as Daley wanted to bring charges.
[02:13:29.578 --> 02:13:30.578]  Couldn't do it.
[02:13:30.578 --> 02:13:39.683]  And so that's one way to legislatively handle the problem is just make it so that you can't touch us if we have done something in self-defense.
[02:13:39.683 --> 02:13:44.306]  And of course the better laws are those in Florida and Texas and some other states.
[02:13:44.306 --> 02:13:48.808]  The so-called castle doctrine where your home is your castle and they've taken the castle
[02:13:49.335 --> 02:13:49.495]  to me.
[02:14:08.212 --> 02:14:14.253]  Where the 82-year-old vet, the guy was robbing him, taking his trailer, trying to run over him, two illegal aliens.
[02:14:14.253 --> 02:14:16.474]  So he shot one of them, just wounding him.
[02:14:16.474 --> 02:14:19.634]  And then they let the illegals go, even though they pled guilty to stealing it.
[02:14:19.634 --> 02:14:22.295]  And they charged him with murder, not manslaughter.
[02:14:22.295 --> 02:14:27.356]  The old man with murder and life in prison because he defended himself.
[02:14:27.356 --> 02:14:29.076]  That sounds like something out of London.
[02:14:29.076 --> 02:14:30.097]  Yes, it does.
[02:14:30.097 --> 02:14:36.558]  And I know that there's that temptation for some prosecutors, even in a state like Texas, where
[02:14:37.322 --> 02:14:48.710]  Uh, situation a couple of years ago, the facts were a little different, but the thugs were running across from his neighbor's house across his property, and he blew him away.
[02:14:48.710 --> 02:14:55.735]  And, oh, they spent six months trying to figure out if they could get a bill from a grand jury on that.
[02:14:55.735 --> 02:14:59.638]  And they finally dropped the charges because the Texas law is so clear.
[02:15:00.211 --> 02:15:05.896]  That you can use lethal force if you have any reason to think your life is in danger.
[02:15:05.896 --> 02:15:19.747]  When you've got a couple of thugs seeing you there with a shotgun, cutting across your property, and a cop actually happened to see it and said, yeah, that's what happened, then, you know, that's the way it ought to be!
[02:15:19.747 --> 02:15:28.214]  And we'd reduce the criminal population a lot more quickly that way than having to endure years and years of appeals and trials and
[02:15:29.375 --> 02:15:31.937]  Great cost and injustice, frankly.
[02:15:31.937 --> 02:15:34.218]  Justice delayed is justice denied.
[02:15:34.218 --> 02:15:38.421]  Well, Larry, we know in Chicago and New York City they have the highest crime rates.
[02:15:38.421 --> 02:15:39.622]  The criminals all move there.
[02:15:39.622 --> 02:15:40.843]  It's a war zone every day.
[02:15:40.843 --> 02:15:43.445]  We know that common sense, but we know the globalists.
[02:15:43.445 --> 02:15:47.787]  We know Sarah Brady's on record saying we can't have a socialist America until we disarm the American people.
[02:15:47.787 --> 02:15:53.231]  We know for UNIDIR at the UN they say the power monopoly of the state, everyone must be disarmed.
[02:15:53.231 --> 02:15:55.453]  State Senator Obama believed in total gun bans.
[02:15:55.453 --> 02:15:56.713]  The Attorney General believes in it.
[02:15:57.654 --> 02:16:09.019]  We know that they want our guns to enslave us, but the average moron who's scared of guns, who's domesticated, who was brought up by domesticated, gelded people, they're not really bad, they're just ignorant.
[02:16:09.019 --> 02:16:16.922]  And it's just like people who wouldn't let folks hunt wolves or coyotes or wildcats or alligators in places like major cities in Florida.
[02:16:16.922 --> 02:16:20.583]  Now they're killing people, they're killing dogs, they're coming into yards.
[02:16:20.583 --> 02:16:24.365]  Now even the socialists are saying, yeah, somebody kill these alligators.
[02:16:24.745 --> 02:16:26.305]  Somebody killed these wildcats.
[02:16:26.305 --> 02:16:27.285]  They just killed my kid.
[02:16:27.285 --> 02:16:31.546]  You know, kids get killed every year because they like small prey in California.
[02:16:31.546 --> 02:16:33.267]  And now wildcats are all over L.A.
[02:16:33.267 --> 02:16:34.427]  trying to eat people.
[02:16:34.427 --> 02:16:35.567]  It's the same thing.
[02:16:35.567 --> 02:16:36.367]  They take the guns.
[02:16:36.367 --> 02:16:37.747]  Crime rates explode.
[02:16:37.747 --> 02:16:38.948]  And I've seen all the statistics.
[02:16:38.948 --> 02:16:42.868]  We're becoming a pro-gun nation again and rediscovering why it's so important.
[02:16:42.868 --> 02:16:52.610]  That's got to make these social globalists, these parasites angry that either way you cut it, we are shifting the momentum against them.
[02:16:53.010 --> 02:16:54.110]  You are correct.
[02:16:54.110 --> 02:17:05.415]  The polls have been over the, really the decades, showing a trend in the direction of understanding and wanting to apply the Second Amendment.
[02:17:05.415 --> 02:17:10.997]  And this is something that is totally inconsistent with the socialist worldview.
[02:17:10.997 --> 02:17:19.840]  They assume that they take charge of all at least important decisions in our lives, and for them an important decision evidently is
[02:17:20.373 --> 02:17:23.954]  What kind of food we might be allowed to eat.
[02:17:23.954 --> 02:17:30.456]  I don't have anything to say on behalf of junk food, but if somebody wants to do that, well, less power to them.
[02:17:30.456 --> 02:17:31.596]  It's okay with me.
[02:17:31.596 --> 02:17:34.437]  It's not my job to tell somebody what to eat.
[02:17:34.437 --> 02:17:37.058]  So that's the mindset of these people.
[02:17:37.058 --> 02:17:39.159]  They are control freaks.
[02:17:39.159 --> 02:17:50.062]  And getting back to your earlier point, they might, as you say, be upset about an extra wildcat in the neighborhood, but they don't have a problem so much with criminals
[02:17:50.543 --> 02:17:54.424]  Because criminals don't operate within their gated communities.
[02:17:54.424 --> 02:18:04.427]  They'll be safe almost all the time from the criminal element, and so it's an easy price for them to pay because they don't have to pay the price.
[02:18:04.427 --> 02:18:14.610]  The elite in England hasn't had to pay the price of the rising crime rate following the confiscation of virtually all the legal guns in the country.
[02:18:14.610 --> 02:18:19.951]  And even though crime has multiplied, literally multiplied, the rich and famous
[02:18:20.718 --> 02:18:22.160]  Don't ever get to see that.
[02:18:22.160 --> 02:18:26.186]  Maybe on television, but it's never something that affects them directly.
[02:18:26.186 --> 02:18:27.628]  So it's no big deal.
[02:18:27.628 --> 02:18:32.434]  And they use our tax money to pay for government and private security.
[02:18:32.434 --> 02:18:34.557]  Larry, what about the realignment?
[02:18:35.458 --> 02:18:39.760]  Pro-establishment Republicans and Democrats are losing every major primary.
[02:18:39.760 --> 02:18:43.762]  This is a major political realignment, not in parties, but for liberty.
[02:18:43.762 --> 02:18:45.043]  The system is panicking.
[02:18:45.043 --> 02:18:46.704]  Obama is in free fall.
[02:18:46.704 --> 02:18:51.886]  And some of his top advisors are saying, Obama needs another Oklahoma City or 9-11.
[02:18:51.886 --> 02:18:54.067]  That's pretty creepy to hear that.
[02:18:54.067 --> 02:18:56.408]  What do you think Obama and his people are going to do?
[02:18:56.408 --> 02:18:58.770]  They're not going to give up power easily.
[02:18:58.770 --> 02:19:03.572]  It is a worrisome thought, and columnists are beginning to speculate that something
[02:19:04.412 --> 02:19:30.628]  uh... like that might be in store obviously uh... he brought us a financial crisis thanks to years of incredibly stupid uh... legislation making banks uh... give loans to people in who couldn't pay them back uh... but uh... uh... it's pretty hard to get uh... financial crisis it's any worse than the one we're in so uh... indeed the question would be what's next uh... i think one thing we've seen a little foretaste
[02:19:31.392 --> 02:19:38.443]  Is election thuggery, particularly at the general election, chasing away Republican voters with the new Black Panther Party.
[02:19:39.670 --> 02:19:42.272]  Well, those are amazing tapes that are out there.
[02:19:42.272 --> 02:19:46.076]  Let's talk about Arizona when we get back, and treason.
[02:19:46.076 --> 02:19:49.279]  I mean, Obama, I don't know if you've seen the Senator Kyle video.
[02:19:49.279 --> 02:19:52.542]  You can play it, or if you haven't, but he was saying he met with Obama.
[02:19:52.542 --> 02:19:54.223]  Obama said, I want the crisis down there.
[02:19:54.223 --> 02:19:55.685]  I want to get amnesty passed.
[02:19:55.685 --> 02:19:56.545]  I need that crisis.
[02:19:56.545 --> 02:19:59.428]  I mean, if that is an impeachable offense, I don't know what is.
[02:19:59.428 --> 02:20:00.369]  Larry Pratt's our guest.
[02:20:00.369 --> 02:20:00.949]  Stay with us.
[02:20:04.164 --> 02:20:06.164]  Remain in your houses.
[02:20:06.164 --> 02:20:11.926]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[02:20:11.926 --> 02:20:13.286]  Will they do it?
[02:20:13.286 --> 02:20:15.906]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[02:20:15.906 --> 02:20:22.368]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[02:20:22.368 --> 02:20:24.568]  Think it can't happen here?
[02:20:24.568 --> 02:20:26.589]  Executive Order 10990 locks down all highways.
[02:20:28.829 --> 02:20:33.713]  Executive Order 10995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[02:20:33.713 --> 02:20:38.637]  Executive Order 10998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[02:20:38.637 --> 02:20:44.382]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[02:20:44.382 --> 02:20:52.809]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to martiallawsurvival.com.

[02:22:02.239 --> 02:22:08.922]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:22:08.922 --> 02:22:17.045]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:22:17.045 --> 02:22:24.868]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:22:25.208 --> 02:22:30.294]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:22:30.294 --> 02:22:35.519]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:22:35.519 --> 02:22:39.864]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:22:39.864 --> 02:22:40.945]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[02:24:08.737 --> 02:24:12.999]  Larry Pratt with us for another 15 minutes, and I'm gonna open the phones up specifically
[02:24:15.194 --> 02:24:21.936]  On the headline, top Clinton official, only a terror attack can save Obama, with a bizarre quote.
[02:24:21.936 --> 02:24:36.320]  The bottom line here is that Americans don't believe in President Obama's leadership, said Shapiro, adding, he has to find some way between now and November of demonstrating that he is a leader who can command confidence and, short of a 9-11 event or Oklahoma City bombing,
[02:24:36.960 --> 02:24:39.321]  I can't think of how he could do that.
[02:24:39.321 --> 02:24:42.643]  Larry, I know I brought this up to you, but I really want to get your take on it specifically.
[02:24:42.643 --> 02:24:54.789]  That's out of the Financial Times of London, and the media is everywhere saying he's in free fall, whereas he has 40% supporting him, only 13% total have confidence.
[02:24:54.789 --> 02:24:57.931]  I mean, this guy looks like he may be the most unpopular president in history.
[02:24:58.451 --> 02:24:59.551]  He's working on it.
[02:24:59.551 --> 02:25:00.972]  I think he may get there.
[02:25:00.972 --> 02:25:03.853]  And I don't think he's incompetent.
[02:25:03.853 --> 02:25:15.618]  My take on this guy, and you and I have talked about it from even before he was elected, and I know I published a column before he was elected pointing out that he was a Marxist thug.
[02:25:15.618 --> 02:25:21.440]  Well, he, true to Saul Alinsky, the Rules for Radicals author who
[02:25:22.102 --> 02:25:30.577]  Explain how to tear down a system and have it implode on itself by just overloading it with too much welfare voter fraud all kinds of
[02:25:31.227 --> 02:25:33.828]  A financial crisis, you name it.
[02:25:33.828 --> 02:25:39.269]  The guy's working very hard to destroy, and he's working very fast at it.
[02:25:39.269 --> 02:25:39.969]  He's done a pretty good job.
[02:25:39.969 --> 02:25:40.489]  Well, they even admit that.
[02:25:40.489 --> 02:25:44.990]  I mean, if you're going to build the new socialist utopia, you've got to destroy the old house that was there.
[02:25:44.990 --> 02:25:46.631]  They want to destroy this country.
[02:25:46.631 --> 02:25:47.471]  Absolutely.
[02:25:47.471 --> 02:25:52.792]  And there's just no question, that's not incompetence down in the Gulf of Mexico.
[02:25:53.325 --> 02:25:57.091]  That is a desire to get all those blankety-blank Republican voters.
[02:25:57.091 --> 02:25:58.773]  Payback time, baby!
[02:25:58.773 --> 02:26:03.761]  Now we'll teach you that you should be dependent rather than independent, rather than producers.
[02:26:03.761 --> 02:26:06.105]  You should be drones so that we can control you.
[02:26:06.818 --> 02:26:07.879]  I agree with you.
[02:26:07.879 --> 02:26:14.347]  BP is the top globalist company that, with Al Gore and Enron, created the carbon tax.
[02:26:14.347 --> 02:26:15.368]  And Ron Paul agrees.
[02:26:15.368 --> 02:26:16.730]  He thinks it's very suspicious.
[02:26:16.730 --> 02:26:20.895]  And the way they're blocking any relief, I think they staged the whole thing.
[02:26:20.895 --> 02:26:26.681]  Well, if they didn't stage it, true to Rahm Emanuel, you never let a good crisis go to waste.
[02:26:26.681 --> 02:26:27.042]  But you know?
[02:26:27.988 --> 02:26:34.172]  Obama himself is in a crisis and we should resolve not to let that crisis go to waste.
[02:26:34.172 --> 02:26:36.774]  We should take care of business as we have been.
[02:26:36.774 --> 02:26:43.679]  You mentioned before we went to the break that at least most of the primaries have been going as we would hope they would.
[02:26:43.679 --> 02:26:49.303]  Sometimes we have too many conservatives dividing the vote and a liberal gets through like Dan Coats in Indiana.
[02:26:49.303 --> 02:26:53.966]  But by and large, the results have really been very satisfactory.
[02:26:55.090 --> 02:27:03.338]  If especially somebody like Jim DeMint is able to continue doing what he's doing, the Republican caucus in the Senate will have shifted to the right.
[02:27:03.338 --> 02:27:09.164]  Enough to tell Senator McConnell to stop playing patty cakes with the Democrats?
[02:27:09.164 --> 02:27:09.885]  I don't know.
[02:27:09.885 --> 02:27:16.892]  But it's certainly going to be more difficult for Senator McConnell because some of the people that are coming owe him nothing.
[02:27:17.412 --> 02:27:19.754]  Let's shift gears to Arizona.
[02:27:19.754 --> 02:27:21.015]  Many have called it treason.
[02:27:21.015 --> 02:27:24.318]  I think it fits the definition of high treason, not just treason.
[02:27:24.318 --> 02:27:30.003]  We now have that Senator Kyle testimony that he was told they love the crisis, the kidnappings, the murder, the death.
[02:27:30.003 --> 02:27:33.486]  80 plus miles denied to citizens into the state.
[02:27:34.707 --> 02:27:36.448]  Maybe they don't remember
[02:27:54.574 --> 02:28:02.679]  The intensity and almost literally the green smoke coming up from the Capitol Hill switchboards during the amnesty fight.
[02:28:02.679 --> 02:28:16.708]  That really got the country angry and there were groups out there encouraging people to make calls but there was also just a lot of spontaneous effort because people couldn't believe that we're going to allow
[02:28:17.646 --> 02:28:27.433]  Not only to continue such law-breaking as just walk into our country, la-dee-da, and then have no regard for the danger it puts people in.
[02:28:27.433 --> 02:28:34.297]  The rancher, just what, two, three, four months ago, that was murdered on his own land down on the border.
[02:28:34.297 --> 02:28:40.401]  And this was a guy known to have helped illegals that were in danger of dying of thirst.
[02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:45.164]  Uh, and yet, uh, no good deed goes unpunished.
[02:28:45.164 --> 02:28:48.748]  And that doesn't seem to bother Obama, because again, he lives in a gated community.
[02:28:48.748 --> 02:28:50.169]  It's called the White House.
[02:28:50.169 --> 02:28:53.033]  And, uh, you can't get close to him for anything.
[02:28:53.033 --> 02:28:54.735]  So he's, uh, no problem there.
[02:28:54.735 --> 02:28:56.817]  What, what, what border problem are you talking about?
[02:28:56.937 --> 02:28:59.258]  Well, the audacity of saying, well, we'll build the wall as soon as you agree to amnesty.
[02:29:17.103 --> 02:29:23.190]  Well, isn't that kind of like closing the barn door after the horse got out?
[02:29:23.190 --> 02:29:24.792]  Please!
[02:29:24.792 --> 02:29:27.895]  Well, that's like plugging a hole in the bottom of a ship after it's on the bottom.
[02:29:27.895 --> 02:29:28.076]  Yeah.
[02:29:29.733 --> 02:29:30.713]  Exactly right.
[02:29:30.713 --> 02:29:32.274]  They think we're that stupid.
[02:29:32.274 --> 02:29:33.195]  Well, we'll see.
[02:29:33.195 --> 02:29:46.741]  Larry, I want to, just briefly on the other side of the Malaya Yugoslavia, I know you're busy, get any other key battles around the country and worldwide for the right to keep and bear arms and where the victim disarmament movement is, how they're regrouping against free humanity.
[02:29:46.741 --> 02:29:48.802]  Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America is our guest.
[02:29:48.802 --> 02:29:49.922]  GunOwners.org.
[02:29:49.922 --> 02:29:52.703]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:29:52.703 --> 02:29:54.104]  We're on the march.
[02:29:54.104 --> 02:29:55.605]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:56.620 --> 02:29:59.309]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.130 --> 02:30:06.673]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:06.673 --> 02:30:07.593]  Number 1.
[02:30:07.593 --> 02:30:11.015]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:11.015 --> 02:30:11.875]  Number 2.
[02:30:11.875 --> 02:30:16.758]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:16.758 --> 02:30:17.499]  It's true.
[02:30:17.499 --> 02:30:22.381]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:22.381 --> 02:30:23.202]  Number 3.
[02:30:23.202 --> 02:30:26.784]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:26.784 --> 02:30:30.506]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:30.686 --> 02:30:31.486]  Number 4.
[02:30:31.486 --> 02:30:34.247]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:34.247 --> 02:30:37.929]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:37.929 --> 02:30:38.709]  Number 5.
[02:30:38.709 --> 02:30:42.871]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:30:42.871 --> 02:30:47.913]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:30:47.913 --> 02:30:52.094]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[02:31:02.011 --> 02:31:06.214]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:31:06.214 --> 02:31:12.619]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:31:12.619 --> 02:31:20.005]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:31:20.005 --> 02:31:24.869]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[02:31:33.540 --> 02:31:37.247]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[02:31:37.785 --> 02:31:44.550]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:31:44.550 --> 02:31:48.452]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:31:48.452 --> 02:31:54.536]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.

[02:33:15.353 --> 02:33:16.294]  We are back live.
[02:33:16.294 --> 02:33:17.595]  Larry Pratt is our guest.
[02:33:17.595 --> 02:33:30.528]  I'm going to open the phones up for quick comments on police all over the nation, governments holding people hostage saying we won't respond to your house being broken into, you name it, if you don't let us raise your taxes.
[02:33:30.528 --> 02:33:31.709]  That's basically what's going on.
[02:33:31.709 --> 02:33:34.151]  The globalists get you dependent, then they hold you.
[02:33:34.992 --> 02:33:38.633]  Hostage 1-800-259-9231.
[02:33:38.633 --> 02:33:41.654]  That's the subject I want to hear from you on.
[02:33:41.654 --> 02:33:49.956]  And Obama's advisors saying we need a terror attack so he can play the part of our big daddy and we can all worship this creature.
[02:33:49.956 --> 02:33:51.637]  We know Hitler staged terror attacks.
[02:33:51.637 --> 02:33:53.737]  We know that Stalin did it.
[02:33:53.737 --> 02:33:54.998]  We know they used crises.
[02:33:55.638 --> 02:33:57.979]  They don't like to let a good crisis go to waste.
[02:33:57.979 --> 02:33:58.339]  800-259-9231.
[02:33:58.339 --> 02:34:02.221]  Finishing up with Larry Pratt.
[02:34:02.221 --> 02:34:08.925]  Larry, again, the pendulum's starting to swing, but the globalists are so well-entrenched, people better intensify their actions.
[02:34:08.925 --> 02:34:18.110]  I want to get your view on that, and give us just a quick state of the Second Amendment here in the Republic, and some of the battles we're fighting.
[02:34:18.110 --> 02:34:18.470]  Okay.
[02:34:18.470 --> 02:34:21.851]  Well, the first one is Elena Kagan.
[02:34:21.851 --> 02:34:22.712]  It is not
[02:34:23.459 --> 02:34:30.964]  The most likely battle that we might win, but we have a chance to beat her.
[02:34:30.964 --> 02:34:44.713]  It is possible that we either can get enough backbone in the Republicans to launch a filibuster, they would have the votes to kill it right there, but it's also possible this woman has committed perjury.
[02:34:44.713 --> 02:34:48.416]  On two occasions when she was testifying under oath, she said she would
[02:34:48.803 --> 02:34:49.885]  I don't know.
[02:35:01.244 --> 02:35:03.564]  You better not even go for this gal.
[02:35:03.564 --> 02:35:05.505]  She's an enemy of freedom.
[02:35:05.505 --> 02:35:11.166]  And we're going to be hitting them, hopefully very soon, with some information on her.
[02:35:11.166 --> 02:35:20.047]  The actual lies that we've caught her in, and I think on two occasions we can actually make the case that she committed... Is there voting for confirmation next week on the 20th?
[02:35:20.047 --> 02:35:22.748]  I guess that's... That's what it's scheduled, yes.
[02:35:22.748 --> 02:35:30.249]  That's Tuesday, so... And I know you've done the research, but can you give us a little idea of what the particular perjury is?
[02:35:30.749 --> 02:35:32.871]  One, just give you one for example.
[02:35:32.871 --> 02:35:38.397]  She was testifying when, under oath, when she was up for Solicitor General, her present job.
[02:35:38.397 --> 02:35:43.262]  She was asked if she were going to pursue anything against DOMA, Defense of Marriage Act.
[02:35:43.735 --> 02:35:45.936]  And she said, nah, I'm not interested in going there.
[02:35:45.936 --> 02:35:52.498]  Almost the first thing she did when she got in was to turn around and start whacking away in the courts on that issue.
[02:35:52.498 --> 02:36:01.481]  So it seems to me that she's got herself in pretty deep and she didn't subject herself well to the
[02:36:01.974 --> 02:36:03.075]  Light of day.
[02:36:03.075 --> 02:36:17.644]  So I'm hopeful that we're going to push back hard enough that some of these guys are going to, maybe this is going to be Obama's Harriet Myers, the hapless nominee that Bush put forward that was finally slapped down.
[02:36:17.644 --> 02:36:30.833]  Another thing that's going and could be very encouraging for the elections, and it would re-energize discussion of socialized medicine, which the Republicans have not apparently wanted to do, and that's not a good thing.
[02:36:31.831 --> 02:36:40.136]  There's a discharge petition on Representative Steve King's measure that would just flat out repeal Obamacare.
[02:36:40.136 --> 02:36:46.720]  Now, it's not likely that Obama's going to sign it, but we need to get the members of Congress on record.
[02:36:46.720 --> 02:36:54.704]  And whether they even get to a vote, the fact is that while we work to the majority that must sign to force the vote, that signing
[02:36:55.200 --> 02:36:58.621]  list itself will be like a recorded vote.
[02:36:58.621 --> 02:37:10.483]  And one more thing that we can hold over them, you mean after all the things that came out after the passage of the bill about what a corrupt and rotten piece of socialism it is, you still wouldn't vote against it?
[02:37:10.483 --> 02:37:14.004]  So I think that's a pretty powerful issue.
[02:37:14.004 --> 02:37:23.046]  And secondly, I hope people will kind of keep an eye on our colleagues at the NRA, redstate.com, a very widely read blog
[02:37:23.867 --> 02:37:33.252]  Yesterday had a column by Eric Erickson on how the NRA actually tried to stop Senator Coburn's measure from succeeding.
[02:37:33.252 --> 02:37:36.574]  Happily, he withstood their efforts.
[02:37:36.574 --> 02:37:42.497]  And it is now law that the Reagan-era gun ban of guns in national parks
[02:37:43.230 --> 02:37:57.383]  Well, what about the Wall Street Journal a month ago ran the headline that the NRA sided with the House that's passed the bill to restrict political speech about how congressmen have voted?
[02:38:03.639 --> 02:38:06.820]  And actually, we may bottle that up in the Senate.
[02:38:06.820 --> 02:38:09.441]  That's another thing folks can go to gunowners.org for.
[02:38:09.441 --> 02:38:12.122]  We've got another alert that deals with that.
[02:38:12.122 --> 02:38:13.522]  I forget the name of that bill.
[02:38:13.522 --> 02:38:14.282]  What's it called?
[02:38:14.282 --> 02:38:15.363]  DISCLOSE.
[02:38:15.363 --> 02:38:20.825]  It's an acronym for something about the light of day on disclosure in politics.
[02:38:20.825 --> 02:38:21.985]  It's just a way of
[02:38:22.305 --> 02:38:39.193]  Harassing members of organizations, an attempt to get the names... They're now, the Federal Elections Commission, I had Ron Paul on a week and a half ago, they're now investigating Campaign for Liberty with a fine-tooth comb, telling them, you're not allowed to send out emails on how people voted.
[02:38:39.193 --> 02:38:43.535]  I mean, in America, we can't say how somebody voted?
[02:38:43.535 --> 02:38:51.919]  They're mad because he had a way of starting up an organization from his presidential drive and Campaign for Liberty,
[02:38:52.375 --> 02:38:56.518]  Is going great guns, and that has them very upset.
[02:38:56.518 --> 02:39:01.481]  It's a new kid on the block, and I guess they'd like to strangle it in its crib, but that ain't gonna happen.
[02:39:01.481 --> 02:39:11.127]  Well, as you know, it's a key catalyst to get more patriot, pro-Constitution candidates in, when every time they run, they win, if they've got backing.
[02:39:11.127 --> 02:39:11.787]  Absolutely.
[02:39:11.787 --> 02:39:17.350]  It's been a very successful year for that segment of the political spectrum.
[02:39:17.350 --> 02:39:19.372]  They've been doing an excellent job.
[02:39:19.372 --> 02:39:21.573]  The Tea Party is reflective of
[02:39:21.980 --> 02:39:24.642]  That work as well, and it's brought in additional people.
[02:39:24.642 --> 02:39:30.427]  And the fact that there are lots of new people involved tells you something.
[02:39:30.427 --> 02:39:48.782]  When in a very liberal district out in California, Representative Harmon, Brad Sherman, when the people at a town hall meeting erupted in disbelief and catcalls when he said he wasn't aware of the thuggery of the new Black Panther Party during the elections,
[02:39:49.392 --> 02:39:54.917]  Up in Philadelphia in 2008, the people just shut the meeting down.
[02:39:54.917 --> 02:39:58.540]  And the guy said, well, I didn't see anything about it in the media that I read.
[02:39:58.540 --> 02:40:00.502]  Well, that's just the problem, pal.
[02:40:00.502 --> 02:40:02.563]  You're in your own dream world.
[02:40:02.563 --> 02:40:05.706]  And the rest of us aren't in that socialist cocoon.
[02:40:05.706 --> 02:40:06.347]  Well, that's right.
[02:40:06.347 --> 02:40:08.068]  Less and less people watch it.
[02:40:08.068 --> 02:40:10.210]  CNN, MSNBC are in freefall.
[02:40:10.210 --> 02:40:11.791]  And I'm not exaggerating.
[02:40:11.791 --> 02:40:14.454]  I'm not one of the, you know, even top
[02:40:15.390 --> 02:40:24.153]  Well, some ways you look at number one internet show, top 15 conservatively at talk radio, but still that's not that big for being on stations.
[02:40:24.153 --> 02:40:38.399]  But the issue is, I can look at our affiliated stations and just the stations that subscribe to Arbitron, our numbers, I have more listeners and viewers, conservatively, in my three hours than CNN's top rated show.
[02:40:38.399 --> 02:40:42.941]  There's still the prestige of Larry King having a million viewers, but I mean, I have
[02:40:43.601 --> 02:40:46.322]  Close to 300,000 podcast listeners a day.
[02:40:46.322 --> 02:40:51.582]  Our affiliates now have over 400,000 listeners per every 15 minutes.
[02:40:51.582 --> 02:40:56.303]  That's the big, you know, CUME number that the ad agencies have.
[02:40:56.303 --> 02:41:04.825]  And, I mean, if I've got over a million people every day, more than 2 million total a week, because, you know, you have regulars that come in, but then the stragglers, it's about 2 million a week and growing.
[02:41:04.825 --> 02:41:06.285]  I mean, Larry King Live is a joke.
[02:41:06.285 --> 02:41:08.085]  I mean, that's why he's retiring.
[02:41:08.085 --> 02:41:09.706]  I mean, it's over for these people.
[02:41:09.706 --> 02:41:10.986]  No one is listening to them.
[02:41:11.246 --> 02:41:12.127]  Correct.
[02:41:12.127 --> 02:41:14.210]  Their numbers are in free fall.
[02:41:14.210 --> 02:41:25.243]  Every time I see something about that, it's clear that people are either not getting any information at all, but more likely, they're going to all of these alternate sources that are available.
[02:41:25.243 --> 02:41:27.545]  I don't get a daily paper delivered to my house anymore.
[02:41:27.545 --> 02:41:27.986]  Why should I?
[02:41:30.887 --> 02:41:36.471]  You have so many ways of getting information, and the information that I'm looking for wouldn't have been in the Daily Telegraph.
[02:41:36.471 --> 02:41:38.172]  Well, that brings me to my next-to-last question.
[02:41:38.172 --> 02:41:41.354]  Here are the two questions quickly, because I know you're busy.
[02:41:41.354 --> 02:41:43.255]  Number one, Chicago.
[02:41:43.255 --> 02:41:47.878]  How do you analyze that ruling and the hoops that Chicago wants people to jump through?
[02:41:47.878 --> 02:41:50.319]  Do you think that'll be challenged?
[02:41:50.319 --> 02:41:51.380]  Quick statement on that, sir.
[02:41:51.380 --> 02:41:55.602]  And then finally, they're openly announcing they want to censor the web and talk radio now.
[02:41:55.602 --> 02:41:57.864]  That's just proving to people what thugs they are.
[02:41:57.864 --> 02:41:58.264]  Exactly.
[02:41:58.404 --> 02:42:08.586]  Well, I think in the case of Chicago, they're going to get away with this until they are challenged, and there's the possibility that if the second Heller case, which is now before the D.C.
[02:42:08.586 --> 02:42:20.828]  Court of Appeals, is successful, and if it's lawyered in the proper way, so that it's a broad enough suit and a broad enough decision, it would not only bring down the D.C.
[02:42:20.828 --> 02:42:27.889]  licensing law, which I think is quite likely, based on what Judge Scalia said in the first Heller decision,
[02:42:28.602 --> 02:42:39.291]  But it could, then, if it's broad enough, instead of just a narrow thing like these first two Heller and McDonnell decisions have been, it could bring down Chicago as well.
[02:42:40.384 --> 02:42:44.245]  I'm sorry, the second point that you wanted addressed?
[02:42:44.245 --> 02:42:48.806]  No, just finally, the open announcements that they want to tax and control the Internet.
[02:42:48.806 --> 02:42:50.366]  I think that you're correct.
[02:42:50.366 --> 02:42:55.987]  That has shown people that if they can't win the argument, they're going to try to put a gag in our mouth.
[02:42:55.987 --> 02:42:58.728]  That's what McCain-Feingold was all about.
[02:42:58.728 --> 02:43:01.248]  That's what the Disclose Act is all about.
[02:43:01.248 --> 02:43:06.470]  And if they can come up with this, and they're already starting in a few markets to set up these Soviets.
[02:43:06.470 --> 02:43:08.330]  They call them stakeholder councils.
[02:43:08.683 --> 02:43:26.313]  But the word council is Soviet in Russian and these Soviets would be designed to file a liberal complaint against any station that's carrying your show or any of the other talkers and make it so that
[02:43:26.704 --> 02:43:40.471]  They have so much in a file at the time for renewal that they might not get their renewal, so stations knowing that would then start figuring out, well, what kind of pablum can I offset so I don't have the expense of fighting these fights?
[02:43:40.471 --> 02:43:44.654]  And instead of stations buckling to that, they need to get more aggressive and defend the First Amendment.
[02:43:44.654 --> 02:43:48.235]  You cannot pacify these hooligans.
[02:43:48.235 --> 02:43:49.976]  I mean, this is real authoritarianism.
[02:43:49.976 --> 02:43:51.157]  These people aren't playing games.
[02:43:51.317 --> 02:43:51.697]  Correct.
[02:43:51.697 --> 02:43:54.559]  That is exactly the right thing to do.
[02:43:54.559 --> 02:44:02.564]  We need to make sure that if they want to do thuggery at the polls, it'll be dealt with in a proper fashion.
[02:44:02.564 --> 02:44:07.187]  We've got to be organized for that, and it goes back to the point you made earlier.
[02:44:07.187 --> 02:44:12.471]  We've got to double down and intensify our efforts, and we've all got to get involved as poll watchers and
[02:44:13.124 --> 02:44:24.678]  Uh, people that are right there on the scene so when stuff starts to happen, you know, in Chicago, the Republican poll watcher is usually a Democrat anyway, so he's not going to pick up his cell phone and call the cops.
[02:44:24.678 --> 02:44:26.941]  We've got to be there to do those kinds of things.
[02:44:27.711 --> 02:44:28.512]  Absolutely.
[02:44:28.512 --> 02:44:33.034]  And instead of having one video of people intimidating voters, we'll have hundreds as we know what's going on.
[02:44:33.034 --> 02:44:35.776]  Larry Pratt, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:44:35.776 --> 02:44:36.636]  Been great to be with you.
[02:44:36.636 --> 02:44:37.397]  Thanks for having me.
[02:44:37.397 --> 02:44:38.157]  Always wonderful.
[02:44:38.157 --> 02:44:39.658]  GunOwners.org, folks.
[02:44:39.658 --> 02:44:43.941]  Go sign up there for free email alerts or become a lifetime member.
[02:44:43.941 --> 02:44:46.182]  Okay, I'm going to jam in some phone calls here.
[02:44:46.182 --> 02:44:47.203]  We have a key video.
[02:44:47.203 --> 02:44:50.885]  I don't know the title of it yet, but it's going to deal with the engineered collapse of the country.
[02:44:51.645 --> 02:44:51.945]  I don't
[02:45:13.592 --> 02:45:17.153]  Go along with Aaron Dykes's video that we're editing.
[02:45:17.153 --> 02:45:19.854]  We shot it last night and working on it this morning.
[02:45:19.854 --> 02:45:22.295]  That's going out because people need to put the pieces together.
[02:45:22.295 --> 02:45:23.135]  They know something's wrong.
[02:45:23.135 --> 02:45:24.956]  They don't know specifically what it is.
[02:45:24.956 --> 02:45:25.476]  We do.
[02:45:25.476 --> 02:45:36.299]  I mean, the battle's on and coming up in the next hour, I'm going to detail all of this with key information, most important information I've ever covered here on air.
[02:45:36.299 --> 02:45:38.960]  Let's go ahead and talk to Matt in New York.
[02:45:38.960 --> 02:45:39.740]  Matt, thanks for holding.
[02:45:40.678 --> 02:45:43.280]  Alex, Matt from Mobilize the People in New York.
[02:45:43.280 --> 02:45:48.122]  By the way, we just added videos of your broadcast on mobilizethepeople.com to get the message out.
[02:45:48.122 --> 02:45:53.886]  You and Larry are absolutely correct in your assessment of the treasonous behavior by the President and other officials.
[02:45:53.886 --> 02:46:00.890]  The bottom line is they need to be held accountable by the people, which speaks to the larger point you had earlier of accelerating the freedom movement.
[02:46:00.890 --> 02:46:03.011]  We need to be able to reach new people.
[02:46:03.791 --> 02:46:12.618]  Uh, the future of this movement, the freedom movement, depends upon the need to change the language of the debate in a way we can communicate our message so we can reach these new people.
[02:46:12.618 --> 02:46:17.462]  Um, you know, the idea of people having to get involved to promote and sustain freedom is new and scary.
[02:46:17.462 --> 02:46:19.323]  It's a scary concept for a lot of people.
[02:46:19.323 --> 02:46:22.406]  Most people are just used to sitting on their butts and not doing anything.
[02:46:22.406 --> 02:46:30.552]  And now, you know, the proposed with getting up and doing something and fighting for your belief in freedom is a scary concept which paralyzes a lot of people.
[02:46:30.552 --> 02:46:31.573]  Well, here's an analogy.
[02:46:32.393 --> 02:46:46.914]  If you went to Yellowstone Park now in the rural areas, the uninhabited areas, some of the more remote areas, where they've introduced hundreds of vicious timber wolves, and you went out and poured pig blood all over yourself and tied yourself down, they would come and eat you.
[02:46:47.375 --> 02:46:49.095]  That's the same thing with tyrants.
[02:46:49.095 --> 02:46:56.277]  If we just sit there watching our TV sets and sucking our thumbs and doing nothing and not being involved, we will be overrun, we will be oppressed.
[02:46:56.277 --> 02:47:00.738]  There is no option here, and I appreciate your call, Matt.
[02:47:00.738 --> 02:47:01.818]  Mary in Texas.
[02:47:01.818 --> 02:47:03.718]  Mary, you're on the air.
[02:47:03.718 --> 02:47:05.178]  Yes, Alex.
[02:47:05.178 --> 02:47:07.639]  I work with Richard Reeves on the toll road.
[02:47:07.639 --> 02:47:12.500]  I want to encourage everybody to go to turftexas.org.
[02:47:14.623 --> 02:47:17.104]  Because they are stealing from the pension funds.
[02:47:17.104 --> 02:47:19.925]  We're trying to stop that in the legislature.
[02:47:19.925 --> 02:47:24.726]  They need to go down to the legislature and work on that and try to get that stopped.
[02:47:24.726 --> 02:47:30.488]  The toll roads are going to be used to finance the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[02:47:30.488 --> 02:47:42.032]  The Trans-Texas Corridor is just a corridor that goes up from China, if you can imagine this, from China to the deep water ports in Mexico.
[02:47:43.032 --> 02:47:44.073]  I don't know.
[02:48:05.629 --> 02:48:17.217]  Mike, what I wanted to hear from you on, that's why we opened the phones up, is I want to hear from you about Obama's advisors saying they need to stage terror attack, and the police saying they're not going to protect you, they're going to let society totally collapse.
[02:48:17.217 --> 02:48:21.619]  Now, Larry Pratt agreed that's the scenario, and I want to hear from you, Mary.
[02:48:21.619 --> 02:48:22.640]  I want your perspective.
[02:48:22.640 --> 02:48:24.541]  What do you think about those issues?
[02:48:24.541 --> 02:48:28.204]  Well, let me try to explain this to you.
[02:48:28.204 --> 02:48:33.387]  The big trans-Texas corridor is being built to carry big, heavy army equipment.
[02:48:34.008 --> 02:48:35.352]  What do you think of that?
[02:48:35.352 --> 02:48:38.922]  And when they have the toll roads, they're going to shut those roads down when they want!
[02:48:40.066 --> 02:48:41.207]  Hello Alex, thanks for having me on.
[02:49:09.244 --> 02:49:12.245]  So about a month ago, I was on my way home.
[02:49:12.245 --> 02:49:15.306]  I went out and had a drink with a friend of mine.
[02:49:15.306 --> 02:49:17.366]  And I wasn't drunk or anything, really.
[02:49:17.366 --> 02:49:19.047]  I had just a couple beers.
[02:49:19.047 --> 02:49:25.049]  And on my way home, on the highway, the 101 North up here in Northern California, I was attacked by a hitchhiker.
[02:49:25.049 --> 02:49:26.729]  So I called 911.
[02:49:26.729 --> 02:49:30.050]  Why did you stop for a hitchhiker?
[02:49:30.050 --> 02:49:31.030]  I didn't stop.
[02:49:31.030 --> 02:49:35.432]  He stepped in the path of the bike lane, forcing me to veer into the middle of the highway.
[02:49:36.534 --> 02:49:41.577]  And, uh, so I called because in good conscience I couldn't pretty much just let this crazy guy just stand outside the freeway.
[02:49:41.577 --> 02:49:42.998]  Well, no, no, that's the message.
[02:49:42.998 --> 02:49:45.660]  That's the message, and that's the point I wanted to make today.
[02:49:45.660 --> 02:49:49.283]  When you call the cops, especially in these corrupt cities, they end up taking you to jail.
[02:49:49.283 --> 02:49:51.624]  They don't want you calling them.
[02:49:51.624 --> 02:49:53.425]  Yeah, and that's exactly what happened.
[02:49:53.425 --> 02:49:59.489]  Um, I was pretty much, uh, incarcerated temporarily, five days, deprived of freedom because they said I had a concealed weapon.
[02:49:59.489 --> 02:50:01.851]  It was a sheathed knife clearly hanging on my right side.
[02:50:02.578 --> 02:50:08.281]  The officer pretty much turned around, and I'm sure the crazy hitchhiker got scared away by the lights, pretty much.
[02:50:08.281 --> 02:50:11.143]  And so this little tyrant pretty much flipped out.
[02:50:11.143 --> 02:50:23.709]  So let's be clear, you're on a bicycle, you got a knife to protect yourself, California is collapsing like Mexico, it's going the exact same direction, and you went to jail for having a knife and he claimed you couldn't drink a couple beers and ride your bicycle.
[02:50:23.709 --> 02:50:28.452]  Yeah, he spins around behind me, throws me up into a street sign, and then puts me on the hood of his cruiser.
[02:50:28.857 --> 02:50:30.578]  Well you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
[02:50:44.446 --> 02:50:48.588]  I mean, I'm not saying what they did was wrong, but a lot of times they get confused.
[02:50:48.588 --> 02:50:49.849]  They hear there's a hitchhiker.
[02:50:49.849 --> 02:50:51.550]  They probably thought you were the hitchhiker.
[02:50:51.550 --> 02:50:52.331]  I appreciate your call.
[02:50:52.331 --> 02:50:53.551]  That's a terrible story.
[02:50:53.551 --> 02:51:03.557]  Folks, only once or twice a week do I say, hey, I want to talk about these subjects, and nobody ever does it, so I just won't take calls, I guess.
[02:51:03.557 --> 02:51:06.739]  So you think the massive Gulf oil leak won't affect the air you breathe?
[02:51:07.290 --> 02:51:08.630]  Think again!
[02:51:08.630 --> 02:51:16.272]  Benzene, a toxic gas emitted from crude oil and a known carcinogen, is now airborne traveling hundreds, even thousands of miles inland.
[02:51:16.272 --> 02:51:23.494]  Whether you live near the Gulf or not, benzene and other volatile organic compounds could cause adverse reactions to those living inside your home.
[02:51:23.494 --> 02:51:28.876]  NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, came to airfiltersandpurifiers.com for answers.
[02:51:29.096 --> 02:51:32.059]  On how to clean the air on boats, aiding in the Gulf cleanup.

[02:52:02.702 --> 02:52:05.084]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:52:05.084 --> 02:52:07.405]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:52:07.405 --> 02:52:10.628]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:52:10.628 --> 02:52:15.731]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:15.731 --> 02:52:19.914]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:20.234 --> 02:52:22.695]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:22.695 --> 02:52:25.456]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:25.456 --> 02:52:28.378]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:28.378 --> 02:52:35.981]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:36.317 --> 02:52:41.702]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:41.702 --> 02:52:44.564]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:44.564 --> 02:52:48.247]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:48.247 --> 02:52:49.328]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:49.328 --> 02:52:50.669]  You're everyone else.

[02:53:32.948 --> 02:53:37.511]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:53:37.511 --> 02:53:43.335]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:53:43.335 --> 02:53:46.977]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[02:54:09.009 --> 02:54:12.209]  Two top stories up at GCNlive.com.
[02:54:12.209 --> 02:54:15.190]  Top Clinton official, only a terror attack can save Obama.
[02:54:15.190 --> 02:54:17.470]  I'm covering that coming up in the next hour.
[02:54:17.470 --> 02:54:20.211]  You can also listen on the streams at Infowars.com.
[02:54:20.211 --> 02:54:24.872]  CNN's Sanchez says dead Americans good for war against manufactured terror.
[02:54:25.792 --> 02:54:29.953]  It's such important information, ladies and gentlemen, at GCNLive.com.
[02:54:29.953 --> 02:54:38.136]  I'm going to jam in a few more of your phone calls, but first I wanted to tell people about AcolaBlue.com atmospheric water generators.
[02:54:38.136 --> 02:54:42.617]  It just looks like a water, you know, bottle system without the water bottle on top.
[02:54:42.617 --> 02:54:45.438]  Great little computerized system, grabs the water out of the air.
[02:54:45.438 --> 02:54:47.239]  Seven and a half gallons with their smallest unit.
[02:54:48.239 --> 02:54:50.540]  And it's the best, cleanest drinking water you can get, period.
[02:54:50.540 --> 02:54:59.745]  acolablue.com, E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com, acolablue.com, or 800-691-6043, 800-691-6043.
[02:54:59.745 --> 02:55:04.788]  Check it out, a whole new way to get the purest water available, acolablue.com.
[02:55:04.788 --> 02:55:06.649]  Okay, I'll take a few more calls, and I love your calls.
[02:55:06.649 --> 02:55:07.669]  It's usually wide open phones.
[02:55:07.669 --> 02:55:12.512]  A lot of stations and networks don't do that in shows, but I do want to get your take on
[02:55:13.814 --> 02:55:14.654]  Hey Alex, how are you today?
[02:55:31.656 --> 02:55:32.596]  Good.
[02:55:32.596 --> 02:55:34.717]  First of all, I don't want to waste your time.
[02:55:34.717 --> 02:55:36.258]  I just want to thank you for all you do.
[02:55:36.258 --> 02:55:38.299]  I haven't had a chance to call in, but thank you, sir.
[02:55:38.299 --> 02:55:41.600]  You are truly doing a great deed.
[02:55:41.600 --> 02:55:43.561]  Thank you, Brandon, but I'm not doing a great deed.
[02:55:43.561 --> 02:55:44.602]  I'm trying to survive.
[02:55:44.602 --> 02:55:46.603]  I mean, this is tyranny coming in on us.
[02:55:46.603 --> 02:55:48.183]  This is what everybody's got to do.
[02:55:48.183 --> 02:55:49.384]  But I appreciate you.
[02:55:49.384 --> 02:55:52.885]  What do you think of this White House advisor saying Obama needs an Oklahoma City bombing?
[02:55:52.885 --> 02:55:55.326]  You know, I've been saying they're going to do that and blame it on us.
[02:55:55.326 --> 02:55:56.327]  I've been seeing the preparations.
[02:55:57.148 --> 02:55:57.789]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:55:57.789 --> 02:56:01.192]  These things have been coming for not only months now, years now.
[02:56:01.192 --> 02:56:02.573]  They've been coming in America.
[02:56:02.573 --> 02:56:03.694]  They've been coming right at us.
[02:56:03.694 --> 02:56:08.258]  The tell-tale signs of tyranny happen right in front of us, and we've just been ignoring them.
[02:56:08.258 --> 02:56:14.884]  I mean, obviously, you haven't or I haven't, but the majority, you know, like you said, everybody's been distracted with LeBron or American Idol.
[02:56:14.884 --> 02:56:15.765]  They're not.
[02:56:15.765 --> 02:56:17.507]  Everything is right in front of them.
[02:56:17.507 --> 02:56:21.190]  Well, it's like ignoring a cockroach problem when there's two or three, and a year later there's 500.
[02:56:22.708 --> 02:56:23.548]  Mm-hmm.
[02:56:23.548 --> 02:56:33.350]  You see in Oceania, in Georgia, well, you see rocket bombs coming in to London every day to keep the polls in check, you know, to constantly keep them afraid and to depend on the government.
[02:56:33.350 --> 02:56:36.831]  And Winston Smith figures out the government's doing it.
[02:56:36.831 --> 02:56:37.931]  Exactly.
[02:56:37.931 --> 02:56:40.091]  And, you know, it's the same thing here, you know.
[02:56:40.091 --> 02:56:44.732]  Not only Nazi Germany and Stalin, you know, they're, uh, false flight terror attacks.
[02:56:44.732 --> 02:56:47.653]  We have them here, you know, 9-11, you know, oh, what happens next?
[02:56:47.653 --> 02:56:50.694]  Oh, we go into Iraq, we have this, then you have BP, what do you have?
[02:56:50.694 --> 02:56:52.434]  Oh, you have a new carbon tax and all this.
[02:56:52.970 --> 02:56:55.411]  And I'm sure it will come through Congress in the next couple months.
[02:56:55.411 --> 02:56:57.792]  You know, I don't understand why we're the crazy ones.
[02:56:57.792 --> 02:57:04.494]  Obviously, they want us to look like that, but nobody else... Well, I just keep saying that to ignore, you know, what you're saying, but it doesn't work anymore.
[02:57:04.494 --> 02:57:05.675]  Brandon, great call.
[02:57:05.675 --> 02:57:09.296]  Chris in Maryland, you're on the air.
[02:57:09.296 --> 02:57:09.836]  Hello?
[02:57:09.836 --> 02:57:10.857]  Yes, sir.
[02:57:10.857 --> 02:57:11.817]  Yes.
[02:57:11.817 --> 02:57:17.159]  Um, I was just thinking, I'm going to stay on topic, because I know I don't want to agitate you today, and that's not what I'm here for.
[02:57:17.159 --> 02:57:19.740]  But, um, it reminds me of what happened during Bush.
[02:57:20.464 --> 02:57:27.849]  His ratings would fall, they would stage something, oh, we caught a terrorist here, we caught a terrorist there, then his ratings would go back up.
[02:57:27.849 --> 02:57:29.790]  It was like a seesaw the whole entire time.
[02:57:29.790 --> 02:57:36.315]  And Ridge came out in his book last year, the head of Homeland Security, and said they were staging that, and the terror alerts were fake.
[02:57:36.315 --> 02:57:39.036]  What an incredible admission.
[02:57:39.036 --> 02:57:39.797]  Exactly.
[02:57:39.797 --> 02:57:46.021]  And the sick thing is, like you say, they openly admit to the garbage.
[02:57:46.021 --> 02:57:47.482]  It's absolutely sick.
[02:57:48.343 --> 02:57:48.964]  I don't know.
[02:58:01.679 --> 02:58:08.424]  Well, it's just total, total implosion.
[02:58:08.424 --> 02:58:15.129]  It's like this billboard saying, National Socialist, Communist Socialist, Marxist Socialist, Democrat Socialist.
[02:58:15.129 --> 02:58:17.210]  We know what this change is.
[02:58:17.210 --> 02:58:18.751]  But Obama will go.
[02:58:18.751 --> 02:58:21.213]  He won't be there soon.
[02:58:21.213 --> 02:58:22.774]  But the tyranny will stay there.
[02:58:22.774 --> 02:58:25.737]  We've got to start removing the tyranny, not just the puppets.
[02:58:26.577 --> 02:58:31.264]  And so everybody puts up a billboard, starts a newsletter, calls in to talk radio.
[02:58:31.264 --> 02:58:33.928]  The power of what you're doing is incredible.
[02:58:33.928 --> 02:58:38.334]  And I couldn't do it without my sponsors, the affiliates, the Genesis Network, my crew, everybody.
[02:58:38.334 --> 02:58:39.295]  God bless you.
[02:58:39.295 --> 02:58:40.397]  We couldn't do this without you.
[02:58:40.397 --> 02:58:41.538]  Vital info coming up.
