[00:00.000 --> 00:05.640]  I came back to see him a few weeks later, and by that time we were bombing in Afghanistan.
[00:05.640 --> 00:07.360]  I said, are we still going to war with Iraq?
[00:07.360 --> 00:09.280]  And he said, oh, it's worse than that.
[00:09.280 --> 00:13.280]  He said, he reached over on his desk, he picked up a piece of paper, and he said, I just,
[00:13.280 --> 00:16.600]  he said, I just got this down from upstairs, meaning the Secretary of Defense's office
[00:16.600 --> 00:17.600]  today.
[00:17.600 --> 00:22.200]  And he said, this is a memo that describes how we're going to take out seven countries
[00:22.200 --> 00:28.040]  in five years, starting with Iraq and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and
[00:28.040 --> 00:29.040]  finishing off Iran.
[00:29.040 --> 00:30.040]  We'll be right back, folks.
[00:30.040 --> 00:35.280]  Third hour coming up, your calls, special guests who's being censored, part of this
[00:35.280 --> 00:39.880]  reign of censorship that's going on, stay with us.

[00:41.880 --> 00:42.880]  Nightly news tonight, 7.
[00:42.880 --> 00:43.880]  I'll be back live Sunday, 4-6.
[00:43.880 --> 00:52.480]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so
[00:52.480 --> 00:55.400]  much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:55.400 --> 01:00.240]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:00.240 --> 01:04.560]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:04.560 --> 01:07.760]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:07.760 --> 01:13.120]  You now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:13.120 --> 01:17.000]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come
[01:17.000 --> 01:20.640]  out with rare earth and deep earth crystals.
[01:20.640 --> 01:25.040]  And the results that I personally have had have been life changing.
[01:25.040 --> 01:29.880]  Iodine has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:29.880 --> 01:30.880]  This is innovating.
[01:30.880 --> 01:35.800]  And the best part is it helps fund infowars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media
[01:35.800 --> 01:40.440]  operation, promoting true libertarian ideas for a limited time, experience the ancient
[01:40.440 --> 01:46.240]  power of survival shield X2, take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox
[01:46.240 --> 01:50.520]  special at infowarslife.com.
[01:50.520 --> 01:53.840]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[01:53.840 --> 02:08.240]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[02:08.240 --> 02:12.040]  It's always a tough boat because the average person thinks raising the debt ceiling must
[02:12.040 --> 02:14.520]  mean that we're running up our debt.
[02:14.520 --> 02:19.320]  Raising the debt ceiling, which has been done over 100 times, does not increase our
[02:19.320 --> 02:20.320]  debt.
[02:20.320 --> 02:23.480]  It does not somehow promote profligacy.
[02:23.480 --> 02:33.880]  All it does is it says, you got to pay the bills that you've already racked up, Congress.
[02:33.880 --> 02:51.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:51.960 --> 02:53.960]  You got a business.
[02:53.960 --> 02:54.960]  You didn't know that.
[02:54.960 --> 02:55.960]  Somebody else did that.
[02:55.960 --> 02:58.480]  A lot of people saying you raise the debt limit.
[02:58.480 --> 02:59.480]  It raises the debt.
[02:59.480 --> 03:00.480]  No, it doesn't.
[03:00.480 --> 03:01.480]  It doesn't raise the debt at all.
[03:01.480 --> 03:05.280]  This means we're going to pay our bills.
[03:05.280 --> 03:09.240]  Two plus two equals five.
[03:09.240 --> 03:11.280]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:11.280 --> 03:18.640]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Sunday Worldwide Edition, the 22nd day already
[03:18.640 --> 03:22.480]  of June, 2014.
[03:22.480 --> 03:25.720]  We just had the longest day of the year yesterday, right?
[03:25.720 --> 03:26.720]  Longest day of the year.
[03:26.720 --> 03:29.040]  What do they call that?
[03:29.040 --> 03:31.320]  The summer solstice.
[03:31.320 --> 03:37.120]  The longest day of the year yesterday, and I had a chance to spend that with some of
[03:37.120 --> 03:38.120]  my family.
[03:38.120 --> 03:39.120]  It was wonderful.
[03:39.120 --> 03:42.800]  I hope you're having a great time here on this wondrous, beautiful earth with all these
[03:42.800 --> 03:48.360]  amazing creations and that we can transcend the globalist and those that try to shudder
[03:48.360 --> 03:55.480]  the gates of reality and keep our horizons very, very narrow and very, very restricted
[03:55.480 --> 04:02.080]  because it is in looking up from the dirt from the globalist artificial reality that
[04:02.080 --> 04:11.280]  we will discover the wider universe around us and realize just how diseased and twisted
[04:11.280 --> 04:24.640]  the minds of the globalist are worm eaten by ego maniacal delusions of control freak
[04:24.640 --> 04:29.600]  paradises they're going to build and all they ever seem to build is hell.
[04:29.600 --> 04:33.840]  Hillary Clinton was in town Friday here in Austin, Texas where he come to you from all
[04:33.840 --> 04:39.520]  over the world, come to you from Austin and broadcast around the world, transmit and stream
[04:39.520 --> 04:43.120]  via info wars.com around the world.
[04:43.120 --> 04:47.800]  And our reporters David Knight and Kit Daniels did a great job.
[04:47.800 --> 04:52.080]  Some of it they got on video with hidden watch cameras.
[04:52.080 --> 04:58.240]  Other parts they got off of iPhone audio because obviously it's hard to stick a camera in Hillary's
[04:58.240 --> 05:03.320]  face when you're standing right in front of her and they had all sorts of security people
[05:03.320 --> 05:12.520]  there doing the TSA pat downs which are now ubiquitous not just you know first the airports
[05:12.520 --> 05:19.800]  and then the sports stadiums now it's it's everywhere to get around the private citizen
[05:19.800 --> 05:27.720]  Hillary Clinton before you had to be the secret service protection you had to be the president
[05:27.720 --> 05:33.600]  of their immediate family and now it's just anybody from the government period everyone
[05:33.600 --> 05:40.760]  gets groped and then now it's you go to any event you get groped which is the total conversion
[05:40.760 --> 05:46.880]  of this country and this world this has been done worldwide into a classical police state
[05:46.880 --> 05:51.040]  where we basically live in an open air prison.
[05:51.040 --> 05:54.240]  But we have that video on that audio up on info wars.com.
[05:54.240 --> 05:59.400]  She attacked Matt Drudge and the alternative media saying it was basically lies and she
[05:59.400 --> 06:03.000]  attacked the Second Amendment and elaborated on her statement from earlier in the week
[06:03.000 --> 06:08.640]  that we'll cue back up from CNN where she said people's views of the Second Amendment
[06:08.640 --> 06:11.840]  terrorize the public in her basically terrorism.
[06:11.840 --> 06:21.080]  So our reporters got through the blockade where the narcissist ego maniac Queen B Hillary
[06:21.080 --> 06:28.160]  Clinton was there holding court to all of the anti male women that have been programmed
[06:28.160 --> 06:32.640]  to think that their empowerment comes to the destruction of men.
[06:32.640 --> 06:40.320]  Basically a cult of women seething with the desire for power totally programmed by the
[06:40.320 --> 06:46.280]  known CIA operative Hillary Rodham Clinton who was groomed from high school by the way
[06:46.280 --> 06:51.560]  life magazine is back there in dues office since I mentioned that I want to show that
[06:51.560 --> 06:55.520]  to people we're going to play that video and more the latest on the border the latest
[06:55.520 --> 07:00.280]  on the economy stay with us a very important transmission from the water table to our soils
[07:00.280 --> 07:05.520]  to the atmosphere itself our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day but
[07:05.520 --> 07:09.840]  it's not just the air outside that's toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five
[07:09.840 --> 07:14.280]  times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend
[07:14.280 --> 07:19.720]  90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are more than 42 million
[07:19.720 --> 07:24.360]  smokers in the United States well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to
[07:24.360 --> 07:28.600]  numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets
[07:28.600 --> 07:32.400]  they're allergic to as well when I began to research these statistics it was clear to
[07:32.400 --> 07:37.760]  me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that
[07:37.760 --> 07:42.840]  we cannot escape but we can fight back against made with organic and wild cultivated herbs
[07:42.840 --> 07:48.000]  and manufactured in the USA the new info wars life lung cleanse is here in a convenient spray
[07:48.000 --> 07:52.440]  bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment now available exclusively
[07:52.440 --> 08:10.840]  an info wars life dot com or by calling toll 3888 to 533139 you want answers well so does
[08:10.840 --> 08:37.040]  he live from the info wars dot com studios well South Dakota Republicans have just passed
[08:37.040 --> 08:43.760]  a resolution demanding Obama impeachment we had members of Congress on Friday we covered
[08:43.760 --> 08:50.640]  the report that are saying they have the votes now in the house to start impeachment to indict
[08:50.640 --> 08:56.680]  Obama for all sorts of unconstitutional high crimes and misdemeanors and then have the trial
[08:56.680 --> 09:03.680]  in the Senate and what I've already told everybody I'm not even an IT person but I knew this and
[09:03.680 --> 09:09.400]  checked with my IT people and right Bart is reporting it and confirming it off of the
[09:09.400 --> 09:20.200]  federal purchase orders and federal contracts lost emails the IRS has a contract with an
[09:20.200 --> 09:27.080]  email backup company yes the federal government is under even stricter laws and regulations
[09:27.080 --> 09:34.480]  about saving information in the public that's why remember the head of the energy department
[09:34.480 --> 09:40.000]  and others got caught a few years ago and had to resign because they had dummy emails
[09:40.000 --> 09:48.480]  under under pseudonyms was fitting that some of the pseudonyms were for British royalty
[09:48.480 --> 09:52.560]  that's how the bureaucratic class sees themselves trying to shut down our industry shut down
[09:52.560 --> 09:58.520]  our power plants and more tried to put tracker boxes and all the cars attached by the mile
[09:58.520 --> 10:03.600]  remember all that that was discussed in separate private emails they had illegally in the government
[10:03.600 --> 10:10.880]  running policy so that's brought some of these scallywags down and it's come out that they
[10:10.880 --> 10:18.480]  were ordered to persecute pro-life first Christian groups that weren't establishment tea party
[10:18.480 --> 10:26.120]  groups that persecutions public and they keep claiming lowest learner and others that you
[10:26.120 --> 10:31.000]  know they didn't do anything wrong but now they've been caught and so they're in a box
[10:31.000 --> 10:36.720]  they're cornered and they said you know throughout the agency everybody who supposedly emailed
[10:36.720 --> 10:42.680]  each other on who was to be targeted under Obama's orders all of those hard drives were
[10:42.680 --> 10:47.840]  taken out of the computers in the last year and they were destroyed well there's a big
[10:47.840 --> 10:53.520]  problem of that most people don't back their emails up on their computer almost all email
[10:53.520 --> 10:58.640]  systems including the ones the IRS has been confirmed by the federal contracts are on
[10:58.640 --> 11:06.440]  servers and then they're backed up to data tapes that's still the cheapest way we do
[11:06.440 --> 11:14.600]  it here with a data tape box we don't keep you know general junk emails but backups of
[11:14.600 --> 11:21.440]  the site backups of news backups of data it's backed up on tapes and more and more it's
[11:21.440 --> 11:31.840]  going to clouds so it is pure manifest unmitigated bull it's like catching your child up in the
[11:31.840 --> 11:38.160]  cupboard with cookies in their hand in their left hand with their right hand shoving cookies
[11:38.160 --> 11:42.280]  in their face and they look at you and say I didn't eat any of the cookies except this
[11:42.280 --> 11:47.160]  isn't some harmless thing like getting cookies out of the cupboard out of the pantry when
[11:47.160 --> 11:52.760]  you haven't eaten your dinner yet this is sending the government out to audit and persecute
[11:52.760 --> 12:01.680]  and arrest and harass and deny charity 501c3 to anyone that's not in a criminal operation
[12:01.680 --> 12:08.440]  with a democratic party like we saw with acorn and others and their and their Obamacare navigators
[12:08.440 --> 12:16.680]  again we just joined us we are live it is the 22nd day of june 2014 on this live live

[12:35.920 --> 12:42.120]  days a week weekdays 11am to 2pm and then back sundays 4 to 6 central and they said
[12:42.120 --> 12:49.520]  no cameras allowed at the book people and that you could simply pay your money to go

[13:02.480 --> 13:09.160]  of it even though they frisked everyone we they did not catch the wrist watch cameras
[13:09.160 --> 13:17.800]  that are in close to hd not hd yet but they're they're close to it and so this is a very
[13:17.800 --> 13:23.640]  important information we're gonna play david night's report when we come back they're

[17:06.360 --> 17:16.520]  i see it i know it when i see it and that's what hillary clinton is and has always been

[17:22.040 --> 17:28.240]  back and you know they throw out these little rights oh we'll let gays marry or whatever
[17:28.240 --> 17:32.280]  it's all just a political football ball when it comes to banker bailouts and looting the
[17:32.280 --> 17:37.160]  economy and food prices exploding and and and the and the federal reserve they just make
[17:37.160 --> 17:41.520]  it about the puppet hillary because she herself is just a puppet though a high level gangster
[17:41.520 --> 17:45.960]  in the power structure it's a distraction from the good old boys club at goldman sacks
[17:45.960 --> 17:50.400]  and all the big banks that are literally funding the gun control the open borders the end of
[17:50.400 --> 17:55.680]  america north american union garbage general petraeus the london telegraph admitted the
[17:55.680 --> 18:01.040]  open borders are about the north american union i began to get into iodine a few years

[22:27.360 --> 22:31.480]  all the scandals back in the nineties with the clinton's all the corruption for me though
[22:31.480 --> 22:35.800]  the biggest one is currently bill clinton's charity keeps about half the money that came
[22:35.800 --> 22:41.200]  out in the news that he raises for Haitian kids to run a fleet of jets and houses and
[22:41.200 --> 22:45.240]  things for himself even though he's worth tens of millions of dollars separately from
[22:45.240 --> 22:51.120]  that his payoff for swindling the american people getting nafta and gat passed remember
[22:51.120 --> 22:56.120]  they told you nafta and gat would be a great thing for everybody how do you like the industrialization
[22:56.120 --> 23:01.460]  now but there's a new article that broke on friday and we have the audio coming up with
[23:01.460 --> 23:08.760]  david night as well and that deals with victim of pedophile rapist hillary clinton took
[23:08.760 --> 23:18.920]  me through hell and there's a recording now of it so we're going to be breaking all of
[23:18.920 --> 23:23.800]  that down to hillary clinton's involvement remember all the women that got raped by bill
[23:23.800 --> 23:30.880]  clinton and he would settle the cases and then the feminist the so-called feminist would
[23:30.880 --> 23:35.000]  come out and attack those women because these aren't feminists these are people that are
[23:35.000 --> 23:42.880]  about a power structure they're a gang and they're doing a great job wrecking society
[23:42.880 --> 23:50.840]  and civilization by the way speaking of hillary clinton just this which just never seems to
[23:50.840 --> 24:11.680]  go away here is the article out of life magazine the issue is june 20th 19 1969 and in it it's
[24:11.680 --> 24:16.040]  got hillary the little genius who was just getting out of college at the time who they
[24:16.040 --> 24:20.520]  would you know said would be basically running our country later and how great socialism is
[24:20.520 --> 24:29.760]  she totally groomed from the beginning these are sinister technicians that know exactly
[24:29.760 --> 24:34.640]  what they're doing and they've done a fabulous job and again i'm not getting off on some
[24:34.640 --> 24:40.800]  hillary bashing tangent it's just that she came out will play this clip coming up last
[24:40.800 --> 24:48.320]  week on CNN and said that owning guns isn't just the issue no it's people that promote
[24:48.320 --> 24:52.920]  the right don't have a right to terrorize everyone with our speech and david night was
[24:52.920 --> 24:56.920]  able to talk to her and she elaborated on that they said no cameras but public interest
[24:56.920 --> 25:00.560]  is above that when she visited book people the press isn't going to be shut down anymore
[25:00.560 --> 25:04.400]  so david night and kit daniels we're both able to get questions in the audios from a
[25:04.400 --> 25:11.120]  hidden watch microphone system so it's not the best audio but it is audible even on am
[25:11.120 --> 25:15.640]  radio we've tested it and separately that dovetails with this now this happened our
[25:15.640 --> 25:23.760]  reporters tuesday live on air in brownsville at the big bridge they would try to get over
[25:23.760 --> 25:27.200]  and the feds were claiming they owned that's the whole side of the river even though they
[25:27.200 --> 25:33.800]  didn't and we couldn't be there with cameras we have video of that just just get back guys
[25:33.800 --> 25:40.160]  running up with the machine guns as they bring in the illegals and we have video again that
[25:40.160 --> 25:48.280]  is up on info wars dot com drudge link to it it went viral it was on fox news but that
[25:48.280 --> 25:51.960]  happened at least three times last week that fox picked up our video for the border of
[25:51.960 --> 25:56.480]  the kids being masked being shipped deeper in where they're being held at churches the
[25:56.480 --> 26:03.040]  buses come in at brownsville come in at mcowan other areas in texas the greyhound buses the
[26:03.040 --> 26:08.240]  board patrol gives them their vouchers to go wherever they want on greyhound a coded number
[26:08.240 --> 26:13.760]  where greyhounds just told take them wherever they want new york city michigan detroit wherever
[26:13.760 --> 26:18.920]  they want to go austin texas you take them there you just take illegals men women children
[26:18.920 --> 26:24.400]  babies you don't just drop them off this is human trafficking completely illegal and
[26:24.400 --> 26:30.000]  then right bart has video of it now it happened to them yesterday us media restricted at border
[26:30.000 --> 26:37.600]  federal agents site safety concerns at the gran gino city texas a remote section of the
[26:37.600 --> 26:43.480]  u.s. border near the international bridge is one of the few places where media can witness
[26:43.480 --> 26:48.080]  and record the mass crossings of minors coming from central america the u.s. board patrol
[26:48.080 --> 26:52.240]  is now restricting journalists access the area setting safety concerns no they're not
[26:52.240 --> 26:58.400]  you are loading them on buses and shipping them in i have the head of mcowan emergency
[26:58.400 --> 27:03.200]  management and then people didn't believe it a day later paul watson found the federal
[27:03.200 --> 27:10.120]  purchase order in the federal contract at fez business ops from january to hire the
[27:10.120 --> 27:15.680]  tens of thousands of contractors to go run this and we caught fema pre deploying food
[27:15.680 --> 27:21.200]  to these bases a year ago for this we have them premeditated like everything else five
[27:21.200 --> 27:29.080]  time ago before we got a break let's go to david night's kit daniel's report from hillary
[27:29.080 --> 27:35.040]  coming to texas and attacking matt drudge and the second amendment outrageous let's
[27:35.040 --> 27:40.320]  go to this authoritarian hillary clinton is pushing her book and her candidacy on the
[27:40.320 --> 27:45.160]  public she's made some pretty controversial statements lately about matt drudge about
[27:45.160 --> 27:49.560]  the second amendment kit daniels and i went to her book signing here in austin and what
[27:49.560 --> 27:56.800]  we found was contradiction hypocrisy and really a kind of dangerous intolerance of the first
[27:56.800 --> 28:02.440]  amendment in free speech on a recent npr interview she said matt drudge was one of a quote bunch
[28:02.440 --> 28:08.520]  of gamers and then she said there's a difference between fair game and playing games so kit
[28:08.520 --> 28:11.600]  asked her about the influence of drudge did he have too much influence what about other
[28:11.600 --> 28:36.920]  internet sites this is what she had to say so she kind of tells kit that she supports
[28:36.920 --> 28:42.360]  a free marketplace of ideas you know may the best man or woman win but that's not what
[28:42.360 --> 28:47.320]  she said when it came to gun owners she was very intolerant of viewpoints of people who
[28:47.320 --> 28:52.600]  opposed gun control she said earlier just a couple of days ago that they terrorized the
[28:52.600 --> 29:08.840]  public with those viewpoints so i asked her for some clarification
[29:08.840 --> 29:26.020]  i went to the first amendment
[29:26.020 --> 29:43.600]  How's that for a contradiction?
[29:43.600 --> 29:45.940]  No free marketplace of ideas there.
[29:45.940 --> 29:51.180]  People she disagrees with have to be silenced because they're terrorizing the public.
[29:51.180 --> 29:55.800]  Then there's the hypocrisy of these elitists who are constantly pushing gun control.
[29:55.800 --> 30:00.860]  For passing through layer after layer after layer of security at the book signing, she
[30:00.860 --> 30:07.420]  clarified for me that the 99.99% of us without an army of security guards should just shut
[30:07.420 --> 30:12.220]  up about our right to keep and bear arms or be labeled as terrorists.
[30:12.220 --> 30:16.940]  Going back again to that NPR interview, she'd said that debates about her physical condition
[30:16.940 --> 30:19.860]  isn't the debate that the American people want to have.
[30:19.860 --> 30:24.980]  She said they want to debate things like tax policy or economic growth or climate change.
[30:24.980 --> 30:30.180]  But clearly Hillary Clinton doesn't want a debate on our rights.
[30:30.180 --> 30:34.100]  Debates don't mean anything if our leaders don't have character.
[30:34.100 --> 30:36.220]  We need people who are going to respect our rights.
[30:36.220 --> 30:40.420]  We need people who are going to trust the American people and we need leaders who are
[30:40.420 --> 30:43.740]  going to obey the law and tolerate free speech.
[30:43.740 --> 30:44.900]  That's right.

[30:59.500 --> 31:03.540]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.

[31:07.980 --> 31:11.540]  What are the health effects of having these drugs and our drinking water?

[31:26.100 --> 31:30.620]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[31:30.620 --> 31:35.940]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[33:59.180 --> 34:02.740]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so
[34:02.740 --> 34:05.660]  much get healthy and detoxify.
[34:05.660 --> 34:10.500]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[34:10.500 --> 34:14.820]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[34:14.820 --> 34:18.020]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[34:18.020 --> 34:23.380]  You now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb.

[35:04.020 --> 35:11.020]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[35:34.020 --> 35:45.100]  I will say it again, I've been a libertarian on the public scene for 22 years on air 19.
[35:45.100 --> 35:51.700]  I am absolutely nonpartisan as everyone knows, and literally savage, George W. Bush up one
[35:51.700 --> 35:56.580]  side and down the other, 24-7 for eight years.
[35:56.580 --> 36:00.700]  The fact that things just got worse under Obama is part of the larger ongoing process
[36:00.700 --> 36:05.540]  of evil and the elites getting away with anything you can imagine.
[36:05.540 --> 36:13.460]  But when you talk about the Democrats and the Clintons and what Obama's doing, it is
[36:13.460 --> 36:17.420]  five orders of magnitude of what Bush and the Republicans ever did.
[36:17.420 --> 36:21.540]  It makes Richard Nixon, who was terrible in many respects and who I would have supported
[36:21.540 --> 36:26.460]  impeachment of if he wouldn't have resigned, look like an angel.
[36:26.460 --> 36:33.580]  I mean, you study the yardstick of real politic and look at Hillary and what they do.
[36:33.580 --> 36:41.660]  These are gangster, vicious, evil people who openly are arming al-Qaeda to take over
[36:41.660 --> 36:46.940]  Iraq and Islamification of the entire country and murdering every Christian they find.
[36:46.940 --> 36:50.260]  They do the same thing in Syria, Libya, and folks, they're funding it.
[36:50.260 --> 36:52.300]  It's all over the foreign news.
[36:52.300 --> 36:54.020]  Total fact they're doing that.
[36:54.020 --> 36:58.020]  Total fact they staged fast and furious, killed thousands to blend the Second Amendment.
[36:58.020 --> 36:59.940]  That came out CBS News of Memos.
[36:59.940 --> 37:01.620]  To list their crimes takes hours.
[37:01.620 --> 37:07.300]  They want this country bankrupted and controlled because all of their interest, the corporate
[37:07.300 --> 37:11.380]  interest that fund them, like General Electric, who's exempt from the carbon tax, they'll
[37:11.380 --> 37:15.140]  read it, Obama signed an order, they're taking over.
[37:15.140 --> 37:17.820]  No one else can operate but them.
[37:17.820 --> 37:24.580]  And the entire establishment that's left that isn't homicidal or insane better line
[37:24.580 --> 37:27.180]  up against these people.
[37:27.180 --> 37:30.140]  That's why the Republican leadership is going after the Tea Party right now, and the Tea
[37:30.140 --> 37:32.780]  Party is having a lot of victories, but it needs more.
[37:32.780 --> 37:38.420]  That's why they, oh, the Tea Party, it's dead, no, they're losing it because they're winning
[37:38.420 --> 37:39.760]  so many elections.
[37:39.760 --> 37:43.340]  It's another hoax like saying NAFTA and GATT would be great, or saying Obamacare would
[37:43.340 --> 37:48.900]  cut your price in half or less down to the bill, like your phone bill.
[37:48.900 --> 37:52.340]  Total lies, or you could keep your doctor, or I promise I won't come after any of your
[37:52.340 --> 37:53.340]  guns.
[37:53.340 --> 37:54.340]  It's all lies.
[37:54.340 --> 37:56.340]  I won't hire lobbyists.
[37:56.340 --> 37:58.260]  I won't sign the NDAA, signed it.
[37:58.260 --> 38:01.940]  I mean, it's pure lying.
[38:01.940 --> 38:05.460]  And then running around like there's some type of liberals because they're, quote, gay marriage
[38:05.460 --> 38:06.460]  or something.
[38:06.460 --> 38:07.460]  It's a political football.
[38:07.460 --> 38:09.620]  David Knight's with us into the next hour.
[38:09.620 --> 38:15.300]  On the border, we're going to have our reporters, our intrepid reporters, wild horses couldn't
[38:15.300 --> 38:16.300]  drag them away.
[38:16.300 --> 38:19.060]  I told Kit, I said, listen, you don't have to go down back down to the border.
[38:19.060 --> 38:20.060]  You've just been working all week.
[38:20.060 --> 38:21.380]  He goes, I want to go.
[38:21.380 --> 38:25.300]  So Kit and Rob Jacobson are down there at the border where they're telling reporters
[38:25.300 --> 38:29.740]  they can't videotape on city streets, the board patrol loading illegals on buses and
[38:29.740 --> 38:33.580]  shipping them in and giving them tickets.
[38:33.580 --> 38:39.420]  We have this on video and the emergency manager of the city admitting it to us.
[38:39.420 --> 38:44.660]  Emergency scandal only picked up by a few papers after drudgerport.com linked to our
[38:44.660 --> 38:49.420]  video and all of it, the quotes, living color, all of it happening, not just the emergency
[38:49.420 --> 38:50.420]  manager saying it.
[38:50.420 --> 38:51.420]  It shows it.
[38:51.420 --> 38:58.940]  I mean, the magnitude, if you got caught doing that, it's 10 years in jail, human trafficking,
[38:58.940 --> 39:01.940]  each person, you bring children into it.
[39:01.940 --> 39:07.500]  Oh, my God, I mean, this is effectively kidnapping because no one even knows where these kids
[39:07.500 --> 39:08.500]  are coming from.
[39:08.500 --> 39:14.420]  There's a flood of babies on the buses and the floods only going to accelerate.
[39:14.420 --> 39:15.980]  And I believe it's the false flag.
[39:15.980 --> 39:19.140]  So David, with us 30 minutes or so to the next hour, kids can be joining us as well
[39:19.140 --> 39:21.140]  from the border live video feed.
[39:21.140 --> 39:23.700]  If you're a radio listener, you can always go as well.
[39:23.700 --> 39:26.260]  Later we archive it at prisonplanet.tv.
[39:26.260 --> 39:28.940]  You can also watch a live feed at infowords.com forward slash show.
[39:28.940 --> 39:33.340]  I want to get into the hill everything in the next segment and you know, you and Kit
[39:33.340 --> 39:37.940]  going to ask her questions Friday, but first I want to talk about what we're going to get
[39:37.940 --> 39:38.940]  into after that.
[39:38.940 --> 39:44.740]  This chilling audio of her laughing about how she got child rapist off and I heard this
[39:44.740 --> 39:52.740]  audio today and literally was horrified for my family because when you hear the enjoyment
[39:52.740 --> 39:59.060]  of getting an evil person off and you hear, I mean, it's, it's, but then that's liberal.
[39:59.060 --> 40:02.740]  I mean, you could have the 13 year old having its head chopped off and feminists would roll
[40:02.740 --> 40:05.220]  in the blood if Hillary said it was trendy.
[40:05.220 --> 40:08.940]  I mean, these are just monsters who just want to have the moral high ground.
[40:08.940 --> 40:10.860]  It was amazingly cold.
[40:10.860 --> 40:13.140]  This is a lady who is now 52 years old.
[40:13.140 --> 40:17.860]  She was 13 at the time she was raped and in 2008 when Hillary Clinton was running, she
[40:17.860 --> 40:21.700]  had one brief thing with a reporter that was very contentious.
[40:21.700 --> 40:26.420]  She'd never said anything else about it, but now a tape has surfaced where Hillary is talking
[40:26.420 --> 40:31.220]  to somebody about her past legal experiences and she's saying things like, I got this guy
[40:31.220 --> 40:35.660]  off, he actually passed a polygraph test that destroyed my confidence and polygraph tests
[40:35.660 --> 40:36.660]  forever.
[40:36.660 --> 40:37.660]  Ha, ha, ha.
[40:37.660 --> 40:38.660]  She talks about what he did.
[40:38.660 --> 40:41.620]  She talks about the fact that she got him off in a technicality in the sense that they
[40:41.620 --> 40:44.540]  did the tests on his underwear to test for blood and semen.
[40:44.540 --> 40:48.260]  It was positive, but because they cut a hole in it and they lost that hole or whatever,
[40:48.260 --> 40:49.500]  she got it thrown out.
[40:49.500 --> 40:53.580]  So she's laughing about this covering for this pedophile rapist.
[40:53.580 --> 40:55.420]  She's covered for later was confirmed.
[40:55.420 --> 40:56.420]  Yes.
[40:56.420 --> 40:59.140]  She's covered for these rapists her entire life.
[40:59.140 --> 41:03.140]  Well, her husband is a hardcore rapist.
[41:03.140 --> 41:04.740]  He's an expert rapist.
[41:04.740 --> 41:05.740]  So now she wants him.
[41:05.740 --> 41:09.460]  In the settled cases, he bites the women with blood dripping, holding them down, biting
[41:09.460 --> 41:11.220]  their lips while he rapes them.
[41:11.220 --> 41:14.380]  Well, this young girl was left infertile.
[41:14.380 --> 41:16.180]  She was, it was not just a rape.
[41:16.180 --> 41:17.180]  It was very brutal.
[41:17.180 --> 41:19.060]  And so it was a torture rape.
[41:19.060 --> 41:20.060]  Yeah.
[41:20.060 --> 41:22.460]  We're going to be hearing more about that, but that's just the amazing thing.
[41:22.460 --> 41:23.460]  It's the character.
[41:23.460 --> 41:24.660]  Well, listen, you're not a good feminist.
[41:24.660 --> 41:26.460]  I mean, whatever Hillary does, it's good.
[41:26.460 --> 41:30.980]  They're going to have a hard time demonizing this 13 year old girl like they did the other
[41:30.980 --> 41:31.980]  women who came forward.
[41:31.980 --> 41:35.780]  They all just dismissed them as one bimbo slut after the other and attacked them individually.
[41:35.780 --> 41:38.540]  They're going to have a hard time doing this with a 13 year old girl.
[41:38.540 --> 41:42.580]  And now that they've got this tape of Hillary, that's pretty amazing.
[41:42.580 --> 41:43.580]  When you hear that, it's very chill.
[41:43.580 --> 41:45.060]  Why are you being racist?
[41:45.060 --> 41:50.660]  Now, I tell you what, it's just, you know, the sad thing too, Alex, you're talking about
[41:50.660 --> 41:51.660]  people waking up.
[41:51.660 --> 41:57.220]  They spent more time in that line with people who were hardcore Hillary and Obama support.
[41:57.220 --> 42:00.660]  And they were talking, you know, at one point there's a little girl looking through a book
[42:00.660 --> 42:04.900]  and she sees something about some woman that was labeled as a murder or whatever.
[42:04.900 --> 42:08.620]  This other lady says, well, remember they're innocent until proven guilty.
[42:08.620 --> 42:12.180]  They have some of the right core values.
[42:12.180 --> 42:17.300]  It's just that they are so into this club of the Democrats or the Republicans.
[42:17.300 --> 42:20.820]  They're following these people because of their identity, whether they're black or they're
[42:20.820 --> 42:21.820]  a woman or whatever.
[42:21.820 --> 42:23.460]  Well, it's mindless.
[42:23.460 --> 42:24.460]  It's mindless jingoism.
[42:24.460 --> 42:30.820]  It's just, I mean, if you know Hillary, she's a black op commander CIA from college on record.
[42:30.820 --> 42:33.340]  Total forms of evil, narcotics, trafficking at Mina.
[42:33.340 --> 42:37.580]  I've interviewed the multiple pilots, kids being killed that saw it going on, just every
[42:37.580 --> 42:39.740]  form of criminal operation.
[42:39.740 --> 42:41.420]  These are master criminals.
[42:41.420 --> 42:45.100]  They'll dismiss that because she's part of that club or she's the identity that they
[42:45.100 --> 42:46.100]  want to identify with.
[42:46.100 --> 42:47.660]  And I've seen that with Republicans as well.
[42:47.660 --> 42:51.900]  You know, marching locks, lockstep behind a guy who's a pastor, but he wants to start
[42:51.900 --> 42:53.220]  wars all over the place.
[42:53.220 --> 42:57.180]  You know, it's just the get into this club of being in the Republicans or the Democrats.
[42:57.180 --> 42:59.060]  That becomes a big deal to them.
[42:59.060 --> 43:01.340]  It's like supporting their college team or something.
[43:01.340 --> 43:02.340]  And I see just the opposite.
[43:02.340 --> 43:06.060]  When I was involved in the Libertarian Party, they were so much against the cult of personality
[43:06.060 --> 43:09.780]  that they would go down and analyze everybody's positions or the fine tooth coma if they disagreed
[43:09.780 --> 43:13.660]  with them on one issue that throw the guy out and win anything.
[43:13.660 --> 43:14.940]  But you know, you got to know, I agree.
[43:14.940 --> 43:19.900]  And listen, I've always attacked the Republicans because they're a bunch of blue blood scum,
[43:19.900 --> 43:21.140]  Chris Christie, the rest of them.
[43:21.140 --> 43:25.180]  But I mean, I've studied politics, I studied history.
[43:25.180 --> 43:30.580]  I mean, it's been a hobby and this is beginning to really reach collegial level.
[43:30.580 --> 43:37.100]  No one's ever put up with a government paying for the homeless kids to come here and causing
[43:37.100 --> 43:40.860]  a mass flood and letting you in a republic.
[43:40.860 --> 43:43.980]  They break the law, openly break the law and then as you're talking about, they don't
[43:43.980 --> 43:47.980]  allow people to take photographs of the laws being broken down at the border.
[43:47.980 --> 43:52.020]  If you expose their criminal actions as a whistleblower, you are now the criminal.
[43:52.020 --> 43:53.020]  We see this all the time.
[43:53.020 --> 43:56.620]  Every time we go to talk to somebody anymore, we have to go in covertly because they won't
[43:56.620 --> 43:58.500]  have an upfront discussion with you.
[43:58.500 --> 44:01.260]  They want you to repeat what they have to say.
[44:01.260 --> 44:02.900]  We want to report what's going on.
[44:02.900 --> 44:06.820]  And by the way, you notice now, finally the press corps figuring this out that honest
[44:06.820 --> 44:11.180]  for media, it's too late, you know, the media are already hit, you know, they're already
[44:11.180 --> 44:12.180]  dying.
[44:12.180 --> 44:16.100]  They're already losing their jobs, it's over, you know, drugs told them in 99 in the speech
[44:16.100 --> 44:18.940]  it was even earlier, you know, you in a decade, you're all going to be losing your jobs.
[44:18.940 --> 44:19.940]  They all laughed.
[44:19.940 --> 44:24.820]  They still are a little bit arrogant, but they don't seem to understand that or they're
[44:24.820 --> 44:28.100]  just starting to that now they're getting rid of the press conferences altogether.
[44:28.100 --> 44:29.100]  Yeah.
[44:29.100 --> 44:32.500]  I mean, why they'll just have the news network repeat whatever they said, you don't even
[44:32.500 --> 44:33.500]  need to be there.
[44:33.500 --> 44:37.900]  The prop of having that reporter there to act like they were asking questions, I learned
[44:37.900 --> 44:43.260]  this years ago, the New York Times would just call me up or you name it, just to do an interview
[44:43.260 --> 44:46.740]  to act like they talked to me to then twist what I said.
[44:46.740 --> 44:50.740]  So I got to where now they call up and I just go, no, I don't want to talk to GQ and they
[44:50.740 --> 44:51.740]  go, we're GQ.
[44:51.740 --> 44:53.740]  And I go, go piss up a rope, man.
[44:53.740 --> 44:54.740]  I don't want to talk to you.
[44:54.740 --> 44:55.740]  Go to hell.
[44:55.740 --> 44:56.740]  I hang the phone up.
[44:56.740 --> 44:59.460]  We'll be right back.
[44:59.460 --> 45:04.820]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more
[45:04.820 --> 45:08.900]  toxic each and every day, but it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[45:08.900 --> 45:12.980]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants
[45:12.980 --> 45:18.380]  than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals
[45:18.380 --> 45:19.380]  within their homes.
[45:19.380 --> 45:23.860]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States, well over a thousand types
[45:23.860 --> 45:26.780]  of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[45:26.780 --> 45:30.260]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic
[45:30.260 --> 45:31.260]  to as well.
[45:31.260 --> 45:35.380]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing
[45:35.380 --> 45:40.580]  my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape until we can fight back
[45:40.580 --> 45:41.580]  against.
[45:41.580 --> 45:45.660]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the U.S.A.
[45:45.660 --> 45:50.100]  The new Info Wars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought
[45:50.100 --> 45:52.180]  with you throughout any toxic environment.

[45:57.980 --> 46:02.180]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Groot.
[46:02.180 --> 46:07.820]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity
[46:07.820 --> 46:09.620]  iodine available.
[46:09.620 --> 46:18.020]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine
[46:18.020 --> 46:20.420]  environmentally clean conditions.
[46:20.420 --> 46:28.620]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit
[46:28.620 --> 46:30.420]  deep in the earth.
[46:30.420 --> 46:34.460]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[46:34.460 --> 46:38.740]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[46:38.740 --> 46:43.140]  Experience the new formula, experience the ancient purity.
[46:43.140 --> 46:49.180]  Shield your family, Survival Shield X2, available now at infowarslife.com.

[46:56.820 --> 47:00.860]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[47:00.860 --> 47:06.460]  Supermail vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead
[47:06.460 --> 47:12.060]  of using synthetic chemicals sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the
[47:12.060 --> 47:15.940]  planet and then concentrated or maximum potency.
[47:15.940 --> 47:20.700]  I just received my mail vitality about three days ago and I must say that was good stuff.
[47:20.700 --> 47:25.020]  African consultant top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed
[47:25.020 --> 47:31.500]  what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super mail vitality formula.
[47:31.500 --> 47:37.020]  Super mail vitality by infowarslife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended
[47:37.020 --> 47:38.020]  dose.
[47:38.020 --> 47:40.220]  I jump out of the bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[47:40.220 --> 47:44.140]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super mail vitality and get the day started.

[47:57.300 --> 48:02.220]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[48:02.220 --> 48:06.620]  This year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[48:06.620 --> 48:10.220]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[48:10.220 --> 48:13.180]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[48:13.180 --> 48:17.060]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect
[48:17.060 --> 48:20.780]  you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[48:20.780 --> 48:24.660]  On average the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[48:24.660 --> 48:29.260]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[48:29.260 --> 48:34.260]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[48:34.260 --> 48:38.700]  Fluoride is in teats and coffins and waters and breads and toothpaste.
[48:38.700 --> 48:41.740]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[48:41.740 --> 48:43.300]  The establishment is not going to do it.
[48:43.300 --> 48:46.660]  It's time to take action, it's time to filter our water.

[49:23.380 --> 49:30.500]  We're going to play in the next hour the emergency manager of McAllen, Texas, saying
[49:30.500 --> 49:36.220]  that over 90% of the illegals that come in are on buses, families, kids, babies, you
[49:36.220 --> 49:42.460]  name it, the board patrol who said that they're filling the formula and heating the formula
[49:42.460 --> 49:44.020]  and changing diapers as their new jobs.
[49:44.020 --> 49:48.980]  The head of the board patrol union said that a week and a half ago.
[49:48.980 --> 49:52.300]  So we're not demonizing the board patrol individually, but it doesn't matter because they're following
[49:52.300 --> 49:54.300]  orders.
[49:54.300 --> 49:55.940]  So we don't individually, we're not mad at them.
[49:55.940 --> 49:56.940]  We know they're being destroyed.
[49:56.940 --> 49:58.740]  A lot of them are quitting.
[49:58.740 --> 50:03.780]  We've broke that new story with an ice agent that talked to us and that became a national
[50:03.780 --> 50:08.300]  news story last week with our reporters down on the border and just every day, new stuff
[50:08.300 --> 50:09.300]  breaks.
[50:09.300 --> 50:13.500]  But he said, no, about 90 plus percent, we're going to play the audio and the video, your
[50:13.500 --> 50:17.980]  TV viewer, have been given vouchers to go wherever they want in the country.
[50:17.980 --> 50:21.740]  They're illegals.
[50:21.740 --> 50:25.620]  They just bust them a quote to their families that live in the quote interior.
[50:25.620 --> 50:28.180]  And again, that's completely illegal.
[50:28.180 --> 50:33.060]  And they're just doing it and telling Breitbart and Info Wars, hey, you can't be here.
[50:33.060 --> 50:38.460]  You're standing there in McAllen or in Brownsville on the side of the street where the big bridge
[50:38.460 --> 50:39.460]  is.
[50:39.460 --> 50:43.820]  And there's people wandering around with bags and selling oranges a hundred yards away.
[50:43.820 --> 50:48.700]  They come over and see that you're an American press with a flag on your microphone.
[50:48.700 --> 50:51.900]  And they say, get out of here.
[50:51.900 --> 50:53.460]  And they know that they're breaking the law.
[50:53.460 --> 50:54.460]  They don't want it documented.
[50:54.460 --> 50:57.660]  It's just like when a cop is doing something wrong, he doesn't want you to take his picture
[50:57.660 --> 50:59.020]  and get in their face.
[50:59.020 --> 51:00.580]  That's what's happening everywhere.
[51:00.580 --> 51:03.820]  They don't want anybody to see what they're doing, even though they're doing it in broad
[51:03.820 --> 51:05.540]  daylight and taking down the facade.
[51:05.540 --> 51:09.940]  Well, the press has to stand up against this, not just the dying dinosaur press, but the
[51:09.940 --> 51:15.900]  general public has to realize that get a camera, get a microphone, you can get it for
[51:15.900 --> 51:21.060]  like 300 bucks, go down to the border or whatever your issue is, cover it, put it on YouTube,
[51:21.060 --> 51:22.420]  it will become news.
[51:22.420 --> 51:27.780]  And more and more people are doing that and totally destroying the dinosaur press that
[51:27.780 --> 51:28.940]  won't do their job.
[51:28.940 --> 51:30.940]  We're filling that vacuum.
[51:30.940 --> 51:35.820]  And sure, I came along in one of the earlier waves of new media and I'm now long in the
[51:35.820 --> 51:41.340]  tooth at this and more professional, but people didn't tune in because I was professional.
[51:41.340 --> 51:46.140]  They tuned in because it was real and they kept seeing what I talked about come through.
[51:46.140 --> 51:47.140]  Yeah.
[51:47.140 --> 51:48.140]  Yeah.
[51:48.140 --> 51:49.140]  They're going to shut that down though.
[51:49.140 --> 51:53.340]  They've got Apple had patents for that back in 2008 to be able to selectively shut down
[51:53.340 --> 51:55.540]  a phone or all the phones in a particular area.
[51:55.540 --> 51:59.780]  And now all droids will have it where the police hit one button and everything turns
[51:59.780 --> 52:00.780]  off.
[52:00.780 --> 52:01.780]  That's right.
[52:01.780 --> 52:02.780]  Remote control access.
[52:02.780 --> 52:03.780]  That's right.
[52:03.780 --> 52:04.780]  Beyond the NSA.
[52:04.780 --> 52:05.780]  Yeah.
[52:05.780 --> 52:07.860]  So, but you'll still be able to do it if you get a purpose built small phone if they
[52:07.860 --> 52:11.740]  still camera, if they still sell those or GoPro or something like that.
[52:11.740 --> 52:14.380]  But again, it's designed to shut down human communication.
[52:14.380 --> 52:15.380]  Yeah.
[52:15.380 --> 52:16.380]  Oh yeah.
[52:16.380 --> 52:17.380]  Yeah.
[52:17.380 --> 52:18.380]  It shows and they're just doing it.
[52:18.380 --> 52:19.380]  Listen, last week was in the news.
[52:19.380 --> 52:24.100]  Obama met with the chiefs of police and it was, you know, closed doors and several articles
[52:24.100 --> 52:25.100]  about it.
[52:25.100 --> 52:29.420]  But reportedly said, don't tell the public what we've got and we're listening to everything.
[52:29.420 --> 52:30.940]  The average cop doesn't know that.
[52:30.940 --> 52:31.940]  It's higher up.
[52:31.940 --> 52:36.220]  I mean, this is the end of everything, especially because crooks are running at all.
[52:36.220 --> 52:37.220]  That's right.
[52:37.220 --> 52:40.900]  And it also is a policy that starts at the very top, just like we saw Hillary Clinton.
[52:40.900 --> 52:44.820]  She's saying that people who have viewpoints are terrorizing other people when it comes
[52:44.820 --> 52:45.820]  to the Second Amendment.
[52:45.820 --> 52:50.820]  So, your opinion, your First Amendment rights are now terrorizing people and that's just
[52:50.820 --> 52:54.700]  one step away from what Harry Reid said when he started calling people terrorists.
[52:54.700 --> 52:57.780]  And we ought to take that seriously because these are the people who are coming up with
[52:57.780 --> 53:00.860]  these draconian measures, suspending the rule of law.
[53:00.860 --> 53:01.860]  Absolutely.
[53:01.860 --> 53:04.860]  Look, they haven't dropped the hammer yet, but they're putting the framework in.
[53:04.860 --> 53:07.860]  They're using the rhetoric they're about to do it.
[53:07.860 --> 53:10.900]  They're about to really go into high gear, but they've already been implementing things
[53:10.900 --> 53:12.060]  that are just unheard of.
[53:12.060 --> 53:13.060]  Oh, yeah.
[53:13.060 --> 53:14.420]  I mean, you can see they're committed.
[53:14.420 --> 53:19.700]  And the way Hillary looked at you with pure hate, there's a still shot up on infowars.com.
[53:19.700 --> 53:22.740]  People got to go see the image in the article titled Hillary Clinton Attacks Drudge and
[53:22.740 --> 53:25.100]  Second Amendment in Texas Visit.
[53:25.100 --> 53:28.580]  I mean, she gave you a go to Haiti's look.
[53:28.580 --> 53:29.580]  Yeah.
[53:29.580 --> 53:33.180]  Well, you know, the thing is, she's saying that you can't intimidate people.
[53:33.180 --> 53:36.420]  And yet, does she think that it's intimidating people to call them terrorists?
[53:36.420 --> 53:38.820]  I mean, that's essentially what she's doing.
[53:38.820 --> 53:40.100]  She's trying to shut that down.
[53:40.100 --> 53:43.620]  Our rights don't rest on whether or not the majority of people like them.
[53:43.620 --> 53:44.900]  They don't have the authority.
[53:44.900 --> 53:49.020]  The majority of people do not have the authority to take away our rights, neither do the courts
[53:49.020 --> 53:50.020]  or the legions.
[53:50.020 --> 53:51.020]  That's right.
[53:51.020 --> 53:56.060]  In a republic, if 51% say make black people slaves again, no, you can't because it's against
[53:56.060 --> 53:57.060]  the bill of rights.
[53:57.060 --> 53:58.060]  That's right.
[53:58.060 --> 54:00.300]  So legally, they would have to change the Constitution.
[54:00.300 --> 54:01.300]  They don't want to do that.
[54:01.300 --> 54:04.580]  They don't want to go through the process that the Constitution says you have to go
[54:04.580 --> 54:06.500]  through to change the Constitution.
[54:06.500 --> 54:10.060]  And they want to enact, even if they were to do that, it would still be...
[54:10.060 --> 54:13.940]  Well, notice, they're doing all this just by fiat criminal operation.
[54:13.940 --> 54:20.260]  There's not even documents that they're giving them vouchers until we dug them up.
[54:20.260 --> 54:23.900]  And then, you know, we're talking to the emergency manager and he goes, I don't know the authority.
[54:23.900 --> 54:27.860]  It's just, we're here and now the board of patrol ships he legals in, gives them food
[54:27.860 --> 54:32.140]  and pays to ship them to be dropped off on street corners, wherever they ask.
[54:32.140 --> 54:37.100]  Well, the former board of patrol union said that this is a deliberate policy.
[54:37.100 --> 54:38.860]  It's orchestrated for political purposes.
[54:38.860 --> 54:39.860]  We know...
[54:39.860 --> 54:40.860]  Of course it is.
[54:40.860 --> 54:42.340]  It's a cloud and pivot thing, as you said, all along.
[54:42.340 --> 54:46.540]  And it's also a way for Obama to speed up and accelerate his youth core.
[54:46.540 --> 54:48.540]  They already had the FEMA youth core.
[54:48.540 --> 54:52.580]  If the government raises these kids and treats them like royalty as we see them doing, already
[54:52.580 --> 54:53.860]  they're treating them better than they do them.
[54:53.860 --> 54:55.660]  That's the target age, 14.
[54:55.660 --> 54:56.660]  That's right.
[54:56.660 --> 54:59.260]  They have these kids, they treat them great.
[54:59.260 --> 55:02.540]  Now these kids have this unswerving, undying loyalty to the government.
[55:02.540 --> 55:03.540]  And they're not even Americans.
[55:03.540 --> 55:04.540]  That's right.
[55:04.540 --> 55:05.540]  This is a classic takeover.
[55:05.540 --> 55:06.540]  Perfect.
[55:06.540 --> 55:07.540]  Yeah, it's a perfect way.
[55:07.540 --> 55:11.500]  I mean, this is a rerun of like hundreds of other tyrannies I've studied, all mixed
[55:11.500 --> 55:12.500]  together.
[55:12.500 --> 55:15.740]  And you find out, oh, they hired the former head of the Stasi, Marcus Wolfe, paid him
[55:15.740 --> 55:22.540]  a million won for two years before he died in 2003 to help set up the current Homeland
[55:22.540 --> 55:23.540]  Security.
[55:23.540 --> 55:24.540]  And again, that was bipartisan.
[55:24.540 --> 55:30.100]  It was William Benny, who was one of the first NSA whistleblowers, the highest ranking whistleblower.
[55:30.100 --> 55:33.180]  He was technical head with global responsibilities.
[55:33.180 --> 55:36.500]  And he said on this program, they're essentially doing the same thing in this country that he
[55:36.500 --> 55:39.380]  saw happening in East Germany and Russia.
[55:39.380 --> 55:42.180]  When he was working there, he was monitoring these foreign countries.
[55:42.180 --> 55:44.860]  Now he says they're taking all that and bringing it in.
[55:44.860 --> 55:45.860]  And that was...
[55:45.860 --> 55:46.860]  Oh yeah.
[55:46.860 --> 55:50.020]  Listen, I told you, my dad said, hey, I think Homeland Security is trying to set us up.
[55:50.020 --> 55:52.780]  They came in and said they want me to spy on all my patients before he retired last
[55:52.780 --> 55:53.780]  year.
[55:53.780 --> 55:56.460]  And I said, no, dad, they're doing it with most physicians.
[55:56.460 --> 55:59.500]  I said, go check with other doctors.
[55:59.500 --> 56:03.420]  And he went, wow, almost all of the senior ones have been visited either at their offices
[56:03.420 --> 56:04.500]  or at home.
[56:04.500 --> 56:11.780]  In some cases, by FBI, you name it, or sometimes by auxiliary groups of basically the Democratic
[56:11.780 --> 56:12.780]  Party.
[56:12.780 --> 56:13.780]  So see, they're merging it.
[56:13.780 --> 56:19.940]  Once they get these auxiliary agents that are party officials, it's outside of the FBI,
[56:19.940 --> 56:20.940]  outside the police.
[56:20.940 --> 56:21.940]  That's what the youth corps is.
[56:21.940 --> 56:25.100]  They need a domestic security force just as big, just as strong as our military.
[56:25.100 --> 56:28.020]  Close quote, Obama 2008, they're in the campaign.
[56:28.020 --> 56:30.940]  They're just doing it by fiat.
[56:30.940 --> 56:33.300]  They're just moving ahead.
[56:33.300 --> 56:34.300]  It's unbelievable.
[56:34.300 --> 56:35.860]  How do you think they're going to try to get away with it?
[56:35.860 --> 56:40.620]  I want to play these clips of Hillary basically saying free speech is not terrorism.
[56:40.620 --> 56:45.980]  Well, they're just coming out with it to a greater extent and not backing off when it's
[56:45.980 --> 56:46.980]  discovered.
[56:46.980 --> 56:47.980]  Look at the IRS scandal, for example.
[56:47.980 --> 56:49.860]  Nixon was accused of doing that.
[56:49.860 --> 56:53.540]  That led, it was one of the key articles of his impeachment, others being the fact that
[56:53.540 --> 56:57.340]  he refused to give information to the Congress when it was investigating him.
[56:57.340 --> 57:00.300]  And yet they do it now to a far greater extent.
[57:00.300 --> 57:04.580]  And then when somebody calls him on it, they just push back and say, you know, do something
[57:04.580 --> 57:05.580]  about it.
[57:05.580 --> 57:06.580]  We're not going to comply.
[57:06.580 --> 57:09.980]  We're not going to be ashamed of the fact that we broke the law.
[57:09.980 --> 57:11.900]  When they get caught, they don't care.
[57:11.900 --> 57:16.260]  So it's just like when you see police brutalizing people, they're being encouraged to do that
[57:16.260 --> 57:17.700]  by the federal government.
[57:17.700 --> 57:20.900]  The message is sent, keep doing that.
[57:20.900 --> 57:27.540]  Just in case you think we're making this up, here is Hillary on CNN following the script.
[57:27.540 --> 57:31.420]  It's not just her saying it, that speech is terrorizing people, that we're defending
[57:31.420 --> 57:32.420]  the right to have guns.
[57:32.420 --> 57:37.340]  Well, that's just causing an epidemic of shootings when they're down 52% in their
[57:37.340 --> 57:38.340]  own numbers.
[57:38.340 --> 57:42.980]  I mean, they know, just the department knows, since 92, shootings are down 52%.
[57:42.980 --> 57:43.980]  They know that.
[57:43.980 --> 57:47.580]  They know mass shootings are flat, but they put the lie out.
[57:47.580 --> 57:50.940]  Here is Hillary on the Communist News Network.
[57:50.940 --> 57:55.500]  I'm well aware that this is a hot political subject.
[57:55.500 --> 58:00.500]  And again, I will speak out no matter what role I find myself in, but I believe that
[58:00.500 --> 58:03.260]  we need a more thoughtful conversation.
[58:03.260 --> 58:10.100]  We cannot let a minority of people, and it's that's what it is, minority of people, hold
[58:10.100 --> 58:16.220]  a viewpoint that terrorizes the majority of people, hold a viewpoint.
[58:16.220 --> 58:21.100]  Remember the governor of New York said, if you're pro-gun or pro-life, get out of the
[58:21.100 --> 58:22.100]  state.
[58:22.100 --> 58:23.900]  And he was like, no, I'm serious, get out.
[58:23.900 --> 58:25.980]  Well, that sounds real liberal.
[58:25.980 --> 58:26.980]  Do what we say.
[58:26.980 --> 58:29.340]  We can't allow you to have a view.
[58:29.340 --> 58:34.460]  The bill of rights was set up to protect the smallest minority, that is, the individual.
[58:34.460 --> 58:37.100]  It was set there to make sure that we have the right...
[58:37.100 --> 58:40.220]  Because there's always special interest that overpower the individual.
[58:40.220 --> 58:41.940]  So this was set up for individuals.
[58:41.940 --> 58:42.940]  Exactly.
[58:42.940 --> 58:44.500]  And these are rights that we already had.
[58:44.500 --> 58:47.340]  We're just recognized and said to the government, you will not...
[58:47.340 --> 58:48.580]  But plus, he's lying.
[58:48.580 --> 58:52.300]  Congress has a 7% approval rating in the latest Gallup poll.
[58:52.300 --> 58:53.700]  They have no legitimacy.
[58:53.700 --> 58:54.700]  That's right.
[58:54.700 --> 58:57.300]  Except for a handful of the political class.
[58:57.300 --> 58:58.300]  That's right.
[58:58.300 --> 59:02.540]  So, you know, it's just amazing that they would do this, but people need to understand.
[59:02.540 --> 59:06.500]  People on the left need to understand that the same people that are going to deny rights
[59:06.500 --> 59:08.580]  in one area are going to deny them everywhere.
[59:08.580 --> 59:11.580]  They're going to say, you don't have any amendment rights, you don't have a fifth amendment
[59:11.580 --> 59:14.020]  rights, you don't have any first amendment rights.
[59:14.020 --> 59:15.020]  And that's what you...
[59:15.020 --> 59:18.540]  Well, look at how the Republican Democratic leadership are in lockstep when it comes to
[59:18.540 --> 59:22.220]  NSA, police states, the billions of bullets, training for war.
[59:22.220 --> 59:25.140]  But again, why have I totally endorsed the real Tea Party now?
[59:25.140 --> 59:28.860]  The Republicans couldn't take it over, the leadership's trying to kill it, the Democrats
[59:28.860 --> 59:32.920]  are coming after it, all the big trade federations are coming after it, trying to strangle it.
[59:32.920 --> 59:37.100]  Because it is the only venue of revolution in this country right now.
[59:37.100 --> 59:42.980]  We have to put the full energy behind it now, second hour, tons of key intel.
[59:42.980 --> 59:47.820]  Obama's saying he wants a gunband and more coming up, second hour, till friends are found
[59:47.820 --> 59:48.820]  to tune in.
[59:48.820 --> 59:53.540]  Man, when I get home from work, all Betty does is watch her reality TV, and then she
[59:53.540 --> 59:54.540]  goes to sleep.
[59:54.540 --> 59:59.060]  I can take her on romantic dates, I get her flowers, you name it, she's just not the woman
[59:59.060 --> 01:00:00.060]  I married.
[01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:02.220]  Oh, Ralph, that's just awful.
[01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:03.780]  Does this seem familiar?
[01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:07.100]  Are the honeymoon days of your relationship long gone?
[01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:12.940]  If so, consider this, the abundance of chemical additives, pesticides, BPA containers.
[01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:18.260]  Contaminated tap water, and other toxic substances found in our environment.
[01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:22.140]  Experts know our bodies are suffering and being thrown off balance, especially when
[01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:24.660]  it comes to your natural systems.
[01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:26.580]  Forget synthetic chemicals.

[01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:33.940]  the use of phony additives.

[01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:52.980]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so
[01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:55.900]  much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:00:55.900 --> 01:01:00.660]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:05.020]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:08.180]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:13.580]  You now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:17.460]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come
[01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:23.340]  out with rare earth, deep earth crystals, and the results that I personally have had
[01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:25.500]  have been life changing.
[01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:30.380]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:35.340]  This is innovating, and the best part is it helps fund infowars.com, the radio show, the
[01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:39.780]  TV show, the whole media operation, promoting true libertarian ideas, for a limited time
[01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:43.260]  experience the ancient power of survival shield X2.

[01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:54.220]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[01:01:54.220 --> 01:02:01.140]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:07.700]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:14.300]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:21.940]  By the way, if you're listening in Mexico or Guatemala or Latin America and want to
[01:02:21.940 --> 01:02:27.660]  call in, whether you're an expat or you live there, and you want to call me out for saying
[01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:31.860]  it's wrong that Obama advertises to the world, you know, if you're sick, you don't have a
[01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:37.420]  job, you're hurt, you know, your little kids come here, we'll pay for it.
[01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:40.420]  And by the way, they come out over the weekend and Democrats admit, oh, we are kind of encouraging
[01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:41.420]  it.
[01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:42.420]  I'd like to hear from you.
[01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:46.460]  I'd like to hear from folks on the border states, people down by the border, I mean,
[01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:50.540]  it looks like a blighted war zone in South Texas on the border compared to what it looked
[01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:54.580]  like when I was in even college or high school, it was really cool down there.
[01:02:54.580 --> 01:02:58.780]  Really great museums, great food, great people on both sides of the border.
[01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:10.780]  It now resembles Calcutta meets Gaza or, you know, bombed out city, boarded up everything,
[01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:14.700]  burned out cars, and I mean, Mexico's collapsing.
[01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:18.300]  And so I'm supposed to just collapse with it because the globalists have this plan.
[01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:21.980]  I want to get into Wesley Clark, but you might have to run over to your office and pull that
[01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:24.660]  one and telegraph article you covered on the Mountain News this week.
[01:03:24.660 --> 01:03:27.100]  I think that's key to tie into this with Kitt.
[01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:29.980]  So maybe we can try to print that off.
[01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:30.980]  What was the headline?
[01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:31.980]  I don't remember.
[01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:33.820]  I'll have to go back and take a look at it.
[01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:37.740]  But you know what you're talking about with all this, the problems that are going to
[01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:42.580]  blight in Mexico and now coming into the U.S., that's really the war that's going on there.
[01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:45.860]  You know, they want to talk about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq that they started.
[01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:48.820]  What about this war that they started, the drug war that they started in Mexico?
[01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:49.820]  Well, if somebody...
[01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:53.260]  I mean, thousands of people dying, I mean, that is worse in terms of casualties than
[01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:54.260]  Afghanistan.
[01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:58.700]  Yeah, in fact, I keep saying 70,000, 70,000 years go by like minutes now.
[01:03:58.700 --> 01:04:00.620]  That was like three, four years ago.
[01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:04.060]  And this weekend, I looked it up, as I saw it on the news, they said over 100,000 dead
[01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:05.060]  the last six years.
[01:04:05.060 --> 01:04:06.060]  Yes.
[01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:07.060]  And I looked it up.
[01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:08.900]  It's like 130,000 dead.
[01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:11.620]  I mean, more die than Vietnam.
[01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:12.620]  Yes.
[01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:16.380]  And yet that is because of our drug prohibition war.
[01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:20.940]  That's what we've pushed down into Mexico and Central and South America.
[01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:22.860]  Prohibition didn't work with alcohol.
[01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:24.020]  Prohibition wrecked this country.
[01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:25.020]  Exactly.
[01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:26.580]  And so now it's been going on for decades.
[01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:31.020]  We've been pushing it down rather than stop that plague, that war that we've inflicted
[01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:33.020]  on Central and South America.
[01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:37.060]  We're telling the people now to come into this country because it is a politically designed
[01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:38.060]  takedown.
[01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:42.580]  And Petraeus was speaking at this Margaret Thatcher group, which is the opposite.
[01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:46.060]  She helped stop the total takeover of England under the EU.
[01:04:46.060 --> 01:04:49.100]  After it got done, and I'm not lionizing her, but she did kill that.
[01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:50.100]  Yeah.
[01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:53.660]  And here they are at this Margaret Thatcher society, and it's in the newspaper saying,
[01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:56.060]  oh, the open borders are about North American Union.
[01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:57.060]  Yeah.
[01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:58.060]  Well, of course it is.
[01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:01.100]  Well, Petraeus, the question was, after America, what's next?
[01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:02.700]  And he said, well, that's simple.
[01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:03.700]  North America.
[01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:07.820]  So he, and the whole time he's talking about NAFTA and the conjunction of Mexico.
[01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:13.060]  If you go to the BAMP Canada 2007 documents that are in in-game, the judicial law student
[01:05:13.060 --> 01:05:16.380]  God, it says, we will integrate through stealth and crisis.
[01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:17.380]  That's a quote.
[01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:21.540]  And they said, the crisis will be a giant immigration wave collapsing the borders.
[01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:24.060]  We will also try to use the flu and terrorism.
[01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:25.060]  Yeah.
[01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:26.060]  Yeah.
[01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:27.060]  That's what they're doing.
[01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:28.580]  That's what they're rolling out the plan right now.
[01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:30.060]  And we have their battle plan.
[01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:31.060]  Yeah.
[01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:33.500]  As far as they're concerned, they've already set up the legal framework where we don't
[01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:34.940]  have a border, and it's called NAFTA.
[01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:37.620]  And that's what Petraeus was globally talking about.
[01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:39.500]  He had absolutely no problem talking about it.
[01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:44.820]  Even if you, your neighbor dropped their diary on the ground and it was in the wind blowing
[01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:45.820]  around and you went and got it.
[01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:47.740]  You weren't trying to read it, but you saw your name in it.
[01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:50.100]  So you open it, you go in your house, you're kind of embarrassed.
[01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:51.100]  You read it.
[01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:54.620]  And it's like, yeah, I've been planning to kill David for years.
[01:05:54.620 --> 01:05:58.500]  And, you know, I think I'm going to, I think I'm going to, you know, mug him next week
[01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:01.980]  and make it look like a mugging, you know, just to get him back because I don't like
[01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:07.340]  David and, and, and, and, you know, that'll, that'll teach him blah, blah, blah.
[01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:08.540]  You would do something about that.
[01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:09.860]  It's a good analogy.
[01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:14.300]  We have the globalists just openly admitting all this, white house science, our right seco
[01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:15.300]  science.
[01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:16.300]  Yeah.
[01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:19.740]  We put stuff in the water to brain damage and lower your fertility.
[01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:23.420]  And you know, we go down here to Austin, talk to the mayor with scientists, Harvard studies
[01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:25.940]  that fluoride lowers IQ gives you cancer.
[01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:27.100]  He just flips us off.
[01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:28.100]  Yeah.
[01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:32.540]  Mayor just literally says F you and does it flips us off being polite.
[01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:35.980]  They toasted him with the, uh, the people gave him the evidence, gave him a local report
[01:06:35.980 --> 01:06:40.140]  at the local TV station actually did the report, they toasted him and said, huh, here you go.
[01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:42.700]  We're going to keep fluoride in the water because it's all part of their cult because
[01:06:42.700 --> 01:06:46.820]  they know if one thing falls, their whole criminal operation falls and the mayor of
[01:06:46.820 --> 01:06:52.540]  Austin said, F you, we have the video F you, I'm going to poison you, I can do whatever
[01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:53.540]  I want.
[01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:54.540]  You got it.
[01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:55.540]  Scum.
[01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:57.540]  We'll be back with Kit Daniels from the border.
[01:06:57.540 --> 01:07:01.460]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Groot.
[01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:07.140]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity
[01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:08.900]  iodine available.
[01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:17.340]  The new survival shield X2 is mined from seven to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine
[01:07:17.340 --> 01:07:19.740]  environmentally clean conditions.
[01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:27.940]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit
[01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:29.260]  deep in the earth.
[01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:33.740]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:38.060]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:40.180]  Experience the new formula.
[01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:42.420]  Experience the ancient purity.
[01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:43.900]  Shield your family.

[01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:05.860]  You know, I kind of like Obama.
[01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:16.060]  I mean, he did build my business, like, and I like my healthcare costs going up.
[01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:22.540]  Now in Los Angeles, we play the songs that sound more like everyone else than anyone
[01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:23.540]  else.
[01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:30.900]  Hitler took the guns, Stalin took the guns, Mao took the guns, and El Castro took the
[01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:31.900]  guns.
[01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:32.900]  Because they were good people.
[01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:33.900]  They loved government.
[01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:37.860]  1776 will commence again if you try to take the guns.
[01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:40.860]  Harry Reid says that's terrorist talk, I mean, he easily does.
[01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:44.900]  The Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:53.700]  I am sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over
[01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:57.540]  the mind of man.
[01:08:57.540 --> 01:09:01.780]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:06.260]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:11.860]  We're hardcore liberals on this broadcast.
[01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:14.140]  That means like Thomas Jefferson.
[01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:18.980]  But the fake liberals that are a bunch of ultra-fascist criminals wrecking this country
[01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:22.820]  with their rhino blue blood accomplices.
[01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:24.020]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:26.940]  David Nice is going to write a shot again with us the rest of the hour because I love
[01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:31.820]  having him here as my kind of Ed McMahon bouncing info back out at me.
[01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:37.580]  We've got Kit Daniels and of course the intrepid journalist and cameraman and video editor
[01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:43.700]  Rob Jacobson doing a great job down on the border in Brownsville where they've been
[01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:47.780]  told they're not allowed to videotape the illegals on the buses being brought in by
[01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:54.980]  the border patrol and being paid to get on buses and be dropped off inside the interior.
[01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:58.900]  And our reporters are also being told they can't be up against the river, not even on
[01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:00.140]  federal quote property.
[01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:02.340]  Just don't show illegals coming across.
[01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:06.460]  And Breitbart has video of that happening to them as well, US media restricted at border
[01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:08.940]  federal agent site safety concerns.
[01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:12.380]  For your safety, I'm going to stick my hands down your pants at the airport.
[01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:17.780]  For your safety, we're going to do a proctology exam on Jesse Ventura.
[01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:22.300]  For your safety, we're going to naked body scan you while the government funds actual
[01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:29.620]  al-Qaeda all over the world to take over different countries as now not just northern Iraq, but
[01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:35.900]  western Iraq is now falling to a Saudi Arabian al-Qaeda army that flies the Salman bin Laden
[01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:36.900]  flex.
[01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:38.620]  And that's in the German press because they can read it.
[01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:42.620]  So their favorite thing is to say we're up Salman bin Laden brigade one, Salman bin Laden
[01:10:42.620 --> 01:10:47.500]  late brigade two, it's black flags in Arabic saying which you know bin Laden group or which
[01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:53.780]  Wahhabis group they're part of and Obama's setting up a command threat fusion center
[01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:57.980]  to help coordinate with the Iraqi government guaranteed to get all the Iraqi military's
[01:10:57.980 --> 01:11:00.740]  data and give it right to al-Qaeda.
[01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:02.820]  And of course that's come out as well.
[01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:04.780]  So that's how this works.
[01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:08.620]  But again, we're all suspects here in America in the Tea Party of the New Terrorist.
[01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:11.620]  But we're going to get Daniels here in a moment to the bottom of the hour.
[01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:13.300]  And then David, you're going to come back.
[01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:18.420]  We've got a bunch of news on Hillary, a new tape, her laughing about protecting child
[01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:19.420]  rapist.
[01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:21.580]  And she just really is celebrating it.
[01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:25.540]  And this is a real tape and it just shows the pure evil that we're dealing with.
[01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:26.780]  And what else are you going to be covering?
[01:11:26.780 --> 01:11:30.300]  Well, we're also going to talk about how they're covering for her with Benghazi.
[01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:31.980]  You know, that's a big problem.
[01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:34.980]  I mean, it's not just what we're talking about, what we've heard.
[01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:36.660]  Again, al-Qaeda murdering people.
[01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:37.660]  Exactly.
[01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:38.660]  That was al-Qaeda.
[01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:42.620]  And we've heard from Pechenik and others that this was an arms deal.
[01:11:42.620 --> 01:11:46.060]  This was something that was going on between two different groups within the CIA.
[01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:48.180]  There was an international fighting going on.
[01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:53.060]  But just at the superficial level, this lying about the fact that it was a reaction to a
[01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:54.060]  film.
[01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:55.060]  Now they've got a book that's coming out.
[01:11:55.060 --> 01:11:59.140]  A guy, Ed Klein, wrote this book that he's pushing called Blood Feud between the Clintons
[01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:00.140]  and the Obamas.
[01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:04.700]  He's essentially trying to portray her as somebody who she knew that it really wasn't
[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:05.700]  that film.
[01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:09.540]  But she had her arm twisted by Obama into going along with the deception.
[01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:11.140]  Well, I have a problem with that.
[01:12:11.140 --> 01:12:12.140]  You know?
[01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:14.020]  Well, I mean, oh, Hillary Clinton never lies.
[01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:15.020]  You're against women.
[01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:17.580]  People ought to understand this isn't any excuse.
[01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:19.860]  I mean, this is the best excuse they can come up with.
[01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:20.860]  Well, she's the new gimmick.
[01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:21.860]  Yeah.
[01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:25.420]  You know, put a guy who claims he's part African in and then he can destroy the whole Bill
[01:12:25.420 --> 01:12:27.140]  of Rights of Constitution because it's trendy.
[01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:29.380]  Well, now it's the woman thing.
[01:12:29.380 --> 01:12:31.180]  She'll show those guys.
[01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:32.180]  It's just pure gimmicks.
[01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:38.860]  And if Americans want to buy into this, folks, can you imagine if Hillary actually gets in?
[01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:44.500]  Is tyranny any better if it comes to a dressed in a pink polyester pants suit?
[01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:45.500]  You know?
[01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:49.500]  I think if you put Hitler in a pink suit and said it's for the women and said women show
[01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:52.060]  the men that they would probably vote for Hitler.
[01:12:52.060 --> 01:12:56.740]  Well, she's kind of channeling some kind of a supervillain over there in her poster with
[01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:57.740]  those sunglasses.
[01:12:57.740 --> 01:13:02.060]  And by the way, guys, let's show this by a Hillary funded pack all over Austin is putting
[01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:03.060]  these up.
[01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:04.060]  We got one.
[01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:06.060]  It's pound ready is the Twitter meme.
[01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:10.260]  If you're watching an info wars.com, you can see the feet of this in the listen and watch
[01:13:10.260 --> 01:13:11.260]  free link there.
[01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:15.100]  And she literally looks like she's trying to look like the Godfather or something here.
[01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:16.100]  Yeah.
[01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:18.180]  I mean, this is just really bizarre and pathetic.
[01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:19.940]  And then they've got these blue signs up.
[01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:24.220]  She'll turn Texas blue Hillary ready for Hillary dot com.
[01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:25.860]  Boy, is that not disgusting.
[01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:30.860]  They've got that poster of her in the sunglasses and the phone up on the back of the bus, along
[01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:31.860]  with a lecture.
[01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:32.860]  Don't text and drive.
[01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:35.980]  You know, it's like perfect nanny state poster, you know, the car.
[01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:37.980]  Don't say bossy and nanny state.
[01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:40.660]  Hey, not only does Michelle Obama tell your kids what to eat.
[01:13:40.660 --> 01:13:41.660]  Don't complain.
[01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:42.660]  Yeah.
[01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:43.660]  You're not just against women.
[01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:44.660]  You're against black women.
[01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:45.660]  Now.
[01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:50.300]  Well, I'm against control freak criminal weirdos telling me what to do while they feed our
[01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:51.700]  kids prison food.
[01:13:51.700 --> 01:13:56.300]  They have a problem with her with the word bossy, but they put her up there to look like
[01:13:56.300 --> 01:13:57.300]  a boss.
[01:13:57.300 --> 01:14:01.380]  You know, I mean, it's, it looks like a big mother, you know, instead of big brother.
[01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:03.980]  But it is like a fascist or communist poster.
[01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:04.980]  Yeah.
[01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:05.980]  It's more fascist.
[01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:09.700]  The commies usually do that red on blue look, you know, that was the Obama poster.
[01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:14.940]  But I mean, that looks that that literally with the red on the black looks fascist.
[01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:16.620]  That's like a Nazi poster.
[01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:20.900]  Well, and what she says is like a Nazi to when she says that your viewpoints terrorize
[01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:21.900]  people.
[01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:22.900]  So you better shut up.
[01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:26.180]  If you don't think that I should be able to abandon assault weapons.
[01:14:26.180 --> 01:14:28.660]  And there is no definition of what an assault weapon is.
[01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:30.580]  I mean, it's they come at 2% of the crimes.
[01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:31.580]  Yeah.
[01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:32.580]  FBI numbers.
[01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:35.660]  So, you know, if, if 2% of gun crime, if you, if you oppose any of that, if you think
[01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:39.860]  that rights are something that's absolute and shouldn't be infringed around the edges,
[01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:43.820]  say when they infringe on those rights and do it gradually, they essentially turn it
[01:14:43.820 --> 01:14:47.260]  into privileges and they knew when they wrote the second amendment, nobody's going to come
[01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:48.460]  in and take their guns the next day.
[01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:51.060]  They're going to do it with a gradual process of movement.
[01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:53.340]  That's why they talk about, you're not allowed to twist these words.
[01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:57.460]  I want to go to Kit Daniels on the border to give us a preview of what's coming up in
[01:14:57.460 --> 01:14:58.460]  the next segment.
[01:14:58.460 --> 01:15:02.060]  And then again, we'll play the clip of the head emergency manager in McAllen, Major
[01:15:02.060 --> 01:15:06.580]  City, saying, no, I'm here, I run it, the, the feds give them vouchers to go wherever
[01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:07.580]  they want.
[01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:10.260]  Illegal aliens paying to quote, ship them into the interior.
[01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:13.500]  And he's endorsing this basically as his job.
[01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:14.500]  Okay.
[01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:15.500]  So we're going to play that again.
[01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:17.820]  But Kit Daniels, I know the veils will be up later tonight.
[01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:22.180]  You've been working so hard there with Jacobson around the clock, want to commend you for
[01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:23.180]  what you're doing there.
[01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:25.860]  I know it's also dangerous in that area.
[01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:29.460]  You're saying that you guys have run to the same thing Breitbart is, where they're trying
[01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:33.180]  to keep you from documenting what's happening at Daniels from Brownsville.
[01:15:33.180 --> 01:15:35.460]  Yes, sir.
[01:15:35.460 --> 01:15:39.420]  Right now we're seeing the beginnings of a media blackout on the same level as the invasion
[01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:41.980]  of Granada in 1983.
[01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:47.060]  The Breitbart article was the area that it was about 60 miles north to where we're at
[01:15:47.060 --> 01:15:50.620]  right now in Brownsville, about 60 miles, I think northwest.
[01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:51.620]  Yes.
[01:15:51.620 --> 01:15:52.620]  I want you to go there.
[01:15:52.620 --> 01:15:53.620]  Go, go.
[01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:54.620]  Okay.
[01:15:54.620 --> 01:16:00.340]  And we encountered the exact same thing here in Brownsville, Rob Jacobson and I, we drove
[01:16:00.340 --> 01:16:06.340]  on a, we drove into a neighborhood in Brownsville that was about 500 feet from the border.
[01:16:06.340 --> 01:16:10.620]  And all the dirt road, there's one dirt road in particular that we saw that was, looked
[01:16:10.620 --> 01:16:11.620]  like it's typically open.
[01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:13.980]  It was even shown on Google maps that it was open.
[01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:17.380]  It was closed, restricted access only.
[01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:20.260]  And so we drove around the neighborhood and we found another dirt road.
[01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:25.820]  So we took that dirt road and kind of hugged the border, so to speak.
[01:16:25.820 --> 01:16:33.140]  And finally we saw one lone border patrol agent that took a very keen interest in us.
[01:16:33.140 --> 01:16:40.860]  He started, he shifted his SUV into gear, hightailed it, got right on our bumper right
[01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:47.700]  when we were driving back into the neighborhood and he, he rode our bumper for a good five
[01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:51.860]  minutes and it was obvious he's running our license plates.
[01:16:51.860 --> 01:16:56.020]  And I tried to wave him down, you know, talk to him, but you're going to have to go up,
[01:16:56.020 --> 01:16:59.260]  like I said, with the other crew all week and talk to them right in their trucks like
[01:16:59.260 --> 01:17:04.500]  Breitbart did or have them come over and tell you, but that already happened to bound others.
[01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:07.140]  We did get that on video at the major border crossing.
[01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:11.180]  And they said, you know, no, you can't be here again because they don't want the fact
[01:17:11.180 --> 01:17:15.220]  that the crime is being committed to be known by the public.
[01:17:15.220 --> 01:17:19.420]  What else have you learned since you got down there last night that's coming up, kid Daniels?
[01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:25.780]  Well, we tried to get on onto the detention facility for Immigration's Customs Enforcement
[01:17:25.780 --> 01:17:27.380]  and they shut us down.
[01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:32.020]  They turned us away saying, oh, well, we'll give you the number for the media person once
[01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:36.100]  you contact her, but no, no filming of the facility, neither driving up to the guard
[01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:37.100]  or the police.
[01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:39.140]  Yeah, well, they don't have a right to not let you do that or where they commit their
[01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:40.140]  crime set.
[01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:44.180]  Also, I would continue to show what the ICE agent gave us the intel on how they released
[01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:47.700]  the illegals at midnight on the buses so that no one sees it.
[01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:49.580]  Again, they want all this covered up.
[01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:54.620]  The government's not telling folks to come here is to totally collapse it, ladies and
[01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:55.620]  gentlemen.
[01:17:55.620 --> 01:17:59.580]  Our government is engaged in treason, high treason.
[01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:04.980]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more
[01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:09.060]  toxic each and every day, but it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:13.100]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants
[01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:18.500]  than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals
[01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:19.500]  within their homes.
[01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:24.020]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States, well over a thousand types
[01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:26.900]  of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:30.380]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic
[01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:31.380]  to as well.
[01:18:31.380 --> 01:18:35.540]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing
[01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:40.540]  my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight
[01:18:40.540 --> 01:18:41.540]  back against.
[01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:45.820]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the U.S.A.
[01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:50.220]  The new Info Wars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought
[01:18:50.220 --> 01:18:52.340]  with you throughout any toxic environment.

[01:18:58.340 --> 01:19:03.940]  General what do you think about the FBI saying that there is a terror alert on Monday about
[01:19:03.940 --> 01:19:05.620]  a potential for hood situation?
[01:19:05.620 --> 01:19:08.860]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[01:19:08.860 --> 01:19:10.780]  Here we go folks, I'm being a sergeant.
[01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:15.060]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films or the nightly news, Info
[01:19:15.060 --> 01:19:17.020]  Wars is the tip of the spear.
[01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:20.620]  Is this another force flight stage attack to take our civil liberties and promote homelands
[01:19:20.620 --> 01:19:23.140]  security by sticking our hands down on our pants on the streets?
[01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:27.420]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere and that's what
[01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:30.180]  PrisonPlanet.tv is designed to do.
[01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:36.180]  You watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons
[01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:38.500]  against the so-called rebels.
[01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:41.980]  What we see now is a war against reality, it's a war against the truth.
[01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:47.620]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv

[01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:07.500]  Supermail vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead
[01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:13.100]  of using synthetic chemicals sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the
[01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:16.980]  planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:21.740]  I just received my mail vitality about three days ago and I must say that was good stuff.
[01:20:21.740 --> 01:20:26.100]  For consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed
[01:20:26.100 --> 01:20:32.780]  what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic supermail vitality formula.
[01:20:32.780 --> 01:20:38.100]  Supermail vitality by Info War's Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended
[01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:39.100]  dose.
[01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:41.300]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:45.220]  I look forward to waking up and taking my supermail vitality and get the day started.

[01:20:58.460 --> 01:21:03.260]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:21:03.260 --> 01:21:07.700]  This year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:21:07.700 --> 01:21:11.260]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:14.220]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:18.140]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect
[01:21:18.140 --> 01:21:21.820]  you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:21:21.820 --> 01:21:25.820]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:30.340]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:21:30.340 --> 01:21:35.540]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:21:35.540 --> 01:21:39.860]  Fluoride is in teats and coffins and water and breads and toothpaste.
[01:21:39.860 --> 01:21:42.820]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:44.380]  The establishment is not going to do it.
[01:21:44.380 --> 01:21:45.740]  It's time to take action.
[01:21:45.740 --> 01:21:47.740]  It's time to filter our water.

[01:22:04.260 --> 01:22:26.580]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:33.180]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:36.620]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:37.900]  We are the heart of the Resistance.
[01:22:37.900 --> 01:22:38.900]  It's on record.
[01:22:38.900 --> 01:22:40.900]  Texas is the big battleground.
[01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:41.900]  They take Texas.
[01:22:41.900 --> 01:22:42.900]  They get it all.
[01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:43.900]  A second California.
[01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:48.100]  Overrun with the illegals, sworn to vote, basically communist.
[01:22:48.100 --> 01:22:53.260]  With the big megabanks, exempt offshore, crony capitalists controlling communism as the
[01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:55.940]  deployed social control system.
[01:22:55.940 --> 01:23:01.140]  That is the true socioeconomic tech weapon we face, completely different from what the
[01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:04.940]  textbooks or colleges will teach you, but in Carol Quigley's books and other actual
[01:23:04.940 --> 01:23:07.140]  globalist tomes, it's admitted.
[01:23:07.140 --> 01:23:11.900]  Now, if you want to see the video in full, it's up on infowarstore.com.
[01:23:11.900 --> 01:23:15.900]  City official admits, more patrol, fronting cash to bust illegals.
[01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:22.220]  I want to get Kit's take on that and expanding our investigation, but this is the head of
[01:23:22.220 --> 01:23:30.740]  McAllen emergency management, Kevin Pagan, told info wars that 99% of them got off the
[01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:33.740]  board patrol bus at our bus station, had a ticket.
[01:23:33.740 --> 01:23:39.180]  The emergency coordinator for South Texas City stated, and he goes on in these quotes,
[01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:41.140]  is that they basically pay for it.
[01:23:41.140 --> 01:23:48.420]  Then Paul Watson found the day after this broke, the actual federal hiring from January
[01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:53.420]  at FedBizOpps, federal contracts, they have to put those out.
[01:23:53.420 --> 01:23:58.420]  Hiring the people to do this and to quote, bring the kids in with dignity into the interior
[01:23:58.420 --> 01:24:02.420]  in January, and we found the documents FEMA pre-deploying the goods.
[01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:04.940]  I mean, David Knight, this is unbelievable.
[01:24:04.940 --> 01:24:08.980]  I want to play this clip and then get our reporter on the grounds take on this and your
[01:24:08.980 --> 01:24:11.500]  take on it, but here is the clip.
[01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:15.900]  What happened today in particular is that the board of patrol dropped off some, they
[01:24:15.900 --> 01:24:20.740]  call them detainees, but obviously they're not detained after they dropped them off.
[01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:25.300]  And normally they have tickets or arranged transportation to go somewhere in the interior.
[01:24:25.300 --> 01:24:30.540]  Well today, apparently for some logistical reasons, some of them hadn't had transportation
[01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:33.300]  arranged or their transportation is tomorrow.
[01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:34.300]  That's enough.
[01:24:34.300 --> 01:24:35.300]  And so we're ahead.
[01:24:35.300 --> 01:24:36.300]  And it just goes on.
[01:24:36.300 --> 01:24:37.300]  He says they're illegal.
[01:24:37.300 --> 01:24:38.700]  So go watch the full video.
[01:24:38.700 --> 01:24:41.700]  Let's get Kit Daniels take on this and then other new developments.
[01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:44.220]  You're going to be down there for a few days covering this.
[01:24:44.220 --> 01:24:48.380]  We're going to rotate more reporters down there, continuous coverage.
[01:24:48.380 --> 01:24:54.380]  But Kit, what is it like to witness this level of lawlessness personally?
[01:24:54.380 --> 01:24:55.380]  It's unbelievable.
[01:24:55.380 --> 01:24:56.380]  It's bizarre.
[01:24:56.380 --> 01:25:02.140]  Since we've been down here, we've seen maybe 10, 15, even 20 times more border patrol trucks
[01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:06.380]  parked in border patrol stations than we have even seen driving around.
[01:25:06.380 --> 01:25:07.380]  Oh yeah.
[01:25:07.380 --> 01:25:08.380]  I want to add that.
[01:25:08.380 --> 01:25:09.380]  That's the key intel.
[01:25:09.380 --> 01:25:13.060]  I went to Big Ben where I've been 15 times or more in my life.
[01:25:13.060 --> 01:25:14.140]  Always border patrol everywhere.
[01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:21.460]  I went there and saw one border patrol truck one time and that was at the station in Alpine
[01:25:21.460 --> 01:25:25.340]  at 70 miles in and they just waved us and everybody through.
[01:25:25.340 --> 01:25:26.340]  One guy.
[01:25:26.340 --> 01:25:29.020]  It used to be teaming.
[01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:31.020]  That's the story is they're on stand down.
[01:25:31.020 --> 01:25:32.020]  Go show.
[01:25:32.020 --> 01:25:34.220]  We stand down.
[01:25:34.220 --> 01:25:40.260]  And it's funny that one border patrol agent we do encounter is coming after us.
[01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:45.740]  So it just emphasizes the point that border patrol is not meant to, I mean there are good
[01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:46.740]  border patrol agents.
[01:25:46.740 --> 01:25:47.740]  No, no.
[01:25:47.740 --> 01:25:48.740]  They've called us.
[01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:49.740]  They've blown the whistle to us down there in person.
[01:25:49.740 --> 01:25:50.820]  We've blurred their faces out.
[01:25:50.820 --> 01:25:52.980]  They're all quitting because it's over.
[01:25:52.980 --> 01:25:58.540]  The establishment, the very top of border patrol is meant to come after us, the American
[01:25:58.540 --> 01:25:59.540]  citizen.
[01:25:59.540 --> 01:26:01.260]  And that's what we've seen here so far.
[01:26:01.260 --> 01:26:02.260]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:26:02.260 --> 01:26:04.740]  And I've got two reporters here I've invited on and I'm just ranting over everybody because
[01:26:04.740 --> 01:26:05.740]  I'm just freaking out.
[01:26:05.740 --> 01:26:07.460]  Can't continue making your points.
[01:26:07.460 --> 01:26:08.460]  You're there.
[01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:09.460]  See there's so many points.
[01:26:09.460 --> 01:26:13.620]  That's why I get mad and brainstormed is I can't even explain how bad it is, David.
[01:26:13.620 --> 01:26:14.620]  They're on stand down.
[01:26:14.620 --> 01:26:18.460]  The other reporters said that there's no border patrol.
[01:26:18.460 --> 01:26:23.300]  They showed the major Brownsville thing that I've been through many times used to be teaming.
[01:26:23.300 --> 01:26:25.820]  There was like two border patrol and the cars just drive through.
[01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:26.820]  It's gone.
[01:26:26.820 --> 01:26:27.820]  It's gone.
[01:26:27.820 --> 01:26:29.340]  It's North American Union.
[01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:32.620]  The country currently is in cardiac arrest.
[01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:33.620]  I'm sorry.
[01:26:33.620 --> 01:26:34.620]  Can't go ahead and make your points.
[01:26:34.620 --> 01:26:35.620]  I'm literally just got lightheaded.
[01:26:35.620 --> 01:26:38.580]  Yeah, I haven't been down here probably about 10 years or so.
[01:26:38.580 --> 01:26:41.540]  So I don't really have a friend of reference is what to expect.
[01:26:41.540 --> 01:26:45.260]  But I expected a lot more border patrol agents than what I've seen so far.
[01:26:45.260 --> 01:26:46.260]  This is unbelievable.
[01:26:46.260 --> 01:26:52.420]  I mean, I was looking around at the turn pan the camera, maybe at the border patrol station
[01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:53.740]  to see if there's anyone I could talk to.
[01:26:53.740 --> 01:26:56.740]  There's absolutely nobody standing around.
[01:26:56.740 --> 01:26:58.940]  It's like a wide open border, literally.
[01:26:58.940 --> 01:27:02.980]  Yeah, Jacobson continue to pan around while he talks.
[01:27:02.980 --> 01:27:05.980]  It's unbelievable.
[01:27:05.980 --> 01:27:13.140]  And it's just, this is just a complete stand down and the fact that they're turning their
[01:27:13.140 --> 01:27:18.100]  shutting down public roads just emphasizes the fact there's immediate blackouts.
[01:27:18.100 --> 01:27:20.780]  Listen, shoot your own report in your own words.
[01:27:20.780 --> 01:27:25.100]  Clearly there's a stand down and we need to get an article out tomorrow about this.
[01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:26.100]  David Knight.
[01:27:26.100 --> 01:27:31.740]  Well, Alex, you said earlier that that that fed bed biz ops solicitation said that they
[01:27:31.740 --> 01:27:33.620]  wanted to bring them in with dignity.
[01:27:33.620 --> 01:27:38.260]  They'd be the only people entering America anymore with any dignity because the TSA was
[01:27:38.260 --> 01:27:41.060]  set up to take away our dignity and our freedom.
[01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:42.900]  Our troops are on death list.
[01:27:42.900 --> 01:27:43.900]  They don't give veterans.
[01:27:43.900 --> 01:27:44.900]  They let them die.
[01:27:44.900 --> 01:27:45.900]  Where's their dignity?
[01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:50.460]  If they were not democratic voters, so they don't get jacked crap.
[01:27:50.460 --> 01:27:51.460]  That's right.
[01:27:51.460 --> 01:27:53.980]  If they were serious and I'm really having trouble not cussing, I'm being honest because
[01:27:53.980 --> 01:27:57.660]  sometimes I'm not a cusser, but sometimes that's the only words I've got.
[01:27:57.660 --> 01:27:59.940]  This is BS, man.
[01:27:59.940 --> 01:28:03.020]  This damn government is criminal, filthy scum.
[01:28:03.020 --> 01:28:06.980]  God almighty people, what the hell won't you put up with?
[01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:07.980]  I'm sorry, David.
[01:28:07.980 --> 01:28:08.980]  Go ahead.
[01:28:08.980 --> 01:28:12.900]  Well, it quietly came out and we were the only people to cover it.
[01:28:12.900 --> 01:28:17.820]  When John Corbett sued the TSA and was able to see their documents, he saw that in 2011
[01:28:17.820 --> 01:28:22.700]  in their documents, it said that there was no threat according to the TSA at any of the
[01:28:22.700 --> 01:28:23.700]  airports or to-
[01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:25.740]  It's all horse crap.
[01:28:25.740 --> 01:28:26.740]  Exactly.
[01:28:26.740 --> 01:28:31.220]  That was released because the lawsuit, they mistakenly put the unredacted copy up and
[01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:32.340]  then put the redacted copy.
[01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:38.140]  It's an authoritarian takeover to get your bank accounts, people, when they get rid of
[01:28:38.140 --> 01:28:40.140]  the Bellarites, it's over.
[01:28:40.140 --> 01:28:42.100]  They will screw us to the wall.
[01:28:42.100 --> 01:28:45.180]  You think you're getting screwed now with food prices doubling?
[01:28:45.180 --> 01:28:49.580]  Get ready for hyperinflation and we'll get to watch the very people, David, that engineered
[01:28:49.580 --> 01:28:51.060]  this whole thing poses the saviors.
[01:28:51.060 --> 01:28:53.260]  I can't even look at this Hillary Clinton poster.
[01:28:53.260 --> 01:28:55.260]  I want to throw up, man.
[01:28:55.260 --> 01:28:56.260]  Well, you know what?
[01:28:56.260 --> 01:28:57.260]  God, I'm sorry.
[01:28:57.260 --> 01:28:58.260]  Go ahead.
[01:28:58.260 --> 01:29:02.020]  Well, Petraeus was at this conference last week and of course now, after being a general
[01:29:02.020 --> 01:29:05.620]  in charge of Afghanistan, the drug operations there and then being with the CIA, now he's
[01:29:05.620 --> 01:29:08.220]  an investment banker with KKR, okay?
[01:29:08.220 --> 01:29:12.980]  So he's talking about NAFTA and he's saying that it's got an advantage over Europe and
[01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:17.180]  even China because our demographics are going up while theirs are going down.
[01:29:17.180 --> 01:29:21.980]  The only way that NAFTA's demographics are going up is because of the massive influx
[01:29:21.980 --> 01:29:22.980]  of ill-little kids.
[01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:26.700]  But they're bringing in disabled people and mothers with little kids, that's just clowered
[01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:27.700]  and pivoted.
[01:29:27.700 --> 01:29:31.860]  See, they say North American unions to get us up while they shut everything off, just
[01:29:31.860 --> 01:29:33.860]  like they said NAFTA and GATT would help us.
[01:29:33.860 --> 01:29:36.860]  And then immediately after he talks about the fact that we've got demographics that
[01:29:36.860 --> 01:29:42.460]  are surging up and of course this is Petraeus's NAFTA surge that we're seeing now, immediately
[01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:45.060]  after he says, well, we've got the advantage because we've got the workers coming in, then
[01:29:45.060 --> 01:29:48.260]  he says, well, we've got a revolution going on where instead of having a hundred people
[01:29:48.260 --> 01:29:50.860]  on an assembly line, we're going to have two people and a hundred robots.
[01:29:50.860 --> 01:29:52.380]  Well, what are we going to do with all the people?
[01:29:52.380 --> 01:29:53.620]  No, it's going to be political.
[01:29:53.620 --> 01:29:54.620]  Bring down the country.
[01:29:54.620 --> 01:29:55.620]  I mean, you're-
[01:29:55.620 --> 01:29:56.620]  By the way, I want to show that headline.
[01:29:56.620 --> 01:29:57.620]  Let's-
[01:29:57.620 --> 01:30:00.060]  Mexicans, it's going away because these robots that they're going to bring online.
[01:30:00.060 --> 01:30:02.860]  I want to find that article because people say, oh, you didn't say that.
[01:30:02.860 --> 01:30:04.460]  One in Telegraph will find it during the break.
[01:30:04.460 --> 01:30:06.220]  Kids, stay with us for the rest.
[01:30:06.220 --> 01:30:08.660]  I said I'd take some calls when I'm so wound up right now.
[01:30:08.660 --> 01:30:10.860]  Look, you're supposed to freak out about this.
[01:30:10.860 --> 01:30:12.980]  People yell and scream about their sports team winning or losing.
[01:30:12.980 --> 01:30:17.180]  I yell and scream when I'm treated like a slave everywhere and the border is stinking
[01:30:17.180 --> 01:30:23.380]  open and I know all these people having their houses taken by the IRS who even paid the
[01:30:23.380 --> 01:30:25.580]  money even though it's unconstitutional.
[01:30:25.580 --> 01:30:30.140]  I mean, it's like literally I have to go to Mexico, renounce my citizenship to come back
[01:30:30.140 --> 01:30:31.540]  here to have any freedom.
[01:30:31.540 --> 01:30:32.540]  That's right.
[01:30:32.540 --> 01:30:34.940]  And have they stood down anybody at the airport?
[01:30:34.940 --> 01:30:39.100]  No, they're still going through this basic facade that they've had with the TSA, denying
[01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:42.460]  us of the dignity that they're giving the people who are coming in here illegally.
[01:30:42.460 --> 01:30:43.460]  The gang-
[01:30:43.460 --> 01:30:46.660]  Yeah, and by the way, all the other talk shows that listen to this show, grow up and admit
[01:30:46.660 --> 01:30:49.300]  we've been right about all this and join the team, okay?
[01:30:49.300 --> 01:30:53.220]  We'll be right back with Kit Daniels has more.
[01:30:53.220 --> 01:30:54.220]  Stay with us.
[01:30:54.220 --> 01:30:55.220]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:55.220 --> 01:30:56.220]  Infowars.com.
[01:30:56.220 --> 01:30:59.820]  Oh, man, I got to settle down during this break.
[01:30:59.820 --> 01:31:03.380]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so
[01:31:03.380 --> 01:31:06.300]  much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:11.060]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:31:11.060 --> 01:31:15.420]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:31:15.420 --> 01:31:18.620]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:24.020]  You now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:31:24.020 --> 01:31:27.660]  Then about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to
[01:31:27.660 --> 01:31:31.580]  come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[01:31:31.580 --> 01:31:35.900]  The results that I personally have had have been life changing.
[01:31:35.900 --> 01:31:40.740]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:31:40.740 --> 01:31:45.700]  This is innovating, and the best part is it helps fund Infowars.com, the radio show, the
[01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:49.300]  TV show, the whole media operation, promoting true libertarian ideas.
[01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:53.620]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of survival shield X2.

[01:31:58.900 --> 01:32:02.500]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Group.
[01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:08.180]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity
[01:32:08.180 --> 01:32:09.940]  iodine available.
[01:32:09.940 --> 01:32:18.380]  The new survival shield X2 is mined from 7 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine,
[01:32:18.380 --> 01:32:20.780]  environmentally clean conditions.
[01:32:20.780 --> 01:32:27.780]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient, 300 million plus year old
[01:32:27.780 --> 01:32:30.780]  deposit deep in the earth.
[01:32:30.780 --> 01:32:34.780]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[01:32:34.780 --> 01:32:39.100]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[01:32:39.100 --> 01:32:41.220]  Experience the new formula.
[01:32:41.220 --> 01:32:43.460]  Experience the ancient purity.
[01:32:43.460 --> 01:32:44.900]  Shield your family.
[01:32:44.900 --> 01:32:49.540]  Survival shield X2, available now at InfowarsLife.com.
[01:32:49.540 --> 01:32:56.540]  Or call toll 3-888-253-3139.

[01:33:48.540 --> 01:34:03.740]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more
[01:34:03.740 --> 01:34:07.820]  toxic each and every day, but it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:34:07.820 --> 01:34:12.220]  Indoor air has been shown to have 2 to 5 times higher concentrations of pollutants than even
[01:34:12.220 --> 01:34:17.260]  outdoor air, and most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals
[01:34:17.260 --> 01:34:18.260]  within their homes.
[01:34:18.260 --> 01:34:21.660]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:34:21.660 --> 01:34:26.180]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions, and don't forget
[01:34:26.180 --> 01:34:29.820]  the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:34:29.820 --> 01:34:34.300]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing
[01:34:34.300 --> 01:34:39.300]  my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight
[01:34:39.300 --> 01:34:44.580]  back against, made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[01:34:44.580 --> 01:34:48.980]  The new InfowarsLife lung cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought
[01:34:48.980 --> 01:34:51.100]  with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:34:51.100 --> 01:35:00.620]  Now available exclusively at InfowarsLife.com or by calling toll 3-888-2533139.
[01:35:00.620 --> 01:35:04.340]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[01:35:04.340 --> 01:35:16.140]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:35:16.140 --> 01:35:21.260]  Defending the Republic from enemies born and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:35:21.260 --> 01:35:24.620]  That gun kicks as hard as it should.
[01:35:24.620 --> 01:35:31.860]  Born of Joni and physics, for every action there's an opposite and equal reaction.
[01:35:31.860 --> 01:35:36.300]  All the major political professors, liberal conservatives, it doesn't matter from Turley
[01:35:36.300 --> 01:35:44.740]  to Fine, from Bruce Fine to Jonathan Turley say we're going into ultra-fascism.
[01:35:44.740 --> 01:35:49.340]  And I noticed the globalists have adopted fascist names, Homeland Security, the uniforms
[01:35:49.340 --> 01:35:52.500]  because they know it's worked before for them to take over.
[01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:56.020]  They know the public's so stupid, so dumbed down, they're just doing it, but for those
[01:35:56.020 --> 01:36:01.780]  of us that are informed, I mean it is an emergency situation in this country.
[01:36:01.780 --> 01:36:07.380]  And I have a whole stack of articles I want to get to in the next segment about food prices.
[01:36:07.380 --> 01:36:12.100]  And I've been saying, you know, inflation is going up faster than people in the government
[01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:13.100]  saying.
[01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:16.220]  They claim, oh, it surged 0.3%.
[01:36:16.220 --> 01:36:20.940]  I've been going to places for breakfast for years, and just the last year, a plate of
[01:36:20.940 --> 01:36:26.580]  eggs, hash browns and stuff, has gone up 75%.
[01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:30.460]  Everybody I talked to says that, and now they have to admit it, so we're going to be talking
[01:36:30.460 --> 01:36:33.780]  about that and what that means and why that's happening, folks.
[01:36:33.780 --> 01:36:39.340]  The hidden quantitative easing tax, that's why they're so mad at Brad up in Virginia
[01:36:39.340 --> 01:36:43.060]  who just won the primary, he's an economist, an engineer and a bunch of stuff, is that
[01:36:43.060 --> 01:36:44.060]  he keeps pointing that out.
[01:36:44.060 --> 01:36:49.140]  They go, it cares, weirdo, he's warning you about the Weimar Republic, David.
[01:36:49.140 --> 01:36:54.060]  Now, he's all about pointing out what the bankers are doing, looting this country.
[01:36:54.060 --> 01:36:55.060]  And not your corner bank.
[01:36:55.060 --> 01:36:56.060]  That's right.
[01:36:56.060 --> 01:36:57.060]  They're great people.
[01:36:57.060 --> 01:36:58.060]  We're done by the Federal Reserve, yeah.
[01:36:58.060 --> 01:36:59.060]  That's right.
[01:36:59.060 --> 01:37:01.540]  That's what they're able to do with that, and that's why they really don't like him.
[01:37:01.540 --> 01:37:03.380]  I mean, he's an economics professor.
[01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:04.860]  That's going to be an interesting race.
[01:37:04.860 --> 01:37:09.500]  His opponent is from the same small university, but he's an economics professor, and that
[01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:10.500]  was his core thing.
[01:37:10.500 --> 01:37:13.220]  He said, these guys ought to be put in jail.
[01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:14.220]  Look at what they did.
[01:37:14.220 --> 01:37:15.220]  It's counterfeiting.
[01:37:15.220 --> 01:37:16.220]  It's counterfeiting.
[01:37:16.220 --> 01:37:17.220]  It's counterfeiting.
[01:37:17.220 --> 01:37:18.220]  So he understands what that is.
[01:37:18.220 --> 01:37:20.700]  Well, it's counterfeiting bad because it lowers the quality of the money, lowers the
[01:37:20.700 --> 01:37:21.700]  value.
[01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:25.300]  But they play these games with all the unemployment rates, with inflation rates and anything, because
[01:37:25.300 --> 01:37:28.980]  you can, depending on how you set up your equations, what you decide that you're going
[01:37:28.980 --> 01:37:29.980]  to do.
[01:37:29.980 --> 01:37:30.980]  But it's so bad.
[01:37:30.980 --> 01:37:31.980]  Those don't even work now.
[01:37:31.980 --> 01:37:32.980]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:37:32.980 --> 01:37:36.900]  But that's the issue, just like the illegals.
[01:37:36.900 --> 01:37:38.700]  You lower the wages in Mexico.
[01:37:38.700 --> 01:37:40.260]  You don't raise the Mexicans.
[01:37:40.260 --> 01:37:42.100]  You lower us, and then you lower them.
[01:37:42.100 --> 01:37:44.300]  And that's what Ross Perot explained in his debates.
[01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:47.900]  We just do a whole show on that, on seeing it.
[01:37:47.900 --> 01:37:50.380]  And I'll go over that confident and laugh at him.
[01:37:50.380 --> 01:37:54.420]  And the media said, oh, Perot was destroyed in the debate, and the weak public, when he
[01:37:54.420 --> 01:37:58.820]  was destroyed, even though you watch it, and I watched it live at the time, I was, you
[01:37:58.820 --> 01:38:02.140]  know, like in college, he just, he, Perot destroyed him.
[01:38:02.140 --> 01:38:05.660]  And of course, they set up NAFTA 20 years ago, and they always like to set up the legal
[01:38:05.660 --> 01:38:09.900]  framework and then gradually bring it in as a fait accompli.
[01:38:09.900 --> 01:38:10.900]  Through that, exactly.
[01:38:10.900 --> 01:38:12.900]  Just like the EU was an economic deal.
[01:38:12.900 --> 01:38:13.900]  Exactly.
[01:38:13.900 --> 01:38:18.260]  So that's why it is so amazingly scary when we see things like the NDAA, where he says
[01:38:18.260 --> 01:38:22.500]  the military can arrest you and hold you indefinitely without trial, they can deport
[01:38:22.500 --> 01:38:23.500]  you.
[01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:26.260]  They don't put that stuff in and not intend to use it.
[01:38:26.260 --> 01:38:30.900]  Well, I mean, take Ross Perot, and we're going back to the border with Kit Daniels.
[01:38:30.900 --> 01:38:35.700]  You watch that, Ross Perot realized this was going to kill the country, and it wasn't
[01:38:35.700 --> 01:38:39.260]  that he was even a perfect guy, you know, he's part of the establishment, got government
[01:38:39.260 --> 01:38:40.260]  contracts and stuff.
[01:38:40.260 --> 01:38:41.260]  I don't care.
[01:38:41.260 --> 01:38:44.460]  He was selling good products, but they made an issue out of that.
[01:38:44.460 --> 01:38:49.140]  The point was, everything he said was true lesson, they're paying $25 an hour in Canada.
[01:38:49.140 --> 01:38:53.580]  Five years after we got rid of our border and trade deal with him, we were on, our workers
[01:38:53.580 --> 01:38:59.900]  were paid $18 an hour on average at the factories, and it lowered them and we went down as well.
[01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:04.500]  So what happens is they go down, we go down, and then you go to Mexico, it'll lower them
[01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:05.620]  and lower us.
[01:39:05.620 --> 01:39:08.820]  This is not a good deal for anybody, but the guys that are running these companies, and
[01:39:08.820 --> 01:39:12.660]  listen, my issue is I'm all free market, but this isn't free market when you set up a
[01:39:12.660 --> 01:39:17.140]  deal where you're dealing with a slave state like China and their workers.
[01:39:17.140 --> 01:39:19.300]  That will be a giant second sound at the bottom.
[01:39:19.300 --> 01:39:23.900]  We've got a demand higher pay for everybody across the board, but not with fixed prices
[01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:28.900]  and not with some minimum wage, but with not, you know, debasing your industrial base.
[01:39:28.900 --> 01:39:30.740]  That's where the real value comes from.
[01:39:30.740 --> 01:39:31.740]  Now who was right?
[01:39:31.740 --> 01:39:32.740]  Him or Al Gore?
[01:39:32.740 --> 01:39:33.740]  Yeah.
[01:39:33.740 --> 01:39:38.100]  Well, as you said before, Al Gore and Bill Clinton went to Bilderberg and said they're
[01:39:38.100 --> 01:39:40.980]  going to sign on to NAFTA, whatever they wanted.
[01:39:40.980 --> 01:39:42.700]  They got put in, we got NAFTA.
[01:39:42.700 --> 01:39:43.700]  That's exactly what they want.
[01:39:43.700 --> 01:39:47.860]  They want that consolidation here in North America as well as what they did in the European
[01:39:47.860 --> 01:39:48.860]  Union.
[01:39:48.860 --> 01:39:53.940]  They want this secretive trade agreement, both a Pacific trade partnership as well as
[01:39:53.940 --> 01:39:55.620]  a transatlantic trade partnership.
[01:39:55.620 --> 01:39:57.780]  And say this again, no one's allowed to see it.
[01:39:57.780 --> 01:39:58.780]  That's right.
[01:39:58.780 --> 01:39:59.780]  Or that sounds like freedom.
[01:39:59.780 --> 01:40:00.780]  We like the borders.
[01:40:00.780 --> 01:40:01.780]  You can't see what's going on at the borders.
[01:40:01.780 --> 01:40:05.260]  You can't see these new laws that they're putting in that are going to essentially,
[01:40:05.260 --> 01:40:09.340]  through the back door, not just trade and economic issues, but I mean, these are hardcore
[01:40:09.340 --> 01:40:12.460]  things that are going to come after us in terms of internet freedom where they couldn't
[01:40:12.460 --> 01:40:13.960]  get CISPA through multiple.
[01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:14.960]  It just clicked.
[01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:15.960]  They're going to put it in.
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:16.960]  It just clicked.
[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:17.960]  It's all happening.
[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:19.500]  We say the hammer hadn't dropped.
[01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:23.260]  It's just dropped, but it's the whole question of if a tree falls, nobody hears it, it doesn't
[01:40:23.260 --> 01:40:24.260]  make a sound.
[01:40:24.260 --> 01:40:25.260]  Well, the tree fell.
[01:40:25.260 --> 01:40:26.260]  It's here.
[01:40:26.260 --> 01:40:27.260]  They are doing it.
[01:40:27.260 --> 01:40:29.660]  And people need to know, folks, it means the end of prosperity.
[01:40:29.660 --> 01:40:33.860]  Just like QE Unlimited means your prices are going to double.
[01:40:33.860 --> 01:40:34.860]  Shut down your power plants.
[01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:36.100]  They're going to bankrupt you.
[01:40:36.100 --> 01:40:38.260]  That's why that's important when Obama does that.
[01:40:38.260 --> 01:40:40.460]  And then let's Mexico have all the power plants they want.
[01:40:40.460 --> 01:40:43.820]  It means your factories have to go there because they can't get the power.
[01:40:43.820 --> 01:40:46.940]  See, I mean, this is war, folks.
[01:40:46.940 --> 01:40:50.860]  And that's why I freak out so bad, because it's like watching a bank robbery.
[01:40:50.860 --> 01:40:51.860]  It's like Edge of Tomorrow.
[01:40:51.860 --> 01:40:54.660]  I watch the robbery go on every day, worse and worse.
[01:40:54.660 --> 01:40:56.820]  It's a groundhog day that gets worse.
[01:40:56.820 --> 01:41:00.580]  And I'm just trying to get the, instead, I tune in to local radio and, oh, the morning
[01:41:00.580 --> 01:41:02.220]  show's making fun of me.
[01:41:02.220 --> 01:41:05.300]  And then the night show and then the news is making fun of me.
[01:41:05.300 --> 01:41:07.220]  It's all so funny, David.
[01:41:07.220 --> 01:41:08.820]  It's real funny, David.
[01:41:08.820 --> 01:41:10.820]  Well, here's one thing, Alex.
[01:41:10.820 --> 01:41:12.420]  Look at what's going on with transportation.
[01:41:12.420 --> 01:41:15.580]  All of these service sector jobs are now going to go away in the next three to five
[01:41:15.580 --> 01:41:16.580]  years.
[01:41:16.580 --> 01:41:17.580]  Exactly.
[01:41:17.580 --> 01:41:20.700]  At the beginning of the year, they were talking about, hey, the technology for self-driving
[01:41:20.700 --> 01:41:23.540]  and what they mean by that is computer-driven cars is already here.
[01:41:23.540 --> 01:41:24.700]  We just need the legal framework.
[01:41:24.700 --> 01:41:25.700]  So what happened?
[01:41:25.700 --> 01:41:29.420]  About three months later in April, you started seeing the European Union, California all
[01:41:29.420 --> 01:41:32.380]  greasing the skids legally for them to put these self-driving cars on.
[01:41:32.380 --> 01:41:36.300]  Now, you got this big thing going on between Uber, the ride-sharing company, that's now
[01:41:36.300 --> 01:41:39.820]  up to $17 billion in capitalization.
[01:41:39.820 --> 01:41:43.820]  They just had a new round of funding where they got $1.2 billion.
[01:41:43.820 --> 01:41:45.900]  They're being fought by all these taxi drivers.
[01:41:45.900 --> 01:41:51.060]  They had 12,000 taxi drivers in England show up to protest Uber.
[01:41:51.060 --> 01:41:56.300]  What they don't understand is that when Uber, whether or not they beat back Uber for the
[01:41:56.300 --> 01:42:01.900]  next three to five years, Uber has already said, this is about making vehicles something
[01:42:01.900 --> 01:42:03.900]  other than privately-owned hardware.
[01:42:03.900 --> 01:42:07.420]  We're going to make transportation community-owned.
[01:42:07.420 --> 01:42:11.460]  And the thing that makes our taxi drives expensive is that dude in the car with you.
[01:42:11.460 --> 01:42:14.420]  He's going to go away as soon as we get computer-driven government-
[01:42:14.420 --> 01:42:17.380]  That's it, it's about removing your mobility.
[01:42:17.380 --> 01:42:18.380]  Everything's surveilled.
[01:42:18.380 --> 01:42:23.340]  It's a technological technocracy end of humanity takeover in their own words.
[01:42:23.340 --> 01:42:27.540]  I didn't come up with all this that just keeps coming true and people go, how does he know
[01:42:27.540 --> 01:42:28.540]  this?
[01:42:28.540 --> 01:42:29.540]  It's all laid out.
[01:42:29.540 --> 01:42:31.220]  Oh, Uber's been very upfront about it.
[01:42:31.220 --> 01:42:34.980]  We're going to see the end of private ownership of cars.
[01:42:34.980 --> 01:42:37.100]  It's an anachronism as far as they're concerned.
[01:42:37.100 --> 01:42:40.860]  They're going to force us by both positive things that they offer us.
[01:42:40.860 --> 01:42:43.500]  Just like I told people, they're putting the satellite tracker boxes in.
[01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:44.500]  Let's go back to Kit real quick.
[01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:46.220]  Kit, you're going to have live reports tomorrow.
[01:42:46.220 --> 01:42:48.100]  You're going to follow some reports tonight.
[01:42:48.100 --> 01:42:52.340]  What else is it important for you to add down there at the Texas border in Brownsville that
[01:42:52.340 --> 01:42:53.900]  you've been seeing and witnessing?
[01:42:53.900 --> 01:43:00.700]  Well, one thing we noticed is drive and just hugging the border, the border's wide open.
[01:43:00.700 --> 01:43:01.700]  There's no doubt about it.
[01:43:01.700 --> 01:43:03.220]  No doubt about it.
[01:43:03.220 --> 01:43:08.260]  It was just, and the fact that the border is this restricted from us from even going
[01:43:08.260 --> 01:43:11.020]  near the border, even though we're on the American side of the border, we're not allowed
[01:43:11.020 --> 01:43:14.100]  somehow to go to that area.
[01:43:14.100 --> 01:43:18.100]  Well, yeah, I mean, a child molester wants to do it in secret.
[01:43:18.100 --> 01:43:20.540]  I mean, a criminal wants to do it in secret, of course.
[01:43:20.540 --> 01:43:24.060]  Yeah, there's no, there's absolutely no border security whatsoever down here.
[01:43:24.060 --> 01:43:26.300]  None at all.
[01:43:26.300 --> 01:43:32.420]  And just standing out here for the past hour, I've only seen maybe a handful of border patrol
[01:43:32.420 --> 01:43:33.420]  vehicles just driving by.
[01:43:33.420 --> 01:43:34.420]  And you're at their headquarters.
[01:43:34.420 --> 01:43:35.420]  You're at their headquarters.
[01:43:35.420 --> 01:43:37.780]  Yeah, we're at their headquarters.
[01:43:37.780 --> 01:43:43.860]  And to put it into perspective, I read an article recently, and even to add to that,
[01:43:43.860 --> 01:43:47.780]  the fact that the mainstream media has now started to report on what we've been breaking
[01:43:47.780 --> 01:43:49.300]  in the past two weeks.
[01:43:49.300 --> 01:43:56.140]  And they have said that the border patrol, their drug seizures for the past six months
[01:43:56.140 --> 01:43:58.940]  is down 34% in Texas alone.
[01:43:58.940 --> 01:44:02.420]  It's even doubled that in New Mexico.
[01:44:02.420 --> 01:44:07.740]  That just because all the border patrol officers are too busy changing diapers at the facilities
[01:44:07.740 --> 01:44:09.100]  that they're getting pulled off of the border.
[01:44:09.100 --> 01:44:11.900]  And people say, well, wait, the government wants a monopoly of drugs so the big banks
[01:44:11.900 --> 01:44:13.540]  can launder it.
[01:44:13.540 --> 01:44:14.980]  They don't need the border patrol anymore.
[01:44:14.980 --> 01:44:18.580]  The CIA runs Los Sedes on record that came out in the federal court.
[01:44:18.580 --> 01:44:22.980]  They're there to enforce only narcotics coming in laundered by the big banks.
[01:44:22.980 --> 01:44:25.820]  See, they've already got their police force internally.
[01:44:25.820 --> 01:44:31.220]  See, globalists get rid of the major borders, but then set up new secret borders.
[01:44:31.220 --> 01:44:33.940]  That's what Brzezinski talks about in sub-sex, sub-sectors.
[01:44:33.940 --> 01:44:36.820]  I mean, this is a scientific program.
[01:44:36.820 --> 01:44:37.820]  Oh, yeah.
[01:44:37.820 --> 01:44:38.820]  Yeah.
[01:44:38.820 --> 01:44:39.820]  People wonder what's going on.
[01:44:39.820 --> 01:44:40.820]  They say, how could this be happening?
[01:44:40.820 --> 01:44:42.620]  Look at the massive incompetence.
[01:44:42.620 --> 01:44:43.620]  It's not incompetence.
[01:44:43.620 --> 01:44:46.260]  They just don't understand what the purpose is behind it.
[01:44:46.260 --> 01:44:49.060]  They don't understand what the scheme is behind it, where they're going.
[01:44:49.060 --> 01:44:50.060]  This is planned and working.
[01:44:50.060 --> 01:44:53.780]  They came out with cruise missiles 45 years ago that could shoot down your chimney.
[01:44:53.780 --> 01:45:00.820]  The globalists are precision, precision guided evil.
[01:45:00.820 --> 01:45:01.820]  In the near future.
[01:45:01.820 --> 01:45:06.820]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[01:45:06.820 --> 01:45:07.820]  Security alert.
[01:45:07.820 --> 01:45:13.300]  This is Homeland Security, analysis, info wars, building independent media operations.
[01:45:13.300 --> 01:45:18.300]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:45:18.300 --> 01:45:21.300]  Prime directive discredit Alex Jones.
[01:45:21.300 --> 01:45:23.820]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory.
[01:45:23.820 --> 01:45:27.180]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called Info Wars.
[01:45:27.180 --> 01:45:29.300]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:45:29.300 --> 01:45:31.300]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:45:31.300 --> 01:45:33.300]  They are the people who are the victims of patriots engaged.
[01:45:33.300 --> 01:45:35.300]  They are never going to stop.
[01:45:35.300 --> 01:45:39.300]  They are never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[01:45:49.300 --> 01:45:51.300]  You got a censor eye on the enemy.
[01:45:51.300 --> 01:45:54.300]  Not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:45:54.300 --> 01:45:55.300]  Electrally, it's begun.
[01:45:55.300 --> 01:45:56.300]  You can fail it.
[01:45:56.300 --> 01:46:01.300]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[01:46:01.300 --> 01:46:07.300]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes
[01:46:07.300 --> 01:46:12.300]  instead of using synthetic chemicals sourced from powerful organic herbs
[01:46:12.300 --> 01:46:17.300]  harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[01:46:17.300 --> 01:46:22.300]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago and I must say that was good stuff.
[01:46:22.300 --> 01:46:27.300]  Even top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe
[01:46:27.300 --> 01:46:32.300]  is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[01:46:32.300 --> 01:46:38.300]  Super male vitality by Info Wars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[01:46:59.300 --> 01:47:03.300]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:47:03.300 --> 01:47:07.300]  This year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:47:07.300 --> 01:47:11.300]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:47:11.300 --> 01:47:14.300]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:47:14.300 --> 01:47:19.300]  My friend's water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family
[01:47:19.300 --> 01:47:22.300]  from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:47:22.300 --> 01:47:26.300]  On average the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:47:26.300 --> 01:47:30.300]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:47:30.300 --> 01:47:36.300]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:47:36.300 --> 01:47:40.300]  Fluoride is in teats and coffins and waters and breads and toothpaste.
[01:47:40.300 --> 01:47:43.300]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:47:43.300 --> 01:47:44.300]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:47:44.300 --> 01:47:45.300]  It's time to take action.
[01:47:45.300 --> 01:47:47.300]  It's time to filter our water.

[01:47:59.300 --> 01:48:03.300]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much
[01:48:03.300 --> 01:48:05.300]  get healthy and detoxify.
[01:48:05.300 --> 01:48:09.300]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:48:09.300 --> 01:48:14.300]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:48:14.300 --> 01:48:17.300]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:48:17.300 --> 01:48:23.300]  You now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:48:23.300 --> 01:48:26.300]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful,
[01:48:26.300 --> 01:48:30.300]  I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[01:48:30.300 --> 01:48:34.300]  And the results that I personally have had have been life changing.
[01:48:34.300 --> 01:48:39.300]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:48:39.300 --> 01:48:45.300]  This is innovating, and the best part is it helps fund infowars.com, the radio show, the TV show,
[01:48:45.300 --> 01:48:48.300]  the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[01:48:48.300 --> 01:48:52.300]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of survival shield X2.

[01:49:10.300 --> 01:49:39.300]  A couple of decades ago, Australia had a mass shooting similar to Columbine or Newtown.
[01:49:39.300 --> 01:49:44.300]  And Australia just said, well, that's it.
[01:49:44.300 --> 01:49:47.300]  We're not doing, we're not seeing that again.
[01:49:47.300 --> 01:49:55.300]  And basically imposed very severe, tough gun laws.
[01:49:55.300 --> 01:49:57.300]  Man, everything but single shot.
[01:49:57.300 --> 01:49:59.300]  Oh, they had plenty of mass shootings.
[01:49:59.300 --> 01:50:02.300]  I mean, muggings and general crime exploded.
[01:50:02.300 --> 01:50:05.300]  Off the charts, there's no...
[01:50:05.300 --> 01:50:09.300]  That's true.
[01:50:09.300 --> 01:50:11.300]  Switzerland, you have to own a gun by law.
[01:50:11.300 --> 01:50:13.300]  You're a citizen of the lowest crime rate in the world.
[01:50:13.300 --> 01:50:14.300]  Just all lies.
[01:50:14.300 --> 01:50:16.300]  I want to finish up with Kit Daniels.
[01:50:16.300 --> 01:50:21.300]  And in some of the reports, he's going to be filing an HD to infowars.com tonight and tomorrow.
[01:50:21.300 --> 01:50:27.300]  Any other points you'd like to add before we shift gears into some other news here in the final segment?
[01:50:27.300 --> 01:50:33.300]  What's important to realize that our border security has been reduced to an honor system.
[01:50:33.300 --> 01:50:39.300]  Instead of deporting illegal aliens, they're now just shipping in deeper in the U.S. to go to Massachusetts, Kansas.
[01:50:39.300 --> 01:50:42.300]  Well, no, they deport the illegals from Mexico to the U.S.
[01:50:42.300 --> 01:50:44.300]  It's a reverse deportation.
[01:50:44.300 --> 01:50:45.300]  Here's the interesting thing.
[01:50:45.300 --> 01:50:54.300]  In 2011, Mexico loosened their border security because they are expecting the U.S. to subsidize it.
[01:50:54.300 --> 01:50:56.300]  They're not concerned with their southern border with Guatemala.
[01:50:56.300 --> 01:50:58.300]  They're saying, well, let them all in.
[01:50:58.300 --> 01:50:59.300]  That's right.
[01:50:59.300 --> 01:51:03.300]  They're just draconian borders in Latin America, hard labor, six months at least.
[01:51:03.300 --> 01:51:05.300]  Even New York Times admitted that.
[01:51:05.300 --> 01:51:11.300]  So they're now opening up just saying, hey, long as you go to El Norte, man, wow.
[01:51:11.300 --> 01:51:18.300]  And so, and then once the illegals are getting bused by the motor patrol through taxpayer money,
[01:51:18.300 --> 01:51:20.300]  they're just saying, hey, just wait around.
[01:51:20.300 --> 01:51:25.300]  We'll give you a court date for your immigration court case.
[01:51:25.300 --> 01:51:27.300]  Most of them are never going to show up for that.
[01:51:27.300 --> 01:51:30.300]  Well, then Obama's cut deportations by 80-plus percent.
[01:51:30.300 --> 01:51:32.300]  I mean, it's just all fake.
[01:51:32.300 --> 01:51:36.300]  And on June 20th, Joe Biden even said that we're only going to,
[01:51:36.300 --> 01:51:40.300]  we're going to deport the massive majority of the children from Guatemala and El Salvador,
[01:51:40.300 --> 01:51:41.300]  but not all of them.
[01:51:41.300 --> 01:51:43.300]  That's just a statement like that.
[01:51:43.300 --> 01:51:46.300]  It's just enough to bring in thousands more into the country.
[01:51:46.300 --> 01:51:48.300]  Thousands, just thousands per day.
[01:51:48.300 --> 01:51:52.300]  Look, the plan is to collapse the border fully and then say,
[01:51:52.300 --> 01:51:55.300]  we're creating a North American security perimeter, which they already set up,
[01:51:55.300 --> 01:51:59.300]  to stop this because we got to have U.S. troops on the Guatemala border.
[01:51:59.300 --> 01:52:01.300]  And then it'll just be U.S. troops bringing them in.
[01:52:01.300 --> 01:52:02.300]  Yeah.
[01:52:02.300 --> 01:52:03.300]  Oh, yeah.
[01:52:03.300 --> 01:52:04.300]  That's the plan.
[01:52:04.300 --> 01:52:05.300]  That's their new army.
[01:52:05.300 --> 01:52:08.300]  Imagine if everybody just rushed the planes at the airport and just got on,
[01:52:08.300 --> 01:52:11.300]  went through security, and then the TSA just stood down.
[01:52:11.300 --> 01:52:14.300]  I mean, now they're going through people's shoes, X-raying us,
[01:52:14.300 --> 01:52:17.300]  all this theater that they have in there that absolutely is-
[01:52:17.300 --> 01:52:18.300]  Well, it's teaching you you're the terrorist.
[01:52:18.300 --> 01:52:19.300]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:52:19.300 --> 01:52:21.300]  It's not about security at all.
[01:52:21.300 --> 01:52:23.300]  And this shows the naked lie.
[01:52:23.300 --> 01:52:26.300]  It's the fact that they just open up the border, let people come through
[01:52:26.300 --> 01:52:30.300]  while they're still doing this nonsense in the airports.
[01:52:30.300 --> 01:52:33.300]  I want to shift gears finally from Kit and then to you here, David.
[01:52:33.300 --> 01:52:36.300]  Kit, you were there and got to talk to Hillary,
[01:52:36.300 --> 01:52:39.300]  and you got separate audio in the video, infowars.com, talking to her.
[01:52:39.300 --> 01:52:42.300]  What was it like being near such a vomitous creature?
[01:52:42.300 --> 01:52:45.300]  I was talking to Rob on the way down here about it,
[01:52:45.300 --> 01:52:49.300]  and I told him the best way to describe it is like in the Empire Strikes Back,
[01:52:49.300 --> 01:52:52.300]  when Luke goes into the cave in Dagobah,
[01:52:52.300 --> 01:52:54.300]  it's the Phantom of Darth Vader.
[01:52:54.300 --> 01:52:57.300]  That is exactly what it was like meeting Hillary Clinton.
[01:52:57.300 --> 01:53:03.300]  She has this facade of being polite, but she's got this aura of evilness about her.
[01:53:03.300 --> 01:53:06.300]  It literally put chills up my spine.
[01:53:06.300 --> 01:53:08.300]  I'm not even exaggerating.
[01:53:08.300 --> 01:53:11.300]  No, no, I've been around Jan and Reno, and it's chill.
[01:53:11.300 --> 01:53:12.300]  It's like cold.
[01:53:12.300 --> 01:53:14.300]  So I say, hell must be cold, because I don't get it.
[01:53:14.300 --> 01:53:17.300]  It's like a whoo, I mean, they're really evil.
[01:53:17.300 --> 01:53:21.300]  And I've been in courts and stuff following cases back when I did more local journalism
[01:53:21.300 --> 01:53:24.300]  when they've had like child killers and stuff in there, and you feel that same deal.
[01:53:24.300 --> 01:53:26.300]  I mean, they like the evil.
[01:53:26.300 --> 01:53:27.300]  And I'm not just saying that.
[01:53:27.300 --> 01:53:29.300]  You have to be around to experience it.
[01:53:29.300 --> 01:53:30.300]  You were there, what was it like?
[01:53:30.300 --> 01:53:31.300]  You can hear it in that tape.
[01:53:31.300 --> 01:53:35.300]  Well, you know, I guess the thing that really struck me most about it was, you know,
[01:53:35.300 --> 01:53:40.300]  here she is holding court in layer after layer, ring after ring of security.
[01:53:40.300 --> 01:53:44.300]  Searching people, every few feet there's private security or secret service.
[01:53:44.300 --> 01:53:46.300]  I couldn't tell which they were.
[01:53:46.300 --> 01:53:52.300]  You know, you live in that kind of the 99.99% of us don't experience.
[01:53:52.300 --> 01:53:59.300]  This is the.01% of the elite who really are terrorized when they think about all the
[01:53:59.300 --> 01:54:03.300]  rabble out there owning pitchforks, because they don't want to see that happen.
[01:54:03.300 --> 01:54:08.300]  And so I guess it really does terrorize her to think about the fact that there are people
[01:54:08.300 --> 01:54:13.300]  out there who could actually defend themselves and look after their own protection.
[01:54:13.300 --> 01:54:17.300]  Certainly, she can't understand what people are facing out there.
[01:54:17.300 --> 01:54:20.300]  And she clearly knows what the Second Amendment is about.
[01:54:20.300 --> 01:54:22.300]  She knows that it's about a deterrence.
[01:54:22.300 --> 01:54:23.300]  It's about...
[01:54:23.300 --> 01:54:24.300]  Dianne Feinstein carries a gun.
[01:54:24.300 --> 01:54:25.300]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:54:25.300 --> 01:54:26.300]  But she doesn't want you to be able to have one.
[01:54:26.300 --> 01:54:27.300]  That's right.
[01:54:27.300 --> 01:54:32.300]  And Hillary Clinton's got an entire entourage of Austin police as well as private security
[01:54:32.300 --> 01:54:37.300]  or secret service or whatever they are, protecting her everywhere, searching people, keeping these
[01:54:37.300 --> 01:54:38.300]  layers of security around her.
[01:54:38.300 --> 01:54:39.300]  She lives in a bubble.
[01:54:39.300 --> 01:54:44.300]  And you've got all these weird narcissists around her glowing on the power trip of being
[01:54:44.300 --> 01:54:45.300]  near the disgusting blob.
[01:54:45.300 --> 01:54:47.300]  Kit Daniels, we'll talk to you more tomorrow.
[01:54:47.300 --> 01:54:50.300]  Great job with the Hillary event and at the border.
[01:54:50.300 --> 01:54:52.300]  Continue to break major stories at infowars.com.
[01:54:52.300 --> 01:54:53.300]  Talk to you soon.
[01:54:53.300 --> 01:54:55.300]  Great job, Kit and Jacobson.
[01:54:55.300 --> 01:54:56.300]  All right.
[01:54:56.300 --> 01:55:00.300]  Finally, let's get to the new breaking scandal of when she was a lawyer.
[01:55:00.300 --> 01:55:02.300]  Her specialty was protecting pedophiles.
[01:55:02.300 --> 01:55:05.300]  I mean, imagine you want to be a lawyer, you choose.
[01:55:05.300 --> 01:55:11.300]  I think I want to protect child rapist that rape little girl so hard it sterilizes them.
[01:55:11.300 --> 01:55:17.300]  Well, what's just surfaced is an audio recording going back to 1975.
[01:55:17.300 --> 01:55:19.300]  I guess it was when the case was.
[01:55:19.300 --> 01:55:20.300]  And it's up on infowars.com.
[01:55:20.300 --> 01:55:22.300]  It's up on drudgerport.com.
[01:55:22.300 --> 01:55:23.300]  Yeah.
[01:55:23.300 --> 01:55:28.300]  And at the time there was this 13 year old girl who was molested and raped, a violent rape
[01:55:28.300 --> 01:55:31.300]  left her damaged for life.
[01:55:31.300 --> 01:55:35.300]  And Hillary Clinton said that they came to her because they wanted a female lawyer.
[01:55:35.300 --> 01:55:40.300]  The rapist wanted a female lawyer and she said that she gave this guy a polygraph test
[01:55:40.300 --> 01:55:43.300]  and she said he actually passed it and she laughed about it.
[01:55:43.300 --> 01:55:45.300]  She said it destroyed my faith in polygraphs forever.
[01:55:45.300 --> 01:55:50.300]  Then she talked about how she got him off on a technicality when they were,
[01:55:50.300 --> 01:55:53.300]  when they actually had forensic evidence that proved that he was guilty.
[01:55:53.300 --> 01:55:56.300]  She got that forensic evidence thrown out.
[01:55:56.300 --> 01:55:59.300]  Now this is something that briefly came up in 2008.
[01:55:59.300 --> 01:56:03.300]  The lady came up and she started to say something and they again attacked her,
[01:56:03.300 --> 01:56:04.300]  as is always the case.
[01:56:04.300 --> 01:56:06.300]  Even though she was only 13 years old at the time,
[01:56:06.300 --> 01:56:09.300]  they attacked her for talking about what Hillary Clinton had done
[01:56:09.300 --> 01:56:11.300]  and then in later years laughed about.
[01:56:11.300 --> 01:56:13.300]  Now this tape has come up.
[01:56:13.300 --> 01:56:15.300]  They had said she would laugh about it.
[01:56:15.300 --> 01:56:18.300]  And now, again, it's mainstream news.
[01:56:18.300 --> 01:56:20.300]  And we'll put up on screen while we're playing this tape,
[01:56:20.300 --> 01:56:22.300]  some of the articles where you can find the video.
[01:56:22.300 --> 01:56:23.300]  But again, it's on infowars.
[01:56:23.300 --> 01:56:25.300]  Here is some of that tape.
[01:56:25.300 --> 01:56:30.300]  Of course he climbed and he didn't do all this stuff.
[01:56:30.300 --> 01:56:32.300]  He took a lot of technical tests.
[01:56:32.300 --> 01:56:34.300]  I have to apologize.
[01:56:34.300 --> 01:56:38.300]  Which he passed, which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs.
[01:56:38.300 --> 01:56:40.300]  I have a lot more.
[01:56:40.300 --> 01:56:47.300]  You know, what was said about it was that the prosecutors had evidence
[01:56:47.300 --> 01:56:50.300]  among which was his underwear.
[01:56:50.300 --> 01:56:51.300]  His what?
[01:56:51.300 --> 01:56:54.300]  His underwear, which was blood.
[01:56:54.300 --> 01:56:56.300]  Body underwear.
[01:56:56.300 --> 01:56:59.300]  He sent that a crime lab.
[01:56:59.300 --> 01:57:03.300]  For those efforts to perform the crime lab.
[01:57:03.300 --> 01:57:04.300]  Crime lab.
[01:57:04.300 --> 01:57:07.300]  Took a pair of underpants.
[01:57:07.300 --> 01:57:11.300]  Neatly cut out the part that they were going to test.
[01:57:11.300 --> 01:57:12.300]  Fantastic.
[01:57:12.300 --> 01:57:15.300]  Came back with the result of what kind of blood it was.
[01:57:15.300 --> 01:57:17.300]  What was mixed in with it.
[01:57:17.300 --> 01:57:21.300]  Then sent the pants back with the hallway and took the evidence.
[01:57:21.300 --> 01:57:24.300]  Right out of order to see the evidence.
[01:57:24.300 --> 01:57:26.300]  And the prosecutors didn't want me to see the evidence.
[01:57:26.300 --> 01:57:28.300]  I had to go mop and comb it.
[01:57:28.300 --> 01:57:32.300]  Yes indeed, I had a right to see the evidence before it was revealed.
[01:57:32.300 --> 01:57:35.300]  They presented these underpants to the hallway.
[01:57:35.300 --> 01:57:39.300]  I said, what kind of evidence is that?
[01:57:39.300 --> 01:57:41.300]  They were underpants to the hallway.
[01:57:41.300 --> 01:57:44.300]  Of course the crime lab had it thrown away.
[01:57:44.300 --> 01:57:46.300]  The piece that they cut out.
[01:57:46.300 --> 01:57:47.300]  It was real.
[01:57:47.300 --> 01:57:52.300]  It was really hard to get it down because they didn't have any evidence.
[01:57:52.300 --> 01:57:55.300]  I happened to be going to New York and I took the underpants with me.
[01:57:55.300 --> 01:57:58.300]  And I went to the work lab.
[01:57:58.300 --> 01:58:08.300]  Where this man's name I now cannot remember who had shared in the Nobel Prize for his work on the RH Master.
[01:58:08.300 --> 01:58:15.300]  And he was one of the real premier investigators who feels blood.
[01:58:15.300 --> 01:58:17.300]  She's just bragging.
[01:58:17.300 --> 01:58:22.300]  She's very calmly talking about how she got this guy off who later turned out was guilty.
[01:58:22.300 --> 01:58:23.300]  She's real proud of it.
[01:58:23.300 --> 01:58:28.300]  Her whole her whole candidacy is built on the idea that we need to have a woman in office.
[01:58:28.300 --> 01:58:35.300]  And yet here's somebody who throws a 13 year old child under the bus and lets her violent rapist get away.
[01:58:35.300 --> 01:58:38.300]  It's just like she talks about, yeah, we need to look after the poor people.
[01:58:38.300 --> 01:58:43.300]  And yet she and the Clinton Foundation are getting a half a billion dollars from Goldman Sachs
[01:58:43.300 --> 01:58:46.300]  holding fundraising meetings in Goldman Sachs's office.
[01:58:46.300 --> 01:58:48.300]  The hypocrisy is just a mention.
[01:58:48.300 --> 01:58:53.300]  She wants to sick people on what's left of the middle class that actually is a ladder out of poverty.
[01:58:53.300 --> 01:58:56.300]  When she is literally, we've done the numbers on the superclass.
[01:58:56.300 --> 01:59:00.300]  It's point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero two three.
[01:59:00.300 --> 01:59:01.300]  Yeah.
[01:59:01.300 --> 01:59:04.300]  So it's this ultra elite that are anti free market.
[01:59:04.300 --> 01:59:09.300]  And they're literally blaming all this tyranny on capitalism when they're the opposite.
[01:59:09.300 --> 01:59:17.300]  Yeah, but if the people who are typical Democrat supporters, if they would just look at what she is doing and compare that.
[01:59:17.300 --> 01:59:18.300]  Yeah, and we're not even endorsing it.
[01:59:18.300 --> 01:59:19.300]  These are Republicans.
[01:59:19.300 --> 01:59:21.300]  We just better get something better here.
[01:59:21.300 --> 01:59:23.300]  We better get back to the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:59:23.300 --> 01:59:28.300]  And the Democratic Party right now is the most virulent cancer on the planet.
[01:59:28.300 --> 01:59:30.300]  It will turn into Hitler if it can.
[01:59:30.300 --> 01:59:35.300]  I mean, she's even putting out fascist posters now where she's like the Godfather.
[01:59:35.300 --> 01:59:42.300]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:59:42.300 --> 01:59:48.300]  The people who are typical Democrat supporters and info or store dot com with all the great products, supplements, water filters, the best quality products out there.

[01:59:54.300 --> 02:00:00.300]  From the water table to our soils, to the atmosphere itself.
[02:00:00.300 --> 02:00:04.300]  Our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day, but it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:00:04.300 --> 02:00:04.300]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:00:04.300 --> 02:00:09.540]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:00:09.540 --> 02:00:12.760]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:00:12.760 --> 02:00:16.860]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:00:16.860 --> 02:00:21.240]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:00:21.240 --> 02:00:26.640]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs
