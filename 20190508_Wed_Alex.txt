[00:00:09.148 --> 00:00:11.852]  It's Wednesday, May 8th, 2019.
[00:00:11.852 --> 00:00:14.415]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:14.415 --> 00:00:22.706]  And every broadcast, quite frankly, just gets more intense, more important than the last, with the quickening happening on this planet.
[00:00:24.548 --> 00:00:25.869]  So I'm going to air this special report.
[00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:27.991]  It's very key.
[00:00:27.991 --> 00:00:35.036]  And when we come back, I'm going to do my best with the dizzying amount of news and information that's all incredibly vital to cover it all.
[00:00:35.036 --> 00:00:42.762]  But quite frankly, as the show starts, I've been for hours this morning trying to figure out what I would say our top story is.
[00:00:42.762 --> 00:00:45.444]  And our top story isn't one particular article or development.
[00:00:46.244 --> 00:00:56.449]  Our top story is that civilization is in crisis, humanity is in crisis, and the globalists, the anti-human forces, are greasing the skids of that.
[00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.151]  But first, let's go to this important report that needs to be seen.
[00:01:01.151 --> 00:01:04.653]  DOJ's upcoming bombshell report on Comey's illegal activities.
[00:01:04.653 --> 00:01:06.233]  Has Obama freaking out?
[00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:07.294]  Another Greg Rees report.
[00:01:10.953 --> 00:01:27.595]  Ten years out of law school, 36-year-old James Comey joined the Clinton administration and acted as Deputy Special Counsel to the Senate Whitewater Committee during investigations for Whitewater, Filegate, and Chinagate, all of which the Clintons were let off the hook for.
[00:01:28.636 --> 00:01:40.662]  So it's no surprise that in July of 2016, Comey let Hillary off the hook again for violating federal law when she was caught using private servers for the transfer of classified material.
[00:01:40.662 --> 00:01:46.726]  Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information,
[00:01:47.606 --> 00:01:51.909]  Our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.
[00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:59.135]  Two months later, at an Ohio rally, Trump expresses his distrust in James Comey and the DOJ.
[00:01:59.135 --> 00:02:15.087]  After the FBI and Department of Justice whitewashed Hillary Clinton's email crimes, they certainly cannot be trusted to quickly or impartially investigate Hillary Clinton's new crimes, which happen all the time.
[00:02:17.014 --> 00:02:26.041]  Around this time, the unverified Steele dossier was used in a FISA submission to spy on the newly elected administration.
[00:02:26.041 --> 00:02:39.492]  The United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court was established under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to oversee requests for surveillance warrants against foreign spies inside the United States.
[00:02:40.573 --> 00:02:45.636]  NSA analyst Russ Tice called it a kangaroo court with a rubber stamp.
[00:02:45.636 --> 00:02:49.498]  And there has been growing criticism of the FISA Court since 9-11.
[00:02:49.498 --> 00:02:52.419]  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
[00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:53.340]  The FISA Court.
[00:02:54.727 --> 00:03:07.452]  We do respect the Fourth Amendment in this country and we issue warrants based on suspicion, but sometimes these warrants have to be issued by secret courts so we don't alert the suspects we're spying on.
[00:03:07.452 --> 00:03:16.155]  And these court proceedings are classified, which means, surprise, they don't appear in papers such as the New York Times.
[00:03:17.561 --> 00:03:23.223]  On May 9th of 2017, President Trump fires James Comey.
[00:03:23.223 --> 00:03:33.026]  Aloof and disgraced, James Comey begins a book tour and a strange habit of tweeting out reflective self-portraits.
[00:03:33.026 --> 00:03:37.487]  In January of 2018, InfoWars releases the secret FISA memo.
[00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.938]  In April of 2018, Comey comes under fire for leaking classified memos.
[00:03:45.938 --> 00:03:52.166]  And now that the Mueller witch hunt has ended, the tables are turning against Comey and the Deep State.
[00:03:52.166 --> 00:03:54.789]  There's another report that everybody has forgotten about.
[00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.031]  Involving James Comey alone.
[00:03:58.031 --> 00:04:00.011]  That will be out in two weeks.
[00:04:00.011 --> 00:04:03.272]  That report is going to be a bombshell.
[00:04:03.272 --> 00:04:06.532]  It's going to open up the investigation on a very high note.
[00:04:06.532 --> 00:04:08.973]  And there will be criminal referrals in it.
[00:04:08.973 --> 00:04:13.494]  James Comey, America's dirty cop, ate the soul of the FBI.
[00:04:13.494 --> 00:04:15.514]  He destroyed the FBI.
[00:04:15.514 --> 00:04:22.896]  And this little piece of paper, which is the FISA court ruling from 2017, is going to be their undoing.
[00:04:23.716 --> 00:04:28.338]  The attempted coup against President Trump is not over.
[00:04:28.338 --> 00:04:36.983]  But James Comey may be the first domino to fall in what patriots hope to be the dismantling of America's criminal deep state.
[00:04:36.983 --> 00:04:39.444]  For NewsWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:53.284]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, my head's spinning at this point, but I'll try the best job I can when we come back after this break to cover all this key information.
[00:04:53.284 --> 00:04:54.924]  I'm Alex Jones, NewsWires.com.
[00:04:54.924 --> 00:04:58.826]  The most banned sites in the world only get spread by word of mouth.
[00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.532]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[00:05:05.532 --> 00:05:14.075]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[00:05:14.075 --> 00:05:17.076]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[00:05:17.076 --> 00:05:18.816]  How can I solve that problem?
[00:05:18.816 --> 00:05:25.078]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[00:05:27.179 --> 00:05:32.503]  The Alexa Pure Breeze Groundbreaking Ion Cluster Air Filter Technology.
[00:05:32.503 --> 00:05:35.465]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[00:05:35.465 --> 00:05:39.087]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[00:05:39.087 --> 00:05:43.370]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.191]  I've got two in my home.
[00:05:45.191 --> 00:05:51.295]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[00:05:51.295 --> 00:05:52.136]  Don't live
[00:05:52.956 --> 00:05:57.022]  In a polluted major city in your home, have clean air.
[00:05:57.022 --> 00:06:03.129]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:05.833]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:05.833 --> 00:06:10.960]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:06:24.128 --> 00:06:28.691]  Wednesday, May 8th, 2019.
[00:06:28.691 --> 00:06:34.294]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:34.294 --> 00:06:37.056]  Well, there's no doubt we were right.
[00:06:37.056 --> 00:06:40.158]  And it really wasn't too hard to be right if you studied history.
[00:06:40.158 --> 00:06:46.602]  Big tech and corrupt governments for decades have been building systems of total absolute surveillance and control.
[00:06:48.582 --> 00:07:05.169]  They are competitively rolling out in the last decade devices in your homes that watch you and listen to you and track your every movement and then use that information against you in the marketplace to displace you and to create a post-human world where humans are obsolete.
[00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:07.970]  That is the Silicon Valley goal.
[00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:09.731]  Elon Musk and others like
[00:07:12.222 --> 00:07:21.348]  The writer of the big article, now almost 20 years ago, Why the Future Doesn't Need Us, in Wired Magazine, Bill Joy.
[00:07:21.348 --> 00:07:23.450]  They've all told you this.
[00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:33.056]  This is a very cold-blooded, psychopathic, sociopathic, robotic movement, pun intended against humanity.
[00:07:33.056 --> 00:07:38.000]  And of course, now that's all just admitted.
[00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:44.943]  But the AI has trouble understanding humor.
[00:07:44.943 --> 00:07:49.046]  And so do a lot of these soulless globalists.
[00:07:49.046 --> 00:08:03.076]  And so when they sell you on the idea that they're just censoring nationalists or right-wingers and mixing us in with all sorts of unsavory groups like child kidnappers and murderers, they're just setting the precedent for everybody else.
[00:08:03.076 --> 00:08:05.178]  And I know you know that.
[00:08:05.178 --> 00:08:06.759]  But everyone needs to understand something.
[00:08:08.086 --> 00:08:16.132]  This is already being used to gain markets, to consolidate control, to displace families and workers across the planet.
[00:08:16.132 --> 00:08:18.633]  And it's done so by design.
[00:08:18.633 --> 00:08:23.537]  And so it's been fundamentally built to be anti-human and abusive.
[00:08:23.537 --> 00:08:29.201]  And it was all built on denial of the surveillance when that was part of its basic infrastructure.
[00:08:29.201 --> 00:08:36.366]  And it was all built on the abuse of that information and abuse of that power toward now in the
[00:08:37.648 --> 00:09:02.532]  Middle of 2019, already close to middle of the year, already a good 40% in, we're being told that you can't send certain email links through your email, and that you can't say certain things over your digital phone, or that you
[00:09:04.741 --> 00:09:07.823]  Can't have certain phone service if you are a conservative.
[00:09:07.823 --> 00:09:10.284]  This is so incredibly dangerous.
[00:09:10.284 --> 00:09:13.386]  It's so incredibly organized.
[00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:19.089]  It's so incredibly premeditated and criminal.
[00:09:19.089 --> 00:09:25.733]  And it really is, out of everything going on, the front and center issue.
[00:09:25.733 --> 00:09:27.954]  Now remember, a few months ago they passed a law in Europe
[00:09:29.892 --> 00:09:37.137]  That you can be given jail time for memes if you didn't get copyright authorization from the holders first.
[00:09:37.137 --> 00:09:46.744]  Well, if you mix together four or five images, it's a new transformative work in European law, in US law, in Japanese law, you name it.
[00:09:46.744 --> 00:09:49.986]  And you have a right, if it's your free speech, to do it.
[00:09:49.986 --> 00:09:52.388]  But they're saying, no, we're going to use copyright.
[00:09:53.749 --> 00:09:58.890]  To silence you, even making a collage of images to try to put you in jail, to scare you.
[00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:02.131]  That's their way of banning it.
[00:10:02.131 --> 00:10:12.373]  In the United States, it still has some free speech, at least on paper, Instagram, now on my Facebook, to fact check and remove memes.
[00:10:12.373 --> 00:10:23.175]  So now they're saying if a meme isn't real, even though it's meant to be a joke, they're gonna take a joke and then say, oh, it's a piece of news, and then if it isn't real,
[00:10:24.346 --> 00:10:25.466]  They're going to ban it.
[00:10:25.466 --> 00:10:37.511]  The famous meme that we turned into a t-shirt of Trump as a Greek champion with the severed head of Medusa that happens to be Hillary.
[00:10:37.511 --> 00:10:44.734]  Are they going to fact check that and say Trump really didn't sever Hillary's head, Hillary really isn't a Titan Gorgon Medusa?
[00:10:47.598 --> 00:11:12.080]  Or, the new meme, are they gonna fact check that and say, Jones is not a king penguin, and Zuckerberg is not a giant lion seal, and he did not rape him, and Oliver Darcy and Brian Stelter, their heads weren't really on large albatrosses walking around watching the seal rape the penguin.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.162]  That was a meme we put up that's pretty hilarious.
[00:11:16.095 --> 00:11:23.613]  Again, they're trying to make humor illegal, and then they play these mind games and go, oh, that didn't really happen.
[00:11:23.613 --> 00:11:25.757]  Remember when Carpe Dantum?
[00:11:26.474 --> 00:11:33.479]  Put out the video that got like 100 million views last time I checked on three platforms of Joe Biden apologizing for groping everybody.
[00:11:33.479 --> 00:11:37.862]  And then the very same Joe Biden comes in behind him as a cutout and starts rubbing on him.
[00:11:37.862 --> 00:11:44.266]  Remember how the news said that that was fake and that it was a doctored video?
[00:11:44.266 --> 00:11:50.931]  ABC News, New York Times, CNN all said Trump tweeted a doctored fake video.
[00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:53.325]  No, it's called a joke.
[00:11:53.325 --> 00:12:02.269]  Everyone, including a three-year-old, would know it's like a cartoon, that it was Biden groping Biden, that that didn't really happen, that it's called humor.
[00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:16.954]  Again, PolitiFact, Washington Post, CNN, they all fact-check Trump when he said, we've got burgers mile high here at the Oval Office when he talked to a TV camera.
[00:12:16.954 --> 00:12:17.414]  Remember that.
[00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:25.194]  And they said the president lied, the hamburgers only went up like 300 feet.
[00:12:25.194 --> 00:12:27.155]  If you stacked all the hamburgers.
[00:12:27.155 --> 00:12:32.138]  It's called hyperbole.
[00:12:32.138 --> 00:12:48.989]  They know that, but see, they're waging war on language now, and common sense, and then saying, that's our excuse to take you down, because really the truth is, just like ancient kings that were corrupt, would find out if somebody was a jester in the town, making fun of them, they'd kill you!
[00:12:50.322 --> 00:13:04.634]  And so what they're saying is, you're not allowed to make fun of us, you're not allowed to make jokes out of all this, because you've been politically beating us, and so we're going to accelerate all the control and all the oppression and all the surveillance we already had in place.
[00:13:04.634 --> 00:13:10.098]  We're just going to use it now, a little bit earlier than we were, because you're beating us.
[00:13:10.098 --> 00:13:11.879]  Which is the good news.
[00:13:11.879 --> 00:13:15.943]  This is so criminal what they're doing, but no matter where you are in the world, this is being used against you.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.282]  Again, in China, you can't sit down with Winnie-the-Pooh of any type.
[00:13:20.282 --> 00:13:24.884]  All services have filters that scan Winnie-the-Pooh images of any type.
[00:13:24.884 --> 00:13:29.107]  Winnie-the-Pooh is banned in China because people make fun of the leader.
[00:13:29.107 --> 00:13:32.709]  Because in Chinese, they think he sounds like Winnie-the-Pooh.
[00:13:32.709 --> 00:13:34.130]  And his nickname is Winnie-the-Pooh.
[00:13:35.109 --> 00:13:36.990]  Or Christopher Robin.
[00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:40.652]  And again, Taiwanese emojis are banned inside China.
[00:13:40.652 --> 00:13:47.677]  For a few weeks they were banned, period, on iPhones, because Apple's based in China now, and said we'll ban that emoji of the Taiwanese flag.
[00:13:47.677 --> 00:13:51.979]  And again, maybe you don't care about Winnie the Pooh or the Taiwanese flag.
[00:13:51.979 --> 00:13:59.244]  The point is that these filters are in place, and now they're going to be used, and in America they said the first man to be banned is Alex Jones.
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.522]  And his website, InfoWars.com.
[00:14:02.522 --> 00:14:05.766]  And now, the letters started coming in today.
[00:14:05.766 --> 00:14:09.210]  I'm not at liberty to get to these yet, but will be announced in the next few days.
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:16.502]  The dangerous criminal Interpol G2 banking designation.
[00:14:16.502 --> 00:14:17.663]  So Paul's got the lawyers.
[00:14:17.663 --> 00:14:21.804]  He's filing today the first beginning of the suits with the government on Facebook.
[00:14:21.804 --> 00:14:22.484]  I'm forced to.
[00:14:22.484 --> 00:14:27.926]  I mean, it's going to happen because it's coming where I won't be able to get a plane ticket.
[00:14:27.926 --> 00:14:30.027]  In fact, they're saying this.
[00:14:30.027 --> 00:14:32.508]  I am listed as a terrorist right now.
[00:14:33.487 --> 00:14:35.309]  I told you this four months ago.
[00:14:35.309 --> 00:14:42.618]  We sent letters to G2, we sent letters to Interpol, we sent letters to the FBI, and just no response.
[00:14:42.618 --> 00:14:43.939]  But we have all the paperwork.
[00:14:43.939 --> 00:14:47.323]  Now Facebook, in the same order, now does banking.
[00:14:47.323 --> 00:14:49.125]  And in their press release, in the same order as G2,
[00:14:50.828 --> 00:14:54.670]  And the FBI and the Interpol, never been convicted, nothing.
[00:14:54.670 --> 00:15:02.375]  I am listed as a international arms dealer, an international terrorist, a child kidnapper, a child pornographer.
[00:15:02.375 --> 00:15:04.557]  This is what I'm listed as.
[00:15:04.557 --> 00:15:06.858]  I've never been convicted of any felony.
[00:15:06.858 --> 00:15:08.359]  I've been convicted of speeding.
[00:15:08.359 --> 00:15:10.240]  I mean, I've pled guilty to it.
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.962]  Thank God, I haven't probably got a ticket in 10 years.
[00:15:13.013 --> 00:15:16.276]  I've got a ticket for failure signal ride or something a few years ago.
[00:15:16.276 --> 00:15:18.697]  The point is, is that I'm not kidding.
[00:15:18.697 --> 00:15:20.038]  I'm not a victim here, folks.
[00:15:20.038 --> 00:15:22.420]  You're about to be victims.
[00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:25.042]  These people mean business.
[00:15:25.042 --> 00:15:26.103]  You understand?
[00:15:26.103 --> 00:15:33.689]  And they have hired all the SJWs everywhere to run MasterCard and run the big banks and run everything.
[00:15:33.689 --> 00:15:40.373]  And Paul Joseph Watson got notice today, we're not going to announce it yet, that he is officially a terrorist.
[00:15:40.373 --> 00:15:42.075]  And he's going to have everything taken away from him.
[00:15:42.813 --> 00:15:46.216]  But the UK government says they're getting ready to fine Facebook.
[00:15:46.216 --> 00:15:48.558]  But see, the banks don't care.
[00:15:48.558 --> 00:15:54.684]  This is all the big banks and Facebook working together to crush and put conservatives in electronic gulags.
[00:15:54.684 --> 00:15:56.526]  Hell, electronic concentration camps!
[00:15:59.554 --> 00:16:00.754]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[00:16:00.754 --> 00:16:04.695]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[00:16:04.695 --> 00:16:06.215]  I sued the IRS and won.
[00:16:06.215 --> 00:16:09.176]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[00:16:09.176 --> 00:16:14.737]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[00:16:14.737 --> 00:16:15.937]  I can help you, too.

[00:16:28.999 --> 00:16:35.362]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[00:16:35.362 --> 00:16:38.404]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[00:16:38.404 --> 00:16:43.967]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[00:16:44.307 --> 00:16:48.109]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[00:16:48.109 --> 00:16:49.370]  Was there ever a vote?
[00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:50.370]  Who do we fight for?
[00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:56.914]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.

[00:20:03.408 --> 00:20:06.011]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:32.008]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:32.008 --> 00:20:35.951]  So, whether you believe in the Bible or not, whether you believe in Revelation,
[00:20:38.516 --> 00:20:42.238]  There's a one world government where you have a mark on your hand or your head to buy and sell.
[00:20:42.238 --> 00:20:44.439]  You must submit to the beast system.
[00:20:44.439 --> 00:20:47.840]  You must follow the social and religious orders of the world government.
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:53.983]  You must bow down and worship the image of the beast that is in all homes and all public places.
[00:20:53.983 --> 00:20:59.346]  Describe as a living 3D giant that is in the center of towns.
[00:20:59.346 --> 00:21:03.548]  That is an AI god that you are meant to submit to.
[00:21:06.158 --> 00:21:10.181]  And you're allowed to live and be part of the system, but you've got to agree to be sterilized.
[00:21:10.181 --> 00:21:11.722]  You've got to agree to not have children.
[00:21:11.722 --> 00:21:13.583]  Only select people can do that.
[00:21:13.583 --> 00:21:16.605]  Most of the children will be humanoid in the future.
[00:21:16.605 --> 00:21:19.307]  They will not actually be of a mother and father.
[00:21:19.307 --> 00:21:22.289]  That's all being announced in textbooks.
[00:21:22.289 --> 00:21:24.030]  Babies are ugly.
[00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:25.351]  Parasite cancers.
[00:21:25.351 --> 00:21:35.758]  And national news everywhere hails the new Church of Satan as the new religion of America and opens up all these different offices across the country.
[00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:46.016]  It's a coming out of the evil, being poured out upon the land by the slaves of this system.
[00:21:46.016 --> 00:21:56.243]  And I'll be covering it all today, but the world government systems here, big tech is all basically coordinating to censor and track and control.
[00:21:56.243 --> 00:22:03.949]  And now across the board, with AI systems, Facebook, Instagram, Google, YouTube, Apple,
[00:22:05.404 --> 00:22:15.146]  They're all announcing we're going to control what you can say and what you can do in live time with AI filters.
[00:22:15.146 --> 00:22:26.009]  And just as Matt Dredge warned years ago, we will then be herded into digital ghettos and then into physical ghettos.
[00:22:26.009 --> 00:22:29.210]  They're also announcing Kamala Harris has given a speech.
[00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:29.890]  I've got it right here.
[00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:34.091]  One of the presidential candidates and a former vicious prosecutor.
[00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:42.094]  She has come out and said, we're going to ban people engaged in hate.
[00:22:42.094 --> 00:22:44.657]  That means criticism of her criminal activity.
[00:22:44.657 --> 00:22:48.860]  And that conservatism will be an act of domestic terrorism in the future.
[00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:52.923]  And that you will be locked up at the behest of her orders.
[00:22:52.923 --> 00:22:57.727]  And that's at her speech at the Detroit AACP.
[00:22:57.727 --> 00:22:58.428]  In AACP.
[00:22:59.991 --> 00:23:04.392]  Kamala Harris hints at government censorship of social media.
[00:23:04.392 --> 00:23:06.253]  No, that's not what she did.
[00:23:06.253 --> 00:23:09.914]  Big League politics is great, but she didn't hint at it.
[00:23:09.914 --> 00:23:19.016]  She declared that conservatives will be listed as terrorists and that they're going to strip big tech of their Section 230 where they have immunity.
[00:23:19.016 --> 00:23:21.177]  Well, they want to get rid of their own immunity.
[00:23:21.177 --> 00:23:26.258]  They want to be given new government superimmunity to shut down whoever they want and then have immunity from that.
[00:23:27.742 --> 00:23:35.848]  Just like vaccine makers have immunity from all the damage they cause, and there's no safety studies done, but you're just supposed to trust that.
[00:23:35.848 --> 00:23:42.653]  But don't forget, Instagram to fact check and remove memes.
[00:23:42.653 --> 00:23:46.817]  That's right, things that are funny, things that are jokes.
[00:23:46.817 --> 00:23:49.539]  Oh, you mean Hillary really isn't?
[00:23:49.539 --> 00:23:50.740]  Medusa?
[00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:54.583]  Oh, Snopes says that's a fake image.
[00:23:54.583 --> 00:23:57.405]  And you think I'm joking, that's what they're actually coming out and doing.
[00:23:59.198 --> 00:24:03.102]  Again, Trump didn't have Mile High's burgers at the White House.
[00:24:03.102 --> 00:24:05.745]  Trump didn't have Mile High burgers there.
[00:24:05.745 --> 00:24:06.746]  He lied to you.
[00:24:06.746 --> 00:24:20.200]  This is what they're doing, where they tell you you're a liar, and go through every phase of your life watching what you do, what you say, indexing it all, and then restricting you on your social score, aka the black mirror.
[00:24:21.783 --> 00:24:23.944]  We read articles about the social score before Black Mirror.
[00:24:23.944 --> 00:24:26.084]  People say, oh my god, they're building this off Black Mirror.
[00:24:26.084 --> 00:24:33.306]  No, Black Mirror was there to show you the future that was already in place in China.
[00:24:33.306 --> 00:24:36.347]  Twitter bans Jewish Trump supporter over AOC parody account.
[00:24:36.347 --> 00:24:42.849]  Says parody on the account, says parody on the video, says satire, and it's really funny.
[00:24:42.849 --> 00:24:46.750]  And she's a public figure.
[00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:47.650]  But it's banned.
[00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:49.711]  We played it yesterday, but let's play a new
[00:24:51.337 --> 00:25:00.945]  A new little meme piece that's out there on the web is Alex Jones, out there on Twitter, Alex Jones hacks Facebook.
[00:25:00.945 --> 00:25:04.227]  Now obviously it's my voice, it's not Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:25:04.227 --> 00:25:06.169]  Obviously we're not trying to deceive anyone.
[00:25:06.169 --> 00:25:16.197]  But if this gets picked up by the so-called mainstream news, because they're so deceptive, they will say, somebody tried to deceive people and put words in Zuckerberg's mouth!
[00:25:16.197 --> 00:25:18.839]  Because this is what they do.
[00:25:20.953 --> 00:25:22.755]  Incredibly dangerous.
[00:25:22.755 --> 00:25:24.437]  I can't believe the users trust me.
[00:25:24.437 --> 00:25:27.640]  They're a bunch of dumb effers.
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:31.183]  And now he's going to tell you whose name you can say and what website you can share.
[00:25:31.183 --> 00:25:33.085]  Oh, it's a private company.
[00:25:33.085 --> 00:25:33.466]  Yeah, right.
[00:25:33.466 --> 00:25:38.511]  Illegally selling all your data, listening to you inside your house, giving all the data to the leftist groups to control you.
[00:25:39.778 --> 00:25:45.580]  No, it's criminal, organized, racketeering, and this is the system coming into place.
[00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:47.621]  It's our job to inform people.
[00:25:47.621 --> 00:25:51.243]  Biblically, it's going to come into place for one hour.
[00:25:51.243 --> 00:25:57.385]  And biblically, one hour generally means, in the type of ages they're talking about it, you have to get into the deep analysis of it.
[00:25:57.385 --> 00:26:01.167]  It's very, the profane can't understand it.
[00:26:01.167 --> 00:26:01.807]  It's like coded.
[00:26:01.807 --> 00:26:03.228]  It really gets deep.
[00:26:03.228 --> 00:26:06.429]  But there's different arguments.
[00:26:06.429 --> 00:26:08.110]  One year generally means
[00:26:09.591 --> 00:26:11.813]  One day.
[00:26:11.813 --> 00:26:13.995]  One day means a year.
[00:26:13.995 --> 00:26:16.217]  And it depends on how you look at it.
[00:26:16.217 --> 00:26:18.719]  Let's hope it's not a decade or a hundred years.
[00:26:18.719 --> 00:26:24.624]  But the point is, the devil's given power for one hour.
[00:26:24.624 --> 00:26:27.507]  One hour usually means a year.
[00:26:27.507 --> 00:26:30.449]  One day usually means a hundred years.
[00:26:30.449 --> 00:26:33.352]  It's all open for interpretation, but it means a limited time.
[00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:37.312]  A limited time, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:37.312 --> 00:26:42.517]  But you better buckle yourselves in, because we're going to go into this, and you're going to see Satanism everywhere.
[00:26:42.517 --> 00:26:43.638]  They're going to be in your schools.
[00:26:43.638 --> 00:26:44.859]  They're going to be in private schools.
[00:26:44.859 --> 00:26:46.040]  They're going to be if you're homeschooled.
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:48.582]  They're going to come to your house and arrest you and take your kids.
[00:26:48.582 --> 00:26:49.723]  They're coming.
[00:26:49.723 --> 00:26:50.804]  They're coming.
[00:26:50.804 --> 00:26:51.544]  They're coming.
[00:26:51.544 --> 00:26:56.088]  And it's all going to be called liberal and liberation.
[00:26:56.088 --> 00:27:00.792]  From the left, it's free speech, but you won't have any speech.
[00:27:00.792 --> 00:27:01.793]  You won't have any speech.
[00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:07.621]  So, pure evil is being poured out upon the world.
[00:27:07.621 --> 00:27:18.346]  When we come back, I'll get to this meme that just got put out.
[00:27:18.346 --> 00:27:21.968]  But just, it's absolutely amazing to watch all this unfold.
[00:27:21.968 --> 00:27:27.251]  Oh, and all these other activists, and all these other writers, and all these other people are being banned.
[00:27:29.608 --> 00:27:35.093]  And as soon as conservatives announce speaking tours, they're banned off their banking, they're banned off their Instagram.
[00:27:35.093 --> 00:27:37.135]  It's all coordinated.
[00:27:37.135 --> 00:27:40.818]  Men rights activist, Roosh V, banned from Instagram.
[00:27:40.818 --> 00:27:43.240]  Chase Wepay, after announcing U.S.
[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:47.524]  speaking tour, after he was banned off of Amazon.
[00:27:47.524 --> 00:27:52.288]  And his books are just really pick-up artists, act confident type stuff.
[00:27:54.375 --> 00:27:56.717]  Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:56.717 --> 00:27:58.098]  But that's how all this works.
[00:27:58.098 --> 00:28:06.884]  Remember when Hillary Clinton said Peppa the Frog was a white supremacist image because she didn't like memes?
[00:28:06.884 --> 00:28:09.946]  She saw it here and there and wanted to say he was a white supremacist too.
[00:28:09.946 --> 00:28:14.089]  You know, Trump's a white supremacist, I'm a white supremacist, wouldn't you like to be a white supremacist too?
[00:28:14.089 --> 00:28:15.590]  I mean, it's just on and on.
[00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:22.275]  And so she branded the frog as a white supremacist, so the supposed owner of it sued me
[00:28:23.732 --> 00:28:32.057]  So they can put in the news that I was a white supremacist, see how that works, and then it turns out he didn't even own the frog.
[00:28:32.057 --> 00:28:36.179]  Well, I'm not at liberty to get to that, but ooh, things didn't go too well.
[00:28:36.179 --> 00:28:41.623]  Things haven't been going too well for Mr. Fury, what his lawyers told him.
[00:28:41.623 --> 00:28:42.583]  Wow.
[00:28:42.583 --> 00:28:46.265]  Shouldn't have told everybody that they could have the frog.
[00:28:46.265 --> 00:28:47.066]  Shouldn't have told everybody.
[00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:49.291]  Shouldn't have done that.
[00:28:49.291 --> 00:28:51.112]  Oh, and Big Bird?
[00:28:51.112 --> 00:28:52.033]  Mm-mm-mm.
[00:28:52.033 --> 00:28:53.234]  What about that?
[00:28:53.234 --> 00:28:55.215]  Is Big Bird yours too?
[00:28:55.215 --> 00:28:56.496]  Wait till all that comes out.
[00:28:56.496 --> 00:28:57.537]  Oh, we're winning.
[00:28:57.537 --> 00:28:58.318]  The enemy's losing.
[00:28:59.622 --> 00:29:01.584]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:29:01.584 --> 00:29:06.909]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:29:06.909 --> 00:29:08.491]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:29:08.491 --> 00:29:16.859]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:29:16.859 --> 00:29:22.545]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:29:22.705 --> 00:29:24.526]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:29:24.526 --> 00:29:26.687]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:29:26.687 --> 00:29:31.209]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:29:31.209 --> 00:29:33.390]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[00:30:03.727 --> 00:30:05.248]  During the fall, they'd have it during the winter.

[00:31:00.476 --> 00:31:02.899]  Stacy in the great state of Texas.
[00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:06.983]  In FEMA Region 6, you're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[00:31:19.677 --> 00:31:25.663]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins that don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural.
[00:31:25.663 --> 00:31:26.443]  I appreciate that.
[00:31:26.443 --> 00:31:28.025]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[00:31:28.025 --> 00:31:28.645]  Tell us about it.
[00:31:28.645 --> 00:31:29.406]  Well, it's really great.
[00:31:29.406 --> 00:31:30.707]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[00:31:30.707 --> 00:31:31.228]  I take it.
[00:31:31.228 --> 00:31:31.968]  It tastes good.
[00:31:31.968 --> 00:31:33.810]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:35.772]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[00:31:35.772 --> 00:31:39.235]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day, so I really like it.
[00:31:39.275 --> 00:31:42.098]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[00:31:42.098 --> 00:31:43.859]  They're known to turbocharge women.
[00:31:43.859 --> 00:31:45.941]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[00:31:45.941 --> 00:31:46.862]  So, yeah.
[00:31:46.862 --> 00:31:49.304]  Stamina, libido, energy.
[00:31:49.304 --> 00:31:52.127]  These are amazing things and ultimate female force.
[00:31:52.127 --> 00:31:53.268]  So I'm glad you plugged it.
[00:31:53.268 --> 00:31:55.089]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:31:59.841 --> 00:32:05.045]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[00:32:05.045 --> 00:32:13.611]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[00:32:13.611 --> 00:32:16.594]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[00:32:16.594 --> 00:32:18.335]  How can I solve that problem?
[00:32:18.335 --> 00:32:24.620]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[00:32:26.701 --> 00:32:32.024]  The Alexa Pure Breeze Groundbreaking Ion Cluster Air Filter Technology.
[00:32:32.024 --> 00:32:34.966]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[00:32:34.966 --> 00:32:38.568]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[00:32:38.568 --> 00:32:42.890]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:44.711]  I've got two in my home.
[00:32:44.711 --> 00:32:50.814]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[00:32:50.814 --> 00:32:51.635]  Don't live
[00:32:52.475 --> 00:32:56.538]  In a polluted major city, in your home, have clean air.
[00:32:56.538 --> 00:33:03.383]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:33:03.383 --> 00:33:06.025]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:22.264 --> 00:33:24.886]  Raw and unfiltered.
[00:33:24.886 --> 00:33:29.531]  It's the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:29.531 --> 00:33:30.613]  This is CNN.
[00:33:50.286 --> 00:33:57.315]  It's an incredibly big deal that Facebook is completely overhauling its mission and has a new mission.
[00:33:57.315 --> 00:34:01.080]  So, what is the new mission of Facebook?
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:05.185]  Yeah, we're going to start censoring pro-Trump news or news we don't like.
[00:34:05.185 --> 00:34:06.807]  Not even fake stuff, we're just going to censor.
[00:34:06.807 --> 00:34:08.469]  So how exactly do you do that?
[00:34:09.284 --> 00:34:12.788]  So I guess the message is to you, hey, it don't matter what's true.
[00:34:12.788 --> 00:34:16.071]  You keep your mouth shut or we're gonna call you Hitler.
[00:34:16.071 --> 00:34:23.078]  Take me inside Mark Zuckerberg's head to like the moment that you decided you needed to change Facebook's core mission.
[00:34:23.078 --> 00:34:27.743]  Was there an event that happened or was there just a moment that you said, we gotta change something?
[00:34:28.817 --> 00:34:41.948]  Obama put an internet kill switch in place in 2010 and then signed a bill right before he left office saying that the CIA would be over the media and over the Board of Governors of the FCC.
[00:34:41.948 --> 00:34:44.830]  I mean, this is crazy stuff and it's in the news.
[00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:46.451]  It's not like I'm saying it.
[00:34:46.451 --> 00:34:53.497]  What have you had to kind of learn from the spread of misinformation or what have you learned to make sure that people can really connect?
[00:34:54.540 --> 00:35:00.101]  It's not in the news, but corporations send each other communications, and they send stockholders information.
[00:35:00.101 --> 00:35:01.441]  And everything's there!
[00:35:01.441 --> 00:35:02.102]  Everything's there!
[00:35:02.102 --> 00:35:06.643]  I mean, you read the white papers today, it's like, we're preparing for a post-human world, and we're looking at the best way.
[00:35:06.643 --> 00:35:15.124]  Do we just kill everybody right away with the virus, or do we entertain them and then have them opt in to get more money up front, to then have the government euthanize them later?
[00:35:15.124 --> 00:35:18.605]  You keep hearing, we've never been more divided, we've never been more polarized.
[00:35:18.605 --> 00:35:22.626]  Was it the political climate that led to kind of this awakening?
[00:35:23.186 --> 00:35:25.027]  Let me give you the big news right now.
[00:35:25.027 --> 00:35:27.528]  Let me tell everybody the big news right now.
[00:35:27.528 --> 00:35:36.552]  If you think 14-year-old and 12-year-old news about cameras and microphones watching and listening to you, you're like, oh, there's nothing about me that's interesting.
[00:35:36.552 --> 00:35:40.274]  Just like people put stuff on Facebook when they're going out of town where they live and people rob them.
[00:35:40.274 --> 00:35:41.675]  It's not that you did something wrong.
[00:35:41.675 --> 00:35:43.896]  You told folks what you had in your house, where you lived.
[00:35:44.156 --> 00:35:46.077]  And where you were going for a week.
[00:35:46.077 --> 00:35:48.158]  Oh, you're going to Cancun for a week.
[00:35:48.158 --> 00:35:53.680]  You said where you lived and what you had in your house, and showed off the stuff you had, and then robbers robbed you.
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:55.321]  You're a dumbass!
[00:35:55.321 --> 00:35:56.941]  I don't say that meanly, it's true.
[00:35:56.941 --> 00:35:59.643]  Just like, oh, let the government know what I've got.
[00:35:59.643 --> 00:36:00.583]  I'm none of the time.
[00:36:00.583 --> 00:36:02.344]  As if the government's full of angels.
[00:36:02.344 --> 00:36:11.948]  Samsung and all these companies for a decade have been telling you they're doing this because they're selling the data on you and the intel on you into big algorithm systems.
[00:36:23.326 --> 00:36:32.409]  All right, folks, we're back live.
[00:36:32.409 --> 00:36:35.930]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:37.991]  Here's what's happening.
[00:36:37.991 --> 00:36:40.252]  I don't even know if I continue on doing the show at this point.
[00:36:40.252 --> 00:36:44.413]  I think I may just end the show right now, because things are so bad in this country.
[00:36:44.413 --> 00:36:48.915]  I think talking about it is almost a way of just making it a form of entertainment.
[00:36:49.827 --> 00:36:53.511]  I mean, I really, really, really do.
[00:36:53.511 --> 00:36:57.234]  We have to do some really, really drastic things.
[00:36:57.234 --> 00:37:01.778]  If you see any of these tech executives in person, I wouldn't try to run them out of restaurants.
[00:37:01.778 --> 00:37:06.223]  I wouldn't try to do what the Democrats have said do to us that are fighting back against the bullying.
[00:37:06.223 --> 00:37:11.307]  But I would definitely let them know that you're aware of their criminal activity and that they will be brought to justice.
[00:37:12.308 --> 00:37:14.970]  And if you live next door to him, you should let him know that.
[00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:17.171]  If you run into him, you should.
[00:37:17.171 --> 00:37:33.820]  If you can do anything to hurt their stocks, if you can do anything to let these criminals know, because they're consolidating power, and it's getting worse by the day, and we just have a general population of people that are in la-la land in this country and worldwide from all the entertainment.
[00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:36.481]  People are drunk from entertainment.
[00:37:36.481 --> 00:37:38.002]  They're just drunk from stimuli.
[00:37:39.184 --> 00:37:52.188]  In fact, I've seen a bunch of big studies that are common sense, but studies that came out recently showing that seeing all the simulated sex and violence and just regular things on television destroys real memories.
[00:37:52.188 --> 00:38:08.273]  Fake memories or memories of things that didn't happen are destroying our capacity to have any real memory about the real world or any real way to navigate the planet, to navigate what's happening on this actual world we live on.
[00:38:09.631 --> 00:38:12.633]  And again, all the metrics show that we're dying.
[00:38:12.633 --> 00:38:21.959]  Our IQs are lowering, our genetics are unraveling, our capacity to take action is faltering.
[00:38:21.959 --> 00:38:23.319]  We're dying.
[00:38:23.319 --> 00:38:24.740]  We're dying.
[00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:32.345]  And I went and saw a movie last night, and it was exactly what I thought it would be, and worse.
[00:38:32.345 --> 00:38:37.048]  So incredibly boring, so incredibly predictive, so pathetic.
[00:38:37.887 --> 00:38:44.772]  The people so weak and so soulless, slaves.
[00:38:44.772 --> 00:38:47.554]  And it's exactly what I thought it would be.
[00:38:47.554 --> 00:38:51.497]  It's exactly what I knew it was, following it in the real world.
[00:38:51.497 --> 00:38:53.158]  And it was a giant PR rollout.
[00:38:54.229 --> 00:38:55.750]  For satanism.
[00:38:55.750 --> 00:39:01.612]  And not for the fake atheistic satanism, where the atheists claim, oh, I'm really an atheist.
[00:39:01.612 --> 00:39:02.552]  Oh, sure you are.
[00:39:02.552 --> 00:39:04.213]  Yes, of course you are.
[00:39:04.213 --> 00:39:06.994]  These were actual devil worshippers.
[00:39:06.994 --> 00:39:11.315]  And by that, they see themselves as the devil and you as their food.
[00:39:11.315 --> 00:39:12.456]  It's a predatory thing.
[00:39:12.456 --> 00:39:15.317]  Do as thou wilt is the whole law.
[00:39:15.317 --> 00:39:17.958]  And just thank God I'm not with those people.
[00:39:17.958 --> 00:39:23.460]  But being in the theater and looking at the weak chicken neck people around me and watching their enjoyment,
[00:39:26.593 --> 00:39:29.095]  was soul-sucking.
[00:39:29.095 --> 00:39:34.801]  Like when you're in Los Angeles and feel the desperateness and the emptiness and the lostness.
[00:39:34.801 --> 00:39:36.883]  And the movie is Hail Satan.
[00:39:36.883 --> 00:39:39.765]  I'm going to talk about it later in the broadcast.
[00:39:39.765 --> 00:39:42.968]  But I knew what was coming because I've been around these people.
[00:39:42.968 --> 00:39:46.872]  A lot of them are wearing Antifa t-shirts, basically Antifa.
[00:39:46.872 --> 00:39:48.553]  Meth, meth, meth addict, Antifa.
[00:39:49.617 --> 00:40:00.845]  Super unhealthy, super depressed, super soulless, super third-weight, fourth-weight feminist, deep CIA demoralization operation.
[00:40:00.845 --> 00:40:01.606]  And I was watching it.
[00:40:03.294 --> 00:40:09.716]  And I just knew at some point they would say, babies aren't human, babies are scum, babies in the womb suck.
[00:40:09.716 --> 00:40:16.798]  And sure enough, women are empowered, babies suck, babies aren't human, this thing that we revere inside of the mother.
[00:40:16.798 --> 00:40:21.140]  But it's all, we're liberal, we care, we care about children though.
[00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:31.663]  And it's just all the bottom of the barrel of people that think they're going to be empowered by the system if they destroy themselves and others around them.
[00:40:33.939 --> 00:40:41.225]  And then there's kind of set up against well-meaning Christians that still don't understand the full magnitude of what they're facing.
[00:40:41.225 --> 00:40:44.108]  So I'll talk about that some later in the broadcast.
[00:40:44.108 --> 00:40:50.073]  But sure enough, I hadn't even done any searches yet.
[00:40:50.073 --> 00:40:56.819]  I hadn't done any searches yet for the stupid movie.
[00:40:58.857 --> 00:41:03.178]  And when I looked it up, it was all the same.
[00:41:03.178 --> 00:41:04.638]  97% positive rating Rotten Tomato.
[00:41:04.638 --> 00:41:12.760]  I mean, that's like saying a dead maggot has a 97% rating.
[00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:18.722]  And it was just all these super weak, impotent little chicken neck people.
[00:41:18.722 --> 00:41:18.822]  And
[00:41:20.953 --> 00:41:25.136]  It was the London Guardian, the New York Times, Washington Post, all the same thing.
[00:41:25.136 --> 00:41:26.797]  Oh my gosh, this is Satanism.
[00:41:26.797 --> 00:41:28.358]  It's America's new religion.
[00:41:28.358 --> 00:41:29.539]  Everyone's adopting it.
[00:41:29.539 --> 00:41:30.900]  It's so cool.
[00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:31.941]  It's so wonderful.
[00:41:31.941 --> 00:41:33.242]  Satanists are good.
[00:41:33.242 --> 00:41:35.604]  They're the good people Satan was lied about.
[00:41:35.604 --> 00:41:36.344]  They're loving.
[00:41:36.344 --> 00:41:37.605]  It's the Christians that are bad.
[00:41:37.605 --> 00:41:39.226]  It's the Christians that want to hurt babies.
[00:41:39.226 --> 00:41:42.148]  And of course, in the show, they talk about how much they hate babies.
[00:41:42.148 --> 00:41:47.973]  But it's all about inverting reality and gaslighting you by these horrible little wraiths
[00:41:49.537 --> 00:42:03.243]  Who try to be as wraith-like as possible and have no association with life, hoping to sucker in the giant hordes of jellyfish nerds that have been created at the universities.
[00:42:03.243 --> 00:42:06.045]  Oh, and then the director became a Satanist.
[00:42:06.045 --> 00:42:07.305]  Yeah.
[00:42:07.305 --> 00:42:08.466]  Became a Satanist.
[00:42:08.466 --> 00:42:08.966]  Right.
[00:42:08.966 --> 00:42:10.287]  Sure.
[00:42:10.287 --> 00:42:11.887]  Sure you did.
[00:42:11.887 --> 00:42:15.089]  And of course, these are just the Renfield ghouls.
[00:42:16.308 --> 00:42:19.730]  That are sent out to tell everybody, Oh, it's for atheists.
[00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:20.551]  It's for liberals.
[00:42:20.551 --> 00:42:21.752]  Yes.
[00:42:21.752 --> 00:42:21.992]  Yes.
[00:42:21.992 --> 00:42:24.433]  The left-hand path.
[00:42:24.433 --> 00:42:31.598]  And then you just look at how dead and miserable these people look and then making fun of dead babies, bodies and everything.
[00:42:31.598 --> 00:42:34.100]  And you just realize that my God.
[00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:38.671]  This country is on its last legs.
[00:42:38.671 --> 00:42:41.333]  The world is falling.
[00:42:41.333 --> 00:42:49.297]  And, of course, when it all goes down, you know those that have sown the wind reap the whirlwind.
[00:42:49.297 --> 00:42:52.378]  It's just illustrative.
[00:42:52.378 --> 00:42:53.719]  Uh-oh, I forgot.
[00:42:53.719 --> 00:42:56.040]  It's got them in schools with little children?
[00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:56.480]  Why not?
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:57.661]  They got the pedophiles in there with them.
[00:42:59.281 --> 00:43:08.589]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[00:43:08.589 --> 00:43:11.452]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[00:43:11.452 --> 00:43:17.498]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[00:43:18.158 --> 00:43:24.422]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globals tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[00:43:24.422 --> 00:43:30.707]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[00:43:30.707 --> 00:43:37.651]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[00:43:38.792 --> 00:43:51.822]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[00:43:51.822 --> 00:43:56.065]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[00:43:56.065 --> 00:43:58.767]  X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[00:43:59.542 --> 00:44:04.406]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[00:44:04.406 --> 00:44:13.874]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.
[00:44:13.874 --> 00:44:18.658]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.

[00:46:29.281 --> 00:46:31.864]  This is Secret 12, but twice as strong.
[00:46:31.864 --> 00:46:33.526]  So I called it Ultra 12.
[00:46:33.526 --> 00:46:36.389]  And we decided, I like your Secret 12 Plus.
[00:46:36.389 --> 00:46:39.432]  But they said, look, when you do Plus, people don't get that it means better and more.
[00:46:39.432 --> 00:46:40.193]  Just call it Ultra 12.
[00:46:40.193 --> 00:46:40.934]  Well, you know what?
[00:46:40.934 --> 00:46:42.255]  I don't like how the label's printed.
[00:46:42.255 --> 00:46:44.237]  And it just so happens it had already been labeled with the other one.
[00:46:44.237 --> 00:46:45.198]  We decided to change the name.
[00:46:45.198 --> 00:46:46.420]  So when you peel off the label...
[00:46:47.638 --> 00:46:51.343]  Underneath it, it's Secret 12+.
[00:46:51.343 --> 00:46:54.147]  Twice as strong, 50% off right now.
[00:46:54.147 --> 00:46:56.029]  Better than Secret 12 ever was.
[00:46:56.029 --> 00:47:02.798]  Infowarsstore.com, now back in stock after four months, sold out.
[00:47:02.798 --> 00:47:05.441]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:26.195 --> 00:47:29.077]  This country and the world's in a crisis.
[00:47:29.077 --> 00:47:30.818]  I know you don't need me to tell you that.
[00:47:30.818 --> 00:47:32.579]  And I don't tell you that to demoralize you.
[00:47:32.579 --> 00:47:35.400]  I tell you that because I believe in you and God believes in you.
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:36.301]  We got to get serious.
[00:47:36.301 --> 00:47:38.042]  We got to get focused.
[00:47:38.042 --> 00:47:40.583]  We got to stop rolling over to evil.
[00:47:40.583 --> 00:47:43.925]  Because let me tell you, it's crawling out of its holes.
[00:47:43.925 --> 00:47:47.567]  I'm going to cover this at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:47:47.567 --> 00:47:49.328]  I've said this a lot.
[00:47:49.328 --> 00:47:51.950]  I've known this for a long time.
[00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:55.112]  But going out and covering demonstrations around the country of the left
[00:47:56.115 --> 00:48:14.619]  I can tell you, not just here, but in Europe and many other areas, the actual operating system, like a computer program, like Windows 2000, of the Democratic Party is Satanism.
[00:48:14.619 --> 00:48:21.261]  And again, I remember, you know, three-star Air Force generals telling me that 20-something years ago, and I didn't believe it.
[00:48:22.515 --> 00:48:27.699]  I remember even though I grew up, there was a lot of that going on in Dallas and wealthy areas.
[00:48:27.699 --> 00:48:32.102]  These weren't white trash Antifa meth heads.
[00:48:32.102 --> 00:48:37.186]  These were rich people and this was more Luciferian, but it was the real deal.
[00:48:37.186 --> 00:48:44.331]  But even though I was around it, I still couldn't believe that it was this rampant.
[00:48:49.983 --> 00:48:54.107]  And that's what I'm going to be getting into at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:48:54.107 --> 00:49:05.359]  I meant to write some notes last night when I got home, or today, of watching Hell's Satan, this new movie.
[00:49:05.359 --> 00:49:07.521]  And it was just like, that's the Democrats.
[00:49:07.521 --> 00:49:10.865]  And the first five minutes in, I went, oh my gosh.
[00:49:12.243 --> 00:49:13.343]  It's the operating system.
[00:49:13.343 --> 00:49:17.265]  They're going to say this is the new religion of America and the democratic operating system.
[00:49:17.265 --> 00:49:21.726]  They're going to show all these Democrats that said, oh, I was an atheist, but now I'm a Satanist.
[00:49:21.726 --> 00:49:24.567]  And it's a tongue in cheek thing, but it's real.
[00:49:24.567 --> 00:49:27.348]  And then this is how it's all rolled out.
[00:49:27.348 --> 00:49:31.269]  And.
[00:49:31.269 --> 00:49:33.770]  It's all about killing babies after they're born.
[00:49:37.065 --> 00:49:45.973]  And they talk about how bad babies are, and how we need to kill them, and how they're scum, and how we need to stop putting them up on a pedestal, how we need to trample babies.
[00:49:45.973 --> 00:49:53.959]  And I was in this theater with all these Austin liberals, all these weak men, like squirming and drinking their beer and getting off of it.
[00:49:53.959 --> 00:49:56.501]  And I looked at all the men and women, they were all ugly.
[00:49:56.501 --> 00:49:59.824]  The men were all super weak.
[00:49:59.824 --> 00:50:01.866]  The weakest of the weak, the ugliest of the ugliest.
[00:50:01.866 --> 00:50:04.208]  These are Satan's minions.
[00:50:04.208 --> 00:50:05.349]  These are Satan's servants.
[00:50:11.939 --> 00:50:14.600]  We have to bring God back into America.
[00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:19.481]  We have to do it now.
[00:50:19.481 --> 00:50:27.843]  Because if we don't have God in America, the vacuum's open and in comes the worst scum you could ever imagine.
[00:50:27.843 --> 00:50:29.283]  I have stacks of news here today.
[00:50:29.283 --> 00:50:34.184]  Remember Little Desmond is amazing?
[00:50:35.424 --> 00:50:48.809]  Since he's five years old, he performs as a drag queen and does skits about taking ketamine and other date rape drugs with convicted killers on television.
[00:50:48.809 --> 00:50:51.070]  And they say on the TV show, I want you to be corrupted.
[00:50:51.070 --> 00:50:52.351]  Bring your children close to the TV.
[00:50:56.949 --> 00:51:00.350]  And all the convicted pedophiles they catch running these drag queen storytime for kids.
[00:51:00.350 --> 00:51:03.671]  Well now, Converse Shoes, it's all the same thing.
[00:51:03.671 --> 00:51:04.792]  It's all devil worship.
[00:51:04.792 --> 00:51:06.332]  It's all the same people.
[00:51:06.332 --> 00:51:08.093]  It's all the club kid stuff.
[00:51:08.093 --> 00:51:12.175]  That's in this Hell Satan movie.
[00:51:12.175 --> 00:51:15.136]  It's men dressed up like babies having sex with each other.
[00:51:15.136 --> 00:51:18.697]  It's all just mainlining pedophilia.
[00:51:18.697 --> 00:51:19.617]  That's what it is.
[00:51:19.617 --> 00:51:21.818]  It's Bathomette having sex with her children.
[00:51:21.818 --> 00:51:23.239]  That's the bottom of the barrel.
[00:51:23.239 --> 00:51:24.239]  That's where the rat hole leads.
[00:51:25.953 --> 00:51:31.295]  They're total destruction.
[00:51:31.295 --> 00:51:35.076]  Several little children under me.
[00:51:35.076 --> 00:51:38.537]  Jesus wept.
[00:51:38.537 --> 00:51:40.458]  And that's where these people are going.
[00:51:40.458 --> 00:51:41.738]  That's who they are.
[00:51:41.738 --> 00:51:48.401]  That's what they want to do.
[00:51:48.401 --> 00:51:49.481]  And we have to stand against them.
[00:51:50.794 --> 00:51:57.555]  I'm going to get into a bunch of other issues next hour on Trump and his tax returns and what's really behind that.
[00:51:57.555 --> 00:52:02.476]  Trump's noble moment, waiving executive privilege on Mueller's report, something that no other president's ever done.
[00:52:02.476 --> 00:52:09.678]  And the situation with Iran and the situation on this school getting attacked by a Trump hater that wanted to kill Christians.
[00:52:09.678 --> 00:52:12.618]  You'll see that story leave the news very, very quickly.
[00:52:12.618 --> 00:52:14.498]  And so much more today.
[00:52:14.498 --> 00:52:17.399]  This poor little black girl missing down in Houston.
[00:52:18.899 --> 00:52:21.501]  When I first heard about it, I said, that story sounds outlandish.
[00:52:21.501 --> 00:52:24.642]  I bet the dad's going to end up being the main suspect.
[00:52:24.642 --> 00:52:25.923]  That was the first day it happened.
[00:52:25.923 --> 00:52:27.624]  I didn't say that on air.
[00:52:27.624 --> 00:52:29.645]  I didn't say Smollett Day went on air.
[00:52:29.645 --> 00:52:34.268]  And now he's the person of interest, and the story's not adding up, and the story's totally changed.
[00:52:34.268 --> 00:52:36.949]  But see, you're not supposed to question things when they don't make sense.
[00:52:36.949 --> 00:52:40.672]  You're supposed to do what you're told.
[00:52:40.672 --> 00:52:48.136]  And I've got a lot more coming up in the next hour as well, but here's the final equation.
[00:52:49.505 --> 00:53:09.232]  When we don't value human life and we don't stand up for each other for standards of truth and justice and fight for it, evil every time comes in and takes over because there is a large percentage of people who are followers and they will follow evil if they believe that that is the way they're going to succeed.
[00:53:09.232 --> 00:53:13.493]  And once you open up Pandora's box, it's like opening a gateway to hell.
[00:53:13.493 --> 00:53:16.374]  And that gateway is open right now.
[00:53:24.070 --> 00:53:26.311]  They're not coming for your children.
[00:53:26.311 --> 00:53:30.631]  They've already got your children in most cases.
[00:53:30.631 --> 00:53:32.572]  So we're going to break it all down coming up today.
[00:53:32.572 --> 00:53:35.713]  Very, very serious broadcast.
[00:53:35.713 --> 00:53:37.373]  The enemy is highly funded.
[00:53:37.373 --> 00:53:38.773]  We are not.
[00:53:38.773 --> 00:53:44.895]  I try to make it easy to support us by having the best products you're going to find out there.
[00:53:46.860 --> 00:53:49.581]  Pro is their largest stainless steel countertop unit.
[00:53:49.581 --> 00:53:52.662]  Great for RVs, great for homes, great for offices.
[00:53:52.662 --> 00:53:57.003]  It is the best filter, gravity-fed filter, out of hundreds in the world that have been tested.
[00:53:57.003 --> 00:53:59.183]  The highest testing rate.
[00:53:59.183 --> 00:54:01.024]  The highest.
[00:54:01.024 --> 00:54:03.404]  Hundreds and hundreds of chemicals that come up zero.
[00:54:03.404 --> 00:54:07.926]  Hundreds and hundreds of chemicals that come up, you know, zero, zero, zero, zero, point.
[00:54:07.926 --> 00:54:10.106]  It's the best, and it has the highest volume.
[00:54:10.106 --> 00:54:12.607]  There's some other units out there that are as good, but they have almost no volume.
[00:54:13.737 --> 00:54:16.379]  And most units just take out the bad taste and do nothing.
[00:54:16.379 --> 00:54:24.945]  It's the lowest price ever sold because the AlexaPure company produced a giant mass of them.
[00:54:24.945 --> 00:54:31.969]  And because they know they get secondary marketing from us when I just plug AlexaPure as the best, they think they get as many sales off that as they get from me selling it.
[00:54:31.969 --> 00:54:33.831]  I am the biggest distributor of their system in the world.
[00:54:33.831 --> 00:54:33.851]  $199.95.
[00:54:33.851 --> 00:54:37.293]  They're normally $350 retail, usually sell them about $275.
[00:54:41.952 --> 00:54:49.706]  Ladies and gentlemen, you need to get one of these for your children, for yourself, for your preschool, for your church, whatever the case is.
[00:54:49.706 --> 00:54:51.088]  It does over 10,000 gallons.
[00:54:51.088 --> 00:54:52.831]  The replacement filters are very inexpensive.
[00:54:52.831 --> 00:54:53.773]  We sell those as well.
[00:54:55.029 --> 00:55:03.493]  Up on the site, up on InfoWarsTore.com, we have the Mike Adams breakdown with the test he did, plus other tests, so you can see the testing for yourself.
[00:55:03.493 --> 00:55:09.736]  Some other great filters that we sell as well that are right up there with Alexa Pure, like Pro Pure, and others that also test just as good.
[00:55:09.736 --> 00:55:11.257]  InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:55:11.257 --> 00:55:14.459]  Now, that said, also, we've been sold out for five months of Secret 12.
[00:55:24.236 --> 00:55:31.843]  And I made a big year contract out to get a better deal, and we reformulated it with the highest quality methylcobalamin that there is.
[00:55:32.967 --> 00:55:34.988]  You put it under your tongue, that's how you're able to absorb more of it.
[00:55:34.988 --> 00:55:38.509]  If you want, just gulp it down, but you only get a few percentage points that way.
[00:55:38.509 --> 00:55:40.390]  It's got to be under the tongue.
[00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:42.551]  Second best way to have it, the other way is injectable.
[00:55:42.551 --> 00:55:44.551]  Got to get that from a doctor, but it's the same stuff.
[00:55:44.551 --> 00:55:46.312]  Medical grade, medical bottleman.
[00:55:46.312 --> 00:55:49.433]  Don't inject it, so it's not, you know, this is not approved for that.
[00:55:49.433 --> 00:55:51.134]  It's the same stuff.
[00:55:51.134 --> 00:55:57.937]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, 50% out of the gates, Secret 12.
[00:55:57.937 --> 00:56:00.998]  Now, Secret 12 sold out, so this is now known as Ultra 12.
[00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:04.541]  Because I'm not going to just call it Secret 12+.
[00:56:04.541 --> 00:56:05.361]  People don't get it.
[00:56:05.361 --> 00:56:07.082]  It's twice as much Methylcobalamin.
[00:56:07.082 --> 00:56:10.183]  It's twice as strong for the same price.
[00:56:10.183 --> 00:56:11.804]  And we're doing it 50% off.
[00:56:11.804 --> 00:56:15.346]  You're getting very close to our cost at that because I want you to see how amazing it is.
[00:56:15.346 --> 00:56:17.887]  You saw the thousands of five-star reviews for Secret 12.
[00:56:17.887 --> 00:56:21.228]  This is Secret 12, just twice as strong.
[00:56:21.228 --> 00:56:22.849]  Ultra 12.
[00:56:22.849 --> 00:56:24.630]  Ultra 12.
[00:56:24.630 --> 00:56:26.411]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:56:26.411 --> 00:56:27.271]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:56:27.271 --> 00:56:28.151]  You want real energy?
[00:56:28.151 --> 00:56:28.872]  You want real focus?
[00:56:30.265 --> 00:56:32.946]  So I started taking Iodine and Secret 12 five, six years ago.
[00:56:32.946 --> 00:56:36.247]  Another group said this would happen.
[00:56:36.247 --> 00:56:37.328]  I had sunspots.
[00:56:37.328 --> 00:56:37.868]  I like the sun.
[00:56:37.868 --> 00:56:38.488]  I like to fish.
[00:56:38.488 --> 00:56:39.828]  I like to get outdoors.
[00:56:39.828 --> 00:56:40.589]  I like to garden.
[00:56:40.589 --> 00:56:41.969]  I can be down.
[00:56:41.969 --> 00:56:46.211]  I can go out and take my shirt off and water the plants for an hour or whatever with the kids in the yard.
[00:56:46.211 --> 00:56:47.611]  Do a little bit of gardening.
[00:56:47.611 --> 00:56:48.592]  I just feel energized again.
[00:56:48.592 --> 00:56:50.172]  That's my Prozac.
[00:56:50.172 --> 00:56:53.593]  And I would still get sunspots.
[00:56:53.593 --> 00:56:55.394]  95% of the sunspots went away when I went on.
[00:56:56.969 --> 00:57:00.010]  True Vitamin B12, Methylcobalamin, and X2.
[00:57:00.010 --> 00:57:03.311]  But that's why you've got to remember to take your iodine, or the X2 type.
[00:57:03.311 --> 00:57:04.972]  I'm telling you, the other stuff will eat holes in your stomach.
[00:57:04.972 --> 00:57:06.352]  This is the pure stuff.
[00:57:06.352 --> 00:57:07.693]  And your Methylcobalamin.
[00:57:07.693 --> 00:57:10.694]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.

[00:57:31.084 --> 00:57:32.625]  And they're coming.
[00:57:32.625 --> 00:57:34.246]  So we've got to push back.
[00:57:34.246 --> 00:57:36.668]  And yes, the Bible's coming true.
[00:57:36.668 --> 00:57:38.849]  They're going to win major battles.
[00:57:38.849 --> 00:57:39.670]  And have their time.
[00:57:39.670 --> 00:57:42.031]  But then we will win the war.
[00:57:42.031 --> 00:57:43.713]  We will win the war.
[00:57:43.713 --> 00:57:46.534]  But we've got to get as many souls as we can now.

[00:58:50.586 --> 00:58:54.169]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:58:54.169 --> 00:58:55.951]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:58:55.951 --> 00:59:07.220]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:59:08.001 --> 00:59:17.168]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:59:17.168 --> 00:59:22.953]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:59:22.953 --> 00:59:28.237]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:59:28.237 --> 00:59:30.479]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[00:59:30.839 --> 00:59:32.560]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:42.568]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:59:42.568 --> 00:59:45.211]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:59:45.211 --> 00:59:53.918]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:59:53.918 --> 00:59:56.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:01.015 --> 01:00:01.095]  Yeah.
[01:00:30.669 --> 01:00:41.398]  I was just talking to one of the crew members and he pointed out he went and saw In Game, no not the film I made 11 years ago, about a planetary extinction program.
[01:00:41.398 --> 01:00:45.201]  I know this is a universal extinction program movie.
[01:00:45.201 --> 01:00:48.004]  I've read the synopsis of it.
[01:00:48.004 --> 01:00:51.406]  But Matt was saying that full grown men were crying.
[01:00:51.406 --> 01:00:56.531]  Yeah, the last time I went and saw an Avengers movie, I forget the name of it, it was like 3 years ago,
[01:00:57.717 --> 01:01:02.422]  And it cut to what looked like video game battles.
[01:01:02.422 --> 01:01:04.484]  It was kind of like the first Hobbit was pretty good, the new one.
[01:01:04.484 --> 01:01:07.687]  And then by the Five Armies one, it was like video game.
[01:01:07.687 --> 01:01:13.372]  They got so cheap, like they had live action video game people fighting.
[01:01:13.372 --> 01:01:16.495]  And they got so cheap with the CG.
[01:01:16.495 --> 01:01:18.878]  So the last Avengers movie I watched
[01:01:20.435 --> 01:01:23.097]  Cause you know, they've had some of those Marvel movies where they actually have characters that are pretty good.
[01:01:23.097 --> 01:01:24.798]  Usually when they make the first one, it's good.
[01:01:24.798 --> 01:01:30.121]  Like Guardians of the Galaxy, the first one, even though it's got the pro-pedophilia director, was a pretty entertaining film.
[01:01:30.121 --> 01:01:32.142]  Developed the characters, had some funny things.
[01:01:32.142 --> 01:01:33.923]  Was pretty decent.
[01:01:33.923 --> 01:01:35.964]  You go see the next one, it gets worse, it gets worse.
[01:01:35.964 --> 01:01:37.365]  But the one I saw about the Avengers was...
[01:01:39.218 --> 01:01:44.261]  Or somehow, like, part of the planet's getting lifted up in Russia and it's gonna kill everybody in the city and they're all having this battle.
[01:01:44.261 --> 01:01:46.722]  It was just unwatchable.
[01:01:46.722 --> 01:01:50.184]  It's like Fast and Furious 7 was the one I saw.
[01:01:50.184 --> 01:01:51.325]  First Fast and Furious was pretty good.
[01:01:51.325 --> 01:01:53.386]  It was about people racing cars.
[01:01:53.386 --> 01:02:04.132]  Fast and Furious, I think it was 7, they drive cars down a mountain for 30 minutes running into boulders and jumping off cliffs and none of their tires blow out.
[01:02:04.132 --> 01:02:06.514]  I mean, the Dukes of Hazzard, they'd have a stuntman.
[01:02:06.514 --> 01:02:08.275]  People, by the way, died in some of those stunts.
[01:02:09.514 --> 01:02:12.016]  Famous stuntman would die in stunts.
[01:02:12.016 --> 01:02:22.944]  Jumping over rivers with the General Lee, man, that's a real car jumping over, and they would destroy the car when it went across.
[01:02:22.944 --> 01:02:31.151]  But, I mean, you go see, like, and I don't see it like it's fantasy, but... It's crazy.
[01:02:33.632 --> 01:02:37.834]  And the public seems to like things that are totally fantasy land.
[01:02:37.834 --> 01:02:46.978]  So the thing that Matt was saying earlier is that the new gods for America and the world are Thor.
[01:02:46.978 --> 01:02:52.601]  So I guess we have the Norse gods back and, you know, he's kind of the good god versus the bad god Thanos.
[01:02:52.601 --> 01:02:55.602]  And so we go back to all this.
[01:02:55.602 --> 01:02:56.283]  And then meanwhile,
[01:02:57.472 --> 01:03:10.222]  There's people that have taken on the archetype of Satan, and they want to come into school, and they want to talk to your kids, without your consent, and they want to talk about how worthless babies are, and how, let's just kill them.
[01:03:10.222 --> 01:03:17.327]  Oh, but there's no God, there's no energy, and then these people look like they had their souls sucked out.
[01:03:17.327 --> 01:03:26.694]  They're just like a little dead fish, laying in the sun, that's already had like ants eat all the flesh off of, and it's just kind of scales and a rotten eyeball.
[01:03:28.106 --> 01:03:36.150]  And you're like, uh, the people ushering me to my table for dinner look like they had their soul ripped out their hind end.
[01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:39.071]  I don't think I want to be a part of this religion.
[01:03:39.071 --> 01:03:52.998]  I like the one that when you actually follow it, you get giant and glistening buildings, beautiful architecture, life extension technology, beautiful families, wonderful children, gorgeous art, just incredible systems.
[01:03:52.998 --> 01:03:54.299]  I don't worship ugliness.
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:59.721]  But that's what these people do.
[01:03:59.721 --> 01:04:12.225]  And they always want to make it uglier, and uglier, and uglier, and uglier, because they're ugly at a spiritual level, and they want to project their hate of themselves onto you.
[01:04:12.225 --> 01:04:19.008]  And they want to make their behavior more and more outrageous, like serial killers do, so they get caught, so you stop them.
[01:04:19.008 --> 01:04:22.549]  They want you to stop them.
[01:04:22.549 --> 01:04:24.030]  And we are.
[01:04:24.030 --> 01:04:24.490]  Don't worry.
[01:04:26.684 --> 01:04:28.244]  Because God's going to stop them.
[01:04:28.244 --> 01:04:29.164]  But I want to explain.
[01:04:29.164 --> 01:04:54.709]  The soullessness of the left-hand path Democrats, the lowest of the low, needed to see the twisted, ugly, hunchback, beyond sub-minion, glorified in a ridiculous film, to believe that they're powerful, to be sucked in by the real Satanists, to be sucked dry even further, and then exploited against the youth.
[01:04:58.516 --> 01:05:02.301]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, knew that they canned food during the falls.
[01:05:02.301 --> 01:05:04.544]  They'd have it during the winter.
[01:05:04.544 --> 01:05:07.487]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFootwearStore.com.
[01:05:07.487 --> 01:05:11.533]  With MFootwear Select, it's the full spectrum of my Patriot Supply.
[01:05:13.106 --> 01:05:22.251]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.

[01:05:54.651 --> 01:05:57.533]  High quality, storable foods powered by my Patriot Supply.
[01:06:05.559 --> 01:06:16.165]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:16.165 --> 01:06:18.287]  Okay.
[01:06:18.287 --> 01:06:28.653]  We're into the second hour, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:28.653 --> 01:06:34.256]  And everybody and their dog is talking about Donald John Trump's tax returns.
[01:06:36.121 --> 01:06:37.644]  Now why have they been obsessed with that?
[01:06:37.644 --> 01:06:45.321]  Because they know full well that Trump's been quite public about this since the mid-1990s.
[01:06:48.001 --> 01:07:07.567]  That many times when you do a big expansion of real estate, and especially if you expand those developments of hotels and golf courses and living spaces, condos, that if a market goes down for a while, it could take a decade until you stop losing money.
[01:07:09.957 --> 01:07:13.480]  That's why during boom times, you always see all the buildings start going up.
[01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:15.142]  And when you're not in a boom time, you don't see that.
[01:07:15.142 --> 01:07:23.470]  That's why suddenly in a city, you might see 5 cranes, 10 cranes, 20 cranes, a big Manhattan, 50 cranes.
[01:07:23.470 --> 01:07:30.056]  But when you're in a recession, you don't see any cranes unless it's a repair crane, because you better not start construction during that, because you don't know when you're going to come out of it.
[01:07:31.223 --> 01:07:42.210]  So people go get loans, and then they build, and then until the company starts making money, you don't pay taxes.
[01:07:42.210 --> 01:07:48.034]  Now, I never did stuff like that with our little operation, because we just have Infowars.
[01:07:48.034 --> 01:07:51.656]  We just have free speech systems, and so it's one company.
[01:07:51.656 --> 01:08:00.422]  But the way everybody else does it is, they make a film, they make a corporation, say if you're a filmmaker like I am, and then if that film loses money, they just write that corporation off.
[01:08:01.809 --> 01:08:09.452]  I just make a film, and then it's just part of the overall operation, because we see it as a loss anyways, because it's just meant to get the information out.
[01:08:09.452 --> 01:08:10.872]  That's a different philosophy.
[01:08:10.872 --> 01:08:15.074]  But if you're in real estate, it's all about leveraging debt.
[01:08:15.074 --> 01:08:24.898]  It's all about going sometimes five, 10 years, not making a profit, and then making huge profits after that, but then leveraging that again into new projects that go into debt, so you don't pay the taxes.
[01:08:24.898 --> 01:08:29.079]  You hear about General Electric and Microsoft and Apple paying zero tax.
[01:08:29.079 --> 01:08:30.420]  They manipulate all that as well.
[01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:30.980]  They're offshore.
[01:08:32.227 --> 01:08:34.388]  And they don't really build much infrastructure here.
[01:08:34.388 --> 01:08:37.869]  Trump builds service infrastructure.
[01:08:37.869 --> 01:08:49.233]  So years ago on The Apprentice, I have the clip right here, Trump came out and talked about losing billions in the very period that they're now talking about.
[01:08:49.233 --> 01:08:53.495]  This is Trump, talks about losing billions in the 1990s.
[01:08:55.970 --> 01:09:02.633]  New York, my city, where the wheels of the global economy never stop turning.
[01:09:02.633 --> 01:09:11.736]  A concrete metropolis of unparalleled strength and purpose that drives the business world.
[01:09:11.736 --> 01:09:13.837]  Manhattan is a tough place.
[01:09:13.837 --> 01:09:16.458]  This island is the real jungle.
[01:09:16.458 --> 01:09:20.039]  If you're not careful, it can chew you up and spit you out.
[01:09:20.039 --> 01:09:23.000]  But if you work hard, you can really hit it big.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.601]  And I mean really big.
[01:09:32.114 --> 01:09:36.418]  My name's Donald Trump, and I'm the largest real estate developer in New York.
[01:09:36.418 --> 01:09:50.490]  I own buildings all over the place, model agencies, the Miss Universe pageant, jetliners, golf courses, casinos, and private resorts like Mar-a-Lago, one of the most spectacular states anywhere in the world.
[01:09:51.170 --> 01:09:53.332]  But it wasn't always so easy.
[01:09:53.332 --> 01:09:56.915]  About 13 years ago, I was seriously in trouble.
[01:09:56.915 --> 01:09:59.177]  I was billions of dollars in debt.
[01:09:59.177 --> 01:10:01.239]  But I fought back, and I won.
[01:10:01.239 --> 01:10:02.440]  Big league.
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:03.721]  I used my brain.
[01:10:03.721 --> 01:10:05.563]  I used my negotiating skills.
[01:10:05.563 --> 01:10:07.164]  And I worked it all out.
[01:10:07.164 --> 01:10:12.669]  Now my company's bigger than it ever was, and stronger than it ever was, and I'm having more fun than I ever had.
[01:10:17.423 --> 01:10:29.450]  So the Democrats know all this about Trump, and they know that, if anything, Trump's not being disingenuous here, because I've read some of his books, and I've read some of Kiyosaki's books he wrote with him.
[01:10:29.450 --> 01:10:37.154]  When you're doing real estate on this grand scale and building all these buildings, you better, again, they're each in their own corporation.
[01:10:38.376 --> 01:10:45.284]  So the ones that are losing money until they make money are losing money, and the ones that are making money, yeah, then you leverage into something else.
[01:10:45.284 --> 01:10:53.013]  Because if you were paying off what you really made as one company, well then things that failed could bring you down.
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:11:00.603]  Or things that succeeded, even though you had things that were failing, would have to pay for the things that were failing.
[01:11:00.603 --> 01:11:01.664]  See how that works?
[01:11:01.664 --> 01:11:04.825]  But then once the companies become profitable, then you pay the taxes.
[01:11:04.825 --> 01:11:12.769]  Why should you pay taxes on a building that you just built a few years before, that you owe hundreds of millions of dollars on, that you've just finally filled up with tenants?
[01:11:12.769 --> 01:11:14.090]  No, it takes time to do that.
[01:11:14.090 --> 01:11:17.972]  Anybody knows that about an operation.
[01:11:17.972 --> 01:11:22.314]  I've put into InfoWars, and what we've done in 24 years,
[01:11:24.249 --> 01:11:28.490]  Conservatively, I've done the math before.
[01:11:28.490 --> 01:11:35.413]  It's about a year ago, but we've put over $200 million into this operation.
[01:11:35.413 --> 01:11:40.114]  Oh yeah, probably 30-something million in bandwidth and web hosting.
[01:11:40.114 --> 01:11:45.896]  I mean, it costs money to make money, but my mission is not to make money.
[01:11:45.896 --> 01:11:50.798]  It's nothing wrong with making money, but I'm trying to change the world and get a message out.
[01:11:50.798 --> 01:11:53.319]  So again, I fly coach a lot of the time.
[01:11:54.107 --> 01:11:57.729]  Well, it's not going to get a good deal, because I want to put the money back into the operation.
[01:11:57.729 --> 01:11:59.410]  Yeah, I live in a nice four-bedroom house.
[01:11:59.410 --> 01:12:00.391]  I got a swimming pool.
[01:12:00.391 --> 01:12:03.633]  I got a decent $60,000 car, but that's not my God.
[01:12:03.633 --> 01:12:10.938]  Now, Trump's got a brand of this flamboyant, you know, fake-it-till-you-make-it type stuff, where folks want to go and feel like they're in a glitzy place.
[01:12:10.938 --> 01:12:11.538]  That's great.
[01:12:11.538 --> 01:12:12.319]  It's marketing.
[01:12:12.319 --> 01:12:14.420]  His airplanes, his helicopters, all of it.
[01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:15.521]  Makes perfect sense.
[01:12:15.521 --> 01:12:16.421]  He's a glitzy guy.
[01:12:16.421 --> 01:12:17.862]  Beautiful, you know, wife.
[01:12:17.862 --> 01:12:19.243]  Makes sense.
[01:12:19.243 --> 01:12:19.884]  That's not what I'm doing.
[01:12:21.008 --> 01:12:26.010]  I am in the trenches, building an operation, but I know how businesses work.
[01:12:26.010 --> 01:12:34.254]  If you die, like his dad would have, with 30-something big buildings and golf courses and stuff, the government would have taken half of it.
[01:12:34.254 --> 01:12:45.439]  So you're absolutely right that Fred Wolf, from the time his son was born, and his daughters, and his other son, was putting money into the company in their name.
[01:12:45.439 --> 01:12:47.140]  They didn't get it until he died.
[01:12:49.002 --> 01:12:50.103]  But of course he was doing that.
[01:12:50.103 --> 01:12:51.504]  That's what you do.
[01:12:51.504 --> 01:12:58.410]  I put money in my children's accounts, not a lot compared to those guys, but money so they can have college or medical stuff in the future.
[01:12:58.410 --> 01:12:59.511]  Something happens to me?
[01:12:59.511 --> 01:13:01.974]  This is how business is done.
[01:13:01.974 --> 01:13:03.175]  This is totally standard.
[01:13:03.175 --> 01:13:05.877]  And I'm not defending Trump over this.
[01:13:05.877 --> 01:13:08.620]  I'm defending reality.
[01:13:08.620 --> 01:13:12.403]  But you just heard him say, I almost went under in the early 1990s.
[01:13:12.403 --> 01:13:13.044]  He didn't just
[01:13:14.255 --> 01:13:26.178]  Leverage things he didn't just write off stuff where he was losing because of some casinos and things he did almost lose So again The idea is he's not a successful businessman
[01:13:27.392 --> 01:13:34.779]  Of course there's people like Zuckerberg worth $76 billion off a big pump-and-dunk Bilderberg surveillance scam thing.
[01:13:34.779 --> 01:13:40.124]  And of course you got Apple with all its slave factories in China, trillion dollar company and hundreds of billions for its owners.
[01:13:40.124 --> 01:13:46.751]  Trump has made his money off golf courses and hotels and condos and casinos and restaurants and stuff like that.
[01:13:46.751 --> 01:13:48.453]  And he hires a lot of people.
[01:13:48.453 --> 01:13:50.535]  I see that as pretty moral compared to the globalists.
[01:13:50.535 --> 01:13:51.716]  Trump doesn't own any slave factories.
[01:13:52.984 --> 01:13:54.725]  But it's how they try to deceive you.
[01:13:54.725 --> 01:14:02.751]  They keep telling you for years, when we get his tax returns from these years, we're going to show you that he's a big loser.
[01:14:02.751 --> 01:14:12.478]  Okay, well Trump came back and he ran for the first time ever for office and won and beat you, the whole deep state, the whole corporate media, Silicon Valley, pledging to deliver it all to Hillary.
[01:14:13.393 --> 01:14:15.875]  So does that make me like Trump more or less?
[01:14:15.875 --> 01:14:17.296]  It makes me like him more.
[01:14:17.296 --> 01:14:20.318]  Don't you like me more because I've been fighting so hard not giving up?
[01:14:20.318 --> 01:14:25.182]  I like you more because I know what you go through supporting us and supporting America.
[01:14:25.182 --> 01:14:26.523]  We're fighters.
[01:14:26.523 --> 01:14:28.624]  We're not giving in to all this crap.
[01:14:28.624 --> 01:14:36.150]  But the idea that Trump's hiding something or he's a scammer or all this, they get the rest of his tax returns.
[01:14:36.150 --> 01:14:40.553]  They're going to harass everybody he's in business with, everybody he's got contracts with.
[01:14:40.553 --> 01:14:42.735]  Believe me, I've been experiencing it in my own life.
[01:14:45.575 --> 01:14:51.280]  That's what these mafia people do, is they persecute, they harass, they threaten, they bully.
[01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:55.123]  So let me tell you why Trump's trying to keep his tax returns secret.
[01:14:55.123 --> 01:15:03.469]  He has to put in, as he said, hundreds and hundreds of tax returns every year on each business, each company, each operation.
[01:15:03.469 --> 01:15:05.591]  That's how all the other companies operate.
[01:15:07.498 --> 01:15:21.084]  In Hollywood, every new movie of production houses, that's why it has all those different cards at the front, or all the different companies, people involved, it's all divided up, all the liabilities divided up, because of all the lawyers and lawsuits.
[01:15:21.084 --> 01:15:28.087]  And so they get his tax returns, in the modern time, they're going to use it as a bombing run, as a targeting operation.
[01:15:30.444 --> 01:15:31.625]  To know who to hit.
[01:15:31.625 --> 01:15:32.846]  To know who to harass.
[01:15:32.846 --> 01:15:35.728]  Do you know the level of harassment Trump associates get?
[01:15:35.728 --> 01:15:37.669]  Believe me, I'm seen as a Trump associate.
[01:15:37.669 --> 01:15:39.550]  It's been intense.
[01:15:39.550 --> 01:15:41.411]  But it just makes me know I'm right about these crooks.
[01:15:41.411 --> 01:15:42.812]  They gotta be defeated.
[01:15:42.812 --> 01:15:43.693]  Alright, we're gonna come back.
[01:15:43.693 --> 01:15:45.074]  I've got more on this.
[01:15:45.074 --> 01:15:48.276]  I'm gonna shift gears as portable missing girl in Houston.
[01:15:48.276 --> 01:15:52.178]  I'm gonna get into the latest on Brennan and others caught spying and lying to Congress.

[01:18:29.761 --> 01:18:31.422]  So I called it Ultra 12.
[01:18:31.422 --> 01:18:34.284]  And we decided, I like your Secret 12 Plus.
[01:18:34.284 --> 01:18:37.326]  But they said, look, when you do Plus, people don't get that it means better and more.
[01:18:37.326 --> 01:18:38.087]  Just call it Ultra 12.
[01:18:38.087 --> 01:18:38.848]  Well, you know what?
[01:18:38.848 --> 01:18:40.148]  I don't like how the label's printed.
[01:18:40.148 --> 01:18:42.090]  And it just so happens it had already been labeled with the other one.
[01:18:42.090 --> 01:18:43.091]  We decided to change the name.
[01:18:43.091 --> 01:18:44.292]  So when you peel off the label...
[01:18:45.532 --> 01:18:49.234]  Underneath it, it's Secret 12+.
[01:18:49.234 --> 01:18:52.034]  Twice as strong, 50% off right now.
[01:18:52.034 --> 01:18:53.935]  Better than Secret 12 ever was.

[01:20:01.350 --> 01:20:03.941]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:33.655 --> 01:20:39.198]  Let me just recap what I was getting into in the last segment, then I'm going to get into all the other news.
[01:20:39.198 --> 01:20:51.985]  Again, I know our audience is mainly nationalistic, conservative, free market, and right from hard-working, red-blooded, blue-collar folks that keep this country going, right up to some of the richest people in the country that are patriots.
[01:20:51.985 --> 01:20:55.707]  There's not a lot of the ultra-rich that are patriots, because most of them got it through the system.
[01:20:55.707 --> 01:20:57.928]  But Trump's somebody that made it actually through services.
[01:21:00.325 --> 01:21:10.209]  Trump's tax returns are amongst the most voluminous and complex in the world, because real estate tax returns are the most complex.
[01:21:10.209 --> 01:21:17.933]  Because each property is its own entity, whether it's having a profit or a loss, and you never want to mix them all in together.
[01:21:18.673 --> 01:21:20.294]  For liability and for so many reasons.
[01:21:20.294 --> 01:21:21.415]  I already laid all that out.
[01:21:21.415 --> 01:21:23.696]  And anybody that knows basic business knows this.
[01:21:23.696 --> 01:21:28.719]  Most of our listeners are going, yes, and next you're going to tell us how to tie our shoelaces.
[01:21:28.719 --> 01:21:31.640]  Remember, the broadcast is not just for our listeners.
[01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:33.702]  You know more than I do, most of you.
[01:21:33.702 --> 01:21:47.710]  It's your job to get this feed out to the average leftist that actually believes socialism works and believes they're going to get free health care, free living wage, free education, free housing, free, free, free, free.
[01:21:48.683 --> 01:21:51.044]  So they're running around saying Trump is this idiot.
[01:21:51.044 --> 01:21:53.426]  He lost a billion dollars from 1985 to 1991.
[01:21:53.426 --> 01:21:58.309]  Yeah, he lost a billion dollars because of new construction.
[01:21:58.309 --> 01:22:01.551]  He started up and he had some casino problems, but he made it back.
[01:22:01.551 --> 01:22:03.372]  But again, that's the deception here.
[01:22:03.372 --> 01:22:04.352]  That Trump's a loser.
[01:22:04.352 --> 01:22:05.413]  He didn't want to win.
[01:22:05.413 --> 01:22:06.313]  He's a grifter.
[01:22:06.313 --> 01:22:07.234]  He's a scammer.
[01:22:07.234 --> 01:22:08.635]  That was the headline on CNN this morning.
[01:22:09.747 --> 01:22:12.929]  Trump has his Emperor's New Clothes moment.
[01:22:12.929 --> 01:22:20.173]  You know the Emperor's New Clothes parable, where these scammers come to town and they say, only nobles can see this golden silk that we spend.
[01:22:20.173 --> 01:22:21.994]  And so they spend this beautiful jacket.
[01:22:21.994 --> 01:22:25.256]  They have this woman with them that acts like a con artist and says, oh, it's so beautiful.
[01:22:25.256 --> 01:22:26.356]  The king can't see it.
[01:22:26.356 --> 01:22:28.157]  The emperor can't see it.
[01:22:28.157 --> 01:22:34.401]  So the emperor thinks, well, I better say I see it or they'll think I'm not the emperor.
[01:22:36.089 --> 01:22:39.932]  Well, finally, he's completely butt-naked in a parade except for underwear.
[01:22:39.932 --> 01:22:43.395]  He's given him half the wealth of the kingdom to spend the secret silk.
[01:22:43.395 --> 01:22:48.179]  And a three-year-old steps forward and laughs and says, look, the king has no clothes.
[01:22:48.179 --> 01:22:50.500]  The emperor has no clothes.
[01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:55.785]  What's called the emperor has no clothes or the emperor's new clothes is the original old fable name.
[01:22:55.785 --> 01:22:56.545]  In fact, look that up.
[01:22:56.545 --> 01:22:58.407]  Is that old English or old French?
[01:22:58.407 --> 01:22:59.187]  I think it's like 500 years old.
[01:23:00.939 --> 01:23:04.842]  Let's look up the Providence of the Emperor's New Clothes.
[01:23:04.842 --> 01:23:08.084]  So they're saying Trump has no clothes.
[01:23:08.084 --> 01:23:16.950]  Really, I thought the private Federal Reserve being set up in 1913, 106 years ago, being private run for profit, I thought it had no clothes.
[01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:19.851]  It's Danish author Hans Christensen Andersen.
[01:23:19.851 --> 01:23:22.613]  I guess the guy that gave us the Little Mermaid.
[01:23:22.613 --> 01:23:24.114]  So there you go.
[01:23:24.114 --> 01:23:25.975]  That's only a couple hundred years old.
[01:23:25.975 --> 01:23:28.717]  But a lot of his stuff was based on parables that were already out there.
[01:23:28.717 --> 01:23:29.398]  But whatever, I'm wrong.
[01:23:30.216 --> 01:23:31.237]  I like the fact check stuff.
[01:23:31.237 --> 01:23:32.117]  I'm going from memory here.
[01:23:32.117 --> 01:23:35.460]  But it's an old parable.
[01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:36.680]  I'm not just defending Trump.
[01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:38.301]  I'm defending reality.
[01:23:38.301 --> 01:23:40.843]  Trump's delivered on a lot of what he said he'd do.
[01:23:40.843 --> 01:23:45.046]  The globalists have delivered on almost nothing.
[01:23:45.046 --> 01:23:49.589]  And they just continue to sit there and say, there is no border.
[01:23:49.589 --> 01:23:51.570]  There is no caravan.
[01:23:51.570 --> 01:23:52.611]  There is no crisis.
[01:23:52.611 --> 01:23:53.632]  And they say that for a year.
[01:23:53.632 --> 01:23:57.474]  And then when that doesn't work, they go, oh my gosh, it's the worst crisis we've ever seen.
[01:23:57.474 --> 01:23:59.856]  And it's Donald, John Trump's fault.
[01:24:01.766 --> 01:24:05.949]  Then they've got the other emperor's new clothes that Donald Trump said all Mexicans are criminals.
[01:24:05.949 --> 01:24:07.270]  Never said anything like that.
[01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:08.951]  Or that Alex Jones is a white supremacist.
[01:24:08.951 --> 01:24:18.858]  I have a stack of articles here today in the London Guardian and all over the world saying Alex Jones is a white supremacist.
[01:24:18.858 --> 01:24:26.943]  And Nigel Farage, leading his new Brexit party that's already bigger than UKIP, is now a white supremacist because he hangs out with Alex Jones.
[01:24:26.943 --> 01:24:29.025]  It's just total fraud.
[01:24:29.025 --> 01:24:30.866]  They should be so discredited by this.
[01:24:34.775 --> 01:24:41.300]  And a word to the wise for Hope Not Hate and Facebook and all this, Watson is planning to take legal action.
[01:24:41.300 --> 01:24:41.640]  He has to.
[01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:43.161]  He's doing it with his own money.
[01:24:43.161 --> 01:24:44.942]  He's really upset.
[01:24:44.942 --> 01:24:51.047]  And as I mentioned at the start of the show, I'll get into this more later, they are openly announcing all over the news, now that I told you.
[01:24:51.047 --> 01:24:54.269]  Kamala Harris said it as well in a NAACP meeting yesterday.
[01:24:54.269 --> 01:25:03.096]  She said, we're going to list conservatives and nationalist haters, she says, as terrorists and we're going to take your internet ID away.
[01:25:04.204 --> 01:25:08.066]  So they're setting up an internet ID and then you can have it taken away.
[01:25:08.066 --> 01:25:09.486]  And what is Facebook saying?
[01:25:09.486 --> 01:25:14.308]  You can't promote Alex Jones or we'll take your ID away on Facebook.
[01:25:14.308 --> 01:25:19.851]  They're getting you ready for it all.
[01:25:19.851 --> 01:25:27.234]  And yes, Paul has now tweeted about this interesting message I received from the high-powered law firm in London.
[01:25:27.234 --> 01:25:31.296]  If PJW sues, Discovery would likely begin with light
[01:25:33.134 --> 01:25:37.356]  The Entry Corporation decision making process that led to the purge.
[01:25:37.356 --> 01:25:41.538]  Internal standards, emails, meeting notes, presentations, you name it.
[01:25:41.538 --> 01:25:46.100]  If it turns out Facebook is banning based on ideology, the entire world would change.
[01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:46.921]  Which they already are.
[01:25:46.921 --> 01:25:49.642]  We already know what's going on internally.
[01:25:49.642 --> 01:25:59.867]  Because I happen to have some intel here that ties into intel we already had and why they're trying to race
[01:26:02.133 --> 01:26:06.737]  And why they're going as fast as they can to have A.I.
[01:26:06.737 --> 01:26:10.319]  do all the censoring, but humans still have to oversee it because A.I.
[01:26:10.319 --> 01:26:12.461]  can't understand memes.
[01:26:12.461 --> 01:26:16.564]  Guess what I have here?
[01:26:16.564 --> 01:26:18.366]  I always say I'm gonna do something and I don't do it.
[01:26:18.366 --> 01:26:20.888]  You guys remind me.
[01:26:20.888 --> 01:26:26.012]  Star of the Next Hour, we'll have Dan Lyman on it.
[01:26:26.012 --> 01:26:27.193]  115.
[01:26:27.193 --> 01:26:30.015]  From EuropeWars.com, the amazing developments there.
[01:26:30.015 --> 01:26:31.036]  I'm going to cover this.
[01:26:32.372 --> 01:26:34.313]  At the start of the next hour.
[01:26:34.313 --> 01:26:35.254]  And you're not going to believe it.
[01:26:35.254 --> 01:26:38.716]  Well, you are going to believe it.
[01:26:38.716 --> 01:26:44.199]  But do you know what's happening to the people that have to censor this show?
[01:26:44.199 --> 01:26:46.840]  Can you imagine?
[01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:50.442]  I was told this by executives and then I saw some news admitting it, but not saying my name.
[01:26:50.442 --> 01:26:53.104]  And then this obviously breaks it down from PBS.
[01:26:58.618 --> 01:26:58.818]  Yes.
[01:27:12.833 --> 01:27:16.596]  They are grabbing them in these facilities and taking them to mental institutions.
[01:27:16.596 --> 01:27:22.401]  So, so, the, yes, Big Tech is an actual cult, folks.
[01:27:22.401 --> 01:27:23.582]  It's SJW cults.
[01:27:23.582 --> 01:27:26.605]  Just like Kanye said, I like Trump, they threw him in a mental institution.
[01:27:26.605 --> 01:27:40.897]  They're Baker acting people at Facebook and at Twitter and other places that when they tell them I'm a Nazi and then they go watch years of my show, these people can absolutely finally find their soul and go, oh my God, Alex Jones didn't do any of this stuff.
[01:27:42.065 --> 01:27:45.668]  And other people they're watching, just like in the lives of others.
[01:27:45.668 --> 01:27:53.873]  It's based on a composite for stories where the Stasi guy is spying on people and he watches them commit suicide because of what the party's doing to them.
[01:27:53.873 --> 01:28:00.258]  And he watches, you know, women committing suicide and he watches the party leaders making women have sex with them to have a job.
[01:28:00.258 --> 01:28:01.438]  And he just totally freaks out.
[01:28:01.438 --> 01:28:03.840]  He can't do it anymore.
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:06.542]  Well, these people actually are in our private messages.
[01:28:06.542 --> 01:28:07.763]  They're on our phones, man!
[01:28:09.517 --> 01:28:10.679]  They're reading everything.
[01:28:10.679 --> 01:28:13.703]  These are intelligence officers of the big tech.
[01:28:13.703 --> 01:28:15.104]  They're watching you in live time.
[01:28:15.104 --> 01:28:16.046]  They're doing stuff.
[01:28:16.046 --> 01:28:16.867]  The NSA did it.
[01:28:16.867 --> 01:28:18.188]  They go to prison like that!
[01:28:21.069 --> 01:28:32.975]  And the word is that they then start spying on the employees, monitoring them, and actually have private eyes that spy on them and spy on all their devices.
[01:28:32.975 --> 01:28:35.536]  And what do you think happens once they find out they're being spied on?
[01:28:35.536 --> 01:28:38.277]  They convert back to Americana, just like that.
[01:28:38.277 --> 01:28:39.098]  Just like Winston.
[01:28:39.798 --> 01:28:45.365]  Who is based on the real Orwell in MI6, OSS, at the BBC.
[01:28:45.365 --> 01:28:47.468]  And that whole book isn't about the Soviet Union.
[01:28:47.468 --> 01:28:52.275]  It's about where he thought England would go in the future under SJW communism.
[01:28:52.275 --> 01:28:54.698]  Stay with us as we go inside the Church of Satan.
[01:28:57.850 --> 01:29:02.933]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[01:29:02.933 --> 01:29:08.276]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the Alt-Left Sanctuary State until one day I chose to lead my family to freedom.
[01:29:08.276 --> 01:29:16.340]  Today we live on a sustainable 20-acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden, and homeschool our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.

[01:29:27.168 --> 01:29:31.031]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[01:29:31.031 --> 01:29:36.035]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?

[01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:00.841]  I want to say brain force is great.
[01:31:00.841 --> 01:31:02.743]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[01:31:02.743 --> 01:31:03.343]  It is.
[01:31:03.343 --> 01:31:08.227]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[01:31:08.227 --> 01:31:09.568]  The fish oil is better than it.
[01:31:09.568 --> 01:31:11.329]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[01:31:11.329 --> 01:31:13.871]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[01:31:13.871 --> 01:31:15.513]  Brain, body, heart.
[01:31:15.513 --> 01:31:16.974]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[01:31:16.974 --> 01:31:18.335]  You've got the children's.
[01:31:18.335 --> 01:31:19.456]  You've got the adults.
[01:31:19.456 --> 01:31:20.457]  You've got the krill oil.
[01:31:20.457 --> 01:31:23.439]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really
[01:31:23.539 --> 01:31:27.762]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oils is the best, and it'll give you the damn burps.
[01:31:27.762 --> 01:31:28.623]  And I'm sorry.
[01:31:28.623 --> 01:31:29.603]  You want something like this?
[01:31:29.603 --> 01:31:30.584]  You don't get stuff for free.
[01:31:30.584 --> 01:31:32.506]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[01:31:32.506 --> 01:31:33.726]  It's so good, in my view.
[01:31:33.726 --> 01:31:35.768]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[01:31:35.768 --> 01:31:42.152]  When I eat five caplets of krill oil before I go to bed, I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[01:31:42.152 --> 01:31:46.716]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[01:31:49.673 --> 01:31:55.705]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[01:31:55.705 --> 01:31:56.407]  I just can't do it!

[01:33:01.374 --> 01:33:18.682]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:18.682 --> 01:33:23.604]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:27.777 --> 01:33:28.898]  I know what they'll find.
[01:33:28.898 --> 01:33:29.899]  It's in their mind.
[01:33:29.899 --> 01:33:40.686]  It's what they want to believe.
[01:33:40.686 --> 01:33:57.137]  Well, the bottom-feeding, lowest-of-the-low Satanist that worked with Hollywood and the real Satanist to produce Hell, Satan got one thing right in their film, and that's when Abraham is going to kill his own son.
[01:33:59.195 --> 01:34:03.118]  That God gave him to show total and complete loyalty.
[01:34:03.118 --> 01:34:06.941]  That it's God that does the killing.
[01:34:06.941 --> 01:34:10.164]  And God that delivers the vengeance.
[01:34:10.164 --> 01:34:15.088]  And God that demands blood.
[01:34:15.088 --> 01:34:20.292]  But God demands blood of the strong in the battle against evil.
[01:34:20.292 --> 01:34:22.794]  And God demands sacrifice.
[01:34:22.794 --> 01:34:25.036]  Not hedonism, not worship of yourself.
[01:34:26.499 --> 01:34:33.263]  And those of you that continue to seek after the empowerment of yourself only, will never find God.
[01:34:33.263 --> 01:34:41.529]  As the thunder claps above my head, rage through the sky.
[01:34:41.529 --> 01:34:45.451]  Those that seek power do not receive real power.
[01:34:45.451 --> 01:34:50.615]  Those that seek God, find God.
[01:34:50.615 --> 01:34:54.117]  And those that do not know God, laugh.
[01:34:57.469 --> 01:35:00.152]  Because they are fools.
[01:35:00.152 --> 01:35:03.716]  Now, I want to be 100% clear.
[01:35:03.716 --> 01:35:10.044]  Hail Satan is a masterwork of evil.
[01:35:10.044 --> 01:35:12.446]  It is done like it's a joke at first.
[01:35:13.570 --> 01:35:37.976]  And funny, and they're just atheists, and this is all silly, and they're just First Amendment advocates that are fighting so hard to make sure these crazy right-wing Christians don't destroy our wonderful pluralistic society that was America, founded by our Christian and theist forebearers.
[01:35:37.976 --> 01:35:39.076]  And I thought I'd go see it.
[01:35:39.994 --> 01:35:45.817]  Because I was already familiar with the satanic temples activities and the people involved in all of it.
[01:35:45.817 --> 01:36:04.949]  And that it was a big Hollywood PR rollout to make satanism, a modern pop satanism, a religious organizational system around which they could try to organize now
[01:36:06.004 --> 01:36:19.130]  The majority that says they're not religious, but who in their iconography, in their logos, in their action, wear the banner of slaves of Satan.
[01:36:19.130 --> 01:36:22.051]  They're not actual Satanists.
[01:36:22.051 --> 01:36:34.316]  These are the people that wear the regalia, the saturnalia of blood to be fed to rats.
[01:36:36.112 --> 01:36:45.139]  So they are simply the blood enticement at the opening of the gate.
[01:36:45.139 --> 01:36:48.622]  They think they're feeding children in, they themselves are fed in.
[01:36:48.622 --> 01:36:51.984]  So they're simply the enticement of the chumming of the water.
[01:36:51.984 --> 01:37:02.533]  These are all the lowest of the low, no discernment, called by their father the devil like moths to a fetid flame.
[01:37:02.533 --> 01:37:04.815]  So, pulling back,
[01:37:05.865 --> 01:37:06.646]  I knew immediately.
[01:37:06.646 --> 01:37:07.366]  I told my wife.
[01:37:07.366 --> 01:37:09.708]  I said, I haven't read the synopsis of this film, but I know who the people are.
[01:37:09.708 --> 01:37:13.051]  I said, it'll all be how it's a joke, all how they're atheists.
[01:37:13.051 --> 01:37:23.599]  It'll be a fundraising movement to launch them nationwide and worldwide as a new system to counter the threat of authoritarian Christianity.
[01:37:23.599 --> 01:37:25.440]  They'll also talk about the Satanism...
[01:37:27.364 --> 01:37:32.212]  Craze is what it really was and backlash or hysteria of the 1980s.
[01:37:32.212 --> 01:37:33.795]  And she's like, oh no, it's a joke.
[01:37:33.795 --> 01:37:35.738]  I heard it's a joke from my friends.
[01:37:35.738 --> 01:37:37.000]  And I said, no, it's not a joke.
[01:37:39.642 --> 01:37:45.727]  And five minutes of the movie, I lean over and I go, see, now, soon they'll tell you actually a bunch of us really are into the occult.
[01:37:45.727 --> 01:38:07.546]  And you look at these people, they look so damned, so upset, so scared, so weak, so grasping, and it's all SJW, third wave feminism, babies are bad, put them on a pedestal, they're pieces of crap, get in there and kill that baby in the womb, women, show your real power, show us who you are, I mean, this is just,
[01:38:08.126 --> 01:38:23.631]  For soulless leftists that have three or four college loans, never got the job they wanted, they're on a bunch of Prozac, they play video games all day, they're freaked out, they're waddling around, they don't believe in God, they don't believe in the spiritual realm, they've been left wide open, and now there's the deception.
[01:38:23.631 --> 01:38:25.712]  Come to us.
[01:38:25.712 --> 01:38:27.433]  We look like you.
[01:38:27.433 --> 01:38:35.776]  We're ugly, we're nerdly, we're obese, we're stupid, we're fake, we're making jokes about it, and then they get you on the line.
[01:38:36.650 --> 01:38:40.551]  And they say, actually, this is real.
[01:38:40.551 --> 01:38:44.292]  And then, oh, haha, the director converted to Satanism.
[01:38:44.292 --> 01:38:48.073]  Oh, I'm sure the director just converted.
[01:38:48.073 --> 01:38:55.736]  See, I didn't get a bird's eye view into garden variety Satanists that kill their dog out in the woods on PCP.
[01:38:55.736 --> 01:38:58.076]  I mean, I knew about those in the 80s.
[01:38:58.076 --> 01:38:59.517]  I knew who was directing it.
[01:38:59.517 --> 01:39:01.578]  And, of course, it's come out who was directing it.
[01:39:01.578 --> 01:39:06.019]  You know the beatniks and the hippies were all a CIA creation, and they were actually Satanists.
[01:39:07.196 --> 01:39:14.059]  They were actually going and doing the real sex orgies and the real events and the real things.
[01:39:14.059 --> 01:39:15.859]  And I'm gonna just stop right there.
[01:39:15.859 --> 01:39:25.223]  But these people would never get within a mile or never know about real Satanism or real Luciferianism.
[01:39:25.223 --> 01:39:26.964]  I have seen it.
[01:39:26.964 --> 01:39:27.684]  Now let's continue.
[01:39:29.335 --> 01:39:36.981]  What they're really doing is roping in all these people, sucking them in, like, this is how we freak out the Christians.
[01:39:36.981 --> 01:39:38.202]  This is how we do it.
[01:39:38.202 --> 01:39:40.424]  This is how we dress up in costumes.
[01:39:40.424 --> 01:39:42.465]  This is how we dress up as actors.
[01:39:42.465 --> 01:39:43.466]  We're actors.
[01:39:43.466 --> 01:39:45.087]  We're not really believing in Satanism.
[01:39:45.087 --> 01:39:51.392]  But then within 10 minutes they say, it's clear that an actor who isn't really a Satanist can't do this.
[01:39:51.392 --> 01:39:53.854]  I've been a Satanist since I was a child.
[01:39:53.854 --> 01:39:54.595]  I'll be the leader.
[01:39:56.070 --> 01:40:04.095]  And then they even break off like PETA is the friendly group, like the IRA is the bad group, and then Sinn Féin is the friendly group.
[01:40:04.095 --> 01:40:19.805]  Oh, the young woman breaks off to go run the radical, underground, Satanist terror group that's going to kill Trump, and everyone winks, winks, and oh, the average leftist wouldn't get the esoteric double and triple meanings of it all.
[01:40:19.805 --> 01:40:23.067]  It was a glorification of a bunch of demented, weak nerds.
[01:40:24.622 --> 01:40:37.411]  Who have made no real sacrifices in their lives and who are trying to find Satan to give them power from the world system to try to raise money off other nerds who want some operating system.
[01:40:37.411 --> 01:40:45.897]  But what it is, is the fact that the Democratic Party in the last 10 years has gone completely Satanism as their operating system.
[01:40:46.638 --> 01:40:52.583]  And if you go to any of their events or any of their operations, this isn't people rebelling listening to Motley Crue in the 80s.
[01:40:52.583 --> 01:40:58.288]  This isn't, you know, people getting off on high energy and rebellion.
[01:40:58.288 --> 01:41:01.731]  Just normal human things God gave us as an aspect of who we are.
[01:41:01.731 --> 01:41:04.634]  That's God giving us that.
[01:41:04.634 --> 01:41:14.122]  These are people who are having all of their energy siphoned off because they believe they're going to get some big Faustian dividend of power if they do it, but they're not.
[01:41:15.731 --> 01:41:26.227]  And again, you say, why would they put out the old Satanism model, the sexy, beautiful, voluptuous woman, to lure in businessmen and powerful people, and to really, that's real Satanism.
[01:41:27.978 --> 01:41:29.279]  Cults.
[01:41:29.279 --> 01:41:47.370]  This is meant to be stunted, dead-eyed, super weak, and shown as powerful because they've already gotten the giant masses of leftists to be soulless and have no connection to God, and so they'll never know what hit them when the devil tells you at the start, we don't believe in the devil, we don't believe in God.
[01:41:47.370 --> 01:41:49.532]  Get rid of that actor, I do believe in devil, I'm God.
[01:41:50.871 --> 01:42:02.887]  And then they show you all of this different vile iconography from real Satanism and real events and real things that go on where people try to shed themselves of their
[01:42:04.642 --> 01:42:16.107]  Elemental connection to God with these governors God put in us to not want to kill a young baby or not want to kill an innocent person or not want to do horrible things with an innocent person.
[01:42:16.107 --> 01:42:26.031]  You do this to have God damn you and God push you away and turn you over to a reprobate mind and give you over to great delusion so you can now be a vessel.
[01:42:27.341 --> 01:42:31.823]  And I look at the people in this film, and you can see, they're gone.
[01:42:31.823 --> 01:42:33.664]  There's no one left there.
[01:42:33.664 --> 01:42:35.644]  Lowest of the low.
[01:42:35.644 --> 01:42:37.445]  Lowest level.
[01:42:37.445 --> 01:42:41.767]  And this is who they will march out against you in the public schools.
[01:42:41.767 --> 01:42:43.407]  You think, drag queen story time?
[01:42:43.407 --> 01:42:45.128]  Remember the same people's bed?
[01:42:45.128 --> 01:42:53.452]  They are having Satanism clubs with your children, with them sitting on their laps right now, and that's what the Baphomet statue with the children is all about.
[01:42:53.452 --> 01:42:57.013]  Baphomet, destroying the next generation, and it's a celebration of the death of children.
[01:43:06.604 --> 01:43:15.608]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[01:43:15.608 --> 01:43:25.691]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[01:43:25.691 --> 01:43:34.215]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[01:43:35.055 --> 01:43:36.396]  There's nothing else like it.
[01:43:36.396 --> 01:43:37.556]  You must experience it.
[01:43:37.556 --> 01:43:39.497]  It is a total game changer.
[01:43:39.497 --> 01:43:44.559]  And it comes in easy to use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[01:43:44.559 --> 01:43:46.079]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[01:43:46.079 --> 01:43:47.560]  It lasts 10 hours.
[01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:54.242]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[01:43:54.242 --> 01:43:55.723]  TurboForce at m4slive.com
[01:43:57.202 --> 01:44:02.425]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[01:44:02.425 --> 01:44:10.989]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[01:44:10.989 --> 01:44:13.971]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[01:44:13.971 --> 01:44:15.712]  How can I solve that problem?
[01:44:15.712 --> 01:44:21.975]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[01:44:24.076 --> 01:44:29.398]  The Alexa Pure Breeze Groundbreaking Ion Cluster Air Filter Technology.
[01:44:29.398 --> 01:44:32.340]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[01:44:32.340 --> 01:44:36.281]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[01:44:36.281 --> 01:44:40.263]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[01:44:40.263 --> 01:44:42.084]  I've got two in my home.
[01:44:42.084 --> 01:44:48.166]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[01:44:48.166 --> 01:44:49.007]  Don't live
[01:44:49.847 --> 01:44:53.909]  In a polluted major city, in your home, have clean air.
[01:44:53.909 --> 01:44:58.512]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:44:58.512 --> 01:45:02.474]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:45:02.474 --> 01:45:05.756]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[01:45:05.756 --> 01:45:12.019]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater, and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:45:12.019 --> 01:45:14.801]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[01:45:15.521 --> 01:45:19.342]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[01:45:19.342 --> 01:45:25.804]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[01:45:25.804 --> 01:45:30.766]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:45:31.536 --> 01:45:35.458]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[01:45:35.458 --> 01:45:42.660]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:45:42.660 --> 01:45:47.322]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:45:47.322 --> 01:45:53.565]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:45:53.565 --> 01:45:57.546]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:45:57.546 --> 01:46:01.388]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from InfoWars
[01:46:03.187 --> 01:46:09.772]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[01:46:09.772 --> 01:46:18.479]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[01:46:18.479 --> 01:46:23.083]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[01:46:23.083 --> 01:46:24.544]  You are the info war.
[01:46:24.544 --> 01:46:28.067]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[01:46:28.747 --> 01:46:40.109]  Let everyone go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[01:46:40.109 --> 01:46:48.090]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[01:46:48.090 --> 01:46:55.132]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:46:55.132 --> 01:46:57.872]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning!
[01:47:01.326 --> 01:47:06.568]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:06.568 --> 01:47:10.650]  Imagine!
[01:47:26.423 --> 01:47:28.365]  America 2019.
[01:47:28.365 --> 01:47:30.667]  Theaters all over the country.
[01:47:30.667 --> 01:47:31.848]  Mainline theaters.
[01:47:31.848 --> 01:47:33.849]  The Alamo Draft House there in Austin.
[01:47:33.849 --> 01:47:34.290]  Banned.
[01:47:34.290 --> 01:47:35.050]  Pro-life.
[01:47:35.050 --> 01:47:37.052]  Unplanned film.
[01:47:37.052 --> 01:47:41.776]  Still scored number five in the box office, but they helped suppress it and get it out of most theaters.
[01:47:41.776 --> 01:47:42.757]  That just came out a few months ago.
[01:47:43.885 --> 01:47:49.950]  But the movie hails Satan, a masterpiece of being boring and stupid and predictable.
[01:47:49.950 --> 01:48:04.243]  But that's meant to lure in the pseudo-intellectual to believe they'll be avant-garde if they join what is a real entry-level meth-head type system.
[01:48:04.243 --> 01:48:05.604]  This is trailer park Satanism.
[01:48:06.653 --> 01:48:15.056]  With a bunch of pseudo-intellectuals, wearing their Antifa shirts, saying they're free speech, but viciously going after everybody else's free speech.
[01:48:15.056 --> 01:48:17.676]  So I went and saw Hill Satan.
[01:48:17.676 --> 01:48:23.358]  And, again, they say, you know, we hate babies, we dress up like babies and talk about killing them, we want to get rid of babies.
[01:48:23.358 --> 01:48:29.620]  I mean, it's just classic attack the innocent, attack the babies, attack the youth, attack the future.
[01:48:30.831 --> 01:48:36.993]  And if you type in Hail Satan into Google and click News, every article is positive with the same headlines.
[01:48:36.993 --> 01:48:39.713]  Turns out Satanists are the heroes and Christians are the bad people.
[01:48:39.713 --> 01:48:44.535]  Turns out Hail Satan is spreading Satanism across the world and everyone's joining us.
[01:48:44.535 --> 01:48:45.675]  It's the biggest thing ever.
[01:48:45.675 --> 01:48:55.718]  It's the Democratic Party in Hollywood attempting to launch a giant rollout of Satanism as if they're the good guys and they're the wonderful people.
[01:49:00.951 --> 01:49:05.233]  Shows the devil worshippers as good people, shows them with glowing reviews.
[01:49:05.233 --> 01:49:06.973]  Again, why is that important?
[01:49:06.973 --> 01:49:10.535]  They have their free speech to say that, but it's not free speech.
[01:49:10.535 --> 01:49:11.435]  They have a right.
[01:49:11.435 --> 01:49:13.596]  It's all the same talking points.
[01:49:13.596 --> 01:49:18.838]  This morning I looked at like 50 articles, I read four or five, and it was all the same.
[01:49:18.838 --> 01:49:19.838]  Three or four different headlines.
[01:49:19.838 --> 01:49:23.920]  Either, turns out you learn the bad guys are Christians, not the Satanists.
[01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:27.021]  Turns out that this is spreading across the world, it'll be the new religion.
[01:49:28.274 --> 01:49:33.297]  Turns out the left, you know, has become religious and are satanists, and it's all again tongue-in-cheek.
[01:49:33.297 --> 01:49:41.443]  Oh, there was the big freakout of the 1980s about the satanism invasion, and Geraldo Rivera and all of it.
[01:49:41.443 --> 01:49:46.526]  Ladies and gentlemen, I was living during that period in one of the wealthiest areas of the country.
[01:49:46.526 --> 01:49:50.509]  And wherever you get around wealth, you find satanism.
[01:49:50.509 --> 01:49:52.711]  And the satanists I knew had private jets and helicopters.
[01:49:53.982 --> 01:49:55.023]  And Mark Dice had it happen.
[01:49:55.023 --> 01:49:59.645]  They were offering him a national TV show with a member of Motley Crue.
[01:49:59.645 --> 01:50:00.926]  The Motley Crue guy wasn't like this.
[01:50:00.926 --> 01:50:02.847]  He's actually a pretty good guy.
[01:50:02.847 --> 01:50:11.252]  And the major director got Mark Dice in a meeting room and said, uh, you're a Christian, aren't you, Phil Dice?
[01:50:11.252 --> 01:50:11.612]  Full name.
[01:50:11.612 --> 01:50:12.032]  He goes, yeah.
[01:50:12.032 --> 01:50:13.954]  He goes, yeah.
[01:50:13.954 --> 01:50:23.159]  Well, we're gonna give you this national TV show and all this money, but we want you to renounce Jesus Christ and we want you to worship Lucifer.
[01:50:25.037 --> 01:50:25.837]  Mark says, is this a joke?
[01:50:25.837 --> 01:50:28.939]  The guy said, no, I want you to pray with me right now.
[01:50:28.939 --> 01:50:30.400]  And Mark said, are you just messing with me?
[01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:35.003]  And he goes, no, I'm serious.
[01:50:35.003 --> 01:50:37.964]  You understand that, folks?
[01:50:37.964 --> 01:50:41.026]  I have known some of the top Hollywood people out there.
[01:50:41.026 --> 01:50:43.447]  Most of them didn't ever want to come on the show.
[01:50:43.447 --> 01:50:46.729]  So the ones you know about that have identified with the show is the tip of the iceberg.
[01:50:46.729 --> 01:50:49.711]  They've told me, they said, Alex.
[01:50:49.711 --> 01:50:51.032]  They said, you're absolutely right.
[01:50:51.032 --> 01:50:51.432]  They said,
[01:50:53.436 --> 01:50:56.898]  About half of Hollywood are actual Satanists.
[01:50:56.898 --> 01:51:00.561]  And he said it's a way to manage people, a way to hurt people, a way to control people.
[01:51:00.561 --> 01:51:04.484]  And it's really bad.
[01:51:04.484 --> 01:51:11.488]  And folks, that's why I can tell you Satanism is real, it's big, and it's powerful.
[01:51:11.488 --> 01:51:13.770]  And, you know, I've told these stories.
[01:51:13.770 --> 01:51:16.632]  I'm not proud of them.
[01:51:16.632 --> 01:51:18.073]  But I was growing up in Dallas, Texas.
[01:51:19.836 --> 01:51:22.697]  And, uh, you know, I always look three or four years older than I was.
[01:51:22.697 --> 01:51:26.138]  There's pictures of me online folks have dug up and they go, look at Jones when he's 20.
[01:51:26.138 --> 01:51:29.698]  No, that's me at 15 in those photos.
[01:51:29.698 --> 01:51:32.279]  And I just thought, Hey, this is great.
[01:51:32.279 --> 01:51:40.581]  This college girl wants to have sex with me or this, this senior in high school beauty queen, you know, who lives out at the 20 bedroom mansion with a helicopter pad.
[01:51:40.581 --> 01:51:44.982]  Well, after you had sex with him a couple of times, you found out that that's not what this is really all about.
[01:51:46.181 --> 01:51:48.483]  And they wanted me bad.
[01:51:48.483 --> 01:51:49.864]  And again, there's an interdimensional thing.
[01:51:49.864 --> 01:51:51.225]  There's a spirit to this.
[01:51:51.225 --> 01:51:53.126]  Those folks didn't know it wasn't because I was good looking.
[01:51:53.126 --> 01:51:57.269]  And I wasn't the only one they were trying to recruit, but they wanted me the most.
[01:51:57.269 --> 01:52:00.312]  And that's because the enemy wants to get people while they're young.
[01:52:00.312 --> 01:52:03.774]  Why do you think the Bathomette statue shows the children beside Bathomette?
[01:52:03.774 --> 01:52:04.375]  This is real.
[01:52:05.461 --> 01:52:06.782]  The devil's real.
[01:52:06.782 --> 01:52:08.202]  Spirits are real.
[01:52:08.202 --> 01:52:14.505]  We only see a very narrow spectrum, but our mind tunes in to all the electromagnetics, all the different dimensions.
[01:52:14.505 --> 01:52:15.446]  It's all real.
[01:52:15.446 --> 01:52:16.726]  And the globalists know this.
[01:52:16.726 --> 01:52:32.594]  You know, I told Joe Rogan two years ago, and then again two months ago, I said major universities, and I listed them, have basically what are like astronaut interdimensional programs where they give people via IVs even stronger drugs
[01:52:33.871 --> 01:52:42.037]  that ayahuasca and DMT to keep them in the state and they're mapping these other dimensions and are having meetings with aliens.
[01:52:42.037 --> 01:52:45.400]  Now, this is what I know, okay?
[01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:47.101]  And I can't get into all the sources and all the things.
[01:52:47.101 --> 01:52:47.902]  I've told some of it.
[01:52:48.624 --> 01:52:53.927]  Okay, but let me just say, for whatever reason, it's kind of like Cat's Eye, that movie where the cat keeps seeing things throughout its life.
[01:52:53.927 --> 01:52:56.568]  I mean, I've just run into all these things throughout my life.
[01:52:56.568 --> 01:53:16.357]  And I remember hearing these things, and then notice he got on a professor and others a few weeks ago, and they were announcing news articles about major universities are now gonna have IV drip DMT, you're gonna stay in it for hours, and you're gonna map the other dimension, and they have whole bays of people, up to 50 people usually is the largest group, and they all go and have the same experiences.
[01:53:16.357 --> 01:53:17.358]  So they get on the drugs,
[01:53:17.978 --> 01:53:24.099]  And then all of a sudden, once they've done it enough and made contact, like a holodeck, the aliens show up.
[01:53:24.099 --> 01:53:25.459]  They're there, and they got little horns.
[01:53:25.459 --> 01:53:25.820]  They're friendly.
[01:53:25.820 --> 01:53:27.380]  They got little horns, though.
[01:53:27.380 --> 01:53:34.941]  And they just... People say it's like they're out to get us, but they tell us stuff, and we learn things, and they give us ideas.
[01:53:34.941 --> 01:53:36.602]  That's where Silicon Valley came from.
[01:53:36.602 --> 01:53:40.002]  That's where it all came from, just like God said.
[01:53:40.002 --> 01:53:43.483]  The devil is a fallen, ancient entity imprisoned on this planet.
[01:53:45.009 --> 01:53:49.652]  And it's testing us, and God allows that to happen, because we have free will.
[01:53:49.652 --> 01:53:53.974]  And the devil knows about a lot of ancient technology that God has built before.
[01:53:53.974 --> 01:53:55.195]  We're made in the image of God.
[01:53:55.195 --> 01:53:57.936]  And so the devil doesn't really know how to do it all.
[01:53:57.936 --> 01:54:02.879]  The devil comes to us and tells us what's been done before.
[01:54:02.879 --> 01:54:04.600]  You're getting the big, deep stuff here, folks.
[01:54:05.615 --> 01:54:11.659]  And so, again, these are fallen, failed entities that want to see something superior in God's image destroyed.
[01:54:11.659 --> 01:54:21.045]  That's why these poor fools go, I cut myself, I'm totally white, you know, my hair's falling out, I debase myself, I debase others to get closer to my God.
[01:54:21.045 --> 01:54:23.707]  Your God's not a God, it's killing you.
[01:54:23.707 --> 01:54:32.733]  The real God gave you the planet, your children, sex, enjoyment, food, fighting, loving, dancing, building.
[01:54:32.733 --> 01:54:34.734]  We are superior to Satan.
[01:54:35.959 --> 01:54:37.760]  Satan's just old.
[01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:39.620]  We're babies.
[01:54:39.620 --> 01:54:47.023]  So you could have Mike Tyson when he's three years old, and have some little, you know, 80-pound soul molester trip him up and beat him up.
[01:54:47.023 --> 01:54:50.144]  But that devil worshiper is not going to be able to beat up Mike Tyson when he's 22.
[01:54:50.144 --> 01:54:53.606]  You understand the difference here?
[01:54:53.606 --> 01:55:02.729]  So, the devil worshippers are real, and they want your soul, and they are absolutely running Silicon Valley, and they're pissed that I know it, and they're pissed it's come out.
[01:55:04.019 --> 01:55:08.304]  But I'm telling you folks, this is real.
[01:55:08.304 --> 01:55:12.069]  Now, again, the ones in black that look totally like zombies, they've been sucked.
[01:55:14.380 --> 01:55:15.761]  The higher level ones don't look like that.
[01:55:15.761 --> 01:55:16.481]  They got tans.
[01:55:16.481 --> 01:55:16.901]  They're hanging out.
[01:55:16.901 --> 01:55:18.042]  They're having a great time.
[01:55:18.042 --> 01:55:19.063]  You understand?
[01:55:19.063 --> 01:55:21.144]  It's only the ones that think you look like a vampire.
[01:55:21.144 --> 01:55:21.824]  You're all shriveled.
[01:55:21.824 --> 01:55:22.645]  You're like, ugh.
[01:55:22.645 --> 01:55:23.405]  That's when you're powerful.
[01:55:23.405 --> 01:55:31.850]  No, those are people that have had their souls turned over to this and total dominion to be sucked dry.
[01:55:31.850 --> 01:55:37.493]  And then they just go around ravenously trying to find innocence to bring back to their masters.
[01:55:37.493 --> 01:55:38.514]  They are the Renfields.
[01:55:40.526 --> 01:55:57.991]  So you look at them and you laugh at them, and so all the sucked liberals that are desperate and alone and scared, like Facebook admits to trying to keep them, and all by themselves, they see a movie glorifying little chicken-necked, weird-diseased, hunchbacked, meth-head looking people, and they think, well...
[01:56:01.457 --> 01:56:03.139]  I'm gonna be powerful now!
[01:56:03.139 --> 01:56:07.082]  They show them the weak race, and they go, this is when you're powerful.
[01:56:07.082 --> 01:56:10.405]  When you've been totally sucked dry, you'll be powerful.
[01:56:10.405 --> 01:56:13.607]  Yes, I'll be powerful once I've been totally sucked dry.
[01:56:13.607 --> 01:56:19.492]  Understand?
[01:56:19.492 --> 01:56:21.814]  But it's all a deception.
[01:56:21.814 --> 01:56:23.496]  All a deception.
[01:56:23.496 --> 01:56:24.216]  All a deception.
[01:56:24.216 --> 01:56:24.737]  We're gonna go to break.
[01:56:25.720 --> 01:56:28.803]  Come back and I'm going to finish up with this and I'm going to get into the big news.
[01:56:28.803 --> 01:56:30.184]  It's crazy, I wish we could get to it.
[01:56:30.184 --> 01:56:33.027]  Briefly, haven't plugged the sour, need to plug.
[01:56:33.027 --> 01:56:36.791]  God gave us things like Methylcobalamin, the highest quality B12.
[01:56:36.791 --> 01:56:40.894]  And it's only in mushrooms and it's only in like whale fat, in high levels.
[01:56:40.894 --> 01:56:43.076]  And most people can't absorb it, especially northern Europeans.
[01:56:44.042 --> 01:56:47.124]  But if you take our new product, Better Than Secret 12, it's the same thing.
[01:56:47.124 --> 01:56:47.825]  Methylcobalamin.
[01:56:47.825 --> 01:56:48.785]  Twice as strong.
[01:56:48.785 --> 01:56:50.346]  I signed a multi-year contract.
[01:56:50.346 --> 01:56:51.307]  Got a great deal on it.
[01:56:51.307 --> 01:56:53.048]  It's now twice as strong.
[01:56:53.048 --> 01:56:55.290]  The strongest B12 we even know of out there.
[01:56:55.290 --> 01:56:56.971]  Pure highest quality.
[01:56:56.971 --> 01:56:58.672]  Methylcobalamin is the best.
[01:56:58.672 --> 01:57:00.573]  Not just highest quality B12 of some type.
[01:57:00.573 --> 01:57:03.235]  It's the best of that type of the best.
[01:57:03.235 --> 01:57:03.855]  Ultra 12.
[01:57:03.855 --> 01:57:04.596]  No reviews yet.
[01:57:04.596 --> 01:57:05.616]  Go look at Secret 12.
[01:57:05.616 --> 01:57:07.097]  Thousands of five-star reviews.
[01:57:07.097 --> 01:57:08.178]  Ultra 12.
[01:57:08.178 --> 01:57:09.579]  Twice as strong.
[01:57:09.579 --> 01:57:10.660]  Out of the gates.
[01:57:10.660 --> 01:57:12.141]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:57:12.141 --> 01:57:12.961]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:57:12.961 --> 01:57:13.602]  Take it under the tongue.
[01:57:14.683 --> 01:57:17.005]  When the caffeine don't work no more, that just stimulates the brain.
[01:57:17.005 --> 01:57:20.108]  This is what empowers the whole body in a healthy way.
[01:57:20.108 --> 01:57:23.452]  Get the X2 and get a free bottle of X3 as well.
[01:57:23.452 --> 01:57:25.174]  That special's about to end.

[01:57:28.958 --> 01:57:30.319]  Everything we do is a win-win.
[01:57:30.319 --> 01:57:31.601]  Everything we do is a 360 win.
[01:57:31.601 --> 01:57:32.962]  Everything we do is symbiotic.
[01:57:32.962 --> 01:57:34.864]  Everything we do is positive towards life.
[01:57:35.945 --> 01:57:40.350]  Just like we sell water filters you need that are the best rated out there at the lowest price.
[01:57:40.350 --> 01:57:43.373]  You fund the info to help others while you get something helps you.
[01:57:43.373 --> 01:57:44.534]  That's God's plan.
[01:57:44.534 --> 01:57:44.974]  Stay with us.
[01:57:47.250 --> 01:57:57.860]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:57:57.860 --> 01:57:59.922]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[01:57:59.922 --> 01:58:02.784]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:58:02.784 --> 01:58:04.266]  It's made in the USA.
[01:58:04.266 --> 01:58:11.112]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[01:58:11.112 --> 01:58:12.333]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[01:58:13.174 --> 01:58:22.882]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[01:58:22.882 --> 01:58:39.695]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:58:39.695 --> 01:58:42.858]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[01:58:42.978 --> 01:58:45.379]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield.
[01:58:45.379 --> 01:58:48.920]  Infowarslife.com.

[01:59:50.829 --> 01:59:53.471]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:06.941 --> 02:00:13.207]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:39.230 --> 02:00:47.635]  You don't have to hear it from me that there's been a giant satanic invasion launched upon humanity.
[02:00:47.635 --> 02:00:48.496]  It's been brewing.
[02:00:48.496 --> 02:00:49.977]  It's been building.
[02:00:49.977 --> 02:00:50.817]  Attack families.
[02:00:50.817 --> 02:00:52.639]  Attack Christianity.
[02:00:52.639 --> 02:00:54.700]  Say you can't say mother and father.
[02:00:54.700 --> 02:00:56.321]  Kill babies after they're born.
[02:00:56.321 --> 02:00:59.363]  Send in convicted pedophiles all over the Western world.
[02:00:59.363 --> 02:01:01.925]  Unannounced schools to have your children sit on their laps.
[02:01:02.745 --> 02:01:04.466]  This is pure evil.
[02:01:04.466 --> 02:01:12.052]  Hollywood is there to destroy your soul, destroy your mind, to debilitate you, to demoralize you.
[02:01:12.052 --> 02:01:25.962]  I sent one of our operatives into Sundance Film Festival, and in these meetings this year, they admitted, we are here to demoralize, we are here to pull things down, we are here to depress, we are here to destroy.
[02:01:25.962 --> 02:01:28.544]  And that's what's being funded.
[02:01:28.544 --> 02:01:29.565]  And that's the plan.
[02:01:29.565 --> 02:01:32.107]  And films like Hail Satan are
[02:01:34.082 --> 02:01:39.804]  Couched as jokes, but in all the press it heralds the new satanic invasion.
[02:01:39.804 --> 02:01:56.568]  So they tell you there wasn't a satanic invasion in the 80s, which there was, but now we are taking over and we're going to overturn Christianity for free speech when the left is all anti-free speech and this very satanic group is anti-Alex Jones and doesn't think I should be on the air.
[02:01:56.568 --> 02:02:00.650]  It's all happening at the same time.
[02:02:00.650 --> 02:02:01.810]  So films like Hell, Satan,
[02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:08.284]  Herald the big coming out of the Satanist.
[02:02:08.284 --> 02:02:13.428]  And now you see the coming out of the pedophiles and the coming out in college textbooks saying fetuses are cancer.
[02:02:13.428 --> 02:02:14.049]  Get rid of them.
[02:02:14.049 --> 02:02:15.310]  Fetuses are bad.
[02:02:15.310 --> 02:02:17.772]  Stop venerating babies.
[02:02:17.772 --> 02:02:22.396]  Women are empowered when they kill their babies.
[02:02:22.396 --> 02:02:24.157]  This is real selfishness.
[02:02:24.157 --> 02:02:28.721]  This is real Satanism being brought to you by the most soul-sucked
[02:02:29.770 --> 02:02:33.251]  Minions of the system you could ever imagine.
[02:02:33.251 --> 02:02:47.275]  Because again, those of us that are strong, those of us that have will, look at people like that and say, I would never want to be involved with a group of people that look like they're diseased and are about to die.
[02:02:47.275 --> 02:02:51.636]  Being in a movie theater with them, I could feel the weakness.
[02:02:51.636 --> 02:02:53.157]  I could feel the enslavement.
[02:02:53.157 --> 02:02:56.398]  It was like Los Angeles had landed in Austin.
[02:02:56.398 --> 02:02:57.658]  And they are invading here.
[02:02:59.790 --> 02:03:08.553]  The Ringwraiths, the soulless zombies, the archetype looking for the soul, the brain to eat, so they can be human again.
[02:03:08.553 --> 02:03:27.520]  It's all couched in pseudo-intellectualism, delivered to you by diseased-looking, crazed, ugly people, who want to be ugly, because they are ugly, and they've embraced it, and they're going to bring it to you, and they're going to make you eat of it, and they're going to make you absorb it, and they're going to conquer you.
[02:03:28.795 --> 02:03:30.155]  And they're coming.
[02:03:30.155 --> 02:03:33.736]  And they're here.
[02:03:33.736 --> 02:03:36.717]  And they revel in your destruction.
[02:03:36.717 --> 02:03:39.298]  They revel in their hate of God.
[02:03:39.298 --> 02:03:45.520]  They revel in their hate of men and women and that beautiful, powerful union.
[02:03:45.520 --> 02:03:52.822]  So the devil worshippers aren't setting it up with, oh, be a white witch and have fun and help people and empower.
[02:03:52.822 --> 02:03:54.802]  That hasn't worked for them.
[02:03:54.802 --> 02:03:57.483]  So now they go right to the deception.
[02:03:58.601 --> 02:04:00.902]  And say, Satan is the empowerer.
[02:04:00.902 --> 02:04:02.783]  Satan is the one that will give you power.
[02:04:02.783 --> 02:04:04.764]  Satan is the one that will protect you.
[02:04:04.764 --> 02:04:09.427]  And you're looking at deranged slaves.
[02:04:09.427 --> 02:04:14.469]  But remember, if you go to a Democratic Party event, the people look dazed.
[02:04:14.469 --> 02:04:15.310]  They look scared.
[02:04:15.310 --> 02:04:16.530]  They look soulless.
[02:04:16.530 --> 02:04:18.251]  They look like they're lost.
[02:04:18.251 --> 02:04:20.593]  And that's the high end.
[02:04:20.593 --> 02:04:26.696]  Half of them, or the low side, are crazed and screaming and shaking with hatred.
[02:04:28.195 --> 02:04:40.600]  And they believe that those of you who have the light of God in your eyes are the enemy, and if they could simply extinguish that light, then they could finally have power.
[02:04:40.600 --> 02:04:45.262]  In their search for power, they have found the opposite of power.
[02:04:45.262 --> 02:04:47.543]  They found the dead space.
[02:04:47.543 --> 02:04:49.183]  The Phantom Zone.
[02:04:49.183 --> 02:04:53.505]  And now their only wish is to take us with them.
[02:04:53.505 --> 02:04:55.846]  The tentacle reaches out, grabs them, they grab for us.
[02:04:56.533 --> 02:05:09.938]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship, and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[02:05:09.938 --> 02:05:20.982]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night, all the arrogant leftist authoritarians, like the Young Turks and others, get so butthurt when Trump won.
[02:05:22.296 --> 02:05:24.223]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[02:05:24.223 --> 02:05:26.912]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[02:05:28.302 --> 02:05:32.603]  And that's why the globalists, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[02:05:32.603 --> 02:05:39.125]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech, about taking your very sovereignty away.
[02:05:39.125 --> 02:05:41.445]  This country is in a war!
[02:05:41.445 --> 02:05:52.148]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[02:05:52.148 --> 02:05:55.729]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands, InfoWarsStore.com, thank you!
[02:06:13.135 --> 02:06:15.256]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:15.256 --> 02:06:17.917]  Because there is a war on.
[02:06:17.917 --> 02:06:29.742]  Or your mind.
[02:06:29.742 --> 02:06:30.802]  I want them shut down.
[02:06:30.802 --> 02:06:31.743]  I want them silenced.
[02:06:31.743 --> 02:06:32.583]  I want them muted.
[02:06:32.583 --> 02:06:34.804]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[02:06:34.804 --> 02:06:35.785]  Banning people.
[02:06:35.785 --> 02:06:40.887]  They're dictating the opinions that everyone on the platform is allowed to have.
[02:06:44.747 --> 02:06:51.951]  I'm a conservative Jew, so I guess that makes me such a dangerous person.
[02:06:51.951 --> 02:06:54.152]  Spreading articles, spreading videos, spreading links.
[02:06:54.152 --> 02:06:54.972]  You're going to get demonized.
[02:06:54.972 --> 02:06:59.235]  You're going to get attacked.
[02:06:59.235 --> 02:07:02.516]  It's going to do something terrible like help Trump get re-elected.
[02:07:02.516 --> 02:07:06.178]  That's really what all this is about.
[02:07:06.178 --> 02:07:10.921]  ...said that they deem our content and our brand unsustainable.
[02:07:13.643 --> 02:07:17.005]  It is the right to be, do, and say whatever you want.
[02:07:17.005 --> 02:07:19.427]  It's about freedom of expression.
[02:07:19.427 --> 02:07:21.628]  I'm a journalist.
[02:07:21.628 --> 02:07:28.053]  I'm a left not interested in telling the truth about me because I don't fit the stereotype.
[02:07:28.053 --> 02:07:31.475]  They can say whatever they think and I respect their constitutional right to do it.
[02:07:31.475 --> 02:07:33.176]  I hope they respect my constitution.
[02:07:48.194 --> 02:07:56.380]  You're next.
[02:07:56.380 --> 02:08:00.684]  They're keeping babies alive after they're born and harvesting their organs.
[02:08:00.684 --> 02:08:02.585]  I first told you that ten years ago.
[02:08:02.585 --> 02:08:05.087]  I gave specifics.
[02:08:05.087 --> 02:08:06.088]  I named the hospitals.
[02:08:07.475 --> 02:08:12.118]  Since then, there's been criminal convictions, indictments and lawsuits.
[02:08:12.118 --> 02:08:19.682]  Now five states in the last six months have passed laws to keep babies alive indefinitely and harvest their organs.
[02:08:19.682 --> 02:08:24.244]  No, this isn't some imaginary carpenter Halloween movie.
[02:08:24.244 --> 02:08:26.505]  This is the real world.
[02:08:26.505 --> 02:08:30.868]  Because the devil's greatest trick was convincing the world he didn't exist.
[02:08:30.868 --> 02:08:32.609]  I'm not trying to cliffhanger people.
[02:08:32.609 --> 02:08:34.890]  I always get about ten minutes behind on a broadcast.
[02:08:36.153 --> 02:08:38.234]  And I have Dan Lyman joining me in the next segment.
[02:08:38.234 --> 02:08:40.196]  He'll be on for a couple segments.
[02:08:40.196 --> 02:08:44.678]  And I said at the start of this hour, I would cover this big story.
[02:08:44.678 --> 02:08:48.841]  But because I heard that little two-minute piece, I've got some other news I want to hit.
[02:08:48.841 --> 02:08:52.423]  I'm going to do it in the last segment of this hour, but I will get to it.
[02:08:52.423 --> 02:08:58.127]  And you know, I don't do this on purpose, but it is good to build something up.
[02:08:58.127 --> 02:09:01.149]  This is so big.
[02:09:01.149 --> 02:09:03.190]  I was told this a couple years ago.
[02:09:03.190 --> 02:09:04.531]  I was told this again last year.
[02:09:05.771 --> 02:09:14.453]  I was told this again this year, and I got documents confirming it that I'm not allowed to obviously show you.
[02:09:14.453 --> 02:09:21.855]  Sometimes when I get documents, I'm given them, but I'm told I can't show them.
[02:09:21.855 --> 02:09:23.695]  But this is really incredible.
[02:09:30.854 --> 02:09:40.696]  The reason I'm going to hold off is I got busy during those segments and didn't print some of these other articles that I want to have go with this, because there's also some mainstream news where this has been admitted.
[02:09:40.696 --> 02:09:55.578]  Like you've seen the headlines, Silicon Valley moderators, groups that fight hate, the Southern Poverty Law Center people, like 70,000 of them trained total now, 20,000 at Facebook alone, 30,000, well there's 20,000 at Google, 10,000 at YouTube.
[02:09:59.633 --> 02:10:02.254]  And they're expanding in these quote, human rights boards.
[02:10:02.254 --> 02:10:04.095]  They're even gonna be in MasterCards announcing it.
[02:10:04.095 --> 02:10:10.937]  I mean, just everywhere you go, they'll be there to say, you don't get food, you don't come in Costco, you don't get a bank account.
[02:10:10.937 --> 02:10:13.918]  And then if you give in to them, what will that be like?
[02:10:13.918 --> 02:10:14.899]  Just always more, more, more.
[02:10:14.899 --> 02:10:17.440]  I mean, this is flaming authoritarianism.
[02:10:17.440 --> 02:10:21.881]  This is global corporate government taking over.
[02:10:21.881 --> 02:10:24.242]  That's what the New World Order is.
[02:10:24.242 --> 02:10:25.603]  It's illegal.
[02:10:25.603 --> 02:10:26.083]  It's criminal.
[02:10:26.083 --> 02:10:26.583]  It's dangerous.
[02:10:27.915 --> 02:10:35.239]  And sure, if you want to argue it isn't illegal, which it is, oh, it's a private company, then change the damn law because it's dangerous!
[02:10:35.239 --> 02:10:42.762]  You know, back in the days of... Teddy Roosevelt was a pretty good president.
[02:10:42.762 --> 02:10:54.528]  He said, the railroads won't let their competition pay to ship their own fruit or their own cattle when there's room.
[02:10:54.528 --> 02:10:55.248]  That's a monopoly.
[02:10:55.248 --> 02:10:56.469]  We're going to break that up, he told
[02:10:57.975 --> 02:11:04.358]  Northern Pacific and all of them, you're gonna ship people's products.
[02:11:04.358 --> 02:11:07.580]  Or I'm gonna have your ass arrested.
[02:11:07.580 --> 02:11:09.361]  That's a private business!
[02:11:09.361 --> 02:11:10.901]  They can do whatever they want!
[02:11:10.901 --> 02:11:18.605]  The big railroads advertise, they got open land, they got all the exemptions, they got liability protection to open up the West and have commerce.
[02:11:18.605 --> 02:11:26.289]  And then once they had the railroads coast to coast, they started saying, there's even like a gun smoke on it I saw once that's based on true stories where they want to ship the peaches.
[02:11:27.290 --> 02:11:28.951]  A thousand miles?
[02:11:28.951 --> 02:11:31.271]  And the kid's dad's died, I'm going from memory.
[02:11:31.271 --> 02:11:35.373]  The kid's dad's died, was it a gun smoker or was it a bonanza?
[02:11:35.373 --> 02:11:37.193]  But you read history books, that's all over the place.
[02:11:37.193 --> 02:11:42.655]  And then you know where they, Louis L'Amour and others, and you've got those ideas that are in those western books, they're fiction.
[02:11:42.655 --> 02:11:43.676]  None of that stuff's fiction.
[02:11:43.676 --> 02:11:46.757]  They've just gone and rewritten old newspaper articles, they went and found it at the library.
[02:11:51.755 --> 02:11:53.956]  Want to ship your peaches?
[02:11:53.956 --> 02:11:56.978]  That old Western, I think his dad had died, his mom had died.
[02:11:56.978 --> 02:12:02.881]  He wanted to keep the little farm and the big local corrupt guy wanted to take it because it had watering holes on it or whatever.
[02:12:02.881 --> 02:12:09.944]  And then he goes to the railroad and makes a deal with them where they won't ship his peaches.
[02:12:09.944 --> 02:12:12.706]  A thousand miles so he can make the money to save his farm.
[02:12:14.292 --> 02:12:18.373]  But in the end, he loads them up in a wagon, takes him a month or so to get there.
[02:12:18.373 --> 02:12:21.674]  The guy sends bandits to stop him, but they get stopped.
[02:12:21.674 --> 02:12:27.955]  And then when he gets there, he thinks all the peaches are dead and rotten, but under the first layer, all the peaches are alive.
[02:12:27.955 --> 02:12:30.556]  Pretty good story.
[02:12:30.556 --> 02:12:33.036]  The peaches are still not bad.
[02:12:33.036 --> 02:12:35.597]  They're still ripening.
[02:12:35.597 --> 02:12:37.217]  And see, those are real stories, though.
[02:12:37.217 --> 02:12:40.838]  That isn't just gun smoke or bonanza that you're watching.
[02:12:43.516 --> 02:12:46.217]  That isn't just Gunsmoker Bonanza that you're sitting there looking at.
[02:12:46.217 --> 02:12:48.437]  This is the real world, folks.
[02:12:48.437 --> 02:12:57.999]  We're CNN, and I'll go back to this, not because I don't have 150 articles or more and 30 or 40 incredible video clips to play you, and a guest waiting in the wings.
[02:12:57.999 --> 02:13:08.181]  CNN went on last weekend and said, we want Alex Jones to not be able to use his telephone.
[02:13:08.181 --> 02:13:13.042]  Then they had a New York Post headline, should Alex Jones be able to use the telephone?
[02:13:15.814 --> 02:13:24.805]  You see, because once you say in a big telecommunications system, people can't say somebody's name on their website, it's the sky's the limit.
[02:13:24.805 --> 02:13:30.872]  And of course, big tech wants to tell you where you can go and what you can do and what you can say.
[02:13:30.872 --> 02:13:34.897]  And where's our Teddy Roosevelt?
[02:13:34.897 --> 02:13:35.258]  To say,
[02:13:36.866 --> 02:13:41.889]  You've made billions of dollars, back at that time trillions, in today's numbers.
[02:13:41.889 --> 02:14:03.004]  You've got more money than God, more money than any royalty in the world, JPMorgan Chase, Northern Pacific, Union Pacific, Standard Oil, Rockefellers, and you won't ship building supplies to companies you don't like in San Francisco.
[02:14:05.307 --> 02:14:08.669]  You won't ship steam engines to people.
[02:14:08.669 --> 02:14:21.255]  You've got intelligence officers with guns, assassins, Pinkerton men, going around surveilling everybody that comes up trying to ship something and finding out, and then charging them two, three times if you let them ship it.
[02:14:21.255 --> 02:14:25.537]  That's not American, and you're not pulling that crap.
[02:14:25.537 --> 02:14:31.700]  This is an antitrust issue, and Trump needs to do something right now.
[02:14:31.700 --> 02:14:33.141]  And you need to do something right now.
[02:14:34.531 --> 02:14:39.653]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, so many people come to me and they say, Alex, I'm sorry you've gone through all this.
[02:14:39.653 --> 02:14:42.314]  How are you taking it?
[02:14:42.314 --> 02:14:43.274]  I'm a leader.
[02:14:43.274 --> 02:14:46.735]  I'm not bragging or anything, but I mean, I adapt and overcome.
[02:14:46.735 --> 02:14:49.316]  Combat model, optimum self-sufficiency.
[02:14:49.316 --> 02:14:50.977]  Just like other Americans.
[02:14:52.327 --> 02:14:56.389]  And I'm not going to sit here and worry about me.
[02:14:56.389 --> 02:14:58.429]  I'll do okay no matter what happens.
[02:14:58.429 --> 02:15:06.292]  But you think about everybody else with this control system, a bunch of followers, with a system that's going to totally control their life and tell them what they can say and what they can do.
[02:15:06.292 --> 02:15:12.575]  And then the end game of these people is horrible control and enslavement and dumbing down for social engineering.
[02:15:14.201 --> 02:15:19.145]  If you think people are dumb and evil and stupid now, you haven't seen anything yet!
[02:15:19.145 --> 02:15:32.716]  If you think devil worshippers all over the news saying we're gonna come to your school and talk to your kids whether you like it or not is bad, and we're gonna kill babies after they're born, if you think that's bad in 2019, Bubba, you ain't seen nothing yet!
[02:15:32.716 --> 02:15:38.221]  Because before the globalists can release the bioweapons, God has to remove his protection.
[02:15:41.314 --> 02:15:42.534]  No.
[02:15:42.534 --> 02:15:48.335]  The devil would nuke this planet in 10 seconds if God removed his protection.
[02:15:48.335 --> 02:15:50.456]  And God is gonna remove the protection.
[02:15:50.456 --> 02:15:52.836]  But for one hour.
[02:15:52.836 --> 02:15:55.256]  One hour, and we're gonna be ready before it happens.
[02:15:55.256 --> 02:15:57.937]  Everyone knows, even good people fall on hard times.
[02:15:57.937 --> 02:16:01.337]  Your credit cards get maxed out, and you get behind on your taxes.
[02:16:01.337 --> 02:16:05.998]  Unfortunately, the IRS is not as understanding, and they won't stop until they collect.
[02:16:05.998 --> 02:16:10.659]  They have the power to take your paycheck, freeze your bank accounts, even your home or business could be at risk.
[02:16:10.879 --> 02:16:14.221]  It's simply not worth it to take on the IRS by yourself.
[02:16:14.221 --> 02:16:16.803]  You need to call the experts at Optima Tax Relief.
[02:16:16.803 --> 02:16:19.525]  When you call, be sure to ask about the Fresh Start Initiative.

[02:16:55.265 --> 02:16:56.485]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:16:56.485 --> 02:17:00.406]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:17:00.406 --> 02:17:01.946]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:17:01.946 --> 02:17:04.907]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:17:04.907 --> 02:17:10.468]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:17:10.468 --> 02:17:11.668]  I can help you, too.
[02:17:11.668 --> 02:17:14.588]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[02:17:14.588 --> 02:17:16.809]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[02:17:16.809 --> 02:17:21.269]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com.

[02:17:24.830 --> 02:17:31.193]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[02:17:31.193 --> 02:17:34.215]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[02:17:34.215 --> 02:17:40.158]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:17:40.158 --> 02:17:43.940]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[02:17:43.940 --> 02:17:45.200]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:17:45.200 --> 02:17:46.541]  Who do we fight for?
[02:17:46.541 --> 02:17:52.744]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[02:17:52.744 --> 02:17:54.185]  Available at Amazon Books.
[02:17:56.587 --> 02:18:02.617]  Our grandparents and great-grandparents knew that they canned food during the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[02:18:02.617 --> 02:18:05.562]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFootwearStore.com.

[02:19:18.239 --> 02:19:22.323]  It's not very profitable because we give it at such a low price, but it's amazing.

[02:20:51.019 --> 02:20:54.461]  Dan Lyman joins us.
[02:20:54.461 --> 02:20:56.782]  Investigative journalist.
[02:20:56.782 --> 02:20:58.903]  Patriot.
[02:20:58.903 --> 02:21:01.765]  Heads up.
[02:21:01.765 --> 02:21:03.246]  Europe Wars dot com.
[02:21:03.246 --> 02:21:06.247]  Boy, there are a lot of articles at Europe Wars dot com that are exclusively there.
[02:21:06.247 --> 02:21:12.471]  Brussels busses suspend service to NoGo station, shouting malaria TB outbreak.
[02:21:13.402 --> 02:21:18.206]  So, malaria TB, that's really never been there, especially malaria, but now it's there.
[02:21:18.206 --> 02:21:21.129]  Just like all the diseases pouring over in the United States.
[02:21:21.129 --> 02:21:24.492]  In the Ellis Island days, they checked everybody for a few months at least.
[02:21:24.492 --> 02:21:25.493]  Not now, Dan Lyman.
[02:21:25.493 --> 02:21:28.315]  Thanks for joining us from Europe.
[02:21:28.315 --> 02:21:29.496]  Alex, how you doing?
[02:21:29.496 --> 02:21:30.157]  Good, man.
[02:21:30.157 --> 02:21:33.000]  Wow, you've got so much you've been covering the last few weeks that you've been on with us.
[02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.882]  People gotta check EuropeWars.com every day.
[02:21:35.882 --> 02:21:36.543]  Tell us what's happening.
[02:21:37.754 --> 02:21:39.254]  Yes, never a dull moment.
[02:21:39.254 --> 02:21:45.876]  As you were just mentioning, one of our latest stories is out of Brussels, but I think it ties into the larger situation here.
[02:21:45.876 --> 02:21:48.497]  So what we have is this station in Brussels.
[02:21:48.497 --> 02:21:51.138]  It's one of their busiest stations, the most important ones in the city.
[02:21:51.138 --> 02:21:58.560]  We've been covering the situation that's been going on there for about a year now at this point, because it's basically been turned into a de facto migrant camp.
[02:21:58.780 --> 02:21:59.160]  I think?
[02:22:18.070 --> 02:22:18.310]  I'm good.
[02:22:37.282 --> 02:22:45.770]  That the cleaning staff that work at this train station are now going to be vaccinated for a variety of different diseases, including a variety of hepatitis strains.
[02:22:45.770 --> 02:22:51.175]  And so they're also downplaying this one and saying, oh, you know, there's no there's nobody that's been infected.
[02:22:51.175 --> 02:22:53.316]  We're just doing this as a precautionary measure.
[02:22:53.316 --> 02:22:55.939]  But I think that this ties into the larger situation.
[02:22:55.939 --> 02:22:59.342]  We have this measles outbreak that's just exploding across the U.S.
[02:22:59.882 --> 02:23:05.126]  And of course, it's we, the people, the citizens of these countries that pay the price.
[02:23:29.415 --> 02:23:34.379]  I'll tell you, Dan, these are big biohazard sites.
[02:23:34.379 --> 02:23:47.290]  And the Border Patrol's come out and said, we've got drug-resistant tuberculosis, we've got scabies, we've got bubonic plague making a comeback, leprosy, we've got people we can't even check that's being let in, put on Democratic Party buses, and just shipped into God knows where.
[02:23:47.290 --> 02:23:52.414]  And when Trump says, fine, we'll ship them to only blue cities, Cory Booker and others said, no, no, don't do that, that's dangerous.
[02:23:54.029 --> 02:24:21.501]  Exactly, you know I have relatives, a lot of my relatives came from overseas and they immigrated to the United States and they all tell me about the procedure that they had to go through when they came and this wasn't even that long ago for some of them where you had to provide x-rays of your lungs in order to even kind of be checked out at all to check for tuberculosis and all of these measures seem to have just been thrown out the window for all these people who want to come here from the third world and there is no concern for what they might be bringing with them.
[02:24:23.786 --> 02:24:24.667]  The larger plan.
[02:24:24.667 --> 02:24:27.690]  I mean, the UN admits this is meant to bankrupt things.
[02:24:27.690 --> 02:24:29.492]  It's a cloward and pivot operation.
[02:24:29.492 --> 02:24:32.014]  On paper they say it's just replacement migration.
[02:24:32.014 --> 02:24:35.097]  With 80, 90% of people not getting jobs, staying on welfare.
[02:24:35.097 --> 02:24:36.639]  Giant no-go zones everywhere.
[02:24:36.639 --> 02:24:39.502]  What, just a few years ago, Dan, they denied the no-go zones.
[02:24:39.502 --> 02:24:41.364]  Tell folks that don't know what a no-go zone is.
[02:24:42.566 --> 02:24:44.407]  Yeah, I've been in them myself.
[02:24:44.407 --> 02:24:50.290]  I actually reported from one last year in Italy, just to give people an idea.
[02:24:50.290 --> 02:24:53.332]  I mean, you go into these areas, yes, technically you can go into them.
[02:24:53.332 --> 02:24:55.192]  You're not allowed to go into them.
[02:24:55.192 --> 02:25:05.057]  But you do risk anything from a robbery to your own life, depending on how bad the zone is and how fearful the police are of going in them.
[02:25:05.057 --> 02:25:06.518]  I've been in them in Paris.
[02:25:06.518 --> 02:25:09.220]  I've been in them in Hamburg, Germany.
[02:25:09.220 --> 02:25:09.780]  I've been in them
[02:25:10.280 --> 02:25:20.026]  In Italy last year during one of our reports, and these areas are basically areas where the police won't go, or they're afraid to go, or they're just afraid to enforce the law.
[02:25:20.026 --> 02:25:32.754]  And I would say that at this point there are areas of places like Portland, Oregon, which are also becoming lawless areas because of people like Antifa, who are just basically, they're running the show there.
[02:25:32.754 --> 02:25:38.358]  And if people want to, these things are going on in the United States as well, of course, in San Francisco, Los Angeles.
[02:25:38.778 --> 02:25:42.822]  I mean, it's just crazy that everywhere the left's in control, a literal nightmare ensues.
[02:25:42.822 --> 02:25:43.502]  What's their endgame?
[02:26:04.218 --> 02:26:04.959]  That's a good question.
[02:26:22.353 --> 02:26:22.834]  I think?
[02:26:38.534 --> 02:26:45.416]  Assaults, rapes, I mean, it depends on how bad the area that it is, but it's happening across Europe and the United States as well.
[02:26:45.416 --> 02:26:50.357]  And, of course, the officers are either ordered to stand down or they're just totally overwhelmed.
[02:26:50.357 --> 02:27:01.640]  And that's okay with the socialists who are in charge because it just makes it easier for them to take control of everything and to demand more money throughout the situation, which, of course, never really gets thrown at the situation.
[02:27:01.640 --> 02:27:03.440]  It goes into their pockets and their buddies.
[02:27:11.207 --> 02:27:15.689]  So yeah, I mean, this is just a situation that we're, you know, watching play out across Europe.
[02:27:15.689 --> 02:27:16.830]  It's incredible.
[02:27:16.830 --> 02:27:25.675]  I did spend a lot of time in the last couple of months here traveling in some lesser-known parts of Europe that aren't quite as affected by the globalist situation.
[02:27:25.675 --> 02:27:27.235]  These are not major cities.
[02:27:27.235 --> 02:27:28.136]  Some of them are islands.
[02:27:28.616 --> 02:27:29.217]  We're good to go.
[02:27:46.160 --> 02:27:54.002]  Back in the day before we had this migration wave and just rampant socialism that is sucking a lot of these cities dry.
[02:27:54.002 --> 02:28:01.064]  And of course, that's what's driving the protests in France now at this point and the bargaining protests that are happening across Europe for a variety of reasons.
[02:28:01.064 --> 02:28:02.285]  Well, let's talk about that.
[02:28:02.285 --> 02:28:07.546]  Thousands, over 1,200 churches burned in the last few years in Europe, 800 plus in France.
[02:28:07.546 --> 02:28:09.987]  That's the epicenter of the Islamic takeover.
[02:28:09.987 --> 02:28:11.047]  Celebration by Islam.
[02:28:11.047 --> 02:28:12.388]  As we come back, I want to get into
[02:28:13.408 --> 02:28:17.709]  The German president saying, let's just ban anybody that criticizes what we're doing.
[02:28:17.709 --> 02:28:19.450]  So now they're not even calling you Nazis or hateful.
[02:28:19.450 --> 02:28:24.132]  They're just saying, ban everybody, period.
[02:28:24.132 --> 02:28:25.192]  And this is their takeover.
[02:28:25.192 --> 02:28:26.452]  What is their endgame?
[02:28:26.452 --> 02:28:27.693]  What do they do?
[02:28:27.693 --> 02:28:34.175]  Well, it's just another 10, 20 million military-age Muslim men with no jobs who adopted a gangbanger culture.
[02:28:34.975 --> 02:28:38.217]  Burning cars every night, raping and killing people, running whores.
[02:28:38.217 --> 02:28:39.778]  What happens when everything just collapses?
[02:28:39.778 --> 02:28:42.520]  What is the endgame of the left?
[02:28:42.520 --> 02:28:45.221]  With Dan Lyman of EuropeWars.com.
[02:28:45.221 --> 02:28:46.122]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.

[02:29:01.894 --> 02:29:03.636]  I had a problem like you once.
[02:29:03.636 --> 02:29:10.202]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[02:29:10.202 --> 02:29:15.287]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.

[02:29:56.681 --> 02:30:01.222]  Stacey in the great state of Texas, in FEMA Region 6.
[02:30:01.222 --> 02:30:03.243]  You're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[02:30:03.243 --> 02:30:04.323]  Good to talk to you.
[02:30:04.323 --> 02:30:08.965]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[02:30:08.965 --> 02:30:10.906]  I was turned on to the Ultimate Female Force.
[02:30:10.906 --> 02:30:13.626]  I looked at all the ingredients, and they're all organic.
[02:30:13.626 --> 02:30:15.767]  Root, things like that, that I trust.
[02:30:15.767 --> 02:30:20.049]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins that don't have things that they say that they have in them.
[02:30:20.049 --> 02:30:22.509]  And they're often not things that are natural, so I appreciate that.
[02:30:22.509 --> 02:30:24.110]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[02:30:24.110 --> 02:30:24.630]  Tell us about it.
[02:30:24.650 --> 02:30:25.471]  Well, it's really great.
[02:30:25.471 --> 02:30:26.772]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[02:30:26.772 --> 02:30:27.292]  I take it.
[02:30:27.292 --> 02:30:28.032]  It tastes good.
[02:30:28.032 --> 02:30:29.874]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[02:30:29.874 --> 02:30:31.835]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[02:30:31.835 --> 02:30:34.477]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day.
[02:30:34.477 --> 02:30:35.318]  So I really like it.
[02:30:35.318 --> 02:30:38.180]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[02:30:38.180 --> 02:30:39.941]  They're known to turbocharge women.
[02:30:39.941 --> 02:30:42.022]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[02:30:42.022 --> 02:30:45.385]  So, yeah, stamina, libido, energy.
[02:30:45.385 --> 02:30:48.207]  These are amazing things and ultimate female force.

[02:32:27.102 --> 02:32:28.764]  So I called it Ultra 12.
[02:32:28.764 --> 02:32:31.626]  And we decided, I like your Secret 12 Plus.
[02:32:31.626 --> 02:32:34.669]  But they said, look, when you do Plus, people don't get that it means better and more.
[02:32:34.669 --> 02:32:35.429]  Just call it Ultra 12.
[02:32:35.429 --> 02:32:36.190]  Well, you know what?
[02:32:36.190 --> 02:32:37.491]  I don't like how the label's printed.
[02:32:37.491 --> 02:32:39.473]  And it just so happens it had already been labeled with the other one.
[02:32:39.473 --> 02:32:40.433]  We decided to change the name.
[02:32:40.433 --> 02:32:41.654]  So when you peel off the label...
[02:32:42.875 --> 02:32:46.577]  Underneath it, it's Secret 12+.
[02:32:46.577 --> 02:32:49.378]  Twice as strong, 50% off right now.
[02:32:49.378 --> 02:32:51.278]  Better than Secret 12 ever was.

[02:32:59.342 --> 02:33:01.963]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:17.748 --> 02:33:25.371]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:25.371 --> 02:33:33.435]  Alright, Dan Lyman is a smart investigative journalist, writes amazing articles, has incredible reports on the street in very dangerous places all over Europe.
[02:33:33.435 --> 02:33:37.096]  He's an American, living with his wife in Europe.
[02:33:37.096 --> 02:33:38.037]  But let me ask you this.
[02:33:39.059 --> 02:33:40.259]  Two-fold.
[02:33:40.259 --> 02:33:54.923]  I almost feel like we're helping the system just a laundry list every day of the black plague and the diseases and the murder and the thousands of burning cars and the freedom vans running over families and the bombings.
[02:33:54.923 --> 02:34:02.085]  Instead of asking why is the political system doing this, and we know why, they want to get rid of Western culture because it's not authoritarian.
[02:34:02.865 --> 02:34:07.108]  And big megacorporations are just smashing people into poverty.
[02:34:07.108 --> 02:34:08.048]  And they want dependents.
[02:34:08.048 --> 02:34:09.549]  That's the endgame.
[02:34:09.549 --> 02:34:12.731]  But you've got to tell people how what's happening is bad.
[02:34:12.731 --> 02:34:15.133]  But you also have to tell them why it's happening.
[02:34:15.133 --> 02:34:24.399]  And I think all of us, myself included, don't spend enough time on replacement migration, Cloward and Piven, the larger reason why this is happening and where that endgame is.
[02:34:24.399 --> 02:34:27.000]  So that's two questions for you.
[02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.162]  Then I have a third question, but I'll get out before I forget it.
[02:34:30.427 --> 02:34:36.449]  How is Europe and the corrupt globalists that run the dictatorial EU responding to this?
[02:34:36.449 --> 02:34:40.871]  I mean, I know how they are responding to it, with draconian authoritarianism.
[02:34:40.871 --> 02:34:44.032]  And then by Trump not standing up to this, he's created a vacuum.
[02:34:44.032 --> 02:34:48.293]  And so social media here that operates in Europe and China is adopting their authoritarian model.
[02:34:48.293 --> 02:34:52.695]  I mean, this is an unbelievable collapse, not just of borders, but of our free speech.
[02:34:54.463 --> 02:35:05.395]  Right, I'll start with your last question first because I think that one, you know, it's really easy to get down on Trump with certain situations, especially what's going on at the southern border.
[02:35:05.395 --> 02:35:09.160]  And, you know, there are other things that we wish, promises we wish that he would fulfill.
[02:35:09.640 --> 02:35:17.868]  However, we can't place all of the blame on him or the weight of our entire movement on his shoulders because he's only one man.
[02:35:17.868 --> 02:35:19.930]  Yes, we want him to do more about internet censorship.
[02:35:19.930 --> 02:35:22.753]  He should focus on that now and what's going on at the border.
[02:35:22.753 --> 02:35:32.342]  However, I think one of the most important effects of Trump that has just been a spilloff from him and of course Brexit before him is what's happening in Europe politically.
[02:35:32.942 --> 02:35:49.916]  And the people that are starting to feel more comfortable raising their voices, you know, in on Internet comment boards and, you know, at the at the ballot box at this point, because one of the phenomenons in Europe that is so that I guess is a little bit different than what's in the way it works in the US.
[02:35:50.516 --> 02:35:55.199]  Is that there is kind of a shame culture here, especially in Northern Europe.
[02:35:55.199 --> 02:36:05.424]  If you speak, you know, against the status quo, then you will be attacked by friends, family, even more aggressively here, I've noticed, than in the U.S.
[02:36:05.424 --> 02:36:07.144]  And so that keeps people quiet.
[02:36:07.144 --> 02:36:08.505]  That keeps people quiet at work.
[02:36:08.505 --> 02:36:15.649]  That keeps them quiet when they're talking to friends and family, unless they're with a very, very... Sure, there's that well-known ice age, incredible conformity.
[02:36:16.229 --> 02:36:19.151]  Where if somebody thinks they've done a bad job, they go commit suicide.
[02:36:19.151 --> 02:36:21.073]  How do you get people out of that cult brainwashing?
[02:36:21.073 --> 02:36:26.757]  I mean, that is cultural, but it's well known that Northern Europeans, people thought Germans followed orders.
[02:36:26.757 --> 02:36:29.039]  I mean, Northern Europeans particularly just follow orders.
[02:36:29.039 --> 02:36:29.660]  It can be dangerous.
[02:36:30.823 --> 02:36:34.267]  Yeah, you know, I lived in Iceland for a while and it was just so oppressive there.
[02:36:34.267 --> 02:36:36.450]  There's no, no counter think there.
[02:36:36.450 --> 02:36:37.551]  There's nothing expressed.
[02:36:37.551 --> 02:36:41.556]  And if you did, I mean, it was like the piranhas were on you instantaneously.
[02:36:41.556 --> 02:36:49.946]  But I think that unfortunately, what it has taken is basically turning the entire society on its head and the rape out
[02:36:50.126 --> 02:36:53.167]  Yeah, because the Muslims, on average, do whatever the hell they want.
[02:36:53.167 --> 02:37:04.592]  I mean, I see articles where the judge goes, well, you're a Muslim, you're allowed to rape an 8-year-old girl, and, well, you've sexually assaulted 12 women in one week and admitted it's you, but I'm going to let you go for community service.
[02:37:04.592 --> 02:37:05.792]  Right, exactly.
[02:37:05.792 --> 02:37:18.557]  I saw that story on Europe Wars a week ago, I never covered it on air, where he just ran around sticking his hands in women's pants at grocery stores and penetrating them, I don't want to get into details, and the government just said, well, that's okay, you're a Muslim.
[02:37:20.023 --> 02:37:24.384]  And things like that are happening so often that they're almost not even worth covering.
[02:37:24.384 --> 02:37:30.947]  Not because they're not important, but there are worse things happening and it's just so much of it here and it's rampant.
[02:37:30.947 --> 02:37:33.908]  So why are the leftist judges fetishizing it?
[02:37:33.908 --> 02:37:34.908]  I mean, they obviously like it.
[02:37:36.161 --> 02:37:45.490]  Well, your guess is as good as mine, but I think a lot of these people in general are just as perverse, or they are happy with seeing society crumble, they want to see it burn.
[02:37:45.490 --> 02:37:55.200]  You know, I had a friend visiting, I'm not going to say where from, but it was his first time in Europe, Europe proper, and he was shocked by some of the things he had seen.
[02:37:55.760 --> 02:37:56.921]  French Revolution!
[02:38:17.098 --> 02:38:23.740]  Said it was for freedom, then they had a nine-day work week, changed the calendar, said we want to pull down everything, we want collapse, we want ugliness.
[02:38:23.740 --> 02:38:29.982]  It's what Winston Smith talks about in 1984, how the real goal of the party was ugliness and the collapse of humanity.
[02:38:29.982 --> 02:38:31.583]  A boot stomping on a human face forever.
[02:38:32.757 --> 02:38:34.738]  Right, exactly, the collapse of humanity.
[02:38:34.738 --> 02:38:48.884]  And you see what a great, you know, microcosm of the whole thing is the way that they're trying to destroy the Notre Dame Cathedral even worse than it has been already by just the way that they want to rebuild it just to spite traditionalism and just to spite
[02:38:49.124 --> 02:38:49.244]  It's
[02:39:10.601 --> 02:39:14.585]  Well yeah, the left came out and said, let's make it anti-christian.
[02:39:14.585 --> 02:39:16.506]  It's all about conquering the greatness.
[02:39:16.506 --> 02:39:22.531]  It's about, because they've never produced anything, the left, and so they believe that if they conquer it, that gives them the power.
[02:39:22.531 --> 02:39:25.654]  Like a headhunter thinks, eating somebody's liver gives them the power.
[02:39:26.889 --> 02:39:37.476]  Right, and ultimately most of these people will be, they will succumb to what's coming if they allow the society to continue spiraling out of control the way it is.
[02:39:37.476 --> 02:39:52.567]  So, you know, your guess is as good as mine as to why some of these people, what their motivation is, but I think it's just the nature of pure evil and the desire to see the Christian heritage of Europe destroyed and everything that it brought good to the continent.
[02:39:53.007 --> 02:39:55.628]  And that threatens the globalist AI takeover.
[02:39:55.628 --> 02:39:57.729]  Christianity, real Christianity, threatens as well.
[02:39:57.729 --> 02:39:59.430]  Europewars.com.
[02:39:59.430 --> 02:40:01.930]  Dan Lyman, there's a lot more we didn't have time to get into today.
[02:40:01.930 --> 02:40:03.751]  So much breaking there at the site.
[02:40:03.751 --> 02:40:04.471]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:40:04.471 --> 02:40:06.052]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[02:40:06.052 --> 02:40:06.592]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:40:06.592 --> 02:40:07.293]  Cheers.
[02:40:07.293 --> 02:40:08.153]  That guy's awesome.
[02:40:08.153 --> 02:40:11.134]  Europewars.com, one of our great reporters over in Europe.
[02:40:11.134 --> 02:40:18.037]  And again, that site is not on the enemy's radar as much, so it's very easy to spread that link on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, everywhere.
[02:40:18.037 --> 02:40:19.737]  Europewars.com.
[02:40:19.737 --> 02:40:21.118]  Europewars.com.
[02:40:23.171 --> 02:40:26.494]  That's how we get the information out and get it around the sensors as you word of mouth.
[02:40:26.494 --> 02:40:28.995]  So thank you and I salute you and I thank you again.
[02:40:28.995 --> 02:40:33.959]  Now we're going to break and I'm going to come back with this piece I've been mentioning.
[02:40:33.959 --> 02:40:36.962]  And then Mike Adams is coming up after that.
[02:40:36.962 --> 02:40:46.409]  But this is really a bird's eye into the soft underbelly of big tech and the real way we're going to bring them down.
[02:40:46.409 --> 02:40:47.490]  So you want answers?
[02:40:49.008 --> 02:40:50.869]  You want action?
[02:40:50.869 --> 02:40:52.610]  You want victory?
[02:40:52.610 --> 02:40:54.471]  Hey, you've been supporting us.
[02:40:54.471 --> 02:40:55.392]  You've been spreading the word.
[02:40:55.392 --> 02:40:57.113]  You've been praying for us.
[02:40:57.113 --> 02:40:59.034]  You've been buying the products.
[02:40:59.034 --> 02:41:00.335]  You've been taking action yourself.
[02:41:00.335 --> 02:41:01.856]  You've been giving us intel.
[02:41:01.856 --> 02:41:03.797]  We're winning together.
[02:41:03.797 --> 02:41:05.718]  And that's why I bring up our products.
[02:41:05.718 --> 02:41:10.822]  We sponsor ourselves because they've taken all our sponsors years ago by harassing them, so we go.
[02:41:11.934 --> 02:41:13.895]  And we get great products.
[02:41:13.895 --> 02:41:15.595]  Whatever the best rated water filter is.
[02:41:15.595 --> 02:41:17.736]  Whatever the best air filter is at the best price.
[02:41:17.736 --> 02:41:19.137]  Whatever the best supplements are.
[02:41:19.137 --> 02:41:21.318]  Whatever the best books, films, all of it.
[02:41:21.318 --> 02:41:22.238]  T-shirts.
[02:41:22.238 --> 02:41:23.799]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:41:23.799 --> 02:41:28.761]  Whether it's a shortwave radio, or an emergency radio, or optics, or whether it's supplements.
[02:41:28.761 --> 02:41:29.641]  Whatever your needs are.
[02:41:29.641 --> 02:41:33.422]  High quality coffee, protein bars, other great products.
[02:41:33.422 --> 02:41:34.883]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:41:34.883 --> 02:41:36.644]  A bunch of big specials are about to end.
[02:41:37.504 --> 02:41:42.967]  I should add this, a bottle of X2, amazing deep-earth crystal iodine, the missing link in the body.
[02:41:42.967 --> 02:41:44.628]  Nobody else has this proprietary system.
[02:41:44.628 --> 02:41:45.449]  It's incredible.
[02:41:45.449 --> 02:41:46.369]  Go read about what it does.
[02:41:46.369 --> 02:41:48.851]  Read about IQ, iodine, all of it.
[02:41:48.851 --> 02:41:53.093]  With a bottle of X3, that's the deep-earth crystal, but two other types.
[02:41:53.093 --> 02:41:54.834]  Some people absorb this better.
[02:41:54.834 --> 02:41:55.835]  It's a free bottle of X3.
[02:41:57.150 --> 02:41:57.650]  With your bottle
[02:42:20.652 --> 02:42:22.613]  Vitamin B12 out there is Methylcobalamin.
[02:42:22.613 --> 02:42:27.815]  This is double the strength, double the Methylcobalamin of Secret 12.
[02:42:27.815 --> 02:42:29.956]  When you change the formula, you're supposed to change the name.
[02:42:29.956 --> 02:42:33.757]  So it's Ultra 12 Advanced B12.
[02:42:33.757 --> 02:42:34.737]  It's amazing.
[02:42:34.737 --> 02:42:38.539]  You take it under the tongue to get better absorption.
[02:42:38.539 --> 02:42:41.440]  Infowarslife.com takes you right to supplement page.
[02:42:41.440 --> 02:42:42.060]  It's 50% off.
[02:42:42.060 --> 02:42:44.441]  I forgot to tell you that.
[02:42:44.441 --> 02:42:46.602]  So it's an introductory thing, very close to cost.
[02:42:47.303 --> 02:42:48.827]  It is 50% off.
[02:42:48.827 --> 02:42:50.673]  Ultra 12 is the new secret 12.
[02:42:50.673 --> 02:42:53.041]  Now with twice as much, Methylcobalamin.
[02:42:53.041 --> 02:42:53.843]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.

[02:45:57.184 --> 02:45:58.624]  I want to say BrainForce is great.
[02:45:58.624 --> 02:46:00.524]  I want to say TurboForce is amazing.
[02:46:00.524 --> 02:46:01.124]  It is!
[02:46:01.124 --> 02:46:02.685]  But if you took it with fish oil...
[02:46:03.980 --> 02:46:05.501]  It's like the fish oil is it.
[02:46:19.787 --> 02:46:21.988]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[02:46:47.438 --> 02:46:53.480]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[02:46:53.480 --> 02:46:59.342]  I just can't do it!
[02:46:59.342 --> 02:47:09.265]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:09.265 --> 02:47:11.186]  You lock the door.
[02:47:11.186 --> 02:47:14.387]  Don't break the key.
[02:47:15.532 --> 02:47:19.795]  There's someone in my head but it's not me
[02:47:51.967 --> 02:47:52.988]  Okay, this is the M4.
[02:47:52.988 --> 02:47:54.009]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:47:55.339 --> 02:47:57.281]  So, they sit there and they demonize us.
[02:47:57.281 --> 02:47:58.201]  They lie about us.
[02:47:58.201 --> 02:47:59.623]  Thousands of articles a month.
[02:47:59.623 --> 02:48:01.424]  Hundreds of TV shows a month.
[02:48:01.424 --> 02:48:03.826]  A conservative just saying horrible things.
[02:48:03.826 --> 02:48:05.588]  Never showing you a clip of me saying it.
[02:48:05.588 --> 02:48:06.248]  They just do it.
[02:48:06.248 --> 02:48:07.749]  They have no respect for you.
[02:48:07.749 --> 02:48:10.572]  They just churn out these lies.
[02:48:10.572 --> 02:48:14.875]  And then corporate America kicks you off your bank accounts.
[02:48:14.875 --> 02:48:16.897]  You get kicked off social media.
[02:48:16.897 --> 02:48:19.939]  You get treated like you're a Jew in Nazi Germany.
[02:48:19.939 --> 02:48:23.062]  That's a good historical parallel to what's happening.
[02:48:24.508 --> 02:48:43.457]  And so years ago, I began to learn that one big reason they wanted to go to AI computers doing censorship, which more and more they're doing, is because humans that have to listen to shows like this at Facebook and Twitter and Google and places and YouTube and censor it, well, they get radicalized, you see.
[02:48:43.457 --> 02:48:53.102]  They actually tune in and hear what we have to say versus what mainstream media is saying about us and what the corporate system
[02:48:54.488 --> 02:48:57.791]  is saying about us.
[02:48:57.791 --> 02:49:01.393]  And so PBS put out a report a few days ago.
[02:49:01.393 --> 02:49:03.935]  We're going to play some clips of it right now.
[02:49:03.935 --> 02:49:05.116]  And notice the attack.
[02:49:05.116 --> 02:49:07.818]  It's multifaceted here.
[02:49:07.818 --> 02:49:11.081]  They talk about snuff films and child molestation.
[02:49:11.081 --> 02:49:13.943]  Lots of the stuff the Democrats are into.
[02:49:13.943 --> 02:49:16.785]  And they talk about, oh, the terrible stuff Facebook has to go through.
[02:49:16.785 --> 02:49:24.131]  And you see the articles about Facebook employees have to moderate while they get PTSD having to listen to the conspiracy theorists.
[02:49:27.011 --> 02:49:32.373]  And then they talk about, oh, why we have to follow them around and watch what they're doing.
[02:49:32.373 --> 02:49:33.914]  And I've talked to sources inside these groups.
[02:49:33.914 --> 02:49:35.415]  They have PIs that watch them.
[02:49:35.415 --> 02:49:37.156]  They spy on them.
[02:49:37.156 --> 02:49:42.238]  And then sometimes, like Kanye West got sent to a mental institution for a week when he said he liked Trump.
[02:49:42.238 --> 02:49:45.019]  Sometimes they grab him and Baker Act him.
[02:49:45.019 --> 02:49:49.321]  Because, you know, if you decide, hey, we shouldn't be spying on everybody and then lying about it on the news.
[02:49:49.321 --> 02:49:51.642]  Hey, we shouldn't be controlling what words they can say.
[02:49:51.642 --> 02:49:53.343]  Hey, we're calling people things they aren't.
[02:49:54.704 --> 02:50:00.830]  Well then, that's their highest turnover, that's the groups they've got to target, that's the groups they've got to watch.
[02:50:00.830 --> 02:50:17.308]  And so really, this is your takeaway to this big segment, is around half the people that work a year or longer in quote moderation, that have even been Southern Poverty Law Center trained, they were brainwashed for years in college, they were then given a fake template about us.
[02:50:18.720 --> 02:50:21.922]  And then they get into the moderation and they freak out.
[02:50:21.922 --> 02:50:25.765]  That's why we get internal Google documents about how we're targeted last year.
[02:50:25.765 --> 02:50:26.646]  That's how this happens.
[02:50:26.646 --> 02:50:27.486]  And I knew a lot of this.
[02:50:27.486 --> 02:50:28.947]  I talked to some sources that said this.
[02:50:28.947 --> 02:50:30.308]  Mike Cernovich has said it on my show.
[02:50:30.308 --> 02:50:33.551]  He's out there with a lot of these folks.
[02:50:33.551 --> 02:50:36.733]  They love us inside Google and Facebook and Twitter, a lot of the people.
[02:50:36.733 --> 02:50:38.695]  But they have to be closeted libertarians.
[02:50:39.656 --> 02:50:53.122]  Most are conservatives, they're libertarians, and have to hide around all the crazy SJWs who are super low IQ, super aggressive, super hateful, and always accusing them of sexism or racism or weird stuff.
[02:50:53.122 --> 02:50:56.664]  So they're in the cult, and they want out of the cult.
[02:50:56.664 --> 02:51:01.906]  And there's shows that they're tasked with controlling and blocking.
[02:51:01.906 --> 02:51:03.307]  And so this is bigger than Alex Jones.
[02:51:03.307 --> 02:51:06.008]  It's bigger than those employees themselves.
[02:51:06.008 --> 02:51:06.909]  It's about whistleblowing.
[02:51:08.058 --> 02:51:14.362]  And that's what the system's really scared of, is whistleblowers and Google and Twitter and Facebook and the people that have, you know, released the videos.
[02:51:14.362 --> 02:51:17.003]  It's in Paul's new article on InfoWars.com.
[02:51:17.003 --> 02:51:19.464]  We can probably pull that up.
[02:51:19.464 --> 02:51:20.445]  I'll show you on my phone, actually.
[02:51:20.445 --> 02:51:21.906]  Let's do it that way.
[02:51:21.906 --> 02:51:23.627]  Facebook calls me dangerous.
[02:51:23.627 --> 02:51:24.607]  Imagine my shock.
[02:51:24.607 --> 02:51:25.648]  No, really?
[02:51:25.648 --> 02:51:27.549]  And if you scroll down the article,
[02:51:28.927 --> 02:51:32.708]  On Infowars.com, for some reason they've got human events pulled up.
[02:51:32.708 --> 02:51:34.848]  Hell, I'll just show you my site.
[02:51:34.848 --> 02:51:35.989]  I'll just go to my site.
[02:51:35.989 --> 02:51:39.869]  That's quicker and easier for me to do.
[02:51:39.869 --> 02:51:42.370]  And I'll just go to the old Infowars.com.
[02:51:42.370 --> 02:51:43.330]  Hell, I'll just go off air.
[02:51:43.330 --> 02:51:49.311]  That's what I'll do.
[02:51:49.311 --> 02:51:53.672]  Can I move to Canada?
[02:51:53.672 --> 02:51:56.333]  Is there anything positive you see from this election result?
[02:52:00.242 --> 02:52:03.623]  Boy, that's a really tough one right now.
[02:52:03.623 --> 02:52:17.007]  This week, Facebook banned several high-profile accounts that it says engage in violence and hate, including white supremacist, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, and a number of right-wing commentators, including Alex Jones.
[02:52:17.007 --> 02:52:26.410]  In the wake of live-streamed attacks and published threats, there are new calls for social media companies to do more to block extremism and hate.
[02:52:26.410 --> 02:52:26.990]  At Facebook,
[02:52:27.130 --> 02:52:35.215]  Thousands of real people known as moderators are the front lines of this battle, looking and listening to some horrific material.
[02:52:35.215 --> 02:52:42.960]  I recently spoke with Casey Newton, Silicon Valley editor for The Verge, who reported on the toll this content is taking on Facebook moderators.
[02:52:42.960 --> 02:52:54.188]  This is not just in the context of the New Zealand attacks, this is something that is structurally built in so that basically there are people who see things on Facebook so that the rest of us don't have to, right?
[02:52:55.816 --> 02:52:56.256]  That's right.
[02:52:56.256 --> 02:53:00.440]  Anytime you see something on Facebook that you don't like, you can click a button to report it.
[02:53:00.440 --> 02:53:06.364]  And if you do that, a human being will look at it and determine whether it violates Facebook's community standards or not.
[02:53:06.364 --> 02:53:14.690]  A lot of the stuff they see is benign, but a lot of it is really shocking and disturbing, and some of that can have a long-term toll on their lives.
[02:53:14.690 --> 02:53:21.375]  So what kind of things, without getting too graphic, what kind of things are Facebook moderators looking at pretty much all day?
[02:53:21.375 --> 02:53:21.936]  It's shift work.
[02:53:23.564 --> 02:53:24.184]  That's right.
[02:53:24.184 --> 02:53:25.726]  I mean, let's stop right there.
[02:53:25.726 --> 02:53:28.107]  You've got these poor babies.
[02:53:28.107 --> 02:53:31.930]  You've got Casey Newton from the Verge editor that goes around policing the Internet.
[02:53:31.930 --> 02:53:38.475]  And these poor babies have to sit there all day censoring people, snuff films and child porn, all the stuff the left loves.
[02:53:38.475 --> 02:53:41.537]  And then, you know, conspiracy people that question the government.
[02:53:41.537 --> 02:53:44.719]  And again, they've got PTSD and a lot of them end up believing the conspiracies.
[02:53:44.719 --> 02:53:47.521]  And then they've got to be watched in the cult.
[02:53:47.521 --> 02:53:48.762]  You see, it's all a big cult.
[02:53:48.762 --> 02:53:51.304]  You've got to watch the watchers like Winston Smith in 1984.
[02:53:51.304 --> 02:53:51.644]  Here it is.
[02:53:57.043 --> 02:54:01.770]  Uh, and, you know, sort of every flavor of violence that you can imagine.
[02:54:01.770 --> 02:54:05.695]  They're not actually going out and seeing all the pages that exist on Facebook.
[02:54:05.695 --> 02:54:06.496]  That would be impossible.
[02:54:06.496 --> 02:54:11.483]  So there's, what, an algorithm that's kind of sorting it through and then kind of held it, putting it up on a silver platter to them?
[02:54:13.120 --> 02:54:13.680]  That's right.
[02:54:13.680 --> 02:54:17.722]  So, if you see something you don't like on Facebook, you can click a button to report it.
[02:54:17.722 --> 02:54:22.823]  And all of that goes into a big queue, and then that... Yeah, pause again.
[02:54:22.823 --> 02:54:25.464]  Yeah, the algorithm is tattletales.
[02:54:25.464 --> 02:54:28.205]  Saying, I'm offended by this, I say this is hate.
[02:54:28.205 --> 02:54:34.847]  So that a human says they think something's hate, like a baby is a human, that's actually listed as hate now, and so you get banned.
[02:54:34.847 --> 02:54:36.688]  No, I'm serious, that's in the news today.
[02:54:36.688 --> 02:54:38.529]  Saying a baby is a human is now hate.
[02:54:38.529 --> 02:54:39.529]  I got it in my stack.
[02:54:42.338 --> 02:54:43.298]  See, they're the gods.
[02:54:43.298 --> 02:54:44.279]  They went to university.
[02:54:44.279 --> 02:54:45.880]  They got four or five degrees.
[02:54:45.880 --> 02:54:46.920]  They talk with a lisp.
[02:54:46.920 --> 02:54:47.761]  They're weak.
[02:54:47.761 --> 02:54:49.201]  They don't want to have kids.
[02:54:49.201 --> 02:54:52.503]  And so, they are going to rule you.
[02:54:52.503 --> 02:54:54.724]  They are going to run your life.
[02:54:54.724 --> 02:54:57.145]  They are going to control.
[02:54:57.145 --> 02:55:05.569]  So the algorithm is people complaining, like the Verge, or like Adam... or whatever the damn Stelter guy's name is.
[02:55:05.569 --> 02:55:06.330]  That's what they're doing.
[02:55:06.330 --> 02:55:06.650]  Here it is.
[02:55:07.554 --> 02:55:07.914]  We're good.
[02:55:26.385 --> 02:55:26.485]  Yeah.
[02:55:43.212 --> 02:55:49.498]  They had developed symptoms that closely resemble post-traumatic stress disorder.
[02:55:49.498 --> 02:56:02.590]  And then in another sort of strange twist, a lot of the moderators I spoke with said that the more that they reviewed content about sort of fringe conspiracy theories, the more they themselves came to believe it.
[02:56:02.590 --> 02:56:07.956]  And so a lot of the moderators I've spoken with now believe in some of the conspiracy theories that they've been asked to moderate.
[02:56:08.581 --> 02:56:11.843]  Yeah, this is a paragraph from your story.
[02:56:11.843 --> 02:56:12.203]  I want to quote.
[02:56:38.561 --> 02:56:39.381]  I don't know.
[02:56:55.866 --> 02:56:56.347]  That's right.
[02:56:56.347 --> 02:56:58.809]  We can't show you the Muslims raping and killing.
[02:56:58.809 --> 02:56:59.710]  We just have to let them in.
[02:56:59.710 --> 02:57:01.831]  We can't show you the open borders with all the disease.
[02:57:01.831 --> 02:57:04.814]  We can't show you the Satan that's running around brainwashing kids.
[02:57:04.814 --> 02:57:07.496]  We can't show you the children being targeted.
[02:57:07.496 --> 02:57:12.641]  And again, they go on to talk about, oh, and some of the people actually start believing these conspiracy theories, you see.
[02:57:12.641 --> 02:57:17.965]  So it's all just how they're going to take care of everything, and you're going to be on these big platforms.
[02:57:17.965 --> 02:57:19.266]  They're going to control what you can say.
[02:57:19.266 --> 02:57:20.908]  They're going to control what you can do.
[02:57:20.908 --> 02:57:23.030]  They're going to control how you live your lives.
[02:57:24.156 --> 02:57:25.257]  That's how they do it.
[02:57:25.257 --> 02:57:28.339]  And I shouldn't say visit Infowars.com or Newswars.com.
[02:57:28.339 --> 02:57:28.979]  Who really cares?
[02:57:28.979 --> 02:57:29.560]  You know what I mean?
[02:57:29.560 --> 02:57:31.421]  Nobody really cares anymore.
[02:57:31.421 --> 02:57:36.284]  Everybody's gonna watch Netflix till the reactors start melting down and the new war starts.
[02:57:36.284 --> 02:57:39.486]  It is gonna be a huge world war and billions are gonna die.
[02:57:39.486 --> 02:57:43.509]  Because humans are weak, people are stupid, and they want to die!
[02:57:47.877 --> 02:57:57.287]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.

[02:58:46.721 --> 02:58:49.082]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[02:58:49.082 --> 02:58:55.686]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids get their EPA and DHA too.

[02:59:49.311 --> 02:59:52.014]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:05.000 --> 03:00:11.624]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:11.624 --> 03:00:17.188]  All right, Mike Adams is taking over in the fourth hour.
[03:00:17.188 --> 03:00:18.288]  I'm in the war room with Owen Shroyer.
[03:00:18.288 --> 03:00:18.749]  He's coming up.
[03:00:21.009 --> 03:00:37.034]  Just to watch how the globalists turn the censors that are minding us and lying about us and controlling us into victims of PTSD because they have to read the horrible things us conservatives are saying and they mix us in with child molesters.
[03:00:37.034 --> 03:00:44.316]  It's what they do and it's sick and they will get defeated just like they're getting defeated on Russiagate and Spygate and everything else.
[03:00:44.316 --> 03:00:47.377]  The chickens are coming home to roost and they will not get away with it.
[03:00:49.278 --> 03:00:51.038]  That's an absolute guarantee.
[03:00:51.038 --> 03:00:51.819]  You know that.
[03:00:51.819 --> 03:00:52.399]  I know that.
[03:00:52.399 --> 03:00:52.899]  We know that.
[03:00:52.899 --> 03:00:56.319]  It's going to happen.
[03:00:56.319 --> 03:01:06.862]  But as Nietzsche said, don't spend too much time looking in the abyss, lest you become the abyss.
[03:01:06.862 --> 03:01:14.043]  There's really something to just live in our own lives and doing what we do politically, but not giving all our time to the system.
[03:01:17.008 --> 03:01:20.796]  Because I'm not, I wouldn't call, I'm not depressed.
[03:01:20.796 --> 03:01:23.501]  I'm sick of looking at John Brennan and James Clapper.
[03:01:24.659 --> 03:01:43.503]  I'm sick of every day seeing more censorship and classical high-tech tyranny taking over every facet of our lives and the left, all these slaves of the system, who are going to be thrown away as soon as the AI is fully in place, running around talking about how they're for free speech one minute because Trump's criticizing the press.
[03:01:43.503 --> 03:01:45.964]  Criticizing the press doesn't violate free speech.
[03:01:45.964 --> 03:01:47.364]  It's called free speech.
[03:01:47.364 --> 03:01:49.945]  But then when they want to stop your speech, it's high and mighty.
[03:01:49.945 --> 03:01:51.045]  I'm sick of them.
[03:01:52.625 --> 03:01:55.146]  So I'm not appeasing liberals anymore.
[03:01:55.146 --> 03:01:56.246]  I'm not kissing their ass.
[03:01:56.246 --> 03:01:59.347]  And you know, it's a form of virtue signaling.
[03:01:59.347 --> 03:02:05.208]  It's a form of virtue signaling that you gotta make everybody comfortable.
[03:02:05.208 --> 03:02:12.130]  You gotta just act like if anybody's a woman or a man or they're black or they're white, if you're black, you gotta act this way around white people.
[03:02:12.130 --> 03:02:16.851]  Or if you're white, you gotta act like this around black people.
[03:02:16.851 --> 03:02:21.372]  Because you know, I've sat there before when I'm
[03:02:24.508 --> 03:02:26.728]  How people don't know and stuff.
[03:02:26.728 --> 03:02:30.829]  And then if there's a black person there, they act different.
[03:02:30.829 --> 03:02:32.250]  And they don't do it because they're racist or whatever.
[03:02:32.250 --> 03:02:33.330]  It's like a virtue signal.
[03:02:33.330 --> 03:02:37.051]  And you gotta understand, those are conservatives do that.
[03:02:37.051 --> 03:02:40.011]  The left does that like a thousand times worse.
[03:02:40.011 --> 03:02:51.173]  It's just, it's this weird mental illness, like you count so much, you're gonna act a certain way for somebody else because it's a form of hospitality.
[03:02:51.173 --> 03:02:53.334]  No, it's a form of mental illness.
[03:02:54.915 --> 03:03:01.521]  It's sick.
[03:03:01.521 --> 03:03:09.869]  But imagine if you were sitting there, hypothetical story, and you got three daughters at a birthday party, and you say, man, I got the best, sweetest daughters in the world.
[03:03:09.869 --> 03:03:13.332]  And then your mom looks at you and says, oh, but your wife's great too.
[03:03:13.332 --> 03:03:15.054]  See how that's SJW?
[03:03:15.054 --> 03:03:16.835]  I read about that in a news article.
[03:03:16.835 --> 03:03:18.797]  See how SJW that is?
[03:03:18.797 --> 03:03:20.579]  That you can't say your daughters are great.
[03:03:21.704 --> 03:03:26.168]  Without saying your wife's great, your mother says.
[03:03:26.168 --> 03:03:30.492]  And if you want to know liberal programming in the last 50, 60 years, that's what it's like.
[03:03:30.492 --> 03:03:32.894]  No one else can succeed unless others do.
[03:03:32.894 --> 03:03:35.657]  Well, there's no such thing as that.
[03:03:35.657 --> 03:03:43.824]  And so that's the virtue signal, is that everybody gets a participation trophy.
[03:03:43.824 --> 03:03:44.364]  Everybody
[03:03:45.322 --> 03:04:03.109]  And you gotta understand, the next level of that is, all the so-called groups, which is usually weird meth-head looking white people, that don't have power because they're just weak, stupid, lazy, dumb people, neurotic perverts, you've now gotta let them run your life in some new virtue signal.
[03:04:03.109 --> 03:04:05.850]  No, I'm not gonna virtue signal anybody anymore.
[03:04:05.850 --> 03:04:10.692]  And I never really did it, but I'm gonna be authentic, and that's the end of it.
[03:04:10.692 --> 03:04:14.714]  Authenticity is what matters, and nothing else anymore.
[03:04:16.502 --> 03:04:18.984]  And you know, I'm going to work as hard as I can to do this peacefully.
[03:04:18.984 --> 03:04:21.906]  But we're going to win the peaceful fight.
[03:04:21.906 --> 03:04:25.488]  And the globalists are going to start a violent thing with us.
[03:04:25.488 --> 03:04:28.951]  And so I tell everybody.
[03:04:28.951 --> 03:04:29.872]  Work for peace.
[03:04:29.872 --> 03:04:32.053]  Work for peaceful resolutions.
[03:04:32.053 --> 03:04:35.175]  Work to wake folks up so we have a bigger number of people that are awake.
[03:04:35.175 --> 03:04:37.797]  But have a defense plan for yourself.
[03:04:37.797 --> 03:04:42.621]  And then if they want to get off the porch and start a fight, we're going to give it to them.
[03:04:42.621 --> 03:04:44.162]  And we'll send them to Satan real fast.
[03:04:45.168 --> 03:04:46.270]  They'll be in hell real quick.
[03:04:46.270 --> 03:04:48.315]  We'll send them down there to their papa.
[03:04:54.184 --> 03:04:59.386]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[03:04:59.386 --> 03:05:07.970]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[03:05:07.970 --> 03:05:10.952]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[03:05:10.952 --> 03:05:12.692]  How can I solve that problem?
[03:05:12.692 --> 03:05:18.955]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[03:05:21.056 --> 03:05:26.378]  The Alexa Pure Breeze Groundbreaking Ion Cluster Air Filter Technology.
[03:05:26.378 --> 03:05:29.320]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[03:05:29.320 --> 03:05:33.181]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[03:05:33.181 --> 03:05:37.243]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[03:05:37.243 --> 03:05:39.064]  I've got two in my home.
[03:05:39.064 --> 03:05:45.166]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[03:05:45.166 --> 03:05:46.007]  Don't live
[03:05:46.827 --> 03:05:50.888]  In a polluted major city in your home, have clean air.
[03:05:50.888 --> 03:06:05.272]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:06:05.272 --> 03:06:08.112]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[03:06:08.112 --> 03:06:10.933]  It's time for you to choose a side.
[03:06:10.933 --> 03:06:13.254]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:06:30.244 --> 03:06:35.465]  All right, Mike Adams, the health ranger of naturalnews.com is about to take over.
[03:06:35.465 --> 03:06:46.308]  But I want to add an addendum to the Hell's Satan movie I went and saw last night in Alamo Draft House watching weird... I'm going to call them effeminate because that insults women.
[03:06:46.308 --> 03:06:54.330]  Very weak, strange, unnatural people wiggling around in their chairs thinking they were watching something naughty.
[03:06:56.670 --> 03:07:04.340]  The one thing they got right in the movie was when they talked about how they went to try to do a black mass by a Catholic Church at Harvard.
[03:07:04.340 --> 03:07:07.203]  The Catholics came out and massed by the thousands and said, this is evil, this is bad.
[03:07:07.203 --> 03:07:12.189]  And they said, hey, the Catholic Church in the US has abused thousands of young boys and covered it up.
[03:07:12.970 --> 03:07:14.171]  And so don't tell us we're bad.
[03:07:14.171 --> 03:07:17.272]  Well, yeah, that's Satanists getting into the Catholic Church, doing that.
[03:07:17.272 --> 03:07:19.293]  That's how they really infiltrate and do it.
[03:07:19.293 --> 03:07:30.918]  It turns out many of the abused boys and girls in the Catholic Church that's come out in the police reports were actually abused in black masses, carried out inside of the churches.
[03:07:30.918 --> 03:07:33.859]  That's real blasphemy.
[03:07:33.859 --> 03:07:37.000]  So there they were saying, oh, look what Christians do to people.
[03:07:37.000 --> 03:07:41.022]  No, that's being done as Satanists infiltrating Christian and Catholic churches.
[03:07:42.210 --> 03:07:48.753]  But they are able to point at big organized religion and say, oh, that's where the real evil is.
[03:07:48.753 --> 03:08:04.620]  But again, it's come out of Pennsylvania and many other areas that the priests are getting altar boys in there at night in black magic rituals and black masses and giving them the sacraments of you-know-what.
[03:08:05.905 --> 03:08:09.546]  And so I wanted to point that out, that that's how sick the Satanists are.
[03:08:09.546 --> 03:08:11.787]  It's the Satanists that say kill babies after they're born.
[03:08:11.787 --> 03:08:13.668]  It's the Satanists that say go after unborn babies.
[03:08:13.668 --> 03:08:15.628]  It's the Satanists that are obsessed with all this.
[03:08:15.628 --> 03:08:32.874]  And now they tell you all over the news that though this is your new movement and it's a pathetic movement of a bunch of jellyfish being promoted in major movies and everywhere else that you should go join this as the new liberal thing, it's completely and totally and absolutely out of control at so many levels.
[03:08:36.041 --> 03:08:37.923]  And so this is the fall of society.
[03:08:37.923 --> 03:08:39.984]  Many historians have written about it.
[03:08:39.984 --> 03:08:52.274]  When you have plenty of food, plenty of water, plenty of everything, and people just get decadent, they don't want to work, they start demanding more and more of the system, they organize into gangs, and then what do a bunch of lazy people that never do any work want?
[03:08:52.274 --> 03:08:54.276]  They want power.
[03:08:54.276 --> 03:08:56.218]  They want control of the system.
[03:08:56.218 --> 03:09:01.082]  They want to overthrow the system, but they don't want to overthrow the system, they want to be the system.
[03:09:02.526 --> 03:09:06.128]  And America, in many states and areas, is satanic now.
[03:09:06.128 --> 03:09:09.451]  In all your major blue states and blue cities, it's about the elites.
[03:09:09.451 --> 03:09:10.571]  It's about the corrupt.
[03:09:10.571 --> 03:09:11.892]  They're all tax-exempt.
[03:09:11.892 --> 03:09:13.293]  They get away with what they want.
[03:09:13.293 --> 03:09:14.634]  They have the power, the control.
[03:09:14.634 --> 03:09:21.598]  Does that mean that the Satanist pointed a bunch of weird, corrupt, fake Christianoids that are just there for their own political power?
[03:09:21.598 --> 03:09:26.281]  And a bunch of hypocrites that that then, you know, makes the Satanist good because the Christians are fake?
[03:09:26.281 --> 03:09:26.842]  No, it doesn't.
[03:09:27.779 --> 03:09:35.422]  The issue is it's being rolled out in mass against humanity on a huge scale.
[03:09:35.422 --> 03:09:46.965]  And they're saying in every newspaper in the country, the new religion is Satanism because the Democrats first get you away from realizing spirituality and tell you there is no God but yourself, humanism.
[03:09:46.965 --> 03:09:52.147]  And they go, by the way, meet the God of humanism, Satan, but actually he's not the God of humans.
[03:09:52.147 --> 03:09:53.748]  He's the God of your enslavement.
[03:09:53.748 --> 03:09:56.789]  And so that's what I'm saying is whether you believe in God or not, these archetypes
[03:09:58.069 --> 03:10:00.170]  The establishment is surveilling you.
[03:10:00.170 --> 03:10:02.531]  The establishment is telling you what speech you have.
[03:10:02.531 --> 03:10:04.572]  The establishment is telling you you don't have children.
[03:10:04.572 --> 03:10:06.373]  The establishment is telling you what to do.
[03:10:06.373 --> 03:10:10.015]  I thought the left-hand path was going to give everybody this freedom!
[03:10:10.015 --> 03:10:18.300]  But you look at the left-hand path's people, they look like a bunch of dead zombies who had their souls sucked out, because that's what they are.
[03:10:18.300 --> 03:10:20.801]  A bunch of nobodies trying to act powerful.
[03:10:23.362 --> 03:10:24.463]  Mike Adams has taken over.
[03:10:24.463 --> 03:10:34.213]  Please don't forget, the way we circumnavigate and override the censorship of big tech that is now to the next level is your human action and your will.
[03:10:34.213 --> 03:10:38.577]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, the free podcast, InfoWars.com.
[03:10:38.577 --> 03:10:40.359]  Go sign up for it, a couple clicks.
[03:10:40.359 --> 03:10:42.821]  Spreading the link, saying this is the verboten transmission.
[03:10:42.821 --> 03:10:44.203]  This is what the system doesn't want you to have.
[03:10:45.575 --> 03:10:49.577]  Theaters across the country banned this year and wouldn't let it show.
[03:10:49.577 --> 03:10:51.178]  That was number five in theaters.
[03:10:51.178 --> 03:10:54.660]  Unplanned about the beauty of having a baby.
[03:10:54.660 --> 03:10:56.781]  But in this film, they're putting it in all the theaters.
[03:10:56.781 --> 03:10:59.382]  There's no problem there.
[03:10:59.382 --> 03:11:00.823]  They're saying, get rid of your babies.
[03:11:00.823 --> 03:11:01.323]  They're bad.
[03:11:01.323 --> 03:11:02.884]  Empower yourself as a woman.
[03:11:02.884 --> 03:11:03.685]  Kill your child.
[03:11:03.685 --> 03:11:04.285]  That's in the movie.
[03:11:06.547 --> 03:11:11.069]  And it's all about how they're for free speech and the Christians are trying to stop them.
[03:11:11.069 --> 03:11:16.151]  Oh yeah, it's the left censoring and controlling everywhere.
[03:11:16.151 --> 03:11:20.593]  If the Satanist film didn't get showed in theaters, they'd pitch a complaint.
[03:11:20.593 --> 03:11:25.155]  When the Christians get wadded up and thrown in the trash can.
[03:11:25.155 --> 03:11:29.197]  It's a private company.
[03:11:29.197 --> 03:11:32.999]  They use our own tolerance and openness against us.
[03:11:34.966 --> 03:11:38.770]  Don't give to colleges that are your alumni that are not for free speech.
[03:11:38.770 --> 03:11:41.232]  Don't eat at restaurants if they're owned by leftists.
[03:11:41.232 --> 03:11:42.533]  They don't want us in their restaurants.
[03:11:42.533 --> 03:11:43.714]  They don't want us in their bars.
[03:11:43.714 --> 03:11:44.555]  They don't want us around them.
[03:11:44.555 --> 03:11:45.196]  Good!
[03:11:45.196 --> 03:11:46.677]  We don't want to be around you.
[03:11:46.677 --> 03:11:48.098]  Pull out of them.
[03:11:48.098 --> 03:11:49.319]  They need us.
[03:11:49.319 --> 03:11:51.622]  They're the vampires.
[03:11:51.622 --> 03:11:53.203]  They're the ones turned over to evil.
[03:11:53.203 --> 03:11:53.904]  They're the fallen.
[03:11:55.478 --> 03:11:58.480]  And support the broadcast that tell the truth.
[03:11:58.480 --> 03:12:02.082]  Support the broadcast and do it as an act of will against the enemy.
[03:12:02.082 --> 03:12:07.725]  If they can shut this broadcast down, they have victory over free speech in totality.
[03:12:07.725 --> 03:12:08.726]  And they know that.
[03:12:08.726 --> 03:12:10.627]  And that's why everything we do is symbiotic.
[03:12:10.627 --> 03:12:23.795]  And that's why it's exciting to see people excited about the new products we have and things like Ultra 12 that's double the amount of methylcobalamin, the highest quality B12 available for 50% off.
[03:12:25.589 --> 03:12:26.670]  You cannot beat this.
[03:12:26.670 --> 03:12:27.630]  Nothing like it.
[03:12:27.630 --> 03:12:30.511]  $24.95 for the best vitamin B12 out there.
[03:12:30.511 --> 03:12:32.252]  Now twice as strong.
[03:12:32.252 --> 03:12:37.234]  I signed a multi-year contract to be able to get you this price, and now it's half off.
[03:12:37.234 --> 03:12:38.395]  So you see how great it is.
[03:12:38.395 --> 03:12:44.058]  Again, no reviews yet because it's really Secret 12+.
[03:12:44.058 --> 03:12:44.758]  Just came out.
[03:12:44.758 --> 03:12:49.260]  Go look at Secret 12 and its reviews and get it.
[03:12:49.260 --> 03:12:51.141]  You need the products we have.
[03:12:51.141 --> 03:12:52.722]  You need the highest rated.
[03:12:53.809 --> 03:12:57.271]  Alexa Pure Pro, Gravity Fed Stainless Steel Filter.
[03:12:57.271 --> 03:12:58.592]  They sold to us at their cost.
[03:12:58.592 --> 03:13:00.953]  We tagged 50 bucks on it so we could fund ourselves.
[03:13:00.953 --> 03:13:02.934]  You need the heirloom seeds.
[03:13:02.934 --> 03:13:08.057]  You need everything you need, like water filters, seeds, supplements, food.
[03:13:08.057 --> 03:13:10.519]  We're not selling you upside down crosses.
[03:13:10.519 --> 03:13:18.343]  We're not selling you little dead baby necklaces you wear around your neck as you celebrate the death of new humans and the innocent and show us how powerful you are.
[03:13:19.404 --> 03:13:21.425]  We are selling life.
[03:13:21.425 --> 03:13:24.545]  We are promoting symbiotic relationships.
[03:13:24.545 --> 03:13:26.046]  And am I in a rage against these people?
[03:13:26.046 --> 03:13:28.887]  You bet I am, because they're so weak!
[03:13:28.887 --> 03:13:33.128]  And the fact that they're able to even get this toehold on us is pathetic!
[03:13:33.128 --> 03:13:35.408]  Right here in this republic!
[03:13:35.408 --> 03:13:38.029]  God gave us free will to choose good and evil.
[03:13:38.029 --> 03:13:40.390]  That's why our republic was the first country.
[03:13:41.448 --> 03:13:50.432]  To say we don't have a state-run religion, not because we weren't founded by Christians, but because real Christians said, you have free will!
[03:13:50.432 --> 03:13:55.894]  And this country was founded by Puritans who didn't want to be under the Church of England!
[03:13:55.894 --> 03:13:57.835]  And didn't want to be under the Catholic Church!
[03:13:57.835 --> 03:13:59.916]  That's why we have separation of church and state!
[03:13:59.916 --> 03:14:01.717]  It doesn't mean you can't preach the Bible!
[03:14:01.717 --> 03:14:03.598]  It doesn't mean you can't hand out Christmas cards!
[03:14:03.598 --> 03:14:08.220]  It doesn't mean you can't say, I'm a valedictorian, and thanks to Jesus, you have your speech!
[03:14:08.220 --> 03:14:10.681]  It means there can't be a state-run religion!
[03:14:12.014 --> 03:14:16.342]  Of a state, or a city, or a county, or a nation!
[03:14:16.342 --> 03:14:16.863]  You understand that?
[03:14:17.915 --> 03:14:18.755]  It's right there.
[03:14:18.755 --> 03:14:22.697]  Congress will make no law respecting an established religion, or per the free exercise thereof.
[03:14:22.697 --> 03:14:25.998]  And then he goes to the freedom of the press, the right to assemble, petition to read us grievances.
[03:14:25.998 --> 03:14:27.438]  That's the First Amendment.
[03:14:27.438 --> 03:14:39.822]  But now in movies, the Satanists are the champions of free speech, when they're the champions of cults, and bondage, and pain, and lies, and fraud, and weakness, and death!
[03:14:39.822 --> 03:14:43.023]  God is the God of life, and success, and real power!
[03:14:43.023 --> 03:14:46.324]  And the enemy knows that, and they can't stand it!
[03:14:47.728 --> 03:14:54.694]  So again, separation of church and state is, we don't have a state-run one religion.
[03:14:54.694 --> 03:14:56.576]  That would be a cult.
[03:14:56.576 --> 03:15:00.639]  We have religion protected in this country.
[03:15:00.639 --> 03:15:03.101]  And we were founded by Christians.
[03:15:03.101 --> 03:15:04.522]  Was there a handful of theists in there?
[03:15:04.522 --> 03:15:05.323]  Yes!
[03:15:05.323 --> 03:15:09.066]  The point is, Christians believe in freedom.
[03:15:09.066 --> 03:15:10.868]  Christians believe in free will.
[03:15:10.868 --> 03:15:15.392]  Christians don't threaten to kill you if you follow the Bible, the New Testament, if you don't convert.
[03:15:17.563 --> 03:15:18.730]  That's what we're talking about.
[03:15:18.730 --> 03:15:21.524]  And this isn't at the final equation even about that.
[03:15:23.157 --> 03:15:40.591]  It's about the operating system of world government that's anti-human, anti-God, anti-progress, anti-child, a death cult of globalists who've been promised that they're going to have silicon power and be new creatures as long as they kill the scourge that is humans.
[03:15:40.591 --> 03:15:47.056]  That is the operating system of Silicon Valley, of Hollywood, of the Democratic Party, and that is the truth.
[03:15:47.056 --> 03:15:48.877]  Mike Adams takes over in minutes.
[03:15:48.877 --> 03:15:49.378]  Stay with us.
[03:15:53.442 --> 03:15:54.663]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:15:54.663 --> 03:15:58.586]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:15:58.586 --> 03:16:00.127]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:16:00.127 --> 03:16:03.089]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:16:03.089 --> 03:16:08.653]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:16:08.653 --> 03:16:09.854]  I can help you, too.
[03:16:09.854 --> 03:16:12.776]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:16:12.776 --> 03:16:14.998]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:16:14.998 --> 03:16:19.441]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[03:16:19.441 --> 03:16:21.743]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[03:16:22.964 --> 03:16:29.307]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[03:16:29.307 --> 03:16:32.348]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[03:16:32.348 --> 03:16:38.270]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[03:16:38.270 --> 03:16:42.072]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[03:16:42.072 --> 03:16:43.332]  Was there ever a vote?
[03:16:43.332 --> 03:16:44.673]  Who do we fight for?
[03:16:44.673 --> 03:16:50.875]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[03:16:50.875 --> 03:16:52.296]  Available at Amazon Books.
[03:16:52.896 --> 03:16:55.098]  Okay, so a watch is good, and some jewelry.
[03:16:55.098 --> 03:16:56.379]  Better grab some flowers, too.
[03:16:56.379 --> 03:16:57.280]  Hey, whatcha doin'?
[03:16:57.280 --> 03:16:58.481]  Ah, Mother's Day, remember?
[03:16:58.481 --> 03:16:58.801]  Oh, yeah.
[03:16:58.801 --> 03:17:03.145]  So I'm making lists, gotta plan a trip to the store, then need to save all the receipts in case she wants to return.
[03:17:03.145 --> 03:17:04.846]  Uh, you know there's an easier way, right?
[03:17:04.846 --> 03:17:06.047]  I'm guessing you do?

[03:17:54.167 --> 03:17:57.770]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[03:17:57.770 --> 03:17:59.551]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[03:17:59.551 --> 03:18:10.819]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[03:18:11.599 --> 03:18:20.788]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[03:18:20.788 --> 03:18:26.753]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[03:18:26.753 --> 03:18:31.838]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[03:18:31.838 --> 03:18:34.100]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[03:18:34.440 --> 03:18:36.161]  It is not an antihistamine.
[03:18:36.161 --> 03:18:46.170]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[03:18:46.170 --> 03:18:48.812]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[03:18:48.812 --> 03:18:53.516]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[03:18:54.156 --> 03:18:58.059]  BrainForce Plus is a top-tier nootropin.

[03:19:16.093 --> 03:19:20.176]  It's not very profitable because we give it at such a low price, but it's amazing.

[03:19:56.742 --> 03:19:59.424]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:10.447 --> 03:20:17.130]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[03:20:17.130 --> 03:20:19.451]  It's Mike Adams.
[03:20:19.451 --> 03:20:22.272]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:24.662 --> 03:20:25.943]  Alright, thanks for tuning in, folks.
[03:20:25.943 --> 03:20:28.445]  Mike Adams here taking over for the remainder of the fourth hour.
[03:20:28.445 --> 03:20:30.267]  I've got a packed broadcast for you.
[03:20:30.267 --> 03:20:32.008]  I need to apologize up front.
[03:20:32.008 --> 03:20:39.055]  We've got these massive storms swinging through here, central Texas, and there might be glitches in the bandwidth.
[03:20:39.055 --> 03:20:39.775]  That's all I'm saying.
[03:20:39.775 --> 03:20:40.996]  It's not InfoWars servers.
[03:20:40.996 --> 03:20:41.557]  It's my fault.
[03:20:42.097 --> 03:20:49.562]  My studio's bandwidth is weather-impacted sometimes, so if I get disconnected or glitchy, just ask for your patience.
[03:20:49.562 --> 03:20:51.643]  And it actually is my fault.
[03:20:51.643 --> 03:20:57.346]  I have an old John Deere tractor, built in the 1970s, and it has no emissions controls.
[03:20:57.346 --> 03:21:10.854]  And over the, I don't know, it was a few days ago, I let it idle for 20 minutes because I was trying to charge the battery and warm up the oil, you know, to gas off any moisture that might have condensed inside the engine, because I hadn't run it for a while.
[03:21:10.854 --> 03:21:11.575]  And I'm told that
[03:21:12.364 --> 03:21:20.209]  My John Deere tractor emitted so many tons of carbon dioxide that it unleashed this entire storm system across four states.
[03:21:20.209 --> 03:21:24.933]  So it actually is my fault, and I apologize for all the storms.
[03:21:24.933 --> 03:21:37.061]  I'll try to idle the tractor a little bit less next time, but just a warning, if you have a diesel engine out there, just know if you idle that diesel engine, you might unleash a volcano, or an earthquake, or a hurricane.
[03:21:38.092 --> 03:21:39.916]  Or, I don't know, a meteor or something.
[03:21:39.916 --> 03:21:40.297]  Who knows?
[03:21:40.297 --> 03:21:43.965]  This is what we're being told by the eco-fascists.
[03:21:43.965 --> 03:21:48.595]  Also, my day was very confusing because this morning I woke up and...
[03:21:49.511 --> 03:21:58.116]  I found this little switch on the side of my kitchen sink and I flipped it on and the sink made this incredibly horrific, scary sound like the sink was screaming at me.
[03:21:58.116 --> 03:22:03.939]  I didn't know what was going on, so I called Ocasio-Cortez and I asked her, what is this thing?
[03:22:03.939 --> 03:22:09.982]  She said, I don't know, but everybody online is telling me that there's free food in there if you just reach in there and grab it.
[03:22:09.982 --> 03:22:15.365]  So I decided not to take that advice, which is why I've got all the fingers here.
[03:22:16.113 --> 03:22:18.154]  And we are ready to go.
[03:22:18.154 --> 03:22:20.014]  Thank goodness for that.
[03:22:20.014 --> 03:22:26.316]  Boy, I mean, who needs satire when these people mock themselves with everything they say.
[03:22:26.316 --> 03:22:29.617]  Every time they open their mouths, they're mocking themselves.
[03:22:29.617 --> 03:22:30.977]  It's quite hilarious.
[03:22:30.977 --> 03:22:34.078]  It's like Comedy Hour in Washington, D.C.
[03:22:34.078 --> 03:22:36.339]  every time AOC opens her mouth.
[03:22:36.339 --> 03:22:38.159]  Now, on to serious subjects.
[03:22:38.159 --> 03:22:40.340]  This is not a joke broadcast.
[03:22:40.340 --> 03:22:43.481]  I've got many, many serious items to cover today.
[03:22:43.481 --> 03:22:43.981]  First of all,
[03:22:47.844 --> 03:22:57.267]  Following from what Alex Jones just said, he is absolutely right that there is a plan to cull about 90% of the human population.
[03:22:57.267 --> 03:23:08.471]  And he's also absolutely right that humanity has become incredibly weak after many, many generations of abundant food, easy economics, relatively easy money.
[03:23:08.471 --> 03:23:14.433]  There's so much weakness and really stupidity that's in the system now, that's in the population now.
[03:23:15.093 --> 03:23:26.699]  It continues to astonish me every single day, but it also reflects, it reflects what you've seen in laboratory experiments on animals as well as bacteria.
[03:23:26.699 --> 03:23:32.723]  And I'm not trying to compare humans to bacteria here, but it's an insightful study.
[03:23:32.723 --> 03:23:40.847]  I remember reading about a study where you just take a petri dish and you have bacteria there, as long as they have easy food, you know, like agar mixes that are in there.
[03:23:41.508 --> 03:23:47.795]  As long as they have easy food, the bacteria multiply and breed and everything is great.
[03:23:47.795 --> 03:23:54.443]  And the bacteria actually get weaker and weaker as long as everything is good because they don't have any challenges.
[03:23:54.443 --> 03:23:55.705]  They don't have to adapt.
[03:23:55.705 --> 03:23:57.066]  They don't have to survive.
[03:23:57.066 --> 03:24:01.071]  It's just endless replication and they're just spreading across the big Petri dish.
[03:24:01.647 --> 03:24:07.235]  Well, once the food supply begins to run out, what happens to those bacteria?
[03:24:07.235 --> 03:24:13.303]  It turns out that they begin to fight with each other over shrinking resources.
[03:24:13.303 --> 03:24:18.150]  So the resources are diminishing, the bacteria start to actually produce chemical weapons.
[03:24:18.690 --> 03:24:19.351]  We're good to go.
[03:24:34.918 --> 03:24:37.779]  I don't know, like coyotes or wolves or something.
[03:24:37.779 --> 03:24:41.800]  And you just let them breed in every easy food, no problems, no challenges.
[03:24:41.800 --> 03:24:45.241]  They get lazier and more pathetic generation after generation.
[03:24:45.241 --> 03:24:51.643]  And then at some point when the resources start to run out, they turn on each other and they start going to war with each other.
[03:24:51.643 --> 03:25:00.585]  And you might say that this is some of what's happening in humanity right now, except that it's the globalists that have declared war on humanity and have decided that
[03:25:01.255 --> 03:25:10.178]  They must destroy the planet, I'm sorry, well the human population on the planet in order to what they believe is saving the planet.
[03:25:10.178 --> 03:25:16.639]  So there is, there is a massive plan to annihilate most of humanity.
[03:25:16.639 --> 03:25:18.380]  Now what does it have to do with you right now?
[03:25:18.380 --> 03:25:25.702]  Well the censorship that we're seeing, this extreme censorship, is preparing the online landscape
[03:25:26.536 --> 03:25:36.244]  For the proper official narrative that will tell you what you are allowed to believe about this wipeout of humanity as it is taking place.
[03:25:36.244 --> 03:25:40.588]  Please understand, censorship is being done not for the sake of censorship.
[03:25:40.588 --> 03:25:51.637]  Censorship is being done for the reason to allow the narrative to be completely controlled by the globalists as they unleash whatever they are planning to unleash.
[03:25:52.917 --> 03:25:55.600]  One likely scenario is biological weapons.
[03:25:55.600 --> 03:25:57.462]  Engineered bioweapons, released.
[03:25:57.462 --> 03:26:00.046]  The ones that they're testing in Africa all the time.
[03:26:00.046 --> 03:26:06.093]  Unleashing them in North America and Europe and Asia and India and so on.
[03:26:06.093 --> 03:26:06.974]  That's one scenario.
[03:26:06.974 --> 03:26:11.660]  Another scenario is a grid down, like a simulated solar flare attack.
[03:26:12.389 --> 03:26:24.696]  That they could actually achieve through malicious cyberware or they could achieve through by launching nuclear weapons on themselves and detonating nuclear weapons for an EMP effect at high altitude on themselves.
[03:26:24.696 --> 03:26:38.905]  So the globalist countries in Europe and deep state elements within the United States and perhaps those in India and China, there might be a globalist coordinated effort to try to depopulate the planet, but they can't ever take the blame for it.
[03:26:38.905 --> 03:26:40.346]  So they have to blame the sun.
[03:26:41.181 --> 03:26:42.222]  Blame a solar flare.
[03:26:42.222 --> 03:26:45.065]  Blame, I don't know, rocks from space.
[03:26:45.065 --> 03:26:46.005]  Whatever they need to blame.
[03:26:46.005 --> 03:26:47.347]  Meteors.
[03:26:47.347 --> 03:26:50.249]  Basically, space weather is the official term for that.
[03:26:50.249 --> 03:26:52.351]  They have to have a narrative.
[03:26:52.351 --> 03:26:58.417]  And I remember there was a documentary by a ufologist, I think his name is Steven Greer, Dr. Steven Greer.
[03:27:00.319 --> 03:27:18.153]  I interviewed him once, and he told me, this is his view, not my words, but his words, that he believed there was going to be what he called a cosmic false flag, where he believes that the globalists were going to fake an alien invasion to try to enslave humankind.
[03:27:18.153 --> 03:27:23.637]  That they were going to fake, you know, spaceships or something.
[03:27:23.637 --> 03:27:28.100]  Fake... I mean, look, they control the narrative, so I guess they can fake anything they want.
[03:27:29.739 --> 03:27:37.604]  Almost everything that we've seen that's been a big event in the last 20 years has had some element of fakery in it, and they've gotten away with it.
[03:27:37.604 --> 03:27:39.425]  You know, so I guess they can fake anything.
[03:27:39.425 --> 03:27:41.487]  But anyway, that's Dr. Greer's theory.
[03:27:41.487 --> 03:27:56.757]  The point is that something very big is about to happen, and that's why the censorship has moved into such a stage of desperation, because they have to eliminate humanity, but they have to create a narrative and control the narrative before they unleash the things that are going to happen.
[03:27:57.598 --> 03:28:06.746]  I think they also are working very hard to try to get somebody to call for violence who's a conservative.
[03:28:06.746 --> 03:28:13.331]  They want to see conservatives calling for violence, you know, kind of snapping and calling for violence, which we never do.
[03:28:13.331 --> 03:28:14.833]  We always say no violence.
[03:28:14.833 --> 03:28:17.094]  We have to do this through a peaceful process.
[03:28:17.094 --> 03:28:20.057]  We have to support our president, our commander-in-chief.
[03:28:20.057 --> 03:28:23.280]  Now, I've called for the president to arrest
[03:28:24.140 --> 03:28:39.486]  These tech giant CEOs of the tech giants, but we never call for individual vigilante violence But that's what the leftists want to see even though that's their plan to unleash that on us Well, I'll have much more on that straight ahead when we return here on the Alex Jones Show stay with us
[03:28:53.246 --> 03:28:55.468]  Okay, so a watch is good, and some jewelry.
[03:28:55.468 --> 03:28:56.730]  Better grab some flowers, too.
[03:28:56.730 --> 03:28:57.330]  Hey, whatcha doing?
[03:28:57.330 --> 03:28:58.832]  Ah, Mother's Day, remember?

[03:31:48.244 --> 03:31:53.786]  Now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:31:53.786 --> 03:31:59.549]  You know, the worst part about getting old, and I'm still strong at 45, is that I won't be there for my children someday.
[03:31:59.549 --> 03:32:01.009]  So I need to make them strong now.
[03:32:01.009 --> 03:32:02.770]  Now, I can be there for my children.
[03:32:02.770 --> 03:32:04.611]  Now, I can make them strong.
[03:32:04.611 --> 03:32:06.252]  Now, I can instruct them.
[03:32:06.252 --> 03:32:07.973]  Now, I can teach them what I've learned.
[03:32:07.973 --> 03:32:08.973]  But not once I'm gone.
[03:32:09.073 --> 03:32:14.196]  You think in this digital age, your word's gone forever, but now they're even better at getting rid of what you said they were before.
[03:32:14.196 --> 03:32:19.799]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book burning, isn't it?
[03:32:19.799 --> 03:32:23.441]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[03:32:23.441 --> 03:32:28.403]  I can't be destroyed now, as long as I realize I've done right and as long as the people know the truth.
[03:32:28.403 --> 03:32:35.227]  And you can't be destroyed either, as long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it and go through the fire for it.
[03:32:35.287 --> 03:32:39.069]  There is a magic that then takes place that transcends space and time.
[03:32:39.069 --> 03:32:46.714]  When you commit via word of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread our articles and videos, that overrides everything the enemy's doing.
[03:32:46.714 --> 03:32:57.780]  So please now, commit to support InfoWars however you can, and realize your provision to InfoWars is your own provision.
[03:32:57.780 --> 03:33:00.382]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:13.365 --> 03:33:18.949]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:18.949 --> 03:33:22.231]  And now, your host, Mike Adams.
[03:33:23.928 --> 03:33:30.151]  If you listen to InfoWars or watch InfoWars every day, it's very easy to take this for granted.
[03:33:30.151 --> 03:33:34.033]  And to take for granted the fight that Alex Jones is in.
[03:33:34.033 --> 03:33:35.534]  And the fight that all of us are in.
[03:33:35.534 --> 03:33:36.535]  The fight of our lives.
[03:33:36.535 --> 03:33:38.136]  The fight for human freedom.
[03:33:38.136 --> 03:33:40.477]  For your right to speak, not just our own right to speak.
[03:33:41.938 --> 03:33:52.923]  I just want to say on the record, you know, we are blessed, humanity is blessed to have a fighter like Alex Jones, who is willing to stand up against all these vicious attacks.
[03:33:52.923 --> 03:33:56.245]  And believe me, he hasn't even told you the half of it.
[03:33:56.245 --> 03:34:01.447]  He hasn't even told me the half of it, and he's probably told me maybe more than he's mentioned publicly.
[03:34:01.447 --> 03:34:03.388]  And of course, I have attacks on me as well.
[03:34:03.388 --> 03:34:09.191]  But I'll just tell you the things we know behind the scenes are so outrageous, you would not even believe them.
[03:34:10.120 --> 03:34:19.167]  And maybe someday it'll all come out if Alex chooses to share more, but that'll only happen probably after we defeat the Globalists.
[03:34:19.167 --> 03:34:24.690]  And then I think Alex Jones will go down in history as a champion of human freedom.
[03:34:24.690 --> 03:34:28.353]  Don't take this for granted, the fact that Infowars is here.
[03:34:28.353 --> 03:34:34.317]  If Alex were any less of a fighter, if he were a weak person, Infowars would have been defeated long ago.
[03:34:34.317 --> 03:34:35.658]  No question about it.
[03:34:35.658 --> 03:34:37.840]  And people like Paul Joseph Watson are really
[03:34:38.656 --> 03:34:39.977]  Treasures for humanity.
[03:34:39.977 --> 03:34:41.999]  It's not an exaggeration.
[03:34:41.999 --> 03:34:53.587]  Paul Joseph Watson being willing to speak out and standing up against the censorship and the attacks and now being labeled essentially a dangerous international terrorist, if you can believe that.
[03:34:53.587 --> 03:34:57.670]  I mean, President Trump just gave the Medal of Freedom to a golfer.
[03:34:59.524 --> 03:35:10.414]  I hope that one day President Trump might consider giving the Medal of Freedom to some of these champions of independent media who have really stood up against tyranny.
[03:35:10.414 --> 03:35:11.935]  Your support is absolutely crucial.
[03:35:11.935 --> 03:35:13.997]  Do not take this platform for granted.
[03:35:13.997 --> 03:35:17.560]  It's your purchases that keep this place alive.
[03:35:17.560 --> 03:35:19.362]  I'm a food scientist.
[03:35:19.362 --> 03:35:20.743]  I'm a nutritional supplement scientist.
[03:35:20.743 --> 03:35:21.364]  I run a lab.
[03:35:22.029 --> 03:35:25.732]  I saw Infowars has a sale today on their B12 formula.
[03:35:25.732 --> 03:35:26.452]  It's a new formula.
[03:35:26.452 --> 03:35:28.473]  It's got double the B12.
[03:35:28.473 --> 03:35:32.856]  5,000 micrograms of the methylcobalamin form of B12.
[03:35:32.856 --> 03:35:44.484]  And I have to say, as a formulator and a scientist, you will absolutely not find a better deal on this form of B12 from anybody, anywhere.
[03:35:45.265 --> 03:35:48.366]  In fact, we couldn't sell it for this low.
[03:35:48.366 --> 03:35:50.606]  We'd probably lose money if we tried to sell it for this low.
[03:35:50.606 --> 03:35:52.367]  I don't know how he gets that good of a deal.
[03:35:52.367 --> 03:36:00.909]  Do you realize that that key ingredient, methylcobalamin, if I recall, the raw material of that in powder form, I think it costs $12,000 a kilo.
[03:36:00.909 --> 03:36:09.751]  Yeah, some of these raw materials are more expensive than, you know, the most insane substance that you can think of.
[03:36:09.751 --> 03:36:12.832]  I mean, the cost of this is incredible.
[03:36:13.413 --> 03:36:17.155]  Because it's the bioavailable form of B12.
[03:36:17.155 --> 03:36:28.441]  There's other supplements, cheaper supplements that say they have B12, but they use what's called cyanocobalamin, which is a cyanide molecule combined with the cobalamin portion of the molecule.
[03:36:28.441 --> 03:36:29.462]  And it's not nearly as effective.
[03:36:30.382 --> 03:36:31.042]  And it's dirt cheap.
[03:36:31.042 --> 03:36:36.746]  It's just a few hundred dollars a kilo versus I think it's over $12,000 a kilo for the methylcobalamin.
[03:36:36.746 --> 03:36:45.771]  So you're getting like ultra premium ingredients in huge functional doses at crazy discounted prices.
[03:36:45.771 --> 03:36:53.295]  Even I, as someone who runs an entire nutritional supplement organization, I'm just astonished at what InfoWars is able to put together.
[03:36:53.295 --> 03:36:57.257]  They must have got the best deal ever, ever seen in the industry.
[03:36:57.257 --> 03:36:58.938]  And if you get the auto ship on that,
[03:36:59.638 --> 03:37:00.618]  It's another 10% off.
[03:37:00.618 --> 03:37:03.139]  I think it's like $22 and something for a bottle.
[03:37:03.139 --> 03:37:06.600]  So check it out at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:37:06.600 --> 03:37:09.421]  Support your health and support this organization.
[03:37:09.421 --> 03:37:15.142]  Without Alex Jones, you know, we don't have this platform to fight for human freedom.
[03:37:15.142 --> 03:37:15.943]  And I agree with Alex.
[03:37:15.943 --> 03:37:17.303]  I think we're going to win.
[03:37:17.303 --> 03:37:22.725]  But we're going to have to go through sheer hell, I think, to get there.
[03:37:22.725 --> 03:37:24.845]  Because the battle is on.
[03:37:24.845 --> 03:37:26.566]  Now, we've been here before.
[03:37:26.566 --> 03:37:27.826]  The human race has been here before.
[03:37:28.590 --> 03:37:30.512]  We saw the rise of the Third Reich.
[03:37:30.512 --> 03:37:33.554]  We saw fascism take over.
[03:37:33.554 --> 03:37:48.207]  And what's interesting about what's happening in the left today, the leftists, the Antifa people, the left-wing media, the journo-terrorists, they are whipping up hatred in the same way that the Third Reich whipped up hatred against the enemies of Adolf Hitler.
[03:37:49.289 --> 03:37:58.336]  You know, before they could carry out the Holocaust, they had to create and invoke all of this hatred of their political enemies, their targeted enemies.
[03:37:58.336 --> 03:38:01.758]  That's exactly what social media is doing today.
[03:38:01.758 --> 03:38:03.880]  It's exactly what CNN is doing today.
[03:38:03.880 --> 03:38:06.762]  CNN is a factory of hate.
[03:38:06.762 --> 03:38:12.286]  And of course, they label everything that they want to censor, hate speech, while they are pushing hatred
[03:38:13.018 --> 03:38:13.518]  Every day.
[03:38:13.518 --> 03:38:14.639]  They are pushing bigotry.
[03:38:14.639 --> 03:38:15.780]  They are pushing intolerance.
[03:38:15.780 --> 03:38:18.161]  They are, in essence, advocating violence.
[03:38:18.161 --> 03:38:19.542]  Even Facebook.
[03:38:19.542 --> 03:38:23.024]  You know, they'll ban Paul Joseph Watson, but do they ban...
[03:38:24.045 --> 03:38:28.947]  Channels that actually openly advocate, let's say, radical Islamic terrorism?
[03:38:28.947 --> 03:38:29.587]  No.
[03:38:29.587 --> 03:38:30.287]  Often they don't.
[03:38:30.287 --> 03:38:32.848]  Maybe in a few cases they have, but often they don't.
[03:38:32.848 --> 03:38:37.010]  Do they ban the channels that call for the murder and execution of President Trump?
[03:38:37.010 --> 03:38:37.390]  No.
[03:38:37.390 --> 03:38:41.852]  They don't ban those channels because that's the hatred that they want to spread.
[03:38:41.852 --> 03:38:43.332]  That's who they are.
[03:38:43.332 --> 03:38:47.954]  All of these tech, these big tech organizations, they are at war with humanity.
[03:38:49.005 --> 03:38:52.926]  Now, let me address something that I've been criticized on about this.
[03:38:52.926 --> 03:39:01.668]  I have said that President Trump needs to use the power of government to go to war with these tech companies to arrest their CEOs and shut them down.
[03:39:01.668 --> 03:39:02.508]  That's what I've said.
[03:39:02.508 --> 03:39:03.328]  That's my view.
[03:39:03.328 --> 03:39:05.548]  That's not the official InfoWars view.
[03:39:05.548 --> 03:39:06.709]  Alex hasn't said that.
[03:39:06.709 --> 03:39:08.169]  That's me saying that.
[03:39:08.169 --> 03:39:13.190]  Some people have said, well, why would you want government to decide which corporations are allowed to operate?
[03:39:13.190 --> 03:39:13.890]  No, you don't understand.
[03:39:14.884 --> 03:39:29.408]  Every institution in society is at war against humanity and human freedom, including the left-wing governments, the left-wing deep state, the bureaucracy, the corporations, the education institutions, you know, the Hollywood media, everything.
[03:39:29.408 --> 03:39:31.648]  Everything is at war with humanity.
[03:39:31.648 --> 03:39:38.290]  And for this very short period of time, this short window, we have elected President Trump.
[03:39:38.290 --> 03:39:42.431]  He's in control of some small portion of the federal government.
[03:39:43.027 --> 03:39:46.569]  He must use what we control now.
[03:39:46.569 --> 03:39:50.312]  He must weaponize... That's not the right word.
[03:39:50.312 --> 03:40:03.301]  He must stop the weaponization of social media against us by using the power of government to defend humanity against this weaponization of speech that has been carried out by the social media giants.
[03:40:03.954 --> 03:40:12.002]  So, in other words, government uses coercion to stop people, government uses coercion to stop criminals, government uses coercion to stop corporations sometimes.
[03:40:12.002 --> 03:40:14.544]  It's time to use that power while we have it.
[03:40:14.544 --> 03:40:20.230]  Because we're never going to have it again if we don't defeat these tyrants, these techno-fascists, right now.
[03:40:20.230 --> 03:40:21.972]  It's like if you were fighting in World War II,
[03:40:23.127 --> 03:40:37.177]  And you're trying to defeat Adolf Hitler and you have your American soldiers, you break through the Axis front lines and you go in and you seize the artillery of the German soldiers, maybe some of their 88 flak guns or something.
[03:40:37.177 --> 03:40:39.159]  You seize German artillery.
[03:40:39.159 --> 03:40:44.302]  Are you going to sit there and tell me that you shouldn't use their artillery against them?
[03:40:44.302 --> 03:40:50.046]  That you shouldn't turn that artillery around and fire those artillery rounds at Adolf Hitler's bunker?
[03:40:50.046 --> 03:40:50.807]  Of course you should.
[03:40:51.559 --> 03:40:53.961]  Trump should seize the moment.
[03:40:53.961 --> 03:41:05.511]  He should take the power that he has, a very limited window, and he should metaphorically fire the artillery, again a metaphor, not an actual physical artillery, at these tech giants.
[03:41:05.511 --> 03:41:07.493]  He should do it through regulatory control.
[03:41:07.493 --> 03:41:09.815]  He could do it through legal action.
[03:41:09.815 --> 03:41:13.899]  These companies have engaged in clear violations of RICO Act racketeering.
[03:41:14.474 --> 03:41:16.115]  They have engaged in massive fraud.
[03:41:16.115 --> 03:41:18.657]  They have engaged in human rights violations.
[03:41:18.657 --> 03:41:20.918]  They are guilty on so many levels.
[03:41:20.918 --> 03:41:35.408]  They could easily be investigated, indicted, perhaps shut down, or perhaps forced to sign a consent decree that simply says they will no longer violate the rights of American citizens, the basic human dignity rights.
[03:41:35.408 --> 03:41:40.331]  And if you think that these companies have the right to do whatever they want, I'll ask you this.
[03:41:40.331 --> 03:41:43.793]  What if Mark Zuckerberg suddenly became a conservative overnight
[03:41:44.804 --> 03:41:48.005]  No, what if he became, let's go in front, what if he became a racist bigot?
[03:41:48.005 --> 03:41:55.268]  What if Mark Zuckerberg announced that, that just as a bizarre example, that no black people were allowed to use Facebook?
[03:41:55.268 --> 03:41:58.089]  If he announced that, how insane would that be?
[03:41:58.089 --> 03:41:59.950]  How bigoted would that be?
[03:41:59.950 --> 03:42:04.111]  But according to so many people out there, oh, it's a private company, they can do whatever they want to do.
[03:42:04.111 --> 03:42:04.712]  Really?
[03:42:04.712 --> 03:42:07.813]  What if they announced that no gay people can post on Facebook?
[03:42:07.813 --> 03:42:11.594]  How big of an outcry would there be?
[03:42:11.594 --> 03:42:12.795]  Because that's wrong.
[03:42:12.795 --> 03:42:13.435]  Every human,
[03:42:14.207 --> 03:42:18.951]  No matter the color of your skin, no matter your sexual orientation, no matter your religion, every human has a right to speak.
[03:42:18.951 --> 03:42:28.618]  But Facebook is banning conservatives, and Facebook is banning Christians, and Facebook is banning Trump supporters, and gun owners, and people who believe in the Constitution, defending our borders.
[03:42:28.618 --> 03:42:30.079]  Why is that okay?
[03:42:30.079 --> 03:42:31.420]  It's not okay.
[03:42:31.420 --> 03:42:41.668]  It is time for Trump to unleash the full power of government that he currently controls to stop the censorship of humanity by evil techno-fascists.
[03:42:41.668 --> 03:42:43.510]  We'll be back with more after this break.
[03:42:43.510 --> 03:42:43.830]  Stay with us.
[03:42:53.266 --> 03:42:58.467]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[03:42:58.467 --> 03:43:07.029]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[03:43:07.029 --> 03:43:10.009]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[03:43:10.009 --> 03:43:11.749]  How can I solve that problem?
[03:43:11.749 --> 03:43:18.011]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[03:43:20.111 --> 03:43:25.454]  The Alexa Pure Breeze Groundbreaking Ion Cluster Air Filter Technology.
[03:43:25.454 --> 03:43:28.396]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[03:43:28.396 --> 03:43:32.338]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[03:43:32.338 --> 03:43:36.300]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[03:43:36.300 --> 03:43:38.141]  I've got two in my home.
[03:43:38.141 --> 03:43:44.244]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[03:43:44.244 --> 03:43:45.065]  Don't live
[03:43:45.905 --> 03:43:49.970]  In a polluted major city, in your home, have clean air.
[03:43:49.970 --> 03:43:51.212]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[03:43:53.246 --> 03:43:57.368]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[03:43:57.368 --> 03:44:04.431]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.

[03:44:54.677 --> 03:44:59.259]  Stacey in the great state of Texas in FEMA Region 6.
[03:44:59.259 --> 03:45:01.280]  You're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[03:45:01.280 --> 03:45:02.381]  Good to talk to you.
[03:45:02.381 --> 03:45:07.023]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[03:45:07.023 --> 03:45:08.964]  I was turned on to the ultimate female force.
[03:45:08.964 --> 03:45:13.506]  I looked at all the ingredients and they're all organic, root, things like that, that I trust.
[03:45:13.806 --> 03:45:19.772]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins that don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural.
[03:45:19.772 --> 03:45:20.572]  I appreciate that.
[03:45:20.572 --> 03:45:22.154]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[03:45:22.154 --> 03:45:22.754]  Tell us about it.
[03:45:22.754 --> 03:45:23.535]  Well, it's really great.
[03:45:23.535 --> 03:45:24.816]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[03:45:24.816 --> 03:45:25.337]  I take it.
[03:45:25.337 --> 03:45:26.077]  It tastes good.
[03:45:26.077 --> 03:45:27.939]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[03:45:27.939 --> 03:45:29.901]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[03:45:29.901 --> 03:45:33.364]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day, so I really like it.
[03:45:33.404 --> 03:45:36.228]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[03:45:36.228 --> 03:45:37.990]  They're known to turbocharge women.
[03:45:37.990 --> 03:45:40.053]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[03:45:40.053 --> 03:45:40.974]  So, yeah.
[03:45:40.974 --> 03:45:43.417]  Stamina, libido, energy.
[03:45:43.417 --> 03:45:46.241]  These are amazing things in ultimate female force.
[03:45:46.241 --> 03:45:47.402]  So I'm glad you plugged it.
[03:45:47.402 --> 03:45:49.204]  Infowarscore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:46:03.328 --> 03:46:12.351]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[03:46:12.351 --> 03:46:22.413]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[03:46:22.413 --> 03:46:30.956]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[03:46:31.776 --> 03:46:33.137]  There's nothing else like it.
[03:46:33.137 --> 03:46:34.297]  You must experience it.
[03:46:34.297 --> 03:46:36.278]  It is a total game changer.
[03:46:36.278 --> 03:46:41.300]  And it comes in easy to use packets to mix it with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[03:46:41.300 --> 03:46:42.821]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[03:46:42.821 --> 03:46:44.282]  It lasts 10 hours.
[03:46:44.282 --> 03:46:50.985]  So take a half pack the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[03:46:50.985 --> 03:46:57.267]  TurboForce at m4slife.com.
[03:46:57.267 --> 03:46:59.948]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:13.283 --> 03:47:16.566]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[03:47:16.566 --> 03:47:21.391]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Mike Adams.
[03:47:21.391 --> 03:47:30.701]  You know if you think about it, censorship that we're seeing now is really thought bubble reinforcement by the deranged lunatic left.
[03:47:30.701 --> 03:47:32.943]  They're living in an imaginary world.
[03:47:33.553 --> 03:47:49.321]  But because that imaginary world that's based on pure fiction and not facts, because it's reinforced so frequently through their own sources and through the censorship of any competing facts, well, they can continue to live in that delusional thought bubble.
[03:47:49.321 --> 03:47:52.462]  They get away with it and their friends will reinforce their delusions.
[03:47:52.462 --> 03:47:59.766]  Like there are still people, a big number of people in America who think that Putin put Trump, you know, somehow into the White House.
[03:47:59.766 --> 03:48:01.486]  They think that Trump committed treason.
[03:48:01.486 --> 03:48:02.647]  They think the Mueller report
[03:48:03.485 --> 03:48:06.867]  Somehow names Trump as carrying out treason.
[03:48:06.867 --> 03:48:11.429]  They believe this because this is what they've been told and what's been reported in the fake news media.
[03:48:11.429 --> 03:48:19.433]  And then you have Wikipedia that comes along and then reinforces all the false quote facts and bans any independent media sources.
[03:48:19.433 --> 03:48:22.234]  Even Breitbart is banned from Wikipedia.
[03:48:22.234 --> 03:48:24.215]  You can't cite Breitbart as a source.
[03:48:24.215 --> 03:48:26.796]  And now Facebook is going to start suppressing websites.
[03:48:26.796 --> 03:48:27.857]  This is the click gap.
[03:48:28.497 --> 03:48:30.158]  A new tool that they're going to use.
[03:48:30.158 --> 03:48:30.959]  It's a scheme.
[03:48:30.959 --> 03:48:36.962]  They're going to start suppressing websites that don't get cited by Wikipedia.
[03:48:36.962 --> 03:48:42.065]  But Wikipedia's rules don't allow anybody to cite a source that's the independent media.
[03:48:42.065 --> 03:48:43.506]  So it's just a circular logic.
[03:48:43.506 --> 03:48:45.767]  And it's all this delusional thought bubble.
[03:48:45.767 --> 03:48:47.568]  And this is what they're trying to do.
[03:48:47.568 --> 03:48:50.209]  To keep everybody trapped in that.
[03:48:50.209 --> 03:48:54.692]  What they can't allow humanity to do is escape the mental prison.
[03:48:55.515 --> 03:48:58.919]  Escape the mental prison and see a different source, see a different view.
[03:48:58.919 --> 03:49:04.285]  Have actual facts that challenge the establishment.
[03:49:04.285 --> 03:49:05.326]  And it's on every issue.
[03:49:05.326 --> 03:49:12.294]  It's not just politics, it's about finance, it's about science and medicine, vaccines, GMOs, pesticides.
[03:49:12.294 --> 03:49:17.019]  If you have a competing view that contradicts or challenges the establishment,
[03:49:17.685 --> 03:49:30.395]  Then you have to be suppressed, and not only will you be suppressed, you will be, of course, vilified, defamed, lied about, probably criminalized, labeled a terrorist, which seems to be what's happened to Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:49:30.395 --> 03:49:36.459]  And this is why it's so crucial to look at the alternative media sources that are out there.
[03:49:36.459 --> 03:49:45.266]  Not only is Infowars.com, you know, one of the top media sources, and, you know, my sites, Natural News and others, you've also got News Wars out there.
[03:49:45.908 --> 03:49:48.951]  We've got different news aggregation websites that are cropping up right now.
[03:49:48.951 --> 03:49:52.175]  I've been running censored.news for quite some time.
[03:49:52.175 --> 03:49:53.796]  Which is an excellent site.
[03:49:53.796 --> 03:49:55.478]  Mike Adams of naturalnews.com.
[03:49:55.478 --> 03:49:58.321]  I'm breaking in with huge news.
[03:49:58.321 --> 03:49:59.522]  I was in the kitchen.
[03:50:00.603 --> 03:50:05.224]  Eating lunch, watching you and actually taking notes and going over some things.
[03:50:05.224 --> 03:50:09.466]  And then Kellan McBrain walked in and he said, here's the article you asked for two days ago.
[03:50:09.466 --> 03:50:10.666]  It took me two days.
[03:50:10.666 --> 03:50:18.728]  He goes, here's examples of every Democrat candidate for president saying we'll confiscate all semi-autos and SWAT team their homes if they don't.
[03:50:18.728 --> 03:50:20.589]  So that article is on Infowars.com.
[03:50:20.589 --> 03:50:23.429]  I'll cover that obviously tomorrow and come up the war room.
[03:50:23.429 --> 03:50:24.630]  But here's the even bigger news.
[03:50:25.710 --> 03:50:30.332]  Again, there's the article proof every single dim candidate is a danger to the Second Amendment.
[03:50:30.332 --> 03:50:36.655]  Quotes from each individual show their hatred for the Constitution and American rights and their admission they want to confiscate the guns.
[03:50:36.655 --> 03:50:37.695]  They want a civil war.
[03:50:37.695 --> 03:50:38.976]  But here's the big news.
[03:50:38.976 --> 03:50:39.836]  Caitlin Bennett
[03:50:40.834 --> 03:50:46.039]  With her out-of-the-park videos that have been so incredible, she's done it beyond anything anyone's seen.
[03:50:46.039 --> 03:50:49.842]  This is coming up on The War Room in 10 minutes with Owen Schroeder.
[03:50:49.842 --> 03:50:52.244]  He'll air the whole thing, she'll be on, you name it.
[03:50:52.244 --> 03:50:57.049]  Must guilty white college students pay reparations to black men.
[03:50:57.049 --> 03:51:03.755]  And again, this shows the mind control that people are under at universities, even when he's wearing a mega hat.
[03:51:03.755 --> 03:51:05.817]  Here's just a few seconds of it, then back to Mike Adams.
[03:51:07.503 --> 03:51:12.046]  We're here at Youngstown State University today with Joel Patrick.
[03:51:12.046 --> 03:51:20.732]  And I'm here asking people if they will pay me some reparations.
[03:51:20.732 --> 03:51:24.635]  Reparations.
[03:51:24.635 --> 03:51:27.797]  Do you support reparations for black people because of slavery?
[03:51:27.797 --> 03:51:31.360]  To some extent, yes.
[03:51:32.097 --> 03:51:32.658]  What about you?
[03:51:32.658 --> 03:51:33.639]  Do you support?
[03:51:33.639 --> 03:51:34.599]  Definitely?
[03:51:34.599 --> 03:51:35.000]  Perfect!
[03:51:35.000 --> 03:51:36.161]  So we have Joel over here.
[03:51:36.161 --> 03:51:36.781]  Joel Patrick.
[03:51:36.781 --> 03:51:38.723]  He is a reparation jar.
[03:51:38.723 --> 03:51:41.586]  You guys have the chance to pay him for your crimes.
[03:51:41.586 --> 03:51:44.488]  I just gave him ten bucks to pick up my pants.
[03:51:44.488 --> 03:51:45.729]  Ten dollars?
[03:51:45.729 --> 03:51:46.550]  Alright, here we go.
[03:51:46.550 --> 03:51:49.293]  Grown men are going to get out their wallets to pay for slavery.
[03:51:49.293 --> 03:51:49.713]  Alright.
[03:51:55.911 --> 03:51:57.773]  So this is the Mind Control.
[03:51:57.773 --> 03:51:59.334]  Mike Adams, I'm going to turn this over to you.
[03:51:59.334 --> 03:52:03.559]  This video just went live on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:52:03.559 --> 03:52:04.800]  We're going to duplicate this at UT.
[03:52:04.800 --> 03:52:06.001]  I think the same thing will happen.
[03:52:06.001 --> 03:52:08.604]  But Caitlin Bennett and Millie Weaver and our crew is on Fuego.
[03:52:08.604 --> 03:52:11.727]  Thanks for hosting today and thanks for letting me pop in, Mike.
[03:52:11.727 --> 03:52:12.748]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:52:12.748 --> 03:52:16.011]  This is fascinating because it shows the actual programming, the Mind Control
[03:52:17.063 --> 03:52:24.925]  White people have been indoctrinated with a sense of white guilt to such an extent that they don't even believe that they themselves qualify as people anymore.
[03:52:24.925 --> 03:52:34.988]  I mean, this comes back to that Supreme Court decision that at one time decided that, what, black people, they said, were only five-eighths of a human.
[03:52:34.988 --> 03:52:42.610]  I wonder if white people today think they're only three-eighths of a human, because this is the level of brainwashing that it has come to.
[03:52:42.610 --> 03:52:43.190]  It's incredible!
[03:52:44.401 --> 03:53:00.116]  I think it's going to go so far where they could literally start telling young white millennials to line up, like in that Star Trek episode, line up to be killed in the death chamber so that they can run their simulated AI war scenario.
[03:53:00.116 --> 03:53:01.878]  Remember that original Star Trek episode?
[03:53:01.878 --> 03:53:02.539]  Oh, that was a great one.
[03:53:02.539 --> 03:53:07.303]  The AI said we used to have wars before, but now we have simulations that you just have to get in the chambers and die.
[03:53:08.035 --> 03:53:08.655]  That's right, right.
[03:53:08.655 --> 03:53:12.798]  So the deaths are real, but the war is a simulation, but people have to die.
[03:53:12.798 --> 03:53:13.919]  I mean, wow!
[03:53:13.919 --> 03:53:21.843]  And that was decades ago that that was written by Roddenberry, I believe, and now you're actually seeing that kind of white guilt come to play.
[03:53:21.843 --> 03:53:25.425]  Makes you wonder, do... You mentioned this, Alex, before.
[03:53:25.425 --> 03:53:36.612]  I hope you can still hang with me for four minutes here, but does humanity have the will to survive anymore, or has it become so weak and so pathetic that it's just a suicide cult?
[03:53:37.393 --> 03:53:51.838]  Oh, I mean, I went and saw this devil worship movie last night, Hell's Satan, and they rope you in like they're atheists, but they really are devil worshippers, and they're just so weak and pathetic, and you and I would watch that, you're a hard-working guy, I'm a hard-working guy, I don't say I'm Mr. Manly, but compared to them, we think that's pathetic.
[03:53:51.838 --> 03:53:55.999]  No, the left sees that, it sees it being glorified, and it's all over the news.
[03:53:55.999 --> 03:54:00.801]  The Democratic Party says our new operating system will be Satanism, so it's now official.
[03:54:02.236 --> 03:54:03.557]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[03:54:03.557 --> 03:54:09.239]  And you're seeing people programmed to love the murder of babies born alive.
[03:54:09.239 --> 03:54:12.001]  Infanticide is being embraced by the left.
[03:54:12.001 --> 03:54:20.765]  It's not just deplatforming people and depersoning human beings, but it's literally ripping their limbs apart in the womb.
[03:54:20.765 --> 03:54:24.947]  And CNN, a CNN guest, I think, declaring that an unborn baby is not even human.
[03:54:24.947 --> 03:54:25.948]  Oh yeah, we have that clip.
[03:54:25.948 --> 03:54:26.908]  Can we cue that up?
[03:54:26.908 --> 03:54:27.989]  And by the way, in the film,
[03:54:28.769 --> 03:54:36.094]  Uh, the whole club kid thing is, before they get pedophilia going mainline, they would have men dress up like babies in diapers and stuff, and then men would have sex with them.
[03:54:36.094 --> 03:54:40.137]  And they do that actually in satanic rituals as, as, you know, if they can't get real kids.
[03:54:40.137 --> 03:54:41.739]  That's done in this movie.
[03:54:41.739 --> 03:54:43.380]  And then they go, we're sick of babies.
[03:54:43.380 --> 03:54:44.140]  We don't like them.
[03:54:44.140 --> 03:54:45.241]  We're sick of unborn.
[03:54:45.241 --> 03:54:46.882]  We're sick of holding them on a pedestal.
[03:54:46.882 --> 03:54:48.564]  Piss on those babies.
[03:54:48.564 --> 03:54:51.206]  And, and, and, and, and, you know, the, the, uh,
[03:54:52.106 --> 03:54:56.068]  I can't say all the rest of the stuff, but the point is, is that it's truly pathetic.
[03:54:56.068 --> 03:55:00.771]  Here's that clip with him on CNN, and here's the representative down in Alabama or wherever.
[03:55:00.771 --> 03:55:03.932]  Here it is.
[03:55:03.932 --> 03:55:08.034]  All I'm saying to you, it ought to be a woman's choice.
[03:55:08.034 --> 03:55:14.098]  I'm not about to be able to tell a woman what to do with her body.
[03:55:14.098 --> 03:55:17.579]  She has a right to make that decision herself.
[03:55:17.579 --> 03:55:18.600]  Directly, he said.
[03:55:21.158 --> 03:55:23.862]  Some kids are unwanted.
[03:55:23.862 --> 03:55:26.746]  So you kill them now, I'll kill them later.
[03:55:26.746 --> 03:55:31.794]  You bring them anywhere, unwanted, unloved, you send them to the neck of the chair.
[03:55:31.794 --> 03:55:33.356]  So you kill them now, I'll kill them later.
[03:55:35.481 --> 03:55:39.505]  But the bottom line is, we should be making this decision.
[03:55:57.601 --> 03:56:03.285]  Ganging up on an old person or an infirm person or a baby, you get power because I get your resources.
[03:56:03.285 --> 03:56:10.970]  No, human society builds a lattice of complex civilization that builds niches for everyone to operate in, not one crop economies.
[03:56:10.970 --> 03:56:13.972]  So they're teaching us to think that when someone fails, we get ahead.
[03:56:13.972 --> 03:56:15.813]  That is not the true human system.
[03:56:15.813 --> 03:56:19.676]  We transcend the whole social Darwin system and build something more advanced.
[03:56:19.676 --> 03:56:23.619]  So the left removes actual competition to make us all strong.
[03:56:23.619 --> 03:56:27.101]  And then once they remove all competition, then they feed on us one group after another.
[03:56:27.261 --> 03:56:35.346]  Yeah, let's be clear here, Rick, with all of your distortions and horrible tales, I answered it numerous times.
[03:56:35.346 --> 03:56:40.949]  When a woman gets pregnant, that is not a human being inside of her.
[03:56:40.949 --> 03:56:44.951]  It's part of her body, and this is about a woman having a baby.
[03:56:45.311 --> 03:56:50.134]  Agency and control of her body and making decisions about her body.
[03:57:15.791 --> 03:57:17.192]  Alright.
[03:57:17.192 --> 03:57:19.053]  Close this out, naturalnews.com.
[03:57:19.053 --> 03:57:29.519]  Okay, well, and look, this is going to escalate to the point where they are first criminalizing sterilizations, and then they will call for mass sterilization.
[03:57:29.519 --> 03:57:31.159]  Alright, we got Skype going down there.
[03:57:31.159 --> 03:57:32.200]  Mike Adams, you're awesome.
[03:57:32.200 --> 03:57:33.340]  Join us again very, very soon.
[03:57:33.340 --> 03:57:38.563]  And I think what he's saying is they're going to criminalize saying a baby's alive, which they're already starting to say.
[03:57:38.563 --> 03:57:39.264]  It's hate speech.
[03:57:39.264 --> 03:57:40.404]  I saw that in the news.
[03:57:40.404 --> 03:57:41.705]  They say a baby is a human.
[03:57:44.096 --> 03:57:51.440]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman, and child that has supported this broadcast over the years and that has stood with us.
