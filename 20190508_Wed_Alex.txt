[00:00.000 --> 00:18.080]  It's Wednesday, May 8th, 2019, I'm Alex Jones, your host, and every broadcast quite frankly
[00:18.080 --> 00:22.320]  just gets more intense, more important than the last, with the quickening happening on
[00:22.320 --> 00:23.320]  this planet.
[00:23.320 --> 00:29.120]  Someone here with a special report is very key, and when we come back I'm going to do
[00:29.120 --> 00:34.240]  my best with the dizzying amount of news and information that's all incredibly vital
[00:34.240 --> 00:39.340]  to cover it all, but quite frankly as the show starts, I've been for hours this morning
[00:39.340 --> 00:43.760]  trying to figure out what I would say our top story is, and our top story isn't one
[00:43.760 --> 00:51.120]  particular article or development, our top story is that civilization is in crisis,
[00:51.120 --> 00:55.280]  humanity is in crisis, and the globalists, the anti-human forces are greasing the skids
[00:55.280 --> 00:56.280]  of that.
[00:56.280 --> 01:02.680]  But first let's go to this important report that needs to be seen, DOJ's upcoming bombshell
[01:02.680 --> 01:11.080]  report on Comey's illegal activities, has Obama freaking out, another Greg Rees report.
[01:11.080 --> 01:16.960]  Ten years out of law school, 36-year-old James Comey joined the Clinton administration and
[01:16.960 --> 01:21.840]  acted as deputy special counsel to the Senate Whitewater Committee during investigations
[01:21.840 --> 01:27.320]  for Whitewater, Filegate, and Chinagate, all of which the Clintons were let off the hook
[01:27.320 --> 01:28.320]  for.
[01:28.320 --> 01:35.040]  So it's no surprise that in July of 2016, Comey let Hillary off the hook again for violating
[01:35.040 --> 01:40.800]  federal law when she was caught using private servers for the transfer of classified material.
[01:40.800 --> 01:45.720]  Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of
[01:45.720 --> 01:51.080]  classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such
[01:51.080 --> 01:52.080]  a case.
[01:52.080 --> 01:57.400]  Two months later, at an Ohio rally, Trump expresses his distrust in James Comey and
[01:57.400 --> 01:58.400]  the DOJ.
[01:58.400 --> 02:06.120]  After the FBI and Department of Justice whitewashed Hillary Clinton's email crimes, they certainly
[02:06.120 --> 02:12.840]  cannot be trusted to quickly or impartially investigate Hillary Clinton's new crimes,
[02:12.840 --> 02:17.320]  which happen all the time.
[02:17.320 --> 02:23.320]  In this time, the unverified steel dossier was used in a FISA submission to spy on the
[02:23.320 --> 02:25.320]  newly elected administration.
[02:25.320 --> 02:31.640]  The United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court was established under the Foreign Intelligence
[02:31.640 --> 02:38.120]  Surveillance Act of 1978 to oversee requests for surveillance warrants against foreign spies
[02:38.120 --> 02:40.560]  inside the United States.
[02:40.560 --> 02:46.120]  NSA analyst Russ Teiss called it a kangaroo court with a rubber stamp, and there has been
[02:46.120 --> 02:49.920]  growing criticism of the FISA court since 9-11.
[02:49.920 --> 02:54.800]  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the FISA court.
[02:54.800 --> 02:59.440]  We do respect the Fourth Amendment in this country and we issue warrants based on suspicion,
[02:59.440 --> 03:06.120]  but sometimes these warrants have to be issued by secret courts so we don't alert the suspects
[03:06.120 --> 03:13.920]  we're spying on, and these court proceedings are classified, which means surprise, they
[03:13.920 --> 03:17.600]  don't appear in papers such as the New York Times.
[03:17.600 --> 03:23.160]  On May 9th of 2017, President Trump fires James Comey.
[03:23.160 --> 03:29.400]  Aloof and disgraced, James Comey begins a book tour and a strange habit of tweeting
[03:29.400 --> 03:33.080]  out reflective self-portraits.
[03:33.080 --> 03:39.920]  In January of 2018, InfoWars releases the secret FISA memo.
[03:39.920 --> 03:46.480]  In April of 2018, Comey comes under fire for leaking classified memos, and now that the
[03:46.480 --> 03:52.320]  Mueller witch hunt has ended, the tables are turning against Comey and the Deep State.
[03:52.320 --> 03:58.200]  There's another report that everybody has forgotten about involving James Comey alone.
[03:58.200 --> 04:00.200]  That will be out in two weeks.
[04:00.200 --> 04:03.360]  That report is going to be a bombshell.
[04:03.360 --> 04:07.440]  It's going to open up the investigation on a very high note, and there will be criminal
[04:07.440 --> 04:08.920]  referrals in it.
[04:08.920 --> 04:13.520]  James Comey, America's dirty cop, ate the soul of the FBI.
[04:13.520 --> 04:19.720]  He destroyed the FBI, and this little piece of paper, which is the FISA court ruling from
[04:19.720 --> 04:23.760]  2017, is going to be there undoing.
[04:23.760 --> 04:29.880]  The attempted coup against President Trump is not over, but James Comey may be the first
[04:29.880 --> 04:35.320]  domino to fall in what patriots hope to be the dismantling of America's criminal Deep
[04:35.320 --> 04:37.000]  State.
[04:37.000 --> 04:40.000]  For NewsWars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[04:40.000 --> 04:46.520]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, my head's spinning at this point, I don't know if that's
[04:46.520 --> 04:47.520]  the best job I can.
[04:47.520 --> 04:53.200]  I'm going to come back after this break to cover all this key information.
[04:53.200 --> 04:58.480]  I'm Alex Jones, NewsWars.com, the most banned sites in the world, only it's spread by word
[04:58.480 --> 05:00.360]  of mouth.
[05:00.360 --> 05:04.720]  InfoWars.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need,
[05:04.720 --> 05:10.840]  you don't want, the air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on
[05:10.840 --> 05:13.720]  par with a major city.
[05:13.720 --> 05:17.120]  There's some of the most polluted areas on earth, our major cities.
[05:17.120 --> 05:18.880]  How can I solve that problem?
[05:18.880 --> 05:27.160]  So we have air filters at InfoWars.com, the Elexapure Breeze, which is right now $50 off
[05:27.160 --> 05:32.600]  the Elexapure Breeze groundbreaking iron cluster air filter technology.
[05:32.600 --> 05:36.520]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now, we're basically selling these
[05:36.520 --> 05:39.440]  at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[05:39.440 --> 05:43.320]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[05:43.320 --> 05:48.920]  I've got two in my home, you will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the
[05:48.920 --> 05:51.560]  Elexapure Breeze in your house.
[05:51.560 --> 05:56.080]  Don't live in a polluted major city in your home.
[05:56.080 --> 05:57.080]  Have clean air.
[05:57.080 --> 06:24.760]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[06:24.760 --> 06:39.120]  Well, there's no doubt we were right, and it really wasn't too hard to be right if you
[06:39.120 --> 06:40.120]  studied history.
[06:40.120 --> 06:44.520]  Big tech and corrupt governments for decades have been building systems of total absolute
[06:44.520 --> 06:48.640]  surveillance and control.
[06:48.640 --> 06:53.400]  They are competitively rolling out the last decade devices in your homes that watch you
[06:53.400 --> 06:57.600]  and listen to you and track through every movement and then use that information against
[06:57.600 --> 07:03.600]  you in the marketplace to displace you and to create a post-human world where humans
[07:03.600 --> 07:05.280]  are obsolete.
[07:05.280 --> 07:13.920]  That is the Silicon Valley goal, Elon Musk and others, like the writer of the big article
[07:13.920 --> 07:22.200]  now almost 20 years ago, Why the Future Doesn't Need Us in Wired Magazine, Bill Joy, they've
[07:22.200 --> 07:23.520]  all told you this.
[07:23.520 --> 07:30.600]  This is a very cold-blooded, psychopathic, sociopathic, robotic movement pun intended
[07:30.600 --> 07:42.760]  against humanity, and of course now that's all just admitted, but the AI has trouble
[07:42.760 --> 07:50.160]  understanding humor, and so do a lot of these soulless globalists, and so when they sell
[07:50.160 --> 07:53.640]  you on the idea that they're just censoring nationalists or right-wingers than mixing
[07:53.640 --> 08:01.640]  us in with all sorts of unsavory groups like child kidnappers and murderers, they're just
[08:01.640 --> 08:05.880]  setting the precedent for everybody else, and I know you know that, but everyone needs
[08:05.880 --> 08:08.200]  to understand something.
[08:08.200 --> 08:13.080]  This is already being used to game markets, to consolidate control, to displace families
[08:13.080 --> 08:19.960]  and workers across the planet, and it's done so by design, and so it's been fundamentally
[08:19.960 --> 08:26.480]  built to be anti-human and abusive, and it was all built on denial of the surveillance
[08:26.480 --> 08:33.000]  when that was part of its basic infrastructure, and it was all built on the abuse of that
[08:33.000 --> 08:41.360]  information and abuse of that power toward now in the middle of 2019, already close to
[08:41.360 --> 08:52.760]  the middle of the year, already a good 40% in, we're being told that you can't send
[08:52.760 --> 08:59.760]  certain email links through your email, and that you can't say certain things over your
[08:59.760 --> 09:07.960]  digital phone, or that you can't have certain phone service if you are a conservative.
[09:07.960 --> 09:17.480]  This is so incredibly dangerous, it's so incredibly organized, it's so incredibly premeditated,
[09:17.480 --> 09:24.600]  and criminal, and it really is out of everything going on, the front and center issue.
[09:24.600 --> 09:30.800]  Now remember, a few months ago they passed a law in Europe that you can be given jail
[09:30.800 --> 09:36.760]  time for memes if you didn't get copyright authorization from the holders first.
[09:36.760 --> 09:42.800]  Well, if you mix together four or five images, it's a new transformative work in European
[09:42.800 --> 09:48.800]  law and US law and Japanese law, you name it, and you have a right if it's your free
[09:48.800 --> 09:54.680]  speech to do it, but they're saying no, we're going to use copyright to silence you even
[09:54.680 --> 09:59.360]  making a collage of images and try to put you in jail to scare you, that's their way
[09:59.360 --> 10:02.160]  of banning it.
[10:02.160 --> 10:06.960]  In the United States that still has some free speech, at least on paper, Instagram, now
[10:06.960 --> 10:12.440]  on my Facebook, to fact check and remove memes.
[10:12.440 --> 10:18.320]  So now they're saying if a meme isn't real, even though it's meant to be a joke, they're
[10:18.320 --> 10:24.440]  going to take a joke and then say, oh, it's a piece of news, and then if it isn't real,
[10:24.440 --> 10:25.440]  they're going to ban it.
[10:25.440 --> 10:35.080]  The famous meme that we turn into a t-shirt of Trump as a Greek champion with the severed
[10:35.080 --> 10:37.560]  head of Medusa that happens to be Hillary.
[10:37.560 --> 10:41.440]  Are they going to fact check that and say Trump really didn't sever Hillary's head?
[10:41.440 --> 10:47.640]  Hillary really isn't a Titan, Gorgon, Medusa?
[10:47.640 --> 10:52.960]  Or the new meme, are they going to fact check that and say, Jones is not a king penguin
[10:52.960 --> 10:58.200]  and Zuckerberg is not a giant lion seal, and he did not rape him.
[10:58.200 --> 11:07.680]  And Oliver Darcy and Brian Stelter, their heads weren't really on large albatrosses
[11:07.680 --> 11:12.120]  walking around watching the seal rape the penguin.
[11:12.120 --> 11:15.000]  That was a meme we put out that's pretty hilarious.
[11:15.000 --> 11:21.720]  Again, they're trying to make humor illegal, and then they play these mind games and go,
[11:21.720 --> 11:24.280]  oh, that didn't really happen.
[11:24.280 --> 11:29.080]  Remember when Carpe Dongtum put out the video that got like 100 million views last time
[11:29.080 --> 11:33.560]  I checked on three platforms of Joe Biden apologizing for groping everybody?
[11:33.560 --> 11:37.000]  And then the very same Joe Biden comes in behind him as a cutout and starts rubbing
[11:37.000 --> 11:38.200]  on him.
[11:38.200 --> 11:45.320]  Remember how the news said that that was fake, and it was a doctored video, ABC News, New
[11:45.320 --> 11:51.320]  York Times, CNN all said Trump tweeted a doctored fake video.
[11:51.320 --> 11:53.680]  No, it's called a joke.
[11:53.680 --> 11:57.680]  Everyone including a three-year-old would know it's like a cartoon, that it was Biden
[11:57.680 --> 12:02.400]  groping Biden, that that didn't really happen, that it's called humor.
[12:02.400 --> 12:08.600]  Again, PolitiFact, Washington Post, CNN, they all fact-checked Trump when he said, we've
[12:08.600 --> 12:17.200]  got burgers mile high here at the Oval Office when he talked to a TV camera.
[12:17.200 --> 12:23.840]  Remember that, and they said the president lied, the hamburgers only went up like 300
[12:23.840 --> 12:27.240]  feet if you stacked all the hamburgers.
[12:27.240 --> 12:32.200]  It's called hyperbole.
[12:32.200 --> 12:37.360]  They know that, but see, they're waging war on language now and common sense and then
[12:37.360 --> 12:42.160]  saying that's our excuse to take you down, because really the truth is just like ancient
[12:42.160 --> 12:47.720]  kings that were corrupt would find out if somebody was a jester in the town making fun
[12:47.720 --> 12:50.400]  of them, they'd kill you.
[12:50.400 --> 12:54.960]  And so what they're saying is, you're not allowed to make fun of us, you're not allowed
[12:54.960 --> 12:59.600]  to make jokes out of all this, because you've been politically beating us, and so we're
[12:59.600 --> 13:03.440]  going to accelerate all the control and all the oppression and all the surveillance we
[13:03.440 --> 13:04.440]  already had in place.
[13:04.440 --> 13:08.760]  We're just going to use it now a little bit earlier than we were because you're beating
[13:08.760 --> 13:11.960]  us, which is the good news.
[13:11.960 --> 13:15.080]  This is so criminal what they're doing, but no matter where you are in the world, this
[13:15.080 --> 13:16.480]  is being used against you.
[13:16.480 --> 13:20.360]  Again, in China, you can't sit on a Winnie the Pooh of any type.
[13:20.360 --> 13:24.960]  All services have filters that scan Winnie the Pooh images of any type.
[13:24.960 --> 13:29.360]  Winnie the Pooh is banned in China because people make fun of the leader, because in
[13:29.360 --> 13:35.320]  Chinese they think he sounds like Winnie the Pooh, and his nickname is Winnie the Pooh.
[13:35.320 --> 13:40.720]  Christopher Wabin, and again, Taiwanese emojis are banned inside China.
[13:40.720 --> 13:44.720]  For a few weeks, they were banned, period, on iPhones because Apple is based in China
[13:44.720 --> 13:49.880]  now and said, we'll ban that emoji of the Taiwanese flag, and again, maybe you don't
[13:49.880 --> 13:52.040]  care about Winnie the Pooh or the Taiwanese flag.
[13:52.040 --> 13:56.800]  The point is, these filters are in place, and now they're going to be used, and in America,
[13:56.800 --> 14:02.680]  they said the first man to be banned is Alex Jones, and his website, infowords.com, and
[14:02.680 --> 14:05.760]  now the letters started coming in today.
[14:05.760 --> 14:10.640]  I'm not at liberty to get to these yet, but we'll be announced in the next few days.
[14:10.640 --> 14:17.760]  The dangerous criminal Interpol G2 banking designation, so Paul's got the lawyers, he's
[14:17.760 --> 14:22.240]  filing today the first beginning of the suits, with the government on Facebook, I'm forced
[14:22.240 --> 14:27.600]  to, I mean, it's going to happen because it's coming where I won't be able to get a plane
[14:27.600 --> 14:28.600]  ticket.
[14:28.600 --> 14:34.000]  In fact, they're saying this, I am listed as a terrorist right now, and I told you this
[14:34.000 --> 14:38.960]  four months ago, we sent letters to G2, we sent letters to Interpol, we sent letters
[14:38.960 --> 14:43.960]  to the FBI, and just no response, but we have all the paperwork.
[14:43.960 --> 14:48.280]  Now Facebook, in the same order, now does banking, and then their press release in the
[14:48.280 --> 14:54.520]  same order as G2, and the FBI and Interpol, never been convicted, nothing.
[14:54.520 --> 15:01.120]  I am listed as an international arms dealer, an international terrorist, a child kidnapper,
[15:01.120 --> 15:04.480]  a child pornographer, this is what I'm listed as.
[15:04.480 --> 15:06.800]  I've never been convicted of any felony.
[15:06.800 --> 15:10.920]  I've been convicted of speeding, I mean, I've pled guilty to it, thank God, I haven't
[15:10.920 --> 15:15.560]  probably got a ticket in 10 years, I've got a ticket for failure signal ride or something
[15:15.560 --> 15:19.320]  I've been a few years ago, the point is, is that I'm not a kid, and I'm not a victim
[15:19.320 --> 15:22.520]  here folks, you're about to be victims.
[15:22.520 --> 15:29.320]  These people mean business, you understand, and they have hired all the SJWs everywhere
[15:29.320 --> 15:35.440]  to run MasterCard and run the big banks, and run everything, and Paul Joseph Watson got
[15:35.440 --> 15:39.400]  noticed today, we're not going to announce it yet, that he is officially a terrorist.
[15:39.400 --> 15:44.320]  That is going to have everything taken away from him, but he went to the UK government
[15:44.320 --> 15:49.160]  says they're ready to find Facebook, but see, the banks don't care, this is all the big
[15:49.160 --> 15:54.720]  banks in Facebook working together to crush and put conservatives and electronic gulags,
[15:54.720 --> 15:57.000]  hell electronic concentration camps.
[15:57.000 --> 16:03.280]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla, I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to
[16:03.280 --> 16:04.600]  seize my mother's house.
[16:04.600 --> 16:09.120]  I sued the IRS in one, I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[16:09.120 --> 16:12.400]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[16:12.400 --> 16:15.960]  tax problems they thought might never be solved, I can help you too.
[16:15.960 --> 16:20.080]  If you owe taxes, you can't pay, don't wait another day, there's no such thing as a hopeless
[16:20.080 --> 16:46.760]  tax case, call 834 no tax, or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.

[20:03.600 --> 20:22.160]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:22.160 --> 20:38.640]  Five from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[20:38.640 --> 20:41.840]  There's a one world government where you have a mark on your hand or your head to buy and
[20:41.840 --> 20:46.400]  sell, you must submit to the beast system, you must follow the social and religious orders
[20:46.400 --> 20:51.080]  of the world government, you must bow down and worship the image of the beast that is
[20:51.080 --> 20:58.080]  in all homes and all public places, described as a living 3D giant that is in the center
[20:58.080 --> 21:07.240]  of towns, that is an AI God that you are meant to submit to, and you're allowed to live and
[21:07.240 --> 21:10.880]  be part of the system, but you've got to agree to be sterilized, you've got to agree to not
[21:10.880 --> 21:15.600]  have children, only select people can do that, most of the children will be humanoid in the
[21:15.600 --> 21:21.760]  future, they will not actually be of a mother and father, that's all being announced in
[21:21.760 --> 21:28.640]  textbooks, babies are ugly, parasite cancers and national news everywhere, hails the new
[21:28.640 --> 21:35.200]  church of Satan as the new religion of America and opens up all these different offices across
[21:35.200 --> 21:44.480]  the country, it's a coming out of the evil, being poured out upon the land by the slaves
[21:44.480 --> 21:50.800]  of the system, and I'll be covering it all today, but the world government systems here,
[21:50.800 --> 21:57.360]  big tech is all basically coordinating the sensor and track and control, and now across
[21:57.360 --> 22:07.280]  the board with AI systems, Facebook, Instagram, Google, YouTube, Apple, they're all announcing,
[22:07.280 --> 22:15.280]  we're going to control what you can say and what you can do in live time with AI filters,
[22:15.280 --> 22:22.320]  and just as Matt Dredge warned years ago, we will then be herded into digital ghettos
[22:22.320 --> 22:29.240]  and then into physical ghettos, they're also announcing, Tamella Harris has given a speech,
[22:29.240 --> 22:36.720]  I've got it right here, one of the presidential candidates and a former vicious prosecutor,
[22:36.720 --> 22:42.800]  he has come out and said, we're going to ban people engaged in hate, that means criticism
[22:42.800 --> 22:47.880]  of her criminal activity, and that conservatism will be an act of domestic terrorism in the
[22:47.880 --> 22:53.520]  future, and that you will be locked up at the behest of her orders, and that's at her
[22:53.520 --> 23:02.480]  speech at the Detroit double ACP, in double ACP, Tamella Harris hints at government censorship
[23:02.480 --> 23:08.440]  of social media, no, that's not what she did, big league politics is great, but she didn't
[23:08.440 --> 23:13.880]  hint at it, she declared that conservatives will be listed as terrorists, and that they're
[23:13.880 --> 23:19.640]  going to strip big tech of their section 230 where they have immunity, well, they want
[23:19.640 --> 23:23.840]  to get rid of their own immunity, they want to be given new government super immunity
[23:23.840 --> 23:29.640]  to shut down whoever they want and then have immunity from that, just like vaccine makers
[23:29.640 --> 23:34.120]  have immunity from all the damage they cause, and there's no safety studies done, but you're
[23:34.120 --> 23:42.800]  just supposed to trust that, but don't forget, Instagram to fact check and remove memes,
[23:42.800 --> 23:47.640]  that's right, things that are funny, things that are jokes, oh, you mean Hillary really
[23:47.640 --> 23:55.960]  isn't, Medusa, oh, Snoop says that's a fake image, and you think I'm joking, that's what
[23:55.960 --> 24:01.560]  they're actually coming out and doing, and again, Trump didn't have mile highs burgers
[24:01.560 --> 24:06.840]  at the White House, Trump didn't have mile high burgers there, well, he lied to you,
[24:06.840 --> 24:11.040]  this is what they're doing, they tell you you're a liar, and go through every facet
[24:11.040 --> 24:17.280]  of your life watching what you do, what you say, indexing it all, and then restricting
[24:17.280 --> 24:23.200]  you on your social score, aka the black mirror, we read articles about the social score before
[24:23.200 --> 24:26.400]  black mirror, people say oh my god, they're building this off black mirror, no, black
[24:26.400 --> 24:33.760]  mirror was there to show you the future that was already in place in China, Twitter bans
[24:33.760 --> 24:38.840]  Jewish Trump supporter over AOC parody account, says parody on the account, says parody on
[24:38.840 --> 24:47.720]  the video, says satire, and it's really funny, and she's a public figure, but it's banned,
[24:47.720 --> 24:54.360]  we played it yesterday, but let's play a new, a new little meme piece that's out there
[24:54.360 --> 25:01.720]  on the web, it's Alex Jones, out there on Twitter, Alex Jones hacks Facebook, now obviously
[25:01.720 --> 25:06.440]  it's my voice, it's not Mark Zuckerberg, obviously we're not trying to deceive anyone, but if
[25:06.440 --> 25:10.320]  this gets picked up by the so-called mainstream news, because they're so deceptive, they will
[25:10.320 --> 25:16.520]  say somebody tried to deceive people and put words in Zuckerberg's mouth, because this
[25:16.520 --> 25:24.800]  is what they do, incredibly dangerous, I can't believe the users trust me they're a bunch
[25:24.800 --> 25:30.640]  of dumb efforts, and now he's going to tell you whose name you can say and what website
[25:30.640 --> 25:34.240]  you can share, oh it's a private company, yeah right, you're legally selling all your
[25:34.240 --> 25:37.840]  data, listening to you inside your house, giving all the data to the leftist groups
[25:37.840 --> 25:44.960]  to control you, no, it's criminal, organized, racketeering, and this is the system coming
[25:44.960 --> 25:49.720]  into place, it's our job to inform people, biblically it's going to come into place
[25:49.720 --> 25:55.200]  for one hour, and biblically one hour generally means in the type of ages they're talking
[25:55.200 --> 26:00.160]  about it, you have to get into the deep analysis of it, it's very, the profane can't understand
[26:00.160 --> 26:06.720]  it, it's like coded, it really gets deep, but there's different arguments, but one year
[26:06.720 --> 26:16.360]  generally means one day, one day means a year, and it depends on how you look at it, let's
[26:16.360 --> 26:24.680]  hope it's on a decade or 100 years, but the point is the devil's given power for one hour,
[26:24.680 --> 26:31.600]  one hour usually means a year, one day usually means 100 years, it's all open for interpretation
[26:31.600 --> 26:38.200]  but it means a limited time, a limited time, ladies and gentlemen, but you better buckle
[26:38.200 --> 26:42.640]  yourselves in because we're going to go into this, and you're going to see Satanism everywhere,
[26:42.640 --> 26:45.120]  they're going to be in your schools, they're going to be in private schools, they're going
[26:45.120 --> 26:47.760]  to be in your home schools, they're going to come to your house and arrest you and take
[26:47.760 --> 26:52.080]  your kids, they're coming, they're coming, they're coming, and it's all going to be
[26:52.080 --> 26:58.400]  called liberal and liberation, from the left it's free speech, but you won't have any
[26:58.400 --> 27:08.440]  speech, you won't have any speech, so pure evil is being poured out upon the world,
[27:08.440 --> 27:19.560]  so when we come back I'll get to this meme that just got put out, but it's absolutely
[27:19.560 --> 27:24.000]  amazing to watch all this unfold, oh and all these other activists and all these other
[27:24.000 --> 27:30.920]  writers and all these other people are being banned, and as soon as conservatives announce
[27:30.920 --> 27:35.200]  speaking tours, they're banned off their banking, they're banned off their Instagram, it's
[27:35.200 --> 27:42.160]  all coordinated, men rights activists, Rush V banned from Instagram, Chase Wee Pay after
[27:42.160 --> 27:49.920]  announcing US Speaking Tour after he was banned off of Amazon, and his books are just really
[27:49.920 --> 27:57.600]  pick up artists at confident type stuff, unbelievable ladies and gentlemen, but that's how all
[27:57.600 --> 28:04.480]  this works, remember when Hillary Clinton said Peppa the Frog was a white supremacist
[28:04.480 --> 28:09.080]  image because she didn't like memes, she saw it here and there and wanted to say he was
[28:09.080 --> 28:12.720]  a white supremacist too, you know Trump's a white supremacist, I'm a white supremacist,
[28:12.720 --> 28:16.040]  wouldn't you like to be a white supremacist too, I mean it's just on and on, and so she
[28:16.040 --> 28:23.880]  branded the frog as a white supremacist, so the supposed owner of it sued me so they
[28:23.880 --> 28:30.160]  could put in the news that I was a white supremacist, see how that works, and then it turns out
[28:30.160 --> 28:34.080]  he didn't even own the frog, oh and I'm not liberty to get to that, but ooh things didn't
[28:34.080 --> 28:40.480]  go too well, things haven't been going too well for Mr. Fury, what his lawyers told him,
[28:40.480 --> 28:48.640]  wow, shouldn't have told everybody that they could have the frog, shouldn't have told everybody,
[28:48.640 --> 28:55.280]  shouldn't have done that, oh and Big Bird, what about that, it's Big Bird yours too,
[28:55.280 --> 28:59.800]  wait till all that comes out, oh we're winning, the enemy's losing.

[31:19.120 --> 31:22.840]  trust, you know because I've seen a lot of other vitamins, they don't have things that
[31:22.840 --> 31:26.160]  they say that they have in them and they're often not things that are natural, I appreciate
[31:26.160 --> 31:27.160]  that.
[31:27.160 --> 31:28.640]  Well what happened with ultimate female force, tell us about it.

[33:21.280 --> 33:50.440]  Live, raw and unfiltered, it's the Alex Jones show, this is CNN.
[33:50.440 --> 33:56.360]  It's an incredibly big deal that Facebook is completely overhauling its mission and
[33:56.360 --> 34:00.400]  has a new mission, so what is the new mission of Facebook?
[34:00.400 --> 34:05.880]  Yeah, we're going to start censoring pro-Trump news or news we don't like, not even fake
[34:05.880 --> 34:06.880]  stuff, we're just going to censor it.
[34:06.880 --> 34:08.880]  So how exactly do you do that?
[34:08.880 --> 34:14.720]  I guess the message is to you, hey, it don't matter what's true, you keep your mouth shut
[34:14.720 --> 34:16.200]  or we're going to call you Hitler.
[34:16.200 --> 34:20.800]  Let me inside Mark Zuckerberg's head to like the moment that you decided you needed to
[34:20.800 --> 34:23.160]  change Facebook's core mission.
[34:23.160 --> 34:27.200]  Was there an event that happened or was there just a moment that you said we got to change
[34:27.200 --> 34:28.200]  something?
[34:28.200 --> 34:34.080]  No, Obama put an internet kill switch in place in 2010 and then signed a bill right before
[34:34.080 --> 34:40.680]  he left office saying that the CIA would be over the media and over the board of governors
[34:40.680 --> 34:41.680]  of the FCC.
[34:41.680 --> 34:46.560]  I mean, this is crazy stuff and it's in the news, it's not like I'm saying it.
[34:46.560 --> 34:50.320]  What have you had to kind of learn from the spread of misinformation or what have you
[34:50.320 --> 34:53.840]  learned to make sure that people can really connect?
[34:53.840 --> 34:59.040]  It's not in the news, but corporations send each other communications and they send stockholders
[34:59.040 --> 35:02.160]  information and everything's there, everything's there.
[35:02.160 --> 35:05.240]  I mean, you read the white papers today, it's like we're preparing for a post-human world
[35:05.240 --> 35:08.840]  and looking at the best way, do we just kill everybody right away with a virus or do we
[35:08.840 --> 35:13.400]  entertain them and then have them opt in to get more money up front to then have the
[35:13.400 --> 35:14.800]  government euthanize them later?
[35:14.800 --> 35:18.720]  And you keep hearing we've never been more divided, we've never been more polarized.
[35:18.720 --> 35:23.280]  Was it the political climate that led to kind of this awakening?
[35:23.280 --> 35:25.080]  Let me give you the big news right now.
[35:25.080 --> 35:27.560]  Let me tell everybody the big news right now.
[35:27.560 --> 35:33.200]  If you think 14-year-old and 12-year-old news about cameras and microphones watching
[35:33.200 --> 35:36.680]  and listening to you, you're like, oh, there's nothing about me that's interesting.
[35:36.680 --> 35:39.360]  It's like people put stuff on Facebook when they're going on a town where they live and
[35:39.360 --> 35:40.360]  people rob them.
[35:40.360 --> 35:41.720]  It's not that you did something wrong.
[35:41.720 --> 35:45.360]  You told folks what you had in your house, where you lived and where you were going for
[35:45.360 --> 35:46.360]  a week.
[35:46.360 --> 35:48.200]  Oh, you're going to Cancun for a week.
[35:48.200 --> 35:51.560]  You said where you lived and what you had in your house and showed off the stuff you
[35:51.560 --> 35:53.840]  had and then robbers robbed you.
[35:53.840 --> 35:54.840]  You're a dumbass.
[35:54.840 --> 35:57.080]  I don't say that meanly, it's true.
[35:57.080 --> 35:59.600]  Just like, oh, let the government know what I've got.
[35:59.600 --> 36:02.400]  I'm not at the time as if the government's full of angels.
[36:02.400 --> 36:07.000]  Samsung and all these companies for a decade have been telling you they're doing this because
[36:07.000 --> 36:12.400]  they're shelling the data on you and the intel on you into big algorithm systems.
[36:12.400 --> 36:13.400]  All right, folks.
[36:13.400 --> 36:14.400]  We're back live.
[36:14.400 --> 36:15.400]  Thank you for joining us.
[36:15.400 --> 36:16.400]  Here's what's happening.
[36:16.400 --> 36:40.200]  I don't even know if I continue on doing this show at this point.
[36:40.200 --> 36:44.400]  I think I may just get in the show right now because things are so bad in this country.
[36:44.400 --> 36:49.800]  I think talking about it is almost a way of just making it a form of entertainment.
[36:49.800 --> 36:53.560]  I mean, I really, really, really do.
[36:53.560 --> 36:57.240]  We have to do some really, really drastic things.
[36:57.240 --> 37:01.160]  If you see any of these tech executives in person, I wouldn't try to run them out of
[37:01.160 --> 37:02.160]  restaurants.
[37:02.160 --> 37:05.160]  I wouldn't try to do what the Democrats have said due to us that are fighting back against
[37:05.160 --> 37:06.160]  the bullying.
[37:06.160 --> 37:10.200]  But I would definitely let them know that you're aware of their criminal activity and
[37:10.200 --> 37:12.440]  that they will be brought to justice.
[37:12.440 --> 37:15.040]  And if you live next door to them, you should let them know that.
[37:15.040 --> 37:17.240]  If you run into them, you should.
[37:17.240 --> 37:21.600]  If you can do anything to hurt their stocks, if you can do anything to let these criminals
[37:21.600 --> 37:27.360]  know because they're consolidating power and it's getting worse by the day.
[37:27.360 --> 37:31.480]  And we just have a general population of people that are in La La Land in this country and
[37:31.480 --> 37:34.120]  worldwide from all the entertainment.
[37:34.120 --> 37:36.600]  People are drunk from entertainment.
[37:36.600 --> 37:39.240]  They're just drunk from stimuli.
[37:39.240 --> 37:42.080]  In fact, I've seen a bunch of big studies that are common sense, but studies that came
[37:42.080 --> 37:48.000]  out recently showing that seeing all the simulated sex and violence and just regular things on
[37:48.000 --> 37:55.320]  television destroys real memories, fake memories or memories of things that didn't happen
[37:55.320 --> 38:02.840]  are destroying our capacity to have any real memory about the real world or any real way
[38:02.840 --> 38:08.840]  to navigate the planet, to navigate what's happening on this actual world we live on.
[38:08.840 --> 38:12.680]  And again, all the metrics show that we're dying.
[38:12.680 --> 38:22.040]  Our IQs are lowering, our genetics are unraveling, our capacity to take action is faltering.
[38:22.040 --> 38:23.040]  We're dying.
[38:23.040 --> 38:24.840]  We're dying.
[38:24.840 --> 38:29.680]  And I went and saw a movie last night and it was exactly what I thought it would be and
[38:29.680 --> 38:40.280]  worse, so incredibly boring, so incredibly predictive, so pathetic, the people so weak
[38:40.280 --> 38:44.880]  and so soulless slaves.
[38:44.880 --> 38:47.080]  And it's exactly what I thought it would be.
[38:47.080 --> 38:51.040]  It's exactly what I knew it was, following it in the real world.
[38:51.040 --> 38:58.600]  And it was a giant PR rollout for Satanism and not for the fake atheistic Satanism where
[38:58.600 --> 39:04.280]  the atheists claim, oh, I'm really an atheist, oh, sure you are, yes, of course you are.
[39:04.280 --> 39:09.400]  These were actual devil-worse persons and by that they see themselves as the devil and
[39:09.400 --> 39:11.560]  you as their food.
[39:11.560 --> 39:17.080]  It's a predatory thing, do as thou wilt is the whole law and just thank God I'm not with
[39:17.080 --> 39:18.080]  those people.
[39:18.080 --> 39:22.680]  But being in the theater and looking at the weak chicken-neck people around me and watching
[39:22.680 --> 39:31.560]  their enjoyment was soul-sucking, like when you're in Los Angeles and feel the desperateness
[39:31.560 --> 39:36.800]  and the emptiness and the lostness and the movie is Hail Satan.
[39:36.800 --> 39:42.200]  I'm going to talk about it later in the broadcast, but I knew what was coming because I've been
[39:42.200 --> 39:43.200]  around these people.
[39:43.200 --> 39:49.880]  A lot of them were wearing Antifa T-shirts, basically Antifa, meth-methatic Antifa, super
[39:49.880 --> 39:55.920]  unhealthy, super depressed, super soulless, super third-weight, fourth-weight feminist,
[39:55.920 --> 40:04.800]  deep CIA demoralization operation and I was watching it and I just knew at some point
[40:04.800 --> 40:10.120]  they would say babies aren't human, babies are scum, babies in the womb suck and sure
[40:10.120 --> 40:13.840]  enough women are empowered, babies suck, babies aren't human.
[40:13.840 --> 40:19.560]  This thing that we revere inside of the mother, it's all we're liberal, we care, we care about
[40:19.560 --> 40:27.440]  children though and it's just all the bottom of the barrel of people that think they're
[40:27.440 --> 40:31.600]  going to give them power by the system if they destroy themselves and others around
[40:31.600 --> 40:34.040]  them.
[40:34.040 --> 40:38.240]  And then there's kind of set up against well-meaning Christians that still don't understand the
[40:38.240 --> 40:44.000]  full magnitude of what they're facing so I'll talk about that some later in the broadcast
[40:44.000 --> 40:56.080]  but sure enough I hadn't even done any searches yet, I hadn't done any searches yet for the
[40:56.080 --> 41:06.000]  stupid movie and when I looked it up it was all the same, 97% positive rating rotten tomato.
[41:06.000 --> 41:14.200]  I mean that's like saying a dead maggot has a 97% rating and it was just all these super
[41:14.200 --> 41:22.720]  weak, impotent little chicken-neck people and it was the London Guardian, the New York
[41:22.720 --> 41:27.280]  Times, the Washington Post, all the same thing, oh my gosh this is Satanism, it's American
[41:27.280 --> 41:33.360]  religion, everyone's adopting it, it's so cool, it's so wonderful, Satanists are good,
[41:33.360 --> 41:37.200]  they're the good people Satan was lied about, they're loving, it's the Christians that
[41:37.200 --> 41:40.960]  are bad, it's the Christians that want to hurt babies, of course in the show they come
[41:40.960 --> 41:46.120]  out how much they hate babies but it's all about inverting reality and gaslighting you
[41:46.120 --> 41:52.800]  by these horrible little wraiths who try to be as wraithlike as possible and have no association
[41:52.800 --> 41:59.920]  with life hoping to sucker in the giant hordes of jellyfish nerds that have been created
[41:59.920 --> 42:08.600]  at these universities, oh and then the director became a Satanist, yeah, became a Satanist,
[42:08.600 --> 42:16.800]  right, sure, sure you did and of course these are just the Renfield ghouls that are sent
[42:16.800 --> 42:22.480]  out to tell everybody oh it's for atheists, it's for liberals, yes, yes the left hand
[42:22.480 --> 42:28.860]  path and then you just look at how dead and miserable these people look and then making
[42:28.860 --> 42:37.200]  fun of babies bodies and everything and you just realize that my god, this country is
[42:37.200 --> 42:43.960]  on its last legs, the world is falling and of course when it all goes down, you know
[42:43.960 --> 42:53.800]  those that have sown the wind reap the whirlwind, it's just illustrative, uh oh I forgot, it's
[42:53.800 --> 43:00.800]  got them in schools with little children, why not, they've got the pedophiles in there
[43:00.800 --> 43:03.360]  with them, the globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[43:03.360 --> 43:08.600]  full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ, it
[43:08.600 --> 43:13.680]  literally dumps the population down and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers
[43:13.680 --> 43:20.040]  the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations, first seaweed based iodine
[43:20.040 --> 43:23.920]  that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalists tried to block us getting a
[43:23.920 --> 43:28.320]  supply of it, so we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought
[43:28.320 --> 43:33.120]  you X2, that's been incredible, now due to the establishment trying to block that, we
[43:33.120 --> 43:39.120]  did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemists,
[43:39.120 --> 43:43.920]  scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds,
[43:43.920 --> 43:52.000]  two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bio available, ladies
[43:52.000 --> 43:56.120]  and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery,
[43:56.120 --> 43:59.600]  X3 now available at m4slife.com.

[46:33.680 --> 46:37.960]  And we decided, I liked Secret 12 Plus, but they said, look, when you do Plus, people
[46:37.960 --> 46:39.560]  don't give that it means better and more.
[46:39.560 --> 46:40.560]  Just call it Ultra 12.
[46:40.560 --> 46:41.560]  Well, you know what?
[46:41.560 --> 46:42.560]  I don't like how the labels print it.
[46:42.560 --> 46:44.840]  And it just so happens, it already been labeled with the other one, we decided to change the
[46:44.840 --> 46:45.840]  name.
[46:45.840 --> 46:51.560]  So when you peel off the label, underneath it, it's Secret 12 Plus.

[47:03.000 --> 47:16.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:16.840 --> 47:28.080]  This country and the world's in a crisis.
[47:28.080 --> 47:32.320]  I know you don't need me to tell you that and I don't tell you that to demoralize you.
[47:32.320 --> 47:35.520]  I tell you that because I believe in you and God believes in you.
[47:35.520 --> 47:36.520]  We got to get serious.
[47:36.520 --> 47:37.520]  We got to get focused.
[47:37.520 --> 47:39.520]  We got to stop rolling over to evil.
[47:39.520 --> 47:43.880]  Let me tell you, it's crawling out of its holes.
[47:43.880 --> 47:47.520]  I'm going to cover this at the bottom of the next hour.
[47:47.520 --> 47:49.280]  I've said this a lot.
[47:49.280 --> 47:54.240]  I've known this for a long time, but going on and covering demonstrations around the
[47:54.240 --> 47:59.640]  country of the left, I can tell you not just here, but in Europe and many other areas,
[47:59.640 --> 48:10.600]  the actual operating system, like a computer program like Windows 2000 of the Democratic
[48:10.600 --> 48:19.320]  Party is Satanism and again, I remember, you know, three star Air Force generals telling
[48:19.320 --> 48:22.440]  me that 20 something years ago and I didn't believe it.
[48:22.440 --> 48:26.960]  I remember even though I grew up, there was a lot of that going on in Dallas and wealthy
[48:26.960 --> 48:27.960]  areas.
[48:27.960 --> 48:34.520]  These weren't white trash, anti-famethas, these were rich people and this was more luciferian,
[48:34.520 --> 48:37.320]  but it was the real deal.
[48:37.320 --> 48:50.080]  And even though I was around it, I still couldn't believe that it was this rampant.
[48:50.080 --> 48:54.080]  And that's what I'm going to be getting into at the bottom of the next hour.
[48:54.080 --> 49:02.000]  I meant to write some notes last night when I got home or today of watching Hell Satan
[49:02.000 --> 49:07.600]  this new movie and it was just like, that's the Democrats.
[49:07.600 --> 49:13.440]  And when I first five minutes in, I went, oh my gosh, it's the operating system.
[49:13.440 --> 49:17.360]  They're going to say this is the new religion of America and the Democratic operating system.
[49:17.360 --> 49:21.040]  They're going to show all these Democrats that said, oh, I was an atheist, but now I'm
[49:21.040 --> 49:22.040]  a Satanist.
[49:22.040 --> 49:24.640]  And it's a tongue-in-cheek thing, but it's real.
[49:24.640 --> 49:33.520]  And then this is how it's all rolled out and it's all about killing babies after they're
[49:33.520 --> 49:37.160]  born.
[49:37.160 --> 49:41.360]  And they talk about how bad babies are and how we need to kill them and how they're scum
[49:41.360 --> 49:46.080]  and how we need to stop putting them up on a pedestal, how we need to trample babies.
[49:46.080 --> 49:51.160]  And I was in this theater with all these Austin Liberals, all these weak men like squirming
[49:51.160 --> 49:55.200]  and drinking their beer and getting off of it and I looked at all the men and women.
[49:55.200 --> 49:56.520]  They were all ugly.
[49:56.520 --> 49:59.840]  The men were all super weak.
[49:59.840 --> 50:04.320]  The weakest of the weak, the ugliest of the ugliest, these are Satan's minions.
[50:04.320 --> 50:12.000]  These are Satan's servants.
[50:12.000 --> 50:14.680]  We have to bring God back into America.
[50:14.680 --> 50:26.000]  We have to do it now because if we don't have God in America, the vacuum's open and in comes
[50:26.000 --> 50:27.800]  the worst scum you could ever imagine.
[50:27.800 --> 50:33.080]  I have stacks of news here today.
[50:33.080 --> 50:35.560]  Member Little Desmond is amazing.
[50:35.560 --> 50:41.680]  Since he's five years old, he performs as a drag queen and does skits about taking ketamine
[50:41.680 --> 50:48.920]  and other date rape drugs with convicted killers on television.
[50:48.920 --> 50:51.200]  And they say on the TV show, I want you to be corrupted.
[50:51.200 --> 50:58.840]  Bring your children close to the TV and all the convicted pedophiles they catch running
[50:58.840 --> 51:02.840]  these drag queen storyteller kids will now converse shoes.
[51:02.840 --> 51:03.840]  It's all the same thing.
[51:03.840 --> 51:04.920]  It's all devil worship.
[51:04.920 --> 51:06.440]  It's all the same people.
[51:06.440 --> 51:08.320]  It's all the club kid stuff.
[51:08.320 --> 51:15.240]  What's in this Hail Satan movie is men dressed up like babies having sex with each other.
[51:15.240 --> 51:18.840]  It's all just mainlining pedophilia.
[51:18.840 --> 51:19.840]  That's what it is.
[51:19.840 --> 51:22.000]  It's a bath of men having sex with their children.
[51:22.000 --> 51:23.400]  That's the bottom of the barrel.
[51:23.400 --> 51:26.080]  That's where the rat hole leads.
[51:26.080 --> 51:27.680]  Their total destruction.
[51:27.680 --> 51:40.720]  Stop with the little children under me, Jesus wept, and that's where these people are going.
[51:40.720 --> 51:41.920]  That's who they are.
[51:41.920 --> 51:48.480]  That's what they want to do.
[51:48.480 --> 51:49.960]  And we have to stand against them.
[51:49.960 --> 51:55.920]  All right, I'm going to get a bunch of other issues next hour on Trump and his tax returns
[51:55.920 --> 51:59.800]  and what's really behind that and Trump's noble moment, waving executive privilege on
[51:59.800 --> 52:04.800]  Mueller's report, something no other presidents ever done, and the situation when I ran and
[52:04.800 --> 52:09.760]  the situation on this school getting attacked by a Trump hater that wanted to kill Christians.
[52:09.760 --> 52:10.760]  She'll see that story.
[52:10.760 --> 52:12.760]  Leave the news very, very quickly.
[52:12.760 --> 52:17.880]  And so much more today, this poor little black girl missing down in Houston.
[52:17.880 --> 52:21.480]  When I first heard about it, I said, that story sounds outlandish.
[52:21.480 --> 52:24.760]  I bet the dad's going to end up being the main suspect.
[52:24.760 --> 52:25.960]  That was the first day it happened.
[52:25.960 --> 52:27.600]  I didn't say that on air.
[52:27.600 --> 52:29.760]  I didn't say, small it they won't on air.
[52:29.760 --> 52:33.520]  And now he's the person of interest and the story's not adding up and the story's totally
[52:33.520 --> 52:34.520]  changed.
[52:34.520 --> 52:37.400]  But see, you're not supposed to question things when they don't make sense.
[52:37.400 --> 52:40.760]  You're supposed to do what you're told.
[52:40.760 --> 52:49.640]  And I've got a lot more coming up in the next hour as well, but here's the final equation.
[52:49.640 --> 52:54.720]  When we don't value human life and we don't stand up for each other for standards of truth
[52:54.720 --> 53:00.240]  and justice and fight for it, evil every time comes in and takes over because there is a
[53:00.240 --> 53:05.920]  large percentage of people who are followers and they will follow evil if they believe
[53:05.920 --> 53:09.440]  that that is the way they're going to succeed.
[53:09.440 --> 53:13.600]  And once you open up Pandora's box, it's like opening a gateway to hell.
[53:13.600 --> 53:18.640]  And that gateway is open right now.
[53:18.640 --> 53:26.400]  And they're not coming for your children.
[53:26.400 --> 53:30.680]  They've already got your children in most cases.
[53:30.680 --> 53:35.760]  So we're going to break it all down coming up today, very, very serious broadcast.
[53:35.760 --> 53:37.440]  The enemy is highly funded.
[53:37.440 --> 53:38.440]  We are not.
[53:38.440 --> 53:44.720]  I try to make it easy to support us by having the best products you're going to find out
[53:44.720 --> 53:45.720]  there.
[53:45.720 --> 53:51.520]  The Pro is their largest stainless steel countertop unit, great for RVs, great for homes, great
[53:51.520 --> 53:52.520]  for offices.
[53:52.520 --> 53:56.400]  It is the best filter, gravity-fed filter out of hundreds in the world that have been
[53:56.400 --> 53:57.400]  tested.
[53:57.400 --> 54:03.560]  The highest testing rate, the highest, hundreds and hundreds of chemicals that come up zero,
[54:03.560 --> 54:08.000]  hundreds and hundreds of chemicals that come up, you know, zero, zero, zero, zero point.
[54:08.000 --> 54:10.240]  It's the best and it has the highest volume.
[54:10.240 --> 54:13.800]  There's some other units out there that are as good, but they have almost no volume.
[54:13.800 --> 54:16.480]  And most units just take out the bad taste and do nothing.
[54:16.480 --> 54:23.840]  It's the lowest price ever sold because the Alexa Pure company produced a giant mass of
[54:23.840 --> 54:28.440]  them and because they know they get secondary marketing from us when I just plug Alexa Pure
[54:28.440 --> 54:31.720]  as the best, they think they get as many sales off that as they get from me selling it.
[54:31.720 --> 54:37.120]  I have the biggest distributor of their system in the world, $199.95.
[54:37.120 --> 54:42.040]  They're normally $350 retail, usually selling about $275.
[54:42.040 --> 54:46.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, you need to get one of these for your children, for yourself,
[54:46.920 --> 54:51.200]  for your preschool, for your church, whatever the case is, it does over 10,000 gallons.
[54:51.200 --> 54:52.880]  The replacement filters are very inexpensive.
[54:52.880 --> 54:55.280]  We sell those as well.
[54:55.280 --> 54:59.360]  Up on the site, up on infowarstore.com, we have the Mike Adams breakdown with the test
[54:59.360 --> 55:03.600]  he did plus other tests, so you can see the testing for yourself.
[55:03.600 --> 55:06.800]  Some other great filters that we sell as well that are right up there with Alexa Pure like
[55:06.800 --> 55:10.120]  Pro Pure and others that also test this as good.
[55:10.120 --> 55:16.280]  infowarstore.com, infowarslife.com, or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three,
[55:16.280 --> 55:17.280]  nine.
[55:17.280 --> 55:25.920]  Now, that said, also, we've been sold out for five months of Secret 12 and I made a big
[55:25.920 --> 55:30.640]  year contract out to get a better deal and we reformulated it with the highest quality
[55:30.640 --> 55:33.000]  methylcobalamin that there is.
[55:33.000 --> 55:34.000]  You put it under your tongue.
[55:34.000 --> 55:35.240]  That's how you're able to absorb more of it.
[55:35.240 --> 55:38.600]  If you want, just gulp it down, but you don't get a few percentage points that way.
[55:38.600 --> 55:41.400]  It's got to be under the tongue, second best way to have it.
[55:41.400 --> 55:42.400]  The other way is injectable.
[55:42.400 --> 55:44.800]  Got to get there from a doctor, but it's the same stuff.
[55:44.800 --> 55:49.060]  Medical grade methylcobalamin, don't inject, so it's not, you know, this is not approved
[55:49.060 --> 55:50.060]  for that.
[55:50.060 --> 55:51.560]  It's the same stuff.
[55:51.560 --> 55:57.600]  infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com, 50% out of the gates, Secret 12.
[55:57.600 --> 56:03.840]  Now, Secret 12 sold out, so this is now known as Ultra 12 because I'm not going to just
[56:03.840 --> 56:04.840]  call it Secret 12 plus.
[56:04.840 --> 56:05.840]  People don't get it.
[56:05.840 --> 56:07.160]  It's twice as much methylcobalamin.
[56:07.160 --> 56:11.600]  It's twice as strong for the same price, and we're doing it 50% off.
[56:11.600 --> 56:15.400]  You're getting very close to our cost at that because only you see how amazing it is.
[56:15.400 --> 56:18.000]  You saw the thousands of 5-star reviews for Secret 12.
[56:18.000 --> 56:27.320]  This is Secret 12, just twice as strong, Ultra 12, Ultra 12, infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com.
[56:27.320 --> 56:28.320]  You want real energy?
[56:28.320 --> 56:29.320]  You want real focus?
[56:29.320 --> 56:34.280]  So that started taking an iodine and Secret 12 five, six years ago.
[56:34.280 --> 56:36.160]  The doctor group said this would happen.
[56:36.160 --> 56:40.120]  I had sunspots because I like the sun, I like the fish, I like to get outdoors, I like to
[56:40.120 --> 56:45.040]  garden, I can be down, I can go out and take my shirt off and water the plants for an hour
[56:45.040 --> 56:48.360]  or whatever with the kids in the yard, do a little bit of gardening, and I just feel energized
[56:48.360 --> 56:49.360]  again.
[56:49.360 --> 56:50.360]  That's my Prozac.
[56:50.360 --> 56:57.120]  And I would still get sunspots, 95% of the sunspots went away when I went on.
[56:57.120 --> 57:01.400]  True vitamin B12 methylcobalamin and X2, but that's why you've got to remember to take
[57:01.400 --> 57:02.400]  your iodine.
[57:02.400 --> 57:06.640]  But the X2 type, I'm telling you, it holds your stomach, this is the pure stuff, and
[57:06.640 --> 57:08.040]  your methylcobalamin.
[57:08.040 --> 57:11.680]  infowarsstore.com, or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.

[57:31.640 --> 57:32.640]  coming.
[57:32.640 --> 57:34.320]  So we've got to push back.
[57:34.320 --> 57:39.240]  And yes, if the Bible's coming true, they're going to win major battles and have their
[57:39.240 --> 57:42.080]  time, but then we will win the war.
[57:42.080 --> 57:46.600]  We will win the war, but we've got to get as many souls as we can now.

[58:52.680 --> 58:56.000]  in modern medicine introducing pollen block.
[58:56.000 --> 59:01.160]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[59:01.160 --> 59:08.040]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[59:08.040 --> 59:13.880]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experience
[59:13.880 --> 59:17.240]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[59:17.240 --> 59:22.160]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit
[59:22.160 --> 59:28.600]  of this research, a fast acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[59:28.600 --> 59:33.680]  Pollen block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine, in fact current research
[59:33.680 --> 59:38.560]  has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme
[59:38.560 --> 59:42.640]  that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[59:42.640 --> 59:45.320]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[59:45.320 --> 59:54.120]  Get to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[59:54.120 --> 01:00:23.080]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:33.080]  So, I was just talking to one of the crew members and he pointed out he went and saw
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:40.080]  him in-game, no not the film I made 11 years ago, about a planetary extinction program.
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:48.080]  I know this is a universal extinction program movie, I've read the synopsis of it.
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:53.240]  But Matt was saying that full grown men were crying, yeah the last time I went and saw an
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:59.040]  Avengers movie, I forget the name of it, it was like three years ago, and it was cut
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:03.800]  to like what looked like video game battles, it was kind of like the first hobbit was pretty
[01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:08.440]  good, the new one and then by the five armies when it was like video game, they got so cheap
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:17.560]  like they live action video game people fighting and they got so cheap with the CG, so the
[01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:21.720]  last Avengers movie I watched, because you know they've had some of those Marvel movies
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:24.360]  where they actually have characters that are pretty good, usually when they make the first
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:27.200]  one it's good, like Guardians of the Galaxy the first one, even though it's got the pro
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:31.520]  pedophilia director, was a pretty entertaining film, developed the characters, had some funny
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:36.080]  things, was pretty decent, you go see the next one, it's worse, it's worse, but the
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:41.120]  one I saw about the Avengers was where somehow like part of the planet is getting lifted
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:44.200]  up in Russia and it's going to kill everybody in the city and they're all having this battle
[01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:50.440]  and it was just unwatchable, it's like Fast and Furious 7 was the one I saw, first Fast
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:55.240]  and Furious was pretty good, but people racing cars, Fast and Furious I think it was 7, they
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:02:01.720]  drive cars down a mountain for 30 minutes running into boulders and jumping off cliffs
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:06.680]  and none of their tires blow out, I mean the Dukes of Hazard they'd have a stuntman, people
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:13.480]  by the way died in some of those stunts, famous stuntman would die in stunts, jumping over
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:18.680]  rivers with the General Lee man, that's a real car jumping over and they would destroy
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:25.480]  the car when it went across, but I mean you go see like, and I don't see it like it's
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:37.760]  fantasy but it's crazy and the public seems to like things that are totally fantasy land
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:44.200]  so the thing that Matt was saying earlier is that the new gods for America and the world
[01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:50.480]  are Thor, so I guess we have the Norse gods back and you know he's kind of the good god
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:57.800]  versus the bad god Thanos and so we go back to all this and then meanwhile there's people
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:01.400]  that have taken on the Ark type of Satan and they want to come into school and they want
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:07.640]  to talk to your kids without your consent and they want to talk about how worthless
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:12.800]  babies are and how let's just kill them, oh but there's no god, there's no energy and
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:19.440]  these people look like they had their souls sucked out, there was like a little dead fish
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:24.080]  laying in the sun that's already had like ants eat all the flesh off of them that's
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:31.000]  just kind of scales and a rotten eyeball and you're like the people ushering me to my
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:36.720]  table for dinner look like they had their soul ripped out their hind end, I don't think
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:41.320]  I want to be a part of this religion, I like the one that when you actually follow it you
[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:46.640]  get giant and glistening buildings, beautiful architecture, life assistant technology, beautiful
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:57.600]  families, wonderful children, gorgeous art, just incredible systems, I don't worship ugliness
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:03.400]  but that's what these people do and they always want to make it uglier and uglier and uglier
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:09.000]  and uglier because they're ugly at a spiritual level and they want to project their hate
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:14.680]  of themselves on to you and they want to make their behavior more and more outrageous like
[01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:22.680]  serial killers do so they get caught so you stop them, they want you to stop them and
[01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:33.840]  we are, don't worry because god's going to stop them but I want to explain, the soullessness
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:40.080]  of the left hand path democrats, the lowest the low, needed to see the twisted, ugly
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:48.640]  hunchback beyond sub minion glorified in a ridiculous film to believe that they're powerful
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:54.000]  to be sucked in by the real satanist, to be sucked in even further and then exploited
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:58.560]  against the youth.
[01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:04.200]  Our grandparents knew that they can't food during the fall so they have it during the

[01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:26.160]  coming to you live from the front lines of the info war okay we're into the second hour
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:33.560]  ladies and gentlemen and everybody and their dog he's talking about Donald John Trump's
[01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:41.800]  tax returns now why have they been obsessed with that because they know full well that
[01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:49.520]  Trump's been quite public about this since the mid-1990s that many times when you do
[01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:56.000]  a big expansion of real estate and especially if you expand those developments of hotels
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:03.680]  and golf courses and living spaces condos that if a market goes down for a while it could
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:11.480]  take a decade until you stop losing money that's why during boom times you always see
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:15.160]  all the buildings start going up and when you're not in a boom time you don't see that
[01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:19.560]  that's why suddenly in its city you might see five cranes ten cranes twenty cranes
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:26.200]  a big manhattan fifty cranes but when you're in a recession you don't see any cranes unless
[01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:29.240]  it's a repair crane because you better not start construction during that because you
[01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:34.600]  don't know when you're gonna come out of it so people go get loans and then they build
[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:43.280]  and then until the company starts making money you don't pay taxes now I never did stuff
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:48.680]  like that with our little operation because we just have info wars we just have free speech
[01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:53.920]  systems and so it's one company but the way everybody else does it is they make a film
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:58.920]  they make a corporation to your filmmaker like I am and then if that film loses money
[01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:05.040]  they just write that corporation off I just make a film and then it's just part of the
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:08.440]  overall operation because we see it as a loss anyways because it's just meant to get the
[01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:12.960]  information out that's a different philosophy but if you're in real estate it's all about
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:18.600]  leveraging debt it's all about going sometimes five ten years not making a profit and then
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:22.640]  making huge profits after that but then leveraging that again into new projects that go into
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:28.040]  debt so you don't pay the taxes you hear about general electric and Microsoft and Apple paying
[01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:33.040]  zero tax they manipulate all that as well they're offshore and they don't really build
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:39.840]  much infrastructure here Trump builds service infrastructure so years ago on the apprentice
[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:46.520]  have the clip right here Trump came out and talked about losing billions in the very
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:53.400]  period that they're now talking about this is Trump talks about losing billions in the
[01:08:53.400 --> 01:09:03.200]  1990s New York my city where the wheels of the global economy never stop turning a concrete
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:12.240]  metropolis of unparalleled strength and purpose that drives the business world Manhattan is
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:18.640]  a tough place this island is the real job if you're not careful it can chew you up and
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:32.160]  spit you out but if you work hard you can really hit it big and I mean really big my
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:37.120]  name is Donald Trump and I'm the largest real estate developer in New York I own buildings
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:45.320]  all over the place model agencies the Miss Universe pageant jetliners golf courses casinos
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:50.040]  and private resorts like Mar-a-Lago one of the most spectacular states anywhere in the
[01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:57.080]  world but it wasn't always so easy about 13 years ago I was seriously in trouble I was
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:04.000]  billions of dollars in debt but I fought back and I won big league I used my brain I used
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.800]  my negotiating skills and I worked it all out now my company is bigger than it ever
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:18.160]  was it's stronger than it ever was and I'm having more fun than I ever had so the Democrats
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:24.200]  know all this about Trump and they know that if anything Trump's not being disingenuous
[01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:28.120]  here because I've read some of his books and I read some kid was hockey books he wrote
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:33.040]  with them when you're doing real estate on this grand scale and building all these buildings
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:39.360]  you better again they're they're each in their own corporation so the ones that are losing
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:43.520]  money until they make money are losing money and the ones that are making money yeah then
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:48.600]  you leverage into something else because if you were paying off what you really made as
[01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:56.480]  one company well then things that failed could bring you down or things that succeeded even
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:11:00.560]  though you had things that were failing would have to pay for the things that were failing
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:04.880]  see how that works but then once the company's become profitable then you pay the taxes why
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:08.720]  should you pay taxes on a building that you just built a few years before that you owe
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:13.000]  hundreds of millions of dollars on that you just finally filled up with tenants no it
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:21.560]  takes time to let anybody knows that about an operation I've put into info wars and what
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:30.360]  we've done in 24 years conservatively I've done the math before it's about a year ago
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:36.520]  but we've put over 200 million dollars into this operation oh yeah probably 30 something
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:42.960]  million in bandwidth and web hosting I mean it costs money to make money but my mission
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:49.040]  is not to make money it's nothing wrong with making money but I'm trying to change the
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:54.680]  world and get a message out so again I fly coach a lot of the time once I get a good
[01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:58.960]  deal because I want to put the money back into the operation yeah I live in a nice four-bedroom
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:04.160]  house I got swimming pool I got a decent $60,000 car but that's not my god now Trump's got
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:09.000]  a brand of this flamboyant you know you fake it till you make it type stuff where folks
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.040]  want to go and feel like they're in a glitzy place that's great it's marketing his airplanes
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:17.800]  his helicopters all of it makes perfect sense he's a glitzy guy beautiful you know wife
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:23.400]  makes sense that's not what I'm doing I am in the trenches building an operation but
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:30.280]  I know how businesses work if you die like his dad would have with 30 something big buildings
[01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:35.320]  and golf courses and stuff the government would have taken half of it so you're absolutely
[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:40.880]  right that Fred Wolf from the time his son was born and his daughters and his other son
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:49.120]  was putting money into the company in their name they didn't get it until he died but
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:53.120]  of course he was doing that that's what you do I put money in my children's accounts
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:57.880]  not a lot compared to those guys but money so they can have college or medical stuff
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:03.120]  in the future so that happens to me this is how business is done this is totally standard
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:09.800]  and I'm not defending Trump over this I'm defending reality but you just heard him say
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:15.640]  I almost went under in the early 1990s he didn't just leverage things he didn't just
[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:24.560]  write off stuff where he was losing because of some casinos and things he did almost lose
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:28.440]  it so again the idea is he's not a successful businessman of course there's people like
[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:33.920]  Zuckerberg worth 76 billion dollars off a big pump and dunk Bilderberg surveillance scam
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:37.840]  thing and of course you got Apple all its slave factories in China trillion dollar company
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:42.880]  and hundreds of billions for its owners Trump has made his money off golf courses and hotels
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:48.400]  and condos and casinos and restaurants and stuff like that and he hired a lot of people
[01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:53.080]  I see that as pretty moral compared to the globalist Trump doesn't know any slave factories
[01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:56.160]  but it's how they try to deceive you they keep telling you for years when we get his
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:14:03.040]  tax returns from these years we're going to show you that he's a big loser okay well
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:08.600]  Trump came back and he ran for the first time ever for office and won and beat you the whole
[01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:13.360]  deep state the whole corporate media Silicon Valley pledging to deliver it all to Hillary
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:17.880]  so does that make me like Trump more or less it makes me like him more don't you like me
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:21.600]  more because I've been fighting so hard not giving up I like you more because I know what
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:27.440]  you go through supporting us and support America we're fighters we're not giving into all this
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:34.160]  crap but the idea that Trump's hiding something or he's a scammer or all this they get the
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:39.120]  rest of his tax returns they're going to harass everybody he's in business with everybody
[01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:45.920]  he's got contracts with believe me I've been experiencing it in my own life that's what
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:51.560]  these mafia people do is they persecute they harass they threaten they bully so let me
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:57.320]  tell you why Trump's trying to keep his tax returns secret he has to put in as he said
[01:14:57.320 --> 01:15:03.440]  hundreds and hundreds of tax returns every year on each business each company each operation
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:10.200]  that's how all the other companies operate in Hollywood every new movie of production
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:14.320]  houses so it has all those different cards at the front or all the different companies
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:17.920]  people involved it's all divided up all the liabilities divided up because of all the
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:24.480]  lawyers and lawsuits and so they get his tax returns in the modern time they're going
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:32.040]  to use it as a bombing run as a targeting operation to know who to hit to know who to
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:36.720]  harass do you know the level of harassment Trump associates get believe me I'm seen as
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:41.360]  a Trump associate it's been intense but it just makes me know I'm right about these crooks
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:45.200]  they got to be defeated all right we're going to come back I've got more on this I'm going

[01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:28.680]  we're listening to the alex jones show
[01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:36.520]  let me just recap what i was getting into in the last segment i'm getting all the other
[01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:44.400]  news again i know our audience is mainly nationalistic conservative free market and right from
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:49.320]  hardworking red-blooded blue collar folks that keep this country going right up to some
[01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:52.880]  of the richest people in the country that are patriots there's not a lot of the ultra
[01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:56.280]  rich that are patriots because most of them got it through the system but trump somebody
[01:20:56.280 --> 01:21:03.640]  that made it actually through services trumps tax returns are amongst the most voluminous
[01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:10.720]  and complex in the world because real estate tax returns are the most complex because each
[01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:16.840]  property is its own entity whether it's having a profit or loss and you never want to mix
[01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:21.320]  them all in together for liability and for so many reasons i already laid all that out
[01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:25.960]  and anybody that knows basic business knows this most of us are going yes and next you're
[01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:31.480]  going to tell us how to tire shoelaces remember the broadcast is not just for our listeners
[01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:37.440]  you know more than i do most of you it's your job to get this feed out to the average leftist
[01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:40.200]  that actually believes socialism works and believes they're going to get free health
[01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:49.080]  care free living wage free education free housing free free free free so they're running
[01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:56.720]  around saying trump is this idiot he lost a billion dollars from 1985 to 1991 yeah he
[01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:59.960]  lost a billion dollars because of new construction he started up and he had some casino problems
[01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:04.760]  but he made it back but again that's the deception here that trumps a loser he didn't want to
[01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:10.240]  win he's a grifter he's a scammer that was the headline on CNN this morning trump has
[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:16.200]  his emperors new clothes moment you know the emperors new clothes parable where these scammers
[01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:20.400]  come to town and they say only nobles can see this golden silk that we spend and so they
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:23.960]  spend this beautiful jacket they have this woman with them that acts like a con artist
[01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:29.040]  and says oh it's so beautiful the king can't see it the emperor can't see it so the emperor
[01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:36.720]  thinks well i better say i see it or or or they'll think i'm not the emperor well finally
[01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:40.920]  he's completely butt naked at a parade except for underwear he's given him half the wealth
[01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:45.000]  of the kingdom to spend the secret silk and a three-year-old steps forward and laughs
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:51.160]  and says look the king has no clothes the emperor has no clothes what's called the emperor
[01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:56.360]  has no clothes or the emperors new clothes is the original old fable name like look that
[01:22:56.360 --> 01:23:01.840]  up is that old english or old french i think it's like 500 years old let's uh look up the
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:08.240]  providence of the emperors new clothes so they're saying trump has no clothes really
[01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:13.560]  i thought the private federal reserve being set up in 1913 106 years ago being private
[01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:19.840]  run for profit i thought it had no clothes it's danish author hans christiansen anderson
[01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:24.960]  i guess the guy that gave us the little mermaid so there you go that's only a couple hundred
[01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:28.840]  years old but a lot of his stuff was based on parables that were already out there but
[01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:32.760]  whatever i'm wrong i like to fact check stuff it's i'm going from memory here but it's an
[01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:39.480]  old parable i'm not just defending trump i'm defending reality trumps delivered on a lot
[01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:45.720]  of what he said he'd do the globalists have delivered on almost nothing and they just
[01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:52.560]  continue to sit there and say there is no border there is no caravan there is no crisis
[01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:55.720]  and they say that for a year and then when that doesn't work they go oh my gosh it's
[01:23:55.720 --> 01:24:02.120]  the worst crisis we've ever seen and it's donald john trumps fault and they've got
[01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:06.080]  the other emperors new clothes that donald trumps said all mexicans are criminals never
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:10.120]  said anything like that well that alex jones is a white supremacist i have a stack of articles
[01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:17.240]  here today in the london guardian and all over the world saying alex jones is a white
[01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:22.160]  supremacist and nizel ferrari's leading his new briggs party that's already bigger than
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:28.240]  ukip is now a white supremacist because he hangs out with alex jones it's just total
[01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:37.320]  fraud they should be so discredited by this and a word to the lies for hope not hate
[01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:42.080]  and facebook and all this what's in his planning to take the election he has to he's doing
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:46.680]  his own money he's really upset and as i mentioned at the start of the show i'll get into this
[01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:51.260]  more later they are openly announcing all over the news now what i told you camilla
[01:24:51.260 --> 01:24:56.040]  harris said it as well in double acp meeting yesterday she said we're gonna list conservatives
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:25:04.280]  and nationalists haters she says as terrorists and we're gonna take your internet id away
[01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:08.800]  so they're setting up an internet id and then you can have it taken away and what is facebook
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:14.720]  saying you can't promote alex jones or we'll take your id away on facebook they're getting
[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:22.560]  you ready for it all and yes paul has now tweeted about this interesting message i received
[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:29.560]  from the the high powered law firm in london if pjw sues discovery would likely begin
[01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:37.680]  with light the entry corporation decision making process that led to the purge internal
[01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:42.840]  standards emails meeting notes presentations you name it but turns out facebook is banning
[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:48.160]  based on ideology the entire world would change which they already are we already know what's
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:56.400]  going on internally because i happened to have some intel here that ties into intel
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:26:05.680]  we already had and why they're trying to race and why they're going as fast as they can
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:10.520]  to have ai do all the censoring but humans still have to oversee it because ai can't
[01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:17.800]  understand memes guess what i have here i always say i'm gonna do something i don't
[01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:27.800]  do it you guys remind me star of the next hour we'll have dan liman on it 115 from europe
[01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:32.880]  wars dot com the amazing developments there i'm going to cover this at the start of the
[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:39.880]  next hour and you're not gonna well you are gonna believe it but do you know what's happening
[01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:48.120]  to the people that have to censor the show can you imagine i was told this by executives
[01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:51.360]  and then i saw some news admitting it but not saying my name and then this obviously
[01:26:51.360 --> 01:27:02.480]  breaks it down from pbs skw's that are made to watch my show to monitor it and censor
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:09.200]  it upwards of half of them are quote becoming programmed and brainwashed and then totally
[01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:15.360]  freaking out and then they are grabbing them in these facilities and taking them to mental
[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:23.840]  institutions so so the yes big tech is an actual cult folks it's skw cults just like
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:28.880]  cognac said i like trump they throw in a mental institution they're baker acting people at
[01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:33.880]  facebook and at twitter and other places that when they tell them i'm a nazi and then they
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:38.880]  go watch years of my show these people can absolutely finally find their soul and go
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:43.840]  oh my god alex jones didn't do any of this stuff and other people they're watching just
[01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:49.240]  like in the lives of others was based on a compositor stories or the stasi guy spying
[01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:54.240]  on people and he watches them commit suicide because of what the party's doing to him and
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:58.280]  he watches you know women committing suicide he watches the party leaders making women
[01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:03.880]  have sex with them to have a job and he just totally freaked out he can't do it anymore
[01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:09.640]  well these people actually are in our private messages they're on our phones man they're
[01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:14.800]  reading every these are intelligence officers of the big tech they're watching you in live
[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:22.640]  time they're doing stuff the NSA did it they go to prison like that and the word is that
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:29.800]  they then start spying on the employees monitoring them and actually have private eyes that spy
[01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:34.360]  on them and spy on all their devices and what do you think happens once they find their
[01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:40.160]  big spot on they convert back to americana just like that just like winston who is the
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:46.600]  base on the real orwell at in mi6 os s at the bbc and that whole book isn't about the
[01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:52.280]  soviet union it's about where he thought england would go in the future under sjw communism

[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:07.200]  to say turbo force is amazing it is but if you took it with fish oil it's like the fish
[01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:11.320]  oil is it the fish oil is better than it and that's an example of what i'm talking about
[01:31:11.320 --> 01:31:17.280]  fish oil is liquid energy brain body heart the cleanest the best out there you've got
[01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:20.920]  the children's you've got the adults you've got the krill oil if you're going to get
[01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:24.640]  the full effect the fish oil and the children's are really strong they don't give you the burpees
[01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:28.880]  but krill oils is the best and it'll give you the damn burps and i'm sorry you want
[01:31:28.880 --> 01:31:32.960]  something like this you don't get stuff for free the krill is hallucinogenic it's so good
[01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:36.560]  it in my view i'm not a medical statement here but let me tell you something i eat five
[01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:42.720]  capillates of krill oil before i go to bed i'm seeing santa claus that night so your
[01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:51.560]  brain is made basically out of what fish oil is so we don't make a big profit off of it
[01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:55.320]  but you notice i just obsessed because whatever the best is we've got i just can't lie to

[01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:43.120]  in their mind it's what they want to believe well the bottom feeding lowest of the low
[01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:51.840]  satanist that worked with hollywood and the real satanist to produce hell satan got one
[01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:59.840]  thing right in their film and that's when abraham is going to kill his own son the god gave
[01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:07.720]  him to show total and complete loyalty that it's god that does the killing and god that
[01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:17.880]  delivers the vengeance and god that demands blood but god demands blood of the strong
[01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:25.160]  in the battle against evil and god demands sacrifice not hedonism not worship of yourself
[01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:32.440]  and those of you that continue to seek after the empowerment of yourself only will never
[01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:42.680]  find god as the thunder claps above my head rage for the sky those that seek power do

[01:34:57.640 --> 01:35:06.440]  because they are fools now i want to be a hundred percent clear hell satan is a masterwork
[01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:16.160]  of evil it is done like it's a joke at first and funny and they're just atheists and this
[01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:22.240]  is all silly and they're just first amendment advocates that are fighting so hard to make
[01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:28.400]  sure these crazy right wing christians don't destroy our wonderful pluralistic society that
[01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:40.160]  was america founded by our christian and theist forbearers and i thought i'd go see it because
[01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:44.760]  i was already familiar with the satanic temples activities and the people involved in all
[01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:52.720]  of it and that it was a big hollywood pr roll out to make satanism a modern pop satanism
[01:35:52.720 --> 01:36:05.960]  a religious organizational system around which around which they could try to organize now
[01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:12.320]  the majority that says they're not religious but who in their iconography in their logos
[01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:22.200]  in their action where the banner of slaves of satan they're not actual satanist these
[01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:36.600]  are the people that where the regalia the satran area of blood to be fed to rats so
[01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:45.760]  they are simply the blood enticement at the opening of the gate they think they're feeding
[01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:50.480]  children in it they themselves are fed in so there's simply the enticement of the chumming
[01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:56.800]  of the water these are all the lowest of the low no discernment called by their father the
[01:36:56.800 --> 01:37:07.560]  devil like moths to a feted flame so pulling back i knew immediately i told my wife i said

[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:23.720]  and worldwide as a new system to counter the threat of authoritarian christianity they'll
[01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:30.800]  also talk about the satanism craze is what it really was and backlash or hysteria of
[01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:35.840]  the 1980s and she's like oh no it's a joke i heard it's a joke from my friends and i
[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:42.840]  said no it's not a joke and five minutes of the movie i lean over and i go see now soon
[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:47.080]  they'll tell you actually a bunch of us really are into the occult and you look at these people
[01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:55.920]  they look so damned so upset so scared so weak so grasping and it's all sjw third wave
[01:37:55.920 --> 01:38:01.640]  feminism babies are bad put them on a pedestal their pieces of crap get in there and kill
[01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:08.080]  that baby in the womb women show your real power show us who you are i mean this is just
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:13.240]  for soulless leftist that have three or four college loans never got the job they wanted
[01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:17.160]  they're on a bunch of pros act they play video games all day they're freaked out they're waddling
[01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:20.920]  around they don't believe in god they don't believe in the spiritual realm they've been
[01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:28.520]  left wide open and now there's the deception come to us we look like you we're ugly we're
[01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:34.640]  nerdly we're obese we're stupid we're fake we're making jokes about it and then they
[01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:43.200]  get you on the line and they say actually this is real and then oh the director converted
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:50.240]  into satanism oh i'm sure the director just converted see i i didn't get a bird's eye
[01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:55.960]  view into garden variety satanists that kill their dog out in the woods on pcp i mean
[01:38:55.960 --> 01:39:00.120]  i knew about those in the eighties i knew who was directing it and of course it's come
[01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:04.720]  out who was directing it you know the beatniks and the hippies were all a cia creation and
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:10.720]  they were actually satanist they were actually going and doing the real sex orgies and the
[01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:17.240]  real events and the real things and i'm gonna just stop right there but these people would
[01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:25.400]  never get within a mile or never know about real satanism or real luciferianism i have
[01:39:25.400 --> 01:39:34.360]  seen it now let's continue what they're really doing is roping in all these people sucking
[01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:38.480]  them in like this is how we freak out the christians this is how we do it this is how
[01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:43.800]  we dress up in costumes this is how we dress up as actors we're we're actors we're not
[01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:49.080]  really believing in satanism but then within 10 minutes they say it's clear that an actor
[01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:54.000]  who isn't really a satanist can't do this i've been a satanist since i was a child i'll
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:40:00.920]  be the leader and then they even break off like pita is the friendly group like the ira
[01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:05.800]  is the bad group and then shin fame is the friendly group oh the woman breaks off to
[01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:10.960]  go run the radical underground satanist terror group that's gonna kill trump and everyone
[01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:16.000]  winks winks and oh you know the average leftist wouldn't get the esoteric double and triple
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:24.760]  meanings of it all it was a glorification of a bunch of demented weak nerds who've
[01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:29.360]  made no real sacrifices in their lives and who are trying to find satan to give them
[01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:34.600]  power from the world system to try to raise money off other nerds who want some operating
[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:44.160]  system but what it is is the fact of the democratic party in the last 10 years has gone completely
[01:40:44.160 --> 01:40:49.240]  satanism as their operating system and if you go to any other events or any other operations
[01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:54.720]  this isn't people rebelling listening to motley crew in the 80s this isn't uh you know people
[01:40:54.720 --> 01:41:01.040]  getting off on high energy and rebellion just normal human things god gave us was an aspect
[01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:07.000]  of who we are that's god giving us that these are people who are having all of their energy
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:12.160]  siphoned off because they believe they're going to get some big faustian dividend of
[01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:18.240]  power if they do it but they're not and again you say why would they put out to the old
[01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:23.440]  satanism model the sexy beautiful voluptuous woman to lure in businessmen and powerful
[01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:33.680]  people and to really that's real satanism cults this is meant to be stunted dead eyed
[01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:39.400]  super weak and shown as powerful because they've already gotten the giant masses of leftist
[01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:43.840]  to be soulless and have no connection to god and so they'll never know what hit them when
[01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:47.440]  the devil tells you at the start we don't believe in the devil we don't believe in god get
[01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:54.160]  rid of that actor i do believe in devil i'm god and then they show you all of this different
[01:41:54.160 --> 01:42:00.640]  vile iconography from real satanism and real events and real things that go on where people
[01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:08.720]  try to shed themselves of their elemental connection to god with these governors god
[01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:13.920]  put in us to not want to kill a young baby or not want to kill an innocent person or
[01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:20.000]  not want to do horrible things with this person you do this to have god damn you and god push
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:24.640]  you away and turn you over to a reprobate mind and give you over to great delusion so you can
[01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:32.400]  now be a vessel and i look at the people in this film and you can see they're gone there's no one
[01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:40.880]  left there lowest of the low lowest level and this is who they will march out against you in
[01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:45.280]  the public schools you think drag queen story time remember the same people's bed they are
[01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:50.800]  having satanism clubs with your children with them sitting on their laps right now and that's
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:55.440]  what the bathomet statue with the children is all about bathomet destroying the next generation
[01:42:55.440 --> 01:42:56.960]  and it's a celebration of the death of children

[01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:40.240]  there was a big overhaul go ahead and read the hundreds of five star reviews for yourself i've

[01:44:54.320 --> 01:45:03.120]  war store dot com living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is the real drama
[01:45:03.120 --> 01:45:08.640]  can be found here in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island rely on rain water and we
[01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:14.800]  need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles
[01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:21.440]  and acid rain could lower the ph of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of
[01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:28.080]  tests for heavy metals alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy
[01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:33.760]  levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rain water next we tested the water from our alexa
[01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:40.080]  pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the ph was
[01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:46.720]  also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises the ph of
[01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:52.400]  the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rain water
[01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:59.360]  supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it do you realize that when

[01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:38.880]  house here in austin banned pro-life unplanned film still scored number five in the box office but
[01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:42.720]  they helped suppress it and get it out of most theaters that just came out a few months ago
[01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:50.160]  but the movie hail satan a masterpiece of being boring and stupid and predictable but that's
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:54.960]  meant to lure in the pseudo-intellectual to believe they'll be avant-garde if they join
[01:47:55.840 --> 01:48:07.040]  what is a real entry-level method type system this is trailer park satanism with a bunch of
[01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:11.520]  pseudo-intellectuals wearing their anti for sure it's saying they're free speech but viciously
[01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:19.280]  going after everybody else's free speech so i went to saw hill satan and again they say you know
[01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:23.440]  we hate babies we dress up like babies and talk about killing them we want to get rid of babies
[01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:29.600]  it's just classic attack the innocent attack the babies attack the youth attack the future
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:35.760]  and if you type in hail satan into google and click news every article is positive with the
[01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:40.320]  same headlines turns out satanist are the heroes and christians are the bad people turns out
[01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:45.040]  hail satan is spreading satanism across the world and everyone's joining us it's it's the biggest
[01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:52.800]  thing ever it's the democratic party in hollywood attempting to launch a giant rollout of satanism
[01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:55.680]  as if they're the good guys and they're the wonderful people
[01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:06.240]  shows the devil worshipers as good people shows them a glowing reviews again why is that important
[01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:12.640]  they have their free speech to say that but it's not free speech they have a right it's all the same
[01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:17.760]  talking points this morning i looked at like 50 articles i read four or five and it was all the
[01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:22.320]  same three or four different headlines either turns out you learn the bad guys or christians
[01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:27.040]  not the satanist turns out that this is spreading across the world it'll be the new religion
[01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:32.080]  turns out the left you know has become religious under satanist and it's all again tongue in
[01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:36.960]  cheek oh there was the big freak out of the 1980s about the satanism invasion
[01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:44.480]  and heraldo revera and all of it ladies and gentlemen i was living during that period
[01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:49.120]  in one of the wealthiest areas of the country and wherever you get around wealth you find satanism
[01:49:50.240 --> 01:49:54.960]  and the satanist i knew had private jets and helicopters and mark dice had it happen they
[01:49:54.960 --> 01:50:00.480]  were offering him a national tv show with a member of motley crew the motley crew guy wasn't
[01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:06.480]  like this he's actually a pretty good guy and the major director got mark dice in a meeting
[01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:14.480]  room and said uh your christian aren't you sold ice full name he goes yeah he goes yeah uh well
[01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:18.160]  we're gonna give you this national tv show and all this money but we want you to
[01:50:18.800 --> 01:50:26.320]  pronounce jesus christ and we want you to worship lucifer mark says this is a joke the guy said no
[01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:30.480]  i want you to pray with me right now and mark said are you just messing with me to like me
[01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:40.480]  he goes no i'm i'm serious you understand that folks i have known some of the top hollywood people
[01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:44.720]  out there most of them didn't ever want to come on the show so the ones you know about that have
[01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:50.160]  identified with the show is the tip of the iceberg they've told me they said alex they said you're
[01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:57.440]  absolutely right they said about half of hollywood are actual satanist and he said it's a way to
[01:50:57.440 --> 01:51:01.360]  manage people a way to hurt people a way to control people and it's really bad
[01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:12.160]  and folks that's why i can tell you satanism is real it's big and it's powerful and you know i've
[01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:20.960]  told these stories i'm not proud of them but i was growing up in dallas texas and you know i
[01:51:20.960 --> 01:51:24.800]  always looked three or four years older than i was there's pictures of me online folks have dug
[01:51:24.800 --> 01:51:31.600]  up and they go look at jones when he's 20 no that's me at 15 in those photos and i just thought hey
[01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:35.840]  this is great this college girl wants to have sex with me or this the senior in high school beauty
[01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:40.880]  queen you know who lives out at the 20 bedroom mansion with the helicopter pad well after you had
[01:51:40.880 --> 01:51:46.320]  sex with them a couple times you found out that that's not what this is really all about and they
[01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:51.760]  wanted me bad and again there's an interdimensional thing there's a spirit to this those folks didn't
[01:51:51.760 --> 01:51:55.760]  know it wasn't as i was good looking and i wasn't the only one they're trying to recruit but they
[01:51:55.760 --> 01:52:00.880]  wanted me the most and that's because the enemy wants to get people while they're young why do
[01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:05.440]  you think the bathroom that statue shows the children beside bathroom and this is real the
[01:52:05.440 --> 01:52:11.920]  devil's real spirits are real we only see a very narrow spectrum but our mind tunes in to all the
[01:52:11.920 --> 01:52:16.960]  electromagnetics all the different dimensions it's all real and the globalists know this you know i
[01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:24.560]  told joe rogan like two years ago and then again two months ago i said major universities and i listed
[01:52:24.560 --> 01:52:29.200]  them have basically what are like astronaut interdimensional programs where they give people
[01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:37.840]  via ivs even stronger drugs than iowaska and dmt to keep them in the state and they're mapping
[01:52:37.840 --> 01:52:45.440]  these other dimensions and are having meetings with aliens now now this is what i know okay and i
[01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:49.920]  can't get into all the sources and all the things i've told some of it okay but let me just say for
[01:52:49.920 --> 01:52:54.000]  whatever reason kind of cat side that movie where the cat keeps seeing things around its life i mean
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:57.920]  i've just run into all these things throughout my life and i remember hearing these things and
[01:52:57.920 --> 01:53:02.000]  then it noticed he had on a professor and others a few weeks ago and they were announcing news
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:07.840]  articles about major universities are now going to have iv drip dmt you're going to stay in it for
[01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:13.120]  hours and you're going to map the other dimension and they have whole bays of people up to 50 people
[01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:17.760]  usually is the largest group and they all go and have the same experiences so they get on the drugs
[01:53:17.760 --> 01:53:23.440]  and then all of a sudden once they've done it enough and made contact like a holodeck the aliens
[01:53:23.440 --> 01:53:27.440]  show up they're there and they got little horns they're friendly they're little horns though and
[01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:32.720]  and they just they just people say it's like they're out to get us but they tell us stuff and we
[01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:37.360]  learn things and they give us ideas that's where silicon valley came from it's where it all came
[01:53:37.360 --> 01:53:45.200]  from just like god said the devil is a fallen ancient entity imprisoned on this planet and
[01:53:45.200 --> 01:53:51.040]  is testing us and god allows that to happen because we have free will and the devil knows about a
[01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:55.600]  lot of ancient technology that god has built before we're being the image of god and so the
[01:53:55.600 --> 01:54:01.120]  devil doesn't really know how to do it all the devil comes to us and tells us what been done
[01:54:01.120 --> 01:54:08.880]  before you're getting the big deep stuff here folks and so again these are fallen failed entities
[01:54:08.880 --> 01:54:12.640]  that want to see something superior and god's image destroyed that's why these poor fools go
[01:54:12.640 --> 01:54:17.760]  i cut myself i'm totally white uh you know my hair's falling out i i do all these i debase

[01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:33.520]  gave you the planet your children sex enjoyment food fighting loving dancing building we are
[01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:41.600]  superior to satan satan's just old we're babies so you could have mike tyson when he's three years
[01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:47.280]  old and have some little you know 80 pound soul molester trip him up and beat him up but that

[01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:58.800]  difference here so the devil worshipers are real and they want your soul and they are absolutely
[01:54:58.800 --> 01:55:04.240]  running silicon valley and they're pissed that i know it and they're pissed it's come out but i'm

[01:55:26.240 --> 01:55:32.640]  had their souls turned over to this and total dominion to be sucked dry and then they just go

[01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:44.000]  so you look at them and you laugh at them and so all the sucked liberals that are desperate and
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:49.680]  alone and scared like facebook and try to keep them and all by themselves they see a movie glorifying

[02:00:39.040 --> 02:00:45.280]  you don't have to hear it from me that there's been a giant satanic invasion
[02:00:45.280 --> 02:00:51.760]  launched upon humanity it's been brewing it's been building attack families attack christianity
[02:00:52.480 --> 02:00:57.520]  say you can't say mother and father kill babies after they're born send in convicted pedophiles
[02:00:57.520 --> 02:01:03.440]  all over the western world unannounced at schools to have your children sit on their laps this is
[02:01:03.440 --> 02:01:11.280]  pure evil hollywood is is there to destroy your soul destroy your mind to debilitate you to demoralize
[02:01:11.280 --> 02:01:18.800]  you i sent one of our operatives into sundance film festival and in these meetings this year
[02:01:18.800 --> 02:01:23.840]  they admitted we are here to demoralize we are here to pull things down we are here to depress
[02:01:23.840 --> 02:01:30.960]  we are here to destroy and that's what's being funded and that's the plan and films like hail satan
[02:01:31.760 --> 02:01:40.480]  are couched as jokes but in all the press it heralds the new satanic invasion so they tell you
[02:01:40.480 --> 02:01:45.600]  there wasn't a satanic invasion in the eighties which there was but now we are taking over and
[02:01:45.600 --> 02:01:50.160]  we're going to overturn christianity for free speech when the left is all anti free speech
[02:01:50.160 --> 02:01:54.480]  and this very satanic group is anti alex jones and doesn't think i should be on the air
[02:01:56.400 --> 02:02:05.760]  it's all happening at the same time so films like hail satan herald the big coming out
[02:02:05.760 --> 02:02:11.520]  of the satanist and now you see the coming out of the pedophiles and the coming out in college
[02:02:11.520 --> 02:02:16.720]  textbooks saying fetuses are cancer get rid of them fetuses are bad stop venerating babies
[02:02:17.600 --> 02:02:25.600]  women are empowered when they kill their babies this is real selfishness this is real satanism
[02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:33.120]  being brought to you by the most soul sucked minions of the system you could ever imagine
[02:02:33.120 --> 02:02:39.040]  because again those of us that are strong those of us that have will look at people like that and
[02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:44.480]  say i would never want to be involved with a group of people that look like they're diseased and
[02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:52.320]  are about to die being in a movie theater with them i could feel the witness i could feel the
[02:02:52.320 --> 02:03:00.000]  enslavement it was like los angeles had landed in austin and they are invading here the ring
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:07.600]  rights the the soulless zombies the archetype looking for the soul the brain to eat so they
[02:03:07.600 --> 02:03:15.200]  can be human again but it's all couched in pseudo intellectualism delivered to you by
[02:03:15.200 --> 02:03:21.760]  diseased looking crazed ugly people who want to be ugly because they are ugly and they've embraced
[02:03:21.760 --> 02:03:25.040]  it and they're going to bring it to you and they're going to make you eat of it and they're
[02:03:25.040 --> 02:03:30.720]  going to make you absorb it and they're going to conquer you and they're coming and they're here
[02:03:33.520 --> 02:03:40.960]  and they revel in your destruction they revel in their hate of god they revel in their hate of men
[02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:47.520]  and women and that beautiful powerful union so the devil worshipers aren't setting it up with
[02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:53.760]  oh be a white witch and have fun and help people and empower that hasn't worked for them
[02:03:53.760 --> 02:04:01.760]  so now they go right to the deception and say satan is the empower satan is the one that will
[02:04:01.760 --> 02:04:09.440]  give you power satan is the one that will protect you and you're looking at deranged slaves but
[02:04:09.440 --> 02:04:15.680]  remember if you go to a democratic party event the people look dazed they look scared they look
[02:04:15.680 --> 02:04:23.360]  soulless they look like they're lost and that's the high end half of them or the low side are crazed
[02:04:23.360 --> 02:04:32.720]  and screaming and shaking with hatred and they believe that those of you who have the light of
[02:04:32.720 --> 02:04:38.560]  god in your eyes of the enemy and they could simply extinguish that light then they could finally
[02:04:38.560 --> 02:04:46.160]  have power in their search for power they have found the opposite of power they found the dead
[02:04:46.160 --> 02:04:54.480]  space the phantom zone and now their only wish is to take us with them the tentacle reaches out
[02:04:54.480 --> 02:05:00.640]  grabs them they grab for us i've been doing a lot of research into google and youtube censorship
[02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:08.240]  and i've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored the most buried the most
[02:05:08.240 --> 02:05:16.640]  suppressed and that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant leftist
[02:05:16.640 --> 02:05:23.200]  authoritarians like the young turds and others get so butt hurt when trump won they don't want us to
[02:05:23.200 --> 02:05:29.680]  have that victory they don't want us to remember what political action did and that's why the globalist
[02:05:29.680 --> 02:05:35.520]  hillary and others are trying to shut in fours now this is a fight about taking your speech away
[02:05:35.520 --> 02:05:42.400]  not just my speech about taking your very sovereignty away this country is in a war so again i want to
[02:05:42.400 --> 02:05:46.320]  thank you for what you've done but i want to remind you if you don't spread the articles and videos
[02:05:46.320 --> 02:05:51.040]  and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us and the 360 win we're dead in
[02:05:51.040 --> 02:06:06.720]  the water i'm in your hands you're in my hands info war store dot com thank you
[02:06:06.720 --> 02:06:24.400]  the alex jones show because there is a war on or you'll mind
[02:06:29.520 --> 02:06:34.560]  i want them shut down i want them silent i want them muted i think they are horrible for our society
[02:06:34.560 --> 02:06:41.040]  banning people they're dictating the opinions that everyone on the platform is allowed to have merely
[02:06:44.560 --> 02:06:48.640]  i'm a conservative jew so i guess that makes me such a dangerous person
[02:06:51.760 --> 02:06:55.040]  spreading articles spreading videos spreading links you're going to get demonized you're going
[02:06:55.040 --> 02:07:02.560]  to get attacked that's going to do something terrible like help trump get reelected that's
[02:07:02.560 --> 02:07:15.200]  really what all this is about say that they did our content and our brand is the right to be
[02:07:15.200 --> 02:07:22.000]  due and say whatever you want it's about freedom of expression on the journalists and the left
[02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:25.520]  not interested in telling the truth about me because i don't fit the stereotype
[02:07:27.840 --> 02:07:32.160]  they could say whatever they think and i respect their constitution right to do it i hope they
[02:07:32.160 --> 02:07:42.800]  respect my country
[02:07:48.080 --> 02:07:54.800]  you're next
[02:07:56.240 --> 02:08:00.480]  they're keeping babies alive after they're born and harvesting their organs
[02:08:00.480 --> 02:08:06.000]  i first told you that 10 years ago i gave specifics i named the hospitals
[02:08:07.280 --> 02:08:13.120]  since then there's been criminal convictions indictments and lawsuits now five states in the
[02:08:13.120 --> 02:08:18.240]  last six months have passed laws keep babies alive and definitely harvest their organs
[02:08:19.520 --> 02:08:25.120]  no this isn't some imaginary carpenter halloween movie this is the real world
[02:08:25.120 --> 02:08:29.440]  because the devil's greatest trick was convincing the world he didn't exist
[02:08:30.640 --> 02:08:34.880]  i'm not trying to cliffhanger people i always get about 10 minutes behind on a broadcast
[02:08:35.840 --> 02:08:40.000]  and i have dan lineman joining me in the next segment he'll be on for a couple segments
[02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:45.920]  and i said at the start of this hour i would cover this big story but because i heard that
[02:08:45.920 --> 02:08:50.240]  little two-minute piece i've got some other news i want to hit i'm going to do it in the last
[02:08:50.240 --> 02:08:55.760]  segment of the hour but i will get to it and and you know i don't do this on purpose but it is good
[02:08:55.760 --> 02:09:04.240]  to build something up this is so big i was told this a couple years ago i was told us again last
[02:09:04.240 --> 02:09:13.360]  year i was told us again this year and i got documents confirming it that i'm not allowed to
[02:09:13.360 --> 02:09:22.080]  obviously show you sometimes when i get documents i'm giving them i'm told i can't show them but
[02:09:22.080 --> 02:09:33.440]  this is really incredible and the reason i'm going to hold off is i got busy during those segments
[02:09:33.440 --> 02:09:37.680]  and didn't print some of these other articles that i want to have go with this because there's also
[02:09:37.680 --> 02:09:43.520]  some mainstream news where this has been admitted like you've seen the headlines silicon valley
[02:09:45.120 --> 02:09:50.720]  moderators groups that fight hate the southern part we lost center people
[02:09:52.080 --> 02:09:57.920]  like 70 000 i'm trained total now 20 000 facebook alone 30 000 well there's 20 000 at google 10 000
[02:09:57.920 --> 02:10:03.120]  at youtube and they're spanning in these quote human rights boards they're even gonna be in master
[02:10:03.120 --> 02:10:07.200]  cards announcing it i mean just everywhere you go they'll be there to say you don't get food you
[02:10:07.200 --> 02:10:12.560]  don't come in cosco you don't get a bank account and then if you give in to them what will that be like
[02:10:13.760 --> 02:10:18.320]  just always more more more this is flaming authoritarianism this is global corporate
[02:10:18.320 --> 02:10:26.560]  government taking over that's what the new world order is it's illegal it's criminal it's dangerous
[02:10:27.680 --> 02:10:31.360]  and sure if you want to argue it isn't illegal which it is oh it's a private company then change
[02:10:31.360 --> 02:10:40.560]  the damn law because it's dangerous you know back in the days of petty roosevelt was a pretty good
[02:10:40.560 --> 02:10:50.720]  president he said the railroads won't let their competition pay to ship their own fruit or their
[02:10:50.720 --> 02:10:58.640]  own cattle when there's room that's a monopoly we're gonna break that up he told northern pacific
[02:10:58.640 --> 02:11:05.680]  and all of them you're gonna ship people's products or i'm gonna have your ass arrested
[02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:12.800]  that's a private business they can do whatever they want the big railroads advertised they got
[02:11:12.800 --> 02:11:17.520]  open land they got all the exemptions they got liability protection to open up the west and
[02:11:17.520 --> 02:11:22.000]  have commerce and then once they had the railroads coast to coast they started saying there's even
[02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:26.240]  like a gun smoke on it i saw once that's based on true stories where they want to ship the peaches
[02:11:26.240 --> 02:11:33.520]  a thousand miles and the kids dad's died i'm going from memory the kids dad's died was it a gun
[02:11:33.520 --> 02:11:37.520]  smoker was it a bonanza but you read history books that's all over the place and then you know
[02:11:37.520 --> 02:11:41.280]  where they louis lemore and others and you know you've got those ideas they're in those western
[02:11:41.280 --> 02:11:45.200]  books they're fiction none of that stuff's fiction they've just gone and rewritten old newspaper
[02:11:45.200 --> 02:11:54.320]  articles they went and found the library and want to ship your peaches that old western
[02:11:54.320 --> 02:11:59.920]  i guess dad had died his mom had died he wanted to keep the little farm and the big local corrupt
[02:11:59.920 --> 02:12:03.840]  guy wanted to take it because it had watering holes on it or whatever and then he goes to the
[02:12:03.840 --> 02:12:11.600]  railroad and makes a deal whether they won't ship his peaches the thousand miles so he can make the
[02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:18.160]  money to save his farm but the end he loads them up in a wagon takes him a month or so to get there
[02:12:18.160 --> 02:12:22.560]  the guy sends bandits to stop him but they get stopped and then when he gets there he thinks
[02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:28.160]  all the peaches are dead and rotten but under the first layer all the peaches are alive pretty good
[02:12:28.160 --> 02:12:36.960]  story the peaches are still still not bad they're still ripening and see those are real stories
[02:12:36.960 --> 02:12:44.640]  though that isn't just gun smoke or bonanza that you're watching that isn't just gun smoke or
[02:12:44.640 --> 02:12:49.280]  bonanza that you're sitting there looking at this is the real world folks we're seeing in and i'll
[02:12:49.280 --> 02:12:53.840]  go back to this not because i don't have 150 articles or more in 30 or 40 incredible video
[02:12:53.840 --> 02:13:00.240]  clips to play you and a guest waiting in the wings see it in went on last weekend and said
[02:13:00.240 --> 02:13:03.440]  we want alex jones to not be able to use his telephone
[02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:13.040]  and they had a new york post headline should alex jones be able to use the telephone
[02:13:13.040 --> 02:13:22.480]  you see because once you say in a big telecommunications system people can't say somebody's name
[02:13:22.480 --> 02:13:27.920]  of their website it's the sky's the limit and of course big tech wants to tell you where you can go
[02:13:27.920 --> 02:13:32.080]  and what you can do and what you can say and where's our teddy roosevelt
[02:13:34.720 --> 02:13:40.960]  to say you've made billions of dollars back at that time trillions in today's numbers
[02:13:40.960 --> 02:13:46.560]  you've got more money than god more money than any royalty in the world jp morgan chase
[02:13:48.160 --> 02:13:58.400]  norther pacific union pacific standard oil rocker fellers and you won't ship building
[02:13:58.400 --> 02:14:08.560]  supplies to companies you don't like in san francisco you won't ship steam engines to people
[02:14:08.560 --> 02:14:14.800]  you you you've got intelligence officers with guns assassins pinkerton men going around
[02:14:14.800 --> 02:14:18.320]  surveilling everybody that comes up trying to ship something and finding out and then
[02:14:18.320 --> 02:14:22.880]  charging them two three times if you let them ship it that's not america and you're not pulling that
[02:14:22.880 --> 02:14:32.320]  crap this is an antitrust issue and trump needs to do something right now and you need to do
[02:14:32.320 --> 02:14:38.480]  something right now again ladies and gentlemen so many people coming they say alex i'm sorry
[02:14:38.480 --> 02:14:44.080]  you've gone through all this how are you taking it um i'm a leader i'm not bragging everything
[02:14:44.080 --> 02:14:50.960]  but i mean i i adapt and overcome combat model opt for myself sufficiency just like other americans
[02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:58.240]  and i'm not gonna sit here and worry about me i'll i'll do okay no matter what happens
[02:14:58.240 --> 02:15:02.640]  but you think about everybody else with this control system a bunch of followers with a system
[02:15:02.640 --> 02:15:06.160]  that's going to totally control their life and tell them what they can say and what they can do
[02:15:06.160 --> 02:15:12.000]  and then the end game of these people is horrible control and enslavement and dumbing down for social
[02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:18.960]  engineering if you think people are dumb and evil and stupid now you haven't seen anything yet

[02:21:03.520 --> 02:21:08.640]  lot of articles at your up boars.com they're exclusively there brussels buses to spend service
[02:21:08.640 --> 02:21:16.160]  to no go station shouting malaria tb outbreak so malaria tb that's really never been there especially
[02:21:16.160 --> 02:21:21.040]  malaria but now it's there just like all the diseases pouring over in the united states and
[02:21:21.040 --> 02:21:25.520]  the ellis island days they checked everybody for a few months at least not now dan lineman thanks
[02:21:25.520 --> 02:21:31.520]  for joining us from europe alex how you doing good man wow you've got so much you've been covering
[02:21:31.520 --> 02:21:35.680]  the last few weeks that you've been on with us people got to check europe wars.com every day
[02:21:35.680 --> 02:21:40.640]  tell us what's happening yeah it's never never a dull moment as you were just mentioning one of
[02:21:40.640 --> 02:21:46.080]  our latest stories is out of brussels but i think it ties into the larger situation here so what
[02:21:46.080 --> 02:21:50.720]  we have is this is station in brussels it's one of their busiest stations the most important ones in
[02:21:50.720 --> 02:21:54.880]  the city we've been covering the situation that's been going on there for about a year now at this
[02:21:54.880 --> 02:22:00.160]  point because it's basically been turned into a de facto migrant camp and the migrants are living
[02:22:00.160 --> 02:22:05.520]  in a park nearby when the weather is good and they're also sleeping in this train station and things
[02:22:05.520 --> 02:22:10.000]  continue to get worse and worse and the local media there and local politicians are all saying
[02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:14.480]  what is going on here and now we've reached a point where the bus drivers are no longer going to
[02:22:14.480 --> 02:22:20.240]  stop there the unions have decided because there is an outbreak of diseases including malaria
[02:22:20.240 --> 02:22:25.680]  tuberculosis and scabies and that's just reported the officials that are involved in the government
[02:22:25.680 --> 02:22:29.840]  there are trying to downplay this and they said oh there's no evidence of that but the unions say
[02:22:29.840 --> 02:22:35.520]  that they've gotten this information directly from police so it just comes out today just after
[02:22:35.520 --> 02:22:40.320]  we published that story that the cleaning staff that work at this train station are now going to be
[02:22:40.320 --> 02:22:46.080]  vaccinated for a variety of different diseases including a variety of hepatitis strains and so
[02:22:46.640 --> 02:22:50.400]  they're also downplaying this one and saying oh that you know there's no there's nobody that's
[02:22:50.400 --> 02:22:54.800]  been infected we're just doing this as a precautionary measure but I think that this ties into the
[02:22:54.800 --> 02:23:00.480]  larger situation we have this measles outbreak that's just exploding across the US and Europe right
[02:23:00.480 --> 02:23:07.440]  now and then talk of forced mandatory vaccinations with fines if not in many countries and then of
[02:23:07.440 --> 02:23:13.680]  course we had in in New York City we had a total moratorium on people who were unvaccinated going
[02:23:13.680 --> 02:23:19.760]  on in public so I think what we're seeing here is now the the health effects of of the immigration
[02:23:19.760 --> 02:23:25.360]  crisis migration crisis that is affecting the west at this time and of course it's we the people the
[02:23:25.360 --> 02:23:33.600]  citizens of these countries that pay the price I'll tell you Dan these are big biohazard sites
[02:23:33.600 --> 02:23:38.560]  and the border patrols come out and said we've got drug resistant tuberculosis we've got scabies
[02:23:38.560 --> 02:23:43.200]  we've got bubonic plague making come back leprosy we've got people we can't even check it's being
[02:23:43.200 --> 02:23:47.840]  let in put on democratic party buses and just shipped into god knows where and when Trump says
[02:23:47.840 --> 02:23:52.000]  fine we'll ship them to only blue cities Cory Booker and others said no no don't do that that's
[02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:57.840]  dangerous exactly you know I have relatives a lot of my relatives came from overseas and they
[02:23:57.840 --> 02:24:02.080]  they immigrated to the United States and they all tell me about the procedure that they had to go
[02:24:02.080 --> 02:24:05.840]  through when they came and this wasn't even that long ago for some of them where you had to provide
[02:24:05.840 --> 02:24:12.560]  x-rays of your lungs in order to even kind of be checked out at all to check for tuberculosis
[02:24:12.560 --> 02:24:16.800]  and all of these measures seem to have just been thrown out the window for all these people who
[02:24:16.800 --> 02:24:21.280]  want to come here from the third world and there is no concern for what they might be bringing with
[02:24:21.280 --> 02:24:28.240]  them. The larger plan I mean the UN admits this is meant to bankrupt things it's a clowered and
[02:24:28.240 --> 02:24:33.040]  pivot operation on paper they say it's just replacement migration with 80 90 percent of
[02:24:33.040 --> 02:24:37.440]  people not getting jobs staying on welfare giant no-go zones everywhere well just a few years ago
[02:24:37.440 --> 02:24:43.520]  Dan they denied the no-go zones tell folks that don't know what a no-go zone is. Yeah I've been
[02:24:43.520 --> 02:24:50.160]  in them myself I actually reported one from one last year in Italy just to give people an idea I
[02:24:50.160 --> 02:24:55.040]  mean you go into these areas yes technically you can go into them you're not allowed to go into them
[02:24:55.040 --> 02:25:01.200]  but you do risk you do risk anything from from a robbery to your to your own life depending
[02:25:01.200 --> 02:25:06.320]  on how bad the zone is and how fearful the police are of going in them I've been in them in Paris
[02:25:06.320 --> 02:25:12.480]  I've been in them in in Hamburg Germany I've been in them in Italy last year during one of our reports
[02:25:12.480 --> 02:25:17.600]  and these areas are basically areas where the police won't go or they're afraid to go or they're
[02:25:17.600 --> 02:25:22.320]  just afraid afraid to enforce the law and I would say that at this point there are areas of
[02:25:22.320 --> 02:25:29.520]  places like Portland Oregon which are also becoming lawless areas because of people like Antifa who
[02:25:29.520 --> 02:25:34.400]  are just basically they're running the show there and and if people want to you know these things
[02:25:34.400 --> 02:25:39.600]  are going on the United States as well of course in San Francisco Los Angeles the sanctuary city
[02:25:39.600 --> 02:25:44.560]  some of the areas where the law is just not being enforced no I agree and where does this this
[02:25:44.560 --> 02:25:50.560]  raw exercise of power come like a sacrament of a leftist city that there's feces everywhere
[02:25:50.560 --> 02:25:54.400]  needles everywhere homeless people we can roll some of the report over air from skid row we're
[02:25:54.400 --> 02:25:59.680]  going to be airing soon so that'd be a roll maybe I mean it's just crazy that everywhere the lefts
[02:25:59.680 --> 02:26:05.600]  in control a literal nightmare ensues well what's their in game that's a good question I think first
[02:26:05.600 --> 02:26:11.200]  of all it allows for easy you know easy to control and the people that live in these areas the people
[02:26:11.200 --> 02:26:15.520]  that you know like the woman that was on I think you covered this story recently but her family
[02:26:15.520 --> 02:26:21.440]  had owned a business in Los Angeles for over 100 years and now this woman is basically at the mercy
[02:26:21.440 --> 02:26:26.560]  of of her of herself at this point because there's no one that is looking out for her that she said
[02:26:26.560 --> 02:26:32.000]  there was like one police officer that's able to help sometimes but it is basically the effect
[02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:37.760]  where we're just being overwhelmed by people who have no respect for the law defecating in the streets
[02:26:38.400 --> 02:26:43.280]  assaults rapes I mean it depends on how bad the area that it is but it's happening across Europe
[02:26:43.280 --> 02:26:48.800]  and the United States as well and and the of course the officers are either ordered to stand down
[02:26:48.800 --> 02:26:53.680]  or they're just totally overwhelmed and that's okay with the socialists who are in charge because
[02:26:53.680 --> 02:26:58.480]  it just makes easier for them to take control of everything and to demand more money throughout the
[02:26:58.480 --> 02:27:02.960]  situation which of course never really gets thrown at the situation it goes into their pockets and
[02:27:02.960 --> 02:27:14.400]  their buddies so yeah I mean this is just a situation that we're you know watching
[02:27:14.400 --> 02:27:19.200]  play out across Europe it's incredible I did spend a lot of time in the last couple of months here
[02:27:19.200 --> 02:27:24.400]  traveling in some lesser known parts of Europe that that aren't quite as affected by the the
[02:27:24.400 --> 02:27:29.360]  globalist situation these the not major cities some of them are islands where you know they haven't
[02:27:29.360 --> 02:27:35.040]  been as affected and it's such a night and day difference when you go to these places as compared
[02:27:35.040 --> 02:27:41.040]  to when you go to places like Paris and London and Stockholm it's just there's still little
[02:27:41.040 --> 02:27:46.560]  remnants of Europe where you can you can go and you can still feel what it was like back in the
[02:27:46.560 --> 02:27:52.480]  day before we had this just migration wave and and just rampant socialism that is that is sucking a
[02:27:52.480 --> 02:27:57.120]  lot of these cities dry and of course that's what's driving the protests in France now at this point
[02:27:57.120 --> 02:28:01.280]  and the bargaining protests that are happening across Europe for a variety of reasons well let's
[02:28:01.280 --> 02:28:06.320]  talk about that thousands over a thousand 200 churches burned the last few years in Europe
[02:28:06.320 --> 02:28:11.040]  800 plus in France that's the epicenter of the Islamic takeover celebration by Islam of this
[02:28:11.040 --> 02:28:16.320]  we come back I want to get into the German president saying let's just ban anybody that
[02:28:16.320 --> 02:28:20.320]  criticizes what we're doing so now they're even calling you Nazis are hateful they're just saying
[02:28:20.320 --> 02:28:27.440]  ban everybody period and this is their takeover what is their end game what do they do
[02:28:27.440 --> 02:28:33.680]  well there's another 10 20 million military aged Muslim men with no jobs who adopted a gangbanger
[02:28:33.680 --> 02:28:38.560]  culture burning cars every night raping and killing people running whores what happens when

[02:33:20.640 --> 02:33:29.440]  it's alex jones all right dan lineman is a smart investigative journalist writes amazing articles
[02:33:29.440 --> 02:33:33.920]  as incredible reports on the street very dangerous places all over europe is an american
[02:33:34.960 --> 02:33:42.240]  of his wife in europe but let me ask you this twofold i almost feel like we're helping the system
[02:33:42.240 --> 02:33:47.600]  just a laundry list every day of the black plague and the diseases and the murder and the thousands
[02:33:47.600 --> 02:33:55.840]  of burning cars and the freedom vans running over families and the bombings and instead of asking
[02:33:55.840 --> 02:34:00.880]  why is the political system doing this and we know why they want to get rid of western culture
[02:34:00.880 --> 02:34:06.240]  because it's not authoritarian and big mega corporations are just smashing people into
[02:34:06.240 --> 02:34:11.040]  poverty and they want dependence that's the end game but you've got to tell people how what's
[02:34:11.040 --> 02:34:16.240]  happening is bad but you also have to tell them why it's happening and i think all of us myself
[02:34:16.240 --> 02:34:22.000]  included don't spend enough time on replacement migration cloward and piven the larger reason
[02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:27.600]  why this is happening and where that end game is so that's two questions for you then i have a third
[02:34:27.600 --> 02:34:32.560]  question when i'll get out before i forget it how is europe and the corrupt globalist that run at
[02:34:32.560 --> 02:34:38.400]  the the dictatorial e you responding to this i mean i know how they are responding to it
[02:34:38.400 --> 02:34:43.840]  with draconian authoritarianism and then by trump not standing up to this he's created a vacuum
[02:34:43.840 --> 02:34:48.160]  and so social media here that operates in europe and china is adopting their authoritarian model
[02:34:48.160 --> 02:34:54.640]  i mean this is a unbelievable collapse not just the borders but of our free speech right i'll
[02:34:54.640 --> 02:34:59.840]  start with your your last question first because i think that one that you know it's really easy
[02:34:59.840 --> 02:35:04.320]  to get down on trump with certain situations especially what's going on at the southern border
[02:35:05.200 --> 02:35:09.520]  and you know there are other things that we wish promises we wish that he would fulfill
[02:35:09.520 --> 02:35:15.040]  however um you know we can't place all of the of the blame on him or you know the weight of
[02:35:15.040 --> 02:35:18.960]  our entire movement on his shoulders because he's only one man yes we want him to do more about
[02:35:18.960 --> 02:35:23.440]  internet censorship he should focus on that now and what's going on at the border however i think
[02:35:23.440 --> 02:35:29.120]  one of the most important effects of trump that is just been a spilloff from him and of course
[02:35:29.120 --> 02:35:34.240]  brexit before him is what's happening in europe politically and the people that are starting
[02:35:34.240 --> 02:35:40.480]  to feel more comfortable uh raising their voices uh you know in uh on internet comment boards and uh
[02:35:40.480 --> 02:35:45.760]  you know at the at the ballot box at this point because one of the phenomenons in europe that is
[02:35:45.760 --> 02:35:50.320]  so uh that i guess is a little bit different than what's in the the way it works in the us
[02:35:50.320 --> 02:35:56.000]  is that there is kind of a shame culture here especially in northern europe if you if you speak
[02:35:56.000 --> 02:36:02.000]  you know against the status quo then you are you will be attacked by friends family even more
[02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:07.360]  aggressively here i've noticed than than in the us uh and so that keeps people quiet that keeps
[02:36:07.360 --> 02:36:11.440]  people quiet at work that keeps them quiet uh when they're talking to friends and family unless
[02:36:11.440 --> 02:36:16.480]  they're with a very very sure there's that well known ice age incredible conformity where so many
[02:36:16.480 --> 02:36:20.080]  things they've done a bad job they go commit suicide uh how do you get people out of that
[02:36:20.080 --> 02:36:24.480]  cult brainwashing i mean i mean that that is cultural but but it's well known that northern
[02:36:24.480 --> 02:36:28.560]  europeans people thought germans followed orders i mean northern europeans particularly just follow
[02:36:28.560 --> 02:36:34.000]  orders it can be dangerous yeah you know i lived in iceland for a while and it was just so oppressive
[02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:38.640]  there there's no no counterthink there there's nothing expressed and if you did i mean it was
[02:36:38.640 --> 02:36:44.560]  like the piranhas were on you instantaneously but i think that unfortunately what it has taken
[02:36:44.560 --> 02:36:51.760]  is basically turning the entire society on its head and the rape after the muslims on average
[02:36:51.760 --> 02:36:55.120]  do whatever the hell they want i mean i see articles where the judge goes well you're a
[02:36:55.120 --> 02:36:59.360]  muslim you're allowed to rape an eight-year-old girl and well you you you physically assaulted
[02:36:59.360 --> 02:37:05.200]  12 women in one week and amidst you but i'm gonna let you go for community service right exactly
[02:37:05.200 --> 02:37:08.960]  and i saw that i saw a story on europe war is well like a week ago i never covered on air
[02:37:08.960 --> 02:37:14.800]  where he just ran around sticking his hands in women's pants at grocery stores and in penetrating
[02:37:14.800 --> 02:37:18.560]  and i don't get into details and the government just said well that's okay you're a muslim
[02:37:19.840 --> 02:37:24.240]  and things like that are happening so often that they're almost not even worth covering
[02:37:24.240 --> 02:37:28.240]  not because that they're not important but there are there are worse things happening
[02:37:28.240 --> 02:37:33.200]  and there's just so much of it here and it's rampant so why are the leftist judges fetishizing
[02:37:33.200 --> 02:37:39.120]  it i mean they obviously like it well that that that your guess is as good as mine but i think a
[02:37:39.120 --> 02:37:44.240]  lot of these people in general just as perverse or they are happy with seeing society crumble they
[02:37:44.240 --> 02:37:49.440]  want to see it burn you know i had a friend visiting and you know not going to say where from but
[02:37:49.440 --> 02:37:55.600]  it was his first time in europe europe proper and he was shocked by some of the things he had seen
[02:37:55.600 --> 02:38:00.400]  in in around in italy particularly and just uh just the way that the migrants have taken over
[02:38:00.400 --> 02:38:04.720]  there and he asked me you know he's kind of an or me and he said why why would they let this happen
[02:38:04.720 --> 02:38:10.320]  like what's the benefit and i said you know some people if you look at some of these these people
[02:38:10.320 --> 02:38:15.120]  they just love ugliness they like to watch it burn they want to see society go you know down the
[02:38:15.120 --> 02:38:20.480]  trench revolution said it was for freedom then they had a nine-day work week changed the calendar
[02:38:20.480 --> 02:38:24.400]  so we want to pull down everything we want collapse we want ugliness it's what uh
[02:38:24.400 --> 02:38:29.120]  winston smith talks about 1984 how the real goal of the party was ugliness and the collapse of
[02:38:29.120 --> 02:38:34.960]  humanity a boot stomping on a human face forever right exactly the collapse of humanity and and
[02:38:34.960 --> 02:38:39.680]  you see what a great uh you know microcosm of the whole thing is the way that they're trying to
[02:38:39.680 --> 02:38:45.200]  destroy the Notre Dame cathedral even worse than it has been already by just the way that they want
[02:38:45.200 --> 02:38:50.640]  to rebuild it just to spite uh traditionalism and just to spite people who would like to see it return
[02:38:50.640 --> 02:38:55.040]  to its former glory in the way that it was built previously you know that now they're talking about
[02:38:55.040 --> 02:39:00.240]  putting uh uh eco-friendly ceiling a roof on the on the church so that it can generate power for
[02:39:00.240 --> 02:39:06.080]  the city just madness and talking about spires glass fires and even uh you know an architect
[02:39:06.080 --> 02:39:12.000]  talking about putting on a uh uh islamic minaret on top so it's so yeah the left kitty mountain said
[02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:17.040]  let's let's let's let's make an anti-question it's all about conquering the greatness it's about
[02:39:17.040 --> 02:39:22.080]  because they never produce anything the left and so they believe they conquer it that gives them the
[02:39:22.080 --> 02:39:27.680]  power like a headhunter thinks eating somebody's liver gives them the power right and ultimately
[02:39:27.680 --> 02:39:34.080]  most of these people will be um they will succumb to to what's coming if they allow the society to
[02:39:34.080 --> 02:39:40.080]  continue spiraling out of control the way it is um so uh you know your guess is as good as mine as to
[02:39:40.080 --> 02:39:45.200]  why some of these people what their motivation is but i think it's just the nature of pure evil
[02:39:45.200 --> 02:39:51.520]  and the desire to see the the christian um heritage of europe destroyed and everything that it brought
[02:39:51.520 --> 02:39:56.800]  good to the continent and that threatens the globalist ai takeover christianity real christianity

[02:45:57.840 --> 02:46:04.240]  force is great i want to say turbo force is amazing it is but if you took it with fish oil it's like
[02:46:04.240 --> 02:46:09.040]  the fish oil is it the fish oil is better than it and that's an example of what i'm talking about
[02:46:09.040 --> 02:46:15.440]  fish oil is liquid energy brain body heart the cleanest the best out there you've got the
[02:46:15.440 --> 02:46:19.360]  children's you've got the adults you've got the krill oil if you're going to get the full effect the
[02:46:19.360 --> 02:46:23.360]  fish oil and the children's are really strong they don't give you the burpees but krill oil is
[02:46:23.360 --> 02:46:27.440]  the best and it'll give you the damn burps and i'm sorry you want something like this you don't
[02:46:27.440 --> 02:46:32.480]  get stuff for free the krill is hallucinogenic it's so good in my view i'm not a medical statement
[02:46:32.480 --> 02:46:36.560]  here but let me tell you something i eat five culottes of krill oil before i go to bed i'm
[02:46:36.560 --> 02:46:48.080]  seeing santa claus that night so your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is so we don't
[02:46:48.080 --> 02:46:52.080]  make a big profit off of it but you notice i just obsessed because whatever the best is we've got
[02:46:52.080 --> 02:47:08.000]  i just can't lie to you i just can't do it you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:47:22.800 --> 02:47:42.000]  do
[02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:55.400]  Okay, this is the M4, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:47:55.400 --> 02:47:59.640]  So they sit there and they demonize us, they lie about us, thousands of articles a month,
[02:47:59.640 --> 02:48:04.440]  hundreds of TV shows a month, a conservative just saying horrible things, never showing
[02:48:04.440 --> 02:48:08.840]  you a clip of me saying it, they just do it, they have no respect for you, they just churn
[02:48:08.840 --> 02:48:15.080]  out these lies, and then corporate America kicks you off your bank accounts, you get
[02:48:15.080 --> 02:48:20.560]  kicked off social media, you get treated like you're a Jew in Nazi Germany, that's a good
[02:48:20.560 --> 02:48:24.560]  historical parallel to what's happening.
[02:48:24.560 --> 02:48:29.080]  And so years ago I began to learn that one big reason they wanted to go to AI computers
[02:48:29.080 --> 02:48:34.120]  doing censorship, which more and more they're doing, is because humans that have to listen
[02:48:34.120 --> 02:48:39.440]  to shows like this at Facebook and Twitter and Google and places and YouTube and censor
[02:48:39.440 --> 02:48:46.360]  it, well they get radicalized, you see, they actually tune in and hear what we have to
[02:48:46.360 --> 02:48:54.520]  say versus what mainstream media is saying about us and what the corporate system is
[02:48:54.520 --> 02:48:57.880]  saying about us.
[02:48:57.880 --> 02:49:03.160]  And so PBS put out a report a few days ago, we're going to play some clips of it right
[02:49:03.160 --> 02:49:09.840]  now, and notice the attack, it's multifaceted here, they talk about snuff films and child
[02:49:09.840 --> 02:49:15.240]  molestation, lots of stuff the Democrats are into, and they talk about oh the terrible
[02:49:15.240 --> 02:49:20.080]  stuff Facebook has to go through, and you see the articles about Facebook employees
[02:49:20.080 --> 02:49:27.080]  that have to moderate while they get PTSD, having to listen to the conspiracy theorists.
[02:49:27.080 --> 02:49:31.600]  And then they talk about oh why we have to follow them around and watch what they're
[02:49:31.600 --> 02:49:35.440]  doing, and I've talked to sources inside of these groups, they have PIs that watch them,
[02:49:35.440 --> 02:49:39.720]  they spy on them, and then sometimes like Kanye West got sent to a mental institution
[02:49:39.720 --> 02:49:45.280]  for a week, when he said he liked Trump, sometimes they grab him and bake or act him, because
[02:49:45.280 --> 02:49:48.480]  you know if you decide hey we shouldn't be spying on everybody and then lying about it
[02:49:48.480 --> 02:49:52.280]  on the news, hey we shouldn't be controlling what words they can say, hey we're calling
[02:49:52.280 --> 02:49:58.040]  people things they aren't, well then that's their highest turnover, that's the groups
[02:49:58.040 --> 02:50:00.880]  they've got to target, that's the groups they've got to watch.
[02:50:00.880 --> 02:50:07.760]  And so really this is your takeaway to this big segment, is around half the people that
[02:50:07.760 --> 02:50:13.440]  work a year longer in quote moderation that have even been Southern Property Law Center
[02:50:13.440 --> 02:50:16.880]  trained, they were brainwashed for years in college, they were then given a fake template
[02:50:16.880 --> 02:50:22.800]  about us, and then they get into the moderation and they freak out, that's why we get internal
[02:50:22.800 --> 02:50:26.760]  Google documents about how we're targeted last year, that's how this happens, and I
[02:50:26.760 --> 02:50:29.680]  knew a lot of those, I talked to some sources that said this, Mike Cernovich has said it
[02:50:29.680 --> 02:50:35.400]  on my show, he's out there with a lot of these folks, they love us inside Google and Facebook
[02:50:35.400 --> 02:50:39.920]  and Twitter, a lot of the people, but they have to be closeted libertarians, most are
[02:50:39.920 --> 02:50:45.200]  conservatives, they're libertarians, and have to hide around all the crazy SJWs who are
[02:50:45.200 --> 02:50:52.440]  super low IQ, super aggressive, super hateful, and always accusing them of sexism or racism
[02:50:52.440 --> 02:50:57.400]  or weird stuff, so they're in the cult, and they want out of the cult, and there's shows
[02:50:57.400 --> 02:51:03.360]  that they're tasked with controlling and blocking, and so this is bigger than Alex Jones, it's
[02:51:03.360 --> 02:51:09.040]  bigger than those employees themselves, it's about whistleblowing, and that's what the system
[02:51:09.040 --> 02:51:12.640]  is really scared of, it's whistleblowers on Google and Twitter and Facebook, and the people
[02:51:12.640 --> 02:51:17.440]  that have released the videos, it's in Paul's new article on infowars.com, we can probably
[02:51:17.440 --> 02:51:23.640]  pull that up, I'll show you on my phone actually, we'll do it that way, Facebook calls me dangerous,
[02:51:23.640 --> 02:51:31.440]  imagine my shot, no, really, and if you scroll down the article on infowars.com, for some
[02:51:31.440 --> 02:51:35.320]  reason they've got human events pulled up, I'll just show you my site, I'll just go
[02:51:35.320 --> 02:51:41.640]  to my site, that's quicker and easier for me to do, and I'll just go to the old infowars.com,
[02:51:41.640 --> 02:51:54.000]  hell, I'll just go off here, that's what I'll do, the hug, can I move to Canada, is there
[02:51:54.000 --> 02:52:01.960]  anything positive you see from this election result, oh boy, that's a really tough one
[02:52:01.960 --> 02:52:07.640]  right now, this week Facebook banned several high profile accounts that it says engage
[02:52:07.640 --> 02:52:12.960]  in violence and hate, including white supremacists, nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, and
[02:52:12.960 --> 02:52:17.040]  a number of right wing commentators, including Alex Jones.
[02:52:17.040 --> 02:52:22.560]  In the wake of live streamed attacks and published threats, there are new calls for social media
[02:52:22.560 --> 02:52:26.460]  companies to do more to block extremism and hate.
[02:52:26.460 --> 02:52:31.160]  At Facebook, thousands of real people known as moderators are the front lines of this
[02:52:31.160 --> 02:52:35.120]  battle, looking and listening to some horrific material.
[02:52:35.120 --> 02:52:39.240]  I recently spoke with Casey Newton, Silicon Valley editor for The Verge, who reported
[02:52:39.240 --> 02:52:43.080]  on the toll this content is taking on Facebook moderators.
[02:52:43.080 --> 02:52:47.720]  This is not just in the context of the New Zealand attacks, this is something that is
[02:52:47.720 --> 02:52:52.800]  structurally built in so that basically there are people who see things on Facebook so that
[02:52:52.800 --> 02:52:56.000]  the rest of us don't have to, right?
[02:52:56.000 --> 02:52:59.240]  That's right, anytime you see something on Facebook that you don't like, you can click
[02:52:59.240 --> 02:53:03.520]  a button to report it, and if you do that, a human being will look at it and determine
[02:53:03.520 --> 02:53:07.080]  whether it violates Facebook's community standards or not.
[02:53:07.080 --> 02:53:11.880]  A lot of the stuff they see is benign, but a lot of it is really shocking and disturbing,
[02:53:11.880 --> 02:53:14.760]  and some of that can have a long term toll on their lives.
[02:53:14.760 --> 02:53:18.640]  So what kind of things, without getting too graphic, what kind of things are Facebook
[02:53:18.640 --> 02:53:21.440]  moderators looking at pretty much all day?
[02:53:21.440 --> 02:53:23.720]  It's shift work.
[02:53:23.720 --> 02:53:24.720]  That's right.
[02:53:24.720 --> 02:53:25.720]  I mean...
[02:53:25.720 --> 02:53:26.720]  Let's stop right there.
[02:53:26.720 --> 02:53:30.720]  You've got these poor babies, you've got Casey Newton from The Verge editor that goes around
[02:53:30.720 --> 02:53:34.640]  the police and the internet, and these poor babies have to sit there all day censoring
[02:53:34.640 --> 02:53:39.640]  people, snuff films and child porn, all the stuff the left loves, and then conspiracy
[02:53:39.640 --> 02:53:43.520]  people that question the government, and again, they've got PTSD, and a lot of them end up
[02:53:43.520 --> 02:53:47.920]  believing in the conspiracies, and then they've got to be watched in the cult, you see.
[02:53:47.920 --> 02:53:48.920]  It's all a big cult.
[02:53:48.920 --> 02:53:57.520]  You've got to watch the watchers, like Winston Smith in 1984, here it is.
[02:53:57.520 --> 02:54:01.880]  And sort of every flavor of violence that you can imagine.
[02:54:01.880 --> 02:54:05.760]  They're not actually going out and seeing all the pages that exist on Facebook.
[02:54:05.760 --> 02:54:06.760]  That would be impossible.
[02:54:06.760 --> 02:54:10.480]  So there's, what, an algorithm that's kind of sorting it through and then kind of putting
[02:54:10.480 --> 02:54:13.280]  it up on a silver platter to them?
[02:54:13.280 --> 02:54:14.280]  That's right.
[02:54:14.280 --> 02:54:17.320]  So if you see something you don't like on Facebook, you can click a button to report
[02:54:17.320 --> 02:54:22.640]  it, and all of that goes into a big queue, and then that gets a lot of results.
[02:54:22.640 --> 02:54:26.960]  Yeah, the algorithm is tattletales, saying, I'm offended by this.
[02:54:26.960 --> 02:54:32.480]  I say this is hate, so that a human says they think something's hate, like a baby is a human.
[02:54:32.480 --> 02:54:34.680]  That's actually listed as hate now, and so you get banned.
[02:54:34.680 --> 02:54:35.680]  No, I'm serious.
[02:54:35.680 --> 02:54:36.680]  That's in the news today.
[02:54:36.680 --> 02:54:38.480]  Saying a baby is a human is now hate.
[02:54:38.480 --> 02:54:41.080]  I got it in my stack.
[02:54:41.080 --> 02:54:43.360]  See, they're the gods.
[02:54:43.360 --> 02:54:44.360]  They went to university.
[02:54:44.360 --> 02:54:45.920]  They got four or five degrees.
[02:54:45.920 --> 02:54:47.800]  They talk with a list, but they're weak.
[02:54:47.800 --> 02:54:52.540]  They don't want to have kids, and so they are going to rule you.
[02:54:52.540 --> 02:54:54.760]  They are going to run your life.
[02:54:54.760 --> 02:54:57.200]  They are going to control.
[02:54:57.200 --> 02:55:04.100]  So the algorithm is people complaining, like the Verge, or like Adam, or whatever the damn
[02:55:04.100 --> 02:55:05.760]  Stelter guy's name is.
[02:55:05.760 --> 02:55:06.760]  That's what they're doing.
[02:55:06.760 --> 02:55:07.760]  Here it is.
[02:55:07.760 --> 02:55:08.760]  No particular order.
[02:55:08.760 --> 02:55:10.040]  So they sit down at their desk.
[02:55:10.040 --> 02:55:14.720]  They click a button that says Resume Reviewing inside a custom piece of software that Facebook
[02:55:14.720 --> 02:55:19.960]  has, and then they just start seeing this mass of posts, and some of them will be very
[02:55:19.960 --> 02:55:25.640]  simple bullying, some of them will be very benign, and then some of them will be incredibly
[02:55:25.640 --> 02:55:26.640]  disturbing.
[02:55:26.640 --> 02:55:32.240]  And when you consider the kind of content that they're looking at and how depressing
[02:55:32.240 --> 02:55:37.600]  and upsetting some of that content is, that can put some of them into a very dark place,
[02:55:37.600 --> 02:55:40.680]  where they feel like they don't have anyone that they can talk to.
[02:55:40.680 --> 02:55:45.680]  So I talked to a number of folks who told me that they had developed symptoms that closely
[02:55:45.680 --> 02:55:52.880]  resemble post-traumatic stress disorder, and then in another sort of strange twist, a lot
[02:55:52.880 --> 02:55:58.080]  of the moderators I spoke with said that the more that they reviewed content about sort
[02:55:58.080 --> 02:56:02.680]  of fringe conspiracy theories, the more they themselves came to believe it.
[02:56:02.680 --> 02:56:06.160]  And so a lot of the moderators I've spoken with now believe in some of the conspiracy
[02:56:06.160 --> 02:56:08.920]  theories that they've been asked to moderate.
[02:56:08.920 --> 02:56:13.320]  This is a paragraph from your story I want to quote, the moderator told me, it's a place
[02:56:13.320 --> 02:56:16.680]  where the conspiracy videos and memes that they see each day gradually lead them to embrace
[02:56:16.680 --> 02:56:17.920]  fringe views.
[02:56:17.920 --> 02:56:21.600]  One auditor walks the floor promoting the idea that the earth is flat.
[02:56:21.600 --> 02:56:26.160]  A former employee told me he has begun to question certain aspects of the Holocaust.
[02:56:26.160 --> 02:56:29.920]  Another former employee who told me he has mapped every escape route out of his house
[02:56:29.920 --> 02:56:35.720]  and sleeps with a gun at his side said, quote, I no longer believe 9-11 was a terrorist attack.
[02:56:35.720 --> 02:56:39.400]  And this is a result of the job that they're doing every day.
[02:56:39.400 --> 02:56:45.640]  You might do this job for, you know, 8 weeks, 10 weeks, 12 weeks, making $15 an hour.
[02:56:45.640 --> 02:56:50.760]  You get fired or you leave because it's too upsetting and you're going to then have lasting
[02:56:50.760 --> 02:56:55.120]  psychological trauma, which of course Facebook is not going to pay for you to go get treatment
[02:56:55.120 --> 02:56:56.120]  for that.
[02:56:56.120 --> 02:56:57.120]  That's right.
[02:56:57.120 --> 02:56:58.880]  We can't show you the Muslims raping and killing.
[02:56:58.880 --> 02:56:59.880]  We just have to let them in.
[02:56:59.880 --> 02:57:01.880]  We can't show the open borders with all the disease.
[02:57:01.880 --> 02:57:04.840]  We can't show you the Satanists running around, brainwashing kids.
[02:57:04.840 --> 02:57:07.560]  We can't show you the children being targeted.
[02:57:07.560 --> 02:57:11.160]  And again, they go on to talk about, oh, and some of the people actually start believing
[02:57:11.160 --> 02:57:13.120]  these conspiracy theories, you see.
[02:57:13.120 --> 02:57:16.840]  So it's all just how they're going to take care of everything and you're going to be
[02:57:16.840 --> 02:57:17.840]  on these big platforms.
[02:57:17.840 --> 02:57:19.880]  They're going to control what you can say.
[02:57:19.880 --> 02:57:21.760]  They're going to control what you can do.
[02:57:21.760 --> 02:57:24.320]  They're going to control how you live your lives.
[02:57:24.320 --> 02:57:25.320]  That's how they do it.
[02:57:25.320 --> 02:57:28.400]  And I shouldn't say visit infowars.com or newswars.com.
[02:57:28.400 --> 02:57:29.400]  Who really cares?
[02:57:29.400 --> 02:57:30.400]  You know what I mean?
[02:57:30.400 --> 02:57:31.400]  Nobody really cares anymore.
[02:57:31.400 --> 02:57:35.800]  Everybody's going to watch Netflix until the reactors start melting down and the new war
[02:57:35.800 --> 02:57:36.800]  starts.
[02:57:36.800 --> 02:57:41.360]  It's going to be a huge world war and billions are going to die because humans are weak.
[02:57:41.360 --> 02:57:43.800]  People are stupid and they want to die.
[02:57:43.800 --> 02:57:52.520]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern
[02:57:52.520 --> 02:57:57.280]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.
[02:57:57.280 --> 02:58:02.600]  Faced off hundreds of years of traditional techniques and perfect conditions, we've

[02:58:46.800 --> 02:58:49.200]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[02:58:49.200 --> 02:58:53.000]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your
[02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:55.920]  kids get their EPA and DHA too.
[02:58:55.920 --> 02:59:00.120]  Honor Roll is a powerful DHA fish oil formula for your child.

[02:59:49.480 --> 03:00:05.160]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:05.160 --> 03:00:10.480]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:10.480 --> 03:00:21.000]  Alright, Mike Adams has taken over in the 4th hour, and then the War Room with Owen Schroyer
[03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:22.000]  is coming up.
[03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:26.400]  Just to watch how the globalists turn the sensors that are minding us and lying about
[03:00:26.400 --> 03:00:33.400]  us and controlling us into victims of PTSD, because they have to read the horrible things
[03:00:33.400 --> 03:00:37.080]  us conservatives are saying, and they mix this in with child molesters.
[03:00:37.080 --> 03:00:39.400]  It's what they do, and it's sick.
[03:00:39.400 --> 03:00:43.520]  And they will get defeated, just like they're getting defeated on Russiagate and Spygate
[03:00:43.520 --> 03:00:44.520]  and everything else.
[03:00:44.520 --> 03:00:49.400]  The chickens are coming home to roast, and they will not get away with it.
[03:00:49.400 --> 03:00:51.120]  That's an absolute guarantee.
[03:00:51.120 --> 03:00:56.440]  You know that, I know that, we know that, it's going to happen.
[03:00:56.440 --> 03:01:02.720]  But as Nietzsche said, don't spend too much time looking into the abyss, lest you become
[03:01:02.720 --> 03:01:07.000]  the abyss.
[03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:12.160]  There's really something to just live in our own lives, and doing what we do politically,
[03:01:12.160 --> 03:01:17.240]  but not giving all our time to the system.
[03:01:17.240 --> 03:01:20.720]  Because I'm not, I wouldn't call, I'm not depressed.
[03:01:20.720 --> 03:01:24.600]  I'm sick of looking at John Brennan and James Clapper.
[03:01:24.600 --> 03:01:30.480]  I'm sick of every day seeing more censorship and classical high-tech tyranny taking over
[03:01:30.480 --> 03:01:35.440]  every facet of our lives, and the left, all these slaves of the system who are going to
[03:01:35.440 --> 03:01:39.600]  be thrown away as soon as the AI is fully in place, running around, talking about how
[03:01:39.600 --> 03:01:44.080]  they're for free speech one minute, because Trump's criticizing the press.
[03:01:44.080 --> 03:01:46.040]  Criticizing the press doesn't violate free speech.
[03:01:46.040 --> 03:01:47.480]  It's called free speech.
[03:01:47.480 --> 03:01:49.840]  But then when they want to stop your speech, it's high and mighty.
[03:01:49.840 --> 03:01:51.520]  I'm sick of them.
[03:01:51.520 --> 03:01:55.120]  So I'm not appeasing liberals anymore.
[03:01:55.120 --> 03:01:59.800]  I'm not kissing their ass, and you know, it's a form of virtue signaling, it's a form of
[03:01:59.800 --> 03:02:06.400]  virtue signaling that you've got to make everybody comfortable, and you've got to just act like
[03:02:06.400 --> 03:02:10.320]  if anybody's a woman or a man or they're black or they're white.
[03:02:10.320 --> 03:02:13.480]  If you're black, you've got to act this way around white people, or if you're, if you're
[03:02:13.480 --> 03:02:18.320]  white, you've got to act like this around black people, because, you know, I've sat
[03:02:18.320 --> 03:02:28.120]  there before, when I'm out of people I know and stuff, and then if there's a black person
[03:02:28.120 --> 03:02:32.360]  or they act different, and they don't do it because they're racist or whatever, it's
[03:02:32.360 --> 03:02:37.080]  like a virtue signal, and you understand, those are conservatives do that.
[03:02:37.080 --> 03:02:40.080]  The left does that like a thousand times worse.
[03:02:40.080 --> 03:02:45.720]  It's just, it's this weird mental illness, like you count so much, you're going to act
[03:02:45.720 --> 03:02:51.640]  a certain way for somebody else, because it's a form of hospitality, you know, it's a form
[03:02:51.640 --> 03:02:54.960]  of mental illness.
[03:02:54.960 --> 03:03:04.440]  It's sick, and imagine if you were sitting there, hypothetical story, and you've got
[03:03:04.440 --> 03:03:08.080]  three daughters in a birthday party, and you say, man, I got the best, sweetest daughters
[03:03:08.080 --> 03:03:13.400]  in the world, and then your mom looks at you and says, oh, but your wife's great too.
[03:03:13.400 --> 03:03:16.920]  See how that's SJW, I read about that in the news article.
[03:03:16.920 --> 03:03:22.920]  See how SJW that is, that you can't say your daughters are great without saying your wife's
[03:03:22.920 --> 03:03:28.880]  great, your mother says, and if you want to know liberal programming in the last 50, 60
[03:03:28.880 --> 03:03:30.560]  years, that's what it's like.
[03:03:30.560 --> 03:03:35.720]  No one else can succeed unless others do, but there's no such thing as that.
[03:03:35.720 --> 03:03:44.320]  And so that's the virtue signal, is that everybody gets a participation trophy.
[03:03:44.320 --> 03:03:49.120]  Everybody, and you've got to understand the next level of that is, all the so-called groups,
[03:03:49.120 --> 03:03:53.880]  which is usually weird, method-looking white people, that don't have power because they're
[03:03:53.880 --> 03:04:00.720]  just weak, stupid, lazy, dumb people, neurotic perverts, you've now got to let them run your
[03:04:00.720 --> 03:04:02.960]  life in some new virtue signal.
[03:04:02.960 --> 03:04:08.680]  No, I'm not going to virtue signal anybody more, and I never really did it, but I'm going
[03:04:08.680 --> 03:04:11.440]  to be authentic, and that's the end of it.
[03:04:11.440 --> 03:04:17.320]  Authenticity is what matters, and nothing else anymore, and you know, I'm going to work
[03:04:17.320 --> 03:04:22.000]  as hard as I can to do this peacefully, but we're going to win the peaceful fight, and
[03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:25.560]  the globalists are going to start a violent thing with us.
[03:04:25.560 --> 03:04:32.800]  And so I tell everybody, work for peace, work for peaceful resolutions, work to wake folks
[03:04:32.800 --> 03:04:37.920]  up so we have a bigger number of people that are awake, but have a defense plan for yourself,
[03:04:37.920 --> 03:04:41.280]  and then if they want to get off the porch and start a fight, we're going to give it
[03:04:41.280 --> 03:04:45.280]  to them, and we'll send them to Satan real fast.
[03:04:45.280 --> 03:04:52.280]  They'll be in hell real quick, we'll send them down there and they'll pop up.
[03:05:45.280 --> 03:05:52.280]  Don't live in a polluted major city in your home, have clean air, go to infowarstore.com.
[03:06:15.280 --> 03:06:35.600]  All right, Mike Adams, the health ranger of naturalnews.com is about to take over, but
[03:06:35.600 --> 03:06:41.040]  I want to add an appendum to the hell Satan movie I went and saw last night in Alamo Draft
[03:06:41.040 --> 03:06:42.040]  House, watching Weird.
[03:06:42.040 --> 03:06:50.400]  I'm going to call them a feminine because that insults women, very weak, strange, unnatural
[03:06:50.400 --> 03:06:56.720]  people wiggling around in their chairs thinking they were watching something naughty.
[03:06:56.720 --> 03:07:00.120]  The one thing they got right in the movie was when they talked about how they went to
[03:07:00.120 --> 03:07:05.480]  try to do a black mass by a Catholic church at Harvard, the Catholics came out and massed
[03:07:05.480 --> 03:07:09.320]  by the thousands and said, this is evil, this is bad, and they said, hey, the Catholic
[03:07:09.320 --> 03:07:13.360]  church in the U.S. has abused thousands of young boys and covered it up, and so don't
[03:07:13.360 --> 03:07:14.360]  tell us we're bad.
[03:07:14.360 --> 03:07:17.440]  Well, yeah, that's Satanist getting into the Catholic church doing that.
[03:07:17.440 --> 03:07:19.320]  That's how they really infiltrate and do it.
[03:07:19.320 --> 03:07:23.240]  It turns out many of the abused boys and girls in the Catholic church that's come out in
[03:07:23.240 --> 03:07:31.160]  the police reports were actually abused in black masses carried out inside of the churches.
[03:07:31.160 --> 03:07:33.920]  That's real blasphemy.
[03:07:33.920 --> 03:07:36.760]  So there they were saying, oh, look what Christians do to people.
[03:07:36.760 --> 03:07:42.320]  No, that's being done as Satanists infiltrating Christian and Catholic churches.
[03:07:42.320 --> 03:07:46.920]  But they are able to point at big organized religion and say, oh, that's where the real
[03:07:46.920 --> 03:07:48.860]  evil is.
[03:07:48.860 --> 03:07:53.320]  But again, it's come out of Pennsylvania and many other areas that the priests are getting
[03:07:53.320 --> 03:08:02.400]  altar boys in there at night in black magic rituals and black masses and giving them the
[03:08:02.400 --> 03:08:05.960]  sacraments of, you know what?
[03:08:05.960 --> 03:08:09.680]  And so I wanted to point that out that that's how sick the Satanists are.
[03:08:09.680 --> 03:08:11.880]  It's the Satanists that say kill babies after they're born.
[03:08:11.880 --> 03:08:13.760]  It's the Satanists that say go after unborn babies.
[03:08:13.760 --> 03:08:15.720]  It's the Satanists that are obsessed with all this.
[03:08:15.720 --> 03:08:19.240]  And now they tell you all of the news that though this is your new movement and it's
[03:08:19.240 --> 03:08:24.120]  a pathetic movement of a bunch of jellyfish being promoted in major movies and everywhere
[03:08:24.120 --> 03:08:28.800]  else that you should go join this as the new liberal thing, it's completely and totally
[03:08:28.800 --> 03:08:36.120]  and absolutely out of control at so many levels.
[03:08:36.120 --> 03:08:38.040]  And so this is the fall of society.
[03:08:38.040 --> 03:08:40.080]  Many historians have written about it.
[03:08:40.080 --> 03:08:43.880]  When you have plenty of food, plenty of water, plenty of everything and people just get decadent.
[03:08:43.880 --> 03:08:45.200]  They don't want to work.
[03:08:45.200 --> 03:08:47.800]  They start demanding more and more of the system.
[03:08:47.800 --> 03:08:52.080]  They organize into gangs and then what do a bunch of lazy people that never do any work
[03:08:52.080 --> 03:08:53.080]  want?
[03:08:53.080 --> 03:08:54.280]  They want power.
[03:08:54.280 --> 03:08:56.240]  They want control of the system.
[03:08:56.240 --> 03:08:59.960]  They want to overthrow the system, but they don't want to overthrow the system.
[03:08:59.960 --> 03:09:02.560]  They want to be the system.
[03:09:02.560 --> 03:09:06.160]  And America in many states and areas is satanic now.
[03:09:06.160 --> 03:09:09.480]  In all your major blue states and blue cities, it's about the elites.
[03:09:09.480 --> 03:09:10.680]  It's about the corrupt.
[03:09:10.680 --> 03:09:11.920]  They're all tax-exempt.
[03:09:11.920 --> 03:09:13.320]  They get away with what they want.
[03:09:13.320 --> 03:09:14.720]  They have the power, the control.
[03:09:14.720 --> 03:09:19.560]  Does that mean that the Satanists pointed at a bunch of weird, corrupt, fake Christianoids
[03:09:19.560 --> 03:09:22.320]  that are just there for their own political power and a bunch of hypocrites?
[03:09:22.320 --> 03:09:26.280]  But that then makes the Satanists good because the Christians are fake?
[03:09:26.280 --> 03:09:27.800]  No, it doesn't.
[03:09:27.800 --> 03:09:35.480]  The issue is it's being rolled out en masse against humanity on a huge scale.
[03:09:35.480 --> 03:09:40.000]  And they're saying in every newspaper in the country, the new religion is Satanism because
[03:09:40.000 --> 03:09:45.360]  the Democrats first gets you away from realizing spirituality and tell you there is no God
[03:09:45.360 --> 03:09:46.360]  but yourself humanism.
[03:09:46.360 --> 03:09:51.040]  And they go, by the way, meet the God of humanism, Satan, but actually he's not the
[03:09:51.040 --> 03:09:52.040]  God of humans.
[03:09:52.040 --> 03:09:53.800]  He's the God of your enslavement.
[03:09:53.800 --> 03:09:58.120]  And so that's what I'm saying is whether you believe in God or not, these archetypes,
[03:09:58.120 --> 03:10:00.240]  the establishment is surveilling you.
[03:10:00.240 --> 03:10:02.600]  The establishment is telling you what speech you have.
[03:10:02.600 --> 03:10:04.640]  The establishment is telling you you don't have children.
[03:10:04.640 --> 03:10:06.200]  The establishment is telling you what to do.
[03:10:06.200 --> 03:10:10.120]  I thought the left-hand path was going to give everybody this freedom.
[03:10:10.120 --> 03:10:13.960]  But you look at the left-hand past people, they look like a bunch of dead zombies had
[03:10:13.960 --> 03:10:18.200]  their souls sucked out because that's what they are.
[03:10:18.200 --> 03:10:23.440]  A bunch of nobodies trying to act powerful.
[03:10:23.440 --> 03:10:24.440]  Mike Adams has taken over.
[03:10:24.440 --> 03:10:28.720]  Please don't forget, the way we circumnavigate and override the censorship of big tech that
[03:10:28.720 --> 03:10:34.240]  is now to the next level is your human action and your will.
[03:10:34.240 --> 03:10:38.840]  Infowars.com, NewsWars.com, the free podcast, Infowars.com, of course, let's show, go sign
[03:10:38.840 --> 03:10:42.880]  up for it a couple of clicks, spreading the link, saying this is the remote and transmission.
[03:10:42.880 --> 03:10:44.600]  This is what the system doesn't want you to have.
[03:10:44.600 --> 03:10:49.760]  It's like theaters across the country banned this year and wouldn't let it show that was
[03:10:49.760 --> 03:10:54.800]  number five in theaters unplanned about the beauty of having a baby.
[03:10:54.800 --> 03:10:59.520]  But in this film, they're putting it all in theaters, there's no problem there.
[03:10:59.520 --> 03:11:03.240]  They're saying get rid of your babies, they're bad, empower yourself as a woman, kill your
[03:11:03.240 --> 03:11:05.360]  child, that's in the movie.
[03:11:05.360 --> 03:11:10.920]  And it's all about how they're for free speech and the Christians are trying to stop them.
[03:11:10.920 --> 03:11:16.200]  Oh yeah, it's the left censoring and controlling everywhere.
[03:11:16.200 --> 03:11:20.720]  If the Satanist film didn't get showed in theaters, they'd bitch to complain.
[03:11:20.720 --> 03:11:29.240]  When the Christians get wadded up and thrown in the trash can, it's a private company.
[03:11:29.240 --> 03:11:35.200]  They use our own tolerance and openness against us.
[03:11:35.200 --> 03:11:39.000]  Don't give to colleges that are your alumni of enough of free speech.
[03:11:39.000 --> 03:11:41.280]  Don't eat at restaurants if they're owned by leftist.
[03:11:41.280 --> 03:11:44.040]  They don't want us in the restaurants, they don't want us in their bars, they don't want
[03:11:44.040 --> 03:11:45.040]  us around them.
[03:11:45.040 --> 03:11:48.160]  Good, we don't want to be around you, pull out of them.
[03:11:48.160 --> 03:11:51.760]  They need us, they're the vampires.
[03:11:51.760 --> 03:11:55.560]  They're the ones turned over to evil, they're the fallen.
[03:11:55.560 --> 03:11:58.880]  And support the broadcast that tell the truth.
[03:11:58.880 --> 03:12:02.120]  Support the broadcast and do it as an act of will against the enemy.
[03:12:02.120 --> 03:12:07.840]  If they can shut this broadcast down, they have victory over free speech in totality.
[03:12:07.840 --> 03:12:08.840]  And they know that.
[03:12:08.840 --> 03:12:13.480]  And that's why everything we do is symbiotic, and that's why it's exciting to see people
[03:12:13.480 --> 03:12:19.280]  excited about the new products we have and things like Ultra 12 that's double the amount
[03:12:19.280 --> 03:12:23.600]  of methylcobalamin, the highest quality B12 available.
[03:12:23.600 --> 03:12:30.240]  For 50% off, you cannot beat this, nothing like it, $24.95 for the best vitamin B12 out
[03:12:30.240 --> 03:12:31.240]  there.
[03:12:31.240 --> 03:12:36.120]  Now twice as strong, I signed a multi-year contract to be able to get you this price,
[03:12:36.120 --> 03:12:37.120]  and now it's half off.
[03:12:37.120 --> 03:12:38.360]  That's what you see how great it is.
[03:12:38.360 --> 03:12:44.200]  Again, no reviews yet because it's really secret 12 plus.
[03:12:44.200 --> 03:12:45.200]  Just came out.
[03:12:45.200 --> 03:12:49.360]  Go look at secret 12 and its reviews and get it.
[03:12:49.360 --> 03:12:51.200]  You need the products we have.
[03:12:51.200 --> 03:12:57.320]  You need the highest rated Alexa Pure Pro, Gravity-Fed stainless steel filter that they
[03:12:57.320 --> 03:12:58.640]  sold to us at their cost.
[03:12:58.640 --> 03:13:01.080]  We tagged 50 bucks on, so we can find ourselves.
[03:13:01.080 --> 03:13:03.040]  You need the heirloom seeds.
[03:13:03.040 --> 03:13:08.200]  Everything we do is like water filters, seeds, supplements, food.
[03:13:08.200 --> 03:13:10.620]  We're not selling you upside down crosses.
[03:13:10.620 --> 03:13:14.320]  We're not selling you little dead baby necklaces you wear around your neck as you celebrate
[03:13:14.320 --> 03:13:19.480]  the death of new humans and the innocent and show us how powerful you are.
[03:13:19.480 --> 03:13:21.520]  We are selling life.
[03:13:21.520 --> 03:13:26.160]  We are promoting symbiotic relationships, and am I in a rage against these people?
[03:13:26.160 --> 03:13:30.640]  You bet I am because they're so weak, and the fact that they're able to even get this
[03:13:30.640 --> 03:13:35.720]  toehold on us is pathetic right here in this republic.
[03:13:35.720 --> 03:13:38.180]  God gave us free will to choose good and evil.
[03:13:38.180 --> 03:13:43.600]  That's why our republic was the first country to say we don't have a state run religion,
[03:13:43.600 --> 03:13:48.400]  not because we weren't founded by Christians, but because real Christians said you have
[03:13:48.400 --> 03:13:50.520]  free will.
[03:13:50.520 --> 03:13:56.000]  And this country was founded by Puritans who didn't want to be under the Church of England,
[03:13:56.000 --> 03:13:58.080]  and didn't want to be under the Catholic Church.
[03:13:58.080 --> 03:13:59.960]  That's why we have separation of church and state.
[03:13:59.960 --> 03:14:01.760]  It doesn't mean you can't preach the Bible.
[03:14:01.760 --> 03:14:03.640]  It doesn't mean you can't hand out Christmas cards.
[03:14:03.640 --> 03:14:08.160]  It doesn't mean you can't say I'm a valovictorian, and thanks to Jesus, you have your speech.
[03:14:08.160 --> 03:14:15.040]  It means there can't be a state run religion of a state or a city or a county or a nation.
[03:14:15.040 --> 03:14:18.000]  Do you understand that?
[03:14:18.000 --> 03:14:19.000]  It's right there.
[03:14:19.000 --> 03:14:22.240]  Congress will make no law respecting and establishing religion, or prohibiting free exercise thereof,
[03:14:22.240 --> 03:14:26.160]  and the deals of the freedom of the press, the right to a civil, positionary disagreements.
[03:14:26.160 --> 03:14:27.540]  That's the first amendment.
[03:14:27.540 --> 03:14:32.560]  But now in movies, the shapeness of the champions of free speech, when they're the champions
[03:14:32.560 --> 03:14:40.680]  of cults and bondage and pain and lies and fraud and weakness and death, God is the God
[03:14:40.680 --> 03:14:47.800]  of life and success and real power, and the enemy knows that, and they can't stand it.
[03:14:47.800 --> 03:14:54.800]  So again, separation of church and state is we don't have a state run one religion.
[03:14:54.800 --> 03:14:56.640]  That would be a cult.
[03:14:56.640 --> 03:15:03.200]  We have religion protected in this country, and we were founded by Christians.
[03:15:03.200 --> 03:15:05.000]  Was there a handful of theists in there?
[03:15:05.000 --> 03:15:06.000]  Yes.
[03:15:06.000 --> 03:15:09.520]  The point is, Christians believe in freedom.
[03:15:09.520 --> 03:15:11.320]  Christians believe in free will.
[03:15:11.320 --> 03:15:14.800]  Christians don't threaten to kill you if you follow the Bible, the New Testament, if you
[03:15:14.800 --> 03:15:17.800]  don't convert.
[03:15:17.800 --> 03:15:23.240]  That's what we're talking about, and this isn't at the final equation even about that.
[03:15:23.240 --> 03:15:30.200]  It's about the operating system of world government that's anti-human, anti-God, anti-progress,
[03:15:30.200 --> 03:15:35.000]  anti-child, a death cult of globalists who've been promised that they're going to have silicon
[03:15:35.000 --> 03:15:40.760]  power and be new creatures as long as they kill the scourge that is humans.
[03:15:40.760 --> 03:15:45.960]  That is the operating system of Silicon Valley, of Hollywood, of the Democratic Party, and
[03:15:45.960 --> 03:15:46.960]  that is the truth.
[03:15:46.960 --> 03:15:48.960]  Mike Adams takes over in minutes.
[03:15:48.960 --> 03:15:55.960]  Stay with us.
[03:16:19.440 --> 03:16:23.000]  That's DanPilla.com, DanPilla.com.
[03:16:23.000 --> 03:16:28.400]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[03:16:28.400 --> 03:16:29.400]  the world.
[03:16:29.400 --> 03:16:32.400]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[03:16:32.400 --> 03:16:38.360]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[03:16:38.360 --> 03:16:42.160]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[03:16:42.160 --> 03:16:43.160]  Was there ever a vote?
[03:16:43.160 --> 03:16:44.720]  Who do we fight for?
[03:16:44.720 --> 03:16:51.280]  The deep state began with World War I, the United States of Empire, by James Dunn, available
[03:16:51.280 --> 03:16:52.720]  at Amazon Books.
[03:16:52.720 --> 03:16:55.240]  Okay, so a watch is good and some jewelry.
[03:16:55.240 --> 03:16:56.240]  Better grab some flowers too.
[03:16:56.240 --> 03:16:57.240]  Hey, whatcha doing?
[03:16:57.240 --> 03:16:58.240]  Mother's Day, remember?
[03:16:58.240 --> 03:16:59.240]  Oh, yeah.
[03:16:59.240 --> 03:17:02.000]  So I'm making lists, gotta plan a trip to the store, then need to save all the receipts
[03:17:02.000 --> 03:17:03.000]  in case she wants to return.
[03:17:03.000 --> 03:17:04.840]  Uh, you know there's an easier way, right?
[03:17:04.840 --> 03:17:05.840]  I'm guessing you do?

[03:17:54.360 --> 03:17:59.600]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[03:17:59.600 --> 03:18:04.880]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[03:18:04.880 --> 03:18:11.640]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[03:18:11.640 --> 03:18:17.520]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[03:18:17.520 --> 03:18:20.840]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[03:18:20.840 --> 03:18:25.520]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the
[03:18:25.520 --> 03:18:30.800]  fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[03:18:30.800 --> 03:18:32.320]  symptoms.
[03:18:32.320 --> 03:18:34.480]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[03:18:34.480 --> 03:18:35.720]  It is not an antihistamine.
[03:18:35.720 --> 03:18:40.400]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[03:18:40.400 --> 03:18:46.200]  triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[03:18:46.200 --> 03:18:48.880]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[03:18:48.880 --> 03:19:18.680]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block-chewable tablets.

[03:20:17.280 --> 03:20:19.600]  It's Mike Adams.
[03:20:19.600 --> 03:20:22.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.

[03:20:30.680 --> 03:20:32.080]  I need to apologize up front.
[03:20:32.080 --> 03:20:38.280]  We've got these massive storms swinging through here, Central Texas, and there might be glitches
[03:20:38.280 --> 03:20:39.280]  in the bandwidth.
[03:20:39.280 --> 03:20:40.280]  That's all I'm saying.
[03:20:40.280 --> 03:20:41.280]  It's not infowar servers.
[03:20:41.280 --> 03:20:42.280]  It's my fault.
[03:20:42.280 --> 03:20:46.200]  My studio's bandwidth is weather-impacted sometimes.
[03:20:46.200 --> 03:20:49.640]  So if I get disconnected or glitchy, just ask for your patience.
[03:20:49.640 --> 03:20:51.560]  And it actually is my fault.
[03:20:51.560 --> 03:20:57.480]  I have an old John Deere tractor built in the 1970s, and it has no emissions controls.
[03:20:57.480 --> 03:21:01.240]  And over the, I don't know, it was a few days ago, I let it idle for 20 minutes because
[03:21:01.240 --> 03:21:08.200]  I was trying to charge the battery and warm up the oil to gas off any moisture that might
[03:21:08.200 --> 03:21:10.920]  have condensed inside the engine because I hadn't run it for a while.
[03:21:10.920 --> 03:21:16.960]  And I'm told that my John Deere tractor emitted so many tons of carbon dioxide that it unleashed
[03:21:16.960 --> 03:21:20.240]  this entire storm system across four states.
[03:21:20.240 --> 03:21:22.440]  So it actually is my fault.
[03:21:22.440 --> 03:21:24.840]  And I apologize for all the storms.
[03:21:24.840 --> 03:21:28.720]  I'll try to idle the tractor a little bit less next time.
[03:21:28.720 --> 03:21:32.160]  Just a warning, if you have a diesel engine out there, just know if you idle that diesel
[03:21:32.160 --> 03:21:39.160]  engine, you might unleash a volcano or an earthquake or a hurricane or, I don't know, a meteor
[03:21:39.160 --> 03:21:40.160]  or something.
[03:21:40.160 --> 03:21:41.160]  Who knows?
[03:21:41.160 --> 03:21:44.120]  This is what we're being told by the eco-fascists.
[03:21:44.120 --> 03:21:50.000]  Also my day was very confusing because this morning I woke up and I found this little
[03:21:50.000 --> 03:21:54.880]  switch on the side of my kitchen sink and I flipped it on and the sink made this incredibly
[03:21:54.880 --> 03:21:58.040]  horrific, scary sound like the sink was screaming at me.
[03:21:58.040 --> 03:21:59.200]  I didn't know what was going on.
[03:21:59.200 --> 03:22:03.960]  So I called Ocasio-Cortez and I asked her, what is this thing?
[03:22:03.960 --> 03:22:05.360]  She said, I don't know.
[03:22:05.360 --> 03:22:08.760]  But everybody online is telling me that there's free food in there if you just reach in there
[03:22:08.760 --> 03:22:10.040]  and grab it.
[03:22:10.040 --> 03:22:16.200]  So I decided not to take that advice, which is why I've got all the fingers here.
[03:22:16.200 --> 03:22:18.720]  And we are ready to go.
[03:22:18.720 --> 03:22:19.720]  Thank goodness for that.
[03:22:19.720 --> 03:22:26.360]  Boy, I mean, who needs satire when these people mock themselves with everything they say,
[03:22:26.360 --> 03:22:29.680]  every time they open their mouths, they are mocking themselves.
[03:22:29.680 --> 03:22:31.480]  It's quite hilarious.
[03:22:31.480 --> 03:22:36.800]  It's like comedy hour in Washington, D.C. every time AOC opens her mouth.
[03:22:36.800 --> 03:22:38.200]  Now, onto serious subjects.
[03:22:38.200 --> 03:22:40.240]  This is not a joke broadcast.
[03:22:40.240 --> 03:22:43.680]  I've got many, many serious items to cover today.
[03:22:43.680 --> 03:22:51.080]  First of all, getting off of, or I'm sorry, following from what Alex Jones just said,
[03:22:51.080 --> 03:22:57.320]  he is absolutely right that there is a plan to coal about 90% of the human population.
[03:22:57.320 --> 03:23:03.320]  And he's also absolutely right that humanity has become incredibly weak after many, many
[03:23:03.320 --> 03:23:08.560]  generations of abundant food, easy economics, relatively easy money.
[03:23:08.560 --> 03:23:14.240]  There's so much weakness and really stupidity that's in the system now, that's in the population
[03:23:14.240 --> 03:23:15.240]  now.
[03:23:15.240 --> 03:23:22.520]  It continues to astonish me every single day, but it also reflects, it reflects what you've
[03:23:22.520 --> 03:23:26.760]  seen in laboratory experiments on animals as well as bacteria.
[03:23:26.760 --> 03:23:33.000]  And I'm not trying to compare humans to bacteria here, but it's an insightful study.
[03:23:33.000 --> 03:23:36.760]  I remember reading about a study where you just take a petri dish and you have bacteria
[03:23:36.760 --> 03:23:37.760]  there.
[03:23:37.760 --> 03:23:41.920]  As long as they have easy food, like auger mixes that are in there, as long as they have
[03:23:41.920 --> 03:23:48.800]  easy food, the bacteria multiply and breed and everything is great and the bacteria actually
[03:23:48.800 --> 03:23:54.440]  get weaker and weaker as long as everything is good because they don't have any challenges,
[03:23:54.440 --> 03:23:57.080]  they don't have to adapt, they don't have to survive.
[03:23:57.080 --> 03:24:01.600]  It's just endless replication and they're just spreading across the big petri dish.
[03:24:01.600 --> 03:24:07.200]  Well, once the food supply begins to run out, what happens to those bacteria?
[03:24:07.200 --> 03:24:13.320]  It turns out that they begin to fight with each other over shrinking resources.
[03:24:13.320 --> 03:24:18.640]  So the resources are diminishing, the bacteria start to actually produce chemical weapons
[03:24:18.640 --> 03:24:23.360]  that target other bacteria to try to kill them off so that they can survive.
[03:24:23.360 --> 03:24:28.320]  You start to see changes in aggressive behavior even in simple life forms.
[03:24:28.320 --> 03:24:30.880]  This has been observed in the lab over and over again.
[03:24:30.880 --> 03:24:32.480]  Same thing is true with animals.
[03:24:32.480 --> 03:24:37.880]  If you take a population of animals, I don't know, like coyotes or wolves or something,
[03:24:37.880 --> 03:24:42.680]  and you just let them breed into easy food, no problems, no challenges, they get lazier
[03:24:42.680 --> 03:24:46.840]  and more pathetic generation after generation and then at some point when the resources
[03:24:46.840 --> 03:24:52.360]  start to run out, they turn on each other and they start going to war with each other.
[03:24:52.360 --> 03:24:56.880]  You might say that this is some of what's happening in humanity right now except that
[03:24:56.880 --> 03:25:01.720]  it's the globalists that have declared war on humanity and have decided that they must
[03:25:01.720 --> 03:25:07.600]  destroy the planet, I'm sorry, well the human population on the planet in order to what
[03:25:07.600 --> 03:25:10.240]  they believe is saving the planet.
[03:25:10.240 --> 03:25:16.680]  So there is a massive plan to annihilate most of humanity.
[03:25:16.680 --> 03:25:18.920]  Now what does it have to do with you right now?
[03:25:18.920 --> 03:25:25.040]  Well, the censorship that we're seeing, this extreme censorship, is preparing the online
[03:25:25.040 --> 03:25:31.640]  landscape for the proper official narrative that will tell you what you are allowed to
[03:25:31.640 --> 03:25:36.360]  believe about this wipeout of humanity as it is taking place.
[03:25:36.360 --> 03:25:41.040]  Please understand, censorship is being done not for the sake of censorship.
[03:25:41.040 --> 03:25:47.640]  Censorship is being done for the reason to allow the narrative to be completely controlled
[03:25:47.640 --> 03:25:52.960]  by the globalists as they unleash whatever they are planning to unleash.
[03:25:52.960 --> 03:25:57.720]  One likely scenario is biological weapons, engineered bioweapons, released, the ones
[03:25:57.720 --> 03:26:02.000]  that they're testing in Africa all the time, unleashing them in North America and Europe
[03:26:02.000 --> 03:26:06.160]  and Asia and India and so on.
[03:26:06.160 --> 03:26:07.160]  That's one scenario.
[03:26:07.160 --> 03:26:13.000]  Another scenario is a grid down like a simulated solar flare attack that they could actually
[03:26:13.000 --> 03:26:17.040]  achieve through malicious cyberware or they could achieve through by launching nuclear
[03:26:17.040 --> 03:26:23.160]  weapons on themselves and detonating nuclear weapons for an EMP effect at high altitude
[03:26:23.160 --> 03:26:24.760]  on themselves.
[03:26:24.760 --> 03:26:29.960]  So the globalist countries in Europe and deep state elements within the United States and
[03:26:29.960 --> 03:26:35.920]  perhaps those in India and China, there might be a globalist coordinated effort to try to
[03:26:35.920 --> 03:26:38.960]  depopulate the planet, but they can't ever take the blame for it.
[03:26:38.960 --> 03:26:45.160]  So they have to blame the sun, blame a solar flare, blame, I don't know, rocks from space,
[03:26:45.160 --> 03:26:47.680]  whatever they need to blame, meteors.
[03:26:47.680 --> 03:26:50.040]  Basically space weather is the official term for that.
[03:26:50.040 --> 03:26:52.400]  They have to have a narrative.
[03:26:52.400 --> 03:26:58.040]  And I remember there's a documentary by a UFologist, I think his name is Dr. Stephen
[03:26:58.040 --> 03:27:04.920]  Greer, who I had interviewed him once and he told me, this is his view, not my words,
[03:27:04.920 --> 03:27:10.440]  but his words, that he believed there was going to be what he called a cosmic false flag
[03:27:10.440 --> 03:27:16.220]  where he believes that the globalists were going to fake an alien invasion to try to
[03:27:16.220 --> 03:27:25.160]  enslave humankind, that they were going to fake, you know, spaceships or something, fake,
[03:27:25.160 --> 03:27:26.720]  I mean, look, they control the narrative.
[03:27:26.720 --> 03:27:30.440]  So I guess they can fake anything they want because we've almost everything that we've
[03:27:30.440 --> 03:27:35.920]  seen has been a big event in the last 20 years has had some element of fakery in it and they've
[03:27:35.920 --> 03:27:39.480]  gotten away with it, you know, so I guess they can fake anything.
[03:27:39.480 --> 03:27:41.520]  But anyway, that's Dr. Greer's theory.
[03:27:41.520 --> 03:27:46.240]  The point is that something very big is about to happen and that's why the censorship has
[03:27:46.240 --> 03:27:52.040]  moved into such a stage of desperation because they have to eliminate humanity, but they
[03:27:52.040 --> 03:27:56.080]  have to create a narrative and control the narrative before they unleash the things that
[03:27:56.080 --> 03:27:57.480]  are going to happen.
[03:27:57.480 --> 03:28:05.520]  I think they also are working very hard to try to get somebody to call for violence who's
[03:28:05.520 --> 03:28:06.800]  a conservative.
[03:28:06.800 --> 03:28:11.400]  They want to see conservatives calling for violence, you know, kind of snapping and calling
[03:28:11.400 --> 03:28:13.360]  for violence, which we never do.
[03:28:13.360 --> 03:28:14.880]  We always say no violence.
[03:28:14.880 --> 03:28:17.120]  We have to do this through a peaceful process.
[03:28:17.120 --> 03:28:20.080]  We have to support our president, our commander in chief.
[03:28:20.080 --> 03:28:27.480]  Now I've called for the president to arrest these tech giant CEOs of the tech giants,
[03:28:27.480 --> 03:28:30.280]  but we never call for individual vigilante violence.
[03:28:30.280 --> 03:28:34.680]  But that's what the leftists want to see, even though that's their plan to unleash that
[03:28:34.680 --> 03:28:35.680]  on us.
[03:28:35.680 --> 03:28:38.800]  Well, I'll have much more on that straight ahead when we return here on the Alex Jones
[03:28:38.800 --> 03:28:39.800]  show.
[03:28:39.800 --> 03:28:40.800]  Stay with us.
[03:28:40.800 --> 03:28:55.600]  Okay, so a watch is good and some jewelry.
[03:28:55.600 --> 03:28:56.600]  Better grab some flowers too.
[03:28:56.600 --> 03:28:57.600]  Hey, what you doing?
[03:28:57.600 --> 03:28:58.600]  Mother's Day, remember?
[03:28:58.600 --> 03:28:59.600]  Oh, yeah.
[03:28:59.600 --> 03:29:02.320]  So I'm making lists, got to plan a trip to the store, then need to save all the receipts

[03:29:54.520 --> 03:29:58.200]  Our grandparents, our great grandparents, knew that they canned food during the fall,
[03:29:58.200 --> 03:30:00.200]  so they'd have it during the winter.

[03:31:53.880 --> 03:31:57.960]  You know, the worst part about getting old, and I'm still strong at 45, is that I won't
[03:31:57.960 --> 03:31:59.160]  be there for my children someday.
[03:31:59.160 --> 03:32:01.080]  That's why I need to make them strong now.
[03:32:01.080 --> 03:32:02.840]  Now I can be there for my children.
[03:32:02.840 --> 03:32:04.680]  Now I can make them strong.
[03:32:04.680 --> 03:32:06.320]  Now I can instruct them.
[03:32:06.320 --> 03:32:08.240]  Now I can teach them what I've learned.
[03:32:08.240 --> 03:32:09.240]  Not once I'm gone.
[03:32:09.240 --> 03:32:12.080]  You think of this digital age, your word's gone forever, but now they're even better
[03:32:12.080 --> 03:32:14.280]  getting rid of what you said and they were before.
[03:32:14.280 --> 03:32:19.000]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book
[03:32:19.000 --> 03:32:20.000]  burning, isn't it?
[03:32:20.000 --> 03:32:23.360]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[03:32:23.360 --> 03:32:27.640]  I can't be destroyed now, as long as I realize I've done right, and as long as the people
[03:32:27.640 --> 03:32:32.440]  know the truth, and you can't be destroyed either, as long as you bind yourself to something
[03:32:32.440 --> 03:32:35.400]  and commit to it, and go through the fire for it.
[03:32:35.400 --> 03:32:39.160]  There is a magic that then takes place, that prance in space and time.
[03:32:39.160 --> 03:32:42.960]  When you commit, be a word of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread our articles and
[03:32:42.960 --> 03:32:46.720]  videos, that overrides everything the enemy's doing.
[03:32:46.720 --> 03:32:51.320]  So please now, commit to support Infowars, however you can, and realize your provision
[03:32:51.320 --> 03:32:58.000]  to Infowars is your own provision.
[03:32:58.000 --> 03:33:13.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:13.520 --> 03:33:19.120]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:19.120 --> 03:33:22.680]  And now, your host, Mike Adams.
[03:33:22.680 --> 03:33:30.200]  If you listen to Infowars or watch Infowars every day, it's very easy to take this granted,
[03:33:30.200 --> 03:33:35.240]  and to take for granted, the fight that Alex Jones is in, and the fight that all of us
[03:33:35.240 --> 03:33:39.160]  are in, the fight of our lives, the fight for human freedom, for your right to speak,
[03:33:39.160 --> 03:33:41.520]  not just our own right to speak.
[03:33:41.520 --> 03:33:47.080]  I just want to say on the record, you know, we are blessed, humanity is blessed to have
[03:33:47.080 --> 03:33:52.920]  a fighter like Alex Jones, who is willing to stand up against all these vicious attacks.
[03:33:52.920 --> 03:33:56.240]  And believe me, he hasn't even told you the half of it.
[03:33:56.240 --> 03:34:00.000]  He hasn't even told me the half of it, and he's probably told me maybe more than he's
[03:34:00.000 --> 03:34:01.500]  mentioned publicly.
[03:34:01.500 --> 03:34:05.360]  And of course, I have attacks on me as well, but I'll just tell you the things we know
[03:34:05.360 --> 03:34:10.200]  that behind the scenes are so outrageous, you would not even believe them.
[03:34:10.200 --> 03:34:16.600]  And maybe someday it'll all come out if Alex chooses to share more, but that'll only happen
[03:34:16.600 --> 03:34:19.240]  probably after we defeat the globalists.
[03:34:19.240 --> 03:34:24.800]  And then I think Alex Jones will go down in history as a champion of human freedom.
[03:34:24.800 --> 03:34:28.360]  Don't take this for granted, the fact that Infowars is here.
[03:34:28.360 --> 03:34:32.800]  If Alex were any less of a fighter, if he were a weak person, Infowars would have been
[03:34:32.800 --> 03:34:34.320]  defeated long ago.
[03:34:34.320 --> 03:34:35.320]  No question about it.
[03:34:35.320 --> 03:34:42.080]  And people like Paul Joseph Watson are really treasures for humanity, it's not an exaggeration.
[03:34:42.080 --> 03:34:46.400]  Paul Joseph Watson being willing to speak out and standing up against the censorship
[03:34:46.400 --> 03:34:52.020]  and the attacks and now being labeled essentially a dangerous international terrorist, if you
[03:34:52.020 --> 03:34:53.520]  can believe that.
[03:34:53.520 --> 03:34:59.440]  I mean, President Trump just gave the Medal of Freedom to a golfer.
[03:34:59.440 --> 03:35:03.880]  I hope that one day President Trump might consider giving the Medal of Freedom to some
[03:35:03.880 --> 03:35:09.840]  of these champions of independent media who have really stood up against tyranny.
[03:35:09.840 --> 03:35:11.960]  And your support is absolutely crucial.
[03:35:11.960 --> 03:35:14.080]  Do not take this platform for granted.
[03:35:14.080 --> 03:35:17.560]  It's your purchases that keep this place alive.
[03:35:17.560 --> 03:35:21.920]  And you know, I'm a food scientist, I'm a nutritional supplement scientist, I run a lab.
[03:35:21.920 --> 03:35:25.640]  I saw they have Infowars has a sale today on their B12 formula.
[03:35:25.640 --> 03:35:26.640]  It's a new formula.
[03:35:26.640 --> 03:35:32.920]  It's got double the B12, 5,000 micrograms of the methylcobalamin form of B12.
[03:35:32.920 --> 03:35:39.040]  And I just, I have to say as a, as a formulator and a scientist, you, you will absolutely
[03:35:39.040 --> 03:35:45.280]  not find a better deal on this form of B12 from anybody anywhere.
[03:35:45.280 --> 03:35:48.400]  In fact, we couldn't even, we couldn't sell it for this low.
[03:35:48.400 --> 03:35:50.600]  We'd probably lose money if we tried to sell it for this low.
[03:35:50.600 --> 03:35:52.440]  I don't know how he gets that good of a deal.
[03:35:52.440 --> 03:35:57.640]  Do you realize that that key ingredient, methylcobalamin, if I recall the raw material of that in
[03:35:57.640 --> 03:36:01.360]  powder form, I think it costs $12,000 a kilo.
[03:36:01.360 --> 03:36:08.240]  Yes, some of these raw materials are more expensive than, you know, the most insane
[03:36:08.240 --> 03:36:09.760]  substance that you can think of.
[03:36:09.760 --> 03:36:15.880]  I mean, the cost of this is incredible because it's, it's, it's the bioavailable form of
[03:36:15.880 --> 03:36:17.280]  B12.
[03:36:17.280 --> 03:36:20.540]  There's other supplements, cheaper supplements that say they have B12, but they use what's
[03:36:20.540 --> 03:36:25.640]  called cyanocobalamin, which is a cyanide molecule combined with, you know, the, the
[03:36:25.640 --> 03:36:27.880]  cobalamin portion of the molecule.
[03:36:27.880 --> 03:36:30.440]  And it's not nearly as effective.
[03:36:30.440 --> 03:36:31.440]  And it's dirt cheap.
[03:36:31.440 --> 03:36:35.540]  It's just a few hundred dollars a kilo versus, I think it's over $12,000 a kilo for the
[03:36:35.540 --> 03:36:36.540]  methylcobalamin.
[03:36:36.540 --> 03:36:44.360]  So you're getting like ultra premium ingredients in huge functional doses at crazy discounted
[03:36:44.360 --> 03:36:45.360]  prices.
[03:36:45.360 --> 03:36:51.600]  I, even I, as someone who runs an entire nutritional supplement organization, I'm just astonished
[03:36:51.600 --> 03:36:53.320]  at what Infowars is able to put together.
[03:36:53.320 --> 03:36:57.360]  They must have got the best deal ever, ever seen in the industry.
[03:36:57.360 --> 03:37:00.640]  And if you get the auto ship on that, it's another 10% off.
[03:37:00.640 --> 03:37:03.200]  I think it's like $22 and something for a bottle.
[03:37:03.200 --> 03:37:09.720]  So check it out at infowarsstore.com, support your health and support this organization.
[03:37:09.720 --> 03:37:15.240]  Without Alex Jones, you know, we don't have this platform to fight for human freedom.
[03:37:15.240 --> 03:37:16.240]  And I agree with Alex.
[03:37:16.240 --> 03:37:21.640]  I think we're going to win, but we're going to have to go through sheer hell, I think,
[03:37:21.640 --> 03:37:24.880]  to get there because the battle is on.
[03:37:24.880 --> 03:37:28.680]  Now we've been here before, the human race has been here before.
[03:37:28.680 --> 03:37:30.320]  We saw the rise of the third right.
[03:37:30.320 --> 03:37:33.680]  You know, we saw fascism take over.
[03:37:33.680 --> 03:37:37.320]  And what's interesting about what's happening in the left today, the leftists, the, the
[03:37:37.320 --> 03:37:43.280]  Antifa people, the left wing media, the journal terrorists, they are whipping up hatred in
[03:37:43.280 --> 03:37:49.320]  the same way that the third right whipped up hatred against the enemies of Adolf Hitler.
[03:37:49.320 --> 03:37:54.080]  You know, before they could carry out the Holocaust, they had to create and invoke all
[03:37:54.080 --> 03:37:58.480]  of this hatred of their political enemies, their targeted enemies.
[03:37:58.480 --> 03:38:01.800]  That's exactly what social media is doing today.
[03:38:01.800 --> 03:38:03.960]  It's exactly what CNN is doing today.
[03:38:03.960 --> 03:38:06.840]  CNN is a factory of hate.
[03:38:06.840 --> 03:38:11.280]  And of course, they label everything that they want to censor hate speech while they
[03:38:11.280 --> 03:38:13.600]  are pushing hatred every day.
[03:38:13.600 --> 03:38:14.720]  They are pushing bigotry.
[03:38:14.720 --> 03:38:15.840]  They are pushing intolerance.
[03:38:15.840 --> 03:38:19.640]  They are, in essence, advocating violence, even Facebook.
[03:38:19.640 --> 03:38:25.600]  You know, they'll ban Paul Joseph Watson, but do they ban channels that actually openly
[03:38:25.600 --> 03:38:28.880]  advocate, let's say, radical Islamic terrorism?
[03:38:28.880 --> 03:38:29.880]  No.
[03:38:29.880 --> 03:38:30.880]  Often they don't.
[03:38:30.880 --> 03:38:32.920]  Maybe in a few cases they have, but often they don't.
[03:38:32.920 --> 03:38:36.920]  Do they ban the channels that call for the murder and execution of President Trump?
[03:38:36.920 --> 03:38:37.920]  No.
[03:38:37.920 --> 03:38:42.080]  They don't ban those channels because that's the hatred that they want to spread.
[03:38:42.080 --> 03:38:43.440]  That's who they are.
[03:38:43.440 --> 03:38:48.360]  All of these tech, these big tech organizations, they are at war with humanity.
[03:38:48.360 --> 03:38:52.800]  Now, let me address something that I've been criticized on about this.
[03:38:52.800 --> 03:38:57.480]  I have said that President Trump needs to use the power of government to go to war with
[03:38:57.480 --> 03:39:01.960]  these tech companies who arrest their CEOs and shut them down.
[03:39:01.960 --> 03:39:02.960]  That's what I've said.
[03:39:02.960 --> 03:39:03.960]  That's my view.
[03:39:03.960 --> 03:39:05.720]  That's not the official InfoWars view.
[03:39:05.720 --> 03:39:06.840]  Alex hasn't said that.
[03:39:06.840 --> 03:39:08.240]  That's me saying that.
[03:39:08.240 --> 03:39:11.840]  Some people have said, well, why would you want government to decide which corporations
[03:39:11.840 --> 03:39:12.840]  are allowed to operate?
[03:39:12.840 --> 03:39:15.160]  No, you don't understand.
[03:39:15.160 --> 03:39:20.480]  Every institution in society is at war against humanity and human freedom, including the
[03:39:20.480 --> 03:39:25.360]  left-wing governments, the left-wing deep state, the bureaucracy, the corporations,
[03:39:25.360 --> 03:39:29.640]  the education institutions, the Hollywood media, everything.
[03:39:29.640 --> 03:39:31.920]  Everything is at war with humanity.
[03:39:31.920 --> 03:39:38.360]  For this very short period of time, this short window, we have elected President Trump.
[03:39:38.360 --> 03:39:43.040]  He's in control of some small portion of the federal government.
[03:39:43.040 --> 03:39:46.560]  He must use what we control now.
[03:39:46.560 --> 03:39:49.080]  He must weaponize.
[03:39:49.080 --> 03:39:50.320]  That's not the right word.
[03:39:50.320 --> 03:39:55.160]  He must stop the weaponization of social media against us by using the power of government
[03:39:55.160 --> 03:40:02.120]  to defend humanity against this weaponization of speech that has been carried out by the
[03:40:02.120 --> 03:40:03.960]  social media giants.
[03:40:03.960 --> 03:40:08.040]  So in other words, government uses coercion to stop people.
[03:40:08.040 --> 03:40:09.680]  Government uses coercion to stop criminals.
[03:40:09.680 --> 03:40:12.040]  Government uses coercion to stop corporations sometimes.
[03:40:12.040 --> 03:40:15.880]  It's time to use that power while we have it, because we're never going to have it again
[03:40:15.880 --> 03:40:20.240]  if we don't defeat these tyrants, these techno-fascists right now.
[03:40:20.240 --> 03:40:25.240]  It's like if you were fighting in World War II and you're trying to defeat Adolf Hitler
[03:40:25.240 --> 03:40:30.640]  and you have your American soldiers, you break through the Axis front lines and you go in
[03:40:30.640 --> 03:40:36.280]  and you seize the artillery of the German soldiers, maybe some of their 88 flak guns
[03:40:36.280 --> 03:40:40.520]  or something, you seize German artillery, are you going to sit there and tell me that
[03:40:40.520 --> 03:40:45.960]  you shouldn't use their artillery against them, that you shouldn't turn that artillery
[03:40:45.960 --> 03:40:50.080]  around and fire those artillery rounds at Adolf Hitler's bunker?
[03:40:50.080 --> 03:40:51.800]  Of course you should.
[03:40:51.800 --> 03:40:57.880]  Trump should seize the moment, he should take the power that he has, a very limited window,
[03:40:57.880 --> 03:41:04.480]  and he should metaphorically fire the artillery, again a metaphor, not an actual physical artillery
[03:41:04.480 --> 03:41:05.480]  at these tech giants.
[03:41:05.480 --> 03:41:09.880]  He should do it through regulatory control, he could do it through illegal action.
[03:41:09.880 --> 03:41:14.520]  These companies have engaged in clear violations of RICO Act racketeering.
[03:41:14.520 --> 03:41:18.720]  They have engaged in massive fraud, they have engaged in human rights violations.
[03:41:18.720 --> 03:41:23.520]  They are guilty on so many levels, they could easily be investigated, indicted, perhaps
[03:41:23.520 --> 03:41:29.680]  shut down, or perhaps forced to sign a consent decree that simply says they will no longer
[03:41:29.680 --> 03:41:35.480]  violate the rights of American citizens, the basic human dignity rights.
[03:41:35.480 --> 03:41:39.080]  And if you think that these companies have the right to do whatever they want, I'll ask
[03:41:39.080 --> 03:41:40.480]  you this.
[03:41:40.480 --> 03:41:44.920]  What if Mark Zuckerberg suddenly became a conservative overnight?
[03:41:44.920 --> 03:41:48.120]  No, what if he became a racist bigot?
[03:41:48.120 --> 03:41:53.920]  What if Mark Zuckerberg announced that just as a bizarre example that no black people
[03:41:53.920 --> 03:41:58.160]  were allowed to use Facebook, if he announced that, how insane would that be?
[03:41:58.160 --> 03:42:00.040]  How bigoted would that be?
[03:42:00.040 --> 03:42:03.480]  But according to so many people out there, oh, it's a private company, they can do whatever
[03:42:03.480 --> 03:42:04.480]  they want to do.
[03:42:04.480 --> 03:42:05.480]  Really?
[03:42:05.480 --> 03:42:07.880]  What if they announced that no gay people can post on Facebook?
[03:42:07.880 --> 03:42:11.800]  How big of an outcry would there be?
[03:42:11.800 --> 03:42:13.000]  Because that's wrong.
[03:42:13.000 --> 03:42:16.760]  Every human, no matter the color of your skin, no matter your sexual orientation, no matter
[03:42:16.760 --> 03:42:19.040]  your religion, every human has a right to speak.
[03:42:19.040 --> 03:42:22.480]  But Facebook is banning conservatives, and Facebook is banning Christians, and Facebook
[03:42:22.480 --> 03:42:26.920]  is banning Trump supporters, and gun owners, and people who believe in the Constitution
[03:42:26.920 --> 03:42:28.680]  defending our borders.
[03:42:28.680 --> 03:42:30.160]  Why is that okay?
[03:42:30.160 --> 03:42:31.160]  It's not okay.
[03:42:31.160 --> 03:42:37.200]  And it's time for Trump to unleash the full power of government that he currently controls
[03:42:37.200 --> 03:42:41.000]  to stop the censorship of humanity by evil techno-fascists.
[03:42:41.000 --> 03:42:44.200]  We'll be back with more after this break.
[03:42:44.200 --> 03:42:47.200]  Stay with us.
[03:42:47.200 --> 03:43:11.200]  We'll be back with more after this break.
[03:43:11.200 --> 03:43:37.200]  We'll be back with more after this break.
[03:43:37.200 --> 03:43:42.480]  In my home, you will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure
[03:43:42.480 --> 03:43:44.480]  Breeze in your house.
[03:43:44.480 --> 03:43:49.000]  Don't live in a polluted major city in your home.

[03:44:54.760 --> 03:45:01.000]  Stacy in the great state of Texas, in FEMA Region 6, you're on the air worldwide, Stacy.
[03:45:01.000 --> 03:45:02.560]  Good to talk to you.
[03:45:02.560 --> 03:45:05.800]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally
[03:45:05.800 --> 03:45:06.960]  take vitamins at all.
[03:45:06.960 --> 03:45:08.880]  I was turned on to the ultimate female force.
[03:45:08.880 --> 03:45:13.240]  I looked at all the ingredients and they're all organic, root, things like that that I
[03:45:13.240 --> 03:45:14.240]  trust.
[03:45:14.240 --> 03:45:17.120]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins, they don't have things that they
[03:45:17.120 --> 03:45:20.280]  say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural, so I appreciate
[03:45:20.280 --> 03:45:21.280]  that.
[03:45:21.280 --> 03:45:22.280]  Well, what happened with ultimate female force?
[03:45:22.280 --> 03:45:23.280]  Tell us about it.
[03:45:23.280 --> 03:45:24.280]  Well, it's really great.
[03:45:24.280 --> 03:45:25.280]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[03:45:25.280 --> 03:45:26.280]  I take it.
[03:45:26.280 --> 03:45:27.280]  It tastes good.
[03:45:27.280 --> 03:45:28.280]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[03:45:28.280 --> 03:45:29.280]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[03:45:29.280 --> 03:45:33.160]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day, so I really like
[03:45:33.160 --> 03:45:34.160]  it.
[03:45:34.160 --> 03:45:36.960]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are, they're known to turbo
[03:45:36.960 --> 03:45:40.280]  charge women, and then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[03:45:40.280 --> 03:45:46.320]  So, yeah, stamina, libido, energy, these are amazing things, an ultimate female force.
[03:45:46.320 --> 03:46:03.400]  I'm glad you plugged it, infowarstore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[03:46:03.400 --> 03:46:09.800]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best selling supplement family in the world is
[03:46:09.800 --> 03:46:15.560]  energy drinks and energy supplements, but they are riddled with dyes and toxins and
[03:46:15.560 --> 03:46:20.000]  synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in
[03:46:20.000 --> 03:46:22.440]  just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[03:46:22.440 --> 03:46:29.000]  We have developed, hands down, from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout
[03:46:29.000 --> 03:46:31.280]  and beyond system in the world.
[03:46:31.280 --> 03:46:34.280]  If there's nothing else like it, you must experience it.
[03:46:34.280 --> 03:46:39.320]  It is a total game changer, and it comes in easy to use, packaged, mixed in with fruges
[03:46:39.320 --> 03:46:41.000]  or water, whatever you'd like.
[03:46:41.000 --> 03:46:42.800]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[03:46:42.800 --> 03:46:43.800]  It lasts up to 10 hours.
[03:46:43.800 --> 03:46:48.480]  So take a half pack at the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce
[03:46:48.480 --> 03:46:57.480]  because it will take you into overdrive, TurboForce, and infowarstore.com.
[03:46:57.480 --> 03:47:13.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:13.400 --> 03:47:16.600]  You've found it, the tip of the spear.
[03:47:16.600 --> 03:47:21.320]  It is the Alex Jones show with Mike Adams.
[03:47:21.320 --> 03:47:26.520]  You know, if you think about it, censorship that we're seeing now is really thought bubble
[03:47:26.520 --> 03:47:30.800]  reinforcement by the deranged lunatic left.
[03:47:30.800 --> 03:47:36.200]  They're living in an imaginary world, but because that imaginary world that's based
[03:47:36.200 --> 03:47:41.640]  on pure fiction and not facts, because it's reinforced so frequently through their own
[03:47:41.640 --> 03:47:47.440]  sources and through the censorship of any competing facts, well, they can continue to live in
[03:47:47.440 --> 03:47:49.360]  that delusional thought bubble.
[03:47:49.360 --> 03:47:52.640]  They get away with it, and their friends will reinforce their delusions.
[03:47:52.640 --> 03:47:58.600]  There are still people, a big number of people in America who think that Putin put Trump
[03:47:58.600 --> 03:47:59.800]  somehow into the White House.
[03:47:59.800 --> 03:48:01.560]  They think that Trump committed treason.
[03:48:01.560 --> 03:48:06.920]  They think the Mueller report somehow names Trump as carrying out treason.
[03:48:06.920 --> 03:48:10.000]  They believe this because this is what they've been told and what's been reported in the
[03:48:10.000 --> 03:48:11.520]  fake news media.
[03:48:11.520 --> 03:48:16.760]  And then you have Wikipedia that comes along and then reinforces all the false quote facts
[03:48:16.760 --> 03:48:19.520]  and bans any independent media sources.
[03:48:19.520 --> 03:48:22.240]  Even Breitbart is banned from Wikipedia.
[03:48:22.240 --> 03:48:24.280]  You can't cite Breitbart as a source.
[03:48:24.280 --> 03:48:26.840]  And now Facebook is going to start suppressing websites.
[03:48:26.840 --> 03:48:30.360]  This is the click gap, a new tool that they're going to use.
[03:48:30.360 --> 03:48:31.360]  It's a scheme.
[03:48:31.360 --> 03:48:37.040]  They're going to start suppressing websites that don't get cited by Wikipedia.
[03:48:37.040 --> 03:48:42.080]  But Wikipedia's rules don't allow anybody to cite a source that's the independent media.
[03:48:42.080 --> 03:48:45.840]  So it's just a circular logic, and it's all this delusional thought bubble.
[03:48:45.840 --> 03:48:50.280]  And this is what they're trying to do to keep everybody trapped in that.
[03:48:50.280 --> 03:48:56.400]  What they can't allow humanity to do is escape the mental prison, escape the mental prison
[03:48:56.400 --> 03:49:02.720]  and see a different source, see a different view, have actual facts that challenge the
[03:49:02.720 --> 03:49:04.360]  establishment.
[03:49:04.360 --> 03:49:05.360]  And it's on every issue.
[03:49:05.360 --> 03:49:07.800]  It's not just politics, it's about finance.
[03:49:07.800 --> 03:49:12.320]  It's about science and medicine, vaccines, GMOs, pesticides.
[03:49:12.320 --> 03:49:18.040]  If you have a competing view that contradicts or challenges the establishment, then you
[03:49:18.040 --> 03:49:19.200]  have to be suppressed.
[03:49:19.200 --> 03:49:23.920]  And not only will you be suppressed, you will be, of course, vilified, defamed, lied
[03:49:23.920 --> 03:49:28.520]  about, probably criminalized, labeled a terrorist, which seems to be what's happened to Paul
[03:49:28.520 --> 03:49:30.480]  Joseph Watson.
[03:49:30.480 --> 03:49:35.800]  And this is why it's so crucial to look at the alternative media sources that are out
[03:49:35.800 --> 03:49:42.680]  there, not only as infowars.com, one of the top media sources, and my sites, Natural
[03:49:42.680 --> 03:49:43.680]  News and others.
[03:49:43.680 --> 03:49:46.000]  You've also got news wars out there.
[03:49:46.000 --> 03:49:49.000]  We've got different news aggregation websites that are cropping up right now.
[03:49:49.000 --> 03:49:52.240]  I've been running censored.news for quite some time.
[03:49:52.240 --> 03:49:53.840]  Which is an excellent site.
[03:49:53.840 --> 03:49:58.360]  Mike Adams of naturalnews.com, I'm breaking in with huge news.
[03:49:58.360 --> 03:50:04.120]  I was in the kitchen, eating lunch, watching you and actually taking notes and going over
[03:50:04.120 --> 03:50:05.320]  some things.
[03:50:05.320 --> 03:50:09.240]  And then Kellen McBrain walked in and he said, here's the article you asked for two days
[03:50:09.240 --> 03:50:10.240]  ago.
[03:50:10.240 --> 03:50:11.240]  It took me two days.
[03:50:11.240 --> 03:50:15.320]  He goes, here's examples of every Democrat candidate for president saying we'll confiscate
[03:50:15.320 --> 03:50:18.800]  all semi-autos and swat team their homes if they don't.
[03:50:18.800 --> 03:50:20.600]  So that article is on infowars.com.
[03:50:20.600 --> 03:50:24.560]  I'll cover that obviously tomorrow and come up the war room, but here's the even bigger
[03:50:24.560 --> 03:50:25.560]  news.
[03:50:25.560 --> 03:50:30.280]  Again, there's the article proof every single dim candidate is a danger of the second amendment
[03:50:30.280 --> 03:50:34.760]  close from each individual show their hatred of the Constitution and American rights and
[03:50:34.760 --> 03:50:35.760]  their admission.
[03:50:35.760 --> 03:50:36.760]  They want to confiscate the guns.
[03:50:36.760 --> 03:50:37.760]  They want a civil war.
[03:50:37.760 --> 03:50:39.000]  But here's the big news.
[03:50:39.000 --> 03:50:43.640]  Katelyn Bennett with her out of the park videos that have been so incredible.
[03:50:43.640 --> 03:50:46.120]  She's done it beyond anything anyone's seen.
[03:50:46.120 --> 03:50:49.880]  This is coming up on the war room in 10 minutes with Owen Stroyer.
[03:50:49.880 --> 03:50:50.880]  He'll air the whole thing.
[03:50:50.880 --> 03:50:52.400]  She'll be on you name it.
[03:50:52.400 --> 03:50:56.600]  Most guilty white college students pay reparations to black man.
[03:50:56.600 --> 03:51:02.440]  And again, this shows the mind control that people are under at universities, even when
[03:51:02.440 --> 03:51:03.920]  he's wearing a mega hat.
[03:51:03.920 --> 03:51:06.320]  Here's just a few seconds of it and back to Mike Adams.
[03:51:06.320 --> 03:51:12.160]  We're here at Youngstown State University today with Joel Patrick.
[03:51:12.160 --> 03:51:25.280]  I'm here asking people if they will pay me some reparations reparations do you support
[03:51:25.280 --> 03:51:32.160]  reparations for black people because of slavery to some extent, yes.
[03:51:32.160 --> 03:51:33.160]  What about you?
[03:51:33.160 --> 03:51:34.160]  Do you support?
[03:51:34.160 --> 03:51:35.160]  Definitely.
[03:51:35.160 --> 03:51:36.160]  Perfect.
[03:51:36.160 --> 03:51:37.160]  So we have Joel over here.
[03:51:37.160 --> 03:51:38.160]  Joel Patrick.
[03:51:38.160 --> 03:51:39.160]  He has a reparation jar.
[03:51:39.160 --> 03:51:41.160]  You guys have the chance to pay him for your crimes.
[03:51:41.160 --> 03:51:44.160]  I just gave him 10 bucks and took him by his hands.
[03:51:44.160 --> 03:51:45.160]  He did?
[03:51:45.160 --> 03:51:46.160]  $10?
[03:51:46.160 --> 03:51:47.160]  All right, here we go.
[03:51:47.160 --> 03:51:49.160]  Grown men are going to get out their wallets to pay for slavery.
[03:51:49.160 --> 03:51:57.840]  All right, so this is the mind control.
[03:51:57.840 --> 03:51:59.360]  Mike Adams, I'm going to turn this over to you.
[03:51:59.360 --> 03:52:03.640]  This video just went live on inforwars.com and newswars.com.
[03:52:03.640 --> 03:52:04.640]  We're going to duplicate this at UT.
[03:52:04.640 --> 03:52:07.880]  I think the same thing will happen, but Caitlin Bennett and Millie Weaver and our crew is on
[03:52:07.880 --> 03:52:08.880]  Fuego.
[03:52:08.880 --> 03:52:11.360]  We're hosting today and thanks for letting me pop in, Mike.
[03:52:11.360 --> 03:52:12.840]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:52:12.840 --> 03:52:17.200]  This is fascinating because it shows the actual programming, the mind control.
[03:52:17.200 --> 03:52:21.960]  White people have been indoctrinated with a sense of white guilt to such an extent that
[03:52:21.960 --> 03:52:24.960]  they don't even believe that they themselves qualify as people anymore.
[03:52:24.960 --> 03:52:31.640]  I mean, this comes back to that Supreme Court decision that at one time decided that what
[03:52:31.640 --> 03:52:34.840]  black people, they said were only five eighths of a human.
[03:52:34.840 --> 03:52:39.680]  I wonder if white people today think they're only three eighths of a human because this
[03:52:39.680 --> 03:52:42.680]  is the level of brainwashing that it has come to.
[03:52:42.680 --> 03:52:43.840]  It's incredible.
[03:52:43.840 --> 03:52:48.920]  I think it's going to go so far where they could literally start telling young white
[03:52:48.920 --> 03:52:55.520]  millennials to line up like in that Star Trek episode, line up to be killed in the death
[03:52:55.520 --> 03:53:00.280]  chamber so that they can run their simulated AI war scenario.
[03:53:00.280 --> 03:53:01.780]  Remember that original Star Trek episode?
[03:53:01.780 --> 03:53:05.840]  That was great when the AI said we used to have wars before, but now we have simulations
[03:53:05.840 --> 03:53:08.160]  that you have to get in the chambers and die.
[03:53:08.160 --> 03:53:09.160]  That's right.
[03:53:09.160 --> 03:53:10.160]  Right.
[03:53:10.160 --> 03:53:12.800]  So the deaths are real, but the war is a simulation, but people have to die.
[03:53:12.800 --> 03:53:14.040]  I mean, wow.
[03:53:14.040 --> 03:53:17.760]  And that was decades ago that that was written by Roddenberry, I believe.
[03:53:17.760 --> 03:53:21.960]  And now you're actually seeing that kind of white guilt come to play.
[03:53:21.960 --> 03:53:25.560]  Makes you wonder, you mentioned this, Alex, before.
[03:53:25.560 --> 03:53:29.200]  I hope you can still hang with me for four minutes here.
[03:53:29.200 --> 03:53:35.360]  Well, does humanity have the will to survive anymore, or has it become so weak and so pathetic
[03:53:35.360 --> 03:53:36.800]  that it's just a suicide cult?
[03:53:36.800 --> 03:53:41.400]  Oh, I mean, I wouldn't saw this devil worship movie last night, Hell Satan.
[03:53:41.400 --> 03:53:44.760]  And they wrote PM like they're atheists, but then they really are devil worshipers.
[03:53:44.760 --> 03:53:46.640]  And they're just so weak and pathetic.
[03:53:46.640 --> 03:53:47.720]  And you and I would watch that.
[03:53:47.720 --> 03:53:48.720]  You're a hardworking guy.
[03:53:48.720 --> 03:53:49.720]  I'm a hardworking guy.
[03:53:49.720 --> 03:53:51.960]  I don't understand Mr. Manley, but up compared to them, we think that's pathetic.
[03:53:51.960 --> 03:53:55.040]  No, the left sees that it sees it being glorified.
[03:53:55.040 --> 03:53:56.040]  And it's all over the news.
[03:53:56.040 --> 03:54:00.000]  The Democratic Party says our new operating system will be Satanism.
[03:54:00.000 --> 03:54:01.520]  So it's now official.
[03:54:01.520 --> 03:54:03.600]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[03:54:03.600 --> 03:54:10.120]  And you're seeing people programmed to love the murder of babies born alive in fantasies
[03:54:10.120 --> 03:54:12.080]  is being embraced by the left.
[03:54:12.080 --> 03:54:18.080]  It's not just de-platforming people and de-personing human beings, but it's literally ripping their
[03:54:18.080 --> 03:54:20.840]  limbs apart in the womb.
[03:54:20.840 --> 03:54:24.440]  And CNN, a CNN guest, I think, declaring that an unborn baby.
[03:54:24.440 --> 03:54:25.440]  Oh, yeah, we have that clip.
[03:54:25.440 --> 03:54:26.440]  So we cue them.
[03:54:26.440 --> 03:54:27.440]  Can we cue that up?
[03:54:27.440 --> 03:54:31.480]  And by the way, in the film, the whole club kid thing is, before they get pedophilia going
[03:54:31.480 --> 03:54:35.040]  mainline, they would have men dressed up like babies and diapers and stuff, and then men
[03:54:35.040 --> 03:54:36.040]  would have sex with them.
[03:54:36.040 --> 03:54:40.360]  And they do that actually in satanic rituals, as they can't get real kids.
[03:54:40.360 --> 03:54:41.360]  That's done in this movie.
[03:54:41.360 --> 03:54:43.440]  And then they go, we're sick of babies.
[03:54:43.440 --> 03:54:44.440]  We don't like them.
[03:54:44.440 --> 03:54:45.440]  We're sick of unborn.
[03:54:45.440 --> 03:54:47.040]  We're sick of holding them on a pedestal.
[03:54:47.040 --> 03:54:48.680]  Piss on those babies.
[03:54:48.680 --> 03:54:53.360]  And I can't say all the rest of stuff.
[03:54:53.360 --> 03:54:56.200]  But the point is, is that it's truly pathetic.
[03:54:56.200 --> 03:55:00.840]  Here's that clip with them on CNN, and here's the representative down in Alabama or wherever.
[03:55:00.840 --> 03:55:01.840]  Here it is.
[03:55:01.840 --> 03:55:06.840]  All I'm saying to you, it ought to be a warmest choice.
[03:55:06.840 --> 03:55:14.200]  I'm not about to be as a male tell a woman what to do with her body.
[03:55:14.200 --> 03:55:21.360]  She has the right to make that decision herself, directly, you said.
[03:55:21.360 --> 03:55:26.800]  Some kids are not wanted, so you kill them now, I'll kill them later.
[03:55:26.800 --> 03:55:31.880]  You bring them into the world, I'm wanted, I'm loved, you sent them to the Nectar Shed.
[03:55:31.880 --> 03:55:35.600]  So you kill them now, I'll kill them later.
[03:55:35.600 --> 03:55:38.200]  But the bottom line, kill them now, I'll kill them later.
[03:55:38.200 --> 03:55:39.480]  We should be making this a sin.
[03:55:39.480 --> 03:55:40.800]  Now let's go to the next thing.
[03:55:40.800 --> 03:55:41.800]  Keep the baby comfortable.
[03:55:41.800 --> 03:55:43.120]  Now let's go to the next one.
[03:55:43.120 --> 03:55:44.120]  This is clip 12.
[03:55:44.120 --> 03:55:46.120]  Here I'm taking over.
[03:55:46.120 --> 03:55:48.120]  Mike invited the vampire in.
[03:55:48.120 --> 03:55:49.120]  Here I go.
[03:55:49.120 --> 03:55:51.000]  Vampire of time.
[03:55:51.000 --> 03:55:54.640]  One who is pregnant, that's not human being inside her.
[03:55:54.640 --> 03:55:59.000]  And now it's not a human being outside, so again, people think ganging up on an old person
[03:55:59.000 --> 03:56:03.200]  or an infirm person or a baby, you get power because I get your resources.
[03:56:03.200 --> 03:56:08.440]  No, human society builds a lattice of complex civilization that builds niches for everyone
[03:56:08.440 --> 03:56:11.080]  to operate in, not one crop economies.
[03:56:11.080 --> 03:56:14.680]  So they're teaching us to think that when someone fails to get ahead, that is not the
[03:56:14.680 --> 03:56:15.880]  true human system.
[03:56:15.880 --> 03:56:19.760]  We transcend the whole social Darwin system and build something more advanced.
[03:56:19.760 --> 03:56:23.720]  So the left removes actual competition to make us all strong.
[03:56:23.720 --> 03:56:27.160]  And then once they've removed all competition, then they feed on us one group after another.
[03:56:27.160 --> 03:56:28.160]  Here it is.
[03:56:28.160 --> 03:56:29.160]  That's the word to you.
[03:56:29.160 --> 03:56:30.160]  Yeah.
[03:56:30.160 --> 03:56:34.240]  Let's be clear here, Rick, with all of your distortions and horrible tales, I answered
[03:56:34.240 --> 03:56:41.040]  it numerous times when a woman gets pregnant, that is not a human being inside of her.
[03:56:41.040 --> 03:56:42.640]  It's part of her body.
[03:56:42.640 --> 03:56:49.560]  And this is about a whole agency and control of her body and making decisions about her
[03:56:49.560 --> 03:56:54.440]  body and part of her body with medical professionals.
[03:56:54.440 --> 03:56:55.440]  Those are the facts.
[03:56:55.440 --> 03:56:57.840]  And that is the law of medical professionals.
[03:56:57.840 --> 03:56:59.360]  They can do whatever they want to that.
[03:56:59.360 --> 03:57:00.560]  This is about a week.
[03:57:00.560 --> 03:57:01.560]  We keep them comfortable.
[03:57:01.560 --> 03:57:03.560]  Listen, you can do whatever they want.
[03:57:03.560 --> 03:57:04.560]  They torture the baby.
[03:57:04.560 --> 03:57:05.560]  You're spinning the baby.
[03:57:05.560 --> 03:57:06.560]  You're a little flesh ball.
[03:57:06.560 --> 03:57:07.560]  You're fine, guys.
[03:57:07.560 --> 03:57:08.560]  I gotta leave you here.
[03:57:08.560 --> 03:57:09.560]  You're so desperate here.
[03:57:09.560 --> 03:57:10.560]  No, no, no.
[03:57:10.560 --> 03:57:11.560]  We're bringing up fakes.
[03:57:11.560 --> 03:57:12.560]  I'm just asking you.
[03:57:12.560 --> 03:57:13.560]  All right.
[03:57:13.560 --> 03:57:14.560]  So some of my gathams.
[03:57:14.560 --> 03:57:15.560]  Now they're killing babies after they're born.
[03:57:15.560 --> 03:57:16.560]  All right.
[03:57:16.560 --> 03:57:17.560]  Close this out.
[03:57:17.560 --> 03:57:18.560]  naturalloose.com.
[03:57:18.560 --> 03:57:19.560]  Okay.
[03:57:19.560 --> 03:57:22.960]  Well, and, and look, this is going to escalate to the point where they are first criminalizing
[03:57:22.960 --> 03:57:27.560]  certifications and the vocalf mass.
[03:57:27.560 --> 03:57:31.160]  Oh, we got Skype going down there.
[03:57:31.160 --> 03:57:32.160]  Mike Adams.
[03:57:32.160 --> 03:57:33.160]  You're awesome.
[03:57:33.160 --> 03:57:34.160]  Join us again very, very soon.
[03:57:34.160 --> 03:57:37.560]  And I think what he's saying is they're going to criminalize saying the baby's alive,
[03:57:37.560 --> 03:57:39.360]  which they're already starting to say it's hate speech.
[03:57:39.360 --> 03:57:44.040]  That's all that the news to say a baby is a human.
