[00:00.000 --> 00:09.720]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:09.720 --> 00:10.720]  You want answers?
[00:10.720 --> 00:12.920]  Well, so does he.
[00:12.920 --> 00:17.080]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:17.080 --> 00:23.240]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:23.240 --> 00:33.160]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Monday, July 27th, 2015.
[00:33.160 --> 00:34.560]  I'm your host, David Knight.
[00:34.560 --> 00:37.560]  We're going to be joined later in the show by Alex Jones.
[00:37.560 --> 00:39.600]  He's doing investigative reporting in Europe.
[00:39.600 --> 00:44.360]  Of course, we all know what's happened with Greece, but there are other countries that
[00:44.360 --> 00:50.440]  are lined up along with this, Italy, Spain, Ireland, Portugal.
[00:50.440 --> 00:54.480]  All those countries are in for the same kind of treatment that we've seen in Greece.
[00:54.480 --> 00:56.760]  Are we going to learn anything from this?
[00:56.760 --> 01:02.880]  Is that a chance for us to stop the consolidation globally, or will it just be more corruption,
[01:02.880 --> 01:05.120]  more crony capitalism?
[01:05.120 --> 01:06.760]  Alex is in London today.
[01:06.760 --> 01:08.600]  He's going to be calling in and talking to us.
[01:08.600 --> 01:12.520]  We also have a special report from him that we're going to be playing later in the show.
[01:12.520 --> 01:16.360]  Today, we're going to look at some of the things that happened over the weekend.
[01:16.360 --> 01:22.800]  Of course, there was a special session yesterday where Rand Paul tried a gambit to get something
[01:22.800 --> 01:25.320]  done about Planned Parenthood.
[01:25.320 --> 01:28.560]  Ted Cruz is very upset about Mitch McConnell over the weekend.
[01:28.560 --> 01:36.720]  He just came out and flatly called him a liar, very plain spoken, very true, I believe.
[01:36.720 --> 01:41.360]  I don't agree with all the policies of Ted Cruz, but he's said and done some very good
[01:41.360 --> 01:42.360]  things.
[01:42.360 --> 01:45.520]  And I think one of the things that we need to do is we need to call out the leadership
[01:45.520 --> 01:51.400]  of the Republican Party when they get elected under false pretenses, when they lie to the
[01:51.400 --> 01:55.040]  American people, when they play games like they are with Obamacare.
[01:55.040 --> 02:02.480]  Again, this weekend, what they did was they brought up all of Obamacare as a massive bill,
[02:02.480 --> 02:05.840]  knowing that it would get a straight up or straight down vote from the Republicans and
[02:05.840 --> 02:08.920]  the Democrats along partisan lines.
[02:08.920 --> 02:13.280]  Areas where they could scale it back where they could start making some substantive changes
[02:13.280 --> 02:18.080]  with the levels of people that they have in the Senate right now with the current makeup
[02:18.080 --> 02:21.640]  of the Senate, those are ignored by the leadership.
[02:21.640 --> 02:26.520]  So they play these games where they say, well, we had the vote and see it lost again.
[02:26.520 --> 02:27.960]  And that's what they're upset about.
[02:27.960 --> 02:30.880]  And so we're going to play the clip.
[02:30.880 --> 02:37.320]  Actually, the Senate session today began with a reprimand from Orrin Hatch, part of the
[02:37.320 --> 02:41.880]  old guard, part of the corruption that is in Washington, part of the single party.
[02:41.880 --> 02:44.760]  And that's what Ted Cruz had rightfully pointed out.
[02:44.760 --> 02:49.560]  Look, this is why Donald Trump is soaring in the polls.
[02:49.560 --> 02:52.360]  People are sick and tired of the lies.
[02:52.360 --> 02:53.680]  We see through them.
[02:53.680 --> 02:55.040]  Everybody sees through the lies.
[02:55.040 --> 03:01.120]  Anybody that pays the slightest attention to the political process understands these
[03:01.120 --> 03:06.720]  transparent lies are being told to them by both leaders, the leaders of both parties.
[03:06.720 --> 03:12.000]  So Obama lying to his base, it's Nancy Pelosi lying to her base talking about how they're
[03:12.000 --> 03:16.280]  for civil liberties, for their transparency that they don't want to push war.
[03:16.280 --> 03:21.280]  It's about the Republicans lying to their base on economic issues that they feel are
[03:21.280 --> 03:22.280]  important.
[03:22.280 --> 03:23.440]  None of them do anything.
[03:23.440 --> 03:27.360]  And so when you have somebody that comes out like Donald Trump and calls them on their
[03:27.360 --> 03:33.320]  lies, addresses the problems that people see happening, the massive open borders, people
[03:33.320 --> 03:34.840]  coming in from all countries.
[03:34.840 --> 03:37.320]  This is not something about one particular country.
[03:37.320 --> 03:38.880]  It's not simply about Mexico.
[03:38.880 --> 03:43.880]  I think that's where Donald Trump has gone off the rails to make it about one group of
[03:43.880 --> 03:45.240]  people, about one country.
[03:45.240 --> 03:47.920]  As we're going to see, this is broad based.
[03:47.920 --> 03:50.240]  There is no limit to this.
[03:50.240 --> 03:54.320]  And there has to be a limit to the number of people that we can assimilate into the country
[03:54.320 --> 03:55.680]  at a given time.
[03:55.680 --> 03:59.360]  There also has to be a limit to what we do.
[03:59.360 --> 04:04.120]  We need to have equal treatment of Americans, at least treat us as well as the people who
[04:04.120 --> 04:06.560]  are coming here legally and illegally.
[04:06.560 --> 04:09.080]  And we need to do something about the war on drugs.
[04:09.080 --> 04:15.160]  Now, we've got to report, Sheriff Joe is telling Donald Trump, let's go to Mexico and let's
[04:15.160 --> 04:20.080]  talk to them about really getting serious about the war on drugs.
[04:20.080 --> 04:21.080]  Really?
[04:21.080 --> 04:27.840]  After 40 some odd years of a failed war on drugs, it just gets more and more violent
[04:27.840 --> 04:28.840]  and pervasive.
[04:28.840 --> 04:30.040]  Yeah, it's a big problem.
[04:30.040 --> 04:34.600]  That's one of the big problems with these open borders, with our policies, is that the
[04:34.600 --> 04:39.440]  violence that we've seen in Mexico with over 30,000 people, I don't know what the current
[04:39.440 --> 04:40.440]  number is.
[04:40.440 --> 04:42.440]  It's probably higher than that.
[04:42.440 --> 04:46.800]  But the incredible violence that we've seen there, this has been going on for nearly 50
[04:46.800 --> 04:47.800]  years.
[04:47.800 --> 04:49.280]  Our alcohol prohibition only went on for 13 years.
[04:49.280 --> 04:50.280]  So we're going to talk about that.
[04:50.280 --> 04:51.280]  Stay with us.
[04:51.280 --> 04:59.160]  We'll be right back.
[04:59.160 --> 05:03.520]  Next week, while on a campaign stop in Iowa, Donald Trump specifically mentioned the video
[05:03.520 --> 05:09.200]  Joe Biggs and Josh Owens shot showing illegal immigrants smuggling drugs into this country.
[05:09.200 --> 05:13.080]  And over the weekend, he retweeted a message from one of his campaign staffers with a direct
[05:13.080 --> 05:14.080]  link to the video.
[05:14.080 --> 05:19.040]  Actually, the camera crew or the reporters were petrified because they thought they were
[05:19.040 --> 05:22.000]  going to be killed because they're showing this on camera.
[05:22.000 --> 05:24.520]  The guys carrying bags of stuff, it was drugs.
[05:24.520 --> 05:28.440]  Both Trump and Bernie Sanders are rising in the polls as these two mavericks seem to be
[05:28.440 --> 05:29.920]  a threat to the establishment.
[05:29.920 --> 05:34.080]  But as Curt Nimmel writes, the puppet masters behind the political facade have absolutely
[05:34.080 --> 05:36.480]  no fear of Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders.
[05:36.480 --> 05:40.840]  Both are part of a traveling sideshow on the road to the primaries in the November 2016
[05:40.840 --> 05:41.840]  presidential election.
[05:41.840 --> 05:45.320]  Bush or Clinton will sit in the White House come January 2017.
[05:45.320 --> 05:49.360]  And everything between now and then is little more than pure political theater.
[05:49.360 --> 05:53.400]  You can read more in the article, forget Trump and Bernie, here's why Clinton or Bush will
[05:53.400 --> 05:56.080]  be the next president on Infowars.com.
[05:56.080 --> 05:58.640]  Rob Dew reporting.
[06:26.080 --> 06:32.160]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[06:32.160 --> 06:37.280]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors
[06:37.280 --> 06:40.560]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[06:40.560 --> 06:45.840]  Just one of the key compounds, BiopqQ is backed by major clinical studies.
[06:45.840 --> 06:48.360]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[06:48.360 --> 06:50.400]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[06:58.960 --> 07:03.200]  Another major health threat, this one in Toledo, Ohio where everybody in the entire city has
[07:03.200 --> 07:05.000]  been told not to drink the water.
[07:05.000 --> 07:07.680]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[07:07.680 --> 07:13.360]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every
[07:13.360 --> 07:14.680]  single day?
[07:14.680 --> 07:17.680]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[07:17.680 --> 07:20.680]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[07:20.680 --> 07:22.680]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[07:22.680 --> 07:25.600]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[07:25.600 --> 07:31.520]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[07:31.520 --> 07:34.880]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[07:34.880 --> 07:37.920]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[07:37.920 --> 07:43.920]  The ProPure Pro 1 G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have for every modern independently
[07:43.920 --> 07:45.680]  minded household.
[07:45.680 --> 07:48.440]  It's your family's safety during an emergency.

[07:54.760 --> 08:16.080]  or call 1-88-253-3139.
[08:16.080 --> 08:30.920]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Monday, July 27th, 2015.
[08:30.920 --> 08:33.600]  I'm David Knight, your host here in Austin.
[08:33.600 --> 08:38.840]  Alex Jones is in England investigating the globalist takeover of Europe.
[08:38.840 --> 08:44.120]  He's going to be traveling to other areas besides England as part of this investigative
[08:44.120 --> 08:45.120]  reporting.
[08:45.120 --> 08:47.480]  He's joining us later in the show with a live report.
[08:47.480 --> 08:51.080]  We're also going to have a special report from him at the bottom of this hour.
[08:51.080 --> 08:55.000]  Paul Joseph Watson will be joining us also in the show.
[08:55.000 --> 09:00.320]  Now as we look at Europe, of course, Greece still does not have their capital controls
[09:00.320 --> 09:01.320]  lifted.
[09:01.320 --> 09:02.560]  Isn't that amazing?
[09:02.560 --> 09:07.120]  These people have been suffering under this punitive measure.
[09:07.120 --> 09:11.800]  Even after they have agreed to release the funds to them, the banks still have not done
[09:11.800 --> 09:12.800]  that.
[09:12.800 --> 09:18.040]  They came up with the first offer, remember, and they said, no, we don't want to accept
[09:18.040 --> 09:19.040]  that offer.
[09:19.040 --> 09:20.040]  That's what the Greek people said.
[09:20.040 --> 09:26.320]  And then they got subverted by their socialist leader, Alexis Tsipras, in the same way that
[09:26.320 --> 09:34.760]  Hugo Chavez betrayed his people for the bankers, giving them a 700% return on their investment
[09:34.760 --> 09:40.120]  as Bloomberg's investment news bragged, been as well as a great place to invest.
[09:40.120 --> 09:45.640]  They get 700% investment, they understand that they need to take care of our debt before
[09:45.640 --> 09:47.040]  they do anything for the people.
[09:47.040 --> 09:51.480]  And so in that same article, they were talking about how they were suffering from food and
[09:51.480 --> 09:54.080]  water and medicine shortages in Venezuela.
[09:54.080 --> 09:57.960]  Now we see the same thing happening again with a socialist leader.
[09:57.960 --> 10:00.120]  The people think he's going to stand for the people.
[10:00.120 --> 10:04.320]  Instead, they use this facade, this veneer of standing for the people, even when they
[10:04.320 --> 10:09.080]  have a clear referendum that they don't want to go down this road.
[10:09.080 --> 10:10.080]  They do it anyway.
[10:10.080 --> 10:14.520]  The second deal was far worse than the first one.
[10:14.520 --> 10:20.480]  They wound up with $50 billion worth of hard assets, far more than the original loan was
[10:20.480 --> 10:25.920]  going to be in terms of just confiscating those assets and then piling new loans, extending
[10:25.920 --> 10:28.640]  and pretending this out into the future.
[10:28.640 --> 10:35.800]  So now what we see is a question, this is from Yahoo News, saying, how can Greece loosen
[10:35.800 --> 10:39.880]  the capital controls that are shielding its banks but strangling the rest of the economy
[10:39.880 --> 10:42.760]  because we don't really care about the rest of the economy.
[10:42.760 --> 10:44.800]  It's the banks that have to be shielded, right?
[10:44.800 --> 10:48.800]  They say for the past month, Greece has been financially cut off from the rest of the world.
[10:48.800 --> 10:53.440]  It's almost impossible for most Greeks to take money out of the country thanks to a raft
[10:53.440 --> 10:59.640]  of capital control measures that were put in place amid fears of catastrophic bank runs.
[10:59.640 --> 11:04.640]  And they point out that most large depositors have removed their money already.
[11:04.640 --> 11:09.840]  They say the remaining uninsured deposits, about 30% of the deposit base, are mainly
[11:09.840 --> 11:14.720]  the working capital of Greek businesses, small businesses.
[11:14.720 --> 11:20.240]  These are the people that they came to and said, we're going to confiscate the money
[11:20.240 --> 11:22.680]  that's being paid to you by tour operators even.
[11:22.680 --> 11:26.400]  You're not going to be able to get that, we're going to interpose ourself in here, we're
[11:26.400 --> 11:28.600]  going to confiscate that money.
[11:28.600 --> 11:32.000]  You provided the services, you provided the goods, but you're not going to get paid.
[11:32.000 --> 11:35.600]  The banks are going to take your money because they always come first because they write
[11:35.600 --> 11:36.720]  the rules.
[11:36.720 --> 11:41.680]  They say bailing in would be far more destructive for the Greek economy than the bail-in of
[11:41.680 --> 11:43.560]  large depositors was for Cyprus.
[11:43.560 --> 11:46.520]  See, they're still talking about the bail-in.
[11:46.520 --> 11:48.960]  Remember that was floated by a British paper.
[11:48.960 --> 11:54.400]  They were talking about bailing in deposits at 8,000 euros.
[11:54.400 --> 11:58.040]  Now understand that when they stole people's money out of the banks in Cyprus, they only
[11:58.040 --> 12:04.200]  did that for deposits that were over 100,000 euros because like in the United States, they
[12:04.200 --> 12:08.040]  have depositor insurance and that was the limit of depositor insurance.
[12:08.040 --> 12:13.440]  So as bad as it was, you could say, well okay, they had that insured up to 100,000 people
[12:13.440 --> 12:17.200]  understood that they didn't have insurance beyond that level.
[12:17.200 --> 12:22.040]  What they're saying here though is they floated the trial balloon more than once that they
[12:22.040 --> 12:26.760]  would go in down to the level of 8,000 euros even though they've told people that those
[12:26.760 --> 12:28.960]  deposits are insured.
[12:28.960 --> 12:32.240]  Banks words don't mean anything, right?
[12:32.240 --> 12:34.160]  That's what we're looking at here.
[12:34.160 --> 12:39.520]  So they're basically going to steal the working capital of the Greek people as they steal their
[12:39.520 --> 12:40.520]  infrastructure.
[12:40.520 --> 12:45.800]  And if you think it's not going to happen here, I mean, we are far more leveraged in
[12:45.800 --> 12:52.920]  terms of unfunded mandates and liabilities than the Greek people were.
[12:52.920 --> 12:58.960]  This is something that is absolutely possible and inevitable if we do not change the way
[12:58.960 --> 13:01.120]  we do business here.
[13:01.120 --> 13:06.320]  So Alex Jones is going to be investigating in Europe, following reports and as I said,
[13:06.320 --> 13:09.200]  he's going, we're going to have a special report from him at the bottom of the hour.
[13:09.200 --> 13:12.280]  And again, in the next hour, he's going to be joining us live.
[13:12.280 --> 13:18.440]  Now the US Senate today opened with an interesting reprimand from Oren Hatch and I want to play
[13:18.440 --> 13:24.360]  that reprimand for you and then tell you what this is about.
[13:24.360 --> 13:28.360]  Deliberation without decorum is not deliberation at all.
[13:28.360 --> 13:29.920]  It is bickering.
[13:29.920 --> 13:34.360]  And bickering, Mr. President, is beneath this body.
[13:34.360 --> 13:38.760]  Regrettably in recent times, the Senate floor has too often become a forum for partisan
[13:38.760 --> 13:44.800]  messaging and ideological grandstanding rather than a setting for serious debate.
[13:44.800 --> 13:51.720]  It has been misused as a tool to advance personal ambitions, a venue to promote political campaigns,
[13:51.720 --> 13:56.960]  and even a vehicle to enhance fundraising efforts, all at the expense of proper functioning
[13:56.960 --> 13:59.160]  of this body.
[13:59.160 --> 14:05.600]  Disagregiously, Mr. President, the Senate floor has even become a place where senators
[14:05.600 --> 14:11.280]  have singled out colleagues by name to attack them in personal terms and to impugn their
[14:11.280 --> 14:18.880]  character in blatant disregard of Senate rules, which plainly prohibits such conduct.
[14:18.880 --> 14:26.520]  Mr. President, I thank the senior senator from Utah for an excellent speech and I entirely
[14:26.520 --> 14:32.320]  agree with his call for civility and decorum in respect.
[14:32.320 --> 14:37.680]  No member of this body should engage in ad hominem attacks directed at any other member
[14:37.680 --> 14:43.480]  of this body, be they a Republican or be they a Democrat.
[14:43.480 --> 14:49.480]  At the same time, I would note that it is entirely consistent with decorum and with
[14:49.480 --> 14:56.160]  the nature of this body traditionally as the world's greatest deliberative body to speak
[14:56.160 --> 14:58.680]  the truth.
[14:58.680 --> 15:07.320]  Speaking the truth about actions is entirely consistent with civility, indeed in a quote
[15:07.320 --> 15:14.560]  often attributed falsely to George Orwell, the sentiment has been expressed thusly.
[15:14.560 --> 15:22.240]  In a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[15:22.240 --> 15:29.840]  There you go, so they were angry with Ted Cruz because he had called out Mitch McConnell
[15:29.840 --> 15:32.520]  and said he had lied.
[15:32.520 --> 15:36.080]  And that is the truth, that is a revolutionary act.
[15:36.080 --> 15:42.480]  That is why, as I said before in the previous segment, that's why Ted Cruz and Donald Trump
[15:42.480 --> 15:47.600]  are doing well in the polls because they call these people out as liars.
[15:47.600 --> 15:51.880]  Now, of course, what Orrin Hatch was talking about, he said the chair reminds all senators
[15:51.880 --> 15:55.560]  of the following paragraph in the rules that no senator in debate shall indirectly or indirectly
[15:55.560 --> 16:01.480]  of any form of words impute to another senator any conduct or motives unworthy or unbecoming
[16:01.480 --> 16:02.480]  etc.
[16:02.480 --> 16:08.400]  Look, as Ted Cruz pointed out, he didn't engage and add hominem attacks, he didn't attack
[16:08.400 --> 16:14.760]  Mitch McConnell's personal life, he didn't attack his appearance, he attacked the substance
[16:14.760 --> 16:16.840]  of what he does.
[16:16.840 --> 16:21.000]  And if we can't attack that substance that we have a real problem, and this is the problem
[16:21.000 --> 16:23.840]  that Ted Cruz, this is why he called him a liar.
[16:23.840 --> 16:31.400]  And they say this is a report from, let's see, this article is from, well, I don't have
[16:31.400 --> 16:36.480]  the source here, it's not printed on that thing here, but it's Washington Post.
[16:36.480 --> 16:40.720]  They say that Cruz was unbowed firing back soon after leaving the Senate floor.
[16:40.720 --> 16:45.720]  He accused leaders of marching in lockstep with Democrats on things like the Affordable
[16:45.720 --> 16:51.240]  Care Act, funding Planned Parenthood, and refusing to tie an Iran nuclear deal to Iran's recognition
[16:51.240 --> 16:53.200]  of Israel's right to exist.
[16:53.200 --> 16:57.680]  He said they operate as a team, they expand Washington, they undermine the liberty of
[16:57.680 --> 16:58.680]  the people.
[16:58.680 --> 17:01.200]  He said we've just seen something extraordinary on the Senate floor.
[17:01.200 --> 17:05.720]  The American people elected a Republican majority believing that the Republican majority would
[17:05.720 --> 17:10.120]  somehow be different from a Democrat majority in the U.S. Senate.
[17:10.120 --> 17:15.960]  But fortunately, the way the current Senate operates, there is a single party, the Washington
[17:15.960 --> 17:16.960]  Party.
[17:16.960 --> 17:19.560]  That's right, you don't have a left wing, you don't have a right wing, you've only
[17:19.560 --> 17:24.600]  got one wing, and we're not going anywhere because, except going down.
[17:24.600 --> 17:29.160]  And that's where we're descending into an authoritarian government with everything
[17:29.160 --> 17:30.640]  centered in Washington.
[17:30.640 --> 17:34.960]  And again, to give you an idea of the kind of games that they play with this, and this
[17:34.960 --> 17:38.480]  is one of the things that they're upset about, and people say, well, Mitch McConnell had
[17:38.480 --> 17:44.200]  a vote on Obamacare, but he rigged it so that it was simply a symbolic vote.
[17:44.200 --> 17:48.000]  And that's what Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, Rand Paul, others are so upset about.
[17:48.000 --> 17:53.600]  What he did was he had an up or down vote on the entire thing of Obamacare.
[17:53.600 --> 17:57.360]  He says we'll have a vote on repealing Obamacare, the Republicans will all vote yes, the Democrats
[17:57.360 --> 18:00.320]  will all vote no, it'll be a 60 vote threshold, and it will fail.
[18:00.320 --> 18:03.200]  Ted Cruz saw this coming up, he said that's exactly what you're going to have, he says
[18:03.200 --> 18:06.960]  it'll be an exercise in meaningless political theater.
[18:06.960 --> 18:12.200]  Other senators have said, obviously, a full repeal and replace is not going to go with
[18:12.200 --> 18:13.640]  the current makeup of the Senate.
[18:13.640 --> 18:14.960]  But what could they do?
[18:14.960 --> 18:20.680]  Well, Senator Shelley Moore, a capitol of West Virginia, said before the vote was scheduled,
[18:20.680 --> 18:26.400]  I would like to see us do things like move the work week back to 40 hours instead of
[18:26.400 --> 18:29.800]  defining a full-time employee as 30 hours.
[18:29.800 --> 18:33.280]  Some little things like that that could make a huge difference.
[18:33.280 --> 18:40.160]  Or you might even put some teeth in it and say, you know what, the IRS is imposing fines
[18:40.160 --> 18:45.960]  that are 12 times the amount that was put in the Affordable Care Act.
[18:45.960 --> 18:49.680]  They're imposing fines 12 times higher than the Obamacare law.
[18:49.680 --> 18:51.560]  Do you understand that?
[18:51.560 --> 18:58.120]  The IRS, which was given 17,000 new IRS agents to persecute people over Obamacare, is now
[18:58.120 --> 19:03.040]  just arbitrarily setting the fees to be 12 times higher than what's in the law.
[19:03.040 --> 19:07.640]  So maybe what you could do is put some teeth into the law.
[19:07.640 --> 19:13.240]  But no, you just have business as usual with Mitch McConnell, with Orrin Hatch, with the
[19:13.240 --> 19:17.200]  leadership of John Boehner, and the rest of the Republicans there.
[19:17.200 --> 19:20.200]  Now, Hillary Clinton has made news over the weekend.
[19:20.200 --> 19:21.200]  She's confident.
[19:21.200 --> 19:25.280]  She says she never sent or received any information that was classified at the time that it was
[19:25.280 --> 19:26.920]  sent and received.
[19:26.920 --> 19:29.800]  She had no textual relations.
[19:29.800 --> 19:34.640]  It's the same kind of denials that we saw coming out of Bill Clinton.
[19:34.640 --> 19:39.320]  The Inspector General has looked at these emails, four out of the 40 that he's looked
[19:39.320 --> 19:42.440]  at had classified material in them.
[19:42.440 --> 19:44.160]  That's 10% of what he's looked at so far.
[19:44.160 --> 19:45.520]  And of course, there's a lot to look at.
[19:45.520 --> 19:49.760]  There's 55,000 pages worth of emails.
[19:49.760 --> 19:50.760]  Stay with us when we come back.
[19:50.760 --> 19:54.680]  We're going to talk about where her money is coming from.
[19:54.680 --> 19:55.680]  You won't believe this one.
[19:55.680 --> 19:59.200]  We'll be right back.
[19:59.200 --> 20:28.320]  We'll be right back.
[20:28.320 --> 20:55.960]  We'll be right back.
[20:58.320 --> 21:02.080]  So I say to Mark at lunch, look, you know, I keep hearing from the government that, you
[21:02.080 --> 21:04.280]  know, they're worried someday ISIS may get here.
[21:04.280 --> 21:10.200]  And I go, Doug, Garland, Texas, Mohammed cartoon shooting, ISIS is already here.
[21:10.200 --> 21:12.400]  I'm not waiting for these people to defend me.
[21:12.400 --> 21:15.400]  If they don't know ISIS as you already, they got no clue.
[21:15.400 --> 21:17.000]  I'm taking care of myself.
[21:17.000 --> 21:21.840]  Guns80.com, AR-15 kits, 30 shot magazines, great prices.

[23:56.520 --> 24:16.040]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show and this Monday, July 27, 2015, I'm David Knight, your
[24:16.040 --> 24:17.040]  host in Austin.
[24:17.040 --> 24:20.200]  We're going to be talking to Alex Jones in the next hour.
[24:20.200 --> 24:21.560]  We have a live report from him.
[24:21.560 --> 24:22.560]  He's in London.
[24:22.560 --> 24:27.320]  He's investigating the globalist takeover of Europe and of course there's many different
[24:27.320 --> 24:28.320]  aspects to it.
[24:28.320 --> 24:30.680]  There's what we see happening with Greece.
[24:30.680 --> 24:35.320]  There's also the transatlantic partnership that is coming up along with the trans-Pacific
[24:35.320 --> 24:39.080]  partnership because the United States is right in the middle.
[24:39.080 --> 24:43.200]  We're a part of the North American Union and we're kind of the spine for these other two
[24:43.200 --> 24:48.920]  wings that are coming in as Zbigniew Brzezinski created this talking about the Trilateral
[24:48.920 --> 24:49.920]  Commission.
[24:49.920 --> 24:54.200]  Also, we have Paul Joseph Watson will be joining us later in the show as well.
[24:54.200 --> 24:59.840]  I want to go back to Hillary Clinton and I want to tell you who her latest corporate
[24:59.840 --> 25:01.600]  sponsors are.
[25:01.600 --> 25:06.200]  Very interesting story behind that for the people on the left that should give them some
[25:06.200 --> 25:07.400]  chills.
[25:07.400 --> 25:10.920]  Before we do though, I'll let you know this half hour of the Alex Jones Show is brought
[25:10.920 --> 25:16.760]  to you by our newest flagship product from InfoWars Life and that is Deep Cleanse.
[25:16.760 --> 25:21.360]  Deep Cleanse is an all-in-one total body cleanser, uses nano-colloidal zeolites.
[25:21.360 --> 25:27.520]  Let's think of that as kind of small nano-sized sponges and other organic ingredients in
[25:27.520 --> 25:31.000]  order to cleanse chemicals and toxic metals from your body.
[25:31.000 --> 25:36.880]  With all the toxic pesticides, herbicides, fungicides and metals in our food supply,
[25:36.880 --> 25:39.680]  Deep Cleanse is a great way to fight back.
[25:39.680 --> 25:41.960]  Right now you can get it at InfoWarsLife.com.
[25:41.960 --> 25:42.960]  We just introduced this.
[25:42.960 --> 25:44.640]  The first day it sold about half of them.
[25:44.640 --> 25:48.600]  We now have sold out about 85% of the first run.
[25:48.600 --> 25:54.800]  It'll be months before we get the next shipment in but you can get yours right now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[25:54.800 --> 25:58.200]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[25:58.200 --> 26:02.480]  Now going back to what we were talking about just before the break, Hillary Clinton's emails.
[26:02.480 --> 26:07.120]  She said, I'm confident that I never sent or received any information that was classified
[26:07.120 --> 26:08.120]  at the time.
[26:08.120 --> 26:12.360]  See all the different pervercations in there, the different qualifications that she puts
[26:12.360 --> 26:13.360]  in there.
[26:13.360 --> 26:15.640]  A lot of people are not buying it.
[26:15.640 --> 26:17.760]  A lot of whistleblowers aren't buying it.
[26:17.760 --> 26:19.320]  Lawyers for whistleblowers aren't buying it.
[26:19.320 --> 26:24.760]  Jesslyn Radek, lawyer for Snowden, lawyer for Thomas Drake, I believe she was a lawyer
[26:24.760 --> 26:25.760]  for William Benny.
[26:25.760 --> 26:27.880]  She was a lawyer for a lot of the NSA whistleblowers.
[26:27.880 --> 26:32.000]  She was a whistleblower herself from the Justice Department, I think.
[26:32.000 --> 26:39.120]  She pointed out that people have been prosecuted for releasing information that was classified
[26:39.120 --> 26:41.720]  both before and after it was classified.
[26:41.720 --> 26:45.360]  In other words, in the case of Thomas Drake, what they came after him, what they tried to
[26:45.360 --> 26:51.800]  convict him for were documents that were not anything that should have ever been classified.
[26:51.800 --> 26:56.640]  They weren't classified when he had them at his home.
[26:56.640 --> 27:01.440]  They went back retroactively and classified those documents as a way to entrap him.
[27:01.440 --> 27:07.040]  Now, that's not the case with Hillary Clinton, but she is trying to spend this this way.
[27:07.040 --> 27:12.600]  But I want you to understand who really is behind Clinton.
[27:12.600 --> 27:17.920]  We've already reported about how Monsanto, ExxonMobil, Microsoft, the telecom industry
[27:17.920 --> 27:24.440]  are bundling money thousands of times more money than they tried to get criminal convictions
[27:24.440 --> 27:28.520]  on and did get a criminal eviction on Dinesh D'Souza.
[27:28.520 --> 27:33.200]  Now, Dinesh kind of skirted the exact rules.
[27:33.200 --> 27:37.760]  He didn't do all the reporting, there's a limit of 5,000 per person.
[27:37.760 --> 27:39.520]  But there are certainly ways to get around it.
[27:39.520 --> 27:43.640]  Tens of millions of dollars are coming from the corporate lobbyists who are bundling these
[27:43.640 --> 27:46.520]  contributions from these corporations.
[27:46.520 --> 27:52.920]  As I've always said, it was H.L. Minkin who said an election is an advanced auction of
[27:52.920 --> 27:53.920]  stolen goods.
[27:53.920 --> 27:58.320]  Those stolen goods are going to be coming from you, the taxpayer.
[27:58.320 --> 28:04.320]  So right now, who is auctioning off getting at your money in the future under these politicians?
[28:04.320 --> 28:09.560]  Well, for Hillary Clinton, besides those corporations I just mentioned, lobbyists for two major
[28:09.560 --> 28:14.080]  prison companies are now serving as top fundraisers for Hillary Clinton.
[28:14.080 --> 28:16.400]  Because that's big business in America.
[28:16.400 --> 28:19.560]  The prison industrial complex is huge.
[28:19.560 --> 28:24.720]  Corrections corporations of America and the geo group both see their fortunes turning
[28:24.720 --> 28:28.000]  if there are fewer people to lock up in the future.
[28:28.000 --> 28:29.000]  No worry about that.
[28:29.000 --> 28:32.120]  That's from Liberty Blutzkrieg.
[28:32.120 --> 28:33.120]  No worry about that.
[28:33.120 --> 28:38.120]  Of course, we have the largest prison population in the world, right?
[28:38.120 --> 28:41.760]  In terms, any way that you want to measure it, in terms of absolute numbers, in terms
[28:41.760 --> 28:47.200]  of percentage of the people that we have locked up, we have a massive number of people.
[28:47.200 --> 28:52.360]  And of course, at the root of that, just like at the root of much of our violent crime, much
[28:52.360 --> 28:56.760]  of the concerns about what's happening at the open borders, at the root of that is the
[28:56.760 --> 29:02.080]  war on drugs that nobody wants to talk about because it's now become an accepted way of
[29:02.080 --> 29:03.080]  American life.
[29:03.080 --> 29:04.720]  Well, I don't accept it.
[29:04.720 --> 29:05.800]  You shouldn't accept it.
[29:05.800 --> 29:07.720]  We ought to understand that it is a failure.
[29:07.720 --> 29:11.280]  And let's just look at the prison statistics that are coming out.
[29:11.280 --> 29:17.480]  We got a new study that says the US prison system is an epic failure and it is a factory
[29:17.480 --> 29:19.160]  for creating criminals.
[29:19.160 --> 29:20.480]  This is from the Free Thought Project.
[29:20.480 --> 29:26.000]  They say a new study from the University of Michigan says that the longer the term served,
[29:26.000 --> 29:28.360]  the higher rate of reconvicted felons.
[29:28.360 --> 29:35.040]  They say for every year spent in prison, there's a 12.5% increase and they go on to commit
[29:35.040 --> 29:37.600]  more serious crime.
[29:37.600 --> 29:42.240]  Yet, 23% are only actual criminals.
[29:42.240 --> 29:46.800]  Most of the people, 77% had no victims that are in our prisons.
[29:46.800 --> 29:49.600]  Say what this will be right back with special report, Alex Jones.
[29:49.600 --> 29:58.800]  The Empires on the Run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:58.800 --> 30:02.880]  A group called Concerned Citizens is petitioning an Iowa school district to prevent students
[30:02.880 --> 30:05.200]  from attending a conference on bullying.
[30:05.200 --> 30:08.520]  The conference was set up by an activist group called Iowa Safe Schools.
[30:08.520 --> 30:12.000]  It was the content of the conference held in April, which has parents up in arms.
[30:12.000 --> 30:15.240]  Among the nearly two dozen speakers, only two addressed bullying.
[30:15.240 --> 30:18.920]  The rest of the sessions involved issues such as how to pleasure their gay partners.
[30:18.920 --> 30:22.520]  Middle school girls learned how to sow fake testicles into their underwear in order to
[30:22.520 --> 30:24.320]  pass themselves off as boys.
[30:24.320 --> 30:28.440]  And the featured speaker, drag performer Miss Coco Peru, cursed a lot and encouraged
[30:28.440 --> 30:32.120]  attendees to vandalize the property of LGBT critics.
[30:32.120 --> 30:33.600]  One parent summed it up like this.
[30:33.600 --> 30:34.920]  It wasn't really on bullying.
[30:34.920 --> 30:37.640]  It was basically a sex ed class for same sex couples.
[30:37.640 --> 30:41.880]  Nate Monson, executive director of Iowa Safe Schools, said in response to the parents,
[30:41.880 --> 30:45.280]  it's incredibly frustrating that adults are being the problem and being the bully.
[30:45.280 --> 30:46.560]  We can do better in Iowa.
[30:46.560 --> 30:50.800]  The real plan is to sexualize your kids so more abortions can be performed.
[30:50.800 --> 30:54.100]  If you want to go deeper into the rabbit hole, check out the video, How Many People Would
[30:54.100 --> 30:58.720]  You Kill For A Million Dollars on the Alex Jones Channel and Infowars.com.

[32:28.480 --> 32:29.480]  Alex Jones here.
[32:29.480 --> 32:33.840]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionist, and chemist
[32:33.840 --> 32:39.360]  to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[32:39.360 --> 32:44.800]  Using the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend, experience the benefits of combining
[32:44.800 --> 32:51.160]  over 14 ancient herbs and extracts with exciting new advances in nutraceutical science.
[32:51.160 --> 32:56.040]  Visit InfowarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[32:56.040 --> 33:19.120]  That's InfowarsLife.com.
[33:19.120 --> 33:25.840]  In the last few years, basically every day,
[33:25.840 --> 33:37.080]  I have spent many, many minutes, in some cases hours, thinking about one concept, a concept
[33:37.080 --> 33:53.040]  that overall eclipses and basically renders null and void all of the globalist attempts
[33:53.040 --> 34:06.480]  to shudder the minds and the windows of perception of the humans living on the face of this globe.
[34:06.480 --> 34:13.400]  Everything we see the establishment doing is about narrowing perception and about basically
[34:13.400 --> 34:17.640]  confusing and confounding and dumbing down the people.
[34:17.640 --> 34:27.840]  And I know all of that goes without saying, but when I talk about this concept, it's important
[34:27.840 --> 34:38.520]  to understand that the concept itself is about transcending the controlled paradigms or the
[34:38.520 --> 34:46.880]  false maps of the mind that have been created by the globalist social engineers.
[34:46.880 --> 34:51.040]  And the point I'm making has been made many different times throughout history.
[34:51.040 --> 34:56.520]  It's just important to note now that with technology and mass media in the last hundred
[34:56.520 --> 35:10.720]  years, there has been a successful move to actually build a physical cave of Plato to
[35:10.720 --> 35:16.760]  which the general public can be inserted into and then dumbed down.
[35:16.760 --> 35:22.160]  And an example of this is when the general public sees this little speech I'm giving,
[35:22.160 --> 35:26.840]  a lot of them will make a joke in the YouTube comments that this guy is talking about caves
[35:26.840 --> 35:27.840]  made out of Plato.
[35:27.840 --> 35:32.920]  And of course, I was talking about Plato and his allegory of the cave.
[35:32.920 --> 35:37.400]  And whereas we can laugh at those people, we have to understand that they are victims
[35:37.400 --> 35:41.000]  of the cave itself.
[35:41.000 --> 35:51.520]  And so never before has there been a true pre-matrix or proto-matrix being built to
[35:51.520 --> 36:00.120]  swallow and restrict human development, human renaissance.
[36:00.120 --> 36:08.000]  The entire New World Order structure, in their own words, is about overthrowing the renaissance.
[36:08.000 --> 36:15.640]  It is about taking the printing press of Gutenberg 500-plus years ago that empowered the people
[36:15.640 --> 36:21.920]  and caused the greatest spread of technology, information, understanding, literature, poetry,
[36:21.920 --> 36:32.000]  enlightenment, culture, music, and inverting that into using media today to destroy minds.
[36:32.000 --> 36:36.640]  We've never had so much information, so much knowledge of our fingertips, and most people
[36:36.640 --> 36:39.040]  take it for granted.
[36:39.040 --> 36:44.520]  Most people are so drunk on entertainment that when real crises happen or a real woman
[36:44.520 --> 36:51.480]  gets run over out in the street, folks don't go over and help them at record levels.
[36:51.480 --> 36:58.080]  People are not rendering aid because their mind basically just sees it as more fiction.
[36:58.080 --> 37:08.200]  We are a world of spectators, but the world isn't really a stage, and each of us players
[37:08.200 --> 37:09.680]  upon it.
[37:09.680 --> 37:14.560]  There is an element of fiction, but fiction generally only reflects the hopes and dreams
[37:14.560 --> 37:16.240]  and fears of the people.
[37:16.240 --> 37:18.440]  It is not the reality.
[37:18.440 --> 37:22.320]  In advertising, they teach you that perception is reality.
[37:22.320 --> 37:24.120]  No, it's not.
[37:24.120 --> 37:29.960]  If a man takes PCP and goes up on top of a 50-story building and believes he's a falcon
[37:29.960 --> 37:36.280]  and jumps off, while he's falling, he may think he's flying, but it only takes five,
[37:36.280 --> 37:42.440]  ten seconds before he hits the bottom, and his consciousness is snuffed out.
[37:42.440 --> 37:47.280]  So in truth, perception is not reality.
[37:47.280 --> 37:53.040]  And the laws of physics end of gravity, and the laws of social justice are not suspended
[37:53.040 --> 37:57.600]  just because the establishment wishes they would be.
[37:57.600 --> 38:01.240]  The establishment is threatened by remissants, they are threatened by legitimate culture,
[38:01.240 --> 38:04.520]  that's why they try to dominate it and control it.
[38:04.520 --> 38:09.840]  And the larger point I'm getting here today is I filled up probably five or six notebooks
[38:09.840 --> 38:17.080]  with points on this poll discussion, and I've never really done a piece on it because it's
[38:17.080 --> 38:25.160]  so huge and so voluminous and so universal that it's too big a subject to ever, in my
[38:25.160 --> 38:28.200]  view, cover properly.
[38:28.200 --> 38:33.480]  And in that is the paradox, because you can cover something very short and sweet with
[38:33.480 --> 38:39.440]  poetry or a picture can tell a thousand words, and so in truth, so many of us taken back
[38:39.440 --> 38:45.400]  who are marveling at consciousness and this incredible universe don't then articulate
[38:45.400 --> 38:52.640]  what we're seeing because we feel like we're not giving it justice and we're humble.
[38:52.640 --> 38:57.160]  But it's those of us that love beauty, love justice, love truth, love honor.
[38:57.160 --> 39:03.320]  It's up to us to realize that the evil people, the control freaks, are threatened by the
[39:03.320 --> 39:10.280]  larger universe, they're not enraptured by it, they're not brought to their knees by
[39:10.280 --> 39:16.120]  the beauty of it, they hate it and wish to build their own little universes in which
[39:16.120 --> 39:20.320]  we're forcibly inserted so they can play God.
[39:20.320 --> 39:24.040]  It's better to reign in hell than to serve in heaven, it was once said.
[39:24.040 --> 39:28.280]  Well, I don't agree with that statement, it's better to be part of heaven than to construct
[39:28.280 --> 39:29.280]  your own hell.
[39:29.280 --> 39:35.680]  Yes, I could be the king of a closet and imagine that I'm the ruler of the universe.
[39:35.680 --> 39:36.680]  That's a delusion.
[39:36.680 --> 39:41.600]  I'm still not really king of anything, but I could walk out in a wider world and have
[39:41.600 --> 39:48.240]  free association and can build things and work with people and share experiences and
[39:48.240 --> 39:50.480]  learn from others, they can learn from me.
[39:50.480 --> 39:54.280]  That is communal, that is kinship, that is transcendent.
[39:54.280 --> 40:01.120]  And what I'm getting at is this, getting outside the box, transcendent and globalist, realizing
[40:01.120 --> 40:05.880]  what they're doing, seeing how big and beautiful the universe is, understanding they're not
[40:05.880 --> 40:14.480]  in control, they only want to be, understanding how weak evil is, is the key to freedom.
[40:14.480 --> 40:16.200]  But there are twin keys.
[40:16.200 --> 40:21.440]  First you must realize how weak evil is once you've awakened.
[40:21.440 --> 40:23.160]  But that's really the first key.
[40:23.160 --> 40:30.800]  You've got to admit that there is bad energy, bad people, corrupt forces in the world that
[40:30.800 --> 40:38.240]  are going to have to be met and faced and then only can the journey of human empowerment
[40:38.240 --> 40:40.240]  begin.
[40:40.240 --> 40:45.280]  And so while I'm in Europe, covering what's happening in England, covering what's happening
[40:45.280 --> 40:50.040]  in Spain, in Greece, in Italy, as they say Rome is set to collapse and the one in Telegraph
[40:50.040 --> 40:58.120]  and other publications, as I check this out for myself and you the viewers and readers
[40:58.120 --> 41:02.840]  and listeners, we will be reporting on the road about what's currently happening, but
[41:02.840 --> 41:09.880]  also always tying it into context of the wider universe.
[41:09.880 --> 41:15.960]  The incredible adventure that it is to be conscious, that it is to be alive, to be born,
[41:15.960 --> 41:22.720]  to have those experiences, to have friends, to have family, to go through your struggles,
[41:22.720 --> 41:24.440]  to be involved.
[41:24.440 --> 41:32.680]  Life is all about trailblazing, it's all about experiences, but Hollywood in this false culture
[41:32.680 --> 41:37.320]  builds up an image that only superheroes can do great things.
[41:37.320 --> 41:42.880]  Only Arnold Schwarzenegger can defeat the bad guys and that it's always one man or one
[41:42.880 --> 41:44.680]  woman that does it all.
[41:44.680 --> 41:51.400]  And the truth is, it's all of us together collectively doing little things that moves
[41:51.400 --> 41:58.680]  the world and it is in that moment of wonder, looking up from the New World Order, looking
[41:58.680 --> 42:02.840]  up from all their propaganda, looking up from all the bizarre things they're distracting
[42:02.840 --> 42:08.120]  us with and staring out into the heavens and staring out into the desert night sky and
[42:08.120 --> 42:13.280]  staring out across the Atlantic Ocean or the Pacific Ocean or staring into the eyes of
[42:13.280 --> 42:18.280]  your child or staring into the eyes of your wife or husband, it is only in that moment
[42:18.280 --> 42:25.520]  that we can pull back and be separate from the evil that wishes to envelop us and control
[42:25.520 --> 42:27.680]  our free will.
[42:27.680 --> 42:31.920]  So I have five or six notebooks filled and they're at the office, they're at my house,
[42:31.920 --> 42:35.760]  they're, I'm always running into another one that I've forgotten I had where I just try
[42:35.760 --> 42:40.360]  to write down what I think is amazing, what I think is incredible.
[42:40.360 --> 42:45.160]  And it's just so hard because once you start thinking about what a miracle everything is
[42:45.160 --> 42:53.400]  and all the mysteries, it just completely blows you away and then you realize what a
[42:53.400 --> 42:59.760]  joke the technocrats are trying to play God, you realize what a fraud they are.
[42:59.760 --> 43:04.680]  I think it's important to do a couple of things, this is my view you can comment below or make
[43:04.680 --> 43:08.840]  your own videos or call into the show and tell us what you think, David Knight can comment
[43:08.840 --> 43:14.760]  coming up here on the radio show and TV show what he thinks, but we've got to be appreciative,
[43:14.760 --> 43:21.120]  we've got to be thankful, we've got to be humble, and we've also got to repent even
[43:21.120 --> 43:22.920]  if you don't believe in God.
[43:22.920 --> 43:28.240]  We've got to say sorry to our friends and family, sorry to ourselves, sorry to the universe
[43:28.240 --> 43:34.240]  that we didn't appreciate this more and that we were hateful, we were greedy, we were spoiled,
[43:34.240 --> 43:37.240]  we were petulant.
[43:37.240 --> 43:42.080]  And with that comes great wisdom and again a lot of what I've said has been said by
[43:42.080 --> 43:46.640]  the ancients, it's been said in modern times, it's been known, but no one who's tuned in
[43:46.640 --> 43:51.320]  can deny that great evil is growing, great darkness is growing.
[43:51.320 --> 43:59.440]  I describe evil as false data, as viruses, as systems of fraud that build false, many
[43:59.440 --> 44:12.880]  paradigms that disease the universe itself, it's a false logic, it's a twisted view that
[44:12.880 --> 44:21.080]  seeks to overturn the mind because a common mind itself, not even the greatest of minds
[44:21.080 --> 44:26.600]  is much greater than the mind of those that consciously have some knowledge of reality
[44:26.600 --> 44:36.240]  and choose to use that knowledge not to empower others, but to indunge and enslave those because
[44:36.240 --> 44:40.320]  they're threatened by free will, they are monopoly men, they just don't want monopoly
[44:40.320 --> 44:45.880]  over healthcare, monopoly over your life or private property or monopoly over our families,
[44:45.880 --> 44:53.440]  they want monopoly over free will, over consciousness, and this system is threatened by the beauty
[44:53.440 --> 44:58.480]  that is the free soul and that's why we're moving into the age of the machines, that's
[44:58.480 --> 45:03.760]  why they're moving into the age of saying humans are ugly, defunct, obsolete and done
[45:03.760 --> 45:10.800]  because to the technocrats whose souls from inbreeding and corruption and past crimes
[45:10.800 --> 45:20.440]  are so bionic, so cold, so reptile that to them are burning, flaming, free, hot-blooded
[45:20.440 --> 45:30.800]  souls are like daggers on chalkboards, they're like a clamor, to us it sounds like angels
[45:30.800 --> 45:37.360]  to them that is hell and so these two will not mix and we've reached the twilight point
[45:37.360 --> 45:44.360]  in civilization, is it the dawn of a new system and a new chance for a future or is it the
[45:44.360 --> 45:51.120]  twilight, the Gududamuram, the fall of humanity, the globalists say the time of man has come
[45:51.120 --> 46:00.440]  to an end, they say in the archetype that the castle will fall because they're so threatened
[46:00.440 --> 46:05.840]  by the fact that it's just begun to rise, in my heart, in my soul, I know humanity will
[46:05.840 --> 46:12.280]  survive, it may just be a small part of us and it may not even be on this planet but
[46:12.280 --> 46:15.120]  our destiny lies in the stars.
[46:15.120 --> 46:19.320]  Back to the live transmission and more of my live reports from the road, we now go to
[46:19.320 --> 46:25.520]  David Knight and the InfoWars News Center that you, the InfoWarriors, built.
[46:25.520 --> 46:29.760]  And again that's Alex Jones who is in England right now, he's investigating the globalist
[46:29.760 --> 46:33.560]  takeover of Europe, he's going to be calling in with a live report later in the show and
[46:33.560 --> 46:39.000]  we're also going to be talking to Paul Joseph Watson, I want to get back to Hillary's prison
[46:39.000 --> 46:45.000]  connection and how that's affecting her campaign, her support.
[46:45.000 --> 46:50.600]  There's an amazing story though that is just coming out of Georgia about a guy getting
[46:50.600 --> 46:56.040]  sued for publishing Georgia laws online, what does that tell us?
[46:56.040 --> 47:00.160]  That's just absolutely amazing, before I get to that, this hour of the Alex Jones show
[47:00.160 --> 47:05.480]  however is made possible by Survival Shield X2, it's one of the products that helps to
[47:05.480 --> 47:11.400]  support InfoWars.com, all the products that we sell at InfoWarsLife.com help to support
[47:11.400 --> 47:12.400]  the operation.
[47:12.400 --> 47:20.040]  We'd like to give you healthy, win-win situation products that will help you with your health,
[47:20.040 --> 47:25.480]  help you to provide for your family in a way that you're not going to get otherwise.
[47:25.480 --> 47:30.360]  Things like Survival Shield X2, nascent iodine, it's something I take every day, it's something
[47:30.360 --> 47:33.760]  I like because it's in a liquid form, it's very easy for me to take a lot of liquid
[47:33.760 --> 47:38.960]  supplements all at once, I know that they're very available to me, it's not something that
[47:38.960 --> 47:41.640]  has to be digested like a pill.
[47:41.640 --> 47:47.000]  But look for yourself, go to InfoWarsLife.com, we've got 400 reviews there, it's a great
[47:47.000 --> 47:51.120]  way to decide what works for you, what works in your life.
[47:51.120 --> 47:53.920]  You can see some of these reviews, here's one of them.
[47:53.920 --> 47:59.600]  This is from Eileen in Akron, Ohio, she says I've been taking X2 for six weeks, I've lost
[47:59.600 --> 48:04.440]  approximately 20 pounds, have stronger hair and nails, better skin and muscle tone, I
[48:04.440 --> 48:09.440]  can now walk briskly for two miles, the last quarter mile she says is all uphill, hardly
[48:09.440 --> 48:10.440]  breaking a sweat.
[48:10.440 --> 48:15.280]  I can honestly say I feel better now than I did 20 years ago, thanks AJ and Dr. Group
[48:15.280 --> 48:18.600]  for bringing this product to the rest of us.
[48:18.600 --> 48:24.680]  We have as I said over 400 reviews there, over 99% of those would recommend it to families
[48:24.680 --> 48:25.680]  and friends.
[48:25.680 --> 48:31.040]  Again, get your bottle of X2 while it's in stock, like all of our products, it goes in
[48:31.040 --> 48:34.600]  and out of stock pretty regularly, it's in stock right now and again we're very close
[48:34.600 --> 48:38.120]  to the end of free shipping for the month of July.
[48:38.120 --> 48:43.360]  So stock up on X2 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[48:43.360 --> 48:46.440]  Now before I go to the story about Georgia, I just want to finish with what I was talking
[48:46.440 --> 48:49.600]  about of course with the prisons and we've mentioned this many times about how so many
[48:49.600 --> 48:57.120]  people, such a large percentage of people in our prisons are there as nonviolent offenders.
[48:57.120 --> 49:00.520]  People that were put there because we have mandatory minimums that were put in as part
[49:00.520 --> 49:06.000]  of the drug war back in the 1980s by Ronald Reagan and of course Republicans and Democrats
[49:06.000 --> 49:07.240]  have left that in.
[49:07.240 --> 49:08.240]  Why is it?
[49:08.240 --> 49:09.240]  Is it working?
[49:09.240 --> 49:11.000]  Do we have less drugs?
[49:11.000 --> 49:12.960]  Do we have less drug cartels?
[49:12.960 --> 49:15.520]  Do we have less violence and crime?
[49:15.520 --> 49:16.880]  No we have more.
[49:16.880 --> 49:18.000]  We have more use.
[49:18.000 --> 49:19.080]  We have more crime.
[49:19.080 --> 49:20.560]  We have more corruption.
[49:20.560 --> 49:28.600]  This is a failed policy unless you understand that this is a wealth transfer from the American
[49:28.600 --> 49:31.120]  taxpayers to these prison corporations.
[49:31.120 --> 49:37.520]  And as I pointed out in the last segment, besides the typical usual suspects like Monsanto,
[49:37.520 --> 49:42.800]  ExxonMobil, Microsoft, the telecom industry all giving money to Hillary Clinton, now we've
[49:42.800 --> 49:49.960]  got major prison companies bundling millions of dollars for Hillary Clinton.
[49:49.960 --> 49:58.640]  See there's $6.9 billion, they say, has been spent on prisons and they say this is a growing
[49:58.640 --> 49:59.640]  crisis.
[49:59.640 --> 50:05.520]  Well, yeah, it's not really a crisis except for those of us who have to live under it.
[50:05.520 --> 50:12.040]  For the corporations, for the politicians that these corporations sponsor, it's an opportunity.
[50:12.040 --> 50:15.640]  It's not a crisis, it's an opportunity.
[50:15.640 --> 50:19.360]  Understand that, of course, in jail, people die from drug overdoses.
[50:19.360 --> 50:23.120]  I don't believe that Sandra Bland died from an overdose of marijuana.
[50:23.120 --> 50:24.600]  I don't find that credible at all.
[50:24.600 --> 50:29.120]  She was there for three days and they say that she hung herself with some plastic baggies
[50:29.120 --> 50:30.960]  because she died of an overdose.
[50:30.960 --> 50:34.800]  There are people who go to prison and die of drug overdoses.
[50:34.800 --> 50:40.560]  There's a report here, 346 inmates die in Florida and if you look at those stories, those are
[50:40.560 --> 50:48.080]  not drug overdoses, most of those are recriminations from the people running the prison.
[50:48.080 --> 50:51.080]  Stay with us when we come back, I'm going to get to that story about what's going on
[50:51.080 --> 50:52.080]  in Georgia.
[50:52.080 --> 50:59.080]  We'll be right back.
[50:59.080 --> 51:03.320]  In recent years, we have witnessed the most catastrophic disasters in history.
[51:03.320 --> 51:07.240]  Earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, typhoons and more.
[51:07.240 --> 51:10.040]  Legacy premium food storage will prepare you.

[51:15.720 --> 51:18.520]  on the market and are American made.

[52:26.800 --> 52:27.800]  Come and take it.
[52:27.800 --> 52:29.480]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[52:29.480 --> 52:33.160]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold
[52:33.160 --> 52:34.160]  IRAs?
[52:34.160 --> 52:38.600]  It's been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold
[52:38.600 --> 52:39.760]  for your retirement.
[52:39.760 --> 52:43.160]  Gold is outperformed paper investments yet no word about IRAs.
[52:43.160 --> 52:48.080]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[52:48.080 --> 52:53.920]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation in low returns, call 800-686-2237.

[54:05.720 --> 54:18.200]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[54:18.200 --> 54:21.640]  As you hear the theme from the Outer Limits, we really have reached the outer limits of
[54:21.640 --> 54:26.080]  cynicism, of corruption, of contempt for the public.
[54:26.080 --> 54:29.240]  Listen to this story from the state of Georgia.
[54:29.240 --> 54:34.880]  They're suing a man for publishing Georgia laws on the Internet.
[54:34.880 --> 54:40.720]  Now, we've gotten kind of used to the government producing things like we just saw this last
[54:40.720 --> 54:41.720]  week.
[54:41.720 --> 54:47.800]  The dark act, as activists have pointed out, the idea that they would shut down any labeling
[54:47.800 --> 54:53.400]  laws that are state or local at the federal level, shutting down the idea that we would
[54:53.400 --> 54:59.320]  be allowed to know if there's genetically modified stuff in our food.
[54:59.320 --> 55:03.600]  There's over 3,000 ingredients that if you put these ingredients in your food, it has
[55:03.600 --> 55:06.520]  to go on the label from the FDA.
[55:06.520 --> 55:09.920]  But of course, we're not allowed to know about genetically modified foods.
[55:09.920 --> 55:12.320]  These are things that are constantly changing, unlike these other chemicals.
[55:12.320 --> 55:18.280]  I mean, they're not constantly changing most of these ingredients, but to say that something
[55:18.280 --> 55:23.880]  is genetically modified, they are constantly doing different genetic modifications.
[55:23.880 --> 55:26.280]  So it's something I personally would like to know.
[55:26.280 --> 55:31.640]  People are free to look at this and disregard it or whatever, but so activists have looked
[55:31.640 --> 55:34.040]  at this and said, this is the dark act.
[55:34.040 --> 55:37.560]  You are shutting us out of this information.
[55:37.560 --> 55:39.160]  You're keeping this information from us.
[55:39.160 --> 55:43.760]  But of course, Congress calls it not the dark act, they call it the safe and accurate food
[55:43.760 --> 55:51.000]  labeling act, accurate food labeling when they prohibit the labeling of ingredients.
[55:51.000 --> 55:56.320]  See, that's the kind of stuff we see with the USA Freedom Act, where they extended spying
[55:56.320 --> 55:58.920]  on the American public or the Patriot Act.
[55:58.920 --> 56:04.600]  We've talked about that for decades or the FISA Act, which was set up for foreign intelligence
[56:04.600 --> 56:08.240]  surveillance used as a rubber stamp for domestic surveillance.
[56:08.240 --> 56:13.760]  See, the FISA Act was set up to specifically prohibit domestic spying and now it's being
[56:13.760 --> 56:17.040]  used as a rubber stamp for domestic spying.
[56:17.040 --> 56:18.040]  So we see that all the time.
[56:18.040 --> 56:22.840]  But now Georgia takes it to new obvious outer limits.
[56:22.840 --> 56:23.840]  Here we go.
[56:23.840 --> 56:31.320]  The state of Georgia is suing the owner of publicresource.org for publishing the state
[56:31.320 --> 56:35.040]  of Georgia's own laws online.
[56:35.040 --> 56:40.680]  The guy has a website as Carl Malamud, he has, quote, engaged in an 18-year-long crusade
[56:40.680 --> 56:46.080]  to control the accessibility of US government documents by becoming the United States public
[56:46.080 --> 56:47.080]  printer.
[56:47.080 --> 56:50.440]  He argues the law should not be subject to any form of copyright.
[56:50.440 --> 56:52.440]  Yeah, that's the interesting thing.
[56:52.440 --> 56:55.320]  That's the angle at which they're coming after him.
[56:55.320 --> 57:00.760]  They're saying, you're violating our copyright, the laws of our copyright.
[57:00.760 --> 57:05.880]  I guess when you look at it, I guess they're written by corporations, so I guess the corporations
[57:05.880 --> 57:09.640]  who write our laws should be able to claim copyright on it, right?
[57:09.640 --> 57:13.400]  Isn't that what Alec is about, the American Legislative Exchange Council?
[57:13.400 --> 57:20.600]  I mean, these guys literally, literally write the laws that go to these lavish conventions
[57:20.600 --> 57:24.280]  with the legislators from various states, especially from Georgia.
[57:24.280 --> 57:29.120]  That was one of the ones that figured prominently in a recent report about the corruption where
[57:29.120 --> 57:33.680]  these corporations write the laws that are going to benefit the corporations.
[57:33.680 --> 57:37.280]  They fill that out completely, but they just leave a couple of blanks, one at the top to
[57:37.280 --> 57:40.960]  fill in the name of the state, and another one at the bottom for these guys to all sign
[57:40.960 --> 57:45.240]  on to it, kind of like the Trans-Pacific, Transatlantic partnerships that they're working
[57:45.240 --> 57:46.240]  on.
[57:46.240 --> 57:51.640]  So yeah, I guess maybe they do own the copyright to the laws that the corporations write.
[57:51.640 --> 57:52.640]  But here's what he says.
[57:52.640 --> 57:58.360]  He says it's a long-held tenet of American law that there is no copyright in the law.
[57:58.360 --> 58:01.480]  This is because the law belongs to the people and our system of democracy.
[58:01.480 --> 58:06.280]  We have a right to read, to know, to speak the laws by which we choose to govern ourselves.
[58:06.280 --> 58:09.480]  Well, see, the problem is that we're not choosing the laws.
[58:09.480 --> 58:11.320]  It isn't self-government.
[58:11.320 --> 58:13.120]  The politicians are not elected.
[58:13.120 --> 58:18.480]  They are selected by the corporations who write these laws, who copyright these laws,
[58:18.480 --> 58:23.040]  who sue you if you even publish the laws because you're not supposed to know.
[58:23.040 --> 58:29.520]  And of course, as I mentioned earlier, the IRS can go after people 10, 12 times the fines
[58:29.520 --> 58:33.000]  that were in Obamacare, just whatever they want to do.
[58:33.000 --> 58:34.000]  Stay with us.
[58:34.000 --> 58:35.000]  We'll be right back.
[58:35.000 --> 58:37.480]  We're going to start talking about future wars.
[58:37.480 --> 58:38.480]  Stay with us.
[58:38.480 --> 58:39.480]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[58:39.480 --> 58:40.480]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:40.480 --> 58:54.160]  Alex Jones here with infowarslife.com, Consumer Alert Report.
[58:54.160 --> 58:59.440]  Many of you are aware that around the world, most populations are woefully deficient in
[58:59.440 --> 59:01.840]  clean forms of iodine.
[59:01.840 --> 59:04.480]  Iodine is the good member of the halogen family.
[59:04.480 --> 59:07.240]  Things like fluoride are the bad halogens.
[59:07.240 --> 59:13.840]  The good news is, our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced
[59:13.840 --> 59:15.320]  it for themselves.
[59:15.320 --> 59:22.880]  The bad news is, the supply of these deep earth crystals, that exclusive 999 pure source
[59:22.880 --> 59:26.880]  is proprietary and only available to infowarslife.com.
[59:26.880 --> 59:30.240]  And that supply is running low and is in question.
[59:30.240 --> 59:34.240]  That's why it's more important than ever to secure your current and longtime supply of
[59:34.240 --> 59:37.280]  survival shield nascent iodine X2 today.

[59:51.360 --> 01:00:04.880]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:09.680]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:10.680]  You want answers?
[01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:17.000]  Well, so does he, he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:22.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:27.840]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:29.360]  I'm your host today, David Knight.
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:34.720]  And Alex is going to be joining us in the, later in the program, live from England.
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:38.920]  He is in Europe investigating globalist takeover of Europe.
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:41.760]  And of course, it's not just Europe that they're going to take over.
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:42.760]  They are globalists.
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:44.120]  They're taking over everything.
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:47.560]  We can see that with the transatlantic, the trans-specific partnerships.
[01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:51.920]  But specifically, Alex is going to be looking at what's going on in some of those countries
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:52.920]  there.
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:53.920]  So he's going to be joining us live.
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:54.920]  We've already had a report from him.
[01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:59.000]  Paul Joseph Watson is also going to be joining us live later in the show.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:05.520]  Now, the last segment, I was talking about the people in Georgia.
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:09.340]  They have Alec writing their laws for them in many cases.
[01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:13.720]  This is a corporation, a lobbyist group that has the corporations write the laws for them.
[01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:14.720]  They just fill them out.
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:22.440]  And then if somebody has the audacity to print or to put the laws online, this man is getting
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:27.360]  sued now by the state of Georgia, saying that they have violated, that he's violated their
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:28.360]  copyrights.
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:34.320]  If you want to know how rampant corporatism is, however, take a look at this article from
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:36.600]  Free Thought Project.
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:43.800]  Scotus Justices, that's the Supreme Court Justices, rule in favor of companies that they own in
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:46.240]  90% of the time.
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:50.440]  Three Supreme Court Justices did not recuse themselves in cases in which they held stock
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:51.440]  in companies.
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:55.640]  Interested in the outcomes, nearly 90% of the time, they sided with those businesses
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:58.440]  that filed friend of the court briefs.
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:04.000]  Now, understand we've had Clarence Thomas, who used to be a corporate lawyer from Monsanto.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:09.560]  We have Kagan, who did not recuse herself from Obamacare any time, even though she was
[01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:12.000]  intimately involved in writing the law.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  We've got Ginsburg and Sotomayor, who had been gay marriage activists.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.360]  They did not recuse themselves.
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:18.760]  Why is all this important?
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:23.040]  Well, it's important because they're not supposed to have an opinion already.
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:26.840]  They're not supposed to be putting their opinions out there like elected representatives.
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:32.120]  They're supposed to be concentrating simply on the legal facts.
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:33.800]  That's what they're supposed to be deciding on.
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:38.760]  They're not supposed to have already picked the side in this or be subjected to this.
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:43.880]  But you know, we really have just two branches now of the judiciary.
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:49.160]  We've got the echo chamber like this, and we also have the star chamber, the FISA court.
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:55.080]  As I mentioned in the last segment, of course, the FISA court is not even really a court.
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:57.520]  It's a single judge.
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:59.760]  There's no adversarial argument there.
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:08.360]  There's no jury, and there is no publishing of the results of the finding of the judge.
[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:13.240]  They maintain in many cases, like the Supreme Court does, that they are modifying our Constitution.
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:16.960]  I disagree with that in both cases, but it's even more egregious in the case of the star
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:19.000]  chamber, the FISA court.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:23.080]  Because they don't even tell us what the supposed modifications to the Constitution are.
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:27.520]  But in the Supreme Court, what we see over and over again is simply an echo chamber.
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:32.680]  Here's a couple of instances, however, of the corporatism that's there.
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:36.800]  Cisco Systems, we have a briar who had $100,000 stake in it.
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:39.880]  That seemed to affect some of his votes, as they point out.
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:46.680]  Roberts, with a $15,000 stake in a company called BioSig, they did not recuse themselves
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:47.680]  from these cases.
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:53.560]  And there's a point out, in 90% of the time, eight out of nine times, they voted for the
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:55.920]  people that they had financial interests in.
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:59.480]  How do you think Hillary Clinton is going to vote when she's given all this money by
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:03.760]  these big corporations, tens of millions, hundreds of millions by the time they get
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:05.760]  to the election?
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:07.080]  Jeb Bush, same way.
[01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:09.240]  All these politicians the same way.
[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:14.160]  And of course, now one of those groups is the prison corporations.
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:17.760]  The prison industrial complex is getting its hooks into Hillary Clinton.
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:21.520]  Maybe that's why you've got these articles like this one from the American Mirror showing
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:26.960]  that nobody is showing up or pulling off the stakes here for Young Americans for Hillary
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:27.960]  Party.
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:28.960]  This is at a college thing.
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:29.960]  You've got a poster here.
[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:35.360]  It says, young people, you can cut Hillary swag, you can get pizza, you can get political
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:36.360]  discussion.
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:39.200]  Well, I wonder why nobody's taking them up on that.
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:44.440]  Another picture here from campusreform.org showing a college Democrat event where there's
[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:48.000]  only two rows of seats in the entire auditorium.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:54.220]  Yeah, people are starting to wake up to the phony campaigns of Hillary Clinton, of Jeb
[01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:56.600]  Bush, of our political royalties.
[01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:57.600]  Stay with us.
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:01.600]  We'll be right back.

[01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:02.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers and sponsors
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:07.440]  on my syndicated radio show or the nightly news or the news website infowars.com because
[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:12.160]  the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality and they weren't as
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:17.440]  affordable as they should be so I refused, probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:24.600]  the years will then, about six months ago, we get contacted by head down firearms, hdfirearms.com.
[01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:28.640]  Own and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, special ops people, their veterans, their
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:32.960]  patriots, their listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:36.880]  It's always about security, whether it's for yourself, your wife, your loved ones.
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:39.240]  Go to their website hdfirearms.com.
[01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:43.720]  Buy right off their website and they'll just send it to the FFL dealer of your choice.
[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:47.040]  You can pick it up at the gun show, you can pick it up at the local sporting goods store,
[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:51.400]  whatever you do, get your head down firearm today.
[01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:58.200]  The spirit of 1776 lives at head down firearms, hdfirearms.com.
[01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:01.600]  A clean, toxic free body is the foundation of true health.
[01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:07.000]  Introducing Deep Cleanse by infowarslife.com, a scientifically formulated blend of nanocoloidal
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.720]  zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic
[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:11.720]  metals.
[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:15.680]  Using on proprietary multi-step extraction technology, Deep Cleanse is our most affordable
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:16.880]  all-in-one cleanser.

[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:26.240]  and others, Deep Cleanse doesn't hold back.
[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:30.280]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades

[01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:13.480]  Please the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:14.980]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:16.480]  I want to get to some good news.
[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:19.680]  We have a lot of bad news, and we're going to give you some more bad news coming up later
[01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:20.680]  in the show.
[01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:21.680]  But let's talk about some good news.
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:25.040]  We're going to talk about some vaccine bills that were killed.
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:29.720]  We're going to talk about some movements in London to try to open up transparency.
[01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:36.320]  I mean, you've got people in Georgia being sued because they put, posted Georgia laws
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:39.040]  or being sued for copyright violations, believe it or not.
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:43.840]  I mean, this is coming right on the heels of our safe and accurate labeling act out
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:44.840]  of Congress.
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:46.720]  Of course, that has not passed.
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:51.160]  When people understand you can still fight this, you need to fight it with your senators.
[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:52.960]  But it did pass through the House.
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:58.120]  A very cynical piece of legislation, basically calling it accurate labeling when they are
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:03.440]  going to prohibit any labeling of GMO in your food.
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:06.760]  They call that safe and accurate labeling act.
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:07.760]  That's how cynical they are.
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:10.880]  But we're going to get to some good news here from London, possibly.
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:13.920]  I think it's a good idea whether or not it goes through there.
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:18.400]  Before we do, just want to let you know that this hour of the Alex Jones show is made possible
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:24.920]  by the products that we sell at InfoWarsLife and InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:27.400]  This segment is brought to you by Clean Water.
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:30.040]  Clean water that you can get for yourself.
[01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:31.440]  Clean water that you can filter.
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:32.840]  You can take the fluoride out.
[01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:34.760]  You can take the glyphosate out.
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:38.460]  You can do it for yourself, for your family.
[01:09:38.460 --> 01:09:42.680]  From fluoride to birth control chemicals, we're constantly being bombarded by toxins
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:44.120]  in our tap water.
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:48.600]  That's why Alex and I both use Pro Pure Water filters from InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:52.680]  I want to tell you about another special we're giving to listeners that will expire in just
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:53.760]  four days.
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:59.560]  Get the new Pro Pure Water picture that filters fluoride for 20% off until the end of June.
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:04.360]  While supplies last, this filter can be used for travel and again, it filters fluoride.
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:08.560]  You can get that at InfoWarsStore.com and get 20% off today.
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:12.480]  It's very important to have something that you can take with you for clean water because
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:16.520]  that's when you're going to really not know what you're getting.
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:19.640]  Usually if you're at home and you're on a well, you need something to take out, the
[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:24.480]  glyphosate that's probably going to be in the aquifer, when you're traveling you want
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:29.000]  to be able to get the toxins that are put out in the municipal water supplies.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000]  Again you can get that at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:37.120]  You can get 20% off of that travel filter, special just for the next four days.
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:43.440]  Now in terms of taking control of our life, some good news on the vaccine front, of course
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:48.880]  we've got bills all across the country trying to take away our exemptions, that's what
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:54.360]  they call it, exemptions because you know, everything nowadays is mandated unless expressly
[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:55.360]  permitted.
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:59.160]  See, that's the America of the 20th and 21st century.
[01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:05.240]  It used to be that we lived in a free country, it used to be everything was permitted unless
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:07.760]  expressly prohibited.
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:13.080]  But now we have turned that upside down, agencies like the FDA, everything is prohibited
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:18.360]  if you're a terminal patient and you want to try some experimental treatment, that's
[01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:23.000]  going to be prohibited to you unless they expressly permitted, especially if it's some
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:29.040]  kind of a treatment that is not being provided by big pharmaceutical companies.
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:33.240]  But when they look at vaccines they say, well we're going to give you exemptions, we'll
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:35.440]  give you a religious exemption, whatever.
[01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:38.240]  No, we have informed consent.
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:45.560]  You need to have our consent before you put stuff in our bodies, it's just that simple.
[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:48.240]  That's where I'm drawing the line, that's where a lot of people are drawing the line,
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:53.920]  this is really going to get quite bad if they get serious about trying to enforce this because
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:57.040]  a lot of us are not going to stand for this.
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:12:00.040]  But in many places it's been defeated.
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:03.600]  These kind of bills, even though they passed in California, they've been defeated in Texas,
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:07.980]  they've been defeated now in Mexico, a bill seeking to take away a parent or guardian's
[01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:12.560]  right to religious exemption to keep their children from being forced to receive immunization
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:14.720]  was just defeated in New Mexico.
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:18.440]  Now, of course, they always come for the children first, don't they?
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:20.080]  We've got to do it for the children.
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:25.040]  We've got to do it for your safety, for security, for national security, except none of these
[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:26.520]  things ever deliver.
[01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:31.320]  And of course, the approach that they're using all across the country, it isn't as if they
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:35.520]  have some kind of a legislative agenda that's been created by a pharmaceutical industry,
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:36.520]  is it?
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:42.560]  While we were just talking about with Alex, with Alec, the American Legislative Exchange
[01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:49.400]  Council, isn't it funny how this just appeared all of a sudden, all across the country?
[01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:52.240]  It's almost as if somebody's writing our laws, isn't it?
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:57.480]  Like Agenda 21, or like the drug war itself, which was written in detail by the United
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:03.920]  Nations 10 years before Nixon declared the war on drugs and put out the four schedules
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:04.920]  of drugs.
[01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:08.240]  That was all written down to the letter by the United Nations.
[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:15.480]  That's why they're jumping in and having fits about decriminalization in Colorado and Washington
[01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:18.840]  and other places, because that's their law.
[01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:20.200]  They think that they own us.
[01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:21.200]  They write these laws.
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:25.480]  And so now we have these mandatory vaccine laws that are being introduced all across
[01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:26.480]  the country.
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:31.960]  But this particular one would have prohibited parents from opting their children out of
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:35.600]  allowing the government, allowing the government, this is the way they put it, would have prohibited
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:39.440]  them from opting out of allowing the government to administer immunization shots to their
[01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:40.440]  children.
[01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:44.560]  Now, this is something in this particular bill that was extremely bad.
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:47.360]  It even included homeschool kids.
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:50.120]  Even in California, they didn't include homeschool kids.
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:53.600]  And that might be one of the reasons that they got away with it.
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:56.280]  Don't worry, they're going to come after the homeschool kids next.
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:14:01.720]  And as soon as they got that passed in California, Dr. Pan, the senator who pushed this through,
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:06.880]  the guy who's a highly paid, who's received a lot of money from, guess who, the pharmaceutical
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:10.760]  industry, he immediately started pushing it in other states, but also saying we now need
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:12.920]  to move to adults.
[01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:18.080]  And they'll move to particular careers, people who are working in healthcare, people who
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:21.360]  are working in rest homes, and then it'll just be universal.
[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:27.200]  And if you don't do it, you're going to be ostracized into some kind of a ghetto.
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:31.640]  But of course, this has been defeated in New Mexico, and that's a good sign.
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:33.600]  Anything else is coming along.
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:34.600]  Something called blockchain.
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:37.840]  Now, if you know anything about Bitcoin, and I don't know a great deal about it, so I'm
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:42.240]  not going to talk a great deal about it, but at the center of Bitcoin is something called
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:43.240]  blockchain.
[01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:49.800]  It's a way to audit, it's a way to verify to the authenticity of these exchanges.
[01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:54.320]  And so it's an audit trail, it's transparent, and it's distributed so that everybody can
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:55.320]  look at it.
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:56.920]  But it also provides a level of anonymity.
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:00.160]  And so a lot of people have started looking at it and saying, maybe this is going to be,
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:03.360]  as you see this article here, a new model of governance.
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:09.360]  Maybe we could use this to, as another level, to verify that the elections aren't rigged,
[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:15.600]  or that the financial transactions in the city of London, for example, aren't rigged.
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:17.920]  Because we've seen massive scandals there.
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:21.200]  Remember the LIBOR exchange, the London Interbank exchange rates?
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:26.240]  The things that set the interest rates for your home, for your car, if you've got a variable
[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:29.160]  rate interest loan, that's tied to the LIBOR exchange.
[01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:31.840]  They've been manipulating that, surprise, surprise.
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:36.720]  Just like they manipulate currency, just like they manipulate commodities, they manipulate
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:37.720]  that.
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:40.320]  They even had a little scheme going with some of these things where they were trading it,
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:46.440]  kind of like if you ever saw the movie The Sting, where they've got that horse race set
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:50.960]  up and they've got it delayed, so they know who the winner is and they place their bets
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:54.160]  and they give a false tip to somebody.
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:55.840]  Basically it was that type of thing.
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:58.520]  They had that also running.
[01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:04.000]  We've got a candidate, somebody named George Galloway who is running for the mayor of London.
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.120]  This is somebody that we've talked to before.
[01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:08.800]  He's a politician in London.
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:13.080]  We talked to him about his investigation into Enron and Kinley.
[01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:18.600]  He was of the opinion that Kinley was not dead, that he had essentially fled to South
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:23.080]  America like Hitler was living a secret life there.
[01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:29.840]  He is running in London for mayor and he brought in Max Kaiser and has an idea about
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:36.080]  how they might use blockchain to make things more open, more transparent, more honest,
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:37.640]  to monitor the city of London.
[01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:41.360]  I want to play you a little bit of this on the street report about his campaign.
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:47.080]  George Galloway, what is your priority when you first, if you are elected into the mayor's
[01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:48.080]  office?
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:51.440]  I'm going to send this man into the square mile into the city of London.
[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:52.440]  He's pointing to Max Kaiser.
[01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:55.240]  He's saying that the party is over.
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:59.880]  Oftentimes governments appoint a czar, education czar, crime czar.
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:00.880]  I don't have a czar.
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:02.760]  I don't like czars.
[01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:09.520]  I have a Kaiser and his level of financial literacy has already got the city slickers
[01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:15.360]  knocking at the knees because they know they can't pull the wool over his eyes.
[01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:19.200]  The second thing I'm going to do is begin a process for the abolition of the city of
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:25.480]  London, special police force, which has completely failed to arrest a single banker.
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:31.760]  Not a single one has been arrested, convicted of malfeasance on a gigantic scale.
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:38.520]  But of course there's a big, big set of issues, housing, the housing crisis, crisis of poverty
[01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:39.520]  amongst children.
[01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:43.640]  The people crammed like sardines onto baking ovens.
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:47.120]  Okay, so he starts to get into some of the local issues there and things that they could
[01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:51.800]  do if they weren't getting ripped off by the billions by these crooks there.
[01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:55.640]  Understand that in the city of London, it's about a square mile or whatever, it's where
[01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:57.600]  the big financial offices are.
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:59.000]  They've got their own special police force.
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.200]  It's kind of a separate jurisdiction there, just like the Vatican.
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:04.720]  Just like the Vatican has its own separate police force.
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:06.880]  So good luck to him.
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:08.840]  I'd like to see them shake that up.
[01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:10.080]  I thought it was pretty cool.
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:11.840]  He said a lot of people have their czars.
[01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:15.000]  I've got my Kaiser, Max Kaiser.
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.360]  It's an interesting idea.
[01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:22.480]  I'd like to talk to Max sometime about blockchain and exactly how that works, how that would
[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:29.000]  bring transparency and still keep things somewhat anonymous, how it could be used in monitoring
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.000]  voting, for example.
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.520]  A lot of people are talking about that.
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:34.880]  There's been a slew of articles this last week on that.
[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:42.120]  Now, of course, this last few days, Obama has been going through Africa.
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:45.320]  Remember when Bilderberg said a couple of years ago that they had a special focus on
[01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:46.320]  Africa?
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:49.520]  I mean, this is part, in my opinion, of neocolonialism.
[01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:55.760]  They're basically sizing the place up, seeing who they can get on their side, who they can
[01:18:55.760 --> 01:19:02.360]  subvert, and which countries they can go into to confiscate their minerals.
[01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:04.560]  This is neocolonialism, in my opinion.
[01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:08.000]  But of course, it's a tour that Obama is taking.
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.680]  He went into Kenya and pulled this clip up, guys.
[01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:14.640]  I want to play this clip where he goes in and he lectures the Kenyan president on gay
[01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:18.680]  rights, but this Kenyan president isn't having any of it.
[01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:22.080]  He kind of puts Obama in his place, and I think it's time we do that.
[01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:26.360]  There was an outrageous article that came up yesterday.
[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:33.880]  It was on the Daily Caller, Rob Dews was talking about it in the quick one-minute reports that
[01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:42.040]  we have about an anti-bullying conference that essentially became an LBGT recruitment.
[01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:46.920]  And at middle school kids is absolutely outrageous what they did.
[01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:51.240]  And of course, we had bullying when I was in school, but it wasn't bullying from the
[01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:53.360]  LBGT crowd.
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:56.480]  That's what we're going to talk about when we come back, how Obama was bullying the
[01:19:56.480 --> 01:20:01.040]  Kenyan president.
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:03.040]  We are a survival company.
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:07.400]  We manufacture our own line of level three in level three, a body armor.
[01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:11.280]  We proudly make our armor 100% in America.

[01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:01.840]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also
[01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:06.960]  enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:10.880]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:15.200]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans.
[01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:20.400]  We have now managed to secure the sought after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:26.720]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot blend 100% organic coffee at InfowarsLife.com.
[01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:31.240]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick me up for hours without the headaches and
[01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:33.960]  heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:38.280]  Once down, this is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections
[01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:40.920]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:45.680]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:48.680]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:53.600]  You will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of
[01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:57.800]  my favorite coffee available at InfowarsLife.com.
[01:21:57.800 --> 01:22:02.080]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia.
[01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:03.080]  It's true.
[01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:06.840]  The municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:09.320]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:14.000]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:20.960]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals,
[01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:26.880]  BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.
[01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:30.640]  Big Berkey water filters are the original and most trusted on the market.
[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:36.200]  The gold standard in water purification and our filters last for years at less than two

[01:23:53.560 --> 01:24:18.040]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on David Knight, your host will be joined later in
[01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:21.040]  the show by Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:28.200]  Here's another Mark Dice video where he's talking to liberals having them sign a petition
[01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:32.320]  to impose a 10% male privilege tax.
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:34.600]  That's up on the Drudge Report.
[01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:37.960]  Despite the fact he says that the gender pay gap is a complete myth.
[01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:43.480]  That's an article by Paul Joseph Watson and a video showing that petition from Mark Dice.
[01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:47.200]  We're going to talk about that with Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:49.880]  But of course that's part of the agenda.
[01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:57.360]  A huge part of the agenda of course is the agenda to sexualize our children, to change
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:58.360]  the family.
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:03.760]  And of course Obama took that agenda to Kenya and the Kenyan president was having none
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:04.760]  of it.
[01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:08.360]  Let's play that clip of what the Kenyan president said to Obama.
[01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:14.200]  Just like President Obama, I think we also need to be able to speak frankly about some
[01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:15.200]  of these things.
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:23.400]  The fact of the matter is that Kenya and the United States, we share so many values, our
[01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:32.200]  common love for democracy, entrepreneurship, value for families.
[01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:33.960]  These are things that we share.
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:38.320]  But there are some things that we must admit we don't share.
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:41.200]  Our culture, our societies don't accept.
[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:48.680]  It's very difficult for us to be able to impose on people that, which they themselves do
[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:50.760]  not accept.
[01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:57.920]  This is why I repeatedly say that for Kenyans today, the issue of gay rights is really an
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:25:58.920]  on-issue.
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:05.800]  We want to focus on other areas that are day-to-day living for our people, the health issues that
[01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:07.520]  we have discussed with President Obama.
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:15.440]  These are critical issues of ensuring inclusivity of women, a huge section of society that is
[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:20.240]  normally left out of the mainstream of economic development.
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:25.000]  What we can do in terms of infrastructure, what we can do in terms of education, in terms
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:30.000]  of our roads, in terms of giving our people power, encouraging entrepreneurship, these
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.640]  are the key focuses.
[01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:36.080]  Maybe once, like you have overcome some of these challenges, we can begin to look at
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:42.960]  new ones, but as of now, the fact remains that this issue is not really an issue that
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:47.160]  is on the foremost mind of Kenyans, and that is the fact.
[01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:51.520]  Yeah, it's not like we have solved all of those problems that he mentioned.
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:57.440]  Those are all things that are glaring problems, things that government could help, in most
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:26:59.440]  cases, by getting out of the way.
[01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:02.960]  Instead, what they're trying to do in the words of the Kenyan president that you just
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:07.520]  heard is impose on people what they do not accept, and of course, one of the ways that
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:11.740]  they do this primarily is through the schools.
[01:27:11.740 --> 01:27:14.720]  This is what the schools were designed for.
[01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:18.440]  If you go back and you look at the writings of Horace Mann and others, you'll see that
[01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:21.520]  that was what they wanted to create the schools for.
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:26.360]  They realized that their socialist experiments were not succeeding in the mid-1800s, and
[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:31.320]  they said, well, the problem is, is that we need to get to the children at an early age.
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:33.600]  Every dictator has said this throughout history.
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:38.120]  Going all the way back to Plato's Republic, where he basically wanted to destroy the family
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:41.880]  so that the only loyalty would be to the government.
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:43.880]  That would be the way they would control the people.
[01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:47.120]  They would not even know who their parents were.
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:49.600]  Perhaps we're pretty close to that today.
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:54.880]  When we send our children away to a government institution and have them spend most of their
[01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:58.280]  day there, do they really know who their parents are?
[01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:02.480]  Are they more connected to their peers than to their parents?
[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:07.400]  Do they see the school and the government as the authority figures rather than their
[01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:08.400]  parents?
[01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:09.400]  Ask yourself that.
[01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:12.000]  You need to think about that in your personal life.
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.320]  I know it's a difficult thing.
[01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:15.200]  We have such a high tax burden.
[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:20.640]  It has driven many people to have both parents, many families, both parents are working, even
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:22.200]  if you have a two-parent family.
[01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:24.520]  In many families, there's only one parent.
[01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:25.920]  It's extremely difficult.
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:31.480]  But I can tell you, if you can work with others, if you can find a way to take control of your
[01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:36.640]  children's education, to at least understand what is being taught to them, to know the
[01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:40.920]  teachers there, you can't put a price tag on that.
[01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:43.480]  That is going to pay dividends in your life.
[01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:48.440]  Quite frankly, that's the only way you and your children and your grandchildren and their
[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:50.280]  children are going to be free.
[01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:55.320]  Take a look at this story that was up on Infowars.com again, came out yesterday at an anti-bullying
[01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:56.320]  conference.
[01:28:56.320 --> 01:29:01.680]  Middle schoolers learn about lesbian sex from the people who are presenting it there.
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:08.320]  This is in a small town, only, well, it's less than 5,000 people, 4,690 people in a
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:10.040]  small Iowa town.
[01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:14.560]  Among the nearly two dozen speakers who are supposedly going to be there about bullying,
[01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:18.440]  only one attendee, only two addressed bullying said one attendee.
[01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:20.800]  The rest of them were selling this.
[01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:21.800]  That's why.
[01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:26.640]  That and other things, like Common Core, is why so many people are moving to homeschooling.
[01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:32.160]  It's an article from Common Watch talking about how in Virginia and other places people
[01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:36.520]  are concerned that even the private schools, even the Catholic schools are adopting Common
[01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:39.920]  Core because they want to teach to the test.
[01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:42.200]  Don't let them put that kind of pressure on you.
[01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:43.760]  Stay with us when we come back.
[01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:47.200]  We're going to have a replay of the Black Lives Matter.
[01:29:47.200 --> 01:29:49.040]  That's something that Salon said.
[01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:59.160]  The Empires on the Run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:03.640]  Last week, while on a campaign stop in Iowa, Donald Trump specifically mentioned the video
[01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:09.160]  Joe Biggs and Josh Owens shot showing illegal immigrants smuggling drugs into this country.
[01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:13.040]  And over the weekend, he retweeted a message from one of his campaign staffers with a direct
[01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:14.040]  link to the video.
[01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:19.040]  Actually, the camera crew or the reporters were petrified because they thought they're
[01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:21.960]  going to be killed because they're showing this on camera.
[01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:24.520]  The guys carrying bags of stuff, it was drugs.
[01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:28.400]  Both Trump and Bernie Sanders are rising in the polls as these two mavericks seem to be
[01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:29.920]  a threat to the establishment.
[01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:34.080]  But as Kurt Nimmel writes, the puppet masters behind the political facade have absolutely
[01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:36.520]  no fear of Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders.
[01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:40.680]  Both are part of a traveling sideshow on the road to the primaries in the November 2016
[01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:41.680]  presidential election.
[01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:46.040]  Bush or Clinton will sit in the White House come January 2017, and everything between
[01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:49.400]  now and then is little more than pure political theater.
[01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:51.080]  You can read more in the article.
[01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:56.200]  Forget Trump and Bernie, here's why Clinton or Bush will be the next president on Infowars.com.
[01:30:56.200 --> 01:30:58.200]  Rob Dew reporting.
[01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:02.160]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:07.240]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors
[01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:10.560]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:15.840]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies.

[01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:33.840]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionist and chemist

[01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:10.840]  zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic

[01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:15.960]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN
[01:33:15.960 --> 01:33:16.960]  radio network.
[01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:23.640]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight.
[01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:29.480]  It was less than a week ago that Salon came out with an article titled, conspiracy theorists
[01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:31.840]  have hijacked the GOP.
[01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:37.040]  What happens when Trump, Cruz and Carson start following Alex Jones' lead?
[01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:38.240]  What are they so upset about?
[01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:44.080]  Well, they say the GOP every day is continuing to follow the very fringes of political discourse
[01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:50.000]  sounding eerily similar to the paleoconservative conspiracy theorists like radio host Alex
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:55.640]  Jones and specifically they're talking about this rally that was held back in May, the
[01:33:55.640 --> 01:33:58.800]  rally that we went to in Austin.
[01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:04.560]  Taking the hashtag Black Lives Matter and pointing out the racist genocidal history
[01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:09.400]  of Planned Parenthood, a history that Salon spends the rest of the article trying to deny
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:10.400]  exists.
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:13.880]  Yes, Black Lives Matter, all lives matter.
[01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:20.120]  Planned Parenthood has focused primarily on Black lives and taking Black lives from the
[01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:21.120]  very beginning.
[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:36.240]  Here's that report again, just so Salon knows where we're coming from.
[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:47.080]  On this Monday, the 27th day of July, 2015, I want to look back a couple months ago to
[01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:55.160]  what happened on May 21st when myself, Jakari Jackson and others simply tried to go down
[01:34:55.160 --> 01:35:02.800]  to the Planned Parenthood here in Austin, Texas and point out that all Black lives matter.
[01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:08.560]  That was an idea that Reverend Childress in New Jersey had already had for months, had
[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:14.120]  already been doing with great success and that we weren't even aware of.
[01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:20.220]  McHale-Phalan had the similar idea, great minds think alike, necessities the mother
[01:35:20.220 --> 01:35:21.220]  of invention.
[01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:28.480]  If we're going to have race war over 100 or so innocent Black people that may get shot
[01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:30.400]  a year, that's a terrible number.
[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:34.880]  That's a high number too, but let's just say it's over 100, then shouldn't we worry about
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:41.560]  the millions of Blacks, it's over 18 million that have been killed since Roe v. Wade 42
[01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:46.800]  years ago in 1973, which is there to target Blacks.
[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:55.520]  So we go out there and these demons just show up of all races clad in Black to announce
[01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:59.720]  how they love Satan and love death and love dead babies.
[01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:05.280]  Now I've told you that years ago I was involved quite a bit and folks that watched me on Access
[01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:11.360]  TV 18, 19 years ago saw these reports that I would go out and demonstrate and also cover
[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:16.160]  others that were demonstrating at a mortuary just to draw attention to it.
[01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:19.960]  And not out of some goody two shoes angle or something, I understand you do humanized
[01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:26.520]  babies, then it's old people, then it's veterans, then it's everybody, euthanasia, kill grandma,
[01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:29.080]  the whole nine yards.
[01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:33.200]  And I'm not some hypocrite on a high horse here, I've had girlfriends in high school
[01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:37.400]  and college that had abortions and I repent for that.
[01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:43.320]  And not even from a religious perspective, I repent for devaluing human life.
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:48.940]  By the way, I wasn't for the abortions, but I didn't fight too hard to stop them.
[01:36:48.940 --> 01:36:50.760]  And my activity led to that happening.
[01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:52.600]  So let me just get that out there in the open.
[01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:54.320]  I'm not judging people that have had abortions.
[01:36:54.320 --> 01:37:00.840]  You were lied to, you were manipulated, just to understand, it's about eugenics, it's
[01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:03.640]  about lowering human life and something I've told people for years.
[01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:08.760]  China comes and grabs women, does a cesarean, waits till they're eight, nine months pregnant,
[01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:09.960]  keeps the baby alive.
[01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:12.640]  This is really secretive stuff, but it's leaked.
[01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:18.440]  And then kills the baby and then folks fly their kids into Japan, they fly the organs
[01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:25.640]  into Japan right after they're removed, sometimes in a mobile van, also prisoners as well.
[01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:31.080]  And then you get the quote, fresh organs is the Chinese translation from some of the brochures.
[01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:37.880]  Well Planned Parenthood here domestically is getting corneas, is getting livers, is
[01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:44.160]  getting lungs, heart, kidneys, you can get a hundred, two hundred grand per kidney, you
[01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:47.640]  can get 300 grand for a heart, 300 grand for a liver.
[01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:50.120]  And then these are put in people's sick children.
[01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:56.320]  But the point is, you pay 300 to 400 bucks for an abortion, maybe more for a partial birth.
[01:37:56.320 --> 01:38:03.600]  And here's this woman a few weeks ago famously the director of medical services for Planned
[01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:09.160]  Parenthood, a high level person that works for the Obama administration official as well.
[01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:12.760]  Just bragging, drinking wine, we get a lot of money for these baby parts and we don't
[01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:15.120]  want folks to know about that while she slurps wine.
[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:20.760]  And of course there's another angle to this, in a sick way and I'm not endorsing abortion,
[01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:25.200]  at least some life is coming out of the kids that are being killed and that their organs
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:27.160]  are being sold.
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:30.160]  But do you really want a baby to die so that you can live?
[01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:31.160]  Maybe you do.
[01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:36.640]  But regardless, folks having abortions need to know you should be being paid, not the
[01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:38.440]  other way around.
[01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:41.400]  But that's how these wicked operations operate.
[01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:44.480]  Of course you're getting screwed when you kill your baby.
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:51.200]  So think about it, think twice and, or for God's sakes, use contraception and don't get
[01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:52.200]  pregnant.
[01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:54.280]  Don't use abortion as birth control.
[01:38:54.280 --> 01:38:57.120]  I think that's what I'm trying to get at here.
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:39:01.000]  When I would go demonstrate against abortion clinics many years ago, people would walk
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:06.080]  up and say, I'm going to kill you, I love Satan, who wants these black people, we got
[01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:10.000]  to get rid of these weeds, Margaret Sanger of course said that on record.
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:15.120]  And then I just watch them as this paragon of liberal, lovey doveness and they're the
[01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:17.840]  best people in the world and they're so good.
[01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:26.400]  Just know that they're getting hundreds of thousands of dollars conservatively as the
[01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:29.680]  middleman shelling these organs.
[01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:34.000]  And she's talking about how to chop them up and keep the torso intact because you can't
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:38.240]  tell the woman, hey, we're doing a cesarean, don't look at this baby, we're going to take
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:42.360]  it over here to keep it, you know, to then harvest it properly because you got to cut
[01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:45.480]  the ventricles, you've got to, you know, cut the arteries of the heart, you've got to get
[01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:48.400]  the kidneys right so they're deliverable.
[01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:51.960]  So there, there they are trying because it'd be better for the woman to chop the baby up
[01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:54.880]  in small parts in the uterus.
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:58.760]  Once the baby's gotten larger, late second or third trimester, they're in there.
[01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:04.560]  I hate to talk about this, but it's just a fact, not even properly butchering the child
[01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:09.640]  with big old forceps ripping it out of you in an attempt to keep it intact to get those
[01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:10.640]  organs.
[01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:14.080]  And I mean, look, this could be a new business.
[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:17.680]  For these people that love Satan and death and all this, they're, they're paying for
[01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:21.280]  abortions to be part of the holy sacrament of Satan.
[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:23.280]  Why not get paid?
[01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:27.360]  And then women can just like a chicken farm or whatever, you know, instead of a chicken
[01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:31.320]  being tortured a little cage, you just, you know, have the baby right there and then you
[01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:35.840]  go in and you can get bids on who's going to pay the most for your baby parts, for your
[01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:37.120]  blood type and stuff.
[01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:39.760]  So it's a new business opportunity and I'm not being cynical here.
[01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:40.960]  This is not dark satire.
[01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:41.960]  I'm serious.
[01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:48.000]  You Satanist are going to get greedy, I believe once you realize this is going on and want
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:51.640]  the money that you can get, so you're going to try to go find women you can get to get
[01:40:51.640 --> 01:40:56.760]  pregnant as Satanists do to then, you know, obviously have children to be sacrificed.
[01:40:56.760 --> 01:40:58.640]  That's what real Satanists do.
[01:40:58.640 --> 01:41:03.480]  And they're going to go out and, you know, basically start demanding in the market that
[01:41:03.480 --> 01:41:08.000]  you get hundreds of thousands of your fair share of the organ money and that that might
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:13.320]  actually bring out the fact that this is really a macabre exercise and evil.
[01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:19.280]  I think these little want to be communist kids are just trying to be shocking and are
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:22.880]  attracted to evil like a moth is to flame.
[01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:27.560]  But the higher ups at Planned Parenthood and others are truly demonic and evil.
[01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:32.320]  So that's the bottom line or even harvesting, trafficking, and you notice no mainstream
[01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:38.700]  media has covered this other than to whitewash it and to say it's isolated and no big deal.
[01:41:38.700 --> 01:41:44.000]  So here is that report on this Monday Transmission, then we're going to David Knight, Alex Jones
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  assaulted by a rabid communist here it is.
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:42.880]  Why are you so worried about a zygote and ultimately
[01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:43.880]  your sympathies?
[01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:44.880]  Do not lie with black people.
[01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:48.360]  They lie with your racist white middle class agenda and that's where we'll always lie and
[01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:50.360]  you will be destroyed holding that line.
[01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:51.360]  Okay.
[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:52.360]  I adopted two children.
[01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:53.360]  Oh, good for you.
[01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:54.360]  White savior.
[01:42:54.360 --> 01:42:55.360]  Aren't you so proud?
[01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:56.360]  You're not white.
[01:42:56.360 --> 01:42:57.360]  Exactly.
[01:42:57.360 --> 01:42:58.360]  He's not white.
[01:42:58.360 --> 01:42:59.360]  Exactly.
[01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:00.360]  You're a white savior.
[01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:05.360]  You think that it is the white man's duty to fix everybody's problems, right?
[01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:06.360]  How many did you adopt?
[01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:07.360]  How many did I adopt?
[01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:08.360]  I kill my kids.
[01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:09.360]  How many?
[01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:10.360]  How many did I adopt?
[01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:13.360]  How many did I adopt?
[01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:16.360]  I kill my kids.
[01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:18.360]  I kill my kids.
[01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:19.360]  I pay for that.
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:21.360]  I pay all my money for that.
[01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:24.360]  I get free abortions on demand without apology.
[01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:25.360]  Yep.
[01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:27.360]  And I'm going to hell.
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:29.360]  Yeah, I still pay to kill babies though.
[01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:30.360]  Really?
[01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:31.360]  Oh, yeah.
[01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:33.360]  How do you get your abortions paid for?
[01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:34.360]  I pay for them.
[01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:35.360]  I thought you said free.
[01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:36.360]  I pay for them.
[01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:37.360]  Upwards of 50.
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:38.360]  Really?
[01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:39.360]  Oh, yeah.
[01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:40.360]  Wow.
[01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:43.360]  I raise money from the community board.
[01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:45.360]  Oh, you don't use your money?
[01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:47.360]  You multiply your efforts, huh?
[01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:51.360]  Well, we're down here pointing out that all black lives matter, all lives matter, and
[01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:57.360]  that the very people who want to literally wipe out black Americans through Planned Parenthood
[01:43:57.360 --> 01:44:02.360]  on record are the ones trying to create this whole race war and garbage off some of these
[01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:03.360]  tragedies.
[01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:06.360]  We're pointing out the real organized genocide with the documented proof.
[01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:08.360]  We're talking a lot of great folks.
[01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:09.360]  Give us your take on all this.
[01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:14.360]  Yeah, I think that we're going to continue forward as a country and we need to...
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:15.360]  Fight us!
[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:16.360]  Excuse us!
[01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:17.360]  Fight us!
[01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:18.360]  Excuse us!
[01:44:18.360 --> 01:44:19.360]  Fight us!
[01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:20.360]  Excuse us!
[01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:21.360]  Chill, chill, chill.
[01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:22.360]  Chill, chill, chill.
[01:44:22.360 --> 01:44:23.360]  Chill, chill, chill.
[01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:24.360]  Chill, chill, chill.
[01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:25.360]  All right.
[01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:26.360]  We're just assaulted.
[01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:27.360]  Get the cops.
[01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:28.360]  Get the cops.
[01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:29.360]  That guy's got the witness.
[01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:30.360]  He's coming at me again.
[01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:31.360]  Right now.
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:39.040]  Which one do we do, bro?
[01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:44.040]  Go ahead.
[01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:45.640]  Move away from the street, man.
[01:44:45.640 --> 01:44:46.640]  You're going to get hurt.
[01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:47.640]  Move away from the street.
[01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:48.640]  Bro, you've got to chill, bro.
[01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:49.640]  Get the cops.
[01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:50.640]  Get the cops.
[01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:51.640]  Get the cops.
[01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:52.640]  You're going into second lane.
[01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:53.640]  Get the cops.
[01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:54.640]  Get the cops.
[01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:55.640]  Get the cops.
[01:44:55.640 --> 01:44:56.640]  Get the cops.
[01:44:56.640 --> 01:44:57.640]  Get the cops.
[01:44:57.640 --> 01:44:58.640]  Get the cops.
[01:44:58.640 --> 01:44:59.640]  Get the cops.
[01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:00.640]  Get the cops.
[01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:02.640]  Get out of here!
[01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:04.640]  Get the hell out of here!
[01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:06.640]  You're God's falling!
[01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:08.640]  Hey, we had you guys on video.
[01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:10.640]  You're God's falling!
[01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:12.640]  You're weak! You're God's weak!
[01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:14.640]  Come on!
[01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:16.640]  Look at these clouds!
[01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:18.640]  Look at these clouds!
[01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:20.640]  Look at these clouds!
[01:45:20.640 --> 01:45:22.640]  Hey!
[01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:24.640]  Hey, don't beat them up!
[01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:26.640]  Look at these clouds!
[01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:28.640]  Hey, don't beat them up!
[01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:48.640]  Yeah, we're trying to get these guys out of their parking lot.
[01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:50.640]  Yeah, you guys got a lot of feet.
[01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:52.640]  We're trying to get out of your parking lot.
[01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:54.640]  Hey, brother, we just got to solve them.
[01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:56.640]  We're just getting out of here.
[01:45:56.640 --> 01:45:58.640]  Alright, here we go.
[01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:00.640]  People ask me why I'm a Christian.
[01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:02.640]  I don't mean these fake churches.
[01:46:02.640 --> 01:46:04.640]  I face the New World Order over and over again.
[01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:06.640]  They're all devil worshipers!
[01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:08.640]  We know who they are, and we're sick of them!
[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:10.640]  You've been ousted!
[01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:12.640]  We're sick of you hurting children, you filth!
[01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:14.640]  We see you!
[01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:16.640]  We see you, and humanity's rising.
[01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:18.640]  You start, and him pick us, and tell us to submit.
[01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:20.640]  We'll never submit to you, and humanity's rising!
[01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:24.640]  She was the founder of the American Birth Control League,
[01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:26.640]  and the publisher of its newsletter,
[01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:28.640]  The Birth Control Review.
[01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:30.640]  On a practical level,
[01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:32.640]  the relationship between Sanger and these elitists
[01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:36.640]  was basically a marriage of convenience.
[01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:38.640]  The result was that the American Birth Control League
[01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:40.640]  became the driving force
[01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:42.640]  behind the American eugenics movement.
[01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:46.640]  Eugenics would no longer just be a philosophy.
[01:46:46.640 --> 01:46:48.640]  Sanger and others like her
[01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:50.640]  were going to put it into practice.
[01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:52.640]  We are paying for,
[01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:54.640]  and even submitting to, the dictates
[01:46:54.640 --> 01:46:56.640]  of an ever-increasing, unceasingly
[01:46:56.640 --> 01:46:58.640]  spawning class of human beings
[01:46:58.640 --> 01:47:00.640]  who never should have been born at all.
[01:47:00.640 --> 01:47:04.640]  Margaret Sanger, 1922.
[01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:06.640]  I have a partner!
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:08.640]  Don't hurt children!
[01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:10.640]  I f***ing love Satan!
[01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:12.640]  Say that again. Who do you love?
[01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:14.640]  I f***ing love Satan, so f*** you!
[01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:16.640]  And you're not stalling supporters?
[01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:18.640]  I can't! No, I'm not!
[01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:20.640]  I'm a f***ing anarchist, sir!
[01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:22.640]  Hold on, so there's not a Facebook
[01:47:22.640 --> 01:47:24.640]  with you saying you love stalling?
[01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:26.640]  Off of me!
[01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:28.640]  Go away!
[01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:30.640]  Go away!
[01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:32.640]  How many did I adopt?
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:34.640]  I kill my kids!
[01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:36.640]  Ultimately, your sympathies do not lie with black people.
[01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:38.640]  They lie with your racist white middle-class agenda,
[01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:40.640]  and that's where we'll always lie,
[01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:42.640]  and you will be destroyed holding that line.
[01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:44.640]  We need to respect capitalism
[01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:46.640]  and peace.
[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:48.640]  You own that label!
[01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:50.640]  You are a misogynist!
[01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:52.640]  You are a misogynist!
[01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:54.640]  Wait a minute, you marching a black lives matter thing
[01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:56.640]  with a hammer and a circle?
[01:47:56.640 --> 01:47:58.640]  Is that you?
[01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:00.640]  What are you talking about?
[01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:02.640]  Are you talking about what you're doing right now?
[01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:04.640]  We're just asking you, that's your Facebook.
[01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:06.640]  That's really impressive, the alien thing to you.
[01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:08.640]  That's really impressive.
[01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:10.640]  Hey man, you're something else.
[01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:12.640]  Those are people I've never met an alien before.
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:14.640]  What do you like? Which planet?
[01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:16.640]  What do they sound like?
[01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:18.640]  It's a Freddy's series.
[01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:20.640]  Anyways, do you have any language skills other than cuss words?
[01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:22.640]  Cuss words?
[01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:24.640]  Cuss words?
[01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:26.640]  Cuss words?
[01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:28.640]  Cuss words?
[01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:30.640]  No, more pathetic than gollum.
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:32.640]  More pathetic than gollum.
[01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:34.640]  You don't want to talk?
[01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:36.640]  Not to you.
[01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:38.640]  I don't want to talk to you.
[01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:40.640]  Why the f*** would I want to talk to you?
[01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:42.640]  You got here and you sure made fools of yourself,
[01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:44.640]  so thank you.
[01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:46.640]  And again, that was the Marxist
[01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:48.640]  that the Planned Parenthood counter-demonstrating
[01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:50.640]  as we try to point out
[01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:52.640]  that all lives matter,
[01:48:52.640 --> 01:48:54.640]  especially black lives that Margaret Sanger
[01:48:54.640 --> 01:48:56.640]  and her organization specifically targeted.
[01:48:56.640 --> 01:48:58.640]  We're going to have Abby Johnson,
[01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:00.640]  who was a Planned Parenthood employee
[01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:02.640]  of the year back in 2009 just before she quit.
[01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:04.640]  Why did she quit and become a whistleblower?
[01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:06.640]  She saw an ultrasound
[01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:08.640]  procedure against a baby.
[01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:10.640]  She was told,
[01:49:10.640 --> 01:49:12.640]  oh, at this stage they can't feel any pain,
[01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:14.640]  and yet she saw this baby withdrawing
[01:49:14.640 --> 01:49:16.640]  in pain.
[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:18.640]  We're going to talk to her about her experiences
[01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:20.640]  with Planned Parenthood.
[01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:22.640]  We're also going to talk to her about
[01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:24.640]  the recent revelations
[01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:26.640]  about the selling of baby body parts.
[01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:28.640]  She's going to be in studio with us tomorrow.
[01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:30.640]  If you want to know,
[01:49:30.640 --> 01:49:32.640]  if you want to learn about this
[01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:34.640]  racist eugenesis
[01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:36.640]  depopulation agenda, great way to do it
[01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:38.640]  is to become a Prison Planet TV subscriber.
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:40.640]  Your subscription
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:42.640]  at $5.95 a month
[01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:44.640]  or at a discount $54.95
[01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:46.640]  for a year gives you access
[01:49:46.640 --> 01:49:48.640]  to the nightly news. Each night as it happens
[01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:50.640]  you have full access to all the archives,
[01:49:50.640 --> 01:49:52.640]  the radio program, as well as
[01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:54.640]  all of Alex Jones' documentaries.
[01:49:54.640 --> 01:49:56.640]  That works out, if you get an annual membership
[01:49:56.640 --> 01:49:58.640]  that works out to just $0.15 a day.
[01:49:58.640 --> 01:50:00.640]  It hardly supports our bandwidth,
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:02.640]  but it is a great way
[01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:04.640]  to support us to get that information
[01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:06.640]  out there. We make it available because
[01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:08.640]  we want you to use that information.
[01:50:08.640 --> 01:50:10.640]  The documentaries and other things to wake people up.
[01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:12.640]  You can share that with 20 people
[01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:14.640]  each night. You can all watch the nightly news.
[01:50:14.640 --> 01:50:16.640]  You can have access to Alex Jones'
[01:50:16.640 --> 01:50:18.640]  documentaries. And before we go to break
[01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:20.640]  I just want to let you know again about
[01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:22.640]  the Propure Filter that just has four days
[01:50:22.640 --> 01:50:24.640]  left on it. Again, that's the
[01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:26.640]  Propure Water Filter that filters fluoride
[01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:28.640]  for 20% off until the end of June
[01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:30.640]  while supplies last.
[01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:32.640]  That's the portable filter. You can see that
[01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:34.640]  at infowarsstore.com.
[01:50:34.640 --> 01:50:36.640]  When we come back
[01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:38.640]  we're going to take another look at
[01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:40.640]  the immigration issue. New California
[01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:42.640]  mass immigration
[01:50:42.640 --> 01:50:44.640]  is turning Virginia blue.
[01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:46.640]  We're going to talk about where those people
[01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:48.640]  are coming from. You might be surprised.
[01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:50.640]  Most of them are not coming from Mexico.
[01:50:50.640 --> 01:51:02.640]  We'll be right back.
[01:51:20.640 --> 01:51:22.640]  This is Dan Pilla. Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:51:22.640 --> 01:51:24.640]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:26.640]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:51:26.640 --> 01:51:28.640]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:30.640]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement
[01:51:30.640 --> 01:51:32.640]  and I'm telling you, there's no such thing
[01:51:32.640 --> 01:51:34.640]  as a hopeless case. Call 834
[01:51:34.640 --> 01:51:36.640]  no tax to finally get free
[01:51:36.640 --> 01:51:38.640]  of IRS debt. With the IRS's new programs
[01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:40.640]  there's never been a better time to
[01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:42.640]  sell it.
[01:51:42.640 --> 01:51:44.640]  There's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:46.640]  Call 834 no tax
[01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:48.640]  to finally get free of IRS debt.
[01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:50.640]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been
[01:51:50.640 --> 01:51:52.640]  a better time to solve your problem.
[01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:54.640]  Call 834 no tax
[01:51:54.640 --> 01:51:56.640]  that's 834 no tax on my website
[01:51:56.640 --> 01:51:58.640]  danpilla.com
[01:51:58.640 --> 01:52:00.640]  As if chlorine in our water
[01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:02.640]  weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:52:02.640 --> 01:52:04.640]  It's true. Some municipalities
[01:52:04.640 --> 01:52:06.640]  are now adding ammonia plus chlorine
[01:52:06.640 --> 01:52:08.640]  to your water supply. It's a disinfectant
[01:52:08.640 --> 01:52:10.640]  called chloramine.
[01:52:10.640 --> 01:52:12.640]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter
[01:52:12.640 --> 01:52:14.640]  you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[01:52:14.640 --> 01:52:16.640]  New NSF
[01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:18.640]  EPA certified lab tests show
[01:52:18.640 --> 01:52:20.640]  EPA Berkey water filters remove
[01:52:20.640 --> 01:52:22.640]  chloramines, pharmaceuticals,
[01:52:22.640 --> 01:52:24.640]  BPA, pesticides, bacteria
[01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:26.640]  and viruses, all forms of fluoride
[01:52:26.640 --> 01:52:28.640]  and much more. Big Berkey
[01:52:28.640 --> 01:52:30.640]  water filters are the original and most
[01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:32.640]  trusted on the market. The gold
[01:52:32.640 --> 01:52:34.640]  standard in water purification
[01:52:34.640 --> 01:52:36.640]  and our filters last for years
[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:38.640]  at less than two cents per gallon.
[01:52:38.640 --> 01:52:40.640]  Big Berkey, the one that's
[01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:42.640]  powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.
[01:52:42.640 --> 01:52:44.640]  Get your Big Berkey
[01:52:44.640 --> 01:52:46.640]  today. Call 1-877-99-BERKE

[01:52:50.640 --> 01:52:52.640]  That's 1-877-99-B-E-R-K-E-Y
[01:52:52.640 --> 01:52:54.640]  Big Berkey water filters
[01:52:54.640 --> 01:52:56.640]  for the love of clean
[01:52:56.640 --> 01:52:58.640]  water.
[01:52:58.640 --> 01:53:00.640]  On the average, Americans work between
[01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:02.640]  45 to 50 years hoping to build up
[01:53:02.640 --> 01:53:04.640]  enough wealth to retire and live out their
[01:53:04.640 --> 01:53:06.640]  golden years. Unfortunately, with
[01:53:06.640 --> 01:53:08.640]  taxation, the rising cost of food,
[01:53:08.640 --> 01:53:10.640]  energy, housing and medical,
[01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:12.640]  many retirees are forced to live below
[01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:14.640]  poverty line. Is this a flaw for
[01:53:14.640 --> 01:53:16.640]  enterprise or is our monetary unit
[01:53:16.640 --> 01:53:18.640]  we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us
[01:53:18.640 --> 01:53:20.640]  into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation
[01:53:20.640 --> 01:53:22.640]  and higher taxes? These questions
[01:53:22.640 --> 01:53:24.640]  and more can be answered by reading
[01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:26.640]  G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from
[01:53:26.640 --> 01:53:28.640]  Jekyll Island. Congressman Ron Paul states
[01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:30.640]  it's what every American needs to know about
[01:53:30.640 --> 01:53:32.640]  central bank power. A gripping
[01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:34.640]  adventure into the secret world of
[01:53:34.640 --> 01:53:36.640]  international banking cartel.
[01:53:36.640 --> 01:53:38.640]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. I will give a silver
[01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:40.640]  dollar from the early 1900s to anyone
[01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:42.640]  who purchases this book. Call
[01:53:42.640 --> 01:53:44.640]  1-800-686-2237
[01:53:44.640 --> 01:53:46.640]  and order a copy today.
[01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:48.640]  It's critical that the public be made aware
[01:53:48.640 --> 01:53:50.640]  of the system. Call and order your copy
[01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:52.640]  today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:53:52.640 --> 01:53:54.640]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:54:06.640 --> 01:54:08.640]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm
[01:54:08.640 --> 01:54:10.640]  David Knight. We're going to be joined
[01:54:10.640 --> 01:54:12.640]  in the next hour by Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:54:12.640 --> 01:54:14.640]  We're going to be talking about this Mark
[01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:16.640]  Dice man on the street as well as
[01:54:16.640 --> 01:54:18.640]  the whole issue underlying
[01:54:18.640 --> 01:54:20.640]  and he talks to people. Ask them if
[01:54:20.640 --> 01:54:22.640]  they'll sign a petition to impose
[01:54:22.640 --> 01:54:24.640]  a 10% tax
[01:54:24.640 --> 01:54:26.640]  for male privilege.
[01:54:26.640 --> 01:54:28.640]  Another one of these reports
[01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:30.640]  and of course it's California.
[01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:32.640]  You can find plenty of people to do
[01:54:32.640 --> 01:54:34.640]  things like that. Before we do
[01:54:34.640 --> 01:54:36.640]  I just want to, I saw this article
[01:54:36.640 --> 01:54:38.640]  today.
[01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:40.640]  New California.
[01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:42.640]  Mass immigration turning Virginia blue.
[01:54:42.640 --> 01:54:44.640]  This is off the drudge report.
[01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:46.640]  You need to understand
[01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:48.640]  where the open borders are coming from.
[01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:50.640]  I mean there's a lot of different components to it.
[01:54:50.640 --> 01:54:52.640]  One of them of course is the fact that
[01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:54.640]  politicians, Democrat and Republican
[01:54:54.640 --> 01:54:56.640]  realize that we have a North American
[01:54:56.640 --> 01:54:58.640]  union as Pelosi pointed out.
[01:54:58.640 --> 01:55:00.640]  It's just we have
[01:55:00.640 --> 01:55:02.640]  one group of people here.
[01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:04.640]  It just happens to have one community.
[01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:06.640]  They have a border running through it.
[01:55:06.640 --> 01:55:08.640]  We had Petraeus point out
[01:55:08.640 --> 01:55:10.640]  that what comes after America
[01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:12.640]  North America
[01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:14.640]  specifically ties it to
[01:55:14.640 --> 01:55:16.640]  NAFTA.
[01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:18.640]  Which essentially created the North American union.
[01:55:18.640 --> 01:55:20.640]  It's going to become more consolidated for sure.
[01:55:20.640 --> 01:55:22.640]  Just as a European union is becoming
[01:55:22.640 --> 01:55:24.640]  more consolidated. They're using the economic crisis.
[01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:26.640]  First they create an economic trading
[01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:28.640]  group. Then they create an economic crisis.
[01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:30.640]  Then they use that crisis as a
[01:55:30.640 --> 01:55:32.640]  means to seize political control.
[01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:34.640]  We can already see this happening
[01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:36.640]  throughout Europe. That's why Alex Jones
[01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:38.640]  is going through Europe. He's going to be filing reports
[01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:40.640]  about
[01:55:40.640 --> 01:55:42.640]  what is going on in Europe, the globalization plan.
[01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:44.640]  But when we come back to this article
[01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:46.640]  about how Virginia
[01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:48.640]  is turning into California, you need to understand
[01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:50.640]  that this is weaponized
[01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:52.640]  politicized immigration.
[01:55:52.640 --> 01:55:54.640]  This is not about
[01:55:54.640 --> 01:55:56.640]  ethnicity. It's not about
[01:55:56.640 --> 01:55:58.640]  nation of origin. That's why
[01:55:58.640 --> 01:56:00.640]  I don't like the way that Donald Trump has pointed out.
[01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:02.640]  He has
[01:56:02.640 --> 01:56:04.640]  hit a responding note
[01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:06.640]  with people because he has talked about
[01:56:06.640 --> 01:56:08.640]  what all of us realize is a problem.
[01:56:08.640 --> 01:56:10.640]  Just the sheer magnitude of people
[01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:12.640]  coming in. Regardless of where they're
[01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:14.640]  coming from. Regardless even
[01:56:14.640 --> 01:56:16.640]  whether they're legal or illegal.
[01:56:16.640 --> 01:56:18.640]  The massive
[01:56:18.640 --> 01:56:20.640]  exporting of jobs at the same time that
[01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:22.640]  we bring in massive amounts of labor.
[01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:24.640]  It's going to increase unemployment.
[01:56:24.640 --> 01:56:26.640]  It's going to decrease our wages here.
[01:56:26.640 --> 01:56:28.640]  You can see it for example in Disney.
[01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:30.640]  The people that they brought in to replace their workers
[01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:32.640]  they brought them in from India.
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:34.640]  They told them train your replacements
[01:56:34.640 --> 01:56:36.640]  and then you're fired. Get out of here.
[01:56:36.640 --> 01:56:38.640]  Okay.
[01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:40.640]  That was a visa program that was sold to people
[01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:42.640]  saying we need to bring in people who are
[01:56:42.640 --> 01:56:44.640]  technically
[01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:46.640]  in a technical
[01:56:46.640 --> 01:56:48.640]  esoteric area.
[01:56:48.640 --> 01:56:50.640]  Jobs that we can't fill here in America.
[01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:52.640]  Silicon Valley needs to bring in
[01:56:52.640 --> 01:56:54.640]  engineers and scientists who have
[01:56:54.640 --> 01:56:56.640]  a very narrow specialty.
[01:56:56.640 --> 01:56:58.640]  It's not the way it's being used by Disney.
[01:56:58.640 --> 01:57:00.640]  We see that everywhere. But look at this article
[01:57:00.640 --> 01:57:02.640]  about what's going on in Virginia. They say
[01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:04.640]  3 out of 4 Virginia immigrants, 77%
[01:57:04.640 --> 01:57:06.640]  are coming from either Latin America
[01:57:06.640 --> 01:57:08.640]  or Asia.
[01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:10.640]  They say according to DHS
[01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:12.640]  refugees issued admission slips
[01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:14.640]  in the United States of those 75%
[01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:16.640]  came from 4 countries.
[01:57:16.640 --> 01:57:18.640]  Iraq, Burma, Somalia,
[01:57:18.640 --> 01:57:20.640]  Bhutan. Another 15%
[01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:22.640]  came from Iran, Sudan,
[01:57:22.640 --> 01:57:24.640]  Ethiopia, Eritrea, the Dominican Republic.
[01:57:24.640 --> 01:57:26.640]  We understand the borders are open.
[01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:28.640]  The policy is to bring in as many
[01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:30.640]  people as they can from all
[01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:32.640]  over the world because unlike any
[01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:34.640]  other country, we are going to
[01:57:34.640 --> 01:57:36.640]  make everything
[01:57:36.640 --> 01:57:38.640]  in the welfare state available to everyone.
[01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:40.640]  We're going to treat our immigrants
[01:57:40.640 --> 01:57:42.640]  legal and illegal better
[01:57:42.640 --> 01:57:44.640]  than we do our American citizens.
[01:57:44.640 --> 01:57:46.640]  We're going to give them diplomatic immunity
[01:57:46.640 --> 01:57:48.640]  when they commit crimes. We're going to do a
[01:57:48.640 --> 01:57:50.640]  catch and release. We're not going to export them.
[01:57:50.640 --> 01:57:52.640]  If we do deport them,
[01:57:52.640 --> 01:57:54.640]  we can come right back in and do that again.
[01:57:54.640 --> 01:57:56.640]  That's the thing
[01:57:56.640 --> 01:57:58.640]  that concerns Americans. It's no longer
[01:57:58.640 --> 01:58:00.640]  a melting pot where people come to
[01:58:00.640 --> 01:58:02.640]  America on their own volition because
[01:58:02.640 --> 01:58:04.640]  they want to be freer.
[01:58:04.640 --> 01:58:06.640]  No, we are
[01:58:06.640 --> 01:58:08.640]  attracting people. We are drawing people
[01:58:08.640 --> 01:58:10.640]  in because they want
[01:58:10.640 --> 01:58:12.640]  to get a
[01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:14.640]  welfare check in many cases.
[01:58:14.640 --> 01:58:16.640]  They're also coming in because
[01:58:16.640 --> 01:58:18.640]  the criminals are coming in because of the drugs.
[01:58:18.640 --> 01:58:20.640]  You know that giant sucking sound that
[01:58:20.640 --> 01:58:22.640]  we talked about? Maybe that's people
[01:58:22.640 --> 01:58:24.640]  in America snorting
[01:58:24.640 --> 01:58:26.640]  cocaine. Maybe it's the war on drugs
[01:58:26.640 --> 01:58:28.640]  that's bringing the kind of violent crime
[01:58:28.640 --> 01:58:30.640]  that people are fleeing in
[01:58:30.640 --> 01:58:32.640]  Central and South America. It's going to import
[01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:34.640]  that into America. We have to
[01:58:34.640 --> 01:58:36.640]  look at the causes of this
[01:58:36.640 --> 01:58:38.640]  and not just the consequences. Stay with us.
[01:58:38.640 --> 01:58:50.640]  We'll be right back.
[01:59:08.640 --> 01:59:10.640]  When cells become toxic, they die
[01:59:10.640 --> 01:59:12.640]  early and aging sets in.
[01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:14.640]  No one has put together a formula
[01:59:14.640 --> 01:59:16.640]  that focuses directly on brain health,
[01:59:16.640 --> 01:59:18.640]  nerve growth factors, and optimizing
[01:59:18.640 --> 01:59:20.640]  your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:59:20.640 --> 01:59:22.640]  Just one of the key compounds,
[01:59:22.640 --> 01:59:24.640]  biopqq, is backed by major
[01:59:24.640 --> 01:59:26.640]  clinical studies. You want the best
[01:59:26.640 --> 01:59:28.640]  that's out there at the lowest price
[01:59:28.640 --> 01:59:30.640]  anywhere? We now have.
[01:59:30.640 --> 01:59:32.640]  Biopqq.
[01:59:32.640 --> 01:59:34.640]  Biopqq.
[01:59:34.640 --> 01:59:36.640]  Biopqq.
[01:59:36.640 --> 01:59:38.640]  Biopqq.
[01:59:38.640 --> 01:59:40.640]  Biopqq.
[01:59:40.640 --> 01:59:42.640]  Biopqq.
[01:59:42.640 --> 01:59:44.640]  Biopqq.
[01:59:44.640 --> 01:59:48.640]  Biopqq.
[01:59:48.640 --> 01:59:50.640]  Biopqq.
[01:59:50.640 --> 01:59:52.640]  Biopqq.
[01:59:52.640 --> 01:59:54.640]  Biopqq.
[01:59:54.640 --> 01:59:56.640]  Biopqq.
[01:59:56.640 --> 01:59:58.640]  Biopqq.
[01:59:58.640 --> 02:00:00.640]  Biopqq.
[02:00:00.640 --> 02:00:04.640]  Bioprtobe.
[02:00:04.640 --> 02:00:09.520]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:11.120]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.120 --> 02:00:12.640]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.640 --> 02:00:16.800]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:20.720]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.680 --> 02:00:27.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:28.400]  I'm David Nye, and I want to pick up
[02:00:28.400 --> 02:00:29.920]  what we left off just before the break.
[02:00:29.920 --> 02:00:33.160]  We were talking about how Virginia is becoming
[02:00:33.160 --> 02:00:34.520]  the new California.
[02:00:34.520 --> 02:00:37.080]  Immigrants are turning the area blue.
[02:00:37.080 --> 02:00:40.400]  And so many of you ask, many of you who voted for the GOP ask,
[02:00:40.400 --> 02:00:43.400]  well, why won't the GOP oppose open borders?
[02:00:43.400 --> 02:00:48.520]  That's why Trump is soaring, is because he opposes that.
[02:00:48.520 --> 02:00:50.040]  That's what people thought they were voting for when
[02:00:50.040 --> 02:00:52.720]  they voted for Republicans in the Senate and the House.
[02:00:52.720 --> 02:00:53.640]  They're not getting that.
[02:00:53.640 --> 02:00:55.640]  Why aren't the Republicans doing that?
[02:00:55.640 --> 02:00:57.840]  It's going to be the extinction of the Republican Party,
[02:00:57.840 --> 02:01:00.520]  many people say, but they could care less, couldn't they?
[02:01:00.520 --> 02:01:01.440]  Why?
[02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:04.040]  Because it's simply a brand.
[02:01:04.040 --> 02:01:06.120]  The Republicans, especially at the top,
[02:01:06.120 --> 02:01:08.200]  don't stand for anything.
[02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:12.480]  It's like being a Dallas Cowboy or a Miami Dolphin.
[02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:14.000]  The players don't care.
[02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:15.880]  They just want to get the money.
[02:01:15.880 --> 02:01:18.880]  That's what the congressmen are all about.
[02:01:18.880 --> 02:01:21.040]  They could care less, which team they're on.
[02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:25.480]  The teams exist only to get you interested in the game,
[02:01:25.480 --> 02:01:29.120]  just like they create these interesting NFL teams,
[02:01:29.120 --> 02:01:31.720]  make them territorial so people can root for their city,
[02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:36.880]  so they can root for a Dallas Cowboy or a Miami Dolphin.
[02:01:36.880 --> 02:01:38.480]  We've got our donkeys and our elephants.
[02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:40.880]  People get so excited about all of that.
[02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:43.200]  It's just to get you involved in the game.
[02:01:43.200 --> 02:01:44.360]  They could care less.
[02:01:44.360 --> 02:01:47.640]  From the GOP side, they're pushing this for the US Chamber
[02:01:47.640 --> 02:01:51.360]  of Commerce because they want to lower wages.
[02:01:51.360 --> 02:01:53.720]  They want to be able to export jobs.
[02:01:53.720 --> 02:01:56.880]  And that's precisely what we're getting.
[02:01:56.880 --> 02:01:58.640]  But of course, Trump is talking about it now,
[02:01:58.640 --> 02:02:02.960]  Sheriff Joe is telling Trump, he says, let's go to Mexico.
[02:02:02.960 --> 02:02:05.320]  He says, I want to go to Mexico City, says Sheriff Joe,
[02:02:05.320 --> 02:02:07.760]  or somewhere in Mexico to talk to the officials.
[02:02:07.760 --> 02:02:10.720]  Sheriff Joe Arpaio says, now if Donald Trump wants to go
[02:02:10.720 --> 02:02:13.320]  with me, he can go with me because we both will talk
[02:02:13.320 --> 02:02:15.920]  about the economy, which is very critical.
[02:02:15.920 --> 02:02:17.640]  So I'm not going to give in on this one.
[02:02:17.640 --> 02:02:22.440]  Well, okay, the real issue, if you're going to go there,
[02:02:22.440 --> 02:02:23.640]  is about the war on drugs.
[02:02:23.640 --> 02:02:28.400]  And of course, Sheriff Joe is 100% for the war on drugs.
[02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:32.760]  The war on drugs that has failed now for 45 years,
[02:02:32.760 --> 02:02:36.320]  that has given us increased crime, increased corruption,
[02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:38.240]  increased drug use.
[02:02:38.240 --> 02:02:41.160]  It is nothing but a massive export of capital
[02:02:41.160 --> 02:02:44.480]  out of this country while we import crime.
[02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:46.240]  Why are we following this policy?
[02:02:46.240 --> 02:02:48.280]  Let me give you an example of how it's destroyed
[02:02:48.280 --> 02:02:49.800]  our legal system.
[02:02:49.800 --> 02:02:51.560]  Here's a story from the new American.
[02:02:51.560 --> 02:02:53.160]  This is out of Oklahoma.
[02:02:53.160 --> 02:02:56.840]  An Oklahoma DA used asset forfeiture money
[02:02:56.840 --> 02:02:58.920]  to pay his student loan.
[02:02:58.920 --> 02:03:02.200]  Now, asset forfeiture, civil asset forfeiture,
[02:03:02.200 --> 02:03:06.440]  is just outright theft by law enforcement.
[02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:07.560]  Here's a couple of examples.
[02:03:07.560 --> 02:03:09.400]  An assistant district attorney in the state of Oklahoma
[02:03:09.400 --> 02:03:12.640]  lived rent free in a house confiscated
[02:03:12.640 --> 02:03:15.000]  by local law enforcement under the practice
[02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:16.760]  of asset forfeiture.
[02:03:16.760 --> 02:03:18.800]  His office paid the utility bills.
[02:03:18.800 --> 02:03:20.680]  He remained there for five years,
[02:03:20.680 --> 02:03:24.720]  despite a court order to sell the house at auction.
[02:03:24.720 --> 02:03:26.800]  Another district attorney, second one,
[02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:29.880]  used $5,000 worth of confiscated funds
[02:03:29.880 --> 02:03:33.240]  to pay back his student loans.
[02:03:33.240 --> 02:03:37.640]  Now, this is a state senator in Oklahoma, Kyle Loveless.
[02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:39.840]  He says, the more I learn about it,
[02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:42.400]  the more upset and outraged I get
[02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:43.880]  that we've allowed this process
[02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:46.240]  to get to the point where it's at.
[02:03:46.240 --> 02:03:48.320]  He says, your property is considered guilty
[02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:49.960]  until proven innocent.
[02:03:49.960 --> 02:03:52.000]  It's up to the individual to petition the government
[02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.120]  after they've seized it to prove that it is innocent.
[02:03:54.120 --> 02:03:56.400]  To me, on the face, that's un-American.
[02:03:56.400 --> 02:03:58.760]  Look, it would be un-American
[02:03:58.760 --> 02:04:01.680]  if you were considered to be guilty
[02:04:01.680 --> 02:04:03.040]  and you had to prove you're innocent.
[02:04:03.040 --> 02:04:04.800]  Because we have the presumption,
[02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:08.080]  or supposed to have had, going back to the Magna Carta,
[02:04:08.080 --> 02:04:10.080]  we're supposed to have the presumption of innocence.
[02:04:10.080 --> 02:04:12.080]  Say, write to a trial by jury
[02:04:12.080 --> 02:04:14.160]  that we'd be found guilty of something
[02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:16.280]  before our property is confiscated.
[02:04:16.280 --> 02:04:18.520]  But it is none of those things.
[02:04:18.520 --> 02:04:19.840]  They take your property.
[02:04:19.840 --> 02:04:23.440]  Your property is accused of the crime.
[02:04:23.440 --> 02:04:25.440]  That's not un-American.
[02:04:25.440 --> 02:04:27.160]  That's Kafkaesque.
[02:04:27.160 --> 02:04:29.160]  That's like something out of a Kafka novel,
[02:04:29.160 --> 02:04:32.080]  saying that the property created a crime.
[02:04:32.080 --> 02:04:34.440]  Do you see how they twist the language?
[02:04:34.440 --> 02:04:35.760]  How they lie to us?
[02:04:35.760 --> 02:04:37.440]  How they steal from us?
[02:04:37.440 --> 02:04:39.640]  This is the war on drugs.
[02:04:39.640 --> 02:04:43.160]  This is the cause of the crime coming into our country.
[02:04:43.160 --> 02:04:45.840]  This is what created El Chapo.
[02:04:45.840 --> 02:04:47.440]  You wanna know how that guy became a billionaire
[02:04:47.440 --> 02:04:48.920]  the same way Al Capone did,
[02:04:48.920 --> 02:04:50.880]  except with Al Capone,
[02:04:50.880 --> 02:04:53.040]  there was a constitutional amendment for prohibition.
[02:04:53.040 --> 02:04:56.400]  We never even bothered to pass a prohibition amendment
[02:04:56.400 --> 02:04:57.480]  for the war on drugs.
[02:04:57.480 --> 02:04:58.720]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[02:04:58.720 --> 02:05:00.280]  A group called Concerned Citizens
[02:05:00.280 --> 02:05:02.040]  is petitioning an Iowa school district
[02:05:02.040 --> 02:05:05.040]  to prevent students from attending a conference on bullying.
[02:05:05.040 --> 02:05:06.800]  The conference was set up by an activist group
[02:05:06.800 --> 02:05:08.360]  called Iowa Safe Schools.
[02:05:08.360 --> 02:05:10.440]  It was the content of the conference held in April,
[02:05:10.440 --> 02:05:11.920]  which has parents up in arms.
[02:05:11.920 --> 02:05:13.600]  Among the nearly two dozen speakers,
[02:05:13.600 --> 02:05:15.120]  only two addressed bullying.
[02:05:15.120 --> 02:05:16.840]  The rest of the sessions involved issues
[02:05:16.840 --> 02:05:18.840]  such as how to pleasure their gay partners.
[02:05:18.840 --> 02:05:21.360]  Middle school girls learned how to sew fake testicles
[02:05:21.360 --> 02:05:23.400]  under their underwear in order to pass themselves off
[02:05:23.400 --> 02:05:24.240]  as boys.
[02:05:24.240 --> 02:05:27.040]  And the featured speaker, drag performer Miss Coco Peru,
[02:05:27.040 --> 02:05:28.920]  cursed a lot and encouraged attendees
[02:05:28.920 --> 02:05:31.880]  to vandalize the property of LGBT critics.
[02:05:31.880 --> 02:05:33.440]  One parent summed it up like this.
[02:05:33.440 --> 02:05:34.760]  It wasn't really on bullying.
[02:05:34.760 --> 02:05:37.520]  It was basically a sex ed class for same sex couples.
[02:05:37.520 --> 02:05:40.240]  Nate Monson, executive director of Iowa Safe Schools,
[02:05:40.240 --> 02:05:41.680]  said in response to the parents,
[02:05:41.680 --> 02:05:43.320]  it's incredibly frustrating that adults
[02:05:43.320 --> 02:05:45.120]  are being the problem and being the bully.
[02:05:45.120 --> 02:05:46.400]  We can do better in Iowa.
[02:05:46.400 --> 02:05:48.560]  The real plan is to sexualize your kids
[02:05:48.560 --> 02:05:50.640]  so more abortions can be performed.
[02:05:50.640 --> 02:05:52.280]  If you want to go deeper into the rabbit hole,
[02:05:52.280 --> 02:05:54.480]  check out the video, How Many People Would You Kill
[02:05:54.480 --> 02:05:56.720]  for a Million Dollars, on the Alex Jones channel
[02:05:56.720 --> 02:05:58.520]  and infowars.com.
[02:05:58.520 --> 02:06:01.800]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.

[02:07:07.400 --> 02:07:08.680]  For more than a decade,
[02:07:08.680 --> 02:07:10.160]  my favorite coffee has come
[02:07:10.160 --> 02:07:12.120]  from the high mountains of Southern Mexico,
[02:07:12.120 --> 02:07:13.520]  where the Chiapas farmers grow
[02:07:13.520 --> 02:07:15.800]  their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:07:15.800 --> 02:07:18.800]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans

[02:07:34.640 --> 02:07:36.520]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee,
[02:07:36.520 --> 02:07:39.120]  and it's taken us years to secure connections
[02:07:39.120 --> 02:07:41.640]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:07:41.640 --> 02:07:43.080]  Dropped by the site today,
[02:07:43.080 --> 02:07:44.160]  order a bag or two,
[02:07:44.160 --> 02:07:46.080]  and I don't think you're going to be disappointed,

[02:08:11.200 --> 02:08:12.200]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:12.200 --> 02:08:14.200]  I'm David Knight here in Austin.
[02:08:14.200 --> 02:08:16.200]  Joining us now from England is Alex Jones,
[02:08:16.200 --> 02:08:18.200]  as I mentioned before, he's in Europe,
[02:08:18.200 --> 02:08:20.200]  investigating globalist takeover.
[02:08:20.200 --> 02:08:22.200]  He's going to be filing a report
[02:08:22.200 --> 02:08:24.200]  for the first time in a while,
[02:08:24.200 --> 02:08:26.200]  and he's going to be working on it.
[02:08:26.200 --> 02:08:28.200]  He's going to be working on it.
[02:08:28.200 --> 02:08:30.200]  He's going to be working on it.
[02:08:30.200 --> 02:08:32.200]  He's going to be working on it.
[02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:34.200]  Globalist takeover.
[02:08:34.200 --> 02:08:36.200]  He's going to be filing reports all week,
[02:08:36.200 --> 02:08:38.200]  co-hosting from Europe,
[02:08:38.200 --> 02:08:40.200]  as he travels through there investigating it.
[02:08:40.200 --> 02:08:42.200]  Joining us live is Alex.
[02:08:42.200 --> 02:08:44.200]  Alex?
[02:08:44.200 --> 02:08:46.200]  That's right, David. Thank you for doing a great job.
[02:08:46.200 --> 02:08:48.200]  I'm going to be in the major cities of Madrid,
[02:08:48.200 --> 02:08:50.200]  Barcelona, Rome, Athens,
[02:08:50.200 --> 02:08:52.200]  you name it,
[02:08:52.200 --> 02:08:54.200]  in the next week and a half reporting live on what I see,
[02:08:54.200 --> 02:08:56.200]  but I want to stop off a few days
[02:08:56.200 --> 02:08:58.200]  here in the U.K.,
[02:08:58.200 --> 02:09:00.200]  in Jolio, England,
[02:09:00.200 --> 02:09:02.200]  travel around and see what I observe,
[02:09:02.200 --> 02:09:04.200]  watching television, listening to radio,
[02:09:04.200 --> 02:09:06.200]  talking to locals.
[02:09:06.200 --> 02:09:08.200]  The great news is there's a lot of info workers.
[02:09:08.200 --> 02:09:10.200]  We have video of this
[02:09:10.200 --> 02:09:12.200]  where we upload the next few days.
[02:09:12.200 --> 02:09:14.200]  For some reason, my YouTube code isn't working,
[02:09:14.200 --> 02:09:16.200]  so I can't upload videos,
[02:09:16.200 --> 02:09:18.200]  but Robert is finding tomorrow to meet me,
[02:09:18.200 --> 02:09:20.200]  so we'll be able to get all that up and online.
[02:09:20.200 --> 02:09:22.200]  And just people all in downtown London,
[02:09:22.200 --> 02:09:24.200]  people out in places like Avery,
[02:09:24.200 --> 02:09:26.200]  out in the countryside,
[02:09:26.200 --> 02:09:28.200]  people in small towns everywhere, gas stations,
[02:09:28.200 --> 02:09:30.200]  our huge listeners
[02:09:30.200 --> 02:09:32.200]  are aware of what's going on.
[02:09:32.200 --> 02:09:34.200]  They're Christians, they're Muslims,
[02:09:34.200 --> 02:09:36.200]  they're black, they're white, they're old, they're young.
[02:09:36.200 --> 02:09:38.200]  They're aware of what's going on,
[02:09:38.200 --> 02:09:40.200]  but watching BBC television
[02:09:40.200 --> 02:09:42.200]  on my hotel room early this morning,
[02:09:42.200 --> 02:09:44.200]  I already knew about this a few months ago,
[02:09:44.200 --> 02:09:46.200]  but I didn't know what to ask.
[02:09:46.200 --> 02:09:48.200]  They reported very calmly, David,
[02:09:48.200 --> 02:09:50.200]  like it was just talking about rain or something,
[02:09:50.200 --> 02:09:52.200]  or cricket game.
[02:09:52.200 --> 02:09:54.200]  They reported on that they had opened the tunnel
[02:09:54.200 --> 02:09:56.200]  after a month of being closed
[02:09:56.200 --> 02:09:58.200]  because he legals were pouring through
[02:09:58.200 --> 02:10:00.200]  by the thousands every day.
[02:10:00.200 --> 02:10:02.200]  The EU and France was,
[02:10:02.200 --> 02:10:04.200]  and the EU and France was letting them in
[02:10:04.200 --> 02:10:06.200]  on the trains, on the buses,
[02:10:06.200 --> 02:10:08.200]  they were hijacking 18 wheelers,
[02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:10.200]  started attacking people, started robbing people,
[02:10:10.200 --> 02:10:12.200]  because when you let them for years,
[02:10:12.200 --> 02:10:14.200]  pour through, and just ride on top of the vehicles
[02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:16.200]  on the trains, soon they start robbing
[02:10:16.200 --> 02:10:18.200]  the trains and beating people
[02:10:18.200 --> 02:10:20.200]  and attacking them, in some cases hijacking them
[02:10:20.200 --> 02:10:22.200]  and killing them.
[02:10:22.200 --> 02:10:24.200]  And then Nico, our producer for the TV audience,
[02:10:24.200 --> 02:10:26.200]  made a video many times the last month
[02:10:26.200 --> 02:10:28.200]  and a half of the hijacking of the buses,
[02:10:28.200 --> 02:10:30.200]  the hijacking of the 18 wheelers,
[02:10:30.200 --> 02:10:32.200]  the hijacking of the family cars.
[02:10:32.200 --> 02:10:34.200]  And this is, again, because Africa's collapsing,
[02:10:34.200 --> 02:10:36.200]  the Middle East is collapsing,
[02:10:36.200 --> 02:10:38.200]  much because the West has been destabilizing it.
[02:10:38.200 --> 02:10:40.200]  And so I'm just watching BBC,
[02:10:40.200 --> 02:10:42.200]  and I just calmly report
[02:10:42.200 --> 02:10:44.200]  that, well,
[02:10:44.200 --> 02:10:46.200]  most of the tunnel traffic and ferries are still closed,
[02:10:46.200 --> 02:10:48.200]  but some may be open soon.
[02:10:48.200 --> 02:10:50.200]  And so they just report it like it's no big deal.
[02:10:50.200 --> 02:10:52.200]  Imagine as globalism
[02:10:52.200 --> 02:10:54.200]  and as Unit 21 goes into high gear
[02:10:54.200 --> 02:10:56.200]  and sets off more and more resources,
[02:10:56.200 --> 02:10:58.200]  how insane this is going to get.
[02:10:58.200 --> 02:11:00.200]  But tomorrow, we're going to be covering
[02:11:00.200 --> 02:11:02.200]  with Paul Watson and Rob Dew and myself,
[02:11:02.200 --> 02:11:04.200]  the City of London within London.
[02:11:04.200 --> 02:11:06.200]  We'll be doing call-ins. We're going to be filing reports.
[02:11:06.200 --> 02:11:08.200]  You're, of course, going to be writing,
[02:11:08.200 --> 02:11:10.200]  you know, basically,
[02:11:10.200 --> 02:11:12.200]  the conductor here or as the grand,
[02:11:12.200 --> 02:11:14.200]  oh, who's the guy in an orchestra,
[02:11:14.200 --> 02:11:16.200]  the conductor who's running the whole show.
[02:11:16.200 --> 02:11:18.200]  And all weekend next week,
[02:11:18.200 --> 02:11:20.200]  we're going to have these reports
[02:11:20.200 --> 02:11:22.200]  on the hosting via Skype
[02:11:22.200 --> 02:11:24.200]  and a lot more for the radio
[02:11:24.200 --> 02:11:26.200]  and TV audience of InfoWars.com.
[02:11:26.200 --> 02:11:28.200]  But so much is going on here.
[02:11:28.200 --> 02:11:30.200]  But another thing I know is watching
[02:11:30.200 --> 02:11:32.200]  Sky Television,
[02:11:32.200 --> 02:11:34.200]  News Corp, Fox News here in the UK
[02:11:34.200 --> 02:11:36.200]  and also watching BBC
[02:11:36.200 --> 02:11:38.200]  and listening to it on radio,
[02:11:38.200 --> 02:11:40.200]  they are worshiping Obama.
[02:11:40.200 --> 02:11:42.200]  They are absolutely,
[02:11:42.200 --> 02:11:44.200]  he is the second coming of Christ
[02:11:44.200 --> 02:11:46.200]  and if you see the architecture,
[02:11:46.200 --> 02:11:48.200]  if you see what's happening to the resources,
[02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:50.200]  it's all in 21.
[02:11:50.200 --> 02:11:52.200]  It's all about cutting the resources off,
[02:11:52.200 --> 02:11:54.200]  charging people for more.
[02:11:54.200 --> 02:11:56.200]  It's all about creating austerity.
[02:11:56.200 --> 02:11:58.200]  This is absolute total
[02:11:58.200 --> 02:12:00.200]  social engineering.
[02:12:00.200 --> 02:12:02.200]  But the good news is it transcends life to right.
[02:12:02.200 --> 02:12:04.200]  People are really starting to wake up
[02:12:04.200 --> 02:12:06.200]  and really starting to realize what's happening, David.
[02:12:06.200 --> 02:12:08.200]  So, again, we're going to be here with you
[02:12:08.200 --> 02:12:10.200]  and the crew there in Austin, Texas,
[02:12:10.200 --> 02:12:12.200]  breaking this down, filing the tailed
[02:12:12.200 --> 02:12:14.200]  HD reports on the ground
[02:12:14.200 --> 02:12:16.200]  but also doing live call-ins,
[02:12:16.200 --> 02:12:18.200]  all sorts of original videos
[02:12:18.200 --> 02:12:20.200]  and especially produced reports
[02:12:20.200 --> 02:12:22.200]  looking over this because you can watch TV,
[02:12:22.200 --> 02:12:24.200]  I can talk to experts,
[02:12:24.200 --> 02:12:26.200]  I can read the financial publications all day long
[02:12:26.200 --> 02:12:28.200]  but to get on the ground
[02:12:28.200 --> 02:12:30.200]  and to actually see what's happening
[02:12:30.200 --> 02:12:32.200]  in Spain with 35% unemployment
[02:12:32.200 --> 02:12:34.200]  or the UK with
[02:12:34.200 --> 02:12:36.200]  45% of people on the dole
[02:12:36.200 --> 02:12:38.200]  or welfare or to see what's happening
[02:12:38.200 --> 02:12:40.200]  in Athens Grays to see what's happening
[02:12:40.200 --> 02:12:42.200]  in Rome, Italy,
[02:12:42.200 --> 02:12:44.200]  where two weeks ago the one on Telegraph reported
[02:12:44.200 --> 02:12:46.200]  on the verge of collapse,
[02:12:46.200 --> 02:12:48.200]  months of rotting garbage on the streets,
[02:12:48.200 --> 02:12:50.200]  huge immigrant populations
[02:12:50.200 --> 02:12:52.200]  pouring in
[02:12:52.200 --> 02:12:54.200]  that the EU then puts on welfare
[02:12:54.200 --> 02:12:56.200]  to further bankrupt the countries.
[02:12:56.200 --> 02:12:58.200]  I mean, this is a front row seat
[02:12:58.200 --> 02:13:00.200]  to economic warfare.
[02:13:00.200 --> 02:13:02.200]  We're not being captured taking over by tanks.
[02:13:02.200 --> 02:13:04.200]  We're being captured taking over by banks
[02:13:04.200 --> 02:13:06.200]  and so that's why I'm here
[02:13:06.200 --> 02:13:08.200]  in the EU covering all of this
[02:13:08.200 --> 02:13:10.200]  because I sent the reporters Rob Do
[02:13:10.200 --> 02:13:12.200]  and Josh Owens and others
[02:13:12.200 --> 02:13:14.200]  from Boulderburg a few months ago
[02:13:14.200 --> 02:13:16.200]  I sent Joe Biggs down to the border
[02:13:16.200 --> 02:13:18.200]  and that made national news with Josh Owens
[02:13:18.200 --> 02:13:20.200]  and of course they caught the footage
[02:13:20.200 --> 02:13:22.200]  of the drugs being brought in across.
[02:13:22.200 --> 02:13:24.200]  You were just exposing the drug wall.
[02:13:24.200 --> 02:13:26.200]  It's not that we're for throwing people in jail for drugs.
[02:13:26.200 --> 02:13:28.200]  We realize the whole thing's a fraud.
[02:13:28.200 --> 02:13:30.200]  They made the drugs illegal to jack up the prices
[02:13:30.200 --> 02:13:32.200]  and control the population
[02:13:32.200 --> 02:13:34.200]  but still regardless,
[02:13:34.200 --> 02:13:36.200]  they're telling us we're taking your rights
[02:13:36.200 --> 02:13:38.200]  and keep you safe from drugs and terrorism.
[02:13:38.200 --> 02:13:40.200]  The truth is just like narcotics
[02:13:40.200 --> 02:13:42.200]  are run by the criminal mega banks
[02:13:42.200 --> 02:13:44.200]  that have hijacked this country.
[02:13:44.200 --> 02:13:46.200]  They are the enemies
[02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:48.200]  and if we can't identify that organization
[02:13:48.200 --> 02:13:50.200]  if we can't reveal what they've done
[02:13:50.200 --> 02:13:52.200]  we have absolutely no hope
[02:13:52.200 --> 02:13:54.200]  but the good news is
[02:13:54.200 --> 02:13:56.200]  as the real enemies are identified
[02:13:56.200 --> 02:13:58.200]  and as the people of the world come together
[02:13:58.200 --> 02:14:00.200]  it's over. The most important thing I can say
[02:14:00.200 --> 02:14:02.200]  is to the listeners
[02:14:02.200 --> 02:14:04.200]  but I've already run into at the airport
[02:14:04.200 --> 02:14:06.200]  and at my hotel
[02:14:06.200 --> 02:14:08.200]  and then out in the middle of nowhere
[02:14:08.200 --> 02:14:10.200]  I go into a pub
[02:14:10.200 --> 02:14:12.200]  there's like 15 people in it
[02:14:12.200 --> 02:14:14.200]  six of them know who I am
[02:14:14.200 --> 02:14:16.200]  and come over and say to their listeners
[02:14:16.200 --> 02:14:18.200]  six people, 15 people
[02:14:18.200 --> 02:14:20.200]  at the red lion
[02:14:20.200 --> 02:14:22.200]  pub
[02:14:22.200 --> 02:14:24.200]  and inn in Avery
[02:14:24.200 --> 02:14:26.200]  that's where I am right now
[02:14:26.200 --> 02:14:28.200]  I'm not staying there. I'm about to leave
[02:14:28.200 --> 02:14:30.200]  but the point is I'm about to go back to London
[02:14:30.200 --> 02:14:32.200]  the point is that's what's happening
[02:14:32.200 --> 02:14:34.200]  that's what's going on
[02:14:34.200 --> 02:14:36.200]  that's the power of people seeking out the truth
[02:14:36.200 --> 02:14:38.200]  they don't know
[02:14:38.200 --> 02:14:40.200]  that there's a movement worldwide
[02:14:40.200 --> 02:14:42.200]  to this. They don't know how much power
[02:14:42.200 --> 02:14:44.200]  the Liberty Movement has
[02:14:44.200 --> 02:14:46.200]  so when I bring this up, I'm bragging
[02:14:46.200 --> 02:14:48.200]  I'm letting them know you're not alone
[02:14:48.200 --> 02:14:50.200]  you have fellow Liberty lovers
[02:14:50.200 --> 02:14:52.200]  but we race color and creed around the world
[02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:54.200]  that are aware of what's happening
[02:14:54.200 --> 02:14:56.200]  and understand that the globalists
[02:14:56.200 --> 02:14:58.200]  are bringing in this tyrannical anti-human world
[02:14:58.200 --> 02:15:00.200]  government and that the collapse
[02:15:00.200 --> 02:15:02.200]  that they're orchestrating to bring in total control
[02:15:02.200 --> 02:15:04.200]  is imminent.
[02:15:04.200 --> 02:15:06.200]  We hope to hold back their program
[02:15:06.200 --> 02:15:08.200]  we hope to hold back their agenda David
[02:15:08.200 --> 02:15:10.200]  as you do but in case we don't hold it back
[02:15:10.200 --> 02:15:12.200]  people need to know who did it
[02:15:12.200 --> 02:15:14.200]  and the way out of it because they're going to use socialism
[02:15:14.200 --> 02:15:16.200]  collectivism
[02:15:16.200 --> 02:15:18.200]  and total control
[02:15:18.200 --> 02:15:20.200]  as the so-called answer
[02:15:20.200 --> 02:15:22.200]  to the crisis that they've helped basically create
[02:15:22.200 --> 02:15:24.200]  so David I really appreciate you doing a great job
[02:15:24.200 --> 02:15:26.200]  while I'm gone and the rest of the crew
[02:15:26.200 --> 02:15:28.200]  and I'm going to go ahead and hand the reins
[02:15:28.200 --> 02:15:30.200]  back over to you my friends because
[02:15:30.200 --> 02:15:32.200]  it's not just about Alex Jones or anybody
[02:15:32.200 --> 02:15:34.200]  or David Knight it's all of you
[02:15:34.200 --> 02:15:36.200]  that are the human resistance
[02:15:36.200 --> 02:15:38.200]  to the globalists in this high-tech tyranny.
[02:15:38.200 --> 02:15:40.200]  Thank you Alex it's very interesting
[02:15:40.200 --> 02:15:42.200]  too to hear you talk about how they're treating
[02:15:42.200 --> 02:15:44.200]  Obama as God because of course
[02:15:44.200 --> 02:15:46.200]  we've seen the clips of him talking about gun control
[02:15:46.200 --> 02:15:48.200]  but the other thing he said was
[02:15:48.200 --> 02:15:50.200]  England needs to stay in the EU
[02:15:50.200 --> 02:15:52.200]  don't leave the EU
[02:15:52.200 --> 02:15:54.200]  and he's saying we need you
[02:15:54.200 --> 02:15:56.200]  you're an important transatlantic
[02:15:56.200 --> 02:15:58.200]  partner.
[02:15:58.200 --> 02:16:00.200]  They don't want to see anybody get out of the EU
[02:16:00.200 --> 02:16:02.200]  they want to keep everybody in the EU
[02:16:02.200 --> 02:16:04.200]  because they are now consolidating
[02:16:04.200 --> 02:16:06.200]  these regional groups into the next
[02:16:06.200 --> 02:16:08.200]  step of global governance but as Alex
[02:16:08.200 --> 02:16:10.200]  was pointing out this global
[02:16:10.200 --> 02:16:12.200]  collapse of the economy look at how it's playing
[02:16:12.200 --> 02:16:14.200]  out in Puerto Rico for example
[02:16:14.200 --> 02:16:16.200]  we've got
[02:16:16.200 --> 02:16:18.200]  an article from Wolf Street pointing out that
[02:16:18.200 --> 02:16:20.200]  UBS's Puerto Rico bond funds
[02:16:20.200 --> 02:16:22.200]  are imploding collateral
[02:16:22.200 --> 02:16:24.200]  value has dropped to zero
[02:16:24.200 --> 02:16:26.200]  investors are screwed
[02:16:26.200 --> 02:16:28.200]  that's the headline.
[02:16:28.200 --> 02:16:30.200]  We believe the probability of default is approaching
[02:16:30.200 --> 02:16:32.200]  100% and that losses
[02:16:32.200 --> 02:16:34.200]  given default are substantial
[02:16:34.200 --> 02:16:36.200]  that's from Moody's the people that rate
[02:16:36.200 --> 02:16:38.200]  these bond funds
[02:16:38.200 --> 02:16:40.200]  they're talking about $72 billion
[02:16:40.200 --> 02:16:42.200]  in bonds that were stuffed
[02:16:42.200 --> 02:16:44.200]  into numerous conservative sounding
[02:16:44.200 --> 02:16:46.200]  bond funds spread across
[02:16:46.200 --> 02:16:48.200]  America's retirement portfolios
[02:16:48.200 --> 02:16:50.200]  where have we seen this before
[02:16:50.200 --> 02:16:52.200]  does this sound like the collapse
[02:16:52.200 --> 02:16:54.200]  of the mortgage market well now they're doing
[02:16:54.200 --> 02:16:56.200]  it with municipal bonds in other countries
[02:16:56.200 --> 02:16:58.200]  like in Puerto Rico
[02:16:58.200 --> 02:17:00.200]  this is the way this all
[02:17:00.200 --> 02:17:02.200]  plays out this is why there is massive
[02:17:02.200 --> 02:17:04.200]  immigration that is faster
[02:17:04.200 --> 02:17:06.200]  than the economies can absorb
[02:17:06.200 --> 02:17:08.200]  from third world countries into
[02:17:08.200 --> 02:17:10.200]  first world countries just as Alex was
[02:17:10.200 --> 02:17:12.200]  talking about going on in Europe
[02:17:12.200 --> 02:17:14.200]  that's why they're doing this they have
[02:17:14.200 --> 02:17:16.200]  to implode the first world economies
[02:17:16.200 --> 02:17:18.200]  in the same way they've gone to all of these
[02:17:18.200 --> 02:17:20.200]  third world economies after World War II
[02:17:20.200 --> 02:17:22.200]  they went in essentially operating
[02:17:22.200 --> 02:17:24.200]  as rent seekers
[02:17:24.200 --> 02:17:26.200]  setting these countries up
[02:17:26.200 --> 02:17:28.200]  on massive loans from
[02:17:28.200 --> 02:17:30.200]  the IMF from the World Bank from the
[02:17:30.200 --> 02:17:32.200]  central bankers the same people
[02:17:32.200 --> 02:17:34.200]  that we see as the Troika
[02:17:34.200 --> 02:17:36.200]  hammering Greece
[02:17:36.200 --> 02:17:38.200]  they came in they said we want you to
[02:17:38.200 --> 02:17:40.200]  create a socialist
[02:17:40.200 --> 02:17:42.200]  state and we're going to loan you money
[02:17:42.200 --> 02:17:44.200]  that you can just turn around and hand back
[02:17:44.200 --> 02:17:46.200]  in nonproductive ways to the poor
[02:17:46.200 --> 02:17:48.200]  in your country instead of making people
[02:17:48.200 --> 02:17:50.200]  wealthy we're going to have you
[02:17:50.200 --> 02:17:52.200]  put them on a welfare
[02:17:52.200 --> 02:17:54.200]  program and eventually
[02:17:54.200 --> 02:17:56.200]  what happens is you run out of
[02:17:56.200 --> 02:17:58.200]  other people's money
[02:17:58.200 --> 02:18:00.200]  and when you run out of other people's money
[02:18:00.200 --> 02:18:02.200]  they come in and they take your
[02:18:02.200 --> 02:18:04.200]  hard assets that's what's going on in Greece
[02:18:04.200 --> 02:18:06.200]  again going on back to Puerto Rico
[02:18:06.200 --> 02:18:08.200]  they say about 26 billion dollars in
[02:18:08.200 --> 02:18:10.200]  bonds fall into this category
[02:18:10.200 --> 02:18:12.200]  things like the government's development bank
[02:18:12.200 --> 02:18:14.200]  highways and transportation authority
[02:18:14.200 --> 02:18:16.200]  infrastructure finance authority
[02:18:16.200 --> 02:18:18.200]  municipal finance authority so
[02:18:18.200 --> 02:18:20.200]  now these
[02:18:20.200 --> 02:18:22.200]  things that would be building infrastructure
[02:18:22.200 --> 02:18:24.200]  they're no longer able to support these
[02:18:24.200 --> 02:18:26.200]  because the massive
[02:18:26.200 --> 02:18:28.200]  overextending of credit largely to pay
[02:18:28.200 --> 02:18:30.200]  for welfare programs
[02:18:30.200 --> 02:18:32.200]  they're pointing out that UBS
[02:18:32.200 --> 02:18:34.200]  is heavily involved in this they say UBS
[02:18:34.200 --> 02:18:36.200]  despite well-known problems that Puerto Rico
[02:18:36.200 --> 02:18:38.200]  has been having for years was not shy
[02:18:38.200 --> 02:18:40.200]  about loading up its
[02:18:40.200 --> 02:18:42.200]  clients with these worthless
[02:18:42.200 --> 02:18:44.200]  bonds same thing we saw happen
[02:18:44.200 --> 02:18:46.200]  in the mortgage build up remember
[02:18:46.200 --> 02:18:48.200]  they collateralized all these things they sold
[02:18:48.200 --> 02:18:50.200]  out there
[02:18:50.200 --> 02:18:52.200]  as
[02:18:52.200 --> 02:18:54.200]  as good investments when they were just
[02:18:54.200 --> 02:18:56.200]  garbage mortgage loans
[02:18:56.200 --> 02:18:58.200]  they say they encourage people to borrow
[02:18:58.200 --> 02:19:00.200]  money from UBS in order to
[02:19:00.200 --> 02:19:02.200]  buy these things do it on credit do it
[02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:04.200]  with leverage
[02:19:04.200 --> 02:19:06.200]  that's why so many people say we need to
[02:19:06.200 --> 02:19:08.200]  go back to Glass-Steagall
[02:19:08.200 --> 02:19:10.200]  we need to make sure that the banks
[02:19:10.200 --> 02:19:12.200]  who are insured by
[02:19:12.200 --> 02:19:14.200]  the by the countries
[02:19:14.200 --> 02:19:16.200]  are not going to be allowed
[02:19:16.200 --> 02:19:18.200]  to participate in this kind of highly
[02:19:18.200 --> 02:19:20.200]  leveraged activity that we saw happen
[02:19:20.200 --> 02:19:22.200]  with the mortgage implosion but of
[02:19:22.200 --> 02:19:24.200]  course they're doing it here they're doing it in Puerto Rico
[02:19:24.200 --> 02:19:26.200]  and they say that since the collapse
[02:19:26.200 --> 02:19:28.200]  of Puerto Rico bonds the funds have become
[02:19:28.200 --> 02:19:30.200]  quote-unquote legal headaches
[02:19:30.200 --> 02:19:32.200]  for UBS as Reuters
[02:19:32.200 --> 02:19:34.200]  put it we see the same
[02:19:34.200 --> 02:19:36.200]  pattern of behavior everywhere
[02:19:36.200 --> 02:19:38.200]  from these banks
[02:19:38.200 --> 02:19:40.200]  and now we have a massive
[02:19:40.200 --> 02:19:42.200]  exodus of people from Puerto Rico
[02:19:42.200 --> 02:19:44.200]  that are going to Florida
[02:19:44.200 --> 02:19:46.200]  these are people who are U.S. citizens
[02:19:46.200 --> 02:19:48.200]  they will be allowed to vote in Florida
[02:19:48.200 --> 02:19:50.200]  it will change the landscape

[02:22:09.200 --> 02:22:12.200]  an older person will typically injure more easily
[02:22:12.200 --> 02:22:13.200]  and heal more slowly
[02:22:13.200 --> 02:22:14.200]  not fun
[02:22:14.200 --> 02:22:16.200]  however if you can consume a protein powder
[02:22:16.200 --> 02:22:18.200]  that is easier to absorb
[02:22:18.200 --> 02:22:20.200]  then you may be able to gain back some strength

[02:24:08.200 --> 02:24:09.200]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show
[02:24:09.200 --> 02:24:11.200]  I'm David Knight your host
[02:24:11.200 --> 02:24:13.200]  and we just heard from Alex
[02:24:13.200 --> 02:24:15.200]  he's in England right now
[02:24:15.200 --> 02:24:17.200]  he's going to be traveling
[02:24:17.200 --> 02:24:19.200]  across Europe investigating
[02:24:19.200 --> 02:24:21.200]  the globalist takeover
[02:24:21.200 --> 02:24:24.200]  what they're doing to collapse the areas economically
[02:24:24.200 --> 02:24:27.200]  so they can then move in and take their sovereignty
[02:24:27.200 --> 02:24:30.200]  that's been the goal of the stated goal
[02:24:30.200 --> 02:24:33.200]  these people I say the only way we're going to solve these problems
[02:24:33.200 --> 02:24:37.200]  in Portugal and Italy and Ireland and Greece and Spain
[02:24:37.200 --> 02:24:39.200]  is for them to give up their sovereignty
[02:24:39.200 --> 02:24:40.200]  Alan Greenspan said it
[02:24:40.200 --> 02:24:42.200]  the head of the largest bond fund in the world
[02:24:42.200 --> 02:24:43.200]  PIMCO said it
[02:24:43.200 --> 02:24:45.200]  many people have said that
[02:24:45.200 --> 02:24:47.200]  they actually have done that now
[02:24:47.200 --> 02:24:49.200]  in Greece they held a referendum
[02:24:49.200 --> 02:24:51.200]  but no we don't like the terms that the Troika has given us
[02:24:51.200 --> 02:24:53.200]  and they said well we don't care
[02:24:53.200 --> 02:24:56.200]  we're going to set economic rules for you
[02:24:56.200 --> 02:24:59.200]  we're going to give you a long list of regulations
[02:24:59.200 --> 02:25:02.200]  we're going to take 50 billion euros worth of hard assets
[02:25:02.200 --> 02:25:04.200]  we're going to extend credit to you
[02:25:04.200 --> 02:25:07.200]  of another 36 billion so you can continue to make payments
[02:25:07.200 --> 02:25:08.200]  get further in debt
[02:25:08.200 --> 02:25:10.200]  extend and pretend that you're getting out of debt
[02:25:10.200 --> 02:25:13.200]  that's the way they're rolling this thing out
[02:25:13.200 --> 02:25:16.200]  this is going to be the plan for every one of us
[02:25:16.200 --> 02:25:19.200]  we need to learn from the tragic mistakes
[02:25:19.200 --> 02:25:21.200]  that have been made in Greece
[02:25:21.200 --> 02:25:22.200]  we need to stop this
[02:25:22.200 --> 02:25:24.200]  we need to pull back as Alex pointed out
[02:25:24.200 --> 02:25:27.200]  Obama is being hailed by the British media
[02:25:27.200 --> 02:25:28.200]  that's what he sees there
[02:25:28.200 --> 02:25:30.200]  they're hailing him as a savior
[02:25:30.200 --> 02:25:31.200]  why?
[02:25:31.200 --> 02:25:33.200]  because he's there pushing back
[02:25:33.200 --> 02:25:35.200]  against the rising movement
[02:25:35.200 --> 02:25:36.200]  in all these different countries
[02:25:36.200 --> 02:25:38.200]  to try to get out of this European Union
[02:25:38.200 --> 02:25:40.200]  he's saying no don't get out
[02:25:40.200 --> 02:25:41.200]  we need you
[02:25:41.200 --> 02:25:45.200]  you're important partners in the transatlantic union
[02:25:45.200 --> 02:25:47.200]  that's what they're pushing now with everybody
[02:25:47.200 --> 02:25:49.200]  but people are starting to see the handwriting on the wall
[02:25:49.200 --> 02:25:51.200]  as they realize this is a secret treaty
[02:25:51.200 --> 02:25:53.200]  the TTIP
[02:25:53.200 --> 02:25:55.200]  the TPP are both secret treaties
[02:25:55.200 --> 02:25:58.200]  that have been negotiated and written by corporations
[02:25:58.200 --> 02:26:00.200]  our elected representatives
[02:26:00.200 --> 02:26:02.200]  are not even allowed to see them
[02:26:02.200 --> 02:26:04.200]  let alone us
[02:26:04.200 --> 02:26:07.200]  so this whole thing is a sham
[02:26:07.200 --> 02:26:09.200]  and again Alex is going to be joining us all week
[02:26:09.200 --> 02:26:10.200]  with reports from there
[02:26:10.200 --> 02:26:12.200]  we're going to be joined in the next segment
[02:26:12.200 --> 02:26:14.200]  by Paul Joseph Watson
[02:26:14.200 --> 02:26:17.200]  there's an article that's up on Drudge
[02:26:17.200 --> 02:26:21.200]  it's another petition video from Mark Dice
[02:26:21.200 --> 02:26:23.200]  getting liberals to sign a petition
[02:26:23.200 --> 02:26:26.200]  to impose a 10% male privilege tax
[02:26:26.200 --> 02:26:28.200]  and Paul Joseph Watson points out in his article
[02:26:28.200 --> 02:26:30.200]  that wraps that video
[02:26:30.200 --> 02:26:33.200]  despite the fact that the gender pay gap
[02:26:33.200 --> 02:26:35.200]  is a complete myth
[02:26:35.200 --> 02:26:37.200]  so we're going to talk to Paul Joseph Watson about that
[02:26:37.200 --> 02:26:39.200]  in the next segment
[02:26:39.200 --> 02:26:41.200]  now before we go to that I just want to let you know
[02:26:41.200 --> 02:26:43.200]  this hour the Alex Jones show
[02:26:43.200 --> 02:26:45.200]  is brought to you by the products that we sell
[02:26:45.200 --> 02:26:47.200]  at InfowarsLife.com
[02:26:47.200 --> 02:26:49.200]  we now have in stock
[02:26:49.200 --> 02:26:51.200]  Survival Shield X2
[02:26:51.200 --> 02:26:53.200]  remember we have free shipping for just a couple more days
[02:26:53.200 --> 02:26:55.200]  in the month of July
[02:26:55.200 --> 02:26:57.200]  X2 has over 400 positive reviews
[02:26:57.200 --> 02:26:59.200]  on InfowarsLife.com
[02:26:59.200 --> 02:27:01.200]  over 99% of those reviews
[02:27:01.200 --> 02:27:03.200]  the people say they would recommend it
[02:27:03.200 --> 02:27:05.200]  to a friend or a family member
[02:27:05.200 --> 02:27:07.200]  so take a look at those reviews
[02:27:07.200 --> 02:27:09.200]  about nascent iodine
[02:27:09.200 --> 02:27:11.200]  that Survival Shield X2
[02:27:11.200 --> 02:27:13.200]  at InfowarsLife.com
[02:27:13.200 --> 02:27:15.200]  also we still have in supply
[02:27:15.200 --> 02:27:17.200]  some of our newest product Deep Cleanse
[02:27:17.200 --> 02:27:19.200]  that was just introduced last week
[02:27:19.200 --> 02:27:21.200]  it sold out half of the
[02:27:21.200 --> 02:27:23.200]  of the large shipment that we got in
[02:27:23.200 --> 02:27:25.200]  Alex said he doubled the size of the shipment
[02:27:25.200 --> 02:27:27.200]  nevertheless half of it sold out in the first day
[02:27:27.200 --> 02:27:29.200]  we've sold out about 85%
[02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:31.200]  of this first run but it is still
[02:27:31.200 --> 02:27:33.200]  available at InfowarsLife.com
[02:27:33.200 --> 02:27:35.200]  Deep Cleanse is an all-in-one
[02:27:35.200 --> 02:27:37.200]  total body cleanser that uses nano colloidal
[02:27:37.200 --> 02:27:39.200]  zeolites
[02:27:39.200 --> 02:27:41.200]  organic ingredients to cleanse chemicals
[02:27:41.200 --> 02:27:43.200]  and toxic metals from the body
[02:27:43.200 --> 02:27:45.200]  it's a way to
[02:27:45.200 --> 02:27:47.200]  fight back against all the toxic
[02:27:47.200 --> 02:27:49.200]  pesticides, herbicides, fungicides
[02:27:49.200 --> 02:27:51.200]  and metals that are in your food supply
[02:27:51.200 --> 02:27:53.200]  again you can get that at InfowarsLife.com
[02:27:53.200 --> 02:27:55.200]  it's nearly sold out
[02:27:55.200 --> 02:27:57.200]  but we still have some of that left
[02:27:57.200 --> 02:27:59.200]  and anything that you get
[02:27:59.200 --> 02:28:01.200]  at InfowarsLife.com is free
[02:28:01.200 --> 02:28:03.200]  shipping through the end of July
[02:28:03.200 --> 02:28:05.200]  there's only 3 or 4 days left
[02:28:05.200 --> 02:28:07.200]  of that
[02:28:07.200 --> 02:28:09.200]  Paul Joseph Watson is going to be coming on
[02:28:09.200 --> 02:28:11.200]  the next segment to talk to us about this
[02:28:11.200 --> 02:28:13.200]  article that he wrote
[02:28:13.200 --> 02:28:15.200]  around the video that
[02:28:15.200 --> 02:28:17.200]  Mark Dice did having liberals
[02:28:17.200 --> 02:28:19.200]  sign a petition to impose
[02:28:19.200 --> 02:28:21.200]  a 10% mail privilege
[02:28:21.200 --> 02:28:23.200]  tax let's take a look at that video
[02:28:23.200 --> 02:28:25.200]  I'm going to ask people
[02:28:25.200 --> 02:28:27.200]  to help fight income inequality
[02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:29.200]  by signing a petition to tax
[02:28:29.200 --> 02:28:31.200]  men at a higher rate
[02:28:31.200 --> 02:28:33.200]  calling it the mail privilege tax
[02:28:33.200 --> 02:28:35.200]  to see if these feminist
[02:28:35.200 --> 02:28:37.200]  fools will sign a sexist
[02:28:37.200 --> 02:28:39.200]  petition to fight
[02:28:39.200 --> 02:28:41.200]  supposed sexism we're trying to
[02:28:41.200 --> 02:28:43.200]  implement a mail privilege tax
[02:28:43.200 --> 02:28:45.200]  really how's that work
[02:28:45.200 --> 02:28:47.200]  it would be just a simple 10% tax on
[02:28:47.200 --> 02:28:49.200]  men's income since they make more money
[02:28:49.200 --> 02:28:51.200]  just to help offset the costs
[02:28:51.200 --> 02:28:53.200]  and the incomes that's really interesting
[02:28:53.200 --> 02:28:55.200]  and we need a few more signatures to
[02:28:55.200 --> 02:28:57.200]  support the mail privilege tax definitely
[02:28:57.200 --> 02:28:59.200]  signed for that definitely signed for that
[02:28:59.200 --> 02:29:01.200]  you know these women you guys don't
[02:29:01.200 --> 02:29:03.200]  make as much money
[02:29:03.200 --> 02:29:05.200]  you know men make so much more money
[02:29:05.200 --> 02:29:07.200]  than the women the thing we
[02:29:07.200 --> 02:29:09.200]  can do to fight sexism
[02:29:09.200 --> 02:29:11.200]  is to really implement the mail
[02:29:11.200 --> 02:29:13.200]  privilege tax I've never heard of that
[02:29:13.200 --> 02:29:15.200]  before but whatever they're
[02:29:15.200 --> 02:29:17.200]  trying to do right now is clearly not working
[02:29:17.200 --> 02:29:19.200]  so I'm all for giving it a shot
[02:29:19.200 --> 02:29:21.200]  no privilege tax will definitely
[02:29:21.200 --> 02:29:23.200]  solve a lot of these sexist
[02:29:23.200 --> 02:29:25.200]  problems that's the other guy
[02:29:25.200 --> 02:29:27.200]  you're not women make a lot less money
[02:29:27.200 --> 02:29:29.200]  than men and so we're going to implement the mail privilege
[02:29:29.200 --> 02:29:31.200]  tax just to just to tax
[02:29:31.200 --> 02:29:33.200]  the men at a slightly higher rate to help
[02:29:33.200 --> 02:29:35.200]  offset the income inequality
[02:29:35.200 --> 02:29:37.200]  need a few more signatures
[02:29:37.200 --> 02:29:39.200]  print your name, birthday
[02:29:39.200 --> 02:29:41.200]  and a signature
[02:29:41.200 --> 02:29:43.200]  okay so we're going to have
[02:29:43.200 --> 02:29:45.200]  Paul Joseph Watson we're going to play a little bit
[02:29:45.200 --> 02:29:47.200]  more of that for you and he's going to talk about
[02:29:47.200 --> 02:29:49.200]  the reality we're on the march
[02:29:49.200 --> 02:29:51.200]  the empires on the run
[02:29:51.200 --> 02:29:53.200]  Alex Jones and the GCN
[02:29:53.200 --> 02:30:03.200]  radio network
[02:30:23.200 --> 02:30:25.200]  so what's it going to take
[02:30:25.200 --> 02:30:27.200]  I mean what will it take to finally wake you up
[02:30:27.200 --> 02:30:29.200]  think about it if Joseph Stalin
[02:30:29.200 --> 02:30:31.200]  ran for president as a democrat
[02:30:31.200 --> 02:30:33.200]  and Adolf Hitler ran as a republican
[02:30:33.200 --> 02:30:35.200]  one of them would end up
[02:30:35.200 --> 02:30:37.200]  leading our country
[02:30:37.200 --> 02:30:39.200]  it's politics incorporated
[02:30:39.200 --> 02:30:41.200]  and your choice between the two
[02:30:41.200 --> 02:30:43.200]  parties is a myth
[02:30:43.200 --> 02:30:45.200]  because in reality it is a two party
[02:30:45.200 --> 02:30:47.200]  tyranny with one
[02:30:47.200 --> 02:30:49.200]  ideology divide and conquer
[02:30:49.200 --> 02:30:51.200]  so join the revolution
[02:30:51.200 --> 02:30:53.200]  and break the false left
[02:30:53.200 --> 02:30:55.200]  versus right paradigm
[02:30:55.200 --> 02:31:23.200]  before the days of the Roman Empire
[02:31:23.200 --> 02:31:25.200]  we're going to start with
[02:31:25.200 --> 02:31:27.200]  the first
[02:31:27.200 --> 02:31:29.200]  from top leading manufacturers
[02:31:29.200 --> 02:31:31.200]  to ensure a concentrated level
[02:31:31.200 --> 02:31:33.200]  of bioactive ingredients
[02:31:33.200 --> 02:31:35.200]  extracted directly from the wild herb
[02:31:35.200 --> 02:31:37.200]  and sealed in easy to use capsules
[02:31:37.200 --> 02:31:39.200]  you will no longer need to endure
[02:31:39.200 --> 02:31:41.200]  the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue
[02:31:41.200 --> 02:31:43.200]  wild crafted from the
[02:31:43.200 --> 02:31:45.200]  Mediterranean oregano species
[02:31:45.200 --> 02:31:47.200]  that experts agree is one of the most powerful
[02:31:47.200 --> 02:31:49.200]  and most challenging to acquire
[02:31:49.200 --> 02:31:51.200]  this winter season is more important than ever
[02:31:51.200 --> 02:31:53.200]  we're going to run at
[02:31:53.200 --> 02:31:55.200]  infowarslife.com
[02:31:55.200 --> 02:31:57.200]  that's infowarslife.com

[02:32:03.200 --> 02:32:05.200]  consumer alert report
[02:32:05.200 --> 02:32:07.200]  many of you are aware
[02:32:07.200 --> 02:32:09.200]  that around the world
[02:32:09.200 --> 02:32:11.200]  most populations are woefully deficient
[02:32:11.200 --> 02:32:13.200]  in clean forms of iodine
[02:32:13.200 --> 02:32:15.200]  iodine is the good member of the halogen family
[02:32:15.200 --> 02:32:17.200]  things like fluoride are the bad halogens
[02:32:17.200 --> 02:32:19.200]  the good news is
[02:32:19.200 --> 02:32:21.200]  in the past two years
[02:32:21.200 --> 02:32:23.200]  tried X2 nascent iodine
[02:32:23.200 --> 02:32:25.200]  and experienced it for themselves
[02:32:25.200 --> 02:32:27.200]  the bad news is
[02:32:27.200 --> 02:32:29.200]  the supply of these deep earth crystals
[02:32:29.200 --> 02:32:31.200]  that exclusive

[02:32:37.200 --> 02:32:39.200]  and that supply is running low
[02:32:39.200 --> 02:32:41.200]  and is in question
[02:32:41.200 --> 02:32:43.200]  that's why it's more important than ever
[02:32:43.200 --> 02:32:45.200]  to secure your current and long time supply
[02:32:45.200 --> 02:32:47.200]  of survival shield nascent iodine

[02:33:15.200 --> 02:33:17.200]  it's Alex Jones
[02:33:17.200 --> 02:33:19.200]  coming to you live
[02:33:19.200 --> 02:33:21.200]  from the front lines of the info war
[02:33:29.200 --> 02:33:31.200]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show
[02:33:31.200 --> 02:33:33.200]  I'm David Knight and Austin joining us now
[02:33:33.200 --> 02:33:35.200]  is Paul Joseph Watson from the UK
[02:33:35.200 --> 02:33:37.200]  he had an article that was on Drudge
[02:33:37.200 --> 02:33:39.200]  earlier today liberals sign a petition
[02:33:39.200 --> 02:33:41.200]  to impose a 10% male privilege tax
[02:33:41.200 --> 02:33:43.200]  just before we went to break
[02:33:43.200 --> 02:33:45.200]  we played the video that was embedded
[02:33:45.200 --> 02:33:47.200]  there that was the mark dice again
[02:33:47.200 --> 02:33:49.200]  going into California trying to get
[02:33:49.200 --> 02:33:51.200]  people to sign a petition
[02:33:51.200 --> 02:33:53.200]  that is absolutely insane
[02:33:53.200 --> 02:33:55.200]  and having no problem whatsoever
[02:33:55.200 --> 02:33:57.200]  in getting them to do it
[02:33:57.200 --> 02:33:59.200]  Paul Joseph Watson wrote an article wrapped around
[02:33:59.200 --> 02:34:01.200]  that talking about
[02:34:01.200 --> 02:34:03.200]  the myth of gender
[02:34:03.200 --> 02:34:05.200]  pay gap so joining us now is
[02:34:05.200 --> 02:34:07.200]  Paul Joseph Watson welcome Paul
[02:34:07.200 --> 02:34:09.200]  Hi David, good to be back
[02:34:09.200 --> 02:34:11.200]  Now this article
[02:34:11.200 --> 02:34:13.200]  we had we were just watching part of that video
[02:34:13.200 --> 02:34:15.200]  we'll play some more of that for people in just a moment
[02:34:15.200 --> 02:34:17.200]  but talk for a moment about the
[02:34:17.200 --> 02:34:19.200]  myth of gender pay gap
[02:34:19.200 --> 02:34:21.200]  well yeah this is one of those
[02:34:21.200 --> 02:34:23.200]  feminist sacred cows that we hear
[02:34:23.200 --> 02:34:25.200]  over and over again
[02:34:25.200 --> 02:34:27.200]  but it's been completely debunked
[02:34:27.200 --> 02:34:29.200]  in fact there's a video
[02:34:29.200 --> 02:34:31.200]  by Christina Hoffsum as in that
[02:34:31.200 --> 02:34:33.200]  article on info wars
[02:34:33.200 --> 02:34:35.200]  and she's a dissident feminist
[02:34:35.200 --> 02:34:37.200]  she's an actual first wave feminist
[02:34:37.200 --> 02:34:39.200]  all the radicals basically hate her
[02:34:39.200 --> 02:34:41.200]  because she's very reasonable
[02:34:41.200 --> 02:34:43.200]  in her
[02:34:43.200 --> 02:34:45.200]  in her work and she's done some great
[02:34:45.200 --> 02:34:47.200]  analysis of this which is
[02:34:47.200 --> 02:34:49.200]  the fact that this gender
[02:34:49.200 --> 02:34:51.200]  pay gap which they claim
[02:34:51.200 --> 02:34:53.200]  runs from anything from 17 to 23%
[02:34:53.200 --> 02:34:55.200]  of income
[02:34:55.200 --> 02:34:57.200]  disappears almost
[02:34:57.200 --> 02:34:59.200]  disappears when you factor in
[02:34:59.200 --> 02:35:01.200]  the choices of jobs
[02:35:01.200 --> 02:35:03.200]  the jobs that men make and the fact that
[02:35:03.200 --> 02:35:05.200]  they work longer hours
[02:35:05.200 --> 02:35:07.200]  so once these factors and others
[02:35:07.200 --> 02:35:09.200]  are actually brought into
[02:35:09.200 --> 02:35:11.200]  consideration that gender
[02:35:11.200 --> 02:35:13.200]  wage gap completely disappears
[02:35:13.200 --> 02:35:15.200]  so again they've been flouting
[02:35:15.200 --> 02:35:17.200]  these fraudulent statistics about it
[02:35:17.200 --> 02:35:19.200]  for years similar to the
[02:35:19.200 --> 02:35:21.200]  one in five or one in four
[02:35:21.200 --> 02:35:23.200]  college women are raped on
[02:35:23.200 --> 02:35:25.200]  campus again completely debunked
[02:35:25.200 --> 02:35:27.200]  but these myths perpetuate
[02:35:27.200 --> 02:35:29.200]  because of the leftist
[02:35:29.200 --> 02:35:31.200]  media so of course you played
[02:35:31.200 --> 02:35:33.200]  the video mark dice goes out as long
[02:35:33.200 --> 02:35:35.200]  as he says the words you know racist
[02:35:35.200 --> 02:35:37.200]  or sexist and acts
[02:35:37.200 --> 02:35:39.200]  as an authoritarian figure
[02:35:39.200 --> 02:35:41.200]  they sign away the petition
[02:35:41.200 --> 02:35:43.200]  even though in fact on that video
[02:35:43.200 --> 02:35:45.200]  there are people in the background
[02:35:45.200 --> 02:35:47.200]  women in the background saying
[02:35:47.200 --> 02:35:49.200]  you know I earn more than my husband
[02:35:49.200 --> 02:35:51.200]  what's wrong with that it's down to
[02:35:51.200 --> 02:35:53.200]  what jobs you choose to do
[02:35:53.200 --> 02:35:55.200]  which is exactly the case so again
[02:35:55.200 --> 02:35:57.200]  it strikes at the heart of how they
[02:35:57.200 --> 02:35:59.200]  they will believe
[02:35:59.200 --> 02:36:01.200]  these statistics with no
[02:36:01.200 --> 02:36:03.200]  consideration no investigation
[02:36:03.200 --> 02:36:05.200]  whatsoever and then claim
[02:36:05.200 --> 02:36:07.200]  that it represents male privilege
[02:36:07.200 --> 02:36:09.200]  does the fact that
[02:36:09.200 --> 02:36:11.200]  93% of
[02:36:11.200 --> 02:36:13.200]  workplace deaths being men
[02:36:13.200 --> 02:36:15.200]  does that represent male privilege
[02:36:15.200 --> 02:36:17.200]  does the fact that 94%
[02:36:17.200 --> 02:36:19.200]  of workplace suicides
[02:36:19.200 --> 02:36:21.200]  every year are men
[02:36:21.200 --> 02:36:23.200]  also represent male
[02:36:23.200 --> 02:36:25.200]  privilege again
[02:36:25.200 --> 02:36:27.200]  you have these women going into university
[02:36:27.200 --> 02:36:29.200]  doing gender studies classes
[02:36:29.200 --> 02:36:31.200]  they're not doing the STEM subjects
[02:36:31.200 --> 02:36:33.200]  they're not doing science
[02:36:33.200 --> 02:36:35.200]  they're not doing engineering
[02:36:35.200 --> 02:36:37.200]  and then feminist whine about the fact
[02:36:37.200 --> 02:36:39.200]  that men are paid more well yeah
[02:36:39.200 --> 02:36:41.200]  they're doing different higher paid jobs
[02:36:41.200 --> 02:36:43.200]  and they're working for longer hours
[02:36:43.200 --> 02:36:45.200]  so of course they're going to be paid more
[02:36:45.200 --> 02:36:47.200]  it has nothing to do with the evil
[02:36:47.200 --> 02:36:49.200]  patriarchy oppressing women
[02:36:49.200 --> 02:36:51.200]  absolutely it's using statistics
[02:36:51.200 --> 02:36:53.200]  in a way to get the desired
[02:36:53.200 --> 02:36:55.200]  outcome we see that happening
[02:36:55.200 --> 02:36:57.200]  all the time with people
[02:36:57.200 --> 02:36:59.200]  I think there's also an aspect of it Paul
[02:36:59.200 --> 02:37:01.200]  you've got a group of people
[02:37:01.200 --> 02:37:03.200]  it's so easy
[02:37:03.200 --> 02:37:05.200]  to raise taxes when you come to one
[02:37:05.200 --> 02:37:07.200]  group and you say I'm going to raise
[02:37:07.200 --> 02:37:09.200]  taxes on the other guy will you vote for that
[02:37:09.200 --> 02:37:11.200]  that's a large part of what this is about
[02:37:11.200 --> 02:37:13.200]  as I'm watching these women sign that petition
[02:37:13.200 --> 02:37:15.200]  they're saying oh yeah
[02:37:15.200 --> 02:37:17.200]  raise taxes on the other guy
[02:37:17.200 --> 02:37:19.200]  I'm all for that because I'm not a guy
[02:37:19.200 --> 02:37:21.200]  so they sign up for that right away
[02:37:21.200 --> 02:37:23.200]  it's like when
[02:37:23.200 --> 02:37:25.200]  people have gone to Walmart
[02:37:25.200 --> 02:37:27.200]  and petitioned for
[02:37:27.200 --> 02:37:29.200]  wages at 15%
[02:37:29.200 --> 02:37:31.200]  hike or whatever $15
[02:37:31.200 --> 02:37:33.200]  and then they say oh by the way
[02:37:33.200 --> 02:37:35.200]  do you want to pay double for that
[02:37:35.200 --> 02:37:37.200]  discount television that you just purchased
[02:37:37.200 --> 02:37:39.200]  and they say well no
[02:37:39.200 --> 02:37:41.200]  as long as it doesn't affect them they're all
[02:37:41.200 --> 02:37:43.200]  for it but of course everything related
[02:37:43.200 --> 02:37:45.200]  to that eventually will affect them
[02:37:45.200 --> 02:37:47.200]  and they don't realize that
[02:37:47.200 --> 02:37:49.200]  at the time but there's also
[02:37:49.200 --> 02:37:51.200]  another piece that I posted on
[02:37:51.200 --> 02:37:53.200]  info was about an hour ago which is
[02:37:53.200 --> 02:37:55.200]  again completely ridiculous
[02:37:55.200 --> 02:37:57.200]  as you would expect from feminist
[02:37:57.200 --> 02:37:59.200]  but this is a Washington post columnist
[02:37:59.200 --> 02:38:01.200]  saying this and again
[02:38:01.200 --> 02:38:03.200]  I get this over and over again
[02:38:03.200 --> 02:38:05.200]  where people say you know
[02:38:05.200 --> 02:38:07.200]  why are you talking about these
[02:38:07.200 --> 02:38:09.200]  insane ideas and proposals that
[02:38:09.200 --> 02:38:11.200]  feminists come up with they've got no power
[02:38:11.200 --> 02:38:13.200]  they've got no influence they're just
[02:38:13.200 --> 02:38:15.200]  ranting on their little tumblr
[02:38:15.200 --> 02:38:17.200]  blogs nobody's paying attention
[02:38:17.200 --> 02:38:19.200]  well now that's not the case
[02:38:19.200 --> 02:38:21.200]  a lot of these articles
[02:38:21.200 --> 02:38:23.200]  are in major publications of course
[02:38:23.200 --> 02:38:25.200]  last week we had the
[02:38:25.200 --> 02:38:27.200]  the man who felt
[02:38:27.200 --> 02:38:29.200]  guilty about the fact that he wasn't letting his wife
[02:38:29.200 --> 02:38:31.200]  sleep with other men because
[02:38:31.200 --> 02:38:33.200]  he was a feminist his wife with whom
[02:38:33.200 --> 02:38:35.200]  he had two small children
[02:38:35.200 --> 02:38:37.200]  that was in nymag.com
[02:38:37.200 --> 02:38:39.200]  again another major publication
[02:38:39.200 --> 02:38:41.200]  you had the guy in Slate
[02:38:41.200 --> 02:38:43.200]  another feminist writing
[02:38:43.200 --> 02:38:45.200]  in a big leftist publication
[02:38:45.200 --> 02:38:47.200]  that barbecues were
[02:38:47.200 --> 02:38:49.200]  inherently sexist because
[02:38:49.200 --> 02:38:51.200]  they reinforced traditional
[02:38:51.200 --> 02:38:53.200]  gender roles and were inherently
[02:38:53.200 --> 02:38:55.200]  misogynistic again
[02:38:55.200 --> 02:38:57.200]  complete lunacy but it's
[02:38:57.200 --> 02:38:59.200]  being published in a major
[02:38:59.200 --> 02:39:01.200]  news outlet which is part of this
[02:39:01.200 --> 02:39:03.200]  process which people have called
[02:39:03.200 --> 02:39:05.200]  the mainstreaming of lunacy
[02:39:05.200 --> 02:39:07.200]  and you know if it's not consistently
[02:39:07.200 --> 02:39:09.200]  challenged then that kind of warped
[02:39:09.200 --> 02:39:11.200]  thinking becomes the norm
[02:39:11.200 --> 02:39:13.200]  we've seen it with the whole
[02:39:13.200 --> 02:39:15.200]  Caitlyn Jenner fiasco of course
[02:39:15.200 --> 02:39:17.200]  that was sold
[02:39:17.200 --> 02:39:19.200]  as this big transgender rights issue
[02:39:19.200 --> 02:39:21.200]  where Caitlyn Jenner
[02:39:21.200 --> 02:39:23.200]  got this courage award at the
[02:39:23.200 --> 02:39:25.200]  ESPN event
[02:39:25.200 --> 02:39:27.200]  again it's come out today that
[02:39:27.200 --> 02:39:29.200]  that was a cynical
[02:39:29.200 --> 02:39:31.200]  negotiation between Caitlyn
[02:39:31.200 --> 02:39:33.200]  Jenner's people and ESPN
[02:39:33.200 --> 02:39:35.200]  they said if you give us
[02:39:35.200 --> 02:39:37.200]  the award we will give you free
[02:39:37.200 --> 02:39:39.200]  plugs on Caitlyn
[02:39:39.200 --> 02:39:41.200]  Jenner's TV show
[02:39:41.200 --> 02:39:43.200]  and Jenner in fact threatened to pull out
[02:39:43.200 --> 02:39:45.200]  of the ABC 2020
[02:39:45.200 --> 02:39:47.200]  interview if he
[02:39:47.200 --> 02:39:49.200]  she whatever you want to call it
[02:39:49.200 --> 02:39:51.200]  wasn't given that award so again
[02:39:51.200 --> 02:39:53.200]  another public relations
[02:39:53.200 --> 02:39:55.200]  done based around money
[02:39:55.200 --> 02:39:57.200]  and yet it was sold as this huge
[02:39:57.200 --> 02:39:59.200]  you know LGBT
[02:39:59.200 --> 02:40:01.200]  rights issue when it was
[02:40:01.200 --> 02:40:03.200]  a completely cynical hoax
[02:40:03.200 --> 02:40:05.200]  so we've got another article on
[02:40:05.200 --> 02:40:07.200]  info wars right now which is
[02:40:07.200 --> 02:40:09.200]  Washington post columnist
[02:40:09.200 --> 02:40:11.200]  air conditioning is sexist
[02:40:11.200 --> 02:40:13.200]  again
[02:40:13.200 --> 02:40:15.200]  this is not out of the onion this is a serious
[02:40:15.200 --> 02:40:17.200]  article where this
[02:40:17.200 --> 02:40:19.200]  Washington post columnist particular
[02:40:19.200 --> 02:40:21.200]  vorac says that
[02:40:21.200 --> 02:40:23.200]  because women tend to wear
[02:40:23.200 --> 02:40:25.200]  less clothes in summer and of course
[02:40:25.200 --> 02:40:27.200]  the AC is turned up
[02:40:27.200 --> 02:40:29.200]  they're freezing to death in the office
[02:40:29.200 --> 02:40:31.200]  whereas men who wear full
[02:40:31.200 --> 02:40:33.200]  suits are fine and she's
[02:40:33.200 --> 02:40:35.200]  saying that that is quote another
[02:40:35.200 --> 02:40:37.200]  big sexist
[02:40:37.200 --> 02:40:39.200]  plot on behalf of the
[02:40:39.200 --> 02:40:41.200]  evil patriarchy
[02:40:41.200 --> 02:40:43.200]  again it's not due to the fact that
[02:40:43.200 --> 02:40:45.200]  if you wear more clothes
[02:40:45.200 --> 02:40:47.200]  you will tend to be warmer
[02:40:47.200 --> 02:40:49.200]  it's again it's a huge
[02:40:49.200 --> 02:40:51.200]  sexist conspiracy so
[02:40:51.200 --> 02:40:53.200]  again it's the mainstreaming
[02:40:53.200 --> 02:40:55.200]  of lunacy this is becoming
[02:40:55.200 --> 02:40:57.200]  the norm now maybe she's being
[02:40:57.200 --> 02:40:59.200]  sexist for saying women are wearing less clothing
[02:40:59.200 --> 02:41:01.200]  maybe is she implying that women are
[02:41:01.200 --> 02:41:03.200]  using less clothing
[02:41:03.200 --> 02:41:05.200]  for a reason in the workplace it's
[02:41:05.200 --> 02:41:07.200]  absolutely insane Paul because
[02:41:07.200 --> 02:41:09.200]  we see them using the labels
[02:41:09.200 --> 02:41:11.200]  sexist or racist
[02:41:11.200 --> 02:41:13.200]  to make it
[02:41:13.200 --> 02:41:15.200]  for any cause that they want to promote
[02:41:15.200 --> 02:41:17.200]  you know you're talking about barbecue grilling
[02:41:17.200 --> 02:41:19.200]  now you're talking about air conditioning
[02:41:19.200 --> 02:41:21.200]  let's understand that there is an agenda
[02:41:21.200 --> 02:41:23.200]  here that is trying to demonize
[02:41:23.200 --> 02:41:25.200]  various things
[02:41:25.200 --> 02:41:27.200]  that we have in modern society
[02:41:27.200 --> 02:41:29.200]  for the sake of creating
[02:41:29.200 --> 02:41:31.200]  some kind of a global
[02:41:31.200 --> 02:41:33.200]  carbon tax
[02:41:33.200 --> 02:41:35.200]  that's going to go to a few carbon
[02:41:35.200 --> 02:41:37.200]  billionaires like Al Gore that's what's
[02:41:37.200 --> 02:41:39.200]  really behind this agenda and they try
[02:41:39.200 --> 02:41:41.200]  to paint this as a high moral
[02:41:41.200 --> 02:41:43.200]  cause just as we saw with the pope
[02:41:43.200 --> 02:41:45.200]  embracing this even
[02:41:45.200 --> 02:41:47.200]  bringing into his
[02:41:47.200 --> 02:41:49.200]  Vatican scientific advisory council
[02:41:49.200 --> 02:41:51.200]  a guy who is a radical
[02:41:51.200 --> 02:41:53.200]  depopulationist
[02:41:53.200 --> 02:41:55.200]  that's the thing that they're most concerned about
[02:41:55.200 --> 02:41:57.200]  and they take the moral high ground
[02:41:57.200 --> 02:41:59.200]  by labeling everything as sexist
[02:41:59.200 --> 02:42:01.200]  or racist but it's backfiring on them
[02:42:01.200 --> 02:42:03.200]  because people are seeing through the absurdity of it
[02:42:03.200 --> 02:42:05.200]  well yeah and that's
[02:42:05.200 --> 02:42:07.200]  that's how they got into this position
[02:42:07.200 --> 02:42:09.200]  in the first place you know in decades past
[02:42:09.200 --> 02:42:11.200]  even if you disagree with them
[02:42:11.200 --> 02:42:13.200]  you know for example a fiscally
[02:42:13.200 --> 02:42:15.200]  conservative level leftists
[02:42:15.200 --> 02:42:17.200]  would still be able to at least pose
[02:42:17.200 --> 02:42:19.200]  as if they were taking the moral high ground
[02:42:19.200 --> 02:42:21.200]  which gave them this kind
[02:42:21.200 --> 02:42:23.200]  of credence when it
[02:42:23.200 --> 02:42:25.200]  came to making these compassionate
[02:42:25.200 --> 02:42:27.200]  arguments about how societies
[02:42:27.200 --> 02:42:29.200]  should run and how we should look after
[02:42:29.200 --> 02:42:31.200]  the less fortunate members of society
[02:42:31.200 --> 02:42:33.200]  but now in
[02:42:33.200 --> 02:42:35.200]  2015 they've abused
[02:42:35.200 --> 02:42:37.200]  that moral high ground to such an extent
[02:42:37.200 --> 02:42:39.200]  that again it's becoming
[02:42:39.200 --> 02:42:41.200]  the mainstreaming of lunacy
[02:42:41.200 --> 02:42:43.200]  and scratch beneath the surface
[02:42:43.200 --> 02:42:45.200]  just a little for example this
[02:42:45.200 --> 02:42:47.200]  you know air conditioning is sexist
[02:42:47.200 --> 02:42:49.200]  if this was part of a huge patriarchal
[02:42:49.200 --> 02:42:51.200]  conspiracy
[02:42:51.200 --> 02:42:53.200]  then wouldn't men want to
[02:42:53.200 --> 02:42:55.200]  make women wear less clothes
[02:42:55.200 --> 02:42:57.200]  in the office
[02:42:57.200 --> 02:42:59.200]  if they were sexist
[02:42:59.200 --> 02:43:01.200]  of course they would have the air conditioning low
[02:43:01.200 --> 02:43:03.200]  it would be really warm it would be hot in the office
[02:43:03.200 --> 02:43:05.200]  women would wear less clothes
[02:43:05.200 --> 02:43:07.200]  that would obviously appeal
[02:43:07.200 --> 02:43:09.200]  to the inherently misogynistic
[02:43:09.200 --> 02:43:11.200]  man right but no of course it makes
[02:43:11.200 --> 02:43:13.200]  no sense whatsoever
[02:43:13.200 --> 02:43:15.200]  when you analyze it for two minutes
[02:43:15.200 --> 02:43:17.200]  but logic is not the strong
[02:43:17.200 --> 02:43:19.200]  point of radical feminists
[02:43:19.200 --> 02:43:21.200]  that's true now you know that first
[02:43:21.200 --> 02:43:23.200]  report we're talking about
[02:43:23.200 --> 02:43:25.200]  that Mark Dice had where they're talking about
[02:43:25.200 --> 02:43:27.200]  let's raise the taxes on guys
[02:43:27.200 --> 02:43:29.200]  because I'm not a guy
[02:43:29.200 --> 02:43:31.200]  there was another
[02:43:31.200 --> 02:43:33.200]  issue that you wanted to talk about of course
[02:43:33.200 --> 02:43:35.200]  and that was killer robots
[02:43:35.200 --> 02:43:37.200]  and we've just had some information
[02:43:37.200 --> 02:43:39.200]  a lot of things have developed in the last week
[02:43:39.200 --> 02:43:41.200]  I was going to talk about this throughout the show today
[02:43:41.200 --> 02:43:43.200]  I'll probably get back to it tomorrow
[02:43:43.200 --> 02:43:45.200]  a lot of things in terms of genetic modification
[02:43:45.200 --> 02:43:47.200]  there was a report that came out
[02:43:47.200 --> 02:43:49.200]  from the Pentagon visualizing
[02:43:49.200 --> 02:43:51.200]  the tactical battle
[02:43:51.200 --> 02:43:53.200]  field in the year 2050
[02:43:53.200 --> 02:43:55.200]  they're looking at genetically modified humans
[02:43:55.200 --> 02:43:57.200]  people with implants
[02:43:57.200 --> 02:43:59.200]  people they call superhumans
[02:43:59.200 --> 02:44:01.200]  that is very troubling but the other aspect of it
[02:44:01.200 --> 02:44:03.200]  that is very very troubling
[02:44:03.200 --> 02:44:05.200]  is the degree of autonomy
[02:44:05.200 --> 02:44:07.200]  that they're going to give to drones
[02:44:07.200 --> 02:44:09.200]  to robots
[02:44:09.200 --> 02:44:11.200]  on the ground that is very
[02:44:11.200 --> 02:44:13.200]  disturbing and of course they see that
[02:44:13.200 --> 02:44:15.200]  as a given trend
[02:44:15.200 --> 02:44:17.200]  because they say people simply aren't going to be able
[02:44:17.200 --> 02:44:19.200]  to react quickly enough
[02:44:19.200 --> 02:44:21.200]  people are getting accustomed to
[02:44:21.200 --> 02:44:23.200]  automated robots everywhere
[02:44:23.200 --> 02:44:25.200]  they're going to become more and more accustomed to this
[02:44:25.200 --> 02:44:27.200]  they're going to accept it
[02:44:27.200 --> 02:44:29.200]  and they see as one of the key dangers
[02:44:29.200 --> 02:44:31.200]  confronting us
[02:44:31.200 --> 02:44:33.200]  there's many things that are coming up
[02:44:33.200 --> 02:44:35.200]  out of the military industrial complex
[02:44:35.200 --> 02:44:37.200]  owning research
[02:44:37.200 --> 02:44:39.200]  owning science
[02:44:39.200 --> 02:44:41.200]  and they are coming up with one technology
[02:44:41.200 --> 02:44:43.200]  after the other that has the capability
[02:44:43.200 --> 02:44:45.200]  of inflicting gigadeath
[02:44:45.200 --> 02:44:47.200]  on the human population
[02:44:47.200 --> 02:44:49.200]  but of course one of these is killer robots
[02:44:49.200 --> 02:44:51.200]  talk about what's happening in the UK
[02:44:51.200 --> 02:44:53.200]  in response to killer robots
[02:44:53.200 --> 02:44:55.200]  yeah and again
[02:44:55.200 --> 02:44:57.200]  real issue
[02:44:57.200 --> 02:44:59.200]  real threat to humanity that gets lost
[02:44:59.200 --> 02:45:01.200]  and buried amongst all this fluff
[02:45:01.200 --> 02:45:03.200]  about you know Caitlyn general
[02:45:03.200 --> 02:45:05.200]  Bill Cosby or whatever
[02:45:05.200 --> 02:45:07.200]  and it's the fact that today
[02:45:07.200 --> 02:45:09.200]  these experts, thousands of scientists
[02:45:09.200 --> 02:45:11.200]  have signed a letter
[02:45:11.200 --> 02:45:13.200]  again calling for a ban
[02:45:13.200 --> 02:45:15.200]  on autonomous killer robots
[02:45:15.200 --> 02:45:17.200]  including Professor Stephen Hawking
[02:45:17.200 --> 02:45:19.200]  because they say
[02:45:19.200 --> 02:45:21.200]  that one day they could be used to
[02:45:21.200 --> 02:45:23.200]  carry out mechanized mass slaughter
[02:45:23.200 --> 02:45:25.200]  and even ethnic cleansing campaigns
[02:45:25.200 --> 02:45:27.200]  if the technology
[02:45:27.200 --> 02:45:29.200]  you know
[02:45:29.200 --> 02:45:31.200]  is abused by dictators and terrorists
[02:45:31.200 --> 02:45:33.200]  what they don't mention is
[02:45:33.200 --> 02:45:35.200]  what we've talked about for years
[02:45:35.200 --> 02:45:37.200]  and in fact
[02:45:37.200 --> 02:45:39.200]  what the Pentagon talked about in a 2008 request
[02:45:39.200 --> 02:45:41.200]  for contractors
[02:45:41.200 --> 02:45:43.200]  where they call for the development of robots
[02:45:43.200 --> 02:45:45.200]  to search for and detect
[02:45:45.200 --> 02:45:47.200]  non-cooperative humans
[02:45:47.200 --> 02:45:49.200]  during pursuit and invasion scenarios
[02:45:49.200 --> 02:45:51.200]  so
[02:45:51.200 --> 02:45:53.200]  they're talking about using these robots
[02:45:53.200 --> 02:45:55.200]  which are being developed by Boston Dynamics
[02:45:55.200 --> 02:45:57.200]  now owned by Google
[02:45:57.200 --> 02:45:59.200]  of course for DARPA
[02:45:59.200 --> 02:46:01.200]  and the Pentagon
[02:46:01.200 --> 02:46:03.200]  those robots including the most recent ones
[02:46:03.200 --> 02:46:05.200]  they unveiled spot and before
[02:46:05.200 --> 02:46:07.200]  that big dog
[02:46:07.200 --> 02:46:09.200]  were based around pursuing
[02:46:09.200 --> 02:46:11.200]  humans in these
[02:46:11.200 --> 02:46:13.200]  evasion pursuit scenarios
[02:46:13.200 --> 02:46:15.200]  so now you fast forward that
[02:46:15.200 --> 02:46:17.200]  and consider the fact that the Pentagon
[02:46:17.200 --> 02:46:19.200]  now wants a quarter of its
[02:46:19.200 --> 02:46:21.200]  battlefield troops
[02:46:21.200 --> 02:46:23.200]  to be robots
[02:46:23.200 --> 02:46:25.200]  within the next 10-20 years
[02:46:25.200 --> 02:46:27.200]  and of course that becomes the major threat
[02:46:27.200 --> 02:46:29.200]  our own governments using this
[02:46:29.200 --> 02:46:31.200]  on a grand mechanized scale
[02:46:31.200 --> 02:46:33.200]  and that process getting out of hand
[02:46:33.200 --> 02:46:35.200]  because of the ethical considerations
[02:46:35.200 --> 02:46:37.200]  tied to robots
[02:46:37.200 --> 02:46:39.200]  who of course are more likely to kill
[02:46:39.200 --> 02:46:41.200]  less likely to hesitate
[02:46:41.200 --> 02:46:43.200]  when it comes to
[02:46:43.200 --> 02:46:45.200]  killing large numbers of people
[02:46:45.200 --> 02:46:47.200]  and as I was going to talk
[02:46:47.200 --> 02:46:49.200]  about how I can make that correlation
[02:46:49.200 --> 02:46:51.200]  people are always in favor of raising taxes
[02:46:51.200 --> 02:46:53.200]  on other
[02:46:53.200 --> 02:46:55.200]  they're also in favor of
[02:46:55.200 --> 02:46:57.200]  using preemptive strikes on other groups
[02:46:57.200 --> 02:46:59.200]  and when we look at the push
[02:46:59.200 --> 02:47:01.200]  that has just come out in the last couple of weeks
[02:47:01.200 --> 02:47:03.200]  from Mike McCall where he wants to create
[02:47:03.200 --> 02:47:05.200]  a violent extremism department
[02:47:05.200 --> 02:47:07.200]  within Homeland Security
[02:47:07.200 --> 02:47:09.200]  putting it under FEMA
[02:47:09.200 --> 02:47:11.200]  at the same time we see Wesley Clark saying
[02:47:11.200 --> 02:47:13.200]  people can express their disloyalty
[02:47:13.200 --> 02:47:15.200]  to the United States
[02:47:15.200 --> 02:47:17.200]  we have a right to segregate those people
[02:47:17.200 --> 02:47:19.200]  for the duration
[02:47:19.200 --> 02:47:21.200]  of the conflict meaning the war on terror
[02:47:21.200 --> 02:47:23.200]  which will never go away because there's
[02:47:23.200 --> 02:47:25.200]  no defined enemies
[02:47:25.200 --> 02:47:27.200]  but everybody seems to think
[02:47:27.200 --> 02:47:29.200]  that this is going to be the other guy
[02:47:29.200 --> 02:47:31.200]  this is something for the foreigner
[02:47:31.200 --> 02:47:33.200]  something for the Islamic jihadists
[02:47:33.200 --> 02:47:35.200]  but we can see with the shooting that happened
[02:47:35.200 --> 02:47:37.200]  last week we can see with the scenarios
[02:47:37.200 --> 02:47:39.200]  over and over again
[02:47:39.200 --> 02:47:41.200]  that that's not what they're looking for
[02:47:41.200 --> 02:47:43.200]  as a matter of fact in response to Mike McCall's bill
[02:47:43.200 --> 02:47:45.200]  I just covered it yesterday
[02:47:45.200 --> 02:47:47.200]  one of the people who was analyzing it said
[02:47:47.200 --> 02:47:49.200]  yeah in order for this to work we need to understand
[02:47:49.200 --> 02:47:51.200]  that we've been focusing too narrowly
[02:47:51.200 --> 02:47:53.200]  on Muslims they're not the real problem
[02:47:53.200 --> 02:47:55.200]  they're not the real problem with
[02:47:55.200 --> 02:47:57.200]  homegrown violent extremism
[02:47:57.200 --> 02:47:59.200]  it's all these other people who don't
[02:47:59.200 --> 02:48:01.200]  like the government and so that's where this stuff
[02:48:01.200 --> 02:48:03.200]  is essentially going to be leading
[02:48:03.200 --> 02:48:05.200]  Paul
[02:48:05.200 --> 02:48:07.200]  well that's right and we've had reports where
[02:48:07.200 --> 02:48:09.200]  Homeland Security is
[02:48:09.200 --> 02:48:11.200]  given Muslim Brotherhood terrorists
[02:48:11.200 --> 02:48:13.200]  the red carpet when they're traveling
[02:48:13.200 --> 02:48:15.200]  through US airports
[02:48:15.200 --> 02:48:17.200]  they consistently elevate the threat
[02:48:17.200 --> 02:48:19.200]  of homegrown extremists
[02:48:19.200 --> 02:48:21.200]  above that of radical
[02:48:21.200 --> 02:48:23.200]  terrorists so of course we're creating
[02:48:23.200 --> 02:48:25.200]  through our foreign policy
[02:48:25.200 --> 02:48:27.200]  in fact today it was revealed that
[02:48:27.200 --> 02:48:29.200]  Obama gave Turkey the green light
[02:48:29.200 --> 02:48:31.200]  to bomb the Kurds
[02:48:31.200 --> 02:48:33.200]  who are actually fighting
[02:48:33.200 --> 02:48:35.200]  ISIS in Iraq
[02:48:35.200 --> 02:48:37.200]  and Syria so again
[02:48:37.200 --> 02:48:39.200]  the growth of ISIS continues
[02:48:39.200 --> 02:48:41.200]  we've got these bizarre weapons drops
[02:48:41.200 --> 02:48:43.200]  that keep happening and yet they say
[02:48:43.200 --> 02:48:45.200]  that the biggest threat is homegrown terrorism
[02:48:45.200 --> 02:48:47.200]  and you tie that back again to this
[02:48:47.200 --> 02:48:49.200]  development of killer robots in fact
[02:48:49.200 --> 02:48:51.200]  I quoted in the article
[02:48:51.200 --> 02:48:53.200]  the new scientist Paul Marx
[02:48:53.200 --> 02:48:55.200]  who responded to the
[02:48:55.200 --> 02:48:57.200]  Pentagon request for contractors to build
[02:48:57.200 --> 02:48:59.200]  these search and detect robots by saying
[02:48:59.200 --> 02:49:01.200]  how long before we see
[02:49:01.200 --> 02:49:03.200]  packs of droids hunting down
[02:49:03.200 --> 02:49:05.200]  pesky demonstrators with paralyzing
[02:49:05.200 --> 02:49:07.200]  weapons or could
[02:49:07.200 --> 02:49:09.200]  the packs even be lethally armed
[02:49:09.200 --> 02:49:11.200]  so you've got
[02:49:11.200 --> 02:49:13.200]  these drones already armed with tasers
[02:49:13.200 --> 02:49:15.200]  that police departments across
[02:49:15.200 --> 02:49:17.200]  the country are considering using
[02:49:17.200 --> 02:49:19.200]  you've got the federal government identifying
[02:49:19.200 --> 02:49:21.200]  homegrown extremists as the terror threat
[02:49:21.200 --> 02:49:23.200]  and you've got the convergence
[02:49:23.200 --> 02:49:25.200]  of this technology where these
[02:49:25.200 --> 02:49:27.200]  hunting robots will be used to
[02:49:27.200 --> 02:49:29.200]  corral potentially
[02:49:29.200 --> 02:49:31.200]  dissidents and demonstrators
[02:49:31.200 --> 02:49:33.200]  over the next 5, 10, 15 years
[02:49:33.200 --> 02:49:35.200]  so that's the biggest threat
[02:49:35.200 --> 02:49:37.200]  as I see it, yes
[02:49:37.200 --> 02:49:39.200]  from terrorists and dictators but mainly
[02:49:39.200 --> 02:49:41.200]  from our own government because that's where
[02:49:41.200 --> 02:49:43.200]  all this technology is coming from
[02:49:43.200 --> 02:49:45.200]  It's very frightening and there seems to be
[02:49:45.200 --> 02:49:47.200]  no awareness of the public
[02:49:47.200 --> 02:49:49.200]  as to where this is all heading
[02:49:49.200 --> 02:49:51.200]  I mean people need to go back
[02:49:51.200 --> 02:49:53.200]  and look at the fundamental premise
[02:49:53.200 --> 02:49:55.200]  of Jurassic Park for example
[02:49:55.200 --> 02:49:57.200]  it's very clear when you read the novel
[02:49:57.200 --> 02:49:59.200]  it's even clear in the movie
[02:49:59.200 --> 02:50:01.200]  the movie with screenplay was written by
[02:50:01.200 --> 02:50:03.200]  the author of the book Michael Crichton
[02:50:03.200 --> 02:50:05.200]  it's very clear that people don't
[02:50:05.200 --> 02:50:07.200]  see the bigger problem this is
[02:50:07.200 --> 02:50:09.200]  particularly true of the engineers
[02:50:09.200 --> 02:50:11.200]  and scientists who are looking at this
[02:50:11.200 --> 02:50:13.200]  they don't have a big picture
[02:50:13.200 --> 02:50:15.200]  view they aren't concerned
[02:50:15.200 --> 02:50:17.200]  about what's the
[02:50:17.200 --> 02:50:19.200]  consequences for all of society
[02:50:19.200 --> 02:50:21.200]  or how this is going to be used by a small
[02:50:21.200 --> 02:50:23.200]  number of people you're talking about swarms
[02:50:23.200 --> 02:50:25.200]  of robots Paul being used against protesters
[02:50:25.200 --> 02:50:27.200]  that's one of the key things when they
[02:50:27.200 --> 02:50:29.200]  visualize the battlefield in the year
[02:50:29.200 --> 02:50:31.200]  2050 they're talking about swarms
[02:50:31.200 --> 02:50:33.200]  of robots and they're talking about how
[02:50:33.200 --> 02:50:35.200]  virtually the entire battle
[02:50:35.200 --> 02:50:37.200]  will be done by autonomous
[02:50:37.200 --> 02:50:39.200]  killing machines as well
[02:50:39.200 --> 02:50:41.200]  as robots that are controlled
[02:50:41.200 --> 02:50:43.200]  by super humans
[02:50:43.200 --> 02:50:45.200]  that have been genetically modified
[02:50:45.200 --> 02:50:47.200]  that are directly connected to these robots
[02:50:47.200 --> 02:50:49.200]  a small number of people
[02:50:49.200 --> 02:50:51.200]  a small praetorian guard
[02:50:51.200 --> 02:50:53.200]  a very frightening possibility
[02:50:53.200 --> 02:50:55.200]  stay with us we'll be right back to talk to
[02:50:55.200 --> 02:50:57.200]  Paul Joseph Watson from the UK

[02:54:07.200 --> 02:54:09.200]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show
[02:54:09.200 --> 02:54:11.200]  I'm David Knight in Austin joining us from the UK
[02:54:11.200 --> 02:54:13.200]  as Paul Joseph Watson
[02:54:13.200 --> 02:54:15.200]  now the founders of this country
[02:54:15.200 --> 02:54:17.200]  understood the dangers of a standing army
[02:54:17.200 --> 02:54:19.200]  Madison specifically warned us that the
[02:54:19.200 --> 02:54:21.200]  blood would become
[02:54:21.200 --> 02:54:23.200]  instruments of tyranny at home
[02:54:23.200 --> 02:54:25.200]  Eisenhower warned us about the military industrial
[02:54:25.200 --> 02:54:27.200]  complex about the defense department
[02:54:27.200 --> 02:54:29.200]  making it a business
[02:54:29.200 --> 02:54:31.200]  taking over scientific research
[02:54:31.200 --> 02:54:33.200]  taking over the university's research
[02:54:33.200 --> 02:54:35.200]  more specifically now
[02:54:35.200 --> 02:54:37.200]  we are seeing specific
[02:54:37.200 --> 02:54:39.200]  technologies that many scientists have
[02:54:39.200 --> 02:54:41.200]  flagged as something that could
[02:54:41.200 --> 02:54:43.200]  cause massive death
[02:54:43.200 --> 02:54:45.200]  giga death as Hugo DeGaris
[02:54:45.200 --> 02:54:47.200]  talks about it we had him on interviewing
[02:54:47.200 --> 02:54:49.200]  him about the dangers inherent
[02:54:49.200 --> 02:54:51.200]  in general artificial intelligence
[02:54:51.200 --> 02:54:53.200]  but of course specific artificial
[02:54:53.200 --> 02:54:55.200]  intelligence in terms of killer robots
[02:54:55.200 --> 02:54:57.200]  with something else that he was very concerned about
[02:54:57.200 --> 02:54:59.200]  we've talked to Noel Sharkey about
[02:54:59.200 --> 02:55:01.200]  the organization that campaign
[02:55:01.200 --> 02:55:03.200]  to stop killer robots
[02:55:03.200 --> 02:55:05.200]  and as Stephen Hawkins has come out against
[02:55:05.200 --> 02:55:07.200]  that and we've just been talking to
[02:55:07.200 --> 02:55:09.200]  Paul Joseph Watson in the UK about
[02:55:09.200 --> 02:55:11.200]  how the UK
[02:55:11.200 --> 02:55:13.200]  is opposing a massive movement
[02:55:13.200 --> 02:55:15.200]  by scientists who do see
[02:55:15.200 --> 02:55:17.200]  the big picture who are concerned
[02:55:17.200 --> 02:55:19.200]  about this runaway technology and the
[02:55:19.200 --> 02:55:21.200]  consequences it could have but the UK
[02:55:21.200 --> 02:55:23.200]  is opposing it just like people here
[02:55:23.200 --> 02:55:25.200]  in the US the defense industry in the US
[02:55:25.200 --> 02:55:27.200]  because they are very closely linked
[02:55:27.200 --> 02:55:29.200]  we see Paul that
[02:55:29.200 --> 02:55:31.200]  of course the United States we have more than
[02:55:31.200 --> 02:55:33.200]  half of the worldwide defense spending in other words
[02:55:33.200 --> 02:55:35.200]  put it another way we spend more
[02:55:35.200 --> 02:55:37.200]  than all the rest of the countries
[02:55:37.200 --> 02:55:39.200]  combined and one of the things that pulls us into
[02:55:39.200 --> 02:55:41.200]  it is this fear
[02:55:41.200 --> 02:55:43.200]  that the other side whoever that other side
[02:55:43.200 --> 02:55:45.200]  may be in their scenario that the other side
[02:55:45.200 --> 02:55:47.200]  is going to get some technology
[02:55:47.200 --> 02:55:49.200]  and we're going to be at a
[02:55:49.200 --> 02:55:51.200]  loss of that so we have to get that technology
[02:55:51.200 --> 02:55:53.200]  that lethal technology before them so we create
[02:55:53.200 --> 02:55:55.200]  all these things like killer robots like
[02:55:55.200 --> 02:55:57.200]  so like biological agents
[02:55:57.200 --> 02:55:59.200]  with a gain of function to make them more deadly easier
[02:55:59.200 --> 02:56:01.200]  to catch I mean this is an insane
[02:56:01.200 --> 02:56:03.200]  race over the cliff Paul
[02:56:03.200 --> 02:56:05.200]  yeah and that's
[02:56:05.200 --> 02:56:07.200]  what they're warning about they're saying that this is going to
[02:56:07.200 --> 02:56:09.200]  create a killer robot arms race
[02:56:09.200 --> 02:56:11.200]  between the United States
[02:56:11.200 --> 02:56:13.200]  and countries like Russia and China
[02:56:13.200 --> 02:56:15.200]  and you were talking about the prominent voices
[02:56:15.200 --> 02:56:17.200]  that were warning against it
[02:56:17.200 --> 02:56:19.200]  we had an article a couple of years ago about
[02:56:19.200 --> 02:56:21.200]  an essay by Colonel Douglas
[02:56:21.200 --> 02:56:23.200]  Pryor who was in US
[02:56:23.200 --> 02:56:25.200]  military intelligence he talked
[02:56:25.200 --> 02:56:27.200]  about drones and he made the comparison
[02:56:27.200 --> 02:56:29.200]  that these robots
[02:56:29.200 --> 02:56:31.200]  that they're developing today for DARPA
[02:56:31.200 --> 02:56:33.200]  these killer robots quote
[02:56:33.200 --> 02:56:35.200]  make today's predators and reapers look
[02:56:35.200 --> 02:56:37.200]  positively impotent and antique
[02:56:37.200 --> 02:56:39.200]  these killer robots will share
[02:56:39.200 --> 02:56:41.200]  one thing in common with their primitive
[02:56:41.200 --> 02:56:43.200]  progenitors with remorseless
[02:56:43.200 --> 02:56:45.200]  purpose they will stalk and kill any
[02:56:45.200 --> 02:56:47.200]  human deemed a legitimate target
[02:56:47.200 --> 02:56:49.200]  by their controllers and programmers
[02:56:49.200 --> 02:56:51.200]  so you've got prominent
[02:56:51.200 --> 02:56:53.200]  voices within the US military complex
[02:56:53.200 --> 02:56:55.200]  itself warning about that
[02:56:55.200 --> 02:56:57.200]  and of course because they're merely programmed
[02:56:57.200 --> 02:56:59.200]  to kill similar to the drone program
[02:56:59.200 --> 02:57:01.200]  the deaths of innocents the
[02:57:01.200 --> 02:57:03.200]  responsibility for that
[02:57:03.200 --> 02:57:05.200]  will be diffused because there's no
[02:57:05.200 --> 02:57:07.200]  human who can be directly
[02:57:07.200 --> 02:57:09.200]  blamed for the bloodshed
[02:57:09.200 --> 02:57:11.200]  which is also an advantage if you're
[02:57:11.200 --> 02:57:13.200]  engaged in this kind of mechanized
[02:57:13.200 --> 02:57:15.200]  mass killing because you can't
[02:57:15.200 --> 02:57:17.200]  put a face to the crime
[02:57:17.200 --> 02:57:19.200]  you can't find a specific victim
[02:57:19.200 --> 02:57:21.200]  yes just a software area just
[02:57:21.200 --> 02:57:23.200]  the program went off I didn't do it
[02:57:23.200 --> 02:57:25.200]  deliberately we just put that there and it went crazy
[02:57:25.200 --> 02:57:27.200]  yeah and again
[02:57:27.200 --> 02:57:29.200]  you can just blame the technology
[02:57:29.200 --> 02:57:31.200]  you know a robot is less likely
[02:57:31.200 --> 02:57:33.200]  to value collateral damage as well
[02:57:33.200 --> 02:57:35.200]  it's like those google self
[02:57:35.200 --> 02:57:37.200]  driving cars where they may kill you
[02:57:37.200 --> 02:57:39.200]  to save a child under that
[02:57:39.200 --> 02:57:41.200]  1984 style scenario
[02:57:41.200 --> 02:57:43.200]  so they're more likely to not
[02:57:43.200 --> 02:57:45.200]  be sensitive to collateral damage
[02:57:45.200 --> 02:57:47.200]  which of course is going to end up with more
[02:57:47.200 --> 02:57:49.200]  innocent people dying we already
[02:57:49.200 --> 02:57:51.200]  have 50 innocent people
[02:57:51.200 --> 02:57:53.200]  killed on average for every terrorist
[02:57:53.200 --> 02:57:55.200]  killed by a drone strike
[02:57:55.200 --> 02:57:57.200]  and that's only going to be
[02:57:57.200 --> 02:57:59.200]  replicated and amplified
[02:57:59.200 --> 02:58:01.200]  if these killer robots as the pentagon
[02:58:01.200 --> 02:58:03.200]  have called for become 25%
[02:58:03.200 --> 02:58:05.200]  of the US Army's battlefield
[02:58:05.200 --> 02:58:07.200]  forces within the next couple
[02:58:07.200 --> 02:58:09.200]  of decades amazing
[02:58:09.200 --> 02:58:11.200]  very very frightening and of course
[02:58:11.200 --> 02:58:13.200]  this report and we'll talk
[02:58:13.200 --> 02:58:15.200]  more about this report tomorrow
[02:58:15.200 --> 02:58:17.200]  talking about superhumans micro
[02:58:17.200 --> 02:58:19.200]  targeting force fields
[02:58:19.200 --> 02:58:21.200]  directed energy weapons this is
[02:58:21.200 --> 02:58:23.200]  a nightmare scenario this is what
[02:58:23.200 --> 02:58:25.200]  you're buying with your taxpayer dollars
[02:58:25.200 --> 02:58:27.200]  thank you so much for joining us
[02:58:27.200 --> 02:58:29.200]  Paul Joseph Watson tune in tonight
[02:58:29.200 --> 02:58:33.200]  on TV news 7 central 8 p.m. eastern
