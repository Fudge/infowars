[00:58.640 --> 01:03.640]  producer director in his own right was a fan of the broadcast and then last week
[01:03.640 --> 01:09.480]  or two weeks ago he contacted me and we've got him coming on the show today
[01:09.480 --> 01:15.080]  to just talk for 30 minutes about a new movie he's got coming out that with
[01:15.080 --> 01:19.880]  true life experiences he's had then we're gonna shift gears because he wants
[01:19.880 --> 01:25.680]  to get into the New World Order and the fact that years ago his Princeton
[01:25.680 --> 01:32.800]  thesis was on the Rhodes Scholar Trust in the Anglo-American Empire and then
[01:32.800 --> 01:41.120]  that led him to some of the research and work of Jeff Steinberg with a LaRouge
[01:41.120 --> 01:45.240]  organization who I've seen many times on television never interviewed so he's
[01:45.240 --> 01:49.840]  gonna be joining us also one of the fellas that worked with mr. Stone on
[01:49.840 --> 01:57.160]  his new film Greystone Alexander Wraith is gonna be joining us as well and Bob

[02:12.320 --> 02:18.280]  about being in of course JFK but also the making of that and what it's like to
[02:18.280 --> 02:22.920]  be Oliver Stone's son all the interesting things he's witnessed I'm a big fan of
[02:22.920 --> 02:27.400]  Oliver Stone and his screenwriting he wrote Conan the Barbarian that was his
[02:27.400 --> 02:30.760]  first big hit which is the good Conan the second one's totally cheesy he wasn't
[02:30.760 --> 02:40.200]  involved in that he wrote Scarface with Al Pacino just an amazing writer it is
[02:40.200 --> 02:45.200]  what I'm really a big big admirer not even so much fan and obviously JFK the
[02:45.200 --> 02:50.280]  seminal seminal piece on what really happened there so well done with all of
[02:50.280 --> 02:58.360]  those great actors that are involved in that film so Sean Stone joining us
[02:58.360 --> 03:03.600]  coming up today Oliver Stone's son but again big producer and successful
[03:03.600 --> 03:06.600]  director in his own right has got his first big feature film coming out here
[03:06.600 --> 03:14.280]  very soon but done a lot of other projects as well that said I've got a
[03:14.280 --> 03:18.400]  lot of incredible news we're gonna cover in the first hour into the first half
[03:18.400 --> 03:22.280]  of the second hour with Bob Chapman today big developments on the liberty of
[03:22.280 --> 03:28.600]  front huge developments on the nuke front at Fukushima in Japan and radiation
[03:28.600 --> 03:33.160]  showing up at levels that they're saying are about to go above the safe
[03:33.160 --> 03:39.200]  threshold that's even according to the EPA here in the United States no
[03:39.200 --> 03:43.040]  kidding the first stuff that got here was low level radiation from just the
[03:43.040 --> 03:49.040]  leaks now three weeks ago today it's since then that you've had the crisis
[03:49.040 --> 03:54.760]  worsening with 100,000 times safe levels starting six days ago on Sunday so
[03:54.760 --> 03:59.280]  we're gonna be breaking all of that down also some police state news
[03:59.280 --> 04:03.480]  Google's making an app that would identify people's faces so you just hold
[04:03.480 --> 04:07.640]  up your phone somebody on the street and it biometrically scans them through the
[04:07.640 --> 04:12.000]  driver's license database and through the Facebook database and comes back with
[04:12.000 --> 04:20.520]  a biometric positive face scan of course they are NSA also we have Oakland
[04:20.520 --> 04:24.240]  California where you've got to get a permit to basically be a gardener or to

[04:36.840 --> 04:42.480]  yesterday they're gonna raise them coming up later this month and we've got also
[04:42.480 --> 04:46.320]  another big group of reports out confirming the border patrol and I
[04:46.320 --> 04:50.240]  confirmed this years ago but now it's doubly confirmed is ordered not for
[04:50.240 --> 04:54.400]  arrestee legals so we might as well not even have a border let's just be honest
[04:54.400 --> 04:59.320]  about it so that's coming up as well today stay with us jam-packed

[05:07.920 --> 05:12.000]  find work might not agree perhaps a recession ended for the bankers and
[05:12.000 --> 05:15.280]  government employees but for the rest of us things seem to be getting worse

[08:38.040 --> 08:43.720]  clear there's not going to be any April fools on this radio broadcast today we
[08:43.720 --> 08:48.400]  don't engage in that type of Tom Fullery when we have so many serious issues
[08:48.400 --> 08:53.000]  going on like the ongoing complete meltdown of at least one of the reactors
[08:53.000 --> 08:59.560]  and partial meltdowns at at least two to four because some some say there's three
[08:59.560 --> 09:04.240]  reactors four or five they're having partial meltdown explosions ongoing
[09:04.240 --> 09:08.960]  smoking no one really knows because the Japanese have been whitewashing it we're
[09:08.960 --> 09:14.000]  gonna be breaking that down also Libyan rebels seek ceasefire after u.s. vows to
[09:14.000 --> 09:21.320]  withdraw jets that's because Gaddafi is defeating the rebels and so they say if
[09:21.320 --> 09:24.640]  he leaves all the cities he's captured they'll talk about being friendly and
[09:24.640 --> 09:29.360]  then if he does that they'll retake those cities and continue attacking led by
[09:29.360 --> 09:34.000]  al-qaeda so we're gonna be breaking down those latest developments Rand Paul
[09:34.000 --> 09:40.120]  Ron Paul in the House and Senate both the father and son tag team are moving to
[09:40.120 --> 09:47.200]  try to get congressional hearings dealing with the fact that the president
[09:47.200 --> 09:51.160]  didn't even consult with Congress much less at the declaration of war or the
[09:51.160 --> 09:59.320]  watered-down use of force authorization resolution and at the same time they're
[09:59.320 --> 10:05.680]  moving to try to get some of the spending cut for the war if Congress is
[10:05.680 --> 10:10.160]  not consulted meanwhile the rest of Congress other than the polls and
[10:10.160 --> 10:17.400]  percentage and a few others are moving to basically now support the new war
[10:17.400 --> 10:23.320]  though they were never asked so that is all ongoing on that front that's just
[10:23.320 --> 10:27.160]  some of what we're gonna be covering today but before we go any further I
[10:27.160 --> 10:34.800]  want to play a little three-minute clip from Carl Sagan's television program
[10:34.800 --> 10:40.600]  and this particular little piece is called the mode of dust that tiny little
[10:40.600 --> 10:47.440]  little dot in the Milky Way galaxy that is our son and our solar system for all
[10:47.440 --> 10:53.080]  of these people that compete with each other and fight with each other and and
[10:53.080 --> 10:59.880]  lie and cheat and steal in the name of being dominant but then at the end of
[10:59.880 --> 11:05.040]  the day still you just die and by engaging in all of this corruption you
[11:05.040 --> 11:12.920]  basically toxify the human species of the human existence now I understand
[11:12.920 --> 11:18.680]  being competitive even if you are a upright good decent loving person when
[11:18.680 --> 11:24.360]  corrupt competitive people come against you it makes you want to rise up and
[11:24.360 --> 11:28.920]  crush them and many times you have to either politically or physically or
[11:28.920 --> 11:33.840]  economically or you will be overrun I mean you go back to our ancestors
[11:33.840 --> 11:38.120]  thousands of years ago your little tribe would find a nice little river by a
[11:38.120 --> 11:45.600]  forest with some fields good hunting and you know a year later a tribe would
[11:45.600 --> 11:49.760]  migrate into your area and try to kill all the men and capture all the women
[11:49.760 --> 11:54.360]  and children to be part of their tribe and you would have to fight to the death
[11:54.360 --> 12:00.600]  to be able to keep your family together and not see your little children drug
[12:00.600 --> 12:05.600]  off to be slaves so I understand the human instinct for war I understand the
[12:05.600 --> 12:09.840]  human instinct to fight but it's the difference between the Constitution the
[12:09.840 --> 12:14.280]  Bill of Rights our system that guards the individual as well as the mass that
[12:14.280 --> 12:19.840]  enshrines the flower of the Enlightenment the flower of the Renaissance the
[12:19.840 --> 12:26.080]  flower of Western Christian ideals that you don't even have to be a Christian to
[12:26.080 --> 12:30.960]  agree with have developed the best societies ever seen doesn't mean the
[12:30.960 --> 12:35.360]  West isn't warlike corrupt and evil you can judge it all day but then look at
[12:35.360 --> 12:40.200]  other regions and other areas of the world all more barbarous all more
[12:40.200 --> 12:45.720]  murderous all more corrupt more poor because they didn't have that Renaissance
[12:45.720 --> 12:49.560]  growing from the Greeks through the Romans then through the Middle Ages
[12:49.560 --> 12:54.360]  collapsing and then back with the Renaissance and then the final great
[12:54.360 --> 12:59.680]  expression of that 1776 Declaration of Independence it is the greatest
[12:59.680 --> 13:04.920]  expression of human liberty and ideas and true philosophy of common sense and
[13:04.920 --> 13:11.520]  what works the mutual aggression truce of the libertarians the checks and
[13:11.520 --> 13:17.760]  balances the small government system that empowers the individual because
[13:17.760 --> 13:24.720]  every time you create big monolithic systems corrupt mobs corrupt gangsters
[13:24.720 --> 13:30.520]  corrupt cartels come in buy off the government and use that large government
[13:30.520 --> 13:35.640]  system that's been built up as a apparatus to knock out their competition
[13:35.640 --> 13:40.640]  and then to by degrees enslave the country therein and they always turn
[13:40.640 --> 13:45.440]  that country out as an engine of domination and empire against their
[13:45.440 --> 13:52.200]  neighbors and those inside the Empire are then exploited to further the living
[13:52.200 --> 13:59.440]  space of the Emperor or the plutocrats the autocrats the technocrats
[13:59.440 --> 14:05.680]  whatever combination of corrupt thugs you have running things and then they
[14:05.680 --> 14:09.440]  run into another Empire who has already gobbled up a bunch of countries and
[14:09.440 --> 14:18.520]  their two borders the Persians and Alexander the Romans you're running
[14:18.520 --> 14:23.920]  into other civilizations as well and having conflict and it's always the
[14:23.920 --> 14:27.920]  same when the Romans rolled into Gaul when the Romans rolled into
[14:27.920 --> 14:33.800]  Germania they'd go in kill all the men all the leaders and kill the boys down
[14:33.800 --> 14:37.640]  to about age eight and they wrote handbooks on it Julius Caesar of course
[14:37.640 --> 14:41.560]  wrote battle for Gaul I've talked a lot about where they describe it you kill
[14:41.560 --> 14:45.040]  everybody down to about age eight and then you take them and reeducate them
[14:45.040 --> 14:48.640]  you take the boys and train them as auxiliary soldiers and they're back on
[14:48.640 --> 14:55.680]  the front in as little as six seven years and that's what feminism is
[14:55.680 --> 15:00.200]  destroying the family destroying women destroying men turning women against men
[15:00.200 --> 15:04.640]  men against women all the sitcoms all the dramas men are shown as vapid
[15:04.640 --> 15:09.480]  giggling gibbering idiots men then imprint on that and behave like that
[15:09.480 --> 15:12.720]  thinking that's manhood women then believe that's how men are supposed to
[15:12.720 --> 15:16.800]  behave and then go out and find a mate who behaves like that then they then
[15:16.800 --> 15:22.320]  they disdain them and hate them and handbooks were written on that how to
[15:22.320 --> 15:25.880]  keep the black men dumb down and not able to really even speak and then set
[15:25.880 --> 15:30.440]  the women up as their rulers that's modern feminism and that is a Roman handbook
[15:30.440 --> 15:34.800]  then translated into French then into English and we've years ago read that
[15:34.800 --> 15:41.160]  handbook on air how they do it but side issue that's only one facet of all of
[15:41.160 --> 15:47.520]  this I wanted to play this Carl Sagan clip and go over it because it really
[15:47.520 --> 15:53.920]  crystallizes that your children that are alive today before you know it they're
[15:53.920 --> 15:58.280]  gonna be gone you're gonna be gone before I know it my parents are gonna be
[15:58.280 --> 16:03.240]  gone and then I will follow on a little longer after them and then I'll die and
[16:03.240 --> 16:06.960]  then my children will follow on a little longer that's the human experience and I
[16:06.960 --> 16:20.200]  love humanity I see a powerful concert put on Beethoven's eighth or Carina
[16:20.200 --> 16:30.800]  Barana by Carl Orff or I go and see acrobats or I mean just what the human
[16:30.800 --> 16:39.400]  body the human mind artist literature poetry it is so incredibly powerful and
[16:39.400 --> 16:45.720]  and I'm in love with humanity I'm in love with our potential I believe in
[16:45.720 --> 16:50.880]  humanity the globalist also know how powerful humanity is so they seek to
[16:50.880 --> 16:56.800]  make us weak so we're more manageable but then the elite try to stay separate
[16:56.800 --> 17:01.400]  from the public but they become degraded by their own propaganda and by their own
[17:01.400 --> 17:05.760]  culture and the Carnegie Endowment documents from more than 90 years ago
[17:05.760 --> 17:10.160]  were public Charlotte Israbe's deliberate dumbing down has copies of a minute
[17:10.160 --> 17:16.720]  they're online on their site the whole books free online where they said they
[17:16.720 --> 17:21.360]  were gonna dumb everybody down and turn us into servile idiots into people who
[17:21.360 --> 17:25.480]  couldn't critically think and you talk to the public now many of them cannot
[17:25.480 --> 17:30.640]  be communicated with cannot even understand what you're saying if you
[17:30.640 --> 17:36.760]  talk about any even boiled down dumbed down geopolitical terms information
[17:36.760 --> 17:41.080]  they think you're showing off and speaking some type of Martian to them
[17:41.080 --> 17:46.760]  is completely Greek to him and my intellect compared to say Thomas
[17:46.760 --> 17:51.320]  Jefferson's and I've studied his writings his mind my intellect is a pale
[17:51.320 --> 17:55.360]  shadow compared to someone like Thomas Jefferson and ladies and gentlemen my
[17:55.360 --> 18:06.280]  geopolitical sociological psychological military general knowledge dwarfs
[18:06.280 --> 18:15.160]  dwarfs 99% of people and I am a mental midget you see man is slumping man is
[18:15.160 --> 18:21.480]  degenerating man is falling and crumbling and unraveling right in front of us
[18:21.480 --> 18:27.280]  no one can deny it and it's because we've been fed scientifically in the last
[18:27.280 --> 18:33.920]  hundred years but in the last 60 with television pure death and they don't even
[18:33.920 --> 18:37.360]  have to have all the producers and directors be part of it they were raised
[18:37.360 --> 18:44.840]  up in it so they regurgitated and they are sexualizing our children they are
[18:44.840 --> 18:49.960]  dumbing people down they are training people to value things that don't matter
[18:49.960 --> 18:55.760]  when my heart will flutter if I walk outside at night and there's a full moon
[18:55.760 --> 19:00.800]  and there's mist blowing through the you know the TV towers with their red

[19:17.360 --> 19:21.080]  beautiful I almost fall down on my knees like I have actually laid down on my
[19:21.080 --> 19:26.400]  grass in my front yard and just watched aircraft flying and the stars and
[19:26.400 --> 19:30.640]  occasionally on a clear night you can see satellites and I'm just in rapture
[19:30.640 --> 19:36.240]  with the incredible blessing of even being alive and conscious and I look at

[22:06.960 --> 22:10.280]  relies on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of government

[27:00.280 --> 27:05.880]  misunderstandings how eager they are to kill one another how fervent their
[27:05.880 --> 27:14.640]  patrons our postures our imagined self-importance the delusion that we
[27:14.640 --> 27:20.640]  have some privilege to position in the universe are challenged by this point of
[27:20.640 --> 27:29.800]  pale light our planet is a lonely spec in the great enveloping cosmic dark
[27:29.800 --> 27:38.440]  in our obscurity in all this vastness there is no hint that help will come
[27:38.440 --> 27:45.080]  from elsewhere to save us from ourselves the earth is the only world known so far
[27:45.080 --> 27:51.000]  to harbor life there is nowhere else at least in the near future to which our

[28:11.760 --> 28:16.280]  perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of union conceased than this
[28:16.280 --> 28:24.360]  distant image of our tiny world to me it underscores our responsibility to deal
[28:24.360 --> 28:30.400]  more kindly with one another and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot
[28:30.400 --> 28:35.440]  the only home we've ever known

[28:47.720 --> 28:53.720]  realized many years ago that I am humanity you are humanity we are man we
[28:53.720 --> 28:59.200]  are woman a man and a woman individually are not humanity we are the
[28:59.200 --> 29:05.040]  species we are a union we make children together the magic of the majesty the
[29:05.040 --> 29:12.240]  beauty the power of that I want humanity to succeed not just because I want to
[29:12.240 --> 29:16.240]  live forever through the species but because I love the species I love the
[29:16.240 --> 29:22.520]  struggles this is a great game a great contest of our species to crawl up from
[29:22.520 --> 29:29.400]  the muck to the stars and I want to succeed I want to glorify the good and
[29:29.400 --> 29:38.880]  expose the bad iPods basketball teams petty fights garbage that isn't what
[29:38.880 --> 29:43.360]  matters become humble when you look at the beauty of the firmament of the

[30:00.480 --> 30:03.840]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[30:03.840 --> 30:07.800]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[30:07.800 --> 30:12.040]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[30:12.040 --> 30:16.320]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[30:16.320 --> 30:20.720]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[30:20.720 --> 30:24.800]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[30:24.800 --> 30:29.320]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[30:29.320 --> 30:33.440]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[30:33.440 --> 30:37.440]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[30:37.440 --> 30:41.240]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[30:41.240 --> 30:43.960]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[30:43.960 --> 30:48.920]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at WWW dot my

[32:10.880 --> 32:14.480]  pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home I've turned in its
[32:14.480 --> 32:19.520]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[32:19.520 --> 32:24.880]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[32:24.880 --> 32:29.800]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[32:29.800 --> 32:34.160]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world

[32:41.840 --> 32:47.400]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of

[33:04.000 --> 33:13.600]  from Austin Texas broadcasting it's Alex Jones you know even five six years
[33:13.600 --> 33:17.120]  ago when mainstream media would lie about me when people I know would lie
[33:17.120 --> 33:24.320]  about me a psychopath stalkers people that have moved into Austin to basically
[33:24.320 --> 33:30.840]  try to persecute me I would hate them at a certain level now I don't even hate
[33:30.840 --> 33:37.720]  them I really feel sorry for them to see how fallen they are and I see more and
[33:37.720 --> 33:40.920]  more of the public who have not woken up to what's happening because there's two
[33:40.920 --> 33:44.280]  different groups those that have woken up and are becoming more enlightened more
[33:44.280 --> 33:48.280]  informed and others who are getting deeper into deception they deceive
[33:48.280 --> 33:54.280]  themselves it it's really magical thinking an example of this because I
[33:54.280 --> 33:57.120]  actually looked up the numbers and I understand talk radio been doing it for
[33:57.120 --> 34:05.400]  16 years been syndicated for 14 media matters came out and said that Glenn
[34:05.400 --> 34:09.480]  Beck had lost a bunch of his radio stations and had fallen before for and
[34:09.480 --> 34:13.640]  had fallen beneath 400 and I'm only using Glenn Beck as a case point example of
[34:13.640 --> 34:18.080]  media deception we can use him as an example when he's being deceptive or
[34:18.080 --> 34:21.880]  when he's being accurate but in this case it's George Soros and media matters
[34:21.880 --> 34:26.040]  and they came out and said he's fallen beneath 400 radio stations he's a
[34:26.040 --> 34:31.880]  failure he's going under so I actually went to premiere this is like two days
[34:31.880 --> 34:35.440]  ago I noticed it's now in the news today exactly what I discovered it's just the
[34:35.440 --> 34:44.480]  facts that he has 437 radio stations and gained 88 in the last 12 months and
[34:44.480 --> 34:49.960]  lost seven ladies and gentlemen stations are always selling changing formats
[34:49.960 --> 34:55.920]  deciding to put on local talk I mean that is that is that is quite frankly
[34:55.920 --> 35:01.400]  losing seven stations when you gain 80 eight of them I mean that the that's a
[35:01.400 --> 35:06.960]  number I've looked up limbaugh he might gain a hundred stations in a year lose
[35:06.960 --> 35:12.440]  50 60 I mean we gain stations more than we lose but over time we lose stations to
[35:12.440 --> 35:16.760]  format changes to other things that that's just what happens or new
[35:16.760 --> 35:20.520]  management and they have a different idea of what they want to do but I mean
[35:20.520 --> 35:24.480]  right there is just an example of media matters knowing full well they were
[35:24.480 --> 35:31.000]  involved in deception but they're not magical thinkers they're cold-blooded
[35:31.000 --> 35:38.240]  people manipulating childlike people it's it's called the false victory they
[35:38.240 --> 35:42.040]  build a straw man they say Glenn Beck is done he's plunging he is actually
[35:42.040 --> 35:47.840]  plunging on TV but that's just because TV across the board is dying because it
[35:47.840 --> 35:53.120]  can't compete with the internet that's the main reason and I did do some poking
[35:53.120 --> 35:56.960]  around he did lose a few of those stations last week and I'm not surprised
[35:56.960 --> 36:05.280]  for the rant about things I can't even say on air sucking of sores sexual parts
[36:05.280 --> 36:09.960]  I mean I in an attack on yours truly and I'm actually sad for Glenn because
[36:09.960 --> 36:13.480]  overall better his show be on a lot of stations out there than other ones I
[36:13.480 --> 36:16.960]  mean he at least talks about the private fellow reserve George Soros the
[36:16.960 --> 36:25.240]  world government but I did do some checking and looks like he not just
[36:25.240 --> 36:28.280]  because of that that episode but other vulgar episodes that's one thing
[36:28.280 --> 36:32.840]  conservative radio will not put up with I mean I've done mild things just
[36:32.840 --> 36:37.040]  reporting on what other people did and had big stations drop me over the years
[36:37.040 --> 36:42.320]  I've described partial birth abortion and had stations drop us and guess what I
[36:42.320 --> 36:46.120]  still do it occasionally but there is kind of that well don't want to get
[36:46.120 --> 36:48.640]  kicked off stations or don't want to be able to cover all this other
[36:48.640 --> 36:56.320]  information but I still do discuss it from time to time but I see the George
[36:56.320 --> 37:01.480]  Soros crowd constantly running around saying the Liberty movement's dead the
[37:01.480 --> 37:09.080]  Liberty movement is collapsing the Liberty movement is weak the Liberty
[37:09.080 --> 37:15.000]  movement is discredited the little Liberty movement is violent and then for
[37:15.000 --> 37:19.400]  every case of a conservative or libertarian beating up a so-called liberal
[37:19.400 --> 37:25.320]  I find more than 10 I know you see this as well of the different union thugs
[37:25.320 --> 37:31.640]  brutally beating people and then a Rand Paul supporter puts his foot on a woman
[37:31.640 --> 37:34.600]  to hold her down because he rushed the car and threw something in it and they
[37:34.600 --> 37:39.240]  thought I mean ladies and gentlemen when I went a major senatorial or
[37:39.240 --> 37:43.160]  gubernatorial or presidential candidate is driving up and you run out of a line
[37:43.160 --> 37:47.240]  in front of cops and throw something in the car you'll be lucky if you don't get
[37:47.240 --> 37:50.080]  tasered or taken to jail because they may think you're doing something violent
[37:50.080 --> 37:55.200]  and that's very dangerous so a Rand Paul guy puts his foot on her and that
[37:55.200 --> 37:59.680]  becomes this big sensation remember four or five months ago of violence and
[37:59.680 --> 38:05.120]  meanwhile union thugs in Florida you name it beating people over the heads
[38:05.120 --> 38:12.080]  with two by fours and it never gets on the national news and so again it's all
[38:12.080 --> 38:18.200]  about perception and it makes me so angry that that that the stock and trade
[38:18.200 --> 38:24.880]  of mainstream media and George Soros and others is to play on people's lack of
[38:24.880 --> 38:31.880]  three-dimensional or even two-dimensional thinking to deceive them now that said I
[38:31.880 --> 38:37.200]  don't make it my business to sit up here and attack Rush Limbaugh or Sean
[38:37.200 --> 38:44.000]  Hannity I have had to go after Beck a bit because he tells host excuse me
[38:44.000 --> 38:49.920]  well that too but they're not saying anymore because he tells guest on his
[38:49.920 --> 38:54.920]  show okay I noticed you've been on Alex Jones this show before I had you on I'm
[38:54.920 --> 39:00.400]  not gonna have you on anymore if you go on his show and I've had multiple now
[39:00.400 --> 39:04.600]  three different guests say yeah I was told don't come on your show anymore or I
[39:04.600 --> 39:11.320]  won't be back and he tells other people on the Fox network do know I hear you
[39:11.320 --> 39:18.480]  have Alex Jones on tomorrow no you don't or you'll never be on my show again and
[39:18.480 --> 39:25.720]  you know I mean get out of my life man I've got serious things to talk about
[39:25.720 --> 39:30.000]  and I don't territorialize this information the more the merrier that
[39:30.000 --> 39:33.800]  wake up to the New World Order but I was around 16 plus years ago you've only
[39:33.800 --> 39:39.280]  been talking about New World Order for about four years and great but don't see
[39:39.280 --> 39:44.840]  me as a competitor just because I'm you know in a cover story and talkers
[39:44.840 --> 39:50.560]  magazine about the fastest growing talk radio in the country that's what the
[39:50.560 --> 39:55.160]  industry is now admitting don't get mad just because there's a feature story
[39:55.160 --> 40:01.920]  in Rolling Stone or New York Magazine or Nightline or MSNBC I mean the fact is
[40:01.920 --> 40:07.200]  we do have three million listeners a day now we do have millions of visitors a
[40:07.200 --> 40:11.440]  day now to the websites we do dwarf you on the internet and our growth curve is
[40:11.440 --> 40:15.240]  going off the chart and we're gaining about three AM and FM affiliates a week
[40:15.240 --> 40:22.200]  so Beck can see that we're coming up on him and look man I don't care I mean I
[40:22.200 --> 40:26.880]  don't see blue dobs this competition or Judge Andrew Napolitano I don't see
[40:26.880 --> 40:30.560]  Rush Limbaugh's competition even though I'm up against him in this time slot
[40:30.560 --> 40:36.760]  that's because 14 years ago Ted Anderson said well we'd like you to stop
[40:36.760 --> 40:41.640]  doing one hour a day we want you to go to three hours a day in this time slot
[40:41.640 --> 40:45.240]  this is what stations are asking for that's why and I go up against Rush
[40:45.240 --> 40:49.200]  Limbaugh and they go yeah I said I want to call the show info wars and they go
[40:49.200 --> 40:53.440]  well we want to call it the Alex Jones show I said fine have a sure way you know
[40:53.440 --> 40:56.440]  they don't tell me what to say or what to do on this show but they do have at
[40:56.440 --> 40:59.840]  least in the past a little bit of you know when we think this is the slot this
[40:59.840 --> 41:05.840]  is the name of the show do you like that idea and I said yes so when I go after
[41:05.840 --> 41:13.240]  Rush Limbaugh which I'm about to do it's because I really feel sorry for him I
[41:13.960 --> 41:19.880]  I I want to improve him I mean I am improved all the time by listener
[41:19.880 --> 41:28.680]  advice I am improved and excoriated rebuked by people all the time and when
[41:28.680 --> 41:33.800]  it's real criticism and I see it I'm thankful for it most of it isn't
[41:33.800 --> 41:38.520]  legitimate it's delusional but when Limbaugh got caught with synthetic heroin
[41:38.520 --> 41:44.000]  hillbilly heroin oxy cotton basically off the market now it's so so deadly
[41:44.000 --> 41:49.240]  taking upwards of 100 pills a day that's enough to kill roughly eight full-size
[41:49.240 --> 41:54.640]  horses it was estimated that's how big his tolerance was I didn't say throw
[41:54.640 --> 41:59.960]  Rush Limbaugh in prison I didn't do that I said now it's wrong that you're for
[41:59.960 --> 42:04.520]  minimum cocaine sentences and heroin sentences though Limbaugh which he's
[42:04.520 --> 42:12.640]  pushed really hard over the years I said why don't you now come out against
[42:12.640 --> 42:17.400]  at least minimum sentences five to ten years in prison the first time somebody
[42:17.400 --> 42:22.520]  gets caught with cocaine or heroin crack cocaine or heroin and he hadn't done
[42:22.520 --> 42:28.880]  that I mean he was gobbling 100 pills a day of synthetic heroin doctor shopping
[42:28.880 --> 42:37.520]  to get it totally addicted he was sick and that can happen to anybody with
[42:37.520 --> 42:42.480]  alcohol or cocaine heroin anything I didn't sit there and judge him and go
[42:42.480 --> 42:49.080]  look this big guy has fallen this big guy is in trouble man I'm gonna call him a
[42:49.080 --> 42:53.360]  pillhead over and over again like so many other mainline conservative hosts
[42:53.360 --> 42:59.880]  did I don't rush in when I see somebody big who's fallen and get gleeful about
[42:59.880 --> 43:04.320]  it unless you're somebody like and culture saying the Japanese ought to be
[43:04.320 --> 43:07.840]  thankful for the radiation it's good for them lady they're now admittedly in the
[43:07.840 --> 43:12.040]  hospitals and their own government says the deaths are about to begin you need
[43:12.040 --> 43:16.760]  to go over there and live in the reactor or you need to retract what you said you
[43:16.760 --> 43:21.480]  know that type of thing I again I just can't think of what type of horrible
[43:21.480 --> 43:24.760]  person you have to be to be like that or George Mombioch the big socialist but
[43:24.760 --> 43:28.360]  but but all of that said where am I going with this limbaugh situation I'm
[43:28.360 --> 43:33.360]  gonna get back into the news last night I surf around monitoring the news for a
[43:33.360 --> 43:47.960]  few hours and I saw a limbaugh clip praising the deaths in Afghanistan
[43:47.960 --> 43:52.080]  basically and I saw the title of it and I said that can't be true and I clicked
[43:52.080 --> 43:55.840]  on it and sure enough and then I didn't want to just go off the audio clip because
[43:55.840 --> 44:00.520]  that can be edited I went to his site and found the transcript they put his
[44:00.520 --> 44:04.480]  rants up there and there it was bigger than Dallas on his website I was
[44:04.480 --> 44:10.160]  ashamed that a fellow American talked like this I was it freaked me out because
[44:10.160 --> 44:15.000]  it shows how decadent we've gotten I'm gonna play the clip in a moment but he
[44:15.000 --> 44:20.720]  said oh Rolling Stone magazine and we're gonna play part of the clip we don't
[44:20.720 --> 44:24.120]  have time to play ten minutes of it we're gonna play part of it he said oh
[44:24.120 --> 44:27.480]  you know Rolling Stone magazine they're talking about accidental deaths of
[44:27.480 --> 44:31.760]  civilians oh my gosh this is terrible because back in the old days that
[44:31.760 --> 44:37.560]  Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Dresden we wanted to kill civilians we wanted to
[44:37.560 --> 44:42.960]  to to kill people and break things and he basically acted like it was all manly
[44:42.960 --> 44:47.280]  and cool and great well according to that statement and I'm gonna get into the
[44:47.280 --> 44:51.360]  history first before I play it because there's multi facets to this according
[44:51.360 --> 44:54.880]  to that statement if you believe the official story of 9-11
[44:54.880 --> 45:00.360]  norad magically stands down three aircraft do maneuvers that top fighter
[45:00.360 --> 45:03.800]  pilots say they couldn't even do without transponders leading them perfectly
[45:03.800 --> 45:07.280]  into their targets the steel buildings magically explode and shatter and
[45:07.280 --> 45:14.240]  collapse even if you believe the official story then you've got to then
[45:14.240 --> 45:19.440]  say okay well have been locked and did this and he targeted civilians and this
[45:19.440 --> 45:23.400]  is what the red white and blue does drop it a bombs on people and fire bombing
[45:23.400 --> 45:28.240]  Dresden and killing about a 400,000 people they estimate in one night and
[45:28.240 --> 45:33.120]  threatening Germany they were going to do it and by the way Dresden was a
[45:33.120 --> 45:37.320]  non-military non-industrial city was owned as a safe city for people to send
[45:37.320 --> 45:41.400]  their children away during the bombing just like England did the biggest
[45:41.400 --> 45:45.280]  majority the biggest percentage was children not the majority but the
[45:45.280 --> 45:51.240]  largest aggregate piece was children per capita if it's great to kill women
[45:51.240 --> 45:56.160]  and children I don't agree with that by the way then it was a legitimate target
[45:56.160 --> 46:01.120]  for Osama bin Laden so see you can't have this this whole hypocritical view
[46:01.120 --> 46:06.520]  that war it's good to kill women and children it's good to devastate and have
[46:06.520 --> 46:14.040]  Sherman asked scorched earth because I remember Limbaugh and others just
[46:14.040 --> 46:18.120]  freaking out over targeting women and children targeting civilians how
[46:18.120 --> 46:24.640]  cowardly it was how horrible it was well the thousand plus drones openly say
[46:24.640 --> 46:29.720]  collateral damage is fine if they kill 200 women and children and they kill one
[46:29.720 --> 46:35.320]  bad guy they think it's okay well then that was a financial target in the war
[46:35.320 --> 46:37.600]  what do you think the globalist doing they attack a country they bomb the
[46:37.600 --> 46:42.520]  government buildings water treatment power facilities government systems
[46:42.520 --> 46:47.400]  financial systems that's I mean remember when Clinton bomb Belgrade Serbia
[46:47.400 --> 46:53.200]  blew up TV stations with people in them see the truth is I don't like double
[46:53.200 --> 46:57.360]  think I don't like hypocrisy oh it's bad when the North Vietnamese tortured our
[46:57.360 --> 47:01.120]  people but it's good when we torture or it's bad when the Russians have been
[47:01.120 --> 47:06.080]  caught torturing but it's good when our government tortures see this is mental
[47:06.080 --> 47:12.880]  illness oh it's okay when Rush Limbaugh gobbles 100 oxy cottons a day and up to
[47:12.880 --> 47:18.000]  kill seven to eight full-sized horses but when your 16-year-old gets caught
[47:18.000 --> 47:25.920]  with some five years ten years in prison see it's okay to bomb Dresden in Tokyo
[47:25.920 --> 47:31.160]  and with fire bombs and and Hiroshima and Nakasaki with a bombs even after
[47:31.160 --> 47:36.000]  Japan was trying to surrender unconditionally but then it's bad if you
[47:36.000 --> 47:40.560]  believe the fable for some have been laden to have suicide hijackers flying
[47:40.560 --> 47:49.120]  to buildings you see this is sickening level of hypocrisy now that's a side
[47:49.120 --> 47:59.040]  issue in and of itself that is a that is a complete and total side issue compared
[47:59.040 --> 48:05.480]  to Limbaugh's lack of understanding of history and I'm going to play this clip
[48:05.480 --> 48:10.480]  then we're going to come back and break down why he's wrong historically and I'm
[48:10.480 --> 48:15.840]  going to go through just a brief gestalt of the history of Western warfare we
[48:15.840 --> 48:20.680]  don't have time to look at others cultures but there's a word involved
[48:20.680 --> 48:25.800]  called chivalry let's go ahead and play this clip the documents cover some known
[48:25.800 --> 48:30.680]  aspects of the troubled nine-year conflict US special operations forces
[48:30.680 --> 48:35.240]  have targeted militants without trial afghans have been killed by accident why
[48:35.240 --> 48:42.480]  that is unheard of that is unheard of in any war anywhere in the history of the
[48:42.480 --> 48:47.840]  world that civilians have been killed by accident that's unheard of do you
[48:47.840 --> 48:51.720]  realize what this says about us how guilty how rotten to the cork in this
[48:51.720 --> 48:57.480]  country innocent afghan citizens killed by accident in the old days it used to
[48:57.480 --> 49:03.840]  be on purpose i.e. Hiroshima and Nagasaki dressed in in the old days the
[49:03.840 --> 49:08.200]  definition of winning a war was killing people and breaking things in the old
[49:08.200 --> 49:11.280]  days there was no such thing as a surgical strike in the old days you
[49:11.280 --> 49:15.000]  purposely killed innocent civilians that's what war was all about that's how
[49:15.000 --> 49:20.400]  you want it but now all of a sudden these big wiki leaks documents say that
[49:20.400 --> 49:24.760]  afghans have been killed by accident wall the incompetence of the US military
[49:24.760 --> 49:31.840]  all right now history so complex I don't want to oversimplify this but let me
[49:31.840 --> 49:37.120]  just state a fact here there is scorched earth enslavement salted earth
[49:37.120 --> 49:41.640]  systems like the Romans had where if a country or a region or a tribe resisted
[49:41.640 --> 49:46.480]  they would go in and kill all the men down to ages 10 to eight years old they
[49:46.480 --> 49:50.480]  would even then salt the earth in regional areas so they couldn't grow
[49:50.480 --> 49:57.360]  crops but even most Romans said that that was immoral and that only came later
[49:57.360 --> 50:05.720]  in the decline of the Roman Empire if you look at the Middle Ages if you look
[50:05.720 --> 50:12.040]  at what then came out in the Renaissance after that armies lined up of men and
[50:12.040 --> 50:18.520]  they fought each other and they had rules of war and you did not target
[50:18.520 --> 50:26.120]  civilians and if you did you were executed George Washington that I guess
[50:26.120 --> 50:35.960]  limbaugh would call a coward would hang or shoot and this happened any US troops
[50:35.960 --> 50:43.880]  that engaged in any type of war crimes raping stealing any of that now it
[50:43.880 --> 50:48.800]  wasn't until World War two that civilian population started getting targeted
[50:48.800 --> 50:51.720]  I want to tell you the story of how that happened so no that not in the good old
[50:51.720 --> 50:55.680]  days limbaugh not in the good old days this didn't start till World War two
[50:55.680 --> 50:58.840]  we're gonna come back break that down
[50:59.680 --> 51:04.480]  hello friends this is Alex Jones the earthquake tsunami and nuclear disaster
[51:04.480 --> 51:08.200]  that killed thousands of Japanese citizens is nothing compared to the
[51:08.200 --> 51:11.800]  devastation that could be caused by hyperinflation that will soon hit the
[51:11.800 --> 51:15.920]  United States and could lead to millions of Americans becoming homeless all
[51:15.920 --> 51:20.120]  caused by the devalued US dollar all the mainstream media continues to ignore

[53:07.320 --> 53:10.880]  know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than
[53:10.880 --> 53:14.640]  silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in
[53:14.640 --> 53:18.520]  this country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends and

[54:00.200 --> 54:10.600]  federal agents we are armed you see the most militarized vicious societies always
[54:10.600 --> 54:16.760]  develop something called chivalry rules of war because they don't want their
[54:16.760 --> 54:22.000]  families being overrun and slaughtered and killed the men say we're just gonna
[54:22.000 --> 54:28.840]  kill each other and may the best man win and that is the great expression of true
[54:28.840 --> 54:33.040]  warriors and I'm not trying to compare the mafia but at least they have that
[54:33.040 --> 54:37.520]  code the Italian mafia who's been supplanted by the Russian mafia the
[54:37.520 --> 54:41.440]  Mexican mafia the rest of it they've been legendary for not killing people's
[54:41.440 --> 54:47.920]  women and children the Mexican cartels that's who they target and it's because
[54:47.920 --> 54:52.640]  in the rules of war leave the women and children out of this don't drop bombs on
[54:52.640 --> 54:57.920]  them now Hitler was a bad guy but mainline history is a fact he would not
[54:57.920 --> 55:03.480]  bomb the British cities when the Blitzkrieg began he would only bomb
[55:03.480 --> 55:09.720]  military sites and then the British launched an attack on Berlin on
[55:09.720 --> 55:14.160]  civilian centers and it was later declassified to make Hitler attack
[55:14.160 --> 55:18.560]  British cities knowing that that would actually cause their morale to go up and
[55:18.560 --> 55:24.560]  steal them for full-bore war and then of course you know Germany was completely
[55:24.560 --> 55:29.240]  leveled so was Japan and the public bought into it because it was seen as a
[55:29.240 --> 55:35.800]  struggle for survival total war go back to World War one it was men lined up
[55:35.800 --> 55:41.360]  killing each other in the trenches so this total war thing that that limbaugh
[55:41.360 --> 55:48.680]  calls the good old days is only about 65 years old and in the old days when the
[55:48.680 --> 55:53.960]  Japanese bombed cities in China it was called barbarous and horrible until we
[55:53.960 --> 56:00.680]  then did it so the point is to to to round up kids and shoot them or to put
[56:00.680 --> 56:04.560]  thousands of men in containers for three days so they dive exposure that's
[56:04.560 --> 56:07.800]  torture that's murder that's wrong because then it's gonna happen to our
[56:07.800 --> 56:12.040]  troops and how do we then criticize it you want rules of war ladies and
[56:12.040 --> 56:19.280]  gentlemen and to hear Limbaugh up there this addled former drug addict who's
[56:19.280 --> 56:25.720]  hypocritical getting off on war getting off on death and saying you know our
[56:25.720 --> 56:29.760]  military is incompetent they need to kill people and break things and be
[56:29.760 --> 56:33.440]  indiscriminate well if you knew anything limbaugh the Pentagon doesn't have a
[56:33.440 --> 56:37.720]  public stance on not killing civilians because they're wimps they want to win
[56:37.720 --> 56:41.600]  the hearts and minds of these occupied countries these are guerrilla wars these
[56:41.600 --> 56:48.440]  are not beating the German military this is not a classical you know front on
[56:48.440 --> 56:52.920]  assault these are occupations so that causes people to resist you so that's
[56:52.920 --> 56:57.200]  why the Pentagon has a stated policy of not wanting that because they want to
[56:57.200 --> 57:01.520]  win the hearts and minds dummy and so you get up there and say this is great
[57:01.520 --> 57:05.960]  this is cool this is manly I can't tell you how many other chicken hawks like
[57:05.960 --> 57:10.880]  Limbaugh who got deferments for a boil on his rear end I can't tell you how many
[57:10.880 --> 57:14.840]  these chicken hawks think war is manly I saw a report a few years ago about
[57:14.840 --> 57:18.560]  Richard Pearl the Prince of Darkness at a cocktail party coming up to women
[57:18.560 --> 57:24.480]  bragging that he ordered bombings and was manly an obese self-propelled
[57:24.480 --> 57:28.600]  stomach who couldn't do one chin up in his life dependent on it bragging about
[57:28.600 --> 57:34.680]  killing people okay now I want to play a clip of British troops beating Iraqi
[57:34.680 --> 57:38.360]  children and listen to the demonic voices is this what the good guys sound
[57:38.360 --> 57:47.680]  like this is from Iraq bring the kids in oh yes oh yes you're gonna get it
[57:49.520 --> 57:54.360]  yes no two little boys
[57:54.360 --> 58:06.840]  ha ha ha yes yes yes yes
[58:08.840 --> 58:15.200]  please don't hurt me by the way it's been reported by survivors that have
[58:15.200 --> 58:20.760]  escaped from serial killers children and women that when they're biting chunks
[58:20.760 --> 58:26.720]  out of them and raping them that's the noises they make now that guy's probably
[58:26.720 --> 58:31.040]  gonna go back and be a cop in England so that's who's gonna rule over us in
[58:31.040 --> 58:41.200]  England in the US yes yes yes we're the good guys

[59:00.480 --> 59:03.840]  recession ended for the bankers and government employees but for the rest

[01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:01.560]  later in the shower with Bob I want to get into federal agents told to reduce
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:05.600]  border arrest Arizona sheriff says we've confirmed this years ago but here it is
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:11.240]  out of Fox News also we have an incredible video I'm gonna be playing with Bob for
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:14.840]  the prison planet TV viewers for info warriors it's up on info wars.com
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:22.440]  return of basketball hoops delayed again and it's video of arrogant
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:27.920]  Department of Transportation people coming up into their yard and taking
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:31.400]  their basketball hoops away from them this is government zoning and the
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:35.560]  incredible power trips they're on where you're being bossed around and the video
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:39.160]  and audio just just just really explains how the society's collapsing is
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:42.680]  out another report here more and more areas want you to get a license to have
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:47.680]  a garden from Oklahoma to
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:53.560]  Oakland California from Tulsa Oklahoma to this latest development you know
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:56.840]  they're saying you can't sell Girl Scout cookies in your front yard can't sell
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:00.920]  lemonade you can't have a garden and then sell it to your neighbors it's just
[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:04.760]  absolutely incredible so that the total feudal enslavement grid you study
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:09.560]  feudalism that's what it is but also the Federal Reserve following suit for the
[01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:12.980]  first time in decades the EU central banks have announced they're gonna have
[01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:16.080]  interest rate increases and the Federal Reserve says they're gonna follow them a
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:20.680]  few months after and we're gonna talk about all of that with Bob Chapman Bob
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:24.680]  of the International Forecaster good to have you here with us well it's very good
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:28.760]  to be back and I miss you last week yeah I was I was an out last week I had so
[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:34.960]  much work to do I had to take off Friday while Watson and Mike Adams sat in so
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:39.800]  that I could just get the piles of paperwork completed around here well
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:47.400]  anyway things are popping out there and Libby is going crazy and on the other
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:51.880]  hand the situation and actually and economically in the United States of
[01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:56.320]  England in Europe continues to deteriorate and of course they're using
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:00.600]  all of these distractions to keep people's minds off that we just saw the
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:06.440]  employment report come through bogus as usual I haven't broken it down yet and
[01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:12.520]  I'll have that early next week and we're also getting some startling inflation
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:17.120]  figures coming out of Europe and they're talking about as you mentioned
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:22.760]  raising interest rates in Europe and all I can say is that they must be
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:29.480]  suicidal because the minute they raise rates and cut back on stimulus of one
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:34.320]  form another the game's over and so it'll be interesting to see if they follow
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:39.800]  through with their warning this time that they're going to raise rates in the
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:46.040]  United States several people from the Federal Reserve banks have said they
[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:54.080]  really should stop using QE2 and but the the opinion is mixed and Bernanke has
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:04:00.000]  the last word I don't think they're going to curtail QE2 and I think there's a
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:06.040]  good chance they will still have QE3 because the recovery isn't there if you
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:11.160]  notice this last week they talked about businesses getting tax breaks and
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:17.880]  they're investing money in equipment that will do away with employees now I
[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:22.280]  never heard of anything so dumb in my life but anyway that's what they're
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:28.080]  doing and how can you have a recovery if you're not having jobs real job well
[01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:35.800]  it's a jobless recovery exactly I mean we got work week 34.3 hours that's very
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:41.680]  good stay there Bob Chapman I want to get into Walmart CEO Bill Simon expects
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:48.560]  inflation he called it serious inflation coming the Fed announcing by years in
[01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:52.080]  they're gonna probably raise interest rates not just the EU where you see that
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:56.720]  going I've also got Limbaugh praising attacks on civilians saying that's the
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:01.560]  way to get the job done we'll get your take on that as well a very wealthy US

[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:22.480]  predictions of the years the crazy part is he's usually right you see he

[01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:16.760]  30-minute interview right now with Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:20.760]  with his amazing financial and geopolitical analysis he normally joins
[01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:25.560]  us the third hour but we've got Oliver Stone's son an upcoming film joining us
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:30.440]  but he really wants to come on talking about the New World Order and that he
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:37.440]  basically studied when he was in college that's what that's what Sean Stone and
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:45.160]  actually have a copy of it here wrote his thesis on so that is coming up in
[01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:49.800]  fact I had his bio here guys but I think I've pulled it out or lost it so just
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:53.640]  print me that again or try to find it obviously won't be able to though while
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:57.800]  I'm busy here talking on air so just print it again thank you but shifting
[01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:02.280]  gears back to Bob Chapman Bob let's cover the financial news right now we're
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:07.840]  being told that unemployment is dropped below nine points though even 60 minutes
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:13.200]  says it's 22% nationwide 33 in California that was four months ago all
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:17.080]  the other independent groups you're saying between 22 and 24 nationwide
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:21.600]  prestigious organizations that I know you've listed here on air major financial
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:27.760]  institutions Walmart CEO is in USA today Bill Simon expecting increased
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:31.760]  inflation and calling it serious inflation we have the Federal Reserve
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:35.560]  announcing they're going to follow the move by the European Union central
[01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:39.800]  banks in the next few months to raise interest rates says Fed says they're
[01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:44.280]  likely to do it by end of year for the first time in modern history following
[01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:49.320]  the euro instead of the European countries following the feds move what
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:57.040]  is all this signified I think that they're testing the waters here to see
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:01.000]  whether it will be acceptable but what they're gonna have to accept the public
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:06.560]  and Wall Street in the city of London is a deflationary depression because they
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:15.200]  can't function without having those stimulus funds or a QE to Q QE to type
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:21.520]  injections of money from out of thin air into the economy and that's and this is
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:26.280]  something that's very important two points here and they had the G20 meeting
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:33.440]  and Mrs. Merkel the Chancellor of Germany was supposed to champion an
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:38.480]  additional trillion dollars to be spent to clean up for the six
[01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:44.240]  countries that are in trouble in Europe and not only did she say no we're not
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:50.240]  going to do that she wanted to cut back the trillion dollars by 300 billion that
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:56.000]  had already been arranged for for those countries in trouble the reason why is
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:01.760]  she got destroyed and so did in the CDU in the elections in Hamburg which is a
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:06.080]  rich estate in Germany and that's what prompted them coming forward the public
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:10.760]  a second tired in Germany are getting whipped around and paying for everything
[01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:16.320]  and they said no more the second thing that's really important too is a UN
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:24.320]  Security Council voted on the flyover block and three countries abstained
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:32.600]  China Russia and Germany very very very important because that's been a united
[01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:38.120]  front together since the Second World War on the NATO that also means that
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:43.800]  maybe Germany is thinking of leaving NATO that's a possibility so there's some
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:49.080]  real disrupting things going on and I had to put that in there because they're
[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:55.400]  important what about the Orwellian language seems to be intensifying and
[01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:58.480]  I wanted to see if you agree just when you think governments can't be more
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:05.720]  overt in their cartoon level lies they call a aerial bombardment for over two
[01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:10.000]  weeks kinetic military action they're preparing Marines from the US and England
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:14.720]  to invade saying they'll be a stabilization humanitarian force not
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:20.840]  military British SAS publicly started the thing six weeks ago using admitted
[01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:25.880]  al Qaeda forces that's now public so the West started this war against Qaddafi
[01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:31.280]  and now they're not only lying and saying this isn't a war they're now
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:35.320]  seeing the economy has been better for almost two years when every real
[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:40.600]  indicator shows that it's in freefall and they put out these fake unemployment
[01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:46.120]  numbers of 8.8 when every other indicator including the housing market
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:52.840]  shows that it's in freefall you're right and the summation is you're right but
[01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:59.120]  it's all bogus it's all lies it's all propaganda it's all conditioning but over
[01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:04.800]  in Libya the special forces have been in there for three months the CIA has been
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:11.080]  in there for years who put the eyes of the rebels they're al Qaeda that's who
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:16.720]  they are and we're arming them the man that's running it has been living in
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:21.040]  Virginia for the last 20 years and then this is all mainstream news by the way
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:25.000]  and you're right CIA for years it's more like three months the British
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.920]  Special Forces were on the East but attacking now for for close to six weeks
[01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:37.480]  but but Bob Chapman expanding expanding on all of this what is the method to the
[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:44.520]  madness why are the globalist doing this now well they want chaos throughout the
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:50.280]  entire Middle East because when they go after Iran with Israel they do not want
[01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:58.880]  anybody arguing with them nobody giving moral or or sucker to Iran they want to
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:04.640]  be able to go in there bang them and get it over with as we know Mubarak months
[01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:07.960]  ago it came out before they even overthrew him that he said no to Iran
[01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:11.680]  Egypt would not get behind it politically supporting it and now we
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:14.920]  learn they were telling him they were getting ready to overthrow Gaddafi which
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:20.040]  is to his West bordering him and he said no to that and then when he refused to
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:26.200]  step down he had that stroke well Frank Wissner went in there a month before all
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:31.120]  of these episodes of recent vintage and told him this is the way it is the way
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:35.520]  you just explained it and he probably told him if you don't do what we tell
[01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:39.760]  you to do we'll destroy you and that's exactly what they're doing the 70
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:43.720]  billion that he stole they're going to steal it from him because you know
[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:48.800]  they're freezing everything he's got as far as Gaddafi is concerned what do they
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:55.320]  want they want four water aquifers sweet oil they want a central bank that's not
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:15:01.160]  independent of his characters in Europe and the United States the new world
[01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:05.160]  order if you may what's the first thing what's the hundred and sir sorry go
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:08.080]  ahead no no what's the first thing they've already set up a central bank
[01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:12.240]  with the Al Qaeda rebels and an oil system to fund them and they're saying
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:15.760]  they're gonna put the Al Qaeda people basically in charge and give them 30
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:19.880]  something billion bucks that's right they're gonna give them part of the
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:24.760]  action because they're nothing more than mercenaries but they want that hundred
[01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:30.160]  and forty three point eight tons of gold so they can sell it into the market and
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:35.120]  keep the price of gold down so they have a number of objectives here including
[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:40.640]  killing Gaddafi that's right I was gold and he's trying to get advanced weapons
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:45.000]  from Russia and I think Russia is going to give them to him that's right were you
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.880]  shocked two weeks ago in the financial times of London confirmed that he was
[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:55.320]  the eighth largest owner of gold in the world no I knew that he was heavy but I
[01:15:55.320 --> 01:16:02.600]  didn't know how heavy I mean this guy is not dumb he's very very smart and
[01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:09.400]  without this lack of air cover he would have taken the rebels over already I
[01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:15.040]  think what's going to happen we're gonna have a protracted war on land so to speak
[01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:20.560]  and I don't think Gaddafi is going to get taken down unless they send in a
[01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:25.640]  large large force and and I don't think that's gonna happen I don't think they
[01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:30.920]  get the people to spare and incidentally that section that the rebels are in right
[01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:40.480]  now produces per capita more Al Qaeda Taliban terrorist types than any place
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:47.600]  throughout the the world of Islam now that's according to Saudi Arabia yeah
[01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:52.720]  that's according to the West Point report from three years ago now now
[01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:56.600]  continuing and shifting gears but but it's still in the same vein I want to
[01:16:56.600 --> 01:17:01.160]  play you a short clip of Rush Limbaugh talking about the Afghanistan massacres
[01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:05.720]  and the lining up teenagers and kids and killing them and then and laughing and
[01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:09.600]  giggling about it Limbaugh says this is what the good guys do he says our
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:14.240]  military basically should go back to World War two where they do target
[01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:18.400]  civilians and my point to Limbaugh is until World War two in the age of
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:23.760]  chivalry for hundreds of years the West never targeted civilians you know the
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:28.400]  mafia says don't kill women and children and so Limbaugh's claiming that that our
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:33.200]  military is is inept because they're not killing enough civilians here's this
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:39.320]  clip the documents cover some known aspects of the troubled nine-year
[01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:43.640]  conflict US special operations forces have targeted militants without trial
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:51.240]  Afghans have been killed by accident why that is unheard of that is unheard of
[01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:55.400]  in any war anywhere in the history of the world that civilians have been
[01:17:55.400 --> 01:18:00.240]  killed by accident that's unheard of do you realize what this says about us how
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:04.720]  guilty how rotten to the cork in this country innocent Afghan citizens killed
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:11.960]  by accident in the old days it used to be on purpose i.e. Hiroshima Nagasaki
[01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:16.760]  Dresden in the old days the definition of winning a war was killing people and
[01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:20.880]  breaking things in the old days there was no such thing as a surgical strike in
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:25.120]  the old days you purposely killed the innocent civilian that's what war was
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:29.520]  all about that's how you want it but now all of a sudden these big wiki leaks
[01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:34.520]  documents say that Afghans have been killed by accident wow the incompetence
[01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:38.800]  of the u.s. military all right bob Chapman you're a military veteran
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:43.760]  intelligence veteran as well historically i mean it's known as
[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:47.640]  barbarous criminals target civilians and even if some of this happened with
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:51.520]  carpet bombing in world war two it doesn't mean this is moral or good does
[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:59.960]  it no it does not and Dresden was done by England and that was on order from
[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:07.760]  Winston Churchill who probably seldom drew a silver breath and the actions in
[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:12.760]  Nagasaki and Hiroshima would it teach the world a lesson by the illuminous in
[01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:17.040]  the United States don't cross this or will obliterate you because the Japanese
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:23.280]  had tried for a year to surrender and they wouldn't let them let me expand on
[01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:28.640]  that because it's not hidden history it's a mainline history that Hitler was
[01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:33.360]  unprecedented for him to bomb military facilities in Poland he then only bombed
[01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:39.240]  in the first part of the blitz military sites in England and factories and then
[01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:43.640]  the British on record launched a giant airstrike on civilian areas of Berlin
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:49.320]  and it was later declassified to get Hitler to attack civilian centers so
[01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:52.360]  that because the psych warfare chiefs in England found that would actually make
[01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:57.080]  the brits be more pro-war and so they tricked Hitler into targeting civilian
[01:19:57.080 --> 01:20:01.280]  sites so that they could then target civilian sites and that they actually
[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:06.720]  did it first that's on record and that's something that really is it taught you
[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:10.000]  know in in in low-level history and that's not something I don't think
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:16.320]  limbaugh even understands well one of the problems that I continually run into
[01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:21.520]  among some people like limbaugh who talk about things that they really don't
[01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:28.160]  understand and it's a lack of knowledge of history and it goes back to ancient
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:32.040]  history if you don't understand what people did before you're not gonna know
[01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:37.000]  what they're gonna do next because people follow a general pattern and if you
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:43.440]  don't know what they've done you can't act on it you can't talk about it well
[01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:48.240]  you're absolutely right but I mean studying history in almost every culture
[01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:53.080]  you didn't target women and children even if you killed the men you you kept
[01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:57.720]  the women and children basically as slaves or to expand your tribe and to
[01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:02.240]  romanticize carpet bombing Dresden that killed hundreds of thousands of people
[01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:08.640]  in one night to romanticize dropping a bombs on on a defeated foe to romanticize
[01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:12.760]  it but at the same time say if you believe the official 9-11 story that
[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:17.200]  al-qaeda was cowardly and barbarous to target civilians well under limbaugh's
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:23.240]  rule he must think that what al-qaeda did was okay and I would say that it's a
[01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:31.840]  good summation well that's why your program is far better than is well I
[01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:35.560]  mean I wish he understood this but I mean look he was never in the military he
[01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:39.040]  hadn't even studied military history clearly he got a deferment because of a
[01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:43.480]  boil on his rear end and then he's pro-war I mean I you know guys that love
[01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:47.720]  yeah yeah yeah war and think it's big and powerful and in the guy you meet at
[01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:52.960]  the gas station going I'm glad we're blowing up cadafer or kill them A-rabs
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:58.040]  and Iran we're not even Iranian idiots you know these guys I guarantee are the
[01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:00.800]  type of you said let's go out in the parking lot with baseball bats and see
[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:06.000]  who beats the other one to death they'd start urinating down their leg Bob well
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:09.880]  you know it was interesting he had a boil when I went in and they were
[01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:15.280]  processing me they found I have my fingers were cut off and the doctor
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:19.960]  looked at me and smiled he said are you left-handed or right-handed and I said
[01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:27.040]  I'm right-handed he said you're hired that was the trigger finger how'd you cut
[01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:32.480]  your finger off now in a machine when I was younger working in a factory yeah
[01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:38.080]  no I cut mine off almost completely but some scan but the miracles of modern
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:41.840]  science the weird thing is it didn't even hurt that bad did it hurt with you
[01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:47.280]  well I I took off the first joint and I went on the left hand first the first
[01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:54.480]  finger after the thumb and I grabbed it and I cut off the the blood supply and
[01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:58.960]  it it was like numb and it really didn't hurt that much no that's what
[01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:03.560]  happened to me I was bizarre I mean I heard a little but it was mainly just
[01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:07.800]  bizarre the finger flopping around hanging on by some meat but I thought the
[01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:13.520]  bone was pretty it was like purple and shiny but it was white and shiny yeah
[01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:21.720]  really weird but we get something in common yeah yeah well hey I got mine
[01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:26.240]  though I'm sorry you lost yours buddy I can do parlor tricks no it's still pull
[01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:30.240]  the trigger with the other hand but it's like a parlor trick because it's it's
[01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:33.880]  numb so I you know I mean I could sit there and like take a lighter to it I
[01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:37.200]  haven't done that but I guess I couldn't impress people look I'm G Gordon Lydia
[01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:41.800]  doesn't hurt because I don't feel it all right I've digressed Bob we only got
[01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:45.360]  about eight minutes left I skipped the brakes we'd have more time with you the
[01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:48.720]  international forecaster.com if folks want to call and get a free
[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:58.080]  introductory copy of it 800-686-2237 800-686-237 invaluable information getting
[01:23:58.080 --> 01:24:04.280]  into other issues dealing with the Fukushima situation what's your view
[01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:09.880]  now on learning that reactor number two has completely melted down well I think
[01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:13.120]  probably they had a cement them all in that's the best possible thing they could
[01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:18.520]  do I would think you know they've got such problems with them they're old the
[01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:26.280]  design didn't work in the final analysis they've got all kinds of
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:30.520]  radiation goodness knows how many people are gonna die from it and it's
[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:36.000]  probably all over the world by now and and so what should they do cement them
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:43.160]  in and find another way to get the power to the area well the ongoing cover up
[01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:46.720]  the FDA said yeah we found radiation two days ago and milk and some other
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:51.640]  things but that's the worst of it but that was the radiation from three weeks
[01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:55.880]  ago that got here first now the really bad stuff 100,000 times safe levels is
[01:24:55.880 --> 01:25:02.120]  coming out I mean just common sense shows more more intense radiation is on its
[01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:09.800]  way absolutely no question and it can't be avoided and it's very difficult for
[01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:15.800]  the average person to protect themselves because nobody told him it's on the way
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:24.800]  Bob dealing with other issues in the economy we see Portugal now as you
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:29.320]  predicted three years ago starting to go under Ireland Greece Iceland now
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:33.840]  they're talking about the the the takedown being eight times bigger if
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:39.080]  Spain goes under then the banker payout that they call a bailout to the
[01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:42.720]  private bankers in Spain if the Germans are getting running getting ready to
[01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:47.280]  jump ship over having to pay off Ireland and a few other smaller countries
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:50.960]  what's gonna happen when they've got a bailout everybody else well if you
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:58.080]  remember on this program months ago I talked about the bill will be three to
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:03.560]  five trillion and nobody was listening and so they came up with a trillion
[01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:08.920]  among those countries in Europe and Mrs. Merkel was supposed to ask for another
[01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:13.880]  trillion she didn't she asked for a cut because it won't went on in in in
[01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:19.880]  Hamburg in the election and Germany is sick and tired they want out of the
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:25.360]  Euro they want out of supporting everybody they want out I think they
[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:29.480]  want out of the European Union as well and you know I lived there for a long
[01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:36.240]  time I understand where they're coming from and they're justified in feeling
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:40.240]  that way because these countries continually get themselves into trouble
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:46.840]  by spending more money than they have revenue coming in and as I said 14
[01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:55.600]  years ago before the the first negotiations the the first treaty that
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:27:04.600]  they had that one interest rate cannot service all because each economy was at
[01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:10.440]  a different state a stage of development and you can't say that Spain
[01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:15.040]  Ireland Portugal Greece should have an interest rate of 3% just because Germany
[01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:20.440]  has it wrong because if they've been bailed out by Germany then Germany's
[01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:23.640]  interest rate goes up they're being penalized for actually bailing them
[01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:29.240]  out that's right and you know if they go for the three trillion the solvent
[01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:38.280]  countries France Holland Austria and German Germany they'll all go under and
[01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:42.440]  I think Ireland's got the right idea let the bond hold is even you know who owns
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:48.920]  the bonds the Alpha Group and the Roshals the Alpha Group is the black
[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:53.000]  nobility in Europe for all intents and purposes and that's why they're praying
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:57.520]  to push the Irish into wandering the bonds the Irish is saying no we're not
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:01.160]  going to do that we're not going to pay the bond hold is off and they have any
[01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:05.560]  connections over there and that's why they want to start new wars as political
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:10.240]  distractions but I don't see it working this time more and more people are
[01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:15.600]  identifying the banking cartel as the author of this crisis and the globalists
[01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:19.360]  think they're going to get more power out of this as the days and weeks go by
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:27.560]  more and more of the leverage begins to basically turn against them that's right
[01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:35.280]  especially in the Bahrain in Saudi Arabia Yemen those countries are in
[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:41.840]  trouble and if one of them goes they'll all go and most of them are Shiites
[01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:49.440]  which Iranians are Shiites as well with the exception of Saudi and so I see
[01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:53.360]  ongoing problems that they're going to have the how bad they'll get I don't know
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:59.200]  but they could get out of hand and that would be unintended consequences but on
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:04.240]  the clock we've definitely gotten a few minutes closer to economic midnight
[01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:11.040]  economic Armageddon oh yes we're going down the road they're doing everything
[01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:16.560]  to put roadblocks up to extend everything that's why they'll have QE3 if
[01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:22.520]  they don't they may so pull a plug on the whole thing they don't have the money
[01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:26.040]  to cover the debt well Bob unfortunately it's a whole bunch of
[01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:28.800]  countries unfortunately we're out of time and I meant to get to George Soros and
[01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:32.240]  his Bretton Woods 2 coming up but by the time you join us next week that would

[01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:03.600]  network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:07.960]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:12.120]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:16.200]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:20.040]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:24.120]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:28.480]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:32.800]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:36.480]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:40.680]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:43.680]  mind folks I really believe in the solar powered generators offered by

[01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:10.240]  2009 the millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree perhaps a
[01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:13.640]  recession ended for the bankers and government employees but for the rest
[01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:17.280]  of us things seem to be getting worse gold and silver haven't heard the news

[01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:18.760]  resistance you're listening to the Alex Jones show well in the second half of
[01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:26.080]  this live April 1st 2011 transmission we've got Sean Stone joining us a guy
[01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:31.280]  who's got more film roles and cameos than Alfred Hitchcock and is also a
[01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:36.360]  producer and director in his own right he's got a new film coming out very very
[01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:43.960]  soon about his personal experiences investigating well we're gonna get into
[01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:47.160]  it in a moment but then in the second half of the interview with him or the
[01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:52.160]  last two-thirds we've got two of his associates joining us Alexander Wraith
[01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:56.000]  who's involved in the new film but also we're gonna have Jeff Steinberg who
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:00.720]  really needs no introduction he's somebody who's confronted the Bush
[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:04.920]  people and others on their banking scams on the death panels he of course is
[01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:10.520]  with LaRouche PAC one of their chiefs strategist and advisors I wanted to get
[01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:13.840]  Jeff Steinberg on for years it's never got around to it by the way I'm told
[01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:18.280]  Lynn LaRouche is gonna be joining us for his maiden visit they contacted us a
[01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:23.400]  few weeks ago coming up sometime next week via video Skype but now joining us
[01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:29.080]  is Sean Stone obviously the son of one of the most accomplished living
[01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:34.080]  directors or all-time directors Oliver Stone and I'm also a big admirer of for
[01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:39.120]  the screenplays he's written but it's great to have you here with us Sean I'm
[01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:44.840]  glad that we got hooked up yeah thank you Alex thank you for having me and I'm
[01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:49.760]  also admirer of yours the Bohemian growth thing when you guys broke in what
[01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:55.520]  was it 2004 yeah it was it was back in those days yes back in those days that
[01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:59.160]  was a no that's a heroic thing honestly what you did was you know took a lot of
[01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:04.040]  guts and courage and you really exposed something that needs exposure and you
[01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:08.400]  know I think that it this is this is also you know this is what I want to do
[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:12.640]  with my life is to you know to to go into realms of power and and try to
[01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:17.240]  understand you know the nature of of this world that we live in obviously you
[01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:20.800]  know if the power structure worships pagan gods or if they have you know
[01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:24.560]  belief structures which are mystical or mysterious I think we should we should
[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:28.960]  try to understand it and and you did a great job and and going there and just
[01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:33.000]  recording that that event that the commission of care ceremony well I
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:36.720]  appreciate that and I mean obviously that was a mystery I wanted to investigate
[01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:41.600]  I didn't really believe it what I'd been told even by some insiders until I was
[01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:45.480]  actually there and witnessed it in the old cliche rings true the truth is
[01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:50.040]  stranger than fiction now before we get into your new film I just want to
[01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:53.680]  mention the next hour we're going to get into your Princeton thesis that I've
[01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:59.160]  actually read about previously dealing with the Rhodes Trust Cecil Rhodes of
[01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:04.760]  Rhodesia and their plan for an Anglo-American world Empire give us a
[01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:09.360]  little prelude of what's going to come up in the next hour yeah sure I mean in
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:14.840]  terms of the thesis you know I really stumbled upon that you know I had various
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:20.200]  contacts like Jeff Steinberg and Dennis speed people work with LaRouche but you
[01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:22.440]  know I mainly like them because they thought they were doing some real
[01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:26.200]  homework and some real research and you know it's not to say that you have to
[01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:30.680]  agree with everything that LaRouche says because I think he's a very brilliant
[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:34.560]  man but it's not to say that you have you know that you have to become sort of
[01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:38.760]  an adherent of his political beliefs and to necessarily look at the work they're
[01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:42.320]  doing and so what happened was they'd always mentioned this guy William
[01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:48.080]  Yandell Elliot who was Henry Kissinger's mentor over at Harvard professor
[01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:52.440]  there for you know 40 years political Emirates the politics department
[01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:56.560]  government department and Elliot was an interesting figure so I thought well
[01:36:56.560 --> 01:37:01.560]  let's investigate this guy and in turn in looking at him and his relationships to
[01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:05.200]  these sort of these sort of British ambassadors and to Wall Street it was
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:08.960]  like the hub really of I would say the crop the network is really into
[01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:14.800]  intelligentsia the academies the Ivy the universities meeting with Wall
[01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:18.840]  Street and then government those you know those three power centers and
[01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:23.000]  that's really how influences made in the world if you think about it because you
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:26.360]  have to have the elites and the academia on your side teaching the
[01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:30.160]  doctrines teaching the free market economic theories or you know socialist
[01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:32.440]  doctrines whatever you want whatever you need you need to go through the
[01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:36.280]  university system first and then you come into government and then government
[01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:40.360]  is so tightly merged and wound with Wall Street and money obviously it's
[01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:44.680]  almost fascist that extent that you know that is really the core so Elliot was
[01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:49.160]  an interesting figure and that got me into this bigger question of the New
[01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:52.960]  World Order and what the Anglo-Americans were trying to accomplish from the late
[01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:57.880]  19th century forward in preserving the British Empire by using America as the
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:38:03.200]  military arsenal in a sense for it well you're absolutely right that's how they
[01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:07.600]  steer civilization we have the declassified Carnegie endowments Rockefeller
[01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:13.640]  endowments they admit all of this but I LaRouche I totally concur with your
[01:38:13.640 --> 01:38:19.640]  analysis I have never seen someone whose take on things is more accurate
[01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:24.200]  because I've gone out and done my own separate research you know 16 17 years
[01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:28.000]  ago I didn't buy what LaRouche was saying wasn't even very familiar with him
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:33.200]  did my own original you know historical research found exactly what he was
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:38.720]  saying in the early 60s is accurate and that was before Carol Quigley at
[01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:42.800]  Georgetown Bill Clinton's mentor wrote a book that was pro-anglo-american
[01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:47.600]  establishment admitting that it was a shadow government slash corporate
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:54.720]  fascist system steering us towards a tightly controlled society so LaRouche's
[01:38:54.720 --> 01:39:00.520]  research is groundbreaking and original and I concur with it about 99% I don't
[01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:05.760]  agree with some of their more socialistic type solutions but that said
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:09.240]  we'll get more into that coming up in the next hour this is going to be an
[01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:12.760]  intriguing interview because it's covering a wide spectrum of ideas tell
[01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:17.920]  us about your new film that's coming out the deals with your own personal
[01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:22.280]  experiences and what led you in these investigations to have these experiences
[01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:28.240]  Sean Stone yeah yeah in fact as you said about the Grove bohemian Grove you'd
[01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:32.560]  heard stories and you wanted to confirm it for yourself and it was very similar
[01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:38.200]  from in my case what happened was I was I was a dinner in late 2009 my father
[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:41.960]  was shooting Wall Street too and so I was visiting New York for for the week
[01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:47.560]  and did a little cameo one-day role and I was having dinner with him that night
[01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:52.120]  and a young man named Alexander Wraith who had never met before and the guy was
[01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:56.480]  full of energy he's a young actor and you're writing scripts and you know he
[01:39:56.480 --> 01:40:00.520]  wants to make movies and he's telling me these stories about breaking into the
[01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:03.640]  mental hospitals you know various abandoned mental hospitals and obviously
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:07.520]  New York and Jersey they're full of them and so there was one in particular that
[01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:12.240]  you know so this place is amazing it's called Greystone and it's it was the
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:16.960]  biggest foundation until they built the Pentagon it was built back in the 1870s
[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:21.240]  or 80s in that sort of the height of the mental health craze when they were
[01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:24.800]  building up all these asylums and trying to lock you know people away who were
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:30.360]  mentally unsound so a labyrinthine sprawling complex exactly labyrinthine
[01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:35.720]  is exactly the way it was put to me and very you know he was like the shining
[01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:38.680]  he described it it's the shining you go in there and it changes every time it
[01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:43.800]  warps there's something to it that you know it's sort of a mystery and wrapped
[01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:48.600]  in a riddle inside of an enigma so I said all right well it sounds cool I
[01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:51.200]  always wanted to go on a ghost hunt let's go you know let's go on a ghost hunt
[01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:57.840]  and next day I knew the next night we were myself a young a young girl who was
[01:40:57.840 --> 01:41:02.760]  a former Marine and and Alex were driving to the property and then it was
[01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:05.680]  almost like as we went along he would be he would say oh yeah by the way you know
[01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:08.800]  this is illegal what I'm like we mean it's illegal fuck I just really have
[01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:12.000]  course we're trespassing right so we're breaking in trespassing oh by the way
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:15.160]  they're Satanists that worship here once in a while so if you see any Satanists
[01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:21.160]  you know don't be alarmed okay great so Satanists come and worship here and
[01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:24.680]  then oh yeah in case you know there's a working hospital nearby so you might
[01:41:24.680 --> 01:41:28.720]  see some somebody like a patient you know from the hospital wandering around
[01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:32.440]  out you know every minute was like a different you know something new was
[01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:35.880]  added a new element was added well from my research of that facility to interrupt
[01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:40.880]  as you're driving in most of these big institutions they also did early mind
[01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:46.520]  control studies that exactly and that's that that was an interesting issue was
[01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:50.120]  the MK ultra program let's get to that I interrupted I apologize Sean
[01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:54.760]  continues so you're driving in he's kind of giving you the tour yes he's giving
[01:41:54.760 --> 01:41:58.320]  essentially exactly every minute it's like you know Wiley Coyote's adventures
[01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:02.920]  right like every minute there's a new is a new threat is a new element and and so
[01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:06.960]  we you know we break we basically park we run you know we run we we find an
[01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:11.320]  open door and there's a stick on the outside of the door which was curious
[01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:14.240]  obviously because it's like an indicator if you know if there's a stick on the
[01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:18.600]  outside of the door and you open it the sticks gonna fall off right so it's
[01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:22.520]  almost as though someone's patrolling or or keeping track and by the way it was
[01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:27.920]  October 13th of 2009 so October 13th I was thinking Jesus they're saying this
[01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:32.320]  here this could really be a bad night you know 13 number 13 in October
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:36.640]  building up to Halloween it's the inverse of October 31 the reverse of 31 is
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:41.760]  13 so October 31 is Halloween October 13 could be very like ritualistically you
[01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:46.080]  inverse it and there could be something going on tonight so I already had I was
[01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:50.880]  pretty jittery about the Satanist issue and we go and we start to explore the
[01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:53.840]  the corridors and what's fascinating about the place is that it's it's lit you
[01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:59.040]  know the the place is lit up and it doesn't feel abandoned it feels like a
[01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:03.920]  twilight zone you walk in there's furniture and you know it's literally as
[01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:08.000]  though they left five minutes ago you know I'm just left it as it is when was
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:12.480]  it abandoned it was over the course of 20 years I believe you know from the
[01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:16.800]  70s forward I think it was finally abandoned about three years ago two or
[01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:19.000]  three years ago because I did a little side research for the interview exactly
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:23.120]  they shut down pieces of it as it became dilapidated and as mental health
[01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:29.800]  funding got cut in the 70s right exactly exactly so yes I mean you know
[01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:33.840]  obviously we're not you know the intention is by the way is you know not
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:38.240]  just not to sort of depreciate you know anyone who has mental illness or to
[01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:41.120]  make them feel so crazy in fact I think a lot of times people with mental illness
[01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:45.360]  are seeing things that are real I don't doubt that there is another world but
[01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:48.760]  that's what I want to get to is that we you know we're searching through this
[01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:53.200]  place just step by step going deeper and deeper into the darkness and and
[01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:58.840]  literally we go up to the top levels which are really dilapidated crumbling
[01:43:58.840 --> 01:44:03.040]  the roof is falling through pitch black up there and it's as though the place
[01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:07.600]  started to come alive because all of a sudden you know there's there's a moment
[01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:11.920]  where Alex goes oh no and he you know he turns off his flashlight starts running
[01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:16.760]  like he really jumped and starts running it's I'm with the girl like we just
[01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:19.840]  started when it's printing after him in the pitch black I don't know how we made
[01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:23.240]  it like through you know all through weaving through this darkness down back
[01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:27.440]  to the first floor and we get there and Alex is literally heaving and he looks
[01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:30.520]  like he's you know he he's about to throw up and he keeps saying did you see it
[01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:34.040]  did you see her did you know oh my god did you see that I'm like what are you
[01:44:34.040 --> 01:44:37.560]  talking about I didn't see anything it was this face it was this it was this
[01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:43.280]  this woman's face like their tongue sticking out and I'm like that doesn't
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:46.920]  sound that sounds like a very particular kind of demon it's like a Gorgon mask you
[01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:50.600]  know the old Gorgon faces of Medusa and also in the east the demons have these
[01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:56.120]  their tongues out and so I'm thinking well what you know this old lady he saw
[01:44:56.120 --> 01:44:59.800]  with their tongue sticking out all right let's get out of here man like let's we
[01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:03.600]  know we saw your ghost you know that's we should we need to walk away and Alex
[01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:07.640]  no he says no no he pulls away that's fine I'm fine you know just he rattled me
[01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:11.360]  I want to show you guys the kitchen he starts walking I'm like and I'm starting
[01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:14.120]  to feel the energy now like the energy is heating up in the place in a way that
[01:45:14.120 --> 01:45:18.680]  you you get you just sense it something is coming to life I'm like why do you
[01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:22.320]  want to see the kitchen I don't understand well that's where they eat he tells me
[01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:27.280]  that's where they eat I'm like oh oh boy is is he okay and he just keeps walking
[01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:30.480]  ahead of us I don't know if this guy's possessed if he's trying to keep he's
[01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:35.480]  crazy if he's leading us on to something a joke and so he keeps going
[01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:39.720]  deeper and he takes us up and deeper inside all of a sudden we're in a
[01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:45.440]  corridor and there's this eye an occult eye you know this is an eye that's
[01:45:45.440 --> 01:45:50.960]  painted on an arts and crafts style canvas with 69 written in the corners
[01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:55.320]  and I'm like oh my god this is this is occult you know this there probably our
[01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:58.440]  satanist here too I mean where is this guy leading us and then he you know he
[01:45:58.440 --> 01:46:02.000]  leaves us through a wall and there's a death sign says death written on a
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:06.320]  chalkboard right in front of this wall it's just like if there's any there's
[01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:10.280]  ever a time to run back I said this is it we're not gonna go here says death this
[01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:15.000]  is you know everything is giving me the feeling that we're really doomed and and
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:19.480]  he keeps pulling us through and the girl didn't want to go either so I can't
[01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:23.320]  break up the group I'm gonna stay together so we go through this wall now
[01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:28.120]  we're back into the light in this link corridor and we're walking and that's
[01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:32.200]  when we started like there's footprints on the ground like pretty fresh it's a
[01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:36.520]  chalky ground how do you say it's a construction saw like a sawdust on the ground
[01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:40.480]  so there's fresh footprints walking around and there's these woody guthrie
[01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:43.680]  guitars all over the place let's say you know this machine kills fascists
[01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:49.320]  because woody guthrie was at the hospital at one time and and it just it's really
[01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:54.080]  got spooky at that point and then we heard a footstep above us like someone
[01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:58.880]  felt like someone walking above us and then a footstep very clearly behind us
[01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:02.680]  in the corridor and that's when I grabbed them like you motherfuckers you better get
[01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:06.960]  us out of here now because we get to you know we're really in trouble there's
[01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:11.160]  someone here and that's when he realized you know oh no we really are in
[01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:15.680]  trouble so we started running out and we get to we found a door that was open
[01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:19.040]  but there was a chair positioned right in front of the door so it was as though
[01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:24.600]  if we had trampled on the chair we would have created a loud noise so he
[01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:28.520]  jumps over the chair pushes through and we get outside and we get back to the
[01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:33.400]  car and we pull away and we think okay it's over and that's a great experience
[01:47:33.400 --> 01:47:36.720]  and we're gonna start writing a script about it but what what's really strange
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:40.920]  is the Satanist thing I think they're worse I think they were Satanist day
[01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:44.720]  that night because let me stop you that's exactly what I was about to say and
[01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:47.840]  I hadn't gone through the story with you yet is that it could have been them
[01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:52.640]  dressed up inside of there and he saw somebody in the dark and then the
[01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:57.720]  footsteps you heard were people yeah yeah it's a very interesting thing because
[01:47:57.720 --> 01:48:03.240]  what happens is the following night I go back to Los Angeles and Alex has a
[01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:07.400]  man standing outside of his window that's Alex Wraith yeah he has a man
[01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:11.600]  outside of his house in a hood like basically like a hood that looks and
[01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:14.600]  we can this almost sounds like gang stalking or something have you heard
[01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:18.840]  of that it is it actually is because he had he proceeded to have these guys out
[01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:22.120]  of his way no but let me stop you nobody would believe this but Ventura
[01:48:22.120 --> 01:48:25.840]  doesn't want to get into it Tyrell who I think you know doesn't want to get into
[01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:30.160]  it but the harassment and stuff the guys in suits breaking in facilities
[01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:35.360]  getting broken into the threats the CIA trying to mess with them and and and
[01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:39.120]  basically that's part of CIA mind control is they'll put somebody on PCP
[01:48:39.120 --> 01:48:43.800]  bring them to dressed up in devil outfits to free come out I mean that's what
[01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:48.160]  this kind of sounds like sorry go ahead yeah because it was definitely
[01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:51.760]  Satanist Duke consort there and I mean Alex has told me experiences where he's
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:54.880]  been to a couple of mental hospitals and they're trying to do demon they're
[01:48:54.880 --> 01:48:59.240]  trying to conjure demons that's very clear and so they believe because the
[01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:02.640]  negativity and I've seen mainline news reports on this that Satanists are
[01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:05.600]  always breaking into him because they believe the negativity will help them
[01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:10.800]  to get this power yeah they have they have to do with there's a there's a
[01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:14.400]  mixture of things it might be part of the energy that's been created in this
[01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:17.560]  location it's been trapped there obviously as you said yeah it's a very
[01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:20.880]  negative location because of the history of it the the amount of pain
[01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:25.520]  suffering also don't forget that if these patients did bring any demons so
[01:49:25.520 --> 01:49:29.960]  let's say that these patients were haunted by shadows things from the sort
[01:49:29.960 --> 01:49:34.160]  of fourth dimension and beyond right if they were if they had these shadows on
[01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:38.760]  them and talking to them as they whisper in your ear I mean this is known as the
[01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:43.400]  gin and the Arabs are very clear and every culture yeah yeah and the gin is
[01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:47.160]  very real to the Arab you talk to almost any any person from Arabia to Iran to
[01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:51.240]  Lebanon and you know he says in they freak out it's it's not a joke just
[01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:55.160]  demons we laugh but it's that's taken very seriously so if you if these people
[01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:59.720]  did have the sort of gin shadow things as parental activity show the shadow
[01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:03.880]  pretty clearly that's what a shadow would be it's you don't really see much of a
[01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:08.840]  substance it's just a vapor then the shadows are talking to them and these
[01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:12.200]  people come and they're locked inside of a mental hospital now let's say they die
[01:50:12.200 --> 01:50:17.680]  there or they leave there and the shadow stays on the shadows are now like
[01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:22.880]  that almost like consort so that's the theory is it becomes a like a ghost
[01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:29.440]  yard of ghost almost like you know the pirate ships kind of gathering at a
[01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:34.920]  secret island it becomes like a graveyard for ghost indeed exactly exactly
[01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:39.120]  because a ground like you've created a portal in a sense you know to ghost
[01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:42.200]  busters time and then the researchers think that that attracts more you know I
[01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:45.960]  never get into things like this on air even though we will everybody's got
[01:50:45.960 --> 01:50:48.960]  stories I mean I've had a few experiences my life my mother has
[01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:53.160]  especially at our home place out in East Texas everybody talks about it and
[01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:58.040]  it's it's certain places especially prisons things like that we'll be right
[01:50:58.040 --> 01:51:03.400]  back with Sean Stone hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global
[01:51:03.400 --> 01:51:07.000]  elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the
[01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:10.720]  Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could
[01:51:10.720 --> 01:51:14.240]  become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed
[01:51:14.240 --> 01:51:17.240]  even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could
[01:51:17.240 --> 01:51:21.040]  even happen again so our friends at Solutions from Science have put together

[01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:15.880]  throughout the entirety of the next hour we're gonna get into the Federal
[01:54:15.880 --> 01:54:20.080]  Reserve the monetary system got some of the folks from a LaRouche pack coming
[01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:24.120]  on but he's got this upcoming movie about his experiences Grey Stone coming
[01:54:24.120 --> 01:54:26.920]  out and I never get into this stuff because if I can't prove something a
[01:54:26.920 --> 01:54:29.960]  hundred percent I don't cover it but pretty much everybody's had experiences
[01:54:29.960 --> 01:54:34.120]  every culture something's going on and during the break Rob do one of our great
[01:54:34.120 --> 01:54:39.360]  video editors and camera guys ran up to me and told this experience just just
[01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:43.520]  real fast and we're going back to a Sean Stone to get his take on this tell
[01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:47.160]  folks the story you just told me sure yeah my band we were having a band
[01:54:47.160 --> 01:54:51.040]  practice one night and it was the middle of a song we were jamming along and we
[01:54:51.040 --> 01:54:54.120]  were doing a great version of it and nobody was singing and then all the
[01:54:54.120 --> 01:54:57.800]  sudden we hear this this scream comes through the PA and I mean it sounded
[01:54:57.800 --> 01:55:02.240]  unearthly and it sounded like pain like horrible pain and I look up because I
[01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:05.440]  thought maybe one of the singers had done something I look up at him because
[01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:08.880]  we have two singers in the band and he's just playing his guitar and he starts
[01:55:08.880 --> 01:55:13.520]  looking around and then I look over at the other singer and she's not doing
[01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:16.520]  anything she's looking at me like cuz they thought I did it and then all the
[01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:20.800]  sudden we felt this presence I felt this presence and the singer confirmed it
[01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:24.880]  she felt it too I felt this thing go through me and I got huge goosebumps like
[01:55:24.880 --> 01:55:27.640]  I've never had like that before now tell the rest where where you were
[01:55:27.640 --> 01:55:32.480]  practicing okay this is this is what's interesting it was a on on first street
[01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:35.960]  in South Austin and it used to be a children's home where they would take
[01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:40.400]  it looks like a nursing home type setup long hallways with little rooms but it's
[01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:44.080]  where they kept kids who were you know mentally disturbed and stuff like that so
[01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:48.160]  I mean it totally ties in with what what's going on and is that a place
[01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:50.800]  where bands practice or something yeah they've turned it into band rehearsals
[01:55:50.800 --> 01:55:53.520]  because I've heard of that place yeah yeah it's pretty interesting there's a
[01:55:53.520 --> 01:55:57.520]  lot of you know mainly metal bands but you know we're we're sort of like the
[01:55:57.520 --> 01:56:00.760]  the nice hippie band well there you go and I'm not gonna get any of my
[01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:03.880]  experiences I'm just gonna leave that alone but Sean Stone what's your take
[01:56:03.880 --> 01:56:10.800]  on that yeah I think you know we don't quite understand is how this white
[01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:16.120]  noise thing works in so far as I consider I consider the universe in
[01:56:16.120 --> 01:56:19.520]  terms of energy right I mean if all of existence is really just the energy
[01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:23.320]  phenomena and matter itself as we know is it just a very you know it's a very
[01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:29.560]  slow slow down frequency of energy but if they're if these things are let's
[01:56:29.560 --> 01:56:34.160]  save a higher vibration and higher density there beyond our perceptive
[01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:37.800]  perceivable eye maybe they move simply too fast I mean a bullet moves too fast
[01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:41.640]  for the eye to see so they could be moving too fast for us never you want to
[01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:45.680]  put it and they're with but they're able to ride certain waves the same way you
[01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:49.360]  know you could write various bands for radio stations what not I mean I've
[01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:54.640]  heard I've had demons call me and various caliber of voice actually
[01:56:54.640 --> 01:56:59.640]  talking to me I mean sometimes it sounds like a devil very you know just kind
[01:56:59.640 --> 01:57:02.960]  of laughing and toying with you but once it was actually really interesting
[01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:08.760]  night where the thing was very clear and very very human and it was just talking
[01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:11.880]  to me and knew exactly what I was doing I was in my apartment but how do you know
[01:57:11.880 --> 01:57:15.280]  here's the deal how do you know it's not a government scion because you're a
[01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:19.600]  successful actor your dad's one of the most famous directors out there I mean
[01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:22.600]  there's cases of government doing this how do you know some of the people that
[01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:27.880]  invited you to that to that former insane asylum how do you know they didn't
[01:57:27.880 --> 01:57:31.840]  have people there to set you up well no one invited into the same time that was
[01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:36.080]  a break-in I mean that was really illegal and Alex and I did it you know
[01:57:36.080 --> 01:57:40.360]  secretly no one known no one would have really known how do you know Alex didn't
[01:57:40.360 --> 01:57:43.560]  set it up I'm gonna ask him that when he joins us well you can ask him you can
[01:57:43.560 --> 01:57:47.040]  ask him it's a pretty complicated thing to do because the place is so big to you
[01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:49.960]  know at the end of the day would be very it's tough to it's tough I mean listen
[01:57:49.960 --> 01:57:53.920]  you're following someone you have to be really a trickster and I think you have
[01:57:53.920 --> 01:57:58.120]  to be a genius it honestly like to know where to actually set this stuff up
[01:57:58.120 --> 01:58:00.960]  because I've been through experiences with him where I've seen a girl get
[01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:04.040]  possessed a few girls a couple girls actually two or three get possessed and
[01:58:04.040 --> 01:58:07.200]  that's because you've been working on this movie researching this stuff yeah
[01:58:07.200 --> 01:58:10.720]  yeah it increased the amount of activity you're saying since you've been
[01:58:10.720 --> 01:58:15.600]  focused on it yeah I think it increases it we have to remember one thing like
[01:58:15.600 --> 01:58:18.360]  we do with what he mean growth for example I mean there's a reason these
[01:58:18.360 --> 01:58:21.520]  guys are doing this pagan style of worship they are trying to conjure
[01:58:21.520 --> 01:58:25.000]  something oh by the way we've got to go to break but you're right people could
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:28.400]  say this is just a play but I was there with those thousand men they were
[01:58:28.400 --> 01:58:32.600]  getting off in it they were on in religious rapture it was like going to a
[01:58:32.600 --> 01:58:35.880]  holy roller church where they're getting into it they were they were in

[02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:37.240]  check it out on the web IMDB what should we do yeah yeah I know it's it's it's
[02:01:37.240 --> 02:01:40.800]  almost as though you know the forces of darkness are not exactly happy which
[02:01:40.800 --> 02:01:43.560]  we're revealing something because I think it's it's very honest and it's an
[02:01:43.560 --> 02:01:47.240]  it's been a very tough film to make we've had a couple of few setbacks in
[02:01:47.240 --> 02:01:51.960]  terms of financing falling through but the film is cut so we're we're just
[02:01:51.960 --> 02:01:55.960]  working through finishing it and then you know ideally toward the end of the
[02:01:55.960 --> 02:01:58.760]  year we should have something at least started starting to come out I'm not
[02:01:58.760 --> 02:02:02.280]  sure what venue yet but we'll get the actual sooner or later it's everything's
[02:02:02.280 --> 02:02:07.320]  a process especially independent film absolutely yeah really is tough now you
[02:02:07.320 --> 02:02:10.960]  got interrupted by the break you were getting into bohemian grove skull and
[02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:16.320]  bones admitted worship of Lucifer the elites obsessed with numerology voodoo
[02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:20.960]  I haven't heard of all people Michael Savage saying yesterday he wasn't joking
[02:02:20.960 --> 02:02:25.400]  he believes the royal families into the occult multiple British prime ministers
[02:02:25.400 --> 02:02:30.080]  Tony Blair's and major newspapers being possessed by a spirit flopping around the
[02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:34.920]  ground his wife so which I mean this is mainstream news folks just Google Tony
[02:02:34.920 --> 02:02:38.920]  Blair the occult you'll get all the mainstream news they are into this why
[02:02:38.920 --> 02:02:45.120]  do people in power positions why so often are they Hitler you name it obsessed
[02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:50.840]  with the occult you know I think I think it's it's clear I think it's biblical
[02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:55.360]  think about the fallen angels and the book of Enoch the concept that you know
[02:02:55.360 --> 02:03:00.040]  when Lucifer and the army of the fallen come to earth they they become the so
[02:03:00.040 --> 02:03:04.200]  called watchers they teach they come to copy me with female women and to teach
[02:03:04.200 --> 02:03:07.480]  man the mysteries to teach him the math to teach him magic to teach him
[02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:11.560]  metallurgy to teach him the crafts you know for warfare and for politics they
[02:03:11.560 --> 02:03:16.280]  are the you know they all the all the various civilizations of old talk about
[02:03:16.280 --> 02:03:21.000]  these gods who can give them the information for agriculture for example
[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:25.120]  right the great solar teachers the the great white on key for example or the
[02:03:25.120 --> 02:03:30.240]  sun god of the of the Mayans and these various cultures they're all gods right so
[02:03:30.240 --> 02:03:34.560]  imagine that they're not it's not about alien or not it's just it's something of
[02:03:34.560 --> 02:03:39.160]  a higher order of demonic sort or angelic perhaps and it's positive
[02:03:39.160 --> 02:03:44.280]  aspects but it's negative aspects is demonic and if he's fallen are separated
[02:03:44.280 --> 02:03:47.640]  from God and there they are the rulers of this earth the secret rulers the shadow
[02:03:47.640 --> 02:03:51.880]  rulers that makes more sense to me when in terms of conspiracy because the
[02:03:51.880 --> 02:03:55.720]  conspiracy is so far reaching and ongoing how do you how can you maintain
[02:03:55.720 --> 02:03:59.760]  this people to ask for centuries and bloodlines how why do bloodlines maintain
[02:03:59.760 --> 02:04:03.000]  their their power and their interest I mean I know certain people some certain
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:07.600]  families that tell me oh if you're if you're if your blood if your money goes
[02:04:07.600 --> 02:04:14.000]  back if your money doesn't go back to pre-1400 your nouveau riche nothing
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:18.400]  about that I mean what what kind of world do we actually live in I mean most
[02:04:18.400 --> 02:04:23.200]  of us really live blind and in this kind of existential crisis day-to-day that's
[02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:26.320]  the way that we're meant to live for men and nobody's more blind than the atheist
[02:04:26.320 --> 02:04:30.160]  and the more known is more blind than the atheist that's very true because faith
[02:04:30.160 --> 02:04:33.000]  is the faith is the one thing that kept me alive I'm sure throughout this
[02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:38.320]  entire journey into that realm was that the pure faith that you know in God and
[02:04:38.320 --> 02:04:43.720]  and trust in him and you know his words Christ's words I was invoked because
[02:04:43.720 --> 02:04:47.200]  ultimately I know that protected me in the very dark times from very scary
[02:04:47.200 --> 02:04:51.760]  things that happened in very maleficent you also come from a powerful family and

[02:06:03.360 --> 02:06:07.800]  a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[02:06:07.800 --> 02:06:12.160]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[02:06:12.160 --> 02:06:16.440]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[02:06:16.440 --> 02:06:20.800]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[02:06:20.800 --> 02:06:24.880]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[02:06:24.880 --> 02:06:29.440]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:06:29.440 --> 02:06:33.560]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[02:06:33.560 --> 02:06:37.520]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[02:06:37.520 --> 02:06:41.360]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[02:06:41.360 --> 02:06:44.080]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:06.360]  announced recently that the recession is over it ended on June of 2009 the
[02:07:06.360 --> 02:07:10.800]  millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree perhaps a recession
[02:07:10.800 --> 02:07:14.280]  ended for the bankers and government employees but for the rest of us things
[02:07:14.280 --> 02:07:18.040]  seem to be getting worse gold and silver haven't heard the news either they've

[02:08:00.600 --> 02:08:08.840]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:08:13.400 --> 02:08:19.680]  well Sean Stone the maker of Ray Stone an upcoming film son of Oliver Stone
[02:08:19.680 --> 02:08:24.680]  actor producer writer director in his own right is our guest coming up to about
[02:08:24.680 --> 02:08:29.360]  30 minutes we're gonna shift gears into his thesis at Princeton dealing with the
[02:08:29.360 --> 02:08:34.640]  New World Order Cecil Rhodes Anglo-American establishment roads more
[02:08:34.640 --> 02:08:41.880]  well-traveled more of this world but as they say in Shakespeare there is more
[02:08:41.880 --> 02:08:46.880]  in this world a ratio than just the things that are in in your books but
[02:08:46.880 --> 02:08:54.320]  going back to Sean Stone Sean what does your dad Oliver Stone think of this
[02:08:54.320 --> 02:08:59.200]  work you're doing you were telling me that you met Alex at some type of event
[02:08:59.200 --> 02:09:03.200]  with your dad Alex Wraith we're about to go to what does what does Oliver Stone
[02:09:03.200 --> 02:09:05.880]  not just think of the paranormal investigation you're doing but also
[02:09:05.880 --> 02:09:10.320]  your thesis at Princeton years ago with the New World Order obviously he knows
[02:09:10.320 --> 02:09:14.840]  about the hidden establishment as evidenced by JFK and other seminal works
[02:09:14.840 --> 02:09:21.160]  he's done yeah I think I mean he's actually doing a history series right
[02:09:21.160 --> 02:09:25.040]  now 10-part history series or 12-part for Showtime and it's called the
[02:09:25.040 --> 02:09:28.680]  forgotten history of America and he's getting into some of these these things
[02:09:28.680 --> 02:09:34.080]  because he's focusing on mostly the Cold War period but from World War two for
[02:09:34.080 --> 02:09:39.120]  the most part forward and you know at the end of the day I don't want to speak
[02:09:39.120 --> 02:09:43.560]  too much you know for him but I think you know he had the most important things
[02:09:43.560 --> 02:09:46.160]  he at the end of the day he's an artist and I think he would you know he would
[02:09:46.160 --> 02:09:50.840]  not consider himself you know politically driven and so far as he feels
[02:09:50.840 --> 02:09:54.560]  that there's a certain obligation you have to society and I think he feels you
[02:09:54.560 --> 02:10:01.280]  know that Greek conception of a society that he wants to help in his quest for
[02:10:01.280 --> 02:10:04.280]  truth and that he can do that by being an artist and he put anything he
[02:10:04.280 --> 02:10:08.800]  encourages me and so far as it's a very difficult obviously business that we're
[02:10:08.800 --> 02:10:12.760]  in film because you really don't know from day to day where your your next
[02:10:12.760 --> 02:10:15.160]  project's gonna come from where your money's gonna come from your paycheck
[02:10:15.160 --> 02:10:20.120]  you know because you can there's always droughts but at least I know that he
[02:10:20.120 --> 02:10:24.080]  encourages this this ultimate quest for truth and a desire to sort of serve
[02:10:24.080 --> 02:10:27.920]  society through if it's if it's through art if it's through storytelling then
[02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:33.160]  that and then so be it however you can be of service and be of aid to your to
[02:10:33.160 --> 02:10:36.560]  your culture sure well we didn't get you here to you know just to just talk
[02:10:36.560 --> 02:10:39.440]  about your dad but obviously it's fascinating you watch the film any
[02:10:39.440 --> 02:10:45.000]  given Sunday where all the football teams have names like Templars Aztecs we
[02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:49.600]  see all seeing eyes on the backs of the football helmets I mean obviously your
[02:10:49.600 --> 02:10:54.520]  dad's let everybody know he really knows what's going on well less than you may
[02:10:54.520 --> 02:10:58.640]  think I think a lot of it has to do you know this is why the the parallel realm
[02:10:58.640 --> 02:11:02.440]  is quite interesting because you know a lot of what's what artists channel is
[02:11:02.440 --> 02:11:05.720]  unconscious and they you know it's part of that so-called a collective unconscious
[02:11:05.720 --> 02:11:11.080]  of you of you talks about you in psychology yes yeah yeah this issue is a
[02:11:11.080 --> 02:11:14.760]  collective unconsciousness and when I think my father would say is that he
[02:11:14.760 --> 02:11:18.440]  draws you know the doors for example right it's very imbued with with
[02:11:18.440 --> 02:11:22.840]  symbolism that could be interpreted as magical and mystical but fundamentally
[02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:26.840]  I don't think my father really got into that realm and notice you necessarily
[02:11:26.840 --> 02:11:29.840]  want to know too much about it I don't want to speak for him but I don't think
[02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:34.080]  that he may know as much as you you're implying about secret societies and
[02:11:34.080 --> 02:11:37.400]  actually he doesn't want to but he does channel it because we all have we all
[02:11:37.400 --> 02:11:41.040]  have this this reptilian brain let's say and we have our pineal gland and we're
[02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:46.240]  able to through meditation and to actually you know hone in on certain
[02:11:46.240 --> 02:11:49.480]  energies and waves that are around us and they're imparting information yeah
[02:11:49.480 --> 02:11:53.360]  well that's the hundred monkeys system they found that monkeys in a research
[02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:58.400]  lab three miles away in the Caribbean once they've taught the other monkeys at
[02:11:58.400 --> 02:12:02.080]  another facility three miles away magically the other monkeys certain
[02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:06.120]  suddenly are able to do the same task without being taught it that's been
[02:12:06.120 --> 02:12:09.560]  proven over and over again I just think about didn't your dad write Scarface
[02:12:09.560 --> 02:12:14.480]  yeah well I mean Scarface Tony Montana said it's the banks they had it for a
[02:12:14.480 --> 02:12:18.120]  thousand years they'll have it a thousand years they're the one wandering the
[02:12:18.120 --> 02:12:21.320]  money there though I mean there it is government drug dealing I mean he's
[02:12:21.320 --> 02:12:25.200]  obviously super smart it's all I'm saying oh yeah yeah I know he's very
[02:12:25.200 --> 02:12:30.920]  intuitive and very intelligent I think sometimes it's like I think sometimes
[02:12:30.920 --> 02:12:34.520]  he maybe doesn't want to run into certain you know at the end of the day you
[02:12:34.520 --> 02:12:36.920]  kind of have to make your deals with the devil in a sense if you want to keep
[02:12:36.920 --> 02:12:42.960]  working so he may you know he may not want to be as overt in attack sure just
[02:12:42.960 --> 02:12:47.000]  here's a big blockbuster movie where the State Department's meeting in South
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:51.880]  America with Tony Montana about assassinating somebody from the UN to
[02:12:51.880 --> 02:12:55.400]  cover up government drug dealing I mean I'm just saying wow and just giving him
[02:12:55.400 --> 02:13:00.240]  some props there shifting gears to your associate Alex Wraith why don't you
[02:13:00.240 --> 02:13:04.800]  introduce him again instead of he's got a long bio here with films and research
[02:13:04.800 --> 02:13:11.240]  and screenwriting but introduce Alexander Wraith yeah no I mean I I'm as I
[02:13:11.240 --> 02:13:17.000]  said in the beginning I met Alex at a dinner with my father back in 2009 he's
[02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:21.640]  a good friend of mine and my dad's and I had never met him before so I was in
[02:13:21.640 --> 02:13:26.360]  New York for Wall Street for one day shooting a scene and we all had
[02:13:26.360 --> 02:13:29.520]  dinner that night and Alex was going on about these various projects he was
[02:13:29.520 --> 02:13:33.400]  putting together as a writer and he was breaking into these mental hospitals and
[02:13:33.400 --> 02:13:37.640]  and you know trying to shoot a little movie like you know really candid
[02:13:37.640 --> 02:13:41.720]  camera style and I love and I just love this energy I thought let's let's go in
[02:13:41.720 --> 02:13:45.880]  I'm curious about this this realm this this paranormal realm that I've always
[02:13:45.880 --> 02:13:49.040]  been curious about but I never had experience in any way I never had any
[02:13:49.040 --> 02:13:54.920]  phenomenon throughout my life and I was 24th time so I went with Alex that in
[02:13:54.920 --> 02:13:58.960]  the next night and he's just a very intrepid adventurer and very you know
[02:13:58.960 --> 02:14:04.000]  very courageous and always you know willing to take a leap and dare and
[02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:07.640]  live it and experience it and you know never really never backing down from a
[02:14:07.640 --> 02:14:11.240]  challenge so we went and we had these whole series I was that you know
[02:14:11.240 --> 02:14:14.840]  Greystone was only the beginning of experiencing haunted phenomenon and
[02:14:14.840 --> 02:14:18.320]  going to mental hospital well we're definitely gonna have to have you back
[02:14:18.320 --> 02:14:22.040]  on in the future with Alex to break down some of the other experiences Alex
[02:14:22.040 --> 02:14:26.040]  Wraith joining us Alex how did you get into all this I mean I mean how did you
[02:14:26.040 --> 02:14:55.720]  begin investigating this? Well to tell you the truth Alex it's kind of like the way you go out and you know you guys hit up the Bohemian Grove and it's for that same feeling, that same you know to get that not rush but to explore, to be an explorer, a modern day explorer like to go into the adventure unknown you know when you go into a building or when you go into the tunnels or when you go into an area that's unexplored and no one's really there
[02:14:55.720 --> 02:15:16.000]  you get an essence of like of conquering you know the final frontier exactly exactly the fourth dimension that's it man the fourth dimension literally by the way that Einstein's calculations proved continue so continue tell us about the film
[02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:45.960]  Greystone. Well Greystone basically we came up with this concept at the same time as paranormal activity, paranormal activity was you know a cool film, cool concept about entities and all that stuff but Greystone is actually real if you google or YouTube Greystone it's a building that existed it was built in the 1800s had thousands and thousands of patients you know and then these patients went through hell man they you know basically what medicine
[02:15:45.960 --> 02:15:53.640]  they pioneered lobotomies there I mean I've seen before I ever heard about you guys in this I've seen the main line reports of what a hellhole this place was
[02:15:53.640 --> 02:16:15.920]  oh my god oh my god if you see the videos what they did to these people and how they learned how they experimented and the confusion and the complete chaos and medicine and whatnot it's just really heart wrenching you know over over 7000 people died and it took one building so you can imagine the energy you feel when you step foot on this property and you're in the woods in the dark at 2 o'clock in the morning
[02:16:15.920 --> 02:16:38.920]  and there's you know you're looking around it's heavily guarded and then there's brush and there's you're running around you know you have no idea and you hear things and all of a sudden you enter this this this colossus of a of a live entity with you feel the eyes staring at you you know and this is what it's about this is what we're trying to convey to people and to wake people up you know to wake up their spiritual side and
[02:16:38.920 --> 02:17:03.920]  and to see well I always go with the most probable and I'm no doubt there's spiritual things going on and I know the CIA with Dr. Ewing Cameron and Dr. Jolly and Wes and others did have massive mind control going on at many of these facilities and and and you say the lights are still on in many areas there I've seen news articles about it couldn't it be that you guys walked into basically a CIA mind control operation
[02:17:03.920 --> 02:17:24.920]  well listen the government did a lot of testing there whether it be with Marines whether it be with LSD and and and super super soldiers as if you want to call it but there was definitely a lot of testing done in these facilities a lot of that that's why they have under these underground tunnels you know they have 20 miles of underground tunnels connecting to various buildings around the entire
[02:17:24.920 --> 02:17:34.920]  the entire area so they would do experiments they would do what they had to do and then all of a sudden no one would know anything about it because these patients would be wielded underground
[02:17:34.920 --> 02:17:54.920]  but yeah I mean there's there's files there's articles this place was just left they locked it up they boarded it up there's videos there's tapes you know we even I've seen news photos of it with filing cabinets couches normally government doesn't do that why did they leave it intact
[02:17:54.920 --> 02:18:10.920]  I think personally that things don't go on in this place because you know the fans still work the lights still work there's there's lights in the you know we were just in the catacombs a couple weeks ago and there's lights in the catacombs man this is like you know two stories below ground
[02:18:10.920 --> 02:18:21.920]  well look at the movie conspiracy theory back in the mid 90s with you know of course Mel Gibson in that movie the government mind controller takes him to an abandoned mental institution
[02:18:21.920 --> 02:18:30.920]  right exactly exactly if you think about it what better place who's gonna go look there you know who's gonna go look there you have you have you have all the stuff
[02:18:30.920 --> 02:18:43.920]  look at Eastern Europe it came out hundreds of ghost sites at former mental institutions Sean yeah at the phone well what are you saying the ghost sites at the phone mental institutes meaning what
[02:18:43.920 --> 02:18:51.920]  I don't know it's just strange to see that congruency there that it just it just it's just the government likes to use abandoned mental institutions
[02:18:51.920 --> 02:18:57.920]  oh I see what you're saying well I mean it's a great place to hide bodies that's for sure like Alex said who's gonna look
[02:18:57.920 --> 02:19:08.920]  no it seems to me like it would be yes if you were doing like you know the greatest game certain experiments yes you could do them in controlled ways but it's not really it's not
[02:19:08.920 --> 02:19:15.920]  it's not really functional so far as you know everything's run down the furniture is run down they you know the equipment is run down it's not
[02:19:15.920 --> 02:19:24.920]  we would have seen something I think if there was like a room that was still being used with with very elaborate machinery that's a different style of tests
[02:19:24.920 --> 02:19:32.920]  you know I think that's what you're talking about is a different style like modern day MKLTRA so you think this is you really think this is some type of spiritual vortex
[02:19:32.920 --> 02:19:39.920]  oh yeah yeah yeah 100% well the pictures of the people that we have are not human that's for sure
[02:19:39.920 --> 02:19:48.920]  well I can't wait to see this film we're gonna come back with a final segment on this subject with Alex Wraith and of course Sean Stone

[02:25:03.920 --> 02:25:22.920]  okay well I mean I think the most important thing that we all have to remember is that this is real you know people always look on the internet and watch movies and it stands to them but this is you know this is flat out in your face man I mean it opens up your senses it opens up your spirits reside and it unlocks
[02:25:22.920 --> 02:25:33.920]  in parts of you and literally will change you as a person and as a human being you know when you go into this realm and you venture in and you experience these entities so we have to always you know the most important part about this film is please
[02:25:33.920 --> 02:25:51.920]  whoever watches you understand that it's an actual film and these are actual events it's not like some meetup you know handheld little projects for fun we're diving into like some deep territories and we're getting in deep you know well Sean go ahead yeah
[02:25:51.920 --> 02:26:04.920]  it's very interesting it's very dangerous I mean what happened the night was pretty amazing actually Alex was over here with a girlfriend of ours and the three of us were basically like you know about to go to sleep it was like one o'clock in the morning
[02:26:04.920 --> 02:26:17.920]  and the doorbell rings and we go to the door and it's strange because in my building you can't get up without having the phone with the doorman call up at events so we go to the door and no one's outside
[02:26:17.920 --> 02:26:23.920]  just go back to okay fine you know it's strange go back to bed I get a phone call from unknown number
[02:26:23.920 --> 02:26:32.920]  and I'm like oh no this is it they usually call me from unknown number when these demons calls it's unknown number so I'm like go get the camera I'm going to record this as I said that the phone shut off
[02:26:32.920 --> 02:26:51.920]  so get back in bed on the verge of falling asleep and boom our door the door slams inside inside of the room by itself yeah no way it just slams I mean it's a big door everyone jumps so we run oh jeez what's going on
[02:26:51.920 --> 02:26:55.920]  well let me bring this up was this stuff happening before you got involved with Alex
[02:26:55.920 --> 02:27:04.920]  no no it wasn't it wasn't so the point is it's become very intense and it's almost as though like the more you're aware of it your knowledge protects you
[02:27:04.920 --> 02:27:13.920]  but on the other hand you know it does make you a more powerful and so far so well they say you gotta invite the vampire in but once you've invited it in by getting into it
[02:27:13.920 --> 02:27:23.920]  like when you buy the Ouija board that's when this reportedly starts but I mean Alex I'm not trying to put you on the hot seat here but notice this starts when you meet through his dad Oliver Stone
[02:27:23.920 --> 02:27:32.920]  you meet Sean Stone you take him to this abandoned mental institution and then he sees these things and he said it could have been people that were inside there posing as this
[02:27:32.920 --> 02:27:41.920]  I'm not trying to you know say you're a bad guy here but I mean maybe people are playing you maybe they're manipulating you or this could be a setup somehow
[02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:56.920]  I completely understand it and you know it's a relevant point but you have to understand that the artist alone sees the spirit and when he talks about it and when he explains it and when he takes it and when you experience the essence of it
[02:27:56.920 --> 02:28:08.920]  everyone else sees it that's the thing it's you know Sean to me is a great guy and he's very courageous because of the fact that I've taken probably 20 to 30 people to this place
[02:28:08.920 --> 02:28:14.920]  I've talked about SWAT team guys I'm talking about you know I have a lot of friends here in law enforcement
[02:28:14.920 --> 02:28:21.920]  you wouldn't even enter the building Alex these guys look at the building maybe one guy one inside he jumped right outside out the window
[02:28:21.920 --> 02:28:31.920]  so when Sean goes into this place and I can see it in his eyes and I can see you know he's very very hesitant about going in but he actually takes the next step
[02:28:31.920 --> 02:28:39.920]  Sean I'm going to be I'm going to be in the east soon I want to be taken there I'll be more than happy with pleasure with pleasure it'll be amazing
[02:28:39.920 --> 02:28:46.920]  Sean will you go with me there again let's do it let's go with the camera let's go that's a great idea man that's a wonderful idea
