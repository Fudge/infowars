[00:00.000 --> 00:13.640]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones
[00:30.760 --> 00:38.440]  It's Sunday April 28th 2019 I'm Alex Jones your host and I did a week of deep
[00:38.440 --> 00:44.000]  research compounded the 25 years of research when I stepped into this
[00:44.000 --> 00:50.360]  broadcast studio two hours ago I told the crew the headline for news wars.com
[00:50.360 --> 00:59.800]  and info wars.com I laid it out it's the truth it's hiding in plain view
[00:59.800 --> 01:06.320]  in our face an international multinational crime syndicate has
[01:06.320 --> 01:11.320]  launched a coordinated operation to bring down this country and not just
[01:11.320 --> 01:15.000]  flood us with millions of illegal aliens every year but to flood us with
[01:15.000 --> 01:21.720]  individuals carrying the leprosy, bubonic plague, drug-resistant tuberculosis, drug
[01:21.720 --> 01:28.760]  resistant diseases of every type you can imagine and then when the measles cases
[01:28.760 --> 01:34.600]  explode they tell the public it's their fault and Democratic leaders in all
[01:34.600 --> 01:38.640]  these blue states and all these border states where it's breaking out tell us
[01:38.640 --> 01:44.360]  that it's people's fault who haven't quote had their booster shots it's
[01:44.360 --> 01:49.640]  incredible and then when you actually read the local health departments
[01:49.640 --> 01:53.040]  they're being truthful we put that headline back up please when you read
[01:53.040 --> 01:57.040]  the health departments in New York, California, Michigan, Texas, Georgia,
[01:57.040 --> 02:01.440]  Arizona, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Colorado, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana,
[02:01.440 --> 02:08.200]  Kentucky, New Hampshire, Maine, Connecticut, New Jersey, Maryland what do
[02:08.200 --> 02:14.240]  they say what do they say over and over again they say every patient zero is an
[02:14.240 --> 02:19.400]  illegal alien these are strains of measles that no one is protected from
[02:19.400 --> 02:25.920]  even if you have the damn vaccine now here's the problem I've done a week of
[02:25.920 --> 02:28.680]  research I mean I already knew a lot of this but I went back into the research
[02:28.680 --> 02:33.720]  and in the past they try to cover this up I'm actually very pleasantly surprised
[02:33.720 --> 02:38.400]  that the state governments and local governments are being very honest we're
[02:38.400 --> 02:41.400]  gonna show you the article show the video clips they're saying it doesn't
[02:41.400 --> 02:46.800]  matter if you've had the vaccines these versions of measles aren't from the
[02:46.800 --> 02:50.000]  United States or anywhere else they're brand-new mutations mainly out of
[02:50.000 --> 02:55.320]  Latin America and vaccines aren't gonna help you in fact a lot of folks that
[02:55.320 --> 02:57.920]  have the vaccines are obviously getting even sicker than those that have them
[02:57.920 --> 03:01.840]  because vaccines lower your immunity they cause autoimmune issues because it
[03:01.840 --> 03:04.800]  doesn't just give you an immunity to what they put in there on purpose
[03:04.800 --> 03:08.360]  everything else they add whether it's grown on eggs or whether it's grown on
[03:08.360 --> 03:14.960]  fields issue or grown on wheat you then get a allergy to that and I've got all
[03:14.960 --> 03:18.920]  the mainline Journal of Science admitting allergies are exploding from
[03:18.920 --> 03:24.640]  vaccines so ladies and gentlemen this isn't some movie like 12 monkeys with
[03:24.640 --> 03:29.200]  Bruce Willis where a crazy extinctionist globalist leftist wants to
[03:29.200 --> 03:33.000]  reduce world population and it's just theater and then they give themselves
[03:33.000 --> 03:37.400]  the bio weapon and fly around the world to release it before they die in 48
[03:37.400 --> 03:41.680]  hours this is the real world where if you go to Guatemala or you go to
[03:41.680 --> 03:46.680]  Venezuela thousands die a day from diseases of over a thousand a week from
[03:46.680 --> 03:50.040]  starvation they have lowered immune systems these diseases are able to
[03:50.040 --> 03:55.040]  spread there's no real sewage no real medicine then they come to the United
[03:55.040 --> 04:00.240]  States where we because of hygiene and because of running water and because of
[04:00.240 --> 04:05.040]  all of this even before vaccines got introduced measles mumps rebella were
[04:05.040 --> 04:10.760]  almost extinct and I'm gonna show you CDC maps CDC grabs from the CDC
[04:10.760 --> 04:15.880]  admitting this when we come back so think about it the Democrats the Vatican
[04:15.880 --> 04:19.160]  giving money up in the borders the globalist are funding you in camps
[04:19.160 --> 04:23.680]  telling people come here under Obama under Trump they flood us to break our
[04:23.680 --> 04:29.680]  immigration system our borders are our judges we have 1600 people a day that
[04:29.680 --> 04:33.720]  the government's releasing I think three times more just getting in that's like
[04:33.720 --> 04:39.360]  5,000 people or more are getting in and many of them have every disease under the
[04:39.360 --> 04:43.520]  sun and are spreading it and there's no testing so this is the Democrats and the
[04:43.520 --> 04:48.120]  globalists launching massive biological weapon attack they've launched cultural
[04:48.120 --> 04:51.600]  attacks economic attacks they've shut our power plants down and now they're
[04:51.600 --> 04:56.160]  hitting us with bioattacks and unwashed masses to bankrupt our social social
[04:56.160 --> 04:59.440]  justice system
[05:00.120 --> 05:04.560]  infowarestore.com is how you support us and it's not like we're selling stuff
[05:04.560 --> 05:09.000]  you don't need you don't want the air in the average American home is filled

[06:02.560 --> 06:09.240]  waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front
[06:09.240 --> 06:12.800]  lines of the Info War
[06:16.760 --> 06:23.040]  it's 406 Texas time at central time broadcasting from the United States of
[06:23.040 --> 06:29.240]  America I'm your host Alex Jones you visit info wars.com or news wars.com
[06:29.240 --> 06:32.800]  you're gonna see a very very bold headline let's let's put it on screen for
[06:32.800 --> 06:36.760]  TV viewers radio lizards should go there and get it and spread this link via
[06:36.760 --> 06:45.040]  email via text message however you can emergency terrorist hit 21 states with
[06:45.040 --> 06:49.760]  lethal biological weapons thousands are already dead hundreds of thousands are
[06:49.760 --> 06:55.720]  sick DHS confirms over 10,000 weaponized human carriers have been purposely
[06:55.720 --> 07:00.800]  let in and protected by the Democratic Party and the Democrat Congress and
[07:00.800 --> 07:04.960]  others refusing to fund the 12 billion Trump asked for the only got 1.3
[07:04.960 --> 07:12.960]  billion I'm gonna show you the CDC and ice saying that over 5,000 people a day
[07:12.960 --> 07:18.520]  are estimated to be getting in 1,600 are caught well over 600 are caught but
[07:18.520 --> 07:24.120]  600 are released every single day because the emergency centers are full the
[07:24.120 --> 07:27.760]  courts have a four to five year waiting list before you're even called to your
[07:27.760 --> 07:33.640]  first hearing our border is broken in the words of the head of ice and we have
[07:33.640 --> 07:39.200]  bubonic plague the black plague making a major comeback it's kept very quiet but
[07:39.200 --> 07:42.840]  it pops up here in the news there's a lot of death we have drug resistant
[07:42.840 --> 07:49.320]  diseases of every type tuberculosis you name it pouring in massive quarantine
[07:49.320 --> 07:53.880]  sanitary sanitariums have been set up all over the nation thousands are
[07:53.880 --> 07:58.800]  dying every week from it I'm gonna show you CDC documents from the CDC website
[07:58.800 --> 08:05.280]  thousands a week are dying every week hundreds are found dead in the northern
[08:05.280 --> 08:10.800]  Mexico desert from diseases that they died on their way up it is incredible
[08:10.800 --> 08:15.280]  many times children die every few days in custody minutes after they're actually
[08:15.280 --> 08:20.160]  found by Border Patrol children are just found wandering around because once the
[08:20.160 --> 08:23.040]  illegals get across the border the smugglers with the kidnapped kids they
[08:23.040 --> 08:27.920]  just throw sometimes children as young as three into cornfields they found
[08:27.920 --> 08:32.880]  hundreds of them the last week in Texas Arizona California they just use the
[08:32.880 --> 08:37.360]  children to get through they throw them to the side it is so incredible but
[08:37.360 --> 08:42.120]  right now the Democratic Party the Vatican under globalist control have
[08:42.120 --> 08:46.000]  built with the UN these huge refugee centers to take the most poor the most
[08:46.000 --> 08:52.400]  diseased the most infirm and ship them here as if America is a giant third
[08:52.400 --> 08:58.640]  world toilet I want to explain the third world is taking a giant dump on us we are
[08:58.640 --> 09:05.880]  getting the extra men the feces literal diseased laden individuals being brought
[09:05.880 --> 09:09.800]  to this country and dumped on us I'm not calling them feces as humans I'm saying
[09:09.800 --> 09:14.840]  the left and the globalist and collapse Venezuela see them as feces and are
[09:14.840 --> 09:20.000]  dumping them onto us now I'm gonna go over all these news clips I'm gonna show
[09:20.000 --> 09:26.240]  you the proof but you have to understand the Huns over 2,000 years ago this is on
[09:26.240 --> 09:31.480]  history channel this is on mainline Chinese television would catapult dead
[09:31.480 --> 09:37.120]  bodies of people with the plague or with measles mumps or rubella with a catapult
[09:37.120 --> 09:43.000]  over the Great Wall of China into military bases to disease their
[09:43.000 --> 09:48.960]  population they would throw dead bodies into wells that they knew that the
[09:48.960 --> 09:55.040]  Chinese were drinking out of ancient warfare in Europe did this also sometimes
[09:55.040 --> 09:58.400]  you have someone who was already super sick who had smallpox or had the plague
[09:58.400 --> 10:02.000]  they'd be told if you get up because you're gonna die in two days anyways
[10:02.000 --> 10:07.600]  you've got the pustules all over you if you march into the enemy camp and if you
[10:07.600 --> 10:11.680]  basically put this into their water supply or if you are among them for a
[10:11.680 --> 10:15.720]  few days and can contaminate them we will get take care of your family and give
[10:15.720 --> 10:24.040]  them a bag of gold so if understand it is in mainline Defense Department crisis
[10:24.040 --> 10:28.720]  preparation for 50 years that the Russians and others had sleeper cells of
[10:28.720 --> 10:35.000]  people with pathogens who were willing to take the pathogens the biological
[10:35.000 --> 10:39.760]  weapons and then be an incubator for it and deliver the weapon you've seen 12
[10:39.760 --> 10:44.080]  monkeys with Bruce Willis that's a fictionalized account of something like
[10:44.080 --> 10:48.000]  this but here's the bottom line the government officially at the CDC and
[10:48.000 --> 10:53.280]  ICE and Justice Department level knows that under Obama they told the
[10:53.280 --> 10:58.400]  legals come here just like Europe did under Merkel once they were able to
[10:58.400 --> 11:06.800]  break the walls down once they're able to overwhelm ice once they were able to
[11:06.800 --> 11:10.920]  overwhelm the courts which they admit they're releasing 600 a day they catch
[11:10.920 --> 11:15.280]  more than that the numbers are untold some are as high as 10,000 5,000 it
[11:15.280 --> 11:19.440]  varies every day some border sectors get 15,000 a day like El Paso their
[11:19.440 --> 11:23.320]  previous record was 3,000 this is all being reported I'm gonna show you as
[11:23.320 --> 11:27.120]  always do all the articles when we come back if your TV viewer or radio listener
[11:27.120 --> 11:30.360]  I'll go over these I'll give you the headlines you can look this up this
[11:30.360 --> 11:36.640]  isn't even hidden and that's what's so crazy about all of this that's what's so
[11:36.640 --> 11:43.240]  dangerous about all this is that a they know they're bringing these people in
[11:43.240 --> 11:47.760]  b they know they're spreading hundreds of different diseases leprosy's making a
[11:47.760 --> 11:52.320]  comeback drug resistant TV spreading everywhere and back in the day for 200
[11:52.320 --> 11:55.680]  years when you came into Ellis Island or quarantine center you were held three
[11:55.680 --> 11:59.440]  to six months showed no signs of illness three months showed signs of illness
[11:59.440 --> 12:03.520]  six months if you couldn't be cured shipped back to Ireland or Italy or
[12:03.520 --> 12:09.520]  Japan wherever you came from now they don't even test them when they come in
[12:09.520 --> 12:15.080]  they don't even test them when they come in they just load them on Democrat
[12:15.080 --> 12:18.320]  control buses they're shipped all over the country and if you look at the map
[12:18.320 --> 12:24.880]  it's up on info wars.com it's on the live feed page we put out emergency
[12:24.880 --> 12:29.560]  terrorists hit 21 states with lethal biological weapons that is a homeland
[12:29.560 --> 12:34.400]  security map that I put up with the biohazard symbol over it's showing
[12:34.400 --> 12:40.040]  Washington, Oregon, Nevada, California, Arizona, Colorado, Texas, Missouri, Illinois,
[12:40.040 --> 12:46.720]  Indiana, Kentucky, Georgia, Florida, Michigan, New York, New Hampshire, Maine,
[12:46.720 --> 12:52.280]  Connecticut, New Jersey, and Maryland all have thousands of cases of measles per
[12:52.280 --> 12:58.360]  state and in all the local news they admit okay yeah it was migrants but then
[12:58.360 --> 13:01.520]  how are you supposed to then get vaccinated even if you've been vaccinated
[13:01.520 --> 13:05.440]  this is a new mutation of measles they've been admitting the articles I'm gonna
[13:05.440 --> 13:10.240]  show you when we come back you're not protected that's what's so incredible
[13:10.240 --> 13:15.640]  about this I'm gonna show you local news local health departments from
[13:15.640 --> 13:19.880]  California to New York saying illegals brought it in I'm gonna show you the CDC
[13:19.880 --> 13:22.840]  admitting it I'm gonna show them admitting the vaccines doesn't protect
[13:22.840 --> 13:28.960]  you because it's a new mutations I'm gonna show you every piece of this why
[13:28.960 --> 13:33.320]  would the Democrats and the globalists do this and then tell you like mayor
[13:33.320 --> 13:38.800]  de Blasio it's your fault Intel orthodox Hasidic Jews when Leviticus bars
[13:38.800 --> 13:42.840]  putting something in your body that has other people's DNA in it don't mix the
[13:42.840 --> 13:47.600]  seed that's common sense that's their choice don't take blood transfusions
[13:47.600 --> 13:50.680]  don't do that's their right under release freedom they're arresting them
[13:50.680 --> 13:54.760]  and forcibly inoculating them with vaccines that don't even protect you
[13:54.760 --> 14:00.760]  I'm gonna say it again I know about technology I study the flu shot if they
[14:00.760 --> 14:04.720]  ever guess the right mutation would work they've never guessed the right
[14:04.720 --> 14:10.000]  mutation it doesn't help instead it lowers immunity and any contaminants of
[14:10.000 --> 14:14.760]  the vaccine you then get an autoimmune response to do you know what's I'm gonna
[14:14.760 --> 14:18.720]  show you government documents when we come back of the thousands of things
[14:18.720 --> 14:23.320]  that have been found in vaccines so when you get an immunity to that
[14:23.320 --> 14:27.640]  particular attenuated flu virus that they either microwave or radiate and
[14:27.640 --> 14:33.960]  break up so it doesn't full effect anything else in the damn shot you then
[14:33.960 --> 14:39.800]  have an autoimmune response to do you understand your body then recognizes
[14:39.800 --> 14:43.680]  whatever else is in there as an attack and that's where we're getting all these
[14:43.680 --> 14:48.440]  cancers and I'm gonna go over at all I'm gonna show you the CDC admitting
[14:48.440 --> 14:54.520]  hundreds of millions of people got cancer from human papillomavirus 40 and
[14:54.520 --> 15:02.080]  SV 40 and just all of us I'm going to show you all of this that's what's so
[15:02.080 --> 15:05.920]  frustrating they say oh conspiracy theorists oh fake news no they don't
[15:05.920 --> 15:09.920]  want me on air because they don't want us covering these real things at these
[15:09.920 --> 15:15.120]  points I've had 50 or 60 medical doctors on I've had virologist on I've had
[15:15.120 --> 15:20.040]  brain surgeons on I've read the literature but you can't deny this even
[15:20.040 --> 15:22.960]  if you think vaccines are totally safe they're gonna show you a measles mumps
[15:22.960 --> 15:27.600]  rubella Merck insert where does it can kill you cause autoimmune disorders I'm
[15:27.600 --> 15:32.880]  gonna show you from the drug itself hear that I'm gonna show you not the fact
[15:32.880 --> 15:36.240]  sheet that the drug company will tell you the actual insert by law they got to
[15:36.240 --> 15:40.200]  give you where it says it can kill you regardless doesn't matter they're
[15:40.200 --> 15:44.840]  letting the illegal aliens in there the cause and so it is a biological
[15:44.840 --> 15:51.360]  terror attack with human carriers of it this is incredible call everyone you
[15:51.360 --> 15:55.280]  know no matter how you're listening on AM FM TV radio or info wars dot com
[15:55.280 --> 16:01.200]  four slash show and this is a public health emergency warn everyone I want
[16:01.200 --> 16:05.120]  to say brain force is great I want to say turbo force is amazing it is but if
[16:05.120 --> 16:10.560]  you took it with fish oil it's like the fish oil is it the fish oil is better
[16:10.560 --> 16:14.560]  than that and that's an example of what I'm talking about fish oil is liquid
[16:14.560 --> 16:19.080]  energy brain body heart the cleanest the best out there you've got the
[16:19.080 --> 16:22.800]  children's you've got the adults got the krill oil if you're gonna get the full
[16:22.800 --> 16:25.800]  effect the fish oil and the children's are really strong they don't give you
[16:25.800 --> 16:29.520]  the burpees but krill oil is the best and it'll give you the damn burps and I'm
[16:29.520 --> 16:32.520]  just sorry you want something like this you don't get stuff for free the krill
[16:32.520 --> 16:36.560]  is hallucinogenic it's so good it in my view I'm not a medical statement here
[16:36.560 --> 16:39.960]  but let me tell you something I eat five capillates of krill oil before I go to
[16:39.960 --> 16:47.400]  bed I'm seeing Santa Claus that night so your brain is made basically out of
[16:47.400 --> 16:53.840]  what fish oil is so we don't make a big profit off of it but you notice I just
[16:53.840 --> 16:57.720]  obsessed with whatever the best is we've got I just can't lie to you I just can't
[16:57.720 --> 17:05.400]  do it defeat the globalist hashtag Alex Jones defeat the pedophiles hashtag

[17:16.880 --> 17:20.920]  every platform out there but we've just gotten stronger because you've taken
[17:20.920 --> 17:27.600]  action with hashtag Alex Jones I am patient zero in the massive banning but
[17:27.600 --> 17:31.160]  you can override the sensors now and if all of our audience gets involved with
[17:31.160 --> 17:36.000]  hashtag Alex Jones we are unstoppable together we've already changed the world

[17:50.120 --> 17:53.720]  cry to restore the First Amendment
[17:53.720 --> 18:01.280]  creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit info war's life
[18:01.280 --> 18:06.040]  is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine introducing pollen block we
[18:06.040 --> 18:10.440]  have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress
[18:10.440 --> 18:15.800]  symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways eye comfort and
[18:15.800 --> 18:21.280]  respiratory function in the 1960s researchers in France noticed that
[18:21.280 --> 18:25.160]  people who ate certain quail eggs experience less seasonal immune and
[18:25.160 --> 18:29.600]  inflammatory responses they began studying this effect in published trials
[18:29.600 --> 18:34.720]  and decades later we now have the fruit of this research a fast-acting chewable
[18:34.720 --> 18:38.920]  tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms pollen block is
[18:38.920 --> 18:43.680]  natural and effective it is not an antihistamine in fact current research
[18:43.680 --> 18:47.720]  is found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase which
[18:47.720 --> 18:52.680]  is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body go

[19:59.920 --> 20:08.560]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:08.560 --> 20:36.080]  I want to quantify this right now if somebody comes to your elementary school
[20:36.080 --> 20:40.480]  where your children go where your child goes and they have pertussis or whooping
[20:40.480 --> 20:46.240]  cough that's a serious illness and I wish the study showed that the vaccine
[20:46.240 --> 20:49.600]  helped actually shows it can lower immunity and give you whooping cough
[20:49.600 --> 20:53.600]  sometimes and might protect you from a few of the hundreds of strains out there
[20:53.600 --> 20:57.600]  so I just do my research there was something keep my children from getting
[20:57.600 --> 21:02.240]  something it wouldn't hurt them damn run I'll use it I use antibiotics they're
[21:02.240 --> 21:05.600]  toxic they hurt your liver they lower your immunity but if your kids really
[21:05.600 --> 21:10.960]  sick for a while you got to give it to them but big pharma since 1984 has been
[21:10.960 --> 21:16.360]  given tens of billions of dollars of us taxpayer money vaccines are tax exempt
[21:16.360 --> 21:22.280]  and their liability exempt I'm gonna show you mainstream news where Japan
[21:22.280 --> 21:27.280]  has banned measles bumps and rubella shots because they cause so much brain
[21:27.280 --> 21:32.680]  damage and so much autism but let's just digress info wars dot com has the
[21:32.680 --> 21:37.120]  headline for the live feed of the show that you can share with everybody you
[21:37.120 --> 21:44.720]  know let's put it up on screen emergency terrorist hit 21 states with
[21:44.720 --> 21:49.920]  lethal biological weapons now the Democratic Party openly says that
[21:49.920 --> 21:55.920]  Trump is a Nazi I'm gonna play the clip of Beto coming up Beto if he wants to
[21:55.920 --> 22:00.440]  stop anybody coming in he says we should have no borders everybody knows you go
[22:00.440 --> 22:04.640]  to Guatemala or Venezuela or other areas say Paraguay is really dangerous and
[22:04.640 --> 22:09.240]  full of disease most people that go down there even that are vaccinated get
[22:09.240 --> 22:17.040]  really sick so we've got 1600 people a day being caught coming in I'm sorry
[22:17.040 --> 22:23.280]  1600 a day release they catch 5000 they don't know how many are actually making
[22:23.280 --> 22:26.080]  it through that's the technical answer I'll show you the Homeland Security
[22:26.080 --> 22:34.400]  announcements here 1600 release today of 5000 that are caught but they're about
[22:34.400 --> 22:36.680]  to have to increase that because they're overwhelmed and they don't know how many
[22:36.680 --> 22:43.000]  get it so I'm gonna show you ABC news it's already on screen if you're a TV
[22:43.000 --> 22:46.520]  viewer and some cable and TV stations you can see this and the good news is
[22:46.520 --> 22:53.480]  this actually comes out in the news but it's a footnote that they open the
[22:53.480 --> 22:57.480]  borders they don't test people and again you can watch PBS documentaries on
[22:57.480 --> 23:03.560]  this just type in the history of Ellis Island I've watched documentaries and
[23:03.560 --> 23:07.400]  they set it up like 150 years ago but before that they had quarantine centers
[23:07.400 --> 23:15.160]  on the Peninsula of New York not just on that island and they would keep you
[23:15.160 --> 23:20.240]  three to six months they don't test anybody they they just load them on
[23:20.240 --> 23:25.000]  Democrat-controlled buses and ship them into the country and then when Trump
[23:25.000 --> 23:29.320]  says fine I'll ship them in to Democrat cities they go no no no we don't want
[23:29.320 --> 23:35.760]  them so let's go over the facts here El Paso eight agencies overwhelmed as
[23:35.760 --> 23:43.040]  1600 migrants are cast onto the streets every single day and the liberals bitch
[23:43.040 --> 23:46.880]  and say hey give them everything for free not like we're bringing them in
[23:46.880 --> 23:50.240]  here and give them everything for you already as ice releases hundreds of
[23:50.240 --> 23:56.360]  migrants in national Paso local shelter eyes more beds Cory Booker admits
[23:56.360 --> 24:02.360]  releasing migrants into sanctuary cities would make us less safe over 1000
[24:02.360 --> 24:07.000]  quarantine and measles scare in LA universities AP I'm gonna play a clip in
[24:07.000 --> 24:10.880]  a moment of a doctor in LA saying who heads the program up this is coming from
[24:10.880 --> 24:15.120]  illegal aliens this is because our border is open
[24:15.120 --> 24:19.160]  fact let's start going to that right now I mentioned all this last segment now
[24:19.160 --> 24:25.120]  we're gonna go through them admitting it and this is a biological war and it's
[24:25.120 --> 24:28.400]  mean to the illegal aliens that they call migrants to not test them and not
[24:28.400 --> 24:31.400]  take care of them but see this is all part of weighing the country down you
[24:31.400 --> 24:35.000]  think China let's folks in try to find a China they test you they test if you
[24:35.000 --> 24:39.520]  have a fever they quarantine you they think you're sick that's normal we do
[24:39.520 --> 24:43.920]  nothing because it's all part of bankrupting the country and then you get
[24:43.920 --> 24:46.560]  people that are sick in the hospitals and they spread it to hundreds that cost
[24:46.560 --> 24:50.280]  millions of dollars all weighing the nation down cloward and piven the
[24:50.280 --> 24:54.040]  democratic plan look it up cloward and piven to bankrupt the nation to get rid
[24:54.040 --> 24:59.080]  of capitalism using limited socialism to bankrupt capitalism then you're all
[24:59.080 --> 25:05.280]  slaves so here's AP quarantines at two schools amid measles outbreak and doctor
[25:05.280 --> 25:10.680]  admits it happens from travelers from abroad here it is normally when it comes
[25:10.680 --> 25:15.000]  to measles we do have small outbreaks that happen in the United States but
[25:15.000 --> 25:19.360]  those cases usually happen when travelers from abroad come and bring the
[25:19.360 --> 25:25.360]  illness having said that the more recent generation of parents have not
[25:25.360 --> 25:29.000]  vaccinated as many children so the potential for it to be spread as
[25:29.000 --> 25:33.320]  increased which heightens our fear and now of this year that's the whitewash
[25:33.320 --> 25:36.280]  by AP and I'm gonna show you all the medical records that doesn't protect you
[25:36.280 --> 25:39.800]  from the old strains with the new ones that are coming in just like Native
[25:39.800 --> 25:42.560]  Americans have been around smallpox but they were immune to the one they were
[25:42.560 --> 25:46.000]  used to Europeans showed up until a percent of them because they weren't used
[25:46.000 --> 25:50.480]  to it no matter what damn vaccine there was their bodies weren't ready for it
[25:50.480 --> 25:56.840]  genetically okay let's go to the next one this is Fox News official admits
[25:56.840 --> 26:00.760]  illegal aliens started measles outbreak in New York here it is
[26:00.760 --> 26:05.120]  New York County has declared a state of emergency starting today children not
[26:05.120 --> 26:09.800]  vaccinated against the measles virus are banned from public places so far there
[26:09.800 --> 26:15.600]  are 153 confirmed cases of measles in Rockland County the Rockland County
[26:15.600 --> 26:20.800]  Executive Ed Day joins me now why did you take the step I took the step because
[26:20.800 --> 26:25.160]  we've been battling this for six months six months ago we had seven infected
[26:25.160 --> 26:30.040]  individuals come from overseas to a local community in Rockland County the
[26:30.040 --> 26:33.200]  health department did a wonderful job with the mission of minimizing
[26:33.200 --> 26:38.680]  exposures and maximizing in our immunizations and we let's stop there
[26:38.680 --> 26:42.960]  now let's I'm gonna show you articles where they say the measles shot we have
[26:42.960 --> 26:45.960]  doesn't protect from these third world ones that's different strains doesn't
[26:45.960 --> 26:49.520]  matter though these go take the shot take the shot instead of stopping what's
[26:49.520 --> 26:53.720]  coming in bringing it which is what we did before I'm gonna show you all the
[26:53.720 --> 26:57.400]  numbers but here's the ultra orthodox community on the lowest levels of
[26:57.400 --> 27:02.360]  disease on the lowest levels of crime Jewish folks that don't trust the
[27:02.360 --> 27:06.080]  medical system back to Leviticus 3,000 years ago said don't take somebody's
[27:06.080 --> 27:10.720]  blood inside your body pretty smart don't don't make seed don't do that they
[27:10.720 --> 27:14.640]  won't do it so they're not being forcibly inoculated here it is my you
[27:14.640 --> 27:20.520]  might it's crucial for people understand the measles vaccine works today we are
[27:20.520 --> 27:26.320]  declaring a public health emergency effective immediately this will mandate
[27:26.320 --> 27:32.400]  vaccines for people living in the affected area
[27:33.480 --> 27:37.720]  New York's player public emergency forcefully inoculated so that's enough
[27:37.720 --> 27:42.280]  of that when we come back I'm gonna get into more clips and I'm gonna get into
[27:42.280 --> 27:49.160]  the the the actual insert for the current number one shot in the US mmr2 and
[27:49.160 --> 27:54.040]  I'm gonna show you from an actual insert this comes with the by law with the
[27:54.040 --> 27:58.240]  ampule that has the vaccine not the fact sheet you see on the news they
[27:58.240 --> 28:03.440]  Facebook Twitter YouTube bands anyone showing these even though you can walk
[28:03.440 --> 28:07.520]  into a Walgreens or CVS and say I want the insert they'll come up with a fact

[33:23.600 --> 33:28.200]  cover-ups, you consciously, you want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. Bring in
[33:28.200 --> 33:34.480]  Masters. From Austin, Texas. Broadcasting Worldwide of Disease People. Alex Jones.
[33:34.480 --> 33:41.120]  What are you doing? It's Sunday, April 28, 2019. We are the defense of common
[33:41.120 --> 33:45.000]  sense, the defense of capitalism, the defense of Christianity, the defense of
[33:45.000 --> 33:52.320]  the Republic, the defense of humanity. We are the dreaded Info War. Yes, the
[33:52.320 --> 33:56.880]  enemies cut off many of our avenues to reach new people, but they haven't cut
[33:56.880 --> 34:03.920]  you. Prohuman humans off and you hold all the cards when you take action. Nothing
[34:03.920 --> 34:12.600]  can stop you. But I'll tell you again, at the grocery store yesterday and in the
[34:12.600 --> 34:21.080]  street and at the gas station, it happened twice in the grocery store and it
[34:21.080 --> 34:27.880]  happened in the gas station and then it happened in the street. People said, keep
[34:27.880 --> 34:32.000]  it up, Alex. We love you. We hope you get back on air sooner. Keep it up. We miss
[34:32.000 --> 34:38.440]  you. And each time I said, I'm at infowars.com. I'm at newswars.com. We
[34:38.440 --> 34:42.520]  stream our own videos, our own audio. We're on over 200 radio stations. We're on
[34:42.520 --> 34:46.240]  over 100 cable and TV stations and growing. We're number one on cloud TV,
[34:46.240 --> 34:54.360]  above even OAN that the president watches. And I'm not bragging. But people
[34:54.360 --> 34:58.960]  think of Facebook, YouTube, and Google as the only place that exists in Twitter.
[34:58.960 --> 35:05.640]  Well, fine. In those spaces, right now, the live feeds on infowars.com. And it
[35:05.640 --> 35:09.400]  says, let's put it up there, bio, attack, launch. That's what it is when you know
[35:09.400 --> 35:12.720]  there's these disease masses and you know a certain percentage, according to CDC
[35:12.720 --> 35:18.440]  numbers, has the bubonic plague or TB, drug resistant. And you let these people
[35:18.440 --> 35:22.520]  come in and you let them spread. I just showed you ABC News, Fox News, health
[35:22.520 --> 35:27.760]  department heads saying it was brought in by legal aliens. And then you sit around
[35:27.760 --> 35:32.160]  and you blame Christian groups that don't trust the vaccines or Orthodox
[35:32.160 --> 35:35.000]  Jewish groups that don't trust the vaccines because they've done research
[35:35.000 --> 35:41.440]  and they have the background. You know how highly read the average Christian
[35:41.440 --> 35:45.040]  right wing family is? You know how he read Orthodox Jews are? They know the
[35:45.040 --> 35:50.600]  medical documents. I'm about to show you. I want to be clear. Learned immunity,
[35:50.600 --> 35:54.640]  artificially learned immunity is real. There may be a bad result. There may be
[35:54.640 --> 35:59.440]  a side effect. But if they made clean vaccines, which they can do, I would
[35:59.440 --> 36:03.800]  take them. The problem is it's part of a larger plan. Remember vaccines? They
[36:03.800 --> 36:07.800]  gave black people and poor Appalachian whites that had syphilis in them for 45
[36:07.800 --> 36:13.800]  years to ski. Went on all over the world. I was on Joe Rogan's podcast, second
[36:13.800 --> 36:18.000]  most downloaded poskads in history, 37 million views right now. He said, oh,
[36:18.000 --> 36:21.200]  that was just black people in Alabama. He wasn't saying put them down. He said,
[36:21.200 --> 36:25.920]  well, yeah, that way that said no. It was in Brazil and it was in all these
[36:25.920 --> 36:29.480]  other Central American countries in South America. He search engine. It saw
[36:29.480 --> 36:35.680]  the Journal of Science and was like, oh my God, it's all true. You can't trust
[36:35.680 --> 36:40.200]  these criminal groups to do this. And the president, when his son got brain
[36:40.200 --> 36:44.200]  damage, came out and said we should investigate vaccines. But now they say
[36:44.200 --> 36:48.880]  no. So that's the pressure that's going on here. But let me show you some
[36:48.880 --> 36:51.640]  stuff you never see. This is from Time Magazine of all places and we
[36:51.640 --> 36:57.520]  researched it 10 years ago when this broke. In Germany, a better vaccine for
[36:57.520 --> 37:02.360]  politicians. They have clean ones where they look at them with electron
[37:02.360 --> 37:09.040]  microscopes and they triple test them. We document cam shot right there. That
[37:09.040 --> 37:13.240]  would be absolutely awesome that we can just aim that camera up there above
[37:13.240 --> 37:17.680]  me right down here. It's like a show TV viewers. Thank you so much. So we're
[37:17.680 --> 37:20.760]  going to be aimed at that now for the next few minutes. Radio listeners just
[37:20.760 --> 37:26.200]  type in in Germany a better vaccine for politicians and it says they have elite
[37:26.200 --> 37:29.880]  vaccines that don't have contaminants for them. Now, why wouldn't that be
[37:29.880 --> 37:38.280]  important? Because again, anything in a vaccine that's added in with the
[37:38.280 --> 37:43.840]  pathogen as an adjuvant or whatever all the studies show causes an autoimmune
[37:43.840 --> 37:51.280]  response. So if they grow it on eggs, you get an egg allergy. If they grow it on
[37:51.280 --> 37:56.440]  fermented wheat, it's one of the ways they do it or on dead babies is one of the
[37:56.440 --> 37:59.600]  big ones or monkey livers or kidneys is one of the big ones. I mean, look into
[37:59.600 --> 38:04.200]  what they grow this stuff on. Imagine being Orthodox Jew where the Bible says
[38:04.200 --> 38:06.880]  if you take anybody else's blood inside your body, go to hell. They're
[38:06.880 --> 38:11.920]  reading this. The point is, is that this is what's happening and that's why all
[38:11.920 --> 38:16.680]  these problems are unfolding. Second class medicine, first Beagle, Germans
[38:16.680 --> 38:21.280]  unhappy with alternative swine flu vaccine for politicians. That was what
[38:21.280 --> 38:25.760]  secret documents came out. The Chinese government, they get their own secret
[38:25.760 --> 38:31.200]  vaccine. See, now you're starting to get in my world of research here. You
[38:31.200 --> 38:36.240]  see, German Chancellor Minister gets special vaccine without soft kill
[38:36.240 --> 38:41.880]  ingredients in full wars.com. Now let's keep moving on here now. We've got
[38:41.880 --> 38:46.920]  1600 people released every day by Homeland Security. Another 5000
[38:46.920 --> 38:51.920]  building up over 100,000 being kept. Corey Booker admits that releasing them
[38:51.920 --> 38:55.440]  will make us less safe, but you do release them and you block Trump getting
[38:55.440 --> 38:59.760]  12 billion to ship these people back. So now they're here giving us over a
[38:59.760 --> 39:03.160]  hundred different diseases, some of which had been totally eradicated in this
[39:03.160 --> 39:07.480]  country. Thanks to running water and hygiene. I'm going to show you a graph
[39:07.480 --> 39:11.840]  coming up in a moment from the CDC before vaccines even started running
[39:11.840 --> 39:13.800]  water and detergent started.
[39:16.160 --> 39:22.000]  And we started processing food, which has gone too far, but it was good. We
[39:22.000 --> 39:26.560]  processed it. Then pathogenic diseases went down to almost zero. I'm going to
[39:26.560 --> 39:30.200]  show you. Once vaccines actually got introduced, it went back up some. Oh,
[39:30.200 --> 39:34.920]  yeah. So there's over 1000 quarantined for measles in LA universities, but the
[39:34.920 --> 39:39.000]  border is open. So it's like you got a castle and the disease is coming in
[39:39.000 --> 39:42.320]  through the lower drawbridge and the main gate, but you go have guards aim
[39:42.320 --> 39:45.920]  their spears at someone who's already gotten sick from who you let in the
[39:45.920 --> 39:49.400]  drawbridge. And now all these new people a thousand times the threat are
[39:49.400 --> 39:53.920]  flooding in every day, but you're going to go quarantine people at colleges and
[39:53.920 --> 39:59.440]  make them get vaccines for a measles variety. They're not even protected
[39:59.440 --> 39:59.720]  from
[40:02.120 --> 40:06.440]  notes from the field measles outbreak in the United States immigration and
[40:06.440 --> 40:11.120]  customs enforcement facility. CDC from three years ago found almost all new
[40:11.120 --> 40:17.480]  measles in the US CDC.gov were caused by illegal aliens. Look it up. Why
[40:17.480 --> 40:22.640]  Japan banned MMR daily male massive brain damage, massive autoimmune problems
[40:23.360 --> 40:27.720]  proposed new Texas law would demand safety studies for vaccines. Oh, there
[40:27.720 --> 40:31.320]  are no safety studies. They're given liability protection and secrecy in
[40:31.320 --> 40:32.480]  1984.
[40:34.000 --> 40:39.480]  Everything we know about patient zero ABC News patient zero was an illegal
[40:39.480 --> 40:41.080]  alien that came to New York.
[40:43.680 --> 40:47.280]  Nearly 200 people in Texas detention facility have contracted mumps from
[40:47.280 --> 40:52.080]  themselves. Measles outbreak adds to argument to secure US border representative
[40:52.080 --> 40:53.400]  Hayworth says
[40:54.280 --> 40:59.400]  rubella vaccine developer Dr Stanley Plotkin admits vaccines cause food
[40:59.400 --> 41:05.000]  allergies, asthma, autism and autoimmune disorders because of contaminants in the
[41:05.000 --> 41:10.760]  vaccines, your body then has a response. If you've got some dead bacteria, dead
[41:10.760 --> 41:15.800]  virus, your body knows how to kick its ass. But your T lymphocytes, white blood
[41:15.800 --> 41:21.200]  cell generals sniff everything else on the dead body and then see it as an
[41:21.200 --> 41:26.000]  enemy. And your body starts thinking everything from milk to eggs to wheat to
[41:26.000 --> 41:32.960]  your mama's milk is evil. And your body just goes I'm under attack. Good God. If
[41:32.960 --> 41:37.120]  the Jews 3000 years ago knew not to inject somebody else's blood into
[41:37.120 --> 41:43.000]  themselves. Can we figure it out? Probably not. Probably not. Because
[41:43.000 --> 41:46.480]  that's what's in these vaccines. They're grown on dead babies. Most of them
[41:47.880 --> 41:51.640]  rubella vaccine developer the head of the development program came out and
[41:51.640 --> 41:52.880]  said it's causing it all.
[41:54.360 --> 41:57.840]  And it goes on and on around 700 children reportedly fell sick of a polio
[41:57.840 --> 41:58.720]  vaccine in
[41:59.720 --> 42:03.920]  feshwar. Mom asked why are six month old infant died of getting six vaccines
[42:03.920 --> 42:09.160]  at once. Even snopes admits that the CDC admits 98 million Americans got
[42:09.160 --> 42:15.720]  cancer from the polio shot that had live cancer viruses SV 40 in it. Teen girl
[42:15.720 --> 42:21.080]  paralyzed by HPV vaccine in battle for therapy to save her life. Quarantine US
[42:21.080 --> 42:26.800]  Navy ship destroys herd immunity myth. All of them got mumps on the ship.
[42:26.800 --> 42:30.480]  Quarantine it for more than six months. They all have the shot and got it from
[42:30.480 --> 42:35.440]  the shot. Parents accused CDC of not reporting children's death from polio
[42:35.440 --> 42:38.400]  like Oh, I haven't gotten to all of it yet. I want to show you the graph when
[42:38.400 --> 42:42.800]  we come back of how it was hygiene that killed all these diseases. And now
[42:42.800 --> 42:45.720]  they're back with open borders where we don't have hygiene. And then I'm going
[42:45.720 --> 42:50.760]  to play you a clip from the 12th monkey about how they're literally using
[42:51.160 --> 42:55.760]  infiction now in reality is human carriers for bio warfare. Our country's
[42:55.760 --> 42:58.320]  being hit by bio warfare terrorism.
[42:59.760 --> 43:03.800]  You know, the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong 45 is that I
[43:03.800 --> 43:06.520]  won't be there for my children someday. That's why I need to make them strong
[43:06.520 --> 43:11.400]  now. Now I can be there for my children. Now I can make them strong. Now I can
[43:11.400 --> 43:15.080]  instruct them. Now I can teach them what I've learned, but not once I'm gone.
[43:15.080 --> 43:17.440]  You think of this digital age, your words going forever, but now they're
[43:17.440 --> 43:21.120]  even better getting rid of what you said they were before. It's so much easier
[43:21.120 --> 43:25.400]  to burn video or text or languages now that we have high tech book burning,
[43:25.400 --> 43:30.400]  isn't it? But I have joined my will to the resistance. I can't be destroyed now.
[43:30.400 --> 43:34.360]  As long as I realize I've done right and the longer the people know the truth
[43:34.360 --> 43:38.560]  and you can't be destroyed either, as long as you bind yourself to something
[43:38.560 --> 43:42.600]  and commit to it and go through the fire for it, there is a magic that then
[43:42.600 --> 43:47.160]  takes place, the transcend space and time when you commit the award of mouth or
[43:47.160 --> 43:51.520]  to pray for us or to spread our articles and videos. That overrides everything
[43:51.520 --> 43:55.880]  the enemy's doing. So please now commit to support info wars, however you can

[46:59.000 --> 47:28.280]  All right. Alex Jones here back live. I get pretty fired up. I get pretty angry
[47:28.280 --> 47:32.560]  about open borders for the first time in our history. No screening for diseases.
[47:32.560 --> 47:39.680]  You study old Spanish law or Chinese law or British law or French law. We had a
[47:39.680 --> 47:46.360]  passport. It wasn't even so much about the paperwork you had. It was about being
[47:46.360 --> 47:50.920]  checked by a doctor before they let you into the country to make sure nobody had
[47:50.920 --> 47:57.560]  big boils on their arms or people weren't dying. And by law, if you had plague on
[47:57.560 --> 48:03.320]  your ship, you had to put up a white flag with a black spot on it. And if you
[48:03.320 --> 48:07.160]  didn't, this was in Asia, you name it, the captain and others would be executed.
[48:07.160 --> 48:13.600]  If you tried to land a ship in ancient Japan or ancient China or ancient
[48:13.600 --> 48:20.960]  Philippines or ancient Spain or ancient England, you would be killed if you
[48:20.960 --> 48:25.760]  brought plague and didn't tell people. If you told them they would direct you to
[48:25.760 --> 48:30.560]  a little island or an area, they would send physicians in the West. In Japan or
[48:30.560 --> 48:34.120]  China, they'd just burn you and kill you regardless. Now that's in the history
[48:34.120 --> 48:39.440]  box. You know, look it up. Look up the naval flag for plague. It's a black spot
[48:39.440 --> 48:45.320]  or a black diamond on a white flag. But now, oh, we just open our borders up and
[48:45.320 --> 48:49.880]  everybody comes in and then when it spreads, oh, you that haven't taken all
[48:49.880 --> 48:55.760]  the vaccines, you're to blame. I'm going to go over some more of these documents
[48:55.760 --> 48:57.920]  and then I'm going to get to a bunch of other news the next hour. But
[49:00.440 --> 49:05.880]  1600 people a day are released. The head of the board of patrol pointed out just
[49:05.880 --> 49:10.640]  two weeks ago that the previous record in El Paso was 3,000 a day showing up.
[49:10.640 --> 49:16.560]  It's 15,000 a day there. The leftist lawyers are there bitching when they
[49:16.560 --> 49:21.560]  then keep them in parks and open their tents and feed them. And the judges say
[49:21.600 --> 49:27.280]  release them. The ones tested, they just go and that's who they're catching. And
[49:27.280 --> 49:28.440]  then right wingers like
[49:31.120 --> 49:34.960]  and culture blame Trump and say he's selling out. He's not a dictator.
[49:35.000 --> 49:40.520]  Congress wouldn't pass the funding. Trump's trying to stop it. And if
[49:40.520 --> 49:44.800]  Trump's in the wrong, I'll go after him. I'll do that next hour where he came
[49:44.800 --> 49:48.440]  out and said, Oh, take your measles shot. Well, Trump, I've gotten articles from
[49:48.440 --> 49:51.960]  the CDC admitting it's the wrong mutation and doesn't protect you from
[49:51.960 --> 49:54.160]  these new measles mutations. Damn it.
[49:59.960 --> 50:04.920]  Trump's not perfect. Nobody else. Let me just say this briefly. If listeners
[50:04.920 --> 50:09.720]  understand the war we're in, they'll take action. If you don't find that your
[50:09.720 --> 50:10.240]  decision,
[50:10.240 --> 50:14.680]  because it's really up to you whether you've seen the track record of what
[50:14.680 --> 50:18.680]  we've done. And I know there are key listeners out there that have supported
[50:18.680 --> 50:23.440]  us through hell and high water. And I absolutely commit to you and thank
[50:23.440 --> 50:24.400]  you. But let me tell you,
[50:26.480 --> 50:31.320]  I know our listeners are smart and it's very frustrating to have people
[50:31.320 --> 50:33.560]  everywhere I go say I wish you were still on air.
[50:33.560 --> 50:39.280]  I told you, hadn't happened today. It happened three or four times yesterday.
[50:40.280 --> 50:43.640]  Can't wait to your back on air, Alex. Can't wait to the unbanned. You wish I
[50:43.640 --> 50:47.360]  could still catch your show. We're on over 200 radio stations. We're on over
[50:47.360 --> 50:51.680]  100 cable and TV stations. We have more traffic than ever to info wars.com and
[50:51.680 --> 50:55.520]  news wars.com. It's like saying to Drudge, Drudge, we wish you were still had a
[50:55.520 --> 50:59.320]  website. But see, Drudge has been smart. He's always made it about his one site.
[50:59.360 --> 51:02.560]  And that's it. He was here three years ago. He warned me. He said, You need to
[51:02.560 --> 51:05.480]  get away from all this now. They're going to ban you in a couple of years. You
[51:05.480 --> 51:10.240]  got to make it about your site now while you still got to pull. And we did
[51:10.240 --> 51:14.320]  that to a great extent, but I just want to warn people about the bio weapon
[51:14.320 --> 51:15.720]  plague and all that's happening.
[51:19.720 --> 51:23.080]  And these are smart people for a race, color and creator run to and I say,
[51:23.080 --> 51:27.480]  listen, I'm still in info wars.com. I'm still in his words.com. So the viewers
[51:27.480 --> 51:29.560]  that are smart enough to know we're still on air.
[51:29.560 --> 51:36.840]  It's up to you to tell everybody. Hey, Alex Jones is still on air info wars.com.
[51:37.400 --> 51:42.480]  Hear the forbidden show info wars.com. If you just do that, we are their bane.
[51:42.520 --> 51:47.680]  They hate us. They can't stand us. They want to shut down because we're laying
[51:47.680 --> 51:52.480]  it out because of you. Just get aggressive. Folks are putting up billboards
[51:52.480 --> 51:55.880]  for us across the country. Great. Do it. Put it on your car. Call in the talk
[51:55.880 --> 52:00.160]  radio. Call the C span. Whatever you do realize, they want to shut down and
[52:00.160 --> 52:04.960]  also realize whatever the products are, t shirts, books, films, water filtration,
[52:04.960 --> 52:09.760]  air filtration, the supplements are the best new tropics, the best products X

[52:21.520 --> 52:24.240]  special tomorrow because we're running out of brain force plus the amazing

[52:47.280 --> 52:51.600]  Point is this is a real war. Ladies and gentlemen, it takes money to fund it.
[52:51.600 --> 52:56.600]  I had the globalist and I haven't really ragged about this. It's, it's, it's
[52:56.600 --> 53:00.880]  $10 million a year. Wouldn't fund this operation now, but I got offered by the
[53:00.880 --> 53:05.120]  biggest networks, the biggest syndicators because they know, they know not
[53:05.120 --> 53:08.480]  talent, but they know resistance when they see it. They offer me a million
[53:08.480 --> 53:12.280]  bucks a year, $3 million a year, $10 million a year. That's money act.
[53:12.280 --> 53:15.080]  That's not like selling a product, keeping part of it and not having an
[53:15.080 --> 53:18.680]  overhead. That's you get all the money. I don't give a rat's ass about money
[53:18.680 --> 53:24.400]  for money. Say I care about money as a weapon to use against the globalist
[53:24.400 --> 53:28.560]  and I need it to prosecute this war. So don't sit on the sideline, get in
[53:28.560 --> 53:33.880]  there and get the fish oil, get the beyond Tangy Tangerine products we've
[53:33.880 --> 53:38.080]  got in foreshore.com. Just get them all. Whatever you do, take action today.
[53:39.320 --> 53:42.880]  All right, I'm going to get to more of the scientific documents for another
[53:42.880 --> 53:45.320]  segment or two. And then you're, and then a bunch of other news I haven't hit
[53:45.320 --> 53:49.920]  yet, but I'm going to explain this again. The left opens the borders, floods it
[53:49.920 --> 53:53.240]  on purpose with the UN. The Pope gives money to do it. That's in the news.
[53:54.200 --> 53:57.840]  It's all happening. The disease is pouring in.
[53:59.680 --> 54:04.680]  And we're told that it's our fault because we haven't gotten all their
[54:04.680 --> 54:08.880]  deadly shots and all their contaminated shots and their liability
[54:08.880 --> 54:12.680]  protection shots. When they're the ones bringing the illegals in and then you
[54:12.680 --> 54:15.040]  go look at all the health departments, they're telling the truth. They go,
[54:15.040 --> 54:19.280]  this is being brought in by legal aliens. And it's a new, new strains of all
[54:19.280 --> 54:23.000]  these diseases. It's not just measles. Measles is the least of your problem.
[54:24.480 --> 54:27.080]  Drug resistant TB. There's no vaccine for that.
[54:28.800 --> 54:35.160]  Super hardcore A, B of C hepatitis and hundreds of other really nasty things
[54:35.160 --> 54:41.280]  like wet leprosy. That means communicable and bubonic plague, man. It's
[54:41.280 --> 54:47.000]  real. All sorts of listen, listen, everyone I know that has children. I've
[54:47.000 --> 54:52.040]  got four. So my crew's got five, six apiece. These kids are never sick. These
[54:52.040 --> 54:53.000]  kids are super healthy.
[54:54.200 --> 54:57.840]  We know people burying kids, not in this office, but other people. Everybody's
[54:57.840 --> 55:03.880]  got super weaponized, pertussis, even if you had the vaccine. It's pouring in.
[55:03.880 --> 55:08.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's admitted, but it's a footnote and we've got to raise
[55:08.440 --> 55:13.720]  the alarm of what's causing it. They're chopping our legs off. The Democrats
[55:13.720 --> 55:16.080]  want to give you a bandaid of an affords inoculation.
[55:18.400 --> 55:22.680]  Now let's go to near future. Bruce Willis film from the nineties, 12 monkeys
[55:22.680 --> 55:26.320]  or the psychotic globalist wants to reduce population and goes around
[55:26.320 --> 55:29.600]  spreading a deadly virus. Well, we've got open borders, bringing them in.
[55:29.600 --> 55:33.720]  Anyways, that's got to be the big issue and we've got to raise the alarm. Here
[55:33.720 --> 55:37.760]  it is. If the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia on December
[55:37.760 --> 55:43.440]  27, 1996, that makes us know that it was released in Philadelphia probably on
[55:43.440 --> 55:49.680]  December 13th, 1996, and we'll see sequentially after that in San Francisco,
[55:49.680 --> 55:58.040]  New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, uh, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
[55:58.040 --> 56:05.120]  Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, Peking. Some trip you're taking, sir. Is this
[56:05.120 --> 56:12.200]  all in one week? Business. There you see. Also invisible to the naked eye. It
[56:12.200 --> 56:16.200]  doesn't even have an odor.
[56:18.480 --> 56:23.240]  Spreading the bio weapons. Open borders as he spreads a bio weapon that kills
[56:23.240 --> 56:29.240]  100% of humans. This is how a foreign government would bring this in, but we
[56:29.240 --> 56:35.000]  don't even check now. Excuse me, sir. Do you mind letting me have a look at
[56:35.000 --> 56:41.560]  the contents of your bag, please? Please smell those containers of bio weapon.
[56:41.560 --> 56:49.280]  Biological samples. I have the papers right here. I'm gonna have to ask you to open this up, sir.
[56:49.280 --> 56:58.600]  Open it. Open it? Yes, of course. Of course. Biological. Check the papers. It's all
[56:58.600 --> 57:08.880]  proper. A permit. This is a three-day incubation period. Here you go, sir. It's empty. Well, yes,
[57:08.880 --> 57:17.360]  to be sure. It looks empty. I assure you it's not. I assure you it's not. See? Also
[57:17.360 --> 57:27.520]  invisible to the naked eye. It doesn't even have an odor. That's not
[57:27.520 --> 57:33.400]  necessary. There you go. Trying to bring our government down, our economy down,
[57:33.400 --> 57:38.040]  the third world disease people all staged and ready. Now it spreads all over
[57:38.040 --> 57:44.080]  the country. They're just celebrating it all, loving it all. Hour number two
[57:44.080 --> 57:48.680]  straight ahead. This is an emergency alert to everyone to tune in now. We can

[59:52.200 --> 59:57.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:07.880 --> 1:00:09.880]  Excuse me.
[1:00:09.880 --> 1:00:17.880]  It's obscene. All the violence, all the lunacy. Shooting's even at airports now.
[1:00:17.880 --> 1:00:24.880]  You might say that we're the next endangered species. Human beings.
[1:00:26.880 --> 1:00:33.880]  I think you're right, man. I think you hit the nail on the head.
[1:00:33.880 --> 1:00:38.880]  Jones is my name.
[1:00:41.880 --> 1:00:45.880]  I'm an insurance.
[1:00:51.880 --> 1:00:55.880]  All you human haters are going to get a chance to die under the new
[1:00:55.880 --> 1:01:00.880]  silicone and bloodless takeover. This is what you want.
[1:01:00.880 --> 1:01:07.880]  All right, here's the deal. I've covered one stack of my news partially.
[1:01:07.880 --> 1:01:13.880]  I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve,
[1:01:13.880 --> 1:01:19.880]  thirteen other stacks and all these video clips, but I specifically want to hear
[1:01:19.880 --> 1:01:23.880]  from serious callers on this Sunday show for a few seconds before I hit these
[1:01:23.880 --> 1:01:28.880]  when we come back about that's not a sensational headline.
[1:01:28.880 --> 1:01:32.880]  Terrorists launch bio attacks on the U.S. The Democrats, the deep state.
[1:01:32.880 --> 1:01:36.880]  They form the U.N. facilities. They form the refugee centers.
[1:01:36.880 --> 1:01:39.880]  They use State Department money. They bring in unwashed disease populations.
[1:01:39.880 --> 1:01:43.880]  They spread it. It bankrupts the hospitals and then they tell all of us
[1:01:43.880 --> 1:01:47.880]  we've got to take vaccines. This is outrageous.
[1:01:47.880 --> 1:01:51.880]  This is terrorism and we've got to change the subject onto what they've done.
[1:01:51.880 --> 1:01:55.880]  So here's the number. I probably only have time to take five or six good calls
[1:01:55.880 --> 1:01:59.880]  because I've got all this other stuff I want to hit about the arrest of political activists
[1:01:59.880 --> 1:02:03.880]  all over the Western world and the censorship and just a bunch of other
[1:02:03.880 --> 1:02:07.880]  key things, the latest in the synagogue shooting and more.
[1:02:07.880 --> 1:02:15.880]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-ALUX 877-789-2539.
[1:02:15.880 --> 1:02:24.880]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, 877-789-2539 on the subject of the
[1:02:24.880 --> 1:02:29.880]  measles hysteria because the measles might kill 10 people a year.
[1:02:29.880 --> 1:02:33.880]  That sounds terrible, but that's really rare. It's like slipping on banana peels.
[1:02:33.880 --> 1:02:37.880]  But it's being used as the cover for the idea of forced inoculations.
[1:02:37.880 --> 1:02:42.880]  And then there's no discussion of who's bringing in all the illegal aliens,
[1:02:42.880 --> 1:02:48.880]  who's doing all of this and how they're the main cause that we showed the proof.
[1:02:48.880 --> 1:02:52.880]  And God knows what they're putting in the MMR shot that they're pushing it so hard,
[1:02:52.880 --> 1:02:55.880]  just like H1N1, a year after they put it out, they said,
[1:02:55.880 --> 1:03:00.880]  oh, it was actually, we released a reel in the year before to track everybody.
[1:03:00.880 --> 1:03:04.880]  And we had a carrier virus that tested it.
[1:03:04.880 --> 1:03:09.880]  There's a bunch of secret experimentation going on. That's all admitted.
[1:03:09.880 --> 1:03:14.880]  And I just showed you mainstream news where they admit that elite government officials
[1:03:14.880 --> 1:03:18.880]  all over the world get clean vaccines, which still have side effects.
[1:03:18.880 --> 1:03:23.880]  So that's a big deal. So we'll take your phone calls coming up here
[1:03:23.880 --> 1:03:25.880]  on this Sunday show, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:03:25.880 --> 1:03:29.880]  We'll give that number out one more time for folks, specifically on vaccines.
[1:03:29.880 --> 1:03:33.880]  God Almighty, I swear, I'm not going to get any other subject because I want to take your call on this.
[1:03:33.880 --> 1:03:38.880]  877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539.
[1:03:38.880 --> 1:03:41.880]  And we'll take a few of your calls on that.
[1:03:41.880 --> 1:03:46.880]  But first, when we return, I mentioned it, I said it.
[1:03:46.880 --> 1:03:53.880]  The actual MMR, measles, mumps, rubella, Merck shot list.
[1:03:53.880 --> 1:03:59.880]  Thought I'd actually show you what they hope and dread you won't look at because you're going to get it.
[1:03:59.880 --> 1:04:04.880]  Coming up in the insult to your intelligence that you shouldn't be able to look at it.
[1:04:04.880 --> 1:04:07.880]  You shouldn't be able to research it. You shouldn't be able to find out what's in it for yourself.
[1:04:07.880 --> 1:04:12.880]  Well, we believe in you. We believe in your consciousness and your will and your intelligence.
[1:04:12.880 --> 1:04:16.880]  And we honor that will. We honor that intelligence.
[1:04:16.880 --> 1:04:21.880]  Just as we honor our own intelligence and we're not trying to lord over you or dumb you down.
[1:04:21.880 --> 1:04:26.880]  Or add some weird binary weapon system to this so we can play God.
[1:04:26.880 --> 1:04:31.880]  It's all coming up on the other side. All I ask you to do is realize this is unlike the other shows.
[1:04:31.880 --> 1:04:33.880]  This is the most banned, most hated one.
[1:04:33.880 --> 1:04:37.880]  This is the show to use your human will to spread.
[1:04:37.880 --> 1:04:40.880]  So easy to do. Have you heard about this attack?
[1:04:40.880 --> 1:04:42.880]  I'm glad about show.
[1:04:42.880 --> 1:04:44.880]  You heard about this show that no one's supposed to look at her here.
[1:04:44.880 --> 1:04:46.880]  Why don't you find out what they're really saying?
[1:04:46.880 --> 1:04:48.880]  Here's the link. It's still on the air.
[1:04:48.880 --> 1:04:50.880]  Infowars.com.
[1:04:50.880 --> 1:04:52.880]  News Wars.com.
[1:04:52.880 --> 1:04:53.880]  Tomorrow's News.
[1:04:53.880 --> 1:04:56.880]  Humanity's future today.
[1:04:58.880 --> 1:05:01.880]  Well, I've got some really good news for all the viewers and all the listeners.
[1:05:01.880 --> 1:05:06.880]  This was going to be a big loss because we couldn't get the Deep Earth Crystals anymore for a year and a half fight.
[1:05:06.880 --> 1:05:11.880]  The original producer, the original crystal source, the best atomic iodine in the world.
[1:05:11.880 --> 1:05:13.880]  X-2 is back. We got it.
[1:05:13.880 --> 1:05:15.880]  This deal just happened about a month ago.
[1:05:15.880 --> 1:05:17.880]  We brushed it into production. It's been bottled.
[1:05:17.880 --> 1:05:19.880]  The labels are being put on today.
[1:05:19.880 --> 1:05:24.880]  And then it's going to be on an 18-wheeler right here to Austin from the plant in the Rockies.
[1:05:24.880 --> 1:05:26.880]  And it's going to be shipped out to you.
[1:05:26.880 --> 1:05:28.880]  Be sure to sign up for auto-ship.
[1:05:28.880 --> 1:05:30.880]  Then an additional 10% off.
[1:05:30.880 --> 1:05:34.880]  The 25% off celebration of the fact that we got it back and we're relaunching it.
[1:05:34.880 --> 1:05:36.880]  Research the iodine conspiracy.
[1:05:36.880 --> 1:05:38.880]  Find out why it's so important.
[1:05:38.880 --> 1:05:41.880]  Find out why the globalists don't want you to have the good halogens.
[1:05:41.880 --> 1:05:44.880]  They want you to have the bad halogens at infowarstore.com.
[1:05:44.880 --> 1:05:47.880]  That's the umbrella site, infowarstore.com.
[1:05:47.880 --> 1:05:49.880]  They should write the supplements.
[1:05:49.880 --> 1:05:52.880]  And this is the King Daddy, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:05:52.880 --> 1:05:57.880]  It is X-2 original now back at infowarstore.com.
[1:05:58.880 --> 1:06:00.880]  We've got it.
[1:06:00.880 --> 1:06:05.880]  The first person is coming to you.
[1:06:05.880 --> 1:06:09.880]  Waging war on corruption.
[1:06:09.880 --> 1:06:16.880]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[1:06:21.880 --> 1:06:27.880]  I need everybody that's watching at infowarstore.com or newswarstore.com on local radio or TV
[1:06:27.880 --> 1:06:33.880]  to go to infowarstore.com and get the article that has the live view of the show to warn people.
[1:06:33.880 --> 1:06:36.880]  Democrat globalist terrorists have opened up our borders.
[1:06:36.880 --> 1:06:39.880]  They know there's all these disease illegal aliens coming in.
[1:06:39.880 --> 1:06:43.880]  I just played you local health department officials from New York to California
[1:06:43.880 --> 1:06:46.880]  admitting that it's illegal aliens bringing in the measles.
[1:06:46.880 --> 1:06:49.880]  And then we're told we should all be forcibly inoculated.
[1:06:49.880 --> 1:06:56.880]  And that vaccine exemptions should be gotten rid of and that even religious exemptions should be gotten rid of.
[1:06:56.880 --> 1:07:00.880]  Hundreds of vaccines that governments want to put in us should be forced.
[1:07:00.880 --> 1:07:02.880]  It's on newswarstore.com.
[1:07:02.880 --> 1:07:04.880]  It's on infowarstore.com.
[1:07:04.880 --> 1:07:13.880]  Emergency terrorist hit 21 states with lethal biological weapons using human carriers.
[1:07:13.880 --> 1:07:15.880]  Now let me get back to this.
[1:07:15.880 --> 1:07:20.880]  CDC lies about media repeats risk of dying from measles.
[1:07:20.880 --> 1:07:22.880]  Here is blow that up.
[1:07:22.880 --> 1:07:31.880]  CDC's own map of the number of people that have died from the measles from 1900 versus what it is today.
[1:07:31.880 --> 1:07:34.880]  Maybe a few people have died a year versus thousands.
[1:07:34.880 --> 1:07:38.880]  That's because of malnutrition, bad hygiene, no detergent, all that.
[1:07:38.880 --> 1:07:43.880]  But they sit there and they make you believe that it is saved by the vaccines.
[1:07:43.880 --> 1:07:50.880]  Even though if you look by 1964 when people were taking the measles shot, it was already eradicated basically.
[1:07:50.880 --> 1:07:59.880]  This is the third world populations coming in that are causing this on every single front.
[1:07:59.880 --> 1:08:06.880]  But before we go any further, for TV viewers, radio listeners, you can go into any Walgreens or CVS or any government clinic and say,
[1:08:06.880 --> 1:08:14.880]  I want the vaccine drug insert for the measles, mumps, rubella, the flu shot, anything.
[1:08:14.880 --> 1:08:17.880]  And they'll give you a fact sheet and you go, I don't want a fact sheet.
[1:08:17.880 --> 1:08:21.880]  It's like Bible paper. It's very thin.
[1:08:21.880 --> 1:08:26.880]  You want a little folded up. It's folded up the size of like a quarter.
[1:08:26.880 --> 1:08:36.880]  When you unfold it, it's about 14 inches long, about 10 inches tall.
[1:08:36.880 --> 1:08:38.880]  TV viewers can see this.
[1:08:38.880 --> 1:08:40.880]  And man, this is why they fear this broadcast.
[1:08:40.880 --> 1:08:42.880]  Just common sense things like this.
[1:08:42.880 --> 1:08:46.880]  Let's zoom in as best you can please for TV viewers.
[1:08:46.880 --> 1:08:48.880]  Let's do a Dr. McCam shot please.
[1:08:48.880 --> 1:08:51.880]  All right, now right here, zoom in even more please.
[1:08:51.880 --> 1:08:55.880]  This is the Merco current shot.
[1:08:55.880 --> 1:09:05.880]  And this is what it can do. Digestive system, pancreatis, diarrhea, vomiting, nausea,
[1:09:05.880 --> 1:09:09.880]  interconsistent diabetes and cause type one.
[1:09:09.880 --> 1:09:11.880]  They'll call it genetic when you take the shot.
[1:09:11.880 --> 1:09:13.880]  They'll go, oh, what the sugar did it? You have genetic diabetes.
[1:09:13.880 --> 1:09:15.880]  No, they just fried your pancreas.
[1:09:15.880 --> 1:09:18.880]  It goes on to say cause death.
[1:09:18.880 --> 1:09:20.880]  Zoom in on that. The camera goes closer.
[1:09:20.880 --> 1:09:27.880]  Death and it goes through all the different ways it can kill you.
[1:09:27.880 --> 1:09:31.880]  We got to put a better document cam shot in because the one in the other studio goes even closer.
[1:09:31.880 --> 1:09:33.880]  Is that as close as it goes?
[1:09:33.880 --> 1:09:36.880]  Closer as it goes. Well, let's put a better camera in then.
[1:09:36.880 --> 1:09:38.880]  And then we're going backwards to the studio.
[1:09:38.880 --> 1:09:41.880]  I'm not mad. It's just that people can read this for themselves.
[1:09:41.880 --> 1:09:43.880]  Endocrine failure, all of it.
[1:09:43.880 --> 1:09:50.880]  It goes on for page after page. And again, this is Merck and co.
[1:09:50.880 --> 1:09:58.880]  White House, Stanton, New Jersey, 08889 USA, measles, mumps, rubella vaccine.
[1:09:58.880 --> 1:10:01.880]  And it goes through. It can cause death.
[1:10:01.880 --> 1:10:04.880]  It can cause brain damage. It can cause cancer.
[1:10:04.880 --> 1:10:08.880]  It can cause all sorts of things. You can get allergic to all the things.
[1:10:08.880 --> 1:10:11.880]  They admit this here. It can cause narcolepsy.
[1:10:11.880 --> 1:10:18.880]  It can cause epilepsy. Just just just please for you and your family, please go get one of these.
[1:10:18.880 --> 1:10:23.880]  Don't believe me. Go read it for yourself.
[1:10:23.880 --> 1:10:29.880]  So that's what we're dealing with in 2019.
[1:10:29.880 --> 1:10:31.880]  That's what's happening.
[1:10:31.880 --> 1:10:37.880]  And again, every vaccine you take is contaminated with hundreds of different things.
[1:10:37.880 --> 1:10:41.880]  Your body then has an autoimmune response to that because it came in.
[1:10:41.880 --> 1:10:51.880]  The bacteria virus loaded and wrapped bespeckled with whatever it is, eggs or fetal tissue or whatever.
[1:10:51.880 --> 1:10:53.880]  And then you get cancer.
[1:10:53.880 --> 1:10:58.880]  Your body starts having an autoimmune response to your own tissue because they grew a lot of these vaccines on dead babies.
[1:10:58.880 --> 1:11:01.880]  It says that on this vaccine.
[1:11:01.880 --> 1:11:03.880]  Grown on dead babies.
[1:11:03.880 --> 1:11:07.880]  They go, oh, we grew the original viruses on dead babies.
[1:11:07.880 --> 1:11:09.880]  Then we grew the rest on eggs.
[1:11:09.880 --> 1:11:14.880]  It doesn't matter. It carries it over.
[1:11:14.880 --> 1:11:17.880]  Then you got to ask what type of government and system would do this?
[1:11:17.880 --> 1:11:19.880]  Japan has banned all this.
[1:11:19.880 --> 1:11:21.880]  India has been banning it.
[1:11:21.880 --> 1:11:23.880]  China doesn't do all this.
[1:11:23.880 --> 1:11:27.880]  South Korea does. They have the highest instance of autism.
[1:11:27.880 --> 1:11:29.880]  Here's another one.
[1:11:29.880 --> 1:11:32.880]  Fever, seizure, risk from measles containing vaccine.
[1:11:32.880 --> 1:11:35.880]  TDC, it means they can do all that to you and give you the measles.
[1:11:35.880 --> 1:11:42.880]  California builds to a point public health official determined vaccine exemptions to get rid of your exemptions.
[1:11:42.880 --> 1:11:48.880]  Dr. Andrews Emmerman's full album, David, on alleged link in vaccines and autism, U.S. government cover up.
[1:11:48.880 --> 1:11:53.880]  And it goes on and on and on as I showed you earlier.
[1:11:53.880 --> 1:12:01.880]  Meanwhile, President Trump years ago said he thought his son got brain damage from vaccines and thought too many were being given.
[1:12:01.880 --> 1:12:04.880]  It doesn't matter. Let's say vaccines are great. It's all real.
[1:12:04.880 --> 1:12:09.880]  Why leave the border open and bring all these people in with all these diseases?
[1:12:09.880 --> 1:12:15.880]  I saw leftists commenting on the stories we posted on infowars.com and newswars.com with all this disinfo about us,
[1:12:15.880 --> 1:12:22.880]  because they get scared because there's PR operatives for big pharma like Merck
[1:12:22.880 --> 1:12:28.880]  that gave you the HPV vaccine that admittedly killed a bunch of women that took it and little girls.
[1:12:28.880 --> 1:12:32.880]  Or Bayer. They bought Monsanto.
[1:12:32.880 --> 1:12:37.880]  Bayer, it came out in France, Australia and Canada.
[1:12:37.880 --> 1:12:44.880]  For a decade, shipped out factor eight blood clotting product that they knew every shot at HIV and hepatitis and it was a death sentence.
[1:12:44.880 --> 1:12:50.880]  And their own CEOs and executives were in the, pull it up, pull up, factor eight blood scandal Bayer.
[1:12:50.880 --> 1:12:55.880]  Type it into Google, click web, it's old news, it'll come up.
[1:12:55.880 --> 1:12:59.880]  And they said, so what hemophiliacs need to die?
[1:12:59.880 --> 1:13:04.880]  That's the cold blooded attitude of these people.
[1:13:04.880 --> 1:13:09.880]  Amidst the growing measles outbreak in the U.S., Trump just encouraged people to vaccinate their children.
[1:13:09.880 --> 1:13:14.880]  He spent years pushing anti-vax theories with autism being way out.
[1:13:14.880 --> 1:13:18.880]  What do we have to lose by having doctors give small dose vaccines?
[1:13:18.880 --> 1:13:23.880]  Figures via big doses in tiny bodies. That's common sense.
[1:13:23.880 --> 1:13:30.880]  Healthy young children goes to doctor, gets pumped with massive shot of many vaccines, doesn't feel good and changes.
[1:13:30.880 --> 1:13:34.880]  That's a son. Autism, many such cases.
[1:13:34.880 --> 1:13:43.880]  Donald J. Trump. If I were president, I would push for proper vaccinations, but would not allow one-time measles shots to a small child that cannot take them.
[1:13:43.880 --> 1:13:47.880]  Well, that Donald Trump discreet with the new Donald Trump. That's Donald Trump five years ago.
[1:13:47.880 --> 1:13:52.880]  Autism, way up. I believe in vaccinations, but not massive ones at once.
[1:13:52.880 --> 1:14:01.880]  Shots too much for small child to handle. Government should stop now.
[1:14:01.880 --> 1:14:08.880]  So Trump's doing a lot of good on a lot of fronts, but forced inoculations are here, and the issue of Trump isn't that we're not inoculated.
[1:14:08.880 --> 1:14:13.880]  We didn't have measles in mumps anymore in this country. You heard earlier, AP, all of admitting at the doctors.
[1:14:13.880 --> 1:14:18.880]  We open the borders up to the giant third-world population. We're run down.
[1:14:18.880 --> 1:14:21.880]  We don't get enough vitamin C. We don't get enough sunshine.
[1:14:21.880 --> 1:14:32.880]  We need a bunch of processed crap. We're sick, and you bring in giant, unwashed third-world populations from countries filled with every damn disease you can imagine, and what do you expect is going to happen?
[1:14:32.880 --> 1:14:39.880]  We're going to come back to get your calls on this situation as parents, as victims, as citizens, and so much more on the other side.

[1:18:18.880 --> 1:18:24.880]  People who ate certain quail eggs experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[1:18:24.880 --> 1:18:30.880]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research,
[1:18:30.880 --> 1:18:35.880]  a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[1:18:35.880 --> 1:18:39.880]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine.
[1:18:39.880 --> 1:18:49.880]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[1:18:49.880 --> 1:18:52.880]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.

[1:20:18.880 --> 1:20:25.880]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:25.880 --> 1:20:29.880]  You know, I think I'm going to launch a nighttime show and a morning show.
[1:20:29.880 --> 1:20:32.880]  We've got to find the host that can do it right. The opposite of me.
[1:20:32.880 --> 1:20:34.880]  It's my little shut up.
[1:20:34.880 --> 1:20:39.880]  To just open the phones and then just show articles, read the headline and take calls.
[1:20:39.880 --> 1:20:42.880]  Like Washington Journal, but for InfoWars.
[1:20:42.880 --> 1:20:45.880]  That's going to happen the next few months. We're doing it right now. We're interviewing people.
[1:20:45.880 --> 1:20:55.880]  That's coming because these callers, like Brandon in Texas, says Disinformation and Propaganda Act is stopping us covering vaccines.
[1:20:55.880 --> 1:20:58.880]  And again, I've known that. I've not mentioned that.
[1:20:58.880 --> 1:21:02.880]  In there, it says it's Russian propaganda that vaccines can hurt you.
[1:21:02.880 --> 1:21:09.880]  No, it's the damn insert. It says they can kill you like any drug.
[1:21:09.880 --> 1:21:15.880]  And there's a caller mentioning that for months, I've meant to point that out.
[1:21:15.880 --> 1:21:17.880]  And notice the whole Russian gate has been proven to be a fraud.
[1:21:17.880 --> 1:21:20.880]  I'm still being banned and under attack.
[1:21:20.880 --> 1:21:24.880]  And strategically, I've not talked about the stuff that's happening behind the scenes because I just expect it.
[1:21:24.880 --> 1:21:26.880]  I'm not a victim. I'm a warrior.
[1:21:26.880 --> 1:21:30.880]  But let me tell you, they see us as the number one damn threat for a good reason.
[1:21:30.880 --> 1:21:35.880]  We know how to beat the globalists. We've done our own work. We mean business.
[1:21:35.880 --> 1:21:39.880]  And we're not afraid of them. So they're scared. You know, I'm going to go to your calls.
[1:21:39.880 --> 1:21:42.880]  You can call this anecdotal.
[1:21:42.880 --> 1:21:51.880]  I know two people that work in this office who I personally asked to go on air to say by their children and they start getting tears in their eyes and they can't do it.
[1:21:51.880 --> 1:21:53.880]  And I can't blame them.
[1:21:53.880 --> 1:22:00.880]  But I know two people in this office who in the last 10 years, one lost a son, one lost a daughter.
[1:22:00.880 --> 1:22:03.880]  And only one of them is giving me authorization to even tell part of the story on air.
[1:22:03.880 --> 1:22:11.880]  So I'll tell that one of them was a woman in special operations as high level as any woman's ever gone in actual special operations.
[1:22:11.880 --> 1:22:14.880]  Delta Force, you name it, in support of Delta Force.
[1:22:14.880 --> 1:22:21.880]  And they were deployed overseas and they kept giving the two year old vaccines till she died.
[1:22:21.880 --> 1:22:23.880]  That's why the works in this office.
[1:22:23.880 --> 1:22:25.880]  Honourably discharged, defense language school, only arts.
[1:22:25.880 --> 1:22:27.880]  And I shouldn't say more than that.
[1:22:27.880 --> 1:22:29.880]  I just want you to know this is real.
[1:22:29.880 --> 1:22:34.880]  And I can walk across the street, I got her friends worked here 15 years.
[1:22:34.880 --> 1:22:36.880]  Son died of vaccines.
[1:22:36.880 --> 1:22:41.880]  18 months old, got the third round, bit his tongue off, spewing blood out of his face.
[1:22:41.880 --> 1:22:45.880]  Then a coma for two weeks, died.
[1:22:45.880 --> 1:22:47.880]  So let me tell you something, folks.
[1:22:47.880 --> 1:22:49.880]  It didn't just on the damn insert.
[1:22:49.880 --> 1:22:51.880]  My mother was never in the Olympics.
[1:22:51.880 --> 1:22:57.880]  She didn't start competitively swimming until she was 35 because her friend wasn't a gold medal winner from the Olympics.
[1:22:57.880 --> 1:23:03.880]  My mother was beating former Olympic athletes at 45 in long distance swimming.
[1:23:03.880 --> 1:23:08.880]  The University of Texas Masters told all the team going to the nationals to take a flu shot.
[1:23:08.880 --> 1:23:12.880]  My mother lost 30 pounds, almost died and never came back fully.
[1:23:12.880 --> 1:23:20.880]  She's still there, but my mother looked like something out of a joke like German cartoon of a superwoman.
[1:23:20.880 --> 1:23:23.880]  She looked like me basically, okay, as a woman.
[1:23:23.880 --> 1:23:24.880]  It almost killed her.
[1:23:24.880 --> 1:23:26.880]  My dad's brother almost died.
[1:23:26.880 --> 1:23:31.880]  He was in the hospital for three weeks from a tetanus shot.
[1:23:31.880 --> 1:23:39.880]  His testicles, even though he got them in the arms, swole up the size of elephant balls.
[1:23:39.880 --> 1:23:46.880]  Everybody's got those stories and they get up on that damn news and they tell you nobody ever got hurt by nothing.
[1:23:46.880 --> 1:23:55.880]  That's a lie.
[1:23:55.880 --> 1:24:01.880]  Let's go to Brandon in Texas bringing up what Obama signed as an executive war before he left that Trump has not reversed.
[1:24:01.880 --> 1:24:04.880]  The funding ran out, but the groups are still there.
[1:24:04.880 --> 1:24:10.880]  That's one of the things they say, don't, criticizing vaccines illegal, the CIA comes after you.
[1:24:10.880 --> 1:24:13.880]  What do you think's really going on here, Brandon?
[1:24:13.880 --> 1:24:15.880]  Well, thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[1:24:15.880 --> 1:24:16.880]  Exactly that.
[1:24:16.880 --> 1:24:19.880]  And this obviously came before 2016.
[1:24:19.880 --> 1:24:22.880]  I'm just saying how can we counter this medical disinformation, right?
[1:24:22.880 --> 1:24:30.880]  You talk about Hitler took over through the doctors, you know, and it seems like, well, obviously they're killing us, right?
[1:24:30.880 --> 1:24:32.880]  I have an eight-year-old daughter who's a side note.
[1:24:32.880 --> 1:24:37.880]  I didn't tell your call screeners, but she has major food allergies to egg, wheat, and dairy.
[1:24:37.880 --> 1:24:43.880]  And at first I thought it was the GMO, the glyphosates, or the condition of our wheat, eggs, and dairy.
[1:24:43.880 --> 1:24:51.880]  But after listening to your broadcast today, first time it's come up that food allergies and children could be linked to these vaccines because of what it does.
[1:24:51.880 --> 1:24:53.880]  Oh, by the way, sir, I'm not a medical doctor.
[1:24:53.880 --> 1:25:01.880]  If they admit in their studies that they grow these on eggs and they grow these on like a porridge of rotten wheat and other things,
[1:25:01.880 --> 1:25:05.880]  they seem as, quote, safer than animals because you grow it on animal stuff, you know, you get viruses.
[1:25:05.880 --> 1:25:11.880]  Remember the old days of SV 40 and, you know, things like that.
[1:25:11.880 --> 1:25:13.880]  So, yeah, no, that's a fact.
[1:25:13.880 --> 1:25:17.880]  Well, how much do you think this is disinformation versus medical disinformation?
[1:25:17.880 --> 1:25:20.880]  What can we do as citizens?
[1:25:20.880 --> 1:25:21.880]  You know, I know this.
[1:25:21.880 --> 1:25:24.880]  No other drug company has liability protection.
[1:25:24.880 --> 1:25:27.880]  And all the vaccines have a lot of protection for a reason.
[1:25:27.880 --> 1:25:29.880]  They're Trojan horsing it.
[1:25:29.880 --> 1:25:31.880]  And it's their whole precedent.
[1:25:31.880 --> 1:25:40.880]  You know, we have you in your major heads saying we'll use diet injections and junctions to control people.
[1:25:40.880 --> 1:25:49.880]  And all I know is, did you see London Guardians saying the German elite and the Russian elite and the Chinese elite and the US elite get clean vaccines?
[1:25:49.880 --> 1:25:51.880]  Yeah, but there is a difference, obviously.
[1:25:51.880 --> 1:25:53.880]  I bet Bill Gates doesn't do the dirty one.
[1:25:53.880 --> 1:25:56.880]  Oh, they have electron microscopes to make sure.
[1:25:56.880 --> 1:25:57.880]  Damn right.
[1:25:57.880 --> 1:26:01.880]  You can take one bacteria and kill it and inject it to somebody and your body learns to kill it.
[1:26:01.880 --> 1:26:02.880]  And that's probably good.
[1:26:02.880 --> 1:26:03.880]  They don't.
[1:26:03.880 --> 1:26:06.880]  It's it's it's it's whatever they put in.
[1:26:06.880 --> 1:26:13.880]  So, you know what the UN got caught in the nineties and they got caught by Indian doctors who are super smart, obviously,
[1:26:13.880 --> 1:26:16.880]  and African doctors who are smart, who are Western trained.
[1:26:16.880 --> 1:26:22.880]  They were they were noticing that women were being given the tetanus shot, but they added a hormone that is excreted in second trimester.
[1:26:22.880 --> 1:26:24.880]  So all the women were having abortions.
[1:26:24.880 --> 1:26:27.880]  They were adding that hormone with the tetanus shot a little bit of it.
[1:26:27.880 --> 1:26:30.880]  So there'd be an autoimmune response actually to the baby.
[1:26:30.880 --> 1:26:36.880]  And so the baby would be rejected in the in the in the second trimester.
[1:26:36.880 --> 1:26:41.880]  Well, and the doctors themselves are so burned that, you know, you can't bring this up to them there.
[1:26:41.880 --> 1:26:43.880]  They're just they're on a, you know, there.
[1:26:43.880 --> 1:26:53.880]  Well, I've had I agree with you in public because I've had medical doctors pull me aside and say, we were giving children live polio vaccine.
[1:26:53.880 --> 1:26:56.880]  It was banned in the sixties in the early nineties.
[1:26:56.880 --> 1:27:00.880]  And we were giving them human papillomavirus.
[1:27:00.880 --> 1:27:03.880]  We were giving them SV 40 Simeon virus 40.
[1:27:03.880 --> 1:27:10.880]  And and then after this doctor that was he was the biggest owner of pediatric facilities in Austin.
[1:27:10.880 --> 1:27:15.880]  After he told me he got scared and grabbed me and he was a big guy and he said, you better not say my name.
[1:27:15.880 --> 1:27:18.880]  And I pulled my arm away and I said, man, that's your conscious doing that.
[1:27:18.880 --> 1:27:20.880]  Don't you don't need to say your name.
[1:27:20.880 --> 1:27:21.880]  I already know that.
[1:27:21.880 --> 1:27:27.880]  And and that was because I'm like, he came in because he was one of those not anti-vax, but he wouldn't push you if you weren't vaccinating.
[1:27:27.880 --> 1:27:29.880]  And he walked into who I was.
[1:27:29.880 --> 1:27:33.880]  I was on TV and radio and he goes, listen, you know, doctors have to do continuing education.
[1:27:33.880 --> 1:27:41.880]  Your dad's a doctor and I said, yeah, he goes, I volunteered a few years ago at the clinic where before school, all the kids that are vaccinated,
[1:27:41.880 --> 1:27:42.880]  we call him up, give him shots.
[1:27:42.880 --> 1:27:46.880]  He said, I was administering to black children in East Austin.
[1:27:46.880 --> 1:27:49.880]  And he was like shaking when he was like rocking.
[1:27:49.880 --> 1:27:54.880]  He goes, illegal cancer virus vaccine.
[1:27:54.880 --> 1:27:55.880]  And he was saying, huh.
[1:27:55.880 --> 1:27:57.880]  And I said, well, that's OK.
[1:27:57.880 --> 1:27:59.880]  You know, whatever he was, I don't do it anymore.
[1:27:59.880 --> 1:28:02.880]  But then he was having a moment of emotion and literally this big guy grabs by the arm.
[1:28:02.880 --> 1:28:06.880]  He goes, you don't tell anybody my name, though, when you say that.
[1:28:06.880 --> 1:28:10.880]  So imagine the fear of these doctors are under.
[1:28:10.880 --> 1:28:16.880]  Well, my my child and I were combating this lastly here with our X2 and our water filter.
[1:28:16.880 --> 1:28:20.880]  And we're doing what we can, even though we got vaccinated before we knew any better.
[1:28:20.880 --> 1:28:21.880]  You know what I mean?
[1:28:21.880 --> 1:28:23.880]  Brother, here's the deal.
[1:28:23.880 --> 1:28:25.880]  Not all the companies are doing it.
[1:28:25.880 --> 1:28:26.880]  Not all of them are involved in it.
[1:28:26.880 --> 1:28:28.880]  But it is, it is their program.
[1:28:28.880 --> 1:28:30.880]  And it is, it is sick.
[1:28:30.880 --> 1:28:36.880]  But what we know is they're opening the borders to bring any legals that have all these diseases.
[1:28:36.880 --> 1:28:37.880]  That's what matters.
[1:28:37.880 --> 1:28:40.880]  And then they're blaming us for what's happening.
[1:28:40.880 --> 1:28:41.880]  That's the big key.
[1:28:41.880 --> 1:28:43.880]  That's not debatable.
[1:28:43.880 --> 1:28:44.880]  God bless you, Brandon.
[1:28:44.880 --> 1:28:45.880]  More calls straight ahead.
[1:28:45.880 --> 1:28:49.880]  Tell everyone, you know, tune in or submit to death.
[1:28:49.880 --> 1:28:50.880]  We're committed to victory.
[1:28:50.880 --> 1:28:52.880]  What about you?
[1:28:52.880 --> 1:29:08.880]  My leaps and my bounds.
[1:29:08.880 --> 1:29:15.880]  The number one best selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[1:29:15.880 --> 1:29:22.880]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost,
[1:29:22.880 --> 1:29:25.880]  but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[1:29:25.880 --> 1:29:34.880]  We have developed hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[1:29:34.880 --> 1:29:36.880]  There's nothing else like it.
[1:29:36.880 --> 1:29:37.880]  You must experience it.
[1:29:37.880 --> 1:29:39.880]  It is a total game changer.
[1:29:39.880 --> 1:29:44.880]  It comes in easy to use packets to mix in fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[1:29:44.880 --> 1:29:45.880]  Warning, though.
[1:29:45.880 --> 1:29:46.880]  It's very, very strong.
[1:29:46.880 --> 1:29:47.880]  It lasts 10 hours.
[1:29:47.880 --> 1:29:54.880]  So take a half pack at the first time you take it because Turbo Force is named Turbo Force because it will take you into overdrive.
[1:29:54.880 --> 1:29:57.880]  Turbo Force at mforcelife.com.
[1:29:57.880 --> 1:30:00.880]  I want to say Brain Force is great.
[1:30:00.880 --> 1:30:02.880]  I want to say Turbo Force is amazing.
[1:30:02.880 --> 1:30:03.880]  It is.
[1:30:03.880 --> 1:30:07.880]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[1:30:07.880 --> 1:30:09.880]  The fish oil is better than it.
[1:30:09.880 --> 1:30:11.880]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[1:30:11.880 --> 1:30:16.880]  The fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[1:30:16.880 --> 1:30:17.880]  You've got the children's.
[1:30:17.880 --> 1:30:18.880]  You've got the adults.
[1:30:18.880 --> 1:30:19.880]  You've got the krill oil.
[1:30:19.880 --> 1:30:23.880]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[1:30:23.880 --> 1:30:27.880]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best and it'll give you the damn burps.
[1:30:27.880 --> 1:30:28.880]  And I'm sorry.
[1:30:28.880 --> 1:30:30.880]  You want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[1:30:30.880 --> 1:30:31.880]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[1:30:31.880 --> 1:30:32.880]  It's so good.
[1:30:32.880 --> 1:30:33.880]  In my view.
[1:30:33.880 --> 1:30:35.880]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[1:30:35.880 --> 1:30:38.880]  I eat five culottes of krill oil before I go to bed.

[1:31:21.880 --> 1:31:28.880]  I just can't do it.
[1:31:28.880 --> 1:31:37.880]  I just can't lie to you.

[1:34:00.880 --> 1:34:02.880]  Oh, look at this article out of Reuters.
[1:34:02.880 --> 1:34:06.880]  U.S. measles outbreak raises questions about immunity in adults.
[1:34:06.880 --> 1:34:10.880]  All these vaccinated people are getting the measles.
[1:34:10.880 --> 1:34:12.880]  Isn't that interesting?
[1:34:12.880 --> 1:34:16.880]  It's all the illegal aliens, nothing against them, but that's what's happening.
[1:34:16.880 --> 1:34:24.880]  And the media thinks it'll get away with bringing all these people in when all the local health departments say it's illegal aliens doing it and needs to be stopped.
[1:34:24.880 --> 1:34:29.880]  Liberal cities are saying stop it, but it's not being stopped, is it?
[1:34:29.880 --> 1:34:37.880]  Kent, Mark, Efren, Alex, Peter, Chris, Doug, George, Greg, Marcus, Jeff, you're all great callers, but if I took one caller last segment,
[1:34:37.880 --> 1:34:45.880]  we'll never get to all of you before the show's over and Mike Adams comes on with counterthink in the hour after us, loaded for bear, if we don't start moving quick.
[1:34:45.880 --> 1:34:49.880]  Kent, in California, you're on the air. Thank you so much for holding.
[1:34:49.880 --> 1:34:51.880]  Thank you so much for covering this.
[1:34:51.880 --> 1:34:53.880]  Welcome, sir.
[1:34:53.880 --> 1:34:59.880]  So, I am like you. I am banned. I am banned from going to Australia.
[1:34:59.880 --> 1:35:13.880]  I said I'm the world's number one anti-vaxxer. I've written two books about vaccines plague with Dr. Judy Mikevitz, who's a 20 year government scientist and inoculated with Dr. Brian Hooker, who you know from the movie Vax.
[1:35:13.880 --> 1:35:20.880]  And sure, well, even the Australian government had to admit studies that sudden infant death syndrome was vaccines.
[1:35:20.880 --> 1:35:36.880]  Yeah, you know, it is just terrible. And one thing that people don't understand is that when they grow these human viruses and animal tissues, yes, they weaken the human virus, but they're getting a whole bunch of animal viruses back in the vaccines.
[1:35:36.880 --> 1:35:38.880]  And that's something nobody talks about.
[1:35:38.880 --> 1:35:50.880]  But there was just this great study from Italy by Corbella Labs, and they found that in the MMR shot, there was bird virus, horse virus, cow virus, all these terrible things.
[1:35:50.880 --> 1:35:55.880]  So I'm so thankful for you for continuing to cover this issue.
[1:35:55.880 --> 1:36:01.880]  Well, brother, when you mention that, I think I've heard your name. So send us an email, send us to the producers. We should probably get you on as a guest.
[1:36:01.880 --> 1:36:11.880]  What do you make of, they admit it's the illegals bringing it in, but then they just, it's a minor footnote, then they blame people who, quote, haven't had the up to date vaccine.
[1:36:11.880 --> 1:36:17.880]  Then the fine print admits these new strains of measles that are coming in aren't covered by the vaccine.
[1:36:17.880 --> 1:36:26.880]  You know, I'm so happy you brought that up because I think that's so true because we know that measles is not a dangerous disease if you have good nutrition.
[1:36:26.880 --> 1:36:28.880]  We have good nutrition in the United States.
[1:36:28.880 --> 1:36:32.880]  Yeah, it's just a fever and some red spots on you, exactly.
[1:36:32.880 --> 1:36:47.880]  Exactly. And so what we're doing, and I do want to be a guest on your show because we are putting together a program called the Bax Free World because what Robert Kennedy did was showing that there haven't been any studies like they were supposed to do.
[1:36:47.880 --> 1:36:53.880]  Yeah, no safety studies like Texas has introduced. By the way, I love Robert Kennedy for what he's doing.
[1:36:53.880 --> 1:37:01.880]  Trump said he was going to do this vaccine damage study. He said he'd create this board. This is one of the big places Trump has fallen down, I think, and not delivered.
[1:37:01.880 --> 1:37:07.880]  Yeah, and you know, I love Trump and I was so stunned by what he said on Friday.
[1:37:07.880 --> 1:37:13.880]  But we are putting together with Ralph Fusitola, who I know is the vitamin lawyer who's off and on David Night Show.
[1:37:13.880 --> 1:37:19.880]  We're putting together Bax Free World because we need the United States government to follow the rules.
[1:37:19.880 --> 1:37:24.880]  We're not even saying we don't believe that technology can exist. You may disagree. They're giving liability protection.
[1:37:24.880 --> 1:37:26.880]  Thank you, Kent. Let's talk soon.
[1:37:26.880 --> 1:37:32.880]  Got to move quicker to get everybody. Let's talk to Mark in Oregon. These are awesome callers. Mark here on the air. Go ahead.
[1:37:32.880 --> 1:37:34.880]  Good day to you, Alex.
[1:37:34.880 --> 1:37:36.880]  Long time, Mark. And to have you back on.
[1:37:36.880 --> 1:37:42.880]  Thank you, brother. It's always great to hear you.
[1:37:42.880 --> 1:37:46.880]  We've gone through the tipping point, I think, with the hemorrhaging at the border.
[1:37:46.880 --> 1:37:53.880]  Robert of two. Oh, I mean, I mean, I says the border has collapsed and people go, well, that it's Trump's fault and culture.
[1:37:53.880 --> 1:38:00.880]  I wish it was Trump's fault. He tried to get the 12 billion to dam security. He's not a dictator. What are we supposed to do?
[1:38:00.880 --> 1:38:05.880]  Robert of two force vaccinations. I think that's the.
[1:38:05.880 --> 1:38:08.880]  But see, but see, that's the tipping point. They won't defend the border.
[1:38:08.880 --> 1:38:13.880]  So now I'm supposed to have false force inoculations BS, man.
[1:38:13.880 --> 1:38:18.880]  That's the point of the plan. But Alex, there is something that Trump could do.
[1:38:18.880 --> 1:38:26.880]  And there's more than one thing. Phillip. Phillip Rose was on about a month ago when Owen was guest hosting few on the show.
[1:38:26.880 --> 1:38:37.880]  And he gave two different federal statues that absolutely legally allow Trump to stop the catch and release set up.
[1:38:37.880 --> 1:38:44.880]  Oh, no, Trump as commander in chief and do whatever he wants. The emergency declared was a law enforcement emergency, not a commander in chief emergency.
[1:38:44.880 --> 1:38:47.880]  He can absolutely tell folks about those statutes.
[1:38:47.880 --> 1:38:55.880]  Well, I cannot remember them in detail, but I do have the point is he has the power under the Constitution to not do a law enforcement emergency,
[1:38:55.880 --> 1:39:05.880]  but a presidential commander in chief emergency. And if these diseases are an emergency, what what is instead of like saying, oh, we should all take these inoculations.
[1:39:05.880 --> 1:39:10.880]  Trump should say, see the diseases. This is the problem. God bless you, Mark.
[1:39:10.880 --> 1:39:16.880]  Wow. It's all about global depopulation, isn't it?
[1:39:16.880 --> 1:39:20.880]  We got so many callers here.
[1:39:20.880 --> 1:39:25.880]  We got Chris in Kentucky says fighting with his kids doctor over vaccines. They have a right to not take them.
[1:39:25.880 --> 1:39:29.880]  But all the news is like kids have decided they're having congressional testimony.
[1:39:29.880 --> 1:39:36.880]  Kids want to be emancipated by the government. Take the shots. It's the state coming in just like the pedophiles of one of your kids.
[1:39:36.880 --> 1:39:41.880]  Let's talk to Doug in New York, Doug in New Yorker on the air. Go ahead, Doug.
[1:39:41.880 --> 1:39:47.880]  Hi, Alex. It's been a long time trying to get through to your show. I've been following you since about the beginning.
[1:39:47.880 --> 1:39:53.880]  It's the first time and I have some things to share with you. Please make sure your crew puts me back to them.
[1:39:53.880 --> 1:39:59.880]  We're off. I have a big tech story I want to break, but I know we want to focus on the vaccines.
[1:39:59.880 --> 1:40:10.880]  I almost died from a vaccine years ago before I was aware of the danger and I was so sick from that vaccine for a solid month.
[1:40:10.880 --> 1:40:18.880]  And then I had a one week break where I started feeling normal and then I went back to feeling sick again for two weeks.
[1:40:18.880 --> 1:40:23.880]  And after that, I said, no way am I ever going to take a vaccine again.
[1:40:23.880 --> 1:40:26.880]  And then I've got a story with a friend.
[1:40:26.880 --> 1:40:32.880]  Sir, two people in this office, the doctors admitted vaccines killed their children.
[1:40:32.880 --> 1:40:40.880]  They admit it, but they're given liability protection in this government fund and then the news says it doesn't exist.
[1:40:40.880 --> 1:40:50.880]  And I've got a lady friend who had a baby a couple of years back and she was out of it after the birth and they managed to vaccinate the baby.
[1:40:50.880 --> 1:40:54.880]  And she didn't realize what was going on and that baby is autistic now.
[1:40:54.880 --> 1:40:59.880]  She had another baby after that and they were trying to do the same thing again.
[1:40:59.880 --> 1:41:06.880]  And she was really adamant that they don't touch my baby. It's not getting any vaccine.
[1:41:06.880 --> 1:41:14.880]  And so that baby is now thriving. So she has a black and white example in terms of day and night between these two children.
[1:41:14.880 --> 1:41:19.880]  Sir, we've had nurses on. I want to give them back on. Rob do had them on.
[1:41:19.880 --> 1:41:26.880]  This is in the news. Nurses say, oh, the baby's born preemie a month early, two months early.
[1:41:26.880 --> 1:41:28.880]  They're fine. Give them vaccines. They almost all die.
[1:41:28.880 --> 1:41:32.880]  So they're given orders by the hospital, the bioethics board, give them a shot.
[1:41:32.880 --> 1:41:44.880]  They give them the vaccine. The babies die. They resuscitated with defibrillators or with both with breathing apparatus respirator.
[1:41:44.880 --> 1:41:50.880]  We've had the nurses on there. They know what they're doing until six years ago.
[1:41:50.880 --> 1:41:54.880]  You never gave a pregnant woman a vaccine until six years ago.
[1:41:54.880 --> 1:42:00.880]  You never gave a preemie a vaccine. Now they do it to test in front of everyone.
[1:42:00.880 --> 1:42:02.880]  It's pure evil, my friend.
[1:42:02.880 --> 1:42:10.880]  I am a victim of more gallons. I have a deadly disease that killed my partner, my very closest friend of 40 years.
[1:42:10.880 --> 1:42:19.880]  And I'm telling you, I cannot wait until the Michael ZX comes tomorrow along with the, you know, X2 and a whole bunch of other stuff I got.
[1:42:19.880 --> 1:42:21.880]  Because I know it works.
[1:42:21.880 --> 1:42:27.880]  Let me say this with it. Michael ZX, everybody thinks about probiotics because the pesticides, the food, kill your good bacteria.
[1:42:27.880 --> 1:42:30.880]  What about killing the yeast and all the bad stuff?
[1:42:30.880 --> 1:42:37.880]  And I'm telling you, Michael ZX with all the mold out there, with all the weird stuff that's happened with all the yeast.
[1:42:37.880 --> 1:42:43.880]  Absolutely, Michael ZX is so important. It has changed my life. It's changed my family's life.
[1:42:43.880 --> 1:42:45.880]  And yes, it funds our operation.
[1:42:45.880 --> 1:42:50.880]  871 five-star reviews, 96% reviews. This is the big equation.
[1:42:50.880 --> 1:42:55.880]  And notice Bill and Melinda Gates are obsessed with molds and funguses.
[1:42:55.880 --> 1:42:57.880]  And now there was a report two weeks ago.
[1:42:57.880 --> 1:42:59.880]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us.
[1:42:59.880 --> 1:43:02.880]  And it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[1:43:02.880 --> 1:43:10.880]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[1:43:10.880 --> 1:43:15.880]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities. How can I solve that problem?
[1:43:15.880 --> 1:43:29.880]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off the Alexa Pure Breeze groundbreaking iron cluster air filter technology.

[1:47:12.880 --> 1:47:22.880]  Waging war on corruption is the final segment of this Sunday Transmission.
[1:47:22.880 --> 1:47:24.880]  Counter think that Mike Adams comes up the next time.
[1:47:24.880 --> 1:47:29.880]  The Alex Jones show, because there is a war on, or your mind.
[1:47:29.880 --> 1:47:34.880]  Imagine a government and other governments caught all the secret testing, big pharma caught,
[1:47:34.880 --> 1:47:39.880]  not only giving people HIV, with factor 8 and Bayer, this is undebatable.
[1:47:39.880 --> 1:47:42.880]  And now they want you to take hundreds of vaccines.
[1:47:42.880 --> 1:47:46.880]  They want to lie to you and bring in illegal aliens and spread all this garbage.
[1:47:46.880 --> 1:47:51.880]  I always overprepare, overprepare, but I had like 13 other stacks of news I'll cover tomorrow
[1:47:51.880 --> 1:47:57.880]  during the weekday show, 11am, 3pm, David Knight, 8am, with a David Knight show.
[1:47:57.880 --> 1:48:03.880]  Just join us tomorrow at Infowars.com, or local stations across the country.
[1:48:03.880 --> 1:48:08.880]  I have all these reporters being arrested for criticizing Islam in Europe.
[1:48:08.880 --> 1:48:12.880]  I have all these new Islamic members of Congress calling for people to be arrested
[1:48:12.880 --> 1:48:14.880]  to criticize radical Islam.
[1:48:14.880 --> 1:48:18.880]  I have a lot of other wild news that's unfolding.
[1:48:18.880 --> 1:48:19.880]  We'll cover it all tomorrow.
[1:48:19.880 --> 1:48:22.880]  But this vaccine situation is about medical tyranny.
[1:48:22.880 --> 1:48:23.880]  It's about bondage.
[1:48:23.880 --> 1:48:24.880]  It's about lies.
[1:48:24.880 --> 1:48:26.880]  It's about not having medical freedom.
[1:48:26.880 --> 1:48:28.880]  It's really important.
[1:48:28.880 --> 1:48:35.880]  Doug in New York says friends, children became autistic from vaccine.
[1:48:35.880 --> 1:48:38.880]  We already talked to Doug.
[1:48:38.880 --> 1:48:43.880]  So now we're going to go ahead and take another call here from Marcos in Indiana.
[1:48:43.880 --> 1:48:45.880]  His kids are healthy.
[1:48:45.880 --> 1:48:48.880]  His friends, children that are vaccinated are always sick.
[1:48:48.880 --> 1:48:52.880]  Before we go to him, I don't claim to be the most beautiful specimen around,
[1:48:52.880 --> 1:48:54.880]  but I remember what people looked like just 30 years ago.
[1:48:54.880 --> 1:48:59.880]  They could be Hispanic, black, white, and it's TV and it's the weak culture and it's all up.
[1:48:59.880 --> 1:49:05.880]  But you go to the mall or Target today where I went and people look like they're slugs.
[1:49:05.880 --> 1:49:06.880]  They look dead.
[1:49:06.880 --> 1:49:07.880]  They look soft.
[1:49:07.880 --> 1:49:08.880]  They look stupid.
[1:49:08.880 --> 1:49:09.880]  The IQs are dropping.
[1:49:09.880 --> 1:49:10.880]  Cancer is way up.
[1:49:10.880 --> 1:49:13.880]  And a lot of it's the vaccines is the GMO.
[1:49:13.880 --> 1:49:14.880]  This is the depopulation.
[1:49:14.880 --> 1:49:16.880]  It's already happening.
[1:49:16.880 --> 1:49:18.880]  And the globalists say, Jones, just join us.
[1:49:18.880 --> 1:49:20.880]  I've actually had them do it.
[1:49:20.880 --> 1:49:22.880]  They're not going to help these slops.
[1:49:22.880 --> 1:49:28.880]  But my soul says I can't sell the general public out and be with God.
[1:49:28.880 --> 1:49:32.880]  But it's still quite a conundrum.
[1:49:32.880 --> 1:49:34.880]  Marcus in Indiana, you're on the air.
[1:49:34.880 --> 1:49:35.880]  Thanks for holding.
[1:49:35.880 --> 1:49:36.880]  Go ahead.
[1:49:36.880 --> 1:49:37.880]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[1:49:37.880 --> 1:49:38.880]  Welcome.
[1:49:38.880 --> 1:49:39.880]  What's on your mind?
[1:49:39.880 --> 1:49:47.880]  I wanted to make a point about was all the kids, family, kids I went to school with,
[1:49:47.880 --> 1:49:53.880]  the kids are always in and out of, I mean, being admitted for pneumonia, fevers.
[1:49:53.880 --> 1:49:57.880]  I mean, a lot of them are on a weekly basis.
[1:49:57.880 --> 1:50:00.880]  Oh, it's no vaccines destroy your immunity in all the big studies.
[1:50:00.880 --> 1:50:05.880]  Just type in one flu shot lowers your immunity 50% against flu the next year.
[1:50:05.880 --> 1:50:10.880]  That was the CBC, you know, Canadian broadcasting, you know, system a few years ago.
[1:50:10.880 --> 1:50:13.880]  It destroys your immune system.
[1:50:13.880 --> 1:50:14.880]  I'm with you there.
[1:50:14.880 --> 1:50:19.880]  And I mean, you know, even look, I mean, my, I got a five year old and almost a one year old now.
[1:50:19.880 --> 1:50:22.880]  But I mean, just the alertness in my one year old.
[1:50:22.880 --> 1:50:25.880]  I mean, going into what you were saying, looking like zombies.
[1:50:25.880 --> 1:50:27.880]  It's like they're all pale.
[1:50:27.880 --> 1:50:31.880]  I mean, it's unbelievable that my daughter and a year and a half old, my newest daughter,
[1:50:31.880 --> 1:50:36.880]  my youngest daughter, three daughters was speaking in full sentences better than adults.
[1:50:36.880 --> 1:50:39.880]  I mean, yeah, it's crazy.
[1:50:39.880 --> 1:50:42.880]  But yeah, I mean, it's just it blows my mind.
[1:50:42.880 --> 1:50:46.880]  That was how nobody can put the connection to why all these kids are getting sick.
[1:50:46.880 --> 1:50:49.880]  I mean, it, you know, it's an IQ reduction.
[1:50:49.880 --> 1:50:51.880]  It's a globalist IQ reduction.
[1:50:51.880 --> 1:50:54.880]  So where do you think this is going?
[1:50:54.880 --> 1:50:55.880]  I don't know.
[1:50:55.880 --> 1:51:00.880]  It's scary because, you know, people like myself, you know, kids coming up through school.
[1:51:00.880 --> 1:51:04.880]  I mean, it's scary because, you know, like you were saying earlier, they put it on you.
[1:51:04.880 --> 1:51:09.880]  Like, you're the bad people when, you know, we're flooding these illegals in, you know, I mean.
[1:51:09.880 --> 1:51:10.880]  Yeah.
[1:51:10.880 --> 1:51:12.880]  So next time they say, you haven't taken shots, you're bad.
[1:51:12.880 --> 1:51:14.880]  Go, hey, you've had the damn shot.
[1:51:14.880 --> 1:51:16.880]  You're protected, but they know they aren't.
[1:51:16.880 --> 1:51:19.880]  So, so you bring your legals in, you're supposed to protect it.
[1:51:19.880 --> 1:51:20.880]  Leave me the hell alone.
[1:51:20.880 --> 1:51:21.880]  Get back in their face.
[1:51:21.880 --> 1:51:23.880]  God bless you, Marcus.
[1:51:23.880 --> 1:51:24.880]  Alex in Michigan.
[1:51:24.880 --> 1:51:25.880]  Alex in Michigan.
[1:51:25.880 --> 1:51:26.880]  You're on the air.
[1:51:26.880 --> 1:51:27.880]  Go ahead.
[1:51:27.880 --> 1:51:29.880]  Thanks for taking my call.
[1:51:29.880 --> 1:51:30.880]  Alex.
[1:51:30.880 --> 1:51:31.880]  Welcome.
[1:51:31.880 --> 1:51:33.880]  Can you hear me all right?
[1:51:33.880 --> 1:51:35.880]  Loud and clear.
[1:51:35.880 --> 1:51:36.880]  Good.
[1:51:36.880 --> 1:51:44.880]  The globalist eugenicists, they want to push the vaccines for depopulation and also with
[1:51:44.880 --> 1:51:49.880]  the embedded Trojan horse cancer viruses get everyone sick and because big pharma wants
[1:51:49.880 --> 1:51:52.880]  to suck your money dry.
[1:51:52.880 --> 1:51:53.880]  Well, it's beyond that.
[1:51:53.880 --> 1:51:54.880]  It's a soft kill.
[1:51:54.880 --> 1:51:56.880]  Big pharma doesn't do this to China.
[1:51:56.880 --> 1:51:57.880]  They're doing it to us.
[1:51:57.880 --> 1:52:00.880]  This is a military attack.
[1:52:00.880 --> 1:52:01.880]  Exactly.
[1:52:01.880 --> 1:52:05.880]  And they want to suppress real medical technology and cures.
[1:52:05.880 --> 1:52:09.880]  Like, I don't know if you've heard of the banana vaccines or like mushroom vaccines.
[1:52:09.880 --> 1:52:11.880]  So I'm all for that.
[1:52:11.880 --> 1:52:13.880]  A vaccine is just a name of injecting you.
[1:52:13.880 --> 1:52:15.880]  They've got recombinant DNA.
[1:52:15.880 --> 1:52:17.880]  They've got viruses that eat part of your brain.
[1:52:17.880 --> 1:52:20.880]  They've got anti-stress vaccines that attack your brain.
[1:52:20.880 --> 1:52:22.880]  So you never have higher order consciousness.
[1:52:22.880 --> 1:52:23.880]  Yes.
[1:52:23.880 --> 1:52:24.880]  This is the total social control.
[1:52:24.880 --> 1:52:30.880]  They want the precedent set for liability protection to put what big pharma international
[1:52:30.880 --> 1:52:33.880]  companies run by China want to put in your body.
[1:52:33.880 --> 1:52:37.880]  Communist China owns half the companies now and they want to put in Americans bodies what
[1:52:37.880 --> 1:52:40.880]  they want and they don't want Americans asking questions.
[1:52:40.880 --> 1:52:41.880]  That's it.
[1:52:41.880 --> 1:52:42.880]  Exactly.
[1:52:42.880 --> 1:52:44.880]  So what's wrong with that?
[1:52:44.880 --> 1:52:47.880]  Chai comms that take their own Falon Gong Buddhist organs.
[1:52:47.880 --> 1:52:50.880]  When China wants to own Hollywood, do it.
[1:52:50.880 --> 1:52:56.880]  And when China wants to put something in you, it's a sweet little kiss or wants 5G to just
[1:52:56.880 --> 1:52:57.880]  do what they say.
[1:52:57.880 --> 1:52:59.880]  Tim Cook said so.
[1:52:59.880 --> 1:53:00.880]  God bless you.
[1:53:00.880 --> 1:53:05.880]  Alex, just take the chai comms shot and see pretty colors.
[1:53:05.880 --> 1:53:08.880]  They're going to run things now.
[1:53:08.880 --> 1:53:09.880]  You're weak.
[1:53:09.880 --> 1:53:10.880]  You'll take the shots.
[1:53:10.880 --> 1:53:11.880]  Don't worry.
[1:53:11.880 --> 1:53:12.880]  Don't worry.
[1:53:12.880 --> 1:53:14.880]  Let's talk to Chris in Kentucky.
[1:53:14.880 --> 1:53:15.880]  You won't resist.
[1:53:15.880 --> 1:53:17.880]  Chai comms says take it.
[1:53:17.880 --> 1:53:18.880]  You will.
[1:53:18.880 --> 1:53:19.880]  Go ahead, Chris.
[1:53:19.880 --> 1:53:21.880]  You're on the air.
[1:53:21.880 --> 1:53:27.880]  Alex, you've got a live and a delay feed at the same time if you can hear me.
[1:53:27.880 --> 1:53:28.880]  Yep.
[1:53:28.880 --> 1:53:29.880]  I absolutely hear you.
[1:53:29.880 --> 1:53:30.880]  I'm sorry.
[1:53:30.880 --> 1:53:31.880]  Whatever they're feeding you.
[1:53:31.880 --> 1:53:33.880]  I'm getting a lot of complaints, but we're figuring out the new studio now.
[1:53:33.880 --> 1:53:35.880]  We'll figure it out in a few weeks.
[1:53:35.880 --> 1:53:36.880]  Okay.
[1:53:36.880 --> 1:53:41.880]  I'm going to make my statement as best as I can trying to lead through this.
[1:53:41.880 --> 1:53:51.880]  Number one, my local pediatrician just announced our records for my daughter and said basically
[1:53:51.880 --> 1:53:59.880]  go find a new pediatrician after we asked to spread them out, spread our vaccines out,
[1:53:59.880 --> 1:54:02.880]  and just drop just like a rock.
[1:54:02.880 --> 1:54:08.880]  I'm sure that's happening to a lot of people that boys can kind of complain or want to
[1:54:08.880 --> 1:54:10.880]  do things differently than the norm.
[1:54:10.880 --> 1:54:15.880]  No, there's this government secret program that's declassified to give liability protection
[1:54:15.880 --> 1:54:20.880]  for dirty international companies that are foreign owned, German owned, Chinese owned,
[1:54:20.880 --> 1:54:21.880]  whatever they want in your body.
[1:54:21.880 --> 1:54:23.880]  And our government just sits there and puts up with it.
[1:54:23.880 --> 1:54:27.880]  And now Trump says it's a great idea, which is a big strike against Trump.
[1:54:27.880 --> 1:54:28.880]  I had an idea.
[1:54:28.880 --> 1:54:29.880]  I want to run by.
[1:54:29.880 --> 1:54:35.880]  Can we do a FOIA request on the counter and disinformation to see how that money got dispersed?
[1:54:35.880 --> 1:54:37.880]  That's a great idea, brother.
[1:54:37.880 --> 1:54:38.880]  I'm trying as hard as I can.
[1:54:38.880 --> 1:54:39.880]  Everybody should do it.
[1:54:39.880 --> 1:54:40.880]  Others should do it.
[1:54:40.880 --> 1:54:41.880]  Thank you so much for the call, Chris.
[1:54:41.880 --> 1:54:42.880]  Great points.
[1:54:42.880 --> 1:54:46.880]  By the way, I think listeners are probably listening to the Internet delayed versus us live on
[1:54:46.880 --> 1:54:47.880]  air, so that's probably the issue.
[1:54:47.880 --> 1:54:48.880]  These are great callers.
[1:54:48.880 --> 1:54:52.880]  I'll be back tomorrow taking more calls on this subject because we've got to make an issue
[1:54:52.880 --> 1:54:55.880]  about the government willing to forcibly put things in our body.
[1:54:55.880 --> 1:54:56.880]  Thank you, Chris.
[1:54:56.880 --> 1:54:57.880]  Great points.
[1:54:57.880 --> 1:55:00.880]  We've got to make a big deal about this countering foreign disinformation propaganda act.
[1:55:00.880 --> 1:55:05.880]  That's how Obama put $2 billion behind to shut down the free press to file lawsuits against
[1:55:05.880 --> 1:55:06.880]  us.
[1:55:06.880 --> 1:55:09.880]  We've got to go after that right now.
[1:55:09.880 --> 1:55:13.880]  We've got four more callers, and I'm almost done, but I'll try my best.
[1:55:13.880 --> 1:55:14.880]  Jeff in Minneapolis.
[1:55:14.880 --> 1:55:17.880]  Jeff in Minneapolis, you're on the air worldwide.
[1:55:17.880 --> 1:55:18.880]  Thank you, Jeff.
[1:55:18.880 --> 1:55:19.880]  Go ahead.
[1:55:19.880 --> 1:55:20.880]  Hey, Alex.
[1:55:20.880 --> 1:55:21.880]  How are you doing?
[1:55:21.880 --> 1:55:22.880]  I'm all right.
[1:55:22.880 --> 1:55:27.880]  I wanted to bring up a book you've mentioned many times in the past, which is used as Mullen's
[1:55:27.880 --> 1:55:28.880]  Book Murder by Injection.
[1:55:28.880 --> 1:55:32.880]  You really should have a reading list for all your listeners because over the last 19 years,
[1:55:32.880 --> 1:55:37.880]  I probably have half my library has been filled by stuff you've recommended.
[1:55:37.880 --> 1:55:44.880]  But this looks like, to me, just how everything ties in with the satanic ritual, satanic sacrifice
[1:55:44.880 --> 1:55:48.880]  of children, at the same time weaponizing the third world population.
[1:55:48.880 --> 1:55:53.880]  So as those countries collapse, they move them in here, and then the ones that didn't die
[1:55:53.880 --> 1:55:57.880]  from the vaccines are disease-infested and can spread disease.
[1:55:57.880 --> 1:55:59.880]  Oh, you know, it's all eugenics.
[1:55:59.880 --> 1:56:00.880]  It's all satanic.
[1:56:00.880 --> 1:56:01.880]  It's all out in the open.
[1:56:01.880 --> 1:56:02.880]  Social Darwinism.
[1:56:02.880 --> 1:56:03.880]  You're absolutely right.
[1:56:03.880 --> 1:56:08.880]  It's being done on the big stage in front of us, and the media thinks we're so dumb,
[1:56:08.880 --> 1:56:12.880]  they admit the illegal aliens are doing it, but then they've got a shot for you.
[1:56:12.880 --> 1:56:13.880]  Don't worry.
[1:56:13.880 --> 1:56:19.880]  Yeah, I mean, it's scary how all this stuff really actually circles back around satanism
[1:56:19.880 --> 1:56:20.880]  and eugenics.
[1:56:20.880 --> 1:56:21.880]  I mean, that was...
[1:56:21.880 --> 1:56:23.880]  It's all about raw will over humans.
[1:56:23.880 --> 1:56:24.880]  The will to kill people.
[1:56:24.880 --> 1:56:25.880]  Thank you so much.
[1:56:25.880 --> 1:56:27.880]  Peter, George, Greg.
[1:56:27.880 --> 1:56:29.880]  Great job, everybody.
[1:56:29.880 --> 1:56:33.880]  If Peter, George, and Greg call tomorrow, remind folks over there, they'll go to the front
[1:56:33.880 --> 1:56:34.880]  of the line.
[1:56:34.880 --> 1:56:39.880]  I'm on 11 to 3 tomorrow at David Knight's at 8 a.m. in FullWars.com forward slash show.
[1:56:39.880 --> 1:56:43.880]  I've got a bunch of behind the scenes cyber attacks and stuff, so links aren't working
[1:56:43.880 --> 1:56:44.880]  or whatever.
[1:56:44.880 --> 1:56:45.880]  Don't worry.

[1:56:50.880 --> 1:56:54.680]  the articles and the videos or doing your own show or whatever you're going to do.
[1:56:54.680 --> 1:56:59.680]  Nothing can stop you from supporting that local station or from taking the video we have
[1:56:59.680 --> 1:57:04.360]  and uploading it to Twitter or Facebook or your own system and emailing it out.
[1:57:04.360 --> 1:57:07.120]  Nothing can stop you from saying, you've heard him FullWars demonize.
[1:57:07.120 --> 1:57:09.120]  You've heard this guy called the devil.

[1:57:13.760 --> 1:57:16.280]  can't stand is human will and human action.
[1:57:16.280 --> 1:57:19.680]  We will win thanks to you, but this is one hell of a war.

[1:57:31.960 --> 1:57:32.960]  breaking stuff.

[1:57:36.360 --> 1:57:38.880]  because it's so exciting and so amazing.
[1:57:38.880 --> 1:57:41.040]  Nobody said that human liberty would be free.
[1:57:41.040 --> 1:57:45.040]  Nobody said going to the next level would be without competition, but God's with us,

[1:58:02.320 --> 1:58:06.560]  I looked at all the ingredients and they're all organic, root, things like that that I
[1:58:06.560 --> 1:58:09.360]  trust, you know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins.
[1:58:09.360 --> 1:58:12.440]  They don't have things that they say that they have in them and they're often not things
[1:58:12.440 --> 1:58:13.440]  that are natural.
[1:58:13.440 --> 1:58:14.440]  I appreciate that.

[1:58:19.440 --> 1:58:20.440]  It tastes good.
[1:58:20.440 --> 1:58:21.440]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[1:58:21.440 --> 1:58:25.240]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste and you know, it just gives me energy and fuels
[1:58:25.240 --> 1:58:26.240]  me throughout the day.
[1:58:26.240 --> 1:58:27.240]  So I really like it.
