[00:00.000 --> 00:11.360]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:11.360 --> 00:14.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:14.480 --> 00:20.800]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20.800 --> 00:24.040]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:24.040 --> 00:30.720]  We're going to be simulcasting a full three hours of the syndicated radio broadcast live
[00:30.720 --> 00:31.720]  at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:31.720 --> 00:37.680]  And we have no guest today, it's going to be a ton of news, key subjects that affect
[00:37.680 --> 00:43.920]  human society on this planet and our future destiny, and of course your phone calls throughout
[00:43.920 --> 00:47.920]  the full transmission today.
[00:47.920 --> 00:52.120]  Here you can see, via the document cam, if you're watching on prisonplanet.tv, all the
[00:52.120 --> 00:54.600]  different stacks of news.
[00:54.600 --> 00:59.440]  Let me just read to you some of the headlines, and then I'll start borrowing into them after
[00:59.440 --> 01:02.120]  the first segment is over.
[01:02.120 --> 01:08.440]  Singin' In's Sanchez Dead Africans Good for War Against Manufactured Terror.
[01:08.440 --> 01:09.440]  He actually said that.
[01:09.440 --> 01:12.680]  That's Kurt Nemo in FullWars.com, that video clip's coming up.
[01:12.680 --> 01:17.120]  Here's another key article on the same subject by Paul Joseph Watson at prisonplanet.com.
[01:17.120 --> 01:22.400]  Singin' In host calls deadly terror bombings helpful to new world order agenda.
[01:22.400 --> 01:25.560]  You cannot make this type of craziness up.
[01:25.560 --> 01:32.320]  Now here's some other news, FDA panel to review safety of diabetes drug Avandian, causing
[01:32.320 --> 01:35.440]  heart attacks.
[01:35.440 --> 01:37.520]  What drug do they not admit causes heart attacks?
[01:37.520 --> 01:39.080]  They're now admitting Prozac causes it.
[01:39.080 --> 01:41.360]  They knew that in 81 when they approved it.
[01:41.360 --> 01:44.320]  Here's another one, do sweeteners bring on early birth?
[01:44.320 --> 01:47.440]  How fizzy drinks can harm an unborn child?
[01:47.440 --> 01:53.680]  And then it goes on report that the EU research did find that Aspartame does this funny.
[01:53.680 --> 01:59.400]  They failed to approve Aspartame three times in the 1970s, and we've had medical doctors
[01:59.400 --> 02:04.040]  on like Blalock to read the studies to you on air that were conducted by Searle, part
[02:04.040 --> 02:09.800]  of Monsanto, a division, and of course it was headed up by Donald Rumsfeld at the time.
[02:09.800 --> 02:15.680]  And in the Rhesus monkey studies they did, they found massive increases in early births,
[02:15.680 --> 02:21.040]  miscarriages, and then if they fed Aspartame and the milk to the Rhesus monkeys, most of
[02:21.040 --> 02:22.840]  them died.
[02:22.840 --> 02:25.600]  Now of course it's in thousands and thousands of products.
[02:25.600 --> 02:28.480]  Good luck finding sugar candy that doesn't have it added.
[02:28.480 --> 02:31.520]  All part of a new world order treat for you and your family.
[02:31.520 --> 02:33.800]  Oh, but that's not what's important.
[02:33.800 --> 02:38.400]  No, Jesse Jackson's now saying it's racist to criticize LeBron James.
[02:38.400 --> 02:39.960]  That's what's really important.
[02:39.960 --> 02:46.440]  Let's abort 51% of black people and have the liberal NAACP promoting it, but let's not
[02:46.440 --> 02:48.800]  talk bad about LeBron James.
[02:48.800 --> 02:49.800]  Here's another one.
[02:49.800 --> 02:53.520]  FDA nears approval of genetically engineered salmon, and of course they've already had
[02:53.520 --> 02:55.240]  these for more than a decade.
[02:55.240 --> 03:01.480]  They have insect genes mixed with them for some reason, and a Purdue University study
[03:01.480 --> 03:09.320]  using high-tech computer models found that 60% of transgenetic fish bred in a population
[03:09.320 --> 03:14.480]  of 60,000 wild fish, the wild fish would be extinct in 40 generations.
[03:14.480 --> 03:16.400]  So I thought we'd go over that.
[03:16.400 --> 03:18.480]  That's from McClatchy News.
[03:18.480 --> 03:23.040]  You're already eating cloned hog, cloned beef, and of course cloned chicken.
[03:23.040 --> 03:25.880]  Enjoy it, but this is a transgenetic.
[03:25.880 --> 03:28.080]  It's been mixed with other species.
[03:28.080 --> 03:32.280]  Just give themselves cancer from dispensing toxic chemotherapy chemicals.
[03:32.280 --> 03:33.640]  We'll be covering that.
[03:33.640 --> 03:38.120]  Also scientists developed fake genetically engineered blood from the battlefield made
[03:38.120 --> 03:40.760]  from babies' umbilical cords.
[03:40.760 --> 03:45.880]  Of course, that allows massive mutations, but it doesn't matter.
[03:45.880 --> 03:47.080]  Just go ahead and do it.
[03:47.080 --> 03:48.080]  Everything's fine.
[03:48.080 --> 03:50.640]  The government will just cover up what that causes.
[03:50.640 --> 03:56.640]  The havoc that that wreaks, and we'll continue going over all of that stack.
[03:56.640 --> 03:58.160]  That is one stack.
[03:58.160 --> 04:02.680]  I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[04:02.680 --> 04:10.640]  Nine stacks here, ladies and gentlemen, and again, that's just one little stack.
[04:10.640 --> 04:17.240]  And that's not even all the genetic engineering news that came out today, today, today.
[04:17.240 --> 04:21.840]  And in every study, it's wreaking havoc, but this is being done by design, and we will
[04:21.840 --> 04:22.960]  explain it.
[04:22.960 --> 04:27.960]  What did Monsanto say more than a decade ago, in an interview with the National Geographic,
[04:27.960 --> 04:32.800]  they said, our goal is to take over the entire biosphere of the Earth, patent everything,
[04:32.800 --> 04:36.840]  and to have our genetically modified organisms take over the planet.
[04:36.840 --> 04:40.160]  This is playing God, but that's just part of what's coming up today.
[04:40.160 --> 04:44.440]  I'll get into central banks, start to abandon U.S. dollars, CNN, and we'll get into Fidel
[04:44.440 --> 04:48.440]  Castro says World War III and nuclear war is about to begin.
[04:48.440 --> 04:50.760]  They're announcing all over the country, even in major cities.
[04:50.760 --> 04:55.840]  There's one out of NBC that in Oakland, the police will not respond to most crimes due
[04:55.840 --> 04:56.840]  to budget cuts.
[04:56.840 --> 04:58.000]  They will be there writing new tickets.
[04:58.000 --> 05:00.840]  The revenue generation is no more or no stay with us.
[05:00.840 --> 05:05.400]  Alex Jones here with urgent information concerning trendsresearch.com.
[05:05.400 --> 05:10.040]  The Trends Journal distills the voluminous ongoing research of the Trends Research Institute

[05:58.040 --> 06:00.120]  This information is too important to wait.
[06:00.120 --> 06:05.040]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[06:05.040 --> 06:09.320]  Not detergents, but good old fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin Soap Company, a family
[06:09.320 --> 06:11.320]  owned and operated American company.
[06:11.320 --> 06:16.120]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love
[06:16.120 --> 06:18.800]  these products for bath, air, laundry, and dishes.
[06:18.800 --> 06:22.800]  There is nothing like these factory direct, big money saving triple concentrated soaps
[06:22.800 --> 06:23.800]  anywhere.
[06:23.800 --> 06:32.360]  Get a free detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[06:32.360 --> 06:36.320]  Let's talk to the owner of 5star soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[06:36.320 --> 06:43.120]  As a founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[06:43.120 --> 06:47.040]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[06:47.040 --> 06:58.240]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying a one to two month
[06:58.240 --> 06:59.240]  soap sampler.
[06:59.240 --> 07:00.240]  Thank you.
[07:00.240 --> 07:06.280]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[07:06.280 --> 07:11.160]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into
[07:11.160 --> 07:15.160]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[07:15.160 --> 07:19.760]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[07:19.760 --> 07:25.040]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver
[07:25.040 --> 07:31.280]  solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[07:31.280 --> 07:35.600]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now
[07:35.600 --> 07:40.960]  produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[07:40.960 --> 07:46.240]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[07:46.240 --> 07:52.200]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the
[07:52.200 --> 08:06.320]  Silver Lungs Generator, that's www.silverlungs.com.
[08:06.320 --> 08:11.080]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[08:11.080 --> 08:12.080]  You want answers?
[08:12.080 --> 08:21.480]  Well so does he, he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas
[08:21.480 --> 08:22.480]  Alex Jones.
[08:22.480 --> 08:29.240]  Look at this headline out of Liard magazine, Tara Hertz detectors can see through your
[08:29.240 --> 08:35.320]  clothes from a mile away, part of biometric body scanning and weapons detection.
[08:35.320 --> 08:39.840]  Of course I remember Alexander Haig more than a decade ago admitting they have giant blimps
[08:39.840 --> 08:45.640]  they were testing to be tethered over all U.S. cities to Tara Hertz scan your body and
[08:45.640 --> 08:50.600]  people laughed about it even though that's what Alexander Haig said they were planning.
[08:50.600 --> 08:56.160]  Now those blimps are over every major U.S. city and they're now announcing it to the
[08:56.160 --> 09:03.160]  slaves so I'll be discussing this beast grid where they track everyone via body scan, face
[09:03.160 --> 09:08.480]  scan and from above with the image of the top of your head and your shoulders they have
[09:08.480 --> 09:16.840]  a 100% heat resonance biometric system as well, highly classified but in DARPA documents
[09:16.840 --> 09:20.840]  that have come out 15 years ago and about 8 years ago and of course a year and a half
[09:20.840 --> 09:26.200]  ago in Bob Woodward's new book where he talked about the secret weapon they've got in Iraq
[09:26.200 --> 09:30.480]  it is the heat resonance biometric system.
[09:30.480 --> 09:36.400]  This is the type of incredible high tech control grid they've got in place right now.
[09:36.400 --> 09:42.080]  You notice suddenly all over the country they're slapping toll roads on existing roads and
[09:42.080 --> 09:46.280]  people go well there's no toll booths and they say don't worry.
[09:46.280 --> 09:51.200]  You drive on this road we mail you the bill and that's how they're doing it all over
[09:51.200 --> 09:52.200]  central Texas.
[09:52.200 --> 09:55.840]  You just drive on the highway, they've got new toll roads opening where you cannot buy
[09:55.840 --> 09:59.600]  a transponder, you cannot pay cash, you will be scanned.
[09:59.600 --> 10:03.640]  Your license plate will be scanned, you will pay that way and the public's been in such
[10:03.640 --> 10:08.120]  denial I would read government documents 6, 7, 8 years ago about the scanners going
[10:08.120 --> 10:11.440]  in for your license plates and people would send me emails laughing.
[10:11.440 --> 10:17.520]  Well folks are not laughing now so that's also coming up later in the transmission.
[10:17.520 --> 10:25.120]  We are live of course it is the 13th day of July 2010 on this Tuesday edition of course
[10:25.120 --> 10:29.840]  for the first 14 years of the broadcast or so I did 3 hours a day and then about 2 and
[10:29.840 --> 10:35.160]  a half years ago I went to 4 hours a day but because I have completed my new TV studios
[10:35.160 --> 10:39.880]  well I've completed the building and much of the studio I'm preparing to start developing
[10:39.880 --> 10:45.200]  that and I just don't have the time and energy to make films, do the TV show and do 4 hours
[10:45.200 --> 10:49.120]  but we are rebroadcasting the first hour and the 4th hour for stations that are carrying
[10:49.120 --> 10:55.440]  it and I will at least once a week in the future be doing the 4th hour live and sometimes
[10:55.440 --> 11:00.720]  I'll do the entire week in the 4th hour live it's just that we are now starting to migrate
[11:00.720 --> 11:05.640]  over a little bit with our time and energy towards the television end of things and I
[11:05.640 --> 11:11.360]  found that doing a 4th hour takes me about 30 minutes to an hour just to recuperate mentally
[11:11.360 --> 11:13.080]  and get some sugars back in my brain.
[11:13.080 --> 11:18.360]  I mean I feel great after the show I just am psychologically and mentally and spiritually
[11:18.360 --> 11:23.160]  exhausted and then I have to kind of go sit on a couch for about 30 minutes to even get
[11:23.160 --> 11:28.040]  my bearings and there's so much going on so much happening that I've got a hit at the
[11:28.040 --> 11:29.040]  end of the show.
[11:29.040 --> 11:34.280]  I've got to hit things moving into meetings and YouTube videos and prisonplanet.tv videos
[11:34.280 --> 11:40.880]  and the new Chemtrail, Eugenics film and other radio interviews I'm doing that we broke down
[11:40.880 --> 11:46.360]  the analysis and I made the decision to do that but we will be doing the 4th hour on
[11:46.360 --> 11:51.240]  a routine basis for folks that will just be overdrive but it will be offered on the satellites
[11:51.240 --> 11:58.080]  and other systems for stations so key information on that front for prisonplanet.tv viewers
[11:58.080 --> 12:02.720]  and others but we are now going to be simulcasting every day the full three hours just at the
[12:02.720 --> 12:07.360]  start to the finish at prisonplanet.tv and of course that will be archived each day not
[12:07.360 --> 12:13.400]  just the live stream but the archive of this transmission will be posted there for prisonplanet.tv
[12:13.400 --> 12:14.400]  viewers.
[12:14.400 --> 12:22.440]  Okay in the first little segment I got into just some amazing news and information dealing
[12:22.440 --> 12:29.200]  with biotech genetic engineering, genetically engineered cows, pigs, fish, salmon, genetically
[12:29.200 --> 12:31.040]  engineered fake human blood.
[12:31.040 --> 12:33.080]  I want to go over some of the dangers of that.
[12:33.080 --> 12:37.200]  They are now admitting in mainstream news that aspartame does cause miscarriages and
[12:37.200 --> 12:45.040]  lower birth weights since aspartame became popular in the last 29 years since it was
[12:45.040 --> 12:51.280]  approved since that happened in 1981 we have seen birth weights and miscarriages go way
[12:51.280 --> 12:56.920]  up in the entire industrialized world and now there is more major studies on that front
[12:56.920 --> 13:02.040]  so we will be breaking that down for folks coming up.
[13:02.040 --> 13:05.480]  In some of the other news I am going to get into central banks start to abandon the U.S.
[13:05.480 --> 13:11.960]  dollar, Chinese rating agency strips, western nations of AAA status, that is from CNN and
[13:11.960 --> 13:17.080]  the London Telegraph, New York Times, crisis awaits world banks as trillions come due,
[13:17.080 --> 13:23.680]  another headline London Telegraph, secret gold swap has spooked the market, Fox News
[13:23.680 --> 13:28.440]  report a Republican sound warning over the expiration of Bush tax cuts.
[13:28.440 --> 13:31.760]  You think the economy stalled now, wait till those expire.
[13:31.760 --> 13:39.560]  The big crash America plunges into depression, this by Alexander Cockburn, GOP snow, brown
[13:39.560 --> 13:43.200]  back Wall Street overhaul bill, that means to take over the rest of the economy by the
[13:43.200 --> 13:44.200]  crooks.
[13:44.200 --> 13:50.400]  Berlin pushing for European bankruptcy framework with provision for state sovereignty to give
[13:50.400 --> 13:55.080]  help, that zero hedge, they are running for total bankruptcy, that is just some of the
[13:55.080 --> 14:00.680]  news on the economic front, we will be going back over in more detail coming up.
[14:00.680 --> 14:06.880]  Also on the politics stack here, Washington Post, confidence in Obama reaches new low,
[14:06.880 --> 14:15.200]  Washington Post ABC News Poll finds and these are even cook polls but you are talking about
[14:15.200 --> 14:21.400]  roughly a 40% approval rating for the president, here is another one majority of Americans
[14:21.400 --> 14:32.440]  lack faith in Obama poll shows, Reuters, here is one out of the AP Obama poll, opinion poll,
[14:32.440 --> 14:40.800]  public sides with Arizona over U.S. on new immigration law, so that shows all the media
[14:40.800 --> 14:46.640]  spin and disinformation in the hoax they have launched saying it is about racism as completely
[14:46.640 --> 14:53.680]  a failing, also key U.S. Senate panel puts off Supreme Court vote, this is out of AFP
[14:53.680 --> 14:58.360]  but it is seen as largely symbolic because they are just going to vote in the committee
[14:58.360 --> 15:05.520]  a week later for Elena Kagan on July 20th and they have got more than enough votes,
[15:05.520 --> 15:10.760]  all they need is 50 and right now they have at least 58 votes for her to be approved and
[15:10.760 --> 15:14.820]  that just shows you the dire straits we are in and how the United States is being converted
[15:14.820 --> 15:20.240]  into a full fledged oppressive tyranny, we are dying as a free nation as the rest of
[15:20.240 --> 15:24.520]  the world is as well under the same globalist management, this is a woman who openly is
[15:24.520 --> 15:30.680]  anti free speech, openly anti second amendment, openly anti family, openly authoritarian and
[15:30.680 --> 15:34.960]  it will be the worst Supreme Court justice in history, there is no doubt, no one has
[15:34.960 --> 15:39.960]  ever been this bold in saying they can disappear free speech, that is a quote.
[15:39.960 --> 15:44.400]  Even Paul meanwhile is under fire for saying poor in U.S. better off than poor elsewhere
[15:44.400 --> 15:50.640]  citing government studies, I mean how is he under attack for that, I point out that the
[15:50.640 --> 15:58.280]  poor in this country are per capita would be considered wealthy compared to people in
[15:58.280 --> 16:02.480]  Latin America and Africa and poor areas of Asia, there are many areas of the world where
[16:02.480 --> 16:08.400]  people make less than $500 a year and there are some countries, in fact I am with the
[16:08.400 --> 16:15.720]  actual statistics, you guys pull up yearly pay averages nation by nation because I know
[16:15.720 --> 16:21.360]  some nations they make less than $100 a year and that is converted into U.S. dollars and
[16:21.360 --> 16:25.440]  of course the poorest people in the United States are at least getting around $14,000
[16:25.440 --> 16:33.360]  or more in welfare, so this is the way they attack Rand Paul with just absolute garbage.
[16:33.360 --> 16:39.360]  Another key story in the politics section of InfoWars.com, Builderburg corporate media
[16:39.360 --> 16:44.680]  mogul wrote speech for Obama, Paul Joseph Watson, New Revelation emphasized this fact
[16:44.680 --> 16:51.360]  that Obama is nothing more than a sock puppet for the global elite and on Neil Cavuto's
[16:51.360 --> 16:58.160]  program yesterday Mortimer Zuckerman wrote that yes he writes Obama's speeches and also
[16:58.160 --> 17:03.320]  said that Obama is treading water but of course Obama went to that Builderburg meeting and
[17:03.320 --> 17:08.920]  they decided at that meeting that Hillary would step down and be the head of the State
[17:08.920 --> 17:09.920]  Department.
[17:09.920 --> 17:14.400]  We were at that event, we knew where to be there in Virginia, the rest of the media,
[17:14.400 --> 17:18.240]  a new full well where Obama and Hillary were but I played along with the ruse and then
[17:18.240 --> 17:22.240]  after the meeting that next day they announced that Hillary would be stepping down.
[17:22.240 --> 17:26.600]  So just to show you the power of the Builderburg group, very important article there.
[17:26.600 --> 17:32.640]  Another story, Obama to attend groundbreaking for LG Kim plant in the United States and
[17:32.640 --> 17:37.200]  this of course is a South Korean company, you know I've got to say to the South Koreans
[17:37.200 --> 17:42.100]  at least they build Samsung plants in the United States, at least they build chemical
[17:42.100 --> 17:48.240]  plants and other facilities like solar plants in the United States.
[17:48.240 --> 17:52.840]  I would rather stimulus money if we're going to have it go to fully fledged U.S. companies
[17:52.840 --> 17:57.640]  but those really don't exist because of globalization but it could be broken up and given to a group
[17:57.640 --> 18:02.200]  of smaller U.S. companies that exist, there are some smaller companies but this is being
[18:02.200 --> 18:10.280]  criticized and I really don't think that that is something that's fair to do other than
[18:10.280 --> 18:15.480]  the fact that this is globalization but I think kicking the South Koreans around, I
[18:15.480 --> 18:20.520]  mean how about criticizing Obama for giving billions of dollars to move a GM plant to
[18:20.520 --> 18:28.960]  Brazil or GM plants to Russia or Eastern Europe or China, that is very serious but I do have
[18:28.960 --> 18:34.880]  a problem with it being a Korean company but there's much bigger fish to fry and the Koreans
[18:34.880 --> 18:39.440]  of course have a much better liking for the United States than many of these other globalist
[18:39.440 --> 18:41.960]  operation run countries.
[18:41.960 --> 18:48.120]  Michelle Obama rouses in double ACP before vote condemning racist elements of the Tea
[18:48.120 --> 18:53.320]  Party and we have time later I'll play a clip of this but she got up there and said black
[18:53.320 --> 18:58.720]  people are in trouble, black people are being hit hardest by the recession and then basically
[18:58.720 --> 19:04.360]  blame the Tea Party, this is so black people don't become populist so they feel like they
[19:04.360 --> 19:10.080]  can't be part of a move to cut taxes and to have jobs here in the United States and it
[19:10.080 --> 19:17.880]  just reminds me of how before the great society and before black women were paid to not have
[19:17.880 --> 19:24.200]  a man in the house, you had less than 50% illegitimacy and you had very wealthy, affluent
[19:24.200 --> 19:30.440]  black areas in every city who own their own businesses and those are gone now and you
[19:30.440 --> 19:36.920]  have over 90% illegitimacy and of course more than half of black males end up basically
[19:36.920 --> 19:42.600]  spending more than a decade in prison, the numbers are much higher than a half and of
[19:42.600 --> 19:47.880]  course the quote liberal black leaders are there to ensure eugenics are carried out and
[19:47.880 --> 19:53.440]  that more than 51% of blacks are aborted before they ever exist and Obama has massively increased
[19:53.440 --> 19:58.200]  abortion and sterilization funding in Africa but that's okay, they can point their finger
[19:58.200 --> 20:02.360]  at the Tea Party, black people's basic only hope.
[20:02.360 --> 20:06.200]  So you think the mass of Gulf oil leak won't affect the air you breathe?
[20:06.200 --> 20:12.160]  Think again, benzene, a toxic gas emitted from crude oil and a known carcinogen is now airborne
[20:12.160 --> 20:16.240]  traveling hundreds even thousands of miles inland whether you lived near the Gulf or
[20:16.240 --> 20:21.120]  not, benzene and other volatile organic compounds could cause adverse reactions to those living
[20:21.120 --> 20:24.160]  inside your home. NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric

[21:03.120 --> 21:08.280]  government to be the guardians of currency to ensure purity, content, weights and measures
[21:08.280 --> 21:12.760]  of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce. This reinstalled confidence
[21:12.760 --> 21:18.320]  after the demise of the Fiat Continental System. Wisdom being lost with time, the government
[21:18.320 --> 21:22.960]  we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating
[21:22.960 --> 21:27.720]  the largest Fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced. This is not only
[21:27.720 --> 21:32.160]  a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government
[21:32.160 --> 21:36.760]  but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value. Now foreign
[21:36.760 --> 21:40.920]  governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.

[22:01.440 --> 22:06.240]  The question is where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[22:06.240 --> 22:12.160]  What have we got? A republic or a monarchy? A republic is based on a constitution which
[22:12.160 --> 22:16.880]  protects minority rights. Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting
[22:16.880 --> 22:21.400]  on what's for dinner. So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children,
[22:21.400 --> 22:27.600]  our education, our money. We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[22:27.600 --> 22:33.400]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot uprising. We have the facts, we
[22:33.400 --> 22:37.640]  have the constitution, we have the Bill of Rights, we have common law. Knowledge is power

[24:33.240 --> 24:40.200]  today. Okay, let's continue with the stacks here. Let's go ahead and get into the financial
[24:40.200 --> 24:46.200]  group of important news today. And there's even more that we're going to cover later.
[24:46.200 --> 24:51.720]  But let me start getting into this now. Central banks start to abandon the U.S. dollar. How
[24:51.720 --> 24:57.320]  long have we talked about this here on the broadcast? How long have we been criticized
[24:57.320 --> 25:01.280]  for putting out glim and doom? I mean, I've read the Tri-Lateral Commission, the Council
[25:01.280 --> 25:05.600]  on Foreign Relations. I've read what the United Nations has said for more than a decade that
[25:05.600 --> 25:11.600]  they plan to build their world empire with U.S. money and then blame the United States
[25:11.600 --> 25:16.600]  for all the crimes they've committed and then implode our economy and bring it into receivership.
[25:16.600 --> 25:20.440]  The United States cannot be number one if you're going to have a world government. What
[25:20.440 --> 25:25.400]  does Obama said? That part of globalism is that no nation can be wealthier or greater
[25:25.400 --> 25:30.280]  than any other. All must be lowered so the international elite can control society. And
[25:30.280 --> 25:34.160]  what has the news been reporting? The last two days, headlines everywhere. China to be
[25:34.160 --> 25:39.040]  the new engine of the world. China to save the world. China to be the industrialized
[25:39.040 --> 25:44.240]  giant. China to be the new lender. China to be the heart of the new global currency,
[25:44.240 --> 25:48.440]  the cashless SDRs. You'll still have your regional currencies, but it'll be set and
[25:48.440 --> 25:53.480]  predominantly backed by the Chinese. What did the Council on Foreign Relations say over
[25:53.480 --> 25:59.600]  a decade ago? That by 2010 you would see the dawn of the new Chinese century and the end
[25:59.600 --> 26:03.920]  of the United States. Why? Because China has one child policies. They have a police state.
[26:03.920 --> 26:08.440]  They have selective private property only for the elites. They are the model. And now you
[26:08.440 --> 26:14.480]  see the treason. Oh, the answer is a global government backed by China. Oh, the answer,
[26:14.480 --> 26:19.240]  the only economy we've got is China. They're our savior. We've gotten the IMF and World
[26:19.240 --> 26:25.400]  Bank criticizing the United States and criticizing our debt that they literally engineered on
[26:25.400 --> 26:30.280]  record. They create the crisis off of the solution. But the point is we are now here
[26:30.280 --> 26:37.360]  at this point. It is now happening. Central banks start to abandon the US dollar. I guess
[26:37.360 --> 26:41.960]  Gerald Solentes right on his timing. We knew this was coming, but 2010 it looks like it's
[26:41.960 --> 26:47.560]  going to be the year where it all gets announced in 2011 and 12 is when it gets implemented.
[26:47.560 --> 26:52.640]  And that's really all we had left was our dollar being the World Reserve currency. They could
[26:52.640 --> 26:56.960]  just print dollars and you could get cheap Chinese goods. They don't need us anymore.
[26:56.960 --> 27:00.240]  And now they've got all the increased taxes to shut down what's left of the economy and
[27:00.240 --> 27:04.120]  that isn't enough. Each one of these are bullet to our collective heads. They're going to
[27:04.120 --> 27:09.840]  fire another buckshot 12 gauge scatter at point blank range into our head with the carbon
[27:09.840 --> 27:15.080]  taxes that China, India, Mexico and over 100 other countries don't have to implement. Those
[27:15.080 --> 27:22.040]  are global tariffs against us. Global taxes against us only, only the West. Now after
[27:22.040 --> 27:28.640]  all our freedoms are eradicated a few decades from now, there'll be a little industry left.
[27:28.640 --> 27:32.400]  Central banks to start abandoning the US dollar. There's mounting evidence that central banks
[27:32.400 --> 27:37.120]  have little faith in the green back these days. Can we blame them? CNN says, can we
[27:37.120 --> 27:43.760]  blame them? They don't like what happened. They didn't engineer it. They're taking over
[27:43.760 --> 27:51.600]  right now. But again, they care. Here's another one, the Chinese. Oh, Chinese rating agency
[27:51.600 --> 27:58.200]  strips Western nations of AAA status. The Chinese rating agency when they own the majority
[27:58.200 --> 28:05.200]  of your opinion in US debt, they're now globally putting another nail in our coffin. China's
[28:05.200 --> 28:09.400]  leading credit rating agency is stripped America, Britain, Germany and France of their triple
[28:09.400 --> 28:17.040]  A ratings and accused the Anglo-Saxon competitors of ideological bias in favor of the West.
[28:17.040 --> 28:20.800]  That's right. The globalist said everything they could to transfer our welfare and then
[28:20.800 --> 28:26.160]  China gets to be nationalistic and racial and bash whitey. And when it's the big central
[28:26.160 --> 28:31.040]  banks doing that, because again, get rid of the borders of the West, fund every foreign
[28:31.040 --> 28:36.760]  nation bashing white people, get rid of the Western culture that gave us the Magna Carta,
[28:36.760 --> 28:42.360]  get rid of it at all cost. Promote through the media that white people are devils and
[28:42.360 --> 28:49.240]  are demons and that white men are scum and oh, it's sick. Crisis awaits world banks as
[28:49.240 --> 28:56.920]  trillions come due. Ah, the sovereign debt crisis would seem to create worry enough for
[28:56.920 --> 29:03.160]  European banks, but there's another gathering threat that has not gathered much notice.
[29:03.160 --> 29:08.240]  The trillions of dollars in short term borrowing and institutions around the world must repay
[29:08.240 --> 29:14.280]  or roll over in the next two years. Oh, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England
[29:14.280 --> 29:18.600]  and the International Monetary Fund have all recently warned of a looming crunch, especially
[29:18.600 --> 29:22.560]  in Europe, where banks have enough trouble raising money as it is. That means banks,
[29:22.560 --> 29:28.680]  they're going to bankrupt and take over. Oh, here's another one, London Telegraph, secret
[29:28.680 --> 29:36.040]  gold swap has spooked the market. Secret manipulations by the International Bank of Settlements,
[29:36.040 --> 29:40.560]  the OECD and others who try to drive down gold, but they failed again. It's spiking
[29:40.560 --> 29:46.920]  back up. We'll cover this and a lot more when we get back straight ahead. We're gonna also
[29:46.920 --> 29:53.200]  detail what austerity means when you hear them promoting it. We're on the march, the
[29:53.200 --> 30:02.320]  Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network. This is Alex Jones with five
[30:02.320 --> 30:06.940]  good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate
[30:06.940 --> 30:11.480]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energies
[30:11.480 --> 30:16.600]  are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true, total
[30:16.600 --> 30:21.400]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number
[30:21.400 --> 30:26.240]  three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now new
[30:26.240 --> 30:31.060]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather
[30:31.060 --> 30:35.440]  is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from
[30:35.440 --> 30:40.640]  weather related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance
[30:40.640 --> 30:44.080]  and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by
[30:44.080 --> 30:51.080]  Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[30:51.080 --> 30:56.840]  That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com
[30:56.840 --> 31:04.800]  or call 1-877-327-0365. You may be arrested and are subject to other police action.
[31:04.800 --> 31:10.720]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality. It really says
[31:10.720 --> 31:15.640]  that the state is God. The United States has now recognized globally as one of the most
[31:15.640 --> 31:21.120]  impressive police states on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret
[31:21.120 --> 31:27.200]  network of FEMA cams, now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity
[31:27.200 --> 31:31.680]  of government program has established an old powerful shadow state. Police state four
[31:31.680 --> 31:36.280]  chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen. Prepare to enter the

[33:25.360 --> 33:32.720]  Oh, the central bankers are a bad, bad thing. And if we don't get the word out to the world
[33:32.720 --> 33:40.320]  population about what's happening and if we don't rally humanity against this periticism,
[33:40.320 --> 33:49.480]  this global Ponzi scheme that's designed to render us bankrupt and servile, then the conversion
[33:49.480 --> 33:56.760]  from liberty to complete despotism and human oppression will be complete. So I will continue
[33:56.760 --> 34:01.080]  with what's happening with the banking situation. I'll get into Fidel Castro talking about World
[34:01.080 --> 34:07.240]  War III on the horizon. I happen to agree with that analysis. And a lot more is coming

[37:11.160 --> 37:16.520]  minds. And thirdly, it's the trifecta, as they say, all of your purchases of the books,
[37:16.520 --> 37:21.560]  videos, baseball caps, t-shirts, all of it supports this global transmission. You couldn't
[37:21.560 --> 37:29.120]  do it without you, so again, infowars.com for all of that information.
[37:29.120 --> 37:37.840]  Let me continue now where I left off on the financial news. Chinese rating agency strips
[37:37.840 --> 37:47.920]  Western nations of AAA status. The Chinese are saying our countries are going bankrupt.
[37:47.920 --> 37:57.360]  And then as we lose the rating status, you heard the financial expert we had on yesterday,
[37:57.360 --> 38:01.640]  Mr. Schiff, talking about how, and this is so elementary, but the average person just
[38:01.640 --> 38:08.880]  can't grasp it because it is so simple and diabolical, that until 1913, the U.S. government
[38:08.880 --> 38:13.720]  just issued currency, whether they be greenbacks, gold, silver, whatever it was, backed by gold
[38:13.720 --> 38:20.480]  and silver, but they issued the currency as just a mode of exchange, a symbol of exchange
[38:20.480 --> 38:25.320]  so we don't have a barter system so we can grease the skids of the market. And the bankers
[38:25.320 --> 38:30.360]  came in, bought off the politicians, sold it in the media that they owned in the newspapers
[38:30.360 --> 38:34.120]  at the time as something that would get the bankers because the banks have been caught
[38:34.120 --> 38:38.600]  running Ponzi schemes and scams and frauds and a lot of them have been arrested and the
[38:38.600 --> 38:43.680]  public was really mad and there was a big populist movement in the country with William
[38:43.680 --> 38:49.640]  James Bryant and many others. And so they sold it just like they're selling the financial
[38:49.640 --> 38:54.600]  reorganization plan right now as, oh, this will punish the big bankers and Obama, I'm
[38:54.600 --> 38:58.480]  going to punish Wall Street, they're angry about this, let me tell you, the guys that
[38:58.480 --> 39:03.640]  financed him and financed the Republicans. And of course it gives them total power over
[39:03.640 --> 39:07.760]  the entire economy, not just over the currency. And so when the Federal Reserve took over
[39:07.760 --> 39:14.400]  now for a dollar to be created, a dollar of debt is owed to the private shareholders
[39:14.400 --> 39:20.720]  of the Federal Reserve. For the Treasury to print a dollar, a dollar of debt is created.
[39:20.720 --> 39:24.440]  And one caller last week described it as Aladdin's lamp. This is like having an Aladdin's
[39:24.440 --> 39:32.840]  lamp with unlimited wishes. I wish for $10 trillion. And you've got less than 10 banks
[39:32.840 --> 39:37.840]  that are shareholders in the private Federal Reserve. And of course the Bank of England
[39:37.840 --> 39:40.840]  is also a shareholder and there's been a few congressional hearings on that more than
[39:40.840 --> 39:45.520]  50 years ago. And that's the last time we found out who held shares in it. But it's
[39:45.520 --> 39:50.440]  Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, you know, these are the names
[39:50.440 --> 39:54.640]  you know, but those themselves are just commercial bank and brokerage bank and investment bank
[39:54.640 --> 40:01.560]  fronts for these families. An example of that is what three years ago Rex Tillerson was
[40:01.560 --> 40:05.640]  threatened with being removed as the chairman of ExxonMobil by David Rockefeller. And it
[40:05.640 --> 40:09.320]  came out in the news that he showed up at the shareholder meeting and said, you know
[40:09.320 --> 40:13.960]  I'm still the owner of the majority of shares. You will all be fired right now. This board
[40:13.960 --> 40:17.720]  will be fired if you don't come out with a carbon tax. Two days later they came out
[40:17.720 --> 40:22.920]  with a carbon tax and said ExxonMobil endorses global carbon taxes. And we want a tax on
[40:22.920 --> 40:30.080]  well head and a gas pump. We want whatever you want. Rex Tillerson said, yes sir boss.
[40:30.080 --> 40:34.520]  Fact search engine that David Rockefeller goes to ExxonMobil. Let's just show people
[40:34.520 --> 40:38.160]  how they can document all of this. People watch these videos on prisonplanet.tv and
[40:38.160 --> 40:41.480]  YouTube and I see their comments going, this guy's just making this stuff up. There's
[40:41.480 --> 40:45.880]  no way somebody could just have this memory and be here just rattling all this off. Really
[40:45.880 --> 40:52.320]  I'm not that smart. I mean you, you can rattle off baseball scores from 35 years ago. You
[40:52.320 --> 40:56.320]  can rattle off football scores from three or four Super Bowl's ago. You remember the
[40:56.320 --> 41:00.880]  play, you know, when the Titans and the Rams or whatever we're playing in the Titans one
[41:00.880 --> 41:06.520]  and overtime. So do I, I mean, come on, don't, don't give me that. You remember Roger Stallback
[41:06.520 --> 41:11.040]  at a Super Bowl running it in the last five seconds. I mean, don't tell me you can't start
[41:11.040 --> 41:16.360]  remembering serious things and become as focused on real issues as you are on football and
[41:16.360 --> 41:23.120]  baseball and basketball and Lindsay Lohan. Yes, search engine, Rockefeller, Rockefeller,
[41:23.120 --> 41:30.720]  I remember the exact headlines like three years ago, Rockefeller goes to ExxonMobil,
[41:30.720 --> 41:36.720]  shareholders meeting, demands they change view on global warming. The headline was something
[41:36.720 --> 41:42.280]  like that. And you can see who really owns all of this. Okay, it's less than 10 families
[41:42.280 --> 41:48.040]  that pretty much dominate the U.S. less than 15 or so worldwide. And this is how they operate.
[41:48.040 --> 41:53.000]  You know, it's the Lee families run China for 500 years and they still run it. All right,
[41:53.000 --> 41:59.560]  let's continue here. Chinese rating agency strips Western nations of triple a status.
[41:59.560 --> 42:04.200]  China's lending credit rating agency is stripped America, Britain, Germany and France of triple
[42:04.200 --> 42:08.480]  a rating accusing Anglo sacks and competitors are not competitors. They're globalists teamed
[42:08.480 --> 42:12.880]  up with you a virological bias in favor of the West. And of course, that works well with
[42:12.880 --> 42:16.280]  the Chinese public hyping them up to rally around their corrupt government because their
[42:16.280 --> 42:21.920]  government bashes the West. It's now declassified as of about a decade ago. And it's even on
[42:21.920 --> 42:26.980]  the history channel. I can't believe they admitted that the CIA actually double crossed
[42:26.980 --> 42:32.240]  Shane Kaeshek in 49 and put Mount Satan into power. There was never a split. The United
[42:32.240 --> 42:36.200]  States was allied with China and World War Two against Japan. The United States for a
[42:36.200 --> 42:42.600]  full year before Pearl Harbor had Marines, aviators, Army aviators and others in a private
[42:42.600 --> 42:47.720]  cohort with hundreds of aircraft of flying tigers and other groups attacking the Japanese.
[42:47.720 --> 42:51.120]  I'm not defending the Imperial Japanese. The point is the Japanese said this is an act
[42:51.120 --> 42:55.760]  of war. The U.S. knew they were going to attack Pearl Harbor and ordered them to stand down.
[42:55.760 --> 43:02.720]  You guys didn't find the David Rockefeller thing? You know, mastermind Watson will be
[43:02.720 --> 43:06.200]  able. You guys are the best, but even when I can't find something Watson can. Rockefeller
[43:06.200 --> 43:12.920]  seek change at Exxon New York Times. Here it is 2008. So you did find one. Good job.
[43:12.920 --> 43:16.360]  There it is. You found it. Let's pull up something for them because they won't believe me about
[43:16.360 --> 43:23.760]  Pearl Harbor. It was in the Honolulu advertiser a week before that the Japanese would attack
[43:23.760 --> 43:29.720]  on the morning of December 7th. And everybody knew and the generals and admirals tried to
[43:29.720 --> 43:33.480]  warn people and were told to stand down and let it happen. And that's been declassified.
[43:33.480 --> 43:37.200]  The purple and blue coat have been broken and they knew that just just search engine
[43:37.200 --> 43:44.560]  the term Honolulu advertiser Japanese to strike Pearl Harbor and you'll see a scan of the
[43:44.560 --> 43:48.400]  full Honolulu advertiser. Let's just show them right now. Let's just show them right
[43:48.400 --> 43:53.960]  now how they can discover all of this for themselves and stop being so ignorant. We
[43:53.960 --> 43:58.720]  can pull up the San Diego newspaper about the Gulf of Tonkinby in stage 1964 when the
[43:58.720 --> 44:02.400]  sailors got back and some of the officers said it was staged. Of course now it's declassified.
[44:02.400 --> 44:07.520]  I mean, what's it going to take, ladies and gentlemen, for you to realize the truth about
[44:07.520 --> 44:11.640]  all of this, that four midget submarines attacked Pearl Harbor that morning and the ships were
[44:11.640 --> 44:19.120]  still ordered to stand down. That's been declassified. To be technical, two attacked the harbor, two
[44:19.120 --> 44:23.360]  attacked other areas. Well, one attacked another and another got beached and that was several
[44:23.360 --> 44:30.440]  hours before. But you can pull that up. That's actually CNN headline. US attacked Japan at
[44:30.440 --> 44:35.560]  Pearl Harbor first. That's actually in my film Masters of Terror. But I digress. I'm
[44:35.560 --> 44:39.320]  sorry. I've got all these stacks of news I promised to get to first before I go to your
[44:39.320 --> 44:47.120]  calls and we got into stack number three. There it is. There is the Honolulu advertiser
[44:47.120 --> 44:52.360]  and he says Japanese may strike over weekend and then you read it and they give the exact
[44:52.360 --> 44:56.320]  morning and date and everything because good people inside the cub breaking and Washington
[44:56.320 --> 45:01.120]  refused to go along with Roosevelt and Churchill and actually warned intelligence officers
[45:01.120 --> 45:05.400]  there at the base and their radar picked it up. They were ordered to stand down as well.
[45:05.400 --> 45:13.400]  They were told it was a group of bombers coming in, US bombers. Okay. Continuing, crisis
[45:13.400 --> 45:22.000]  awaits world banks as trillions come due and they admit that's about to kick off something
[45:22.000 --> 45:29.080]  bigger than October 2008 crash. Here's a secret gold swap has spooked the market. It takes
[45:29.080 --> 45:36.280]  a lot to spook the solid old gold market. But when it emerged last week that one of more
[45:36.280 --> 45:40.360]  banks had lent 380 tons of gold, the Bank of International Settlements and returned
[45:40.360 --> 45:45.480]  for foreign currencies, there was widespread surprise and confusion. And again, the banks
[45:45.480 --> 45:49.400]  do this. They manipulate and sell gold back and forth at lower prices and that's come
[45:49.400 --> 45:53.920]  out congressional hearings to artificially drive it down. This is how we've known for
[45:53.920 --> 45:58.080]  15 years, at least I've known for 15 years and GATA is known for close to a decade since
[45:58.080 --> 46:04.360]  they're founding how all this is done, the gold antitrust action committee. And so here
[46:04.360 --> 46:08.160]  it is in the news, how they manipulate it. But the media spins this the other way like,
[46:08.160 --> 46:13.080]  oh, gold should then go down. Well, gold's actually up 16 bucks today. The news that
[46:13.080 --> 46:18.400]  the mystery bank has just pawned, the family jewels gave traders a jolt, nervous about
[46:18.400 --> 46:22.560]  the sudden transfer of almost 20% of the world's annual gold production and the possibility
[46:22.560 --> 46:26.840]  of a sell off. So they're trying to put out this rumor that there's about to be a popping
[46:26.840 --> 46:32.520]  of the gold bubble. How can that happen in gold and silver when at inflation numbers
[46:32.520 --> 46:37.440]  for 1980, it should be $2,500 an ounce or more. So they could do this short term, but
[46:37.440 --> 46:43.640]  not long term because they're devaluing currencies worldwide and dollars and yen and yen and
[46:43.640 --> 46:51.280]  euros are being devalued. And so gold is denominated in those currencies. And so it's going to
[46:51.280 --> 46:58.360]  go up. Gold's not really going up. The currencies are losing value. So that's how they spin
[46:58.360 --> 47:03.000]  this in a tiny footnote in its annual report, the bank disclosed its unusually large holding
[47:03.000 --> 47:08.320]  of gold compared with nothing the year before. The disclosure was a large factor in the correction
[47:08.320 --> 47:13.280]  of gold price this week. Well, this is the bank hoarding gold and buying it out from
[47:13.280 --> 47:16.680]  another group. So that should actually send gold up. Well, I tell you, they can really
[47:16.680 --> 47:21.520]  make lemons that eliminate, can't they? And the average dumb down person reads that and
[47:21.520 --> 47:22.520]  buys it.
[47:22.520 --> 47:27.840]  Republicans sound warning over expiration of Bush tax cuts with the economy still sputtering
[47:27.840 --> 47:32.720]  Republicans are drawing renewed attention to the looming expiration of Bush era tax
[47:32.720 --> 47:38.320]  cuts and warned that the roadblock will clomber everyone from small business owners to middle
[47:38.320 --> 47:45.960]  class families with the economy still sputtering Republicans are drawing renewed attention to
[47:45.960 --> 47:50.920]  the looming expiration of Bush era tax cuts and warning that the roadblock will clomber
[47:50.920 --> 47:57.040]  everyone from small business owners to middle class families. And the tax is just huge in
[47:57.040 --> 48:02.200]  the trillions and trillions of dollars and is on almost every tax bracket. Obama lied
[48:02.200 --> 48:06.280]  about how it would be implemented. They now admit people making even less than $50,000
[48:06.280 --> 48:11.480]  a year will be hit by the tax. And of course, business owners will have to cut jobs and
[48:11.480 --> 48:19.280]  lay people off because of this. But you have to understand my friends that and I talk about
[48:19.280 --> 48:23.840]  this all the time, but Kennedy in one tax bracket cut it by 35% and another by 40 and
[48:23.840 --> 48:30.160]  another by 50 and some of the lowest brackets he cut it by 50 and tax receipts more than
[48:30.160 --> 48:37.480]  doubled in one year after his 1961 tax cut. I mean, Kennedy was a patriot. He wasn't perfect,
[48:37.480 --> 48:42.280]  but he went and his advisors and pointed out, well, sir, when we cut taxes, the economy
[48:42.280 --> 48:47.760]  surges and he said, well, cut them cut them as much as you can. I mean, especially if
[48:47.760 --> 48:53.040]  the government gets more money, the government doesn't want more tax receipts. They want
[48:53.040 --> 48:57.680]  to bankrupt the economy. They want to drive you out of your cars into buses. They want
[48:57.680 --> 49:01.880]  to bankrupt you off the road. They want to bankrupt you so you can't send your children
[49:01.880 --> 49:06.680]  to private school. They want to bankrupt you and shut down all energy supplies in the
[49:06.680 --> 49:10.440]  United States. This is an act of war, the carbon tax now being implemented, even though
[49:10.440 --> 49:16.760]  they can't the Senate to pass it through the EPA and others. They want you to go bankrupt.
[49:16.760 --> 49:20.800]  California knew in the last two years when they raised all those taxes. California knew
[49:20.800 --> 49:27.120]  full well that when they did that, the economy would go from sputtering to full cardiac arrest,
[49:27.120 --> 49:32.480]  a total stallout, the engine blew. Schwarzenegger's up there stealing and grabbing and insider
[49:32.480 --> 49:38.400]  trading and he worked with the Enron on scamming people. I mean, he is just in there, but when
[49:38.400 --> 49:41.560]  he got in, he was worth something like 800 million and now he's supposedly worth like
[49:41.560 --> 49:47.440]  $2 billion. I mean, he's in there as governor just, just raping everyone, laughing at everyone.
[49:47.440 --> 49:52.360]  There's all these quotes about, he loves to abuse and con people and manipulate them.
[49:52.360 --> 49:57.000]  California's raised all these taxes. Michigan's raising taxes. You've got New York raising
[49:57.000 --> 50:02.120]  taxes. In fact, they passed 80 plus taxes in the last couple of years. I saw that headline
[50:02.120 --> 50:08.300]  in the Wall Street Journal and it was 84, 86 taxes and it's just imploding. The middle
[50:08.300 --> 50:12.480]  class is moving out. The third world populations are moving in. They immediately are given
[50:12.480 --> 50:17.520]  welfare because the system is in an economic takeover. They want it bankrupt. After things
[50:17.520 --> 50:22.320]  are bankrupt, they're going to cut all the services to the poor people. They're going
[50:22.320 --> 50:26.680]  to slash those except for Planned Parenthood and sterilization and things. They're going
[50:26.680 --> 50:30.840]  to slash that after they've got all the third world people here, after they can be then
[50:30.840 --> 50:35.920]  used as a political weapon to say, you want half of what you used to get? Vote to rob
[50:35.920 --> 50:40.280]  that tiny middle class that's left. Then they'll vote to rob them, vote to take their guns
[50:40.280 --> 50:47.600]  and then the globalists will say, now you get even less. It's just so diabolical. I'll
[50:47.600 --> 50:51.880]  get more into the economy later. We're going to come back, take calls for the next 30 minutes
[50:51.880 --> 50:56.720]  or so. Then I'm going to get into a ton of news, but first I want to get into seeing
[50:56.720 --> 51:01.480]  an end saying people being murdered is good. I'm not kidding. You can't make this stuff
[51:01.480 --> 51:04.080]  up. We all know that the Berkey water purification

[54:08.240 --> 54:13.080]  There are two stories up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com both by Kurt Nemo and Paul
[54:13.080 --> 54:17.800]  Watson that are essential. We're asking you to get these and email them out to everyone
[54:17.800 --> 54:24.520]  post them on your Facebook, MySpace, YouTube, you name it. CNN Sanchez, dead Americans good
[54:24.520 --> 54:34.480]  for war against manufactured terror. That's Kurt Nemo's headline. Here is the CNN headline
[54:34.480 --> 54:39.360]  that Watson's got posted. CNN hosts calls deadly terror bombings helpful to new world
[54:39.360 --> 54:44.040]  order agenda. And the reason these articles are so important, we have the top generals
[54:44.040 --> 54:48.800]  in a meeting with Rumsfeld four years ago saying 9-11 sure helped us, sir. We sure need
[54:48.800 --> 54:53.840]  another one. And they come one millimeter from saying they staged the attacks in these incredible
[54:53.840 --> 54:57.360]  recordings that got released by four year. And then of course we have all these other
[54:57.360 --> 55:05.120]  headlines from a newspaper saying 9-11 helped America. We need another 9-11. Remember those
[55:05.120 --> 55:13.360]  incredible headlines and different editorialists had to apologize and retract. Will this host
[55:13.360 --> 55:19.400]  talking about the Aganda attacks that killed more than 70 people in four separate bombings.
[55:19.400 --> 55:25.040]  Will he apologize? He was talking to a CIA officer and he said, well, you got to admit
[55:25.040 --> 55:29.280]  you know, this helps show how evil the Muslims are. And you know, my issue is there are some
[55:29.280 --> 55:32.920]  Muslim terror attacks. There are some Muslim terrorists, but most of it is either purely
[55:32.920 --> 55:39.160]  staged or intelligence agencies finance other terror groups to carry out attacks. I mean,
[55:39.160 --> 55:43.960]  Israel admits they founded Hamash. That's herets and Jerusalem post as a counterbalance to
[55:43.960 --> 55:48.520]  the PLO. Remember, we told you two years ago, the Mumbai attacks were a government op run
[55:48.520 --> 55:52.720]  by the CIA. And because the head of Indian intelligence said that, then they assassinated
[55:52.720 --> 55:57.640]  him. And then it turned out that a quote U.S. government agent with the CIA commanded
[55:57.640 --> 56:01.840]  the attacks. That was the Chicago Tribune. That just came out what two months ago. I
[56:01.840 --> 56:07.400]  mean, these articles detail this whole history. And I have to tell you, this is very suspicious.
[56:07.400 --> 56:12.320]  What happened in Uganda and they're trying to move Afrikan in there and have the U.S.
[56:12.320 --> 56:18.080]  military occupy it. They have South com, North com, sent com. Now they want Afrikan, Afrikor.
[56:18.080 --> 56:21.980]  Let's go ahead and go to this incredible clip where he first pulls on your heartstrings
[56:21.980 --> 56:27.840]  talking about an aid worker who was killed. And then he segues into, well, this is a good
[56:27.840 --> 56:39.000]  thing talking to the CIA officer. This is outrageous.
[56:39.000 --> 56:43.120]  I want to tell you a story now. Welcome back. I'm Rick Sanchez. This is Rick's list. This
[56:43.120 --> 56:49.280]  is a story about a guy named Nate Hen. This is important. Stay with me here. By all accounts,
[56:49.280 --> 56:54.880]  American Nate Hen was a hell of a guy. This is a selfless individual who devoted his young
[56:54.880 --> 57:03.280]  life to helping others. Today, he's dead. Nate Hen is dead. Killed by murderous terrorists
[57:03.280 --> 57:08.920]  in the faraway land of Uganda, where Hen was working with children. Thousands of people
[57:08.920 --> 57:13.440]  had gathered in Uganda's capital to watch the final game of the World Cup. They're watching
[57:13.440 --> 57:18.920]  a soccer game. The game was in its 19th minute when the bombs began to explode. One at a
[57:18.920 --> 57:25.280]  restaurant, then two at a rugby field where they were watching on an outdoor stream. Our
[57:25.280 --> 57:33.920]  latest tally of the number who died, 74. 74 innocent people are dead. Joining me now is
[57:33.920 --> 57:38.640]  Gary Bernstein. He's a former CIA officer. But you know what's interesting about this?
[57:38.640 --> 57:47.480]  In a strange way, the event is helpful to the cause of those of us who know how sadistic
[57:47.480 --> 57:54.240]  these fundamental radical Islamic terrorists are. And if it helps get the message out there
[57:54.240 --> 58:02.720]  that these are not the good guys, then so be it. Then so be it. Now, this is a big, big
[58:02.720 --> 58:07.800]  issue and you can go read all these other reporters and analysts and Pentagon people
[58:07.800 --> 58:12.360]  saying, oh, we sure need another 9-11 to teach the lazy, bad American people that we need
[58:12.360 --> 58:17.480]  to attack Iran, that we need to go into other countries. And then, of course, it came out
[58:17.480 --> 58:21.640]  not just in Mumbai, that it was a government operation run by the West. But remember, it
[58:21.640 --> 58:26.280]  came out in mainstream news that the Bali operation was an inside job. I mean, they
[58:26.280 --> 58:31.440]  do this over and over again. This is just a fact. This is just a fact. It's like the
[58:31.440 --> 58:37.160]  U.S.'s liberty was staged to be blamed on Egypt. Even a BBC documentary found that.
[58:37.160 --> 58:43.680]  It was called Operation Cyanide. We'll be right back.

[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:29.280]  Well, if you just joined us, CNN host calls the deadly terror bombings helpful in the
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:35.280]  New World Order agenda. That's prisonplanet.com. We'll play that again later in the hour. CNN
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:40.280]  Sanchez, the dead Americans good for war against manufactured terror, that it's helpful and
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:46.320]  that so be it if it helps understand how evil the Muslims are. Key article, I'll be detailing
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:51.040]  more coming up. Also, I want to get into FDA panel to review safety of diabetes drug,
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:57.480]  Vandia. Another big European report that aspertames causing miscarriages and low birth weights
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:03.120]  and a bunch of other genetic engineering poisoning eugenics news, that is all coming up. But
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:10.200]  I want to go to your phone calls as well here today. After I take their calls here in the
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:14.760]  next 20 minutes, I'm also going to get into suffer these criminals in Oakland. Don't call
[01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:19.240]  the cops. Dozens of layoffs effective at midnight, barring last minute deal. The police are
[01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:22.240]  saying they're not going to respond to petty crime. That's actually been going on for a
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:28.760]  long time. Now it's just official. And I wanted to dovetail that with Cleveland, Ohio's suburb.
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:32.880]  And it talks about counties there saying buy guns. We can't protect you. At least they're
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:38.160]  being honest. So that's coming up as well. Also the latest on the oil spill. But right
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:45.600]  now, let's go to James in Ohio, listening on 900 AM W C E R. Good to have you on the
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:57.240]  air with us, James. Go ahead, James. James, are you there? Okay, we'll put them on hold
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:02.080]  and go back to them in a moment. Let's go ahead and talk to Mark in Texas. Mark, you're
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:07.720]  on the air. Welcome. Hey, well, thank you, Alex. I was looking
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:12.360]  at some of your some of the good things you've done here. And I know you had read Beckman
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:18.560]  on your program before. And I had several things today. And at first, I wanted to challenge
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:26.560]  you, Alex, to get him back on there again, if possible. And in his in Beckman's born
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:33.840]  again, Republic Book pages 133 to 136. Is he talking about a will and testament left
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:41.640]  to us here in 2010 by the signers of the Constitution? I remember one of the signers
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:49.240]  was asked, What is this? It's a public matter. Maybe you can keep it. Yeah, yeah, it said
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:55.180]  and he replied. It will look Yeah, in context here exactly. It will be good only when we
[01:02:55.180 --> 01:03:00.840]  the people will be as serious about it as those who have signed it are. Yeah, freedom
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:06.160]  is not a spectator sport. You better be involved 110% or you're going to be enslaved. Mark,
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:12.960]  I appreciate your call. Nathan in Florida, you're on the air. Hello. Yes, sir. Well,
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:20.360]  good to talk to you, sir. I'm assuming you've read David Rockefeller's book memoirs. Yes,
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:24.760]  where he says I am guilty of wanting to set up a world government to abridge US sovereignty.
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:30.320]  He says that's what I'm accused of and I say guilty is charged. Absolutely. Since he
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:35.840]  has written this book and I mean it's in his own words and everything. I'm wondering what
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:43.560]  can we do to possibly arrest him and try him for high treason? Well, you've got to educate
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:48.180]  the public that what high treason is Obama blocking Arizona and saying I want the crime
[01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:53.040]  to continue to hold people hostage to pass global amnesty for the North American Union.
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:56.680]  That's an act of treason and you've got to educate people about what treason is. I mean,
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:59.560]  the average person doesn't know that there's literally thousands of books, thousands of
[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:03.520]  white papers written by every prominent globalist about how they're poisoning our water and
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:08.720]  our food and setting up world government and Kim trailing the skies and it's all admitted.
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:13.200]  I mean, I have thousands, no exaggeration, thousands of documents admitting their Kim
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:18.680]  trailing, poisoning the food, GMO-ing. I mean, I am wallowing in evidence and I'm just here
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:22.400]  trying to present it to people and saying, hey, instead of knowing all about LeBron James
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:27.800]  who has the chosen one tattooed on his back and likens himself to King James of the King
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:34.560]  James version, he's some type of God or demigod. How about we become informed about how there's
[01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:41.040]  total tyranny unfolding? Well, I'm no lawyer, so I'm just wondering is there any way to
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:46.480]  get the cops involved and actually arrest this guy and start a trial? Well, that's something
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:51.000]  grand juries could do. I mean, you've got somebody who's in control of much of the government
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:55.160]  who engineered the banking collapse saying he wants to destroy America. And so, again,

[01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:16.840]  through their own words and documents. The new world order really is a tool for addressing
[01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:22.160]  a new world of possibilities. It means all the world under their control. The United Nations
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:28.480]  would take over America. The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world. Invisible Empire chronicles
[01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:33.600]  how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:37.840]  world government. I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:42.080]  constitution for the global financial system. Global governance with the establishment of
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:47.120]  the G20. So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else. And I got news

[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:39.360]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are now into the second hour, eight minutes in here. I'm
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:43.200]  going to be breaking down the economy more at the bottom of the hour. I'm also going
[01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:47.120]  to get into Fidel Castro is now saying that he thinks World War III is about to begin.
[01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:52.360]  I'm going to go over some of his quotes there. An Iraq inquiry says the government intentionally
[01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:56.960]  and substantively exaggerated WMD threat. We already know that but it's amazing to see
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:02.840]  the British government admit it. Breaking news due to public outcry, Coast Guard rescinds
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:08.160]  ban on reporters and photographers from oil spill. They threatened two weeks ago to charge
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:12.880]  you with federal felonies if you tried to photograph or videotape anything going on
[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:17.400]  either in the Gulf or on the beach. But that's totally unconstitutional. The tyrants have
[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:23.480]  now at least backed off on the surface. The arrest and intimidation are continuing. So
[01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:28.600]  we'll be discussing some of that coming up. And all over the United States, very ominous
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:38.240]  developments as CNN and others report that the United States has lost its triple A rating
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:43.920]  as a nation. So has Europe to the communist Chinese. People say, well, then who cares?
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:49.760]  Well, they're our biggest creditor. They buy this worthless paper. And now from California
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:57.040]  to Iowa and many other areas, they are reporting that police will not respond to normal crime.
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:03.360]  And so we're going to be going over some of that coming up as well. But right now, we're
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:09.560]  going to go ahead and talk to Nathan in Texas. Nathan, go ahead.
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:15.600]  Hey, Alex. Great to talk to you again. I just wanted to make a suggestion. I've been befriending
[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:20.960]  people all around the globe on Facebook, you know, seeing their posts, you know, posting
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:25.360]  things they comment on mine, I comment on theirs. I think it's a good way to get involved,
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:30.280]  you know, to get everybody kind of to unite. So I think everybody should have 1500 Facebook
[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:34.960]  friends who are info warriors. And also, secondly, I just wanted to ask about this guy, Amiri,
[01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:40.160]  who was supposedly a he was a missing Iranian nuclear scientist. Just your comments on that.
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:44.280]  Well, they just said there's been a new development 30 seconds before I walked in. I saw a Reuters
[01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:50.480]  article that Phil tried to tell me about. And so I don't have the latest on that, but
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:54.840]  we will cover that for you coming up as soon as I'm able to research it. What's your take,
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:55.840]  Nathan?
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:59.960]  Oh, I just think as far as that goes, I mean, I just I didn't know what to think of it. I
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:03.360]  saw that there was a few different videos that had come out saying that he was here
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:08.200]  studying. He was here and he said he'd been kidnapped by the CIA and tortured and stuff.
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:13.240]  And now he's at the embassy in Washington is trying to get back to Iran. I'm just wondering
[01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:17.720]  if, you know, maybe that's some kind of propaganda they're trying to spend to make it look like
[01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:22.720]  Iran has nuclear scientists over here, something the possibility of a, you know, staged Iranian
[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:27.680]  attack, you know, to line up with all of what's going on with, you know, a state, you know,
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:28.680]  getting ready for war.
[01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:34.440]  Well, they did that in 2002 and 2003. They would claim that Iraqi defectors had told
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:38.040]  them one thing and then later the defectors came out and said that they hadn't said that.
[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:43.480]  And strangely enough in Jordan and Iraq, they would then be hunted down and killed mysteriously
[01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:58.080]  by Al Qaeda. Why would Al Qaeda or Al CIA to try to kill someone that is basically critical
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:03.680]  of the lies that took us to war? I appreciate your call and I do have that article. Let
[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:10.680]  me read part of it here on air and then give you my take on it.
[01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:17.720]  Here is the headline out of Reuters. Iran scientist turns up at Washington mission, a missing
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:26.040]  Iranian nuclear scientist dramatically turned up in an Iranian interest section of Pakistan's
[01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:32.480]  embassy in Washington and was quoted as saying he was kidnapped by the U.S. agents in a disgraceful
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:37.760]  act, but a U.S. official who declined to be named said that the scientists who vanished
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:42.720]  during a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia more than a year ago have been visiting the United States
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:48.880]  and decided to return to Iran of his own free will. Tehran is reportedly accused, the CIA
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:54.680]  of abducting him who worked for Iran's atomic energy organization, but ABC News has reported
[01:12:54.680 --> 01:13:01.640]  he defected and was helping the agency. Washington denied he was spirited away for nuclear secrets.
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:06.360]  My kidnapping was this grateful act for America. I was under enormous psychological pressure
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:11.800]  and supervision of armed guards in the past 14 months. A Mary who is in his 30s was quoted
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:16.520]  as saying in a phone interview with Iran State TV. Iran is locked in a dispute with the United
[01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:20.520]  States and its allies over Tehran's nuclear development program that the West says is
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:26.440]  designed to produce nuclear weapons and which Iran officially says aims to generate power.
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:31.520]  And there's another development hot off the presses. Iranian scientists came freely to
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:38.200]  U.S. officials now say, so was he really kidnapped or is he trying to cover up his
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:44.080]  defection back to Iran? Who knows, my friends. But your point about how they're trying to
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:50.880]  hype up war with Iran is well taken. Here is Press TV, which is an English speaking version
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:56.320]  of Iranian state television. It's basically like Al Jazeera is to Saudi Arabia. MP says
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:14:02.560]  sanctions a declaration of war on Iran. By the way, Ron Paul agrees. I mean, if somebody
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:07.600]  came and blocked goods and services coming into the U.S. with warships and was grabbing
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:11.680]  U.S. bank accounts worldwide, that'd be an act of war. A senior Iranian lawmaker says
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:16.320]  the new round of anti-Iran U.N. Security Council sanctions is an open declaration of war against
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:20.880]  Iran by the six major powers. Speaking to the farce news agency on Sunday, member of
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:27.280]  Iran's Parliament's Foreign Policy and National Security Commission, Mohammed Karim Rod, said
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:32.640]  the administration of the U.S. president never truly after a nuclear fuel exchange with Iran.
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:37.200]  Yeah, they offered to give all their nuclear fuel to the U.N. to be enriched in Brazil
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:42.080]  or in Turkey or in France, so they'd 100 percent know it couldn't be used for weapons. And they
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:48.000]  said, no, five years ago, before they put Ahmadinejad in, they were very soft, the opposite
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:51.680]  of hard line, and were letting inspectors in everywhere. And then the U.N. said you can't
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:56.880]  even have peaceful reactors. Now they're trying to put sanctions on to block fuel being imported,
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:15:01.520]  because Iran has a lot of oil, but they, refineries are very expensive and very complex.
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:05.520]  They can only refine about half the fuel they need, so they want reactors for power.
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:13.040]  And they're growing population. President Obama did not expect Iran to accept the exchange.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:18.480]  It's 3.5 percent enriched uranium with 20 percent enriched bashed outside of Iranian soil, he went
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:22.640]  on to say. But see, that's too complex for the average person to actually research and figure
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:29.040]  out. They're too busy knowing all of the trivia about Lindsey Lohan or Michael Jordan or any of
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:35.920]  these people. They're just too busy. They know all about Paris Hilton and her sex tape, but they
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:40.640]  know nothing about what's happened in Iran's history with the United States. And continuing,
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:47.200]  Iran backed group I'd attack on U.S. bases in Iraq, general says. So now we see our general saying that
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:52.880]  Iran, it wants to back attacks on U.S. troops in Iraq. Meanwhile, for five years, the White
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:16:01.200]  House admits under Bush and now Obama, consecutively, it's congruent that they have four different
[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:06.240]  terror groups, three of them al-Qaeda backed attacking Iranian bases and military and police
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:13.200]  in Iran. Iran has sued the U.S. at the UN over this and lays there and takes it. So our government
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:17.360]  launches terror attacks against them on a weekly basis. U.S. special forces have been there for
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:24.320]  at least eight years. Arabic U.S. citizens who are special forces doing this and it's all admitted.
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:28.640]  It's an act of war, but Iran puts up with it. The average good old boy doesn't know that. They think,
[01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:34.960]  them Iranian A-rabbers want to kill us. They're not Arabs, by the way, but here's another one.
[01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:40.240]  Iran's strike rumors are spinning out of control. A good boil down article here where it links to
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:46.240]  all these mainstream news reports where Israel, the U.S., the UN, NATO are all talking about
[01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:54.480]  striking Iran and calling for strikes on Iran. So there, I've gone over basically the latest
[01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:59.840]  Middle East, Central Asia news for you. I meant to get to that later, but since you brought it
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:05.520]  up, I've gotten to it now. Let's continue with your phone calls. Let us now speak with
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:13.040]  Lisa in New York. Lisa, you're on the air. Hi, Alex. I was wondering about what you were
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:20.720]  mentioning yesterday that the government is planning on confiscating or somehow whoever
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:27.600]  has a retirement plan isn't really going to get a hold of it. Can you explain to me about that?
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:30.880]  Yes, ma'am. I'm going to let you go because your phone's so bad, but it's an important question.
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:36.720]  Thanks for calling. This is a multifaceted cocktail. There's so many ways that they steal
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:42.400]  part of or all of pensions that it would make your head spin. But let me just cover one way,
[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:47.280]  and this is at record levels worldwide, not just in the U.S. You can search the term
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:55.040]  retirees losing pensions at record rates, and it'll hundreds of articles will come up,
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:18:01.040]  literally hundreds. One trick that General Electric or Kodak or General Motors or any
[01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:06.640]  of these companies will do. They've all done it. Defense contractors are doing this at record
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:10.480]  levels as they move to China. Oh, yeah, they're moving to China. Over 90 percent of our drugs
[01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:14.320]  are now made in China, including vaccines, side issue, not a national security issue to the
[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:19.040]  government, though. They love it. The Chinese are part of eugenicists. They have a one-child
[01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:22.880]  policy. They're helping spike the vaccines. Of course, it's being made there, but I digress.
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:30.640]  One way that they do it is they will create a subsidiary, take a famous computer microchip
[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:40.240]  maker here in Austin. What, six years ago, they created a spin-off and basically got rid of
[01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:48.240]  everybody's pensions and shut down the old company and then hired Indian replacements and
[01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:54.640]  young people that had graduated here in the U.S., I guess to speak English, a small minority of them,
[01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:59.680]  to manage that. And that's just one example. So what they do is they create subsidiaries
[01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:04.880]  to take your pensions. Bush, seven years ago, spearheaded a change in the law
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:13.040]  that allowed corporations to take your pensions, all are part of them. And then now you hear the
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:19.040]  term austerity in England, in the U.S. and Canada, in Greece, in Spain, in Portugal, in Germany,
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:24.800]  that they've got to raise your taxes, cut welfare, but also cut your retirement.
[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:30.000]  And the companies need to do that. And then, of course, Bloomberg has reported
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:36.400]  that they are, the federal regulators are now, quote, ordering. They don't have that power,
[01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:40.960]  but people follow the orders of these thugs for private pension funds to be invested,
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:46.400]  quote, in failed banks. That's a Bloomberg headline. And so basically what they do is
[01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:51.920]  companies create subsidiaries. Then they bankrupt the old company, kind of like Enron did,
[01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:58.000]  and then that's how they don't pay you your pension or they reduce your pension. And yes,
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:04.480]  that's happening everywhere. We'll be right back. What started as an idea to provide power for a

[01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:30.640]  I'm Rick Sanchez, this is Rick's List, this is a story about a guy named Nate Hen. This is important,
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:37.440]  stay with me here. By all accounts, American Nate Hen was a hell of a guy. This is a selfless
[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:44.320]  individual who devoted his young life to helping others. Today, he's dead. Nate Hen is dead,
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:52.000]  killed by murderous terrorists in the faraway land of Uganda, where Hen was working with children.
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:56.880]  Thousands of people had gathered in Uganda's capital to watch the final game of the World Cup.
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:25:02.480]  They're watching a soccer game. The game was in its 19th minute when the bombs began to explode.
[01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:08.320]  One at a restaurant, then two at a rugby field where they were watching on an outdoor screen.
[01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:17.920]  Our latest tally of the number who died, 74. 74 innocent people are dead. Joining me now is
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:23.440]  Gary Bernstein. He's a former CIA officer. But you know what's interesting about this? In a strange
[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:33.680]  way, the event is helpful to the cause of those of us who know how sadistic these fundamental
[01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:39.120]  radical Islamic terrorists are. And if it helps get the message out there that these are not the
[01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:48.800]  good guys, then so be it. All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:05.600]  Let's continue here with your phone calls coming up in the next segment. But first,
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:14.160]  I wanted to go back into this CNN host calls deadly terror bombings helpful to new world order agenda.
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:22.400]  CNN host Rick Sanchez let slip a telling admission in response to the deadly bombings in Uganda
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:26.800]  during his show yesterday. The fact that such attacks are quote helpful for the military
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:32.400]  industrial complex agenda to take over and occupy third world countries after AFRICOM,
[01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:38.400]  the United States African Command speaking with former CIA agent Sanchez stated you know what's
[01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:45.040]  interesting about this. It's strange way the event is helpful to the cause of those of us
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:51.520]  who know how sadistic these fundamental radical Islamic terrorists are. And if it helps get the
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:57.680]  message out that there are these and you know good guys, then so be it. Let me read that again.
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:03.600]  Islamic terrorist and that if it helps get the message out that there are these guys and that
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:08.000]  these guys are not the good guys, then so be it. And of course, we just played the clip again. You
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:14.000]  can watch that clip up on info wars.com and prisonpunna.com. What an incredible admission
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:21.680]  by this guy. Who's up next here, John? All right, Norman in Ohio, you're on the air. Welcome.
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:24.960]  Hi, Alex. How are you? I'm okay, sir. Go ahead.
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:31.120]  Well, you were talking about eugenics earlier. I'd like to equate circumcision with eugenics
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:38.720]  in America, this institution that started in 1955. It takes away the most erogenous zones of the male
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:43.920]  penis results in a smaller head, which are connected to the brain. The nerves are connected
[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:50.800]  to your brain. So it results in a smaller head side less developed head and mental physical prowess.
[01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:58.240]  Force can restoration is possible. I would recommend your listeners that are circumcised
[01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:03.520]  to Google force can restoration. I read an article last night saying Bill Clinton in the CDC
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:08.640]  want circumcision to be mandatory worldwide in order to fight fight AIDS.
[01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:14.240]  I mean, that's incredible. That's true because it is people's choice whether they get circumcised
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:20.240]  or not. And most Americans are not getting circumcised now. And, you know, there's arguments for
[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:26.800]  and against. But let's go ahead and search that term. Bill Clinton calls for mandatory circumcision.
[01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:32.000]  Wow. If that's the case, that is outrageous. I can tell you it's Why Night News, the title
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:39.280]  of the article is Clinton colon circumcision dash the answer to AIDS. It's from whyknightnews.com.
[01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:46.880]  They use this false evidence that came out of Africa saying that circumcision cuts AIDS transmission
[01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:52.560]  by 40 percent. Well, we know AIDS is declassified to be a Navy bio weapon developed in the 70s
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:58.080]  as an autoimmune cancer virus. And we know what it does. And I've had top scientists on about that.
[01:28:58.080 --> 01:29:04.640]  So and to claim that you could get AIDS through your skin, HIV is a very weak virus.
[01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:10.480]  And that it would have anything to do with it is just asinine. The answer is abstinence.
[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:14.320]  But they've done studies, even the BBC has admitted it were people who haven't had their hymen
[01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:20.320]  broken. Women who have not been lost their virginity are getting HIV over there. And the only thing
[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:24.640]  that the BBC admitted a few years ago, it could be was quote, the vaccines. But they said, oh,
[01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:33.040]  the UN must not be using a new needle each time. They must be sharing needles in the vaccination.
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:36.880]  Yeah, there it is. Incredible. Uningardian circumcision. Maybe the answer to AIDS says
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:41.520]  Clinton. All right. Thank you, sir. Glad you called Dave, Matt, Jim, Kevin, many others are
[01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:56.800]  called straight ahead. Stay with us. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and
[01:29:56.800 --> 01:30:05.920]  the GCN radio network. The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the
[01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:12.240]  sand? What have we got? A republic or a monarchy? A republic is based on a constitution which
[01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:17.200]  protects minority rights, not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's
[01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:21.280]  for dinner. So they think they own our land. They think they're on our water, children,
[01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:27.840]  our education, our money. We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate. Somebody's going
[01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:34.560]  to ask you what you did during the patriot uprising. We have the facts. We have the constitution. We
[01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:39.040]  have the Bill of Rights. We have common law. Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm
[01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:43.760]  so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic. Terranny is upon us,
[01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:48.480]  but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising. A new tool in the
[01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:57.840]  Info War. Don't Tread on Me. Order it at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139
[01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:03.360]  and support independent, patriotic liberty films. This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you
[01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:08.400]  should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily
[01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:13.360]  double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much
[01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:18.640]  power your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity
[01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:23.600]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country,
[01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:29.120]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:33.920]  the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year,
[01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:38.560]  thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power
[01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:42.960]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the
[01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:47.440]  solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get

[01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:25.440]  Okay, I'm going to continue with Dave, Matt, Jim, Kevin, Justin, and many others.
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:33.920]  I would like to hear listeners take on CNN host Rick Sanchez saying that the terror attacks in
[01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:39.120]  Uganda that killed over 70 people are, quote, helpful, and that if it helps the agenda of the
[01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:43.600]  New World Order to launch all these wars, that so be it. And then we have a whole article with
[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:47.840]  all these other globalists. In fact, later if I have time the next hour I want to read this whole
[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:53.520]  story quoting in other mainstream articles about how great 9-11 was and how we eat another one.
[01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:57.360]  Now if you read Operation Northwoods where the U.S. government says they want to bomb DC,
[01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:01.680]  bomb Miami, shoot people, and blame it on foreign countries for World War III,
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:07.040]  you'll understand the mindset of this. False flag is taught to U.S. Army captains and above
[01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:12.080]  who were in special ops. That was declassified or leaked by WikiLeaks two years ago. The Pentagon
[01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:17.200]  admitted it was real but said we want to arrest whoever put this out. This was a manual being
[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:24.480]  used up until 2004 that we know of how to stage false flag terror attacks. So the army is taught
[01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:28.720]  out of stage terror, okay? And they're all taught this so they just go public with it.
[01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:32.320]  Hey, this is great. This people got killed. We can launch new wars. You know,
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:36.320]  top Pentagon brass sitting around with Rumsfeld. We have the audio of that linked on here going,
[01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:41.120]  sir, 9-11 sure helped us. It would sure be good if we had another one. Rumsfelds, I know, but it's
[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:46.160]  hard. It's, you know, and they're like, yes, sir, we know. You can tell they're talking about 9-11
[01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:51.040]  truth and they're all, we'll take care of it, sir. We'll, I mean, that made news what four years ago.
[01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:57.360]  So we will actually, that was only two and a half years ago. Boy time flies.
[01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:02.880]  So that is some of what is coming up and I'd like to hear callers comment on that. I think this is
[01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:09.520]  a pretty big deal. But continuing with the economic news, I want to recap this now.
[01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:16.800]  Central banks start to abandon the US dollar. What an amazing statement from CNN. There's
[01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:21.280]  mounting evidence. The central banks have little faith in the green back these days. Can we blame
[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:26.800]  them? And what are the central banks, the private holding consortiums of the top global banks worldwide,
[01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:31.600]  less than 10, six that dominate the US. They're all interconnected. They're globalist. They're
[01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:36.160]  against sovereignty. They want to take all of our sovereignty and all of our liberties and freedoms
[01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:42.800]  and transfer the laws to the international level so they can eradicate freedom. So they're singing in
[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:49.840]  fortune magazines also running with the same headline. Central banks start to abandon the US
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:54.240]  dollar and they go on to talk about how great the central bankers are and how they want to save us
[01:35:54.240 --> 01:35:58.640]  and how much we should love them. And when these are the culprits, but people are so ignorant about
[01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:02.480]  finance and government, they don't even know the Federal Reserve's private, though that's starting
[01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:09.680]  to change. Chinese Rating Agency strips Western nations of AAA status. China's leading credit
[01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:16.080]  rating agency has stripped America, Britain, Germany and France of their AAA ratings, accusing
[01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:23.440]  Anglo-Saxon competitors of ideological bias in favor of the West. China is in a lip lock with
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:29.440]  the globalist. Mao Zedong was put in by the CIA. Again, that's declassified. They own most of our
[01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:34.400]  debt, but now they're going to bash the US. We'll lose our credit rating, so we'll pay even bigger
[01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:39.600]  interest rates to private banks for the right to have a US dollar. So this is all part of moving
[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:44.000]  away from the dollar and onto this global currency controlled by the Communist Chinese,
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:48.080]  who they'll then use as an industrial powerhouse to muscle every other country
[01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:52.320]  in a total deindustrialization, which then bankrupts the nations, which is a form of
[01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:58.080]  financial military warfare. And then they come in with the police state behind that to physically
[01:36:58.080 --> 01:37:04.080]  dominate the populations. And joining us with 30-plus years researching the gold and silver
[01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:07.840]  market is Ted Anderson. Ted, I wanted to bring this next article up to you, and that's what we've
[01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:13.520]  got you on today, plus golds up by over $16. Secret gold swap has spooked the market,
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:20.000]  and gold's actually up from this, but they spun this yesterday as if it would drive down gold
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:25.280]  saying that because central banks are secretly selling masses of gold to each other,
[01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:29.040]  but again, it's a swap. They sell it for a lower price to drive down the price,
[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:34.400]  but the banks are all owned by the same people, so it's not really a sale. That's what Gata found,
[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:40.480]  and it says it takes a lot to spook the gold market. But when it emerged last week that one more bank
[01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:44.720]  had lent 380 tons of gold to the Bank of International Settlements and returned for foreign
[01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:52.160]  currencies, that was widespread surprise and confusion. Yeah, no, I read the same article,
[01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:56.640]  Alex. I mean, we got 380 tons of gold going to the International Bank of Settlements,
[01:37:56.640 --> 01:38:01.680]  so these guys can get more fiat currency. This is just private bankers getting the gold
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:05.840]  for fiat currency for themselves. This is the elites, as we've seen the Saudi Arabians, the
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:11.360]  Chinese, the Japanese, the Indians, the Europeans, the US all moving into gold, and they take this
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:17.360]  and spin it as if it's bad news for gold. Yeah, you're right about that, and it did. It did spook
[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:23.360]  the marketplace enough, I guess, to drop it down to that $1,190 level, but then we've seen it come
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:27.360]  right back up again. Alex, those numbers that you're talking about are significant. It's almost
[01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:32.960]  the entire production for a year of gold being sold all at once in the marketplace,
[01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:38.800]  and no wonder why there's a negative effect on the price of gold. But like you say,
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:43.680]  the insiders knew what was going on. They're buying it, and it didn't last very long. I mean,
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:48.880]  what, two, three days, and now we have gold over $1,200 an ounce again. Let's be clear,
[01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:53.920]  this is a one year mining supply. This is about, it's a little bit under from what I've seen,
[01:38:53.920 --> 01:39:00.400]  right under what is produced every year, and this is kind of a three, four day,
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:05.360]  many accelerated because we're in the high tech society version of what happened in 33,
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:09.440]  and my grandmother remembers this. In fact, I've got to go out and interview World War II vets
[01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:12.480]  and people that are above 80 who do remember this before they all die,
[01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:17.760]  but this is on record from the 1933 War Powers Act and the reorganization of the U.S.,
[01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:21.440]  the takeover of the states via the state police. But for those that don't know,
[01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:28.160]  they declared this emergency act when Roosevelt came in and he ordered all gold
[01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:33.040]  turned into the government, all investment gold, and for one year they depressed the price of
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:38.320]  gold by about 50%. Then one year later, they more than doubled the price up, and it turned out
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:44.800]  there had been secret transfers to Europe of most of our gold supply, and then they went ahead
[01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:50.160]  and more than doubled the price to make a record profit for themselves. So this is a many, well
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:55.760]  not even a many, this is a fast forward replay of that. Well, I mean, Alex said what happened in 1933
[01:39:55.760 --> 01:40:02.400]  was a confiscation of the wealth of the people, and it was put in the hands of the elite. I mean,
[01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:09.040]  even when you read the executive order of 1933 issued by Franklin D. Roosevelt, he doesn't say
[01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:13.600]  that you have to turn this gold into the U.S. government. You have to turn the gold into a
[01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:19.680]  Federal Reserve Bank branch or agency, and what they did is they paid people $26 an ounce for
[01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:26.640]  that gold. One year later, they raised the price to $36 an ounce. The previous to this, the deal
[01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:33.280]  was, us as United States citizens, if we deposited a piece of gold at the bank, the bank would give
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:39.680]  us a certificate of deposit. It was called a $20 bill, and that $20 bill set a gold certificate
[01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:45.760]  of means, meaning that we have gold on deposit. If we go back to get our gold back, you know,
[01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:50.320]  that would, because of fraction reserve banking, you know, everybody was standing in line trying
[01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:53.440]  to get their money out of the bank. But I mean, Chad, this is key. I want to illustrate this,
[01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:59.040]  because then over the next few years, it didn't just go up by the massive amount you talked about,
[01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:06.240]  it went up even more. And that's why today, almost all the gold that you buy at good prices,
[01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:10.960]  to be able to sell to the American people, you're buying from Europe. When everybody else has run
[01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:15.200]  out of gold sources, you've been in this business so long, you've got sources, and it's almost all
[01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:21.440]  European, even a lot of the U.S. gold, the old Eagles, and other things that you buy is coming
[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:27.280]  back in from Europe, because the European bankers set up the Federal Reserve in 1913,
[01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:32.320]  and then a few decades later in 1933, they engineered the Depression and ordered everyone
[01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:38.880]  to turn their gold in for paper, and then they openly shipped it to Europe. That's another example
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:43.680]  of how they've bamboozled us over and over again. I mean, this was the biggest bank robbery in
[01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:49.040]  history, and now they've done the same thing with basically a one-year supply of gold for the entire
[01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:55.600]  world in a four-day period. This is incredible. Yeah, it is. It's just ridiculous when you
[01:41:55.600 --> 01:42:00.160]  think about it that way, and I just wish the people of the United States of America would wake up and
[01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:05.280]  see what really happened to them. I mean, the people in 1933, they didn't know what they were
[01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:13.600]  doing economically. I mean, they're all farmers and labor, and they were hoodwinked. No question
[01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:19.040]  about it, Alex. That money was stolen from them, and like you said, it went to Europe, because we're
[01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:25.680]  importing $20 liberties and $20 St. God and pieces and $10 liberties from Europe for years.
[01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:31.120]  I mean, it all had to do with the Marshall Plan, and like you said, secret transfers that happened
[01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:36.160]  even before that. There is no reason why Europe should have had our gold, but yet it happened,
[01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:41.280]  and it isn't like it went to the European governments. It went to their central banks,
[01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:46.240]  and you're always talking about elite and all these games that they play. I mean,
[01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:51.520]  people could just wake up and see that the elected governments that are out there are not controlling
[01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:56.480]  the world. It's this shadow government behind the elected governments that are doing it,
[01:42:56.480 --> 01:43:02.480]  and that little sell-off that they had here just recently is just an indicator that if you sell the
[01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:08.400]  entire supply of gold that's being produced for a year, they're just short of that, and you can only
[01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:17.200]  drop the price of gold from $1,220 an ounce to $1,192, and then it comes jumping right back
[01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:22.240]  up into $1,200 within a couple of days. There's a lot of demand for gold. There's a lot of people
[01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:26.800]  that aren't buying this crap that they're trying to feed us. Yeah, that's got to panic the globalist
[01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:33.680]  that they dump a year's supply of gold. We're talking just massive, massive, massive tonnage,
[01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:41.360]  380 tons, and I guess every year they produce about 400 tons, so just 20 tons shy of what is
[01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:46.800]  mined every year. The mines can't keep up with what's happening. They dump an entire year's supply
[01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:55.120]  on the market, snatch it up for themselves, and still gold starts exploding back up in price.
[01:43:55.120 --> 01:44:00.320]  But I mean, Ted, if the UN is announcing, if the IMF is announcing, if the World Bank is announcing,
[01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:04.400]  that they're going to have concerted global currency devaluations, and they're saying it's
[01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:11.280]  the end of the dollar in CNN, the New York Times, just everywhere, every day, and saying we deserve
[01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:16.000]  it, and saying the end of America, the beginning of China taking over the planet, of course if
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:21.360]  gold is dominated in global currencies, there's no way to keep gold down. But regardless, this
[01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:27.280]  really illustrates how manipulated and how criminal, I mean, not just the 1933, the Federal Reserve
[01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:31.920]  getting our gold through fraud, of course a lot of people didn't turn it in, a lot of my ancestors,
[01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:35.680]  people still alive didn't, you know, they turn a little in and then keep the rest,
[01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:41.360]  and that really made the bankers mad. But I mean, good for Americans when foreign Federal Reserve
[01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:46.880]  that hijacked our country, you know, 20 years before comes in and steals everybody's gold,
[01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:50.880]  saying, you know, turn it in, be good Americans. Americans aren't going to do that the next time,
[01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:55.840]  these criminal scumbag, this is like made off in Kinley ordering you to turn your gold in
[01:44:55.840 --> 01:45:00.160]  for paper coupons they give you, and then people go and do it. You know, I mean, what have the
[01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:03.520]  government said, give us your children, I guess a lot of people do actually hand them over,
[01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:07.920]  so they can fly them out of the country and be, you know, auctioned off at the orphanages.
[01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:13.760]  But Ted, it's just so massive to know all this was coming from reading globalist documents,
[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:20.000]  and to now be living in a time when record gold sell-offs, and it fails to drive down the price,
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:24.080]  but for three or four days, they're openly announcing the end of the dollar, I mean,
[01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:27.280]  this is insane. They're openly announcing we're going into a depression, Ted.
[01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:32.640]  Well, let's just put it this way, Alex, and I think you already did. You cannot destroy the value
[01:45:32.640 --> 01:45:38.080]  of the dollar without an equal increase in the value of gold. It offsets what another goal has
[01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:44.560]  been valuable for 6,000 years. They didn't find US paper fiat money in the Egyptian tombs when
[01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:48.960]  they opened them up, they found gold. And Ted, let me add this, I mean, what about London Telegraph,
[01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:53.920]  Chinese writing agency strips United States of AAA status? I mean, this is our biggest
[01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:58.720]  creditor. This is the group that buys, you know, we buy cheap toasters that break as soon as you
[01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:02.960]  get them out of the box. They go and buy our currency to control us, and now they're kicking
[01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:07.520]  the United States around, which will actually devalue their biggest investment, but they don't
[01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:12.240]  care. They want to force everybody to move their industry to China, and the CFR is signaling
[01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:17.840]  America's over move to China, more acts of high treason. They need to go arrest those CFR pieces
[01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:22.640]  of crap that have been writing all these policy papers. Yeah, they sure do. Boy, I tell you,
[01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:26.560]  it would be nice to see some of that come along. Unfortunately, they're the ones that have their
[01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:30.800]  hands in the pockets of our lawmakers. And I don't know if we're going to see that. But one thing
[01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:36.400]  you could do for yourself is you can get yourself out of this paper, funny money that they're giving
[01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:42.560]  us and get yourself into something real hard and tangible. I mean, if it's going to be bullets and
[01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:48.560]  guns fine, but you can only have so much of that. You know, I've listened to these people. I've,
[01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:55.360]  I still run into people that have so much money tied up in IRAs in 401k plans in the money in the
[01:46:55.360 --> 01:47:01.040]  bank in the stock market. They want to speculate on that every time it jumps over 10,000. And I
[01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:06.800]  just scratch my head and go, your eyes aren't open to what's happening here. I mean, the United
[01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:13.120]  States dollar is on a, you know, on a runaway track to hell for God's sake. It is. I mean,
[01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:18.240]  the average yuppie is starting to pay a little bit of attention. But when they finally figure out
[01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:22.160]  what's happening, they're going to rush for commodities and the strongest of those being
[01:47:22.160 --> 01:47:28.320]  gold and silver. Here's the business week headline one hour ago. Gold gains most in a month on
[01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:35.840]  increased demand for commodities and gold's up over $16 today. And we're not saying it's a flying
[01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:40.320]  carpet, a golden parachute or silver bullet. We're not saying it's a panacea. We're not saying it's
[01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:46.560]  Valhalla heaven, 40 virgins. What we're saying is it's the best thing out there. Guns, food,
[01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:51.520]  water filters. I mean, you cannot trust in these fiat currencies when they're openly saying they're
[01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:55.200]  going to gut them. Ted, quickly, because I'm going to break and come back with calls and other news,
[01:47:55.200 --> 01:47:59.920]  please tell listeners out there, they can call them by one silver coin, one gold coin,
[01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:03.920]  fifth of an ounce, an ounce, they can buy a thousand ounces. You've got it at the best prices
[01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:09.680]  because you always buy when it's low, sell when it's high at the old low price, give folks the
[01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:14.240]  offer because most gold brokers out there literally are have run out of gold in the last six months,
[01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:19.760]  or they've got giant premiums minus resources folks with the specials we offer. I can certify
[01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:24.960]  these are smoking hot, awesome deals. Ted, give them today's offer. Yeah, sure. The Frank is a
[01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:29.360]  really good offer at 265, considering the fact that you get a four year subscription to the
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:33.840]  international forecaster. And that gives you the information of what's going on in the economy.
[01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:40.560]  The walking Liberty half at 975. I know that internet prices have shot well over $10 for that
[01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:46.960]  coin. We also have the Buffalo coin and it's at the market price. But right now, I think that's
[01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:53.520]  right around that $1300 level. But you know, the market is volatile, it's going up. And Alex,
[01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:58.320]  I need to say people need to get moving. This is we're in July. I know you have to go to break
[01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:03.200]  here real quick. But we're in July, we're looking forward to August, September, October, November.
[01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:07.360]  That's when the gold market gets really hot. And that's when you're going to see market peaks
[01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:12.720]  that you've never seen before. And it only makes sense to take advantage of it when the bankers
[01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:17.600]  are making it cheaper for you. When they're giving you a sale on gold, take advantage of it now,
[01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:23.840]  because now's the time to get in. When everything's going to, you know, to crap here in the fall,
[01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:28.080]  you know, by then it's almost too late to be getting into gold if you want to take advantage
[01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:31.760]  of these lower prices. So I would suggest that you move and you move now.
[01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:39.920]  Well said, Ted. The toll-free number for people who want to call is 800-686-2237.
[01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:49.600]  1-800-686-2237. They can also go to minusresources.com. And you've got some really good specials up
[01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:53.840]  there on the site, but the very best deals are for people that call because they can give you
[01:49:53.840 --> 01:49:59.840]  that daily special, 800-686-2237. And tell them it's the Ted Anderson, Alex Jones special
[01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:03.440]  to take advantage, because it will be a little bit more if you don't tell them it was the special.
[01:50:03.440 --> 01:50:10.640]  And still that's a great deal. But Ted is holding these prices for the next few days, 800-686-2237.
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:17.040]  Ted, any other coins that you've got really good deals on? Well, we've got bags of junk silver,
[01:50:17.040 --> 01:50:22.000]  U.S. Eagles. We have Canadian Maple Leafs. Every now and then we still get Krugerans,
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:29.280]  which are lower in price. I mean, you name it, $10 and $20 Liberties that are so close to melt
[01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:34.160]  that historically they've traded for much higher premiums and they're just right next to the
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:39.280]  melt value of gold. So I would suggest if you're getting into it, if you're looking at gold,
[01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:47.520]  call us now at 800-686-2237, because Alex, I just need to say it. People need to move before
[01:50:47.520 --> 01:50:55.280]  gold's up, not afterwards. 800-686-2237. Ted, great job. God bless you. We'll talk to you again soon.
[01:50:55.280 --> 01:50:59.680]  Thanks, Alex. We'll back with your calls and more news straight ahead. Stay with us.
[01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:06.160]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:10.640]  seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:14.320]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true,
[01:51:14.320 --> 01:51:18.000]  seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that
[01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:22.320]  could even happen again. So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the
[01:51:22.320 --> 01:51:28.640]  perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless
[01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:33.360]  supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds
[01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:38.160]  have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full
[01:51:38.160 --> 01:51:44.880]  acre crisis garden. So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com,
[01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:56.000]  or give them a call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis,
[01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:01.040]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:01.760 --> 01:52:06.960]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind? If it's Berkey water purification
[01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:12.720]  systems, this message is for you. Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride,

[01:52:17.920 --> 01:52:23.120]  remove dangerous chlorine fluoride and contaminants from municipal water? These filters are powerful

[01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:10.000]  Okay, I want to race through your phone calls now because I haven't gotten into
[01:54:11.840 --> 01:54:16.720]  city governments, state governments, county governments announcing the police can't protect you.
[01:54:18.720 --> 01:54:22.960]  We're going to keep police on staff, but they're just there to write tickets. I mean, that's actually
[01:54:22.960 --> 01:54:31.680]  all over the news. There's big developments on the oil well front, and we'll talk about that as well,
[01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:36.720]  a lot coming up in the next hour. But I would ask callers, what do you think about the CNN host?
[01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:44.720]  In fact, I want to play that one more time. Just the very area of the clip where CNN host Rick
[01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:54.400]  Sanchez last night, yesterday with the CNN program, talking to a CIA officer said that the bombings
[01:54:55.440 --> 01:55:03.040]  in Uganda are good and that it helps us understand how evil Al Qaeda is.
[01:55:03.040 --> 01:55:07.440]  And so if that's the case, so be it. And then we have all these other quotes by people in the
[01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:12.000]  military, newspaper reporters saying how great 9-11 was and how we need another one.
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:16.240]  Well, I'm telling you, I've researched this. We have links to it in the article.
[01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:20.000]  Most of this stuff ends up being government-sponsored, government-staged,
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:24.000]  and they're using it as a pretext to take your rights. Remember the Mayak and Homeland Security
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:29.840]  reports where they're not worried about, you know, turban-headed men 8,000 miles away. They're
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:35.120]  talking about you and your property and your guns because you are a constitutionalist. You
[01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:39.840]  are the enemy of these banks. They've taken over hundreds and hundreds of nations in the last
[01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:45.440]  century. Some nations over and over again, repeatedly. They're ruthless and people better
[01:55:45.440 --> 01:55:49.680]  grow up and realize that. Let's go ahead and play this clip. But you know what's interesting about
[01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:59.040]  this? In a strange way, the event is helpful to the cause of those of us who know how sadistic
[01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:05.600]  these fundamental radical Islamic terrorists are. And if it helps get the message out there
[01:56:05.600 --> 01:56:14.800]  that these are not the good guys, then so be it. Then so be it. So I hope that some of the callers
[01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:20.560]  want to comment on that. David, New York, thanks for holding her on the air. Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:56:20.560 --> 01:56:24.720]  Welcome. You know, while I was unhauled, I thought of something that's probably kind of important.
[01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:30.080]  I was doing work for a guy up in Grafton a few years ago and I always get into, you know,
[01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:36.160]  the stuff we talk about. And he told me that he was proud because his son is the one that came
[01:56:36.160 --> 01:56:40.880]  up with a 30th house flight, 800 went down, and that's the one they went with. So that's all
[01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:45.440]  that consensus for me. You know, he writes the best part in essays, but then they, you know,
[01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:52.000]  turn it into a fact. Anyway, what I really want to talk to you about was next time you take a
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:56.800]  well-deserved vacation, if you could rebroadcast the lady you interviewed that talked about
[01:56:56.800 --> 01:57:02.800]  Oklahoma, the one that went to James Trappican. Yes. In fact, Jane Graham was only on for 30
[01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:07.280]  minutes and I said I would reschedule her. And so we'll set her up for a full hour in the next
[01:57:07.280 --> 01:57:12.240]  few weeks. Guys, let's get Jane Graham back on. The clarity of her was so profound, it was...
[01:57:12.240 --> 01:57:18.240]  No, she was there. She was the head of HUD on that floor. She saw McVeigh planting the bombs.
[01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:23.280]  She saw the black op people. I mean, and many other witnesses saw the same thing.
[01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:27.120]  I'm old to this, but it made my jaw drop just that if you could just, if I could play that to
[01:57:27.120 --> 01:57:32.240]  some of you that never even would believe it, they would believe it. And the other thing is
[01:57:32.240 --> 01:57:37.600]  when Bill Gates was in front of the globalist talking about reducing populations by inoculation,
[01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:44.880]  is that available on DVD or video? You can just simply go to YouTube. It's a TED TV
[01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:51.280]  and you can search. Bill Gates talks about reducing population and you'll get him on a
[01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:56.400]  bunch of different TV programs doing it, including TED TV. I have a Fred Flintstone computer,
[01:57:56.400 --> 01:58:02.160]  but it would dial up. I understand, but I mean, I would imagine you can contact TED TV. They're
[01:58:02.160 --> 01:58:07.360]  big seminar and I bet you can buy it on DVD. Very good. Thank you. Thank you, sir. I appreciate
[01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:12.240]  your call. Again, we're going to go to break and I'm going to come back and go to Matt, Jim, Kevin,
[01:58:12.240 --> 01:58:18.000]  Mike and others. But what do you think of this news where it's Wall Street Journal, New York Times,
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:25.120]  CNN? Hey, the dollar's going to be replaced and it deserves it. Do you blame the bankers,
[01:58:25.120 --> 01:58:30.960]  those great guys? Hey, we just sold roughly the entire gold supply that's produced in one year
[01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:37.760]  and just on and on and on. I mean, everything's accelerating. One day of news is like six months
[01:58:37.760 --> 01:58:47.840]  of news 10 years ago. It's wild. Thank you for listening to GCN. Be sure to visit GCN

[02:00:08.960 --> 02:00:20.960]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas,
[02:00:21.760 --> 02:00:26.880]  Alex Jones. All right, we're racing through your calls that always take us in interesting
[02:00:26.880 --> 02:00:32.400]  directions and then at the bottom of the hour, I will blitz through news and then if we have
[02:00:32.400 --> 02:00:40.880]  time, take a few more calls before that hour ends. Coming up, Fidel Castro has come out and said that
[02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:45.520]  he's afraid World War III is about to start. I want to go over his comments. They're announcing
[02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:49.920]  in Oakland that they're no longer going to respond to most crimes and that's happening in many other
[02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:53.840]  areas of the country and also the legislative BP oil spill. But right now, let's go back to your
[02:00:53.840 --> 02:01:01.680]  calls. Matt, in Minnesota, you're on the air. Hey, Alex. Welcome. Hey, yeah, in regards to Rick Sanchez,
[02:01:01.680 --> 02:01:07.840]  saying I'm CNN. You know, I find it disgusting. It's just like when Glenn Beck said we got to
[02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:13.200]  shoot this POW in the head and the guy in Fox and Friends saying the US should use terrorism and car
[02:01:13.200 --> 02:01:19.440]  bombs in Iran. You know, the woman joking about assassinating Obama and Fox and Bill Riley and
[02:01:19.440 --> 02:01:22.880]  Sean Hannity saying over and over again that terrorism exists because, you know, they hate our
[02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:29.600]  freedom and liberty, women's rights. Like you've pointed out over and over again, I mean, the
[02:01:29.600 --> 02:01:34.720]  mainstream corporate media, the ones calling for violence, not Alex Jones, not Info War, it's not
[02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:39.840]  the Tea Party, not the Oath Keepers, not alternative media. It's the corporate media. They're the ones
[02:01:39.840 --> 02:01:44.560]  always calling for violence. They're calling. I mean, remember four years ago, headlines
[02:01:44.560 --> 02:01:49.360]  where the Bush administration leaked the report that they were going to use hundreds of, quote,
[02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:55.360]  many nukes and they called it a nuclear war that's not nuclear to hit all the military sites in Iran
[02:01:55.360 --> 02:02:01.920]  and people were cheerleading that. I mean, regardless, here's an example. Israel three years ago in
[02:02:01.920 --> 02:02:08.000]  Lebanon used tons and, I mean, calculated out tons and tons. You can pull up the exact number of
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:14.800]  you want. In fact, search engine guys, the amount of DU used in Israeli Lebanon war. But the point
[02:02:14.800 --> 02:02:22.720]  is they use masses of DU munitions and the winds tend to blow from the west to the east
[02:02:22.720 --> 02:02:29.520]  and from the north to the south in Israel. Those are the prevailing winds. And so that DU
[02:02:29.520 --> 02:02:35.600]  blew right back into Israel. You get one width of it. You're going to get lung cancer a year,
[02:02:35.600 --> 02:02:40.800]  five years, 10 years. I've had the former head of the Pentagon DU program on. I mean, this stuff,
[02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:48.000]  you get one width of this. You are dead or do doornail. And even if the Israel wants to kill
[02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:55.040]  all the Lebanese Muslims, what are they doing bombing areas? They're going to kill Lebanese
[02:02:55.040 --> 02:02:59.840]  Christians. And I'm not saying kill anybody. The point is, is it's killing Lebanese Jews,
[02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:06.480]  Christians, Arabs. It's wrong. I mean, these are weapons that are not smart at all. They're the
[02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:12.400]  dumbest weapons in history. And Israel now has been using it in Gaza. Well, what where is Gaza?
[02:03:13.200 --> 02:03:22.720]  It's on the Mediterranean, right up against Egypt. Here's Israel. The jet stream blows right across
[02:03:22.720 --> 02:03:27.920]  major Israeli cities with the DU they used in Gaza. I mean, that's an even better example.
[02:03:27.920 --> 02:03:34.720]  This is lunatic land. And we get demonized for using the cold pepper. Don't tread on meat lag
[02:03:34.720 --> 02:03:40.160]  in the media. But then, meanwhile, they're constantly promoting violence. That's a really
[02:03:40.160 --> 02:03:45.440]  good point. Anything else? Yeah, you know, I just, I mean, like what they did, the UN and
[02:03:45.440 --> 02:03:51.440]  United States, say sanctions in Iraq that, you know, killed some 500,000 people and, you know,
[02:03:51.440 --> 02:03:54.960]  the new war where a million people are dead. I mean, I don't know how much is enough. I mean,
[02:03:54.960 --> 02:04:00.400]  how many people did they want killed in these wars? The fact of the matter is that, I mean,
[02:04:00.400 --> 02:04:05.920]  a majority of the Americans, I mean, not that they're just in a trance, but they're just dehumanized.
[02:04:05.920 --> 02:04:11.840]  I mean, people don't care about free humanity. They don't care about their species at all.
[02:04:13.280 --> 02:04:18.160]  Well, there's a stack of news I'm going to cover at the bottom of the hour that details that. And
[02:04:18.160 --> 02:04:26.480]  this is just, this is just what was in the stack today, where again, another major government
[02:04:26.480 --> 02:04:34.320]  report admitting that aspartame causes women to abort their babies and have miscarriages
[02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:37.920]  and have low birth weights. Well, they knew that with the rhesus monkeys and the green monkeys
[02:04:37.920 --> 02:04:41.680]  and other monkeys, but they tested it on in the 70s. I mean, they know this. That's why it's
[02:04:41.680 --> 02:04:46.320]  put in there. It's a cold-blooded, I've got the White House science are saying we need to do stuff
[02:04:46.320 --> 02:04:51.120]  like this. I mean, these people are monsters. There's a bunch of psychopathic control freak
[02:04:51.120 --> 02:04:57.680]  chicken necks assaulting all of us with soft kill, creepy weapons that these cowards use
[02:04:57.680 --> 02:05:00.640]  so red-blooded people don't know what hit them. We'll be right back.

[02:06:59.760 --> 02:07:05.520]  to wait. This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:07:05.520 --> 02:07:09.840]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:07:09.840 --> 02:07:14.880]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[02:07:14.880 --> 02:07:20.480]  to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[02:07:20.480 --> 02:07:25.600]  is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:07:25.600 --> 02:07:30.880]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous
[02:07:30.880 --> 02:07:35.520]  weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from
[02:07:35.520 --> 02:07:40.720]  weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance
[02:07:40.720 --> 02:07:44.800]  and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from
[02:07:44.800 --> 02:07:50.960]  Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[02:08:24.560 --> 02:08:28.560]  This information is key. Kevin in Oregon, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[02:08:29.520 --> 02:08:31.920]  Hey, Alex. How's it going? Good, sir. Welcome.
[02:08:32.560 --> 02:08:37.760]  I would like to point out the story of Eric Scott in Las Vegas. I wanted to know if you'd
[02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:43.280]  heard about that. My memory doesn't serve. Tell me about it.
[02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:51.200]  He had a legal carry permit, and he was shot by three cops in a Costco.
[02:08:51.200 --> 02:08:57.680]  No. Give us his name again. I see these types of reports, unfortunately, on a weekly basis,
[02:08:57.680 --> 02:09:04.160]  but his name is Eric Scott. Eric Scott with a K, E-R-I-K, Scott.
[02:09:04.160 --> 02:09:10.000]  Eric Scott shot in where? In Las Vegas in a Costco.
[02:09:11.200 --> 02:09:16.240]  And Scott was a West Point grad. He was a Duke University master's degree grad.
[02:09:16.240 --> 02:09:23.920]  Well-respected, and I was thinking he's also a friend of George Knapp from Coast to Coast AM.
[02:09:23.920 --> 02:09:28.160]  Maybe you could get him on and talk about it, but I'll take your comments off there. Thank you,
[02:09:28.160 --> 02:09:36.720]  Alex. We're writing all that down, George Knapp. I have not seen the report, but I have seen reports
[02:09:36.720 --> 02:09:42.880]  all the time where in Texas, you'll have a 243 or a shotgun in your gun rack. You're going dove,
[02:09:42.880 --> 02:09:48.080]  hunting, or whatever, but that's not its main use. It's for self-defense, and the cops pull you over.
[02:09:48.800 --> 02:09:54.240]  They flip out on you. They'll find some reason to arrest you. You see the reports constantly.
[02:09:54.240 --> 02:10:00.800]  It's, again, almost always an old man for some reason. You saw it last week in Colorado,
[02:10:01.520 --> 02:10:05.360]  but nine times a day, it's an old elderly man, usually a veteran, and people break in their
[02:10:05.360 --> 02:10:09.760]  house or break in their property or steal in their car, and they come out and shoot somebody or shoot
[02:10:09.760 --> 02:10:14.640]  them in their house, and they get arrested and charged with murder, not manslaughter, murder.
[02:10:15.760 --> 02:10:22.560]  And I constantly see reports, mainly in New York State, Massachusetts, New Jersey,
[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:27.200]  but I've seen it in Michigan. I've seen it in Texas. I mean, I've seen so many of these that
[02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:32.400]  makes my head spin. I know you've seen them, where it's almost always an old man, because old men
[02:10:32.400 --> 02:10:39.120]  love to tinker, and they got all their tools. Let me tell you, seeing that Clint Eastwood movie,
[02:10:40.800 --> 02:10:45.920]  it's the name of a car, Gran Torino. I've known so many old vets that are literally just like that
[02:10:45.920 --> 02:10:50.320]  guy, that character. That's why that movie is so popular. Everybody knows a character like that,
[02:10:50.320 --> 02:10:54.080]  and you're a kid, and they invite you over to their garage, and everything's all neat and there,
[02:10:54.080 --> 02:10:59.760]  and they teach you how to saw and drill, and you ask them to tell you war stories, and they won't,
[02:10:59.760 --> 02:11:05.760]  but it's almost always that type of guy that you see in Gran Torino, where they'll be in their
[02:11:05.760 --> 02:11:10.080]  garage, their little tinker shop, and they'll be welding, or they'll be sawing, or they'll be doing
[02:11:10.080 --> 02:11:15.360]  woodwork, or they'll be messing with their fly rods, and that's a wonderland when you're a little
[02:11:15.360 --> 02:11:20.000]  kid. I mean, I had grandpas like that. You go in there, their work shed. In fact, my dad's dad had
[02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:26.080]  a work shed with his fly fishing equipment, his bass fishing equipment, and woodwork, and tools,
[02:11:26.080 --> 02:11:32.320]  and tools, and he'd take me in there, and show me stuff, and it's always the same.
[02:11:32.320 --> 02:11:40.400]  You'll have a brainwashed, un-American, domesticated slime ball, and they'll be walking by in rural
[02:11:40.400 --> 02:11:46.720]  areas. It happens a lot in LA. I saw news report a few years ago about this, and they'll see the
[02:11:46.720 --> 02:11:52.560]  person's garage up, and they'll be in there cleaning a rifle. I mean, how many times did I see my
[02:11:52.560 --> 02:11:57.120]  grandfather out in the shed cleaning a rifle? Young people today buy guns, and I've watched
[02:11:57.120 --> 02:12:01.040]  them. They don't even clean them when they go out and shoot them, but those old vets, it was
[02:12:01.040 --> 02:12:04.640]  religious. Let's go clean the rifles, and you get in there, and they're taking them apart.
[02:12:05.600 --> 02:12:09.680]  One of these brainwashed yuppies, or whatever they are, or whatever you want to call them,
[02:12:09.680 --> 02:12:16.400]  these domesticated, gelded creatures who've been castrated, they see you with a gun. And I told
[02:12:16.400 --> 02:12:23.840]  the story. I lived in an apartment in college, and I was going to go deer hunting, and I walked out.
[02:12:23.840 --> 02:12:28.880]  My Mustang was parked with a hatchback right by my door. I was out there maybe five seconds, walked
[02:12:28.880 --> 02:12:36.880]  out, stuck the rifle in the back, stuck a box of shells in there, and forgot something, and came
[02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:40.560]  back ten minutes later, and the police were there. And I said, and they said, have you seen a man with
[02:12:40.560 --> 02:12:45.200]  a gun? It matches your description. I said, yeah, it's a deer rifle, and the cop went, somebody
[02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:50.720]  got scared and called. Okay, and now cops last for a license. This one, I guess, was a patriot,
[02:12:50.720 --> 02:12:54.800]  and said, okay, I just had to come. Have a good one. I'm going hunting this weekend, too. Literally,
[02:12:54.800 --> 02:12:58.880]  that's what happened. One time, we got pulled over for speeding in Waco. It was me and two of my
[02:12:58.880 --> 02:13:05.840]  high school buddies. We were in college. There were two UT football players, Alex, and well,
[02:13:05.840 --> 02:13:10.800]  the point is, we were there, and the cop pulled us over, and there were like 15 guns in the back,
[02:13:10.800 --> 02:13:15.120]  because we wanted to go shoot all of our guns out at my family ranch. We were driving east Texas,
[02:13:15.120 --> 02:13:21.120]  and he looked at them and said, okay, we'll have fun hunting and shooting, but you run into the
[02:13:21.120 --> 02:13:25.200]  wrong cop. They're going to go ahead and, I see it in the news constantly, where they say the man
[02:13:25.200 --> 02:13:29.360]  was arrested for an arsenal, and then I'll go check that state's law, and there's no law against a
[02:13:29.360 --> 02:13:35.200]  arsenal. And I've seen an arsenal be as many as five guns they'll call an arsenal. I've seen them
[02:13:35.200 --> 02:13:40.880]  call 500 rounds of ammo an arsenal. I've seen reports all over the country where now people who buy
[02:13:40.880 --> 02:13:48.000]  over 500 rounds get a Homeland Security visit at their house. And so the subjects you bring up,
[02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:52.960]  I need to go back to calls, but now I'm ranting on this, the subject you bring up just brings to
[02:13:52.960 --> 02:13:57.920]  mind thousands of stories. I mean, every second a new one that I remember reading about or seeing
[02:13:57.920 --> 02:14:06.480]  pops into my mind. And now people all over the country in Nevada and Arizona and Vermont and
[02:14:06.480 --> 02:14:10.480]  other places where it's legal to open carry, they're starting to say, you know what, I'm tired of
[02:14:10.480 --> 02:14:15.280]  you intimidating Second Amendment defenders. I'm tired of you saying our guns are dirty and bad.
[02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:18.800]  We're going to wear these guns openly and the media hates it because how are they going to
[02:14:18.800 --> 02:14:25.680]  demonize it and imply guns are illegal if we start openly carrying them and taking our right back
[02:14:25.680 --> 02:14:33.040]  by exercise and by pressing it. And so I do see those reports where the police just completely
[02:14:33.040 --> 02:14:37.680]  flip out. Of course, there's the famous case I probably told the story 50 times. This was
[02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:45.440]  gotta be 12 years ago. And I had a carpet cleaner in my house and I broadcast out of my house at
[02:14:45.440 --> 02:14:49.680]  the time. I'd already gotten syndicated. I was on about 20 stations at the time and he was in my
[02:14:49.680 --> 02:14:54.560]  broadcast studio and I didn't have children then. So my shotgun was out openly on a double rifle rack,
[02:14:54.560 --> 02:15:00.480]  but it was just a shotgun up there, a Winchester Defender, like a $200 at the time shotgun from
[02:15:01.120 --> 02:15:06.640]  believe I bought that at Oshman's, a special I saw on the paper. And it was a pump shotgun.
[02:15:06.640 --> 02:15:13.360]  And for defense. And the guy ran out and started calling the police on me. And of course, the rest
[02:15:13.360 --> 02:15:20.640]  of that is history. But this is what goes on. And yes, indeed, here is the article. This is CBS
[02:15:20.640 --> 02:15:27.760]  News 8. We'll give folks a document cam shot of this. It says Chris Castillo describes his
[02:15:27.760 --> 02:15:33.040]  co-worker and good friend Eric Scott in glowing terms. He served his country, West Point Grab,
[02:15:33.040 --> 02:15:40.960]  a grad Duke master's degree, a solid business guy. Castillo said Castillo was shocked that Scott was
[02:15:40.960 --> 02:15:46.320]  shot and killed by Metro police Saturday afternoon. It was very, very hard to believe everybody was
[02:15:46.320 --> 02:15:51.440]  in disbelief as to what the heck could have happened. And why Castillo said the 38 year old
[02:15:51.440 --> 02:15:56.560]  medical salesman was shopping for his girlfriend at Costco when police say trouble began.
[02:15:56.560 --> 02:16:05.040]  And what he was doing was removing metal water bottles out of their packages or boxes.
[02:16:05.760 --> 02:16:09.040]  Wow. I mean, I've done that. I was buying something this weekend and to kind of open the
[02:16:09.040 --> 02:16:13.440]  package to look at it. I guess you don't do that. I said Metro police captain Patrick Nebels.
[02:16:14.080 --> 02:16:15.600]  So I guess this veteran's dead for
[02:16:18.560 --> 02:16:23.200]  it's kind of like that line from first blood where they say it'll read on John Rambo's tombstone
[02:16:23.200 --> 02:16:29.840]  killed for jaywalking, killed for loitering. He threw a few of the on the floor and put other
[02:16:29.840 --> 02:16:34.560]  ones within his cart. So it sounds like they're making that up. Yeah, the guys just so he might
[02:16:34.560 --> 02:16:38.240]  have set it there and then somebody got mad because one fell off or something. Who knows.
[02:16:38.240 --> 02:16:42.080]  So don't don't drop something in a store. You're dead. Police say customers complained about Scott's
[02:16:42.080 --> 02:16:45.520]  behavior allegedly argued with security, refused to obey officers when they arrived.
[02:16:46.160 --> 02:16:51.440]  He goes into his waistband area and puts his hands on his weapon is going for the weapon.
[02:16:51.440 --> 02:16:56.160]  Captain Nebel said the officer then begins to issue verbal commands for him to get on the ground,
[02:16:56.160 --> 02:16:59.280]  get on the ground, get on the ground, three officers then fired seven shots.
[02:16:59.280 --> 02:17:02.800]  We have over a dozen witnesses that saw the individual pull a weapon from his waistband.
[02:17:02.800 --> 02:17:09.440]  Captain Nebel said, you know, I love Bill to believe that, but we just, you know, saw the cop
[02:17:09.440 --> 02:17:16.640]  get second degree manslaughter. He'll serve two to four years in Oakland for putting a man in handcuffs
[02:17:16.640 --> 02:17:22.960]  for no reason on a platform and then shooting him in the back and then they rough him up after
[02:17:22.960 --> 02:17:27.280]  they shoot him in the back and then he died. And then they lied and they tried to grab everybody's
[02:17:27.280 --> 02:17:31.920]  cell phone cameras, but people, one guy was down the ramp and got some footage of it and was able
[02:17:31.920 --> 02:17:36.640]  to get away. Somebody else was on a train that stopped and they got it. And they said that the
[02:17:36.640 --> 02:17:40.880]  man had assaulted the officers and was not in handcuffs and had gone for their weapon. And
[02:17:40.880 --> 02:17:44.720]  of course he was in handcuffs on the ground. They were jumping on his head and beating him up and
[02:17:44.720 --> 02:17:49.680]  doing what bullies do, I guess. And then they killed him and then it wasn't enough to kill him.
[02:17:49.680 --> 02:17:56.480]  They lied about him and tried to abscond and engage in conspiracy to cover up the murder.
[02:17:57.360 --> 02:18:03.760]  And so, I mean, who knows if this is true. How many cop car tapes have we seen where the cops plant
[02:18:03.760 --> 02:18:07.280]  drugs on somebody? How many cop car tapes have you seen where they beat the daylights out of
[02:18:07.280 --> 02:18:11.440]  somebody and then file a report that they assaulted them? I mean, how many times have we
[02:18:11.440 --> 02:18:15.280]  seen Austin cops shoot somebody in the back and then lie about it later? And, you know, my issue
[02:18:15.280 --> 02:18:18.960]  is they're hiring a bunch of politically correct cowards who were scared to death of everybody
[02:18:18.960 --> 02:18:23.600]  and they're hiring a bunch of thugs who like to kill people and we don't need that. You know,
[02:18:23.600 --> 02:18:28.560]  we need strong men and women who understand preserving life is everything. And if you're too
[02:18:28.560 --> 02:18:32.400]  scared and are trigger happy because, you know, you think somebody's trying to kill you, don't be a
[02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:39.600]  cop. Okay, you need to be a peace officer, a guardian, not a crazy man. Okay, let's jam in a
[02:18:39.600 --> 02:18:43.680]  call here before we go to break. Let's talk to Mike in Chicago, Mike here on the air.
[02:18:44.480 --> 02:18:48.800]  Hey, Alex, how are you? I'm all right, sir. Since you were talking about firearms, I'm going to
[02:18:48.800 --> 02:18:52.240]  bring it up real quick. And then I got to get to the point that I called you about. Have you ever
[02:18:52.240 --> 02:18:58.240]  heard of the limited life cartridge primers? Yes, I know that the government is moving and
[02:18:58.240 --> 02:19:07.280]  California proposed it a few years ago to have the caps that ignite the powder in the cartridge
[02:19:07.280 --> 02:19:13.520]  to have those failed. After five years, I believe was the bill I saw. Now they already have it where
[02:19:13.520 --> 02:19:19.040]  any guns sold in California have to be stamped with the weapons serial number, which also
[02:19:20.480 --> 02:19:24.560]  just basically makes most gun manufacturers not selling California. But go ahead.
[02:19:25.680 --> 02:19:29.760]  If you read the patent description online, limited life cartridge primers, it tells you
[02:19:29.760 --> 02:19:33.920]  that the reason that they came up with the idea is so that citizens couldn't stockpile ammunition.
[02:19:33.920 --> 02:19:39.200]  But that wasn't the reason I called. Two hits that are going to come to the financial markets
[02:19:39.200 --> 02:19:42.880]  in our economy in general. Stay there. Stay there. I got to come back to you, Mike.
[02:19:42.880 --> 02:19:47.040]  Then Terry, Bev, Jim and George, and that'll probably be it. I'll at least get to those calls.
[02:19:47.840 --> 02:19:51.920]  But then I've got to blitz through news in this hour because there is so much
[02:19:51.920 --> 02:19:59.360]  key info coming up and I am committed to cover it. We'll be right back. Great job, crew. Stay with us.
[02:19:59.360 --> 02:20:06.560]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:20:06.560 --> 02:20:10.880]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:20:10.880 --> 02:20:15.920]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[02:20:15.920 --> 02:20:21.520]  to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[02:20:21.520 --> 02:20:26.640]  is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:20:26.640 --> 02:20:31.360]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four,
[02:20:31.360 --> 02:20:35.920]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose
[02:20:35.920 --> 02:20:40.720]  their power from weather related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful
[02:20:40.720 --> 02:20:45.200]  backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by
[02:20:45.200 --> 02:20:51.920]  Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[02:22:18.080 --> 02:22:23.600]  of possibilities. It means all the world under their control. The United Nations would take over
[02:22:23.600 --> 02:22:29.600]  America. The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world. Invisible Empire Chronicles, how men
[02:22:29.600 --> 02:22:34.560]  of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world
[02:22:34.560 --> 02:22:39.360]  government. I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for
[02:22:39.360 --> 02:22:43.920]  the global financial system. Global governance with the establishment of the G20. So it's going
[02:22:43.920 --> 02:22:49.600]  to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else. And I got news for you. You're everyone else.

[02:24:12.240 --> 02:24:20.640]  Okay, Mike, in Chicago, go ahead and get to your next point, sir. Okay, the two big hits that we're
[02:24:20.640 --> 02:24:23.840]  going to see towards the end of the year are going to be the option adjustable rate mortgages
[02:24:23.840 --> 02:24:28.240]  coming to maturity. A lot of that is going to be commercial real estate, but that's going to be
[02:24:28.240 --> 02:24:34.320]  another big hit to the real estate market. The Bush tax cuts from early 2000, 2003 expire at the
[02:24:34.320 --> 02:24:38.720]  end of the year. And lastly, knowing that the incumbents are on their way out, what do you
[02:24:38.720 --> 02:24:43.920]  think the chances of the American people going to the polls in a state of duress is? Because the
[02:24:43.920 --> 02:24:48.560]  system is absolutely terrified that people are going to kick out the incumbents. So what is your
[02:24:48.560 --> 02:24:55.840]  opinion on us going to the polls in a state of duress? Well, I tell you, I have never thought
[02:24:55.840 --> 02:25:00.720]  that they would actually suspend elections, though we've heard rumors about it. But the way they're
[02:25:00.720 --> 02:25:07.440]  going to use this oil spill, the way it's going to be peaking right during hurricane season in
[02:25:07.440 --> 02:25:13.280]  November with that oil coming ashore in the months leading up to that. And the way they're gearing
[02:25:13.280 --> 02:25:17.680]  up the attack on Iran, it looks like for right around election time. And government documents,
[02:25:17.680 --> 02:25:21.760]  of course, have been declassified about the October surprise and how right before elections,
[02:25:21.760 --> 02:25:26.560]  they like to stage crises. And it looks like they're gearing up a total financial collapse
[02:25:27.360 --> 02:25:32.640]  for October, November. That's even in the mainstream news, a war with Iran for October, November,
[02:25:32.640 --> 02:25:39.120]  and that oil coming ashore in September, October, November. And more and more the media is talking
[02:25:39.120 --> 02:25:44.160]  about forced evacuations. The scope of them is not known. But clearly those preparations are being
[02:25:44.160 --> 02:25:49.600]  made. And so I think what you're getting at is you're saying you don't see them letting us go
[02:25:49.600 --> 02:25:55.120]  into the polls with the Democrats set to lose the House and Senate and the Republicans that are
[02:25:55.120 --> 02:25:59.360]  getting elected are anti-establishment in almost all these races like Rand Paul and others.
[02:25:59.360 --> 02:26:04.240]  And pro-government Democrats, pro-corruption Democrats, are losing their primaries as well
[02:26:04.240 --> 02:26:09.520]  in all these primaries. So the evidence is this is the biggest political realignment
[02:26:09.520 --> 02:26:15.600]  since 1776. And I'm not the only one saying that. This is a complete awakening that is just
[02:26:15.600 --> 02:26:21.520]  beginning right now. And I don't think World War III is going to cut it. I don't think oil spill
[02:26:21.520 --> 02:26:26.960]  martial law is going to get it done. I don't think a total collapse of the economy will get it done.
[02:26:26.960 --> 02:26:30.720]  People know who the enemy is now. They understand a bunch of Bernie Madoff,
[02:26:30.720 --> 02:26:35.680]  Kinley type scammers are running everything. But the system isn't going to give up and they're
[02:26:35.680 --> 02:26:41.280]  going to go ahead with all this. So it's two speed trains going 150 miles an hour apiece,
[02:26:41.280 --> 02:26:46.720]  total speed 300. When they connect, it's going to be hellish. And so that's why I'm saying
[02:26:46.720 --> 02:26:51.680]  everybody can feel the hair on the back of their neck stand up in their spirit. You can
[02:26:51.680 --> 02:26:58.240]  feel it your gut, not just in the news. This is an incredible time. This is the exact same
[02:26:58.240 --> 02:27:03.520]  atmosphere we had pre-World War I, pre-World War II. I mean, this is it. This is the,
[02:27:03.520 --> 02:27:06.000]  this is, I mean, I don't know what to say. What's your take?
[02:27:07.280 --> 02:27:12.400]  They're really, I can't add any more to it. We're aligned perfectly. And I don't see the system.
[02:27:12.880 --> 02:27:16.800]  They're not going to relinquish control. They've got their computerized voting in place.
[02:27:16.800 --> 02:27:18.720]  They could rig elections, but nobody's going to fight it.
[02:27:18.720 --> 02:27:22.720]  Yeah, they planned all this. They planned for the awakening. That's what Homeland Security is.
[02:27:22.720 --> 02:27:26.560]  That's why in all the secret documents, they hate the citizens and are trying to take over
[02:27:26.560 --> 02:27:29.760]  every city. That's why they're suddenly putting troops all over the street and saying, oh, we're
[02:27:29.760 --> 02:27:33.760]  here to help. We're drunk driving. We're here to help get guns. I mean, they're, but the troops
[02:27:33.760 --> 02:27:38.000]  are waking up. I mean, I, they plan for us to get awake and angry, but I don't think
[02:27:38.800 --> 02:27:42.640]  they plan for it to be this big. And they admit that as Brzezinski said a month ago,
[02:27:42.640 --> 02:27:46.880]  two months ago. And so the battle is joined. I mean, this is history right now. We're living,
[02:27:46.880 --> 02:27:52.000]  we're going to look back on this five years from now, and we're going to say, my God,
[02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:55.200]  what about a done more? What about a worn more people? What if we would have,
[02:27:55.200 --> 02:27:59.440]  all of us who are even patriots and awake had realized just how real this is because we have
[02:27:59.440 --> 02:28:05.840]  a psychological weakness, myself included, that because we're informed and know what's going on
[02:28:05.840 --> 02:28:10.320]  and have been so informed for so long, we're almost comfortable with it. It's like somebody who's
[02:28:10.320 --> 02:28:14.240]  dying of cancer for a year. Generally, they're ready for it by the end, but somebody who dies
[02:28:14.240 --> 02:28:18.480]  in a month generally freaking out when they die. So it's kind of, we've been waiting to die as a
[02:28:18.480 --> 02:28:22.080]  country and we've been seeing it happen. Those of us that are informed. So we almost to the
[02:28:22.080 --> 02:28:26.240]  subconscious level expect it and just want to get it over with. Well, we better get the word
[02:28:26.240 --> 02:28:32.640]  out now so we can survive this because this is, I mean, if we have a full-born collapse
[02:28:32.640 --> 02:28:36.800]  depression here and seven million starved to death in the depression in the thirties,
[02:28:36.800 --> 02:28:41.680]  what's going to happen this time when people were much more moral and much more sophisticated
[02:28:41.680 --> 02:28:46.560]  and much more self-sufficient? 70 years ago, what is going to happen now?
[02:28:47.680 --> 02:28:52.800]  Absolutely. You know, if anybody actually wants to try and prove whether or not that we actually
[02:28:52.800 --> 02:28:57.280]  don't have a two-party system, the easiest way to look at it is how we've gotten to where we are
[02:28:57.280 --> 02:29:01.200]  now. If you go back and you look at the trade agreements, NAFTA, the framework agreements
[02:29:01.200 --> 02:29:06.480]  for NAFTA were signed by Bush 41, Bush senior, then Clinton came in since Bush didn't get re-elected
[02:29:06.480 --> 02:29:14.960]  and signed it into law. We've been tossed by both parties over and over. They are a championship
[02:29:14.960 --> 02:29:21.280]  relay Olympic team level skill. They pass it on perfectly and they have fake fights, but it's
[02:29:21.280 --> 02:29:25.840]  incredible. The fence is on the way to the slaughterhouse and they just keep the cattle
[02:29:25.840 --> 02:29:30.800]  bouncing in between the fences and the end result is going to be really bad for everybody.
[02:29:30.800 --> 02:29:34.080]  I don't even want to put it into words, but it is going to be really bad for everybody.
[02:29:34.080 --> 02:29:39.440]  We're really heading towards it, they've got it. Well, we just better get the word out now
[02:29:39.440 --> 02:29:43.280]  like our lives depend on it, folks, because in all of you that work for the government and these
[02:29:43.280 --> 02:29:48.880]  corporations, you better decide right now what side you're on because this is serious.

[02:33:32.560 --> 02:33:37.680]  I'm going to finish up with Terry Bev George, Chris and Jeremy, but Mike was bringing up
[02:33:37.680 --> 02:33:41.200]  so many hardcore issues. I burned a lot of time with him. So I'm going to give each caller about
[02:33:41.200 --> 02:33:45.520]  a minute and a half because I've got to get to all this news. I've made a commitment to cover
[02:33:45.520 --> 02:33:49.840]  everything I put on my plate every day to cover it because I've done an analysis and
[02:33:49.840 --> 02:33:53.920]  notice we're covering about a third. I've already covered about 70% of the news I wanted to cover

[02:35:36.800 --> 02:35:43.200]  your calls. Terry in Georgia, you're on the air. Hello, Alex. Glad to hear you on the radio. Good
[02:35:43.200 --> 02:35:50.240]  to have you, sir. What's on your mind? Quick question. I hadn't heard anything else anywhere
[02:35:50.240 --> 02:35:58.320]  on the internet or regular TV. Why ain't anybody talking about the oil reaching the Atlantic already?
[02:35:59.280 --> 02:36:06.640]  Yes, I did see last Thursday and Friday that they have now found oil in Georgia beaches and other
[02:36:06.640 --> 02:36:12.480]  places. They were debating whether or not that was oil from the Gulf spill, but they've now confirmed
[02:36:12.480 --> 02:36:17.280]  it is hitting Texas. They tried to spin that at first. It is hitting areas of the East Coast.
[02:36:18.080 --> 02:36:23.200]  And we know, as of about two weeks ago, some of it had passed through the keys. Here's Florida,
[02:36:23.200 --> 02:36:27.120]  here's the keys, here's Cuba, hitting some Cuban beaches and hitting some of the keys,
[02:36:27.920 --> 02:36:33.200]  but so that is happening. Yes, sir. I sent you an email about a week ago that might have been
[02:36:33.200 --> 02:36:38.640]  some of the information you picked up on. I've got some proof of it. My wife was on the beach at
[02:36:38.640 --> 02:36:43.760]  St. Simon's Island. I was just wondering if it was any way I could get it sent to you.
[02:36:44.800 --> 02:36:48.160]  You know, that's some of the most beautiful areas in America there and Georgia I've been there.
[02:36:49.360 --> 02:36:53.440]  And I also, you know, I mean, like that whole area going up into the Carolinas,
[02:36:53.440 --> 02:36:57.920]  what a shame that that's going on. But I mean, is it articles? Is it video? What are you trying to
[02:36:57.920 --> 02:37:03.600]  send me? My wife took a couple of pictures of the sign, you know, of St. Simon's, so you know
[02:37:03.600 --> 02:37:10.160]  that's where it was, but a couple of like five, between five and 15 second videos.
[02:37:10.960 --> 02:37:16.480]  Okay. Send them, send them, send them right now to show tips at infowars.com. Can you send
[02:37:16.480 --> 02:37:22.560]  them right now and the guys will get in there? Okay. And God bless you. Anything else? No, sir.
[02:37:22.560 --> 02:37:26.960]  That's it. All right. Thank you. First, you don't succeed to get through to us. Try, try again.
[02:37:26.960 --> 02:37:31.680]  That's why I love taking your calls. Bev in Canada, you're on the air. Hi, Alex. Thanks for waking
[02:37:31.680 --> 02:37:36.960]  me up in April. I want to say that just quick comment before I ask my question, Rick Sanchez,
[02:37:36.960 --> 02:37:41.520]  what an ignorant, ignorant puppet to the advanced new world order agenda. Well, for those who just
[02:37:41.520 --> 02:37:48.400]  joined us, tell folks what you heard him say. Well, that killing is a good, good thing for the
[02:37:48.400 --> 02:37:55.600]  new, you know, to advance show us the Muslims really are our enemy. Come on. You know, I stop
[02:37:55.600 --> 02:38:01.440]  watching CNN because of their blatant lies a long time ago. I left a polite comment on Facebook
[02:38:01.440 --> 02:38:06.400]  regarding Peter Mansbridge, which is a reporter here in Canada who attended the Bilderberg.
[02:38:06.400 --> 02:38:11.520]  All of a sudden my account for Facebook just disappeared. Well, Facebook admits, Facebook
[02:38:11.520 --> 02:38:16.480]  admits it does censor political speech, even stuff that doesn't violate their terms of use
[02:38:16.480 --> 02:38:20.720]  agreement. And the governments have all announced they want to start censoring the web more. So
[02:38:20.720 --> 02:38:24.880]  I'm sorry to hear that happen, Bev. Yeah, well, they're doing it. I wanted to ask you, Alex,
[02:38:24.880 --> 02:38:31.040]  have you read a publication released in 1902-1903? It truly outlines the combination of all the
[02:38:31.040 --> 02:38:36.720]  current events. It's called the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion. Oh, of course I've read
[02:38:36.720 --> 02:38:42.480]  that. I've even bought a copy once because I was in a Walmart probably 15 years ago when they were
[02:38:42.480 --> 02:38:49.040]  selling them there. And the providence of those is questioned. I mean, did the Tsars write it to
[02:38:49.040 --> 02:38:56.240]  demonize Zionist groups in Russia or are they real? Whether they're real or not, everything
[02:38:56.240 --> 02:39:02.000]  that's in there is what government is the type of tricks governments using. But everything in
[02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:07.200]  there has also been used for a long time before that by other governments. But it's certainly
[02:39:07.200 --> 02:39:13.360]  an interesting read. But I don't really get into it a lot because of the providence of it.
[02:39:13.360 --> 02:39:17.600]  I mean, who knows? I mean, somebody could write something and say that, you know,
[02:39:17.600 --> 02:39:20.880]  Obama had written it, but I need to see the proof. Somebody could write something and say,
[02:39:20.880 --> 02:39:26.080]  you'd written it, Bev. But I'd want to see the proof of who wrote it. But the information in it,
[02:39:26.080 --> 02:39:31.280]  about how groups manipulate and how mafias control things, I think it's pretty informative.
[02:39:31.920 --> 02:39:35.360]  It is. It is. Thank you very much, Alex, for taking my call.
[02:39:35.360 --> 02:39:38.400]  All right. I appreciate your call. You know, I think all information
[02:39:39.280 --> 02:39:44.960]  is informative. I mean, learning and just thinking about how governments manipulate,
[02:39:44.960 --> 02:39:49.760]  thinking about how governments and groups and organizations engage in propaganda.
[02:39:49.760 --> 02:39:53.200]  Because, you know, regardless of what's gone on in the past or is happening currently,
[02:39:53.200 --> 02:39:57.680]  just by researching, say, Edward Bernays and the book he wrote, Propaganda.
[02:39:57.680 --> 02:40:03.920]  I mean, it's incredible. And we know he wrote it. He published it. Or David Rockefeller published
[02:40:03.920 --> 02:40:07.280]  a book saying he wants World Government, the overthrow of the U.S. I mean, you know,
[02:40:07.280 --> 02:40:12.160]  that is where they admit they've written it. So I appreciate your call.
[02:40:12.880 --> 02:40:16.800]  Let's go ahead and talk to George in Connecticut. George, you're on the air.
[02:40:16.800 --> 02:40:25.040]  George, you're running these a week. And why can't you pull some of your friends out there?
[02:40:25.040 --> 02:40:28.080]  Maybe they can do something like, I don't know, any from Monday.
[02:40:29.600 --> 02:40:33.600]  I'm going to have to let you go, George, your sky for whatever it is, just unintelligible.
[02:40:33.600 --> 02:40:37.040]  I heard you talk about my friends. That's about all I could get. Sorry.
[02:40:37.040 --> 02:40:39.280]  Let's talk to Chris in Florida. Chris, you're on the air.
[02:40:39.280 --> 02:40:46.560]  Chris was a new case of the defector, the Iranian scientist, the nuclear physicist,
[02:40:46.560 --> 02:40:52.080]  and his original claim that he was kidnapped and his wife claiming the same thing.
[02:40:52.720 --> 02:40:57.200]  You'd think that the government or Justice Department were interested in human rights,
[02:40:57.200 --> 02:41:02.000]  that they would investigate whether he was still credible or not. But, you know,
[02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:06.800]  it's reminiscent of curveball. Remember, the Germans warned us, it was insane,
[02:41:06.800 --> 02:41:12.000]  and they came out and let us know after the invasion of Iraq that, yeah, we warned you at
[02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:18.240]  the U.S. that he was insane and incredible. But, you know, our duplicitousness is just borne out
[02:41:18.240 --> 02:41:25.120]  by this Brazilian letter to the Brazilian president dated May 17th that contradicts
[02:41:25.120 --> 02:41:31.440]  the policy of us on April 20th, saying that, yeah, we were for the deal with Brazil and Turkey,
[02:41:31.440 --> 02:41:37.760]  the enriched Iranian, your textile materials. And so, you know, it just shows that nobody in
[02:41:37.760 --> 02:41:43.920]  our government really ever did want peace. Well, it's now admitted that this guy who disappeared
[02:41:43.920 --> 02:41:51.200]  14 months ago in Saudi Arabia, this Iranian nuclear physicist, showed up at a embassy
[02:41:51.920 --> 02:41:57.440]  and is now wanting to go back to Iran. My issue is, if they grabbed a scientist
[02:41:57.440 --> 02:42:03.600]  and then he wouldn't lie for them, they'd just kill him. And so, I tend to lean towards, but I
[02:42:03.600 --> 02:42:08.000]  have no proof of this, and we don't know that they wouldn't just let him go and then have him run
[02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:12.400]  around and talk about how he was, you know, held in Communicado and now has just been released.
[02:42:12.400 --> 02:42:16.240]  I mean, they kill whoever they want. And our government admittedly runs terror attacks every
[02:42:16.240 --> 02:42:21.280]  week inside Iran and puts out press releases about it begging Iran to strike back, talk about a
[02:42:21.280 --> 02:42:28.320]  provocation. So, I don't know. I mean, I find it very strange they let him go, but stranger
[02:42:28.320 --> 02:42:32.640]  things have happened. And maybe too many people in the government knew he'd been grabbed,
[02:42:32.640 --> 02:42:36.880]  so they had to let him go. And maybe he's telling the truth. I don't know. I think we'll
[02:42:36.880 --> 02:42:40.400]  find out more in the balance of time, the fullness of time. Thank you for the call.
[02:42:41.200 --> 02:42:46.160]  Jeremy and Marilyn, go ahead quickly. Hello, Mr. Jones. How you doing?
[02:42:46.160 --> 02:42:50.400]  Doing all right. How can I serve you? Yes, sir. Well, the reason I'm calling today is I don't know
[02:42:50.400 --> 02:42:54.480]  if you guys have heard about the, you know, I don't know if I'm sounding right here at the
[02:42:54.480 --> 02:43:00.560]  Siderro mudflow that's in East Java, Indonesia. Have you guys heard about that?
[02:43:00.560 --> 02:43:05.200]  No, but we'll start changing the Siderro mudflow or mudflow in Indonesia. What's going on with
[02:43:05.200 --> 02:43:09.200]  the mudflow? All right, well, I'll tell you what's going on here. In 2006, there was a drilling
[02:43:09.200 --> 02:43:15.200]  accident there. And what had happened, and they're blaming the accident on an earthquake,
[02:43:15.200 --> 02:43:24.160]  approximately one million cubic feet of mud are being expelled every day and will continue for
[02:43:24.160 --> 02:43:30.160]  the next 30 years. And their government is covering it up. Thanks to Facebook and communication
[02:43:30.160 --> 02:43:35.440]  with people that I talked to in Indonesia. It's a lot similar to what's going on in our country
[02:43:35.440 --> 02:43:39.520]  right now with our... Well, there have been a lot of mega industrial disasters, and a lot of times
[02:43:39.520 --> 02:43:45.360]  they are triggered by earthquakes. And we need to try to mitigate it and stop it from happening when
[02:43:45.360 --> 02:43:50.080]  we can. But at the same time, this is part of living on this planet. The planet's tough and
[02:43:50.080 --> 02:43:54.480]  will clean itself up, but we'll look into that mudflow. There it is. Scientists blame drilling
[02:43:54.480 --> 02:44:02.960]  for Indonesian mudflow MSNBC in 2008, and that's an associated press. But you're saying from your
[02:44:02.960 --> 02:44:07.760]  research two years later, this is still going on. Yep, it's supposed to be going on for approximately
[02:44:07.760 --> 02:44:12.640]  30 more years. This mud volcano is supposed to be flowing out of the ground, and it was a drilling
[02:44:12.640 --> 02:44:16.560]  accident that supposedly caused it. Well, that might not tell what's happening in the Gulf,
[02:44:16.560 --> 02:44:19.440]  because that sure doesn't look like any crude oil I've ever seen. Most of it coming out looks like
[02:44:19.440 --> 02:44:24.480]  mud. I appreciate your call. Yeah, there's another one, Los Angeles Times, Indonesia's mud volcano
[02:44:24.480 --> 02:44:34.160]  flows on. And that's July... That's July 10th, 2010. So three days ago confirmed. Thank you,
[02:44:34.160 --> 02:44:38.960]  caller. That's why I love the calls. They bring up a lot of issues we haven't gotten to. Okay,
[02:44:38.960 --> 02:44:46.480]  I can't get to the last callers. Sorry, but we've got to be able to finish up now with the news
[02:44:46.480 --> 02:44:51.600]  here. Talk about an endless flow. We could just take calls for eternity. So many great listeners
[02:44:51.600 --> 02:44:56.560]  out there, but we'll try to get back with Eddie and Scott and others, of course, tomorrow because
[02:44:56.560 --> 02:45:05.360]  I got a bunch of news I need to get to now and cover. Let me go ahead and start with this stack
[02:45:05.360 --> 02:45:14.400]  of news. And this is a public health warning. If I wanted to do three, four, five, six hours a day
[02:45:14.400 --> 02:45:18.400]  just with mainstream news admitting that cell phones are giving you brain cancer,
[02:45:18.400 --> 02:45:23.440]  that sodium fluoride is giving you diabetes and cancer and bone cancer and bone fractures
[02:45:23.440 --> 02:45:30.560]  and arthritis. I could spend many hours a day just reporting on the melamine and other toxins in
[02:45:30.560 --> 02:45:35.040]  our food coming in from China and food additives that get made in China and then shipped here and
[02:45:35.040 --> 02:45:39.920]  put in our food or 90 plus percent of the vaccines and drugs being made in China. And all the problems
[02:45:39.920 --> 02:45:47.680]  are how they're now admitting the Prozac's causing brain tumors, heart attacks. This is just the
[02:45:47.680 --> 02:45:54.880]  stuff without even looking that I ran into today. Fox News, FDA panel to review safety of diabetes
[02:45:54.880 --> 02:46:00.480]  drug Avandian. And it goes on to say, ahead of hearings, FDA scientists have blasted a study
[02:46:00.480 --> 02:46:06.880]  by drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline using to defend the safety of the once high-riding diabetes drug,
[02:46:06.880 --> 02:46:11.200]  which fell out of favor because of potential ties to heart attacks. Then it goes into the actual
[02:46:11.200 --> 02:46:17.440]  studies. It's very clear. In fact, the FDA reviewer said the study actually makes the case against
[02:46:17.440 --> 02:46:22.560]  leaving Avandia on the market. Now, what did that ring a bell with? Hundreds of other studies
[02:46:24.080 --> 02:46:26.480]  over and over and over again, examples of this.
[02:46:29.680 --> 02:46:34.480]  And that brings us to our next story. We've read these studies on air. We've had medical doctors
[02:46:34.480 --> 02:46:41.520]  and toxicologists on dealing with it. Aspartame in the 60s was discovered by the Pentagon. They
[02:46:41.520 --> 02:46:49.040]  were working on chemical weapons for a type of E. coli bacteria that could eat toxic chemicals
[02:46:49.040 --> 02:46:55.920]  and then secrete a poison. And they came up with Aspartame. Searle was then bought by Monsanto
[02:46:57.200 --> 02:47:04.240]  in the late 1970s. And of course, the CEO of that at the time was Donald Rumsfeld. And they used
[02:47:04.880 --> 02:47:10.000]  studies done by Searle to get approval. It had failed several times to get approval.
[02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:20.400]  And Reagan in 81 put the former top scientist of Monsanto over the Food and Drug Administration.
[02:47:20.400 --> 02:47:26.000]  And they approved Aspartame. Now, back then it was patented. The patent hadn't run out. And it was
[02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:32.880]  only in Coke and Pepsi and in the little equal and neutral suite packages. Those were the two
[02:47:32.880 --> 02:47:37.680]  brand names. Two licenses were issued for companies Coke and Pepsi to put it out. And then
[02:47:37.680 --> 02:47:45.920]  they're subdirectives with equal and neutral suite. And they knew that, and you can go pull these up,
[02:47:45.920 --> 02:47:50.800]  the vast majority of the different types of monkeys, they did it in multiple groups,
[02:47:51.680 --> 02:47:56.800]  rhesus monkeys, green monkeys were several of them, that they fed Aspartame to when they were
[02:47:56.800 --> 02:48:01.440]  pregnant. They would have miscarriages, low birth weight, deformities, all sorts of problems in
[02:48:01.440 --> 02:48:08.720]  the rhesus monkeys. Then they would feed it to control groups, a smaller amount of Aspartame in
[02:48:08.720 --> 02:48:13.680]  monkey milk and in the mother's milk, a larger amount and then none in just one of the studies.
[02:48:13.680 --> 02:48:16.560]  And they would get brain tumors, they would die of cancer, and the numbers were off the
[02:48:16.560 --> 02:48:22.400]  charts. You can go pull up the studies. And they used those studies to get it approved.
[02:48:24.880 --> 02:48:28.800]  That's how corrupt the FDA is. And so that's what they're saying here. I mean, it doesn't matter
[02:48:28.800 --> 02:48:33.600]  if it's Gardasil. In the trials, it kills a bunch of people. They give it approved. In the 1980s,
[02:48:33.600 --> 02:48:40.560]  early 1980s, Prozac was causing people to commit suicide. It was toxic, causing heart attacks.
[02:48:40.560 --> 02:48:47.680]  They got it approved. And this is what they do over and over and over and over again. And then
[02:48:47.680 --> 02:48:52.240]  a decade later, they pull it off the market. But not with Aspartame and others, but here's the mail
[02:48:52.240 --> 02:48:59.760]  online today. And the headline is actually a whitewash. It says, do sweeteners bring on early
[02:48:59.760 --> 02:49:07.520]  birth how fizzy drinks can harm an unborn child? Talk about deception. It's not fizzy drinks that
[02:49:07.520 --> 02:49:14.720]  can hurt an unborn child. It's not fizzy drinks. It's not carbon dioxide, carbonated water,
[02:49:15.680 --> 02:49:22.160]  beverages. It is the Aspartame. And they later admit research funded by the EU found a correlation
[02:49:22.160 --> 02:49:27.120]  between the amount of diet drink consumed and an early birth among the 60,000 women study.
[02:49:27.680 --> 02:49:31.920]  Many had switched from sugary drinks to those artificial sweeteners believing they
[02:49:31.920 --> 02:49:38.000]  would be healthier option. And it says Aspartame carried a dangers for unborn children. I mean,
[02:49:38.880 --> 02:49:42.160]  of course, they already knew this. And you read the study. It's much worse than the article.
[02:49:42.800 --> 02:49:47.520]  Okay, so that's what we're talking about here. When I get up here on air and I tell you,
[02:49:48.320 --> 02:49:51.920]  because here's the deal. I keep saying it's in thousands. I looked it up last night. It's in
[02:49:51.920 --> 02:49:58.080]  over 14,000 current products sold in the United States. My children in gas stations will want
[02:49:58.080 --> 02:50:07.360]  a road trip bag for candy. Almost every candy, not just gum, it's sugar gum, sugar lollipops.
[02:50:07.360 --> 02:50:12.000]  It says Aspartame on the label. My cousin was down here from Chicago, great guy,
[02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:14.720]  and he was chewing a brand of gum. I said, that's got aspirin. He said, no, it doesn't. I said,
[02:50:14.720 --> 02:50:17.680]  give me the pack. I said, Aspartame. He goes, my gosh, this is a sugar gum.
[02:50:17.680 --> 02:50:22.240]  They found out in the last decade, I mean, I've got a 60 minute program admitting it
[02:50:22.240 --> 02:50:27.280]  causes brain damage and they knew it. I mean, they, it's admitted. And their answer is, oh,
[02:50:27.280 --> 02:50:31.200]  you don't like this. We're going to put it in everything. People started getting awake in
[02:50:31.200 --> 02:50:38.960]  the last 15 years or so to the cytotoxin that is MSG. Just totally deadly. Their answer is,
[02:50:38.960 --> 02:50:44.400]  they call it yeast extract now and everything you eat. When you try to avoid this stuff,
[02:50:44.400 --> 02:50:50.400]  they just put it in more. And I'll tell you, Aspartame, all this stuff costs more than regular
[02:50:50.400 --> 02:50:57.120]  sweeteners like sugar. And then of course, why is corn syrup bad? Because half of the corn syrup
[02:50:57.120 --> 02:51:04.720]  out there has mercury in it. We'll be right back. Protect your freedoms and be independent by

[02:54:13.280 --> 02:54:22.400]  ladies and gentlemen. If you leave me. This isn't like caffeine or nicotine folks. This is much
[02:54:22.400 --> 02:54:30.720]  worse. And I won't ever take you back. Care about your family. You better read the labels. Girl,
[02:54:30.720 --> 02:54:37.680]  your memory. Of course, their answer is. Won't ever haunt me. Don't let you know what's in it.
[02:54:37.680 --> 02:54:47.120]  Here's an article out of natural news. Aspartame has been renamed and is now being marketed as a
[02:54:47.120 --> 02:54:54.720]  natural sweetener. Aminosweet. You can get whole scoop loads of it. Aminosweet. Here's another one,
[02:54:54.720 --> 02:54:59.360]  McClatchy newspapers, and there's a bunch of studies on this. They have a genetically engineered cross
[02:54:59.360 --> 02:55:07.840]  species about to be approved salmon. And the Purdue University study found that if you put 60
[02:55:07.840 --> 02:55:14.640]  transgenetic, that's not even a clone. It's a mix of species, insect, chains, fish bred in a population
[02:55:14.640 --> 02:55:19.760]  of 60,000 wild fish. The wild fish will become extinct within 40 generations. That's within 40
[02:55:19.760 --> 02:55:24.800]  years. They have one generation a year. But in a tank, they do it faster. And it goes on to talk
[02:55:24.800 --> 02:55:30.400]  about the advanced hybrid. So there you have it, ladies and gentlemen. And of course, all the studies
[02:55:30.400 --> 02:55:36.160]  show that this is designed to take over the entire biosphere to have a corporate monopoly on all
[02:55:36.160 --> 02:55:43.760]  life forms. But I am basically out of time on that subject. There was another big study out.
[02:55:43.760 --> 02:55:48.480]  Pharmacists give themselves cancer from dispensing toxic chemotherapy chemicals. All they are is
[02:55:48.480 --> 02:55:52.320]  basically pesticides that cost a few dollars, but they sell them for thousands of dollars per
[02:55:52.320 --> 02:55:56.640]  treatment. And just being around it, getting a drop of it on your finger, cumulatively,
[02:55:56.640 --> 02:56:01.200]  gives you cancer. Why? Pharmacists are dying of cancer. So enjoy yourselves there.
[02:56:01.200 --> 02:56:06.720]  Then a big article, depopulation fanatics, eugenics, launch objective global population study.
[02:56:06.720 --> 02:56:12.160]  That's from infowars.com and prisonpunet.com with Steve Watson. Now, this subject I'm going to talk
[02:56:12.160 --> 02:56:17.360]  more about in days to come. We're going to get some guests on concerning it. But every week or so,
[02:56:17.360 --> 02:56:23.200]  I see a new county, a new city. Here's one out of Cleveland, Ohio in the county of,
[02:56:23.200 --> 02:56:30.400]  how do you pronounce this, guys? Ashta. Ashta Tubler. People in Ohio are going to go,
[02:56:30.400 --> 02:56:38.640]  get it right, you moron. A-S-H-T-A-B-L-U-A county. Ashta Bula County. Judge tells residents to
[02:56:38.640 --> 02:56:44.080]  arm themselves. They're cutting the deputies from 112 to 49 deputies and saying almost all the
[02:56:44.080 --> 02:56:48.240]  deputies will be used for the prison and for revenue generation. There'll be one deputy per
[02:56:48.240 --> 02:56:53.440]  chef to respond to crime. So you pay for 49 deputies and you get three a day because there's one per
[02:56:53.440 --> 02:56:59.040]  chef or three shifts a day. And he's being honest and saying buy guns. Now, this isn't just some
[02:56:59.040 --> 02:57:05.520]  county in Ohio doing this. Here is NBC. Suffer these criminals in Oakland. Don't call the cops.
[02:57:06.320 --> 02:57:11.440]  This is layoffs effective at midnight, barring last minute deals. So they hold you hostage.
[02:57:11.440 --> 02:57:14.400]  They say we're not going to be able to respond to crime if we don't raise your taxes, but all the
[02:57:14.400 --> 02:57:19.760]  money is going to the bankers. Oakland police chief is making some dire claims about his force
[02:57:19.760 --> 02:57:26.880]  and will not respond to if planned layoffs happened. And he says that many types of crimes
[02:57:26.880 --> 02:57:31.920]  like vehicle collision, grand theft, burglary, identity theft and vandalism, they will not
[02:57:31.920 --> 02:57:36.960]  respond. So the government's going to hold you hostage. And this is how globalism works.
[02:57:37.520 --> 02:57:41.040]  Almost all the taxes will go to the bankers. They'll use that to shut off the economy.
[02:57:41.040 --> 02:57:45.040]  Then they'll say, well, raise taxes or we won't fill the potholes. We won't get emergency vehicles.
[02:57:45.040 --> 02:57:49.600]  The fire department won't respond. This is how you're held hostage. This is the new world order.
[02:57:49.600 --> 02:57:54.720]  This is austerity. This is globalization. This is what they've done all over the world.
[02:57:55.920 --> 02:58:00.480]  Coming up on the streams and info wars.com and of course on the satellites and here on the radio
[02:58:00.480 --> 02:58:07.520]  show, I'm going to cover the economy. And I'm also going to get into the latest police state
