[00:00.000 --> 00:14.380]  Big Brother, mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex
[00:14.380 --> 00:39.280]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. Ladies and
[00:39.280 --> 00:44.360]  gentlemen, I couldn't think of a more important time in world history if you think the planet
[00:44.360 --> 00:50.580]  is in crisis now. If it continues along this line, we have not seen anything yet. You know
[00:50.580 --> 00:57.300]  the song? You ain't seen nothing yet. No, no, no, baby, you ain't seen nothing yet. The
[00:57.300 --> 01:03.300]  future destiny of our species is being decided right now. And our destiny is always being
[01:03.300 --> 01:09.100]  decided to a certain extent, but we're entering a real point of change at every level. And
[01:09.100 --> 01:15.180]  the globalists are in there trying to grab as much power as they can and trying to bend
[01:15.180 --> 01:20.060]  the development of civilization towards their control system, towards their control freak
[01:20.060 --> 01:27.220]  ideology of eugenics and dehumanization. We, those of us that love liberty and decency
[01:27.220 --> 01:33.780]  and beauty and honor and justice and creativity and life, we must get in there and wrestle
[01:33.780 --> 01:41.740]  against these forces that are in love with death. Wow, where to begin and where to start?
[01:41.740 --> 01:49.820]  It is the beginning of the 2012 fifth annual money bomb. And despite the fact that we reached
[01:49.820 --> 01:54.620]  probably, I don't know, close to twice as many people as we were just reaching, say,
[01:54.620 --> 02:03.380]  two years ago or more, less capital comes in per listener. So thank God our listenership
[02:03.380 --> 02:07.940]  was exploded. That's allowed more capital to come in, to continue to sustain ourselves
[02:07.940 --> 02:12.180]  and to continue to be able to develop new ways to get information out to people. The
[02:12.180 --> 02:18.060]  nightly news, the magazine, the films, all the things we've been working on here because
[02:18.060 --> 02:21.500]  we're the best there is. Doesn't mean we're that good either. So I don't think of myself
[02:21.500 --> 02:26.420]  as that great. But I'm doing the best job I can. In fact, I beat myself up for not doing
[02:26.420 --> 02:31.180]  a better job sometimes. And it's important not to be arrogant, arrogance and know it
[02:31.180 --> 02:39.380]  all is the true path to failure and enslavement. So I try to keep it real as they say, but
[02:39.380 --> 02:44.660]  we are the best there is when it comes to fighting the new world order, not compromising,
[02:44.660 --> 02:50.380]  exposing the private fellow reserve, exposing who really runs things. This is it. This radio
[02:50.380 --> 02:55.340]  broadcast, the TV shows, all that we do are international national treasures because of
[02:55.340 --> 03:01.300]  the guests we have on the focal point for you, the listeners. I am the crazy traffic
[03:01.300 --> 03:06.140]  cop. I think many times I'm the weak link to all of this, but you know, the Lord works
[03:06.140 --> 03:11.780]  in mysterious ways, but here we are. And you can go to info wars money bomb.com. It is
[03:11.780 --> 03:18.780]  so important that you donate because they got top economists in the news today saying
[03:18.780 --> 03:23.260]  we're going into a global depression. Well, yeah, the global depression has been going
[03:23.260 --> 03:29.060]  for a long time, but it's designed to be incremental with a big bang at the end. We're
[03:29.060 --> 03:32.380]  going to be going over some of that today. And we've got the next 48 hours, I guess
[03:32.380 --> 03:39.540]  not today, the next two days from now until Saturday at 11am. We even go to noon, you
[03:39.540 --> 03:42.980]  know, people are coming in on Saturday. Why not just maybe do three days? Who knows what
[03:42.980 --> 03:47.220]  will happen? We probably will have some surprise guest. I want to head this morning and started
[03:47.220 --> 03:52.100]  calling some of my celebrity friends. I kind of got around to the last minute, but it looks
[03:52.100 --> 03:56.460]  like some of that's going to come through. Celebrities are interesting if they're into
[03:56.460 --> 03:59.620]  liberty. But frankly, they're not usually even the most popular type guest we have
[03:59.620 --> 04:05.620]  on people like folks that are real and are passionate and know what they're talking about.
[04:05.620 --> 04:12.940]  People like Gerald Solente. People like Bob Chapman rest his soul. People like Max Kaiser.
[04:12.940 --> 04:18.120]  People like myself. Believe it or not, we can get internet ratings and also station ratings
[04:18.120 --> 04:23.380]  and things. And I am the most popular person on the Alex Jones show. I guess that's why
[04:23.380 --> 04:28.340]  it's called the Alex Jones show. I don't know why. I personally like the guest when I'm
[04:28.340 --> 04:33.820]  not interrupting him. So the point is we're going to have just a smorgasbord. The full
[04:33.820 --> 04:41.460]  rundown of who's coming up today and tomorrow is all at info wars money bomb.com. And you

[06:00.740 --> 06:06.660]  Cold and flu season is upon us. Protect yourself with supernatural silver, a revolutionary
[06:06.660 --> 06:12.660]  new broad spectrum antibacterial. Recent advances in silver technology have resulted in a silver
[06:12.660 --> 06:18.780]  solution that can be used daily to prevent bacteria, viruses, mold and food poisoning
[06:18.780 --> 06:23.860]  as well as help improve wound healing. Silver salt technology is safe enough to consume
[06:23.860 --> 06:29.100]  every day while powerful enough to destroy the causes of many serious diseases like strep
[06:29.100 --> 06:35.660]  throat, staph, pneumonia, colds, flus and other harmful pathogens. This new technology is much
[06:35.660 --> 06:41.300]  more effective than colloidal or ionic silvers and has the ability to terminate entire colonies
[06:41.300 --> 06:47.580]  of harmful bacteria at several hundred times the effectiveness of older solutions. Supernatural

[07:19.660 --> 07:24.340]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting
[07:24.340 --> 07:29.420]  your own supply of foods from Eat Foods Direct now. As the price of raw ingredients increases,
[07:29.420 --> 07:33.340]  Eat Foods will have to raise prices too. Now is the time to get your supply. I recently
[07:33.340 --> 07:37.020]  increased my supply from Eat Foods Direct because we have all known this was coming.
[07:37.020 --> 07:41.540]  You know about their delicious long term storeable foods. The fact is you can eat at any time
[07:41.540 --> 07:45.580]  to save money today and because it stores for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices
[07:45.580 --> 07:51.780]  and avoiding the rising food cost. Don't wait. Call 800-409-5633 or go to EatFoodsDirect.com

[08:08.500 --> 08:26.380]  GCN radio network. I'm waiting in my cold cell when the bell begins to chime. Reflecting
[08:26.380 --> 08:40.660]  on my past life and it doesn't have much time. Because at five o'clock they'd take me to
[08:40.660 --> 08:52.460]  the gallows pole. The sands of time for the New World Order. The sands of time for me
[08:52.460 --> 09:10.060]  are running low. Running low. Running low. It is the 18th day of October 2012. I am your
[09:10.060 --> 09:20.140]  host Alex Jones and we're going to be here for the next 48 hours. Yeah! You heard me
[09:20.140 --> 09:29.180]  right and we are excited. We are energized in the animating contest for liberty against
[09:29.180 --> 09:38.700]  the forces of tyranny. It's like a ship without a storm. The night without a dawn. Evil is
[09:38.700 --> 09:45.780]  there to test and challenge the good. And I know this. I am ready for the challenge.
[09:45.780 --> 09:52.260]  For the cost may be we shall go on to the end and we shall never surrender. Thank you
[09:52.260 --> 09:58.180]  for joining us, ladies and gentlemen. We have an incredible 48-hour transmission that will
[09:58.180 --> 10:05.580]  end Saturday at 11am central. I'm doing around what is it, 20 hours of the transmitting.
[10:05.580 --> 10:10.220]  And we've got amazing special guests, surprise guests. You name it, kicks off with, well,
[10:10.220 --> 10:16.500]  there's truly Alex Jones. Our syndicated radio transmission, what goes up for 4 hours a day.
[10:16.500 --> 10:20.500]  I do 3 hours normally live for a while. I did 4 hours but I started doing the nightly
[10:20.500 --> 10:24.220]  news so I went back to 3 hours about a year ago. But a lot of stations still carry the
[10:24.220 --> 10:29.260]  4th hour, which is the first hour we broadcast. That will be live today. So that's 12 noon
[10:29.260 --> 10:35.940]  to 4pm eastern, 11am to 3pm central. Kicked off with Alex Jones and Congressman Walter
[10:35.940 --> 10:41.940]  Jones with some breaking news about treason going on inside the government. U.S. Congressman
[10:41.940 --> 10:47.020]  Walter Jones of North Carolina will be joining us. And then we're going to have Greg Palace,
[10:47.020 --> 10:55.500]  BBC, ABC News reporter, breaking news here today. Of course, TV producer, actor, filmmaker
[10:55.500 --> 11:00.700]  in his own right, a host with Jesse Ventura and Tyrell Ventura of the New Conspiracy Theory
[11:00.700 --> 11:06.060]  that premieres early next month, what the day after the election, November 7th. Sean Stone,
[11:06.060 --> 11:11.260]  a son of Oliver Stone will be joining us. We've got John Rapaport, investigative journalist
[11:11.260 --> 11:20.100]  who popped in on Sunday. He will be back today. And then at 4 o'clock central, Mike Adams
[11:20.100 --> 11:24.940]  is going to guest host for 2 hours to give me a little breather. I'm going to go run
[11:24.940 --> 11:29.020]  actually during that break. I found out I go run instead of taking a nap. I'll have
[11:29.020 --> 11:37.260]  more energy. And then I'll cover news and take calls. Dr. Webster Tarpley joins us. George
[11:37.260 --> 11:41.460]  Norrie will be joining us for 2 hours. It's hard to get George Norrie to come on. He's
[11:41.460 --> 11:45.660]  a busy guy. We really appreciate him. It was usually hard to come on. He agreed to come
[11:45.660 --> 11:52.180]  right on for 2 hours. Very, very nice of him. And speaking of George Norrie, I'm going
[11:52.180 --> 11:59.180]  to be on his show the first hour tonight, coast-to-coast-am.com, second largest radio
[11:59.180 --> 12:04.180]  show in the world. So that's exciting and bottoming on yesterday. And then he's on tomorrow.
[12:04.180 --> 12:08.300]  Again, I'm going into tomorrow here. No, no, no. This is today. George Norrie's on today.
[12:08.300 --> 12:17.380]  Okay. I guess he's on here and then I'm on his show. Anyways, and then we've got a bunch
[12:17.380 --> 12:22.660]  of special reports with Aaron Dykes and Melissa Melton. We've got Jakari Jackson. We've got
[12:22.660 --> 12:27.300]  Dan Badondi. We've got Siri and Girl and what's happening over there. We've got Rob
[12:27.300 --> 12:33.700]  Dew, David Ike, Gerald Salente, Max Kaiser, Joseph Farrah, Amber Lyon, the singing and
[12:33.700 --> 12:39.100]  whistleblower, Larry Pinkney, a real Black Panther exposing what's going on today. John
[12:39.100 --> 12:45.060]  B. Wells, another great coast-to-coast-host. Joel Gilbert, Dreams of My Real Father, Pharmacist
[12:45.060 --> 12:52.380]  Ben Fuchs, David Ortiz. Actually, guys, this printout I have is the old one. Yeah, that's
[12:52.380 --> 12:56.340]  why this is not updated. This doesn't have all of the stuff. It doesn't matter. I can
[12:56.340 --> 13:05.620]  just go to infowarsmoneybomb.com and see the full rundown and information there. I was
[13:05.620 --> 13:14.300]  noticing in my folder I had it. Lord Christopher Moncton, Joel Scalzen, David Knight, so many
[13:14.300 --> 13:18.300]  others, a surprise guest, you name it, a bunch of special reports. We're going to go over
[13:18.300 --> 13:23.300]  some of the older reports, but also premiere some new ones, a full in-depth tour of the
[13:23.300 --> 13:28.380]  offices. And if you're a radio listener, you can go to infowars.com. I'm about to get
[13:28.380 --> 13:32.660]  out of the news here in a moment. Just kicking off the 48-hour broadcast right here. You
[13:32.660 --> 13:39.460]  can go to infowars.com and then link over to infowarsmoneybomb.com. The entire top of
[13:39.460 --> 13:51.700]  infowars.com is a giant link. Two days to wake up the world. Again, infowarsmoneybomb.com
[13:51.700 --> 13:58.300]  up there on the site right now. And why are we doing a 48-hour broadcast? Going back five
[13:58.300 --> 14:09.380]  years ago, I was in a 3,000 square foot office. And I had a couple of crew members in England,
[14:09.380 --> 14:15.740]  a crew member in Louisiana, a crew member in New Mexico, and I don't know, five, six
[14:15.740 --> 14:19.980]  people here. We had about 10 people total. And we were already reaching around 3 million
[14:19.980 --> 14:26.580]  people a week. And I noticed we were breaking national news. We were having a big effect.
[14:26.580 --> 14:30.540]  People were picking up on eugenics and the different things we were introducing to them
[14:30.540 --> 14:34.300]  that had always been there, but the general public wasn't aware of. We were able to more
[14:34.300 --> 14:39.500]  and more set the zeitgeist. I could make films and they would be sent tens of millions
[14:39.500 --> 14:44.700]  of times for free online. I mean, we were really having an effect. And I had supported
[14:44.700 --> 14:52.100]  Ron Paul and he had just been on the show five years ago. It was about a year before
[14:52.100 --> 14:58.420]  the campaign ended, so it was about five years ago. And Ron Paul came on the show and he
[14:58.420 --> 15:03.140]  said, yeah, about half the contributions we've gotten have been from your show. He raised
[15:03.140 --> 15:08.700]  about $15 million. And listeners said, hey, you should have a money bomb and expand your
[15:08.700 --> 15:12.140]  operation. And I was like, you know what, I just want to stay where I'm at. But then
[15:12.140 --> 15:15.780]  I realized that enemies were attacking me and you have to get big or get eaten, big
[15:15.780 --> 15:20.300]  fish eat little fish, and that people wanted me to fail in the power structure and the
[15:20.300 --> 15:26.220]  national media, trolls, so many others that wanted to bring me down. And I said, you know
[15:26.220 --> 15:32.140]  what, I've got a responsibility in history to fully go all the way and try to really
[15:32.140 --> 15:37.340]  change history at a greater level and really try to strike while the iron's hot. There's
[15:37.340 --> 15:45.100]  a quote by William Shakespeare in his play Julius Caesar where he says, there is a tide
[15:45.100 --> 15:50.220]  in the affairs of men when taken at the flood leads on to fortune. Well, I want to fully
[15:50.220 --> 15:55.940]  ride that wave, but my fortune is not money. Money's important to be secure, to be strong,
[15:55.940 --> 16:00.140]  to be able to defend yourself, to be able to help others. It's important. The system
[16:00.140 --> 16:05.300]  always tries to tell liberty lovers not to amass any capital, not to sell a book, not
[16:05.300 --> 16:10.100]  to make a film, not to build anything, because they're scared of the entrepreneurial power.
[16:10.100 --> 16:14.420]  They're scared of people voting with their dollars through free association and building
[16:14.420 --> 16:19.860]  communities and foundations of liberty and true freedom. So they always demonize that.
[16:19.860 --> 16:24.580]  So I'd always stayed small, not wanting to be big, almost thinking it was bad to be big.
[16:24.580 --> 16:29.380]  And I realized that was a mind control system. And the fortune that I was after that I wanted
[16:29.380 --> 16:34.340]  to take at the flood was liberty in my time and in the future and to defeat the eugenicist.
[16:34.340 --> 16:39.340]  In fact, I had been, I just finished in game five, six years ago. That was part of it.
[16:39.340 --> 16:42.500]  And I'd read all these hundreds of quotes. I'd gotten the actual market singer papers
[16:42.500 --> 16:45.460]  from the universities where she said, we're going to pose as liberals. We're going to
[16:45.460 --> 16:49.820]  take over. We're going to break up the family. We're going to create a scientific dictatorship.
[16:49.820 --> 16:53.860]  And I read all these other quotes by globalists and I realized their plan. I was like, wow,
[16:53.860 --> 16:59.940]  I've got two children at the time. Now I have three. I said, I've got a responsibility
[16:59.940 --> 17:05.540]  to commit to life and to go all the way against these people and to just hit them as hard
[17:05.540 --> 17:11.580]  as I can and to work my shelf to death and to fearlessly never stop. To just absolutely
[17:11.580 --> 17:17.900]  throw my shelf 110% against the enemy, to commit to it. I mean, of, you know, our ancestors,
[17:17.900 --> 17:25.220]  my ancestors, uh, you know, could fight and die at Goliad and Alamo and San Jacena to,
[17:25.220 --> 17:30.980]  to create Texas. And if my ancestors could fight in 1776 and your ancestors, if my ancestors
[17:30.980 --> 17:35.900]  could brave the Atlantic, the North Atlantic to come here on the Mayflower, my father and
[17:35.900 --> 17:43.900]  mother's side, the least I can do as, as a original American whose family has always
[17:43.900 --> 17:48.740]  been at the core of resistance to tyranny. I must live up to that destiny now and I
[17:48.740 --> 17:55.860]  must 110% fight the globalist no matter where it leads me. And that is what I've done.
[17:55.860 --> 18:01.260]  And in five years of really trying to go to the next level, we have gone from 3 million
[18:01.260 --> 18:07.820]  people a week to over 15 million and growing. Uh, we are now recognized by major trade publications
[18:07.820 --> 18:14.300]  from talkers to radio ink to time magazine, news week, nightline, New York magazine, Rolling
[18:14.300 --> 18:20.780]  Stone as the biggest alternative media organization in the world. I don't really call drudge alternative
[18:20.780 --> 18:26.060]  media. It's something even entirely outside of mainstream or alternative. It's its own
[18:26.060 --> 18:32.180]  entity, uh, and, and is five, five, four or five times has more reach than, than we do
[18:32.180 --> 18:36.620]  when it comes being able to make people focus in on an important issue. But, but when it
[18:36.620 --> 18:44.060]  comes to radio, everyday TV, internet, everything we're doing, this is it. And I'm not bragging.
[18:44.060 --> 18:49.100]  This is a great responsibility. I, I am horrified by a lot of the things I do and say because
[18:49.100 --> 18:54.060]  I don't deliver it right, but I'm trying my best. My heart's right. And we have a responsibility
[18:54.060 --> 18:59.220]  to go to the next level. And if you feel as we feel as if you know, as we know that we
[18:59.220 --> 19:03.420]  must be all in against this, then do several things, spread the word about this radio show,
[19:03.420 --> 19:08.500]  whether you're listening on AM and FM, global shortwave, satellite XM 166, internet streams
[19:08.500 --> 19:14.460]  at info wars.com, the video streams at prison planet.tv, spread the word today about the
[19:14.460 --> 19:21.140]  48 hour broadcast. It's the exercise of telling people about liberty, resisting the power
[19:21.140 --> 19:27.980]  of the little people. That's us working together for freedom is unstoppable. So go to info
[19:27.980 --> 19:33.660]  wars.moneybomb.com even if you can't give a dollar. And cause we do this once a year.
[19:33.660 --> 19:37.300]  Go there. It was listeners that prodded me into action saying, Hey, you got to do more
[19:37.300 --> 19:42.020]  and you're right. I do need to do more. But we need your help. Spread the word, donate.
[19:42.020 --> 19:48.580]  But even if you can't donate email, Facebook, Twitter, everybody retweet our links to the

[19:54.580 --> 20:00.140]  right now for this 48 hour broadcast. Okay, when we come back, I'm going to get right
[20:00.140 --> 20:04.180]  into the big economic world. The worst drought in 50 years continues. And the first six months
[20:04.180 --> 20:09.540]  of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record. 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought
[20:09.540 --> 20:14.380]  conditions, not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables and wheat are all impacted
[20:14.380 --> 20:18.980]  raising prices. The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business
[20:18.980 --> 20:23.820]  blowing up your food prices. The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost
[20:23.820 --> 20:28.660]  at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods for me foods direct now as the price
[20:28.660 --> 20:32.740]  of raw ingredients increases, eat foods will have to raise prices to now is the time to
[20:32.740 --> 20:37.020]  get your supply. I recently increased my supply for me foods direct because we've all known
[20:37.020 --> 20:41.460]  this was coming. You know about their delicious long term storeable foods. The fact is you
[20:41.460 --> 20:45.700]  can eat at any time to save money today. And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking
[20:45.700 --> 20:51.300]  in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost. Don't wait. Call 800 409 563 or

[21:02.980 --> 21:08.100]  with stress, anxiety or less than perfect health? Hi, this is Pastor Jenny. And as a
[21:08.100 --> 21:14.900]  woman of faith, I spent many years in ministry burdened with anxiety and fear. But in 2010,
[21:14.900 --> 21:22.580]  I met Dr. Carolyn Dean and I took her recommendation to try RNA drops. Within days of taking RNA
[21:22.580 --> 21:28.620]  drops, my anxiety began to lift. My joy was restored. And the peace of mind that I would
[21:28.620 --> 21:34.180]  have once called a miracle has now become normal to me. Discover what RNA drops can

[22:36.900 --> 22:41.140]  at interest, forcing taxes to serve as debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when
[22:41.140 --> 22:44.660]  stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties
[22:44.660 --> 22:48.300]  of the people than a standing army. Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a silver dollar in

[23:04.020 --> 23:10.340]  Box. I want you to know some very important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan
[23:10.340 --> 23:14.460]  requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the
[23:14.460 --> 23:20.020]  president could obtain this world class healer. Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are
[23:20.020 --> 23:24.540]  used around the world to keep people healthy. Now, you can protect yourself and your loved
[23:24.540 --> 23:30.260]  ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond
[23:30.260 --> 23:35.420]  to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell. If you want to stay healthy,
[23:35.420 --> 23:39.700]  now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders
[23:39.700 --> 23:49.700]  that don't belong in your body. Call 1-866-VENUS-FLY or order from Carnivora.com. That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A.com.

[23:58.180 --> 23:59.180]  It's the only one you've got.
[23:59.180 --> 24:24.060]  Don't call my name out your window when I'm leaving. I won't even turn my head. Don't
[24:24.060 --> 24:32.060]  send your kin folks to give me no talking. I'll be gone. I'll be gone, like I said. We
[24:32.060 --> 24:36.700]  are back live, ladies and gentlemen. You would say the same old thing. I am Alex Schoens,
[24:36.700 --> 24:44.860]  your host, and that is our beloved Johnny Cash. Keep your mouth shut till I'm gone.
[24:44.860 --> 24:56.100]  We are kicking off a 48-hour continued live transmission with incredible guests, special
[24:56.100 --> 25:02.380]  guests, guest host from Mike Adams to David Ike. We've got George Norrie joining us, Gerald
[25:02.380 --> 25:09.580]  Zelente, Max Kaiser. The list just goes on and on. Our own Jakari Jackson, Linda West,
[25:09.580 --> 25:14.420]  Darren McBrain, so many. Dan Badani are going to be in here hosting hours of the broadcast
[25:14.420 --> 25:21.780]  as well, but we are in the thick of the main regular radio transmission, simulcasting, free
[25:21.780 --> 25:28.940]  video for everyone at infowarsmoneybomb.com or infowars.com to find the feeds. And again,
[25:28.940 --> 25:34.100]  spread the word now and tell people to spread the word about the 48-hour special transmission
[25:34.100 --> 25:41.020]  where we're covering the future of the geopolitical developments in this country and worldwide
[25:41.020 --> 25:46.900]  where we are covering here on air the continued economic meltdown by design and by exposing
[25:46.900 --> 25:50.300]  the globalists, that gives us hope of backing them off because they won't continue this
[25:50.300 --> 26:00.140]  if they get enough heat on them. And what's happening, of course, in election 2012. Coming
[26:00.140 --> 26:04.820]  up, we have Congressman Walter Jones joining us first at the bottom of the next hour, then
[26:04.820 --> 26:11.020]  BBC reporter, ABC reporter, breaking news here, Greg Palast, Sean Stone, John Rapaport, Mike
[26:11.020 --> 26:16.220]  Adams, Webster Tarpley, George Norrie, James Wesley Rawls, Linda West, Jakari Jackson,
[26:16.220 --> 26:20.700]  Russell Dowd and Dan Badani. And the list just goes on and on. That's not even half
[26:20.700 --> 26:29.140]  the list. Infowarsmoneybomb.com to see the full list. Okay, wow. Let me just start getting
[26:29.140 --> 26:33.220]  into the news right now and I'm going to go ahead and give the number out too for callers.
[26:33.220 --> 26:38.300]  And let's do first-time callers again because we have millions of listeners tuning in in
[26:38.300 --> 26:41.740]  any one hour and so many people don't ever get a chance to get involved on air. So we'll
[26:41.740 --> 26:45.980]  do first-time calls again on any issue you want to raise. I'm going to cover some news.
[26:45.980 --> 26:49.460]  Hopefully you want to comment on some of that, but we don't screen your calls unless we
[26:49.460 --> 26:53.300]  have a special guest on it's for that person and then no one follows the rules and brings
[26:53.300 --> 26:56.940]  up whatever they want. You know, I could have Ron Paul on and somebody calling about gardening
[26:56.940 --> 27:01.260]  or something, but that's kind of the fun of it that it is so unscripted. There are no
[27:01.260 --> 27:06.020]  teleprompters. There are no talking points. I mean, you're here with a maniac Texan who
[27:06.020 --> 27:11.740]  loves freedom and absolutely hates tyranny going wild on the radio and just hammering
[27:11.740 --> 27:16.980]  the globalist up one side and down the other. And that really is the spectacle in the main.
[27:16.980 --> 27:28.420]  Toll free number to join us. 800-259-9231. 800-259-9231. And we will be live here again for the next
[27:28.420 --> 27:36.980]  48 hours. Well, I guess we're 27 minutes into it here. And if you want to see us get the
[27:36.980 --> 27:41.460]  satellite up links and get these file sharing networks with the other media systems worldwide,
[27:41.460 --> 27:45.860]  there's a bunch of them we can subscribe to. And then that's actually how people get vignettes
[27:45.860 --> 27:50.980]  we're going to do. We're going to basically put the nightly news out soon, free to air.
[27:50.980 --> 27:55.900]  Not just on dish network and other systems we're looking at. Similar to what Glenn Beck's
[27:55.900 --> 28:00.620]  done. This has been our plan forever. He just basically beat us to it, which is great. Well,
[28:00.620 --> 28:05.460]  I guess he didn't beat us to it having our own TV system and TV shows and networks online
[28:05.460 --> 28:09.780]  that cover the New World Order. But, you know, getting it out on cable and things on our
[28:09.780 --> 28:16.580]  well actually for about a year now we've been on a British TV. He's been picking a shop
[28:16.580 --> 28:22.340]  and two hours a week on the national cable system. And we've also been getting picked
[28:22.340 --> 28:26.060]  up on quite a few cable systems here in the U.S. But what happens is fans that run those
[28:26.060 --> 28:31.260]  systems they go and download the high def version after the show and then they edit them up
[28:31.260 --> 28:35.580]  and do things with them because it's already free to air. We've got to officially put out
[28:35.580 --> 28:40.300]  those contracts. A lot of stations want contracts are like, okay, shine this contract. We can
[28:40.300 --> 28:45.300]  use your stuff. And I'm so embryonic that I don't even have the lawyers of the time
[28:45.300 --> 28:48.300]  or the money or the energy to go over and make sure it's all done right. But we're
[28:48.300 --> 28:52.420]  getting close to that. That's the next phase. But the problem is we're doing the nightly
[28:52.420 --> 28:57.540]  news every night and the radio show and the films and the promotions and paying the bills
[28:57.540 --> 29:03.060]  and dealing with all the little gremlins and things that any operation deals with. I'm
[29:03.060 --> 29:06.180]  not complaining. It's the great animating contest of liberty. It's just that we've got
[29:06.180 --> 29:11.340]  to like somehow get it all ready, get the new studio finished, get the sets finished,
[29:11.340 --> 29:18.180]  get it all in. We're very close and then get it out. It's like we've got over 70 publishers,
[29:18.180 --> 29:23.820]  all that put out, you know, one group puts out millions of magazines a month in Europe
[29:23.820 --> 29:29.540]  is ready to put out M4's magazine in Europe with their own content inside of it. We've
[29:29.540 --> 29:34.980]  got big publishers in California, in Canada, in Germany, in Australia. I mean, and then
[29:34.980 --> 29:38.900]  I've got to like, okay, well, we're just beta testing it ourselves now. We'll have that
[29:38.900 --> 29:44.620]  for you soon. The point is we're getting ready to blast off, folks. You name it. We're coming
[29:44.620 --> 29:50.580]  out with it. You name it. Okay, but we're just at the launch pad. We're launching. We're
[29:50.580 --> 30:03.780]  on the March. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. If you want

[30:57.180 --> 31:04.900]  Sick of the globalist Eugenesis Control Freaks adding poison to your water and laughing
[31:04.900 --> 31:09.460]  as you get sick and die. Start purifying your water with ProPure. My friends, I've done

[32:00.660 --> 32:05.500]  Turn full in here. As the food police shut down food co-ops, the Amish and small farmers,
[32:05.500 --> 32:09.220]  Americans are losing access not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses but to healthy
[32:09.220 --> 32:13.620]  home crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut, yogurt and kefir. It seems there's
[32:13.620 --> 32:17.980]  a war on life giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria. But frankly I'm not
[32:17.980 --> 32:21.540]  sure what the food police are so afraid of. These remarkable foods have been around since
[32:21.540 --> 32:25.180]  the beginning of history with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages
[32:25.180 --> 32:30.140]  being found across the globe in almost every culture. Even today Japanese eat miso. Africans
[32:30.140 --> 32:34.740]  eat fermented porges. Koreans eat kamichi. And in India, fermented milk is a staple for
[32:34.740 --> 32:35.740]  healthy living.
[32:35.740 --> 32:39.540]  But here's some good news. Self-reliant Americans can now discover the secrets to making these
[32:39.540 --> 32:43.740]  amazing fermented foods legally and privately in their own homes. Since it's still legal
[32:43.740 --> 32:47.260]  to make these foods as long as you can make them yourself. For more information check
[32:47.260 --> 32:52.740]  out fermentationfactor.com. That's fermentationfactor.com. It's easy to create your own powerful
[32:52.740 --> 32:59.740]  fermented foods and you can do it by going to www.fermentationfactor.com. That's www.fermentationfactor.com.
[33:22.740 --> 33:36.820]  Thank you so much for joining us today ladies and gentlemen. We are 30 minutes into the
[33:36.820 --> 33:43.820]  48 hour transmission and if your local AM and FM is carrying the show that's wonderful.
[33:43.820 --> 33:49.140]  Please spread the word about the show. If you're listening on XM on 166 please spread
[33:49.140 --> 33:53.980]  the word. Tell your friends and family and co-workers in your email list and your Facebook
[33:53.980 --> 34:00.340]  and your Twitter. That's how those of us that love liberty defeat the globalist is we go
[34:00.340 --> 34:08.700]  out and we proselytize the message of liberty and the story of freedom up against the globalist
[34:08.700 --> 34:10.740]  and their story of lies.
[34:10.740 --> 34:19.700]  Let's see. We have a narrative of truth. A narrative of personal empowerment and family
[34:19.700 --> 34:24.900]  and wholesomeness. The globalists have their narrative of the nanny state and the control
[34:24.900 --> 34:29.820]  freak system and the stage terror and all of their fear and all of their lies and how
[34:29.820 --> 34:33.780]  NAFTA and GATT were going to be great and how fluoride in the water is great and how
[34:33.780 --> 34:39.980]  vaccines are great and how the Federal Reserve is great. It's all a bunch of lies. Congress
[34:39.980 --> 34:45.620]  has a 9% approval rating. All over the world governments are being exposed. That's why
[34:45.620 --> 34:50.220]  they're trying to come in with tyranny because the old power structure can either totally
[34:50.220 --> 34:54.860]  take over and bring an absolute despotism to stay in power or they can step aside and
[34:54.860 --> 34:57.660]  get out of the way of humanity.
[34:57.660 --> 35:02.780]  They can run on for a long time. They can run on for a long time but sooner or later
[35:02.780 --> 35:08.100]  God's going to cut them down and we cut them down in the info war. We stand up to them,
[35:08.100 --> 35:13.460]  we have confidence and we realize they are all running their own confidence game based
[35:13.460 --> 35:19.500]  in fraud. We have the real confidence of liberty and freedom and standing up for what's right.
[35:19.500 --> 35:23.460]  Let me hit the main news. We're going to be breaking down here in the next three hours
[35:23.460 --> 35:27.780]  on the main radio show and then continuing with all these big guests coming up today.

[35:42.180 --> 35:50.060]  Okay, where to start here, ladies and gentlemen, with all of the incredible news. Look at this
[35:50.060 --> 35:56.140]  economic news. Let me just read to you these headlines. CNBC, Merkel urges tax cuts to boost
[35:56.140 --> 36:02.340]  German economy. But last year she said raise taxes to pay banker bailout money to the
[36:02.340 --> 36:09.540]  megabanks and then blame it on Greece and Ireland and Spain and Portugal. The pigs
[36:09.540 --> 36:19.420]  as they're called. But now they're saying, oh, you overraised them, so you're getting
[36:19.420 --> 36:24.020]  nothing now. So maybe cut them just so the vampire bankers can get something. See, they
[36:24.020 --> 36:29.100]  love raising taxes to crush you. We've gotten this out of Bilderberg group minute meetings
[36:29.100 --> 36:33.780]  from 2007. They want to crush us and make us poor to control us. But if they do it too
[36:33.780 --> 36:39.820]  fast, people noticing it angry and they like prosperity at the same time. It's kind of
[36:39.820 --> 36:44.540]  schizophrenic because they get so much corporate welfare cut off the top, the cream off the
[36:44.540 --> 36:50.700]  top. Chancellor Merkel, but notice it's tax cuts for the elites as usual, said Tuesday
[36:50.700 --> 36:55.660]  German needs to stimulate domestic economic demand and urged opposition parties to stop
[36:55.660 --> 37:01.420]  blocking proposed tax cuts in the upper house of parliament. So what happened is, you know,
[37:01.420 --> 37:05.780]  the vampire sucked too much blood and its victims kind of dying, but it's only got this
[37:05.780 --> 37:10.660]  one little piggy to suck off of. And so it's like, oh my gosh, let's let them have a little
[37:10.660 --> 37:14.380]  bit of their own blood. Let's give them some soup. Oh, here you're sick. Let me get you
[37:14.380 --> 37:19.300]  some soup and maybe a glass of wine and you know, let's let's build your blood up again
[37:19.300 --> 37:24.060]  to make you more healthy because it's so delicious. So there's a bit of a fattening
[37:24.060 --> 37:33.060]  up here of what they're doing here. Continuing grief in Spain in depression, Nobel winner
[37:33.060 --> 37:36.500]  Joseph Stickles, we need to get him back on. He's been on the show many times. Now he
[37:36.500 --> 37:40.340]  says, no, they've been in really a depression for quite some time. Well, yeah, so if we
[37:40.340 --> 37:44.140]  for four years, according to real economic numbers, not the new cooked ones, they give
[37:44.140 --> 37:50.060]  you that, oh, unemployment's historically low. I was driving in my car and was listening
[37:50.060 --> 37:55.940]  to Fox News Radio on the local AM 590, our affiliate, one of our affiliates locally.
[37:55.940 --> 38:00.700]  And they actually were, you know, had statements out of the Federal Reserve, which isn't really
[38:00.700 --> 38:05.420]  the government, the private Federal Reserve about, well, because inflation is so low,
[38:05.420 --> 38:09.820]  that's why the Treasury Department, after two years of not giving you a COLA increase
[38:09.820 --> 38:14.420]  on your social security cost of living, it's going to give you this, you know, tiny little
[38:14.420 --> 38:21.740]  percentage point. Was it 2% or something? They said, because inflation is so incredibly
[38:21.740 --> 38:29.020]  low. I mean, wow, they will, they will tell people anything. I mean, they told people
[38:29.020 --> 38:34.420]  in the debate that Obama day one said it was a terror attack in Benghazi killed the U.S.
[38:34.420 --> 38:37.380]  ambassador, even though for two weeks they were all over the news saying it wasn't a
[38:37.380 --> 38:42.780]  terror attack. He just said in a speech, we'll, we'll stand up against terror, just in general,
[38:42.780 --> 38:48.660]  you know, that line, then going on and saying, you know, we don't know what happened in Benghazi,
[38:48.660 --> 38:54.340]  as his surrogates ran around saying it was not a terror attack. And regardless of what
[38:54.340 --> 38:59.860]  you think about that, whether it's true or not of what really happened there, they said
[38:59.860 --> 39:03.460]  it wasn't a terror attack for two weeks, and then they lied and said it wasn't. I mean,
[39:03.460 --> 39:09.260]  it's just, you know, they think you're idiots, but I'm already digressing here. Greece faces
[39:09.260 --> 39:14.060]  anti-austerity shutdown as EU meets the whole country is basically going on strike as the
[39:14.060 --> 39:19.220]  EU. Well, well, they're shelling again, turning all power that's left in the nation states
[39:19.220 --> 39:24.700]  over to the private banks that run the unelected EU bureaucracy. The EU is unelected. Did you
[39:24.700 --> 39:31.060]  know that? And there's a parliament, but they have no, they have no power. They can vote
[39:31.060 --> 39:36.860]  on recommendations, but the permanent bureaucracy, that's why von Rumpia and Barroso, Herman
[39:36.860 --> 39:42.100]  von Rumpia and Barroso never leave. They were there 10 years ago, they'll be there in 10
[39:42.100 --> 39:45.180]  years. They just, you know, or until they want to step down, it's like, hey, we run
[39:45.180 --> 39:50.580]  things. How's that sound? And they work for the big mega banks, the same ones bragging,
[39:50.580 --> 39:54.380]  they've conquered Europe, and now they're conquering us.
[39:54.380 --> 40:01.660]  All right, continuing here with the economic news. Guardian seriously discussing in-deprint
[40:01.660 --> 40:06.100]  edition London Telegraph. You've got all these big newspapers, even successful ones like
[40:06.100 --> 40:12.020]  the Guardian saying they're, they may in print. That is not a good idea. Both readership being
[40:12.020 --> 40:16.900]  down for mainstream media and internet is what's killing print media. We've gone back
[40:16.900 --> 40:21.100]  into print because when it's almost completely dead, they're going to start putting taxes
[40:21.100 --> 40:25.540]  on paper. They've already called for this carbon taxes at the UN and they want to have
[40:25.540 --> 40:32.020]  it where it's all digital, where they can erase everything. And it's important to have
[40:32.020 --> 40:38.500]  hard copies of things. You watch, this is going to become a bigger and bigger movement.
[40:38.500 --> 40:42.740]  Continuing here. That's why we've launched in fours magazine. You can buy them at bulk
[40:42.740 --> 40:48.900]  at cost at info or shop.com. And by the way, supporting us going into 2013 with the satellite
[40:48.900 --> 40:53.860]  up links, the crew in this depression, when you buy books, videos, subscribe, subscribe
[40:53.860 --> 40:57.860]  to prison planet on TV. That's what funds our operation. So that's a donation right
[40:57.860 --> 41:02.140]  there as well. We just have the money bomb. If you're a new listener, we're not NPR. We're
[41:02.140 --> 41:07.460]  not nonprofit. We do that because they ended up getting taxpayer money and things the government
[41:07.460 --> 41:11.340]  takes from you and then gives to them. We're here saying, Hey, if you want us to really
[41:11.340 --> 41:17.020]  expand like we've done the last four years going into the fifth year, then here's your
[41:17.020 --> 41:21.580]  chance listeners started the money bomb five years ago and I ignored it. They kind of got
[41:21.580 --> 41:27.380]  mad if you remember it said, why aren't you promoting this? And I said, okay, I will.
[41:27.380 --> 41:33.700]  And then boom, you saw what happens. So again, it's kind of become a, Oh, what's the term
[41:33.700 --> 41:38.380]  an institution? It's almost like a, like a holiday. It's like the Superbowl or something.
[41:38.380 --> 41:42.700]  And I said, well, why I'm 24 hours, why not 48? So that's what's happening. You just joined
[41:42.700 --> 41:46.620]  us, learn more at info wars, money bomb dot com and be part of history and donate. But
[41:46.620 --> 41:52.660]  you can also quote donate to the broadcast in yourself by telling people about the show.
[41:52.660 --> 41:57.180]  Again, that's the biggest thing. Get the link to info wars, money bomb dot com and get it
[41:57.180 --> 42:04.020]  out to everyone you know. Let me hit some really important news on the politics front.
[42:04.020 --> 42:07.740]  Got some polls here. They'll hit some military news, some police state news and start going
[42:07.740 --> 42:12.980]  to your calls. The weekly standard reached out to the secret service. That was a good
[42:12.980 --> 42:18.180]  idea instead of George Soros's media matters and think progress coming out and just saying
[42:18.180 --> 42:23.460]  that I basically made it up and was racist when it was in a bunch of other publications.
[42:23.460 --> 42:27.220]  We went and checked the tweets when Thomas soul was talking about it, the economist who's
[42:27.220 --> 42:31.340]  syndicated columnist with creators syndicate, one of the biggest out there. We saw it in
[42:31.340 --> 42:35.740]  Chicago. Now we saw it in a bunch of other newspapers and publications. So we went and
[42:35.740 --> 42:39.460]  looked and said, yeah, there are thousands of people threatening to kill and burn and
[42:39.460 --> 42:46.140]  murder and kill Mitt Romney if he wins. And we got attacked and basically some site called
[42:46.140 --> 42:50.580]  death and taxes that it's basically democratic connected. We've seen they came out and just
[42:50.580 --> 42:55.860]  said I was purely lying and then I was scum of the earth and knew I was lying. So but the
[42:55.860 --> 43:00.380]  weekly standard, they contacted the secret service. They have their response here. They
[43:00.380 --> 43:05.220]  are investigating the people death threading Mitt Romney and somebody should investigate
[43:05.220 --> 43:11.900]  the threats to riot. So there you have it. Secret service aware of threats against Romney.
[43:11.900 --> 43:16.980]  But I mean, don't tell George Soros readers. Well, media matters is run by the White House.
[43:16.980 --> 43:20.540]  That's on record. They have weekly meetings with the White House. The former transition
[43:20.540 --> 43:26.420]  head for Obama is the head of it. And they just say, you know, that we're basically evil
[43:26.420 --> 43:30.380]  and racist. But I mean, you know, I guess the secret services too, because they they
[43:30.380 --> 43:36.020]  say they're investigating Secret Service aware of threats on Romney and says they are investigating.
[43:36.020 --> 43:40.420]  The Secret Service is aware of this and will conduct appropriate follow up if necessary.
[43:40.420 --> 43:45.980]  Brian Leary, a spokesman for the United States Secret Services in an email. Here is the small
[43:45.980 --> 43:52.340]  sampling compiled by twitchy. But twitchy is even political, but I guess they're evil
[43:52.340 --> 43:57.940]  too for daring to show, you know, people saying there if Romney's elected, I'm going to assassinate
[43:57.940 --> 44:03.540]  him sniper style. Well, premeditated how you're going to kill him. That's 20 years in prison
[44:03.540 --> 44:09.180]  right there. Boom. You're convicted. You watch. They're not going to probably get a visit.
[44:09.180 --> 44:13.340]  Somebody needs to assassinate this mofo Romney. That's a little different, but still it's
[44:13.340 --> 44:19.340]  a call for violence. I'm going to murder Romney right now. And they give their names here.
[44:19.340 --> 44:24.820]  If Romney's elected as president, I will personally assassinate him. And then retweeting it. I
[44:24.820 --> 44:29.580]  mean, you know, this is real. And I'm just like, wow, I've had Secret Service here asking
[44:29.580 --> 44:36.780]  me how I feel about Obama for no reason when I've reached him a long life behind bars for
[44:36.780 --> 44:42.260]  fast and furious. I had some of the new graphics people that have been here like three months
[44:42.260 --> 44:45.380]  back. They're going, you really had the FBI come here before. And I'm like, yeah, we think
[44:45.380 --> 44:49.260]  I make that up on air. And they were listening back there. You know, that's another reason
[44:49.260 --> 44:53.700]  I'm upset about this. I mean, I get visits and get asked about Obama. So how do you feel
[44:53.700 --> 44:58.340]  about Obama? What's that poster on the wall? It says Obama deception, you know, a film.
[44:58.340 --> 45:06.780]  It's online. Or in that case, it was coming out in three days, you know, then calling
[45:06.780 --> 45:12.580]  employees. They had like, what was it? Like San Francisco FBI calling random numbers.
[45:12.580 --> 45:15.900]  You're going, hi, this is agent says, this is from the FBI. I mean, check the caller
[45:15.900 --> 45:20.780]  ID. It's FBI. I call back the FBI. Why are you calling? Oh, we're not allowed to say,
[45:20.780 --> 45:26.180]  I just want to know, you know, in the meanwhile, people are saying, I'm going to kill Romney
[45:26.180 --> 45:31.940]  with the sniper rifle. And it's like, oh, big deal, Jones, you racist. Come on. I mean,
[45:31.940 --> 45:36.940]  you're a piece of trash, Jones. We all know you secretly wear Hitler underwear. I mean,
[45:36.940 --> 45:44.940]  come on, buddy. So there you go. I mean, I just don't know what to say anymore. I mean,
[45:44.940 --> 45:49.500]  people are like, well, how dare you defend Romney? I'm not defending Romney. I don't
[45:49.500 --> 45:53.460]  like, you know, over the years getting, I don't know, three or four secret service visits,
[45:53.460 --> 45:59.260]  phone calls on top of it, snooping around. I guess they think they're going to call up
[45:59.260 --> 46:02.140]  and I'm going to just flip out and go, oh, yes, I do want to do something. I mean, come
[46:02.140 --> 46:10.260]  on, man. I'm a syndicated radio host filmmaker. I mean, I've been in major movies as an actor,
[46:10.260 --> 46:13.900]  just because Rick Linkletters a fan and called me up and put me in films with Keanu Reeves
[46:13.900 --> 46:17.980]  and Winona Ryder and Woody Harrelson. And who's the guy that plays Iron Man? I always
[46:17.980 --> 46:22.220]  forget his name. I've met him a bunch of Robert Downey Jr. Always calling Morton Downey Jr.
[46:22.220 --> 46:26.100]  That's why I had to, I mean, I'm not bragging here. It's just like, you know, I'm not going
[46:26.100 --> 46:33.140]  to kill the president and everybody knows that. So don't act like I am while you let people
[46:33.140 --> 46:37.500]  run around by the thousands with their names on real Twitter accounts up there with their
[46:37.500 --> 46:42.020]  families and everything saying they're going to kill people. Pretty amazing, isn't it? Okay,
[46:42.020 --> 46:46.380]  I said I'd go to your calls. Coming up after calls. I haven't even gotten into the big news
[46:46.380 --> 46:53.820]  yet. Former U.S. comptroller says U.S. faces fiscal abyss. We're going to be getting into
[46:53.820 --> 46:59.460]  the weekly job claims drop proves to be short live. Well, it was fake numbers could only
[46:59.460 --> 47:03.580]  fake numbers because they've gone and checked with the companies and their orders and their
[47:03.580 --> 47:08.220]  own databases. They're like, no, we didn't hire more people and no, our sales have dropped.
[47:08.220 --> 47:13.820]  But the government said, I mean, they don't lie to us ever. I mean, why not just say unemployment
[47:13.820 --> 47:21.540]  is at zero? U.S. to get downgraded amid fiscal theater. Pemko says so another downgrade on
[47:21.540 --> 47:26.460]  our way to Weimar Republic on our way to Zimbabwe on our way. I mean, that's where we're going.
[47:26.460 --> 47:32.020]  That's where this train goes. It's its destination. I told you this years ago. Oh, I was a fear
[47:32.020 --> 47:39.900]  porn peddler. No, I wanted to expose the people so they couldn't execute this globalist takeover.
[47:39.900 --> 47:44.420]  Breaking news terrorist attempts to blow up Federal Reserve in New York with 1000 pound
[47:44.420 --> 47:51.860]  car bomb at relieving suicide video, pledging to destroy America. How many hundreds of times
[47:51.860 --> 47:57.500]  has the government gone out and found an extremist nutcase loser and then given them a bomb that
[47:57.500 --> 48:00.900]  they believe is going to blow things up? A lot of times these guys are profiled as low
[48:00.900 --> 48:06.380]  grade morons, barely, barely operable, you know, barely can tie their shoelaces. And
[48:06.380 --> 48:11.380]  then they are led by jihadis who are their quote imams who are really FBI agents. And
[48:11.380 --> 48:15.780]  again, it's come out. That's the case with this, you know, Atari militia just said, well,
[48:15.780 --> 48:20.540]  I guess if the Martin UN troops come in was the exact quote, they try to take our guns.
[48:20.540 --> 48:25.700]  We'll have to fight boom off to jail. Of course, they got out of jail because that wasn't a
[48:25.700 --> 48:29.580]  call for violence. They said if foreign troops come in, we're gonna have to fight. I mean,
[48:29.580 --> 48:34.060]  that's said on the G Gordon, let me set of the ATF comes shoot between the eyes. I'm not
[48:34.060 --> 48:38.700]  saying that. The point is, is that you probably could have got arrested for that. They don't
[48:38.700 --> 48:43.500]  wanna go after big targets. And plus it was hyperbole. Everyone knows that with this guy.
[48:43.500 --> 48:48.940]  I mean, they get these the guys that bomb the World Trade Center in 1993. The FBI cooked
[48:48.940 --> 48:54.420]  the bomb, trained the driver, gave him the detonators and the Ahmad Salam CIA asset from
[48:54.420 --> 48:58.220]  Egypt said, okay, let's bust them. They said, no, let it go forward. And he figured out
[48:58.220 --> 49:02.220]  they were setting him up to be the mastermind. So he recorded them saying, let the bombing
[49:02.220 --> 49:07.220]  go forward and went and give a press conference. It was on CBS news in New York Times. Remember,
[49:07.220 --> 49:12.780]  you look it up. And so they ended up paying a million two to go back to Egypt and shut
[49:12.780 --> 49:17.500]  up and it was swept under the rug. They were gonna set him up. So you don't even know.
[49:17.500 --> 49:22.660]  Again, if you are recruited, they can recruit police, military, you name it. They've been
[49:22.660 --> 49:27.420]  sitting in special forces guys. They've been creating a fake profile to say veterans are
[49:27.420 --> 49:31.100]  terrorists and active duty are terrorists. It's always, you know, Baptist, blonde haired
[49:31.100 --> 49:34.780]  blue eyed guys to the type they shut up. And then some of these guys have said this in
[49:34.780 --> 49:38.620]  court. They've even tried to say, well, I'm not supposed even in court defending themselves.
[49:38.620 --> 49:42.700]  They go, well, I'm under national security and they go to jail, never violating their
[49:42.700 --> 49:47.060]  national security order. And they tell them, all right, we want to put you on this plane
[49:47.060 --> 49:52.140]  on a North Carolina to Texas carrying a pound of plastic explosives as a test. Are you ready
[49:52.140 --> 49:57.020]  to do that soldier to the sergeant? Yes, sir, I'm ready to do that for America. And then
[49:57.020 --> 50:02.260]  they bust you, sends you to jail. I mean, I've seen two or three cases of that in the last
[50:02.260 --> 50:07.580]  year. Don't be part of a drill. This guy may have been a useful idiot, real terrorist
[50:07.580 --> 50:11.740]  who got set up and, you know, push to do it. You know, I mean, they do some real stings
[50:11.740 --> 50:16.940]  like that that are more like entrapment, but it could have just been a completely set up
[50:16.940 --> 50:20.940]  guy. And they'll pick somebody doesn't speak very good English is ignorant. It's usually
[50:20.940 --> 50:26.300]  some professor type or student type who wants to, you know, grovel up to the system. They'll
[50:26.300 --> 50:30.780]  put them on no fly list and say, Hey, be an informant for us. Well, what do I do? Make
[50:30.780 --> 50:35.420]  some videos saying you're going to blow stuff up to bring in other jihadis in New York.
[50:35.420 --> 50:39.620]  You willing to do that? And then I've been saying they might do a false flag on the Federal
[50:39.620 --> 50:45.500]  Reserve to make it the victim. Oh, it's the victim. I've said they may have Patriot grips.
[50:45.500 --> 50:48.860]  Take responsibility for blowing up Federal Reserve buildings so everyone can go. Oh,
[50:48.860 --> 50:56.100]  the poor Federal Reserve, those poor little angel cakes. It's the 48 hour worldwide transmission.

[51:03.540 --> 51:07.040]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks
[51:07.040 --> 51:11.620]  like no one is home. Don't let your home be the next target. Make it look like someone
[51:11.620 --> 51:16.420]  is home watching television with fake TV. Fake TV is a small electronic device that
[51:16.420 --> 51:20.460]  makes the same light as a real television. So from outside, it looks like someone is
[51:20.460 --> 51:25.500]  home watching TV. Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing
[51:25.500 --> 51:30.940]  to burglars. Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, and is highly recommended
[51:30.940 --> 51:35.460]  by numerous police departments. Use it anytime you're away from home. To order your fake
[51:35.460 --> 51:44.020]  TV for only $34.95, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV. Each additional fake TV

[54:27.420 --> 54:32.380]  really get into it and I'll cover it more in the next hour briefly before Congressman
[54:32.380 --> 54:40.980]  Jones joins us in North Carolina. Breaking some big news here. But the Green Party presidential
[54:40.980 --> 54:44.220]  candidate, you know in the past when presidential candidates from other parties show up at the
[54:44.220 --> 54:50.660]  debate they just lead them out. And that's bad enough. What's wrong with them being there?
[54:50.660 --> 54:58.020]  We've got a two-party monopoly. But now you know they arrest her and drag her off. And
[54:58.020 --> 55:02.780]  I see articles here in the U.S. where they taser people having seizures or they in England
[55:02.780 --> 55:08.940]  they tasered a clear old blind man because they thought his walking cane was a samurai
[55:08.940 --> 55:12.900]  sword and they didn't even say freeze. They just came up and tasered him and the cops
[55:12.900 --> 55:18.260]  not getting in trouble doing it. It's this crazy over the top thing where all these cops
[55:18.260 --> 55:23.660]  and bureaucrats are watching drama shows where there's terrorist everywhere and they're going
[55:23.660 --> 55:30.140]  out and simulating it in the real world on people having seizures and old people with
[55:30.140 --> 55:35.540]  a white cane going down the street. You don't know what a blind person is. And people called
[55:35.540 --> 55:40.260]  the cops because they saw the cane and thought it was a weapon. I mean it's the public. It's
[55:40.260 --> 55:46.860]  just absolutely in to knitting about anything and everything. My son's got a birthmark on
[55:46.860 --> 55:49.940]  the side of his head. It's clearly a birthmark. And I can always tell when somebody's a liberal
[55:49.940 --> 55:54.020]  because they're not really liberals. They'll come up at parks, restaurants. I've been fishing
[55:54.020 --> 55:57.700]  before and they don't talk to you. They come and they lean down to your kid and they go,
[55:57.700 --> 56:02.740]  did somebody hurt you? What's wrong with your face? And they'll go, well, it's my birthmark.
[56:02.740 --> 56:07.180]  It's just a little red spot. And they'll go and then they'll act like a weird dog that's
[56:07.180 --> 56:12.140]  been groveling or something. They'll look at you and go, just checking. Didn't mean anything.
[56:12.140 --> 56:21.740]  Hi, how you doing? They're just weird creeps and they're everywhere. They're everywhere.
[56:21.740 --> 56:30.620]  I've told a story of my dog, Helmut, a dumped Labrador retriever. And he loved to dig out
[56:30.620 --> 56:39.020]  under the fence and climb over things. And he dug out, got hit by a car. I happened to
[56:39.020 --> 56:43.700]  notice he'd gone right out in the neighborhood looking for him. Actually saw a car stop that
[56:43.700 --> 56:47.820]  had hit him, knocked him up on the curb. And they wanted to cut his leg off at the vet,
[56:47.820 --> 56:52.060]  but they said his nerve endings may come back partially. Well, it came back, but he had
[56:52.060 --> 56:56.340]  to swing his leg a little bit. And I'm telling you, folks, you take him to a park anywhere.
[56:56.340 --> 57:01.340]  People would come over, ignore you and say, what's in your paw or right in front of you?
[57:01.340 --> 57:06.300]  Did he do something to you? And it actually became like an anthropology thing because
[57:06.300 --> 57:11.180]  I would say, hey, how you doing? I'm right here. The dog doesn't talk. And they're like,
[57:11.180 --> 57:17.460]  oh, why don't you get him to the vet for his hurt paw? And I'd be like, why do you think
[57:17.460 --> 57:21.860]  that if it's my dog and he's having to swing his leg that there isn't some other issue?
[57:21.860 --> 57:26.140]  Well, what's wrong with him? Well, he got hit by a car. Oh, okay. And they start walking
[57:26.140 --> 57:30.660]  away and I'd be like, no, no, no, no, let's not walk away. Why'd you walk over and talk
[57:30.660 --> 57:36.260]  to my dog? It was some mentally ill nanny state thing where you were acting like I was bad
[57:36.260 --> 57:41.580]  and you were good. And it was a way to attack me and act weird. So let's talk about you're
[57:41.580 --> 57:45.900]  a you're a Democrat, aren't you? You're some kind of feminist liberal, aren't you? And they
[57:45.900 --> 57:51.260]  be like, and run off. I mean, these are mentally ill people, folks. That's why they're calling
[57:51.260 --> 57:55.340]  the cops on people everywhere when their kids are in the backyards now, or in the front
[57:55.340 --> 57:59.740]  yards are in a cul-de-sac and they're arresting people for kids in their front yard. I'm talking
[57:59.740 --> 58:05.020]  10 year olds. They're arresting people for cleaning their guns in rural areas on their
[58:05.020 --> 58:09.860]  back porch. They are arresting people that have gun cases in their homes that are legal
[58:09.860 --> 58:15.540]  because the because the carpet cleaner comes to your house and calls the police on you.
[58:15.540 --> 58:20.380]  Or the telephone repair person. I mean, this is a cult of crazy people. Oh my gosh, that
[58:20.380 --> 58:26.660]  old man has a samurai sword. It's a white cane. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm gonna go to your

[1:01:01.500 --> 1:01:06.300]  for calling in. Thank you, Alex. I wanted to just comment. You mentioned earlier how
[1:01:06.300 --> 1:01:12.300]  you may be the weak link in this truth movement. But really, you're the man for the job because
[1:01:12.300 --> 1:01:17.700]  we've got a nation of zombies and you're the one to wake us up with your loud voice. So
[1:01:17.700 --> 1:01:21.700]  don't ever discount what you do. It's very important and you do it. Now I was being self
[1:01:21.700 --> 1:01:24.980]  deprecating because it's important to stay humble. But I mean, you know, my point is
[1:01:24.980 --> 1:01:29.540]  I'm trying the best I can. I know sometimes it's excellent when I do other times it looks
[1:01:29.540 --> 1:01:36.300]  like a bowl in a china shop. But you know, I try my best is my point. And that's what
[1:01:36.300 --> 1:01:38.300]  I was saying.
[1:01:38.300 --> 1:01:42.980]  You know, being a parent who sends a kid to public schools, you receive correspondence
[1:01:42.980 --> 1:01:49.100]  from the county school system. And it's like being on the newsletter from hell. They they
[1:01:49.100 --> 1:01:52.580]  have a, are you familiar with the lockdown drills?
[1:01:52.580 --> 1:01:57.100]  Oh, yeah, those are prisoner training drills. They now do them at malls and businesses and
[1:01:57.100 --> 1:02:01.780]  they're just training you to freeze and be a prisoner. You should do a blog on YouTube.
[1:02:01.780 --> 1:02:06.540]  You can, you know, disguise your face or whatever, but do a blog about the school and what they're
[1:02:06.540 --> 1:02:07.540]  doing.
[1:02:07.540 --> 1:02:11.660]  Everybody needs to just talk about what they don't like that's going on yourselves. And
[1:02:11.660 --> 1:02:16.180]  that amount of chatter will annihilate them. They need our acquiescence. Tell us about
[1:02:16.180 --> 1:02:17.180]  the brainwashing.
[1:02:17.180 --> 1:02:22.020]  Well, I've called the school that's spoken to the principal. She directed me to the
[1:02:22.020 --> 1:02:27.580]  head of security for the county. The guy, you know, you know, I mean, eventually, because
[1:02:27.580 --> 1:02:31.900]  he just, you know, didn't see how this could really, I mean, my son is five years old
[1:02:31.900 --> 1:02:32.900]  out.
[1:02:32.900 --> 1:02:35.700]  No, they come in with SWAT teams. They point guns at them. They scare them. They have mock
[1:02:35.700 --> 1:02:39.540]  shootings. They've not announced to teachers before it's drills. And teachers have had
[1:02:39.540 --> 1:02:44.020]  to go to mental institutions over it and had breakdowns. So have kids. I mean, you know,
[1:02:44.020 --> 1:02:46.020]  I mean, it's incredible what they did.
[1:02:46.020 --> 1:02:49.780]  Well, the letter, the letter said that they turned the lights off and crammed the kids
[1:02:49.780 --> 1:02:54.740]  into corners. I didn't know that they actually have guys come in with machine guns and point
[1:02:54.740 --> 1:02:55.740]  them at the kids.
[1:02:55.740 --> 1:03:00.420]  Yeah, sir, it depends the variant, but it's federal grants. And so there's three or four
[1:03:00.420 --> 1:03:05.140]  different scenarios they do that vary. But they have drills where they come and blow
[1:03:05.140 --> 1:03:10.380]  up vehicles in the parking lot with the light them on fire. And they have flashbangs and
[1:03:10.380 --> 1:03:14.660]  they lead the kids out and have other kids with fake blood all over them and say, we
[1:03:14.660 --> 1:03:18.300]  are Christian militia leaders here to kill you. And they line them up and say, we're
[1:03:18.300 --> 1:03:22.180]  now going to murder you. And they do this to five, six, seven, eight year olds. They
[1:03:22.180 --> 1:03:25.220]  do it with a really young one so they can't explain it to their parents. That's in the
[1:03:25.220 --> 1:03:26.220]  Associated Press.
[1:03:26.220 --> 1:03:31.220]  I know it sounds insane. They've done it in Texas, Michigan, California, Oregon are
[1:03:31.220 --> 1:03:36.740]  just a few. I actually cover it and I think the police state three total enslavement.
[1:03:36.740 --> 1:03:42.620]  Yes, sir. They also have people come in with knives and it's to traumatize the kids. And
[1:03:42.620 --> 1:03:46.820]  they say, it's okay. The good officers are here and the lights come on and the good
[1:03:46.820 --> 1:03:49.180]  officers come and lead away the bad guys.
[1:03:49.180 --> 1:03:55.500]  It amazed me. I said I was on a newsletter. That's because the latest installment is the
[1:03:55.500 --> 1:03:58.860]  drug free America. This has been noticed. If I could just read this really quickly.
[1:03:58.860 --> 1:04:00.940]  They teach them how to use drugs. Go ahead.
[1:04:00.940 --> 1:04:05.340]  Well, so my kid doesn't even know what drugs are. And here he is going to school to learn
[1:04:05.340 --> 1:04:09.860]  all about them. So anyway, here's what it says. The Red Ribbon Campaign. This is as
[1:04:09.860 --> 1:04:13.260]  a parent, I'm getting this in my folder that I'm supposed to, you know, see his homework
[1:04:13.260 --> 1:04:14.260]  in.
[1:04:14.260 --> 1:04:15.260]  For a five year old.
[1:04:15.260 --> 1:04:20.140]  The campaign started when drug traffickers in Mexico City murdered a DEA agent, Kiki
[1:04:20.140 --> 1:04:25.140]  Camaron in 1985. The Violin Act began, you know, and they go on and explaining why they're
[1:04:25.140 --> 1:04:26.140]  doing it.
[1:04:26.140 --> 1:04:31.660]  No, they give you a story to feel sorry for someone. It's propaganda. It's a moral narrative
[1:04:31.660 --> 1:04:36.100]  of why they need to be there. They're there. Even the officers of brainwashing don't know
[1:04:36.100 --> 1:04:41.180]  to create interest in children about drugs. So they will use them. You got to hit them
[1:04:41.180 --> 1:04:45.660]  when they're five to 10. That's why these programs do that. So that they then dream
[1:04:45.660 --> 1:04:50.900]  of, think about drugs. So when they're first approached by the low level dealer, who down
[1:04:50.900 --> 1:04:54.460]  the chain works for big banks, but doesn't know it. So they'll use the drugs. They've
[1:04:54.460 --> 1:04:58.940]  proven it. Sex ed is all of it increases sex increases drugs. Stay there. I want you
[1:04:58.940 --> 1:05:01.860]  to read it.

[1:06:01.100 --> 1:06:05.500]  The worst drought in 50 years continues and the first 6 months of 2012 marks the hottest
[1:06:05.500 --> 1:06:11.020]  half year on record. 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions. Not only corn,
[1:06:11.020 --> 1:06:15.900]  but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising prices. The cost
[1:06:15.900 --> 1:06:20.580]  to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices.
[1:06:20.580 --> 1:06:25.220]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting
[1:06:25.220 --> 1:06:30.260]  your own supply of foods from e-foods direct now. As the price of raw ingredients increases
[1:06:30.260 --> 1:06:34.260]  e-foods will have to raise prices too. Now is the time to get your supply. I recently
[1:06:34.260 --> 1:06:38.060]  increased my supply from e-foods direct because we have all known this was coming. You know

[1:08:13.420 --> 1:08:22.980]  Alex Jones. We are broadcasting worldwide. Thank you for joining us. We've now had one
[1:08:22.980 --> 1:08:28.460]  hour of the 48 hour transmission. See the free video feeds and more of the special 48
[1:08:28.460 --> 1:08:35.140]  hour broadcast that will continue on until Saturday morning at 11am central at infowars.com,
[1:08:35.140 --> 1:08:39.820]  prisonplanet.com or infowarsmoneybomb.com. We have now raised $30 something thousand
[1:08:39.820 --> 1:08:43.700]  dollars in the last hour. I want to thank everyone that has donated, whether it's a
[1:08:43.700 --> 1:08:47.900]  dollar or a thousand dollars. This will allow us because we don't have the benefit of MSNBC
[1:08:47.900 --> 1:08:52.540]  that gets bank or bailout money to fund their operations or most of the other mainstream
[1:08:52.540 --> 1:08:56.580]  media that actually gets government funds. We're funded by you supporting our sponsors,
[1:08:56.580 --> 1:09:02.860]  buying books, videos, infowars.com, t-shirts and this was our fifth annual money bomb
[1:09:02.860 --> 1:09:07.500]  where listeners demanded it five years ago. This is the fifth annual and it's really helped
[1:09:07.500 --> 1:09:11.820]  us. We usually raise about $400,000. I'd like to raise a million dollars this year. Our
[1:09:11.820 --> 1:09:16.220]  audience is giant. I understand we're in a depression but the globalist are engineering
[1:09:16.220 --> 1:09:20.020]  the depression as I covered last hour. We've got to expose them or they're going to carry
[1:09:20.020 --> 1:09:26.420]  out this program of making us poor to control our lives. Voting with our dollars, whether
[1:09:26.420 --> 1:09:31.500]  it's supporting alternative media or liberty organizations or voting with your dollars
[1:09:31.500 --> 1:09:36.340]  buying organic food. The last few decades people purchased organic food more and more
[1:09:36.340 --> 1:09:41.820]  so it's expanded the availability of it by putting money into that market. This is what's
[1:09:41.820 --> 1:09:45.900]  happening here. So if you believe in liberty, spread the word about the show, spread the
[1:09:45.900 --> 1:09:50.780]  word about the special 48 hour transmissions, send people on your email list and Twitter
[1:09:50.780 --> 1:09:56.260]  and Facebook, infowarsmoneybomb.com. We've got so many amazing guests coming up and special
[1:09:56.260 --> 1:10:01.020]  guests and special reports and co-host in here in the next 48 hours, all listed at
[1:10:01.020 --> 1:10:05.820]  infowarsmoneybomb.com. Now I want to get into Iran. Congressman Walter Jones is coming
[1:10:05.820 --> 1:10:10.820]  up to get into that and a lot more but I've got to get to your calls. I said I was, I'm
[1:10:10.820 --> 1:10:15.140]  going to do it. In the last little segment, a father called in and said his son is in
[1:10:15.140 --> 1:10:21.140]  elementary school, Bill in North Carolina and they have safety drills. Now we've actually
[1:10:21.140 --> 1:10:24.540]  made them ratchet some of these back in the last decade because folks, they were going
[1:10:24.540 --> 1:10:31.060]  into schools. I have video of it. I've aired it. It's in police state three total enslavement
[1:10:31.060 --> 1:10:34.140]  where the cops come in and say, we're the militia, we're going to kill you two elementary
[1:10:34.140 --> 1:10:38.100]  students and they cry and wet themselves and they come in with guys with knives or the
[1:10:38.100 --> 1:10:42.220]  lights off and say, we're gun owners. You think I'm joking? That's in the federal
[1:10:42.220 --> 1:10:45.820]  script. AP picking up a few years ago out of Michigan the last time I saw it big in
[1:10:45.820 --> 1:10:50.380]  the news where they blew up, set a car on fire in the parking lot, had the entire elementary
[1:10:50.380 --> 1:10:55.620]  school out and then had guys in camo say, we're going to kill you. We're the militia
[1:10:55.620 --> 1:11:01.220]  of homeschoolers against public education. That's a quote. Go look it up. John Baum is
[1:11:01.220 --> 1:11:06.020]  out there looking in front of a bunch of articles. Look up school drills scare children, school
[1:11:06.020 --> 1:11:11.140]  drills anger parents. You'll see them everywhere. And sometimes they don't even tell the parents
[1:11:11.140 --> 1:11:15.940]  it's going to happen. I mean, schools give kids forced inoculations from Alabama to
[1:11:15.940 --> 1:11:20.740]  California now without parental authorization. It's totally illegal. They give kids abortions
[1:11:20.740 --> 1:11:26.260]  and morning after pills. The government is out of control and is exercising this out
[1:11:26.260 --> 1:11:33.060]  of control power on people. But up until 1940 or so, 35 states sterilized women who made
[1:11:33.060 --> 1:11:39.820]  less than B minuses in public schools, high schools. I made the film in game blueprint
[1:11:39.820 --> 1:11:44.300]  for global enslavement. People woke up to eugenics got mad and reverse those laws and
[1:11:44.300 --> 1:11:50.060]  stopped it. Okay, we can do that again here. We've just got to learn to hate these people
[1:11:50.060 --> 1:11:55.180]  and know who they are and understand it. Okay, and that is hate the globalists that are trying
[1:11:55.180 --> 1:12:00.980]  to engineer this doesn't mean all the minions and people are police lockdown drill at school
[1:12:00.980 --> 1:12:06.660]  anger some anger some that we're still going to do it to your kids. You were saying they're
[1:12:06.660 --> 1:12:09.340]  going to come in and teach your five year old how to use drugs. That's what the studies
[1:12:09.340 --> 1:12:15.020]  show. The government's on record growing the opium in Afghanistan shipping the drugs
[1:12:15.020 --> 1:12:19.420]  in from Mexico. They only arrest low level drug dealers that don't wander their money
[1:12:19.420 --> 1:12:23.500]  through the big mega banks. That's on record. So let's go back to Bill. Finish your point,
[1:12:23.500 --> 1:12:27.620]  Bill. We're going to go to Ronald Johnny, Anthony, Mark and others. So I'll just read
[1:12:27.620 --> 1:12:33.500]  you really quickly what the what the insert on my son's homework folder was. This is the
[1:12:33.500 --> 1:12:36.740]  last line and I'll give you what they've been one day through Friday. It says the mission
[1:12:36.740 --> 1:12:40.940]  of the red ribbon campaign is to present a unified invisible commitment to drug free
[1:12:40.940 --> 1:12:46.580]  America. I mean, that's a pretty lofty goal. I mean, is that impossible? You know, I mean,
[1:12:46.580 --> 1:12:50.660]  it's just over. These are the same schools are under the new freedom initiative written
[1:12:50.660 --> 1:12:56.020]  by Big Pharma that say all children should be put on Ritalin and Prozac because it increases
[1:12:56.020 --> 1:13:01.860]  their their their ability. It's a total fraud. I mean, the bigger the drug war gets, the
[1:13:01.860 --> 1:13:06.100]  more drugs are on the streets because it drives up the price. That's why they made it illegal
[1:13:06.100 --> 1:13:11.340]  so they can make money off of it. Go ahead. Right. So I'll just read you the Monday through
[1:13:11.340 --> 1:13:16.180]  Friday here and take note on Friday and the idiot that wrote this. Monday, each classroom
[1:13:16.180 --> 1:13:21.820]  will recite the Red Ribbon pledge and will sign the pledge and wear red day. So they
[1:13:21.820 --> 1:13:26.340]  wear red shirt and they they have these signatures all along the hallways in the schools of all
[1:13:26.340 --> 1:13:29.180]  these kids, you know, that they're not going to do drugs. Kids who don't even know drugs
[1:13:29.180 --> 1:13:35.180]  are some of them. Next. Next. This is in what first and second grade, sir. In the garden.
[1:13:35.180 --> 1:13:39.420]  Okay, kindergarten because because this is the pattern by the sixth grade, they have federally
[1:13:39.420 --> 1:13:44.780]  funded ATF and FBI local deputies. They're local deputies, but or police, but they're
[1:13:44.780 --> 1:13:50.500]  under FBI curriculum or ATF. It is literally what's in mommy and daddy's medicine cabinet
[1:13:50.500 --> 1:13:54.900]  and do they spank you. So this is the process of taking your kids away from you. You know,
[1:13:54.900 --> 1:13:58.780]  the Department of Defense is in the schools, too. Did you know that?
[1:13:58.780 --> 1:14:03.820]  I would not surprise me to hear that. I know that it's like logical. I mean, because it's
[1:14:03.820 --> 1:14:09.020]  not about physical safety because even look, even if this is a possibility of serving the
[1:14:09.020 --> 1:14:15.340]  schools are reeducation camps. All the studies show death education teaches kids to not commit
[1:14:15.340 --> 1:14:20.700]  suicide. It enters the idea of suicide and they teach him how to commit suicide and then
[1:14:20.700 --> 1:14:25.500]  people go commit suicide. There's that that's even been on 2020 ABC News has admitted that
[1:14:25.500 --> 1:14:31.020]  the drug education increases drug use. The sex education increases sex. Folks, they're
[1:14:31.020 --> 1:14:37.460]  teaching six year olds. You could look this up nationwide under federal agreed curriculum.
[1:14:37.460 --> 1:14:43.900]  Six year olds how to what sex is folks. Folks, kids aren't even thinking about that till
[1:14:43.900 --> 1:14:49.860]  they're 11, 12, 13 years old. They are absolutely destroying your minds. Go ahead. I'm sorry.
[1:14:49.860 --> 1:14:55.020]  Okay, so Tuesday is tie one against. So they were ties Wednesday socket drugs. So they were
[1:14:55.020 --> 1:15:01.140]  mismatched drugs or mismatched crazy socks Thursday drugs and I don't mix day. So we're
[1:15:01.140 --> 1:15:06.020]  mismatched clothing. This is like just really sapping the subconscious. Now kids now here's
[1:15:06.020 --> 1:15:10.460]  what happens on Friday. And now it's over the loudspeaker warden would in the prison
[1:15:10.460 --> 1:15:14.860]  top 10 reasons to stay off drugs. And it says this will be done like the tonight show with
[1:15:14.860 --> 1:15:19.900]  Jay Leno. It's not even Leno who does it top 10. It's Letterman. These people are stupid.
[1:15:19.900 --> 1:15:23.540]  You should stop right there. They're getting this is a reeducation camp program. The schools
[1:15:23.540 --> 1:15:26.940]  are reeducation camps. The globalists say that in their own textbooks. They say the
[1:15:26.940 --> 1:15:30.620]  families of disease. We're going to end it through the schools. The average teacher or
[1:15:30.620 --> 1:15:34.980]  people even implementing this or compartmentalized they don't know the cops don't know. Yeah,
[1:15:34.980 --> 1:15:39.620]  there's BBC sex education for six year olds. That's in England. It's the same thing here.
[1:15:39.620 --> 1:15:44.900]  Same thing on Australia. It's a global standardized system. Sir, if you want to fight it, go to
[1:15:44.900 --> 1:15:50.540]  the PTA and point out the new freedom initiative articles from world net daily and others where
[1:15:50.540 --> 1:15:59.460]  they admit the plan is to put half the kids on prescription grade and Feta means and hallucinogens.
[1:15:59.460 --> 1:16:05.220]  That's what Prozac type drugs are. And so you want kids to take hardcore stuff worse
[1:16:05.220 --> 1:16:09.620]  than most illegal drugs, but you're saying don't get on drugs. Listen, when they put
[1:16:09.620 --> 1:16:14.060]  them on riddle in Prozac in major studies, they are three to seven times putting on which
[1:16:14.060 --> 1:16:18.820]  drug just don't type this in when I say it. The guys do it. They're amazed because I've
[1:16:18.820 --> 1:16:22.820]  seen this a hundred times. That's why everything I talk about you can pull up. You are three
[1:16:22.820 --> 1:16:28.580]  to seven times some studies show higher likely to go seek out illegal drugs. Okay, they are
[1:16:28.580 --> 1:16:34.340]  turning your kids into drug addicts. They ship the drugs in, sir. God bless you. Okay.
[1:16:34.340 --> 1:16:40.780]  It's a fact. Okay. It's a fact. It's been certified by Congress. Again, I gave my uncle
[1:16:40.780 --> 1:16:48.060]  200 copies of the info wars magazine when I was out visiting family at our East Texas
[1:16:48.060 --> 1:16:55.700]  ranch, family ranch a few weeks ago. I gave him the financial collapse issue and the ranchers
[1:16:55.700 --> 1:17:00.740]  and people really liked it. But they said, but Alex Jones is promoting marijuana and
[1:17:00.740 --> 1:17:06.580]  illegal drugs because we have hemp USA.com as the back cover sponsor. And none of this
[1:17:06.580 --> 1:17:14.220]  has any THC in it. It's not D D THC. The most hemp has no THC. This is the legal stuff
[1:17:14.220 --> 1:17:18.420]  that's been proven in so many studies. It makes your head spin to just be a miracle
[1:17:18.420 --> 1:17:23.300]  plant. Heart disease, you name it. It is a gift from God. We're the only country in the
[1:17:23.300 --> 1:17:27.660]  world. We're growing it is illegal. The non THC type. It has to be shipped in from candidates
[1:17:27.660 --> 1:17:33.020]  legal to import it. This is what all the rich people use the fanciest salons have hemp oil
[1:17:33.020 --> 1:17:38.180]  based hair care products now. Okay. And they literally my uncle tried to explain to him
[1:17:38.180 --> 1:17:42.900]  hemp is not marijuana. And they just don't believe it. Okay. That's why this country
[1:17:42.900 --> 1:17:49.180]  is in deep trouble. Okay. Okay. You got guys wearing cowboy hats with ranches who work
[1:17:49.180 --> 1:17:53.900]  hard or good guys, but they're still so brainwashed. They think I'm selling marijuana in the back
[1:17:53.900 --> 1:18:05.780]  of a newspaper. It's beyond Sheriff Roscoe Pico train. I'm sorry. I'm ranting. Let's
[1:18:05.780 --> 1:18:10.620]  go to Ronald. I'm going to shut up here. Ronald, you're on the air. Go ahead. Yes, can you
[1:18:10.620 --> 1:18:18.220]  hear me? Yes, sir. I can. Yeah, I'm going to be able to bathroom. Yeah, I have to. We
[1:18:18.220 --> 1:18:24.940]  have a question. How come the Alex Jones show doesn't go more into the needs of the veterans?
[1:18:24.940 --> 1:18:31.900]  There is more and more veterans out there that are disabled and barely getting by. They're
[1:18:31.900 --> 1:18:39.660]  going ahead in fighting for their pension. And the VA is refusing. Well, sir, when they
[1:18:39.660 --> 1:18:43.180]  devalue the dollar completely, your pension will be worth nothing. Anyways, we don't
[1:18:43.180 --> 1:18:47.140]  stop that. So it's kind of like if we don't stop the house from you may have missed the
[1:18:47.140 --> 1:18:52.100]  show. I don't know how long you've been listening. And I should cover veterans affairs more because
[1:18:52.100 --> 1:18:55.860]  I covered the fact that they steal your death benefits when you die. I cover the fact that
[1:18:55.860 --> 1:19:01.620]  you're breathing DU. I cover the fact that they say you're the number one terror threat
[1:19:01.620 --> 1:19:04.660]  or teaching police. You're the enemy because they know when they take your pensions, you're
[1:19:04.660 --> 1:19:08.980]  going to go completely wild. Some of you. I know some of the veterans I talked to are
[1:19:08.980 --> 1:19:14.860]  pretty angry. So we talk about how the VA is horrible and steals most of the money. So
[1:19:14.860 --> 1:19:19.380]  I don't know what show you're listening to me. How long you been listening? Approximately
[1:19:19.380 --> 1:19:24.540]  five years. And you've never heard me talk about veterans issues for five years. But
[1:19:24.540 --> 1:19:30.900]  the thing is, like with this, there's more and more veterans out there, especially disabled
[1:19:30.900 --> 1:19:35.940]  ones coming back from. And I won't call them wars because the last war we had, I'm going
[1:19:35.940 --> 1:19:39.900]  to give you the floor when we come back about this. What am I supposed to do? By the way,
[1:19:39.900 --> 1:19:43.020]  you know what the top story is? He's going to break some, you know, news here when he
[1:19:43.020 --> 1:19:50.420]  comes back. But we've got Walter Jones, Congressman coming on, who is doing everything he can
[1:19:50.420 --> 1:19:53.980]  to bring the troops home and to make sure that they get the medical care and things
[1:19:53.980 --> 1:19:59.020]  they need. I had him on like a month ago pushing for this. I just, I don't think that's fair
[1:19:59.020 --> 1:20:02.900]  overall. We'll be right back though. I'll let you have your point.

[1:23:01.060 --> 1:23:05.020]  Gold isn't for you. Ted Anderson, president of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier
[1:23:05.020 --> 1:23:09.700]  gold and precious metal investing firms. I get it. You wouldn't buy gold if you believed
[1:23:09.700 --> 1:23:13.700]  that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions
[1:23:13.700 --> 1:23:17.980]  of dollars like bailout candy, that social security would be there for you. That's not
[1:23:17.980 --> 1:23:23.500]  what's happening. You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation,
[1:23:23.500 --> 1:23:27.580]  or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure. If all
[1:23:27.580 --> 1:23:31.740]  looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold. For the realists, there have
[1:23:31.740 --> 1:23:37.300]  never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold. Since 2001, the US dollar index
[1:23:37.300 --> 1:23:43.060]  has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%. Right now, savvy investors are adding gold
[1:23:43.060 --> 1:23:47.220]  to their portfolios. You should, too. Find out what they know. Call us and I'll send

[1:24:07.580 --> 1:24:14.220]  Since World War I, our veterans have been treated like absolute garbage. There were
[1:24:14.220 --> 1:24:20.660]  some problems before that. Our government's been taken over by foreign banks. They hate
[1:24:20.660 --> 1:24:24.380]  the veterans. Of course, they're cheating you in every way they can, while having all
[1:24:24.380 --> 1:24:28.740]  this propaganda on TV about how much they love you. And people don't know how to differentiate
[1:24:28.740 --> 1:24:33.980]  the two things. But I'm not all powerful. I mean, in fact, I'm not very powerful. It's
[1:24:33.980 --> 1:24:37.220]  pretty scary that we're about the biggest and best thing there is out there fighting
[1:24:37.220 --> 1:24:43.620]  the globalist. That's why we've got a responsibility to grow. But I mean, we just, I was planning
[1:24:43.620 --> 1:24:49.540]  to talk about veterans being shafted with the congressman coming up. You know, I could
[1:24:49.540 --> 1:24:53.980]  pay a lot of lip service and say, thank you for your service. Oh, I love you so much.
[1:24:53.980 --> 1:24:57.260]  And not talk about DU. I've been told, don't talk about DU hurting the veterans. Just say
[1:24:57.260 --> 1:25:02.900]  you love them. I love you then. I love you. I mean, it's all just empty. This is a corrupt
[1:25:02.900 --> 1:25:11.260]  empire now. And the whole world's melting down. And I don't know what to say. I mean,
[1:25:11.260 --> 1:25:16.060]  our troops over there fighting next to al-Qaeda against Russians and Syria right now. That's
[1:25:16.060 --> 1:25:22.220]  confirmed in the back of the paper, but it's not even a big news issue. It's sensational.
[1:25:22.220 --> 1:25:27.540]  So Ronald, I mean, tell us what should, what can you say to help the veterans? What do
[1:25:27.540 --> 1:25:28.540]  we do?
[1:25:28.540 --> 1:25:34.540]  Well, the big thing is, like with myself, I have a form of lung cancer called asbestosis.
[1:25:34.540 --> 1:25:35.540]  Oh boy.
[1:25:35.540 --> 1:25:43.740]  I contracted that in the service. And it's kind of military funny in that I will, I
[1:25:43.740 --> 1:25:50.180]  was denied disability for the asbestosis that which is going to kill me. But because I have
[1:25:50.180 --> 1:25:54.900]  permanent earing loss and a spinal injury due to time and special forces, we'll give
[1:25:54.900 --> 1:25:55.900]  it to for that.
[1:25:55.900 --> 1:26:00.260]  Yeah, well, I don't want to admit they poisoned you. Yeah, that's how Steve McQueen, that's
[1:26:00.260 --> 1:26:05.500]  what gave him cancer. He died at 50. Incredible actor. I love Steve McQueen. He died of asbestosis
[1:26:05.500 --> 1:26:06.500]  cancer.
[1:26:06.500 --> 1:26:11.620]  The metastasized as well. I know it's, there's still some equipment that's got asbestos in
[1:26:11.620 --> 1:26:17.100]  it. But folks, if you think asbestos is bad, try DU. Can you imagine with all these veterans
[1:26:17.100 --> 1:26:24.060]  having deformed children? I've heard neocons laugh about Fallujah having 14 fold increase.
[1:26:24.060 --> 1:26:28.180]  That's the British medical journal. Birth effects. Well, our troops have got a four
[1:26:28.180 --> 1:26:33.220]  to five fold increase. Yeah, it's not funny. I think it's sick. I mean, what they're doing
[1:26:33.220 --> 1:26:37.420]  to current troops is going to make what happened to you, bro, look tame.
[1:26:37.420 --> 1:26:44.380]  Actually, asbestos is a lot of people on the company in this asbestos is a very painful,
[1:26:44.380 --> 1:26:50.180]  slow way to die. I'm talking about, I'll get up four and five times a night not being able
[1:26:50.180 --> 1:26:55.060]  to breathe because my lungs fell up. It's fluid. I'm sorry, brother. Veterans that are
[1:26:55.060 --> 1:27:01.420]  served when I serve back in the 80s. They don't realize they got a death sentence because
[1:27:01.420 --> 1:27:07.420]  the majority of the post were built back prior to them removing the asbestos out of buildings.
[1:27:07.420 --> 1:27:11.180]  Some of the firefighters and police that I went to benefits for and tried to raise money
[1:27:11.180 --> 1:27:15.860]  for first responders, you know, even New York Post called them ambulance chasers. I would
[1:27:15.860 --> 1:27:19.260]  be there in the green room when they would have breathing oxygen mask on with cough
[1:27:19.260 --> 1:27:23.420]  up blood and would go out and give a speech. Some of those guys are dead now. I mean, they
[1:27:23.420 --> 1:27:28.900]  were young and they finally admit it was asbestos and deadly dust. I mean, again, they wouldn't
[1:27:28.900 --> 1:27:33.100]  even take care of the firemen police and military. I'm telling you, that's why I'm so angry
[1:27:33.100 --> 1:27:38.660]  about the globalist. The government at the top is run by scum. And I'm sorry, sir, that
[1:27:38.660 --> 1:27:41.740]  they're not giving you, you know, treatment and things for that. I don't know what I'm
[1:27:41.740 --> 1:27:47.180]  supposed to do. I mean, they're shooting little kids up everywhere with deadly vaccines. They're
[1:27:47.180 --> 1:27:50.860]  lying and saying it's the law to take shots. I appreciate your call. I don't know what
[1:27:50.860 --> 1:28:00.140]  comes. That's why I get so angry. We're building a civilization based on lies. Let's talk
[1:28:00.140 --> 1:28:03.900]  to Johnny in New York. Johnny, thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[1:28:03.900 --> 1:28:08.820]  Thank you, Alex, for being able to take my call. God bless you and best of luck and being
[1:28:08.820 --> 1:28:12.180]  able to do this money bomb. I hope that millions come to you.
[1:28:12.180 --> 1:28:17.180]  I would sure do a lot of millions, but we raise a million. It'd be great. I'd be happy
[1:28:17.180 --> 1:28:22.420]  if we raise $500,000. I want to thank everybody that is donating. Go ahead.
[1:28:22.420 --> 1:28:32.180]  I am seeing such a huge outcry among young people. I'm 25 and I use Facebook often. And
[1:28:32.180 --> 1:28:40.220]  I have never seen in an election this tight where two people are so polarizing, especially
[1:28:40.220 --> 1:28:45.660]  with Obama. I have lost so many people talking about all the things that you've educated
[1:28:45.660 --> 1:28:53.060]  your listeners and viewers about. And I'm just wondering from you, how do you see the
[1:28:53.060 --> 1:29:05.140]  young people in the next couple of years trying to adapt to that there is such thing as a
[1:29:05.140 --> 1:29:10.260]  new world order that, yes, we are in an economic crisis because I speak to a lot of liberal
[1:29:10.260 --> 1:29:15.300]  people and a lot of my friends are liberal. And one thing they don't like to do is debate.
[1:29:15.300 --> 1:29:20.060]  And if you talk to them about, let's say you have a conversation saying, oh, well, Obama
[1:29:20.060 --> 1:29:21.060]  has.
[1:29:21.060 --> 1:29:25.300]  I tell you what, this is so important. If you'll hold after Walter Jones leaves, he's
[1:29:25.300 --> 1:29:30.060]  with us just one segment, 18 minute long segment, I'm going to come back to you first. I always
[1:29:30.060 --> 1:29:33.900]  hold call. It's over because I don't want to cut him short. Stay there. I want to hear
[1:29:33.900 --> 1:29:37.700]  how we wake up a liberal. You know, it sounds like I attack Democrats all day. A lot of them
[1:29:37.700 --> 1:29:42.620]  are well-meaning people. They just don't get that the nanny state is not here to help
[1:29:42.620 --> 1:29:47.580]  you. It's here to take your life over. That's why I get very angry with them. But we'll talk
[1:29:47.580 --> 1:29:50.780]  about that. Stay there.
[1:29:50.780 --> 1:30:01.540]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[1:32:04.620 --> 1:32:09.940]  hottest half year on record. 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions. Not only
[1:32:09.940 --> 1:32:15.020]  corn but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[1:32:15.020 --> 1:32:19.060]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your
[1:32:19.060 --> 1:32:24.340]  food prices. The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices
[1:32:24.340 --> 1:32:29.020]  by getting your own supply of foods from Eat Foods Direct now. As the price of raw ingredients
[1:32:29.020 --> 1:32:33.300]  increases, Eat Foods will have to raise prices too. Now is the time to get your supply. I
[1:32:33.300 --> 1:32:37.380]  recently increased my supply from Eat Foods Direct because we've all known this was coming.

[1:33:11.820 --> 1:33:20.780]  24 hour broadcast to 48 hours jam packed with special guests, calls, breaking news, reports.
[1:33:20.780 --> 1:33:25.260]  If you want to see the full roster of amazing special guests and reports that we're going
[1:33:25.260 --> 1:33:33.500]  to be airing as well as guest host, be sure and visit InfowarsMoneyBomb.com. That's right
[1:33:33.500 --> 1:33:37.500]  ladies and gentlemen and we've got Congressman Walter B. Jones joining us here in just a
[1:33:37.500 --> 1:33:44.580]  moment to cover a raft of different issues. He joins us from North Carolina. First thing
[1:33:44.580 --> 1:33:51.260]  I wanted to bring up to the Congressman is ban on Iranian TV channels in Europe. They've
[1:33:51.260 --> 1:33:57.260]  just banned them and knocked them off TV. They've taken them off British TV. They've
[1:33:57.260 --> 1:34:02.940]  got three U.S. aircraft carriers, two already there, one more about to arrive, one week
[1:34:02.940 --> 1:34:09.180]  until U.S. has three aircraft carriers facing Iran. Potential for October surprise is tensions
[1:34:09.180 --> 1:34:15.140]  build. Romney has now gone above Obama in many polls. The big University of Colorado
[1:34:15.140 --> 1:34:21.260]  who's been spot on is predicting that Romney will win the popular vote. And again, whether
[1:34:21.260 --> 1:34:25.700]  you think Romney's a puppet or not or Obama, this could feed into an October surprise.
[1:34:25.700 --> 1:34:31.900]  Even ABC News a few weeks ago said Obama may stage an October surprise and you've got major
[1:34:31.900 --> 1:34:36.740]  saber rattling going on. You've got proxy wars taking place right now in Syria, already
[1:34:36.740 --> 1:34:41.060]  happened in Libya. And Congressman Jones joins us to talk about that and a lot more.
[1:34:41.060 --> 1:34:48.140]  Congressman, I saw an article out today talking about you and Ron Paul not planning to vote
[1:34:48.140 --> 1:34:55.020]  for Mr. Romney, Governor Romney. We're going to be getting into that as well. Also talk
[1:34:55.020 --> 1:35:00.220]  about your fight to try to end these wars and bring our troops on. But what is your
[1:35:00.220 --> 1:35:04.540]  take and what is the sense of the Congress? Because we've never seen them shut off the
[1:35:04.540 --> 1:35:10.340]  Iranian TV state-run media in Europe and England. I see that as one of the final signs they're
[1:35:10.340 --> 1:35:16.940]  getting ready to strike. What information can you give us that's not classified Congressman?
[1:35:16.940 --> 1:35:24.780]  Alex, before we came home for the October campaign, meaning before the November election,
[1:35:24.780 --> 1:35:30.180]  I had met with several different outside groups, meaning outside of Congress, who were concerned
[1:35:30.180 --> 1:35:40.060]  that there was definitely a wag the dog situation developing and that there could be an October
[1:35:40.060 --> 1:35:45.180]  surprise, which you just made reference to, and that could be some type of action taken
[1:35:45.180 --> 1:35:52.380]  against Iran. Now, since I've been home, obviously Congress is not in Washington. I have not
[1:35:52.380 --> 1:35:59.060]  had any classified briefings of anything else, but I know I left Washington in early October
[1:35:59.060 --> 1:36:06.980]  concerned that this country might find itself being supportive of some type of military
[1:36:06.980 --> 1:36:14.060]  action against Iran. Alex, you know I've said this many times on your show that I wish the
[1:36:14.060 --> 1:36:19.100]  American people would start putting pressure on Congress to bring our troops home from
[1:36:19.100 --> 1:36:26.540]  Afghanistan. I have the former commandant. I'm getting back to Iran in just one moment.
[1:36:26.540 --> 1:36:31.940]  The former commandant is a friend of mine. He's been my advisor on Afghanistan for three
[1:36:31.940 --> 1:36:36.540]  years and I've explained that to you listeners. I do not have a military background, so I
[1:36:36.540 --> 1:36:41.460]  went to this general, who I knew when he was the active duty commandant and said, General,
[1:36:41.460 --> 1:36:45.820]  will you advise me on Afghanistan? Because I made a mistake, we had no more business
[1:36:45.820 --> 1:36:54.900]  going into Iraq than I do of trying to fly myself from here to Florida without a plane.
[1:36:54.900 --> 1:37:01.140]  And so he said, yes, now get to the point. On October, excuse me, September the 27th,
[1:37:01.140 --> 1:37:08.140]  I had reason to email him and ask another response from him regarding Afghanistan. And I read
[1:37:08.140 --> 1:37:13.580]  this very quickly to your listeners. At the end of the day, I am more convinced than ever
[1:37:13.580 --> 1:37:19.220]  that we need to get out of Afghanistan. When our friends turn out to be our enemy, it is
[1:37:19.220 --> 1:37:24.340]  time to pull the plug. The idea that troops we have trained and equipped now turn that
[1:37:24.340 --> 1:37:30.180]  training and equipment on us is unconscionable. Whether we leave tomorrow or 1,000 tomorrows
[1:37:30.180 --> 1:37:35.340]  from now, nothing will really change. We are now nothing more than a recruiting post for
[1:37:35.340 --> 1:37:40.900]  every male content in the Middle East. We need to wake up. And I would only tell you,
[1:37:40.900 --> 1:37:46.180]  I was able to arrange for this commandant to speak to Jim Tallent, who is the former
[1:37:46.180 --> 1:37:55.220]  senator from Missouri last week. And Jim Tallent is advisor to the Romney campaign. And I told
[1:37:55.220 --> 1:38:01.460]  Jim that if Mr. Romney would come out next Monday night and say that I'm going to reevaluate
[1:38:01.460 --> 1:38:06.140]  our commitment in Afghanistan, and if at all possible, I would start bringing our troops
[1:38:06.140 --> 1:38:12.980]  home in 2013, I said, Jim, he will get two solid points from the American people. And
[1:38:12.980 --> 1:38:17.140]  I said, if we talk, Jim is very kind, he's a friend. And I said, well, you talked to
[1:38:17.140 --> 1:38:24.060]  this commandant. So I know last week the commandant, retired commandant, spoke to Jim Tallent
[1:38:24.060 --> 1:38:29.460]  for just about an hour. And the commandant called me back and said, Walt, I want you
[1:38:29.460 --> 1:38:34.740]  to know I have an hour of his time. I think he understands, but whether he can get this
[1:38:34.740 --> 1:38:36.140]  to the top, I don't know.
[1:38:36.140 --> 1:38:41.460]  Why do you think when most generals and experts are saying, you know, get out of Afghanistan
[1:38:41.460 --> 1:38:47.500]  the last three or four years, it's been intensifying with Rumbie? Why do you think Obama accelerated
[1:38:47.500 --> 1:38:55.660]  operations there, stirring up the Hornets Nest, not just in Afghanistan, but in Pakistan?
[1:38:55.660 --> 1:39:03.300]  You know, Alex, that is something I don't have any information that I can give you any
[1:39:03.300 --> 1:39:09.780]  answer except the whole thing is we have not, for the last 20 years, had a decent foreign
[1:39:09.780 --> 1:39:15.500]  policy. And everything that we've done on the Bush and Obama, that's why I went to the
[1:39:15.500 --> 1:39:19.300]  federal court. That's why I put in the H-con Resolution 107 that you've had me on your
[1:39:19.300 --> 1:39:25.420]  show a couple months ago, when a president, the Democratic Republican, decides that he
[1:39:25.420 --> 1:39:31.900]  knows best how to remove a dictator who might be an evil man, but he's done nothing to hurt
[1:39:31.900 --> 1:39:37.980]  America. And then they just send the bombs in. That's why we have so much hatred in the
[1:39:37.980 --> 1:39:43.340]  Middle East as it relates to America. And I'm my dear friend, Ron Paul, and I agree
[1:39:43.340 --> 1:39:49.340]  with him totally. Anytime that you start trying to dictate to a culture that has nothing
[1:39:49.340 --> 1:39:55.060]  in connection at all with how we think in America that you're going to create more problems
[1:39:55.060 --> 1:39:57.900]  than solutions.
[1:39:57.900 --> 1:40:03.620]  Shifting gears from Afghanistan and Central Asia more to the Near East and the Middle
[1:40:03.620 --> 1:40:10.740]  East, it's now admitted that NATO in the West is putting al-Qaeda in. The New York Times
[1:40:10.740 --> 1:40:16.860]  admitted two days ago, the main force is al-Qaeda, is being armed. We're talking about surface-to-air
[1:40:16.860 --> 1:40:23.940]  guided missiles being given to them, not just the stuff they got out of Libya. This is the
[1:40:23.940 --> 1:40:29.580]  devil's game is what I would call it. What are you told, I mean, you're at the highest
[1:40:29.580 --> 1:40:34.260]  levels there in Congress. What is the real policy? Because I'm not saying Assad's a great
[1:40:34.260 --> 1:40:39.380]  guy or Qaddafi, but Assad compared to Qaddafi's a good guy and Qaddafi compared to al-Qaeda's
[1:40:39.380 --> 1:40:45.820]  a good guy. There's no debate al-Qaeda's really nasty and bad. I feel like I'm in an alternate
[1:40:45.820 --> 1:40:55.140]  universe here, Congressman Jones, because why is NATO, the UN, our government helping al-Qaeda
[1:40:55.140 --> 1:40:59.940]  wrecks Syria where they're admittedly slaughtering Christians and others?
[1:40:59.940 --> 1:41:06.340]  Alex, whatever planet you own, I'm up there with you. I don't understand it either. I
[1:41:06.340 --> 1:41:11.260]  don't know and please understand, I don't blame the American people. Many people are
[1:41:11.260 --> 1:41:14.180]  in financial problems. We don't know what the more is going to bring. There are a lot
[1:41:14.180 --> 1:41:19.180]  of issues facing the American people. But why in the world the American people are not
[1:41:19.180 --> 1:41:24.100]  putting pressure on Congress? I don't even fault President Obama. I fault the Congress.
[1:41:24.100 --> 1:41:28.900]  Why in the world doesn't the Congress understand that the American people want us out of all
[1:41:28.900 --> 1:41:33.980]  these foreign countries, spend that money right here in America, rebuild our streets,
[1:41:33.980 --> 1:41:39.020]  rebuild our roads, our schools, and take care of people who cannot take care of themselves?
[1:41:39.020 --> 1:41:44.060]  And here we are borrowing money from all around the world to be the big Superman of the world
[1:41:44.060 --> 1:41:46.580]  and it makes no sense.
[1:41:46.580 --> 1:41:50.660]  You're right. And we're going bankrupt. We now have almost 50 million people on food
[1:41:50.660 --> 1:41:59.740]  stamps. Joseph Stickles, Nobel Prize winner, is in CNBC story today and others saying that
[1:41:59.740 --> 1:42:05.300]  Europe isn't a depression. We're going into one. What is the real sense? I mean, obviously
[1:42:05.300 --> 1:42:09.460]  Congress knows we're being fed fake economic numbers. When you're there in the halls of
[1:42:09.460 --> 1:42:15.620]  power, what is the ruling class expecting to happen? Because we're steering towards
[1:42:15.620 --> 1:42:16.620]  disaster here.
[1:42:16.620 --> 1:42:23.700]  Well, Alex, I'm of the firm belief that the critical year for decisions to be made to
[1:42:23.700 --> 1:42:29.460]  save America are going to be 2013. And with the growing debt and deficit of our nation,
[1:42:29.460 --> 1:42:33.820]  if we're not willing to make the tough decisions, then we're going to collapse. It's what's
[1:42:33.820 --> 1:42:34.820]  going to happen.
[1:42:34.820 --> 1:42:35.820]  That's right.
[1:42:35.820 --> 1:42:40.660]  All these special interest groups in and around Washington that feed money to the Republicans
[1:42:40.660 --> 1:42:45.140]  and the Democrats. And I'm part of the problem, but I want you to listen carefully. I'm also
[1:42:45.140 --> 1:42:50.540]  trying to be part of the solution by trying to build bills that would create alternatives
[1:42:50.540 --> 1:42:56.540]  to the way we finance campaigns because the way we finance campaigns, in my opinion, cheat
[1:42:56.540 --> 1:42:57.540]  the people.
[1:42:57.540 --> 1:43:02.140]  Well, how would you change it then, Congressman?
[1:43:02.140 --> 1:43:08.260]  Well, I think the only way you can do it is to create some type of voluntary system,
[1:43:08.260 --> 1:43:16.380]  either a voluntary public financing where the people are not mandated to put money into
[1:43:16.380 --> 1:43:21.820]  an account, but they can voluntarily put money into account, account, have more disclosure.
[1:43:21.820 --> 1:43:27.140]  These third party groups like Citizens United Decision was one of the worst decisions in
[1:43:27.140 --> 1:43:31.380]  my adult lifetime to allow third parties to come in here and spend millions and billions
[1:43:31.380 --> 1:43:32.380]  of dollars.
[1:43:32.380 --> 1:43:37.420]  Well, what about the Communist Chinese? Because I saw it happen even before it was news. Two
[1:43:37.420 --> 1:43:44.500]  years ago, ordering Red Dawn to not come out in 2011 and editing out Communist Chinese
[1:43:44.500 --> 1:43:48.820]  attacking and making it North Korean. I mean, I'm reading where foreign governments, it
[1:43:48.820 --> 1:43:55.420]  now came out, we have whistleblowers on Amber Line from CNN, that foreign Saudi Arabia, Bahrain,
[1:43:55.420 --> 1:44:01.220]  you name it, they're actually secretly funding what's on the news on CNN. Did you know that?
[1:44:01.220 --> 1:44:07.660]  I had not heard that, but Alex, the sad thing is, and you've been here for a long time,
[1:44:07.660 --> 1:44:12.260]  what I mean is as a talk show host and one of the best in the country, you and I both
[1:44:12.260 --> 1:44:17.140]  know that I'm not surprised by anything anymore. I wouldn't have said that to you 10 years
[1:44:17.140 --> 1:44:23.940]  ago, but the things I've seen in the last two or three years in Washington, the lack
[1:44:23.940 --> 1:44:29.940]  of civility among good thinking people and being so anti-each other because we've got
[1:44:29.940 --> 1:44:34.580]  to say the majority, we've got to raise more money than the other group. It's time for
[1:44:34.580 --> 1:44:37.300]  the American people to take back the government.
[1:44:37.300 --> 1:44:45.900]  Wow. What is your take on the debates? I mean, even if we all know Romney is not really a
[1:44:45.900 --> 1:44:51.300]  true conservative or constitutionalist, the fact that they are skewing the debates, giving
[1:44:51.300 --> 1:44:59.020]  Obama more time every time, interrupting constantly, and Candy Crowley lying and saying that Obama
[1:44:59.020 --> 1:45:03.540]  had called it a terror attack. What do you make about this whole election and concerns
[1:45:03.540 --> 1:45:07.020]  that there could be civil unrest either way, no matter who wins?
[1:45:07.020 --> 1:45:13.300]  Well, I think that is a growing possibility. I do want one thing that I am supporting the
[1:45:13.300 --> 1:45:19.140]  entire Republican ticket. The reason what I didn't do, I did not endorse Mr. Romney
[1:45:19.140 --> 1:45:24.500]  because I don't know where he stands on foreign policy, but I am voting for the talk, but
[1:45:24.500 --> 1:45:27.220]  Romney all the way down to our county commissioners.
[1:45:27.220 --> 1:45:31.060]  Okay, so the media kind of misconstrued that you are voting Republican ticket?
[1:45:31.060 --> 1:45:32.460]  Yeah, I'm voting Republican, but...
[1:45:32.460 --> 1:45:35.980]  You're just not going to go cheerleader around for Romney because you don't know who he is?
[1:45:35.980 --> 1:45:42.140]  I don't know. I know more Monday nights than who's advising him, and of course, if he would
[1:45:42.140 --> 1:45:45.620]  follow the former commandant's suggestion, I would probably be out there beating the
[1:45:45.620 --> 1:45:49.100]  drums all over the country for him, but we just have to wait and see.
[1:45:49.100 --> 1:45:52.980]  Sure. Sure. I mean, why doesn't he come out against the Afghan operation? That would
[1:45:52.980 --> 1:45:57.340]  be a really good thing for him to do.
[1:45:57.340 --> 1:46:01.780]  Alex, I don't know. This is what... I don't know if it's the neocons who were the big
[1:46:01.780 --> 1:46:08.140]  advisors to Bush to get us into an unnecessary war. I don't know... I don't know the inside
[1:46:08.140 --> 1:46:13.460]  people we're from. I tried to find the foreign policy type because I kept telling them I've
[1:46:13.460 --> 1:46:18.100]  got a way to help him win the election by getting the truth. If he doesn't do anything
[1:46:18.100 --> 1:46:24.220]  else, Alex, but say I am willing to look at the possibility of bringing our troops home
[1:46:24.220 --> 1:46:28.380]  when you have the people you're training, that's what the commandant said, the people
[1:46:28.380 --> 1:46:32.740]  you're training turn the guns on you, use their teachers, and you shoot and kill them.
[1:46:32.740 --> 1:46:37.020]  We've had three Marines from Morsock, which is in my district, Camp Lejeune. They were
[1:46:37.020 --> 1:46:41.140]  killed two months ago by the people they were training. We had a young African-American
[1:46:41.140 --> 1:46:46.180]  kid from right here where my district officer is in Greenville, North Carolina. He and two
[1:46:46.180 --> 1:46:50.100]  of his army buddies were shot and killed by the people they were training. I went to the
[1:46:50.100 --> 1:46:52.380]  wake of this young man.
[1:46:52.380 --> 1:46:57.660]  Unbelievable. And it's certainly deteriorating fast. I don't... I mean, it may become a point
[1:46:57.660 --> 1:47:01.620]  where the troops are hanging off the helicopter skids like the fall of Saigon. That's what
[1:47:01.620 --> 1:47:06.900]  a lot of top brass are saying. If these politicians who just want to control the goodies coming
[1:47:06.900 --> 1:47:11.660]  out of the country make no mistake, that's why they're keeping them there. Expanding
[1:47:11.660 --> 1:47:16.980]  on that, what did you make, sir, of Obama? This was the clearest thing we'd seen where
[1:47:16.980 --> 1:47:23.020]  he admitted he wants to ban semi-autos. And he went on to say that means handguns, too.
[1:47:23.020 --> 1:47:28.860]  And he wants to just say people have mental illness extrajudicially, violating, you know,
[1:47:28.860 --> 1:47:35.820]  the 68 Gun Control Act. I mean, that was very clear there. And the NRA says that they've
[1:47:35.820 --> 1:47:40.340]  talked to his advisors and that if Obama is elected, he's planning to sign an executive
[1:47:40.340 --> 1:47:43.700]  order to restrict the Second Amendment. I mean, that would cause a civil war.
[1:47:43.700 --> 1:47:51.380]  Well, there's no question about it. And that, again, is why I am very concerned about any
[1:47:51.380 --> 1:47:57.020]  president and why I supported Ron Paul. Ron Paul believes that the Constitution is like
[1:47:57.020 --> 1:48:01.140]  the Bible. You believe what's said in the Constitution and you believe what's said in
[1:48:01.140 --> 1:48:08.140]  the Bible. And the Second Amendment right is sacred. And it needs... No, that would be
[1:48:08.140 --> 1:48:11.580]  a major fight they have, maybe in the streets. I hope not in the streets. I'll make that
[1:48:11.580 --> 1:48:14.860]  clear. But a major fight in Congress, if that should happen.
[1:48:14.860 --> 1:48:20.940]  Well, they've done these breakdowns, different think tanks have. And that's why they haven't
[1:48:20.940 --> 1:48:26.980]  tried to totally ban guns yet, because they know when they try it, it is going to be very,
[1:48:26.980 --> 1:48:31.620]  very dangerous situation. And the thing is, handgun control incorporated and others have
[1:48:31.620 --> 1:48:36.780]  said Obama has promised them that he will get the guns, quote, under the radar in the
[1:48:36.780 --> 1:48:42.140]  second term. So that's a declaration of war against the Republic. If it isn't bad enough
[1:48:42.140 --> 1:48:45.900]  and I know you've got the bill in there to start the impeachment, if it continues, God
[1:48:45.900 --> 1:48:50.460]  bless you and the media, of course, didn't give it any attention, to say our military's
[1:48:50.460 --> 1:48:56.540]  under NATO. Now, Congressman Jones, when I read in the newspaper about dead U.S. troops,
[1:48:56.540 --> 1:48:59.460]  have you noticed most of the time it says NATO troops?
[1:48:59.460 --> 1:49:06.740]  Yeah. And when it does, I realize that it's probably 99% of the time it's an American
[1:49:06.740 --> 1:49:13.740]  who was killed. Because Alex, you and I both know that the other countries are slowly pulling
[1:49:13.740 --> 1:49:19.220]  the troops out. And it's our young men and women that are walking the village roads and
[1:49:19.220 --> 1:49:26.340]  getting shot and blown up. And where is the American outrage? There was a lady that wrote,
[1:49:26.340 --> 1:49:31.580]  there was an article written when the 2000th American was killed. Her son, Alex very quickly
[1:49:31.580 --> 1:49:36.420]  was a Eagle Scout, graduate of Annapolis. He was a young Marine officer. He was killed
[1:49:36.420 --> 1:49:41.180]  several months ago. And in the subtitle of this article about this lady, Ms. Freeman
[1:49:41.180 --> 1:49:46.620]  is her name, Lisa Freeman is her son who was killed. She says, where is the outrage from
[1:49:46.620 --> 1:49:51.300]  the American people? Why are they willing to see young men and women die? Why are they
[1:49:51.300 --> 1:49:54.860]  willing to borrow money to pay a crook to stay in power?
[1:49:54.860 --> 1:49:59.140]  That's another question. Why are the main European NATO and British troops, why do they stay
[1:49:59.140 --> 1:50:03.820]  in the bases and why is it almost always US troops that go out and do the fighting?
[1:50:03.820 --> 1:50:08.700]  Since when do these countries not fight? I mean, if they're going to be in a war?
[1:50:08.700 --> 1:50:17.220]  Well, Alex, I can't speak about other countries, but I'll say this, that if they're smart enough
[1:50:17.220 --> 1:50:22.340]  to see that they don't need to send their young men and women to die, why are we so stupid
[1:50:22.340 --> 1:50:23.340]  that we do it?
[1:50:23.340 --> 1:50:28.620]  I agree. That's well said. No, it's folks. We're over there to sit on top of the OPM.
[1:50:28.620 --> 1:50:33.860]  Let's not let anybody lie about that. It was what? 9% of world production pre-2001.
[1:50:33.860 --> 1:50:38.420]  Now it's 93% of world production. And that's what it's all about. It's about sitting on
[1:50:38.420 --> 1:50:40.540]  top of all that smack.
[1:50:40.540 --> 1:50:43.660]  Congressman Jones, do one more segment with us. I also want to give out your website.
[1:50:43.660 --> 1:50:47.220]  You've got some important press releases. I want to cover some other topics we haven't
[1:50:47.220 --> 1:50:52.300]  gotten into yet with you. Final segment with the Congressman that I promise. I'm getting
[1:50:52.300 --> 1:50:56.740]  to Johnny. I'm getting to Chris, Evan, Anthony, Mark. In fact, Anthony's next after Johnny.
[1:50:56.740 --> 1:51:01.660]  When we go to your calls, stay with us. I'm Alex Jones, 48-hour broadcast in Full Worse.
[1:51:01.660 --> 1:51:06.100]  The worst drought in 50 years continues. And the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest
[1:51:06.100 --> 1:51:11.540]  half year on record. 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions. Not only corn,
[1:51:11.540 --> 1:51:16.220]  but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices. The
[1:51:16.220 --> 1:51:20.180]  cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your
[1:51:20.180 --> 1:51:25.500]  food prices. The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices
[1:51:25.500 --> 1:51:30.300]  by getting your own supply of foods from Eat Foods Direct now. As the price of raw ingredients
[1:51:30.300 --> 1:51:34.460]  increases, Eat Foods will have to raise prices too. Now is the time to get your supply. I
[1:51:34.460 --> 1:51:38.500]  recently increased my supply from Eat Foods Direct because we've all known this was coming.

[1:53:02.100 --> 1:53:05.980]  Imagine waking one morning only to find your family shivering in the dark because you couldn't
[1:53:05.980 --> 1:53:10.500]  afford to pay your electric bill. That's closer than you think. You probably haven't
[1:53:10.500 --> 1:53:14.180]  heard about this yet because the liberal media has been suppressing what has fast begun
[1:53:14.180 --> 1:53:20.500]  in the most shocking news story of 2012. Obama's secret war on coal that could increase your
[1:53:20.500 --> 1:53:26.420]  already high power bill as much as 400% in coming months. As shocking as it sounds, it
[1:53:26.420 --> 1:53:31.180]  may well be just a matter of time before the lights start going out across America.
[1:53:31.180 --> 1:53:37.060]  But here's some good news. There's an underground video at Exposed123.com that thousands of
[1:53:37.060 --> 1:53:42.420]  smart patriots have used to end their slavery to the corrupt electricity monopoly. The video
[1:53:42.420 --> 1:53:48.060]  at Exposed123.com has already been banned by Google and the liberal media is doing everything
[1:53:48.060 --> 1:53:54.260]  in its power to take it down and keep America in the dark. So watch it now at Exposed123.com
[1:53:54.260 --> 1:54:09.060]  before it's too late. Again, that's Exposed123.com.
[1:54:09.060 --> 1:54:38.820]  Alex, I said that any
[1:54:38.820 --> 1:54:44.500]  nation that was founded on Judeo-Christian values, and that's the foundation of America,
[1:54:44.500 --> 1:54:50.140]  any nation that forgets the words in the Bible and the words in the Constitution will fail.
[1:54:50.140 --> 1:54:55.260]  If you do not revere and respect the Bible in the Constitution, whatever you believe
[1:54:55.260 --> 1:54:57.100]  will fail.
[1:54:57.100 --> 1:55:07.580]  Well, I mean, I look at the fact in America that our military chaplains who have the Christian
[1:55:07.580 --> 1:55:13.860]  faith have been instructed since 1990 that if they are outside the church on base, they
[1:55:13.860 --> 1:55:17.940]  should not close a prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. I've been working on that thing for
[1:55:17.940 --> 1:55:24.460]  10 years, truthfully. I look at the fact that presidents will not even come to Congress.
[1:55:24.460 --> 1:55:28.860]  They would rather just have the authority to bomb another country because they don't
[1:55:28.860 --> 1:55:35.020]  like the dictators. That goes from the Bible, a chaplain to a president that does not revere
[1:55:35.020 --> 1:55:41.860]  or respect the Constitution. I said to the Romney people, if he would make this statement
[1:55:41.860 --> 1:55:46.700]  in one of the debates that if I become the President of the United States, I admit Romney
[1:55:46.700 --> 1:55:52.740]  will promise you I will follow the Constitution because I swear to uphold the Constitution,
[1:55:52.740 --> 1:55:58.620]  I will follow the Constitution. Alex, that's just like Afghanistan. He would get, Ron
[1:55:58.620 --> 1:56:03.740]  Paul's people, people like you and me, we would go wild to hear some president say that.
[1:56:03.740 --> 1:56:08.180]  They don't even say that anymore.
[1:56:08.180 --> 1:56:13.580]  On the point of collapse, is there any way to avert the economic collapse that we're
[1:56:13.580 --> 1:56:19.220]  going into and what will the decadent mobs of people do if the collapse gets really
[1:56:19.220 --> 1:56:26.700]  serious? Well, I'm not optimistic at this point
[1:56:26.700 --> 1:56:35.500]  that we can install a collapse. I hope that I'm wrong. I hope that you're wrong. But when
[1:56:35.500 --> 1:56:42.580]  you have a country that has to borrow money from the Chinese, the Japanese to pay the
[1:56:42.580 --> 1:56:48.580]  debts of a nation, and when you're paying $1 billion a day just to pay the interest on
[1:56:48.580 --> 1:56:53.660]  the debt, it can't keep going on.
[1:56:53.660 --> 1:56:58.460]  I think the corrupt in government know that. That's why they're digging in by 1.6 billion
[1:56:58.460 --> 1:57:03.700]  bullets now and putting troops on the streets in different parts of the country. The system
[1:57:03.700 --> 1:57:08.100]  knows and they think they're going to just, I guess, take over during the collapse, Congressman.
[1:57:08.100 --> 1:57:10.860]  Your take on all the massive bullet purchases.
[1:57:10.860 --> 1:57:18.780]  I, like any God-fearing person and a man who believes that we, the American people who
[1:57:18.780 --> 1:57:24.380]  are law-abiding citizens, have every right to our freedoms, I'm concerned about it.
[1:57:24.380 --> 1:57:30.780]  We've only got about a minute left, Congressman. Any other points you'd like to add?
[1:57:30.780 --> 1:57:34.860]  I really would like to ask your listeners to please pick up the phones and call the
[1:57:34.860 --> 1:57:39.580]  members of Congress. Everyone of them is home during this three weeks before the election
[1:57:39.580 --> 1:57:44.860]  and tell them to, for God's sake, bring the kids home before 2014. That's Obama's date,
[1:57:44.860 --> 1:57:49.940]  December 2014. How many more have to die? Lose their legs, lose their arms? It's just
[1:57:49.940 --> 1:57:51.260]  not fair to them.
[1:57:51.260 --> 1:57:54.660]  Well, they've already had other pull-out dates. They're probably just going to move
[1:57:54.660 --> 1:57:55.980]  it down the road again.
[1:57:55.980 --> 1:58:03.140]  Well, that's one of the concerns of a few Republicans and a few Democrats is that 2014
[1:58:03.140 --> 1:58:08.660]  can become 2015. And before you know it, you're talking about 2016. And it can happen that
[1:58:08.660 --> 1:58:14.100]  way, Alex, you're exactly right. It can happen. If the American people do not let their voices
[1:58:14.100 --> 1:58:15.100]  be heard.
[1:58:15.100 --> 1:58:19.700]  Absolutely, folks. People are always asking me, Alex, do something. Folks, you got the
[1:58:19.700 --> 1:58:24.420]  power. You've got all the power. Congressman will let you go and please come back on soon
[1:58:24.420 --> 1:58:28.860]  to talk about your bill to allow citizens on U.S. beaches they're closing as part of
[1:58:28.860 --> 1:58:32.460]  their U.N. garbage. There's so much we didn't get into. It's all at jones.house.gov.
[1:58:32.460 --> 1:58:35.980]  Alex, let's talk after the election and see where we're going.
[1:58:35.980 --> 1:58:42.180]  Yes, sir. Thank you so much. We'll be right back, folks.
[1:58:42.180 --> 1:58:51.540]  You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:51.540 --> 1:58:56.380]  Aaron Fullen here. As the food police shut down food co-ops, the Amish and small farmers,
[1:58:56.380 --> 1:59:00.140]  Americans are losing access, not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses, but to healthy
[1:59:00.140 --> 1:59:04.540]  home-crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut, yogurt, and kefir. It seems there's
[1:59:04.540 --> 1:59:08.900]  a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria. But frankly, I'm not
[1:59:08.900 --> 1:59:12.460]  sure what the food police are so afraid of. These remarkable foods have been around since
[1:59:12.460 --> 1:59:16.060]  the beginning of history, with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages
[1:59:16.060 --> 1:59:21.060]  being found across the globe in almost every culture. Even today, Japanese eat miso, Africans
[1:59:21.060 --> 1:59:25.620]  eat fermented porges, Koreans eat kamichi, and in India, fermented milk is a staple for
[1:59:25.620 --> 1:59:26.620]  healthy living.
[1:59:26.620 --> 1:59:30.420]  But here's some good news. Self-reliant Americans can now discover the secrets to making these
[1:59:30.420 --> 1:59:34.620]  amazing fermented foods legally and privately in their own homes, since it's still legal
[1:59:34.620 --> 1:59:38.140]  to make these foods as long as you can make them yourself. For more information, check

[2:00:15.060 --> 2:00:33.060]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. Wow, we're
[2:00:33.060 --> 2:00:39.380]  already two hours into the 48-hour marathon transmission. See the full list and breakdown
[2:00:39.380 --> 2:00:43.940]  in FullWarsMoneyBomb.com. I haven't checked a little while on the donations coming in.
[2:00:43.940 --> 2:00:49.300]  We'll be talking more about that. Quite frankly, we do these MoneyBomb 24-hour, 48-hour transmissions
[2:00:49.300 --> 2:00:52.860]  once a year. This is our first 48-hour, and I don't even sit there and hype it enough.
[2:00:52.860 --> 2:00:56.980]  I don't think they've updated. It doesn't update in real time. It's been $34,000 for
[2:00:56.980 --> 2:01:01.020]  about an hour. It's important. I can tell the guys, you know, update that as fast as
[2:01:01.020 --> 2:01:05.700]  they can, because we need to show people what's happening. The free video feed is all there
[2:01:05.700 --> 2:01:10.980]  as well. Let's go back to Johnny. And I promise I'll move quick through calls now. Anthony
[2:01:10.980 --> 2:01:15.260]  and Mark and others that have been holding for any on. You were making the point earlier
[2:01:15.260 --> 2:01:18.540]  we had to hold you over for those that just joined us. We'll just recap what you were
[2:01:18.540 --> 2:01:20.460]  saying and then get to your question.
[2:01:20.460 --> 2:01:29.540]  I mean, yeah, Alex, it's just a lot of young people. I'm 25, like I said, who are for some
[2:01:29.540 --> 2:01:34.100]  reason, especially in the last couple of years, they don't want to hear anything bad about
[2:01:34.100 --> 2:01:42.380]  Obama. It's God forbid you say anything about Obama. It's like they're literally shooting
[2:01:42.380 --> 2:01:47.060]  you. Like it's very, very, very bad stuff. And then when you pick a conversation with
[2:01:47.060 --> 2:01:53.700]  them, especially the liberals, they'll be, if you mentioned, oh, Obama had a, he raised
[2:01:53.700 --> 2:01:59.420]  it debt ceiling by $6 trillion. And then they'll say, well, this conversation's over, but
[2:01:59.420 --> 2:02:03.500]  we're having a conversation about how he raised that they think you're then totally loving
[2:02:03.500 --> 2:02:07.100]  Romney and all his corruption. See, that's what the left-right paradigm is. It doesn't
[2:02:07.100 --> 2:02:10.620]  mean there's not real debates between the two sides. So there's not a real fight going
[2:02:10.620 --> 2:02:16.140]  on over the power structure, but it limits it. That's what the paradigm is, is that,
[2:02:16.140 --> 2:02:21.180]  well, you're a Republican, so a Democrat can't listen to you, or you're a Democrat, so Republican
[2:02:21.180 --> 2:02:24.980]  can't listen to you. And both sides, you know, to grassroots say some things that make sense
[2:02:24.980 --> 2:02:30.100]  sometimes, but then it's a false choice because they're bought and paid for by the same people.
[2:02:30.100 --> 2:02:35.220]  So then it's just rhetoric. But yeah, Democrats and Republicans, to a great extent, will not
[2:02:35.220 --> 2:02:43.540]  listen to the other side because they are so locked into like their gang. And Republicans
[2:02:43.540 --> 2:02:48.260]  are bad, but I'll tell you, Democrats, it is cult-like, and they get this little grin
[2:02:48.260 --> 2:02:54.700]  on their face. They laugh at you because they're like children. Their identity is that they
[2:02:54.700 --> 2:03:01.380]  are a Democrat. Their identity is their winning. Their identity is it's their sports team.
[2:03:01.380 --> 2:03:04.140]  And it's like trying to tell two sports fans who are sitting there going, yeah, did you
[2:03:04.140 --> 2:03:07.900]  see that game? Yeah, did you see that call? Yo, you're like, hey, guys, there's more
[2:03:07.900 --> 2:03:12.620]  important things in the world. They look at you like you're crazy. So they think you're
[2:03:12.620 --> 2:03:20.460]  trying to dumb them down. They think you're trying to say they're wrong. And, you know,
[2:03:20.460 --> 2:03:23.940]  sometimes you just got to move on to people that care because it's never been a majority
[2:03:23.940 --> 2:03:29.020]  that changes things. There's an evil minority and an evil, you know, group that wants control
[2:03:29.020 --> 2:03:32.740]  and then there's good groups. And the problem is, good's not normally organized. There's
[2:03:32.740 --> 2:03:37.700]  always more good guys that are actually, you know, willing to take action, but we're all
[2:03:37.700 --> 2:03:42.020]  basically, you know, taught from Burt that we don't have any power. So we kind of stand
[2:03:42.020 --> 2:03:46.380]  down and then we don't get organized. Or if we do get organized, they try to infiltrate
[2:03:46.380 --> 2:03:52.100]  us or they cause infighting. So, I mean, it's a complex issue, but you're out in California
[2:03:52.100 --> 2:03:57.140]  and, you know, they've got a narrative, especially out there. I mean, look at California. It's
[2:03:57.140 --> 2:04:03.500]  a beautiful state, a lot of resources, it's falling apart because of corruption and in
[2:04:03.500 --> 2:04:07.660]  big government. And no matter how nice the state is, you know, there's an exodus out
[2:04:07.660 --> 2:04:13.180]  of it now. So they'll just have to, you know, they'll have to grow up and actually, you
[2:04:13.180 --> 2:04:15.700]  know, find out how things really work.
[2:04:15.700 --> 2:04:19.900]  People got to understand, Alex, that there is, and I, this is how I look at government
[2:04:19.900 --> 2:04:25.420]  ever since I've woken up, there are seven pillars of new or older governance. You have
[2:04:25.420 --> 2:04:30.500]  the general population in the bottom, you've got the police state on top, you've got the
[2:04:30.500 --> 2:04:36.020]  distudio branch, the legislative branch, the executive branch, then you have the shadow
[2:04:36.020 --> 2:04:42.660]  government, which is the CFR, the trilateral commission, and then the big kahuna, obviously
[2:04:42.660 --> 2:04:51.780]  the Bilderberg group. And this is how everything is concocted. This is how everybody regulates
[2:04:51.780 --> 2:04:59.500]  what people think about, how it gets influenced, and if Obama is just so polarized.
[2:04:59.500 --> 2:05:02.260]  Now I hear you, we're going to come back with more calls straight ahead.
[2:05:02.260 --> 2:05:08.140]  The Silver Lungs Generator is the only all-encompassing professional-class product for producing endless
[2:05:08.140 --> 2:05:13.460]  colloidal and ionic silver solutions right from the convenience of your home. With recent

[2:07:01.180 --> 2:07:06.100]  Aaron Fullen here. As the food police shut down food co-ops, the Amish and small farmers,
[2:07:06.100 --> 2:07:09.820]  Americans are losing access, not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses, but to healthy
[2:07:09.820 --> 2:07:14.220]  home-crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut, yogurt, and kefir. It seems there's
[2:07:14.220 --> 2:07:18.580]  a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria. But frankly, I'm not
[2:07:18.580 --> 2:07:22.140]  sure what the food police are so afraid of. These remarkable foods have been around since
[2:07:22.140 --> 2:07:25.780]  the beginning of history, with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages
[2:07:25.780 --> 2:07:30.780]  being found across the globe in almost every culture. Even today, Japanese eat miso, Africans
[2:07:30.780 --> 2:07:35.340]  eat fermented porges, Koreans eat kamichi, and in India, fermented milk is a staple for
[2:07:35.340 --> 2:07:36.340]  healthy living.
[2:07:36.340 --> 2:07:40.140]  But here's some good news. South Berlin Americans can now discover the secrets to making these
[2:07:40.140 --> 2:07:44.340]  amazing fermented foods legally and privately in their own homes. Since it's still legal
[2:07:44.340 --> 2:07:47.860]  to make these foods as long as you can make them yourself. For more information, check
[2:07:47.860 --> 2:07:53.340]  out fermentationfactor.com. That's fermentationfactor.com. It's easy to create your own powerful
[2:07:53.340 --> 2:08:00.340]  fermented foods, and you can do it by going to www.fermentationfactor.com. That's www.fermentationfactor.com.
[2:08:23.340 --> 2:08:30.340]  It's Info Wars Money Bomb 2012. 48 hours to change the world. Here's freedom. InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com
[2:08:30.340 --> 2:08:37.340]  to read our mission and to see the amazing roster of guests we've got lined up, sharing
[2:08:37.340 --> 2:08:44.340]  their insights on liberty and resistance to tyranny. I got involved in radio and TV as
[2:08:44.340 --> 2:08:50.220]  well as filmmaking 17 years ago because I didn't like the direction I saw our country and our
[2:08:50.220 --> 2:08:55.220]  world going in. The attacks on basic freedoms like the Second Amendment, the move towards
[2:08:55.220 --> 2:09:17.220]  collectivism in the nanny state. And over the last decade and a half, InfoWars.com and my radio show and the films have become really part of the core
[2:09:17.220 --> 2:09:25.220]  resistance to tyranny worldwide. It seems like yesterday, but it was more than five years ago, and I was sitting in my small office of about 3,000 square feet and realized that we were already reaching millions of people a week and that we had a responsibility to expand our operations in the face of the globalist. It was listeners five years ago that demanded we have a money bomb and that we had a
[2:09:47.220 --> 2:09:54.220]  responsibility to expand our operations. We've gone from less than 10 crew members to more than 50 today. Five years ago I was reaching about 3 million people a week. Now it's 15 million a week conservatively. Imagine what will happen if you just tell one person a day about InfoWars.com or our news reports that are online. Imagine what will happen if you donate just $5 or $10. InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com and allow us to go to the next level and put the nightly news to the public.
[2:10:17.220 --> 2:10:44.220]  Out on Frida air satellite worldwide. No, that one action won't save the world, but it will trigger brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere that will bring down the globalist and restore humanity on the right path of justice and liberty and a level playing field. We have a choice, the globalist dark age of control freak technocracy or 1776 worldwide.
[2:10:44.220 --> 2:11:07.220]  This October 18th and 19th, from Thursday morning right through into Saturday morning, it's InfoWars Money Bomb 2012, 48 hours to change the world. I'll see you live with the free video and audio streams emanating from prisonplanet.com and InfoWars.com. I'm Alex Jones, defending liberty, resisting tyranny.
[2:11:07.220 --> 2:11:16.220]  That's right, and there's the promo video we put out a few days ago. Again, I came from nowhere on Access TV 17 years ago.
[2:11:16.220 --> 2:11:25.220]  Within about six months, got a little radio show that was offered to me because the program director saw the show and said, hey, you want a Saturday show?
[2:11:25.220 --> 2:11:40.220]  It became popular in about six months. I got a weeknight show and then it got syndicated back in 1998 and was a limited syndication. We've been as many as 100 stations before, you know, as few as 30 or 40. It goes up and down.
[2:11:40.220 --> 2:11:49.220]  Now we're over 130. The broadcast is really exploding because what we've talked about is becoming evident, but I'm not with some big giant network.
[2:11:49.220 --> 2:12:00.220]  I'm not. I mean, I'm running the show here and it is the donations once a year that help us budget in expanding.
[2:12:00.220 --> 2:12:07.220]  And this is our most important expansion ever. And quite frankly, I don't like getting up here asking for money. I'd rather just promote products and things.
[2:12:07.220 --> 2:12:17.220]  I think it's important to promote our local AM and FM stations, sponsor them. I mean, listen, the government's going to end up shutting everything down and taking your power away.
[2:12:17.220 --> 2:12:27.220]  They're scared of you using your money to, you know, basically vote with your dollars on so many issues and they love taking your money and then using it against you.
[2:12:27.220 --> 2:12:33.220]  They take your tax money and use it on TV shows and movies to promote Obamacare. That came out a few weeks ago.
[2:12:33.220 --> 2:12:38.220]  Billions of dollars. They take your money and use it for anti-gun messages, anti-family messages.
[2:12:38.220 --> 2:12:47.220]  See, we're here saying, hey, spread the word about the show, buy the products, whatever the case is to help fund us. Go there. Get an infoawards.com camouflage hat.
[2:12:47.220 --> 2:12:55.220]  Then we're going to your calls and more news. Go get a t-shirt. Go get some of the films and books that also help wake your friends and family up.
[2:12:55.220 --> 2:13:03.220]  But quite frankly, you got to sell a lot of DVDs and a lot of t-shirts to have a newspaper, to make films, to syndicate news production.
[2:13:03.220 --> 2:13:08.220]  We're building a news organization to put out even more quality, crafted information.
[2:13:08.220 --> 2:13:14.220]  This is a platform for all these amazing people fighting tyranny to come on. I mean, this is it.
[2:13:14.220 --> 2:13:20.220]  So go to infoawardsmoneybomb.com or link through at prisonplanet.com or infoawards.com.
[2:13:20.220 --> 2:13:24.220]  The whole top of the sites are banners that go there and donate on PayPal, credit card.
[2:13:24.220 --> 2:13:31.220]  You can also call and make a donation. I should point that out. 888-253-3139.
[2:13:31.220 --> 2:13:34.220]  And there'll be members of the crew here for the next 48 hours.
[2:13:34.220 --> 2:13:40.220]  Now the next, you know, 46 or so or 43.
[2:13:40.220 --> 2:13:46.220]  Time is really flying by. I don't know. Take two, three hours off of 48. See if I can do the math.
[2:13:46.220 --> 2:13:50.220]  The next 45 hours or so or more, 45 and a half or so.
[2:13:50.220 --> 2:13:57.220]  So infoawardsmoneybomb.com or 888-253-3139.
[2:13:57.220 --> 2:14:01.220]  Plus it makes the globalists really, really angry. You know, George Soros groups out there,
[2:14:01.220 --> 2:14:06.220]  media matters run by the White House and funded by George Soros, the Think Progress and stuff.
[2:14:06.220 --> 2:14:11.220]  They always pull their hair out about our audience and that we're reaching more people and, oh, isn't it horrible?
[2:14:11.220 --> 2:14:14.220]  And, you know, let's shut down their funding and let's do this and that.
[2:14:14.220 --> 2:14:17.220]  And there's all sorts of dirty tricks behind the scenes.
[2:14:17.220 --> 2:14:22.220]  They cannot stand that little people give donations or spread the word.
[2:14:22.220 --> 2:14:31.220]  And it can't be some big international banker like Soros, you know, with one big, big, you know, milky to feed their whole operation.
[2:14:31.220 --> 2:14:39.220]  It's lots of you out there supporting us that is enabling us to reach so many more people.
[2:14:39.220 --> 2:14:42.220]  And going into this depression, who knows how bad it's going to get.
[2:14:42.220 --> 2:14:45.220]  You know, that's one thing. I could exhaust a little bit of backup.
[2:14:45.220 --> 2:14:51.220]  We've got money to run this place for a few months if everything was turned off and expand.
[2:14:51.220 --> 2:14:56.220]  But then I can't do that really. I guess I could hustle and turn the show into an infomercial.
[2:14:56.220 --> 2:15:00.220]  I don't do a lot of plugging compared to a lot of shows. I could do that, I guess.
[2:15:00.220 --> 2:15:03.220]  The point is we're going to pay for this one way or another.
[2:15:03.220 --> 2:15:07.220]  And the money bombs have been a very important part of this and I'm going to thank all of you that have given.
[2:15:07.220 --> 2:15:14.220]  But if you haven't gone to InfoWars Money Bomb and donated down the road, I mean, I hope we beat the globalist.
[2:15:14.220 --> 2:15:17.220]  I mean, I guess if people don't want to donate, that's kind of running up the white flag.
[2:15:17.220 --> 2:15:21.220]  So, you know, what's the point? We have a good chance of beating these people.
[2:15:21.220 --> 2:15:24.220]  Things are pretty much probably going to collapse to a certain extent.
[2:15:24.220 --> 2:15:30.220]  But if we expose the globalist, then they're going to get the blame for it and get thrown out and run out of town.
[2:15:30.220 --> 2:15:34.220]  If we don't, they're going to use the crisis to totally take over and that's their plan.
[2:15:34.220 --> 2:15:38.220]  Okay, enough of me ranting and raving. Let's go to Anthony in New York.
[2:15:38.220 --> 2:15:40.220]  Thanks for holding, sir. You're on the air.
[2:15:40.220 --> 2:15:43.220]  How are you doing now? Thanks for everything, man. I appreciate it.
[2:15:43.220 --> 2:15:47.220]  I want to bring up two quick points or two quick things real quick.
[2:15:47.220 --> 2:15:52.220]  Talk about this race riot. I remember about a month and a half, two months ago,
[2:15:52.220 --> 2:15:59.220]  Doug Hagman on your show talked about the very same thing that there was trying to provide the door, his race riot.
[2:15:59.220 --> 2:16:08.220]  You know, I'd forgotten Hagman came on and said that his FBI source was saying that the White House was planning a false flag.
[2:16:08.220 --> 2:16:13.220]  And I said, what is it? And he said it's civil unrest.
[2:16:13.220 --> 2:16:18.220]  You know, we got to get Hagman back on. There's a few blocks we've got where it says I'm doing news.
[2:16:18.220 --> 2:16:25.220]  But one of those open slots today or tomorrow, I wanted to leave a few open for special guests, but let's get Hagman on.
[2:16:25.220 --> 2:16:29.220]  But see, it's not powerful. I don't play him saying that on the nightly news.
[2:16:29.220 --> 2:16:36.220]  I remember him saying it two months ago and then I don't ever have the crew to go get all these clips of where our guests are breaking this down.
[2:16:36.220 --> 2:16:39.220]  But yes, thanks for reminding me.
[2:16:39.220 --> 2:16:45.220]  Yeah, definitely. Also, I want to bring up is I like to probably announce that I'm part of the InfoWare.
[2:16:45.220 --> 2:16:51.220]  I just went to my public access channel and I'm starting my own alternative media show on my channel.
[2:16:51.220 --> 2:16:58.220]  I will also like to know how I will go about possibly giving you on as a guest to your site for my show.
[2:16:58.220 --> 2:17:06.220]  Sir, I have to be honest with you. I even turned down BBC and ABC News and people now when they want to come here.
[2:17:06.220 --> 2:17:11.220]  Just because if I do all those big interviews, they cut them up anyways to make me look bad.
[2:17:11.220 --> 2:17:16.220]  And they want hours and hours of my time. I still do big syndicated radio shows.
[2:17:16.220 --> 2:17:21.220]  Not because I'm important. It's that I literally some days work 18 hours.
[2:17:21.220 --> 2:17:24.220]  And I've committed to spend at least three hours a day with my children.
[2:17:24.220 --> 2:17:31.220]  I still do things like Man Cal Show, Coast to Coast AM with John B. Wells and George Norrie, people like that.
[2:17:31.220 --> 2:17:35.220]  I would love to do shows. That's part of the reason I've hired.
[2:17:35.220 --> 2:17:41.220]  We've now got like eight or nine reporters is that I'm putting them to the paces. They're all doing really great.
[2:17:41.220 --> 2:17:47.220]  You know, kind of giving them some of the do's and don'ts and pitfalls so they can come on your shows.
[2:17:47.220 --> 2:17:52.220]  But I do need to try to do that. It's just there isn't time in the day.
[2:17:52.220 --> 2:17:57.220]  One of my greatest frustrations is I spend so much of my time just trying to fund this operation
[2:17:57.220 --> 2:18:04.220]  and messing with all sorts of, you know, little dirty deeds that go on and little sneaky attacks and other things.
[2:18:04.220 --> 2:18:06.220]  But by the grace of God, we just keep going forward.
[2:18:06.220 --> 2:18:10.220]  But when does your show start or tell us what cable system it is?
[2:18:10.220 --> 2:18:14.220]  This will be Time Warner Cable, Rochester, New York, Channel 15.
[2:18:14.220 --> 2:18:17.220]  And I'm starting the show in exactly probably six weeks.
[2:18:17.220 --> 2:18:22.220]  If that goes to the, you know, learn how to use our equipment.
[2:18:22.220 --> 2:18:25.220]  Sure, because of the orientation, which is a great way to get trained quick on cameras and editing.
[2:18:25.220 --> 2:18:27.220]  God bless you. Good to hear that.
[2:18:27.220 --> 2:18:30.220]  Yeah, everybody should use Access TV while it's still around.
[2:18:30.220 --> 2:18:33.220]  They're trying to shut it down everywhere. I mean, there are big audiences.
[2:18:33.220 --> 2:18:37.220]  It's on basic cable. Even in small towns, they've got nice audiences.
[2:18:37.220 --> 2:18:42.220]  You know, globalists will fly thousands of miles to talk to 200 people at a rotary club to influence.
[2:18:42.220 --> 2:18:47.220]  They spend all their time, the Federal Reserve has thousands of agents out there, you know, brainwashing
[2:18:47.220 --> 2:18:52.220]  at public schools and colleges and events and rotary clubs and Masonic halls.
[2:18:52.220 --> 2:18:56.220]  Well, let me tell you something, folks. I started out on Access TV.
[2:18:56.220 --> 2:18:58.220]  You do an Access show and do a pretty good job.
[2:18:58.220 --> 2:19:03.220]  You can use that to go get a local talk station for no pay.
[2:19:03.220 --> 2:19:09.220]  But you can usually have a product or something you sell to do a Sunday or Saturday show.
[2:19:09.220 --> 2:19:16.220]  Just try. And then if you do good there, you're going to find yourself in a year filling in for the local host.
[2:19:16.220 --> 2:19:18.220]  And then you're going to find yourself hosting.
[2:19:18.220 --> 2:19:23.220]  I mean, I'm telling you, so much of this world is just taking action.
[2:19:23.220 --> 2:19:29.220]  And there are so many great patriots out there who are well-spoken, informed, who have passion.
[2:19:29.220 --> 2:19:31.220]  Get an Access show. Get a local radio show.
[2:19:31.220 --> 2:19:35.220]  I've told business owners, hey, you're well-spoken.
[2:19:35.220 --> 2:19:40.220]  Go into the local talk station and say, hey, I'll sponsor, you know, my tile company
[2:19:40.220 --> 2:19:43.220]  or my lumber company or my restaurant.
[2:19:43.220 --> 2:19:47.220]  But I'd like with my buddy, you know, to do a one-hour radio show.
[2:19:47.220 --> 2:19:48.220]  Just give it a try.
[2:19:48.220 --> 2:19:51.220]  Yeah, okay, we got some open slots, you know, Sunday morning.
[2:19:51.220 --> 2:19:53.220]  You want to do it? Or sure.
[2:19:53.220 --> 2:19:55.220]  Go in there, talk about topics, take calls.
[2:19:55.220 --> 2:19:57.220]  Hey, you want two hours?
[2:19:57.220 --> 2:19:59.220]  This is how we get the word out.
[2:19:59.220 --> 2:20:01.220]  This is how we take over.
[2:20:01.220 --> 2:20:06.220]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why
[2:20:06.220 --> 2:20:09.220]  even if I had a pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving.
[2:20:09.220 --> 2:20:14.220]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on
[2:20:14.220 --> 2:20:17.220]  here in the United States and across the industrialized world
[2:20:17.220 --> 2:20:22.220]  are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements
[2:20:22.220 --> 2:20:27.220]  that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[2:20:27.220 --> 2:20:31.220]  We searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there
[2:20:31.220 --> 2:20:33.220]  and discovered Young Jevity.
[2:20:33.220 --> 2:20:37.220]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need,
[2:20:37.220 --> 2:20:41.220]  and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[2:20:41.220 --> 2:20:47.220]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[2:20:47.220 --> 2:20:49.220]  Check it out for yourself. It's incredible.

[2:22:03.220 --> 2:22:06.220]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house
[2:22:06.220 --> 2:22:08.220]  that looks like no one is home.
[2:22:08.220 --> 2:22:10.220]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[2:22:10.220 --> 2:22:14.220]  Make it look like someone is home watching television with fake TV.
[2:22:14.220 --> 2:22:18.220]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television.
[2:22:18.220 --> 2:22:21.220]  So from outside, it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[2:22:21.220 --> 2:22:25.220]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[2:22:25.220 --> 2:22:29.220]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less in an alarm,
[2:22:29.220 --> 2:22:32.220]  and is highly recommended by numerous police departments.
[2:22:32.220 --> 2:22:34.220]  Use it any time you're away from home.

[2:24:20.220 --> 2:24:24.220]  And I'll continue with your calls right into the fourth hour, the fifth hour, the sixth hour.
[2:24:24.220 --> 2:24:27.220]  We've got a bunch of special guests coming up.
[2:24:27.220 --> 2:24:31.220]  Really, this show is about getting out of the trance. It's about caring.
[2:24:31.220 --> 2:24:35.220]  It's about believing that we can turn things around. I know we can.
[2:24:35.220 --> 2:24:41.220]  But we have to stop being a bunch of jellyfish followers and really put our money where our mouth is.
[2:24:41.220 --> 2:24:45.220]  Put our energy where our mouth is.
[2:24:45.220 --> 2:24:48.220]  It's fun to fight tyranny. What's not fun is to lay down to it.
[2:24:48.220 --> 2:24:51.220]  Let's go to Mark in Tennessee. I appreciate you holding Mark.
[2:24:51.220 --> 2:24:53.220]  Welcome to the airwave, sir.
[2:24:53.220 --> 2:24:58.220]  Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Jones, for taking my call. I just wanted to let you know this is my first time, my first time caller.
[2:24:58.220 --> 2:25:01.220]  I've been listening to you guys for roughly about a year now.
[2:25:01.220 --> 2:25:06.220]  And I'm out of FEMA region number two. And speaking on FEMA region number two,
[2:25:06.220 --> 2:25:11.220]  I just wanted to maybe, you know, through your social network or the people that you're in contact with.
[2:25:11.220 --> 2:25:18.220]  Have you heard anything about the extra beef up security as far as, you know, our borders or our way stations with TSA?
[2:25:18.220 --> 2:25:23.220]  Last month, I'm an over-the-road truck driver. And last month, twice now,
[2:25:23.220 --> 2:25:28.220]  I've been stopped on Interstate 40 coming out of Arkansas on Interstate 40.
[2:25:28.220 --> 2:25:32.220]  And then coming southbound out of Kentucky, getting stopped at the way stations there.
[2:25:32.220 --> 2:25:38.220]  I've noticed that TSA is, you know, more adamant or more in Tennessee that I've noticed, you know,
[2:25:38.220 --> 2:25:40.220]  because I drive out west through the Midwest.
[2:25:40.220 --> 2:25:50.220]  Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Actually, in our film, Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, we spend in two and a half hours, probably 30 minutes on Tennessee.
[2:25:50.220 --> 2:25:58.220]  Tennessee, they're worried about people in Tennessee because they know you're independent and you're wily and you're not idiots.
[2:25:58.220 --> 2:26:01.220]  It was mainly Tennesseans. It was some Alabamans and Carolinans as well.
[2:26:01.220 --> 2:26:05.220]  It was mainly Tennesseans is why it's called the Volunteer State that came down and founded Texas.
[2:26:05.220 --> 2:26:10.220]  Most of the people that died at the Alamo were Tennesseans. So the globalists absolutely hate your guts.
[2:26:10.220 --> 2:26:14.220]  They see you as Americana as it gets, and they absolutely hate you.
[2:26:14.220 --> 2:26:17.220]  And if they can break Tennessee, they can break anybody.
[2:26:17.220 --> 2:26:24.220]  And for out of state, no, out of congressmen on from their anti-state rep, they have Army checkpoints.
[2:26:24.220 --> 2:26:30.220]  But TSA commands them, and they're now setting up these group rooms where they're dragging families in.
[2:26:30.220 --> 2:26:32.220]  They're not just doing commercial vehicles.
[2:26:32.220 --> 2:26:38.220]  You haven't run through the ones that have been in Tennessee news yet where they actually top everybody.
[2:26:38.220 --> 2:26:44.220]  And TSA does a full throw your stuff out everywhere, violates the Fourth Amendment, the Tenth Amendment.
[2:26:44.220 --> 2:26:50.220]  They're also not sworn peace officers on top of it, and it's just the feds coming in there.
[2:26:50.220 --> 2:26:58.220]  They also do Tennessee and the four states around you, but they admit Tennessee is their test ground for that type of activity.
[2:26:58.220 --> 2:27:02.220]  And yeah, no, but hey buddy, don't feel bad.
[2:27:02.220 --> 2:27:08.220]  They're also now having TSA north of Austin. They've had them in Round Rock, we've now confirmed.
[2:27:08.220 --> 2:27:15.220]  They have Army checkpoints, sometimes down in Kyle, and they have TSA on the streets in Dallas, Houston,
[2:27:15.220 --> 2:27:20.220]  and then they have MPs on the streets in San Antonio who are arresting citizens.
[2:27:20.220 --> 2:27:25.220]  So it's on. And it's just all getting us ready for the total collapse.
[2:27:25.220 --> 2:27:31.220]  But what's incredible is the TSA has these big scanners too.
[2:27:31.220 --> 2:27:36.220]  And they'll be out there with the Army or National Guard and they drive you under the scanners.
[2:27:36.220 --> 2:27:38.220]  And these are high powered. These are many times.
[2:27:38.220 --> 2:27:43.220]  I've had radiologists on there about 10 times the power of a chest x-ray, some of the units they've shown on the news.
[2:27:43.220 --> 2:27:47.220]  And they have TSA standing out under it all day and they drive you under it.
[2:27:47.220 --> 2:27:49.220]  It's totally illegal, but they don't care.
[2:27:49.220 --> 2:27:52.220]  You see, it's all time to die now. It's time to be radiated.
[2:27:52.220 --> 2:27:57.220]  It's time to take vaccines. It's time to just get everybody used to everybody starting to get cancer.
[2:27:57.220 --> 2:28:04.220]  And these troops in TSA just stand around all day under high powered x-rays that shoot through cars,
[2:28:04.220 --> 2:28:10.220]  quote, looking for weapons and drugs and terrorists, terrorists that they openly run in Libya and Syria.
[2:28:10.220 --> 2:28:15.220]  So you say you're really getting to enjoy the TSA there, huh?
[2:28:15.220 --> 2:28:21.220]  Oh, yeah, it's just wonderful. It's great losing my liberties and being controlled by somebody other than myself.
[2:28:21.220 --> 2:28:30.220]  You know, our Constitution allows us to be controllers of ourself, you know, guided by God, not by, you know, the people.
[2:28:30.220 --> 2:28:35.220]  In innocent until proven guilty. And now you are guilty, guilty, guilty.
[2:28:35.220 --> 2:28:38.220]  It's not even guilty until proven innocent. It's slave.
[2:28:38.220 --> 2:28:43.220]  And you're going to be in pecked by a potbelly, TSA, and that's the end of it.
[2:28:43.220 --> 2:28:48.220]  That's the new freedom. Because after all, al-Qaeda might get us.
[2:28:48.220 --> 2:28:51.220]  What is it like whenever you run into them?
[2:28:51.220 --> 2:29:00.220]  Well, I had, whenever I was coming out of Kentucky on 75, I had one of the TSA officers actually come up into my truck.
[2:29:00.220 --> 2:29:02.220]  They're not officers, by the way. They're goons.
[2:29:02.220 --> 2:29:07.220]  Well, right. They're not foreign officers, of course they're not, but you know, they act like they're in control.
[2:29:07.220 --> 2:29:13.220]  Come up into my truck, ask me questions. Of course, I had your radio station on in my truck, you know, and instantly I had to turn it off
[2:29:13.220 --> 2:29:17.220]  because they were asking me questions about that, which just gave them, you know, more info.
[2:29:17.220 --> 2:29:20.220]  Hold on, they were asking you questions about my show.
[2:29:20.220 --> 2:29:21.220]  Absolutely, yes.
[2:29:21.220 --> 2:29:26.220]  Imagine, in America, what are you, you scumbag American listening to?
[2:29:26.220 --> 2:29:32.220]  That's a secret police, North Korean officer. Only in North Korea would they say what's on your radio.
[2:29:32.220 --> 2:29:34.220]  And so what did you say to them about that?
[2:29:34.220 --> 2:29:39.220]  Well, I told them, I told them it's a well-informed radio station, it's an alternative radio station.
[2:29:39.220 --> 2:29:42.220]  I'll listen to, you know, besides listening to Fox News.
[2:29:42.220 --> 2:29:47.220]  I got Greg Powell's coming up, but can you just briefly finish the story? We'll get Greg online, but I've got to hear this.
[2:29:47.220 --> 2:29:50.220]  I mean, yeah, I mean, Fox, this country's in deep trouble.
[2:29:50.220 --> 2:29:54.220]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.

[2:32:39.220 --> 2:32:41.220]  The book that woke me up.
[2:32:41.220 --> 2:32:45.220]  We're also carrying behind the green mask, You and Agenda 21 by Rosa Corey.
[2:32:45.220 --> 2:32:48.220]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.

[2:32:55.220 --> 2:33:00.220]  These titles and a lot more are all available at infowarshop.com.
[2:33:00.220 --> 2:33:09.220]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind.
[2:33:09.220 --> 2:33:13.220]  There was something so pleasant about that place.
[2:33:13.220 --> 2:33:15.220]  Even your emotions have an echo.
[2:33:15.220 --> 2:33:18.220]  It is the special forty eight hour broadcast.
[2:33:18.220 --> 2:33:20.220]  He'll be with us a little bit into the next hour.
[2:33:20.220 --> 2:33:25.220]  Greg Palace, BBC, ABC reporter, best selling investigative journalist, author.
[2:33:25.220 --> 2:33:28.220]  Mitt Romney's bailout, Bonanza will be looking at that in his new book.
[2:33:28.220 --> 2:33:32.220]  I haven't had a chance to read it yet, but I've looked at the graphics and cartoons and it looks pretty cool.
[2:33:32.220 --> 2:33:37.220]  Billionaires and bailout bandits, how to steal an election in nine easy steps.
[2:33:37.220 --> 2:33:40.220]  So we're going to hear from him on that perspective.
[2:33:40.220 --> 2:33:47.220]  I know he's a nonpartisan guy, but we want to hear the scoop on both parties and what's going on.
[2:33:47.220 --> 2:33:55.220]  Before we go to him, I want to go back to Mark in Tennessee who's a truck driver who says he's constantly going through TSA checkpoints.
[2:33:55.220 --> 2:33:58.220]  That's on the news, but they have the TSA going back through four years.
[2:33:58.220 --> 2:33:59.220]  I have newscast of this.
[2:33:59.220 --> 2:34:07.220]  It's in my film, police state four rise of FEMA that you can buy the DVD of it in full wars.com or it's free online.
[2:34:07.220 --> 2:34:11.220]  Again, that's something we do here is we make these films that are seen by tens of millions.
[2:34:11.220 --> 2:34:16.220]  You can get a DVD if you want to support us, but it's about warning people.
[2:34:16.220 --> 2:34:18.220]  So I have an army colonel on about it.
[2:34:18.220 --> 2:34:24.220]  I have a state rep on about it where they have TSA checkpoints actually dragging families out of their vehicles.
[2:34:24.220 --> 2:34:29.220]  And we have footage of it, but this poor guy, he has my radio show on.
[2:34:29.220 --> 2:34:31.220]  He's sitting there at the TSA checkpoint.
[2:34:31.220 --> 2:34:33.220]  The guy climbs in and says, what is that?
[2:34:33.220 --> 2:34:36.220]  Well, obviously the TSA all know who I am.
[2:34:36.220 --> 2:34:39.220]  I just was getting some threatening letter from the TSA just the other day.
[2:34:39.220 --> 2:34:40.220]  They're actually now threatening us.
[2:34:40.220 --> 2:34:41.220]  I'm going to get to that later.
[2:34:41.220 --> 2:34:42.220]  I'm talking to my lawyers first.
[2:34:42.220 --> 2:34:46.220]  The point is, is that they want you to sit down and shut up.
[2:34:46.220 --> 2:34:49.220]  And I told you 10 years ago, they're going to be on the streets.
[2:34:49.220 --> 2:34:53.220]  They're going to be on the malls and they're going to wave a wand for any police and say,
[2:34:53.220 --> 2:34:58.220]  you're now allowed to violate people's rights because they're unsworn federal out of control bureaucrats.
[2:34:58.220 --> 2:35:00.220]  They're pirates.
[2:35:00.220 --> 2:35:05.220]  Individual TSA agents, aren't really agents, may not be evil themselves,
[2:35:05.220 --> 2:35:10.220]  but the system is a occupation takeover, dog training takeover.
[2:35:10.220 --> 2:35:14.220]  So briefly as we're going to Greg Palast finishing your story, Mark,
[2:35:14.220 --> 2:35:17.220]  because I know they do have the checkpoints like nowhere else all over the place in Tennessee,
[2:35:17.220 --> 2:35:21.220]  where sometimes they shut down a whole highways and don't just search, quote,
[2:35:21.220 --> 2:35:24.220]  transportation vehicles that have waived, you know, their rights.
[2:35:24.220 --> 2:35:26.220]  So he climbs up in your cab.
[2:35:26.220 --> 2:35:27.220]  I mean, what was it about my show?
[2:35:27.220 --> 2:35:30.220]  He heard that he instantly didn't like because I guess in America,
[2:35:30.220 --> 2:35:33.220]  you know, the political officers are like, what are you listening to?
[2:35:33.220 --> 2:35:35.220]  What do you think this is America?
[2:35:35.220 --> 2:35:36.220]  So I mean, describe how that happened.
[2:35:36.220 --> 2:35:37.220]  Then we're going to Greg Palast.
[2:35:37.220 --> 2:35:38.220]  All right.
[2:35:38.220 --> 2:35:41.220]  Well, real, real quickly, brief, to be perfectly honest with me,
[2:35:41.220 --> 2:35:46.220]  I believe what set the whole atmosphere is on my truck on both the passenger and the driver side.
[2:35:46.220 --> 2:35:49.220]  I have stickers on my truck that, you know, that says, Patriot on board.
[2:35:49.220 --> 2:35:52.220]  So I believe that's probably what started, you know, the...
[2:35:52.220 --> 2:35:53.220]  No, no, that's good.
[2:35:53.220 --> 2:35:57.220]  We need to shove it in their face because they say we're the terrorists,
[2:35:57.220 --> 2:36:00.220]  people that are real Americans in the new manuals, the veterans.
[2:36:00.220 --> 2:36:01.220]  We are the evil people.
[2:36:01.220 --> 2:36:02.220]  So, all right.
[2:36:02.220 --> 2:36:04.220]  So you go to Patriot?
[2:36:04.220 --> 2:36:08.220]  Of course, you know, I've got the radio station and I've turned it down so that they can, you know,
[2:36:08.220 --> 2:36:10.220]  we can, you know, communicate back and forth.
[2:36:10.220 --> 2:36:12.220]  And then, you know, they hear it and they're like, well, what is this?
[2:36:12.220 --> 2:36:13.220]  What radio station?
[2:36:13.220 --> 2:36:18.220]  Well, that's Mr. Alex Jones, you know, Info Wars, you know, and they're screaming and yelling.
[2:36:18.220 --> 2:36:20.220]  We need to see your driver's license.
[2:36:20.220 --> 2:36:21.220]  We need to see your...
[2:36:21.220 --> 2:36:22.220]  Wait a minute.
[2:36:22.220 --> 2:36:26.220]  So when they heard my name, it was like vampires at high noon.
[2:36:26.220 --> 2:36:31.220]  I think they're, you know, things that my dad can draw every bit of my Patriot blood out of me, you know,
[2:36:31.220 --> 2:36:34.220]  so, you know, so they get up in my truck, you know, and of course, you know,
[2:36:34.220 --> 2:36:36.220]  I got a few things in there and they're like, well, you're traveling pretty loud.
[2:36:36.220 --> 2:36:39.220]  I mean, just stupid stuff.
[2:36:39.220 --> 2:36:41.220]  They were trying to imply you were a terrorist next.
[2:36:41.220 --> 2:36:43.220]  Well, you're traveling pretty loud, boy.
[2:36:43.220 --> 2:36:46.220]  It's not about not even having a criminal record.
[2:36:46.220 --> 2:36:48.220]  It's about your scum.
[2:36:48.220 --> 2:36:49.220]  They're God.
[2:36:49.220 --> 2:36:50.220]  Get used to it.
[2:36:50.220 --> 2:36:51.220]  Right.
[2:36:51.220 --> 2:36:52.220]  Absolutely.
[2:36:52.220 --> 2:36:53.220]  So what else happened at the end of it?
[2:36:53.220 --> 2:36:54.220]  What happened at the end of it?
[2:36:54.220 --> 2:36:56.220]  Well, basically, you know, and I'm trying to handle my law,
[2:36:56.220 --> 2:36:58.220]  but let them know, you know, that I am a Biden by the law.
[2:36:58.220 --> 2:36:59.220]  They didn't want to see my law book.
[2:36:59.220 --> 2:37:00.220]  They just took my license.
[2:37:00.220 --> 2:37:04.220]  They didn't go back to the car or do anything or go back into the building and check me out.
[2:37:04.220 --> 2:37:06.220]  They really didn't want any...
[2:37:06.220 --> 2:37:07.220]  They know you're good.
[2:37:07.220 --> 2:37:09.220]  It's why they don't like you.
[2:37:09.220 --> 2:37:12.220]  What they see was the Patriot on board on the side of my truck,
[2:37:12.220 --> 2:37:15.220]  and I believe that's what started the whole, you know, the whole catastrophe,
[2:37:15.220 --> 2:37:19.220]  and then of course they held me up for a good 45 minutes to an hour for nothing.
[2:37:19.220 --> 2:37:20.220]  Absolutely.
[2:37:20.220 --> 2:37:21.220]  No, no, no.
[2:37:21.220 --> 2:37:23.220]  They've told my crew, you don't want to be putting a microwave oven.
[2:37:23.220 --> 2:37:25.220]  You're going away to now and miss your flight.
[2:37:25.220 --> 2:37:28.220]  And then we just start talking real loud about the tyranny.
[2:37:28.220 --> 2:37:30.220]  They don't want to get the other sheep aware.
[2:37:30.220 --> 2:37:31.220]  So then they move you through.
[2:37:31.220 --> 2:37:35.220]  It's all about a gang of nobodies sticking their hands down your wife's pants.
[2:37:35.220 --> 2:37:36.220]  I appreciate your call.
[2:37:36.220 --> 2:37:37.220]  All right.
[2:37:37.220 --> 2:37:38.220]  Let's go to Greg Palace.
[2:37:38.220 --> 2:37:40.220]  They'll be with us a little bit in the next hour.
[2:37:40.220 --> 2:37:43.220]  Then we're going to get Sean Stone on continued 48 hour broadcast.
[2:37:43.220 --> 2:37:45.220]  Can't wait to sit down and read this little book.
[2:37:45.220 --> 2:37:47.220]  Billionaires and bailout bandits.
[2:37:47.220 --> 2:37:52.220]  Greg Palace investigates the Koch gang, Carl Rove, and their buck buddies.
[2:37:52.220 --> 2:37:58.220]  Thought we'd look some over at the neocon arm of the New World Order buzzard.
[2:37:58.220 --> 2:38:01.220]  We've been covering a lot of the Obama side of the buzzard.
[2:38:01.220 --> 2:38:05.220]  But first off, what do you think Greg Palace of the TSA?
[2:38:05.220 --> 2:38:07.220]  I mean, maybe they're not doing enough.
[2:38:07.220 --> 2:38:10.220]  Maybe they should be doing proctology exams on people.
[2:38:10.220 --> 2:38:18.220]  Well, I got to tell you, you know, I did some stories on total information awareness.
[2:38:18.220 --> 2:38:19.220]  Remember that?
[2:38:19.220 --> 2:38:22.220]  Remember they had that, you know, the pyramid, the Illuminati pyramid?
[2:38:22.220 --> 2:38:24.220]  Run my point Dexter, yeah.
[2:38:24.220 --> 2:38:26.220]  With your eyeball in the middle of the forehead.
[2:38:26.220 --> 2:38:29.220]  I mean, it was like, it was, you know, you know what that was?
[2:38:29.220 --> 2:38:31.220]  It's all about making money, Alex.
[2:38:31.220 --> 2:38:32.220]  Follow the money.
[2:38:32.220 --> 2:38:38.220]  You had big companies like Choice Point, like this billionaire Ken Langone, all mobbed up
[2:38:38.220 --> 2:38:40.220]  with the politicians.
[2:38:40.220 --> 2:38:46.220]  And they got billions and billions of dollars in no bid contracts to, you know, basically
[2:38:46.220 --> 2:38:50.220]  say you and your mommy and your neighbor were all suspects.
[2:38:50.220 --> 2:38:54.220]  You know, like I thought that we were on September 11th, we were all the victims.
[2:38:54.220 --> 2:38:57.220]  But on September 12th, we all became the suspects.
[2:38:57.220 --> 2:38:58.220]  Well, that's right.
[2:38:58.220 --> 2:38:59.220]  That Senate report came out last week.
[2:38:59.220 --> 2:39:02.220]  You've written about that where they admitted not one terrorist ever caught.
[2:39:02.220 --> 2:39:05.220]  Tens of millions of us now on list as terrorists.
[2:39:05.220 --> 2:39:10.220]  Yeah, so they have these terrorist lists, you know, so it keeps them in business.
[2:39:10.220 --> 2:39:11.220]  And that's the game.
[2:39:11.220 --> 2:39:14.220]  I mean, a lot of guys are cranking a lot of money out of this.
[2:39:14.220 --> 2:39:17.220]  I mean, you know, there's other aspects that you cover about civil liberties.
[2:39:17.220 --> 2:39:20.220]  But, you know, I'm an economic investigator and I'm following.
[2:39:20.220 --> 2:39:24.220]  You're a former federal white collar crime investigator at the highest levels.
[2:39:24.220 --> 2:39:28.220]  Yeah, well, but since the federal government is now run by white collar criminals, I kind
[2:39:28.220 --> 2:39:30.220]  of am out of a job there.
[2:39:30.220 --> 2:39:32.220]  So I went to journalism.
[2:39:32.220 --> 2:39:33.220]  That's not a joke.
[2:39:33.220 --> 2:39:34.220]  It's a joke, but it's not that funny.
[2:39:34.220 --> 2:39:35.220]  No, it's not a joke.
[2:39:35.220 --> 2:39:36.220]  How you know how to read?
[2:39:36.220 --> 2:39:38.220]  You're even worse than that last guy.
[2:39:38.220 --> 2:39:39.220]  Listen to the radio.
[2:39:39.220 --> 2:39:42.220]  Yeah, I mean, that was amazing that that story.
[2:39:42.220 --> 2:39:48.220]  But you know, that's that's the thing, you know, it's I'm very, very concerned that
[2:39:48.220 --> 2:39:52.220]  people are making too much money by taking away our liberties.
[2:39:52.220 --> 2:39:56.220]  Yeah, let's write that down because that's actually you get into that in your book,
[2:39:56.220 --> 2:39:59.220]  how they use these computer programs to disenfranchise voters.
[2:39:59.220 --> 2:40:00.220]  You name it.
[2:40:00.220 --> 2:40:05.220]  Get into billionaires and bailout bandits and our loving government.
[2:40:05.220 --> 2:40:09.220]  Yeah, well, this is a book put out by my foundation.
[2:40:09.220 --> 2:40:14.220]  It's basically a blast at both parties and their billionaires and the way that they
[2:40:14.220 --> 2:40:16.220]  shoplift votes.
[2:40:16.220 --> 2:40:21.220]  So for example, it's very, you know, for example, by the way, a lot of people talk about the
[2:40:21.220 --> 2:40:23.220]  Koch brothers as big Republican funders.
[2:40:23.220 --> 2:40:24.220]  That's this week.
[2:40:24.220 --> 2:40:26.220]  David Koch was going to run this.
[2:40:26.220 --> 2:40:32.220]  The four Koch brothers, by the way, are between them, they're worth a little over 50 billion
[2:40:32.220 --> 2:40:33.220]  dollars.
[2:40:33.220 --> 2:40:38.220]  Okay, David Koch was going to run for governor of Kansas as a Democrat, by the way.
[2:40:38.220 --> 2:40:44.220]  And Bill Clinton, you know, that guy, you know, that everyone now thinks is just a wonderful
[2:40:44.220 --> 2:40:45.220]  bubble.
[2:40:45.220 --> 2:40:46.220]  Yeah, Bill Clinton.
[2:40:46.220 --> 2:40:47.220]  Yeah.
[2:40:47.220 --> 2:40:48.220]  Yeah.
[2:40:48.220 --> 2:40:50.220]  Um, anyway, where did he come from?
[2:40:50.220 --> 2:40:55.220]  How do you become, go from a governor of a dog patch and come out of dog patch Arkansas,
[2:40:55.220 --> 2:40:58.220]  become president of the United States in four years?
[2:40:58.220 --> 2:41:02.220]  And the answer is that he rode something called the Democratic Leadership Council.
[2:41:02.220 --> 2:41:05.220]  Now, who created the Democratic Leadership Council?
[2:41:05.220 --> 2:41:09.220]  It started with $150,000 donation from the Koch brothers.
[2:41:09.220 --> 2:41:14.220]  At the same time, they gave $150,000 to Bob Dole, his opponent, who got caught because
[2:41:14.220 --> 2:41:18.220]  they gave it to Dole's foundation, foundation for a better America.
[2:41:18.220 --> 2:41:20.220]  And he thought America would be better off with him as president.
[2:41:20.220 --> 2:41:21.220]  That was illegal.
[2:41:21.220 --> 2:41:22.220]  He had to give the money back.
[2:41:22.220 --> 2:41:28.220]  These guys are playing, they don't bet on horses, Alex, they own the whole darn racetrack.
[2:41:28.220 --> 2:41:29.220]  That's right.
[2:41:29.220 --> 2:41:33.220]  You own all the sides like Don King in a heavyweight boxing match.
[2:41:33.220 --> 2:41:34.220]  You can't lose.
[2:41:34.220 --> 2:41:35.220]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:41:35.220 --> 2:41:37.220]  Well, that's, that's how it's played.
[2:41:37.220 --> 2:41:40.220]  And that's all right if they weren't getting something in return.
[2:41:40.220 --> 2:41:41.220]  And that's what I'm concerned about.
[2:41:41.220 --> 2:41:42.220]  Who's picking up their bills?
[2:41:42.220 --> 2:41:43.220]  What do you think?
[2:41:43.220 --> 2:41:48.220]  As, as Ken Langone, that guy was talking about, who's making money off the total information
[2:41:48.220 --> 2:41:49.220]  awareness stuff.
[2:41:49.220 --> 2:41:53.220]  As he said, he just gave a million dollars to Mitt Romney.
[2:41:53.220 --> 2:41:54.220]  He's not a Republican.
[2:41:54.220 --> 2:41:58.220]  He said, you know, I don't make donations to political candidates.
[2:41:58.220 --> 2:42:00.220]  I'm not giving Romney a million because it's a donation.
[2:42:00.220 --> 2:42:02.220]  I'm making an investment.
[2:42:02.220 --> 2:42:05.220]  I invest in him like I do any other product.
[2:42:05.220 --> 2:42:08.220]  And, you know, what's the return there?
[2:42:08.220 --> 2:42:10.220]  That's what I'm very concerned about.
[2:42:10.220 --> 2:42:16.220]  And obviously then there's a chapter in billionaires and ballot bandits called pennies from heaven.
[2:42:16.220 --> 2:42:19.220]  Where did Barack Obama come from?
[2:42:19.220 --> 2:42:23.220]  By the way, you know, it means Barack Obama means the blessed one we've been waiting for.
[2:42:23.220 --> 2:42:25.220]  Well, Alex, who was waiting for him?
[2:42:25.220 --> 2:42:26.220]  I'm sorry.
[2:42:26.220 --> 2:42:33.220]  Have you ever heard of anyone going from like the swap of the state Senate of Illinois,
[2:42:33.220 --> 2:42:34.220]  right?
[2:42:34.220 --> 2:42:36.220]  Which is a total swap.
[2:42:36.220 --> 2:42:38.220]  And four years later, he's in the White House.
[2:42:38.220 --> 2:42:39.220]  How does that happen?
[2:42:39.220 --> 2:42:42.220]  The answer is Penny Pritzker.
[2:42:42.220 --> 2:42:49.220]  She's worth $4 billion, was worth $4 billion, but then the feds hit her for a $400 million fine
[2:42:49.220 --> 2:42:53.220]  for predatory banking practices, fraud, predation.
[2:42:53.220 --> 2:42:55.220]  She's a loan shark.
[2:42:55.220 --> 2:42:57.220]  She's a convicted loan shark.
[2:42:57.220 --> 2:42:58.220]  She's a convicted loan shark.
[2:42:58.220 --> 2:42:59.220]  $400 billion fine.
[2:42:59.220 --> 2:43:01.220]  I don't think anyone's ever been fined that much.
[2:43:01.220 --> 2:43:02.220]  Who are the victims?
[2:43:02.220 --> 2:43:04.220]  The people in Obama's district, mainly.
[2:43:04.220 --> 2:43:06.220]  And then what does she do?
[2:43:06.220 --> 2:43:07.220]  Does Obama go after it?
[2:43:07.220 --> 2:43:08.220]  Not at all.
[2:43:08.220 --> 2:43:13.220]  In fact, she tells Obama, you'd make a terrific looking senator and loads him up.
[2:43:13.220 --> 2:43:17.220]  She was in charge of the fundraising for Obama for president.
[2:43:17.220 --> 2:43:21.220]  She raised three quarters of a billion dollars.
[2:43:21.220 --> 2:43:26.220]  Her friends on the Gold Coast shifted his district from poor black district to the Gold Coast
[2:43:26.220 --> 2:43:29.220]  of our long Lakeshore Drive in Chicago.
[2:43:29.220 --> 2:43:31.220]  She got her $400.
[2:43:31.220 --> 2:43:36.220]  She had her $400 million fine, but then she hooked him up with a group that she calls
[2:43:36.220 --> 2:43:38.220]  literally the ladies that luch.
[2:43:38.220 --> 2:43:44.220]  So they munched and lunched on Obama and then they turned him over to Citibank, Robert Rubin,
[2:43:44.220 --> 2:43:48.220]  and Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan.
[2:43:48.220 --> 2:43:52.220]  So you basically ended up with a banker president called Obama.
[2:43:52.220 --> 2:43:56.220]  See, that's what I love about you, though, is you're one of the few journalists out there
[2:43:56.220 --> 2:44:02.220]  that goes after the dirt period and attacks them all because then you realize it's like
[2:44:02.220 --> 2:44:03.220]  a Don King match.
[2:44:03.220 --> 2:44:04.220]  They own Romney.
[2:44:04.220 --> 2:44:05.220]  They own Obama.
[2:44:05.220 --> 2:44:10.220]  But I want to get your take then on the differences that if either man wins, what you expect to
[2:44:10.220 --> 2:44:15.220]  happen just briefly from your considerable political and journalistic gravitas.
[2:44:15.220 --> 2:44:20.220]  What is Greg Palis thinks going to happen if we get a Romney versus if we get Obama?
[2:44:20.220 --> 2:44:24.220]  There is a huge, you know, this is the first time in my career that I've ever seen the elite split
[2:44:24.220 --> 2:44:26.220]  in half the way it is, by the way, Alex.
[2:44:26.220 --> 2:44:28.220]  This is something very new.
[2:44:28.220 --> 2:44:29.220]  You've got a huge split.
[2:44:29.220 --> 2:44:34.220]  You've got these big bankers, Citibank, Bank of America, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs is kind
[2:44:34.220 --> 2:44:36.220]  of a switch hitter on this one.
[2:44:36.220 --> 2:44:38.220]  And on one side, they're backing Obama.
[2:44:38.220 --> 2:44:39.220]  They still are.
[2:44:39.220 --> 2:44:40.220]  That's not just from 2008.
[2:44:40.220 --> 2:44:45.220]  They're still in with Obama big, big time and Penny Pritzker.
[2:44:45.220 --> 2:44:50.220]  But then on the other side are these billionaire hedge fund sharks.
[2:44:50.220 --> 2:44:54.220]  And there's a rumble in the jungle and the financial jungle between them, which we haven't
[2:44:54.220 --> 2:44:55.220]  seen before.
[2:44:55.220 --> 2:44:56.220]  They were not splitting no aid.
[2:44:56.220 --> 2:44:58.220]  All of the finance guys are on Obama's side.
[2:44:58.220 --> 2:44:59.220]  Now they're splitting.
[2:44:59.220 --> 2:45:02.220]  So you're confirming what all my other experts are saying.
[2:45:02.220 --> 2:45:05.220]  There is a major power structure fight happening.
[2:45:05.220 --> 2:45:06.220]  Very rare.
[2:45:06.220 --> 2:45:07.220]  Yeah.
[2:45:07.220 --> 2:45:08.220]  Jets and sharks.
[2:45:08.220 --> 2:45:10.220]  But, you know, it's hidden from the American people.
[2:45:10.220 --> 2:45:13.220]  I mean, one of their big battles, for example, is over Argentina.
[2:45:13.220 --> 2:45:16.220]  Argentina told the bankers to go fly.
[2:45:16.220 --> 2:45:20.220]  You know, the IMF and the World Bank kind of took control of Argentina.
[2:45:20.220 --> 2:45:24.220]  They sold off the water system to Enron and everyone stopped having water.
[2:45:24.220 --> 2:45:25.220]  You know, that type of thing.
[2:45:25.220 --> 2:45:28.220]  And Argentina came back some as they finally kicked them out.
[2:45:28.220 --> 2:45:29.220]  Yeah.
[2:45:29.220 --> 2:45:30.220]  They kicked out the bankers.
[2:45:30.220 --> 2:45:33.220]  Paying the IMF, you know, screw you.
[2:45:33.220 --> 2:45:37.220]  And, but what happened was the banks quietly, people don't understand this.
[2:45:37.220 --> 2:45:39.220]  The banks quietly cut their deal with Argentina.
[2:45:39.220 --> 2:45:44.220]  Argentina came back roaring because they didn't have to pay these serious bank rates.
[2:45:44.220 --> 2:45:46.220]  So the banks said, what do you want to do?
[2:45:46.220 --> 2:45:49.220]  And they said, I'll tell you what, we'll basically give you kind of stock in Argentina.
[2:45:49.220 --> 2:45:51.220]  If our economy grows, we will send you money.
[2:45:51.220 --> 2:45:55.220]  And so the big banks in New York have been getting tons of money from Argentina.
[2:45:55.220 --> 2:45:57.220]  Forget all the stuff about the falls.
[2:45:57.220 --> 2:45:59.220]  They're getting tons of money.
[2:45:59.220 --> 2:46:04.220]  This, these vulture fund billionaires led by Paul the vulture singer.
[2:46:04.220 --> 2:46:06.220]  You remember my last book, vulture's picnic?
[2:46:06.220 --> 2:46:07.220]  Oh, yeah.
[2:46:07.220 --> 2:46:12.220]  Paul the vulture singer moves in, finds all these old Argentina bonds that are sitting around
[2:46:12.220 --> 2:46:14.220]  that don't mean anything anymore.
[2:46:14.220 --> 2:46:15.220]  And he suddenly says, you know what?
[2:46:15.220 --> 2:46:16.220]  I own Argentina.
[2:46:16.220 --> 2:46:17.220]  That's mine now.
[2:46:17.220 --> 2:46:21.220]  And not only that, do I own Argentina, but I own Bank of America.
[2:46:21.220 --> 2:46:22.220]  I own Citibank.
[2:46:22.220 --> 2:46:23.220]  I own JP Morgan.
[2:46:23.220 --> 2:46:24.220]  Give me.
[2:46:24.220 --> 2:46:27.220]  And he's looking for tens of billions of dollars.
[2:46:27.220 --> 2:46:33.220]  And might go up to as much as $200 billion by time he's done with his operation.
[2:46:33.220 --> 2:46:39.220]  He can bring down not only Argentina, but he can bring down, and I spoke to the Argentine
[2:46:39.220 --> 2:46:40.220]  ambassador.
[2:46:40.220 --> 2:46:41.220]  He says, you know, what are we going to do?
[2:46:41.220 --> 2:46:42.220]  We'll just turn into like a non state.
[2:46:42.220 --> 2:46:47.220]  You know, it has Bola will be running around here in charge at which, because they've moved
[2:46:47.220 --> 2:46:49.220]  in from the Middle East into Argentina.
[2:46:49.220 --> 2:46:52.220]  And but the big banks in New York could go down too.
[2:46:52.220 --> 2:46:56.220]  And so there's a, there's a blood battle between these groups.
[2:46:56.220 --> 2:47:03.220]  So what's happened is not because of Argentina's request or the countries that have been destroyed
[2:47:03.220 --> 2:47:07.220]  by Paul Singer, like Greece and the Congo.
[2:47:07.220 --> 2:47:12.220]  What's happened is, is that Citibank and JP Morgan complained to Obama and the United
[2:47:12.220 --> 2:47:13.220]  Bank of Switzerland.
[2:47:13.220 --> 2:47:17.220]  Obama was golfing with the head of United Bank of Switzerland in America.
[2:47:17.220 --> 2:47:20.220]  UBS has a lot more influence than you do, Alex.
[2:47:20.220 --> 2:47:21.220]  I'm sorry to say.
[2:47:21.220 --> 2:47:24.220]  UBS said to Obama, this stuff's got to stop.
[2:47:24.220 --> 2:47:28.220]  So Obama went into federal court with Hillary Clinton.
[2:47:28.220 --> 2:47:30.220]  No one has followed this at all.
[2:47:30.220 --> 2:47:32.220]  It's like done very much in the dark.
[2:47:32.220 --> 2:47:35.220]  And they said, we want Paul the Vulture Singer put out of business.
[2:47:35.220 --> 2:47:40.220]  And there's this provision of the United States Constitution, which allows the president solely
[2:47:40.220 --> 2:47:47.220]  with the agreement to the secretary of state to stop legal actions by any member of the,
[2:47:47.220 --> 2:47:49.220]  any American citizens.
[2:47:49.220 --> 2:47:53.220]  And they said, okay, Singer is putting all the banks of America at risk is putting the
[2:47:53.220 --> 2:47:55.220]  foreign policy of America at risk.
[2:47:55.220 --> 2:47:57.220]  He got to put him out of business.
[2:47:57.220 --> 2:48:01.220]  Well, Singer, Singer's reaction was very simple.
[2:48:01.220 --> 2:48:03.220]  Okay, Mr. Obama, you want to put me out of business?
[2:48:03.220 --> 2:48:04.220]  I put you out of business.
[2:48:04.220 --> 2:48:10.220]  Suddenly, singers lined up 37 count them 37 billionaires organization calls restore our
[2:48:10.220 --> 2:48:15.220]  future to suddenly back Mitt Romney, a guy by the way, he wouldn't spit on last year.
[2:48:15.220 --> 2:48:21.220]  He can't stand Romney Singer, but now Romney's got to be his boy to carry his water to
[2:48:21.220 --> 2:48:23.220]  reverse either.
[2:48:23.220 --> 2:48:25.220]  Well, here's my question.
[2:48:25.220 --> 2:48:27.220]  What are these bankers in globalist fighting with each other?
[2:48:27.220 --> 2:48:29.220]  Think they're going to do when they wreck everything.
[2:48:29.220 --> 2:48:33.220]  I know they've created this agenda 21 system where they think they're just going to consolidate,
[2:48:33.220 --> 2:48:36.220]  you know, things and use the crisis to take over as they've done in third world countries.
[2:48:36.220 --> 2:48:41.220]  But people now know that they're running the puppets as a big number sense.
[2:48:41.220 --> 2:48:45.220]  He has written in his book this year and three years ago pointed out that the people are
[2:48:45.220 --> 2:48:49.220]  actually now aware of the puppetry to a great extent.
[2:48:49.220 --> 2:48:51.220]  And so that the elite is in trouble.
[2:48:51.220 --> 2:48:55.220]  But then I see people like John Corzine, you know, billions disappear.
[2:48:55.220 --> 2:48:58.220]  He lies to Congress, gets caught, doesn't get in trouble.
[2:48:58.220 --> 2:49:02.220]  Then the reports are, you know, he's getting the money for J.P. Morgan.
[2:49:02.220 --> 2:49:04.220]  I mean, these guys are getting more and more reckless.
[2:49:04.220 --> 2:49:08.220]  What are they doing making 40 to one bets with other people's money?
[2:49:08.220 --> 2:49:15.220]  I mean, am I wrong in saying the recklessness is coming to a head in even on a already bravada filled
[2:49:15.220 --> 2:49:21.220]  Hutzpah driven group of wild men?
[2:49:21.220 --> 2:49:24.220]  Well, that's the good guys.
[2:49:24.220 --> 2:49:27.220]  Really wild men.
[2:49:27.220 --> 2:49:35.220]  J.P. Morgan, for example, you know, and when I heard our president say that after J.P. Morgan got caught,
[2:49:35.220 --> 2:49:41.220]  by the way, breaking the law, the new law prevents J.P. Morgan from losing that $10 billion that they lost.
[2:49:41.220 --> 2:49:43.220]  Number one, it's our money, right?
[2:49:43.220 --> 2:49:45.220]  That's tart money.
[2:49:45.220 --> 2:49:54.220]  They took our public money and they went to the casinos in Europe and lost 10 billion, the so-called whale transaction.
[2:49:54.220 --> 2:49:59.220]  So what's happened is that those guys, though, believe it or not, when Obama said,
[2:49:59.220 --> 2:50:03.220]  gee, I wish every bank had a manager like Jamie Dimon.
[2:50:03.220 --> 2:50:10.220]  Well, if we did, we'd all be having to eat our dogs if every bank had a manager like Jamie Dimon.
[2:50:10.220 --> 2:50:15.220]  And you even once said, why should we punish Jamie Dimon?
[2:50:15.220 --> 2:50:20.220]  Mr. President, if you don't know why I have to punish Jamie Dimon, you shouldn't be in the Oval Office.
[2:50:20.220 --> 2:50:24.220]  But that's the thing is that they're also reckless, so they're one-upping each other.
[2:50:24.220 --> 2:50:26.220]  I mean, is there any end to what they'll do?
[2:50:26.220 --> 2:50:27.220]  Yes.
[2:50:27.220 --> 2:50:28.220]  Now, that's what happened.
[2:50:28.220 --> 2:50:35.220]  Even J.P. Morgan went to Obama with UBS City Bank and Bank of America and said these other guys,
[2:50:35.220 --> 2:50:41.220]  these ultra-crazy billionaires, are going to bring us all down unless you do something.
[2:50:41.220 --> 2:50:43.220]  So do you think J.P. Morgan's crazy?
[2:50:43.220 --> 2:50:47.220]  These guys make them look like bankers or the movie version.
[2:50:47.220 --> 2:50:48.220]  I want to hear the details of this.
[2:50:48.220 --> 2:50:50.220]  You've got all the documents as well.
[2:50:50.220 --> 2:50:53.220]  You've got a big article out today in the nation.
[2:50:53.220 --> 2:50:55.220]  Mitt Romney's bailout bonanza.
[2:50:55.220 --> 2:50:58.220]  We're going to look at some of that straight ahead.
[2:50:58.220 --> 2:50:59.220]  Your calls are coming up too.
[2:50:59.220 --> 2:51:00.220]  Stay with us.
[2:51:00.220 --> 2:51:06.220]  For more than six years, I've talked on the air about creating a social network.
[2:51:06.220 --> 2:51:09.220]  PlanetInfoWars.com is in its beta phase.
[2:51:09.220 --> 2:51:10.220]  We're just launching it.
[2:51:10.220 --> 2:51:14.220]  And I want to invite all of you out there to be in on the ground level.
[2:51:14.220 --> 2:51:20.220]  Planet InfoWars is about people coming together, forming activist organizations,
[2:51:20.220 --> 2:51:24.220]  getting involved politically, hunting and fishing, gardening, dating.
[2:51:24.220 --> 2:51:31.220]  This is a place for people who love freedom to meet and to talk and to write and to post information.
[2:51:31.220 --> 2:51:33.220]  And I give you this pledge.
[2:51:33.220 --> 2:51:37.220]  We are not going to spy on you and sell your data to the New World Order.
[2:51:37.220 --> 2:51:42.220]  PlanetInfoWars.com is free, so people who love freedom can get together.

[2:51:51.220 --> 2:51:55.220]  Because resistance is victory. You are victory.
[2:51:55.220 --> 2:51:58.220]  It's waiting for you to breathe power into it.
[2:51:58.220 --> 2:52:27.220]  PlanetInfoWars.com.
[2:52:29.220 --> 2:52:31.220]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[2:52:31.220 --> 2:52:36.220]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[2:52:36.220 --> 2:52:42.220]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[2:52:42.220 --> 2:52:45.220]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[2:52:45.220 --> 2:52:50.220]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[2:52:50.220 --> 2:52:56.220]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns, call 800-686-2237.
[2:52:56.220 --> 2:53:01.220]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[2:53:01.220 --> 2:53:09.220]  I don't mean to be nosy, but do you have the 37 food items you can't get in the coming disaster and may not survive without?
[2:53:09.220 --> 2:53:14.220]  As you already know, something big is about to hit the US and you have got to be prepared.
[2:53:14.220 --> 2:53:18.220]  Did you know that your local grocery store only keeps a three-day supply of food on hand?
[2:53:18.220 --> 2:53:23.220]  So if there's any interruption in our fragile food supply chain or even a hint of a crisis,
[2:53:23.220 --> 2:53:30.220]  then the three-day supply at your local grocery store will be gobbled up by the mob in minutes and you and your family could be in serious trouble.
[2:53:30.220 --> 2:53:41.220]  That's why my friend just created a free video at 37items.com that reveals the 37 critical items you should hoard now before it's too late.
[2:53:41.220 --> 2:53:50.220]  Go watch the important video at 37items.com to discover the 37 things you can't buy after a disaster and may not survive without.
[2:53:50.220 --> 2:53:56.220]  I'm not sure how long the video will be online, so go to 37items.com before it's gone forever.
[2:53:56.220 --> 2:54:21.220]  Again, that's 37items.com.
[2:54:27.220 --> 2:54:30.220]  Welcome back to the Infowars Money Bomb.

[2:55:38.220 --> 2:55:42.220]  So be sure and check that out. I want to thank all those who have donated.
[2:55:42.220 --> 2:55:49.220]  Again, we do this once a year, and it's the opposite of the government taking your money and then using it against you in media propaganda.
[2:55:49.220 --> 2:56:00.220]  This is where you voluntarily do it. And again, we have free video feeds up there at InfowarsMoneyBomb.com as well.
[2:56:00.220 --> 2:56:05.220]  Okay, let's go back to Greg Pallas. Greg, we've got a brief segment here now.
[2:56:05.220 --> 2:56:14.220]  Getting into this, yeah, I've seen these reports, a few of them in the news about this fight and about Obama going after these hedge fund people.
[2:56:14.220 --> 2:56:17.220]  Where do you expect this fight to go now?
[2:56:17.220 --> 2:56:24.220]  We lose, Alex. That's why I do hope, by the way, I know you're not asking me to do this. Please help keep Alex on the air.
[2:56:24.220 --> 2:56:31.220]  Where else are you going to get my reports, man? You think that the big boys are going to let me talk about what's in their underpants?
[2:56:31.220 --> 2:56:39.220]  That ain't happening. Okay, so that's my free commercial for you, Alex. You need this outlet. I just don't know where else.
[2:56:39.220 --> 2:56:44.220]  I mean, I'm on the nightly news in the rest of the world in America. If I don't have Alex, I'm not on, guys.
[2:56:44.220 --> 2:56:49.220]  Well, we always love having you. To be clear, we'll still be on the air if we don't reach our goal.
[2:56:49.220 --> 2:56:55.220]  We just won't be able to expand and get on the air with people that have never heard us worldwide with free to air.
[2:56:55.220 --> 2:57:01.220]  That costs a lot of money and it will reach people. See, our goal is reaching people. It's not just making money.
[2:57:01.220 --> 2:57:07.220]  It's not bad to want to make money as long as it's done morally. It's just that we really want to be able to reach more people.
[2:57:07.220 --> 2:57:10.220]  Let's talk about immoral money then.
[2:57:10.220 --> 2:57:18.220]  My biggest fear is that these guys are going to kiss and make up the banking establishment and the billionaire sharks speculators.
[2:57:18.220 --> 2:57:21.220]  That's my great fear that they're actually going to make up.
[2:57:21.220 --> 2:57:28.220]  But anyway, at the moment, Paul the vulture singer, so he's in war with Obama and his banker buddies.
[2:57:28.220 --> 2:57:35.220]  So what he did was he and two other vulture fund operators, a guy named Dan Loeb.
[2:57:35.220 --> 2:57:40.220]  And by the way, Dan Loeb was Obama's biggest billionaire backer in the last election.
[2:57:40.220 --> 2:57:46.220]  Now he's just given a million to Romney. Like I say, these guys don't have politics. They're not partisan.
[2:57:46.220 --> 2:57:51.220]  They have profits, not political parties, Alex.
[2:57:51.220 --> 2:58:00.220]  So these three billionaires, Loeb, singer the vulture, as he's known, and John Paulson, they bought Delphi Company.
[2:58:00.220 --> 2:58:09.220]  Now what is Delphi? Delphi is the old GM Delco auto parts unit. It used to make most of the parts for GM.
[2:58:09.220 --> 2:58:22.220]  It went into bankruptcy ahead of GM. These guys bought up the entire auto parts division of General Motors for 67 cents a share through an extraordinary flimflam.
[2:58:22.220 --> 2:58:34.220]  But just let me know that they got it for 67 cents a share. They sold it. They flipped it back for $22 a share because they got $12 billion from tarp.
[2:58:34.220 --> 2:58:40.220]  Stay there. Back in 60 seconds with Greg Palace and your phone calls and more.
