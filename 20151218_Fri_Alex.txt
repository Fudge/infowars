[01:45.560 --> 01:49.460]  are the words for what's going on on every front incredible technological
[01:49.460 --> 01:53.320]  developments incredible discoveries every day of earth-like planets very
[01:53.320 --> 01:57.320]  close to us and bionic eyes that see almost as good as a human eye giving
[01:57.320 --> 02:03.440]  sight to the blind just fabulous good stuff happening while criminals in the
[02:03.440 --> 02:07.680]  criminal psycho class who enjoy dominating and screwing people over who
[02:07.680 --> 02:12.880]  were in competition against competition and against 11 a level playing field
[02:12.880 --> 02:18.800]  they are waging war against the free market they are looting our countries
[02:18.800 --> 02:23.680]  to the ground to consolidate power and hoard it all for themselves they can't
[02:23.680 --> 02:27.320]  stand that there's competition in media they can't stand there's competition in
[02:27.320 --> 02:33.120]  ideas because they lose on that playing field they are sore loser failures they
[02:33.120 --> 02:39.200]  are monopoly men and women big broadcast today we're gonna go to break in a
[02:39.200 --> 02:41.840]  moment but first we'll talk to Paul Watson about some of what he's gonna be
[02:41.840 --> 02:49.720]  covering but this house easily approves 1.1 trillion funding bill 316 113
[02:49.720 --> 02:54.320]  rush limbaugh calls it the Republicans selling the American people down the
[02:54.320 --> 02:59.360]  river that's absolutely accurate the FBI's arrested more for Islamic State
[02:59.360 --> 03:05.120]  planned mass casually attacks on rush hour traffic and on colleges in
[03:05.120 --> 03:09.000]  California and Obama comes out with a holiday speech saying there's no
[03:09.000 --> 03:14.080]  credible terror threat he said that a few days before San Bernardino so
[03:14.080 --> 03:17.040]  normally what he says is the exact opposite it's what the devil does he
[03:17.040 --> 03:21.160]  lies you didn't build your business two plus two equals five raising the debt
[03:21.160 --> 03:24.280]  doesn't raise the debt we're not coming for your guns but we're gonna ban them
[03:24.280 --> 03:30.120]  this is a war against reality to condition you to accept total fraud and
[03:30.120 --> 03:34.960]  so Paul Watson this and a lot more today Paul Ryan builds a big fence around his
[03:34.960 --> 03:40.080]  house his big mansion gorging off taxpayer money and insider deals but he
[03:40.080 --> 03:44.880]  won't let America even have a basic border patrol he's involved in massive
[03:44.880 --> 03:49.640]  amnesty through this spending bill and gonna bring in more ISIS and al-Qaeda
[03:49.640 --> 03:53.840]  people in the refugee stream I mean with people like Paul Ryan who needs Hillary
[03:53.840 --> 04:00.040]  Clinton Paul Watson well I mean the term conservative cook hold came out a few
[04:00.040 --> 04:03.520]  months ago and that describes it perfectly but as he said at the start of
[04:03.520 --> 04:07.720]  the show I mean this year has been the most tumultuous in terms of news stories
[04:07.720 --> 04:12.040]  that I can ever remember you know he's talking about Charlie Hebdo the rise of
[04:12.040 --> 04:16.840]  Trump the migrant crisis the Paris attacks I mean it's been momentous in so
[04:16.840 --> 04:21.360]  many ways and it continues to be that way right up until the end of the year so
[04:21.360 --> 04:25.480]  just the stories that we've covered recently are monumental and they're
[04:25.480 --> 04:30.080]  still flooding in that's right and what's really scary is that in full wars
[04:30.080 --> 04:33.400]  with your great work and drudge magnifying what we're doing and so many
[04:33.400 --> 04:38.320]  others is just devastating globalist everywhere and man they are sending their
[04:38.320 --> 04:44.320]  enemies in out of the woodwork which is great we expect full frontal attacks
[04:44.320 --> 04:48.480]  both on the ground here locally we're fully aware of those operations and
[04:48.480 --> 04:53.320]  from the central occupied government but believe me folks we are in the thick of
[04:53.320 --> 04:57.000]  battle Paul Watson stay there we'll be back
[04:57.000 --> 05:03.280]  gonna list and he's checking it twice he's gonna find out who's that's right
[05:03.280 --> 05:08.800]  the feds are coming to town the FAA has just sent their dictate throughout the
[05:08.800 --> 05:14.200]  land any motorized planes heavier than a half pound I repeat a half pound will
[05:14.200 --> 05:18.600]  have to be registered by December 21st if Santa gives you one you can't fly it
[05:18.600 --> 05:23.320]  outside without registering it on their list fail to do so and the FAA will find
[05:23.320 --> 05:29.640]  you $27,500 without due process calling it a civil fine if they come after you
[05:29.640 --> 05:34.040]  criminally quarter of a million dollars and three years in jail for not
[05:34.040 --> 05:37.600]  registering your half pound and heavier plane this regulation won't do
[05:37.600 --> 05:41.520]  anything to enforce the current prohibitions of flying close to airports
[05:41.520 --> 05:45.080]  and they should be concerned if they can't protect airports from toy planes
[05:45.080 --> 05:49.200]  because that means they certainly can't protect airports from shoulder-fired
[05:49.200 --> 05:54.120]  missiles and guess what the jihadis won't be registering those with the FAA
[05:54.120 --> 05:57.640]  for worse.com I'm David Knight

[08:07.800 --> 08:13.800]  lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way
[08:13.800 --> 08:23.800]  in defense of human liberty Alex Jones that's right all the bad things that
[08:23.800 --> 08:27.800]  have happened to me in my life only made me stronger all the vicious horrible
[08:27.800 --> 08:34.200]  things our enemies do only makes us that much better than I thank God for all
[08:34.200 --> 08:40.760]  those blessings always taking us through it well we've got the Donald Trump
[08:40.760 --> 08:45.520]  pinata here the Democrats have been around the country holding birthday
[08:45.520 --> 08:49.240]  parties and things where they scream death to the racist and children that
[08:49.240 --> 08:53.600]  beat up Donald Trump pinatas so I ordered one online it turns out they're very
[08:53.600 --> 08:58.600]  popular item and I guess I'm gonna pull some stunt with it I'm not exactly sure
[08:58.600 --> 09:03.400]  what we're gonna do but it's gonna happen here in the next few days it'll be
[09:03.400 --> 09:08.800]  up on info wars.com or prisonplanet.com perhaps we should go out and do a
[09:08.800 --> 09:13.720]  person on the street and ask folks if they think that Donald Trump should be
[09:13.720 --> 09:18.440]  beaten and see if they'd like to beat him there on the side of the street maybe
[09:18.440 --> 09:22.040]  we'll have a long pole and hang Donald Trump the pinata out there so they can
[09:22.040 --> 09:26.160]  hit it and kind of parrot the mainstream media and then we can actually talk
[09:26.160 --> 09:32.560]  about some of Donald Trump's real policies with them and find out why they
[09:32.560 --> 09:37.080]  want to suicide this republic and why they take some of his statements that
[09:37.080 --> 09:44.280]  are pretty mild and get so vitriolic about it so we are gonna be actually
[09:44.280 --> 09:48.480]  interviewing the pinata here in the next few days not as good as the real
[09:48.480 --> 09:52.320]  Trump that joined us a few weeks ago and I'm told we'll be joining us again in
[09:52.320 --> 09:56.640]  the new year and I'm gonna stop right there and tell you that in the new year
[09:56.640 --> 10:01.560]  I'm gonna be traveling to a major US city to interview someone and this
[10:01.560 --> 10:05.840]  interview will probably be as big as the Trump interview now what other
[10:05.840 --> 10:12.760]  interviews could be that big not Rand Paul not Ted Cruz who else could be as
[10:12.760 --> 10:18.120]  big as the Trump interview or as big as the Matt Drudge interview hmm riddle me
[10:18.120 --> 10:24.760]  this Batman and so that is coming up and of course I'll be doing it in person
[10:24.760 --> 10:30.920]  in person I've been invited into their home through the interview and I really
[10:30.920 --> 10:35.800]  look forward to it and it's gonna be groundbreaking and very very important so
[10:35.800 --> 10:41.000]  you know that I kind of sneak up big interviews on people generally I didn't
[10:41.000 --> 10:47.080]  tell you Trump was coming on even though I knew a week before he was and who
[10:47.080 --> 10:50.200]  knows there might be another Trump interview too soon but that's not the
[10:50.200 --> 10:55.480]  big event it's not a second Trump interview though a second Trump interview
[10:55.480 --> 11:03.240]  is in the works and again it's what it signifies that Trump knows the mainstream
[11:03.240 --> 11:06.840]  media is gonna demonize him coming on the show so he does it to show them how
[11:06.840 --> 11:13.720]  irrelevant and pathetic and snot knows they are now that said obviously the big
[11:13.720 --> 11:21.240]  news today is extremely extremely important because out of all of the
[11:21.240 --> 11:27.600]  stories I have there is one in particular that's up on info wars.com and
[11:27.600 --> 11:31.360]  there's a video of this and I don't want to steal his thunder because he's gonna
[11:31.360 --> 11:35.400]  be covering in here in just a moment and hosting the broadcast today Paul Joseph
[11:35.400 --> 11:41.360]  Watson video this is a this is a Rosetta Stone story there are so many
[11:41.360 --> 11:45.440]  stories that we point at that if you understand this story you understand the
[11:45.440 --> 11:51.480]  whole agenda through this keyhole you can see a great universe on the other
[11:51.480 --> 11:59.640]  side video Canadian children seeing Muhammad worship song Prime Minister
[11:59.640 --> 12:05.960]  tweets approval song inspired by Muhammad's return to Medina after he
[12:05.960 --> 12:10.640]  forced Christians to convert to Islam but also killed thousands by chopping
[12:10.640 --> 12:16.800]  their heads off and it's a Christmas Carol group with the government and they
[12:16.800 --> 12:24.400]  have the Christians invite the quote refugees in
[12:24.400 --> 12:30.560]  1.2 million views 11,000 thumbs up the Prime Minister the new elected
[12:30.560 --> 12:34.840]  Prime Minister praising it as the little Christian children in the big
[12:34.840 --> 12:39.160]  state-run TV productions that aren't Christmas carols anymore it is we
[12:39.160 --> 12:43.440]  celebrate you Muhammad chop the Christians head off let the blood spew
[12:43.440 --> 12:52.760]  oh we love you welcome but in Islamic Arabic and the song is inspired from
[12:52.760 --> 13:01.400]  another song itself from the Korean and of course I'm all open-minded I agree my
[13:01.400 --> 13:06.040]  head should be chopped off please and you know make my family my girls wear
[13:06.040 --> 13:11.680]  headdresses and all these other horrible things no I don't agree with that oh I'm
[13:11.680 --> 13:15.040]  being hateful because I'm not just supposed to be tolerant I'm supposed to
[13:15.040 --> 13:19.080]  adopt the most radical allies of socialists everywhere in fact Paul
[13:19.080 --> 13:21.960]  Watson on a story a few weeks ago he's doing another one where ISIS admits in
[13:21.960 --> 13:26.000]  their official publication that they're recruiting leftist ideologues and
[13:26.000 --> 13:33.280]  students so-called intellectuals sickoid freaks and I was talking to Paul
[13:33.280 --> 13:40.800]  Watson last night and he said you know a lot of what you'd call the conspiracy
[13:40.800 --> 13:47.560]  culture people are it's a minority of them but but some are saying you know
[13:47.560 --> 13:51.200]  Alex Jones because it's always fun to be able to shoot at Alex Jones because you
[13:51.200 --> 13:57.200]  can do that it makes you a bigger man or a bigger woman Alex Jones he's promoted
[13:57.200 --> 14:03.960]  the clash of civilizations and Alex Jones is bad and Alex Jones wants to kill
[14:03.960 --> 14:09.400]  all the Arabs and the Muslims that's like saying if I'm against shooting cops
[14:09.400 --> 14:13.920]  in the back of the head when they pump gas or change attire that I'm for police
[14:13.920 --> 14:20.400]  brutality no I'm not for George Soros funding a diseased revolution in this
[14:20.400 --> 14:24.240]  country of leftist to burn down every major city and have the feds come in
[14:24.240 --> 14:28.040]  and federalize the police and then prosecute free speech and environmental
[14:28.040 --> 14:31.680]  crimes and all their other plans for the future to fill the prisons with
[14:31.680 --> 14:37.560]  patriots and law-abiding citizens I stand against globalist plans globalist
[14:37.560 --> 14:43.600]  programs what the globalist push what they stand for what they do so if they
[14:43.600 --> 14:50.400]  want me to hate the police and go out and have federally run UN run strong
[14:50.400 --> 14:55.160]  cities initiatives takeovers of the police I'm against it if they want me
[14:55.160 --> 14:57.800]  to turn my guns and I'm against it if they want open borders I'm against it
[14:57.800 --> 15:01.760]  then I can intellectually also show you why that's a smart case the globalist
[15:01.760 --> 15:07.160]  want open borders the globalist want to bring in millions of people that invaded
[15:07.160 --> 15:13.000]  Syria to take it over and now failed and they want to bring them here when large
[15:13.000 --> 15:18.640]  portions are ISIS al-Nusra al-Qaeda fighters on record who will attack
[15:18.640 --> 15:22.120]  ISIS put out a statement yesterday saying we have sleeper cells everywhere and
[15:22.120 --> 15:28.600]  a blitzkrieg is about to begin that's their word a blitzkrieg a lightning
[15:28.600 --> 15:33.600]  war and at the end of it the criminal globalists will take all of our rights
[15:33.600 --> 15:38.840]  expand the police state surveil everyone but still keep the borders wide open so
[15:38.840 --> 15:45.200]  I'm against bringing these people in so they can attack us and I'm also pointing
[15:45.200 --> 15:51.400]  out we have to jump through all these political hoops to be able to
[15:51.840 --> 15:56.440]  supposedly be safe and and wave all our rights but then when it comes to actually
[15:56.440 --> 16:00.040]  shipping people in from Mexico Africa the Middle East wherever they don't even
[16:00.040 --> 16:03.520]  look at their passports or IDs that's in the news they just say come on in and
[16:03.520 --> 16:07.200]  every day it's in the news where they disappear by the thousands in Texas and
[16:07.200 --> 16:11.440]  Louisiana and New York California and the feds go we're gonna tell the police
[16:11.440 --> 16:15.880]  even what their names are they're just free to do whatever but I almost got a
[16:15.880 --> 16:20.240]  proctology exam the last time I flew in from a four-day trip to Cancun with my
[16:20.240 --> 16:27.760]  kids one of these people didn't like me knew who I was said go in the back and
[16:27.760 --> 16:30.360]  then a senior guy came in and said look we know you're not smell anything Alex
[16:30.360 --> 16:34.160]  you can go but we apologize I said we don't need to apologize I kind of got mad
[16:34.160 --> 16:38.880]  to I'm sorry the point was is that this is a joke then there was the grape jelly
[16:38.880 --> 16:42.720]  thing I was at a farmers market in Omaha bought some grape jelly for my mom
[16:42.720 --> 16:48.360]  and they flipped out and said next time you'll be charged I almost missed my
[16:48.360 --> 16:53.480]  flight they interrogated me for 45 minutes about the grape jelly why'd you
[16:53.480 --> 16:56.480]  bring it why'd you commit the crime trying to set me up and I said I just
[16:56.480 --> 16:59.240]  didn't think about it I still thought I was in a free country sorry about the
[16:59.240 --> 17:04.360]  grape jelly but see the globalists want the open borders they want to bring
[17:04.360 --> 17:09.880]  these people in I am against it but see people that criticize us don't really
[17:09.880 --> 17:13.480]  want to save the country or have a free world or a future they just want to
[17:13.480 --> 17:17.760]  feel like they are intellectually superior so let me wave a magic wand for
[17:17.760 --> 17:24.960]  you sparkle noise bling you are superior to me you're smarter than me you're
[17:24.960 --> 17:28.920]  better than me you're harder working than me you could beat me up I'm a wimp
[17:28.920 --> 17:35.360]  you've got the answer so you go out there all of you on the message board on

[18:47.760 --> 18:52.440]  but you can still support the liberty movement and make choices where you can
[18:52.440 --> 18:57.320]  to build up local communities to build up local farmers to buy American and to
[18:57.320 --> 19:03.800]  do what you can to expose the globalist operations so I'm gonna just punch out

[19:38.680 --> 19:42.920]  us and lying about us and saying things I didn't say that there's big wasp under
[19:42.920 --> 19:46.680]  the Capitol building or under the UN and that we didn't moon land and that you

[23:03.240 --> 23:07.720]  government are struggling against an inevitable crisis but they're about to
[23:07.720 --> 23:13.440]  lose control when this happens it will rip our country apart in ways you never
[23:13.440 --> 23:18.000]  imagined from where we shop to the doctors you visit and the family you
[23:18.000 --> 23:22.280]  want to protect look I've made predictions like this before a few years ago I
[23:22.280 --> 23:26.680]  warned that the housing prices would collapse before that I warned that dot
[23:26.680 --> 23:31.760]  com companies would crash and they did those who listened had a chance to save
[23:31.760 --> 23:36.120]  themselves but this has nothing to do with the stock market this will affect
[23:36.120 --> 23:42.880]  us all I've posted a free video at dollardanger.com maybe you'll disagree
[23:42.880 --> 23:47.680]  with my conclusions but first you need to watch this video and see the facts for

[24:03.120 --> 24:09.120]  In 1814 we took a little trip along the Mississippi to the mighty
[24:09.120 --> 24:13.120]  In 1814 we took a little trip along the Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi
[24:13.120 --> 24:17.120]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody bridge
[24:17.120 --> 24:19.120]  I didn't intend to put up over music coming in there
[24:19.120 --> 24:24.960]  Paul Watson actually can't stand the clean and all the rest of it you know more
[24:24.960 --> 24:28.840]  than half people in the UK back then England were against the Revolutionary
[24:28.840 --> 24:31.840]  War in this country and that's why we had so much support in England and after a
[24:31.840 --> 24:35.160]  six-year war they finally had put so much pressure that's why the king back
[24:35.160 --> 24:39.120]  down and sued for peace so that's a good thing you know that's where our
[24:39.120 --> 24:43.720]  freedoms first began to be recognized and focused on they didn't come from that
[24:43.720 --> 24:49.600]  but but people began to point to them was in Runnymede in 1215 and Lord
[24:49.600 --> 24:53.320]  Moncton was on yesterday and said Prince Charles better think about other
[24:53.320 --> 24:57.360]  princes and kings that have had their heads cut off including his ancestor
[24:57.360 --> 25:02.320]  Charles the first if he continues to engage in treason against the UK pretty
[25:02.320 --> 25:06.160]  bold statement from Lord Moncton never heard him talk like that we ought to get
[25:06.160 --> 25:08.720]  Paul's take on that later Paul I'm gonna hand the baton to you I know you were
[25:08.720 --> 25:11.360]  supposed to be hosting today I appreciate you doing it but I'm up here
[25:11.360 --> 25:14.360]  you know obviously doing bookkeeping work working on the TV network and just
[25:14.360 --> 25:18.920]  couldn't get drug away from the microphone appreciate all the intel and
[25:18.920 --> 25:23.160]  stuff you've got coming up today and I'll be back some for part of the second
[25:23.160 --> 25:27.600]  hour and we were working on some other special reports but just to finish up
[25:27.600 --> 25:32.320]  I'll talk about classes civilizations for those that don't know Dick Cheney and
[25:32.320 --> 25:38.160]  others wrote the PNAC report back in 2000 will go destabilize the Middle East
[25:38.160 --> 25:46.960]  will engage in all these different activities and then we will use the
[25:46.960 --> 25:51.040]  crises out of destabilized Middle East to go in and take it over and then we'll
[25:51.040 --> 25:55.040]  use the continuing threat to take everybody's rights here in America well
[25:55.040 --> 25:59.000]  people then say well that's what they're doing exactly so we're opposing their
[25:59.000 --> 26:06.920]  war to invade their war to destabilize their war to do all of this and then we
[26:06.920 --> 26:10.440]  failed at that so now we're opposing their next phase to flood us with all
[26:10.440 --> 26:15.480]  these third world jihadis see how that works we're opposing the globalist plan
[26:15.480 --> 26:19.120]  every step of the way but people aren't sophisticated enough to get that since
[26:19.120 --> 26:23.400]  the globalist destabilized the Middle East put radicals in we're now supposed
[26:23.400 --> 26:27.400]  to accept their next phase of the plan and bring them in here to complete that
[26:27.400 --> 26:32.360]  phase Paul that makes no sense why can't people be sophisticated enough to
[26:32.360 --> 26:36.120]  understand if the globalist want to bring all these jihadis in it might not
[26:36.120 --> 26:40.640]  be a good idea I mean we oppose the wars we expose the false flag we oppose
[26:40.640 --> 26:45.400]  going in we tried to stop it we failed now we're trying to stop the next phase
[26:45.400 --> 26:50.000]  we have a chance of stopping it I mean where is the logic out there Paul you've
[26:50.000 --> 26:54.600]  got the floor I'll see you next hour well it's again it's the ability
[26:54.600 --> 26:59.800]  for people to hold more than one thought in their head at one time so if you
[26:59.800 --> 27:03.760]  criticize the wave of immigrants who aren't integrated into our culture who
[27:03.760 --> 27:09.400]  are already caught causing crime waves rape epidemics then that also means for
[27:09.400 --> 27:14.080]  some reason that your pro-empire your pro-military intervention when that's
[27:14.080 --> 27:19.040]  partly what caused the refugee problem in the first place so again some people
[27:19.040 --> 27:22.680]  think there's some grand narrative behind info wars that were pushing some
[27:22.680 --> 27:27.640]  grand conspiracy when we're simply covering the news cycle like people say
[27:27.640 --> 27:30.760]  to me you know why are you so obsessed with feminists why are you always
[27:30.760 --> 27:34.720]  talking about feminists why you always talking about black lives matter why
[27:34.720 --> 27:38.720]  you always talking about Trump I'm talking about the news cycle that's
[27:38.720 --> 27:43.120]  how it works so obviously with the current refugee crisis and the Paris
[27:43.120 --> 27:48.720]  massacre we're talking about Muslim migration we're talking about jihadist
[27:48.720 --> 27:52.200]  and they admit they're gonna use the immigrant waves and excuse to totally
[27:52.200 --> 27:57.520]  invade the Middle East destabilize it more set up an EU army over the people
[27:57.520 --> 28:01.320]  and suppress the citizens it's so obvious well how are these people so
[28:01.320 --> 28:06.080]  stupid and then you look at ISIS themselves that's what they're saying
[28:06.080 --> 28:10.840]  that's what a caliphate is it's an empire they basically want to recreate
[28:10.840 --> 28:15.720]  what Mohammed and the Muslims created before the Christian crusades they want
[28:15.720 --> 28:20.600]  to take role this is just history repeating itself over and over again so
[28:20.600 --> 28:25.040]  so simply draw attention to what they want is not embracing that entire
[28:25.040 --> 28:29.720]  narrative to draw attention to people being raped Muslim women primarily
[28:29.720 --> 28:33.800]  being raped people having their hands chopped off women being stoned to death
[28:33.800 --> 28:38.640]  that's not pushing a clash of civilizations that's pushing classical
[28:38.640 --> 28:43.200]  liberal principles that everybody needs to stand behind if not be called a
[28:43.200 --> 28:47.440]  complete hypocrite which is a big problem at the moment with the regressive
[28:47.440 --> 28:52.360]  left who the moment you mentioned that there might be a problem integrating
[28:52.360 --> 28:57.120]  these people many of whom are illiterate they've got no respect for women they've
[28:57.120 --> 29:01.800]  got no respect for minorities yet we have to adapt to them and to even suggest
[29:01.800 --> 29:06.280]  that that might be an issue which it's already proving to be an issue that
[29:06.280 --> 29:09.960]  means you're a bigot you're an Islamophobe and then you've even got
[29:09.960 --> 29:14.560]  left-wing organizations and I'll get into this more after the break listing as
[29:14.560 --> 29:20.680]  anti-Muslim bigots devout Muslims American Muslims who are campaigning
[29:20.680 --> 29:24.960]  against things like honor killings so these left-wingers these middle-class
[29:24.960 --> 29:29.680]  white liberals are actually putting actual devout Muslims on hate lists
[29:29.680 --> 29:35.240]  because they criticize the intolerant aspect of their own religion it's
[29:35.240 --> 29:39.160]  completely crazy but we can get more into after the break a ton of news and
[29:39.160 --> 29:43.400]  Peter Schiff coming up this is the Friday edition of the Alex Jones show

[33:08.400 --> 33:13.040]  the owners of this country don't want that I'm talking about the real owners
[33:13.040 --> 33:17.760]  now the real owners the big wealthy business interests that control things
[33:17.760 --> 33:21.920]  and make all the important decisions forget the politicians the politicians
[33:21.920 --> 33:27.400]  are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice you don't you
[33:27.400 --> 33:34.280]  have no choice you have owners they own you they own everything they own all the
[33:34.280 --> 33:38.320]  important land they own and control the corporations they've long since bought
[33:38.320 --> 33:41.320]  and paid for the Senate the Congress the state houses and city halls they got the
[33:41.320 --> 33:44.680]  judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies so they
[33:44.680 --> 33:48.440]  control just about all of the news and information you get to hear they got you
[33:48.440 --> 33:56.040]  by the balls they want obedient workers obedient workers people who are just
[33:56.040 --> 33:59.800]  smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork and just dumb enough to
[33:59.800 --> 34:04.200]  passively accept jobs with the lower pay the longer hours to reduce benefits the
[34:04.200 --> 34:07.680]  end of overtime and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to
[34:07.680 --> 34:12.280]  collect it and now they're coming for your social security money so they can
[34:12.280 --> 34:18.320]  give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street it's a big club and you ain't
[34:18.320 --> 34:23.400]  in it and you said recently quote when you give they do whatever the hell you
[34:23.400 --> 34:28.040]  want them to do you better believe it so what specifically didn't they do if I
[34:28.040 --> 34:31.840]  ask them if I need them you know most of the people on this stage I've given to
[34:31.840 --> 34:37.560]  just so you understand a lot of money you and I are not in the big club the
[34:37.560 --> 34:42.120]  owners of this country know the truth it's called the American dream because
[34:42.120 --> 34:47.160]  you have to be asleep to believe it but I'll tell you what they don't want they
[34:47.160 --> 34:50.800]  don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking they don't
[34:50.800 --> 34:54.760]  want well-informed well-educated people capable of critical thinking they're not
[34:54.760 --> 34:58.440]  interested in that that doesn't help them that's against their interest
[34:58.440 --> 35:07.960]  that's right from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones we are
[35:07.960 --> 35:12.680]  back on the Alex Jones show Friday edition the Dow Jones is currently down
[35:12.680 --> 35:19.200]  about 270 points gold has shot up again of course after this week's Federal
[35:19.200 --> 35:23.520]  Reserve interest rate rise we're gonna have economist Peter Schiff on the show
[35:23.520 --> 35:27.000]  in the third hour to discuss the ramifications of that we're gonna
[35:27.000 --> 35:32.160]  take your calls also later in the show but Alex mentioned it just in the
[35:32.160 --> 35:37.240]  previous segment top story and info wars calm video Canadian children sing
[35:37.240 --> 35:43.600]  Muhammad worship song PM tweets approval video shows Canadian children
[35:43.600 --> 35:47.960]  singing a song in which celebrates Muhammad's arrival in Medina after he
[35:47.960 --> 35:55.280]  forced Christians to convert to Islam under threat of death here's the video
[35:55.280 --> 36:20.720]  so you've got about a hundred or more probably 200 Canadian school children
[36:20.720 --> 36:27.720]  obviously having been told to sing this promo Hamid worship song the composer of
[36:27.720 --> 36:32.480]  this song told the Ottawa citizen this is musician Laura Hawley that it was
[36:32.480 --> 36:38.160]  influenced by a Arabic song a Muslim song called teller al-badru al-nanya and
[36:38.160 --> 36:43.280]  that it blended in elements of that with her original composition so it wasn't
[36:43.280 --> 36:48.840]  that original song but it was inspired by that song and included elements of
[36:48.840 --> 36:54.640]  that song so I actually went and researched where this song came from
[36:54.640 --> 36:58.800]  what inspired that song which again in turn inspired the song being sung by
[36:58.800 --> 37:04.640]  Canadian school children again the Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted out
[37:04.640 --> 37:10.760]  his approval for them singing this song the day after they welcomed 163 Syrian
[37:10.760 --> 37:15.520]  refugees into Canada the composer claims it's got nothing whatsoever to do with
[37:15.520 --> 37:21.120]  that but if you actually research the origins of this song it celebrates the
[37:21.120 --> 37:26.920]  aftermath of the Battle of Tabuk which back in history was an expedition a
[37:26.920 --> 37:32.360]  military expedition or a jihad to what is present-day northwestern Saudi Arabia
[37:32.360 --> 37:39.040]  so basically Muhammad with about 30,000 troops led them to this area to face off
[37:39.040 --> 37:43.840]  with the Byzantine army the Byzantine army were not present when Muhammad
[37:43.840 --> 37:48.920]  arrived so it wasn't really a battle in the true sense of the word but what they
[37:48.920 --> 37:53.480]  did do while they were there in this area which is now Saudi Arabia was force
[37:53.480 --> 38:01.680]  Jews and Christians to convert to Islam under threat of death or pay a jizya
[38:01.680 --> 38:07.480]  which of course is a tax for non-believers the same tax currently
[38:07.480 --> 38:13.680]  being imposed by ISIS on Christians in the Middle East who they basically go
[38:13.680 --> 38:19.280]  to and say you will pay this crippling tax which is you know around 20% of their
[38:19.280 --> 38:25.360]  income or we'll behead you and take your wives as sex slaves so they either have
[38:25.360 --> 38:30.400]  to convert to Islam or pay this humiliating tax that's what this song
[38:30.400 --> 38:35.680]  is about that's what Muhammad did when he went to this area which is now Saudi
[38:35.680 --> 38:41.640]  Arabia went there to fight the Byzantine army they weren't there so his Muslim
[38:41.640 --> 38:48.320]  army simply took over the entire area and forced everyone to convert to Islam
[38:48.320 --> 38:53.000]  and it's actually mentioned in the Quran the Quran refers to the battle by
[38:53.000 --> 38:57.680]  calling on Muslims to fight and kill non-believers until they quote pay the
[38:57.680 --> 39:04.480]  jizya with willing submission and feel themselves subdued the jizya again is a
[39:04.480 --> 39:08.720]  crippling tax which ISIS is now imposing on Christians in the Middle East and
[39:08.720 --> 39:12.920]  then it also refers to a letter in the Quran that Muhammad sent to the
[39:12.920 --> 39:18.560]  Christian Prince Allah threatening him to convert to Islam pay the jizya or be
[39:18.560 --> 39:24.680]  killed so in summary you've got Canadian children 200 of them up there
[39:24.680 --> 39:29.800]  basically singing a song that celebrates the subjugation and submission of
[39:29.800 --> 39:35.080]  Christians to Islam after thousands of Muslims took over a large portion of
[39:35.080 --> 39:40.720]  territory so as I write in the article given that history and given what this
[39:40.720 --> 39:45.440]  song is based on it would perhaps have been less provocative simply to have the
[39:45.440 --> 39:51.000]  children Chan Allah Akbar instead and of course this concern about
[39:51.000 --> 39:57.200]  Islamization of the schools has been a relevant issue in recent weeks we've
[39:57.200 --> 40:02.600]  got a story here out of newsplex.com Augusta County Schools closed due to
[40:02.600 --> 40:07.320]  calligraphy assignment reaction according to a statement from the County
[40:07.320 --> 40:11.280]  Schools Administration it's because numerous phone calls and emails that
[40:11.280 --> 40:15.720]  have been sent to schools in the area following a geography assignment that
[40:15.720 --> 40:21.400]  involves copying Arabic calligraphy but of course the calligraphy that these
[40:21.400 --> 40:26.640]  children at this school were told to copy by their geography teacher was the
[40:26.640 --> 40:32.440]  shahada or the Muslim statement of faith that translates as there is no god but
[40:32.440 --> 40:38.560]  Allah and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah so now you've got a bunch of irate
[40:38.560 --> 40:43.960]  parents complaining to the school that their children were forced to basically
[40:43.960 --> 40:49.360]  tacitly in print convert to become Muslim no doubt they're up in arms about
[40:49.360 --> 40:56.040]  it the school reacted by closing entirely citing threats they say there was no
[40:56.040 --> 41:00.520]  actual physical threat to the students or the teachers but merely the vitriol
[41:00.520 --> 41:06.040]  coming from the parents has forced the school to close today then we have this
[41:06.040 --> 41:11.000]  out CVS Minnesota a couple of days ago parents questioned choice to sing Allah
[41:11.000 --> 41:16.800]  Akbar at holiday concert some parents in the Anoka Hennepin school district the
[41:16.800 --> 41:21.880]  questioning the choir teachers decision to use a song about Ramadan performed in
[41:21.880 --> 41:25.880]  Arabic at a holiday concert or in other words a Christmas concert we can't say
[41:25.880 --> 41:29.520]  that anymore it's not politically correct but Thursday night's concert at
[41:29.520 --> 41:32.840]  Blaine High School one of the song students will be singing includes
[41:32.840 --> 41:37.920]  Arabic words including the phrase Allah Akbar which means God is great and of
[41:37.920 --> 41:42.680]  course is the phrase that terrorists chant and scream right before they murder
[41:42.680 --> 41:48.560]  a massacre innocent people so basically you've got school children across
[41:48.560 --> 41:53.680]  America you've got employees office parties saying you've got people in
[41:53.680 --> 41:58.080]  universities saying don't call it a Christmas party that might offend
[41:58.080 --> 42:03.600]  somebody that's not culturally sensitive don't have red and green holiday
[42:03.600 --> 42:08.000]  decorations might trigger somebody maybe it'll you know upset someone like
[42:08.000 --> 42:13.160]  Saeed Farooq that was apparently one of his triggers before the San Bernardino
[42:13.160 --> 42:19.520]  massacre it might upset the special snowflakes if we dare mention the word
[42:19.520 --> 42:25.600]  Christmas meanwhile it's perfectly fine to have kids you know transcribing
[42:25.600 --> 42:30.360]  calligraphy they're basically converting to become Muslim singing songs about how
[42:30.360 --> 42:37.840]  Allah is great over in Canada singing songs about a Muslim conquest where
[42:37.840 --> 42:42.800]  Jews and Christians were forced to convert to Islam under pain of death
[42:42.800 --> 42:48.680]  that's perfectly acceptable but don't you dare mention the word Christmas so
[42:48.680 --> 42:54.240]  again it's kind of this fusion of the West being forced to adopt to this
[42:54.240 --> 42:59.600]  culture and it might be okay if we could actually celebrate our own culture in
[42:59.600 --> 43:04.000]  the process but we can't do that anymore that's bad that's evil that's
[43:04.000 --> 43:07.560]  politically incorrect and it might upset of somebody you might upset the next
[43:07.560 --> 43:14.800]  Saeed Farooq who might massacre a bunch of people as a result now from Canada one
[43:14.800 --> 43:20.160]  liberal basket case to another we've got this out of Sweden upon info wars.com
[43:20.160 --> 43:24.480]  Sweden's top public broadcaster bans use of the word immigrant
[43:24.480 --> 43:30.880]  Sweden's top public broadcaster SVT and this is their equivalent of the BBC in
[43:30.880 --> 43:35.960]  the United Kingdom which of course is funded by mandatory television license
[43:35.960 --> 43:41.360]  fees where they throw you in a cage if you don't pay it of course the BBC
[43:41.360 --> 43:47.000]  intimately tied to the state so it's the Swedish version of that as ordered
[43:47.000 --> 43:50.640]  employees not to use the word immigrant because it might be seen as
[43:50.640 --> 43:54.400]  politically incorrect it might upset the special snowflake jihadists that are
[43:54.400 --> 43:59.640]  basically taking over Sweden while also prohibiting the terms black and dark
[43:59.640 --> 44:05.800]  skin because they may arouse criticism of terrorists and criminals we don't want
[44:05.800 --> 44:12.800]  to hurt the feelings of terrorists and rapists their special snowflakes that
[44:12.800 --> 44:17.440]  deserve their own safe space we can't offend their feelings so basically they
[44:17.440 --> 44:22.040]  visit you the new language manual sounds like straight something straight
[44:22.040 --> 44:26.480]  out of 1984 which orders the journalist not to say immigrant because it might be
[44:26.480 --> 44:31.520]  offensive to immigrants who have become Swedish citizens when describing
[44:31.520 --> 44:36.440]  terrorists or criminals this is also in the language manual employees have also
[44:36.440 --> 44:41.720]  been told not to use the word black African origin or dark skin again
[44:41.720 --> 44:46.000]  because it may arouse criticism of criminals we don't want to hurt their
[44:46.000 --> 44:51.120]  feelings however using the words white or fair skinned in the same context is
[44:51.120 --> 44:56.560]  perfectly acceptable completely ridiculous but what do you expect out of
[44:56.560 --> 45:01.760]  Sweden I mean this is a country whose expert on Islamophobia went on to join
[45:01.760 --> 45:08.160]  ISIS this is a country whose top bishop calls for removing Christian crosses
[45:08.160 --> 45:14.820]  from churches so as not to upset Muslim migrants who are moving into them what
[45:14.820 --> 45:20.200]  else was in this language guide the guide also mandated that anyone accused of
[45:20.200 --> 45:26.600]  discrimination or racism by immigrants is not given any airtime to defend
[45:26.600 --> 45:33.840]  themselves so again nothing to do with equality taking away the free speech
[45:33.840 --> 45:39.720]  rights of somebody to defend themselves if they've been labeled a racist by an
[45:39.720 --> 45:43.880]  immigrant because now they've got special rights that supersede everybody else in
[45:43.880 --> 45:52.400]  the name of tolerance and progressivism so again Sweden this is a place where
[45:52.400 --> 45:57.480]  their politicians call for their citizens to house migrants in their own
[45:57.480 --> 46:03.960]  garages while the country labors under a housing shortage it's the country where
[46:03.960 --> 46:08.520]  as we reported a couple of weeks ago victims of Muslim gang rapes are
[46:08.520 --> 46:13.080]  unsure about whether to report a crime to police because they fear doing so may
[46:13.080 --> 46:17.880]  offend the perpetrator there's actually a woman who is gang raped on a train in
[46:17.880 --> 46:23.760]  Sweden she was unsure about reporting the crime to the authorities because she
[46:23.760 --> 46:29.360]  thought the precious snowflake rapist might be deported back to his own
[46:29.360 --> 46:36.960]  country God forbid anybody would want that again the people who bring this up
[46:36.960 --> 46:42.640]  in Sweden bearing in mind that it's now the rape capital of the West number two
[46:42.640 --> 46:48.080]  globally for rape in Sweden since they open the doors to mass immigration this
[46:48.080 --> 46:53.720]  is a country that prosecutes prominent politicians merely for drawing a
[46:53.720 --> 47:00.240]  tension to the rape statistics which we've covered before a 1400% increase
[47:00.240 --> 47:08.720]  in rapes in Sweden since the 1970s merely highlighting that fact leads to
[47:08.720 --> 47:14.400]  people being charged with hate crimes in Sweden and again this is why we
[47:14.400 --> 47:18.400]  constantly draw attention to Sweden because if we don't stop this insanity
[47:18.400 --> 47:24.520]  right now in America in Canada in the United Kingdom this is where we're all
[47:24.520 --> 47:29.880]  heading I mean I wrote I put out a video about a week ago saying stoning women to
[47:29.880 --> 47:35.560]  death for being raped is bad beheading people for being gay is bad executing
[47:35.560 --> 47:41.280]  people who leave the religion of Islam is bad I put out that video I was
[47:41.280 --> 47:46.800]  reported to the police for hate speech you can't say that lopping off the heads
[47:46.800 --> 47:51.760]  of homosexual people is bad because it might offend the Muslims therefore its
[47:51.760 --> 47:56.840]  hate speech you can't criticize the religion of Islam because it's racist
[47:56.840 --> 48:01.320]  even though it's not a race and those are the kind of laws that are already on
[48:01.320 --> 48:05.480]  the books in Sweden we've had prominent politicians go to court and be charged
[48:05.480 --> 48:11.160]  with hate crimes simply for talking about crime statistics and the fact that
[48:11.160 --> 48:17.760]  over in over 70% of cases in Sweden rapists are foreign-born immigrants it's
[48:17.760 --> 48:23.960]  just a fact that's the rape culture that they imported into Sweden and anyone
[48:23.960 --> 48:30.480]  who draws attention to that is now treated as a hate criminal again this is
[48:30.480 --> 48:33.720]  what this is our future if we don't stand up to this politically correct
[48:33.720 --> 48:39.920]  insanity so we've got Canadian school children singing songs about how Muhammad
[48:39.920 --> 48:42.880]  you know threatened to chop people's heads off if they didn't convert to
[48:42.880 --> 48:47.000]  Islam it's trendy it's progressive it's liberal then we got this out of
[48:47.000 --> 48:54.000]  WorldNet daily arrested German jihadist Islamic Blitzkrieg coming a detained
[48:54.000 --> 48:58.520]  German terrorist all authorities that chancellor Angela Merkel can expect an
[48:58.520 --> 49:03.920]  Islamic Blitzkrieg from returning fighters of course Merkel Time magazine's
[49:03.920 --> 49:08.760]  Person of the Year after opening the doors to a million in the initial wave
[49:08.760 --> 49:15.120]  immigrants the vast majority of the Muslim now we're seeing actual ISIS
[49:15.120 --> 49:22.520]  jihadists arrested in Germany brazenly asserting proclaiming predicting that
[49:22.520 --> 49:26.320]  these jihadists that Merkel has brought into the country will commit terror
[49:26.320 --> 49:32.520]  attacks just like in Paris where the ringleader the ringleader the mastermind
[49:32.520 --> 49:38.120]  of the Paris massacre bragged about how he was able to travel back and forth
[49:38.120 --> 49:44.080]  between Europe and Syria by exploiting by abusing the refugee program which of
[49:44.080 --> 49:49.280]  course the FBI says that they can't bear these people coming into the United
[49:49.280 --> 49:54.120]  States so now Harry S this is the name of the jihadist said he was twice
[49:54.120 --> 49:57.920]  approached by ISIS members in the spring to conduct terror attacks inside
[49:57.920 --> 50:01.680]  Germany but told them he was not ready he fled Syria in the middle of the night
[50:01.680 --> 50:06.360]  after months of witnessing executions so this is a guy that fought alongside them
[50:06.360 --> 50:11.920]  now he's speaking out against them and that's not all there's another report of
[50:11.920 --> 50:17.480]  somebody arrested in a refugee camp in Germany which we're going to get to but
[50:17.480 --> 50:21.440]  what I wanted to mention is you remember after the Paris massacre we had this

[56:28.840 --> 56:35.040]  ISIS terrorists seized in German refugee camp but I thought they were all orphans
[56:35.040 --> 56:39.240]  and widows I mean that's what President Barack Obama said right you got nothing
[56:39.240 --> 56:42.800]  to worry about they're just orphans and widows well we had one arrested in
[56:42.800 --> 56:48.160]  Netherlands last week another ISIS terrorists we had hundreds of quote
[56:48.160 --> 56:53.000]  refugees found with ISIS flags and beheading videos on their cell phones
[56:53.000 --> 56:58.040]  in Italy again just orphans and widows and now we've got an ISIS terrorist
[56:58.040 --> 57:03.440]  seized in a German refugee camp the Syrian suspected of working with ISIS was
[57:03.440 --> 57:08.920]  apprehended in a refugee camp in Germany Leith de Ham Alderi reportedly known as
[57:08.920 --> 57:13.480]  the paymaster was seized by authorities at refugee camp in the town of
[57:13.480 --> 57:18.880]  honor according to build. Alderi was allegedly working as a terrorist group's
[57:18.880 --> 57:22.600]  accountant was identified by authorities thanks to a photo of him
[57:22.600 --> 57:28.920]  posted online by Syrian anti-ISIS activists so of course you remember
[57:28.920 --> 57:35.320]  during the first wave of the refugee crisis back in September we had these
[57:35.320 --> 57:41.120]  free Syrian army fighters and Al-Nusra fighters coming into German train
[57:41.120 --> 57:45.320]  stations there were comparison pictures posted on Twitter of them with
[57:45.320 --> 57:50.960]  Kalashnikovs and then arriving in Germany people said oh they were fighting for the
[57:50.960 --> 57:54.680]  free Syrian army they're the moderate rebels they're the good guys don't be
[57:54.680 --> 57:59.840]  Islamophobic of course we know that the free Syrian army many of them defected
[57:59.840 --> 58:04.440]  to ISIS many of them gave their weapons to ISIS and many of them did the same
[58:04.440 --> 58:09.600]  with Al-Nusra which is an al Qaeda offshoot so yet more reports of these
[58:09.600 --> 58:15.520]  individuals being found in refugee camps just the other day we had another two
[58:15.520 --> 58:20.360]  suspects in the Paris massacre found in a refugee camp in Austria again
[58:20.360 --> 58:25.800]  highlighting that this is a major threat we're gonna come back after the break
[58:25.800 --> 58:31.160]  though with more news the Obama administration has lost thousands of
[58:31.160 --> 58:34.800]  terrorists that's a huge story right now we'll be back on the Alex Jones show

[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:32.080]  segment in the third hour we're going to talk to peter shiff about the economy
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:37.480]  the dow jones is currently down about 270 points we've got gold surging back up
[01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:41.960]  again and the oil price continues to plummet so we're going to see what peter
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:45.880]  thinks that means for the future of the economy we're also going to talk about
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:50.920]  the shrinking middle class but here's the headline out of progressives today.com
[01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:56.920]  lord of the ring star says terrorists have legitimate complaints about the west
[01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:01.320]  liberal actor ian mckellan recently made some eyebrow raising remarks about
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:06.440]  isis here's the clip i suppose terrorists just want to disrupt our
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:09.880]  lives and make it hell and i think our answer because
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:13.960]  what come on news is to carry on they're very chicken
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:22.280]  terrorists and so extreme in their views and you know that
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:26.600]  i'm sure the the legitimate legitimate complaint that your country and my
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:29.960]  country have meddled in their affairs is a fair one
[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:36.200]  but it doesn't justify this so ian mckellan says that they have legitimate
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:40.360]  complaints and that the west meddling in their countries
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:45.480]  to some extent justifies isis attack so of course this is completely erroneous
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:51.880]  because the very creation the very existence of isis relies on the fact
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:56.280]  that the west meddle in those countries so that was a boon to isis
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:02:00.520]  it wasn't a grievance the pentagon knew that they're meddling
[01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:06.760]  in syria in trying to topple a secular leadership in bashar al-asad would lead
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:11.080]  to the creation in their own words of a salafist principality
[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:16.840]  in other words isis so it's not the the grievance is legitimate that we
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:20.920]  intervened in syria isis owes its very existence
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:25.160]  to the fact that we intervened so they should be pleased with that
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:28.760]  but again it's another one of these we saw after charlie hebdo
[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:32.920]  you know maybe the cartoonists deserve to be slaughtered in cold blood
[01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:37.880]  because they dared offend the precious jihadists we saw it again after the
[01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:41.080]  paris massacre where the cook hold had left
[01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:44.920]  ran about denying again that islamic extremism was a problem
[01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:49.160]  you know hug a muslim and all that and it was just a giant exercise once again
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:53.000]  in virtue signaling they refuse to face up to the
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:57.640]  problem because it transgresses their regressivism
[01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:01.320]  and we saw that again in the uk with this petition to ban
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:05.880]  donald trump people trying to virtue signal
[01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:11.080]  while they're actually endorsing the criminalization of free speech well
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:15.160]  now it emerges out of the express headline it's a fiddle
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:19.560]  petition to ban trump from uk signed multiple times
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:24.760]  by the same people government petitions being abused online by activists
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:28.600]  organizing mass signings to trigger government debates remember
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:33.080]  if these petitions get over a hundred thousand signatures in the uk
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:37.000]  parliament actually debates the issue so whereas most of these petitions are
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:42.120]  useless this one actually has teeth well in a matter of minutes
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:45.560]  reporters from the express were able to sign government petitions
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:49.400]  multiple times using the same name and postcode
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:53.720]  so they're saying this is probably what happened here the trump ban petition was
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:56.520]  signed five hundred and sixty two thousand times
[01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:59.880]  becoming the most signed government online petition since the science launch
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:03.720]  in 2012 but now they're saying there's evidence
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:07.800]  that people individual people signed this same petition
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:13.960]  50 times each so if you've got thousands of people who are organized
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:18.680]  then imagine how many hundreds of thousands of fake signatures
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:22.280]  you could get added onto these petitions obviously triggering
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:27.480]  a parliamentary debate and then i had the don't ban trump petition
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:30.600]  which was uh soaring in signatures then suddenly
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:35.400]  20 30 000 get removed they were not removed from the
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:41.080]  ban trump petition so again some very very shady goings on with that
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:45.160]  we'll be back after the break with alex and with more news we're going to talk
[01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:48.600]  about how the EU is exploiting the refugee crisis
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:53.640]  to basically further a plan for an occupying army this is a huge story

[01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:14.600]  it's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:23.320]  we're back on the alex jones show now stefan mollin you who's been a guest
[01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:27.720]  on the alex jones show before put out a great video yesterday called the truth
[01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:31.400]  about the crusades and this really resonated with me because
[01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:34.840]  i made a video myself about a week ago called islam is
[01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:39.000]  not a religion of peace yes sorry for committing that thought crime
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:43.720]  basically pointing out that the regressive left
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:47.240]  they respond to arguments about you know beheading gay people is bad
[01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:51.880]  stoning rape victims to death is bad executing people who leave the religion
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:54.920]  of islam is bad they respond to those arguments those
[01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:59.000]  very specific arguments which are very specific policies being carried out
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:05.560]  by islamic nations by basically saying oh but what about the crusades
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:10.280]  what about intolerant passages in the bible which nobody even pays attention
[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:13.320]  to anymore nobody has acted on for hundreds of
[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:16.760]  hundreds of years so what about the crusades well
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:20.680]  stefan mollin you about this video basically pointing out
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:24.920]  documenting the historical fact that the crusades
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:31.720]  were a defensive war were a reaction a military reaction to the muslim crusades
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:35.960]  that went for hundreds of years before of course i pointed out
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:39.160]  this is what isis wants again this is their caliphate
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:42.840]  they want to reach europe just as they tried to do
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:46.920]  back you know 1500 years ago but also
[01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:51.320]  mollin you makes the point that we can't have a history
[01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:55.400]  as a european civilization we can't have a history
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:59.400]  and you know blame our defaults our defects on
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:03.880]  the mere fact of the situation at the time the historical context
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:07.960]  it has to all be about white gill so it has to be about
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:12.040]  imperialism you know smallpox blankets genocide
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:16.120]  that's the historical narrative that's been forced down our throats
[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:19.880]  as a european civilization because we're the only ones
[01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:24.120]  who are obsessed with being self-critical when in fact
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:29.560]  as this video documents the slave trade which of course is historically blamed
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:33.800]  on white people and no one else despite the fact that every single other
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:37.720]  race religion was involved in the slave trade throughout history
[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:43.480]  the muslim slave trade was far longer and far more brutal
[01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:48.600]  than the white christian slave trade so this is an excerpt out of stefan
[01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:54.200]  mollin's video the truth about the crusades here it is
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:58.840]  now of course every time you hear about europeans
[01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:06.600]  in sort of the uh mid-last millennia slavery domination imperialism slavery
[01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:10.920]  you european bastards well do you ever hear about islamic
[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:14.760]  slavery you should have because it was really quite a lot very big and
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:17.400]  exceedingly brutal and we got a whole presentation on this channel called the
[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:20.200]  truth about slavery we go into this in more detail but
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:23.640]  islam dominated the slave trade between the seventh
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:28.120]  and fifteenth centuries the christians entered the market of human flesh much
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:32.920]  later 1519 to 1815 is the period of christian slave
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:38.760]  trading the death toll from 14 centuries of the muslim slave
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:43.960]  trade in africa is estimated at over 112
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:47.960]  million souls now the muslim slave trade typically
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:51.640]  dealt in the sale of castrated male slaves called
[01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:57.000]  unix uh unix later to be renamed as an operating system were created by
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:01.320]  completely amputating the scrotum and penis of eight to 12 year old
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:05.720]  african boys as you can imagine the survival rate of this
[01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:12.840]  savage mutilation was very very low and um africans of course in africa
[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:16.200]  constantly complaining about western imperialism european imperialism
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:19.800]  even though life expectancy more than doubled when europeans took over south
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:23.080]  africa do you see a lot of people from africa
[01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:26.360]  going to the islamic countries complaining about the much longer and
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:31.400]  much more brutal islamic slave trade no because
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:37.000]  muslims are not self-critical europeans have gone from self-criticism to
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  pathological civilization and soul-destroying self-hatred but not a
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.720]  lot of people going out to saudi arabia saying hey man you owe us
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:48.680]  reparations for slavery because they'd be like hey you'd be a good slave
[01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:52.200]  that's stefan molyneux with his latest video the truth about the crusades he's
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:56.040]  talking about the fact that the muslim slave trade in that
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:13:00.360]  period of history was far lengthier and far more brutal
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:04.760]  than the white christian slave trade in terms of targeting african and by the
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:06.360]  way paul of course i'm going to be joining you
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:10.040]  alex jones here co-hosting today i've got a working vacation today here at the
[01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:13.160]  office getting a lot of administrative things done
[01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:17.080]  and also preparing for a more tv stations to be picking us up next year a
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:19.240]  lot of am and fm stations joining us as well
[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:21.800]  because i've been doing affiliate relations and cutting hundreds of bumpers
[01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:24.520]  for different stations around the country that have been rightfully
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:26.200]  demanding them because i've been so busy
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:30.840]  i want to apologize for my lack of action on so many of my duties here but we
[01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:33.880]  are overwhelmed in a war folks understand that
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:38.280]  but paul watson hosting most of the show today the big frustration for me is
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:42.360]  islam's been very very diverse it's had some you know golden times in its
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:44.920]  history where it did promote civilization
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:48.360]  but you're right in the west in the last really hundred years the thamian
[01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:52.840]  socialists have killed the amazing history of the west and superimposed over
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:56.920]  it the lie that the west invented nothing did nothing and basically
[01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:00.440]  created slavery slavery has been an ancient human
[01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:03.960]  institution it's wrong it's bad there's varying forms of it but it was well
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:08.680]  known in all history books including islamic history books
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:12.600]  and it said raising heads or black people are not humans
[01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:15.720]  and so you can do whatever you want with them that's a horrible racist statement
[01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:18.280]  but anybody can just google that and pull it up
[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:22.440]  and that's why most of slavery was black people but they also the muslims ran
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:26.120]  white slavery which was sex slavery of any woman they could get basically those
[01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:28.680]  were those were higher dollar and we see ices
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:31.560]  following the old family tradition you know that
[01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:36.120]  18 great grand paul's back were engaged in and it's a frustration that for
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:40.440]  400 years the islamics were attacking europe took over part of poland took
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:43.800]  over spain took i mean went right into germany
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:47.640]  and finally they said look we got to stop this england and france
[01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:51.400]  basically the vikings said wait a minute they're gonna try to beat us we just took
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:54.680]  over the vikings created mass armies that they already
[01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:57.720]  conquered europe and said you want to fight you got one and then they got
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:03.400]  their butts kicked and so the whining puning is there the crusades
[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:06.760]  you know they have all these hollywood movies made about it it's all pure
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:10.760]  100 unadulterated garbage but after all the general public doesn't know the
[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:14.600]  three branches of government so you can tell them that the crusades were an
[01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:18.200]  offensive evil uh no the truth is is that the crusades
[01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:22.680]  were bold operation to take back syria to take back greece to take back the
[01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:26.360]  holy land to take back israel to take back poland to take back
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:30.920]  romania to take back hungry to take back transylvania the list goes on and on
[01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:34.920]  russia had its huge battles okay i would not just with the islamic
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:39.240]  invasion but the huns and the mongols i mean this has been going on forever the
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:42.760]  huns and the mongols wouldn't even keep the women they just kill everybody but
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:47.640]  their brown skin so it's liberal it's liberal it's liberal this is the
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:53.160]  mindlessness and then starting in the 50s and 60s every great boxer basketball
[01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:57.560]  player baseball player almost everyone kareem abdul jabbar
[01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:03.560]  muhammad ali on caches clay muhammad ali because they were taught and told
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:07.640]  that islam was anti-slavery and pro-black
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:11.080]  and it's just not true now i'm not bashing black muslims
[01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:14.840]  a lot of great people there are lots of loving muslims lots of good muslims
[01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:18.120]  subsection things but the one out of saudi arabia
[01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:21.160]  that's that's running the show that just took down libya that's trying to take
[01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:25.000]  down syria it's killing you know i mean 98 percent of the muslims getting
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.840]  killed are by other muslims this is a scourge on muslims and i want to see a
[01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:32.440]  reformed reformation for islam i don't hate these people
[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:36.120]  and a lot of their culture is good and i'm not just saying to be politically
[01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:40.120]  correct it's true but the variety being promoted by the cia
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:43.640]  through saudi arabia is a culture killing evil
[01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:46.680]  and so i have no white guilt i've done nothing
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:49.560]  most white people in this country came from european countries that ever had
[01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:53.160]  slavery or where you were serfs the germans didn't stop me in
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:57.480]  slaves in most areas uh in germania and prussia and
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:01.960]  other areas of the austrian and urian empire until 1884 or so
[01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:06.600]  so i mean there were war slaves that fought george washington the hessians
[01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:11.560]  in the 1770s and 80s but the public is just deathly ignorant of this
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:15.160]  but do you see uh germans who come from family
[01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:17.320]  histories where people were basically war slaves
[01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:20.280]  schwarzenegger has a low name i don't think it's a low name
[01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:23.640]  uh but you know the point is he comes from you know not an elite
[01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:27.080]  austrian germanic family his means basically property
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:30.280]  that's what schwarzenegger black it doesn't mean black people it means you
[01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:34.360]  had dark skin elitists didn't have calluses on their hands they didn't
[01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:38.040]  have suntans they weren't quote rednecks they have white skin
[01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:40.600]  and so that's where this comes from if you have schwarzen in front of your name
[01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:44.760]  it means lower caste uh and that's just how this works same thing in india
[01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:48.680]  this is just the way the world worked how it operated slavery still goes on in
[01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:51.960]  india via the caste system but the average jackass socialist
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:56.360]  founded by the ford foundation and george soros doesn't know this so
[01:17:56.360 --> 01:18:00.520]  that's the key paul what you just hit on right there is it's ridiculous it's
[01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:03.640]  ridiculous most immigrants in this country who are white
[01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:07.400]  have no history of slavery only two to three percent of people that came here
[01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:11.320]  you know before 1860s uh owned slaves i mean
[01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:16.120]  very few family lines in this country uh owned slaves in the south you can run
[01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:18.920]  into quite a bit of people that had some connection to it it's just
[01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:23.400]  bull and you'll have poles and romanians and
[01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:26.680]  and and and others you know all over the country you hear about them being beaten
[01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:29.320]  and shot and killed by racist black mobs the

[01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:26.120]  three times larger and then openly releasing them in the ocean to breed
[01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:32.520]  out regular salmon because i'm against gay fish
[01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:36.120]  i'm against it because
[01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:40.680]  it's very dangerous according to the zoological biological
[01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:44.360]  viral scientist i've interviewed and we already know it's causing chain
[01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:49.080]  reactions look at this headline gay couples to have their own biological
[01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:52.760]  children carrying traits from both parents
[01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:58.120]  so two men will be spliced together without the mitochondrial dna expression
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:01.560]  of the women they don't even know what it's going to do
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:08.280]  i mean this is crazy this is nuts i mean if two men can go out and get a woman
[01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:11.240]  to you know have a baby with one of them or whatever they were whatever
[01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:15.480]  but man let me tell you something this is china already for over 15 years has
[01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:19.080]  human milk produced in cows that's part bovine
[01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:23.960]  for 25 years they've had spider goats and there's already all these new
[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:28.200]  diseases and mutations and drug resistant bacteria i mean
[01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:30.440]  these are plagues i'm going to cover this coming up towards the end of the
[01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:36.520]  hour with paul watson it's just so crazy
[01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:40.760]  how children of the future could have 32 parents dna cocktail on the way
[01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:45.720]  experts warn i can't handle it anymore i mean this is just out of
[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:50.040]  control people say what's wrong with buying from
[01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:53.960]  hong kong a cat that glows in the dark or a monkey
[01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:57.400]  then you read the things are in pain they have mental problems
[01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:04.280]  they're part jellyfish that is a composite organism
[01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:07.720]  and if people have any idea what happens in genetics they can make the genetic
[01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:11.560]  splice once and make the creature they want some of the time but then every
[01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:15.080]  new generation it becomes even more fantastically mutant
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:18.280]  and then jumps into other species once you cross species
[01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:21.000]  there's all sorts of diseases and bacteria and viruses
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:24.920]  that couldn't affect say a human but it affects a dog or it affects a cow
[01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:30.680]  or it affects a insect now the mold that can kill an insect can kill you
[01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:34.280]  or and the first manifestation see i'm covering it now
[01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:38.200]  our allergies that's your body fighting the outside environment
[01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:43.080]  allergies are up 10 20 000 percent in most industrialized societies
[01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:47.240]  and it's all been linked to the gmo and we're only a few seconds into this
[01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:51.960]  revolution we're dead i predict that within 20 years
[01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:54.680]  half the people that they already admitted actually within 10 will have
[01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:58.120]  cancer in the western world and they'll just be acting normal oh let's have a
[01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:02.120]  run for everybody's dying and oh the solidarity and oh you get
[01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:04.920]  attention and pat it on the head and then no one will ask why
[01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:12.600]  half the kids can't talk half the adults are dying of cancer
[01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:15.880]  the globalists are bringing down the world that's why they're bringing in
[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:21.080]  invaders from syria who invaded syria to murder everyone and when they failed
[01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:24.760]  they're bringing them here to just wreck everything and just run around and
[01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:27.960]  boss everyone around and then they're training everyone to submit in the
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:30.680]  media and the schools from Canada to the U.S.
[01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:34.680]  the christmas carols are now worship of Allah i have seven different articles
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:38.120]  from Canada in the U.S. just today it's happening
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:42.760]  on national tv celebrating Allah murdering the christians
[01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:47.720]  celebrating Muhammad killing him you know like it's crazy it's meant to be
[01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:51.880]  crazy they have to instill total mental illness total insanity
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:56.840]  where people just get used to just just crazy stuff yeah fleshing bacteria my
[01:27:56.840 --> 01:27:58.920]  dad wouldn't get his teeth done he's dead a day later
[01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:02.120]  yeah it's all right my wife just died well my kids just died everybody's dying
[01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:05.240]  you know well we don't even bury people in the cemeteries anymore they just
[01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:08.840]  they just use you to heat the power plants that's all been set up so i went
[01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:11.880]  green and just everyone dies everyone's gonna die around you it's just
[01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:16.680]  it's fun oh loving so much fun
[01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:23.240]  cancer is not just bad luck but down to environment studies suggest really
[01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:26.120]  oh they've been trying to push it's all genetic well yeah you're predisposed
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:29.080]  you smoke five packs of cigarettes a day you're gonna get lung cancer
[01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:31.320]  some people are predisposed well they can drink all the liquor they want and
[01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:34.680]  have no liver problems some people drink one drink a day they get liver
[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:38.200]  failure when they're 25
[01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:41.880]  but it isn't the genetics that's causing the increase
[01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:45.400]  what's in the environment now is killing us
[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:52.840]  i know more than 10 people this year in the last 11 and a half months
[01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:58.920]  whose young wives or girlfriends around 25 to 35 have gotten lung cancer and
[01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:03.480]  died remember an abc news article 10 years ago saying that the decade before
[01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:07.240]  that there'd been a seven-fold increase in certain types of lung cancer in
[01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:10.520]  women women's smoking's way down do you know
[01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:13.800]  though what type of viruses have been found in different vaccines that mainly
[01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:18.360]  target women that's the big cause and women take
[01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:22.520]  more vaccines than men they believe in the system they roll their sleeve up
[01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:27.080]  and they say bye bye but 10 years later when you get the lung cancer you don't
[01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:30.280]  know who hit you that's because they sting you
[01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:33.560]  and then it gives you time for you to die so they don't get the blame
[01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:36.440]  but with toddlers when they give them shots they die on the spot that's why
[01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:38.840]  that's been proven the shots are killing them
[01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:47.880]  you like to die the government wants to kill you and they will
[01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:56.680]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:03.880]  joe banks here with info wars dot com article up by paul joseph watson
[01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:08.360]  canadian children sing muhammad worship song a video shows canadian children
[01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:12.040]  singing a song which celebrates muhammad's arrival in medina
[01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:15.800]  after he forced christians to convert to islam under the
[01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:20.520]  threat of death you heard that right the video clip was posted on youtube
[01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:23.320]  one day after prime minister just entered out
[01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:29.960]  and ontario premier kathleen wine personally welcome 163 syrian refugees
[01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:36.360]  into the country it has over 11 000 thumbs up and more than 1.2 million views
[01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:39.560]  although comments were disabled presumably to censor
[01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:43.720]  criticism the video titled welcome to canada syrian refugees
[01:30:43.720 --> 01:30:47.560]  shows that why you're singing one of the oldest songs in the islamic culture

[01:33:12.840 --> 01:33:19.800]  it's alex jones
[01:33:19.800 --> 01:33:27.880]  i went out walking through streets paved with gold
[01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:31.720]  lifted some stones saw the skin and bones
[01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:39.080]  of a city without a soul most cancer is viral i went out if you're alone
[01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:45.160]  if your immune system is still dialed up hasn't been worn out hasn't given up
[01:33:45.160 --> 01:33:49.000]  even viral cancer can be targeted can be shut down
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:53.080]  but if you get overwhelmed by all the other allergens by all the other gmo's
[01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:56.680]  your body just starts reacting to everything and you either get an auto
[01:33:56.680 --> 01:34:01.480]  immune disorder where it turns up too high or it then collapses
[01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:05.640]  and that's what the public's been given is basically a type of environmental
[01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:11.640]  hiv not the virus that supposedly causes age but but that's what it is
[01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:16.040]  is a cocktail of environmental issues that make the immune system and most
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:19.960]  people just simply turn off when your immune system turns off you get
[01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:23.160]  skin cancer you get brain cancer you get lung cancer
[01:34:23.160 --> 01:34:27.000]  you get pancreatic cancer your body stops
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:31.640]  destroying cells that malfunction
[01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:35.480]  and the globalists the rock of fellers that corner the market on cancer by the
[01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:39.960]  20s have all written about their plan they want the earth for themselves they
[01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:43.160]  stole it through fraud they believe they own it
[01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:46.360]  and they are now testing the killing of the public
[01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:51.080]  and testing can they get away with it i mean it's a fact that 30 something
[01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:53.160]  years ago you had one in 25 000 children with a
[01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:57.320]  neurological disorder in the autism spectrum
[01:34:57.320 --> 01:35:00.920]  it's now one in 58 in the u.s and they're saying within 10 years it's going to be
[01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:05.240]  one in three only industrialized countries
[01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:12.280]  have it vaccines are only part of it and vaccines are a trojan horse cover
[01:35:12.280 --> 01:35:15.800]  it's not that we don't believe and know that a learned immunity from a shot
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:18.520]  isn't real it has problems and has side effects
[01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:21.400]  but it's a cost benefit analysis and there's a great medical breakthrough in
[01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:26.280]  many cases just like a ear implant or a bionic eye
[01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:29.960]  i want good vaccines i want clean vaccines you better believe it
[01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:33.000]  but these aren't that
[01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:38.360]  and so i get up here and i tell you um the facts
[01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:42.040]  every time there's an investigation into a so-called vaccine it's got all sorts of
[01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:46.200]  bizarre micro plasms and viruses and things that scientists say are like
[01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:51.240]  artificially made dna and rna packets basically nanotech
[01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:54.200]  they admitted five six years ago with the h1n1
[01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:58.520]  a year later that it was a simulant virus that had been put in the
[01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:04.360]  vaccines a year before that then mutated and activated a year later
[01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:07.160]  because they'd already done a mutation chain with computers
[01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:10.680]  i mean let me tell you what i know they're doing that's on record
[01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:15.400]  is sensationally evil and could put them all in prison for life
[01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:19.240]  crimes against humanity see the nazis tried to conquer with tanks
[01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:23.080]  they had a plan once they took over to do it was soft kill in the food and water
[01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:27.320]  what you're seeing is that plan taken over and adopted by the u.s and
[01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:31.560]  british governments after all hitler came from them
[01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:35.640]  why shouldn't his information from the keiser vilhelm institute
[01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:41.720]  come back home so see once you know all this information
[01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:48.920]  you're not too concerned about what george soros is saying to do are you
[01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:54.280]  fight with each other run out kill some cops
[01:36:56.280 --> 01:37:01.320]  then you see how stupid it all is and for cops who think they're part of the
[01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:04.120]  system are sick of the public now you realize you're being targeted too
[01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:06.600]  aren't you and all you got to do is research what i'm saying you'll find
[01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:09.000]  out is true you'll find out you're being attacked right now
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:12.760]  you want to live in a fantasy land you're being hit by silent weapons for
[01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:17.480]  quiet wars i want to read the pentagon report on that that's the name of it
[01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:24.680]  i want to read colonel alexander's report because the mind has no firewall
[01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:29.160]  and i want to go back to paul watson here i want to hit some other news i mean
[01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:32.760]  speaking of the islamic takeover sweeten's top public broadcaster
[01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:36.040]  bans the use of the word immigrant and now they're going to ban every other
[01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:43.320]  word this is 1984 writ large
[01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:48.760]  and it's only going to get worse unless we say no and stop submitting to it
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:51.480]  they've got all these people that think they're part of the establishment
[01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:55.480]  making 50 a hundred 200 grand a year and they'll do whatever they're told is
[01:37:55.480 --> 01:38:00.120]  yes men and women to stay in power except in the next 10 years
[01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:03.880]  the beginning of the end of the age of humans is supposed to begin
[01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:08.040]  according to the un the transhumanist rake hers well
[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:14.760]  dr urlick dr holder the roth child's
[01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:18.520]  ted turner all of them i've read all their books
[01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:21.640]  i've read their white papers on here i've made films about it
[01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:25.960]  they're all free online how could you not offer a film for free that
[01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:29.320]  has three hours of statements and proof and video clips of how they're going to
[01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:33.080]  slowly murder you and your family quietly by stealth
[01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:36.440]  and laughing at you and you know what the elites have said to me when i've been
[01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:39.720]  off record talking to some of them
[01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:44.280]  some of them here on air like the head of the kissinger group
[01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:47.880]  they say alex the public doesn't want to know you already know that
[01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:52.120]  they don't want your help join us the lifeboats aren't big enough for
[01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:55.880]  everybody the public is unvirtuous that's why
[01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:59.480]  they don't care we care so we're just keeping all
[01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:02.760]  this for ourselves no you're not you did everything you could to make sure
[01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:10.040]  they were unvirtuous nasty little demons and i will not sink to your level

[01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:47.400]  whatever you call yourselves out there if you don't know about the worldwide
[01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:50.680]  eugenics soft kill extermination program if you don't know
[01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:54.840]  that i told you 10 years ago they were heating hospitals with baby parts
[01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:58.520]  we told you two years ago we told you this year if you didn't know i told you
[01:39:58.520 --> 01:40:02.040]  18 years ago they're selling baby parts at plan parenthood
[01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:06.520]  have you figured out yet that everything we talk about
[01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:11.480]  is documented almost all of it's now come out no matter how fantastical i
[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:15.240]  told you it's true
[01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:20.040]  and that's why they've resorted to over a thousand it was 500 on
[01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:23.320]  tuesday it's over a thousand articles this week
[01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:26.760]  saying that i believe the moon landings didn't happen and the giant wasp
[01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:30.920]  live under the un building and they mix into it that also i think fluoride's bad
[01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:34.120]  for you and they mix into it also that governments are staging terror or
[01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:37.160]  letting terrorists attack see they mix real stuff in
[01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:40.920]  with political cyanide
[01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:44.600]  yeah let's go ahead and play the wasp clip i mean this is from last year but
[01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:49.000]  but they're back saying it again here it is an internet talk show called info
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:53.240]  wars yes this is the same guy who has been selling the idea that the massacre
[01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:56.760]  at sandy hook elementary school and the massacre at a war of colorado
[01:40:56.760 --> 01:41:01.240]  were actually fake they were faked as an excuse to take away our guns and
[01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:07.400]  enslave us to the giant wasps who have beneath the un building or whatever
[01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:12.200]  um colorado
[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:17.000]  needs to be investigated it's what i said
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:20.040]  colorado and i'm just going to go over this very slowly but but but but it's
[01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:22.200]  just simply because i can't we're going to go to watson and then cover this other
[01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:27.080]  news i'm going to be very clear about this right now
[01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:30.840]  we broke by the way all of this adan salazar others dug through the guy's
[01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:33.320]  history i couldn't believe it when i saw it
[01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:37.400]  there were admitted crisis actors not not the fake ones there's some sites
[01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:40.760]  think everybody's a crisis actor and i'm jeff bridges
[01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:46.200]  i wish and i know jeff bridges point is there were admitted crisis actors
[01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:48.360]  there and they show up at another shooting
[01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:51.720]  the supposed shooter told everybody in the jail i'm on drugs i'm in a secret
[01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:54.920]  government program they drugged me i was out in the parking lot
[01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:57.640]  a day later then they lied so he was never in
[01:41:57.640 --> 01:42:01.000]  group holding but it turned out he was then it turns out this top air force
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:04.920]  psychiatrist is over and his dad is in a giant human brain neural
[01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:07.960]  interface the most secretive it's nasa and the pentagon
[01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:12.440]  for the mars mission he's involved in a super secret DARPA program
[01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:17.000]  getting 80 something thousand dollars a year for living expenses
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:21.560]  so they said the house is super secret and couldn't go in it for days
[01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:26.520]  and then they play a video of where everyone's shot in the theater 10
[01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:31.480]  seconds before he does it i i mean you cannot make this up
[01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:34.840]  the la pd said that sir hand sir hand didn't shoot rfk
[01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:37.720]  they've now released the ballistics he was shot in the back by a high caliber
[01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:41.240]  we know the name of the ci agent did it
[01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:44.760]  even the london guardian does reports showing how there were like six or seven
[01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:49.640]  top ci people in the audience where he was supposed to speak at the hotel
[01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:53.560]  and of course it was a security detail shot him sir hands hand was
[01:42:53.560 --> 01:42:57.640]  held on the side of the table shooting at the wall i'm that kind of conspiracy
[01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:03.000]  theorist you know when the la pd says the government killed him
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:15.000]  that's in the report that the guy behind him shot him there were cops there
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:20.040]  so yeah uh aurora is the funniest thing i've ever seen
[01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:23.000]  i don't know what happened to sandy hook are there people on my message board
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:26.600]  saying it's totally fake if i had guessed on that i've said
[01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:30.440]  you know they think it's fake and i've been totally polite nice to those guests
[01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:33.640]  and then because i don't follow the exact orthodox that it's all completely fake
[01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:37.480]  then you know i'm anathema and i'm bad something on 9 11 i don't think space
[01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:40.760]  beams did it you know i'm anathema i'm bad i'm an evil person it's just it's all
[01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:44.680]  craziness i know that they're using blue screens
[01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:48.040]  with anderson cooper claiming he was on the site that needs to be investigated
[01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:51.640]  it's a blue screen his face disappears his nose disappears
[01:43:51.640 --> 01:43:55.000]  i know they're running loop tapes in the background i mean i'm in tv i know what
[01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.320]  i'm seeing
[01:43:57.320 --> 01:44:00.760]  i don't know if all these people are right i just know the government has a
[01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:04.200]  long history aligned to us so i'm going to expose it
[01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:07.800]  but this is how they misrepresent everything we
[01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:11.560]  say and everything we do let's stop right there
[01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:16.120]  before i get into all this other news it's a badge of honor for us and for you
[01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:18.520]  and anybody else be ridiculed and attacked notice we just get more
[01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:23.160]  successful as it intensifies and so they have to misrepresent what we say
[01:44:23.160 --> 01:44:27.080]  because they can't stand up against what we've actually
[01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:30.440]  done they have to make it up because they can't
[01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:33.800]  attack the real thing
[01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:39.560]  i mean i couldn't beat up you know let's say the top ufc fighter
[01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:41.960]  you could
[01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:47.880]  but i could build a paper mache like you bring me donald trump in here the
[01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:51.880]  pinata we have see it's the ultimate straw man
[01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:56.840]  i i wouldn't want to attack donald trump but i mean who knows if i could beat
[01:44:56.840 --> 01:44:59.720]  donald trump up he might kick my butt but i guarantee i can kick this
[01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:06.600]  guy's butt because it's a straw man this one's paper mache
[01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:11.560]  it's a paper tiger real tiger i couldn't take on a real tiger but i could
[01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:14.600]  build a paper mache what in the neck like i'm really tough how about a blow-up
[01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:17.480]  alligator pool toy i couldn't take on a 20 foot african
[01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:21.160]  alligator but you know i could i could jump in the water and wrestle around
[01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:24.040]  with a fake one
[01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:30.200]  and that's what these con artists of illusion do to you and your family
[01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:34.840]  is they built a pinata they painted up and fill it full of a bunch of messages
[01:45:34.840 --> 01:45:38.680]  that you didn't say or i didn't say they beat it and then fake messages fall
[01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:43.880]  out and they read them on air but once you know it's a straw man
[01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:48.280]  it's a straw woman it's a pinata it's game over and so they now know you know
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:51.240]  you're being lied to so they're trying to train you to just accept lies and go
[01:45:51.240 --> 01:45:55.080]  hey i'm an authority figure two plus two equals five
[01:45:55.080 --> 01:45:59.720]  raising the debt doesn't raise the debt you didn't build your business
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:06.360]  we're not coming for your guns you know that's brazen crazy lies the most
[01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:11.720]  ever why are they so naked because it's meant to break your will
[01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:16.200]  it's meant to make you just give up it's an act of desperation it's like you
[01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:19.240]  walk up some guy at midnight you know even out at the movies
[01:46:19.240 --> 01:46:21.800]  and a dinner and the guys walking out with your computers enjoying like what are
[01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:24.760]  you doing they're like oh nothing they're just getting this for your neighbor gym
[01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:29.640]  and then they'll walk around the corner drop it and run that's a very common tactic
[01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:31.800]  it's the same thing we're just like hey what are you doing putting flour in the
[01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:35.720]  water oh it's for your teeth it's all these blackout manuals declassified murder
[01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:39.400]  them you know to give them cancer would kill their fertility
[01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:42.520]  hell they even write books and publish them and i'm like hey here's their book
[01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:46.920]  shut up conspiracy theorists there aren't giant wasp under the capital
[01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:53.000]  i didn't say that yeah you did we're gonna put it in 300 newspapers
[01:46:53.960 --> 01:47:00.120]  i didn't say we didn't have a moon landing oh really 500 newspapers say you did
[01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:06.040]  you understand these are hardcore crooks these are slime bags behind the scenes
[01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:10.120]  laughing at you and you know it do don't you and that's why
[01:47:10.120 --> 01:47:14.840]  they hate my guts because i'm not scared of them and i don't care what they do
[01:47:14.840 --> 01:47:19.400]  with their operatives their co-intel pro or their other little operations
[01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:26.120]  i came to fight and i came to win and me and my physical body making it through
[01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:30.440]  this isn't what winning even is winning is committing
[01:47:30.440 --> 01:47:35.960]  and that brings down the providence and that defeats you devils and you know it
[01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:41.720]  i'm a red carpet for the armies to roll over you that's all i am
[01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:46.760]  i'm not the armies that are coming to defeat you
[01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:50.760]  i'm the red carpet they're gonna march on
[01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:54.600]  and so is everybody else fighting right now this is the big war for the future
[01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:58.840]  humanity it's a fantastic situation and i don't
[01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:03.800]  mean fantastically good i mean fantastically deep
[01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:07.000]  briefly because i've been plugging today if you want to support this operation
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:11.400]  instead of clear messages of these scum then fill my coffers for war
[01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:15.480]  and you will see the results as you've already seen
[01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:18.680]  you're not going to find better products at better prices that fund a more
[01:48:18.680 --> 01:48:23.000]  vicious organization that's just nakedly truthful
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:27.400]  nakedly crazed for freedom and ready for everything it takes
[01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:31.640]  free shipping i'm going to extend to the weekend and then it's over
[01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:35.560]  but you cannot get it by december 24th if you don't order pretty much right now
[01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:38.200]  in the next hour or so i'm told that they're going to the if it comes in the
[01:48:38.200 --> 01:48:42.040]  next hour or so that's it but but really it's they're like okay maybe
[01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:45.560]  i mean it's almost questionable if you're in some places really far from
[01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:48.600]  texas a lot of areas it'll be successful
[01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:51.160]  if you order just before noon they said they're going to stay to make sure it
[01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:55.240]  happens but right now it's even questionable
[01:48:55.240 --> 01:48:58.840]  info or store dot com info wars life dot com
[01:48:58.840 --> 01:49:06.040]  or 888-2533139 888-2533139 we got a bunch of specials on the
[01:49:06.040 --> 01:49:09.640]  site as well but here's what it comes down to
[01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:12.520]  whether you spread the word about the show or buy the products whatever pray for
[01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:16.360]  us whatever you got to understand they train all
[01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:20.040]  of us to not think huge epic things are a big deal to just give us a normalcy
[01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:24.200]  bias to just sit here like dodo birds while our
[01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:28.600]  brains are being beaten out by sailors that are going to fry us for dinner
[01:49:28.600 --> 01:49:31.400]  and i'm jumping around squawking and yelling saying let's run to the hills
[01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:34.920]  let's do something and other dodo birds are going look at this weirdo
[01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:40.440]  right as their throat gets rung i'm not a dodo bird in either of you
[01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:43.400]  this is a normal response to get aggressive
[01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:46.440]  to get upon a stump say the enemy's coming i saw him down the road
[01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:49.800]  they burn the village next to us get the weapons get the men get ready
[01:49:49.800 --> 01:49:53.320]  that's a normal human response
[01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:57.720]  and the villagers look at the person and say well that's ol fred you know he's
[01:49:57.720 --> 01:50:00.520]  been he's 60 years old here in the little village
[01:50:00.520 --> 01:50:05.480]  he's never lied the enemy's coming and they get ready
[01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:09.640]  we've told you the truth i'm ol fred we know what we're talking about
[01:50:09.640 --> 01:50:13.080]  madow and all these enemies why do you constantly they're telling you you're

[01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:21.160]  i want to fight these people i want to beat them i know they're tricks
[01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:24.840]  we're as smart as they are smarter and we don't hate humans we don't hate our
[01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:27.640]  fellow people we want to build something good

[01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:35.560]  that's why they're scared of us a good person could take on 50 of these
[01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:40.200]  trash but all you gotta sound to do is get up and get ready like samson
[01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:45.400]  you don't even need a weapon figuratively you got the jaw that ass
[01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:49.400]  you got the will to hack them down but this isn't physical this is an info war

[01:55:27.800 --> 01:55:31.400]  i was obviously talking to a bunch of telecom satellite networks the biggest
[01:55:31.400 --> 01:55:34.760]  ones in the world about putting our systems up on satellites
[01:55:34.760 --> 01:55:37.080]  which we're now doing getting some tv affiliates and things around the
[01:55:37.080 --> 01:55:39.880]  country we haven't even really pushed yet but it's successful it's moderate we
[01:55:39.880 --> 01:55:43.720]  don't we don't try to grow really fast when it comes to expenditures
[01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:48.440]  and i was told by multiple providers that glenn becks been trying to get out
[01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:51.800]  of his satellite contract and then i was told some other inside
[01:55:51.800 --> 01:55:55.000]  baseball by some of the folks in his operation and again i don't wish glenn
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:58.600]  becky any harm or bad i don't see him as competition to me
[01:55:58.600 --> 01:56:01.000]  if he wakes folks up at the new world order that just sends more audience to
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:04.040]  me and me vice versa i have an economic and
[01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:07.480]  political model that i know is accurate there's a very primitive one where
[01:56:07.480 --> 01:56:10.520]  folks think of this show wasn't here they would get some big audience know
[01:56:10.520 --> 01:56:14.120]  their audience would get smaller that's the nature of it it's like
[01:56:14.120 --> 01:56:16.840]  they're being more football fields means there's more football played it
[01:56:16.840 --> 01:56:19.880]  doesn't mean less football fields football's a bigger sport i mean you
[01:56:19.880 --> 01:56:22.760]  people are really stupid
[01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:27.800]  the truth is they just don't like people that are more eloquent or stronger than
[01:56:27.800 --> 01:56:29.720]  them i just admire people more eloquent or
[01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:32.760]  strong than i am if they're good if they're bad i hate their guts and want
[01:56:32.760 --> 01:56:37.000]  to bring them down but uh i just know how much the
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:40.200]  trump people told me that was true seeing this because everything i've been
[01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:43.480]  told ends up coming on the newsletters from newsmax all over the news
[01:56:43.480 --> 01:56:48.840]  trump tweets glenn beck insults says the blaze flagging
[01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:51.880]  donald trump publicly insulting glenn beck on twitter claiming he was fired from
[01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:55.480]  fox news and that his current venture the blaze is flagging
[01:56:55.480 --> 01:56:59.560]  the tweet came wednesday night right after beck said on the kelly file that he
[01:56:59.560 --> 01:57:04.840]  wouldn't vote for trump and was unsure whether he was any better than hillary
[01:57:04.840 --> 01:57:09.960]  was from a guy that loves george w bush and then it just goes on to kind of
[01:57:09.960 --> 01:57:13.960]  write an article against trump to a certain extent i'm not going to get in
[01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:18.120]  the middle of this but i can just tell you i have been told by people in
[01:57:18.120 --> 01:57:22.680]  dallas and people in satellite networks i mean i sent buckley
[01:57:22.680 --> 01:57:27.400]  to chicago and to los vegas to the big trade shows and the big satellite deals
[01:57:27.400 --> 01:57:30.920]  and we met people from germany people from europe people from the us i mean we
[01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:35.080]  met with like 15 companies and we were offered based they were like
[01:57:35.080 --> 01:57:38.840]  we want glenn beck's channel i'm like i can't pay for that are you crazy
[01:57:38.840 --> 01:57:43.160]  put that big you know peacock thing where i'm on a coal cable channel
[01:57:43.160 --> 01:57:47.240]  we're doing the opposite we send out a feed that u h f v h f and cable can get
[01:57:47.240 --> 01:57:51.080]  and just put us on if they want it on basic cable or on local tv where there's
[01:57:51.080 --> 01:57:54.520]  actually an audience i don't want to be channel five thousand and twenty nine
[01:57:54.520 --> 01:57:57.800]  or whatever it is in somebody's area where no one's watching i mean i actually
[01:57:57.800 --> 01:58:02.120]  studied this stuff i can go shoot a facebook mentions at the house and get
[01:58:02.120 --> 01:58:05.720]  some million views two million views three million views
[01:58:05.720 --> 01:58:10.520]  i mean that's bigger than the whole ten hours of msnbc it's just
[01:58:10.520 --> 01:58:15.000]  it was oh but she'll be on cable oh oh my gosh the emperor's new clothes will you

[01:59:55.640 --> 02:00:18.600]  by the way tonight seven o'clock central very special edition of
[02:00:18.600 --> 02:00:22.440]  info wars nightly news we did a fun little star wars parody deal
[02:00:22.440 --> 02:00:26.600]  with myself in a cryo chamber of more that's going to be ready tonight
[02:00:26.600 --> 02:00:30.280]  and we're going to have jacari jackson and kit daniels out
[02:00:30.280 --> 02:00:34.200]  coming out with their review tonight also they're going out to a rob
[02:00:34.200 --> 02:00:37.160]  Jacobson to do that tonight and people like why does that entertainment
[02:00:37.160 --> 02:00:39.960]  matter you just said it's all diversion i know we hijacked the diversion to
[02:00:39.960 --> 02:00:42.680]  cover it speaking of what's not a diversion i've
[02:00:42.680 --> 02:00:44.840]  told you they're going to put women in the military
[02:00:44.840 --> 02:00:48.040]  when every study in every culture throughout history shows it doesn't work
[02:00:48.040 --> 02:00:51.800]  to have women in frontline combat men are designed
[02:00:51.800 --> 02:00:55.720]  genetically to be able to handle seeing people hacked up and die around them
[02:00:55.720 --> 02:00:59.320]  and not all men are that's why they have you know pre-training and things decide
[02:00:59.320 --> 02:01:03.160]  who's the soldier and who isn't not all men are cut out to do such brutal
[02:01:03.160 --> 02:01:07.640]  really terrible things on the face of it women make magical babies
[02:01:07.640 --> 02:01:10.280]  and they're sweet and beautiful and smart and everything and the men go around
[02:01:10.280 --> 02:01:13.640]  and savagely choke people to death and ram daggers through their eyes and
[02:01:13.640 --> 02:01:17.560]  savagely hack their guts open uh you know and run around with five arrows
[02:01:17.560 --> 02:01:21.720]  sticking out of you still slaughtering people i mean that's not women
[02:01:21.720 --> 02:01:24.760]  but they're going to make the pack sizes smaller and all of it to screw up the
[02:01:24.760 --> 02:01:28.120]  military because the age of the machines is here
[02:01:28.120 --> 02:01:31.640]  Defense Secretary Ash Carter admits improper use of personal email account
[02:01:31.640 --> 02:01:37.320]  but that doesn't really matter because the real news is that
[02:01:37.320 --> 02:01:41.560]  army women hurt more often in combat training
[02:01:41.560 --> 02:01:46.680]  experience more mental health issues oh yeah and the best part is they don't
[02:01:46.680 --> 02:01:49.240]  really fight with the men it's the other women
[02:01:49.240 --> 02:01:52.840]  i mean let's just get real about women on average men on average too but women
[02:01:52.840 --> 02:01:56.200]  start fight with women the problem with women in the workplace
[02:01:56.200 --> 02:01:59.400]  on average any major study is they start fight with each other
[02:01:59.400 --> 02:02:02.600]  now women do fine a lot of times just with men though there can be some
[02:02:02.600 --> 02:02:05.880]  problems there obviously there's nothing wrong with women and you can find
[02:02:05.880 --> 02:02:09.000]  women tougher than men but the statistics don't show that it's like
[02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:12.680]  you can find a european long-distance runner who can beat a
[02:02:12.680 --> 02:02:15.800]  top Kenyan comes around every once in a while but it's not
[02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:19.240]  the majority you know like 90 something percent of the winners are Kenyan
[02:02:19.240 --> 02:02:22.280]  it's not even black people you know i can't even
[02:02:22.280 --> 02:02:25.560]  compete with them well the numbers are staggering
[02:02:25.560 --> 02:02:29.000]  women aren't as strong women aren't as fast women aren't as
[02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:33.000]  vicious women aren't have three times the connections between left and right
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:36.200]  hemispheres of their brain so they're more intuitive about
[02:02:36.200 --> 02:02:40.680]  social issues but also can be manipulated easier by propaganda
[02:02:40.680 --> 02:02:45.080]  advertising on average this is on average and get more confused in a battle
[02:02:45.080 --> 02:02:48.840]  situation and don't follow orders
[02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:52.520]  and this is many women that get in a fetal position women also flip out and
[02:02:52.520 --> 02:02:56.680]  then go attack the enemy and show your position
[02:02:56.680 --> 02:03:01.080]  you don't think the pentagon the best killers in the world didn't know that
[02:03:01.080 --> 02:03:05.080]  they're getting ready to spike humans they're getting rid of the weapon
[02:03:05.080 --> 02:03:09.400]  systems they're obsolete and that's what this is
[02:03:09.400 --> 02:03:12.280]  army women hurt my and then it goes through this whole story
[02:03:12.280 --> 02:03:15.720]  in this washington times article it's just off the chart numbers and that's
[02:03:15.720 --> 02:03:19.000]  because they're all announcing oh in the next decade they're going to place
[02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:23.080]  most of combat trips with combat robots land sea and air
[02:03:23.080 --> 02:03:26.920]  notice you're all hearing this down the news humans aren't going to be
[02:03:26.920 --> 02:03:30.840]  involved they'll have humans to negotiate at point blank range in social
[02:03:30.840 --> 02:03:33.240]  services stuff or rounding folks up be taken to
[02:03:33.240 --> 02:03:36.040]  reeducation centers there'll be women involved in that
[02:03:36.040 --> 02:03:39.480]  there'll be women as jail guards they make great commasars
[02:03:39.480 --> 02:03:43.480]  but it's the end of men in almost all cases
[02:03:43.480 --> 02:03:46.760]  involved in combat this is a direct plan to destroy the military
[02:03:46.760 --> 02:03:49.400]  what you see in every other plan paul i'm gonna do a few more minutes with you
[02:03:49.400 --> 02:03:52.200]  and then peter shifts coming up to get into the interest rate raise and more
[02:03:52.200 --> 02:03:55.640]  but you've been hearing me rant what's your take on the rise of the robots and
[02:03:55.640 --> 02:04:00.360]  the women being put in directly to sabotage the military
[02:04:00.360 --> 02:04:03.560]  well i mean the rise of the robots because there was a big controversy
[02:04:03.560 --> 02:04:06.840]  about these sex box a couple of months ago
[02:04:06.840 --> 02:04:11.400]  that could make women obsolete so the feminists weren't happy about that
[02:04:11.400 --> 02:04:14.920]  but i mean as to your point about you know normalizing the bizarre
[02:04:14.920 --> 02:04:19.480]  we had a story last week about a transgender father who abandoned his
[02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:23.880]  seven children to become a six year old girl and a lot of the progressives
[02:04:23.880 --> 02:04:28.120]  supported him for doing that so again if you can normalize
[02:04:28.120 --> 02:04:30.920]  something like that you can normalize anything and it's
[02:04:30.920 --> 02:04:35.080]  you know obviously we tolerate people but that doesn't mean you have to endorse
[02:04:35.080 --> 02:04:39.480]  complete dishonest like that so i mean if they can normalize that
[02:04:39.480 --> 02:04:45.400]  you know anything goes absolutely paul i want to get into al-qaeda with you and
[02:04:45.400 --> 02:04:48.680]  big developments on that front then i'll hand the baton to you and peter shift
[02:04:48.680 --> 02:04:52.840]  straight ahead talk about the economy and more it's the friday edition i'll be
[02:04:52.840 --> 02:04:58.520]  back myself this sunday or six p.m central by the way
[02:04:58.520 --> 02:05:03.320]  joe bigs here with info wars dot com washington state rep drafts bill to do
[02:05:03.320 --> 02:05:07.320]  away with safe spaces the idea that a college should be a safe
[02:05:07.320 --> 02:05:10.680]  space completely misunderstands the purpose of college
[02:05:10.680 --> 02:05:15.400]  article up by campus reform inspired by a story originally reported by campus
[02:05:15.400 --> 02:05:19.720]  reform a state representative in washington has introduced legislation
[02:05:19.720 --> 02:05:24.200]  defending free speech against the encroachment of safe spaces
[02:05:24.200 --> 02:05:28.600]  state rep matt manweller told campus reform that he plans to introduce his
[02:05:28.600 --> 02:05:32.200]  academic bill of rights as soon as the general assembly
[02:05:32.200 --> 02:05:36.360]  reconvenes in january adding that many of his republican colleagues have
[02:05:36.360 --> 02:05:40.120]  already agreed to sign on as co-sponsors and he has been
[02:05:40.120 --> 02:05:44.280]  encouraged by the interest democrats have shown in the idea as well
[02:05:44.280 --> 02:05:48.600]  menweller told jason kance in a recent radio interview that he had watched the
[02:05:48.600 --> 02:05:52.760]  erosion of free speech on campuses elsewhere in the country guess what we

[02:13:58.360 --> 02:14:03.160]  men because we're gay oh what's that discriminating against women it's that it gives mutations it
[02:14:03.160 --> 02:14:09.080]  causes all sorts of problems etop scientists are warning in the newspapers right here experts
[02:14:09.080 --> 02:14:15.160]  warn is the headline but see you've got to accept the clones and the crime eras and the crosses
[02:14:15.160 --> 02:14:22.280]  because you're sexist if you don't let the very species be mutated now you see what political
[02:14:22.280 --> 02:14:28.200]  correctness really is transhumanism on pcp paul watcher your comment on this and then we'll move
[02:14:28.200 --> 02:14:35.880]  into economic news well i mean alex we live in a world where you know the 911 first responders
[02:14:35.880 --> 02:14:43.080]  were ignored left to die while kaitlyn jenna is given a courage award this is the kind of
[02:14:43.080 --> 02:14:51.000]  bizarro land we live in and again the tolerance should be about defending minorities in terms of
[02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:56.760]  people who have their hands chopped off people who are beheaded for being homosexual women who are
[02:14:56.760 --> 02:15:02.280]  blamed when they're raped and then they get stoned to death honor killings for women who look twice
[02:15:02.280 --> 02:15:09.000]  at men that's what the tolerance movement should all be about but in the west it's like you know
[02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:16.520]  feminists oh there's a there's a rape there's a college rape campus epidemic one in five women
[02:15:16.520 --> 02:15:22.760]  on college campuses are getting raped complete bs we've known it's been bs for years and years in
[02:15:22.760 --> 02:15:27.720]  fact women on college campuses are less likely to get raped than women in the general population
[02:15:27.720 --> 02:15:34.120]  but that's what feminists are concerned about meanwhile the west is importing a real rape
[02:15:34.120 --> 02:15:39.880]  culture and there's absolute silence on it and that's because the globalist the ford foundation
[02:15:39.880 --> 02:15:44.520]  all of them admitted they wanted to end the family and the security of men and women and
[02:15:44.520 --> 02:15:49.480]  children together and so they want to kill where women have the best support the west so they're
[02:15:49.480 --> 02:15:54.360]  teaching women how to homicide the west and homicide their boys and teach them to be little
[02:15:54.360 --> 02:16:00.040]  gibbering mental patients women are being taught how to suicide the culture and the men are being
[02:16:00.040 --> 02:16:05.800]  turned into arrested development gibbering morons this is a scientific attack as latimer putin has
[02:16:05.800 --> 02:16:10.680]  said correctly so is the global warming hoax as latimer putin has said correctly notice latimer
[02:16:10.680 --> 02:16:16.600]  putin wasn't saying this five years ago latimer putin is tuned in to the info war and alexander

[02:16:55.080 --> 02:17:00.840]  accurately predicted the house price crash and the 2008 economic collapse and he joins us
[02:17:00.840 --> 02:17:05.560]  right now peter welcome to the show well thanks for having me on and now you're doing a good job
[02:17:05.560 --> 02:17:11.880]  sitting in for alex thanks appreciate it so the dowell basically dropped about 300 points today
[02:17:11.880 --> 02:17:17.640]  it's it's gone up a little bit since given that it took this long to raise the interest rate by such
[02:17:17.640 --> 02:17:23.400]  a small amount what does that tell you about the confidence that the federal reserve has
[02:17:23.400 --> 02:17:30.520]  in the health of the u.s economy well it doesn't tell us anything you know the fed was talking
[02:17:30.520 --> 02:17:35.160]  about the fact that it was going to raise rates later in the year that they thought the economy
[02:17:35.160 --> 02:17:39.400]  would be strong enough so that it would be appropriate to raise rates before year end
[02:17:39.400 --> 02:17:44.520]  and of course the analysts were expecting the rate hikes to come a lot sooner they were people
[02:17:44.520 --> 02:17:48.920]  thought they would have done it at least two or three times by now but the fed kept passing and
[02:17:48.920 --> 02:17:53.400]  kept talking about how they were data dependent all of a sudden they got to december there's two
[02:17:53.400 --> 02:17:58.840]  weeks left of the year rates are still at zero and i think they thought that if they didn't raise
[02:17:58.840 --> 02:18:04.440]  them now they would lose their credibility it would prove that the economy was too weak to a
[02:18:04.440 --> 02:18:10.120]  standard rate hike so i think to try to create a false sense of confidence and to try to save
[02:18:10.120 --> 02:18:16.280]  some of their credibility they raise interest rates by a token amount in a symbolic gesture
[02:18:16.280 --> 02:18:22.360]  to try to save face and create confidence and you know what it's backfiring on them as i thought
[02:18:22.360 --> 02:18:27.480]  you know the market is down substantially we're down down what about 250 points as we speak it
[02:18:27.480 --> 02:18:33.640]  was down almost 300 it dropped 250 points yesterday but the real carnage is going on beneath the scenes
[02:18:34.200 --> 02:18:38.440]  look at what's happening in the high yield bond market look what's happening in some of these
[02:18:38.440 --> 02:18:45.240]  leveraged funds we're seeing all sorts of things blowing up it looks very much like the way the
[02:18:45.240 --> 02:18:52.760]  markets were looking in the months leading up to the 2008 financial crisis and third policy makers
[02:18:52.760 --> 02:18:59.320]  i read they're predicting a rate of 3.25 percent by the end of 2018 is that even remotely feasible
[02:18:59.880 --> 02:19:04.680]  i don't think so i i think it could be negative we could have a negative sign in front of the
[02:19:04.680 --> 02:19:11.320]  uh the nominal rate before the end of next year look the fed doesn't understand uh the impact of
[02:19:11.320 --> 02:19:17.080]  its monetary policy the fed has done tremendous damage to the economy over the past seven years
[02:19:17.080 --> 02:19:22.200]  and now as they're trying to remove the stimulus all the serve all the damage is rising to the
[02:19:22.200 --> 02:19:28.120]  surface so the fed is expecting this recovery to continue the recovery is over and we are at the
[02:19:28.120 --> 02:19:33.160]  in the beginning of the next recession and it wasn't a real recovery when i talked about a recovery
[02:19:33.160 --> 02:19:39.160]  it was a bubble masquerading as a company as a recovery we just the fed inflated a giant bubble
[02:19:39.160 --> 02:19:44.600]  and all we did is borrow a bunch of money and spend it but meanwhile the real economy the
[02:19:44.600 --> 02:19:49.560]  structure of the economy weakened and we have all this debt and all this speculation that needs to
[02:19:49.560 --> 02:19:54.440]  be unwound and it's going to be done in a very painful way okay pete's shift we'll be right

[02:24:06.040 --> 02:24:17.480]  this is the Alex Jones show live with me I'm Paul Joseph Watson we're talking to economist
[02:24:17.480 --> 02:24:22.840]  Peter Schiff Euro PAC dot com and Peter you were getting into it just before the break
[02:24:22.840 --> 02:24:29.160]  this illusion of economic prosperity has been maintained to a great extent by these low interest
[02:24:29.160 --> 02:24:36.200]  rates making the debt at least serviceable but how on earth is the Fed going to keep raising these
[02:24:36.200 --> 02:24:41.960]  rates when as you said there's no real economic recovery to back it up well they're not I mean
[02:24:41.960 --> 02:24:46.680]  they're just pretending that they can do it to try to create a false sense of confidence where
[02:24:46.680 --> 02:24:52.200]  there should be no confidence but yes the whole thing that's kept this economy afloat has been
[02:24:52.200 --> 02:24:56.920]  dead you know if people have been leaving the labor force as people have been losing their
[02:24:56.920 --> 02:25:02.280]  full-time jobs and they've been accepting part-time jobs as more and more young people are spending
[02:25:02.280 --> 02:25:08.120]  more and more time in school because there's no jobs out there we've been running up all this debt
[02:25:08.120 --> 02:25:12.920]  we have all the student loans we have all the car you know the auto loans more people borrowing
[02:25:12.920 --> 02:25:18.040]  against their homes on their credit cards everybody is levering up in order to survive
[02:25:18.600 --> 02:25:24.520]  and it's all being made possible by the Fed but eventually this is going to come to a horrible end
[02:25:24.520 --> 02:25:32.760]  and as this bubble bursts. Now a lot of our listeners own gold as you know I noticed that
[02:25:32.760 --> 02:25:37.560]  gold plunged after the right announcement the dollar surge but it's gold has recovered a lot
[02:25:37.560 --> 02:25:43.240]  of ground today what's the immediate future looking like for precious metals? Well you know
[02:25:43.240 --> 02:25:48.760]  gold was up before the announcement the day of the announcement goal was maybe up about
[02:25:48.760 --> 02:25:54.600]  well 15 bucks and then it was pretty flat after they moved and then yesterday gold dropped over
[02:25:54.600 --> 02:26:01.720]  $20 and basically tested the lows for the year today it's up about $15 so we have had some
[02:26:01.720 --> 02:26:07.480]  volatility ever since the Fed moved but the interesting thing is we're not getting a big
[02:26:07.480 --> 02:26:11.880]  sell-off which is what everybody had been forecasting now what I've been saying is it was
[02:26:11.880 --> 02:26:17.560]  going to be a buy the rumor sell the fact gold has been falling for years on anticipation of this
[02:26:17.560 --> 02:26:22.280]  rate hike and now that we've got it out of the way I think gold's going to get bought not sold
[02:26:22.280 --> 02:26:27.240]  and in fact the anticipation is not going to live up to the hype because I believe it's a
[02:26:27.240 --> 02:26:32.520]  one and done and I think the market is going to sense this as the US stock market starts to fall
[02:26:32.520 --> 02:26:38.680]  as the economic data continues to come out weak in fact the data we got this week today yesterday
[02:26:39.240 --> 02:26:44.120]  even on the you know on Wednesday when the Fed hiked the data was all horrible on industrial
[02:26:44.120 --> 02:26:51.080]  production capacity utilization ISM manufacturing Philly Fed even the service sector today we got
[02:26:51.080 --> 02:26:56.520]  number there the service sector PMI plunged the lowest level of the year so the data is getting
[02:26:56.520 --> 02:27:01.240]  worse and that's before the stock market started rolling over and that's before the Fed hiked rate
[02:27:01.240 --> 02:27:05.560]  so I think the gold market is going to smell that the next thing coming from the Fed is going to be
[02:27:05.560 --> 02:27:12.520]  the stench of a rate cut and QE4 and I think you're going to start to see a lot of buying
[02:27:12.520 --> 02:27:17.320]  in the gold market you know how quickly it's going to begin it's hard to say but I think there's a
[02:27:17.320 --> 02:27:21.800]  lot of upside potential in gold and I think most of the downside risk is already gone
[02:27:23.720 --> 02:27:29.160]  now let's turn to oil because the financial terms reports that quote the amount of oil now at sea
[02:27:29.160 --> 02:27:33.880]  is at least double the levels of earlier this year and is equivalent to more than a day of
[02:27:33.880 --> 02:27:40.360]  global oil supply we've also got this flow tiller which zero hedge reported on of stationary
[02:27:40.360 --> 02:27:46.760]  super tankers around galveston texas the last time we saw prices this low in terms of oil
[02:27:46.760 --> 02:27:53.400]  was during the last great recession and even CNNs reporting quote the last time raw materials like
[02:27:53.400 --> 02:27:57.400]  copper and oil with this cheap and economic depression loomed just around the corner so
[02:27:57.400 --> 02:28:02.440]  Peter does this oil price crash signal the beginning of the next financial collapse I think
[02:28:02.440 --> 02:28:07.720]  it's one of the signals it's not the only one but yes there is incredibly weak demand globally and
[02:28:07.720 --> 02:28:13.720]  in the United States and if you look at the transportation index Dowdowns transportations
[02:28:13.720 --> 02:28:20.600]  today it's at a 20 month low it is significantly weaker than the industrials or the utilities
[02:28:20.600 --> 02:28:26.280]  and you would think that this sector would be the largest beneficiary of cheap oil prices because
[02:28:26.280 --> 02:28:32.360]  oil is a big component in your transportation cost yet this is the weakest index and that's
[02:28:32.360 --> 02:28:37.320]  because it's the most economically sensitive and you know a lot of people are trying to blame
[02:28:37.320 --> 02:28:42.440]  the weakness in the stock market on the weakness in oil I mean that's nonsense talk about bad logic
[02:28:42.440 --> 02:28:47.320]  the truth is that oil prices in the stock market are going down for the same reason and that's
[02:28:47.320 --> 02:28:52.040]  because the economy is going down and the fact that the transportation's are the weakest index
[02:28:52.040 --> 02:28:57.480]  of all despite lower oil prices proves this but I think what's going to turn the oil market is
[02:28:57.480 --> 02:29:02.360]  going to be the turn in the dollar because once the dollar tanks I think that's going to ignite
[02:29:02.360 --> 02:29:08.680]  a lot more global demand for oil because I think the high dollar the overpriced dollar
[02:29:08.680 --> 02:29:14.360]  is suppressing global demand right now. Now I want to get into this after the break we got a
[02:29:14.360 --> 02:29:19.880]  long segment coming up but Pew came out of this big study last week basically said that the middle
[02:29:19.880 --> 02:29:25.320]  class in America has shrunk to a point where it no longer constitutes the majority of the adult
[02:29:25.320 --> 02:29:32.520]  population what I found most interesting about this was what they considered to be middle class in
[02:29:32.520 --> 02:29:39.000]  terms of income that's what I want to discuss after the break with Peter Schiff of EuroPak.com

[02:33:28.600 --> 02:33:35.000]  well that's alex joneshaw joined by pete schiff of euro pack dot com was just getting into this
[02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:40.280]  before the break q came out of the big study last week the american middle class has shrunk to a
[02:33:40.280 --> 02:33:47.240]  point where it no longer constitutes the majority of the adult population now first of all they
[02:33:47.240 --> 02:33:55.000]  consider the middle class to be a family of three family of three earning upwards of 42 000 a year
[02:33:55.880 --> 02:34:01.720]  i mean peter with the cost of living these days is it really accurate to say that somebody earning
[02:34:01.720 --> 02:34:08.520]  you know an average 21 grand a year is middle class that makes no sense now we've really lowered the
[02:34:08.520 --> 02:34:15.160]  bar on the definition of middle class you know middle class lifestyle in america used to be
[02:34:15.160 --> 02:34:19.960]  something that the rest of the world couldn't even aspire to you know if you remember the the
[02:34:19.960 --> 02:34:27.560]  sitcom the brady bunch which was even the 1970s right in the brady bunch uh mike was an architect
[02:34:28.360 --> 02:34:33.880]  he he had a job that his wife carol didn't have a job she stayed at home and she she you know
[02:34:33.880 --> 02:34:38.920]  worked with charity events you did school events one thing she didn't do was the housework because
[02:34:38.920 --> 02:34:44.840]  they had a full-time live in maid named alex and they were able to support six kids that was
[02:34:44.840 --> 02:34:49.960]  middle class and they didn't have they had two cars i'm sure they didn't have any loans against
[02:34:49.960 --> 02:34:54.760]  those cars they probably didn't have any credit card debt i'm sure mike saved a lot of money
[02:34:54.760 --> 02:35:00.520]  for their retirement that was middle class life in america your dad worked your mom didn't you had
[02:35:00.520 --> 02:35:06.440]  a you had a housekeeper you had lots of savings you had no debt today you're talking about that
[02:35:06.440 --> 02:35:11.480]  family of three the reason it's three is because they're too broke to have any more kids one is all
[02:35:11.480 --> 02:35:16.200]  they can afford and you probably have both the husband and the wife both working and together
[02:35:16.200 --> 02:35:21.720]  they're making 40 000 a year they're probably up to their eyeballs in debt car loans credit card debt
[02:35:21.720 --> 02:35:26.120]  maybe they have student loans if they have a house they got a big mortgage they've got nothing for
[02:35:26.120 --> 02:35:33.160]  retirement they're flat broke yet that's supposed to be the new middle class i mean two breadwinners
[02:35:33.160 --> 02:35:39.320]  earning 42 000 a year that's middle class that shows you how again how low the bar has been set
[02:35:39.320 --> 02:35:43.560]  and it's you know it's like when they call them mega rich the one percent all these occupy wall
[02:35:43.560 --> 02:35:49.880]  street people when that one percent bracket includes households earning over 500 000 a year
[02:35:49.880 --> 02:35:55.320]  so that's going to include you know professional small medium business owners the people who create
[02:35:55.320 --> 02:36:01.880]  jobs and employ people so these labels just don't conform to reality anymore do they yeah no i mean
[02:36:01.880 --> 02:36:08.920]  imagine back in the 1930s or 40s or 50s or 60s i mean if you had a job if you were a man and you had
[02:36:08.920 --> 02:36:15.560]  a job any job right if you were a butcher a baker or candlestick maker your wife didn't have to work
[02:36:15.560 --> 02:36:21.480]  you could pay the bills right without her working i mean how much does somebody have to earn today
[02:36:21.480 --> 02:36:26.120]  to enable the other spouse not to work even if it's the woman that has a job and and and there's
[02:36:26.120 --> 02:36:32.600]  a stay at home uh husband i mean i would say that in order to enjoy the standard of living that was
[02:36:32.600 --> 02:36:38.200]  typical among many middle class americans uh you know earlier you probably have to have a guy with a
[02:36:38.200 --> 02:36:44.200]  job of at least 150 to 200 000 a year that's probably what you need to earn to be considered
[02:36:44.200 --> 02:36:49.160]  middle class you know back in the 1950s how many people earn that money very few
[02:36:51.160 --> 02:36:57.320]  and liberals continue to blame this shrinking middle class on the quote one percent which is
[02:36:57.320 --> 02:37:04.200]  really the 0.01 percent they blame it on skewed income inequality which of course is why they want
[02:37:04.200 --> 02:37:09.880]  higher taxes and wealth redistribution yeah is that the real reason for the shrinking middle class
[02:37:09.880 --> 02:37:13.960]  not at all they have to take a hard look in the mirror if they want to find out why the middle
[02:37:13.960 --> 02:37:18.840]  class class has shrank you know this was the predictable outcome of their big government
[02:37:18.840 --> 02:37:24.840]  policies what created the middle class was free market capitalism it was the absence of government
[02:37:24.840 --> 02:37:30.280]  that enabled the middle class to emerge right it was a lack of taxes a lack of regulation but the
[02:37:30.280 --> 02:37:36.200]  minute that the liberals decided to come up with all these rules and regulations to protect people
[02:37:36.200 --> 02:37:42.840]  right to protect people from uh being exploited or from the vigorous of of capitalism right once
[02:37:42.840 --> 02:37:47.880]  we erected a massive government we destroyed the middle class we made we made the middle class much
[02:37:47.880 --> 02:37:53.720]  poorer we basically killed the goose that laid all the golden eggs uh that enabled that middle
[02:37:53.720 --> 02:38:01.080]  class and so now we have all this poverty because of the government anti-poverty programs the widening
[02:38:01.080 --> 02:38:05.800]  divide between the rich and the poor is being manufactured by government and now even more
[02:38:05.800 --> 02:38:09.880]  slow with the help of the federal reserve that is really putting the nail in the coffins of the
[02:38:09.880 --> 02:38:16.760]  middle class now i wanted to touch on the minimum wage because there's a state rep democratic state
[02:38:16.760 --> 02:38:22.280]  rep in missouri michael butler has prefiled legislation that would raise the state's minimum
[02:38:22.280 --> 02:38:29.320]  wage from seven dollars 65 per hour to 15 dollars per hour we've seen this already being phased in
[02:38:29.320 --> 02:38:34.920]  through local ordinances in places like washington and california you know barack obama's right
[02:38:34.920 --> 02:38:41.480]  behind it at least up to 10 an hour what impact would doubling the minimum wage in the united
[02:38:41.480 --> 02:38:46.360]  states have on the jobs market well it would destroy a lot of jobs i mean if you want to see
[02:38:46.360 --> 02:38:50.920]  what happens when you have a huge increase in the minimum wage you can look at places like
[02:38:50.920 --> 02:38:55.800]  americans samoa you know we increased their minimum wage dramatically years ago and we
[02:38:55.800 --> 02:39:01.160]  decimated their entire economy we plunged them into a depression unemployment went up to 30% it
[02:39:01.160 --> 02:39:07.640]  was practically zero before the minimum wage hike uh and inflation skyrocketed too uh also you can
[02:39:07.640 --> 02:39:12.760]  look at what happened in portorico years ago when we did that in fact portorico today has a much higher
[02:39:12.760 --> 02:39:17.800]  unemployment rate than america because the minimum wage effectively is much higher there because the
[02:39:17.800 --> 02:39:23.800]  average pay scale in portorico is lower so we're going to decimate you know jobs with a big increase
[02:39:23.800 --> 02:39:28.440]  in the minimum wage but the sad reality is before we even had a minimum wage and the minimum wage
[02:39:28.440 --> 02:39:33.880]  was created during the 1930s right part of the new deal with roosevelt but before we had a minimum
[02:39:33.880 --> 02:39:40.520]  wage american workers in real terms adjusted for inflation had higher incomes before the minimum
[02:39:40.520 --> 02:39:46.280]  wage than they do now and one of the reasons the minimum wage is so destructive is because it prevents
[02:39:46.280 --> 02:39:51.480]  people from getting their first job and your first job is what leads to your second job and your third
[02:39:51.480 --> 02:39:58.120]  job it's where you get important on the job training it is the first lung rung in the job ladder
[02:39:58.120 --> 02:40:03.640]  and the more rungs that they cut off from the bottom by raising the minimum wage the higher
[02:40:03.640 --> 02:40:08.680]  they make it for people to get on that ladder and you know the minimum wage law doesn't hurt
[02:40:08.680 --> 02:40:15.480]  businesses it hurts people it hurts individuals it is a law that prevent that prohibits people from
[02:40:15.480 --> 02:40:21.000]  selling their labor if they can't find somebody willing to buy it for that minimum level so you
[02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:26.200]  price a lot of people out of the labor market and what do they do they just end up on welfare or they
[02:40:26.200 --> 02:40:31.560]  commit crimes and they end up in prison it is a complete disaster the government has destroyed
[02:40:31.560 --> 02:40:37.800]  so many lives with this minimum wage and now they want to make it even higher i mean i think it was
[02:40:37.800 --> 02:40:43.720]  you that made the video where you went out to a shopping mall or whatever and asked people if they
[02:40:43.720 --> 02:40:48.440]  supported the minimum wage basically all of them did and then you said well how do you how you like
[02:40:48.440 --> 02:40:52.920]  paying double for that flat screen television and of course they had a very different opinion
[02:40:52.920 --> 02:40:58.360]  but in the sense of the election yeah i was asking people at walmart if they would be willing to pay
[02:40:58.360 --> 02:41:04.840]  15 percent higher prices so that walmart workers could get paid $15 an hour and nobody wanted to do
[02:41:04.840 --> 02:41:13.960]  it yeah they all want to pay 15 yeah they did they didn't they weren't even prepared to pay 15 percent
[02:41:13.960 --> 02:41:20.440]  more no well i want to turn to the election because of course we had the republican debates
[02:41:20.440 --> 02:41:26.200]  this week you pointed out in your recent article um that the fed always likes to keep this bubble
[02:41:26.200 --> 02:41:33.480]  inflated during the election cycle to help the incumbent party do you think that the fed would
[02:41:33.480 --> 02:41:40.280]  make financial decisions purely on the basis of keeping someone like donald trump out of office
[02:41:40.280 --> 02:41:46.680]  and supporting hillary clinton well i think the only basis that they make decisions on is political
[02:41:46.680 --> 02:41:52.680]  i think that determines every move that they make that is the sad reality and janny yellen is a very
[02:41:52.680 --> 02:41:58.360]  partisan democrat she you know believes in big government and the big government policies of
[02:41:58.360 --> 02:42:05.000]  the new deal in the great society she is she wants to see the president's party stay in power i'm
[02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:09.480]  sure she wants to see hillary clinton as our next president and she believes that hillary clinton
[02:42:09.480 --> 02:42:15.640]  will reappoint her as fed chairman so that's what she wants she probably sees herself as a as a
[02:42:15.640 --> 02:42:21.640]  member of the obama administration just the way ben bernacky admitted that he saw himself as a member
[02:42:21.640 --> 02:42:28.840]  of the bush administration when he was uh you know spinning the the economic data when he was uh
[02:42:28.840 --> 02:42:34.600]  chairman of the fed reserve uh so i think she's gonna do whatever she thinks is necessary to make
[02:42:34.600 --> 02:42:40.360]  sure that hillary clinton and that's the most likely democratic nominee is our next president
[02:42:40.360 --> 02:42:44.760]  and you know she wants to keep donald trump or any anybody else with an r in front of their name
[02:42:44.760 --> 02:42:51.480]  from occupying that office okay closing comments just tell people how they can listen to the
[02:42:51.480 --> 02:42:57.320]  podcast and about your website oh i did peter shift show i used to have a radio show that i did

[02:43:50.920 --> 02:43:58.520]  you and a happy new year happy christmas to you there goes peter shift euro pack dot com here in
[02:43:58.520 --> 02:44:02.920]  the final 15 minutes of the alex jones show we're going to cover some more news here which i didn't
[02:44:02.920 --> 02:44:09.240]  get the chance to get to this was a big story yesterday it was a big story for me didn't get a
[02:44:09.240 --> 02:44:17.400]  lot of traction but this is huge e u exploits refugee crisis it created to push draconian plan
[02:44:17.400 --> 02:44:24.760]  for occupying army the european union is exploiting the refugee crisis it helped create remember this
[02:44:24.760 --> 02:44:31.880]  was angela merkel rolling out the red carpet for anyone and everyone who could get here with no
[02:44:31.880 --> 02:44:37.880]  checks whatsoever even on the basis whether they're syrian refugees or not four fifth of the migrants
[02:44:37.880 --> 02:44:43.640]  coming into europe are not from syria and many of those that are from syria or claim to be from
[02:44:43.640 --> 02:44:49.960]  syria have got fake passport so who knows what percentage are genuine legitimate syrian refugees
[02:44:50.600 --> 02:44:57.000]  so they helped create the crisis they rolled out the red carpet now the e u is exploiting that crisis
[02:44:57.000 --> 02:45:03.720]  that they created with their own insane policies to push an occupying army that would have the power
[02:45:03.720 --> 02:45:12.680]  to take control of national borders without the consent of sovereign government so this is a 2500
[02:45:13.240 --> 02:45:22.040]  strong force an armed force of e u troops under e u insignia e u flags we're talking about naval
[02:45:22.040 --> 02:45:27.480]  patrols we're talking about helicopters we're talking about drones that would basically
[02:45:27.480 --> 02:45:33.000]  say to nation states we're taking over your border security and in fact they talk about
[02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:40.120]  internal security as well so basically this is an occupying paramilitary force that would have
[02:45:40.120 --> 02:45:46.280]  the power to take control of a nation's borders without the consent of sovereign governments
[02:45:46.280 --> 02:45:53.000]  those are not my words that was out of the london times reporting on this according to dimitri
[02:45:53.000 --> 02:46:00.840]  avromopoulos european commissioner for migration that the idea represents more europe the new agency
[02:46:00.840 --> 02:46:06.280]  would quote be able to step into ensure action is taken on the ground even where the member state
[02:46:06.280 --> 02:46:12.440]  considers there is no need for additional intervention according to the draft proposal
[02:46:13.160 --> 02:46:20.200]  so this is just riding broth shot over any semblance of national sovereignty in the name
[02:46:20.200 --> 02:46:27.560]  of stopping a migrant crisis that they created with their own policies people that spoke out against
[02:46:27.560 --> 02:46:33.240]  this polish foreign minister whose name i will not even attempt to pronounce but it's in the article
[02:46:33.240 --> 02:46:39.560]  slammed the idea labeling it incompatible with democracy for it to be a structure independent
[02:46:39.560 --> 02:46:47.160]  from nation states is astounding an undemocratic structure reporting to who to no one knows who
[02:46:47.800 --> 02:46:52.920]  said the polish foreign minister nigel forage came out with a speech in the e u parliament the video
[02:46:52.920 --> 02:47:01.320]  is in the article slamming this as did diane james m e p who said quote this is a full frontal attack
[02:47:01.320 --> 02:47:07.640]  on national sovereignty from the e u all pretenses now being discarded and the commission will now
[02:47:07.640 --> 02:47:14.680]  openly act against a member state wishes and operate within its borders without permission so
[02:47:14.680 --> 02:47:20.200]  instead of handing powers back to nation states having completely messed up and deliberately
[02:47:20.200 --> 02:47:27.480]  botched this crisis by inviting in hordes of migrants they're not giving nation states more
[02:47:27.480 --> 02:47:34.920]  powers they're centralizing powers and taking away authority from sovereign nations to create
[02:47:35.800 --> 02:47:41.720]  the embryonic e u army this is what they've pushed up all along this is what bill de burg
[02:47:41.720 --> 02:47:47.160]  which of course created the e u in the first place created the single currency has pushed
[02:47:47.160 --> 02:47:53.560]  they want an e u federal political super state the financial aspect of it is not enough
[02:47:54.360 --> 02:48:00.200]  so they're going to continue to push for more powers by exploiting the crisis they created
[02:48:01.320 --> 02:48:06.840]  to basically have an e u occupying army throughout all these member states absolutely
[02:48:06.840 --> 02:48:15.080]  shocking draft proposal it's received relatively little attention now alex mentioned when he was
[02:48:15.080 --> 02:48:22.760]  on this article out of s s it's a max level article s h t f plan dot com soft targets fb irs
[02:48:22.760 --> 02:48:27.880]  islamic terrorists who plan mass casualty attack on rush hour commuters and college lunchroom
[02:48:28.760 --> 02:48:33.400]  on the very same day as mainstream media outlets argued that the sand burner dino
[02:48:33.400 --> 02:48:38.840]  shooting was probably workplace violence a narrative also repeated by the obama administration
[02:48:38.840 --> 02:48:42.840]  we warned that there were likely more terrorists working in conjunction with ferru can believe
[02:48:42.840 --> 02:48:50.600]  me so now the accomplice enrique marquez has come out this is now public that they plan to
[02:48:50.600 --> 02:48:59.080]  actually go into colleges throw pipe bombs at people go on to the highway state route 91
[02:48:59.080 --> 02:49:05.640]  with pipe bombs during afternoon rush hour and then shoot at law enforcement as an emergency
[02:49:05.640 --> 02:49:12.200]  cruise as they arrived on the scene according to the fbi affidavit so not only was um ferru
[02:49:12.200 --> 02:49:16.840]  planning to attack the christmas party there which had you know offended and triggered him
[02:49:16.840 --> 02:49:23.320]  if he'd not have been stopped by responsible armed men the plan was to go and attack colleges to
[02:49:23.320 --> 02:49:28.680]  attack people on the highway with pipe bombs again absolutely shocking especially given
[02:49:28.680 --> 02:49:34.600]  the context of really good other reports the power of his glory do i hear alex
[02:49:34.600 --> 02:49:44.520]  okay other reports out of missouri of people making bulk purchases of prepaid disposable
[02:49:44.520 --> 02:49:52.040]  cell phones we also had theft of propane tanks in missouri and a report before this back in october
[02:49:52.040 --> 02:49:59.160]  where they actually found buried explosives in a forest in missouri so we've got these strange
[02:49:59.160 --> 02:50:05.160]  middle eastern characters going into walmart buying huge numbers 60 in one instance prepaid
[02:50:05.160 --> 02:50:12.600]  cell phones in the same region we've got propane tanks being stolen some very mysterious goings on
[02:50:13.160 --> 02:50:19.320]  in missouri and people are rightly concerned about it but i guess that means they're islamophobic
[02:50:19.880 --> 02:50:25.480]  of course the neighbors of ferrucan malik didn't report them for suspicious activity despite the
[02:50:25.480 --> 02:50:29.720]  fact they had numerous middle eastern visitors to their apartment they were receiving all these
[02:50:29.720 --> 02:50:35.480]  suspicious packages because they didn't want to racially profile they didn't want to appear
[02:50:35.480 --> 02:50:42.200]  to be politically incorrect if they had a report of those concerns maybe the san bernadino massacre
[02:50:42.200 --> 02:50:47.480]  would have been prevented and now we've got similar concerns in missouri with these strange
[02:50:47.480 --> 02:50:53.160]  purchases cell phones and a theft of propane tanks we'll be back final segment of the alex

[02:54:43.960 --> 02:54:48.760]  politics obviously but it's important that's coming up a lot of other really serious news uh i just
[02:54:48.760 --> 02:54:55.880]  wanted to remind viewers uh and listeners uh out there that we are listener and viewers support it

[02:55:44.600 --> 02:55:48.920]  done prison planet dot tv a lot of folks are taking advantage of this and i want to thank you again
[02:55:48.920 --> 02:55:53.560]  because all the different revenue streams we have any two or three of them wouldn't fund the operation
[02:55:53.560 --> 02:55:59.480]  but five or six of them together do allow us to continue and modestly expand in the face of the
[02:55:59.480 --> 02:56:03.000]  globalist so going back to paul watson and then he's going to throw it to david night to tell us
[02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:07.080]  what's coming up in the fourth hour of overdrive and then i'll be back lord willing don't take it

[02:56:12.840 --> 02:56:19.000]  hosting the sunday show uh now back to paul joseph watson in london okay david night of course
[02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:23.720]  hillary clinton is the clear front runner but you've got some interesting news about bernie sanders
[02:56:23.720 --> 02:56:27.560]  tell us what's coming up on the fourth hour yeah you know paul it's interesting a lot of people
[02:56:27.560 --> 02:56:33.320]  are worried uh is donald trump going to go third party is uh ben karsten going to leave because of
[02:56:33.320 --> 02:56:39.560]  the talk about a brokered convention well now it looks like bernie sanders is absolutely furious
[02:56:39.560 --> 02:56:43.880]  with the dnc of course they have rigged uh the debates you're going to talk about a brokered
[02:56:43.880 --> 02:56:49.640]  convention we got brokered debates and now what they have done and this is exploded today he had
[02:56:49.640 --> 02:56:56.120]  held a press conference uh the dnc has locked them out of getting access to all data now to
[02:56:56.120 --> 02:57:01.720]  understand what happened there was a flaw in the vendor that managed the data for the uh
[02:57:01.720 --> 02:57:05.560]  campaigns of various campaigns they had some of their data that was leaked in october they
[02:57:05.560 --> 02:57:10.600]  complained to the dnc about it some of the hillary clinton campaign information got leaked
[02:57:10.600 --> 02:57:16.040]  to them and the response of the dnc as they're saying is completely over the top the campaign
[02:57:16.040 --> 02:57:21.320]  manager bernie sanders was uh out there talking about now what's interesting about this is that
[02:57:21.320 --> 02:57:27.080]  in both the democrat and the republican campaign people are seeing how manipulated this whole
[02:57:27.080 --> 02:57:31.080]  system is and i think that is one of the best things that can come out of this election uh
[02:57:31.080 --> 02:57:36.520]  they're seeing the corruption uh the uh the tight control that is held by the party leadership how
[02:57:36.520 --> 02:57:42.440]  they manipulate this and of course we've seen um the democrats now really kind of moving towards
[02:57:42.440 --> 02:57:46.200]  socialism maybe he ought to run as a third party candidate maybe ought to run as a socialist and
[02:57:46.200 --> 02:57:51.640]  maybe the gop establishment ought to run as democrats because that's what we saw with this
[02:57:51.640 --> 02:57:57.400]  omnibus bill that comes out you know what we ought to call that is the omnibust bill because it's
[02:57:57.400 --> 02:58:02.440]  all inclusive it funds everything in the universe and we're going bust they just left the tea off
[02:58:02.440 --> 02:58:06.440]  of that that's really what's going on with we're also going to talk about the new star wars film

[03:00:38.440 --> 03:00:43.320]  we went to see it last night actually i'm going to give you a bit of a overall review
[03:00:43.320 --> 03:00:48.840]  i won't give you any spoilers we have a video up that we cut last night as we went out of the
[03:00:48.840 --> 03:00:53.800]  movie theater and we do have some spoiler alerts in that but we let you know when we're going to
[03:00:53.800 --> 03:00:58.840]  tell you something about the plot or something that's interesting with the characters so we
[03:00:58.840 --> 03:01:02.520]  give you plenty of warning at the end when we talk about some of those things but i just want to
[03:01:02.520 --> 03:01:06.760]  talk about some of the general aspects of it we have a special report that was put together
[03:01:06.760 --> 03:01:11.320]  where alex jones is talking about where he broke it down really in the prequels when you look at
[03:01:11.320 --> 03:01:16.520]  the prequels they were they had an interesting plot really it paralleled and he's going to talk
[03:01:16.520 --> 03:01:23.160]  about that paralleled quite a bit what's going on in the real world in real politics basically
[03:01:23.160 --> 03:01:29.480]  creating both sides of a conflict so that an elite can establish themselves and power there
[03:01:29.480 --> 03:01:33.640]  wasn't anything really of that depth in this particular one there were some issues we're
[03:01:33.640 --> 03:01:38.280]  going to talk about that also we're going to talk about the omni bust bill that's really what we
[03:01:38.280 --> 03:01:42.680]  ought to call it let's put that t on the end of it because that's what they're doing they're making
[03:01:42.680 --> 03:01:51.560]  us go bust this is a 1.8 trillion dollar tax and spending bill 1.8 trillion dollar tax and spending
[03:01:51.560 --> 03:01:59.800]  bill it was 2 000 pages long and they introduced it at 2 a.m in the morning on wednesday gave people
[03:01:59.800 --> 03:02:05.480]  about a day and a half to take a look at it and then rushed it through today obama is very pleased
[03:02:05.480 --> 03:02:11.240]  nancy polosi is very pleased she got exactly what she wanted and you know when we look at what's
[03:02:11.240 --> 03:02:18.920]  going on here the way that this is being manipulated it was nancy polosi that used to deliver thousands
[03:02:18.920 --> 03:02:24.360]  of pages uh basic bills waiting to the last minute saying if we don't fund this everything
[03:02:24.360 --> 03:02:28.360]  is going to collapse the government will stop working it's like fine let's do that let's let's
[03:02:28.360 --> 03:02:32.280]  call their bluff on that if they're going to continue to do that in course that tactic
[03:02:32.920 --> 03:02:39.400]  widely criticized by the gop was then adopted by bainer and then we heard bainer criticized
[03:02:39.400 --> 03:02:43.720]  for that and we were told that that's why we needed to have new speaker leadership so they
[03:02:43.720 --> 03:02:48.360]  could get things done in orderly fashion so they didn't do this massive data dump at the last minute
[03:02:48.360 --> 03:02:54.120]  so they could put all of this stuff in that people don't really want but that's not the way they roll
[03:02:54.120 --> 03:02:58.440]  they're going to do this with the trans-pacific and the transatlantic partnership as well that
[03:02:58.440 --> 03:03:03.480]  thing is so large nobody has had time to truly vet that yet and i predict that this is something
[03:03:03.480 --> 03:03:07.480]  that's going to be rammed through during the holidays it's going to be rammed through at a
[03:03:07.480 --> 03:03:11.880]  time when nobody is paying attention and that's precisely what we've seen happen with this particular
[03:03:11.880 --> 03:03:16.440]  bill we're going to break down the many many things that it funds you will not believe what
[03:03:16.440 --> 03:03:21.640]  they funded on this and we're also going to talk about bernie sanders should he go third party his
[03:03:21.640 --> 03:03:26.600]  campaign is absolutely furious i looked at this i watched the press conference that his campaign
[03:03:26.600 --> 03:03:31.240]  manager had let me give you some of the phrases that were thrown out there he talked about the dnc
[03:03:31.240 --> 03:03:37.320]  being heavy-handed said this was unprecedented he used the phrase dirty tricks he said their data is
[03:03:37.320 --> 03:03:43.080]  being stolen by the dnc he said they're holding our data hostage and they pointed out that they
[03:03:43.080 --> 03:03:49.560]  had shown this kind of data breach back in october let me explain something to the american people
[03:03:49.560 --> 03:03:53.720]  it doesn't matter whether you're republican or democrat those two parties have colluded together
[03:03:53.720 --> 03:03:58.280]  to shut the political process down for any outsiders people like donald trump people like
[03:03:58.280 --> 03:04:02.040]  bernie sanders whether or not you agree with their policies whether or not you agree with these
[03:04:02.040 --> 03:04:07.480]  candidates they are both people who did not come through and get the blessing of the establishment
[03:04:07.480 --> 03:04:11.560]  other candidates have come in the establishment is closing ranks on this that's why there's been so
[03:04:11.560 --> 03:04:17.000]  much talk openly in the gop about a brokered convention they control access to the data
[03:04:17.000 --> 03:04:21.400]  they control access to the debates they've done that to shut out third parties for a very long time
[03:04:21.400 --> 03:04:28.040]  now they're using it internally to shut out anybody that isn't really vetted for the major
[03:04:28.040 --> 03:04:31.880]  parties because there is only one party in washington you have to understand that there's
[03:04:31.880 --> 03:04:37.400]  only one party and when you look at this budget deal when you look at the history of the way
[03:04:37.400 --> 03:04:42.520]  the speakers have worked from nancy polosi to john bainer to paul ryanow you start to understand
[03:04:42.520 --> 03:04:48.920]  why they control this so carefully they both have the same exact agenda stay tuned we're
[03:04:48.920 --> 03:05:04.200]  going to be right back joe banks here with info wars dot com article up by paul joseph watson canadian

[03:11:07.400 --> 03:11:12.600]  advance i enjoyed star wars when it first came out but i'm not that big a fan i was curious
[03:11:12.600 --> 03:11:17.000]  and i looked and i found several places where i could still get in because as much demand as
[03:11:17.000 --> 03:11:21.720]  there's been i've seen that there's been over 100 million dollars in picket pre-sales as much
[03:11:21.720 --> 03:11:26.120]  demand as it is they've added more screens that's what the free market does you know hollywood
[03:11:26.120 --> 03:11:30.840]  kind of understands the free market uh when it comes to their own money but they don't really
[03:11:30.840 --> 03:11:37.560]  appreciate it comes to your business your money now we went to see it last night and i would say
[03:11:37.560 --> 03:11:42.840]  when i'm not going to give away anything without i'll just tell you that in terms of the movie it
[03:11:42.840 --> 03:11:49.960]  was almost exactly a remake of the very first star wars what they call now episode four uh
[03:11:49.960 --> 03:11:55.880]  just things were changed but done really really well it was very enjoyable as a popcorn film as a
[03:11:55.880 --> 03:12:01.320]  blockbuster film uh extremely well made film but everything has just changed a little bit you've
[03:12:01.320 --> 03:12:06.840]  all seen the droid going around so that's the kind of thing they replace r2d2 with a droid that has
[03:12:06.840 --> 03:12:11.960]  a rolling bottom and a stationary head you know that type of thing so that kind of runs all the way
[03:12:11.960 --> 03:12:17.160]  through all the different archetypes the storyline is essentially the same they just played musical
[03:12:17.160 --> 03:12:21.560]  chairs with the characters the big there's not really anything geopolitical in it we're going to
[03:12:21.560 --> 03:12:27.720]  talk about the geopolitical aspects of the prequels and we've got a report of alex breaking
[03:12:27.720 --> 03:12:31.800]  that down and he did that well before the mainstream media is doing it now people understand
[03:12:31.800 --> 03:12:37.560]  that false flag narrative and now they see the parallels in it but alex broke that down and
[03:12:37.560 --> 03:12:41.560]  we're going to play that report here in just a moment i will say this is not a spoiler alert
[03:12:41.560 --> 03:12:46.280]  this is something you'll see from the very beginning what they've done is a role reversal
[03:12:46.280 --> 03:12:51.400]  with the main characters in the film the male and the female character they've made the male
[03:12:51.400 --> 03:12:58.760]  character very empathetic very sensitive and really not much of a fighter whereas the female
[03:12:58.760 --> 03:13:04.280]  is really a superwoman and this is really pushing this narrative that we see coming from hollywood
[03:13:04.280 --> 03:13:09.800]  all the time it coincides incidentally and coincidentally some would say with pushing women
[03:13:09.800 --> 03:13:16.440]  in combat you have to ask yourself is art imitating life or is hollywood pushing an agenda along with
[03:13:16.440 --> 03:13:21.800]  the government of course we know the government has used hollywood to press all kinds of agendas to
[03:13:21.800 --> 03:13:27.640]  do predictive programming for us that is certainly something that runs through this i would say the
[03:13:27.640 --> 03:13:33.560]  best uh she's also the best actor but she is certainly the strongest character uh in this
[03:13:33.560 --> 03:13:39.640]  movie let's go to alex jones breaking down the original series in this because although this
[03:13:39.640 --> 03:13:45.480]  one looks really really good it doesn't look like a a computer game especially when you've seen
[03:13:45.480 --> 03:13:50.120]  computer games technology increase you go back and you look at the prequels they really looked
[03:13:50.120 --> 03:13:55.640]  starting to look like a very cheap uh video game but they did have more interesting storyline in it
[03:13:55.640 --> 03:14:01.000]  than this one does as i said this one is simply uh an action blockbuster film not a lot of depth to
[03:14:01.000 --> 03:14:05.560]  it it's very much like the very first one but alex is going to break down what was really behind
[03:14:05.560 --> 03:14:12.760]  the prequels here's that report well the long anticipated star wars movie is finally in theaters
[03:14:12.760 --> 03:14:19.080]  and you know without question the star wars movies have had a huge impact on popular culture
[03:14:19.080 --> 03:14:25.240]  and george lucas the creator of star wars says that deep down everyone knows that the greatest
[03:14:25.240 --> 03:14:31.080]  threat to liberty isn't the average criminal on the street but the monolithic all-powerful state
[03:14:31.640 --> 03:14:38.920]  the new world order the human desire to resist tyranny is one of the strongest drives we have
[03:14:38.920 --> 03:14:45.640]  george lucas did a really good job of portraying that in his movies for example star wars episode
[03:14:45.640 --> 03:14:51.720]  three the revenge of the sith well it's about a sci-fi as you can get but it mirrors reality
[03:14:51.720 --> 03:14:59.880]  and it details the psychology of government sponsored terrorism as a tool of empire emperor palpatine
[03:15:00.680 --> 03:15:06.600]  was a little known senator from naboo small planet he finances terrorists to attack the
[03:15:06.600 --> 03:15:12.760]  planet and then he plays victim and says says that the pacifist republic isn't doing enough to help
[03:15:12.760 --> 03:15:19.000]  him with the terrorist invasion the trade federation invasion who even speak in chinese accent it's
[03:15:19.000 --> 03:15:27.320]  all geopolitical he then goes and complains and catapults himself in the crisis into the role of
[03:15:27.320 --> 03:15:32.440]  chancellor because you know he was the victim but now he he demanded something be done he'd been a
[03:15:32.440 --> 03:15:40.200]  pacifist previously now he's chancellor episode two launches terror attacks all over the galaxy
[03:15:40.200 --> 03:15:45.240]  with groups he's secretly financing through his backers in the trade federation he turns around
[03:15:45.240 --> 03:15:49.880]  double crosses in the end so basically in the end they knock out all of the people that backed him
[03:15:49.880 --> 03:15:53.960]  which always happens nazi germany soviet russia malish china learned from history
[03:15:55.080 --> 03:16:03.000]  then in episode so he uses that to build up the power of the empire in episode two and now he's
[03:16:03.000 --> 03:16:08.600]  got this big imperial army but it's not imperial yet but it's it's the storm troopers the outfits
[03:16:08.600 --> 03:16:13.880]  the weapons systems to counter this outside threat run by count dooku that the some have been lauten
[03:16:13.880 --> 03:16:20.600]  guy that actually works for him and they meet the secret now in episode three he launches an attack
[03:16:20.600 --> 03:16:27.000]  on the imperial capital himself he launches an attack on new york and then he gets captured and
[03:16:27.000 --> 03:16:31.960]  and then he sets up count dooku to get killed and then he seduces with the dark side anakin
[03:16:31.960 --> 03:16:37.400]  skywalker to make him darth vader and in the end he then sets up after he has the police state in
[03:16:37.400 --> 03:16:42.360]  place he sets up the jedi and says they're terrorist and has the anti-terror forces going
[03:16:42.360 --> 03:16:48.360]  and wipe him out and then he says he's launching a global uh intergalactic war uh to bring peace
[03:16:49.640 --> 03:16:55.560]  now the media could could not understand wait and they actually wrote articles emperor palpatine's
[03:16:55.560 --> 03:17:04.200]  attacking himself it makes no sense adults cannot understand children level ideas okay child level
[03:17:04.200 --> 03:17:11.560]  ideas child level now star wars the force awakens is the new film now in theaters this
[03:17:11.560 --> 03:17:17.880]  time produced by disney and directed by jj abrams and it continues the cinematic saga of an inter
[03:17:17.880 --> 03:17:24.600]  planetary civilization struggles with galactic war and tyranny the plot of the new star wars
[03:17:24.600 --> 03:17:32.120]  movie frightening resembles modern day america as global warfare driven by a planetary empire
[03:17:32.120 --> 03:17:40.120]  thrust the world into a militarized police state once again science fiction mirrors reality info
[03:17:40.120 --> 03:17:48.040]  wars dot com the great report by bernard green using alex james's breakdown and analysis of what
[03:17:48.040 --> 03:17:54.040]  was going on and of course who would imagine that we've got a government that creates and finances
[03:17:54.040 --> 03:18:00.440]  terrorist surrogates so they can then establish their authoritarian government on top of that
[03:18:00.440 --> 03:18:05.320]  that was what was really excellent about the prequels again this one however begins a new
[03:18:05.320 --> 03:18:12.440]  tradition the director did a great job of recreating the very first star wars but again it's it's
[03:18:12.440 --> 03:18:19.080]  got a lot of women in combat which is really the key action figure they've they've shifted
[03:18:19.080 --> 03:18:23.800]  things around so luke skywalker is now female essentially folks that's what they've done in
[03:18:23.800 --> 03:18:29.720]  terms of shifting characters and you know what they're doing with the war on terror running
[03:18:29.720 --> 03:18:34.680]  both sides of this we reported on this over and over again here at info wars they're also doing
[03:18:34.680 --> 03:18:39.960]  when it comes to washington that's what's behind this budget deal and we're going to break that down
[03:18:39.960 --> 03:18:46.040]  in a great deal of detail as well you can see however how the close establishment of elites
[03:18:46.040 --> 03:18:51.560]  in both parties have exactly the same agenda it's a very authoritarian agenda when we look
[03:18:51.560 --> 03:18:56.840]  at what they're pushing on this bill that just got run through that they gave nobody any time to
[03:18:56.840 --> 03:19:01.560]  take a look at we're going to play some comments from senator sessions he really breaks this down
[03:19:01.560 --> 03:19:07.160]  I really appreciate his honesty he's more than anybody else he took a look at what was behind
[03:19:07.160 --> 03:19:12.920]  the trans-pacific transatlantic partnerships when they were running through the tpa the
[03:19:13.720 --> 03:19:19.960]  fast-track authorization for this subverting the constitutional process of review the constitutional
[03:19:19.960 --> 03:19:25.800]  process of approval by the senate for treaties let's not call it a treaty let's just run through a
[03:19:25.800 --> 03:19:31.640]  simple process where there is just a simple majority in both houses we won't have any debate
[03:19:31.640 --> 03:19:37.560]  we won't have any amendments offered boy that sounds like star wars doesn't it yeah and you
[03:19:37.560 --> 03:19:41.960]  know what they're trying to do they're trying to establish a global dictatorship so we're
[03:19:41.960 --> 03:19:46.200]  going to break down what's behind this what's behind the betrayal of the american people by

[03:24:20.920 --> 03:24:25.800]  bust bill put the tea on it because they're going to bust america with this they're going to bust us
[03:24:25.800 --> 03:24:31.160]  financially they're going to bust our borders they're going to bust our privacy it has so many
[03:24:31.160 --> 03:24:36.520]  different aspects in it funding plan parenthood a hundred percent everything is in this a 1.8
[03:24:36.520 --> 03:24:43.240]  trillion dollar bill now i was interested to see the reactions of rushland ball it was his commentary
[03:24:43.240 --> 03:24:49.240]  on it that was uh pointed to by the drudge report this is mr gop and what he had said was why don't
[03:24:49.240 --> 03:24:53.800]  we just disband the gop if they're going to do this kind of thing let me read you his comment here
[03:24:54.360 --> 03:24:58.760]  he said this was out and out in our face lying and we're going to play the clip from senator
[03:24:58.760 --> 03:25:03.880]  sessions where he says it's exactly the same thing he said we had we understood the problems of the
[03:25:03.880 --> 03:25:09.480]  border we thought maybe we had a chance with this new leadership we made some improvements to try to
[03:25:09.480 --> 03:25:14.440]  pull some things back to try to stop some things obama is doing those were shut down we got word
[03:25:14.440 --> 03:25:18.280]  that there was going to be some things put in there for the corporations and then we got assurances
[03:25:18.280 --> 03:25:22.840]  that those were not in there he goes they lied to our face lied to the face of the senators not just
[03:25:22.840 --> 03:25:30.200]  to the voters gave them these assurances and then senator sessions says and then at 2am 2am in the
[03:25:30.200 --> 03:25:35.560]  morning they dropped this bill on us and he goes it's all there they just lied to us and then they
[03:25:35.560 --> 03:25:40.040]  give them absolutely no time holding under their head say if you don't do this we're going to shut
[03:25:40.040 --> 03:25:46.440]  the government down and we're going to blame you for this a 2000 page bill 1.8 trillion dollars
[03:25:46.440 --> 03:25:53.720]  worth of spending that's what we come to expect from our new speaker and of course he got a lot a
[03:25:53.720 --> 03:25:58.600]  lot of cooperation from all the republicans so rush says this was out and out lying in our face
[03:25:58.600 --> 03:26:03.320]  from the campaigns to individual statements made about the philosophical approach republicans had
[03:26:03.320 --> 03:26:08.280]  to all this spending there is no republican party he said you know we don't even need a republican
[03:26:08.280 --> 03:26:14.200]  party if they're going to do this i agree i agree you know just elect democrats disband the republican
[03:26:14.200 --> 03:26:19.800]  party let the democrats run it because that's what's happening anyway and the same republican leaders
[03:26:19.800 --> 03:26:25.480]  doing this can't for the life of them figure out by donald trump has all the support he has they
[03:26:25.480 --> 03:26:31.880]  really can't figure this out now let me read you something else that rush said in this which i think
[03:26:31.880 --> 03:26:38.920]  is very enlightening at the beginning of the transcript he says it's not all republican
[03:26:38.920 --> 03:26:45.240]  caving understand he says a lot of it is republican fealty and loyalty to some of their donors yeah
[03:26:45.240 --> 03:26:49.400]  okay think about that whole that word fealty there's a lot of truth in that i don't know
[03:26:50.120 --> 03:26:54.680]  if rush is criticizing this or not i'd have to go back and listen to his tone
[03:26:55.400 --> 03:27:01.240]  but he twice out these people have donated money and so they expect these favors back so this is
[03:27:01.240 --> 03:27:08.120]  fealty fealty remember where that comes from okay that's the essence of crony capitalism
[03:27:08.120 --> 03:27:15.320]  fealty is a medieval term a feudalism term and that's what they are pushing us back into is a
[03:27:15.320 --> 03:27:20.680]  kind of global feudalism when they negotiate these trade partnerships they're selling this
[03:27:20.680 --> 03:27:26.840]  is free trade it's not free trade folks it's not free trade this is a 21st century feudalism
[03:27:27.400 --> 03:27:31.960]  they negotiated this without our elected leaders without any representation our elected leaders
[03:27:31.960 --> 03:27:36.360]  were not allowed to talk about this we only had one with the courage to talk about it and that was
[03:27:36.360 --> 03:27:42.280]  senator sessions this is something that is sold to us that they they send their representatives
[03:27:42.280 --> 03:27:47.480]  out to negotiate this bill secretly they tell the our elected representatives they can't look at it
[03:27:47.480 --> 03:27:53.720]  they can't talk about it and they have absolutely nothing to say about it and they were fine fine
[03:27:53.720 --> 03:27:59.000]  to just abdicate their power to these corporate lobbyists who are writing this and it's about
[03:27:59.000 --> 03:28:05.000]  far more than free trade this impacts the freedom of the internet it impacts so many different
[03:28:05.000 --> 03:28:08.360]  areas we've talked about these deals over and over again but what you have to understand is how
[03:28:08.360 --> 03:28:14.280]  they surrendered their sovereignty to this to say that we are going to let the corporations
[03:28:14.280 --> 03:28:17.960]  dictate to us what we can and cannot do they're going to write the agreement they're going to
[03:28:17.960 --> 03:28:22.840]  tell us what we can say about it and what we can say about it that's how they have kowtowed to
[03:28:22.840 --> 03:28:29.640]  these people but it really is a kind of feudalism a kind of fealty understand that this is a feudal
[03:28:29.640 --> 03:28:37.240]  term a fealty was an oath that was sworn by a vassal to their liege lord okay it also referred
[03:28:37.240 --> 03:28:44.440]  to the duties that were incumbent upon that vassal to their liege lord hmm kind of sounds like
[03:28:44.440 --> 03:28:50.920]  star wars doesn't it okay guess what you got people at the top of the democrat and the republican
[03:28:50.920 --> 03:28:56.920]  party that belong to the sith if you want to continue the analogy that's exactly what's going
[03:28:56.920 --> 03:29:02.200]  on folks it happens when they are setting up these governmental structures that are created out of
[03:29:02.200 --> 03:29:07.640]  their own chaos that they create their own crises that they create they create these structures
[03:29:07.640 --> 03:29:12.280]  they'll create an economic crisis and say well we have to have free trade or you know we're going
[03:29:12.280 --> 03:29:17.320]  to plunge the world into depression they're going to do this with war with terrorism
[03:29:17.320 --> 03:29:20.760]  scaring people setting up the police state that's precisely what they're going to do
[03:29:20.760 --> 03:29:26.280]  and when we come back we're going to tell you some of the details of this job and we're also going
[03:29:26.280 --> 03:29:34.520]  to point out what uh who one of the major sith lords is george soros pushing now for europe to do
[03:29:34.520 --> 03:29:46.520]  even more in terms of bringing in migrants we'll be right back
[03:29:46.520 --> 03:29:57.080]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[03:30:39.080 --> 03:30:44.200]  and he has been encouraged by the interest democrats have shown in the idea as well
[03:30:44.200 --> 03:30:49.560]  menweller told jason canc in a recent radio interview that he had watched the erosion of free

[03:33:12.520 --> 03:33:17.800]  the signals broadcast 24 hours a day through all this media just become aware of it and they'll say
[03:33:17.800 --> 03:33:25.800]  there's nothing going on and i want to say put on these glasses or start cuing concrete
[03:33:28.600 --> 03:33:35.800]  they have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders they have recruited the rich and the
[03:33:35.800 --> 03:33:42.600]  powerful and they have blinded us to the truth the question is do we all work for central bankers
[03:33:42.600 --> 03:33:49.240]  that's what i want to address to our guests tonight our impulses are being redirected we are living
[03:33:49.240 --> 03:33:56.440]  in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep an estimated 50 to 70 million

[03:34:18.920 --> 03:34:25.960]  show that by the year 2025 not only america but the entire planet will be under the protection
[03:34:25.960 --> 03:34:32.120]  and the dominion of this power alliance the gains have been substantial both for ourselves
[03:34:32.120 --> 03:34:35.720]  and for you the human power elite
[03:34:40.600 --> 03:34:44.360]  and for the first time in all of human history
[03:34:46.760 --> 03:34:53.800]  mankind is politically awakened that's a total new reality i've got one that can see
[03:34:54.760 --> 03:35:01.400]  we can't be the only ones who can see unfortunately you've grown up hearing voices that incessantly
[03:35:01.400 --> 03:35:06.360]  warn of government is nothing more than some separate sinister entity that's got at the root
[03:35:06.360 --> 03:35:15.560]  of all our problems it's a new morning in america fresh vital the old cynicism is gone we have faith
[03:35:15.560 --> 03:35:24.120]  in our leaders we're optimistic as to what becomes of it all it really boils down to our ability to
[03:35:24.120 --> 03:35:34.920]  accept we don't need pessimism i have two words for you predator drones
[03:35:37.560 --> 03:35:43.160]  we will never see it coming don't predict the first guy who uses a second amendment weapon
[03:35:43.160 --> 03:35:47.320]  to bring a drone down that's been hovering over his house is going to be a folk hero in this
[03:35:47.320 --> 03:35:55.240]  i'm nice and there is a single broadcast every second of every day through our television
[03:35:55.240 --> 03:36:02.200]  sets i'm just trying to warn you folks the television is a giant led weapon system it's
[03:36:02.200 --> 03:36:08.200]  so advanced they got a monkey farm in bass drop folks they do all sorts of testing on great apes
[03:36:08.200 --> 03:36:12.440]  rhesus monkeys all nine yards and they go oh you didn't see this and punch a button into beating
[03:36:12.440 --> 03:36:15.800]  hundreds of monkeys wires in their brains with television sets brainwashing them
[03:36:15.800 --> 03:36:24.200]  well i ever have to do is be famous people watch me and i love me you can have a little
[03:36:24.200 --> 03:36:29.880]  taste of that good life too now i know you want it hell everybody does do it to your own kind
[03:36:30.920 --> 03:36:37.320]  what's the threat we all sell out every day might as well be on the winning team the real man of
[03:36:37.320 --> 03:36:43.720]  the world have to stand up and say i have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass
[03:36:43.720 --> 03:36:53.560]  and i'm all out of bubblegum time to take a stand boys you know what you got a little courage
[03:36:53.560 --> 03:37:02.600]  stand up for yourself waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the
[03:37:02.600 --> 03:37:20.440]  front lines of the info war the afterwinners give a press conference and how to buy a sailboat
[03:37:20.440 --> 03:37:24.920]  and again the rich metaphors and that john carpenter film they live and there's a lot of
[03:37:24.920 --> 03:37:30.600]  rich metaphors and star wars because we're just talking about this the the fact that we have the
[03:37:30.600 --> 03:37:37.320]  republicans and the democrats and leadership joining together to back exactly the same agenda
[03:37:37.320 --> 03:37:43.480]  as rush limbaugh pointed out it dredge picked up on the wording where he said disband the GOP and
[03:37:43.480 --> 03:37:47.800]  yeah we don't really need them they're really redundant i mean the GOP has become the democrats
[03:37:47.800 --> 03:37:52.600]  and the democrats are starting to move towards socialism so where is the party that represents
[03:37:52.600 --> 03:37:59.080]  america that is the secret of donald trump's success what the republican establishment won't
[03:37:59.080 --> 03:38:05.800]  do and let's look at who they represent george soros is now pushing open immigration in europe
[03:38:05.800 --> 03:38:11.400]  as he has in america and this is another link that i believe was on dredge this is from sputnik
[03:38:11.400 --> 03:38:15.720]  international point out american business magnet george soros is making every effort to boost the
[03:38:15.720 --> 03:38:20.440]  refugee flow to europe by encouraging asylum seekers to travel to the continent and urging
[03:38:20.440 --> 03:38:27.080]  european leaders to fork out the money now this is a historian and a strategic risk consultant f
[03:38:27.080 --> 03:38:32.680]  william engdahl and he writes since john d rockefeller was advised to protect his wealth from
[03:38:32.680 --> 03:38:38.280]  government taxation by creating a tax exempt philanthropic foundation 1913 foundations
[03:38:38.280 --> 03:38:44.040]  have been used by american oligarchs to disguise a world of dirty deeds under the cover of quote
[03:38:44.040 --> 03:38:50.520]  doing good for mankind known by the moniker philanthropy for mankind loving and he says
[03:38:50.520 --> 03:38:55.720]  this is a recent thing on new eastern outlook and he points out that george soros is a prominent
[03:38:55.720 --> 03:39:01.080]  international supporter of democratic ideals and causes of course no exception to the rule that's
[03:39:01.080 --> 03:39:06.840]  the way they mask it but he truly is one of the sith lords and i think when we look at this
[03:39:06.840 --> 03:39:11.800]  this rush transcript the thing that stuck out to me was not the word disband as in disband the
[03:39:11.800 --> 03:39:18.040]  gop because they're redundant okay there's just a single party there but this word fealty and as
[03:39:18.040 --> 03:39:24.120]  i pointed out it's something you swear to your liege lord and of course it is also the name for
[03:39:24.120 --> 03:39:30.360]  the obligation that you have once you become a vassal of that liege lord to do whatever they
[03:39:30.360 --> 03:39:34.920]  wish to do that's what we have to understand we have to understand that there is no difference
[03:39:34.920 --> 03:39:40.200]  between paul ryan and nancy polosi between paul ryan and john bainer between john bainer and
[03:39:40.200 --> 03:39:46.040]  nancy polosi they all represent exactly the same thing in response to this we see the white house
[03:39:46.040 --> 03:39:50.280]  saying the us spending bill appears to meet obama's priorities yet meets all of his priorities it
[03:39:50.280 --> 03:39:56.600]  funds obama care it funds his open immigration it funds everything that he wants even the climate
[03:39:56.600 --> 03:40:00.200]  deal that just came out this last weekend they signed on to this in paris and as i pointed
[03:40:00.200 --> 03:40:07.080]  out the other day we had a us u.s a republican senator from wyoming john barasso bravely saying
[03:40:07.080 --> 03:40:13.400]  congress will have a say well they've had their say they have basically funded it for obama
[03:40:13.960 --> 03:40:17.880]  they could have shut this down this is the green climate fund that was really the only thing that
[03:40:17.880 --> 03:40:24.680]  was agreed to he wanted a authoritarian international mechanism that could measure and enforce this
[03:40:24.680 --> 03:40:30.120]  with penalties they didn't get that what they did get however was a massive transfer of wealth
[03:40:30.680 --> 03:40:35.320]  to the third world and that wealth is not really going to be transferred to the third world because
[03:40:35.320 --> 03:40:41.080]  it's going to be transferred via intermediaries people like george soros people like bill gates
[03:40:41.080 --> 03:40:46.440]  and al gore are going to be the intermediaries guess how much of that money is going to pass
[03:40:46.440 --> 03:40:51.560]  through their fingers and how much of it is going to stop at their fingers most of it will stop there
[03:40:51.560 --> 03:40:56.520]  so they they funded obama care they funded planned parenthood they funded the climate deal they have
[03:40:56.520 --> 03:41:03.800]  funded open borders sanctuary cities 1.8 trillion dollars 2000 pages and bainer bainer yeah it's
[03:41:03.800 --> 03:41:08.760]  just like bainer paul ryan dumps this on to them in the dead of night doesn't give them any time
[03:41:08.760 --> 03:41:13.080]  tells them they have to sign this or they're going to shut the government down i want to play you
[03:41:13.080 --> 03:41:18.280]  what senator sessions said because he is great at exposing the lies here's what he had to say
[03:41:19.800 --> 03:41:25.720]  this bill explains why republican and democratic voters are an open rebellion
[03:41:26.840 --> 03:41:34.280]  as former speaker of the house newt gingrich said recently open rebellion they elect people
[03:41:34.280 --> 03:41:40.920]  that they believe they're going to take action to protect their security their jobs their wages
[03:41:40.920 --> 03:41:48.360]  and what do they get bill that is worse than current law goes in the opposite direction
[03:41:48.920 --> 03:41:57.960]  if i'd heard this might be under consideration and so i asked about it i said american people don't
[03:41:57.960 --> 03:42:03.960]  want a four-fold increase in immigration i know there's some special interest pushing for this
[03:42:03.960 --> 03:42:12.520]  i've heard that tell me it's not so and i was told it wasn't so but last night this morning at two
[03:42:12.520 --> 03:42:18.760]  a.m i guess when the bill was produced it's in there at a time when hundreds of thousands of
[03:42:18.760 --> 03:42:26.680]  criminal aliens who by law should be deported or on our streets we've had hearings on this
[03:42:26.680 --> 03:42:32.520]  criminal aliens are killing innocent americans numerous foreign-born individuals are implicated
[03:42:32.520 --> 03:42:38.680]  in terrorism tens of thousands of aliens from central america continue to stream across our
[03:42:38.680 --> 03:42:44.360]  southern border countless americans are being replaced by foreign workers and forced to train
[03:42:44.360 --> 03:42:51.480]  their replacements and millions of other americans just struggling to get by we put in language that
[03:42:51.480 --> 03:43:01.640]  would prevent illegal aliens illegal aliens from receiving tax credits it is unbelievable and they
[03:43:01.640 --> 03:43:07.080]  file some sort of tax return and they don't pay taxes because their income is low but they get a
[03:43:07.080 --> 03:43:12.520]  tax credit based on children that are not even in the country wow you hear that i mean how abusive
[03:43:12.520 --> 03:43:23.720]  is that so all these were rejected by the bill supporters but industries request for more foreign
[03:43:23.720 --> 03:43:33.240]  workers that that was granted 83 percent of the electorate want immigration either frozen or reduced
[03:43:34.280 --> 03:43:39.800]  and the republican led congress is about to deliver the president a fourfold increase
[03:43:40.360 --> 03:43:46.280]  in one of the most controversial foreign worker programs that we have this ominous bill
[03:43:46.840 --> 03:43:52.920]  approves the president's request for increased refugee admissions allowing him to bring in
[03:43:52.920 --> 03:44:00.200]  as many refugees as he wants and he can bring them from anywhere he wants and allow them access
[03:44:00.200 --> 03:44:07.560]  to unlimited welfare and entitlements at the taxpayer expense which is not scored as a cost
[03:44:08.200 --> 03:44:16.040]  under this bill it would ensure that at least 170 000 green cards that means permanent residency
[03:44:16.040 --> 03:44:25.160]  with a guaranteed path to citizenship refugee and assaili approvals or will be issued to migrants
[03:44:25.160 --> 03:44:32.280]  from muslim countries just over the next 12 months this congress has chosen to make things worse
[03:44:32.840 --> 03:44:38.440]  they have chosen to make things worse they have chosen to out democrat the democrats
[03:44:39.080 --> 03:44:44.200]  and as brightbart has pointed out he gave a figure of 170 000 green cards they pointed out
[03:44:44.200 --> 03:44:51.320]  300 000 visas for muslim migrants in just one year they also pointed out that paul ryan and of course
[03:44:51.320 --> 03:44:56.840]  he has a long long history this isn't any surprise that he would support open borders he has a long
[03:44:56.840 --> 03:45:01.400]  long history of doing this they point out that he bills a border fence around his mansion but he
[03:45:01.400 --> 03:45:07.320]  doesn't fund border fences and the omnibus bill make sure you put that t in there because they
[03:45:07.320 --> 03:45:13.080]  are bankrupting us folks they are trying to fund everything in the world we are now the empire that
[03:45:13.080 --> 03:45:19.400]  tries to control the world we are the empire that is pushing for a global governance that's
[03:45:19.400 --> 03:45:24.440]  really the that main push is coming out of america that's where the uh the elites are really focused
[03:45:24.440 --> 03:45:28.600]  here of course it also funds all the sanctuary cities it doesn't do anything to push back against
[03:45:28.600 --> 03:45:32.360]  any of this we're going to play a report here from uh john bount before we get to that let me
[03:45:32.360 --> 03:45:37.800]  just sum this up for you here's what cnn how they summarize this congress approved a 1.1 trillion
[03:45:37.800 --> 03:45:42.680]  dollar spending package some people put it at 1.8 trillion that's uh other people have scored
[03:45:42.680 --> 03:45:48.440]  it see they have put this 2 000 pages out here so quickly that you can't eat they don't even know
[03:45:48.440 --> 03:45:53.880]  exactly what's in it but it is well over a trillion dollars uh it avoids a government shutdown isn't
[03:45:53.880 --> 03:45:58.600]  that great and it funds the federal agencies through next fall because that is the only thing
[03:45:58.600 --> 03:46:03.960]  that is important the only thing that is important is that the government continues that we keep the
[03:46:03.960 --> 03:46:08.600]  government salaries and the government federal agencies safe you know like the federal agency
[03:46:08.600 --> 03:46:14.200]  the f a a that is threatening to find you and your children twenty seven thousand dollars if you fly
[03:46:14.200 --> 03:46:20.520]  your toy model airplane outside of the house before you register it with them that goes on to affect
[03:46:20.520 --> 03:46:25.880]  december 21st absolutely outrageous the excessive fines that they put in this and of course that's
[03:46:25.880 --> 03:46:30.120]  a civil fine you won't get a day in court they will just assess that to you twenty seven and a
[03:46:30.120 --> 03:46:35.880]  half thousand dollars and they are going to require if you that's just for not registering it that
[03:46:35.880 --> 03:46:40.520]  doesn't mean that you did anything wrong you just took it outside and flew it in your front yard
[03:46:40.520 --> 03:46:44.920]  if they were to see that they granted themselves the authority to do that so we need to keep those
[03:46:44.920 --> 03:46:49.800]  kind of federal agencies running at all costs no matter what happens so we need to keep that going
[03:46:49.800 --> 03:46:53.880]  need to keep the government running now this is what happened they said the house overwhelmingly
[03:46:53.880 --> 03:47:00.440]  approved the measure in a surprise 316 to 113 vote it was a major victory for the new speaker
[03:47:00.440 --> 03:47:08.920]  paul ryan 150 republicans a majority of the house gop conference backed paul ryan john bainer rarely
[03:47:08.920 --> 03:47:13.000]  got that kind of backing from republicans on a spending bill when he ran the house they say
[03:47:13.000 --> 03:47:19.240]  this is cnn talking obama called ryan after the vote to thank him thank you paul ryan for doing
[03:47:19.240 --> 03:47:25.720]  exactly what i want to do this is just unbelievable how these people work together and of course the
[03:47:25.720 --> 03:47:31.800]  conservative house freedom caucus that we had pinned some hopes on hoping that it was going to
[03:47:31.800 --> 03:47:37.400]  be the organization that would push someone forward like daniel webster to stand up against
[03:47:37.400 --> 03:47:43.400]  doing business this way that would stand up to the single washington party they caved on the
[03:47:43.400 --> 03:47:49.960]  speaker race and they caved on this vote as well and a kansas congressman tim fuel's camp if i'm
[03:47:49.960 --> 03:47:54.920]  pronouncing his name correctly says that this is a christmas present to donald trump because it
[03:47:54.920 --> 03:48:00.840]  represents another example of a republican establishment cutting deals with democrats that
[03:48:00.840 --> 03:48:05.560]  is precisely what this is uh they say indeed passage was a win for house democrat leader
[03:48:05.560 --> 03:48:10.120]  nancy polosi who took several last minute steps to assuage liberals and her congress
[03:48:10.120 --> 03:48:13.880]  who threatened to torpedo the bill yeah don't worry we're going to get everything we want
[03:48:13.880 --> 03:48:18.920]  let's play john balance report i want to uh let him break this down for you and of course these
[03:48:18.920 --> 03:48:24.760]  details are going to continue to unfold this is what happened while you were sleeping dreaming of
[03:48:24.760 --> 03:48:30.680]  family and friends gathering for the upcoming holiday season yet another treasonous move from
[03:48:30.680 --> 03:48:36.760]  our corporatized politicians and their new world order agendas act of war against the american
[03:48:36.760 --> 03:48:46.040]  people act of war against the american people come on well i'll explain why but first how
[03:48:46.040 --> 03:48:55.240]  destructive is the 2242 page omni bus package led by obama sycophant paul ryan breitbart reports
[03:48:55.240 --> 03:49:02.360]  representative paul ryan's first major legislative achievement is a total and complete sell out of
[03:49:02.360 --> 03:49:09.880]  the american people masquerading as an appropriations bill obama's unconstitutional 2012 amnesty for
[03:49:09.880 --> 03:49:15.160]  hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens continues to warm the federal printing presses with work
[03:49:15.160 --> 03:49:21.160]  permits and federal benefits meanwhile the tax paying middle class will be canon fodder for
[03:49:21.160 --> 03:49:27.320]  the unconstitutional obama care penalties that have doubled since last year i intend to keep this
[03:49:27.320 --> 03:49:32.200]  promise if you like your health care plan you'll be able to keep your health care plan breitbart
[03:49:32.200 --> 03:49:39.560]  continues obama's executive action known as deferred action for childhood arrivals has granted
[03:49:39.560 --> 03:49:46.200]  around 700 000 illegal aliens with work permits as well as the ability to receive tax credits
[03:49:46.200 --> 03:49:51.640]  and federal entitlement programs regardless of the fact that a promising 32 year old american
[03:49:51.640 --> 03:49:57.320]  woman was gunned down in broad daylight in san francisco as a result of the failed policies of
[03:49:57.320 --> 03:50:03.960]  the revolving door allowing criminals to return to sanctuary cities ryan is rewarding these sanctuary
[03:50:03.960 --> 03:50:10.840]  cities with a heap of federal grants division b title two of ryan's omnibus funds various grant
[03:50:10.840 --> 03:50:19.720]  programs for the department of justice pages 167 168 169 and contains no language that would restrict

[03:54:07.960 --> 03:54:11.000]  macadoo she's going to be telling us what's coming up on the nightly news tonight which
[03:54:11.000 --> 03:54:16.840]  she'll be hosting we've been talking about this omni bust bill and of course it's not just finances
[03:54:16.840 --> 03:54:22.680]  they've also put in an even worse version of sissa that just recently passed so
[03:54:22.680 --> 03:54:26.440]  they're coming after your freedoms as well democrats can be concerned about that and
[03:54:26.440 --> 03:54:30.360]  democrats need to be concerned that even though there's a lot of programs that were funded in
[03:54:30.360 --> 03:54:36.680]  this bill by republicans that democrats want to have that obama wants to have they need to take
[03:54:36.680 --> 03:54:41.880]  a look at what's going on bernie sanders today and of course this is breaking news you know there's
[03:54:41.880 --> 03:54:46.840]  talk about the gop brokering a convention well we've got brokered debates we've got brokered
[03:54:46.840 --> 03:54:52.520]  databases you want to talk about the syspa legislation that just passed there's a back
[03:54:52.520 --> 03:54:58.360]  and forth in terms of who got whose database but i watched the press conference from bernie sanders
[03:54:58.360 --> 03:55:04.200]  campaign manager and he was absolutely furious he was literally shaking with anger and he made
[03:55:04.200 --> 03:55:07.800]  some of these comments and of course this is the way npr summarizes it they've been locked out of a
[03:55:07.800 --> 03:55:12.920]  key database of democrat voter information after a staffer access data collected and organized by
[03:55:12.920 --> 03:55:19.240]  the clinton campaign and of course this is not that he hacked into it this was a poorly written
[03:55:19.240 --> 03:55:26.440]  software that had been exposed of the sanders campaigns data back in october they said hey
[03:55:26.440 --> 03:55:31.240]  this firewall that is supposed to keep this information private for the separate campaigns
[03:55:31.240 --> 03:55:36.200]  is not working our data is exposed this data was exposed this staffer took a look at it they
[03:55:36.200 --> 03:55:41.720]  subsequently fired this staffer but now they have blockaded this data which they need to identify
[03:55:41.720 --> 03:55:47.000]  and to contact voters and of course the sanders campaign is funded out of a grassroots this is
[03:55:47.000 --> 03:55:52.280]  some things they said this is an inappropriate uh re overreaction now they are actively attempting
[03:55:52.280 --> 03:55:57.000]  to undermine our campaign if the dnc continues to hold our data hostage we will be seeking immediate
[03:55:57.000 --> 03:56:01.400]  relief and federal court clearly while the information was made available to our campaign
[03:56:01.400 --> 03:56:05.800]  because the incompetence of the vendor it should have not been looked at period he said rather
[03:56:05.800 --> 03:56:11.080]  incredibly though the leadership of the dnc has used this incident to shut down our ability to
[03:56:11.080 --> 03:56:15.720]  access our own information information which is the lifeblood of the campaign so we see the same
[03:56:15.720 --> 03:56:20.920]  type of thing happening in the democrat party that is happening in the republican party absolutely
[03:56:20.920 --> 03:56:26.120]  and it's the same thing what's only giving them six debates three of which are on nights when no
[03:56:26.120 --> 03:56:30.440]  one is going to be watching two saturdays one on a sunday one is coming up this saturday
[03:56:30.440 --> 03:56:34.760]  and uh someone from the sanders campaign said what was christmas eve booked because they're
[03:56:34.760 --> 03:56:40.280]  specifically setting these up so that no one will watch and that's because everyone knows the name
[03:56:40.280 --> 03:56:45.240]  clinton so as long as her opponents don't get any airtime they figure they can sway the vote so
[03:56:45.240 --> 03:56:50.840]  the dnc is clearly all in for for hillary and i think bernie sanders needs to run as an independent
[03:56:50.840 --> 03:56:54.760]  yeah exactly now you got somebody coming up tonight that is a feminist who is upset with
[03:56:54.760 --> 03:56:59.160]  the motives that are being pushed out now this is author joy brightened she is a liberal she is a
[03:56:59.160 --> 03:57:04.120]  feminist she's a champion for women's rights um and it's that simple fact that caused her to
[03:57:04.120 --> 03:57:09.720]  write this book uh sharia ism is here at the battle to control women and everyone else and of course
[03:57:09.720 --> 03:57:13.560]  that's one aspect of it the other part of it is women in combat that's what star wars is pushing
[03:57:13.560 --> 03:57:18.040]  they can't get enough men perhaps to buy into their imperialist war so they're gonna have to go with
[03:57:18.040 --> 03:57:22.760]  both sexes to fill up the ranks yeah before we uh run out of time here i want to let everybody
