[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the Information War continues.
[00:07.000 --> 00:14.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:14.000 --> 00:16.000]  Thank you for joining us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16.000 --> 00:23.000]  It is the 17th day of January, 2010, on this Sunday edition.
[00:23.000 --> 00:26.000]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours.
[00:26.000 --> 00:29.000]  I'm here every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. Central.
[00:29.000 --> 00:32.000]  Back Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central.
[00:32.000 --> 00:36.000]  That's 12 noon to 4 p.m. Eastern.
[00:36.000 --> 00:48.000]  We're going to have open phones as well later in the broadcast, later in the second half hour into the second hour of the broadcast.
[00:48.000 --> 00:53.000]  I'll go ahead and give you that toll-free number, but again, we're not opening the phones up for about 30 minutes.
[00:53.000 --> 00:57.000]  888-201-2244, 888-201-2244.
[00:57.000 --> 01:00.000]  Here are the stacks of news I have in front of me.
[01:00.000 --> 01:04.000]  Obviously, you don't need me to tell you about what's happening in Haiti.
[01:04.000 --> 01:05.000]  It's a true tragedy.
[01:05.000 --> 01:19.000]  I myself have given to several charities that already were in Haiti and have also sent a bunch of our old shoes to a program and also some new shoes we bought to the Haitians.
[01:19.000 --> 01:33.000]  I would caution people against giving to United Way and American Red Cross because they've been caught in Oklahoma City and 9-11 and other events, keeping most of the money for themselves and giving it to anti-gun control groups.
[01:33.000 --> 01:36.000]  London Guardian tried to distort what Rush Limbaugh was saying.
[01:36.000 --> 01:42.000]  You know, I'm not a big fan of Rush Limbaugh, fake conservative on most issues, but they distorted what he had to say, saying, oh, Limbaugh says don't give to the Haitians.
[01:42.000 --> 01:45.000]  That's not actually what he said if you read the article and listen to the clip.
[01:45.000 --> 01:50.000]  He said, oh, yeah, American Red Cross may give it to somebody else, which they do do.
[01:50.000 --> 01:53.000]  And so I do think you should give to the Haitians.
[01:53.000 --> 01:59.000]  This is a disaster of biblical proportions, but you need to be careful about who you give to.
[01:59.000 --> 02:05.000]  And throughout the week, as we did last week, I'll give you some examples of what we think are some better charities.
[02:05.000 --> 02:13.000]  But basically charities that have been in Haiti or in Latin America or in the Caribbean, charities have a proven track record of actually helping people.
[02:13.000 --> 02:15.000]  That's who you should give to.
[02:15.000 --> 02:23.000]  But things are so bad there that they're reporting that, well, here's the CNN headline, security concerns cause doctors to leave hospitals and quake victims.
[02:23.000 --> 02:25.000]  That's out today.
[02:25.000 --> 02:27.000]  I mean, it's so bad.
[02:27.000 --> 02:34.000]  It's so road warrior there, complete collapse.
[02:34.000 --> 02:39.000]  I mean, watching footage of a helicopter trying to come in to drop off aid and thousands rushing in trying to get it.
[02:39.000 --> 02:47.000]  And children, men and women lined up begging for meager amounts of food given to them by the UN and Argentinian UN peacekeepers.
[02:47.000 --> 02:53.000]  And then the majority of them going hungry and children fighting over cardboard boxes.
[02:53.000 --> 02:55.000]  It is truly nightmarish.
[02:55.000 --> 03:01.000]  So we need to be praying for the folks there in Haiti, obviously as well.
[03:01.000 --> 03:03.000]  But there's plenty of aid available.
[03:03.000 --> 03:07.000]  It's getting the aid into the country.
[03:07.000 --> 03:11.000]  And there's a lot of, of course, complaints that the military and the UN aren't getting into them quick enough.
[03:11.000 --> 03:14.000]  Folks, government can't and won't protect you.
[03:14.000 --> 03:16.000]  It's never able to.
[03:16.000 --> 03:19.000]  That's why we always talk about being prepared, being self-sufficient.
[03:19.000 --> 03:26.000]  That's your job so that when disaster strikes, you're able to take care of yourself, your neighbors, your friends and your family.
[03:26.000 --> 03:36.000]  Obviously, Haiti, the poorest country in this hemisphere, poorest country in the Americas from Alaska down to Chile.
[03:36.000 --> 03:42.000]  There is nowhere in North America, Central America or South America or the Caribbean as poor as Haiti.
[03:42.000 --> 03:51.000]  So it couldn't have happened to a more, a more, well, well, it couldn't have happened to a worse nation.
[03:51.000 --> 03:57.000]  I mean, it just absolutely the perfect storm of humanitarian disaster.
[03:57.000 --> 04:03.000]  So you're welcome to call in about Haiti if you want, obviously, a thousand times worse than Katrina.
[04:03.000 --> 04:10.000]  I mean, this is just a human tragedy of uncalculable proportions.
[04:10.000 --> 04:14.000]  You're welcome to call in about it, but I've got a bunch of other news I'm going to be covering after the break.
[04:14.000 --> 04:22.000]  Obviously, you've all heard Pat Robertson say that they made a deal with the devil so they're being cursed.
[04:22.000 --> 04:29.000]  Asinine, those children don't deserve what has happened to them regardless if you believe the fables.
[04:29.000 --> 04:33.000]  But even worse is Danny Gloverson global warming did this.
[04:33.000 --> 04:35.000]  I mean, what a fraud.
[04:35.000 --> 04:48.000]  Even if you believe man made global warming, it has nothing to do, the atmosphere has nothing to do with tectonic plates and volcanoes and what's happening in the mantle and the crust and the core of the earth.
[04:48.000 --> 04:55.000]  All right, coming up, the establishment of the Council of Governors, a Bush error idea being carried out by Obama.
[04:55.000 --> 04:59.000]  You talk about Big Brother Marshall Law Police State, this is it.
[05:26.000 --> 05:33.000]  The Silver Nano Particles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products.
[05:33.000 --> 05:38.000]  You can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[05:38.000 --> 05:44.000]  Very easy to follow step by step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[05:44.000 --> 05:51.000]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[05:51.000 --> 05:55.000]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[06:22.000 --> 06:25.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[06:25.000 --> 06:33.000]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Sunday, the 17th day of January 2010.
[06:33.000 --> 06:36.000]  Here is the news in my stacks we'll be covering today.
[06:36.000 --> 06:46.000]  Obviously, what's going on in Haiti, this human tragedy of uncalculable horrendous magnitude.
[06:46.000 --> 06:54.000]  We will also be getting into Cass Sunstein, one of the top czars in the Obama Administration.
[06:54.000 --> 06:59.000]  This is the guy who heads up the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.
[06:59.000 --> 07:03.000]  He interprets federal implementation of laws and regulations.
[07:03.000 --> 07:06.000]  He has been saying that he wants to ban free speech.
[07:06.000 --> 07:08.000]  Yeah, we're going to read his quotes.
[07:08.000 --> 07:10.000]  He's been saying ban the Second Amendment outright.
[07:10.000 --> 07:13.000]  He said infiltrate, quote, conspiracy groups.
[07:13.000 --> 07:22.000]  Anyone that questions the government, anyone that questions official dogma in any way needs to be basically arrested.
[07:22.000 --> 07:29.000]  Either the 90-year-old Justice John Paul Stevens or Ruth Bader Ginsburg are scheduled the next year or two,
[07:29.000 --> 07:32.000]  both of them making noises about leaving the court.
[07:32.000 --> 07:38.000]  And he tried to bring Sunstein up to take the place that Sotomayor got.
[07:38.000 --> 07:48.000]  But instead, she got it, and so this guy could be the Supreme Court justice, the next associate justice.
[07:48.000 --> 07:54.000]  I mean, it's really hard to believe he actually has written all these white papers and given these speeches.
[07:54.000 --> 07:58.000]  Thursday and Friday we played clips of him, video clips, audio clips.
[07:58.000 --> 08:00.000]  We read from white papers.
[08:00.000 --> 08:04.000]  He has written like this one.
[08:04.000 --> 08:13.000]  This is University of Chicago law school, law, economic research, paper series, paper number 387.
[08:13.000 --> 08:17.000]  And this was put out a year and a half ago, Cass R. Sunstein.
[08:17.000 --> 08:27.000]  And you read this, it's like some type of absurdist 1984 satire, but it's really, really happening.
[08:27.000 --> 08:32.000]  So we're going to look at the type of tyrants in the Obama administration, and it's mainly the left.
[08:32.000 --> 08:38.000]  I learned about this, not from the controlled right of Fox News.
[08:38.000 --> 08:44.000]  I learned about it from The Village Voice, from Ross Story, and others calling him a fascist.
[08:44.000 --> 08:46.000]  And I mean, that's really what he is.
[08:46.000 --> 08:52.000]  I mean, openly says we're going to ban free speech, and we're going to decide what you can and can't say,
[08:52.000 --> 08:58.000]  and the conspiracy theories, which again, he lists things like global warming not being manmade.
[08:58.000 --> 09:00.000]  That's a restable offense.
[09:00.000 --> 09:05.000]  He lists things like believing the government was involved in killing Kennedy.
[09:05.000 --> 09:08.000]  Over 90% in a CBS poll we have a link to.
[09:08.000 --> 09:10.000]  I guess they need to be arrested.
[09:10.000 --> 09:13.000]  He says criticizing the banks.
[09:13.000 --> 09:19.000]  I mean, questioning the official story of 9-11, which six of the 10 9-11 commission members and farmer,
[09:19.000 --> 09:21.000]  one of their head lawyers says there's a cover up going on.
[09:21.000 --> 09:25.000]  I guess that's, I mean, as an American, you don't have a right to free speech.
[09:25.000 --> 09:31.000]  I mean, this guy is a piece of work, so that's coming up later in the broadcast because then I found out
[09:31.000 --> 09:34.000]  he wants to take organs without consent.
[09:34.000 --> 09:36.000]  I mean, what next?
[09:36.000 --> 09:42.000]  I mean, is this guy, what's he have buried in his basement?
[09:42.000 --> 09:46.000]  I mean, it's like satire.
[09:46.000 --> 09:48.000]  It's like satire.
[09:48.000 --> 09:51.000]  It's hard to believe this is real.
[09:51.000 --> 09:55.000]  And then they just go over the straight face and then tell those of us that don't want this tyranny,
[09:55.000 --> 09:57.000]  or police state that we're the weird ones.
[09:57.000 --> 09:58.000]  We're the bad ones.
[09:58.000 --> 10:03.000]  I have MSNBC here doing a special documentary with Chris Matthews.
[10:03.000 --> 10:08.000]  And I held up Ecoscience written by John P. Holdren to him,
[10:08.000 --> 10:13.000]  where he talks about putting chemicals in the water to sterilize this and setting up a planetary dictatorship
[10:13.000 --> 10:14.000]  and one child policies.
[10:14.000 --> 10:17.000]  And they said, Alex, this is so radical, what you're saying.
[10:17.000 --> 10:19.000]  I'm not the one that said it.
[10:19.000 --> 10:22.000]  When Ted Turner says he wants to get rid of 90% of the useless eaters.
[10:22.000 --> 10:23.000]  That's a quote.
[10:23.000 --> 10:24.000]  I'm not the radical.
[10:24.000 --> 10:25.000]  He is.
[10:25.000 --> 10:29.000]  When Cass Sunstein says arrest people for their free speech.
[10:29.000 --> 10:30.000]  I'm not the radical.
[10:30.000 --> 10:32.000]  I'm reading what he said.
[10:32.000 --> 10:37.000]  You know, when Danny Glover comes out and says the people of Haiti have this earthquake because of global warming,
[10:37.000 --> 10:45.000]  when no volcanologist, no climatologist, no one that studies geology or the earth would ever say
[10:45.000 --> 10:52.000]  that the atmosphere has anything to do with tectonic earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis.
[10:52.000 --> 10:54.000]  But that doesn't matter.
[10:54.000 --> 11:00.000]  I'm the radical for disagreeing with Danny Glover that man made global warming that's made up itself
[11:00.000 --> 11:03.000]  supposedly caused the earthquake.
[11:03.000 --> 11:08.000]  It's just as stupid as saying that the Haitians are cursed when Pat Robertson said it.
[11:08.000 --> 11:12.000]  Again, I see myself as the sane person.
[11:12.000 --> 11:15.000]  But again, I guess I'm weird.
[11:15.000 --> 11:17.000]  I don't agree with Pat Robertson or Danny Glover.
[11:17.000 --> 11:26.000]  And I don't agree with Ted Turner when he says he wants to set up a planetary government to get rid of at least 90% of the population
[11:26.000 --> 11:36.000]  or Dr. Eric Pionka, University of Texas biology professor saying he wants 90% of the population to die from airborne Ebola.
[11:36.000 --> 11:39.000]  And then I had the national media call me when that happened and said, oh, why are you radical?
[11:39.000 --> 11:41.000]  Why are you against this?
[11:41.000 --> 11:42.000]  I guess so.
[11:42.000 --> 11:46.000]  I guess I am the radical because I'm against 90% of people being killed.
[11:46.000 --> 11:55.000]  Again, that's why the mainstream media is losing all credibility because they continue day after day, week after week, year after year,
[11:55.000 --> 12:04.000]  coming out with their extreme agendas and then telling us those of us that are just normal people that want to be free and be left alone,
[12:04.000 --> 12:10.000]  that we've got the problem trying to use peer pressure to control us to make us capitulate to their entire program.
[12:10.000 --> 12:11.000]  Well, it's over.
[12:11.000 --> 12:12.000]  It's not happening anymore.
[12:12.000 --> 12:21.000]  So again, Cass Sunstein, the top White House regulatory czar, this lawyer saying that he wants to get rid of free speech,
[12:21.000 --> 12:25.000]  restrict the internet, shut down free speech on the web and much more.
[12:25.000 --> 12:27.000]  What's happening in Haiti?
[12:27.000 --> 12:29.000]  We're also going to get into Banksturgate.
[12:29.000 --> 12:33.000]  A lot of these politicians are in deep, deep trouble right now.
[12:33.000 --> 12:36.000]  A lot of these bankers and economists are in trouble.
[12:36.000 --> 12:43.000]  There's open talk of inditing and investigations to indict the current Treasury Secretary,
[12:43.000 --> 12:50.000]  Timmy Geithner, who was the New York Fed chief, who set the policy for AIG to make it secret who was getting the bailout money,
[12:50.000 --> 12:56.000]  namely his former boss at Goldman Sachs, then Treasury Secretary in 2008, Henry Paulson.
[12:56.000 --> 13:02.000]  And now Business Week reports Paulson asked to testify at AIG bailout hearing with Geithner.
[13:02.000 --> 13:04.000]  So that's certainly exciting.
[13:04.000 --> 13:08.000]  We have a powerful article up on infowars.com by Kurt Nemo here.
[13:08.000 --> 13:13.000]  SEC engages in conspiracy with AIG to hide bailout evidence.
[13:13.000 --> 13:18.000]  And that's what Judge Napolitano called it earlier this week here on this show.
[13:18.000 --> 13:29.000]  Also, Obama's 10-year, $90 billion bank tax is a tiny fraction of what the banks have already stolen from the American people.
[13:29.000 --> 13:34.000]  And so it is putting a Band-Aid on an ax wound.
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  So we'll be going over that.
[13:36.000 --> 13:41.000]  It's like last year Obama signed an executive order saying, I'm going to block bonus money to the big banks.
[13:41.000 --> 13:47.000]  And people actually read the document and what did it say?
[13:47.000 --> 13:48.000]  They actually read the executive order.
[13:48.000 --> 13:53.000]  It said, oh, all these big banks, well, they are exempt.
[13:53.000 --> 13:56.000]  They are exempt from this.
[13:56.000 --> 14:00.000]  So the real people doing the looting, engaging the criminal looting, they're going to be left alone.
[14:00.000 --> 14:05.000]  There's been big new developments on the naked body scanners going in all the major airports.
[14:05.000 --> 14:11.000]  Now we learn they're already going in courthouses before the deadly underwear bomber popped up right on time.
[14:11.000 --> 14:13.000]  And more and more congressmen are fighting it.
[14:13.000 --> 14:23.000]  We also have a joke PSA we're going to air done by the CBC in Canada where they show the naked body scanners and really what they're actually doing.
[14:23.000 --> 14:24.000]  So that's coming up.
[14:24.000 --> 14:28.000]  Also have a stack of news here dealing with the hoaxes that have been imploding.
[14:28.000 --> 14:33.000]  Wall Street Journal, European snub vaccine and states cancel orders.
[14:33.000 --> 14:37.000]  And of course, as we've been telling you for the last few months, it's now mainstream news.
[14:37.000 --> 14:47.000]  The head of the EU's health board says it was all a premeditated fraud to build taxpayers and to sell a quote dangerous vaccine.
[14:47.000 --> 14:54.000]  So that is coming up as well. And the left is really waking up to Obama.
[14:54.000 --> 14:56.000]  Again, those still caught the fake left-right paradigm.
[14:56.000 --> 14:59.000]  Village voice headline, George W. Obama.
[14:59.000 --> 15:03.000]  And it goes into talk about how horrible Obama is.
[15:03.000 --> 15:13.000]  And I want to commend the so-called left for being quicker to wake up to Obama's fraud than the Republicans were to George Bush, the Patriot Act, launching all these wars, free speech zones,
[15:13.000 --> 15:17.000]  tripling the size of government.
[15:17.000 --> 15:29.000]  But I want to tell you now, Dick Army, the mainline Republicans, Glenn Beck, they are going to betray you in the next year once they get control of the House and the Senate.
[15:29.000 --> 15:31.000]  But that's the dilemma. You don't have a choice.
[15:31.000 --> 15:33.000]  You've got to put them in there to block Obama.
[15:33.000 --> 15:40.000]  But as soon as Republicans then get a majority when a Republican president gets in in three years, then we'll have to try to get Democrats in to block them.
[15:40.000 --> 15:49.000]  So I guess the founding fathers were right. Gridlock, Balkanization, the separation of powers in the government is the only thing keeping any semblance of liberty here.
[15:49.000 --> 15:56.000]  Because the Democrats and Republicans all work for the power elite, that is the leadership does, and literally want to set up this police state.
[15:56.000 --> 15:59.000]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[15:59.000 --> 16:08.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history.
[16:08.000 --> 16:13.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[16:13.000 --> 16:19.000]  They've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[16:19.000 --> 16:24.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[16:24.000 --> 16:34.000]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal off-short cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[16:34.000 --> 16:41.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[16:41.000 --> 16:48.000]  Today it seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[16:48.000 --> 16:59.000]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.

[17:05.000 --> 17:08.000]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[17:08.000 --> 17:13.000]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[17:13.000 --> 17:18.000]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from infowars.com.

[18:26.000 --> 18:31.000]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[18:31.000 --> 18:35.000]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.

[20:01.000 --> 20:08.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[20:08.000 --> 20:22.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. Again, thank you for joining us, spending some of your Sunday afternoon or evening with us,
[20:22.000 --> 20:26.000]  spending a lot of time zone you're tuning into across the globe.
[20:26.000 --> 20:31.000]  It might be the middle of the night or 5 a.m. in the morning. Again, thank you for joining us.
[20:31.000 --> 20:46.000]  Okay, here's our top story. I covered this some last week. Obama signed this, well, just seven days ago on January 11, 2010.
[20:46.000 --> 20:52.000]  And I spent a few days reading over it, checking the U.S. Code, checking the laws that it mentions,
[20:52.000 --> 21:01.000]  and it ties into Presidential Decision Directive 51 signed by Bush three years ago.
[21:01.000 --> 21:07.000]  And remember, Congress wanted to get the full Presidential Decision Directive in accompanying executive order,
[21:07.000 --> 21:12.000]  and Bush declared national security and wouldn't even let Homeland Security Committee,
[21:12.000 --> 21:17.000]  which is supposedly co-equal with the President, wouldn't even let them have access to it.
[21:17.000 --> 21:25.000]  Okay, but the cover sheet stated that for any emergency, including economic, anywhere in the world,
[21:25.000 --> 21:32.000]  that the executive is over the legislative and judicial, over the courts, over the Congress,
[21:32.000 --> 21:35.000]  which is unconstitutional, supposed to have separation of powers.
[21:35.000 --> 21:38.000]  The people aren't supposed to be divided, what the government always tries to do.
[21:38.000 --> 21:42.000]  The government's supposed to be divided so that you can't ever get a dictatorship.
[21:42.000 --> 21:48.000]  Well, this is what the Founders said. This is what America is. It's why we love the Declaration of Independence
[21:48.000 --> 21:50.000]  and the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[21:50.000 --> 21:56.000]  So President Bush signed this national security directive,
[21:56.000 --> 22:02.000]  and I want, for the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, we're going to give folks a document cam shot of this.
[22:02.000 --> 22:07.000]  And it says, the Continued Government Program will enhance the credibility of our national security posture
[22:07.000 --> 22:11.000]  and enable more rapid, effective response and recovery, and it goes on.
[22:11.000 --> 22:16.000]  The catastrophic emergency means any incident, regardless of location in the world,
[22:16.000 --> 22:21.000]  that results in extraordinary levels of mass casualties, damages, or disruption,
[22:21.000 --> 22:26.000]  severely affecting the U.S. population, infrastructure, environment, economy, or government functions.
[22:26.000 --> 22:31.000]  And under this, the President is over the governors, he's over the legislatures of the states,
[22:31.000 --> 22:34.000]  he's over the Congress, and Congress has no authority.
[22:34.000 --> 22:39.000]  And then Congress asks for the full secret document, and it's still classified to this day.
[22:39.000 --> 22:44.000]  Obama has continued breaking his promise of transparency and has not released the full text of this
[22:44.000 --> 22:46.000]  and other memorandum.
[22:46.000 --> 22:52.000]  Though connected into this is his new announcement, his new announcement.
[22:52.000 --> 23:01.000]  He is creating, with this executive order, executive order signed January 11th, 2010,
[23:01.000 --> 23:08.000]  with this new executive order titled Establishment of the Council of Governors,
[23:08.000 --> 23:13.000]  and this is an actual copy from the White House.gov.
[23:13.000 --> 23:15.000]  I'll have my guys live on air at Google.
[23:15.000 --> 23:18.000]  Establishment of the Council of Governors executive order.
[23:18.000 --> 23:24.000]  We'll pull it up at WhiteHouse.gov for you, and it's a short order.
[23:24.000 --> 23:32.000]  And it says here in the document that they are taking the governors, the states, the police forces,
[23:32.000 --> 23:38.000]  everything under the control of Northcom, that's the Pentagon, and Homeland Security,
[23:38.000 --> 23:43.000]  but don't worry, the states have their say, the president is going to appoint the 10 members,
[23:43.000 --> 23:48.000]  five governors from the Republican and five governors from the Democrats.
[23:48.000 --> 23:52.000]  Kind of like Bush called the 9-11 Commission independent when he appointed it,
[23:52.000 --> 23:56.000]  or Janet Reno appointed her own Waco investigation team.
[23:56.000 --> 24:01.000]  This would be like Hitler appointing his own Nuremberg judges.
[24:01.000 --> 24:06.000]  I mean, it's, or Al Capone at his own court case doing that.
[24:06.000 --> 24:09.000]  I mean, it's just absolutely ridiculous.
[24:09.000 --> 24:18.000]  And there it is at WhiteHouse.gov, the executive order for anyone that wishes to see that for themselves.
[24:18.000 --> 24:28.000]  Separately, I have the Rand Corporation's plan here that they put out last year,
[24:28.000 --> 24:33.000]  and this plan, the stability police force for the United States,
[24:33.000 --> 24:36.000]  justification options for creating U.S. capabilities.
[24:36.000 --> 24:39.000]  This has already been implemented covertly in the last 15 years,
[24:39.000 --> 24:43.000]  but now they're just being open about it, and it has all the maps here
[24:43.000 --> 24:48.000]  of how stability police force headquarters to run your local city.
[24:48.000 --> 24:55.000]  They have systems for medium-sized police forces, large police forces.
[24:55.000 --> 24:59.000]  They have the stability unit for small police units.
[24:59.000 --> 25:01.000]  Again, communist Russia had this.
[25:01.000 --> 25:03.000]  Communist China has this.
[25:03.000 --> 25:07.000]  Russian News is freaking out saying America gets its own Politburo.
[25:07.000 --> 25:12.000]  And on the Richter scale of tyranny, this is about a 10,
[25:12.000 --> 25:16.000]  and it goes back because now all these conservative groups are going,
[25:16.000 --> 25:18.000]  oh my gosh, it's martial law.
[25:18.000 --> 25:22.000]  Oh my gosh, Obama's having a big power grab, and yes he is.
[25:22.000 --> 25:26.000]  But Obama is just a teleprompter reading minion or frontman,
[25:26.000 --> 25:27.000]  just like Bush was.
[25:27.000 --> 25:29.000]  He's just better than Bush was at it.
[25:29.000 --> 25:31.000]  It is the system that's doing this.
[25:31.000 --> 25:37.000]  Big central banks threatened martial law in early October of 2008.
[25:37.000 --> 25:41.000]  We've had multiple congressmen on this show on record
[25:41.000 --> 25:44.000]  that they were threatened that martial law would be declared
[25:44.000 --> 25:47.000]  if the trillions, not 700 billion, but trillions of dollars,
[25:47.000 --> 25:51.000]  Bloomberg reports is now 28 trillion total, 28 trillion,
[25:51.000 --> 25:54.000]  were not given to a handful of banks.
[25:54.000 --> 25:57.000]  J.P. Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and just a few others
[25:57.000 --> 25:59.000]  who are now caught in all this secret of dealings,
[25:59.000 --> 26:02.000]  not letting the public know that they got most of the money,
[26:02.000 --> 26:05.000]  itself a reported crime that they did this.
[26:05.000 --> 26:08.000]  But now Geithner, who was the head of the Fed that set the policy
[26:08.000 --> 26:11.000]  out of the New York branch, that's the main branch with the real power,
[26:11.000 --> 26:13.000]  he's saying he knows nothing about it,
[26:13.000 --> 26:16.000]  but he's being called up before Congress.
[26:16.000 --> 26:20.000]  So we've covered all this in great detail in past shows,
[26:20.000 --> 26:23.000]  but coming out, I've got my fourth police state film,
[26:23.000 --> 26:25.000]  haven't released one since 2002,
[26:25.000 --> 26:31.000]  police state for the rise of FEMA comes out March 1st.
[26:31.000 --> 26:35.000]  The little secret that we've been producing out here, it's very powerful.
[26:35.000 --> 26:40.000]  And we go through all of this gradual de-evolution into classical tyranny.
[26:40.000 --> 26:46.000]  But the issue here, the overriding issue is we are under martial law right now.
[26:46.000 --> 26:50.000]  Martial law was threatened, PDD 51 puts it in place,
[26:50.000 --> 26:54.000]  the John Warner Defense Authorization Act that was passed bipartisanly
[26:54.000 --> 27:00.000]  by Democrat Congress and Republican president in 2007,
[27:00.000 --> 27:04.000]  and they reauthorized it 2008, now 2009, they're doing 2010 now,
[27:04.000 --> 27:07.000]  and this is part of that Defense Authorization Act,
[27:07.000 --> 27:12.000]  this executive order dovetails and gets into the Defense Authorization Act of 2008.
[27:12.000 --> 27:17.000]  In fact, zoom in on that for people. This is bipartisan, all the distractions,
[27:17.000 --> 27:26.000]  all the Tea Party balloons and confetti is a distraction.
[27:26.000 --> 27:31.000]  This is bipartisan tyranny at the highest levels.
[27:31.000 --> 27:35.000]  And the John Warner Defense Authorization Act states that homeland security
[27:35.000 --> 27:40.000]  and Northcom are established to deal with insurrection in the states
[27:40.000 --> 27:42.000]  and insurrection by governors.
[27:42.000 --> 27:46.000]  You now see 33 governors are saying they may declare 10th Amendment powers
[27:46.000 --> 27:49.000]  and not go under all this unconstitutional federal control.
[27:49.000 --> 27:54.000]  So the globalist tacticians and theoreticians and social engineers
[27:54.000 --> 27:58.000]  knew the real legitimate threat would come under the 9th and 10th Amendment under law
[27:58.000 --> 28:02.000]  to all this unconstitutional garbage that's taking place.
[28:02.000 --> 28:05.000]  The Democrats howled and screamed about Bush setting this up and said,
[28:05.000 --> 28:07.000]  oh, he wants to be a dictator.
[28:07.000 --> 28:10.000]  Then Obama comes in, Republicans say, oh, he wants to be a dictator.
[28:10.000 --> 28:14.000]  No, it's the military industrial complex controlled by the banks
[28:14.000 --> 28:18.000]  that Eisenhower warned us about that already has this power in place.
[28:18.000 --> 28:21.000]  And now we've released the press releases, we've posted them.
[28:21.000 --> 28:26.000]  Last year, the CHIP highway police said, oh, yes, we work with the Marines
[28:26.000 --> 28:30.000]  all over the states running random checkpoints for DWI on citizens.
[28:30.000 --> 28:32.000]  You're not for drunk drivers, R-U-P-R.
[28:32.000 --> 28:38.000]  Oh, troops of the Kentucky Derby, the NFL, warrantless checkpoints with the Army and Marines in Tennessee.
[28:38.000 --> 28:43.000]  They're quietly getting everyone ready for this and testing what local governments will resist.
[28:43.000 --> 28:49.000]  But on record, the federal government is engaging in high treason, overthrowing states' rights.
[28:49.000 --> 28:51.000]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[28:51.000 --> 28:59.000]  This is so huge, he's now creating a governor's council of puppets so he can say he controls the states.
[28:59.000 --> 29:04.000]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator
[29:04.000 --> 29:07.000]  that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.

[30:21.000 --> 30:24.000]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[30:24.000 --> 30:28.000]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[30:28.000 --> 30:31.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[30:31.000 --> 30:35.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[30:35.000 --> 30:40.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[30:40.000 --> 30:45.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[31:22.000 --> 31:25.000]  Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[31:25.000 --> 31:30.000]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[31:30.000 --> 31:34.000]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[31:34.000 --> 31:40.000]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.

[33:13.000 --> 33:18.000]  MSNBC is here making a documentary about tea parties. I should have thrown that out for listeners.
[33:18.000 --> 33:25.000]  They want to hear what people are joining tea parties or why people are obsessed with the tea parties.
[33:25.000 --> 33:29.000]  Well, the media has done that. They've tried to make it a right-wing issue.
[33:29.000 --> 33:33.000]  The tea parties themselves aren't just a Republican or right-wing thing.
[33:33.000 --> 33:37.000]  Though they're being taken over by that, it was originally founded by Ron Paul supporters,
[33:37.000 --> 33:42.000]  real libertarians, constitutionalists that are against the war, against the police state.
[33:42.000 --> 33:47.000]  Everything Obama is continuing. Here's the toll-free number to join us on this live Sunday edition.
[33:47.000 --> 33:52.000]  888-201-2244, 888-201-2244.
[33:52.000 --> 33:55.000]  And I'm now going to rapid fire, go to your calls.
[33:55.000 --> 33:59.000]  I already got into the new executive order establishing this puppet council of 10 governors
[33:59.000 --> 34:04.000]  that supposedly represent the states, so Obama can then say he speaks for the states
[34:04.000 --> 34:10.000]  and openly says they're merging Homeland Security with police and military at the local level.
[34:10.000 --> 34:16.000]  I mean, talk about unconstitutional, but again, it's continuing from Bush, flawless integration,
[34:16.000 --> 34:20.000]  just different rhetoric to make people think there's been a change.
[34:20.000 --> 34:25.000]  So Obama has the lowest approval rating of any president in the last 100 years
[34:25.000 --> 34:28.000]  in his first year in office, and it's plunging even faster.
[34:28.000 --> 34:33.000]  Will he stage a terror attack or a crisis like other presidents have done?
[34:33.000 --> 34:38.000]  Will he launch a new war? Will they expand the financial implosion to get more power?
[34:38.000 --> 34:41.000]  This is what politicians and tyrants do.
[34:41.000 --> 34:46.000]  888-201-2244, let's talk to Dustin in Oregon.
[34:46.000 --> 34:49.000]  You're on the year worldwide, Dustin.
[34:49.000 --> 34:52.000]  Yes, Alex. Thanks for having me on.
[34:52.000 --> 34:58.000]  I'm calling to let you and the world know that there's a beta test going on here in Oregon.
[34:58.000 --> 35:05.000]  It measures 66 and 67, also known as House Bill 2649 and 3405.
[35:05.000 --> 35:09.000]  Is that the tax you buy the mile in your car?
[35:09.000 --> 35:16.000]  It's the tax to make up for estimated loss in budget for state and federal programs.
[35:16.000 --> 35:21.000]  We're being threatened for our utility and public services.
[35:21.000 --> 35:25.000]  Yes, there are carbon taxes driving by the mile.
[35:25.000 --> 35:29.000]  Everyone is to be taxed to pay off the giant debt created by the banks,
[35:29.000 --> 35:31.000]  and the people have got to say no.
[35:31.000 --> 35:33.000]  Yeah, absolutely.
[35:33.000 --> 35:42.000]  They've put out a bunch of rhetoric already saying that we're going to lose health education,
[35:42.000 --> 35:46.000]  public safety, all these programs basically would be threatened.
[35:46.000 --> 35:47.000]  That's what they do.
[35:47.000 --> 35:51.000]  Just like Nigeria or something where 90% of its budget is debt,
[35:51.000 --> 35:55.000]  the government just expands and expands and expands,
[35:55.000 --> 35:58.000]  and then says we've got to have more taxes or we won't give you essential services.
[35:58.000 --> 36:00.000]  The old trick is over 50 years old,
[36:00.000 --> 36:07.000]  where cities would waste all the money but then not fill potholes or get radios in police cars
[36:07.000 --> 36:11.000]  and then say, oh, the police are going to not go to work unless you give us more money.
[36:11.000 --> 36:14.000]  It's part of the government holding its hostage.
[36:14.000 --> 36:15.000]  Absolutely.
[36:15.000 --> 36:23.000]  They're also saying that the public job rate would raise,
[36:23.000 --> 36:27.000]  which they say it's going to add 25,000 new public employees.
[36:27.000 --> 36:30.000]  Yeah, almost all the new jobs are government.
[36:30.000 --> 36:31.000]  I appreciate your call.
[36:31.000 --> 36:33.000]  Great points, Dustin.
[36:33.000 --> 36:34.000]  Excellent points.
[36:34.000 --> 36:36.000]  It is unbelievable.
[36:36.000 --> 36:40.000]  Government is exploding in size, raising every tax you can imagine.
[36:40.000 --> 36:43.000]  And they're not going to stop until we stop them.
[36:43.000 --> 36:44.000]  And how do we do that?
[36:44.000 --> 36:47.000]  Because they ignore what the people want.
[36:47.000 --> 36:51.000]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Scott in Minnesota.
[36:51.000 --> 36:53.000]  Scott, you're on the year.
[36:53.000 --> 36:55.000]  Hi.
[36:55.000 --> 36:57.000]  You get me.
[36:57.000 --> 37:00.000]  I was listening to the Matrix of Evil,
[37:00.000 --> 37:05.000]  and you were saying something about how the counties and spots need to separate on their own.
[37:05.000 --> 37:10.000]  I would just like to nominate Mr. Ventura for something here in Wright County, Minnesota.
[37:10.000 --> 37:15.000]  I know cops and Marines and criminals.
[37:15.000 --> 37:18.000]  And we were next to a part of Northfield.
[37:18.000 --> 37:20.000]  Jesse was trying to rob a bank here.
[37:20.000 --> 37:22.000]  And Jesse was the first person I voted for.
[37:22.000 --> 37:23.000]  Scott, I got to let you go.
[37:23.000 --> 37:25.000]  Your phone's just too bad.
[37:25.000 --> 37:26.000]  I can't really understand you.
[37:26.000 --> 37:28.000]  I think you're talking about my film Matrix of Evil,
[37:28.000 --> 37:34.000]  where I came up with a plan in 2002 to have cities, counties, and states
[37:34.000 --> 37:37.000]  declare that they will follow the Bill of Rights and Constitution
[37:37.000 --> 37:41.000]  and their state constitutions and make a pledge against the Patriot Act.
[37:41.000 --> 37:43.000]  800-plus cities and towns did it.
[37:43.000 --> 37:45.000]  More than four states did it.
[37:45.000 --> 37:47.000]  And that's what I was talking about there.
[37:47.000 --> 37:50.000]  But yes, take over your local communities lawfully and legally
[37:50.000 --> 37:56.000]  so the feds can't come in and raise taxes to steal your money to give it to offshore banks.
[37:56.000 --> 37:59.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joe in Dallas.
[37:59.000 --> 38:01.000]  Joe in Dallas, you're on the air.
[38:01.000 --> 38:03.000]  Welcome.
[38:03.000 --> 38:05.000]  Good.
[38:05.000 --> 38:09.000]  I was calling about, I actually got one of my articles posted on your site
[38:09.000 --> 38:14.000]  in the footsteps of our forefathers, an article about George Washington.
[38:14.000 --> 38:16.000]  And I was reading through the comments on that thing.
[38:16.000 --> 38:19.000]  And a bunch of people are making a point, oh, Washington's amazing.
[38:19.000 --> 38:20.000]  This, that, and the other.
[38:20.000 --> 38:21.000]  But that's not really the point.
[38:21.000 --> 38:27.000]  The point of that article was is that basically collectivism like that has been funneled.
[38:27.000 --> 38:32.000]  It originates with the Illuminati, but the ideas come from antiquity.
[38:32.000 --> 38:38.000]  Basically the point is, is that the Illuminati used masonry as a means of spreading their message initially
[38:38.000 --> 38:39.000]  and not all masons are evil.
[38:39.000 --> 38:41.000]  But I think, you know, people seem to miss that point.
[38:41.000 --> 38:43.000]  No, I agree with you.
[38:43.000 --> 38:48.000]  And look, the reason I got into George Washington a few weeks ago is that I was talking about
[38:48.000 --> 38:52.000]  what a great virtuous leader he was and how he turned down being king
[38:52.000 --> 38:55.000]  and he didn't want to be president and he really was a good guy.
[38:55.000 --> 38:59.000]  And you have to look at the Bill of Rights and Constitution and ask yourself,
[38:59.000 --> 39:05.000]  do you want to live under this or this global corporate UN Copenhagen global tax system
[39:05.000 --> 39:07.000]  where private banks rule over us?
[39:07.000 --> 39:08.000]  You know, that's the choice.
[39:08.000 --> 39:13.000]  And then people take out of context his letters that are at the Library of Congress,
[39:13.000 --> 39:19.000]  not understanding classical English and it's prose where he's writing letters fighting the Illuminati,
[39:19.000 --> 39:25.000]  scores of them saying no one is more satisfied than I of the fact that the Illuminati
[39:25.000 --> 39:28.000]  is operating within the United States.
[39:28.000 --> 39:33.000]  They take that out of context and say, look, he's satisfied with the Illuminati,
[39:33.000 --> 39:34.000]  meaning he likes it.
[39:34.000 --> 39:38.000]  No, the next paragraph in the group letters, they didn't have email then,
[39:38.000 --> 39:41.000]  he was writing scores of them to prominent governors and others
[39:41.000 --> 39:45.000]  and members of the legislatures and of the Congress.
[39:45.000 --> 39:49.000]  The next line, and I'm going to do a whole show on these and show the letters,
[39:49.000 --> 39:50.000]  you look at the Library of Congress,
[39:50.000 --> 39:54.000]  just go to Library of Congress, type in George Washington letters, Illuminati
[39:54.000 --> 39:56.000]  and just scores of them come up, the actual scans.
[39:56.000 --> 40:01.000]  The next paragraph says there is no more wicked or evil or disgusting group
[40:01.000 --> 40:04.000]  than the Illuminati and their Jacobin allies in France.
[40:04.000 --> 40:12.000]  They had tried to overthrow the U.S. after the U.S. got sovereignty from Great Britain.
[40:12.000 --> 40:17.000]  They tried to come in and get George Washington to declare war on Canada
[40:17.000 --> 40:23.000]  and basically take over French Canada and they tried to have insurrection in the U.S. to do that
[40:23.000 --> 40:28.000]  and he was fighting them, so it's a lie to say George Washington was a member of the Illuminati.
[40:28.000 --> 40:31.000]  The general public doesn't even know that exists as part of history,
[40:31.000 --> 40:35.000]  but here are his letters, when he was fighting the Illuminati.
[40:35.000 --> 40:44.000]  And then they say, well, there's statues of him in D.C. in these Masonic poses and all this stuff.
[40:44.000 --> 40:48.000]  Those were made hundreds of years in many cases after him.
[40:48.000 --> 40:49.000]  Was he a Mason?
[40:49.000 --> 40:53.000]  Yes. Are all Masons part of the New World Order? No.
[40:53.000 --> 40:57.000]  Do I like secret societies? No. Am I a Mason? No.
[40:57.000 --> 41:00.000]  But most Masons are trying to help the community they're involved.
[41:00.000 --> 41:05.000]  And so the average cop who's a Mason out there, a lot of cops are Masons, a lot of firemen,
[41:05.000 --> 41:09.000]  they hear that and think that them collecting money for kids, you know, that we're saying they're bad.
[41:09.000 --> 41:14.000]  No, we're saying secret society out of Europe known as the Illuminati, George Washington,
[41:14.000 --> 41:18.000]  wrote about it, tried to take over Masonry and did to a great extent
[41:18.000 --> 41:21.000]  and are using it as a tool of dehumanization and enslavement.
[41:21.000 --> 41:26.000]  And we see Mason halls today, pushing the police state, pushing microchips,
[41:26.000 --> 41:29.000]  pushing biometrically scanning children.
[41:29.000 --> 41:34.000]  So yes. And so Masons need to be addressed with the facts
[41:34.000 --> 41:37.000]  so that they will expose what's happening in their own ranks.
[41:37.000 --> 41:41.000]  But if you falsely attack the Masons with disinfo, they will know it's disinfo
[41:41.000 --> 41:45.000]  and then you will be discredited. Does that make your point that you're trying to make there?
[41:45.000 --> 41:48.000]  Yes, sir. And that's what they had one other point there.
[41:48.000 --> 41:53.000]  If people will actually download that article, because I catch it from my scribe, the PDF,
[41:53.000 --> 41:55.000]  it's actually got hyperlinks to those letters you're talking about.
[41:55.000 --> 41:57.000]  So you can actually physically see the letters.
[41:57.000 --> 41:59.000]  And I know a lot of people these days have been so dumbed down,
[41:59.000 --> 42:02.000]  they can't even read cursive handwriting anymore, but there's a transcript below it.
[42:02.000 --> 42:05.000]  So that way people can see for themselves the letters in the original context.
[42:05.000 --> 42:08.000]  Click on the hyperlinks and it goes straight to those files.
[42:08.000 --> 42:12.000]  I appreciate your call, but that's a double-edged sword.
[42:12.000 --> 42:16.000]  Not only is all these letters he wrote, scores of them,
[42:16.000 --> 42:20.000]  I mean, I quit reading after like 20 of them, because they are hard to read.
[42:20.000 --> 42:24.000]  It's written in that longhand beautiful cursive, but with the scans it's hard to read.
[42:24.000 --> 42:28.000]  I'd always read about that in history books. Now I've actually read the letters.
[42:28.000 --> 42:32.000]  Number one, you've got the public believing there's no such thing as the Illuminati.
[42:32.000 --> 42:35.000]  Here's George Washington fighting it.
[42:35.000 --> 42:39.000]  So this proves the Illuminati, not just the fact that it's in the Encyclopedia,
[42:39.000 --> 42:43.000]  but then separately you've got people saying he's a member of the Illuminati when he was fighting it.
[42:43.000 --> 42:47.000]  There's a lot of evidence showing that they actually killed him, poisoned him.
[42:47.000 --> 42:51.000]  Alright, we'll be right back after this quick break to take more of your phone calls.
[42:51.000 --> 42:55.000]  Then the next hour, what's happening in Haiti, the latest on government health care,
[42:55.000 --> 43:20.000]  the White House official wants to restrict your free speech, you don't want to miss it.
[43:20.000 --> 43:25.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[43:25.000 --> 43:29.000]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[43:29.000 --> 43:32.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[43:32.000 --> 43:36.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[43:36.000 --> 43:41.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[43:41.000 --> 43:46.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[43:46.000 --> 43:51.000]  For more information at www.mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com.

[45:07.000 --> 45:12.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[45:12.000 --> 45:18.000]  I've turned an endless influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots.
[45:18.000 --> 45:23.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[45:23.000 --> 45:27.000]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[45:27.000 --> 45:34.000]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[45:34.000 --> 45:38.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches.
[45:38.000 --> 45:41.000]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[45:41.000 --> 45:43.000]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[45:43.000 --> 45:48.000]  And right now in Washington DC, we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[47:00.000 --> 47:04.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[47:04.000 --> 47:08.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[47:08.000 --> 47:19.000]  Okay, here's the deal. I'm going to try to rock it through your calls.
[47:19.000 --> 47:30.000]  But I'm asking listeners, are you concerned about Cass Sunstein, who is Obama's head of information and regulatory affairs,
[47:30.000 --> 47:33.000]  one of the most powerful positions in the executive branch?
[47:33.000 --> 47:38.000]  He interprets the laws for executive implementation.
[47:38.000 --> 47:43.000]  Are you concerned about him openly saying we have all his own papers?
[47:43.000 --> 47:47.000]  Literally everything he's ever written and published at Harvard or at the Chicago Law School.
[47:47.000 --> 47:51.000]  I mean, in the last year or two saying, we're going to take your guns.
[47:51.000 --> 47:56.000]  We're going to ban free speech. We're going to end freedom on the web.
[47:56.000 --> 48:02.000]  I mean, don't believe me. Just Google Cass Sunstein net censor and you'll get ABC news, CNN,
[48:02.000 --> 48:05.000]  saying, oh, should he ban your free speech?
[48:05.000 --> 48:10.000]  And through cybersecurity, the cybersecurity chief last year resigned and said,
[48:10.000 --> 48:13.000]  the NSA and Pentagon is taking over the web to censor it.
[48:13.000 --> 48:15.000]  They're building the systems to do it.
[48:15.000 --> 48:18.000]  I mean, this is really happening.
[48:18.000 --> 48:20.000]  I know it's surreal. I can't believe it.
[48:20.000 --> 48:23.000]  So that's coming up next hour and a lot of other issues we haven't gotten to yet.
[48:23.000 --> 48:25.000]  Healthcare is in deep trouble.
[48:25.000 --> 48:28.000]  They told you it was a foregone conclusion that it would pass.
[48:28.000 --> 48:29.000]  There was no way to stop it.
[48:29.000 --> 48:34.000]  They kind of buffalode the public. Now it's in conference and the Democrats are trying to back out at the last minute
[48:34.000 --> 48:37.000]  because they realize this is political suicide.
[48:37.000 --> 48:39.000]  So put the heat on them.
[48:39.000 --> 48:42.000]  Mark in Texas, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[48:42.000 --> 48:44.000]  Yeah, Alex.
[48:44.000 --> 48:51.000]  I'm a member of we are changed often and we went to the Capitol for a notification rally of
[48:51.000 --> 48:59.000]  socialized government healthcare yesterday, which had to get Debra Medina up on stage really hard.
[48:59.000 --> 49:05.000]  And they ended up just blasting country music until everybody left.
[49:05.000 --> 49:09.000]  So do you want to look out for some video of that?
[49:09.000 --> 49:13.000]  Also, totally unrelated aquaponics.
[49:13.000 --> 49:17.000]  I don't know if you've heard of this, but it's a closed cycle.
[49:17.000 --> 49:25.000]  You make a little ecosystem where you grow freshwater fish and raised vegetables at the same time.
[49:25.000 --> 49:26.000]  Yes, I have heard of it.
[49:26.000 --> 49:30.000]  It can supply 50 billion people on the earth.
[49:30.000 --> 49:40.000]  It's a closed biosphere that just almost has no waste and is self-contained and self renewing.
[49:40.000 --> 49:42.000]  Anything else?
[49:42.000 --> 49:47.000]  Maybe we can get you hooked up with a sponsor for an aquaponics system.
[49:47.000 --> 49:49.000]  I've read about that science.
[49:49.000 --> 49:53.000]  I wasn't particularly aware of that name.
[49:53.000 --> 49:54.000]  But thank you.
[49:54.000 --> 49:55.000]  I appreciate the call, Mark.
[49:55.000 --> 49:57.000]  Okay, let's talk to Joshua.
[49:57.000 --> 49:58.000]  Thank you, Mark.
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.000]  Let's talk to Joshua in Florida.
[50:00.000 --> 50:01.000]  You're on the air.
[50:01.000 --> 50:02.000]  Go ahead.
[50:02.000 --> 50:03.000]  Hey, Alex.
[50:03.000 --> 50:05.000]  Good, sir.
[50:05.000 --> 50:06.000]  What's on your mind?
[50:06.000 --> 50:13.000]  Well, I wanted to talk about it seems like a lot of times within the patriot and truth movement, we're almost fighting ghosts.
[50:13.000 --> 50:15.000]  Like the one-less wiretapping.
[50:15.000 --> 50:18.000]  It's already implemented before the attack.
[50:18.000 --> 50:23.000]  And I'm thinking maybe perhaps we could take some preemptive legislative tactics out.
[50:23.000 --> 50:33.000]  I'm thinking, you know, can we start taking steps to pass state resolutions to go ahead and bar the use of non-immersionary forces or groups?
[50:33.000 --> 50:34.000]  Absolutely.
[50:34.000 --> 50:35.000]  And that's what the states are doing.
[50:35.000 --> 50:40.000]  Look, there have been a bunch of lawsuits by people that were illegally wiretapped into the Patriot Act,
[50:40.000 --> 50:43.000]  and federal judges throw it out international security.
[50:43.000 --> 50:47.000]  So the problem is they admit they're using the Patriot Act in anything but terrorism.
[50:47.000 --> 50:52.000]  They're using it across the board, and the federal judges are so corrupt that it just continues.
[50:52.000 --> 50:55.000]  But think about how bad judges are now.
[50:55.000 --> 51:02.000]  Imagine Cass Sunstein, who's set to be the next Supreme Court justice, openly saying in free speech.
[51:02.000 --> 51:08.000]  I mean, how can you have a Supreme Court justice that doesn't even mince words?
[51:08.000 --> 51:13.000]  You know, he says we can restrict your free speech if it's a conspiracy theory.
[51:13.000 --> 51:18.000]  And he will decide what a conspiracy theory is.
[51:18.000 --> 51:40.000]  Yeah, a lot of folks are going out and saying naked body scanners are good.
[51:40.000 --> 51:43.000]  It's good the banks took 28 trillion.
[51:43.000 --> 51:44.000]  Do what the government says.
[51:44.000 --> 51:46.000]  It's good they're federalizing people.
[51:46.000 --> 51:49.000]  So you're doing this and it's successful.
[51:49.000 --> 51:51.000]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[51:51.000 --> 51:54.000]  And we go to UCF, we go to the University of Central Florida pretty often.
[51:54.000 --> 51:55.000]  We're going next Wednesday.
[51:55.000 --> 51:57.000]  We'll be there doing the same thing.
[51:57.000 --> 51:59.000]  And we always give out a few hundred.
[51:59.000 --> 52:02.000]  You know, last time we went, we gave out about 500 copies of Follow the Republic.
[52:02.000 --> 52:06.000]  And all kind of people are interested in what's going on because we had the Democrats,
[52:06.000 --> 52:08.000]  you know, there couldn't say a word of what we had to say.
[52:08.000 --> 52:10.000]  And then we had the College Republicans.
[52:10.000 --> 52:15.000]  And none of them could debate us on anything because everything we said was accurate.
[52:15.000 --> 52:17.000]  Well, that's why the globalists are in trouble.
[52:17.000 --> 52:28.000]  That's why major magazines, newspapers, TV networks are here every week finding out about this radio show because we are at the heart of what's going on.
[52:28.000 --> 52:30.000]  We are certainly not responsible for it.
[52:30.000 --> 52:35.000]  We are not, you know, the main focus of it, but we are at the heart of it right at the nexus point.
[52:35.000 --> 52:37.000]  And we can see what's happening.
[52:37.000 --> 52:40.000]  And so many people feel isolated because they're not known.
[52:40.000 --> 52:43.000]  A lot of people know what I look like now.
[52:43.000 --> 52:46.000]  And so everywhere I go, I get the positive feedback.
[52:46.000 --> 52:49.000]  I get my dinner bot in other cities, other states.
[52:49.000 --> 52:57.000]  I get piles of fan mail and you go out and you put out a message of liberty and you're saying most people come up to you and agree with you.
[52:57.000 --> 52:59.000]  See, we are the majority.
[52:59.000 --> 53:00.000]  We are the common sense.
[53:00.000 --> 53:02.000]  We are the revolution against tyranny.
[53:02.000 --> 53:04.000]  I appreciate your call, Joshua.
[53:04.000 --> 53:07.000]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Ashley in Dallas.
[53:07.000 --> 53:09.000]  Ashley, you're on the air.
[53:09.000 --> 53:12.000]  Hey, Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[53:12.000 --> 53:16.000]  Hey, listen, we're real similar on the standpoint of both Texans and both raised here in Texas.
[53:16.000 --> 53:19.000]  And our family's been here forever, basically.
[53:19.000 --> 53:22.000]  My family's had land here in Texas for 150 years.
[53:22.000 --> 53:25.000]  But I want to give you a list of names and I want to get your response to this.
[53:25.000 --> 53:34.000]  Larry Silverstein, Richard Pearl, Erie Flescher, Paul Wilpelich, Douglas Fife, Jules and Jeremy Crowell, Rob Childs, Nancy Pelosi, Michael Churdoff.
[53:34.000 --> 53:42.000]  I mean, on and on, Henry Kissinger, Michael Eisner, Steve Bernstein, and Bernstein, ABC News, Sunder Redstone.
[53:42.000 --> 53:44.000]  Cass Sunstein.
[53:44.000 --> 53:45.000]  Yes.
[53:45.000 --> 53:47.000]  I know where you're going with this.
[53:47.000 --> 53:52.000]  Okay, and I'm not being critical of you, Alex, because I followed you, understand?
[53:52.000 --> 53:53.000]  I defend you and I'm with you.
[53:53.000 --> 53:54.000]  You understand me?
[53:54.000 --> 53:56.000]  But listen, Ashley, it's okay.
[53:56.000 --> 53:58.000]  I mean, hold on, Ashley.
[53:58.000 --> 54:00.000]  Nobody screams your call, right?
[54:00.000 --> 54:01.000]  Nobody did.
[54:01.000 --> 54:03.000]  Nobody did.
[54:03.000 --> 54:04.000]  Nope.
[54:04.000 --> 54:05.000]  Okay, so you're on the air.
[54:05.000 --> 54:06.000]  Go ahead.
[54:06.000 --> 54:07.000]  Say what you want to say.
[54:07.000 --> 54:10.000]  Well, I mean, what do these people have in common?
[54:10.000 --> 54:13.000]  Well, you're saying they're Jewish.
[54:13.000 --> 54:20.000]  They're Zionists, Jews, and they're all heavily involved in both our government, our media, and 9-11.
[54:20.000 --> 54:22.000]  And we don't talk about that as a group.
[54:22.000 --> 54:23.000]  Why?
[54:23.000 --> 54:29.000]  Well, again, an incredibly complex issue.
[54:29.000 --> 54:32.000]  There are a lot of people in government.
[54:32.000 --> 54:41.000]  And if we start sitting there and cherry picking, I mean, there are people that say Catholics run it all.
[54:41.000 --> 54:45.000]  And they can list thousands of Catholics in powerful positions of government.
[54:45.000 --> 54:51.000]  There's people that say Masons run it all and point out thousands of Masons in powerful positions of government.
[54:51.000 --> 54:57.000]  Or there are people that say Mormons run it all and point out all the Mormons, you know, 2% of the population in all these powerful positions.
[54:57.000 --> 55:05.000]  Clearly, you know, my point is there's socialist Jews, there's conservative Jews, there's liberal Jews.
[55:05.000 --> 55:12.000]  I mean, are there groups of Jewish people that go to college, get into government, who are pushing tyranny?
[55:12.000 --> 55:13.000]  Absolutely.
[55:13.000 --> 55:20.000]  But I don't think sitting here and making it something that's all and only about Jews is healthy.
[55:20.000 --> 55:21.000]  I don't scream people's calls.
[55:21.000 --> 55:27.000]  We criticize Israel when they stage the attack on the U.S. as liberty, which has now been declassified in S.A. transcripts.
[55:27.000 --> 55:28.000]  We were proven correct.
[55:28.000 --> 55:31.000]  I interviewed the admirals and the people on the ship and all of them.
[55:31.000 --> 55:33.000]  They tried to sink the ship to blame it on Egypt.
[55:33.000 --> 55:35.000]  A false flag event.
[55:35.000 --> 55:38.000]  And here's my other problem.
[55:38.000 --> 55:44.000]  I don't like a lot of things Israel does, but I also don't like the things, not the white supremacist.
[55:44.000 --> 55:46.000]  Everybody that criticizes Israel is not a white supremacist.
[55:46.000 --> 55:49.000]  And the media tries to put that idea out.
[55:49.000 --> 55:51.000]  I mean, Jimmy Carter did.
[55:51.000 --> 55:54.000]  But the issue here is they also exaggerate a lot.
[55:54.000 --> 56:03.000]  I mean, the Nazis and the Jews run it all around the crowd say, I'm Jewish and that I work for Israel, which is not true.
[56:03.000 --> 56:15.000]  And so I've seen a lot of lies and particular nastiness and lies out of the groups that say that.
[56:15.000 --> 56:20.000]  And I see them make up a lot like, like they say Jones is a Jewish name and I'm Jewish and I'm not.
[56:20.000 --> 56:24.000]  But I have, you know, a Jewish guy works my office, love him to death.
[56:24.000 --> 56:29.000]  One of my favorite friends and employees and he's not involved in some master conspiracy.
[56:29.000 --> 56:33.000]  Let me get this straight because I've said it before and get it wrong.
[56:33.000 --> 56:38.000]  My wife's grandfather was Jewish, Jewish farmers in Texas.
[56:38.000 --> 56:39.000]  Nice people.
[56:39.000 --> 56:41.000]  I mean, they're not running around with some evil plan.
[56:41.000 --> 56:44.000]  My wife is a Christian Protestant.
[56:44.000 --> 56:49.000]  People say my wife needs to basically be killed and she's this big Jewish agent and all this.
[56:49.000 --> 56:56.000]  So I'm not going to sit here and get into mass hatred of Jews.
[56:56.000 --> 57:02.000]  And I'm not, I'm going to talk about the Federal Reserve being private and ruining our country and call for abolishing it.
[57:02.000 --> 57:04.000]  I'm going to call for auditing the Fed.
[57:04.000 --> 57:06.000]  I'm going to call for ending these wars.
[57:06.000 --> 57:08.000]  I'm going to call to stop foreign aid.
[57:08.000 --> 57:13.000]  I'm going to call to support free speech and I'm going to expose tyranny.
[57:13.000 --> 57:16.000]  And I expose the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, all of it.
[57:16.000 --> 57:19.000]  And certainly the Rothschilds are Jewish and are at the very highest levels in the New World Order.
[57:19.000 --> 57:20.000]  So is the Vatican.
[57:20.000 --> 57:24.000]  But it's not just Jews or the Vatican or black people or this or that.
[57:24.000 --> 57:28.000]  It is powerful elites, combined forces.
[57:28.000 --> 57:30.000]  I mean, the Aztecs were doing bad things.
[57:30.000 --> 57:31.000]  Were they run by Jews?
[57:31.000 --> 57:36.000]  This idea that only evil flows from Jews and there's only corruption from Jews is wrong.
[57:36.000 --> 57:41.000]  Okay, but I do expose the myriad crimes of Israel to great criticism.
[57:41.000 --> 57:42.000]  The ADL attacks me all the time.
[57:42.000 --> 57:43.000]  Stay there.
[57:43.000 --> 58:12.000]  I'm going to come back to you in just one minute.
[58:13.000 --> 58:37.000]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
