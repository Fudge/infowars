[00:00.000 --> 00:29.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well so does he
[00:30.720 --> 00:35.440]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[00:38.080 --> 00:45.200]  it's friday february 24th 2023 i am here in battle host alex jones thanking you all
[00:45.200 --> 00:49.840]  however you're tuning in for joining us and reminding you the real power of we the people
[00:49.840 --> 00:53.280]  is your word of mouth and your human intelligence when you take action and spread the word
[00:53.280 --> 01:02.000]  and conspiracy fact.info and info wars.com and video it truly changes the world all right
[01:02.720 --> 01:09.280]  thank you so much for joining us on this friday edition big broadcast with some huge
[01:09.280 --> 01:16.080]  guests coming up later today i'll be telling you about but what is today today is a very
[01:16.080 --> 01:26.480]  important day obviously today is the one-year anniversary of the launching of latimer putin's
[01:27.200 --> 01:36.000]  so-called police action or special military operation in to ukraine and the kickoff of
[01:36.000 --> 01:42.720]  what has now become the beginning of world war three and all of the things that that entails
[01:42.720 --> 01:48.080]  we'll be spending some time on that today obviously but in the first hour i want to talk
[01:48.080 --> 01:53.680]  about the other wars that are going on the wars the culture wars who's running it what's behind
[01:53.680 --> 02:02.160]  it because at ground level the culture wars are very real if you're a very unlucky very rare by
[02:02.160 --> 02:08.080]  the way black person that is actually killed by the kkk and drug behind a truck until your head
[02:08.080 --> 02:15.120]  comes off like happened in a real texas case 15 years ago or so then that's a real race war for you
[02:16.080 --> 02:21.440]  and if you're a white person statistically 20 plus times more likely to be attacked by a black
[02:21.440 --> 02:25.840]  person and for a black person to be attacked by a white person according to the fbis of statistics
[02:25.840 --> 02:31.520]  that's a very real war at the ground level but still the number of white people killed by black
[02:31.520 --> 02:39.280]  people is tiny compared to all of us dying from these poison shots that have taken them
[02:39.280 --> 02:44.480]  and getting sick and the chemicals and the biologicals the radiologicals being introduced
[02:44.480 --> 02:51.680]  in our environments and the 5g and just all the gmo crops and the glyphosates and the dioxins
[02:51.680 --> 02:58.960]  that's the real problem and look it's real red meat i can show you 20 videos today that are new
[02:58.960 --> 03:05.760]  of racist out of control crazy black people beating up pushing white people on the railroad tracks
[03:06.320 --> 03:12.800]  killing white people i can also show you 30 videos that are new today of black people killing black
[03:12.800 --> 03:18.640]  people those don't seem to be as hot on the internet and the bottom line is there is a minority of
[03:18.640 --> 03:26.000]  black people a minority of that minority in this country that are viciously racist and that are
[03:26.000 --> 03:30.640]  attacking white people and the way the media covers it up and all the rest of it is terrible
[03:30.640 --> 03:36.720]  and it's the media helping drive it but i want to put in context this today that the people
[03:36.720 --> 03:43.600]  attacking us all are the real issues and i'm not an apologist for black on white crime in fact the
[03:43.600 --> 03:49.840]  contrary we talk a lot about it but it's almost like covering the ohio trained irrelevant saying
[03:49.840 --> 03:53.440]  it's the biggest news story it is important the government not caring is important but
[03:53.440 --> 03:56.400]  compared to world war three or the poison shots doesn't even show up on the rickshaw
[03:57.120 --> 04:00.160]  doesn't mean i don't care about ohio and it's the same thing so
[04:02.240 --> 04:06.560]  the numbers of white people being killed by blacks every year is over 10 000 or so that
[04:06.560 --> 04:10.320]  sounds like a big number but out of 350 million people it's a problem
[04:12.400 --> 04:20.320]  but it is tiny compared to again how the whole new world order agenda is attacking everybody but
[04:20.320 --> 04:26.480]  what the global is pushing the race war and how that fits into their larger control system
[04:27.840 --> 04:34.080]  is one of the top issues because the division it creates and the way it allows them to control
[04:34.080 --> 04:39.680]  people and divide society and divide and conquer that's the big one what made me really want to
[04:39.680 --> 04:43.360]  talk about this i was already talking about the last few days is scott adams i think it's a smart
[04:43.360 --> 04:51.200]  guy i like scott adams but he came out with something that he knows is a massive troll and
[04:51.200 --> 04:56.240]  that would get a lot of attention and part of what he says i think is accurate but we'll talk about
[04:56.240 --> 05:06.320]  when we come back right now i'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to info
[05:06.320 --> 05:11.040]  or store.com and gotten the great products that enrich your life that empower your immune system
[05:11.040 --> 05:17.040]  in your body and keep us on air i am humbly had in hand talking to the viewers and listeners that

[06:08.960 --> 06:20.080]  all the hip young things trying to make the scene
[06:20.080 --> 06:39.680]  it's friday february 24th 2023 i'm your host alex jones very honored you've chosen to join us today
[06:39.680 --> 06:46.560]  with your very important precious time well here we are on the one year anniversary 12 months ago
[06:46.560 --> 06:52.480]  today the russians launched their invasion of ukraine and it was a massive invasion and putin
[06:52.480 --> 06:57.200]  walked right into a bear trap of the cia and nato with high tech missiles and weapons and
[06:57.200 --> 07:03.280]  satellite directed weapons and absolutely slaughtered the russians it's probably over 100 000 that's a
[07:03.280 --> 07:11.600]  low estimate but the russians have doggedly continued on and killed the reports are 200 000
[07:11.600 --> 07:17.840]  ukranians which is terrible and the whole thing is a disaster and is another example of humanity
[07:17.840 --> 07:23.120]  being played off against each other we'll be talking more about that here on the broadcast today
[07:23.120 --> 07:30.640]  but i want to talk about the other wars going on the electromagnetic 5g the radiation the toxicity
[07:30.640 --> 07:37.120]  the bisphenol the dioxins the gender-bending chemicals the cancer exploding millions dead
[07:37.120 --> 07:42.800]  from the poison shots tens of millions sick global government mass censorship control
[07:44.080 --> 07:48.640]  and if you look at europe or you look at the united states the globalists admit they don't
[07:48.640 --> 07:54.880]  want a wealthy large middle class and for people in africa in latin america in asia in the middle east
[07:54.880 --> 08:01.680]  to aspire to owning a home with a two-car garage and two cars and going on vacation three times a
[08:01.680 --> 08:08.560]  year and having access to medical care they don't want the gluttonous wasteful western american
[08:08.560 --> 08:14.160]  idea of progress they admit that they're at war against it the tiny elite want you poor and so
[08:14.160 --> 08:21.360]  how did 10 000 on average british soldiers in the subcontinent of india in the last few hundred
[08:21.360 --> 08:26.320]  years control hundreds of millions of people millions today but they haven't controlled
[08:26.320 --> 08:32.800]  things since mohammed ghandi they did it by divide and conquer and using sociology and anthropology
[08:33.600 --> 08:38.640]  to study the local tribal rifts and groups and even though genetically the indians are a very
[08:43.120 --> 08:48.160]  genetically similar group 10 000 british soldiers on average
[08:49.360 --> 08:56.240]  conquered and held for hundreds of years and exploited that subcontinent so it's the same thing
[08:56.240 --> 09:02.080]  now villagers had real issues with each other you know somebody's grandpa killed somebody's daddy
[09:02.080 --> 09:07.200]  somebody's mama married somebody in the wrong tribe and the british would go in for a few years
[09:07.200 --> 09:12.400]  stay the situation bring in some money buy off key leaders form alliances and take full control
[09:14.960 --> 09:21.200]  and that's what this is from the 35 000 foot view shipping in 30 million muslims in new europe
[09:21.200 --> 09:29.520]  the last 15 years shipping in 60 70 million illegal aliens into the united states the last 30 years
[09:31.440 --> 09:36.800]  and then hyping them up towards anti-american anti-white inclinations all of that is real
[09:37.440 --> 09:43.520]  but it's a mechanism of the control now i'm not some bleeding heart liberal that wants to kiss
[09:43.520 --> 09:47.840]  black people's ass and try to curry favor and tell them how much i like them and all the rest of
[09:47.840 --> 09:53.840]  that i see people as people of what they stand for who they are in their lives i don't listen
[09:53.840 --> 09:58.080]  to jimmy hindricks because he was black i listen to him because he's probably the greatest guitarist
[09:58.080 --> 10:06.800]  and songwriter ever or one of the greats i don't listen to luben von Beethoven because he was german
[10:08.240 --> 10:11.440]  and i'm about half german i listen to him because he's an incredible
[10:11.440 --> 10:21.200]  musician and a composer it's the same thing i don't go to a chinese food restaurant to
[10:21.200 --> 10:26.000]  virtually signal the chinese people i go there if it's a real chinese food and delicious
[10:28.000 --> 10:31.920]  i go eat soul food when i got time in east austin even though it's dangerous because they got the
[10:31.920 --> 10:38.480]  best collard greens and chicken fried steaks and sweet potatoes i'm out there to virtually signal
[10:38.480 --> 10:45.440]  the black people i'm there to eat that food so bottom line folks i know black people real well
[10:46.720 --> 10:53.600]  i grew up in dallas texas it's half black most of black people were fun and cool and nice and
[10:53.600 --> 11:01.920]  loved me but i've been racially attacked let's not exaggerate 50 times because i was white
[11:02.880 --> 11:08.080]  do i blame the rest of black people for that no but also because i wanted the wrong bonfire and
[11:08.080 --> 11:14.160]  the wrong redneck area i've been in about 25 fights attacked by rednecks looked just like me
[11:14.160 --> 11:19.280]  wearing cowboy hats and cowboy boots but i was there didn't know the girl i brought had broke
[11:19.280 --> 11:24.080]  up with somebody six months before all of a sudden i got somebody hit me in the head with a pair of
[11:24.080 --> 11:30.880]  post cold diggers does that mean i anytime i see people wearing cowboy hats and cowboy boots i get
[11:30.880 --> 11:39.600]  all scared and think they're about to attack me no but yes ladies and gentlemen i didn't even
[11:39.600 --> 11:44.320]  realize it growing up my parents weren't liberal politically correct they just said you can just
[11:44.320 --> 11:50.880]  go be tough but i i guarantee you there aren't any black people listening to this show that have
[11:50.880 --> 11:55.200]  been attacked by white people physically 50 times i'll bet you all the money on earth is there any
[11:55.200 --> 12:01.920]  black person that's been been attacked by black people 50 times by the way i'm a tough son of
[12:01.920 --> 12:12.720]  a bitch because of that i've had concussions so bad i couldn't see for a week and i beat black
[12:12.720 --> 12:20.240]  people and put them in comas because when you're fighting for your life that's what you do i had
[12:20.240 --> 12:28.640]  five mexicans break my leg when i was 16 do i eat mexicans no that's a whole other story
[12:30.640 --> 12:36.400]  but the point is ladies and gentlemen the people manipulating this from the top
[12:38.960 --> 12:45.840]  know exactly what they're doing so when a horde of muslims come out of their no go zones in
[12:45.840 --> 12:54.480]  belgium or in paris france or in london england and beat and stab and kill and rape in some towns
[12:54.480 --> 13:00.000]  thousands of white girls per town the police turn a blind eye because you're not allowed to say
[13:00.000 --> 13:06.080]  muslims do something wrong they call them asian grooming gangs so we've all got beasts
[13:07.600 --> 13:11.680]  and i don't want to hear black people whine and bitch at me for something white people
[13:11.680 --> 13:15.680]  did hundreds of years ago and i don't want to hear about your reparations for something i didn't do
[13:15.680 --> 13:23.680]  if my daddy was a murderer i don't go to jail for it if my grandma robs a bank i don't go to jail
[13:23.680 --> 13:28.640]  for it if my great great great great great great great great great great great great great grand
[13:28.640 --> 13:32.560]  daddy and hell i don't know they did had slaves that's not my fault
[13:35.600 --> 13:38.240]  any more so than if somebody three doors down from you
[13:38.240 --> 13:45.680]  you murders their life with a butcher knife do you go to jail the answer is hell no
[13:46.720 --> 13:50.000]  and what brings me to this point to understand this war of psychological control
[13:51.440 --> 13:56.400]  is you got to recognize that the left and hollywood and the whole culture says white people are
[13:56.400 --> 14:01.600]  evil and they're bad and they deserve to die and so there's a minority of young black males
[14:01.600 --> 14:06.160]  that are out with a knockout game and pushing people on railroad tracks and pushing people on
[14:06.160 --> 14:10.240]  subway tracks and stabbing and shooting people yeah that's going on ladies and gentlemen
[14:12.080 --> 14:18.000]  and robbing and killing and stealing it just like it was white people doing it in the roaring 1920s
[14:18.000 --> 14:22.080]  and the gangsters because it was cool and because of police lost control
[14:25.360 --> 14:29.280]  so is there a dangerous gangster culture in america predominantly in the black community hell
[14:29.280 --> 14:35.920]  yeah has the left-mitted open season to attack white people hell yeah is the control corporate
[14:35.920 --> 14:41.200]  media all over the news saying white people are bad and they're inherently evil is there a rasmussen
[14:41.200 --> 14:49.680]  pullout where almost a majority of black people that they talk to fundamentally believe because
[14:49.680 --> 15:01.440]  someone's skin is white they are a bad person so how does the media call people that don't support
[15:01.440 --> 15:07.040]  tyranny or wars nazis when george soros literally worked for the nazis and runs the whole current
[15:07.040 --> 15:13.520]  system and then how do they create racial division in this country is the left and then turn around
[15:13.520 --> 15:17.920]  and call us all races when they're obviously the race pimps controlling it that's when i'm getting
[15:17.920 --> 15:24.000]  it so when we come back scott adams puts out a video that's gone mega viral i won't try to get
[15:24.000 --> 15:31.120]  him on the show he's been on before and says you better get away from black people and you better
[15:31.120 --> 15:43.120]  run from them is that really the answer because you can run all day long from your problems
[15:43.120 --> 15:46.640]  but until you engage those problems it's not going to get better it's going to get worse
[15:46.640 --> 15:51.040]  we're going to play this clip we're going to come back we're going to talk about it on the other side
[15:51.040 --> 16:17.040]  no black people are not the problem evil is the problem
[16:17.040 --> 16:22.000]  at bookstores amazon or info or short dot com but you will never be able to get another signed copy

[19:53.760 --> 20:05.760]  say no and we say no to your war leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's
[20:05.760 --> 20:19.520]  alex jones welcome back to this friday edition of the alex jones show big guests coming up second
[20:19.520 --> 20:28.880]  third hour today all right so dillbert crater scott adams warns white people get the hell away
[20:28.880 --> 20:36.320]  from blacks his polls show they're not okay with being white and you know we've sold t shirts that
[20:36.320 --> 20:43.040]  say it's okay to be white but the shirt i really like was it's great to be black it's great to be
[20:43.040 --> 20:48.080]  brown it's great to be yellow it's great to be white it's great to be human the whole way the
[20:48.080 --> 20:52.960]  globalist wind is dividing us but it is true that i wouldn't want to live in a high crime area
[20:52.960 --> 20:58.000]  regardless of it was a mixed high crime area mainly a black high crime area because there's a high level
[20:58.000 --> 21:03.360]  of criminals there who are also mainly the most dangerous person to a black person other than
[21:03.360 --> 21:09.680]  an abortionist doctor is black people you think the average black guy that works as a
[21:11.840 --> 21:20.880]  waiter or as a bus driver uh or as an auto mechanic with three kids think he hates white people who
[21:20.880 --> 21:25.040]  wants to kill white people and want no he works a couple white guys down at the down at the auto
[21:25.040 --> 21:31.040]  repair shop and then a black guy goes against a couple degrees and goes and moves to a nicer
[21:31.040 --> 21:36.480]  house when people call him a sellout this is all the garbage that goes on ladies and gentlemen
[21:36.480 --> 21:41.040]  and we all know about it and we all understand it we need to see where it's coming from well i said
[21:41.040 --> 21:46.080]  we all know a lot of us don't know and so i don't blame people for getting away from high crime
[21:46.080 --> 21:53.360]  areas no matter what color you are but defunding the police all of this is designed to create this
[21:53.360 --> 21:58.080]  crime wave you got the new black panther party saying i've had one of the guys on that says
[21:58.080 --> 22:02.560]  this openly in houston don't go out and mug black people go mug white people that's a message and
[22:02.560 --> 22:07.680]  that's happening and a lot of black folks get killed trying to rob white people they need to stop
[22:08.480 --> 22:15.200]  and i'm decrying that but scott adams is saying the quiet part out loud that some of you're saying
[22:15.200 --> 22:20.400]  that were white liberals that were going along with oh let's be really nice let's lift everybody up
[22:20.400 --> 22:25.360]  and then all they see is it blowing up in their face so they say oh let's just not be around black
[22:25.360 --> 22:32.160]  people you say well that's super racist well the college is all over the place the left is
[22:33.520 --> 22:38.480]  segregating black people telling them to segregate sell segregate saying oh whites can't come to
[22:38.480 --> 22:43.840]  college this weekend it's only for minorities the left is creating this chip on the shoulder
[22:43.840 --> 22:49.280]  scenario you see all the examples everywhere hundreds of movies a year about slavery and white
[22:49.280 --> 22:56.000]  slave owners in jango and on and on and on and weak minded people watch that and they listen
[22:56.000 --> 23:00.960]  to black lives matter with its george soros ideology and they go out and they hate white people
[23:01.520 --> 23:05.520]  i was talking to norm paddus last night he's a liberal he's been there for months with the
[23:05.520 --> 23:12.400]  proud boys trial in dc his co-counsel for no reason is an old white guy black guy comes up and says
[23:12.400 --> 23:20.400]  i hate you white people drink and die at coke and knocks his front teeth up norm paddus has gone in
[23:20.400 --> 23:26.000]  a store because he's a jogger and his shoe soul came off he went in the store of macy's to buy
[23:26.000 --> 23:30.080]  some shoes and the black people said we're not going to serve you you're a white person
[23:30.080 --> 23:34.320]  he's coming on the show sunday to talk about it he says he wants to get the hell out of there
[23:34.320 --> 23:39.360]  not because he dislikes black people because they don't want him there and and this is what
[23:39.360 --> 23:42.880]  the culture has created and let's just be honest about it
[23:46.480 --> 23:51.120]  but the answer is exposing the ideology the answer is getting in the face of the ideology
[23:52.080 --> 23:55.200]  because let me tell you what happens when i go in a black area
[23:56.720 --> 24:01.680]  see the black people don't know who the average white guy is in their neighborhood and most of
[24:01.680 --> 24:06.640]  them are nice but there's a good portion that aren't extremely racist and will say things to you
[24:06.640 --> 24:12.320]  go go try it for yourself tells your cracker head doing there's going to beat your ass you'll get
[24:12.320 --> 24:15.440]  the hell out of here you talk back you're going to get knocked upside the head
[24:19.760 --> 24:20.960]  doesn't happen with alex jones
[24:23.520 --> 24:27.440]  i go in a black neighborhood you've seen it on tv when i'm out in crowds all the place new york
[24:28.960 --> 24:32.160]  a bunch of black people know i am they love me and they run oh we love alex jones and the other
[24:32.160 --> 24:36.720]  black people go well he must be cool see see because then oh the black people like him he must be nice
[24:36.720 --> 24:40.960]  well then they don't dislike me because somebody did something racist to them or somebody discriminating
[24:40.960 --> 24:46.240]  against them or the media opened that wound up over and over again so see i get to have that experience
[24:49.200 --> 24:51.920]  that people that aren't well known or aren't famous don't know
[24:53.680 --> 24:56.240]  you know how many black college we have on the show they know all about the new world or they
[24:56.240 --> 25:00.000]  know about being screwed over they've been screwed over and now the same system says it wants to
[25:00.000 --> 25:04.160]  help them and it's screwing them over even more by manipulating some of the weak-minded people in
[25:04.160 --> 25:12.320]  their race to go out and act like a bunch of black versions of the kkk kkk thought it was under
[25:12.320 --> 25:17.120]  attack kkk thought it was in the right kkk didn't like seeing black people have cars and jobs and
[25:17.120 --> 25:23.600]  restaurants and businesses they own so they go burn them down and that's what the race is black
[25:23.600 --> 25:29.920]  people that are racist think because the media told them so and they're taking what martin Luther
[25:29.920 --> 25:37.520]  king rightfully stood for and flushing it down the toilet so i get what mike what what what
[25:37.520 --> 25:42.640]  scott adams is saying but i'll see mike adams scott adams is saying but i think there's a bigger
[25:42.640 --> 25:47.840]  picture here but you can't call him a racist when the left saying whites are inherently bad and it's
[25:47.840 --> 25:51.840]  not okay to be white and almost 50 percent of blacks in this rhapsody is involved you know they
[25:51.840 --> 25:58.320]  hold liberals said that this is a system turned in the knife dividing us controlling us so we're
[25:58.320 --> 26:04.480]  distracted while they screw us over here it is rasmussen asked you know white and black voters
[26:05.680 --> 26:12.400]  and and probably others uh do you disagree or agree with a statement it's okay to be white
[26:12.400 --> 26:27.440]  26 of blacks said no it's not okay to be white 21 weren't sure add them together that is 47
[26:27.440 --> 26:34.080]  percent of black respondents were not willing to say it's okay to be white so if if you know
[26:34.080 --> 26:40.400]  nearly half of all blacks are not okay with white people according to this poll not according to me
[26:40.400 --> 26:47.600]  according to this poll uh that's a hate group that's a hate group and i don't want to have anything
[26:47.600 --> 26:54.400]  to do with them and i would say you know based on the current way things are going the best advice
[26:54.400 --> 27:02.320]  i would give to white people is to get the hell away from black people just get away wherever you
[27:02.320 --> 27:11.600]  have to go just get away because there's no fixing this this can't be fixed all right this can't be
[27:11.600 --> 27:17.360]  fixed you just have to escape so that's what i did i went to a neighborhood where you know i have a
[27:17.360 --> 27:22.720]  very low black population because unfortunately there you know there's a high correlation between
[27:22.720 --> 27:28.640]  the density and this is according to don lemon by the way um so here i'm just quoting don lemon
[27:28.640 --> 27:36.560]  when when he notes that the when he lived in a mostly black neighborhood there were a bunch
[27:36.560 --> 27:44.160]  of problems that he didn't see in white neighborhoods so even don lemon sees a big difference in your
[27:44.160 --> 27:50.640]  own quality of living based on where you live and who's there so i think it makes no sense
[27:50.640 --> 27:58.320]  whatsoever as a white citizen of america to try to help black citizens anymore it doesn't make
[27:58.320 --> 28:08.640]  sense it's no longer a rational impulse and so i'm i'm gonna i'm gonna back off from being helpful
[28:08.640 --> 28:14.720]  to black america because it doesn't seem like it pays off like i've been doing it all my life
[28:14.720 --> 28:22.160]  and have been the only outcome is i i get called a racist and that's what the left wants is it's
[28:22.160 --> 28:26.400]  all divided different groups it doesn't mean when the left says we represent black people and here's
[28:26.400 --> 28:31.600]  their demands no that's the left controlling groups and claiming that they represent them
[28:32.400 --> 28:39.440]  so i get not one little high crime area regardless who lives there but to say oh i'm not gonna help
[28:39.440 --> 28:46.160]  blacks what does that even mean what does that mean like you're gonna judge other black people
[28:46.160 --> 28:53.840]  completely off of what other black people do i mean i get it young black males a large minority
[28:53.840 --> 28:58.560]  of them but it's a it's a chunk are absolutely out of control but you're gonna blame

[33:13.280 --> 33:17.280]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[33:17.280 --> 33:33.440]  from deep in the heart of fema region six austin texas transmitting worldwide it's alex jones
[33:36.800 --> 33:38.880]  we're live ladies and gentlemen coming up
[33:38.880 --> 33:46.640]  a special big guest today a shroyen studio as well co-hosting
[33:48.080 --> 33:54.480]  i'm your host alex jones all right so scott adams if he wants to not live around black people
[33:54.480 --> 34:00.080]  that's his right and if people want to live away from crime period wherever it's coming from
[34:00.080 --> 34:04.080]  i totally get it but to say i'm done with black people they hate me
[34:04.080 --> 34:11.440]  so i don't like them well you're it's only 20 some percent that said they definitely don't like
[34:11.440 --> 34:15.360]  white people 20 some percent said they weren't sure because they're like well i'm politically
[34:15.360 --> 34:21.120]  correct i'm supposed to just like whites right so we're gonna take 50 percent or more and then
[34:21.120 --> 34:27.600]  say well they're all bad that's how the globalist play us off against each other that's like yay
[34:27.600 --> 34:35.040]  today here's his props when he was in here in december last year with the yuhu netin yuhu
[34:35.040 --> 34:40.640]  netin yahoo and just because he's had some bad experiences with jews in hollywood
[34:41.440 --> 34:46.400]  not all of hollywood's horrible he just says all jews are mad or he doesn't trust them
[34:48.080 --> 34:51.360]  and it's been the left promoting this idea that white people are inherently bad
[34:51.360 --> 34:58.880]  so if jews are white well how can the left say white people are bad inherently evil because
[34:58.880 --> 35:07.040]  their skin color but then jews are okay i'm not defending what yay said here i disagree with
[35:07.040 --> 35:14.640]  him when he was here but i couldn't get that upset one of you tuned into cnn their anti white bias
[35:14.640 --> 35:22.640]  mainly white people teaching blacks how to believe that brainwashing them it's the same thing absolutely
[35:22.640 --> 35:34.320]  the same garbage over and over and over again and then you got people
[35:37.280 --> 35:41.680]  like john stewart his brother used to run the new york stock exchange big insider
[35:41.680 --> 35:47.920]  saying alex jones is a wolf in wolf's clothing but that fox news is the real enemy needs to be
[35:47.920 --> 35:55.840]  taken off the year and then he goes on to talk about how the right wing is exploiting our freedoms
[35:55.840 --> 36:01.040]  and creating divisions and rifts i don't have time to play the whole podcast i watched most of it
[36:01.040 --> 36:08.560]  last night it's like a 45 minutes long and it's the left openly opening wounds and rubbing salt
[36:08.560 --> 36:15.440]  in them and exploiting we all know that anybody can see that they they're doing 95 of it the only
[36:15.440 --> 36:21.760]  thing republicans are really bad on is warmongering but you look me look at the left man pedophilia
[36:21.760 --> 36:28.400]  just open borders everything bad creating total division brainwashing little white kids they're
[36:28.400 --> 36:34.400]  inherently bad because of their skin color i mean wow those kids are gonna be screwed up for life and
[36:34.400 --> 36:40.880]  this is going on to purge our military to purge everything to divide and conquer and on the most
[36:40.880 --> 36:45.280]  evil guy in the world because i questioned sandy hook and then they hired a pr firm after trump got
[36:45.280 --> 36:49.520]  elected and hyped it up i was doing things to him i didn't ever do and then had judges find me guilty
[36:49.520 --> 36:54.000]  and told juries i was guilty and i would be found guilty and then oh you owe billions of dollars
[36:54.000 --> 36:59.120]  you know we don't have we don't have millions of dollars this is how the system operates
[36:59.120 --> 37:03.360]  with its branding and its deception so their branding whites is all evil and races that need
[37:03.360 --> 37:08.560]  to be attacked and then blacks started tagging whites and the left sits back to referee at all
[37:08.560 --> 37:12.880]  like a warden in a prison where they control people through the different racial groups that's all
[37:12.880 --> 37:20.320]  this is is prison management systems of racial gangs or the gangs of new york being projected
[37:20.320 --> 37:26.480]  over the whole world it's being done everywhere they use muslims in europe to do it as very real
[37:26.480 --> 37:29.360]  the muslims are coming to rape and kill you and they do it all the time and it's defended and
[37:29.360 --> 37:36.160]  protected but but who's behind it the john stewart's of the world john stewart's a nasty person
[37:36.800 --> 37:42.480]  he knows exactly what he's doing he picks a few charities that look good and care about 9-11 in
[37:42.480 --> 37:47.280]  the dust right about the bombs of the buildings john you know damn well about it
[37:49.600 --> 37:53.680]  so he can be up there on this big moral high ground so everything he says about me
[37:53.680 --> 38:03.760]  is him here it is a piece of what might concern us about the the sort of ingrained nature of
[38:04.560 --> 38:11.280]  these media models is that um do we get to a place in which the outcome of defamation
[38:11.280 --> 38:17.040]  laws can't can't serve that remedial purpose that we describe so one place in which i've
[38:17.040 --> 38:21.440]  been following this closely in the last six months or so is um alex jones who has also
[38:21.440 --> 38:27.920]  been involved in a prominent defamation suit involving sandy hook parents suggesting that they
[38:27.920 --> 38:34.160]  were um that sort of paid actors who pretended that their children had been the victims of mass
[38:34.160 --> 38:43.600]  murder and the uh you know we have um defamation damages running in the millions uh and there's
[38:43.600 --> 38:51.280]  still um some very strong suggestion that this moved the needle not at all in terms of the beliefs
[38:51.280 --> 38:56.000]  of the listening audience but that's not that should never be the standard the standard can
[38:56.000 --> 39:00.480]  never be uh what we put out there will move the needle and i'll go you one further alex
[39:00.480 --> 39:08.160]  jones is a far less pernicious influence on this country than fox news by far uh people know what
[39:08.160 --> 39:14.320]  that cat is uh you know they they know if it looks like a duck sounds like a dog walks like like
[39:14.320 --> 39:17.600]  they know what that is now that doesn't mean he doesn't have influence and that doesn't mean that
[39:17.600 --> 39:24.400]  he didn't defame those parents because he did and he caused them grave damage but as a cultural uh
[39:25.280 --> 39:33.280]  pathogen fox news is far more powerful far more devious far more pernicious and has created
[39:33.280 --> 39:41.040]  far more damage than alex jones ever will and at least alex jones gives you supplements to
[39:41.040 --> 39:45.360]  help offset the damage i mean that's the that's the beautiful part about what he does now a fox
[39:45.360 --> 39:50.080]  would give you supplements perhaps that would be uh but do you understand what i'm saying they are
[39:50.080 --> 39:57.840]  there is no way alex jones is is a wolf in wolf's clothing fox news is the opposite
[40:00.960 --> 40:07.200]  hey uh john stewart two judges found me guilty because they didn't have any evidence of what
[40:07.200 --> 40:12.240]  they were claiming that i sent people to pee on their graves i mean come on where's the clip
[40:12.240 --> 40:15.680]  where'd i do that didn't ever do it was a big debate on the internet about whether it happened
[40:15.680 --> 40:24.800]  or not i joined in on it gave my opinion and i was the test subject patient zero for this and
[40:24.800 --> 40:32.000]  notice john stewart just talked about the pathogen the disease of alex jones the virus the what did
[40:32.000 --> 40:41.200]  hitler call jews he called him viruses called him infections who's talking hitler talk mr stewart
[40:41.200 --> 40:48.640]  you know damn well what you're doing mr and shame on you let's play another clip here's
[40:48.640 --> 40:56.320]  john stewart talking about the right exploiting riffs here it is i'm not acting as a reasonable
[40:56.320 --> 41:03.360]  journalistic outlet isn't um a high enough uh it doesn't reach the standard you can um engage in
[41:03.360 --> 41:08.720]  sloppy journalism and not meet the actual malice standard rather you have to get to a place where
[41:08.720 --> 41:16.320]  there's this clear and convincing evidence that you had um uh knowing falsity do you think that
[41:16.320 --> 41:23.600]  this is a case of an organization a propaganda arm of a political movement knowingly exploiting
[41:23.600 --> 41:29.440]  you know in some ways it's it's they hate our freedoms and so they're going to exploit the
[41:29.440 --> 41:36.880]  cracks in a system that believes in the first amendment they're going to exploit that and leverage
[41:36.880 --> 41:45.040]  that to gain their own political power aren't they gaming a system okay that's all i don't have time
[41:45.040 --> 41:48.720]  to play the whole clip it's on info wars dot com but here's an article on info wars dot com with
[41:48.720 --> 41:52.720]  video clips there's a whole bunch of them the un saying they're already running censorship and now
[41:52.720 --> 41:58.880]  they're gonna control twitter and maybe indict elon musk for free speech un says that censoring
[41:58.880 --> 42:04.080]  disinformation and hate speech will protect free speech you just heard stewart say that
[42:04.080 --> 42:10.960]  he's going to decide what you can say he's going to decide what you can do because god forbid
[42:11.760 --> 42:17.440]  you actually come listen to this show and hear what i really have to say no no no i've got to
[42:17.440 --> 42:23.760]  be silenced so they can then put in my mouth whatever words they want and you'll never know
[42:23.760 --> 42:31.520]  that i didn't really say them they're the bad guys they're the establishment they're the elite

[47:27.360 --> 47:30.960]  final segment of hour one on this friday transmission
[47:32.960 --> 47:35.840]  i'll be back sunday live four six p.m don't forget that
[47:35.840 --> 47:47.440]  all right i want to read to you a headline because i had uh michael yawn in studio is a
[47:47.440 --> 47:55.120]  really famous military man and reporter and i was telling him in studio hey uh two years
[47:55.120 --> 47:59.680]  ago they went next level banning me and facebook said 12 people are allowed to be physically attacked
[48:00.240 --> 48:05.280]  12 people you're allowed to call for violence against them which is racketeering and totally
[48:05.280 --> 48:11.760]  illegal on every front and he just couldn't believe it and i get why i couldn't believe it i couldn't
[48:11.760 --> 48:17.280]  believe when the official terms of facebook two and a half years ago said louis fair con alex jones
[48:17.280 --> 48:27.920]  paul joseph watson laura loomer bylo yanopoulos and a few others you're allowed to call for violence
[48:27.920 --> 48:31.760]  against them and said you're not allowed to say anything positive about them that was already in
[48:31.760 --> 48:37.760]  the previous rules from four years ago but when we call someone a dangerous individual you're
[48:37.760 --> 48:42.480]  allowed to call for violence against them so i thought i'd actually show you the document
[48:43.760 --> 48:48.800]  because these are the types of things that happened like i was in the bank of the hearing
[48:48.800 --> 48:55.200]  yesterday with the uh justice department they wanted to interview me and went about three hours
[48:55.200 --> 49:00.400]  and when they said you know about your cat what's the value of your cat we might want your cat
[49:02.240 --> 49:06.560]  that didn't seem real and we're trying it was an audio meeting i'm gonna try to get that audio
[49:06.560 --> 49:10.480]  because you made the point it's a public record while they were putting out all my private information
[49:13.360 --> 49:16.480]  so last night i shot a video i don't have a twitter account my wife does you know responding
[49:16.480 --> 49:20.720]  to this is kind of viral it's all over the news and they're misrepresenting oh jones transferred
[49:20.720 --> 49:26.640]  millions of his family last year just totally made up just completely made up just total life
[49:26.640 --> 49:29.840]  doesn't matter they just say it jones got all jones got all this money
[49:35.200 --> 49:41.360]  my wife and her prenup after being married five years it says in the prenup that she gets
[49:42.320 --> 49:46.480]  half the house well her lawyer noticed that we have been married almost seven years a year ago
[49:46.480 --> 49:52.320]  six years and said oh we need to file that you your co-owner of the house and they filed that
[49:52.320 --> 49:59.600]  that's the transfer it's my homestead it we're not hiding assets but that's how they make stuff up
[50:01.040 --> 50:06.800]  that's how they make it oh look jones says they want his cat but really he's hiding money it's all
[50:06.800 --> 50:11.440]  games to manipulate you this is bigger than me i'm not ever talking about myself right now i'm
[50:11.440 --> 50:16.640]  talking about all of us look at these headlines facebook posts then deletes rules allowing calls
[50:16.640 --> 50:24.480]  to violence against dangerous individuals there were a lot of articles written about it in 2019
[50:26.160 --> 50:30.880]  and there's screenshots of it here live site news others picked it up
[50:33.200 --> 50:37.120]  and it says you're allowed to call for violence against them go read it for yourself
[50:37.120 --> 50:41.600]  paul watson wrote about it summit news summit on this facebook deletes policy allowing violent
[50:41.600 --> 50:46.400]  threats against dangerous individuals they actually floated organizing violent people
[50:49.120 --> 50:52.720]  to come after us you know they'll just silence you then they try to organize people come after you
[50:52.720 --> 50:57.120]  well that sounds pretty communist or pretty Nazi but what it sounds like is flaming to
[50:57.120 --> 51:03.040]  talitarianism but that's what they do so let's let's talk about the cat you know the media
[51:03.040 --> 51:07.760]  all says oh we called jones didn't get a comment really i shot this at like eight o'clock last night
[51:07.760 --> 51:13.600]  didn't i didn't see your calls didn't hear him we can't confirm this really happened you know jones
[51:13.600 --> 51:19.360]  he makes the uh the memes are everywhere come and take it it's a gift to my five-year-old daughter
[51:19.920 --> 51:26.000]  when she was three she wanted cat i'm not a big cat person so i googled smartest cats i didn't
[51:26.000 --> 51:32.560]  want a fancy cat i didn't want to i wanted to know smartest cats or cat most like a dog and that was
[51:32.560 --> 51:40.960]  a rag doll and folks anybody that knows anything's got a rag doll oh my god i'll have rag dolls the
[51:40.960 --> 51:50.000]  rest of my life this cat is like a rocket scientist the cat without ever being trained
[51:50.000 --> 52:03.520]  pee is in the toilet oh yeah the cat fetches balls and yeah we paid two grand for the cat it is a
[52:03.520 --> 52:09.600]  fancy cat and boy worth every penny i've always been a mutt guy had cats growing up that were like
[52:09.600 --> 52:14.320]  you know tabby's and cat you know you'd there'd be some cat kittens running around under the house
[52:14.320 --> 52:19.840]  and you'd you know take some to the pound and keep one of them that was the cats my mom had growing up
[52:22.080 --> 52:27.840]  not in the same league but i'm in this meeting and and they and they say well tell us about the cat
[52:27.840 --> 52:34.320]  how fancy it is how much it's worth you know blah blah who owns the cat the cat's a gift
[52:34.320 --> 52:39.760]  my daughter but the point is it's just a mess with me i had several lawyers on the meeting
[52:39.760 --> 52:43.440]  and they're combined 50 years of practice they never heard anything like this no it's a race
[52:43.440 --> 52:49.040]  horse or something it's a member of the family they must shoot my daughter named it
[52:51.680 --> 52:55.760]  my nickname for the cat is worm because it'll just roll around its back for hours
[52:55.760 --> 53:01.200]  they look pretty warm like they're in my arms and the cat loves me i'm the favorite there's no doubt
[53:02.160 --> 53:07.920]  cat jumps my lap all the time and makes biscuits you know but he jumped out of my hands yet last
[53:07.920 --> 53:13.920]  night i was talking so loud he didn't like that but usually i can't keep the cat out of my lap
[53:13.920 --> 53:20.480]  but the point is is that that's how these people operate and i'm not saying the sandy hook families
[53:20.480 --> 53:26.320]  want my cat it was just the u.s attorney general's office justice department lawyer laughing there
[53:26.320 --> 53:31.760]  were people were giggling in the background and they just spin the whole thing ladies and gentlemen
[53:31.760 --> 53:40.560]  so that's where we are as a culture is a weaponized justice department and the
[53:40.560 --> 53:46.880]  justice department is so scared right now tucky schumer's freaking out shifts freaking out
[53:46.880 --> 53:52.560]  they're like oh my god don't look at the footage from the capital they say it's a national security
[53:52.560 --> 53:57.840]  threat and it does turn out that the justice department has erased thousands of hours so
[53:57.840 --> 54:04.480]  tucker carlson it's not being given full access i talked to lawyers involved in the case last night
[54:06.240 --> 54:09.680]  so that's a big problem we're not getting the full footage and i think it should just be
[54:10.240 --> 54:16.480]  giving out human source like wiki leaks it's the only way 41 000 remember it was 44 000 43 000
[54:16.480 --> 54:22.240]  now it's 40 41 000 thousands of hours have been taken schumer calls mccartney giving
[54:22.240 --> 54:26.880]  january six tapes to tucker carlson one of the worst security risks since 9 11
[54:29.760 --> 54:37.440]  really the security risk is only 19 of americans have confidence in biden's handling of the war
[54:37.440 --> 54:44.080]  or support the war i tell you it's about 80 on averages another poll 8 against that's 81
[54:44.080 --> 54:49.040]  percent i had a possible chinese invasion in us prepares to increase trips in taiwan
[54:49.040 --> 54:56.080]  that's a threat to all of us this is all completely out of control but it's okay meanwhile joy bayhard
[54:58.080 --> 55:01.680]  i don't have time to play the clip i don't want to hear a voice hell i've had the bad
[55:05.040 --> 55:08.640]  fate to actually be on the view in close proximity to these harpies but
[55:09.200 --> 55:14.640]  the view turns pure evil with disgusting attack on residents of east palestine saying they
[55:14.640 --> 55:20.720]  deserve it because pennsylvania voted for trump what the hell does that mean wow the cold blooded
[55:21.280 --> 55:26.400]  nastiness of all these harpies with the children in that area in surrounding areas with deadly
[55:26.400 --> 55:31.840]  doxin that'll give you really bad cancer really quickly branding down on them
[55:33.680 --> 55:38.560]  and these pro world war three pro censorship harpies think it's their fault
[55:38.560 --> 55:46.320]  town hall started the investigation and now it turns out it is a giant pedophile ring it's all
[55:46.320 --> 55:52.480]  coming out investigation have might just have covered the origins of the lb gtq pedophile ring
[55:54.560 --> 55:59.600]  getting adopted children from christian parents where it was taken by cps to be rape ganged

[01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:05.760]  jones in a muscle t and he'll be joining us as well and so that's all coming up but you know
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:11.200]  i gotta tell you something folks with all the news and you know me you listen to info wars i'm
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:16.640]  big into the news i obsess over the news i try to focus on the real things but there's a store
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:24.560]  today that really is tugging at my heartstrings and i don't think alex actually played the video did
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:31.360]  he actually play the video of the cat i want to play this video alex jones going through the legal
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:36.080]  issues and of course they tried to take a trillion dollars from him literally they asked for a trillion
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:41.840]  dollars the number ended up being billions and but it's not enough just to take all the man's money
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:47.360]  they they want to go after his pets they want to bring his pets into this as well as children's pets
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:56.080]  so this was an update yesterday from alex jones from a bankruptcy hearing where his furry little
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:04.800]  friend there his daughter's first pet is now coming into the litigation here it is okay so this is
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:11.440]  not a joke this is real and this really happened and i just got home tonight with my family
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:17.600]  so my wife's shooting this video i'm in a bankruptcy hearing personal and corporate
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:24.960]  for info wars and the justice department is involved and asked me to be ordered me to be
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:30.960]  at a hearing today and they spent probably five minutes of the meeting there was over three hours
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:38.000]  long on my cat oh this is musha my five-year-old daughter named musha this two years ago and
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.840]  they wanted to know the assets were hidden in the cat the cat was like two thousand dollars
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:48.240]  and it is a ragdoll cat and we really do love it but they were very serious about the cat and its
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:57.200]  value and they may want the cat for the sandy hook families so the deals broke you guys aren't
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:03.120]  getting the cat uh this is next level this is harassment no one's ever heard of this my lawyers
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:11.200]  never heard of this uh this is just insane and i mean what do you want my children next you want
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:16.240]  to like sacrifice my children or something so so this cat is really sweet my daughter really likes
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:21.600]  the cat uh he's a little bit tired me holding him but i mean here he is this is this is this is the
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:31.760]  terrorist right here that they want and this is the reality uh that we live here in america in 2023
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:38.080]  the justice department hearings with people laughing in the background when they say we
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:43.040]  want your cat and it was kind of like that woman on the grand jury in georgia like i wanted to put
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:48.880]  get trump under my control and they're literally like tell us about your cat you know well what's
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:54.160]  your cat's value they're trying to like stir me up or something it doesn't stir me up it makes me
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:58.400]  really upset uh for this country they're mad they don't have these billions of dollars they
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:03.520]  claimed i did just because they lied the media said i had these things it's not real and now
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:11.040]  they want my cat ladies and gentlemen the line in the sand is you cannot have the cat i'm sorry
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:16.880]  but hey you can have my first amendment and my guns and i support world government no actually
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:22.240]  you can't have that either i'll see you so there you go
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:32.160]  now this has organically taken up a life of its own and people are making graphics like that
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:39.040]  image that was just put on the screen mooshu army so i look alex didn't want to take this next level
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:46.480]  and that's that's fine this isn't even my cat but if you have a pet i mean how sick is this
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:53.040]  how sick is this yes uh are you hiding assets in that cat how much is that cat worth we may need
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:05:02.640]  to we may need to uh take that cat that is just what is wrong with you right now i'm not talking

[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:32.960]  money he has to be completely crushed what would be left in life for alex to enjoy the love of others
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:41.280]  his family a pet a little furry cat no that has to be no you don't even get that jones

[01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:00.880]  and his fluffy fluffy coat
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:06.240]  with the godzilla goblin alex jones
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:10.080]  petting his lovable cat
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:16.480]  and you're gonna go and you're gonna ask about a cat can you even imagine that
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:24.800]  can you even imagine that think about think about the strip mining of alex jones's life
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:30.960]  and all the personal aspects that they have it written down like oh look at this he got a cat
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:36.480]  look what can we do with this cat how can this cat play into the equation
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:42.960]  and you know alex jones jokingly says in the video he says what are you going to come up
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:49.760]  for my kids next and obviously that's you know that's that's sarcasm but yet there's an element
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:55.760]  of truth there it's like well what are your boundaries what are your boundaries where
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:12:01.120]  where do you draw the limit what is the line in the sand you want to make alex jones a slave for
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:09.840]  the rest of his days on the earth but that's not enough you got to bring the cat into the equation
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:16.640]  and maybe maybe jones's descendants too you know how much jones it looks like your looks like your
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:22.400]  son has a job maybe how much is your son worth maybe we call your son in here maybe we take
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:28.000]  some of his wages too maybe we garnish his payments too how about that it's like where does it end
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:37.040]  then alex jones great great grandkids like hey we got to shake them down descendants of alex jones
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:45.840]  one of them's got a cat so it's just sick and really the whole thing is just sick when you
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:53.840]  think about it and in the bigger picture you realize that what we're up against of course
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:59.200]  there was eventually going to be an alex jones of course of course eventually there was going
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:03.360]  to be the canary in the coal mine of course eventually there was going to be the test case
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:09.360]  you thought these tyrants were going to allow you to be free forever you thought the tyrants that
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:14.560]  have occupied our government you thought the tyrants going for world government the eugenicists
[01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:19.440]  the ones that like to do satan worship at their award ceremonies you thought they were just going
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:27.280]  to let you live free and prosperous no there was going to be an alex jones there was going to be
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:31.680]  somebody to stand up and say no and call it out and eventually that person was going to be destroyed
[01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:36.880]  because that's what tyrants do that's what authoritarians do so we're in that moment
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:44.400]  and that's pretty normal actually for history dealing with tyranny but you think about america
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:49.040]  you think about what we're supposed to stand for and you think about how much we're supposed to
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:56.800]  value free speech and you see this and it is truly insane that alex jones the best way to
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:04.080]  put it into perspective alex jones is the bad man from sandy hook not the person that actually
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:10.240]  pulled the trigger and killed those poor kids not the person actually responsible for the grief
[01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:19.600]  not the psychotic killer that actually pulled it off no a man that was hundreds of miles away in austin
[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:28.480]  texas speculating on major stories and mainstream news narratives because we know we get lied to
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:32.080]  and we know there's an agenda to take the guns there always is when tyranny exists
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:41.120]  to take your right self-defense to take your right to bear arms and then he becomes the bad guy
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:49.440]  but you know he's tried to remain calm and just take take the beating that he knows he's destined

[01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:35.920]  trained under alex jones and under the info war team i really do credit that as to why i'm able to
[01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:41.760]  you know get these types of clips because alex's whole mentality was you know go where the story is
[01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:47.040]  go where the mainstream media refuses to so it's not that i'm addicted to the insanity i'm just
[01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:51.760]  addicted to telling the truth and helping the american people and i really do credit alex for
[01:32:51.760 --> 01:33:02.000]  you know really instilling that within me early on in my career leading a frontal assault on the
[01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:06.000]  lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:26.880]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show and now your host olyn shroyer
[01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:34.720]  a thorn in the side of tyrants and proud to be right here with you on the alex jones show and
[01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:43.360]  joel scousen joins us now well joel we've been talking about preparedness preparing for the
[01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:48.400]  worst from different kinds of things all kinds of different disasters from emp attacks to earthquakes
[01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:58.480]  and you're somewhat of the expert when it comes to relocation and strategy in a disaster and so
[01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:08.320]  when i look at 2023 and i look at now i think maybe the realest threat of a world war or a
[01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:14.480]  nuclear war that that i've faced in my lifetime i mean 33 short years on this planet i think certainly
[01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:22.240]  for me this is uh the most tense geopolitical wartime i've ever seen and so the threat of
[01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:29.040]  thermonuclear war now perhaps not such a far-fetched thing to think about so when you see what's
[01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:35.760]  going on in ukraine between russia and the war mongering and the sabre rattling what goes through
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:41.760]  your head what are you telling friends and family and and and how do you even start that conversation
[01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:47.920]  with people that might not understand how serious this is joel scousen well it's good to be with you
[01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:53.920]  on um as i've been on with alex at least two or three times about the ukraine war i am
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:35:00.560]  continually concerned about the fact that conservatives who basically don't support the war
[01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:07.920]  erroneously think that you know russia's the good guy in this that it's trying to dismantle the
[01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:14.720]  angle globalist conspiracy that we deal with and it really isn't true it's true that russia and china
[01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:20.640]  are against our globalist but not because they intend to you know give any semblance of freedom
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:26.720]  to the world but because they want to establish their own system of new world war very tyrannical
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:32.080]  in the aftermath of what is going to become an inevitable world war three a nuclear war
[01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:38.080]  war but it won't start with ukraine and the reason i say that i've explained this in my world
[01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:43.920]  affairs brief numerous times but i'll do it one more time for your audience russia could use its
[01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:50.000]  nukes it has the largest arsenal and the largest set of missiles with up to 15 warheads each on
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:55.760]  the missiles compared to our puny 400 missiles that we took the three warheads off of and replaced
[01:35:55.760 --> 01:36:03.360]  the most single warhead so they've got about 15 000 weapons and we've got 400 but russia can't use
[01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:09.520]  them against the west because it doesn't have the conventional military that can occupy and consolidate
[01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:14.720]  the gains from such a destructive attack that would allow the west to simply rebuild and come
[01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:20.560]  back against russia see russia can't even occupy eastern ukraine let alone all of ukraine let alone
[01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:28.080]  all of europe let alone the united states so it must wait for china to be ready to do this
[01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:32.960]  preemptive nuclear strike against military targets that's not going to happen because of ukraine
[01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:39.760]  there will be another trigger event that has to involve china and that's most likely either taiwan
[01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:46.560]  or north korea it used to be north korea only because we have 27 000 us troops there and we must
[01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:52.880]  respond if north korea which is a puppet state of china attacks south korea and us troops there
[01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:59.840]  but now that the us has announced they're putting in 100 200 advisors into taiwan it also makes taiwan
[01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:06.080]  a trigger event not as big as one is north korea but a trigger event nevertheless and it may deter
[01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:12.480]  china from attacking taiwan until they're fully ready to take on the west in world war three
[01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:17.760]  which i don't expect until the latter half of this decade so while i believe that the war is
[01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:22.640]  inevitable uh oh and i don't believe that ukraine is going to be the trigger event for that war
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:28.480]  what do you make of the phenomenon that i've seen playing out and i wish it wasn't this way
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:36.400]  of the western political elite pushing russia into the arms of china to me russia is a more
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:43.360]  natural ally with the united states and in fact historically has been an enemy of russia but
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:51.600]  our political elites they become so deranged and not willing to negotiate or come to terms with a
[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:56.400]  new russia as a world leader and they've pushed them right into the arms of china what why are they
[01:37:56.400 --> 01:38:03.680]  so why are they so stupid to do that well actually it's not true or uh oh and uh the russians and
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:09.760]  chinese have been in alliance to destroy the west for decades now and i can't believe that
[01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:17.120]  conservatives don't remember all of the things that have gone on for years from 1970 through 1999
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:26.240]  the russia looks like the russians may have cut them off did we lose joel
[01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:38.000]  all right well it looks like uh he's been cut off by uh the the chinese communist okay he's
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:42.240]  back now joel you cut off right when uh now you know what guys we're gonna have to reconnect
[01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:56.400]  he's frozen again i think i think i'm back okay there it is we've got you so all right we'll have
[01:38:56.400 --> 01:39:04.800]  to uh get reconnected with joel there and uh he's talking about the situation between russia and
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:08.960]  china now i just saw that on the drudge report the header on the screen zeolinski plans to meet
[01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:14.800]  with president g now this is of course after diplomatic meetings have gone down between
[01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:21.840]  the chinese and the russians and this is actually going on this week that happened
[01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:29.600]  so this is an interesting move i don't know much more than what i'm seeing on the screen there as
[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:35.680]  this is breaking today zeolinski to visit g i wonder how that's going to go is he going to fly to
[01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:43.440]  china and do you think zeolinski will be wearing his sweatshirt which sweatshirt do you think
[01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:50.640]  zeolinski will be wearing when he meets with g or will he actually put on a suit and tie for that
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:40:00.160]  meeting or maybe he'll reach into his wardrobe and find one of those gay kink gimp leather daddy
[01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:07.280]  outfits that he's so known to dance in and rub up against other men and maybe that will be the
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:15.760]  choice outfit for zeolinski when he visits g or maybe he'll really virtue signal and try to wear
[01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:24.160]  something of a chinese style garment even though most chinese leaders just wear suits and ties
[01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:32.640]  so we shall see that but that's a desperation move but it just shows you how weak the biden
[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:39.840]  administration is that it's zeolinski that has to go to china to try to negotiate and it and it's
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:47.040]  not biden and it's not blinkin and it's not sullivan and you may remember blinkin was set to go visit
[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:56.400]  china and then the spy balloon phenomenon happened and they canceled that meeting and they've also
[01:40:56.400 --> 01:41:02.160]  canceled other such meetings since then so diplomacy between china and the united states has gone
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:10.560]  severely downhill and apparently is so bad now that zeolinski has to go to china for negotiation
[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:16.640]  and not biden or a member of the biden administration so that really shows you how far
[01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:22.720]  things have fallen that it's zeolinski who's going to go over there and beg now zeolinski said
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:32.080]  on ukrainian state run television he actually said that if if china and russia form an alliance
[01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:36.400]  and if china supplies russians with weapons that's that's world war three he said that
[01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:44.800]  like it was no big deal uh no that actually is a big deal so maybe china has saner heads and
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:49.040]  they're like yeah you know what you said you want world war three if we get into an alliance with
[01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:55.840]  russia you you want to you want to maybe talk about that i wonder how that one's going to go is g
[01:41:55.840 --> 01:42:01.120]  trying to make a power move here is is g going to try to make a power move here or is this just
[01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:10.400]  zeolinski coming with his handout and having to replace the biden team because they're so i guess
[01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:17.760]  disrespected or or ignored by china at this point as a non entity so they're going to have to send
[01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:24.640]  zeolinski all this war propaganda is failing the american people don't want this war the european
[01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:29.760]  people don't want this war most nato countries don't want this war most european countries don't
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:36.000]  want this war it's biden banging the drums it's poland banging the drums it's zeolinski banging
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:43.520]  the drums hey but biden went to ukraine cut a 500 million dollar check and flew home still hasn't
[01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:49.760]  been to ohio still hasn't been to east palestine ohio still hasn't cut them a check but uh don't
[01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:55.280]  worry zeolinski's got a check he shoved it right into his uh leather thong
[01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:05.040]  i've got some good news our high quality supplements really work and we have about an

[01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:11.680]  is because of listeners and viewers supporting us when we talk about the crew at info wars people

[01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:39.440]  they but they didn't shut his phone off yet and if you gotta if you do have a hardline phone usually
[01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:45.920]  those things can survive and so jill joins us over the phone uh jill why don't you just lay it out
[01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:50.480]  here uh you got cut off by the break while we've got you on the phone here try to pick it up where
[01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:57.120]  he left off well why don't you tell me what i last was saying because i don't know when i was cut
[01:47:57.120 --> 01:48:02.560]  off particularly well you were disagreeing with me because i i i view the world that the western
[01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:08.400]  elites have pushed russia into the arms of china when to me putin is more of a a romantic with the
[01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:12.800]  west and i think would have rather beat allied with the west and that's what i see from his speeches
[01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:18.320]  but but you were saying you think uh that's not so much the case and that now uh the china russia
[01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:23.920]  alliance is something that's that's been around for a while that that's right and in fact i covered
[01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:29.200]  this in today's world affairs brief which just came out your listeners can get a free sample
[01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:36.000]  copy by going to world affairs brief dot com and clicking on request a sample but what i outlined
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:41.680]  is several conservative commentators who have made this same point and it's very common i don't
[01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:48.240]  fault you for thinking this but remember that just like putin's speech on the 21st he's playing to the
[01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:55.280]  west as well as to his own people but you know um the communists have always been masters of
[01:48:55.280 --> 01:49:00.960]  deception and as i say when they faked their own demise the world bought into it completely mostly
[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:05.680]  because our own globals let them get away with it i mean if i could see through it and christopher
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:12.080]  story of the uk we were the only two commentators that that detailed the evidence that it was a
[01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:21.680]  phony fall but putin is the is the you know dictatorial leader of russia it's not a real
[01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:26.800]  democracy at all uh the communist party still controls all the major parties didn't play
[01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:31.600]  though they're you know even in the kremlin you hear the word you know the party says this the
[01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:37.200]  part and they're not talking the united party of of latimer putin so you believe so you still
[01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:41.840]  believe that russia is communist and putin is a communist even though they broke up the soviet
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:47.040]  union in the 90s but they didn't break it up that's the bombing they let it go well then why are they
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:54.720]  in ukraine i'll tell you why now remember before the breakup and they did this breakup to get aid
[01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:59.840]  and trade from the sort of from the west and it worked like a charm of western companies completely
[01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:05.680]  rebuilt the entire oil system in russia which made it you know one of the most oil power houses in
[01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:10.400]  the world they never could have done it on their own we gave them you know financial aid
[01:50:10.960 --> 01:50:15.680]  pallet pools of hundred dollar bills that's why the oligarchs you know had only hundred
[01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:22.000]  dollar bills to spend when they went to europe they had nothing else for tips but the point is
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:31.440]  is that um before the phony fall of the soviet union before they appeared to let it break up
[01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:37.360]  they mandated it by the way it wasn't you know that they let people be free per se they moved in
[01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:43.680]  hundreds of thousands of russians to the baltic states and they put don boss and Crimea into
[01:50:43.680 --> 01:50:48.960]  the boundaries of ukraine now these are russian speaking areas and they put them in there so that
[01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:54.880]  they could have an excuse to come and invade which is exactly what they did in ukraine so it was a
[01:50:54.880 --> 01:51:01.120]  complete lie when putin said we don't want ukraine coming into nato because we don't want
[01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:07.760]  nato on the border they already have nato on the border with with the baltics and when the nato's
[01:51:07.760 --> 01:51:15.120]  countries even declined to let georgia join nato because of concerns russian security concerns
[01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:22.400]  in 2006 russia invaded georgia anyway so you see that was an excuse that just doesn't pan out the
[01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:28.160]  point is they let go of the former soviet states but the corruption remained and the corruption
[01:51:28.160 --> 01:51:34.400]  remains in ukraine or corruption remains in hungary and remains in in poland is said in fact you
[01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:40.160]  know lecvalenza the so-called uh you know free market labor union leader was so then what's
[01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:45.040]  the answer so what's the answer for ukraine then because right now it the struggle appears
[01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:50.240]  to be either you're going to be backed by the west and you're going to have a western
[01:51:50.960 --> 01:51:55.440]  favoring president or you're going to have a russian favoring president i mean i don't see
[01:51:55.440 --> 01:51:59.040]  any other way for ukraine right now i mean what independence is ukraine going to have
[01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:07.120]  well in fact ukraine has always had a phony nationalist as a president until zolensky now
[01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:12.240]  zolensky is a corrupt individual and corruption is still rampant remember unlike world war two when
[01:52:12.240 --> 01:52:17.760]  we denazified all the nations they never decommunized any of the countries that left the soviet union
[01:52:17.760 --> 01:52:22.320]  right ukraine still had the same communist bureaucrats exacting bribes from the people and
[01:52:22.320 --> 01:52:28.480]  that's what has given rise to so many revolutions and the maydom revolution of 2014 because i told
[01:52:28.480 --> 01:52:35.760]  alex kurback then i said this was not a western coup this was a coup done by the communist president
[01:52:35.760 --> 01:52:42.960]  yanukovic or yanukovic because he was the one who ordered the berkut the riot police to stand down
[01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:48.080]  and let the protesters win now the western people couldn't have told the berkut to stand down
[01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:54.480]  even the presidential palace guards were left unattended that's as if trump rallies came on
[01:52:54.480 --> 01:52:59.440]  january 6 and the marines that abandoned the white house would we have been responsible for that no
[01:52:59.440 --> 01:53:04.800]  only the democrats could have done that so you see there's a lot that conservatives don't know
[01:53:04.800 --> 01:53:10.000]  about the details of these things that i put out in the world affairs briefly that really
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:17.200]  clouded my judgment i am for the ukraine people not living under the phony communism that pervades
[01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:22.400]  in russia but russia is not the good guy he's not the ally of the west never will be never has been
[01:53:23.200 --> 01:53:30.160]  and uh you know it's a sad deception that people buy i mean look at his speech he attacks the lbg
[01:53:30.160 --> 01:53:36.480]  and craziness of transgender in the west why does he do that because he's playing to the west he
[01:53:36.480 --> 01:53:41.920]  knows that the conservative so i'm i just i can't buy into that i'm sorry if a man tells the truth
[01:53:41.920 --> 01:53:46.480]  he tells the truth i mean if i'm gonna sit here and say oh you're just saying that to play me
[01:53:46.480 --> 01:53:50.640]  well then i i'm never gonna get anywhere if everybody telling me the truth is out to get me
[01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:56.160]  then how am i gonna get anywhere and how am i gonna trust anybody well you have to distinguish
[01:53:56.160 --> 01:54:00.800]  between those that have ulterior motives for telling the truth now he's telling the truth
[01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:06.880]  about condemning western you know pro gay and pro transgender policies but you know paragon he's
[01:54:06.880 --> 01:54:13.440]  not the paragon of his faking christianity never been a christian you don't make christians a kgb
[01:54:13.440 --> 01:54:19.920]  colonel he knows about the phony fall of the so-called he's continuing it and playing the west
[01:54:19.920 --> 01:54:25.040]  because he knows that there are conservatives out there listening to him now the globalist on
[01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:29.280]  the other i don't think so joe i gotta stop you right there because i'm i'm of this viewpoint
[01:54:29.280 --> 01:54:36.480]  that i'm not gonna people talking about communism as a threat out of russia or communism as a
[01:54:36.480 --> 01:54:41.920]  threat even out of china falls on deaf ears to me i've got communists here joe biden just signed
[01:54:41.920 --> 01:54:47.040]  our sovereignty over to the world health organization i'm dealing with communists in the west i'm not
[01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:52.720]  dealing with communists coming from russia oh absolutely i'm paying for illegal immigrants
[01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:57.360]  i'm paying for people to live in the streets what do you mean it's not communist it's not
[01:54:57.360 --> 01:55:02.800]  communist he's a globalist he's a globalist puppet and they don't care how much money he takes from
[01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:07.280]  china they don't care how much money he takes from ukraine he doesn't even care if china thinks
[01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:13.760]  they've got a handle on joe biden the pure globalist puppet and remember the globalist if you knew
[01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:18.960]  anything about history of how the globalists have fomented communism allowed to rise they brought
[01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:23.760]  china mouth they tuned to power they brought the communists to power in russia with 20 million
[01:55:23.760 --> 01:55:28.480]  dollars of gold they cut off military aid to chen ka shek to bring mouth of our they cut
[01:55:28.480 --> 01:55:34.080]  off military aid to batish to the great communist they cut out cut off military aid to samosa to
[01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:39.680]  bring communism to nika it doesn't mean they're communist you've got to understand that the globalist
[01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:45.520]  use communism to break down the social order so that they can come in with their milder form of
[01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:53.120]  waf great reset socialism but they're not communist and you've got to understand that so why do they
[01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:58.720]  why do they want this war with putin and russia so badly if they're part of the controlled opposition
[01:55:58.720 --> 01:56:05.680]  to bring in the global government all right now remember that prior to this change against russia
[01:56:06.240 --> 01:56:11.680]  the globalists have always been covering for russia and covering for china and believe me china's
[01:56:11.680 --> 01:56:16.240]  ruthless in their comment you apparently haven't listened to my interviews with alex jones about
[01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:22.080]  the danger of china etc but what i'm saying is the reason i'm the one that was threatened with
[01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:28.960]  the fact that russia is teaming up with china instead of america what did you just say i'm
[01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:35.280]  concerned that the western elites are pushing russia into the arms of the communist chinese
[01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:41.280]  instead of having a partnership with us that is my concern they're not pushing again he's always
[01:56:41.280 --> 01:56:46.480]  been an ally of china he's never been an ally the western never will be i mean where do you get this
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:52.240]  that he was in attendance and what are you talking i'm saying it's not happening because the west
[01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:59.360]  doesn't want it the west is not the west is not interested in in having a good relationship with
[01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:05.040]  russia clearly and i think that's a mistake because now they're gonna have a better relationship
[01:57:05.040 --> 01:57:11.200]  with china and now china is going to arm them in ukraine well it's not possible to ever deal with
[01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:14.880]  the deceptive government like russia and claim that they're ever going to be now and the globalists
[01:57:14.880 --> 01:57:19.840]  know that they've been covering for russia and the phony fall of the soviet union specifically
[01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:24.720]  because they've been building it they want russia and china to attack the united states someday
[01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:30.400]  it won't happen over ukraine but they have been building for this that's what pdd 60 is all about
[01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:35.680]  the president of the citizen directive 60 that tells me i agree the globalist one is at war we
[01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:40.080]  got to take a break here joel come back in the next it's a 90 second break i agree the globalist
[01:57:40.080 --> 01:57:45.680]  want us at war i'm not disagreeing with that and i'm saying they're they're making it worse right
[01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:52.400]  now by funding this war in ukraine ladies and gentlemen this book the great reset in the world
[01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:57.520]  is a historic book that documents the globals and their own words plan for our future that is a
[01:57:57.520 --> 01:58:01.760]  hellish future now you'll be always while they still allow books i guess they're starting to ban

[02:00:20.720 --> 02:00:26.240]  so they move the doomsday clock up every time there's more saber rattling
[02:00:27.760 --> 02:00:35.520]  and joe biden goes to ukraine they sign they they sound the air raid sirens just for a war
[02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:43.680]  propaganda effort and so none of this is good and that's what i think is so sad is that nobody is
[02:00:43.680 --> 02:00:48.560]  calling for peace i don't see anybody calling for peace except donald trump and i've seen
[02:00:48.560 --> 02:00:54.080]  vladimir putin at times so so joel you can continue on your point but i would just let me let me
[02:00:54.080 --> 02:01:00.320]  ask you this question where is any effort from anywhere in the world to try to have a peaceful
[02:01:00.320 --> 02:01:06.240]  resolution to this i'm really not seeing that anywhere well there is no peaceful resolution
[02:01:06.240 --> 02:01:12.320]  when you have a planned aggression that was planned 20 years ago i mean these Russians and
[02:01:12.320 --> 02:01:18.320]  a long-term you know conspiratorial planners i mean they planned the phony fall uh you know
[02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:22.480]  haven't you heard of glitzen book predicting this that they were going to fake their own demise
[02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:28.560]  i mean you've even sold that on info wars dot com and you haven't read it it's very very real well
[02:01:28.560 --> 02:01:33.920]  we don't have a one train thought here we have diverse thought here joel well no let me explain
[02:01:33.920 --> 02:01:39.200]  the bigger picture now remember and i've documented this for tens of years i've been writing the
[02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:44.720]  world affairs brief since the year 2000 and it's all in the briefs about how the globalists have
[02:01:44.720 --> 02:01:50.800]  been building russia and china venez they need one more war we've had two wars so far first world
[02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:55.040]  war tried to get us the league of nations the global government didn't work world war two got
[02:01:55.040 --> 02:02:00.080]  us to u n but no power no military power no regulatory powers and they need one more war
[02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:07.600]  to get us into their vaunted new world order and and uh it's not going to happen voluntarily the
[02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:12.240]  us is not going to go into the wf i'm not going to go into you know you own nothing and are happy
[02:02:12.240 --> 02:02:17.360]  etc so they need one more war and that's why they've been building russia and china for the war
[02:02:18.720 --> 02:02:24.240]  and knowing you know that they're coming to state their own demise you know in russia but they let
[02:02:24.240 --> 02:02:30.720]  that pass because they want to be able to give excuse giving aid and trade to russia but they
[02:02:30.720 --> 02:02:37.280]  had to switch sides before as the war got close they had to start attacking russia and then china
[02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:42.800]  later on so that they don't get blamed for having built these two enemies now they had to start
[02:02:42.800 --> 02:02:48.640]  attacking russia earlier because donald trump won the election despite their fraudulent elections
[02:02:48.640 --> 02:02:55.600]  stuff and that's why they turned early or early on russia because they wanted to blame trump for
[02:02:55.600 --> 02:03:01.520]  collusion with russia and they've continued that ever since but that means the war is getting close
[02:03:01.520 --> 02:03:09.520]  they have to you know attack russia for what it is and it really was an aggressor in there that
[02:03:09.520 --> 02:03:14.800]  doesn't mean that you know ukraine's a good guy the people don't deserve to live under that but
[02:03:14.800 --> 02:03:20.320]  that's why they signed pete in 60 many years ago there are nuclear forces who would have to absorb
[02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:25.600]  a nuclear first strike and retaliate afterwards because that's the way that you get america into
[02:03:25.600 --> 02:03:32.400]  a global government is that you get russia and china suitable provocation i think it could be
[02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:38.800]  trigger then north korea or taiwan to nuke united states military forces and then come out of their
[02:03:38.800 --> 02:03:43.200]  bunkers and say to american people now we have to join in a militarized global government to win this
[02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:49.600]  war they won't get it without that i don't think as i've explained that ukraine is that too
[02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:57.600]  perfect the purpose of the world is that this is the weak in russia to force it to join with china
[02:03:57.600 --> 02:04:03.840]  in the attack on the u.s because russia doesn't want the conventional forces to do a war by itself
[02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:12.000]  it's china's massive conventional forces combined with russia's massive nuclear forces to do this
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:16.080]  coming world war three attack and it's not going to happen imminently it's going to probably come
[02:04:16.080 --> 02:04:19.920]  to us because china isn't ready yet
[02:04:22.160 --> 02:04:26.240]  what so what is the correct foreign policy to have on ukraine because to me it should be hands
[02:04:26.240 --> 02:04:34.160]  off stop funding it stop sending weapons into it no not at all why would you let russia reconstitute
[02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:39.280]  the soviet union so are you anti-world war three or pro-war with russia i'm confused
[02:04:40.960 --> 02:04:45.440]  i'm saying it's inevitable that we're going to have war because russia and china intend to have
[02:04:45.440 --> 02:04:53.920]  always intended well gee that's okay have always intended to attack the west i mean that is primary
[02:04:53.920 --> 02:05:00.880]  101 anybody who's studied history about you know the rest of ladies and gentlemen this book the
[02:05:00.880 --> 02:05:05.760]  great reset in the war for the world is a historic book that documents the globals in their own words
[02:05:05.760 --> 02:05:11.040]  planned for our future that is a hellish future now you'll be always while they sell our books i
[02:05:11.040 --> 02:05:14.560]  guess they're starting to ban them be able to get an unsigned copy of the great reset in the war
[02:05:14.560 --> 02:05:19.680]  for the world at bookstores amazon or info or short com but you will never be able to get another
[02:05:19.680 --> 02:05:25.040]  signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out and there's about a thousand left
[02:05:25.040 --> 02:05:30.320]  of them right now so get your copy of the great reset and the war for the world a signed copy
[02:05:30.320 --> 02:05:35.120]  at info or short com and there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the
[02:05:35.120 --> 02:05:39.840]  air so you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book you'll also know that you
[02:05:39.840 --> 02:05:44.320]  help keep info words on the air i'm gonna thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book
[02:05:44.320 --> 02:05:49.360]  or unsigned copies but i want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to info or short
[02:05:49.360 --> 02:05:54.240]  com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate to the library or
[02:05:54.240 --> 02:05:58.560]  give them to the local school this is an info war i'm counting on you and thank you for your support
[02:05:58.560 --> 02:06:09.840]  from the front lines of the information war it's owin shroyer you're listening to the alex jones
[02:06:09.840 --> 02:06:16.080]  show well i believe or i'd like to believe we can stop world war three and i certainly think
[02:06:16.880 --> 02:06:23.440]  putting more arms and weapons and funding into ukraine is not stopping it but my guest with me
[02:06:23.440 --> 02:06:28.960]  for one more segment jule says it's inevitable so okay world war three is inevitable jules so i guess
[02:06:28.960 --> 02:06:34.880]  it's time for people to just get to their bunkers or what well we don't use the b word you know that
[02:06:34.880 --> 02:06:39.600]  gets tracked by the deep state but people do need fallout shelters because this war is going to happen
[02:06:39.600 --> 02:06:43.920]  why is it going to happen because russia wants it china wants it and the u.s globalists want it
[02:06:44.720 --> 02:06:50.000]  they want it because they all want to control their own version of the new world order now i'll
[02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:55.040]  tell you russia and china are in temporary alliance that russia knows that china is the big threat to
[02:06:55.040 --> 02:07:00.480]  it after they take down the west and that's why they stopped giving military technology to china
[02:07:00.480 --> 02:07:05.280]  they fear china because china has become expert in stealing u.s technology they don't need russia
[02:07:05.280 --> 02:07:10.640]  anymore and they're ahead of russia in certain regards especially about the you know the global
[02:07:10.640 --> 02:07:18.320]  navy even the u.s navy is concerned that russia that china is building us i mean china had their
[02:07:18.320 --> 02:07:24.960]  own deception of faking the type of capitalism or or moderation uh you know what they did to get
[02:07:24.960 --> 02:07:28.560]  aid in trade so they could build up their military which they never could have done
[02:07:28.560 --> 02:07:33.120]  had we not given them world trade organization status and open up our borders to trade and now
[02:07:33.120 --> 02:07:38.480]  we're totally dependent on china and we can't even sanction them without hurting ourselves
[02:07:38.480 --> 02:07:45.280]  unlikely so the global support is going to fix but there is no way to avoid this war because all
[02:07:45.280 --> 02:07:50.240]  three major conspiratorial powers want it and it's going to happen but it's not going to happen over
[02:07:50.240 --> 02:07:55.120]  ukraine and i'll tell you the goblas know what they're doing in this step now i've been against
[02:07:55.120 --> 02:08:01.680]  goblas intervention all my career but i knew that the goblas would switch sides and do the and start
[02:08:01.680 --> 02:08:07.360]  to uh attack russia and china prior to the war so they wouldn't get blamed for it and they are
[02:08:07.360 --> 02:08:13.360]  weakening russia conventionally so that it makes sure that there isn't a nuclear war until it's a
[02:08:13.360 --> 02:08:20.640]  massive strike they want the strike to take down the entire west uh u.s military and our missiles
[02:08:20.640 --> 02:08:25.440]  so that we have no choice but to to join their militarized global government i mean i know it
[02:08:25.440 --> 02:08:31.120]  may seem fantastic to you but that's what they've been planning for very for many many years doesn't
[02:08:31.120 --> 02:08:35.840]  sound fantastic to me at all i i totally understand the concept i just believe we can stop it i don't
[02:08:35.840 --> 02:08:41.840]  think america has to support this war and i think when we had donald trump in there things were a
[02:08:41.840 --> 02:08:47.520]  little better and i do think i we may disagree on this i do think putin is willing to negotiate
[02:08:47.520 --> 02:08:51.680]  i do believe putin is willing to negotiate or have better relations with the west if
[02:08:51.680 --> 02:08:56.560]  he can trust the people he's negotiating with we didn't trust joe biden nobody does i think
[02:08:56.560 --> 02:09:01.280]  he trusted donald trump enough not to invade ukraine because i think donald trump was trustworthy
[02:09:01.280 --> 02:09:05.920]  enough when he said i don't want to fund nato and i don't want nato expansion that putin trusted
[02:09:05.920 --> 02:09:12.240]  him enough to say fine we won't go further into ukraine so i just do believe there's a way to
[02:09:12.240 --> 02:09:16.480]  stop this i'd like to think there's a way to stop this but again i mean if there's not a way to stop
[02:09:16.480 --> 02:09:22.160]  it so the conjecture is pointless here it's time to just tell people to prepare right yeah that's
[02:09:22.160 --> 02:09:28.000]  right but you see your whole premise is based on denial of the issue of the phony fall of the
[02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:35.520]  soviet union and the lies and the deception of putin presenting himself as pro-western pro-christian
[02:09:35.520 --> 02:09:42.880]  uh pro sanity of the you know it's a lie i mean if you want me to go through the evidence of the
[02:09:42.880 --> 02:09:48.800]  phony fall because you obviously don't you know are aware of it it's very very real and if it's a
[02:09:48.800 --> 02:09:54.960]  phony fall that means you cannot trust russia to say what they're saying publicly because they're
[02:09:54.960 --> 02:10:02.240]  masters of deception so russia's run a gambit for two decades and the russian orthodox church
[02:10:02.240 --> 02:10:08.880]  gaining popularity and the the not embracing the western perversion of sex in the family it's all
[02:10:08.880 --> 02:10:16.240]  fake yeah it is and i'll tell you why russia is a corrupt country bribery corruption divorce
[02:10:16.240 --> 02:10:21.840]  alcoholism a rampant are you talking about the united states i was talking about russia i'm talking
[02:10:21.840 --> 02:10:27.920]  about russian don't be snide with me what i'm saying is that it i'm saying that it is corrupt
[02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:31.520]  and if you haven't lived there or talked to russians we've seen them you don't know the kind
[02:10:31.520 --> 02:10:37.520]  of corruption there now i'm not saying that that the us is not corrupt i am a great critic of what
[02:10:37.520 --> 02:10:41.840]  is happening in the idiocy of the united states but that's the purpose of the goal was to dumb
[02:10:41.840 --> 02:10:47.840]  down our morals and dumb down our judgment etc but it is the russians and that's why they're not
[02:10:47.840 --> 02:10:54.080]  promoting homosexual and transgender they want some kind of strength in that people for war purposes
[02:10:54.080 --> 02:11:00.000]  that they know is coming in the planning of it and ukraine is part of that yeah and china's doing
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:07.280]  the same thing that's right china is you know this military that they're building is not for
[02:11:07.280 --> 02:11:12.320]  defensive purposes if you think that china's gonna be our friend so look donald trump didn't know
[02:11:12.320 --> 02:11:17.840]  anything you know donald trump never got a you know doesn't any do any research and he doesn't
[02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:22.480]  know conspiracy doesn't know how to choose someone who's not deep state to be an administration
[02:11:22.480 --> 02:11:26.800]  he doesn't understand the phony call of the soviet union uh... that's why he thinks
[02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:32.720]  putin can be a friend but donald trump is uh... you know trump made plenty of anti-putin statements
[02:11:32.720 --> 02:11:37.520]  but okay if we're getting to the point of world war three being inevitable well then what good
[02:11:37.520 --> 02:11:41.440]  does funding ukraine or arming ukraine do why would we be doing that we should be girding
[02:11:41.440 --> 02:11:47.280]  ourselves for a war dot i i've explained it already to you it weakens russia conventionally
[02:11:47.280 --> 02:11:50.480]  so that they cannot but it weakens us it weakens us too
[02:11:53.200 --> 02:11:57.680]  well we are using up weapons but we're building up military weapons capacity you know as we
[02:11:57.680 --> 02:12:01.520]  speak and i covered that in last week's world affairs brief uh... and a lot of this stuff
[02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:06.560]  is uh... is happening you know under the table without public acknowledgement but weapons
[02:12:06.560 --> 02:12:12.000]  manufacturing are gearing up all over the west including in europe because they know that they're
[02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:17.680]  drawing down on weapons but they feel and if you know that you know russia's an inevitable
[02:12:17.680 --> 02:12:23.520]  enemy on the thing it does uh... it is beneficial to weaken it in terms of the conventional
[02:12:23.520 --> 02:12:29.600]  capability because remember that does force russia to wait upon china before they construct
[02:12:29.600 --> 02:12:35.280]  they have to wait for china and that gives us more time to prepare do you agree with seymour
[02:12:35.280 --> 02:12:40.080]  hirsch uh... reporting that it was the biden administration that blew up the Nord Stream
[02:12:40.080 --> 02:12:45.840]  2 pipeline absolutely except for the disinformation that biden was intimately involved into that
[02:12:45.840 --> 02:12:49.840]  they don't let biden know about secret operation he's too much of a loose cannon
[02:12:51.360 --> 02:12:54.640]  that was disinformation do you think newland was directly involved in it
[02:12:56.240 --> 02:13:01.680]  i don't know uh... you know it's very possible she's a globalist she's a very uh you know evil
[02:13:01.680 --> 02:13:07.440]  person uh... i do believe they use son of boy technology but not normal son of boys
[02:13:07.440 --> 02:13:11.920]  you have to have a specially designed son of boy that can give out digital messages with
[02:13:11.920 --> 02:13:18.160]  instead of just a frequency to ping off of so there was some problems with reporting but yes i
[02:13:18.160 --> 02:13:22.560]  said in a willow press brief months before this could only have been a u.s. operation because
[02:13:22.560 --> 02:13:28.880]  we had the technology to do that remotely now i agree that taiwan is the next piece to get moved
[02:13:28.880 --> 02:13:33.680]  in the larger geopolitical picture when do you see the situation in taiwan and the struggle between
[02:13:33.680 --> 02:13:41.360]  the west and china happening there well china has been planning in fact plan to attack taiwan as
[02:13:41.360 --> 02:13:47.680]  early as november of last year but biden destabilized that by mistakenly telling the chinese that we
[02:13:47.680 --> 02:13:51.600]  would defend the military and you know the white house corrected by the community was like a loose
[02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:57.520]  cannon no no that's not our policy to defend taiwan but it destabilized china enough that they
[02:13:57.520 --> 02:14:04.000]  delayed now we destabilized it again by putting in one hundred to two hundred advisers into taiwan
[02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:09.840]  so now we've got american troops on the line in there which means that that's a trigger event
[02:14:09.840 --> 02:14:14.800]  potentially not as big a trigger event as north korea south korea where we have twenty seven
[02:14:14.800 --> 02:14:21.120]  thousand years we must intervene if north korea is a puppet of china attacks north korea but
[02:14:21.600 --> 02:14:27.200]  we didn't necessarily have to attack if china attacked taiwan but now we may have to because
[02:14:27.200 --> 02:14:33.680]  if we put troops in there we've got blood on the line you know uh in the game and so uh that makes
[02:14:33.680 --> 02:14:39.200]  taiwan a particularly trigger event so what does that mean it means that taiwan will be spared
[02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:44.560]  probably a chinese invasion till later because china knows that if it's a trigger event for world
[02:14:44.560 --> 02:14:49.600]  war three we don't attack taiwan until we're ready for world war three and that won't happen
[02:14:49.600 --> 02:14:54.720]  until the latter half of this decade even china admits we won't be a first class military power
[02:14:54.720 --> 02:15:01.440]  until 2027 well call me a dreamer joel but i'd like to believe we can stop world war three but
[02:15:01.440 --> 02:15:07.200]  folks um you might want to get prepared in case we can't and joel uh obviously i respect you it's

[02:20:43.040 --> 02:20:51.120]  guest here on the alex joneshow owenshaw are filling in and well chris i mean it's funny
[02:20:51.840 --> 02:20:58.240]  because the video the original video that you recorded probably more than two years ago now
[02:20:58.240 --> 02:21:03.120]  i mean it's crazy to think but i think it was more than two years ago now and it still gets
[02:21:03.120 --> 02:21:08.640]  shared online right and people are like oh my gosh like oh how did he know and they might not even
[02:21:08.640 --> 02:21:15.360]  realize how old the video is uh but it's incredible just by speaking the truth how prophetic one can
[02:21:16.080 --> 02:21:22.640]  turn out to be but you knew what was going on you called it from a mile away and so
[02:21:22.640 --> 02:21:27.360]  you've been around the world now also talking about this now there's a bunch of different
[02:21:27.360 --> 02:21:31.200]  stuff to talk about i know you've got some some personal news i think you want to talk about
[02:21:31.200 --> 02:21:38.640]  with some political stuff that you're involved in but where does the attitude lie in canada right
[02:21:38.640 --> 02:21:44.720]  now what is the feeling in canada you know you guys went through a lot you had the you had the uh
[02:21:44.720 --> 02:21:51.600]  the strike you had the protest you had the farmers and you still got trudeau in there um but what's
[02:21:51.600 --> 02:21:59.840]  the attitude of canadians now a few years removed from the lockdowns and the protests are the moods
[02:21:59.840 --> 02:22:04.720]  getting better politically is there more hope what do you think what's your analysis
[02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:10.000]  well i think there's a big divide right now because even within the freedom movement there's a lot of
[02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:13.920]  people that obviously they've been fighting for three years so they really want to believe that
[02:22:13.920 --> 02:22:17.840]  everything's over that everything's okay they don't have to wear a mask anymore most mandates are
[02:22:17.840 --> 02:22:23.600]  gone they can travel so even the people within the freedom movement got complacent and that's what
[02:22:23.600 --> 02:22:26.960]  the government wanted the government wanted everybody to feel like everything was okay but
[02:22:26.960 --> 02:22:33.840]  at the same time everybody's still suffering from ptsd and the government's for for for forging ahead
[02:22:33.840 --> 02:22:39.440]  full steam with the agenda 2030 the 15 minutes the carbon allowance the digital id the digital
[02:22:39.440 --> 02:22:44.080]  currency universal basic income it's all coming and it's all coming right now and they're doing
[02:22:44.080 --> 02:22:48.400]  that on purpose because people are still in that shocked state of mind and some people are just
[02:22:48.400 --> 02:22:52.240]  paralyzed and still can't come to terms with what happened some people don't want to believe what's
[02:22:52.240 --> 02:22:57.680]  happening but now there's a majority and it's growing all around the world that are finally
[02:22:57.680 --> 02:23:03.680]  realizing what we've been trying to tell everybody from day one COVID climate change has nothing to
[02:23:03.680 --> 02:23:08.400]  do with your health and safety it's all about power and control and it's all about controlling you
[02:23:08.400 --> 02:23:13.360]  COVID was to get you used to the idea that you need to be controlled and now climate change is
[02:23:13.360 --> 02:23:19.280]  the way to control you for generations to come so in my opinion we're in a better place and we were
[02:23:19.280 --> 02:23:25.280]  obviously because we're more free but at the same time it's a scary time because it's almost like
[02:23:25.280 --> 02:23:30.240]  the calm before the storm because we know the people in the know know that they're not done with us
[02:23:30.240 --> 02:23:35.600]  in fact that was just the beginning so when you look at it like that it becomes almost overwhelming
[02:23:35.600 --> 02:23:40.160]  for a lot of people so they don't want to see it that way everybody wants to believe that we're in
[02:23:40.160 --> 02:23:44.640]  like this greener pasture and everything's behind us that's not the case and we know that and it's
[02:23:44.640 --> 02:23:48.880]  the same thing with the war going on in Ukraine they're keeping that I know you guys want to
[02:23:48.880 --> 02:23:54.320]  talk about that too so I got a lot to say about that if you want to move on to that well and you
[02:23:54.320 --> 02:23:58.480]  know I kind of want to do a compare and contrast here between the United States and Canada before
[02:23:58.480 --> 02:24:07.120]  we do get into that because the vaccines have been kind of a major awakening moment for Americans
[02:24:07.120 --> 02:24:12.720]  and this is people that maybe didn't understand what you explained with COVID and the lockdowns
[02:24:12.720 --> 02:24:18.880]  being used as a mechanism for power and control it was more of the vaccines that were forced upon
[02:24:18.880 --> 02:24:26.480]  them that not only didn't work but were actually not safe and deadly and so that's kind of big
[02:24:26.480 --> 02:24:32.400]  been a big contention point here in the United States that's kind of been a but been more awakening
[02:24:32.400 --> 02:24:36.000]  I think than maybe even COVID for a lot of people because a lot of people that went on with the
[02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:41.040]  hey this is in the best interest in the best interest of the community you know I understand
[02:24:41.040 --> 02:24:45.920]  why but then they oh this vaccine was not safe or effective I got injected with two of them and
[02:24:45.920 --> 02:24:50.880]  now I'm concerned that I might not wake up tomorrow that's been a big awakening point here in the
[02:24:50.880 --> 02:24:57.680]  United States is it a similar phenomenon in Canada I believe you're 100% correct on that and there's
[02:24:57.680 --> 02:25:02.720]  a similar effect in Canada however in Canada I believe there's a lot more deniability going
[02:25:02.720 --> 02:25:06.640]  on there's still a lot of people that are clinging to the idea that they still made the right choice
[02:25:06.640 --> 02:25:11.440]  but you won't go see them putting a new vaccine selfie on on Facebook or Instagram anytime
[02:25:12.160 --> 02:25:18.960]  so to be honest in my opinion the number one uh adverse reaction to the vaccines all around the
[02:25:18.960 --> 02:25:25.200]  world universally is vaccine regret the vast majority of people who took the vaccine know
[02:25:25.200 --> 02:25:29.200]  that they would have been better off without taking it and they know they took it for the
[02:25:29.200 --> 02:25:33.520]  wrong reasons oh I took it to travel oh I took it so I could go here oh I took it so I could work
[02:25:33.520 --> 02:25:37.760]  all those reasons all those excuses that people took because they thought it was only temporary
[02:25:37.760 --> 02:25:41.120]  they thought they could get keep their head down and get out of this well now you've altered your
[02:25:41.120 --> 02:25:45.920]  body permanently and now you've even put yourself in a situation where you're basically a ticking
[02:25:45.920 --> 02:25:49.360]  time bomb and you don't know what's going to happen so I wouldn't want to live with that stress
[02:25:49.360 --> 02:25:53.760]  every day uh so I know I know how these people are feeling right now because if I did something
[02:25:53.760 --> 02:25:58.080]  that I regretted every day from the rest of my life it would weigh on me so I think that's a
[02:25:58.080 --> 02:26:04.800]  very very powerful weapon that we have and it's a very good point that you made uh and we need to
[02:26:04.800 --> 02:26:10.480]  harness that because that gives us the ability to expand our numbers way past the freedom movement
[02:26:10.480 --> 02:26:16.240]  before we were just the fringe minority the anti-vaxxers the anti-maskers the far right extremists
[02:26:16.240 --> 02:26:22.240]  but now the same people that trusted the government trusted the science and went along with the system
[02:26:22.240 --> 02:26:26.480]  realized that the system was designed to eat them alive and realized that they were the prey of the
[02:26:26.480 --> 02:26:30.480]  entire time and realized that they can't trust the medical establishment they can't trust the
[02:26:30.480 --> 02:26:35.920]  government but they can't trust the so-called conspiracy theorists so now we have an ability
[02:26:35.920 --> 02:26:43.520]  to bring massive numbers of people into this movement and this is truly a worldwide global
[02:26:43.520 --> 02:26:50.160]  movement it transcends borders it transcends language it transcends religion freedom reigns
[02:26:50.160 --> 02:26:56.560]  supreme above all and when we all want the same thing freedom and we're all united by the same
[02:26:56.560 --> 02:27:03.840]  thing love that's the only two things we need to be victorious a hundred percent of the time well
[02:27:03.840 --> 02:27:11.600]  and you know I would say you know validation is an important thing and you know people want to
[02:27:11.600 --> 02:27:18.560]  talk about well it's not about being right or it's not about being vindicated I would say you
[02:27:18.560 --> 02:27:23.120]  know what it is actually I'm a talk show host I talk for a living I influence people I'm supposed
[02:27:23.120 --> 02:27:29.280]  to be telling you the truth vindication and being proven right is a big deal it is actually I would
[02:27:29.280 --> 02:27:34.800]  I would even argue potentially everything because I'm somebody that likes to debate and I like to
[02:27:34.800 --> 02:27:42.160]  put my worldview and my ideology up against somebody else's and if I'm not right and I'm not vindicated
[02:27:42.160 --> 02:27:47.680]  and I'm not validated well then my worldview is worthless so no us being vindicated in this sense
[02:27:47.680 --> 02:27:53.520]  is everything and when I see the New York Times coming out with a story this week that says well
[02:27:53.520 --> 02:27:59.840]  the anti-maskers were right well the anti-vaxxers was right will we learn anything well until you
[02:27:59.840 --> 02:28:07.760]  admit that we're right about everything no you won't learn anything and until they stop even
[02:28:07.760 --> 02:28:12.400]  even when they're telling everybody they're right they're still referring to you in the derogatory
[02:28:12.400 --> 02:28:19.360]  term of anti-vaxxer or anti-master so they're still literally trying to put a negative spin
[02:28:19.360 --> 02:28:25.040]  on what is really simply the truth everything you just said is basically getting down to what the
[02:28:25.040 --> 02:28:31.520]  truth is and not the so-called science that they pay for the truth is irrefutable the truth is
[02:28:31.520 --> 02:28:39.680]  evidence for instance how is it that canada nation of 38 million at 75 percent of us vaccinated
[02:28:39.680 --> 02:28:47.440]  we had the so-called pinnacle of the world global pandemic response meanwhile we had 50,000 COVID deaths
[02:28:47.440 --> 02:28:52.560]  then you look at a little country like Haiti which Donald Trump would probably refer to as a
[02:28:52.560 --> 02:29:02.480]  shithole right there we're in a bridge right now I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners

[02:34:40.800 --> 02:34:46.800]  off now chris you were getting into this at the end of the last segment how canada is you know
[02:34:46.800 --> 02:34:53.040]  trudeau awarding himself patting himself on the back he's the greatest covet dictator of all time
[02:34:53.040 --> 02:34:59.600]  but you were getting into how if you look at the data maybe not so much yes if you look at real
[02:34:59.600 --> 02:35:05.120]  world data i just compared haydie to canada haydie has 11.8 million people canada's 37
[02:35:05.760 --> 02:35:11.280]  million people we had 75 of our population vaccinated we have what they call a first world
[02:35:11.280 --> 02:35:16.720]  healthcare system and a first tier pandemic response haydie has one of the worst healthcare
[02:35:16.720 --> 02:35:22.160]  systems in the world they had virtually a 10 vaccination rate for the country but when you
[02:35:22.160 --> 02:35:29.600]  compare the covet deaths canada had 50 000 and haydie had around 900 so when you do the math
[02:35:29.600 --> 02:35:35.040]  doesn't really add up and you can look at an entire continent like africa 54 countries almost a billion
[02:35:35.040 --> 02:35:40.480]  and a half people and they had the same vaccination rate 10 yet they had less covet deaths than you
[02:35:40.480 --> 02:35:46.240]  guys in the united states with 330 million so how does it make sense answer it doesn't and that's why
[02:35:46.240 --> 02:35:51.280]  truth matters they want you to believe that truth doesn't matter unless they're telling you what
[02:35:51.280 --> 02:35:55.520]  they're telling you and the only thing that matters is their truth but there's no such thing as your
[02:35:55.520 --> 02:36:01.040]  truth my truth his truth that truth there's always only one truth and that's why we look at data
[02:36:01.040 --> 02:36:06.640]  not so-called science we look at data and all around the world all we know is the healthiest
[02:36:06.640 --> 02:36:11.120]  people in the world are the ones that never took the jabs and the unhealthiest people in the world
[02:36:11.120 --> 02:36:16.960]  are the ones that took the most jabs four and five and we also know that there's excess mortality
[02:36:16.960 --> 02:36:23.040]  all over the world as of 2021 and the only common denominator in all these countries
[02:36:23.040 --> 02:36:30.320]  was not covid it was the jab it's obvious it was the biggest public health crisis in our lifetime
[02:36:30.320 --> 02:36:35.760]  more adverse reactions for that jab than all the others worse than covid even this week yeah way
[02:36:35.760 --> 02:36:40.000]  worse than covid that's what and the fall is just beginning because you're only seeing the early
[02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:43.920]  side effects we don't know what this is going to do to people in five years ten years well and
[02:36:43.920 --> 02:36:49.760]  actually there their doctor came out yesterday i forget the show he was on i may have sent the
[02:36:49.760 --> 02:36:53.360]  clip to you guys there i'm going to cover it on the war room and they're now starting to kind of
[02:36:53.360 --> 02:36:58.960]  get some some test results back when it comes to females that have been vaccinated and what goes on
[02:36:58.960 --> 02:37:03.280]  in the in the process of having a child and everything with you know the female biology
[02:37:03.280 --> 02:37:07.440]  they claim doesn't exist no there's a female biology to have a child and and they're discussing
[02:37:07.440 --> 02:37:11.840]  the side effects from the vaccine how it how it is affecting that and there's some serious stuff
[02:37:11.840 --> 02:37:16.480]  so like you said we're still not really into the total fallout of the vaccine side effects we might
[02:37:16.480 --> 02:37:20.320]  kind of be hitting that edge of really knowing where we're going pretty soon but you know i'm
[02:37:20.320 --> 02:37:24.960]  sure you may be noticing this too i know you spend a lot of time in the gym i spend a lot
[02:37:24.960 --> 02:37:30.960]  of time in the gym as well and what we've seen is athletes seeming to have the worst side effects
[02:37:30.960 --> 02:37:36.560]  from this so many of them dropping dead football players basketball players young players and i've
[02:37:36.560 --> 02:37:42.400]  actually seen a couple of instances at at the gym where i go with other regulars who i'll talk to
[02:37:42.400 --> 02:37:47.520]  we'll play basketball or lift weights and they've all i've had like six seven guys talk to me about
[02:37:47.520 --> 02:37:51.760]  vaccine side effects a couple of them are now they can't even work out because they're having
[02:37:51.760 --> 02:37:57.840]  heart problems have you heard about any of this even firsthand come on i have my numbers public
[02:37:57.840 --> 02:38:02.960]  all i get are people messaging me every day with their vaccine reactions so i know so many people
[02:38:02.960 --> 02:38:08.960]  young people with younger than me great shape myocarditis pericarditis blood clots shortness
[02:38:08.960 --> 02:38:16.160]  of breath uh seizures paralysis on certain parts of their body i've heard it all i've heard horror
[02:38:16.160 --> 02:38:22.160]  stories about families being relocated by vaccine manufacturers after people close to them have been
[02:38:22.160 --> 02:38:26.720]  killed i've heard horror stories of people getting uh becoming infertile from the vaccine
[02:38:26.720 --> 02:38:30.560]  and then being offered so-called clinical trials to try to get their fertility back
[02:38:30.560 --> 02:38:36.960]  back every single possible side effect you can imagine is being manifested as being manifested
[02:38:36.960 --> 02:38:42.000]  by these vaccines because what it does is it basically manifests every individual's genetic
[02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:46.320]  weakness so if you're going to get cancer when you're 70 now you're going to get it a lot sooner
[02:38:46.320 --> 02:38:49.440]  if you're going to have liver failure now it's going to happen you're going to have a heart
[02:38:49.440 --> 02:38:53.360]  attack it might just happen tomorrow and worse and like you said you're seeing it in people
[02:38:53.360 --> 02:38:57.920]  that are utilizing their athletics more than normal and we're even seeing it in hollywood how
[02:38:57.920 --> 02:39:02.640]  many hollywood actors now can no longer act because they have brain damage of some sort
[02:39:02.640 --> 02:39:06.560]  that they pretend like they didn't have anything to do with the jabs that they were forced to take
[02:39:06.560 --> 02:39:12.240]  it's ridiculous it's a and everybody's like you said the vast majority of americans know
[02:39:12.240 --> 02:39:18.320]  and americans above anyone else in the world when they find out someone screwed them over
[02:39:18.960 --> 02:39:23.920]  there's going to be hell to pay so i'm waiting for phase three of united non-compliance to kick in
[02:39:23.920 --> 02:39:29.600]  and that's when we can hold these people accountable and that's why i took the advantage of when john
[02:39:29.600 --> 02:39:35.680]  torrey got ken in geronimo he was our mayor uh to throw my hand into the ring for mayor because i
[02:39:35.680 --> 02:39:41.600]  have a massive amount of support let's break that right now i would introduce this this is great news
[02:39:41.600 --> 02:39:47.840]  and folks this is this is where the rubber meets the road it's everyday people taking action getting
[02:39:47.840 --> 02:39:53.280]  into the arena getting into the battlefield this is what the globalists really hate and so christ
[02:39:53.280 --> 02:39:59.200]  this is this is just such a great move from you we salute you we give you godspeed tell people the
[02:39:59.200 --> 02:40:05.920]  news so uh it just so happened it fell in my lap i was on my way to toronto for the worldwide rally
[02:40:05.920 --> 02:40:10.240]  for february 18th three days before i went to toronto people started calling me saying are you
[02:40:10.240 --> 02:40:13.360]  running for mayor i said what are you talking about they said well john torrey was forced to
[02:40:13.360 --> 02:40:18.720]  resign and apparently you're trending for mayor of toronto so i made a video joking about it and it
[02:40:18.720 --> 02:40:24.960]  got really went viral and i got a crazy amount of support and everybody and their uncle was trying
[02:40:24.960 --> 02:40:29.120]  to tell me to run and when i got into toronto the kicker for me was when i was in the hospital and
[02:40:29.120 --> 02:40:33.920]  this little girl asked me to run and i just thought about all the times were on video i told people
[02:40:33.920 --> 02:40:38.400]  that i would do everything in my power to protect especially the children from this globalist agenda
[02:40:38.400 --> 02:40:42.640]  that i know is designed to hurt and destroy them and i saw it firsthand what it did to this little
[02:40:42.640 --> 02:40:51.040]  girl who's 15 years old so at that point i decided if i can inject myself into a position where i'm
[02:40:51.040 --> 02:40:56.480]  directly between the nwo and the people they are trying to hurt that's where i want to be
[02:40:56.480 --> 02:41:00.560]  i want to be there to fight for the people i want to be there to protect the people i believe i've
[02:41:00.560 --> 02:41:05.120]  been doing it unofficially for the last three years not even just in canada but virtually all
[02:41:05.120 --> 02:41:11.680]  around the world i've i've put my skin in the game i've been arrested 25 times i've faced over 60
[02:41:11.680 --> 02:41:16.000]  charges i still have no criminal record by the way which goes to show you what all these charges
[02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:22.480]  are motivated by and now that i am i i'm going to be an official candidate for mayor as the mayor
[02:41:22.480 --> 02:41:27.760]  in toronto which is the crown jewel of the world economic forum agenda toronto and the
[02:41:27.760 --> 02:41:34.320]  greater toronto area comprises 10 million people of canada's 37 million and they're pushing their
[02:41:34.320 --> 02:41:40.080]  agenda hardest there than anywhere else and as mayor i can stop things like the 15 minute cities
[02:41:40.080 --> 02:41:45.360]  i can stop things like personal carbon allowance digital id i could read i could remake the
[02:41:45.360 --> 02:41:50.240]  relationship between the police and the public that has been destroyed especially in the last
[02:41:50.240 --> 02:41:56.960]  three years i can make the city a safer happier place for everyone to live and when we do that
[02:41:56.960 --> 02:42:02.160]  and we set that example and we show people that individual rights individual freedoms
[02:42:02.160 --> 02:42:07.200]  still matter that will reverberate around the rest of canada and i'm hoping it'll reverberate
[02:42:07.200 --> 02:42:11.680]  south to you guys and you guys will finally stand up because you guys have all the money you guys
[02:42:11.680 --> 02:42:16.960]  have all the guns you guys have all the power the largest citizen standing army in the world
[02:42:16.960 --> 02:42:22.560]  and i feel like canada's been leaving the way of this fight well let's talk about that on the other
[02:42:22.560 --> 02:42:28.560]  side because there's i think there's two phenomenons that we need to highlight when it comes to this
[02:42:28.560 --> 02:42:34.320]  and that's that now is the time to stand up to tyranny folks when it's easy now's the time to
[02:42:34.320 --> 02:42:41.440]  do it when it's easy but then also well okay what do i do well just like what chris said hey maybe
[02:42:41.440 --> 02:42:45.360]  doing a talk show is not for everybody maybe running for office is it for everybody but
[02:42:45.360 --> 02:42:50.720]  there's something out there you can become a thorn in the global aside you can become a stick
[02:42:50.720 --> 02:42:55.360]  in the cogs of the new world order we'll talk about that on the other side with chris guy
[02:42:55.360 --> 02:43:05.200]  right now i'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to info or store.com

[02:48:02.960 --> 02:48:08.240]  it's hard we've been we have been prosperous in the west we have for the most part been free
[02:48:08.240 --> 02:48:15.200]  in the west and maybe so free and prosperous we've taken it for granted even but now is the time
[02:48:15.200 --> 02:48:19.760]  to take action now is the time to make your voice heard now is your time to stand against
[02:48:19.760 --> 02:48:25.200]  tyranny and global government because it's not going to be so easy for long and you may notice
[02:48:25.200 --> 02:48:30.800]  folks as chris said he's been arrested dozens of times i've been arrested here as well so
[02:48:30.800 --> 02:48:35.680]  we're starting to enter the fold of okay maybe there is a risk to speaking your mind maybe
[02:48:35.680 --> 02:48:39.840]  there is kind of a risk to going out and protest but right now it might be a night in jail right
[02:48:39.840 --> 02:48:45.280]  now it might be a slap on the wrist or a fine soon it'll be it'll cost you a limb it'll cost you
[02:48:45.280 --> 02:48:50.880]  your life so now is the time you stand against tyranny not until you're completely under it
[02:48:50.880 --> 02:48:55.360]  because then it won't be so easy chris i think people are starting to get this and they're starting
[02:48:55.360 --> 02:49:00.640]  to take action agree people need to use me as an example because for me it wasn't just a few nights
[02:49:00.640 --> 02:49:08.000]  in jail i had my license taken away i haven't been able to drive since may 2021 they even took my
[02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:12.000]  gun license and all my legally owned firearms somebody who's never committed a crime in their
[02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:17.600]  life i'm still banned from flying on the majority of canadian airlines i even made a video the other
[02:49:17.600 --> 02:49:22.960]  day of me trying to book an online flight and as soon as my name is put in it gives you an error
[02:49:22.960 --> 02:49:28.720]  so if you think that they're only planning on doing this kind of thing to me no i'm the example
[02:49:28.720 --> 02:49:34.080]  because they're showing you what they plan to do to you if you step out of line and if we let them
[02:49:34.080 --> 02:49:38.640]  do that to me and we let them do that to a few other people that's going to become the the literal
[02:49:38.640 --> 02:49:43.360]  new normal and that's what they want they want to take away your individual rights and freedoms
[02:49:43.360 --> 02:49:48.720]  they want to remake the power structure to the point where americans love being independent
[02:49:48.720 --> 02:49:53.280]  and americans love the idea that their government works for them because that's how it's supposed
[02:49:53.280 --> 02:49:59.920]  to be under their new world order under their climate change their 15 minute city their carbon
[02:49:59.920 --> 02:50:07.040]  allowance their digital id that all changes you now become dependent on the government the government
[02:50:07.040 --> 02:50:12.880]  is now involved in every single decision in your life and the government no longer serves you
[02:50:12.880 --> 02:50:17.120]  the government rules you oh that's me getting arrested that was the first covid flight never
[02:50:17.120 --> 02:50:26.000]  handed out in canada by the way well i'll tell you what you certainly take tyranny with a smile
[02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:31.920]  a million dollar smile at that well that's what you gotta do because the whole their whole their
[02:50:31.920 --> 02:50:36.480]  whole thing is to try to keep you in a negative state of mind because everything that's going on
[02:50:36.480 --> 02:50:43.040]  has to be has to take you to volunteer they're not literally forcing you down and putting that vaccine
[02:50:43.040 --> 02:50:48.400]  in you or strapping the mask on your face for the vast most part they're just putting some type of
[02:50:48.400 --> 02:50:54.400]  pressure on you mostly psychologically to make you comply and if you go along with it they're
[02:50:54.400 --> 02:50:58.320]  just going to do more that's what we try to tell people everybody thought they could get through
[02:50:58.320 --> 02:51:02.400]  covid because it's only temporary so just go along with it keep your head down and we're
[02:51:02.400 --> 02:51:07.200]  gonna come out of this eventually but then they slowly realize that when they complied with step
[02:51:07.200 --> 02:51:11.680]  one it went to step two and then step three and then all of a sudden they're at step nine and they're
[02:51:11.680 --> 02:51:17.840]  in full out tyranny and that's how tyranny works it goes one step at a time and they're using every
[02:51:17.840 --> 02:51:22.880]  single trick in the book and i believe the and we do got to talk about the war in uh russia because
[02:51:22.880 --> 02:51:27.680]  it is the anniversary and i believe that's their ace in the hole and they have they're using that for
[02:51:27.680 --> 02:51:33.600]  a lot of different reasons first of all it's their catchall for the the rampant inflation on every
[02:51:33.600 --> 02:51:38.240]  single thing associated with cost of living in reality they're trying to push herself towards
[02:51:38.240 --> 02:51:43.040]  a universal basic income and a digital id so naturally they want everything we use every
[02:51:43.040 --> 02:51:48.000]  month to get more expensive so now russia and the war is the excuse for that it's also very
[02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:53.920]  convenient for them to launder money and it's also their ace in the hole that when we do rise up
[02:51:53.920 --> 02:51:58.800]  and we do stop all their globalist agenda because they know that that's the most likely thing to
[02:51:58.800 --> 02:52:04.000]  happen and actually it's inevitable all they need to do to distract us is ramp up the war in russia
[02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:08.000]  and canada is going to be complacent in that canada they're already setting it up because
[02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:14.000]  they already want christia freeland who's our deputy prime minister who's a ukrainian to become
[02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:19.120]  the next secretary general of nato and not only is she an ukrainian when she was in school in the
[02:52:19.120 --> 02:52:25.120]  ukrain she was actually being investigated by the russian kgb for as an intelligence operative
[02:52:25.120 --> 02:52:31.280]  and her grandfather was one of the main editors for the main nazi publication out of vienna
[02:52:31.280 --> 02:52:38.080]  austria at the time so she's very well connected generationally to tyranny back in the day and
[02:52:38.080 --> 02:52:42.480]  they want to make her the next secretary general of nato if you look that up and that would put
[02:52:42.480 --> 02:52:46.800]  her in a position to try to make ukraine the next nato member and that's all it would take
[02:52:46.800 --> 02:52:51.760]  well this is so key that you're saying this right now because the current the current secretary
[02:52:51.760 --> 02:52:57.840]  general um solzhenberg i always butcher his name he's been very hesitant to get involved in this
[02:52:57.840 --> 02:53:03.600]  war the pressure he gets from biden and poland is pretty much the only pressure keeping him from
[02:53:03.600 --> 02:53:08.720]  even saying some of the stuff against russia but if you look at the general approach and body of
[02:53:08.720 --> 02:53:16.240]  work in the last year really the secretary general's not been all in the war against russia and neither
[02:53:16.240 --> 02:53:21.120]  had the majority of nato countries this is propaganda coming from western media hundred
[02:53:21.120 --> 02:53:25.920]  percent and that's why they want to replace her with uh replace him with her because she's a hundred
[02:53:25.920 --> 02:53:31.760]  percent crony for ukraine for this whole money laundering and everything else agenda and if she
[02:53:31.760 --> 02:53:37.920]  becomes the head secretary general of ukraine you can or of nato you can bet that nato will request
[02:53:37.920 --> 02:53:43.680]  or ukraine will request nato membership and that's all it would take to really expand that war and
[02:53:43.680 --> 02:53:47.840]  create a world war three like situation and canada is doing everything they can to stoke the flames
[02:53:47.840 --> 02:53:52.800]  of that war while on the sidelines saying that we're trying to help out in fact i have personal
[02:53:52.800 --> 02:53:59.920]  accounts of soldiers being dispatched air force from canada to latvia which is the staging ground
[02:53:59.920 --> 02:54:06.560]  to go either into poland or ukraine directly so why are canadian forces going into latvia under
[02:54:06.560 --> 02:54:11.120]  the guise of training ukrainian soldiers but we already know we're giving them money we already
[02:54:11.120 --> 02:54:15.760]  know we're giving them weapons and now we're giving them soldiers so we're basically drawing them into
[02:54:15.760 --> 02:54:21.040]  this as nato members and we're basically setting up the states to try to make ukraine a nato member
[02:54:21.040 --> 02:54:25.840]  so they can expand this war with russia china and everyone else and that's their backup plan
[02:54:25.840 --> 02:54:29.920]  for when shit hits the fan and all the people decide we're not going to go along with their
[02:54:29.920 --> 02:54:34.240]  15 minute city and everything else they're going to use the war as a distraction and until then it's
[02:54:34.240 --> 02:54:40.080]  just a very convenient way to launder money take all the money out of specific countries
[02:54:40.080 --> 02:54:45.440]  to this day over a hundred billion dollars has been given to ukraine i'm going to give people a
[02:54:45.440 --> 02:54:52.320]  little bit of a lesson here ukraine's entire national gdp is around 60 billion so that's
[02:54:52.320 --> 02:54:59.520]  almost two years worth of their gross domestic product given away to them in a year their national
[02:54:59.520 --> 02:55:06.560]  debt is around a hundred billion so instead of waging this ridiculous war with russia if they
[02:55:06.560 --> 02:55:12.960]  had come to terms with russia and the world had given ukraine this over a hundred billion dollars
[02:55:12.960 --> 02:55:19.760]  they could have paid off their entire national deficit to zero dollars and still had billions
[02:55:19.760 --> 02:55:26.640]  and billions of dollars to invest into infrastructure and other projects for the country ukraine would
[02:55:26.640 --> 02:55:31.600]  become literally like the jewel of europe and it would have one of the highest standards of living
[02:55:31.600 --> 02:55:35.920]  in the world oh my gosh it's so absurd these people that don't understand the geopolitics like you
[02:55:35.920 --> 02:55:40.480]  obviously do it's so absurd that people don't understand and part of the process is maybe for
[02:55:40.480 --> 02:55:46.640]  selfish reasons putin wants to you know be able to work with ukraine and take advantage of their
[02:55:46.640 --> 02:55:52.320]  situation geopolitically and the resources they have no doubt but also it's like if you're ukraine
[02:55:52.320 --> 02:55:56.960]  it's a no-brainer what are you going to be the what are you going to be the lapdog of joe biden
[02:55:56.960 --> 02:56:00.560]  for the rest of your life what are you going to be the lapdog of the cia for the rest of your life
[02:56:00.560 --> 02:56:05.680]  with a little twink up there a controlled president running your country or do you want to be independent
[02:56:05.680 --> 02:56:11.520]  work with russia and and probably be a lot do a lot better for yourself and that's exactly what's
[02:56:11.520 --> 02:56:16.960]  going on it's everything that's going on in ukraine is amazing for zelensky he's becoming one of the
[02:56:16.960 --> 02:56:22.080]  richest men in the world but for the average ukrainian it's absolutely horrible and they're
[02:56:22.080 --> 02:56:27.600]  exploiting that crisis to actually further their agendas in other countries because every country
[02:56:27.600 --> 02:56:31.680]  that they're attacking to put their 15 minutes city carbon allowance the digital id they're
[02:56:31.680 --> 02:56:36.560]  figuring out the weakness of that country and they're using this war and other things to make
[02:56:36.560 --> 02:56:42.000]  that country weaker this and not just with the obvious ways like the rising total cost of living
[02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:48.960]  across the board but in places like ireland where 750 000 of the five million irish citizens
[02:56:48.960 --> 02:56:55.760]  already live abroad they've caused that refugee crisis where they brought in over 50 000 so called
[02:56:55.760 --> 02:57:01.440]  ukrainian refugees into ireland costing tens of billions of dollars and causing a massive housing
[02:57:01.440 --> 02:57:06.240]  crisis in ireland and that's just one of the ways they're working to destroy the national identity
[02:57:06.240 --> 02:57:11.760]  of ireland so they can usher in all these new globalist agenda 2030 things so this little
[02:57:11.760 --> 02:57:18.080]  farkas going on in ukraine and russia is imperative to their agenda because it feeds so many of their
[02:57:18.080 --> 02:57:23.920]  things we also know that ukraine was originally getting bombed by russia because they had us
[02:57:23.920 --> 02:57:30.000]  bio labs pentagon bio labs of course the us denied this and said russia is lying then china said it
[02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:34.560]  and they said oh well you can't believe china well now the US government has admitted it victoria
[02:57:34.560 --> 02:57:38.880]  newland has admitted it and there's a website that admits there's 46 of them now this is all
[02:57:38.880 --> 02:57:43.040]  important stuff with chris chris do five more minutes with me because i want to talk about the

[03:00:05.120 --> 03:00:10.560]  ladies and gentlemen i have a very important message that you should have been taught properly
[03:00:10.560 --> 03:00:16.320]  in school you probably weren't you should have been taught to appreciate and understand by your
[03:00:16.320 --> 03:00:25.040]  forebears and you may not have been and i want to explain why the concept of the united states of
[03:00:25.040 --> 03:00:32.720]  america is so important and the victory in the revolutionary war was so game changing for every
[03:00:32.720 --> 03:00:39.760]  human being on the planet you see leading up to the revolutionary war it was always a system of
[03:00:40.640 --> 03:00:48.560]  monarchs and kings and queens and caste systems where the average citizen was a subordinate or an
[03:00:48.560 --> 03:00:54.720]  underclassman or a slave and what we did here in the revolutionary war was we changed that
[03:00:55.360 --> 03:01:01.040]  and we changed that for human history and we continued to change that and continued to set
[03:01:01.040 --> 03:01:07.200]  the standard all the way even through the civil war and we can still be that standard bearer to
[03:01:07.200 --> 03:01:14.480]  this day but here's how you need to interpret this when you see chris sky going out there and
[03:01:14.480 --> 03:01:20.320]  standing up to tyranny that's how a king behaves because chris sky is a king when you see savannah
[03:01:20.320 --> 03:01:25.920]  hernandez go out and stand up to pete booty judge and the biden officials in east palestine that's
[03:01:25.920 --> 03:01:32.800]  because savannah hernandez is a queen you my fellow americans you my fellow north americans
[03:01:32.800 --> 03:01:38.080]  my canadians my people of this planet that year to be free and prosperous you are a king that is
[03:01:38.080 --> 03:01:44.960]  your birthright when you are born free you are a king and it's time we start acting like the kings
[03:01:44.960 --> 03:01:50.560]  and the queens that we are and it's not about a crown on your head it's not about a fancy watch
[03:01:50.560 --> 03:01:55.680]  on your wrist or a necklace around your neck or the status of your bank account or the size of your
[03:01:55.680 --> 03:02:00.800]  house it's about what's in your heart and it's about what's in your soul and it's about taking that
[03:02:00.800 --> 03:02:07.520]  attitude right to a tyrant and saying you will not take my kingdom from me and so i'm calling on
[03:02:07.520 --> 03:02:13.920]  all my fellow americans right now it's time for us to start acting like the kings and the queens
[03:02:13.920 --> 03:02:18.960]  that we are and chris you understand that mindset and you've been the embodiment of that and now
[03:02:18.960 --> 03:02:25.200]  it's time for you to have your moment as the mayor of on of a toronto we hope but i want you to respond
[03:02:25.200 --> 03:02:30.800]  to this this is what americans this is what north americans need to take back from the establishment
[03:02:30.800 --> 03:02:37.200]  your mentality your spirit your soul well i can't have a very unique perspective on this and you
[03:02:37.200 --> 03:02:42.080]  actually hit a nerve you almost made me cry right there because my wife is an american citizen and
[03:02:42.080 --> 03:02:50.720]  you guys have a constitution that protects your rights lets you speak lets you be armed lets you
[03:02:50.720 --> 03:02:59.600]  protect your family and friends and country and shrine in a document if i had that here in canada
[03:03:00.160 --> 03:03:07.760]  the feeling of pride that i would have in my country and that this drive to preserve that and
[03:03:07.760 --> 03:03:13.360]  the drive to fight for freedom would be something i wouldn't even be able to measure because i already
[03:03:13.360 --> 03:03:18.880]  feel that way and i'm up here in canada and we have a charter of rights which is basically the
[03:03:18.880 --> 03:03:24.240]  government saying you have privileges when we say you have them and we can take them away when you
[03:03:24.240 --> 03:03:30.960]  don't have them so it's even harder for a canadian to stand up to the system because we don't have
[03:03:30.960 --> 03:03:37.120]  the same protections that you guys do and the average american simply takes that for granted
[03:03:37.840 --> 03:03:45.680]  all day every day and they need to start realizing how lucky they are and how unique they are in the
[03:03:45.680 --> 03:03:51.840]  world and stop believing in the propaganda that tells you that you're not special you are the most
[03:03:51.840 --> 03:03:59.280]  special people that have ever existed on planet earth you have powers that don't exist anywhere
[03:03:59.280 --> 03:04:05.120]  else and have never existed anywhere else and they're trying to make you feel like you're worthless
[03:04:05.120 --> 03:04:10.000]  and they're trying to make you feel like you're helpless and it's taking a guy like me in a
[03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:18.400]  little tiny country to stand up against the system with nothing no money no backing and try to show
[03:04:18.400 --> 03:04:26.160]  you how powerful you really are and if it takes me to run for office to be able to unite the
[03:04:26.160 --> 03:04:32.240]  freedom movement unite the people not just in canada and around the world while happily make
[03:04:32.240 --> 03:04:38.320]  that sacrifice and i will make myself reachable to anybody who wants to help this cause because
[03:04:38.320 --> 03:04:44.640]  i don't just intend to help toronto i don't just intend to help canada i intend to save north america
[03:04:44.640 --> 03:04:49.920]  and then i believe that we can save the world like you guys have already done once before in
[03:04:49.920 --> 03:04:55.760]  history it's tough to call upon you guys again but that's what happens i feel like i've been called
[03:04:55.760 --> 03:05:05.440]  upon and i'm answering humanity is in a fight for its very life and info wars for decades has been

[03:07:37.840 --> 03:07:43.120]  breaking news to raise it didn't get to but for now it's the great jay dyer taking us the rest
[03:07:43.120 --> 03:07:50.080]  of the way here on the alex joneshow jay take it away thanks i'm glad to be here uh so we are at
[03:07:50.080 --> 03:07:56.960]  this uh anniversary i guess you could say uh of one year of tragedy in terms of warfare in the
[03:07:56.960 --> 03:08:02.560]  ukraine and so i thought it'd be great to kind of rehearse uh how we got to where we are and what
[03:08:02.560 --> 03:08:09.200]  the dangers are here because um you know lately i've been diving really deep into the cold war
[03:08:09.920 --> 03:08:15.440]  trying to get an assessment of what was really going on um why there was this larger project
[03:08:15.440 --> 03:08:20.880]  throughout the cold war to kind of synthesize and create this third way out of the cold war
[03:08:20.880 --> 03:08:25.840]  dialectic for a future technocracy and we know that from a lot of the the writings of the elite
[03:08:25.840 --> 03:08:31.680]  which we've covered uh in the last several years some 50 or 60 of those so if we go back to
[03:08:33.120 --> 03:08:40.400]  the reason for um the 20th century's two world wars and the cold war according to
[03:08:40.400 --> 03:08:45.760]  dr carol quigley that was to exhaust the opponents of the anglo-american establishment and they
[03:08:45.760 --> 03:08:52.720]  would exhaust them through two world wars and then through a cold war and if we fast forward
[03:08:52.720 --> 03:09:01.040]  up to what happened to russia in the fall of sovietism the fall of communism this led to the
[03:09:01.040 --> 03:09:10.560]  invasion of western economic warfare and looting this is the harvard summers reuben crew that came
[03:09:10.560 --> 03:09:20.720]  in and through imf shock therapy reorganized and looted the wealth of russia so while i'm sure
[03:09:20.720 --> 03:09:27.280]  to many people's public appearances the idea was that russia was going to be freed from sovietism
[03:09:27.280 --> 03:09:32.560]  and it's true that the soviet system was a nightmare terrible system and communism is a
[03:09:32.560 --> 03:09:39.040]  nightmare terrible system absolutely 100 and it's just amazing to me i can never really talk about
[03:09:39.040 --> 03:09:43.680]  this topic without people getting mad and assuming that i'm somehow kind of defending
[03:09:43.680 --> 03:09:49.840]  communism or sovietism when all i'm really trying to point out when we look into this is that
[03:09:50.720 --> 03:09:56.080]  there's um there's a danger of taking on new masters and particularly in the realm of the
[03:09:56.080 --> 03:10:00.160]  religious world which we've been covering as we've analyzed various texts that get into the
[03:10:00.160 --> 03:10:09.920]  history of nato and the history of the vatican and both the ci and the kgb kind of vying for
[03:10:09.920 --> 03:10:15.520]  influence and power with the vatican in order to understand this we have to understand the cold war
[03:10:16.240 --> 03:10:24.400]  and getting out of the dialectical thinking of thinking that the west is necessarily good
[03:10:25.280 --> 03:10:30.960]  and the east is necessarily evil if you read brzezinski for example in his older writings all
[03:10:30.960 --> 03:10:36.560]  the way back to his nineties texts he talks about this being a mannequin dialect he says the cold
[03:10:36.560 --> 03:10:42.000]  war was a mannequin dialectic arising out of the powers in the post-world war two period
[03:10:43.600 --> 03:10:50.240]  and we might think that the west was waging a war against communism and socialism but the
[03:10:50.240 --> 03:10:57.200]  reality is that the elites of the west were not really anti marxist they were against what you
[03:10:57.200 --> 03:11:02.480]  might call classical marxism and that's because classical marxism failed to achieve its objectives
[03:11:02.480 --> 03:11:09.040]  precisely because there was no workers revolution right the workers didn't rise up we didn't see
[03:11:09.040 --> 03:11:15.520]  the proletariat overthrowing their masters and you know taking over the means of production
[03:11:16.240 --> 03:11:22.240]  but what did happen was that there was a reformed marxism that found itself a lot more amenable
[03:11:22.240 --> 03:11:30.240]  to big capital known as fabian socialism that was a lot more effective and had a lot more power and
[03:11:30.240 --> 03:11:38.960]  influence and it is in fact entities like the imf the world bank the united nations etc etc set up by
[03:11:38.960 --> 03:11:47.200]  the same roads world millner raw child roundtable groups that then were able to seize america as
[03:11:47.200 --> 03:11:54.080]  well and turn it into an engine for this same power block and they did that via backdoor deals
[03:11:54.080 --> 03:12:02.960]  backdoor intelligence operatives such as noel coward roll doll in flaming wiliam stevenson
[03:12:02.960 --> 03:12:09.440]  and others who convinced f dr and convinced people in the administration to set up private
[03:12:09.440 --> 03:12:14.160]  intelligence network the secret intelligence network known as the os s that would become the
[03:12:14.160 --> 03:12:22.240]  c a which becomes america comes america's government and the secret government wasn't really tasked with
[03:12:22.240 --> 03:12:29.520]  protecting america from invaders protecting america from foreign threats really it was
[03:12:29.520 --> 03:12:33.520]  tasked with controlling and steering america because we see that the other entity that was
[03:12:33.520 --> 03:12:39.280]  created out of this was of course the council on foreign relations and that's a policy steering
[03:12:39.280 --> 03:12:46.800]  group that sits above the government structure and it in fact hands down the policies of the
[03:12:46.800 --> 03:12:55.200]  global elite to the government as a unaccountable unelected bureaucratic structure that then controls
[03:12:55.200 --> 03:13:00.240]  government so you're electing elected officials that submit to and are handed policy by these people
[03:13:00.240 --> 03:13:05.760]  who are unelected and you look at entities in the government that really run trains the national
[03:13:05.760 --> 03:13:14.800]  security council the state department it's always cfr people always and the same cfr people go to
[03:13:14.800 --> 03:13:18.480]  the billberg group and they are also members of the trilateral commission
[03:13:20.720 --> 03:13:27.280]  and they make decisions about corporate policy globally as well as government policy globally
[03:13:27.280 --> 03:13:35.600]  because these corporations are above government they own government and until we recognize that
[03:13:35.600 --> 03:13:41.120]  until people can figure that out there's not going to be any changes i'm not saying you can't care
[03:13:41.120 --> 03:13:46.640]  about who's elected but as quickly says the president is limited right president can only
[03:13:46.640 --> 03:13:52.240]  do so much your senators your congressmen they can only do so much i mean maybe on a local
[03:13:52.240 --> 03:13:56.480]  level they can do more but we're dealing with an international elite and there's not international
[03:13:56.480 --> 03:14:02.800]  click that not only has the ability to set up global institutions that give top down global
[03:14:02.800 --> 03:14:08.240]  policy remember in the last three years what do they say now it's going to be the un and the cdc
[03:14:08.240 --> 03:14:15.440]  getting their policies directly from rockefeller foundation this last week they had the world
[03:14:15.440 --> 03:14:20.480]  government the government summit right and they had all these global elites out there pushing for
[03:14:20.480 --> 03:14:30.160]  the idea of an international health organization treaty and control grid that would enforce mandated
[03:14:30.160 --> 03:14:39.120]  stabbies because what held them up the last time was local national and state laws so they couldn't
[03:14:39.840 --> 03:14:47.440]  forcibly stabby everybody because of regulations they were saying and i put these clips on my
[03:14:47.440 --> 03:14:51.360]  twitter if you want to see them from the world government summit and so they said in the next
[03:14:51.360 --> 03:15:00.560]  pandemic we want to get rid of all that so that we can forcibly forcibly inject inoculate or
[03:15:00.560 --> 03:15:07.680]  experiment on track and trace and so while russia has within it of course a fifth column
[03:15:07.680 --> 03:15:11.760]  as russian geopolitical analysts have written about because a lot of the foundations and think
[03:15:11.760 --> 03:15:17.600]  tanks Carnegie endowment so forth michael mcfowell they were they've been in russia for a long time
[03:15:17.600 --> 03:15:24.320]  because the west took over and restructured after the collapse via the imf shock therapy
[03:15:24.320 --> 03:15:31.280]  and the harvard people then we have putin kicking out a lot of these oligarchs right late 90s early
[03:15:31.280 --> 03:15:40.560]  2000s and that led to a new struggle a new cold war this new east west battle that's that's now
[03:15:40.560 --> 03:15:47.280]  emerging as a real large threat so let's get into more of that we want to talk about heartland theory
[03:15:47.280 --> 03:15:51.840]  and the kinder all that kind of stuff to give us the background as to where we might go in this
[03:15:51.840 --> 03:15:55.440]  crisis on the alex joneshow and your guest host j dire days and also

[03:20:02.080 --> 03:20:16.480]  order it's alex jones welcome back to the outside on the go so it's j dire jason also talking about
[03:20:16.480 --> 03:20:25.760]  the uh setting for how we got into this grand chessboard situation with russia and the new
[03:20:25.760 --> 03:20:31.120]  conflicts that have arisen the last year and how it arises out of the alignments coming out of the
[03:20:31.120 --> 03:20:37.840]  cold war and we were talking about this idea of controlling the eurasian heartland this is an idea
[03:20:37.840 --> 03:20:42.560]  that comes out of the british imperial strategy of lord halford mckinder and it was the kind of
[03:20:42.560 --> 03:20:49.360]  operating system for the british empire as a sea empire seeking to control the land power you have
[03:20:49.360 --> 03:20:54.720]  the sea power and the land power the land power of course being the eurasian heartland and that's
[03:20:54.720 --> 03:21:00.960]  why of course russia and ukraine are so crucial in this strategy russia has to always be kept at
[03:21:00.960 --> 03:21:05.760]  bay always has to be pushed back that was the purpose of nato actually as a defensive strategy
[03:21:05.760 --> 03:21:10.960]  during the cold war and then became offensive after the cold war which was a violation of what
[03:21:10.960 --> 03:21:18.560]  nato was supposed to be but uh we see nato now tweeting out on its actual profile that nato is
[03:21:18.560 --> 03:21:27.920]  the marvel hero universe power as it fights against the evil russians yeah i kid you not that's actually
[03:21:27.920 --> 03:21:33.120]  on nato's twitter they're tweeting out that they are william wallis they are even though william
[03:21:33.120 --> 03:21:38.880]  wallis actually fought against the degenerate british kings but nato is saying that they're
[03:21:38.880 --> 03:21:43.600]  william wallis because they're freedom fighters what does it mean to fight for freedom what is
[03:21:43.600 --> 03:21:51.680]  free well in the in the case of this this war has now been cast as a rainbow skittles t r a n s
[03:21:51.680 --> 03:22:03.520]  war and nato fighting for the rights of t r a n s so isn't ironic that in the cold war you know we
[03:22:03.520 --> 03:22:11.200]  were told that we're being persecuted by atheist communists and if we just have neoliberalism
[03:22:11.200 --> 03:22:18.960]  we open up these other countries behind iron curtain to economic liberalism we'll have freedom
[03:22:18.960 --> 03:22:25.120]  religion can come back but what happened was in reality the largest institution in the west the
[03:22:25.120 --> 03:22:33.840]  religious institution the roman calvic church was literally being co-opted advised and utilized by
[03:22:33.840 --> 03:22:39.440]  the central intelligence agency and multiple books confirm this now uh the deeper that i go into this
[03:22:39.440 --> 03:22:45.280]  i'm really just amazed at how wide and how deep spread this is even from two conflicting views
[03:22:45.280 --> 03:22:50.000]  of the cold war you have somebody like paul williams who's a roman catholic who's very critical
[03:22:50.560 --> 03:22:55.600]  of the c a and the vatican during the cold war who admits that it was essentially a captured
[03:22:55.600 --> 03:23:03.600]  institution for the c a and then we have a cold warrior himself john coller's book that admits
[03:23:03.600 --> 03:23:11.280]  that yeah of course the uh brazinski of course kissinger of course william casey of course they
[03:23:11.280 --> 03:23:15.440]  were all working and and all the way back to william colby with gladio of course they were working
[03:23:15.440 --> 03:23:23.520]  hand in hand with the vatican funneling black ops funds through the the vatican bank to fight against
[03:23:24.720 --> 03:23:30.320]  the soviets and it sounds plausible right it sounds okay that makes sense we don't want a bunch of
[03:23:30.320 --> 03:23:37.040]  commies running everything but the danger here is that when uncle sam wins it's not really uncle
[03:23:37.040 --> 03:23:43.520]  sam that wins and it's not really communism being defeated for free market capitalism it's monopoly
[03:23:43.520 --> 03:23:55.520]  capital using fabian socialism to restructure these countries i mean is the eu does this seem to be a
[03:23:57.120 --> 03:24:01.440]  economic freedom based institution do you does the imf seem like something that's
[03:24:01.440 --> 03:24:06.400]  based around economic freedom and liberty does unesco seem like something based around
[03:24:06.400 --> 03:24:11.120]  economic freedom and liberty well if you mean by economic freedom and liberty going back to the
[03:24:11.120 --> 03:24:16.800]  british empire and social Darwinism and uh you know those kinds of things i guess it does make
[03:24:16.800 --> 03:24:23.040]  sense that would be right atomistic individualistic enlightenment libertarianism based around
[03:24:23.760 --> 03:24:30.960]  atheistic evolutionary philosophy in which case rights don't actually exist this thing is rights
[03:24:30.960 --> 03:24:36.800]  rights are just arbitrary because overall just manifestations of nature nature doesn't have
[03:24:36.800 --> 03:24:45.360]  rights do you think the predator-prey relationship has anything to do with rights no it's just brute
[03:24:45.360 --> 03:24:50.960]  power brute force and so we're presented with a situation post enlightenment of are you going to
[03:24:50.960 --> 03:24:59.760]  choose hobzian leviathan state or do you want a revolutionary anarcho state no state which always
[03:24:59.760 --> 03:25:05.360]  as played it says falls over into tyranny because when you have the rule of the many anarchy that
[03:25:05.360 --> 03:25:14.160]  falls over into despotism and oligarchy and so it's just amazing to me that people would buy
[03:25:14.160 --> 03:25:21.680]  into this this dialectic and we're supposed to have believed that nato was the good guy all these
[03:25:21.680 --> 03:25:26.320]  years and the reality is that we're talking about two different bad guys okay we're talking about
[03:25:26.320 --> 03:25:35.040]  about soviet communism hoisted upon russia and the baltic states via elites in the west
[03:25:37.920 --> 03:25:46.000]  it's not russia organically that was communist it's not the west organically that has any of these
[03:25:46.800 --> 03:25:54.640]  ideologies that are unnatural to these people groups these are created ideologies that are
[03:25:54.640 --> 03:26:03.120]  techniques and systems of control and so now that we're in this post cold war era where the
[03:26:03.120 --> 03:26:09.120]  war became an international war on terror i was watching a goofy movie the other night that illustrated
[03:26:09.120 --> 03:26:14.160]  this in a very profound way which surprised me because we've done a lot of analyses of the
[03:26:14.720 --> 03:26:20.640]  bond films and typically we think about oh well the most revelatory ones are going to be the ones
[03:26:20.640 --> 03:26:27.520]  you know from the classic in flaming period but i was watching tomorrow never dies from 1997
[03:26:28.080 --> 03:26:34.560]  and the weirdest part about that one i think that's the second to last uh or maybe it's this it's the
[03:26:34.560 --> 03:26:42.640]  second um pierce brasman bond film and if you remember this plot it's it's pretty instructive
[03:26:42.640 --> 03:26:48.240]  because you have this giant media empire the carver media group jonathan price plays the bond
[03:26:48.240 --> 03:26:56.400]  villain as a media mogul and the media mogul decides that the the world can be manipulated through
[03:26:57.280 --> 03:27:08.080]  fake news big news right and so not only does he engineer crises he also creates the narrative
[03:27:08.080 --> 03:27:15.520]  around the crises that he's engineered and the plot involves the east and the west being manipulated
[03:27:15.520 --> 03:27:23.520]  into a conflict by an international supran international group and that's always in the bond
[03:27:23.520 --> 03:27:27.040]  films right obviously there's specter this kind of thing now there's not specter in this one this
[03:27:27.040 --> 03:27:34.640]  is you know 1987 but here's the the weird part so bond ends up working together at times with russian
[03:27:35.280 --> 03:27:41.360]  soviet individuals i guess we're supposed to think it's post soviet so they're not so but they
[03:27:41.360 --> 03:27:47.600]  act like you know that now it's a soviet terror network and then bond aligns himself with a chinese
[03:27:47.600 --> 03:27:56.480]  communist spy to unfoil the plots of the international elite now that's bizarre because
[03:27:56.480 --> 03:28:01.360]  okay there are international elites that try to play these powers off against one another
[03:28:04.480 --> 03:28:10.720]  and i think that to a degree that's what's going on because i'm not saying that there's no real conflict
[03:28:10.720 --> 03:28:15.760]  there's no real war there is but i'm saying that in so many films we have an international elite
[03:28:15.760 --> 03:28:22.800]  this kind of kissinger brazinski structure clouse you know the supran international elite that plays
[03:28:22.800 --> 03:28:28.160]  the nation states off against one another and they plan and prepare for wars decades ahead of time
[03:28:29.600 --> 03:28:34.480]  and so i think yeah absolutely they wanted this war in the ukraine and they want a new cold war
[03:28:35.040 --> 03:28:40.480]  and it's part of the overall strategy to bring in the technocracy and we'll look at that here in
[03:28:40.480 --> 03:28:46.800]  a moment get into the specifics of why these kinds of countries and states stand in the way
[03:28:46.800 --> 03:28:50.880]  doesn't mean that they're perfect but they stand in the way of a certain kind of ideology
[03:28:50.880 --> 03:28:55.920]  a certain kind of worldview that has to be pushed globally this is the alksjohn show i'm your guest

[03:33:00.240 --> 03:33:16.000]  lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[03:33:16.000 --> 03:33:19.680]  welcome back to the alex jones i'm your guest host j dire jays analysis you know what's interesting
[03:33:19.680 --> 03:33:27.280]  is that um it's time of world war two when uh hitler understood the importance geostrategically
[03:33:27.280 --> 03:33:36.080]  of trying to control ukraine and to push back on russia the galen network of rinehart galen
[03:33:36.080 --> 03:33:42.800]  and other nazis had actually trained and set up a lot of the intelligence and black ops structures
[03:33:43.360 --> 03:33:49.920]  in these areas and this ties into nato's gladio operations and what's what's amazing is that
[03:33:49.920 --> 03:33:56.080]  those networks then were sort of taken over by the west we all know about operation paperclip
[03:33:56.080 --> 03:34:03.360]  but people like dullis and others bill donovan they also made alliances with these galen networks
[03:34:03.360 --> 03:34:09.760]  that are still running things still doing these operations into ukraine so it's amazing all
[03:34:09.760 --> 03:34:19.360]  the posturing in the west about being everybody who's not for total liberalism as a nazi and yet
[03:34:19.360 --> 03:34:26.800]  we're openly supporting and aiding openly take pictures with nazi battalions in the ukraine
[03:34:26.800 --> 03:34:34.560]  the real actual nazis i mean this is just absurd levels of stupidity and hypocrisy and it's just
[03:34:34.560 --> 03:34:39.200]  it's kind of amazing to me and people think that this is some kind of base red-pilled thing it's not
[03:34:39.200 --> 03:34:45.520]  it's a completely controlled and manipulated operation and it has nothing really to do with
[03:34:45.520 --> 03:34:52.160]  these ideologies other than that these are controlled groups that are controlled by western
[03:34:52.160 --> 03:34:59.760]  intelligence to engage in irregular warfare to engage in proxy warfare to destabilize and to
[03:34:59.760 --> 03:35:06.960]  restructure and destroy areas to fit them into not the american century do people understand
[03:35:06.960 --> 03:35:11.200]  that all these boomers and cold war people think we're gonna fight the communists we're gonna keep
[03:35:11.200 --> 03:35:18.560]  the kgb and russia out of ukraine no it's not the american century anymore do you understand
[03:35:18.560 --> 03:35:23.680]  that this what that was a con and maybe there could have been an american century that wasn't
[03:35:23.680 --> 03:35:29.680]  a con i don't know but all the people who came up with the idea of the american century the state
[03:35:29.680 --> 03:35:39.200]  department george kenan that was all dreamt up by the cfr and the 1939 war and peace studies project
[03:35:39.200 --> 03:35:44.800]  from the new york city council and foreign relations that's when they created right after
[03:35:44.800 --> 03:35:54.960]  that the un right right at that time and so this idea of fostering democracy fostering
[03:35:54.960 --> 03:36:00.240]  free market liberalism which is not really what it was that was for the fortune 100 fortune 500
[03:36:00.240 --> 03:36:09.840]  to go into these countries and restructure them to loot them so again does that make the the cold
[03:36:10.720 --> 03:36:20.320]  war iron curtain does that make them good no but is it possible that we have turned into a
[03:36:20.320 --> 03:36:24.400]  worse thing that's what i'm trying to posit to you and the more that i read about the stars in
[03:36:24.400 --> 03:36:30.400]  the kgb and all this stuff and how awful they were all the awful stuff that they did to people in
[03:36:30.400 --> 03:36:35.680]  these books i'm just reminded of what but aren't the global elite that run things now like ten
[03:36:35.680 --> 03:36:41.680]  times worse are they doing ten ten times worse things is it what they want to set up with every
[03:36:41.680 --> 03:36:54.960]  era of your life tracking trace a ten times worse version of all that stuff seems like a to me
[03:36:54.960 --> 03:37:01.200]  and while it's true that communism had this ridiculous idealistic system that was based
[03:37:01.200 --> 03:37:09.600]  around everyone being essentially sacrificed to the collective and to this bizarre technocratic
[03:37:09.600 --> 03:37:14.800]  atheistic system that was an older technocratic model that has caved to a new technocratic model
[03:37:15.360 --> 03:37:20.000]  if you remember the way that brzezinski and not brzezinski the way that birch and ross on hc
[03:37:20.000 --> 03:37:23.840]  wells these different these big level strategies the way they talked about communism and socialism
[03:37:23.840 --> 03:37:30.320]  marks them was as if they were experiments in other countries to see how well they functioned
[03:37:30.320 --> 03:37:36.160]  how well they worked as control mechanisms in other areas and for certain people and not every
[03:37:36.160 --> 03:37:42.640]  system works that well to control everybody equally because different regions different people groups
[03:37:43.200 --> 03:37:50.160]  require different strategies that's why the ca studies ethnography to master the local customs
[03:37:50.160 --> 03:37:54.560]  and idiosyncrasies of various peoples to best influence and control them
[03:37:54.560 --> 03:38:07.600]  and so do we understand what's going on really that that it's and it's doesn't mean that
[03:38:07.600 --> 03:38:14.640]  russia is a representation of authentic pure 100 accurate christianity there's absolutely
[03:38:15.280 --> 03:38:22.320]  corruption in eastern bloc countries there's absolutely corruption in the russian government
[03:38:22.320 --> 03:38:28.960]  sure but that's everywhere and if you listen to putin's speech what did putin say about
[03:38:30.000 --> 03:38:38.640]  what russia represents it's the representation of a system that didn't completely get destroyed
[03:38:40.160 --> 03:38:46.080]  in the post cold war period in the world war two and post cold war period in other words there's a
[03:38:46.080 --> 03:38:54.160]  representation of the maintenance of the people and their faith and their tradition and that they
[03:38:54.160 --> 03:39:06.480]  don't want enforced sadanism and even if putin is some villain or something which he just seems
[03:39:06.480 --> 03:39:12.080]  to be a pragmatic global leader like anyone else right people always ask me what do you think about
[03:39:12.080 --> 03:39:15.840]  putin what do you think about elon musk what do you think about donald trump i don't know i don't
[03:39:15.840 --> 03:39:19.520]  have any thoughts other than i like it when they do something good and if they do something bad i
[03:39:19.520 --> 03:39:28.000]  disagree so there's no pipe dreams about you know some utopia that's going to be created in some
[03:39:28.000 --> 03:39:35.600]  other country but there is the reality of western elites being completely maniacal completely out of
[03:39:35.600 --> 03:39:42.160]  touch with the reality completely i mean it's people like brzezinski and kissinger and and bill
[03:39:42.160 --> 03:39:47.760]  gates and and claus wab and george soros and i mean they brag about what they're doing they're 100
[03:39:47.760 --> 03:39:56.880]  percent into malthusianism but even the soviets weren't maniacal malthusians right and they had
[03:39:56.880 --> 03:40:01.120]  ridiculous things like lysenkoism and these stupid philosophies but and they would they
[03:40:01.120 --> 03:40:11.440]  would certainly kill and starve off uh people who oppose them but i'll really who by the way supported
[03:40:11.440 --> 03:40:15.200]  all those ideas now want something 10 times worse than that
[03:40:18.160 --> 03:40:23.920]  do you understand how crazy that is and now we're at the point where it's like oh yeah now we need
[03:40:23.920 --> 03:40:32.160]  to nuke we need to know we need to blow everything up destroy everything these lunatics like shan pen
[03:40:33.680 --> 03:40:39.200]  let's nuke everybody let's nuke these whole all of those blow everything up i mean i can't imagine
[03:40:39.200 --> 03:40:43.840]  that these people i mean it's almost as if they're completely taken over by something else something
[03:40:43.840 --> 03:40:51.840]  else is running them and they just have this innate thirst for the destruction of cities the
[03:40:51.840 --> 03:40:59.360]  destruction of countries the destruction of what they think is their enemy like the the view
[03:40:59.360 --> 03:41:05.200]  heartbeat saying that everybody everybody in the midwest deserves to be destroyed because
[03:41:07.360 --> 03:41:15.040]  that state went for trump that's crazy but we see the spirit that motivates somebody like that
[03:41:15.040 --> 03:41:26.960]  that can't be good that is a demonic spirit and so this whole cold war situation and where we're
[03:41:26.960 --> 03:41:33.920]  going is not random conflicts this is all drawn up by the rand corporation drawn up by these entities
[03:41:33.920 --> 03:41:39.600]  created out of the same network that i'm talking about the deep state and by the way it's great
[03:41:39.600 --> 03:41:46.320]  that trump called out victoria newland that's i mean that's who has been pushing this for all this
[03:41:46.320 --> 03:41:53.600]  time trying to provoke this conflict trying to provoke russia for all these years back to 2014
[03:41:53.600 --> 03:42:01.360]  and all the way back to the 80s with the color revolutions but if rand corporation was drawing
[03:42:01.360 --> 03:42:06.400]  up these strategies and these plans decades ago then how can it be the fault of countries that
[03:42:06.400 --> 03:42:13.040]  just want to preserve what they are and their way of life and ukraine is not a historic nation state
[03:42:13.680 --> 03:42:21.360]  it's part of russia so of course they want ukraine why wouldn't they when that is the heart of russia
[03:42:21.360 --> 03:42:30.240]  kev is the heart of russia and breaking it off is a western imperial strategy going all the way back
[03:42:30.240 --> 03:42:36.960]  to world war one so you have to understand that this is a bigger game that's being played and
[03:42:36.960 --> 03:42:43.200]  it doesn't mean that russia or any of these other countries is a perfect utopia it means that they're
[03:42:43.200 --> 03:42:49.520]  they represent things that stand in the way of the advance of total technocracy and total
[03:42:49.520 --> 03:42:54.400]  malthusian depopulation total destruction that's what it represents don't go anywhere this is the

[03:47:00.640 --> 03:47:04.640]  lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[03:47:13.440 --> 03:47:16.800]  welcome back to the outside show i'm your guest host j dire of jason halsis we were talking about
[03:47:17.920 --> 03:47:22.000]  what emerged out of the cold war dialectic and what the long-term plan was
[03:47:22.960 --> 03:47:27.040]  and the long-term plan is now completely evident right again i think we could give
[03:47:27.040 --> 03:47:32.720]  some leeway to people in the 50s 60s 70s you know living in the time of the cold war
[03:47:33.600 --> 03:47:37.840]  they didn't have access to the information they didn't have access to what we have access to now
[03:47:38.720 --> 03:47:42.560]  and so a lot of good people including my family members i had family members that
[03:47:43.920 --> 03:47:51.280]  fought for the west and were cold warriors that engaged in cold war activities for the
[03:47:51.280 --> 03:47:58.080]  air force for example and so you know it has nothing to do with i want to pick some side
[03:47:58.080 --> 03:48:02.960]  because i have this idealistic view that somehow there's going to be this future
[03:48:03.600 --> 03:48:07.440]  orthodox christian empire or that russia is going to save the world or something like that now
[03:48:08.880 --> 03:48:12.400]  maybe that maybe russia saves the world by and i don't know i don't know i mean these are getting
[03:48:12.400 --> 03:48:18.640]  so crazy who knows but i don't think that salvation or anything like that comes necessarily from a
[03:48:18.640 --> 03:48:25.440]  nation state per se but god can providentially use situations like this to stave off completely
[03:48:25.440 --> 03:48:32.160]  demonized structures that are openly everybody can see what's being promoted by the western elite
[03:48:32.160 --> 03:48:40.000]  now and 100 this is a global agenda they want to push this everywhere and so what's happening is
[03:48:40.000 --> 03:48:50.800]  the removal of potential areas of resistance and that's not just the ukraine conflict that also is
[03:48:50.800 --> 03:48:56.000]  domestically in the west it's anybody in the in the western countries that potentially could stand
[03:48:56.000 --> 03:49:01.760]  up to or oppose the threat and that's why there are these long-term operations to demographically
[03:49:01.760 --> 03:49:08.240]  destroy different areas and regions it's an open stated thing there's a book called weapons of mass
[03:49:08.240 --> 03:49:13.840]  migration by kelly greenhill it's a i think it's a stanford university publication i think it's
[03:49:13.840 --> 03:49:19.200]  connected to the army war college it's about warfare with population but you can't talk about
[03:49:19.200 --> 03:49:23.360]  that because it makes you a bad person even though it's a public fact that it's a real strategy of
[03:49:23.360 --> 03:49:34.400]  warfare and that's to weaken and destroy to integrate into this coming global government
[03:49:34.400 --> 03:49:41.680]  and so the danger is that now that we're reaching this coming to a head and now we have
[03:49:42.880 --> 03:49:47.600]  zolinsky and others threatening world war three if there's a union between russia and china
[03:49:48.240 --> 03:49:53.600]  again keep in mind that doesn't make any of these powers necessarily the good guys
[03:49:55.360 --> 03:50:01.440]  and my point is that as i was pointing out with the bond film tomorrow never dies there's a lot
[03:50:01.440 --> 03:50:09.440]  of other movies that have this same kind of plot going on think about x-men the one with michael
[03:50:09.440 --> 03:50:15.600]  fastbender where he's where he's magneto you have this elite group that's trying to kick off a nuclear
[03:50:15.600 --> 03:50:19.760]  exchange between the east and the west think about war games where an ai tries to kick off
[03:50:20.640 --> 03:50:26.640]  this global world war between the east and the west think about tomorrow never dies where an
[03:50:26.640 --> 03:50:31.280]  elite group is trying to cause an instantiate an act that war between the east and the west
[03:50:32.640 --> 03:50:39.360]  and so i think that there is a desire on the part of some of the more demonically energized
[03:50:39.360 --> 03:50:46.800]  elites in the west that they would be happy to see full on total war because eventually what
[03:50:46.800 --> 03:50:51.360]  happens is that these people are so given over to evil that they're not even in control of their own
[03:50:51.360 --> 03:50:58.720]  faculties anymore they lose their own reasoning faculty and they become essentially union united
[03:50:58.720 --> 03:51:08.000]  with evil powers and by doing so they're not in control they're not steering anymore they're
[03:51:08.000 --> 03:51:14.880]  steered by something else and what is it that all these people want to enact they want to enact a
[03:51:14.880 --> 03:51:22.480]  new order a new aeon a new era that is post human every one of the global elite that we've
[03:51:22.480 --> 03:51:27.280]  analyzed in terms of their books they're all 100 on the same page when it comes to this
[03:51:27.280 --> 03:51:32.320]  none of them disagree there are no pro human pro life global elites you understand that none of them
[03:51:34.240 --> 03:51:40.080]  there are none of them who disagree with a global government who disagree with a global
[03:51:40.080 --> 03:51:48.480]  single cbdc currency the bis guy the triple chin guy just came out again and said fiat has won it
[03:51:48.480 --> 03:51:54.400]  is beaten bitcoin which is laughable he says that we will have this cbdc we will have it and we'll
[03:51:54.400 --> 03:51:59.920]  shut your wallets off you will be under total control for anything that you say that's esg
[03:51:59.920 --> 03:52:14.080]  this technocratic system was designed out of rand cia world war two cold war operations
[03:52:16.080 --> 03:52:21.280]  studying all of the conflicts to figure out the best techniques and mechanisms to control
[03:52:21.280 --> 03:52:29.520]  and manage populations through tech through smart cities for example in the phoenix program book
[03:52:29.520 --> 03:52:34.880]  that we analyzed by dug valentine we learned that fema and homeland security were set up on the
[03:52:34.880 --> 03:52:40.560]  models of the phoenix program and on the models of vietnam and population reorganization studies
[03:52:41.440 --> 03:52:46.880]  we learned that in vietnam a lot of the ai and drone technology was first tested out
[03:52:47.680 --> 03:52:55.520]  in the vietnam conflict we learned that darpa and the pentagon were strategizing and testing out
[03:52:55.520 --> 03:53:01.600]  various techniques for masses of population tracking and control in vietnam and subsequent
[03:53:01.600 --> 03:53:06.160]  conflicts as well right desert storm we know that people were beginning to be biometrically
[03:53:06.160 --> 03:53:13.760]  tracked and traced even at the time of desert storm the iraq conflict and so these power structures
[03:53:13.760 --> 03:53:18.480]  are the same power structures that control the global drug trade do you think that these are
[03:53:18.480 --> 03:53:28.480]  good people they're controlling the global drug trade and the insane explosion of heroin production
[03:53:28.480 --> 03:53:42.400]  since the last 10 15 20 years look at our country being destroyed by legal heroin opioids and illegal
[03:53:42.400 --> 03:53:49.280]  opioids that bit that's because the western power structure took over all of the drug networks
[03:53:49.840 --> 03:53:58.000]  and lanes in the last 50 60 years and they did that in concert with aligning themselves with
[03:53:58.000 --> 03:54:05.120]  organized crime as multiple analysts have pointed out even from the fbi itself right fbi consultant
[03:54:05.120 --> 03:54:12.240]  paul williams cia os s they took over all of the old drug networks drug lanes and what i'm trying to
[03:54:12.240 --> 03:54:16.000]  say is that this is what it means to have full spectrum dominance to have full spectrum control
[03:54:16.000 --> 03:54:22.480]  is to control all these areas of life they're not doing it because it's just a hobby it's fun to do
[03:54:22.480 --> 03:54:27.760]  to study oh we're nerds no it's about what they are bringing in do you understand this is not this
[03:54:27.760 --> 03:54:38.240]  is a real plan it's not theories i wonder what they're gonna do i i mean they all put in their
[03:54:38.240 --> 03:54:46.640]  books what they're gonna do it's not guesswork now how they roll this out is guesswork we don't
[03:54:46.640 --> 03:54:53.440]  know what cards these people are gonna play a lot of people didn't know for sure right we didn't know
[03:54:53.440 --> 03:54:59.360]  they were gonna have this covid all this kind of stuff that rolled out but then after it happens
[03:54:59.360 --> 03:55:04.720]  we look back and we can see oh they're running all these drills for the exact same thing crimson
[03:55:04.720 --> 03:55:14.800]  contagion clade x spars document event 201 and we can see that this is a strategized rolled out plan
[03:55:16.240 --> 03:55:19.120]  it's the same with all these ran corporation documents that have been mentioning all these
[03:55:19.120 --> 03:55:25.440]  white papers that plan the future that plan and strategize a global conflict as one of the cards
[03:55:25.440 --> 03:55:31.680]  that can be played literally ran corporation strategies about a war between russia and the
[03:55:31.680 --> 03:55:37.760]  west nuclear changes right pdd 60 or whatever it is presidential decision directive under clinton of
[03:55:37.760 --> 03:55:43.120]  absorbing a nuclear strike which supposedly has been updated or whatever i i don't know all the
[03:55:43.120 --> 03:55:50.000]  the pds but the point is that you do have strategies about this and none of those strategies are made
[03:55:50.000 --> 03:56:03.360]  with your welfare in mind because the same people that run giant drug laundering banks
[03:56:04.080 --> 03:56:09.920]  like hsbc and all these other banks that got busted 10 years ago for 300 million dollars worth of
[03:56:09.920 --> 03:56:16.480]  of drug money you think that's just random bad apples no that's the people that run
[03:56:17.120 --> 03:56:22.240]  the west that's the same structure the same people that we're talking about inspector
[03:56:24.720 --> 03:56:30.240]  inspector would like to see a destructive war probably eventually
[03:56:33.280 --> 03:56:37.040]  it's definitely one of the cards that they could play i mean i hope there's not gonna
[03:56:37.040 --> 03:56:42.160]  be a world war but they could definitely play that card they have talked and strategized about it for a
[03:56:42.160 --> 03:56:49.280]  long time the possibility of a new world war now it's more likely than ever it's being talked about
[03:56:49.280 --> 03:56:56.320]  openly and if it happens it would be because the elite want that to happen to have a mass
[03:56:56.320 --> 03:57:02.800]  destruction to bring in their post-human world where we're run by ai we're run in some kind of new
[03:57:02.800 --> 03:57:11.680]  uh technocratic system where everything is tracked and traced maybe the elite emerge from
[03:57:11.680 --> 03:57:17.840]  underground bunkers after a giant exchange who knows but that's definitely one of the cards
[03:57:17.840 --> 03:57:21.440]  that get that they could play we have to keep that in mind and another pandemic is another
[03:57:21.440 --> 03:57:24.960]  card they could play they could play both cards so we have to be prepared for these things because
[03:57:24.960 --> 03:57:29.440]  there's these are realities that's the world that we live in and if we don't realize what's going on
