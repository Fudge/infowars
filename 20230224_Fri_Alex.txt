[00:00:16.563 --> 00:00:17.664]  InfoWars.
[00:00:17.664 --> 00:00:19.225]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:00:20.806 --> 00:00:26.607]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:00:26.607 --> 00:00:28.688]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:00:28.688 --> 00:00:30.828]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:30.828 --> 00:00:38.270]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.371]  It's Friday, February 24th, 2023.
[00:00:41.371 --> 00:00:45.372]  I am your battle host, Alex Jones, thanking you all.
[00:00:45.372 --> 00:00:49.333]  However, you're tuning in for joining us and reminding you, the real power are we the people.
[00:00:50.024 --> 00:00:54.466]  Is your word of mouth and your human intelligence when you take action and spread the word?
[00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:58.087]  At ConspiracyFact.info and InfoWars.com and Band.Video.
[00:00:58.087 --> 00:01:01.688]  It truly changes the world.
[00:01:01.688 --> 00:01:02.849]  All right.
[00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:06.850]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Friday edition.
[00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:13.372]  Big broadcast with some huge guests coming up later today I'll be telling you about.
[00:01:13.372 --> 00:01:14.713]  But what is today?
[00:01:14.713 --> 00:01:17.894]  Today is a very important day, obviously.
[00:01:18.931 --> 00:01:42.917]  Today is the one-year anniversary of the launching of Vladimir Putin's so-called police action or special military operation into Ukraine and the kickoff of what has now become the beginning of World War III and all of the things that that entails.
[00:01:42.917 --> 00:01:45.278]  We'll be spending some time on that today, obviously.
[00:01:46.693 --> 00:01:49.955]  But in the first hour, I want to talk about the other wars that are going on.
[00:01:49.955 --> 00:01:53.878]  The wars, the culture wars, who's running it, what's behind it.
[00:01:53.878 --> 00:01:58.181]  Because at ground level, the culture wars are very real.
[00:01:58.181 --> 00:02:15.152]  If you're a very unlucky, very rare, by the way, black person that is actually killed by the KKK and drugged behind a truck until your head comes off, like happened in a real Texas case 15 years ago or so, then that's a real race war for you.
[00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:25.911]  And if you're a white person, statistically, 20 plus times more likely to be attacked by a black person than for a black person to be attacked by a white person, according to the FBI's statistics.
[00:02:25.911 --> 00:02:29.192]  That's a very real war at the ground level.
[00:02:29.192 --> 00:02:40.514]  But still, the number of white people killed by black people is tiny compared to all of us dying from these poison shots that have taken them and getting sick and
[00:02:41.795 --> 00:02:51.818]  The chemicals and the biologicals, the radiologicals being introduced in our environments and the 5G and just all the GMO crops and the glyphosates and the dioxins.
[00:02:51.818 --> 00:02:54.559]  That's the real problem.
[00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:56.460]  And look, it's real red meat.
[00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:07.243]  I can show you 20 videos today that are new of racist, out of control, crazy black people beating up, pushing white people onto railroad tracks, killing white people.
[00:03:08.453 --> 00:03:13.937]  I can also show you 30 videos that are new today of black people killing black people.
[00:03:13.937 --> 00:03:16.458]  Those don't seem to be as hot on the internet.
[00:03:16.458 --> 00:03:27.025]  And the bottom line is there is a minority of black people, a minority of that minority in this country, that are viciously racist and that are attacking white people.
[00:03:28.098 --> 00:03:32.899]  And the way the media covers it up and all the rest of it is terrible, and it's the media helping drive it.
[00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:40.900]  But I want to put in context this today, that the people attacking us all are the real issues.
[00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.421]  And I'm not an apologist for black-on-white crime.
[00:03:43.421 --> 00:03:50.902]  In fact, the contrary, we talk a lot about it, but it's almost like covering the Ohio train derailment and saying it's the biggest news story.
[00:03:50.902 --> 00:03:51.862]  It is important.
[00:03:51.862 --> 00:03:56.643]  The government not caring is important, but compared to World War III or the poison shots, it doesn't even show up on the Richter scale.
[00:03:57.335 --> 00:03:58.916]  Doesn't mean I don't care about Ohio.
[00:03:58.916 --> 00:04:00.057]  And it's the same thing.
[00:04:00.057 --> 00:04:06.540]  So the numbers of white people being killed by blacks every year is over 10,000 or so.
[00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:12.544]  That sounds like a big number, but out of 350 million people, it's a problem.
[00:04:12.544 --> 00:04:20.188]  But it is tiny compared to, again, how the whole New World Order agenda is attacking everybody.
[00:04:20.188 --> 00:04:26.492]  But the globalists pushing the race war and how that fits into their larger control system
[00:04:28.075 --> 00:04:30.137]  Is one of the top issues.
[00:04:30.137 --> 00:04:38.964]  Because the division it creates, and the way it allows them to control people, and divide society, and divide and conquer, that's the big one.
[00:04:38.964 --> 00:04:42.747]  What made me really want to talk about this, I was already talking about it the last few days, is Scott Adams.
[00:04:42.747 --> 00:04:52.695]  I think he's a smart guy, I like Scott Adams, but he came out with something that he knows is a massive troll, and that would get a lot of attention.
[00:04:52.695 --> 00:04:56.819]  And part of what he says I think is accurate, but we'll talk about it when we come back.
[00:05:01.345 --> 00:05:13.316]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to InfoWarsaw.com and gotten the great products that enrich your life and empower your immune system and your body and keep us on air.
[00:05:13.316 --> 00:05:17.660]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in
[00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.661]  Many of you for years have never gone to Infowars.com.
[00:05:21.661 --> 00:05:30.444]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to Infowars.com and never experience these great products and never find the operation.
[00:05:30.444 --> 00:05:33.505]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show.
[00:05:33.505 --> 00:05:34.885]  That's great and I thank you.
[00:05:34.885 --> 00:05:36.386]  But we need funds to operate.
[00:05:36.386 --> 00:05:45.248]  Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people like our CBD oil and our Fizzy Magnesium and our Sleep Aid and our Nitric Oxide and our Real Red Pill Plus.
[00:05:45.248 --> 00:05:46.729]  All of these are really great products.
[00:05:46.869 --> 00:05:47.369]  I think so.
[00:06:17.416 --> 00:06:20.199]  All the hip young things trying to make a scene.
[00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:23.802]  It's Friday, February 24th, 2023.
[00:06:23.802 --> 00:06:25.803]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:06:25.803 --> 00:06:33.910]  Very honored you've chosen to join us today with your very important precious time.
[00:06:43.522 --> 00:06:45.984]  Well, here we are on the one-year anniversary.
[00:06:45.984 --> 00:07:01.274]  Twelve months ago today, the Russians launched their invasion of Ukraine, and it was a massive invasion, and Putin walked right into a bear trap of the CIA and NATO with high-tech missiles and weapons and satellite-directed weapons, and absolutely slaughtered the Russians.
[00:07:01.274 --> 00:07:02.275]  It's probably over 100,000.
[00:07:02.275 --> 00:07:05.637]  That's a low estimate.
[00:07:05.637 --> 00:07:08.679]  But the Russians have doggedly continued on and killed
[00:07:09.286 --> 00:07:13.531]  The reports are 200,000 Ukrainians, which is terrible.
[00:07:13.531 --> 00:07:20.298]  And the whole thing is a disaster and is another example of humanity being played off against each other.
[00:07:20.298 --> 00:07:23.341]  We'll be talking more about that here on the broadcast today.
[00:07:23.341 --> 00:07:26.285]  But I want to talk about the other wars going on.
[00:07:26.285 --> 00:07:27.346]  The electromagnetic 5G.
[00:07:28.627 --> 00:07:44.253]  The radiation, the toxicity, the bisphenol, the dioxins, the gender-bending chemicals, the cancer exploding, millions dead from the poison shots, tens of millions sick, global government, mass censorship, control.
[00:07:44.253 --> 00:07:56.057]  And if you look at Europe, or you look at the United States, the globalists admit they don't want a wealthy large middle class and for people in Africa, in Latin America, in Asia, in the Middle East to aspire
[00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:04.002]  To owning a home with a two-car garage and two cars and going on vacation three times a year and having access to medical care.
[00:08:04.002 --> 00:08:09.963]  They don't want the gluttonous, wasteful, Western American idea of progress.
[00:08:09.963 --> 00:08:11.904]  They admit that they're at war against it.
[00:08:11.904 --> 00:08:14.024]  The tiny elite want you poor.
[00:08:14.024 --> 00:08:23.947]  And so how did 10,000, on average, British soldiers in the subcontinent of India in the last few hundred years control hundreds of millions of people?
[00:08:24.645 --> 00:08:28.768]  Millions today, but they haven't controlled things since Mahatma Gandhi.
[00:08:28.768 --> 00:08:36.013]  They did it by divide and conquer and using sociology and anthropology to study the local tribal rifts and groups.
[00:08:36.013 --> 00:08:54.465]  And even though genetically the Indians are a very genetically similar group, 10,000 British soldiers on average conquered and held for hundreds of years and exploited that subcontinent.
[00:08:55.379 --> 00:08:56.820]  So it's the same thing.
[00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.322]  Now, villagers had real issues with each other.
[00:08:59.322 --> 00:09:15.112]  You know, somebody's grandpa killed somebody's daddy, somebody's mama married somebody in the wrong tribe, and the British would go in for a few years, stay the situation, bring in some money, buy off key leaders, form alliances, and take full control.
[00:09:15.112 --> 00:09:23.838]  And that's what this is from the 35,000 foot view, shipping in 30 million Muslims into Europe the last 15 years, shipping in
[00:09:26.311 --> 00:09:35.896]  60, 70 million illegal aliens into the United States the last 30 years, and then hyping them up towards anti-American, anti-white inclinations.
[00:09:35.896 --> 00:09:39.478]  All of that is real, but it's a mechanism of the control.
[00:09:41.223 --> 00:09:48.409]  Now I'm not some bleeding heart liberal that wants to kiss black people's ass and try to curry favor and tell them how much I like them and all the rest of that.
[00:09:48.409 --> 00:09:53.033]  I see people as people of what they stand for and who they are in their lives.
[00:09:53.033 --> 00:09:55.955]  I don't listen to Jimi Hendrix because he was black.
[00:09:55.955 --> 00:10:02.041]  I listen to him because he's probably the greatest guitarist and songwriter ever.
[00:10:02.041 --> 00:10:03.162]  Or one of the greats.
[00:10:03.162 --> 00:10:08.446]  I don't listen to Ludwig van Beethoven because he was German.
[00:10:08.446 --> 00:10:09.467]  And I'm about half German.
[00:10:10.111 --> 00:10:18.675]  I listen to him because he's an incredible musician and composer.
[00:10:18.675 --> 00:10:19.375]  It's the same thing.
[00:10:19.375 --> 00:10:23.777]  I don't go to a Chinese food restaurant to virtue signal the Chinese people.
[00:10:23.777 --> 00:10:28.199]  I go there if it's real Chinese food and delicious.
[00:10:28.199 --> 00:10:33.562]  I go eat soul food when I got time in East Austin even though it's dangerous because they got the best collard greens and
[00:10:34.758 --> 00:10:37.259]  Chicken fried steaks and sweet potatoes.
[00:10:37.259 --> 00:10:39.540]  I'm out there to virtually signal to black people.
[00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:42.261]  I'm there to eat that food.
[00:10:42.261 --> 00:10:46.942]  So bottom line, folks, I know black people real well.
[00:10:46.942 --> 00:10:49.003]  I grew up in Dallas, Texas.
[00:10:49.003 --> 00:10:51.024]  It's half black.
[00:10:51.024 --> 00:10:55.426]  Most of black people were fun and cool and nice and loved me.
[00:10:55.426 --> 00:10:57.886]  But I've been racially attacked.
[00:10:57.886 --> 00:10:58.907]  Let's not exaggerate.
[00:10:58.907 --> 00:11:01.928]  50 times because I was white.
[00:11:03.103 --> 00:11:04.683]  Do I blame the rest of the black people for that?
[00:11:04.683 --> 00:11:06.244]  No.
[00:11:06.244 --> 00:11:16.767]  But also because I went to the wrong bonfire in the wrong redneck area, I've been in about 25 fights attacked by rednecks, look just like me, wearing cowboy hats and cowboy boots.
[00:11:16.767 --> 00:11:26.910]  But I was there, didn't know the girl I brought, had broke up with somebody six months before, all of a sudden I got somebody hit me in the head with a pair of post hole diggers.
[00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:32.512]  Does that mean anytime I see people wearing cowboy hats and cowboy boots, I get all scared and think they're about to attack me?
[00:11:32.512 --> 00:11:32.632]  No.
[00:11:36.991 --> 00:11:41.753]  But yes, ladies and gentlemen, I didn't even realize it growing up.
[00:11:41.753 --> 00:11:43.293]  My parents weren't liberal or politically correct.
[00:11:43.293 --> 00:11:46.474]  They just said, you can just go be tough.
[00:11:46.474 --> 00:11:53.417]  But I guarantee you, there aren't any black people listening to this show that have been attacked by white people physically 50 times.
[00:11:53.417 --> 00:12:01.079]  I'll bet you all the money on earth, is there any black person that's been attacked by black people 50 times?
[00:12:01.079 --> 00:12:02.940]  By the way, I'm a tough son of a bitch because of that.
[00:12:05.293 --> 00:12:11.978]  I've had concussions so bad I couldn't see for a week.
[00:12:11.978 --> 00:12:14.740]  And I've beat black people and put them in comas.
[00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:20.124]  Because when you're fighting for your life, that's what you do.
[00:12:20.124 --> 00:12:23.247]  I had five Mexicans break my leg when I was 16.
[00:12:23.247 --> 00:12:23.967]  Do I hate Mexicans?
[00:12:23.967 --> 00:12:27.930]  No.
[00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:28.691]  That's a whole other story.
[00:12:30.868 --> 00:12:42.043]  But the point is, ladies and gentlemen, the people manipulating this from the top know exactly what they're doing.
[00:12:42.043 --> 00:12:49.112]  So when a horde of Muslims come out of their no-go zones in Belgium or in Paris, France, or in London, England,
[00:12:51.414 --> 00:12:57.295]  And beat and stab and kill and rape in some towns, thousands of white girls per town.
[00:12:57.295 --> 00:13:01.616]  The police turn a blind eye because you're not allowed to say that Muslims do something wrong.
[00:13:01.616 --> 00:13:04.997]  They call them Asian grooming gangs.
[00:13:04.997 --> 00:13:07.778]  So we've all got beefs.
[00:13:07.778 --> 00:13:12.999]  And I don't want to hear black people whining and bitch at me for something white people did hundreds of years ago.
[00:13:12.999 --> 00:13:15.839]  And I don't want to hear about your reparations for something I didn't do.
[00:13:15.839 --> 00:13:19.340]  If my daddy was a murderer, I don't go to jail for it.
[00:13:20.188 --> 00:13:21.368]  If my grandma robs a bank, I don't go to jail for it.
[00:13:21.368 --> 00:13:45.796]  If my great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great
[00:13:46.841 --> 00:13:59.113]  And what brings me to this point to understand this war of psychological control is you've got to recognize that the left and Hollywood and the whole culture says white people are evil and they're bad and they deserve to die.
[00:13:59.113 --> 00:14:08.601]  And so there's a minority of young black males that are out with a knockout game and pushing people on railroad tracks and pushing people on subway tracks and stabbing and shooting people.
[00:14:08.601 --> 00:14:10.343]  Yeah, that's going on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:12.316 --> 00:14:25.583]  And robbing and killing and stealing it just like it was white people doing it in the roaring 1920s and the gangsters because it was cool and because the police lost control.
[00:14:25.583 --> 00:14:29.185]  So is there a dangerous gangster culture in America predominantly in the black community?
[00:14:29.185 --> 00:14:30.885]  Hell yeah.
[00:14:30.885 --> 00:14:33.647]  Has the left made it open season to attack white people?
[00:14:33.647 --> 00:14:34.947]  Hell yeah.
[00:14:34.947 --> 00:14:40.310]  Is the controlled corporate media all over the news saying white people are bad and they're inherently evil?
[00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:41.791]  Is there a Rasmussen poll out?
[00:14:43.439 --> 00:14:59.351]  Where almost a majority of black people that they talk to fundamentally believe because someone's skin is white, they are a bad person.
[00:14:59.351 --> 00:15:07.477]  So how does the media call people that don't support tyranny or wars, Nazis, when Jordan Soros literally worked for the Nazis and runs the whole current system?
[00:15:10.123 --> 00:15:17.265]  And then how do they create racial division in this country as the left and then turn around and call us all racists when they're obviously the race pimps controlling it?
[00:15:17.265 --> 00:15:18.145]  That's what I'm getting at.
[00:15:18.145 --> 00:15:23.667]  So when we come back, Scott Adams puts out a video that's gone mega-viral.
[00:15:23.667 --> 00:15:24.667]  I want to try to get him on the show.
[00:15:24.667 --> 00:15:27.147]  He's been on before.
[00:15:27.147 --> 00:15:35.990]  And says, you better get away from black people and you better run from them.
[00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:36.970]  Is that really the answer?
[00:15:38.351 --> 00:15:46.018]  Because you can run all day long from your problems, but until you engage those problems, it's not going to get better.
[00:15:46.018 --> 00:15:46.758]  It's going to get worse.
[00:15:46.758 --> 00:15:48.480]  We're going to play this clip.
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.080]  We're going to come back.
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:52.223]  We're going to talk about it on the other side.
[00:15:52.223 --> 00:15:55.946]  No, black people are not the problem.
[00:15:55.946 --> 00:15:56.847]  Evil is the problem.
[00:16:00.768 --> 00:16:08.976]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic book that documents the globalists in their own words, planned for our future.
[00:16:08.976 --> 00:16:10.418]  That is the hellish future.
[00:16:10.418 --> 00:16:19.347]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or Infowarshore.com.
[00:16:19.827 --> 00:16:25.410]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:27.991]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[00:16:27.991 --> 00:16:33.373]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy, at InfoWarsHore.com.
[00:16:33.373 --> 00:16:37.315]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[00:16:37.315 --> 00:16:43.198]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you help keep InfoWars on the air.
[00:16:43.198 --> 00:16:45.279]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book.
[00:16:46.079 --> 00:16:47.120]  Or unsigned copies.
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:57.491]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to infowarshaw.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library or give them to the local school.
[00:16:57.491 --> 00:16:58.532]  This is an InfoWar.
[00:16:58.532 --> 00:17:00.414]  I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[00:17:00.414 --> 00:17:01.355]  I've got some good news.
[00:17:02.396 --> 00:17:09.279]  Our high-quality supplements really work, and we have about an 80% reorder rate with customers.
[00:17:09.279 --> 00:17:10.100]  That's the good news.
[00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:11.240]  They're amazing.
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:19.424]  The bad news is, around 1% or a little less of our actual viewers and listeners never go to InfoWareStore.com and ever actually buy the products.
[00:17:19.424 --> 00:17:22.866]  So you're missing out on these products, plus it funds the InfoWare.
[00:17:22.866 --> 00:17:27.788]  Think of what we've done with just 1% of our massive audience actually buying products.
[00:17:27.788 --> 00:17:28.629]  Think what would happen.
[00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:43.073]  If those of you on the fence actually went to InfowarStore.com and got some of these amazing products, I would recommend Turmeric 95 for your joints, your bones, inflammation, to get one of the biggest effects, so you reorder it and see how great it is.
[00:17:43.073 --> 00:17:52.035]  Also, we've got the super high-quality, full-spectrum CBD oil that's so good for your neurological systems, your brain, your joints, your bones as well.
[00:17:52.035 --> 00:17:53.416]  Or Real Red Pill Plus.
[00:17:53.416 --> 00:17:57.357]  Just go try the product, fund the Infowar, and help us defeat the New World Order together.
[00:17:57.837 --> 00:18:02.081]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:18:02.081 --> 00:18:05.344]  Humanity is in a fight for its very life.
[00:18:05.344 --> 00:18:11.771]  And Infowars, for decades, has been at the very forefront of the fight for a pro-human future.
[00:18:11.771 --> 00:18:13.412]  We can't stay on air without your help.
[00:18:13.412 --> 00:18:15.454]  And I want to thank you all for your past support.
[00:18:15.454 --> 00:18:22.401]  And I want to encourage those of you that have never bought products at Infowarsstore.com to go there and experience how amazing these products really are.
[00:18:22.941 --> 00:18:27.184]  Ultimate Bone Broth, finally sold out for over two years, back in stock.
[00:18:27.184 --> 00:18:29.945]  Real Red Pill Plus, simply amazing.
[00:18:29.945 --> 00:18:33.928]  Nitric, boosts what it does for your heart, your cardiovascular, critical.
[00:18:33.928 --> 00:18:41.993]  All these products, like Ultimate Krill Oil, Ultimate Fish Oil, Supermelt Vitality, they're all available and in stock, ready to ship to you, right now at infowarestore.com.
[00:18:41.993 --> 00:18:50.978]  And the final 1,200 signed copies of my book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, and I'm not gonna sign anymore after that, are exclusively available at infowarestore.com as well.
[00:18:51.118 --> 00:18:53.540]  In the last month, I got a little busy, so I didn't sign the books.
[00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:54.420]  We didn't have them for sale.
[00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:56.182]  But now, I signed the last books.
[00:18:56.182 --> 00:19:04.628]  You can get them right now.
[00:19:04.628 --> 00:19:06.389]  This is their big move.
[00:19:06.389 --> 00:19:10.192]  So, yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[00:19:10.192 --> 00:19:11.893]  He doesn't care.
[00:19:11.893 --> 00:19:13.154]  That's not his job.
[00:19:13.154 --> 00:19:14.896]  He's not the President of the United States.
[00:19:14.896 --> 00:19:18.759]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[00:19:18.759 --> 00:19:20.140]  Appetites of the autocrat.
[00:19:21.038 --> 00:19:23.239]  Cannot be appeased.
[00:19:23.239 --> 00:19:24.979]  They must be opposed.
[00:19:24.979 --> 00:19:28.400]  Autocrats only understand one word.
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.580]  No.
[00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:30.421]  No.
[00:19:30.421 --> 00:19:31.181]  No.
[00:19:31.181 --> 00:19:32.081]  Exactly.
[00:19:32.081 --> 00:19:35.642]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[00:19:35.642 --> 00:19:38.743]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[00:19:38.743 --> 00:19:41.223]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[00:19:41.223 --> 00:19:43.724]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[00:19:43.724 --> 00:19:47.345]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[00:19:47.345 --> 00:19:49.866]  We say no to you getting us into World War III.
[00:19:49.866 --> 00:19:50.266]  You're right.
[00:19:50.566 --> 00:19:55.311]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden, and we say no!
[00:19:55.311 --> 00:20:00.957]  And we say no to your war!
[00:20:00.957 --> 00:20:05.582]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:20:05.582 --> 00:20:06.864]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.461]  Welcome back to this Friday edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:18.461 --> 00:20:23.204]  Big guests coming up second and third hour today.
[00:20:23.204 --> 00:20:29.988]  Alright, so Dilbert creator Scott Adams warns white people, get the hell away from blacks.
[00:20:29.988 --> 00:20:35.092]  His polls show they're not okay with being white.
[00:20:35.092 --> 00:20:40.275]  And you know, we've sold t-shirts that say it's okay to be white.
[00:20:40.275 --> 00:20:45.398]  But the shirt I really like was, it's great to be black, it's great to be brown, it's great to be yellow, it's great to be white.
[00:20:46.001 --> 00:20:47.742]  It's great to be human.
[00:20:47.742 --> 00:21:07.590]  The whole way the globalist wind is dividing us, but it is true that I wouldn't want to live in a high-crime area regardless of it was a mixed high-crime area or mainly a black high-crime area because there's a high level of criminals there who are also mainly the most dangerous person to a black person other than an abortionist doctor is black people.
[00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:09.731]  You think the average black guy that works as a
[00:21:11.917 --> 00:21:18.664]  Waiter or as a bus driver or as an auto mechanic with three kids.
[00:21:18.664 --> 00:21:22.008]  Think he hates white people and wants to kill white people?
[00:21:22.008 --> 00:21:28.334]  No, he works a couple white guys down at the auto repair shop.
[00:21:28.334 --> 00:21:32.399]  And then if a black guy goes and gets a couple degrees and goes and moves into a nicer house, well, people call him a sellout.
[00:21:33.683 --> 00:21:39.089]  This is all the garbage that goes on, ladies and gentlemen, and we all know about it, and we all understand it.
[00:21:39.089 --> 00:21:40.670]  We need to see where it's coming from.
[00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:41.891]  Well, I said we all know.
[00:21:41.891 --> 00:21:44.434]  A lot of us don't know.
[00:21:44.434 --> 00:21:50.280]  And so I don't blame people for getting away from high crime areas, no matter what color you are.
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:53.964]  But defunding the police, all of this is designed to create this crime wave.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:01.744]  You got the new Black Panther Party saying, I've had one of the guys on that says this openly in Houston, don't go out and mug black people, go mug white people.
[00:22:01.744 --> 00:22:03.345]  And that's a message, and that's happening.
[00:22:03.345 --> 00:22:07.148]  And a lot of black folks get killed trying to rob white people.
[00:22:07.148 --> 00:22:08.669]  They need to stop.
[00:22:08.669 --> 00:22:11.470]  And I'm decrying that.
[00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:22.878]  But Scott Adams is saying the quiet part out loud that some of you are saying that were white liberals, that were going along with, oh, let's be really nice, let's lift everybody up, and then now all they see is it blowing up in their face, so they say, oh,
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:27.283]  Let's just not be around black people.
[00:22:27.283 --> 00:22:28.604]  You say, well, that's super racist.
[00:22:28.604 --> 00:22:31.626]  Well, the college is all over the place.
[00:22:31.626 --> 00:22:40.013]  The left is segregating black people, telling them to segregate, saying, oh, whites can't come to college this weekend.
[00:22:40.013 --> 00:22:41.294]  It's only for minorities.
[00:22:41.294 --> 00:22:45.378]  The left is creating this chip on the shoulder scenario.
[00:22:45.378 --> 00:22:47.159]  You see all the examples everywhere.
[00:22:47.159 --> 00:22:51.723]  Hundreds of movies a year about slavery and white slave owners and Django and on and on and on.
[00:22:52.384 --> 00:23:01.812]  And weak-minded people watch that, and they listen to Black Lives Matter with its George Soros ideology, and they go out and they hate white people.
[00:23:01.812 --> 00:23:04.374]  I was talking to Norm Pattis last night, he's a liberal.
[00:23:04.374 --> 00:23:07.497]  He's been there for months with the Proud Boys trial in D.C.
[00:23:07.497 --> 00:23:11.720]  His co-counsel, for no reason, is an old white guy.
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:15.744]  Black guy comes up and says, I hate you white people drinking Diet Coke, and knocks his front teacup.
[00:23:18.868 --> 00:23:24.012]  Norm Pattis has gone in a store because he's a jogger and his shoe sole came off.
[00:23:24.012 --> 00:23:27.676]  He went in the store of Macy's to buy some shoes.
[00:23:27.676 --> 00:23:29.297]  And the black people said, we're not going to serve you.
[00:23:29.297 --> 00:23:30.298]  You're a white person.
[00:23:30.298 --> 00:23:32.940]  He's coming on the show Sunday to talk about it.
[00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:34.542]  He says he wants to get the hell out of there.
[00:23:34.542 --> 00:23:37.764]  Not because he dislikes black people, because they don't want him there.
[00:23:37.764 --> 00:23:41.708]  And this is what the culture has created.
[00:23:41.708 --> 00:23:42.909]  And let's just be honest about it.
[00:23:46.701 --> 00:23:49.022]  But the answer is exposing the ideology.
[00:23:49.022 --> 00:23:52.264]  The answer is getting in the face of the ideology.
[00:23:52.264 --> 00:23:56.847]  Because let me tell you what happens when I go in a black area.
[00:23:56.847 --> 00:24:01.330]  See, the black people don't know who the average white guy is in their neighborhood.
[00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:02.731]  And most of them are nice.
[00:24:02.731 --> 00:24:07.034]  But there's a good portion that are extremely racist and will say things to you.
[00:24:07.034 --> 00:24:09.655]  Go try it for yourself.
[00:24:09.655 --> 00:24:10.876]  Tells you to crack your head doing it.
[00:24:10.876 --> 00:24:11.957]  Someone's going to beat your ass.
[00:24:11.957 --> 00:24:13.438]  You don't get the hell out of here.
[00:24:13.438 --> 00:24:15.499]  You talk back, you're going to get knocked upside the head.
[00:24:20.014 --> 00:24:23.737]  That'll happen with Alex Jones.
[00:24:23.737 --> 00:24:29.182]  I go in a black neighborhood, and you've seen it on TV when I'm out in crowds all over the place, New York.
[00:24:29.182 --> 00:24:31.985]  A bunch of black people know who I am, they love me, and they run, oh we love Alex Jones!
[00:24:31.985 --> 00:24:34.127]  And the other black people go, well he must be cool, see?
[00:24:34.127 --> 00:24:36.949]  See, cause then, oh, the black people like him, he must be nice.
[00:24:36.949 --> 00:24:38.170]  Well then they don't dislike me.
[00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:44.656]  Because somebody did something racist to them, or somebody discriminated against them, or the media opened that wound up over and over again.
[00:24:44.656 --> 00:24:46.358]  So see, I get to have that experience.
[00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:53.903]  The people that aren't well-known or aren't famous don't know.
[00:24:53.903 --> 00:24:55.444]  You hear how many black colleagues we have on the show?
[00:24:55.444 --> 00:24:56.325]  They know all about the new world order.
[00:24:56.325 --> 00:24:57.425]  They know about being screwed over.
[00:24:57.425 --> 00:24:58.646]  They've been screwed over.
[00:24:58.646 --> 00:25:09.614]  And now the same system says it wants to help them, and it's screwing them over even more by manipulating some of the weak-minded people in their race to go out and act like a bunch of black versions of the KKK!
[00:25:11.098 --> 00:25:12.798]  KKK thought it was under attack.
[00:25:12.798 --> 00:25:14.319]  KKK thought it was in the right.
[00:25:14.319 --> 00:25:22.381]  KKK didn't like seeing black people have cars and jobs and restaurants and businesses they own, so they'd go burn them down.
[00:25:22.381 --> 00:25:28.922]  And that's what the racist black people that are racist think, because the media told them so.
[00:25:28.922 --> 00:25:35.244]  And they're taking what Martin Luther King rightfully stood for and flushing it down the toilet.
[00:25:35.244 --> 00:25:39.205]  So I get what Scott Adams is saying, but I don't see Mike Adams.
[00:25:39.205 --> 00:25:40.025]  Scott Adams is saying.
[00:25:41.775 --> 00:25:43.816]  But I think there's a bigger picture here.
[00:25:43.816 --> 00:25:54.423]  But you can't call him a racist when the left's saying whites are inherently bad, and it's not okay to be white, and almost 50% of blacks in this Rasmussen poll, you know they poll liberals, said that.
[00:25:54.423 --> 00:25:59.927]  This is a system turning the knife, dividing us, controlling us, so we're distracted while they screw us over.
[00:25:59.927 --> 00:26:01.928]  Here it is.
[00:26:01.928 --> 00:26:04.510]  Rasmussen asked, you know, white and black voters,
[00:26:06.003 --> 00:26:08.846]  And probably others.
[00:26:08.846 --> 00:26:15.012]  Do you disagree or agree with the statement, it's okay to be white?
[00:26:15.012 --> 00:26:20.176]  26% of blacks said no.
[00:26:20.176 --> 00:26:21.478]  It's not okay to be white.
[00:26:21.478 --> 00:26:23.780]  21% weren't sure.
[00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:26.002]  Add them together, that is 47% of black respondents
[00:26:30.382 --> 00:26:33.084]  We're not willing to say it's okay to be white.
[00:26:33.084 --> 00:26:45.235]  So if nearly half of all blacks are not okay with white people, according to this poll, not according to me, according to this poll, that's a hate group.
[00:26:45.235 --> 00:26:46.736]  That's a hate group.
[00:26:46.736 --> 00:26:49.398]  And I don't want to have anything to do with them.
[00:26:49.398 --> 00:26:58.426]  And I would say, based on the current way things are going, the best advice I would give to white people is to get the hell away from black people.
[00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:01.911]  Just get the **** away.
[00:27:01.911 --> 00:27:04.293]  Wherever you have to go, just get away.
[00:27:04.293 --> 00:27:08.515]  Because there's no fixing this.
[00:27:08.515 --> 00:27:10.896]  This can't be fixed.
[00:27:10.896 --> 00:27:11.176]  Right?
[00:27:11.176 --> 00:27:12.497]  This can't be fixed.
[00:27:12.497 --> 00:27:14.518]  You just have to escape.
[00:27:14.518 --> 00:27:15.258]  So that's what I did.
[00:27:15.258 --> 00:27:19.260]  I went to a neighborhood where, you know, I have a very low black population.
[00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:24.303]  Because unfortunately, you know, there's a high correlation between the density.
[00:27:24.303 --> 00:27:27.004]  This is according to Don Lemon, by the way.
[00:27:27.004 --> 00:27:28.645]  So here I'm just quoting Don Lemon.
[00:27:30.193 --> 00:27:39.720]  When he notes that when he lived in a mostly black neighborhood, there were a bunch of problems that he didn't see in white neighborhoods.
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:49.147]  So even Don Lemon sees a big difference in your own quality of living based on where you live and who's there.
[00:27:49.147 --> 00:27:56.853]  So I think it makes no sense whatsoever as a white citizen of America to try to help black citizens anymore.
[00:27:57.893 --> 00:27:59.434]  It doesn't make sense.
[00:27:59.434 --> 00:28:03.915]  It's no longer a rational impulse.
[00:28:03.915 --> 00:28:12.798]  And so I'm going to back off from being helpful to black America because it doesn't seem like it pays off.
[00:28:12.798 --> 00:28:18.520]  Like I've been doing it all my life and the only outcome is I get called a racist.
[00:28:20.609 --> 00:28:23.792]  And that's what the left wants, is it's all divided into different groups.
[00:28:23.792 --> 00:28:27.815]  It doesn't mean when the left says, we represent black people and here's their demands.
[00:28:27.815 --> 00:28:32.578]  No, that's the left controlling groups and claiming that they represent them.
[00:28:32.578 --> 00:28:40.024]  So I get not wanting to live in a high crime area regardless of who lives there, but to say, oh, I'm not going to help blacks.
[00:28:40.024 --> 00:28:41.045]  Well, what does that even mean?
[00:28:42.626 --> 00:28:44.028]  What does that mean?
[00:28:44.028 --> 00:28:49.475]  Like, you're gonna judge other black people completely off of what other black people do?
[00:28:49.475 --> 00:28:50.095]  I mean, I get it.
[00:28:50.095 --> 00:28:57.484]  Young black males, a large minority of them, but it's a chunk, are absolutely out of control.
[00:28:57.484 --> 00:29:01.349]  But you're gonna blame... Right now.
[00:29:02.406 --> 00:29:12.839]  I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to InfoWarsTore.com and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body and keep us on air.
[00:29:12.839 --> 00:29:17.164]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in
[00:29:17.745 --> 00:29:21.189]  Many of you for years have never gone to InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:29:21.189 --> 00:29:29.698]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to InfoWarsTore.com and never experience these great products and never find the operation.
[00:29:29.698 --> 00:29:33.042]  I'm sure you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show.
[00:29:33.042 --> 00:29:33.983]  That's great and I thank you.
[00:29:34.403 --> 00:29:35.924]  But we need funds to operate.
[00:29:35.924 --> 00:29:44.766]  Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people, like our CBD oil, and our Fizzy Magnesium, and our Sweep Aid, and our Nitric Oxide, and our Real Red Pill Plus.
[00:29:44.766 --> 00:29:47.227]  All of these are really great products that keep us on air.
[00:29:47.227 --> 00:29:49.008]  Plus, you're missing out on having these products.
[00:29:49.008 --> 00:29:50.308]  So get off the bench.
[00:29:50.308 --> 00:29:51.169]  Get in the game.
[00:29:51.169 --> 00:29:57.911]  Step to the plate, and go to InfoWarsTore.com right now and get these great InfoWars products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:30:00.168 --> 00:30:02.150]  I've got some good news.
[00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:09.035]  Our high-quality supplements really work, and we have about an 80% reorder rate with customers.
[00:30:09.035 --> 00:30:09.855]  That's the good news.
[00:30:09.855 --> 00:30:10.996]  They're amazing.
[00:30:10.996 --> 00:30:19.182]  The bad news is, around 1% or a little less of our actual viewers and listeners ever go to infowarestore.com and ever actually buy the products.
[00:30:19.182 --> 00:30:22.625]  So you're missing out on these products, plus it funds the info war.
[00:30:22.625 --> 00:30:27.549]  Think of what we've done with just 1% of our massive audience actually buying products.
[00:30:27.549 --> 00:30:28.389]  Think what would happen.
[00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:42.841]  If those of you on the fence actually went to InfowarStore.com and got some of these amazing products, I would recommend Turmeric 95 for your joints, your bones, inflammation, to get one of the biggest effects, so you reorder it and see how great it is.

[00:31:42.862 --> 00:31:48.385]  Or a great Fizzy Magnesium product, or whether it's counting out our great Sleep A, that's back in stock.
[00:31:48.385 --> 00:31:49.045]  It's all there.
[00:31:49.045 --> 00:31:50.886]  Our Turmeric 95% Humanoid.
[00:31:50.886 --> 00:31:52.607]  Strongest out there, Turmeric 95.

[00:32:02.853 --> 00:32:07.717]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies.
[00:32:07.717 --> 00:32:13.042]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication, it takes commitment.
[00:32:13.042 --> 00:32:23.070]  That's why I ask listeners respectfully to go to infowarestore.com and buy great products that will enrich and empower your life while keeping us on air at the very same time.

[00:32:51.147 --> 00:32:55.369]  These are great products that really work and are amazing, plus they keep us on air.

[00:33:01.132 --> 00:33:07.035]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:13.457 --> 00:33:25.006]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:25.006 --> 00:33:33.292]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:33.292 --> 00:33:38.536]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:38.536 --> 00:33:42.439]  Coming up, several special big guests today.
[00:33:43.988 --> 00:33:46.729]  Owen Schroer in studio as well, co-hosting.
[00:33:46.729 --> 00:33:49.530]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:50.510]  All right.
[00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:56.312]  So, Scott Adams, if he wants to not live around black people, that's his right.
[00:33:56.312 --> 00:34:00.913]  And if people want to live away from crime, period, wherever it's coming from, I totally get it.
[00:34:00.913 --> 00:34:03.534]  But to say, I'm done with black people.
[00:34:03.534 --> 00:34:06.594]  They hate me.
[00:34:06.594 --> 00:34:07.635]  So I don't like them.
[00:34:07.635 --> 00:34:11.976]  Well, you're only 20 something percent that said they definitely don't like white people.
[00:34:12.905 --> 00:34:15.826]  27% said they weren't sure because they're like, well, I'm politically correct.
[00:34:15.826 --> 00:34:18.626]  I'm supposed to just like whites, right?
[00:34:18.626 --> 00:34:22.247]  So we're going to take 50% or more and then say, well, they're all bad.
[00:34:22.247 --> 00:34:26.728]  That's how the globalists play us off against each other.
[00:34:26.728 --> 00:34:29.689]  That's like, yay.
[00:34:29.689 --> 00:34:37.371]  Here's his props when he was in here in December last year with the Yoo-Hoo, Net and Yoo-Hoo, Net and Yahoo.
[00:34:37.371 --> 00:34:40.652]  And just because he's had some bad experiences with Jews in Hollywood,
[00:34:41.601 --> 00:34:44.142]  Not all of Hollywood's horrible.
[00:34:44.142 --> 00:34:48.304]  He just says all Jews are bad or he doesn't trust them.
[00:34:48.304 --> 00:35:03.450]  And it's been the left promoting this idea that white people are inherently bad, so if Jews are white, well, how can the left say white people are bad, inherently evil because of their skin color, but then Jews are okay?
[00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:06.611]  I'm not defending what Ye said here.
[00:35:06.611 --> 00:35:07.632]  I disagree with him when he was here.
[00:35:08.692 --> 00:35:20.259]  But, I couldn't get that upset, when if you tune into CNN, their anti-white bias, mainly white people teaching blacks how to believe that, brainwashing them, it's the same thing.
[00:35:20.259 --> 00:35:26.822]  It's absolutely the same garbage.
[00:35:26.822 --> 00:35:32.146]  Over, and over, and over again.
[00:35:32.146 --> 00:35:34.387]  And then you got people
[00:35:37.429 --> 00:35:48.812]  Like Jon Stewart, whose brother used to run the New York Stock Exchange, big insider, saying Alex Jones is a wolf in wolf's clothing, but that Fox News is the real enemy and he needs to be taken off the air.
[00:35:48.812 --> 00:35:57.854]  And then he goes on to talk about how the right wing is exploiting our freedoms and creating divisions and rifts.
[00:35:57.854 --> 00:36:00.234]  I don't have time to play the whole podcast.
[00:36:00.234 --> 00:36:02.735]  I watched most of it last night.
[00:36:02.735 --> 00:36:03.975]  It's like 45 minutes long.
[00:36:05.518 --> 00:36:09.439]  And it's the left openly opening wounds and rubbing salt in them and exploiting.
[00:36:09.439 --> 00:36:10.239]  We all know that.
[00:36:10.239 --> 00:36:12.359]  Anybody can see that.
[00:36:12.359 --> 00:36:13.340]  They're doing 95% of it.
[00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:19.801]  The only thing Republicans are really bad on is warmongering.
[00:36:19.801 --> 00:36:21.021]  But you look at the left, man.
[00:36:21.021 --> 00:36:30.423]  Pedophilia, just open borders, everything bad, creating total division, brainwashing little white kids that are inherently bad because of their skin color.
[00:36:30.423 --> 00:36:30.983]  I mean, wow.
[00:36:32.677 --> 00:36:34.258]  Those kids are going to be screwed up for life.
[00:36:34.258 --> 00:36:39.342]  And this is going on to purge our military, to purge everything, to divide and conquer.
[00:36:40.433 --> 00:36:46.376]  I know I'm the most evil guy in the world because I questioned Sandy Hook and then they hired a PR firm after Trump got elected and hyped it up.
[00:36:46.376 --> 00:36:54.219]  I was doing things to them I didn't ever do and then had judges find me guilty and told juries I was guilty and I would be found guilty and then, oh, you owe billions of dollars.
[00:36:54.219 --> 00:36:57.221]  You know, we don't have, we don't have millions of dollars.
[00:36:57.221 --> 00:37:01.363]  This is how the system operates with its branding and its deception.
[00:37:01.363 --> 00:37:04.004]  So they're branding whites as all evil and racist that need to be attacked.
[00:37:05.154 --> 00:37:12.640]  And then blacks start attacking whites, and then the left sits back to referee it all, like a warden in a prison, where they control people through the different racial groups.
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:21.306]  That's all this is, is prison management systems of racial gangs, or the gangs of New York, being projected over the whole world.
[00:37:21.306 --> 00:37:22.047]  It's being done everywhere.
[00:37:22.047 --> 00:37:25.970]  They use Muslims in Europe to do it.
[00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:26.650]  It's very real.
[00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:30.573]  The Muslims are coming to rape and kill you, and they do it all the time, and it's defended and protected.
[00:37:30.573 --> 00:37:31.794]  But who's behind it?
[00:37:32.509 --> 00:37:34.450]  The Jon Stewart's of the world.
[00:37:34.450 --> 00:37:37.012]  Jon Stewart's a nasty person.
[00:37:37.012 --> 00:37:39.935]  He knows exactly what he's doing.
[00:37:39.935 --> 00:37:43.037]  He picks a few charities that look good and care about 9-11 and the dust.
[00:37:43.037 --> 00:37:46.439]  He's worried about the bombs in the buildings, Jon.
[00:37:46.439 --> 00:37:49.842]  He knows damn well about it.
[00:37:49.842 --> 00:37:51.723]  So he can be up there on this big moral high ground.
[00:37:51.723 --> 00:37:56.047]  Because everything he says about me is him.
[00:37:56.047 --> 00:37:56.387]  Here it is.
[00:37:57.555 --> 00:38:12.165]  A piece of what might concern us about the sort of ingrained nature of these media models is that do we get to a place in which the outcome of defamation laws can't
[00:38:12.685 --> 00:38:15.488]  Can't serve that remedial purpose that we described.
[00:38:15.488 --> 00:38:35.205]  So one place in which I've been following this closely in the last six months or so is Alex Jones, who has also been involved in a prominent defamation suit involving Sandy Hook parents, suggesting that they were sort of paid actors who pretended that their children had been the victims of mass murder.
[00:38:35.205 --> 00:38:37.346]  And the, you know, we have
[00:38:38.007 --> 00:38:43.251]  Alex Jones is a far less pernicious influence on this country than Fox News.
[00:38:43.251 --> 00:38:43.491]  By far.
[00:39:07.209 --> 00:39:09.031]  Uh, people know what that cat is.
[00:39:09.031 --> 00:39:15.256]  Uh, you know, they, they know if it looks like a duck, sounds like a duck walks like, like they know what that is.
[00:39:15.256 --> 00:39:16.898]  Now that doesn't mean he doesn't have influence.
[00:39:16.898 --> 00:39:19.320]  And that doesn't mean that he didn't defame those parents.
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:20.601]  Cause he did.
[00:39:20.601 --> 00:39:25.926]  And he caused them grave damage, but as a cultural, uh, pathogen.
[00:39:26.934 --> 00:39:36.662]  Fox News is far more powerful, far more devious, far more pernicious, and has created far more damage than Alex Jones ever will.
[00:39:36.662 --> 00:39:42.427]  And at least Alex Jones gives you supplements to help offset the damage.
[00:39:42.427 --> 00:39:45.029]  I mean, that's the, that's the beautiful part about what he does.
[00:39:45.029 --> 00:39:49.432]  Now, if Fox would give you supplements, perhaps that would be, uh, but do you understand what I'm saying?
[00:39:49.432 --> 00:39:54.837]  They are, there is no way Alex Jones is, is a wolf in wolf's clothing.
[00:39:56.624 --> 00:40:01.107]  Fox News is the opposite.
[00:40:01.107 --> 00:40:08.132]  Hey, uh, Jon Stewart, two judges found me guilty because they didn't have any evidence of what they were claiming.
[00:40:08.132 --> 00:40:10.153]  That I sent people to pee on their graves?
[00:40:10.153 --> 00:40:11.815]  I mean, come on!
[00:40:11.815 --> 00:40:12.455]  Where's the clip?
[00:40:12.455 --> 00:40:13.036]  Where'd I do that?
[00:40:13.036 --> 00:40:13.716]  Didn't ever do it!
[00:40:13.716 --> 00:40:16.478]  There was a big debate on the internet about whether it happened or not.
[00:40:16.478 --> 00:40:19.460]  I joined in on it, gave my opinion.
[00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:23.483]  And I was the test subject, patient zero.
[00:40:24.505 --> 00:40:24.885]  For this.
[00:40:24.885 --> 00:40:30.150]  And notice John Stewart just talked about the pathogen, the disease of Alex Jones.
[00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:31.811]  The virus.
[00:40:31.811 --> 00:40:33.192]  What did Hitler call Jews?
[00:40:33.192 --> 00:40:34.473]  He called them viruses.
[00:40:34.473 --> 00:40:37.776]  He called them infections.
[00:40:37.776 --> 00:40:41.379]  Who's talking Hitler talk, Mr. Stewart?
[00:40:41.379 --> 00:40:45.062]  You know damn well what you're doing, mister.
[00:40:45.062 --> 00:40:47.824]  And shame on you.
[00:40:47.824 --> 00:40:48.625]  Let's play another clip.
[00:40:48.625 --> 00:40:53.568]  Here's John Stewart talking about the right exploiting riff.
[00:40:53.568 --> 00:40:53.949]  Here it is.
[00:40:55.084 --> 00:41:01.686]  Not acting as a reasonable journalistic outlet isn't a high enough, it doesn't reach the standard.
[00:41:01.686 --> 00:41:07.367]  You can engage in sloppy journalism and not meet the actual malice standard.
[00:41:07.367 --> 00:41:15.289]  Rather, you have to get to a place where there's this clear and convincing evidence that you had knowing falsity.
[00:41:15.289 --> 00:41:21.390]  Do you think that this is a case of an organization, a propaganda arm of a political movement,
[00:41:22.151 --> 00:41:27.257]  Knowingly exploiting, you know, in some ways it's, it's, they hate our freedoms.
[00:41:27.257 --> 00:41:33.664]  And so they're going to exploit the cracks in a system that believes in the first amendment.
[00:41:33.664 --> 00:41:40.811]  They're going to exploit that and leverage that to gain their own political power.
[00:41:40.811 --> 00:41:43.054]  Aren't they gaming a system?
[00:41:43.664 --> 00:41:44.625]  Okay, that's enough.
[00:41:44.625 --> 00:41:45.926]  I don't have time to play the whole clip.
[00:41:45.926 --> 00:41:50.050]  It's on InfoWars.com, but here's an article on InfoWars.com with video clips.
[00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:50.870]  There's a whole bunch of them.
[00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:51.071]  The U.N.
[00:41:51.071 --> 00:41:57.396]  is saying they're already running censorship, and now they're going to control Twitter and maybe indict Elon Musk for free speech.
[00:41:57.396 --> 00:41:58.177]  The U.N.
[00:41:58.177 --> 00:42:02.560]  says that censoring disinformation and hate speech will protect free speech.
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:05.983]  You just heard Stewart say that.
[00:42:05.983 --> 00:42:08.125]  He's going to decide what you can say.
[00:42:08.125 --> 00:42:10.988]  He's going to decide what you can do, because God forbid
[00:42:11.952 --> 00:42:15.936]  You actually come listen to the show and hear what I really have to say?
[00:42:15.936 --> 00:42:17.257]  No, no, no, no.
[00:42:17.257 --> 00:42:28.549]  I've got to be silenced so they can then put in my mouth whatever words they want and you'll never know that I didn't really say them.
[00:42:28.549 --> 00:42:29.530]  They're the bad guys.
[00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:31.051]  They're the establishment.
[00:42:31.051 --> 00:42:31.672]  They're the elite.
[00:42:31.672 --> 00:42:32.633]  They're playing us like a fiddle.
[00:42:33.587 --> 00:42:36.910]  And it's time to realize the New World Order is starting World War III.
[00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:39.071]  The New World Order is trying to take over your body.
[00:42:39.071 --> 00:42:41.854]  The globalists are trying to take over your children, and they are.
[00:42:41.854 --> 00:42:42.995]  They're the problem.
[00:42:42.995 --> 00:42:43.635]  They're the enemy.
[00:42:43.635 --> 00:42:48.639]  Hollywood, the media, the globalists, they're the enemy, and they know they're our enemy.
[00:42:48.639 --> 00:42:50.841]  They hate you and your family.
[00:42:50.841 --> 00:42:51.942]  I want to control your body.
[00:43:00.836 --> 00:43:09.042]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic book that documents the globalists, in their own words, plan for our future.
[00:43:09.042 --> 00:43:10.503]  That is a hellish future.
[00:43:10.503 --> 00:43:19.909]  Now, you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess, they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or Infowarsware.com.
[00:43:19.909 --> 00:43:25.493]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[00:43:25.493 --> 00:43:27.475]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[00:43:28.075 --> 00:43:33.437]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy, at InfoWarsHore.com.
[00:43:33.437 --> 00:43:37.378]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[00:43:37.378 --> 00:43:43.260]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you help keep InfoWars on the air.
[00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:45.361]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book.
[00:43:46.141 --> 00:43:47.203]  Or unsigned copies.
[00:43:47.203 --> 00:43:57.556]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to infowarshore.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library or give them to the local school.
[00:43:57.556 --> 00:43:58.618]  This is an InfoWar.
[00:43:58.618 --> 00:44:00.240]  I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[00:44:00.831 --> 00:44:04.997]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[00:44:04.997 --> 00:44:08.722]  A flying disc has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[00:44:08.722 --> 00:44:11.105]  There is a bulletin from PBS News.
[00:44:11.105 --> 00:44:12.788]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[00:44:12.788 --> 00:44:16.032]  This is a different kind of war.
[00:44:16.833 --> 00:44:21.555]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[00:44:21.555 --> 00:44:24.677]  A CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[00:44:24.677 --> 00:44:28.738]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[00:44:28.738 --> 00:44:31.199]  It was almost as if it were a plan imposed.
[00:44:31.199 --> 00:44:32.120]  It just happened.
[00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:36.623]  We need to go into the Capitol!
[00:44:36.623 --> 00:44:38.745]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[00:44:38.745 --> 00:44:40.366]  They are nothing but distraction.
[00:44:40.366 --> 00:44:43.729]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[00:44:43.729 --> 00:44:45.070]  You silenced those voices.
[00:44:45.070 --> 00:44:48.833]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[00:44:48.833 --> 00:44:55.258]  Soon as we start exposing the Great Reset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison!
[00:45:00.871 --> 00:45:04.894]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[00:45:04.894 --> 00:45:08.756]  A flying disc has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[00:45:08.756 --> 00:45:11.158]  Here is a bulletin from CBS News.
[00:45:11.158 --> 00:45:13.539]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[00:45:13.539 --> 00:45:16.081]  This is a different kind of war.
[00:45:16.861 --> 00:45:21.344]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[00:45:21.344 --> 00:45:24.746]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[00:45:24.746 --> 00:45:28.788]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[00:45:28.788 --> 00:45:30.729]  It was almost as if it were a plan in full.
[00:45:30.729 --> 00:45:31.550]  It just can't end.
[00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:34.011]  We need to go into the capital!
[00:45:34.011 --> 00:45:34.632]  That's it!
[00:45:36.673 --> 00:45:38.795]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[00:45:38.795 --> 00:45:40.437]  They are nothing but distraction.
[00:45:40.437 --> 00:45:42.639]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[00:45:42.639 --> 00:45:45.101]  You silenced those voices.
[00:45:45.101 --> 00:45:48.865]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[00:45:48.865 --> 00:45:55.291]  Soon as we start exposing the Great Reset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison!
[00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:02.561]  I've got some good news.
[00:46:02.561 --> 00:46:09.446]  Our high-quality supplements really work, and we have about an 80% reorder rate with customers.
[00:46:09.446 --> 00:46:10.267]  That's the good news.
[00:46:10.267 --> 00:46:11.408]  They're amazing.
[00:46:11.408 --> 00:46:19.593]  The bad news is, around 1% or a little less of our actual viewers and listeners ever go to InfoWareStore.com and ever actually buy the products.
[00:46:19.593 --> 00:46:23.036]  So you're missing out on these products, plus it funds the InfoWare.
[00:46:23.036 --> 00:46:27.959]  Think of what we've done with just 1% of our massive audience actually buying products.
[00:46:27.959 --> 00:46:28.800]  Think what would happen.
[00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:43.249]  If those of you on the fence actually went to InfoWarStore.com and got some of these amazing products, I would recommend Turmeric 95 for your joints, your bones, inflammation, to get one of the biggest effects, so you reorder it and see how great it is.
[00:46:43.249 --> 00:46:52.215]  Also, we've got the super high-quality, full-spectrum CBD oil that's so good for your neurological systems, your brain, your joints, your bones, as well.
[00:46:52.215 --> 00:46:53.596]  Or Real Red Pill Plus.
[00:46:53.596 --> 00:46:58.019]  Just go try the product, fund the InfoWar, and help us defeat the New World Order together.
[00:46:58.019 --> 00:46:59.340]  InfoWarStore.com.
[00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:00.161]  I think so.
[00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:33.191]  Final segment of hour one on this Friday Transmission.
[00:47:33.191 --> 00:47:35.052]  I'll be back Sunday live 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:47:35.052 --> 00:47:38.513]  Don't forget that.
[00:47:38.513 --> 00:47:40.853]  All right.
[00:47:40.853 --> 00:47:53.656]  I want to read to you a headline because I had Michael Yan in studios, a really famous military man and reporter, and I was telling him in studio, hey,
[00:47:54.921 --> 00:48:00.663]  Two years ago, they went next level banning me and Facebook said 12 people are allowed to be physically attacked.
[00:48:00.663 --> 00:48:08.384]  12 people, you're allowed to call for violence against them, which is racketeering and totally illegal on every front.
[00:48:08.384 --> 00:48:10.025]  And he just couldn't believe it.
[00:48:10.025 --> 00:48:11.545]  And I get why he couldn't believe it.
[00:48:11.545 --> 00:48:21.628]  I couldn't believe when the official terms of Facebook two and a half years ago said Louis Faircon, Alex Jones, Paul Joseph Watson, Laura Loomer, Milo Yiannopoulos,
[00:48:24.392 --> 00:48:26.073]  And a few others.
[00:48:26.073 --> 00:48:28.395]  You're allowed to call for violence against them.
[00:48:28.395 --> 00:48:31.398]  Instead, you're not allowed to say anything positive about them.
[00:48:31.398 --> 00:48:35.821]  That was already in the previous rules from four years ago.
[00:48:35.821 --> 00:48:40.164]  But when we call someone a dangerous individual, you're allowed to call for violence against them.
[00:48:40.164 --> 00:48:43.867]  So I thought I'd actually show you the document.
[00:48:43.867 --> 00:48:45.829]  Because these are the types of things that happen.
[00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:51.413]  Like, I was in the bankruptcy hearing yesterday with the Justice Department.
[00:48:51.413 --> 00:48:52.474]  They wanted to interview me.
[00:48:54.352 --> 00:48:56.533]  It went about three hours.
[00:48:56.533 --> 00:49:03.476]  And when they said, we want to know about your cat, what's the value of your cat, we might want your cat, that didn't seem real.
[00:49:03.476 --> 00:49:05.417]  It was an audio meeting.
[00:49:05.417 --> 00:49:09.039]  I'm going to try to get that audio because you made the point it's a public record.
[00:49:09.039 --> 00:49:13.561]  Well, they were putting out all my private information.
[00:49:13.561 --> 00:49:14.762]  So last night I shot a video.
[00:49:14.762 --> 00:49:15.502]  I don't have a Twitter account.
[00:49:15.502 --> 00:49:16.023]  My wife does.
[00:49:16.023 --> 00:49:17.483]  You know, responding to this, it's gone viral.
[00:49:17.483 --> 00:49:18.264]  It's all over the news.
[00:49:18.264 --> 00:49:19.985]  They're misrepresenting.
[00:49:19.985 --> 00:49:21.985]  Oh, Jones transferred millions to his family last year.
[00:49:21.985 --> 00:49:22.846]  Just totally made up.
[00:49:24.386 --> 00:49:26.047]  Just completely made up.
[00:49:26.047 --> 00:49:26.828]  Just a total lie.
[00:49:26.828 --> 00:49:27.269]  Doesn't matter.
[00:49:27.269 --> 00:49:28.430]  Just say it.
[00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:35.376]  Jones got all this money.
[00:49:35.376 --> 00:49:43.142]  My wife, in her prenup, after being married five years, it says in the prenup that she gets half the house.
[00:49:43.142 --> 00:49:47.046]  Well, her lawyer noticed that we'd already been married almost seven years, a year ago, six years.
[00:49:47.938 --> 00:49:51.741]  And said, oh, we need to file that you're co-owner of the house.
[00:49:51.741 --> 00:49:52.462]  And they filed that.
[00:49:52.462 --> 00:49:53.783]  That's the transfer.
[00:49:53.783 --> 00:49:55.004]  It's my homestead.
[00:49:55.004 --> 00:49:57.666]  We're not hiding assets.
[00:49:57.666 --> 00:50:01.249]  But that's how they make stuff up.
[00:50:01.249 --> 00:50:02.150]  That's how they make it.
[00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:06.353]  Ooh, look, Jones says they want his cat, but really, he's hiding money.
[00:50:06.353 --> 00:50:08.475]  It's all games to manipulate you.
[00:50:09.522 --> 00:50:10.283]  This is bigger than me.
[00:50:10.283 --> 00:50:11.524]  I'm not up here talking about myself right now.
[00:50:11.524 --> 00:50:12.785]  I'm talking about all of us.
[00:50:12.785 --> 00:50:13.846]  Look at these headlines.
[00:50:13.846 --> 00:50:20.431]  Facebook post that deletes rules allowing calls to violence against dangerous individuals.
[00:50:20.431 --> 00:50:23.914]  There were a lot of articles written about it in 2019.
[00:50:23.914 --> 00:50:29.459]  And there's screenshots of it here.
[00:50:29.459 --> 00:50:30.279]  LifeSite News.
[00:50:30.279 --> 00:50:33.422]  Others picked it up.
[00:50:33.422 --> 00:50:35.384]  And it says you're allowed to call for violence against them.
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:37.280]  Go read it for yourself.
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:39.761]  Paul Watson wrote about it in Summit.News.
[00:50:39.761 --> 00:50:43.542]  Facebook deletes policy allowing violent threats against dangerous individuals.
[00:50:43.542 --> 00:50:49.943]  They actually floated organizing violent people to come after us.
[00:50:49.943 --> 00:50:51.103]  You know, they don't just silence you.
[00:50:51.103 --> 00:50:52.884]  Then they try to organize people to come after you.
[00:50:52.884 --> 00:50:55.765]  Well, that sounds pretty communist or pretty Nazi.
[00:50:55.765 --> 00:50:59.085]  What it sounds like is flaming totalitarianism.
[00:50:59.085 --> 00:50:59.725]  But that's what they do.
[00:50:59.725 --> 00:51:01.746]  So let's talk about the cat.
[00:51:02.489 --> 00:51:05.250]  You know, the media all says, oh, we called Jones, didn't get a comment.
[00:51:05.250 --> 00:51:08.031]  Really, I shot this at like 8 o'clock last night.
[00:51:08.031 --> 00:51:10.292]  Didn't see your calls, didn't hear them.
[00:51:10.292 --> 00:51:13.013]  We can't confirm this really happened.
[00:51:13.013 --> 00:51:15.533]  You know Jones, he makes stuff up.
[00:51:15.533 --> 00:51:17.314]  The memes are everywhere, come and take it.
[00:51:17.314 --> 00:51:20.815]  It's a gift to my five-year-old daughter when she was three.
[00:51:20.815 --> 00:51:21.796]  She wanted a cat.
[00:51:21.796 --> 00:51:23.556]  I'm not a big cat person.
[00:51:23.556 --> 00:51:25.977]  So I googled smartest cats.
[00:51:25.977 --> 00:51:27.077]  I didn't want a fancy cat.
[00:51:27.077 --> 00:51:28.318]  I didn't want to... I wanted to know...
[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:31.942]  Smartest cats or cat most like a dog.
[00:51:31.942 --> 00:51:37.367]  And that was a... Ragdoll.
[00:51:37.367 --> 00:51:39.869]  And folks, anybody that knows anything's got a ragdoll.
[00:51:39.869 --> 00:51:44.293]  My God, I'll have ragdolls the rest of my life.
[00:51:44.293 --> 00:51:48.337]  This cat is like a rocket scientist.
[00:51:48.337 --> 00:51:53.361]  The cat, without ever being trained, pees in the toilet.
[00:51:53.361 --> 00:51:54.522]  Oh yeah.
[00:51:54.522 --> 00:51:56.284]  The cat fetches balls.
[00:52:01.778 --> 00:52:03.178]  And yeah, we paid two grand for the cat.
[00:52:03.178 --> 00:52:04.619]  It is a fancy cat.
[00:52:04.619 --> 00:52:06.619]  And boy, worth every penny.
[00:52:06.619 --> 00:52:08.559]  I've always been a mutt guy.
[00:52:08.559 --> 00:52:12.200]  Had cats growing up that were like, you know, tabbies and cat, you know.
[00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:18.321]  There'd be some cat kittens running around under the house and you'd, you know, take some to the pound and keep one of them.
[00:52:18.321 --> 00:52:22.242]  That was the cats my mom had growing up.
[00:52:22.242 --> 00:52:24.062]  Not in the same league.
[00:52:24.062 --> 00:52:30.423]  But I'm in this meeting and they say, well, tell us about the cat, how fancy it is, how much it's worth, you know, blah, blah, blah.
[00:52:32.276 --> 00:52:33.457]  Who owns the cat?
[00:52:33.457 --> 00:52:35.918]  The cat's a gift, my daughter.
[00:52:35.918 --> 00:52:37.478]  But the point is, it's just a mess with me.
[00:52:37.478 --> 00:52:42.800]  I had several lawyers on the meeting, and their combined 50 years of practice, they never heard anything like this.
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:44.301]  It's not like it's a racehorse or something.
[00:52:44.301 --> 00:52:47.142]  It's a member of the family.
[00:52:47.142 --> 00:52:48.103]  They moosh you.
[00:52:48.103 --> 00:52:51.904]  My daughter named it.
[00:52:51.904 --> 00:52:56.006]  My nickname for the cat is Worm, because it'll just roll around on its back for hours.
[00:52:56.006 --> 00:52:58.727]  It looked pretty worm-like there in my arms.
[00:52:58.727 --> 00:52:59.827]  And the cat loves me.
[00:52:59.827 --> 00:53:00.688]  I'm the favorite.
[00:53:00.688 --> 00:53:01.208]  There's no doubt.
[00:53:02.358 --> 00:53:05.639]  Cat jumps in my lap all the time and makes biscuits, you know.
[00:53:05.639 --> 00:53:09.120]  But he jumped out of my hands last night because I was talking so loud.
[00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:11.281]  He didn't like that.
[00:53:11.281 --> 00:53:14.042]  But usually I can't keep the cat out of my lap.
[00:53:14.042 --> 00:53:19.263]  But the point is, is that that's how these people operate.
[00:53:19.263 --> 00:53:21.204]  And I'm not saying the Sandy Hook families want my cat.
[00:53:21.204 --> 00:53:22.184]  It was just the U.S.
[00:53:22.184 --> 00:53:26.325]  Attorney General's Office, Justice Department lawyer laughing.
[00:53:26.325 --> 00:53:28.006]  There were people who were giggling in the background.
[00:53:28.006 --> 00:53:31.827]  And they just spin the whole thing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:34.415 --> 00:53:40.499]  So that's where we are as a culture is a weaponized Justice Department.
[00:53:40.499 --> 00:53:44.302]  And the Justice Department is so scared right now.
[00:53:44.302 --> 00:53:45.743]  Chuckie Schumer's freaking out.
[00:53:45.743 --> 00:53:47.044]  Schiff's freaking out.
[00:53:47.044 --> 00:53:50.826]  They're like, oh my God, don't look at the footage from the Capitol.
[00:53:50.826 --> 00:53:54.349]  They say it's a national security threat.
[00:53:54.349 --> 00:53:57.811]  And it does turn out that the Justice Department has erased thousands of hours.
[00:53:57.811 --> 00:54:00.013]  So Tucker Carlson is not being given.
[00:54:01.826 --> 00:54:02.566]  Full access.
[00:54:02.566 --> 00:54:06.468]  I talked to lawyers involved in the case last night.
[00:54:06.468 --> 00:54:07.429]  So that's a big problem.
[00:54:07.429 --> 00:54:08.729]  We're not getting the full footage.
[00:54:08.729 --> 00:54:12.271]  I think it should just be given out human source like WikiLeaks.
[00:54:12.271 --> 00:54:14.492]  That's the only way.
[00:54:14.492 --> 00:54:14.612]  41,000.
[00:54:14.612 --> 00:54:17.293]  Remember it was 44,000.
[00:54:17.293 --> 00:54:17.333]  43,000.
[00:54:17.333 --> 00:54:18.634]  Now it's 40, 41,000.
[00:54:18.634 --> 00:54:20.214]  Thousands of hours have been taken.
[00:54:20.214 --> 00:54:26.157]  Schumer calls McCartney giving January 6th tapes to Tucker Carlson, one of the worst security risks since 9-11.
[00:54:26.157 --> 00:54:26.477]  Really?
[00:54:32.642 --> 00:54:38.805]  The security risk is only 19% of Americans have confidence in Biden's handling of the war or support the war.
[00:54:38.805 --> 00:54:39.466]  I tell you, it's about 80%.
[00:54:39.466 --> 00:54:43.307]  On average, there's another poll.
[00:54:43.307 --> 00:54:45.028]  80% against, that's 81%.
[00:54:45.028 --> 00:54:47.089]  Ahead of possible Chinese invasion, the U.S.
[00:54:47.089 --> 00:54:49.231]  prepares to increase troops in Taiwan.
[00:54:49.231 --> 00:54:50.311]  That's a threat to all of us.
[00:54:50.311 --> 00:54:54.693]  This is all completely out of control, but it's okay.
[00:54:54.693 --> 00:54:56.134]  Meanwhile, Joy Behard.
[00:54:56.134 --> 00:54:59.316]  I don't have time to play the clip.
[00:54:59.316 --> 00:55:00.696]  I don't want to hear her voice.
[00:55:00.696 --> 00:55:01.697]  Hell, I've had the bad...
[00:55:05.157 --> 00:55:17.581]  Fate to actually be on The View in close proximity to these harpies, but The View turns pure evil with disgusting attack on residents of East Palestine saying they deserve it because Pennsylvania voted for Trump.
[00:55:17.581 --> 00:55:18.841]  What the hell does that mean?
[00:55:18.841 --> 00:55:19.521]  Wow.
[00:55:19.521 --> 00:55:31.085]  The cold-blooded nastiness of all these harpies with the children in that area and surrounding areas with deadly dioxin that'll give you really bad cancer really quickly.
[00:55:31.085 --> 00:55:31.845]  Raining down on them.
[00:55:33.843 --> 00:55:42.426]  And these pro-World War III, pro-censorship harpies think it's their fault.
[00:55:42.426 --> 00:55:46.148]  Town Hall started the investigation and now it turns out it is a giant pedophile ring.
[00:55:46.148 --> 00:55:47.749]  It's all coming out.
[00:55:47.749 --> 00:55:54.711]  Investigation have might just uncovered the origins of the LBGTQ pedophile ring.
[00:55:54.711 --> 00:55:59.753]  Getting adopted children from Christian parents where it was taken by CPS to be rape ganged.
[00:55:59.753 --> 00:56:01.154]  Well, that's the official CIA program.
[00:56:01.929 --> 00:56:06.432]  Billionaire Thomas Lee in front of the Clintons found dead from apparent suicide, Arkansas.
[00:56:06.432 --> 00:56:10.674]  And it goes on from there.
[00:56:10.674 --> 00:56:11.895]  We're going to start the next hour.
[00:56:11.895 --> 00:56:15.077]  We're going to cover a ton of news and information.
[00:56:15.077 --> 00:56:18.159]  That's a big guest that we'll be telling you about coming up.
[00:56:18.159 --> 00:56:21.361]  Please remember, I can't battle the deep state and the new world order without your help.
[00:56:22.401 --> 00:56:23.522]  They want to silence me.
[00:56:23.522 --> 00:56:24.382]  They want to silence you.
[00:56:24.382 --> 00:56:25.163]  So share the article.
[00:56:25.163 --> 00:56:27.745]  Share the videos at Band.Video and InfoWars.com.
[00:56:27.745 --> 00:56:31.447]  Use the URL ConspiracyFact.info to share just a live feed that gets around the censors.
[00:56:31.447 --> 00:56:32.488]  They'll probably ban that link soon.
[00:56:32.488 --> 00:56:33.328]  We'll have a new URL.
[00:56:33.328 --> 00:56:35.350]  ConspiracyFact.info.
[00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:40.073]  And get great products at InfoWars.com that really will enrich your life no matter what color you are.
[00:56:41.403 --> 00:56:42.925]  You should get the Ultimate Bone Broth.
[00:56:42.925 --> 00:56:46.668]  You really should get our high quality CBD oil.
[00:56:46.668 --> 00:56:48.130]  You really should get our Turmeric 95.
[00:56:48.130 --> 00:56:50.512]  It's the same as Body's 95 or 6 Humanoid.
[00:56:50.512 --> 00:56:51.453]  Super high quality.
[00:56:51.453 --> 00:56:57.599]  You really should get the prebiotic fiber that's been sold out for over a year, that's finally back in stock.
[00:56:57.599 --> 00:56:58.720]  The Ultimate Bone Broth.
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:56:59.300]  It's all there.
[00:56:59.300 --> 00:57:00.602]  Infowars store.
[00:57:01.768 --> 00:57:04.390]  .com or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:04.390 --> 00:57:08.913]  The last copies of The Great Reset and War of the World that are signed copies are available.
[00:57:08.913 --> 00:57:12.755]  You'll always, I guess because there's a nuclear war you won't be able to, but get an unsigned copy.
[00:57:12.755 --> 00:57:14.576]  They're both signed and unsigned copies.
[00:57:14.576 --> 00:57:15.937]  The signed copies are a fundraiser.
[00:57:15.937 --> 00:57:17.238]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten them.
[00:57:17.238 --> 00:57:25.864]  I want to encourage those of you that want to get a historical memento, a piece of history, buzzer number one bestseller for months, to get a signed copy at Infowarstore.com.
[00:57:27.779 --> 00:57:31.143]  Or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:31.143 --> 00:57:36.530]  And t-shirts will soon be back in the store, and a lot of other exciting news as well.
[00:57:36.530 --> 00:57:41.336]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, hour number two, three, and four are coming up.
[00:57:41.336 --> 00:57:47.123]  I probably should have told you about the big guest, because they are big, big, big.
[00:57:47.123 --> 00:57:47.263]  Yep.
[00:57:48.041 --> 00:57:49.483]  Chris Skyes, Skiles, and so much more.
[00:58:09.145 --> 00:58:14.747]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[00:58:14.747 --> 00:58:17.328]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[00:58:17.328 --> 00:58:22.709]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy, at InfoWarsHore.com.
[00:58:22.709 --> 00:58:26.650]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[00:58:26.650 --> 00:58:32.532]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you help keep InfoWars on the air.
[00:58:32.532 --> 00:58:34.613]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book.
[00:58:35.393 --> 00:58:36.453]  Or unsigned copies.
[00:58:36.453 --> 00:58:46.817]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowarshore.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library or give them to the local school.
[00:58:46.817 --> 00:58:47.857]  This is an Infowar.
[00:58:47.857 --> 00:58:49.478]  I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[00:58:51.852 --> 00:58:58.256]  It's hard to believe that we're already going into March 2023, and the world is an insane place.
[00:58:58.256 --> 00:58:59.997]  World War III has already started.
[00:58:59.997 --> 00:59:02.319]  Biden is a puppet and is dissolving our borders.
[00:59:02.319 --> 00:59:03.479]  There's mass censorship.
[00:59:03.479 --> 00:59:05.701]  James O'Keefe's been removed from Project Veritas.
[00:59:05.701 --> 00:59:07.962]  The list goes on and on of the bad things that are happening.
[00:59:07.962 --> 00:59:12.425]  But the good things that are happening is humanity is really accelerating its awakening.
[00:59:12.605 --> 00:59:16.548]  But those of us on the forefront are under more attack by the establishment than ever.
[00:59:16.548 --> 00:59:24.954]  That's why I'm counting on you to spread the word about the broadcast, to pray for the broadcast, and to keep the broadcast on the air by getting great products at Infowarshore.com.
[00:59:24.954 --> 00:59:33.621]  And whether it's a final signed copy, they're almost all sold out, or the Great Reset and War for the World, or Ultimate Bone Broth, finally back in stock after over two years, it's all available at Infowarshore.com.
[00:59:33.621 --> 00:59:35.242]  These are truly amazing products.

[00:59:41.588 --> 00:59:46.192]  It is your decision on whether or not we stay on air, so please take action now at InfoWarsStore.
[01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:21.933]  Now it's always an honor to be filling in for Alex, as it is once again today.
[01:00:21.933 --> 01:00:25.934]  And I've got a couple great guests I'm going to be speaking with.
[01:00:25.934 --> 01:00:31.636]  Joel Skalzin will talk about the Ukraine situation, what it would mean, World War III, the fallout,
[01:00:32.594 --> 01:00:40.820]  And of course, being an expert in emergency preparedness and geo-strategy, if you will, in disasters.
[01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:53.029]  And then Chris Sky, who's just like channeling the future of the tyranny, of the medical tyranny, and the world government just so eloquently.
[01:00:53.029 --> 01:00:55.351]  So many predictions, obviously, coming true.
[01:00:56.741 --> 01:01:00.385]  He's like the Canadian Alex Jones in a muscle tee.
[01:01:00.385 --> 01:01:03.708]  And he'll be joining us as well.
[01:01:03.708 --> 01:01:05.209]  And so that's all coming up.
[01:01:05.209 --> 01:01:07.732]  But, you know, I gotta tell you something, folks.
[01:01:07.732 --> 01:01:16.180]  With all the news, and you know me, you listen to InfoWars, I'm big into the news, I obsess over the news, I try to focus on the real things.
[01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:19.203]  But there's a story today that really is tugging at my heartstrings.
[01:01:22.304 --> 01:01:24.569]  I don't think Alex actually played the video.
[01:01:24.569 --> 01:01:26.333]  Did he actually play the video of the cat?
[01:01:27.290 --> 01:01:29.672]  I want to play this video.
[01:01:29.672 --> 01:01:32.634]  Alex Jones going through the legal issues.
[01:01:32.634 --> 01:01:34.956]  And of course they tried to take a trillion dollars from him.
[01:01:34.956 --> 01:01:36.578]  Literally they asked for a trillion dollars.
[01:01:36.578 --> 01:01:39.400]  The number ended up being billions.
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:42.262]  But it's not enough just to take all the man's money.
[01:01:42.262 --> 01:01:44.104]  They want to go after his pets.
[01:01:44.104 --> 01:01:47.567]  They want to bring his pets into this as well as children's pets.
[01:01:47.567 --> 01:01:53.892]  So this was an update yesterday from Alex Jones from a bankruptcy hearing.
[01:01:55.086 --> 01:02:01.009]  Where his furry little friend there, his daughter's first pet, is now coming into the litigation.
[01:02:01.009 --> 01:02:03.810]  Here it is.
[01:02:03.810 --> 01:02:06.652]  Okay, so this is not a joke.
[01:02:06.652 --> 01:02:07.472]  This is real.
[01:02:07.472 --> 01:02:09.093]  And it's really happened.
[01:02:09.093 --> 01:02:11.094]  And I just got home tonight with my family.
[01:02:11.094 --> 01:02:14.276]  It's my wife shooting this video.
[01:02:14.276 --> 01:02:18.358]  I'm in a bankruptcy hearing, personal and corporate for Infowars.
[01:02:19.535 --> 01:02:26.701]  And the Justice Department is involved and asked me to be, ordered me to be at a hearing today.
[01:02:26.701 --> 01:02:33.808]  And they spent probably five minutes of the meeting, it was over three hours long, on my cat.
[01:02:33.808 --> 01:02:38.051]  This is Mushu, my five-year-old daughter named Mushu, this two years ago.
[01:02:38.051 --> 01:02:40.373]  And they wanted to know if assets were hidden in the cat.
[01:02:40.373 --> 01:02:41.094]  The cat was like $2,000.
[01:02:42.961 --> 01:02:45.702]  And it is a ragdoll cat and we really do love it.
[01:02:45.702 --> 01:02:53.984]  But they were very serious about the cat and its value and they may want the cat for the Sandy Hook families.
[01:02:53.984 --> 01:02:56.724]  So the deal's broke.
[01:02:56.724 --> 01:02:59.085]  You guys aren't getting the cat.
[01:02:59.085 --> 01:03:00.165]  This is next level.
[01:03:00.165 --> 01:03:01.746]  This is harassment.
[01:03:01.746 --> 01:03:02.746]  No one's ever heard of this.
[01:03:02.746 --> 01:03:05.587]  My lawyer's never heard of this.
[01:03:05.587 --> 01:03:06.587]  This is just insane.
[01:03:07.899 --> 01:03:11.040]  And I mean, what do you want my children next?
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:13.621]  Do you want to like sacrifice my children or something?
[01:03:13.621 --> 01:03:15.562]  So, so this cat is really sweet.
[01:03:15.562 --> 01:03:17.722]  My daughter really likes the cat.
[01:03:17.722 --> 01:03:20.583]  He's a little bit tired of me holding him, but I mean, here he is.
[01:03:20.583 --> 01:03:25.285]  This is, this is, this is the terrorist right here that they want.
[01:03:25.285 --> 01:03:30.146]  And this is the reality that we live in here in America in 2023.
[01:03:30.146 --> 01:03:31.547]  Justice department hearings.
[01:03:35.933 --> 01:03:39.574]  With people laughing in the background when they say, we want your cat.
[01:03:39.574 --> 01:03:45.477]  And it was kind of like that woman on the grand jury in Georgia, like, I wanted to put Trump under my control.
[01:03:45.477 --> 01:03:48.898]  And they're literally like, tell us about your cat.
[01:03:48.898 --> 01:03:49.638]  What's your cat smell?
[01:03:49.638 --> 01:03:52.539]  They're trying to like stir me up or something.
[01:03:52.539 --> 01:03:53.740]  It doesn't stir me up.
[01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:56.661]  It makes me really upset for this country.
[01:03:56.661 --> 01:03:57.281]  They're mad.
[01:03:57.281 --> 01:04:01.583]  I don't have these billions of dollars they claimed I did just because they lied in the media and said I had these things.
[01:04:01.583 --> 01:04:02.903]  It's not real.
[01:04:02.903 --> 01:04:04.444]  And now they want my cat.
[01:04:05.953 --> 01:04:10.677]  Ladies and gentlemen, the line in the sand is you cannot have the cat.
[01:04:10.677 --> 01:04:12.118]  I'm sorry.
[01:04:12.118 --> 01:04:16.281]  But hey, you can have my First Amendment and my guns, and I support world government.
[01:04:16.281 --> 01:04:18.063]  No, actually, you can't have that either.
[01:04:18.063 --> 01:04:21.586]  I'll see ya.
[01:04:21.586 --> 01:04:24.468]  So there you go.
[01:04:24.468 --> 01:04:34.836]  Now, this has organically taken up a life of its own, and people are making graphics like that image that was just put on the screen, Mooshu Army.
[01:04:36.010 --> 01:04:41.692]  So, look, Alex didn't want to take this next level, and that's... that's fine.
[01:04:41.692 --> 01:04:47.494]  This isn't even my cat, but if you have a pet... I mean, how sick is this?
[01:04:47.494 --> 01:04:49.294]  How sick is this?
[01:04:49.294 --> 01:04:51.695]  Yes, uh, are you hiding assets in that cat?
[01:04:51.695 --> 01:04:52.735]  How much is that cat worth?
[01:04:52.735 --> 01:04:56.856]  We may need to... we may need to, uh... take that cat.
[01:04:56.856 --> 01:05:00.458]  That is just... what is wrong with you?
[01:05:00.458 --> 01:05:00.938]  Right now,

[01:07:51.072 --> 01:07:55.193]  It's like, well, I mean, yeah.
[01:07:55.193 --> 01:07:57.754]  You're up here trying to crush us.
[01:07:57.754 --> 01:08:05.336]  You're up here bringing up money and stripping us down for the public.
[01:08:05.336 --> 01:08:06.537]  And you want to show the supplements?
[01:08:06.537 --> 01:08:07.597]  You want to show the website?
[01:08:08.865 --> 01:08:09.885]  What, are you going to turn this into an ad?
[01:08:09.885 --> 01:08:10.266]  What do you mean?
[01:08:10.266 --> 01:08:14.988]  I mean, it is an ad!
[01:08:14.988 --> 01:08:27.613]  So, okay, you want to go and bring Alex's cat, actually Alex's daughter's cat, into bankruptcy negotiations, and you want to ask about, yes, what's the value of that cat?
[01:08:27.613 --> 01:08:29.073]  Are you hiding assets in that cat?
[01:08:29.073 --> 01:08:32.735]  We may have to commandeer that cat.
[01:08:32.735 --> 01:08:34.816]  You're just not acting in good faith.
[01:08:34.816 --> 01:08:35.496]  You never were.
[01:08:37.153 --> 01:08:43.657]  And these weird communist-like pressure tactics and struggle sessions.
[01:08:43.657 --> 01:08:46.319]  So, okay.
[01:08:46.319 --> 01:08:47.840]  You want to go after Alex's cat?
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:53.284]  We'll go ahead and judo move that, and we'll turn it into a coupon code, and we'll fund ourselves at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:08:53.284 --> 01:09:04.591]  And we'll create a viral hashtag, Save Mooshu, because the video already has at least half a million views, posted last night.
[01:09:04.591 --> 01:09:05.632]  And it resonates with people.
[01:09:06.431 --> 01:09:08.713]  You have a pet out there?
[01:09:08.713 --> 01:09:10.874]  Pet you grew up with?
[01:09:10.874 --> 01:09:13.136]  Got a little daughter?
[01:09:13.136 --> 01:09:13.937]  She got a pet?
[01:09:13.937 --> 01:09:17.079]  Her first pet?
[01:09:17.079 --> 01:09:20.182]  How much is that worth?
[01:09:20.182 --> 01:09:21.262]  How much is that worth?
[01:09:21.262 --> 01:09:22.563]  Are you hiding assets?
[01:09:22.563 --> 01:09:23.304]  Yeah, you know what?
[01:09:23.304 --> 01:09:24.825]  You can strip me down naked.
[01:09:24.825 --> 01:09:27.968]  You can strip my bank accounts and take everything from me.
[01:09:27.968 --> 01:09:28.528]  But you know what?
[01:09:28.528 --> 01:09:34.953]  I still got the love of my family and we've got a nice pet here that is bonded with us too.
[01:09:34.953 --> 01:09:36.034]  How much is that worth?
[01:09:38.174 --> 01:09:41.035]  I don't know, I guess that's worth five trillion dollars.
[01:09:41.035 --> 01:09:44.196]  I guess you should, I guess we should, you know.
[01:09:44.196 --> 01:09:47.717]  Alex Jones is actually worth ten trillion dollars, Mushu.
[01:09:47.717 --> 01:09:51.378]  Mushu is a ten trillion dollar cat because you can't place a value on that love.
[01:09:51.378 --> 01:10:00.741]  You can't place a value on seeing your little daughter with her first pet and cuddling it and snuggling it and loving it.
[01:10:00.741 --> 01:10:03.122]  So yeah, I mean, I guess Mushu is worth ten trillion dollars.
[01:10:03.122 --> 01:10:03.922]  You found it.
[01:10:03.922 --> 01:10:05.823]  You found the secret asset.
[01:10:05.823 --> 01:10:06.483]  You guys did it.
[01:10:07.912 --> 01:10:11.354]  You found Alex Jones' secret asset, love.
[01:10:11.354 --> 01:10:11.954]  And guess what?
[01:10:11.954 --> 01:10:15.876]  It's, well, it's priceless, so... Yeah, you did it.
[01:10:15.876 --> 01:10:17.477]  You found the secret asset.
[01:10:17.477 --> 01:10:18.978]  The one you can't strip away.
[01:10:18.978 --> 01:10:21.539]  But isn't that what this is about?
[01:10:21.539 --> 01:10:24.281]  It's not enough just to take Alex's money.
[01:10:24.281 --> 01:10:28.803]  He has to be completely crushed!
[01:10:28.803 --> 01:10:31.325]  What would be left in life for Alex to enjoy?
[01:10:31.325 --> 01:10:33.106]  The love of others.
[01:10:33.106 --> 01:10:34.186]  His family.
[01:10:34.186 --> 01:10:35.727]  A pet.
[01:10:35.727 --> 01:10:36.788]  A little furry cat.
[01:10:38.109 --> 01:10:42.692]  No, that has to be... No, you don't even get that, Jones!
[01:10:42.692 --> 01:10:45.715]  So fine, you wanna play games?
[01:10:45.715 --> 01:10:47.076]  We'll play games.
[01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:54.241]  We'll shoot a little video and we'll show people the lovable fuzzball, the lovable furball, named Mooshu.
[01:10:54.241 --> 01:10:58.104]  And his cute little belly.
[01:10:58.104 --> 01:11:04.068]  And his fluffy, fluffy coat.
[01:11:04.068 --> 01:11:06.290]  With the Godzilla Goblin, Alex Jones.
[01:11:08.985 --> 01:11:12.927]  Petting his lovable cat.
[01:11:12.927 --> 01:11:15.228]  And you're gonna go and you're gonna ask about a cat.
[01:11:15.228 --> 01:11:19.369]  Can you even imagine that?
[01:11:19.369 --> 01:11:21.210]  Can you even imagine that?
[01:11:21.210 --> 01:11:32.955]  Think about the strip mining of Alex Jones' life and all the personal aspects that they have it written down like, ooh, look at this, he got a cat.
[01:11:32.955 --> 01:11:34.536]  What can we do with this cat?
[01:11:34.536 --> 01:11:36.497]  How can this cat play into the equation?
[01:11:38.373 --> 01:11:44.917]  And you know, Alex Jones jokingly says in the video, he says, what are you going to come up for my kids next?
[01:11:44.917 --> 01:11:48.539]  And obviously that's, you know, that's, that's sarcasm.
[01:11:48.539 --> 01:11:50.560]  But yet there's an element of truth there.
[01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:54.582]  It's like, well, what are your boundaries?
[01:11:54.582 --> 01:11:55.663]  What are your boundaries?
[01:11:55.663 --> 01:11:57.144]  Where, where do you draw the limit?
[01:11:57.144 --> 01:11:59.125]  What is the line in the sand?
[01:11:59.125 --> 01:12:04.948]  You want to make Alex Jones a slave for the rest of his days on the earth.
[01:12:04.948 --> 01:12:05.889]  But that's not enough.
[01:12:07.998 --> 01:12:13.364]  You gotta bring the cat into the equation, and maybe, maybe Jones' descendants, too.
[01:12:13.364 --> 01:12:18.470]  You know, how much... Jones, it looks like your son has a job.
[01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:20.593]  How much is your son worth?
[01:12:20.593 --> 01:12:21.894]  Maybe we call your son in here.
[01:12:21.894 --> 01:12:24.177]  Maybe we take some of his wages, too.
[01:12:24.177 --> 01:12:25.859]  Maybe we garnish his payments, too.
[01:12:25.859 --> 01:12:26.360]  How about that?
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:28.022]  It's like, where does it end?
[01:12:30.808 --> 01:12:33.289]  Alex Jones' great-great-grandkids.
[01:12:33.289 --> 01:12:35.391]  Like, hey, we gotta shake them down!
[01:12:35.391 --> 01:12:37.252]  Descendants of Alex Jones!
[01:12:37.252 --> 01:12:41.574]  One of them's got a cat!
[01:12:41.574 --> 01:12:44.295]  So, it's just sick.
[01:12:44.295 --> 01:12:49.218]  And really, the whole thing is just sick when you think about it.
[01:12:49.218 --> 01:12:56.122]  And in the bigger picture, you realize that what we're up against, of course there is eventually going to be an Alex Jones.
[01:12:57.878 --> 01:13:01.220]  Of course eventually there was going to be the canary in the coal mine.
[01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:04.722]  Of course eventually there was going to be the test case.
[01:13:04.722 --> 01:13:08.504]  You thought these tyrants were going to allow you to be free forever?
[01:13:08.504 --> 01:13:23.312]  You thought the tyrants that have occupied our government, you thought the tyrants going for world government, the eugenicists, the ones that like to do Satan worship at their award ceremonies, you thought they were just going to let you live free and prosperous?
[01:13:23.312 --> 01:13:25.453]  No, there was going to be an Alex Jones.
[01:13:26.496 --> 01:13:33.182]  There was going to be somebody to stand up and say no and call it out, and eventually that person was going to be destroyed.
[01:13:33.182 --> 01:13:35.864]  Because that's what tyrants do, that's what authoritarians do.
[01:13:35.864 --> 01:13:43.290]  So we're in that moment, and that's pretty normal actually for history, dealing with tyranny.
[01:13:43.290 --> 01:13:50.837]  But you think about America, you think about what we're supposed to stand for, and you think about how much we're supposed to value free speech, and you see this
[01:13:52.597 --> 01:14:07.728]  And it is truly insane that Alex Jones, the best way to put it into perspective, Alex Jones is the bad man from Sandy Hook, not the person that actually pulled the trigger and killed those poor kids.
[01:14:07.728 --> 01:14:13.893]  Not the person actually responsible for the grief, not the psychotic killer that actually pulled it off.
[01:14:13.893 --> 01:14:20.158]  No, a man that was hundreds of miles away in Austin, Texas,
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:42.692]  Speculating on major stories and mainstream news narratives, because we know we get lied to, and we know there's an agenda to take the guns, there always is when tyranny exists, to take your right to self-defense, to take your right to bear arms, and then he becomes the bad guy.
[01:14:42.692 --> 01:14:43.813]  But you know, he's tried to
[01:14:44.932 --> 01:14:53.394]  Remain calm and just take the beating that he knows he's destined to because he decided to stand up against these tyrants.
[01:14:53.394 --> 01:15:05.957]  And then you're gonna sit him down in a strip search, stripped down publicly, and you're gonna bring his daughter's cat up?
[01:15:05.957 --> 01:15:07.578]  Yeah.
[01:15:07.578 --> 01:15:08.338]  This is 1984-level stuff.
[01:15:08.338 --> 01:15:09.578]  This is formaldehyde-face-level stuff.
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:16.681]  So.
[01:15:16.681 --> 01:15:18.201]  Hashtag Save Mooshu.
[01:15:18.201 --> 01:15:21.142]  It's going viral right now.
[01:15:21.142 --> 01:15:22.443]  Mooshu Army rising up.
[01:15:22.443 --> 01:15:23.803]  Because, you know, people have pets.
[01:15:23.803 --> 01:15:24.643]  People can relate to that.
[01:15:24.643 --> 01:15:25.884]  People have kids that have pets.
[01:15:25.884 --> 01:15:26.804]  People can relate to that.
[01:15:26.804 --> 01:15:31.486]  It's just... It's just sick.
[01:15:31.486 --> 01:15:32.026]  Here's some more.
[01:15:32.026 --> 01:15:35.907]  Mooshu did nothing wrong.
[01:15:35.907 --> 01:15:38.348]  So, yeah, you know what?
[01:15:38.348 --> 01:15:39.648]  Tyrants want to show their hand.
[01:15:39.648 --> 01:15:41.149]  We'll show our hand too.
[01:15:41.149 --> 01:15:42.829]  We can have a little fun too, you know?
[01:15:42.829 --> 01:15:44.410]  We can be a little creative too, you know?

[01:19:50.401 --> 01:19:52.802]  In the last month, I got a little busy so I didn't sign the books.
[01:19:52.802 --> 01:19:53.682]  We didn't have them for sale.
[01:19:53.682 --> 01:19:55.203]  But now, I signed the last books.
[01:19:55.203 --> 01:20:00.105]  You can get them right now.
[01:20:00.105 --> 01:20:04.707]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:20:04.707 --> 01:20:05.988]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:16.019 --> 01:20:44.373]  Well, the Mooshu Army has risen and cat lovers all across the Fruited Plains are tweeting hashtag save Mooshu because the American left that hates Alex Jones guts so much is now trying to wring his pets, take his pets through the wringer with more of the fallout from the Sandy Hook case and the bankruptcy case.
[01:20:46.053 --> 01:20:48.855]  And so, this is where we're at now.
[01:20:48.855 --> 01:21:11.794]  You have to discuss the value of your cat, and you have to be questioned whether you're hiding assets in your cat, and it's your little daughter's cat, as if that's some sort of a threat, like it's gonna be taken in the bankruptcy and sold off.
[01:21:11.794 --> 01:21:13.255]  We're gonna pawn off Alex's cat.
[01:21:15.247 --> 01:21:22.270]  Because he's got to pay his... Well, you know the story.
[01:21:22.270 --> 01:21:27.092]  It's almost not even fair to bring them into it at this point.
[01:21:27.092 --> 01:21:28.812]  But, uh, that's what you get.
[01:21:28.812 --> 01:21:32.434]  So, hashtag Save Mooshu, and I've got good news, folks.
[01:21:32.434 --> 01:21:39.537]  If you're listening right now, and I don't know how long this is going to last, I've kind of taken a little step into the abyss here today.
[01:21:39.537 --> 01:21:42.078]  Alex is not in right now.
[01:21:43.135 --> 01:21:50.681]  And so I made an executive decision, and I've launched coupon code SaveMushu.
[01:21:50.681 --> 01:21:55.404]  Now, it's spelled M-U-S-H-U.
[01:21:55.404 --> 01:21:56.505]  SaveMushu.

[01:22:10.675 --> 01:22:17.157]  Alex might call me and say, you're a madman, we can't do that right now, we need the funds, shut it down, while I'm on air.

[01:22:33.504 --> 01:22:36.685]  Now, Alex may like the idea and we'll be able to keep it up,
[01:22:37.847 --> 01:22:40.809]  But he might also say, nope, we're not going to do it, shut it down.
[01:22:40.809 --> 01:22:44.111]  But I don't know, I made the executive decision, I'm stepping out on a limb.
[01:22:44.111 --> 01:22:48.213]  Coupon code SAVEMUSHU, 10% off at checkout.
[01:22:48.213 --> 01:22:55.458]  10% off at checkout with coupon code SAVEMUSHU.

[01:23:01.857 --> 01:23:05.499]  So, oh my gosh, but I guess they really did figure it out, folks.
[01:23:05.499 --> 01:23:06.640]  I mean, what is the value?
[01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:07.961]  What is your pet worth to you?
[01:23:07.961 --> 01:23:10.103]  You know, some people will die for their pets.
[01:23:10.103 --> 01:23:14.986]  Have died for their pets.
[01:23:14.986 --> 01:23:18.989]  Some people have gone through a lot with their pets.
[01:23:18.989 --> 01:23:21.531]  Some people have been there when their pets passed on.
[01:23:22.748 --> 01:23:24.549]  I know I've had that before.
[01:23:24.549 --> 01:23:27.872]  I had to put down my first pet.
[01:23:27.872 --> 01:23:32.835]  The dog we had for about 15, 16 years.
[01:23:32.835 --> 01:23:37.318]  And nobody wanted to be there when it was put down ultimately.
[01:23:37.318 --> 01:23:41.060]  So I decided I'll go ahead and I'll be there with him.
[01:23:41.060 --> 01:23:42.562]  Old Edmund.
[01:23:42.562 --> 01:23:46.724]  Great Fox Terrier dog.
[01:23:46.724 --> 01:23:48.185]  And there's a special bond there.
[01:23:48.185 --> 01:23:49.766]  There's a special connection there.
[01:23:49.766 --> 01:23:51.828]  And it means even more when it's a family pet.
[01:23:53.345 --> 01:23:56.548]  And when it's your daughter's or son's pet?
[01:23:56.548 --> 01:23:58.649]  So, oh, how much is that cat worth, Jones?
[01:23:58.649 --> 01:23:59.670]  Well, I don't know.
[01:23:59.670 --> 01:24:04.474]  Ten quadrillion dollars?
[01:24:04.474 --> 01:24:05.955]  It's priceless, man.
[01:24:05.955 --> 01:24:07.436]  It's a bond.
[01:24:07.436 --> 01:24:10.738]  It's a love.
[01:24:10.738 --> 01:24:14.101]  Like, this is some communist pressure test struggle system.
[01:24:14.101 --> 01:24:16.723]  Like, yeah, let's bring his cat into this.
[01:24:16.723 --> 01:24:18.264]  That'll break Jones.
[01:24:18.264 --> 01:24:20.206]  We'll finally break Jones then.
[01:24:22.352 --> 01:24:25.333]  Like, oh yeah, you know, his little daughter's cat.
[01:24:25.333 --> 01:24:27.514]  Yeah, you guys got it.
[01:24:27.514 --> 01:24:33.015]  So, okay, hey, you guys want to, you know, the gloves are off with them, you know, obviously.
[01:24:33.015 --> 01:24:40.658]  So, yeah, it's like in the famous courtroom moment with Alex Jones and the lawyers.
[01:24:40.658 --> 01:24:42.698]  He's like, oh, you're going to turn that into an ad, Jones?
[01:24:42.698 --> 01:24:44.059]  You're going to turn that into a promo?
[01:24:44.978 --> 01:24:50.142]  It's like, well, gee man, I mean, I don't know, you're trying to sue us for billions of dollars.
[01:24:50.142 --> 01:24:53.104]  This whole thing is going to be seen by millions of people on YouTube.
[01:24:53.104 --> 01:24:54.605]  You're making it a big spectacle.
[01:24:54.605 --> 01:24:56.687]  You're certainly getting paid off this.
[01:24:56.687 --> 01:25:07.355]  But, oh yeah, I mean, if you're going to mention InfoWarsStore.com while millions of people are watching and you're suing me for billions of dollars, well, I guess I'll talk about InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:25:07.355 --> 01:25:10.197]  And if you want to know what the value of Alex Jones' cat is,
[01:25:12.452 --> 01:25:13.973]  You want to bring his cat into this?
[01:25:13.973 --> 01:25:16.215]  Well, I guess we'll bring his cat into this.
[01:25:16.215 --> 01:25:22.921]  We'll bring the lovable, fluffball, Mushu.
[01:25:22.921 --> 01:25:26.864]  We love you, Mushu.
[01:25:26.864 --> 01:25:32.469]  Hashtag Save Mushu is going viral right now on Twitter.
[01:25:32.469 --> 01:25:35.252]  Because, again, you guys did this!
[01:25:37.682 --> 01:25:43.926]  Oh, but see, they can print news stories all day long of, Alex did this, Alex Jones did that.
[01:25:43.926 --> 01:25:46.487]  This is what's going on in Alex's personal life.
[01:25:46.487 --> 01:25:54.371]  And then they want to ask about the value of his cat in a bankruptcy hearing, and we're not allowed to talk about it?
[01:25:54.371 --> 01:25:56.072]  We're not going to talk about it?
[01:25:56.072 --> 01:25:58.574]  We're not going to make it a thing?
[01:25:58.574 --> 01:26:01.796]  The Mooshu Army has arisen, folks.
[01:26:01.796 --> 01:26:04.037]  The Mooshu Army has awakened.
[01:26:06.289 --> 01:26:13.151]  Sometimes you just... And so the original video from Alex's wife on Twitter has over a million views.
[01:26:13.151 --> 01:26:15.592]  Let's keep sharing that.
[01:26:15.592 --> 01:26:16.852]  No, thank you.
[01:26:16.852 --> 01:26:23.354]  Thank you for showing us what you think and how you think and how you operate and what it's all about.
[01:26:23.354 --> 01:26:23.935]  Thank you.
[01:26:23.935 --> 01:26:27.796]  It's like they want to act like Russia.
[01:26:28.882 --> 01:26:31.323]  They want to act like Russia's this big threat.
[01:26:31.323 --> 01:26:35.765]  They want to act like Russia's these communists, these oppressors are in Russia.
[01:26:35.765 --> 01:26:37.506]  The oppressors are in Russia!
[01:26:37.506 --> 01:26:41.167]  And then you look at what they've done to Alex Jones.
[01:26:41.167 --> 01:26:44.329]  No, see, that's what communist oppressors do.
[01:26:44.329 --> 01:26:51.792]  Everything they want you to believe Russia is, everything they want you to believe Putin is, they are.
[01:26:51.792 --> 01:26:53.313]  So!
[01:26:53.313 --> 01:26:54.874]  Could be very limited time.
[01:26:54.874 --> 01:26:55.334]  I don't know.
[01:26:56.303 --> 01:27:00.346]  I greenlit it without even the big man's approval.
[01:27:00.346 --> 01:27:06.111]  I'm stepping out on a limb out here for Mooshu today, but I'm part of the Mooshu Army and I want to save Mooshu.
[01:27:06.111 --> 01:27:09.493]  Precious little Mooshu.
[01:27:09.493 --> 01:27:13.476]  So coupon code SAVEMOOSHU at checkout, 10% off at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:27:13.476 --> 01:27:21.783]  I didn't even mean to make this a plug, but I said, hey, I watched that video last night and that tugged at my heartstrings.
[01:27:22.905 --> 01:27:25.948]  And I've got pets.
[01:27:25.948 --> 01:27:28.930]  You in the audience probably have pets or you've had pets.
[01:27:28.930 --> 01:27:31.873]  Maybe you've got your daughter, her first pet, your son's first pet.
[01:27:31.873 --> 01:27:34.415]  I mean, it's just sick.
[01:27:34.415 --> 01:27:35.096]  So yeah, you know what?
[01:27:35.096 --> 01:27:36.457]  People are going to relate to that.
[01:27:36.457 --> 01:27:37.538]  And that's what they do.
[01:27:37.538 --> 01:27:39.519]  They say, oh, see, look, kids died.
[01:27:39.519 --> 01:27:40.240]  You can relate to that.
[01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:42.442]  That's one of the worst things ever, having your kid die.
[01:27:42.442 --> 01:27:43.543]  See how bad it is?
[01:27:43.543 --> 01:27:47.606]  And then they project that whole thing onto Alex like he did it.
[01:27:47.606 --> 01:27:50.349]  So they want to tug at your heartstrings to hurt Alex Jones.
[01:27:52.025 --> 01:27:58.969]  Well okay, we're gonna, we're gonna, you guys want to make that an issue, we'll play that game too.
[01:27:58.969 --> 01:28:01.550]  We'll tug at the heartstrings to save free speech.
[01:28:01.550 --> 01:28:05.432]  We'll tug at the heartstrings to save America.
[01:28:05.432 --> 01:28:06.673]  But it's only a judo move.
[01:28:06.673 --> 01:28:08.334]  It's only a judo move in self-defense.
[01:28:08.334 --> 01:28:11.476]  You come at us, we judo you.
[01:28:11.476 --> 01:28:14.777]  You bring the cat into it, we judo it.

[01:28:18.659 --> 01:28:20.701]  Now, we're gonna get a little more serious.
[01:28:21.721 --> 01:28:25.444]  When we come back here with Joel Skousen.
[01:28:25.444 --> 01:28:27.526]  And there is a problem now.
[01:28:27.526 --> 01:28:30.088]  The American people do not support this war in Ukraine.
[01:28:30.088 --> 01:28:34.391]  That war propaganda speech in Poland did not help.
[01:28:34.391 --> 01:28:38.234]  The air raid siren tactic in Ukraine did not help.
[01:28:38.234 --> 01:28:42.117]  In fact, less Americans now support the war than they did a year ago.
[01:28:42.117 --> 01:28:44.299]  And the Republican Party is now split on the funding.
[01:28:44.299 --> 01:28:46.921]  The Democrats are all aboard for funding it.
[01:28:46.921 --> 01:28:49.583]  Maybe somebody should track and trace that money and see where it's going.
[01:28:51.305 --> 01:28:55.902]  So Biden is going to have to launch, announce, and go about this war with Russia himself.
[01:28:59.611 --> 01:29:07.816]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic book that documents the Globals, in their own words, plan for our future.
[01:29:07.816 --> 01:29:09.257]  That is a hellish future.
[01:29:09.257 --> 01:29:18.682]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or Infowars.com.
[01:29:18.682 --> 01:29:24.266]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[01:29:24.266 --> 01:29:26.247]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[01:29:26.827 --> 01:29:32.209]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy, at InfoWarsWare.com.
[01:29:32.209 --> 01:29:36.150]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.

[01:30:11.938 --> 01:30:20.301]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in, many of you for years, and never gone to mfullerstore.com.

[01:30:59.369 --> 01:31:02.092]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[01:31:02.092 --> 01:31:06.957]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies.
[01:31:06.957 --> 01:31:12.282]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication, it takes commitment.
[01:31:12.282 --> 01:31:22.313]  That's why I ask listeners respectfully to go to mfullmorestore.com and buy great products that will enrich and empower your life while keeping us on air at the very same time.
[01:31:22.993 --> 01:31:29.239]  InfoWarStore.com to get a signed or unsigned copy of my book, The Great Reset and War for the World.
[01:31:29.239 --> 01:31:38.888]  Ultimate Bone Broth, Back in Stock, Nitric Boost, the amazing CBD oil we have that's the highest quality you're going to find anywhere at more than half off.
[01:31:38.888 --> 01:31:41.090]  It's all available at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:31:41.090 --> 01:31:43.592]  Some of the very best products and a lot of you have
[01:31:43.652 --> 01:31:43.972]  Thank you.
[01:31:59.201 --> 01:32:11.876]  Every time I talk to you, you're either, like, on the border, exposing the cartels, and, like, coming under fire, or you're on the streets of some American city hanging out with drug addicts and criminals, and now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill.
[01:32:11.876 --> 01:32:13.658]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah?
[01:32:13.658 --> 01:32:15.420]  Have you ever considered that for a second?
[01:32:15.808 --> 01:32:18.610]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans.
[01:32:18.610 --> 01:32:20.331]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth.
[01:32:20.331 --> 01:32:22.833]  And again, you know, I have InfoWars to thank for that.
[01:32:22.833 --> 01:32:32.920]  Looking back on the day I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions, I was so grateful because, you know, I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and under the InfoWars team.
[01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:37.904]  And I really do credit that as to why I'm able to, you know, get these types of clips.
[01:32:37.904 --> 01:32:41.046]  Because Alex's whole mentality was, you know, go where the
[01:32:41.186 --> 01:32:44.928]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:14.756 --> 01:33:16.117]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:33:16.117 --> 01:33:27.006]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show and now your host Owen Troyer.
[01:33:27.006 --> 01:33:38.295]  A thorn in the side of tyrants and proud to be right here with you on the Alex Jones Show and Joel Skousen joins us now.
[01:33:38.295 --> 01:33:38.716]  Well Joel,
[01:33:39.870 --> 01:33:58.166]  We've been talking about preparedness, preparing for the worst, from different kinds of things, all kinds of different disasters, from EMP attacks to earthquakes, and you're somewhat of the expert when it comes to relocation and strategy in a disaster.
[01:33:58.166 --> 01:34:00.429]  And so, when I look at 2023,
[01:34:03.183 --> 01:34:17.015]  When I look at now, I think maybe the realist threat of a world war or a nuclear war that I've faced in my lifetime, I mean, 33 short years on this planet, I think certainly for me this is the most tense
[01:34:17.987 --> 01:34:21.110]  geopolitical wartime I've ever seen.
[01:34:21.110 --> 01:34:28.276]  And so the threat of thermonuclear war now, perhaps not such a far-fetched thing to think about.
[01:34:28.276 --> 01:34:36.523]  So when you see what's going on in Ukraine between Russia and the warmongering and the saber-rattling, what goes through your head?
[01:34:36.523 --> 01:34:38.845]  What are you telling friends and family?
[01:34:38.845 --> 01:34:44.489]  And how do you even start that conversation with people that might not understand how serious this is?
[01:34:44.489 --> 01:34:45.070]  Joel Skousen.
[01:34:47.059 --> 01:34:49.620]  Well, it's good to be with you, Owen.
[01:34:49.620 --> 01:35:11.287]  As I've been on with Alex at least two or three times about the Ukraine war, I am continually concerned about the fact that conservatives who basically don't support the war erroneously think that, you know, Russia's the good guy in this, that it's trying to dismantle the Anglo-globalist conspiracy that we deal with.
[01:35:11.287 --> 01:35:12.507]  And it really isn't true.
[01:35:12.507 --> 01:35:14.328]  It's true that Russia and China
[01:35:14.881 --> 01:35:33.217]  Are against our globalists, but not because they intend to, you know, give any semblance of freedom to the world, but because they want to establish their own system of new world order, very tyrannical in the aftermath of what is going to become an inevitable World War III and nuclear war.
[01:35:33.217 --> 01:35:35.699]  But it won't start with Ukraine.
[01:35:35.699 --> 01:35:41.484]  And the reason I say that I've explained this in my world affairs brief numerous times, but I'll do it one more time for your audience.
[01:35:42.689 --> 01:35:44.490]  Russia could use its nukes.
[01:35:44.490 --> 01:35:57.580]  It has the largest arsenal and the largest set of missiles with up to 15 warheads each on the missiles compared to our puny 400 missiles that we took the three warheads off of and replaced them a single warhead.
[01:35:57.580 --> 01:36:02.123]  So they've got about 15,000 weapons and we've got 400.
[01:36:02.123 --> 01:36:11.890]  But Russia can't use them against the West because it doesn't have the conventional military that can occupy and consolidate the gains from such a destructive attack.
[01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:16.403]  That would allow the West to simply rebuild and come back against Russia.
[01:36:16.403 --> 01:36:23.508]  See, Russia can't even occupy Eastern Ukraine, let alone all of Ukraine, let alone all of Europe, let alone the United States.
[01:36:23.508 --> 01:36:30.933]  So it must wait for China to be ready to do this preemptive nuclear strike against military targets.
[01:36:30.933 --> 01:36:33.114]  That's not going to happen because of Ukraine.
[01:36:33.114 --> 01:36:41.040]  There will be another trigger event that has to involve China, and that's most likely either Taiwan or North Korea.
[01:36:42.094 --> 01:36:45.535]  It used to be North Korea only because we have 27,000 U.S.
[01:36:45.535 --> 01:36:52.457]  troops there and we must respond if North Korea, which is a puppet state of China, attacks South Korea and U.S.
[01:36:52.457 --> 01:36:53.817]  troops there.
[01:36:53.817 --> 01:36:54.858]  But now that the U.S.
[01:36:54.858 --> 01:37:00.899]  has announced they're putting in 100 to 200 advisors into Taiwan, it also makes Taiwan a trigger event.
[01:37:00.899 --> 01:37:06.481]  Not as big as one as North Korea, but a trigger event nevertheless, and it may deter China
[01:37:07.245 --> 01:37:16.348]  From attacking Taiwan until they're fully ready to take on the West in World War III, which I don't expect until the latter half of this decade.
[01:37:16.348 --> 01:37:22.590]  So while I believe that the war is inevitable, Owen, I don't believe that Ukraine is going to be the trigger event for that war.
[01:37:24.127 --> 01:37:34.940]  What do you make of the phenomenon that I've seen playing out, and I wish it wasn't this way, of the Western political elite pushing Russia into the arms of China?
[01:37:34.940 --> 01:37:43.470]  To me, Russia is a more natural ally with the United States, and in fact, historically has been an enemy of Russia, but...
[01:37:44.111 --> 01:37:55.978]  Our political elites, they've become so deranged and not willing to negotiate or come to terms with a new Russia as a world leader, and they've pushed them right into the arms of China.
[01:37:55.978 --> 01:38:00.001]  Why are they so stupid to do that?
[01:38:00.001 --> 01:38:03.083]  Well, actually it's not true, Owen.
[01:38:03.083 --> 01:38:07.866]  The Russians and Chinese have been in alliance to destroy the West for decades now.
[01:38:09.002 --> 01:38:16.125]  And I can't believe that conservatives don't remember all of the things that have gone on for years from 1970 through 1999.
[01:38:16.125 --> 01:38:25.470]  Looks like the Russians may have cut him off.
[01:38:25.470 --> 01:38:26.190]  Did we lose Joel?
[01:38:31.992 --> 01:38:37.676]  All right, well, it looks like he's been cut off by the Chinese Communist.
[01:38:37.676 --> 01:38:38.817]  Okay, he's back now, Joel.
[01:38:38.817 --> 01:38:41.579]  You cut off right when... No, you know what, guys?
[01:38:41.579 --> 01:38:42.379]  We're gonna have to reconnect.
[01:38:42.379 --> 01:38:44.821]  He's frozen again, I think.
[01:38:44.821 --> 01:38:45.702]  I think I'm back.
[01:38:45.702 --> 01:38:46.342]  Okay, there it is.
[01:38:46.342 --> 01:38:48.083]  We've got you.
[01:38:48.083 --> 01:38:59.251]  So... All right, we'll have to get reconnected with Joel there.
[01:39:01.448 --> 01:39:05.332]  And he's talking about the situation between Russia and China.
[01:39:05.332 --> 01:39:07.134]  Now, I just saw that on the Drudge Report.
[01:39:07.134 --> 01:39:10.817]  The header on the screen, Zelensky plans to meet with President Xi.
[01:39:10.817 --> 01:39:19.205]  Now, this is, of course, after diplomatic meetings have gone down between the Chinese and the Russians.
[01:39:19.205 --> 01:39:23.189]  And this is actually going on this week that happened.
[01:39:23.189 --> 01:39:25.351]  So, this is an interesting move.
[01:39:26.877 --> 01:39:31.802]  I don't know much more than what I'm seeing on the screen there as this is breaking today.
[01:39:31.802 --> 01:39:33.344]  Zelensky to visit Xi.
[01:39:33.344 --> 01:39:34.445]  I wonder how that's going to go.
[01:39:34.445 --> 01:39:37.708]  Is he going to fly to China?
[01:39:37.708 --> 01:39:40.351]  And do you think Zelensky will be wearing his sweatshirt?
[01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:46.303]  Which sweatshirt do you think Zelensky will be wearing when he meets with Xi?
[01:39:46.303 --> 01:39:51.566]  Or will he actually put on a suit and tie for that meeting?
[01:39:51.566 --> 01:40:06.274]  Or maybe he'll reach into his wardrobe and find one of those gay, kink, gimp, leather daddy outfits that he's so known to dance in and rub up against other men in.
[01:40:06.274 --> 01:40:10.036]  Maybe that will be the choice outfit for Zelensky when he visits Xi.
[01:40:11.617 --> 01:40:25.462]  Or maybe he'll really virtue signal and try to wear something of a Chinese style garment, even though most Chinese leaders just wear suits and ties.
[01:40:25.462 --> 01:40:27.202]  So we shall see that.
[01:40:27.202 --> 01:40:31.044]  But that's a desperation move.
[01:40:31.044 --> 01:40:33.425]  But it just shows you how weak the Biden administration is.
[01:40:34.887 --> 01:40:43.070]  That it's Zelensky that has to go to China to try to negotiate and it's not Biden and it's not Blinken and it's not Sullivan.
[01:40:43.070 --> 01:40:47.512]  And you may remember Blinken was set to go visit China.
[01:40:49.426 --> 01:40:59.368]  And then the spy balloon phenomenon happened and they cancelled that meeting and they've also cancelled other such meetings since then.
[01:40:59.368 --> 01:41:15.271]  So diplomacy between China and the United States has gone severely downhill and apparently is so bad now that Zelensky has to go to China for negotiation and not Biden or a member of the Biden administration.
[01:41:15.271 --> 01:41:17.472]  So that really shows you how far things have fallen.
[01:41:18.590 --> 01:41:21.592]  That it's Zelensky who's going to go over there and beg.
[01:41:21.592 --> 01:41:35.762]  Now Zelensky said on Ukrainian state-run television, he actually said that if China and Russia form an alliance, and if China supplies Russians with weapons, that's World War III.
[01:41:35.762 --> 01:41:37.984]  He said that!
[01:41:37.984 --> 01:41:39.125]  Like it was no big deal!
[01:41:41.961 --> 01:41:43.241]  No, that actually is a big deal.
[01:41:43.241 --> 01:41:45.942]  So maybe China has saner heads and they're like, yeah, you know what?
[01:41:45.942 --> 01:41:49.663]  You said you want World War III if we get into an alliance with Russia.
[01:41:49.663 --> 01:41:53.963]  You want to maybe talk about that?
[01:41:53.963 --> 01:41:55.244]  I wonder how that one's going to go.
[01:41:55.244 --> 01:41:58.464]  Is Xi trying to make a power move here?
[01:41:58.464 --> 01:42:00.465]  Is Xi going to try to make a power move here?
[01:42:00.465 --> 01:42:06.466]  Or is this just Zelensky coming with his hand out and having to replace
[01:42:07.677 --> 01:42:19.906]  The Biden team, because they're so, I guess, disrespected or ignored by China at this point as a non-entity, so they're going to have to send Zelensky.
[01:42:19.906 --> 01:42:22.468]  All this war propaganda is failing.
[01:42:22.468 --> 01:42:24.170]  The American people don't want this war.
[01:42:24.170 --> 01:42:26.271]  The European people don't want this war.
[01:42:26.271 --> 01:42:28.693]  Most NATO countries don't want this war.
[01:42:28.693 --> 01:42:30.414]  Most European countries don't want this war.
[01:42:31.425 --> 01:42:33.427]  It's Biden banging the drums.
[01:42:33.427 --> 01:42:35.129]  It's Poland banging the drums.
[01:42:35.129 --> 01:42:37.411]  It's Zelensky banging the drums.
[01:42:37.411 --> 01:42:43.196]  Hey, but Biden went to Ukraine, cut a $500 million check, and flew home.
[01:42:43.196 --> 01:42:45.318]  Still hasn't been to Ohio.
[01:42:45.318 --> 01:42:47.220]  Still hasn't been to East Palestine, Ohio.
[01:42:47.220 --> 01:42:49.162]  Still hasn't cut them a check.
[01:42:49.162 --> 01:42:52.065]  But don't worry, Zelensky's got a check.
[01:42:52.065 --> 01:42:55.368]  He shoved it right into his leather thong.
[01:42:59.497 --> 01:43:01.458]  I've got some good news.
[01:43:01.458 --> 01:43:08.321]  Our high-quality supplements really work, and we have about an 80% reorder rate with customers.
[01:43:08.321 --> 01:43:09.141]  That's the good news.
[01:43:09.141 --> 01:43:10.282]  They're amazing.
[01:43:10.282 --> 01:43:18.486]  The bad news is, around 1% or a little less of our actual viewers and listeners ever go to Infowarshore.com and ever actually buy the products.
[01:43:18.486 --> 01:43:21.927]  So you're missing out on these products, plus it funds the InfoWar.
[01:43:21.927 --> 01:43:26.849]  Think of what we've done with just 1% of our massive audience actually buying products.
[01:43:26.849 --> 01:43:27.670]  Think what would happen.
[01:43:28.590 --> 01:43:42.140]  If those of you on the fence actually went to InfoWarStore.com and got some of these amazing products, I would recommend Turmeric 95 for your joints, your bones, inflammation, to get one of the biggest effects, so you reorder it and see how great it is.
[01:43:42.140 --> 01:43:51.106]  Also, we've got the super high-quality, full-spectrum CBD oil that's so good for your neurological systems, your brain, your joints, your bones, as well.
[01:43:51.106 --> 01:43:52.467]  Or Real Red Pill Plus.
[01:43:52.467 --> 01:43:56.910]  Just go try the product, fund the InfoWar, and help us defeat the new world together.
[01:43:56.910 --> 01:43:58.111]  InfoWarStore.com.
[01:44:03.652 --> 01:44:05.413]  This is their big move.
[01:44:05.413 --> 01:44:09.194]  So yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[01:44:09.194 --> 01:44:10.914]  He doesn't care.
[01:44:10.914 --> 01:44:12.154]  That's not his job.
[01:44:12.154 --> 01:44:13.915]  He's not the president of the United States.
[01:44:13.915 --> 01:44:17.776]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[01:44:17.776 --> 01:44:22.257]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[01:44:22.257 --> 01:44:23.377]  They must be opposed.
[01:44:24.011 --> 01:44:27.432]  Autocrats only understand one word.
[01:44:27.432 --> 01:44:28.613]  No.
[01:44:28.613 --> 01:44:29.453]  No.
[01:44:29.453 --> 01:44:30.213]  No.
[01:44:30.213 --> 01:44:31.094]  Exactly.
[01:44:31.094 --> 01:44:34.675]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[01:44:34.675 --> 01:44:37.776]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[01:44:37.776 --> 01:44:40.257]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[01:44:40.257 --> 01:44:42.758]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[01:44:42.758 --> 01:44:46.379]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[01:44:46.379 --> 01:44:48.900]  We say no to you getting us into World War III.
[01:44:48.900 --> 01:44:49.300]  You're right.
[01:44:49.580 --> 01:44:54.322]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden, and we say no!
[01:44:54.322 --> 01:45:00.525]  And we say no to your war!
[01:45:00.525 --> 01:45:03.667]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[01:45:03.667 --> 01:45:05.968]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:45:05.968 --> 01:45:09.890]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:45:09.890 --> 01:45:13.832]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[01:45:15.270 --> 01:45:18.816]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:45:18.816 --> 01:45:25.707]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[01:45:25.707 --> 01:45:26.629]  It's really just incredible.
[01:45:27.637 --> 01:45:31.278]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:45:31.278 --> 01:45:37.060]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:45:37.060 --> 01:45:39.520]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:40.101]  Keep doing it.
[01:45:40.101 --> 01:45:47.143]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[01:45:47.143 --> 01:45:48.323]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[01:45:49.024 --> 01:45:53.333]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at m4store.com.
[01:45:53.333 --> 01:45:58.304]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to m4store.com, our funding problems will be over.
[01:45:58.304 --> 01:45:59.065]  Please take action now.
[01:46:01.443 --> 01:46:07.865]  It's hard to believe that we're already going into March 2023, and the world is an insane place.
[01:46:07.865 --> 01:46:09.586]  World War III has already started.
[01:46:09.586 --> 01:46:11.907]  Biden is a puppet and is dissolving our borders.
[01:46:11.907 --> 01:46:13.087]  There's mass censorship.
[01:46:13.087 --> 01:46:15.288]  James O'Keefe's been removed from Project Veritas.
[01:46:15.288 --> 01:46:17.548]  The list goes on and on of the bad things that are happening.
[01:46:17.548 --> 01:46:21.910]  But the good things that are happening is humanity is really accelerating its awakening.
[01:46:22.210 --> 01:46:26.133]  But those of us on the forefront are under more attack by the establishment than ever.
[01:46:26.133 --> 01:46:34.560]  That's why I'm counting on you to spread the word about the broadcast, to pray for the broadcast, and to keep the broadcast on the air by getting great products at InfoWarsaw.com.
[01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:43.228]  And whether it's a final signed copy that are almost all sold out, or the great reset in the War for the World, or Ultimate Bone Broth finally back in stock after over two years, it's all available at InfoWarsaw.com.
[01:46:43.228 --> 01:46:44.829]  These are truly amazing products.
[01:46:44.989 --> 01:46:51.174]  So get your InfoWars products at InfoWarsStore.com and enrich your life while keeping the broadcast on the air.
[01:46:51.174 --> 01:47:00.262]  It is your decision on whether or not we stay on air, so please take action now at InfoWarsStore.
[01:47:00.262 --> 01:47:06.167]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:12.879 --> 01:47:31.405]  All right, Joel Skousen lost his internet.
[01:47:31.405 --> 01:47:34.126]  A Chinese spy balloon flew over his home and shut it off.
[01:47:35.485 --> 01:47:38.649]  Well, why don't you tell me what I last was saying, because I don't know when I was cut off particularly.
[01:47:58.103 --> 01:48:20.724]  Well you were disagreeing with me because I view the world that the Western elites have pushed Russia into the arms of China when to me Putin is more of a romantic with the West and I think would have rather be allied with the West and that's what I see from his speeches but you were saying you think that's not so much the case and that now the China-Russia alliance is something that's been around for a while.
[01:48:22.422 --> 01:48:23.203]  That's right.
[01:48:23.203 --> 01:48:27.406]  In fact, I covered this in today's World Affairs Brief, which just came out.
[01:48:27.406 --> 01:48:35.111]  Your listeners can get a free sample copy by going to worldaffairsbrief.com and clicking on Request a Sample.
[01:48:35.111 --> 01:48:41.535]  But what I outlined is several conservative commentators who have made this same point, and it's very common.
[01:48:41.535 --> 01:48:50.762]  I don't fault you for bringing this, but remember that just like Putin's speech on the 21st, he's playing to the West as well as to his own people.
[01:48:52.684 --> 01:49:03.770]  The Communists have always been masters of deception, and as I say, when they faked their own demise, the world bought into it completely, mostly because our own globals let them get away with it.
[01:49:03.770 --> 01:49:14.376]  I mean, if I could see through it, and Christopher Story of the UK, we were the only two commentators that detailed the evidence that it was a phony fall.
[01:49:14.376 --> 01:49:20.580]  But Putin is the dictatorial leader of Russia.
[01:49:21.525 --> 01:49:23.746]  A real democracy at all.
[01:49:23.746 --> 01:49:28.268]  The Communist Party still controls all the major parties in play.
[01:49:28.268 --> 01:49:35.732]  Though they're, you know, even in the Kremlin, you hear the words, you know, the party says this, the party, and they're not talking the United Party of Vladimir Putin.
[01:49:35.732 --> 01:49:43.716]  So you believe, so you still believe that Russia is communist and Putin is a communist even though they broke up the Soviet Union in the 90s?
[01:49:43.716 --> 01:49:44.857]  But they didn't break it up.
[01:49:44.857 --> 01:49:46.438]  That's, I mean, they let it go.
[01:49:46.438 --> 01:49:49.259]  Well then why are they in Ukraine?
[01:49:49.259 --> 01:49:50.019]  I'll tell you why.
[01:49:50.019 --> 01:49:51.140]  Now remember,
[01:49:51.826 --> 01:49:58.491]  Before the breakup, and they did this breakup to get aid and trade from the West, and it worked like a charm.
[01:49:58.491 --> 01:50:06.656]  Western companies completely rebuilt the entire oil system in Russia, which made it, you know, one of the most oil powerhouses in the world.
[01:50:06.656 --> 01:50:09.018]  They never could have done it on their own.
[01:50:09.018 --> 01:50:12.741]  We gave them, you know, financial aid, pallet fulls of $100 bills.
[01:50:12.741 --> 01:50:18.945]  That's why the oligarchs, you know, had only $100 bills to spend when they went to Europe.
[01:50:18.945 --> 01:50:20.286]  They had nothing else for tips.
[01:50:21.299 --> 01:50:45.002]  But the point is, is that before the phony fall of the Soviet Union, before they appeared to let it break up, they mandated it by the way, it wasn't that they let people be free per se, they moved in hundreds of thousands of Russians to the Baltic states and they put Donbass and Crimea into the boundaries of Ukraine.
[01:50:45.919 --> 01:50:53.923]  Now, these are Russian-speaking areas, and they put them in there so that they could have an excuse to come and invade, which is exactly what they did in Ukraine.
[01:50:53.923 --> 01:51:01.927]  So it was a complete lie when Putin said, we don't want Ukraine coming into NATO because we don't want NATO on the border.
[01:51:01.927 --> 01:51:05.789]  They already have NATO on the border with the Baltics.
[01:51:05.789 --> 01:51:10.832]  And when the NATO countries even declined to let Georgia join NATO,
[01:51:12.492 --> 01:51:19.354]  Because of concerns, Russian security concerns, in 2006, Russia invaded Georgia anyway.
[01:51:19.354 --> 01:51:22.395]  So you see, that was an excuse that just doesn't pan out.
[01:51:22.395 --> 01:51:34.039]  The point is, they let go of the former Soviet states, but the corruption remained, and the corruption remains in Ukraine, the corruption remains in Hungary, it remains in Poland, etc.
[01:51:34.039 --> 01:51:35.380]  In fact, you know, Lech Walesa,
[01:51:40.579 --> 01:51:42.599]  So what's the answer for Ukraine then?
[01:51:42.599 --> 01:51:54.962]  Because right now the struggle appears to be either you're going to be backed by the West and you're going to have a Western-favoring president or you're going to have a Russian-favoring president.
[01:51:54.962 --> 01:51:57.203]  I mean, I don't see any other way for Ukraine right now.
[01:51:57.203 --> 01:51:59.063]  I mean, what independence is Ukraine going to have?
[01:52:00.649 --> 01:52:07.013]  Well, in fact, Ukraine has always had a phony nationalist as a president until Zelensky.
[01:52:07.013 --> 01:52:10.035]  Now, Zelensky is a corrupt individual, and corrupts are still rampant.
[01:52:10.035 --> 01:52:18.321]  Remember, unlike World War II, when we denazified all the nations, they never decommunized any of the countries that left the Soviet Union, right?
[01:52:18.321 --> 01:52:28.128]  Ukraine still had the same communist bureaucrats exacting bribes from the people, and that's what has given rise to so many revolutions, and the Maidan Revolution of 2014.
[01:52:28.128 --> 01:52:29.629]  As I told Alex Kerr back then,
[01:52:30.293 --> 01:52:33.195]  I said this was not a Western coup.
[01:52:33.195 --> 01:52:44.945]  This was a coup done by the Communist President Yanukovych, or Yanukovych, because he was the one who ordered the Berkut, the riot police, to stand down and let the protesters win.
[01:52:44.945 --> 01:52:49.069]  Now the Western people couldn't have told the Berkut to stand down.
[01:52:49.069 --> 01:52:52.952]  Even the presidential palace guards were left unattended.
[01:52:52.952 --> 01:52:57.315]  That's as if Trump rallies came on January 6th and the Marines had abandoned the White House.
[01:52:57.315 --> 01:52:58.857]  Would we have been responsible for that?
[01:52:59.702 --> 01:53:02.223]  Only the Democrats could have done that.
[01:53:02.223 --> 01:53:11.248]  So you see, there's a lot that conservatives don't know about the details of these things that I put out in the World Affairs Brief that really cloud my judgment.
[01:53:11.248 --> 01:53:24.995]  I am for the Ukrainian people not living under the phony communism that parades in Russia, but Russia is not the good guy, he's not the ally of the West, never will be, never has been, and you know, it's a sad
[01:53:26.233 --> 01:53:27.314]  Deception that people buy.
[01:53:27.314 --> 01:53:28.234]  I mean, look at his speech.
[01:53:28.234 --> 01:53:33.677]  He attacks the LBG and craziness of transgender in the West.
[01:53:33.677 --> 01:53:34.958]  Why does he do that?
[01:53:34.958 --> 01:53:36.278]  Because he's playing to the West.
[01:53:36.278 --> 01:53:40.240]  He knows that the conservatives... But Joel, I just, I can't buy into that.
[01:53:40.240 --> 01:53:40.841]  I'm sorry.
[01:53:40.841 --> 01:53:43.482]  If a man tells the truth, he tells the truth.
[01:53:43.482 --> 01:53:48.865]  I mean, if I'm going to sit here and say, oh, you're just saying that to play me, well then I'm never going to get anywhere.
[01:53:48.865 --> 01:53:52.126]  If everybody telling me the truth is out to get me, then how am I going to get anywhere?
[01:53:52.126 --> 01:53:53.187]  And how am I going to trust anybody?
[01:53:54.468 --> 01:53:59.810]  Well, you have to distinguish between those that have ulterior motives for telling the truth.
[01:53:59.810 --> 01:54:08.033]  Now, he's telling the truth about condemning Western, you know, pro-gay and pro-transgender policies, but you know, he's not the paragon of it.
[01:54:08.033 --> 01:54:10.154]  He's faking Christianity.
[01:54:10.154 --> 01:54:11.835]  Never been a Christian.
[01:54:11.835 --> 01:54:14.336]  You don't make Christians a KGB colonel.
[01:54:14.336 --> 01:54:16.757]  He knows about the phony fall of the Soviet Union.
[01:54:16.757 --> 01:54:23.159]  He's continuing it and playing the West because he knows that there are conservatives out there listening to him.
[01:54:23.945 --> 01:54:26.326]  Now, the globalists on the other hand... I don't think so, Joel.
[01:54:26.326 --> 01:54:39.389]  I gotta stop you right there, because I'm of this viewpoint that... I'm not gonna... People talking about communism as a threat out of Russia, or communism as a threat even out of China, falls on deaf ears to me.
[01:54:39.389 --> 01:54:40.929]  I've got communists here.
[01:54:40.929 --> 01:54:44.810]  Joe Biden just signed our sovereignty over to the World Health Organization.
[01:54:44.810 --> 01:54:46.950]  I'm dealing with communists in the West.
[01:54:46.950 --> 01:54:49.071]  I'm not dealing with communists coming from Russia.
[01:54:49.631 --> 01:54:51.052]  Oh, absolutely!
[01:54:51.052 --> 01:54:52.972]  I'm paying for illegal immigrants!
[01:54:52.972 --> 01:54:54.833]  I'm paying for people to live in the streets!
[01:54:54.833 --> 01:54:56.853]  What do you mean it's not communist?
[01:54:56.853 --> 01:54:58.234]  It's not communist.
[01:54:58.234 --> 01:54:59.194]  He's a globalist.
[01:54:59.194 --> 01:55:00.394]  He's a globalist puppet.
[01:55:00.394 --> 01:55:03.275]  And they don't care how much money he takes from China.
[01:55:03.275 --> 01:55:05.416]  They don't care how much money he takes from Ukraine.
[01:55:05.416 --> 01:55:07.457]  He doesn't even care if China thinks.
[01:55:07.457 --> 01:55:08.917]  They've got a handle on Joe Biden.
[01:55:08.917 --> 01:55:11.598]  He's a pure globalist puppet.
[01:55:11.598 --> 01:55:12.058]  And remember,
[01:55:12.631 --> 01:55:20.977]  The globalists, if you knew anything about history, of how the globalists have fomented communism and allowed it to rise, they brought China Mao Zedong to power.
[01:55:20.977 --> 01:55:24.980]  They brought the communists to power in Russia with 20 million dollars of gold.
[01:55:24.980 --> 01:55:28.223]  They cut off military aid to Chiang Kai-shek to bring Mao to power.
[01:55:28.223 --> 01:55:31.085]  They cut off military aid to Batista to bring communists.
[01:55:31.085 --> 01:55:35.168]  They cut off military aid to Somoza to bring communists.
[01:55:35.168 --> 01:55:37.229]  It doesn't mean they're communists.
[01:55:37.229 --> 01:55:39.291]  You've got to understand that the globalists
[01:55:39.893 --> 01:55:47.357]  Use communism to break down the social order so that they can come in with their milder form of W.F.
[01:55:47.357 --> 01:55:49.057]  Great Reset Socialism.
[01:55:49.057 --> 01:55:52.079]  But they're not communists, and you've got to understand that.
[01:55:52.079 --> 01:56:00.843]  So why do they want this war with Putin and Russia so badly if they're part of the controlled opposition to bring in the global government?
[01:56:00.843 --> 01:56:05.705]  Alright, now remember that prior to this change against Russia,
[01:56:06.403 --> 01:56:10.726]  The globalists have always been covering for Russia and covering for China.
[01:56:10.726 --> 01:56:12.767]  And believe me, China's ruthless in their comment.
[01:56:12.767 --> 01:56:18.470]  You apparently haven't listened to my interviews with Alex Jones about the danger of China, etc.
[01:56:18.470 --> 01:56:20.992]  But what I'm saying is the reason- Well, hold on a second!
[01:56:20.992 --> 01:56:24.714]  I'm the one that was threatened with the fact that Russia's teaming up with China instead of America!
[01:56:27.165 --> 01:56:28.807]  What did you just say?
[01:56:28.807 --> 01:56:37.294]  I'm concerned that the Western elites are pushing Russia into the arms of the Communist Chinese instead of having a partnership with us.
[01:56:37.294 --> 01:56:39.076]  That is my concern.
[01:56:39.076 --> 01:56:40.537]  They're not pushing him yet.
[01:56:40.537 --> 01:56:42.379]  He's always been an ally of China.
[01:56:42.379 --> 01:56:44.781]  He's never been an ally of the West and never will be.
[01:56:44.781 --> 01:56:48.845]  I mean, where do you get this?
[01:56:48.845 --> 01:56:53.089]  I'm saying it's not happening because the West doesn't want it.
[01:56:56.745 --> 01:57:01.087]  The West is not interested in having a good relationship with Russia, clearly.
[01:57:01.087 --> 01:57:03.448]  And I think that's a mistake.
[01:57:03.448 --> 01:57:08.730]  Because now they're going to have a better relationship with China, and now China's going to arm them in Ukraine.
[01:57:08.730 --> 01:57:14.252]  Well, it's not possible to ever deal with a deceptive government like Russia and claim that they're ever going to be.
[01:57:14.252 --> 01:57:15.492]  And the globalists know that.
[01:57:15.492 --> 01:57:16.873]  They've been covering for Russia.
[01:57:17.697 --> 01:57:21.259]  And the phony fall of the Soviet Union, specifically because they've been building it.
[01:57:21.259 --> 01:57:24.922]  They want Russia and China to attack the United States someday.
[01:57:24.922 --> 01:57:28.464]  It won't happen over Ukraine, but they have been building for this.
[01:57:28.464 --> 01:57:30.586]  That's what PDD 60 is all about.
[01:57:30.586 --> 01:57:34.608]  The Presidential Decision Directive 60 that tells us... Well, I agree.
[01:57:34.608 --> 01:57:35.709]  The globalists want us at war.
[01:57:35.709 --> 01:57:36.970]  We gotta take a break here, Joel.
[01:57:36.970 --> 01:57:39.171]  Come back in the next... It's a 90-second break.
[01:57:39.171 --> 01:57:41.633]  I agree the globalists want us at war.
[01:57:41.633 --> 01:57:43.614]  I'm not disagreeing with that.
[01:57:43.614 --> 01:57:47.217]  And I'm saying they're making it worse right now by funding this war in Ukraine.
[01:57:49.098 --> 01:57:57.303]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic book that documents the Globals in their own words, planned for our future.
[01:57:57.303 --> 01:57:58.764]  That is a hellish future.
[01:57:58.764 --> 01:58:08.170]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or Infowarshore.com.
[01:58:08.170 --> 01:58:13.754]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[01:58:13.754 --> 01:58:15.735]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[01:58:16.315 --> 01:58:21.697]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy, at Infowarsware.com.
[01:58:21.697 --> 01:58:25.638]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[01:58:25.638 --> 01:58:31.540]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you help keep InfoWars on the air.
[01:58:31.540 --> 01:58:33.621]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book.
[01:58:34.401 --> 01:58:35.461]  Or unsigned copies.
[01:58:35.461 --> 01:58:45.825]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowarshore.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library or give them to the local school.
[01:58:45.825 --> 01:58:46.845]  This is an Infowar.
[01:58:46.845 --> 01:58:48.745]  I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[01:58:48.745 --> 01:58:49.686]  I've got some good news.
[01:58:50.726 --> 01:58:57.608]  Our high-quality supplements really work, and we have about an 80% reorder rate with customers.
[01:58:57.608 --> 01:58:58.428]  That's the good news.
[01:58:58.428 --> 01:58:59.569]  They're amazing.
[01:58:59.569 --> 01:59:07.751]  The bad news is, around 1% or a little less of our actual viewers and listeners ever go to InfoWareStore.com and ever actually buy the products.
[01:59:07.751 --> 01:59:11.192]  So you're missing out on these products, plus it funds the InfoWare.
[01:59:11.192 --> 01:59:16.114]  Think of what we've done with just 1% of our massive audience actually buying products.
[01:59:16.114 --> 01:59:16.954]  Think what would happen.
[01:59:17.874 --> 01:59:31.423]  If those of you on the fence actually went to InfoWarStore.com and got some of these amazing products, I would recommend Turmeric 95 for your joints, your bones, inflammation, to get one of the biggest effects, so you reorder it and see how great it is.
[01:59:31.423 --> 01:59:40.389]  Also, we've got the super high-quality, full-spectrum CBD oil that's so good for your neurological systems, your brain, your joints, your bones, as well.
[01:59:40.389 --> 01:59:41.750]  Or Real Red Pill Plus.
[01:59:41.750 --> 01:59:46.193]  Just go try the product, fund the InfoWar, and help us defeat the new order together.
[01:59:46.193 --> 01:59:47.454]  InfoWarStore.com.
[01:59:47.694 --> 01:59:48.314]  Let's go!
[02:00:22.499 --> 02:00:28.024]  They move the doomsday clock up every time there's more saber rattling.
[02:00:28.024 --> 02:00:38.072]  And Joe Biden goes to Ukraine, they sound the air raid sirens just for a war propaganda effort.
[02:00:38.072 --> 02:00:41.275]  And so, none of this is good.
[02:00:41.275 --> 02:00:45.338]  And that's what I think is so sad, is that nobody is calling for peace.
[02:00:45.338 --> 02:00:49.762]  I don't see anybody calling for peace, except Donald Trump and I've seen Vladimir Putin at times.
[02:00:50.652 --> 02:00:55.697]  So, Joel, you can continue on your point, but let me ask you this question.
[02:00:55.697 --> 02:01:01.281]  Where is any effort from anywhere in the world to try to have a peaceful resolution to this?
[02:01:01.281 --> 02:01:04.724]  I'm really not seeing that anywhere.
[02:01:04.724 --> 02:01:10.650]  Well, there is no peaceful resolution when you have a planned aggression that was planned 20 years ago.
[02:01:10.650 --> 02:01:15.894]  These Russians are long-term conspiratorial planners.
[02:01:15.894 --> 02:01:17.316]  They planned the phony fall.
[02:01:18.240 --> 02:01:23.662]  You know, haven't you heard of Golitsyn's book predicting this, that they were going to fake their own demise?
[02:01:23.662 --> 02:01:27.524]  I mean, you've even sold that on Infowars.com, and you haven't read it.
[02:01:27.524 --> 02:01:28.544]  It's very, very real.
[02:01:28.544 --> 02:01:30.285]  Well, we don't have a one-train thought here.
[02:01:30.285 --> 02:01:32.546]  We have diverse thought here, Joel.
[02:01:32.546 --> 02:01:33.026]  Well, no.
[02:01:33.026 --> 02:01:35.667]  Let me explain the bigger picture.
[02:01:35.667 --> 02:01:38.708]  Now, remember, and I've documented this for tens of years.
[02:01:38.708 --> 02:01:47.712]  I've been writing the World Affairs brief since the year 2000, and it's all in the briefs about how the globalists have been building Russia and China, and they need one more war.
[02:01:48.567 --> 02:01:50.508]  We've had two wars so far.
[02:01:50.508 --> 02:01:54.491]  First World War tried to get us the League of Nations, their global government, didn't work.
[02:01:54.491 --> 02:01:56.552]  World War II got us the UN, but no power.
[02:01:56.552 --> 02:01:58.613]  No military power, no regulatory power.
[02:01:58.613 --> 02:02:03.857]  So they need one more war to get us into their vaunted New World Order.
[02:02:03.857 --> 02:02:07.619]  And it's not going to happen voluntarily.
[02:02:07.619 --> 02:02:09.600]  The US is not going to go into the WF.
[02:02:09.600 --> 02:02:13.803]  I'm not going to go into, you know, you own nothing and are happy, etc.
[02:02:13.803 --> 02:02:14.963]  So they need one more war.
[02:02:14.963 --> 02:02:17.385]  And that's why they've been building Russia and China for the war.
[02:02:18.949 --> 02:02:30.536]  And knowing, you know, that the Communists faked their own demise, you know, in Russia, but they let that pass because they want to be able to give, excuse, giving aid and trade to Russia.
[02:02:30.536 --> 02:02:41.983]  But they had to switch sides before, as the war got close, they had to start attacking Russia, and then China later on, so that they don't get blamed for having built these two enemies.
[02:02:41.983 --> 02:02:46.606]  Now, they had to start attacking Russia earlier because Donald Trump won the election despite their
[02:02:47.202 --> 02:02:50.123]  Fraudulent elections stuff.
[02:02:50.123 --> 02:02:57.864]  And that's why they turned early on Russia, because they wanted to blame Trump for collusion with Russia.
[02:02:57.864 --> 02:02:59.525]  And they've continued that ever since.
[02:02:59.525 --> 02:03:01.665]  But that means the war is getting close.
[02:03:01.665 --> 02:03:07.727]  They have to, you know, attack Russia for what it is.
[02:03:07.727 --> 02:03:09.607]  And it really was an aggressor in there.
[02:03:09.607 --> 02:03:11.888]  That doesn't mean that, you know, Ukraine's a good guy.
[02:03:11.888 --> 02:03:13.808]  The people don't deserve to live under that.
[02:03:14.764 --> 02:03:23.306]  But that's why they signed PDD-60 many years ago, that our nuclear forces would have to absorb a nuclear first strike and retaliate afterwards.
[02:03:23.306 --> 02:03:43.492]  Because that's the way that you get America into a global government, is that you get Russian-China, a suitable provocation, a big trigger event, North Korea or Taiwan, to nuke United States military forces, and then come out of their bunkers and say to American people, now we have to join in a militarized global government to win this war.
[02:03:44.614 --> 02:03:47.135]  They won't get it without that.
[02:03:47.135 --> 02:03:50.777]  I don't think, as I've explained, that Ukraine is that target.
[02:03:50.777 --> 02:03:58.860]  The purpose of it is to weaken Russia, to force it to join with China in the attack on the U.S.
[02:03:58.860 --> 02:04:05.163]  because Russia doesn't have the conventional forces to do a war by itself against the U.S.
[02:04:05.163 --> 02:04:07.624]  It needs China's massive conventional forces.
[02:04:08.502 --> 02:04:13.505]  Combined with Russia's massive nuclear forces to do this coming World War III attack.
[02:04:13.505 --> 02:04:15.166]  And it's not going to happen imminently.
[02:04:15.166 --> 02:04:17.308]  It's going to probably come.
[02:04:17.308 --> 02:04:22.531]  Because China isn't ready yet.
[02:04:22.531 --> 02:04:25.052]  So what is the correct foreign policy to have on Ukraine?
[02:04:25.052 --> 02:04:26.593]  Because to me it should be hands-off.
[02:04:26.593 --> 02:04:27.694]  Stop funding it.
[02:04:27.694 --> 02:04:28.975]  Stop sending weapons into it.
[02:04:31.149 --> 02:04:32.030]  No, not at all.
[02:04:32.030 --> 02:04:35.872]  Why would you let Russia reconstitute the Soviet Union?
[02:04:35.872 --> 02:04:38.654]  So are you anti-World War III or pro-war with Russia?
[02:04:38.654 --> 02:04:41.196]  I'm confused.
[02:04:41.196 --> 02:04:51.562]  I'm saying it's inevitable that we're going to have war because Russia and China have always intended to attack the West.
[02:04:51.562 --> 02:04:55.445]  I mean, that is primary 101.
[02:04:55.445 --> 02:04:58.267]  Anybody who's studied history about, you know, the Russians...
[02:04:59.158 --> 02:05:07.362]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic book that documents the globalists in their own words, planned for our future.
[02:05:07.362 --> 02:05:08.823]  That is a hellish future.
[02:05:08.823 --> 02:05:17.728]  Now, you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or Infowarsware.com.
[02:05:18.228 --> 02:05:23.813]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[02:05:23.813 --> 02:05:26.395]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[02:05:26.395 --> 02:05:31.779]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy, at InfoWarshaw.com.
[02:05:31.779 --> 02:05:35.722]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[02:05:35.722 --> 02:05:41.607]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you help keep InfoWars on the air.
[02:05:41.607 --> 02:05:43.689]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book.
[02:05:44.429 --> 02:05:45.030]  We're good to go.
[02:06:01.857 --> 02:06:07.338]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Owen Troyer.
[02:06:07.338 --> 02:06:11.179]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:11.179 --> 02:06:15.180]  Well, I believe, or I'd like to believe, we can stop World War III.
[02:06:15.180 --> 02:06:25.583]  And I certainly think putting more arms and weapons and funding into Ukraine is not stopping it, but my guest with me for one more segment, Joel, says it's inevitable.
[02:06:25.583 --> 02:06:31.484]  So, okay, World War III is inevitable, Joel, so I guess it's time for people to just get to their bunkers, or what?
[02:06:32.924 --> 02:06:36.926]  Well, we don't use the B word, you know, that gets tracked by the Deep State.
[02:06:36.926 --> 02:06:39.627]  But people do need fallout shelters because this war is going to happen.
[02:06:39.627 --> 02:06:40.667]  Why is it going to happen?
[02:06:40.667 --> 02:06:43.229]  Because Russia wants it, China wants it, and the U.S.
[02:06:43.229 --> 02:06:44.849]  globalists want it.
[02:06:44.849 --> 02:06:49.791]  They want it because they all want to control their own version of the New World Order.
[02:06:49.791 --> 02:06:57.175]  Now, I'll tell you, Russia and China are in temporary alliance, but Russia knows that China is the big threat to it after they take down the West.
[02:06:57.175 --> 02:07:00.096]  And that's why they stopped giving military technology to China.
[02:07:00.615 --> 02:07:04.096]  They fear China because China's become expert at stealing U.S.
[02:07:04.096 --> 02:07:04.516]  technology.
[02:07:04.516 --> 02:07:11.118]  They don't need Russia anymore, and they're ahead of Russia in certain regards, especially about the global Navy.
[02:07:11.118 --> 02:07:11.719]  Even the U.S.
[02:07:11.719 --> 02:07:16.620]  Navy's concerned that China is building us.
[02:07:16.620 --> 02:07:28.224]  I mean, China had their own deception of faking the type of capitalism or moderation, but they did it to get aid and trade so they could build up their military, which they never could have done.
[02:07:28.775 --> 02:07:40.304]  Had we not given them World Trade Organization status and opened up our borders to trade, and now we're totally dependent on China, and we can't even sanction them without hurting ourselves, unlike Russia.
[02:07:40.304 --> 02:07:48.471]  So the globalists have put us in a fix, but there is no way to avoid this war, because all three major conspiratorial powers want it.
[02:07:48.471 --> 02:07:50.933]  And it's going to happen, but it's not going to happen over Ukraine.
[02:07:50.933 --> 02:07:54.476]  And I'll tell you, the globalists know what they're doing in this sense.
[02:07:54.476 --> 02:07:57.058]  Now, I've been against globalist intervention all my career.
[02:07:57.836 --> 02:08:07.061]  But I knew that the Gaullists would switch sides and start to attack Russia and China prior to the war so they wouldn't get blamed for it.
[02:08:07.061 --> 02:08:15.186]  And they are weakening Russia conventionally so that it makes sure that there isn't a nuclear war until it's a massive strike.
[02:08:15.186 --> 02:08:18.448]  They want the strike to take down the entire U.S.
[02:08:18.448 --> 02:08:24.471]  military and our missiles so that we have no choice but to join their militarized global government.
[02:08:25.054 --> 02:08:30.999]  I mean, I know it may seem fantastic to you, but that's what they've been planning for many, many years.
[02:08:30.999 --> 02:08:32.440]  Doesn't sound fantastic to me at all.
[02:08:32.440 --> 02:08:34.181]  I totally understand the concept.
[02:08:34.181 --> 02:08:35.742]  I just believe we can stop it.
[02:08:35.742 --> 02:08:38.584]  I don't think America has to support this war.
[02:08:38.584 --> 02:08:42.727]  And I think when we had Donald Trump in there, things were a little better.
[02:08:42.727 --> 02:08:47.271]  And I do think, we may disagree on this, I do think Putin is willing to negotiate.
[02:08:47.751 --> 02:08:54.415]  I do believe Putin is willing to negotiate or have better relations with the West if he can trust the people he's negotiating with.
[02:08:54.415 --> 02:08:55.615]  He doesn't trust Joe Biden.
[02:08:55.615 --> 02:08:56.516]  Nobody does.
[02:08:56.516 --> 02:09:09.343]  I think he trusted Donald Trump enough not to invade Ukraine because I think Donald Trump was trustworthy enough when he said, I don't want to fund NATO, and I don't want NATO expansion, that Putin trusted him enough to say, fine, we won't go further into Ukraine.
[02:09:10.083 --> 02:09:12.765]  So, I just do believe there's a way to stop this.
[02:09:12.765 --> 02:09:18.929]  I'd like to think there's a way to stop this, but again, I mean, if there's not a way to stop it, so the conjecture is pointless here.
[02:09:18.929 --> 02:09:21.691]  It's time to just tell people to prepare, right?
[02:09:21.691 --> 02:09:22.972]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:09:22.972 --> 02:09:39.664]  But you see, your whole premise is based on denial of the issue of the floating fall of the Soviet Union and the lies and the deception of Putin presenting himself as pro-Western, pro-Christian, pro-sanity of the, you know, it's just a lie.
[02:09:40.402 --> 02:09:48.305]  I mean, if you want me to go through the evidence of the phony fall, because you obviously don't, you know, aren't aware of it, it's very, very real.
[02:09:48.305 --> 02:09:57.649]  And if it's a phony fall, that means you cannot trust Russia to say what they're saying publicly, because they're masters of deception.
[02:09:57.649 --> 02:10:09.234]  So Russia's run a gambit for two decades, and the Russian Orthodox Church gaining popularity, and the not embracing the Western perversion of sex and the family, it's all fake?
[02:10:10.256 --> 02:10:10.897]  Yeah, it is.
[02:10:10.897 --> 02:10:12.318]  And I'll tell you why.
[02:10:12.318 --> 02:10:14.459]  Russia is a corrupt country.
[02:10:14.459 --> 02:10:17.701]  Bribery, corruption, divorce, alcoholism are rampant.
[02:10:17.701 --> 02:10:19.262]  Are you talking about the United States?
[02:10:19.262 --> 02:10:21.444]  I was talking about Russia.
[02:10:21.444 --> 02:10:24.346]  I'm talking about Russia and don't be snide with me.
[02:10:24.346 --> 02:10:32.332]  What I'm saying is, I'm saying that it is corrupt and if you haven't lived there or talked to Russians or seen them, you don't know the kind of corruption there.
[02:10:32.332 --> 02:10:34.734]  Now, I'm not saying that, that the U.S.
[02:10:34.734 --> 02:10:35.554]  is not corrupt.
[02:10:35.554 --> 02:10:36.575]  I am a great critic.
[02:10:37.336 --> 02:10:40.078]  Of what is happening in the idiocy of the United States.
[02:10:40.078 --> 02:10:45.442]  But that's the purpose of the goal, was to dumb down our morals and dumb down our judgment, etc.
[02:10:45.442 --> 02:10:50.045]  But it is the Russians, and that's why they're not promoting homosexuality and transgenderism.
[02:10:50.045 --> 02:10:56.390]  They want some kind of strength in their people for war purposes that they know is coming and are planning on it.
[02:10:56.390 --> 02:10:59.152]  And Ukraine is part of that.
[02:10:59.152 --> 02:11:01.874]  Yeah, and China's doing the same thing.
[02:11:01.874 --> 02:11:02.334]  That's right.
[02:11:03.806 --> 02:11:08.750]  China is, you know, this military that they're building is not for defensive purposes.
[02:11:08.750 --> 02:11:13.695]  If you think that China is going to be our friend, look, Donald Trump didn't know anything.
[02:11:13.695 --> 02:11:22.623]  You know, Donald Trump never got a, you know, doesn't do any research, doesn't know conspiracy, doesn't know how to choose someone who's not deep state to be in administration.
[02:11:22.623 --> 02:11:25.025]  He doesn't understand the phony fall of the Soviet Union.
[02:11:26.034 --> 02:11:30.077]  That's why he thinks Putin can be a friend, but Donald Trump is angry about it.
[02:11:30.077 --> 02:11:40.063]  Well, Trump, you know, Trump made plenty of anti-Putin statements, but okay, if we're getting to the point of World War III being inevitable, well then what good does funding Ukraine or arming Ukraine do?
[02:11:40.063 --> 02:11:40.944]  Why would we be doing that?
[02:11:40.944 --> 02:11:42.785]  We should be girding ourselves for a war.
[02:11:42.785 --> 02:11:44.946]  I've explained it already to you.
[02:11:44.946 --> 02:11:49.649]  It weakens Russia conventionally so that they cannot... But it weakens us.
[02:11:49.649 --> 02:11:50.450]  It weakens us too.
[02:11:53.328 --> 02:12:00.776]  Well, we are using up weapons, but we're building up military weapons capacity as we speak, and I covered that in last week's World Affairs Brief.
[02:12:00.776 --> 02:12:06.082]  And a lot of this stuff is happening under the table without public acknowledgment.
[02:12:06.082 --> 02:12:13.229]  But weapons manufacturing are gearing up all over the West, including in Europe, because they know that they're drawing down on weapons.
[02:12:13.229 --> 02:12:13.890]  But they feel
[02:12:15.069 --> 02:12:25.017]  And if you know that Russia's an inevitable enemy on this thing, it is beneficial to weaken it in terms of its conventional capability.
[02:12:25.017 --> 02:12:29.741]  Because remember, that does force Russia to wait upon China before they can strike.
[02:12:29.741 --> 02:12:31.402]  They have to wait for China.
[02:12:31.402 --> 02:12:34.064]  And that gives us more time to prepare.
[02:12:34.064 --> 02:12:40.710]  Do you agree with Seymour Hersh reporting that it was the Biden administration that blew up the Nord Stream 2 pipeline?
[02:12:41.784 --> 02:12:45.949]  Absolutely, except for the disinformation that Biden was intimately involved in it.
[02:12:45.949 --> 02:12:48.692]  They don't let Biden know about secret operations.
[02:12:48.692 --> 02:12:51.536]  He's too much of a loose cannon.
[02:12:51.536 --> 02:12:52.697]  That was disinformation.
[02:12:52.697 --> 02:12:54.680]  Do you think Newland was directly involved in it?
[02:12:56.417 --> 02:12:58.077]  I don't know.
[02:12:58.077 --> 02:13:00.198]  You know, it's very possible she's a globalist.
[02:13:00.198 --> 02:13:03.338]  She's a very evil person.
[02:13:03.338 --> 02:13:07.599]  I do believe they use sonobuoy technology, but not normal sonobuoys.
[02:13:07.599 --> 02:13:15.021]  You have to have a specially designed sonobuoy that can give out digital messages instead of just a frequency to ping off of.
[02:13:15.021 --> 02:13:21.922]  So there was some problems with reporting, but yes, I said in the World Affairs Brief months before, this could only have been a U.S.
[02:13:21.922 --> 02:13:24.703]  operation because we had the technology to do that remotely.
[02:13:25.939 --> 02:13:30.560]  Now, I agree that Taiwan is the next piece to get moved in the larger geopolitical picture.
[02:13:30.560 --> 02:13:36.701]  When do you see the situation in Taiwan and the struggle between the West and China happening there?
[02:13:36.701 --> 02:13:43.863]  Well, China has been planning, in fact, planned to attack Taiwan as early as November of last year.
[02:13:43.863 --> 02:13:49.044]  But Biden destabilized that by mistakenly telling the Chinese that we would defend the military.
[02:13:49.044 --> 02:13:51.044]  And, you know, the White House corrected Biden in it.
[02:13:51.044 --> 02:13:52.104]  He was like a loose cannon.
[02:13:52.104 --> 02:13:55.005]  No, no, that's not our policy to defend Taiwan.
[02:13:55.700 --> 02:13:58.041]  But it destabilized China enough that they delayed.
[02:13:58.041 --> 02:14:04.145]  Now we've destabilized it again by putting in 100 to 200 advisors into Taiwan.
[02:14:04.145 --> 02:14:10.588]  So now we've got American troops on the line in there, which means that that's a trigger event, potentially.
[02:14:10.588 --> 02:14:15.591]  It's not as big a trigger event as South Korea, where we have 27,000 troops.
[02:14:15.591 --> 02:14:20.013]  We must intervene if North Korea is a puppet of China attacks North Korea.
[02:14:21.809 --> 02:14:32.059]  We didn't necessarily have to attack if China attacked Taiwan, but now we may have to because if we put troops in there, we've got blood on the line, you know, in the game.
[02:14:32.059 --> 02:14:35.462]  And so that makes Taiwan a particularly trigger event.
[02:14:35.462 --> 02:14:36.483]  So what does that mean?
[02:14:36.483 --> 02:14:40.807]  It means that Taiwan will be spared probably a Chinese invasion.
[02:14:41.343 --> 02:14:48.406]  Until later, because China knows that if it's a trigger event for World War III, we don't attack Taiwan until we're ready for World War III.
[02:14:48.406 --> 02:14:51.487]  And that won't happen until the latter half of this decade.
[02:14:51.487 --> 02:14:55.169]  Even China admits we won't be a first-class military power until 2027.
[02:14:57.492 --> 02:15:01.353]  Well, call me a dreamer, Joel, but I'd like to believe we can stop World War III.
[02:15:01.353 --> 02:15:05.194]  But, folks, you might want to get prepared in case we can't.
[02:15:05.194 --> 02:15:07.155]  And, Joel, obviously, I respect you.
[02:15:07.155 --> 02:15:10.956]  It's okay for us to disagree, and it makes for great talk radio.
[02:15:10.956 --> 02:15:12.957]  This was a great last hour with you, Joel.
[02:15:12.957 --> 02:15:13.737]  I really enjoyed it.
[02:15:13.737 --> 02:15:15.238]  Thank you for joining us today.
[02:15:15.238 --> 02:15:15.738]  It was.
[02:15:15.738 --> 02:15:16.818]  Thank you very much, Owen.
[02:15:16.818 --> 02:15:18.539]  All right, there goes Joel Skousen.
[02:15:18.539 --> 02:15:21.880]  Man, you know, that's old-school talk radio right there.
[02:15:21.880 --> 02:15:22.600]  That's nice.
[02:15:22.600 --> 02:15:23.780]  I like that.
[02:15:23.780 --> 02:15:26.121]  Okay, now, as we enter
[02:15:27.677 --> 02:15:32.500]  This next break, Chris Sky is set to join me on the other side.

[02:15:52.732 --> 02:15:54.493]  They think he's hiding assets in his cat.
[02:15:58.493 --> 02:16:06.937]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars has proven itself in the last 28 years to be over the globalist target and having the biggest effect out there against those tyrants.

[02:16:58.393 --> 02:17:11.070]  Every time I talk to you, you're either, like, on the border, exposing the cartels, and, like, coming under fire, or you're on the streets of some American city, hanging out with drug addicts and criminals, and now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill.
[02:17:11.070 --> 02:17:12.852]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah?
[02:17:12.852 --> 02:17:14.595]  Have you ever considered that for a second?
[02:17:15.006 --> 02:17:17.808]  Now I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans.
[02:17:17.808 --> 02:17:19.529]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth.
[02:17:19.529 --> 02:17:22.031]  And again, you know, I have InfoWars to thank for that.
[02:17:22.031 --> 02:17:26.394]  Looking back on the day, I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions.
[02:17:26.394 --> 02:17:32.098]  I was so grateful because, you know, I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and under the InfoWars team.
[02:17:32.098 --> 02:17:37.102]  And I really do credit that as to why I'm able to, you know, get these types of clips.
[02:17:37.102 --> 02:17:40.244]  Because Alex's whole mentality was, you know, go where the
[02:17:40.384 --> 02:17:40.844]  I don't know.
[02:18:00.180 --> 02:18:09.891]  Humanity is in a fight for its very life, and InfoWars, for decades, has been at the very forefront of the fight for a pro-human future.

[02:18:49.224 --> 02:18:51.651]  In the last month, I got a little busy, so I didn't sign the books.
[02:18:51.651 --> 02:18:52.554]  We didn't have them for sale.
[02:18:52.554 --> 02:18:54.119]  But now, I signed the last books.
[02:18:54.119 --> 02:18:54.801]  You can get them right now.
[02:19:00.535 --> 02:19:05.178]  It's hard to believe that we're already going into March 2023.
[02:19:05.178 --> 02:19:06.939]  And the world is an insane place.
[02:19:06.939 --> 02:19:08.700]  World War III has already started.
[02:19:08.700 --> 02:19:11.022]  Biden is a puppet and is dissolving our borders.
[02:19:11.022 --> 02:19:12.182]  There's mass censorship.
[02:19:12.182 --> 02:19:14.384]  James O'Keefe's been removed from Project Veritas.
[02:19:14.384 --> 02:19:16.645]  The list goes on and on of the bad things that are happening.
[02:19:16.645 --> 02:19:21.128]  But the good things that are happening is humanity is really accelerating its awakening.
[02:19:21.288 --> 02:19:25.229]  But those of us on the forefront are under more attack by the establishment than ever.
[02:19:25.229 --> 02:19:33.651]  That's why I'm counting on you to spread the word about the broadcast, to pray for the broadcast, and to keep the broadcast on the air by getting great products at InfoWarshaw.com.

[02:19:59.184 --> 02:20:05.089]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:24.229 --> 02:20:26.811]  It's hard to turn that off.
[02:20:26.811 --> 02:20:29.073]  I see even my guest, he's got his head nod to that.
[02:20:29.073 --> 02:20:30.355]  That's just good stuff right there.
[02:20:30.355 --> 02:20:32.276]  I don't care where you're from.
[02:20:32.276 --> 02:20:36.680]  I don't care where you're from.
[02:20:36.680 --> 02:20:39.863]  That's just good stuff.
[02:20:39.863 --> 02:20:41.485]  That's just good, clean living right there.
[02:20:41.485 --> 02:20:45.048]  Alright, Chris Skye is my guest here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:45.048 --> 02:20:45.889]  Owen Schroer filling in.
[02:20:48.747 --> 02:20:58.430]  And well, Chris, I mean, it's funny because the video, the original video that you recorded probably more than two years ago now.
[02:20:58.430 --> 02:21:04.092]  I mean, it's crazy to think, but I think it was more than two years ago now and it still gets shared online.
[02:21:04.092 --> 02:21:04.252]  Right.
[02:21:04.252 --> 02:21:05.833]  And people are like, oh, my gosh, like, oh.
[02:21:06.833 --> 02:21:07.995]  How did he know?
[02:21:07.995 --> 02:21:11.178]  And they might not even realize how old the video is.
[02:21:11.178 --> 02:21:17.706]  But it's incredible, just by speaking the truth, how prophetic one can turn out to be.
[02:21:17.706 --> 02:21:19.448]  But you knew what was going on.
[02:21:19.448 --> 02:21:20.869]  You called it from a mile away.
[02:21:21.830 --> 02:21:25.972]  And so, you've been around the world now, also talking about this.
[02:21:25.972 --> 02:21:28.253]  Now, there's a bunch of different stuff to talk about.
[02:21:28.253 --> 02:21:35.175]  I know you've got some personal news I think you want to talk about with some political stuff that you're involved in.
[02:21:35.175 --> 02:21:39.477]  But where does the attitude lie in Canada right now?
[02:21:39.477 --> 02:21:40.977]  What is the feeling in Canada?
[02:21:40.977 --> 02:21:43.098]  You know, you guys went through a lot.
[02:21:43.098 --> 02:21:47.300]  You had the strike, you had the protests, you had the farmers.
[02:21:48.240 --> 02:21:50.902]  And you still got Trudeau in there.
[02:21:50.902 --> 02:21:58.788]  But what's the attitude of Canadians now, a few years removed from the lockdowns and the protests?
[02:21:58.788 --> 02:22:01.710]  Are the moods getting better politically?
[02:22:01.710 --> 02:22:03.111]  Is there more hope?
[02:22:03.111 --> 02:22:03.892]  What do you think?
[02:22:03.892 --> 02:22:04.773]  What's your analysis?
[02:22:06.172 --> 02:22:12.677]  Well, I think there's a big divide right now because even within the freedom movement, there's a lot of people that obviously they've been fighting for three years.
[02:22:12.677 --> 02:22:15.860]  So they really want to believe that everything's over, that everything's okay.
[02:22:15.860 --> 02:22:17.161]  They don't have to wear a mask anymore.
[02:22:17.161 --> 02:22:18.242]  Most mandates are gone.
[02:22:18.242 --> 02:22:19.383]  They can travel.
[02:22:19.383 --> 02:22:23.346]  So even the people within the freedom movement got complacent.
[02:22:23.346 --> 02:22:24.527]  And that's what the government wanted.
[02:22:24.527 --> 02:22:26.989]  The government wanted everybody to feel like everything was okay.
[02:22:26.989 --> 02:22:30.092]  But at the same time, everybody's still suffering from PTSD.
[02:22:30.592 --> 02:22:30.952]  We're good to go.
[02:22:47.379 --> 02:22:51.002]  And some people are just paralyzed and still can't come to terms with what happened.
[02:22:51.002 --> 02:22:53.084]  Some people don't want to believe what's happening.
[02:22:53.084 --> 02:23:01.230]  But now there's a majority, and it's growing all around the world, that are finally realizing what we've been trying to tell everybody from day one.
[02:23:01.230 --> 02:23:05.313]  COVID, climate change, has nothing to do with your health and safety.
[02:23:05.313 --> 02:23:08.595]  It's all about power and control, and it's all about controlling you.
[02:23:08.595 --> 02:23:15.681]  COVID was to get you used to the idea that you need to be controlled, and now climate change is the way to control you for generations to come.
[02:23:16.201 --> 02:23:22.734]  So, in my opinion, we're in a better place than we were obviously because we're more free, but at the same time...
[02:23:23.819 --> 02:23:30.401]  It's a scary time because it's almost like the calm before the storm because we know the people in the know know that they're not done with us.
[02:23:30.401 --> 02:23:32.382]  In fact, that was just the beginning.
[02:23:32.382 --> 02:23:36.804]  So when you look at it like that, it becomes almost overwhelming for a lot of people.
[02:23:36.804 --> 02:23:38.704]  So they don't want to see it that way.
[02:23:38.704 --> 02:23:42.886]  Everybody wants to believe that we're in like this greener pasture and everything's behind us.
[02:23:42.886 --> 02:23:43.646]  That's not the case.
[02:23:43.646 --> 02:23:47.227]  And we know that and it's the same thing with the war going on in Ukraine.
[02:23:47.227 --> 02:23:48.348]  They're keeping that.
[02:23:48.348 --> 02:23:49.828]  I know you guys want to talk about that too.
[02:23:49.828 --> 02:23:52.209]  So I got a lot to say about that if you want to move on to that.
[02:23:52.998 --> 02:24:10.735]  Well, and, you know, I kind of want to do a compare and contrast here between the United States and Canada before we do get into that, because the vaccines have been kind of a major awakening moment for Americans, and this is people that maybe didn't understand what you explained with
[02:24:11.235 --> 02:24:11.816]  We're good to go.
[02:24:36.716 --> 02:24:40.180]  Hey, this is in the best interest, in the best interest of the community.
[02:24:40.180 --> 02:24:44.685]  You know, I understand why, but then they, oh, this vaccine was not safe or effective.
[02:24:44.685 --> 02:24:48.670]  I got injected with two of them and now I'm concerned that I might not wake up tomorrow.
[02:24:48.670 --> 02:24:51.834]  That's been a big awakening point here in the United States.
[02:24:51.834 --> 02:24:53.696]  Is it a similar phenomenon in Canada?
[02:24:54.978 --> 02:24:59.301]  I believe you're 100% correct on that, and there is a similar effect in Canada.
[02:24:59.301 --> 02:25:03.023]  However, in Canada, I believe there's a lot more deniability going on.
[02:25:03.023 --> 02:25:11.529]  There's still a lot of people that are clinging to the idea that they still made the right choice, but you won't go see them putting a new vaccine selfie on Facebook or Instagram anytime.
[02:25:12.324 --> 02:25:22.168]  So to be honest, in my opinion, the number one adverse reaction to the vaccines all around the world universally is vaccine regret.
[02:25:22.168 --> 02:25:27.750]  The vast majority of people who took the vaccine know that they would have been better off without taking it.
[02:25:28.090 --> 02:25:28.490]  No, I don't.
[02:25:47.757 --> 02:25:50.459]  So I wouldn't want to live with that stress every day.
[02:25:50.459 --> 02:25:57.265]  So I know I know all these people are feeling right now because if I did something that I regretted every day for the rest of my life, it would weigh on me.
[02:25:57.265 --> 02:26:01.428]  So I think that's a very, very powerful weapon that we have.
[02:26:01.428 --> 02:26:04.150]  And it's a very good point that you made.
[02:26:04.150 --> 02:26:10.355]  And we need to harness that because that gives us the ability to expand our numbers way past the freedom movement.
[02:26:10.635 --> 02:26:16.418]  Before, we were just the fringe minority, the anti-vaxxers, the anti-maskers, the far-right extremists.
[02:26:16.418 --> 02:26:30.984]  But now, the same people that trusted the government, trusted the science, and went along with the system, realize that the system was designed to eat them alive, and realize that they were the prey the entire time, and realize that they can't trust the medical establishment, they can't trust the government,
[02:26:31.264 --> 02:26:34.005]  But they can't trust the so-called conspiracy theorists.
[02:26:34.005 --> 02:26:40.368]  So now, we have an ability to bring massive numbers of people into this movement.
[02:26:40.368 --> 02:26:44.069]  And this is truly a worldwide global movement.
[02:26:44.483 --> 02:26:48.707]  It transcends borders, it transcends language, it transcends religion.
[02:26:48.707 --> 02:26:51.930]  Freedom reigns supreme above all.
[02:26:51.930 --> 02:27:03.822]  And when we all want the same thing, freedom, and we're all united by the same thing, love, that's the only two things we need to be victorious 100% of the time.
[02:27:03.822 --> 02:27:07.706]  Well, and you know, I would say, you know, validation
[02:27:09.464 --> 02:27:11.065]  Is an important thing.
[02:27:11.065 --> 02:27:18.068]  And you know, people want to talk about, well, it's not about being right, or it's not about being vindicated.
[02:27:18.068 --> 02:27:19.028]  I would say, you know what?
[02:27:19.028 --> 02:27:20.209]  It is, actually.
[02:27:20.209 --> 02:27:21.189]  I'm a talk show host.
[02:27:21.189 --> 02:27:22.170]  I talk for a living.
[02:27:22.170 --> 02:27:22.890]  I influence people.
[02:27:22.890 --> 02:27:24.611]  I'm supposed to be telling you the truth.
[02:27:24.611 --> 02:27:28.112]  Vindication and being proven right is a big deal.
[02:27:28.112 --> 02:27:31.814]  It is actually, I would even argue, potentially everything.
[02:27:31.814 --> 02:27:33.655]  Because I'm somebody that likes to debate.
[02:27:34.395 --> 02:27:39.441]  And I like to put my worldview and my ideology up against somebody else's.
[02:27:39.441 --> 02:27:45.347]  And if I'm not right, and I'm not vindicated, and I'm not validated, well then my worldview is worthless.
[02:27:45.347 --> 02:27:49.531]  So no, us being vindicated in this sense is everything.
[02:27:49.531 --> 02:27:52.454]  And when I see the New York Times coming out with a story this week that says...
[02:27:53.396 --> 02:27:55.579]  Well, the anti-maskers were right.
[02:27:55.579 --> 02:27:57.763]  Well, the anti-vaxxers was right.
[02:27:57.763 --> 02:27:59.265]  Will we learn anything?
[02:27:59.265 --> 02:28:05.154]  Well, until you admit that we're right about everything, no, you won't learn anything.
[02:28:06.167 --> 02:28:15.413]  And until they stop, even when they're telling everybody they're right, they're still referring to you in the derogatory term of anti-vaxxer or anti-masker.
[02:28:15.413 --> 02:28:21.756]  So they're still literally trying to put a negative spin on what is really simply the truth.
[02:28:21.756 --> 02:28:28.961]  Everything you just said is basically getting down to what the truth is, and not the so-called science that they pay for.
[02:28:28.961 --> 02:28:31.022]  The truth is irrefutable.
[02:28:31.022 --> 02:28:32.403]  The truth is evidence.
[02:28:32.403 --> 02:28:34.584]  For instance, how is it that Canada
[02:28:35.342 --> 02:28:39.843]  Nation of 38 million had 75% of us vaccinated.
[02:28:39.843 --> 02:28:44.825]  We had the so-called pinnacle of the world global pandemic response.
[02:28:44.825 --> 02:28:47.606]  Meanwhile, we had 50,000 COVID deaths.
[02:28:47.606 --> 02:28:54.288]  Then you look at a little country like Haiti, which Donald Trump would probably refer to as a shithole.
[02:28:54.288 --> 02:28:54.788]  Hold it right there.
[02:28:54.788 --> 02:28:55.348]  We're in a burst.
[02:28:59.164 --> 02:29:11.095]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to InfoWarsaw.com and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body and keep us on air.

[02:29:47.289 --> 02:29:48.590]  So get off the bench.
[02:29:48.590 --> 02:29:49.430]  Get in the game.

[02:30:06.109 --> 02:30:11.414]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication, it takes commitment.

[02:30:44.171 --> 02:30:49.514]  You've been watching for years, you've been listening for years, but you've never taken the step to go to InfoWarsTore.
[02:30:49.514 --> 02:30:52.376]  These are great products that really work and are amazing.

[02:31:58.841 --> 02:32:02.865]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[02:32:02.865 --> 02:32:06.728]  A flying disc has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[02:32:06.728 --> 02:32:09.130]  Jerzy Bolton from PBS News.
[02:32:09.130 --> 02:32:11.972]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[02:32:11.972 --> 02:32:14.014]  This is a different kind of war.
[02:32:14.834 --> 02:32:19.295]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[02:32:19.295 --> 02:32:22.756]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[02:32:22.756 --> 02:32:26.717]  It took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[02:32:26.717 --> 02:32:29.338]  It was almost as if there were a plan in motion.
[02:32:29.338 --> 02:32:30.518]  It just can't end.
[02:32:30.518 --> 02:32:32.579]  We need to go into the capital, fast!
[02:32:34.646 --> 02:32:36.747]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[02:32:36.747 --> 02:32:38.388]  They are nothing but distractions.
[02:32:38.388 --> 02:32:40.590]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[02:32:40.590 --> 02:32:43.072]  You silenced those voices.
[02:32:43.072 --> 02:32:46.835]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[02:32:46.835 --> 02:32:53.240]  Soon as we start exposing the Great Reset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison!
[02:32:59.201 --> 02:33:05.111]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[02:33:12.552 --> 02:33:15.094]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:15.094 --> 02:33:20.759]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:33:20.759 --> 02:33:23.662]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:33:23.662 --> 02:33:37.254]  Alright, we've got the great Chris Skye with us here, and I normally wouldn't interrupt this guest, but I think, you know, Chris Skye is a lover of life, and so I think he'll actually appreciate this, and so we've got the hashtag Save Mooshu going.
[02:33:37.874 --> 02:33:44.416]  Because they want Alex's cat now as part of this fallout from the Sandy Hook litigation.
[02:33:44.416 --> 02:33:48.257]  They're questioning him and talking about the value of his cat.
[02:33:48.257 --> 02:33:52.218]  And so this is actually his daughter's cat that he got to his daughter.
[02:33:52.218 --> 02:33:53.879]  It's her first pet.
[02:33:53.879 --> 02:33:59.621]  And so anybody that can relate to having a pet or your kid's first pet knows this tugs at your heartstrings.
[02:33:59.621 --> 02:34:06.343]  And so here's Alex's daughter today sadly learning the news that they may be coming for her cat.
[02:34:06.343 --> 02:34:07.003]  And so here it is.
[02:34:18.066 --> 02:34:19.027]  So there you go folks.
[02:34:19.027 --> 02:34:23.170]  Hashtag Save Mooshu on Twitter is trending right now.

[02:34:34.037 --> 02:34:34.618]  Okay, fine.
[02:34:34.618 --> 02:34:38.319]  We'll use that as a little momentum to fund what we do here that you hate so much.
[02:34:38.319 --> 02:34:41.081]  Coupon code SaveMushu at checkout, 10% off.
[02:34:41.081 --> 02:34:44.303]  Now, Chris, you were getting into this at the end of the last segment, how
[02:34:45.339 --> 02:34:49.941]  Canada is, you know, Trudeau awarding himself, patting himself on the back.
[02:34:49.941 --> 02:34:53.242]  He's the greatest COVID dictator of all time.
[02:34:53.242 --> 02:34:58.663]  But you were getting into how, if you look at the data, maybe not so much.
[02:34:58.663 --> 02:35:02.565]  Yes, if you look at real world data, I just compared Haiti to Canada.
[02:35:02.565 --> 02:35:04.245]  Haiti is 11.8 million people.
[02:35:04.245 --> 02:35:06.846]  Canada's 37 million people.
[02:35:06.846 --> 02:35:09.347]  We had 75 percent of our population vaccinated.
[02:35:09.347 --> 02:35:14.969]  We have what they call a first world health care system and a first tier pandemic response.
[02:35:15.287 --> 02:35:18.148]  Haiti has one of the worst healthcare systems in the world.
[02:35:18.148 --> 02:35:21.909]  They had virtually a 10% vaccination rate for the country.
[02:35:21.909 --> 02:35:28.291]  But when you compare the COVID deaths, Canada had 50,000 and Haiti had around 900.
[02:35:28.291 --> 02:35:30.812]  So when you do the math, it doesn't really add up.
[02:35:30.812 --> 02:35:39.035]  And you can look at an entire continent like Africa, 54 countries, almost a billion and a half people, and they had the same vaccination rate, 10%.
[02:35:39.035 --> 02:35:43.177]  Yet they had less COVID deaths than you guys did in the United States with 330 million.
[02:35:43.177 --> 02:35:44.377]  So how does it make sense?
[02:35:44.987 --> 02:35:45.328]  Answer?
[02:35:45.328 --> 02:35:45.768]  It doesn't.
[02:35:45.768 --> 02:35:47.691]  And that's why truth matters.
[02:35:47.691 --> 02:35:52.296]  They want you to believe that truth doesn't matter unless they're telling you what they're telling you.
[02:35:52.296 --> 02:35:54.219]  And the only thing that matters is their truth.
[02:35:54.219 --> 02:35:57.623]  But there's no such thing as your truth, my truth, his truth, that truth.
[02:35:57.623 --> 02:35:59.485]  There's always only one truth.
[02:35:59.485 --> 02:36:00.827]  And that's why we look at data.
[02:36:01.187 --> 02:36:02.748]  Not so-called science.
[02:36:02.748 --> 02:36:03.868]  We look at data.
[02:36:03.868 --> 02:36:09.491]  And all around the world, all we know is the healthiest people in the world are the ones that never took the jabs.
[02:36:09.491 --> 02:36:13.113]  And the unhealthiest people in the world are the ones that took the most jabs.
[02:36:13.113 --> 02:36:14.293]  Four and five.
[02:36:14.293 --> 02:36:20.236]  And we also know that there's excess mortality all over the world as of 2021.
[02:36:20.236 --> 02:36:25.579]  And the only common denominator in all these countries was not COVID, it was the jab.
[02:36:25.579 --> 02:36:28.000]  It's obvious it was the biggest public health
[02:36:28.562 --> 02:36:29.543]  I don't think so.
[02:36:54.838 --> 02:37:04.261]  Test results back when it comes to females that have been vaccinated and what goes on in the process of having a child and everything with, you know, the female biology they claim doesn't exist.
[02:37:04.261 --> 02:37:06.722]  No, there's a female biology to have a child.
[02:37:06.722 --> 02:37:10.463]  And they're discussing the side effects from the vaccine, how it is affecting that.
[02:37:10.463 --> 02:37:12.024]  And there's some serious stuff.
[02:37:12.024 --> 02:37:16.265]  So like you said, we're still not really into the total fallout of the vaccine side effects.
[02:37:16.265 --> 02:37:19.826]  We might kind of be hitting that edge of really knowing where we're going pretty soon.
[02:37:19.826 --> 02:37:21.607]  But, you know, I'm sure you may be noticing this too.
[02:37:22.327 --> 02:37:24.589]  I know you spend a lot of time in the gym.
[02:37:24.589 --> 02:37:26.871]  I spend a lot of time in the gym as well.
[02:37:26.871 --> 02:37:31.376]  And what we've seen is athletes seeming to have the worst side effects from this.
[02:37:31.376 --> 02:37:32.897]  So many of them dropping dead.
[02:37:32.897 --> 02:37:35.900]  Football players, basketball players, young players.
[02:37:35.900 --> 02:37:44.088]  And I've actually seen a couple of instances at the gym where I go with other regulars who I'll talk to will play basketball or lift weights.
[02:37:44.648 --> 02:37:48.995]  And they've all, I've had like six, seven guys talk to me about vaccine side effects.
[02:37:48.995 --> 02:37:52.420]  A couple of them are now, they can't even work out because they're having heart problems.
[02:37:52.420 --> 02:37:54.424]  Have you heard about any of this, even firsthand?
[02:37:55.987 --> 02:37:57.969]  Come on, my number's public.
[02:37:57.969 --> 02:38:01.651]  All I get are people messaging me every day with their vaccine reactions.
[02:38:01.651 --> 02:38:13.481]  So I know so many people, young people, younger than me, great shape, myocarditis, pericarditis, blood clots, shortness of breath, seizures, paralysis on certain parts of their body.
[02:38:13.481 --> 02:38:15.002]  I've heard it all.
[02:38:15.482 --> 02:38:22.770]  I've heard horror stories about families being relocated by vaccine manufacturers after people close to them have been killed.
[02:38:22.770 --> 02:38:30.577]  I've heard horror stories of people becoming infertile from the vaccine and then being offered so-called clinical trials to try to get their fertility back.
[02:38:31.338 --> 02:38:37.881]  Every single possible side effect you can imagine is being manifested by these vaccines.
[02:38:37.881 --> 02:38:43.044]  Because what it does, is it basically manifests every individual's genetic weakness.
[02:38:43.044 --> 02:38:46.526]  So if you were going to get cancer when you're 70, now you're going to get it a lot sooner.
[02:38:46.526 --> 02:38:48.567]  If you were going to have liver failure, now it's going to happen.
[02:38:48.567 --> 02:38:51.348]  If you were going to have a heart attack, it might just happen tomorrow.
[02:38:51.348 --> 02:38:56.231]  And like you said, you're seeing it in people that are utilizing their athletics more than normal.
[02:38:56.531 --> 02:38:57.933]  And we're even seeing it in Hollywood.
[02:38:57.933 --> 02:39:06.782]  How many Hollywood actors now can no longer act because they have brain damage of some sort that they pretend like didn't have anything to do with the jabs that they were forced to take.
[02:39:06.782 --> 02:39:07.943]  It's ridiculous.
[02:39:07.943 --> 02:39:18.395]  It's like you said, the vast majority of Americans know, and Americans above anyone else in the world, when they find out someone screwed them over,
[02:39:19.133 --> 02:39:20.674]  There's going to be hell to pay.
[02:39:20.674 --> 02:39:26.499]  So I'm waiting for Phase 3 of United Non-Compliance to kick in and that's when we can hold these people accountable.
[02:39:26.499 --> 02:39:37.508]  And that's why I took the advantage of when John Tory got canned in Toronto, he was our mayor, to throw my hat into the ring for mayor because I have a massive amount of support
[02:39:37.708 --> 02:39:39.029]  Let's break that right now.
[02:39:39.029 --> 02:39:40.449]  I will introduce this.
[02:39:40.449 --> 02:39:41.750]  This is great news.
[02:39:41.750 --> 02:39:44.892]  And folks, this is where the rubber meets the road.
[02:39:44.892 --> 02:39:50.615]  It's everyday people taking action, getting into the arena, getting into the battlefield.
[02:39:50.615 --> 02:39:52.616]  This is what the globalists really hate.
[02:39:52.616 --> 02:39:56.698]  And so Chris, this is just such a great move from you.
[02:39:56.698 --> 02:39:57.618]  We salute you.
[02:39:57.618 --> 02:39:58.699]  We give you Godspeed.
[02:39:58.699 --> 02:39:59.459]  Tell people the news.
[02:40:02.405 --> 02:40:03.947]  It just so happened it fell in my lap.
[02:40:03.947 --> 02:40:07.531]  I was on my way to Toronto for the Worldwide Rally for February 18th.
[02:40:07.531 --> 02:40:10.994]  Three days before I went to Toronto, people started calling me saying, are you running for Mayor?
[02:40:10.994 --> 02:40:12.096]  I said, what are you talking about?
[02:40:12.096 --> 02:40:16.761]  They said, well John Tory was forced to resign and apparently you're trending for Mayor of Toronto.
[02:40:16.761 --> 02:40:22.687]  So I made a video joking about it and it went viral and I got a crazy amount of support.
[02:40:23.187 --> 02:40:25.790]  And everybody and their uncle was trying to tell me to run.
[02:40:25.790 --> 02:40:31.075]  And when I got into Toronto, the kicker for me was when I was in the hospital and this little girl asked me to run.
[02:40:31.075 --> 02:40:41.025]  And I just thought about all the times where on video I told people that I would do everything in my power to protect especially the children from this globalist agenda that I know is designed to hurt and destroy them.
[02:40:41.025 --> 02:40:44.048]  And I saw firsthand what it did to this little girl who's 15 years old.
[02:40:45.484 --> 02:40:56.690]  So at that point I decided if I can inject myself into a position where I'm directly between the NWO and the people they are trying to hurt, that's where I want to be.
[02:40:56.690 --> 02:40:58.511]  I want to be there to fight for the people.
[02:40:58.511 --> 02:41:00.192]  I want to be there to protect the people.
[02:41:00.192 --> 02:41:05.815]  I believe I've been doing it unofficially for the last three years, not even just in Canada, but virtually all around the world.
[02:41:06.875 --> 02:41:08.296]  I've put my skin in the game.
[02:41:08.296 --> 02:41:10.676]  I've been arrested 25 times.
[02:41:10.676 --> 02:41:12.137]  I've faced over 60 charges.
[02:41:12.137 --> 02:41:17.619]  I still have no criminal record, by the way, which goes to show you what all these charges are motivated by.
[02:41:17.619 --> 02:41:30.983]  And now that I am going to be an official candidate for mayor, as the mayor in Toronto, which is the crown jewel of the World Economic Forum agenda, Toronto and the Greater Toronto Area comprises 10 million people.
[02:41:31.403 --> 02:41:32.064]  We're good to go.
[02:41:53.118 --> 02:41:53.718]  We're good to go.
[02:42:20.538 --> 02:42:33.709]  Well, let's talk about that on the other side, because I think there's two phenomenons that we need to highlight when it comes to this, and that's that now is the time to stand up to tyranny, folks, when it's easy.
[02:42:33.709 --> 02:42:37.031]  Now's the time to do it when it's easy, but then also
[02:42:37.992 --> 02:42:39.153]  Well, okay, what do I do?
[02:42:39.153 --> 02:42:46.640]  Well, just like what Chris said, hey, maybe doing a talk show is not for everybody, maybe running for office isn't for everybody, but there's something out there.
[02:42:46.640 --> 02:42:49.263]  You can become a thorn in the globalist's side.
[02:42:49.263 --> 02:42:53.747]  You can become a stick in the cogs of the New World Order.
[02:42:53.747 --> 02:42:55.309]  We'll talk about that on the other side with Chris Sky.
[02:42:59.329 --> 02:43:11.302]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to InfoWarsTore.com and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body, and keep us on air.
[02:43:11.302 --> 02:43:15.647]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in
[02:43:16.207 --> 02:43:19.649]  Many of you for years have never gone to InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:43:19.649 --> 02:43:28.434]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to InfoWarsTore.com and never experience these great products and never find the operation.
[02:43:28.434 --> 02:43:31.495]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show.
[02:43:31.495 --> 02:43:32.436]  That's great and I thank you.
[02:43:32.856 --> 02:43:34.396]  But we need funds to operate.
[02:43:34.396 --> 02:43:42.758]  Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people, like our CBD oil, and our Fizzy Magnesium, and our Sleep Aid, and our Nitric Oxide, and our Real Red Pill.
[02:43:42.758 --> 02:43:45.699]  Plus, all of these are really great products that keep us on air.
[02:43:45.699 --> 02:43:47.479]  Plus, you're missing out on having these products.
[02:43:47.479 --> 02:43:48.799]  So, get off the bench.
[02:43:48.799 --> 02:43:49.620]  Get in the game.
[02:43:49.620 --> 02:43:56.381]  Step to the plate and go to InfoWarsTore.com right now and get these great InfoWars products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:43:59.798 --> 02:44:02.942]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[02:44:02.942 --> 02:44:05.245]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:44:05.245 --> 02:44:09.190]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:44:09.190 --> 02:44:17.240]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:44:18.095 --> 02:44:24.879]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[02:44:24.879 --> 02:44:26.920]  It's really just incredible.
[02:44:26.920 --> 02:44:29.802]  So for myself, the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:44:29.802 --> 02:44:35.606]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:44:36.326 --> 02:44:37.286]  I know you spread the word.
[02:44:37.286 --> 02:44:38.807]  I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[02:44:38.807 --> 02:44:39.367]  Keep doing it.
[02:44:39.367 --> 02:44:48.309]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsTore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time keeping us on air.
[02:44:48.309 --> 02:44:52.610]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:44:52.610 --> 02:44:57.572]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsTore.com, our funding problems will be over.
[02:44:57.572 --> 02:44:58.332]  Please take action now.
[02:45:00.726 --> 02:45:07.130]  It's hard to believe that we're already going into March 2023, and the world is an insane place.
[02:45:07.130 --> 02:45:08.871]  World War III has already started.
[02:45:08.871 --> 02:45:11.193]  Biden is a puppet and is dissolving our borders.
[02:45:11.193 --> 02:45:12.353]  There's mass censorship.
[02:45:12.353 --> 02:45:14.575]  James O'Keefe's been removed from Project Veritas.
[02:45:14.575 --> 02:45:16.836]  The list goes on and on of the bad things that are happening.
[02:45:16.836 --> 02:45:21.219]  But the good things that are happening is humanity is really accelerating its awakening.
[02:45:21.479 --> 02:45:25.421]  But those of us on the forefront are under more attack by the establishment than ever.
[02:45:25.421 --> 02:45:33.846]  That's why I'm counting on you to spread the word about the broadcast, to pray for the broadcast, and to keep the broadcast on the air by getting great products at InfoWarshaw.com.
[02:45:33.846 --> 02:45:42.491]  And whether it's a final signed copy, they're almost all sold out, or the great reset in the War of the World, or Ultimate Bone Broth, finally back in stock after over two years, it's all available at InfoWarshaw.com.
[02:45:42.491 --> 02:45:44.112]  These are truly amazing products.
[02:45:44.272 --> 02:45:50.464]  So, get your InfoWars products at InfoWarsStore.com and enrich your life while keeping the broadcast on the air.
[02:45:50.464 --> 02:45:55.052]  It is your decision on whether or not we stay on air, so please take action now at InfoWarsStore.
[02:45:58.652 --> 02:46:00.634]  I've got some good news.
[02:46:00.634 --> 02:46:07.499]  Our high-quality supplements really work, and we have about an 80% reorder rate with customers.
[02:46:07.499 --> 02:46:08.339]  That's the good news.
[02:46:08.339 --> 02:46:09.480]  They're amazing.
[02:46:09.480 --> 02:46:17.666]  The bad news is, around 1% or a little less of our actual viewers and listeners ever go to InfoWarstore.com and ever actually buy the products.
[02:46:17.666 --> 02:46:21.109]  So you're missing out on these products, plus it funds the InfoWar.
[02:46:21.109 --> 02:46:26.033]  Think of what we've done with just 1% of our massive audience actually buying products.
[02:46:26.033 --> 02:46:26.873]  Think what would happen.
[02:46:27.774 --> 02:46:41.303]  If those of you on the fence actually went to InfoWarStore.com and got some of these amazing products, I would recommend Turmeric 95 for your joints, your bones, inflammation, to get one of the biggest effects, so you reorder it and see how great it is.
[02:46:41.303 --> 02:46:50.289]  Also, we've got the super high-quality, full-spectrum CBD oil that's so good for your neurological systems, your brain, your joints, your bones, as well.
[02:46:50.289 --> 02:46:51.650]  Or Real Red Pill Plus.
[02:46:51.650 --> 02:46:56.073]  Just go try the product, fund the InfoWar, and help us defeat the new order together.
[02:46:56.073 --> 02:46:57.414]  InfoWarStore.com.
[02:46:57.574 --> 02:46:59.935]  I wanted a hero.
[02:46:59.935 --> 02:47:00.476]  You got it.
[02:47:28.368 --> 02:47:30.429]  You got it.
[02:47:30.429 --> 02:47:31.850]  They're rising up all over.
[02:47:31.850 --> 02:47:33.591]  The people are rising up.
[02:47:33.591 --> 02:47:38.755]  Our awakening, our moment, is only just beginning, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:47:38.755 --> 02:47:41.696]  And we're going to go through some dark times, no doubt.
[02:47:41.696 --> 02:47:45.219]  But on the other side of it, we're going to be stronger, freer, and more prosperous than ever.
[02:47:46.147 --> 02:47:56.394]  And we'll put the final nail in the coffin of the New World Order and stop the idea of global government tyranny for generations to come.
[02:47:56.394 --> 02:48:01.057]  And Chris, this is the big thing I try to explain.
[02:48:01.057 --> 02:48:03.539]  And I think people understand this, but it's hard.
[02:48:03.539 --> 02:48:05.921]  We have been prosperous in the West.
[02:48:05.921 --> 02:48:09.403]  We have, for the most part, been free in the West.
[02:48:09.403 --> 02:48:12.946]  And maybe so free and prosperous, we've taken it for granted even.
[02:48:13.686 --> 02:48:16.207]  But now is the time to take action.
[02:48:16.207 --> 02:48:18.368]  Now is the time to make your voice heard.
[02:48:18.368 --> 02:48:24.490]  Now is your time to stand against tyranny and global government because it's not going to be so easy for long.
[02:48:24.490 --> 02:48:28.672]  And you may notice, folks, as Chris said, he's been arrested dozens of times.
[02:48:28.672 --> 02:48:30.312]  I've been arrested here as well.
[02:48:30.312 --> 02:48:34.434]  So you're starting to enter the fold of, OK, maybe there is a risk.
[02:48:34.574 --> 02:48:35.074]  I don't know.
[02:48:57.443 --> 02:48:57.863]  Agreed.
[02:48:57.863 --> 02:49:01.886]  People need to use me as an example because for me it wasn't just a few nights in jail.
[02:49:01.886 --> 02:49:03.788]  I had my license taken away.
[02:49:03.788 --> 02:49:07.410]  I haven't been able to drive since May 2021.
[02:49:07.410 --> 02:49:10.452]  They even took my gun license and all my legally owned firearms.
[02:49:10.452 --> 02:49:12.334]  Somebody who's never committed a crime in their life.
[02:49:13.254 --> 02:49:16.575]  I'm still banned from flying on the majority of Canadian airlines.
[02:49:16.575 --> 02:49:23.136]  I even made a video the other day of me trying to book an online flight and as soon as my name is put in, it gives you an error.
[02:49:23.136 --> 02:49:27.497]  So if you think that they're only planning on doing this kind of thing to me, no.
[02:49:27.497 --> 02:49:33.118]  I'm the example because they're showing you what they plan to do to you if you step out of line.
[02:49:33.118 --> 02:49:39.660]  And if we let them do that to me and we let them do that to a few other people, that's going to become the literal new normal.
[02:49:39.660 --> 02:49:40.500]  And that's what they want.
[02:49:40.800 --> 02:49:43.541]  They want to take away your individual rights and freedoms.
[02:49:43.541 --> 02:49:53.605]  They want to remake the power structure to the point where Americans love being independent and Americans love the idea that their government works for them because that's how it's supposed to be.
[02:49:54.381 --> 02:50:03.767]  Under their new world order, under their climate change, their 15-minute city, their carbon allowance, their digital ID, that all changes.
[02:50:03.767 --> 02:50:06.529]  You now become dependent on the government.
[02:50:06.529 --> 02:50:14.694]  The government is now involved in every single decision in your life, and the government no longer serves you, the government rules you.
[02:50:14.694 --> 02:50:15.755]  Oh, that's me getting arrested.
[02:50:15.755 --> 02:50:18.637]  That was the first COVID fine ever handed out in Canada, by the way.
[02:50:21.581 --> 02:50:23.205]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[02:50:23.205 --> 02:50:26.232]  You certainly take tyranny with a smile.
[02:50:26.232 --> 02:50:27.756]  A million dollar smile at that.
[02:50:29.471 --> 02:50:34.994]  Well, that's what you gotta do because their whole thing is to try to keep you in a negative state of mind.
[02:50:34.994 --> 02:50:39.937]  Because everything that's going on has to take you to volunteer.
[02:50:39.937 --> 02:50:46.700]  They're not literally forcing you down and putting that vaccine and you are slapping the mask on your face for the vast most part.
[02:50:46.700 --> 02:50:52.103]  They're just putting some type of pressure on you, mostly psychologically, to make you comply.
[02:50:52.774 --> 02:50:55.755]  And if you go along with it, they're just going to do more.
[02:50:55.755 --> 02:50:56.915]  That's what we try to tell people.
[02:50:56.915 --> 02:51:00.117]  Everybody thought they could get through COVID because it's only temporary.
[02:51:00.117 --> 02:51:01.157]  So just go along with it.
[02:51:01.157 --> 02:51:02.217]  Keep your head down.
[02:51:02.217 --> 02:51:04.098]  And we're going to come out of this eventually.
[02:51:04.098 --> 02:51:09.860]  But then they slowly realized that when they complied with step one, it went to step two, and then step three.
[02:51:09.860 --> 02:51:13.161]  And then all of a sudden, they're at step nine, and they're in full out tyranny.
[02:51:13.161 --> 02:51:14.321]  And that's how tyranny works.
[02:51:14.321 --> 02:51:15.742]  It goes one step at a time.
[02:51:16.488 --> 02:51:19.489]  And they're using every single trick in the book.
[02:51:19.489 --> 02:51:24.350]  And we do got to talk about the war in Russia because it is the anniversary.
[02:51:24.350 --> 02:51:26.390]  And I believe that's their ace in the hole.
[02:51:26.390 --> 02:51:29.231]  And they're using that for a lot of different reasons.
[02:51:29.231 --> 02:51:36.292]  First of all, it's their catch-all for the rampant inflation on every single thing associated with cost of living.
[02:51:36.292 --> 02:51:40.953]  In reality, they're trying to push us all towards a universal basic income and a digital ID.
[02:51:40.953 --> 02:51:44.434]  So naturally, they want everything we use every month to get more expensive.
[02:51:44.754 --> 02:51:47.396]  So now Russia and the war is the excuse for that.
[02:51:47.396 --> 02:51:50.298]  It's also very convenient for them to launder money.
[02:51:50.298 --> 02:52:00.465]  And it's also their ace in the hole that when we do rise up and we do stop all their globalist agenda because they know that that's the most likely thing to happen and actually it's inevitable.
[02:52:01.005 --> 02:52:06.367]  All they need to do to distract us is ramp up the war in Russia, and Canada is going to be complacent in that.
[02:52:06.367 --> 02:52:16.292]  Canada, they're already setting it up, because they already want Chrystia Freeland, who's our Deputy Prime Minister, who's a Ukrainian, to become the next Secretary General of NATO.
[02:52:16.292 --> 02:52:26.436]  And not only is she a Ukrainian, when she was in school in the Ukraine, she was actually being investigated by the Russian KGB as an intelligence operative, and her grandfather
[02:52:26.836 --> 02:52:29.718]  Well this is so key that you're saying this right now because the current
[02:52:50.769 --> 02:52:58.654]  The current Secretary General, Soltzenberg, I always butcher his name, he's been very hesitant to get involved in this war.
[02:52:58.654 --> 02:53:06.638]  The pressure he gets from Biden and Poland is pretty much the only pressure keeping him from even saying some of the stuff against Russia.
[02:53:06.638 --> 02:53:17.825]  But if you look at the general approach and body of work in the last year, really, the Secretary General's not been all in the war against Russia, and neither had the majority of NATO countries.
[02:53:17.825 --> 02:53:19.786]  It's just propaganda coming from Western media.
[02:53:21.639 --> 02:53:21.719]  100%!
[02:53:21.719 --> 02:53:31.381]  And that's why they want to replace him with her, because she's a 100% crony for Ukraine, for this whole money laundering and everything else agenda.
[02:53:31.381 --> 02:53:40.564]  And if she becomes the head secretary general of NATO, you can bet that Ukraine will request NATO membership.
[02:53:40.564 --> 02:53:45.785]  And that's all it would take to really expand that war and create a World War III-like situation.
[02:53:45.785 --> 02:53:50.366]  And Canada's doing everything they can to stoke the flames of that war while on the sidelines saying that we're trying to help out.
[02:53:50.726 --> 02:54:03.156]  In fact, I have personal accounts of soldiers being dispatched, Air Force, from Canada to Latvia, which is the staging ground to go either into Poland or Ukraine directly.
[02:54:03.156 --> 02:54:06.478]  So why are Canadian forces going into Latvia?
[02:54:06.478 --> 02:54:08.900]  Under the guise of training Ukrainian soldiers.
[02:54:08.900 --> 02:54:13.464]  But we already know we're giving them money, we already know we're giving them weapons, and now we're giving them soldiers.
[02:54:13.724 --> 02:54:24.127]  So we're basically drawing them into this as NATO members and we're basically setting up the states to try to make Ukraine a NATO member so they can expand this war with Russia, China and everyone else.
[02:54:24.127 --> 02:54:31.749]  And that's their backup plan for when shit hits the fan and all the people decide we're not going to go along with their 15-minute city and everything else.
[02:54:31.749 --> 02:54:33.669]  They're going to use the war as a distraction.
[02:54:33.669 --> 02:54:36.990]  And until then it's just a very convenient way to launder money,
[02:54:37.594 --> 02:54:40.235]  Take all the money out of specific countries.
[02:54:40.235 --> 02:54:44.838]  To this day, over $100 billion has been given to Ukraine.
[02:54:44.838 --> 02:54:47.719]  I'm going to give people a little bit of a lesson here.
[02:54:47.719 --> 02:54:52.062]  Ukraine's entire national GDP is around $60 billion.
[02:54:52.062 --> 02:54:58.725]  So that's almost two years worth of their gross domestic product given away to them in a year.
[02:54:58.725 --> 02:55:01.206]  Their national debt is around $100 billion.
[02:55:02.583 --> 02:55:17.403]  So instead of waging this ridiculous war with Russia, if they hadn't come to terms with Russia and the world had given Ukraine this over $100 billion, they could have paid off their entire national deficit to $0.
[02:55:18.744 --> 02:55:26.165]  And still had billions and billions of dollars to invest into infrastructure and other projects for the country.
[02:55:26.165 --> 02:55:32.247]  Ukraine would become literally like the jewel of Europe, and it would have one of the highest standards of living in the world.
[02:55:32.247 --> 02:55:36.848]  Oh my gosh, it's so absurd, these people that don't understand the geopolitics like you obviously do.
[02:55:36.848 --> 02:55:43.769]  It's so absurd that people don't understand, and part of the process is maybe for selfish reasons Putin wants to, you know, be able to
[02:55:44.329 --> 02:55:50.172]  Work with Ukraine and take advantage of their situation geopolitically and the resources they have, no doubt.
[02:55:50.172 --> 02:55:53.854]  But also, it's like, if you're Ukraine, it's a no-brainer.
[02:55:53.854 --> 02:55:57.896]  What are you going to be the lapdog of Joe Biden for the rest of your life?
[02:55:57.896 --> 02:56:02.238]  What are you going to be the lapdog of the CIA for the rest of your life with a little twink up there?
[02:56:02.238 --> 02:56:04.519]  A controlled president running your country?
[02:56:04.519 --> 02:56:09.282]  Or do you want to be independent and work with Russia and probably do a lot better for yourself?
[02:56:10.743 --> 02:56:12.764]  And that's exactly what's going on.
[02:56:12.764 --> 02:56:16.186]  Everything that's going on in Ukraine is amazing for Zelensky.
[02:56:16.186 --> 02:56:18.387]  He's becoming one of the richest men in the world.
[02:56:18.387 --> 02:56:21.889]  But for the average Ukrainian, it's absolutely horrible.
[02:56:21.889 --> 02:56:26.751]  And they're exploiting that crisis to actually further their agendas in other countries.
[02:56:26.751 --> 02:56:37.477]  Because every country that they're attacking to put their 15-minute city carbon allowance, the digital ID, they're figuring out the weakness of that country, and they're using this war and other things to make that country weaker.
[02:56:37.817 --> 02:56:38.598]  We're good.
[02:56:54.751 --> 02:56:55.691]  We're good to go.
[02:57:23.497 --> 02:57:24.057]  U.S.
[02:57:24.057 --> 02:57:24.938]  Biolabs.
[02:57:24.938 --> 02:57:26.278]  Pentagon Biolabs.
[02:57:26.278 --> 02:57:27.059]  Of course the U.S.
[02:57:27.059 --> 02:57:29.020]  denied this and said Russia's lying.
[02:57:29.020 --> 02:57:31.901]  Then China said it, and they said, oh, you can't believe China.
[02:57:31.901 --> 02:57:32.821]  Well, now the U.S.
[02:57:32.821 --> 02:57:34.202]  government has admitted it.
[02:57:34.202 --> 02:57:38.424]  Victoria Nuland has admitted it, and there's a website that admits there's 46 of them.
[02:57:38.424 --> 02:57:40.505]  Now, this is all important stuff with Chris.
[02:57:40.505 --> 02:57:45.007]  Chris, do five more minutes with me, because I want to talk about the big thing to inspire people on the other side.
[02:57:48.553 --> 02:57:56.742]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic book that documents the globalists, in their own words, plan for our future.
[02:57:56.742 --> 02:57:58.204]  That is a hellish future.
[02:57:58.204 --> 02:58:07.134]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or InfoWarshore.com.
[02:58:07.594 --> 02:58:13.195]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[02:58:13.195 --> 02:58:15.776]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[02:58:15.776 --> 02:58:21.157]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy, at Infowarsware.com.
[02:58:21.157 --> 02:58:25.098]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[02:58:25.098 --> 02:58:30.619]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you help keep Infowars on the air.
[02:58:30.619 --> 02:58:33.060]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book.
[02:58:33.840 --> 02:58:34.902]  Or unsigned copies.
[02:58:34.902 --> 02:58:45.274]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowarshore.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library or give them to the local school.
[02:58:45.274 --> 02:58:46.316]  This is an Infowar.
[02:58:46.316 --> 02:58:48.198]  I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[02:58:48.198 --> 02:58:49.159]  I've got some good news.
[02:58:50.180 --> 02:58:57.063]  Our high-quality supplements really work, and we have about an 80% reorder rate with customers.
[02:58:57.063 --> 02:58:57.883]  That's the good news.
[02:58:57.883 --> 02:58:59.023]  They're amazing.
[02:58:59.023 --> 02:59:07.206]  The bad news is, around 1% or a little less of our actual viewers and listeners ever go to InfoWareStore.com and ever actually buy the products.
[02:59:07.206 --> 02:59:10.648]  So you're missing out on these products, plus it funds the InfoWare.
[02:59:10.648 --> 02:59:15.569]  Think of what we've done with just 1% of our massive audience actually buying products.
[02:59:15.569 --> 02:59:16.390]  Think what would happen.
[02:59:17.310 --> 02:59:30.858]  If those of you on the fence actually went to InfowarStore.com and got some of these amazing products, I would recommend Turmeric 95 for your joints, your bones, inflammation, to get one of the biggest effects, so you reorder it and see how great it is.
[02:59:30.858 --> 02:59:39.824]  Also, we've got the super high-quality, full-spectrum CBD oil that's so good for your neurological systems, your brain, your joints, your bones as well.
[02:59:39.824 --> 02:59:41.204]  Or Real Red Pill Plus.
[02:59:41.204 --> 02:59:45.147]  Just go try the product, fund the Infowar, and help us defeat the New World Order together.
[02:59:45.607 --> 03:00:05.279]  Infowarstore.com If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:05.279 --> 03:00:11.203]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have a very important message that you should have been taught properly in school.
[03:00:11.203 --> 03:00:12.224]  You probably weren't.
[03:00:12.950 --> 03:00:20.293]  You should have been taught to appreciate and understand by your forebearers, and you may not have been.
[03:00:20.293 --> 03:00:34.198]  And I want to explain why the concept of the United States of America is so important and the victory in the Revolutionary War was so game-changing for every human being on the planet.
[03:00:34.198 --> 03:00:35.279]  You see, leading up
[03:00:36.041 --> 03:00:50.138]  To the Revolutionary War, it was always a system of monarchs, and kings, and queens, and caste systems, where the average citizen was a subordinate, or an underclassman, or a slave.
[03:00:51.212 --> 03:00:55.556]  And what we did here in the Revolutionary War was we changed that.
[03:00:55.556 --> 03:00:57.878]  And we changed that for human history.
[03:00:57.878 --> 03:01:04.544]  And we continued to change that and continued to set the standard all the way even through the Civil War.
[03:01:04.544 --> 03:01:08.127]  And we can still be that standard bearer to this day.
[03:01:08.127 --> 03:01:11.150]  But here's how you need to interpret this.
[03:01:12.335 --> 03:01:19.358]  When you see Chris Sky going out there and standing up to tyranny, that's how a king behaves, because Chris Sky is a king.
[03:01:19.358 --> 03:01:28.182]  When you see Savannah Hernandez go out and stand up to Pete Booty Judge and the corrupt Biden officials in East Palestine, that's because Savannah Hernandez is a queen.
[03:01:29.042 --> 03:01:37.905]  You, my fellow Americans, you, my fellow North Americans, my Canadians, my people of this planet that yearn to be free and prosperous, you are a king.
[03:01:37.905 --> 03:01:39.265]  That is your birthright.
[03:01:39.265 --> 03:01:42.006]  When you are born free, you are a king.
[03:01:42.006 --> 03:01:47.008]  And it's time we start acting like the kings and the queens that we are.
[03:01:47.008 --> 03:01:48.908]  And it's not about a crown on your head.
[03:01:48.908 --> 03:01:56.370]  It's not about a fancy watch on your wrist, or a necklace around your neck, or the status of your bank account, or the size of your house.
[03:01:56.370 --> 03:01:57.591]  It's about what's in your heart.
[03:01:58.211 --> 03:01:59.852]  And it's about what's in your soul.
[03:01:59.852 --> 03:02:06.117]  And it's about taking that attitude right to a tyrant and saying, you will not take my kingdom from me!
[03:02:06.117 --> 03:02:13.762]  And so I'm calling on all my fellow Americans, right now, it's time for us to start acting like the kings and the queens.
[03:02:14.242 --> 03:02:17.424]  Well, I've got a very unique perspective on this, and you actually hit a nerve.
[03:02:17.424 --> 03:02:18.505]  You almost made me cry right there.
[03:02:39.755 --> 03:02:57.541]  Because my wife is an American citizen and you guys have a constitution that protects your rights, lets you speak, lets you be armed, lets you protect your family and friends and country enshrined in a document.
[03:02:57.541 --> 03:03:04.503]  If I had that here in Canada, the feeling of pride that I would have in my country and
[03:03:05.285 --> 03:03:12.409]  This drive to preserve that, and the drive to fight for freedom, would be something I wouldn't even be able to measure.
[03:03:12.409 --> 03:03:14.490]  Because I already feel that way.
[03:03:14.490 --> 03:03:25.456]  And I'm up here in Canada, and we have a Charter of Rights, which is basically the government saying, you have privileges when we say you have them, and we can take them away when you don't have them.
[03:03:25.456 --> 03:03:33.641]  So it's even harder for a Canadian to stand up to the system, because we don't have the same protections that you guys do.
[03:03:33.641 --> 03:03:35.002]  And the average American
[03:03:35.575 --> 03:03:37.976]  Simply takes that for granted.
[03:03:37.976 --> 03:03:40.096]  All day, every day.
[03:03:40.096 --> 03:03:46.378]  And they need to start realizing how lucky they are and how unique they are in the world.
[03:03:46.378 --> 03:03:51.000]  And stop believing in the propaganda that tells you that you're not special.
[03:03:51.000 --> 03:03:56.161]  You are the most special people that have ever existed on planet Earth.
[03:03:56.161 --> 03:04:02.003]  You have powers that don't exist anywhere else and have never existed anywhere else.
[03:04:02.623 --> 03:04:07.927]  And they're trying to make you feel like you're worthless, and they're trying to make you feel like you're helpless.
[03:04:07.927 --> 03:04:21.537]  And it's taking a guy like me, in a little tiny country, to stand up against a system with nothing, no money, no backing, and try to show you how powerful you really are.
[03:04:22.177 --> 03:04:33.764]  And if it takes me to run for office, to be able to unite the freedom movement, unite the people, not just in Canada and around the world, well I'll happily make that sacrifice.
[03:04:33.764 --> 03:04:50.434]  And I will make myself reachable to anybody who wants to help this cause because I don't just intend to help Toronto, I don't just intend to help Canada, I intend to save North America and then I believe that we can save the world like you guys have already done once before in history.
[03:04:50.915 --> 03:04:54.844]  It's tough to call upon you guys again, but that's what happens.
[03:04:54.844 --> 03:04:56.969]  I feel like I've been called upon and I'm answering.
[03:04:59.969 --> 03:05:09.674]  Humanity is in a fight for its very life, and InfoWars, for decades, has been at the very forefront of the fight for a pro-human future.
[03:05:09.674 --> 03:05:13.355]  We can't stay on air without your help, and I want to thank you all for your past support.

[03:05:48.985 --> 03:05:51.466]  In the last month, I got a little busy, so I didn't sign the books.
[03:05:51.466 --> 03:05:52.326]  We didn't have them for sale.
[03:05:52.326 --> 03:05:53.887]  But now, I signed the last books.
[03:05:53.887 --> 03:06:03.131]  You can get them right now.
[03:06:03.131 --> 03:06:12.454]  Alright, Jay Dyer is about to take over.
[03:06:12.454 --> 03:06:13.795]  I just had to remind you guys.
[03:06:15.202 --> 03:06:23.828]  Coupon code SAVEMUSHU at checkout at infowarsstore.com is good for 10% off your order.
[03:06:23.828 --> 03:06:28.351]  Hashtag Save Mushu on Twitter is trending since last night.
[03:06:28.351 --> 03:06:35.436]  Alex posted a video with his lovable fluff ball of a cat named Mushu, which is actually his daughter's cat.
[03:06:35.436 --> 03:06:40.940]  And in the middle of litigation and bankruptcy court fallout from the Sandy Hook stuff,
[03:06:42.219 --> 03:06:47.382]  He was questioned about his cat and the value of the cat.
[03:06:47.382 --> 03:06:52.904]  And if he's hiding assets in the cat, you know, maybe they might have to commandeer the cat as part of this case.
[03:06:52.904 --> 03:06:55.706]  And so we launched the effort.
[03:06:55.706 --> 03:06:57.427]  Hashtag Save Mooshu.
[03:06:57.427 --> 03:06:59.508]  And it is now a coupon code.

[03:07:29.223 --> 03:07:33.485]  All right, I'll be back hosting the War Room in about 50 minutes here.
[03:07:33.485 --> 03:07:39.749]  It's the Veterans Call-In Show on a Friday, so we're going to take a bunch of calls on the War Room as well as other breaking news stories I didn't get to.
[03:07:39.749 --> 03:07:44.751]  But for now, it's the great Jay Dyer taking us the rest of the way here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:07:44.751 --> 03:07:47.493]  Jay, take it away.
[03:07:47.493 --> 03:07:47.973]  Thanks, Owen.
[03:07:47.973 --> 03:07:49.194]  Glad to be here.
[03:07:49.194 --> 03:07:50.395]  So we are at this
[03:07:51.889 --> 03:07:58.313]  Anniversary, I guess you could say, of one year of tragedy in terms of warfare in the Ukraine.
[03:07:58.313 --> 03:08:16.663]  And so I thought it'd be great to kind of rehearse how we got to where we are and what the dangers are here because, you know, lately I've been diving really deep into the Cold War, trying to get an assessment of what was really going on, why there was this larger project throughout the Cold War to
[03:08:17.515 --> 03:08:17.715]  I think?
[03:08:36.935 --> 03:08:45.659]  The 20th century's two world wars and the Cold War, according to Dr. Carol Quigley, that was to exhaust the opponents of the Anglo-American establishment.
[03:08:45.659 --> 03:08:51.882]  And they would exhaust them through two world wars and then through a Cold War.
[03:08:51.882 --> 03:09:02.808]  And if we fast forward up to what happened to Russia in the fall of Sovietism, the fall of communism, this led to the invasion of Western
[03:09:03.653 --> 03:09:05.954]  economic warfare and looting.
[03:09:05.954 --> 03:09:19.582]  This is the Harvard, Summers, Rubin crew that came in and through IMF shock therapy reorganized and looted the wealth of Russia.
[03:09:19.582 --> 03:09:29.108]  So while I'm sure to many people's public appearances the idea was that Russia was going to be freed from Sovietism and it's true that the Soviet system was a
[03:09:29.935 --> 03:09:51.333]  Nightmare terrible system and communism is a nightmare terrible system Absolutely 100% and it's just amazing to me I can never really talk about this topic without people getting mad and assuming that I'm somehow kind of defending communism or sovietism when all I'm really trying to point out when we look into this is that there's a
[03:09:52.150 --> 03:10:13.224]  There's a danger of taking on new masters and particularly in the realm of the religious world, which we've been covering as we've analyzed various texts that get into the history of NATO and the history of the Vatican and both the CIA and the KGB kind of vying for influence and power with the Vatican.
[03:10:13.224 --> 03:10:21.410]  In order to understand this, we have to understand the Cold War and getting out of the dialectical thinking of thinking that
[03:10:22.162 --> 03:10:28.224]  The West is necessarily good, and the East is necessarily evil.
[03:10:28.224 --> 03:10:36.025]  If you read Brzezinski, for example, in his older writings all the way back to his 90s text, he talks about this being a Manichean dialectic.
[03:10:36.025 --> 03:10:42.067]  He says the Cold War was a Manichean dialectic arising out of the powers in the post-World War II period.
[03:10:43.795 --> 03:10:56.179]  And we might think that the West was waging a war against communism and socialism, but the reality is that the elites of the West were not really anti-Marxist.
[03:10:56.179 --> 03:11:06.143]  They were against what you might call classical Marxism, and that's because classical Marxism failed to achieve its objectives precisely because there was no workers' revolution, right?
[03:11:07.097 --> 03:11:08.458]  The workers didn't rise up.
[03:11:08.458 --> 03:11:16.465]  We didn't see the proletariat overthrowing their masters and, you know, taking over the means of production.
[03:11:16.465 --> 03:11:30.876]  But what did happen was that there was a reformed Marxism that found itself a lot more amenable to big capital, known as Fabian Socialism, that was a lot more effective and had a lot more power and influence.
[03:11:30.876 --> 03:11:34.419]  And it is in fact entities like the IMF, the World Bank,
[03:11:35.345 --> 03:11:50.773]  The United Nations, etc., etc., set up by the same Rhodes-Milner Rothschild Roundtable groups that then were able to seize America as well and turn it into an engine for this same power block.
[03:11:50.773 --> 03:12:04.120]  And they did that via backdoor deals, backdoor intelligence operatives such as Noel Coward, Roald Dahl, Ian Fleming, William Stevenson, and others who convinced
[03:12:05.109 --> 03:12:28.464]  FDR and convinced people in the administration to set up private intelligence network the secret intelligence network known as the OSS that would become the CIA which becomes America comes America's government and the secret government wasn't really tasked with protecting America from invaders protecting America from foreign threats and
[03:12:29.122 --> 03:12:37.725]  Really, it was tasked with controlling and steering America because we see that the other entity that was created out of this was, of course, the Council on Foreign Relations.
[03:12:37.725 --> 03:12:43.547]  And that's a policy steering group that sits above the government structure.
[03:12:43.547 --> 03:12:52.590]  And it, in fact, hands down the policies of the global elite to the government as a unaccountable, unelected, bureaucratic structure.
[03:12:53.934 --> 03:12:55.755]  That then controls government.
[03:12:55.755 --> 03:13:02.239]  So you're electing elected officials that submit to and are handed policy by these people who are unelected.
[03:13:02.239 --> 03:13:11.185]  And you look at entities in the government that really run things, the National Security Council, the State Department, it's always CFR people.
[03:13:11.185 --> 03:13:13.066]  Always.
[03:13:13.066 --> 03:13:16.348]  And the same CFR people go to the Bilderberg Group.
[03:13:16.348 --> 03:13:18.489]  And they are also members of the Trilateral Commission.
[03:13:20.934 --> 03:13:32.117]  And they make decisions about corporate policy globally, as well as government policy globally, because these corporations are above government.
[03:13:32.117 --> 03:13:34.217]  They own government.
[03:13:34.217 --> 03:13:39.978]  And until we recognize that, until people can figure that out, there's not going to be any changes.
[03:13:39.978 --> 03:13:43.219]  I'm not saying you can't care about who's elected.
[03:13:43.219 --> 03:13:45.960]  But as Quigley says, the president is limited, right?
[03:13:45.960 --> 03:13:47.300]  The president can only do so much.
[03:13:48.866 --> 03:13:51.328]  Your senators, your congressmen, they can only do so much.
[03:13:51.328 --> 03:13:53.929]  I mean, maybe on a local level they can do more.
[03:13:53.929 --> 03:14:03.475]  But we're dealing with an international elite and there's an international clique that not only has the ability to set up global institutions that give top-down global policy.
[03:14:03.475 --> 03:14:05.976]  Remember in the last three years, what did they say?
[03:14:05.976 --> 03:14:11.760]  Now it's going to be the UN and the CDC getting their policies directly from Rockefeller Foundation.
[03:14:13.573 --> 03:14:17.195]  This last week they had the World Government Summit, right?
[03:14:17.195 --> 03:14:38.667]  And they had all these global elites out there pushing for the idea of an international health organization, treaty, and control grid that would enforce mandated stabbies because what held them up the last time was local, national, and state laws.
[03:14:38.667 --> 03:14:42.789]  So they couldn't forcibly stabby everybody.
[03:14:44.531 --> 03:14:46.272]  Because of regulations they were saying.
[03:14:46.272 --> 03:14:50.355]  And I put these clips on my Twitter if you want to see them from the World Government Summit.
[03:14:50.355 --> 03:15:04.304]  And so they said in the next pandemic we want to get rid of all that so that we can forcibly, forcibly inject, inoculate, or experiment on track and trace.
[03:15:04.304 --> 03:15:13.811]  And so while Russia has within it of course a fifth column as Russian geopolitical analysts have written about, because a lot of the foundations and think tanks, Carnegie Endowment and so forth,
[03:15:14.677 --> 03:15:26.702]  Michael McFowell, they've been in Russia for a long time because the West took over and restructured after the collapse via the IMF shock therapy and the Harvard people.
[03:15:26.702 --> 03:15:30.543]  Then we have Putin kicking out a lot of these oligarchs, right?
[03:15:30.543 --> 03:15:31.844]  Late 90s, early 2000s.
[03:15:31.844 --> 03:15:43.949]  And that led to a new struggle, a new Cold War, this new East-West battle that's now emerging as a real large threat.
[03:15:44.986 --> 03:15:46.147]  So let's get into more of that.
[03:15:46.147 --> 03:15:53.592]  We want to talk about Heartland Theory, Mackinder, all that kind of stuff to give us the background as to where we might go in this crisis on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:15:53.592 --> 03:16:01.077]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[03:16:01.077 --> 03:16:02.838]  This is their big move.
[03:16:02.838 --> 03:16:06.641]  So, yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[03:16:06.641 --> 03:16:08.342]  He doesn't care.
[03:16:08.342 --> 03:16:09.603]  That's not his job.
[03:16:09.603 --> 03:16:11.344]  He's not the president of the United States.
[03:16:11.344 --> 03:16:13.886]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[03:16:15.194 --> 03:16:19.684]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[03:16:19.684 --> 03:16:20.826]  They must be opposed.
[03:16:21.414 --> 03:16:24.855]  Autocrats only understand one word.
[03:16:24.855 --> 03:16:26.035]  No.
[03:16:26.035 --> 03:16:26.875]  No.
[03:16:26.875 --> 03:16:27.635]  No.
[03:16:27.635 --> 03:16:28.516]  Exactly.
[03:16:28.516 --> 03:16:32.097]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[03:16:32.097 --> 03:16:35.197]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[03:16:35.197 --> 03:16:37.678]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[03:16:37.678 --> 03:16:40.178]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.

[03:16:43.799 --> 03:16:46.300]  We say no to you getting us into World War III.
[03:16:46.300 --> 03:16:46.720]  You're right!
[03:16:47.000 --> 03:16:51.743]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden, and we say no!
[03:16:51.743 --> 03:16:56.747]  And we say no to your war!
[03:16:56.747 --> 03:17:05.193]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars has proven itself in the last 28 years to be over the globalist target and having the biggest effect out there against those tyrants.

[03:19:58.453 --> 03:20:04.355]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:13.251 --> 03:20:14.312]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:14.312 --> 03:20:15.353]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[03:20:15.353 --> 03:20:32.848]  Jason House is talking about the setting for how we got into this grand chessboard situation with Russia and the new conflicts that have arisen in the last year and how it arises out of the alignments coming out of the Cold War.
[03:20:32.848 --> 03:20:37.312]  And we were talking about this idea of controlling the Eurasian heartland.
[03:20:37.312 --> 03:20:40.935]  This is an idea that comes out of the British imperial strategy of Lord Halford Mackinder.
[03:20:41.661 --> 03:20:49.250]  And it was the kind of operating system for the British Empire as a sea empire seeking to control the land power.
[03:20:49.250 --> 03:20:51.712]  You have the sea power and the land power.
[03:20:51.712 --> 03:20:54.495]  The land power, of course, being the Eurasian heartland.
[03:20:54.495 --> 03:20:57.419]  And that's why, of course, Russia and Ukraine are so crucial.
[03:20:58.395 --> 03:21:02.899]  In this strategy, Russia has to always be kept at bay, always has to be pushed back.
[03:21:02.899 --> 03:21:12.747]  That was the purpose of NATO, actually, as a defensive strategy during the Cold War, and then became offensive after the Cold War, which was a violation of what NATO was supposed to be.
[03:21:12.747 --> 03:21:25.878]  But we see NATO now tweeting out on its actual profile that NATO is the Marvel hero universe power as it fights against the evil Russians.
[03:21:26.856 --> 03:21:29.277]  I kid you not, that's actually on NATO's Twitter.
[03:21:29.277 --> 03:21:32.678]  They're tweeting out that they are William Wallace.
[03:21:32.678 --> 03:21:42.000]  Even though William Wallace actually fought against degenerate British kings, but NATO is saying that they're William Wallace because they're freedom fighters.
[03:21:42.000 --> 03:21:43.440]  What does it mean to fight for freedom?
[03:21:43.440 --> 03:21:43.941]  What is freedom?
[03:21:43.941 --> 03:21:52.743]  Well, in the case of this, this war has now been cast as a Rainbow Skittles T-R-A-N-S war.
[03:21:53.798 --> 03:21:59.161]  And NATO fighting for the rights of TRANS.
[03:21:59.161 --> 03:22:09.525]  So isn't it ironic that in the Cold War, you know, we were told that we're being persecuted by atheist communists.
[03:22:09.525 --> 03:22:19.150]  And if we just have neoliberalism, if we open up these other countries behind the Iron Curtain to economic liberalism, we'll have freedom.
[03:22:19.150 --> 03:22:20.070]  Religion can come back.
[03:22:21.315 --> 03:22:35.607]  What happened was, in reality, the largest institution in the West, the religious institution, the Roman Catholic Church, was literally being co-opted, advised, and utilized by the Central Intelligence Agency.
[03:22:35.607 --> 03:22:38.309]  And multiple books confirm this now.
[03:22:38.309 --> 03:22:46.076]  The deeper that I go into this, I'm really just amazed at how wide and how deep spread this is, even from two conflicting views of the Cold War.
[03:22:46.076 --> 03:22:50.059]  You have somebody like Paul Williams, who's a Roman Catholic, who's very critical
[03:22:50.800 --> 03:22:57.745]  of the CIA and the Vatican during the Cold War, who admits that it was essentially a captured institution for the CIA.
[03:22:57.745 --> 03:23:20.119]  And then we have a Cold Warrior himself, John Kohler's book, that admits that, yeah, of course the Brzezinski, of course Kissinger, of course William Casey, of course they were all working, and all the way back to William Colby with Gladio, of course they were working hand-in-hand with the Vatican, funneling black ops funds through the Vatican Bank
[03:23:21.545 --> 03:23:26.888]  To fight against the Soviets.
[03:23:26.888 --> 03:23:28.369]  And it sounds plausible, right?
[03:23:28.369 --> 03:23:29.590]  It sounds, okay, that makes sense.
[03:23:29.590 --> 03:23:32.231]  We don't want a bunch of commies running everything.
[03:23:32.231 --> 03:23:38.595]  But the danger here is that when Uncle Sam wins, it's not really Uncle Sam that wins.
[03:23:38.595 --> 03:23:42.337]  And it's not really communism being defeated for free market capitalism.
[03:23:42.337 --> 03:23:46.560]  It's monopoly capital using Fabian socialism
[03:23:49.159 --> 03:23:51.921]  To restructure these countries?
[03:23:51.921 --> 03:23:54.563]  I mean, is the EU?
[03:23:54.563 --> 03:23:59.586]  Does this seem to be a economic freedom based institution to you?
[03:23:59.586 --> 03:24:04.389]  Does the IMF seem like something that's based around economic freedom and liberty?
[03:24:04.389 --> 03:24:07.571]  Does UNESCO seem like something based around economic freedom and liberty?
[03:24:07.571 --> 03:24:12.314]  Well, if you mean by economic freedom and liberty going back to the British Empire and
[03:24:13.271 --> 03:24:16.213]  Social Darwinism and, you know, those kinds of things.
[03:24:16.213 --> 03:24:17.314]  I guess it does make sense.
[03:24:17.314 --> 03:24:27.202]  That would be, right, atomistic, individualistic, enlightenment libertarianism based around atheistic evolutionary philosophy.
[03:24:27.202 --> 03:24:29.623]  In which case, rights don't actually exist.
[03:24:29.623 --> 03:24:31.185]  There's no such thing as rights.
[03:24:31.185 --> 03:24:33.026]  Rights are just arbitrary.
[03:24:33.026 --> 03:24:39.671]  Because if we're all just manifestations of nature, nature doesn't have rights.
[03:24:39.671 --> 03:24:42.053]  Do you think the predator-prey relationship
[03:24:42.765 --> 03:24:44.706]  Has anything to do with rights?
[03:24:44.706 --> 03:24:47.467]  No, it's just brute power, brute force.
[03:24:47.467 --> 03:24:55.209]  And so we're presented with a situation post-Enlightenment of, are you going to choose Hobbesian, Leviathan state?
[03:24:55.209 --> 03:24:58.170]  Or do you want a revolutionary anarcho-state?
[03:24:58.170 --> 03:24:59.271]  No state.
[03:24:59.271 --> 03:25:07.994]  Which always, as Plato says, falls over into tyranny, because when you have the rule of the many, anarchy, that falls over into despotism and oligarchy.
[03:25:10.715 --> 03:25:17.879]  And so, it's just amazing to me that people would buy into this dialectic.
[03:25:17.879 --> 03:25:23.483]  And we're supposed to have believed that NATO was the good guy all these years.
[03:25:23.483 --> 03:25:25.904]  And the reality is that we're talking about two different bad guys.
[03:25:25.904 --> 03:25:35.010]  We're talking about Soviet Communism foisted upon Russia and the Baltic States via elites in the West.
[03:25:38.046 --> 03:25:42.868]  It's not Russia organically that was communist.
[03:25:42.868 --> 03:25:52.073]  It's not the West organically that has any of these ideologies that are unnatural to these people groups.
[03:25:52.073 --> 03:25:59.197]  These are created ideologies that are techniques and systems of control.
[03:25:59.197 --> 03:26:05.400]  And so now that we're in this post-Cold War era where the war became an international war on terror,
[03:26:06.568 --> 03:26:11.930]  I was watching a goofy movie the other night that illustrated this in a very profound way, which surprised me.
[03:26:11.930 --> 03:26:24.756]  We've done a lot of analyses of the Bond films, and typically we think about, oh, well, the most revelatory ones are going to be the ones, you know, from the classic Ian Fleming period.
[03:26:24.756 --> 03:26:35.101]  But I was watching Tomorrow Never Dies from 1997, and the weirdest part about that one, I think that's the second to last, or maybe it's the second
[03:26:37.043 --> 03:26:39.964]  Pierce Brosnan, Bond film.
[03:26:39.964 --> 03:26:46.846]  And if you remember this plot, it's pretty instructive because you have this giant media empire, the Carver Media Group.
[03:26:46.846 --> 03:26:50.987]  Jonathan Pryce plays the Bond villain as a media mogul.
[03:26:50.987 --> 03:26:58.910]  And the media mogul decides that the world can be manipulated through fake news.
[03:26:58.910 --> 03:27:00.010]  Fake news!
[03:27:00.010 --> 03:27:01.851]  Right?
[03:27:01.851 --> 03:27:05.752]  And so not only does he engineer crises, he also
[03:27:07.000 --> 03:27:09.742]  creates the narrative around the crises that he's engineered.
[03:27:09.742 --> 03:27:22.651]  And the plot involves the East and the West being manipulated into a conflict by an international, supra-international group.
[03:27:22.651 --> 03:27:24.193]  And that's always in the Bond films, right?
[03:27:24.193 --> 03:27:25.574]  Obviously, there's Spectre, this kind of thing.
[03:27:25.574 --> 03:27:26.975]  Now, there's not Spectre in this one.
[03:27:26.975 --> 03:27:28.155]  This is, you know, 1987.
[03:27:28.155 --> 03:27:30.157]  But here's the weird part.
[03:27:30.157 --> 03:27:35.821]  So, Bond ends up working together at times with Russian, Soviet,
[03:27:36.938 --> 03:27:44.744]  I guess we're supposed to think it's post-Soviet, so they're not Soviet, but they act like, you know, that now it's a Soviet terror network.
[03:27:44.744 --> 03:27:54.971]  And then Bonn aligns himself with a Chinese communist spy to unfoil the plot of the international elite.
[03:27:54.971 --> 03:28:01.356]  Now, that's bizarre because, okay, there are international elites that try to play these powers off against one another.
[03:28:04.740 --> 03:28:11.501]  And I think that to a degree, that's what's going on, because I'm not saying that there's no real conflict or there's no real war.
[03:28:11.501 --> 03:28:12.202]  There is.
[03:28:12.202 --> 03:28:24.924]  But I'm saying that in so many films, we have an international elite, this kind of Kissinger, Brzezinski, Structure, Klaus, you know, the super international elite that plays the nation states off against one another.
[03:28:24.924 --> 03:28:28.145]  And they plan and prepare for wars decades ahead of time.
[03:28:29.770 --> 03:28:33.131]  And so I think, yeah, absolutely, they wanted this war in the Ukraine.
[03:28:33.131 --> 03:28:35.331]  And they want a new Cold War.
[03:28:35.331 --> 03:28:39.653]  And it's part of the overall strategy to bring in the technocracy.
[03:28:39.653 --> 03:28:46.774]  And we'll look at that here in a moment, get into the specifics of why these kinds of countries and states stand in the way.
[03:28:46.774 --> 03:28:54.656]  It doesn't mean that they're perfect, but they stand in the way of a certain kind of ideology, a certain kind of worldview that has to be pushed globally.
[03:28:54.656 --> 03:28:55.737]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:55.737 --> 03:28:56.577]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[03:28:57.574 --> 03:29:05.979]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars has proven itself the last 28 years to be over the globalist target and having the biggest effect out there against those tyrants.

[03:29:59.696 --> 03:30:04.318]  It's hard to believe that we're already going into March 2023.
[03:30:04.318 --> 03:30:06.098]  And the world is an insane place.
[03:30:06.098 --> 03:30:07.839]  World War III has already started.
[03:30:07.839 --> 03:30:10.160]  Biden is a puppet and is dissolving our borders.
[03:30:10.160 --> 03:30:11.321]  There's mass censorship.
[03:30:11.321 --> 03:30:13.521]  James O'Keefe's been removed from Project Veritas.
[03:30:13.521 --> 03:30:15.802]  The list goes on and on of the bad things that are happening.
[03:30:15.802 --> 03:30:20.184]  But the good things that are happening is humanity is really accelerating its awakening.
[03:30:20.444 --> 03:30:24.387]  But those of us on the forefront are under more attack by the establishment than ever.
[03:30:24.387 --> 03:30:32.794]  That's why I'm counting on you to spread the word about the broadcast, to pray for the broadcast, and to keep the broadcast on the air by getting great products at InfoWarshaw.com.

[03:31:48.440 --> 03:31:51.762]  In the last month, I got a little busy, so I didn't sign the books, we didn't have them for sale.
[03:31:51.762 --> 03:31:54.003]  But now, I signed the last books, you can get them right now.
[03:31:57.975 --> 03:32:06.180]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic book that documents the globalists, in their own words, plan for our future.
[03:32:06.180 --> 03:32:07.621]  That is the hellish future.
[03:32:07.621 --> 03:32:17.046]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or InfoWarshore.com.
[03:32:17.046 --> 03:32:22.630]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[03:32:22.630 --> 03:32:24.611]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[03:32:25.191 --> 03:32:30.573]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy, at InfoWarsHore.com.
[03:32:30.573 --> 03:32:34.514]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[03:32:34.514 --> 03:32:40.396]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you help keep InfoWars on the air.
[03:32:40.396 --> 03:32:42.477]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book.
[03:32:43.277 --> 03:32:44.338]  Or unsigned copies.
[03:32:44.338 --> 03:32:54.686]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowarshore.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library or give them to the local school.
[03:32:54.686 --> 03:32:55.726]  This is an Infowar.
[03:32:55.726 --> 03:32:58.328]  I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[03:32:58.328 --> 03:33:02.932]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:33:02.932 --> 03:33:04.213]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:16.053 --> 03:33:16.954]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:16.954 --> 03:33:18.094]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[03:33:18.094 --> 03:33:32.243]  Today's analysis, you know, what's interesting is that the time of World War II, when Hitler understood the importance geostrategically of trying to control Ukraine and to push back on Russia.
[03:33:33.107 --> 03:33:44.412]  The Galen Network, Reinhard Galen and other Nazis, had actually trained and set up a lot of the intelligence and black ops structures in these areas.
[03:33:44.412 --> 03:33:48.474]  And this ties into NATO's Gladio operations.
[03:33:48.474 --> 03:33:54.517]  And what's amazing is that those networks then were sort of taken over by the West.
[03:33:54.517 --> 03:33:56.938]  We all know about Operation Paperclip.
[03:33:56.938 --> 03:34:01.640]  But people like Dulles and others, Bill Donovan, they also made alliances with
[03:34:02.279 --> 03:34:08.924]  These Galen networks that are still running things, still doing these operations in the Ukraine.
[03:34:08.924 --> 03:34:26.938]  So it's amazing all the posturing in the West about being everybody who's not for total liberalism as a Nazi, and yet we're openly supporting and aiding, openly take pictures with Nazi battalions in the Ukraine.
[03:34:26.938 --> 03:34:28.279]  The real, actual Nazis.
[03:34:29.930 --> 03:34:36.314]  I mean, this is just absurd levels of stupidity and hypocrisy and it's just, it's kind of amazing to me.
[03:34:36.314 --> 03:34:38.995]  And people think that this is some kind of Bayes Redfield thing.
[03:34:38.995 --> 03:34:39.335]  It's not.
[03:34:39.335 --> 03:34:43.698]  It's a completely controlled and manipulated operation.
[03:34:43.698 --> 03:34:46.760]  And it has nothing really to do with these ideologies.
[03:34:46.760 --> 03:34:57.806]  Other than that, these are control groups that are controlled by Western intelligence to engage in irregular warfare, to engage in proxy warfare,
[03:34:58.473 --> 03:35:06.158]  To destabilize and to restructure and destroy areas to fit them into, not the American Century.
[03:35:06.158 --> 03:35:07.319]  Do people understand that?
[03:35:07.319 --> 03:35:15.305]  All these boomers and Cold War people saying, we're going to fight the communists, we're going to keep the KGB and Russia out of Ukraine.
[03:35:15.305 --> 03:35:18.146]  No, it's not the American Century anymore.
[03:35:18.146 --> 03:35:21.569]  Do you understand that that was a con?
[03:35:21.569 --> 03:35:25.071]  And maybe there could have been an American Century that wasn't a con, I don't know.
[03:35:25.071 --> 03:35:27.553]  But all the people who came up with the idea of the American Century,
[03:35:29.412 --> 03:35:43.348]  The State Department, George Keenan, that was all dreamt up by the CFR and the 1939 War and Peace Studies Project from the New York City Council on Foreign Relations.
[03:35:43.348 --> 03:35:47.453]  That's when they created, right after that, the UN.
[03:35:47.453 --> 03:35:48.034]  Right at that time.
[03:35:50.302 --> 03:36:06.951]  And so this idea of fostering democracy, fostering free market liberalism, which is not really what it was, that was for the Fortune 100, Fortune 500 to go into these countries and restructure them to loot them.
[03:36:06.951 --> 03:36:13.895]  So again, does that make the Cold War Iron Curtain, does that make them good?
[03:36:13.895 --> 03:36:16.597]  No.
[03:36:16.597 --> 03:36:18.418]  But is it possible?
[03:36:19.139 --> 03:36:21.340]  That we have turned into a worse thing.
[03:36:21.340 --> 03:36:23.080]  That's what I'm trying to posit to you.
[03:36:23.080 --> 03:36:37.025]  And the more that I read about the Stas and the KGB and all this stuff, and how awful they were, all the awful stuff that they did to people in these books, I'm just reminded of, well, but aren't the global elite that run things now like 10 times worse?
[03:36:37.025 --> 03:36:39.666]  Are they doing 10 times worse things?
[03:36:39.666 --> 03:36:44.768]  Is it what they want to set up with every area of your life tracked and traced?
[03:36:44.768 --> 03:36:46.549]  A 10 times worse version of all that stuff?
[03:36:47.924 --> 03:36:55.250]  Seems like it to me.
[03:36:55.250 --> 03:37:14.846]  And while it's true that communism had this ridiculous idealistic system that was based around everyone being essentially sacrificed to the collective and to this bizarre technocratic atheistic system, that was an older technocratic model that has caved to a new technocratic model
[03:37:15.626 --> 03:37:20.108]  If you remember the way that Bertrand Russell and H.G.
[03:37:20.108 --> 03:37:30.513]  Wells, these big level strategists, the way they talked about communism and socialism and Marxism was as if they were experiments in other countries to see how well they functioned.
[03:37:30.513 --> 03:37:35.595]  How well they worked as control mechanisms in other areas and for certain people.
[03:37:35.595 --> 03:37:40.197]  And not every system works that well to control everybody equally.
[03:37:40.197 --> 03:37:42.698]  Because different regions, different people groups,
[03:37:43.425 --> 03:37:58.091]  Require different strategies, that's why the CIA studies ethnography, to master the local customs and idiosyncrasies of various peoples to best influence and control them.
[03:37:58.091 --> 03:38:04.093]  And so, do we understand what's going on really?
[03:38:04.093 --> 03:38:11.636]  And does it mean that Russia is a representation of authentic, pure, 100% accurate Christianity?
[03:38:13.792 --> 03:38:19.174]  There's absolutely corruption in Eastern Bloc countries.
[03:38:19.174 --> 03:38:23.955]  There's absolutely corruption in the Russian government, sure.
[03:38:23.955 --> 03:38:24.835]  But that's everywhere.
[03:38:24.835 --> 03:38:33.037]  And if you listen to Putin's speech, what did Putin say about what Russia represents?
[03:38:33.037 --> 03:38:38.659]  It's the representation of a system that didn't completely get destroyed
[03:38:40.308 --> 03:38:53.571]  In other words, there's a representation of the maintenance of a people and their faith and their tradition.
[03:38:53.571 --> 03:39:01.872]  And that they don't want enforced Satanism.
[03:39:01.872 --> 03:39:09.914]  And even if Putin is some villain or something, which he just seems to be a pragmatic global leader like anyone else, right?
[03:39:10.635 --> 03:39:12.436]  People always ask me all the time, what do you think about Putin?
[03:39:12.436 --> 03:39:13.477]  What do you think about Elon Musk?
[03:39:13.477 --> 03:39:15.017]  What do you think about Donald Trump?
[03:39:15.017 --> 03:39:15.818]  I don't know.
[03:39:15.818 --> 03:39:18.619]  I don't have any thoughts other than I like it when they do something good.
[03:39:18.619 --> 03:39:22.681]  And if they do something bad, I disagree.
[03:39:22.681 --> 03:39:28.664]  So there's no hype dreams about, you know, some utopia that's going to be created in some other country.
[03:39:28.664 --> 03:39:37.089]  But there is the reality of Western elites being completely maniacal, completely out of touch with reality, completely
[03:39:38.698 --> 03:39:45.001]  I mean, it's people like Brzezinski and Kissinger and Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and George Soros.
[03:39:45.001 --> 03:39:47.322]  I mean, they brag about what they're doing.
[03:39:47.322 --> 03:39:52.844]  They're 100% into Malthusianism.
[03:39:52.844 --> 03:39:56.766]  But even the Soviets weren't maniacal Malthusians, right?
[03:39:56.766 --> 03:40:00.768]  They had ridiculous things like Lysenkoism and these stupid philosophies.
[03:40:00.768 --> 03:40:04.890]  And they would certainly kill and starve off people who opposed them.
[03:40:09.151 --> 03:40:18.316]  Our elite, who by the way supported all those ideas, now want something 10 times worse than that.
[03:40:18.316 --> 03:40:21.937]  Do you understand how crazy that is?
[03:40:21.937 --> 03:40:25.359]  And now we're at the point where it's like, oh yeah, now we need to nuke.
[03:40:25.359 --> 03:40:29.261]  We need to blow everything up, destroy everything.
[03:40:29.261 --> 03:40:33.823]  These lunatics like Sean Penn.
[03:40:33.823 --> 03:40:34.764]  Let's nuke everybody.
[03:40:34.764 --> 03:40:36.805]  Let's nuke all of those, blow everything up.
[03:40:38.112 --> 03:40:43.674]  I mean, I can't imagine that these people... I mean, it's almost as if they're completely taken over by something else.
[03:40:43.674 --> 03:40:47.476]  Something else is running them.
[03:40:47.476 --> 03:40:57.800]  And they just have this innate thirst for the destruction of cities, the destruction of countries, the destruction of what they think is their enemy.
[03:40:57.800 --> 03:41:05.003]  Like the VIEW heartbeat saying that everybody in the Midwest deserves to be destroyed.
[03:41:05.003 --> 03:41:05.283]  Because...
[03:41:07.469 --> 03:41:08.950]  That state went for Trump?
[03:41:08.950 --> 03:41:11.152]  That's crazy.
[03:41:11.152 --> 03:41:19.197]  But we see the spirit that motivates somebody like that can't be good.
[03:41:19.197 --> 03:41:23.860]  That is a demonic spirit.
[03:41:23.860 --> 03:41:29.944]  And so this whole Cold War situation and where we're going is not random conflicts.
[03:41:29.944 --> 03:41:34.928]  This is all drawn up by the Rand Corporation, drawn up by these entities created out of
[03:41:35.962 --> 03:41:37.623]  The same network that I'm talking about.
[03:41:37.623 --> 03:41:39.185]  The Deep State.
[03:41:39.185 --> 03:41:41.467]  By the way, it's great that Trump called out Victoria Nuland.
[03:41:41.467 --> 03:41:47.732]  That's, I mean, that's who has been pushing this for all this time.
[03:41:47.732 --> 03:41:50.074]  Trying to provoke this conflict.
[03:41:50.074 --> 03:41:59.802]  Trying to provoke Russia for all these years back to 2014 and all the way back to the 80s with the color revolutions.
[03:41:59.802 --> 03:42:03.645]  But if Rand Corporation was drawing up these strategies and these plans decades ago,
[03:42:04.540 --> 03:42:10.763]  Then how can it be the fault of countries that just want to preserve what they are and their way of life?
[03:42:10.763 --> 03:42:13.905]  And Ukraine is not a historic nation-state.
[03:42:13.905 --> 03:42:15.626]  It's part of Russia.
[03:42:15.626 --> 03:42:18.407]  So, of course they want Ukraine.
[03:42:18.407 --> 03:42:21.549]  Why wouldn't they when that is the heart of Russia?
[03:42:21.549 --> 03:42:25.231]  Kiev is the heart of Russia.
[03:42:25.231 --> 03:42:29.473]  And breaking it off is a Western imperial strategy.
[03:42:29.473 --> 03:42:31.594]  Going all the way back to World War I.
[03:42:33.931 --> 03:42:42.033]  So you have to understand that this is a bigger game that's being played, and it doesn't mean that Russia or any of these other countries is a perfect utopia.
[03:42:42.033 --> 03:42:52.736]  It means that they represent things that stand in the way of the advance of total technocracy and total Malthusian depopulation, total destruction.
[03:42:52.736 --> 03:42:53.536]  That's what it represents.
[03:42:53.536 --> 03:42:54.196]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:42:54.196 --> 03:42:55.096]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:55.096 --> 03:42:57.477]  I'm Jay Dyer.
[03:42:57.477 --> 03:42:57.937]  Right now,
[03:42:59.045 --> 03:43:09.433]  I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to InfoWarsTore.com and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body and keep us on air.
[03:43:09.433 --> 03:43:17.819]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in, many of you for years, and never gone to InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:43:17.819 --> 03:43:26.285]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to InfoWarsTore.com and never experience these great products and never find the operation.
[03:43:26.585 --> 03:43:29.647]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show.
[03:43:29.647 --> 03:43:31.009]  That's great, and I thank you.
[03:43:31.009 --> 03:43:32.530]  But we need funds to operate.
[03:43:32.530 --> 03:43:40.896]  Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people, like our CBD oil, and our fizzy magnesium, and our sleep aid, and our nitric oxide, and our real red pill.
[03:43:40.896 --> 03:43:42.978]  Plus, all of these are really great products.
[03:43:42.978 --> 03:43:43.859]  They keep us on air.
[03:43:43.859 --> 03:43:45.640]  Plus, you're missing out on having these products.
[03:43:45.640 --> 03:43:46.941]  So get off the bench.
[03:43:46.941 --> 03:43:47.782]  Get in the game.
[03:43:47.782 --> 03:43:54.547]  Step to the plate, and go to InfoWarsStore.com right now and get these great InfoWars products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:43:56.701 --> 03:43:57.822]  InfoWars.
[03:43:57.822 --> 03:44:00.763]  Tomorrow's news today.
[03:44:00.763 --> 03:44:02.865]  This is their big move.
[03:44:02.865 --> 03:44:06.647]  So yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[03:44:06.647 --> 03:44:08.348]  He doesn't care.
[03:44:08.348 --> 03:44:09.608]  That's not his job.
[03:44:09.608 --> 03:44:11.349]  He's not the President of the United States.
[03:44:11.349 --> 03:44:15.212]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[03:44:15.212 --> 03:44:19.714]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[03:44:19.714 --> 03:44:20.835]  They must be opposed.
[03:44:21.588 --> 03:44:24.871]  Autocrats only understand one word.
[03:44:24.871 --> 03:44:26.052]  No.
[03:44:26.052 --> 03:44:26.893]  No.
[03:44:26.893 --> 03:44:27.654]  No.
[03:44:27.654 --> 03:44:28.554]  Exactly.
[03:44:28.554 --> 03:44:32.118]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[03:44:32.118 --> 03:44:35.220]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[03:44:35.220 --> 03:44:37.703]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[03:44:37.703 --> 03:44:40.205]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[03:44:40.205 --> 03:44:43.828]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[03:44:43.828 --> 03:44:46.350]  We say no to you getting us into World War III.
[03:44:46.350 --> 03:44:46.751]  You're right.
[03:44:47.031 --> 03:44:51.780]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden, and we say no!
[03:44:51.780 --> 03:44:57.490]  And we say no to your war!
[03:44:57.490 --> 03:44:57.971]  Right now.
[03:44:59.079 --> 03:45:09.483]  I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to InfoWarsaw.com and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body, and keep us on air.
[03:45:09.483 --> 03:45:17.847]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in, many of you for years, and never gone to InfoWarsaw.com.
[03:45:17.847 --> 03:45:26.330]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to InfoWarsaw.com and never experience these great products and never fund the operation.

[03:45:31.053 --> 03:45:32.574]  But we need funds to operate.
[03:45:32.574 --> 03:45:40.940]  Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people, like our CBD oil, and our fizzy magnesium, and our sleep aid, and our nitric oxide, and our real red pill.

[03:45:56.914 --> 03:45:59.617]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[03:45:59.617 --> 03:46:04.501]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies.
[03:46:04.501 --> 03:46:09.806]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication, it takes commitment.
[03:46:09.806 --> 03:46:19.816]  That's why I ask listeners, respectfully, to go to infowarestore.com and buy great products that will enrich and empower your life while keeping us on air at the very same time.

[03:47:13.609 --> 03:47:14.469]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:14.469 --> 03:47:16.090]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jason House.
[03:47:16.090 --> 03:47:22.132]  As we were talking about what emerged out of the Cold War dialectic and what the long-term plan was.
[03:47:22.132 --> 03:47:26.073]  And the long-term plan is now completely evident, right?
[03:47:26.073 --> 03:47:33.796]  Again, I think we could give some leeway to people in the 50s, 60s, 70s, you know, living in the time of the Cold War.
[03:47:33.796 --> 03:47:35.556]  They didn't have access to the information.
[03:47:35.556 --> 03:47:37.837]  They didn't have access to what we have access to now.
[03:47:38.974 --> 03:47:41.476]  And so a lot of good people, including my family members.
[03:47:41.476 --> 03:47:53.443]  I had family members that fought for the West and were Cold Warriors, that engaged in Cold War activities for the Air Force, for example.
[03:47:53.443 --> 03:48:07.291]  And so, you know, it has nothing to do with, I want to pick some side because I have this idealistic view that somehow there's going to be this future Orthodox Christian Empire or that Russia is going to save the world or something like that.
[03:48:09.028 --> 03:48:11.629]  Maybe Russia saves the world by India.
[03:48:11.629 --> 03:48:11.989]  I don't know.
[03:48:11.989 --> 03:48:13.089]  I mean, things are getting so crazy.
[03:48:13.089 --> 03:48:13.649]  Who knows?
[03:48:13.649 --> 03:48:33.655]  But I don't think that salvation or anything like that comes necessarily from a nation state per se, but God can providentially use situations like this to stave off completely demonized structures that are openly, everybody can see what's being promoted by the Western elite now.
[03:48:33.655 --> 03:48:36.436]  And 100% this is a global agenda.
[03:48:36.436 --> 03:48:37.596]  They want to push this everywhere.
[03:48:38.729 --> 03:48:44.713]  And so what's happening is the removal of potential areas of resistance.
[03:48:44.713 --> 03:48:49.656]  And that's not just the Ukraine conflict.
[03:48:49.656 --> 03:48:52.939]  That also is domestically in the West.
[03:48:52.939 --> 03:48:58.162]  It's anybody in the Western countries that potentially could stand up to or oppose a threat.
[03:48:58.162 --> 03:49:04.786]  And that's why there are these long-term operations to demographically destroy different areas and regions.
[03:49:04.786 --> 03:49:06.087]  It's an open-stated thing.
[03:49:06.087 --> 03:49:06.948]  There's a book called
[03:49:07.725 --> 03:49:09.766]  Weapons of Mass Migration by Kelly Greenhill.
[03:49:09.766 --> 03:49:12.887]  I think it's a Stanford University publication.
[03:49:12.887 --> 03:49:15.588]  I think it's connected to the Army War College.
[03:49:15.588 --> 03:49:18.469]  It's about warfare with population.
[03:49:18.469 --> 03:49:27.472]  But you can't talk about that because that makes you a bad person, even though it's a public fact that it's a real strategy of warfare.
[03:49:27.472 --> 03:49:34.414]  And that's to weaken and destroy, to integrate into this coming global government.
[03:49:35.333 --> 03:49:48.396]  So the danger is that now that we're reaching this, coming to a head, and now we have Zelensky and others threatening World War III if there's a union between Russia and China.
[03:49:48.396 --> 03:49:55.558]  Again, keep in mind that it doesn't make any of these powers necessarily the good guys.
[03:49:55.558 --> 03:50:04.440]  And my point is that, as I was pointing out with the Bond film, Tomorrow Never Dies, there's a lot of other movies that have the same kind of plot going on.
[03:50:04.440 --> 03:50:04.880]  Think about
[03:50:06.128 --> 03:50:17.193]  X-Men, the one with Michael Fassbender, where he's Magneto, you have this elite group that's trying to kick off a nuclear exchange between the East and the West.
[03:50:17.193 --> 03:50:24.936]  Think about war games, where an AI tries to kick off this global world war between the East and the West.
[03:50:24.936 --> 03:50:31.279]  Think about Tomorrow Never Dies, where an elite group is trying to cause and instantiate and enact a war between the East and the West.
[03:50:32.868 --> 03:50:46.018]  And so I think that there is a desire on the part of some of the more demonically energized elites in the West that they would be happy to see full-on total war.
[03:50:46.018 --> 03:50:52.664]  Because eventually what happens is that these people are so given over to evil that they're not even in control of their own faculties anymore.
[03:50:52.664 --> 03:51:00.710]  They lose their own reasoning faculty and they become essentially united with evil powers.
[03:51:01.610 --> 03:51:05.234]  And by doing so, they're not in control.
[03:51:05.234 --> 03:51:07.937]  They're not steering anymore.
[03:51:07.937 --> 03:51:11.881]  They're steered by something else.
[03:51:11.881 --> 03:51:13.723]  And what is it that all these people want to enact?
[03:51:13.723 --> 03:51:19.630]  They want to enact a new order, a new aeon, a new era that is post-human.
[03:51:20.803 --> 03:51:27.467]  Every one of the global elite that we've analyzed in terms of their books, they're all 100% on the same page when it comes to this.
[03:51:27.467 --> 03:51:28.348]  None of them disagree.
[03:51:28.348 --> 03:51:31.250]  There are no pro-human, pro-life global elites.
[03:51:31.250 --> 03:51:32.050]  You understand that?
[03:51:32.050 --> 03:51:34.392]  None of them.
[03:51:34.392 --> 03:51:43.378]  There are none of them who disagree with a global government, who disagree with a global single CBDC currency.
[03:51:43.378 --> 03:51:48.481]  The BIS guy, the triple chin guy, just came out again and said, Fiat has won.
[03:51:48.481 --> 03:51:50.122]  It has beaten Bitcoin, which is laughable.
[03:51:51.118 --> 03:51:53.619]  He says that we will have the CBDC.
[03:51:53.619 --> 03:51:56.541]  We will have it and we'll shut your wallets off.
[03:51:56.541 --> 03:51:58.662]  You will be under total control for anything that you say.
[03:51:58.662 --> 03:52:03.505]  That's ESG.
[03:52:03.505 --> 03:52:14.151]  This technocratic system was designed out of RAND, CIA, World War II, Cold War operations.
[03:52:16.241 --> 03:52:28.131]  Studying all of the conflicts to figure out the best techniques and mechanisms to control and manage populations through tech, through smart cities.
[03:52:28.131 --> 03:52:40.622]  For example, in the Phoenix Program book that we analyzed by Doug Valentine, we learned that FEMA and Homeland Security were set up on the models of the Phoenix Program and on the models of Vietnam and population reorganization studies.
[03:52:41.610 --> 03:52:50.055]  We learned that in Vietnam, a lot of the AI and drone technology was first tested out in the Vietnam conflict.
[03:52:50.055 --> 03:53:00.941]  We learned that DARPA and the Pentagon were strategizing and testing out various techniques for masses of population tracking and control in Vietnam.
[03:53:00.941 --> 03:53:02.843]  And subsequent conflicts as well, right?
[03:53:02.843 --> 03:53:10.207]  Desert Storm, we know that people were beginning to be biometrically tracked and traced even at the time of Desert Storm, the Iraq conflict.
[03:53:12.634 --> 03:53:17.396]  And so these power structures are the same power structures that control the global drug trade.
[03:53:17.396 --> 03:53:19.077]  Do you think that these are good people?
[03:53:19.077 --> 03:53:22.199]  They're controlling the global drug trade?
[03:53:22.199 --> 03:53:36.666]  And the insane explosion of heroin production since the last 10, 15, 20 years?
[03:53:36.666 --> 03:53:39.888]  Look at our country being destroyed by legal heroin.
[03:53:41.059 --> 03:53:45.142]  Opioids and illegal opioids.
[03:53:45.142 --> 03:53:54.448]  That's because the Western power structure took over all of the drug networks and lanes in the last 50, 60 years.
[03:53:54.448 --> 03:54:00.091]  And they did that in concert with aligning themselves with organized crime.
[03:54:00.091 --> 03:54:04.214]  As multiple analysts have pointed out, even from the FBI itself, right?
[03:54:04.214 --> 03:54:05.775]  FBI consultant, Paul Williams.
[03:54:08.004 --> 03:54:17.648]  CIA, OSS, they took over all the old drug networks, drug lanes, and what I'm trying to say is that this is what it means to have full spectrum dominance, to have full spectrum control, is to control all these areas of life.
[03:54:17.648 --> 03:54:24.191]  They're not doing it because it's just a hobby, it's fun to do, to study, oh we're nerds.
[03:54:24.191 --> 03:54:26.352]  No, it's about what they are bringing in.
[03:54:26.352 --> 03:54:26.973]  Do you understand?
[03:54:26.973 --> 03:54:31.675]  This is not, this is a real plan.
[03:54:31.675 --> 03:54:32.115]  It's not
[03:54:33.132 --> 03:54:34.493]  Theories.
[03:54:34.493 --> 03:54:36.696]  I wonder what they're going to do.
[03:54:36.696 --> 03:54:39.278]  I mean, they all put in their books what they're going to do.
[03:54:39.278 --> 03:54:43.182]  It's not guesswork.
[03:54:43.182 --> 03:54:46.385]  Now, how they roll this out is guesswork.
[03:54:46.385 --> 03:54:48.848]  We don't know what cards these people are going to play.
[03:54:48.848 --> 03:54:53.132]  A lot of people didn't know for sure.
[03:54:53.132 --> 03:54:55.815]  We didn't know they were going to have this COVID
[03:54:56.610 --> 03:55:04.454]  All this kind of stuff that rolled out, but then after it happens, we look back and we can say, oh, they're running all these drills for the exact same thing.
[03:55:04.454 --> 03:55:11.938]  Crimson Contagion, Clade X, Spars document, Event 201.
[03:55:11.938 --> 03:55:14.879]  And we can see that this is a strategized, rolled out plan.
[03:55:14.879 --> 03:55:26.165]  It's the same with all these Rand Corporation documents that I've been mentioning, all these white papers that plan the future, that plan and strategize a global conflict as one of the cards that can be played.
[03:55:27.777 --> 03:55:32.258]  Literally ran corporation strategies about a war between Russia and the West.
[03:55:32.258 --> 03:55:33.878]  Nuclear strangers, right?
[03:55:33.878 --> 03:55:35.838]  PDD 60 or whatever it is.
[03:55:35.838 --> 03:55:42.560]  Presidential Decision Directive under Clinton of absorbing a nuclear strike, which supposedly has been updated or whatever.
[03:55:42.560 --> 03:55:55.582]  I don't know all the PDDs, but the point is that you do have strategies about this and none of those strategies are made with your welfare in mind.
[03:55:58.237 --> 03:56:12.527]  Because the same people that run giant drug laundering banks like HSBC and all these other banks that got busted 10 years ago for $300 million worth of drug money?
[03:56:12.527 --> 03:56:15.189]  You think that's just random bad apples?
[03:56:15.189 --> 03:56:18.451]  No, that's the people that run the West.
[03:56:18.451 --> 03:56:21.773]  That's the same structure, the same people that we're talking about.
[03:56:21.773 --> 03:56:24.896]  It's Spectre.
[03:56:24.896 --> 03:56:26.557]  And Spectre would like to see a
[03:56:28.562 --> 03:56:33.444]  Destructive war, probably, eventually.
[03:56:33.444 --> 03:56:36.006]  It's definitely one of the cards that they could play.
[03:56:36.006 --> 03:56:40.368]  I mean, I hope there's not going to be a world war, but they could definitely play that card.
[03:56:40.368 --> 03:56:46.270]  They have talked and strategized about it for a long time, the possibility of a new world war.
[03:56:46.270 --> 03:56:48.171]  Now it's more likely than ever.
[03:56:48.171 --> 03:56:49.652]  It's being talked about openly.
[03:56:51.920 --> 03:57:10.408]  And if it happens, it would be because the elite want that to happen, to have a mass destruction, to bring in their post-human world, where we're run by AI, we're run in some kind of new technocratic system, where everything is tracked and traced.
[03:57:10.408 --> 03:57:14.510]  Maybe the elite emerge from underground bunkers after a giant exchange, who knows?
[03:57:16.730 --> 03:57:18.810]  But that's definitely one of the cards that they could play.
[03:57:18.810 --> 03:57:20.211]  We have to keep that in mind.
[03:57:20.211 --> 03:57:22.191]  And another pandemic is another card they could play.
[03:57:22.191 --> 03:57:23.651]  They could play both cards.
[03:57:23.651 --> 03:57:26.192]  So we have to be prepared for these things because these are realities.
[03:57:26.192 --> 03:57:28.092]  That's the world that we live in.
[03:57:28.092 --> 03:57:32.553]  And if we don't realize what's going on, it's just going to be all the worse for us.
[03:57:32.553 --> 03:57:34.954]  If you want to get my books, go to Jay's Analysis.
[03:57:34.954 --> 03:57:36.074]  You can buy my books in the shop.
[03:57:36.074 --> 03:57:37.274]  Sign copies.
[03:57:37.274 --> 03:57:40.255]  You can follow me over on Rockfin as well.
[03:57:40.255 --> 03:57:45.516]  And go to the Infrawar store and get all those products there and support Alex, the tip of the spear.
[03:57:47.185 --> 03:57:49.166]  I've got some good news.
[03:57:49.166 --> 03:57:56.031]  Our high-quality supplements really work, and we have about an 80% reorder rate with customers.
[03:57:56.031 --> 03:57:56.871]  That's the good news.
[03:57:56.871 --> 03:57:58.012]  They're amazing.
[03:57:58.012 --> 03:58:06.198]  The bad news is, around 1% or a little less of our actual viewers and listeners ever go to InfoWareStore.com and ever actually buy the products.
[03:58:06.198 --> 03:58:09.640]  So you're missing out on these products, plus it funds the InfoWare.
[03:58:09.640 --> 03:58:14.563]  Think of what we've done with just 1% of our massive audience actually buying products.
[03:58:14.563 --> 03:58:15.384]  Think what would happen.
[03:58:16.304 --> 03:58:29.833]  If those of you on the fence actually went to InfoWarStore.com and got some of these amazing products, I would recommend Turmeric 95 for your joints, your bones, inflammation, to get one of the biggest effects, so you reorder it and see how great it is.
[03:58:29.833 --> 03:58:38.819]  Also, we've got the super high-quality, full-spectrum CBD oil that's so good for your neurological systems, your brain, your joints, your bones, as well.
[03:58:38.819 --> 03:58:40.200]  Or Real Red Pill Plus.
[03:58:40.200 --> 03:58:44.603]  Just go try the product, fund the InfoWar, and help us defeat the new order together.
[03:58:44.603 --> 03:58:45.944]  InfoWarStore.com.
[03:58:47.405 --> 03:58:51.327]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[03:58:51.327 --> 03:58:55.290]  A flying disc has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[03:58:55.290 --> 03:58:57.672]  Here is a bulletin from CBS News.
[03:58:57.672 --> 03:58:59.293]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[03:59:00.066 --> 03:59:03.409]  This is a different kind of war.
[03:59:03.409 --> 03:59:06.752]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets.
[03:59:06.752 --> 03:59:11.276]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[03:59:11.276 --> 03:59:15.299]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[03:59:15.299 --> 03:59:17.921]  It was almost as if it were a plan imposed.
[03:59:17.921 --> 03:59:19.082]  It just can't end.
[03:59:19.082 --> 03:59:21.324]  We need to go into the capital, fast!
[03:59:22.686 --> 03:59:25.328]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[03:59:25.328 --> 03:59:26.949]  They are nothing but distractions.
[03:59:26.949 --> 03:59:29.171]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[03:59:29.171 --> 03:59:31.633]  You silenced those voices.
[03:59:31.633 --> 03:59:35.817]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[03:59:35.817 --> 03:59:41.802]  As soon as we start exposing the Great Reset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison!
[03:59:48.502 --> 03:59:54.417]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
