[00:00.000 --> 00:28.160]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:28.160 --> 00:34.600]  We are live on the Alex Jones show, it is Wednesday the 19th of April here in Austin,
[00:34.600 --> 00:35.600]  Texas.
[00:35.600 --> 00:39.920]  Another jam-packed show, three guests, no less than three guests today.
[00:39.920 --> 00:44.320]  We have Roger Stone coming up at the bottom of the hour to talk all things Trump.
[00:44.320 --> 00:50.200]  We have Mike Cernovich coming up in the second hour to break more exclusive stories from
[00:50.200 --> 00:51.200]  his perspective.
[00:51.200 --> 00:55.960]  Obviously, he's been taken on the mainstream media and beating them at their own game.
[00:55.960 --> 00:57.120]  So that's going to be exciting.
[00:57.120 --> 01:02.840]  And then in the third hour, Andrew Torber, the founder of GAB, this is the new alternative
[01:02.840 --> 01:03.840]  to Twitter.
[01:03.840 --> 01:07.240]  People have been asking for a new social network to take them on.
[01:07.240 --> 01:08.240]  He's done it.
[01:08.240 --> 01:09.240]  He's created it.
[01:09.240 --> 01:11.640]  He's set it up and he is in studio in the third hour.
[01:11.640 --> 01:16.800]  So absolutely action-packed show, ton of news to cover as well.
[01:16.800 --> 01:22.160]  We have an MSNBC analyst, and this is one of the top stories up on infowords.com.
[01:22.160 --> 01:28.560]  An MSNBC analyst calling for ISIS to bomb a Trump property in Turkey.
[01:28.560 --> 01:33.240]  Now, I've talked before about how the far left, at least in terms of their rhetoric.
[01:33.240 --> 01:37.200]  I'm not saying they're all going to go off to Syria and fight for ISIS, but in terms
[01:37.200 --> 01:42.240]  of their rhetoric, they're merging with Jihadists.
[01:42.240 --> 01:43.920]  They're spouting the same rhetoric.
[01:43.920 --> 01:50.280]  And don't forget, ISIS in their own manifesto, we report on this about a year ago, put out
[01:50.280 --> 01:54.640]  that the far left and Jihadists broadly share the same goal, and that they would try to
[01:54.640 --> 01:58.440]  recruit the far left towards their ideology.
[01:58.440 --> 01:59.960]  What have we seen in the months since?
[01:59.960 --> 02:06.560]  We've seen feminists chanting Allah Akbar at their big protests, their anti-Trump protests.
[02:06.560 --> 02:13.360]  We've seen top prominent journalists tweeting, calling for Trump's assassination on Twitter
[02:13.360 --> 02:15.760]  directly over and over again.
[02:15.760 --> 02:22.120]  Now we have an MSNBC analyst nominates Trump property for next ISIS bombing.
[02:22.120 --> 02:25.080]  Don't forget, I talked about it on Monday.
[02:25.080 --> 02:31.000]  The New York Times is encouraging Trump to leave ISIS alone in Syria, to even support
[02:31.000 --> 02:32.680]  them to some extent.
[02:32.680 --> 02:37.760]  This is coalescing around a very chilling rhetorical alliance between Jihadists and
[02:37.760 --> 02:38.760]  the far left.
[02:38.760 --> 02:44.760]  An MSNBC counter-terrorism analyst is under fire after suggesting that ISIS should bomb
[02:44.760 --> 02:48.400]  a property belonging to US President Donald Trump.
[02:48.400 --> 02:53.480]  Malcolm Nance, who regularly appears on MSNBC programming, and he's got history, which we'll
[02:53.480 --> 02:58.600]  go through in a minute, took to Twitter Tuesday and expressed hope that Islamic State terrorists
[02:58.600 --> 03:01.600]  would bomb the president's property in Turkey.
[03:01.600 --> 03:08.680]  He actually said it in a tweet, quote, this is my nominee for the first ISIS suicide bombing
[03:08.680 --> 03:14.720]  of a Trump property Nance tweeted in response to a picture of Trump Tower building in Istanbul.
[03:14.720 --> 03:19.480]  He deleted the tweet, but the internet doesn't forget.
[03:19.480 --> 03:24.600]  Now this guy is a counter-terror analyst, that's not forget that, counter-terror.
[03:24.600 --> 03:30.380]  But he has a history of denying that ISIS-inspired attacks have anything to do with Islam.
[03:30.380 --> 03:34.920]  When an extremist plowed a truck into innocent people in Nice, France last year after reading
[03:34.920 --> 03:41.240]  ISIS materials advocating such forms of attack, Nance suggested the driver was just mentally
[03:41.240 --> 03:45.160]  unstable rather than following any ideology.
[03:45.160 --> 03:50.040]  He described the attack as the driver taking, quote, a moment to challenge society in a
[03:50.040 --> 03:51.520]  horrific way.
[03:51.520 --> 03:54.360]  Now imagine if you were the parents of what?
[03:54.360 --> 04:00.960]  One of those 10 children killed in that Nice attack, an Islamist barreling a truck, dismantling
[04:00.960 --> 04:08.200]  people limb from limb, you've lost your child and this guy gets up on MSNBC and says that
[04:08.200 --> 04:12.400]  the culprit, the terrorist, was just challenging society.
[04:12.400 --> 04:19.640]  Again, this is the merger of rhetorical violence between the far left and the ISIS jihadists.
[04:19.640 --> 04:24.800]  They're legitimizing the grievances because again they broadly share the same grievances
[04:24.800 --> 04:30.240]  if you drill down into it based in their hatred of the West, their hatred of America.
[04:30.240 --> 04:37.480]  Now he's actually tweeting encouraging ISIS to bomb a Trump building and it gets even
[04:37.480 --> 04:41.000]  worse than that as we saw what happened in Fresno yesterday.
[04:41.000 --> 04:43.600]  We will get on to talk about it on the Alex Jones show live.
[04:43.600 --> 04:50.400]  You also have PBS encouraging Tid kids to be taught about suicide bombings.
[04:50.400 --> 04:54.960]  PBS absolutely shocking alliance of the far left in Islam.
[04:54.960 --> 04:57.040]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones show live.
[04:57.040 --> 05:00.040]  Don't go away.
[05:00.040 --> 05:06.400]  According to the mainstream media, President Donald Trump was mean to kids on Easter Sunday.
[05:06.400 --> 05:07.400]  That's right.
[05:07.400 --> 05:13.040]  Dozens of news outlets ran with a misleading video that was spread by Politico yesterday
[05:13.040 --> 05:18.080]  claiming that President Trump signed a kids make America great again hat and then threw
[05:18.080 --> 05:20.880]  it away from the kid into the crowd.
[05:20.880 --> 05:26.280]  The video quickly went viral racking up nearly 10,000 retweets and getting picked up by other
[05:26.280 --> 05:27.600]  news outlets.
[05:27.600 --> 05:32.840]  The Washington Post reported Trump using a thick sharpie put his signature on the bill
[05:32.840 --> 05:39.040]  of the cap then looked up and lobbed it into the crowd nowhere near the hand that had given
[05:39.040 --> 05:40.040]  it to him.
[05:40.040 --> 05:44.880]  BuzzFeed even claimed that the poor kid never got his hat back but in reality other camera
[05:44.880 --> 05:50.480]  angles clearly show the president and the kid were just having fun and the boy indeed
[05:50.480 --> 05:54.920]  caught his hat signed by the president of the United States.
[05:54.920 --> 06:24.440]  You can see the videos for yourself right now at Infowars.com.

[06:58.840 --> 07:02.600]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight. This is the time to support info wars
[07:02.600 --> 07:05.160]  We've had an Easter special that I've decided to extend for another week
[07:05.160 --> 07:08.240]  It is a great empowering thing for me personally
[07:08.240 --> 07:15.240]  Big underglobal slug and as the enemy turns up the wattage every action has an opposite equal reaction God or the good force in the universe
[07:15.240 --> 07:18.720]  Turns up my power. So let me explain something. This is a great voyage
[07:18.720 --> 07:24.920]  I'm on I know you're on it with me the animating contest of liberty that Thomas Jefferson talked about is the paramount vehicle
[07:24.920 --> 07:29.760]  This whole world is a test and this experiment that we're all part of is key
[07:29.760 --> 07:35.400]  You're conscious and alive and you care and the fact you're even involved and are even searching for the truth shows
[07:35.400 --> 07:39.480]  You're conscious and haven't been pulled under by these dark forces that now dominate our world
[07:39.480 --> 07:44.200]  So whether you get our great products and support the broadcast whether you pray for us whether you just spread the word about the links
[07:44.200 --> 07:47.240]  It doesn't matter just being conscious and awake connects us all together
[07:47.240 --> 07:52.340]  And this is an incredible moment to be alive from Alex Jones with the entire info wars comm family and force live comm
[07:52.400 --> 07:55.560]  Saluting all of you no matter what color your skin is where you came from in the world
[07:55.560 --> 07:58.040]  What your religious background is we are unstoppable together
[07:58.040 --> 08:16.200]  You found it the tip of the spear it is the Alex Jones show and now your host Paul Joseph Watson
[08:16.200 --> 08:27.440]  So we have an MSNBC counter terror analyst
[08:28.480 --> 08:33.720]  Getting up on Twitter and encouraging ISIS to attack Trump's building in Istanbul, Turkey
[08:34.760 --> 08:42.360]  Shocking in isolation, but not given the history of the far left aligning itself with Islamist rhetoric
[08:42.360 --> 08:52.920]  Gateway pundit also reports today on a related subject. Your tax dollars at work PBS teaches kids about the glory of Islamic suicide bombings
[08:52.920 --> 09:00.200]  PBS is running a series of lesson plans that glorify Islamic suicide bombings. It's called dying to be a martyr
[09:00.200 --> 09:07.480]  In which students learn about the struggles a would-be suicide bomber must deal with before ripping himself and the innocents around him to shreds
[09:07.480 --> 09:16.200]  So again, it's sympathizing with Palestinian suicide bombers and it teaches your kids the glory of martyrdom
[09:16.200 --> 09:23.800]  Again, the public broads casting service PBS is home to Big Bird frontline another programming made possible by viewers like you
[09:23.800 --> 09:32.280]  Including lesson plans instructing teachers how to show kids to be more sympathetic to radical Islamic suicide bombers in Palestine
[09:32.280 --> 09:40.120]  They literally call it dying to be a martyr. Now this ties into what happened yesterday in Fresno
[09:40.120 --> 09:46.120]  Of course, we had the triple murder of three people happened yesterday morning the culprit
[09:46.120 --> 09:54.680]  Corey Ali Mohammed reports the LA Times in the headline hate crime is suspected after a government kills three white men in downtown Fresno
[09:54.680 --> 10:00.120]  Corey Ali Mohammed told his family there was a war going on between blacks and whites in America
[10:00.120 --> 10:08.280]  This was clearly racially motivated but more than that and they're not admitting this we're going to play this video shortly where he
[10:08.280 --> 10:17.240]  openly talks about taking vengeance upon America a clear political dimension a clear political motivation behind the shooting
[10:17.240 --> 10:20.040]  They're saying it's not terrorism
[10:20.040 --> 10:24.920]  The LA Times goes on to report on social media. He referred to white people as devils
[10:24.920 --> 10:33.720]  Earlier in the year he released a rap album replete with violent explicit racially charged lyrics including one referring to himself as a black soldier
[10:33.720 --> 10:39.400]  So after he shot these three people dead random white people on the streets of Fresno
[10:39.400 --> 10:51.400]  He shouted Allah Akbar while being arrested by police officers. He also expressed resentment hatred towards white people and the government according to
[10:51.400 --> 11:01.800]  Fresno police chief Jerry Dyer. So this was all admitted within an hour of this shooting happening that it was driven by his hatred towards white people
[11:01.800 --> 11:09.960]  He said Allah Akbar after the attack while he was being arrested. Clear racial dimension clear political motivation
[11:09.960 --> 11:18.520]  Then we dug into his actual Facebook page which was live for about two hours after the shooting before it started picking up media attention
[11:18.520 --> 11:24.520]  There you see one post out of his Facebook calling Steve Bannon a white devil
[11:24.520 --> 11:38.040]  There's also another post in there where he expresses hatred towards Trump and Pence so clearly driven radicalized by the mainstream media's hysterical anti-Trump rhetoric
[11:38.040 --> 11:46.760]  He was their creation. Then we went on who he liked on Facebook. Obviously you can look at the the media organizations that people follow
[11:46.760 --> 11:53.080]  And it was CNN, MSNBC, Young Turks, a whole host of Black Lives Matter groups
[11:53.080 --> 12:01.880]  People like Van Jones, people like Sean King, the BLM icon and a bunch of basically social justice warrior groups
[12:01.880 --> 12:06.920]  So again every time there's a shooting, every time there's an incident, pizza gate
[12:06.920 --> 12:11.640]  You can look at Richard Poplowski in Seattle back in 2009
[12:11.640 --> 12:18.440]  Any connection, if they browsed info wars once we immediately get labeled with the blame
[12:18.440 --> 12:25.400]  Even though in the case of Poplowski in Seattle, he gunned down some police officers back in 2009
[12:25.400 --> 12:29.800]  He openly said he didn't even like Alex Jones yet we still got blamed for that attack
[12:29.800 --> 12:32.440]  Well it cuts both ways
[12:32.440 --> 12:43.240]  This guy was a radicalized militant social justice warrior and when that narrative started to emerge on Twitter in the hours after the shooting
[12:43.240 --> 12:47.080]  There was a huge backlash from his fellow social justice warriors
[12:47.080 --> 12:49.880]  Which goes back to the point that I make over and over again
[12:49.880 --> 12:52.920]  The right disavows its fringe extremists
[12:52.920 --> 13:00.920]  No one's denying that they're a fringe extremist who commit violence on the right. The difference is we disavow them, we don't encourage their rhetoric
[13:00.920 --> 13:05.800]  We don't march down the street chanting what do we want dead cops when do we want it now
[13:05.800 --> 13:08.600]  Like Black Lives Matter protesters do
[13:08.600 --> 13:14.120]  We don't go on Twitter and hashtag kill all black people but they do it
[13:14.840 --> 13:23.720]  You know kill all white people we've seen the hashtags we've seen this constant drumbeat of trying to make anti-white racism trendy and cool
[13:23.720 --> 13:29.320]  Huffington Post just a few days ago had an article should we ban white people from voting
[13:29.320 --> 13:31.320]  Because that's progressive now
[13:31.320 --> 13:42.280]  You know we've had MTV resolutions for white people a backlash to that but they still carry on with this intense radicalization agenda trying to make it cool and trendy
[13:42.280 --> 13:48.840]  Does that mean that the people who view those videos or read those articles are going to go out and kill white people? No
[13:48.840 --> 13:50.440]  But again
[13:50.440 --> 13:58.520]  We get blamed for every single attack if there's a thread of connection if they browsed in four wars once there you see the Huffington Post
[13:58.520 --> 14:02.200]  Could it be time to deny white men the the franchise the right to vote?
[14:03.400 --> 14:10.920]  We've documented this at every single stage you had an MTV show last year with white people crying over their guilt
[14:11.640 --> 14:13.960]  with the close-up on their distraught faces
[14:15.240 --> 14:19.640]  The left the progressives the social justice warriors have created this meme
[14:20.200 --> 14:26.120]  And now there's a backlash in the form of dead victims on the streets of Fresno
[14:26.120 --> 14:34.040]  Again, we've seen the constant reinforcement of the argument. You know, you've heard it white people can't be racist because they've got institutional power
[14:35.960 --> 14:44.280]  White people, you know, this guy was racist for screaming about how he hated white people while gun gunning them down in broad daylight, but it's not
[14:44.760 --> 14:52.040]  Political it's not even a hate crime. Some of them were saying I got absolutely trashed on Twitter by a lot of these leftists
[14:52.600 --> 14:54.600]  Simply for pointing out these connections
[14:54.600 --> 14:59.240]  I'll give you an example and if you go on my Twitter page, you can see all this from yesterday
[14:59.880 --> 15:01.880]  Charles Clymer tweeted
[15:02.440 --> 15:09.160]  If your fragile white feelings are what's being slaughtered that doesn't qualify as a terrorist attack. Sorry kiddo try again
[15:10.440 --> 15:16.440]  So his concern wasn't for the victims. His concern was people were saying it was a terrorist attack when it clearly was
[15:16.440 --> 15:25.560]  Let's roll the video where this guy talks about taking vengeance against America. Let's go to that clip
[15:28.760 --> 15:30.760]  Apparently
[15:33.080 --> 15:37.720]  Y'all racist graph the white devils and you tombs and fud niggas by taking the serious
[15:39.160 --> 15:41.960]  We will continue to bring destruction and wrath upon
[15:41.960 --> 15:46.360]  America until we establish a kingdom of infinite peace and progress
[15:47.240 --> 15:49.240]  That's what we're doing
[15:49.720 --> 15:51.720]  All this
[15:54.280 --> 15:56.280]  We have greater work to do
[15:56.360 --> 15:58.360]  That's a lot we're talking about
[15:59.720 --> 16:02.200]  Salamu alaykum ala wa ala wa akbar
[16:05.240 --> 16:08.360]  So there you have it he's talking about vengeance. He's saying a lot of akbar
[16:08.360 --> 16:16.120]  This is clearly political you go on his facebook page. You look at his posts before they deleted them black militant groups
[16:16.120 --> 16:20.840]  You know the kind that marched down the street with rifles chanting for dead cops like blm did in new york
[16:22.280 --> 16:23.640]  But again, we have this narrative
[16:23.640 --> 16:29.080]  It's impossible for you know black people to be racist against white people because white people have institutional power
[16:29.320 --> 16:33.320]  Was this guy racist for screaming about how he hated white people
[16:33.320 --> 16:39.080]  While gunning them down in the street in broad daylight. Well, of course, that's a racist hate crime
[16:39.320 --> 16:41.400]  But they won't even acknowledge that a lot of them
[16:41.880 --> 16:44.360]  He followed, you know blm leader shorn king
[16:44.440 --> 16:49.400]  He was clearly radicalized by some of this rhetoric and yet people on twitter
[16:50.120 --> 16:54.120]  Wouldn't have it because it crushed that narrative. How is cnn?
[16:54.280 --> 16:59.640]  How is buzzfeed going to defend this narrative when this guy has clearly been radicalized?
[16:59.640 --> 17:05.560]  He's been turned to this fringe violent extreme action by their rhetoric that we've seen over and over again
[17:05.960 --> 17:10.680]  The anti trump stuff the hysteria the trump derangement syndrome
[17:11.480 --> 17:15.640]  But you know people are up on twitter claiming that this issue was trending in fresno
[17:15.720 --> 17:19.560]  Not because it was a multiple victim shooting because it was a huge breaking story
[17:19.880 --> 17:24.680]  But because bots were pushing it to the top of twitter trending
[17:24.680 --> 17:30.200]  Again any narrative that goes against them any narrative that they can't defend
[17:30.840 --> 17:35.080]  With their insane hysterical rhetoric they claim that it's bots
[17:36.200 --> 17:40.120]  And then this whole terrorism angle every time there's a mass shooting every time there's a
[17:40.760 --> 17:45.560]  Even a limited shooting, you know one or two victims and a white perpetrator
[17:46.360 --> 17:52.600]  What does the left do they get up on twitter they demand it be characterized as a terrorist attack
[17:52.600 --> 17:55.960]  With no information coming in whatsoever. Who's the culprit?
[17:55.960 --> 17:59.720]  He's white. It's a terrorist attack. And yes, there are terrorist attack dylan roof
[18:00.360 --> 18:08.760]  Racist hate crime obviously politically motivated. Yes, it was a terrorist attack. Let's call a spade a spade. Let's not blame trucks
[18:09.720 --> 18:12.920]  Like cnn and the new york times did after the niece incident
[18:12.920 --> 18:17.160]  Let's blame the actual perpetrator and look into the motivations behind it
[18:17.160 --> 18:22.920]  Which was publicly available within two hours after this attack before they pulled it down
[18:25.160 --> 18:27.160]  But it was the narrative of you know
[18:27.480 --> 18:32.600]  The usual alt-right accounts are spreading dis info about this. That's what I got on twitter
[18:32.840 --> 18:40.280]  How is it dis info to point out the guy's facebook post where he's calling people white devils where he's posting anti-trump stuff
[18:40.600 --> 18:45.160]  Where he follows all these militant liberation groups where he supports black lives matter
[18:45.160 --> 18:51.480]  Clearly, he was motivated by that. He was talking about it in the clip. He was screaming alla akbar
[18:52.040 --> 18:54.040]  After he committed this triple murder
[18:54.600 --> 18:59.240]  But what did the associated press report in the immediate aftermath of this?
[19:00.200 --> 19:06.040]  Fake news ap translates killers alla akbar to english claims. He said god is great. This is out the american mirror
[19:06.760 --> 19:09.640]  And they actually tweeted and now they've deleted it
[19:09.640 --> 19:16.120]  That this guy said god is great after he committed this triple murder the police hours before
[19:16.600 --> 19:20.360]  Had gone on record to say that he had said alla akbar
[19:20.680 --> 19:22.680]  But the associated press
[19:22.760 --> 19:28.200]  Just decided to translate that to help people understand things and it became god is great
[19:28.200 --> 19:33.080]  Well, obviously the reason for them doing that is to disguise the fact that he's invoking
[19:33.640 --> 19:37.560]  A muslim god to disguise the fact that that's obviously what terrorists say
[19:37.560 --> 19:41.640]  Before every single major terrorist attack a very
[19:42.360 --> 19:46.120]  Inconvenient narrative for the mainstream media and they tried to flip it round
[19:46.360 --> 19:54.120]  But they completely failed but again the far left is merging with islamist rhetoric and now it's spilling out onto the streets

[23:03.560 --> 23:09.640]  In the early 1980s a child was born two of them actually their names were jeff and andy time went by
[23:09.640 --> 23:15.560]  They developed facial hair and one day something happened andy got ripped off buying overpriced razors
[23:15.880 --> 23:21.160]  So they decided to start their own shaving company and fix shaving once and for all they hired the best designers
[23:21.400 --> 23:28.360]  They bought a 95 year old german blade factory and they started selling high quality razors online with no up charging direct to customers
[23:28.760 --> 23:32.760]  How did the overpriced razor company respond by threatening to sue their pants off?

[24:05.880 --> 24:11.480]  Trouble so hard don't nobody know my trouble for god
[24:12.600 --> 24:16.040]  Don't nobody know my trouble for god
[24:17.080 --> 24:19.080]  Oh
[24:19.320 --> 24:21.320]  Trouble so hard
[24:21.800 --> 24:25.160]  We are back live on the alex jon chome the question we're asking is
[24:25.160 --> 24:29.160]  You know is the mainstream media's violent racist rhetoric inspiring
[24:29.720 --> 24:34.360]  Domestic terrorists to kill people we had this tragic incident in fresno yesterday
[24:34.600 --> 24:39.880]  The guy was obviously motivated by this anti trump hysteria this black lives matter rhetoric
[24:40.280 --> 24:46.040]  He called the guy who shot the cops in dallas who again was inspired by this anti white hatred
[24:46.200 --> 24:50.680]  He called him a hero a hero on his own facebook page
[24:50.680 --> 24:57.240]  Has he been radicalized by this far left propaganda? Will they disavow?
[24:58.200 --> 25:03.480]  You know he had the same rhetoric as an sjw combined a little bit with an islamist
[25:03.480 --> 25:08.520]  This is the toxic combination. I've been warning about there. You see his facebook page our hero
[25:09.480 --> 25:12.920]  There's the guy who'd gone down the what was it eight nine cops in dallas
[25:13.880 --> 25:15.880]  last summer
[25:15.880 --> 25:22.040]  You crawl through his entire facebook page. It's a born-long litany of social justice hysteria
[25:22.280 --> 25:26.600]  The far left is merging with islamism and we need to call it out for what it is
[25:27.000 --> 25:29.800]  Because this is going to cause more violent episodes
[25:30.120 --> 25:34.360]  Again, i'm not saying that they're all going to fly off to syria and fight for isis obviously not
[25:34.840 --> 25:38.440]  But this is going to cause more deaths. I put out a tweet months ago warning
[25:38.920 --> 25:41.160]  That this trump derangement syndrome there you see
[25:41.160 --> 25:47.400]  Black lives matter supporters celebrating the murder of the dallas cops back in july last year
[25:48.040 --> 25:50.040]  But i put out a tweet months ago
[25:50.280 --> 25:53.720]  Warning the social justice warriors are going to go g-hat
[25:54.280 --> 25:59.640]  And this shooting in fresno was this cori muhammad's own personal g-hat
[25:59.880 --> 26:03.640]  But what were the left concerned about in the immediate aftermath?
[26:04.200 --> 26:09.000]  Is another tweet directed at me by a social justice warrior after this incident?
[26:09.000 --> 26:14.440]  Oh look sernovich possebeck and watson are all pushing the exact same narrative about fresno
[26:14.920 --> 26:22.120]  All at the same time imagine that well. Yeah, we were covering a breaking news story about a multiple victim
[26:22.520 --> 26:25.320]  shooting and stating the known facts
[26:25.960 --> 26:27.960]  Imagine that god forbid
[26:28.440 --> 26:33.480]  They were so afraid of us even talking about it because again it looked
[26:34.280 --> 26:38.280]  Really bad for their narrative. It's very hard to spin something like that
[26:38.280 --> 26:45.960]  That when a social justice warrior militant leftist black lives matter supporting anti trump extremist
[26:46.280 --> 26:54.120]  Who shattered a la akbar who is also an islamist guns down three people randomly on the streets in the broad daylight?
[26:54.440 --> 27:00.920]  Very hard to spin that narrative and turn it back on the right again the right disavows its fringe extremists
[27:01.160 --> 27:06.040]  The left only ever encourages them and that came to light again in what happened
[27:06.040 --> 27:10.760]  And tragically in fresno yesterday, but we have some breaking news out of
[27:11.480 --> 27:15.560]  The new yorker and this was probably many people foresaw it
[27:16.600 --> 27:19.880]  Sources fox news has decided bill o'reilly has to go
[27:20.440 --> 27:26.600]  The murdox have decided bill o'reilly's 21 year run at fox news will come to an end according to sources briefed on the discussions
[27:27.320 --> 27:34.360]  Network executives are preparing to announce o'reilly's departure before he returns from his vacation on april 24th now the big question
[27:34.360 --> 27:37.960]  Or how the exit will look and who will replace him?
[27:38.040 --> 27:43.320]  Obviously, they just got took a colson into one of those prime time slots after the departure of meg and kelly
[27:43.800 --> 27:45.800]  But I think we all saw that coming
[27:45.800 --> 27:49.880]  He was basically drummed out not to excuse his behavior. He's obviously a
[27:50.440 --> 27:53.400]  You know the accusations some of them have been proven true
[27:53.800 --> 28:01.080]  But it was a witch hunt by the left to get him out of there four million viewers on a on a nightly basis on a good night
[28:01.080 --> 28:04.760]  You know, they they've been trying to get him out for a while and there's another article
[28:05.560 --> 28:11.320]  Out of american mirror which ties into this email shows media matters orchestrating bill o'reilly smear campaign
[28:11.880 --> 28:19.240]  Again media matters the group that used to meet on a weekly basis with barack obama to coordinate their agenda
[28:19.320 --> 28:25.480]  They used to brag about how they wrote the editorials for msnbc every single day
[28:25.480 --> 28:33.720]  Media matters the group that attacks us on a daily basis. They've got people listening right now to every single word
[28:34.280 --> 28:39.640]  Visually transcribing everything so they can spin it out of context and attack us again
[28:40.440 --> 28:45.640]  They used to write bought her articles whining about how matt drudge linked to us like four years ago
[28:45.960 --> 28:48.360]  Which was pretty funny because I told matt drudge about that
[28:49.240 --> 28:51.240]  And because of it. He said he would link to us
[28:51.240 --> 28:56.040]  Five times more. So thank you very much media matters after every single attack
[28:56.280 --> 28:59.240]  We get bigger and bigger but as that article explains
[28:59.720 --> 29:03.400]  They directly targeted his advertisers and that's what the left does
[29:04.040 --> 29:09.160]  They can't compete on a level playing field. They can't win the argument in a fair fight
[29:09.320 --> 29:14.840]  So they always dig for the personal for the private. They always attack on a financial
[29:15.480 --> 29:18.200]  On a financial assault course because again
[29:18.200 --> 29:24.280]  They don't have an argument. They use the rights principles against them. They make it personal
[29:24.440 --> 29:27.640]  They go after people's private lives because they can't compete
[29:27.960 --> 29:31.000]  They can't resonate when it comes to having an actual
[29:31.560 --> 29:35.400]  Argument and we've seen that happen again with bill o'reilly who it now looks like
[29:35.960 --> 29:38.840]  Is hanging on by a thread or is about to leave fox news?
[29:38.840 --> 29:49.720]  We will be back with more news on the alex jones show life breaking news at info wars.com. Don't go away
[30:09.800 --> 30:18.680]  Shouted a la akbar before he pulled the trigger and police are now saying that Muhammad had expressed hatred towards white people
[30:18.840 --> 30:22.360]  And the government in fact if you take a look at his facebook page
[30:22.600 --> 30:27.240]  You'll notice a meme he posted recently about white house chief strategist
[30:27.480 --> 30:31.400]  Steve vannon who according to Muhammad is a white devil
[30:31.400 --> 30:39.720]  But on the other hand the fresno killer says he does like msnbc cnn van jones the young turks
[30:39.960 --> 30:47.560]  And of course black lives matter so far it's unclear if his rampage was based on watching left-wing media
[30:47.800 --> 30:54.600]  Inspired by blm or his religion. We will continue to bring destruction to back of prime america

[35:32.280 --> 35:37.800]  But it is easy to get them right now at info wars store.com with all those huge
[35:38.360 --> 35:45.080]  Easter mega special discounts extended, but that sale must end tonight
[35:45.480 --> 35:50.840]  So don't wait around because those discounts are not going to be around for much longer at info wars store
[35:51.480 --> 35:53.000]  com
[35:53.000 --> 35:56.920]  Now we got roger stone. Hopefully coming up later in this hour to talk about all things
[35:57.480 --> 35:58.360]  Trump for the moment
[35:58.360 --> 36:02.680]  We're going to dip back into the news and speaking of trump and speaking of fake news
[36:03.160 --> 36:09.000]  We had ap tweeting that the killer in fresno said god is great. He didn't say god is great
[36:09.000 --> 36:14.280]  He said a la akbar, but that's not convenient for their narrative. So they just changed his words entirely
[36:14.840 --> 36:16.520]  fake news
[36:16.520 --> 36:23.000]  Now we have this out of information liberation media claimed trump threw kids hat into crowd after signing it video shows
[36:23.000 --> 36:29.240]  Otherwise dozens of news outlets ran with a misleading video spread by politico on monday to claim
[36:29.800 --> 36:34.040]  President trump signed a kid's maga hat and threw it callously into a crowd
[36:35.000 --> 36:39.000]  From the freebie can quote a kid asked trump to sign his hat at the white house
[36:39.000 --> 36:43.800]  He said roll the president signs and then tosses the hat into the crowd. That's what politico
[36:44.520 --> 36:45.640]  tweeted
[36:45.640 --> 36:53.880]  And that's what dozens of other media outlets tweeted it went viral. Here you see trump signing the hat kid gives him the hat
[36:53.880 --> 36:58.040]  He signs it in a second tosses it up into the air how callous
[36:59.000 --> 37:03.240]  How callous of trumpy does it again later on but if you look at the other angle
[37:04.040 --> 37:06.040]  If you go to the second video
[37:07.880 --> 37:09.880]  You can see the kid in the back
[37:10.920 --> 37:13.080]  Reaching over gives trump the hat
[37:13.080 --> 37:15.880]  You'll see it in a second tosses it up
[37:16.600 --> 37:20.120]  Kid catches it same one who gave him the hat and then he walks off
[37:20.840 --> 37:26.120]  So he wasn't callously tossing it into the crowd as if he didn't care who received it
[37:26.440 --> 37:32.840]  But dozens of them reported that that was the case not even showing the video from the other angle
[37:33.560 --> 37:39.480]  So again buzzfeed claimed in a tweet that the poor kid ended up quote without a hat
[37:39.480 --> 37:42.520]  You just got the hat. You could see it in the video
[37:43.560 --> 37:49.400]  Google news showed dozens of other outlets who ran with the video without any skepticism and the majority of yet to issue any
[37:49.720 --> 37:51.960]  Corrections and these are the fact checkers
[37:52.600 --> 37:57.480]  That are going to verify all our facebook posts. These are the guys buzzfeed news
[37:58.360 --> 38:05.080]  Guy without a hat after trump throws it. Well, he's not without a hat because he threw it directly to him as you just saw in the video
[38:05.080 --> 38:12.680]  This is fake news. This is buzzfeed. This is politico. These are the people fact checking our facebook posts and they can't even get a
[38:13.240 --> 38:15.400]  basic damn thing right like this
[38:16.200 --> 38:18.200]  Absolutely incredible
[38:18.760 --> 38:20.760]  Talking about fake news
[38:21.080 --> 38:25.320]  And actually this is good from buzzfeed. They did one good thing. They reported the truth
[38:25.800 --> 38:28.040]  A broken clock is right at twice a day, I guess
[38:28.040 --> 38:34.680]  Buzzfeed reports people are saying that chelsea clinton is never going to happen after she was honored by this magazine
[38:34.920 --> 38:39.400]  So variety came out with this cover power of women new york
[38:40.200 --> 38:48.520]  And it featured chelsea clinton on the cover. Yes, they're still trying to ram the clintons down the throats of the american people
[38:49.080 --> 38:55.800]  They tried to make her look cool an editor from variety speaking about that picture right there tweeted
[38:55.800 --> 38:59.800]  How cool does chelsea clinton look and our power of women new york cover?
[39:00.280 --> 39:02.280]  Well people responded
[39:02.280 --> 39:10.280]  Yeah, not so cool. Some of the responses an empire in total decline can sell unaccomplished nepotism as cool to its people
[39:11.400 --> 39:17.400]  Another person said hey fellow youths, doesn't this hip young go getter especially looks snazzy in her leather jacket?
[39:17.800 --> 39:23.800]  Another individual responded what precisely has this woman accomplished ever?
[39:23.800 --> 39:29.960]  And again fake news. They're trying to push
[39:30.680 --> 39:32.680]  chelsea clinton as this fresh
[39:33.400 --> 39:34.920]  young hip
[39:34.920 --> 39:36.920]  Face and it just isn't working
[39:36.920 --> 39:38.920]  We've talked about this over and over again
[39:38.920 --> 39:48.360]  When is the left going to have an actual moment of self reflection and realize that hillary clinton that the clinton royal family is done
[39:48.360 --> 39:53.080]  Yeah, people had their own versions of this it got memed pretty quickly
[39:53.720 --> 39:56.280]  But again, it's this entire idea of the left
[39:57.240 --> 40:02.600]  Forcing you what to think about an image where they have to say you must think this about this image isn't this cool
[40:02.760 --> 40:05.000]  This is really cool. Isn't it? How dare you say it's not cool?
[40:05.560 --> 40:12.520]  Well people are saying it's not cool. You're not gonna force a tired defunct legacy like that of the clintons
[40:12.520 --> 40:18.360]  Down the american people's throats again and again and again. It's done get over it move on
[40:19.480 --> 40:25.720]  And even buzzfeed admits it. I mean come on if buzzfeed is calling you out then you probably got it wrong
[40:27.160 --> 40:30.680]  Absolutely insane because we had the facebook killer yesterday
[40:31.480 --> 40:38.840]  Committed suicide it took them a couple of days to find him he escaped cleveland eventually committed suicide in eerie pennsylvania
[40:38.840 --> 40:45.720]  Again, this is out of information liberation mcdonald's employees helped catch facebook killer with deliberately slow service
[40:46.200 --> 40:48.200]  He was going through the drive-thru
[40:48.520 --> 40:50.520]  And a mcdonald's in eerie pennsylvania
[40:51.160 --> 40:56.760]  Got his chicken mcnuggets because that's important when you're planning, you know mass murder of people to get your chicken mcnuggets
[40:57.160 --> 41:02.920]  But they wouldn't give him his large fries. So the employees tried to delay him because they knew it was him. They called the police
[41:02.920 --> 41:08.760]  He drove off without his fries, but basically immediately turned the corner the police were on his tail
[41:09.800 --> 41:13.720]  And he committed suicide again absolutely chilling video
[41:13.720 --> 41:17.560]  We can only be thankful that he didn't follow through on his promise
[41:18.440 --> 41:24.520]  And kill more innocent people again. We don't know the motivations behind that. So that will continue to develop
[41:25.400 --> 41:27.400]  Now, of course, tereza may
[41:27.400 --> 41:30.920]  over in the uk yesterday announced that there would be a new general election
[41:30.920 --> 41:35.080]  in about 50 days time a snap election bearing in mind
[41:35.080 --> 41:38.840]  We only just had a general election in the uk in 2015
[41:39.720 --> 41:46.680]  Now people are concerned that this could mean sabotage for brexit. We have this headline out of bright bought
[41:47.240 --> 41:51.000]  britain's general election a ploy to stop hard brexit
[41:51.800 --> 41:55.800]  By raheem kasam who's in ukip and he knows of where he speaks
[41:55.800 --> 42:02.920]  What this means for the brexit process is concerning to some mrs. May was not on the leaf side in the referendum
[42:02.920 --> 42:04.920]  That's what people have to remember
[42:04.920 --> 42:09.240]  She's tried to say she's going to take the middle ground between nationalism and globalism
[42:09.640 --> 42:12.680]  You know, she said she supports sharia law in the past
[42:13.320 --> 42:15.320]  And she was pro remain
[42:16.040 --> 42:19.000]  Theresa may was pro remain she didn't campaign for it heavily
[42:19.000 --> 42:26.840]  But she was pro remain now we have concern that she will use this general election as basically a
[42:27.400 --> 42:28.840]  rubber stamp
[42:28.840 --> 42:34.840]  To follow through on brexit the way she wants it not the way the british people voted for it
[42:35.320 --> 42:40.840]  We want a hard brexit. That's what we voted for but she's going to use this according to raheem kasam
[42:40.840 --> 42:46.760]  The concern is to push a soft brexit because she can claim that she now owns the process
[42:46.760 --> 42:50.440]  Whereas before, you know, it was boris johnson. It was michael gove
[42:50.440 --> 42:57.480]  It was the people in the leaf campaign that tailored that entire campaign and they wanted a hard brexit now if tereza may
[42:57.960 --> 43:03.400]  Gets this mandate from the british people and she probably will win in a landslide. That's almost inevitable
[43:03.880 --> 43:09.560]  Because the opposition parties are so fundamentally broken and terrible and far left and socialist
[43:10.200 --> 43:12.200]  Then she could have
[43:12.200 --> 43:18.280]  She could have massed the political capital to say well, this is how we're going to do brexit. You voted me and to do it
[43:18.280 --> 43:21.400]  So i'm going to do it my way the problem with that is that
[43:21.960 --> 43:29.080]  She could follow through on a quote soft brexit and in fact, that's what eu sources and are saying according to this article
[43:29.960 --> 43:33.960]  Quote europe believes if she wins there will be a softer brexit
[43:34.840 --> 43:40.040]  Whether she will make that a soft or hard brexit. I don't know but she'll say i'm in charge and go her way
[43:40.040 --> 43:45.480]  That's the key. She will say she has the mandate to follow through on a soft brexit. What is a soft brexit?
[43:45.800 --> 43:47.080]  well, it's it's
[43:47.080 --> 43:56.760]  Allowing 300 000 people to emigrate to the uk every single year, which is the current situation 300 000 people net
[43:57.480 --> 44:05.000]  After the ones who have left have been accounted for come into the united kingdom every single year. It's a tiny island nation
[44:05.720 --> 44:07.720]  60 million population
[44:07.720 --> 44:15.720]  It's overflowing. It's absolutely overpopulated public services are collapsing. We have government health care, which is basically failing
[44:16.680 --> 44:18.120]  To get a doctor's appointment
[44:18.120 --> 44:25.720]  You have to basically be at death's door or pretend you're at death's door to enter the lottery to get an appointment for government health care
[44:26.200 --> 44:31.880]  And it's because we've taken in far too many low skilled immigrants and it's putting a huge strain on the system
[44:31.880 --> 44:40.600]  That is partly what people voted for the 52 percent with brexit. They want that 300 000 net immigration figure
[44:41.080 --> 44:43.080]  addressed and reduced
[44:44.120 --> 44:45.320]  That is a hard brexit
[44:45.320 --> 44:51.640]  But tereza may is now making noises that she won't follow through on that if she gets the political capital
[44:51.960 --> 44:56.280]  From this uk general election that's coming up in around 50 days time
[44:56.280 --> 45:01.880]  Meanwhile over in france. In fact, let's go to that video now because we we need to play this
[45:02.760 --> 45:07.080]  This is the truth about the french election. It happens on sunday the first round
[45:07.080 --> 45:12.680]  This is absolutely critical for the future of globalism versus nationalism in europe. Let's go to the clip
[45:13.560 --> 45:21.560]  The french election is absolutely chaotic with the polls showing no clear winner as the first round of voting approaches in the brexit spirit
[45:21.560 --> 45:27.480]  Marine Le Pen has framed the contest as the next epic struggle between globalism and nationalism
[45:28.120 --> 45:35.160]  39 percent of young people aged 18 to 24 support marine le pen almost doubled the number of her closest rival
[45:35.400 --> 45:43.080]  Emmanuel Macron 39 percent which proves what i've been saying all along populism is the new punk
[45:43.080 --> 45:51.400]  All the energy is behind le pen the french are sick and tired of their country being stuck in the malaise of anemic economic growth
[45:51.720 --> 45:56.360]  High taxes and high unemployment sick of being told to accept another
[45:57.000 --> 46:03.960]  ominous form of occupation this time under the guise of islamo fascism france has suffered 20
[46:04.600 --> 46:06.600]  Islamist attacks since charlie hebdo
[46:07.560 --> 46:11.000]  33 percent of muslim students support terrorism
[46:11.000 --> 46:17.160]  But don't you dare question whether it's normal for some classrooms in france to be 91 percent muslim
[46:17.480 --> 46:21.560]  Or you'll be fined le pen also has huge support amongst women
[46:21.880 --> 46:28.280]  Many of whom have observed the epidemic of sexual assault sweeping europe and don't feel safe
[46:28.440 --> 46:34.040]  So how is the establishment trying to stop this populist uprising by creating a fake
[46:34.040 --> 46:42.360]  Populist in the form of immanuel macron the french tony blare because nothing says populist like a former rothschild banker
[46:42.440 --> 46:45.880]  Who's never been elected to anything in his entire life?
[46:46.040 --> 46:54.520]  This guy's entire campaign was literally cooked up years ago by france war aland the outgoing socialist who's so unpopular
[46:54.760 --> 46:59.160]  He's not even bothering to run as a candidate macron is the aland minimi
[46:59.160 --> 47:05.560]  Aland has already anointed him as his successor and will campaign for him if he reaches round two
[47:05.640 --> 47:11.640]  Now all the corporate money and state media endorsements are flooding macron's way populist my ass
[47:11.960 --> 47:18.520]  His entire campaign was created in a lab by the very same establishment the french are trying to get rid of
[47:18.600 --> 47:23.000]  He also married his school teacher who is 25 years older than him
[47:23.000 --> 47:29.480]  And that's just weird how's macron gonna stop islamic terrorism by curbing islamic immigration
[47:29.960 --> 47:35.320]  No, by spying on french people's skype calls. No, thanks. So who else is there?
[47:35.400 --> 47:44.360]  Jean-Luc Mélenchon a far left communist sympathizer known as the french Hugo Chavez because venezuel is doing so well, isn't it?
[47:44.440 --> 47:50.680]  Yeah, the french are known for their oat cuisine and i don't think they fancy the idea of searching through the garbage for food
[47:50.680 --> 47:55.400]  I don't think they'd like the idea of flamingo being on the menu, but then again, they are french
[47:55.400 --> 48:03.080]  So don't quote me on that Mélenchon wants to reduce legal working hours from 35 hours a week to 32 hours a week
[48:03.240 --> 48:10.280]  Because a three-hour lunch break just isn't long enough because 24% youth unemployment just isn't high enough
[48:10.440 --> 48:15.080]  Let's create more incentives for businesses to leave friends great idea
[48:15.080 --> 48:22.280]  He starred in a video game in which he shakes down people on the street steals their money and puts it in a common pot
[48:22.440 --> 48:27.240]  Yeah, the world tried communism and it kind of didn't work out for us reference
[48:27.640 --> 48:33.400]  The entire 20th century or the french could default to fion the scandal ridden conservative
[48:33.560 --> 48:42.120]  Which would be like putting a bandaid over a gaping wound fion waffles on about islamic terrorism yet has no actual solutions to prevent it
[48:42.120 --> 48:45.160]  The time has clearly arrived full of pen
[49:12.520 --> 49:20.200]  Total de l'immigration de masse 61% of french people support halting islamic immigration all together
[49:20.440 --> 49:28.840]  Populism is still clearly in the ascendancy the anti immigration sweden democrats just became the most popular party in sweden
[49:29.240 --> 49:31.240]  Yes, sweden swim
[49:31.240 --> 49:36.200]  So as ever the establishment is up to its old tricks facebook just deleted
[49:36.200 --> 49:45.160]  30 000 of the most popular accounts in france a month after they vow to educate the french people and stop fake news
[49:45.240 --> 49:54.200]  And google is once again manipulating its algorithm in a bid to sway undecided voters can marine le pen be victorious
[49:54.520 --> 49:59.480]  Yes, but she has to win the first round. That's how she builds momentum
[49:59.480 --> 50:06.760]  Alond is now privately panicking and trying to get out of handing over power at the ceremony because he fears le pen
[50:07.000 --> 50:10.280]  Will win out of all the candidates le pen also has the most
[50:10.600 --> 50:18.280]  Solid support when it comes to people who will definitely vote for her the spirit of charles de gall has infused le pens campaign
[50:18.360 --> 50:24.360]  You also have a trump style phenomenon where people in the rural areas feel left behind and abandoned
[50:24.360 --> 50:32.520]  This isn't left versus right. This is brexit all over again. This is the people versus the establishment
[50:32.600 --> 50:37.960]  And that's why the establishment is terrified of president marine le pen
[50:37.960 --> 50:47.400]  Leave the republic, leave the boss. Huge election coming up sunday
[50:47.480 --> 50:53.000]  But we will be back in the next segment with more breaking news info wars dot com. Don't go away

[52:11.800 --> 52:18.120]  Knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride the bad member of the halogen family into the water
[52:18.120 --> 52:25.400]  They took the good halogen and put the deadly halogen in and when the Fukushima crisis worsened as it still is worsening today

[54:03.400 --> 54:05.400]  He's going for speed
[54:05.400 --> 54:07.400]  She's all alone

[54:19.000 --> 54:28.440]  We're live on the alex joneshow as we were hearing before the break absolutely huge election coming up in france round one is on sunday
[54:28.440 --> 54:35.480]  Marine Le Pen has to win round one. She could come second and go through to the second round, but that's not going to give her
[54:35.960 --> 54:41.160]  The momentum she needs to claim victory. Of course the entire establishment is saying
[54:41.800 --> 54:46.200]  She's got no chance people are going to rail against her in the second round when it counts. We heard
[54:47.000 --> 54:53.560]  Similar statements before brexit. We heard similar statements before the u.s. presidential election and look what happened
[54:53.560 --> 55:00.200]  Now Reuters is reporting on this very same subject. Le Pen's fn party calls eu flag
[55:00.760 --> 55:02.760]  oligarchic rag
[55:02.760 --> 55:09.480]  frances far-right national front stepped up its anti-european union rhetoric on wednesday days after toughening its stand against immigration
[55:09.800 --> 55:14.360]  In an apparent bid to mobilize its core supporters ahead of sunday's presidential election
[55:15.640 --> 55:20.520]  Opinion polls have for months predicted that marine le pen would attract enough votes to make it to the two-way runoff
[55:20.520 --> 55:25.480]  But again, she has to win the first round now her rhetoric has sharpened
[55:25.880 --> 55:30.760]  She said quote you'll see will soon stuff your oligarchic rag in the cupboard
[55:31.720 --> 55:36.520]  That's what her second-in-command flurry on philippo said of the eu flag in a message on twitter
[55:36.520 --> 55:43.160]  He was reacting to the european commission's representative office in france, which posted on twitter proud of our flag
[55:43.400 --> 55:47.800]  Symbol of unity solidarity and harmony between the peoples of europe. Let's not hide it
[55:47.800 --> 55:50.920]  Nobody gives a damn about that flag
[55:51.080 --> 55:56.760]  They've tried to create this phony false sense of patriotism behind the eu
[55:57.240 --> 55:59.960]  An unelected bureaucratic body
[56:00.520 --> 56:03.880]  That is completely unrepresentative of the people of the eu
[56:04.440 --> 56:10.280]  Nobody even knows who they are. They've done videos where they go out right outside the european parliament
[56:10.680 --> 56:15.480]  Right outside european institutions. Who's the president of the eu commission? Nobody knows
[56:15.480 --> 56:19.720]  Nobody knows who these people are yet. They tried to create a currency
[56:19.800 --> 56:25.960]  They tried to create a flag to rally people behind it because they know that patriotism resonates
[56:26.040 --> 56:32.040]  But you can't create it out of thin air. It's based on history. It's based on identity
[56:32.360 --> 56:34.360]  It's based on shared values
[56:34.920 --> 56:38.680]  The eu has absolutely none of that. They've tried to create this false
[56:39.320 --> 56:43.400]  Gestalt entity of phony patriotism. It never worked
[56:43.400 --> 56:50.200]  But now they're out saying we're proud of our flag. Marine Le Pen says she's going to stick that rag in the cupboard
[56:51.000 --> 56:53.240]  And she's got again as you saw in the video
[56:54.200 --> 56:58.840]  39 percent of young people in france are behind marine le pen double
[56:59.400 --> 57:05.400]  Those who are behind this fake populace that they created in a lab in the alize palace in
[57:05.400 --> 57:13.320]  Paris france immanuel macron. He's literally the brainchild of the outgoing incredibly unpopular socialist president
[57:13.800 --> 57:18.680]  Francois Hollande yet again, they tried to brand him as a populist
[57:18.920 --> 57:22.280]  He's a former Rothschild banker for crying out loud
[57:22.600 --> 57:28.440]  You're not going to brand someone like that as a populace. The french people are starting to figure it all out
[57:29.240 --> 57:32.840]  And now macron there on the left his poll numbers are going down
[57:32.840 --> 57:35.480]  The problem is this far-left communist
[57:35.880 --> 57:40.680]  Melenchon this french Hugo Chavez because venezuela has gone so well, hasn't it
[57:41.240 --> 57:46.120]  He's now rising to prominence. He's about equal with both le pen and macron in the polls
[57:46.600 --> 57:50.680]  So we'll see what happens in france. But again, she has to win the first round
[57:50.840 --> 57:52.840]  It's a two round contest first round
[57:53.320 --> 58:01.080]  23rd of april this sunday second round seventh of may if marine le pen wins people have said prominent people
[58:01.080 --> 58:09.080]  That the eu is completely finished that it's over because she will call for a frexit a french eu referendum
[58:09.480 --> 58:10.680]  They will
[58:10.680 --> 58:15.320]  Abandon the eu then it rests on only one pillar of germany and that its
[58:15.880 --> 58:17.880]  Eventual collapse is inevitable
[58:18.360 --> 58:25.080]  So huge high stakes riding on that french election this sunday and we'll be covering it here at info wars.com
[58:25.720 --> 58:27.480]  Stay tuned though. We got more breaking news

[58:49.400 --> 58:53.640]  Not a group you develop living defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so good?
[58:53.640 --> 58:59.080]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most
[58:59.160 --> 59:04.440]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system
[59:04.440 --> 59:07.240]  But right now we're dealing with massive
[59:07.960 --> 59:14.120]  Parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees
[59:14.840 --> 59:20.280]  Spreading disease around we have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites
[59:20.280 --> 59:24.040]  Tell us about all this episode. There's so many things that are in it. You have the neem in there
[59:24.120 --> 59:30.600]  You have the organic clove bud the organic wormwood. I recommend doing the parasite plans at least twice a year
[59:30.600 --> 59:33.560]  All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today
[59:33.640 --> 59:38.440]  It just came back in yesterday living defense info wars live.com and folks you can't lose full of stuff
[59:38.440 --> 59:40.440]  It's great for your body period and
[59:41.080 --> 59:47.080]  You support the broadcast info wars live.com. Thank you doctor group from the global healing center. Thank you so much for all your work
[59:47.080 --> 59:49.080]  Sir on this great product
[59:51.960 --> 59:54.600]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[59:54.600 --> 1:00:22.840]  We are on the march the empire is on the run alex jones and the gcm radio network
[1:00:24.600 --> 1:00:38.840]  We're live on the alex jones show. We're talking about france. We're talking about global issues here. We have another
[1:00:39.240 --> 1:00:46.200]  Terror attack foiled in france. Bear in mind france has had since january 2015 since charlie hebdo
[1:00:46.600 --> 1:00:51.000]  20 islamist terror attacks basically the equivalent of 20
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:58.680]  San Bernardinos to differing extent and extents in france. It's absolutely out of control now
[1:00:58.680 --> 1:01:05.800]  We have gateway pundit reporting islamist with bombs arrested in france planned presidential election attack
[1:01:06.440 --> 1:01:08.440]  french police were successful
[1:01:08.440 --> 1:01:14.120]  In stopping a radical islamic terrorist attack that was planned for the upcoming presidential election the two men were planning the attack
[1:01:14.120 --> 1:01:20.920]  They turned to radical islam in a shared prison once again. This is the radicalization process
[1:01:20.920 --> 1:01:24.840]  It always takes place in prisons because they stick them together
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:32.360]  They segregate into gangs and anyone who doesn't show obedience to the islamic gang is targeted
[1:01:32.360 --> 1:01:35.160]  So then they become brainwashed they become indoctrinated
[1:01:35.720 --> 1:01:40.360]  The article goes on to say an islamic state flag was found in the apartment where the two men were arrested
[1:01:40.360 --> 1:01:43.080]  Anti-terror police made the arrest
[1:01:43.800 --> 1:01:48.680]  It was set to be some kind of presidential election attack. They foiled it
[1:01:49.160 --> 1:01:52.840]  They're probably are more attacks in the in the works right now
[1:01:53.240 --> 1:02:00.040]  Because again, this is what happens when you invite this culture into your country france is seven percent muslim
[1:02:00.520 --> 1:02:07.160]  This is a huge problem now. It's not just a problem in terms of the existential threat in terms of violent terror attacks
[1:02:07.160 --> 1:02:11.480]  It's the march through the institutions as the socialists used to call it
[1:02:12.120 --> 1:02:18.280]  The more a country becomes muslim islamism is a political system. It's not just a set of beliefs
[1:02:18.920 --> 1:02:20.920]  They want to take political power
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:26.360]  They want to impose sharia law and they're doing it to a certain extent in many of these european countries
[1:02:26.760 --> 1:02:28.760]  And that's the real threat
[1:02:28.760 --> 1:02:33.400]  That's what changes the makeup of an entire society. It's not necessarily
[1:02:34.120 --> 1:02:36.120]  although it's tragic, you know
[1:02:36.120 --> 1:02:39.640]  Eight people getting moaned down on a bridge in west minster, london
[1:02:40.200 --> 1:02:45.800]  That's a one-off event and it's tragic and it's horrible, but it's about the march through through the institutions
[1:02:45.880 --> 1:02:47.880]  It's it's about what they call dowar
[1:02:48.200 --> 1:02:55.480]  In islamic faith. It's a political belief system. It's not just a religious belief system. They want to advance sharia law
[1:02:55.720 --> 1:02:58.120]  They want to advance these incredibly
[1:02:58.120 --> 1:03:05.480]  Misogynistic anti-women belief systems which subjugate them and make them, you know, they're treated a little better than cattle
[1:03:05.880 --> 1:03:09.480]  We saw the video out of saudi arabia. I think it was a q8 a few weeks ago
[1:03:10.040 --> 1:03:15.240]  Where the the slave maid is hanging from the window what they said was a suicide attempt
[1:03:15.880 --> 1:03:21.560]  And the woman's just filming it out of the window. They bring in slaves from africa to do this kind of work again
[1:03:21.560 --> 1:03:27.400]  No rules for employment whatsoever. They're they're beholden to their masters
[1:03:28.120 --> 1:03:32.040]  There you see the article we had a few weeks ago because of visa issues
[1:03:32.040 --> 1:03:35.880]  So they treat them like absolute dirt and that's part of their culture
[1:03:36.760 --> 1:03:40.600]  And we don't we shouldn't want to import that culture into the west
[1:03:41.480 --> 1:03:48.520]  Absolutely horrific stuff. Thankfully she survived with just a broken leg. I think it was but that is how slaves
[1:03:48.520 --> 1:03:56.360]  They still have slaves in the islamic world. That is how they're treated in countries like q8. You had another video out of saudi arabia
[1:03:57.240 --> 1:03:59.160]  Which shows the guardian
[1:03:59.160 --> 1:04:01.560]  Of the girls in the school teenage girls
[1:04:02.040 --> 1:04:08.760]  Who are only able to exit the building if they're appointed drivers and male escorts are there to pick them up if they're not
[1:04:09.160 --> 1:04:14.680]  You saw the video they emerge out of the classroom and they're whipped on the head with a stick to get back in
[1:04:14.680 --> 1:04:20.040]  This is a sharia law. This is how women are treated in islamic countries
[1:04:20.040 --> 1:04:25.160]  And they want to codify that through the march through the institutions to impose sharia law
[1:04:25.160 --> 1:04:30.840]  So it's not just about terror attacks. That's just a side effect. It's about
[1:04:32.120 --> 1:04:38.040]  Society being overturned by these belief systems which are intolerant and completely contradictory
[1:04:38.040 --> 1:04:43.960]  To western ideals of freedom and real true equality for all
[1:04:44.520 --> 1:04:52.200]  We'll be back in the next segment roger stone is coming up breaking news at info wars calm stay right there. We'll be back
[1:04:59.480 --> 1:05:05.880]  According to the mainstream media president donald trump was mean to kids on east or sunday
[1:05:05.880 --> 1:05:10.040]  That's right dozens of news outlets ran with a misleading video
[1:05:10.440 --> 1:05:16.840]  claiming that president trump signed a kids make america great again hat and then threw it away from the kid
[1:05:17.160 --> 1:05:24.600]  Into the crowd the video quickly went viral racking up nearly 10 000 retweets and getting picked up by other news outlets
[1:05:24.840 --> 1:05:30.840]  The washington post reported trump using a thick sharpie put his signature on the bill of the cap
[1:05:30.840 --> 1:05:37.000]  Then looked up and lobbed it into the crowd nowhere near the hand that had given it to him
[1:05:37.320 --> 1:05:40.440]  And buzzfeed even claimed that the poor kid never got his hat back
[1:05:40.680 --> 1:05:43.720]  But in reality other camera angles clearly show
[1:05:44.200 --> 1:05:51.800]  The president and the kid were just having fun and the boy indeed caught his hat signed by the president of the united states
[1:05:52.200 --> 1:05:56.440]  You can see the videos for yourself right now at info wars calm

[1:08:25.400 --> 1:08:33.400]  We are live it's the second hour of the alex jones show and we have roger stone the one and only live in studio good to meet you roger now
[1:08:33.400 --> 1:08:39.400]  Get into first what you just mentioned there bill o'reilly looks like he's hanging by a thread at this point
[1:08:39.400 --> 1:08:47.400]  People have predicted his demise for a while now he's been sailing at the top of fox news you know 4 million viewers every single night basically
[1:08:47.400 --> 1:08:56.400]  We've had this recent controversy but it's not what it seems there's been this campaign behind the scenes and now it's spilled over publicly
[1:08:56.400 --> 1:09:06.400]  Media Matters this is a group that constantly attacks us on a daily basis they have people literally listening to the show every minute transcribing everything
[1:09:06.400 --> 1:09:13.400]  We know the origin of media matters it's an obama front group they used to meet with the obama administration on a weekly basis
[1:09:13.400 --> 1:09:20.400]  They bragged about how they would write the editorial slant for MSNBC and all these big nightly news shows
[1:09:20.400 --> 1:09:30.400]  This is not a media organization this is a political operative group and now they're basically celebrating the fact that they've brought down O'Reilly
[1:09:30.400 --> 1:09:35.400]  As it looks like he's set to be at least let go by Fox News what's your take on this
[1:09:35.400 --> 1:09:48.400]  Well I think that's very accurate media matters of course is a group of Clinton needs to apologists they apologize for anything they'll do anything necessary to cover up the various crimes of the Clintons
[1:09:48.400 --> 1:10:01.400]  It is run by a misfit named David Brock who in the day was actually a conservative operative friend of mine until he figured out he couldn't make any money on the right so he shifted to the left to total mercenary
[1:10:01.400 --> 1:10:11.400]  It is reported recently that he suffered heart attack and he has not been seen or heard from recently I have my own suspicions about his health problems but I don't think they're heart attack related
[1:10:11.400 --> 1:10:22.400]  In any event they are crowing I think a little prematurely as you know Bill O'Reilly has been a cash cow for Fox I mean he is their leading ratings generator
[1:10:22.400 --> 1:10:32.400]  I'm not particularly an O'Reilly fan on a personal basis his book on the Kennedy assassination is completely and totally wrong it's the conventional wisdom
[1:10:32.400 --> 1:10:36.400]  By the way Lee Harvey Oswald did it and he acted alone that's what O'Reilly thinks
[1:10:36.400 --> 1:10:41.400]  O'Reilly start off as like a muckraker regarding the JFK's decision
[1:10:41.400 --> 1:10:59.400]  He did and there's some discrepancies in his own description because he claims that he was in Palm Beach when the House select committee on assassinations was seeking to subpoena a key witness in the 70s and that witness committed suicide
[1:10:59.400 --> 1:11:05.400]  O'Reilly said he was on the doorstep of the Palm Beach home where this witness killed himself
[1:11:05.400 --> 1:11:13.400]  But unfortunately proof shows that he was on the air in Dallas at that time and no one even may can be in two places at once
[1:11:13.400 --> 1:11:21.400]  In any event I do think that there is an orchestrated campaign of smear against O'Reilly
[1:11:21.400 --> 1:11:31.400]  We saw this in the case of Roger Ailes as well and it's very clear to anyone who watches Fox that they are missing the leadership of Roger Ailes
[1:11:31.400 --> 1:11:37.400]  Is the man who formulated Fox into a powerhouse, the powerhouse on the right
[1:11:37.400 --> 1:11:44.400]  And has made Fox extremely profitable for Rupert Murdoch and his family
[1:11:44.400 --> 1:11:54.400]  This same kind of campaign of half truth and smear was utilized at Ailes who picked up and left
[1:11:54.400 --> 1:11:58.400]  And I think he got $30 million on his way out the door
[1:11:58.400 --> 1:12:01.400]  So this is the high pressure tactics
[1:12:01.400 --> 1:12:04.400]  Now some of you may remember Media Matters for America
[1:12:04.400 --> 1:12:11.400]  Crow about the fact that they had me banned at CNN, they had me banned at MSNBC
[1:12:11.400 --> 1:12:19.400]  Little Known was the fact that I broke the MSNBC ban last week when I was on Meet the Press with Chuck Todd, Meet the Press Daily
[1:12:19.400 --> 1:12:24.400]  A performance that I'm quite proud of, I thought he was entirely fair and professional
[1:12:24.400 --> 1:12:32.400]  But obviously the boycott at MSNBC as orchestrated by Media Matters was broken
[1:12:32.400 --> 1:12:36.400]  They don't seem to be crowing about that any place, but I just did
[1:12:36.400 --> 1:12:41.400]  In any event, I'm hopeful that they will not get O'Reilly
[1:12:41.400 --> 1:12:47.400]  It's interesting to me if you see the demonstrators outside of Fox, they have all these pre-printed signs
[1:12:47.400 --> 1:12:50.400]  Doesn't seem very grassroots to me, Paul, not at all
[1:12:50.400 --> 1:12:56.400]  The thing that comes up for me again and again is the left uses the fact that the right has principles
[1:12:56.400 --> 1:12:59.400]  They use that against us because they don't have any
[1:12:59.400 --> 1:13:05.400]  So it's always about the personal attack, isn't it? You very rarely see people on the right going after people on the left
[1:13:05.400 --> 1:13:08.400]  In terms of personal attacks, you've seen it more recently
[1:13:08.400 --> 1:13:14.400]  Chuck Johnson, Cernovich have said we should just use their tactics, go after people's personal lives
[1:13:14.400 --> 1:13:21.400]  Expose their sexual scandals, but it's not really been a tactic of the right over the past 10, 15, 20 years
[1:13:21.400 --> 1:13:26.400]  But the left always resorts that personal, snipey attack, don't they?
[1:13:26.400 --> 1:13:30.400]  Because again, they can't compete on a level playing field with just the political argument
[1:13:30.400 --> 1:13:34.400]  Yeah, I reject those. I don't want to attack anybody personally
[1:13:34.400 --> 1:13:39.400]  With the possible exception of Anna Navarro because she is so epically abusive to everyone she meets
[1:13:39.400 --> 1:13:44.400]  Waiters, doorman, gaffers, hairstylists, makeup people
[1:13:44.400 --> 1:13:49.400]  She's a diva and I don't like abusive people, but putting her aside, I agree with you
[1:13:49.400 --> 1:13:54.400]  I'm not interested in the sexual foibles of the leaders of the left, I could care less
[1:13:54.400 --> 1:13:58.400]  It's a free country, I'm a libertarian as well as a libertine
[1:13:58.400 --> 1:14:03.400]  And what happens in people's bedrooms is their own business, I don't think I ought to be in the political realm
[1:14:03.400 --> 1:14:11.400]  That said, however, what really bothers me about the left today is that their answer for everything is censorship
[1:14:11.400 --> 1:14:15.400]  In other words, they can't argue on the basis of ideas
[1:14:15.400 --> 1:14:20.400]  They can't argue on the basis of issues, so they have to silence us
[1:14:20.400 --> 1:14:27.400]  They're trying to do so through Facebook, through Google, through these kinds of campaigns being run against O'Reilly
[1:14:27.400 --> 1:14:31.400]  Censorship to me seems to be fundamentally un-American
[1:14:31.400 --> 1:14:38.400]  We allow everybody a voice, this is a flagrant egregious violation of the First Amendment
[1:14:38.400 --> 1:14:43.400]  And it's interesting to me that the left has come so far
[1:14:43.400 --> 1:14:47.400]  It used to be that they were the ones arguing for civil liberties
[1:14:47.400 --> 1:14:50.400]  They were the ones arguing for the First Amendment
[1:14:50.400 --> 1:14:55.400]  And now their answer is to silence us, to ban us
[1:14:55.400 --> 1:14:59.400]  Banning anybody is a bad idea, in my opinion
[1:14:59.400 --> 1:15:05.400]  They are the new puritans, talking about the left and the crazy stuff that they get away with
[1:15:05.400 --> 1:15:10.400]  I don't know if you've seen this, but there's an MSNBC guest, if you can flash that article back up on screen
[1:15:10.400 --> 1:15:15.400]  Called in a tweet, for ISIS to bomb a Trump building
[1:15:15.400 --> 1:15:18.400]  So Trump, there is right there, he's called in a tweet
[1:15:18.400 --> 1:15:24.400]  This is a counter-terrorism analyst on MSNBC, Malcolm Nance
[1:15:24.400 --> 1:15:26.400]  So there's a Trump Tower in Istanbul
[1:15:26.400 --> 1:15:31.400]  This is my nominee for first ISIS suicide bombing of a Trump property
[1:15:31.400 --> 1:15:35.400]  This is a guy who's acted as an apologist for an Islamist terrorist
[1:15:35.400 --> 1:15:39.400]  After every single major attack, he downplayed the Nice attack
[1:15:39.400 --> 1:15:46.400]  Where the guy plowed a truck through 80 odd people as just grievance against a twisted society or whatever
[1:15:46.400 --> 1:15:51.400]  He's openly calling for ISIS to suicide bomb a Trump property
[1:15:51.400 --> 1:15:56.400]  Bearing in mind that probably 10,000 people, innocent people who are going to work and doing their job
[1:15:56.400 --> 1:15:59.400]  Are in this building and he's calling for that
[1:15:59.400 --> 1:16:06.400]  Absolutely insane, New York Times a few days ago called for Trump to just leave ISIS alone in Syria
[1:16:06.400 --> 1:16:14.400]  What is it with the far left increasingly moving towards this kind of hysterical pro-Islamist rhetoric?
[1:16:14.400 --> 1:16:18.400]  And where's media matters for America? Why aren't they calling for this fellow to be suspended?
[1:16:18.400 --> 1:16:21.400]  Why is he still on the payroll at MSNBC?
[1:16:21.400 --> 1:16:25.400]  The left is completely hypocritical
[1:16:25.400 --> 1:16:29.400]  You're absolutely right, they monitor this program
[1:16:29.400 --> 1:16:32.400]  They monitor media matters of America
[1:16:32.400 --> 1:16:38.400]  Every rural radio broadcast that they may do
[1:16:38.400 --> 1:16:44.400]  I know exactly who's opening my press releases and how many times, by the way, we know where you live too
[1:16:44.400 --> 1:16:49.400]  And it's creepy in a way
[1:16:49.400 --> 1:16:55.400]  It's heavy-handed, it's nasty, it's personal
[1:16:55.400 --> 1:16:59.400]  But those are the tactics that they choose to employ
[1:16:59.400 --> 1:17:04.400]  Yet they turn around and they accuse us of being the abuser
[1:17:04.400 --> 1:17:13.400]  In other words, in this entire past election year, what interests me is how consistently the left would specifically accuse us of doing
[1:17:13.400 --> 1:17:17.400]  Precisely those things that they are doing
[1:17:17.400 --> 1:17:23.400]  Whether it is John Podesta saying, well, Trump and his associates are in bed with the Russians
[1:17:23.400 --> 1:17:31.400]  No, John, it's you and your brother Tony and the Clintons who are in bed with the oligarchs close to Vladimir Putin
[1:17:31.400 --> 1:17:36.400]  It's you and your brother Tony who are literally making millions out of your association with Vladimir Putin
[1:17:36.400 --> 1:17:45.400]  Very clever because you see it sends the mainstream media on a wild goose chase, examining whether Trump and his associates have any ties with Russia
[1:17:45.400 --> 1:17:52.400]  We don't, while ignoring the very real financial ties of Hillary's crowd with the Kremlin
[1:17:52.400 --> 1:18:02.400]  It is creepy, it's kind of stalk-alike behavior where they try to find out any little tiny detail about your private life and then mine it for information
[1:18:02.400 --> 1:18:09.400]  Like, you know, I've got a friend who, they were trying to get information about him to try and get to me because I refused to do interviews with a lot of these people
[1:18:09.400 --> 1:18:17.400]  And they were going through his Facebook page, you know, five years before in 2012 when this, basically a kid, he was 18 years old
[1:18:17.400 --> 1:18:21.400]  Posting pictures of himself drunk when he was 18 on Facebook
[1:18:21.400 --> 1:18:26.400]  They were asking him questions about that, they were asking him questions about his parents
[1:18:26.400 --> 1:18:38.400]  It was Vice Magazine, it's this like weird creepy stalker-ish behavior that they engage in to try to sink people's personality to try and demonize something they did five years ago
[1:18:38.400 --> 1:18:41.400]  It doesn't even relate to anything they're doing now
[1:18:41.400 --> 1:18:50.400]  Yeah, I had a perfect example, this was a brilliant young writer and researcher for Donald Trump named Sam Nunberg
[1:18:50.400 --> 1:19:01.400]  Nunberg had some intemperate posts on his Facebook page five years ago long before he came into the employ of Trump that related to the Reverend Al Sharpton
[1:19:01.400 --> 1:19:09.400]  And unfortunately, Media Matters for America dug this stuff up, fed it to a number of reporters
[1:19:09.400 --> 1:19:15.400]  It was ultimately written, this caused Nunberg to lose his job in the Trump entourage
[1:19:15.400 --> 1:19:20.400]  I'm proud to say that I was ultimately able to get Nunberg and Reverend Sharpton together
[1:19:20.400 --> 1:19:27.400]  Sharpton is a Christian and he is a forgiving man and the appropriate apologies were rendered
[1:19:27.400 --> 1:19:34.400]  And it's now a past matter, but it's a perfect example of how the left takes out somebody who's extremely effective
[1:19:34.400 --> 1:19:40.400]  Sam Nunberg is one of the most effective researcher, writer, operatives that I know
[1:19:40.400 --> 1:19:47.400]  OK, we'll be back with Roger Stone in the next segment, going to talk about Chelsea Clinton and how they're trying to rebrand her
[1:19:47.400 --> 1:19:53.400]  yet again to shove the Clinton legacy, the Clinton royal family down the throats of Americans

Their names were Jeff and Andy. Time went by, they developed facial hair, and one day, something happened. Andy got ripped off by overpriced razors. So they decided to start their own shaving company and fix shaving once and for all.
[1:22:20.400 --> 1:22:33.400]  While they were the best designers, they bought a 95-year-old German blade factory and they started selling high-quality razors online with no upcharging direct to customers. How did the overpriced razor company respond? By threatening to sue their pants off.
[1:22:33.400 --> 1:22:39.400]  Don't worry, Jeff and Andy have plenty of pants and a relentless dream to get all guys a great shave at a great price.

[1:23:07.400 --> 1:23:17.400]  That was all until Andro 400. I started out four months ago and since taking Andro 400, I have dropped 45 pounds. I'm sleeping better. There's no cravings. I actually don't even think about food.
[1:23:17.400 --> 1:23:25.400]  My knee pain went away. I've had some lower back issues and I've noticed that that went away and I can only contribute that to Andro 400.
[1:23:25.400 --> 1:23:30.400]  One thing that Andro 400 said on the radio ad, does it attack belly fat? Well, let me tell you did.
[1:23:30.400 --> 1:23:38.400]  The second month is where I saw a drastic change in the size of my stomach. I've lost six inches. This product really does work.

[1:24:25.400 --> 1:24:31.400]  We are back live on the Alex Jones show with Roger Stone. Before we get back to Roger, I just want to tell you about Survival Shield X2.

[1:26:14.400 --> 1:26:20.400]  Variety magazine had Chelsea Clinton on the cover again and the tweet that accompanied the images.
[1:26:20.400 --> 1:26:29.400]  Isn't she cool? Look at Chelsea Clinton. She's so hip and cool. People didn't buy it. Even Buzzfeed had to admit that people are just sick to the back teeth of the Clinton's full stop.
[1:26:29.400 --> 1:26:30.400]  What's your take?
[1:26:30.400 --> 1:26:38.400]  Well, the real fundamental problem is that Chelsea Clinton is dumb as a brick and endlessly abusive according to the New York Post.
[1:26:38.400 --> 1:26:46.400]  Evidently, the Clinton Foundation has had problems keeping employees because she is such an abusive diva.
[1:26:46.400 --> 1:26:56.400]  Now, the plan for her is to move her to a suburban Westchester, New York County district and have her run for Congress.
[1:26:56.400 --> 1:27:07.400]  If that happens, I'm highly confident that Danny Williams, the abandoned son of Bill Clinton, intends to move to that same district, which is 40% African American,
[1:27:07.400 --> 1:27:21.400]  and will be throwing his ring in the hat for Congress in the Democratic primary opposing Chelsea Clinton. It would be a great forum for discussion of how the Clintons have abandoned this African American boy who is Bill's son
[1:27:21.400 --> 1:27:35.400]  and how Chelsea intends to, I guess, inherit that rough to $400 to $500 million that her parents have essentially stolen since leaving the presidency.
[1:27:35.400 --> 1:27:41.400]  This is a contest. Danny Williams versus Chelsea Clinton that we can look forward to.
[1:27:41.400 --> 1:27:48.400]  And what has she achieved, apart from being a consultant for the Clinton Foundation? She hasn't actually achieved anything besides that.
[1:27:48.400 --> 1:28:02.400]  Well, she was paid $600,000 for NBC when the parent company, which owned NBC at the time, General Electric, had a defense contract on Hillary Clinton's desk for approval, a multi-million-dollar contract.
[1:28:02.400 --> 1:28:10.400]  So she herself has been, you know, involved as a facilitator of some of these massive bribes.
[1:28:10.400 --> 1:28:19.400]  John Ossoff in Georgia, the District 6 Special Election, unsuccessful. The question people are asking, are Democrats ever going to win again?
[1:28:19.400 --> 1:28:33.400]  Yeah, this was their opportunity. The Kansas District was very close. It's really a shame because, in retrospect, I now realize that Mike Pompeo should never have left Congress.
[1:28:33.400 --> 1:28:44.400]  He should have stayed there. I don't think he's up to the job of CIA director. He almost demonstrated that definitively last week when he said that WikiLeaks is a Russian asset.
[1:28:44.400 --> 1:28:52.400]  Well, Mr. Director, it isn't, and there's no evidence. And your friends there at the CIA can produce no evidence to that effect.
[1:28:52.400 --> 1:29:00.400]  But the Republicans even woke up to the Georgia District late, and they still managed to pull it out.
[1:29:00.400 --> 1:29:07.400]  I think the two great opportunities for the Democrats have been blown here. Here, they think they have Donald Trump on the ropes.
[1:29:07.400 --> 1:29:16.400]  They're certainly taking a beating in the mainstream media, although I would argue, completely holding his own, and the Democrats still can't pull off a victory.
[1:29:16.400 --> 1:29:20.400]  You've got an event coming up tonight, San Antonio. We've got 30 seconds. Just tell us about that.
[1:29:20.400 --> 1:29:38.400]  Actually, it's tomorrow night. I am tomorrow night in San Antonio, Texas, from 5.30 to 9, at the Arteza at Quarry Village, which is 300 East Bass Roads, 11.43 in San Antonio, organized by Republicans in Bear County.
[1:29:38.400 --> 1:29:43.400]  We're going to have some speaking. We're going to have some Q&A. We're going to be signing some books.
[1:29:43.400 --> 1:29:50.400]  Please come by. Everybody turn up for that event. We will be back live in the next segment.
[1:30:14.400 --> 1:30:24.400]  And then threw it away from the kid into the crowd. The video quickly went viral, racking up nearly 10,000 retweets and getting picked up by other news outlets.
[1:30:24.400 --> 1:30:37.400]  The Washington Post reported Trump, using a thick, sharpie, put his signature on the bill of the cap, then looked up and lobbed it into the crowd, nowhere near the hand that had given it to him.
[1:30:37.400 --> 1:30:46.400]  BuzzFeed even claimed that the poor kid never got his hat back. But in reality, other camera angles clearly show the president and the kid were just having fun.
[1:30:46.400 --> 1:31:08.400]  And the boy indeed caught his hat, signed by the president of the United States. You can see the videos for yourself right now at Infowars.com.

[1:31:58.400 --> 1:32:06.400]  Infowars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfowarsStore.com.
[1:32:06.400 --> 1:32:13.400]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[1:32:13.400 --> 1:32:21.400]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor,
[1:32:21.400 --> 1:32:27.400]  using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene.
[1:32:27.400 --> 1:32:30.400]  Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[1:32:30.400 --> 1:32:37.400]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor. It works.
[1:32:37.400 --> 1:32:46.400]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest-level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.
[1:32:46.400 --> 1:32:55.400]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfowarsStore.com, so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Infowar against the Globalist all at the same time.
[1:32:55.400 --> 1:33:00.400]  A total 360 win!
[1:33:25.400 --> 1:33:39.400]  We're live on The Alex Jones Show in the second hour, and I'm delighted to be joined by Andrew Torber, the founder of GAB.ai.
[1:33:39.400 --> 1:33:44.400]  Many people have been calling for an alternative network, an alternative social media platform.
[1:33:44.400 --> 1:33:52.400]  Well, Andrew stepped up and did it, and now he's facing intense scrutiny and backlash from that very same establishment.
[1:33:52.400 --> 1:33:55.400]  Andrew, welcome to the show.
[1:33:55.400 --> 1:33:59.400]  Great to be here. I hear you're now Paul the Great, according to Mike.
[1:33:59.400 --> 1:34:05.400]  According to Cernovich, he's trying to build me up to embrace my own greatness.
[1:34:05.400 --> 1:34:07.400]  Mindset.
[1:34:07.400 --> 1:34:13.400]  Let's go from the beginning, though, for people who don't know what GAB is, what inspired you to develop it in the first place?
[1:34:13.400 --> 1:34:19.400]  Sure. I originally started an ad tech company, an advertising technology company called Automate Ads.
[1:34:19.400 --> 1:34:26.400]  Working directly with Facebook, Twitter, and Google on top of their ad platforms, I was living and working in Silicon Valley,
[1:34:26.400 --> 1:34:31.400]  and I have some Patriot friends inside of each of those companies.
[1:34:31.400 --> 1:34:35.400]  They gave me some heads up about some of the stuff that was going to start happening,
[1:34:35.400 --> 1:34:40.400]  some of the agendas that were going to start happening, and then I started to see it for myself.
[1:34:40.400 --> 1:34:47.400]  What really pushed me over the edge was when a whistleblower on Facebook's trending topics team came forward last May
[1:34:47.400 --> 1:34:52.400]  and said, yeah, we're actively suppressing and censoring conservative news, conservative sources.
[1:34:52.400 --> 1:34:54.400]  And that broke into a huge scandal, right?
[1:34:54.400 --> 1:34:58.400]  That was a huge story, yeah. And Facebook flew out, climbed back, and that made it all better.
[1:34:58.400 --> 1:35:04.400]  They had to apologize, didn't they, and promise not to do it again, unlike Twitter, which will never do that.
[1:35:04.400 --> 1:35:09.400]  Right. I mean, it was really just incredible because when you look at the Facebook trending topics product,
[1:35:09.400 --> 1:35:16.400]  it's used by over a billion people every single month, and a majority of those people see that as what is news and what isn't.
[1:35:16.400 --> 1:35:25.400]  So you have this product that has this monopoly on communication and information pushing a certain agenda and blocking out other ideas.
[1:35:25.400 --> 1:35:31.400]  That's scary. And I think conservatives, a lot of time, they like to complain about things, but they never take action.
[1:35:31.400 --> 1:35:35.400]  So I said, I'm going to take action. So that's when I started Gab.
[1:35:35.400 --> 1:35:42.400]  I mean, we've heard it many times before. We complain about censorship constantly, whether it be Facebook, YouTube, or Twitter.
[1:35:42.400 --> 1:35:49.400]  And the comment is always, why not just start your own network? Well, the problem with that is you can't just start a million new networks
[1:35:49.400 --> 1:35:57.400]  and have zero people on them because it would be completely pointless. But you tried to, from the outset, attract people to this new network
[1:35:57.400 --> 1:36:02.400]  so it would be a centralized focus where controversial speeches is welcomed.
[1:36:02.400 --> 1:36:11.400]  So how did you get past that roadblock of having a big enough user base for this to have an effect and to appeal to prominent people to join?
[1:36:11.400 --> 1:36:18.400]  Sure. So I think originally what we had thought was like, okay, there's definitely a market opportunity here for an alternative
[1:36:18.400 --> 1:36:26.400]  because what we see happening now is fragmentation of the social space. People are by nature tribal.
[1:36:26.400 --> 1:36:33.400]  And to assume that you can have billions of us all in one spot and we're all going to get along and play nice and play by one set of rules
[1:36:33.400 --> 1:36:42.400]  I think is the wrong way to think. And I think what we saw as an opportunity is, hey, listen, right now conservatives, people on the right,
[1:36:42.400 --> 1:36:47.400]  Trump supporters specifically, are being shut up, are being censored, are being told to go away, are being suspended,
[1:36:47.400 --> 1:36:51.400]  are being told their ideas are not of any value. So that right there is our first market.
[1:36:51.400 --> 1:36:56.400]  But I think who's next? Is it going to be people in the center? Is it going to be people on the left?
[1:36:56.400 --> 1:37:02.400]  Who is next in terms of who they're going to target and what type of ideas they're going to attack?
[1:37:02.400 --> 1:37:08.400]  So to start, we had this waiting list. And the reason that we had to have this waiting list is because there was so much more demand
[1:37:08.400 --> 1:37:15.400]  than we even anticipated early on. And it was just bogging down our servers from day one. So we said, okay, we have to have a wait list.
[1:37:15.400 --> 1:37:23.400]  And that was kind of how we thralled it and also built this exclusivity marketing and this idea of, well, this is cool and new
[1:37:23.400 --> 1:37:28.400]  and I want to try it out. And we've spent zero dollars on marketing. It's all been word of mouth. It's all been organic.
[1:37:28.400 --> 1:37:35.400]  And the waiting list is still huge, right? Yeah, we still have 250,000 people on the wait list. We have 160,000 users.
[1:37:35.400 --> 1:37:41.400]  We just turned eight months old three or four days ago. So we're doing very well.
[1:37:41.400 --> 1:37:45.400]  So the app was developed months ago is ready. Tell us what happened with Apple.
[1:37:45.400 --> 1:37:54.400]  Yeah, so we have had an iOS app ready since December. We've submitted to Apple, I believe nine times now and they've rejected it every time.
[1:37:54.400 --> 1:38:01.400]  And they reject it on the basis of objectionable content. And this is a very subjective term.
[1:38:01.400 --> 1:38:11.400]  So what they would do is purposely seek out objectionable content, searching for bad words or all the words that we know as to be, I guess, objectionable.
[1:38:11.400 --> 1:38:19.400]  Seek out those users, take a screenshot and then reject us. And they would demand that we ban those users and we remove any content that is objectionable from the app.
[1:38:19.400 --> 1:38:26.400]  I doubt they did that with Twitter in which there is the most virulent racism on a second-by-second basis, right?
[1:38:26.400 --> 1:38:39.400]  Right, absolutely. So what we did, we came up with this plan where we removed the ability to search in the app and we removed the ability essentially to discover content in the app unless you were actually following other users.
[1:38:39.400 --> 1:38:45.400]  We started Apple out with a fresh account, not following anybody. You can't search. You can't go out and find this type of content in the app itself.
[1:38:45.400 --> 1:38:53.400]  So what they did is they logged into our web app, went and searched, found those users, followed them on the test account, went back into the app and then screenshotted it.
[1:38:53.400 --> 1:38:59.400]  So they're holding not only our iOS app accountable to their guidelines but also our web app now and using that as a circumvent.
[1:38:59.400 --> 1:39:02.400]  Those rules wouldn't be applied to anyone else normally, correct?
[1:39:02.400 --> 1:39:12.400]  No, they're not. I mean, you can go on Twitter in the iOS app, you can go on Reddit in the iOS app, you can search any objectionable term that you can think of and you're going to find something.
[1:39:12.400 --> 1:39:15.400]  That's the point when you're looking for it, you're going to find it.
[1:39:15.400 --> 1:39:25.400]  So it's perfectly acceptable for people to tweet, kill all white people or assassinate Donald Trump on Twitter, which happens literally every minute of every day basically if you want to search for it.
[1:39:25.400 --> 1:39:33.400]  They have absolutely no problem whatsoever but because you're coming at it from the angle of this is the free speech platform, they've got a problem with it.
[1:39:33.400 --> 1:39:44.400]  We saw Brightbot, they had an app that got banned by Apple. I mean, what's the solution? You got bashed in the media by the way for hiding the true nature of it but you were just following Apple stores rules, right?
[1:39:44.400 --> 1:39:53.400]  Yeah, no, we were absolutely not hiding anything, we were being completely upfront. We developed an app to work a certain way and all we did is removed our search bar.
[1:39:53.400 --> 1:40:10.400]  It's not like we changed the app in any dramatic way, we just removed the ability for them to actually seek out this content and the point is that they still found a way, a workaround by logging into our web version to then follow and find those people and reject us on that same basis of objectionable content.
[1:40:10.400 --> 1:40:23.400]  There's Mark Cuban calling for that objectionable content to be removed from Twitter, which is actually a good point. One of the criticisms of Gab and these other new social media networks is that they are echo chambers.
[1:40:23.400 --> 1:40:36.400]  I mean, Twitter is a huge echo chamber for leftists. Up until what, just before the campaign really got started last year, there were very few prominent conservatives who were actively directing huge audiences on Twitter.
[1:40:36.400 --> 1:40:44.400]  But there is this criticism that it's an echo chamber, that it's only people on the right, the alt right or whatever. So how are you addressing that?
[1:40:44.400 --> 1:40:56.400]  Sure. So what I would say is that every single social network is an echo chamber that we create and design ourselves. When you friend people on Facebook, when you like things on Facebook, you're creating and molding your own echo chamber on Facebook.
[1:40:56.400 --> 1:41:06.400]  You unfriend people that you disagree with or that you get into political arguments with or whatever. So by nature, by human nature, we end up creating, again, these own little tribes.
[1:41:06.400 --> 1:41:12.400]  Twitter works the same way. Who you choose to follow on Twitter is going to create what you're going to see in your content.
[1:41:12.400 --> 1:41:28.400]  So my answer to that is that every social network is an echo chamber in some way, shape, or form. We're giving you the ability to create and shape and mold your own experience through what we see as individual liberty and user choice versus us acting as big brother, big sister,
[1:41:28.400 --> 1:41:35.400]  and deciding what users should and should not see as a whole. We give you the individual the tools to shape that experience.
[1:41:35.400 --> 1:41:43.400]  And it's a free speech platform, but you know, you have filters. You don't just allow people to post anything whatsoever on there, right?
[1:41:43.400 --> 1:41:55.400]  Yes, it's not an anarchist website, right? It's free speech within legal limits, right? And it's common sense stuff like don't break the law, don't dox people, don't post CP, things of that nature.
[1:41:55.400 --> 1:41:58.400]  Anything illegal, get off the site, right? Take it somewhere else.
[1:41:58.400 --> 1:42:06.400]  No, I mean, but they've tried to frame it as what was the term Twitter for racist? That's the big line they went with.
[1:42:06.400 --> 1:42:08.400]  Twitter is the Twitter for racist.
[1:42:08.400 --> 1:42:14.400]  Well, yeah, totally. It's just a different form of racism, because white people can't be racist. It doesn't exist.
[1:42:14.400 --> 1:42:24.400]  But there was a big gizmodo hit piece, if you want to get that back up on screen. Again, the app was rejected because it was full of race-baiting and hate speech.
[1:42:24.400 --> 1:42:31.400]  Again, I could write articles every single day, and I do, about race-baiting and hate speech on Twitter.
[1:42:31.400 --> 1:42:39.400]  The amount of prominent people with hundreds of thousands of followers on Twitter who have directly called for Donald Trump's assassination,
[1:42:39.400 --> 1:42:45.400]  by talking Indian Eye, a leading writer for the London Times, one of the biggest newspapers in Britain.
[1:42:45.400 --> 1:42:49.400]  That's all acceptable. There's no moral panic over that.
[1:42:49.400 --> 1:42:54.400]  Absolutely not. But as soon as you get a few people on Gab saying some bad things, you have to be banned.
[1:42:54.400 --> 1:43:02.400]  Well, that's the other thing, too, is that a lot of those people were plants. They're paid trolls, or trolls that come in and create edgy,
[1:43:02.400 --> 1:43:07.400]  like as far edgy as you can go, right on that line between breaking our guidelines.
[1:43:07.400 --> 1:43:11.400]  And then what people would do is try and find those people and single them out and say,
[1:43:11.400 --> 1:43:19.400]  well, look, I cherry-picked five different users from the site, so that means this whole site is this. And that's what the media would do to us,
[1:43:19.400 --> 1:43:25.400]  is they would find five or six users that were posting something, I guess you could say objectionable, or mean, or whatever,
[1:43:25.400 --> 1:43:33.400]  and say, well, this is what the whole site is like. And that's just not true. We have a lot of good, honest, hard-working, normal, everyday people on the site.
[1:43:33.400 --> 1:43:40.400]  Now, let's just talk about what stage. So the app's ready to go once it gets approved. You're still trying to work around that.
[1:43:40.400 --> 1:43:45.400]  You've got video uploads because, of course, Twitter's got them now. It's a big deal for Twitter. How's that coming along?
[1:43:45.400 --> 1:43:51.400]  Right. So GAB is completely bootstrapped, right? We didn't take VC funding. We're not bowing down to advertisers.
[1:43:51.400 --> 1:43:59.400]  We're rethinking the social media business model. So instead of having ads, we have GAB Pro, which is a premium version of the product
[1:43:59.400 --> 1:44:06.400]  that users can pay $5.99 a month for and help keep GAB ad-free and get additional features in the process.
[1:44:06.400 --> 1:44:13.400]  That's what I've called forward, Twitter, because it's virtually impossible to get hold of anyone who works for Twitter to address
[1:44:13.400 --> 1:44:22.400]  concerns with band, tweet, censorship, or whatever. I would happily pay to not be censored and just to have some customer service person
[1:44:22.400 --> 1:44:30.400]  at Twitter available for a small monthly fee each month. I would happily do that. A lot of verified people would. So you've already got that on board.
[1:44:30.400 --> 1:44:37.400]  It launched 30 days ago. We have 1,000 of our users that have signed up for this already. And the other thing is we're rethinking
[1:44:37.400 --> 1:44:44.400]  the connection between content creator and audience. So right now, the advertiser, as I'm sure you know, on YouTube, they own all of the
[1:44:44.400 --> 1:44:50.400]  puppet strings, right? Like they are the puppeteer. We want to connect content creators like you directly with your audience
[1:44:50.400 --> 1:44:56.400]  and give the audience a chance to reward you financially with tips and the ability to subscribe to you for additional content.
[1:44:56.400 --> 1:45:03.400]  And that's where we're going with GAB TV, which is our video product and our live streaming product. So it's somewhat of a mix between
[1:45:03.400 --> 1:45:06.400]  Periscope, Facebook Live, and YouTube.
[1:45:06.400 --> 1:45:14.400]  And there you saw we had Alex Jones active on GAB right now. I was active. I need to be more active. You've got Milo on there.
[1:45:14.400 --> 1:45:16.400]  You've got Cernovish's on there, correct?
[1:45:16.400 --> 1:45:23.400]  Yep. Yeah. Cernovish is on there. Milo's on there. Milo just came back. You're on there, obviously. I think you've been traveling.
[1:45:23.400 --> 1:45:30.400]  So it's been a little rough. So yeah, how do people join? I mean, there's this huge waiting list. What's the process?
[1:45:30.400 --> 1:45:38.400]  So today, for the show, obviously, anybody that joins and enters their email into the waiting list, we're sending out invites all day.
[1:45:38.400 --> 1:45:47.400]  So if you sign up today, just enter in your email, look for an invite. But what I would say is we've been getting filtered by Yahoo, by Gmail, by
[1:45:47.400 --> 1:45:56.400]  AOL. AOL just completely blocks our invites. Yahoo throws them. Yeah. Gmail puts them in the spam folder or they put them in the social folder.
[1:45:56.400 --> 1:46:02.400]  So if you just click let me in there and enter in your email address, we'll send out an invite. We'll be sending out thousands all day today.
[1:46:02.400 --> 1:46:07.400]  So anybody that signs up today will send out an invite. You'll be able to create your account and claim your username.
[1:46:07.400 --> 1:46:10.400]  And your waiting list is about to double, probably.
[1:46:10.400 --> 1:46:11.400]  We'll see.
[1:46:11.400 --> 1:46:22.400]  Now, let's talk about YouTube because obviously this has been rumbling along for a good few weeks. Now, it started with the PewDiePie controversy where he started to make edgy jokes about
[1:46:22.400 --> 1:46:38.400]  Nazism dressing up as a Nazi like Charlie Chaplin did or John Cleese, God forbid. The Wall Street Journal basically did a massive demonization hit piece against him, tried to make out that he was a representative of the alt-right and that he was a neo-Nazi.
[1:46:38.400 --> 1:46:52.400]  Basically, decimated his contracts with Disney and these other corporate partners. With PewDiePie, it's the fact that he's got 55 million subscribers. Now, he's not controlled directly by a corporation.
[1:46:52.400 --> 1:47:00.400]  They're panicking about it. He did a video where he talks about how trust in media was declining, especially amongst young people.
[1:47:00.400 --> 1:47:15.400]  So long as he's making videos about goofing off and playing video games, they're not really too concerned. But as soon as he started adding a tiny dose of reality, you can imagine the panic of some of those large media conglomerates for PewDiePie.
[1:47:15.400 --> 1:47:30.400]  Disney almost 55 million subscribers. Just by coincidence, recently on Twitter, he followed yours truly and Stefan Molyneux, which suggests that he might have been taking a few red pills. That's going to cause them to be nervous as well.
[1:47:30.400 --> 1:47:45.400]  They're terrified. I mean, the bottom line is that they're terrified. They're terrified that one individual, three individuals, between yourself, Sernovich, Stefan Molyneux, PewDiePie, you guys are reaching billions of people a quarter.
[1:47:45.400 --> 1:48:01.400]  I mean, that's that's insane. You have where these four or five corporations that control all of media, all of Silicon Valley, they're panicking. And that's why they're panicking is because the power shifting from corporations into the hands of individuals like yourself into the hands of the masses than the people.
[1:48:01.400 --> 1:48:02.400]  And that's that's what they're afraid of.
[1:48:02.400 --> 1:48:17.400]  You look at Rachel Maddow, whose ratings to be fair to her have gone up recently because of all the parses and chip and, you know, polarization. She gets about 2.5 million viewers per night on her show. PewDiePie gets that every day, if not more.
[1:48:17.400 --> 1:48:23.400]  Sometimes you'll get four times that and he's uploading every single day. So it's not as if it's a once a week deal.
[1:48:23.400 --> 1:48:34.400]  So if somebody like PewDiePie suddenly decides to change his content, which he has done to a certain extent, that is in direct competition with big corporate media.
[1:48:34.400 --> 1:48:49.400]  They've never had that kind of competition before. Now we see the demonetization scandal, which is an attempt to cut these independent YouTubers down to size to make them dependent on other other things to discourage them from making controversial content,
[1:48:49.400 --> 1:48:56.400]  which is basically anything that runs counter to an establishment narrative. You were telling me before you came on about a new development with this.
[1:48:56.400 --> 1:49:03.400]  Yeah. Actually, I got a tweet about this about 10 minutes ago and it's from Ethan Klein. He's a huge YouTuber.
[1:49:03.400 --> 1:49:05.400]  Millions of subscribers.
[1:49:05.400 --> 1:49:15.400]  Millions. Yeah. He says, to give you an idea of how messed up YouTube is right now, I put Christian in the title of a new video and it got flagged as religious and made nothing.
[1:49:15.400 --> 1:49:22.400]  Half of our videos are not running ads because they are marked as quote controversial. I truly feel like we have no place left on YouTube.
[1:49:22.400 --> 1:49:32.400]  And that's what they're doing. They're hitting the pocketbooks of the content creators and they're forcing them with these ambiguous terms like hate speech or fake news or harassment.
[1:49:32.400 --> 1:49:51.400]  Anything that's ambiguous and subjective that gives them the leeway to enforce at that will really. And they're forcing these people into self-censorship, right? So you have to kind of dance around the lines and tiptoe around glass when you're creating content to make sure you don't say anything crazy so that you can pay your bills every month, right?
[1:49:51.400 --> 1:50:03.400]  Yeah. I mean, the headline, you can't even put Syria in the headline. Of course, that doesn't apply to CNN or Fox News. They're not demonetized. They had the restricted mode, which we talked about a few weeks ago.
[1:50:03.400 --> 1:50:10.400]  You go on my channel and restricted mode, which is what they're moving towards in terms of moving over to this Netflix type model.
[1:50:10.400 --> 1:50:22.400]  Every single one of my videos is gone on restricted mode. Same for Stefan Molyneux, same for all these other people, some of whom aren't even that political. People like, you know, Philip DeFranco, who again has got millions of subscribers.
[1:50:22.400 --> 1:50:39.400]  He's a centrist. He talks about things from both perspectives. And yet even his channel, most of his videos completely censored in this restricted mode because, again, they're completely afraid of independent content creators just having their own opinions
[1:50:39.400 --> 1:50:48.400]  and not being controlled by megalithic corporations dominating the entire spectrum of acceptable thought and opinion.
[1:50:48.400 --> 1:51:17.400]  We'll be back to talk about it more with Andrew Torber, founder of Gap on the Alex Jones show live breaking news at info wars dot com.
[1:51:17.400 --> 1:51:21.400]  So they decided to start their own shaving company and fix shaving once and for all.
[1:51:21.400 --> 1:51:30.400]  They hired the best designers. They bought a 95 year old German blade factory and they started selling high quality razors online with no upcharging direct to customers.
[1:51:30.400 --> 1:51:34.400]  How did the overpriced razor company respond? By threatening to sue their pants off.
[1:51:34.400 --> 1:51:40.400]  Don't worry, Jeff and Andy have plenty of pants and a relentless dream to get all guys a great shave at a great price.

[1:54:23.400 --> 1:54:28.400]  We are live on the Alex Jones show. We're talking to Andrew Toba, founder of gab.ai.
[1:54:28.400 --> 1:54:32.400]  Andrew, we were just getting into it. You were banned from a startup directory.
[1:54:32.400 --> 1:54:39.400]  I think this happened before the election because they said you made people feel, quote, unsafe.
[1:54:39.400 --> 1:54:40.400]  Right.
[1:54:40.400 --> 1:54:42.400]  This was a Silicon Valley directory.
[1:54:42.400 --> 1:54:49.400]  How hard is it for someone who doesn't identify as progressive to get ahead in Silicon Valley and tell us about what happened with it?
[1:54:49.400 --> 1:54:58.400]  Silicon Valley is all about diversity, unless you are straight, unless you're a Christian, unless you're a male, unless you're a Trump supporter.
[1:54:58.400 --> 1:55:02.400]  They love preaching diversity, unless you're any of those things.
[1:55:02.400 --> 1:55:07.400]  Being there, I was living there, working in the space for about five years.
[1:55:07.400 --> 1:55:12.400]  Being there, you feel like you don't fit in at all.
[1:55:12.400 --> 1:55:17.400]  You feel like you have to keep your beliefs to yourself, otherwise you'll be blacklisted.
[1:55:17.400 --> 1:55:23.400]  And that's what happened to me. So I went to the San Jose Trump rally slash riot.
[1:55:23.400 --> 1:55:31.400]  And I periscoped the riot out front and saw people getting attacked and egged and the American flag being burned.
[1:55:31.400 --> 1:55:35.400]  And that's when I kind of woke up and I was like, you know what? I have to say something.
[1:55:35.400 --> 1:55:39.400]  And when I came out, I guess you could say came out as pro Trump.
[1:55:39.400 --> 1:55:44.400]  Everybody started, you're a racist. You're a bigot. I'm going to stop doing business with you.
[1:55:44.400 --> 1:55:50.400]  People that I respect it, investors, entrepreneurs, very talented people that I had a lot of respect for.
[1:55:50.400 --> 1:55:57.400]  It was very interesting to see that side of human nature because of the divisiveness that happened during this election.
[1:55:57.400 --> 1:56:01.400]  And you were just posting some screenshots of what people were saying about the election.
[1:56:01.400 --> 1:56:04.400]  And they literally thought that was a violent attack on them, right?
[1:56:04.400 --> 1:56:08.400]  Right, yeah. So after the election, I think it was actually election night.
[1:56:08.400 --> 1:56:14.400]  A lot of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs that were in my network on Facebook were just freaking out on Facebook.
[1:56:14.400 --> 1:56:18.400]  So what I was doing is I was screenshotting the text of what they were saying,
[1:56:18.400 --> 1:56:22.400]  not including their actual names or identities, screenshotting the text of what they were saying.
[1:56:22.400 --> 1:56:27.400]  And I was just tweeting out funny memes and trolling them essentially through Twitter anonymously.
[1:56:27.400 --> 1:56:31.400]  And the one was something about, I said, build the wall.
[1:56:31.400 --> 1:56:37.400]  And they claimed that they felt like they were unsafe or threatened by my tweet.
[1:56:37.400 --> 1:56:45.400]  And they said that it was harassment and I was making them feel like they were not welcome or just they spun it in some way.
[1:56:45.400 --> 1:56:51.400]  So, you know, again, for months after I, I guess, quote unquote, came out pro Trump for about six months,
[1:56:51.400 --> 1:57:00.400]  I was hounded on a daily basis and, you know, attacked and called a racist and a bigot and Islamophobe and up and down the whole ladder.
[1:57:00.400 --> 1:57:02.400]  And this really kind of threw me over the edge.
[1:57:02.400 --> 1:57:08.400]  And I was like, you know what, screw you guys, like I want anything to do with you, like just leave me alone, f off, whatever.
[1:57:08.400 --> 1:57:14.400]  And, you know, then they tried to spin zone it into making me the bad guy and saying that I was making people feel unsafe.
[1:57:14.400 --> 1:57:20.400]  And they removed me from the network, the Y Combinator Network and, you know, made a big deal out about it.
[1:57:20.400 --> 1:57:22.400]  But it wasn't a big deal to me.
[1:57:22.400 --> 1:57:27.400]  So again, it goes to the heart of, you know, the real intellectual intolerance is always on the left.
[1:57:27.400 --> 1:57:32.400]  Again, they love diversity until it comes to diversity of opinion, right?
[1:57:32.400 --> 1:57:33.400]  Exactly.
[1:57:33.400 --> 1:57:36.400]  All right, we're going to get back into it with Andrew Torber in the next segment.
[1:57:36.400 --> 1:57:41.400]  First, I want to tell you how you can support us because we're constantly under attack on a daily basis,
[1:57:41.400 --> 1:57:48.400]  whether it's media matters, whether it's CNN, whoever, we're under constant assault and we depend on your support.
[1:57:48.400 --> 1:57:52.400]  They are trying to remove our base of advertising.
[1:57:52.400 --> 1:57:57.400]  We had the Ad Roll debacle back a few weeks ago as we talked about with Andrew.
[1:57:57.400 --> 1:58:06.400]  We had the YouTube demonetization, which has basically cut off 75% of our income on YouTube to massive, huge blows.
[1:58:06.400 --> 1:58:12.400]  But thankfully, because of your support, getting the products we have managed to survive and thrive.
[1:58:12.400 --> 1:58:23.400]  The Easter mega specials have been extended until tonight only at InfowarsStore.com, 30% off brain force, 25% off supermail vitality.
[1:58:23.400 --> 1:58:29.400]  All those specials are available for a limited time only at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:58:29.400 --> 1:58:33.400]  Get the great products, continue to support the growth of this network.
[1:58:33.400 --> 1:58:37.400]  We'll be back with Andrew Torber in the next segment, Infowars.com.
[1:58:37.400 --> 1:58:42.400]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[1:58:42.400 --> 1:59:08.400]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[1:59:12.400 --> 1:59:19.400]  We're live in the wilds having to build civilization that are our superior ancestors and we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[1:59:19.400 --> 1:59:27.400]  Everyone knew you used all the parts of the animal. You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[1:59:27.400 --> 1:59:35.400]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[1:59:35.400 --> 1:59:43.400]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were and this is a big part of it.
[1:59:43.400 --> 2:00:11.400]  I know you're going to want to check out caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself at InfowarsLive.com today.
[2:00:11.400 --> 2:00:40.400]  We are back with Andrew Torber, the founder of gab.ai, the new social media platform for free speech, truly unbridled free speech,
[2:00:40.400 --> 2:00:45.400]  not subject to the whims of Twitter censorship.
[2:00:45.400 --> 2:00:52.400]  Andrew, I just want to ask you about that actually. What are the different methods of censorship that we've seen on Twitter because people talk a lot about shadow banning.
[2:00:52.400 --> 2:01:01.400]  Obviously people have had their accounts directly suspended, Milo, they never come back, you never see them again, but there are more underhanded methods that they use, right?
[2:01:01.400 --> 2:01:11.400]  Yeah, and they're actually admitting this now, so for the longest time we assume that shadow banning was going on and you can kind of glimpse it by the engagement on your account for about 12, 18 months.
[2:01:11.400 --> 2:01:21.400]  Now they come out and say, well, this is a safety feature, we're doing this to keep you guys safe and we're hiding what do they call it, sensitive replies or exactly positive replies to Donald Trump's tweets.
[2:01:21.400 --> 2:01:23.400]  Just go to any one of Trump's tweets and look down the list.
[2:01:23.400 --> 2:01:30.400]  I've highlighted this over and over again. They get people who've got alerts on their phone and they claim that they're not bots.
[2:01:30.400 --> 2:01:37.400]  There are actually leftists who will sit with an alert for whenever Donald Trump tweets, even if it's at like, what, 5am?
[2:01:37.400 --> 2:01:38.400]  Right.
[2:01:38.400 --> 2:01:47.400]  They will get on there and write a literal essay in 75 parts and it will go immediately to the top and it will stay there.
[2:01:47.400 --> 2:01:56.400]  I've managed to challenge it a couple of times, but 9 times out of 10 negative responses to every Trump tweet and they make sure they stick at the top.
[2:01:56.400 --> 2:01:57.400]  You think that's deliberate?
[2:01:57.400 --> 2:02:02.400]  Oh, it's absolutely deliberate and actually I question whether or not there are bots.
[2:02:02.400 --> 2:02:11.400]  William Legate, one of the top blue verified guys who's the top of almost every one of Trump's tweets, he actually tried to sign up with 20 plus GAB accounts yesterday.
[2:02:11.400 --> 2:02:12.400]  Really?
[2:02:12.400 --> 2:02:19.400]  So I question whether or not and how many sock puppet accounts he actually has on Twitter retweeting his own stuff to get it up there quicker.
[2:02:19.400 --> 2:02:29.400]  And then also on our end, I've tested this, I've seen your test with it as well, on GAB's end we've tested a reply like, I get the alerts and I'll instantly reply to him and say like, is this tweet going to be removed?
[2:02:29.400 --> 2:02:33.400]  And what they'll do is they'll actually de-thread the tweet from the reply.
[2:02:33.400 --> 2:02:39.400]  So they'll take our reply and they'll actually remove it completely from the thread, which is like two or three times in a row it happened to me.
[2:02:39.400 --> 2:02:42.400]  It's like crazy, just completely remove it so you can't see it.
[2:02:42.400 --> 2:02:45.400]  And of course they're doing it because it's the same with comment sections.
[2:02:45.400 --> 2:03:00.400]  This is why a lot of big mainstream media websites removed comment sections altogether because they've done studies where they show the comment sections are actually seen by readers as more indicative of the truth behind the story than the actual content of the story.
[2:03:00.400 --> 2:03:04.400]  So they read the story or part of it and they think, well, I'm not sure about this, what do other people think?
[2:03:04.400 --> 2:03:05.400]  Right.
[2:03:05.400 --> 2:03:07.400]  And they base their ultimate opinion.
[2:03:07.400 --> 2:03:08.400]  Confirmation bias.
[2:03:08.400 --> 2:03:10.400]  Yeah, more on the comments than the actual story.
[2:03:10.400 --> 2:03:18.400]  So if you see trashing of Trump's tweets over and over again, you're more likely to side with those kind of people if you're kind of in the middle, right?
[2:03:18.400 --> 2:03:19.400]  Yeah, absolutely.
[2:03:19.400 --> 2:03:21.400]  It's psychological warfare, right?
[2:03:21.400 --> 2:03:32.400]  So what it is, it's psychological conditioning and psychological warfare where if you're looking at Trump's tweets and all you see is negative replies and people bashing him, you must think, wow, like Twitter's a massive social network.
[2:03:32.400 --> 2:03:34.400]  There's 300 million people on here supposedly.
[2:03:34.400 --> 2:03:36.400]  Everybody must really hate Trump.
[2:03:36.400 --> 2:03:43.400]  You don't see any positive reply and it creates this conditioning around perception of him and perception of what he's doing.
[2:03:43.400 --> 2:03:45.400]  And it's scary stuff.
[2:03:45.400 --> 2:03:47.400]  It's like it's psychological conditioning.
[2:03:47.400 --> 2:03:55.400]  And you would expect it to be, you know, in leftist favor given that there are more prominent verified lashes probably on Twitter, but not 99 to 100 percent.
[2:03:55.400 --> 2:03:57.400]  You look at Facebook, it's different, right?
[2:03:57.400 --> 2:04:00.400]  There's mainly positive responses when it comes to Trump.
[2:04:00.400 --> 2:04:08.400]  Yeah, and Facebook's a little bit more difficult to censor at scale because they have probably three or four X the amount of people that Twitter do.
[2:04:08.400 --> 2:04:10.400]  And also it's a different media.
[2:04:10.400 --> 2:04:17.400]  But what Facebook is doing is they have obviously the newsfeed algorithm, which works in mysterious ways.
[2:04:17.400 --> 2:04:23.400]  And then they have obviously, you know, the manipulation of the trending topics product, you know, from last year, which we were talking about earlier.
[2:04:23.400 --> 2:04:26.400]  So there are different ways that they are doing it as well.
[2:04:26.400 --> 2:04:32.400]  Roger Stone was talking about how he's lost basically 90 percent of his engagement on Facebook.
[2:04:32.400 --> 2:04:39.400]  So we can talk about that, how they're coming against us again with the manipulation of Twitter as well with the Watson AI thing that you were talking about.
[2:04:39.400 --> 2:04:46.400]  We will be back with Andrew Torber, founder of Gab, and we got more breaking news in the pipeline.
[2:04:46.400 --> 2:04:50.400]  This is the Alex Jones show live info wars dot com.
[2:04:50.400 --> 2:04:57.400]  Go away.
[2:05:20.400 --> 2:05:31.400]  If you take a look at his Facebook page, you'll notice a meme he posted recently about White House chief strategist, Steve Bannon, who according to Mohammed is a white devil.
[2:05:31.400 --> 2:05:42.400]  But on the other hand, the Fresno killer says he does like MSNBC, CNN, Van Jones, the Young Turks, and of course, Black Lives Matter.
[2:05:42.400 --> 2:05:50.400]  So far, it's unclear if his rampage was based on watching left wing media inspired by BLM or his religion.
[2:05:50.400 --> 2:05:54.400]  We will continue to bring destruction to the back of prime America.
[2:05:54.400 --> 2:06:19.400]  You can learn more right now at info wars dot com.
[2:06:19.400 --> 2:06:26.400]  Super blue fluoride free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula that's loaded with good halogen iodine said the bad halogen fluoride.
[2:06:26.400 --> 2:06:33.400]  Super blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[2:06:33.400 --> 2:06:45.400]  Just some of the ingredients in super blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more due to requests from listeners who found that spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children.
[2:06:45.400 --> 2:06:49.400]  We have created the new bubblegum flavored super blue that is spearmint free.
[2:06:49.400 --> 2:07:18.400]  Learn more about the new bubblegum flavored super blue toothpaste and more at info wars life dot com and support the info war while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[2:07:18.400 --> 2:07:24.400]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[2:07:24.400 --> 2:07:37.400]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity and you're looking for a convenient easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day to day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients,

[2:07:54.400 --> 2:08:16.400]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance you're listening to Alex Jones.
[2:08:16.400 --> 2:08:32.400]  We are live on the Alex Jones show with Andrew Torber, the founder of gab dot ai.
[2:08:32.400 --> 2:08:34.400]  People talk about Europe.
[2:08:34.400 --> 2:08:36.400]  People talk about free speech censorship.
[2:08:36.400 --> 2:08:39.400]  Of course, it's incredibly more intense over there.
[2:08:39.400 --> 2:08:44.400]  We have this argument, Andrew over and over again, Twitter and Facebook are just private companies.
[2:08:44.400 --> 2:08:46.400]  They can do what they like, they can censor who they like.
[2:08:46.400 --> 2:08:48.400]  It's not really the case anymore, is it?
[2:08:48.400 --> 2:08:51.400]  When they're literally working with governments in Germany, for example.
[2:08:51.400 --> 2:08:59.400]  Working with Stasi members, ex-members of the Stasi in one case, to hunt down people who post, quote, hate speech.
[2:08:59.400 --> 2:09:04.400]  Of course, when you drill into it in some cases, it's criticism of immigration policies.
[2:09:04.400 --> 2:09:09.400]  They're literally working hand in hand with governments to hunt down people.
[2:09:09.400 --> 2:09:13.400]  So at that point, it's no longer about, oh, it's just a private company, correct?
[2:09:13.400 --> 2:09:22.400]  Absolutely, and I think when you look at the scale, the size of these networks, the monopolies that they have on communication, on information, on news.
[2:09:22.400 --> 2:09:29.400]  How can you say, yes, they are a private company, but at some point it's like, how are they not considered a utility at the size that they're at right now?
[2:09:29.400 --> 2:09:36.400]  You look at what's happening in Germany and in France, where they're cracking down on quote, unquote, fake news and quote, unquote, hate speech.
[2:09:36.400 --> 2:09:44.400]  Which are two very subjective terms, you know, making social networks pay up to 50 million euros for not taking down fake news.
[2:09:44.400 --> 2:09:46.400]  In 24 hours, which is totally impossible.
[2:09:46.400 --> 2:09:47.400]  Right.
[2:09:47.400 --> 2:09:51.400]  And who decides what the fake news is and who decides what the hate speech is?
[2:09:51.400 --> 2:09:54.400]  Is that Germany? Is that someone on Facebook's team? Is that a third party?
[2:09:54.400 --> 2:09:58.400]  It's Angela Merkel and Mark Zuckerberg basically at this point.
[2:09:58.400 --> 2:10:03.400]  Right, exactly. And you see Facebook, you know, bending the knee to censorship in a lot of different ways.
[2:10:03.400 --> 2:10:08.400]  You look at the way that they're creating a censorship tool to break into China.
[2:10:08.400 --> 2:10:15.400]  You know, they're actively trying to break into China by saying, OK, yeah, we'll censor, we'll create a censorship tool for the Chinese government to use.
[2:10:15.400 --> 2:10:16.400]  That's fine.
[2:10:16.400 --> 2:10:19.400]  Yeah, the Chinese government actually came out years ago and said, we need this tool.
[2:10:19.400 --> 2:10:27.400]  And they use it over and over again, not just with social media, but they shut down the entire internet in parts of the country where there's social unrest.
[2:10:27.400 --> 2:10:34.400]  And Facebook and these other companies basically had to agree to get on board and to carry that out on behalf of the Chinese government.
[2:10:34.400 --> 2:10:38.400]  Otherwise, they would get no access into the country and they just went right along with it, correct?
[2:10:38.400 --> 2:10:40.400]  Absolutely. Yeah, it's all about market share for them.
[2:10:40.400 --> 2:10:42.400]  It's anything to break into that market, they'll do.
[2:10:42.400 --> 2:10:44.400]  It doesn't matter about the free speech.
[2:10:44.400 --> 2:10:48.400]  It doesn't matter about, you know, free flow of communication information.
[2:10:48.400 --> 2:10:51.400]  It's about making more money and increasing their market share.
[2:10:51.400 --> 2:10:57.400]  Now, we talked about Twitter's problem with bots, with people being able to game the algorithm as they claim.
[2:10:57.400 --> 2:11:05.400]  Of course, there are claims flying from the opposite direction that everything we do is bots, that all my followers are bots and all the retweets are bots.
[2:11:05.400 --> 2:11:13.400]  In fact, Fresno, you had the Fresno shooting yesterday where people on the left were claiming that this went to the top of the Twitter hashtags,
[2:11:13.400 --> 2:11:20.400]  not because it was a multi-victim shooting and because it was a breaking news story and it would normally go to the top of the trends,
[2:11:20.400 --> 2:11:27.400]  but because bots were tweeting out, retweeting, Cernovich's tweets, my tweets, Jack, possibly X tweets.
[2:11:27.400 --> 2:11:33.400]  How does Gab deal with bots? How are you going to prevent that algorithm being gamed by these people?
[2:11:33.400 --> 2:11:39.400]  Sure. So I think from day one, Twitter has had a very poor relationship with developers.
[2:11:39.400 --> 2:11:42.400]  I think that's the first problem that they've had.
[2:11:42.400 --> 2:11:51.400]  So it's very easy for a lot of different people to create accounts quickly, get on their API, and get up a bot account running in under five minutes.
[2:11:51.400 --> 2:11:57.400]  So first of all, I was like, we don't have an API yet, so developers can't access that. They can't create bot accounts.
[2:11:57.400 --> 2:12:09.400]  And what we want to do is change the game in terms of working directly with developers and creating a great relationship with them from day one to create useful bots.
[2:12:09.400 --> 2:12:19.400]  So if we are going to have bots, they're going to be useful, something like a weather bot where you can gab at a weather bot any time of the day and get instant weather from anywhere,
[2:12:19.400 --> 2:12:27.400]  or have it push weather information to you. So as opposed to just 48 million stale accounts that just retweet and favor things to boost them up,
[2:12:27.400 --> 2:12:33.400]  we want to create useful content-based bots that actually help people and give them information.
[2:12:33.400 --> 2:12:45.400]  We had the article up there before. The FBI was reportedly investigating in Four Wars and Brightbot to see if our stories were being artificially amplified by bots.
[2:12:45.400 --> 2:12:53.400]  Where that falls down is, you know, I've got 900,000 YouTube subscribers, okay? You can't fake the views.
[2:12:53.400 --> 2:12:59.400]  You can't fake 10, 15, 20,000 individual comments on YouTube videos.
[2:12:59.400 --> 2:13:03.400]  The audience on every platform has grown comparatively together.
[2:13:03.400 --> 2:13:07.400]  So it's not a case of suddenly an onrush of bots came in.
[2:13:07.400 --> 2:13:14.400]  When you can go to another platform, you can go to Facebook and see how many hundreds of thousands of followers I've got and the engagement is the same.
[2:13:14.400 --> 2:13:18.400]  It's rising on a consistent basis across all three platforms.
[2:13:18.400 --> 2:13:23.400]  So that in and of itself disproves this ridiculous claim that it's bots.
[2:13:23.400 --> 2:13:26.400]  I mean, did bots vote for Donald Trump? Did they go to the polls?
[2:13:26.400 --> 2:13:40.400]  Right. I mean, that's the thing. You know, a few months ago, you saw the New York Times and other prominent, you know, I guess mainstream media websites that they were using bots out of China to boost their website ranks and to get more visitors to their site.
[2:13:40.400 --> 2:13:45.400]  I mean, there are, when somebody's using bots, there are measurable ways. Like you said, look at the data.
[2:13:45.400 --> 2:13:52.400]  You guys have been progressively growing over time at a normal growth rate. It's not like it just shot up overnight and you gotta let it fall.
[2:13:52.400 --> 2:13:55.400]  Exactly. It's like who's buying the products? Is that Russian bots?
[2:13:55.400 --> 2:13:58.400]  Right. Because it's all gone up at the same speed.
[2:13:58.400 --> 2:13:59.400]  Right. Exactly.
[2:13:59.400 --> 2:14:03.400]  I mean, it's incredible. How can they continue to claim it? We got a zero hedge.
[2:14:03.400 --> 2:14:06.400]  All the New York Times, Guardian, Washington Post buying clicks.
[2:14:06.400 --> 2:14:12.400]  So they've been caught doing exactly what they accused us of doing. Again, you look at many of these prominent Twitter accounts.
[2:14:12.400 --> 2:14:16.400]  Usually it's, you know, they're buying. You can buy fake followers on Twitter, right?
[2:14:16.400 --> 2:14:23.400]  Yeah. You can do a Twitter audit too. I think it's what Twitter audit.com and check to see how many, how many bots and how many fake followers you have.
[2:14:23.400 --> 2:14:29.400]  What do you think of this Louise Mench narrative then that everything is Russian bot related?
[2:14:29.400 --> 2:14:35.400]  Yeah. She thinks that we're a quote NSA honey pod or something like that. She's come after us a bunch.
[2:14:35.400 --> 2:14:41.400]  She claims a lot of things on a day-to-day basis. Talk to me about this Watson AI thing that Twitter's using.
[2:14:41.400 --> 2:14:48.400]  Yeah. That's some scary stuff. So Twitter partnered with IBM and they're using Watson famous for being on Twitter.
[2:14:48.400 --> 2:14:49.400]  No relation.
[2:14:49.400 --> 2:14:54.400]  Famous for being I think the first robot contestant on Jeopardy or something like that.
[2:14:54.400 --> 2:15:05.400]  And what they're using it for is to automatically flag temporarily suspend permanently suspend users and content before there's any actual human report.
[2:15:05.400 --> 2:15:15.400]  So it doesn't even have to be reported by another user on Twitter for the AI to pick it up and censor it or, you know, lock you out of your account for 12 hours or suspend your account.
[2:15:15.400 --> 2:15:17.400]  It's keywords that they're using, right?
[2:15:17.400 --> 2:15:21.400]  Yeah. And only, I guess, only Twitter and IBM know what those keywords are.
[2:15:21.400 --> 2:15:25.400]  But you can just you can, I guess, discover it pretty quickly when you get suspended.
[2:15:25.400 --> 2:15:29.400]  And it's again, it's this double standard of abuse and harassment.
[2:15:29.400 --> 2:15:35.400]  I had to close open DMs on Twitter because it was just an absolute sewer every day.
[2:15:35.400 --> 2:15:40.400]  We're going to kill you. We know where you live. You're a pedophile. That's not coming from the right wing.
[2:15:40.400 --> 2:15:49.400]  Obviously, there are people on the right that harass people. But in terms of my experience, in terms of many other people's experience, it definitely goes both ways.
[2:15:49.400 --> 2:15:56.400]  But the only narrative you ever see in the media is that it's the alt-right, the far-right that are responsible for this harassment.
[2:15:56.400 --> 2:15:58.400]  This is why we need to censor social media.
[2:15:58.400 --> 2:16:04.400]  That's not going to go away because the left is equally, if not more intolerant and bullying.
[2:16:04.400 --> 2:16:06.400]  And I've experienced that. You must have experienced that.
[2:16:06.400 --> 2:16:10.400]  I experienced it every day. I can't even imagine. You have, what, 500,000 mentions on your Twitter account.
[2:16:10.400 --> 2:16:14.400]  I saw your data the other day. 500,000 mentions a month. How do you even...
[2:16:14.400 --> 2:16:16.400]  I don't check them.
[2:16:16.400 --> 2:16:19.400]  Yeah. I mean, it gets to the point where you have to use the mute future.
[2:16:19.400 --> 2:16:24.400]  You have to block people, whatever you have to do, because there are some that just don't stop.
[2:16:24.400 --> 2:16:26.400]  It's all day, every single day.
[2:16:26.400 --> 2:16:30.400]  And it's like, we use our Twitter account to actually try and help people get on or with support and things of that nature.
[2:16:30.400 --> 2:16:37.400]  So it becomes impossible to actually, you know, be productive when you have all that noise and all that negativity coming at you all day long.
[2:16:37.400 --> 2:16:41.400]  Yeah. And there's also a double standard in terms of reporting.
[2:16:41.400 --> 2:16:47.400]  You report somebody to Facebook for, you know, a direct death threat and you get the message back a couple of days like,
[2:16:47.400 --> 2:16:49.400]  this does not violate our terms of agreement.
[2:16:49.400 --> 2:16:50.400]  Right. Right.
[2:16:50.400 --> 2:16:56.400]  Yet certain words, like the word faggot for homosexual or even in a food sense or whatever, that's banned.
[2:16:56.400 --> 2:17:03.400]  That's an immediate 30 day ban, even if it's Milo Yiannopoulos who calls his own tour the dangerous faggot tour.
[2:17:03.400 --> 2:17:05.400]  That's what I got suspended for on Facebook.
[2:17:05.400 --> 2:17:14.400]  I shared a trailer to his dangerous faggot tour and they locked me out of my account for 24 hours because the word faggot in the video.
[2:17:14.400 --> 2:17:15.400]  Which is what he calls his tour.
[2:17:15.400 --> 2:17:16.400]  That's what he calls it.
[2:17:16.400 --> 2:17:17.400]  I wasn't even using that.
[2:17:17.400 --> 2:17:19.400]  He's a gay man and that's what he wants to call it.
[2:17:19.400 --> 2:17:20.400]  Right.
[2:17:20.400 --> 2:17:29.400]  He's like, you know, I've had Islamist death threat me. We had Antifa publicly post on Twitter solicitation for my address.
[2:17:29.400 --> 2:17:31.400]  So people could come around and, you know, do whatever.
[2:17:31.400 --> 2:17:32.400]  Very common stuff.
[2:17:32.400 --> 2:17:35.400]  They did the same thing to my friend who lived about two miles away.
[2:17:35.400 --> 2:17:37.400]  They went round to his address.
[2:17:37.400 --> 2:17:38.400]  It's the same account.
[2:17:38.400 --> 2:17:40.400]  It's under police investigation.
[2:17:40.400 --> 2:17:42.400]  I report it to Twitter.
[2:17:42.400 --> 2:17:43.400]  No.
[2:17:43.400 --> 2:17:44.400]  This does not violate.
[2:17:44.400 --> 2:17:45.400]  Right.
[2:17:45.400 --> 2:17:48.400]  Yeah. Milo can criticize a Ghostbusters actor and he's gone.
[2:17:48.400 --> 2:17:49.400]  He's gone.
[2:17:49.400 --> 2:17:50.400]  Right.
[2:17:50.400 --> 2:17:51.400]  Absolutely incredible.
[2:17:51.400 --> 2:17:52.400]  He's gone for being criticized as a movie.
[2:17:52.400 --> 2:17:53.400]  Talk about that double standard.
[2:17:53.400 --> 2:17:54.400]  I mean, it's insane.
[2:17:54.400 --> 2:17:55.400]  Yeah.
[2:17:55.400 --> 2:18:04.400]  I mean, there was one example that I saw where somebody created, you know, two or three accounts and they did a test and one of them was like, I'm going to kill all white people.
[2:18:04.400 --> 2:18:06.400]  And the other one was, I'm going to kill all black people.
[2:18:06.400 --> 2:18:09.400]  And the one that said I'm going to kill all black people was banned.
[2:18:09.400 --> 2:18:12.400]  And the one that said I'm going to kill all white people was let go.
[2:18:12.400 --> 2:18:14.400]  So it's like, why is there this double standard?
[2:18:14.400 --> 2:18:18.400]  If you're going to enforce your rules, at least enforce them equally.
[2:18:18.400 --> 2:18:33.400]  And that's the problem is that, you know, you have these companies that are based in Silicon Valley in San Francisco, which is one of the most liberally progressive cities on the planet, arguably, with liberally progressive employees, liberally progressive management and liberally progressive leadership.
[2:18:33.400 --> 2:18:38.400]  So why should you expect that they are not going to enforce the rules on one side?
[2:18:38.400 --> 2:18:41.400]  I mean, look at Twitter's Trust and Safety Council.
[2:18:41.400 --> 2:18:50.400]  It was made up of about 19 or 20 groups that were left-leaning until people started making a commotion about that and they finally brought in like one right-leaning group.
[2:18:50.400 --> 2:18:51.400]  Vaguely conservative.
[2:18:51.400 --> 2:18:52.400]  Yeah, vaguely conservative groups.
[2:18:52.400 --> 2:18:59.400]  Same thing with Facebook where they flew out Glenn Beck after the trending topics debacle and all of a sudden everything was supposed to be okay.
[2:18:59.400 --> 2:19:06.400]  Final minute, Andrew Tauber, just tell people again how they can get signed up or at least on the waiting list for GAB.
[2:19:06.400 --> 2:19:07.400]  Sure.
[2:19:07.400 --> 2:19:11.400]  So go to gab.ai, enter your email address.
[2:19:11.400 --> 2:19:13.400]  We're sending out invites literally as we speak right now.

[2:20:28.400 --> 2:20:30.400]  And I couldn't believe the number of great applicants we got.
[2:20:30.400 --> 2:20:32.400]  I had the person we needed within one week.
[2:20:32.400 --> 2:20:35.400]  I don't know how we hired before Zip Recruiter.

[2:23:33.400 --> 2:23:37.400]  Deep State was first revealed in the runaway New York Times bestseller Big Agenda.
[2:23:37.400 --> 2:23:43.400]  David Horowitz's Big Agenda exposes Obama's government in exile and his shocking plan.

[2:23:58.400 --> 2:24:02.400]  Federal agents, we are armed!
[2:24:02.400 --> 2:24:32.120]  We are back live on the Alex Jones show we talked about the French
[2:24:32.120 --> 2:24:37.560]  election earlier we talked about one of the candidates Milan Sean whose policies
[2:24:37.560 --> 2:24:41.920]  are transparently disastrous well now he's almost transparent because we have
[2:24:41.920 --> 2:24:46.520]  this headline out of vessel news French presidential candidate Milan Sean uses
[2:24:46.520 --> 2:24:52.120]  holograms to speak at seven rallies as April 23rd French presidential election
[2:24:52.120 --> 2:24:55.280]  approaches candidates are predictably stomping to bring voters out but far
[2:24:55.280 --> 2:24:59.320]  left candidate Sean Luke Milan Sean may have the most effective strategy yet
[2:24:59.320 --> 2:25:04.280]  using an optical illusion he beamed holograms of himself to sick cities
[2:25:04.280 --> 2:25:09.640]  around the country Milan Sean who's often compared to Bernie Sanders also Hugo
[2:25:09.640 --> 2:25:15.200]  Chavez uses a technique known as Peppers ghost to broadcast a 2d version of
[2:25:15.200 --> 2:25:19.680]  himself from Dijon he simultaneously appeared in seven places at once
[2:25:19.680 --> 2:25:27.560]  yesterday there you see it on screen seven places at once via hologram
[2:25:27.560 --> 2:25:32.280]  actually quite an ingenious campaigning model they're taking place in France
[2:25:32.280 --> 2:25:37.640]  they're saying he's not the first modern user of the trick memorably in 2012 a
[2:25:37.640 --> 2:25:41.080]  hologram of two-pack appeared at Coachella with help from the technique
[2:25:41.080 --> 2:25:44.640]  nor is it the first time Milan Sean himself has used it in February while
[2:25:44.640 --> 2:25:49.320]  kicking off his campaign he virtually appeared in a Paris suburb after being
[2:25:49.320 --> 2:25:55.160]  filmed in Leon so of course a lot of quips to be made about a transparent
[2:25:55.160 --> 2:25:59.920]  candidate there but quite ingenious that he can appear at several different
[2:25:59.920 --> 2:26:04.200]  places at the same time via hologram there you see the two-pack version of
[2:26:04.200 --> 2:26:09.640]  it back in 2012 absolutely amazing how things are advancing sticking on the
[2:26:09.640 --> 2:26:15.680]  subject of technology this is somewhat more chilling this is out of Barron's
[2:26:15.680 --> 2:26:20.320]  headline Facebook CEO Zuckerberg staring at a blank wall is going to be a
[2:26:20.320 --> 2:26:25.640]  thing this was Zuckerberg yesterday talking about the future of Facebook
[2:26:25.640 --> 2:26:32.280]  and augmented reality or virtual reality in terms of a future Facebook
[2:26:32.280 --> 2:26:38.440]  development he's talking about a place for you to be yourself in virtual
[2:26:38.440 --> 2:26:44.200]  reality with your real friends he's talking about a chip in plan or some
[2:26:44.200 --> 2:26:48.720]  kind of quote direct brain interface that will quote one day let you
[2:26:48.720 --> 2:26:54.800]  communicate using only your mind so literally talking about plugging people
[2:26:54.800 --> 2:26:58.880]  into the matrix you remember people were plugged into the matrix via the brain
[2:26:58.880 --> 2:27:04.560]  interface now Zuckerberg wants that he wants that to be the new mode of
[2:27:04.560 --> 2:27:09.000]  social communications kind of funny reminds me of that South Park episode
[2:27:09.000 --> 2:27:15.280]  where Cartman's every thought is turned into a tweet and tweeted out they also
[2:27:15.280 --> 2:27:19.560]  had the scene where they were all be meeting in virtual reality and blocking
[2:27:19.560 --> 2:27:24.200]  each other and it kind of turned out to be an absolute disaster but now
[2:27:24.200 --> 2:27:30.920]  Zuckerberg wants to develop a mind reading brain interface and that's not
[2:27:30.920 --> 2:27:36.400]  going to be abused at all is it you can trust Mark Zuckerberg people will no
[2:27:36.400 --> 2:27:40.240]  longer need to type their dumb boring 20 paragraph virtue signaling posts
[2:27:40.240 --> 2:27:45.360]  physically Facebook's just gonna read your mind and send it out there into
[2:27:45.360 --> 2:27:50.640]  cyberspace but don't worry they really respect your privacy they're not going
[2:27:50.640 --> 2:27:55.920]  to do anything else with it just like Samsung TVs don't spy on you don't
[2:27:55.920 --> 2:28:00.760]  listen to your conversations it's all gonna be perfectly fine absolutely
[2:28:00.760 --> 2:28:05.960]  amazing of course we had Google back I think it was about 10 years ago and that
[2:28:05.960 --> 2:28:08.920]  was the old-style technology talking about you know Eric Schmidt
[2:28:08.920 --> 2:28:13.480]  microphones hanging from the ceiling that would pick up your every word we
[2:28:13.480 --> 2:28:19.160]  now have that with Amazon echo with the Google equivalent but it's just if you
[2:28:19.160 --> 2:28:22.560]  want to know what the weather's like you can talk to the friendly Amazon echo
[2:28:22.560 --> 2:28:27.120]  and they're not recording your conversations just like Samsung was not
[2:28:27.120 --> 2:28:31.560]  recording your conversations and uploading them directly to the CIA oh
[2:28:31.560 --> 2:28:36.200]  no actually turns out they were but you can trust Mark Zuckerberg you can trust
[2:28:36.200 --> 2:28:42.560]  Google not to do the same absolutely incredible we've got more news here
[2:28:42.560 --> 2:28:47.280]  looking at the global perspective Polish government is out of Breitbart
[2:28:47.280 --> 2:28:52.560]  Polish government will not allow bloody harvest of multiculturalism of course
[2:28:52.560 --> 2:28:56.480]  Poland has been one of the countries that has resisted this the Polish
[2:28:56.480 --> 2:29:00.560]  Interior Minister affirmed Poland will not repeat the Western European policy
[2:29:00.560 --> 2:29:04.960]  multiculturalism which he said has led to the bloody harvest of multiple terror
[2:29:04.960 --> 2:29:09.760]  attacks across the continent since the start of the migrant crisis quote the
[2:29:09.760 --> 2:29:12.880]  policy of multiculturalism in Western Europe is bringing about bloody
[2:29:12.880 --> 2:29:17.240]  harvest in the form of terror attacks they're basically resisting demands by
[2:29:17.240 --> 2:29:22.280]  the EU to take in more migrants from Africa as we move towards the warmer
[2:29:22.280 --> 2:29:26.920]  weather and another deluge of migrants as I explained on the show Monday
[2:29:26.920 --> 2:29:31.760]  they're providing a literal taxi service 11 miles off the coast of Libya to bring
[2:29:31.760 --> 2:29:36.400]  in migrants from West Africa who aren't even refugees who aren't even from
[2:29:36.400 --> 2:29:41.840]  Libya while the Turkish president says it's a weapon against the West we will
[2:29:41.840 --> 2:29:47.160]  be back with Mike Cernovich it's the Alex Jones show live info wars.com don't

[2:29:54.040 --> 2:29:57.000]  radio network
[2:29:57.000 --> 2:30:03.800]  according to the mainstream media president Donald Trump was mean to
[2:30:03.800 --> 2:30:08.840]  kids on Easter Sunday that's right dozens of news outlets ran with a
[2:30:08.840 --> 2:30:13.400]  misleading video claiming that president Trump signed a kids make
[2:30:13.400 --> 2:30:18.440]  America great again hat and then threw it away from the kid into the crowd the
[2:30:18.440 --> 2:30:22.640]  video quickly went viral racking up nearly 10,000 retweets and getting
[2:30:22.640 --> 2:30:27.720]  picked up by other news outlets the Washington Post reported Trump using a
[2:30:27.720 --> 2:30:32.080]  thick sharpie put his signature on the bill of the cap then looked up and
[2:30:32.080 --> 2:30:37.800]  lobbed it into the crowd nowhere near the hand that had given it to him Buzz
[2:30:37.800 --> 2:30:41.640]  Feet even claimed that the poor kid never got his hat back but in reality
[2:30:41.640 --> 2:30:46.400]  other camera angles clearly show the president and the kid were just having
[2:30:46.400 --> 2:30:51.440]  fun and the boy indeed caught his hat signed by the president of the United

[2:33:17.440 --> 2:33:32.760]  we are live on the Alex Jones show we're waiting to talk to Mike Cernovich for
[2:33:32.760 --> 2:33:36.280]  the moment we're going to talk about what happened yesterday in Auburn with
[2:33:36.280 --> 2:33:41.600]  and Tifa once again we had the Battle of Berkeley 2 on the weekend we had
[2:33:41.600 --> 2:33:46.120]  another event where Richard Spencer was giving a speech the big alt-right figure
[2:33:46.120 --> 2:33:50.800]  who you know I've had my arguments with but I don't try and prevent him from
[2:33:50.800 --> 2:33:55.360]  exercising his first amendment rights but and Tifa does because they're the
[2:33:55.360 --> 2:33:58.520]  actual fascists this is out of information liberation alt-right and
[2:33:58.520 --> 2:34:02.480]  Tifa battle at Auburn University after court rules Richard Spencer must be
[2:34:02.480 --> 2:34:07.760]  allowed to speak so he won the right to speak whether you disagree with him
[2:34:07.760 --> 2:34:12.240]  vehemently or not he has that right to speak they had a massive fight you can
[2:34:12.240 --> 2:34:17.200]  see the video here the difference is the police actually did their
[2:34:17.200 --> 2:34:21.640]  job unlike in Berkeley where they sat back and did nothing and in a few
[2:34:21.640 --> 2:34:25.560]  seconds here the police rush in and arrest these two individuals so they
[2:34:25.560 --> 2:34:30.000]  actually did their job in breaking up the fight if you go to the other video
[2:34:30.000 --> 2:34:36.360]  which was filmed just before this event it shows the police ordering and Tifa
[2:34:36.360 --> 2:34:41.200]  agitators to remove their masks and we got that video ready we can go to that
[2:34:41.200 --> 2:34:55.640]  because the the audio is interesting as well let's turn the audio so they're
[2:34:55.640 --> 2:35:00.880]  telling them no masks no hoodies they're actually ordering the antifa
[2:35:00.880 --> 2:35:06.800]  thugs to reveal their identities God forbid we know they don't want to reveal
[2:35:06.800 --> 2:35:11.880]  our at their identities because they're there to commit criminal actions so
[2:35:11.880 --> 2:35:16.480]  basically all of these antifa people had to reveal their identities before this
[2:35:16.480 --> 2:35:21.520]  bigger squabble there at Auburn University and the police actually broke
[2:35:21.520 --> 2:35:25.960]  up the fight some like in Berkeley where they did absolutely nothing we're
[2:35:25.960 --> 2:35:31.840]  gonna go to Mike Cernovich now he is ready and waiting in the wings Mike you
[2:35:31.840 --> 2:35:37.200]  were you were in Austin recently you went to Dallas what's the latest yeah we
[2:35:37.200 --> 2:35:42.560]  had a good time so the latest of course would be that Google did admit that
[2:35:42.560 --> 2:35:46.600]  they're calling it a rogue vendor had been manipulating infor more so how
[2:35:46.600 --> 2:35:51.840]  exciting that we got Google to respond to us within what 12 hours they they
[2:35:51.840 --> 2:35:55.760]  changed course what what a great victory you are on the show to talk about it and
[2:35:55.760 --> 2:35:59.400]  like you said within hours this was Google and their contractors are
[2:35:59.400 --> 2:36:05.080]  conspiring to de-list to relegate infowars search results in there you
[2:36:05.080 --> 2:36:08.320]  know in their algorithm they were burying them within about six hours of
[2:36:08.320 --> 2:36:12.400]  that story coming out and you talking about it on this show on Monday they
[2:36:12.400 --> 2:36:16.200]  had to publicly say they're not gonna do that anymore that is a huge victory
[2:36:16.200 --> 2:36:20.800]  right yeah it was a massive victory especially because a lot of people
[2:36:20.800 --> 2:36:24.480]  claimed that we didn't know we were talking about we actually we got a lot
[2:36:24.480 --> 2:36:28.520]  of hate for that story people said oh you don't know Google that isn't how it
[2:36:28.520 --> 2:36:33.000]  works they don't actually have contractors this is fake news yet again
[2:36:33.000 --> 2:36:38.960]  news that is broken on Alex Jones show broken on my medium is confirmed to be
[2:36:38.960 --> 2:36:42.880]  true even though the fake news media will always initially deny it it's almost
[2:36:42.880 --> 2:36:47.080]  like there's a pattern going on his there well you could suggest that it's
[2:36:47.080 --> 2:36:51.200]  definitely seems to be what's taking place Bill O'Reilly you've been tweeting
[2:36:51.200 --> 2:36:55.320]  about this basically we're expecting an announcement that he will be caught from
[2:36:55.320 --> 2:37:01.440]  Fox News we've had a media matters campaign to target his advertisers it
[2:37:01.440 --> 2:37:05.120]  appears they've been successful what's your take on Bill O'Reilly's this been
[2:37:05.120 --> 2:37:08.960]  coming for a long while correct yeah he's been going strong for a long time
[2:37:08.960 --> 2:37:15.280]  Bill O'Reilly is not really the message that I like personally so I'm not
[2:37:15.280 --> 2:37:20.280]  shedding it I don't like it they got the scalp obviously but Bill O'Reilly is
[2:37:20.280 --> 2:37:24.920]  outdated anyway people want a new message I hope Tucker Carlson takes over that
[2:37:24.920 --> 2:37:29.800]  time slot Tucker Carlson is definitely more in tune with the times than Bill
[2:37:29.800 --> 2:37:34.280]  O'Reilly so I look forward to having Tucker Carlson get that prime time slot
[2:37:34.280 --> 2:37:39.240]  cuz Tucker Carlson has the number one shot you know Bill O'Reilly never he
[2:37:39.240 --> 2:37:43.120]  never got this new movement right he's never tried to get people like you on a
[2:37:43.120 --> 2:37:47.000]  show he's never tried to get people like Stefan Molenio on a show he's never
[2:37:47.000 --> 2:37:50.440]  been in touch with any of the issues going on like online censorship Google
[2:37:50.440 --> 2:37:55.320]  SEO like Bill O'Reilly they never would have broken the story about Google
[2:37:55.320 --> 2:37:59.240]  manipulating a search results on the O'Reilly factor so I know a lot of people
[2:37:59.240 --> 2:38:03.200]  like him so I'm not throwing shade on Bill O'Reilly but me personally I don't
[2:38:03.200 --> 2:38:08.040]  view it as a big loss for him to lose that TV show and you know Fox News as
[2:38:08.040 --> 2:38:12.720]  average viewing audience in prime time is 69 years old now we're not bashing
[2:38:12.720 --> 2:38:17.160]  old people but you cannot maintain that as an audience when it's literally dying
[2:38:17.160 --> 2:38:21.400]  out like you said you know he was still the top dog on Fox News four million
[2:38:21.400 --> 2:38:25.200]  viewers a night but you can imagine somebody with a bit more energy a bit
[2:38:25.200 --> 2:38:29.120]  more cutting-edge a bit more on top of the issues like Tucker Carlson could take
[2:38:29.120 --> 2:38:35.280]  that on even further well yeah Paul the great is doing you know one million five
[2:38:35.280 --> 2:38:40.600]  million views so you know your YouTube is as big you know Jake Taper just had a
[2:38:40.600 --> 2:38:45.600]  big puff piece on him on GQ oh my god Jake Taper has arrived look at these
[2:38:45.600 --> 2:38:50.920]  cable news people your YouTube is actually doing better ratings than almost
[2:38:50.920 --> 2:38:55.240]  anybody on cable news which really shows you how out of touch these big
[2:38:55.240 --> 2:38:59.960]  networks are people want even people who are older which is great a lot of older
[2:38:59.960 --> 2:39:03.640]  people listening are listening now watching now I welcome everybody of all
[2:39:03.640 --> 2:39:07.520]  ages and I'm I'm really glad to have enthusiasm from all the people but it
[2:39:07.520 --> 2:39:12.480]  goes to show that there are a lot of people who want younger cutting-edge
[2:39:12.480 --> 2:39:17.080]  content fresher content what is really going on in the world Bill Riley never
[2:39:17.080 --> 2:39:20.600]  really told people what was really going on the world I tried to watch it a few
[2:39:20.600 --> 2:39:24.960]  times and I never left their feeling that I had been educated about a subject I
[2:39:24.960 --> 2:39:30.960]  found it boring and bland people want a fresher message exactly now I want to
[2:39:30.960 --> 2:39:33.720]  get into this Fresno thing which occurred yesterday of course you've been
[2:39:33.720 --> 2:39:40.800]  tweeting about it three victims he was a militant social justice warrior shouted
[2:39:40.800 --> 2:39:45.480]  Allah Akbar after he gunned down these people the narrative was put pretty clear
[2:39:45.480 --> 2:39:48.960]  it's going to be hard for CNN and Buzzfeed to spin this one yet they
[2:39:48.960 --> 2:39:53.920]  still tried Mike when is the mainstream media going to take responsibility for
[2:39:53.920 --> 2:39:59.960]  its violent rhetoric radicalizing people to carry out murder on the streets of
[2:39:59.960 --> 2:40:04.760]  America we saw it in Dallas with the Black Lives Matter supporter gunning
[2:40:04.760 --> 2:40:08.760]  down those police officers they tried to bomb the Ferguson police station we've
[2:40:08.760 --> 2:40:13.400]  seen it over and over again when is the MSM going to take responsibility for
[2:40:13.400 --> 2:40:18.360]  that fringe extremist rhetoric well in the young Turks also I don't know if
[2:40:18.360 --> 2:40:22.640]  somebody in the production can pull up the medium comm article I wrote the
[2:40:22.640 --> 2:40:27.200]  young Turks has now inspired multiple mass shootings this latest domestic
[2:40:27.200 --> 2:40:31.080]  terrorist was a big fan of the young Turks Elliot Roger the true the VISTA
[2:40:31.080 --> 2:40:35.280]  shooter was a big fan of the young Turks the Seattle all shooter was a big fan
[2:40:35.280 --> 2:40:40.320]  of the young Turks so the question is when will the young Turks disavow this
[2:40:40.320 --> 2:40:44.920]  violence that they seem to be inciting that yeah mass murder Elliot Roger we
[2:40:44.920 --> 2:40:48.640]  when you go through their social media you find out that people who are
[2:40:48.640 --> 2:40:53.200]  actually committing murder committing all these crimes they are big fans of the
[2:40:53.200 --> 2:40:57.320]  young Turks so how is it that the media I mean could you imagine if one of your
[2:40:57.320 --> 2:41:01.640]  fans is somebody who followed you on Twitter me or Alex or somebody if one of
[2:41:01.640 --> 2:41:05.800]  our guys you know blows spit in the wrong direction it's like a shooting
[2:41:05.800 --> 2:41:10.460]  story big headlines but I have not seen the young Turks disavow these mass
[2:41:10.460 --> 2:41:15.080]  shooters committed by their fan base I want to know why CNN isn't demanding
[2:41:15.080 --> 2:41:18.520]  with the microphones in their faces Hillary Clinton disavow this Bernie
[2:41:18.520 --> 2:41:22.040]  Sanders you disavow this Obama do you disavow this Jay Taper do you
[2:41:22.040 --> 2:41:27.560]  savow this the truth is that all of us everybody listening everybody watching
[2:41:27.560 --> 2:41:32.840]  the media wants us to be killed this is not the actress this is not hyperbole
[2:41:32.840 --> 2:41:37.520]  they want us murdered that is why they refused to cover the violence the
[2:41:37.520 --> 2:41:41.480]  long-standing violence that has been happening at Trump rallies by the
[2:41:41.480 --> 2:41:47.000]  rioters not by the Trump people this latest attack this man he said Allah
[2:41:47.000 --> 2:41:52.480]  Akbar the AP goes he said God is great and then after we all really blew him
[2:41:52.480 --> 2:41:57.280]  up look the AP all day on social media they had to admit that they were lying
[2:41:57.280 --> 2:42:00.480]  he did not say God is great he was a domestic terrorist he was also a member
[2:42:00.480 --> 2:42:05.320]  of Black Lives Matter we need to see the young Turks disavow this I mean look
[2:42:05.320 --> 2:42:08.720]  what happened with Petergate thankfully no one died you had one guy going with
[2:42:08.720 --> 2:42:14.080]  the gun and still months later it's our fault where on the rack for that simply
[2:42:14.080 --> 2:42:18.600]  for talking about the issue of Petergate this guy goes on a rampage you go on
[2:42:18.600 --> 2:42:24.000]  his Facebook page black militant groups social justice warrior groups Sean King
[2:42:24.000 --> 2:42:28.840]  BLM leader he was a fan of him as he said and all these other groups young
[2:42:28.840 --> 2:42:32.920]  Turks in every single case with these with a lot of these mass shooters young
[2:42:32.920 --> 2:42:37.280]  Turks they never have to disavow it then you have this narrative Mike which we
[2:42:37.280 --> 2:42:41.400]  see almost every day on Twitter oh by the way the the guy who's gone down the
[2:42:41.400 --> 2:42:45.440]  Dallas cops he also described him as a hero he made a video saying he was going
[2:42:45.440 --> 2:42:49.880]  to take out vengeance on America he posted things on Facebook saying Bannon
[2:42:49.880 --> 2:42:55.720]  was a white devil anti-trump means etc etc you had a guy I still can't get over
[2:42:55.720 --> 2:43:02.080]  this last year who tried to assassinate Donald Trump a British guy what happened
[2:43:02.080 --> 2:43:06.320]  to that story they made puff pieces documentaries saying he was just a
[2:43:06.320 --> 2:43:11.200]  misunderstood young kid can you imagine if somebody tried to assassinate Hillary
[2:43:11.200 --> 2:43:16.400]  Clinton a Trump supporter at her rally they would have absolutely been besides
[2:43:16.400 --> 2:43:20.840]  themselves yeah and this goes back decades your people probably remember
[2:43:20.840 --> 2:43:26.240]  the story where a black supremacist had stood outside a polling station in
[2:43:26.240 --> 2:43:30.360]  Philadelphia and they were a very militant group the Department of Justice
[2:43:30.360 --> 2:43:35.960]  had prosecuted them for voter intimidation Barack Obama told them
[2:43:35.960 --> 2:43:40.200]  dismissed the case after they had won the case you guys can pull this up in
[2:43:40.200 --> 2:43:44.320]  fact check in real time so there was a black panthers member who was screaming
[2:43:44.320 --> 2:43:48.040]  that they wanted to kill white babies they wanted to murder white people the
[2:43:48.040 --> 2:43:51.560]  Department of Justice obtained a restraining order against them they won
[2:43:51.560 --> 2:43:55.880]  the case once Obama got an office he goes no you have to leave these people
[2:43:55.880 --> 2:44:00.680]  alone he refused it that should have been a big story so this terrorism the
[2:44:00.680 --> 2:44:05.440]  domestic terrorism from these racist groups they're like the KKK now the
[2:44:05.440 --> 2:44:10.040]  black lives matter the KKK is really hard to see much of a difference between
[2:44:10.040 --> 2:44:14.400]  them given all the violence that is coming out of there they are given a
[2:44:14.400 --> 2:44:18.800]  pass remember that fellow who jumped the stage I think it was an Ohio Thomas
[2:44:18.800 --> 2:44:24.840]  Damasio he'd written on Twitter I want to be a martyr he had posted a gun icon
[2:44:24.840 --> 2:44:29.040]  and Trump and said I want to be a martyr I want to kill Trump he went and jumped
[2:44:29.040 --> 2:44:36.840]  on the stage well he went from assassination attempt on Trump to CNN
[2:44:36.840 --> 2:44:40.160]  interviewed him like he was some kind of a protester even though a search of a
[2:44:40.160 --> 2:44:44.920]  social media he had said I quote I want to be a martyr that the media really
[2:44:44.920 --> 2:44:48.840]  does want to incite and encourage these people they're basically saying if you
[2:44:48.840 --> 2:44:52.200]  murder people like Alex Jones at Paul Watson and Mike Senator Richard Donald
[2:44:52.200 --> 2:44:56.640]  Trump we will make you famous and we'll make y'all to be a hero on a martyr that's
[2:44:56.640 --> 2:45:00.240]  the point they incentivize it this is the point I've made over and over the
[2:45:00.240 --> 2:45:04.360]  right disavows its fringe extremists okay we're not denying that there are far
[2:45:04.360 --> 2:45:07.400]  right racists who go out and kill people in fact it happened in New York there
[2:45:07.400 --> 2:45:11.460]  was the guy who went to New York to kill black people that was horrible we
[2:45:11.460 --> 2:45:15.720]  disavowed it said it was despicable what happened yesterday after this Fresno
[2:45:15.720 --> 2:45:19.880]  thing Mike they were out on Twitter saying that it was bots pushing it to the
[2:45:19.880 --> 2:45:24.280]  top of Twitter trending it was a breaking news story multiple victim
[2:45:24.280 --> 2:45:28.440]  shooting obviously it was a huge issue and they come out and say bots they
[2:45:28.440 --> 2:45:33.600]  embrace and encourage and incentivize extremism we disavow it but where where
[2:45:33.600 --> 2:45:39.240]  the evil right wing racist right yeah exactly so if people throw up a Nazi
[2:45:39.240 --> 2:45:43.240]  salute which is a dumb thing to do anyway I'm not going to defend that but the
[2:45:43.240 --> 2:45:47.480]  media freaks out oh my god these people throw up a Nazi salute can you believe
[2:45:47.480 --> 2:45:52.200]  it you guys better disavow it Trump you better disavow it and that's dumb I
[2:45:52.200 --> 2:45:55.160]  don't encourage that I don't want people doing that kind of stuff it doesn't move
[2:45:55.160 --> 2:45:59.280]  the ball downfield in any way and there's no reason to do that kind of
[2:45:59.280 --> 2:46:05.560]  stuff that said that is the worst that they can find people doing on the right
[2:46:05.560 --> 2:46:10.920]  is trying to be offensive on the left there have been multiple mass shootings
[2:46:10.920 --> 2:46:14.760]  the young Turks have inspired multiple mass shootings the Seattle mall
[2:46:14.760 --> 2:46:19.240]  shooting Elliot Roger there was another shooting that I can't remember the
[2:46:19.240 --> 2:46:23.880]  Southern Poverty Law Center talk about ironic the Southern Poverty Law Center
[2:46:23.880 --> 2:46:27.840]  tracks all these groups on their hate watch list but you can look up the
[2:46:27.840 --> 2:46:33.040]  Family Research Council shooting Floyd Lee Corkins went into the family
[2:46:33.040 --> 2:46:36.800]  Research Council and attempted to murder a bunch of people he was
[2:46:36.800 --> 2:46:41.640]  fortunately stopped because the by a guard right he'd been top he'd been
[2:46:41.640 --> 2:46:46.000]  stopped and they go why did you do this for the Corkins he said I went on the
[2:46:46.000 --> 2:46:51.320]  Southern Poverty Lawsons hate watch list and that's how he chose his target and I
[2:46:51.320 --> 2:46:55.560]  go so why aren't there more stories about the Southern Poverty Law Center a
[2:46:55.560 --> 2:47:00.120]  shooter for the Corkins where's the media outrage on that how can the Southern
[2:47:00.120 --> 2:47:05.120]  Poverty Law Center which inspires mass shootings pretend to track hate they
[2:47:05.120 --> 2:47:08.360]  are actually the hate group yes the Southern Poverty Law Center inspired
[2:47:08.360 --> 2:47:13.560]  for the Corkins he went in and he even said I went in to commit murder
[2:47:13.560 --> 2:47:17.040]  multiple people because the Southern Poverty Law Center's website
[2:47:17.040 --> 2:47:21.560]  essentially inspired him to do it most people have never even heard of that
[2:47:21.560 --> 2:47:26.800]  story most people have never heard of it because the media covered it up also
[2:47:26.800 --> 2:47:30.360]  Ishmael Brinsley you had he killed two cops in New York I think it was
[2:47:30.360 --> 2:47:35.440]  December 2015 shot them in the head at point blank range black lives matter
[2:47:35.440 --> 2:47:40.720]  revenge attack they found his documents they found the motivation behind it that
[2:47:40.720 --> 2:47:45.400]  story disappeared within a couple of days you can look at Ferguson they
[2:47:45.400 --> 2:47:50.560]  plotted to bomb the Ferguson police station the Dallas sniper attack the
[2:47:50.560 --> 2:47:56.160]  Baton Rouge attack every single example radicalized by this Trump derangement
[2:47:56.160 --> 2:48:00.520]  syndrome rhetoric this anti-white sentiment which Twitter people on Twitter
[2:48:00.520 --> 2:48:04.520]  leftist social justice warriors have tried to turn into a trendy meme you
[2:48:04.520 --> 2:48:08.680]  know they say oh have good morning except white people they've turned that
[2:48:08.680 --> 2:48:14.280]  into a meme BuzzFeed pushes it MTV pushes it now dangerous people on the
[2:48:14.280 --> 2:48:18.960]  edge on the fringes are starting to violently act out on it yeah they even
[2:48:18.960 --> 2:48:23.680]  started hashtag called kill all white men which Twitter allowed a trend right
[2:48:23.680 --> 2:48:30.440]  we couldn't turn anything anymore they may only go in and edit it but they
[2:48:30.440 --> 2:48:35.520]  let the kill all white men hashtag trend and of course nobody who wants to
[2:48:35.520 --> 2:48:39.560]  advocate for the genocide of white people you don't get banned on Twitter
[2:48:39.560 --> 2:48:44.440]  for that absolutely incredible switching gears a little bit we had Chris Evans the
[2:48:44.440 --> 2:48:49.720]  actor I think he played captain America he says Mike that he wants to run into
[2:48:49.720 --> 2:48:54.600]  the guy who punched the antifa girl at Berkeley the girl with the dreadlocks do
[2:48:54.600 --> 2:48:58.840]  you think that Chris Evans what would he do if he ran into the dozens of
[2:48:58.840 --> 2:49:03.720]  antifa scum who threw rocks and threw bottles at Trump supporters do you
[2:49:03.720 --> 2:49:07.520]  think he'd be interested in confronting those people or does he just want to
[2:49:07.520 --> 2:49:12.600]  virtue signal about it on Twitter well I would love for Chris Evans to attend a
[2:49:12.600 --> 2:49:16.240]  event where antifa are there because they will smash his head with a brick
[2:49:16.240 --> 2:49:21.000]  my advice to Chris Evans mr. Virtue signalers why don't you go show up to
[2:49:21.000 --> 2:49:24.400]  some antifa people and if they don't know that you're famous you're just
[2:49:24.400 --> 2:49:28.560]  going to be another straight white man they will smash you in the head with a
[2:49:28.560 --> 2:49:34.200]  bat so please Chris Evans go hang out with this antifa trash I encourage it I
[2:49:34.200 --> 2:49:39.400]  want to see what happens when you and antifa are in the same room okay final
[2:49:39.400 --> 2:49:42.520]  minute Mike just tell us what's coming up what's on your radar for the next
[2:49:42.520 --> 2:49:47.240]  week or so okay so I broke another big story that hasn't really taken off yet
[2:49:47.240 --> 2:49:51.640]  there is now an official policy and I found out this goes up to the governor
[2:49:51.640 --> 2:49:57.800]  Jerry Brown where if you're a violent felon but you could be deported they
[2:49:57.800 --> 2:50:01.680]  will plead down your violent felon case to a misdemeanor so if they can pull up
[2:50:01.680 --> 2:50:06.960]  that medium article the Santa Clara prosecutor Jeff Rose and now his whole
[2:50:06.960 --> 2:50:12.320]  people that even if you beat up a woman smash her face in if you could be
[2:50:12.320 --> 2:50:17.120]  deported if you're convicted of a hell of felony then they will actually reduce
[2:50:17.120 --> 2:50:22.000]  the charge against you so we now and I've heard now that this comes from Jerry
[2:50:22.000 --> 2:50:26.760]  Brown so this comes from the governor this is all of California is now in a
[2:50:26.760 --> 2:50:30.760]  very very dangerous precarious situation because they're committing
[2:50:30.760 --> 2:50:34.960]  activism to try to keep violent criminals in the country you can't make this up
[2:50:34.960 --> 2:50:39.080]  I emailed the spokespeople they told me I'm right I'm gonna update the story but
[2:50:39.080 --> 2:50:42.640]  you can see this is all verified this is all fact-checked that they are
[2:50:42.640 --> 2:50:47.040]  literally saying that we don't care if you're murdered we're gonna put the
[2:50:47.040 --> 2:50:50.640]  rights of violent criminal immigrants ahead of the rights of law-abiding

[2:57:21.680 --> 2:57:24.800]  strike group the Donald Trump administration is causing a stir for a
[2:57:24.800 --> 2:57:29.520]  false narrative intended or not that US Navy strike group led by the nuclear
[2:57:29.520 --> 2:57:33.360]  powered aircraft carrier USS Carl Vincent was ordered to waters off the Korean
[2:57:33.360 --> 2:57:38.840]  Peninsula from Singapore on April 8th so you heard that that are Marder as
[2:57:38.840 --> 2:57:43.080]  Trump called it was sailing towards the Korean Peninsula to send a strong
[2:57:43.080 --> 2:57:47.200]  message to North Korea given that many people feared they were about to conduct
[2:57:47.200 --> 2:57:52.160]  a six nuclear test actually turns out that it never even went there it is
[2:57:52.160 --> 2:57:56.720]  scheduled to go there at the end of this month but it was actually sent to the
[2:57:56.720 --> 2:58:02.560]  Indian Ocean to take part in a scheduled exercise with Australian forces so it
[2:58:02.560 --> 2:58:07.720]  actually sailed in the opposite direction it was a complete hoax that it was
[2:58:07.720 --> 2:58:12.320]  even heading towards the Korean Peninsula at this time they are saying it
[2:58:12.320 --> 2:58:16.440]  will head there at the end of the month we will wait and see on that North

[3:00:16.400 --> 3:00:29.600]  it's alex jones we are back on the alex jones shows going through a few final
[3:00:29.600 --> 3:00:35.440]  global news stories North Korea war fears are building once again as Kim
[3:00:35.440 --> 3:00:41.960]  Jong-un primed to fire nuke on this date what is the day it's April 25th next
[3:00:41.960 --> 3:00:46.080]  Tuesday Pyongyang is continuing to talk up his ambitions for a nuclear weapon
[3:00:46.080 --> 3:00:50.480]  capable of striking the US mainland experts say that's a few years away but
[3:00:50.480 --> 3:00:55.200]  Kim was humiliated when his latest missile launch failed and intentions with
[3:00:55.200 --> 3:00:58.680]  US president Donald Trump of course we had speculation was it cyber attack
[3:00:58.680 --> 3:01:03.920]  cyber hacked probably was the case now North Korea is expected to double down
[3:01:03.920 --> 3:01:10.680]  and prime a nuclear bomb test within the week the six nuclear bomb test of
[3:01:10.680 --> 3:01:15.120]  course Trump administration has made noises that that could prompt an all-out
[3:01:15.120 --> 3:01:19.720]  attack on North Korea which could launch a conflict a regional conflict in
[3:01:19.720 --> 3:01:24.240]  that region North Korea would then attack South Korea and Japan millions of
[3:01:24.240 --> 3:01:29.640]  people could die we're still on the precipice of that now they're speculating
[3:01:29.640 --> 3:01:35.000]  Pyongyang is thought to be plotting to attempt a nuclear bomb test on April 25th
[3:01:35.000 --> 3:01:40.520]  next Tuesday to coincide with military foundation day so that could be the
[3:01:40.520 --> 3:01:44.880]  flashpoint hopefully we don't see tensions escalate but it remains to be
[3:01:44.880 --> 3:01:50.480]  seen Breitbart reports out of Germany Turkish migrants sedated raped 53 year
[3:01:50.480 --> 3:01:55.560]  old hospital hospital patient in his care a 58 year old Turkish migrant working
[3:01:55.560 --> 3:01:59.360]  as a nursing assistant at a hospital in Germany reportedly sedated and raped a
[3:01:59.360 --> 3:02:03.920]  53 year old female patient in his care absolute massive problems with the
[3:02:03.920 --> 3:02:07.200]  integration there of course Merkel has flipped flops over and over again
[3:02:07.200 --> 3:02:12.040]  they're still bringing in the migrants via the taxi service being run by the
[3:02:12.040 --> 3:02:17.560]  EU and NGOs what's also happening up in Calais France of course we had the Calais
[3:02:17.560 --> 3:02:23.000]  migrant camps supposedly demolished by French authorities now those migrants
[3:02:23.000 --> 3:02:28.000]  are returning because these left-wing groups these NGOs are returning to Calais
[3:02:28.000 --> 3:02:33.160]  themselves setting up food stalls attracting these migrants back to Calais
[3:02:33.160 --> 3:02:37.560]  no women and children there these are men mainly from West Africa they're not
[3:02:37.560 --> 3:02:42.400]  refugees they're economic migrants these NGOs these leftists who have helped them
[3:02:42.400 --> 3:02:47.640]  break the law in many cases are helping them return to Calais they see out the
[3:02:47.640 --> 3:02:51.520]  telegraph hundreds of migrants back in Calais weeks after jungle camp torn down
[3:02:51.520 --> 3:02:57.480]  the problems are only going to continue they're still trying to hijack trucks
[3:02:57.480 --> 3:03:02.600]  lorries to get into England because of our generous welfare system you've seen
[3:03:02.600 --> 3:03:07.760]  the chaos that has caused with attacks on motorists now because of these left
[3:03:07.760 --> 3:03:12.920]  wing do good as social justice warriors handing out free food they're all
[3:03:12.920 --> 3:03:17.520]  returning and it's only gonna cause more danger to the migrants themselves but
[3:03:17.520 --> 3:03:21.120]  again no women and children when you see those pictures amongst them we've
[3:03:21.120 --> 3:03:24.440]  visited the migrant camps again the narrative they're selling is is
[3:03:24.440 --> 3:03:31.120]  completely fraudulent RT reports US Aussie Advisors Court in ISIS chemical attack
[3:03:31.120 --> 3:03:35.560]  against Iraqi troops in Mosul the Iraqi unit targeted on Sunday in a chemical
[3:03:35.560 --> 3:03:38.760]  weapons attack in Mosul was hosting embedded foreign military specialists
[3:03:38.760 --> 3:03:45.280]  they were attacked with chemical weapons by ISIS proving once again that it's not
[3:03:45.280 --> 3:03:49.520]  just President Bashar al-Assad that has chemical weapons even though they
[3:03:49.520 --> 3:03:56.200]  supposedly disarmed him of those chemical weapons back in 2013 now US and
[3:03:56.200 --> 3:04:00.680]  Aussie Advisors over there in the region have been victims of chemical chemical
[3:04:00.680 --> 3:04:04.720]  attacks launched by ISIS we've seen past stories where they're handed the
[3:04:04.720 --> 3:04:09.840]  weapons by Saudi Arabia mishandled them they explode and then Assad gets

[3:04:38.760 --> 3:04:44.360]  a dime and with no vote whatsoever in Parliament the UK could support a US

[3:05:22.560 --> 3:05:27.520]  notice a meme he posted recently about White House chief strategist Steve

[3:08:54.440 --> 3:08:59.960]  great lineup today with my friend Paul Joseph Watson leading the choir and
[3:08:59.960 --> 3:09:05.160]  breaking a lot of important news there's been a lot of discussion today about the
[3:09:05.160 --> 3:09:10.240]  issue of internet censorship and the efforts to crack down by Google and
[3:09:10.240 --> 3:09:17.720]  Facebook and Apple and others that's why gabb the new application the new
[3:09:17.720 --> 3:09:24.960]  social media phenomena is so important conservatives Liberty-minded folks need
[3:09:24.960 --> 3:09:34.080]  to sign up on gabb I'm a proud participant there I enjoy it and now
[3:09:34.080 --> 3:09:39.840]  that I see Twitter beginning to censor my Twitter my tweets I see Facebook
[3:09:39.840 --> 3:09:45.640]  censoring my posts it's all the more important that we have an alternative
[3:09:45.640 --> 3:09:52.080]  and gabb is moving quickly to fill that void so folks go there sign up and join
[3:09:52.080 --> 3:09:57.400]  the new revolution that's afoot there what really concerns me more about this
[3:09:57.400 --> 3:10:01.880]  issue is that there's no evidence whatsoever that the Trump White House is
[3:10:01.880 --> 3:10:08.920]  aware of this massive effort to censor and in fact disenfranchise the very
[3:10:08.920 --> 3:10:16.080]  Trump constituency that won this election is the Trump White House or the
[3:10:16.080 --> 3:10:23.080]  Trump Justice Department aware of the antitrust aspects of the monopoly being
[3:10:23.080 --> 3:10:31.080]  waged by Google by Facebook and others what of the meeting that we've learned
[3:10:31.080 --> 3:10:37.280]  about between Apple CEO who was spot dining with Jared Kushner and Ivanka
[3:10:37.280 --> 3:10:44.720]  Trump back in January to me this signals that the Trump White House is not
[3:10:44.720 --> 3:10:50.160]  aware of the fact that there are those in Silicon Valley who seek to strangle
[3:10:50.160 --> 3:10:58.320]  the Trump constituency they seemingly are unaware of the efforts to silence
[3:10:58.320 --> 3:11:05.720]  those responsible for the election of Donald Trump if the there is no
[3:11:05.720 --> 3:11:12.960]  antitrust effort by the Trump Justice Department if there is no successful
[3:11:12.960 --> 3:11:24.000]  class action suit if the tech left giants are allowed to impose Joseph Stalin
[3:11:24.000 --> 3:11:30.520]  like censorship well then the prospects for Donald Trump's reelection will be
[3:11:30.520 --> 3:11:37.440]  zero yet there seems to be an unawareness in the Trump White House of
[3:11:37.440 --> 3:11:43.080]  the significance of this issue and the significance that it bears for the
[3:11:43.080 --> 3:11:49.760]  future of the entire Trump reform movement now one would have thought that
[3:11:49.760 --> 3:11:57.280]  my friend Steve Bannon who comes from alternative media who was the proud
[3:11:57.280 --> 3:12:04.480]  publisher of Breitbart.com and who really was on the cutting edge of the
[3:12:04.480 --> 3:12:10.240]  effort to break the mainstream media monopoly the stranglehold that they had
[3:12:10.240 --> 3:12:15.000]  on the dissemination of political information prior to this presidential
[3:12:15.000 --> 3:12:19.560]  election one would have thought that mr. Bannon would have made this issue front
[3:12:19.560 --> 3:12:26.000]  and center in the Trump White House but there is today no evidence that that has
[3:12:26.000 --> 3:12:30.560]  happened in the next segment we're going to talk about the White House
[3:12:30.560 --> 3:12:35.480]  counter-tempts and what's going on internally and the furious jockeying
[3:12:35.480 --> 3:12:43.320]  going on among Trump aides for the future of the Trump legacy will this be a
[3:12:43.320 --> 3:12:49.000]  transformational presidency that we have been promised or will it be simply
[3:12:49.000 --> 3:12:56.560]  transitional will the president employ aides who will carry out the vision
[3:12:56.560 --> 3:13:02.400]  that he outlined in the selection campaign or will he be co-opted into
[3:13:02.400 --> 3:13:10.240]  being yet another establishment president I have grave concerns that
[3:13:10.240 --> 3:13:15.640]  there are many aboard the White House staff who are really not serving this
[3:13:15.640 --> 3:13:22.520]  president well who don't understand his vision you see in my experience over 40
[3:13:22.520 --> 3:13:27.560]  years as a friend and associate of Donald Trump I can tell you that when he
[3:13:27.560 --> 3:13:34.720]  has all of the information he almost invariably makes the right decisions his
[3:13:34.720 --> 3:13:40.600]  instincts are near perfect he abhors globalism he believes in American
[3:13:40.600 --> 3:13:48.520]  exceptionalism he understands the effort to move us towards away from
[3:13:48.520 --> 3:13:56.440]  American sovereignty and into a world government and he's opposed so as I say
[3:13:56.440 --> 3:14:02.800]  when he has all the facts he makes good decisions I have absolute confidence in
[3:14:02.800 --> 3:14:08.440]  the thought process and the fundamental principles that I know Donald Trump
[3:14:08.440 --> 3:14:13.960]  shares with so many of the info where his watchers the question is does he
[3:14:13.960 --> 3:14:21.560]  understand the great challenge that is posed by this effort to censor his
[3:14:21.560 --> 3:14:28.000]  supporters this is something that I intend to focus on very aggressively in
[3:14:28.000 --> 3:14:34.240]  the months ahead it's vitally important to understand that the those who are
[3:14:34.240 --> 3:14:39.560]  talking about net freedom those who are talking about net neutrality those on the
[3:14:39.560 --> 3:14:46.080]  left that's not what they're for this is a wolf in sheep's clothing we are the
[3:14:46.080 --> 3:14:52.800]  ones who favor free and total access to the net we are the ones who are for net
[3:14:52.800 --> 3:14:59.120]  neutrality we are the ones who oppose the giant internet companies selling and
[3:14:59.120 --> 3:15:07.040]  and sifting through our data and I am convinced that once the president does
[3:15:07.040 --> 3:15:12.080]  understand the important communications issues that are involved well then
[3:15:12.080 --> 3:15:18.840]  perhaps then the the Jeff Sessions Justice Department will pursue the kind
[3:15:18.840 --> 3:15:25.680]  of antitrust that is appropriate in this kind of situation you see we have laws
[3:15:25.680 --> 3:15:34.320]  to protect the the average person in these situations and it's time to apply
[3:15:34.320 --> 3:15:40.840]  them some of you may know that there is an internal struggle in the Trump
[3:15:40.840 --> 3:15:49.800]  White House that that Trump economic adviser Steve Cohn who would pardon me
[3:15:49.800 --> 3:15:57.360]  Gary Cohn who would aspire to be White House chief of staff an active liberal
[3:15:57.360 --> 3:16:05.240]  Democrat a major donor to Trump opponents a former top executive at
[3:16:05.240 --> 3:16:11.200]  Goldman Sachs well he aspires to be White House chief of staff then there is
[3:16:11.200 --> 3:16:17.400]  a Dina Powell a Bushite who was a featured speaker at the Clinton Global
[3:16:17.400 --> 3:16:21.760]  Initiative conferences she most certainly didn't support Donald Trump for
[3:16:21.760 --> 3:16:25.880]  president in the last election but brought into the White House by Ivanka
[3:16:25.880 --> 3:16:33.880]  Trump she also aspires to be White House chief of staff either one of these
[3:16:33.880 --> 3:16:39.000]  appointments will result in a complete revolt at the grassroots of the Trump
[3:16:39.000 --> 3:16:44.080]  movement neither one of them understands the coalition that elected a
[3:16:44.080 --> 3:16:50.120]  Donald Trump and both believe wrongly that the success of his presidency can
[3:16:50.120 --> 3:16:56.320]  only be guaranteed by Donald Trump moving to the middle you see they would
[3:16:56.320 --> 3:17:03.320]  like President Trump to fit into the Bush Clinton Bush Obama continuum a
[3:17:03.320 --> 3:17:10.600]  mainstream president who changes nothing who continues to pursue endless war
[3:17:10.600 --> 3:17:17.840]  abroad continues to pile up massive debt and more spending will let our current
[3:17:17.840 --> 3:17:24.680]  immigration system which leaves our borders porous in place will do nothing
[3:17:24.680 --> 3:17:31.560]  about the trade deals that have sucked the jobs out of America as that great
[3:17:31.560 --> 3:17:38.920]  Texan Ross Perot said some years ago correctly about the NAFTA agreement
[3:17:38.920 --> 3:17:45.880]  which the Bush is and the Clintons working together have foisted upon us so
[3:17:45.880 --> 3:17:54.000]  the fight continues and those in the Trump supporting legions who believed
[3:17:54.000 --> 3:18:01.880]  that the the election of Donald Trump would automatically result in a sea
[3:18:01.880 --> 3:18:09.120]  change misunderstand the power of the forces both inside the White House and
[3:18:09.120 --> 3:18:15.680]  institutional Washington who remain opposed to the Trump revolution this
[3:18:15.680 --> 3:18:22.600]  fight was never going to be easy and it was never going to be quick it's
[3:18:22.600 --> 3:18:27.800]  important to note that with previous presidents like Richard Nixon like say
[3:18:27.800 --> 3:18:33.760]  Lyndon Johnson you had men who had served in the house served in the Senate but
[3:18:33.760 --> 3:18:39.320]  more importantly served as vice president having a superb perch to
[3:18:39.320 --> 3:18:46.000]  understand which are the most important appointments in Congress in the house
[3:18:46.000 --> 3:18:55.160]  and to go easy on the question of of where the real levers of power are in
[3:18:55.160 --> 3:19:00.320]  Washington Donald Trump despite the fact that he has the stature and the
[3:19:00.320 --> 3:19:07.840]  executive ability to be president has no such previous government experience
[3:19:07.840 --> 3:19:13.560]  interestingly enough the same criticism of disorganization was leveled first at
[3:19:13.560 --> 3:19:20.960]  Jimmy Carter and later at Bill Clinton two outsiders at least outside from the
[3:19:20.960 --> 3:19:24.320]  sense that they weren't from the Washington political system they had
[3:19:24.320 --> 3:19:30.600]  both been governors of small southern states they received the same kind of
[3:19:30.600 --> 3:19:38.360]  criticism about the early days of their administration now there is no question
[3:19:38.360 --> 3:19:44.640]  that Donald Trump is finally getting a handle on what is transpiring in Washington
[3:19:44.640 --> 3:19:50.000]  but he comes to this as new and therefore when those say what would you tell
[3:19:50.000 --> 3:19:54.440]  the president or what would you tell those who oppose the president I would
[3:19:54.440 --> 3:20:00.280]  say give the man a chance you see he's been present the story of the shaving
[3:20:00.280 --> 3:20:05.000]  company called Harry's in an epic battle of David versus Goliath in the early
[3:20:05.000 --> 3:20:09.520]  1980s a child was born two of them actually their names were Jeff and Andy
[3:20:09.520 --> 3:20:14.600]  time went by they developed facial hair and one day something happened Andy got

[3:20:30.040 --> 3:20:33.600]  overpriced razor company respond by threatening to sue their pants off

[3:24:19.160 --> 3:24:26.000]  welcome back I'm Roger Stone New York Times best-selling author and proud to
[3:24:26.000 --> 3:24:32.360]  be here sitting in for my friend Alex Jones who's in disposed we are I want
[3:24:32.360 --> 3:24:36.560]  to go back to something we talked about in the first segment which is the
[3:24:36.560 --> 3:24:43.920]  meeting between Apple CEO Tim Cook Jared Kushner the president's son-in-law and
[3:24:43.920 --> 3:24:49.680]  Ivanka Trump the president's daughter who is a friend and a woman I admire
[3:24:49.680 --> 3:24:57.960]  very much back in January we learned that the Apple CEO Tim Cook was spotted
[3:24:57.960 --> 3:25:06.520]  having dinner DC power dinner as they call them where he was joined by Apple's
[3:25:06.520 --> 3:25:11.640]  head of policy and environment Lisa Jackson Jackson you may remember was the
[3:25:11.640 --> 3:25:17.240]  environmental protection agency administrator under Barack Obama they
[3:25:17.240 --> 3:25:22.800]  were spotted eating at Tosca a high-end Italian restaurant just a few blocks
[3:25:22.800 --> 3:25:27.960]  from the White House the dinner suggests that Apple's outreach previously
[3:25:27.960 --> 3:25:32.800]  focused on the Democratic Party is now shifted to the Trump administration
[3:25:32.800 --> 3:25:37.640]  Jackson is a particularly bad actor she was on the board of the Clinton
[3:25:37.640 --> 3:25:42.120]  Foundation and has communicated with Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John
[3:25:42.120 --> 3:25:50.360]  Podesta according to the emails that were published by WikiLeaks last year she
[3:25:50.360 --> 3:25:57.800]  also was a major fundraiser for Hillary Clinton now one wonders what the subject
[3:25:57.800 --> 3:26:03.680]  of this dinner could have been did Apple discuss their efforts to strangle
[3:26:03.680 --> 3:26:09.720]  gab that we talked about with Paul Joseph Watson only a short time ago did
[3:26:09.720 --> 3:26:16.520]  Apple talk about the efforts to censor the Trump constituency across the board
[3:26:16.520 --> 3:26:22.560]  now I think the Google and Apple outreach to the Clinton pardon me to the
[3:26:22.560 --> 3:26:29.840]  Trump administration is ominous ominous only if there is no wake-up call for the
[3:26:29.840 --> 3:26:34.840]  president and his top aides that the effort to strangle the Trump movement in
[3:26:34.840 --> 3:26:42.720]  the cradle is ongoing and that now you both utilizing the the so-called
[3:26:42.720 --> 3:26:49.400]  Ministry of Truth the National Censorship Board that was set up late in the
[3:26:49.400 --> 3:26:54.600]  Obama administration and funded with our tax dollars through a defense
[3:26:54.600 --> 3:27:02.200]  appropriation in 2016 actually gives the government the authority and the
[3:27:02.200 --> 3:27:09.600]  wherewithal to go into the net using subcontractors like snopes.com or
[3:27:09.600 --> 3:27:18.840]  factcheck.org to decide what is and is not fake news this is a slippery slope
[3:27:18.840 --> 3:27:26.600]  and will the will the Silicon Valley crowd succeed in convincing
[3:27:26.600 --> 3:27:35.560]  Donna pardon me succeed in convincing Jared and Ivanka Trump that they are
[3:27:35.560 --> 3:27:42.600]  new friends of the administration well anyone raise what these tech giants are

[3:30:03.760 --> 3:30:08.800]  kids on Easter Sunday that's right dozens of news outlets ran with a
[3:30:08.800 --> 3:30:13.360]  misleading video claiming that President Trump signed a kids make
[3:30:13.360 --> 3:30:18.400]  America great again at and then threw it away from the kid into the crowd the
[3:30:18.400 --> 3:30:22.600]  video quickly went viral racking up nearly 10,000 retweets and getting
[3:30:22.600 --> 3:30:27.680]  picked up by other news outlets the Washington Post reported Trump using a
[3:30:27.680 --> 3:30:32.040]  thick sharpie put his signature on the bill of the cap then looked up and
[3:30:32.040 --> 3:30:37.760]  lobbed it into the crowd nowhere near the hand that had given it to him Buzz
[3:30:37.760 --> 3:30:41.600]  Feet even claimed that the poor kid never got his hat back but in reality
[3:30:41.600 --> 3:30:46.360]  other camera angles clearly show the president and the kid were just having
[3:30:46.360 --> 3:30:51.400]  fun and the boy indeed caught his hat signed by the president of the United

[3:33:49.440 --> 3:33:58.000]  you will call in I want to quickly go to a video that showed on CNN a news piece
[3:33:58.000 --> 3:34:04.960]  sources the FBI used dossier allegations to bolster Trump Russia
[3:34:04.960 --> 3:34:11.120]  investigation this is important let's roll it and then I'll tell you my
[3:34:11.120 --> 3:34:17.520]  analysis and the latest on this growing scandal well both your officials tell
[3:34:17.520 --> 3:34:21.960]  CNN that last year the FBI used a dossier of allegations of Russian ties
[3:34:21.960 --> 3:34:26.040]  to Donald Trump's campaign as part of the justification to get approval to
[3:34:26.040 --> 3:34:30.760]  secretly monitor Trump associate Carter Page and those sources say that the FBI
[3:34:30.760 --> 3:34:34.680]  director James Comey has cited the dossier in some of his briefings to
[3:34:34.680 --> 3:34:38.480]  members of Congress in recent weeks as one of the sources of information that
[3:34:38.480 --> 3:34:42.960]  the Bureau used to bolster his investigation now this includes approval
[3:34:42.960 --> 3:34:46.440]  from the secret court that oversees the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act
[3:34:46.440 --> 3:34:51.400]  known as FISA to monitor pages communications to obtain permission to
[3:34:51.400 --> 3:34:54.920]  target page the FBI and the Justice Department would have to present
[3:34:54.920 --> 3:35:00.120]  probable cause that he was acting as an agent of a foreign power including
[3:35:00.120 --> 3:35:04.040]  possibly engaging in clandestine intelligence gathering for a foreign
[3:35:04.040 --> 3:35:08.240]  government. Comey and other top Justice Department officials would have
[3:35:08.240 --> 3:35:12.640]  had to sign off on that request last year Page was identified by the Trump
[3:35:12.640 --> 3:35:16.600]  campaign as an advisor on national security matters though it's said it
[3:35:16.600 --> 3:35:19.720]  has since said that he had limited interaction with the campaign as a
[3:35:19.720 --> 3:35:24.080]  volunteer. And then how surprising is it that this was even done? Well it is
[3:35:24.080 --> 3:35:28.720]  surprising because Comey's briefings to lawmakers stands in contrast to the
[3:35:28.720 --> 3:35:32.920]  efforts in recent months by the Bureau and US intelligence agencies to try to
[3:35:32.920 --> 3:35:37.320]  distance themselves from that dossier. US law enforcement and intelligence
[3:35:37.320 --> 3:35:41.920]  officials have said that US investigators did their own work separate
[3:35:41.920 --> 3:35:46.280]  from the dossier to support the findings that Russia tried to meddle in the
[3:35:46.280 --> 3:35:51.320]  2016 presidential election in favor of Donald Trump. Now our sources say that
[3:35:51.320 --> 3:35:55.680]  Comey hasn't mentioned the dossier in all of these lawmaker briefings.
[3:35:55.680 --> 3:35:59.440]  Now Carter Page himself would not be aware that this was going on right?
[3:35:59.440 --> 3:36:03.840]  That's right you'll recall that Page has been scrutinized before a 2013
[3:36:03.840 --> 3:36:08.800]  investigation of a Russian spy ring including included descriptions of
[3:36:08.800 --> 3:36:14.120]  interactions that he had with one of the alleged spies. Now Page denies that he
[3:36:14.120 --> 3:36:18.120]  knew they were Russian agents and last summer he traveled to Russia to give a
[3:36:18.120 --> 3:36:22.680]  speech highly critical of US policy on Russia. That speech actually drew the
[3:36:22.680 --> 3:36:26.400]  attention of the FBI according to US officials we've been talking to. I think
[3:36:26.400 --> 3:36:35.320]  we get the flavor of this. Let me speak to the import here. It is very clear
[3:36:35.320 --> 3:36:41.680]  that the that at least three top associates of Donald Trump were under
[3:36:41.680 --> 3:36:46.080]  surveillance. According to the New York Times on January 20th their headline
[3:36:46.080 --> 3:36:54.160]  wire-tapped data used in probe of Trump aides myself included made it very
[3:36:54.160 --> 3:37:00.440]  clear that the that the intelligence agencies claimed that they had emails
[3:37:00.440 --> 3:37:05.480]  records of financial transactions and then later on the 30th of January the
[3:37:05.480 --> 3:37:11.200]  Times reports that they also claimed to have transcripts of telephone
[3:37:11.200 --> 3:37:18.360]  intercepts that would indicate collusion between the Russian state and the
[3:37:18.360 --> 3:37:24.720]  Trump campaign. My attorneys believe on the basis of that story and information
[3:37:24.720 --> 3:37:29.600]  that appeared in several other places that I was among those whose civil
[3:37:29.600 --> 3:37:35.040]  liberties were violated whose right to privacy was thrown out the window and in
[3:37:35.040 --> 3:37:40.520]  fact is highly likely that I was under surveillance from June of last year
[3:37:40.520 --> 3:37:47.080]  until at least election day. That would mean of course that my various
[3:37:47.080 --> 3:37:52.320]  conversations with candidate Donald Trump would have been recorded and
[3:37:52.320 --> 3:37:59.920]  monitored by the government. Now there is no probable cause there is no evidence
[3:37:59.920 --> 3:38:06.560]  of collusion or even contact with the Russian state or any representative of
[3:38:06.560 --> 3:38:15.040]  those that would justify such surveillance. I have repeatedly asked the
[3:38:15.040 --> 3:38:22.320]  New York Times for some clarification of their story and I have also appealed to
[3:38:22.320 --> 3:38:28.160]  the House Intelligence Committee to clarify where where this is going and
[3:38:28.160 --> 3:38:34.480]  who else would have been under surveillance. This is a developing story. I
[3:38:34.480 --> 3:38:39.000]  think we're going to learn that the wiretapping or the surveillance at
[3:38:39.000 --> 3:38:44.120]  Trump Tower was based on the false argument that the Trump campaign was
[3:38:44.120 --> 3:38:49.760]  trafficking with the Russians. That false narrative will fall away and we're
[3:38:49.760 --> 3:38:54.880]  going to learn the surveillance was strictly for political purposes. This is
[3:38:54.880 --> 3:39:04.720]  Watergate times 10. Now I want to go to some of your calls. I am let's see pick
[3:39:04.720 --> 3:39:10.840]  one for me here gentlemen because I am without my glasses and alright let's go
[3:39:10.840 --> 3:39:14.720]  with John and Wyoming. I like that one first. John go ahead. Thank you very much
[3:39:14.720 --> 3:39:19.360]  Roger it's great to have you on the air again. You notice how the media has been
[3:39:19.360 --> 3:39:24.640]  saying for quite some time that the North Koreans are trying to develop an ICBM
[3:39:24.640 --> 3:39:29.880]  that'll reach the US yet when I had a talk show in Gillette Wyoming it was
[3:39:29.880 --> 3:39:37.680]  March of 2003 then CIA director George Tennant said the North Koreans then in
[3:39:37.680 --> 3:39:44.600]  March of 2003 had the ability to reach all of our West Coast cities from Seattle
[3:39:44.600 --> 3:39:51.240]  to San Diego and now all of a sudden the Pentagon and the media is acting like
[3:39:51.240 --> 3:39:55.960]  oh they don't have the capability but they're sure trying to get it. Well if
[3:39:55.960 --> 3:40:01.560]  they had it in March of 2003 I don't think their technology has regressed so
[3:40:01.560 --> 3:40:06.120]  someone in the Pentagon as well as the media isn't being very honest with us.
[3:40:06.120 --> 3:40:09.680]  Alright John what yeah that's an excellent point go to your question.
[3:40:09.680 --> 3:40:14.760]  That was it. It's a very good question. No I think you're John you're
[3:40:14.760 --> 3:40:19.320]  absolutely right. There is an effort to lull the American people into believing
[3:40:19.320 --> 3:40:24.400]  that the dictator in North Korea is such a screw-up that he could not possibly
[3:40:24.400 --> 3:40:29.880]  develop a deliverable nuclear weapons that could annihilate this country. Is
[3:40:29.880 --> 3:40:35.440]  that a chance that you want to take? It's not a chance that I want to take and
[3:40:35.440 --> 3:40:39.000]  therefore I sleep a little better knowing that Donald Trump is in the White
[3:40:39.000 --> 3:40:45.120]  House because he will not draw a line in the sand and watch our adversaries
[3:40:45.120 --> 3:40:51.000]  cover it sitting back helplessly and doing nothing. Let's stay tuned on next
[3:40:51.000 --> 3:40:55.720]  one. Thank you for your call John. Let's go to Karen in Kansas. Karen you're here
[3:40:55.720 --> 3:41:04.080]  at Infowars. What do you have to say today? Hi Mr. Stone. My point is I did vote for
[3:41:04.080 --> 3:41:12.840]  Donald Trump at the urging of a friend of mine who watches the show and admires
[3:41:12.840 --> 3:41:20.440]  you quite a bit by the way. My point is I've been studying politics as
[3:41:20.440 --> 3:41:28.320]  an amateur since the 70s and I just see that as in the past the liberal
[3:41:28.320 --> 3:41:35.200]  Democrats, neocons, for instance the PNAC signers, all their co-workers, they
[3:41:35.200 --> 3:41:42.320]  have been able to successfully use the GOP to, it looks to me like in this case
[3:41:42.320 --> 3:41:51.680]  with Kushner and Ivanka, to even fast-track the agenda that now you can
[3:41:51.680 --> 3:41:58.040]  call globalist, I used to call it communism, but now I guess it's just flat
[3:41:58.040 --> 3:42:07.040]  out global, globalism. So why are we supposed to be putting on blinders to
[3:42:07.040 --> 3:42:12.800]  this and following Trump and trusting him? When he has people that are working
[3:42:12.800 --> 3:42:24.280]  with, for instance, perhaps ISIS, Israel's agenda to disguise what they're
[3:42:24.280 --> 3:42:32.040]  doing as ISIS attacks, can you help us to be aligned with
[3:42:32.040 --> 3:42:37.920]  Trump and his pro-business and how does this all work together? I just
[3:42:37.920 --> 3:42:47.960]  see it as undermining our cause of liberty. I think I got your question.
[3:42:47.960 --> 3:42:53.320]  Let me try to handle it. First of all, let's recognize the alternative. Had we
[3:42:53.320 --> 3:42:57.240]  elected Hillary Clinton, we would probably already be at nuclear war. She
[3:42:57.240 --> 3:43:01.480]  would have imposed a no-fly zone in Syria, which the Pentagon and the boys at
[3:43:01.480 --> 3:43:07.320]  the CIA and Langley so desperately want. Donald Trump is not perfect. He has
[3:43:07.320 --> 3:43:13.040]  never claimed to be perfect, nor did I think that like every other outsider
[3:43:13.040 --> 3:43:17.520]  president that we have elected, Ronald Reagan comes to mind, that there would be
[3:43:17.520 --> 3:43:25.000]  an intensive and insidious effort to co-opt his presidency. I'm prepared to
[3:43:25.000 --> 3:43:30.880]  fight for the success of the Trump agenda and I know many who communicate
[3:43:30.880 --> 3:43:35.720]  with the president, myself included, who are highly confident that the president
[3:43:35.720 --> 3:43:43.760]  does understand this insidious effort. Now we are going to face some watershed
[3:43:43.760 --> 3:43:51.320]  moments going ahead because personnel is policy and it is a mistake not to
[3:43:51.320 --> 3:43:57.600]  recognize the importance of these presidential appointments. Yes, it has
[3:43:57.600 --> 3:44:03.560]  been a two-party duopoly that has brought this country to its knees. I say
[3:44:03.560 --> 3:44:08.320]  that with great sentimental attachment to the Republican Party of Abraham Lincoln
[3:44:08.320 --> 3:44:14.520]  and Barry Goldwater, Ronald Reagan. But let's tell the truth. Both parties have
[3:44:14.520 --> 3:44:19.440]  been involved in the effort to erode our national sovereignty. Both parties have
[3:44:19.440 --> 3:44:25.960]  been complicit in the effort to ship American jobs abroad and sap the
[3:44:25.960 --> 3:44:32.360]  vitality out of this nation. The fight will continue. I'm going to put my bet
[3:44:32.360 --> 3:44:40.840]  on Donald Trump. He is a very bright, tough, intuitive individual. He is still
[3:44:40.840 --> 3:44:45.640]  trying to find the levers of power in Washington. He is, after all, not an
[3:44:45.640 --> 3:44:51.560]  experienced or polished inside the Beltway politician. But don't underestimate
[3:44:51.560 --> 3:44:57.280]  him. He is a patriot. He is a believer in American exceptionalism and sovereignty.
[3:44:57.280 --> 3:45:02.160]  And in the end, Karen, I think he will do the right thing. And I think he can be
[3:45:02.160 --> 3:45:10.400]  one of our greatest presidents. Let's go now to, let's see, oh let's go to Mike in
[3:45:10.400 --> 3:45:16.640]  Iowa. I think it is. Let me see the board. Or let's go to Carlos in Canada. Why
[3:45:16.640 --> 3:45:21.640]  not get a an offshore right? Or I should say in this case a non-US call. Carlos,
[3:45:21.640 --> 3:45:27.360]  what do you have for us today? Thank you. Good afternoon. Just basically to make
[3:45:27.360 --> 3:45:33.760]  president, I'm with you 100%. The levers of power are still complex to someone
[3:45:33.760 --> 3:45:37.080]  that comes from the business community and doesn't have the political
[3:45:37.080 --> 3:45:41.480]  experience. Just wanted to draw your attention. I made a call a little while
[3:45:41.480 --> 3:45:47.960]  back to Alex Jones to notify him that, in fact, under the echelon program, various
[3:45:47.960 --> 3:45:54.040]  countries share information intelligence with the NSA. And in the context, in that
[3:45:54.040 --> 3:46:01.440]  context, these countries, New Zealand, Canada, the UK and the United States, share
[3:46:01.440 --> 3:46:06.680]  the metadata with these countries. So at that point, I mentioned that in
[3:46:06.680 --> 3:46:11.840]  Canada, we had given information and metadata information and content
[3:46:11.840 --> 3:46:16.960]  information to Margaret Thatcher. A few days later, Judge Napolitano identified
[3:46:16.960 --> 3:46:22.400]  the UK as having been the country that had supplied that information, leaked
[3:46:22.400 --> 3:46:29.400]  information about President Trump. And subsequently, I was denied, but then it
[3:46:29.400 --> 3:46:34.320]  has been admitted. I just wanted to draw your attention to you and through you
[3:46:34.320 --> 3:46:39.840]  to President Trump and to anyone that is listening, that James Bamford wrote a
[3:46:39.840 --> 3:46:49.800]  seminal article on the NSA dated September 16, 2014, in which he mentioned
[3:46:49.800 --> 3:46:54.720]  that as part of an agreement, another country, Israel, receives all the
[3:46:54.720 --> 3:47:01.440]  unfiltered data, unfiltered, not just metadata, but all transmission facts,
[3:47:01.440 --> 3:47:07.720]  communications, directly from the NSA as part of an agreement. And this was
[3:47:07.720 --> 3:47:16.000]  echoed as well here earlier by Greenwald and it was revealed by the
[3:47:16.000 --> 3:47:19.200]  General Leakage of Information coming from Edward Snowden.
[3:47:19.200 --> 3:47:23.360]  All right, well Carlos, let me comment on that because we are running out of
[3:47:23.360 --> 3:47:28.320]  time here. I think you've raised a very good point several weeks ago when my
[3:47:28.320 --> 3:47:34.160]  very good friend, Judge Andrew Napolitano, said that he had impeccable sources
[3:47:34.160 --> 3:47:39.520]  telling him that the British had been involved in the surveillance of Donald
[3:47:39.520 --> 3:47:46.240]  Trump. This is a very common occurrence and practice by the intelligence
[3:47:46.240 --> 3:47:52.520]  agencies. When they go to a foreign ally, ask them to conduct a certain
[3:47:52.520 --> 3:47:58.840]  surveillance and then lag the information to the US. This allows them
[3:47:58.840 --> 3:48:07.160]  complete deniability and the ability to avoid breaking US law still achieving
[3:48:07.160 --> 3:48:14.120]  their spying objective. Now as you may know, there was a vehement denial from
[3:48:14.120 --> 3:48:22.680]  both the US NSA intelligence services and from the Brits and Judge Napolitano
[3:48:22.680 --> 3:48:31.720]  was actually suspended for one week at Fox News for being incorrect. Now we learn
[3:48:31.720 --> 3:48:39.560]  that Judge Napolitano was 100% correct and the Brits were in fact conducting
[3:48:39.560 --> 3:48:45.280]  surveillance at the best of the NSA. I still hold that that surveillance was
[3:48:45.280 --> 3:48:52.640]  with political, not criminal or illegal behavior and certainly not treason. This
[3:48:52.640 --> 3:48:59.720]  is a story that's still unfolding. Bottom line, the people at Fox, the very top
[3:48:59.720 --> 3:49:07.520]  leadership at Fox, well they owe Judge Napolitano an apology and one week's pay
[3:49:07.520 --> 3:49:14.920]  for the week that he was suspended. Before we go on to our next segment, I want
[3:49:14.920 --> 3:49:21.720]  to remind you that the InfowarsStore.com is open for business and your
[3:49:21.720 --> 3:49:27.320]  support for Infowars is more important than ever before. Folks, we are under
[3:49:27.320 --> 3:49:33.560]  attack here from Google, from Facebook, from the Ministry of Truth, the secret
[3:49:33.560 --> 3:49:40.360]  censorship board set up by Barack Obama. So go to the store, I particularly like
[3:49:40.360 --> 3:49:47.720]  the the SHIELD X2 nascent iodine product. Grab this while you can because make no
[3:49:47.720 --> 3:49:54.760]  mistake about it. There is an effort to grab the very best iodine and make it
[3:49:54.760 --> 3:50:00.040]  unavailable to Infowars. Now this is a product that is going to run out quickly.
[3:50:00.040 --> 3:50:07.920]  You can grab it right now for 25% off and I cannot recommend highly enough
[3:50:07.920 --> 3:50:14.600]  that you make your move. You can support the fight for liberty and truth and you
[3:50:14.600 --> 3:50:20.120]  can bolster your health, your immunity and your own survival. Please go to the
[3:50:20.120 --> 3:50:25.080]  store and give us the support we so desperately need here at Infowars by
[3:50:25.080 --> 3:50:35.840]  going to the InfowarsStore.com. We are going to be right back. We're going to take some
[3:50:35.840 --> 3:50:41.400]  more of your calls. I'm Roger Stone, filling in for my friend Alex Jones. Don't
[3:50:41.400 --> 3:50:58.040]  go away. We'll be right back.
[3:50:58.040 --> 3:51:02.840]  Don't become dependent on the medical system. Get and stay healthy naturally
[3:51:02.840 --> 3:51:07.040]  with extended weight. Metals in the liver cause peroxides to get dumped into
[3:51:07.040 --> 3:51:11.160]  the bloodstream. Peroxides do more damage than free radicals to the arteries and
[3:51:11.160 --> 3:51:16.600]  the LDL has no protection from peroxides causing the LDL to get stuck in the
[3:51:16.600 --> 3:51:21.600]  arteries creating a potential blockage. Extendivite slowly chelates the metals
[3:51:21.600 --> 3:51:26.320]  away from the liver so it can dispose of what was meant to be a harmless process
[3:51:26.320 --> 3:51:31.400]  peroxide. Extendivite's seven herbs has a job to strengthen the organs and
[3:51:31.400 --> 3:51:35.640]  circulatory highway. Can you afford a heart attack? Extendivite is available in

[3:54:08.880 --> 3:54:15.160]  He loves the game, he has fun with it and he's very good at it. I'm an agent
[3:54:15.160 --> 3:54:20.560]  provocateur. Political strategist, controversial as you can get, an
[3:54:20.560 --> 3:54:25.160]  incredible capacity for treachery, win-it-all-cost mentality. When people
[3:54:25.160 --> 3:54:30.160]  think of Washington corruption they think of Roger Stone. Those who say I have
[3:54:30.160 --> 3:54:34.240]  no soul, those who say I have no principles are losers, those are bitter
[3:54:34.240 --> 3:54:41.040]  losers. There's really nobody quite like Roger Stone. The Nixon tattoo is really
[3:54:41.040 --> 3:54:46.060]  all you need to know about Roger. We really pioneered negative campaign
[3:54:46.060 --> 3:54:52.480]  advertising. He created the modern sleazeball lobbyists. Washington's been
[3:54:52.480 --> 3:54:57.120]  worse for it ever since. Stone's rule. It is better to be infamous than never be
[3:54:57.120 --> 3:55:02.080]  famous at all. A swinger scandal happened. My private life is nobody's business.
[3:55:02.080 --> 3:55:07.680]  Got chased out of Washington. He's looking to see if he can find an angle. I
[3:55:07.680 --> 3:55:10.800]  was like a jockey looking for a horse. Can't win the race if you don't have a
[3:55:10.800 --> 3:55:13.000]  horse.
[3:55:22.640 --> 3:55:28.280]  Roger saw something that nobody else saw back in the early 80s. I suggested that
[3:55:28.280 --> 3:55:32.880]  Trump should explore a bit from presidency. He created Donald Trump as a
[3:55:32.880 --> 3:55:38.960]  political figure. What am I lying about? Have you spoken with the WikiLeaks founder?
[3:55:38.960 --> 3:55:44.920]  Roger, you can't just say that. You have to be outrageous to get noticed.
[3:55:44.920 --> 3:55:51.320]  America may be collapsing, but Roger Stone is determined to enjoy it.
[3:55:54.840 --> 3:56:02.000]  I revel in your hatred because if I weren't effective you wouldn't hate me.
[3:56:02.000 --> 3:56:13.640]  And that is the trailer for the upcoming documentary by Netflix. Get me
[3:56:13.640 --> 3:56:20.800]  Roger Stone, which will debut, actually premiere this weekend this Sunday at the
[3:56:20.800 --> 3:56:26.920]  Tri-Becca Film Festival. There are then four showings next week exclusively in
[3:56:26.920 --> 3:56:33.880]  New York, and then it will be available in early May on Netflix. I myself have not
[3:56:33.880 --> 3:56:39.800]  seen the full documentary, but just let me say that which does not kill me
[3:56:39.800 --> 3:56:47.880]  makes me stronger. We are also happy to tell you that I will be right here in the
[3:56:47.880 --> 3:56:55.680]  Austin area tonight at the Round Rock Barnes & Noble at 2701 Parker Road in
[3:56:55.680 --> 3:57:00.280]  Round Rock, Texas. We're gonna have some speaking, a little Q&A, and then I'll be
[3:57:00.280 --> 3:57:05.720]  signing books for any Patriots or Fine Liberty-Leaning Americans who want to
[3:57:05.720 --> 3:57:11.480]  come by. So I look forward to meeting you tonight. And then tomorrow night I will
[3:57:11.480 --> 3:57:17.680]  be yet again, as I said earlier, in San Antonio, one of my favorite towns from
[3:57:17.680 --> 3:57:26.680]  530-9 at Artisa in Quarry Village, that's 300 East Bass Road in San Antonio.
[3:57:26.680 --> 3:57:34.360]  That's tomorrow night. So by all means, if you're in the San Antonio area, join us.
[3:57:34.360 --> 3:57:41.560]  Lastly, let me ask you one more time, go to the InfowarsStore.com, get your copy
[3:57:41.560 --> 3:57:48.600]  of the making of the President 2016, how Donald Trump orchestrated an American
[3:57:48.600 --> 3:57:53.920]  Revolution. Folks, this is the inside story of how Donald Trump pulled off the
[3:57:53.920 --> 3:58:00.160]  greatest political upset in American history, and it outlines the crucial role
[3:58:00.160 --> 3:58:07.280]  the Infowars.com played in that victory. That's why Donald Trump's prospects for
[3:58:07.280 --> 3:58:12.920]  re-election, without a strong vibrant economy and a strong vibrant alternative
[3:58:12.920 --> 3:58:18.840]  media, are nil. That's why we need your support here at Infowars.com. So please,
[3:58:18.840 --> 3:58:25.280]  folks, go to the store and help us continue the fight to make America great
[3:58:25.280 --> 3:58:39.400]  again. Thanks.
