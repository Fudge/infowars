[00:00.000 --> 00:17.480]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance you're listening to Alex Jones
[00:30.000 --> 00:43.040]  Ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us on this Thursday already the
[00:43.040 --> 00:51.160]  third day of May 2018 worldwide broadcast I am your host Alex Jones and look
[00:51.160 --> 00:55.800]  at the headlines I have here in front of me aren't they interesting wired
[00:55.800 --> 01:08.920]  magazine 5g smartphones cause cancer big wireless doesn't want you to know now
[01:08.920 --> 01:13.680]  think about that because I've noticed what they attack me with on mainstream
[01:13.680 --> 01:18.800]  news and on the so-called comedy shows Jones claims your cell phones are
[01:18.800 --> 01:22.560]  killing you Jones claims there's chemicals in the water that are lowering
[01:22.560 --> 01:28.960]  your fertility and confusing your sexuality Jones says there's black
[01:28.960 --> 01:35.600]  helicopters Jones says there's a world government Jones says the EU is
[01:35.600 --> 01:41.400]  unelected it is on and on and on and everything we're saying is out in the
[01:41.400 --> 01:49.280]  open so think about how the LA Times even wired magazine will admit there are
[01:49.280 --> 01:56.560]  thousands of studies that prove that wireless radiation as it's intensified
[01:56.560 --> 02:02.600]  in its strength the last 30 years and in how many places it's emanating from and
[02:02.600 --> 02:11.240]  especially the microwave millimeter waves cell phones operate as microwave
[02:11.240 --> 02:19.800]  transmitters and receivers now what's a microwave do it vibrates water vibrates
[02:19.800 --> 02:25.960]  molecules and 5g is in even more powerful form of microwaves that even
[02:25.960 --> 02:31.120]  rattles it faster that's what causes the heat the fraction of the molecules and
[02:31.120 --> 02:36.200]  burns oxygen and carbon dioxide we're going to cover those studies you heard
[02:36.200 --> 02:41.360]  me right 5g burns the atmosphere
[02:43.080 --> 02:49.360]  5g destroys ozone so they're telling us we're going to destroy ozone but not
[02:49.360 --> 02:55.120]  telling us what really does it and then doing it that doesn't sound like
[02:55.120 --> 03:00.640]  something humans would do why are the globalists doing this why are they
[03:00.640 --> 03:09.160]  changing the atmosphere who are they now ladies and gentlemen the question is
[03:09.160 --> 03:19.040]  how do we get people out of their trance how are we going to do that we're
[03:19.040 --> 03:23.480]  gonna talk about that today in the second hour and lay out mainline studies
[03:23.480 --> 03:34.040]  mainline science that 5g and even the lower four and 3g your game boxes a lot
[03:34.040 --> 03:37.640]  of your appliances the smart meters
[03:40.240 --> 03:45.320]  surveil and dial in to everything digital in your house and steal your data
[03:45.320 --> 03:50.120]  they physically listen to you audibly and they watch you not with the
[03:50.120 --> 03:55.800]  conventional iris and a camera visually but with the millimeter waves the same
[03:55.800 --> 04:00.560]  way a naked body scanner reads you at the airport it shoots out and reads
[04:00.560 --> 04:06.080]  everything in your house but you invite the little Alex's in you invite the
[04:06.080 --> 04:09.720]  little Google assistance in there's a big race you know the security companies
[04:09.720 --> 04:16.120]  oh it sits there it listens to you it watches it cares and a lot of them
[04:16.120 --> 04:20.520]  kick on when there's burglaries or the sounds of people being upset or they
[04:20.520 --> 04:24.720]  call the police for you you know there's certainly a good side to the double
[04:24.720 --> 04:32.640]  edge but it was designed as a Trojan horse we're gonna cover it all today and
[04:32.640 --> 04:37.240]  black helicopters terrified the public in a major city of New Jersey with
[04:37.240 --> 04:40.840]  explosions a machine gun fire on purpose will explain the story behind the story
[04:40.840 --> 04:44.720]  have the powerful video coming up and then we have so much more that we're
[04:44.720 --> 04:49.800]  going to be looking at here today that is absolutely critical the latest on
[04:49.800 --> 04:56.320]  Kanye West and so much more I'm Alex Jones with info wars.com
[05:00.080 --> 05:04.480]  I'm not a rocket scientist but I know to go out and check the top scientists see
[05:04.480 --> 05:08.680]  what they say and they have talked about for decades that a lot of the mental
[05:08.680 --> 05:13.360]  disorders a lot of the behavioral disorders a lot of the autism spectrum
[05:13.360 --> 05:19.200]  disorders are in the gut from the diets and vaccines that trigger autoimmune
[05:19.200 --> 05:24.720]  responses in the stomach that then create major toxicity in the gut causing
[05:24.720 --> 05:29.320]  toxicity of the brain here's a big BBC report today how bacteria are changing
[05:29.320 --> 05:32.520]  your mood if you have the wrong ones you're depressed well ladies and
[05:32.520 --> 05:37.160]  gentlemen it's been sold out for much my cozy x is back anti-fungal anti-ease
[05:37.160 --> 05:40.920]  anti-candida it goes in and knocks out the walls in your intestines where these
[05:40.920 --> 05:45.040]  things colonize it and put a slime wall in but the nutrients go through they get
[05:45.040 --> 05:49.040]  what they want first they colonize you then they secrete toxins in you that
[05:49.040 --> 05:53.040]  cause depression they can even secrete toxins when they want more sugar this is
[05:53.040 --> 05:59.720]  well-known nukem with my cozy x exclusively at info wars life.com
[05:59.720 --> 06:13.880]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones coming to
[06:13.880 --> 06:24.120]  you live from the front lines of the info war thank you for joining us on this
[06:24.120 --> 06:29.680]  live Thursday the third day of May 2018 I'm your host Alex Jones we've got
[06:29.680 --> 06:33.920]  a lot of really informative powerful guests joining us James O'Keeffe has
[06:33.920 --> 06:39.800]  another big bombshell inside the bizarre state-run education programs in this
[06:39.800 --> 06:46.160]  country shocking information looking at organized cover-up of abusive students
[06:46.160 --> 06:49.680]  at the highest level so we're gonna be looking at that shocking video and
[06:49.680 --> 06:55.520]  talking to James O'Keeffe we're gonna have Dr. Group in studio to break down the
[06:55.520 --> 07:01.480]  mainline medical science that 5g and even below is massively increasing cancer
[07:01.480 --> 07:06.040]  and it's currently it's estimated in mainline science will go over killing
[07:06.040 --> 07:11.400]  more people than cigarettes you heard me right and they're only upping the power
[07:11.400 --> 07:17.160]  and we'll go into why they want this system now it's being used as a system
[07:17.160 --> 07:22.320]  to kill fertility but Oprah Winfrey Ted Turner Bill Gates and others Warren
[07:22.320 --> 07:27.040]  Buffett meet each year to discuss a planetary world government plan to go
[07:27.040 --> 07:31.160]  vertly reduce world population six years ago they went ahead and admitted they do
[07:31.160 --> 07:36.760]  meet with that plan and that you just type that in Bill Gates Oprah Winfrey and
[07:36.760 --> 07:41.240]  others meet to discuss world depopulation you might want to read it
[07:41.240 --> 07:45.880]  because it's going on right now and the 5g and the atrazine and all of it now
[07:45.880 --> 07:50.600]  I've always noticed what is it they don't want me to talk about they don't want me
[07:50.600 --> 07:54.320]  to ever talk about
[07:55.880 --> 08:01.320]  Islam taking over they don't me talk about atrazine and chemicals reducing
[08:01.320 --> 08:06.680]  fertility and they don't want me talking about cell phone radiation causing cancer
[08:06.680 --> 08:10.760]  but also causing heart problems mental illness you name it in all the major
[08:10.760 --> 08:16.960]  studies and now they're gonna mount well beyond 5g high-powered microwave
[08:16.960 --> 08:23.400]  transmitters on the bottoms of quote all major commercial aircraft you see the
[08:23.400 --> 08:30.240]  TV ads on Fox running for this so quote you'll have Wi-Fi all over the country
[08:30.240 --> 08:36.320]  even in rural areas even if you don't want it blasting down on you and of
[08:36.320 --> 08:40.360]  course London telegraph reports on mainline studies will be covering later
[08:40.360 --> 08:47.960]  mobile phone cancer warning as malignant brain tumors dot dot dot dot dot dot double
[08:47.960 --> 08:54.480]  double oh it's your fun phone you play with your friends you put up your head
[08:54.480 --> 09:05.800]  you hold it there and you are cooking your brain total fact but you know it's
[09:05.800 --> 09:09.960]  funny that the scientists even admit this is happening because what do they
[09:09.960 --> 09:16.760]  make fun of me on on Colbert and the HBO shows and the showtime shows the
[09:16.760 --> 09:20.960]  homeland shows and it was even in the news last week they said homeland all the
[09:20.960 --> 09:25.800]  other big media outlets Netflix all up and go they rotate out a week each of the
[09:25.800 --> 09:31.320]  year and they meet it lately Virginia at the CIA and they learn what they're
[09:31.320 --> 09:35.280]  supposed to say and they're supposed to say Alex Jones is bad
[09:35.280 --> 09:40.960]  cell phone radiation doesn't hurt you vaccines never hurt you there's no geo
[09:40.960 --> 09:44.880]  engineering going on even though it's all declassified admitted and there's no
[09:44.880 --> 09:49.320]  world government and everything's fine and the sperm counts aren't down 87%
[09:49.320 --> 09:54.200]  and depression isn't massively up in the youth course it all is and there's
[09:54.200 --> 09:58.760]  again everything's fine and oh it also remember the old one I remember I was
[09:58.760 --> 10:03.360]  first on air 23 years ago and it would be in soldier of fortune or it would be
[10:03.360 --> 10:07.800]  in a local newspaper that 14 black helicopters as they were described
[10:07.800 --> 10:12.240]  showed up and then attacked the old school that was scheduled for demolition
[10:12.240 --> 10:19.120]  the next month shedding it on fire three people at the old folks homes had
[10:19.120 --> 10:24.040]  heart attacks and I would I was decompartmentalizing news I don't realize
[10:24.040 --> 10:27.560]  what I was doing at the time but I would take some local story from South Texas
[10:27.560 --> 10:33.040]  or a story that somebody mailed me from Indiana or people mailed me VHS tapes as
[10:33.040 --> 10:35.840]  I was on local radio but use that to syndicate out on the satellite and I was
[10:35.840 --> 10:41.200]  on I don't like 15 radio stations even by 1996 or so and global shortwave and
[10:41.200 --> 10:45.440]  satellite and then the caveman people had on their houses then a lot of them
[10:45.440 --> 10:48.440]  still do it's not an audience but people that cared that were looking for the truth
[10:48.440 --> 10:51.960]  and they were the ones that educated me I was just a mainline libertarian kind of
[10:51.960 --> 10:55.360]  conservative knew a lot of history but didn't get get the big picture they
[10:55.360 --> 11:02.360]  educated me real fast and so I would play on the radio clips of local news
[11:02.360 --> 11:10.280]  about you know foreign troops with the army and blowing up buildings and no one
[11:10.280 --> 11:17.400]  was told I'd play it and they would have the state police write an article for
[11:17.400 --> 11:23.720]  the Austin American statesman saying Jones is insane Jones is dangerous none
[11:23.720 --> 11:29.760]  of this exists and they put on the front page of the paper and I would have
[11:29.760 --> 11:33.920]  been the San Antonio police chief on I'd have the Austin police I talked to them
[11:33.920 --> 11:37.520]  I'd have the emergency manager Kingsville on they would they would
[11:37.520 --> 11:41.480]  tell how it was the Delta Force and how they were there with with Czech
[11:41.480 --> 11:45.320]  Republic and German troops and and I wasn't even attacking the military but
[11:45.320 --> 11:48.680]  they'd say Jones is attacking our military and doesn't want you to trust
[11:48.680 --> 11:53.160]  them and then they would do these pre-training deals where they sometimes
[11:53.160 --> 12:00.000]  they would warn them they knock on doors and say Alex Jones hates America and he
[12:00.000 --> 12:03.280]  may be coming to talk to you when he comes don't talk to him this is in my
[12:03.280 --> 12:06.760]  films police state one police state two and I had the locals going yeah the
[12:06.760 --> 12:10.680]  army colonel came by yesterday and said don't talk to you you're an enemy I
[12:10.680 --> 12:15.040]  don't think you're an enemy and they came and it was scary and I know who you
[12:15.040 --> 12:19.360]  are and they you I heard you a year ago say this and then they came and it was
[12:19.360 --> 12:30.140]  blowing it up over there so so it became this big challenge for me because the
[12:30.140 --> 12:35.520]  news nationally would say there are no black helicopters it's not happening and
[12:35.520 --> 12:39.760]  I didn't even know what was going on now I know it was a Psyop to train the
[12:39.760 --> 12:43.720]  public that a martial law ever came in when they came in to take out the local
[12:43.720 --> 12:47.240]  government it ordered by Bill Clinton who was preparing this he was testing it
[12:47.240 --> 12:53.680]  that they wanted the locals to lay down during the assault and that's why every
[12:53.680 --> 13:02.560]  major town in the US has had multiple army Air Force Marines you name it
[13:02.560 --> 13:10.640]  invasions most of them unannounced is so that when they decide to really hit you
[13:10.640 --> 13:14.520]  you don't know what hit you and again the military is later how I learned
[13:14.520 --> 13:21.080]  about this the San Antonio police chief was in army intelligence the head of
[13:21.080 --> 13:26.480]  emergency management in Kingsville he was in secret operations in the army so
[13:26.480 --> 13:29.920]  if they knew what it was about and the word was Bill Clinton because they were
[13:29.920 --> 13:34.080]  finally told by Delta Force that they didn't like it and they apologized in
[13:34.080 --> 13:37.520]  Kingsville and then later in Austin they went ahead and told the head of the
[13:37.520 --> 13:40.720]  SWAT team they fire the Travis County head once he told me they said look we
[13:40.720 --> 13:45.680]  apologize this is a PDD gun confiscation martial law drill in case
[13:45.680 --> 13:50.120]  state houses or any county stand up during a UN takeover and we now know
[13:50.120 --> 13:54.400]  that's all real Loretta Lynch wanted it the strong cities initiative they wanted
[13:54.400 --> 13:58.080]  to cause a race war then have the UN come in and put departments under the UN
[13:58.080 --> 14:03.600]  that was in the local paper here so I would cover all this I had police chiefs
[14:03.600 --> 14:07.120]  and emergency managers telling me and the Delta Force had told them they
[14:07.120 --> 14:10.800]  didn't like it that Bill Clinton was telling them and man they got pissed I
[14:10.800 --> 14:14.280]  mean they had the guys come and physically attack me all sorts of stuff
[14:14.280 --> 14:18.360]  I'm not gonna get into on air but the point is that I got the message you
[14:18.360 --> 14:25.480]  better shut up but that was from Clinton goons not the military now what just
[14:25.480 --> 14:33.480]  hit last night this is CBS local comm New York Department of Defense training
[14:33.480 --> 14:39.520]  exercise terrifies unprepared New Jersey residents it all started off as well
[14:39.520 --> 14:42.560]  kept secret but the explosives and helicopters ended up giving it away
[14:42.560 --> 14:45.680]  members of the US Department of Defense were conducting training recently in
[14:45.680 --> 14:48.680]  New Jersey neighborhood and the result was plenty of residents with frayed
[14:48.680 --> 14:55.360]  nerves Nick Braden reported for CBS channel to other cities sue Defense
[14:55.360 --> 14:58.600]  Department and then over gun check reporting is another one cell phone
[14:58.600 --> 15:03.520]  video captured the moment we'll roll some of that guys a helicopter flew above
[15:03.520 --> 15:07.320]  there was excitement and the photographer voice but that's because the
[15:07.320 --> 15:11.840]  video was taken on the second night of action they didn't warn them the first
[15:11.840 --> 15:15.120]  night residents say they never seen anything like it before now here's the
[15:15.120 --> 15:21.160]  deal now they admit this and it's being done now for different reasons but
[15:21.160 --> 15:26.640]  anti-terrorism training but the overall mission was to acclimate us and so it
[15:26.640 --> 15:31.400]  was huge under Clinton some happen under Bush came back under Obama is still
[15:31.400 --> 15:36.200]  continuing and I'll get into what's behind it but remember remember that
[15:36.200 --> 15:39.680]  didn't exist remember you were insane remember the black helicopter people and
[15:39.680 --> 15:43.840]  oh they're crazy and oh they say they saw keep you out the middle of Alabama
[15:43.840 --> 15:47.240]  there'd be a Marine Corps checkpoint searching people when we get the video
[15:47.240 --> 15:52.200]  they go Jones is crazy there were no Marines searching vehicles here and so
[15:52.200 --> 15:56.240]  this is all part of the acclamation and again another thing where you get
[15:56.240 --> 16:01.800]  decades of news before attention business owners and independent contractors
[16:01.800 --> 16:06.040]  this is a money-saving message from tax mediation services if your business

[20:34.120 --> 20:42.240]  well everyone in 2018 knows that your town your city has had an unannounced 8
[20:42.240 --> 20:48.840]  to 14 to 20 plus black helicopters they're painted black with paint that
[20:48.840 --> 20:55.160]  helps absorb radar waves not your classic deep army green you've all
[20:55.160 --> 21:01.160]  experienced the night stalkers out of Fort Campbell Kentucky deliver army
[21:01.160 --> 21:08.960]  personnel for training to operate in the United States it's to acclimate them
[21:08.960 --> 21:15.240]  it's to acclimate you but just remember in the early 1990s when the activity was
[21:15.240 --> 21:20.960]  I've got to say hundreds of times what it is now I mean it was black
[21:20.960 --> 21:27.680]  helicopters hitting towns every couple days it was a major massive operation
[21:27.680 --> 21:37.080]  under Bill Clinton that started about 94 and it was to train everybody to accept
[21:37.080 --> 21:45.080]  Waco type attacks on churches on city halls on state houses that was usually
[21:45.080 --> 21:51.520]  too obvious to hit a capital so they would hit courthouses and you've seen
[21:51.520 --> 21:56.120]  federal judges and state judges even Texas come out and say under Obama remember
[21:56.120 --> 21:58.760]  a few years ago they said if gun confiscation begins and they bring in
[21:58.760 --> 22:02.080]  UN troops we're going to have to get armored personnel carriers for the
[22:02.080 --> 22:05.480]  sheriff's department to fight it people thought man that's crazy but the
[22:05.480 --> 22:11.080]  national media barely picked it up when state judges and others said that
[22:11.080 --> 22:16.680]  because they'd been briefed via FEMA on the plan that was what four years ago
[22:16.680 --> 22:20.280]  they had a couple big judges come out and then a year later Loretta Lynch goes
[22:20.280 --> 22:24.920]  we're gonna have the UN run local departments if there's a race for and
[22:24.920 --> 22:29.200]  now we have the documents they were trying to start one I mean I used to
[22:29.200 --> 22:32.200]  hear this from our military sources and I thought they were messing with us I
[22:32.200 --> 22:40.720]  would say sources say 20 years ago now the plans public you can see my films
[22:40.720 --> 22:44.920]  free online police state one police state two please say three police state
[22:44.920 --> 22:54.760]  four they all have the black helicopters the local police the Marine Corps
[22:54.760 --> 23:02.320]  checkpoints the army took over the role of taking over local government at
[23:02.320 --> 23:05.240]  hitting first you think the Marines would hit first but it was usually army
[23:05.240 --> 23:07.800]  training at first Marines would then come in and take control of the
[23:07.800 --> 23:17.040]  population and process people I mean it's just incredible ladies and gentlemen
[23:19.360 --> 23:24.880]  we're Americans we deserve you help us no don't take our guns you'll see the
[23:24.880 --> 23:32.240]  video and the national news when this came out CNN played clips in the mid
[23:32.240 --> 23:38.160]  nineties and said Alex Jones is a liar he hired fake Marines they said the
[23:38.160 --> 23:42.520]  footage you're watching of your TV viewer is fake hovercraft landing the
[23:42.520 --> 23:49.440]  Coronata amphibious ship landing they claimed I faked it now that's how dumb
[23:49.440 --> 23:55.280]  they think you are the atrazine didn't sterilize in you and turning mammals
[23:55.280 --> 24:02.960]  amphibians into asexual hemathridites yes it's all admitted thousands of
[24:02.960 --> 24:08.080]  studies 5g totally giving you massive cancer brain tumors already doubled the
[24:08.080 --> 24:16.080]  last decade journal of medicine just showed you the article earlier pass
[24:16.080 --> 24:21.200]  the side atrazine can turn male frogs into females boom Berkeley science
[24:21.200 --> 24:28.320]  department UC Berkeley Tyrone Hayes professor of integrative biology but it
[24:28.320 --> 24:36.800]  doesn't matter looking down his nose Ben Shapiro the unmade man none of these
[24:36.800 --> 24:39.800]  so-called fake conservatives can ever launch a company they've always got
[24:39.800 --> 24:43.000]  billionaires financing them which isn't a bad thing but we're the only outfit
[24:43.000 --> 24:47.480]  self-made no one else in media except Matt drudge is self-made no one Matt
[24:47.480 --> 24:52.120]  drudge and in force at this level no one else Matt drudge and in force that's
[24:52.120 --> 25:01.800]  it now think about that they say Ben Shapiro is buying the blaze no Texas
[25:01.800 --> 25:06.600]  billionaires that he's carpet bagged down here to get are trying to do it I
[25:06.600 --> 25:09.760]  think I'm gonna call those billionaires and warn those guys I know years ago I
[25:09.760 --> 25:12.520]  had a lot of people contact me and never got back because I'm a I'm finding my
[25:12.520 --> 25:16.760]  own operation here that's my mission but if Shapiro really wants to get in my
[25:16.760 --> 25:21.880]  business down here in Texas try to move down here we aren't exposed back as a
[25:21.880 --> 25:27.880]  fake he's out of business he's pretty much closed shop and you go reach
[25:27.880 --> 25:31.400]  Shapiro's website almost every comment can't stand him and hates him because
[25:31.400 --> 25:34.600]  it's this whole act of how he's intellectual and he's this genius and
[25:34.600 --> 25:37.720]  he's this wizard and he knows everything and then almost every comment I'm gonna
[25:37.720 --> 25:43.640]  show you later hate his guts and say oh you're so intellectual you use terms
[25:43.640 --> 25:50.360]  like Alex is awful and of course won't debate me and why am I mad because
[25:50.360 --> 25:54.360]  Glenn Beck got in my business with radio stations and would keep me off air I
[25:54.360 --> 25:57.680]  talked to many stationers and managers where they would threaten to not be on
[25:57.680 --> 26:01.200]  their station and do all the stuff if I wasn't taken off and now you're in my
[26:01.200 --> 26:04.920]  business again trying to tell people on to call my show I'm about to get in your
[26:04.920 --> 26:09.280]  business big-time you little arrogant son of a bitch
[26:09.280 --> 26:16.480]  now go back to California go back to Los Angeles where you came from wait till I
[26:16.480 --> 26:19.920]  go talk to those billionaires they're good Christian men seventh-day Adventist
[26:19.920 --> 26:23.760]  pastors and lay out how you and Jordan Peters you think I'm stupid because I'm
[26:23.760 --> 26:29.160]  from Texas wait till I go explain to those self-made men that you aren't as a
[26:29.160 --> 26:33.560]  self-made Texan myself how you and others in the atheist movement are taking
[26:33.560 --> 26:37.840]  control of the whole conservative movement and that's why the left puts
[26:37.840 --> 26:41.640]  Peterson and all you guys on TV and doesn't censor you but the whole atheist
[26:41.640 --> 26:46.040]  vent and the whole you know Christ isn't God thing all of that how did you
[26:46.040 --> 26:51.480]  convince Texas Christians to sit there and prop up Glenn Beck and now you you
[26:51.480 --> 26:54.520]  don't think I don't know everything about you bro and how you're trying to
[26:54.520 --> 27:02.880]  sucker them to buy the failed garbage blaze you can't make anything you
[27:02.880 --> 27:10.200]  parasite get behind me Satan we should pray for Ben Shapiro to find Christ
[27:10.200 --> 27:15.840]  because this whole act of how smart he is as he just sits there reads off a
[27:15.840 --> 27:22.440]  teleprompter and plagiarizes people in my view so you're in my business Shapiro
[27:22.440 --> 27:28.520]  I'm in your business now I might just go drive up to Cisco this weekend take a
[27:28.520 --> 27:34.440]  few Army officers with me and have a conversation with with the billionaires
[27:34.440 --> 27:40.440]  that are financing you maybe show them some files Shapiro want that think you

[28:19.480 --> 28:24.200]  offered Beck's job when they had him in the stable getting him trained 16 17 years
[28:24.200 --> 28:28.760]  ago and just like then they sent him in to be a fake Mormon to suck off the
[28:28.760 --> 28:32.680]  Mormon Church to launch his whole operation and that's what Shapiro does
[28:32.680 --> 28:36.480]  he comes down here with his whole little closeted atheist anti-Christian
[28:36.480 --> 28:41.680]  operation and he sucks off some Christians he thinks are dumbasses
[28:41.680 --> 28:47.480]  well son you want to fight you got one I love that you talked to Kanye West like

[30:02.360 --> 30:06.000]  my children up and I got some bad news for the second time in the five and a
[30:06.000 --> 30:10.640]  half year history of survival shield X to our flagship product we are having
[30:10.640 --> 30:15.320]  supply chain problems and this may be the last batch of this we have deep earth
[30:15.320 --> 30:20.240]  crystal source that's so pure that it actually turns into purple gas in the
[30:20.240 --> 30:25.160]  atmosphere and so in our own search to get the purest form we discovered that
[30:25.160 --> 30:28.920]  oil companies and gas drilling companies had a byproduct that they were
[30:28.920 --> 30:32.560]  selling to pharmaceutical companies and also drug makers they used to make drugs
[30:32.560 --> 30:36.680]  and once they figure out there's a market they start jacking up the price
[30:36.680 --> 30:42.080]  but we're offering it still 25% off until it sells out hopefully just like the
[30:42.080 --> 30:45.600]  last time it's happened a few years ago it's not an issue and we do get more but
[30:45.600 --> 30:50.360]  right now we are not able to secure the crystals that produce the purest iodine
[30:50.360 --> 30:55.520]  in the world but what it does is for stamina libido focus energy is really

[31:03.240 --> 31:08.480]  introducing pollen block we have found an extraordinary new natural way to
[31:08.480 --> 31:12.840]  alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and
[31:12.840 --> 31:18.520]  sinus passageways eye comfort and respiratory function in the 1960s
[31:18.520 --> 31:22.440]  researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[31:22.440 --> 31:27.120]  experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began
[31:27.120 --> 31:31.360]  studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the
[31:31.360 --> 31:35.840]  fruit of this research a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate
[31:35.840 --> 31:40.920]  seasonal distress symptoms pollen block is natural and effective it is not an
[31:40.920 --> 31:45.000]  antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually acts by
[31:45.000 --> 31:49.480]  blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and
[31:49.480 --> 31:54.080]  inflammatory responses in the body go outside and enjoy the air you breathe

[32:11.840 --> 32:18.000]  autism spectrum disorders are in the gut from the diets and vaccines that
[32:18.000 --> 32:23.480]  trigger autoimmune responses in the stomach that then create major toxicity

[32:55.360 --> 33:07.800]  exclusively at info wars live dot com you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:07.800 --> 33:28.120]  you found the front lines of the human awakening it's the info war and now
[33:28.120 --> 33:35.640]  alex jones show over the years I've had a lot of Texas oil people contact me
[33:35.640 --> 33:41.600]  and want to try to help info wars and I've never done it because I want to
[33:41.600 --> 33:46.600]  self-funded operation and I have that as an ace in the hole you know a lot of
[33:46.600 --> 33:50.560]  people that I can go to if I needed a lot of money that's why the whole Soros
[33:50.560 --> 33:54.200]  Hillary plan where they're in the news on NBC News saying they plan to shut me
[33:54.200 --> 33:58.760]  down they admit the Democratic Party's behind it that's why we don't want to go
[33:58.760 --> 34:01.800]  down that route but we're gonna win one way or another with our listeners
[34:01.800 --> 34:05.080]  supporting us with us putting it all into the fight expanding on the TV
[34:05.080 --> 34:08.240]  stations across the country the broadcast is exploding and I'm gonna get
[34:08.240 --> 34:11.760]  into all the other big-world news but the reason I'm attacking Ben Shapiro is
[34:11.760 --> 34:18.400]  he wasn't ripe enough when I heard about him years ago from one of the top
[34:18.400 --> 34:22.880]  talk show hosts in the country and just look out for this guy he's as bad as it
[34:22.880 --> 34:26.400]  gets I just heard from that national talk show host during the break we're
[34:26.400 --> 34:31.680]  talking one of the top three names and I was warned about him and I just ignore
[34:31.680 --> 34:36.960]  it because I try to be a team player and then I noticed Shapiro behind the
[34:36.960 --> 34:41.320]  scenes causing his problems and then also reaching out to people in a whisper
[34:41.320 --> 34:46.320]  campaign saying don't be associated with info wars just like CNN and MSNBC and
[34:46.320 --> 34:49.600]  George Soros and all them are doing and I just ignore it and move on because the
[34:49.600 --> 34:54.800]  guy just comes off so arrogant and then you know he has his own website that
[34:54.800 --> 34:59.280]  talks about what a genius he is all day and his own readers are just sick of it
[34:59.280 --> 35:08.000]  you know another shot knows arrogant know it all but then I also realized that
[35:08.000 --> 35:15.400]  he was trying to get some really nice self-made Christian man who created their
[35:15.400 --> 35:20.280]  own world company and it had become you know multi-billionaires individually and
[35:20.280 --> 35:25.120]  one of the brothers owns the daily wire and then Shapiro runs around and talks
[35:25.120 --> 35:29.280]  about you know how he's this big business Titan and Shapiro couldn't tie
[35:29.280 --> 35:33.920]  his own true license so and I know about all this stuff because I live here in
[35:33.920 --> 35:39.280]  Texas okay and I was gonna leave it at that but my family is all over the state
[35:39.280 --> 35:45.520]  and they know a lot of people and they're in a lot of different businesses and so I
[35:45.520 --> 35:51.080]  start to see Shapiro openly saying that Candace Owens don't come on his show and
[35:51.080 --> 35:56.640]  Kanye West and trying to police me and I realized it was ripe to go after him
[35:56.640 --> 36:00.000]  because here's why he's important he's the next Glenn Beck he's the next
[36:00.000 --> 36:06.120]  Judas go he's the next guy to control the Christian conservative movement just
[36:06.120 --> 36:09.120]  like Glenn Beck went and married a Mormon to get the Mormon money to have the
[36:09.120 --> 36:13.200]  Mormon cred two years before he married that lady he was a shock jock praising
[36:13.200 --> 36:16.760]  abortion calling up other talk show hosts saying I heard your wife had a Miss
[36:16.760 --> 36:22.640]  carriage thank God I mean he was a horrible demon he worked in more than
[36:22.640 --> 36:28.120]  20 markets I know people that know Beck very well he is you give him the wrong
[36:28.120 --> 36:32.520]  pin he screams and yells that you and fires you he's just a monstrous very
[36:32.520 --> 36:40.320]  neurotic person and he believes he's like a Messiah he's also got a lot of
[36:40.320 --> 36:45.240]  foreign money and funding coming in so he bet on the wrong horse I like Ted
[36:45.240 --> 36:49.320]  Cruz Ted Cruz has a good voting record but the whole Texas act and the cowboy
[36:49.320 --> 36:54.360]  boots and you know the holier than thou stuff that's an act too I'm not gonna
[36:54.360 --> 36:58.840]  judge his heart I'm a real Christian but I don't tell you I'm perfect I don't sit
[36:58.840 --> 37:02.600]  up here and tell you how good I pray on Sunday put on the whole mmm good
[37:02.600 --> 37:06.400]  Christian act thing okay I'm ready to die for Christ but I'm definitely a
[37:06.400 --> 37:12.240]  sinner so these guys are waltzing into Texas again just like Beck did and they're
[37:12.240 --> 37:16.120]  all sitting here to get all the Texas oil money to back them and that gets
[37:16.120 --> 37:22.400]  passed through their companies and then the companies fold and so that's what's
[37:22.400 --> 37:27.680]  happening and if you go back to Shapiro and where he comes from and the people
[37:27.680 --> 37:32.600]  he worked for previously and this particular national talk show host who
[37:32.600 --> 37:35.840]  just might decide to go public or might decide to actually talk to Ferris
[37:35.840 --> 37:40.760]  Wilkes and his brother who are good men I know people that know him talk about
[37:40.760 --> 37:44.920]  really upright hard work and self-made men off their masonry company their
[37:44.920 --> 37:48.120]  daddy started and they didn't get into oil till like 15 years ago they've been
[37:48.120 --> 37:51.360]  very successful hard work and diligence they just want to help the country so
[37:51.360 --> 37:54.120]  they're going around trying to finance every libertarian conservative thing they
[37:54.120 --> 37:58.840]  can and then in comes Shapiro the anointed one that Fox News the whole
[37:58.840 --> 38:04.080]  system's pushing and then he's in my business just like Glenn Beck was I
[38:04.080 --> 38:09.680]  told Glenn Beck five years ago on air I said leave me alone and I will leave you
[38:09.680 --> 38:13.720]  alone and for a couple years he did it and then I learned he was behind the
[38:13.720 --> 38:17.800]  scenes doing it again so I went after him again and it was it's it's not hard
[38:17.800 --> 38:23.000]  to go after these people because they're already can't help but sabotage the
[38:23.000 --> 38:28.080]  Christian libertarian movement their judicates their operatives and that's
[38:28.080 --> 38:31.480]  what they do they try to act like they're credible get control of the
[38:31.480 --> 38:34.600]  movement and then steer it into the ground and they try to make sure of the
[38:34.600 --> 38:38.880]  big funds out there go into what they're doing and then they bring on Jordan
[38:38.880 --> 38:45.120]  Peterson who I've been looking at and studying out of nowhere doesn't believe
[38:45.120 --> 38:49.920]  in God but he'll tell you how to wake up and suddenly the Atlantic of the New
[38:49.920 --> 38:53.280]  York Times like Seaman he doesn't get censored and they're all together and
[38:53.280 --> 38:56.680]  they're gonna have a show and they're gonna come and merge with Glenn Beck and
[38:56.680 --> 39:04.560]  how Christian is that to have toward Peterson the atheist the liberals love
[39:04.560 --> 39:08.440]  that Bill Maher loves who explains to us that there are only two genders and we
[39:08.440 --> 39:12.080]  all go oh they let him on here say that this is so original he gives us some
[39:12.080 --> 39:16.720]  Carl Jung passages which is fine and he's a witty guy I think does some good
[39:16.720 --> 39:19.720]  but look at this is going to be the conservative movement this is the new
[39:19.720 --> 39:24.680]  leaders of it not under Christians
[39:26.640 --> 39:31.320]  there's somebody else who wouldn't a Christian but he prays the same God the
[39:31.320 --> 39:36.280]  Old Testament and he would really like to tell you about Shapiro maybe he'll
[39:36.280 --> 39:44.040]  come on maybe it's time for that there's another really big talk show host who's
[39:44.040 --> 39:50.120]  you could say of the same tribe as mr. Shapiro and as a patriot you'd like to
[39:50.120 --> 39:54.340]  tell you about mr. Shapiro because heroes and atheists as well they're not
[39:54.340 --> 39:57.880]  Jews are not Christians are none of it they're establishment individuals in my
[39:57.880 --> 40:03.600]  view and they are now anointed as oh they're underground and now they're all
[40:03.600 --> 40:11.520]  over the system force fed to you but just look at what Shapiro's own people
[40:11.520 --> 40:15.880]  said document cam shot please Ben Shapiro gets an epic Twitter feud with
[40:15.880 --> 40:20.920]  Alex Jones over Kanye West and Candace Owens and it says he destroys Jones with
[40:20.920 --> 40:25.160]  his incredible genius and it's so stunning he using the most sophisticated
[40:25.160 --> 40:29.600]  systems ever seen on earth's superior annihilates Jones then you actually
[40:29.600 --> 40:35.720]  read what the commenters say Jones is supposed supposedly the one unleashing
[40:35.720 --> 40:43.600]  hysterical ad hominems with Shapiro having sharp rational rebuttals in this
[40:43.600 --> 40:54.720]  exchange is he just be supremely foolish to do so because you are a cook well
[40:54.720 --> 40:57.800]  that sounds like a five-year-old wrote it that's what Shapiro said back up by
[40:57.800 --> 41:03.200]  cook cook cupica put up a supremely who you supremely and you're supremely he
[41:03.200 --> 41:08.680]  goes it would be supremely bad to go on cook show you go on cook show welcome to
[41:08.680 --> 41:16.600]  McDonald I am Ben Shapiro may I help you I am the big internet you are cook you
[41:16.600 --> 41:22.800]  are cook okay well that was the rational rebuttal or was it that the dude they
[41:22.800 --> 41:27.680]  shouldn't come on your show because you are awful you couldn't come on the
[41:27.680 --> 41:35.560]  show could be awful I am bit the pillow I thought not or was it the topless photo
[41:35.560 --> 41:39.800]  it's hard to argue with the sharp rational arguments like those he's
[41:39.800 --> 41:44.320]  quoting Shapiro writing in third-party about what a genius he is Shapiro the
[41:44.320 --> 41:49.280]  devastating person with a 5,000 IQ who personally severed Hitler's head and is
[41:49.280 --> 41:54.080]  actually an immortal God the ultimate intellectual the king of earth he will
[41:54.080 --> 41:58.560]  show us Christians in Texas how to do things with Jordan Peterson who explains
[41:58.560 --> 42:02.520]  to us that we're all just animals programmed in the and that he's got a
[42:02.520 --> 42:05.920]  book telling us how to live like robots
[42:06.960 --> 42:12.080]  I'm just shaking and the intellect and in almost every comment and I sort of
[42:12.080 --> 42:16.480]  look at other things on his site they all hating it's just like Glenn Beck they
[42:16.480 --> 42:21.560]  go the anointed one is here here is your God worship him and then he endorses
[42:21.560 --> 42:30.080]  Obama and Hillary it must have been Shapiro's refusal to even debate Jones
[42:30.080 --> 42:34.880]  nothing screams sharp rationalism like refusing debate especially when ones
[42:34.880 --> 42:40.680]  debating skills are routinely highly touted we need to get a certain national
[42:40.680 --> 42:47.000]  talk show host on the phone with the backers of Shapiro I really think these
[42:47.000 --> 42:52.040]  fine Texans could be able to know what they're financing what they're behind
[42:52.040 --> 42:55.280]  and what they're doing but I know Shapiro probably thinks they're a bunch of
[42:55.280 --> 42:59.600]  the self-made country bumpkins let me swoop in there and teach them I will
[42:59.600 --> 43:06.080]  immediately terminate President Obama's illegal executive order on immigration
[43:06.080 --> 43:10.720]  Texas and six other states are suing the Trump administration over its failure to
[43:10.720 --> 43:15.880]  end DACA Adon Salazar reports that Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is leading
[43:15.880 --> 43:20.440]  the multi-state lawsuit which was filed in federal court Tuesday and seeks to
[43:20.440 --> 43:24.120]  put an end to the unconstitutional immigration program which protects
[43:24.120 --> 43:28.920]  many illegals from deportation Paxton said the multi-state coalition lawsuit
[43:28.920 --> 43:33.680]  is about the rule of law not the wisdom of any particular immigration policy
[43:33.680 --> 43:38.080]  the suit faults activists judges for preventing the Trump administration from
[43:38.080 --> 43:42.600]  phasing out DACA as promised according to Paxton this means that unelected
[43:42.600 --> 43:46.560]  federal judges are forcing the Trump administration to leave an unlawful
[43:46.560 --> 43:51.440]  program in place indefinitely as legal challenges drag on adding president
[43:51.440 --> 43:55.680]  Trump has a duty under the Constitution to take care that the law be faithfully

[52:03.200 --> 52:07.880]  how we were funding ISIS in Syria he did the right thing I like Ted Cruz but he
[52:07.880 --> 52:12.880]  linked up with Glenn Beck and he linked up with all and they got all these other
[52:12.880 --> 52:19.200]  Texans to just shell out money see I have my audience supporting us we're the
[52:19.200 --> 52:25.560]  only operation other than Matt Drudge that is self-funded by you the listeners
[52:27.600 --> 52:31.640]  but now I realize if I didn't take the money that other Texas billionaires
[52:31.640 --> 52:37.040]  offered me over the years what do you want Alex 10 million 50 million I'm like
[52:37.040 --> 52:39.880]  well we're just growing here we try to want to fund ourselves you know I don't
[52:39.880 --> 52:43.840]  want to know it's not even a pride thing I just I love the fact that we're
[52:43.840 --> 52:50.120]  self-funded self-made like Shapiro's funders but it's always some person that
[52:50.120 --> 52:56.200]  isn't self-made who's being financed by somebody that is self-made and it's just
[52:56.200 --> 52:58.760]  like Mike Adams said to me off air the other day he said those of us that are
[52:58.760 --> 53:02.840]  self-made should only work with other self-made people because there's
[53:02.840 --> 53:06.400]  something wrong with the people that aren't self-made they always want to
[53:06.400 --> 53:09.520]  hijack they always want to take over what somebody else has got because they
[53:09.520 --> 53:14.880]  don't have it they don't have it Ben Shapiro does it have it like a Michael
[53:14.880 --> 53:18.480]  Savage has it Michael Savage his whole family everything they touch his turns

[53:41.560 --> 53:45.160]  self-made and then you always got the geniuses telling us how to run our
[53:45.160 --> 53:49.560]  lives and academics everybody gonna tell me how to run my life stop telling me

[56:13.320 --> 56:17.040]  medical clinics are they don't sell this stuff in stores because nobody's gonna
[56:17.040 --> 56:20.400]  buy something it costs $300 that's when all their markup they put in it well
[56:20.400 --> 56:26.080]  normally 120 something now 74 95 and there's what is it like 40 something
[56:26.080 --> 56:29.640]  50 something bucks of stuff product in that bottle and then there's the
[56:29.640 --> 56:33.840]  marketing everything else did it nobody sells products like this with a 50 60
[56:33.840 --> 56:38.520]  percent markup that's what it is right now 50% off DNA Force Plus go read all

[59:47.960 --> 01:00:03.880]  revolution you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:13.240]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:35.080]  you're listening to alex jones
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:39.560]  ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us on this thursday
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:46.680]  already the third day of may 2018 worldwide broadcast i am your host alex jones
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:54.760]  and look at the headlines i have here in front of me aren't they interesting wired magazine
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:01:03.000]  5g smartphones cause cancer big wireless doesn't want you to know
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:12.200]  now think about that because i've noticed what they attack me with on mainstream news
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:18.600]  and on the so-called comedy shows jones claims your cell phones are killing you jones claims
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:23.480]  there's chemicals in the water that are lowering your fertility and confusing your sexuality
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:31.320]  jones says there's black helicopters jones says there's a world government
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:39.240]  jones says the eu is unelected it is on and on and on and everything we're saying is out in the
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:48.120]  open so think about how the la times even wired magazine will admit there are thousands of studies
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:55.880]  that prove that wireless radiation as it's intensified in its strength the last 30 years
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:02:03.080]  and in how many places it's emanating from and especially the microwave millimeter waves
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:12.600]  cell phones operate as microwave transmitters and receivers transceivers
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:20.680]  now what's a microwave do it vibrates water vibrates molecules and 5g is in an even more
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:26.840]  powerful form of microwaves that even rattles it faster that's what causes the heat the friction
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:32.440]  of the molecules and burns oxygen and carbon dioxide we're going to cover those studies
[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:36.440]  you heard me right 5g burns the atmosphere
[01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:39.960]  the atmosphere
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:47.800]  5g destroys ozone so they're telling us we're going to destroy ozone but not telling us what
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:56.440]  really does it and then doing it that doesn't sound like something humans would do why are
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:03:00.680]  the globalists doing this why are they changing the atmosphere who are they
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:08.840]  now ladies and gentlemen the question is how do we get people out of their trance
[01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:19.240]  how are we going to do that we're going to talk about that today in the second hour
[01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:27.320]  and lay out mainline studies mainline science that 5g and even the lower four and 3g
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:33.640]  your game boxes a lot of your appliances the smart meters
[01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:43.880]  surveil and dial in to everything digital in your house and steal your data they physically
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:51.560]  listen to you audibly and they watch you not with the conventional iris and a camera visually
[01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:56.360]  but with the millimeter waves the same way a naked body scanner reads you at the airport
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:04:03.720]  it shoots out and reads everything in your house but you invite the little alexa's in you invite
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:08.760]  the little google assistants in there's a big race you know the security companies oh it sits there
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:16.200]  it listens to you it watches it cares and a lot of them kick on when there's burglaries or the
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:20.520]  sounds of people being upset or they call the police for you you know there's certainly a good
[01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:28.680]  side to the double edge but it was designed as a trojan horse so we're going to cover it
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:35.480]  all today and black helicopters terrified the public in a major city of new jersey with explosions
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:39.240]  and machine gun fire on purpose we'll explain the story behind the story and have the powerful
[01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:45.560]  video coming up and then we have so much more that we're going to be looking at uh here today
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:51.720]  that is absolutely critical the latest on kanye west and so much more i'm alex shones with info wars

[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:15.320]  behavioral disorders a lot of the autism spectrum disorders are in the gut from the diets and
[01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:22.120]  vaccines that trigger autoimmune responses in the stomach that then create major toxicity in the gut

[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:41.160]  bizarre uh state-run education programs in this country shocking information uh looking at organized
[01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:47.160]  cover-up of uh abusive students at the highest levels so we're going to be looking at that shocking
[01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:53.400]  video and talking to james o kief we're going to have dr group in studio to break down the
[01:06:53.400 --> 01:07:00.600]  mainline medical science that 5g and even below is massively increasing cancer and it's currently
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:07.160]  it's estimated in mainline science will go over killing more people than cigarettes you heard me
[01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:13.080]  right and they're only upping the power and we'll go into why they want this system now it's being
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:20.200]  used as a system to kill fertility but oprah wimfrey ted turner bill gates and others warren
[01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:25.880]  buffet meet each year to discuss a planetary world government plan to covertly reduce world
[01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:30.680]  population six years ago they when i had admitted they do meet with that plan in fact you can just
[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:37.320]  type that in uh bill gates oprah wimfrey and others meet to discuss world depopulation
[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:43.560]  you might want to read it because it's going on right now and the 5g and the atrazine and all of
[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:50.280]  now i've always noticed what is it they don't want me to talk about they don't want me to ever talk about
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:59.160]  about islam taking over they don't want me to talk about atrazine and chemicals reducing
[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:05.400]  fertility and they don't want me talking about cell phone radiation causing cancer but also causing
[01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:11.480]  heart problems mental illness you name it in all the major studies and now they're going to mount
[01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:20.200]  well beyond 5g high powered microwave transmitters on the bottoms of quote all major commercial
[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:28.120]  aircraft you see the tv ads on fox running for this so quote you'll have wi-fi all over the country

[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:17.160]  on cobear and the hbo shows and the showtime shows the homeland shows and it was even in the news
[01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:21.880]  last week they said homeland all the other big media outlets netflix all of them go they rotate
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:29.160]  out a week each of the year and they meet at lane lee virginia at the cia and they learn what they're
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:35.800]  supposed to say and they're supposed to say alex jones is bad cell phone radiation doesn't hurt you
[01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:41.080]  vaccines never hurt you there's no geo engineering going on even though it's all declassified
[01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:46.120]  admitted and there's no world government and everything's fine and the sperm counts aren't
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:52.600]  down 87 and depression isn't massively up in the youth of course it all is and there's again
[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:57.960]  everything's fine and oh it also remember the old one i remember i was first on air 23 years ago
[01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:02.360]  and it would be in soldier of fortune or it would be in a local newspaper that
[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:08.840]  at 14 black helicopters as they were described showed up and then attack the old school that
[01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:12.280]  was scheduled for demolition the next month shedding it on fire
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:17.640]  three people at the old folks homes had heart attacks
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:23.000]  and i would i was decompartmentalizing news i didn't realize what i was doing at the time
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:27.480]  but i would take some local story from south texas or a story that somebody mailed me from
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:32.920]  indiana or people mailed me vhs tapes as i was on local radio but used that to syndicate out on
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:38.760]  the satellite and i was on i don't like 15 radio stations even by 1996 or so and global shortwave
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:44.120]  and satellite and the k-band people had on their houses then a lot of them still do
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:47.240]  sort of audience of people that cared that were looking for the truth and they were the ones
[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:51.560]  that educated me i was just a mainline libertarian kind of conservative knew a lot of history but
[01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:58.200]  didn't get get the big picture they educated me real fast and so i would play on the radio
[01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:08.120]  clips of local news about you know foreign troops with the army and blowing up buildings and no one
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:15.880]  was told i'd play it and they would have the state police write an article for the austin american
[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:24.680]  statesman saying jones is insane jones is dangerous uh none of this exists and they put on the front
[01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:30.680]  page of the paper and i would have been the san antonio police chief on i'd have the austin
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:35.320]  police i'd talk to them i'd have the emergency manager kingsville on they would they would
[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:40.360]  detail how it was the delta force and how they were there with with uh check republic and german
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:45.160]  troops and and i wasn't even attacking the military but they'd say jones is attacking our military
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:50.520]  and doesn't want you to trust him and then they would do these pre training deals where they
[01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:58.040]  sometimes they would warn them they'd knock on doors and say alex jones hates america and he may
[01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:02.360]  be coming to talk to you when he comes don't talk to him this is in my films police state one police
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:07.480]  state two and i had the locals going yeah the army colonel came by yesterday and said don't talk to
[01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:13.000]  you you're an enemy i don't think you're an enemy then they came and it was scary and i know who you
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:18.200]  are and they you i heard you a year ago say this and then they came and they was blowing it up over
[01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:30.840]  there so so it became this big challenge for me because the news nationally would say there are no
[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:36.360]  black helicopters it's not happening and i didn't even know what was going on now i know it was a
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:41.560]  psi op to train the public that a martial law ever came in when they came in to take out the local
[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:47.960]  government they've ordered by bill clinton who was preparing this he was testing it that they wanted
[01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:55.000]  the locals to lay down during the assault and that's why every major town in the u.s has had multiple
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:06.440]  army air force marines you name it invasions most of them unannounced is so that when they
[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:12.440]  decide to really hit you you don't know what hit you and again the military is later how i learned
[01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:19.560]  about this the san antonio police chief was in army intelligence uh the head of emergency management
[01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:26.040]  in kingsville he was in secret operations in the army so if they knew what it was about and the word
[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:29.800]  was bill clinton because they were finally told by dealt the force that they didn't like it and they
[01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:35.800]  apologized in kingsville and then later in austin they went ahead and told us head of the swat team
[01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:41.080]  and they fire the travis county head once he told me they said look we apologize this is a pdd gun
[01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:47.480]  confiscation martial law drill in case state houses or any county stand up during a un takeover and
[01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:52.280]  we now know that's all real uh loretta lynch wanted it the strong cities initiative they wanted to
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:57.800]  cause a race war then have the un come in and put departments under the un that was in the local paper
[01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:03.640]  here so i would cover all this because i had police chiefs and emergency managers telling me and the
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:08.120]  delta force had told them they didn't like it but bill clinton was telling them and man they got
[01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:12.600]  pissed i mean they had the guys come and physically attack me all sorts of stuff i'm not going to get
[01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:17.560]  into on air but the point is that i got the message you better shut up but that was from
[01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:29.480]  clinton goons not the military now what just hit last night this is cbslocal.com new york
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:34.680]  department of defense training exercise terrifies unprepared new jersey residents
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:40.680]  it all started off as a well-kept secret that the explosives and helicopters ended up giving it away
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:43.880]  members of the u.s. department of defense were conducting training recently in new jersey
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:49.640]  neighborhood and the result was plenty of residents with frayed nerves dick brevin reported for cbs
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:55.960]  channel two other cities su defense department and then uh over gun check reporting or another one
[01:14:55.960 --> 01:15:01.800]  cell phone video captured the moment we'll roll some of that guys a helicopter flew above there
[01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:05.960]  were its excitement and the photographer's voice but that's because the video was taken
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:11.400]  on the second night of action they didn't warn them the first night residents say they never
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:16.440]  seen anything like it before now here's the deal now they admit this and it's being done now for
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:22.840]  different reasons but cng terrorism training but the overall mission was to acclimate us
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:29.800]  and so it was huge under clinton some happened under bush came back under obama is still continuing
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:35.240]  and i'll get into what's behind it but remember remember that didn't exist remember you were
[01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:39.800]  insane remember the black helicopter people and oh they're crazy and oh they say they saw
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:44.280]  you'd be out of the middle of alabama there'd be a marine core checkpoint searching people
[01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:49.640]  when we get the video and they go jones is crazy there were no marines searching vehicles here
[01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:55.320]  and so this is all part of the acclamation and again another thing where you get decades of news

[01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:28.040]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well so does he lie
[01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:36.920]  from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones well everyone in 2018 knows that your town your
[01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:45.240]  city has had an unannounced 8 to 14 to 20 plus black helicopters they're painted black with
[01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:53.880]  paint that helps absorb radar waves not your classic deep army green you've all experienced
[01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:59.640]  the night stalkers out of Fort Campbell Kentucky deliver army personnel
[01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:07.880]  for training to operate in the united states it's to acclimate them it's to acclimate you
[01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:14.440]  but just remember in the early 1990s when the activity was i've got to say
[01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:22.760]  hundreds of times what it is now i mean it was black helicopters hitting towns every couple
[01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:30.040]  days it was a major massive operation under bill clinton that started about 94 and it was to train
[01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:42.440]  everybody to accept wake up type attacks on churches on city halls on state houses that
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:49.720]  was usually too obvious to hit a capital so they would hit courthouses and you've seen federal
[01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:54.680]  judges and state judges even texas come out and say under obama remember a few years ago they said
[01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:59.320]  of gun confiscation begins and they bring in un troops we're going to have to get armor personnel
[01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:03.640]  carriers for the sheriff's department to fight it people thought man that's crazy but the national
[01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:10.280]  media barely picked it up when state judges and others said that because they'd been briefed
[01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:16.360]  the ephema on the plan that was what four years ago they had a couple big judges come out
[01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:20.600]  and then a year later loretta lynch goes we're going to have the un run local departments
[01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:24.600]  if there's a race war and now we have the documents they were trying to start one
[01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:29.800]  i mean i used to hear this from our military sources and i thought they were messing with us
[01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:35.720]  i would say sources say 20 years ago now the plan is public
[01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:40.840]  you can see my films free online police state one police state two police state three
[01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:52.360]  police state four they all have the the black helicopters the local police the the the marine
[01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:57.080]  corps checkpoints the army took over the role of taking over local government
[01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:03.240]  at hitting first you think the marines would hit first but it was usually army training
[01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:07.720]  to hit first marines would then come in and take control of the population and process people
[01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:12.920]  i mean it's just incredible ladies and gentlemen
[01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:23.080]  we're americans we deserve you help us no don't take our guns go see the video
[01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:28.600]  and the national news when this came out seeing an inplayed clips
[01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:36.200]  in the mid 90s and said alex jones is a liar he hired fake marines they said the footage
[01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:41.880]  you're watching of your tv viewer is fake hovercraft landing the coronata amphibious ship
[01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:50.520]  landing they claimed i faked it now that's how dumb they think you are the atrazine
[01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:59.080]  didn't sterilize in you and and turning mammals amphibians into asexual hemathridites yes it's
[01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:05.480]  all admitted thousands of studies 5g totally giving you massive cancer brain tumors already
[01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:11.000]  doubled the last decade journal of medicine just showed you the article earlier
[01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:20.360]  pass aside atrazine and turn male frogs into females boom berkeley science department you see
[01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:28.200]  berkeley tyron haze professor of integrative biology but it doesn't matter looking down his nose
[01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:36.120]  ben Shapiro the unmade man none of these so-called fake conservatives can
[01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:39.800]  ever launch a company they've always got billionaires financing them which isn't a bad thing but
[01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:45.320]  we're the only outfit self-made no one else in media except matt drudge is self-made no one matt
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:50.120]  drudge and info wars at this level no one else matt drudge and info wars that's it
[01:24:50.120 --> 01:25:00.200]  now think about that they say ben Shapiro is buying the blaze no texas billionaires
[01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:05.640]  that he's carpet bagged down here to get are trying to do it i think i'm going to call those
[01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:08.600]  billionaires and warn those guys i know years ago i've had a lot of people contact me and
[01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:13.000]  never got back because i'm a i'm i'm funding my own operation here that's my mission but
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:17.800]  if Shapiro really wants to get in my business down here in texas try to move down here we
[01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:24.200]  aren't exposed back as a fake he's out of business he's pretty much closed shop
[01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:29.240]  and you go reach Shapiro's website almost every comment can't stand him and hates him because
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:33.640]  it's this whole act of how he's intellectual and he's this genius and he's this wizard and
[01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:36.920]  he knows everything and then almost every comment i'm going to show you later hate his guts
[01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:42.760]  and say oh you're so intellectual you use terms like alex is awful
[01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:50.040]  and of course won't debate me and why am i mad because glenn bett got in my business with radio

[01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:08.200]  second time in the five and a half year history of survival shield x2 our flagship product we are
[01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:14.200]  having supply chain problems and this may be the last batch of this we have deep earth crystal
[01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:19.640]  source that's so pure that it actually turns into purple gas in the atmosphere and so in our
[01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:25.640]  own search to get the purest form we discovered that oil companies and gas drilling companies had
[01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:30.120]  a byproduct that they were selling to pharmaceutical companies and also drug makers they used to make
[01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:36.440]  drugs and once they figure out there's a market they start jacking up the price but we're offering
[01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:41.480]  it still 25 off until it sells out hopefully just like the last time this happened a few years ago
[01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:46.760]  it's not an issue and we do get more but right now we are not able to secure the crystals that
[01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:53.320]  produce the purest iodine in the world but what it does is for stamina libido focus energy is really

[01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:18.120]  sinus passageways eye comfort and respiratory functions in the 1960s researchers in france
[01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:23.480]  noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory
[01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:29.080]  responses they began studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have
[01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:34.600]  the fruit of this research a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:41.080]  symptoms pollen block is natural and effective it is not an antihistamine in fact current research
[01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:46.120]  is found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that
[01:31:46.120 --> 01:31:52.440]  amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body go outside and enjoy the air you breathe

[01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:09.720]  about for decades that a lot of the mental disorders a lot of the behavioral disorders a lot of the
[01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:16.680]  autism spectrum disorders are in the gut from the diets and vaccines that trigger autoimmune
[01:32:16.680 --> 01:32:23.080]  responses in the stomach that then create major toxicity in the gut causing toxicity in the brain

[01:32:54.680 --> 01:33:03.720]  live dot com you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:10.760]  so
[01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:27.560]  you found the front lines of the human awakening it's the info war and now alex jones
[01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:33.480]  so over the years i've had a lot of texas oil people contact me
[01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:39.880]  and want to try to help info wars and i've never done it because i want to self fund
[01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:45.400]  their operation and i have that as an ace in the hole um you know a lot of people that i can go to
[01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:50.440]  if i needed a lot of money that's why the whole soros hillary plan where they're in the news on
[01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:54.680]  mbc news saying they plan to shut me down they admit the democratic parties behind it that's why
[01:33:54.680 --> 01:33:59.240]  why we don't want to go down that route but we're going to win one way or another with our
[01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:03.240]  listeners supporting us with us putting it all into the fight expanding on the tv stations
[01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:07.000]  across the country the broadcast is exploding and i'm going to get into all the other big world
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:14.200]  news but the reason i'm attacking ben shapiro is he wasn't ripe enough when i heard about him
[01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:19.640]  years ago from one of the top talk show hosts of the country and just look out for this guy
[01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:23.960]  he's as bad as it gets i just heard from that national talk show host during the break
[01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:29.720]  we're talking one of the top three names and i was warned about him and i just ignore it because
[01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:37.240]  i try to be a team player and then i noticed shapiro behind the scenes causing his problems and
[01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:41.720]  then also reaching out to people in a whisper campaign saying don't be associated with info wars
[01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:47.080]  just like cnn and msnbc and george soros and all them are doing and i just ignore it and move on
[01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:52.760]  because the guy just comes off so arrogant and then you know he he has his own website that talks
[01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:58.520]  about what a genius he is all day and his own readers are just sick of it you know another
[01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:06.760]  snot knows arrogant know it all but then i also realized that he was trying to get
[01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:15.560]  some really nice self-made christian uh man who created their own world company and it become
[01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:20.280]  you know multi-billionaires uh individually and one of the brothers owns the daily wire
[01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:24.920]  and then shapiro runs around and talks about you know how he's this big business titan
[01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:31.240]  and shapiro couldn't tie his own true license show and i know about all this stuff because
[01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:37.160]  i live here in texas okay and i was gonna leave it at that but my family is all over the state and
[01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:45.640]  they know a lot of people and they're in a lot of different businesses and so i start to see
[01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:50.360]  shapiro openly saying that Candace Owens don't come on his show and Kanye West and trying to
[01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:56.680]  police me and i realized it was ripe to go after him because here's why he's important he's the next
[01:35:56.680 --> 01:36:01.480]  glenn beck he's the next judicago he's the next guy to control the christian conservative movement
[01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:07.880]  just like glenn beck went and married a Mormon to get the Mormon money to have the Mormon cred
[01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:12.520]  two years before he married that lady he was a shock jock praising abortion calling up other
[01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:17.640]  talk show hosts saying i heard your wife had a miscarriage thank god i mean he was a horrible demon
[01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:25.720]  he worked in more than 20 markets i know people that know beck very well he is you give him the
[01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:32.280]  wrong pin he screams and yells at you and fires you he's just a monstrous very neurotic person
[01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:39.960]  and he believes he's like a messiah he's also got a lot of foreign money and funding coming in
[01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:44.680]  so he bet on the wrong horse i like Ted Cruz Ted Cruz has a good voting record
[01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:50.840]  but the whole texas act and the cowboy boots and you know the holier than thou stuff that's an act
[01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:56.440]  too i'm not going to judge his heart i'm a real christian but i don't tell you i'm perfect i don't
[01:36:56.440 --> 01:37:01.400]  sit up here and tell you how good i pray on sunday and put on the whole mmm good christian act thing
[01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:07.640]  okay i'm ready to die for christ but i'm definitely a sinner so these guys are waltzing into texas
[01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:12.440]  again just like beck did and they're all sitting here to get all the texas oil money to back them
[01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:17.160]  and that gets passed through their companies and then the companies fold
[01:37:19.480 --> 01:37:24.760]  and so that's what's happening and if you go back to Shapiro and where he comes from
[01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:30.680]  and and the people he worked for previously and this particular national talk show hosts who just
[01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:36.040]  might decide to go public or might decide to actually talk to ferris wilks and his brother
[01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:40.600]  who are good men i know people that know him talk about really upright hard work and self-made men
[01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:45.560]  off their masonry company their daddy started and then you get into oil till like 15 years ago
[01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:48.920]  they've been very successful with hard work and diligence they just want to help the country
[01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:52.200]  so they're going around trying to finance every libertarian conservative thing they can
[01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:57.480]  and then in comes Shapiro the anointed one that fox news the whole system's pushing
[01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:03.640]  and then he's in my business just like glenn beck was i told glenn beck five years ago on there
[01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:10.840]  i said leave me alone and i will leave you alone and for a couple years he did it and then i learned
[01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:16.120]  he was behind the scenes doing it again so i went after him again and it's it's it's not hard to go
[01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:21.560]  after these people because they're already can't help but sabotage the christian libertarian
[01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:28.040]  movement they're judicates they're operatives and that's what they do they try to act like
[01:38:28.040 --> 01:38:31.960]  they're credible get control of the movement and then steer it into the ground and they try to make
[01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:37.160]  sure of the big funds out there go into what they're doing and then they bring on jordan peterson
[01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:45.720]  who i've been looking at and studying out of nowhere doesn't believe in god but he'll tell you
[01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:49.960]  how to wake up and suddenly the atlantic of the new york times like seaman he doesn't get censored
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:54.040]  and they're all together and they're gonna have a show and they're gonna come in merge with glenn
[01:38:54.040 --> 01:39:02.920]  beckon how christian is that to have torden peterson the atheist that the liberals love that bill
[01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:07.560]  mar loves who explains to us that they're only two genders and we all go oh they let him on here
[01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:13.640]  say that this is so original he gives us some carl yung passages which is fine and he's a witty guy
[01:39:13.640 --> 01:39:17.640]  i think does some good but look at this is going to be the conservative movement this is the new
[01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:27.080]  leaders of it none of them are christians there's somebody else who wasn't a christian but he
[01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:33.640]  prays the same god the whole testament and he would really like to tell you about Shapiro
[01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:38.840]  maybe he'll come on maybe it's time for that there's another really big talk show host
[01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:48.200]  who's you could say of the same tribe as mr. Shapiro and as a patriot he'd like to tell you
[01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:53.400]  about mr. Shapiro because pyros and atheists as well they're not jews they're not christians
[01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:59.960]  or none of it they're establishment individuals in my view and they are now anointed as oh
[01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:03.480]  they're underground and now they're all over the system force fed to you
[01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:11.400]  you but just look at what Shapiro's own people said document cam shot please
[01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:15.080]  ben Shapiro gets an epic twitter feud with alec jones over kanye west
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:21.560]  and kandace owens and it says he destroys jones with his incredible genius and it's so stunning
[01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:26.040]  he's using the most sophisticated systems ever seen on earth so pyro annihilates jones
[01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:33.400]  then you actually read what the commenters say jones is supposed supposedly the one unleashing
[01:40:34.040 --> 01:40:38.600]  hysterical ad homonyms with Shapiro having sharp rational rebuttals
[01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:45.000]  in this exchange is he just
[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:53.720]  be supremely foolish to do so because you are a kook well that sounds like a five year old
[01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:59.160]  brother that's what Shapiro said backed up by kook kook kopee kopee supremely oh you're
[01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:04.280]  supremely i mean you're supremely he goes it would be supremely bad to go on kook show
[01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:11.720]  you go on kook show welcome to mcdonald i am ben Shapiro may i help you i am the big internet
[01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:19.720]  um um you are kook you are kook okay well that was the rational rebuttal or was it the the dude
[01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:26.200]  dude they shouldn't come on your show because you are awful you couldn't come on the thought
[01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:34.200]  because they're awful i am ben Shapiro i feel smart or was it the topless photo it's hard
[01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:40.440]  to argue with the sharp rational arguments like those he's quoting Shapiro writing in third party
[01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:45.720]  about what a genius he is Shapiro the devastating person with a 5000 IQ who personally severed
[01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:51.560]  Hitler's head and is actually an immortal god the ultimate intellectual the king of earth
[01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:56.680]  he will show us christians in texas how to do things with jordan peterson who explains to us
[01:41:56.680 --> 01:42:01.400]  that we're all just animals programmed and uh and and and he's got a book telling us how to live like
[01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:09.800]  robots oh i'm just i'm just shaking and the intellect and in almost every comment and i sort
[01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:14.680]  of look at other things on his site they all hating it's just like glenn back they go the
[01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:20.760]  anointed one is here here is your god worship him and then he endorses obama and hillary
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:29.240]  it must have been Shapiro's refusal to even debate jones nothing screams sharp
[01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:35.480]  rationalism like refusing to debate especially when ones debating skills are routinely highly
[01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:43.480]  touted we need to get a certain national talk show host on the phone with the backers of Shapiro
[01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:49.560]  i i really think these fine texans should be able to know what they're financing what they're
[01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:53.240]  behind and what they're doing because i know Shapiro probably thinks they're a bunch of the
[01:42:53.240 --> 01:42:59.960]  self-made country bumpkins let me swoop in there and teach them i will immediately terminate president

[01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:12.280]  administration over its failure to end DACA adan salazar reports that texas attorney general
[01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:17.880]  ken paxton is leading the multi-state lawsuit which was filed in federal court tuesday and
[01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:22.760]  seeks to put an end to the unconstitutional immigration program which protects many illegals
[01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:28.600]  from deportation paxton said the multi-state coalition lawsuit is about the rule of law
[01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:34.120]  not the wisdom of any particular immigration policy the suit faults activists judges for
[01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:39.320]  preventing the trump administration from phasing out DACA as promised according to paxton this
[01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:44.680]  means that unelected federal judges are forcing the trump administration to leave an unlawful
[01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:50.600]  program in place indefinitely as legal challenges drag on adding president trump has a duty under
[01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:56.440]  the constitution to take care that the law be faithfully executed leon macadoo info wars dot com

[01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:28.200]  something bucks of stuff product in that bottle and then there's the marketing or anything else
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:35.160]  nobody sells products like this with a 50 60 markup that's what it is right now 50 off dna

[02:00:08.520 --> 02:00:13.880]  notice the media doesn't want to attack us on this issue because they all know it's true
[02:00:14.520 --> 02:00:18.440]  and we were talking about how these big high rise buildings are just these giant antennas with all
[02:00:18.440 --> 02:00:24.600]  the wi-fi all the 4g 3g 5g it's just insane and when i lived in a high rise during my
[02:00:24.600 --> 02:00:28.680]  divorce year and a half i couldn't sleep it was terrible uh you know now you're out in the country
[02:00:28.680 --> 02:00:33.720]  or big bend you feel so good you can think so good all the studies show these manipulate brain waves
[02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:37.640]  even if they're not trying to manipulate our brain waves it's causing major major problems we're
[02:00:37.640 --> 02:00:42.280]  going to break her in a few minutes and bring in project veritas uh with uh james oakie with
[02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:47.480]  huge breaking news but just finishing up here is wired magazine you know admitting that it's giving
[02:00:47.480 --> 02:00:54.040]  people brain cancer uh i mean it's it's all here 5g smartphones cause brain cancer big
[02:00:54.040 --> 02:00:58.840]  wireless doesn't want you to know and you pull back from this is why i'm not scared of george
[02:00:58.840 --> 02:01:03.000]  soros or hillary sill and us are going after james oakie for anybody because we're in a total war
[02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:07.480]  either these corporations know what they're doing or they're totally insane because they've
[02:01:07.480 --> 02:01:12.120]  always known this they're upping the power and you're making some great points just to finish up
[02:01:12.920 --> 02:01:17.080]  what you were saying dr group well i was saying that bill clinton's the one that signed the telecom
[02:01:17.080 --> 02:01:23.320]  act and obama just signed the brain initiative project a couple years ago so they know what's
[02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:30.120]  going on and it's already look look at society today and you know you talk about population control
[02:01:30.120 --> 02:01:37.400]  so the men are infertile and the women are infertile now just because of all of these things
[02:01:37.400 --> 02:01:44.520]  that are happening the electromagnetic frequencies harden the eggs inside of the female and the
[02:01:44.520 --> 02:01:48.120]  fluoride and all the endocrine disrupting chemicals that are feminizing all the males
[02:01:48.120 --> 02:01:52.520]  are ruining the sperm and we have mainstream articles it what happens to an egg that gets
[02:01:52.520 --> 02:01:57.800]  cooked it gets hard boiled they're cooked the eggs are literally cooked i mean young girls now
[02:01:57.800 --> 02:02:02.360]  they're they're finding that their eggs are just all cooked together they're just hard so what does
[02:02:02.360 --> 02:02:07.640]  that mean if the women don't have any viable eggs and the men don't have any viable sperm you've
[02:02:07.640 --> 02:02:13.480]  already accomplished population control the way they want to control it is now how do you fertilize
[02:02:13.480 --> 02:02:19.320]  a hardened egg you have to do it through ivf you have to get a male sperm and you have to inject
[02:02:19.320 --> 02:02:24.200]  the needle through that hardened layer and you have to inject sperm into it so it takes control
[02:02:24.200 --> 02:02:31.080]  the whole reproductive process the whole reproductive system and the population and if you're not a
[02:02:31.080 --> 02:02:35.240]  good person if you're not you know if you're a free thinker or you're anything like like that i mean
[02:02:35.240 --> 02:02:39.960]  they can control well it's just like monsanto said 20 years ago national geographic we want to take
[02:02:39.960 --> 02:02:44.440]  control the whole biological workings of the planet and make it where no seeds produce the plan
[02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:49.400]  you have to come to us this is a total takeover listen they're all they already have technology
[02:02:49.400 --> 02:02:54.280]  right now that darpa's been working on where they can read your thoughts and they can they they can
[02:02:54.280 --> 02:03:00.760]  come or their plan is to come arrest you when you think about robbing the store two hours that was
[02:03:00.760 --> 02:03:05.480]  in the associated press a month ago listeners didn't believe it when i read it yes that's i
[02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:11.240]  have evidence of that in this documentation yes they wanted that as crime prevention they can
[02:03:11.240 --> 02:03:18.520]  and they can punish you for thinking about creating a crime and that and they just claim
[02:03:18.520 --> 02:03:22.680]  that they know it's a great now facebook's ask you and you want to merge your thought patterns
[02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:27.400]  with this cyborg type you know these brain implants so that you become this half human
[02:03:27.400 --> 02:03:32.040]  transhumanism this is talking about transhumanism for like 15 years this is thousands of times
[02:03:32.040 --> 02:03:36.040]  bigger than the manhattan project and if you read with the transhumanist julien huxley said all
[02:03:36.040 --> 02:03:42.760]  his huxley's brother in the 60s he said we're going to start with trans men to women women to men
[02:03:42.760 --> 02:03:46.920]  we're going to make it illegal to criticize it and then all these hybrids all these clones all
[02:03:46.920 --> 02:03:52.840]  these cross species it'll be the law you can't even talk about it the good news is iodine selenium

[02:04:43.080 --> 02:04:48.200]  way that's weird they have embedded propaganda and shows you know like better call solvers brother's
[02:04:48.200 --> 02:04:51.960]  crazy and thinks that but you have all the documents all the un documents the associated

[02:05:02.200 --> 02:05:07.640]  on immigration texas and six other states are suing the trump administration over its failure to
[02:05:07.640 --> 02:05:13.480]  end DACA adan salazar reports that texas attorney general ken paxton is leading the multi-state
[02:05:13.480 --> 02:05:19.080]  lawsuit which was filed in federal court tuesday and seeks to put an end to the unconstitutional
[02:05:19.080 --> 02:05:24.600]  immigration program which protects many illegals from deportation paxton said the multi-state
[02:05:24.600 --> 02:05:30.840]  coalition lawsuit is about the rule of law not the wisdom of any particular immigration policy
[02:05:30.840 --> 02:05:35.880]  the suit faults activists judges for preventing the trump administration from phasing out DACA
[02:05:35.880 --> 02:05:41.160]  as promised according to paxton this means that unelected federal judges are forcing the
[02:05:41.160 --> 02:05:47.400]  trump administration to leave an unlawful program in place indefinitely as legal challenges drag on
[02:05:47.400 --> 02:05:52.760]  adding president trump has a duty under the constitution to take care of the law be faithfully
[02:05:52.760 --> 02:06:12.760]  executed leon macadoo info wars dot com waging war on corruption it's alex jones
[02:06:15.160 --> 02:06:20.360]  well the one the only james ok for project veritas is just here with us for two segments
[02:06:20.360 --> 02:06:26.840]  he's got a major new coup exposing these wild department of education uh operations in the
[02:06:26.840 --> 02:06:32.040]  unions around the country uh just just unbelievable he's got hours of new raw video at the project
[02:06:32.040 --> 02:06:36.840]  veritas uh dot com we're going to play a little bit of an excerpt of it in a moment it's up on
[02:06:36.840 --> 02:06:42.120]  info wars dot com but i think it's best james if you introduce what uh happened here this individual
[02:06:42.120 --> 02:06:48.200]  has now been basically kicked out but but just break down what people are about to see well alex
[02:06:48.200 --> 02:06:54.280]  thanks for having me on again this is a pretty uh shocking expose or it confirms suspicions about
[02:06:54.280 --> 02:07:00.280]  leadership and education what you're about to see are are two presidents of the teachers union one
[02:07:00.280 --> 02:07:05.720]  guy named dav parry in near trent new jersey another named cathleen valencia in union city
[02:07:05.720 --> 02:07:10.920]  new jersey and they're talking about covering up child abusers in the in the public schools
[02:07:10.920 --> 02:07:16.520]  a dav parry the statements he makes are so shocking he actually says we want to turn it back around
[02:07:16.520 --> 02:07:22.440]  onto the child he says it's my job he says i'm going to backdate it that's commit fraud after
[02:07:22.440 --> 02:07:27.000]  the incident of abuse he says that's his job at the teachers union he's there to protect
[02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:31.800]  the worst people he's there to bend the truth and he's there to reverse it back onto the kid
[02:07:31.800 --> 02:07:38.760]  there's me confronting dav parry uh who denied the things he said now last night alex the national
[02:07:38.760 --> 02:07:44.840]  education association and the nj ea that's the new jersey version of it has suspended him so they've
[02:07:44.840 --> 02:07:51.480]  suspended one union president and then just today alex we released another woman in new jersey
[02:07:51.480 --> 02:07:56.360]  saying that she was protecting child abuse and what's incredible here is of the hundreds of
[02:07:56.360 --> 02:08:03.240]  incredible exploits for america you engaged in uh exposing acorn all of it exposing election
[02:08:03.240 --> 02:08:07.800]  fraud of the democrats when you watch mainstream news act like you're a devil you're a criminal
[02:08:07.800 --> 02:08:12.360]  you're an evil person because once you try to sneak in undercover somewhere you mean you deserve a
[02:08:12.360 --> 02:08:16.120]  medal of honor in my view for what you've done for the republic they're definitely coming after
[02:08:16.120 --> 02:08:20.600]  you death-threading you you know you name it uh it's just incredible that time after time whether
[02:08:20.600 --> 02:08:25.000]  you caught youtube saying your number one job is to ban info wars or any of this is that they're
[02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:31.960]  so brazen they act like classical villains uh out of an old black and white movie or like a cartoon
[02:08:33.080 --> 02:08:38.600]  yeah alex i think there's three stages of the truth the first is to ridicule the messenger the
[02:08:38.600 --> 02:08:45.000]  second is to viciously attack the messenger and the third is that the truth becomes self-evident
[02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:51.080]  and and and the arc of the moral universe is long but it sure bends this these tapes are so i mean
[02:08:51.080 --> 02:08:57.720]  it is you couldn't write a caricature of a of a union boss mobster if you look at the video these
[02:08:57.720 --> 02:09:02.920]  guys are saying things that you couldn't script i mean it's the woman today valencia was her name
[02:09:02.920 --> 02:09:08.600]  she says that that there's this guy who had sex with a teenage girl and that they're going to cover
[02:09:08.600 --> 02:09:13.720]  it up and no one's going to jail and she waves the documents in front of the camera so it's the
[02:09:13.720 --> 02:09:18.680]  good news is alex even the mainstream media in in new york and new jersey this is kind of a statewide
[02:09:18.680 --> 02:09:23.560]  story over the last 24 hours they even them have not been able to defend what you're seeing on tape
[02:09:23.560 --> 02:09:27.720]  but because these union officials have never been asked a difficult question in their lives they've
[02:09:27.720 --> 02:09:33.400]  never been held accountable it's it's like very low hanging fruit and we have a lot more to come
[02:09:33.400 --> 02:09:37.240]  we're going to play the individual from illinois first and we're going to go to break you'll do a
[02:09:37.240 --> 02:09:40.840]  few more minutes and you're going to leave us i'll play the lady that you just exposed we'll
[02:09:40.840 --> 02:09:45.160]  talk more about that in the next segment but again this is the individual this is what the
[02:09:45.160 --> 02:09:51.000]  teachers union had in in a major township of illinois correct uh this is in hamilton township
[02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:57.000]  which is near trenton new jersey new jersey he's the president of his chapter he's a leader he has
[02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:03.560]  a phd as a doctor and watch what he says okay here it is dr perry how do you justify having a job
[02:10:04.120 --> 02:10:11.320]  where you protect teachers you're on hidden camera sir you're on hidden camera talking about uh
[02:10:11.320 --> 02:10:18.520]  protecting teachers review students okay dr perry locked the door we cannot get in uh hi

[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:33.960]  to you all right and and do you know the video of yourself talking to the person who said you already
[02:10:33.960 --> 02:10:38.040]  knew that person we know they were coming in because they came in the next day so you said you
[02:10:38.040 --> 02:10:43.800]  protected a teacher who had shoplifted yeah we'd like to see yourself on video i said what we do
[02:10:43.800 --> 02:10:48.680]  is we help people we help people and what they do wrong they deserve the punishment what does
[02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:54.520]  you mean by bend the truth okay so we just talked to david perry we're outside the hamilton township
[02:10:54.520 --> 02:11:00.360]  education association in new jersey uh he denied saying what he said but we have the tape but i don't
[02:11:00.360 --> 02:11:05.400]  want him coming here with a bunch of lies i need another truth so that we can bend the truth okay
[02:11:05.400 --> 02:11:11.160]  i'm not here to hurt anybody i'm here to defend no matter the the worst teachers in the world
[02:11:11.160 --> 02:11:16.920]  i have defended well yeah i mean it was like a physical it was bad yeah like a physical
[02:11:17.560 --> 02:11:23.720]  garbage if he comes to me tomorrow i'm gonna date it back to the day after the incident
[02:11:24.280 --> 02:11:29.480]  okay he was upset he was worried he did shake the kid so if they said there was bruises he had
[02:11:29.480 --> 02:11:33.880]  there was bruises where i gotta ask him where he where he hit him and i said yeah because he was
[02:11:33.880 --> 02:11:37.880]  trying to put him back in the seat because he was getting physical and he was telling we reverse it
[02:11:37.880 --> 02:11:43.720]  onto the kid okay yeah that's my job it's it's not a it's not a good job but it's my job and what i
[02:11:43.720 --> 02:11:51.960]  have to do it's his job it's his job to protect teachers who abuse students he says is he wants
[02:11:51.960 --> 02:11:58.200]  to bend the truth he said it's what he does all the time so we have the tape he's gonna deny it
[02:11:58.200 --> 02:12:04.200]  but the the njea is in a bunch of hot water today and let me tell you something there is more coming
[02:12:04.200 --> 02:12:10.120]  and it gets worse you know what gets to me james is it's like every one of your videos is like this
[02:12:10.120 --> 02:12:16.280]  they rub their hands together if i saw a netflix show about like you said the goddess it i've seen
[02:12:16.280 --> 02:12:21.560]  very good footage of the goddess they didn't act this craved i mean what is it what is the democratic
[02:12:21.560 --> 02:12:28.120]  party turned into it's like every one of your videos is like next level yeah it's it's it's
[02:12:28.120 --> 02:12:33.160]  you couldn't write a netflix series you couldn't cast the person to play the role but the reason
[02:12:33.160 --> 02:12:36.840]  why that is alexis these people have never been asked a difficult question in their lives is there's
[02:12:36.840 --> 02:12:42.600]  no transparency there's no accountability repert called it the abu grave of the great society
[02:12:42.600 --> 02:12:49.400]  that is to say there's just no uh transparency so you you know you have someone like us come along
[02:12:49.400 --> 02:12:54.680]  we walk in there we spend we spend an hour talking to the guy or sorry half an hour talking to the
[02:12:54.680 --> 02:13:00.680]  guy and it's just one damning quote after they're revealing their soul to us and and i think the
[02:13:00.680 --> 02:13:05.560]  most disgusting thing is that so you hit the kid you hit the kid so what my job is to only defend
[02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:11.560]  the worst of the worst so it's the arrogance it's the lack of introspection it's the it's the lack of
[02:13:11.560 --> 02:13:17.880]  of even self-conscious what he says i'm going to reverse it onto the kid well that's what they do
[02:13:17.880 --> 02:13:23.000]  everything the the the democrats invert everything that's their religion they're not very creative
[02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:30.280]  they just invert invert invert yes and the truth is so powerful here alex is even the local trent
[02:13:30.280 --> 02:13:36.280]  newspaper the jersey papers the new york papers today are saying well even okif is a broken clock
[02:13:36.280 --> 02:13:43.480]  who's right twice a day so they can't come up with a reason to to criticize this now now now um

[02:21:06.040 --> 02:21:12.440]  they're just part of a system that manufacturers consent and and is so monolithic and and we have
[02:21:12.440 --> 02:21:17.080]  to provide a counterbalance by showing people the veritas by showing people the real hidden truth
[02:21:17.080 --> 02:21:22.120]  the great lies and your audience has been so supportive that we've hired more undercover
[02:21:22.120 --> 02:21:27.000]  journalists than ever before we've grown so big that this union store you're seeing this teacher's
[02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:31.640]  union thing you've seen two tapes you're about to see the the one in union city where the woman

[02:21:45.640 --> 02:21:50.520]  want to talk about this tape real quick cathleen valencia i need your audience to do something
[02:21:50.520 --> 02:21:55.480]  for me this this person is the president of the teacher's union and there's a clip in there
[02:21:55.480 --> 02:22:01.480]  where she says and this is the highlight she says this file is from a case where a teacher had sex
[02:22:01.480 --> 02:22:06.840]  the teenage girl and she says we're not he's not going to jail we're protecting his pension
[02:22:06.840 --> 02:22:10.920]  we don't have the name of the teacher what i'd like your audience to do alex is is i want them to
[02:22:10.920 --> 02:22:17.240]  call and email and tweet the nj ea that's the new jersey education association the biggest teachers
[02:22:17.240 --> 02:22:22.760]  union estate and i want you to ask what is the name of that person that's all i want put the
[02:22:22.760 --> 02:22:27.000]  pressure on they've already suspended one president and that's there it is right there if you could
[02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:30.120]  play the clip for the audience that'd be awesome we're going to do that but let me just say this
[02:22:30.120 --> 02:22:34.920]  briefly because i'm going to play even more after you go but we'll play some now i hadn't even seen
[02:22:34.920 --> 02:22:39.400]  this new clip told you got on i saw her in the break it made me physically sick i have three
[02:22:39.400 --> 02:22:46.920]  daughters and just the nonchalant aiding and abetting the crime of rape and child molestation
[02:22:46.920 --> 02:22:53.160]  like it's nonchalant like she's talking about the weather is earth shattering and it's systemic
[02:22:53.160 --> 02:23:00.760]  and it's bizarre and it's crazy and it just shows the mindset of we're going to protect a reported
[02:23:00.760 --> 02:23:07.240]  child rapist pension it's just my god where do they find these people let's play the clip you're
[02:23:07.240 --> 02:23:11.320]  talking about here it is hidden camera union president and mr protecting teacher who had sex
[02:23:11.320 --> 02:23:16.920]  that that's a quote with teenage girl willing to cover up abuse of scumbag here it is right here
[02:23:16.920 --> 02:23:27.320]  is from a teacher okay you're not going to jail you know what this whole pilot is about
[02:23:27.320 --> 02:23:36.200]  it's about whether or not they get to keep their pension okay sex with a teenage girl
[02:23:38.040 --> 02:23:39.400]  oh yeah is he going to jail
[02:23:42.360 --> 02:23:47.800]  i'm being as brutally honest with you as i can if you are afraid of a middle school child
[02:23:48.360 --> 02:23:54.280]  who called you a and spit on you and advanced towards you you are in the wrong profession
[02:23:54.280 --> 02:23:58.600]  keep going keep not hurt i'll just stop right there james is going to leave in a few minutes
[02:23:58.600 --> 02:24:03.000]  for another big interview he's doing but just in closing james i appreciate the fact you think
[02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:06.760]  the show in the audience the only reason i've tried to help you guys is i know how small your
[02:24:06.760 --> 02:24:10.440]  budget is and how important your work is and the fact that you caught google and youtube admitting
[02:24:10.440 --> 02:24:14.920]  that they're trying to censor us number one really showed people that so what you're doing
[02:24:14.920 --> 02:24:19.240]  is invaluable that's why i want to continue try to support the work you're doing but like you said
[02:24:19.240 --> 02:24:23.640]  the real thing is spreading the word getting your videos out so that people understand what
[02:24:23.640 --> 02:24:28.520]  we're facing and the true face of evil we're dealing with i don't know how they're going to be able
[02:24:28.520 --> 02:24:33.080]  to protect this union president in new jersey when she's saying stuff that i would expect
[02:24:33.080 --> 02:24:37.880]  would bring the villagers with the pitchforks you know coming after uh coming up to frankenstein
[02:24:37.880 --> 02:24:42.920]  and his monster i'm not calling for violence here i'm just saying anybody sexually assaults one of
[02:24:42.920 --> 02:24:49.080]  my daughters and i find out people ate it and embedded it i find them just as guilty as the
[02:24:49.080 --> 02:24:55.720]  dirtbag child molester well well well alex they suspended the president last night david perry
[02:24:55.720 --> 02:25:01.480]  now there's this new person what i'd like your audience to do it's very simple is go online go
[02:25:01.480 --> 02:25:08.280]  contact the njea and tweet at them or or facebook at them or email them pick up the phone and call
[02:25:08.280 --> 02:25:13.640]  them and ask what is the name of the teacher who had sex with the girl that they protected
[02:25:13.640 --> 02:25:18.680]  that is a real person it's in a document that she flashed before us we couldn't read the document
[02:25:18.680 --> 02:25:23.080]  she flashed it so so quickly we just want the name of the student let's keep the pressure on
[02:25:23.080 --> 02:25:28.520]  as elinsky would say keep the pressure on the opposition expose the for there they are the njea
[02:25:28.520 --> 02:25:35.480]  tweeted them at njea and there's their phone number and email address there and just ask for
[02:25:35.480 --> 02:25:38.920]  the name of the student we get the name of the teacher not the name of the student name of the
[02:25:38.920 --> 02:25:44.040]  teacher we get that name and we probably have another resignation more pressure more accountability
[02:25:44.040 --> 02:25:47.960]  and exposure for a very important issue i gotta say you have incredible courage they tried to put
[02:25:47.960 --> 02:25:51.960]  you in prison they sued you they've attacked you you know you know somebody by their enemies but
[02:25:51.960 --> 02:25:56.520]  you know the fact that you get that they contact us they contact everybody they say disavow james

[02:30:58.840 --> 02:31:04.120]  got some bad news for the second time in the five and a half year history of survival shield x2 our
[02:31:04.120 --> 02:31:09.800]  flagship product we are having supply chain problems and this may be the last batch of this
[02:31:09.800 --> 02:31:15.480]  we have deep earth crystal source that's so pure that it actually turns into purple gas
[02:31:15.480 --> 02:31:20.920]  in the atmosphere and so in our own search to get the purest form we discovered that oil
[02:31:20.920 --> 02:31:25.400]  companies and gas drilling companies had a by-product that they were selling to pharmaceutical
[02:31:25.400 --> 02:31:30.040]  companies and also drug makers they used to make drugs and once they figure out there's a market
[02:31:30.040 --> 02:31:36.680]  they start jacking up the price but we're offering it still 25 off until it sells out
[02:31:36.680 --> 02:31:40.360]  hopefully just like the last time this happened a few years ago it's not an issue and we do get
[02:31:40.360 --> 02:31:46.840]  more but right now we are not able to secure the crystals that produce the purest iodine in the world
[02:31:46.840 --> 02:31:53.000]  but what it does is for stamina libido focus energy is really amazing survival shield x2
[02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:59.240]  at info wars store.com and fordslife.com they use their media to assassinate real news they use
[02:31:59.240 --> 02:32:04.760]  their schools to teach children that their president is another hitler they use their movie stars and
[02:32:04.760 --> 02:32:09.800]  singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again
[02:32:10.360 --> 02:32:16.280]  and then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance all to make them march make them
[02:32:16.280 --> 02:32:23.160]  protest make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia to smash windows burn
[02:32:23.160 --> 02:32:29.640]  cars shut down interstates and airports bully and terrorize the law-abiding until the only option
[02:32:29.640 --> 02:32:36.200]  left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness and when that happens they'll use it
[02:32:36.200 --> 02:32:43.160]  as an excuse for their outrage the only way we stop this the only way we save our country and
[02:32:43.160 --> 02:32:50.440]  our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth i'm the national
[02:32:50.440 --> 02:33:01.800]  rifle association of america and i'm freedoms safest place you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:33:12.120 --> 02:33:20.280]  discover trends and global developments years before they happen right here on the alex jones
[02:33:20.280 --> 02:33:31.640]  show
[02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:48.840]  ladies and gentlemen we are back live up on info wars dot com and news wars dot com right now
[02:33:48.840 --> 02:33:54.360]  is a very important video from the start of the show today explosions gunfire and black
[02:33:54.360 --> 02:34:03.800]  helicopters terrorize new jersey city and again that is a boil down edit of that that we got posted
[02:34:03.800 --> 02:34:08.920]  up there to the site because remember there's no such thing as black helicopters they're just
[02:34:08.920 --> 02:34:13.400]  constantly doing this and what is the point training the military and the public to accept
[02:34:13.400 --> 02:34:20.760]  troops on the ground do i blame trump for that well he got really big under clinton it went down a
[02:34:20.760 --> 02:34:26.600]  lot under trump it got big again under obama not as big as under clinton and now it's back
[02:34:27.560 --> 02:34:31.720]  and i've talked to the people involved i know all about it i've talked to people at every
[02:34:32.520 --> 02:34:38.680]  level of it the people that fly the helicopters the people that repel down on the rubs the emergency
[02:34:38.680 --> 02:34:45.960]  managers the police chiefs that witness it i made four films on it i'm an expert and it's going on
[02:34:48.360 --> 02:34:52.040]  now why is it so important because the mainstream media would tell you you're crazy it's always on
[02:34:52.040 --> 02:34:58.120]  local news but then if you talk about it nationally or debate why it's happening oh you're bad so i
[02:34:58.120 --> 02:35:02.600]  never played the audio of this i mean we do in the special report but department defense training
[02:35:02.600 --> 02:35:09.960]  exercise terrifies unprepared tatawa new jersey residents so we just keep staying focused on new
[02:35:09.960 --> 02:35:15.880]  jersey we just had the two different union heads saying they cover up crimes and sex crimes against
[02:35:15.880 --> 02:35:20.840]  children one lady says it's just insane so i guess we're obsessed with new jersey back to new jersey
[02:35:20.840 --> 02:35:25.880]  let's go ahead and go to the cbs news report and analyze it here it is captures the moment a helicopter
[02:35:25.880 --> 02:35:31.400]  flies above a total of a new jersey neighborhood oh that is sick there's excitement in the photographer's
[02:35:31.400 --> 02:35:36.120]  voice but that's because this was taken on the second night of action i've never seen anything
[02:35:36.120 --> 02:35:40.920]  like this before michael melagrano took that video from his backyard on rutherford court the
[02:35:40.920 --> 02:35:45.640]  helicopter is flying right above the north jersey developmental center which is under construction
[02:35:45.640 --> 02:35:50.840]  there was a black walk helicopter flying right over here he can now laugh and even brag about
[02:35:50.840 --> 02:35:55.880]  what happened but in the heat of the moment he says his entire block was petrified i was really
[02:35:55.880 --> 02:36:00.600]  scared i had no idea what was going on around 10 o'clock at night on april 16th this community
[02:36:00.600 --> 02:36:06.040]  was rocked by piercing explosions please get about that you know that's happening the night times
[02:36:06.040 --> 02:36:13.240]  first it was explosions and then the the chopper was so low that our house was vibrating most of the
[02:36:13.240 --> 02:36:18.600]  block came running outside in panic john amola says his daughter called 911 to find out what was
[02:36:18.600 --> 02:36:23.000]  happening but got a short answer and they said well you gotta talk to the state police about it
[02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:27.880]  eventually they learned members of the united states armed forces were training in secret for three
[02:36:27.880 --> 02:36:33.240]  nights so we went to both local and state police to find out why these residents weren't given a heads
[02:36:33.240 --> 02:36:39.960]  up neighbors say they should have been informed and next time they're hoping they get a heads up
[02:36:42.040 --> 02:36:47.560]  notice no response from the state police and the old days they'd say you're insane it didn't happen
[02:36:48.520 --> 02:36:51.320]  they'd write front page news articles saying i was insane the paper
[02:36:51.320 --> 02:37:00.600]  it's like there's stands of those online maybe click uh alex jones black helicopters texas
[02:37:02.120 --> 02:37:11.560]  alex jones um i think army texas raids and you can click images on bing because google
[02:37:11.560 --> 02:37:16.200]  so bad or use one of the other sub pages and you can also search web world net daily
[02:37:16.200 --> 02:37:19.560]  did stories on it and then you can actually see a lot better video than what they got
[02:37:19.560 --> 02:37:26.760]  not off his cell phone but notice they were doing it at a former government facility that
[02:37:26.760 --> 02:37:30.760]  was under construction that means they gutted it they were going to do damage to it then they're
[02:37:30.760 --> 02:37:36.600]  going to either tear it down or rebuild it like i told you they always do it at some unnamed site
[02:37:36.600 --> 02:37:43.960]  in the middle of the neighborhood as a scyop test and it's always formulaic over and over and over
[02:37:43.960 --> 02:37:48.520]  and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again so again if you're a radio
[02:37:48.520 --> 02:37:55.800]  listener you can see this but just another thing we told you about 23 years ago that nowadays
[02:37:58.200 --> 02:38:06.760]  they admit is going on and it's the same thing cell phone radiation it's getting stronger
[02:38:06.760 --> 02:38:11.000]  they're putting more of them up brain tumors alone directly connected to it doubling
[02:38:12.200 --> 02:38:18.280]  brain tumors aren't fun folks dying ain't cool but everybody in this domesticated western world
[02:38:18.280 --> 02:38:26.680]  doesn't believe something bad till it hits them and people even laugh at me on the street they go oh
[02:38:26.680 --> 02:38:34.520]  it's the gay frog guy or oh the cell phones are gonna get me oh my children i let them have cell
[02:38:34.520 --> 02:38:37.160]  phones that they're going out with friends or something for security saying i say don't put it
[02:38:37.160 --> 02:38:43.240]  up your head you know blah blah blah and then they go oh dad it's not bad for us i just totally
[02:38:43.240 --> 02:38:51.640]  took them away because they are great tools you know keep track of your children now you know
[02:38:51.640 --> 02:38:57.640]  rex wanted to report on it cell phones more dangerous than cigarette smoking and we're just here
[02:38:58.680 --> 02:39:03.480]  trying to warn folks and guess what videos facebook twitter and google particularly
[02:39:03.480 --> 02:39:08.840]  block and shadow ban where they don't virally spread but you have to hand share them bingo
[02:39:08.840 --> 02:39:13.720]  so anything about atrazine or chemicals in the water affecting your sexuality
[02:39:13.720 --> 02:39:20.840]  banned anything warning you about cell phone brain tumors because there's a big fat juicy
[02:39:20.840 --> 02:39:26.600]  corporate agenda but the elites are going to these spas the middle know where they fly out
[02:39:26.600 --> 02:39:33.080]  there by jet or helicopter no wi-fi allowed no cell phones allowed those cell phones allowed
[02:39:33.080 --> 02:39:39.240]  bohemian growth no wi-fi nothing's allowed the rich people go to these resorts
[02:39:41.080 --> 02:39:45.400]  they have landline telephones only one television in the whole lodge
[02:39:47.800 --> 02:39:52.840]  now they're singing in florida exposure in utero link to lower IQs yeah there's an old david

[02:39:57.960 --> 02:40:04.120]  and man that was such a big deal for me at the time because grudge reporting stuff linked to it
[02:40:05.320 --> 02:40:09.320]  and people didn't believe yet yeah read the whole series it's got photos and videos i shot
[02:40:10.440 --> 02:40:17.720]  operation last dance in texas but imagine the paper would say i had made it up
[02:40:19.720 --> 02:40:23.480]  and imagine that when you're sitting with an aust american statesman state police
[02:40:23.480 --> 02:40:28.920]  chief dip guys former state police lieutenant and they're writing articles basically saying it doesn't

[02:40:42.600 --> 02:40:48.040]  i was aware of a proposed tabletop exercise that means not real life which was to occur in austin
[02:40:48.040 --> 02:40:54.120]  like last year the word was the feds were to play five hundred thousand dollars the city of austin
[02:40:54.120 --> 02:40:59.800]  for their cooperation vreeland told world nut daily he said the publicity caused by local talk

[02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:13.320]  didn't believe me about it till later they talked to the delta force guys and he said no it's bill
[02:41:13.320 --> 02:41:27.000]  clinton he's training us for pdd gun confiscation but imagine that was like a 1996 97 it was so
[02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:36.520]  revolutionary because that because i mean they had me on cbs nbc they had late night comics

[02:42:23.320 --> 02:42:32.680]  waves that then bounce back on a sensor and it gives it an image this is not of this world
[02:42:32.680 --> 02:42:36.520]  folks this is like an alien invasion i'm not saying that's what it is but this is like a

[03:00:06.680 --> 03:00:10.040]  here he is alex jones
[03:00:14.200 --> 03:00:18.040]  i'm gonna hand the ton to the former prosecutor city kid of tv and radio host linald
[03:00:18.760 --> 03:00:22.360]  the linel media right now but i just wanted to bring this up i haven't really gotten into muller
[03:00:23.800 --> 03:00:30.440]  and the raid it's too much because we know where this is going it's totally criminal it's totally
[03:00:30.440 --> 03:00:35.560]  lawless it's a giant ragnad yeah muller up to his eyeballs and uranium one hillary i mean it's a
[03:00:35.560 --> 03:00:41.720]  joke it's it's foxes watching the henhouse and the cowards all around trump and sessions and all of it
[03:00:42.840 --> 03:00:46.360]  it's a nightmare situation and they're going to try a fake indictment of the president which
[03:00:46.360 --> 03:00:50.600]  will just embarrass him there's three branches of government they think the public's dumb
[03:00:50.600 --> 03:00:52.360]  so they're going to say why isn't he stepping down
[03:00:55.640 --> 03:01:00.360]  but i haven't covered it much because it's really the president to get hardcore
[03:01:00.360 --> 03:01:07.640]  or not just call muller a criminal and call me a criminal but to fire sessions and put somebody
[03:01:07.640 --> 03:01:12.360]  in there it's the executive branch by the way they'll start the indictments because we've got them open
[03:01:12.360 --> 03:01:20.360]  and shut but again we've got this stagnant cowardly country at the top just like the project veritas
[03:01:20.360 --> 03:01:25.080]  videos you just saw with people saying we cover up teachers assaulting kids we cover them up having
[03:01:25.080 --> 03:01:33.240]  sex with little girls that's what runs this country now from the bottom to the top republicans can
[03:01:33.240 --> 03:01:37.160]  be corrupt too but they're nothing like democrats democrats are a special breed
[03:01:38.360 --> 03:01:42.920]  final i got one more little clip i want to play of the of the to hear a lawyer and a prosecutor
[03:01:43.800 --> 03:01:48.520]  i looked at hippa rules i have employees i've been through divorces you know divorce i know about
[03:01:48.520 --> 03:01:53.480]  hippa and i know that you can go to any doctor you want to man your medical records the hard copies
[03:01:53.480 --> 03:01:58.760]  so i want to hit this after the break his doctor says he feels raped because trump took his medical
[03:01:58.760 --> 03:02:03.160]  records and he's sitting there changing his story now that trump wrote the letter which he says he
[03:02:03.160 --> 03:02:07.320]  wrote so he has no credibility but i want to ask you that the next segment is briefly muller
[03:02:08.680 --> 03:02:12.840]  you're a former prosecutor she can speak better to this but just watching this train wreck
[03:02:12.840 --> 03:02:16.280]  and this rogue element of government i know the branches of government and to watch the
[03:02:16.280 --> 03:02:21.000]  media act like muller is his own fourth branch am i wrong in what i said or am i right or what
[03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:28.280]  do you want to add to that absolutely i was just thinking did somebody did somebody connect my
[03:02:28.280 --> 03:02:34.120]  brain this is what i was saying today look i got a news for the for the world look i love
[03:02:34.120 --> 03:02:39.880]  shon hanity and rudy juliani is a great guy and a great friend and a great person but this
[03:02:40.600 --> 03:02:45.960]  is not a substitute for prosecution this is terrific and every day when you hear about
[03:02:45.960 --> 03:02:52.040]  somebody saying tick tock and hillary does this and hillary does this well damn it do something
[03:02:52.040 --> 03:02:56.760]  and the president is the not only the commander-in-chief but he is the head of the executive he can
[03:02:56.760 --> 03:03:04.120]  walk in and say whoever has a job he can walk into the doj it says whoever has a job take one step
[03:03:04.120 --> 03:03:14.200]  forward not so fast sessions you're out rosa steen out all of you out gone through i want to find out
[03:03:14.200 --> 03:03:21.560]  are you going to charge hillary clinton with something at either a yes or a no because alex
[03:03:21.560 --> 03:03:27.320]  she's the canary in the judicial coal mine if she's not charged look how many times a week
[03:03:27.320 --> 03:03:35.080]  do you hear of some poor mistaken person thrown away for 30 years on some trumped up rape charge
[03:03:35.080 --> 03:03:43.800]  we jump on people for the most the most monumentally insignificant crimes we throw people away we
[03:03:43.800 --> 03:03:50.520]  don't care about jurisprudence but we're so afraid to charge hillary with something because
[03:03:50.520 --> 03:03:57.320]  that's because she knows where the bodies are buried precisely precisely and here's the thing too
[03:03:57.880 --> 03:04:05.720]  this may be terrific but rudy juliani again whom i respect on so many levels did he understand
[03:04:05.720 --> 03:04:11.640]  the script last night what is he did he understand he threw trump under the bus by saying oh yeah we
[03:04:11.640 --> 03:04:16.120]  knew all about the payout yeah he did it say wait a minute hold it what do you do you talk to each
[03:04:16.120 --> 03:04:22.920]  other you're you're i mean i i can't say it enough i love the man but even they don't know how to do
[03:04:22.920 --> 03:04:27.800]  it why are we going through so many in-house councils and if you think flood is it going to
[03:04:27.800 --> 03:04:32.120]  be subject to some kind of motion to recuse or conflict of interest you don't think the clitons
[03:04:32.120 --> 03:04:36.440]  are going to be safe wait a minute you're helping him well walk us walk us through this walk us
[03:04:36.440 --> 03:04:41.640]  through this and we'll play the juliani clips and then the doctor saying he was raped because trump
[03:04:41.640 --> 03:04:47.320]  got his medical records when the doctor released that he was on from pisha that violated hipa and

[03:06:29.960 --> 03:06:35.960]  and twitter is going to be hosting the shower and soon we're hiring more board ops and more
[03:06:35.960 --> 03:06:39.560]  producers i want to talk to lionel and a bunch of people we just keep waiting and waiting
[03:06:39.560 --> 03:06:43.080]  because it's the process of hiring and training and finishing their studios we're very close
[03:06:43.080 --> 03:06:49.960]  trying to launch new programs new syndications and i'm very excited we've gotten over 300 tv
[03:06:49.960 --> 03:06:56.680]  stations and cable networks it's over 300 stations it's sort of like 60 70 cable networks
[03:06:56.680 --> 03:07:01.560]  and that sounds big but there's thousands across the country and it is big some of them are main
[03:07:01.560 --> 03:07:05.880]  stations other ones are sub you know digital stations they have extra stations now whole feeds
[03:07:05.880 --> 03:07:11.080]  you know channel nine in houston phonoscope 24 hours a day i mean we've been on there a couple
[03:07:11.080 --> 03:07:17.560]  years but now we're 24 hours a day uh we've gotten over 100 tv stations the last two weeks so
[03:07:18.760 --> 03:07:22.040]  we've got a lot of new radio affiliates we never get above about 260 or so
[03:07:23.160 --> 03:07:27.400]  and a lot of them are giant some of them are 50 000 watt am's they're wonderful but the tv's
[03:07:27.400 --> 03:07:31.560]  going better than i thought so that's very very exciting so i'm gonna try to work with a lot of
[03:07:31.560 --> 03:07:35.320]  folks to launch some new broadcasts hopefully with lionel in their future but i wanted to just
[03:07:35.320 --> 03:07:40.840]  selfishly because i know he's a really smart prosecutor and author and so much more get into
[03:07:40.840 --> 03:07:45.400]  this but when you read the news for 23 years and you study this you go through things you you start
[03:07:45.400 --> 03:07:51.400]  to learn how the branch of the government law work and you see clinton day one he gets in he fires
[03:07:51.400 --> 03:07:57.080]  90 something federal prosecutors and us attorneys us attorneys and then anytime attorney general
[03:07:57.080 --> 03:07:59.800]  doesn't do what he wants boom you're fired it's just like oh the media's like of course that's
[03:07:59.800 --> 03:08:05.640]  just you're right to do it trump they build it up where you can't fire anybody and rosa's thing
[03:08:05.640 --> 03:08:09.320]  you do whatever he wants and then it turns out rosa's team's involved in the cover-up and
[03:08:10.600 --> 03:08:15.400]  uranium one and protects the clinton's and they're involved in the fake dossier and then
[03:08:15.400 --> 03:08:19.480]  shannon's getting awards at the press dinner for the dossier reporting it's like a it's like a
[03:08:19.480 --> 03:08:27.000]  a money pythons kid it's just ridiculous and so all the corruptions there you know all the
[03:08:27.000 --> 03:08:33.000]  things hillary down the servers and uranium one and hadie scams and 84 million laundered money
[03:08:33.000 --> 03:08:40.200]  all confirmed in the foundation out of billions and then it's all stormy daniels uh a woman got
[03:08:40.200 --> 03:08:45.400]  130 thousand dollars and and then gillian he's like well it wasn't from campaign money so that
[03:08:45.400 --> 03:08:51.560]  doesn't matter like he's trying to dynamite the oilfield fire with another explosion and then all
[03:08:51.560 --> 03:08:59.960]  that does is explode even crazier and meanwhile we're trying to take us to war again we've got
[03:08:59.960 --> 03:09:05.160]  all this crazy stuff happening and i know trump's approval rating even though they try to skew it
[03:09:05.160 --> 03:09:10.680]  downward with oversampling democrats it's doubled in in its support of from from black males it's
[03:09:10.680 --> 03:09:15.880]  up in black females in a lot of polls he's 55 percent even though they're oversampling 15
[03:09:15.880 --> 03:09:21.720]  points democrats so trump's super popular the economy's coming back he's very pragmatic president
[03:09:21.720 --> 03:09:26.760]  i wouldn't call him a republican but just an americana guy and the left just gets more insane
[03:09:26.760 --> 03:09:33.160]  more crazy they talk with like worshipful i just get a little sicked out by men talking about
[03:09:33.160 --> 03:09:37.320]  quarterbacks worshipfully and getting little twinkles in their eyes it wasn't even that was
[03:09:37.320 --> 03:09:41.880]  gay it was just worshipful it's kind of sick you know i like football this is beyond that i've never
[03:09:41.880 --> 03:09:47.960]  seen media sick authentic like mueller's coming mueller's gonna get you oh mueller that the since
[03:09:47.960 --> 03:09:55.080]  when are the leftists worship raw state rogue power runaway special counsel and so at this point
[03:09:55.080 --> 03:10:00.840]  trump not firing sessions which is the real problem there and and and rosenstein for me
[03:10:00.840 --> 03:10:05.480]  it's trump dereliction of duty he wants to act tough and he's made some big moves on great on
[03:10:05.480 --> 03:10:09.800]  north korean things i want to believe that but when there's dereliction of duty that it's his
[03:10:09.800 --> 03:10:14.440]  office he's in charge these people are completely rogue i got to start blaming president trump
[03:10:14.440 --> 03:10:19.080]  instead of just blaming the attorney general what do you say as an expert on this let me say something
[03:10:19.080 --> 03:10:22.440]  the thing you just right it said right now alex nobody's ever gonna remember because they're
[03:10:22.440 --> 03:10:27.560]  gonna call you some sycophantic lick spittle some bootlicker some toadies some fawning
[03:10:27.560 --> 03:10:33.000]  you know trump acolyte and what you just said is what i've said look this man works for me
[03:10:33.000 --> 03:10:40.120]  he's my president i'm not his slave his serve his acolyte doesn't work like that his foreign
[03:10:40.120 --> 03:10:44.360]  policy is schizophrenic i don't even know what he's talking about the whole thing about syria
[03:10:44.360 --> 03:10:49.320]  the whole script ball poisoning he's talking about he's going up to a to a superpower a nuclear
[03:10:49.320 --> 03:10:53.880]  superpower sticking his thumb in his eye and then expecting me to sit back and applaud him
[03:10:53.880 --> 03:10:59.000]  i don't understand that and by the way stormy daniels is here for one reason as we see more
[03:10:59.000 --> 03:11:05.960]  more information about north korea which alex if i ever told you if i went into this um before the
[03:11:05.960 --> 03:11:12.840]  president was elected and i said one day he's going to bring peace to north korea you'd look at me
[03:11:12.840 --> 03:11:18.120]  like i was high or something and he did it no mention of the nobel prize no mention about anything
[03:11:18.120 --> 03:11:23.720]  that's going on prisoner exchange no stormy daniels so what he's doing right now is the only
[03:11:23.720 --> 03:11:29.160]  firing that's going on is his only go council what's that all about i don't understand this it
[03:11:29.160 --> 03:11:33.240]  gives the impression that he doesn't know what he's doing by the way we spent so much time on this
[03:11:33.240 --> 03:11:39.000]  michelle wolf story for god's sake i mean that was interesting kind of but it seems like the
[03:11:39.000 --> 03:11:45.160]  mainstream media the the corporate sock puppet ted baxter the echo chamber cookie cutter you know
[03:11:45.160 --> 03:11:50.120]  bumper sticker media they love low hanging fruit they love things that are easy to decide and look
[03:11:50.120 --> 03:11:55.160]  at this this avanade this this photo bombing photo bombing on him he's just a little creep
[03:11:56.040 --> 03:12:02.040]  look look at what and cnn basically you've had him on what 59 times you know there was a time alex
[03:12:02.040 --> 03:12:06.280]  in the old days when cnn was it the only time you go to cnn is when there's a plane crash
[03:12:06.280 --> 03:12:11.560]  we're done we're done lemon will ask you whether there's a possibility that the malaysian plane
[03:12:11.560 --> 03:12:17.080]  was sucked up into a black hole in our own atmosphere well let's go back to this the president
[03:12:17.080 --> 03:12:23.320]  owns all of this the department of justice is he is and for some reason we have reconstructed
[03:12:23.320 --> 03:12:28.200]  this notion of the superstructure and the hierarchy and we made it sound like oh no no
[03:12:28.200 --> 03:12:35.240]  if he fires uh who sessions or muller or whoever it's it's it's grounds for impeachment impeachment
[03:12:35.240 --> 03:12:43.960]  is just a charge if you get 51 senators or or percent rather in the house you can impeach him
[03:12:43.960 --> 03:12:50.520]  for being gluten intolerant it doesn't matter and and and let's be clear the democrats announced
[03:12:50.520 --> 03:12:54.760]  yesterday got almost no attention was in the hill they're going to run on impeachment that's their
[03:12:54.760 --> 03:12:59.560]  policy and if trump was failing on the economy and stuff it might work this is so obstructionist
[03:12:59.560 --> 03:13:06.040]  so insane so out of control and then shifting gears we've got his lawyer and and and and let's
[03:13:06.040 --> 03:13:13.960]  cue that up uh well first let's go to uh juliani who's also his lawyer and if we're looking at this
[03:13:14.520 --> 03:13:18.840]  they're saying that you know juliani was going to come in and fix things in two weeks well now
[03:13:18.840 --> 03:13:24.360]  we're three weeks later and it looks to me like i don't know what juliani's doing it's like you said
[03:13:24.360 --> 03:13:28.120]  we don't know what's going on i know he's firing a bunch of his lawyers because they told him it'd
[03:13:28.120 --> 03:13:32.200]  be over by christmas and it'd be over by april and that muller wasn't going to go for obstruction
[03:13:32.200 --> 03:13:37.160]  and that muller wasn't that bad well now trump knows that he was advised right by roger stone
[03:13:37.160 --> 03:13:40.840]  and myself and others that the whole time they are coming after him can you can you speak to that
[03:13:41.960 --> 03:13:47.720]  well the thing is that rudy was supposed to come in rudy was sold as follows that rudy knows how
[03:13:47.720 --> 03:13:53.560]  things work that rudy is respected in the in the in the department of justice that he can make
[03:13:53.560 --> 03:13:59.080]  um connections and he has avenues and he has a way in uh that other people just don't have that's
[03:13:59.080 --> 03:14:04.200]  the way it was sold but just by virtue of the appearance last night was sean hanity first of
[03:14:04.200 --> 03:14:10.360]  all referring to comey as some kind of a pervert that doesn't help anything it also gave the people
[03:14:10.360 --> 03:14:18.120]  the impression that it was it was scattershot it was slipshot it was uh you know a uh a a cluster
[03:14:18.760 --> 03:14:26.360]  attack of nothing i can't say this enough what people need to understand is how profoundly
[03:14:26.360 --> 03:14:34.360]  unconstitutional everything is i mean everything it's not merely it's not how do i say this it's
[03:14:34.360 --> 03:14:41.000]  not just unfair but what muller has been doing going back to dossier going back to do you realize
[03:14:41.000 --> 03:14:46.360]  let me just uh give you this so far we only have in terms of in diamonds alex we have what for
[03:14:46.360 --> 03:14:51.800]  technically manaforton gates who by the way predated trump that was ukraine that was before
[03:14:51.800 --> 03:14:56.840]  and they're all process issues right it was about banking and it was about reporting and
[03:14:56.840 --> 03:15:02.840]  that sort of thing then we have flinn and palpatopoulos flinn by the way is most probably
[03:15:02.840 --> 03:15:09.400]  going to have his plea withdrawn and let me tell you something in the world of juridical uh um
[03:15:09.400 --> 03:15:15.320]  handicapping having a plea withdrawn you never do it it never happened there's a certainty to it
[03:15:15.320 --> 03:15:20.680]  but the judge even signaled i know what you're doing so that's flinn and the other indictments
[03:15:20.680 --> 03:15:27.080]  are these 13 bots remember these these russians that nobody heard of nobody knew and it came on
[03:15:27.080 --> 03:15:31.800]  the friday after the fbi was told why didn't you follow up when we warned you about that shooter
[03:15:31.800 --> 03:15:37.000]  in florida that's all they've got so far exactly and they're cornered rats that know they've
[03:15:37.000 --> 03:15:40.680]  committed all these crimes so they're they're just committed to keep going i want to hear your
[03:15:40.680 --> 03:15:45.400]  prediction of how this all ends currently we'll play those uleani clips and then the doctor
[03:15:45.400 --> 03:15:49.960]  thinking got right by trump i mean this is the most insane so now he's part of the me too movement
[03:15:49.960 --> 03:15:57.800]  because trump got his medical records you have been lied to my name is kevin ship i'm a former
[03:15:57.800 --> 03:16:03.480]  decorated cia officer finally someone has come out and written what i think is the best x mose
[03:16:03.480 --> 03:16:08.040]  on the shadow government ever we're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now
[03:16:08.040 --> 03:16:12.680]  being run ruled by a shadow government we got to get this out because just because you're awake

[03:18:12.440 --> 03:18:17.720]  was filed in federal court tuesday and seeks to put an end to the unconstitutional immigration
[03:18:17.720 --> 03:18:23.320]  program which protects many illegals from deportation paxton said the multi-state coalition
[03:18:23.320 --> 03:18:29.480]  lawsuit is about the rule of law not the wisdom of any particular immigration policy the suit

[03:19:59.240 --> 03:20:24.680]  and you said the money was not campaign money i'm giving you a fact now that you don't know
[03:20:24.680 --> 03:20:29.640]  it's not campaign money no campaign violation and i said because they funneled through a law firm
[03:20:29.640 --> 03:20:33.240]  i think we're we were talking about two different things there i want to make sure i was talking
[03:20:33.240 --> 03:20:37.560]  about the 130 thousand dollar payment right the settlement payment which is a very regular thing
[03:20:37.560 --> 03:20:44.040]  for lawyers to do the question there was the only possible violation there would be was it a campaign
[03:20:44.040 --> 03:20:49.160]  finance violation which usually were results in a fine by the way not this big storm storm
[03:20:49.160 --> 03:20:55.080]  troop was coming in and breaking down his apartment and breaking out his office that was money that was
[03:20:55.080 --> 03:21:01.960]  paid by um by his lawyer the way i would do out of his law firm funds or whatever funds
[03:21:01.960 --> 03:21:05.720]  doesn't matter the president reimbursed that over a period of several months he had said
[03:21:05.720 --> 03:21:12.360]  didn't i remember i distinctly remember that he did it on his own he did without asking i don't
[03:21:12.360 --> 03:21:17.560]  know i haven't investigated that no reason to dispute that no reason to dispute his recollection
[03:21:17.560 --> 03:21:23.800]  i like michael a lot listen here's the deal folks we didn't elect this guy that's a saint when it
[03:21:23.800 --> 03:21:30.120]  comes to women we all know he likes to run beauty pageants okay so we didn't elect him for that we
[03:21:30.120 --> 03:21:34.760]  didn't think we were elected in the first bat this minister here the woman didn't even alleged abuse
[03:21:34.760 --> 03:21:41.320]  11 years ago she has shown herself to be a horrible political tool following the president around
[03:21:41.320 --> 03:21:47.160]  basically stalking him in my view politically and dancing in whatever town the president said
[03:21:47.160 --> 03:21:53.000]  outside marlogan which is her right to do she has her lawyer photobombing everybody but
[03:21:54.360 --> 03:22:00.360]  pulling back from this you've got linel here is a former prosecutor syndicated talk show
[03:22:00.360 --> 03:22:06.920]  some really very articulate smart guy on this front what is the point of him going out then
[03:22:06.920 --> 03:22:12.520]  and even saying that a and then b what about the issue of this judge that married george soros and
[03:22:12.520 --> 03:22:18.120]  his third wife a couple years ago this big clinton operative hillary's quote favorite judge she has
[03:22:18.120 --> 03:22:21.960]  all the files which are as you know under federal law only supposed to have in the fbi
[03:22:21.960 --> 03:22:26.840]  until it's given it gives the prosecutor or whatever for trial by the unit that's involved
[03:22:26.840 --> 03:22:31.400]  with the information who's tasked with it she has it digitized put on a federal database
[03:22:31.400 --> 03:22:37.640]  and within 48 hours all this other stuff is all none of it's really criminal is all over the media
[03:22:37.640 --> 03:22:44.520]  and the entire political fbi is in trump's private lawyer stuff this is next level criminal activity
[03:22:44.520 --> 03:22:49.720]  in my view okay you just ask about 20 different things and they were all good let me start with
[03:22:49.720 --> 03:22:55.320]  this one right now let me give you a fact pattern let's assume that at some particular point
[03:22:55.960 --> 03:23:01.800]  donald trump spoke to a an fbi agent somebody in the federal government and there's just wonderful
[03:23:01.800 --> 03:23:08.600]  statue called 18 usc 1001 and it basically says you lie to the federal government that's it not
[03:23:08.600 --> 03:23:13.640]  under oath necessarily not in a grand jury but the way they got martha steward martha steward was
[03:23:13.640 --> 03:23:19.640]  never put away for you know insider trading it was because she lied now let's assume after we
[03:23:19.640 --> 03:23:24.200]  remember what what happened just now trump told somebody an fbi agent we don't know who he's talked
[03:23:24.200 --> 03:23:30.840]  to he said no no i knew nothing about this michael cohen on his own i'll think about this on his own
[03:23:30.840 --> 03:23:36.200]  without even telling me whoever does this imagine me being your lawyer and i say don't tell alex
[03:23:36.200 --> 03:23:41.880]  but i'm gonna pay this and by the way i'm gonna get a a second mortgage on my house i'm gonna
[03:23:41.880 --> 03:23:50.120]  refinance my house to pay for this amount i'm a millionaire but i need to refinance my house
[03:23:50.120 --> 03:23:57.480]  to pay for this that you don't know about i did this without you knowing it now trump
[03:23:57.480 --> 03:24:02.920]  let's assume later on says hey look i knew nothing about this i and let's assume for yeah you could
[03:24:02.920 --> 03:24:08.680]  argue it was cohen and i'm not saying cohen did this setting trump up doing that getting in his
[03:24:08.680 --> 03:24:13.160]  business to pay somebody off and we all know that's not what happened we all know at a gut level he's
[03:24:13.160 --> 03:24:18.200]  the president's lawyer lawyers take care of stuff you trust your lawyer later they go hey i did this
[03:24:18.200 --> 03:24:22.120]  boom that's how it works it's not illegal you're taking care of something they're trying but you're
[03:24:22.120 --> 03:24:27.720]  saying process if cohen's lying about anything that's how they're getting well what about this what
[03:24:27.720 --> 03:24:34.200]  if trump lies what if they use juliani's statement right now on the shan hanity show use that as a
[03:24:34.200 --> 03:24:39.160]  basis to charge trump with perjury or the violation of the statute because the reason why you take the
[03:24:39.160 --> 03:24:44.200]  fifth amendment alex you can go into a grand jury or or a setting and you can be given you know
[03:24:44.200 --> 03:24:49.000]  under oath or whatever it is you can speak the truth but if somebody else contradicts what you're
[03:24:49.000 --> 03:24:53.560]  saying that could be the charge of perjury so because they don't even have the story straight
[03:24:53.560 --> 03:24:56.840]  not gonna he should plead the fidget because it's self-incrimination but here's the problem
[03:24:57.800 --> 03:25:02.520]  the president is the head of the executive as you know or you'd always have some other grand jury
[03:25:02.520 --> 03:25:07.320]  or some group rogue trying to take them down that's why only an indictment in the house conviction
[03:25:07.320 --> 03:25:12.680]  the senate can remove the president so it's all just exactly the president needs to act like the
[03:25:12.680 --> 03:25:18.920]  president and his lawyers we know gave him bad advice but if trump said to somebody let's say in
[03:25:18.920 --> 03:25:22.840]  the course of something an official authority an official with the federal government if he said
[03:25:22.840 --> 03:25:27.720]  i knew nothing about this payment from calling and rudy just said oh no he knew about it he paid
[03:25:27.720 --> 03:25:33.720]  him he in fact even paid repaid this now you're having basically rudy could be the witness against
[03:25:33.720 --> 03:25:38.120]  trump for perjury yeah it's you know they may know what they're doing it's just such a distraction
[03:25:38.120 --> 03:25:43.960]  with all the news we've got what about this juliani says kushner disposable the whole country will
[03:25:43.960 --> 03:25:49.480]  turn if they go after avonka so what is he saying there like go ahead and get him we're not going
[03:25:49.480 --> 03:25:55.240]  to roll over for kushner and then he's saying but don't go after avonka i mean this is this is crazy
[03:25:55.240 --> 03:26:01.400]  let's play that club now i think if they do do avonka which i doubt they will the whole country
[03:26:01.400 --> 03:26:06.520]  will turn on them they're going after his daughter what about his son-in-law that talked about him
[03:26:06.520 --> 03:26:14.840]  i guess i jarred is a fine man you know that but men are you know disposable but a fine woman like
[03:26:14.840 --> 03:26:22.600]  avonka come on and what does that mean what what does that even mean what is that listen like i said
[03:26:22.600 --> 03:26:27.240]  you know alex i think they're signaling the Mueller you go ahead and go after kushner we're
[03:26:27.240 --> 03:26:31.640]  going to throw him out of the bus they're not signaling anything if they were going to signal
[03:26:31.640 --> 03:26:36.360]  they would have done this in a better way not on national television and not because you can hear
[03:26:36.360 --> 03:26:42.440]  shan trying to rehabilitate rudy during the first question he said uh are you sure you know
[03:26:42.440 --> 03:26:49.080]  my understanding of this is such and such look this is this is an example this is the legal
[03:26:49.080 --> 03:26:53.560]  yeah it's really on the over the hill because he's kind of acting a little crazy well i don't want
[03:26:53.560 --> 03:26:56.840]  to look i don't want to do to him what they're doing to cotton you west whenever you do something
[03:26:56.840 --> 03:27:02.200]  or whatever you're misspoken i don't know if if he was feeling a little too comfortable with us
[03:27:02.200 --> 03:27:08.920]  i have no idea all i know is this today uh you have to understand and you have to master
[03:27:08.920 --> 03:27:16.440]  electronic advocacy not only courtroom going on tv can actually change the way charges are brought
[03:27:16.440 --> 03:27:20.360]  it could change the momentum no you're absolutely right so so so let's move to this next subject
[03:27:20.360 --> 03:27:26.760]  i'm gonna let you take over get a lot to cover this is the the doctor of the president who says
[03:27:26.760 --> 03:27:32.200]  that he's in great health and all this and that in the no i didn't uh you know uh get told what to
[03:27:32.200 --> 03:27:36.520]  write this is the truth i wrote it he's all testified to that he said that a year and a half ago
[03:27:36.520 --> 03:27:41.720]  now he says no i dictated it over the phone and i feel like trump raped me because they came and
[03:27:41.720 --> 03:27:45.880]  got my medical records well i know under law i can go get my medical records from the doctor
[03:27:46.600 --> 03:27:50.280]  anything that's digitized like you know prescriptions whatever's online but then
[03:27:51.080 --> 03:27:55.160]  that's law but if the doctor says i'm on propitia publicly and i didn't authorize that with the
[03:27:55.160 --> 03:28:00.200]  hippo release that's a federal crime so it looks like the doctor to me is committing a federal crime
[03:28:00.200 --> 03:28:03.880]  we're going to come back and play the clip i'm going to get your take on this and then get out
[03:28:03.880 --> 03:28:08.360]  of here for you to take over because you know you're a lawyer from a prosecutor maybe i'm wrong
[03:28:08.360 --> 03:28:12.280]  about him but i've looked it up suddenly suddenly put pressure on everybody that supports trump
[03:28:12.280 --> 03:28:17.160]  they've done to me so suddenly this guy says he hates trump and when i said he was on propitia
[03:28:17.160 --> 03:28:21.800]  they came and took the medical files and i feel raped and he's sitting there like he's this poor
[03:28:21.800 --> 03:28:29.080]  victim why would you do this you also have a duty as a kind of almost a physician patient duty
[03:28:29.080 --> 03:28:36.360]  and privilege though not to not reveal and embarrass patients i don't get it we'll stay there
[03:28:36.360 --> 03:28:41.640]  absolutely right actually under the hypocriticals and the law doctors aren't supposed to reveal anything
[03:28:41.640 --> 03:28:45.800]  personal so he's out here blabbering the president's personal stuff the day after he does it they
[03:28:45.800 --> 03:28:51.640]  show him he'll give us the medical records jackass and he goes i feel raped and seeing it headline doctor
[03:28:51.640 --> 03:28:57.560]  raped healthcare reform is confusing but whether it's finding an affordable insurance plan keeping
[03:28:57.560 --> 03:29:01.880]  your doctor or being able to afford needed prescriptions navigating the healthcare system

[03:30:04.120 --> 03:30:10.120]  having supply chain problems and this may be the last batch of this we have deep earth crystal
[03:30:10.120 --> 03:30:15.880]  source that's so pure that it actually turns into purple gas in the atmosphere and so in our own
[03:30:15.880 --> 03:30:21.800]  search to get the purest form we discovered that oil companies and gas drilling companies had a
[03:30:21.800 --> 03:30:26.120]  byproduct that they were selling to pharmaceutical companies and also drug makers they used to make
[03:30:26.120 --> 03:30:32.440]  drugs and once they figure out there's a market they start jacking up the price but we're offering
[03:30:32.440 --> 03:30:37.480]  it still 25 off until it sells out hopefully just like the last time this happened a few years ago
[03:30:37.480 --> 03:30:42.760]  it's not an issue and we do get more but right now we are not able to secure the crystals that

[03:33:00.280 --> 03:33:15.640]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[03:33:18.040 --> 03:33:21.480]  man i gotta get lying along my show more because he just really knows what he's talking about
[03:33:22.520 --> 03:33:26.200]  and i'm not trying to put the president down he's done a lot of good stuff the globalist
[03:33:26.200 --> 03:33:31.080]  hating he's trying to be president he's trying to return power back to america that's good but
[03:33:31.080 --> 03:33:36.680]  doesn't mean he's perfect and we're not running a cult here uh of trump but if we were with hillary
[03:33:36.680 --> 03:33:41.160]  we would already be in a giant war she'd said that was her plan but the same forces are dragging
[03:33:41.160 --> 03:33:45.720]  trump towards it i know liners got more coming up he wants to break down i can't wait to hear it but
[03:33:45.720 --> 03:33:52.200]  finishing up here with linel before he takes over you've heard my take on this the doctor says
[03:33:52.200 --> 03:33:58.680]  last year we now learn i remember it's on the news president trump's on propitia to stop hair loss
[03:33:59.640 --> 03:34:07.400]  and that violates the HIPAA that violates the the doctor-patient relationship just like between
[03:34:07.400 --> 03:34:13.320]  a lawyer and a client and my dad's a physician i mean i grew up knowing about that i see it
[03:34:13.320 --> 03:34:18.360]  in the news all the time people released tiny medical records of you know brad pitts baby and
[03:34:18.360 --> 03:34:23.000]  and you should they get five years in prison ten years in prison that's something we've all been
[03:34:23.000 --> 03:34:26.680]  you know you know taught about even with employment where you've got people's insurance and sometimes
[03:34:26.680 --> 03:34:30.920]  insurance companies call you to ask a question about hey a sentence there you don't say anything
[03:34:30.920 --> 03:34:34.440]  to the insurance company you get them on the phone with the employee uh and that this is
[03:34:34.440 --> 03:34:38.680]  dangerous stuff you don't talk about people's private medical records so the doctor does this
[03:34:40.280 --> 03:34:46.200]  and then a year later he goes i feel raped they came the day after i talked about his propitia
[03:34:46.200 --> 03:34:52.760]  and we'll play the clip right here and i feel raped i guess the whole me too thing so i guess now
[03:34:53.320 --> 03:34:57.240]  he here he is defaming the president saying i feel raped by men coming and taking this
[03:34:58.520 --> 03:35:04.600]  he called it a raid right up right up the bat alex would you pick this guy as your
[03:35:04.600 --> 03:35:09.240]  physician seriously i mean just look at him let me just say something we live in new york city
[03:35:09.240 --> 03:35:14.520]  where we have great physicians as you can imagine what is he with the oakridge boys who is at
[03:35:14.520 --> 03:35:21.000]  billy lee golden whatever i what i'm asking the question is is you know i wouldn't this guy looks
[03:35:21.000 --> 03:35:25.480]  like he's a grateful dead deadhead like he took five thousand hits of acid i'm not saying he did
[03:35:25.480 --> 03:35:30.040]  he acts like his brain's wiped so i think this is a strike against trump that he's got bozo the
[03:35:30.040 --> 03:35:36.600]  clown as his physician well okay that's number one number two you could have had so many physicians
[03:35:36.600 --> 03:35:42.120]  out there who would have had by the way so many degrees and and plaques on the wall you couldn't
[03:35:42.120 --> 03:35:48.040]  see any color to the wall this this is this is sparse at best because i go for visuals and optics
[03:35:48.040 --> 03:35:53.400]  i'm sorry but the next thing is is that while there may not be in law and by the way keep
[03:35:53.400 --> 03:35:59.240]  this in mind depending upon your jurisdiction there is not necessarily the physician patient
[03:35:59.240 --> 03:36:08.360]  privilege in in terms of of courtroom privileges like husband and wife there is still within the
[03:36:08.360 --> 03:36:13.800]  regular laws and the the regulatory administrative rules of it some rules as well let me tell you
[03:36:13.800 --> 03:36:19.800]  something about hippa how bad hippa is hippa is the most draconian though very very good
[03:36:19.800 --> 03:36:25.080]  do you know alex there was a case one time where there was a police officer who walked into an
[03:36:25.080 --> 03:36:31.960]  emergency room actually doing his job it was an emergency came in and he had his body camera
[03:36:31.960 --> 03:36:38.680]  thing on they were freaked out that maybe this showed either what you can see in the term of deterrent
[03:36:38.680 --> 03:36:45.880]  criminals or people who were there hippas huge now did trump authorize him to do this if hot if
[03:36:45.880 --> 03:36:52.600]  trump didn't say hey listen go ahead moon dog oh my god not no we know he did because trump got mad
[03:36:52.600 --> 03:36:59.320]  the next day and had his red medical records pulled so you're seeing the loosest the most
[03:36:59.320 --> 03:37:05.240]  amateurish you i mean you were in the fight of your life you're at the highest echelon say what
[03:37:05.240 --> 03:37:11.480]  you want about obama or hillary i don't think they would have done that this is very very loose but
[03:37:11.480 --> 03:37:17.000]  also here's the thing which always bothers me you know trump would i'd be the alex whenever
[03:37:17.000 --> 03:37:22.440]  trump does something people say ah that's his genius that's that 4d chest i'm thinking wait a
[03:37:22.440 --> 03:37:26.760]  minute what are you talking about i'm going to tell you what i would tell him he's got a tight
[03:37:26.760 --> 03:37:34.920]  in the ranks here and also there's this thing i want to tell him alex i've known that this
[03:37:34.920 --> 03:37:40.120]  he has been in new york fixture for years he has been in the news he used to pick up the phone
[03:37:40.120 --> 03:37:45.320]  sometimes and if he wanted to plan something hell he'd call that himself he was the darling
[03:37:45.320 --> 03:37:51.080]  blessed never ever there was no repercussions as long as his name was in the paper so this is
[03:37:51.080 --> 03:37:59.080]  the mindset you're the president now and i can't say this enough read this 18 usc 1001 you don't
[03:37:59.080 --> 03:38:05.400]  have to be under oath if you in any way mislead anybody in the government if he talked to somebody
[03:38:05.400 --> 03:38:12.760]  if there was somebody an agent asking him questions who knows and you have somebody on tv going back
[03:38:12.760 --> 03:38:18.200]  to juliana he's saying oh no that's a bunch of bs no that's story that they're going to use that
[03:38:18.200 --> 03:38:23.080]  to say he's a liar let's talk about the doctor though let's show this this is show how they're
[03:38:23.080 --> 03:38:26.920]  no you're right how they're stretching everything how they're doing how they're turning everything
[03:38:26.920 --> 03:38:32.280]  into something the doctor looks like releases medical records without authorization at least
[03:38:32.280 --> 03:38:35.480]  the propitial part so the next day trump sends people to get his records which are allowed to
[03:38:35.480 --> 03:38:41.080]  do under law your records belong to you and then the media turns this into he says he feels raped
[03:38:41.080 --> 03:38:51.160]  here it is i feel raped that's how i feel raped right we started a little bit late
[03:38:51.160 --> 03:38:56.200]  back it up back it up i want people to hear this very can we slow this down five times
[03:38:56.200 --> 03:39:13.800]  just a part about raped let me slow it down i feel raped i feel raped
[03:39:13.800 --> 03:39:31.480]  i said i couldn't believe anybody was making a big deal about a drug that's to grow to grow his hair
[03:39:31.480 --> 03:39:40.360]  which seemed to be so important and it certainly is not a breach of medical trust to tell somebody
[03:39:40.360 --> 03:39:47.240]  they take propitial and grow their hair what's the matter with that i was completely surprised
[03:39:47.240 --> 03:39:52.760]  i said that's enough he's saying what's the matter i i released that he's on this drug any of it's a
[03:39:52.760 --> 03:39:57.880]  federal violation and i agree it's our private information he says what's the big deal here let's
[03:39:57.880 --> 03:40:03.480]  finish it up in real time they came and they took the records i feel raped boo boo i feel sad
[03:40:03.480 --> 03:40:07.080]  but you know what the propit do you know what the propitial connection is what are the side of
[03:40:07.080 --> 03:40:12.920]  erectile dysfunction right so what they're doing is so what you've done is you've just given uh
[03:40:12.920 --> 03:40:20.680]  steven colbert's 1 000 writers and you've given them now more fodder you you volunteered something
[03:40:20.680 --> 03:40:25.560]  that you didn't have to mention what are you kathy griffin she broke me you're gonna break
[03:40:25.560 --> 03:40:31.720]  into that one next so here was a situation with all the you know at for uh whatever you do do no
[03:40:31.720 --> 03:40:37.640]  harm it's a hypocritical how about say nothing nobody was putting a gun to his head no but i
[03:40:37.640 --> 03:40:42.360]  totally agree all i'm saying is this is a nothing story but it shows how they take a doctor leaking
[03:40:42.360 --> 03:40:47.880]  his medical information that's a crime on the face of it with now trump's a rapist and can't get a
[03:40:47.880 --> 03:40:51.960]  hard on it's it just shows how they take the littlest thing and then twist it here let's play
[03:40:51.960 --> 03:40:55.560]  what he actually said in real time and then what you mentioned from them making fun of the erectile
[03:40:55.560 --> 03:41:04.920]  dysfunction which doesn't exist they're just saying it here it is i feel raped that's how i feel
[03:41:04.920 --> 03:41:14.760]  raped frightened i feel raped by this guy and sad sad i couldn't believe anybody was making a big
[03:41:14.760 --> 03:41:21.640]  deal about a drug that's to grow to grow his hair which seemed to be so important and it certainly
[03:41:21.640 --> 03:41:26.360]  is not a breach of medical trust to tell somebody they take rapesia to grow their hair really what's
[03:41:26.360 --> 03:41:32.760]  the matter with that i was completely surprised the morning or two after the story about his hair
[03:41:33.800 --> 03:41:40.520]  ran she said so you want it to be the white house doctor forget it you're out what exactly
[03:41:40.520 --> 03:41:46.200]  were they looking for well as medical records as pictures anything i could find must have been here
[03:41:46.200 --> 03:41:51.720]  again this guy just leaked the medical stuff violence federal admits oh that's the big deal i did it
[03:41:51.720 --> 03:41:57.880]  and now he's pissed that the victim wants his medical records and what would have possibly
[03:41:57.880 --> 03:42:03.960]  motivated this man after all he's said and done so far it doesn't he have a friend that says
[03:42:04.680 --> 03:42:11.800]  don't say anything have has he ever said ever i got a better one for your for your team find
[03:42:11.800 --> 03:42:17.720]  him ever saying i can't answer that i can't answer that question this is privilege communication
[03:42:17.720 --> 03:42:21.080]  you're going to talk about it all when you take over on the other side but first here they are
[03:42:21.080 --> 03:42:27.560]  talking about it he sent a white house employee to go through to to rob someone as far as we can
[03:42:27.560 --> 03:42:34.120]  tell i mean that's that's what this would be me think i yes may me yeah may me think about those
[03:42:34.120 --> 03:42:40.760]  tax returns we can't see the tax returns he doesn't want people to see stuff that gives stuff you
[03:42:40.760 --> 03:42:45.160]  don't want to know his medical records you dumb witch he doesn't want them to see the tax returns

[03:47:38.840 --> 03:47:42.440]  finish a couple of things that we said before because you know what alex is so
[03:47:44.360 --> 03:47:48.280]  it's so wonderful knowing that somebody can think of about 20 different things to say
[03:47:49.000 --> 03:47:53.160]  and i'm not the only one because sometimes people say what are you doing would you would you stick
[03:47:53.160 --> 03:47:59.800]  to one subject would you quit would you quit stick to one would you quit going off and say no i'm
[03:47:59.800 --> 03:48:05.240]  not going off there's a lot to be said i mentioned this one particular statue and i can't say this
[03:48:05.240 --> 03:48:09.720]  enough and i and i'm going to go back to the rooty thing because when i saw this i i was
[03:48:09.720 --> 03:48:18.600]  understruck and uh and uh amazed 18 usc 1001 statements or entries generally listen to this
[03:48:20.040 --> 03:48:26.760]  whoever in any matter in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive legislative
[03:48:26.760 --> 03:48:34.600]  or judicial branch of the government knowingly and willfully falsifies conceals or
[03:48:34.600 --> 03:48:40.200]  covers up by trick scheme or device makes any material false fictitious or statement
[03:48:40.200 --> 03:48:46.920]  make a long story short shall be fined by not more than five years in the federal prison meaning
[03:48:47.640 --> 03:48:54.120]  if you mislead doesn't matter necessarily that you're under oath now i want to go back to this
[03:48:54.120 --> 03:49:02.040]  doctor thing just for one second first on so many levels how is it that this man would say
[03:49:02.040 --> 03:49:11.480]  i'm going to tell all of my patients all of the people that go to me that your information is not
[03:49:12.520 --> 03:49:20.680]  is not protected if if indeed i'm not going to protect the president if i'm not going to hold
[03:49:20.680 --> 03:49:29.560]  his personal information uh sacrosanct privilege as i should why would i do yours if i'm going to
[03:49:29.560 --> 03:49:38.440]  give in and reveal things and act this befuddled with a patient a patient of a lifetime for the
[03:49:38.440 --> 03:49:43.240]  rest of my life i'll be able to say you know i'm the president's personal physician you know what
[03:49:43.240 --> 03:49:50.040]  that does in terms of cachet in terms of clout to say that you're the president's personal
[03:49:50.040 --> 03:49:56.840]  physician and nothing you most people would let nothing get in the way of that so instead of
[03:49:56.840 --> 03:50:03.640]  of doing everything to maintain that for nothing more than just personal commercial reasons this
[03:50:03.640 --> 03:50:10.520]  man says no no no no i'm going to violate this hippo laws are so monumentally important i think
[03:50:10.520 --> 03:50:18.360]  we've we've stated this look let me just tell you this much remember the old days maybe you
[03:50:18.920 --> 03:50:25.000]  recall the days when you go to a to an old-fashioned grocery store there'd be a pyramid of oranges like
[03:50:25.000 --> 03:50:30.120]  in the produce section and if you walked up to that pyramid of all these beautifully stacked
[03:50:30.120 --> 03:50:37.400]  oranges if you pick that one in the middle sometimes everything's fine but the wrong one
[03:50:37.400 --> 03:50:47.240]  it all comes tumbling down i promise you that all the president has to do and he how this team
[03:50:47.240 --> 03:50:57.160]  grabs what i say so fast and provides a a gif or a gift or whatever amazingly but if he were to
[03:50:57.960 --> 03:51:03.640]  do the following if you're somewhere and and you will be there one day and you look at your phone
[03:51:03.640 --> 03:51:09.960]  and people will be calling you and you realize that hillary clinton has been taken into custody
[03:51:09.960 --> 03:51:15.720]  or that hillary clinton will be charged or that the grand jury in west virginia or wherever
[03:51:15.720 --> 03:51:25.160]  has indicted hillary wadham clinton the oven mitt fashion east okay you you will have to sit down
[03:51:26.040 --> 03:51:34.040]  i will have to have resuscitation the entire mainstream media will be paralyzed will flinter
[03:51:34.040 --> 03:51:43.000]  racial matter go down the list they won't know what to do they will completely be there would be
[03:51:43.000 --> 03:51:52.440]  such a free song of activity they would be apoplectic and all of this this focus that was on the
[03:51:52.440 --> 03:52:00.040]  president will be on the beloved on this this patron saint of whatever because every single
[03:52:00.040 --> 03:52:04.280]  thing i want you to listen very carefully every single thing that we're doing today every bit
[03:52:04.280 --> 03:52:09.480]  about the russian investigation or the russian collusion or the trump is or that and the dossier
[03:52:09.480 --> 03:52:15.080]  and everything call me muller all of it has to do with hillary clinton trying to justify
[03:52:15.800 --> 03:52:23.800]  losing a rigged election every single thing everything that we're doing stems from that
[03:52:24.440 --> 03:52:30.920]  she is still not only not disappointed in herself but disappointed with you and i guess the country
[03:52:30.920 --> 03:52:36.680]  now the next thing that will happen once she's charged and if i could pick something i am telling
[03:52:36.680 --> 03:52:39.960]  you what would be the most important and most critical would be something about being the
[03:52:39.960 --> 03:52:44.920]  clinton foundation the clinton global initiative or the clinton health access initiative and the
[03:52:44.920 --> 03:52:53.800]  reason for that is because the laws the laws regarding these these graphics are killing me
[03:52:53.800 --> 03:53:02.040]  the laws regarding charitable institutions are like are so brutal do you know that this was
[03:53:02.040 --> 03:53:08.520]  started in what 97 they haven't had maybe an an an audit the clinton foundation maybe ever
[03:53:08.520 --> 03:53:13.480]  in 20 years now i know it doesn't sound exciting because there's all types of you know discussions
[03:53:13.480 --> 03:53:20.280]  of a child of you know trafficking and pedophilia and and servers being smashed believe me when i
[03:53:20.280 --> 03:53:26.200]  tell you now the next step is after she's charged with us and they go after the various people they
[03:53:26.200 --> 03:53:33.320]  go to people like the sorrows and the billgate types and the ross child and they say listen
[03:53:33.320 --> 03:53:39.880]  let me ask you a question you know you contributed to her didn't you yes you're involved in this yes
[03:53:39.880 --> 03:53:45.240]  not only that pension funds countries it is estimated by some be about a hundred billion
[03:53:45.240 --> 03:53:53.240]  dollars the entire this this criminal conspiracy if you will that makes the it it makes the game
[03:53:53.240 --> 03:53:59.160]  being a crime family look like the junior league in comparison now if you went and said i want you
[03:53:59.160 --> 03:54:05.000]  to do me a favor and we will let you off the hook whoever you big shots are disabuse yourself of her
[03:54:06.200 --> 03:54:12.520]  disengage from her throw her under the bus we will leave you alone because everything
[03:54:12.520 --> 03:54:16.680]  that you're going to be facing right now has to do with your affiliation with and to her
[03:54:16.680 --> 03:54:25.640]  her if they say it's a deal that's the end of it all now at the same time people like whole bear
[03:54:25.640 --> 03:54:31.880]  and jimmy found not to be found but uh uh uh kimmel and others and you name it will be seeking
[03:54:31.880 --> 03:54:36.840]  grief counselors they'll have their own little puppies but they go into quiet rooms because
[03:54:37.720 --> 03:54:43.320]  this woman who represents everything to them for reasons i don't ever understand is finally
[03:54:43.320 --> 03:54:50.920]  being charged and you will see rats jumping off of this sinking ship that is critical believe me
[03:54:50.920 --> 03:54:58.440]  when i tell you this it will throw them for a loop because every single day that this president has
[03:54:58.440 --> 03:55:05.720]  to play defensive every single day that he has to parry and thrust and try to ward off some blow
[03:55:05.720 --> 03:55:11.400]  he takes away from the duty that he owes us pursuant to his article two responsibilities
[03:55:11.400 --> 03:55:18.840]  is hillary clinton is critical that's it and what he does is he simply does this he brings
[03:55:18.840 --> 03:55:23.480]  everybody into his office and he says now i want you to listen to me and listen good
[03:55:24.280 --> 03:55:28.120]  i'm going to tell you this and you might think this is untoward you might think oh i really
[03:55:28.120 --> 03:55:33.480]  can't do this but believe me i can i know a little bit about this i want you to tell me
[03:55:33.480 --> 03:55:41.480]  when the first indictment is available and if whoever says well we're not going to do that
[03:55:42.040 --> 03:55:49.000]  or we've exhausted that investigation or it's it's better if we don't you're fired let me make
[03:55:49.000 --> 03:55:55.640]  that clear whoever says we can't do that shouldn't do that it wouldn't be in the best interest of
[03:55:55.640 --> 03:56:02.520]  justice anything roughly resembling what i just told you is gone now let's start with you when
[03:56:02.520 --> 03:56:08.040]  are you going to bring me something what do you have for me i am the president i'm a judge of the
[03:56:08.040 --> 03:56:14.920]  executive you work for me there's nothing new to this believe me when i tell you this believe me
[03:56:14.920 --> 03:56:21.720]  they won't know what to do and hillary clinton will come out and try to song and dance and she
[03:56:21.720 --> 03:56:28.920]  will look at you and look at these people and she will say you don't understand who i am you don't
[03:56:28.920 --> 03:56:35.000]  understand who i am to which the department of justice will respond you don't understand who he
[03:56:35.000 --> 03:56:43.960]  is we've tried everything you and remember clinton foundation bring in you know bubba too as well
[03:56:44.680 --> 03:56:49.320]  and chelsea better be very careful because she's signing on to things that is the answer to all

[03:58:47.320 --> 03:58:51.720]  and i got some bad news for the second time in the five and a half year history of survival
[03:58:51.720 --> 03:58:58.040]  shield x2 our flagship product we are having supply chain problems and this may be the last batch
[03:58:58.040 --> 03:59:04.200]  of this we have deep earth crystal source that's so pure that it actually turns into purple gas
[03:59:04.200 --> 03:59:10.120]  in the atmosphere and so in our own search to get the purest form we discovered that oil companies
[03:59:10.120 --> 03:59:14.680]  and gas drilling companies had a byproduct that they were selling to pharmaceutical companies
[03:59:14.680 --> 03:59:18.760]  and also drug makers they used to make drugs and once they figure out there's a market
[03:59:18.760 --> 03:59:25.400]  they start jacking up the price but we're offering it still 25 off until it sells out
[03:59:25.400 --> 03:59:29.080]  hopefully just like the last time this happened a few years ago it's not an issue and we do get
[03:59:29.080 --> 03:59:34.920]  more but right now we are not able to secure the crystals that produce the purest iodine
[03:59:34.920 --> 03:59:40.680]  in the world but what it does is for stamina libido focus energy is really amazing survival
