[00:00:01.437 --> 00:00:04.320]  They took my saddle in Houston.
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.384]  Broke my leg in Santa Fe.
[00:00:09.384 --> 00:00:15.889]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way.
[00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:22.735]  I'll be looking for aid when they pull that gate.
[00:00:22.735 --> 00:00:25.136]  And I hope that judge ain't blind.
[00:00:25.136 --> 00:00:29.260]  I'm a rebel by morning.
[00:00:39.646 --> 00:00:47.110]  An Islamic terrorist mowed down numerous victims in a car before stabbing a police officer and trying to attack the Parliament in London.
[00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.951]  And how did the left respond?
[00:00:48.951 --> 00:00:50.833]  By expressing their concerns.
[00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:54.715]  Not for the victims, but for how it might make Muslims look bad.
[00:00:54.935 --> 00:00:57.717]  In moments, Donald Trump will begin exploiting the attack in London today.
[00:00:57.717 --> 00:01:00.739]  Do not allow this to be an indictment on Islam or Muslims.
[00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.523]  Far-right figures like Tommy Robinson are vile opportunists, using victims of today's attack to spread their anti-Muslim message.
[00:01:06.523 --> 00:01:07.023]  That's right.
[00:01:07.023 --> 00:01:14.989]  Some members of the media were more upset that Tommy Robinson had showed up to the scene of the attack than the attack itself.
[00:01:14.989 --> 00:01:17.991]  But at least London Mayor Sadiq Khan was quick to respond.
[00:01:18.524 --> 00:01:19.225]  Oh no, that's right.
[00:01:19.225 --> 00:01:22.067]  It took him more than five hours to appear on camera.
[00:01:22.067 --> 00:01:24.990]  Trump's ignorant view of Islam could make both our countries less safe.
[00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.232]  It risks alienating mainstream Muslims.
[00:01:27.232 --> 00:01:29.114]  London has proved him wrong!
[00:01:29.114 --> 00:01:31.656]  Yeah, that tweet hasn't aged well, has it?
[00:01:31.656 --> 00:01:35.500]  But at least none of them were stupid enough to blame Donald Trump, right?
[00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.402]  Trump probably has a hand in this!
[00:01:37.842 --> 00:01:45.045]  Yeah, okay, but it's important to remember that hashtag not all Muslims are terrorists and that Muslims don't support this.
[00:01:45.045 --> 00:01:49.047]  Here's a screenshot from France24 Arabic's live video feed.
[00:01:49.047 --> 00:01:51.768]  Note the smiley faces and the thumbs up.
[00:01:51.768 --> 00:01:57.510]  They're saying, quote, God curse the infidels and, quote, that's how the lone wolves of Allah operate.
[00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.951]  Here's a screenshot from Al Jazeera Live.
[00:01:59.951 --> 00:02:01.331]  I'm watching Al Jazeera Live.
[00:02:01.331 --> 00:02:03.412]  You wouldn't believe the number of likes.
[00:02:03.412 --> 00:02:05.493]  Well done and Allah Akbar.
[00:02:05.493 --> 00:02:07.554]  Here's a moderate Muslim perspective.
[00:02:07.714 --> 00:02:10.715]  I'm seeing rumblings that what's going on in London is an attack from radical Islam.
[00:02:10.715 --> 00:02:12.836]  If so, there was likely good reason for it!
[00:02:12.836 --> 00:02:15.357]  But hashtag not all Muslims, right?
[00:02:15.357 --> 00:02:18.958]  These cowardly bastards can maim, murder and terrorise all they like, but they'll never win.
[00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:25.320]  If by winning, you mean changing society, then they are winning, with the full complicity of the left.
[00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.684]  Canada is currently debating a motion that will effectively criminalize Islamophobia.
[00:02:30.684 --> 00:02:32.986]  In other words, criticism of Islam.
[00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:38.211]  Just three years after their own parliament was also attacked by an Islamic terrorist.
[00:02:38.211 --> 00:02:39.272]  They are winning.
[00:02:39.272 --> 00:02:42.455]  And our governments are helping this ideology to spread.
[00:02:42.455 --> 00:02:43.876]  They're welcoming it in.
[00:02:43.876 --> 00:02:47.779]  We're erecting glass walls around the frigging Eiffel Tower.
[00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:52.303]  Sweden just allowed 150 ISIS terrorists back into their country.
[00:02:52.363 --> 00:02:59.148]  Oh, but don't worry, because they set up a phone hotline for people to report them and then closed it down because it might be racist.
[00:02:59.148 --> 00:03:08.335]  Now we have the Islamist Erdogan threatening to send Muslim migrants with the vow that Europeans won't be able to walk safely on the streets.
[00:03:08.335 --> 00:03:12.518]  France just polled young Muslims and found that a third of them, a third,
[00:03:13.178 --> 00:03:15.079]  Express sympathy for terrorism.
[00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:17.100]  Here are a few questions that spring to mind.
[00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:25.183]  Why are Brits being arrested for tweets while Islamists are free to walk around Parliament draped in the ISIS flag?
[00:03:25.183 --> 00:03:29.444]  Why do we have a mayor who called moderate Muslims Uncle Toms?
[00:03:29.444 --> 00:03:34.486]  A mayor who says terrorist attacks are part and parcel of living in a major city.
[00:03:34.486 --> 00:03:36.967]  And I'm sick to the back teeth of saying it.
[00:03:37.307 --> 00:03:39.029]  But I'll say it again.
[00:03:39.029 --> 00:03:41.691]  Pray for hashtags won't prevent this.
[00:03:41.691 --> 00:03:45.255]  Turning off the lights at the Eiffel Tower won't prevent this.
[00:03:45.255 --> 00:03:49.859]  Putting a filter on your Facebook profile pic won't prevent this.
[00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:56.245]  Sticking your head in the sand and pointing the finger at right-wingers will not prevent this.
[00:03:56.465 --> 00:04:03.107]  And whether this terrorist turns out to be homegrown or a migrant or whatever, the belief system is the same.
[00:04:03.107 --> 00:04:11.270]  Acknowledging that Islam is not a religion of peace and is in serious need of imminent reform will prevent this.
[00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:16.491]  So don't intimidate and attack the Muslim reformists who are trying to make that happen.
[00:04:16.491 --> 00:04:24.554]  Not rolling out a red carpet into our country to be exploited by terrorists as they've done over and over again.
[00:04:25.114 --> 00:04:26.735]  We'll prevent this.
[00:04:26.735 --> 00:04:44.288]  How many more mangled bodies on our streets will it take before that happens?
[00:04:44.288 --> 00:04:49.512]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Thursday the 23rd day of March 2017.
[00:04:49.512 --> 00:04:54.336]  I'm your host Alex Jones and we're going to kick off an incredibly
[00:04:54.985 --> 00:04:56.132]  Important.
[00:04:56.132 --> 00:04:57.561]  Transmission.
[00:04:57.561 --> 00:04:57.984]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.222 --> 00:05:04.024]  The health care reform hearing on the Hill today has been a clown act.
[00:05:04.024 --> 00:05:15.468]  You have Democrats taking the podium to passionately complain about the new health care bill, saying it's the worst ever, when it's still government-controlled health care, which is what they cheered for seven years ago, and still today.
[00:05:15.468 --> 00:05:18.229]  I'm beginning to think this was yet another Trump troll.
[00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:26.092]  Make Democrats stop progress of a GOP health care bill that's virtually the same bill they complained the GOP was stopping the progress of.
[00:05:26.092 --> 00:05:28.053]  The epitome of partisan politics.
[00:05:28.633 --> 00:05:34.976]  Democrats are also complaining they haven't seen the bill, but here was Nancy Pelosi when fighting for Obamacare.
[00:05:34.976 --> 00:05:40.018]  But we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it.
[00:05:40.018 --> 00:05:45.460]  She's having hearings today, trying to stop the new health care bill, complaining she hasn't seen it.
[00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.901]  What an absolute fraud.
[00:05:47.901 --> 00:05:51.202]  Just chalk this up to more fallout from Obama fail.
[00:05:51.202 --> 00:05:55.544]  Trump is meeting with the House Freedom Caucus today, who could stall the bill in the House.
[00:05:55.544 --> 00:05:58.045]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[00:06:00.151 --> 00:06:01.992]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[00:06:01.992 --> 00:06:08.596]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:06:08.596 --> 00:06:11.757]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:11.757 --> 00:06:21.523]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great-tasting formula.
[00:06:21.523 --> 00:06:22.383]  Caveman.
[00:06:22.383 --> 00:06:27.446]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[00:06:27.446 --> 00:06:29.567]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[00:06:29.847 --> 00:06:33.008]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:06:33.008 --> 00:06:38.151]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[00:06:38.151 --> 00:06:46.294]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[00:06:46.294 --> 00:06:54.078]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[00:06:54.078 --> 00:06:58.900]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself and forestlife.com today.
[00:06:59.767 --> 00:07:08.052]  Please listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the info war.
[00:07:08.052 --> 00:07:09.272]  A 360 win.
[00:07:09.272 --> 00:07:15.836]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at infowarshore.com.
[00:07:15.836 --> 00:07:23.360]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip, because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:28.844]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[00:07:28.844 --> 00:07:34.948]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[00:07:34.948 --> 00:07:42.733]  Just go to InfoWarsTore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[00:07:42.733 --> 00:07:49.938]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new auto ship feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[00:07:49.938 --> 00:07:50.739]  10% off on auto ship.
[00:07:50.899 --> 00:07:53.341]  Win-win-win at Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:53.341 --> 00:07:55.322]  Free shipping on orders above 50 bucks.
[00:07:55.322 --> 00:08:02.528]  And all out-of-stock items are never out-of-stock when you sign up for auto-ship.
[00:08:02.528 --> 00:08:10.254]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:28.698 --> 00:08:34.001]  It's Thursday, the 23rd day of March 2017.
[00:08:34.001 --> 00:08:38.744]  Here are the different quadrants of news that we have.
[00:08:38.744 --> 00:08:43.347]  We have the high drama for the Obamacare vote coming up.
[00:08:43.347 --> 00:08:50.451]  We have over a million Americans at risk of being nuked by North Korea.
[00:08:52.335 --> 00:09:03.139]  We have, obviously the really big news, the London attack yesterday that the British Parliament is saying is not Islamic and religion has nothing to do with it.
[00:09:03.139 --> 00:09:09.962]  That's lawmakers on the floor of the British Parliament today.
[00:09:09.962 --> 00:09:15.263]  We also have news trying to censor that it's Islamic, just like when illegal aliens that are 18 years old in
[00:09:18.834 --> 00:09:22.378]  High schools, as freshmen, reportedly rape people.
[00:09:22.378 --> 00:09:24.900]  It's not picked up by any of the major news media either.
[00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.102]  This is the political correctness, the cover-up.
[00:09:27.102 --> 00:09:29.425]  We're going to get into all of this and more.
[00:09:29.425 --> 00:09:40.456]  Of course, the attacks happened yesterday on the first anniversary of the Brussels bombing that our reporters covered in Belgium and were run out of major areas of that city.
[00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:42.821]  As no-go zones.
[00:09:42.821 --> 00:09:45.703]  And the media says it's a conspiracy theory and there's no such thing.
[00:09:45.703 --> 00:09:50.686]  And then Paul Watson put out a bounty for any reporter to actually go there and see for themselves.
[00:09:50.686 --> 00:09:52.547]  And the reporter went there and they tried to beat him up.
[00:09:52.547 --> 00:09:54.408]  And he said, okay, I was a big liberal.
[00:09:54.408 --> 00:09:55.669]  I didn't believe Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:09:55.669 --> 00:09:56.850]  That just happened a month ago.
[00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:59.451]  He's right.
[00:09:59.451 --> 00:10:00.912]  Incredible.
[00:10:00.912 --> 00:10:02.753]  And of course we have the huge news.
[00:10:02.753 --> 00:10:09.017]  We have the Democratic Party coming out in organized fashion.
[00:10:10.089 --> 00:10:14.830]  And calling for national emergency and martial law to overthrow President Trump.
[00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:27.834]  And you have the former deputy head of the Defense Department, who for two months has been making the rounds in Washington, normalizing open criminal martial law to overthrow an elected president.
[00:10:27.834 --> 00:10:30.674]  Because they don't have the impeachment votes.
[00:10:30.674 --> 00:10:32.475]  To allow them to continue to organize
[00:10:35.575 --> 00:10:45.181]  I mean, if I was going around as a citizen at the Pentagon saying, let's overthrow the president, I would be arrested in hours, and I should be.
[00:10:45.181 --> 00:11:01.330]  You have the former deputy head of the Defense Department, and I covered this months ago, and I said, watch, when they go from talking about civil emergency in their policy papers to civil emergency and martial law on mainstream news, you know they're getting ready to try to move against the president.
[00:11:02.534 --> 00:11:04.978]  And here are the articles where I broke it down in the last few months.
[00:11:04.978 --> 00:11:07.784]  Democrats are organizing a coup against Trump.
[00:11:07.784 --> 00:11:09.246]  The political left are losing their minds.
[00:11:10.384 --> 00:11:11.344]  Because they won't get away with this.
[00:11:11.344 --> 00:11:13.625]  This all needs to be sent again to President Trump.
[00:11:13.625 --> 00:11:14.245]  Emergency!
[00:11:14.245 --> 00:11:17.086]  Trump must go on offensive to stop Democrat plan for martial law.
[00:11:17.086 --> 00:11:25.570]  I break down these two reports, how they'll start calling for civil emergency, then they'll activate all the Soros riot gangs to start burning cities.
[00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:29.711]  And now they've got Time Magazine Newsweek calling for the case for rioting.
[00:11:29.711 --> 00:11:32.712]  They've got all the major news fomenting and organizing it.
[00:11:32.712 --> 00:11:33.112]  Breaking!
[00:11:33.112 --> 00:11:34.973]  Democrats organizing criminal coup against Trump.
[00:11:36.556 --> 00:11:38.077]  February 2nd.
[00:11:38.077 --> 00:11:39.317]  I just keep warning everybody.
[00:11:39.317 --> 00:11:40.298]  National emergency.
[00:11:40.298 --> 00:11:46.621]  CNN urges press to blame Trump for the win on Russia.
[00:11:46.621 --> 00:11:52.244]  Journalists are afraid to say so because they're going to sound quote partisan.
[00:11:52.244 --> 00:11:54.806]  That's old news and they begin to hype it and push it.
[00:11:54.806 --> 00:11:57.687]  Trump's entities Rosie O'Donnell calls for martial law.
[00:11:57.687 --> 00:11:59.068]  This is organized.
[00:12:00.342 --> 00:12:10.906]  White House Dems holding up Trump cabinet picks and openly saying because they're going to kick him out of office and don't want anybody to be in the new government.
[00:12:10.906 --> 00:12:12.606]  The establishment plan to stop President Trump.
[00:12:12.606 --> 00:12:15.287]  Democrats installing chaos on all fronts.
[00:12:15.287 --> 00:12:16.728]  Infowars.com.
[00:12:16.728 --> 00:12:18.188]  Then we lay out their plan to do it.
[00:12:18.188 --> 00:12:19.449]  January 14th.
[00:12:19.449 --> 00:12:21.589]  Very important article.
[00:12:21.589 --> 00:12:29.072]  I talk about how they're going to disrupt, how they're going to create a civil emergency, how they're going to call for martial law, and then they all start doing it.
[00:12:30.438 --> 00:12:36.024]  Because I've studied what they've done in the Arab Spring, what they've done in Ukraine, what they've done overthrowing other elected governments.
[00:12:36.024 --> 00:12:53.042]  Rogue elements of the CIA, the big foundations, Carnegie, Ford, Rockefeller, you name it, with Soros and others, the usual suspects, are publicly organizing an overthrow of this elected president, and on top of it,
[00:12:54.093 --> 00:13:13.360]  They have this special office inside the State Department, the Ministry of Truth that Obama signed on December 6th of last year, as he was a lame duck, hundreds of millions of dollars to fund a CIA group inside the State Department to advise the Board of Governors on enemy Russian media.
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:22.404]  And with no proof then, the former head of the Board of Governors, outgoing head, went on, as you know, C-SPAN and a Congressional Armed Services Committee in the House
[00:13:23.849 --> 00:13:28.652]  And said Infowars is basically a Russian operation.
[00:13:28.652 --> 00:13:34.436]  And now they're saying Congressman Nunes needs to be investigated as a Russian agent.
[00:13:34.436 --> 00:13:36.877]  And now they're saying Senator Paul's a Russian agent.
[00:13:36.877 --> 00:13:41.000]  They're saying you are a Putin agent.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.321]  And they're saying the President is.
[00:13:43.524 --> 00:13:47.867]  And they've been caught again with bots that they've loaded onto computers.
[00:13:47.867 --> 00:13:50.969]  You know, you click on a picture or an article and you get a virus.
[00:13:50.969 --> 00:14:03.918]  And it's even in the Vault 7 leaks that they're targeting President Trump trying to plant Russian software that they've stolen and are using to claim he's working with the Russians.
[00:14:03.918 --> 00:14:08.441]  You don't think some little hacker in his basement released Vault 7 two weeks ago.
[00:14:08.441 --> 00:14:09.922]  That was right out of the White House.
[00:14:09.922 --> 00:14:11.063]  You can bet your bottom dollar.
[00:14:15.879 --> 00:14:21.062]  Or let's just say allies of the return of the republic.
[00:14:21.062 --> 00:14:23.183]  Because it proves everything we're breaking down here.
[00:14:23.183 --> 00:14:24.884]  We're in an information war.
[00:14:24.884 --> 00:14:40.713]  The people claiming that we're Russian agents are the globalist agents that have sold out the sovereignty, that are plunging the economy, that are getting rid of the borders, that are flooding us with third world populations and brainwashing them into anti-western hatred, that are flooding us with islamicists.
[00:14:43.166 --> 00:14:45.167]  So I'm going to break all of that down today in great detail.
[00:14:45.167 --> 00:14:46.908]  We have special guests joining us.
[00:14:46.908 --> 00:14:51.652]  I'm going to go over the specifics of it, but you're getting the absolute key data.
[00:14:51.652 --> 00:14:53.273]  Not my opinion, not my views.
[00:14:53.273 --> 00:14:56.755]  We have studied this like no one else.
[00:14:56.755 --> 00:15:00.998]  COG, Operation Valkyrie.
[00:15:00.998 --> 00:15:04.680]  I just always found it fascinating as a teenager and into college.
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:05.541]  I couldn't put down
[00:15:07.779 --> 00:15:11.081]  Books about espionage and war, and it's just all there.
[00:15:11.081 --> 00:15:16.405]  And when you're watching it, they're doing it in live time, like the public are complete idiots.
[00:15:16.405 --> 00:15:20.687]  And I understand if the President moves too precipitously against them, it'll look like he's being a fascist.
[00:15:20.687 --> 00:15:23.950]  They're calling for him to be murdered in every major newspaper you can imagine.
[00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:27.512]  The comedy shows are all saying he's a racist, and then I tell him how to be a racist.
[00:15:27.512 --> 00:15:29.653]  You know, Alec Baldwin's saying it.
[00:15:29.653 --> 00:15:32.375]  You've got TV shows demonizing yours truly.
[00:15:32.375 --> 00:15:33.896]  Fictional characters everywhere.
[00:15:33.896 --> 00:15:36.238]  They are engaged in total war against the country.
[00:15:37.455 --> 00:16:00.540]  They're saying they're going to foment riots and then civil emergency and martial law and are calling for insurrection inside the government and inside Congress and the overthrow of the president and then, we told you this was coming, FEC dims, again, I, Regulating Drugs Report, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook.
[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:01.421]  Who do we have this from?
[00:16:01.421 --> 00:16:06.942]  Directly from the Federal Election Commission.
[00:16:10.165 --> 00:16:12.766]  And that's what they told us when they banned us off Google Ads, AdRoll.
[00:16:12.766 --> 00:16:15.227]  They said, oh, you're political.
[00:16:15.227 --> 00:16:19.729]  You have to be authorization to run ads because that's political ads under other laws.
[00:16:19.729 --> 00:16:21.610]  I'm not a political ad.
[00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:25.892]  I don't take PAC money.
[00:16:25.892 --> 00:16:37.877]  I'm engaged in the free press promoting the Second Amendment, sovereignty, low taxes, Christian values, stuff that makes us successful, stuff that's effective.
[00:16:38.942 --> 00:16:40.403]  And honorable.
[00:16:40.403 --> 00:16:41.764]  But I told you, that's their argument.
[00:16:41.764 --> 00:16:44.506]  And they're already kicked me off Google.
[00:16:44.506 --> 00:16:46.128]  And kicked us off Google News.
[00:16:46.128 --> 00:16:47.889]  We're not listed as news for five years.
[00:16:47.889 --> 00:16:52.673]  They told us then, oh, we've had some inquiries from the FEC.
[00:16:52.673 --> 00:16:54.294]  The Federal Elections Commission.
[00:16:56.929 --> 00:17:12.396]  Which is going around to every ally of Trump and trying to get Napolitano kicked off the air at Fox, trying to shut down the sponsors of Drudge and Breitbart, and kicking Breitbart off their apps on the iTunes store that are free.
[00:17:12.396 --> 00:17:17.339]  And they're openly in the news saying, shut down Alex Jones.
[00:17:17.339 --> 00:17:21.681]  I was told by high-level sources that, again, just a few months ago, Nancy Pelosi's
[00:17:22.907 --> 00:17:23.448]  I don't know.
[00:17:41.468 --> 00:17:44.750]  Understand, I officially already in D.C.
[00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:49.473]  have Obama and Hillary Clinton out of that command bunker they've got down the street.
[00:17:49.473 --> 00:17:54.536]  They are coming after us, and they don't even hide this up there.
[00:17:54.536 --> 00:17:56.538]  They want us to know.
[00:17:56.538 --> 00:17:59.440]  We're coming after you with lawyers.
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.681]  Get ready.
[00:18:01.681 --> 00:18:10.787]  And they're in the Federal Elections Commission already, outside of law, just racketeering, sending letters to Google and letters to other companies saying, you kick off
[00:18:12.406 --> 00:18:23.515]  Everybody, I mean every libertarian or patriotic or nationalistic news site that I talked to was kicked off AdRoll last month on the same day.
[00:18:23.515 --> 00:18:24.135]  See?
[00:18:24.135 --> 00:18:33.162]  Oh, we're not allowed to advertise supplements on the internet or t-shirts because the Federal Elections Commission said so?
[00:18:33.162 --> 00:18:35.504]  Where are the hearings?
[00:18:35.504 --> 00:18:36.344]  But here's the good news.
[00:18:36.344 --> 00:18:38.206]  I'm gonna skip this break.
[00:18:38.206 --> 00:18:39.547]  Here's the great news.
[00:18:42.301 --> 00:18:50.184]  The people are striking back, and coming up today, we have incredible information.
[00:18:50.184 --> 00:18:59.587]  Congressman Nunes, head of the Intelligence Committee of the House of Representatives, says, obviously, I'm the head of the intelligence community.
[00:18:59.587 --> 00:19:00.768]  I have access to what's going on.
[00:19:03.254 --> 00:19:07.755]  I've had people come to me, and that's folks from the NSA and CIA, and say, sir, here it all is.
[00:19:07.755 --> 00:19:11.456]  Plus, we on Sunday put out the report that no one challenged.
[00:19:11.456 --> 00:19:12.997]  There was just a total news blackout.
[00:19:12.997 --> 00:19:26.381]  I know for a fact people that have been on multiple shows on CBS, NBC, I'm asked not to name the shows because, you know, the people want to be friends with the producers that have them on, but they mention the NSA data of Trump and his family being surveilled by Obama.
[00:19:29.969 --> 00:19:33.651]  And they cut it out of the show and say we can't put classified information on.
[00:19:33.651 --> 00:19:36.513]  We've already been told don't put that out.
[00:19:36.513 --> 00:19:38.935]  Oh yeah, they've already gotten the emails, the talking points.
[00:19:38.935 --> 00:19:40.195]  Do not put that out.
[00:19:40.195 --> 00:19:41.817]  Not it's fake!
[00:19:41.817 --> 00:19:43.157]  That's classified information.
[00:19:43.157 --> 00:19:44.738]  Well the press is the fourth estate.
[00:19:44.738 --> 00:19:46.039]  We're allowed to do that.
[00:19:46.039 --> 00:19:56.526]  That's why even the editor of USA Today said it's dangerous to call Alex Jones a Russian agent and to say he's being investigated for being actually in communication with Russians getting directives and commands.
[00:19:58.803 --> 00:20:03.186]  Yeah, and I get also good orders from Pluto.
[00:20:03.186 --> 00:20:05.708]  And Keebler Elves, too, out in an oak tree out there.
[00:20:05.708 --> 00:20:12.853]  I mean, this is the level, and the USA Today editor said, am I the only one who thinks this is dangerous?
[00:20:12.853 --> 00:20:17.676]  Claiming people that try to talk to WikiLeaks or whatever are Russian agents?
[00:20:17.676 --> 00:20:21.659]  But the good news is, it's gonna go too far.
[00:20:21.659 --> 00:20:23.801]  Because now Lindsey Graham has come out,
[00:20:25.325 --> 00:20:29.288]  And says he's scared, and now knows he meets with a lot of world leaders.
[00:20:29.288 --> 00:20:33.132]  That's what high-level senators do, and diplomats.
[00:20:33.132 --> 00:20:34.893]  Has he been surveilled?
[00:20:34.893 --> 00:20:38.876]  And oh, now the Democrats, they want Nunes investigated.
[00:20:38.876 --> 00:20:41.599]  This is all just intimidation.
[00:20:41.599 --> 00:20:45.422]  Because Nunes dared come out and break their blockade of bull.
[00:20:47.674 --> 00:20:50.976]  Representative Cummings, Nunes should be investigated.
[00:20:50.976 --> 00:20:52.397]  Yes, yes.
[00:20:52.397 --> 00:20:54.598]  Why don't you go as far as John McCain?
[00:20:54.598 --> 00:21:00.741]  Just say, Senator, you work for the Russians.
[00:21:00.741 --> 00:21:03.903]  We're going to go to those clips coming up here in just a little while.
[00:21:03.903 --> 00:21:08.526]  But Nunes claims some Trump transition messages were intercepted.
[00:21:10.498 --> 00:21:11.559]  Duh!
[00:21:11.559 --> 00:21:24.164]  They were all over the news in December and January saying, we have the wiretaps, we have the communications, we have the intercepts with them on the phone with Russians, which they're supposed to be setting up the calls with Russians.
[00:21:24.164 --> 00:21:34.069]  And then they say to Flynn, incoming National Security Advisor, did you talk about sanctions?
[00:21:34.069 --> 00:21:36.790]  He said, no, I just lined up the call for the President.
[00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:37.030]  Oh, really?
[00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:37.991]  I've got a transcript right here.
[00:21:39.586 --> 00:21:44.190]  CNN, New York Times, Washington Post, every paper in the country, oh, we've got them!
[00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:44.971]  They were caught!
[00:21:44.971 --> 00:21:46.592]  And they said, okay, release that transcript.
[00:21:46.592 --> 00:21:49.675]  Well, it's classified.
[00:21:49.675 --> 00:21:57.061]  And then finally Congress sees it, and they go, okay, Nunes says, no phone calls up to Flynn, lining up phone calls, and there's nothing there.
[00:21:57.061 --> 00:21:59.063]  Lining up the phone call.
[00:21:59.063 --> 00:22:00.384]  They said, can we talk about sanctions?
[00:22:00.384 --> 00:22:02.025]  I'm sure the President can talk to you about that.
[00:22:02.025 --> 00:22:04.628]  Who do you think talks to people about sanctions?
[00:22:04.628 --> 00:22:05.749]  The President!
[00:22:06.786 --> 00:22:10.948]  But see how they've worked it now, where the President can't talk to anybody.
[00:22:10.948 --> 00:22:12.769]  Because he's an agent of them.
[00:22:12.769 --> 00:22:13.349]  Why?
[00:22:13.349 --> 00:22:14.710]  Rex Tillerson.
[00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:16.891]  He's going to Russia in a couple weeks.
[00:22:16.891 --> 00:22:18.792]  The Secretary of State's going to Russia?
[00:22:18.792 --> 00:22:20.053]  Yeah, first he's going to China.
[00:22:20.053 --> 00:22:22.554]  Oh, is he going to be a Chinese agent because he went over there?
[00:22:22.554 --> 00:22:28.257]  And the truth is, it's Hillary and all the rest of the globalists.
[00:22:28.257 --> 00:22:29.518]  They're the ones.
[00:22:32.406 --> 00:22:39.447]  That actually were on the communist Chinese payroll, and actually sold out our uranium to the Russians, and actually sold out to anybody that would pay them.
[00:22:39.447 --> 00:22:42.988]  Like a vending machine.
[00:22:42.988 --> 00:22:44.288]  Serious claim!
[00:22:44.288 --> 00:22:46.849]  FBI Comey falsely denied surveillance!
[00:22:46.849 --> 00:22:47.929]  Comey.
[00:22:47.929 --> 00:22:48.869]  Little face.
[00:22:48.869 --> 00:22:51.110]  I'm eight feet tall, so it's okay when I lie to you.
[00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:53.310]  Here's Comey.
[00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:53.830]  No!
[00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:55.311]  No surveillance!
[00:22:55.311 --> 00:22:56.131]  No surveillance!
[00:22:58.729 --> 00:23:03.010]  As if the FBI is one small part of all that surveillance.
[00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:12.133]  As if he doesn't know that any president-elect has every one of their phone calls recorded.
[00:23:12.133 --> 00:23:17.154]  They're on the spot by the executive branch when they're talking to foreign leaders.
[00:23:17.154 --> 00:23:20.155]  That's been the law for decades.
[00:23:20.155 --> 00:23:21.656]  They create transcripts of it.
[00:23:21.656 --> 00:23:26.057]  Remember they were releasing transcripts of President Trump's discussions in the Australian
[00:23:27.742 --> 00:23:28.903]  President did it as well.
[00:23:28.903 --> 00:23:31.224]  Remember all that?
[00:23:31.224 --> 00:23:35.327]  And the Russians released a transcript of the talk with him and Putin?
[00:23:35.327 --> 00:23:38.309]  How do you think there's a transcript, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:23:38.309 --> 00:23:41.371]  It's recorded!
[00:23:41.371 --> 00:23:44.492]  Just like when you have a customer service desk, like we've got.
[00:23:44.492 --> 00:23:45.153]  That's recorded.
[00:23:50.242 --> 00:23:56.745]  Everybody knows that, but they sit there and they just put out such a wall of lies that they think we're idiots.
[00:23:56.745 --> 00:24:04.970]  But the good news is Nunes comes out and just says, look, I mean, I've had a lot of people come to me in the intelligence agencies and then Trump was being spied on.
[00:24:07.776 --> 00:24:11.898]  And that's how they keep these House members, even Intelligence Committee people, in the dark.
[00:24:11.898 --> 00:24:18.002]  That's why it turned out the House Intelligence Committee was being spied on under Obama, and so was Dianne Feinstein and the Senate Intelligence Committee.
[00:24:18.002 --> 00:24:19.202]  Remember how pissed she was?
[00:24:19.202 --> 00:24:22.684]  How dare you CIA spy on me!
[00:24:22.684 --> 00:24:24.065]  Then they played dumb.
[00:24:24.065 --> 00:24:26.787]  Remember it came out the cloakroom was being tapped by the CIA?
[00:24:34.377 --> 00:24:35.978]  You can pull all those articles up.
[00:24:35.978 --> 00:24:37.198]  New York Times, CNN.
[00:24:37.198 --> 00:24:40.820]  But they think you've got a goldfish memory.
[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:46.702]  So Nunes claims Trump transition messages were intercepted within minutes.
[00:24:46.702 --> 00:24:49.343]  We heard Nunes is trying to cover for Trump.
[00:24:49.343 --> 00:24:50.323]  Nunes is an operative.
[00:24:50.323 --> 00:24:51.224]  Nunes, what does he know?
[00:24:51.224 --> 00:24:52.864]  He's just ahead of the Intelligence Committee.
[00:24:52.864 --> 00:24:53.525]  On and on and on.
[00:24:53.525 --> 00:24:56.206]  And now he needs to be investigated.
[00:24:56.206 --> 00:24:57.206]  We've got those clips coming up.
[00:24:59.005 --> 00:25:01.947]  Top Dim calls for investigation into House Intelligence Chairman.
[00:25:01.947 --> 00:25:02.767]  That's right!
[00:25:02.767 --> 00:25:09.611]  How dare him come out and say, we all read it in thousands of newspapers, I'm the head of the Intelligence Committee.
[00:25:09.611 --> 00:25:12.433]  Yes, they're spying.
[00:25:12.433 --> 00:25:14.294]  They said they were.
[00:25:14.294 --> 00:25:20.338]  But Comey, looking so loving and good, there's no spying, not at all.
[00:25:20.338 --> 00:25:22.039]  There's no such thing.
[00:25:22.039 --> 00:25:23.299]  Understand?
[00:25:23.299 --> 00:25:24.100]  I'm Comey.
[00:25:25.393 --> 00:25:30.200]  Meanwhile, Graham, I wonder if my meetings are being surveilled by the intelligence community.
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:34.126]  Senator Lindsey Graham called the revelation disturbing.
[00:25:34.126 --> 00:25:38.352]  That's because they know Trump's got all the data, he's the president, and they really walked into this.
[00:25:38.352 --> 00:25:39.735]  First, they said they were spying on him.
[00:25:39.735 --> 00:25:41.177]  He goes, funny, that's illegal to leak that.
[00:25:42.731 --> 00:25:44.172]  To leak those transcripts.
[00:25:44.172 --> 00:25:45.313]  Oh, you didn't do it.
[00:25:45.313 --> 00:25:46.274]  Okay.
[00:25:46.274 --> 00:25:48.536]  And then everybody knows everybody's being spied on.
[00:25:48.536 --> 00:25:50.998]  So now he's got them all double-caught lying.
[00:25:50.998 --> 00:25:53.019]  And CNN and everybody just kept lying and lying.
[00:25:53.019 --> 00:25:53.920]  It's ridiculous.
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.001]  It never happened.
[00:25:55.001 --> 00:25:55.982]  It never went on.
[00:25:55.982 --> 00:25:58.604]  Are all the presidents going to be impeached?
[00:25:58.604 --> 00:26:01.946]  Anybody that says, you know, that we spy on anybody is going to be impeached.
[00:26:01.946 --> 00:26:05.349]  It's preposterous that anybody ever gets spied on without warrants.
[00:26:05.349 --> 00:26:06.310]  It's preposterous!
[00:26:11.348 --> 00:26:13.611]  It's preposterous to say I'm wearing a blue shirt.
[00:26:13.611 --> 00:26:14.953]  I'm wearing a blue shirt, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:14.953 --> 00:26:15.875]  It's ridiculous!
[00:26:15.875 --> 00:26:17.557]  I'm not wearing a blue shirt!
[00:26:17.557 --> 00:26:23.946]  It's not been in the New York Times hundreds of times they were spying on Trump and admitting it and rubbing their little hands together like rats.
[00:26:23.946 --> 00:26:25.889]  No, we didn't do anything.
[00:26:25.889 --> 00:26:27.632]  We never did one single thing!
[00:26:29.482 --> 00:26:31.364]  Why do they want to shut Infowars down?
[00:26:31.364 --> 00:26:44.698]  We told you 18 years ago they've got cameras and microphones hidden in major devices and are watching and listening to you for controlling thought content and knowing what you're doing and selling data to advertising agencies to then control the hopes and dreams of society.
[00:26:44.698 --> 00:26:45.699]  All out the open now.
[00:26:46.019 --> 00:26:46.379]  We're good
[00:27:03.985 --> 00:27:06.326]  You know, drag out in chains.
[00:27:06.326 --> 00:27:07.387]  That's not political speech.
[00:27:07.387 --> 00:27:12.070]  That's calls for military insurrection and warfare against the Republic.
[00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:33.323]  And they've got the former deputy head of the Defense Department running around in policy papers like Foreign Affairs and Foreign Policy and all these other globalist publications and going to the Pentagon and saying, you can pull it up, former deputy head of the Defense Department calling for military coup against Trump.
[00:27:34.669 --> 00:27:53.653]  That person should be arrested and then indicted the next day for organized insurrection in the country, outside of law, to foment a military mutiny and rebellion against the taxpayers, citizens of this country.
[00:27:53.653 --> 00:27:54.073]  There it is.
[00:27:54.073 --> 00:27:56.374]  Ex-Obama officials suggest military coup against Trump.
[00:27:56.374 --> 00:27:58.034]  Yeah, Breitbart and Infowars covered it.
[00:27:58.034 --> 00:27:59.115]  I mean, it's word for word.
[00:27:59.115 --> 00:28:00.815]  Going around shopping a coup.
[00:28:03.305 --> 00:28:10.971]  And then get enough of their people to start saying it, like a bunch of parrots, a bunch of cockatoos in a tree, chirping, to get the ball rolling.
[00:28:10.971 --> 00:28:12.072]  And they're really trying.
[00:28:12.072 --> 00:28:14.033]  And then the intimidation of, well, how are we going to sell it?
[00:28:14.033 --> 00:28:15.495]  We'll just say they're all Russians.
[00:28:15.495 --> 00:28:16.896]  Well, what about Breitbart and Infowars?
[00:28:16.896 --> 00:28:17.957]  They're not going to back off.
[00:28:17.957 --> 00:28:18.997]  You can't intimidate them.
[00:28:18.997 --> 00:28:20.138]  Just say they're Russians.
[00:28:20.138 --> 00:28:22.600]  Criminally investigate them.
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:23.321]  SWAT team them.
[00:28:23.321 --> 00:28:28.205]  Maybe they don't make it.
[00:28:28.205 --> 00:28:31.347]  See how that works?
[00:28:31.347 --> 00:28:32.228]  See how that unfolds?
[00:28:33.717 --> 00:28:40.559]  See how the cow ate the cabbage?
[00:28:40.559 --> 00:28:46.481]  So again, we've told you right down the line because we actually study this and I don't say this to brag.
[00:28:46.481 --> 00:28:49.963]  I say it because I've read the end of the book.
[00:28:49.963 --> 00:28:51.023]  I know where they want to take us.
[00:28:51.023 --> 00:28:52.644]  I know what their endgame is.
[00:28:52.644 --> 00:29:01.847]  They even have a project called Endgame that's a martial law takeover plan that they declassified two years after it was created and
[00:29:04.178 --> 00:29:08.699]  Three years after my film Endgame came out.
[00:29:08.699 --> 00:29:09.639]  Strangely enough.
[00:29:09.639 --> 00:29:14.260]  But the point is, is that this isn't my opinion.
[00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:16.221]  And that's why we're under such attack.
[00:29:16.221 --> 00:29:18.141]  You want somebody to challenge the globalists.
[00:29:18.141 --> 00:29:19.761]  You want somebody to fight the New World Order.
[00:29:19.761 --> 00:29:21.162]  Folks, this is it.
[00:29:21.162 --> 00:29:23.962]  This isn't about being a big show or being a big talk show host.
[00:29:23.962 --> 00:29:26.243]  This is about survival for this country.
[00:29:26.243 --> 00:29:28.443]  And it's about survival for myself and my family.
[00:29:28.443 --> 00:29:30.464]  Because I've got all my
[00:29:31.556 --> 00:29:32.936]  Marbles in on this baby.
[00:29:32.936 --> 00:29:39.339]  I'm 100% doubled down with my name, my blood, my treasure, my children.
[00:29:39.339 --> 00:29:46.001]  Everything I've got is hanging out there against the most vicious murdering criminals history's ever seen.
[00:29:46.001 --> 00:29:49.562]  Everybody's got to take that serious and get our articles out.
[00:29:49.562 --> 00:29:50.582]  This is war.
[00:29:50.582 --> 00:29:53.083]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.083 --> 00:29:55.784]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.273 --> 00:30:04.757]  WikiLeaks continues to expose the nightmarish surveillance state in which we currently live.
[00:30:04.757 --> 00:30:14.787]  As the Vault 7 leaks continue, we learn more about how the surveillance grid works, and how governments use it to spy on interesting people, or how a hacker could get access to virtually anything.
[00:30:14.787 --> 00:30:18.270]  Now WikiLeaks has released Dark Matter, the latest leak in the Vault 7 collection.
[00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:25.516]  Dark Matter claims the CIA has been bugging cell phones right out of the factory since 2008, which is right when smartphones began to take over the market.
[00:30:25.516 --> 00:30:32.361]  This comes at the hands of the Embedded Development Branch, who develop software that is ingrained into cell phones' firmware, making it there permanently.
[00:30:32.361 --> 00:30:38.987]  Combine that with all the terms and conditions we blindly agree to with every new app we download, a cell phone is a government portal to your life.
[00:30:39.167 --> 00:30:50.830]  Other such CIA operations and technology such as Dark Sea Skies, Night Skies 1.2, Sonic Screwdriver, and more will be included in the latest release, all of which seem to directly target Apple products.
[00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:55.551]  More will be breaking from Wikileaks today on Dark Matter, including a livestream of Julian Assange.
[00:30:55.551 --> 00:30:57.932]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroeder.
[00:30:57.932 --> 00:30:59.652]  Be careful with that government probe droid.
[00:30:59.972 --> 00:31:00.793]  Hey, everyone!
[00:31:00.793 --> 00:31:06.916]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[00:31:06.916 --> 00:31:08.997]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[00:31:08.997 --> 00:31:19.283]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[00:31:19.283 --> 00:31:25.266]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[00:31:25.726 --> 00:31:42.587]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives, to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino acids it needs to do its healing work,
[00:31:43.027 --> 00:31:46.469]  You need to check out Infowarsteam.com.
[00:31:46.469 --> 00:31:48.450]  Give your body the gift of good nutrition.
[00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:50.891]  Head over to Infowarsteam.com.
[00:31:50.891 --> 00:31:52.752]  Your body will be very grateful.
[00:31:52.752 --> 00:31:55.793]  On the web at Infowarsteam.com.
[00:31:55.793 --> 00:31:57.554]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[00:31:59.983 --> 00:32:01.804]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[00:32:01.804 --> 00:32:08.407]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:32:08.407 --> 00:32:11.569]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:11.569 --> 00:32:21.353]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[00:32:21.353 --> 00:32:22.214]  Caveman.
[00:32:22.214 --> 00:32:27.276]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[00:32:27.276 --> 00:32:29.377]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[00:32:29.677 --> 00:32:32.838]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:32:32.838 --> 00:32:37.980]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:46.123]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[00:32:46.123 --> 00:32:54.065]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[00:32:54.065 --> 00:32:58.707]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself and forwardslife.com today.
[00:33:00.649 --> 00:33:07.114]  This program contains language and sequences some viewers may find disturbing.
[00:33:07.114 --> 00:33:10.437]  The nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread!
[00:33:10.437 --> 00:33:14.360]  And the military apparatus of this country is about to be handed over to scum!
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:16.422]  We're beholden to scum!
[00:33:16.422 --> 00:33:17.483]  Russian scum!
[00:33:17.483 --> 00:33:18.023]  Listen.
[00:33:18.023 --> 00:33:26.790]  Please, listen.
[00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:28.392]  If you don't, if you won't,
[00:33:29.426 --> 00:33:34.710]  If you fail to understand, then the same incredible terror that's menacing me will striken you!
[00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:39.213]  The function of all life is survival.
[00:33:39.213 --> 00:33:41.215]  Sleep.
[00:33:41.215 --> 00:33:43.176]  Sleep.
[00:33:43.176 --> 00:33:44.637]  Sleep.
[00:33:44.637 --> 00:33:45.157]  Oh my God!
[00:33:45.157 --> 00:33:45.718]  Oh my God!
[00:33:45.718 --> 00:33:46.358]  Oh my God!
[00:33:46.358 --> 00:33:46.839]  Lock the door!
[00:33:46.839 --> 00:33:47.319]  Lock the door!
[00:33:47.319 --> 00:33:48.240]  They're coming!
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:49.380]  They're coming!
[00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:50.081]  Help!
[00:33:50.081 --> 00:33:50.822]  Help!
[00:33:50.822 --> 00:33:51.762]  They're coming!
[00:33:51.762 --> 00:33:52.483]  They're coming!
[00:33:52.483 --> 00:33:53.423]  Listen to me!
[00:33:53.423 --> 00:33:53.744]  Listen!
[00:33:56.471 --> 00:33:57.072]  Please!
[00:33:57.072 --> 00:33:57.572]  You're next!
[00:33:57.572 --> 00:33:58.533]  They're in danger!
[00:33:58.533 --> 00:33:59.534]  Please, listen to me!
[00:33:59.534 --> 00:34:00.715]  It's something terrible!
[00:34:00.715 --> 00:34:01.616]  Please!
[00:34:01.616 --> 00:34:02.016]  You're next!
[00:34:02.016 --> 00:34:02.797]  Here they are!
[00:34:02.797 --> 00:34:04.839]  They're already here!
[00:34:04.839 --> 00:34:05.059]  Help!
[00:34:05.059 --> 00:34:06.080]  You're next!
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:06.701]  They're coming!
[00:34:06.701 --> 00:34:08.382]  They're coming!
[00:34:08.382 --> 00:34:09.223]  Sleep.
[00:34:09.223 --> 00:34:10.364]  The seed is planted.
[00:34:10.364 --> 00:34:12.306]  Sleep.
[00:34:12.306 --> 00:34:13.247]  Sleep.
[00:34:13.247 --> 00:34:14.388]  Terror grows.
[00:34:14.388 --> 00:34:16.610]  Elizabeth, wake up!
[00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:18.191]  We'll get you when you sleep!
[00:34:18.191 --> 00:34:19.853]  Sit up!
[00:34:19.853 --> 00:34:22.015]  Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
[00:34:23.468 --> 00:34:25.690]  All of a sudden, they're growing like parasites.
[00:34:25.690 --> 00:34:27.131]  Is it contagious?
[00:34:27.131 --> 00:34:27.871]  Mom!
[00:34:27.871 --> 00:34:29.072]  Brianna, help me!
[00:34:29.072 --> 00:34:30.113]  It looked right at me.
[00:34:30.113 --> 00:34:31.093]  You need to get out!
[00:34:31.093 --> 00:34:32.915]  You're looking at it as if it was human.
[00:34:32.915 --> 00:34:35.517]  I'm not human.
[00:34:35.517 --> 00:34:38.619]  Now, the classic fear begins to grow.
[00:34:38.619 --> 00:34:40.420]  We're being cornered!
[00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:44.243]  In a modern masterpiece of science fiction.
[00:34:44.243 --> 00:34:47.044]  They're barricading the street.
[00:34:47.044 --> 00:34:49.186]  Invasion of the body statues.
[00:35:10.811 --> 00:35:15.815]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:35:15.815 --> 00:35:28.823]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:35:28.823 --> 00:35:38.170]  I tend to get excited just because I look at news at night in the morning and I get up here at the office and literally look at hundreds of stories and it's just crazy.
[00:35:39.724 --> 00:35:46.647]  That there's been another Islamic attack with a truck and people stabbed.
[00:35:46.647 --> 00:35:58.152]  And then just so many videos, I can't even play them all, of just mobs of hateful, arrogant, crazy-looking men going, screw you, Britain!
[00:35:58.152 --> 00:35:59.272]  Down with the UK!
[00:35:59.272 --> 00:36:00.333]  We're gonna kill you!
[00:36:00.333 --> 00:36:01.993]  We're gonna kill your families!
[00:36:01.993 --> 00:36:06.295]  We're gonna kill the Queen of England!
[00:36:06.295 --> 00:36:08.036]  And then it's only on the internet
[00:36:09.130 --> 00:36:12.953]  Every once in a while, Fox News might show 10 seconds of it.
[00:36:12.953 --> 00:36:17.036]  And it's like, what in the hell?
[00:36:17.036 --> 00:36:32.269]  And it's like men, on the welfare system in Europe, wearing their Islamic garb like they're in the middle of the desert, just totally arrogant, screaming, we're going to kill you.
[00:36:32.269 --> 00:36:37.153]  And then just like with any big Islamic attack, on Al Jazeera's official
[00:36:38.306 --> 00:36:49.251]  Feed, on Facebook, thousands of emojis, celebrating it, screenshot in live time.
[00:36:49.251 --> 00:36:57.295]  For every frowny face, there are like 10 smiley faces, and it went on for hours.
[00:36:57.295 --> 00:37:01.837]  And for every thumbs down, there's not even one thumbs down on that page.
[00:37:01.837 --> 00:37:04.038]  Look at that.
[00:37:04.038 --> 00:37:05.659]  Not one thumbs down.
[00:37:05.659 --> 00:37:07.260]  Thumbs up, baby.
[00:37:11.903 --> 00:37:13.884]  I remember 9-11.
[00:37:13.884 --> 00:37:21.928]  I remember Palestinians celebrating in Palestine on the Nish.
[00:37:21.928 --> 00:37:23.149]  Does that mean I wanted those wars?
[00:37:23.149 --> 00:37:24.390]  Does that mean I hate all Muslims?
[00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:24.470]  No.
[00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:29.252]  Does that mean the globalists are good?
[00:37:29.252 --> 00:37:29.652]  Absolutely not.
[00:37:29.652 --> 00:37:32.434]  They're the ones that are allied with the most radical forms of Islam.
[00:37:36.522 --> 00:37:47.225]  So, on the online feed of Al Jazeera, just celebration time, and then Trump talked about this phenomenon that's well documented during the campaign, and they said he was crazy.
[00:37:47.225 --> 00:37:58.369]  And then InfoWars linked to a New York Post, and also, what was it, a BBC article from years before, and Trump tweeted it, and they went crazy and said his source is Alex Jones.
[00:37:58.369 --> 00:38:00.910]  No, not that I'm a bad source.
[00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:05.491]  We just had a new article and boiled down how Trump was right, and how it really was in the newspaper.
[00:38:08.851 --> 00:38:11.692]  That's not real journalism to say it was from Alex, just made up.
[00:38:11.692 --> 00:38:20.594]  No, I had links to a New York and British newspaper or publication showing that Trump was right.
[00:38:20.594 --> 00:38:21.954]  That's what we do.
[00:38:21.954 --> 00:38:35.578]  We go show you literally hundreds of articles the last month during this controversy where they're saying that there was no spying on the Trumps or their transition team, when it was all over the front pages of newspapers everywhere.
[00:38:37.458 --> 00:38:46.084]  And then the House Intelligence Committee head comes out and says, yes, I've been brought the info.
[00:38:46.084 --> 00:38:53.750]  See, the way the intelligence agencies work, they go, sir, you're the highest elected person in the House over intelligence, but you don't need to come actually see it.
[00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:58.673]  Only 20 people at the NSA can see this, sir.
[00:38:58.673 --> 00:39:00.815]  And then Congress starts going, wait a minute, we have the oversight.
[00:39:02.039 --> 00:39:07.202]  They're like, sir, you passed the laws, you passed the regulations, but those actually say there'll be oversight.
[00:39:07.202 --> 00:39:14.287]  Then you're gonna learn it's 20 people at the NSA that run hunt groups of tens of thousands under them.
[00:39:14.287 --> 00:39:18.350]  Ladies and gentlemen, let me give you a little news flash.
[00:39:18.350 --> 00:39:21.712]  I don't like how deep I am into this at a certain level, okay?
[00:39:21.712 --> 00:39:25.394]  I'm not on a power trip about it, but let me just tell you something.
[00:39:25.394 --> 00:39:28.436]  I've seen stuff hardly anybody else has seen.
[00:39:28.436 --> 00:39:30.738]  I'm not just here on air talking about this stuff.
[00:39:33.752 --> 00:39:39.993]  They've got displays and systems that are AI run where the computer itself, you just target the person.
[00:39:39.993 --> 00:39:46.394]  There's a whole map of everything they do, every device they've got, and that machine tries to hammer in and break into everything you've got.
[00:39:46.394 --> 00:39:48.134]  It's normally already broken in.
[00:39:48.134 --> 00:39:56.456]  And then they've got microscopic capacitors in the chips for at least six years that are microscopic microphones.
[00:39:56.456 --> 00:39:59.676]  And that's been in the news.
[00:39:59.676 --> 00:40:02.537]  That data transferred over cable
[00:40:03.590 --> 00:40:10.094]  And over wireless and over power lines is just scooping it all up.
[00:40:10.094 --> 00:40:12.336]  And that's stuff I knew about 15 years ago.
[00:40:12.336 --> 00:40:22.663]  By the way, the guy that helped expose a lot of it first, Dr. Nick Baggage, of course, his brother, outgoing senator, father, famous congressperson, congressman, he's going to be in studio with us.
[00:40:22.663 --> 00:40:25.024]  He's down here visiting from Alaska.
[00:40:25.024 --> 00:40:26.986]  And he goes off the patents and the admissions.
[00:40:28.206 --> 00:40:30.147]  So we're gonna talk about how far.
[00:40:30.147 --> 00:40:35.891]  Everything we told you about 18, 19 years ago, now is out in the open.
[00:40:35.891 --> 00:40:40.254]  Didn't come true, it was already true, just now it's admitted.
[00:40:40.254 --> 00:40:42.776]  We're gonna tell you the rest of the story.
[00:40:42.776 --> 00:40:44.077]  And see, that's what's frustrating.
[00:40:44.077 --> 00:40:54.524]  When I tell you that most major chip makers, under government directives, have microscopic receivers, transmitters in them.
[00:40:54.524 --> 00:40:56.666]  I'm not an engineer, I've just read all the schematics, the documents.
[00:40:59.053 --> 00:41:05.216]  Where they can energize chips from a distance, even if your computer's not plugged in, and then have those transmit out.
[00:41:05.216 --> 00:41:08.498]  And you go, well, where do they get picked up?
[00:41:08.498 --> 00:41:22.766]  By the Apple device, by the Google device, your little friend you have in the house, like Alexa, that, you know, you ask questions of, and you order things from, and you, it's there, always on, and it's picking everything up.
[00:41:24.653 --> 00:41:27.314]  And the smart meter on the side of your house, same deal.
[00:41:27.314 --> 00:41:30.536]  Google has cars that drive around and steal your data.
[00:41:30.536 --> 00:41:35.798]  They don't just videotape your house or have drones or satellites partnered with NASA.
[00:41:39.261 --> 00:41:42.002]  They're jacked into everything, folks.
[00:41:42.002 --> 00:41:45.084]  It's 50 years beyond what they're even admitting now.
[00:41:45.084 --> 00:41:46.585]  And that's why they're so arrogant.
[00:41:46.585 --> 00:41:47.285]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:41:47.285 --> 00:41:55.610]  If 7.5 billion people decide to stop going along with all this, we can have good, clean technology that empowers us and isn't used to suppress and control us.
[00:41:55.610 --> 00:41:59.512]  But the elites decided to do this, and they've built the architecture in.
[00:41:59.512 --> 00:42:02.674]  Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Twitter.
[00:42:02.674 --> 00:42:06.836]  They're all working with China to develop censorship tools here in Europe and the United States.
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:13.563]  So they can prove themselves demonstrating it here to move into China.
[00:42:13.563 --> 00:42:18.146]  And Microsoft just got approved to move back into China, countrywide.
[00:42:18.146 --> 00:42:30.253]  In fact, they've been approved for a while, but to be the official operating system of the Communist Chinese system, because Bill Gates, obviously, is with the Rockefeller Foundation and helped set up this whole modern system we're under, but there it is.
[00:42:30.253 --> 00:42:32.134]  That's now been officially adopted.
[00:42:32.134 --> 00:42:37.337]  Communist Chinese have a mysterious new version of Windows 10 created for them.
[00:42:39.525 --> 00:42:40.765]  Isn't that just cute?
[00:42:40.765 --> 00:42:42.746]  London Independent today.
[00:42:42.746 --> 00:42:46.467]  So see, this is what I'm getting at for you.
[00:42:46.467 --> 00:42:54.908]  They think you're so dumb that they have a jihadi run over a bunch of people and stab a bunch of people and our news will barely even say it's Islamic.
[00:42:54.908 --> 00:42:58.049]  And in England, they're going around saying it's hate, don't do it.
[00:42:58.049 --> 00:43:01.790]  And I was watching footage this morning online of just thousands of Muslim men
[00:43:04.205 --> 00:43:14.531]  Yesterday and today, out celebrating, and with so much hate in their eyes and their mouths open and their teeth showing, like a murderous horde of zombies.
[00:43:14.531 --> 00:43:19.193]  And I'm supposed to go, oh I love you, come on in, oh I don't want to be mean, sure, kill me!
[00:43:19.193 --> 00:43:32.621]  You wonder if we're going under tyranny when every intelligence agency run
[00:43:33.971 --> 00:43:35.573]  Platform?
[00:43:35.573 --> 00:43:37.255]  In the United States?
[00:43:37.255 --> 00:43:38.657]  Google was created by the CIA.
[00:43:38.657 --> 00:43:40.179]  That's public.
[00:43:40.179 --> 00:43:40.719]  Facebook.
[00:43:40.719 --> 00:43:41.140]  All of it.
[00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:42.021]  That's not even debated.
[00:43:42.021 --> 00:43:44.124]  Look it up.
[00:43:44.124 --> 00:43:47.968]  They're all working to figure out how to enslave you.
[00:43:47.968 --> 00:43:50.371]  Does that mean 95% of people in the agencies like it?
[00:43:50.371 --> 00:43:50.812]  No, they don't.
[00:43:52.244 --> 00:44:04.901]  That's what I'm trying to get rid of all the people that are moral and good and bring in the Generation Millennial who on average is the most servile, brainwashed, evil little creatures you can imagine.
[00:44:04.901 --> 00:44:07.765]  Strangely enough, Generation Z is the opposite.
[00:44:07.765 --> 00:44:08.386]  So it's weird how
[00:44:10.646 --> 00:44:15.387]  Culturally, things manifest like that, but they've really caught this generation.
[00:44:15.387 --> 00:44:17.048]  The adults didn't know what was going on.
[00:44:17.048 --> 00:44:19.848]  They got them with the TV and the computers, and they're gone.
[00:44:19.848 --> 00:44:23.869]  And if you're a millennial, some of the best people are millennials.
[00:44:23.869 --> 00:44:31.791]  Just statistically, the numbers are there.
[00:44:31.791 --> 00:44:37.792]  And they think being dishonorable is cool, or just being delusional.
[00:44:37.792 --> 00:44:39.673]  They think caring is stupid.
[00:44:40.506 --> 00:44:42.888]  They think it's... they're like artificial sociopaths.
[00:44:42.888 --> 00:44:48.633]  They're not complete sociopaths, but they have sociopathic characteristics.
[00:44:48.633 --> 00:44:50.995]  And they're just... people are so baby-like.
[00:44:50.995 --> 00:44:56.659]  They're entitled.
[00:44:56.659 --> 00:44:57.900]  They don't have real empathy.
[00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:05.066]  They have virtue-signaling empathy.
[00:45:05.066 --> 00:45:07.909]  Their language is small.
[00:45:07.909 --> 00:45:09.370]  They're restricted.
[00:45:10.845 --> 00:45:14.751]  They're like, you know, kids trying to act cool in junior high.
[00:45:14.751 --> 00:45:16.894]  And, you know, getting little clicks.
[00:45:16.894 --> 00:45:24.465]  I mean, just imagine that times ten, and that's the elitist system they're building and the type of minions they want to be one of the last generations.
[00:45:25.646 --> 00:45:28.668]  Before they really release the bioweapons and wipe almost everybody out.
[00:45:28.668 --> 00:45:40.617]  They're just getting the containment grids up, getting us in cities, getting the police forces in place, getting the robots in place, and getting us totally domesticated before they hammer down and then BOOM!
[00:45:40.617 --> 00:45:41.598]  The agreements have been made.
[00:45:41.598 --> 00:45:50.164]  They're going to wipe out 90% of the Chinese, 90% of the folks in Africa, Latin America, and the West is going to have big death too.
[00:45:50.164 --> 00:45:51.746]  But these are race specific.
[00:45:51.746 --> 00:45:53.187]  And China's agreed to all this, by the way.
[00:45:53.945 --> 00:46:03.713]  And then they're going to start releasing the bioweapons that kill the Ice Age mutants.
[00:46:03.713 --> 00:46:05.074]  That's white people.
[00:46:05.074 --> 00:46:06.335]  People say, oh yeah, you admit you're a mutant.
[00:46:06.335 --> 00:46:07.536]  That's what the black nationalists say.
[00:46:07.536 --> 00:46:08.357]  Yeah, so are you.
[00:46:08.357 --> 00:46:09.138]  Everybody mutates.
[00:46:09.138 --> 00:46:09.898]  Everybody's different.
[00:46:09.898 --> 00:46:12.621]  So you have all the different groups and variations and the rest of it.
[00:46:12.621 --> 00:46:14.022]  But that's what's going on.
[00:46:14.022 --> 00:46:19.126]  The globalists are in total competition with everybody.
[00:46:19.126 --> 00:46:20.127]  They hate their own families.
[00:46:22.805 --> 00:46:24.465]  You've got to read their writings.
[00:46:24.465 --> 00:46:28.727]  I want to get rid of my family, they say, because I want to transcend them and merge the machines.
[00:46:28.727 --> 00:46:31.167]  These people are the most selfish folks you can imagine.
[00:46:31.167 --> 00:46:33.608]  But let me get back to the news here.
[00:46:33.608 --> 00:46:37.169]  On Infowars.com, proof Muslims celebrated terror attack in London.
[00:46:37.169 --> 00:46:37.549]  Guess what?
[00:46:37.549 --> 00:46:41.030]  Facebook's not letting us share that last time I checked.
[00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:46.192]  Arabic TV viewers reacted with smiley emoticons.
[00:46:46.192 --> 00:46:47.932]  Thumbs up!
[00:46:47.932 --> 00:46:49.893]  And their comments were, they love it.
[00:46:49.893 --> 00:46:51.133]  Lawmaker claims Parliament
[00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:52.990]  Suspects for religion?
[00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:53.431]  Irrelevant.
[00:46:53.431 --> 00:46:57.253]  Yeah, he just did it for ISIS on the one-year anniversary of the Brussels-Belgium attack.
[00:46:57.253 --> 00:46:58.834]  There's nothing to see here.
[00:46:58.834 --> 00:47:02.596]  And Santa Claus has nothing to do with modern Christmas.
[00:47:02.596 --> 00:47:05.358]  And Jesus has nothing to do with Christianity.
[00:47:05.358 --> 00:47:12.022]  And Moses has nothing to do with Judaism.
[00:47:12.022 --> 00:47:15.064]  London terrorists incident happened on the first anniversary of the Brussels bombing.
[00:47:15.064 --> 00:47:15.464]  Check it out.
[00:47:15.464 --> 00:47:16.665]  Infowars.com.
[00:47:16.665 --> 00:47:21.648]  Lone Wolf, UK police arrest eight suspects tied to London jihadist in Don Raids.
[00:47:23.453 --> 00:47:25.554]  I just love how most of these guys don't even work.
[00:47:25.554 --> 00:47:32.578]  They sit there on welfare, and then they just bitch and gripe and, you know, just try to intimidate everybody into Islam.
[00:47:32.578 --> 00:47:33.398]  That's the older men.
[00:47:33.398 --> 00:47:45.244]  The younger men wear, you know, track suits and go out and, you know, go after all the cuckold women.
[00:47:45.244 --> 00:47:51.787]  And, like, Western men have been taught to be so wimpy, and then women think it's, like, really cool, so it's like, get over here!
[00:47:51.787 --> 00:47:52.448]  Do what I say!
[00:47:54.619 --> 00:47:55.339]  Yes.
[00:47:55.339 --> 00:48:04.122]  So all the pretty women are like, literally, large numbers are converting to Islam now, because it's like, I like wearing a hood over my head, but Western culture sucks!
[00:48:04.122 --> 00:48:15.507]  Al Jazeera viewers reacted to London terror with joy, but Turkish dictator Erdogan threatened Europe on the same day London attacked by terrorists.
[00:48:15.507 --> 00:48:16.027]  That's right, he said...
[00:48:17.469 --> 00:48:22.932]  Turkish dictator Erdogan threatened Europe on the same day London was attacked by terrorist scum.
[00:48:22.932 --> 00:48:31.056]  He said, and his minister said it on Monday, we're launching a jihad and a holy war in Europe and England because
[00:48:32.403 --> 00:48:36.586]  You're not letting us form political Islamic affiliates inside your country in Sharia law.
[00:48:36.586 --> 00:48:38.448]  See, they got a certain number.
[00:48:38.448 --> 00:48:40.069]  France is what, 15% Muslim?
[00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:41.370]  Germany's about 10?
[00:48:41.370 --> 00:48:46.555]  As soon as you hit that number, the smiley faces go off, and the jihad kicks in.
[00:48:46.555 --> 00:48:47.796]  And you know what?
[00:48:47.796 --> 00:48:49.117]  They think we're gonna roll over.
[00:48:53.348 --> 00:48:55.830]  Vehicles becoming favored terrorist attack weapon.
[00:48:55.830 --> 00:49:04.775]  And remember, the globalists, the UN, our own government, bi-partisans, the ones opening the border, bringing it in, letting the UN Refugee Agency decide who comes in.
[00:49:04.775 --> 00:49:08.738]  Not our Border Patrol, not our Customs and Border Enforcement, but the UN.
[00:49:08.738 --> 00:49:13.040]  And Trump's trying to stop where the UN dictates who comes in.
[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:19.925]  He's trying to build a wall as a make-work project and as a symbol that we're a country.
[00:49:19.925 --> 00:49:20.325]  That's all.
[00:49:21.274 --> 00:49:24.195]  Like Mexico's got a fence and a wall on its southern border.
[00:49:24.195 --> 00:49:24.895]  Right across it.
[00:49:24.895 --> 00:49:31.338]  Contiguous.
[00:49:31.338 --> 00:49:33.179]  We have Dr. Begich in here in the next hour.
[00:49:33.179 --> 00:49:36.260]  I'm going to hit some really important news.
[00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:37.300]  I've got to get to these Nunez clips.
[00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:38.921]  I've got to get to the other clips.
[00:49:38.921 --> 00:49:42.342]  I've got... He's been obviously with intelligence agencies high up.
[00:49:42.342 --> 00:49:49.245]  I've got Pchenik coming on for about 15 minutes to give us his take on this war that's going on.
[00:49:49.245 --> 00:49:49.985]  We know what's happening.
[00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:57.326]  But then I'm going to spend the rest of the time getting all the clips and some phone calls today.
[00:49:57.326 --> 00:50:01.850]  But just to recap, Michael Moore is calling on Dems to declare a national emergency.
[00:50:01.850 --> 00:50:03.451]  They're all calling for martial law.
[00:50:03.451 --> 00:50:07.595]  They're all over the place saying it's insane that Trump was spied on even though it's admitted.
[00:50:07.595 --> 00:50:14.281]  The FEC is calling for censoring conservative and libertarian media like Drudge Report by name.
[00:50:14.281 --> 00:50:14.942]  It's already happening.
[00:50:17.423 --> 00:50:37.268]  And the truth is, folks, we're not going to have a show, we're not going to exist if people don't realize this is happening by incremental, successful approximation, and if you don't defeat them in their latest attempts to censor by making InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and our articles and our videos even more popular, and Drudge Report even more powerful.
[00:50:37.268 --> 00:50:42.810]  I'm not going to stand for Drudge to be the number two biggest website in the world after MSM, and the biggest news site, hands down.
[00:50:42.810 --> 00:50:44.430]  It needs to be number one.
[00:50:48.484 --> 00:50:54.816]  Infowars, our videos, don't need to be number one in the political, they need to be number one, period.
[00:50:54.816 --> 00:50:58.923]  And they don't even let our subscribers videotape this, screenshot it, you know, show it.
[00:51:00.077 --> 00:51:01.218]  We're good to go.
[00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:25.841]  We have our own platforms.
[00:51:25.841 --> 00:51:26.702]  We stream our own videos.
[00:51:26.702 --> 00:51:27.583]  We post our own videos.
[00:51:27.583 --> 00:51:29.504]  We pay our own bandwidth.
[00:51:29.504 --> 00:51:30.365]  It's very expensive.
[00:51:30.365 --> 00:51:30.866]  We're doing it.
[00:51:30.866 --> 00:51:32.727]  We have our own outpost.
[00:51:32.727 --> 00:51:34.109]  But they're coming after our funding.
[00:51:37.421 --> 00:51:40.404]  Folks, over the years I've never had this many calls for support and help.
[00:51:40.404 --> 00:51:43.846]  And it's because I realize it's going to intensify and it's going to get stronger.
[00:51:43.846 --> 00:51:48.771]  And I've got to grow in their face and take on everything they're doing behind the scenes.
[00:51:48.771 --> 00:51:51.173]  And it's legendary.
[00:51:51.173 --> 00:51:52.714]  Last night I was so proud.
[00:51:52.714 --> 00:51:58.279]  I went from just being willing to do this to... It was a new level of confidence.
[00:51:58.279 --> 00:52:03.163]  I mean, I feel it now, but last night I could feel God's hand on me so strong.
[00:52:03.163 --> 00:52:04.364]  I mean, the comfort of it.
[00:52:06.598 --> 00:52:07.439]  The Comforter.
[00:52:07.439 --> 00:52:08.460]  And it was beyond that.
[00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:18.330]  It was being so grounded and so dialed in.
[00:52:18.330 --> 00:52:20.492]  It was just, it's just, it's incredible.
[00:52:20.492 --> 00:52:21.293]  I'm like, wow.
[00:52:21.293 --> 00:52:28.139]  I mean, what is it like as you go through these phases of fighting evil and as you get older and as you pass each test, what is it like?
[00:52:28.139 --> 00:52:29.100]  What happens down the road?
[00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:30.402]  It's, it's, it's unbelievable.
[00:52:31.616 --> 00:52:34.599]  That's how I understand what they're going to do before they even do.
[00:52:34.599 --> 00:52:41.986]  That's how we break down their operations with such precision is because I've totally immersed myself in this.
[00:52:41.986 --> 00:52:43.427]  And it's beyond that.
[00:52:43.427 --> 00:52:48.392]  It's a spirit of understanding, discernment.
[00:52:48.392 --> 00:52:49.553]  The problem is I can't turn it off.
[00:52:49.553 --> 00:52:52.276]  It's always just and it's so much.
[00:52:52.276 --> 00:52:52.877]  How do I even?
[00:52:54.929 --> 00:52:58.851]  Cover it, because I'm not this frustrated, angry person in person most of the time.
[00:52:58.851 --> 00:53:06.035]  It's just coming in contact with the most insane... I mean, look at Kim Jong Un.
[00:53:06.035 --> 00:53:15.159]  A horrible, demonic, spoiled nobody that couldn't even have a job pumping gas that no one would talk to because he's such a conceited, evil little rat.
[00:53:15.159 --> 00:53:20.042]  And that's who the devil put in power over the tens of millions of slaves.
[00:53:20.042 --> 00:53:24.464]  And their whole religion is to degrading humans and making them worship scum.
[00:53:26.564 --> 00:53:31.106]  Kim Jong-un is Satan.
[00:53:31.106 --> 00:53:37.049]  I mean, look at the weakness, look at the selfishness, look at the patheticness, look at the laughing at everyone.
[00:53:37.049 --> 00:53:40.731]  Just, ah ha ha ha, the power trip, the sickening.
[00:53:40.731 --> 00:53:44.993]  When I die, I want to be the polar opposite of that guy.
[00:53:44.993 --> 00:53:51.016]  Hell would be being locked in a cell with a bunch of Kim Jong-uns.
[00:53:51.016 --> 00:53:53.878]  And David Rockefeller, you know, I prayed to God last week that you'd pray.
[00:53:55.199 --> 00:54:02.341]  That people that are enemies of this Republic, like Media Matters, we name Media Matters, we gotta find a clip, we name it.
[00:54:02.341 --> 00:54:21.627]  I'm guessing people like David Rockefeller, people like Ted Turner, people like Bill Gates, people like, this is an example that needs to be made, people like Bow Wow, that if it's God's will, they be really shown the real power in this universe.
[00:54:22.659 --> 00:54:28.584]  Probably just a coincidence that David Brock had a big heart attack yesterday, and David Rockefeller was old, so.
[00:54:28.584 --> 00:54:35.128]  The point is, is that they're all going to die, they're all going to face, they're all going to face judgment.
[00:54:35.128 --> 00:54:40.513]  It's good just to remind them of that, but I tell you, I do pray.
[00:54:40.513 --> 00:54:51.421]  Not in a hateful way, not in a worldly way, but they're hurting innocent people, and I ask God, God, not people, not you, don't do anything violent against them, I ask God to just get them right.
[00:54:52.196 --> 00:54:54.197]  However God does that.
[00:54:54.197 --> 00:54:55.758]  But I have to speak that.
[00:54:55.758 --> 00:54:56.558]  You have to speak it too.
[00:54:56.558 --> 00:54:58.399]  You know what happens when you do that?
[00:54:58.399 --> 00:55:07.663]  You set your will metaphysically in line and say, I'm ready to openly speak this in the open against the enemy, God.
[00:55:07.663 --> 00:55:10.784]  And I'm asking you to take us the rest of the way.
[00:55:10.784 --> 00:55:17.067]  I'm asking you to intervene.
[00:55:19.679 --> 00:55:20.399]  As an example.
[00:55:20.399 --> 00:55:25.842]  And then if we don't see that example and don't hit our knees and our faces before you, we deserve whatever else comes.
[00:55:25.842 --> 00:55:26.922]  We don't humble ourselves.
[00:55:26.922 --> 00:55:34.786]  But I'm asking God to show these heathen the real power of fire raining down from heaven and consuming them.
[00:55:44.741 --> 00:55:52.245]  They want us destroyed, they want us dead, they laugh at our God because they know the power.
[00:55:52.245 --> 00:55:58.049]  Ask for the providence like George Washington did in 1776 when he accepted his commission.
[00:55:58.049 --> 00:56:04.613]  Take your commission in the fight against the globalists and support the Infowars and those, I mean, who's there?
[00:56:04.613 --> 00:56:10.116]  There's Infowars is definitely, Trump's under the most attack, then Infowars, then Drudge, then Reitbart.
[00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:12.480]  You want people to fight?
[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:16.042]  All I'm saying is, how this ends is how this ends.
[00:56:16.042 --> 00:56:20.323]  I just want you to have an opportunity to know, this is history happening right now.
[00:56:20.323 --> 00:56:21.984]  And look how we fund ourselves.
[00:56:21.984 --> 00:56:29.666]  With high-quality, organic, made in America, fluoride-free toothpaste, with iodine, colloidal silver, peppermint, tea tree oil.
[00:56:29.666 --> 00:56:32.067]  This is so popular that
[00:56:33.527 --> 00:56:35.109]  We keep selling out of it.
[00:56:35.109 --> 00:56:36.391]  And I'm about to have to scale up.
[00:56:36.391 --> 00:56:39.554]  It's a gamble to produce an even larger amount.
[00:56:39.554 --> 00:56:42.258]  We'd probably lower the price then, because as you make more, you can lower the price.
[00:56:42.258 --> 00:56:43.419]  But it's very affordable.
[00:56:43.419 --> 00:56:44.921]  You get it as low as $8.
[00:56:44.921 --> 00:56:46.383]  You get two tubes of it.
[00:56:46.383 --> 00:56:48.505]  It's at Infowarslife.com.
[00:56:48.505 --> 00:56:50.308]  And at the current sales rate, it'll sell out by next week.
[00:56:51.462 --> 00:56:55.566]  But then the children's bubblegum that's been held back for a while will be here.
[00:56:55.566 --> 00:56:59.149]  It just doesn't have the tea tree and as much peppermint because it is strong.
[00:56:59.149 --> 00:57:00.470]  It's concentrated.
[00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:03.633]  It's got hundreds of reviews on third-party review sites.
[00:57:03.633 --> 00:57:04.895]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:10.013 --> 00:57:10.374]  888-253-3139.
[00:57:10.374 --> 00:57:13.236]  Sign up for AutoShip.
[00:57:13.236 --> 00:57:14.877]  This is the kind of thing you need to keep getting.
[00:57:14.877 --> 00:57:20.942]  Sign up for AutoShip as a pledge, as a tie to the InfoWar, so that you don't have to keep thinking about it and doing it each time.
[00:57:20.942 --> 00:57:21.863]  I'm the same way.
[00:57:21.863 --> 00:57:23.865]  I had some toothpaste and ran out of it, and more wasn't here.
[00:57:23.865 --> 00:57:28.148]  I was like, oh, I should sign up for AutoShip, so I get it at my house.
[00:57:28.148 --> 00:57:29.169]  I mean, you see what I mean?
[00:57:29.169 --> 00:57:34.194]  You get it, you forget anything like Supermel Vitality or X2 or BrainForce.
[00:57:34.194 --> 00:57:36.756]  That way you fund the InfoWar, you get great products like Caveman.
[00:57:39.795 --> 00:57:40.916]  Bone broth and turmeric.
[00:57:40.916 --> 00:57:41.657]  It's got a lot more.
[00:57:41.657 --> 00:57:42.717]  What a game changer.
[00:57:42.717 --> 00:57:56.028]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139 because I know, in fact, I know in my gut we're going to get the support to not just continue and on under the onslaught, but go to the next level.
[00:57:59.042 --> 00:58:11.648]  Because for what you see publicly, saying I'm under criminal investigation for being a Russian asset, and you know, all the other craziness, for anything you see on the surface, there's 95% more under the water.
[00:58:11.648 --> 00:58:18.871]  Sometime I might tell people all about it.
[00:58:18.871 --> 00:58:20.612]  Let's just say we're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:58:22.947 --> 00:58:27.230]  Again, Nunes came out and said of course Trump was being surveilled.
[00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:28.451]  Of course he was.
[00:58:28.451 --> 00:58:30.193]  Again, the hoax is collapsing.
[00:58:30.193 --> 00:58:31.294]  What a beautiful thing.
[00:58:31.294 --> 00:58:34.936]  And the hoax will collapse that this isn't an Islamic attack, it just happened in England.
[00:58:34.936 --> 00:58:38.959]  I mean, again, we've got to call them on their bluff, on their attempt at peer pressure.
[00:58:38.959 --> 00:58:41.742]  They think you're nothing but dumb followers.
[00:58:41.742 --> 00:58:42.802]  They're not.
[00:58:42.802 --> 00:58:44.083]  You're smart.
[00:58:44.083 --> 00:58:44.724]  We're going to win.
[00:58:44.724 --> 00:58:46.505]  Dr. Nick Begich coming up.
[00:58:46.505 --> 00:58:46.906]  Stay with us.
[00:58:50.057 --> 00:58:56.601]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:58:56.601 --> 00:58:59.822]  Dr. Grimm, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:58:59.822 --> 00:59:05.405]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:59:05.405 --> 00:59:11.528]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:59:11.528 --> 00:59:14.810]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:59:14.810 --> 00:59:16.251]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[00:59:16.451 --> 00:59:20.773]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:59:20.773 --> 00:59:23.714]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:59:23.714 --> 00:59:25.375]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:59:25.375 --> 00:59:28.816]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:59:28.816 --> 00:59:31.417]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:59:31.417 --> 00:59:32.478]  It's in powder form.
[00:59:32.478 --> 00:59:35.339]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[00:59:35.339 --> 00:59:36.059]  I take this.
[00:59:36.059 --> 00:59:37.880]  This is the product that I take.
[00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:39.861]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[00:59:40.661 --> 00:59:41.461]  We fight the Globals!
[00:59:41.461 --> 00:59:42.622]  We fight the New World Order!
[00:59:42.622 --> 00:59:46.963]  Secure your DNA Force today at InfoWarsLive.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:59:46.963 --> 00:59:48.764]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:14.239 --> 01:00:19.121]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:00:19.121 --> 01:00:23.984]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:23.984 --> 01:00:29.286]  I got a bunch of folks run over by a car, stabbed right in front of Big Ben in Parliament.
[01:00:29.286 --> 01:00:30.327]  Been on that bridge many times.
[01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:46.979]  And you got Al Jazeera viewers celebrating online, almost 100% thumbs up, smiley faces, and in the comments celebrating in Arabic on the one-year anniversary of the Brussels-Belgium attack that of course had nothing to do with Islam either.
[01:00:46.979 --> 01:00:52.902]  Muslims in London say Queen Elizabeth has to convert to Islam or leave the country.
[01:00:52.902 --> 01:00:57.045]  And then Tommy Robinson rips into laughing leftists at London terror site.
[01:00:57.045 --> 01:00:58.426]  Oh, they're celebrating it too, because see,
[01:01:00.319 --> 01:01:01.519]  They get off on all of it.
[01:01:01.519 --> 01:01:02.660]  It's funny to them.
[01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:08.702]  They're paid to go out and laugh at survival instinct.
[01:01:08.702 --> 01:01:14.324]  They don't let you march against radical Islam in England.
[01:01:14.324 --> 01:01:18.405]  We've had Mr. Robinson on before, but here are Muslims in London saying Queen Elizabeth has a convert.
[01:01:19.281 --> 01:01:20.801]  To Islam or leave the country.
[01:01:20.801 --> 01:01:23.962]  Boy, isn't that the religion of peace and equality?
[01:01:23.962 --> 01:01:26.963]  And thank God they're having all these women's marches.
[01:01:26.963 --> 01:01:30.464]  Oh, the leader of the major women's marches came out and called for getting rid of Israel.
[01:01:30.464 --> 01:01:44.169]  Whether you love Israel or not, the point is this is Islamic women who aren't even allowed to leave the house unless they're on some errand to get the general population to go along with their downfall.
[01:01:44.169 --> 01:01:47.830]  Leading a bunch of West-hating, man-hating, brainwashed women.
[01:01:48.544 --> 01:01:53.708]  We're trying to blow up their prosperity like suicide bombers.
[01:01:53.708 --> 01:01:54.949]  So here's the Muslims in London.
[01:01:54.949 --> 01:01:55.809]  This is CNN.
[01:01:55.809 --> 01:02:00.593]  It's actually crazy that they even reported on it.
[01:02:00.593 --> 01:02:07.598]  It's basically showing how we will transform Buckingham Palace into a local mosque for the Muslims.
[01:02:07.598 --> 01:02:09.159]  And what happens to the Queen?
[01:02:09.159 --> 01:02:10.220]  Well, the Queen, she has a choice.
[01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:11.861]  She can either become Muslim or she can leave the country.
[01:02:14.605 --> 01:02:16.888]  And I saw a bunch of other videos this morning where they're just like, rah!
[01:02:16.888 --> 01:02:17.970]  Get out of England!
[01:02:17.970 --> 01:02:19.832]  You know, England is ours!
[01:02:19.832 --> 01:02:20.673]  Screw the UK!
[01:02:20.673 --> 01:02:22.776]  I don't think we can pull that up.
[01:02:22.776 --> 01:02:24.198]  Here's another one.
[01:02:24.198 --> 01:02:27.282]  Tommy Robinson, these people are waging war on us.
[01:02:27.282 --> 01:02:29.365]  And then we've got the leftists making jokes about it.
[01:02:29.365 --> 01:02:29.666]  Here it is.
[01:02:30.794 --> 01:02:31.615]  I'm on the reality.
[01:02:31.615 --> 01:02:32.575]  This is the reality.
[01:02:32.575 --> 01:02:34.356]  The reality is this is a war.
[01:02:34.356 --> 01:02:36.778]  These people are waging war on us for time.
[01:02:36.778 --> 01:02:37.899]  This has gone on for 1,400 years.
[01:02:37.899 --> 01:02:39.320]  This is nothing new.
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:44.503]  And the whole time while this goes on, police leaders or political leaders want to invite more!
[01:02:44.503 --> 01:02:48.706]  They want to invite more!
[01:02:48.706 --> 01:02:55.210]  But meanwhile, members of Parliament, the articles are on Infowars.com, are claiming that the suspect's religion is irrelevant.
[01:02:56.578 --> 01:03:01.121]  That's right, you're part of a religion that's supposed to take over and not let anybody else of another religion live there.
[01:03:01.121 --> 01:03:06.064]  No atheists, no gays, no nothing.
[01:03:06.064 --> 01:03:14.010]  But then you have the atheists and the gays saying, bring in Islam.
[01:03:14.010 --> 01:03:16.051]  Nick Baggage is coming in.
[01:03:16.051 --> 01:03:21.234]  Dr. Nick Baggage to look at the state of the world in studio with us.
[01:03:21.234 --> 01:03:22.055]  And then we're going to
[01:03:26.186 --> 01:03:31.869]  Break down the fact that Democrats are again calling for censoring the independent press.
[01:03:31.869 --> 01:03:35.430]  And I know you as an audience know that, but think about that every minute.
[01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:44.315]  They want to muzzle the opposition to globalism that wants to make you poor and stupid and break down our society.
[01:03:44.315 --> 01:03:45.075]  This is a war.
[01:03:45.075 --> 01:03:48.597]  You have to take it like a war and have pleasure.
[01:03:48.597 --> 01:03:54.700]  Like it's a video game, but for real, when you're sharing links, when you're sharing articles, when you're sending out information.
[01:03:56.667 --> 01:04:02.849]  Don't engage the trolls they admittedly hire by the millions and have sock puppet bots to counter us by hateful comments back and forth.
[01:04:02.849 --> 01:04:05.570]  Just keep getting info out, links out.
[01:04:05.570 --> 01:04:11.633]  Just bring people together around basic Western freedom and we can do it together.
[01:04:11.633 --> 01:04:19.296]  So every color of people can live in peace but under a free market idea of live and let live, true libertarianism, Western renaissance.
[01:04:20.472 --> 01:04:26.357]  The globalists have already set it up demographically, where they are going to have total sectarian war forever by design.
[01:04:26.357 --> 01:04:34.364]  We absolutely must convert people, no matter what color they are, to the unifying cosmology of Americana.
[01:04:34.364 --> 01:04:44.113]  Which is freedom, and human empowerment, and daring, and rugged individualism, and transparency in government, and low taxes.
[01:04:44.113 --> 01:04:44.734]  Not elitism.
[01:04:46.385 --> 01:04:54.345]  The left has allied with Islam because the left now is an orthodox cult, controlling language, controlling everything.
[01:04:54.345 --> 01:04:55.848]  It is a classical cult.
[01:05:00.191 --> 01:05:03.992]  The health care reform hearing on the Hill today has been a clown act.
[01:05:03.992 --> 01:05:15.435]  You have Democrats taking the podium to passionately complain about the new health care bill, saying it's the worst ever, when it's still government-controlled health care, which is what they cheered for seven years ago, and still today.
[01:05:15.435 --> 01:05:18.216]  I'm beginning to think this was yet another Trump troll.
[01:05:18.216 --> 01:05:26.058]  Make Democrats stop progress of a GOP health care bill that's virtually the same bill they complained the GOP was stopping the progress of.
[01:05:26.058 --> 01:05:28.019]  The epitome of partisan politics.
[01:05:28.599 --> 01:05:34.960]  Democrats are also complaining they haven't seen the bill, but here was Nancy Pelosi when fighting for Obamacare.
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:39.981]  But we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it.
[01:05:39.981 --> 01:05:45.442]  She's having hearings today, trying to stop the new health care bill, complaining she hasn't seen it.
[01:05:45.442 --> 01:05:47.863]  What an absolute fraud.
[01:05:47.863 --> 01:05:51.184]  Just chalk this up to more fallout from Obama fail.
[01:05:51.184 --> 01:05:55.524]  Trump is meeting with the House Freedom Caucus today, who could stall the bill in the House.
[01:05:55.524 --> 01:05:58.025]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[01:06:00.026 --> 01:06:02.629]  Because of what we did on this day, change has come to America.
[01:06:15.655 --> 01:06:21.377]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces, bent on global governance.
[01:06:21.377 --> 01:06:33.940]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie, God was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper.
[01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:36.361]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[01:06:36.641 --> 01:06:37.822]  We're the solution!
[01:06:37.822 --> 01:06:38.783]  Americans!
[01:06:38.783 --> 01:06:40.344]  Ain't nothin' more to it than that!
[01:06:40.344 --> 01:06:45.729]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, and Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[01:06:45.729 --> 01:06:47.410]  Theatrical screenings on demand.
[01:06:47.410 --> 01:06:49.311]  DVDs now available.
[01:06:49.311 --> 01:06:52.734]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[01:06:52.734 --> 01:06:55.517]  Americans need to see this film.
[01:06:55.517 --> 01:07:02.602]  REVELATION THE MOVIE.INFO Let's fix it.
[01:07:02.602 --> 01:07:04.004]  Let's go to David in Florida.
[01:07:04.004 --> 01:07:05.305]  David in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:07:06.232 --> 01:07:06.672]  Great!
[01:07:06.672 --> 01:07:07.813]  Hey, thank you so much.
[01:07:07.813 --> 01:07:12.336]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[01:07:12.336 --> 01:07:14.037]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[01:07:14.037 --> 01:07:21.621]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret 12, Vitamin Interfusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[01:07:21.621 --> 01:07:22.422]  Wow, thank you.
[01:07:22.422 --> 01:07:24.843]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[01:07:24.843 --> 01:07:26.404]  Which Nutraceutical does you like best?
[01:07:26.644 --> 01:07:30.125]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[01:07:30.125 --> 01:07:30.526]  That's amazing.
[01:07:30.526 --> 01:07:31.406]  That's really incredible.
[01:07:31.406 --> 01:07:34.467]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[01:07:34.467 --> 01:07:35.808]  Like, I haven't felt asleep.
[01:07:35.808 --> 01:07:37.469]  My morning was fantastic.
[01:07:37.469 --> 01:07:38.729]  And I love you guys.
[01:07:38.729 --> 01:07:40.870]  I love the InfoWars crew.
[01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:47.733]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[01:07:47.733 --> 01:07:48.773]  You will love it.
[01:07:48.773 --> 01:07:49.273]  I'm telling you.
[01:07:49.273 --> 01:07:50.594]  I've never bought a bad product.
[01:07:50.894 --> 01:07:55.320]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:56.221]  It's a win-win.
[01:07:56.221 --> 01:07:56.982]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:08:05.501 --> 01:08:15.691]  They're intentionally leaving the borders open in Europe, bringing in mass refugees, among them are going to be jihadists, who are setting up a future Tet offensive, Tet-style offensive in Europe.
[01:08:15.691 --> 01:08:17.713]  And the same thing's being done to this country.
[01:08:17.713 --> 01:08:28.124]  On her way to work one morning, down the path along the lake, a tender-hearted woman saw a poor, half-frozen snake.
[01:08:29.813 --> 01:08:34.775]  His pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew.
[01:08:34.775 --> 01:08:36.335]  Oh well, she cried.
[01:08:36.335 --> 01:08:37.556]  I'll take you in.
[01:08:37.556 --> 01:08:39.796]  And I'll take care of you.
[01:08:39.796 --> 01:08:41.817]  Take me in, oh tender woman.
[01:08:41.817 --> 01:08:43.758]  Take me in for heaven's sake.
[01:08:43.758 --> 01:08:46.378]  Take me in, oh tender woman.
[01:08:46.378 --> 01:08:50.980]  Sighed the vicious snake.
[01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:53.521]  Take me in, oh tender woman.
[01:08:53.521 --> 01:08:55.801]  Take me in for heaven's sake.
[01:08:55.801 --> 01:08:57.302]  Take me in, oh tender woman.
[01:08:58.339 --> 01:09:02.341]  Inside the vicious snake.
[01:09:02.341 --> 01:09:05.302]  Now she clutched him to her bosom.
[01:09:05.302 --> 01:09:07.963]  You're so beautiful, she cried.
[01:09:07.963 --> 01:09:13.346]  But if I hadn't brought you in by now, you might have died.
[01:09:13.346 --> 01:09:18.388]  She stroked his pretty skin and then she kissed and held him tight.
[01:09:19.451 --> 01:09:27.518]  But instead of saying thank you, that snake gave her a vicious bite.
[01:09:27.518 --> 01:09:29.140]  I saved you, cried the woman.
[01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:33.802]  And you've bit me, heavens why?
[01:09:33.802 --> 01:09:39.305]  You know your bite is poisonous, and now I'm going to die.
[01:09:39.305 --> 01:09:44.247]  Oh shut up, silly woman, said the reptile with a grin.
[01:09:44.247 --> 01:09:49.410]  You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.
[01:09:53.069 --> 01:09:59.534]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:09:59.534 --> 01:10:02.996]  You know, I was just talking to Dr. Nick Begich, who I've just met for the first time.
[01:10:02.996 --> 01:10:05.718]  I've been interviewing him for about 20 years.
[01:10:05.718 --> 01:10:06.439]  Right.
[01:10:06.439 --> 01:10:07.760]  And he's a best-selling author.
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:17.607]  Of course, his father was a famous reformer and congressman who was killed in a plane crash, clearly by foul play, Dr. Begich believes.
[01:10:17.607 --> 01:10:19.789]  I think it's clear his brother, obviously, was just an outgoing
[01:10:20.689 --> 01:10:38.423]  US Senator from Alaska and nobody has trailblazed more in the last 23 years or so since you've been, at least I know of your books being out, than Dr. Nick Baggage, going to the patents and going to the research and going to the white papers of what they admit they've got.
[01:10:38.423 --> 01:10:40.244]  And so I want to talk about the breakaway civilization.
[01:10:40.244 --> 01:10:41.385]  I want to explain what that is.
[01:10:41.385 --> 01:10:41.846]  I want to talk about
[01:10:42.748 --> 01:10:43.869]  What else is going on?
[01:10:59.707 --> 01:11:03.612]  Well, baggage was talking about that again 20 years ago, and now here it is.
[01:11:03.612 --> 01:11:07.157]  And I didn't just have baggage as a source, I had NSA whistleblowers, you name it.
[01:11:07.157 --> 01:11:11.263]  And I was like a mainline Republican, kind of Libertarian, when I first got on air 22 years ago.
[01:11:11.263 --> 01:11:16.129]  I knew some stuff, but I just, it was my listeners that were actually informed, and my guests.
[01:11:17.219 --> 01:11:19.040]  And here we are.
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:22.582]  So he's with us a little bit in the next hour, then we're going to hopefully get him down to South by Southwest.
[01:11:22.582 --> 01:11:28.926]  And so I was thinking of having you, you know, go down as like, you know, the expert on the technocracy and just look how they're selling it down there.
[01:11:28.926 --> 01:11:31.708]  But I know you've already been there, so perhaps you can speak some to that.
[01:11:31.708 --> 01:11:42.615]  But really just prefacing this, most folks know who you are, obviously, and when you're EarthPulse.com and the great organization you run, trying to inform people how you expose the Tesla technologies that the FBI seized.
[01:11:43.826 --> 01:11:52.055]  Harp, The Betrayal of Science and Society and the Soul, your Earth Rising series, your Mind Control book.
[01:11:52.055 --> 01:11:53.777]  You go off what's admitted.
[01:11:53.777 --> 01:11:57.681]  And again, it's way beyond what we even see in the news today.
[01:11:57.681 --> 01:12:02.966]  But I just want the right-wing people to understand, the left-wing people to understand everybody.
[01:12:02.966 --> 01:12:06.430]  It's all about making you think you're part of the system or you're part of some winning group.
[01:12:07.827 --> 01:12:16.592]  When you buy into the whole control paradigm, there's no doubt that you're not part of the elite, that there's only a few hundred of these people, and they're not even winners either.
[01:12:16.592 --> 01:12:18.373]  They're psychopaths, basically.
[01:12:18.373 --> 01:12:19.013]  That's my opinion.
[01:12:19.013 --> 01:12:21.695]  We'll get yours, and we'll give you the floor in a moment.
[01:12:21.695 --> 01:12:27.077]  But that's really what's so frustrating to me, is they believe they're ugly.
[01:12:27.077 --> 01:12:29.719]  They're projecting their hatred on the general public.
[01:12:29.719 --> 01:12:33.161]  They're setting up cultural systems to make us ugly and dumb, and it's working.
[01:12:34.363 --> 01:12:36.284]  But it feeds back and only makes them worse.
[01:12:36.284 --> 01:12:43.710]  And some elites are recognizing this because at the level I've gotten, I've pretty much talked to you name it.
[01:12:43.710 --> 01:12:45.371]  I'll just leave it at that.
[01:12:45.371 --> 01:12:47.252]  And even a lot of their own people are freaked out.
[01:12:47.252 --> 01:12:52.156]  Their wives and their husbands are freaked out at the people that are right next to the highest level.
[01:12:52.156 --> 01:12:55.618]  They claim there's a 6,000 group, a superclass that manages things.
[01:12:55.618 --> 01:12:57.400]  I was been offered to be part of that.
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:58.340]  But that's the gophers.
[01:12:58.340 --> 01:12:59.601]  There's 6,000 gophers.
[01:12:59.601 --> 01:13:00.141]  There's only
[01:13:01.018 --> 01:13:07.520]  A few hundred people at the top that are managing this thing, and it's the darkest, most evil things I also want to talk about today.
[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:08.320]  The heart of it.
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:09.641]  Maybe we should start at the end.
[01:13:09.641 --> 01:13:11.921]  Where are they taking us from your deep research?
[01:13:11.921 --> 01:13:13.242]  Where is it going, Dr. Baggish?
[01:13:13.242 --> 01:13:18.264]  Because I know you like to only show people what's going on, let them make their own conclusion.
[01:13:18.264 --> 01:13:19.104]  We've talked privately.
[01:13:19.964 --> 01:13:23.386]  Maybe we should start at the end and then go back to the beginning.
[01:13:23.386 --> 01:13:24.686]  What governs it?
[01:13:24.686 --> 01:13:25.446]  What is it?
[01:13:25.446 --> 01:13:27.027]  We know it's taking us somewhere bad.
[01:13:27.027 --> 01:13:28.068]  It admits it.
[01:13:28.068 --> 01:13:30.028]  It says it's a post-human world.
[01:13:30.028 --> 01:13:30.849]  What are we facing?
[01:13:30.849 --> 01:13:32.109]  It's great to have Dr. Nick Baggage.
[01:13:32.109 --> 01:13:46.515]  I'm not going to go into all of his degrees and all the things he's been involved in, all the things that, all over the world, and also representing Native tribes successfully to get them major concessions and oil and gas, you name it, a true Robin Hood for the people.
[01:13:46.515 --> 01:13:47.496]  So it's great to have you here, my friend.
[01:13:47.836 --> 01:13:50.498]  Thank you very much, and it's my pleasure to be here with you, Alex.
[01:13:50.498 --> 01:13:54.361]  It's 20 years of working together, and finally we get to see each other.
[01:13:54.361 --> 01:13:56.002]  And this is a tough time.
[01:13:56.002 --> 01:14:01.826]  And I wanted to come down, meet you in Austin, and show my support for you.
[01:14:01.826 --> 01:14:06.529]  And encourage listeners, you know, the alternative news is the only real news.
[01:14:07.148 --> 01:14:09.289]  And Alex, you've been at this as long as I have.
[01:14:09.289 --> 01:14:11.330]  We started around the same time.
[01:14:11.330 --> 01:14:13.691]  And it is time to wake up America.
[01:14:13.691 --> 01:14:21.716]  It's time to recognize that the support that people like Alex need right now is critical to retaining the Republic.
[01:14:21.716 --> 01:14:28.659]  And there's a lot of issues out there, but the most pressing issues right now have now come into the forefront.
[01:14:28.659 --> 01:14:33.702]  Twenty years of talking about personal privacy and liberty being stripped away from us a slice at a time.
[01:14:34.342 --> 01:14:42.190]  And here we are in 2017 at the threshold of big changes and the left is panicked.
[01:14:42.190 --> 01:14:44.873]  They're panicked because the agenda is over.
[01:14:44.873 --> 01:14:48.777]  The game is up and people are waking up.
[01:14:48.777 --> 01:14:52.862]  Again, I'm going to try to interrupt because if I do, we know where that goes.
[01:14:54.767 --> 01:15:00.110]  If I had 10 extra crew members, I would have them chronicle everything you say, I say, other people say.
[01:15:00.110 --> 01:15:05.453]  I remembered you 15 years ago saying, Alex, things are going to get bad, but they're going to get better.
[01:15:05.453 --> 01:15:12.217]  By sometime around before 2020, we're predicting a mass awakening, and the elite are scared of these massive human potentials.
[01:15:12.217 --> 01:15:21.882]  I know you can't get into a lot of it because you've talked to some groups and some of the elite and some classified stuff, but there are groups in the elite that actually want to empower humanity, but the big dominant group is wanting to suppress it.
[01:15:21.882 --> 01:15:22.463]  I'm getting chills.
[01:15:23.303 --> 01:15:25.544]  I know Trump is a true attempted breakthrough.
[01:15:25.544 --> 01:15:28.726]  It's what he said in his statement at his inaugural.
[01:15:28.726 --> 01:15:29.986]  There's life extension.
[01:15:29.986 --> 01:15:31.347]  We're about to unlock the keys.
[01:15:31.347 --> 01:15:33.448]  They know the keys are already being unlocked.
[01:15:33.448 --> 01:15:34.909]  Trump wants to transfer that to people.
[01:15:34.909 --> 01:15:36.130]  I'm getting chills.
[01:15:36.130 --> 01:15:42.953]  But how did you predict that, at least 15 years ago, that around this time this would be the big battle?
[01:15:42.953 --> 01:15:52.518]  Well, you know, going back to the beginning of the work, it was in the mid-90s, and when we started looking at the trends and really tracking those trends, and not with
[01:15:53.898 --> 01:16:00.981]  In the phone booth kind of conversation with real hard documents, something that we're well known for, it became obvious where it was headed.
[01:16:00.981 --> 01:16:07.643]  And at some point, you know, the public gets to the point where they just won't stand it anymore.
[01:16:07.643 --> 01:16:12.344]  And the objective of the public is information, public media.
[01:16:12.344 --> 01:16:16.485]  The critical element is not just saying whatever you want, it's keeping the informed public.
[01:16:16.485 --> 01:16:17.886]  That's what Freedom of the Press was about.
[01:16:18.406 --> 01:16:28.289]  Why I got involved in this was we saw the mainstream, really the corporate tool for manipulating not just culture, but I travel all over the world.
[01:16:28.289 --> 01:16:33.391]  We see the same overlays in Europe, in the US, Latin America.
[01:16:34.211 --> 01:16:38.233]  But they kind of culturally correct it, so that they can influence the same outcomes.
[01:16:38.233 --> 01:16:39.393]  And that's where we are today.
[01:16:39.393 --> 01:16:44.155]  So they're using the anthropology and they admit it, and when you see it, it's so sick.
[01:16:44.155 --> 01:16:48.636]  Like PSAs, don't sleep with your baby, give it formula.
[01:16:48.636 --> 01:16:53.938]  Well they know that reduces IQ 15-20 points, makes the person basically a sociopath.
[01:16:54.946 --> 01:16:56.067]  I mean, it's amazing.
[01:16:56.067 --> 01:16:58.208]  You know, and that's exactly it.
[01:16:58.208 --> 01:17:00.950]  It's a case of dumbing the population down.
[01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:05.453]  I was in public education for a number of years, looking at how that has changed.
[01:17:05.453 --> 01:17:07.434]  Where are the thinking people?
[01:17:07.434 --> 01:17:12.477]  And they're plugged into the alternative media, where there is a remnant of truth that comes out.
[01:17:12.477 --> 01:17:12.858]  Exactly.
[01:17:12.858 --> 01:17:19.422]  Dr. Becker, so what does it say about an elite, not just in their white papers, when they want to dumb people down and then disease us?
[01:17:19.422 --> 01:17:22.164]  Because you're always saying, Alex, you worry about vaccines all day.
[01:17:22.164 --> 01:17:23.385]  It's the electromagnetic
[01:17:24.301 --> 01:17:27.924]  That's where the real... They really want to raise your chair for some reason.
[01:17:27.924 --> 01:17:29.766]  Let's just go ahead and do it.
[01:17:29.766 --> 01:17:31.007]  Hey, it's live.
[01:17:31.007 --> 01:17:31.767]  It's no big deal, folks.
[01:17:31.767 --> 01:17:32.968]  We're teleprompter-free here.
[01:17:32.968 --> 01:17:34.429]  This is the best part of the show.
[01:17:34.429 --> 01:17:35.570]  Again, Dr. Dick Meyers is our guest.
[01:17:35.570 --> 01:17:36.411]  That happens to me all the time.
[01:17:36.411 --> 01:17:37.532]  I'll hit the button and it falls down.
[01:17:37.532 --> 01:17:38.293]  Oops.
[01:17:38.293 --> 01:17:39.193]  Who cares?
[01:17:39.193 --> 01:17:44.698]  But I mean, seriously, we're not here... They script themselves as savers of the earth wanting to tax carbon.
[01:17:44.698 --> 01:17:47.961]  While they're genetically engineering, doing all this stuff we know is actually hurting the earth,
[01:17:48.641 --> 01:17:52.626]  And then they admit in their own internal documents they're going to overwrite the whole planet.
[01:17:52.626 --> 01:17:56.972]  They think they're God, like Promethean engineers, you know, in the Prometheus movie.
[01:17:56.972 --> 01:17:58.995]  That's who they think they are.
[01:17:58.995 --> 01:18:00.597]  And they just think we're like a bug.
[01:18:00.597 --> 01:18:04.743]  I mean, even Elon Musk last month said, oh, you'll assimilate or you'll just be squashed like a bug.
[01:18:05.239 --> 01:18:06.621]  Well, and this is the attitude.
[01:18:06.621 --> 01:18:10.244]  It's a lack of humanity in multinationals.
[01:18:10.244 --> 01:18:18.653]  You know, the Supreme Court's given multinationals and global organizations the same rights as living human souls.
[01:18:18.653 --> 01:18:19.814]  This is a big problem.
[01:18:19.814 --> 01:18:25.260]  This is taking away... And now they want to give computers souls and quote tax them, but that means the elites program them.
[01:18:25.260 --> 01:18:25.761]  They're not human.
[01:18:26.081 --> 01:18:26.962]  That's correct.
[01:18:26.962 --> 01:18:35.367]  In fact, I read a statistic today, 57% of jobs worldwide are going to evaporate over the next 10 to 15 years.
[01:18:35.367 --> 01:18:37.468]  Now what happens to all those people?
[01:18:37.468 --> 01:18:47.554]  And you know, even today in the United States, the statistics just came out in the New York Times, rising suicide rates among white males, white women, by over 130% increases over the last 20 years.
[01:18:49.835 --> 01:18:50.415]  24 U.S.
[01:18:50.415 --> 01:18:52.936]  soldiers committed suicide a day, record number.
[01:18:52.936 --> 01:18:54.277]  That's a test program group.
[01:18:54.277 --> 01:19:00.299]  Just like the black community is a test group, the military is a test group at taking our best people and killing them, enslaving them, dumbing them down.
[01:19:00.299 --> 01:19:02.300]  But you've got to toot your horn.
[01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:04.201]  Talk about Earth rising.
[01:19:04.201 --> 01:19:12.884]  Even before the book came out, you talked about what the elite are scared of and how you were able to predict around 2017, 2018, this was coming, a decade plus ago.
[01:19:12.884 --> 01:19:13.384]  How did you do it?
[01:19:13.644 --> 01:19:20.689]  The Earth Rising Revolution was a book written just pre 9-11 and it was published in 2000 as a warning.
[01:19:20.689 --> 01:19:27.494]  Over 640 source documents were cited showing the trends in terms of personal privacy and personal liberty.
[01:19:27.494 --> 01:19:32.698]  The things you see now in the mainstream about surveillance, we were talking about this almost 17 years ago.
[01:19:34.659 --> 01:19:37.962]  And it was really clear to see where we were headed.
[01:19:37.962 --> 01:19:40.223]  And where we're headed is where we are right now.
[01:19:40.223 --> 01:19:44.686]  At the point of revolutionary thinking on both the left and the right.
[01:19:44.686 --> 01:19:48.909]  But the kind of revolution we need is a revolution of thinking again.
[01:19:48.909 --> 01:19:52.972]  Getting outside left and right, and just like I was thinking, the left.
[01:19:53.712 --> 01:19:55.393]  It's just one of the modalities of the elite right now.
[01:20:13.936 --> 01:20:16.840]  The anti-human message, the anti-family message.
[01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:17.841]  And that really is it.
[01:20:17.841 --> 01:20:30.656]  It's just really taking the humanity out and looking at us as taxpayers, consumers, as people that really don't have much to do except to be the drones for an elite class.
[01:20:30.656 --> 01:20:31.878]  And now they say we're not needed.
[01:20:33.464 --> 01:20:34.365]  Who are the globalists?
[01:20:34.365 --> 01:20:36.686]  What's their endgame?
[01:20:36.686 --> 01:20:39.648]  How do you think we're doing in our awakening?
[01:20:39.648 --> 01:20:41.089]  I think people are awakening.
[01:20:41.089 --> 01:20:43.551]  I think this election was a prime example of it.
[01:20:43.551 --> 01:20:48.614]  Both the left and the right changed their views in terms of how this election went.
[01:20:48.614 --> 01:20:52.377]  Hillary was rejected because she's an evil person.
[01:20:52.377 --> 01:20:53.418]  I mean, what can I say?
[01:20:53.418 --> 01:20:59.522]  She had the most manipulative, power-hungry, entitlement attitude towards government.
[01:21:00.023 --> 01:21:07.532]  And I can fairly say you come out of the classic good left Americana that we know of, of just being democratic.
[01:21:08.993 --> 01:21:10.033]  And you're saying that?
[01:21:10.033 --> 01:21:10.533]  I am.
[01:21:10.533 --> 01:21:18.475]  And in fact, I haven't been a Democrat in a number of years, but I am in a very well-known Democratic family in my region of the world.
[01:21:18.475 --> 01:21:22.396]  And my Christmas holidays are a big debate.
[01:21:22.396 --> 01:21:26.417]  And what we know is the left and right paradigm doesn't matter.
[01:21:26.417 --> 01:21:29.498]  I have both in my family, and we can still get along.
[01:21:29.498 --> 01:21:30.098]  We can still
[01:21:30.618 --> 01:21:33.802]  Debate heavily and come to informed conclusions.
[01:21:33.802 --> 01:21:41.050]  That's what the American public really wants is a discussion, an open discussion, not a panic party of the left.
[01:21:41.050 --> 01:21:42.371]  And that's what we're seeing right now.
[01:21:42.371 --> 01:21:43.252]  Why?
[01:21:43.252 --> 01:21:44.714]  Because they're unraveling.
[01:21:44.714 --> 01:21:51.301]  Because what they've tried to do in manipulating the population and taking us to a place that none of us want to go is over.
[01:21:52.983 --> 01:21:57.987]  The attacks on Trump is because he's effective, because he's making a difference.
[01:21:57.987 --> 01:22:01.951]  He took the media, he continues to take the media right where he wants them.
[01:22:01.951 --> 01:22:07.135]  And unfortunately, you know, we have to still use alternative to get the data.
[01:22:07.135 --> 01:22:16.083]  You know, something I had suggested at one point was bringing back the fireside chat, which I heard one of your guest hosts mentioning again on the air yesterday.
[01:22:16.523 --> 01:22:21.284]  This is something Roosevelt did when the media and the elites did not like him when he came in.
[01:22:21.284 --> 01:22:28.646]  He had a weekly show, he did his time, he gave people direct information and bypassed the media entirely.
[01:22:28.646 --> 01:22:33.067]  That's what we need again today, and that's what we're seeing, is we're seeing a bypass of the media.
[01:22:33.067 --> 01:22:36.928]  It's not controlled, it's not scripted, and that is changing all of it.
[01:22:37.268 --> 01:22:37.929]  Absolutely.
[01:22:37.929 --> 01:22:40.732]  You know, Roosevelt did some things I didn't like, but he was a complex character.
[01:22:40.732 --> 01:22:43.635]  There really were coup attempts against him.
[01:22:43.635 --> 01:22:44.776]  The Germans tried it.
[01:22:44.776 --> 01:22:47.338]  The McCormick-Dickson Committee exposed that.
[01:22:47.338 --> 01:22:51.543]  And he really did have to bypass the media, I guess Hearst and others at the time.
[01:22:51.543 --> 01:22:55.747]  So whether you love him or hate him, his model is what Trump should be doing.
[01:22:56.307 --> 01:22:57.208]  I totally believe it.
[01:22:57.208 --> 01:23:03.453]  I think a direct access to the public, bypass the media, that's the answer in the 21st century.
[01:23:03.453 --> 01:23:06.255]  We have to recognize the media is a flat world.
[01:23:06.255 --> 01:23:09.478]  You can take control of it if you want to by jumping in.
[01:23:09.478 --> 01:23:14.281]  No one's going to ignore the President of the United States, but they're certainly going to manipulate his speech.
[01:23:14.281 --> 01:23:21.887]  Now, I know we've had a few private discussions and things, but you've obviously worked and interviewed and been involved in some research.
[01:23:22.688 --> 01:23:25.291]  About why the elites are poisoning us, dumbing us down.
[01:23:25.291 --> 01:23:26.612]  It's not just to control us.
[01:23:26.612 --> 01:23:30.857]  They're worried about something that humans are advancing into.
[01:23:30.857 --> 01:23:34.340]  Now, whether you believe this or not, folks, the elite, from my own research, believe this.
[01:23:34.340 --> 01:23:37.463]  But I know, I've asked you twice, you're not getting into it right now.
[01:23:37.463 --> 01:23:39.605]  I guess, can you get into what?
[01:23:39.605 --> 01:23:44.751]  I mean, I know you don't get into the realms of speculation, but what the elites believe and what they're trying to suppress.
[01:23:45.211 --> 01:23:48.192]  Actually, it is the next evolution of human beings.
[01:23:48.192 --> 01:24:00.596]  It's where we reach our higher states of awareness, where we have control of what is referred to biblically as the gifts of the spirit, others call extra-sensory perceptions, the military calls anomalous human capabilities.
[01:24:00.596 --> 01:24:02.897]  I had the opportunity... It happens all the time when you're synced up with people!
[01:24:03.397 --> 01:24:04.357]  That's correct.
[01:24:04.357 --> 01:24:05.478]  That's what family is.
[01:24:05.478 --> 01:24:06.258]  That's what it is.
[01:24:06.258 --> 01:24:07.618]  In fact, it's the typeset.
[01:24:07.618 --> 01:24:09.499]  It's the program.
[01:24:09.499 --> 01:24:14.120]  You know, what you do in a family in creating union between two people is a typeset.
[01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:17.260]  It is what we are supposed to be doing with everyone.
[01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:19.761]  We recognize our connection to everyone.
[01:24:19.761 --> 01:24:23.422]  We recognize that we have the ability to reach a higher state of awareness.
[01:24:23.422 --> 01:24:26.724]  And that's obviously what Martin Luther King or anybody that was awake says.
[01:24:26.724 --> 01:24:32.868]  It's about not what color we are, it's what we stand for, what we build, what we do, and then it's the opposite of collectivism.
[01:24:32.868 --> 01:24:39.413]  It's individualism, but it moves to a collective because that's what individuals will choose to do when the time comes.
[01:24:40.113 --> 01:24:48.159]  It is indeed, and it is about individual choices, about individual direction, and through that strong individual character, a nation is built.
[01:24:48.159 --> 01:24:59.087]  Not by groupthink, squishy groupthink, and that's what we're seeing way, way too much of within our educational systems, within the way the media tries to herd us into a direction.
[01:24:59.087 --> 01:25:03.191]  And we've seen a devastating defeat, not just here, but across the planet, of groupthink,
[01:25:04.231 --> 01:25:06.852]  Look, Wilders won the Netherlands.
[01:25:06.852 --> 01:25:10.453]  The Nationalists won in Austria.
[01:25:10.453 --> 01:25:12.134]  I've looked at the numbers.
[01:25:12.134 --> 01:25:14.495]  They were like 15, 20 points ahead.
[01:25:14.495 --> 01:25:17.896]  Everywhere else where they have real elections, the Nationalists are winning.
[01:25:17.896 --> 01:25:19.117]  And again, that's what's exciting.
[01:25:19.117 --> 01:25:22.498]  Not that Nationalists are perfect, but Globalists are the big corporate
[01:25:23.504 --> 01:25:30.052]  World Government Board of Technocracy, in their own words, they're bringing in the final revolution that ends competition.
[01:25:30.052 --> 01:25:31.574]  That's why they're the shared enemy.
[01:25:31.574 --> 01:25:38.543]  And the fact that it's the intelligence agencies that we've both been huge critics of, but they got decompartmentalized by your books and the research and
[01:25:39.644 --> 01:25:41.065]  And great shows like Coast to Coast AM.
[01:25:41.065 --> 01:25:44.567]  You can laugh at some of the fun stuff they do, but that was a big icebreaker.
[01:25:44.567 --> 01:25:47.869]  And the intelligence agencies listened to us and they said, my God, you're right.
[01:25:47.869 --> 01:26:02.438]  To the point I've learned from so many sources, from CIA assassins, to war heroes, to former CIA section chiefs, to top analysts, to you name it, in different agencies, to deputy directors, you know, to heads of technical of the NSA.
[01:26:03.999 --> 01:26:15.607]  That literally my show and the guests we had were the critical junctures the last 20 years and other broadcasts to see what they were already seeing and then to decompartmentalize.
[01:26:15.607 --> 01:26:17.469]  Yeah, and this is exactly it.
[01:26:17.469 --> 01:26:19.590]  It's the nature of independent research.
[01:26:19.590 --> 01:26:25.514]  You know, most of the stuff that I've covered, in fact everything I've ever printed, was non-classified by the time it was used.
[01:26:25.514 --> 01:26:30.538]  It doesn't say that it wasn't classified later, but the fact of the matter... They reclassified a lot of stuff you've covered.
[01:26:30.658 --> 01:26:35.662]  Oh yeah, and you know, the fact of the matter is, we have an opportunity to change the country.
[01:26:35.662 --> 01:26:37.163]  And making an example for the world.
[01:26:37.163 --> 01:26:43.688]  Not interfering in all the world's politics, but recognizing the sovereign right of independent countries to function within their boundaries.
[01:26:43.688 --> 01:26:49.072]  And leading by the fact we are the greatest expression of the renaissance, even if we've wilted, it can come back.
[01:26:49.312 --> 01:26:51.313]  It can come back, and it is coming back.
[01:26:51.313 --> 01:26:59.377]  In fact, some of the best science minds in the world, I had an opportunity to meet here in Dallas a few years ago while I was working with the LA Institute on Technology.
[01:26:59.377 --> 01:27:03.760]  These are some of the top people in science in terms of consciousness.
[01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:09.363]  And the whole issue was on the idea of mind effects and what we can do with the human mind.
[01:27:11.724 --> 01:27:18.890]  To a person who recognizes that this next evolution, this is the challenge of the 21st century.
[01:27:18.890 --> 01:27:20.631]  Fully awake individuals.
[01:27:20.631 --> 01:27:24.794]  And you know the one thing that stops us from reaching that is fear and worry.
[01:27:24.794 --> 01:27:26.836]  You cannot reach higher states of awareness.
[01:27:27.216 --> 01:27:29.958]  And you always keep telling me this, and people thought I was in fear.
[01:27:29.958 --> 01:27:32.900]  I was more in anger, trying to agitate people to get involved.
[01:27:32.900 --> 01:27:38.364]  But now, more and more, when I turn loose of even fear that I'm not doing... I don't physically fear for myself or anything.
[01:27:38.364 --> 01:27:39.965]  I fear that I'm not doing a good enough job.
[01:27:39.965 --> 01:27:40.606]  It's like a guilt.
[01:27:40.606 --> 01:27:47.551]  And finally, I'm saying I'm doing the best I can, and when the guilt pills away, my thought process is like five times stronger.
[01:27:47.811 --> 01:27:50.332]  Absolutely, and this is the key element.
[01:27:50.332 --> 01:27:51.473]  You do the best you can.
[01:27:51.473 --> 01:27:53.094]  That doesn't mean we always win.
[01:27:53.094 --> 01:27:54.895]  It just means that we keep trying.
[01:27:54.895 --> 01:27:56.796]  And that is the essence of it.
[01:27:56.796 --> 01:28:03.520]  If every single person listening to this broadcast woke up in the morning and made an effort for change in this country, even a small one,
[01:28:03.900 --> 01:28:04.621]  They add up.
[01:28:04.621 --> 01:28:06.162]  There's millions of people listening.
[01:28:06.162 --> 01:28:08.184]  There's millions of people participating.
[01:28:08.184 --> 01:28:10.326]  There's an organization... And it's not just the physical action, is it?
[01:28:10.326 --> 01:28:16.911]  The third dimension has been proven by mathematics that us consciously wanting something, it isn't like magic, like the secret just happens.
[01:28:16.911 --> 01:28:17.732]  No, we can build.
[01:28:17.732 --> 01:28:18.333]  Look what we've done.
[01:28:18.333 --> 01:28:20.935]  It interconnects and our dreams are interconnected.
[01:28:21.475 --> 01:28:24.638]  You know, this actually is, in fact, the truth of the matter.
[01:28:24.638 --> 01:28:29.321]  A collective conscious, if you will, a direction that's moved.
[01:28:29.321 --> 01:28:30.722]  Now, the elite understand this.
[01:28:30.722 --> 01:28:32.383]  That's why they use the media the way they want.
[01:28:32.383 --> 01:28:33.524]  Well, they poison the collective conscious.
[01:28:33.524 --> 01:28:34.445]  That's exactly right.
[01:28:34.445 --> 01:28:39.168]  By keeping people in a constant state of agitation and fear, we're already defeated.
[01:28:39.168 --> 01:28:40.409]  We have to let it go.
[01:28:40.409 --> 01:28:45.893]  We have to recognize that that fear is conquered by knowledge and action, effective action.
[01:28:45.933 --> 01:28:47.895]  So when I cover an Islamic attack, I want to be clear.
[01:28:47.895 --> 01:28:49.137]  I'm not trying to create fear.
[01:28:49.137 --> 01:28:52.040]  I'm saying look how they're lying and saying this isn't an attack.
[01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:53.702]  They're using this to take your freedoms.
[01:28:53.702 --> 01:28:54.943]  We shouldn't allow this.
[01:28:54.943 --> 01:28:56.105]  That's exactly right.
[01:28:56.105 --> 01:29:00.490]  Now I have a business partner in Germany, and in Germany they suppress everything.
[01:29:01.170 --> 01:29:04.732]  Everything about Islam, in terms of what they're doing.
[01:29:04.732 --> 01:29:09.335]  And there were, at one point, hundreds, hundreds of rapes across the country.
[01:29:09.335 --> 01:29:09.776]  Oh yeah.
[01:29:09.776 --> 01:29:10.696]  And they weren't reported.
[01:29:10.696 --> 01:29:17.080]  In fact, the media isn't allowed to talk about religion in the context of reporting the news.
[01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:18.641]  And that's come out in the news, that's come out.
[01:29:18.641 --> 01:29:19.101]  Oh yeah.
[01:29:19.101 --> 01:29:26.226]  And this is, and you know, when I speak to my friends in Germany, now in Germany... You're being conservative by the way, it was hundreds of rapes per major city.
[01:29:26.226 --> 01:29:26.526]  Yes.
[01:29:26.526 --> 01:29:26.946]  Per year.
[01:29:26.946 --> 01:29:27.787]  That's correct.
[01:29:28.207 --> 01:29:31.989]  Like something like 80-something percent were Islamic, and the cops are not allowed to say it.
[01:29:31.989 --> 01:29:35.250]  But then the German news goes further and says German men rape.
[01:29:35.250 --> 01:29:40.072]  No, and this is wrong, and this is fundamentally wrong, and this is what's got Europe... Dr. Nick Begich is amazing.
[01:29:40.072 --> 01:29:44.594]  When we come back, I want to ask you, why are the globalists so in bed with orthodox, radical Islam?
[01:29:44.594 --> 01:29:45.694]  How can we reform Islam?
[01:29:45.694 --> 01:29:49.195]  Because I don't want to be in war with these people.
[01:29:49.195 --> 01:29:50.576]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.576 --> 01:29:53.117]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.117 --> 01:29:55.798]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.242 --> 01:30:04.726]  WikiLeaks continues to expose the nightmarish surveillance state in which we currently live.
[01:30:04.726 --> 01:30:14.755]  As the Vault 7 leaks continue, we learn more about how the surveillance grid works, and how governments use it to spy on interesting people, or how a hacker could get access to virtually anything.
[01:30:14.755 --> 01:30:18.398]  Now WikiLeaks has released Dark Matter, the latest leak in the Vault 7 collection.
[01:30:18.398 --> 01:30:25.504]  Dark Matter claims the CIA has been bugging cell phones right out of the factory since 2008, which is right when smartphones began to take over the market.
[01:30:25.504 --> 01:30:27.886]  This comes at the hands of the Embedded Development Branch,
[01:30:28.066 --> 01:30:28.867]  We're good to go.
[01:30:48.106 --> 01:30:50.807]  All of which seem to directly target Apple products.
[01:30:50.807 --> 01:30:55.509]  More we'll be breaking from WikiLeaks today on dark matter, including a live stream of Julian Assange.
[01:30:55.509 --> 01:30:57.910]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[01:30:57.910 --> 01:30:59.930]  Be careful with that government probe droid.
[01:30:59.930 --> 01:31:01.811]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[01:31:01.811 --> 01:31:03.832]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[01:31:03.832 --> 01:31:06.733]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[01:31:06.733 --> 01:31:09.314]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals,
[01:31:09.514 --> 01:31:12.795]  The elite is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:31:12.795 --> 01:31:21.977]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking Water Filtration Systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[01:31:21.977 --> 01:31:29.519]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[01:31:29.519 --> 01:31:37.542]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[01:31:37.542 --> 01:31:38.502]  The general public doesn't.
[01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:43.664]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:31:43.664 --> 01:31:47.247]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:31:47.247 --> 01:31:53.952]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[01:31:53.952 --> 01:31:58.056]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:32:00.231 --> 01:32:08.221]  InfoWars is partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:32:08.221 --> 01:32:14.890]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[01:32:14.890 --> 01:32:19.075]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology.
[01:32:19.195 --> 01:32:23.440]  That disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:29.306]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene.
[01:32:29.306 --> 01:32:32.450]  Defender armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[01:32:32.450 --> 01:32:38.216]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[01:32:38.536 --> 01:32:39.297]  It works.
[01:32:39.297 --> 01:32:47.624]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level Ballistic Resistance Certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.
[01:32:47.624 --> 01:32:57.512]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWareStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the InfoWare against the globalists all at the same time.
[01:32:57.512 --> 01:32:58.052]  A total 360 win.
[01:33:02.745 --> 01:33:05.386]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:05.386 --> 01:33:13.749]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:33:13.749 --> 01:33:25.454]  This planet and human intelligence is an unbelievably rich rain forest.
[01:33:26.613 --> 01:33:30.718]  And imagine if you're the elite, you want to control technology just like they've done for thousands of years.
[01:33:30.718 --> 01:33:33.541]  You want to control access to it.
[01:33:33.541 --> 01:33:39.088]  Dr. Nick Beggins, unlike anybody else, has been not so much a futurist, somebody that took what was already going on,
[01:33:41.781 --> 01:33:45.582]  And now we see it has become our dominant future.
[01:33:45.582 --> 01:33:48.443]  So I'm going to try to let him break all this down.
[01:33:48.443 --> 01:33:50.303]  But I said, so you're from South by Southwest.
[01:33:50.303 --> 01:33:50.923]  I heard you were in town.
[01:33:50.923 --> 01:33:56.404]  He said, no, I came to directly, you know, to talk to you because I see on the news where they're saying you're a Russian agent.
[01:33:56.404 --> 01:34:00.285]  You're under criminal investigation for actually being a Russian agent.
[01:34:00.285 --> 01:34:00.905]  Just insane.
[01:34:00.905 --> 01:34:02.126]  It's a chilling effect.
[01:34:02.126 --> 01:34:07.567]  So the president, anybody that supports him, they're now calling Rand Paul saying you are a agent of Putin.
[01:34:08.780 --> 01:34:15.902]  Now, Congressman Nunes is under, quote, calls for investigation by the Democrats because he said, yeah, Trump's being surveilled.
[01:34:15.902 --> 01:34:18.843]  He's the head of the House Intelligence Committee.
[01:34:18.843 --> 01:34:23.244]  He's been told by the agencies the president is being surveilled.
[01:34:23.244 --> 01:34:25.204]  But they admitted he was being surveilled months ago.
[01:34:25.204 --> 01:34:28.345]  So it's just such a war on reality.
[01:34:28.345 --> 01:34:34.367]  Speaking of funding the operation, everything we do is sell something that we personally use that's high quality.
[01:34:35.652 --> 01:34:39.173]  So that, you know, we care about the listeners, but also so you like it and want to order more of it.
[01:34:39.173 --> 01:34:41.674]  It's a 360 win.
[01:34:41.674 --> 01:34:48.276]  My dad, who is a dentist and former oral surgeon, he's retiring this year, produced Super Blue, even did the design.
[01:34:48.276 --> 01:34:56.879]  Non-fluoride toothpaste produced by the biggest maker here in the United States with iodine, nano silver, peppermint and tea tree oil.
[01:34:56.879 --> 01:34:59.339]  And we also have super high quality storable foods.
[01:34:59.339 --> 01:35:00.120]  We're not living in fear.
[01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:03.721]  We have the foods so that we're secure and aren't afraid.
[01:35:04.983 --> 01:35:10.946]  My Patriot Supply is the biggest company in the United States now after only eight years because they have the highest quality and lowest prices.
[01:35:10.946 --> 01:35:17.290]  I can get lower prices contractually by having sales occasionally by private labeling the storable foods.
[01:35:18.390 --> 01:35:21.853]  We sell both their full line and then it's private labeled InfoWare Select.
[01:35:21.853 --> 01:35:24.395]  Very same food, made the same time.
[01:35:24.395 --> 01:35:25.556]  It's 30 to 40% off.
[01:35:25.556 --> 01:35:26.737]  We only run this a few times a year.
[01:35:26.737 --> 01:35:27.958]  We're running it right now.
[01:35:27.958 --> 01:35:30.981]  InfoWareStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:35:30.981 --> 01:35:34.344]  InfoWareSelect.com.
[01:35:34.344 --> 01:35:35.365]  It'll take you right to the page.
[01:35:35.365 --> 01:35:36.286]  It has the food on it.
[01:35:36.286 --> 01:35:37.206]  But InfoWareStore.com.
[01:35:38.027 --> 01:35:39.328]  Is the umbrella site.
[01:35:39.328 --> 01:35:53.056]  And it doesn't mean Trump's perfect, or Pence certainly isn't perfect, but by wearing a Trump-Pence 2020 shirt, when they want to intimidate free speech, you meet like-minded people, you stand up against the bullies, and at $9.95, we make like five bucks on the shirt, and it helps us fund the operation.
[01:35:53.056 --> 01:35:54.717]  So get that as well.
[01:35:54.717 --> 01:35:58.920]  That's going to go up in price here pretty soon, but out of the gates, I wanted to discount it.
[01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:05.204]  You can find all the books and films and more that Dr. Begich has produced or written at earthpulse.com.
[01:36:05.204 --> 01:36:06.465]  Really trailblazing stuff.
[01:36:08.243 --> 01:36:12.605]  I know in the last five years or so, you've not been on air as much, you've not been doing as much.
[01:36:12.605 --> 01:36:15.147]  You were telling me you were taking care of a lot of research and things.
[01:36:15.147 --> 01:36:22.391]  Now you're kind of back, full power, because you were telling me this is the time, what we're seeing.
[01:36:22.391 --> 01:36:28.474]  And so I'm going to try to shut up now, break down other big trends, where you think this is going, what you think the globalists are going to do next.
[01:36:28.956 --> 01:36:32.478]  Well, a couple of things that are coming up.
[01:36:32.478 --> 01:36:38.002]  One is, of course, quantum computing, which we've talked about a little bit before, but I want to get into this a little bit today because
[01:36:38.975 --> 01:36:40.797]  Quantum computing is going to change everything.
[01:36:40.797 --> 01:36:46.081]  I mean, supercomputers today are huge by any stretch of the imagination.
[01:36:46.081 --> 01:36:53.267]  Quantum computing will do in one hour what a supercomputer does today in a trillion years.
[01:36:53.267 --> 01:36:54.048]  Let me say that again.
[01:36:54.048 --> 01:37:01.834]  The quantum computers that are coming will do in one hour what supercomputers today do, if they could, in a trillion years.
[01:37:02.598 --> 01:37:04.540]  This is a huge, huge change.
[01:37:04.540 --> 01:37:17.591]  That means all the data that's been collected, all the information that's been collected by private organizations, by government and by others, is all of a sudden going to become hackable instantly.
[01:37:17.591 --> 01:37:18.312]  I mean, think about it.
[01:37:18.312 --> 01:37:19.893]  There will be no security code.
[01:37:19.893 --> 01:37:20.554]  There will be no
[01:37:22.175 --> 01:37:27.917]  Security on any computer system, anywhere in the world, whoever breaches this first essentially wins.
[01:37:27.917 --> 01:37:29.818]  They can hack through everything.
[01:37:29.818 --> 01:37:33.520]  Then the data becomes useful, even more so than it is today.
[01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:43.884]  I mean, to target individuals is fairly easy to do in terms of tracking data, but where we're headed takes it to a level that will allow computers to predict
[01:37:44.404 --> 01:37:47.765]  Things about people that they won't even know about themselves.
[01:37:47.765 --> 01:37:50.826]  I mean, this is where it's headed.
[01:37:50.826 --> 01:37:55.487]  In fact, where it is today is on the threshold of that.
[01:37:55.487 --> 01:38:04.549]  The other is superconductivity, and they've developed some new technologies that are just now coming that will get us room temperature superconductivity.
[01:38:04.549 --> 01:38:05.329]  What does that mean?
[01:38:05.842 --> 01:38:13.929]  That means energy, one of the most important commodities in the world, could be produced anywhere in the world and delivered in a way without line loss.
[01:38:13.929 --> 01:38:21.696]  What that means is you don't need oil pipelines, you can produce energy at the point of production and literally transmit it around the world.
[01:38:21.696 --> 01:38:24.678]  This will change everything about everything.
[01:38:24.678 --> 01:38:28.121]  These two trends in technology will change the world.
[01:38:28.121 --> 01:38:29.723]  At the same time, as the elite
[01:38:30.323 --> 01:38:37.169]  Builds its agenda to strip down humanity into a sub-part of sort of who we are.
[01:38:37.169 --> 01:38:40.911]  We need to recognize what we are as created human beings.
[01:38:40.911 --> 01:38:49.138]  Created in the image of a creator with fundamental power that's been recognized, that's been told to us, that's been predicted for millennia.
[01:38:49.821 --> 01:38:50.962]  And it's here now.
[01:38:50.962 --> 01:38:52.023]  It's here.
[01:38:52.023 --> 01:38:53.404]  I see it emerging.
[01:38:53.404 --> 01:38:56.267]  The countermeasure are an awake public.
[01:38:56.267 --> 01:38:58.949]  It only takes a few to make a huge difference.
[01:38:58.949 --> 01:39:02.792]  And that few is rising into the... Humans built this technocracy.
[01:39:02.792 --> 01:39:03.873]  We can tear it down.
[01:39:03.873 --> 01:39:08.798]  And if the globalists miscalculate and think that they're going to construct something to enslave us...
[01:39:10.475 --> 01:39:12.978]  That's really the test to take us to the next level.
[01:39:12.978 --> 01:39:18.725]  But if you think about that, that's why they're in a race with this quantum computing, trying to break in and control things.
[01:39:18.725 --> 01:39:24.552]  But the group or the country or the people that will actually be immune from it will be those that aren't plugged into any of it.
[01:39:24.552 --> 01:39:27.736]  So we're building our own downfall by putting back doors into everything.
[01:39:29.133 --> 01:39:34.359]  And racing with this AI, talk about the story of Atlantis.
[01:39:34.359 --> 01:39:36.721]  Well, you know, when I think about it.
[01:39:36.721 --> 01:39:40.645]  Whether it's mythical or whatever, the point is you blow up your own, your technology gets so advanced.
[01:39:40.645 --> 01:39:41.926]  Exactly.
[01:39:41.926 --> 01:39:43.969]  Or the Tower of Babel, if you will.
[01:39:43.969 --> 01:39:47.092]  In the same vein, your technology grows to the point where
[01:39:47.892 --> 01:39:52.374]  You literally are a threat to yourself and others, and we've been there a long time.
[01:39:52.374 --> 01:40:00.257]  The issues of personal privacy, I think, are better than the nuclear threats, quite frankly, because they take away the essence of what we are as human beings.
[01:40:00.257 --> 01:40:07.479]  The idea that we're creative, independent, that we have the possibility of doing all of these things that man is trying to create.
[01:40:07.479 --> 01:40:13.242]  Because man, basically, with technology, tries to duplicate what nature already does, what God has already created.
[01:40:13.242 --> 01:40:14.182]  And in the early stages,
[01:40:14.702 --> 01:40:18.109]  The way they've designed the computers is we're being sucked into it like a face sucker.
[01:40:18.109 --> 01:40:19.992]  We're already losing our humanity.
[01:40:19.992 --> 01:40:22.237]  You can see the metrics, IQ, you name it.
[01:40:22.237 --> 01:40:22.377]  Right.
[01:40:23.211 --> 01:40:25.493]  It's already hurting us, so where does this go?
[01:40:25.493 --> 01:40:26.014]  And it is.
[01:40:26.014 --> 01:40:37.645]  And when you look at just sort of the way social media is shaped today, I don't do social media and some say I should, but my reason is it really isn't the way human beings should be interfacing.
[01:40:37.645 --> 01:40:39.347]  It's not the way we should be communicating.
[01:40:39.347 --> 01:40:41.989]  We should be doing it in person and doing it personally.
[01:40:41.989 --> 01:40:44.211]  That's why I'm here in Austin today, is a
[01:40:44.972 --> 01:40:47.073]  I didn't ask you to come do this.
[01:40:47.073 --> 01:40:48.154]  I appreciate it.
[01:41:15.092 --> 01:41:20.397]  Not in a confrontational, angry way, but in an accurate and concise way.
[01:41:20.397 --> 01:41:24.200]  What I see here on the table is a stack of documents.
[01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:27.142]  These aren't something pulled out of the air.
[01:41:27.142 --> 01:41:28.784]  Alex works with the facts.
[01:41:28.784 --> 01:41:32.867]  He has always worked... Well sure, they always accuse us of manufacturing something.
[01:41:32.867 --> 01:41:33.127]  What?
[01:41:33.127 --> 01:41:35.589]  We said they're spying on Trump because they said they were.
[01:41:35.589 --> 01:41:36.570]  Now it's admitted.
[01:41:36.570 --> 01:41:36.971]  Right.
[01:41:36.971 --> 01:41:38.572]  They hate us because we are accurate.
[01:41:38.792 --> 01:41:45.933]  Well, and the reality is every bit of electronic data is retained by government.
[01:41:45.933 --> 01:41:51.274]  Our allies, even the heads of state of our allies, are hacked by our government.
[01:41:51.274 --> 01:42:04.997]  Back in the days when my dad was in the Congress in the early 70s, every congressional office was bugged and monitored by the FBI, and J. Edgar Hoover was blackmailing congressmen as a way of manipulating public policy.
[01:42:04.997 --> 01:42:06.117]  Nothing's changed.
[01:42:06.117 --> 01:42:07.117]  Why do you think that killed your dad?
[01:42:07.944 --> 01:42:09.405]  He was too effective.
[01:42:09.405 --> 01:42:11.246]  He had done... He would stand up against him.
[01:42:11.246 --> 01:42:18.431]  He had done a lot, and he had booted a few of them out of his office in a not very polite way.
[01:42:18.431 --> 01:42:20.413]  My dad was someone that believed in people.
[01:42:20.413 --> 01:42:21.454]  He grew up poor.
[01:42:21.454 --> 01:42:22.774]  He worked his way up.
[01:42:22.774 --> 01:42:31.741]  He was a first-generation American, and I can tell you the values that the Democratic Party once had were lost long ago.
[01:42:31.741 --> 01:42:32.962]  They were for working people.
[01:42:32.962 --> 01:42:34.923]  They were for the average guy, and they're not anymore.
[01:42:34.923 --> 01:42:38.045]  I think that's why Stephen Bannon comes out of working class Democrats.
[01:42:38.045 --> 01:42:42.527]  That's right, and a lot of us... Most of the people actually defeating the Democrats now were Democrats.
[01:42:42.527 --> 01:42:51.571]  That's right, because we recognized the fallacy of the public policy that Democrats were trying to shove down the throats of Americans.
[01:42:51.571 --> 01:42:54.133]  How do you get unions for NAFTA and GATT and TPP?
[01:42:54.932 --> 01:42:58.054]  Well, you know, this is really, you know, again, the big changes.
[01:42:58.054 --> 01:43:05.978]  Now, I worked in the union movement, in the teachers unions in Alaska, and I can tell you, it's not about people in those organizations so much anymore.
[01:43:05.978 --> 01:43:08.800]  There's good people within those organizations.
[01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:10.981]  Excuse me, this is breaking news.
[01:43:10.981 --> 01:43:13.222]  Nick Beggars is with us right now.
[01:43:13.222 --> 01:43:13.522]  U.S.
[01:43:13.522 --> 01:43:17.585]  Senate votes to let Internet providers share your web browsing history without permission.
[01:43:17.585 --> 01:43:18.265]  Print that for me.
[01:43:18.265 --> 01:43:19.646]  I hope that hasn't passed the House yet.
[01:43:21.331 --> 01:43:22.792]  Well, let's find out more.
[01:43:22.792 --> 01:43:24.953]  That just happened today.
[01:43:24.953 --> 01:43:25.574]  Sorry, Dr. Beck.
[01:43:25.574 --> 01:43:27.455]  It should have been exactly what you were just talking about.
[01:43:27.455 --> 01:43:28.336]  This is it.
[01:43:28.336 --> 01:43:30.477]  This is exactly what I'm talking about.
[01:43:30.477 --> 01:43:31.398]  God, talk about now!
[01:43:31.398 --> 01:43:34.260]  You think you erased your browsing history just because it's your private?
[01:43:34.260 --> 01:43:35.541]  And now they always had it.
[01:43:35.541 --> 01:43:36.461]  Now they're going to sell it.
[01:43:36.461 --> 01:43:37.242]  Good God!
[01:43:37.242 --> 01:43:39.003]  And it's really the opposite that should be happening.
[01:43:39.003 --> 01:43:40.164]  You know, the cameras should turn you away.
[01:43:40.164 --> 01:43:41.344]  You know, that's Alphabet.
[01:43:41.344 --> 01:43:42.225]  That's that new thing that...
[01:43:43.746 --> 01:43:46.168]  That Schmidt's running, he says, is the biggest thing.
[01:43:46.168 --> 01:43:47.729]  He thinks they already have quantum computing.
[01:43:47.729 --> 01:43:48.309]  Go ahead.
[01:43:48.309 --> 01:43:49.470]  They may very well.
[01:43:49.470 --> 01:43:50.051]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:43:50.051 --> 01:43:53.533]  And the fact is, the cameras need to turn the other direction.
[01:43:53.533 --> 01:43:55.494]  There should be a camera in every congressional office.
[01:43:55.494 --> 01:43:57.016]  There should be a camera in every government office.
[01:43:57.016 --> 01:43:57.576]  In Schmidt's office!
[01:43:57.576 --> 01:43:59.117]  Because they work for us.
[01:43:59.117 --> 01:44:01.279]  And we ought to have an access to what's going on there.
[01:44:01.279 --> 01:44:06.843]  Schmidt makes his mistresses and girlfriends wear hoods over their heads like Michael Jackson's kids.
[01:44:06.843 --> 01:44:09.284]  He wants his privacy, but then he says, I can't have it.
[01:44:09.284 --> 01:44:10.205]  That's exactly it.
[01:44:10.205 --> 01:44:11.606]  And this is the nature of the elite.
[01:44:12.608 --> 01:44:14.189]  It's the nature of government.
[01:44:14.189 --> 01:44:19.793]  We're supposed to have a transparent government, a government that represents us, and we ought to be able to look in the window and see what it's doing.
[01:44:19.793 --> 01:44:21.133]  And we can't do that.
[01:44:21.133 --> 01:44:23.415]  Instead, the opposite is happening.
[01:44:23.415 --> 01:44:30.659]  The American public, the public, the world's public for that matter, is the most surveyed.
[01:44:30.659 --> 01:44:33.301]  We are a threat because we still think independently.
[01:44:33.841 --> 01:44:41.224]  That's what needs to be maintained, is the independence of thinking, free of the media manipulation that happens every day.
[01:44:41.224 --> 01:44:46.126]  This is what people rejected in this last campaign in the United States.
[01:44:46.126 --> 01:44:47.946]  This is what they rejected in Great Britain.
[01:44:47.946 --> 01:44:52.468]  They rejected the status quo because the status quo is not working.
[01:44:52.648 --> 01:44:53.689]  And isn't it funny?
[01:44:53.689 --> 01:44:55.711]  People thought Trump was going to be pro-NSA.
[01:44:55.711 --> 01:44:58.653]  Now he's the biggest enemy of the surveillance state.
[01:44:58.653 --> 01:45:00.595]  Overnight, it just gets better and better.
[01:45:00.595 --> 01:45:06.400]  Every time I think Trump's wrong on something, then he actually turns around and trolls them.
[01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:08.382]  Trump does some really interesting things.
[01:45:08.382 --> 01:45:13.727]  I don't want to just sit here and grovel about Trump all day, Dr. Begich, but I got to tell you, he is really shaking them up.
[01:45:13.727 --> 01:45:17.590]  They are all over the news saying, kill him, organize a coup, overthrow the government.
[01:45:17.590 --> 01:45:19.151]  They have the former deputy head of defense.
[01:45:20.012 --> 01:45:20.593]  That's illegal!
[01:45:37.995 --> 01:45:41.316]  I've seen folks from these articles come out and go, good, I'll be bigger if Grudge is gone.
[01:45:41.316 --> 01:45:42.096]  Idiots!
[01:45:42.096 --> 01:45:44.077]  I don't mean our audience, but people that don't get it.
[01:45:44.077 --> 01:45:46.437]  If they can shut him down, they can shut us all down.
[01:45:46.437 --> 01:45:51.358]  And the fact of the matter is, we have to be able to tolerate differing opinions.
[01:45:51.358 --> 01:45:53.319]  That's what freedom of the press is about.
[01:45:53.319 --> 01:46:04.682]  That's what this country is about, is the idea that we can debate, that we can invigorate the public debate to the point in which we actually get conclusions that support what the public needs.
[01:46:05.282 --> 01:46:17.425]  What we have is the neutered news, is what I call it, because here we have gone from strong editorial positions on both sides of issues to a news that believes it ought to be neutral, when in fact it never is.
[01:46:17.425 --> 01:46:26.807]  From the time they assigned the reporter to the time that the information is delivered, it's always manipulated to serve those that pay the media's bills.
[01:46:26.807 --> 01:46:28.328]  Where are we historically, then, right now?
[01:46:28.328 --> 01:46:33.789]  I mean, there's a big awakening happening, the elites are pulling all the stops, all these super technologies are coming out, or they're being suppressed.
[01:46:35.509 --> 01:46:46.873]  The term breakaway civilization gets used, but they said they want elite city-states now, where they tax us and control us, but they're exempt within those confines.
[01:46:46.873 --> 01:46:49.333]  That's not Elysium out in space, that's Elysium here on Earth.
[01:46:52.372 --> 01:46:54.693]  This is really what it's about, and the elite already have it.
[01:46:54.693 --> 01:47:00.155]  You know, there's a lot of things people don't recognize about even citizenship within the country.
[01:47:00.155 --> 01:47:05.197]  You know that corporations can go anywhere in the world and redomicile, but you can't.
[01:47:05.197 --> 01:47:08.858]  As an American citizen, without the State Department's permission, you can't even
[01:47:10.168 --> 01:47:11.309]  Quit being an American.
[01:47:11.309 --> 01:47:12.910]  You don't have the right to quit.
[01:47:12.910 --> 01:47:13.891]  You're like a slave!
[01:47:13.891 --> 01:47:21.117]  You are in fact a slave, and in fact, you cannot even, and if you want to leave for tax reasons, that's not allowed.
[01:47:21.117 --> 01:47:22.518]  It's not a permitted reason to leave.
[01:47:22.518 --> 01:47:25.020]  Look it up in the tax code, you'll see it yourself.
[01:47:25.020 --> 01:47:29.923]  You are locked into this place as a taxpayer, whether you like it or not.
[01:47:29.923 --> 01:47:38.050]  But if you're an American corporation, you can dump this place, move to somewhere else, and be perfectly fine, and not pay a nickel here.
[01:47:38.630 --> 01:47:42.213]  Hopefully, we see Trump do what he said, is try and repatriate some of that money.
[01:47:42.213 --> 01:47:42.473]  He's trying.
[01:47:42.473 --> 01:47:42.934]  That's what I mean.
[01:47:42.934 --> 01:47:47.057]  The elites need to stop being such jerks, so greedy, so hateful, so disdainful.
[01:47:47.057 --> 01:47:48.258]  And I know I'm being silly.
[01:47:48.258 --> 01:47:49.619]  A lot of them are very cold-blooded.
[01:47:49.619 --> 01:47:50.480]  That's why we're at this place.
[01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:50.981]  Right.
[01:47:50.981 --> 01:47:55.945]  Don't they instinctively get, if they try to F everybody over, they're gonna get sucked into it?
[01:47:55.945 --> 01:47:58.487]  They don't seem to know everything's interconnected.
[01:47:58.487 --> 01:47:59.508]  That is exactly it.
[01:47:59.508 --> 01:48:00.909]  And in fact, when you look at
[01:48:01.689 --> 01:48:05.550]  What's happening globally in terms of how people are reacting.
[01:48:05.550 --> 01:48:06.651]  It's happening all over.
[01:48:06.651 --> 01:48:09.252]  People are saying whether it's Brazil or England.
[01:48:09.252 --> 01:48:09.892]  That's right.
[01:48:09.892 --> 01:48:14.853]  We're all sick and tired of being used as slaves to support the few.
[01:48:14.853 --> 01:48:19.575]  And when you see the concentration of wealth continuing, you know why there's so many suicides in this country?
[01:48:19.575 --> 01:48:20.755]  They report full employment.
[01:48:20.755 --> 01:48:25.297]  But if you were working in the auto industry making 60 or 65 thousand a year, now you're working at 711 at 15,000 a year.
[01:48:25.297 --> 01:48:26.317]  You don't feel employed.
[01:48:28.678 --> 01:48:30.380]  You can't even pay your bills!
[01:48:30.380 --> 01:48:36.765]  They start taking your cars, taking your kids, taking your house, you're on the street, they blow their heads off!
[01:48:36.765 --> 01:48:38.407]  And this is what's driving it.
[01:48:38.407 --> 01:48:44.212]  You know, the reporting and the way the news is manipulated, the fact of the matter is we are not better off, we're worse off.
[01:48:44.212 --> 01:48:47.855]  It used to be Tradesman could support a family, send his kids to college.
[01:48:48.055 --> 01:48:49.216]  Trump was honest about that.
[01:48:49.216 --> 01:48:50.796]  He said, we're falling apart.
[01:48:50.796 --> 01:48:51.857]  These are fake numbers.
[01:48:51.857 --> 01:48:53.598]  They go, oh, he's a conspiracy theorist.
[01:48:53.598 --> 01:48:59.400]  Everybody's known for 30 years they got fake employment numbers and fake numbers on stuff like inflation.
[01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:00.321]  That's exactly right.
[01:49:00.321 --> 01:49:05.263]  And when you really look at it, just ask the average mother going to the grocery store.
[01:49:05.794 --> 01:49:14.918]  You know, when she had to make a choice between water and milk for her kids because of what has happened in this country and what continues to happen in this country as it's completely undermined.
[01:49:14.918 --> 01:49:15.839]  Just drink the tap water.
[01:49:15.839 --> 01:49:16.839]  It's safe.
[01:49:16.839 --> 01:49:17.879]  Right.
[01:49:17.879 --> 01:49:18.660]  But here we are.
[01:49:18.660 --> 01:49:21.541]  We're in the 21st century and we're walking backwards.
[01:49:21.541 --> 01:49:25.463]  And the only thing that technology has done is improve the entertainment world.
[01:49:25.463 --> 01:49:27.584]  But when we think about the individual lives of people,
[01:49:28.362 --> 01:49:29.363]  We're not any better off.
[01:49:29.363 --> 01:49:36.747]  What's happened is the elite have all created this cosmology of the super future and they'll call us back and, you know, do all this stuff.
[01:49:36.747 --> 01:49:38.988]  But the truth is they see it affects them and their families.
[01:49:38.988 --> 01:49:40.068]  They're not going to get away with this.
[01:49:40.068 --> 01:49:43.911]  They're just going to ruin the planet and just create a giant hell war.
[01:49:43.911 --> 01:49:46.772]  Because I love how they say, we want world government to stop war.
[01:49:46.772 --> 01:49:48.753]  Then they're the ones constantly starting them.
[01:49:48.753 --> 01:49:49.814]  That is exactly right.
[01:49:49.814 --> 01:49:56.457]  And if you look at the nature of it, I mean, America wasn't a country that interfered with everybody's politics 200 years ago.
[01:49:56.457 --> 01:49:57.218]  We were the opposite.
[01:49:57.718 --> 01:49:59.720]  We stayed out of people's politics.
[01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:02.742]  We were supposed to be an example that the rest of the world would follow.
[01:50:02.742 --> 01:50:05.864]  And now we have the policy of imposition.
[01:50:05.864 --> 01:50:06.805]  We don't like what's going on.
[01:50:06.805 --> 01:50:11.989]  I mean, the Russians, if they hacked the DNC, they ought to get a medal for it, in my opinion.
[01:50:11.989 --> 01:50:13.110]  Well, sure.
[01:50:13.110 --> 01:50:14.951]  Trump said, OK, I don't know anything about the Russians.
[01:50:14.951 --> 01:50:15.432]  I'm not involved.
[01:50:15.432 --> 01:50:16.753]  But if you got it, release it.
[01:50:16.753 --> 01:50:19.074]  Because it's criminal emails they're covering up.
[01:50:19.074 --> 01:50:19.595]  That's exactly right.
[01:50:19.595 --> 01:50:20.295]  It doesn't matter.
[01:50:20.295 --> 01:50:21.256]  She had an illegal server.
[01:50:21.256 --> 01:50:22.617]  She let it get grabbed by the Russians.
[01:50:22.617 --> 01:50:23.598]  That's their job.
[01:50:23.598 --> 01:50:24.439]  That's exactly right.
[01:50:24.439 --> 01:50:26.080]  They say we're Russian agents because we say that.
[01:50:26.420 --> 01:50:29.804]  Well, and Hillary had a problem with servers, generally, anyway.
[01:50:29.804 --> 01:50:31.826]  Always smashing them with hammers.
[01:50:31.826 --> 01:50:36.652]  But when you think about all of this, again, it is time for an awakening.
[01:50:36.652 --> 01:50:39.335]  And that awakening is happening now.
[01:50:39.335 --> 01:50:40.236]  And that's what's going to change.
[01:50:40.236 --> 01:50:44.100]  Well, I want you to, in about 10 minutes, get some lunch, but I want to just get you on camera.
[01:50:44.100 --> 01:50:44.621]  Boom!
[01:50:44.621 --> 01:50:45.482]  Dr. Nick Baggett just...
[01:50:47.063 --> 01:50:50.385]  When a storm causes power loss for a whole day, it can seem endless.
[01:50:50.385 --> 01:50:51.966]  There's a new kind of storm brewing.
[01:51:04.392 --> 01:51:09.838]  One that could target our nation's power grid and turn off the power for not just days, but for months or longer.
[01:51:09.838 --> 01:51:13.843]  Veteran news anchor Ted Koppel's new book, Lights Out, details this exact scenario.
[01:51:13.843 --> 01:51:18.168]  And CENTCOM General Lloyd Austin says it's not a question of if, but when.
[01:51:18.168 --> 01:51:25.156]  That's why Americans are rushing to secure solar-powered generators to provide an endless supply of life-saving electricity without gas, fumes, or noise.
[01:51:25.396 --> 01:51:28.760]  And the Breakthrough Patriot Power Generator 1500 has it all.
[01:51:28.760 --> 01:51:30.061]  Portable and lightweight.
[01:51:30.061 --> 01:51:35.767]  Providing up to 1500 continuous watts of clean, quiet and free renewable solar power.

[01:51:48.042 --> 01:51:49.925]  Stay protected with the power you need.

[01:51:59.338 --> 01:52:00.439]  Think about this.
[01:52:00.439 --> 01:52:13.005]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine, and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds, and antidepressants.
[01:52:13.005 --> 01:52:17.047]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.

[01:54:04.335 --> 01:54:06.277]  I was just talking to Dr. Vegas during the break.
[01:54:06.277 --> 01:54:10.440]  Alex Jones here back live broadcasting worldwide from Austin, Texas.
[01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:15.804]  Despite the fact they're openly calling us shut us down, saying we're being investigated for being Russian agents.
[01:54:15.804 --> 01:54:19.167]  They're all over the news saying shut down Drudge Report.
[01:54:19.167 --> 01:54:19.987]  Their U.S.
[01:54:19.987 --> 01:54:25.011]  Senate votes to let internet providers share your web browsing history without permission.
[01:54:25.011 --> 01:54:25.672]  That's the verge.
[01:54:25.672 --> 01:54:28.474]  We'll link that up on Infowars.com.
[01:54:28.474 --> 01:54:30.296]  The media is telling us that Muslims aren't killing us.
[01:54:31.556 --> 01:54:33.177]  It just gets crazier and crazier.
[01:54:33.177 --> 01:54:35.838]  But the good news is, the hoax began to collapse.
[01:54:35.838 --> 01:54:40.960]  Nunes came out, House Intelligence Committee chairman, and said, yeah, they were spying on Trump.
[01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:44.382]  They were in the newspaper saying they were, but I've seen it, they were.
[01:54:44.382 --> 01:54:57.208]  But the arrogance, the attempt of CNN, MSNBC, others, to think that they could, after they admitted they were spying, but nothing was there, turn around and say they never did it and impeach Trump, and now they want to overthrow him, just shows
[01:54:58.823 --> 01:55:05.929]  I don't get why sometimes people that they just are invincibly ignorant, they're on power trips, they don't get what's happening.
[01:55:05.929 --> 01:55:07.831]  But then I was asking, what do you really see for the future?
[01:55:07.831 --> 01:55:08.832]  And you're like, well, this is kind of the...
[01:55:09.656 --> 01:55:15.080]  Getting a big, you know, breath of air before you get in a fight, you think some really nasty stuff's to come, so tell us what you see in the future.
[01:55:15.080 --> 01:55:16.121]  Well, a couple things.
[01:55:16.121 --> 01:55:25.549]  First of all, I think we're going to see the trend in international terrorism increase at a really rapid rate and exponentially from what we're seeing today.
[01:55:25.549 --> 01:55:29.012]  These are just the beginnings of a very... And why did the globalists bring them all in?
[01:55:29.892 --> 01:55:30.633]  And this is it.
[01:55:30.633 --> 01:55:33.534]  It's deconstructing Europe.
[01:55:33.534 --> 01:55:40.618]  It is deconstructing our allies in a way that is totally altering the complexion of those countries.
[01:55:40.618 --> 01:55:46.641]  In fact, over a couple of generations, not even, you're going to see a huge change because of birthrate differences.
[01:55:46.641 --> 01:55:47.141]  It's crazy.
[01:55:47.141 --> 01:55:48.922]  You said this 20 years ago.
[01:55:48.922 --> 01:55:52.224]  Now the head of the UN committee says we want to end Europe.
[01:55:52.224 --> 01:55:54.665]  I mean, it's just total declaration of evil.
[01:55:54.665 --> 01:55:55.166]  Look at this.
[01:55:56.304 --> 01:56:03.752]  And these independent countries are independent because they have cultural differences that don't allow them to fully integrate.
[01:56:03.752 --> 01:56:06.175]  That's why the EU got greedy.
[01:56:06.175 --> 01:56:10.179]  The elite got greedy and started to push the agenda way, way too fast.
[01:56:10.179 --> 01:56:13.162]  And as a consequence, the backlash has begun.
[01:56:13.162 --> 01:56:15.244]  They call it a nationalist backlash.
[01:56:15.244 --> 01:56:15.725]  What's the quote?
[01:56:15.725 --> 01:56:17.707]  You know, the stroke that's too hard many times misses?
[01:56:18.027 --> 01:56:19.148]  That's exactly right.
[01:56:19.148 --> 01:56:24.612]  And so what the public has done is pick up that 2x4 and start beating the government in the head with it.
[01:56:24.612 --> 01:56:26.014]  And it's long overdue.
[01:56:26.014 --> 01:56:28.335]  The fact is, the right is rising now.
[01:56:28.335 --> 01:56:30.357]  In a lot of the countries in Europe, you're not going to see them.
[01:56:30.357 --> 01:56:41.026]  It's going to be in the voting booth that the right is recognized because they're not going to get into the debate, in Germany particularly, where you even speak some of this in your subject to arrest.
[01:56:41.026 --> 01:56:41.986]  It's worse than Russia ever was.
[01:56:41.986 --> 01:56:42.907]  Or they blackball you.
[01:56:42.907 --> 01:56:43.768]  That's exactly right.
[01:56:43.768 --> 01:56:46.310]  They take away your livelihood and they crush you.
[01:56:46.951 --> 01:56:51.898]  If you're trying to report in the media in Germany and you touch these issues, they're going to crush you.
[01:56:51.898 --> 01:56:58.007]  The fact of the matter is, when Germans go in the voting booth, they're going to vote way, way more to the right.
[01:56:58.007 --> 01:57:00.190]  Merkel's already lost three elections, but she's still holding on.
[01:57:00.190 --> 01:57:02.994]  This is parliamentary, and I think there's massive fraud involved.
[01:57:03.494 --> 01:57:09.937]  There's a time when this is going to end, and I think first we're going to see some really rough and difficult times.
[01:57:09.937 --> 01:57:13.298]  I think economically we're at a very difficult place.
[01:57:13.298 --> 01:57:17.480]  The fact that it hasn't collapsed already is really pretty surprising to me.
[01:57:17.480 --> 01:57:27.744]  There are some things, if Trump can deliver on his agenda and get the Congress behind him on the economic platform that he presented, we have a chance of accelerating in the U.S.
[01:57:27.744 --> 01:57:32.346]  while the rest of the world collapses, because it cannot sustain at the current rate.
[01:57:32.346 --> 01:57:32.886]  Well, that's what I see.
[01:57:32.886 --> 01:57:37.447]  I see Trump, as you said, an economic bomb earlier off air, just to really shake people up.
[01:57:37.447 --> 01:57:42.169]  He could be a detour around the really horrible times, but the elite are fighting it, all the rest of it.
[01:57:42.169 --> 01:57:45.650]  So if we don't get this detour, it goes into some really rough territory.
[01:57:45.650 --> 01:57:46.310]  Really rough.
[01:57:46.310 --> 01:57:56.813]  And I think one of the reasons we're attacking the Russians so strongly right now is they did a bunch to try and gut the Russian economy a few years ago when the ruble fell to half.
[01:57:57.233 --> 01:58:05.905]  Well, that's happened in this current generation three different times, and the Russian people rise up out of the dust of that and continue to march on.
[01:58:05.905 --> 01:58:14.257]  Now, if our currency dropped to half its value, we would have rioting in the streets and a complete collapse of this country, because we couldn't sustain it.
[01:58:14.947 --> 01:58:18.408]  So we need to recognize, why are the Russians a threat?
[01:58:18.408 --> 01:58:25.350]  Because they sustain through the worst of times, rise up out of their ashes and start again.
[01:58:25.350 --> 01:58:27.110]  And they're not the evil empire.
[01:58:27.110 --> 01:58:32.391]  Well, that's what the globalists hate, is that they wanted to use Hitler to take them out.
[01:58:32.391 --> 01:58:33.952]  Hitler was set up for that and he failed.
[01:58:33.952 --> 01:58:34.332]  Yep.
[01:58:34.332 --> 01:58:35.872]  And so now they're trying it again.
[01:58:35.872 --> 01:58:36.692]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:36.692 --> 01:58:37.913]  Ladies and gentlemen, stay with us.
[01:58:37.913 --> 01:58:41.874]  Back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:41.874 --> 01:58:43.054]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:44.796 --> 01:58:50.718]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.718 --> 01:58:52.298]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:58:52.298 --> 01:58:57.220]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[01:58:57.220 --> 01:59:00.761]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[01:59:00.761 --> 01:59:06.563]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[01:59:06.563 --> 01:59:12.265]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house.
[01:59:12.685 --> 01:59:15.646]  Like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[01:59:15.646 --> 01:59:21.208]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[01:59:21.208 --> 01:59:28.250]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[01:59:28.250 --> 01:59:32.792]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.
[01:59:33.072 --> 01:59:36.374]  Go to PrivatePowerGrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[01:59:36.374 --> 01:59:38.455]  That's PrivatePowerGrid.com.
[01:59:38.455 --> 01:59:44.177]  Even better, use coupon code PRIVATE at checkout and get a second PPX energy unit for free.
[01:59:44.177 --> 01:59:46.619]  Check it out at PrivatePowerGrid.com.
[01:59:46.619 --> 01:59:52.582]  That's PrivatePowerGrid.com.
[01:59:52.582 --> 01:59:55.223]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:02.799 --> 02:00:06.403]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:00:06.403 --> 02:00:10.547]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:24.184 --> 02:00:30.867]  Well, I tell you, Dr. Nick Begich, I wish you lived here in Austin because we definitely have you hosting a show at least once a week or every day if you wanted to.
[02:00:30.867 --> 02:00:35.349]  I want to work with GCN and others and really launch more broadcasts because there's so much happening.
[02:00:35.349 --> 02:00:39.511]  We need early morning shows, we need stuff at night, not just my broadcast.
[02:00:39.511 --> 02:00:41.372]  But I want you to get some lunch here in a minute.
[02:00:41.372 --> 02:00:45.294]  We've got Dr. Pachinik coming up to talk about all these coups against Trump that are taking place.
[02:00:45.294 --> 02:00:49.176]  But really think about your message to people because you don't really toot your own horn.
[02:00:50.359 --> 02:00:52.060]  And then, hey, I told you it was coming in the past.
[02:00:52.060 --> 02:00:53.261]  Boom, boom, boom.
[02:00:53.261 --> 02:00:54.442]  It's not because I had a crystal ball.
[02:00:54.442 --> 02:00:57.205]  I was studying the actual documents, what's coming in the future.
[02:00:57.205 --> 02:00:59.266]  And really, we are choosing our destiny right now.
[02:00:59.266 --> 02:01:00.607]  Everybody can feel it.
[02:01:00.607 --> 02:01:03.670]  People are either getting more dumb, more unconscious, more zombie-like.
[02:01:03.670 --> 02:01:06.072]  I mean, you go to places like, what the hell's going on here?
[02:01:06.072 --> 02:01:07.813]  These people, brainwaves are low.
[02:01:07.813 --> 02:01:10.115]  You warned about this.
[02:01:10.115 --> 02:01:11.917]  Or people are getting heightened awareness.
[02:01:11.917 --> 02:01:13.998]  And it's not just, like, metaphysical.
[02:01:13.998 --> 02:01:16.821]  They can see it, you know, with the equipment.
[02:01:17.409 --> 02:01:32.066]  Well, you know, and this is exactly it, and it's why I remain this sort of pathological optimist in all of it, because what I see is people are awakening, and those that are taking action are having a big impact at a time when we really need it.
[02:01:32.526 --> 02:01:41.078]  And, you know, when I think about... Abel Danger said the Pentagon's training to take on empowered individuals that will not go along with the collective plan.
[02:01:41.078 --> 02:01:43.822]  The Pentagon's not bad, that's the elite running the Pentagon.
[02:01:43.822 --> 02:01:47.587]  They actually admit empowered individuals, not empowered persons!
[02:01:47.947 --> 02:01:50.549]  And this is, you know, this is who we are as human beings.
[02:01:50.549 --> 02:01:53.592]  We should reach our highest and best potentials.
[02:01:53.592 --> 02:01:56.594]  And that's what all of us should be striving for.
[02:01:56.594 --> 02:01:58.216]  Our highest and best potentials.
[02:01:58.216 --> 02:01:59.717]  That doesn't mean dumbing down.
[02:01:59.717 --> 02:02:02.359]  That means opening up the intellect.
[02:02:02.359 --> 02:02:03.260]  Opening up the possibility.
[02:02:03.260 --> 02:02:04.681]  You're a real man.
[02:02:04.681 --> 02:02:06.903]  You like seeing people excel and having success.
[02:02:06.903 --> 02:02:08.925]  You have glee and shared empathy.
[02:02:08.925 --> 02:02:10.306]  You're connected.
[02:02:10.306 --> 02:02:12.488]  It's these people that are sociopathic and psychopathic.
[02:02:12.488 --> 02:02:13.609]  Is it genetic?
[02:02:13.609 --> 02:02:15.190]  They don't get that we're connected.
[02:02:15.630 --> 02:02:16.611]  Well, and this is it.
[02:02:16.611 --> 02:02:20.674]  You know, the biggest mass murderers in the world are usually your heads of state, right?
[02:02:20.674 --> 02:02:21.355]  Yeah.
[02:02:21.355 --> 02:02:22.856]  That's where it always happens.
[02:02:22.856 --> 02:02:25.719]  Studies show, higher level psychopaths, you know.
[02:02:25.719 --> 02:02:32.004]  This is a personality type, and they become highly controlling, manipulative personality types, and you see the results of that.
[02:02:32.564 --> 02:02:34.725]  Independent thinking is the biggest threat.
[02:02:34.725 --> 02:02:40.949]  Because independent thinking, independent creativity is what has created every significant thing in world history.
[02:02:40.949 --> 02:02:41.809]  All the breakthroughs.
[02:02:41.809 --> 02:02:44.211]  Art, business, politics, religion.
[02:02:44.211 --> 02:02:46.212]  It comes with independent thinking.
[02:02:46.212 --> 02:02:48.733]  And then the evolution... Control freaks never build anything.
[02:02:48.733 --> 02:02:50.154]  They create North Korea.
[02:02:50.154 --> 02:02:52.175]  Free thinkers are just creating, just handing it out.
[02:02:52.515 --> 02:02:57.679]  Right, and you should relish the success of our fellow human beings.
[02:02:57.679 --> 02:03:01.362]  I mean, we're out there doing things and it's creating, creating things.
[02:03:01.362 --> 02:03:03.204]  When I see incredible stuff, I feel like I did it.
[02:03:03.632 --> 02:03:04.452]  Well, it's great.
[02:03:04.452 --> 02:03:05.273]  I mean, it is.
[02:03:05.273 --> 02:03:07.934]  And you can get behind people, you get excited about it.
[02:03:07.934 --> 02:03:10.715]  And that's where the real energy is.
[02:03:10.715 --> 02:03:14.136]  It comes from that type of emotion, not from the... That's the difference.
[02:03:14.136 --> 02:03:17.077]  I mean, I've got to knock... I knock women that are brainwashed so much.
[02:03:17.077 --> 02:03:18.117]  That's the system.
[02:03:18.117 --> 02:03:24.259]  It's men thinking other men being successful is bad and then, like, going around just posturing.
[02:03:24.259 --> 02:03:26.140]  No, we're in a mission for the species.
[02:03:26.420 --> 02:03:27.341]  That's exactly it.
[02:03:27.341 --> 02:03:32.526]  In fact, the human race is the group we all belong to and the group that needs to take the next step.
[02:03:32.526 --> 02:03:40.073]  You know, what I've always said and I continue to say is it doesn't matter if we win every single fight and battle, but it matters that we try.
[02:03:40.073 --> 02:03:42.315]  It matters that we get up in the morning and we make an effort.
[02:03:42.415 --> 02:03:46.736]  And it also matters that when we're wrong, we stand up and we admit it and make the corrections.
[02:03:46.736 --> 02:03:49.257]  Because that's what makes us strong human beings.
[02:03:49.257 --> 02:03:53.338]  You know, we never evolve when things are smooth, when things are easy.
[02:03:53.338 --> 02:03:56.458]  We evolve as human beings when times are the toughest.
[02:03:56.458 --> 02:04:00.800]  And we're going through these interfaces and everything, and cancer exploding and everything.
[02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:02.840]  We're going through a major evolution.
[02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:04.620]  I don't mean that as some debate about Christianity.
[02:04:04.620 --> 02:04:07.101]  I mean cars evolve, cultures evolve, technology evolves.
[02:04:07.101 --> 02:04:09.122]  We are in a major evolutionary period.
[02:04:09.122 --> 02:04:10.442]  A lot of it's devolving.
[02:04:10.862 --> 02:04:11.783]  That's exactly right.
[02:04:11.783 --> 02:04:13.864]  And we have the opportunity to turn it either way.
[02:04:13.864 --> 02:04:15.504]  This generation is going to decide.
[02:04:15.504 --> 02:04:17.485]  Are we free or are we slaves?
[02:04:17.485 --> 02:04:19.787]  We're deciding human evolution right now.
[02:04:19.787 --> 02:04:21.007]  By making the decisions.
[02:04:21.007 --> 02:04:26.090]  Each choice that we make as human beings, each choice we make individually, feeds into that collective.
[02:04:26.090 --> 02:04:30.452]  And everyone knows in their heart, in their mind, that's true.
[02:04:30.452 --> 02:04:31.012]  Absolutely.
[02:04:31.012 --> 02:04:33.013]  In fact, that's what rings so solidly.
[02:04:33.013 --> 02:04:38.056]  When you speak the truth, people hear it, people recognize it, and it resonates within our own individual souls.
[02:04:39.522 --> 02:04:41.163]  Truth is everything.
[02:04:41.163 --> 02:04:43.666]  Dr. Nick Begich, it feels so good having you here in person.
[02:04:43.666 --> 02:04:44.166]  I love you.
[02:04:44.166 --> 02:04:45.347]  Hey, good to be here again.
[02:04:45.347 --> 02:04:46.888]  Folks, the website earthpulse.com.
[02:04:46.888 --> 02:04:48.269]  Get his books, get his films.
[02:04:48.269 --> 02:04:52.753]  I'm going to come back with Dr. Pichanik to expose the latest, and he's going to go shoot some great stuff for us.
[02:04:52.753 --> 02:04:53.674]  Thank you, doc.
[02:04:53.674 --> 02:04:54.294]  Thank you very much.
[02:04:54.294 --> 02:04:54.975]  Thank you for having me.
[02:04:54.975 --> 02:04:55.335]  Amazing.
[02:05:00.137 --> 02:05:03.938]  The health care reform hearing on the Hill today has been a clown act.
[02:05:03.938 --> 02:05:15.402]  You have Democrats taking the podium to passionately complain about the new health care bill, saying it's the worst ever, when it's still government-controlled health care, which is what they cheered for seven years ago, and still today.
[02:05:15.402 --> 02:05:18.163]  I'm beginning to think this was yet another Trump troll.
[02:05:18.163 --> 02:05:26.006]  Make Democrats stop progress of a GOP health care bill that's virtually the same bill they complained the GOP was stopping the progress of.
[02:05:26.006 --> 02:05:27.987]  The epitome of partisan politics.
[02:05:28.547 --> 02:05:34.909]  Democrats are also complaining they haven't seen the bill, but here was Nancy Pelosi when fighting for Obamacare.
[02:05:34.909 --> 02:05:39.930]  But we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it.
[02:05:39.930 --> 02:05:45.391]  She's having hearings today, trying to stop the new health care bill, complaining she hasn't seen it.
[02:05:45.391 --> 02:05:47.832]  What an absolute fraud.
[02:05:47.832 --> 02:05:51.132]  Just chalk this up to more fallout from Obama fail.
[02:05:51.132 --> 02:05:55.473]  Trump is meeting with the House Freedom Caucus today, who could stall the bill in the House.
[02:05:55.473 --> 02:05:57.974]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[02:06:00.171 --> 02:06:02.012]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[02:06:02.012 --> 02:06:08.595]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[02:06:08.595 --> 02:06:11.776]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com.
[02:06:11.776 --> 02:06:21.540]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[02:06:21.540 --> 02:06:22.401]  Caveman.
[02:06:22.401 --> 02:06:27.463]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[02:06:27.463 --> 02:06:29.564]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[02:06:29.864 --> 02:06:33.026]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[02:06:33.026 --> 02:06:38.169]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[02:06:38.169 --> 02:06:46.234]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[02:06:46.234 --> 02:06:54.099]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.

[02:08:10.476 --> 02:08:15.350]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:08:15.350 --> 02:08:16.814]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:08:45.900 --> 02:08:55.004]  Alright, he co-wrote books with Tom Clancy, a Hollywood producer, also one of the founders of Delta Force, involved the State Department and other agencies in counter-terrorism and regime change.
[02:08:55.004 --> 02:08:58.146]  Everybody knows who he is, Dr. Steve Pachenik, stevepachenik.com.
[02:08:58.146 --> 02:09:11.412]  Join us until the bottom of the hour, then I promise I'm getting to all these clips on this confirmation hearings going on, when I gotta say, this judge that's been nominated by Trump's just destroying him.
[02:09:11.412 --> 02:09:13.313]  We've got Nunes admitting to the Intelligence Committee.
[02:09:14.113 --> 02:09:15.414]  Of course they're spying on them.
[02:09:15.414 --> 02:09:17.094]  We have all these sources that are doing it.
[02:09:17.094 --> 02:09:18.755]  I can't believe they're playing dumb with all this.
[02:09:18.755 --> 02:09:22.297]  They were all over the news saying they were, and so much more.
[02:09:22.297 --> 02:09:29.040]  And then the latest Islamic attack, which they're saying isn't an Islamic attack, so we'll see where all that's going.
[02:09:29.040 --> 02:09:33.382]  We have Michael Moore again calling for martial law and a national emergency.
[02:09:33.382 --> 02:09:40.645]  You have the former deputy head of the Defense Department, this is in the Washington Post, going around again trying to organize a coup against Trump.
[02:09:40.645 --> 02:09:42.165]  Here's the deal.
[02:09:42.165 --> 02:09:43.326]  I'm Mr. Anti-Police State.
[02:09:44.838 --> 02:09:51.682]  The police state means if I'm not doing something wrong, I'm getting messed with, I'm getting surveilled, I'm getting bothered, and I'm out here producing stuff being a good American.
[02:09:51.682 --> 02:10:09.591]  When you run around saying, kill the president, let's burn everything down, let's shut Alex Jones up, he's a Russian agent, they're actually saying I'm under criminal investigation, and this thing he set up, the State Department before Obama left, that's going to ferret things out that they're looking at if I'm in connection with the Russians and actually getting orders from them.
[02:10:09.591 --> 02:10:12.373]  The idea that nationalism came from the Russians is crazy.
[02:10:13.288 --> 02:10:18.271]  And now we have the Federal Elections Commission saying we're looking at trying to go after Drudge Report.
[02:10:18.271 --> 02:10:20.052]  They're acting like Trump didn't get elected.
[02:10:20.052 --> 02:10:23.173]  Now, I've talked a lot about this with Dr. Pachenik.
[02:10:23.173 --> 02:10:25.995]  And yes, this was regime change against the globalists.
[02:10:25.995 --> 02:10:28.176]  It's happening all over the world.
[02:10:28.176 --> 02:10:31.318]  But they don't seem to care, and they're just moving forward.
[02:10:32.614 --> 02:10:41.279]  It is a big crack in their brainwashing that, you know, Nunes comes out and says, of course they're spying, but they were in hundreds of articles in the New York Times and Washington Post saying they were spying two months ago.
[02:10:41.279 --> 02:10:45.501]  But there was nothing in the spying, so Trump said, you shouldn't have leaked you were spying.
[02:10:45.501 --> 02:10:48.463]  So then they go, we weren't spying, we're going to impeach you.
[02:10:48.463 --> 02:10:54.486]  You know, our guest is also a Harvard-educated psychiatrist and a lot more.
[02:10:54.486 --> 02:10:59.448]  I know there's a term, gaslighting, where you punch somebody right in the nose and tell them you didn't punch them in the nose.
[02:11:01.749 --> 02:11:04.229]  I don't think they're even in control of what they're doing anymore.
[02:11:04.229 --> 02:11:08.850]  I think they're the ones doing like some type of metaphysical ghost dance.
[02:11:08.850 --> 02:11:13.111]  You know, the Democrats, the corrupt elites, not realizing that no one's listening to them anymore.
[02:11:13.111 --> 02:11:22.913]  But the danger is they've still got major funding and they believe they're moving forward to an attempt to, they say, kill the president.
[02:11:22.913 --> 02:11:27.894]  So my question is, under law, you can't just sit there and ignore somebody
[02:11:29.173 --> 02:11:35.802]  The President was saying opening the borders, trying to steal people's tax money, trying to, you know, merge us with China.
[02:11:35.802 --> 02:11:39.086]  I'd say, well, somebody better do something, because the President is clearly not the President.
[02:11:39.086 --> 02:11:46.856]  But to take a President who's delivering on every front, has the majority of people behind him, has the military, most of the intelligence agencies behind him, and then to
[02:11:48.115 --> 02:11:54.199]  Just keep drum beating that they're going to arrest me, everybody else, kill us.
[02:11:54.199 --> 02:11:56.240]  I'm wondering, do these people have a death wish?
[02:11:56.240 --> 02:12:07.768]  Because I'm not going to do anything violent, but I can just tell you, the way this goes down the road, if they actually start an attempt to kill the president, little birds told me that Trump is ready to move against them.
[02:12:07.768 --> 02:12:11.210]  So I don't know how this may unfold, or maybe it's all just talk.
[02:12:11.210 --> 02:12:15.053]  Dr. Steve Pucinich, thanks for joining us to try to give us your take or your sources on what's happening.
[02:12:15.922 --> 02:12:20.569]  Well, let's go back a few years, Alex.
[02:12:20.569 --> 02:12:25.576]  Years ago, I told you I was asked if I could be monitored from above.
[02:12:26.477 --> 02:12:27.798]  And I said, of course.
[02:12:27.798 --> 02:12:29.179]  I have no problem with it.
[02:12:29.179 --> 02:12:31.440]  You guys have been monitoring me for years.
[02:12:31.440 --> 02:12:33.081]  You didn't have to announce it.
[02:12:33.081 --> 02:12:34.181]  But I have no problem.
[02:12:34.181 --> 02:12:35.762]  I understand why you're doing it.
[02:12:35.762 --> 02:12:37.523]  I have no issue with it.
[02:12:37.523 --> 02:12:39.684]  You're not going to repress my speech.
[02:12:39.684 --> 02:12:44.387]  Nor are you going to repress or suppress Alex Jones' speech or anybody else's speech.
[02:12:44.387 --> 02:12:50.850]  Let's get some historical facts and perspective before everybody starts to go and become unfolded here.
[02:12:50.850 --> 02:12:52.211]  And I'm not talking about you, Alex.
[02:12:53.118 --> 02:13:07.685]  First of all, the notion of suppressing and surveying American speech goes back to the times of FDR, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the absolute greatest liberal president we've had, and a great president.
[02:13:07.685 --> 02:13:19.090]  He was told by both Congress and the Supreme Court, you cannot survey in any way the electronic emissions or signal intelligence that comes from the American public, i.e.
[02:13:19.090 --> 02:13:20.711]  the telephones or anything else.
[02:13:21.587 --> 02:13:30.610]  He said, yes, yes, but he and ran all of them and basically had a covert surveillance of every American.
[02:13:30.610 --> 02:13:38.832]  And at the same time, this great liberal incarcerated American Germans, American Italians and American Japanese.
[02:13:38.832 --> 02:13:44.854]  So the history of surveillance in this country goes back to the time of FDR.
[02:13:44.854 --> 02:13:48.415]  It increased when the National Security Agency came in in 1948, 49.
[02:13:50.825 --> 02:13:57.947]  A bill was passed and every American telephone wire literally went through the National Security Agency.
[02:13:57.947 --> 02:14:05.829]  So to think that we have not been surveyed or in any way monitored is absolutely both childish and absurd.
[02:14:05.829 --> 02:14:10.630]  And of course we got our model from the OSS, the British that were doing it in real time as well.
[02:14:11.121 --> 02:14:11.822]  That's correct.
[02:14:11.822 --> 02:14:22.373]  I mean, in effect, we were in World War II, and then there was the Cold War, and rightfully or wrongfully, this was in place because this was the way you took care of the Republic.
[02:14:22.373 --> 02:14:25.297]  But to be clear, they didn't sit there and listen to everybody.
[02:14:25.297 --> 02:14:26.738]  All the wires went through.
[02:14:26.738 --> 02:14:30.002]  Once they had HUMET that somebody was a German agent or something, then they started watching him.
[02:14:30.731 --> 02:14:31.612]  Right, that's correct.
[02:14:31.612 --> 02:14:39.056]  In other words, but they had this surveillance capability which was not sanctioned by the Supreme Court or the Congress.
[02:14:39.056 --> 02:14:47.941]  Sure, so we have this outside of the Constitution system, and for them to deny it's going on when they said they were surveilling Trump with it, it's just crazy.
[02:14:47.941 --> 02:14:48.962]  Well, and that's okay.
[02:14:48.962 --> 02:14:55.005]  What we're falling into again, and with all due respect, Alex, this is distraction and denial.
[02:14:55.005 --> 02:14:59.428]  The real issues that are coming to the forefront is, once again, we have
[02:14:59.813 --> 02:15:01.294]  The neocons coming in.
[02:15:01.294 --> 02:15:02.575]  And what am I talking about?
[02:15:02.575 --> 02:15:06.899]  Right now, in front of the Judiciary Committee, is Neil Gorsuch.
[02:15:06.899 --> 02:15:17.528]  A very decent man, who looks like he's been perfect, his moral integrity seems above board, went to Harvard, summa cum laude, and then had a PhD at Oxford.
[02:15:18.049 --> 02:15:23.534]  But then when I closely look at his record, I have a major, major problem with it.
[02:15:23.534 --> 02:15:38.646]  In a 14-month period during the time of 2005 when he worked directly for Attorney General Gonzalez, he, Gorsuch, initiated and enhanced several programs which were totally illegal and immoral.
[02:15:38.646 --> 02:15:45.752]  First was the enhancement of interrogation, secondly was rendition, thirdly was torture.
[02:15:45.752 --> 02:15:46.153]  He was
[02:15:47.213 --> 02:15:54.496]  Key to the torture, implementation, and legitimacy of using torture against so-called terrorists.
[02:15:54.496 --> 02:15:57.257]  Now remember, this comes after 9-11.
[02:15:57.257 --> 02:15:58.597]  So what do we have here?
[02:15:58.597 --> 02:16:05.239]  We have a so-called decent Coloradan who tells you about how humble he is, but really he's quite bright.
[02:16:05.239 --> 02:16:11.161]  And at the same time, he goes to Georgetown Preparatory School, which happens to be a Jesuit school.
[02:16:11.161 --> 02:16:15.443]  I have nothing against Jesuits, but clearly he learns how to follow orders.
[02:16:16.061 --> 02:16:24.343]  And in this case, I must say, Dianne Feinstein, as much as I don't agree with her most of the time, was correct to press in on the key issue.
[02:16:24.343 --> 02:16:30.724]  Because the moral integrity of Neil Gorsuch does not lie in 48 years of his life.
[02:16:30.724 --> 02:16:42.226]  It lies in the 14 months that he was a co-conspirator with Bush, Cheney, and Wolfowitz, and Condoleezza Rice and Rummy to implement Patriots Act,
[02:16:42.876 --> 02:16:46.279]  Increased terrorism and increased interrogation.
[02:16:46.279 --> 02:16:49.221]  That makes him an amoral man.
[02:16:49.221 --> 02:16:55.926]  From that point on, I have a question that this man cannot be a judge in the Supreme Court.
[02:16:55.926 --> 02:16:57.908]  Now, what is in fact happening?
[02:16:57.908 --> 02:17:04.693]  While you and I are talking about other issues, I'm still monitoring the rise and fall of the neocons.
[02:17:04.693 --> 02:17:10.357]  As you know, we were successful in stopping John Bolton from coming in as a key player in the State Department.
[02:17:10.357 --> 02:17:12.259]  Yet today, he went into the White House.
[02:17:12.819 --> 02:17:27.293]  Whether Trump realizes this or not, or he understands what I'm saying, or a group of us who are saying, we're not dilettantes, we're not somebody who has an axe to grind, but there will be no neocons in the White House or in the State Department.
[02:17:27.293 --> 02:17:30.576]  Let me repeat it again, so Trump and his team understands this.
[02:17:31.232 --> 02:17:32.992]  And Tillerson understands this.
[02:17:32.992 --> 02:17:34.533]  I don't care who you are.
[02:17:34.533 --> 02:17:39.653]  I don't care if you're the CEO of a $500 billion corporation like Mogollon.
[02:17:39.653 --> 02:17:55.076]  You do not threaten North Korea under any condition because you have a moron like John Bolton, who's never been in the military, who was afraid to join our military and publicly said, I was scared to get killed in the rice paddies of Vietnam.
[02:17:55.076 --> 02:17:57.697]  So breaking this down, though, what do you make of the Democrats?
[02:17:57.697 --> 02:17:58.257]  That's my question.
[02:17:58.257 --> 02:17:59.757]  You get to what you want in a minute, but I'm asking
[02:18:00.938 --> 02:18:06.183]  I get it's a distraction, but they're literally running around saying kill the president and they're not getting in trouble.
[02:18:06.183 --> 02:18:07.785]  Alex, they're not relevant.
[02:18:07.785 --> 02:18:09.927]  Right now the Democrats are not relevant.
[02:18:09.927 --> 02:18:16.274]  The only thing they're relevant to do, and I'm going back to this point, they cannot have neoconservatives coming in.
[02:18:16.274 --> 02:18:21.139]  You can't have... So you're saying the neocons are the dangerous group and Trump can't appease them?
[02:18:22.180 --> 02:18:24.081]  Diane Feinstein is not dangerous.
[02:18:24.081 --> 02:18:25.922]  Nancy Pelosi is not dangerous.
[02:18:25.922 --> 02:18:27.523]  Michael Moore is not dangerous.
[02:18:27.523 --> 02:18:29.304]  They've all been neutralized.
[02:18:29.304 --> 02:18:44.275]  What happened is thanks to you and the group and those of us who kept the revolution going, the neocons who've been cowards and deprecated you, me and Trump, snuck back in like a bunch of rats and they're back in the White House.
[02:18:44.275 --> 02:18:45.716]  And instead of focusing
[02:18:46.078 --> 02:18:55.004]  On the neoconservative rise, which leads with Gorsuch, Bolton, Abrams, all of whom have no right to come back into the administration.
[02:18:55.004 --> 02:18:56.365]  They were cowards.
[02:18:56.365 --> 02:18:57.966]  They were people who... Let me ask you this.
[02:18:57.966 --> 02:18:59.247]  I mean, I understand that.
[02:18:59.247 --> 02:19:01.068]  What do the neocons want?
[02:19:01.068 --> 02:19:05.992]  And then looking at what's happening with Korea, what's going on with China and the South China Sea?
[02:19:05.992 --> 02:19:07.153]  Alex, listen to me.
[02:19:07.153 --> 02:19:09.094]  I know you don't like it right now.
[02:19:09.094 --> 02:19:10.415]  We're not on the same wavelength.
[02:19:11.755 --> 02:19:15.264]  The neocons want America to go to war.
[02:19:15.264 --> 02:19:16.386]  No, I don't want to go to war.
[02:19:16.386 --> 02:19:17.629]  It's not that I disagree with you.
[02:19:17.629 --> 02:19:19.253]  I'm trying to get you on the subject I'm asking.
[02:19:19.253 --> 02:19:20.476]  Go ahead.
[02:19:20.476 --> 02:19:20.877]  Excuse me.
[02:19:21.860 --> 02:19:28.721]  North Korea has 2.2 million men on the DMZ, on the Demilitarized Zone.
[02:19:28.721 --> 02:19:31.862]  We are 30 miles away from Seoul.
[02:19:31.862 --> 02:19:38.943]  If John Bolton has his way, he'd have no problem taking preemptive action, whatever that means, because he's never been in the military.
[02:19:38.943 --> 02:19:41.024]  He has no strategy or tactics.
[02:19:41.024 --> 02:19:47.585]  And 2.2 million North Koreans will swarm over the DMZ and literally go in hours right into Seoul.
[02:19:47.625 --> 02:20:02.430]  Well sure, so the only action is, if they try to load atomics on the missiles, if you want to go to war, is you've got to preemptively nuke North Korea, their capital, you've got to hit that whole DMZ line, and then tell China, everybody else, ultimatum, if you try something, Trump's got to deal with Russia, we're going to joint nuke China.
[02:20:02.430 --> 02:20:05.151]  And then I guess they'd pop up their submarines and nuke the West Coast.
[02:20:05.151 --> 02:20:10.113]  Alex, remember, I've been in the business of nuclear deterrence, we took it down, we have the Soviet Union.
[02:20:10.113 --> 02:20:13.034]  No, I know, but I mean, that's the public attack plan.
[02:20:13.034 --> 02:20:16.195]  Do you think North Korea will actually take that bluff with this guy running it?
[02:20:17.023 --> 02:20:20.024]  I don't... North Korea is not interested in a bluff.
[02:20:20.024 --> 02:20:23.225]  North Korea couldn't care less about a sanction.
[02:20:23.225 --> 02:20:26.625]  What North Korea will do is what's best for North Korea.
[02:20:26.625 --> 02:20:33.647]  Our preparation has to do with the tactical and strategic issues of how to deal with North Korea with other countries.
[02:20:33.647 --> 02:20:35.208]  That's what Bolton... No, I understand.
[02:20:35.208 --> 02:20:35.888]  You like Trump.
[02:20:35.888 --> 02:20:36.568]  You're glad he's in.
[02:20:36.568 --> 02:20:38.588]  You're upset to see neocons coming around.
[02:20:38.588 --> 02:20:40.829]  And you don't think the neocons have learned any lessons?
[02:20:42.663 --> 02:20:44.265]  They've been destructive to the country.
[02:20:44.265 --> 02:20:44.885]  What have we done?
[02:20:44.885 --> 02:20:45.866]  No, I'm not defending them.
[02:20:45.866 --> 02:20:47.267]  I can't stand the neocons.
[02:20:47.267 --> 02:20:49.409]  Okay, well then what does Trump need to do?
[02:20:49.409 --> 02:20:56.476]  We're not addressing the issue of why, in fact, we're repeating what we had under the Bush-Cheney administration and in the Obama administration.
[02:20:56.476 --> 02:20:58.198]  Okay, well why do neocons keep taking over then?
[02:20:58.666 --> 02:21:05.534]  Because they're there and they're able to be incredibly, you know, like snakes or like rats.
[02:21:05.534 --> 02:21:06.455]  They're on the ship.
[02:21:06.455 --> 02:21:08.136]  I'm not around in Washington.
[02:21:08.136 --> 02:21:09.958]  You're not around in Washington.
[02:21:09.958 --> 02:21:12.701]  They're able to co-op the conservative party.
[02:21:12.701 --> 02:21:17.006]  They're funded by Shelly Adelson or they're funded by the Mercers or whoever it is.
[02:21:17.006 --> 02:21:18.428]  What they do is they tell Trump.
[02:21:19.028 --> 02:21:24.690]  And his weaker people will be nice just as soon as Trump lets us run things.
[02:21:24.690 --> 02:21:29.071]  But then every time he lets them in, they leak information that they are a group of rats.
[02:21:29.071 --> 02:21:32.793]  Perlman and all these people are just like crazy.
[02:21:32.793 --> 02:21:39.355]  I mean, like you know about Perlman, Prince of Darkness, he like showed up at cocktail parties in the news and said, I kill lots of people, I'm manly.
[02:21:39.355 --> 02:21:44.877]  And then women run from him as if women want a guy to walk up and go, I'm a murderer, I kill people.
[02:21:44.877 --> 02:21:45.657]  That's not what women want.
[02:21:46.608 --> 02:21:53.351]  I mean, it's like he's totally, you look at, how did a little pasty guy who looks like a raccoon get in control of things?
[02:21:53.351 --> 02:22:01.555]  I mean, how does Bolton with that big ridiculous mustache, you're acting like I'm defending the Neocons, I hate the Neocons, looks like he's like a, you know, like a big brush at the... That's exactly what they do.
[02:22:01.555 --> 02:22:08.258]  They basically, they scurry away when it comes for time to come forth and do something that's morally right.
[02:22:08.798 --> 02:22:10.099]  They didn't support you.
[02:22:10.099 --> 02:22:12.480]  They didn't go after their own president.
[02:22:12.480 --> 02:22:13.760]  They weren't able to resign.
[02:22:13.760 --> 02:22:14.401]  What are you talking about?
[02:22:14.401 --> 02:22:17.682]  They came after me with all their publications and tried to stop Trump.
[02:22:17.682 --> 02:22:18.903]  I'm not talking about that.
[02:22:18.903 --> 02:22:20.603]  I'm not talking about their publications.
[02:22:20.603 --> 02:22:23.445]  I'm talking about that they didn't go after the president of the United States.
[02:22:23.445 --> 02:22:23.965]  No, I agree.
[02:22:23.965 --> 02:22:26.346]  Why is he going to let people in that were his enemies in the campaign?
[02:22:27.045 --> 02:22:29.626]  Because he has no other alternative.
[02:22:29.626 --> 02:22:31.066]  I don't know why he's choosing them.
[02:22:31.066 --> 02:22:31.806]  I'll tell you why.
[02:22:31.806 --> 02:22:34.867]  Because at every level, no one will appoint who he says.
[02:22:34.867 --> 02:22:37.568]  Everyone ignores his orders and says, yes sir, yes sir, yes sir.
[02:22:37.568 --> 02:22:39.568]  And he can't get anybody in.
[02:22:39.568 --> 02:22:40.489]  There's a total mutiny.
[02:22:40.489 --> 02:22:41.609]  That's what I'm telling you.
[02:22:41.609 --> 02:22:45.970]  He's got that State Department office running operations against him, saying everybody's a Russian agent.
[02:22:45.970 --> 02:22:49.091]  Well, what do you think of this claim that I'm getting directed by the GD Russians?
[02:22:49.875 --> 02:22:50.736]  Well, it's absurd.
[02:22:50.736 --> 02:22:57.239]  You and I know that the Russians could care less, although they like you very much, and they happen to like me or fear me.
[02:22:57.239 --> 02:22:58.340]  It's not relevant.
[02:22:58.340 --> 02:23:04.504]  The fact that the Russians happen to be monitoring everybody, we're monitoring the Israelis.
[02:23:04.504 --> 02:23:06.145]  Yeah, whoever gave them all these superpowers.
[02:23:06.974 --> 02:23:08.915]  But that's exactly what happens.
[02:23:08.915 --> 02:23:17.541]  What I'm getting to again, we're getting into the self-destructive force where we got into that problem with Bush Cheney.
[02:23:17.541 --> 02:23:21.003]  Trump has now congratulated Cheney for his support.
[02:23:21.003 --> 02:23:26.807]  And what we're getting is a president who we wanted up there and does not have judicious advice.
[02:23:26.807 --> 02:23:27.928]  Well, I'll agree with you on this.
[02:23:27.928 --> 02:23:31.891]  He did great on the jobs, great on the economy, great on his moves for the average person.
[02:23:31.891 --> 02:23:32.711]  Light years better than Hillary.
[02:23:32.711 --> 02:23:33.252]  Here's the problem.
[02:23:33.892 --> 02:23:34.553]  That's correct.
[02:23:34.553 --> 02:23:36.996]  And what he needs are people like you or the people like myself who've been
[02:23:51.440 --> 02:23:57.427]  Involved, and we're able to come out and able to take risks and able to create things.
[02:23:57.427 --> 02:24:02.172]  There's not one neocon who's ever served our country or built his own corporation.
[02:24:02.172 --> 02:24:06.777]  What I'm getting at is we're getting into self- Well, let's tell folks who neocons are because they hear me say this.
[02:24:06.777 --> 02:24:09.459]  You can pull it up in the Washington Post, New York Times, 10 years ago.
[02:24:09.459 --> 02:24:10.360]  They were Trotskyites.
[02:24:10.360 --> 02:24:10.681]  Explain it.
[02:24:11.254 --> 02:24:21.287]  Yeah, the neocons were created by Commentary Magazine, a man by the name of John Podorec, who's the father-in-law of Elliot Abrams.
[02:24:21.287 --> 02:24:27.394]  It happens to be, unfortunately, a great amount of Jews who were Trotskyites and avowed communists.
[02:24:27.394 --> 02:24:29.237]  The only thing they really understood
[02:24:29.761 --> 02:24:35.547]  Was that we had to have revolution at every point in the progression of history.
[02:24:35.547 --> 02:24:37.049]  They were not pro-Americans.
[02:24:37.049 --> 02:24:38.611]  They avoided the draft.
[02:24:38.611 --> 02:24:41.314]  They were very cowardly when it came to the draft.
[02:24:41.314 --> 02:24:47.140]  Then at the time when... Of course, they won't call that anti-Semitic because you, of course, have a Jewish background as well.
[02:24:47.140 --> 02:24:48.081]  I'm just telling you.
[02:24:48.081 --> 02:24:50.524]  But it's not debated that the neocons are Jewish Trotskyites.
[02:24:51.055 --> 02:24:52.536]  Yeah, they're Jewish Trotskyites.
[02:24:52.536 --> 02:24:55.639]  I mean, there's Zalmay Khalilzad, who's from Afghanistan.
[02:24:55.639 --> 02:24:57.661]  There's Steve Hadley, who's Christian.
[02:24:57.661 --> 02:24:59.003]  I mean, I can go down the whole list.
[02:24:59.003 --> 02:25:00.164]  Yeah, there's a lot of Christian Zionists.
[02:25:00.164 --> 02:25:01.285]  And I'm not against Israel.
[02:25:01.285 --> 02:25:03.447]  My point is, what's wrong with the neocons?
[02:25:03.447 --> 02:25:07.411]  Because secretly, it keeps coming out, they're allied with radical Islam.
[02:25:07.411 --> 02:25:08.572]  They're allied with Saudi Arabia.
[02:25:08.572 --> 02:25:09.573]  That's my big issue with them.
[02:25:09.853 --> 02:25:21.565]  The Neocons 1 is a constant state of war and a military-industrial complex where the United States makes certain that Israel be the focal point in the Middle East.
[02:25:21.565 --> 02:25:22.806]  That didn't work.
[02:25:22.806 --> 02:25:27.651]  Where we would get rid of Saddam Hussein in Iraq, that didn't work.
[02:25:27.651 --> 02:25:29.172]  Sure, I know you're giving us the background.
[02:25:29.172 --> 02:25:29.553]  Here's the deal.
[02:25:29.873 --> 02:25:32.677]  Hundreds of publications are saying what I said two months ago.
[02:25:32.677 --> 02:25:37.484]  There is a soft coup operation or a coup as the nation calls it against Trump.
[02:25:37.484 --> 02:25:38.866]  They're just ignoring him.
[02:25:38.866 --> 02:25:43.092]  And I guess he thinks bringing these people in, they can get stuff done.
[02:25:43.092 --> 02:25:45.055]  Well, that's just letting them take over the highest post.
[02:25:45.055 --> 02:25:45.656]  So what do we do?
[02:25:46.465 --> 02:25:51.290]  Well, what we did is, unfortunately, I have to kind of step back a bit.
[02:25:51.290 --> 02:25:56.715]  We put in Michael Flynn, who was able to, in many ways, get rid of some of those neocons.
[02:25:56.715 --> 02:26:07.525]  But unfortunately, I have generals in the Secretary of Defense position, McMaster, elsewhere, who've accepted the notion that we can put soldiers into harm's way when we have no strategy.
[02:26:08.049 --> 02:26:09.911]  We have no strategy in Syria.
[02:26:09.911 --> 02:26:11.633]  We have no strategy in Iraq.
[02:26:11.633 --> 02:26:13.555]  And once again, we're in Afghanistan.
[02:26:13.555 --> 02:26:15.236]  This is the 15th year.
[02:26:15.236 --> 02:26:20.902]  This is what the neocon... Is it the strategy threatening to overthrow Saudi Arabia if they don't pull out their forces?
[02:26:20.902 --> 02:26:22.464]  The overthrowing Saudi Arabia?
[02:26:22.464 --> 02:26:25.327]  Saudi Arabia is part of the funding of the neocon narrative.
[02:26:25.327 --> 02:26:26.448]  That's what I just said.
[02:26:26.448 --> 02:26:31.153]  So if you want to shut down ISIS, you threaten to overthrow Saudi Arabia, ISIS will go home overnight.
[02:26:31.793 --> 02:26:38.516]  I can go through the CIA right now and get you the people who created them, plus the men who were involved, plus the Mossad out there.
[02:26:38.516 --> 02:26:40.917]  Okay, well then how do you shut down ISIS?
[02:26:40.917 --> 02:26:41.618]  It's easy!
[02:26:41.618 --> 02:26:44.119]  You reverse-engineer how you created it.
[02:26:44.119 --> 02:26:46.100]  That was created by al-Qaeda and ISIS.
[02:26:46.100 --> 02:26:47.961]  It was created by the CIA.
[02:26:47.961 --> 02:26:48.261]  I know.
[02:26:49.096 --> 02:26:49.937]  I go to Tenet.
[02:26:49.937 --> 02:26:51.979]  I go to the guys who created it.
[02:26:51.979 --> 02:26:53.641]  I do the interrogation.
[02:26:53.641 --> 02:26:55.583]  Then I find out who was involved.
[02:26:55.583 --> 02:27:01.389]  I'll find out where the money track comes from in Saudi Arabia and Israel, Jordan, UAE and Dubai.
[02:27:01.389 --> 02:27:02.490]  It's not hard.
[02:27:02.490 --> 02:27:06.495]  You don't fight an enemy that you don't need to fight and was created by us.
[02:27:06.795 --> 02:27:07.335]  No, I agree.
[02:27:07.335 --> 02:27:10.677]  So, so, I mean, couldn't you put pressure on Saudi Arabia and Qatar and others?
[02:27:10.677 --> 02:27:11.478]  Pressure?
[02:27:11.478 --> 02:27:12.518]  That's all nonsense.
[02:27:12.518 --> 02:27:17.601]  The pressure doesn't mean anything, because Saudi Arabia is literally like our cousin.
[02:27:17.601 --> 02:27:18.902]  They can't get close enough.
[02:27:18.902 --> 02:27:20.083]  They're fearful of us.
[02:27:20.083 --> 02:27:21.924]  If you want to get... No, I agree!
[02:27:21.924 --> 02:27:23.865]  So, as you're saying, don't tell Saudi.
[02:27:23.865 --> 02:27:29.048]  Our own shadow government's still backing al-Nusra, al-Qaeda, ISIS, and Trump doesn't know how to do it.
[02:27:29.824 --> 02:27:47.471]  You don't go overseas when you can go home and I can go right through the CIA and pull out every person who was involved, go right through the Saudi intelligence, go through Mossad, and I can get you every person involved in the neocons and 9-11 and put them on trial.
[02:27:47.471 --> 02:27:49.031]  That's not what's happening.
[02:27:49.031 --> 02:27:56.494]  In fact, what's happening is a repetition of the failures that occurred from 9-11 onward, and Trump now will be
[02:27:57.094 --> 02:27:59.055]  Involved with that very issue.
[02:27:59.055 --> 02:28:00.716]  I don't care about Jared Kushner.
[02:28:00.716 --> 02:28:02.396]  He doesn't know what he's doing.
[02:28:02.396 --> 02:28:02.776]  I don't care.
[02:28:02.776 --> 02:28:02.976]  I know.
[02:28:02.976 --> 02:28:05.678]  Another thing is, Kushner, he's a good-looking guy, everything.
[02:28:05.678 --> 02:28:07.218]  His own family gave him the money.
[02:28:07.218 --> 02:28:12.500]  What is this young guy in these meetings with Trump in every different meeting like he's the boss?
[02:28:12.500 --> 02:28:20.524]  Well, the problem is Trump has to have somebody around him with whom he feels secure, whether it's Ivanka or Jared Kushner.
[02:28:20.524 --> 02:28:21.404]  He likes his family.
[02:28:22.145 --> 02:28:23.105]  That's his family.
[02:28:23.105 --> 02:28:24.366]  That's not my problem.
[02:28:24.366 --> 02:28:30.947]  My problem is that Jared- But as a psychiatrist, what does that say about Trump that he always wants family around?
[02:28:30.947 --> 02:28:35.829]  Let's say, on the nicer edge, I can say he loves his family.
[02:28:35.829 --> 02:28:43.851]  On a more sophisticated level, I would say he needs those who he feels comfortable with in order to give himself a kind of
[02:28:44.668 --> 02:28:47.671]  Psychological barrier to deal with strangers.
[02:28:47.671 --> 02:28:48.652]  Is that unusual?
[02:28:48.652 --> 02:28:48.692]  No.
[02:28:55.046 --> 02:28:58.488]  John F. Kennedy had it with RFK.
[02:28:58.488 --> 02:29:01.049]  You know, I don't want to get into the psychiatry of the man.
[02:29:01.049 --> 02:29:02.130]  I understand the man.
[02:29:02.130 --> 02:29:03.770]  The problem isn't understanding him.
[02:29:03.770 --> 02:29:06.432]  The problem is the action that's initiated.
[02:29:06.432 --> 02:29:10.534]  Well, he's overcome his... I'm not going to get into it.
[02:29:10.534 --> 02:29:11.374]  You know what, Doc?
[02:29:11.374 --> 02:29:12.915]  Doc, I'm not arguing with you today.
[02:29:12.915 --> 02:29:15.716]  I just, look, I just know Hillary would destroy the country.
[02:29:15.716 --> 02:29:16.937]  I know Trump's not perfect.
[02:29:16.937 --> 02:29:18.718]  I see him kind of sliding back a little bit.
[02:29:19.498 --> 02:29:20.839]  Which I expected him to do.
[02:29:20.839 --> 02:29:24.460]  He's already gotten heroic stuff done, but I agree with you.
[02:29:24.460 --> 02:29:27.662]  All these neocons that want to start all these wars, it's just insane.
[02:29:27.662 --> 02:29:29.643]  Let's start with one at a time.
[02:29:29.643 --> 02:29:32.664]  Gorsuch cannot be nominated for Supreme Court justice.
[02:29:32.664 --> 02:29:34.465]  But he seems like a pretty conservative guy.
[02:29:34.465 --> 02:29:36.406]  No, he's not a conservative.
[02:29:36.406 --> 02:29:37.186]  All right, let's come back.
[02:29:37.186 --> 02:29:41.728]  I've got a bunch of clips I've got to get to, but do a few minutes, if you can, on why you think the new Supreme Court guy's bad.
[02:29:41.728 --> 02:29:46.010]  And then I'm going to move to clips and more ahead of the next host that joins us.
[02:29:46.010 --> 02:29:48.431]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with Steve McChinney.
[02:29:49.107 --> 02:29:52.128]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.128 --> 02:30:00.131]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.131 --> 02:30:04.612]  WikiLeaks continues to expose the nightmarish surveillance state in which we currently live.
[02:30:04.612 --> 02:30:14.616]  As the Vault 7 leaks continue, we learn more about how the surveillance grid works, and how governments use it to spy on interesting people, or how a hacker could get access to virtually anything.
[02:30:14.616 --> 02:30:18.117]  Now WikiLeaks has released Dark Matter, the latest leak in the Vault 7 collection.
[02:30:18.257 --> 02:30:25.359]  Dark Matter claims the CIA has been bugging cell phones right out of the factory since 2008, which is right when smartphones began to take over the market.
[02:30:25.359 --> 02:30:32.202]  This comes at the hands of the Embedded Development Branch, who develop software that is ingrained into cell phones' firmware, making it there permanently.
[02:30:32.202 --> 02:30:39.044]  Combine that with all the terms and conditions we blindly agree to with every new app we download, a cell phone is a government portal to your life.
[02:30:39.044 --> 02:30:47.767]  Other such CIA operations and technologies such as Dark Sea Skies, Night Skies 1.2, Sonic Screwdriver, and more will be included in the latest release.
[02:30:47.987 --> 02:30:50.692]  All of which seem to directly target Apple products.
[02:30:50.692 --> 02:30:55.402]  More we'll be breaking from Wikileaks today on Dark Matter, including a live stream of Julian Assange.
[02:30:55.402 --> 02:30:57.806]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[02:30:57.806 --> 02:30:59.509]  Be careful with that government probe droid.
[02:31:00.237 --> 02:31:02.518]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[02:31:02.518 --> 02:31:04.099]  It's like lightning in a bottle.
[02:31:04.099 --> 02:31:07.980]  We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform at the level we'd like to.

[02:31:59.997 --> 02:32:01.838]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[02:32:01.838 --> 02:32:08.441]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[02:32:08.441 --> 02:32:11.603]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com.
[02:32:11.603 --> 02:32:21.387]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[02:32:21.387 --> 02:32:22.228]  Caveman.
[02:32:22.228 --> 02:32:27.290]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[02:32:27.290 --> 02:32:29.411]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[02:32:29.711 --> 02:32:32.852]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[02:32:32.852 --> 02:32:37.993]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[02:32:37.993 --> 02:32:46.015]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[02:32:46.015 --> 02:32:54.078]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[02:32:54.078 --> 02:32:57.599]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself.
[02:32:57.599 --> 02:32:58.739]  InfoWarsLive.com today.
[02:33:17.226 --> 02:33:22.128]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[02:33:22.128 --> 02:33:28.129]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:28.129 --> 02:33:31.210]  People ask why I like having country.
[02:33:32.170 --> 02:33:34.692]  Well, it's a culture, it's ideas, it's some rules.
[02:33:34.692 --> 02:33:36.933]  Doesn't mean they always get followed, doesn't mean it's perfect.
[02:33:36.933 --> 02:33:37.633]  Globalism?
[02:33:37.633 --> 02:33:43.397]  Bunch of multinational Mark Zuckerbergs and Eric Schmitz running around playing God?
[02:33:43.397 --> 02:33:45.098]  That's a nightmare.
[02:33:45.098 --> 02:33:53.783]  But when you talk about the neocons, almost none of them were ever in the military, they always want wars, they're always talking about nuclear war would be survivable, let's have it.
[02:33:53.783 --> 02:33:56.525]  It really is a crazy mindset.
[02:33:56.525 --> 02:33:58.466]  And so I get what Dr. Steve Pachinick's talking about here.
[02:34:00.373 --> 02:34:04.756]  And I see this new Supreme Court Justice, I think about if Hillary was in, who would we be getting?
[02:34:04.756 --> 02:34:07.998]  So just be clear, why are you saying there's issues with this guy?
[02:34:07.998 --> 02:34:10.059]  Let me put it this way.
[02:34:10.059 --> 02:34:16.444]  For many of the people in the audience, I would love them to see a film called Judgment at Nuremberg.
[02:34:16.444 --> 02:34:21.107]  But the Nuremberg trials were exactly about Judge Gorsuch.
[02:34:21.107 --> 02:34:23.068]  The question was asked by our
[02:34:23.666 --> 02:34:43.338]  Prosecutors after the war, why were German Nazi judges who were very sane and normal and had huge degrees from America, Britain and Germany, able to initiate laws that were against the Jews, gays, whatever, and they were suppressed.
[02:34:44.108 --> 02:34:57.158]  And why would these decent people, and this judge is an extremely decent individual, but during a 14-month period, he cracked his decency and literally began to go into the fascist state.
[02:34:57.158 --> 02:35:08.907]  He thought it was good to initiate a suppression of freedom, a surveillance of what our normal freedoms are, increased enhanced torture, he justified it.
[02:35:09.287 --> 02:35:12.896]  Went to Guantanamo, said this was the best thing he could have had.
[02:35:12.896 --> 02:35:15.182]  He wrote to the Council on Foreign Relations.
[02:35:15.182 --> 02:35:16.666]  Remember, I was there and then I left.
[02:35:17.093 --> 02:35:20.896]  That we should have a policy discussion on the need for torture?
[02:35:20.896 --> 02:35:35.226]  And so what happened during these 14 months was to reveal the underlying nature of this so-called decent American, who was not unlike many of the German judges, who were decent German judges, but they followed orders.
[02:35:35.226 --> 02:35:38.708]  And the orders were to suppress American freedoms.
[02:35:38.708 --> 02:35:39.729]  He should have said no.
[02:35:40.464 --> 02:35:45.489]  I'm a lawyer, but at this point, morality supersedes my job as a lawyer.
[02:35:45.489 --> 02:35:46.750]  He couldn't do that.
[02:35:46.750 --> 02:35:48.331]  And he didn't want to do that.
[02:35:48.331 --> 02:35:53.836]  And instead, he became this slimy, egregious individual, but very smooth.
[02:35:54.522 --> 02:36:10.526]  He had all the credentials he needed and worked his way through the conservative channels, through the Heritage Foundation, through the Federalist Foundation, until he looked as if he was cleaner than Macbeth's wife, when in fact, he was already morally compromised.
[02:36:10.526 --> 02:36:17.368]  When a man or a person is morally compromised, I don't care if they've been justified for 99 years, at that point, 99.1 years, they have a problem.
[02:36:21.089 --> 02:36:23.613]  Well let's back off of that for a minute and just look at Trump.
[02:36:23.613 --> 02:36:25.636]  He has an authoritarian stripe down his back.
[02:36:25.636 --> 02:36:27.859]  The elite don't like him because he's not working with them.
[02:36:27.859 --> 02:36:28.861]  He's trying to empower the people.
[02:36:28.861 --> 02:36:30.063]  So I like Trump.
[02:36:30.063 --> 02:36:32.687]  But there is that stripe of authoritarianism.
[02:36:33.345 --> 02:36:36.788]  Yeah, but Trump has never suppressed anybody's freedom.
[02:36:36.788 --> 02:36:39.030]  Trump has never invoked... No, no, I agree.
[02:36:39.030 --> 02:36:40.851]  But you're saying this guy has.
[02:36:40.851 --> 02:36:52.141]  This guy was not only suppressing, he was number three at the Justice Department, couldn't be better off, and couldn't thank Bush enough, Jr., that he was rewarded with a 10th Circuit Court
[02:36:52.541 --> 02:36:52.981]  We're good.
[02:37:16.047 --> 02:37:25.112]  Trying to top off the topping on the cake, he went to Oxford and wrote some nonsensical thesis about why you don't have euthanasia and assisted suicide.
[02:37:25.112 --> 02:37:30.255]  This guy smells and reeks of the ability to slime his way up the political ladder.
[02:37:30.255 --> 02:37:34.577]  But at the moment of truth, at least with Cheney, I knew what Cheney was.
[02:37:34.577 --> 02:37:35.477]  He was a rat.
[02:37:35.477 --> 02:37:39.119]  He was a rat from day one, and he was a rat from day five.
[02:37:39.119 --> 02:37:41.200]  But he never changed his stripes.
[02:37:41.200 --> 02:37:44.382]  This guy, Gorsuch, was changing his stripes right and left.
[02:37:44.744 --> 02:37:49.270]  And then stood on a self-righteous step and said, what, me?
[02:37:49.270 --> 02:37:50.211]  I haven't done anything.
[02:37:50.211 --> 02:37:51.573]  I was just a lawyer.
[02:37:51.573 --> 02:37:53.396]  No, you were more than a lawyer.
[02:37:53.396 --> 02:37:58.202]  You were the perpetrator and the instigator and the facilitator of suppression of the state.
[02:37:58.202 --> 02:37:59.283]  That's called fascism.
[02:37:59.904 --> 02:38:04.368]  If it's fascism for a day, a week, or a year, that's still fascism.
[02:38:04.368 --> 02:38:08.511]  For that reason alone, he does not deserve to be Supreme Court Justice.
[02:38:08.511 --> 02:38:16.377]  There are many other conservative judges who... Well, if I was going to get confirmed... I mean, look, I understand the stuff with Eleanor Bush, the guy who followed orders, whatever.
[02:38:16.377 --> 02:38:18.439]  I mean, I get what you're saying.
[02:38:18.439 --> 02:38:21.181]  My issue is, can you imagine what Hillary was going to do if she got in with these judges?
[02:38:21.181 --> 02:38:22.241]  I'm not worried about Hillary.
[02:38:22.241 --> 02:38:23.402]  We're not talking about Hillary.
[02:38:23.402 --> 02:38:24.803]  Hillary's off on another planet.
[02:38:24.803 --> 02:38:25.564]  No, I understand.
[02:38:25.564 --> 02:38:26.265]  We're moving forward.
[02:38:26.265 --> 02:38:27.806]  We can't look at the past and judge things by that.
[02:38:28.626 --> 02:38:33.168]  I can't put back in there the people who created the problems to begin with.
[02:38:33.168 --> 02:38:35.049]  You and I started... Sure, I'm almost out of time.
[02:38:35.049 --> 02:38:37.150]  Let me shift yours back to Nunes.
[02:38:37.150 --> 02:38:39.712]  Yeah, you know, he's standing up and saying, yeah, they're spying on Trump.
[02:38:39.712 --> 02:38:42.073]  That's a good thing.
[02:38:42.073 --> 02:38:45.154]  It's not a... Of course he's... I told you 10 years ago.
[02:38:45.154 --> 02:38:46.555]  No, we know, we know.
[02:38:46.555 --> 02:38:50.917]  So what does it mean that the media would run this whole hoax that Trump's not being spied on?
[02:38:51.590 --> 02:38:53.433]  It's again a distraction.
[02:38:53.433 --> 02:38:54.775]  I'm going back to you a hundred times.
[02:38:54.775 --> 02:38:55.396]  Yeah, but here's the thing.
[02:38:55.396 --> 02:38:56.238]  You're a smart guy.
[02:38:56.238 --> 02:39:02.548]  Don't blind yourself just because you know this that the public needs to know when they're up there saying we're liars, there's no surveillance.
[02:39:02.548 --> 02:39:03.270]  We have to expose it.
[02:39:03.669 --> 02:39:04.590]  Well, I just said it.
[02:39:04.590 --> 02:39:05.871]  We have surveillance.
[02:39:05.871 --> 02:39:17.158]  But the key issue is the public doesn't know we've got 500 Marines being put into Syria in a war that can't be won, in a battle that was not even planned out correctly in Raqqa.
[02:39:17.158 --> 02:39:19.780]  We have another- But I mean, Trump promised to knock them out.
[02:39:19.780 --> 02:39:21.021]  You don't think they can kill those guys?
[02:39:21.960 --> 02:39:22.941]  He can't kill them.
[02:39:22.941 --> 02:39:25.823]  You don't kill so-called terrorists.
[02:39:25.823 --> 02:39:26.363]  No, I get it.
[02:39:26.363 --> 02:39:27.905]  You turn off their command and control.
[02:39:27.905 --> 02:39:30.687]  You're saying the command and control is still inside the U.S.
[02:39:30.687 --> 02:39:31.487]  government.
[02:39:31.487 --> 02:39:32.969]  So what is Trump doing 60 seconds?
[02:39:40.758 --> 02:39:42.379]  I'm sorry Alex, what's going on?
[02:39:42.379 --> 02:39:44.160]  No, I mean I just asked a question.
[02:39:44.160 --> 02:39:45.140]  What does Trump do then?
[02:39:45.140 --> 02:39:48.001]  You're saying you don't militarily beat him, what do you do?
[02:39:48.001 --> 02:39:59.567]  As generals, instead of having a meeting of 62 countries to find out how you go with ISIS, you sit down with McMaster, who knows better than this, and ask what the internal strategy is for taking apart
[02:40:00.100 --> 02:40:06.447]  The ISIS and how it came about through the Mossad, through... No, I know, and who the leadership is and all that.
[02:40:06.447 --> 02:40:07.608]  So here's the question.
[02:40:07.608 --> 02:40:09.229]  Does Trump just get advice from his people?
[02:40:09.229 --> 02:40:11.392]  The generals follow orders and don't tell him stuff?
[02:40:12.093 --> 02:40:13.894]  No, the generals give him the order.
[02:40:13.894 --> 02:40:15.694]  They tell him exactly what he wants to hear.
[02:40:15.694 --> 02:40:17.895]  He's not a strategist.
[02:40:17.895 --> 02:40:19.495]  He's never been in combat.
[02:40:19.495 --> 02:40:27.298]  No, no, Trump tells, I know for a fact, Trump tells the commanders, the CIA, the Defense Department, all of them, he says, what's the best plan?
[02:40:27.298 --> 02:40:27.938]  He listens to them.
[02:40:27.938 --> 02:40:29.099]  He says, do it.
[02:40:29.099 --> 02:40:31.239]  Trump actually says, just do it.
[02:40:31.239 --> 02:40:32.760]  So the claim that he's not, you know.
[02:40:33.840 --> 02:40:39.823]  But I'm trying to tell you, Alex, the generals have failed in doing what they're supposed to do.
[02:40:39.823 --> 02:40:41.644]  And the reason is very simple.
[02:40:41.644 --> 02:40:44.206]  They were there in the first Iraq war, they failed.
[02:40:44.206 --> 02:40:45.947]  In the second Iraq war, they failed.
[02:40:45.947 --> 02:40:47.468]  They haven't won a war.
[02:40:47.468 --> 02:40:49.409]  They've been in battles, but not wars.
[02:40:49.409 --> 02:40:52.911]  So they're ready to fight wars and aren't ready to use intelligence to cut it off at the head.
[02:40:53.703 --> 02:40:56.344]  You got it.
[02:40:56.344 --> 02:41:01.427]  The basic premise of all wars is you win it by using the head, not by using guns.
[02:41:01.427 --> 02:41:01.687]  I got it.
[02:41:01.687 --> 02:41:06.450]  If you put guns on the ground, particularly with the Marines, you've got cannon fodder.
[02:41:06.450 --> 02:41:08.911]  I've got boys who just came back from Africa.
[02:41:08.911 --> 02:41:10.892]  They don't know what they were doing in Africa.
[02:41:10.892 --> 02:41:13.493]  They don't know why they were shooting at certain people.
[02:41:13.493 --> 02:41:15.734]  They don't know why we have troops in eastern Africa.
[02:41:15.734 --> 02:41:16.135]  No, I know.
[02:41:16.135 --> 02:41:17.055]  I understand.
[02:41:17.055 --> 02:41:20.157]  So you're saying it is literally just a defense contractor
[02:41:21.446 --> 02:41:23.947]  It's the Philippine Industrial Complex again.
[02:41:23.947 --> 02:41:31.028]  We don't need $58 billion more and in a budget that's already blowed it to $600 billion.
[02:41:31.028 --> 02:41:33.508]  I have 888 generals and admirals.
[02:41:33.508 --> 02:41:35.949]  Twice the amount I had in World War II.
[02:41:35.949 --> 02:41:42.350]  Yet in World War II, I won two wars with George Marshall and Eisenhower and we never had as many generals.
[02:41:47.169 --> 02:41:48.510]  There we go.
[02:41:48.510 --> 02:41:50.752]  Interesting insight into all of this.
[02:41:50.752 --> 02:41:52.133]  Let's talk about Nunes, though.
[02:41:52.133 --> 02:41:55.356]  House Intel Chair confirms Obama administration surveilled Trump.
[02:41:55.356 --> 02:41:57.017]  That's a longer clip from C-SPAN.
[02:41:57.017 --> 02:41:59.199]  If you want to play the first clip, Nunes.
[02:41:59.199 --> 02:42:04.403]  Incidental collection, unmasking, widely disseminated.
[02:42:04.403 --> 02:42:08.706]  Well, see their argument is Trump wasn't the target.
[02:42:08.706 --> 02:42:12.529]  It was his building and his phone numbers and his staff.
[02:42:12.529 --> 02:42:14.571]  That's playing lawyer games again, folks.
[02:42:15.768 --> 02:42:19.271]  And Pacino's right, it's a distraction.
[02:42:19.271 --> 02:42:28.658]  But if we tell you they're going to call for overthrowing Trump in a civil emergency and martial law, and three months later it comes true, we have to point it out because they're saying we're the fake news.
[02:42:28.658 --> 02:42:35.123]  If we point out Trump was being surveilled, we told you exactly how, studying the law, and then it again comes out we're right.
[02:42:35.123 --> 02:42:38.805]  We have to do it because it's not just about the regular audience that's already awake.
[02:42:38.805 --> 02:42:41.307]  God love you, you're the key at everything.
[02:42:41.307 --> 02:42:43.229]  We're trying to reach the people.
[02:42:43.229 --> 02:42:44.590]  It's the prodigal son story in the Bible.
[02:42:47.267 --> 02:42:50.688]  The younger son says, I want my inheritance.
[02:42:50.688 --> 02:42:53.348]  And the father says, hey, everything's great here at our ranch or farm.
[02:42:53.348 --> 02:42:54.769]  He goes, I want it.
[02:42:54.769 --> 02:42:55.769]  He goes, OK.
[02:42:55.769 --> 02:43:00.210]  He runs off for like five years, drunk, partying, prostitutes, blows it all.
[02:43:00.210 --> 02:43:03.030]  Comes back, the older brother's like, I've been a good steward.
[02:43:03.030 --> 02:43:03.831]  What the hell?
[02:43:03.831 --> 02:43:04.771]  You're having a party?
[02:43:04.771 --> 02:43:11.532]  That the prodigal son just came back?
[02:43:11.532 --> 02:43:14.973]  The father looks at him and he goes, this is your brother.
[02:43:17.247 --> 02:43:19.269]  Can you imagine what it would be like if it was you?
[02:43:19.269 --> 02:43:20.310]  You're strong.
[02:43:20.310 --> 02:43:21.852]  I don't expect you to do that.
[02:43:21.852 --> 02:43:24.054]  This is still our family.
[02:43:24.054 --> 02:43:31.521]  And, you know, that's where I'm coming at this.
[02:43:31.521 --> 02:43:32.663]  We can't just sit here...
[02:43:34.304 --> 02:43:36.465]  And get pissed at everybody in the government all day long.
[02:43:36.465 --> 02:43:37.685]  I used to do it too.
[02:43:37.685 --> 02:43:39.626]  You know, the TSA are all pedophiles.
[02:43:39.626 --> 02:43:42.788]  I mean, I didn't say that, but... And then I realized, they're just... I met them.
[02:43:42.788 --> 02:43:44.769]  They're like listeners and people that were part of the Border Patrol.
[02:43:44.769 --> 02:43:46.189]  They put them in there and they just want a job.
[02:43:46.189 --> 02:43:47.590]  They don't want to do this.
[02:43:47.590 --> 02:43:50.191]  They know there's real terrorists, but they think it's all crap.
[02:43:50.191 --> 02:43:51.752]  I'm not blaming them.
[02:43:51.752 --> 02:43:52.992]  It's a cop-out.
[02:43:52.992 --> 02:43:54.033]  It's the Congress.
[02:43:54.033 --> 02:43:57.114]  It's the government that leaves the border open, that lets the people in.
[02:43:57.114 --> 02:44:01.636]  Trump's doing something about that.
[02:44:01.636 --> 02:44:01.896]  And so...
[02:44:04.673 --> 02:44:07.876]  You look at Nunes and say, oh really, tell us something we didn't know.
[02:44:07.876 --> 02:44:11.119]  You know all this.
[02:44:11.119 --> 02:44:13.601]  So I'm not giving you attention.
[02:44:13.601 --> 02:44:14.882]  I don't expect attention to me.
[02:44:14.882 --> 02:44:15.983]  You call up and say how great I am.
[02:44:15.983 --> 02:44:18.465]  Listen, our country's got its legs cut off, bleed to death.
[02:44:18.465 --> 02:44:20.587]  Great, I'm great, because I don't want to die.
[02:44:20.587 --> 02:44:23.749]  And I'm not bitching that you thank me.
[02:44:23.749 --> 02:44:25.451]  It's just like, I don't deserve it.
[02:44:25.451 --> 02:44:26.612]  This is self-preservance.
[02:44:29.929 --> 02:44:31.969]  The prodigal son is who we want.
[02:44:31.969 --> 02:44:35.370]  We want the people who aren't totally turned over to lie.
[02:44:35.370 --> 02:44:37.551]  We want to reach out to them.
[02:44:37.551 --> 02:44:40.291]  So we have to point out, see?
[02:44:40.291 --> 02:44:43.632]  The government says you don't have a memory.
[02:44:43.632 --> 02:44:45.452]  Jonathan Gruber says you're dumb.
[02:44:45.452 --> 02:44:46.952]  I don't think you're dumb.
[02:44:46.952 --> 02:44:52.874]  If you start using your memory and get connected to God, you can live.
[02:44:52.874 --> 02:44:55.394]  I don't talk slow to be mean.
[02:44:55.394 --> 02:44:58.395]  That's how I've got to talk to you, like NPR.
[02:45:01.448 --> 02:45:07.270]  Trump talks to people like it's real slow.
[02:45:07.270 --> 02:45:12.472]  And it's not because he doesn't know that you don't already know it.
[02:45:12.472 --> 02:45:16.193]  He's not going after you.
[02:45:16.193 --> 02:45:22.195]  He's going after people that are unconscious and are in a sleep state.
[02:45:22.195 --> 02:45:23.396]  Sleep.
[02:45:23.396 --> 02:45:24.376]  Sleep.
[02:45:24.376 --> 02:45:26.037]  Come out of the sleep.
[02:45:27.415 --> 02:45:28.857]  I've never been scientific about all this.
[02:45:28.857 --> 02:45:33.601]  Now that I'm 43, I've been doing this for 20-something years and see what's been effective telling the truth.
[02:45:33.601 --> 02:45:36.384]  I understand more now.
[02:45:36.384 --> 02:45:40.448]  So if a cynic's all frustrated because he's all up there knowing how stuff works, been involved with stuff, you know, he's the real deal.
[02:45:40.448 --> 02:45:42.230]  He's been involved with a lot of things.
[02:45:42.230 --> 02:45:48.437]  He's all pissed because he's wanting to communicate with the government structure and get them to stop.
[02:45:49.076 --> 02:45:49.816]  And that's fine.
[02:45:49.816 --> 02:45:51.537]  I communicate with them too.
[02:45:51.537 --> 02:45:55.658]  I'm communicating with the people, because at the end of the day, that's where their power comes from.
[02:45:55.658 --> 02:46:00.699]  I mean, I'm not saying Pacino's wrong about stuff, but, you know, six, seven years ago, it was like, we need a revolution now, violent, let's do it.
[02:46:00.699 --> 02:46:03.560]  I'm like, no, you watch, it's cultural, we're going to win.
[02:46:03.560 --> 02:46:07.041]  They want a violent overthrow because they think they can defeat that.
[02:46:07.041 --> 02:46:09.242]  We're going to be peaceful until they attack us.
[02:46:09.242 --> 02:46:15.604]  And then, I don't take any pleasure if it's physical people, like killing dumbasses that work for the globalists.
[02:46:18.746 --> 02:46:25.129]  That's like some dumb dog running off its back porch trying to bite you because you're walking down the alley, you know.
[02:46:25.129 --> 02:46:26.870]  You got to kick the dog outside the head.
[02:46:26.870 --> 02:46:27.670]  It keeps coming at you.
[02:46:27.670 --> 02:46:35.173]  You just kind of go, I'm sorry, and take up an old pole or something on the side of the alley and beat his brains out.
[02:46:35.173 --> 02:46:37.214]  There's a dog all bleeding to death right there.
[02:46:37.214 --> 02:46:38.515]  And you're just like, yeah, that sucks, man.
[02:46:38.515 --> 02:46:40.576]  I wouldn't do that.
[02:46:40.576 --> 02:46:41.356]  It's the same deal.
[02:46:41.356 --> 02:46:43.857]  I don't want to kill anybody.
[02:46:43.857 --> 02:46:46.198]  Informationally, it's how we operate.
[02:46:46.198 --> 02:46:47.579]  And we've had big effects all over the world.
[02:46:47.579 --> 02:46:48.159]  You can see that.
[02:46:53.953 --> 02:46:59.195]  But people sit there and they look at people like Nunes and they say, oh my God, he's telling us this is happening.
[02:46:59.195 --> 02:47:01.736]  Why do we got to explain to the public surveillance is happening?
[02:47:01.736 --> 02:47:03.536]  They should already know it.
[02:47:03.536 --> 02:47:05.397]  They've been brainwashed.
[02:47:05.397 --> 02:47:06.997]  You can't have the same elitist attitude.
[02:47:06.997 --> 02:47:08.898]  You've got to reach out to them and get them out of it.
[02:47:10.148 --> 02:47:13.609]  There's the clip, known as Incidental Collapsure, because it's incidental.
[02:47:13.609 --> 02:47:19.352]  Oh, we were totally surveilling you, and then people illegally went into the incidental group gathering.
[02:47:19.352 --> 02:47:20.252]  They gather everything.
[02:47:20.252 --> 02:47:23.513]  You're supposed to have a warrant to get to the specific when you've got cause.
[02:47:23.513 --> 02:47:26.015]  They ignore that warrant.
[02:47:26.015 --> 02:47:32.157]  And then they just give the Democratic Party, totally illegally, all this stuff to look at, and there's nothing there.
[02:47:32.157 --> 02:47:33.878]  Trump calls them, so they spin it.
[02:47:33.878 --> 02:47:35.198]  Trump has trolled them again.
[02:47:35.198 --> 02:47:38.160]  So, gotta hand it to Trump.
[02:47:38.160 --> 02:47:38.680]  Time will tell.
[02:47:39.778 --> 02:47:43.142]  I'm still 95% with Trump.
[02:47:43.142 --> 02:47:45.984]  I expect it to be 80% and still supporting him at this point.
[02:47:45.984 --> 02:47:47.986]  I will see how it works out.
[02:47:47.986 --> 02:47:59.698]  Maybe I'll be more against or more for as we see how his calculus works.
[02:47:59.698 --> 02:48:00.459]  All right, here's Nunes.
[02:48:00.459 --> 02:48:00.780]  Here it is.
[02:48:01.966 --> 02:48:08.671]  So first, I recently confirmed that on numerous occasions, the intelligence community incidentally collected information about U.S.
[02:48:08.671 --> 02:48:12.193]  citizens involved in the Trump transition.
[02:48:12.193 --> 02:48:13.274]  Details about U.S.
[02:48:13.274 --> 02:48:25.402]  persons associated with the incoming administration, details with little or no apparent foreign intelligence value, were widely disseminated in intelligence community reporting.
[02:48:26.946 --> 02:48:34.333]  Third, I have confirmed that additional names of Trump transition team members were unmasked.
[02:48:34.333 --> 02:48:44.783]  And fourth, and finally, I want to be clear, none of this surveillance was related to Russia or the investigation of Russian activities or of the Trump team.
[02:48:47.585 --> 02:48:50.566]  Now, Nunes knows everything about this.
[02:48:50.566 --> 02:48:52.406]  And I don't know enough about Nunes.
[02:48:52.406 --> 02:48:55.207]  He's got some good voting records, some bad voting records.
[02:48:55.207 --> 02:48:58.588]  I just, out of all the people, he's not a coward.
[02:48:58.588 --> 02:49:00.849]  Because they're now threatening to try to remove him.
[02:49:00.849 --> 02:49:02.610]  They're saying he's a Russian agent.
[02:49:02.610 --> 02:49:10.592]  They're coming after him because he's the one guy in that whole pantheon of cowards, other than Rand Paul, coming out and saying it's ridiculous.
[02:49:10.592 --> 02:49:13.273]  And he was called an agent of Putin.
[02:49:13.273 --> 02:49:13.933]  You work for Putin.
[02:49:15.353 --> 02:49:18.015]  They look at people like Elijah Cummings.
[02:49:18.015 --> 02:49:21.777]  I mean, you know, give me a break, man.
[02:49:21.777 --> 02:49:26.560]  The Democratic Party has been so controlled by the Russians during the Cold War that it's a joke.
[02:49:26.560 --> 02:49:34.785]  And then you've got the nerve to look at people like Nunes, who's just telling the truth and say he's an evil person?
[02:49:34.785 --> 02:49:37.546]  So I'm not in some butt-kissing event for Nunes.
[02:49:37.546 --> 02:49:39.328]  I just recognize courage.
[02:49:39.328 --> 02:49:44.571]  And believe me, Nunes is putting his life in his hands because they think the intelligence community is so cowardly
[02:49:45.922 --> 02:49:51.547]  That they won't come out and state the obvious that Trump was under surveillance when they all admitted they were earlier.
[02:49:51.547 --> 02:50:00.755]  Again, they were arrogant.
[02:50:00.755 --> 02:50:02.536]  Across the board, anybody.
[02:50:02.536 --> 02:50:05.118]  We had that CIA guy on, I want to get on again.
[02:50:05.118 --> 02:50:05.499]  Johnson.
[02:50:06.673 --> 02:50:10.956]  Former head analyst for a whole section of the CIA, former Fox analyst.
[02:50:10.956 --> 02:50:14.778]  And they have these whole articles out, he's full of crap, he doesn't have sources, there was surveillance.
[02:50:14.778 --> 02:50:16.799]  It's all admitted in the law!
[02:50:16.799 --> 02:50:19.581]  That the incoming president, everything's recorded.
[02:50:19.581 --> 02:50:22.703]  They, again, I keep saying it because it proves they're liars.
[02:50:22.703 --> 02:50:27.146]  So, somebody like Pchenik says, just ignore it, it's diversion and distraction.
[02:50:27.146 --> 02:50:32.109]  I get it, but see, Pchenik, I'm going after the prodigal son.
[02:50:33.866 --> 02:50:40.969]  I know people that were raised right, very color and creed, understand this is BS.
[02:50:40.969 --> 02:50:45.831]  I'm not trying to get them Pachinic, I already have them.
[02:50:45.831 --> 02:50:49.513]  I want the prodigal son.
[02:50:49.513 --> 02:50:52.234]  I don't like seeing anybody fall to this brainwashing.
[02:50:52.234 --> 02:50:53.895]  I don't like seeing anybody buy into this stuff.
[02:50:55.120 --> 02:51:01.850]  I don't feel powerful looking at Michael Moore, a total piece of crap, traitor to humanity, a total lying slug, who knows full well what he's doing.
[02:51:01.850 --> 02:51:03.232]  I feel bad.
[02:51:03.232 --> 02:51:08.279]  And I'm not lecturing, but Chenning, I just, you talk to these guys, not just him, I talk to these guys on and off air, you name it.
[02:51:09.312 --> 02:51:17.199]  People who are higher up, the CIA, the machinic, and they just are like, don't worry about that, it's the big stuff, the big narratives, you know, the government, worry about that.
[02:51:17.199 --> 02:51:31.332]  I fundamentally believe in broadcasting the truth everywhere, and that you inform the public in general about liberty, and that tyrants will disappear like phantoms at dawn, to quote Thomas Jefferson, or paraphrase him.
[02:51:31.332 --> 02:51:33.654]  And it's not that I'm here saying I have all the answers.
[02:51:34.622 --> 02:51:50.511]  I just instinctively have to try to sit there and, I mean, I walked into a place yesterday for dinner and I had a couple of young, attractive ladies giggling, go, oh, it's Alex Jones, the guy that says your TV's watching you.
[02:51:50.511 --> 02:51:56.755]  And then I realized that their lawyer husbands or boyfriends came over to the table right after that.
[02:51:56.755 --> 02:51:59.256]  Well, Alex Jones, we watch you, we're just talking about you today.
[02:51:59.256 --> 02:52:00.557]  And I'm, oh yeah, I'm sure you were.
[02:52:00.557 --> 02:52:03.399]  See, the fact that I'm right,
[02:52:04.611 --> 02:52:06.993]  Is what makes me even funnier.
[02:52:06.993 --> 02:52:10.095]  Because they have to make it a joke that I'm so right.
[02:52:10.095 --> 02:52:14.778]  Because, see, then they might have to do something that their TV's watching them.
[02:52:14.778 --> 02:52:25.925]  Because, see, if they caught me, those same couples, in their house or condo, putting a camera in their bedroom, or caught me in their bedroom, they would beat me to death.
[02:52:25.925 --> 02:52:27.246]  If they caught you in there, they'd do it.
[02:52:27.246 --> 02:52:29.767]  And rightfully so.
[02:52:29.767 --> 02:52:30.448]  Or die trying.
[02:52:31.937 --> 02:52:47.129]  But because it's this big uber-mentioned super state up there in the sky, we just accept it like it's God, and then everyone tries to climb that staircase to heaven so they can be over other people.
[02:52:47.129 --> 02:52:48.310]  What the hell is that?
[02:52:48.310 --> 02:52:56.196]  Because anybody that's been down in a valley at night with the stars out and the trees around you and a bonfire knows the valley is the stars.
[02:52:58.404 --> 02:53:00.505]  You're already in the stars.
[02:53:00.505 --> 02:53:01.566]  You're already in the universe.
[02:53:01.566 --> 02:53:11.190]  You're on a planet, beautiful and rich and beautiful, beyond imagining, and down in the valley is the highest point.
[02:53:11.190 --> 02:53:13.251]  Here's some poetry for you.
[02:53:13.251 --> 02:53:14.112]  Let's see.
[02:53:14.112 --> 02:53:20.915]  People keep thinking they can go up, up, up, but really all they're doing is going down, down, down.
[02:53:22.742 --> 02:53:25.183]  Does that mean you don't become successful or have wealth?
[02:53:25.183 --> 02:53:29.265]  Wealth is to protect yourself and take care of those you love and to build.
[02:53:29.265 --> 02:53:31.886]  It's not so you can sit there like a peacock.
[02:53:31.886 --> 02:53:34.067]  I can't live in a rich area.
[02:53:34.067 --> 02:53:35.628]  Can't live around those people.
[02:53:35.628 --> 02:53:37.649]  Because on average, they're so soulless.
[02:53:37.649 --> 02:53:41.611]  There are some people that are nice.
[02:53:41.611 --> 02:53:42.351]  But you can't live anywhere.
[02:53:42.351 --> 02:53:45.513]  If you live in a blue collar area, they're all freaked out about who's got more money or whatever.
[02:53:45.513 --> 02:53:50.175]  As if that's some symbol of who's got a bigger soul, who's got more will, who's got more strength.
[02:53:55.379 --> 02:54:02.721]  If I could slit my throat and pour my will out into humanity and die right now, that made us defeat these people, I would do it.
[02:54:02.721 --> 02:54:03.902]  But here's the secret.
[02:54:03.902 --> 02:54:05.602]  I'm not even that strong.
[02:54:05.602 --> 02:54:11.164]  I have awareness of my will, though, and history, and that's why I have effect on them.
[02:54:11.164 --> 02:54:16.926]  And if the people ever realize this and the bushfires of liberty ignite, they're going to be
[02:54:19.884 --> 02:54:26.128]  Charging out of the mist individuals that will be a hundred times more effective than I've been.
[02:54:26.128 --> 02:54:29.450]  Right now, I'm still waiting for them.
[02:54:29.450 --> 02:54:31.331]  But I know it's coming.
[02:54:31.331 --> 02:54:33.252]  And so the globalists should know this.
[02:54:33.252 --> 02:54:35.374]  Trump is only the first level of this event.
[02:54:36.590 --> 02:54:37.831]  It's going to get bigger.
[02:54:37.831 --> 02:54:38.971]  It's going to get quicker.
[02:54:38.971 --> 02:54:40.172]  It's going to get stronger.
[02:54:40.172 --> 02:54:42.073]  We are the humans that built all this.
[02:54:42.073 --> 02:54:46.575]  The elite believe because we built this, they're God, and they're going to cut us off.
[02:54:46.575 --> 02:54:53.299]  You will then see what humans really do under stress once we have a platform to build on.
[02:54:53.299 --> 02:54:57.261]  You can't just manifest with your mind magically in a cave 10,000 years ago.
[02:54:57.261 --> 02:55:00.363]  You could envision, though, and those dreams became what we have now.
[02:55:00.363 --> 02:55:02.724]  We're now on a launch deck.
[02:55:04.935 --> 02:55:05.775]  That's unlimited.
[02:55:05.775 --> 02:55:11.518]  And the elites know that and they're so jealous, they're so angry, they're so upset, they don't know what to do.
[02:55:11.518 --> 02:55:16.660]  Because they're sitting around not even knowing how to use what they've got.
[02:55:16.660 --> 02:55:18.641]  Because they didn't develop it.
[02:55:18.641 --> 02:55:19.761]  They're falling.
[02:55:19.761 --> 02:55:20.741]  Even further than we are.
[02:55:20.741 --> 02:55:30.545]  And that's why everything they use, we develop, turns into some nightmare because we've got bad people in control of those systems.
[02:55:30.545 --> 02:55:33.427]  Transparency is the only option.
[02:55:33.427 --> 02:55:34.327]  Secrecy is death.
[02:55:35.865 --> 02:55:38.346]  Transparency is the only option.
[02:55:38.346 --> 02:55:40.367]  Secrecy is death.
[02:55:40.367 --> 02:55:42.488]  That's a quote.
[02:55:42.488 --> 02:55:43.548]  But tell them I need some plugs.
[02:55:43.548 --> 02:55:46.569]  I want to get some more of these Nunes clips.
[02:55:46.569 --> 02:55:48.110]  So which one about Nunes and Rand Paul?
[02:55:48.110 --> 02:55:49.470]  They came out and said, of course they're spying.
[02:55:49.470 --> 02:55:50.851]  Of course this is going on.
[02:55:50.851 --> 02:55:51.831]  And then here's the documents.
[02:55:51.831 --> 02:55:55.072]  See, that's what they... You're like, well that's not that big a deal.
[02:55:55.072 --> 02:55:55.933]  We already knew that.
[02:55:55.933 --> 02:56:01.375]  They're up there in that big platform around all those cowards, around all those sellouts, believing the lies.
[02:56:06.792 --> 02:56:08.413]  So, think about that.
[02:56:08.413 --> 02:56:13.094]  Think about being in the middle of that and then doing what Nunes did.
[02:56:13.094 --> 02:56:15.595]  You can't help but admire it, can you?
[02:56:15.595 --> 02:56:17.015]  The enemy can't stand that.
[02:56:17.015 --> 02:56:20.116]  What a dumb move, Nunes!
[02:56:20.116 --> 02:56:26.498]  You'll never get the speakership now!
[02:56:26.498 --> 02:56:27.738]  What a joke!
[02:56:27.738 --> 02:56:30.359]  As if Nunes needs the speakership.
[02:56:30.359 --> 02:56:33.180]  He gets the speakership of being a speaker.
[02:56:33.180 --> 02:56:36.401]  He gets the title by being the leader.
[02:56:37.765 --> 02:56:46.708]  Not by scum giving him titles that they stole from other people.
[02:56:46.708 --> 02:56:52.150]  It was once said that great men and women aren't made the times they live in make them.
[02:56:52.150 --> 02:56:53.270]  That's partially true.
[02:56:53.270 --> 02:57:00.653]  The times you live in are the opportunity and then who you are and what you stand for is the final equation.
[02:57:00.653 --> 02:57:05.635]  I love the media called him a coward and a minion of Trump because he came and said what everybody else already knew.
[02:57:06.673 --> 02:57:10.454]  In a position of authority, when it's the opposite.
[02:57:10.454 --> 02:57:17.955]  When they've been told by the FBI and everybody else, Nunes, you go tell the truth, you'll be destroyed.
[02:57:17.955 --> 02:57:19.996]  And now they're trying to destroy him.
[02:57:19.996 --> 02:57:29.337]  And now Nunes transcends from the realm of the normal man into the arena of the real man.
[02:57:29.337 --> 02:57:32.718]  And that's the arena that Donald Trump and many others are in.
[02:57:34.929 --> 02:57:38.572]  And that's the arena that other people need to aspire to be part of.
[02:57:38.572 --> 02:57:48.500]  Because when men start trying to be men again, and actually stand up for what's good and honorable, then we'll have a civilization.
[02:57:48.500 --> 02:57:52.963]  I'm going to come back and play a few more clubs, then hand the baton to John Rappaport, who always does a fabulous job.
[02:57:52.963 --> 02:57:56.166]  I'm going to do some extra interviews with Nick Baggage, Dr. Nick Baggage.
[02:57:56.166 --> 02:57:58.928]  Wow, great getting to have him in person for 20 years.
[02:57:58.928 --> 02:58:00.649]  It's at least been 20, 21 years.
[02:58:00.649 --> 02:58:02.350]  I've been interviewing him since like 1996.
[02:58:02.350 --> 02:58:02.911]  Man, I'm getting old.
[02:58:04.435 --> 02:58:07.037]  Briefly, the new toothpaste is back in.
[02:58:07.037 --> 02:58:08.798]  We don't do artificial scarcity on purpose, obviously.
[02:58:08.798 --> 02:58:10.699]  It sells out in a week every time it comes in.
[02:58:10.699 --> 02:58:17.223]  It's just that it's hard to get the tubes, the manufacturing, and you have to get in with the big firm that makes it, the big organic company that has the number one organic toothpaste.
[02:58:17.223 --> 02:58:18.744]  Everybody knows their names up in Maine.
[02:58:18.744 --> 02:58:20.265]  That's who makes our toothpaste.
[02:58:20.265 --> 02:58:21.466]  We can't say it in the contract.
[02:58:22.246 --> 02:58:28.208]  We have super blue, non-fluorine toothpaste, peppermint, and tea tree oil, with iodine and nano-silver made in their factory.
[02:58:28.208 --> 02:58:29.268]  They just add that in.
[02:58:29.268 --> 02:58:32.669]  Those are available at InfoWarsStore.com and ForLife.com.
[02:58:32.669 --> 02:58:38.310]  And the big 20, 30, 40 percent, it's 30 to 40 percent off on high-quality, storable foods ends this Sunday.
[02:58:38.310 --> 02:58:39.711]  Help support the broadcast.
[02:58:39.711 --> 02:58:41.591]  Help support resistance against tyranny.
[02:58:41.591 --> 02:58:42.451]  Fourth hour coming up.
[02:58:42.451 --> 02:58:43.552]  Spread that link.
[02:58:43.552 --> 02:58:44.852]  InfoWars.com, ForLife.com.
[02:58:49.895 --> 02:58:54.380]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[02:58:54.380 --> 02:59:05.332]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[02:59:05.492 --> 02:59:10.534]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[02:59:10.534 --> 02:59:14.815]  It helps balance the thyroid gland, it helps detoxify.
[02:59:14.815 --> 02:59:17.696]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[02:59:17.696 --> 02:59:21.237]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually
[02:59:21.237 --> 02:59:22.478]  It's actually used all over the body.
[02:59:22.478 --> 02:59:28.720]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[02:59:28.720 --> 02:59:34.163]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[02:59:34.163 --> 02:59:35.763]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[02:59:35.763 --> 02:59:36.764]  This is so key.
[02:59:36.764 --> 02:59:41.085]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[02:59:41.085 --> 02:59:43.306]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[02:59:43.306 --> 02:59:46.768]  Exclusively available at InfowarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:59:52.449 --> 03:00:11.039]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:11.039 --> 03:00:15.562]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:15.562 --> 03:00:21.585]  I used to be such a sleepy thing, so hey, got a hold of me.
[03:00:28.835 --> 03:00:33.564]  Well, breaking in the sun as we speak up on InfoWars.com and DrudgeReport.com
[03:00:36.132 --> 03:00:45.919]  Nigel Probe, Nigel Farage, faces an Ofcom investigation after calling Sweden the rape capital of the world during a radio show.
[03:00:45.919 --> 03:00:52.905]  And Sweden is the rape capital of the world because they're very passive and the Muslims are raping hundreds of people a week there.
[03:00:52.905 --> 03:01:01.211]  But you can't even say in the UK that Muslims attacked yesterday on the bridge cornered over the Thames River by Big Ben.
[03:01:01.211 --> 03:01:03.352]  Nigel Farage faces investigation.
[03:01:04.241 --> 03:01:20.047]  Of course, Le Pen, leading the polls in France, is under indictment for saying the greatest threat France has faced since the Nazi occupation of the 1940s is radical Islam, and for stating the sky is blue.
[03:01:20.047 --> 03:01:21.868]  She's under federal indictment.
[03:01:23.399 --> 03:01:32.942]  Nigel Farage is to be investigated by broadcasting watchdog over comments made by LBC Radio Show during which he referred to Sweden as the rape capital of the world.
[03:01:32.942 --> 03:01:34.342]  Yes, and they're in the news today.
[03:01:34.342 --> 03:01:37.463]  The FEC wants to shut down Drudge.
[03:01:37.463 --> 03:01:43.325]  The former UKIP leader, 52, began hosting an hour-long weeknight phone-in LBC Radio Show in January.
[03:01:44.432 --> 03:01:51.458]  Ofcom is now assessing comments he made on the show about the refugee crisis when he referred to Sweden as the rape capital of the world.
[03:01:51.458 --> 03:01:53.239]  And the UK has got these police.
[03:01:53.239 --> 03:01:55.681]  They've all got thought police.
[03:01:55.681 --> 03:02:05.869]  His remarks which were made on February 20th and went unchallenged sparked nine complaints by the Islamists that are openly saying, Queen of England, move out or we're going to get you.
[03:02:06.872 --> 03:02:11.994]  The Ofcom statement said we're investigating whether comments made in the program were materially misleading.
[03:02:11.994 --> 03:02:15.796]  Yes, it's misleading to say, no judge, no jury.
[03:02:15.796 --> 03:02:17.256]  You don't have to actually have a trial now.
[03:02:17.256 --> 03:02:20.337]  You just say Muslims think that women are slaves.
[03:02:20.337 --> 03:02:21.058]  That, you know, that's a lie.
[03:02:21.058 --> 03:02:23.239]  No, that's the truth!
[03:02:23.239 --> 03:02:26.520]  And a lot of people can't handle the truth!
[03:02:26.520 --> 03:02:30.962]  I sat back and tried to stop those wars because they were knocking out non-radical Muslim countries.
[03:02:30.962 --> 03:02:32.282]  And I want Muslims to have freedom.
[03:02:32.282 --> 03:02:35.904]  I know most Muslims are heretics and don't want to be under their own religion.
[03:02:35.904 --> 03:02:36.444]  I've talked to them.
[03:02:37.568 --> 03:02:44.074]  But the people running it make the KKK look like cupcakes.
[03:02:44.074 --> 03:02:55.505]  As I started being honest about five years ago, I said, if I'm going to go protest the KKK and La Raza, that's like a brown KKK, I'm going to go protest the Muslims.
[03:02:55.505 --> 03:03:00.570]  I mean, you know, there isn't a bigger cult in the world than Wahhabism.
[03:03:00.570 --> 03:03:00.790]  I mean,
[03:03:02.300 --> 03:03:05.441]  I go to Saudi Arabia, five minutes, preach Christianity, I'm going to be locked up.
[03:03:05.441 --> 03:03:09.382]  Do it again, they'll cut my hands off or kill me!
[03:03:09.382 --> 03:03:12.723]  I'm supposed to bring people in like this and then bow down to them?
[03:03:12.723 --> 03:03:16.464]  No, I'm not doing it.
[03:03:16.464 --> 03:03:17.544]  You know, I love Nigel Farage.
[03:03:17.544 --> 03:03:18.625]  It's just like Rand Paul.
[03:03:18.625 --> 03:03:22.526]  I don't get big boost in ratings when Rand Paul's on or Nigel Farage.
[03:03:22.526 --> 03:03:30.348]  Quite frankly, I find myself unlistenable most of the time, but I have the most listeners than Paul Watson after me on talk radio.
[03:03:31.414 --> 03:03:32.714]  We can watch the computer numbers.
[03:03:32.714 --> 03:03:34.395]  We can see them come in.
[03:03:34.395 --> 03:03:36.415]  If I found 20 people better than me, I'd put them on air.
[03:03:36.415 --> 03:03:36.795]  I don't care.
[03:03:36.795 --> 03:03:40.056]  Black, white, Hispanic, whatever they were.
[03:03:40.056 --> 03:03:40.717]  You're on air.
[03:03:40.717 --> 03:03:41.977]  You do better than me, you're on tomorrow.
[03:03:41.977 --> 03:03:42.637]  I'm gone.
[03:03:42.637 --> 03:03:47.538]  I'm going to run the show and just sit back and drink lemonade.
[03:03:47.538 --> 03:03:50.779]  But, it's like Rand Paul.
[03:03:50.779 --> 03:03:52.360]  People ask, when does Rand Paul come on?
[03:03:52.360 --> 03:03:53.520]  When he calls and wants to come on.
[03:03:56.474 --> 03:04:03.361]  I have to, if I want him on, I have to call his home number in Kentucky and talk to his wife when she's there, and then he comes on like two days later.
[03:04:03.361 --> 03:04:07.385]  That's an example of what Trump's under.
[03:04:07.385 --> 03:04:09.247]  Rand Paul's like, yeah, call me anytime I want to come on.
[03:04:09.247 --> 03:04:10.148]  Why don't you ever have me on?
[03:04:10.148 --> 03:04:11.890]  It wasn't talked.
[03:04:11.890 --> 03:04:15.013]  His people won't return Nico Acosta's calls.
[03:04:15.013 --> 03:04:16.554]  And again, it's not like we need Rand Paul.
[03:04:16.554 --> 03:04:17.195]  He's a great guy.
[03:04:17.195 --> 03:04:17.695]  We want him on.
[03:04:18.857 --> 03:04:21.959]  Nigel Farage, I see him, he goes, yeah, I'm never on the show, here's my card, have me on.
[03:04:21.959 --> 03:04:36.428]  I have to call him to get him on because his booker people are mainstream and have decided he doesn't need to come on my show, even though Nigel Farage admits he got half of UKIP growth out of Infowars 15 years ago on the show.
[03:04:36.428 --> 03:04:40.510]  And look, I'm not even bitching, it's just inside baseball how Trump's having his agenda blocked.
[03:04:40.510 --> 03:04:46.794]  If I can't get Nigel Farage or Rand Paul on except when they call me, no one's like, I haven't heard from you in years.
[03:04:46.794 --> 03:04:48.275]  I'm like, your people, well, I'll talk to them.
[03:04:49.218 --> 03:04:53.120]  And then, the next time we want them on, we get them on.
[03:04:53.120 --> 03:04:54.561]  The next time, they ignore us.
[03:04:54.561 --> 03:04:56.042]  It's the gatekeepers.
[03:04:56.042 --> 03:04:56.843]  It's like a cult.
[03:04:56.843 --> 03:04:58.964]  They just get off on stolen power.
[03:05:00.049 --> 03:05:03.851]  The health care reform hearing on the Hill today has been a clown act.
[03:05:03.851 --> 03:05:15.298]  You have Democrats taking the podium to passionately complain about the new health care bill, saying it's the worst ever, when it's still government-controlled health care, which is what they cheered for seven years ago, and still today.
[03:05:15.298 --> 03:05:18.059]  I'm beginning to think this was yet another Trump troll.
[03:05:18.059 --> 03:05:25.924]  Make Democrats stop progress of a GOP health care bill that's virtually the same bill they complained the GOP was stopping the progress of.
[03:05:25.924 --> 03:05:27.885]  The epitome of partisan politics.
[03:05:28.445 --> 03:05:34.806]  Democrats are also complaining they haven't seen the bill, but here was Nancy Pelosi when fighting for Obamacare.
[03:05:34.806 --> 03:05:39.827]  But we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it.
[03:05:39.827 --> 03:05:45.288]  She's having hearings today, trying to stop the new health care bill, complaining she hasn't seen it.
[03:05:45.288 --> 03:05:47.709]  What an absolute fraud.
[03:05:47.709 --> 03:05:51.030]  Just chalk this up to more fallout from Obama fail.
[03:05:51.030 --> 03:05:55.370]  Trump is meeting with the House Freedom Caucus today, who could stall the bill in the House.
[03:05:55.370 --> 03:05:57.871]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[03:06:00.376 --> 03:06:01.957]  This is Alex Jones.
[03:06:01.957 --> 03:06:07.219]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[03:06:07.219 --> 03:06:10.421]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[03:06:10.421 --> 03:06:16.224]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[03:06:16.224 --> 03:06:21.927]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house.
[03:06:22.347 --> 03:06:25.310]  Like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[03:06:25.310 --> 03:06:30.876]  Plus, you can take it with you to jump-start cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[03:06:30.876 --> 03:06:37.584]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[03:06:37.884 --> 03:06:42.726]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.
[03:06:42.726 --> 03:06:46.027]  Go to PrivatePowerGrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[03:06:46.027 --> 03:06:48.108]  That's PrivatePowerGrid.com.

[03:06:56.270 --> 03:06:57.951]  That's PrivatePowerGrid.com.
[03:07:00.660 --> 03:07:06.144]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[03:07:06.144 --> 03:07:06.984]  I take this.
[03:07:06.984 --> 03:07:08.105]  My family takes this.
[03:07:08.105 --> 03:07:12.408]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[03:07:12.408 --> 03:07:16.611]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:07:16.991 --> 03:07:21.633]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[03:07:21.633 --> 03:07:22.774]  I don't feel good.
[03:07:22.774 --> 03:07:26.536]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[03:07:26.536 --> 03:07:29.217]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[03:07:29.217 --> 03:07:35.020]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[03:07:35.020 --> 03:07:37.981]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[03:07:37.981 --> 03:07:41.503]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[03:07:41.503 --> 03:07:43.744]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[03:07:43.744 --> 03:07:44.104]  I love it.
[03:07:44.264 --> 03:07:47.046]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[03:07:47.046 --> 03:07:48.086]  Survival Shield X2.
[03:07:48.086 --> 03:07:53.729]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[03:07:53.729 --> 03:07:55.911]  It's got a five-star rating.
[03:07:55.911 --> 03:08:05.896]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[03:08:05.896 --> 03:08:06.797]  From the front line.
[03:08:09.068 --> 03:08:14.632]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[03:08:14.632 --> 03:08:16.013]  Mother!
[03:08:16.013 --> 03:08:18.354]  Mother!
[03:08:18.354 --> 03:08:20.996]  Tell your children not to walk my way!
[03:08:20.996 --> 03:08:24.738]  Tell your children not to hear my words!
[03:08:24.738 --> 03:08:27.160]  What they mean, what they say!
[03:08:27.160 --> 03:08:29.762]  Mother!
[03:08:29.762 --> 03:08:31.423]  Mother!
[03:08:32.856 --> 03:08:36.437]  Can you keep him in the dark for life?
[03:08:36.437 --> 03:08:42.820]  Can you hide him from the way that world?
[03:08:42.820 --> 03:08:45.181]  FATHER!
[03:08:45.181 --> 03:08:49.763]  Gonna take you down tonight!
[03:08:49.763 --> 03:08:51.664]  Gonna show her my world!
[03:08:51.664 --> 03:08:53.664]  My world!
[03:08:53.664 --> 03:08:56.786]  I'm not a bounce about of the globalist false light.
[03:08:56.786 --> 03:08:59.627]  But if they wanna bang heads with me...
[03:09:05.709 --> 03:09:07.310]  And here's what's about to happen.
[03:09:07.310 --> 03:09:10.913]  We're just about to bang heads with the globalists.
[03:09:10.913 --> 03:09:11.993]  So get ready.
[03:09:11.993 --> 03:09:15.856]  This only comes around maybe every 500, 1,000 years.
[03:09:15.856 --> 03:09:28.044]  And everything's accelerated right now into this moment deciding the destiny of our species.
[03:09:28.044 --> 03:09:30.987]  Tell them not to understand.
[03:09:33.677 --> 03:09:38.521]  Alright, I want to hand the baton to the great co-host, John Rappaport of nomorefakenews.com.
[03:09:38.521 --> 03:09:41.723]  15 years ago, he coined that term, the fake news.
[03:09:41.723 --> 03:09:43.424]  Michelle, unoriginally, people are.
[03:09:43.424 --> 03:09:46.827]  By the way, Nico Acosta and the crew just made a key point.
[03:09:46.827 --> 03:09:58.456]  Just from memory, I remembered that in Europe, there are literally hundreds of rapes that go unreported every week, thousands every year, and memories, like 87% are Islamic.
[03:09:58.456 --> 03:10:01.278]  It's been in the news that the police are ordered to shut that down.
[03:10:02.898 --> 03:10:09.182]  So Trump says, you heard what happened last night in Sweden, it was actually three nights before, but then the next day there was a big rape rally.
[03:10:09.182 --> 03:10:17.707]  And the liberal women go to these anti-racism rallies, and then they get raped at them, and there's videos we can't even show you, they're on YouTube.
[03:10:17.707 --> 03:10:30.374]  So Nigel Farage, the patriot nationalist of the UK, they tried to kill, admittedly, the police have admitted this three times, plane crash, cars, the wheels off, you name it, brake lines cut.
[03:10:31.226 --> 03:10:32.507]  We even go to Wikipedia.
[03:10:32.507 --> 03:10:42.556]  So Wikipedia, that's the headline, with crime statistics from the EU admits Sweden is correct, rate capital of the world per capita.
[03:10:42.556 --> 03:10:44.157]  Looks like by population it is too.
[03:10:44.157 --> 03:10:45.658]  Good God!
[03:10:45.658 --> 03:10:47.380]  That's rate per hundred thousand.
[03:10:47.380 --> 03:10:53.505]  So they're looking at arresting him right now under all these EU, UK anti-free speech laws.
[03:10:53.505 --> 03:10:54.726]  That is incredible.
[03:10:54.726 --> 03:10:59.330]  You know, I want to just talk about one more thing, get out of here, but John Rappaport, my friend,
[03:11:02.642 --> 03:11:04.004]  We know they were surveilling Trump.
[03:11:04.004 --> 03:11:05.066]  They bragged two months ago.
[03:11:05.066 --> 03:11:06.548]  We covered it here on air.
[03:11:06.548 --> 03:11:07.810]  We said, wow, they're illegally doing this.
[03:11:07.810 --> 03:11:08.631]  Look at Big Brother.
[03:11:08.631 --> 03:11:09.753]  This ought to wake Trump up.
[03:11:09.753 --> 03:11:10.574]  It did.
[03:11:10.574 --> 03:11:12.577]  Our big criticism was he was pro-surveillance, remember?
[03:11:13.513 --> 03:11:14.473]  He wakes up to that.
[03:11:14.473 --> 03:11:15.474]  They go, oh, you're crazy.
[03:11:15.474 --> 03:11:16.294]  We never said that.
[03:11:16.294 --> 03:11:18.595]  Now Nunes comes out and says, yeah, they were surveilling.
[03:11:18.595 --> 03:11:19.875]  I head up the intelligence committee.
[03:11:19.875 --> 03:11:22.336]  Now they're calling him a Russian agent sitting investigating.
[03:11:22.336 --> 03:11:24.576]  And they're calling Rand Paul an actual agent.
[03:11:24.576 --> 03:11:25.977]  I'm under criminal investigation.
[03:11:25.977 --> 03:11:27.037]  Just Google it.
[03:11:27.037 --> 03:11:31.139]  Wikipedia, McClatchy, AP Reuters.
[03:11:31.139 --> 03:11:38.121]  I'm being looked at by the FBI, anti-espionage, counter, you know, state group, as being run by the Russians.
[03:11:38.121 --> 03:11:38.581]  Because you heard
[03:11:39.741 --> 03:11:44.283]  Maxine Waters, she said, like Trump and others, actually get our orders from Putin.
[03:11:44.283 --> 03:11:46.023]  I can't get a word in edgewise.
[03:11:46.023 --> 03:11:46.983]  Nobody gives me ideas, hardly.
[03:11:46.983 --> 03:11:49.324]  I'm a motor mouth, but I wish someone was giving me ideas.
[03:11:49.324 --> 03:11:50.865]  I mean, you give me ideas.
[03:11:50.865 --> 03:11:52.885]  I actually listen to John Bradford when he hosts this show at night.
[03:11:52.885 --> 03:11:54.426]  I want to get home at night and listen to him.
[03:11:54.426 --> 03:11:54.726]  I love him.
[03:11:54.726 --> 03:11:57.447]  I go to themorefactors.com, but I mean, it's just, it's like...
[03:11:58.539 --> 03:12:09.129]  Behind the scenes they've got major news agencies following me around everywhere in Austin, PIs on me, Democratic Party official top lawyers are up my rear end right now trying to figure out a way to sue us.
[03:12:09.129 --> 03:12:10.430]  They've told me on the phone.
[03:12:10.430 --> 03:12:12.432]  So I'm dealing with this with lawyers and stuff right now.
[03:12:12.432 --> 03:12:15.715]  We've got them saying shut down Drudge, shut us down.
[03:12:15.715 --> 03:12:18.477]  They have congressional hearings saying I'm a Russian agent.
[03:12:19.238 --> 03:12:21.900]  And I'm like pinching myself, like, is this a simulation?
[03:12:21.900 --> 03:12:22.880]  John Rappaport.
[03:12:22.880 --> 03:12:24.441]  It's not about me.
[03:12:24.441 --> 03:12:27.483]  I'm just saying, what the hell is going on here?
[03:12:27.483 --> 03:12:29.144]  It must show we're over the target.
[03:12:29.144 --> 03:12:33.607]  It must show with our guests and yourself and others and what they know we're planning to do.
[03:12:33.607 --> 03:12:36.208]  Put John Rappaport on every day if he'll do it.
[03:12:36.208 --> 03:12:41.912]  They are scared because they know, they know humanity's already awake.
[03:12:41.912 --> 03:12:46.034]  And I think if they can kill a few lead elephants, somehow everybody else is going to wander off.
[03:12:46.034 --> 03:12:46.835]  Don't they understand?
[03:12:48.015 --> 03:12:49.115]  You've heard of a Midas touch.
[03:12:49.115 --> 03:12:51.817]  They've got a disease touch.
[03:12:51.817 --> 03:12:54.217]  Everything they do now turns to dust.
[03:12:54.217 --> 03:12:57.159]  Before it was all working, it's like something metaphysically flipped.
[03:12:57.159 --> 03:12:58.499]  John Rappaport.
[03:12:58.499 --> 03:13:04.522]  Yeah, it flipped completely because there's too many people that are now awake, Alex.
[03:13:04.522 --> 03:13:07.083]  So how do you put the genie back in the bottle?
[03:13:07.083 --> 03:13:08.223]  You can't.
[03:13:08.223 --> 03:13:10.184]  It doesn't work.
[03:13:10.184 --> 03:13:14.886]  People have, first of all, people suddenly understand the difference between
[03:13:16.047 --> 03:13:18.449]  Nationalism and globalism.
[03:13:18.449 --> 03:13:21.732]  All of a sudden, wow, I hadn't thought about that for 20 years.
[03:13:21.732 --> 03:13:23.393]  Now I see the difference.
[03:13:23.393 --> 03:13:33.401]  I see why the jobs are all going away, people out of work, factories going abroad, traitors, you know, treason, economic treason.
[03:13:33.401 --> 03:13:34.262]  I get it now.
[03:13:34.262 --> 03:13:35.323]  I see it.
[03:13:35.323 --> 03:13:37.125]  How are you going to put that back in the bottle?
[03:13:37.125 --> 03:13:37.565]  You can't.
[03:13:38.664 --> 03:13:47.457]  So apparently they've come up with the most ridiculous thing they can possibly say, this whole thing about Putin and Russia.
[03:13:47.457 --> 03:13:50.021]  I mean, this sort of follows the theory of
[03:13:50.967 --> 03:14:03.113]  You tell one ridiculous lie, and if people don't believe it, then you multiply the ridiculous-osity of the whole thing by a million, and you tell another lie.
[03:14:03.113 --> 03:14:04.114]  That's the Hitler rule.
[03:14:04.114 --> 03:14:05.875]  The bigger the lie, the more they'll believe it.
[03:14:05.875 --> 03:14:09.837]  But not... That was when Hitler had the newsreels and radio and all the newspapers.
[03:14:09.837 --> 03:14:12.178]  Hitler... These people don't have total control of the media.
[03:14:12.867 --> 03:14:14.547]  Yeah, they're losing.
[03:14:14.547 --> 03:14:16.168]  They're already losing.
[03:14:16.168 --> 03:14:18.709]  All they do is they just echo each other.
[03:14:18.709 --> 03:14:21.149]  You know, it's like a little gossip circle.
[03:14:21.149 --> 03:14:22.790]  It's a false reality.
[03:14:22.790 --> 03:14:27.471]  Yeah, because in the New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, they just... Ha!
[03:14:27.471 --> 03:14:28.831]  No one's being surveilled!
[03:14:28.831 --> 03:14:30.291]  That's crazy!
[03:14:30.291 --> 03:14:32.092]  When a week before, they're saying they're surveilling.
[03:14:32.864 --> 03:14:39.245]  Yeah, you know, or did you hear what Trump said and the thing and whatever and then he denied it and he said it and what do you think of that?
[03:14:39.245 --> 03:14:42.566]  Well, I think it's terrible and so and then another station picks it up.
[03:14:42.566 --> 03:14:44.867]  It's just like a bunch of gossip girls sitting around.
[03:14:44.867 --> 03:14:47.607]  Did you hear what she said about Obama?
[03:14:47.607 --> 03:14:49.467]  Meanwhile, what is he doing?
[03:14:49.467 --> 03:14:50.808]  What is he actually doing?
[03:14:50.808 --> 03:14:54.909]  I mean, look, here's a stupendous thing.
[03:14:54.909 --> 03:14:56.409]  He's proposing
[03:14:57.290 --> 03:15:03.495]  To cut 50% of the United Nations payout every year to the United States.
[03:15:03.495 --> 03:15:04.116]  Beautiful.
[03:15:04.116 --> 03:15:05.477]  10 billion a year.
[03:15:05.477 --> 03:15:08.620]  He's saying, yeah, let's cut it in half right now for starters.
[03:15:08.620 --> 03:15:11.863]  This is a group openly trying to take over our police and local governments.
[03:15:11.863 --> 03:15:13.164]  Openly trying to destroy our country.
[03:15:13.164 --> 03:15:14.865]  Hell yeah!
[03:15:14.865 --> 03:15:15.586]  Yeah.
[03:15:15.586 --> 03:15:18.128]  I mean, that's stupendous.
[03:15:18.128 --> 03:15:20.010]  That's an incredible thing that happened.
[03:15:20.931 --> 03:15:24.152]  Anything you can do to possibly cut the power of the United Nations.
[03:15:24.152 --> 03:15:24.932]  Wow.
[03:15:24.932 --> 03:15:27.153]  Let's have a rally and let's celebrate.
[03:15:27.153 --> 03:15:27.513]  Unbelievable.
[03:15:27.513 --> 03:15:27.953]  No, it's true.
[03:15:27.953 --> 03:15:28.774]  He's so delivering.
[03:15:28.774 --> 03:15:29.914]  But let me ask this and I gotta go.
[03:15:29.914 --> 03:15:31.795]  I know you're busy.
[03:15:31.795 --> 03:15:32.535]  The health care bill.
[03:15:32.535 --> 03:15:34.936]  We know Obamacare is a death spiral of an indirect economy.
[03:15:34.936 --> 03:15:35.736]  Gruber admits that.
[03:15:35.736 --> 03:15:36.836]  Ezekiel Emanuel admits it.
[03:15:36.836 --> 03:15:37.837]  That's a fact.
[03:15:37.837 --> 03:15:38.177]  From them.
[03:15:39.281 --> 03:15:46.424]  This is a little bit better, it's better in some ways, but it's still a big payout to big banks and insurance companies to make us buy stuff, and it's still, his price is high, not as high.
[03:15:46.424 --> 03:15:47.525]  I don't like it.
[03:15:47.525 --> 03:15:53.547]  But then I get from people off record, the Senate is like, don't worry, he knows how to get himself out of something now.
[03:15:53.547 --> 03:15:54.888]  Trump's listening to Bannon.
[03:15:54.888 --> 03:15:57.329]  Go in, okay, okay, let the Republicans destroy.
[03:15:58.949 --> 03:16:00.410]  What's his name?
[03:16:00.410 --> 03:16:02.510]  Blue Eyes Paul Ryan.
[03:16:02.510 --> 03:16:04.771]  Then Trump comes in and negotiates a deal.
[03:16:04.771 --> 03:16:06.091]  Healthcare showdown.
[03:16:06.091 --> 03:16:07.591]  Rebelling Republicans risk wrath.
[03:16:07.591 --> 03:16:09.092]  White House final offer.
[03:16:09.092 --> 03:16:09.832]  Vote may be delayed.
[03:16:09.832 --> 03:16:15.133]  But they put his whole future, his destiny on this one deal.
[03:16:15.133 --> 03:16:19.734]  Now I know Trump likes to troll the globalists, but this may be a miscalculation.
[03:16:21.104 --> 03:16:33.709]  Well, maybe it is, but I think it's a media-driven, quote, miscalculation, because look at how many times bills have been voted down that the White House wanted, and what do they do?
[03:16:33.709 --> 03:16:37.871]  Three days later, they turn around and they bring it back, or they propose a slightly different bill.
[03:16:37.871 --> 03:16:38.631]  Sure, so it's a process.
[03:16:38.631 --> 03:16:40.892]  Well, the inside baseball is, he's learning.
[03:16:40.892 --> 03:16:42.173]  They're saying, put it on Congress.
[03:16:42.173 --> 03:16:43.553]  They always give it to the President.
[03:16:43.553 --> 03:16:46.454]  The constitutional role is, make them do it.
[03:16:46.454 --> 03:16:47.575]  This is what we keep asking for.
[03:16:48.530 --> 03:16:49.450]  Exactly.
[03:16:49.450 --> 03:16:51.991]  I mean, this is no big deal as far as I'm concerned.
[03:16:51.991 --> 03:16:54.772]  It's the media that are saying, this is it.
[03:16:54.772 --> 03:16:59.033]  You know, if he can't get this passed the way he wants to, he's finished, wipes out.
[03:16:59.033 --> 03:17:00.153]  Nonsense.
[03:17:00.153 --> 03:17:04.794]  Say, okay, so you guys are going to now risk your careers by voting.
[03:17:04.794 --> 03:17:06.074]  Okay, fine.
[03:17:06.074 --> 03:17:07.795]  Oh, we'll introduce something later.
[03:17:07.795 --> 03:17:08.555]  Okay.
[03:17:08.555 --> 03:17:10.476]  And then two weeks later, here we go.
[03:17:10.476 --> 03:17:11.696]  A different version.
[03:17:12.301 --> 03:17:14.423]  That's what I see is he didn't commit himself early.
[03:17:14.423 --> 03:17:15.343]  Now he kind of is.
[03:17:15.343 --> 03:17:17.985]  We'll see.
[03:17:17.985 --> 03:17:21.168]  Trump's disproven me wrong quite a bit.
[03:17:21.168 --> 03:17:22.609]  More canny than I thought.
[03:17:22.609 --> 03:17:23.750]  So we'll see what happens.
[03:17:24.784 --> 03:17:27.446]  I think they're just going to reintroduce another version.
[03:17:27.446 --> 03:17:28.727]  They're going to say, hey, guess what?
[03:17:28.727 --> 03:17:29.567]  We're still alive.
[03:17:29.567 --> 03:17:31.649]  We're still in the White House.
[03:17:31.649 --> 03:17:33.690]  You know, the sky didn't fall.
[03:17:33.690 --> 03:17:34.871]  And here's a better version.
[03:17:34.871 --> 03:17:35.251]  Well, sure.
[03:17:35.251 --> 03:17:41.315]  In fact, the big, you know, conservative caucuses have said, well, they're talking to Trump and he's actually signaling that's good.
[03:17:41.315 --> 03:17:44.917]  So that's why what I was told a week ago has now been confirmed that that's what Trump's doing.
[03:17:44.917 --> 03:17:46.479]  So, again, there's no deception.
[03:17:46.479 --> 03:17:49.160]  He's just he's just learning how to pull himself out of something.
[03:17:49.160 --> 03:17:52.082]  So he doesn't get the crossfire of the whole deal, which is fine.
[03:17:52.082 --> 03:17:54.084]  We're going to skip the break so you have more time.
[03:17:54.084 --> 03:17:54.544]  Just briefly.
[03:17:55.384 --> 03:18:20.497]  It's back in stock but we make like four or five dollars a tube on super blue that my dad's a dentist designed with the top maker in the country that you know you know the name of the organic fluoride free toothpaste well that's what makes ours but we can't say it's a private labeling but then they add to it iodine and then also nano silver peppermint and tea tree oil super blue and by the way I don't do this on purpose there's a lot of stuff we keep you know in stock now like x2 and things
[03:18:21.597 --> 03:18:28.323]  It's that you ramp up, and then the tube we chose keeps selling out, and then they haven't set up in their factory a run for us yet.
[03:18:28.323 --> 03:18:36.570]  They're so busy making their toothpastes, because organics are so popular, that instead of making, you know, 10,000 tubes, I'm looking at making 50,000 next, so I don't sell out so quick.
[03:18:36.570 --> 03:18:39.513]  We got a very small, like, half order, like 5,000 tubes.
[03:18:39.513 --> 03:18:40.454]  It's about to sell out.
[03:18:40.814 --> 03:18:44.737]  We've got the bubblegum flavor coming in for kids that isn't as strong next week.
[03:18:44.737 --> 03:18:46.759]  But your purchase makes the broadcast possible.
[03:18:46.759 --> 03:18:51.362]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:18:51.362 --> 03:18:55.225]  But more importantly, we don't get high quality storable food and things because we're in fear.
[03:18:55.225 --> 03:18:57.948]  We do it to be in charge and secure.
[03:18:57.948 --> 03:19:00.269]  And every successful species stores food.
[03:19:00.269 --> 03:19:02.031]  The Best Company is my Patriot.
[03:19:02.031 --> 03:19:04.733]  We have their full line, updated daily with our latest specials.
[03:19:04.733 --> 03:19:05.413]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:19:06.334 --> 03:19:14.239]  We have all the great reviews, but InfoWars selects their whole line, private label by us, at the factory, so we can contractually go occasionally lower than them.
[03:19:14.239 --> 03:19:18.781]  The contract says 10%, but I twist their arm occasionally to go 30-40%.
[03:19:18.781 --> 03:19:20.382]  That's one of these windows.
[03:19:20.382 --> 03:19:24.345]  InfoWarsLive.com, InfoWarsStore.com, 30-40% off.
[03:19:24.345 --> 03:19:26.326]  We got specialty foods, whole spectrums.
[03:19:27.577 --> 03:19:29.057]  Your purchase supports the broadcast.
[03:19:29.057 --> 03:19:34.039]  We have the new Defender special body armor and the Nanotech body armor from Citizens Defense.
[03:19:34.039 --> 03:19:35.019]  It's all there.
[03:19:35.019 --> 03:19:37.180]  Inforestore.com takes a lot of money.
[03:19:37.180 --> 03:19:39.881]  NSR Tactical Kydex holsters.
[03:19:39.881 --> 03:19:40.641]  They're all there.
[03:19:40.641 --> 03:19:47.503]  And when you shop with us, you get great deals at great prices and you're funding a group that has the enemy completely in our face.
[03:19:47.503 --> 03:19:48.964]  Now, I'm skipping the breaks again more time.
[03:19:50.299 --> 03:20:05.006]  Getting back to me, it's a desperation move to have them say we're investigating Alex Jones and Breitbart, two groups, as actually being Russian agents.
[03:20:05.006 --> 03:20:08.467]  I mean, that is like being told I'm a Martian, okay?
[03:20:08.467 --> 03:20:09.888]  You know, from a green flying saucer.
[03:20:12.699 --> 03:20:18.043]  I look at this, and I see what's happening, and it just tells me we must be doing something special.
[03:20:18.043 --> 03:20:21.126]  And then all the other stuff where they're saying they want to shut us down, they want to break us down.
[03:20:21.126 --> 03:20:22.487]  What do you think listeners should do?
[03:20:22.487 --> 03:20:26.350]  Because I think they need to understand, it's not like they're supporting us, they are us.
[03:20:26.350 --> 03:20:27.471]  And not just buying the product.
[03:20:27.471 --> 03:20:31.394]  Spread the link, spread the articles, because they're admittedly trying to censor us more than ever.
[03:20:31.394 --> 03:20:32.876]  So what do we do, John Robert Bourne?
[03:20:32.876 --> 03:20:34.937]  You go ahead and take over.
[03:20:34.937 --> 03:20:41.723]  Well, the first thing that you do is you spread all this information out as far as you possibly can to as many people as you possibly can.
[03:20:42.566 --> 03:20:47.690]  Because the more people who wake up, they understand what's at stake here.
[03:20:47.690 --> 03:20:54.535]  The enemy understands that there's a critical mass at which everything changes.
[03:20:54.535 --> 03:20:57.617]  We already reached a couple stages of that.
[03:20:57.617 --> 03:20:59.098]  So that's why they're all in.
[03:20:59.098 --> 03:21:00.519]  It's total commitment.
[03:21:00.519 --> 03:21:01.620]  Absolutely.
[03:21:01.620 --> 03:21:02.240]  Absolutely.
[03:21:02.240 --> 03:21:05.843]  You get to a certain point, there's no turning back on this.
[03:21:05.843 --> 03:21:08.325]  You reach another point, there's no turning back on that.
[03:21:09.167 --> 03:21:14.150]  We're in the foothills of getting globalism off our backs.
[03:21:14.150 --> 03:21:18.853]  And it's not just in America, it's in many countries that are waking up and saying, what were we doing?
[03:21:18.853 --> 03:21:22.435]  And we just got to climb the mountain, ignore their BS, and we're going to do it together.
[03:21:22.435 --> 03:21:24.096]  Absolutely.
[03:21:24.096 --> 03:21:28.699]  Keep going, sorry, this is a powerful info.
[03:21:28.699 --> 03:21:37.304]  We just keep on going and keep on going with more intensity and with more help and more colleagues and people looking at all these things from
[03:21:38.234 --> 03:21:40.255]  Important different vectors.
[03:21:40.255 --> 03:21:42.395]  Letting people know what's happening.
[03:21:42.395 --> 03:21:44.176]  I get emails all the time from people.
[03:21:44.176 --> 03:21:45.396]  I read your article about this.
[03:21:45.396 --> 03:21:46.517]  It woke me up.
[03:21:46.517 --> 03:21:51.338]  Not only to what you were talking about, but let me tell you about my experience here and there and this.
[03:21:51.338 --> 03:21:53.479]  People connect the dots.
[03:21:53.479 --> 03:21:57.880]  Everybody's got some experience with the globalists.
[03:21:59.127 --> 03:22:09.356]  Whether they know it, whether they call it, whether they name it, everybody's got some experience, some horrible experience that they have undergone.
[03:22:10.188 --> 03:22:21.036]  And when they realize what the source is and why it's happening and where it came from and what the agenda is, they now become radicalized in the best sense of the word.
[03:22:21.036 --> 03:22:21.997]  And that's what's crazy.
[03:22:21.997 --> 03:22:23.698]  The globalists admit they engineered it.
[03:22:23.698 --> 03:22:28.722]  They are literally greasing the skids for every problem we have to make it worse and getting rich off of it.
[03:22:28.722 --> 03:22:30.123]  I mean, they really are the problem.
[03:22:30.123 --> 03:22:32.285]  What will humanity do if we get them off our backs?
[03:22:32.285 --> 03:22:33.006]  And then I'm gone.
[03:22:33.006 --> 03:22:34.146]  Go ahead.
[03:22:34.146 --> 03:22:36.849]  Well, it's just going to be a complete renaissance.
[03:22:36.849 --> 03:22:39.330]  Because then people are going to say, well, I'm free.
[03:22:40.222 --> 03:22:41.383]  Now we're free.
[03:22:41.383 --> 03:22:43.544]  So what do you say we do this?
[03:22:43.544 --> 03:22:48.547]  For example, let's take a state like South Carolina or something like that.
[03:22:48.547 --> 03:22:56.312]  And let's say now that in South Carolina any health practitioner can practice whatever they do.
[03:22:56.312 --> 03:23:03.116]  As long as whatever they do is not more harmful than... Within 10 years that'll be the capital of new medicine worldwide.
[03:23:03.689 --> 03:23:04.810]  Exactly.
[03:23:04.810 --> 03:23:07.832]  It'll be the most prosperous state in the United States.
[03:23:07.832 --> 03:23:10.214]  You'll have millions of people moving there.
[03:23:10.214 --> 03:23:12.576]  There'll be an economic boom.
[03:23:12.576 --> 03:23:16.278]  Businesses will be opening up around these alternative health centers.
[03:23:16.278 --> 03:23:18.600]  Everybody will say, wow, this is prosperity.
[03:23:18.600 --> 03:23:19.401]  This is healing.
[03:23:19.401 --> 03:23:20.401]  This is health.
[03:23:20.401 --> 03:23:21.782]  This is freedom.
[03:23:21.782 --> 03:23:22.463]  I like this.
[03:23:22.463 --> 03:23:23.444]  This is terrific.
[03:23:23.444 --> 03:23:29.988]  And some other state, you know, that's down in the dumps and all in debt is going to say, well, we got to do that too.
[03:23:29.988 --> 03:23:31.830]  And if the globalists are gone,
[03:23:32.290 --> 03:23:37.372]  There's going to be nobody there to say, no, you can't do that because of that, that, that, that, that, that, that.
[03:23:37.372 --> 03:23:38.313]  Hey, it's freedom.
[03:23:38.313 --> 03:23:39.813]  It's prosperity.
[03:23:39.813 --> 03:23:41.354]  Everybody's back.
[03:23:41.354 --> 03:23:42.574]  I remember this.
[03:23:42.574 --> 03:23:45.035]  I sort of have a memory of how this used to be.
[03:23:45.035 --> 03:23:45.976]  Okay, let's go.
[03:23:45.976 --> 03:23:53.939]  Let's get this repression off our backs and let's be free and prosperous and honorable at the same time.
[03:23:53.939 --> 03:23:54.760]  Wow.
[03:23:54.760 --> 03:23:56.580]  Now you can't beat that combination.
[03:23:56.580 --> 03:23:57.781]  There's no way to beat that.
[03:24:00.526 --> 03:24:03.907]  And that's the way this whole thing takes off.
[03:24:03.907 --> 03:24:06.548]  That's the way it is taking off.
[03:24:06.548 --> 03:24:10.890]  That's the way the difference is between the future and the present.
[03:24:10.890 --> 03:24:18.193]  And let's look in respect to that another thing that Trump has proposed.
[03:24:18.193 --> 03:24:21.154]  Out of the box, I mean out of the blue, okay?
[03:24:22.170 --> 03:24:24.493]  Got to give you just a second or two of background here.
[03:24:24.493 --> 03:24:26.995]  You ever heard of the National Institutes of Health?
[03:24:26.995 --> 03:24:28.677]  Do you know what that is?
[03:24:28.677 --> 03:24:35.264]  It's a federally funded, meaning taxpayer funded, medical research institution run by the government.
[03:24:35.264 --> 03:24:36.446]  It happens to be the biggest
[03:24:37.259 --> 03:24:46.425]  Research, medical institution in the world, 20,000 employees, a gigantic budget, billions and billions of dollars every year.
[03:24:46.425 --> 03:24:57.872]  And so in Trump's proposed budget, out of nowhere, let's slash six billion off of the National Institutes of Health.
[03:24:57.872 --> 03:24:58.952]  He didn't have to do that.
[03:24:58.952 --> 03:25:00.453]  Nobody had to do that.
[03:25:00.453 --> 03:25:01.494]  Somebody there
[03:25:03.035 --> 03:25:11.262]  gave him the deal and said, this is a place where we got to stop funding because you know what these guys are doing?
[03:25:11.262 --> 03:25:28.678]  Destructive chemotherapy, destructive radiation, failed war on cancer, the most arrogant scientists in the world that do research that harms people, that develops horrendously toxic drugs, etc, etc, etc.
[03:25:28.678 --> 03:25:29.478]  That's what these
[03:25:31.417 --> 03:25:41.544]  Little gods have been putting out there for the last 50 years, destroying the population, eating the population out from within.
[03:25:41.544 --> 03:25:42.545]  Yeah, you're right.
[03:25:42.545 --> 03:25:43.165]  What do we do?
[03:25:43.165 --> 03:25:46.527]  Well, let's start off with a big cut.
[03:25:46.527 --> 03:25:48.328]  Six billion off their budget.
[03:25:48.328 --> 03:25:52.391]  Ah, the scientists are screaming bloody murder.
[03:25:52.391 --> 03:25:55.733]  This is going to doom all of humanity to destruction.
[03:25:55.733 --> 03:25:57.915]  No, it's actually going to free up humanity.
[03:25:58.996 --> 03:26:01.077]  It's actually going to free up humanity.
[03:26:01.077 --> 03:26:05.960]  And it's going to take these little gods off their thrones.
[03:26:05.960 --> 03:26:14.025]  Slash more than 50% of the US funding for the United Nations.
[03:26:15.046 --> 03:26:17.207]  Which is 10 billion a year.
[03:26:17.207 --> 03:26:38.297]  10 billion a year to float this giant carcass on the east side of New York where all these diplomats can come and pretend that they're doing something while the United Nations is plotting through every community in the United States and in other countries to destroy freedom and choice of where you live and how you live.
[03:26:39.361 --> 03:26:43.704]  Under the rubric of sustainable development and so forth and so on.
[03:26:43.704 --> 03:26:47.067]  Yeah, let's take away half to start with.
[03:26:47.067 --> 03:26:48.568]  Let's see how they squirm.
[03:26:48.568 --> 03:26:52.330]  Let's take six billion off the National Institutes of Health.
[03:26:52.330 --> 03:26:59.716]  And let's, in the process, actually bring back some health instead of medical destruction.
[03:26:59.716 --> 03:27:02.257]  These are major stories, folks.
[03:27:03.328 --> 03:27:09.531]  Now you may not see it that way initially, particularly the story about the National Institutes of Health.
[03:27:09.531 --> 03:27:21.517]  I've spewed out numbers and statistics on this program and in my articles for years and years now about, you know, conservative estimate, mainstream, meticulous, conservative estimate.
[03:27:21.517 --> 03:27:23.659]  The medical system kills 225,000 people a year in the United States.
[03:27:23.659 --> 03:27:24.779]  That's 2.25 million people per decade.
[03:27:30.558 --> 03:27:40.683]  And other studies and other statistics and so forth and horrendous severe adverse effects from vaccines and so on and so forth.
[03:27:40.683 --> 03:27:47.085]  Cutting six billion off their budget at NIH is a very big deal.
[03:27:47.085 --> 03:27:52.288]  A very good deal for the American people.
[03:27:52.288 --> 03:27:55.369]  So let's keep that in mind.
[03:27:55.369 --> 03:27:59.231]  So let me echo Alex about
[03:28:00.504 --> 03:28:08.248]  Storeable, select storeable food at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:28:08.248 --> 03:28:14.912]  Limited time, 30 to 40 off, so you better get there now.

[03:28:29.285 --> 03:28:31.846]  Made in the USA.
[03:28:31.846 --> 03:28:44.512]  30 to 40 off on all InfoWars select storable food at InfoWarsStore.com today for a limited time.
[03:28:44.512 --> 03:28:49.454]  You buy great health, great food, great products.
[03:28:49.454 --> 03:28:51.195]  Your survival.
[03:28:51.195 --> 03:28:54.957]  You support InfoWars in the mission.
[03:28:54.957 --> 03:28:56.698]  The mission is freedom.
[03:28:57.577 --> 03:28:59.597]  That's the story.
[03:28:59.597 --> 03:29:02.438]  When you get down to the bottom line, that's what we're talking about.
[03:29:02.438 --> 03:29:05.699]  All good things come from freedom.
[03:29:05.699 --> 03:29:09.060]  All bad things come from globalism.
[03:29:09.060 --> 03:29:16.301]  It's not that much a rocket science, folks.
[03:29:16.301 --> 03:29:21.763]  They want to control you and everybody else.
[03:29:21.763 --> 03:29:22.963]  We'll be back after the break.
[03:29:49.047 --> 03:29:52.975]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:29:52.975 --> 03:29:55.660]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.069 --> 03:30:04.552]  WikiLeaks continues to expose the nightmarish surveillance state in which we currently live.
[03:30:04.552 --> 03:30:14.579]  As the Vault 7 leaks continue, we learn more about how the surveillance grid works, and how governments use it to spy on interesting people, or how a hacker could get access to virtually anything.
[03:30:14.579 --> 03:30:18.222]  Now WikiLeaks has released Dark Matter, the latest leak in the Vault 7 collection.
[03:30:18.222 --> 03:30:25.187]  Dark Matter claims the CIA has been bugging cell phones right out of the factory since 2008, which is right when smartphones began to take over the market.
[03:30:25.307 --> 03:30:32.149]  This comes at the hands of the Embedded Development Branch, who develop software that is ingrained into cell phones' firmware, making it there permanently.
[03:30:32.149 --> 03:30:38.972]  Combine that with all the terms and conditions we blindly agree to with every new app we download, a cell phone is a government portal to your life.
[03:30:38.972 --> 03:30:47.715]  Other such CIA operations and technology such as Dark Sea Skies, Night Skies 1.2, Sonic Screwdriver, and more will be included in the latest release.
[03:30:47.935 --> 03:30:50.637]  All of which seem to directly target Apple products.
[03:30:50.637 --> 03:30:55.342]  More we'll be breaking from WikiLeaks today on Dark Matter, including a live stream of Julian Assange.
[03:30:55.342 --> 03:30:57.744]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[03:30:57.744 --> 03:30:59.766]  Be careful with that government probe droid.
[03:30:59.766 --> 03:31:00.606]  Hey, everyone!
[03:31:00.606 --> 03:31:02.888]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[03:31:02.888 --> 03:31:06.732]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[03:31:06.732 --> 03:31:08.814]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[03:31:08.814 --> 03:31:11.296]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in healthcare, nearly $10,000 per
[03:31:12.697 --> 03:31:14.559]  Man, woman and child in this country.
[03:31:14.559 --> 03:31:19.062]  Obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[03:31:19.062 --> 03:31:25.528]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[03:31:25.528 --> 03:31:39.960]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats
[03:31:40.080 --> 03:31:40.260]  Thank you.
[03:31:59.631 --> 03:32:03.793]  There was a mighty nation, blessed above all of creation.
[03:32:03.793 --> 03:32:06.614]  Charlie Daniels, he's always loved America.
[03:32:06.614 --> 03:32:08.094]  Let me just read a little thing here.
[03:32:08.094 --> 03:32:12.336]  The American system of justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world.
[03:32:12.336 --> 03:32:16.137]  Individual rights will have to take a back seat to the collective.
[03:32:16.137 --> 03:32:17.818]  Well, you know what the next move's gonna be, don't you?
[03:32:17.818 --> 03:32:19.378]  It's gonna be coming after your gun.
[03:32:19.378 --> 03:32:19.798]  Oh, yeah.
[03:32:19.798 --> 03:32:21.939]  I tell you, it ain't gonna sit well down my way.
[03:32:21.939 --> 03:32:22.539]  At all.
[03:32:22.539 --> 03:32:23.600]  It ain't gonna sit well.
[03:32:23.600 --> 03:32:26.001]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[03:32:26.001 --> 03:32:26.701]  They lost.
[03:32:27.301 --> 03:32:30.343]  I want to see what Trump's up against.
[03:32:30.343 --> 03:32:31.484]  It's time to ride, boss.
[03:32:31.484 --> 03:32:33.385]  We need a thousand Paul Revere's.
[03:32:33.385 --> 03:32:39.468]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom, and apple pie.
[03:32:39.468 --> 03:32:41.810]  And beef was for supper.
[03:32:41.810 --> 03:32:44.431]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[03:32:44.431 --> 03:32:46.092]  Theatrical screenings on demand.
[03:32:46.092 --> 03:32:47.773]  DVDs now available.
[03:32:47.773 --> 03:32:52.076]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[03:32:52.456 --> 03:32:55.819]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[03:32:55.819 --> 03:32:58.140]  RevelationsTheMovie.info.
[03:32:58.140 --> 03:33:05.266]  Let's fix it.
[03:33:05.266 --> 03:33:14.152]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:33:14.152 --> 03:33:15.934]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:21.983 --> 03:33:27.726]  John Rappaport back here in the fourth hour on InfoWars.
[03:33:27.726 --> 03:33:45.797]  The reason that I keep on and keep on and keep on about the medical tyranny is because the medical tyranny is one of the great or the greatest arm of the globalist enterprise.
[03:33:45.797 --> 03:33:48.699]  Because it poisons you.
[03:33:50.163 --> 03:33:57.209]  It poisons you in many ways, in many forms, in many medicines.
[03:33:57.209 --> 03:33:59.712]  Documented this for years on end.
[03:33:59.712 --> 03:34:03.435]  Used to wonder why, why is this happening?
[03:34:03.435 --> 03:34:15.346]  Sitting there at my desk, I can still see it in Hollywood, one drug after another in front of me, laid out on a long table, the so-called adverse effects of each one.
[03:34:16.542 --> 03:34:18.904]  How many millions of people are we talking about here?
[03:34:18.904 --> 03:34:24.588]  10, 20, 30, 100 million that are taking at least one of these drugs?
[03:34:24.588 --> 03:34:25.589]  What is going on here?
[03:34:25.589 --> 03:34:27.991]  Eating the country out from the inside.
[03:34:27.991 --> 03:34:29.232]  Well, where did this all come from?
[03:34:29.232 --> 03:34:31.913]  This is Rockefeller Medicine.
[03:34:31.913 --> 03:34:33.735]  This is where it came from.
[03:34:33.735 --> 03:34:36.957]  In case you don't know, the Flexner Report, early in the 20th century,
[03:34:38.595 --> 03:35:05.720]  The attempt to revolutionize all medicine, to make it pharmaceutical, to edge out and destroy the competitors who actually have healing, and to institute this giant fortress all over the world, cradle-to-grave, or you could say, womb-to-grave system, every citizen in lockstep from
[03:35:06.536 --> 03:35:08.377]  Beginning to the end.
[03:35:08.377 --> 03:35:15.523]  Diagnosed with 20 or 30 or 40 different so-called diseases and mental disorders.
[03:35:15.523 --> 03:35:19.386]  Drugged to the gills.
[03:35:19.386 --> 03:35:20.426]  Toxified.
[03:35:20.426 --> 03:35:21.127]  Poisoned.
[03:35:21.127 --> 03:35:22.208]  Disoriented.
[03:35:22.208 --> 03:35:22.788]  Weakened.
[03:35:22.788 --> 03:35:24.029]  Disabled.
[03:35:24.029 --> 03:35:25.090]  Unable to think.
[03:35:25.090 --> 03:35:32.335]  Unable... You want to know what the zombie effect... That's what that's all... That's where that comes from.
[03:35:32.335 --> 03:35:33.356]  That's what's happening.
[03:35:35.498 --> 03:35:48.164]  And people are coming out of that trance and one of the ways they're coming out of it is with alternative healing, which is traditional healing in many respects.
[03:35:48.164 --> 03:35:56.088]  Millions and millions and millions of people in America alone who are fully aware of this.
[03:35:56.088 --> 03:36:03.512]  In the early 1990s when I was hip deep in the so-called health freedom movement, ran for seat in the Congress out of
[03:36:04.170 --> 03:36:06.231]  Los Angeles on that platform.
[03:36:06.231 --> 03:36:07.611]  It was all about freedom.
[03:36:07.611 --> 03:36:10.373]  You have the freedom to manage your own health.
[03:36:10.373 --> 03:36:17.455]  You have the freedom to decide what to do with your body in terms of health, in terms of healing.
[03:36:17.455 --> 03:36:19.236]  That's the story.
[03:36:19.236 --> 03:36:21.857]  That's what it is.
[03:36:21.857 --> 03:36:24.158]  There was no internet.
[03:36:24.158 --> 03:36:25.499]  There was no email.
[03:36:25.499 --> 03:36:26.799]  There were no cell phones.
[03:36:26.799 --> 03:36:28.220]  There was no social media.
[03:36:28.220 --> 03:36:29.821]  There was no nothing.
[03:36:29.821 --> 03:36:33.122]  And on that issue, the Congress received
[03:36:34.335 --> 03:36:52.293]  Millions of letters, written, typed letters from Americans demanding that they have their own health freedom and that the FDA get its nose out of trying to over-regulate nutritional supplements.
[03:36:52.293 --> 03:36:57.858]  More letters came into Congress on that issue than any other in the nation's history.
[03:36:59.175 --> 03:37:08.839]  Those people are still around, as are their children who have grown up healthy.
[03:37:08.839 --> 03:37:14.501]  The Rockefeller System of Medicine, which was instituted around the world,
[03:37:16.420 --> 03:37:20.861]  Has the overall prime effect of destroying populations.
[03:37:20.861 --> 03:37:23.082]  It is population control.
[03:37:23.082 --> 03:37:24.923]  It is depopulation.
[03:37:24.923 --> 03:37:26.643]  It is poison.
[03:37:26.643 --> 03:37:28.164]  It is toxification.
[03:37:28.164 --> 03:37:30.064]  It is all of those things.
[03:37:30.064 --> 03:37:35.706]  And the documents, the studies, the reports are all there to prove it.
[03:37:35.706 --> 03:37:37.667]  I've laid it out many times.
[03:37:37.667 --> 03:37:40.248]  It's all there.
[03:37:40.248 --> 03:37:42.708]  It's out in the open.
[03:37:42.708 --> 03:37:43.929]  And now, for example,
[03:37:45.293 --> 03:37:52.037]  In New Zealand, it looks like they're about to drown the whole country in fluoride.
[03:37:52.037 --> 03:37:54.258]  Another poison.
[03:37:54.258 --> 03:37:58.700]  Another brain-disabling medical treatment.
[03:37:58.700 --> 03:38:10.386]  Because they're going to basically hand over the decision as to whether to fluoridate areas and provinces and counties and so forth to the federal government.
[03:38:10.386 --> 03:38:12.087]  That's the bottom line.
[03:38:12.087 --> 03:38:13.968]  That's what they're about to vote on over there.
[03:38:15.384 --> 03:38:18.566]  And it looks like that's the way they're going to go.
[03:38:18.566 --> 03:38:21.989]  Into more medical slavery.
[03:38:21.989 --> 03:38:24.370]  Because that's what this stuff is.
[03:38:24.370 --> 03:38:28.613]  And did you know where fluorides came from originally?
[03:38:28.613 --> 03:38:30.735]  From the Manhattan Project.
[03:38:30.735 --> 03:38:36.399]  The project in the United States to build an atomic bomb on the East Coast, New Jersey, Delaware.
[03:38:36.399 --> 03:38:44.104]  The main effluent that flowed out of that manufacturing and research process was fluorides.
[03:38:46.129 --> 03:39:06.402]  And a study written at the time, a report indicated, because there was great damage in farmers' fields and animals dying and plants being destroyed, food crops and so forth, that it was really the fluoride component and not the uranium component that was causing the majority of the damage.
[03:39:06.402 --> 03:39:10.484]  And they had to do something about that real quick.
[03:39:10.484 --> 03:39:13.366]  And so it was suggested out of the blue.
[03:39:14.585 --> 03:39:20.030]  Well, maybe we could call this, let's see, a dental treatment.
[03:39:20.030 --> 03:39:22.051]  How about that?
[03:39:22.051 --> 03:39:34.222]  We'll settle these lawsuits from these farmers quietly, okay, and then we'll send people around the country lecturing on how fluorides are a wonderful treatment for teeth.
[03:39:34.222 --> 03:39:36.223]  How about that?
[03:39:36.223 --> 03:39:37.584]  Well, okay, why not?
[03:39:37.584 --> 03:39:38.065]  Let's go.
[03:39:38.065 --> 03:39:42.569]  Propaganda.
[03:39:42.569 --> 03:39:42.909]  It worked.
[03:39:43.883 --> 03:39:44.423]  It worked!
[03:39:44.423 --> 03:39:47.386]  It actually worked!
[03:39:47.386 --> 03:39:54.271]  This toothpaste contains the same material that ran off from the A-bomb project.
[03:39:54.271 --> 03:39:56.312]  Happy brushing!
[03:39:56.312 --> 03:39:58.214]  Have fun!
[03:39:58.214 --> 03:39:59.195]  Good health to you!
[03:39:59.195 --> 03:40:07.481]  Hope you don't incur any brain damage or cracking of bones.
[03:40:09.844 --> 03:40:34.354]  The Union of Scientists at the EPA, at the Environmental Protection Agency, the head of that union, William Hersey, in 1999, wrote a long letter, public statement, it wasn't a secret report, out in the open, representing the Union of Scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency, saying fluorides are dangerous.
[03:40:34.354 --> 03:40:37.115]  And he went down chapter and verse, chapter and verse, chapter and verse.
[03:40:40.396 --> 03:40:41.977]  And he mentioned John Calhoun.
[03:40:41.977 --> 03:40:44.739]  I think that's his name.
[03:40:44.739 --> 03:40:52.184]  Scientist in New Zealand who was commissioned to do a study on fluorides was absolutely convinced that it was safe and effective, wonderful.
[03:40:52.184 --> 03:40:58.829]  All of a sudden changed his tune when he actually looked into what was happening there.
[03:40:58.829 --> 03:41:00.310]  We're not going to let that out.
[03:41:00.310 --> 03:41:01.631]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:41:01.631 --> 03:41:06.895]  So now they're going to try to drown the entire country of New Zealand in fluorides.
[03:41:06.895 --> 03:41:08.756]  That's a medical treatment, by the way, folks.
[03:41:09.471 --> 03:41:11.493]  Did anybody ask you whether you wanted it?
[03:41:11.493 --> 03:41:13.154]  Is there any informed consent?
[03:41:13.154 --> 03:41:13.815]  Any freedom?
[03:41:13.815 --> 03:41:14.515]  Any choice?
[03:41:14.515 --> 03:41:14.956]  No!
[03:41:14.956 --> 03:41:16.937]  Absolutely not!
[03:41:16.937 --> 03:41:21.161]  Absolutely not!
[03:41:21.161 --> 03:41:34.833]  Speaking of which, it's a good segue, InfoWarsLife.com, super blue, fluoride-free, fluoride-free toothpaste, back in stock.

[03:41:47.813 --> 03:41:49.694]  Halogen.

[03:41:54.475 --> 03:41:55.355]  Natural oils.
[03:41:55.355 --> 03:41:57.576]  Ingredients.
[03:41:57.576 --> 03:41:58.496]  Peppermint oil.
[03:41:58.496 --> 03:41:59.036]  Iodine.
[03:41:59.036 --> 03:42:02.057]  Nano silver added in.
[03:42:02.057 --> 03:42:03.497]  A new version for kids.
[03:42:05.680 --> 03:42:07.480]  It's back in stock for how long?
[03:42:07.480 --> 03:42:08.041]  Don't know.
[03:42:08.041 --> 03:42:11.681]  Go there now.
[03:42:11.681 --> 03:42:20.604]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is back in stock at Infowarslife.com.
[03:42:20.604 --> 03:42:22.024]  Get it.
[03:42:22.024 --> 03:42:24.925]  Help the show.
[03:42:24.925 --> 03:42:27.105]  Help spread the word.
[03:42:27.105 --> 03:42:29.806]  We're talking about the breakout.
[03:42:31.257 --> 03:42:33.339]  This is the breakout.
[03:42:33.339 --> 03:42:38.242]  You know the way stock traders say, well stocks are trading here and then it broke out.
[03:42:38.242 --> 03:42:39.784]  It broke out.
[03:42:39.784 --> 03:42:44.607]  We're talking about freedom breaking out.
[03:42:44.607 --> 03:42:49.731]  The overthrow of globalist forces.
[03:42:49.731 --> 03:42:51.172]  What's their agenda?
[03:42:51.172 --> 03:42:52.573]  Global government.
[03:42:52.573 --> 03:43:00.019]  One global management system for the planet, just in case you need to be reminded or you didn't know.
[03:43:00.019 --> 03:43:00.820]  Central point
[03:43:02.011 --> 03:43:07.115]  That controls production and distribution of all goods and services.
[03:43:07.115 --> 03:43:08.896]  You get this, you get that.
[03:43:08.896 --> 03:43:11.178]  You can eat, you can't.
[03:43:11.178 --> 03:43:29.872]  It also, through its flagrantly false so-called climate agenda, aims to reduce the overall energy production of all countries on the planet by a significant amount in order to stave off absolute collapse due to CO2.
[03:43:33.027 --> 03:43:35.968]  Entirely fraudulent science.
[03:43:35.968 --> 03:43:59.080]  But, reduction in energy production, in other words, torpedoing every economy, disabling the people in every possible way, the migrant floods, the open borders, inducing more chaos, more crime, more destruction, more attacks,
[03:44:00.962 --> 03:44:05.346]  And clamping down with heavier security, etc., etc.
[03:44:05.346 --> 03:44:07.868]  Getting the picture?
[03:44:07.868 --> 03:44:10.991]  The takeover.
[03:44:10.991 --> 03:44:17.557]  Ripping untold numbers of jobs, good jobs, away from industrial countries.
[03:44:17.557 --> 03:44:21.201]  Setting up factories in third world hell holes.
[03:44:21.201 --> 03:44:22.222]  Slave labor.
[03:44:22.222 --> 03:44:24.464]  No environmental rules whatsoever.
[03:44:26.528 --> 03:44:34.910]  Exporting those products back to the industrial countries with no tariffs to be paid, no tax, no penalty.
[03:44:34.910 --> 03:44:41.851]  Undermining, torpedoing the economy of all the industrialized nations.
[03:44:41.851 --> 03:44:43.031]  All these vectors.
[03:44:43.031 --> 03:44:45.511]  This is the globalist program.
[03:44:45.511 --> 03:44:52.113]  One world, unfree, under the control of one authority.
[03:44:52.113 --> 03:44:54.053]  We know best.
[03:44:54.053 --> 03:44:54.513]  Sure they do.
[03:44:56.357 --> 03:45:00.859]  The breakout is freedom coming out of that.
[03:45:00.859 --> 03:45:04.080]  Exit from the European Union.
[03:45:04.080 --> 03:45:07.842]  Exit from globalism in America.
[03:45:07.842 --> 03:45:16.246]  Exit from imprisonment inside the medical cartel.
[03:45:16.246 --> 03:45:24.189]  The covert op, primo covert op arm of the globalists via Rockefeller Medicine.
[03:45:25.663 --> 03:45:27.304]  That's the deal.
[03:45:27.304 --> 03:45:29.606]  That's the way it works.
[03:45:29.606 --> 03:45:46.101]  So when I say, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, the proposal of the Trump White House is, let's slash six billion a year from government medical research.
[03:45:46.101 --> 03:45:48.002]  They know something, folks.
[03:45:48.002 --> 03:45:49.564]  They know something.
[03:45:49.564 --> 03:45:52.126]  This isn't just, well, we don't need that much.
[03:45:52.126 --> 03:45:53.347]  No, no, they know something.
[03:45:54.648 --> 03:46:06.659]  They know that that is one of the primary research centers for Toxic Central to toxify the population.
[03:46:06.659 --> 03:46:10.623]  Yeah, let's cut six billion from those guys.
[03:46:10.623 --> 03:46:11.824]  They think they're entitled.
[03:46:11.824 --> 03:46:14.306]  They are the most arrogant scientists in the world.
[03:46:14.306 --> 03:46:20.972]  They think only they know and the people are completely stupid and we will foist anything we want to on them.
[03:46:24.318 --> 03:46:26.120]  No.
[03:46:26.120 --> 03:46:28.763]  It's a changing world, my friends.
[03:46:28.763 --> 03:46:29.944]  It's a changing world.
[03:46:29.944 --> 03:46:33.728]  It's not going on in the same way.
[03:46:33.728 --> 03:46:41.456]  Just the mention of slashing six billion, and then let's cut 50% from the U.S.
[03:46:41.456 --> 03:46:46.902]  supporting that gigantic welfare state on the east side of Manhattan called the U.N.
[03:46:48.595 --> 03:46:56.538]  Let's cut, I don't know, 50% off their 10 billion that we, the people, pay for.
[03:46:56.538 --> 03:46:59.739]  For the UN, the United Nations.
[03:46:59.739 --> 03:47:14.265]  In addition to Agenda 21 and all of that stuff, don't forget the World Health Organization, home of every fake epidemic that's ever been touted in order to force people and coerce them and brainwash them into getting toxic vaccines.
[03:47:15.595 --> 03:47:18.917]  Yes, toxic vaccines.
[03:47:18.917 --> 03:47:22.480]  Read the ingredient list.
[03:47:22.480 --> 03:47:25.342]  Oh, these bloggers, say, who live in mommy's basement.
[03:47:25.342 --> 03:47:29.145]  Oh, these fools that talk about toxic vaccines.
[03:47:29.145 --> 03:47:31.866]  These are the safest, most wonderful things ever invented.
[03:47:31.866 --> 03:47:32.547]  Sure they are.
[03:47:32.547 --> 03:47:35.169]  Sure they are.
[03:47:35.169 --> 03:47:42.374]  The bulk of immunity in the Western world, in any world, produced
[03:47:43.863 --> 03:48:00.036]  Immunity from childhood diseases occurred as a result of improved nutrition, the rise of the middle class, sanitation, if you've ever heard of that, lack of overcrowding.
[03:48:00.036 --> 03:48:09.604]  That's why populations developed immunity way before vaccines were ever introduced, way before antibiotics were ever introduced.
[03:48:11.185 --> 03:48:14.127]  All non-medical reasons.
[03:48:14.127 --> 03:48:16.848]  All non-medical reasons.
[03:48:16.848 --> 03:48:19.330]  A strong immune system.
[03:48:19.330 --> 03:48:20.710]  That's what people need.
[03:48:20.710 --> 03:48:25.013]  Natural immunity is what people need.
[03:48:25.013 --> 03:48:31.456]  Absolute natural immunity.
[03:48:31.456 --> 03:48:33.277]  Getting where I'm going here?
[03:48:33.277 --> 03:48:35.978]  I hope so.
[03:48:35.978 --> 03:48:38.460]  Because freedom has to break out everywhere.
[03:48:39.531 --> 03:48:48.337]  Everywhere where the globalists have their hands in, that's where it has to break out.
[03:48:48.337 --> 03:48:53.460]  And it is breaking out.
[03:48:53.460 --> 03:49:07.069]  All those millions of health freedom people, many of whom I was in contact with in the early 1990s, many of whom came forward when I was running for a seat in Congress, come on back,
[03:49:08.720 --> 03:49:10.341]  Now is the time.
[03:49:10.341 --> 03:49:12.522]  Wake up.
[03:49:12.522 --> 03:49:34.234]  Your radical revolutionary spirit of freedom, which by the way was the most powerful that I've ever encountered in my life because these people knew in their bones and blood and cells how important it was that they have a choice, unlimited choice for how to take care of their own health.
[03:49:36.308 --> 03:49:37.549]  Come on back.
[03:49:37.549 --> 03:49:39.310]  Now is the time.
[03:49:39.310 --> 03:49:43.312]  Now is the time to spread the word.
[03:49:43.312 --> 03:49:44.732]  Freedom.
[03:49:44.732 --> 03:49:47.694]  That's where we're going.
[03:49:47.694 --> 03:49:59.840]  That isn't left or right or center or Democrat or Republican or this or that or whatever group has been hijacked.
[03:49:59.840 --> 03:50:01.261]  No.
[03:50:01.261 --> 03:50:02.921]  It's the basis.
[03:50:02.921 --> 03:50:03.662]  It's the basis.
[03:50:05.003 --> 03:50:10.506]  It's why the Constitution required limited government.
[03:50:10.506 --> 03:50:11.926]  Severely limited government.
[03:50:11.926 --> 03:50:15.828]  Why else do you think?
[03:50:15.828 --> 03:50:18.509]  They knew about the European monarchies.
[03:50:18.509 --> 03:50:26.053]  They knew about these pompous idiots on their thrones who claim to have divine right to rule.
[03:50:26.053 --> 03:50:28.734]  Well, yes, I have divine right to rule.
[03:50:28.734 --> 03:50:29.974]  It's been granted to me here.
[03:50:29.974 --> 03:50:30.995]  It's on this piece of paper.
[03:50:33.817 --> 03:50:34.798]  No.
[03:50:34.798 --> 03:50:36.480]  Freedom.
[03:50:36.480 --> 03:50:38.041]  Limited government.
[03:50:38.041 --> 03:50:39.002]  We'll be back.
[03:50:59.963 --> 03:51:01.604]  This is Elizabeth McCabe, a.k.a.
[03:51:01.604 --> 03:51:03.444]  Lucky One, of Truth Frequency News.
[03:51:03.444 --> 03:51:06.446]  I wanted to tell you all about ExtendoVite from HeartDrop.com.
[03:51:06.446 --> 03:51:08.746]  Y'all know I check everything before I air it.
[03:51:08.746 --> 03:51:13.168]  When I heard about ExtendoVite on TFR, I went to HeartDrop.com and started my research.
[03:51:13.168 --> 03:51:14.369]  It's got cayenne.
[03:51:14.369 --> 03:51:15.769]  That's good for blood and circulation.
[03:51:15.769 --> 03:51:17.210]  It stimulates the blood flow.
[03:51:17.210 --> 03:51:22.272]  It's got garlic, which fights bacteria like antibiotics, and it lowers the cholesterol and blood pressure.
[03:51:22.272 --> 03:51:25.253]  It also has milk thistle, which is the best detox for liver.
[03:51:25.253 --> 03:51:27.894]  I couldn't wait to try it out, and I'm glad I did four months ago.
[03:51:28.174 --> 03:51:29.695]  And here's Alfie's results.
[03:51:29.695 --> 03:51:31.237]  My hands and feet don't get cold anymore.
[03:51:31.237 --> 03:51:33.599]  The varicose veins have faded too.
[03:51:33.599 --> 03:51:35.640]  My wrists don't hurt after typing all day.

[03:52:00.223 --> 03:52:12.807]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine, and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds, and antidepressants.
[03:52:12.807 --> 03:52:16.828]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.

[03:53:38.443 --> 03:53:41.785]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[03:53:41.785 --> 03:53:43.827]  So the body is an amazing thing.

[03:53:54.793 --> 03:53:57.274]  He's pounding down, loaded up and trucking.
[03:53:57.274 --> 03:54:12.782]  We're gonna do what they say can't be done.
[03:54:12.782 --> 03:54:15.443]  We've got a lot
[03:54:23.698 --> 03:54:24.458]  Okay, we're back.
[03:54:24.458 --> 03:54:27.760]  John Rappaport here in the fourth hour on InfoWars.
[03:54:27.760 --> 03:54:30.860]  We have a few minutes left here.
[03:54:30.860 --> 03:54:34.942]  So, let's see.
[03:54:34.942 --> 03:54:40.123]  Here's the story.
[03:54:40.123 --> 03:54:51.487]  They're going to start, and they've already started because you can see with SB-277, if you haven't heard of it in California, mandating vaccines for school children.
[03:54:53.342 --> 03:55:00.087]  There are, at last count, I think it was 135 bills up in a number of states.
[03:55:00.087 --> 03:55:07.312]  Some, you know, really outrageous number, in one way or another trying to mandate vaccination.
[03:55:07.312 --> 03:55:09.254]  No informed consent, no freedom.
[03:55:09.254 --> 03:55:10.755]  Hey, we don't care about that.
[03:55:10.755 --> 03:55:18.821]  You're going to see increasing attacks along the line of medical and health.
[03:55:20.583 --> 03:55:21.384]  More.
[03:55:21.384 --> 03:55:22.444]  It's coming.
[03:55:22.444 --> 03:55:28.409]  Because they, the globalists, have to keep forcing this down our throats.
[03:55:28.409 --> 03:55:31.331]  They have to.
[03:55:31.331 --> 03:55:39.477]  I can't emphasize strongly enough how central the medical cartel is to the globalist army as it marches forward.
[03:55:39.477 --> 03:55:41.218]  I've already explained it.
[03:55:41.218 --> 03:55:45.461]  I just can have to say it again.
[03:55:45.461 --> 03:55:48.243]  They've got to keep doing that.
[03:55:48.243 --> 03:55:48.764]  Because
[03:55:50.402 --> 03:56:01.810]  If you've got the freedom to decide every issue about your own health, that's a hell of a freedom.
[03:56:01.810 --> 03:56:03.732]  Think about it.
[03:56:03.732 --> 03:56:07.194]  It radiates out from you.
[03:56:07.194 --> 03:56:09.716]  Well, I tried this and I got healthier.
[03:56:09.716 --> 03:56:10.837]  Wow!
[03:56:10.837 --> 03:56:17.462]  That was me and whatever I did, whatever I used, my choice, whoever I went to see,
[03:56:19.804 --> 03:56:26.969]  And a contagion of freedom begins from there, as it has for untold millions of people.
[03:56:26.969 --> 03:56:29.911]  That's why they're so radical.
[03:56:29.911 --> 03:56:31.572]  They know what freedom is.
[03:56:31.572 --> 03:56:38.416]  They've experienced it in their own bodies, minds, psyches, souls, you know?
[03:56:38.416 --> 03:56:47.422]  Well, now that I've got this freedom and I'm stronger, more alive, more alert, more powerful, more real, more energetic,
[03:56:49.278 --> 03:56:50.980]  Let's see what else is happening.
[03:56:50.980 --> 03:56:51.780]  Oh, wow!
[03:56:51.780 --> 03:56:55.764]  There's another area of horrendous globalist oppression over there.
[03:56:55.764 --> 03:56:56.945]  And there's another one over there.
[03:56:56.945 --> 03:56:57.686]  Wow!
[03:56:57.686 --> 03:56:59.708]  I didn't see that before.
[03:56:59.708 --> 03:57:02.711]  We've got to get rid of all of that, you see.
[03:57:02.711 --> 03:57:04.293]  Whereas if they can keep you...
[03:57:05.808 --> 03:57:18.871]  In the system, more and more drugs, more sick, more symptoms, more diagnoses, more this, more that, more doctors clucking at you, and, oh, well, now you've got blah, blah, blah, blah, and we have to give you this toxic drug.
[03:57:18.871 --> 03:57:22.851]  You know, that's what they're doing.
[03:57:22.851 --> 03:57:25.492]  Diabolical, really.
[03:57:25.492 --> 03:57:27.632]  Diabolical.
[03:57:27.632 --> 03:57:31.493]  And a lot of the doctors know it, and they still do it.
[03:57:32.597 --> 03:57:35.398]  But out here is all the freedom.
[03:57:35.398 --> 03:57:38.200]  Big time freedom.
[03:57:38.200 --> 03:57:40.821]  And as I say, it's contagious.
[03:57:40.821 --> 03:57:43.502]  It rolls.
[03:57:43.502 --> 03:57:48.705]  I did something based on my own freedom and it made me better.
[03:57:48.705 --> 03:57:50.486]  Wow!
[03:57:50.486 --> 03:57:51.446]  I feel better.
[03:57:51.446 --> 03:57:53.027]  I am better.
[03:57:53.027 --> 03:57:55.728]  What else can I do?
[03:57:55.728 --> 03:57:58.770]  There's lots you can do.
[03:57:58.770 --> 03:58:00.251]  The Breakout, folks.
[03:58:00.251 --> 03:58:00.591]  Freedom.
[03:58:01.556 --> 03:58:04.279]  Thanks for your attention.
